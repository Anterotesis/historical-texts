<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DIFFERENT SPECIES of PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<P>MORAL philosophy, or the science of human
nature, may be treated after two different
manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and
may contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and
reformation of mankind. The one considers man
chiefly as born for action; and as influenced in his
actions by taste and sentiment; pursuing one object,
and avoiding another, according to the value which
these objects seem to possess, and according to the
light in which they present themselves. Virtue, of all
objects, is the most valuable and lovely; and accor∣dingly
this species of philosophers paint her in the
most amiable colours; borrowing all helps from poe∣try
and eloquence, and treating their subject in an
easy and obvious manner, such as is best fitted to
please the imagination, and engage the affections.
They select the most striking observations and in∣stances
from common life; place opposite characters
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
in a proper contrast; and alluring us into the paths
of virtue by the views of glory and happiness, direct
our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and
most illustrious examples. They make us <HI>feel</HI> the
difference betwixt vice and virtue; they excite and
regulate our sentiments; and so they can but bend
our hearts to the love of probity and true honour,
they think, that they have fully attained the end of all
their labours.</P>
<P>THE other species of philosophers treat man rather
as a reasonable than an active being, and endeavour
to form his understanding more than cultivate his
manners. They regard mankind as a subject of spe∣culation;
and with a narrow scrutiny examine human
nature, in order to find those principles, which regu∣late
our understanding, excite our sentiments, and
make us approve or blame any particular object, ac∣tion,
or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all
literature, that philosophy should not yet have fixed,
beyond controversy, the foundation of morals, reason∣ing,
and criticism, and should for ever talk of truth
and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity,
without being able to determine the source of these
distinctions. While they attempt this arduous task,
they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding
from particular instances to general principles, they
still push on their inquiries to principles more gene∣ral,
and rest not satisfied till they arrive at those ori∣ginal
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
principles, by which, in every science, all hu∣man
cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iosity must be bounded. Tho' their specula∣tions
seem abstract, and even unintelligible to com∣mon
readers, they please themselves with the appro∣bation
of the learned and the wise; and think them∣selves
sufficiently compensated for the labours of their
whole lives, if they can discover some hidden truths,
which may contribute to the instruction of posterity.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the easy and obvious philosophy
will always, with the generality of mankind, have
the preference to the accurate and abstruse; and by
many will be recommended, not only as more agree∣able,
but more useful than the other. It enters more
into common life; moulds the heart and affections;
and, by touching those principles which actuate men,
reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer that mo∣del
of perfection which it describes. On the contrary,
the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of
mind, which cannot enter into business and action,
vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade, and
comes into open day; nor can its principles easily re∣tain
any influence over our conduct and behaviour.
The feelings of our sentiments, the agitations of our
passions, the vehemence of our affections, dissipate all
its conclusions, and reduce the profound philosopher
to a mere plebeian.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9"/>
THIS also must be confessed, that the most durable,
as well as justest fame has been acquired by the easy
philosophy, and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto
to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation, from
the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have
not been able to support their renown with more
equitable posterity. 'Tis easy for a profound philo∣sopher
to commit a mistake in his subtile reasonings;
and one mistake is the necessary parent of another,
while he pushes on his consequences, and is not de∣terred
from embracing any conclusion, by its unusual
appearance, or its contradiction to popular opinion.
But a philosopher, who proposes only to represent the
common sense of mankind in more beautiful and
more engaging colours, if by accident he commits a
mistake, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal to
common sense, and the natural sentiments of the
mind, returns into the right path, and secures him∣self
from any dangerous illusions. The fame of CI∣CERO
flourishes at present; but that of ARISTOTLE
is utterly decayed. La BRUYERE passes the seas,
and still maintains his reputation: But the glory of
MALEBRANCHE is confined to his own nation, and to
his own age. And ADDISON, perhaps, will be read
with pleasure, when LOCKE shall be intirely for∣gotten.</P>
<P>THE
mere philosopher is a character which is
commonly but little acceptable in the world, as being
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
supposed to contribute nothing either to the advan∣tage
or pleasure of society; while he lives remote
from communication with mankind, and is wrapped
up in principles and notions equally remote from
their comprehension. On the other hand, the mere
ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing
deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age
and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be in∣tirely
void of all relish for those noble entertainments.
The most perfect character is supposed to lie between
those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste
for books, company, and business; preserving in con∣versation
that discernment and delicacy which arise
from polite letters; and in business, that probity and
accuracy which are the natural result of a just philo∣sophy.
In order to diffuse and cultivate so accom∣plished
a character, nothing can be more useful than
compositions of the easy style and manner, which draw
not too much from life, require no deep application
or retreat to be comprehended, and send back the stu∣dent
among mankind full of noble sentiments and
wise precepts, applicable to every exigence of human
life. By means of such compositions, virtue becomes
amiable, science agreeable, company instructive, and
retirement entertaining.</P>
<P>MAN is a reasonable being; and as such, receives
from science his proper food and nourishment: But so
narrow are the bounds of human understanding, that
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
little satisfaction can be hoped for in this particular?
either from the extent or security of his acquisitions.
Man is a sociable, no less than a reasonable being:
But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable
and amusing, or preserve the proper relish of them.
Man is also an active being; and from that dispo∣sition,
as well as from the various necessities of hu∣man
life, must submit to business and occupation:
But the mind requires some relaxation, and cannot
always support its bent to care and industry. It
seems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind
of life as most suitable to human race, and secretly ad∣monished
them to allow none of these biasses to <HI>draw</HI>
too much, so as to incapacitate them for other occu∣pations
and entertainments. Indulge your passion
for science, says she, but let your science be human,
and such as may have a direct reference to action and
society. Abstruse thought and profound researches I
prohibit, and will severely punish, by the pensive me∣lancholy
which they introduce, by the endless uncer∣tainty
in which they involve you, and by the cold re∣ception
which your pretended discoveries will meet
with, when communicated. Be a philosopher; but,
amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.</P>
<P>WERE the generality of mankind contented to pre∣fer
the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound,
without throwing any blame or contempt on the lat∣ter,
it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
with this general opinion, and allow every man to
enjoy, without opposition, his own taste and senti∣ment.
But as the matter is often carried farther,
even to the absolute rejecting all profound reasonings,
or what is commonly called <HI>metaphysics,</HI> we shall now
proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in
their behalf.</P>
<P>WE may begin with observing, that one consider∣able
advantage which results from the accurate and ab∣stract
philosophy, is, its subserviency to the easy and
humane; which, without the former, can never attain
a sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, pre∣cepts,
or reasonings. All polite letters are nothing
but pictures of human life in various attitudes and si∣tuations;
and inspire us with different sentiments, of
praise or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to
the qualities of the object which they set before us.
An artist must be better qualified to succeed in this
undertaking, who, besides a delicate taste and a quick
apprehension, possesses an accurate knowledge of the
internal fabric, the operations of the understanding,
the workings of the passions, and the various species
of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue. How∣ever
painful this inward search or inquiry may appear,
it becomes, in some measure, requisite to those, who
would describe with success the obvious and outward
appearances of life and manners. The anatomist pre∣sents
to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable ob∣jects;
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
but his science is highly useful to the painter in
delineating even a VENUS or an HELEN. While
the latter employs all the richest colours of his art,
and gives his figures the most graceful and engaging
airs; he must still carry his attention to the inward
structure of the human body, the position of the mus∣cles,
the fabric of the bones, and the use and figure of
every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every case, ad∣vantageous
to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate
sentiments. In vain would we exalt the one by de∣preciating
the other.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we may observe, in every art or profes∣sion,
even those which most concern life or action,
that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all
of them nearer their perfection, and renders them
more subservient to the interests of society. And tho'
a philosopher may live remote from business, the ge∣nius
of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several,
must gradually diffuse itself thro' the whole society,
and bestow a similar correctness on every art and call∣ing.
The politician will acquire greater foresight
and subtilty, in the subdividing and balancing of
power; the lawyer more method and finer principles
in his reasonings; and the general more regularity in
his discipline, and more caution in his plans and ope∣ration.
The stability of modern governments above
the antient, and the accuracy of modern philosophy,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
have improved, and probably will still improve, by
similar gradations.</P>
<P>WERE there no advantage to be reaped from these
studies, beyond the gratification of an innocent curi∣osity,
yet ought not even this to be despised; as being
one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures
which are bestowed on human race. The sweetest
and most inoffensive path of life leads thro' the ave∣nues
of science and learning; and whoever can either
remove any obstructions in this way, or open up any
new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a benefac∣tor
to mankind. And tho' these researches may ap∣pear
painful and fatiguing, 'tis with some minds as
with some bodies, which being endowed with vigorous
and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a
pleasure from what, to the generality of mankind, may
seem burdensome and laborious. Obscurity, indeed,
is painful to the mind as well as to the eye; but to
bring light from obscurity, by whatever labour, must
needs be delightful and rejoicing.</P>
<P>BUT this obscurity, in the profound and abstract
philosophy, is objected to, not only as painful and
fatiguing, but as the inevitable source of uncertainty
and error. Here indeed lies the justest and most plau∣sible
objection against a considerable part of meta∣physics,
that they are not properly a science, but arise ei∣ther
from the fruitless efforts of human vanity, which
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to
the understanding, or from the craft of popular super∣stition,
which, being unable to defend themselves on
fair ground, raise these intangling brambles to cover
and protect their weakness. Chaced from the open
country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie in
wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the
mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and pre∣judices.
The stoutest antagonist, if he remits his
watch a moment, is oppressed. And many, thro'
cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies,
and willingly receive them with reverence and sub∣mission,
as their legal sovereigns.</P>
<P>BUT is this a just cause why philosophers should de∣sist
from such researches, and leave superstition still in
possession of her retreat? Is it not reasonable to draw a
direct contrary conclusion, and perceive the necessity
of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the
enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from fre∣quent
disappointments, will at laft abandon such airy
sciences, and discover the proper province of human
reason. For, besides that many persons find too sen∣sible
an interest in perpetually recalling such topics;
besides this, I say, the motive of blind despair can ne∣ver
reasonably have place in the sciences; since, how∣ever
unsuccessful former attempts may have proved,
there is still room to hope, that the industry, good
fortune, or improved sagacity of succeeding genera∣tions
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
may reach discoveries unknown to former ages.
Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous
prize, and find himself stimulated, rather than discou∣raged,
by the failures of his predecessors; while he
hopes, that the glory of atchieving so hard an adven∣ture
is reserved for him alone. The only method of
freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse questions,
is to inquire seriously into the nature of human under∣standing,
and shew, from an exact analysis of its
powers and capacity, that it is by no means sitted for
such remote and abstruse subjects. We must submit
to this fatigue, in order to live at ease for ever after:
And must cultivate true metaphysics with some care,
in order to destroy the false and adulterate. Indolence,
which to some persons, affords a safeguard against this
deceitful philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced by
curiosity; and despair, which, at some moments, pre∣vails,
may give place afterwards to sanguine hopes
and expectations. Accurate and just reasoning is the
only catholic remedy, sitted for all persons and all
dispositions, and is alone able to subvert that abstruse
philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which being
mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a
manner impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives
it the air of science and wisdom.</P>
<P>BESIDES this advantage of rejecting, after deli∣berate
inquiry, the most uncertain and disagreeable
part of learning, there are many positive advantages,
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
which result from an accurate scrutiny into the powers
and saculties of human nature. 'Tis remarkable con∣cerning
the operations of the mind, that tho' most in∣timately
present to us, yet whenever they become the
object of reflection, they seem involved in obscurity,
nor can the eye readily find those lines and bounda∣ries,
which discriminate and distinguish them. The
objects are too fine to remain long in the same aspect
or situation; and must be apprehended, in an in∣stant,
by a superior penetration, derived from nature,
and improved by habit and reflection. It becomes,
therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely to
know the different operations of the mind, to separate
them from each other, to class them under their pro∣per
divisions, and to correct all that seeming disorder,
in which they lie involved, when made the object of
reflection and inquiry. This task of ordering and
distinguishing, which has no merit, when performed
with regard to external bodies, the objects of our sen∣ses,
rises in its value, when directed towards the ope∣rations
of the mind, in proportion to the difficulty and
labour which we meet with in performing it. And if
we can go no farther than this mental geography, or
delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the
mind, 'tis at least a satisfaction to go so far; and the
more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no
means obvious) the more contemptible still must the
ignorance of it be esteemed in all pretenders to learn∣ing
and philosophy.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>
NOR can there remain any suspicion, that this sci∣ence
is uncertain and chimerical; unless we should en∣tertain
such a scepticism as is intirely subversive of all
speculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted,
that the mind is endowed with several powers and fa∣culties,
that these powers are totally distinct from each
other, that what is really distinct to the immediate per∣ception
may be distinguished by reflection; and con∣sequently,
that there is a truth and falshood in all pro∣positions
on this subject, and a truth and falshood,
which lie not beyond the compass of human under∣standing.
There are many obvious distinctions of
this kind, such as those between the will and under∣standing,
the imagination and passions, which fall
within the comprehension of every human creature;
and the finer and more philosophical distinctions are no
less real and certain, tho' more difficult to be com∣prehended.
Some instances, especially late ones, of
success in these inquiries, may give us a juster notion
of the certainty and solidity of this branch of learning.
And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philo∣sopher
to give us a true system of the planets, and ad∣just
the position and order of those remote bodies;
while we affect to overlook those, who, with so much
success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we
are so intimately concerned?</P>
<P>BUT may we not hope, that philosophy, if culti∣vated
with care, and encouraged by the attention of
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
the public, may carry its researches still farther, and
discover, at least in some degree, the secret springs and
principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its
operations? Astronomers had long contented them∣selves
with proving, from the phaenomena, the true
motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies:
Till a philosopher, at last, arose, who seems from the
happiest reasoning, to have also determined the laws
and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are
governed and directed. The like has been performed
with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no
reason to despair of equal success in our inquiries con∣cerning
the mental powers and oeconomy, if prosecu∣red
with equal capacity and caution. 'Tis probable,
that one operation and principle of the mind depends
on another; which, again, may be resolved into one
more general and universal: And how far these re∣searches
may possibly be carried, it will be difficult for
us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to de∣termine.
This is certain, that attempts of this kind
are every day made even by those who philosophize
the most negligently: and nothing can be more re∣quisite
than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough
care and attention; that, if it lie within the compase
of human understanding, it may at last be happily at∣chieved;
if not, it may, however, be rejected with
some confidence and security. This last conclusion'
surrely, is not desireable, nor ought it to be embraced
too rashly. For how much must we diminish from
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
the beauty and value of this species of philosophy, up∣on
such a supposition? Moralists have hitherto been
accustomed, when they considered the vast multitude
and diversity of actions that excite our approbation or
dislike, to search for some common principle, on which
this variety of sentiments might depend. And tho'
they have sometimes carried the matter too far, by
their passion for some one general principle; it must,
however, be confessed, that they are excusable, in ex∣pecting
to find some general principles, into which
all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved.
The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians,
and even politicians: Nor have their attempts been
wholly unsuccessful; tho' perhaps longer time, great∣er
accuracy, and more ardent application may bring
these sciences still nearer their perfection. To throw
up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be
deemed more rash, precipitate, and dogmatical, than
even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy,
which has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates
and principles on mankind.</P>
<P>WHAT tho' these reasonings concerning human na∣ture
seem abstract, and of difficult comprehension?
This affords no presumption of their falshood. On
the contrary, it seems impossible, that what has hi∣therto
escaped so many wise and profound philoso∣phers
can be very obvious and easy. And whatever
pains these researches may cost us, we may think our∣selves
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
sufficiently rewarded, not only in point of pro∣fit
but of pleasure, if, by that means, we can make
any addition to our stock of knowledge, in subjects
of such unspeakable importance.</P>
<P>BUT as, after all, the abstractedness of these specu∣lations
is no recommendation, but rather a disadvan∣tage
to them, and as this difficulty may perhaps be
surmounted by care and art, and the avoiding all un∣necessary
detail, we have, in the following inquiry,
attempted to throw some light upon subjects, from
which uncertainty has hitherto deterred the wise, and
obscurity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite the
boundaries of the different species of philosophy, by
reconciling profound inquiry with clearness, and truth
with novelty! And still more happy, if, reasoning in
this easy manner, we can undermine the foundations
of an abstruse philosophy, which seems to have served
hitherto only as a shelter to supersition, and a cover to
absurdity and error!</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ORIGIN of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one will readily allow, that there is a
considerable difference between the perceptions
of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive
heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when
he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or
anticipates it by his imagination. These faculties
may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses; but
they never can reach entirely the force and vivacity of
the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them,
even when they operate with greatest vigour, is,
that they represent their object in so lively a man∣ner,
that we could <HI>almost</HI> say we feel or see it: But
except the mind be disordered by disease or madness,
they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity, as
to render these perceptions altogether undistinguish∣able.
All the colours of poetry, however splendid,
can never paint natural objects in such a manner as
to make the description be taken for a real landskip.
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest
sensation.</P>
<P>WE may observe a like distinction to run thro' all
the other perceptions of the mind. A man, in a fit
of anger, is actuated in a very different manner from
one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell
me, that any person is in love, I easily understand
your meaning, and form a just conception of his situ∣ation;
but never can mistake that conception for the
real disorders and agitations of the passion. When
we refiect on our paft sentiments and affections, our
thought is a faithful mirror, and copies its objects
truly; but the colours which it employs are faint and
dull, in comparison of those in which our original
perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice dis∣cernment
nor metaphysical head to mark the distinc∣tion
between them.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may divide all the perceptions
of the mind into two classes or species, which are
distinguished by their different degrees of force and
vivacity. The less forcible and lively are commonly
denominated THOUGHTS or IDEAS. The other spe∣cies
want a name in our language, and in most others;
I suppose, because it was not requisite for any, but
philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general
term or appellation. Let us, therefore, use a little
freedom, and call them IMPRESSIONS; employing
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual.
By the term <HI>impression,</HI> then, I mean all our more
lively perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or
love, or hate, or desire, or will. And impressions
are distinguished from ideas, which are the less lively
perceptions of which we are conscious, when we re∣flect
on any of those sensations or movements above
mentioned.</P>
<P>NOTHING, at first view, may seem more unbounded
than the thought of man, which not only escapes all
human power and authority, but is not even restrained
within the limits of nature and reality. To form
monsters, and join incongruous shapes and appear∣ances,
costs no more trouble than to conceive the
most natural and familiar objects. And while the
body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps
with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an in∣stant
transport us into the most distant regions of the
universe; or even beyond the universe, into the un∣bounded
chaos, where nature is supposed to lie in
total confusion. What never was seen, nor heard of,
may yet be conceived; nor is any thing beyond the
power of thought, except what implies an absolute
contradiction.</P>
<P>BUT tho' thought seems to possess this unbounded
liberty, we shall find, upon a nearer examination,
that it is really confined within very narrow limits,
and that all this creative power of the mind amounts
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
to no more than the compounding, transposing, aug∣menting,
or diminishing the materials afforded us by
the senses and experience. When we think of a
golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas,
<HI>gold,</HI> and <HI>mountain,</HI> with which we were formerly ac∣quainted.
A virtuous horse we can conceive; be∣cause,
from our own feeling, we can conceive virtue,
and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a
horse, which is an animal familiar to us. In short,
all the materials of thinking are derived either from
our outward or inward sentiment: The mixture and
composition of these belongs alone to the mind and
will. Or, to express myself in philosophical lan∣guage,
all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are
copies of our impressions or more lively ones.</P>
<P>To prove this, the two following arguments will,
I hope, be sufficient. First, When we analyse our
thoughts or ideas, however compounded or sublime,
we always find, that they resolve themselves into such
simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling
or sentiment. Even those ideas, which, at first view,
seem the most wide of this origin, are found, upon
a narrower scrutiny, to be derived from it. The idea
of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise,
and good Being, arises from reflecting on the opera∣tions
of our own mind, and augmenting, without li∣mit,
those qualities of goodness and wisdom. We
may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please;
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
where we shall always find, that every idea we exa∣mine
is copied from a similar impression. Those who
would assert, that this position is not absolutely uni∣versal
and without exception, have only one, and that
an easy method of refuting it; by producing that idea,
which, in their opinion, is not derived from this
source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would
maintain our doctrine, to produce the impression or
lively perception, which corresponds to it.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If it happen, from a defect of the
organ, that a man is not susceptible of any species
of sensation, we always find, that he is as little sus∣ceptible
of the correspondent ideas. A blind man
can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds.
Restore either of them that sense, in which he is de∣ficient;
by opening this new inlet for his sensations,
you also open an inlet for the ideas, and he finds no
difficulty of conceiving these objects. The case is the
fame, if the object, proper for exciting any sensation,
has never been applied to the organ. A LAPLANDER
or NEGROE has no notion of the relish of wine.
And tho' there are few or no instances of a like defi∣ciency
in the mind, where a person has never felt or
is wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion, that be∣longs
to his species; yet we find the same observation
to take place in a less degree. A man of mild man∣ners
can form no notion of inveterate revenge or
cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
heights of friendship and generosity. 'Tis readily al∣lowed,
that other beings may possess many senses, of
which we can have no conception: because the ideas
of them have never been introduced to us in the only
manner by which an idea can have access to the mind,
<HI>viz.</HI> by the actual feeling and sensation.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one contradictory phaenome∣non,
which may prove, that 'tis not absolutely im∣possible
for ideas to go before their correspondent im∣pressions.
I believe it will readily be allowed, that
the several distinct ideas of colours, which enter by
the eyes, or those of sounds, which are conveyed by
the hearing, are really different from each other; tho',
at the same time, resembling. Now if this be true
of different colours, it must be no less so, of the dif∣ferent
shades of the same colour; and each shade pro∣duces
a distinct idea, independent of the rest. For if
this should be denied, 'tis possible, by the continual
gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into
what is most remote from it; and if you will not al∣low
any of the means to be different, you cannot,
without absurdity, deny the extremes to be the same.
Suppose, therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight
for thirty years, and to have become perfectly well
acquainted with colours of all kinds, except one par∣ticular
shade of blue, for instance, which it never has
been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different
shades of that colour, except that single one, be
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
placed before him, descending gradually from the
deepest to the lightest; 'tis plain, that he will per∣ceive
a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will
be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that
place betwixt the contiguous colours than in any other. Now
I ask, whether 'tis possible for him, from his own
imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up
to himself the idea of that particular shade, tho' it
had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I
believe there are few but will be of opinion that he
can; and this may serve as a proof, that the simple
ideas are not always, in every instance, derived from
the correspondent impressions; tho' this instance is
so singular, that 'tis scarce worth our observing, and
does not merit, that for it alone, we should alter our
general maxim.</P>
<P>HERE, therefore, is a proposition, which not only
seems, in itself, simple and intelligible; but if a pro∣per
use were made of it, might render every dispute
equally intelligible, and banish all that jargon, which
has so long taken possession of metaphysical reason∣ings,
and drawn such disgrace upon them. All ideas,
especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and ob∣scure;
the mind has but a slender hold of them:
They are apt to be confounded with other resembling
ideas; and when we have often employed any term,
tho' without a distinct meaning, we are apt to ima∣gine
that it has a determinate idea, annexed to it.
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
On the contrary, all impressions, that is, all sensations,
either outward or inward, are strong and sensible:
The limits between them are more exactly deter∣mined:
Nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake
with regard to them. When we entertain therefore
any suspicion, that a philosophical term is employed
without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent)
we need but enquire, <HI>from what impression is that
supposed idea derived?</HI> And if it be impossible to as∣sign
any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.
By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may rea∣sonably
hope to remove all dispute, which may arise,
concerning their nature and reality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Tis probable, that no more was meant by those, who de∣nied innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our impres∣sions; tho' it must be confessed, that the terms which they em∣ployed were not chosen with such caution, nor so exactly defined as to prevent all mistakes about their doctrine. For what is meant by <HI>innate?</HI> If innate be equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allowed to be in∣nate or natural, in whatever sense we take the latter word, whether in opposition to what is uncommon, artificial, or mira∣culous. If by innate be meant, cotemporary to our birth, the dispute seems to be frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins, whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word, <HI>idea,</HI> seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense, even by Mr. LOCKE himself, as standing for any of our perceptions, our sensations and passions, as well as thoughts. Now in this sense, I should desire to know, what can be meant by asserting, that self-love, or resentment of injuries, or the passion between the sexes is, not innate?</P>
<P>But admitting these terms, <HI>impressions</HI> and <HI>ideas,</HI> in the sense above explained, and understanding by <HI>innate</HI> what is original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we assert, that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas not innate.</P>
<P>To be ingenuous, I must own it to be my opinion, that Mr. LOCKE was betrayed into this question by the schoolmen, who making use of undefined terms, draw out their disputes to a te∣dious length, without ever touching the point in question. A like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run thro' all that great philosopher's reasonings on this subject.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ASSOCIATION of IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS evident, that there is a principle of con∣nexion
between the different thoughts or ideas
of the mind, and that in their appearance to the me∣mory
or imagination, they introduce each other with
a certain degree of method and regularity. In our
more serious thinking or discourse, this is so observ∣able,
that any particular thought, which breaks in
upon this regular tract or chain of ideas, is immedi∣ately
remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest
and most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams,
we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran
not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a
connexion upheld among the different ideas, which
succeeded each other. Were the loosest and freest
conversation to be transcribed, there would immedi∣ately
be observed something, which connected it in
all its transitions. Or where this is wanting, the per∣son,
who broke the thread of discourse, might still
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
inform you, that there had secretly revolved in his
mind a succession of thought, which had gradually led
him away from the subject of conversation. Among
the languages of different nations, even where we
cannot suspect the least connexion or communication,
'tis found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the
most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each
other: A certain proof, that the simple ideas, com∣prehended
in the compound ones, were bound toge∣ther
by some universal principle, which had an equal
influence on all mankind.</P>
<P>THO' it be too obvious to escape observation, that
different ideas are connected together; I do not find,
that any philosopher has attempted to enumerate or
class all the principles of association; a subject, how∣ever,
that seems very worthy of curiosity. To me,
there appear to be only three principles of connexion
among ideas, <HI>viz. Resemblance, Contiguity</HI> in time or
place, and <HI>Cause</HI> or <HI>Effect.</HI></P>
<P>THAT these principles serve to connect ideas will
not, I believe, be much doubted. A picture natu∣rally
leads our thoughts to the original<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Resemblance.</NOTE>: The men∣tion
of one apartment in a building naturally intro∣duces
an enquiry or discourse concerning the others<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Contiguity.</NOTE>:
And if we think of a wound, we can scarce forbear
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
reflecting on the pain which follows it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cause and Effect.</NOTE>. But that
this enumeration is compleat, and that there are no
other principles of association, except these, may be
difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader, or
even to a man's own satisfaction. All we can do, in
such cases, is to run over several instances, and exa∣mine
carefully the principle, which binds the different
thoughts to each other, never stopping till we render
the principle as general as possible. The more in∣stances
we examine, and the more care we employ,
the more assurance shall we acquire, that the enume∣ration,
which we form from the whole, is compleat
and entire. Instead of entering into a detail of this
kind, which would lead into many useless subtilties,
we shall consider some of the effects of this connexion
upon the passions and imagination; where we may
open a field of speculation more entertaining, and per∣haps
more instructive, than the other.</P>
<P>As man is reasonable being, and is continually in
pursuit of happiness, which he hopes to attain by
the gratification of some passion or affection, he sel∣dom
acts or speaks or thinks without a purpose and
intention. He has still some object in view; and
however improper the means may sometimes be,
which he chuses for the attainment of his end, he
never loses view of an end, nor will he so much as
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
throw away his thoughts or reflections, where he hopes
not to reap any satisfaction from them.</P>
<P>IN all compositions of genius, therefore, 'tis requi∣site
that the writer have some plan or object; and
tho' he may be hurried from this plan by the vehe∣mence
of thought, as in an ode, or drop it carelesly,
as in an epistle or essay, there must appear some aim
or intention, in his first setting out, if not in the
composition of the whole work. A production with∣out
a design would resemble more the raving of a
madman, than the sober efforts of genius and learn∣ing.</P>
<P>As
this rule admits of no exception, it follows,
that in narrative compositions, the events or actions,
which the writer relates, must be connected together,
by some bond or tye: They must be related to each
other in the imagination, and form a kind of <HI>Unity,</HI>
which may bring them under one plan or view, and
which may be the object or end of the writer in his
first undertaking.</P>
<P>THIS connecting principle among the several events,
which form the subject of a poem or history, may by
very different, according to the different designs of
the poet or historian. OVID has formed his plan up∣on
the connecting principle or resemblance. Every
sabulous transformation, produced by the miraculous
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
power of the gods, falls within the compass of his
work. There needs but this one circumstance in any
event to bring it under his original plan or intention.</P>
<P>AN annalist or historian, who should undertake to
write the history of EUROPE during any century,
would be influenced by the connexion of contiguity
in time and place. All events, which happen in that
portion of space, and period of time, are compre∣hended
in his design, tho' in other respects different
and unconnected. They have still a species of unity,
amidst all their diversity.</P>
<P>BUT the most usual species of connexion among
the different events, which enter into any narrative
composition, is that of cause and effect: while the
historian traces the series of actions according to their
natural order, remounts to their secret springs and
principles, and delineates their most remote conse∣quences.
He chuses for his subject a certain portion
of that great chain of events, which compose the his∣tory
of mankind: Each link in this chain he endea∣vours
to touch in his narration: Sometimes unavoid∣able
ignorance renders all his attempts fruitless: Some∣times,
he supplies by conjecture what is wanting in
knowledge: And always, he is sensible, that the more
unbroken the chain is, which he presents to his read∣ers,
the more perfect is his production. He sees,
that the knowledge of causes is not only the most sa∣tisfactory;
this relation or connexion being the strong∣est
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
of all others; but also the most instructive; since
it is by this knowlege alone, we are enabled to con∣troul
events, and govern futurity.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may attain some notion of that
<HI>Unity</HI> of <HI>Action,</HI> about which all critics, after ARI∣STOTLE,
have talked so much: Perhaps, to little
purpose, while they directed not their taste or senti∣ment
by the accuracy of philosophy. It appears,
that in all productions, as well as in the epic and
tragic, there is a certain unity required, and that, on
no occasion, can our thoughts be allowed to run at
adventures, if we would produce a work, which will
give any lasting entertainment to mankind. It ap∣pears
also, that even a biographer, who should write
the life of ACHILLES, would connect the events, by
shewing their mutual dependence and relation, as
much as a poet, who should make the anger of that
hero, the subject of his narration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contrary to ARISTOTLE, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. Not only in any
limited portion of life, a man's actions have a depen∣dance
on each other, but also during the whole pe∣riod
of his duration, from the cradle to the grave;
nor is it possible to strike off one link, however mi∣nute,
in this regular chain, without affecting the
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
whole series of events, which follow. The unity of
action, therefore, which is to be found in biography
or history, differs from that of epic poetry, not in
kind, but in degree. In epic poetry, the connexion
among the events is more close and sensible: The
narration is not carried on thro' such a length of
time: And the actors hasten to some remarkable pe∣riod,
which satisfies the curiosity of the reader. This
conduct of the epic poet depends on that particular
situation of the <HI>Imagination</HI> and of the <HI>Passions,</HI> which
is supposed in that production. The imagination,
both of writer and reader, is more enlivened, and the
passions more enflamed than in history, biography,
or any species of narration, which confine themselves
to strict truth and reality. Let us consider the effect
of these two circumstances, an enlivened imagination
and enflamed passions, circumstances, which belong
to poetry, especially the epic kind, above any other
species of composition; and let us examine the reason
why they require a stricter and closer unity in the
fable.</P>
<P>FIRST. All poetry, being a species of painting,
approaches us nearer to the objects than any other
species of narration, throws a stronger light upon
them, and delineates more distinctly those minute
circumstances, which, tho' to the historian they seem
supersluous, serve mightily to enliven the imagery,
and gratify the fancy. If it be not necessary, as in
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
the <HI>Iliad,</HI> to inform us each time the hero buckles his
shoes, and ties his garters, it will be requisite, per∣haps,
to enter into a greater detail than in the HEN∣RIADE;
where the events are run over with such ra∣pidity,
that we scarce have leisure to become acquaint∣ed
with the scene or action. Were a poet, therefore,
to comprehend in his subject any great compass of
time or series of events, and trace up the death of
HECTOR to its remote causes, in the rape of HELEN,
or the judgment of PARIS, he must draw out his
poem to an immeasurable length, in order to fill this
large canvas with just painting and imagery. The
reader's imagination, enflamed with such a series of
poetical descriptions, and his passions, agitated by a
continual sympathy with the actors, must flag long
before the period of the narration, and must sink into
lassitude and disgust, from the repeated violence of
the same movements.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. That an epic poet must not trace the
causes to any great distance, will farther appear, if
we consider another reason, which is drawn from a
property of the passions still more remarkable and sin∣gular.
'Tis evident, that in a just composition, all
the affections, excited by the different events, described
and represented, add mutual force to each other; and
that while the heroes are all engaged in one common
scene, and each action is strongly connected with the
whole, the concern is continually awake, and the pass∣ions
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
make an easy transition from one object to ano∣ther.
The strong connection of the events, as it fa∣cilitates
the passage of the thought or imagination
from one to another, facilitates also the transfusion of
the passions, and preserves the affections still in the
same channel and direction. Our sympathy and con∣cern
for EVE prepares the way for a like sympathy
with ADAM: The affection is preserved almost entire
in the transition; and the mind seizes immediately
the new object as strongly related to that which for∣merly
engaged its attention. But were the poet to
make a total digression from his subject, and intro∣duce
a new actor, no way connected with the per∣sonages,
the imagination, feeling a breach in the tran∣sition,
would enter coldly into the new scene; would
kindle by flow degrees; and in returning to the main
subject of the poem, would pass, as it were, upon
foreign ground, and have its concern to excite anew,
in order to take party with the principal actors. The
same inconvenience follows in a less degree, where
the poet traces his events to too great a distance, and
binds together actions, which tho' not entirely dis∣joined,
have not so strong a connexion as is requisite
to forward the transition of the passions. Hence arises
the artifice of the oblique narration, employed in the
<HI>Odyssey</HI> AND <HI>Aeneid;</HI> where the hero is introduced, at
first, near the period of his designs, and afterwards
shows us, as it were in perspective, the more distant
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
events and causes. By this means, the reader's curi∣osity
is immediately excited: The events follow with
rapidity, and in a very close connexion: And the
concern is preserved alive, and, by means of the near
relation of the objects, continually increases, from the
beginning to the end of the narration.</P>
<P>THE same rule takes place in dramatic poetry;
nor is it ever permitted, in a regular composition, to
introduce an actor, who has no connexion, or but a
small one, with the principal personages of the fable.
The spectator's concern must not be diverted by any
scenes, disjoined and separated from the rest. This
breaks the course of the passions, and prevents that
communication of the several emotions, by which one
scene adds force to another, and transfuses the pity
and terror, which it excites, upon each succeeding
scene, 'till the whole produces that rapidity of move∣ment,
which is peculiar to the theatre. How must
it extinguish this warmth of affection to be enter∣tained,
on a sudden, with a new action and new per∣sonages,
no way related to the former; to find so
sensible a breach or vacuity in the course of the pas∣sions,
by means of this breach in the connexion of
ideas; and instead of carrying the sympathy of one
scene into the following, to be obliged every moment,
to excite a new concern, and take party in a new
scene of action?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41"/>
BUT tho' this rule of unity of action be common
to dramatic and epic poetry; we may still observe a
difference between them, which may, perhaps, de∣serve
our attention. In both these species of compo∣sition,
'tis requisite that the action be one and simple,
in order to preserve the concern or sympathy entire
and undiverted: But in epic or narrative poetry, this
rule is also established upon another foundation, <HI>viz.</HI>
the necessity, that is incumbent on every writer, to
form some plan or design, before he enter on any
discourse or narration, and to comprehend his subject
in some general aspect or united view, which may
be the constant object of his attention. As the author
is entirely lost in dramatic compositions, and the spec∣tator
supposes himself to be really present at the ac∣tions
represented; this reason has no place with re∣gard
to the stage; but any dialogue or conversation
may be introduced, which, without improbability,
might have passed in that determinate portion of space,
represented by the theatre. Hence in all our ENG∣LISH
comedies, even those of CONGREVE, the unity
of action is never strictly observed; but the poet
thinks is sufficient, if his personages be any way re∣lated
to each other, by blood, or by living in the
same family; and he afterwards introduces them in
particular scenes, where they display their humours and
characters, without much forwarding the main action.
The double plots of TERENCE are licences of the
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
same kind; but in a less degree. And tho' this con∣duct
be not perfectly regular, it is not wholly unsuit∣able
to the nature of comedy, where the movements
and passions are not raised to such a height as in tra∣gedy;
at the same time, that the fiction or represen∣tation
palliates, in some measure, such licences. In
a narrative poem, the first proposition or design con∣fines
the author to one subject; and any digressions
of this nature would, at first view, be rejected, as
absurd and monstrous. Neither BOCCACE, LA FON∣TAINE,
nor any author of that kind, tho' pleasantry
be their chief object, have ever indulged them.</P>
<P>To return to the comparison of history and epic
poetry, we may conclude, from the foregoing rea∣sonings,
that as a certain unity is requisite in all pro∣ductions,
it cannot be wanting to history more than
to any other; that in history, the connexion among
the several events, which unites them into one body,
is the relation of cause and effect, the same which
takes place in epic poetry; and that in the latter com∣position,
this connexion is only required to be closer
and more sensible, on account of the lively imagina∣tion
and strong passions, which must be touched by
the poet in his narration. The PELEPONNESIAN
war is a proper subject for history, the siege of
ATHENS for an epic poem, and the death of ALCI∣BIADES
for a tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/>
As the difference, therefore, between history and
epic poetry consists only in the degrees of connexion,
which bind together those several events, of which
their subject is composed, 'twill be difficult, if not
impossible, by words, to determine exactly the bounds
which separate them from each other. That is a
matter of taste more than of reasoning; and perhaps,
this unity may often be discovered in a subject, where,
at first view, and from an abstract consideration, we
should least expect to find it.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that HOMER, in the course of his
narration, exceeds the first proposition of his subject;
and that the anger of ACHILLES, which caused the
death of HECTOR, is not the same with that which
produced so many ills to the GREEKS. But the strong
connexion between those two movements, the quick
transition from one to another, the contrast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Contrast of contrariety is a connexion among ideas, which may, perhaps, be considered as a mixture of causation and re∣semblance. Where two objects are contrary, the one destroys the other, i. e. is the cause of its annihilation, and the idea of the annihilation of an object implies the idea of its former ex∣istence.</NOTE> between
the effects of concord and discord among the princes,
and the natural curiosity which we have to see A∣CHILLES
in action, after such long repose; all these
causes carry on the reader, and produce a sufficient
unity in the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="44"/>
IT may be objected to MILTON, that he has traced
up his causes to too great a distance, and that the re∣bellion
of the angles produces the fall of man by a
train of events, which is both very long and very ca∣sual.
Not to mention that the creation of the world,
which he has related at length, is no more the cause
of that catastrophe, than of the battle of PHARSALIA,
or any other event, that has ever happened. But if
we consider, on the other hand, that all these events,
the rebellion of the angels, the creation of the world,
and the fall of man, <HI>resemble</HI> each other, in being
miraculous and out of the common course of nature;
that they are supposed to be <HI>contiguous</HI> in time;
and that being detached from all other events, and
being the only original facts, which revelation dis∣covers,
they strike the eye at once, and naturally re∣call
each other to the thought or imagination: If we
consider all these circumstances, I say, we shall find,
that these parts of the action have a sufficient unity
to make them be comprehended in one fable or nar∣ration.
To which we may add, that the rebellion of
the angels and the fall of man have a peculiar re∣semblance,
as being counterparts to each other, and
presenting to the reader the same moral, of obedi∣ence
to our Creator.</P>
<P>THESE loose hints I have thrown together, in or∣der
to excite the curiosity of philosophers, and beget
a suspicion at least, if not a full persuasion, that this
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
subject is very copious, and that many operations of
the human mind depend on the connexion or associa∣tion
of ideas, which is here explained. Particularly,
the sympathy between the passions and imagination
will, perhaps, appear remarkable; while we observe
that the affections, excited by one object, pass easily
to another connected with it; but transfuse them∣selves
with difficulty, or not at all, along different
objects, which have no manner of connexion toge∣ther.
By introducing, into any composition, per∣sonages
and actions, foreign to each other, an injudi∣cious
author loses that communication of emotions,
by which alone he can interest the heart, and raise
the passions to their proper height and period. The
full explication of this principle and all its conse∣quences
would lead us into reasonings too profound
and too copious for this enquiry. 'Tis sufficient, at
present, to have established this conclusion, that the
three connecting principles of all ideas are the rela∣tions
of <HI>Resemblance, Contiguity,</HI> and <HI>Causation.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">SCEPTICAL DOUBTS concerning the OPE∣RATIONS
of the UNDERSTANDING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the objects of human reason or enquiry may
naturally be divided into two kinds, <HI>viz. Re∣lations
of Ideas</HI> and <HI>Matters of Fact.</HI> Of the first kind
are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arith∣metic;
and in short, every affirmation, which is either
intuitively or demonstratively certain. <HI>That the square
of the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the two sides,</HI>
is a proposition, which expresses a relation between
these figures. <HI>That three times five is equal to the half
of thirty,</HI> expresses a relation between these numbers.
Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere
operation of thought, without dependence on what is
any where existent in the universe. Tho' there never
were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths demon∣strated
by EUCLID, would for ever retain their cer∣tainty
and evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
MATTERS of fact, which are the second objects of
human reason, are not ascertained int the same man∣ner;
nor is our evidence of their truth, however
great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The con∣trary
of every matter of fact is still possible; be∣cause
it can never imply a contradiction, and is con∣ceived
by the mind with equal facility and distinct∣ness,
as if ever so conformable to reality. <HI>That the
sun will not rise to-morrow</HI> is no less intelligible a
proposition, and implies no more contradiction, than
the affirmation, <HI>that it will rise.</HI> We should in vain,
therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falshood. Were
it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradic∣tion,
and could never be distinctly conceived by the
mind.</P>
<P>IT may, therefore, be a subject worthy curiosity,
to enquire what is the nature of that evidence, which
assures us of any real existence and matter of fact,
beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the re∣cords
of our memory. This part of philosophy, 'tis
observable, has been little cultivated, either by the
ancients or moderns; and therefore our doubts and er∣rors,
in the prosecution of so important an enquiry,
may be the more excusable, while we march thro'
such difficult paths, without any guide or direction.
They may even prove useful, by exciting curiosity,
and destroying that implicit faith and security, which
is the bane of all reasoning and free enquiry. The
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
discovery of defects in the common philosophy, if
any such there be, will not, I presume, be a discou∣ragement,
but rather an incitement, as is usual, to
attempt something more full and satisfactory, than
has yet been proposed to the public.</P>
<P>ALL reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to
be founded in the relation of <HI>Cause</HI> and <HI>Effect.</HI> By
means of that relation alone can we go beyond the
evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to
ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which
is absent; for instance, that his friend is in the coun∣try,
or in FRANCE; he would give you a reason;
and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter
received from him, or the knowlege of his former
resolutions and primises. A man, finding a watch
or any other machine in a desart island, would con∣clude,
that there had once been men in that island.
All our reasonings concerning fact are of the same
nature. And here 'tis constantly supposed, that there
is a connexion between the present fact and that in∣ferred
from it. Were there nothing to bind them to∣gether,
the inference would be entirely precarious.
The hearing of an articulate voice and rational dis∣course
in the dark assures us of the presence of some
person: Why? because these are the effects of the
human make and fabric, and closely connected with
it. If we anatomize all the other reasonings of this
nature, we shall find, that they are founded in the
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
relation of cause and effect, and that this relation is
either near or remote, direct or collateral. Heat and
light are collateral effects of fire, and the one effect
may justly be inferred from the other.</P>
<P>IF we would satisfy ourselves, therefore, concern∣ing
the nature of that evidence, which assures us of
all matters of fact, we must enquire how we arrive at
the knowlege of cause and effect.</P>
<P>I SHALL venture to affirm, as a general proposition,
which admits of no exception, that the knowlege of this
relation is not, in any instance, attained by reasonings
<HI>à priori;</HI> but arises entirely from experience, when we
find, that any particular objects are constantly con∣joined
with each other. Let an object be presented
to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities;
if that object be entirely new to him, he will not be
able, by the most accurate examination of its sensible
qualities, to discover any of its causes or effects.
ADAM, tho' his rational faculties be supposed, at the
very first, entirely perfect, could not have inferred
from the fluidity and transparency of water, that it
would suffocate him, or from the light and warmth of
fire, that it would consume him. No object ever dis∣covers,
by the qualities which appear to the senses,
either the causes, which produced it, or the effects,
which will arise from it; nor can our reason, unas∣sisted
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
by experience, ever draw any inferences con∣cerning
real existence and matter of fact.</P>
<P>THIS proposition, <HI>that cause and effects are discover∣able,
not by reason but by experience,</HI> will readily be
admitted with regard to such objects, as we remem∣ber
to have been once altogether unknown to us;
since we must be conscious of the utter inability which
we then lay under of foretelling what would arise
from them. Present two smooth pieces of marble to
a man, who has no tincture of natural philosophy;
he will never discover, that they will adhere together,
in such a manner as to require great force to separate
them in a direct line, while they make so small a re∣sistance
to a lateral pressure. Such events, as bear
little analogy to the common course of nature, are also
readily confessed to be known only by experience; nor
does any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder,
or the attraction of a loadstone could ever be disco∣vered
by arguments <HI>à priori.</HI> In like manner, when
an effect is supposed to depend upon an intricate ma∣chinery
or secret structure of parts, we make no dif∣ficulty
to attribute all our knowlege of it to experi∣ence.
Who will assert, that he can give the ultimate
reason, why milk or bread is proper nourishment for
a man, not for a lion or a tyger?</P>
<P>BUT the same truth may not appear, at first sight,
to have the same evidence with regard to events,
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
which have become familiar to us from our first ap∣pearance
in the world, which bear a close analogy to
the whole course of nature, and which are supposed
to depend on the simple qualities of objects, without
any secret structure of parts. We are apt to ima∣gine,
that we could discover these effects, by the mere
operations of our reason, without experience. We
fancy, that, were we brought, on a sudden, into this
world, we could at first have inferred, that one Bil∣liard-ball
would communicate motion to another up∣on
impulse; and that we needed not to have waited
for the event, in order to pronounce with certainty
concerning it. Such is the influence of custom, that,
where it is strongest, it not only covers our natural
ignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems not to
take place, merely because it is found in the highest
degree.</P>
<P>BUT to convince us, that all the laws of nature
and all the operations of bodies, without exception,
are known only by experience, the following reflec∣tions,
may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object pre∣sented
to us, and were we required to pronounce con∣cerning
the effect, which will result from it, without
consulting past observation; after what manner, I be∣seech
you, must the mind proceed in this operation?
It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes
to the object as its effect; and 'tis plain that this
invention must be entirely arbitrary. The mind can
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by
the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the
effect is totally different from the cause, and conse∣quently
can never be discovered in it. Motion in the
second Billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from mo∣tion
in the first; nor is there any thing in the one to
suggest the smallest hint of the other. A stone or
piece of metal raised into the air, and left without
any support, immediately falls: But to consider the
matter <HI>à priori,</HI> is there any thing we discover in this
situation, which can beget the idea of a downward,
rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the
stone or metal?</P>
<P>AND as the first imagination or invention of a par∣ticular
effect, in all natural operations, is arbitrary,
where we consult not experience; so must we also
esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the
cause and effect, which binds them together, and ren∣ders
it impossible, that any other effect could result
from the operatioon of that cause. When I see, for
instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a strait line towards
another; even suppose motion in the second ball
should by accident be suggested to me, as the result
of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive, that
a hundred different events might as well follow from
that cause? May not both these balls remain at abso∣lute
rest? May not the first ball return in a strait line,
or leap off from the second in any line or direction?
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable.
Why then should we give the preference to one,
which is no more consistent nor conceivable than the
rest? All our reasonings <HI>à priori</HI> will never be able
to shew us any foundation for this preference.</P>
<P>IN a word, then, every effect is a distinct event
from its cause. It could not, therefore, be discovered
In the cause, and the first invention or conception of
it, <HI>à priori,</HI> must be entirely arbitrary. And even
after it is suggested, the conjunction of it with the
cause must appear equally arbitrary; since there are
always many other effects, which, to reason, must
seem fully as consistent and natural. In vain, there∣fore,
should we pretend to determine any single event,
or infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of
observation and experience.</P>
<P>HENCE we may discover the reason, why no philo∣sopher,
who is rational and modest, has ever pretended
to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation,
or to show distinctly the action of that power, which
produced any single effect in the universe. 'Tis con∣fessed,
that the utmost effort of human reason is, to
reduce the principles, productive of natural phaeno∣mena,
to a greater simplicity, and to resolve the
many particular effects into a few general cause, by
means of reasonings from analogy, experience, and
observation. But as to the causes of these general
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery;
nor shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves, by any
particular explication of them. These ultimate springs
and principles are totally shut up from human curi∣osity
and enquiry. Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of
parts, communication of motion by impulse; these
are probably the ultimate causes and principles which
we shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem
ourselves sufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry
and reasoning, we can trace up the particular phaeno∣mena
to, or near to, these general principles. The
most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only
staves off our ignorance a little longer: As perhaps
the most perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphy∣sical
kind serves only to discover larger portion of
our ignorance. Thus the observation of human
blindness and weakness is the result of all philosophy,
and meets us, at every turn, in spight of our endea∣vours
to elude or avoid it.</P>
<P>NOR is geometry, when taken into the assistance
of natural philosophy, ever able to remedy this de∣fect,
or lead us into the knowlege of ultimate causes,
by all that accuracy of reasoning, for which it is so
justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics
goes upon the supposition, that certain laws are esta∣blished
by nature in her operations; and abstract rea∣sonings
are employed, either to assist experience in
the discovery of these laws, or to determine their in∣fluence
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
in particular instances, where it depends upon
any precise degrees of distance and quantity. Thus
'tis a law of motion, discovered by experience, that
the moment or force of any body in motion is in the
compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and
its velocity; and consequently, that a small sorce may
remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight,
if by any contrivance or machinery we can encrease
the velocity of that force, so as to make it an over∣match
for its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the
application of this law, by giving us the just di∣mensions
of all the parts and figures, which can enter
into any species of machine; but still the discovery
of the law itself is owing merely to experience, and
all the abstract reasonings in the world could never
lead us one step towards the knowlege of it. When
we reason <HI>à priori,</HI> and consider merely any object or
cause, as it appears to the mind, independent of all
observation, it never could suggest to us the notion
of any distinct object, such as its effect; much less,
shew us the inseparable and inviolable connection be∣tween
them. A man must be very sagacious, who
could discover by reasoning, that crystal is the effect
of heat, and ice of cold, without being previously
acquainted with the operations of these qualities.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>BUT we have not, as yet, attained any tolerable
satisfaction with regard to the question first proposed.
Each solution still gives rise to a new question as dif∣ficult
as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther en∣quiries.
When it is asked, <HI>What is the nature of all
our reasonings concerning matter of fact?</HI> The proper
answer seems to be, that they are founded on the rela∣tion
of cause and effect. When again it is asked,
<HI>What is the foundation of all our reasonings and con∣clusions
concerning that relation?</HI> it may be replied in
one word, EXPERIENCE. But if we still carry on
our sifting humour, and ask, <HI>What is the foundation
of all our conclusions from experience?</HI> this implies a
new question, which may be of more difficult solution
and explication. Philosophers, that give themselves
airs of superior wisdom and sufficiency, have a hard
task, when they encounter persons of inquisitive dis∣positions,
who push them from every corner, to which
they retreat, and who are sure at last to bring them
to some dangerous dilemma. The best expedient to
prevent this confusion, is to be modest in our preten∣sions;
and even to discover the difficulty ourselves
before it is objected to us. By this means, we may
make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57"/>
I SHALL content myself, in this section, with an
easy task, and shall pretend only to give a negative
answer to the question here proposed. I say then,
that even after we have experience of the operations
of cause and effect, our conclusions from that experi∣ence
are <HI>not</HI> founded on reasoning, or any process of
the understanding. This answer we must endeavour,
both to explain and to defend.</P>
<P>IT must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept
us at a great distance from all her secrets, and has
aoffrded us only the knowlege of a few superficial
qualities of objects, while she conceals from us those
powers and principles, on which the influence of these
objects entirely depends. Our senses inform us of
the colour, weight, and consistence of bread; but
neither senses nor reason ever can inform us of those
qualities, which fit it for the nourishment and support
of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea
of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that won∣derful
force or power, which would carry on a mov∣ing
body for ever in a continued change of place,
and which bodies never lose but by communicating it
to others; of this we cannot form the most distant
conception. But notwithanding this ignorance of
natural powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word, Power, is here used in a loose and popular sense. The more accurate explication of it would give additional evi∣dence to this argument. See Sect. 7.</NOTE> and principles, we always presume,
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
where we see like sensible qualities, that they have
like secret powers, and lay our account, that effects,
similar to those, which we have experienced, will
follow from them. If a body of like colour and
consistence with that bread, which we have formerly
eat, be presented to us, we make no scruple of re∣peating
the experiment, and expect, with certainty, like
nourishment and support. Now this is a process of
the mind or thought, of which I would willingly
know the foundation. 'Tis allowed on all hands, that
there is no known connection between the sensible
qualities and the secret powers; and consequently,
that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion
concerning their constant and regular conjunction, by
any thing which it knows of their nature. As to
past <HI>Experience,</HI> it can be allowed to give <HI>direct</HI> and
<HI>certain</HI> information only of those precise objects, and
that precise period of time, which fell under its cogni∣zance:
But why this experience should be extended
to future times, and to other objects, which, for
aught we know, may be only in appearance similar;
this is the main question on which I would insist. The
bread, which I formerly eat, nourished me; that is,
a body of such sensible qualities, was, at that time,
endued with such secret powers: But does it follow,
that other bread must also nourish me at another time,
and that like sensible qualities must always be attended
with like secret powers? The consequence seems no
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
way necessary. At least, it must be acknowleged,
that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind;
that there is a certain step taken; a process of thought,
and an inference, which wants to be explained. These
two propositions are far from being the same, <HI>I have
found that such an object has always been attended with
such an effect,</HI> and <HI>I foresee, that other objects, which
are, to appearance, similar, will be attended with simi∣lar
effects.</HI> I shall allow, if you please, that the one
proposition may justly be inferred from the other: I
know in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you
insist, that the inference is made by a chain of reason∣ing,
I desire you to produce that reasoning. The con∣nection
between these propositions is not intuitive.
There is required a medium, which may enable the
mind to draw such an inference; if indeed it be drawn
by reasoning and argument. What that medium is,
I must confess, passes my comprehension; and 'tis
incumbent on those to produce it, who assert, that it
really exists, and is the origin of all our conclusions
concerning matter of fact.</P>
<P>THIS negative argument must certainly, in process
of time, become altogether convincing, if many pe∣netrating
and able philosophers shall turn their inqui∣ries
this way; and no one be ever able to discover
any connecting proposition or intermediate step, which
supports the understanding in this conclusion. But as
the question is yet new, every reader may not trust so
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
far to his own penetration, as to conclude, because an
argument escapes his research and enquiry, that there∣fore
it does not really exist. For this reason it may
be requisite to venture upon a more difficult task;
and enumerating all the branches of human knowlege,
endeavour to shew, that none of them can afford such
an argument.</P>
<P>ALL reasonings may be divided into two kinds,
<HI>viz.</HI> demonstrative reasonings, or those concerning
relations of ideas, and moral reasonings or those con∣cerning
matter of fact and existence. That there are
no demonstrative arguments in the case, seems evi∣dent;
since it implies no contradiction, that the course
of nature may change, and that an object seemingly
like those which we have experienced, may be at∣tended
with different or contrary effects. May I not
clearly and distinctly conceive, that a body falling
from the clouds, and which, in all other respects,
resembles snow, has yet the taste of salt or feeling of
fire? Is there any more intelligible proposition than
to affirm, that all the trees will flourish in DE∣CEMBER
and JANUARY, and decay in MAY and
JUNE? Now whatever is intelligible, and can be dis∣tinctly
conceived, implies no contradiction, and can
never be proved false by any demonstrative argu∣ments
or abstract reasonings <HI>à priori.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
IF we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put
trust in past experience, and make it the standard of
our future judgment, these arguments must be pro∣bable
only, or such as regard matter of fact and real
existence, according to the division above-mentioned.
But that there are no arguments of this kind, must
appear, if our explication of that species of reasoning be
admitted as solid and satisfactory. We have said, that
all arguments concerning existence are founded on the
relation of cause and effect; that our knowlege of
that relation is derived entirely from experience, and
that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon
the supposition that the future will be conformable to
the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this
last supposition by probable arguments, or arguments
regarding existence, must be evidently going in a
circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very
point in question.</P>
<P>IN reality, all arguments from experience are
founded on the similarity, which we discover among
natural objects, and by which we are induced to ex∣pect
effects similar to those, which we have found to
follow from such objects. And tho' none but a fool
or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority
of experience, or to reject that great guide of human
life; it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have
so much curiosity at least, as to examine the principle
of human nature which gives this mighty authority to
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
experience, and makes us draw advantage from that
similarity, which nature has placed among different
objects. From causes, which appear <HI>similar,</HI> we ex∣pect
similar effects. This is the sum of all our expe∣rimental
conclusions. Now it seems evident, that if
this conclusion were formed by reason, it would be
as perfect at first, and upon one instance, as after ever
so long a course of experience. But the case is far
otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs; yet no one, on
account of this apparent similarity, expects the same
taste and relish in all of them. 'Tis only after a long
course of uniform experiments in any kind, that we
attain a firm reliance and security with regard to a
particular event. Now where is that process of rea∣soning,
which from one instance draws a conclusion,
so different from that which it infers from an hun∣dred
instances, that are no way different from that
single instance? This question I propose as much for
the sake of information, as with an intention of rais∣ing
difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any
such reasoning. But I keep my mind still open to
instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it
on me.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be said, that from a number of uni∣form
experiments, we <HI>infer</HI> a connection between the
sensible qualities and the secret powers; this, I must
confess, seems the same difficulty, couched in diffe∣rent
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
terms. The question still recurs, On what pro∣cess
of argument this <HI>inference</HI> is founded? Where
is the medium, the interposing ideas, which join pro∣popositions
so very wide of each other? 'Tis con∣fessed,
that the colour, consistence and other sensible
qualities of bread appear not, of themselves, to have
any connexion with the secret powers of nourishment
and support. For otherwise we could infer these se∣cret
powers from the first appearance of these sensible
qualities, without the aid of experience; contrary to
the sentiment of all philosophers, and contrary to
plain matter of fact. Here then is our natural state
of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence
of all objects. How is this remedied by experience?
It only shews us a number of uniform effects, result∣ing
from certain objects, and teaches us, that those
particular objects, at that particular time, were en∣dowed
with such powers and forces. When a new
object, endowed with similar sensible qualities is pro∣duced,
we expect similar powers and forces, and lay
our account with a like effect. From a body of like
colour and consistence with bread, we look for like
nourishment and support. But this furely is a step or
progress of the mind, which wants to be explained.
When a man says, <HI>I have found, in all past instances,
such sensible qualities, conjoined with such secret powers:</HI>
And when he says, <HI>similar sensible qualities will always
be conjoined with similar secret powers;</HI> he is not guilty
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
of a tautology, nor are these propositions in any re∣spect
the same: You say that the one proposition is
an inference from another. But you must confess,
that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it de∣monstrative:
Of what nature is it then? To say it
is experimental is begging the question. For all in∣ferences
from experience suppose, as their foundation,
that the future will resemble the past, and that simi∣lar
powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qua∣lities.
If there be any suspicion, that the course of
nature may change, and that the past may be no rule
for the future, all experience becomes useless, and
can give rise to no inference or conclusion. 'Tis im∣possible,
therefore, that any arguments from experi∣ence
can prove this resemblance of the past to the
future; since all these arguments are founded on the
supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of
things be allowed hitherto ever so regular; that alone,
without some new argument or inference, proves not,
that, for the future, it will continue so. In vain do
you pretend to have learnt the nature of bodies from
your past experience. Their secret nature, and con∣sequently,
all their effects and influence may change,
without any change in their sensible qualities. This
happens sometimes, and with regard to some objects:
Why may it not happen always, and with regard to
all objects? What logic, what process of argument
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
secures you against this supposition? My Practice, you
say, refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport
of my question. As an agent, I am quite satisfied in
the point; but as a philosopher, who has some share
of curiosity, I will not say scepticism, I want to learn
the foundation of this inference. No reading, no
enquiry has yet been able to remove my difficulty,
or give me satisfaction in a matter of such vast im∣portance.
Can I do better than propose the difficulty
to the public, even tho', perhaps, I have small hopes
of obtaining a solution? We shall at least, by this
means, be sensible of our ignorance, if we do not
augment our knowlege.</P>
<P>I MUST confess, that a man is guilty of unpar∣donable
arrogance, who concludes, because an argu∣ment
has escaped his own investigation, that there∣fore
it does not really exist. I must also confess,
that tho' all the learned, for several ages, should have
employed their time in fruitless search upon any sub∣ject,
it may still, perhaps, be rash to conclude posi∣tively,
that the subject must, therefore, pass all hu∣man
comprehension. Even tho' we examine all the
sources of our knowlege, and conclude them unfit
for such a subject, there may still remain a suspicion,
that the enumeration is not compleat, or the exami∣nation
not accurate. But with regard to the present
subject, there are some considerations, which seem to
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion
of mistake.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that the most ignorant and stupid pea∣sants, nay infants, nay even brute beasts improve by
experience, and learn the qualities of natural objects,
by observing the effects, which result from them.
When a child has felt the sensation of pain from
touching the flame of a candle, he will be careful not
to put his hand near any candle; but will expect a
similar effect from a cause, which is similar in its
sensible qualities and appearance. If you assert, there∣fore,
that the understanding of the child is led into
this conclusion by any process of argument or ratio∣cination,
I may justly require you to produce that
argument; nor have you any pretext to refuse so
equitable a demand. You cannot say, that the ar∣gument
is abstruse, and may possibly escape your
enquiry; since you confess, that it is obvious to the
capacity of a mere infant. If you hesitate, there∣fore,
a moment, or if, after reflection, you produce
any intricate or profound argument, you, in a man∣ner,
give up the question, and confess, that it is
not reasoning which engages us to suppose the past
resembling the future, and to expect similar effects
from causes, which are, to appearance, similar. This
is the proposition, which I intended to enforce in
the present section. If I be right, I pretend to have
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
made no mighty discovery. And if I be wrong, I
must acknowlege myself to be indeed a very back∣ward
scholar: since I cannot now discover an argument,
which, it seems, was perfectly familiar to me, long
before I was out of my cradle.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THE passion for philosophy, like that for religion,
seems liable to this inconvenience, that, tho' it
aims at the correction of our manners, and extirpa∣tion
of our vices, it may only serve, by imprudent
management, to foster a predominant inclination, and
push the mind, with more determined resolution, to∣wards
that side, which already <HI>draws</HI> too much, by
the byass and propensity of the natural temper.
'Tis certain, that, while we aspire to the magnani∣mous
firmness of the philosophic sage, and endeavour
to confine our pleasures altogether within our own
minds, we may, at last, render our philosophy, like
that of EPICTETUS, and other <HI>Stoics,</HI> only a more
refined system of selfishness, and reason ourselves out
of all virtue, as well as social enjoyment. While we
study with attention the vanity of human life, and
turn all our thoughts on the empty and transitory
nature of riches and honors, we are, perhaps, all the
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
while flattering our natural indolence, which, hating
the bustle of the world and drudgery of business,
seeks a pretext of reason, to give itself a full and
uncontroled indulgence. There is, however, one
species of philosophy, which seems little liable to
this inconvenience, and that because it strikes in with
no disorderly passion of the human mind, nor can
mingle itself with any natural affection or propensity;
and that is the ACADEMIC or SCEPTICAL philoso∣phy.
The academics talk always of doubts, and
suspense of judgment, of danger in hasty determina∣tions,
of confining to very narrow bounds the enqui∣ries
of the understanding, and of renouncing all spe∣culations
which lie not within the limits of common
life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can be more
contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indo∣lence
of the mind, its rash arrogance, its lofty pre∣tensions,
and its superstitious credulity. Every pas∣sion
is mortfied by it, except the love of truth; and
that passion never is, nor can be carried to too high
a degree. 'Tis surprizing, therefore, that this philo∣sophy,
which, in almost every instance, must be
harmless and innocent, should be the subject of so
much groundless reproach and obloquy. But, per∣haps,
the very circumstance which renders it so inno∣cent,
is what chiefly exposes it to the public hatred,
and resentment. By flattering no irregular passion, it
gains few partizans: By opposing so many vices and
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
follies, it raises to itself abundance of enemies, who
stigmatize it as libertine, profane, and irreligious.</P>
<P>NOR need we fear, that this philosophy, while
it endeavours to limit our enquiries to common life,
should ever undermine the reasonings of common
life, and carry its doubts so far as to destroy all action,
as well as speculation. Nature will always maintain
her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract
reasoning whatsoever. Tho' we should conclude,
for instance, as in the foregoing section, that, in all
reasonings from experience, there is a step taken by
the mind, which is not supported by any argument
or process of the understanding; there is no danger,
that these reasonings, on which almost all knowledge
depends, will ever be affected by such a discovery.
If the mind be not engaged by argument to make
this step, it must be induced by some other principle
of equal weight and authority; and that principle
will preserve its influence as long as human nature re∣mains
the same. What that principle is, may well
be worth the pains of enquiry.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a person, tho' endowed with the strong∣est
faculties of reason and reflection, to be brought
on a sudden into this world; he would, indeed, im∣mediately
observe a continual succession of objects,
and one event following another; but he would not
be able to discover any thing farther. He would
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
not, at first, by any reasoning, be able to reach the
idea of cause and effect; since the particular powers,
by which all natural operations are performed, never
appear to the senses; nor is it reasonable to conclude,
merely because one event, in one instance, precedes
another, that therefore the one is the cause, and the
other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitra∣ry
and casual. There may be no reason to infer the
existence of the one from the appearance of the
other. And in a word, such a person without more
experience, could never employ his conjecture or rea∣soning
concerning any matter or fact, or be assured
of any thing beyond what was immediately present
to his memory and senses.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE again, that he has acquired more expe∣rience,
and has lived so long in the world as to have
observed similar objects or events to be constantly
conjoined together; what is the consequence of this
experience? He immediately insers the existence of
the one object from the appearance of the other.
Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired any
idea or knowlege of the secret power, by which the
one object produces the other; nor is it, by any pro∣cess
of reasoning, he is engaged to draw this infe∣rence.
But still he finds himself determined to draw
it: And tho' he should be convinced, that his under∣standing
has no part in the operation, he would ne∣vertheless
continue in the same course of thinking.
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
There is some other principle, which determines him
to form such a conclusion.</P>
<P>THIS principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For where∣ever
the repetition of any particular act or operation
produces a propensity to renew the same act or ope∣ration,
without being impelled by any reasoning or
process of the understanding; we always say, that
this propensity is the effect of <HI>Custom.</HI> By employ∣ing
that word, we pretend not to have given the ulti∣mate
reason of such a propensity. We only point out
a principle of human nature, which is universally ac∣knowledged,
and which is well known by its effects.
Perhaps, we can push our enquiries no farther, or
pretend to give the cause of this cause; but must rest
contented with it as the ultimate principle, which
we can assign of all our conclusions from experience.
'Tis sufficient satisfaction, that we can go so far;
without repining at the narrowness of our faculties,
because they will carry us no farther. And 'tis cer∣tain
we here advance a very intelligible proposition at
least, if not a true one, when we assert, that, after
the constant conjunction of two objects, heat and
flame, for instance, weight and solidity, we are de∣termined
by custom alone to expect the one from
the appearance of the other. This hypothesis seems
even the only one, which explains the difficulty,
why we draw, from a thousand instances, an in∣ference,
which we are not able to draw from
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
one instance, that is, in no respect, different from
them. Reason is incapable of any such varia∣tion.
The conclusions, which it draws from consi∣dering
one circle, are the same which it would form
upon surveying all the circles in the universe. But no
man, having seen only one body move after being
impelled by another, could infer, that every other
body will move after a like impulse. All inferences
from experience, therefore, are effects of custom, not
of reasoning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nothing is more usual than for writers even on <HI>moral, poli∣tical,</HI> or <HI>physical</HI> subjects, to distinguish between <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>experi∣ence,</HI> and to suppose, that these species of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The former are taken for the mere result of our intellectual faculties, which, by consider∣ing <HI>à priori</HI> the nature of things, and examining the effects, that must follow from their operation, establish particular principles of science and philosophy. The latter are supposed to be derived entirely from sense and observation, by which we learn what has actually resulted from the operation of particular objects, and are thence able to infer, what will, for the future, result from them. Thus, for instance, the limitations and restraints of civil government, and a legal constitution may be desended, either from <HI>reason,</HI> which, reflecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can safely be trusted with unlimited authority; or from <HI>experience</HI> and history, which inform us of the enormous abuses, that ambition, in every age and country, has been found to make of so imprudent a confi∣dence.</P>
<P>The same distinction betwixt reason and experience is main∣tained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of life; while the experienced statesman, general, physician or merchant is trusted and followed; and the unpractised novice, with what∣ever natural talents endowed, neglected and despised. Tho' it be allowed, that reason may form very plausible conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances; 'tis still supposed imperfect, without the assistance of experience, which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims, derived from study and reflection.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally received, both in the active and speculative scenes of life, I shall not scruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom, erroneous, or at least, superficial.</P>
<P>If we examine those arguments, which, in any of the sciences above-mentioned, are supposed to be the mere effects of reasoning and reflection, they will all be found to terminate, at last, in some general principle or conclusion, for which we can assign no reason but observation and experience. The only difference be∣twixt them and those maxims, which are vulgarly esteemed the result of pure experience, is, that the former cannot be estab∣lished without some process of thought, and some reflection on what we have observed, in order to distinguish its circumstances, and trace its consequences: Whereas in the latter, the experi∣enced event is exactly and fully similar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation. The history of a TIBE∣RIUS or a NERO makes us dread a like tyranny were our mo∣narchs freed from the restraints of laws and senates: But the observation of any fraud or cruelty in private life is sufficient, with the aid of a little thought, to give us the same apprehen∣sion; while it serves as an instance of the general corruption of human nature, and shews us the danger which we must incur by reposing an entire confidence in mankind. In both cases, 'tis experience which is ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion.</P>
<P>There is no man so young and unexperienced, as not to have formed from observation, many general and just maxims con∣cerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it must be confessed, that, when a man comes to put these in practice, he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther experience, both enlarge these maxims, and teach him their proper use and application. In every situation or incident, there are many par∣ticular and seemingly minute circumstances, which the man of greatest talents is, at first, apt to overlook, tho' on them the justness of his conclusions, and consequently the prudence of his conduct, entirely depend. Not to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general observations and maxims occur not always on the proper occasions, nor can be immediately applied with due calmness and distinction. The truth is, an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at all, were he absolutely unexpe∣rienced; and when we assign that character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative sense, and suppose him possessed of ex∣perience, in a smaller and more imperfect degree.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
CUSTOM, then, is the great guide of human life.
'Tis that principle alone, which renders our expe∣rience
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
useful to us, and makes us expect for the fu∣ture,
a similar train of events with those which have
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
appeared in the past. Without the influence of cus∣tom,
we should be entirely ignorant of every matter
of fact, beyond what is immediately present to the
memory and senses. We should never know how to
adjust means to ends, or to employ our natural powers
in the production of any effect. There would be an
end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part
of speculation.</P>
<P>BUT here it may be proper to remark, that tho'
our conclusions from experience carry us beyond our
memory and senses, and assure us of matters of fact,
which happened in the most distant places and most
remote ages; yet some fact must always be present
to the senses or memory, from which we may first pro∣ceed
in drawing these conclusions. A man, who
should find in a desert country the remains of pomp∣ous
buildings, would conclude, that the country had,
in antient times, been cultivated by civilized inhabi∣tants;
but did nothing of this nature occur to him,
he could never form such an inference. We learn the
events of former ages from history; but then we must
peruse the volumes, in which this instruction is con∣tained,
and thence carry up our inferences from one
testimony to another, till we arrive at the eye-witnes∣ses
and spectators of these distant events. In a word,
if we proceed not upon some fact, present to the me∣mory
or senses, our reasonings would be merely hy∣pothetical;
and however the particular links might
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
be connected with each other, the whole chain of in∣ferences
would have nothing to support it, nor could
we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowlege of
any real existence. If I ask, why you believe any
particular matter of fact, which you relate, you must
tell me some reason; and this reason will be some
other fact, connected with it: But as you cannot pro∣ceed
after this manner, <HI>in infinitum,</HI> you must at last
terminate in some fact, which is present to your me∣mory
or senses; or must allow, that your belief is en∣tirely
without foundation.</P>
<P>WHAT then is the conclusion of the whole matter?
A simple one; tho' it must be confessed, pretty re∣mote
from the common theories of philosophy. All
belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived
merely from some object, present to the memory or
senses, and a customary conjunction betwixt that and
any other object. Or in other words; having found,
in many instances, that any two kinds of objects,
flame and heat, snow and cold, have always been
conjoined together; if flame or snow be presented
anew to our senses; the mind is carried by custom to
expect heat or cold, and to <HI>believe,</HI> that such a qua∣lity
does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer
approach. This belief is the necessary result of plac∣ing
the mind in such circumstances. 'Tis an opera∣tion
of the soul, when we are so situated, as unavoid∣able
as to feel the passion of love, when we receive
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
benefits, or hatred, when we meet with injuries.
All these operations are a species of natural instincts,
which no reasoning or process of the thought and un∣derstanding
is able, either to produce, or to prevent.</P>
<P>AT this point, it would be very allowable for us
to stop our philosophical researches. In most ques∣tions,
we can never make a single step farther; and
in all questions, we must terminate here at last, after
our most restless and curious enquiries. But still our
curiosity will be pardonable, perhaps commendable,
if it carry us on to still farther researches, and make
us examine more accurately the nature of this <HI>belief,</HI>
and of the <HI>customary conjunction,</HI> whence it is derived.
By this means we may meet some explications and
analogies, that will give satisfaction; at least to such
as love the abstract sciences, and can be entertained
with speculations, which, however accurate, may
still retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to
readers of a different taste; the remaining part of
this section is not calculated for them, and the fol∣lowing
enquiries may well be understood, tho' it be
neglected.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more free than the imagination
of man; and tho' it cannot exceed that original stock
of ideas, which is furnished by the internal and ex∣ternal
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
senses, it has unlimited power of mixing, com∣pounding,
separating, and dividing these ideas, to
all the varieties of fiction and vision. It can feign a
train of events, with all the appearance of reali∣ty,
ascribe to them a particular time and place, con∣ceive
them as existent, and paint them out to itself
with every circumstance, that belongs to any historical
fact, which it believes with the greatest certainty.
Wherein, therefore, consists the difference between
such a fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any
peculiar idea, which is annexed to such a conception,
as commands our assent, and which is wanting to every
known fiction. For as the mind has authority over
all its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular
idea to any fiction, and consequently be able to be∣lieve
whatever it pleases; contrary to what we find
by daily experience. We can, in our conception,
join the head of a man to the body of a horse; but
it is not in our power to believe, that such an animal
has ever really existed.</P>
<P>IT follows, therefore, that the difference between
<HI>fiction</HI> and <HI>belief</HI> lies in some sentiment or feeling,
which is annexed to the latter, not to the former, and
which depends not on the will, nor can be com∣manded
at pleasure. It must be excited by nature,
like all other sentiments; and must arise from the par∣ticular
situation, in which the mind is placed at any
particular juncture. Whenever any object is pre∣sented
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
to the memory or senses, it immediately, by
the force of custom, carries the imagination to con∣ceive
that object, which is usually conjoined to it;
and this conception is attended with a feeling or sen∣timent,
different from the loose reveries of the fancy.
In this consists the whole nature of belief. For as
there is no matter of fact which we believe so firmly,
that we cannot conceive the contrary, there would
be no difference between the conception assented to,
and that which is rejected, were it not for some sen∣timent,
which distinguishes the one from the other.
If I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a
smooth table, I can easily conceive it to stop upon
contact. This conception implies no contradiction;
but still it feels very differently from that conception,
by which I represent to myself the impulse, and the
communication of motion from one ball to another.</P>
<P>WERE we to attempt a <HI>definition</HI> of this sentiment,
we should, perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an
impossible task; in the same manner as if we should
endeavour to define the feeling of cold or passion of
anger, to a creature who never had an experience of
these sentiments. BELIEF is the true and proper
name of this feeling; and no one is ever at a loss to
know the meaning of that term; because every man
is every moment conscious of the sentiment, repre∣sented
by it. It may not, however, be improper to
attempt a <HI>description</HI> of this sentiment; in hopes we
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
may, by that means, arrive at some analogies, which
may afford a more perfect explication of it. I say
then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively,
forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than
what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.
This variety of terms, which may seem so unphilo∣sophical,
is intended only to express that act of the
mind, which renders realities, or what is taken for
such, more present to us than fictions, causes them to
weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior
influence on the passions and imagination. Provided
we agree about the thing, 'tis needless to dispute
about the terms. The imagination has the command
over all its ideas, and can join and mix and vary
them, in all the ways possible. It may conceive ficti∣tious
objects with all the circumstances of place and
time. It may set them, in a manner, before our eyes,
in their true colors, just as they might have existed.
But as it is impossible, that that faculty of imagina∣tion
can ever, of itself, reach belief, 'tis evident,
that belief consists not in the peculiar nature or order
of ideas, but in the <HI>manner</HI> of their conception, and
in their <HI>feeling</HI> to the mind. I confess, that 'tis im∣possible
perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of
conception. We may make use of words, which ex∣press
something near it. But its true and proper
name, as we observed before, is <HI>belief;</HI> which is a
term, that every one sufficiently understands in com∣mon
life. And in philosophy, we can go no farther
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
than assert, that <HI>belief</HI> is something felt by the mind,
which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from
the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more
force and influence; makes them appear of greater
importance; inforces them in the mind; and renders
them the governing principle of all our actions. I
hear at present, for instance, a person's voice, with
whom I am acquainted; and the sound comes as from
the next room. This impression of my senses imme∣diately
conveys my thought to the person, together
with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to
myself as existing at present, with the same qualities
and relations, of which I formerly knew them possest.
These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than ideas
of an inchanted castle. They are very different to
the feeling, and have a much greater influence of
every kind, either to give pleasure or pain, joy or sor∣row.</P>
<P>LET
us, then, take in the whole compass of this
doctrine, and allow, that the sentiment of belief is
nothing but a conception of an object more intense
and steady than what attends the mere fictions of the
imagination, and that this <HI>manner</HI> of conception arises
from a customary conjunction of the object with
something present to the memory or senses: I believe
that it will not be difficult, upon these suppositions,
to find other operations of the mind analogous to it,
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
and to trace up these phaenomena to principles still
more general.</P>
<P>WE have already observed, that nature has esta∣blished
connexions among particular ideas, and that
no sooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it in∣troduces
its correlative, and carries our attention to∣wards
it, by a gentle and insensible movement. These
principles of connexion or association we have re∣duced
to three, <HI>viz. Resemblance, Contiguity,</HI> and
<HI>Causation;</HI> which are the only bonds, that unite our
thoughts together, and beget that regular train of
reflection or discourse, which, in a greater or less de∣gree,
takes place among all mankind. Now here
arises a question, on which the solution of the present
difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all these
relations, that, when one of the objects is presented
to the senses or memory, the mind is not only carried
to the conception of the correlative, but reaches a
steadier and stronger conception of it than what other∣wise
it would have been able to attain? This seems
to be the case with that belief, which arises from the
relation of cause and effect. And if the case be the
same with the other relations or principles of associ∣ation,
we may establish this as a general law, which
takes place in all the operations of the mind.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, observe, as the first experi∣ment
to our present purpose, that, upon the appear∣ance
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
of the picture of an absent friend, our idea of
him is evidently enlivened by the <HI>resemblance,</HI> and
that every passion, which that idea occasions, whe∣ther
of joy or sorrow, acquires new force and vi∣gor.
In producing this effect, there concur both a
relation and a present impression. Where the picture
bears him no resemblance, or at least was not intend∣ed
for him, it never so much as conveys our thought
to him: And where it is absent, as well as the per∣son;
though the mind may pass from the thought of
the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be
rather weakened than enlivened by that transition.
We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend,
when 'tis set before us; but when 'tis removed, ra∣ther
chuse to consider him directly, than by reflection
in an image, which is equally distant and obscure.</P>
<P>THE ceremonies of the ROMAN CATHOLIC reli∣gion
may be considered as experiments of the same
nature. The devotees of that superstition usually
plead in excuse of the mummeries, with which they
are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of those
external motions, and postures, and actions, in en∣livening
their devotion and quickening their servor,
which otherwise would decay, if directed intirely to
distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the
objects of our faith, say they, in sensible types and
images, and render them more present to us by the
immediate presence of these types, than 'tis possible
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and con∣templation.
Sensible objects have always a greater
influence on the fancy than any other; and this in∣fluence
they readily convey to those ideas, to which
they are related, and which they resemble. I shall
only infer from these practices, and this reasoning,
that the effect of resemblance in enlivening the ideas
is very common; and as in every case a resemblance
and a present impression must concur, we are abun∣dantly
supplied with experiments to prove the reality
of the foregoing principle.</P>
<P>WE may add force to these experiments by others
of a different kind, in considering the effects of <HI>conti∣guity</HI>
as well as of <HI>resemblance.</HI> 'Tis certain that di∣stance
diminishes the force of every idea, and that
upon our approach to any object; tho' it does not
discover itself to our senses; it operates upon the
mind with an influence, which imitates an immediate
impression. The thinking on any object readily
transports the mind to what is contiguous; but
'tis only the actual presence of an object, that trans∣ports
it with a superior vivacity. When I am a
few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches
me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues
distant; tho' even at that distance the reflecting on
any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends or fa∣mily
naturally produces an idea of them. But as in
this latter case, both the objects of the mind are
ideas; notwithstanding there is an easy transition be∣tween
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
them; that transition alone is not able to give
a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of
some immediate impression<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>"Naturane nobis, inquit, datum dicam, an errore quo∣dam, ut, cum ea loca videamus, in quibus memoria dignos viros acceperimus multum esse versatos, magis moveamur, quam siquando corum ipsorum aut facta audiamus aut scrip∣tum aliquod legamus?

<P>NO one can doubt but causation has the same in∣fluence
as the other two relations of resemblance and
contiguity. Superstitious people are fond of the re∣licts
of saints and holy men, for the same reason,
that they seek after types or images, in order to en∣liven
their devotion, and give them a more intimate
and strong conception of those exemplary lives, which
they desire to imitate. Now 'tis evident, that one
of the best relicts, which a devotee could procure,
would be the handywork of a saint; and if his cloaths
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
and furniture are ever to be considered in this light,
'tis because they were once at his disposal, and were
moved and affected by him; in which respect they
are to be considered as imperfect effects, and as con∣nected
with him by a shorter chain of consequences
than any of those, by which we learn the reality of
his existence.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, that the son of a friend, who had been
long dead or absent, were presented to us; 'tis evi∣dent,
that this object would instantly revive its corre∣lative
idea, and recal to our thoughts all past intima∣cies
and familiarities in more lively colors than they
would otherwise have appeared to us. This is ano∣ther
phaenomenon, which seems to prove the principle
above-mentioned.</P>
<P>WE may observe, that in these phaenomena the
belief of the correlative object is always pre-sup∣posed;
without which the relation could have no ef∣fect
in enlivening the idea. The influence of the
picture supposes, that we <HI>believe</HI> our friend to have
once existed. Contiguity to home can never excite
our ideas of home, unless we <HI>believe</HI> that it really ex∣ists.
Now I assert, that this belief, where it reaches
beyond the memory or senses, is of a similar nature,
and arises from similar causes, with the transition of
thought and vivacity of conception here explained.
When I throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
mind is immediately carried to conceive, that it aug∣ments,
not extinguishes the flame. This transition of
thought from the cause to the effect proceeds not from
reason. It derives its origin altogether from custom
and experience. And as it first begins from an ob∣ject,
present to the senses, it renders the idea or con∣ception
of flame more strong and lively than any
loose, floating reverie of the imagination. That idea
arises immediately. The thought moves instantly to∣wards
it, and conveys to it all that force of concep∣tion,
which is derived from the impression present to
the senses. When a sword is levelled at my breast,
does not the idea of wound and pain strike me more
strongly, than when a glass of wine is presented to
me, even tho' by accident this idea should occur after
the appearance of the latter object? But what is there
in this whole matter to cause such a strong concep∣tion,
except only a present object and customary tran∣sition
to the idea of another object, which we have
been accustomed to conjoin with the former? This is
the whole operation of the mind in all our conclusions
concerning matter of fact and existence; and 'tis a
satisfaction to find some analogies, by which it may
be explained. The transition from a present object
does in all cases give strength and solidity to the related
idea.</P>
<P>HERE is a kind of pre-established harmony be∣tween
the course of nature and the succession of our
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
ideas; and tho' the powers and forces, by which the
former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet
our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone
on in the same train with the other works of nature.
Custom is that admirable principle, by which this
correspondence has been effected; so necessary to the
subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our
conduct, in every circumstance and occurrence of hu∣man
life. Had not the presence of an object instant∣ly
excited the idea of those objects, commonly
conjoined with it, all our knowledge must have been
limited to the narrow sphere of our memory and sen∣ses;
and we should never have been able to adjust
means to ends, nor employ our natural powers, either
to the producing of good, or avoiding of evil. Those,
who delight in the discovery and contemplation of <HI>fi∣nal
causes,</HI> have here ample subject to employ their
wonder and admiration.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, for a further confirmation of the
foregoing theory, that as this operation of the mind,
by which we infer like effects from like causes, and
<HI>vice versa,</HI> is so essential to the subsistence of all hu∣man
creatures, it is not probable that it could be
trusted to the fallacious deductions of our reason,
which is slow in its operations; appears not, in any
degree, during the first years of infancy; and at best
is, in every age and period of human life, extremely
liable to error and mistake. 'Tis more conformable
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
to the ordinary wisdom of nature of secure so necessa∣ry
an act of the mind, by some instinct or mechanical
tendency, which may be infallible in its operations,
may discover itself at the first appearance of life and
thought, and may be independent of all the labored
deductions of the understanding. As nature has
taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the
knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they
are actuated; so has she implanted in us an instinct,
which carries forward the thought in a correspondent
course to that which she has established among exter∣nal
objects; tho' we are ignorant of those powers
and forces, on which this regular course and succes∣sion
of objects totally depends.</P>

the probability would be much higher, and
our belief or expectation of the event more steady
and secure. This process of the thought or reason∣ing
may seem trivial and obvious; but to those, who
consider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford
matter for very curious speculations.</P>
<P>IT seems evident, that when the mind looks for∣ward
to discover the event, which may result from the
throw of such a dye, it considers the turning up of
each particular side as alike probable; and this is the
very nature of chance, to render all the particular
events, comprehended in it, entirely equal. But
finding a greater number of sides concur in the one
event than in the other, the mind is carried more fre∣quently
to that event, and meets it oftener, in revolv∣ing
the various possibilities or chances, on which the
ultimate result depends. This concurrence of several
views in one particular event begets immediately, by
an inexplicable contrivance of nature, the sentiment
of belief, and gives that event the advantage over its
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
antagonist, which is supported by a smaller number
of views, and recurs less frequently to the mind. If
we allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and
stronger conception of an object than what attends
the mere fictions of the imagination, this operation
may, perhaps, in some measure, be accounted for.
The concurrence of these several views or glimpses
imprints its idea more strongly on the imagination;
gives it superior force and vigor; renders its influence
on the passions and affections more sensible; and in
a word, begets that reliance or security, which con∣stitutes
the nature of belief and opinion.</P>
<P>THE case is the same with the probability of causes,
as with that of chance. There are some causes,
which are entirely uniform and constant in producing
a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been
found of any failure or irregularity in their operation.
Fire has always burnt, and water suffocated every hu∣man
creature: The production of motion by impulse
and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto
admitted of no exception. But there are other causes
which have been found more irregular and uncertain;
nor has rhubarb proved always a purge, or opium a
soporific to every one, who has taken these medicines.
'Tis true, when any cause fails of producing its usual
effect, philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity
in nature; but suppose, that some secret causes, in
the particular structure of parts, have prevented the
<PB N="94" REF="94"/>
operation. Our reasonings, however, and conclu∣sions
concerning the event are the same as if this prin∣ciple
had no place. Being determined by custom to
transfer the past to the future, in all our inferences;
where the past has been entirely regular and uniform,
we expect the event with the greatest assurance, and
leave no room for any contrary supposition. But
where different effects have been found to follow from
causes, which are <HI>to appearance</HI> exactly similar, all
these various effects must occur to the mind in trans∣fering
the past to the future, and enter into our consi∣deration,
when we determine the probability of the
event. Tho' we give the preference to that which
has been found most usual, and believe that this effect
will exist, we must not overlook the other effects, but
must give each of them a particular weight and au∣thority,
in proportion as we have found it to be more
or less frequent. 'Tis more probable, in every place
of EUROPE, that there will be frost sometime in JA∣NUARY,
than that the weather will continue open
throughout that whole month; who' this probability
varies according to the different climates, and ap∣proaches
to a certainty in the more northern king∣doms.
Here then it seems evident, that when we
transfer the past to the future, in order to determine
the effect, which will result from any cause, we trans∣fer
all the different events, in the same proportion as
they have appeared in the past, and conceive one to
have existed a hundred times, for instance, another
<PB N="95" REF="95"/>
ten times, and another once. As a great number of
views do here concur in one event, they fortify and
confirm it to the imagination, beget that sentiment
which we call <HI>belief,</HI> and give it the preference above
its antagonist, which is not supported by an equal
number of experiments, and occurs not so frequently
to the thought in transferring the past to the future.
Let any one try to account for this operation of the
mind upon any of the received systems of philosophy,
and he will be sensible of the difficulty. For my part,
I shall think it sufficient, if the present hints excite
the curiosity of philosophers, and make them sensible
how extremely defective all common theories are, in
treating of such curious and such sublime subjects.</P>

<P>THE great advantage of the mathematical sci∣ences
above the moral consists in this, that the
ideas of the former, being sensible, are always clear
and determinate, the smallest distinction between
them is immediately perceptible, and the same terms
are still expressive of the same ideas, without ambi∣guity
or variation. An oval is never mistaken for a
circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles
and scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more
exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong. If any
term be desined in geometry, the mind readily, of it∣self
substitutes, on all occasions, the definition for the
term defined; Or even when no definition is employ∣ed,
the object itself may be presented to the senses,
and by that means be steadily and clearly apprehend∣ed.
But the finer sentiments of the mind, the opera∣tions
of the understanding, the various agitations of
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
the passions, tho' really in themselves distinct, easily
escape us, when surveyed by reflection; nor is it in
our power to recall the original object, as often as we
have occasion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this
means, is gradually introduced into our reasonings:
Similar objects are readily taken to be the same: And
the conclusion becomes at last very wide of the premi∣ses.</P>
<P>ONE
may safely, however, affirm, that, if we con∣sider
these sciences in a proper light, their advantages
and disadvantages very nearly compensate each other,
and reduce both of them to a state of equality. If
the mind with greater facility retains the ideas of ge∣ometry
clear and determinate, it must carry on a
much longer and more intricate chain of reasoning,
and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order
to reach the abstruser truths of that science. And if
moral ideas are apt, without extreme care, to fall into
obscurity and confusion, the inferences are always
much shorter in these disquisitions, and the interme∣diate
steps, which lead to the conclusion, much fewer
than in the sciences which treat of quantity and num∣ber.
In reality, there is scarce a proposition in EU∣CLID
so simple, as not to consist of more parts, than
are to be found in any moral reasoning which runs
not into chimera and conceit. Where we trace the
principles of the human mind thro' a few steps, we
may be very well satisfied with our progress; consi∣dering
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
how soon nature throws a bar to all our in∣quiries
concerning causes, and reduces us to an ac∣knowledgment
of our ignorance. The chief obsta∣cle,
therefore, to our improvement in the moral or
metaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and
ambiguity of the terms. The principal difficulty in
the mathematics is the length of inferences and com∣pass
of thought, requisite to the forming any conclu∣sion.
And perhaps, our progress in natural philo∣sophy
is chiefly retarded by the want of proper expe∣riments
and phaenomena, which often are discovered
by chance, and cannot always be found, when requi∣site,
even by the most diligent and prudent inquiry.
As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have received
less improvements than either geometry or physics,
we may conclude, that, if there be any difference in
this respect among these sciences, the difficulties,
which obstruct the progress of the former, require su∣perior
care and capacity to be surmounted.</P>
<P>THERE are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics,
more obscure and uncertain, than those of <HI>power▪
force, energy,</HI> or <HI>necessary connexion,</HI> of which it is every
moment necessary for us to treat in all our disquisitions.
We shall, therefore, endeavour, in this section, to fix,
if possible, the precise meaning of these terms, and
thereby remove some part of that obscurity, which is
so much complained of in this species of philosophy.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99"/>
IT seems a proposition, which will not admit of
much dispute, that all our ideas are nothing but co∣pies
of our impressions, or, in other words, that 'tis
impossible for us to <HI>think</HI> of any thing, which we have
not antecedently <HI>felt,</HI> either by our external or internal
senses. I have endeavoured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section II.</NOTE> to explain and prove
this proposition, and have expressed my hopes, that,
by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater
clearness and precision in philosophical reasonings,
than what they have hitherto been ever able to at∣tain.
Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known
by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of
those parts or simple ideas, that compose them. But
when we have pushed up definitions to the most sim∣ple
ideas, and find still some ambiguity and obscurity;
what resource are we then possessed of? By what in∣vention
can we throw light upon these ideas, and ren∣der
them altogether precise and determinate to our
intellectual view? Produce the impressions or original
sentiments, from which the ideas are copied. These
impressions are all strong and sensible. They admit
not of ambiguity. They are not only placed in a
full light themselves, but may throw light on their
correspondent ideas, which lie in obscurity. And by
this means, we may, perhaps, attain a new microscope
or species of optics, by which, in the moral sciences,
the most minute, and most simple ideas may be so en∣larged
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
as to fall readily under our apprehension, and
be equally known with the grossest and most sensible
ideas, which can be the object of our inquiry.</P>
<P>To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of
power or necessary connexion, let us examine its im∣pression;
and in order to find the impression with
greater certainty, let us search for it in all the sources,
from which it may possibly be derived.</P>
<P>WHEN we look about us towards external objects,
and consider the operation of causes, we are never
able, in a single instance, to discover any power or ne∣cessary
connexion; any quality, which binds the effect
to the cause, and renders the one an infallible conse∣quence
of the other. We only find, that the one
does actually, in fact, follow the other. The impulse
of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the se∣cond.
This is the whole that appears to the <HI>outward</HI>
senses. The mind feels no sentiment or <HI>inward</HI> im∣pression
from this succession of objects: Consequently,
there is not, in any single, particular instance of cause
and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of
power or necessary connexion.</P>
<P>FROM the first appearance of an object, we never
can conjecture what effect will result from it. But
were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by
the mind, we could foresee the effect, even without
<PB N="102" REF="101"/>
experience, and might, at first, pronounce with cer∣tainty
concerning it, by the mere dint of thought and
reasoning.</P>
<P>IN reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever,
by its sensible qualities, discover any power or energy,
or give us ground to imagine, that it could produce
any thing, or be followed by any other object, which
we could denominate its effect. Solidity, extension,
motion; these qualities are all complete in themselves,
and never point out any other event which may result
from them. The scenes of the universe are continual∣ly
shifting, and one object follows another in an unin∣terrupted
succession; but the power or force, which
actuates the whole machine, is intirely concealed from
us, and never discovers itself in any of the sensible qua∣lities
of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a con∣stant
attendant of flame; but what is the connexion
between them, we have no room so much as to con∣jecture
or imagine. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that
the idea of power can be derived from the contem∣plation
of bodies, in single instances of their operation;
because no bodies ever discover any power, which can
be the original of this idea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. LOCKE, in his chapter of power, says that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power. But no reasoning can ever give us a new, original, simple idea; as this philosopher himself confesses. This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102"/>
SINCE, therefore, external objects, as they appear
to the senses, give us no idea of power or necessary
connexion, by their operations in particular instances,
let us see, whether this idea be derived from re∣flection
on the operations of our own minds, and be
copied from any internal impression. It may be said,
that we are every moment conscious of power in our
own minds; while we feel, that, by the simple com∣mand
of our will, we can move the organs of our
body, or direct the faculties of our minds, in their
operation. An act of volition produces motion in our
limbs, or raises a new idea in our imagination. This
influence of the will we know by consciousness.
Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and
are certain, that we ourselves and all other intelligent
beings are possessed of power. This idea, then, is an
idea of reflection, since it arises from reflecting on the
operations of our own minds, and on the command
which is exercised by will, both over the organs of
the body and faculties of the mind.</P>
<P>WE shall proceed to examine this pretension; and
first with regard to the influence of volition over the
organs of the body. This influence, we may observe,
<PB N="104" REF="103"/>
is a fact, which, like all other natural operations, can
be known only by experience, and can never be
foreseen from any apparent energy or power in
the cause, which connects it with the effect, and ren∣ders
the one an insallible consequence of the other.
The motion of our body follows upon the command
of our will. Of this we are every moment con∣scious:
But the means, by which this is effected; the
energy, by which the will performs so extraordinary
an operation; of this we are so far from being imme∣diately
conscious, that it must for ever escape our most
diligent inquiry.</P>
<P>FOR <HI>first;</HI> is there any principle in all nature more
mysterious than the union of soul with body; by
which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an
influence over a material one, that the most refined
thought is able to actuate the grossest matter? Were
we empowered, by a secret wish, to remove moun∣tains,
or control the planets in their orbit; this exten∣sive
authority would not be more extraordinary, nor
more beyond our comprehension. But if by consci∣ousness
we perceived any power or energy in the will,
we must know this power; we must know its con∣nexion
with the effect; we must know the secret
union of soul and body, and the nature of both these
substances: by which the one is able to operate, in so
many instances, upon the other.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="104"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> We are not able to move all the organs
of the body with a like authority; tho' we cannot as∣sign
any other reason, besides experience, for so re∣markable
a difference betwixt one and the other.
Why has the will an influence over the tongue and
fingers, and not over the heart or liver? This ques∣tion
would never embarrass us, were we conscious of a
power in the former case, and not in the latter. We
should then perceive, independent of experience, why
the authority of will over the organs of the body is
circumscribed within such particular limits. Being in
that case fully acquainted with the power or force, by
which it operates, we should also know, why its in∣fluence
reaches precisely to such boundaries, and no
farther.</P>
<P>A MAN, struck suddenly with a palsy in the leg or
arm, or who had newly lost those members, frequently
endeavours, at first to move them, and employ them
in their usual offices. Here he is as much conscious
of power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect
health is conscious of power to actuate any member
which remains in its natural state and condition. But
consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither
in the one case nor in the other, are we ever conscious
of any power. We learn the influence of our will
from experience alone. And experience only teaches
us, how one event constantly follows another, without
<PB N="106" REF="105"/>
instructing us in the secret connexion, which binds
them together, and renders them inseparable.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> WE learn from anatomy, that the imme∣diate
object of power in voluntary motion, is not the
member itself which is moved, but certain muscles,
and nerves, and animal spirits, and perhaps, some∣thing
still more minute and more unknown, thro'
which the motion is successively propagated, ere it
reach the member itself whose motion is the imme∣diate
object of volition. Can there be a more certain
proof, that the power, by which this whole operation
is performed, so far from being directly and fully
known by an inward sentiment or consciousness, is, to
the last degree, mysterious and unintelligible? Here
the mind wills a certain event: Immediately, another
event, unknown to ourselves, and totally different
from that intended, is produced: This event produces
another, equally unknown: Till at last, thro' a long
succession, the desired event is produced. But if the
original power were felt, it must be known: Were it
known, its effect must also be known; since all power
is relative to its effect. And <HI>vice versa,</HI> if the effect be
not known, the power cannot be known or felt. How
indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our
limbs, when we have no such power; but only that to
move certain animal spirits, which, tho' they produce
at last the motion of our limbs, yet operate in such a
manner as is wholly beyond our comprehension?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="106"/>
WE may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I
hope, without any temerity, tho' with assurance; that
our idea of power is not copied from any sentiment or
consciousness of power within ourselves, when we give
rise to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their
proper use and office. That their motion follows the
command of the will is a matter of common expe∣rience,
like other natural events: But the power or
energy, by which this is effected, like that in other
natural events, is unknown and inconceivable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be pretended, that the resistance which we meet with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and power. 'Tis this <HI>nisus</HI> or strong endeavour, of which we are conscious, that is the original impression from which this idea is copied. But, <HI>first,</HI> we attribute power to a vast number of objects, where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets with any resis∣tance; to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect follows imme∣diately upon the will, without any exertion or summoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not capable of this senti∣ment. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This sentiment of an endeavour to overcome resistance has no known connexion with any event: What fol∣lows it, we know by experience; but could not know it <HI>à priori.</HI> It must, however, be confessed, that the animal <HI>nisus,</HI> which we experience, tho' it can afford no accurate precise idea of power, enters very much into that vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it. See p. 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL We then assert, that we are conscious of a
power or energy in our own minds, when, by an act
<PB N="108" REF="107"/>
or command of our will, we raise up a new idea, fix
the mind to a contemplation of it, turn it on all sides,
and at last dismiss it for some other idea, when we
think, that we have surveyed it with sufficient accu∣racy?
I believe the same arguments will prove, that
even this command of the will gives us no real idea of
force or energy.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT must be allowed, that when we know a
power, we know that very circumstance in the cause,
by which it is enabled to produce the effect: For
these are supposed to be synonimous. We must,
therefore, know both the cause and effect, and the re∣lation
between them. But do we pretend to be ac∣quainted
with the nature of the human soul and the
nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to pro∣duce
the other? This is a real creation; a production
of something out of nothing: Which implies a power
so great, that it may seem, at first sight, beyond the
reach of any being, less than infinite. At least it must
be owned, that such a power is not felt, nor known,
nor even conceivable by the mind. We only feel the
event, <HI>viz.</HI> The existence of an idea, confequent to a
command of the will: But the manner, in which this
operation is performed; the power, by which it is pro∣duced;
is intirely beyond our comprehension.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE command of the mind over itself is
limited, as well as its command over the body; and
<PB N="109" REF="108"/>
these limits are not known by reason, or any acquaint∣ance
with the nature of the cause and effect; but on∣ly
by experience and observation, as in all other na∣tural
events and in the operation of external objects.
Our authority over our sentiments and passions is
much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the
latter authority is circumscribed within very narrow
boundaries. Will any one pretend to assign the ulti∣mate
reason of these boundaries, or show why the
power is deficient in one case and not in another?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THIS self-command is very different at
different times. A man in health possesses more of
it, than one languishing with sickness. We are more
master of our thoughts in the morning than in the
evening: Fasting, than after a full meal. Can we
give any reason for these variations, except experience?
Where then is the power, of which we pretend to be
conscious? Is there not here, either in a spiritual or
material substance, or both, some secret mechanism or
structure of parts, upon which the effect depends, and
which being intirely unknown to us, renders the pow∣er
or energy of the will equally unknown and incom∣prehensible?</P>
<P>VOLITION
is surely an act of the mind, with which
we are sufficiently acquainted. Reflect upon it. Con∣sider
it on all sides. Do you find any thing in it like
this creative power, by which it raises from nothing a
<PB N="110" REF="109"/>
new idea, and with a kind of FIAT, imitates the omni∣potence
of its Maker, if I may be allowed so to speak,
who called forth into existence all the various scenes
of nature? So far from being conscious of this energy
in the will, it requires as certain experience, as that of
which we are possessed, to convince us, that such ex∣traordinary
effects do ever result from a simple act of
volition.</P>
<P>THE generality of mankind never find any diffi∣culty
in accounting for the more common and familiar
operations of nature; such as the descent of heavy
bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of ani∣mals,
or the nourishment of bodies by food: But sup∣pose,
that, in all these cases, they perceive the very
force or energy of the cause, by which it is connected
with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its opera∣tion.
They acquire, by long habit, such a turn of
mind, that, upon the appearance of the cause, they
immediately expect with assurance its usual attendant,
and hardly conceive it possible, that any other event
could result from it. 'Tis only on the discovery of
extraordinary phaenomena, such as earthquakes, pes∣tilence,
and prodigies of any kind, that they find
themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause, and to ex∣plain
the manner in which the effect is produced by
it. 'Tis usual for men, in such difficulties, to have
recourse to some invisible, intelligent principle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>, as
<PB N="111" REF="110"/>
the immediate cause of that event, which surprises
them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted
for from the common powers of nature. But philo∣sophers,
who carry their scrutiny a little farther, im∣mediately
perceive, that, even in the most familiar
events, the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as
in the most unusual, and that we only learn by expe∣rience
the frequent CONJUNCTION of objects, with∣out
being ever able to comprehend any thing like
CONNEXION between them. Here then, many philo∣sophers
think themselves obliged by reason to have
recourse, on all occasions, to the same principle, which
the vulgar never appeal to but in cases, that appear
miraculous and supernatural. They acknowledge
mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate
and original cause of all things, but the immediate
and sole cause of every event, which appears in na∣ture.
They pretend, that those objects, which are
commonly denominated <HI>causes,</HI> are in reality nothing
but <HI>occasions;</HI> and that the true and direct principle of
every effect is not any power or force in nature, but a
volition of the Supreme Being, who wills, that such
particular objects should, for ever, be conjoined with
each other. Instead of saying, that one billiard-ball
moves another, by a force which it has derived from
the author of nature; 'tis the Deity himself, they say,
who, by a particular volition, moves the second ball,
being determined to this operation by the impulse of
the first ball; in consequence of those general laws,
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
which he has laid down to himself in the government
of the universe. But philosophers, advancing still in
their inquiries, discover, that, as we are totally igno∣rant
of the power on which depends the mutual ope∣ration
of bodies, we are no less ignorant of that power,
on which depends the operation of mind on body, or
of body on mind; nor are we able, either from our
senses or consciousness, to assign the ultimate principle
in one case, more than in the other. The same ig∣norance,
therefore, reduces them to the same conclu∣sion.
They assert, that the Deity is the immediate
cause of the union between soul and body, and that
they are not the organs of sense, which, being agita∣ted
by external objects, produce sensations in the
mind; but that 'tis a particular volition of our omni∣potent
Maker, which excites such a sensation, in con∣sequence
of such a motion in the organ. In like
manner, it is not any energy in the will, that produ∣ces
local motion in our members: 'Tis God himself,
who is pleased to second our will, in itself impotent,
and to command that motion, which we erroneously
attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do
philosophers stop at this conclusion. They some∣times
extend the same inference to the mind itself, in
its internal operations. Our mental vision or concep∣tion
of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us
by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our
thoughts to any object, and raise up its image in the
fancy; it is not the will which creates that idea;
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
'Tis the universal Creator of all things, who discovers
it to the mind, and renders it present to us.</P>
<P>THUS, according to these philosophers, every thing
is full of God. Not contented with the principle,
that nothing exists but by his will, that nothing pos∣sesses
any power but by his concession: They rob na∣ture,
and all created beings, of every power, in order
to render their dependance on the Deity still more
sensible and immediate. They consider not, that by
this theory they diminish, instead of magnifying, the
grandeur of those attributes, which they affect so
much to celebrate. It argues surely more power in
the Deity to delegate a certain degree of power to in∣ferior
creatures, than to operate every thing by his
own immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to
contrive at first the fabric of the world with such per∣fect
foresight, that, of itself, and by its proper opera∣tion,
it may serve all the purposes of providence, than
if the great Creator were obliged every moment to ad∣just
its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels
of that stupendous machine.</P>
<P>BUT if we would have a more a philosophical confu∣tation
of this theory, perhaps the two following re∣flections
may suffice.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT seems to me, that this theory of the uni∣versal
energy and operation of the Supreme Being, is
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man who
is sufficiently apprized of the weakness of human reason,
and the narrow limits, to which it is confined in all its
operations. Tho' the chain of arguments, which
conduct to it, were ever so logical, there must arise a
strong suspicion, if not an absolute assurance, that it
has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties,
when it leads to conclusions so extraordinary, and so
remote from common life and experience. We are
got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last
steps of our theory; and <HI>there</HI> we have no reason to
trust our common methods of argument, or think that
our usual analogies and probabilities have any autho∣rity.
Our line is too short to fathom such immense
abysses. And however we may flatter ourselves, that
we are guided, in every step which we take, by a kind
of verisimilitude and experience; we may be assured,
that this fancied experience has no authority when we
thus apply it to subjects that lie intirely out of the
sphere of experience. But on this we shall have oc∣casion
to touch afterwards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Section XII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I cannot perceive any force in the argu∣ments
on which this theory is founded. We are ig∣norant,
tis true, of the manner in which bodies ope∣rate
on each other: Their force or energy is intirely
incomprehensible. But are we not equally ignorant
of the manner or force, by which a mind, even the
<PB N="115" REF="114"/>
supreme mind, operates either on itself or on body?
Whence, I beseech you, do we acquire any idea of it?
We have no sentiment or consciousness of this power
in ourselves. We have no idea of the Supreme Being
but what we learn from reflection on our own facul∣ties.
Were our ignorance, therefore, a good reason
for rejecting any thing, we should be led into that
principle of denying all energy in the Supreme Being
as much as in the grossest matter. We surely com
prehend as little the operations of one as of the other.
Is it more difficult to conceive, that motion may
arise from impulse, than that it may arise from voli∣tion?
All we know is our profound ignorance in both
cases<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I need not examine at length the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> which is so much talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter. We find by experience, that a body at rest or in mo∣tion continues for ever in its present state, till put from it by some new cause: And that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as it acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a <HI>vis inertiae,</HI> we only mark these facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of all force or energy; tho' some of his followers have endeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the contrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an etherial ac∣tive fluid to explain his universal attraction; tho' he was so cautious and modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be insisted on, without more experiments. I must con∣fess, that there is something in the fate of opinions a little ex∣traordinary. DES-CARTES insinuated that doctrine of the uni∣versal and sole efficacy of the Deity, without insisting on it. MALEERANCHE and other CARTESIANS made it the foun∣dation of all their philosophy. It had, however, no authority in ENGLAND. LOCKE, CLARKE, and CUDWORTH, never so much as take notice of it, but supposed all along, that matter has a real, tho' subordinate and derived power. By what means has it become so prevalent among our modern metaphy∣sicians?</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="115"/>
BUT to hasten to a conclusion of this argument,
which is already drawn out to too great a length:
We have sought in vain for an idea of power or neces∣sary
connexion, in all the sources from which we could
suppose it to be derived. It appears, that, in single
instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by
our utmost scrutiny, discover any thing but one event
following another; without being able to comprehend
any force or power, by which the cause operates, or
any connexion between it and its supposed effect.
The same difficulty occurs in contemplating the ope∣rations
of mind on body; where we observe the mo∣tion
of the latter to follow upon the volition of the
former; but are not able to observe nor conceive the
<PB N="117" REF="116"/>
tye, which binds together the motion and volition, or
the energy by which the mind produces this effect.
The authority of the will over its own faculties and
ideas is not a whit more comprehensible: So that,
upon the whole, there appears not, thro' all nature,
any one instance of connexion, which is conceivable
by us. All events seem intirely loose and separate.
One event follows another; but we never can observe
any tye between them. They seem <HI>conjoined,</HI> but
never <HI>connected.</HI> And as we can have no idea of any
thing, which never appeared to our outward sense or
inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion <HI>seems</HI> to be,
that we have no idea of connexion or power at all,
and that these words are absolutely without any mean∣ing,
when employed either in philosophical reason∣ings,
or common life.</P>
<P>BUT there still remains one method of avoiding this
conclusion, and one source which we have not yet ex∣amined.
When any natural object or event is pre∣sented,
'tis impossible for us, by any sagacity or pe∣netration,
to discover, or even conjecture, without ex∣perience,
what event will result from it, or to carry
our foresight beyond that object, which is immediate∣ly
present to the memory and senses. Even after one
instance or experiment, where we have observed a
particular event to follow upon another, we are not
intitled to form a general rule, or foretel what will
happen in like cases; it being justly esteemed an un∣pardonable
<PB N="118" REF="117"/>
temerity to judge of the whole course of
nature from one single experiment, however accurate
or certain. But when one particular species of event
has always, in all instances, been conjoined with ano∣ther,
we make no longer any scruple to foretel the
one upon the appearance of the other, and to employ
that reasoning, which can alone assure us of any mat∣ter
of fact or existence. We then call the one object,
<HI>Cause;</HI> and the other, <HI>Effect.</HI> We suppose, that there
is some connexion between them; some power in the
one, by which it infallibly produces the other, and o∣perates
with the greatest certainty and strongest ne∣cessity.</P>
<P>IT
appears, then, that this idea of a necessary con∣nexion
from events arises from a number of similar
instances, which occur, of the constant conjunction of
these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by
any one of these instances, surveyed in all possible
lights and positions. But there is nothing in a num∣ber
of instances, different from every single instance,
which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only,
that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is
carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to
expect its usual attendant, and to believe, that it will
exist. This connexion, therefore, which we <HI>feel</HI> in
the mind, or customary transition of the imagination
from one object to its usual attendant, is the senti∣ment
or impression, from which we form the idea of
<PB N="119" REF="118"/>
power or necessary connexion. Nothing farther is in
the case. Contemplate the subject on all sides, you
will never find any other origin of this idea. This is
the sole difference between one instance, from which
we never can receive the idea of connexion, and a
number of similar instances, by which it is suggested.
The first time a man saw the communication of mo∣tion
by impulse, as by the shock of two billiard balls,
he could not pronounce that the one event was <HI>con∣nected;</HI>
but only that it was <HI>conjoined</HI> with the other.
After he has observed several instances of this nature,
he then pronounces them to be <HI>connected.</HI> What al∣teration
has happened to give rise to this new idea of
<HI>connexion?</HI> Nothing but that he now <HI>feels</HI> these events
to be <HI>connected</HI> in his imagination, and can readily
foretel the existence of one from the appearance of
the other. When we say, therefore, that one object
is connected with another, we mean only, that they
have acquired a connexion in our thoughts, and give
rise to this inference, by which they become proofs
of each other's existence: A conclusion; which is
somewhat extraordinary; but which seems founded
on sufficient evidence. Nor will its evidence be
weakned by any general diffidence of the under∣standing,
or sceptical suspicion concerning every con∣clusion,
which is new and extraordinary. No con∣clusions
can be more agreeable to scepticism than such
as make discoveries concerning the weakness and nar∣row
limits of human reason and capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="119"/>
AND what stronger instance can be produced of the
surprising ignorance and weakness of the understand∣ing,
than the present? For surely, if there be any re∣lation
among objects, which it imports us to know
perfectly, 'tis that of cause and effect. On this are
founded all our reasonings concerning matter of fact
or existence. By means of it alone we attain any as∣surance
concerning objects which are removed from
the present testimony of our memory and senses.
The only immediate utility of all sciences, is to teach
us, how to control and regulate future events by their
causes. Our thoughts and inquiries are, therefore,
every moment, employed about this relation. And
yet so imperfect are the ideas which we form concern∣ing
it, that 'tis impossible to give any just definition
of cause, except what is drawn from something extra∣neous
and foreign to it. Similar objects are always
conjoined with similar. Of this we have experience.
Suitable to this experience, therefore, we may define a
cause to be <HI>an object, followed by another, and where
all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by ob∣jects
similar to the second.</HI> Or in other words, <HI>where,
if the first object had not been, the second never had ex∣isted.</HI>
The appearance of a cause always conveys the
mind, by a customary transition, to the idea of the ef∣fect.
Of this also we have experience. We may,
therefore, suitable to this experience, form another de∣finition
of cause, and call it, <HI>an object followed by an∣other,
and whose appearance always conveys the thought
<PB N="121" REF="120"/>
to that other.</HI> But tho' both these definitions be
drawn from circumstances foreign to the cause, we
cannot remedy this inconvenience, or attain any
more perfect definition, which may point out that
circumstance in the cause, which gives it a connexion
with its effect. We have no idea of this connexion;
nor even any distinct notion what it is we desire to
know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We
say, for instance, that the vibration of this string is the
cause of this particular sound. But what do we mean
by that affirmation? We either mean, <HI>that this vibra∣tion
is followed by this sound, and that all similar vibra∣tions
have been followed by similar sounds: Or, that
this vibration is followed by this sound, and that upon
the appearance of one, the mind anticipates the senses,
and forms immediately an idea of the other.</HI> We may
consider the relation of cause and effect in either of
these two lights; but beyond these, we have no idea
of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>According to these explications and definitions, the idea of <HI>power</HI> is relative as much as that of <HI>cause;</HI> and both have a re∣ference to an effect, or some other event constantly conjoined with the former. When we consider the <HI>unknown</HI> circumstance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And accordingly, 'tis allowed by all philosophers, that the effect is the measure of the power. But if they had any idea of power, as it is in it∣self, why could not they measure it in itself? The dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity, or the square of its velocity; this dispute, I say, needed not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or unequal times; but by a di∣rect mensuration and comparison.</P>
<P>As to the frequent use of the words, Force, Power, Energy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which every where occur in common conversation, as well as in philosophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any instance, with the connecting principle between cause and effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one thing by another. These words, as commonly used, have very loose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very un∣certain and confused. No animal can put external bodies in motion without the sentiment of a <HI>nisus</HI> or endeavour; and every animal has a sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow of an external object, that is in motion. These sensations, which are merely animal, and from which we can <HI>à priori</HI> draw no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and to suppose, that they have some such feelings, whenever they transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of commu∣nicated motion, we consider only the constant experienced con∣junction of the events; and as we <HI>feel</HI> a customary connexion between the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every in∣ternal sensation, which they occasion.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="121"/>
To recapitulate, therefore, the reasonings of this
section: Every idea is copied from some preceding
impression or sentiment; and where we cannot find
any impression, we may be certain that there is no
idea. In all single instances of the operation of bodies
<PB N="123" REF="122"/>
or minds, there is nothing that produces any impres∣sion,
nor consequently can suggest any idea of power
or necessary connexion. But when many uniform in∣stances
appear, and the same object is always follow∣ed
by the same event; we then begin to entertain the
notion of cause and connexion. We then <HI>feel</HI> a new
sentiment or impression, <HI>viz.</HI> a customary connexion
in the thought or imagination between one object and
its usual attendant; and this sentiment is the original
of that idea which we seek for. For as this idea arises
from a number of similar instances, and not from any
single instance; it must arise from that circumstance,
in which the number of instances differ from every in∣dividual
instance. But this customary connexion or
transition of the imagination is the only circumstance,
in which they differ. In every other particular they
are alike. The first instance which we saw of motion,
communicated by the shock of two billiard-balls (to re∣turn
to this obvious instance) is exactly similar to any
instance that may, at present, occur to us; except on∣ly,
that we could not, at first, <HI>infer</HI> one event from the
other; which we are enabled to do at present, after so
long a course of uniform experience. I know not, if
the reader will readily apprehend this reasoning. I
am afraid, that, should I multiply words about it, or
throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only
become more obscure and intricate. In all abstract
reasonings, there is one point of view, which, if we
<PB N="124" REF="123"/>
can happily hit, we shall go farther towards illustrating
the subject, than by all the eloquence and copious
expression in the world. This we should endeavour
to attain, and reserve the flowers of rhetoric for sub∣jects,
which are more adapted to them.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>IT might reasonably be expected, in questions,
which have been canvassed and disputed with great
eagerness since the first origin of science and philoso∣phy,
that the meaning of all the terms, at least,
should have been agreed upon among the disputants;
and our enquiries, in the course of two thousand years,
been able to pass from words to the true and real sub∣ject
of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to
give exact definitions of the terms employed in reason∣ing,
and make these definitions, not the mere sound of
words, the object of future scrutiny and examination?
But if we consider the matter more narrowly, we shall
be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From
that circumstance alone, that a controversy has been
long kept on foot, and remains still undecided, we
may presume, that there is some ambiguity in the ex∣pression,
and that the disputants affix different ideas
<PB N="126" REF="125"/>
to the terms employed in the controversy. For as the
faculties of the soul are supposed to be naturally alike
in every individual; otherwise nothing could be more
fruitless than to reason or dispute together; it were
impossible, if men affix the same ideas to their terms,
that they could so long form different opinions of the
same subject; especially when they communicate their
views, and each party turn themselves on all sides, in
search of arguments, which may give them the vic∣tory
over their antagonists. 'Tis ture; if men at∣tempt
the discussion of questions, which lie entirely
beyond the reach of human capacity, such as those
concerning the origin of worlds, or the oeconomy of
the intellectual system or region of spirits, they may
long beat the air in their fruitless contests, and never
arrive at any determinate conclusion. But if the
question regard any subject of common life and expe∣rience;
nothing, one would think, could preserve
the dispute so long undecided, but some ambiguous
expressions, which keep the antagonists still at a dis∣tance,
and hinder them from grappling with each
other.</P>
<P>THIS has been the case in the long disputed ques∣tion
concerning liberty and necessity; and to so re∣markable
a degree, that, if I be not much mistaken,
we shall find all mankind, both learned and ignorant,
to have been always of the same opinion with regard
to that subject, and that a few intelligible definitions
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
would immediately have put an end to the whole
controversy. I own, that this dispute has been so
much canvassed, on all hands, and has led philoso∣phers
into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry, that
'tis no wonder if a sensible and polite reader indulge
his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal
of such a question, from which he can expect neither
instruction nor entertainment. But the state of the
argument here proposed may, perhaps, serve to re∣new
his attention; as it has more novelty, promises
at least some decision of the controversy, and will not
much disturb his ease, by any intricate or obscure
reasoning.</P>
<P>I HOPE, therefore, to make it appear, that all men
have ever agreed in the doctrines both of necessity and
of liberty, according to any reasonable sense, which
can be put on these terms; and that the whole con∣troversy
has hitherto turned merely upon words. We
shall begin with examining the doctrine of necessity.</P>
<P>'TIS universally allowed, that matter, in all its
operations, is actuated by a necessary force, and that
every natural effect is so precisely determined by the
energy of its cause, that no other effect, in such
particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted
from the operation of that cause. The degree and
direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,
prescribed with such exactness, that a living creature
<PB N="128" REF="127"/>
may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies, as
motion in any other degree or direction, than what is
actually produced by it Would we, therefore, form
a just and precise idea of <HI>necessity,</HI> we must consider,
whence that idea arises, when we apply it to the ope∣ration
of bodies.</P>
<P>IT seems evident, that, if all the scenes of nature
were shifted continually in such a manner, that no
two events bore any resemblance to each other, but
every object was entirely new, without any similitude
to whatever had been seen before, we should never,
in that case, have attained the least idea of necessity,
or of a connexion among these objects. We might
say, upon such a supposition, that one object or event
has followed another; not that one was produced by
the other. The relation of cause and effect must be
utterly unknown to mankind. Inference and reason∣ing
concerning the operations of nature would, from
that moment, be at an end; and the memory and
senses remain the only canals, by which the know∣lege
of any real existence could possibly have access to
the mind. Our idea, therefore, of necessity and cau∣sation
arises entirely from that uniformity, observable
in the operations of nature; where similar objects are
constantly conjoined together, and the mind is deter∣mined
by custom to infer the one from the appear∣ance
of the other. These two circumstances form
the whole of that necessity, which we ascribe to mat∣ter.
<PB N="129" REF="128"/>
Beyond the constant <HI>conjunction</HI> of similar ob∣jects,
and the consequent <HI>inference</HI> from one to the
other, we have no notion of any necessity, or con∣nexion.</P>
<P>IF
it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever
allowed, without any doubt or hesitation, that these
two circumstances take place in the voluntary actions
of men, and in the operations of the mind; it must
follow, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc∣trine
of necessity, and that they have hitherto dis∣puted,
merely for not understanding each other.</P>
<P>As to the first circumstance, the constant and regular
conjunction of similar events; we may possibly satisfy
ourselves by the following considerations. It is uni∣versally
acknowledged, that there is a great uniformity
among the actions of men, in all nations and ages,
and that human nature remains still the same, in its
principles and operations. The same motives produce
always the same actions: The same events follow
from the same causes. Ambition, avarice, self love,
vanity, friendship, generosity, public spirit; these
passions, mixed in various degrees, and distributed
thro' society, have been, from the beginning of the
world, and still are, the sources of all the actions and
enterprizes, which have ever been observed among
mankind. Would you know the sentiments, incli∣nations,
and course of life of the GREEKS and RO∣MANS?
<PB N="130" REF="129"/>
Study well the temper and actions of the
FRENCH and ENGLISH. You cannot be much mis∣taken
in transferring to the former <HI>most</HI> of the obser∣vations,
which you have made with regard to the
latter. Mankind are so much the same, in all times
and places, that history informs us of nothing new or
strange in this particular. Its chief use if only to dis∣cover
the constant and universal principles of human
nature, by shewing men in all varieties of circum∣stances
and situations, and furnishing us with mate∣rials,
from which we may form our observations, and
become acquainted with the regular springs of human
action and behaviour. These records of wars, in∣trigues,
factions, and revolutions, are so many col∣lections
of experiments, by which the politician or
moral philosopher fixes the principles of his science;
in the same manner as the physician or natural philo∣sopher
becomes acquainted with the nature of plants,
minerals, and other external objects, by the experi∣ments,
which he forms concerning them. Nor are
the earth, water, and other elements, examined by
ARISTOTLE, and HIPPOCRATES, more like to those,
which at present lie under our observation, than the
men, described by POLYBIUS and TACITUS, are to
those who now govern the world.</P>
<P>SHOULD a traveller, returning from a far country,
bring us an account of men, entirely different from
any, with whom we were ever acquainted; men, who
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
were entirely divested of avarice, ambition, or re∣venge;
who knew no pleasure but friendship, gene∣rosity,
and publick spirit; we should immediately,
from these circumstances, detect the falshood, and
prove him a liar, with the same certainty as if he
had stuffed his narration with stories of centaurs and
dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we would
explode any forgery in history, we cannot make use
of a more convincing argument; than to prove, that
the actions, ascribed to any person, are directly con∣trary
to the course of nature, and that no human mo∣tives,
in such circumstances, could ever induce him
to such a conduct. The veracity of QUINTUS CUR∣TIUS
is as suspicious, when he describes the superna∣tural
courage of ALEXANDER, by which he was hur∣ried
on singly to attack multitudes, as when he de∣scribes
his supernatural force and activity, by which
he was able to resist them. So readily and univer∣sally
do we acknowlege an uniformity in human mo∣tives
and actions as well as in the operations of
body.</P>
<P>HENCE likewise the benefit of that experience, ac∣quired
by long life and a variety of business and com∣pany,
in order to instruct us in the principles of hu∣man
nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well
as speculation. By means of this guide, we mount
up to the knowlege of mens inclinations and motives,
from their actions, expressions, and even gestures;
<PB N="132" REF="131"/>
and again, descend to the interpretation of their ac∣tions
from our knowlege of their motives and inclina∣tions.
The general observations, treasured up by a
course of experience, give us the clue of human na∣ture,
and teaches us to unravel all its intricacies. Pre∣texts
and appearances no longer deceive us. Public
declarations pass for the specious colouring of a cause.
And tho' virtue and honour be allowed their proper
weight and authority, that perfect disinterestedness, so
often pretended, is never expected in multitudes and
parties; seldom in their leaders; and scarcely even in
individuals of any rank or station. But were there no
uniformity in human actions, and were every experi∣ment
which we could form of this kind irregular and
anomolous, it were impossible to collect any general
observations concerning mankind; and no experience,
however accurately digested by reflection, would ever
serve to any purpose. Why is the antient husband∣man
more skilful in his calling than the young be∣ginner,
but because there is a certain uniformity in
the operation of the sun, rain, and earth, towards
the production of vegetables; and experience teaches
the old practitioner the rules, by which this operation
is governed and directed?</P>
<P>WE must not, however, expect, that this unifor∣mity
of human actions should be carried to such a
length, as that all men in the same circumstances,
should always act precisely in the same manner, with∣out
<PB N="133" REF="132"/>
any allowance for the diversity of characters, pre∣judices,
and opinions. Such a uniformity, in every
particular is found in no part of nature. On the con∣trary,
from observing the variety of conduct in diffe∣rent
men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of
maxims, which still suppose a degree of uniformity
and regularity.</P>
<P>ARE the manners of men different in different ages
and countries? We learn thence the great force of
custom and education, which mould the human mind
from its infancy, and form it into a fixed and esta∣blished
character. Is the behaviour and conduct of
the one sex very unlike that of the other? 'Tis from
thence we become acquainted with the different cha∣racters,
which nature has impressed upon the sexes,
and which she preserves with constancy and regula∣rity.
Are the actions of the same person much di∣versified
in the different periods of his life, from in∣fancy
to old age? This affords room for many gene∣ral
observations concerning the gradual change of our
sentiments and inclinations, and the different maxims,
which prevail in the different ages of human crea∣tures.
Even the characters which are peculiar to each
individual, have an uniformity in their influence, other∣wise
our acquaintance with the persons, and our ob∣servation
of their conduct could never teach us their
dispositions, nor serve to direct our behaviour with
regard to them.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="133"/>
I GRANT it possible to find some actions, which
seem to have no regular connexion with any known
motives, and are exceptions to all the measures of
conduct, which have ever been established for the go∣vernment
of men. But if we would willingly know,
what judgment should be formed of such irregular
and extraordinary actions; we may consider the sen∣timents
that are commonly entertained with regard to
those irregular events, which appear in the course of
nature, and the operations of external objects. All
causes are not conjoined to their usual effects, with
like uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead
matter, may be disappointed of his aim as well as
the politician, who directs the conduct of sensible and
intelligent agents.</P>
<P>THE vulgar, who take things according to their
first appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to
such an uncertainty in the causes as makes the latter
often fail of their usual influence; tho' they meet
with no impediment in their operation. But philoso∣phers,
observing, that almost in every part of nature
there is contained a vast variety of springs and prin∣ciples,
which are hid, by reason of their minuteness
or remoteness, find, that 'tis at least possible the con∣trariety
of events may not proceed from any contin∣gency
in the cause, but from the secret operation of
contrary causes. This possibility is converted into cer∣tainty
by farther observation, when they remark,
<PB N="135" REF="134"/>
that, upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects
always betrays a contrariety of causes, and proceeds
from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give
no better reason for the stopping of any clock or
watch than to say that it commonly does not not go
right: But an artizan easily perceives, that the same
force in the spring or pendulum has always the same
influence on the wheels; but fails of its usual effect,
perhaps by reason of a grain of dust, which puts a
stop to the whole movement. From the observation
of several parallel instances, philosophers form a
maxim, that the connexion between all causes and
effects is equally necessary, and that its seeming un∣certainty
in some instances proceeds from the secret
opposition of contrary causes.</P>
<P>THUS for instance, in the human body, when the
usual symptoms of health or sickness disappoint our
expectation; when medicines operate not with their
wonted powers; when irregular events follow from
any particular causes; the philosopher and physician
are not surprized at the matter, nor are ever tempted
to deny, in general, the necessity and uniformity of
those principles, by which the animal oeconomy is
conducted. They know, that a human body is a
mighty complicated machine: That many secret pow∣ers
lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our com∣prehension:
That to us it must often appear very un∣certain
in its operations: And that therefore the irre∣gular
<PB N="136" REF="135"/>
events, which outwardly discover themselves,
can be no proof, that the laws of nature are not ob∣served
with the greatest regularity in its internal ope∣rations
and government.</P>
<P>THE philosopher, if he be consistent, must apply
the same reasonings to the actions and volitions of
intelligent agents. The most irregular and unex∣pected
resolutions of men may frequently be accounted
for by those who know every particular circumstance
of their character and situation. A person of an
obliging disposition gives a peevish answer: But he
has the tooth-ake, or has not dined. A stupid fel∣low
discovers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage:
But he has met with a sudden piece of good fortune.
Or even when an action, as sometimes happens, can∣not
be particularly accounted for, either by the per∣son
himself or by others; we know, in general, that
the characters of men are, to a certain degree, incon∣stant
and irregular. This is, in a manner, the constant
character of human nature; tho' it be applicable, in
a more particular manner, to some persons, who have
no fixed rule for their conduct, but proceed in a con∣tinued
cours of caprice and inconstancy. The in∣ternal
principles and motives may operate in an uni∣form
manner, notwithstanding these seeming irregu∣larities;
in the same manner as the winds, rain,
clouds, and other variations of the weather are sup∣posed
<PB N="137" REF="136"/>
to be governed by steady principles; tho' not
easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, not only that the conjunction
between motives and voluntary actions is as regular
and uniform, as that between the cause and effect in
any part of nature; but also that this regular conjunc∣tion
has been universally acknowleged among man∣kind,
and has never been the subject of dispute, ei∣ther
in philosophy or common life. Now as it is
from past experience, that we draw all inferences con∣cerning
the future, and as we conclude, that objects
will always be conjoined together, which we find al∣ways
to have been conjoined; it may seem superflu∣ous
to prove, that this experienced uniformity in
human actions is the source of all the <HI>inferences,</HI>
which we form concerning them. But in order to
throw the argument into a greater variety of lights,
we shall also insist, tho' briefly, on this latter topic.</P>
<P>THE mutual dependance of men is so great, in all
societies, that scarce any human action is entirely
compleat in itself, or is performed without some re∣ference
to the actions of others, which are requisite
to make it answer fully the intention of the agent.
The poorest artificer, who labours alone, expects at
least the protection of the magistrate, to ensure the
enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He also ex∣pects,
that, when he carries his goods to market, and
<PB N="138" REF="137"/>
offers them at a reasonable price, he shall find buyers;
and shall be able, by the money he acquires, to en∣gage
others to supply him with those commodities,
which are requisite for his subsistence. In propor∣tion
as men extend their dealings, and render their
intercourse with others more complicated, they always
comprehend, in their schemes of life, a greater va∣riety
of voluntary actions, which they expect, from
their proper motives, to co-operate with their own.
In all these conclusions, they take their measures from
past experience, in the same manner as in their rea∣sonings
concerning external objects: and firmly be∣lieve,
that men, as well as all the elements, are to
continue, in their operations, the same, which they
have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons up∣on
the labour of his servants, for the execution of
any work, as much as upon the tools, which he em∣ploys,
and would be equally surprized, were his ex∣pectations
disappointed. In short, this experimental
inference and reasoning concerning the actions of
others enters so much into human life, that no man,
while awake, is ever a moment without employing
it. Have we not reason, therefore, to affirm, that all
mankind have always agreed in the doctrine of ne∣cessity,
according to the foregoing definition and ex∣plication
of it?</P>
<P>NOR have philosophers ever entertained a different
opinion from the people in this particular. For not
<PB N="139" REF="138"/>
to mention, that almost every action of their life sup∣poses
that opinion; there are even few of the specu∣lative
parts of learning, to which it is not essential.
What would become of <HI>history,</HI> had we not a depen∣dence
on the veracity of the historian, according to
the experience, which we have had of mankind? How
could <HI>politics</HI> be a science, if laws and forms of go∣vernment
had not an uniform influence upon society?
Where would be the foundation of <HI>morals,</HI> if particu∣lar
characters had no certain nor determinate power
to produce particular sentiments, and if these senti∣ments
had no constant operations on actions? And
with what pretext could we employ our <HI>criticism</HI> upon
any poet or polite author, if we could not pronounce
the conduct and sentiments of his actors, either natu∣ral
or unnatural, to such characters, and in such cir∣cumstances?
It seems almost impossible, therefore,
to engage, either in science or action of any kind,
without acknowleging the doctrine of necessity, and
this <HI>inference</HI> from motives to voluntary actions; from
characters to conduct.</P>
<P>AND indeed, when we consider how aptly <HI>natural</HI>
and <HI>moral</HI> evidence link together, and form only one
chain of argument, we shall make no scruple to al∣low,
that they are of the same nature, and derived
from the same principles. A prisoner, who has nei∣ther
money nor interest, discovers the impossibility of
his escape, as well from the obstinacy of the gaoler,
<PB N="140" REF="139"/>
as from the walls and bars, with which he is sur∣rounded;
and in all attempts for his freedom, chuses
rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one,
than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The
same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees
his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity
of his guards, as from the operation of the ax or
wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas:
The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape;
the action of the executioner; the separation of the
head and body; bleeding, convulsive motions, and
death. Here is a connected chain of natural causes
and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no diffe∣rence
between them, in passing from one link to
another: Nor is less certain of the future event than
if it were connected with the objects present to the
memory or senses, by a train of causes, cemented to∣gether
by what we are pleased to call a <HI>physical</HI> neces∣sity.
The same experienced union has the same effect
on the mind, whether the united objects be motives,
volitions, and actions; or figure and motion. We
may change the names of things; but their nature
and their operation on the understanding never
change.</P>
<P>I HAVE frequently considered, what could possibly
be the reason, why all mankind, tho' they have ever
without hesitation, acknowleged the doctrine of ne∣cessity,
in their whole practice and reasoning, have
<PB N="141" REF="140"/>
yet discovered such a reluctance to acknowlege it in
words, and have rather shewn a propensity, in all
ages, to profess the contrary opinion. The matter,
I think, may be accounted for, after the following
manner. If we examine the operations of bodies and
the production of effects from their causes, we shall
find, that all our faculties can never carry us farther
in our knowlege of this relation, than barely to ob∣serve,
that particular objects are <HI>constantly conjoined</HI> to∣gether,
and that the mind is carried, by a <HI>customary
transition,</HI> from the appearance of one to the belief
of the other. But tho' this conclusion concerning
human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny
of this subject, men still entertain a strong propensity
to believe, that they penetrate farther into the powers
of nature, and perceive something like a necessary con∣nexion
between the cause and the effect. When again
they turn their reflections towards the operations of
their own minds, and <HI>feel</HI> no such connexion of the
motive and the action; they are apt, from thence, to
suppose, that there is a difference between the effects,
resulting from material force, and those which arise
from thought and intelligence. But being once con∣vinced,
that we know nothing farther of causation of
any kind, than merely the <HI>constant conjunction</HI> of ob∣jects,
and the consequent <HI>inference</HI> of the mind from
one to another, and finding, that these two circum∣stances
are universally acknowleged to have place in
voluntary actions; we may thence be more easily led
<PB N="142" REF="141"/>
to own the same necessity common to all causes. And
tho' this reasoning may contradict the systems of many
philosophers, in ascribing necessity to the determinati∣ons
of the will, we shall find, upon reflection, that they
dissent from it in words only, not in their real senti∣ments.
Necessity, according to the sense, in which
it is here taken, has never yet been rejected, nor can
ever, I think, be rejected by any philosopher. It may
only, perhaps, be pretended, that the mind can per∣ceive,
in the operations of matter, some farther con∣nexion
between the cause and effect; and a connexion
which has not place in the voluntary actions of in∣telligent
beings. Now whether it be so or not, can
only appear upon examination; and it is incumbent
on these philosophers to make good their assertion, by
defining or describing that necessity, and pointing it
out to us, in the operations of material causes.</P>
<P>IT would seem, indeed, that men begin at the
wrong end of this question concerning liberty and ne∣cessity,
when they enter upon it by examining the
faculties of the soul, the influence of the understand∣ing,
and the operations of the will. Let them first
discuss a more simple question, <HI>viz.</HI> the operations of
body and of brute unintelligent matter; and try whe∣ther
they can there form any idea of causation and
necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of ob∣jects,
and subsequent inference of the mind from one
to another. If these circumstances form, in reality,
<PB N="143" REF="142"/>
the whole of that necessity, which we can conceive
in matter, and if these circumstances be also univer∣sally
acknowleged to take place in the operations of
the mind, the dispute is at an end; or, at least, must
be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But as
long as we will rashly suppose, that we have some far∣ther
idea of necessity and causation in the operations
of external objects; at the same time, that we can
find nothing farther, in the voluntary actions of the
mind; there is no possibility of bringing the dispute
to any determinate issue, while we proceed upon so
erroneous a supposition. The only method of unde∣ceiving
us, is, to mount up higher; to examine the
narrow extent of science, when applied to mateiral
causes; and to convince ourselves, that all we know
of them, is, the constant conjunction and inference
above-mentioned. We may, perhaps, find, that 'tis
with difficulty we are induced to fix such narrow li∣mits
to human understanding: But we can afterwards
find no difficulty, when we come to apply this doc∣trine
to the actions of the will. For as 'tis evident,
that these have a regular conjunction with motives
and circumstances and characters, and as we always
draw inferences from the one to the other, we
must be obliged to acknowlege, in words, that ne∣cessity,
which we have already avowed, in every
deliberation of our lives, and in every step of our
conduct and behaviour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for, from another cause, viz. a false sensation or seeming expe∣rience which we have, or may have, of liberty or indifference, in many of our actions. The necessity of any action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly speaking, a quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may con∣sider the action; and it consists chiefly in the determination of his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some pre∣ceding objects; as liberty, when opposed to necessity, is nothing but the want of that determination, and a certain looseness or indifference, which we feel, in passing, or not passing, from the idea of one object to that of any succeeding one. Now we may observe, that, tho' in <HI>reflecting</HI> on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indifference, but are commonly able to infer them with considerable certainty from their motives, and from the dispositions of the agent; yet it frequently happens, that, in <HI>performing</HI> the actions themselves, we are sensible of something like it: And as all resembling objects are readily taken for each other, this has been employed as a demonstrative and even an intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel, that our actions are subject to our will, on most occasions; and imagine we feel, that the will itself is subject to nothing, because, when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel that it moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself, (or a <HI>Velleity,</HI> as it is called in the schools) even on that side, on which it did not settle. This image, or faint motion, we persuade ourselves, could, at that time, have been compleated into the thing itself; because, should that be denied, we find, upon a second trial, that, at present, it can. We consider not, that the fantastical desire of shewing liberty, is here the motive of our actions. And it seems certain, that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves, a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every circum∣stance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs of our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="143"/>
BUT to proceed in this reconciling project with re∣gard
to the question of liberty and necessity; the
<PB N="145" REF="144"/>
most contentious question, of metaphysics, the most
contentious science; it will not require many words to
prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doc∣trine
of liberty as well as in that of necessity, and
that the whole dispute, in this respect also, has been
hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liber∣ty,
when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot
surely mean, that actions have so little connexion
with motives, inclinations, and circumstances, that
the one does not follow with a certain degree of uni∣formity
from the other, and that the one affords no
inference, from which we can conclude the existence
of the other. For these are plain and acknowleged
matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean
<HI>a power of acting or not acting, according to the deter∣minations
of the will;</HI> that is, if we chuse to remain
at rest, we may; if we chuse to move, we also may.
Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to
belong to every body, who is not a prisoner and in
chains. Here then is no subject of dispute.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="145"/>
WHATEVER definition we may give of liberty, we
should be careful to observe two requisite circum∣stances;
<HI>first,</HI> that it be consistent with plain matter
of fact; <HI>secondly,</HI> that it be consistent with itself. If
we observe these circumstances, and render our defi∣nition
intelligible, I am persuaded that all mankind
will be found of one opinion with regard to it.</P>
<P>'TIS universally allowed, that nothing exists with∣out
a cause of its existence, and that chance, when
strictly examined, is a mere negative word, and means
not any real power, which has, any where, a being
in nature. But 'tis pretended that some causes are ne∣cessary,
and some are not necessary. Here then is
the admirable advantage of definitions. Let any one
<HI>define</HI> a cause, without comprehending, as a part of
the definition, a <HI>necessary connexion</HI> with its effect;
and let him shew distinctly the origin of the idea, ex∣pressed
by the definition; and I shall frankly give up
the whole controversy. But if the foregoing explica∣tion
of the matter be received, this must be absolutely
impracticable. Had not objects a regular conjunction
with each other, we should never have entertained any
notion of cause and effect; and this regular conjunc∣tion
produces that inference of the understanding,
which is the only connexion, that we can have any
comprehension of. Whoever attempts a definition of
cause, exclusive of these circumstances, will be obliged,
either to employ unintelligible terms, or such as are
<PB N="147" REF="146"/>
synonimous to the term, which he endeavours to de∣fine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus if a cause be defined, <HI>that which produces any thing;</HI> 'tis easy to observe, that <HI>producing</HI> is synonimous to <HI>causing.</HI> In like manner, if a cause be defined, <HI>that by which any thing ex∣ists;</HI> this is liable to the same objection. For what is meant by these words, <HI>by which?</HI> Had it been said, that a cause is <HI>that</HI> after which <HI>any thing constantly exists;</HI> we should have understood the terms. For this is, indeed, all we know of the matter. And this constancy forms the very essence of necessity, nor have we any other idea of it.</NOTE>. And if the definition above-mentioned be ad∣mitted;
liberty, when opposed to necessity, not to
constraint, is the same thing with chance; which is
universally allowed to have no existence.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no method of reasoning more common,
and yet none more blameable, than in philosophical
debates, to endeavour the refutation of any hypothesis,
by a pretext of its dangerous consequences to religion
and morality. When any opinion leads into absurdi∣ties,
'tis certainly false; but 'tis not certain that an opi∣nion
is false, because 'tis of dangerous consequence.
Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be forborne;
as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to
make the person of an antagonist odious. This I ob∣serve
<PB N="148" REF="147"/>
in general, without pretending to draw any ad∣vantage
from it. I submit frankly to an examination
of this kind, and shall venture to affirm, that the
doctrines, both of necessity and of liberty, as above
explained, are not only consistent with morality and
religion, but are absolutely essential to the support of
them.</P>
<P>NECESSITY may be defined two ways, conformable
to the two definitions of <HI>cause,</HI> of which it makes an
essential part. It consists either in the constant con∣junction
of like objects, or in the inference of the
understanding from one object to another. Now ne∣cessity,
in both these senses, (which, indeed, are, at
bottom, the same) has universally, tho' tacitly, in
the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been
allowed to belong to the will of man; and no man
has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw infe∣rences
concerning human actions, and that those in∣ferences
are founded in the experienced union of like
actions, with like motives, inclinations, and circum∣stances.
The only particular, in which any one can
differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refuse to give
the name of necessity to this property of human ac∣tions:
But as long as the meaning is understood, I
hope the word can do no harm: Or that he will
maintain it possible to discover something farther in
the operations of matter. But this, it must be ac∣knowleged,
<PB N="149" REF="148"/>
can be of no consequence to morality or
religion, whatever it may be to natural philosophy or
metaphysics. We may here be mistaken in asserting,
that there is no idea of any other necessity or connexion
in the actions of body: But surely we ascribe nothing
to the actions of the mind, but what every one does,
and must readily allow of. We change no circum∣stance
in the received orthodox system with regard to
the will, but only in that with regard to material ob∣jects
and causes. Nothing therefore can be more
innocent, at least, than this doctrine.</P>
<P>ALL laws being founded on rewards and punish∣ments,
'tis supposed as a fundamental principle, that
these motives have a regular and uniform influence on
the mind, and both produce the good and prevent
the evil actions. We may give to this influence, what
name we please; but as 'tis usually conjoined with
the action, it must be esteemed a <HI>cause,</HI> and be looked
upon as an instance of that necessity, which we would
here establish.</P>
<P>THE only proper object of hatred or vengeance,
is a person or creature, endowed with thought and
consciousness; and when any criminal or injurious
actions excite that passion, 'tis only by their relation
to the person, or connexion with him. Actions are,
by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and
where they proceed not from some <HI>cause</HI> in the cha∣racters
and disposition of the person who performed
<PB N="150" REF="149"/>
them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good,
nor infamy, if evil. The actions themselves may be
blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of
morality and religion: But the person is not answer∣able
for them; and as they proceeded from nothing
in him, that is durable and constant, and leave no∣thing
of that nature behind them, 'tis impossible he
can, upon their account, become the object of punish∣ment
or vengeance. According to the principle,
therefore, which denies necessity, and consequently
causes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having
committed the most horrid crime, as at the first mo∣ment
of his birth, nor is his charracter any way con∣cerned
in his actions; since they are not derived from
it, and the wickedness of the one can never be used
as a proof of the depravity of the other.</P>
<P>MEN are not blamed for such actions, as they per∣form
ignorantly and casually, whatever may be the
consequences. Why? but because the principles of
these actions are only momentary, and terminate in
them alone. Men are less blamed for such actions as
they perform hastily and unpremeditately, than for
such as proceed from deliberation. For what reason?
but because a hasty temper, tho' a constant cause or
principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and
infects not the whole character. Again, repentance
wipes off every crime, if attended with a reformation
of life and manners. How is this to be accounted
<PB N="151" REF="150"/>
for? but by asserting, that actions render a person
criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal prin∣ciples
in the mind; and when, by any alteration of
these principles, they cease to be just proofs, they like∣wise
cease to be criminal. But except upon the doc∣trine
of necessity, they never were just proofs, and
consequently never were criminal.</P>
<P>IT will be equally easy to prove, and from the same
arguments, that <HI>liberty,</HI> according to that definition
above mentioned, in which all men agree, is also es∣sential
to morality, and that no human actions, where
it is wanting, are susceptible of any moral qualities,
or can be the objects either of approbation or dislike.
For as actions are objects of our moral sentiments, so
far only as they are indications of the internal cha∣racter,
passions, and affections; 'tis impossible that
they can give rise either to praise or blame, where
they proceed not from these principles, but are de∣rived
altogether from external violence.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not to have obviated or removed all
objections to this theory, with regard to necessity and
liberty. I can foresee other objections, derived from
topics, which have not here been treated of. It may
be said, for instance, that if voluntary actions be sub∣jected
to the same laws of necessity with the opera∣tions
of matter, there is a continued chain of necessary
causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined, reaching
<PB N="152" REF="151"/>
from the original cause of all, to every single volition
of every human creature. No contingency any where
in the universe; no indifference; no liberty. While
we act, we are, at the same time, acted upon. The
ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of
the world, who first bestowed motion on this immense
machine, and placed all beings in that particular po∣sition,
whence every subsequent event, by an inevi∣table
necessity, must result. Human actions, there∣fore,
either can have no moral turpitude at all, as
proceeding from so good a cause; or if they have any
turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same
guilt, while he is acknowleged to be their ultimate
cause and author. For as a man, who fired a mine,
is answerable for all the consequences, whether the
train he employed be long or short: so wherever a
continued chain of necessary causes are fixed, that Be∣ing,
either finite or infinite, who produces the first,
is likewise the author of all the rest, and must both
bear the blame and acquire the praise, which belong
to them. Our clearest and most unalterable ideas of
morality establish this rule, upon unquestionable rea∣sons,
when we examine the consequences of any hu∣man
action; and these reasons must still have greater
force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of
a Being, infinitely wise and powerful. Ignorance or
impotence may be pleaded for so limited a creature as
man; but those imperfections have no place in our
Creator. He foresaw, he ordained, he intended all
<PB N="153" REF="152"/>
those actions of men, which we so rashly pronounce
criminal. And we must conclude, therefore, either
that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not
man, is accountable for them. But as either of these
positions is absurd and impious, it follows, that the
doctrine from which they are deduced, cannot pos∣sibly
be true, as being liable to all the same objections.
An absurd consequence, if necessary, proves the ori∣ginal
doctrine to be absurd; in the same manner that
criminal actions render criminal the original cause, if
the connexion between them be necessary and ine∣vitable.</P>
<P>THIS
objection consists of two parts, which we shall
examine separately; <HI>First,</HI> that if human actions can
be traced up, by a necessary chain, to the Deity, they
can never be criminal; on account of the infinite per∣fection
of that Being, from whom they are derived,
and who can intend nothing but what is altogether
good and laudable. Or <HI>Secondly,</HI> if they be criminal,
we must retract the attribute of perfection, which we
ascribe to the Deity, and must acknowlege him to be
the ultimate author of guilt and moral trupitude in
all his creatures.</P>
<P>THE answer to the first objection seems obvious and
convincing. There are many philosophers, who, af∣ter
an exact scrutiny of all the phaenomena of nature,
conclude, that the WHOLE, considered as one system,
<PB N="154" REF="153"/>
is, in every period of its existence, ordered with per∣fect
benevolence; and that the utmost possible hap∣piness
will, in the end, result to every created being,
without any mixture of positive or absolute ill and
misery. Every physical ill, say they, makes an es∣sential
part of this benevolent system, and could not
possibly be removed, even by the Deity himself, con∣sidered
as a wise agent, without giving entrance to
greater ill, or excluding greater good, which will re∣sult
from it. From this theory, some philosophers,
and the antient <HI>Stoics</HI> among the rest, derived a topic
of consolation, under all afflictions, while they taught
their pupils, that those ills, under which they laboured,
were, in reality, goods to the universe; and that to
an enlarged view, which could comprehend the whole
system of nature, every event became an object of joy
and exultation. But tho' this topic be specious and
sublime, it was soon found in practice weak and in∣effectual.
You would surely more irritate, than ap∣pease
a man, lying under the racking pains of the
gout, by preaching up to him the rectitude of those
general laws, which produced the malignant humours
in his body, and led them, thro' the proper canals,
to the nerves and sinews, where they now excite such
acute torments. These enlarged views may, for a
moment, please the imagination of a speculative man,
who is placed in ease and security; but neither can
they dwell with constancy on his mind, even tho' un∣disturbed
by the emotions of pain or passion; much
<PB N="155" REF="154"/>
less can they maintain their ground, when attacked
by such powerful antagonists. The affections take a
narrower and more natural survey of their objects, and
by an oeconomy, more suitable to the infirmity of hu∣man
minds, regard alone the beings around us, and are
actuated by such events as appear good or ill to the
private system. The case is the same with <HI>moral</HI> as
with <HI>physical</HI> ill. It cannot reasonably be supposed,
that those remote considerations, which are found of
so little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more
powerful influence with regard to the other. The
mind of man is so formed by nature, that, upon the
appearance of certain characters, dispositions, and
actions, it immediately feels the sentiment of appro∣bation
or blame; nor are there any emotions more
essential to its frame and constitution.</P>
<P>THE characters, which engage its approbation, are
chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of
human society; as the characters, which excite blame,
are chiefly such as tend to public detriment and dis∣turbance:
Whence we may reasonably presume, that
the moral sentiments arise, either mediately or im∣mediately,
from a reflection on these opposite interests.
What tho' philosophical meditations establish a diffe∣rent
opinion or conjecture; that every thing is right
with regard to the WHOLE, and that the qualities,
which disturb society, are, in the main, as beneficial,
and are as suitable to the primary intention of na∣ture,
<PB N="156" REF="155"/>
as those which more directly promote its hap∣piness
and welfare? Are such remote and uncertain
speculations able to counter-balance the sentiments,
which arise from the natural and immediate view of
the objects? A man, who is robbed of a conside∣rable
sum; does he find his vexation for the loss any
way diminished by these sublime reflections? Why
then should his moral resentment against the crime be
supposed incompatible with them? Or why should
not the acknowlegement of a real distinction between
vice and virtue be reconcileable to all speculative
systems of philosophy, as well as that of a real dis∣tinction
between personal beauty and deformity?
Both these distinctions are founded in the natural
sentiments of the human mind: And these sentiments
are not to be controled nor altered by any philoso∣phical
theory or speculation whatsoever.</P>
<P>THE <HI>second</HI> objection admits not of so easy and sa∣tisfactory
an answer; nor is it possible to explain dis∣tinctly,
how the Deity can be the mediate cause of
all the actions of men, without being the author of
sin and moral turpitude. These are mysteries, which
mere natural and unassisted reason is very unfit to
handle; and whatever system it embraces, it must find
itself involved in inextricable difficulties, and even
contradictions, at every step which it takes with re∣gard
to such subjects. To reconcile the indifference
and contingency of human actions with prescience;
<PB N="157" REF="156"/>
or to defend absolute decrees, and yet free the Deity
from being the author of sin, has been found hitherto
to exceed all the skill of philosophy. Happy, if she
be thence sensible of her temerity, when she pries
into these sublime mysteries; and leaving a scene so
full of obscurities and perplexities, return, with suit∣able
modesty, to her true and proper province, the ex∣amination
of common life; where she will find diffi∣culties
enow to employ her enquiries, without launch∣ing
into so boundless an ocean of doubt, uncertainty,
and contradiction!</P>

<P>ALL our reasonings concerning matter of fact
are founded on a species of ANALOGY, which
leads us to expect from any cause the same events,
which we have observed to result from similar causes.
Where the causes are entirely similar, the analogy is
perfect, and the inference, drawn from it, is regarded
as certain and conclusive: Nor does any man ever
entertain a doubt, where he sees a piece of iron, that
it will have weight and cohesion of parts; as in all
other instances, which have ever fallen under his ob∣servation.
But where the objects have not so exact a
similarity, the analogy is less perfect, and the infe∣rence
is less conclusive; tho' still it has some force,
in proportion to the degrees of similarity and resem∣blance.

one animal, are by this species of reasoning ex∣tended
to all animals; and 'tis certain, that when the
circulation of the blood, for instance, is proved clearly
to have place in one creature, as a frog or fish, it
<PB N="160" REF="158"/>
forms a strong presumption, that the same principle
has place in all. These analogical observations may
be carried farther, even to this science, of which we
are now treating; and any theory, by which we ex∣plain
the operations of the understanding, or the ori∣gin
and connexion of the passions in man, will acquire
additional authority, if we find, that the same theory
is requisite to explain the same phaenomena in all
other animals. We shall make trial of this, with re∣gard
to the hypothesis, by which, in the foregoing
discourse, we have endeavored to account for all ex∣perimental
reasonings; and 'tis hoped, that this new
point of view will serve to confirm all our former ob∣servations.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI>
IT seems evident, that animals, as well as
men, learn many things from experience, and infer,
that the same events will always follow from the same
causes. By this principle, they become acquainted
with the more obvious properties of external objects,
and gradually, from their birth, treasure up a know∣lege
of the nature of fire, water, earth, stones, heights,
dephts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the effects, which result from their
operation. The ignorance and inexperience of the
young are here plainly distinguishable from the cun∣ning
and sagacity of the old, who have learned, by
long observation, to avoid what hurt them, and to
pursue what gave ease or pleasure. A horse, that
has been accustomed to the field, becomes acquainted
<PB N="161" REF="159"/>
with the proper height, which he can leap, and will
never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An
old greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of
the chace to the younger, and will place himself so
as to meet the hare in her doubles; nor are the con∣jectures,
which he forms on this occasion, founded in
any thing but his observation and experience.</P>
<P>THIS is still more evident from the effects of dis∣cipline
and education on animals, who, by the porper
application of rewards and punishments, may be taught
any course of action, the most contrary to their na∣tural
instincts and propensities. Is it not experience,
which renders a dog apprehensive of pain, when you
menace him, or lift up the whip to beat him? Is it
not even experience, which makes him answer to his
name, and infer, from such an arbitrary sound, that
you mean him rather than any of his fellows, and
intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a cer∣tain
manner, and with a certain tone and accent?</P>
<P>IN all these cases, we may observe, that the animal
infers some fact beyond what immediately strikes his
senses; and that this inference is altogether founded
on past experience, while the creature expects from
the present object the same events, which it has al∣ways
found in its observation to result from similar
objects.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="160"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> 'TIS impossible, that this inference of the
animal can be founded on any process of argument
or reasoning, by which he concludes, that like events
must follow like objects, and that the course of na∣ture
will always be regular in its operations. For if
there be in reality any arguments of this nature, they
surely lie too abstruse for the observation of such im∣perfect
understandings; since it may well employ the
utmost care and attention of a philosophic genius to
discover and observe them. Animals, therefore, are not
guided in these inferences by reasoning: Neither are
children: Neither are the generality of mankind, in
their ordinary actions and conclusions: Neither are phi∣losophers
themselves, who, in all the active parts of life,
are, in the main, the same with the vulgar, and are go∣verned
by the same maxims. Nature must have pro∣vided
some other principle, of more ready, and more
general use and application; nor can an operation of
such immense consequence in life, as that of inferring
effects from causes, be trusted to the uncertain pro∣cess
of reasoning and argumentation. Were this doubt∣ful
with regard to men, it seems to admit of no ques∣tion
with regard to the brute-creation; and the con∣clusion
being once firmly established in the one, we
have a strong presumption, from all the rules of ana∣logy,
that it ought to be universally admitted, with∣out
any exception or reserve. 'Tis custom alone,
which engages animals, from every object, that strikes
their senses, to infer its usual attendant, and carries
<PB N="163" REF="161"/>
their imagination, from the appearance of the one,
to conceive the other, in that strong and lively man∣ner,
which we denominate <HI>belief.</HI> No other explica∣tion
can be given of this operation, in all the higher,
as well as lower classes of sensitive beings, which
fall under our notice and observation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Since all reasonings concerning facts or causes is derived merely from custom, it may be asked how it happens, that men so much surpass animals in reasoning, and one man so much surpasses another? Has not the same custom the same influence on all?</P>
<P>We shall here endeavour briefly to explain the great difference in human understandings: After which, the reason of the diffe∣rence between men and animals will easily be comprehended.</P>
<P>1. When we have lived any time, and have been accustomed to the uniformity of nature, we acquire a general habit, by which we always transfer the known to the unknown, and con∣ceive the latter to resemble the former. By means of this gene∣ral habitual principle, we regard even one experiment as the foun∣dation of reasoning, and expect a similar event with some degree of certainty, where the experiment has been made accurately, and free from all foreign circumstances. 'Tis therefore considered as a matter of great importance to observe the consequences of things; and as one man may very much surpass another in at∣tention and memory and observation, this will make a very great difference in their reasoning.</P>
<P>2. Where there is a complication of causes to produce any effect, one mind may be much larger than another, and better able to comprehend the whole system of objects, and to infer justly their consequences.</P>
<P>3. One man is able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater length than another.</P>
<P>4. Few men can think long without running into a confusion of ideas, and mistaking one for another; and there are various degrees of this infirmity.</P>
<P>5. The circumstance, on which the effect depends, is fre∣quently involved in other circumstances, which are foreign and extrinsic. The separation of it often requires great attention, accuracy, and subtilty.</P>
<P>6. The forming general maxims from particular observation is a very nice operation; and nothing is more usual, from haste or a narrowness of mind, which sees not on all sides, than to com∣mit mistakes in this particular.</P>
<P>7. When we reason from analogies, the man, who has the greater experience or the greater promptitude of suggesting ana∣logies, will be the better reasoner.</P>
<P>8. Byasses from prejudice, education, passion, party, &amp;c. hang more upon one mind than another.</P>
<P>9. After we have acquired a confidence in human testimony, books and conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one man's experience and thought than those of another.</P>
<P>'Twould be easy to discover many other circumstances that make a difference in the understandings of men.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="162"/>
BUT tho' animals learn many parts of their know∣lege
from observation, there are also many parts of
<PB N="165" REF="163"/>
it, which they derive from the original hand of na∣ture,
which much exceed the share of capacity they
possess on ordinary occasions; and in which they im∣prove,
little or nothing, by the longest practice and
experience. These we denominate INSTINCTS, and
are so apt to admire, as something very extraordinary,
and inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human un∣derstanding.
But our wonder will, perhaps, cease or
diminish; when we consider, that the experimental
reasoning itself, which we possess in common with
beasts, and on which the whole conduct of life de∣pends,
is nothing but a species of instinct or mecha∣nical
power, that acts in us unknown to ourselves;
and in its chief operations, is not directed by any
such relations or comparisons of ideas, as are the pro∣per
objects of our intellectual faculties. Tho' the in∣stinct
be different, yet still it is an instinct, which
teaches a man to avoid the fire; as much as that,
which teaches a bird, with such exactness, the art
of incubation, and the whole oeconomy and order
of its nursery.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is in Dr. TILLOTSON's writings an
argument against the <HI>real presence,</HI> which is as
concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument can
possibly be supposed against a doctrine, that is so little
worthy of a serious refutation. 'Tis acknowleged on
all hands, says that learned prelate, that the autho∣rity,
either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded
merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye∣witnesses
to those miracles of our Saviour, by which
he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then,
for the truth of the <HI>Christian</HI> religion is less than the
evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even
in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater;
and 'tis evident it must diminish in passing from them
to their disciples; nor can any one be so certain of
<PB N="168" REF="165"/>
the truth of their testimony, as of the immediate ob∣ject
of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never
destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine
of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scrip∣ture,
it were directly contrary to the rules of just rea∣soning
to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense,
tho' both the scripture and tradition, on which it is
supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with
them as sense; when they are considered merely as
external evidences, and are not brought home to every
one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy
Spirit.</P>
<P>NOTHING is so convenient as a decisive argument
of this kind, which must at least <HI>silence</HI> the most ar∣rogant
bigotry and superstition, and free us from their
impertinent sollicitations. I flatter myself, that I have
discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if
just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlast∣ing
check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and
consequently, will be useful as long as the world en∣dures.
For so long, I presume, will the accounts of
miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred
and profane.</P>
<P>THO' experience be our only guide in reasoning
concerning matters of fact; it must be acknow∣leged,
that this guide is not altogether infallible,
but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors and
<PB N="169" REF="166"/>
mistakes. One, who, in our climate, should expect
better weather in any week of JUNE than in one of
DECEMBER, would reason justly and conformable to
experience; but 'tis certain, that he may happen,
in the event, to find himself mistaken. However,
we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have
no cause to complain of experience; because it com∣monly
informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by
that contrariety of events, which we may learn from
a diligent observation. All effects follow not with
like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events
are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been
constantly conjoined together: Others are found to
have been more variable, and sometimes to disap∣point
our expectations; so that in our reasonings con∣cerning
matter of fact, there are all imaginable de∣grees
of assurance, from the highest certainty to the
lowest species of moral evidence.</P>
<P>A WISE man, therefore, proportions his belief to
the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on
an infallible experience, he expects the event with
the last degree of assurance, and regards his past ex∣perience
as a full <HI>proof</HI> of the future existence of that
event. In other cases, he proceeds with more cau∣tion:
He weighs the opposite experiments: He con∣siders
which side is supported by the greatest number
of experiments: To that side he inclines, with doubt
and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgment▪
<PB N="170" REF="167"/>
the evidence exceeds not what we properly call <HI>pro∣bability.</HI>
All probability, then, supposes an opposi∣tion
of experiments and observations; where the one
side is found to over-balance the other, and to pro∣duce
a degree of evidence, proportioned to the su∣periority.
An hundred instances or experiments on
one side, and fifty on another, afford a very doubtful
expectation of any event; tho' a hundred uniform
experiments, with only one that is contradictory, rea∣sonably
beget a pretty strong degree of assurance.
In all cases, we must balance the opposite experi∣ments,
where they are opposite, and deduct the
smaller number from the greater, in order to know
the exact force of the superior evidence.</P>
<P>TO apply these principles to a particular instance;
we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning
more common, more useful, and even necessary to
human life, than that derived from the testimony of
men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators.
This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny
to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I
shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient
to observe, that our assurance in any argument of
this kind is derived from no other principle than our
observation of the veracity of human testimony, and
of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of wit∣nesses.
It being a general maxim, that no objects
have any discoverable connexion together, and that
<PB N="171" REF="168"/>
all the inferences, which we can draw from one to
another, are founded merely on our experience of
their constant and regular conjunction; 'tis evident,
that we ought not to make an exception to this
maxim in favour of human testimony, whose con∣nexion
with any events seems, in itself, as little ne∣cessary
as any other. Were not the memory tena∣cious
to a certain degree; had not men commonly an
inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were
they not sensible to shame, when detected in a false∣hood:
Were not these, I say, discovered by <HI>experi∣ence</HI>
to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we
should never repose the least confidence in human
testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falshood
and villainy, has no manner of authority with us.</P>
<P>AND as the evidence, derived from witnesses and
human testimony, is founded on past experience,
so it varies with the experience, and is regarded
either as a <HI>proof</HI> or a <HI>probability,</HI> according as the
conjunction between any particular kind of report
and any kind of objects, has been found to be con∣stant
or variable. There are a number of circum∣stances
to be taken into consideration in all judg∣ments
of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by
which we determine all disputes, that may arise con∣cerning
them, is always derived from experience and
observation. Where this experience is not entirely
uniform on any side, 'tis attended with an unavoid∣able
contrariety in our judgments, and with the same
<PB N="172" REF="169"/>
opposition and mutual destruction of arguments as in
every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate
concerning the reports of others. We balance the
opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or un∣certainty;
and when we discover a superiority on any
side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of
assurance, in proportion to the forec of its anta∣gonist.</P>
<P>THIS
contrariety of evidence, in the present case,
may be derived from several different causes; from
the opposition of contrary testimony; from the cha∣racter
or number of the witnesses; from the manner
of their delivering their testimony; or from the union
of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion
concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses
contradict each other; when they are but few, or of
a suspicious character; when they have an interest in
what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony
with doubt and hesitation, or on the contrary, with
too violent asseverations. There are many other par∣ticulars
of the same kind, which may diminish or de∣stroy
the force of any argument, derived from human
testimony.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, for instance, that the fact, which tes∣timony
endeavours to establish, partakes of the ex∣traordinary
and the marvellous; in that case, the evi∣dence,
resulting from the testimony, admits a dimi∣nution,
<PB N="173" REF="170"/>
greater or less, in proportion as the fact is
more or less unusual. The reason, why we place any
credit in witnesses and historians is not from any <HI>con∣nex
on,</HI> which we perceive <HI>à priori</HI> between testimony
and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a
conformity between them. But when the fact attested
is such a one as has seldom fallen under our obser∣vation,
here is a contest of two opposite experiences;
of which the one destroys the other as far as its force
goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind
by the force, which remains. The very same prin∣ciple
of experience, which gives us a certain degree
of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us
also, in this case, another degree of assurance against
the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from
which contradiction there necessarily arise a counter∣poize,
and mutual destruction of belief and autho∣rity.</P>
<P><HI>I
should not believe such a story were it told me by</HI>
CATO; was a proverbial saying in ROME, even du∣ring
the life-time of that philosophical patriot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH, in vita CATONIS.</NOTE>. The
incredibility of a fact, it was allowed, might invalidate
so great an authority.</P>
<P>THE INDIAN prince, who refused to believe the
first relations concerning the effects of frost, reasoned
<PB N="174" REF="171"/>
justly; and it naturally required very strong testimony
to engage his assent to facts, which arose from a state
of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and bore
so little analogy to those events, of which he had had
constant and uniform experience. Tho' they were
not contrary to his experience, they were not con∣formable
to it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No INDIAN, 'tis evident, could have experience that water did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a situ∣ation quite unknown to him; and 'tis impossible for him to tell <HI>à priori</HI> what will result from it. 'Tis making a new experi∣ment, the consequence of which is always uncertain. One may sometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow; but still this is but conjecture. And it must be confest, that, in the pre∣sent case of freezing, the event follows contrary to the rules of analogy, and is such as a rational INDIAN would not look for. The operations of cold upon water are not gradual, according to the degrees of cold; but whenever it comes to the freezing point, the water passes in a moment, from the utmost liquidity to per∣fect hardness. Such an event, therefore, may be denominated <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and requires a pretty strong testimony, to render it credible to people in a warm climate: But still it is not <HI>mira∣calous,</HI> nor contrary to uniform experience of the course of na∣ture in cases where all the circumstances are the same. The in∣habitants of SUMATRA have always seen water liquid in their own climate, and the freezing of their rivers ought to be deemed a prodigy: But they never saw water in MUSCOVY during the winter; and therefore they cannot reasonably be positive what would there be the consequence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="172"/>
BUT in order to increase the probability against the
testimony of witnesses, let us suppose that the fact,
which they affirm, instead of being only marvellous,
is really miraculous; and suppose also, that the testi∣mony,
considered apart, and in itself, amounts to an
entire proof; in that case there is proof against proof,
of which the strongest must prevail, but still with a
diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its
antagonist.</P>
<P>A MIRACLE is a violation of the laws of nature:
and as a firm and unalterable experience has esta∣blished
these laws, the proof against a miracle, from
the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argu∣ment
from experience can possibly be imagined. Why
is it more than probable, that all men must die; that
lead cannot, of itself, remain suspended in the air;
that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by wa∣ter;
unless it be, that these events are found agree∣able
to the laws of nature, and there is required a
violation of these laws, or in other words, a miracle
to prevent them? Nothing is esteemed a miracle if
it ever happen in the common course of nature. 'Tis
no miracle that a man in seeming good health should
die on a sudden; because such a kind of death, tho'
more unusual than any other, has yet been frequently
observed to happen. But 'tis a miracle, that a dead
man should come to life; because that has never been
<PB N="176" REF="173"/>
observed, in any age or country. There must, there∣fore,
be an uniform experience against every miracu∣lous
event, otherwise the event would not merit that
appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts
to a proof there is here a direct and full <HI>proof,</HI> from
the nature of the fact, against the existence of any
miracle; nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the
miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof,
which is superior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes an event may not, <HI>in itself, seem</HI> to be contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by rea∣son of some circumstances, be denominated a miracle; because, in <HI>fact,</HI> it is contrary to these laws. Thus if a person, claim∣ing a divine authority, should command a sick person to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in short, should order many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command; these might justly be esteemed miracles, because they are really, in this case, con∣trary to the laws of nature. For if any suspicion remain, that the event and command concurred by accident, there is no mi∣racle and no transgression of the laws of nature. If this sus∣picion be removed, there is evidently a miracle, and a transgres∣sion of these laws; because nothing can be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a man should have such an influence. A miracle may be accurately defined, <HI>a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the interposition of some invisible agent.</HI> A miracle may ei∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discoverable by men or not. This alters not its nature and essence. The raising of a house or ship into the air is a visible miracle. The raising of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite for that purpose, is as real a miracle, tho' not so sensible with regard to us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="174"/>
THE plain consequence is (and 'tis a general max∣im
worthy of our attention) <Q REND="inline">"That no testimony is
sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testi∣mony
be of such a kind, that its falshood would
be more miraculous, than the fact, which it en∣deavours
to establish: And even in that case, there
is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the su∣perior
only gives us an assurance suitable to that
degree of force, which remains, after deducting
the inferior."</Q> When any one tells me, that he
saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately con∣sider
with myself, whether it be more probable,
that this person should either deceive or be deceived,
or that the fact which he relates, should really have
happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other,
and according to the superiority, which I discover, I
pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater
miracle. If the falshood of his testimony would be
more miraculous, than the event which he relates;
then, and not till then, can he pretend to command
my belief or opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="175"/>
IN the foregoing reasoning we have supposed, that
the testimony, upon which a miracle is founded, may
possibly amount to an intire proof, and that the fals∣hood
of that testimony would be a kind of prodigy.
But 'tis easy to shew, that we have been a great deal
too liberal in our concessions, and that there never
was a miraculous event established on so full an evi∣dence.</P>
<P>FOR
<HI>first,</HI> there is not to be found, in all history,
any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of
such unquestioned good-sense, education, and learn∣ing,
as to secure us against all delusion in themselves;
of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond
all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such
credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to
have a great deal to lose in case of being detected in
any falshood; and at the same time attesting facts,
performed in such a public manner, and in so celebra∣ted
a part of the world, as to render the detection un∣avoidable:
All which circumstances are requisite to
give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. We may observe in human nature a
principle, which, if strictly examined, will be found to
diminish extremely the assurance which we might
have, from human testimony, in any kind of prodigy.
<PB N="179" REF="176"/>
The maxim, by which we commonly conduct our∣selves
in our reasonings, is, that the objects, of which
we have no experience, resemble those, of which we
have: that what we have sound to be most usual is
always most probable; and that where there is an op∣position
of arguments, we ought to give the prefe∣rence
to such of them as are founded on the greatest
number of past observations. But tho' in proceeding
by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unu∣sual
and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in ad∣vancing
farther, the mind observes not always the
same rule; but when any thing is affirmed utterly ab∣surd
and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits
such a fact, upon account of that very circumstance
which ought to destroy all its authority. The passion
of <HI>surprize</HI> and <HI>wonder,</HI> arising from miracles, being
an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible tendency to∣wards
the belief of those events from which it is de∣rived.
And this goes so far, that even those who
cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately, nor can be∣lieve
those miraculous events, of which they are in∣formed,
yet love to partake of the satisfaction at se∣cond
hand or by rebound, and place a pride and de∣light
in exciting the admiration of others.</P>
<P>WITH what greediness are the miraculous accounts
of travellers received, their descriptions of sea and
land monsters, their relations of wonderful adven∣tures,
strange men, and uncouth manners? But if
<PB N="180" REF="177"/>
the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder,
there is an end of common sense; and human testi∣mony,
in these circumstances, loses all pretensions to
authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and
imagine he sees what has no reality: He may know
his narration to be false, and yet persevere in it, with
the best intentions in the world, for the sake of pro∣moting
so holy a cause: Or even where this delusion
has no place, vanity, excited by so strong a tempta∣tion,
operates on him more powerfully than on the
rest of mankind in any other circumstances; and self-interest
with equal force. His auditors may not have,
and commonly have not sufficient judgment to canvass
his evidence: What judgment they have, they re∣nounce
by principle, in these sublime and mysterious
subjects: Or if they were ever so willing to employ
it, passion and a heated imagination disturb the regu∣larity
of its operations. Their credulity increases his
impudence: And his impudence over-powers their
credulity.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, when in its highest pitch, leaves
little room for reason or reflection; but addressing it∣self
intirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates
the willing hearers, and subdues their understanding.
Happily, this pitch it seldom attains. But what a
CICERO or a DEMOSTHENES could scarcely operate
over a ROMAN or ATHENIAN audience, every <HI>Capu∣chin,</HI>
every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform
<PB N="181" REF="178"/>
over the generality of mankind, and in a higher de∣gree,
by touching such gross and vulgar passions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The many instances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and supernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detect∣ed by contrary evidence, or which detect themselves by their ab∣surdity, mark sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind. This is our natu∣ral way of thinking, even with regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance: There is no kind of re∣port, which rises so easily, and spreads so quickly, especially in country places and provincial towns, as those concerning mar∣riages; insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood imme∣diately join them together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of propagating it, and of being the first re∣porters of it, spreads the intelligence. And this is so well known, that no man of sense gives attention to these reports, till he finds them confirmed by some greater evidence. Do not the same passions, and others still stronger, incline the generality of mankind to the believing and reporting, with the greatest ve∣hemence and assurance, all religious miracles?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. It forms a very strong presumption
against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that
they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant
and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has
ever given admission to any of them, that people will
be found to have received them from ignorant and
barbarous ancestors, who transmitted them with that
inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend
<PB N="182" REF="179"/>
received opinions. When we peruse the first histories
of all nations, we are apt to imagine ourselves trans∣ported
into some new world, where the whole frame
of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its
operations in a different manner, from what it does
at present. Battles, revolutions, pestilences, famines,
and death, are never the effects of those natural cau∣ses,
which we experience. Prodigies, omens, ora∣cles,
judgments, quite obscure the few natural events,
that are intermingled with them. But as the former
grow thinner every page, in proportion as we advance
nearer the enlightened ages of science and knowlege,
we soon learn, that there is nothing mysterious or su∣pernatural
in the case, but that all proceeds from the
usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous,
and that tho' this inclination may at intervals receive
a check from sense and learning, it can never tho∣roughly
be extirpated from human nature.</P>
<P>'<HI>Tis strange,</HI> a judicious reader is apt to say, upon
the perusal of these wonderful historians, <HI>that such
prodigious events never happen in our days.</HI> But 'tis no∣thing
strange, I hope, that men should lie in all
ages. You must surely have seen instances enow of
that frailty. You have yourself heard many such
marvellous relations started, which being treated with
scorn by all the wise and judicious, have at last been
abandoned even by the vulgar. Be assured, that those
renowned lies, which have spread and flourished to such
<PB N="183" REF="180"/>
a monstrous height, arose from like beginnings; but
being sown in a more proper soil, shot up at last into
prodigies almost equal to those which they relate.</P>
<P>'TWAS a wise policy in that cunning impostor,
ALEXANDER, who, tho' now forgotten, was once so
famous, to lay the first scene of his impostures in PA∣PHLAGONIA,
where, as LUCIAN tells us, the people
were extremely ignorant and stupid, and ready to
swallow even the grossest delusion. People at a dis∣tance,
who are weak enough to think the matter at
all worth inquiry, have no opportunity of receiving
better information. The stories come magnified to
them by a hundred circumstances. Fools are indus∣trious
to propagate the delusion; while the wise and
learned are contented, in general, to deride its ab∣surdity,
without informing themselves of the particu∣lar
facts by which it may be distinctly refuted. And
thus the impostor above-mentioned was enabled to
proceed, from his ignorant PAPHLAGONIANS, to the
inlisting of votaries, even among the GRECIAN phi∣losophers,
and men of the most eminent rank and
distinction in ROME: Nay, could engage the atten∣tion
of that sage emperor MARCUS AURELIUS; so
far as to make him trust the success of a military ex∣pedition
to his delusive prophecies.</P>
<P>THE advantages are so great of starting an impos∣ture
among an ignorant people, that even tho' the de∣lusion
<PB N="184" REF="181"/>
should be too gross to impose on the generality
of them <HI>(which, tho' seldom, is sometimes the case)</HI> it
has a much better chance of succeeding in remote
countries, than if the first scene had been laid in a
city renowned for arts and knowlege. The most ig∣norant
and barbarous of these barbarians carry the re∣port
abroad. None of their countrymen have large
enough correspondence of sufficient credit and autho∣rity
to contradict and beat down the delusion. Mens
inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to
display itself. And thus a story, which is univer∣sally
exploded in the place where it was first started,
shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance.
But had ALEXANDER fixed his residence at ATHENS,
the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning
had immediately spread, thro' the whole ROMAN
empire, their sense of the matter, which, being sup∣ported
by so great authority, and displayed by all the
force of reason and eloquence, had intirely opened
the eyes of mankind. 'Tis true; LUCIAN passing by
chance thro' PAPHLAGONIA had an opportunity of
performing this good office. But, tho' much to be
wished, it does not always happen, that every ALE∣XANDER
meets with a LUCIAN, ready to expose and
detect his impostures<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It may here, perhaps, be objected, that I proceed rashly, and form my notions of ALEXANDER merely from the account given of him by LUCIAN, a professed enemy. It were, indeed, to be wished, that some of the accounts published by his follow∣ers and accomplices had remained. The opposition and contrast between the character and conduct of the same man, as drawn by a friend or an enemy, is as strong, even in common life, much more in these religious matters, as that betwixt any two men in the world, betwixt ALEXANDER and St. PAUL, for instance. See a letter to GILBERT WEST, Esq. on the conversion and apostleship of St. PAUL.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="182"/>
I MAY add as a <HI>fourth</HI> reason, which diminishes
the authority of prodigies, that there is no testimony
for any, even those which have not been expressly de∣tected,
that is not opposed by an infinite number of
witnesses; so that not only the miracle destroys the
credit of the testimony, but even the testimony de∣stroys
itself. To make this the better understood, let
us consider that, in matters of religion, whatever is
different is contrary, and that 'tis impossible the reli∣gions
of antient ROME, of TURKEY, of SIAM, and
of CHINA should, all of them, be established on any
solid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretend∣ed
to have been wrought in any of these religions
(and all of them abound in miracles) as its direct
scope is to establish the particular system to which it is
attributed; so has it the same force, tho' more indi∣rectly,
to overthrow every other system. In destroy∣ing
a rival system, it likewise destroys the credit of
those miracles, on which that system was established;
so that all the prodigies of different religions are to
be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of
<PB N="186" REF="183"/>
these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as opposite
to each other. According to this method of reason∣ing,
when we believe any miracle of MAHOMET or
any of his successors, we have for our warrant the tes∣timony
of a few barbarous ARABIANS: And on the
other hand, we are to regard the authority of TITUS
LIVIUS, PLUTARCH, TACITUS, and, in short, of all
the authors and witnesses, GRECIAN, CHINESE, and
ROMAN CATHOLIC, who have related any miracles
in their particular religion; I say, we are to regard
their testimony in the same light as if they had men∣tioned
that MAHOMETAN miracle, and had in express
terms contradicted it, with the same certainty as they
have for the miracles they relate. This argument
may appear over subtile and refined; but is not in re∣ality
different from the reasoning of a judge, who sup∣poses,
that the credit of two witnesses, maintaining a
crime against any one, is destroyed by the testimony of
two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred
leagues distant, at the same instant when the crime is
said to have been committed.</P>
<P>ONE of the best attested miracles in all prophane
history, is that which TACITUS reports of VESPA∣SIAN,
who cured a blind man in ALEXANDRIA, by
means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere
touch of his foot; in obedience to a vision of the god
SERAPIS, who had enjoined them to have recourse to
the Emperor, for these miraculous and extraordinary
<PB N="187" REF="184"/>
cures. The story may be seen in that fine historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. Lib. 5. Cap. 8. SUETONIUS gives the same ac∣count <HI>in vita</HI> VESP.</NOTE>;
where every circumstance seems to add weight to the
testimony, and might be displayed at large with all
the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were
now concerned to enforce the evidence of that explo∣ded
and idolatrous superstition. The gravity, solidity,
age, and probity of so great an emperor, who, thro'
the whole course of his life, conversed in a familiar
way with his friends and courtiers, and never affected
those extraordinary airs of divinity assumed by ALE∣XANDER
and DEMETRIUS. The historian, a cotem∣porary
writer, noted for candour and veracity, and
withal, the greatest and most penetrating genius, per∣haps
of all antiquity; and so free from any tendency
to superstition and credulity, that he even lies under
the contrary imputation, of atheism and prophane∣ness:
The persons, from whose testimony he related
the miracle, of established character for judgment and
veracity, as we may well presume; eye-witnesses of
the fact, and confirming their verdict, after the FLA∣VIAN
family were despoiled of the empire, and could
no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie.
<HI>Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, post∣quam
nullum mendacio pretium.</HI> To which if we add
the public nature of the facts, as related, it will ap∣pear,
<PB N="188" REF="185"/>
that no evidence can well be supposed stronger
for so gross and so palpable a falshood.</P>
<P>THERE is also a very memorable story related by
Cardinal DE RETZ, and which may well deserve our
consideration. When that intriguing politician fled
into SPAIN, to avoid the persecution of his enemies,
he passed thro' SARAGOSSA, the capital of ARRA∣GON,
where he was shewn, in the cathedral, a man,
who had served twenty years as a door-keeper, and
was well known to every body in town, that had ever
paid their devotions at that church. He had been
seen, for so long a time, wanting a leg; but recover∣ed
that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the
stump; and the cardinal assures us that he saw him
with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the
canons of the church; and the whole company in
town were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact;
whom the cardinal found, by their zealous devotion,
to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the re∣later
was also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy,
of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of
great genius, the miracle of so <HI>singular</HI> a nature as
could scarce admit of a counterfeit, and the witnesses
very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, specta∣tors
of the fact to which they gave their testimony.
And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence,
and may double our surprize on this occasion, is, that
the cardinal himself, who relates the story, seems not
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
to give any credit to it, and consequently cannot be
suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He
considered justly, that it was not requisite, in order to
reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to
disprove the testimony, and to trace its falshood,
thro' all the circumstances of knavery and credulity
which produced it. He knew, that as this was com∣monly
altogether impossible at any small distance of
time and place; so was it extremely difficult, even
where one was immediately present, by reason of the
bigotry, ignorance, cunning and roguery of a great
part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a
just reasoner, that such an evidence carried falshood
upon the very face of it, and that a miracle supported
by any human testimony, was more properly a subject
of derision than of argument.</P>
<P>THERE surely never was so great a number of mi∣racles
ascribed to one person, as those, which were
lately said to have been wrought in FRANCE upon the
tomb of Abbé PARIS, the famous JANSENIST, with
whose sanctity the people were so long deluded. The
curing of the sick, giving hearing to the deaf, and
sight to the blind, were every where talked of as the
usual effects of that holy sepulchre. But what is
more extraordinary; many of the miracles were im∣mediately
proved, upon the spot, before judges of
unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses of credit
and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is
this all: A relation of them was published and dis∣persed
every where; nor were the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> tho' a
learned body, supported by the civil magistrate, and
determined enemies to those opinions, in whose fa∣vour
the miracles were said to have been wrought,
ever able distinctly to refute or detect them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This book was wrote by Mons. de MONTGERON, coun∣sellor or judge of the parliament of PARIS, a man of figure and character, who was also a martyr to the cause, and is now said to be somewhere in a dungeon on account of his book.</P>
<P>There is another book in three volumes (called <HI>Recueil des Miracles de l' Abbé</HI> PARIS) giving an account of many of these miracles, and accompanied with prefatory discourses, which are very well wrote. There runs, however, thro' the whole of these a ridiculous comparison between the miracles of our Saviour and those of the Abbé; wherein 'tis asserted, that the evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former: As if the testimony of men could ever be put in the balance with that of God him∣self, who conducted the pen of the inspired writers. If these writers, indeed, were to be considered merely as human testi∣mony, the FRENCH author is very moderate in his comparison; since he might, with some appearance of reason, pretend, that the JANSENIST miracles much surpass the others in evidence and authority. The following circumstances are drawn from au∣thentic papers, inserted in the above-mentioned book.</P>
<P>Many of the miracles of Abbé PARIS were proved immedi∣ately by witnesses before the officiality or bishop's court of PARIS, under the eye of cardinal NOAILLES, whose character for integrity and capacity was never contested even by his enemies.</P>
<P>His successor in the archbishopric was an enemy to the JAN∣SENISTS, and for that reason promoted to the see by the court. Yet 22 rectors or <HI>cures</HI> of PARIS, with infinite earnestness, press him to examine those miracles, which they assert to be known to the whole world, and indisputably certain: But he wisely forbore.</P>
<P>The MOLINIST party had tried to discredit these miracles in one instance, that of Madamoiselle de FRANC. But, besides that their proceedings were in many respects the most irregular in the world, particularly in citing only a few of the JANSE∣NISTS witnesses, whom they tampered with: Besides this, I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, they soon found themselves overwhelmed by a cloud of new witnesses, one hundred and twenty in number, most of them per∣sons of credit and substance in PARIS, who gave oath for the miracle. This was accompanied with a solemn and earnest ap∣peal to the parliament. But the parliament were forbid by au∣thority to meddle in the affair. It was at last observed that where men are heated by zeal and enthusiasm, there is no de∣gree of human testimony so strong as may not be procured for the greatest absurdity: And those who will be so silly as to examine the affair by that medium, and seek particular flaws in the testi∣mony, are almost sure to be consounded. It must be a miserable imposture, indeed, that does not prevail in that contest.</P>
<P>All who have been in FRANCE about that time have heard of the great reputation of Mons, HERAUT, the <HI>lieutenant de Police,</HI> whose vigilance, penetration, activity, and extensive intelligence have been much talked of. This magistrate, who by the nature of his office is almost absolute, was invested with full powers, on purpose to suppress or discredit these miracles; and he frequently seized immediately, and examined the witnesses and subjects of them: But never could reach any thing satisfactory against them.</P>
<P>In the case of Madamoiselle THIBAUT he sent the famous De SYLVA to examine her; whose evidence is very curious. The physician declares, that it was impossible she could have been so ill as was proved by witnesses; because it was impossible she could, in so short a time, have recovered so perfectly as he found her. He reasoned, like a man of sense, from natural causes; but the opposite party told him, that the whole was a miracle, and that his evidence was the very best proof of it.</P>
<P>The MOLINISTS were in a sad dilemma. They durst not assert the absolute insufficiency of human evidence to prove a miracle. They were obliged to say, that these miracles were wrought by witchcraft and the devil. But they were told, that this was the resource of the JEWS of old.</P>
<P>No JANSENIST was ever embarrassed to account for the ces∣sation of the miracles, when the church-yard was shut up by the king's edict. It was the touch of the tomb, which opera∣ted these extraordinary effects; and when no one could approach the tomb, no effects could be expected. God, indeed, could have thrown down the walls in a moment; but he is master of his own graces and works, and it belongs not to us to account for them. He did not throw down the walls of every city like those of JERICHO, on the sounding of the rams horns, nor break up the prison of every apostle, like that of St. PAUL.</P>
<P>No less a man, than the Duc de CHATILLON, a duke and peer of FRANCE of the highest rank and family, gives evidence of a miraculous cure, performed upon a servant of his, who had lived several years in his house with a visible and palpable in∣firmity.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with observing, that no clergy are more cele∣brated for strictness of life and manners than the secular clergy of FRANCE, particularly the rectors or curés of PARIS, who bear such testimony to these impostures.</P>
<P>The learning, genius, and probity of the gentlemen, and the austerity of the nuns of PORT-ROYAL, have been much cele∣brated all over EUROPE. Yet they all give evidence for a mi∣racle, wrought on the niece of the famous PASCHAL, whose sanctity of life, as well as extraordinary capacity, is well known. The famous RACINE gives an account of this miracle in his famous history of PORT-ROYAL, and fortifies it with all the proofs, which a multitude of nuns, priests, physicians, and men of the world, all of them of undoubted credit, could bestow up∣on it. Several men of letters, particularly the bishop of TOUR∣NAY, thought this miracle so certain, as to employ it in the re∣futation of atheists and free-thinkers. The queen-regent of FRANCE, who was extremely prejudiced against the PORT-ROYAL, sent her own physician to examine the miracle, who returned an absolute convert. In short, the supernatural cure was so uncontestable, that it saved, for a time, that famous mo∣nastery from the ruin with which it was threatened by the Je∣suits. Had it been a cheat, it had certainly been detected by such sagacious and powerful antagonists, and must have hastened the ruin of the contrivers. Our divines, who can build up a formidable castle from such despicable materials; what a prodi∣gious fabric could they have reared from these and many other circumstances, which I have not mentioned! How oft would the great names of PASCHAL, RACINE, ARNAUD, NICOLE, have resounded in our ears? But if they be wise, they had better ad∣opt the miracle, as being more worth, a thousand times, than all the rest of their collection. Besides, it may serve very much to their purpose. For that miracle was really performed by the touch of an authentic holy prickle of the holy thorn, which composed the holy crown, which, &amp;c.</P></NOTE>. Where
<PB N="191" REF="188"/>
shall we find such a number of circumstances, agreeing
to the corroboration of one fact? And what have we
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses, but the abso∣lute
impossibility or miraculous nature of the events,
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
which they relate? And this surely, in the eyes of all
reasonable people, will alone be regarded as a suffi∣cient
refutation.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="191"/>
IS the consequence just, because some human tes∣timony
has the utmost force and authority in some
cases, when it relates the battles of PHILIPPI or
PHARSALIA, for instance; that therefore all kinds
of testimony must, in all cases, have equal force and
authority? Suppose that the CAESAREAN and POM∣PEIAN
factions had, each of them, claimed the vic∣tory
in these battles, and that the historians of each
party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their
own side; how could mankind, at this distance, have
been able to determine between them? The contra∣riety
is equally strong between the miracles related
<PB N="195" REF="192"/>
by HERODOTUS or PLUTARCH, and those delivered
by MARIANA, BEDE, or any monkish historian.</P>
<P>THE wise lend a very academic faith to every re∣port
which favours the passion of the reporter; whe∣ther
it magnifies his country, his family, or himself,
or in any other way strikes in with his natural incli∣nations
and propensities. But what greater tempta∣tion
than to appear a missionary, a prophet, an am∣bassador
from heaven? Who would not encounter
many dangers and difficulties, in order to attain so
sublime a character? Or if, by the help of vanity and
a heated imagination, a man has first made a convert
of himself and entered seriously into the delusion;
who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds, in sup∣port
of so holy and meritorious a cause?</P>
<P>THE smallest spark may here kindle into the great∣est
flame; because the materials are always prepared
for it. The <HI>avidum genus auricularum</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">LUCRET.</NOTE>, the gazing
populace receive greedily, without examination, what∣ever
sooths superstition, and promotes wonder.</P>
<P>HOW many stories of this nature have, in all ages,
been detected and exploded in their infancy? How
many more have been celebrated for a time, and have
afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion? Where
such reports, therefore, fly about, the solution of the
phaenomenon is obvious; and we judge in confor∣mity
<PB N="196" REF="193"/>
to regular experience and observation, when we
account for it by the known and natural principles of
credulity and delusion. And shall we, rather than
have a recourse to so natural a solution, allow of a mi∣raculous
violation of the most established laws of
nature?</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the difficulty of detecting a
falshood in any private or even public history, at the
time and place, where it is said to happen; much
more where the scene is removed to ever so small a
distance. Even a court of judicature, with all the
authority, accuracy, and judgment, which they can
employ, find themselves often at a loss to distinguish
between truth and falshood in the most recent actions.
But the matter never comes to any issue, if trusted
to the common method of altercation and debate and
flying rumours; especially when mens passions have
taken party on either side.</P>
<P>IN the infancy of new religions, the wise and
learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsider∣able
to deserve their attention or regard. And when
afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in
order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the season
is now gone, and the records and witnesses, which
might clear up the matter, have perished beyond
recovery.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="194"/>
NO means of detection remain, but those which
must be drawn from the very testimony itself of the
reporters: And these, tho' always sufficient with the
judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to
fall under the comprehension of the vulgar.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, then, it appears, that no testi∣mony
for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a
probability, much less to a proof; and that, even
supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be op∣posed
by another proof derived from the very nature
of the fact, which it would endeavour to establish.
'Tis experience only, which gives authority to hu∣man
testimony; and 'tis the same experience, which
assures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore,
these two kinds of experience are contrary, we have
nothing to do but substract the one from the other,
and embrace an opinion, either on one side or the
other, with that assurance which arises from the re∣mainder.
But according to the principle here ex∣plained,
this substraction, with regard to all popular
religions, amounts to an intire annihilation; and
therefore we may establish it as a maxim, that no
human testimony can have such force as to prove a
miracle, and make it a just foundation for any such
system of religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I say, that a miracle can never be proved, so as to be the founda∣tion of a system of religion. For I own, that otherwise, there may possibly be miracles, or violations of the usual course of nature, of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony; tho', perhaps, it will be impossible to find any such in all the records of history. Thus, suppose, all authors, in all languages, agree, that from the first of January, 1600, there was a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days: Suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among the People: That all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the same tradition, without the least varia∣tion or contradiction: 'Tis evident, that our present philoso∣phers, instead of doubting of that fact, ought to receive it for certain, and ought to search for the causes whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and dissolution of nature, is an event rendered probable by so many analogies, that any phaeno∣menon, which seems to have a tendency towards that cata∣strophe, comes within the reach of human testimony, if that testimony be very extensive, and uniform.</P>
<P>But suppose, that all the historians, who treat of ENGLAND, should agree, that on the first of JANUARY, 1600, Queen ELI∣ZABETH died; that both before and after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole court, as is usual with per∣sons of her rank; that her successor was acknowleged and pro∣claimed by the parliament; and that, after being interred a month, she again appeared, took possession of the throne, and governed ENGLAND for three years: I must confess, I should be surprized at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other public circumstances that followed it: I should only assert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor possibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the difficulty, and al∣most impossibility of deceiving the world in an affair of such con∣sequence; the wisdom and integrity of that renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice: All this might astonish me; but I would still reply, that the knavery and folly of men are such common phaeno∣mena, that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence, than admit so signal a violation of the laws of nature.</P>
<P>But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of reli∣gion; men, in all ages, have been so much imposed on by ridi∣culous stories of that kind, that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat, and sufficient, with all men of sense, not only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it with∣out farther examination. Tho' the Being to whom the mi∣racle is ascribed, be, in this case, Almighty, it does not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; since 'tis impos∣sible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a being, otherwise than from the experience which we have of his pro∣ductions, in the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation, and obliges us to compare the instances of the violations of truth in the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles, in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this must diminish very much the authority of the former testi∣mony, and make us form a general resolution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever specious pretext it may be co∣vered.</P>
<P>My lord BACON seems to have embraced the same principles of reasoning. <Q REND="inline">"Facienda enim est congeries five historia naturalis particularis omnium monstrorum &amp; partuum naturae prodigi∣osorum; omnis denique novitatis &amp; raritatis &amp; inconsueti in natura.

I AM the better pleased with this method of rea∣soning,
as I think it may serve to confound those
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
dangerous friends or disguised enemies to the <HI>Christ∣ian
Religion,</HI> who have undertaken to defend it by
<PB N="200" REF="197"/>
the principles of human reason. Our most holy reli∣gion
is founded on <HI>Faith,</HI> not on reason; and 'tis a
sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as
it is, by no means, fitted to endure. To make this
more evident, let us examine those miracles, related
in scripture; and not to lose ourselves in too wide a
field, let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the
<HI>Pentateuch,</HI> which we shall examine, according to the
principles of these pretended Christians, not as the
word or testimony of God himself, but as the pro∣duction
of a mere human writer and historian. Here
then we are first to consider a book, presented to us
<PB N="201" REF="198"/>
by a barbarous and ignorant people, wrote in an age
when they were still more barbarous, and in all pro∣bability
long after the facts which it relates; corro∣borated
by no concurring testimony, and resembling
those fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of
its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full
of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a
state of the world and of human nature intirely dif∣ferent
from the present: Of our fall from that state:
Of the age of man, extended to near a thousand
years: Of the destruction of the world by a deluge:
Of the arbitrary choice of one people, a the favour∣ites
of heaven; and that people, the countrymen of
the author: Of their deliverance from bondage by
prodigies the most astonishing imaginable: I desire
any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after se∣rious
consideration declare, whether he thinks, that
the falshood of such a book, supported by such a tes∣timony,
would be more extraordinary and miraculous
than all the miracles it relates; which is, however,
necessary to make it be received, according to the
measures of probability above established.</P>
<P>WHAT we have said of miracles may be applied,
without any variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all
prophecies are real miracles, and as such only, can be
admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not
exceed the capacity of human nature to foretel future
events, it would be absurd to employ any prophecy
<PB N="202" REF="199"/>
as an argument for a divine mission or authority from
heaven. So that, upon the whole, we may conclude,
that the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> not only was at first attended
with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed
by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason
is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: And
whoever is moved by <HI>Faith</HI> to assent to it is conscious
of a continued miracle in his own person, which sub∣verts
all the principles of his understanding, and gives
him a determination to believe what is most contrary

<HEAD>SECTION XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a PARTICULAR PROVIDENCE and of a
FUTURE STATE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS lately engaged in conversation with a friend
who loves sceptical paradoxes; where, tho' he ad∣vanced
many principles, of which I can by no means
approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear
some relation to the chain of reasoning carried on
thro' this enquiry, I shall here copy them from my
memory as accurately as I can, in order to submit
them to the judgment of the reader.</P>
<P>OUR conversation began with my admiring the
singular good fortune of philosophy, which, as it re∣quires
intire liberty, above all other privileges, and
flourishes chiefly from the free opposition of senti∣ments
and argumentation, received its first birth in an
age and country of freedom and toleration, and was
never cramped, even in its most extravagant prin∣ciples,
by any creeds, confessions, or penal statutes.
For except the banishment of PROTAGORAS, and the
<PB N="204" REF="201"/>
death of SOCRATES, which last event proceeded
partly from other motives, there are scarce any in∣stances
to be met with, in antient history, of this bi∣gotted
jealousy, with which the present age is so much
infested. EPICURUS lived at ATHENS to an advan∣ced
age, in peace and tranquillity: EPICUREANS
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LUCIANI <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal charac∣ter,
and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred
rites of the established religion: And the public en∣couragement<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> of pensions and salaries was afforded
equally, by the wisest of all the ROMAN emperors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. &amp; Dio.</NOTE>,
to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How re∣quisite
such kind of treatment was to philosophy, in
its first origin, will easily be conceived, if we reflect,
that even at present, when it may be supposed more
hardy and robust, it bears with much difficulty the in∣clemency
of the seasons, and those harsh winds of ca∣lumny
and persecution, which blow upon it.</P>
<P>YOU admire, says my friend, as the singular good
fortune of philosophy, what seems to result from the
natural course of things, and to be unavoidable in
every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of
which you complain, as so fatal to philosophy, is re∣ally
her offspring, who, after allying with superstition,
separates himself intirely from the interest of his pa∣rent,
and becomes her most inveterate enemy and
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
persecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the pre∣sent
occasions of such furious dispute, could not pos∣sibly
be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the
world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate,
formed an idea of religion, more suitable to their
weak apprehension, and composed their sacred tenets
chiefly of such tales as were the objects of traditional
belief, more than of argument or disputation. After the
first alarm, therefore, was over, which arose from
the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers;
these teachers seem ever after, during the ages of an∣tiquity,
to have lived in great harmony with the esta∣blished
superstitions, and to have made a fair partition
of mankind between them; the former claiming all
the learned and the wise, and the latter possessing all
the vulgar and illiterate.</P>
<P>IT seems then, says I, that you leave politics intirely
out of the question, and never suppose, that a wise
magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of
philosophy, such as those of EPICURUS, which deny∣ing
a divine existence, and consequently a providence
and a future state, seem to loosen, in a great measure,
the ties of morality, and may be supposed, for that
reason, pernicious to the peace of civil society.</P>
<P>I KNOW, replied he, that in fact these persecutions
never, in any age, proceeded from calm reason, or
any experience of the pernicious consequences of phi∣losophy;
<PB N="206" REF="203"/>
but arose intirely from passion and pre∣judice.
But what if I should advance farther, and
assert, that if EPICURUS had been accused before the
people, by any of the <HI>sycophants</HI> or informers of those
days, he could easily have defended his cause, and
proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary
as those of his adversaries, who endeavoured, with
such zeal, to expose him to the public hatred and
jealousy?</P>
<P>I WISH, said I, you would try your eloquence up∣on
so extraordinary a topic, and make a speech for
EPICURUS, which might satisfy, not the mob of
ATHENS, if you will allow that antient and polite
city to have contained any mob, but the more philo∣sophical
part of his audience, such as might be sup∣posed
capable of comprehending his arguments.</P>
<P>THE matter would not be difficult, upon such con∣ditions,
replied he: And if you please, I shall sup∣pose
myself EPICURUS for a moment, and make you
stand for the ATHENIAN people, and shall deliver
you such an harangue as will fill all the urn with white
beans, and leave not a black one to gratify and malice
of my adversaries.</P>
<P>VERY well: Pray proceed upon these supposi∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="204"/>
I COME hither, O ye ATHENIANS, to justify in
your assembly what I maintained in my school, and
find myself impeached by furious antagonists, instead
of reasoning with calm and dispassionate inquirers.
Your deliberations, which of right should be directed
to questions of public good, and the interest of the
commonwealth, are diverted to the disquisitions of
speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but
perhaps fruitless inquiries, take place of your more
familiar but more useful occupations. But so far as in
me lies, I will prevent this abuse. We shall not herre
dispute concerning the origin and government of
worlds. We shall only inquire how far such questions
concern the public interest. And if I can persuade
you, that they are intirely indifferent to the peace of
society and security of government, I hope that you
will presently send us back to our schools, there to ex∣amine
at leisure the question the most sublime, but, at
the same time, the most speculative of all philosophy.</P>
<P>THE religious philosophers, not satisfied with the
traditions of your forefathers, and doctrines of your
priests (in which I willingly acquiesce) indulge a rash
curiosity, in trying how far they can establish religion
upon the principles of reason; and they thereby ex∣cite,
instead of satisfying, the doubts, which naturally
arise from a diligent and scrutinous inquiry. They
paint, in the most magnificent colours, the order,
beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and
<PB N="208" REF="205"/>
then ask, if such a glorious display of intelligence
could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms,
or if chance could produce what the highest genius
can never sufficiently admire. I shall not examine
the justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be
as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire.
'Tis sufficient, if I can prove, from this very reason∣ing,
that the question is intirely speculative, and that
when, in my philosophical disquisitions, I deny a pro∣vidence
and a future state, I undermine not the foun∣dations
of society, but advance principles, which
they themselves, upon their own topics, if they argue
consistently, must allow to be solid and satisfactory.</P>
<P>YOU then, who are my accusers, have acknowleged,
that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence
(which I never questioned) is derived from the order
of nature; where there appear such marks of intelli∣gence
and design, that you think it extravagant to as∣sign
for its cause, either chance, or the blind and un∣guided
force of matter. You allow, that this is an
argument drawn from effects to causes. From the
order of the work you infer, that there must have
been project and forethought in the workman. If
you cannot make out this point, you allow, that your
conclusion fails; and you pretend not to establish the
conclusion in a greater latitude than the phaenomena of
nature will justify. These are your concessions. I
desire you to mark the consequences.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="206"/>
WHEN we infer any particular cause from an ef∣fect,
we must proportion the one to the other, and
can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause any qua∣lities,
but what are exactly sufficient to produce the
effect. A body of ten ounces raised in any scale may
serve as a proof, that the counterbalancing weight ex∣ceeds
ten ounces; but can never afford a reason that
it exceeds a hundred. If the cause, assigned for any
effect, be not sufficient to produce it, we must either
reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will
give it a just proportion to the effect. But if we
ascribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of
producing other effects, we can only indulge the li∣cence
of conjecture, and arbitrarily suppose the exis∣tence
of qualities and energies, without reason or au∣thority.</P>
<P>THE
same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be
brute unconscious matter, or a rational intelligent
being. If the cause be known only by the effect, we
never ought to assign to it any qualities, beyond what
are precisely requisite to produce the effect: Nor can
we, by any rules of just reasoning, return back from
the cause, and infer other effects from it, beyond those
by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely
from the sight of one of ZEUXIS's pictures, could
know, that he was also a statuary or architect, and
was an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in
colours. The talents and taste displayed in the par∣ticular
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
work before us; these we may safely conclude
the workman to be possessed of. The cause must be
proportioned to the effect: And if we exactly and
precisely proportion it, we shall never find in it any
qualities that point farther, or afford an inference con∣cerning
any other design or performance. Such qua∣lities
must be somewhat beyond what is merely requi∣site
to produce the effect which we examine.</P>
<P>ALLOWING, therefore, the gods to be the authors of
the existence or order of the universe; it follows, that
they possess that precise degree of power, intelligence,
and benevolence, which appears in their workman∣ship;
but nothing farther can ever be proved, except
we call in the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to
supply the defects of argument and reasoning. So far
as the traces of any attributes, at present, appear, so
far may we conclude these attributes to exist. The
supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis;
much more, the supposition, that, in distant periods of
place and time, there has been, or will be, a more
magnificent display of these attributes, and a scheme
of administration more suitable to such imaginary vir∣tues.
We can never be allowed to mount up from
the universe, the effect, to JUPITER, the cause; and
then descend downwards, to infer any new effect from
that cause; as if the present effects alone were not in∣tirely
worthy of the glorious attributes which we as∣cribe
to that deity. The knowlege of the cause being
<PB N="211" REF="208"/>
derived solely from the effect, they must be exactly ad∣justed
to each other, and the one can never refer to
any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new in∣ference
and conclusion.</P>
<P>YOU find certain phaenomena in nature. You seek
a cause or author. You imagine that you have found
him. You afterwards become so enamoured of this
offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impos∣sible
but he must produce something greater and more
perfect than the present scene of things, which is so
full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this super∣lative
intelligence and benevolence are intirely ima∣ginary,
or, at least, without any foundation in reason;
and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any
qualities, but what you see he has actually exerted
and displayed in his productions. Let your gods,
therefore, O philosophers, be suited to the present
appearances of nature: And presume not to alter
these appearances by arbitrary suppositions, in order
to suit them to the attributes, which you so fondly
ascribe to your deities.</P>
<P>WHEN priests and poets, supported by your autho∣rity,
O ATHENIANS, talk of a golden or a silver age,
which preceded the present scene of vice and misery,
I hear them with attention and with reverence. But
when philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority,
and to cultivate reason, hold the same discourse, I pay
<PB N="212" REF="209"/>
them not, I own, the same obsequious submission and
pious deference. I ask; Who carried them into the
celestial regions, who admitted them into the councils
of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate,
that they thus rashly affirm that their deities have exe∣cuted,
or will execute, any purpose, beyond what has
actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have
mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of rea∣son,
and by drawing inferences from effects to causes,
I still insist, that they have aided the ascent of reason
by the wings of imagination; otherwise they could
not thus change their manner of inference, and argue
from causes to effect; presuming, that a more perfect
production than the present world would be more sui∣table
to such perfect beings as the gods, and forget∣ting,
that they have no reason to ascribe to these celes∣tial
beings any perfection or any attribute, but what
can be found in the present world.</P>
<P>HENCE all the fruitless industry to account for the
ill appearances of nature, and save the honour of the
gods; while we must acknowlege the reality of that
evil and disorder, with which the world so much a∣bounds.
The obstinate and intractable qualities of
matter, we are told, or the observance of general laws;
or some such reason, is the sole cause, which controlled
the power and benevolence of JUPITER, and obliged
him to create mankind and every sensible creature so
imperfect and so unhappy. These attributes, then,
<PB N="213" REF="210"/>
are, it seems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their
greatest latitude. And upon that supposition, I own,
that such conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as
plausible solutions of the ill phaenomena▪ But still I
ask; Why take these attributes for granted, or why
ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually ap∣pear
in the effect? Why torture your brain to justify
the course of nature upon suppositions, which, for
aught you know, may be intirely imaginary, and of
which there are to be found no traces in the course of
nature?</P>
<P>THE religious hypothesis, therefore, must be consi∣dered
only as a particular method of accounting for
the visible phaenomena of the universe: But no just
reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single
fact, and alter or add to the phaenomena, in any single
particular. If you think, that the appearances of
things prove such causes, 'tis allowable for you to draw
an inference concerning the existence of these causes.
In such complicated and sublime subjects, every one
should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and ar∣gument.
But here you ought to rest. If you come
backward, and arguing from your inferred causes,
conclude, that any other fact has existed, or will exist,
display of particular attributes; I must admonish you,
that you have departed from the method of reason∣ing,
attached to the present subject, and must certainly
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
have added something to the attributes of the cause,
beyond what appears in the effect; otherwise you
could never, with tolerable sense or propriety, add
any thing to the effect, in order to render it more
worthy of the cause.</P>
<P>WHERE, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine,
which I teach in my school, or rather, which I exa∣mine
in my gardens? Or what do you find in this
whole question, wherein the security of good morals,
or the peace and order of society is in the least con∣cerned?</P>
<P>I
DENY a providence, you say, and supreme go∣vernour
of the world, who guides the course of e∣vents,
and punishes the vicious with infamy and dis∣appointment,
and rewards the virtuous with honour
and success, in all their undertakings. But surely; I
deny not the course itself of events, which lies open
to every one's inquiry and examination. I acknow∣lege,
that, in the present order of things, virtue is
attended with more peace of mind than vice; and
meets with a more favourable reception from the
world. I am sensible, that, according to the past ex∣perience
of mankind, friendship is the chief joy of
human life, and moderation the only source of tran∣quillity
and happiness. I never balance between the
virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sen∣sible,
that, to a well disposed mind, every advantage
<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
is on the side of the former. And what can you say
more, allowing all your suppositions and reasonings?
You tell me, indeed, that this disposition of things
proceeds from intelligence and design. But whatever
it proceeds from, the disposition itself, on which de∣pends
our happiness or misery, and consequently our
conduct and deportment in life, is still the same. 'Tis
still open for me, as well as you, to regulate my be∣haviour,
by my experience of past events. And if
you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed,
and a supreme distributive justice in the universe, I
ought to expect some more particular reward of the
good, and punishment of the bad, beyond the ordi∣nary
course of events; I here find the same fallacy,
which I have before endeavoured to detect. You per∣sist
in imagining, that, if we grant that divine exis∣tence,
for which you so earnestly contend, you may
safely infer consequences from it, and add something
to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from
the attributes which you ascribe to your gods. You
seem not to remember, that all your reasonings on
this subject can only be drawn from effects to causes;
and that every argument, deduced from causes to ef∣fects,
must of necessity be a gross sophism; since it is
impossible for you to know any thing of the cause, but
what you have, antecedently, not inferred, but dis∣covered
to the full, in the effect.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="213"/>
BUT what must a philosopher judge of those vain
reasoners, who, instead of regarding the present scene
of things as the sole object of their contemplation, so
far reverse the whole course of nature, as to render
this life merely a passage to something farther; a
porch, which leads to a greater, and vastly different
building; a prologue, which serves only to introduce
the piece, and give it more grace and propriety?
Whence, do you think, can such philosophers derive
their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and
imagination surely. For if they derived it from the
present phaenomena, it would never point to any thing
farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them. That
the divinity may <HI>possibly</HI> possess attributes, which we
have never seen exerted; may be governed by prin∣ciples
of action, which we cannot discover to be sa∣tisfied:
All this will freely be allowed. But still this
is mere <HI>possibility</HI> and hypothesis. We never can have
reason to <HI>infer</HI> any attributes, or any principles of ac∣tion
in him, but so far as we know them to have been
exerted and satisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the
world?</HI> If you answer in the affirmative, I conclude,
that, since justice here exerts itself, it is satisfied. If
you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have
then no reason to ascribe justice to the gods. If you
hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by
saying, that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts
<PB N="217" REF="214"/>
itself in part, but not in its full extent; I answer, that
you have no reason to give it any particular extent,
but only so far as you see it, <HI>at present,</HI> exert itself.</P>
<P>THUS I bring the dispute, O ATHENIANS, to a
short issue with my antagonists. The course of nature
lies open to my contemplation as well as theirs. The
experienced train of events is the great standard by
which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing else can
be appealed to in the field, or in the senate. Nothing
else ought ever to be heard of in the school, or in the
closet. In vain would our limited understandings
break thro' those boundaries, which are too narrow
for our fond imaginations. While we argue from the
course of nature, and infer a particular intelligent
cause, which first bestowed, and still preserves order in
the universe, we embrace a principle which is both
uncertain and useless. 'Tis uncertain; because the
subject lies intirely beyond the reach of human expe∣rience.
'Tis useless; because our knowlege of this
cause being derived intirely from the course of na∣ture,
we can never, according to the rules of just rea∣soning,
return back from the cause with any new in∣ferences,
or making additions to the common and
experienced course of nature, establish any new princi∣ples
of conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>I OBSERVE (says I, finding he had finished his ha∣rangue)
that you neglect not the artifice of the dema∣gogues
<PB N="218" REF="215"/>
of old; and as you was pleased to make me
stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my
favour, by embracing those principles, to which, you
know, I have always expressed a particular attach∣ment.
But allowing you to make experience (as in∣deed
I think you ought) the only standard of our judg∣ment
concerning this, and all other questions of fact;
I doubt not but, from the very same experience, to
which you appeal, it may be possible to refute this
reasoning, which you have put into the mouth of
EPICURUS. If you saw, for instance, a half-finished
building surrounded with heaps of brick and stone
and mortar, and all the instruments of masonry;
could you not <HI>infer</HI> from the effect, that it was a work
of design and contrivance? And could you not return
again, from this inferred cause, to infer new additions
to the effect, and conclude, that the building would
soon be finished, and receive all the farther improve∣ments,
which art could bestow upon it? If you saw
upon the sea-shore the print of one human foot, you
would conclude, that a man had passed that way, and
that he had also left the traces of the other foot, tho'
effaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the
waters. Why then do you refuse to admit the same
method of reasoning with regard to the order of na∣ture?
Consider the world and the present life only as
an imperfect building, from which you can infer a
superior intelligence; and arguing from that superior
intelligence, which can have nothing imperfect; why
<PB N="219" REF="216"/>
may you not infer a more finished scheme or plan,
which will receive its completion in some distant pe∣riod
of space or time? Are not these methods of rea∣soning
exactly parallel? And under what pretext can
you embrace the one, while you reject the other?</P>
<P>THE infinite difference of the subjects, replied he,
is a sufficient foundation for this difference in my con∣clusions.
In works of <HI>human</HI> art and contrivance, 'tis
allowable to advance from the effect to the cause, and
returning back from the cause, form new inferences
concerning the effect, and examine the alterations
which it has probably undergone, or may still under∣go.
But what is the foundation of this method of
reasoning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom
we know by experience, whose motives and designs
we are acquainted with, and whose projects and incli∣nations
have a certain connexion and coherence, ac∣cording
to the laws which nature has established for
the government of such a creature. When, there∣fore,
we find, that any work has proceeded from the
skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise ac∣quainted
with the nature of the animal, we can draw a
hundred inferences concerning what may be expected
from him; and these inferences will all be founded on
experience and observation. But did we know man
only from the single work or production which we ex∣amine,
it were impossible for us to argue in this man∣ner;
because our knowlege of all the qualities, which
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
we ascribe to him, being in that case derived from the
production, 'tis impossible they could point to any
thing farther, or be the foundation of any new infer∣ences.
The print of a foot in the sand can only
prove, when considered alone, that there was some
figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: But
the print of a human foot proves likewise, from our
other experience, that there was probably another
foot, which also left its impression, tho' effaced by
time or other accide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s. Here we mount from the ef∣fect
to the cause, and descending again from the
cause, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a
continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning.
We comprehend in this case a hundred other expe∣riences
and observations, concerning the <HI>usual</HI> figure
and members of that species of animal, without which
this method of argument must be considered as falla∣cious
and sophistical.</P>
<P>THE case is not the same with our reasonings from
the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only
by his productions, and is a single being in the uni∣verse,
not comprehended under any species or genus,
from whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can,
by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As
the universe shews wisdom and goodness, we infer
wisdom and goodness. As it shows a particular degree
of these perfections, we infer a particular degree of
them, precisely adapted to the effect which we exa∣mine.
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
But farther attributes or farther degrees of the
same attributes, we can never be authorised to infer or
suppose, by any rules of just reasoning. Now without
some such licence of supposition, 'tis impossible for
us to argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in
the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under
our observation. Greater good produced by this Be∣ing
must still prove a greater degree of goodness:
More impartial distribution of rewards and punish∣ments
must proceed from a superior regard to justice
and equity. Every supposed addition to the works of
nature makes an addition to the attributes of the au∣thor
of nature; and consequently, being intirely un
supported by any reason or argument, can never be
admitted but as mere conjecture and hypothesis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In general, it may, I think, be established as a maxim, that where any cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, it must be impossible to infer any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> since the qualities, which are requisite to produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> new ef∣fects along with the former, must either be different, or supe∣rior, or of more extensive operation, than those which simply produced the effect, whence alone the cause is supposed to be known to us. We can never, therefore, have any reason to sup∣pose the existence of these qualities. To say that the new effects proceed only from a continuation of the same energy, which is already known from the first effects, will not remove the diffi∣culty. For even granting this to be the case, (which can sel∣dom be supposed) the very continuation and exertion of a like energy (for 'tis impossible it can be absolutely the same) I say, this exertion of a like energy in a different period of space and time is a very arbitrary supposition, and what there cannot pos∣sibly be any traces of in the effects, from which all our know∣lege of the cause is originally derived. Let the <HI>inferred</HI> cause be exactly proportioned (as it should be) to the known effect; and 'tis impossible that it can possess any qualities, from which new or different effects can be <HI>inferred.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="219"/>
THE great source of our mistake in this subject, and
of the unbounded licence of conjecture, which we in∣dulge,
is, that we tacitly consider ourselves, as in the
place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he
will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct,
which we ourselves, in his situation, would have em∣braced
as reasonable and eligible. But besides, that
the ordinary course of nature may convince us, that
almost every thing is regulated by principles and max∣ims
very different from ours; besides this, I say, it
must evidently appear contrary to all rule of analogy
to reason, from the intentions and projects of men, to
those of a being so different, and so much superior.
In human nature, there is a certain experienced cohe∣rence
of designs and inclinations; so that when, from
any facts, we have discovered one intention of any man,
it may often be reasonable, from experience, to infer
another, and draw a long chain of conclusions con∣cerning
his past or future conduct. But this method
of reasoning never can have place with regard to a
<PB N="223" REF="220"/>
Being, so remote and incomprehensible, who bears
much less analogy to any other being in the universe
than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers him∣self
only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond
which we have no authority to ascribe to him any at∣tribute
or perfection. What we imagine to be a su∣perior
perfection may really be a defect. Or were it
ever so much a perfection, the ascribing it to the Su∣preme
Being, where it appears not to have been real∣ly
exerted, to the full, in his works, favours more of
flattery and panegyric, than of just reasoning and sound
philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, in the
world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a
species of philosophy, will never be able to carry us
beyond the usual course of experience, or give us mea∣sures
of conduct and behaviour different from those
which are furnished by reflections on common life.
No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious
hypothesis; no event foreseen or foretold; no reward
or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is
already known by practice and observation. So that
my apology for EPICURUS will still appear solid and
satisfactory; nor have the political interest of society
any connexion with the philosophical disputes con∣cerning
metaphysics and religion.</P>
<P>THERE is still one circumstance, replied I, which
you seem to have overlooked. I ho' I should allow
your premises, I must still deny your conclusion. You
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings <HI>can</HI>
have no influence on life, because they <HI>ought</HI> to have
no influence; never considering, that men reason not
in the same manner you do, but draw many conse∣quences
from the belief of a divine existence, and sup∣pose
that the Deity will inflict punishments on vice,
and bestow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in
the ordinary course of nature. Whether this reason∣ing
of their be just or not, is no matter. Its influ∣ence
on their life and conduct must still be the same.
And those, who attempt to disabuse them of such pre∣judices,
may, for aught I know, be good reasoners,
but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and poli∣ticians;
since they free men from one restraint upon
their passions, and make the infringement of the laws
of society, in one respect, more easy and secure.</P>
<P>AFTER all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general
conclusion in favour of liberty, tho' upon different pre∣mises
from those, on which you endeavour to found it.
I think that the state ought to tolerate every principle
of philosophy; nor is there an instance that any go∣vernment
has suffered in its political interests by such
indulgence. There is no enthusiasm among philo∣sophers;
their doctrines are not very alluring to the
people; and no restraint can be put upon their rea∣sonings,
but what must be of dangerous consquence
to the sciences, and even to the state, by paving the
way for persecution and oppression in points where the
<PB N="225" REF="222"/>
generality of mankind are more deeply interested and
concerned.</P>
<P>BUT there occurs to me (continued I) with regard
to your main topic, a difficulty, which I shall just pro∣pose
to you, without insisting on it; left it lead into
reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a
word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause
to be known only by its effect (as you have all along
supposed) or to be of so singular and particular a na∣ture
as to have no parallel and no similarity with any
other cause or object, that has ever fallen under out
observation. 'Tis only when two <HI>species</HI> of objects
are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can in∣fer
the one from the other; and were an effect pre∣sented,
which was intirely singular, and could not be
comprehended under any known <HI>species,</HI> I do not see,
that we could form any conjecture or inference at all
concerning its cause. If experience and observation
and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can
reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both
the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resem∣blance
to other effects and causes which we know,
and which we have found, in many instances, to be
conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own
reflections to pursue the consequences of this principle.
I shall just observe, that as the antagonists of EPI∣CURUS
always suppose the universe an effect quite sin∣gular
and unparalleled; to be the proof of a Deity, a
<PB N="226" REF="223"/>
cause no less singular and unparalleled; your reason∣ings,
upon that supposition, seem, at least, to merit
our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how
we can ever return from the cause to the effect, and
reasoning from our ideas of the former, infer any al∣teration
on the latter, or any addition to it.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ACADEMICAL or SCEPTICAL PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not a greater number of philosophical
reasonings, displayed upon any subject, than
those, which prove the existence of a Deity, and re∣fute
the fallacies of <HI>Atheists;</HI> and yet the most reli∣gious
philosophers still dispute whether any man can
be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How
shall we reconcile these contradictions? The knight∣errants,
who wandered about to clear the world of
dragons and giants, never entertained the least doubt
with regard to the existence of these monsters.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sceptic</HI> is another enemy of religion, who na∣turally
provokes the indignation of all divines and
graver philosophers; tho' 'tis certain, that no man
ever met with any such absurd creature, or conversed
with a man, who had no opinion or principle con∣cerning
<PB N="228" REF="225"/>
any subject, either of action or speculation.
This begets a very natural question; What is meant
by a sceptic? And how far it is possible to push these
philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?</P>
<P>THERE is a species of scepticism, <HI>antecedent</HI> to all
study and philosophy, which is much inculcated by
DES CARTES and others, as a sovereign preserva∣tive
against error and precipitate judgment. It recom∣mends
an universal doubt, not only of all our former
opinions and principles, but also of our very faculties;
of whose veracity, say they, we must assure ourselves,
by a chain of reasoning, deduced from some original
principle, which cannot possibly be fallacious or de∣ceitful.
But neither is there any such original prin∣ciple,
which has a prerogative above others, that are
self-evident and convincing: Or if there were, could
we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of these
very faculties, of which we are supposed to be already
diffident. The CARTESIAN doubt, therefore, were
it ever possible to be attained by any human creature
(as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable;
and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of
assurance and conviction upon any subject.</P>
<P>IT must, however, be confessed, that this species of
scepticism, when more moderate, may be understood
in a very reasonable sense, and is a necessary prepara∣tive
to the study of philosophy, by preserving a pro∣per
<PB N="229" REF="226"/>
impartiality in our judgments, and weaning our
mind from all those prejudices, which we may have
imbibed from education or rash opinion. To begin
with clear and self-evident principles, to advance by
timorous and sure steps, to review frequently our con∣clusions,
and examine accurately all their consequences;
tho' by this means we shall make both a slow and a
short progress in our systems; are the only methods,
by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and attain
a proper stability and certainty in our determina∣tions.</P>
<P>THERE
is another species of scepticism, <HI>consequent</HI>
to science and enquiry, where men are supposed to
have discovered, either the absolute fallaciousness of
their mental faculties, or their unfitness to reach any
fixed determination in all those curious subjects of
speculation, about which they are commonly em∣ployed.
Even our very senses are brought into dis∣pute,
by a certain species of philosophers; and the
maxims of common life are subjected to the same
doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions
of metaphysics and theology. As these paradoxical
tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met
with in some philosophers, and the refutation of them
in several, they naturally excite our curiosity, and
make us enquire into the arguments, on which they
may be founded.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="227"/>
I NEED not insist upon the more trite topics, em∣ployed
by the sceptics in all ages, against the evidence
of <HI>sense;</HI> such as those derived from the imperfection
and fallaciousness of our organs, on numberless occa∣sions;
the crooked appearance of an oar in water;
the various aspects of objects, according to their dif∣ferent
distances; the double images which arise from
the pressing one eye; with many other appearances
of a like nature. These sceptical topics, indeed, are
only sufficient to prove, that the senses alone are not
implicitely to be depended on; but that we must
correct their evidence by reason, and by considerations,
derived from the nature of the medium, the distance
of the object, and the disposition of the organ, in
order to render them, within their sphere, the proper
<HI>criteria</HI> of truth and falshood. There are other more
profound arguments against the senses, which admit
not of so easy a solution.</P>
<P>IT seems evident, that men are carried, by a natu∣ral
instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their
senses; and that, without any reasoning, or even al∣most
before the use of reason, we always suppose an
external universe, which depends not on our percep∣tion,
but would exist, tho' we and every sensible crea∣ture
were absent or annihilated. Even the animal
creation are governed by a like opinion, and preserve
this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts,
designs, and actions.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="228"/>
IT seems also evident, that when men follow this
blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always
suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to
be the external objects, and never entertain any sus∣picion,
that the one are nothing but representations
of the other. This very table, which we see white,
and which we feel hard, is believed to exist, indepen∣dent
of our perception, and to be something external
to our mind, which perceives it. Our presence be∣stows
not being on it: Our absence annihilates it not.
It preserves its existence uniform and entire, indepen∣dent
of the situation of intelligent beings, who per∣ceive
or contemplate it.</P>
<P>BUT this universal and primary opinion of all men
is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which
teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the
mind but an image or perception, and that the senses
are only the inlets, thro' which these images are re∣ceived,
without being ever able to produce any im∣mediate
intercourse between the mind and the object.
The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as we
remove farther from it: But the real table which ex∣ists
independent of us, suffers no alteration: It was,
therefore, nothing but its image, which was present
to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of rea∣son;
and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that
the existences, which we consider, when we say, <HI>this
house</HI> and <HI>that tree</HI> are nothing but perceptions in the
<PB N="232" REF="229"/>
mind, and fleeting copies or representations of other
existences, which remain uniform and independent.</P>
<P>So far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to
contradict or depart from the primary instincts of na∣ture,
and to embrace a new system with regard to the
evidences of our senses. But here philosophy finds
itself extremely embarrassed, when it would justify
this new system, and obviate the cavils and objections
of the sceptics. It can no longer plead the infallible
and irresistible instinct of nature: For that led us to
a quite different system, which is acknowledged fal∣lible
and even erroneous. And to justify this pre∣tended
philosophical system, by a chain of clear and
convincing argument, or even any appearance of ar∣gument,
exceeds the power of all human capacity.</P>
<P>BY what argument can it be proved, that the per∣ceptions
of the mind must be caused by external ob∣jects,
entirely different from them, tho' resembling
them (if that be possible) and could not arise either
from the energy of the mind itself, or from the sug∣gestion
of some invisible and unknown spirit, or from
some other cause still more unknown to us? 'Tis ac∣knowledged,
that, in fact, many of these perceptions
arise not from any thing external, as in dreams,
madness, and other diseases. And nothing can be
more inexplicable than the manner, in which body
should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an
<PB N="233" REF="230"/>
image of itself to a substance supposed of so different,
and even contrary a nature.</P>
<P>'TIS a question of fact, whether the perceptions
of the senses be produced by external objects, resem∣bling
them: How shall this question be determined?
By experience surely; as all other questions of a like
nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely
silent. The mind has never any thing present to it
but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any
experience of their connexion with objects. The sup∣position
of such a connexion is, therefore, without
any foundation in reasoning.</P>
<P>To have recourse to the veracity of the supreme
Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses,
is surely making a very unexpected circuit. If his
veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our
senses would be entirely infallible; because it is not
possible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention,
that if the external world be once called in doubt,
we shall be at a loss to find arguments, by which we
may prove the existence of that Being or any of his
attributes.</P>
<P>THIS is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder
and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph,
when they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt
into all subjects of human knowlege and enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="231"/>
Do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature,
may they say, in assenting to the veracity of sense?
But these lead you to believe, that the very perception
or sensible image is the external object. Do you dis∣claim
this principle, in order to embrace a more ra∣tional
opinion, that the perceptions are only represen∣tations
of something external? You here depart from
your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments;
and yet are not able to satisfy your reason, which can
never find any convincing argument from experience
to prove, that the perceptions are connected with any
external objects.</P>
<P>THERE is another sceptical topic of a like nature,
derived from the most profound philosophy; which
might merit our attention, were it requisite to dive so
deep, in order to discover arguments and reasonings,
which can serve so little any serious purpose. 'Tis
universally allowed by modern enquiers, that all the
sensible qualities of objects, such as hard, soft, hot,
cold, white, black, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are merely secondary, and
exist not in the objects themselves, but are perceptions
of the mind, without any external archetype or model,
which they represent. If this be allowed, with regard
to secondary qualities, it must also follow with regard to
the supposed primary qualities of extension and solidity;
nor can the latter be any more entitled to that deno∣mination
than the former. The idea of extension is
entirely acquired from the senses of sight and feeling;
<PB N="235" REF="232"/>
and if all the qualities, perceived by the senses, be in
the mind, not in the object, the same conclusion
must reach the idea of extension, which is wholly de∣pendent
on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secon∣dary
qualities. Nothing can save us from this con∣clusion,
but the asserting, that the ideas of those pri∣mary
qualities are attained by <HI>Abstraction;</HI> which, if
we examine accurately, we shall find to be unintel∣ligible,
and even absurd. An extension, that is nei∣ther
tangible nor visible, cannot possibly be conceived:
And a tangible or visible extension, which is neither
hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the
reach of human conception. Let any man try to
conceive a triangle in general, which is neither <HI>Isoceles,</HI>
nor <HI>Scalenum,</HI> nor has any particular length nor pro∣portion
of sides; and he will soon perceive the ab∣surdity
of all the scholastic notions with regard to ab∣straction
and general ideas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This argument is drawn from Dr. BERKLEY; and ideed most of the writings of that very ingenious author form the best lessons of scepticism, which are to be found either among the antient or modern philosophers, BAYLE not excepted. He pro∣fesses, however, in his title-page (and undoubtedly with great truth) to have composed his book against the sceptics as well as against the atheists and free-thinkers. But that all his argu∣ments, tho' otherwise intended, are, in reality, merely scepti∣cal, appears from this, <HI>that they admit of no answer and produce no conviction.</HI> Their only effect is to cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion, which is the result of scepticism.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="233"/>
THUS the first philosophical objection to the evi∣dence
of sense or to the opinion of external existence
consists in this, that such an opinion, if rested on na∣tural
instinct, is contrary to reason, and if referred to
reason, is contrary to natural instinct, and at the same
time carries no rational evidence with it, to convince
an impartial enquirer. The second objection goes
farther, and represents this opinion as contrary to rea∣son;
at least, if it be a principle of reason, that all
sensible qualities are in the mind, not in the object.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>IT may seem a very extravagant attempt of the
sceptics to destroy <HI>reason</HI> by argument and ratiocina∣tion;
yet is this the grand scope of all their enquiries
and disputes. They endeavour to find objections,
both to our abstract reasonings, and to those which
regard matter of fact and existence.</P>
<P>THE chief objection against all <HI>abstract</HI> reasonings
is derived from the ideas of space and time; ideas,
which, in common life and to a careless view, are
very clear and intelligible, but when they pass thro'
the scrutiny of the profound sciences (and they are
the chief object of these sciences) afford principles
which seem full of absurdity and contradiction. No
priestly <HI>dogmas,</HI> invented on purpose to tame and
<PB N="237" REF="234"/>
subdue the rebellious reason of mankind, ever shocked
common sense more than the doctrine of the infinite
divisibility of extension, with its consequences; as
they are pompously displayed by all geometricians
and metaphysicians, with a kind of triumph and ex∣ultation.
A real quantity, infinitely less than any
finite quantity, containing quantities, infinitely less
than itself, and so on, <HI>in infinitum;</HI> this is an edifice
so bold and prodigious, that it is too weighty for any
pretended demonstration to support, because it shocks
the clearest and most natural principles of human rea∣son<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever disputes there may be about mathematical points, we must allow that there are physical points; that is, parts of extension, which cannot be divided or lessened, either by the eye or imagination. These images, then, which are present to the fancy or senses, are absolutely invisible, and consequently must be allowed by mathematicians to be infinitely less than any real part of extension; and yet nothing appears more certain to reason, than that an infinite number of them composes an in∣finite extension. How much more an infinite number of those infinitely small parts of extension, which are still supposed in∣finitely divisible.</NOTE>. But what renders the matter more extraordi∣nary,
is, that these seemingly absurd opinions are
supported by a chain of reasoning, the clearest and
most natural; nor is it possible for us to allow the
premises without admitting the consequences. No∣thing
<PB N="238" REF="235"/>
can be more convincing and satisfactory than all
the conclusions concerning the properties of circles
and triangles; and yet, when these are once received,
how can we deny, that the angle of contact between
a circle and its tangent is infinitely less than any rec∣tilineal
angle, that as you may encrease the diameter
of the circle <HI>in infinitum,</HI> this angle of contact be∣comes
still less, even <HI>in infinitum,</HI> and that the angle
of contact between other curves and their tangents
may be infinitely less than those between any circle
and its tangent, and so on, <HI>in infinitum?</HI> The de∣monstration
of these principles seems as unexception∣able
as that which proves the three angles of a tri∣angle
to be equal to two right ones; tho' the latter
opinion be natural and easy, and the former big with
contradiction and absurdity. Reason here seems to be
thrown into a kind of amazement and suspence,
which, without the suggestions of any sceptic, gives
her a diffidence of herself, and of the ground on
which he treads. She sees a full light, which illu∣minates
certain places; but that light borders upon
the most profound darkness. And between these she
is so dazzled and confounded, that she scarce can pro∣nounce
with certainty and assurance concerning any
one object.</P>
<P>THE absurdity of these bold determinations of the
abstract sciences seems to become, if possible, still
more palpable with regard to time than extension.
<PB N="239" REF="236"/>
An infinite number of real parts of time, passing in
succession, and exhausted one after another, appears
so evident a contradiction, that no man, one should
think, whose judgment is not corrupted, instead of
being improved, by the sciences, would ever be able
to admit of it.</P>
<P>YET still reason must remain restless and unquiet,
even with regard to that scepticism, to which she is
led by these seeming absurdities and contradictions.
How any clear, distinct idea can contain circumstances,
contradictory to itself, or to any other clear, distinct
idea, is absolutely incomprehensible; and is, perhaps,
as absurd as any proposition, which can be formed. So
that nothing can be more sceptical, or more full
of doubt and hesitation, than this scepticism itself,
which arises from some of the paradoxical conclusions
of geometry or the science of quantity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities and contradictions, if it be admitted, that there is no such thing as abstract or general ideas, properly speaking; but that all ge∣neral ideas are, in reality, particular ones, attached to a general term, which recalls, upon occasion, other particular ones, that resemble, in certain circumstances, the idea, present to the mind: Thus when the term Horse, is pronounced, we immediately figure to ourselves the idea of a black or a white animal, of a particular size or figure: But as that term is also used to be ap∣plied to animals of other colours, figures and sizes, these ideas, tho' not actually present to the imagination, are easily recalled, and our reasoning and conclusion proceed in the same way, as if they were actually present. If this be admitted (as seems rea∣sonable) it follows that all the ideas of quantity, upon which mathematicians reason, are nothing but particular, and such as are suggested by the senses and imagination, and consequently, cannot be infinitely divisible. 'Tis sufficient to have dropt this hint at present, without prosecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns all lovers of science not to expose themselves to the ridi∣cule and contempt of the ignorant by their conclusions; and this seems the readiest solution of these difficulties.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="237"/>
THE sceptical objections to <HI>moral</HI> evidence, or to
the reasonings concerning matter of fact are either
<HI>popular</HI> or <HI>philosophical.</HI> The popular objections are
derived from the natural weakness of human under∣standing;
the contradictory opinions, which have been
entertained in different ages and nations; the variations
of our judgment in sickness and health, youth and
old age, prosperity and adversity; the perpetual con∣tradiction
of each particular man's opinions and sen∣timents;
with many other topics of that kind. 'Tis
needless to insist farther on this head. These objec∣tions
are but weak. For as, in common life, we rea∣son
every moment concerning fact and existence, and
cannot possibly subsist, without continually employing
this species of argument, any popular objections, de∣rived
<PB N="241" REF="238"/>
from thence, must be insufficient to destroy that
evidence. The great subverter of <HI>Pyrrhonism</HI> or the
excessive principles of scepticism, is action, and em∣ployment,
and the occupations of common life. These
principles may flourish and triumph in the schools;
where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to re∣fute
them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and
by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our
passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the
more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish
like smoak, and leave the most determined sceptic in
the same condition as other mortals.</P>
<P>THE sceptic, therefore, had better keep in his pro∣per
sphere, and display those <HI>philosophical</HI> objections,
which arise from more profound researches. Here
he seems to have ample matter of triumph; while
he justly insists, that all our evidence for any matter
of fact, which lies beyond the testimony of sense or
memory, is derived entirely from the relation of cause
and effect; that we have no other idea of this relation
than that of two objects, which have been frequently
<HI>cojoined</HI> together; that we have no arguments to
convince us, that object, which have, in our expe∣rience,
been frequently conjoined, will likewise, in
other instances, be conjoined in the same manner;
and that nothing leads us to this inserence but custom
or a certain instinct of our nature; which it is indeed
difficult to resist, but which, like other instincts, may
be fallacious and deceitful. While the sceptic insists
<PB N="242" REF="239"/>
upon these topics, he shews his force, or rather, in∣deed,
his own and our weakness; and seems, for the
time at least, to destroy all assurance and conviction.
These arguments might be displayed at greater length,
if any durable good or benefit to society could ever be
expected to result from them.</P>
<P>FOR here is the chief and most confounding objec∣tion
to <HI>excessive</HI> scepticism, that no durable good can
ever result from it; while it remains in its full force
and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic,
<HI>What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all
these curious researches?</HI> He is immediately at a loss,
and knows not what to answer. A COPERNICAN or
PTOLEMAIC, who supports each his different system
of astronomy, may hope to produce a conviction,
which will remain, constant and durable, with his
audience. A STOIC or EPICUREAN displays prin∣ciples,
which may not only be durable, but which
have a mighty effect on conduct and behaviour. But
a PYRRHONIAN cannot propose that his philosophy
will have any constant influence on the mind: Or if
it had, that its influence would be beneficial to soci∣ety.
On the contrary, he must acknowlege, if he
will acknowlege any thing, that all human life must
perish, were his principles universally and steadily to
prevail. All discourse, all action would immediate∣ly
cease; and men remain in a total lethargy, till
the necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end to
<PB N="243" REF="240"/>
their miserable existence. 'Tis true; so fatal an event
is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too
strong for principle. And tho' a PYRRHONIAN may
throw himself or others into a momentary amazement
and confusion by his profound reasonings; the first
and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his
doubts and scruples, and leave him the same, in every
point of action and speculation, with the philosophers
of every other sect, or with those who never con∣cerned
themselves in any philosophical researches.
When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first
to join in the laugh against himself, and to confess,
that all his objections are mere amusements, and can
have no other tendency than to show the whimsical
condition of mankind, who must act and reason and
believe; tho' they are not able, by their most diligent
enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the founda∣tion
of these operations, or to remove the objections,
which may be raised against them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is, indeed, a more <HI>mitigated</HI> scepticism or
<HI>academical</HI> philosophy, which may be both durable
and useful, and which may, in part, be the result of
this PYRRHONISM, or <HI>excessive</HI> scepticism, when its
undistinguished doubts are, in some measure, corrected
by common sense and reflexion. The greatest part of
<PB N="244" REF="241"/>
mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dog∣matical
in their opinions; and while they see objects
only on one side, and have no idea of any counter∣poising
arguments, they throw themselves precipi∣tately
into the principles, to which they are inclin∣ed;
nor have they any indulgence for those who en∣tertain
opposite sentiments. To hesitate or balance
perplexes their understandings, checks their passion,
and suspends their actions. They are, therefore, im∣patient
till they escape from a state, which to them is
so uneasy; and they think, that they can never re∣move
themselves far enough from it, by the violence
of their affirmations and obstinacy of their belief.
But could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible
of the strange infirmities of human understanding,
even in its most perfect state, and when most accurate
and cautious in its determinations; such a reflection
would naturally inspire them with more modesty and
reserve, and diminish their fond opinion of them∣selves,
and their prejudice against antagonists. The
illiterate may reflect on the disposition of the learned,
who, amidst all the advantages of study and reflec∣tion,
are commonly still diffident in their determina∣tions:
And if any of the learned are inclined, from
their natural temper, to haughtiness and obstinacy, a
small tincture of PYRRHONISM may abate their pride,
by showing them, that the few advantages, which they
may have attained over their fellows, are but incon∣siderable,
<PB N="245" REF="242"/>
if compared with the universal perplexity
and confusion, which is inherent in human nature.
In general, there is a degree of doubt, and caution,
and modesty, which, in all kinds of scrutiny and de∣cision,
ought for ever to accompany a just reasoner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER species of <HI>mitigated</HI> scepticism, which
may be of advantage to mankind, and which may be
the natural result of the PYRRHONIAN doubts and
scruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to such
subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of
human understanding. The <HI>imagination</HI> of man is
naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is remote
and extraordinary, and running, without controul,
into the most distant parts of space and time, in or∣der
to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered
too familiar to it. A correct <HI>judgment</HI> observes a con∣trary
method; and avoiding all distant and high en∣quiries,
confines itself to common life, and to such
subjects as fall under daily practice and experience;
leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment
of poets and orators, or to the arts of priests and po∣liticians.
To bring us to so salutary a determination,
nothing can be more serviceable, than to be once
thoroughly convinced of the force of the PYRRHONIAN
doubt, and of the impossibility that any thing but the
strong power of natural instinct, could free us from
it. Those who have a propensity to philosophy, will
still continue their researches; because they reflect,
<PB N="246" REF="243"/>
that besides the immediate pleasure, attending such
an occupation, philosophical decisions are nothing but
the reflections of common life, methodized and cor∣rected.
But they will never be tempted to go be∣yond
common life, so long as they consider the im∣perfection
of those faculties which they employ, their
narrow reach, and their inaccurate operations. While
we cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe
after a thousand experiments, that a stone will fall, or
fire burn; can we ever satisfy ourselves concerning
any determinations which we may form with regard
to the origin of worlds, and the situation of nature,
from, and to enternity?</P>
<P>THIS narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries,
is, in every respect, so reasonable, that it suffices to
make the slightest examination into the natural powers
of the human mind, and to compare them to their
objects, in order to recommend it to us. We shall
then find what are the proper subjects of science and
enquiry.</P>
<P>IT seems to me, that the only objects of the ab∣stract
sciences or of demonstration are quantity and
number, and that all attempts to extend this more
perfect species of knowlege beyond these bounds are
mere sophistry and illusion. As the component parts
of quantity and number are entirely similar, their re∣lations
become intricate and involved; and nothing
<PB N="247" REF="244"/>
can be more curious, as well as useful, than to trace,
by a variety of mediums, their equality or inequality,
thro' their different appearances. But as all other
ideas are clearly distinct and different from each other,
we can never advance farther, by all our scrutiny, than
to observe this diversity, and, by an obvious reflection,
pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there
be any difficulty in these decisions, it proceeds entirely
from the undeterminate meaning of words, which is
corrected by juster definitions. That <HI>the square of the
hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides,</HI>
cannot be known, let the terms be ever so exactly
defined, without a train of reasoning and enquiry.
But to convince us of this proposition, <HI>that where there
is no property, there can be no injustice,</HI> 'tis only neces∣sary
to define the terms, and explain injustice to be a
violation of property. This proposition is, indeed,
nothing but a more imperfect desinition. 'Tis the
same case with all those pretended syllogistical reason∣ings,
which may be found in every other branch of
learning, except the sciences of quantity and number;
and these may safely, I think, be pronounced the only
proper objects of knowlege and demonstration.</P>
<P>ALL other enquiries of men regard only matter of
fact and existence; and these are evidently incapable
of demonstration. Whatever <HI>is</HI> may <HI>not be.</HI> No ne∣gation
of a fact can involve a contradiction. The
non-existence of any being, without exception, is as
<PB N="248" REF="245"/>
clear and distinct an idea as its existence. The pro∣position,
which affirms it not to be, however false,
is no less conceivable and intelligible, than that which
affirms it to be. The case is different with the sci∣ences,
properly so called. Every proposition, which
is not true, is there confused and unintelligible. That
the cube root of 64 is equal to the half of 10, is a
false proposition, and can never be distinctly conceiv∣ed.
But that CAESAR, or the angel GABRIEL, or
any being never existed, may be a false proposition,
but still is perfectly conceivable, and implies no con∣tradiction.</P>
<P>THE existence, therefore, of any being can only
be proved by arguments from its cause or its effect;
and these arguments are founded entirely on experi∣ence.
If we reason <HI>à priori,</HI> any thing may appear
able to produce any thing. The falling of a pebble
may, for aught we know, extinguish the sun; or the
wish of a man controul the planets in their orbits.
'Tis only experience, which teaches us the nature and
bounds of cause and effect, and enables us to inser
the existence of one object from that of another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That impious maxim of the antient philosophy, <HI>Ex nihilo, nihil fit,</HI> by which the creation of matter was excluded, ceases to be a maxim, according to this philosophy. Not only the will of the supreme Being may create matter; but, for aught we know <HI>à priori,</HI> the will of any other Being might create it, or any other cause, that the most whimsical imagination can assign.</NOTE>.
<PB N="249" REF="246"/>
Such is the foundation of moral reasoning, which
forms the greatest part of human knowlege, and is
the source of all human action and behaviour.</P>
<P>MORAL reasonings are either concerning particular
or general facts. All deliberations in life regard the
former; as also all disquisitions in history, chronology,
geography, and astronomy.</P>
<P>THE sciences, which treat of general facts, are po∣lities,
natural philosophy, physic, chymistry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
where the qualities, causes, and effects of a whole
species of objects are enquired into.</P>
<P>DIVINITY or Theology, as it proves the existence
of a Deity, and the immortality of souls, is composed
partly of reasonings concerning particular, partly con∣cerning
general facts. It has a foundation in <HI>rea∣son,</HI>
so far as it is supported by experience. But its
best and most solid foundation is <HI>faith</HI> and divine
revelation.</P>
<P>MORALS and criticism are not so properly objects
of the understanding as of taste and sentiment. Beauty,
whether moral or natural, is felt, more properly than
perceived. Or if we reason concerning it, and endea∣vour
to fix its standard, we regard a new fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
the general taste of mankind, or some such fact, which
may be the object of reasoning and enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="247"/>
WHEN we run over libraries, persuaded of these
principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in
our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphy∣sics,
for instance; let us ask, <HI>Does it contain any ab∣stract
reasonings concerning quantity of number?</HI> No.
<HI>Does it contain any experimental reasonings concerning
matters of fact or existence?</HI> No. Commit it then to
the flames: For it can contain nothing but sophistry
and illusion.</P>

<HEAD>A
DISSERTATION
ON THE
PASSIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>1. SOME objects produce immediately an argree∣able
sensation, by the original structure of our
organs, and are thence denominated GOOD; as others,
from their immediate disagreeable sensation, acquire
the appellation of EVIL. Thus moderate warmth is
agreeable and good; excessive heat painful and evil.</P>
<P>SOME objects again, by being naturally conform∣able
or contrary to passion, excite an agreeable or
painful sensation; and are thence called <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil.</HI>
The punishment of an adversary, by gratifying re∣venge,
is good; the sickness of a companion, by af∣fecting
friendship, is evil.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="249"/>
2. ALL good or evil, whence-ever it arises, pro∣duces
various passions and affections, according to the
light, in which it is surveyed.</P>
<P>WHEN good is certain or very probable, it pro∣duces
JOY: When evil is in the same situation, there
arises GRIEF or SORROW.</P>
<P>WHEN either good or evil is uncertain, it gives rise
to FEAR or HOPE, according to the degrees of un∣certainty
on one side or the other.</P>
<P>DESIRE arises from good considered simply; and
AVERSION, from evil. The WILL exerts itself, when
either the presence of the good or absence of the
evil may be attained by any action of the mind or
body.</P>
<P>3. NONE of these passions seem to contain any
thing curious or remarkable except <HI>Hope</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI>
which, being derived from the probability of any
good or evil, are mixed passions, that merit our
attention.</P>
<P>PROBABILITY arises from an opposition of con∣trary
chances or causes, by which the mind is not
allowed to fix on either side; but is incessantly tossed
from one to another, and in one moment is deter∣mined
to consider an object as existent, and in ano∣ther
<PB N="253" REF="250"/>
moment as the contrary. The imagination or
understanding, call it which you please, fluctuates be∣tween
the opposite views; and tho' perhaps it may
be oftener turned to one side than the other, it
is impossible for it, by reason of the opposition of
causes or chances, to rest on either. The <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI>
of the question alternately prevail; and the mind,
surveying the objects in their opposite causes, finds
such a contrariety as utterly destroys all certainty or
established opinion.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, then, that the object, concerning which
we are doubtful, produces either desire or aversion;
it is evident, that, according as the mind turns itself
to one side or the other, it must feel a momentary im∣pression
of joy or sorrow. An object, whose existence
we desire, gives satisfaction, when we think of those
causes, which produce it; and for the same reason,
excites grief or uneasiness from the opposite conside∣ration.
So that, as the understanding, in probable
questions, is divided between the contrary points of
view, the heart must in the same manner be divided
between opposite emotions.</P>
<P>NOW, if we consider the human mind, we shall
observe, that with regard to the passions, it is not
like a wind instrument of music, which, in run∣ning
over all the notes, immediately loses the sound
when the breath ceases; but rather resembles a string-instrument,
<PB N="254" REF="251"/>
where, after each stroke, the vibrations
still retain some sound, which gradually and insensibly
decays. The imagination is extremely quick and
agile; but the passions, in comparison, are slow and
restive: For which reason, when any object is pre∣sented,
which affords a variety of views to the one
and emotions to the other; tho' the fancy may change
its views with great celerity; each stroke will not
produce a clear and distinct note of passion, but the
one passion will always be mixed and confounded with
the other. According as the probability inclines to
good or evil, the passion of grief or joy predominates
in the composition; and these passions being inter∣mingled
by means of the contrary views of the ima∣gination,
produce by the union the passions of hope
or fear.</P>
<P>4. As this theory seems to carry its own evidence
along with it, we shall be more concise in our proofs.</P>
<P>THE passions of fear and hope may arise, when the
chances are equal on both sides, and no superiority can
be discovered in one above the other. Nay, in this situ∣ation
the passions are rather the strongest, as the mind
has then the least foundation to rest upon, and is tost
with the greatest uncertainty. Throw in a superior
degree of probability to the side of grief, you im∣mediately
see that passion diffuse itself over the com∣position,
and tincture it into fear. Encrease the pro∣bability,
and by that means the grief; the fear pre∣vails
<PB N="255" REF="252"/>
still more and more, 'till at last it runs insensibly,
as the joy continually diminishes, into pure grief. After
you have brought it to this situation, diminish
the grief, by a contrary operation to that, which en∣creased
it, to wit, by diminishing the probability on
the melancholy side; and you will see the passion clear
every moment, 'till it changes insensibly into hope;
which again runs, by flow degrees, into joy, as you
increase that part of the composition, by the increase
of the probability. Are not these as plain proofs,
that the passions of fear and hope are mixtures of grief
and joy, as in optics it is a proof, that a coloured ray
of the sun, passing thro' a prism, is a composition of
two others, when as you diminish or increase the
quantity of either, you find it prevail proportionably,
more or less, in the composition?</P>
<P>5.PROBABILITY is of two kinds; either when
the object is itself uncertain, and to be determined by
chance; or when, tho' the object be already certain,
yet is it uncertain to our judgment, which finds a
number of proofs or presumptions on each side of the
question. Both these kinds of probability cause fear
and hope; which must proceed from that property,
in which they agree; to wit, the uncertainty and fluc∣tuation
which they bestow on the passion, by that con∣trariety
of views, which is common to both.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="253"/>
6. IT is a probable good or evil, which commonly
causes hope or fear; because probability, producing
an inconstant and wavering survey of an object, oc∣casions
naturally a like mixture and uncertainty of
passion. But we may observe, that, wherever, from
other causes, this mixture can be produced, the pas∣sions
of fear and hope will arise, even tho' there be
no probability.</P>
<P>AN evil, conceived as barely <HI>possible,</HI> sometimes
produces fear; especially if the evil be very great.
A man cannot think of excessive pain and torture
without trembling, if he runs the least risque of suf∣fering
them. The smallness of the probability is
compensated by the greatness of the evil.</P>
<P>BUT even <HI>impossible</HI> evils cause fear; as when we
tremble on the brink of a precipice, tho' we know
ourselves to be in perfect security, and have it in our
choice, whether we will advance a step farther. The
immediate presence of the evil influences the imagi∣nation
and produces a species of belief; but being
opposed by the reflection on our security, that belief
is immediately retracted, and causes the same kind of
passion, as when, from a contrariety of chances, con∣trary
passions are produced.</P>
<P>EVILS, which are <HI>certain,</HI> have sometimes the same
effect as the possible or impossible. A man, in a strong
<PB N="257" REF="254"/>
prison, without the least means of escape, trembles at
the thoughts of the rack, to which he is sentenced.
The evil is here fixed in itself; but the mind has not
courage to fix upon it; and this fluctuation gives rise
to a passion of a similar appearance with fear.</P>
<P>7. BUT it is not only where good or evil is uncer∣tain
as to its <HI>existence,</HI> but also as to its <HI>kind,</HI> that fear
or hope arises. If any one were told that one of his
sons is suddenly killed; the passion, occasioned by
this event, would not settle into grief, 'till he got cer∣tain
information which of his sons he had lost. Tho'
each side of the question produces here the same
passion; that passion cannot settle, but receives from
the imagination, which is unfixed, a tremulous un∣steady
motion, resembling the mixture and contention
of grief and joy.</P>
<P>8. THUS all kinds of uncertainty have a strong
connexion with fear, even tho' they do not cause any
opposition of passions, by the opposite views, which
they present to us. Should I leave a friend in any
malady, I should feel more anxiety upon his account,
than if he were present; tho' perhaps I am not only
incapable of giving him assistance, but likewise of
judging concerning the event of his sickness. There
are a thousand little circumstances of his situation and
condition, which I desire to know; and the know∣lege
of them would prevent that fluctuation and un∣certainty,
<PB N="258" REF="255"/>
so nearly allied to fear. HORACE has re∣marked
this phaenomenon.</P>
<Q><L>Ut assidens implumibus pullus avis</L>
<L>Serpentûm allapsus timet,</L>
<L>Magis relictis; non, ut adsit, auxili</L>
<L>Latura plus praesentibus.</L></Q>
<P>A VIRGIN on her bridal-night goes to bed full of
fears and apprehensions, tho' she expects nothing but
pleasure. The confusion of wishes and joys, the new∣ness
and greatness of the unknown event, so embar∣rass
the mind, that it knows not in what image or
passion to fix itself.</P>
<P>9. CONCERNING the mixture of affections, we
may remark, in general, that when contrary passions
arise from objects no way connected together, they
take place alternately. Thus when a man is afflicted
for the loss of a law-fuit, and joyful for the birth of
a son, the mind, running from the agreeable to the
calamitous object; with whatever celerity it may per∣form
this motion, can scarcely temper the one affec∣tion
with the other, and remain between them in a
state of indifference.</P>
<P>IT more easily attains that calm situation, when the
<HI>same</HI> event is of a mixed nature, and contains some∣thing
adverse and something prosperous in its different
circumstance. For in that case, both the passions,
<PB N="259" REF="256"/>
mingling with each other by means of the relation,
often become mutually destructive, and leave the mind
in perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>BUT suppose, that the object is not a compound of
good and evil, but is considered as probable or im∣probable
in any degree; in that case the contrary pas∣sions
will both of them be present at once in the
soul, and instead of ballancing and tempering each
other, will subsist together, and by their union, pro∣duce
a third impression or affection, such as hope or
fear.</P>
<P>THE influence of the relations of ideas (which we
shall afterwards explain more fully) is plainly seen in
this affair. In contrary passions, if the objects be
<HI>totally different,</HI> the passions are like two opposite li∣quors
in different bottles, which have no influence on
each other. If the objects be intimately <HI>connected,</HI> the
passions are like an <HI>alcali</HI> and an <HI>acid,</HI> which, being
mingled, destroy each other. If the relation be more
imperfect, and consists in the <HI>contradictory</HI> views of
the <HI>same</HI> object, the passions are like oil and vinegar,
which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and
incorporate.</P>
<P>THE effect of a mixture of passions, when one of
them is predominant and swallows up the other, shall
be explained afterwards.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="260" REF="257"/>
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>1. BESIDES those passions above-mentioned,
which arise from a direct pursuit of good and aversion
to evil, there are others which are of a more com∣plicated
nature, and imply more than one view or
consideration. Thus <HI>Pride</HI> is a certain satisfaction in
ourselves, on account of some accomplishment or pos∣session,
which we enjoy: <HI>Humility,</HI> on the other hand,
is a dissatisfaction with ourselves, on account of some
defect or infirmity.</P>
<P>LOVE or <HI>Friendship</HI> is a complacency in another,
on account of his accomplishments or services: <HI>Ha∣tred,</HI>
the contrary.</P>
<P>2. IN these two sets of passions, there is an obvi∣ous
distinction to be made between the <HI>object</HI> of the
passion and its <HI>cause.</HI> The object of pride and hu∣mility
is self: The cause of the passion is some ex∣cellence
in the former case; some fault, in the latter.
The object of love and hatred is some other person:
The causes, in like manner, are either excellencies
or faults.</P>
<P>WITH regard to all these passions, the causes are
what excite the emotion; the object is what the mind
directs its view to when the emotion is excited. Our
<PB N="261" REF="258"/>
merit, for instance, raises pride; and it is essential
to pride to turn our view on ourself with complacency
and satisfaction.</P>
<P>NOW as the causes of these passions are very nu∣merous
and various, tho' their object be uniform and
simple; it may be a subject of curiosity to consider,
what that circumstance is, in which all these various
causes agree; or, in other words, what is the real,
efficient cause of the passion. We shall begin with
pride and humility.</P>
<P>3. IN order to explain the causes of these passions,
we must reflect on certain properties, which tho' they
have a mighty influence on every operation, both of
the understanding and passions, are not commonly
much insisted on by philosophers. The first of these
is the <HI>association</HI> of ideas, or that principle, by which
we make an easy transition from one idea to another.
However uncertain and changeable our thoughts may
be, they are not entirely without rule and method in
their changes. They usually pass with regularity,
from one object, to what resembles it, is contiguous
to it, or produced by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, Sect. III.</NOTE>. When one idea is present
to the imagination; any other, united by these rela∣tions,
naturally follows it, and enters with more fa∣cility,
by means of that introduction.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="259"/>
THE <HI>second</HI> property, which I shall observe in the
human mind, is a like association of impressions or
emotions. All <HI>resembling</HI> impressions are connected
together; and no sooner one arises, than the rest na∣turally
follow. Grief and disappointment give rise
to anger, anger to envy, envy to malice, and malice
to grief again. In like manner, our temper, when
elevated with joy, naturally throws itself into love,
generosity, courage, pride, and other resembling af∣fections.</P>
<P>IN
the <HI>third</HI> place, it is observable of these two
kinds of association, that they very much assist and
forward each other, and that the transition is more
easily made, where they both concur in the same ob∣ject.
Thus, a man, who by any injury from another,
is very much discomposed and ruffled in his temper,
is apt to find a hundred subjects of hatred, discontent,
impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions, especi∣ally
if he can discover these subjects in or near the
person, who was the object of his first emotion. Those
principles which forward the transition of ideas, here
concur with those, which operate on the passions;
and both, uniting in one action, bestow on the mind
a double impulse.</P>
<P>UPON this occasion, I may cite a passage from an
elegant writer, who expresses himself in the following
manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ADDISON, Spectator, N<SUP>o</SUP> 412.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline">"As the fancy delights in every thing,
<PB N="263" REF="260"/>
that is great, strange, or beautiful, and is still the
more pleased the more it finds of these perfections
in the <HI>same</HI> object, so it is capable of receiving new
satisfaction by the assistance of another sense. Thus,
any continual found, as the music of birds, or a
fall of waters, awakens every moment the mind
of the beholder, and makes him more attentive to
the several beauties of the place, that lie before
him. Thus, if there arises a fragrancy of smells
or perfumes, they heighten the pleasure of the ima∣gination,
and make even the colours and verdure
of the landscape appear more agreeable; for the
ideas of both senses recommend each other, and
are pleasanter together than where they enter the
mind separately: As the different colours of a pic∣ture,
when they are well disposed, set off one ano∣ther,
and receive an additional beauty from the ad∣vantage
of the situation."</Q> In these phaenomena,
we may remark the association both of impressions
and ideas; as well as the mutual assistance these asso∣ciations
lend to each other.</P>
<P>4. IT seems to me, that both these species of rela∣tion
have place in producing <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Humility,</HI> and
are the real, efficient causes of the passion.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the first relation, that of ideas,
there can be no question. Whatever we are proud
of, must, in some manner, belong to us. It is always
<PB N="264" REF="261"/>
<HI>our</HI> knowlege, <HI>our</HI> sense, beauty, possessions, family,
on which we value ourselves. Self, which is the
<HI>object</HI> of the passion, must still be related to that qua∣lity
or circumstance, which <HI>causes</HI> the passion. There
must be a connexion between them; an easy transition
of the imagination; or a facility of the conception in
passing from one to the other. Where this connexion
is wanting, no object can either excite pride or hu∣mility;
and the more you weaken the connexion, the
more you weaken the passion.</P>
<P>5. THE only subject of enquiry is, whether there
be a like relation of impressions or sentiments, where∣ever
pride or humility is felt; whether the circum∣stance,
which causes the passion, produces antecedently
a sentiment similar to the passion; and whether there
be an easy transfusion of the one into the other.</P>
<P>THE feeling or sentiment of pride is agreeable; of
humility, painful. An agreeable sensation is, there∣fore,
related to the former; a painful, to the latter.
And if we find, after examination, that every object,
which produces pride, produces also a separate plea∣sure;
and every object, that causes humility, excites
in like manner a separate uneasiness; we must allow,
in that case, that the present theory is fully proved
and ascertained. The double relation of ideas and
sentiments will be acknowleged incontestable.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="262"/>
6. To begin with personal merit and demerit, the
most obvious causes of these passions; it would be en∣tirely
foreign to our present purpose to examine the
foundation of moral distinctions. It is sufficient to
observe, that the foregoing theory concerning the
origin of the passions may be defended on any hypo∣thesis.
The most probable system, which has been
advanced to explain the difference between vice and
virtue, is, that either from a primary constitution of
nature, or from a sense of public or private interest,
certain characters, upon the very view and contem∣plation,
produce uneasiness; and others, in like man∣ner,
excite pleasure. The uneasiness and satisfaction,
produced in the spectator, are essential to vice and
virtue. To approve of a character, is to feel a de∣light
upon its appearance. To disapprove of it, is to
be sensible of an uneasiness. The pain and pleasure
therefore, being, in a manner, the primary source of
blame or praise, must also be the causes of all their
effects; and consequently, the causes of pride and
humility, which are the unavoidable attendants of
that distinction.</P>
<P>BUT supposing this theory of morals should not
be received; it is still evident that pain and plea∣sure,
if not the sources of moral distinctions, are at
least inseparable from them. A generous and noble
character affords a satisfaction even in the survey;
and when presented to us, tho' only in a poem or
<PB N="266" REF="263"/>
fable, never fails to charm and delight us. On the
other hand, cruelty and treachery displease from their
very nature; nor is it possible ever to reconcile us to
these qualities, either in ourselves or others. Vir∣tue,
therefore, produces always a pleasure distinct
from the pride or self-satisfaction which attends it:
Vice, an uneasiness separate from the humility or re∣morse.</P>
<P>BUT
a high or low conceit of ourselves arises not
from those qualities alone of the mind, which, ac∣cording
to common systems of ethics, have been de∣fined
parts of moral duty; but from any other, which
have a connexion with pleasure or uneasiness. No∣thing
flatters our vanity more than the talent of pleas∣ing
by our wit, good-humour, or any other accom∣plishment;
and nothing gives us a more sensible mor∣tification,
than a disappointment in any attempt of
that kind. No one has ever been able to tell pre∣cisely,
what <HI>wit</HI> is, and to shew why such a system of
thought must be received under that denomination,
and such another rejected. It is by taste alone we can
decide concerning it; nor are we possest of any other
standard, by which we can form a judgment of this
nature. Now what is this <HI>taste,</HI> from which true and
false wit in a manner receive their being, and with∣out
which no thought can have a title to either of
these denominations? It is plainly nothing but a
sensation of pleasure from true wit, and of dis∣gust
<PB N="267" REF="264"/>
from false, without our being able to tell the
reasons of that satisfaction or uneasiness. The power
of exciting these opposite sensations is, therefore, the
very essence of true or false wit; and consequently,
the cause of that vanity or mortification, which arises
from one or the other.</P>
<P>7. BEAUTY of all kinds gives us a peculiar delight
and satisfaction; as deformity produces pain, upon
whatever subject it may be placed, and whether sur∣veyed
in an animate or inanimate object. If the
beauty or deformity belong to our own face, shape,
or person, this pleasure or uneasiness is converted into
pride or humility; as having in this case all the cir∣cumstances
requisite to produce a perfect transition,
according to the present theory.</P>
<P>IT would seem, that the very essence of beauty con∣sists
in its power of producing pleasure. All its ef∣fects,
therefore, must proceed from this circumstance:
And if beauty is so universally the subject of vanity,
it is only from its being the cause of pleasure.</P>
<P>CONCERNING all other bodily accomplishments,
we may observe in general, that whatever in ourselves
is either useful, beautiful, or surprizing, is an object
of pride; and the contrary, of humility. These qua∣lities
agree in producing a separate pleasure; and agree
in nothing else.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="265"/>
WE are vain of the surprizing adventures which
we have met with, the escapes which we have made,
the dangers to which we have been exposed; as well
as of our surprizing seats or vigour and activity.
Hence the origin of vulgar lying; where men, with∣out
any interest, and merely out of vanity, heap up
a number of extraordinary events, which are either the
fictions of their brain; or, if true, have no connexion
with themselves. Their fruitful invention supplies
them with a variety of adventures; and where that
talent is wanting, they appropriate such as belong to
others, in order to gratify their vanity: For between
that passion, and the sentiment of pleasure, there is
always a close connexion.</P>
<P>8. BUT tho' pride and humility have the qualities
of our mind and body, that is, of self, for their na∣tural
and more immediate causes; we find by experi∣ence,
that many other objects produce these affections.
We found vanity upon houses, gardens, equipage,
and other external objects; as well as upon personal
merit and accomplishments. This happens when ex∣ternal
objects acquire any particular relation to our∣selves,
and are associated or connected with us. A
beautiful fish in the ocean, a well-proportioned ani∣mal
in a forest, and indeed, any thing, which nei∣ther
belongs nor is related to us, has no manner of
influence on our vanity; whatever extraordinary qua∣lities
it may be endowed with, and whatever degree
<PB N="269" REF="266"/>
if surprize and admiration it may naturally occasion.
It must be someway associated with us, in order to
touch our pride. Its idea must hang, in a manner,
upon that of ourselves; and the transition from one
to the other must be easy and natural.</P>
<P>MEN are vain of the beauty either of <HI>their</HI> country,
or <HI>their</HI> country, or even of <HI>their</HI> parish. Here the
idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure. This
pleasure is related to pride. The object or cause of
this pleasure is, by the supposition, related to self, the
object of pride. By this double relation of senti∣ments
and ideas, a transition is made from one to the
other.</P>
<P>MEN are also vain of the happy temperature of the
climate, in which they are born; of the fertility of
their native soil; of the goodness of the wines, fruits,
or victuals, produced by it; of the softness or force
of their language, with other particulars of that kind.
These objects have plainly a reference to the pleasures
of the senses, and are originally considered as agree∣able
to the feeling, taste, or hearing. How could
they become causes of pride, except by means of that
transition above explained?</P>
<P>THERE are some, who discover a vanity of an op∣posite
kind, and affect to depreciate their own coun∣try,
in comparison of those, to which they have tra∣velled.
<PB N="270" REF="267"/>
These persons find, when they are at
home, and surrounded with their countrymen, that
the strong relation between them and their own nation
is shared with so many, that it is in a manner lost to
them; whereas, that distant relation to a foreign
country, which is formed by their having seen it, and
lived in it, is augmented by their considering how
few have done the same. For this reason, they al∣ways
admire the beauty, utility, and rarity of what
they met with abroad, above what they find at
home.</P>
<P>SINCE we can be vain of a country, climate, or
any inanimate object, which bears a relation to us;
it is no wonder we should be vain of the qualities of
those, who are connected with us by blood or friend∣ship.
Accordingly we find, that any qualities which,
when belonging to ourself, produce pride, produce
also, in a less degree, the same affection, when dis∣covered
in persons, related to us. The beauty, ad∣dress,
merit, credit, and honours of their kindred are
carefully displayed by the proud, and are considerable
sources of their vanity.</P>
<P>AS we are proud of riches in ourselves, we desire,
in order to gratify our vanity, that every one, who
has any connexion with us, should likewise be pos∣sest
of them, and are ashamed of such as are mean
<PB N="271" REF="268"/>
or poor among our friends and relations. Our fore∣fathers
being conceived as our nearest relations; every
one naturally affects to be of a good family, and to
be descended from a long succession of rich and ho∣nourable
ancestors.</P>
<P>THOSE, who boast of the antiquity of their fami∣lies,
are glad when they can join this circumstance,
that their ancestors, for many generations, have been
uninterrupted proprietors of the <HI>some</HI> portion of land,
and that their family has never changed its possessions,
or been transplanted into any other county or pro∣vince.
It is an additional subject of vanity, when
they can boast, that these possessions have been trans∣mitted
thro' a descent, composed entirely of males,
and that the honours and fortune have never passed
thro' any female. Let us endeavour to explain these
phaenomena from the foregoing theory.</P>
<P>WHEN any one values himself on the antiquity of
his family the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not merely the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ancestors (for in
that respect all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are alike▪ but these circum∣stances,
joined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sriches and credit of his ancef∣tors,
which are supposed to reflect a lustre on him∣self,
upon account of his connexion with them. Since
therefore the passion depends on the connexion, what∣ever
strengthens the connexion must also encrease the
passion, and whatever weakens the connexion must
<PB N="272" REF="269"/>
diminish the passion. But 'tis evident, that the same∣ness
of the possessions must strengthen the relation of
ideas, arising from blood and kindred, and convey
the fancy with greater facility from one generation to
another; from the remotest ancestors to their poste∣rity,
who are both their heirs and their descendants.
By this facility, the sentiment is transmitted more en∣tire,
and excites a greater degree of pride and vanity.</P>
<P>THE case is the same with the transmission of the
honours and fortune, thro' a succession of males, with∣out
their passing thro' any female. It is an obvious
quality of human nature, that the imagination natu∣rally
turns to whatever is important and considerable;
and where two objects are presented, a small and a
great, it usually leaves the former, and dwells entirely
on the latter. This is the reason, why children com∣monly
bear their father's name, and are esteemed to
be of a nobler or meaner birth, according to <HI>his</HI> fa∣mily.
And tho' the mother should be possest of su∣perior
qualities to the father, as often happens, the
<HI>general rule</HI> prevails, notwithstanding the exception,
according to the doctrine, which shall be explained
afterwards. Nay, even when a superiorty of any
kind is so great, or when any other reasons have
such an effect, as to make the children rather repre∣sent
the mother's family than the father's, the general
rule still retains an efficacy, sufficient to weaken the
relation, and make a kind of breach in the line of
<PB N="273" REF="270"/>
ancestors. The imagination runs not along them with
the same facility, nor is able to tranfer the honour
and credit of the ancestors to their posterity of the
same name and family so readily, as when the tran∣sition
is conformable to the general rule, and passes
thro' the male line, from father to son, or from bro∣ther
to brother.</P>
<P>9. BUT <HI>property,</HI> as it gives us the fullest power
and authority over any object, is the relation, which
has the greatest influence on these passions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That property is a species of <HI>relation,</HI> which produces a con∣nexion between the person and the object is evident: The ima∣gination passes naturally and easily from the consideration of a field to that of the person, whom it belongs to. It may only be asked, how this relation is resolveable into any of those three, viz. <HI>causation, contiguity</HI> and <HI>resemblance,</HI> which we have affirmed to be the sole connecting principles among ideas. To be the pro∣prietor of any thing is to be the sole person, who, by the laws of society, has a right to dispose of it, and to enjoy the benefit of it. This right has at least a tendency to procure the person the exercise of it; and in fact does commonly procure him that advantage. For rights which had no influence, and never took place, would be no rights at all. Now a person who disposes of an object, and reaps benefit from it, both produces, or may pro∣duce, effects on it, and is affected by it. Property therefore is a species of <HI>causation.</HI> It enables the person to produce alterations on the object, and it supposes that his condition is improved and altered by it. It is indeed the relation the most interesting of any, and occurs the most frequently to the mind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="271"/>
EVERY thing, belonging to a vain man, is the best
that is any where to be found. His houses, equipage,
furniture, cloaths, horses, hounds, excel all others in
his conceit; and it is easy to observe, that, from the
least advantage in any of these, he draws a new sub∣ject
of pride and vanity. His wine, if you will be∣lieve
him, has a finer flavour than any other; his
cookery is more exquisite; his table more orderly; his
servants more expert; the air, in which he lives, more
healthful; the soil, which he cultivates, more fertile;
his fruits ripen earlier, and to greater perfection:
Such a thing is remarkable for its novelty; such ano∣ther
for its antiquity: This is the workmanship of
a famous artist; that belonged once to such a prince
or great man. All objects, in a word, which are use∣ful,
beautiful, or surprizing, or are related to such,
may, by means of property, give rise to this passion.
These all agree in giving pleasure. This alone is
common to them; and therefore must be the quality,
that produces the passion, which is their common
effect. As every new instance is a new argument,
and as the instances are here without number; it
would seem, that this theory is sufficiently confirmed
by experience.</P>
<P>RICHES imply the power of acquiring whatever is
agreeable; and as they comprehend many particular
objects of vanity, necessarily become one of the chief
causes of that passion.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="272"/>
10. OUR opinions of all kinds are strongly affected
by society and sympathy, and it is almost impossible
for us to support any principle or sentiment, against
the universal consent of every one, with whom we
have any friendship or correspondence. But of all our
opinions, those, which we form in our own favour;
however lofty or presuming; are at bottom, the frail∣est,
and the most easily shaken by the contradiction
and opposition of others. Our great concern, in this
case, makes us soon alarmed, and keeps our passions
upon the watch: Our consciousness of partiality still
makes us dread a mistake: And the very difficulty of
judging concerning an object, which is never set at
a due distance from us, nor is seen in a proper point
of view, makes us hearken anxiously to the opinions
of others, who are better qualified to form just opi∣nions
concerning us. Hence that strong love of fame,
with which all mankind are possest. It is in order to
fix and confirm their favourable opinion of themselves,
not from any original passion, that they seek the ap∣plauses
of others. And when a man desires to be
praised, it is for the same reason, that a beauty is
pleased with surveying herself in a favourable look∣ing-glass,
and seeing the reflexion of her own
charms.</P>
<P>THO' it be difficult in all points of speculation
to distinguish a cause, which encreases an effect, from
one, which solely produces it; yet in the present case
<PB N="276" REF="273"/>
the phaenomena seem pretty strong and satisfactory
in confirmation of the foregoing principle.</P>
<P>WE receive a much greater satisfaction from the
approbation of those whom we ourselves esteem and
approve of, than of those, whom we contemn and
despise.</P>
<P>WHEN esteem is obtained after a long and inti∣mate
acquaintance, it gratifies our vanity in a pecu∣liar
manner.</P>
<P>THE suffrage of those, who are shy and backward
in giving praise, is attended with an additional relish
and enjoyment, if we can obtain it in our favour.</P>
<P>WHERE a great man is nice in his choice of favou∣rites,
every one courts with greater earnestness his
countenance and protection.</P>
<P>PRAISE never gives us much pleasure, unless it con∣cur
with our own opinion, and extol us for those
qualities, in which we chiefly excel.</P>
<P>THESE phaenomena seem to prove, that the fa∣vourable
opinions of others are regarded only as au∣thorities,
or as confirmations of our own opinion.
And if they have more influence on this subject than
in any other, it is easily accounted for from the na∣ture
of the subject.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="274"/>
11. THUS few objects, however related to us, and
whatever pleasure they produce, are able to excite a great
degree of pride or self satisfaction; unless they be also
obvious to others, and engage the approbation of the
spectators. What disposition of mind so desirable as
the peaceful, resigned, contented; which readily sub∣mits
to all the dispensations of providence, and pre∣serves
a constant serenity amidst the greatest misfor∣tunes
and disappointments? Yet this disposition, tho'
acknowleged to be a virtue or excellence, is seldom
the foundation of great vanity or self-applause; hav∣ing
no brilliancy or exterior lustre, and rather cheer∣ing
the heart, than animating the behaviour and con∣versation.
The case is the same with many other
qualities of the mind, body, or fortune; and this cir∣cumstance,
as well as the double relations above men∣tioned,
must be admitted to be of consequence in the
production of these passions.</P>
<P>A SECOND circumstance, which is of consequence
in this affair, is the constancy and duration of the ob∣ject.
What is very casual and inconstant, beyond
the common course of human affairs, gives little joy,
and less pride. We are not much satisfied with the
thing itself; and are still less apt to feel any new de∣gree
of self-satisfaction upon its account. We foresee
and anticipate its change; which makes us little sa∣tisfied
with the thing itself: We compare it to our∣selves,
whose existence is more durable; by which
<PB N="278" REF="275"/>
means its inconstancy appears still greater. It seems
ridiculous to make ourselves the object of a passion,
on account of a quality or possession, which is of so
much shorter duration, and attends us during so small
a part of our existence.</P>
<P>A THIRD circumstance, not to be neglected, is,
that the objects, in order to produce pride or self-value,
must be peculiar to us, or at least, common to
us with a few others. The advantages of sun-shine,
good weather, a happy climate, &amp;c. distinguish us not
from any of our companions, and give us no prefer∣ence
or superiority. The comparison which we are
every moment apt to make, presents no inference to
our advantage; and we still remain, notwithstanding
these enjoyments, on a level with all our friends and
acquaintance.</P>
<P>AS health and sickness vary incessantly to all men,
and there is no one, who is solely or certainly fixed
in either; these accidental blessings and calamities are
in a manner separated from us, and are not con∣sidered
as a foundation for vanity or humiliation. But
wherever a malady of any kind is so rooted in our
constitution, that we no longer entertain any hopes
of recovery, from that moment it damps our self-conceit,
as is evident in old men, whom nothing
mortifies more than the consideration of their age and
infirmities. They endeavour, as long as possible, to
<PB N="279" REF="276"/>
conceal their blindness and deafness, their rheums
and gouts; nor do they ever avow them without re∣luctance
and uneasiness. And tho' young men are
not ashamed of every head-ach or cold which they
fall into; yet no topic is more proper to mortify hu∣man
pride, and make us entertain a mean opinion of
our nature, than this, that we are every moment of
our lives subject to such infirmities. This proves,
that bodily pain and sickness are in themselves proper
causes of humility; tho' the custom of estimating
every thing, by comparison, more than by its intrinsic
worth and value, makes us overlook those calamities,
which we find incident to every one, and causes us to
form an idea of our merit and character, independent
of them.</P>
<P>WE are ashamed of such maladies as affect others,
and are either dangerous or disagreeable to them. Of
the epilepsy; because it gives a horror to every one
present: Of the itch; because it is infectious: Of the
king's evil; because it often goes to posterity. Men
always consider the sentiments of others in their judg∣ment
of themselves.</P>
<P>A FOURTH circumstance, which has an influence
on these passions, is <HI>general rules;</HI> by which we form
a notion of different ranks of men, suitable to the
power or riches of which they are possessed; and this
notion is not changed by any peculiarities of the health
<PB N="280" REF="277"/>
or temper of the persons, which may deprive them
of all enjoyment in their possessions. Custom readily
carries us beyond the just bounds in our passions, as
well as in our reasonings.</P>
<P>IT may not be amiss to observe on this occasion,
that the influence of general rules and maxims on the
passions very much contributes to facilitate the effects
of all the principles or internal mechanism, which we
here explain. For it seems evident, that, if a per∣son
full grown, and of the same nature with ourselves'
were on a sudden transported into our world, he would
be very much embarrassed with every object, and
would not readily determine what degree of love or
hatred, of pride or humility, or of any other passion
should be excited by it. The passions are often varied
by very inconsiderable principles; and these do not
always play with perfect regularity, especially on the
first trial. But as custom or practice has brought to
light all these principles, and has settled the just va∣lue
of every thing; this must certainly contribute to
the easy production of the passions, and guide us, by
means of general established rules, in the proportions,
which we ought to observe in prefering one object
to another. This remark may, perhaps, serve to ob∣viate
difficulties, that may arise concerning some
causes, which we here ascribe to particular passions,
and which may be esteemed too refined to operate
so universally and certainly, as they are found to
do.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="281" REF="278"/>
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>1. IN running over all the causes, which produce
the passion of pride or that of humility; it would
readily occur, that the same circumstance, if tansfer∣red
from ourself to another person, would render him
the object of love or hatred, esteem or contempt. The
virtue, genius, beauty, family, riches, and authority
of others beget favourable sentiments in their behalf;
and their vice, folly, deformity, poverty and mean∣ness
excite the contrary sentiments. The double re∣lation
of impressions and ideas still operates on these
passions of love and hatred; as on the former of pride
and humility. Whatever gives a separate pleasure or
pain, and is related to another person or connected
with him, makes him the object of our affection or
disgust.</P>
<P>HENCE too injury or contempt is one of the greatest
sources of hatred; services or esteem, of friendship.</P>
<P>2. SOMETIMES a relation to ourself excites affection
towards any person. But there is always here im∣plied
a realtion of sentiments, without which the other
relation would have no influence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The affection of parents to children seems founded on an original instinct. The affection towards other relations depends on the principles here explained.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="279"/>
A PERSON, who is related to us, or connected with
us, by blood, by similitude of fortune, of adventures,
profession, or country, soon becomes an agreeable com∣panion
to us; because we enter easily and familiarly
into his sentiments and conceptions: Nothing is strange
or new to us: Our imagination, passing from self,
which is ever intimately present to us, runs smoothly
along the relation or connexion, and conceives with
a full sympathy the person, who is nearly related to
self. He renders himself immediately acceptable, and
is at once on an easy sooting with us: No distance,
no reserve has place, where the person introduced is
supposed so closely connected with us.</P>
<P>RELATION has here the same influence as custom
or acquaintance, in exciting affection; and from like
causes. The ease and satisfaction, which, in both
cases, attend our intercourse or commerce, is the
source of the friendship.</P>
<P>3. The passions of love and hatred are always fol∣lowed
by, or rather conjoined with, benevolence and
anger. It is this conjunction, which chiefly distin∣guishes
these affections, from pride and humility. For
pride and humility are pure emotions in the soul, un∣attended
with any desire, and not immediately excit∣ing
us to action. But love and hatred are not com∣pleat
within themselves, nor rest in that emotion, which
they produce; but carry the mind to something far∣ther.
<PB N="283" REF="280"/>
Love is always followed by a desire of hap∣piness
to the person beloved, and an aversion to his
misery: As hatred produces a desire of the misery,
and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated.
These opposite desires seem to be originally and pri∣marily
conjoined with the passion of love and hatred.
It is a constitution of nature, of which we can give
no farther explication.</P>
<P>4. COMPASSION frequently arises, where there is
no preceding esteem or friendship; and compassion is
an uneasiness in the sufferings of another. It seems
to spring from the intimate and strong conception of
his sufferings; and our imagination proceeds by de∣grees,
from the lively idea, to the real feeling of
another's misery.</P>
<P>MALICE and envy also arise in the mind without
any preceding hatred or injury; tho' their tendency
is exactly the same with that of anger and ill will.
The comparison of ourselves with others seems the
source of envy and malice. The more unhappy ano∣ther
is, the more happy do we ourselves appear in
our own conception.</P>
<P>5. THE similar tendency of compassion to that of
benevolence, and of envy to anger, forms a very close
relation between these two sets of passions; tho' of a
different kind from that insisted on above. It is not
<PB N="284" REF="281"/>
a resemblance of feeling or sentiment, but a resem∣blance
of tendency or direction. Its effect, however,
is the same, in producing an association of passions.
Compassion is seldom or never felt without some mix∣ture
of tenderness or friendship; and envy is naturally
accompanied with anger or ill will. To desire the
happiness of another, from whatever motive, is a
good preparative to affection: and to delight in ano∣ther's
misery almost unavoidably begets aversion to∣wards
him.</P>
<P>EVEN where interest is the source of our concern,
it is commonly attended with the same consequences.
A partner is a natural object of friendship; a rival of
enmity.</P>
<P>6. POVERTY, meanness, disappointment, produce
contempt and dislike: But when these misfortunes
are very great, or are represented to us in very strong
colours, they excite compassion, and tenderness, and
friendship. How is this contradiction to be accounted
for? The poverty and meanness of another, in their
common appearance, gives us uneasiness, by a species
of imperfect sympathy; and this uneasiness produces
aversion or dislike, from the resemblance of sentiment.
But when we enter more intimately into another's
concerns, and wish for his happiness, as well as feel
his misery, friendship or good-will arises, from the
similar tendency of the inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="282"/>
7. IN respect, there is a mixture of humility,
with the esteem or affection: In contempt, a mix∣ture
of pride.</P>
<P>THE amorous passion is usually compounded of
complacency in beauty, a bodily appetite, and friend∣ship
or affection. The close relation of these senti∣ments
is very obvious, as well as their origin from
each other, by means of that relation. Were there
no other phaenomenon to reconcile us to the present
theory, this alone, methinks, were sufficient.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE present theory of the passions depends en∣tirely
on the double relations of sentiments and ideas,
and the mutual assistance, which these relations lend to
each other. It may not, therefore, be improper to
illustrate these principles by some farther instances.</P>
<P>2. THE virtues, talents, accomplishments, and pos∣sessions
of others, make us love and esteem them:
Because these objects excite a pleasant sensation, which
is related to love; and as they have also a relation or
connexion with the person, this union of ideas for∣wards
the union of sentiments, according to the fore∣going
reasoning.</P>
<P>BUT suppose, that the person, whom we love, is
also related to us, by blood, country, or friendship;
<PB N="286" REF="283"/>
it is evident, that a species of pride must also be ex∣cited
by his accomplishments and possessions; there
being the same double relation, which we have all
along insisted on. The person is related to us, or
there is an easy transition of thought from him to us;
and the sentiments, excited by his advantages and
virtues, are agreeable, and consequently related to
pride. Accordingly we find, that people are natu∣rally
vain of the good qualities or high fortune of
their friends and countrymen.</P>
<P>3. BUT it is observable, that, if we reverse the
order of the passions, the same effect does not follow.
We pass easily from love and affection to pride and
vanity; but not from the latter passions to the former,
tho' all the relations be the same. We love not those
related to us on account of our own merit; tho' they
are naturally vain on account of our merit. What is
the reason of this difference? The transition of the
imagination to ourselves, from objects related to us,
is always very easy; both on account of the relation,
which facilitates the transition, and because we there
pass from remoter objects, to those which are con∣tiguous.
But in passing from ourselves to objects, re∣lated
to us; tho' the former principle forwards the
transition of thought, yet the latter opposes it; and
consequently there is not the same easy transfusion
of passions from pride to love as from love to pride.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="284"/>
4. THE virtues, services, and fortune of one man
inspire us readily with esteem and affection for ano∣ther
related to him. The son of our friend is natu∣rally
entitled to our friendship: The kindred of a
very great man value themselves, and are valued by
others, on account of that relation. The force of
the double relation is here fully displayed.</P>
<P>5. THE following are instances of another kind,
where the operation of these principles may still be
discovered. Envy arises from a superiority in others;
but it is observable, that it is not the great dispro∣portion
between us, which excites that passion, but on
the contrary, our proximity. A great disproportion
cuts off the relation of the ideas, and either keeps
us from comparing ourselves with what is remote
from us, or diminishes the effects of the compa∣rison.</P>
<P>A POET is not apt to envy a philosopher, or a poet
of a different kind, of a different nation, or of a dif∣ferent
age. All these differences, if they do not pre∣vent,
at least weaken the comparison, and conse∣quently
the passion.</P>
<P>THIS too is the reason, why all objects appear great
or little, merely by a comparison with those of the
same species. A mountain neither magnifies nor di∣minishes
a horse in our eyes: But when a FLEMISH
and a WELSH horse are seen together, the one ap∣pears
<PB N="288" REF="285"/>
greater and the other less, than when viewed
apart.</P>
<P>FROM the same principle we may account for that
remark of historians, that any party, in a civil war,
or even factious division, always choose to call in a
foreign enemy at any hazard rather than submit to
their fellow-citizens. GUICCIARDIN applies this re∣mark
to the wars in ITALY; where the relations be∣tween
the different states are, properly speaking, no∣thing
but of name, language, and contiguity. Yet
even these relations, when joined with superiority, by
making the comparison more natural, make it like∣wise
more grievous, and cause men to search for some
other superiority, which may be attended with no
relation, and by that means, may have a less sensible
influence on the imagination. When we cannot break
the association, we feel a stronger desire to remove the
superiority. This seems to be the reason, why tra∣vellers,
tho' commonly lavish of their praises to the
CHINESE and PERSIANS, take care to depreciate
those neighbouring nations, which may stand upon a
footing of rivalship with their native country.</P>
<P>6. THE fine arts afford us parallel instances. Should
an author compose a treatise, of which one part was
serious and profound, another light and humorous;
every one would condemn so strange a mixture, and
would blame him for the neglect of all rules of art
<PB N="289" REF="286"/>
and criticism. Yet we accuse not PRIOR for joining
his <HI>Alma</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> in the same volume; though
that amiable poet has succeeded perfectly in the
gaiety of the one, as well as in the melancholy of
the other. Even suppose the reader should peruse
these two compositions without any interval, he
would feel little or no difficulty in the change of the
passions. Why? but because he considers these per∣formances
as entirely different; and by that break in
the ideas, breaks the progress of the affections, and
hinders the one from influencing or contradicting the
other.</P>
<P>AN heroic and burlesque design, united in one
picture, would be monstrous; though we place two
pictures of so opposite a character in the same cham∣ber,
and even close together, without any scruple.</P>
<P>7. IT needs be no matter of wonder, that the easy
transition of the imagination should have such an influ∣ence
on all the passions. It is this very circumstance,
which forms all the relations and connexions amongst
objects. We know no real connection between one
thing and another. We know only, that the idea of
one thing is associated with that of another, and that
the imagination makes an easy transition between
them. And as the easy transition of ideas, and that
of sentiments mutually assist each other; we might
beforehand expect, that this principle must have a
<PB N="290" REF="287"/>
mighty influence on all our internal movements and
affections. And experience sufficiently confirms the
theory.</P>
<P>FOR, not to repeat all the foregoing instances:
Suppose, that I were travelling with a companion
through a country, to which we are both utter stran∣gers;
it is evident, that, if the prospects be beautiful,
the roads agreeable, and the fields finely cultivated;
this may serve to put me in good humour, both with
myself and fellow-traveller. But as the country has
no connexion with myself or friend, it can never be
the immediate cause either of self-value or of regard
to him: And therefore, if I found not the passion on
some other object, which bears to one of us a closer
relation, my emotions are rather to be considered as
the overflowings of an elevated or humane disposition,
than as an established passion. But supposing the
agreeable prospect before us to be surveyed either
from his country-seat or from mine; this new con∣nexion
of ideas gives a new direction to the sentiment
of pleasure, proceeding from the prospect, and raises
the emotion of regard or vanity, according to the na∣ture
of the connection. There is not here, methinks,
much room for doubt or difficulty.</P>

<P>1. IT seems evident, that reason, in a strict sense,
as meaning the judgment of truth and falsehood, can
never, of itself, be any motive to the will, and can
have no influence but so far as it touches some passion
or affection. <HI>Abstract relations</HI> of ideas are the object
of curiosity, not of volition. And <HI>matters of fact,</HI>
where they are neither good nor evil, where they
neither excite desire nor aversion, are totally indiffe∣rent;
and whether known or unknown, whether
mistaken or rightly apprehended, cannot be regarded
as any motive to action.</P>
<P>2. WHAT is commonly, in a popular sense, called
reason, and is so much recommended in moral dis∣courses,
is nothing but a general and a calm passion,
which takes a comprehensive and a distant view of its
object, and actuates the will, without exciting any
sensible emotion. A man, we say, is diligent in his
profession from reason; that is, from a calm desire
of riches and a fortune. A man adheres to justice
from reason; that is, from a calm regard to public
good, or to a character with himself and others.</P>
<P>3. THE same objects, which recommend them∣selves
to reason in this sense of the word, are also the
objects of what we call passion, when they are brought
<PB N="292" REF="289"/>
near to us, and acquire some other advantages, either
of external situation, or congruity to our internal
temper; and by that means, excite a turbulent and
sensible emotion. Evil, at a great distance, is a∣voided,
we say, from reason: Evil, near at hand,
produces aversion, horror, fear, and is the object of
passion.</P>
<P>4. THE common error of metaphysicians has lain
in ascribing the direction of the will entirely to one
of these principles, and supposing the other to have
no influence. Men often act knowingly against their
interest: It is not therefore the view of the greatest
possible good which always influences them. Men
often counteract a violent passion, in prosecution of
their distant interests and designs: It is not therefore
the present uneasiness alone, which determines them.
In general, we may observe, that both these princi∣ples
operate on the will; and where they are contra∣ry,
that either of them prevails, according to the ge∣neral
character or present disposition of the person.
What we call <HI>strength of mind</HI> implies the prevalence
of the calm passions above the violent; though we
may easily observe, that there is no person so con∣stantly
possessed of this virtue, as never, on any oc∣casion,
to yield to the sollicitation of violent affec∣tions
and desires. From these variations of temper
proceeds the great difficulty of deciding concerning
<PB N="293" REF="290"/>
the future actions and resolutions of men, where
there is any contrariety of motives and passions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<P>1. WE shall here enumerate some of those circum∣stances,
which render a passion calm or violent, which
heighten or diminish any emotion.</P>
<P>IT is a property in human nature, that any emo∣tion,
which attends a passion, is easily converted into
it; though in their natures they be originally diffe∣rent
from, and even contrary to each other. It is
true, in order to cause a perfect union amongst pas∣sions,
and make one produce the other, there is al∣ways
required a double relation, according to the
theory above delivered. But when two passions are
already produced by their separate causes, and are
both present in the mind, they readily mingle and
unite; though they have but one relation, and some∣times
without any. The predominant passion swallows
up the inferior, and converts it into itself. The
spirits, when once excited, easily receive a change in
their direction; and it is natural to imagine, that this
change will come from the prevailing affection. The
connection is in many cases closer between any two
passions, than between any passion and indiffe∣rence.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="291"/>
WHEN a person is once heartily in love, the little
faults and caprices of his mistress, the jealousies and
quarrels, to which that commerce is so subject; how∣ever
unpleasant they be, and rather connected with
anger and hatred; are yet found, in many instances,
to give additional force to the prevailing passion. It
is a common artifice of politicians, when they would
affect any person very much by a matter of fact, of
which they intend to inform him, first to excite his
curiosity; delay as long as possible the satisfying it;
and by that means raise his anxiety and impatience to
the utmost, before they give him a full insight into
the business. They know, that this curiosity will pre∣cipitate
him into the passion, which they purpose to
raise, and will assist the object in its influence on the
mind. A soldier, advancing to battle, is naturally
inspired with courage and confidence, when he
thinks on his friends and fellow-soldiers; and is
struck with fear and terror, when he reflects on
the enemy. Whatever new emotion, therefore,
proceeds from the former, naturally encreases the
courage; as the same emotion proceeding from the
latter, augments the fear. Hence in martial disci∣pline,
the uniformity and lustre of habit, the regu∣larity
of figures and motions, with all the pomp and
majesty of war, encourage ourselves and our allies;
while the same objects in the enemy strike terror into
us, though agreeable and beautiful in themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="292"/>
HOPE is, in itself, an agreeable passion, and allied
to friendship and benevolence; yet is it able sometimes
to blow up anger, when that is the predominant pas∣sion.
<HI>Spes addita suscitat iras.</HI> VIRG.</P>
<P>2. SINCE passions, however independent, are na∣turally
transfused into each other, if they are both
present at the same time; it follows, that when good
or evil is placed in such a situation as to cause any par∣ticular
emotion, besides its direct passion of desire or
aversion, that latter passion must acquire new force
and violence.</P>
<P>3. THIS often happens, when any object excites
contrary passions. For it is observable, that an op∣position
of passions commonly causes a new emotion
in the spirits, and produces more disorder than the
concurrence of any two affections of equal force.
This new emotion is easily converted into the predo∣minant
passion, and in many instances, is observed to
encrease its violence, beyond the pitch, at which it
would have arrived, had it met with no opposition.
Hence we naturally desire what is forbid, and often
take a pleasure in performing actions, merely because
they are unlawful. The notion of duty, when oppo∣site
to the passions, is not always able to overcome
them; and when it fails of that influence, is apt ra∣ther
to increase and irritate them, by producing an
opposition in our motives and principles.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="293"/>
4. THE same effect follows, whether the opposi∣tion
arises from internal motives or external obstacles.
The passion commonly acquires new force in both
cases. The efforts, which the mind makes to sur∣mount
the obstacle, excite the spirits, and enliven the
passion.</P>
<P>5. UNCERTAINTY has the same effect as opposi∣tion.
The agitation of the thought, the quick turns
which it makes from one view to another, the variety
of passions which succeed each other, according to the
different views: All these produce an emotion in the
mind, and this emotion transfuses itself into the pre∣dominant
passion.</P>
<P>SECURITY, on the contrary, diminishes the pas∣sions.
The mind, when lest to itself, immediately
languishes; and in order to preserve its ardor, must
be every moment supported by a new flow of passion.
For the same reason, despair, though contrary to se∣curity,
has a like influence.</P>
<P>6. NOTHING more powerfully excites any affection
than to conceal some part of its object, by throwing
it into a kind of shade, which, at the same time,
that it shows enough to prepossess us in favour of the
object, leaves still some work for the imagination.
Besides, that obscurity is always attended with a kind
<PB N="297" REF="294"/>
of uncertainty; the effort, which the fancy makes to
compleat the idea, rouzes the spirits, and gives an
additional force to the passion.</P>
<P>7. AS despair and security, though contrary, pro∣duce
the same effects; so absence is observed to have
contrary effects, and in different circumstances, either
encreases or diminishes our affection. ROCHEFOU∣CAULT
has very well remarked, that absence destroys
weak passions, but encreases strong; as the wind ex∣tinguishes
a candle, but blows up a fire. Long ab∣sence
naturally weakens our idea, and diminishes the
passion: But where the passion is so strong and lively
as to support itself, the uneasiness, arising from ab∣sence,
encreases the passion, and gives it new force
and influence.</P>
<P>8. WHEN the soul applies itself to the performance
of any action, or the conception of any object, to
which it is not accustomed, there is a certain unpli∣ableness
in the faculties, and a difficulty of the spirits
moving in their new direction. As this difficulty
excites the spirits, it is the source of wonder, sur∣prize,
and of all the emotion, which arise from
novelty; and is in itself, very agreeable, like every
thing, which inlivens the mind to a moderate degree.
But though surprise be agreeable in itself, yet as it puts
the spirits in agitation, it not only augments our
agreeable affections, but also our painful, according
<PB N="298" REF="295"/>
to the foregoing principle. Hence every thing, that
is new, is most affecting, and gives us either more
pleasure or pain, than what, strictly speaking, should
naturally follow from it. When it often returns upon
us, the novelty wears off; the passions subside; the
hurry of the spirits is over; and we survey the object
with greater tranquillity.</P>
<P>9. THE imagination and affections have a close
union together. The vivacity of the former, gives
force to the latter. Hence the prospect of any plea∣sure,
with which we are acquainted, affects us more
than any other pleasure, which we may own superior,
but of whose nature we are <HI>wholly</HI> ignorant. Of the
one we can form a particular and determinate idea:
The other, we conceive under the general notion of
pleasure.</P>
<P>ANY satisfaction, which we lately enjoyed, and of
which the memory is fresh and recent, operates on the
will with more violence, than another of which the
traces are decayed and almost obliterated.</P>
<P>A PLEASURE, which is suitable to the way of life,
in which we are engaged, excites more our desires
and appetites than another, which is foreign to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="296"/>
NOTHING is more capable of infusing any passion
into the mind, than eloquence, by which objects are
represented in the strongest and most lively colours.
The bare opinion of another, especially when inforced
with passion, will cause an idea to have an influence
upon us, though that idea might otherwise have been
entirely neglected.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that lively passions commonly
attend a lively imagination. In this respect, as well
as others, the force of the passion depends as
much on the temper of the person, as on the nature
and situation of the object.</P>
<P>WHAT is distant, either in place or time, has not
equal influence with what is near and contiguous.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not here to have exhausted this subject.
It is sufficient for my purpose, if I have made it ap∣pear,
that in the production and conduct of the pas∣sions,
there is a certain regular mechanism, which is
susceptible of as accurate a disquisition, as the laws of
motion, optics, hydrostatics, or any part of natural
philosophy.</P>
