<HEAD>DIALOGUES
CONCERNING
NATURAL RELIGION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PAMPHILUS to HERMIPPUS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been remarked, my HERMIPPUS, that,
though the ancient philosophers conveyed most
of their instruction in the form of dialogue,
this method of composition has been little practi∣sed
in later ages, and has seldom succeeded in the
hands of those, who have attempted it. Accurate
and regular argument, indeed, such as is now ex∣pected
of philosophical enquirers, naturally throws
a man into the methodical and didactic manner;
where he can immediately, without preparation,
explain the point, at which he aims; and thence
<PB REF="3"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
proceed, without interruption, to deduce the
proofs, on which it is established. To deliver a
SYSTEM in conversation scarcely appears natu∣ral;
and while the dialogue-writer desires, by de∣parting
from the direct style of composition, to
give a freer air to his performance, and avoid the
appearance of <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Reader,</HI> he is apt to
run into a worse inconvenience, and convey the
image of <HI>Pedagogue</HI> and <HI>Pupil.</HI> Or if he carries
on the dispute in the natural spirit of good com∣pany,
by throwing in a variety of topics, and pre∣serving
a proper balance among the speakers; he
often loses so much time in preparations and transi∣tions,
that the reader will scarcely think himself
compensated, by all the graces of dialogue, for
the order, brevity, and precision, which are sa∣crificed
to them.</P>
<P>There are some subjects, however, to which
dialogue-writing is peculiarly adapted, and where
it is still preferable to the direct and simple me∣thod
of composition.</P>
<P>Any point of doctrine, which is so <HI>obvious,</HI>
that it scarcely admits of dispute, but at the same
time so <HI>important,</HI> that it cannot be too often in∣culcated,
seems to require some such method of
handling it; where the novelty of the manner may
compensate the triteness of the subject, where the
vivacity of conversation may enforce the precept,
and where the variety of lights, presented by va∣rious
personages and characters, may appear nei∣ther
tedious nor redundant.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Any question of philosophy, on the other hand,
which is so <HI>obscure</HI> and <HI>uncertain,</HI> that human
reason can reach no fixed determination with re∣gard
to it; if it should be treated at all; seems to
lead us naturally into the style of dialogue and
conversation. Reasonable men may be allowed to
differ, where no one can reasonably be positive:
Opposite sentiments, even without any decision,
afford an agreeable amusement: and if the sub∣ject
be curious and interesting, the book carries
us, in a manner, into company, and unites the
two greatest and purest pleasures of human life,
study and society.</P>
<P>Happily, these circumstances are all to be found
in the subject of NATURAL RELIGION.
What truth so obvious, so certain, as the BEING
of a God, which the most ignorant ages have ac∣knowledged,
for which the most refined geniuses
have ambitiously striven to produce new proofs
and arguments? What truth so important as this,
which is the ground of all our hopes, the surest
foundation of morality, the firmest support of so∣ciety,
and the only principle, which ought never
to be a moment absent from our thoughts and me∣ditations?
But in treating of this obvious and
important truth; what obscure questions occur,
concerning the NATURE of that divine being;
his attributes, his decrees, his plan of providence?
These have been always subjected to the disputa∣tions
of men: Concerning these, human reason
has not reached any certain determination: But
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
these are topics so interesting, that we cannot re∣strain
our restless enquiry with regard to them;
though nothing but doubt, uncertainty and con∣tradiction
have, as yet, been the result of our
most accurate researches.</P>
<P>This I had lately occasion to observe, while I
passed, as usual, part of the summer-season with
CLEANTHES, and was present at those con∣versations
of his with PHILO and DEMEA,
of which I gave you lately some imperfect ac∣count.
Your curiosity, you then told me, was
so excited, that I must of necessity enter into a
more exact detail of their reasonings, and display
those various systems, which they advanced with
regard to so delicate a subject as that of Natural
Religion. The remarkable contrast in their cha∣racters
still farther raised your expectations; while
you opposed the accurate philosophical turn of
CLEANTHES to the careless scepticism of PHILO,
or compared either of their dispositions with the
rigid inflexible orthodoxy of DEMEA. My youth
rendered me a mere auditor of their disputes; and
that curiosity natural to the early season of life,
has so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole
chain and connection of their arguments, that, I
hope, I shall not omit or confound any consider∣able
part of them in the recital.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER I joined the company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part I.</NOTE> whom I
found sitting in CLEANTHES's library,
DEMEA paid CLEANTHES some compliments,
on the great care, which he took of my educa∣tion,
and on his unwearied perseverance and con∣stancy
in all his friendships. The father of PAM∣PHILUS,
said he, was your intimate friend: The
son is your pupil, and may indeed be regarded as
your adopted son; were we to judge by the pains
which you bestow in conveying to him every use∣ful
branch of literature and science. You are no
more wanting, I am persuaded, in prudence than
in industry. I shall, therefore, communicate to
you a maxim which I have observed with regard
to my own children, that I may learn how far
it agrees with your practice. The method I fol∣low
in their education is founded on the saying of
an ancient, <Q><HI>That students of philosophy ought
first to learn Logics, then Ethics, next
Physics, last of all, the Nature of the
Gods</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chrysippus apud Plut. de repug. Stoicorum.</NOTE>.</Q> This science of Natural Theology,
according to him, being the most profound and
abstruse of any, required the maturest judge∣ment
in its students; and none but a mind, en∣riched
with all the other sciences, can safely be
entrusted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Are you so late, says PHILO, in teaching your
children the principles of religion? Is there no
danger of their neglecting or rejecting altogether
those opinions, of which they have heard so
little, during the whole course of their educa∣tion?
It is only as a science, replied DEMEA,
subjected to human reasoning and disputation,
that I postpone the study of Natural Theology.
To season their minds with early piety is my chief
care; and by continual precept and instruction,
and I hope too, by example, I imprint deeply on
their tender minds an habitual reverence for all
the principles of religion. While they pass
through every other science, I still remark the
uncertainty of each part, the eternal disputations
of men, the obscurity of all philosophy, and the
strange, ridiculous conclusions, which some of
the greatest geniuses have derived from the prin∣ciples
of mere human reason. Having thus tamed
their mind to a proper submission and self-diffi∣dence,
I have no longer any scruple of opening
to them the greatest mysteries of religion, nor
apprehend any danger from that assuming arro∣gance
of philosophy, which may lead them to re∣ject
the most established doctrines and opinions.</P>
<P>Your precaution, says PHILO, of seasoning
your childrens minds with early piety, is certain∣ly
very reasonable; and no more than is requi∣site,
in this profane and irreligious age. But
what I chiefly admire in your plan of education,
is your method of drawing advantage from the
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
very principles of philosophy and learning, which,
by inspiring pride and self-sufficiency, have com∣monly,
in all ages, been found so destructive to
the principles of religion. The vulgar, indeed,
we may remark, who are unacquainted with
science and profound enquiry, observing the end∣less
disputes of the learned, have commonly a tho∣rough
contempt for Philosophy; and rivet them∣selves
the faster, by that means, in the great
points of Theology, which have been taught them.
Those, who enter a little into study and enquiry,
finding many appearances of evidence in doctrines
the newest and most extraordinary, think nothing
too difficult for human reason; and presumptu∣ously
breaking through all sences, profane the
inmost fanctuaries of the temple. But CLEAN∣THES
will, I hope, agree with me, that, after
we have abandoned ignorance, the surest remedy,
there is still one expedient left to prevent this
profane liberty. Let DEMEA's principles be im∣proved
and cultivated: Let us become thorough∣ly
sensible of the weakness, blindness, and nar∣row
limits of human reason: Let us duly consider
its uncertainty and endless contrarieties, even in
subjects of common life and practice: Let the
errors and deceits of our very senses be set before
us; the insuperable difficulties, which attend first
principles in all systems; the contradictions, which
adhere to the very ideas of matter, cause and ef∣fect,
extension, space, time, motion; and in a
word, quantity of all kinds, the object of the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
only science, that can fairly pretend to any cer∣tainty
or evidence. When these topics are dis∣played
in their full light, as they are by some
philosophers and almost all divines; who can re∣tain
such confidence in this frail faculty of reason
as to pay any regard to its determinations in points
so sublime, so abstruse, so remote from common
life and experience? When the coherence of the
parts of a stone, or even that composition of parts,
which renders it extended; when these familiar
objects, I say, are so inexplicable, and contain
circumstances so repugnant and contradictory;
with what assurance can we decide concerning the
origin of worlds, or trace their history from e∣ternity
to eternity?</P>
<P>While PHILO pronounced these words, I could
observe a smile in the countenance both of DE∣MEA
and CLEANTHES. That of DEMEA seem∣ed
to imply an unreserved satisfaction in the doc∣trines
delivered: But in CLEANTHES's features,
I could distinguish an air of finesse; as if he per∣ceived
some raillery or artificial malice in the rea∣sonings
of PHILO.</P>
<P>You propose then, PHILO, said CLEANTHES,
to erect religious faith on philosophical scepticism;
and you think, that if certainty or evidence be
expelled from every other subject of enquiry, it
will all retire to these theological doctrines, and
there acquire a superior force and authority.
Whether your scepticism be as absolute and sin∣cere
as you pretend, we shall learn by and by,
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
when the company breaks up: We shall then see,
whether you go out at the door or the window;
and whether you really doubt, if your body has
gravity, or can be injured by its fall; according
to popular opinion, derived from our fallacious
senses and more fallacious experience. And this
consideration, DEMEA, may, I think, fairly serve
to abate our ill-will to this humorous sect of
the sceptics. If they be thoroughly in earnest,
they will not long trouble the world with their
doubts, cavils, and disputes: If they be only in
jest, they are, perhaps, bad ralliers, but can ne∣ver
be very dangerous, either to the state, to
philosophy, or to religion.</P>
<P>In reality, PHILO, continued he, it seems cer∣tain,
that though a man, in a flush of humour,
after intense reflection on the many contradictions
and imperfections of human reason, may entirely
renounce all belief and opinion; it is impossible
for him to persevere in this total scepticism, or
make it appear in his conduct for a few hours.
External objects press in upon him: Passions so∣licit
him: His philosophical melancholy dissipates;
and even the utmost violence upon his own tem∣per
will not be able, during any time, to preserve
the poor appearance of scepticism. And for what
reason impose on himself such a violence? This
is a point, in which it will be impossible for him
ever to satisfy himself, consistently with his sceptical
principles: So that upon the whole nothing could
be more ridiculous than the principles of the an∣cient
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
PYRRHONIANS; if in reality they endea∣voured,
as is pretended, to extend throughout,
the same scepticism, which they had learned from
the declamations of their schools, and which they
ought to have confined to them.</P>
<P>In this view, there appears a great resemblance
between the sects of the STOICS and PYRRHO∣NIANS,
though perpetual antagonists: and both
of them seem founded on this erroneous maxim,
That what a man can perform sometimes, and in
some dispositions, he can perform always, and in
every disposition. When the mind, by Stoical
reflections, is elevated into a sublime enthusiasm
of virtue, and strongly smit with any <HI>species</HI> of
honour or public good, the utmost bodily pain
and sufferance will not prevail over such a high
sense of duty; and 'tis possible, perhaps, by its
means, even to smile and exult in the midst of
tortures. If this sometimes may be the case in
fact and reality, much more may a philosopher,
in his school, or even in his closet, work himself
up to such an enthusiasm, and support in imagi∣nation
the acutest pain or most calamitous event,
which he can possibly conceive. But how shall
he support this enthusiasm itself? The bent of
his mind relaxes, and cannot be recalled at plea∣sure:
Avocations lead him astray: Misfortunes
attack him unawares: And the <HI>philosopher</HI>
sinks by degrees into the <HI>plebeian.</HI></P>
<P>I allow of your comparison between the STOICS
and SCEPTICS, replied PHILO. But you may
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
observe, at the same time, that though the mind
cannot, in Stoicism, support the highest flights of
philosophy, yet even when it sinks lower, it still
retains somewhat of its former disposition; and
the effects of the Stoic's reasoning will appear in
his conduct in common life, and through the
whole tenor of his actions. The ancient schools,
particularly that of ZENO, produced examples of
virtue and constancy, which seem astonishing to
present times.</P>
<Q><L>Vain Wisdom all and false Philosophy.</L>
<L>Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm</L>
<L>Pain, for a while, or anguish, and excite</L>
<L>Fallacious Hope, or arm the obdurate breast</L>
<L>With stubborn Patience, as with triple steel.</L></Q>
<P>In like manner, if a man has accustomed him∣self
to sceptical considerations on the uncertainty
and narrow limits of reason, he will not entirely
forget them when he turns his reflection on
other subjects; but in all his philosophical prin∣ciples
and reasoning, I dare not say, in his com∣mon
conduct, he will be found different from
those, who either never formed any opinions in
the case, or have entertained sentiments more fa∣vourable
to human reason.</P>
<P>To whatever length any one may push his spe∣culative
principles of scepticism, he must act, I
own, and live, and converse like other men;
and for this conduct he is not obliged to give
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
any other reason, than the absolute necessity he
lies under of so doing. If he ever carries his
speculations farther than this necessity constrains
him, and philosophises, either on natural or mo∣ral
subjects, he is allured by a certain pleasure
and satisfaction, which he finds in employing him∣self
after that manner. He considers besides,
that every one, even in common life, is constrain∣ed
to have more or less of this philosophy; that
from our earliest infancy we make continual ad∣vances
in forming more general principles of con∣duct
and reasoning; that the larger experience
we acquire, and the stronger reason we are en∣dued
with, we always render our principles the
more general and comprehensive; and that what
we call <HI>philosophy</HI> is nothing but a more regular
and methodical operation of the same kind. To
philosophise on such subjects is nothing essentially
different from reasoning on common life; and
we may only expect greater stability, if not great∣er
truth, from our philosophy, on account of its
exacter and more scrupulous method of proceed∣ing.</P>
<P>But when we look beyond human affairs and
the properties of the surrounding bodies: When
we carry our speculations into the two eternities,
before and after the present state of things; into
the creation and formation of the universe; the
existence and properties of spirits; the powers
and operations of one universal spirit, existing
without beginning and without end; omnipotent,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
omniscient, immutable, infinite, and incompre∣hensible:
We must be far removed from the
smallest tendency to scepticism not to be apprehen∣sive,
that we have here got quite beyond the
reach of our faculties. So long as we confine our
speculations to trade, or morals, or politics, or
criticism, we make appeals, every moment, to
common sense and experience, which strengthen
our philosophical conclusions, and remove (at
least, in part) the suspicion, which we so justly
entertain with regard to every reasoning, that is
very subtile and refined. But in theological rea∣sonings,
we have not this advantage; while at the
same time we are employed upon objects, which,
we must be sensible, are too large for our grasp,
and of all others, require most to be familiarised
to our apprehension. We are like foreigners in
a strange country, to whom every thing must
seem suspicious, and who are in danger every
moment of transgressing against the laws and cu∣stoms
of the people, with whom they live and
converse. We know not how far we ought to
trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in such a
subject; since, even in common life and in that
province, which is peculiarly appropriated to them,
we cannot account for them, and are entirely
guided by a kind of instinct or necessity in em∣ploying
them.</P>
<P>All sceptics pretend, that, if reason be consi∣dered
in an abstract view, it furnishes invincible
arguments against itself, and that we could ne∣ver
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
retain any conviction or assurance, on any
subject, were not the sceptical reasonings so re∣fined
and subtile, that they are not able to coun∣terpoise
the more solid and more natural argu∣ments,
derived from the senses and experience.
But it is evident, whenever our arguments lose
this advantage, and run wide of common life,
that the most refined scepticism comes to be upon
a footing with them, and is able to oppose and
counterbalance them. The one has no more
weight than the other. The mind must remain
in suspense between them; and it is that very
suspense or balance, which is the triumph of
scepticism.</P>
<P>But I observe, says CLEANTHES, with regard
to you, PHILO, and all speculative sceptics, that
your doctrine and practice are as much at variance
in the most abstruse points of theory as in the con∣duct
of common life. Where-ever evidence dis∣covers
itself, you adhere to it, notwithstanding
your pretended scepticism; and I can observe too
some of your sect to be as decisive as those, who
make greater professions of certainty and assu∣rance.
In reality, would not a man be ridicu∣lous,
who pretended to reject NEWTON's expli∣cation
of the wonderful phenomenon of the rain∣bow,
because that explication gives a minute ana∣tomy
of the rays of light; a subject, forsooth,
too refined for human comprehension? And what
would you say to one, who having nothing parti∣cular
to object to the arguments of COPERNICUS
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
and GALILAEO for the motion of the earth,
should with-hold his assent, on that general prin∣ciple,
That these subjects were too magnificent
and remote to be explained by the narrow and fal∣lacious
reason of mankind?</P>
<P>There is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant
scepticism, as you well observed, which gives the
vulgar a general prejudice against what they do
not easily understand, and makes them reject e∣very
principle, which requires elaborate reasoning
to prove and establish it. This species of scepti∣cism
is fatal to knowledge, not to religion; since
we find, that those who make greatest profession
of it, give often their assent, not only to the great
truths of Theism, and natural theology, but even
to the most absurd tenets, which a traditional su∣perstition
has recommended to them. They firm∣ly
believe in witches; though they will not be∣lieve
nor attend to the most simple proposition of
EUCLID. But the refined and philosophical scep∣tics
fall into an inconsistence of an opposite na∣ture.
They push their researches into the most
abstruse corners of science; and their assent at∣tends
them in every step, proportioned to the
evidence, which they meet with. They are e∣ven
obliged to acknowledge, that the most ab∣struse
and remote objects are those, which are
best explained by philosophy. Light is in reality
anatomized: The true system of the heavenly
bodies is discovered and ascertained. But the
nourishment of bodies by food is still an inexpli∣cable
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
mystery: The cohesion of the parts of mat∣ter
is still incomprehensible. These sceptics, there∣fore,
are obliged, in every question, to consider
each particular evidence apart, and proportion
their assent to the precise degree of evidence,
which occurs. This is their practice in all natu∣ral,
mathematical, moral, and political science.
And why not the same, I ask, in the theological
and religious? Why must conclusions of this
nature be alone rejected on the general presump∣tion
of the insufficiency of human reason, without
any particular discussion of the evidence? Is not
such an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice
and passion?</P>
<P>Our senses, you say, are fallacious, our under∣standing
erroneous, our ideas even of the most
familiar objects, extension, duration, motion,
full of absurdities and contradictions. You defy
me to solve the difficulties, or reconcile the repug∣nancies,
which you discover in them. I have not
capacity for so great an undertaking: I have not
leisure for it: I perceive it to be superfluous.
Your own conduct, in every circumstance, refutes
your principles; and shows the firmest reliance
on all the received maxims of science, morals,
prudence, and behaviour.</P>
<P>I shall never assent to so harsh an opinion as that
of a celebrated writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'art de penser.</NOTE>, who says, that the scep∣tics
are not a sect of philosophers: They are only
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
a sect of liars. I may, however, affirm, (I hope,
without offence) that they are a sect of jesters or
ralliers. But for my part, whenever I find myself
disposed to mirth and amusement, I shall certainly
chuse my entertainment of a less perplexing and
abstruse nature. A comedy, a novel, or at most
a history, seems a more natural recreation than
such metaphysical subtilties and abstractions.</P>
<P>In vain would the sceptic make a distinction be∣tween
science and common life, or between one
science and another. The arguments, employed
in all, if just, are of a similar nature, and contain
the same force and evidence. Or if there be any
difference among them, the advantage lies entire∣ly
on the side of theology and natural religion.
Many principles of mechanics are founded on very
abstruse reasoning; yet no man, who has any
pretensions to science, even no speculative sceptic,
pretends to entertain the least doubt with regard
to them. The COPERNICAN system contains
the most surprising paradox, and the most contrary
to our natural conceptions, to appearances, and
to our very senses: yet even monks and inquisi∣tors
are now constrained to withdraw their oppo∣sition
to it. And shall PHILO, a man of so libe∣ral
a genius, and extensive knowledge, entertain
any general undistinguished scruples with regard
to the religious hypothesis, which is founded on
the simplest and most obvious arguments, and,
unless it meets with artificial obstacles, has such
easy access and admission into the mind of man?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
And here we may observe, continued he, turn∣ing
himself towards DEMEA, a pretty curious cir∣cumstance
in the history of the sciences. After
the union of philosophy with the popular religion,
upon the first establishment of Christianity, no∣thing
was more usual, among all religious teach∣ers,
than declamations against reason, against the
senses, against every principle, derived merely
from human research and enquiry. All the topics
of the ancient Academics were adopted by the Fa∣thers;
and thence propagated for several ages in
every school and pulpit throughout Christendom.
The Reformers embraced the same principles of
reasoning, or rather declamation; and all pane∣gyrics
on the excellency of faith were sure to be interlarded with some severe strokes of satire a∣gainst
natural reason. A celebrated prelate too<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mons Huet.</NOTE>,
of the Romish communion, a man of the most
extensive learning, who wrote a demonstration of
Christianity, has also composed a treatise, which
contains all the cavils of the boldest and most de∣termined
PYRRHONISM. LOCKE seems to have
been the first Christian, who ventured openly to
assert, that <HI>faith</HI> was nothing but a species of
<HI>reason,</HI> that religion was only a branch of philo∣sophy,
and that a chain of arguments, similar to that which established any truth in morals, poli∣tics,
or physics, was always employed in discover∣ing
all the principles of theology, natural and re∣vealed.
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
The ill use, which BAYLE and other li∣bertines
made of the philosophical scepticism of
the fathers and first reformers, still farther propa∣gated
the judicious sentiment of Mr LOCKE: and
it is now, in a manner, avowed, by all pretenders
to reasoning and philosophy, that Atheist and
Sceptic are almost synonymous. And as is cer∣tain,
that no man is in earnest, when he professes
the latter principle; I would fain hope, that there
are as few, who seriously maintain the former.</P>
<P>Don't you remember, said PHILO, the excel∣lent
saying of Lord BACON on this head? That a
little philosophy, replied CLEANTHES, makes a
man an Atheist: a great deal converts him to re∣ligion.
That is a very judicious remark too, said
PHILO. But what I have in my eye is another
passage, where, having mentioned DAVID's fool,
who said in his heart there is no God, this great
philosopher observes, that the Atheists now-a-days
have a double share of folly: for they are not con∣tented
to say in their hearts there is no God, but
they also utter that impiety with their lips, and are
thereby guilty of multiplied indiscretion and im∣prudence.
Such people, though they were ever
so much in earnest, cannot, methinks, be very
formidable.</P>
<P>But though you should rank me in this class of
fools, I cannot forbear communicating a remark,
that occurs to me from the history of the reli∣gious
and irreligious scepticism, with which you
have entertained us. It appears to me, that there
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
are strong symptoms of priestcraft in the whole
progress of this affair. During ignorant ages,
such as those which followed the dissolution of the
ancient schools, the priests perceived, that Athe∣ism,
Deism, or heresy of any kind, could only
proceed from the presumptuous questioning of
received opinions, and from a belief, that human
reason was equal to every thing. Education had
then a mighty influence over the minds of men,
and was almost equal in force to those suggestions
of the senses and common understanding, by
which the most determined sceptic must allow
himself to be governed. But at present, when
the influence of education is much diminished,
and men, from a more open commerce of the
world, have learned to compare the popular prin∣ciples
of different nations and ages, our sagacious
divines have changed their whole system of philo∣sophy,
and talk the language of STOICS, PLA∣TONISTS,
and PERIPATETICS, not that of
PYRRHONIANS and ACADEMICS. If we distrust
human reason, we have now no other principle to
lead us into religion. Thus, sceptics in one age,
dogmatists in another; whichever system best
suits the purpose of these reverend gentlemen, in
giving them an ascendant over mankind, they are
sure to make it their favorite principle, and e∣stablished
tenet.</P>
<P>It is very natural, said CLEANTHES, for men
to embrace those principles, by which they find
they can best defend their doctrines; nor need we
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
have any recourse to priestcraft to account for so
reasonable an expedient. And surely, nothing
can afford a stronger presumption, that any set of
principles are true, and ought to be embraced,
than to observe, that they tend to the confirma∣tion
of true religion, and serve to confound the
cavils of Atheists, Libertines, and Freethinkers of
all denominations.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I must own, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA,
that nothing can more surprise me, than the light,
in which you have, all along, put this argument.
By the whole tenor of your discourse, one would
imagine that you were maintaining the Being of
a God, against the cavils of Atheists and Infidels;
and were necessitated to become a champion for
that fundamental principle of all religion. But this,
I hope, is not, by any means, a question among
us. No man; no man, at least, of common
sense, I am persuaded, ever entertained a serious
doubt with regard to a truth, so certain and self-evident.
The question is not concerning the
BEING, but the NATURE of GOD. This I
affirm, from the infirmities of human understand∣ing,
to be altogether incomprehensible and un∣known
to us. The essence of that supreme mind,
his attributes, the manner of his existence, the
very nature of his duration; these and every par∣ticular,
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
which regards so divine a Being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part II.</NOTE> are my∣sterious
to men. Finite, weak, and blind crea∣tures,
we ought to humble ourselves in his august
presence, and, conscious of our frailties, adore
in silence his infinite perfections, which eye hath
not seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man to conceive.
They are covered in a deep cloud from human
curiosity: It is profaneness to attempt penetrating
through these sacred obscurities: And next to
the impiety of denying his existence, is the teme∣rity
of prying into his nature and essence, decrees
and attributes.</P>
<P>But lest you should think, that my <HI>piety</HI> has here
got the better of my <HI>philosophy,</HI> I shall support
my opinion, if it needs any support, by a very
great authority. I might cite all the divines al∣most,
from the foundation of Christianity, who
have ever treated of this or any other theological
subject: But I shall confine myself, at present, to
one equally celebrated for piety and philosophy.
It is Father MALEBRANCHE, who, I remember,
thus expresses himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Recherche de la Verité liv. 3. chap. 9.</BIBL></NOTE>. <Q>One ought not so
much (says he) to call God a spirit, in order
to express positively what he is, as in order to
signify that he is not matter. He is a Being
infinitely perfect: Of this we cannot doubt.
But in the same manner as we ought not to i∣magine,
even supposing him corporeal, that he
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
is clothed with a human body, as the AN∣THROPOMORPHITES
asserted, under colour
that that figure was the most perfect of any;
so neither ought we to imagine, that the Spirit
of God has human ideas, or bears any resem∣blance
to our spirit; under colour that we
know nothing more perfect than a human mind.
We ought rather to believe, that as he com∣prehends
the perfections of matter without be∣ing
material........he comprehends also
the perfections of created spirits, without be∣ing
spirit, in the manner we conceive spirit:
That his true name is, <HI>He that is,</HI> or in other
words, Being without restriction, All Being,
the Being infinite and universal.</Q></P>
<P>After so great an authority, DEMEA, replied
PHILO, as that which you have produced, and
a thousand more, which you might produce, it
would appear ridiculous in me to add my senti∣ment,
or express my approbation of your doc∣trine.
But furely, where reasonable men treat
these subjects, the question can never be concern∣ing
the <HI>Being,</HI> but only the <HI>Nature</HI> of the
Deity. The sormer truth, as you well observe,
is unquestionable and self-evident. Nothing ex∣ists
without a cause; and the original cause of
this universe (whatever it be) we call GOD;
and piously ascribe to him every species of perfec∣tion.
Whoever scruples this fundamental truth,
deserves every punishment, which can be inflicted
among philosophers, to wit, the greatest ridicule,
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
contempt and disapprobation. But as all perfec∣tion
is entirely relative, we ought never to ima∣gine,
that we comprehend the attributes of this
divine Being, or to suppose, that his perfections
have any analogy or likeness to the perfections
of a human creature. Wisdom, Thought, De∣sign,
Knowledge; these we justly ascribe to him;
because these words are honourable among men,
and we have no other language or other concep∣tions,
by which we can express our adoration of
him. But let us beware, left we think, that
our ideas any wise correspond to his perfections,
or that his attributes have any resemblance to
these qualities among men. He is infinitely su∣perior
to our limited view and comprehension;
and is more the object of worship in the temple
than of disputation in the schools.</P>
<P>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, there
is no need of having recourse to that affected
scepticism, so displeasing to you, in order to come
at this determination. Our ideas reach no far∣ther
than our experience: We have no experi∣ence
of divine attributes and operations: I need
not conclude my syllogism: You can draw the
inference yourself. And it is a pleasure to me
(and I hope to you too) that just reasoning and
sound piety here concur in the same conclusion,
and both of them establish the adorably myste∣rious
and incomprehensible nature of the Supreme
Being.</P>
<P>Not to lose any time in circumlocutions, said
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
CLEANTHES, addressing himself to DEMEA,
much less in replying to the pious declamations of
PHILO; I shall briefly explain how I conceive
this matter. Look round the world: contem∣plate
the whole and every part of it: You will
find it to be nothing but one great machine,
subdivided into an infinite number of lesser ma∣chines,
which again admit of subdivisions, to a
degree beyond what human senses and faculties
can trace and explain. All these various ma∣chines,
and even their most minute parts, are
adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which
ravishes into admiration all men, who have ever
contemplated them. The curious adapting of
means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles
exactly, though it much exceeds, the produc∣tions
of human contrivance; of human design,
thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since there∣fore
the effects resemble each other, we are
led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the
causes also resemble; and that the Author of Na∣ture
is somewhat similar to the mind of man;
though possessed of much larger faculties, pro∣portioned
to the grandeur of the work, which
he has executed. By this argument <HI>a posteriori,</HI>
and by this argument alone, do we prove at once
the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to
human mind and intelligence.</P>
<P>I shall be so free, CLEANTHES, said DEMEA,
as to tell you, that from the beginning I could
not approve of your conclusion concerning the
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
similarity of the Deity to men; still less can I ap∣prove
of the mediums, by which you endeavour
to establish it. What! No demonstration of the
Being of a God! No abstract arguments! No
proofs <HI>a priori!</HI> Are these, which have hitherto
been so much insisted on by philosophers, all fallacy,
all sophism? Can we reach no farther in this subject
than experience and probability? I will not say,
that this is betraying the cause of a Deity: But
surely, by this affected candor, you give advan∣tages
to Atheists, which they never could obtain,
by the mere dint of argument and reasoning.</P>
<P>What I chiefly scruple in this subject, said
PHILO, is not so much, that all religious argu∣ments
are by CLEANTHES reduced to experience,
as that they appear not to be even the most cer∣tain
and irrefragable of that inferior kind. That
a stone will fall, that fire will burn, that the
earth has solidity, we have observed a thousand
and a thousand times; and when any new in∣stance
of this nature is presented, we draw with∣out
hesitation the accustomed inference. The
exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect as∣surance
of a similar event; and a stronger evi∣dence
is never desired nor sought after. But
where-ever you depart, in the least, from the
similarity of the cases, you diminish proportion∣ably
the evidence; and may at last bring it to a
very weak <HI>analogy,</HI> which is confessedly liable to
error and uncertainty. After having experienced
the circulation of the blood in human creatures,
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
we make no doubt, that it takes place in TITIUS
and MAEVIUS: But from its circulation in frogs
and fishes, it is only a presumption, though a
strong one, from analogy, that it takes place in
men and other animals. The analogical reason∣ing
is much weaker, when we infer the circula∣tion
of the sap in vegetables from our experience,
that the blood circulates in animals; and those,
who hastily followed that imperfect analogy, are
found, by more accurate experiments, to have
been mistaken.</P>
<P>If we see a house, CLEANTHES, we conclude,
with the greatest certainty, that it had an archi∣tect
or builder; because this is precisely that
species of effect, which we have experienced to
proceed from that species of cause. But surely
you will not affirm, that the universe bears such
a resemblance to a house, that we can with the
same certainty infer a similar cause, or that the
analogy is here entire and perfect. The dissi∣militude
is so striking, that the utmost you can
here pretend to is a guess, a conjecture, a pre∣sumption
concerning a similar cause; and how
that pretension will be received in the world, I
leave you to consider.</P>
<P>It would surely be very ill received, replied
CLEANTHES; and I should be deservedly bla∣med
and detested, did I allow, that the proofs
of a Deity amounted to no more than a guess or
conjecture. But is the whole adjustment of
means to ends in a house and in the universe
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
so slight a resemblance? The oeconomy of final
causes? The order, proportion, and arrange∣ment
of every part? Steps of a stair are plainly
contrived, that human legs may use them in
mounting; and this inference is certain and in∣fallible.
Human legs are also contrived for walk∣ing
and mounting; and this inference, I allow,
is not altogether so certain, because of the dissimi∣larity
which you remark; but does it, therefore,
deserve the name only of presumption or con∣jecture?</P>
<P>Good God! cried DEMEA, interrupting him,
where are we? Zealous defenders of religion al∣low,
that the proofs of a Deity fall short of
perfect evidence! And you, PHILO, on whose
assistance I depended, in proving the adorable
mysteriousness of the Divine Nature, do you assent
to all these extravagant opinions of CLEANTHES?
For what other name can I give them? Or why
spare my censure, when such principles are ad∣vanced,
supported by such an authority, before
so young a man as PAMPHILUS?</P>
<P>You seem not to apprehend, replied PHILO,
that I argue with CLEANTHES in his own way;
and by showing him the dangerous consequences
of his tenets, hope at last to reduce him to our
opinion. But what sticks most with you, I ob∣serve,
is the representation which CLEANTHES
has made of the argument <HI>a posteriori;</HI> and
finding, that that argument is likely to escape your
hold and vanish into air, you think it so disguised,
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
that you can scarcely believe it to be set in its
true light. Now, however much I may dissent,
in other respects, from the dangerous principles
of CLEANTHES, I must allow, that he has fair∣ly
represented that argument; and I shall endea∣vour
so to state the matter to you, that you will
entertain no farther scruples with regard to it.</P>
<P>Were a man to abstract from every thing
which he knows or has seen, he would be altoge∣ther
incapable, merely from his own ideas, to
determine what kind of scene the universe must
be, or to give the preference to one state or si∣tuation
of things above another. For as nothing
which he clearly conceives, could be esteemed
impossible or implying a contradiction, every chi∣mera
of his fancy would be upon an equal foot∣ing;
nor could he assign any just reason, why he
adheres to one idea or system, and rejects the
others, which are equally possible.</P>
<P>Again; after he opens his eyes, and contem∣plates
the world, as it really is, it would be im∣possible
for him, at first, to assign the cause of
any one event; much less, of the whole of things
or of the universe. He might set his Fancy a
rambling; and she might bring him in an infinite
variety of reports and representations. These
would all be possible; but being all equally pos∣sible,
he would never, of himself, give a satisfac∣tory
account for his preferring one of them to the
rest. Experience alone can point out to him the
true cause of any phenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Now according to this method of reasoning,
DEMEA, it follows (and is, indeed, tacitly al∣lowed
by CLEANTHES himself) that order, ar∣rangement,
or the adjustment of final causes is
not, of itself, any proof of design; but only so
far as it has been experienced to proceed from
that principle. For aught we can know <HI>a priori,</HI>
matter may contain the source or spring of order
originally, within itself, as well as mind does;
and there is no more difficulty in conceiving,
that the several elements, from an internal un∣known
cause, may fall into the most exquisite ar∣rangement,
than to conceive that their ideas, in
the great, universal mind, from a like internal,
unknown cause, fall into that arrangement. The
equal possibility of both these suppositions is al∣lowed.
But by experience we find, (according
to CLEANTHES) that there is a difference be∣tween
them. Throw several pieces of steel to∣gether,
without shape or form; they will never
arrange themselves so as to compose a watch:
Stone, and mortar, and wood, without an ar∣chitect,
never erect a house. But the ideas in
a human mind, we see, by an unknown, inex∣plicable
oeconomy, arrange themselves so as to
form the plan of a watch or house. Experience,
therefore, proves, that there is an original prin∣ciple
of order in mind, not in matter. From
similar effects we infer similar causes. The ad∣justment
of means to ends is alike in the universe,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
as in a machine of human contrivance. The
causes, therefore, must be resembling.</P>
<P>I was from the beginning scandalised, I must
own, with this resemblance, which is asserted,
between the Deity and human creatures; and
must conceive it to imply such a degradation of
the Supreme Being as no found Theist could en∣dure.
With your assistance, therefore, DEMEA,
I shall endeavour to defend what you justly call
the adorable mysteriousness of the Divine Nature,
and shall refute this reasoning of CLEANTHES;
provided he allows, that I have made a fair re∣presentation
of it.</P>
<P>When CLEANTHES had assented, PHILO, af∣ter
a short pause, proceeded in the following man∣ner.</P>
<P>That all inferences, CLEANTHES, concerning
fact, are founded on experience, and that all ex∣perimental
reasonings are founded on the suppo∣sition,
that similar causes prove similar effects,
and similar effects similar causes; I shall not, at
present, much dispute with you. But observe, I
intreat you, with what extreme caution all just
reasoners proceed in the transferring of experiments
to similar cases. Unless the cases be exactly si∣milar,
they repose no perfect confidence in ap∣plying
their past observation to any particular phe∣nomenon.
Every alteration of circumstances oc∣casions
a doubt concerning the event; and it re∣quires
new experiments to prove certainly, that
the new circumstances are of no moment or im∣portance.
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
A change in bulk, situation, arrange∣ment,
age, disposition of the air, or surround∣ing
bodies; any of these particulars may be at∣tended
with the most unexpected consequences:
And unless the objects be quite familiar to us, it
is the highest temerity to expect with assurance,
after any of these changes, an event similar to
that which before fell under our observation. The
slow and deliberate steps of philosophers, here, if
any where, are distinguished from the precipi∣tate
march of the vulgar, who, hurried on by
the smallest similitude, are incapable of all discern∣ment
or consideration.</P>
<P>But can you think, CLEANTHES, that your
usual phlegm and philosophy have been preserved
in so wide a step as you have taken, when you
compared to the universe houses, ships, furniture,
machines; and from their similarity in some
circumstances inferred a similarity in their causes?
Thought, design, intelligence, such as we disco∣ver
in men and other animals, is no more than
one of the springs and principles of the universe,
as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion,
and a hundred others, which fall under daily ob∣servation.
It is an active cause, by which some
particular parts of nature, we find, produce al∣terations
on other parts. But can a conclusion,
with any propriety, be transferred from parts to
the whole? Does not the great disproportion
bar all comparison and inference? From obser∣ving
the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
concerning the generation of a man? Would the
manner of a leaf's blowing, even though per∣fectly
known, afford us any instruction concern∣ing
the vegetation of a tree?</P>
<P>But allowing that we were to take the <HI>opera∣tions</HI>
of one part of nature upon another for the
foundation of our judgement concerning the <HI>ori∣gin</HI>
of the whole (which never can be admitted)
yet why select so minute, so weak, so bounded a
principle as the reason and design of animals is
found to be upon this planet? What peculiar
privilege has this little agitation of the brain which
we call <HI>thought,</HI> that we must thus make it the
model of the whole universe? Our partiality in
our own favour does indeed present it on all oc∣casions;
but sound philosophy ought carefully to
guard against so natural an illusion.</P>
<P>So far from admitting, continued PHILO, that
the operations of a part can afford us any just
conclusion concerning the origin of the whole, I
will not allow any one part to form a rule for an∣other
part, if the latter be very remote from the
former. Is there any reasonable ground to con∣clude,
that the inhabitants of other planets pos∣sess
thought, intelligence, reason, or any thing
similar to these faculties in men? When Nature
has so extremely diversified her manner of opera∣tion
in this small globe; can we imagine, that
she incessantly copies herself throughout so im∣mense
a universe? And if thought, as we may
well suppose, be confined merely to this narrow
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
corner, and has even there so limited a sphere of
action; with what propriety can we assign it for
the original cause of all things? The narrow
views of a peasant, who makes his domestic oe∣conomy
the rule for the government of kingdoms,
is in comparison a pardonable sophism.</P>
<P>But were we ever so much assured, that a
thought and reason, resembling the human, were
to be found throughout the whole universe, and
were its activity elsewhere vastly greater and more
commanding than it appears in this globe: yet I
cannot see, why the operations of a world, con∣stituted,
arranged, adjusted, can with any pro∣priety
be extended to a world, which is in its
embryo-state, and is advancing towards that con∣stitution
and arrangement. By observation, we
know somewhat of the oeconomy, action, and
nourishment of a finished animal; but we must
transfer with great caution that observation to the
growth of a foetus in the womb, and still more,
to the formation of an animalcule in the loins of
its male parent. Nature, we find, even from
our limited experience, possesses an infinite num∣ber
of springs and principles, which incessantly
discover themselves on every change of her posi∣tion
and situation. And what new and unknown
principles would actuate her in so new and un∣known
a situation, as that of the formation of a
universe, we cannot, without the utmost temerity,
pretend to determine.</P>
<P>A very small part of this great system, during
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
a very short time, is very imperfectly discovered
to us: and do we thence pronounce decisively
concerning the origin of the whole?</P>
<P>Admirable conclusion! Stone, wood, brick,
iron, brass, have not, at this time, in this minute
globe of earth, an order or arrangement without
human art and contrivance: therefore the universe
could not originally attain its order and arrange∣ment,
without something similar to human art.
But is a part of nature a rule for another part
very wide of the former? Is it a rule for the
whole? Is a very small part a rule for the uni∣verse?
Is nature in one situation, a certain rule
for nature in another situation, vastly different
from the former?</P>
<P>And can you blame me, CLEANTHES, if I
here imitate the prudent reserve of SIMONIDES,
who, according to the noted story, being asked
by HIERO, <HI>What God was?</HI> desired a day to
think of it, and then two days more; and after
that manner continually prolonged the term, with∣out
ever bringing in his definition or description?
Could you even blame me, if I had answered at
first, <HI>that I did not know,</HI> and was sensible that
this subject lay vastly beyond the reach of my fa∣culties?
You might cry out sceptic and rallier as
much as you pleased: but having found, in so
many other subjects, much more familiar, the
imperfections and even contradictions of human
reason, I never should expect any success from its
feeble conjectures, in a subject, so sublime, and
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
so remote from the sphere of our observation.
When two <HI>species</HI> of objects have always been
observed to be conjoined together, I can <HI>infer,</HI>
by custom, the existence of one, where-ever I
<HI>see</HI> the existence of the other: and this I call an
argument from experience. But how this argu∣ment
can have place, where the objects, as in the
present case, are single, individual, without pa∣rallel,
or specific resemblance, may be difficult to
explain. And will any man tell me with a serious
countenance, that an orderly universe must arise
from some thought and art, like the human; be∣cause
we have experience of it? To ascertain
this reasoning, it were requisite, that we had ex∣perience
of the origin of worlds; and it is not
sufficient surely, that we have seen ships and cities
arise from human art and contrivance.........</P>
<P>PHILO was proceeding in this vehement man∣ner,
somewhat between jest and earnest, as it ap∣peared
to me; when he observed some signs of
impatience in CLEANTHES, and then immediate∣ly
stopped short. What I had to suggest, said
CLEANTHES, is only that you would not abuse
terms, or make use of popular expressions to sub∣vert
philosophical reasonings. You know, that
the vulgar often distinguish reason from experience,
even where the question relates only to matter of
fact and existence; though it is found, where
that <HI>reason</HI> is properly analyzed, that it is nothing
but a species of experience. To prove by ex∣perience
the origin of the universe from mind is
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
not more contrary to common speech than to
prove the motion of the earth from the same
principle. And a caviller might raise all the same
objections to the COPERNICAN system, which
you have urged against my reasonings. Have
you other earths, might he say, which you have
seen to move? Have.</P>
<P>Yes! cried PHILO, interrupting him, we have
other earths. Is not the moon another earth,
which we see to turn round its centre? Is not
Venus another earth, where we observe the same
phenomenon? Are not the revolutions of the
sun also a confirmation, from analogy, of the
same theory? All the planets, are they not
earths, which revolve about the sun? Are not
the satellites moons, which move round Jupiter
and Saturn, and along with these primary planets,
round the sun? These analogies and resem∣blances,
with others, which I have not mention∣ed,
are the sole proofs of the COPERNICAN sy∣stem:
and to you it belongs to consider, whether
you have any analogies of the same kind to sup∣port
your theory.</P>
<P>In reality, CLEANTHES, continued he, the mo∣dern
system of astronomy is now so much recei∣ved
by all enquirers, and has become so essential
a part even of our earliest education, that we are
not commonly very scrupulous in examining the
reasons, upon which it is founded. It is now be∣come
a matter of mere curiosity to study the first
writers on that subject, who had the full force of
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
prejudice to encounter, and were obliged to turn
their arguments on every side, in order to render
them popular and convincing. But if we peruse
GALILAEO's famous Dialogues concerning the sy∣stem
of the world, we shall find, that that great
genius, one of the sublimest that ever existed,
first bent all his endeavours to prove, that there
was no foundation for the distinction commonly
made between elementary and celestial substances.
The schools, proceeding from the illusions of
sense, had carried this distinction very far; and
had established the latter substances to be ingene∣rable,
incorruptible, unalterable, impassable; and
had assigned all the opposite qualities to the for∣mer.
But GALILAEO, beginning with the moon,
proved its similarity in every particular to the
earth; its convex figure, its natural darkness
when not illuminated, its density, its distinction
into solid and liquid, the variations of its phases,
the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon,
their mutual eclipses, the inequalities of the lunar
surface, &amp;c. After many instances of this kind,
with regard to all the planets, men plainly saw,
that these bodies became proper objects of expe∣rience;
and that the similarity of their nature en∣abled
us to extend the same arguments and phe∣nomena
from one to the other.</P>
<P>In this cautious proceeding of the astronomers,
you may read your own condemnation, CLEAN∣THES;
or rather may see, that the subject in which
you are engaged exceeds all human reason and
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
enquiry. Can you pretend to show any such si∣milarity
between the fabric of a house, and the
generation of a universe? Have you ever seen
Nature in any such situation as resembles the first
arrangement of the elements? Have worlds ever
been formed under your eye? and have you had
leisure to observe the whole progress of the pheno∣menon,
from the first appearance of order to its
final consummation? If you have, then cite
your experience, and deliver your theory.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>HOW the most absurd argument, replied
CLEANTHES, in the hands of a man of ingenui∣ty
and invention, may acquire an air of probabi∣lity!
Are you not aware, PHILO, that it became
necessary for COPERNICUS and his first disciples
to prove the similarity of the terrestrial and ce∣lestial
matter; because several philosophers, blind∣ed
by old systems, and supported by some sensible
appearances, had denied this similarity? But that
it is by no means necessary, that Theists should
prove the similarity of the works of Nature to
those of Art; because this similarity is self-evident
and undeniable? The same matter, a like form:
what more is requisite to show an analogy between
their causes, and to ascertain the origin of all
things from a divine purpose and intention? Your
objections, I must freely tell you, are no better
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
than the abstruse cavils of those philosophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part III.</NOTE> who
denied motion; and ought to be refuted in the
same manner, by illustrations, examples, and in∣stances,
rather than by serious argument and phi∣losophy.</P>
<P>Suppose, therefore, that an articulate voice
were heard in the clouds, much louder and more
melodious than any which human art could ever
reach: Suppose, that this voice were extended in
the same instant over all nations, and spoke to
each nation in its own language and dialect: Sup∣pose,
that the words delivered not only contain a
just sense and meaning, but convey some instruc∣tion
altogether worthy of a benevolent being, su∣perior
to mankind: could you possibly hesitate a
moment concerning the cause of this voice? and
must you not instantly ascribe it to some design or
purpose? Yet I cannot see but all the same ob∣jections
(if they merit that appellation) which lie
against the system of Theism, may also be produ∣ced
against this inference.</P>
<P>Might you not say, that all conclusions concern∣ing
fact were founded on experience: that when
we hear an articulate voice in the dark, and
thence infer a man, it is only the resemblance of
the effects, which leads us to conclude that there
is a like resemblance in the cause: but that this
extraordinary voice, by its loudness, extent, and
flexibility to all languages, bears so little analogy
to any human voice, that we have no reason to
suppose any analogy in their causes: and conse∣quently,
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
that a rational, wise, coherent speech
proceeded, you knew not whence, from some
accidental whistling of the winds, not from any
divine reason or intelligence? You see clearly
your own objections in these cavils; and I hope
too, you see clearly, that they cannot possibly
have more force in the one case than in the other.</P>
<P>But to bring the case still nearer the present one
of the universe, I shall make two suppositions,
which imply not any absurdity or impossibility.
Suppose, that there is a natural, universal, inva∣riable
language, common to every individual of
human race, and that books are natural produc∣tions,
which perpetuate themselves in the same
manner with animals and vegetables, by descent
and propagation. Several expressions of our pas∣sions
contain a universal language: all brute ani∣mals
have a natural speech, which, however li∣mited,
is very intelligible to their own species.
And as there are infinitely fewer parts and less
contrivance in the finest composition of eloquence,
than in the coarsest organized body, the propaga∣tion
of an <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Aeneid</HI> is an easier supposi∣tion
than that of any plant or animal.</P>
<P>Suppose, therefore, that you enter into your li∣brary,
thus peopled by natural volumes, contain∣ing
the most refined reason and most exquisite
beauty: could you possibly open one of them,
and doubt, that its original cause bore the strong∣est
analogy to mind and intelligence? When it
reasons and discourses; when it expostulates, ar∣gues,
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
and enforces its views and topics; when it
applies sometimes to the pure intellect, sometimes
to the affections; when it collects, disposes, and
adorns every consideration suited to the subject:
could you persist in asserting, that all this, at the
bottom, had really no meaning, and that the first
formation of this volume in the loins of its origi∣nal
parent proceeded not from thought and de∣sign?
Your obstinacy, I know, reaches not that
degree of firmness: even your sceptical play and
wantonness would be abashed at so glaring an ab∣surdity.</P>
<P>But if there be any difference, PHILO, between
this supposed case and the real one of the universe,
it is all to the advantage of the latter. The ana∣tomy
of an animal affords many stronger instances
of design than the perusal of LIVY or TACI∣TUS:
and any objection which you start in the
former case, by carrying me back to so unusual
and extraordinary a scene as the first formation
of worlds, the same objection has place on the
supposition of our vegetating library. Chuse,
then, your party, PHILO, without ambiguity or
evasion: assert either that a rational volume is no
proof of a rational cause, or admit of a similar
cause to all the works of nature.</P>
<P>Let me here observe too, continued CLEAN∣THES,
that this religious argument, instead of
being weakened by that scepticism, so much af∣fected
by you, rather acquires force from it,
and becomes more firm and undisputed. To
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
exclude all argument or reasoning of every kind
is either affectation or madness. The declared
profession of every reasonable sceptic is only to
reject abstruse, remote and refined arguments;
to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts
of nature; and to assent, where-ever any reasons
strike him with so full a force, that he cannot,
without the greatest violence, prevent it. Now
the arguments for Natural Religion are plainly
of this kind; and nothing but the most perverse,
obstinate metaphysics can reject them. Consider,
anatomize the eye: Survey its structure and con∣trivance;
and tell me, from your own feeling,
if the idea of a contriver does not immediately
flow in upon you with a force like that of sensa∣tion.
The most obvious conclusion surely is in
favour of design; and it requires time, reflection
and study to summon up those frivolous, though
abstruse objections, which can support Infide∣lity.
Who can behold the male and female of
each species, the correspondence of their parts
and instincts, their passions and whole course of
life before and after generation, but must be sen∣sible,
that the propagation of the species is in∣tended
by Nature? Millions and millions of such
instances present themselves through every part of
the universe; and no language can convey a
more intelligible, irresistible meaning, than the
curious adjustment of final causes. To what de∣gree,
therefore, of blind dogmatism must one
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
have attained, to reject such natural and such
convincing arguments?</P>
<P>Some beauties in writing we may meet with,
which seem contrary to rules, and which gain
the affections, and animate the imagination, in
opposition to all the precepts of criticism, and to
the authority of the established masters of art.
And if the argument for Theism be, as you pre∣tend,
contradictory to the principles of logic;
its universal, its irresistible influence proves clear∣ly,
that there may be arguments of a like irre∣gular
nature. Whatever cavils may be urged;
an orderly world, as well as a coherent, articu∣late
speech, will still be received as an incontest∣able
proof of design and intention.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens, I own, that the religious
arguments have not their due influence on an ig∣norant
savage and barbarian; not because they
are obscure and difficult, but because he never
asks himself any question with regard to them.
Whence arises the curious structure of an ani∣mal?
From the copulation of its parents. And
these whence? From <HI>their</HI> parents? A few re∣moves
set the objects at such a distance, that to
him they are lost in darkness and confusion; nor
is he actuated by any curiosity to trace them
farther. But this is neither dogmatism nor scep∣ticism,
but stupidity; a state of mind very differ∣ent
from your sifting, inquisitive disposition, my
ingenious friend. You can trace causes from ef∣fects:
You can compare the most distant and
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
remote objects: and your greatest errors proceed
not from barrenness of thought and invention,
but from too luxuriant a fertility, which suppresses
your natural good sense, by a profusion of un∣necessary
scruples and objections.</P>
<P>Here I could observe, HERMIPPUS, that PHILO
was a little embarrassed and confounded: But
while he hesitated in delivering an answer, luckily
for him, DEMEA broke in upon the discourse,
and saved his countenance.</P>
<P>Your instance, CLEANTHES, said he, drawn
from books and language, being familiar, has,
I confess, so much more force on that account;
but is there not some danger too in this very
circumstance; and may it not render us presump∣tuous,
by making us imagine we comprehend
the Deity, and have some adequate idea of his
nature and attributes? When I read a volume,
I enter into the mind and intention of the au∣thor:
I become him, in a manner, for the in∣stant;
and have an immediate feeling and con∣ception
of those ideas, which revolved in his i∣magination,
while employed in that composition.
But so near an approach we never surely can
make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways.
His attributes are perfect, but incomprehensible.
And this volume of Nature contains a great and
inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible
discourse or reasoning.</P>
<P>The ancient PLATONISTS, you know, were
the most religious and devout of all the Pagan
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
philosophers: yet many of them, particularly
PLOTINUS us, expressly declare, that intellect or
understanding is not to be ascribed to the Deity,
and that our most perfect worship of him consists,
not in acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude
or love; but in a certain mysterious self-anni∣hilation
or total extinction of all our faculties.
These ideas are, perhaps, too far stretched; but
still it must be acknowledged, that, by represent∣ing
the Deity as so intelligible, and comprehen∣sible,
and so similar to a human mind, we are
guilty of the grossest and most narrow partiality,
and make ourselves the model of the whole uni∣verse.</P>
<P>All the <HI>sentiments</HI> of the human mind, grati∣tude,
resentment, love, friendship, approbation,
blame, pity, emulation, envy, have a plain re∣ference
to the state and situation of man, and
are calculated for preserving the existence, and
promoting the activity of such a being in such
circumstances. It seems therefore unreasonable
to transfer such sentiments to a supreme existence,
or to suppose him actuated by them; and the
phenomena, besides, of the universe will not sup∣port
us in such a theory. All our <HI>ideas,</HI> derived
from the senses are confessedly false and illusive;
and cannot, therefore, be supposed to have place
in a supreme intelligence: And as the ideas of
internal sentiment, added to those of the exter∣nal
senses, compose the whole furniture of hu∣man
understanding, we may conclude, that none
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
of the <HI>materials</HI> of thought are in any re∣spect
similar in the human and in the divine
intelligence. Now as to the <HI>manner</HI> of think∣ing;
how can we make any comparison between
them, or suppose them any wise resembling?
Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting,
successive, and compounded; and were we to re∣move
these circumstances, we absolutely annihi∣late
its essence, and it would, in such a case, be
an abuse of terms to apply to it the name of
thought or reason. At least, if it appear more
pious and respectful (as it really is) still to retain
these terms, when we mention the Supreme Be∣ing,
we ought to acknowledge, that their mean∣ing,
in that case, is totally incomprehensible;
and that the infirmities of our nature do not per∣mit
us to reach any ideas, which in the least cor∣respond
to the ineffable sublimity of the divine
attributes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART IV.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems strange to me, said CLEANTHES,
that you, DEMEA, who are so sincere in the
cause of religion, should still maintain the myste∣rious,
incomprehensible nature of the Deity, and
should insist so strenuously, that he has no man∣ner
of likeness or resemblance to human crea∣tures.
The Deity, I can readily allow, possesses
many powers and attributes, of which we can
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
have no comprehension:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part IV.</NOTE> But if our ideas, so far
as they go, be not just, and adequate, and cor∣respondent
to his real nature, I know not what
there is in this subject worth insisting on. Is
the name, without any meaning, of such mighty
importance? Or how do you MYSTICS, who
maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of the
Deity, differ from Sceptics or Atheists, who as∣sert,
that the first cause of all is unknown and
unintelligible? Their temerity must be very
great, if, after rejecting the production by a
mind; I mean, a mind, resembling the human
(for I know of no other) they pretend to assign,
with certainty, any other specific, intelligible
cause: And their conscience must be very scru∣pulous
indeed, if they refuse to call the universal,
unknown cause a God or Deity; and to bestow
on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning
epithets, as you shall please to require of them.</P>
<P>Who could imagine, replied DEMEA, that
CLEANTHES, the calm, philosophical CLEAN∣THES,
would attempt to refute his antagonists,
by affixing a nick-name to them; and like the
common bigots and inquisitors of the age, have
recourse to invective and declamation, instead of
reasoning? Or does he not perceive, that these
topics are easily retorted, and that ANTHRO∣POMORPHITE
is an appellation as invidious,
and implies as dangerous consequences, as the
epithet of MYSTIC, with which he has honoured
us? In reality, CLEANTHES, consider what it
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
is you assert, when you represent the Deity as
similar to a human mind and understanding.
What is the soul of man? A composition of va∣rious
faculties, passions, sentiments, ideas; uni∣ted,
indeed, into one self or person, but still dis∣tinct
from each other. When it reasons, the
ideas, which are the parts of its discourse, ar∣range
themselves in a certain form or order; which
is not preserved entire for a moment, but imme∣diately
gives place to another arrangement. New
opinions, new passions, new affections, new feel∣ings
arise, which continually diversify the mental
scene, and produce in it the greatest variety, and
most rapid succession imaginable. How is this
compatible, with that perfect immutability and
simplicity, which all true Theists ascribe to the
Deity? By the same act, say they, he sees past,
present, and future: His love and his hatred, his
mercy and his justice, are one individual opera∣tion:
He is entire in every point of space; and
complete in every instant of duration. No succes∣sion,
no change, no acquisition, no diminution.
What he is implies not in it any shadow of dis∣tinction
or diversity. And what he is, this mo∣ment,
he ever has been, and ever will be, with∣out
any new judgement, sentiment, or operation.
He stands fixed in one simple, perfect state; nor
can you ever say, with any propriety, that this act
of his is different from that other, or that this judge∣ment
or idea has been lately formed, and will give
place, by succession, to any different judgement or
idea.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52"/>
I can readily allow, said CLEANTHES, that
those who maintain the perfect simplicity of the
Supreme Being, to the extent in which you have
explained it, are complete MYSTICS, and charge∣able
with all the consequences which I have drawn
from their opinion. They are, in a word, A∣THEISTS,
without knowing it. For though it be
allowed, that the Deity possesses attributes, of
which we have no comprehension; yet ought we
never to ascribe to him any attributes, which are
absolutely incompatible with that intelligent na∣ture,
essential to him. A mind, whose acts and
sentiments and ideas are not distinct and succes∣sive;
one, that is wholly simple, and totally im∣mutable;
is a mind, which has no thought, no
reason, no will, no sentiment, no love, no ha∣tred;
or in a word, is no mind at all. It is an
abuse of terms to give it that appellation; and
we may as well speak of limited extension with∣out
figure, or of number without composition.</P>
<P>Pray consider, said PHILO, whom you are at
present inveighing against. You are honouring
with the appellation of <HI>Atheist</HI> all the sound, or∣thodox
divines almost, who have treated of this
subject; and you will, at last be, yourself, found,
according to your reckoning, the only sound
Theist in the world. But if idolaters be Atheists,
as, I think, may justly be asserted, and Christian
Theologians the same; what becomes of the ar∣gument,
so much celebrated, derived from the
universal consent of mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
But because I know you are not much swayed
by names and authorities, I shall endeavour to
show you, a little more distinctly, the inconve∣niencies
of that Anthropomorphism, which you
have embraced; and shall prove, that there is
no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be
formed in the divine mind, consisting of distinct
ideas, differently arranged; in the same manner
as an architect forms in his head the plan of a
house which he intends to execute.</P>
<P>It is not easy, I own, to see, what is gained
by this supposition, whether we judge of the
matter by <HI>Reason</HI> or by <HI>Experience.</HI> We are
still obliged to mount higher, in order to find
the cause of this cause, which you had assigned
as satisfactory and conclusive.</P>
<P>If Reason (I mean abstract reason, derived from
enquiries <HI>a priori</HI>) be not alike mute with regard
to all questions concerning cause and effect; this
sentence at least it will venture to pronounce,
That a mental world, or universe of ideas, requires
a cause as much, as does a material world, or u∣niverse
of objects; and if similar in its arrange∣ment
must require a similar cause. For what is
there in this subject, which should occasion a
different conclusion or inference? In an abstract
view, they are entirely alike; and no difficulty
attends the one supposition, which is not com∣mon
to both of them.</P>
<P>Again, when we will needs force <HI>Experience</HI> to
pronounce some sentence, even on these subjects,
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
which lie beyond her sphere; neither can she
perceive any material difference in this particular,
between these two kinds of worlds, but finds
them to be governed by similar principles, and
to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their
operations. We have specimens in miniature of
both of them. Our own mind resembles the one:
A vegetable or animal body the other. Let Ex∣perience,
therefore, judge from these samples.
Nothing seems more delicate with regard to its
causes than thought; and as these causes never
operate in two persons after the same manner,
so we never find two persons, who think ex∣actly
alike. Nor indeed does the same person
think exactly alike at any two different periods of
time. A difference of age, of the disposition of
his body, of weather, of food, of company, of
books, of passions; any of these particulars, or
others more minute, are sufficient to alter the
curious machinery of thought, and communicate
to it very different movements and operations.
As far as we can judge, vegetables and animal
bodies are not more delicate in their motions,
nor depend upon a greater variety or more curi∣ous
adjustment of springs and principles.</P>
<P>How therefore shall we satisfy ourselves con∣cerning
the cause of that Being, whom you sup∣pose
the Author of Nature, or, according to
your system of Anthropomorphism, the ideal
world, into which you trace the material? Have
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
we not the same reason to trace that ideal world
into another ideal world, or new intelligent prin∣ciple?
But if we stop, and go no farther; why
go so far? Why not stop at the material world?
How can we satisfy ourselves without going on
<HI>in infinitum?</HI> And after all, what satisfaction is
there in that infinite progression? Let us remem∣ber
the story of the INDIAN philosopher and his
elephant. It was never more applicable than to
the present subject. If the material world rests up∣on
a similar ideal world, this ideal world must rest
upon some other; and so on, without end. It
were better, therefore, never to look beyond the
present material world. By supposing it to con∣tain
the principle of its order within itself, we
really assert it to be God; and the sooner we
arrive at that divine Being so much the better.
When you go one step beyond the mundane sy∣stem,
you only excite an inquisitive humour,
which it is impossible ever to satisfy.</P>
<P>To say, that the different ideas, which com∣pose
the reason of the Supreme Being, fall into
order, of themselves, and by their own nature,
is really to talk without any precise meaning.
If it has a meaning, I would fain know, why it
is not as good sense to say, that the parts of the
material world fall into order, of themselves, and
by their own nature. Can the one opinion be
intelligible, while the other is not so?</P>
<P>We have, indeed, experience of ideas, which
fall into order, of themselves, and without any
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
<HI>known</HI> cause: But, I am sure, we have a much
larger experience of matter, which does the
same; as in all instances of generation and ve∣getation,
where the accurate analysis of the cause
exceeds all human comprehension. We have
also experience of particular systems of thought
and of matter, which have no order; of the first,
in madness; of the second, in corruption. Why
then should we think, that order is more essen∣tial
to one than the other? And if it requires a
cause in both, what do we gain by your system,
in tracing the universe of objects into a similar
universe of ideas? The first step, which we make,
leads us on for ever. It were, therefore, wise
in us, to limit all our enquiries to the present
world, without looking farther. No satisfaction
can ever be attained by these speculations, which
so far exceed the narrow bounds of human un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>It was usual with the PERIPATETICS, you
know, CLEANTHES, when the cause of any
phenomenon was demanded, to have recourse
to their <HI>faculties</HI> or <HI>occult qualities,</HI> and to
say, for instance, that bread nourished by its nu∣tritive
faculty, and senna purged by its purga∣tive:
But it has been discovered, that this sub∣terfuge
was nothing but the disguise of ignorance;
and that these philosophers, though less ingenu∣ous,
really said the same thing with the sceptics
or the vulgar, who fairly confessed, that they
knew not the cause of these phenomena. In like
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
manner, when it is asked, what cause produces
order in the ideas of the Supreme Being, can
any other reason be assigned by you, Anthro∣pomorphites,
than that it is a <HI>rational</HI> faculty,
and that such is the nature of the Deity? But
why a similar answer will not be equally satisfac∣tory
in accounting for the order of the world,
without having recourse to any such intelligent
creator, as you insist on, may be difficult to de∣termine.
It is only to say, that <HI>such</HI> is the na∣ture
of material objects, and that they are all o∣riginally
possessed of a <HI>faculty</HI> of order and pro∣portion.
These are only more learned and ela∣borate
ways of confessing our ignorance; nor
has the one hypothesis any real advantage above
the other, except in its greater conformity to
vulgar prejudices.</P>
<P>You have displayed this argument with great
emphasis, replied CLEANTHES: You seem not
sensible, how easy it is to answer it. Even
in common life, if I assign a cause for any event;
is it any objection, PHILO, that I cannot assign
the cause of that cause, and answer every new
question, which may incessantly be started? And
what philosophers could possibly submit to so ri∣gid
a rule? philosophers, who confess ultimate
causes to be totally unknown, and are sensible,
that the most refined principles, into which they
trace the phenomena, are still to them as inex∣plicable
as these phenomena themselves are to the
vulgar. The order and arrangement of nature,
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
the curious adjustment of final causes, the plain
use and intention of every part and organ; all
these bespeak in the clearest language an intel∣ligent
cause or author. The heavens and the
earth join in the same testimony: The whole
chorus of Nature raises one hymn to the praises
of its creator: You alone, or almost alone, dis∣turb
this general harmony. You start abstruse
doubts, cavils, and objections: You ask me,
what is the cause of this cause? I know not;
I care not; that concerns not me. I have found
a Deity; and here I stop my enquiry. Let those
go farther, who are wiser or more enterprising.</P>
<P>I pretend to be neither, replied PHILO: and
for that very reason, I should never perhaps have
attempted to go so far; especially when I am sen∣sible,
that I must at last be contented to sit down
with the same answer, which, without farther
trouble, might have satisfied me from the begin∣ning.
If I am still to remain in utter ignorance
of causes, and can absolutely give an explication
of nothing, I shall never esteem it any advantage
to shove off for a moment a difficulty, which, you
acknowledge, must immediately, in its full force,
recur upon me. Naturalists indeed very justly
explain particular effects by more general causes;
though these general causes themselves should re∣main
in the end totally inexplicable: but they
never surely thought it satisfactory to explain a
particular effect by a particular cause, which was
no more to be accounted for than the effect itself.
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
An ideal system, arranged of itself, without a
precedent design, is not a whit more explicable
than a material one, which attains its order in a
like manner; nor is there any more difficulty in
the latter supposition than in the former.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART V.</HEAD>
<P>BUT to show you still more inconveniencies,
continued PHILO, in your Anthropomorphism;
please to take a new survey of your principles.
<HI>Like effects prove like causes</HI> This is the ex∣perimental
argument; and this, you say too, is
the sole theological argument. Now it is certain,
that the liker the effects are, which are seen, and
the liker the causes, which are inferred, the
stronger is the argument. Every departure on ei∣ther
side diminishes the probability, and renders
the experiment less conclusive. You cannot
doubt of the principle: neither ought you to re∣ject
its consequences.</P>
<P>All the new discoveries in astronomy, which
prove the immense grandeur and magnificence of
the works of Nature, are so many additional ar∣guments
for a Deity, according to the true sy∣stem
of Theism: but according to your hypothe∣sis
of experimental Theism, they become so
many objections, by removing the effect still far∣ther
from all resemblance to the effects of human

<P>If <HI>Tully</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De nat. Deor. lib. 1.</NOTE>
esteemed this reasoning so natural as
to put it into the mouth of his EPICUREAN.
<HI>Quibus euim oculis animi intueri potuit vester

quae ferramenta? qui vectes? quae ma∣chinae?
qui ministri tanti muneris fuerunt?
quemadmodum autem obedire et parere volun∣tati
architecti aer, ignis, aqua, terra potue∣runt?</HI>
If this argument, I say, had any force
in former ages; how much greater must it have
at present; when the bounds of Nature are so in∣finitely
enlarged, and such a magnificent scene is
opened to us? It is still more unreasonable to
form our idea of so unlimited a cause from our
experience of the narrow productions of human
design and invention.</P>
<P>The discoveries by microscopes, as they open a
new universe in miniature, are still objections,
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
according to you; arguments, according to me.
The farther we push our researches of this kind,
we are still led to infer the universal cause of all to
be vastly different from mankind, or from any
object of human experience and observation.</P>
<P>And what say you to the discoveries in anatomy,
chymistry, botany? — These surely are no ob∣jections,
replied CLEANTHES: they only disco∣ver
new instances of art and contrivance. It is
still the image of mind reflected on us from innu∣merable
objects. Add, a mind <HI>like the hu∣man,</HI>
said PHILO. I know of no other, re∣plied
CLEANTHES. And the liker the bet∣ter,
insisted PHILO. To be sure, said CLE∣ANTHES.</P>
<P>Now, CLEANTHES, said PHILO, with an air
of alacrity and triumph, mark the consequences.
<HI>First,</HI> By this method of reasoning, you renounce
all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of the
Deity. For as the cause ought only to be propor∣tioned
to the effect, and the effect, so far as it
falls under our cognisance, is not infinite; what
pretensions have we, upon your suppositions, to
ascribe that attribute to the divine Being? You
will still insist, that, by removing him so much
from all similarity to human creatures, we give
into the most arbitrary hypothesis, and at the
same time, weaken all proofs of his existence.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> You have no reason, on your theory,
for ascribing perfection to the Deity, even in his
finite capacity; or for supposing him free from
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
every error, mistake, or incoherence in his un∣dertakings.
There are many inexplicable diffi∣culties
in the works of Nature, which, if we al∣low
a perfect author to be proved <HI>a priori,</HI> are
easily solved, and become only seeming difficul∣ties,
from the narrow capacity of man, who can∣not
trace infinite relations. But according to your
method of reasoning, these difficulties become all
real; and perhaps will be insisted on, as new in∣stances
of likeness to human art and contrivance.
At least, you must acknowledge, that it is impos∣sible
for us to tell, from our limited views, whe∣ther
this system contains any great faults, or de∣serves
any considerable praise, if compared to
other possible, and even real systems. Could a
peasant, if the AENEID were read to him, pro∣nounce
that poem to be absolutely faultless, or
even assign to it its proper rank among the pro∣ductions
of human wit; he, who had never seen
any other production?</P>
<P>But were this world ever so perfect a produc∣tion,
it must still remain uncertain, whether all
the excellencies of the work can justly be ascri∣bed
to the workman. If we survey a ship, what
an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of
the carpenter, who framed so complicated useful
and beautiful a machine? And what surprise
must we feel, when we find him a stupid mechanic,
who imitated others, and copied an art, which,
through a long succession of ages, after multiplied
trials, mistakes, corrections, deliberations, and
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
controversies, had been gradually improving?
Many worlds might have been botched and bun∣gled,
throughout an eternity, ere this system
was struck out: much labour lost: many fruit∣less
trials made: and a slow, but continued im∣provement
carried on during infinite ages in the
art of world-making. In such subjects, who can
determine, where the truth; nay, who can con∣jecture
where the probability, lies; amidst a great
number of hypotheses which may be proposed,
and a still greater number, which may be ima∣gined?</P>
<P>And what shadow of an argument, continued
PHILO, can you produce, from your hypothesis,
to prove the unity of the Deity? A great num∣ber
of men join in building a house or ship, in
rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth: why
may not several deities combine in contriving and
framing a world? This is only so much greater
similarity to human affairs. By sharing the work
among several, we may so much farther limit the
attributes of each, and get rid of that extensive
power and knowledge, which must be supposed in
one deity, and which, according to you, can on∣ly
serve to weaken the proof of his existence.
And if such foolish, such vicious creatures as man
can yet often unite in framing and executing one
plan; how much more those deities or daemons,
whom we may suppose several degrees more per∣fect?</P>
<P>To multiply causes, without necessity, is in∣deed
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
contrary to true philosophy: but this prin∣ciple
applies not to the present case. Were one
deity antecedently proved by your theory, who
were possessed of every attribute, requisite to the
production of the universe; it would be needless,
I own (though not absurd) to suppose any other
deity existent. But while it is still a question,
Whether all these attributes are united in one
subject, or dispersed among several independent
beings: by what phenomena in nature can we
pretend to decide the controversy? Where we
see a body raised in a scale, we are sure that there
is in the opposite scale, however concealed from
sight, some counterpoising weight equal to it:
but it is still allowed to doubt, whether that
weight be an aggregate of several distinct bodies,
or one uniform united mass. And if the weight
requisite very much exceeds any thing which we
have ever seen conjoined in any single body, the
former supposition becomes still more probable
and natural. An intelligent being of such vast
power and capacity, as is necessary to produce the
universe, or, to speak in the language of ancient
philosophy, so prodigious an animal, exceeds all
analogy and even comprehension.</P>
<P>But farther, CLEANTHES; men are mortal,
and renew their species by generation; and this
is common to all living creatures. The two great
sexes of male and female, says MILTON, ani∣mate
the world. Why must this circumstance,
so universal, so essential, be excluded from those
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
numerous and limited deities? Behold then the
theogony of ancient times brought back upon us.</P>
<P>And why not become a perfect Anthropomor∣phite?
Why not assert the deity or deities to be
corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears,
&amp;c.? EPICURUS maintained, that no man had
ever seen reason but in a human figure; therefore
the gods must have a human figure. And this
argument, which is deservedly so much ridiculed
by CICERO, becomes, according to you, solid
and philosophical.</P>
<P>In a word, CLEANTHES, a man, who follows
your hypothesis, is able, perhaps, to assert, or
conjecture, that the universe, sometime, arose
from something like design: but beyond that po∣sition
he cannot ascertain one single circumstance,
and is left afterwards to fix every point of his the∣ology,
by the utmost licence of fancy and hypo∣thesis.
This world, for aught he knows, is very
faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior
standard; and was only the first rude essay of
some infant deity, who afterwards abandoned it,
ashamed of his lame performance: it is the work
only of some dependent, inferior deity; and is
the object of derision to his superiors: it is the
production of old age and dotage in some super∣annuated
deity; and ever since his death, has
run on at adventures, from the first impulse and
active force, which it received from him. You
justly give signs of horror, DEMEA, at these
strange suppositions: but these, and a thousand
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
more of the same kind, are CLEANTHES's sup∣positions,
not mine. From the moment the attri∣butes
of the Deity are supposed finite, all these
have place. And I cannot, for my part, think,
that so wild and unsettled a system of theology is,
in any respect, preferable to none at all.</P>
<P>These suppositions I absolutely disown, cried
CLEANTHES: they strike me, however, with no
horror; especially, when proposed in that ram∣bling
way, in which they drop from you. On
the contrary, they give me pleasure, when I see,
that, by the utmost indulgence of your imagina∣tion,
you never get rid of the hypothesis of de∣sign
in the universe; but are obliged, at every
turn, to have recourse to it. To this concession I
adhere steadily; and this I regard as a sufficient
foundation for religion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT must be a slight fabric, indeed, said DE∣MEA,
which can be erected on so tottering a
foundation. While we are uncertain, whether
there is one deity or many; whether the deity
or deities, to whom we owe our existence, be
perfect or imperfect, subordinate or supreme,
dead or alive; what trust or confidence can we
repose in them? What devotion or worship ad∣dress
to them? What veneration or obedience
pay them? To all the purposes of life, the theory
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
of religion becomes altogether useless:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part VI.</NOTE> and even
with regard to speculative consequences, its un∣certainty,
according to you, must render it total∣ly
precarious and unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>To render it still more unsatisfactory, said
PHILO, there occurs to me another hypothesis,
which must acquire an air of probability from the
method of reasoning so much insisted on by CLE∣ANTHES.
That like effects arise from like
causes: this principle he supposes the foundation
of all religion. But there is another principle of
the same kind, no less certain, and derived from
the same source of experience; That where several
known circumstances are observed to be similar,
the unknown will also be found similar. Thus,
if we see the limbs of a human body, we con∣clude,
that it is also attended with a human head,
though hid from us. Thus, if we see, through a
chink in a wall, a small part of the sun, we con∣clude,
that, were the wall removed, we should see
the whole body. In short, this method of reason∣ing
is so obvious and familiar, that no scruple can
ever be made with regard to its solidity.</P>
<P>Now if we survey the universe, so far as it falls
under our knowledge, it bears a great resem∣blance
to an animal or organized body, and seems
actuated with a like principle of life and motion.
A continual circulation of matter in it produces
no disorder: a continual waste in every part is
incessantly repaired: the closest sympathy is per∣ceived
throughout the entire system: and each
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
part or member, in performing its proper offices,
operates both to its own preservation and to that
of the whole. The world, therefore, I infer, is
an animal, and the Deity is the SOUL of the
world, actuating it, and actuated by it.</P>
<P>You have too much learning, CLEANTHES,
to be at all surprised at this opinion, which, you
know, was maintained by almost all the Theists
of antiquity, and chiefly prevails in their discour∣ses
and reasonings. For though sometimes the
ancient philosophers reason from final causes, as
if they thought the world the workmanship of
God; yet it appears rather their favorite notion
to consider it as his body, whose organization
renders it subservient to him. And it must be
confessed, that as the universe resembles more a
human body than it does the works of human art
and contrivance; if our limited analogy could
ever, with any propriety, be extended to the
whole of nature, the inference seems juster in fa∣vour
of the ancient than the modern theory.</P>
<P>There are many other advantages too, in the
former theory, which recommended it to the an∣cient
Theologians. Nothing more repugnant to all
their notions, because nothing more repugnant to
common experience, than mind without body; a
mere spiritual substance, which fell not under
their senses nor comprehension, and of which they
had not observed one single instance throughout
all nature. Mind and body they knew, because
they felt both: an order, arrangement, organi∣zation,
or internal machinery in both they like∣wise
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
knew, after the same manner: and it could
not but seem reasonable to transfer this experience
to the universe, and to suppose the divine mind
and body to be also coeval, and to have, both of
them, order and arrangement naturally inherent
in them, and inseparable from them.</P>
<P>Here therefore is a new species of <HI>Anthropo∣morphism,</HI>
CLEANTHES, on which you may de∣liberate;
and a theory which seems not liable to
any considerable difficulties. You are too much
superior surely to <HI>systematical prejudices,</HI> to find
any more difficulty in supposing an animal body
to be, originally, of itself, or from unknown
causes, possessed of order and organization, than
in supposing a similar order to belong to mind.
But the <HI>vulgar prejudice,</HI> that body and mind
ought always to accompany each other, ought
not, one should think, to be entirely neglected;
since it is founded on <HI>vulgar experience,</HI> the on∣ly
guide which you profess to follow in all these
theological enquiries. And if you assert, that
our limited experience is an unequal standard, by
which to judge of the unlimited extent of nature;
you entirely abandon your own hypothesis, and
must thenceforward adopt our Mysticism, as you
call it, and admit of the absolute incomprehensi∣bility
of the Divine Nature.</P>
<P>This theory, I own, replied CLEANTHES, has
never before occurred to me, though a pretty na∣tural
one; and I cannot readily, upon so short an
examination and reflection, deliver any opinion
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
with regard to it. You are very scrupulous,
indeed, said PHILO; were I to examine any sy∣stem
of yours, I should not have acted with half
that caution and reserve, in starting objections
and difficulties to it. However, if any thing oc∣cur
to you, you will oblige us by proposing it.</P>
<P>Why then, replied CLEANTHES, it seems to
me, that, though the world does, in many circum∣stances,
resemble an animal body; yet is the ana∣logy
also defective in many circumstances, the
most material: no organs of sense; no seat of
thought or reason; no one precise origin of mo∣tion
and action. In short, it seems to bear a
stronger resemblance to a vegetable than to an a∣nimal,
and your inference would be so far incon∣clusive
in favour of the soul of the world.</P>
<P>But in the next place, your theory seems to im∣ply
the eternity of the world; and that is a prin∣ciple,
which, I think, can be refuted by the
strongest reasons and probabilities. I shall suggest
an argument to this purpose, which, I believe,
has not been insisted on by any writer. Those,
who reason from the late origin of arts and sci∣ences,
though their inference wants not force,
may perhaps be refuted by considerations, derived
from the nature of human society, which is in
continual revolution, between ignorance and
knowledge, liberty and slavery, riches and pover∣ty;
so that it is impossible for us, from our limi∣ted
experience, to foretell with assurance what e∣vents
may or may not be expected. Ancient
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
learning and history seem to have been in great
danger of entirely perishing after the inundation
of the barbarous nations; and had these convul∣sions
continued a little longer, or been a little more
violent, we should not probably have now known
what passed in the world a few centuries before
us. Nay, were it not for the superstition of the
Popes, who preserved a little jargon of LATIN,
in order to support the appearance of an ancient
and universal church, that tongue must have been
utterly lost: in which case, the Western world,
being totally barbarous, would not have been in
a fit disposition for receiving the GREEK language
and learning, which was conveyed to them after
the sacking of CONSTANTINOPLE. When learn∣ing
and books had been extinguished, even the
mechanical arts would have fallen considerably to
decay; and it is easily imagined, that fable or
tradition might ascribe to them a much later ori∣gin
than the true one. This vulgar argument,
therefore, against the eternity of the world, seems
a little precarious.</P>
<P>But here appears to be the foundation of a
better argument. LUCULLUS was the first that
brought cherry-trees from ASIA to EUROPE;
though that tree thrives so well in many EU∣ROPEAN
climates, that it grows in the woods
without any culture. Is it possible, that, through∣out
a whole eternity, no EUROPEAN had ever
passed into ASIA, and thought of transplanting
so delicious a fruit into his own country? Or if
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
the tree was once transplanted and propagated,
how could it ever afterwards perish? Empires may
rise and fall; liberty and slavery succeed alter∣nately;
ignorance and knowledge give place to
each other; but the cherry-tree will still remain
in the woods of GREECE, SPAIN and ITALY,
and will never be affected by the revolutions of
human society.</P>
<P>It is not two thousand years since vines were
transplanted into FRANCE; though there is no
climate in the world more favourable to them.
It is not three centuries since horses, cows, sheep,
swine, dogs, corn were known in AMERICA. Is
it possible, that, during the revolutions of a whole
eternity, there never arose a COLUMBUS, who
might open the communication between EUROPE
and that continent? We may as well imagine,
that all men would wear stockings for ten thou∣sand
years, and never have the sense to think of
garters to tie them. All these seem convincing
proofs of the youth, or rather infancy of the
world; as being founded on the operation of
principles more constant and steady, than those
by which human society is governed and direct∣ed.
Nothing less than a total convulsion of the
elements will ever destroy all the EUROPEAN
animals and vegetables, which are now to be
found in the Western world.</P>
<P>And what argument have you against such
convulsions? replied PHILO. Strong and almost
incontestable proofs may be traced over the whole
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
earth, that every part of this globe has continued
for many ages entirely covered with water. And
though order were supposed inseparable from
matter, and inherent in it; yet may matter be
susceptible of many and great revolutions, through
the endless periods of eternal duration. The in∣cessant
changes, to which every part of it is sub∣ject,
seem to intimate some such general trans∣sormations;
though at the same time, it is ob∣servable,
that all the changes and corruptions,
of which we have ever had experience, are but
passages from one state of order to another; nor
can matter ever rest in total deformity and confu∣sion.
What we see in the parts, we may infer
in the whole; at least, that is the method of
reasoning, on which you rest your whole theory.
And were I obliged to defend any particular sy∣stem
of this nature (which I never willingly should
do) I esteem none more plausible, than that
which ascribes an eternal, inherent principle of
order to the world; though attended with great
and continual revolutions and alterations. This
at once solves all difficulties; and if the solution,
by being so general, is not entirely complete and
satisfactory, it is, at least, a theory, that we must,
sooner or later, have recourse to, whatever sy∣stem
we embrace. How could things have been
as they are, were there not an original, inherent
principle of order somewhere, in thought or in
matter? And it is very indifferent to which of
these we give the preference. Chance has no
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
place, on any hypothesis, sceptical or religious.
Every thing is surely governed by steady, invio∣lable
laws. And were the inmost essence of
things laid open to us, we should then discover
a scene, of which, at present, we can have no
idea. Instead of admiring the order of natural
beings, we should clearly see, that it was abso∣lutely
impossible for them, in the smallest article,
ever to admit of any other disposition.</P>
<P>Were any one inclined to revive the ancient Pa∣gan
Theology, which maintained, as we learn from
Hesiod, that this globe was governed by 30,000
deities, who arose from the unknown powers of
nature: you would naturally object, CLEAN∣THES,
that nothing is gained by this hypothesis;
and that it is as easy to suppose all men and ani∣mals,
beings more numerous, but less perfect,
to have sprung immediately from a like origin.
Push the same inference a step farther; and you
will find a numerous society of deities as expli∣cable
as one universal deity, who possesses, with∣in
himself, the powers and perfections of the
whole society. All these systems, then, of Scep∣ticism,
Polytheism, and Theism, you must allow,
on your principles, to be on a like footing, and
that no one of them has any advantages over the
others. You may thence learn the fallacy of
your principles.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="part">
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
<HEAD>PART VII.</HEAD>
<P>BUT here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part VII.</NOTE> continued PHILO, in examining
the ancient system of the soul of the world, there
strikes me, all on a sudden, a new idea, which,
if just, must go near to subvert all your reason∣ing,
and destroy even your first inferences, on
which you repose such confidence. If the uni∣verse
bears a greater likeness to animal bodies
and to vegetables, than to the works of human
art, it is more probable, that its cause resembles
the cause of the former than that of the latter,
and its origin ought rather to be ascribed to ge∣neration
or vegetation than to reason or design.
Your conclusion, even according to your own
principles, is therefore lame and defective.</P>
<P>Pray open up this argument a little farther,
said DEMEA. For I do not rightly apprehend it,
in that concise manner, in which you have ex∣pressed
it.</P>
<P>Our friend CLEANTHES, replied PHILO,
as you have heard, asserts, that since no question
of fact can be proved otherwise than by experi∣ence,
the existence of a Deity admits not of proof
from any other medium. The world, says he,
resembles the works of human contrivance:
Therefore its cause must also resemble that of the
other. Here we may remark, that the opera∣tion
of one very small part of nature, to wit
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
man, upon another very small part, to wit that
inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the
rule, by which CLEANTHES judges of the ori∣gin
of the whole; and he measures objects, so
widely disproportioned, by the same individual
standard. But to wave all objections drawn from
this topic; I affirm, that there are other parts
of the universe (besides the machines of human
invention) which bear still a greater resemblance
to the fabric of the world, and which therefore
afford a better conjecture concerning the univer∣sal
origin of this system. These parts are animals
and vegetables. The world plainly resembles
more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a
watch or a knitting-loom. Its cause, therefore,
it is more probable, resembles the cause of the
former. The cause of the former is generation
or vegetation. The cause, therefore, of the
world, we may infer to be something similar or
analagous to generation or vegetation.</P>
<P>But how is it conceivable, said DEMEA, that
the world can arise from any thing similar to ve∣getation
or generation?</P>
<P>Very easily, replied PHILO. In like manner
as a tree sheds its seed into the neighbouring
fields, and produces other trees; so the great ve∣getable,
the world, or this planetary system, pro∣duces
within itself certain seeds, which, being
scattered into the surrounding chaos, vegetate
into new worlds. A comet, for instance, is the
seed of a world; and after it has been fully
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
ripened, by passing from sun to sun, and star to
star, it is at last tost into the unformed elements,
which every where surround this universe, and
immedialy sprouts up into a new system.</P>
<P>Or if, for the sake of variety (for I see no o∣ther
advantage) we should suppose this world to
be an animal; a comet is the egg of this animal;
and in like manner as an ostrich lays its egg in
the sand, which, without any farther care, hatch∣es
the egg, and produces a new animal; so.......I
understand you, says DEMEA: But what wild,
arbitrary suppositions are these? What <HI>data</HI>
have you for such extraordinary conclusions? And
is the slight, imaginary resemblance of the world
to a vegetable or an animal sufficient to establish
the same inference with regard to both? Ob∣jects,
which are in general so widely different;
ought they to be a standard for each other?</P>
<P>Right, cries PHILO: This is the topic on which
I have all along insisted. I have still asserted, that
we have no <HI>data</HI> to establish any system of cos∣mogony.
Our experience, so imperfect in it∣self,
and so limited both in extent and duration,
can afford us no probable conjecture concerning
the whole of things. But if we must needs fix
on some hypothesis; by what rule, pray, ought
we to determine our choice? Is there any other
rule than the greater similarity of the objects com∣pared?
And does not a plant or an animal, which
springs from vegetation or generation, bear a
stronger resemblance to the world, than does
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
any artificial machine, which arises from reason
and design?</P>
<P>But what is this vegetation and generation of
which you talk, said DEMEA? Can you explain
their operations, and anatomize that fine internal
structure, on which they depend?</P>
<P>As much, at least, replied PHILO, as CLE∣ANTHES
can explain the operations of reason,
or anatomize that internal structure, on which <HI>it</HI>
depends. But without any such elaborate dis∣quisitions,
when I see an animal, I infer, that it
sprang from generation; and that with as great
certainty as you conclude a house to have been
reared by design. These words, <HI>generation,
reason,</HI> mark only certain powers and energies
in nature, whose effects are known, but whose
essence is incomprehensible; and one of these
principles, more than the other, has no privilege
for being made a standard to the whole of na∣ture.</P>
<P>In reality, DEMEA, it may reasonably be ex∣pected,
that the larger the views are which we
take of things, the better will they conduct us
in our conclusions concerning such extraordinary
and such magnificent subjects. In this little cor∣ner
of the world alone, there are four prin∣ciples,
<HI>Reason, Instinct, Generation, Vegeta∣tion,</HI>
which are similar to each other, and are
the causes of similar effects. What a num∣ber
of other principles may we naturally suppose
in the immense extent and variety of the universe,
could we travel from planet to planet and from
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
system to system, in order to examine each part
of this mighty fabric? Any one of these four
principles above mentioned (and a hundred o∣thers,
which lie open to our conjecture) may
afford us a theory, by which to judge of the o∣rigin
of the world; and it is a palpable and e∣gregious
partiality, to confine our view entirely
to that principle, by which our own minds ope∣rate.
Were this principle more intelligible on
that account, such a partiality might be some∣what
excuseable: But reason, in its internal fa∣bric
and structure, is really as little known to us
as instinct or vegetation; and perhaps even that
vague, undeterminate word, <HI>Nature,</HI> to which
the vulgar refer every thing, is not at the bot∣tom
more inexplicable. The effects of these
principles are all known to us from experience:
But the principles themselves, and their manner
of operation are totally unknown: Not is it less
intelligible, or less conformable to experience to
say, that the world arose by vegetation from a
seed shed by another world, than to say that it
arose from a divine reason or contrivance, ac∣cording
to the sense in which CLEANTHES un∣derstands
it.</P>
<P>But methinks, said DEMEA, if the world had
a vegetative quality, and could sow the seeds of
new worlds into the infinite chaos, this power
would be still an additional argument for design
in its author. For whence could arise so won∣derful
a faculty but from design? Or how can
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
order spring from any thing, which perceives not
that order which it bestows?</P>
<P>You need only look around you, replied
PHILO, to satisfy yourself with regard to this
question. A tree bestows order and organization
on that tree, which springs from it, without
knowing the order: an animal, in the same
manner, on its offspring: a bird, on its nest:
and instances of this kind are even more frequent
in the world, than those of order, which arise
from reason and contrivance. To say that all
this order in animals and vegetables proceeds ul∣timately
from design, is begging the question;
nor can that great point be ascertained otherwise
than by proving <HI>a priori,</HI> both that order is,
from its nature, inseparably attached to thought,
and that it can never, of itself, or from original
unknown principles, belong to matter.</P>
<P>But farther, DEMEA; this objection, which
you urge, can never be made use of by CLE∣ANTHES,
without renouncing a defence, which
he has already made against one of my objec∣tions.
When I enquired concerning the cause
of that supreme reason and intelligence, into
which he resolves every thing; he told me, that
the impossibility of satisfying such enquiries could
never be admitted as an objection in any species
of philosophy. <HI>We must stop somewhere,</HI> says
he; <HI>nor is it ever within the reach of human
capacity to explain ultimate causes, or show
the last connections of any objects. It is suffi∣cient,
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
if the steps, so far as we go, are sup∣ported
by experience and observation.</HI> Now,
that vegetation and generation, as well as reason,
are experienced to be principles of order in na∣ture,
is undeniable. If I rest my system of cos∣mogony
on the former, preferably to the latter,
'tis at my choice. The matter seems entirely
arbitrary. And when CLEANTHES asks me
what is the cause of my great vegetative or gene∣rative
faculty, I am equally intitled to ask him
the cause of his great reasoning principle. These
questions we have agreed to forbear on both
sides; and it is chiefly his interest on the present
occasion to stick to this agreement. Judging by
our limited and imperfect experience, generation
has some privileges above reason: For we see e∣very
day the latter arise from the former, never
the former from the latter.</P>
<P>Compare, I beseech you, the consequences on
both sides. The world, say I, resembles an ani∣mal,
therefore it is an animal, therefore it arose
from generation. The steps, I confess, are wide;
yet there is some small appearance of analogy in
each step. The world, says CLEANTHES, re∣sembles
a machine, therefore it is a machine,
therefore it arose from design. The steps here are
equally wide, and the analogy less striking. And
if he pretends to carry on <HI>my</HI> hypothesis a step
farther, and to infer design or reason from the
great principle of generation, on which I insist;
I may, with better authority, use the same free∣dom
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
to push farther his hypothesis, and infer a
divine generation or theogony from his principle
of reason. I have at least some faint shadow of
experience, which is the utmost, that can ever be
attained in the present subject. Reason, in innu∣merable
instances, is observed to arise from the
principle of generation, and never to arise from
any other principle.</P>
<P>HESIOD, and all the ancient Mythologists,
were so struck with this analogy, that they uni∣versally
explained the origin of nature from an a∣nimal
birth, and copulation. PLATO too, so far
as he is intelligible, seems to have adopted some
such notion in his TIMAEUS.</P>
<P>The BRAMINS assert, that the world arose
from an insinite spider, who spun this whole com∣plicated
mass from his bowels, and annihilates af∣terwards
the whole or any part of it, by absorb∣ing
it again, and resolving it into his own essence.
Here is a species of cosmogony, which appears to
us ridiculous; because a spider is a little contemp∣tible
animal, whose operations we are never like∣ly
to take for a model of the whole universe.
But still here is a new species of analogy, even in
our globe. And were there a planet, wholly in∣habited
by spiders, (which is very possible) this
inference would there appear as natural and irre∣fragable
as that which in our planet ascribes the
origin of all things to design and intelligence, as
explained by CLEANTHES. Why an orderly sy∣stem
may not be spun from the belly as well as
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
from the brain, it will be difficult for him to give
a satisfactory reason.</P>
<P>I must confess, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES,
that, of all men living, the task which you have
undertaken, of raising doubts and objections,
suits you best, and seems, in a manner, natural
and unavoidable to you. So great is your fertili∣ty
of invention, that I am not ashamed to acknow∣ledge
myself unable, on a sudden, to solve regu∣larly
such out-of-the-way difficulties as you inces∣santly
start upon me: though I clearly see, in ge∣neral,
their fallacy and error. And I question
not, but you are yourself, at present, in the same
case, and have not the solution so ready as the
objection; while you must be sensible, that com∣mon
sense and reason is entirely against you, and
that such whimsies as you have delivered, may
puzzle, but never can convince us.</P>

<P>WHAT you ascribe to the fertility of my inven∣tion,
replied PHILO, is entirely owing to the na∣ture
of the subject. In subjects, adapted to the
narrow compass of human reason, there is com∣monly
but one determination, which carries pro∣bability
or conviction with it; and to a man of
sound judgement, all other suppositions, but that

I believe that I could, in an instant, propose o∣ther

some faint appearance of truth; though it is a

one of mine be the true system.</P>
<P>For instance; what if I should revive the old

and I believe, justly, esteemed the most absurd
system, that has yet been proposed; yet, I know
not, whether, with a few alterations, it might
not be brought to bear a faint appearance of pro∣bability.
Instead of supposing matter infinite, as
EPICURUS did; let us suppose it finite. A finite
number of particles is only susceptible of finite
transpositions: and it must happen, in an eternal
duration, that every possible order or position
must be tried an infinite number of times. This
world, therefore, with all its events, even the
most minute, has before been produced and de∣stroyed,
and will again be produced and de∣stroyed,
without any bounds and limitations. No
one, who has a conception of the powers of in∣finite,
in comparison of finite, will ever scruple
this determination.</P>
<P>But this supposes, said DEMEA, that matter
can acquire motion, without any voluntary agent
or first mover.</P>
<P>And where is the difficulty, replied PHILO, of
that supposition? Every event, before experience,
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
is equally difficult and incomprehensible; and e∣very
event, after experience, is equally easy and
intelligible. Motion, in many instances, from gra∣vity,
from elasticity, from electricity, begins in mat∣ter,
without any known voluntary agent; and to
suppose always, in these cases, an unknown vo∣luntary
agent, is mere hypothesis; and hypothe∣sis
attended with no advantages. The beginning
of motion in matter itself is as conceivable <HI>a pri∣ori</HI>
as its communication from mind and intelli∣gence.</P>
<P>Besides; why may not motion have been pro∣pagated
by impulse through all eternity, and the
same stock of it, or nearly the same, be still up∣held
in the universe? As much as is lost by the
composition of motion, as much is gained by its
resolution. And whatever the causes are, the fact
is certain, that matter is, and always has been in
continual agitation, as far as human experience
or tradition reaches. There is not probably, at
present, in the whole universe, one particle of
matter at absolute rest.</P>
<P>And this very consideration too, continued
PHILO, which we have stumbled on in the course
of the argument, suggests a new hypothesis of
cosmogony, that is not absolutely absurd and im∣probable.
Is there a system, an order, an oeco∣nomy
of things, by which matter can preserve
that perpetual agitation, which seems essential to
it, and yet maintain a constancy in the forms,
which it produces? There certainly is such an
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
oeconomy: for this is actually the case with the
present world. The continual motion of matter,
therefore, in less than infinite transpositions, must
produce this oeconomy or order; and by its very
nature, that order, when once established, sup∣ports
itself, for many ages, if not to eternity.
But where-ever matter is so poized, arranged, and
adjusted as to continue in perpetual motion, and
yet preserve a constancy in the forms, its situation
must, of necessity, have all the same appearance
of art and contrivance, which we observe at pre∣sent.
All the parts of each form must have a re∣lation
to each other, and to the whole: and the
whole itself must have a relation to the other parts
of the universe; to the element, in which the
form subsists; to the materials, with which it re∣pairs
its waste and decay; and to every other
form, which is hostile or friendly. A defect in
any of these particulars destroys the form; and
the matter, of which it is composed, is again set
loose, and is thrown into irregular motions and
fermentations, till it unite itself to some other re∣gular
form. If no such form be prepared to re∣ceive
it, and if there be a great quantity of this
corrupted matter in the universe, the universe it∣self
is entirely disordered; whether it be the fee∣ble
embryo of a world in its first beginnings, that
is thus destroyed, or the rotten carcass of one,
languishing in old age and infirmity. In either
case, a chaos ensues; till finite, though innume∣rable
revolutions produce at last some forms,
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
whose parts and organs are so adjusted as to sup∣port
the forms amidst a continued succession of
matter.</P>
<P>Suppose, (for we shall endeavour to vary the
expression) that matter were thrown into any po∣sition,
by a blind, unguided force; it is evident
that this first position must in all probability be
the most confused and most disorderly imaginable,
without any resemblance to those works of human
contrivance, which, along with a symmetry of
parts, discover an adjustment of means to ends
and a tendency to self-preservation. If the actua∣ting
force cease after this operation, matter must
remain for ever in disorder, and continue an im∣mense
chaos, without any proportion or activity.
But suppose, that the actuating force, whatever it
be, still continues in matter, this first position
will immediately give place to a second, which
will likewise in all probability be as disorderly as
the first, and so on, through many successions of
changes and revolutions. No particular order or
position ever continues a moment unaltered. The
original force, still remaining in activity, gives a
perpetual restlessness to matter. Every possible si∣tuation
is produced, and instantly destroyed. If
a glimpse or dawn of order appears for a moment,
it is instantly hurried away and confounded, by
that never-ceasing force, which actuates every
part of matter.</P>
<P>Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a
continued succession of chaos and disorder. But
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
is it not possible that it may settle at last, so as not
to lose its motion and active force (for that we
have supposed inherent in it) yet so as to preserve
an uniformity of appearance, amidst the conti∣nual
motion and fluctuation of its parts? This
we find to be the case with the universe at present.
Every individual is perpetually changing, and e∣very
part of every individual, and yet the whole
remains, in appearance, the same. May we not
hope for such a position, or rather be assured of
it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided mat∣ter,
and may not this account for all the appear∣ing
wisdom and contrivance, which is in the uni∣verse?
Let us contemplate the subject a little,
and we shall find, that this adjustment, if attained
by matter, of a seeming stability in the forms,
with a real and perpetual revolution or motion of
parts, affords a plausible, if not a true solution of
the difficulty.</P>
<P>It is in vain, therefore, to insist upon the uses
of the parts in animals or vegetables and their
curious adjustment to each other. I would fain
know how an animal could subsist, unless its parts
were so adjusted? Do we not find, that it imme∣diately
perishes whenever this adjustment ceases,
and that its matter corrupting tries some new
form? It happens, indeed, that the parts of the
world are so well adjusted, that some regular form
immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter:
and if it were not so, could the world subsist?
Must it not dissolve as well as the animal, and
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
pass through new positions and situations; till in
a great, but finite succession, it fall at last into the
present or some such order?</P>
<P>It is well, replied CLEANTHES, you told us,
that this hypothesis was suggested on a sudden, in
the course of the argument. Had you had leisure
to examine it, you would soon have perceived the
insuperable objections, to which it is exposed.
No form, you say, can subsist, unless it possess
those powers and organs, requisite for its subsist∣ence:
some new order or oeconomy must be
tried, and so on, without intermission; till at last
some order, which can support and maintain it∣self,
is fallen upon. But according to this hypo∣thesis,
whence arise the many conveniencies and
advantages, which men and all animals possess?
Two eyes, two ears, are not absolutely necessary
for the subsistence of the species. Human race
might have been propagated and preserved, without
horses, dogs, cows, sheep, and those innumerable
fruits and products, which serve to our satisfac∣tion
and enjoyment. If no camels had been cre∣ated
for the use of man in the sandy deserts of
AFRICA and ARABIA, would the world have
been dissolved? If no loadstone had been framed
to give that wonderful and useful direction to the
needle, would human society and the human
kind have been immediately extinguished?
Though the maxims of Nature be in general very
frugal, yet instances of this kind are far from be∣ing
rare; and any one of them is a sufficient
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
proof of design, and of a benevolent design,
which gave rise to the order and arrangement of
the universe.</P>
<P>At least, you may safely infer, said PHILO,
that the foregoing hypothesis is so far incomplete
and imperfect; which I shall not scruple to allow.
But can we ever reasonably expect greater suc∣cess
in any attempts of this nature? Or can we
ever hope to erect a system of cosmogony, that
will be liable to no exceptions, and will contain
no circumstance repugnant to our limited and
imperfect experience of the analogy of Nature?
Your theory itself cannot surely pretend to any
such advantage; even though you have run into
<HI>Authropomorphism,</HI> the better to preserve a
conformity to common experience. Let us once
more put it to trial. In all instances which we
have ever seen, ideas are copied from real ob∣jects,
and are ectypal, not archetypal, to express
myself in learned terms: You reverse this order,
and give thought the precedence. In all instances
which we have ever seen, thought has no in∣fluence
upon matter, except where that matter
is so conjoined with it, as to have an equal re∣ciprocal
influence upon it. No animal can move
immediately any thing but the members of its
own body; and indeed, the equality of action
and re-action seems to be an universal law of Na∣ture:
But your theory implies a contradiction to
this experience. These instances, with many
more, which it were easy to collect, (particularly
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
the supposition of a mind or system of thought
that is eternal, or in other words, an animal in∣generable
and immortal) these instances, I say,
may teach, all of us, sobriety in condemning each
other; and let us see, that as no system of this
kind ought ever to be received from a slight a∣nalogy,
so neither ought any to be rejected on
account of a small incongruity. For that is an
inconvenience, from which we can justly pro∣nounce
no one to be exempted.</P>
<P>All religious systems, it is confessed, are sub∣ject
to great and insuperable difficulties. Each
disputant triumphs in his turn; while he carries
on an offensive war, and exposes the absurdities,
barbarities, and pernicious tenets of his antago∣nist.
But all of them, on the whole, prepare a
complete triumph for the <HI>Sceptic;</HI> who tells them,
that no system ought ever to be embraced with
regard to such subjects: For this plain reason,
that no absurdity ought ever to be assented to with
regard to any subject. A total suspense of judge∣ment
is here our only reasonable resource. And
if every attack, as is commonly observed, and
no defence, among Theologians, is successful;
how complete must be <HI>his</HI> victory, who remains
always, with all mankind, on the offensive, and
has himself no fixed station or abiding city, which
he is ever, on any occasion, obliged to desend?</P>

<HEAD>PART IX.</HEAD>
<P>BUT if so many difficulties attend the argu∣ment
<HI>a posteriori,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part IX.</NOTE> said DEMEA; had we not
better adhere to that simple and sublime argument
<HI>a priori,</HI> which, by offering to us infallible de∣monstration,
cuts off at once all doubt and diffi∣culty?
By this argument too, we may prove the
INFINITY of the divine attributes, which, I
am afraid, can never be ascertained with certainty
from any other topic. For how can an effect,
which either is finite, or, for aught we know,
may be so; how can such an effect, I say, prove
an infinite cause? The unity too of the Divine
Nature, it is very difficult, if not absolutely im∣possible,
to deduce merely from contemplating
the works of nature; nor will the uniformity a∣lone
of the plan, even were it allowed, give us
any assurance of that attribute. Whereas the ar∣gument
<HI>a priori..</HI>....</P>
<P>You seem to reason, DEMEA, interposed CLE∣ANTHES,
as if those advantages and convenien∣cies
in the abstract argument were full proofs of
its solidity. But it is first proper, in my opinion,
to determine what argument of this nature you
chuse to insist on; and we shall afterwards, from
itself, better than from its <HI>useful</HI> consequences,
endeavour to determine what value we ought to
put upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="93"/>
The argument, replied DEMEA, which I would
insist on is the common one. Whatever exists
must have a cause or reason of its existence; it
being absolutely impossible for any thing thing to
produce itself, or be the cause of its own exist∣ence.
In mounting up, therefore, from effects
to causes, we must either go on in tracing an
infinite succession, without any ultimate cause at
all, or must at last have recourse to some ulti∣mate
cause, that is <HI>necessarily</HI> existent: Now
that the first supposition is absurd may be thus
proved. In the infinite chain or succession of
causes and effects, each single effect is determined
to exist by the power and efficacy of that cause,
which immediately preceded; but the whole e∣ternal
chain or succession, taken together, is not
determined or caused by any thing: and yet it
is evident that it requires a cause or reason, as
much as any particular object, which begins to
exist in time. The question is still reasonable,
Why this particular succession of causes existed
from eternity, and not any other succession, or
no succession at all. If there be no necessarily-existent
being, any supposition, which can be
formed, is equally possible; nor is there any more
absurdity in Nothing's having existed from eter∣nity,
than there is in that succession of causes,
which constitutes the universe. What was it
then, which determined something to exist ra∣ther
than nothing, and bestowed being on a par∣ticular
possibility, exclusive of the rest? <HI>Exter∣nal
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
causes,</HI> there are supposed to be none.
<HI>Chance</HI> is a word without a meaning. Was it
<HI>Nothing?</HI> But that can never produce any
thing. We must, therefore, have recourse to a
necessarily-existent Being, who carries the REA∣SON
of his existence in himself; and who can∣not
be supposed not to exist without an express
contradiction. There is consequently such a Be∣ing,
that is, there is a Deity.</P>
<P>I shall not leave it to PHILO, said CLEAN∣THES,
(though I know that the starting objec∣tions
is his chief delight) to point out the weak∣ness
of this metaphysical reasoning. It seems to
me so obviously ill-grounded, and at the same
time of so little consequence to the cause of true
piety and religion, that I shall myself venture to
show the fallacy of it.</P>
<P>I shall begin with observing, that there is an
evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a
matter of fact, or to prove it by any arguments
<HI>a priori.</HI> Nothing is demonstrable, unless the
contrary implies a contradiction. Nothing, that
is distinctly conceivable, implies a contradiction.
Whatever we conceive as existent, we can also
conceive as non-existent. There is no being,
therefore, whose non-existence implies a contra∣diction.
Consequently there is no being, whose
existence is demonstrable. I propose this argu∣ment
as entirely decisive, and am willing to rest
the whole controversy upon it.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the Deity is a necessarily-existent
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
existent being; and this necessity of his exist∣ence
is attempted to be explained by asserting,
that, if we knew his whole essence or nature, we
should perceive it to be as impossible for him not
to exist as for twice two not to be four. But it
is evident, that this can never happen, while our
faculties remain the same as at present. It will
still be possible for us, at any time, to conceive
the non-existence of what we formerly conceived
to exist; nor can the mind ever lie under a ne∣cessity
of supposing any object to remain always
in being; in the same manner as we lie under a
necessity of always conceiving twice two to be
four. The words, therefore, <HI>necessary exist∣ence,</HI>
have no meaning; or, which is the same
thing, none that is consistent.</P>
<P>But farther; why may not the material uni∣verse
be the necessarily-existent Being, according
to this pretended explication of necessity? We
dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of
matter; and for aught we can determine, it may
contain some qualities, which, were they known,
would make its non-existence appear as great a
contradiction as that twice two is five. I find
only one argument employed to prove, that the
material world is not the necessarily-existent Be∣ing;
and this argument is derived from the con∣tingency
both of the matter and the form of the
world. <Q>Any particle of matter,</Q> 'tis said<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr Clarke.</NOTE>
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
<Q>may be <HI>conceived</HI> to be annihilated; and any
form may be <HI>conceived</HI> to be altered. Such
an annihilation or alteration, therefore, is not
impossible.</Q> But it seems a great partiality
not to perceive, that the same argument extends
equally to the Deity, so far as we have any con∣ception
of him; and that the mind can at least
imagine him to be non-existent, or his attributes
to be altered. It must be some unknown, in∣conceivable
qualities, which can make his non∣existence
appear impossible, or his attributes un∣alterable:
And no reason can be assigned, why
these qualities may not belong to matter. As
they are altogether unknown and inconceivable,
they can never be proved incompatible with it.</P>
<P>Add to this, that in tracing an eternal succes∣sion
of objects, it seems absurd to enquire for a
general cause or first author. How can any
thing, that exists from eternity, have a cause;
since that relation implies a priority in time and a
beginning of existence?</P>
<P>In such a chain too, or succession of objects,
each part is caused by that which preceded it,
and causes that which succeeds it. Where then
is the difficulty? But the WHOLE, you
say, wants a cause. I answer, that the uniting
of these parts into a whole, like the uniting of
several distinct counties into one kingdom, or
several distinct members into one body, is per∣formed
merely by an arbitrary act of the mind,
and has no influence on the nature of things.
Did I show you the particular causes of each in∣dividual
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
in a collection of twenty particles of
matter, I should think it very unreasonable, should
you afterwards ask me, what was the cause of
the whole twenty. That is sufficiently explained
in explaining the cause of the parts.</P>
<P>Though the reasonings, which you have urged,
CLEANTHES, may well excuse me, said PHILO,
from starting any farther difficulties; yet I can∣not
forbear insisting still upon another topic.
'Tis observed by arithmeticians, that the products
of 9 compose always either 9 or some lesser pro∣duct
of 9; if you add together all the characters,
of which any of the former products is composed.
Thus, of 18, 27, 36, which are products of 9,
you make 9 by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6.
Thus 369 is a product also of 9; and if you add
3, 6, and 9, you make 18, a lesser product of
9<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Republique des Lettres, Aout, 1685.</NOTE>. To a superficial observer, so wonderful a
regularity may be admired as the effect either of
chance or design; but a skilful algebraist imme∣diately
concludes it to be the work of necessity,
and demonstrates, that it must for ever result
from the nature of these numbers. Is it not pro∣bable,
I ask, that the whole oeconomy of the u∣niverse
is conducted by a like necessity, though
no human algebra can furnish a key, which solves
the difficulty? And instead of admiring the or∣der
of natural beings, may it not happen, that,
could we penetrate into the intimate nature of
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
bodies, we should clearly see why it was absolute∣ly
impossible, they could ever admit of any other
disposition? So dangerous is it to introduce this
idea of necessity into the present question! and
so naturally does it afford an inference directly
opposite to the religious hypothesis!</P>
<P>But dropping all these abstractions, continued
PHILO; and confining ourselves to more familiar
topics; I shall venture to add an observation,
that the argument <HI>a priori</HI> has seldom been found
very convincing, except to people of a metaphy∣sical
head, who have accustomed themselves to
abstract reasoning, and who finding from mathe∣matics,
that the understanding frequently leads
to truth, through obscurity, and contrary to first
appearances, have transferred the same habit of
thinking to subjects, where it ought not to have
place. Other people, even of good sense and
the best inclined to religion, feel always some de∣ficiency
in such arguments, though they are not
perhaps able to explain distinctly where it lies.
A certain proof, that men ever did, and ever
will derive their religion from other sources than
from this species of reasoning.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART X.</HEAD>
<P>IT is my opinion, I own, replied DEMEA,
that each man feels, in a manner, the truth of
religion within his own breast; and from a con∣sciousness
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
of his imbecility and misery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part. X.</NOTE> rather than
from any reasoning, is led to seek protection from
that Being, on whom he and all nature is de∣pendent.
So anxious or so tedious are even the
best seenes of life, that futurity is still the object
of all our hopes and fears. We incessantly look
forward, and endeavour, by prayers, adoration,
and sacrifice, to appease those unknown powers,
whom we find, by experience, so able to afflict
and oppress us. Wretched creatures that we are!
what resource for us amidst the innumerable ills
of life, did not Religion suggest some methods
of atonement, and appease those terrors, with
which we are incessantly agitated and tormented?</P>
<P>I am indeed persuaded, said PHILO, that the
best and indeed the only method of bringing e∣very
one to a due sense of religion, is by just re∣presentations
of the misery and wickedness of
men. And for that purpose a talent of eloquence
and strong imagery is more requisite than that of
reasoning and argument. For is it necessary to
prove, what every one feels within himself? 'Tis
only necessary to make us feel it, if possible,
more intimately and sensibly.</P>
<P>The people, indeed, replied DEMEA, are
sufficiently convinced of this great and melancholy
truth. The miseries of life, the unhappiness of
man, the general corruptions of our nature, the
unsatisfactory enjoyment of pleasures, riches, ho∣nours;
these phrases have become almost pro∣verbial
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
in all languages. And who can doubt of
what all men declare from their own immediate
feeling and experience?</P>
<P>In this point, said PHILO, the learned are
perfectly agreed with the vulgar; and in all let∣ters,
<HI>sacred</HI> and <HI>profane,</HI> the topic of human
misery has been insisted on with the most pathetic
eloquence, that sorrow and melancholy could
inspire. The poets, who speak from sentiment,
without a system, and whose testimony has there∣fore
the more authority, abound in images of this
nature. From HOMER down to Dr YOUNG,
the whole inspired tribe have ever been sensible,
that no other representation of things would
suit the feeling and observation of each indivi∣dual.</P>
<P>As to authorities, replied DEMEA, you need
not seek them. Look round this library of
CLEANTHES. I shall venture to affirm, that,
except authors of particular sciences, such as chy∣mistry
or botany, who have no occasion to treat
of human life, there is scarce one of those innu∣merable
writers, from whom the sense of human
misery has not, in some passage or other, extort∣ed
a complaint and confession of it. At least,
the chance is entirely on that side; and no one
author has ever, so far as I can recollect, been
so extravagant as to deny it.</P>
<P>There you must excuse me, said PHILO:
LEIBNITZ has denied it; and is perhaps the
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
first<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That sentiment had been maintained by Dr King and some few others before LEIBNITZ; though by none of so great fame as that GERMAN philosopher.</NOTE>, who ventured upon so bold and para∣doxical
an opinion; at least, the first, who made
it essential to his philosophical system.</P>
<P>And by being the first, replied DEMEA, might
he not have been sensible of his error? For is
this a subject, in which philosophers can propose
to make discoveries, especially in so late an age?
And can any man hope by a simple denial (for
the subject scarcely admits of reasoning) to bear
down the united testimony of mankind, founded
on sense and consciousness?</P>
<P>And why should man, added he, pretend to
an exemption from the lot of all other animals?
The whole earth, believe me, PHILO, is cursed
and polluted. A perpetual war is kindled a∣mongst
all living creatures. Necessity, hunger,
want, stimulate the strong and courageous: Fear,
anxiety, terror, agitate the weak and infirm.
The first entrance into life gives anguish to the
new-born infant and to its wretched parent:
Weakness, impotence, distress, attend each stage
of that life: and 'tis at last finished in agony and
horror.</P>
<P>Observe too, says PHILO, the curious artifices
of Nature, in order to imbitter the life of every
living being. The stronger prey upon the weaker,
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety.
The weaker too, in their turn, often prey upon
the stronger, and vex and molest them without
relaxation. Consider that innumerable race of
insects, which either are bred on the body of each
animal, or flying about infix their stings in him.
These insects have others still less than themselves,
which torment them. And thus on each hand,
before and behind, above and below, every ani∣mal
is surrounded with enemies, which incessantly
seek his misery and destruction.</P>
<P>Man alone, said DEMEA, seems to be, in part,
an exception to this rule. For by combination in
society, he can easily master lions, tygers, and
bears, whose greater strength and agility natural∣ly
enable them to prey upon him.</P>
<P>On the contrary, it is here chiefly, cried PHI∣LO,
that the uniform and equal maxims of Na∣ture
are most apparent. Man, it is true, can, by
combination, surmount all his <HI>real</HI> enemies, and
become master of the whole animal creation: but
does he not immediately raise up to himself <HI>ima∣ginary</HI>
enemies, the daemons of his fancy, who
haunt him with superstitious terrors, and blast e∣very
enjoyment of life? His pleasure, as he
imagines, becomes, in their eyes, a crime: his
food and repose give them umbrage and offence:
his very sleep and dreams furnish new materials
to anxious fear: and even death, his refuge
from every other ill, presents only the dread of
endless and innumerable woes. Nor does the
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
wolf molest more the timid flock, than supersti∣tion
does the anxious breast of wretched mortals.</P>
<P>Besides, consider, DEMEA; this very society, by
which we surmount those wild beasts, our natural
enemies; what new enemies does it not raise to
us? What woe and misery does it not occasion?
Man is the greatest enemy of man. Oppression,
injustice, contempt, contumely, violence, sedi∣tion,
war, calumny, treachery, fraud; by these
they mutually torment each other: and they
would soon dissolve that society which they had
formed, were it not for the dread of still greater
ills, which must attend their separation.</P>
<P>But though these external insults, said DEMEA,
from animals, from men, from all the elements,
which assault us, form a frightful catalogue of
woes, they are nothing in comparison of those,
which arise within ourselves, from the distemper∣ed
condition of our mind and body. How many
lie under the lingering torment of diseases? Hear
the pathetic enumeration of the great poet.</P>
<Q><L>Intestine stone and ulcer, colic-pangs,</L>
<L>Daemoniac frenzy, moping melancholy,</L>
<L>And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,</L>
<L>Marasmus and wide-wasting pestilence.</L>
<L>Dire was the tossing, deep the groans: DESPAIR</L>
<L>Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch.</L>
<L>And over them triumphant DEATH his dart</L>
<L>Shook, but delay'd to strike, tho' oft invok'd</L>
<L>With vows, as their chief good and final hope.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104"/>
The disorders of the mind, continued DEMEA,
though more secret, are not perhaps less dismal
and vexatious. Remorse, shame, anguish, rage,
disappointment, anxiety, fear, dejection, despair;
who has ever passed through life without cruel in∣roads
from these tormentors? How many have
scarcely ever felt any better sensations? Labour
and poverty, so abhorred by every one, are the
certain lot of the far greater number: and those
few privileged persons, who enjoy ease and opu∣lence,
never reach contentment or true felicity.
All the goods of life united would not make a
very happy man: but all the ills united would
make a wretch indeed; and any one of them al∣most
(and who can be free from every one) nay
often the absence of one good (and who can pos∣sess
all) is sufficient to render life ineligible.</P>
<P>Were a stranger to drop, on a sudden, into this
world, I would show him, as a specimen of its
ills, an hospital full of diseases, a prison crowded
with malefactors and debtors, a field of battle
strowed with carcases, a fleet foundering in the
ocean, a nation languishing under tyranny, fa∣mine,
or pestilence. To turn the gay side of life
to him, and give him a notion of its pleasures;
whither should I conduct him? to a ball, to an
opera, to court? He might justly think, that I
was only showing him a diversity of distress and
sorrow.</P>
<P>There is no evading such striking instances,
said PHILO, but by apologies, which still farther
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
aggravate the charge. Why have all men, I ask,
in all ages, complained incessantly of the miseries
of life?. — They have no just reason, says one:
these complaints proceed only from their discon∣tented,
repining, anxious disposition — And
can there possibly, I reply, be a more certain
foundation of misery, than such a wretched tem∣per?</P>
<P>But if they were really as unhappy as they pre∣tend,
says my antagonist, why do they remain in
life? —.</P>
<Q>Not satisfied with life, afraid of death.</Q>
<P>This is the secret chain, say I, that holds us. We
are terrified, not bribed to the continuance of our
existence.</P>
<P>It is only a false delicacy, he may insist, which
a few refined spirits indulge, and which has spread
these complaints among the whole race of man∣kind.
 — And what is this delicacy, I ask,
which you blame? Is it any thing but a greater
sensibility to all the pleasures and pains of life?
and if the man of a delicate, refined temper, by
being so much more alive than the rest of the
world, is only so much more unhappy; what
judgement must we form in general of human
life?</P>
<P>Let men remain at rest, says our adversary;
and they will be easy. They are willing artificers
of their own misery. — No! reply I; an an∣xious
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
languor follows their repose: disappoint∣ment,
vexation, trouble, their activity and ambi∣tion.</P>
<P>I can observe something like what you mention
in some others, replied CLEANTHES: but I con∣fess,
I feel little or nothing of it in myself; and
hope that it is not so common as you represent it.</P>
<P>If you feel not human misery yourself, cried
DEMEA, I congratulate you on so happy a singu∣larity.
Others, seemingly the most prosperous,
have not been ashamed to vent their complaints in
the most melancholy strains. Let us attend to the
great, the fortunate Emperor, CHARLES V,
when, tired with human grandeur, he resigned
all his extensive dominions into the hands of his
son. In the last harangue, which he made on
that memorable occasion, he publicly avowed,
<HI>that the greatest prosperities which he had e∣ver
enjoyed, had been mixed with so many ad∣versities,
that he might truly say he had never
enjoyed any satisfaction or contentment</HI> But
did the retired life, in which he sought for shelter,
afford him any greater happiness? If we may
credit his son's account, his repentance commen∣ced
the very day of his resignation.</P>
<P>CICERO's fortune, from small beginnings, rose
to the greatest lustre and renown; yet what pa∣thetic
complaints of the ills of life do his familiar
letters, as well as philosophical discourses, con∣tain?
And suitably to his own experience, he in∣troduces
CATO, the great, the fortunate CATO,
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
protesting in his old age, that, had he a new life
in his offer, he would reject the present.</P>
<P>Ask yourself, ask any of your acquaintance,
whether they would live over again the last ten or
twenty years of their life. No! but the next
twenty, they say, will be better:
<Q><L>And from the dregs of life, hope to receive</L>
<L>What the first sprightly running could not give.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus at last they find (such is the greatness of hu∣man
misery; it reconciles even contradictions)
that they complain, at once, of the shortness of
life, and of its vanity and sorrow.</P>
<P>And is it possible, CLEANTHES, said PHILO,
that after all these reflections, and infinitely more,
which might be suggested, you can still persevere
in your Anthropomorphism, and assert the moral
attributes of the Deity, his justice, benevolence,
mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature
with these virtues in human creatures? His
power we allow infinite: whatever he wills is exe∣cuted:
but neither man nor any other animal are
happy: therefore he does not will their happi∣ness.
His wisdom is infinite: he is never mista∣ken
in chusing the means to any end: but the
course of Nature tends not to human or animal
felicity: therefore it is not established for that
purpose. Through the whole compass of human
knowledge, there are no inferences more certain
and infallible than these. In what respect, then,
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
do his benevolence and mercy resemble the bene∣volence
and mercy of men?</P>
<P>EPICURUS's old questions are yet unanswered.</P>
<P>Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able?
then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing?
then is he malevolent. Is he both able and will∣ing?
whence then is evil?</P>
<P>You ascribe, CLEANTHES, (and I believe
justly) a purpose and intention to Nature. But
what, I beseech you, is the object of that curious
artifice and machinery, which she has displayed in
all animals? The preservation alone of individuals
and propagation of the species. It seems enough
for her purpose, if such a rank be barely upheld
in the universe, without any care or concern for
the happiness of the members, that compose it.
No resource for this purpose: no machinery, in
order merely to give pleasure or ease: no fund of
pure joy and contentment: no indulgence without
some want or necessity, accompanying it. At
least, the sew phenomena of this nature are over∣balanced
by opposite phenomena of still greater
importance.</P>
<P>Our sense of music, harmony, and indeed
beauty of all kinds gives satisfaction, without be∣ing
absolutely necessary to the preservation and
propagation of the species. But what racking
pains, on the other hand, arise from gouts, gra∣vels,
megrims, tooth-achs, rheumatisms; where
the injury to the animal-machinery is either small
or incurable? Mirth, laughter, play, frolic, seem
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
gratuitous satisfactions, which have no farther
tendency: spleen, melancholy, discontent, super∣stition,
are pains of the same nature. How then
does the divine benevolence display itself, in the
sense of you Anthropomorphites? None but
we Mystics, as you were pleased to call us, can
account for this strange mixture of phenomena,
by deriving it from attributes, infinitely perfect,
but incomprehensible.</P>
<P>And have you at last, said CLEANTHES smi∣ling,
betrayed your intentions, PHILO? Your
long agreement with DEMEA did indeed a little
surprise me; but I find you were all the while
crecting a concealed battery against me. And I
must confess, that you have now fallen upon a
subject, worthy of your noble spirit of opposition
and controversy. If you can make out the pre∣sent
point, and prove mankind to be unhappy or
corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion.
For to what purpose establish the natural attributes
of the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful
and uncertain?</P>
<P>You take umbrage very easily, replied DEMEA,
at opinions the most innocent, and the most ge∣nerally
received even amongst the religious and
devout themselves: and nothing can be more sur∣prising
than to find a topic like this, concerning
the wickedness and misery of man, charged with
no less than Atheism and profaneness. Have not
all pious divines and preachers, who have indul∣ged
their rhetoric on so fertile a subject; have
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
they not easily, I say, given a solution of any dif∣ficulties,
which may attend it? This world is but
a point in comparison of the universe: this life
but a moment in comparison of eternity. The
present evil phenomena, therefore, are rectified
in other regions, and in some future period of ex∣istence.
And the eyes of men, being then open∣ed
to larger views of things, see the whole con∣nection
of general laws, and trace, with adora∣tion,
the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity,
through all the mazes and intricacies of his provi∣dence.</P>
<P>No! replied CLEANTHES, No! These arbi∣trary
suppositions can never be admitted, con∣trary
to matter of fact, visible and uncontrovert∣ed.
Whence can any cause be known but from
its known effects? Whence can any hypothesis
be proved but from the apparent phenomena?
To establish one hypothesis upon another is build∣ing
entirely in the air; and the utmost we ever
attain, by these conjectures and fictions, is to
ascertain the bare possibility of our opinion; but
never can we, upon such terms, establish its
reality.</P>
<P>The only method of supporting divine bene∣volence
(and it is what I willingly embrace) is
to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness
of man. Your representations are exaggera∣ted:
Your melancholy views mostly fictitious:
Your inferences contrary to fact and experience.
Health is more common than sickness: Pleasure
than pain: Happiness than misery. And for one
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
vexation, which we meet with, we attain, upon
computation, a hundred enjoyments.</P>
<P>Admitting your position, replied PHILO, which
yet is extremely doubtful; you must, at the
same time, allow, that, if pain be less frequent
than pleasure, it is infinitely more violent and
durable. One hour of it is often able to out∣weigh
a day, a week, a month of our common
insipid enjoyments: And how many days, weeks,
and months are passed by several in the most a∣cute
torments? Pleasure, scarcely in one instance,
is ever able to reach ecstasy and rapture: And
in no one instance can it continue for any time
at its highest pitch and altitude. The spirits e∣vaporate;
the nerves relax; the fabric is disor∣dered;
and the enjoyment quickly degenerates
into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often,
good God, how often! rises to torture and a∣gony;
and the longer it continues, it becomes
still more genuine agony and torture. Patience
is exhausted; courage languishes; melancholy
seizes us; and nothing terminates our misery but
the removal of its cause, or another event, which
is the sole cure of all evil, but which, from our
natural folly, we regard with still greater horror
and consternation.</P>
<P>But not to insist upon these topics, continued
PHILO, though most obvious, certain, and im∣portant;
I must use the freedom to admonish
you, CLEANTHES, that you have put the con∣troversy
upon a most dangerous issue, and are,
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
unawares introducing a total Scepticism into the
most essential articles of natural and revealed the∣ology.
What! no method of fixing a just foun∣dation
for religion, unless we allow the happiness
of human life, and maintain a continued exist∣ence
even in this world, with all our present pains,
infirmities, vexations, and follies, to be eligible
and desireable! But this is contrary to every one's
feeling and experience: It is contrary to an au∣thority
so established as nothing can subvert:
No decisive proofs can ever be produced against
this authority; nor is it possible for you to com∣pute,
estimate, and compare all the pains and all
the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all a∣nimals:
And thus by your resting the whole sy∣stem
of religion on a point, which, from its very
nature, must for ever be uncertain, you tacitly
confess, that that system is equally uncertain.</P>
<P>But allowing you, what never will be be∣lieved;
at least, what you never possibly can
prove, that animal, or at least, human happiness
in this life exceeds its misery; you have yet done
nothing: For this is not, by any means, what
we expect from infinite power, infinite wisdom,
and infinite goodness. Why is there any misery
at all in the world? Not by chance surely. From
some cause then. Is it from the intention of the
Deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it
contrary to his intention? But he is almighty.
Nothing can shake the solidity of this reasoning,
so short, so clear, so decisive; except we assert,
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
that these subjects exceed all human capacity,
and that our common measures of truth and false∣hood
are not applicable to them; a topic, which
I have all along insisted on, but which you have,
from the beginning, rejected with scorn and in∣dignation.</P>
<P>But I will be contented to retire still from this
intrenchment: For I deny that you can ever force
me in it: I will allow, that pain or misery in man
is <HI>compatible</HI> with infinite power and goodness
in the Deity, even in your sense of these attri∣butes:
What are you advanced by all these con∣cessions?
A mere possible compatibility is not
sufficient. You must <HI>prove</HI> these pure, unmixt,
and uncontrollable attributes from the present
mixt and confused phenomena, and from these
alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the phe∣nomena
ever so pure and unmixt, yet being
finite, they would be insufficient for that pur∣pose.
How much more, where they are also so
jarring and discordant?</P>
<P>Here, CLEANTHES, I find myself at ease in
my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when
we argued concerning the natural attributes of
intelligence and design, I needed all my scepti∣cal
and metaphysical subtilty to elude your grasp.
In many views of the universe, and of its parts,
particularly the latter, the beauty and fitness of
final causes strike us with such irresistible force,
that all objections appear (what I believe they
really are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
we then imagine how it was ever possible for us
to repose any weight on them. But there is no
view of human life or of the condition of man∣kind,
from which, without the greatest violence,
we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that
infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power
and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by
the eyes of faith alone. It is your turn now to
tug the labouring oar, and to support your phi∣losophical
subtilties against the dictates of plain
reason and experience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART XI.</HEAD>
<P>I scruple not to allow, said CLEANTHES, that
I have been apt to suspect the frequent repetition
of the word, <HI>infinite,</HI> which we meet with in all
theological writers, to favour more of panegyric
than of philosophy, and that any purposes of
reasoning, and even of religion, would be better
served, were we to rest contented with more ac∣curate
and more moderate expressions. The
terms, <HI>admirable, excellent, superlatively great,
wise, and holy;</HI> these sufficiently fill the imagi∣nations
of men; and any thing beyond, besides
that it leads into absurdities, has no influence on
the affections or sentiments. Thus, in the pre∣sent
subject, if we abandon all human analogy,
as seems your intention, DEMEA, I am afraid
we abandon all religion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP="〈◊…〉"/> retain no concep∣tion
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
of the great object of our adoration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part XI.</NOTE> If we
preserve human analogy, we must for ever find
it impossible to reconcile any mixture of evil in
the universe with infinite attributes; much less,
can we ever prove the latter from the former.
But supposing the Author of Nature to be finite∣ly
perfect, though far exceeding mankind; a
satisfactory account may then be given of natural
and moral evil, and every untoward phenome∣non
be explained and adjusted. A less evil may
then be chosen, in order to avoid a greater: In∣conveniencies
be submitted to, in order to reach
a desirable end: And in a word, benevolence,
regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity,
may produce just such a world as the present.
You, PHILO, who are so prompt at starting
views, and reflections, and analogies; I would
gladly hear, at length, without interruption, your
opinion of this new theory; and if it deserve our
attention, we may afterwards, at more leisure,
reduce it into form.</P>
<P>My sentiments, replied PHILO, are not worth
being made a mystery of; and therefore, with∣out
any ceremony, I shall deliver what occurs to
me, with regard to the present subject. It must,
I think, be allowed, that, if a very limited intel∣ligence,
whom we shall suppose utterly unac∣quainted
with the universe, were assured, that it
were the production of a very good, wise, and
powerful being, however finite, he would, from
his conjectures, form <HI>beforehand</HI> a different
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
notion of it from what we find it to be by expe∣rience;
nor would he ever imagine, merely from
these attributes of the cause, of which he is in∣formed,
that the effect could be so full of vice
and misery and disorder, as it appears in this life.
Supposing now, that this person were brought
into the world, still assured, that it was the work∣manship
of such a sublime and benevolent Being;
he might, perhaps, be surprised at the disap∣pointment;
but would never retract his former
belief, if founded on any very solid argument;
since such a limited intelligence must be sensible
of his own blindness and ignorance, and must
allow, that there may be many solutions of those
phenomena, which will for ever escape his com∣prehension.
But supposing, which is the real
case with regard to man, that this creature is
not antecedently convinced of a supreme intelli∣gence,
benevolent, and powerful, but is left to
gather such a belief from the appearances of
things; this entirely alters the case, nor will he
ever find any reason for such a conclusion. He may
be fully convinced of the narrow limits of his
understanding; but this will not help him in
forming an inference concerning the goodness of
superior powers, since he must form that inference
from what he knows, not from what he is igno∣rant
of. The more you exaggerate his weakness
and ignorance, the more diffident you render
him, and give him the greater suspicion, that
such subjects are beyond the reach of his fa∣culties.
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
You are obliged, therefore, to reason
with him merely from the known phenomena,
and to drop every arbitrary supposition or con∣jecture.</P>
<P>Did I show you a house or palace, where
there was not one apartment convenient or agree∣able;
where the windows, doors, fires, passages,
stairs, and the whole oeconomy of the building
were the source of noise, confusion, fatigue, dark∣ness,
and the extremes of heat and cold; you
would certainly blame the contrivance, without
any farther examination. The architect would
in vain display his subtilty, and prove to you, that
if this door or that window were altered, great∣er
ills would ensue. What he says, may be
strictly true: The alternation of one particular,
while the other parts of the building remain, may
only augment the inconveniencies. But still you
would assert in general, that, if architect had
had skill and good intentions, he might have form∣ed
such a plan of the whole, and might have
adjusted the parts in such a manner, as would
have remedied all or most of these inconvenien∣cies.
His ignorance, or even your own igno∣rance
of such a plan, will never convince you of
the impossibility of it. If you find many incon∣veniencies
and deformities in the building, you
will always, without entering into any detail,
condemn the architect.</P>
<P>In short, I repeat the question: Is the world,
considered in general, and as it appears to us in
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
this life, different from what a man or such a li∣mited
Being would, <HI>beforehand,</HI> expect from
a very powerful, wise, and benevolent Deity?
It must be strange prejudice to assert the contrary.
And form thence I conclude, that, however con∣sistent
the world may be, allowing certain suppo∣sitions
and conjectures, with the idea of such a
Deity, it can never afford us an inference con∣cerning
his existence. The consistence is not
absolutely denied, only the inference. Conjec∣tures,
especially where infinity is excluded from
the divine attributes, may, perhaps, be sufficient
to prove a consistence; but can never be founda∣tions
for any inference.</P>
<P>There seem to be <HI>four</HI> circumstances, on
which depend all, or the greatest part of the ills,
that molest sensible creatures; and it is not impos∣sible
but all these circumstances may be necessary
and unavoidable. We know so little beyond
common life, or even of common life, that, with
regard to the oeconomy of a universe, there is no
conjecture, however wild, which may not be
just; nor any one, however plausible, which
may not be erroneous. All that belongs to hu∣man
understanding, in this deep ignorance and
obscurity, is to be sceptical, or at least cautious;
and not to admit of any hypothesis, whatever;
much less, of any which is supported by no ap∣pearance
of probability. Now this I assert to be
the case with regard to all the causes of evil, and
the circumstances, on which it depends. None
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
of them appear to human reason, in the least
degree, necessary or unavoidable; nor can we
suppose them such, without the utmost licence of
imagination.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> circumstance which introduces evil, is
that contrivance or oeconomy of the animal crea∣tion,
by which pains, as well as pleasures, are
employed to excite all creatures to action, and
make them vigilant in the great work of self-pre∣servation.
Now pleasure alone, in its various de∣grees,
seems to human understanding sufficient
for this prupose. All animals might be constantly
in a state of enjoyment; but when urged by any
of the necessities of nature, such as thirst, hun∣ger,
weariness; instead of pain, they might feel
a diminution of pleasure, by which they might be
prompted to seek that object, which is necessary
to their subsistence. Men pursue pleasure as ea∣gerly
as they avoid pain; at least, might have
been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly
possible to carry on the business of life without
any pain. Why then is any animal ever render∣ed
susceptible of such a sensation? If animals
can be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a
perpetual exemption from it; and it required as
particular a contrivance of their organs to produce
that feeling, as to endow them with sight, hear∣ing,
or any of the senses. Shall we conjecture,
that such a contrivance was necessary, without any
appearance of reason? and shall we build on that
conjecture as on the most certain truth?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="120"/>
But a capacity of pain would not alone pro∣duce
pain, were it not for the <HI>second</HI> circum∣stance,
<HI>viz.</HI> the conducting of the world by ge∣neral
laws; and this seems no wise necessary to a
very perfect being. It is true; if every thing
were conducted by particular volitions, the course
of nature would be perpetually broken, and no
man could employ his reason in the conduct of
life. But might not other particular volitions re∣medy
this inconvenience? In short, might not
the Deity exterminate all ill, where-ever it were
to be found; and produce all good, without any
preparation or long progress of causes and effects?</P>
<P>Besides, we must consider, that, according to
the present oeconomy of the world, the course of
Nature, though supposed exactly regular, yet to
us appears not so, and many events are uncertain,
and many disappoint our expectations. Health
and sickness, calm and tempest, with an infinite
number of other accidents, whose causes are un∣known
and variable, have a great influence both
on the fortunes of particular persons and on the
prosperity of public societies: and indeed all hu∣man
life, in a manner, depends on such acci∣dents.
A being, therefore, who knows the secret
springs of the universe, might easily, by particu∣lar
volitions, turn all these accidents to the good
of mankind, and render the whole world happy,
without discovering himself in any operation. A
fleet, whose purposes were salutary to society,
might always meet with a fair wind: Good princes
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
enjoy sound health and long life: Persons, born
to power and authority, be framed with good
tempers and virtuous dispositions. A few such
events as these, regularly and wisely conducted,
would change the face of the world; and yet
would no more seem to disturb the course of Na∣ture
or confound human conduct, than the pre∣sent
oeconomy of things, where the causes are se∣cret,
and variable, and compounded. Some
small touches, given to CALIGULA's brain in his
infancy, might have converted him into a TRA∣JAN:
one wave, a little higher than the rest, by
burying CAESAR and his fortune in the bottom of
the ocean, might have restored liberty to a consi∣derable
part of mankind. There may, for aught
we know, be good reasons, why Providence in∣terposes
not in this manner; but they are un∣known
to us: and though the mere supposition,
that such reasons exist, may be sufficient to <HI>save</HI>
the conclusion concerning the divine attributes,
yet surely it can never be sufficient to <HI>establish</HI>
that conclusion.</P>
<P>If every thing in the universe be conducted by
general laws, and if animals be rendered suscep∣tible
of pain, it scarcely seems possible but some ill
must arise in the various shocks of matter, and
the various concurrence and opposition of general
laws: But this ill would be very rare, were it not
for the <HI>third</HI> circumstance, which I proposed to
mention, <HI>viz.</HI> the great frugality, with which all
powers and faculties are distributed to every par∣ticular
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
being. So well adjusted are the organs
and capacities of all animals, and so well fitted to
their preservation, that, as far as history or tradi∣tion
reaches, there appears not to be any single
species, which has yet been extinguished in the u∣niverse.
Every animal has the requisite endow∣ments;
but these endowments are bestowed with
so scrupulous an oeconomy, that any consi∣derable
diminution must entirely destroy the crea∣ture.
Where-ever one power is encreased, there
is a proportional abatement in the others. Ani∣mals,
which excel in swiftness, are commonly de∣fective
in force. Those, which possess both, are
either imperfect in some of their senses, or are
oppressed with the most craving wants. The hu∣man
species, whose chief excellency is reason and
fagacity, is of all others the most necessitous, and
the most deficient in bodily advantages; without
cloaths, without arms, without food, without
lodging, without any convenience of life, except
what they owe to their own skill and industry. In
short, Nature seems to have formed an exact cal∣culation
of the necessities of her creatures; and
like a <HI>rigid master,</HI> has afforded them little more
powers or endowments, than what are strictly suf∣ficient
to supply those necessities. An <HI>indulgent
parent</HI> would have bestowed a large stock, in or∣der
to guard against accidents, and secure the
happiness and welfare of the creature, in the most
unfortunate concurrence of circumstances. Every
course of life would not have been so surrounded
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
with precipices, that the least departure from the
true path, by mistake or necessity, must involve
us in misery and ruin. Some reserve, some fund
would have been provided to ensure happiness;
nor would the powers and the necessities have
been adjusted with so rigid an oeconomy. The au∣thor
of Nature is inconceivably powerful: his
force is supposed great, if not altogether inexhaust∣ible:
nor is there any reason, as far as we can
judge, to make him observe this strict frugality
in his dealings with his creatures. It would have
been better, were his power extremely limited, to
have created fewer animals, and to have endowed
these with more faculties for their happiness and
preservation. A builder is never esteemed pru∣dent,
who undertakes a plan, beyond what his
stock will enable him to finish.</P>
<P>In order to cure most of the ills of human life,
I require not that man should have the wings of
the eagle, the swiftness of the stag, the force of
the ox, the arms of the lion, the scales of the
crocodile or rhinoceros; much lefs do I demand
the sagacity of an angel or cherubim. I am con∣tented
to take an encrease in one single power or
faculty of his soul. Let him be endowed with a
greater propensity to industry and labour; a more
vigorous spring and activity of mind; a more con∣stant
bent to business and application. Let the
whole species possess naturally an equal diligence
with that which many individuals are able to at∣tain
by habit and reflection; and the most bene∣ficial
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
consequences, without any allay of ill, is the
immediate and necessary result of this endowment.
Almost all the moral, as well as natural evils of
human life arise from idleness; and were our spe∣cies,
by the original constitution of their frame,
exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect
cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and
manufactures, the exact execution of every office
and duty, immediately follow; and men at once
may fully reach that state of society, which is so
imperfectly attained by the best-regulated govern∣ment.
But as industry is a power, and the most
valuable of any, Nature seems determined, suit∣ably
to her usual maxims, to bestow it on men
with a very sparing hand; and rather to punish
him severely for his deficiency in it, than to re∣ward
him for his attainments. She has so con∣trived
his frame, that nothing but the most vio∣lent
necessity can oblige him to labour; and she
employs all his other wants to overcome, at least
in part, the want of diligence, and to endow him
with some share of a faculty, of which she has
thought fit naturally to bereave him. Here our
demands may be allowed very humble, and there∣fore
the more reasonable. If we required the en∣dowments
of superior penetration and judgement,
of a more delicate taste of beauty, of a nicer
sensibility to benevolence and friendship; we
might be told, that we impiously pretend to break
the order of Nature, that we want to exalt our∣selves
into a higher rank of being, that the pre∣sents
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
which we require, not being suitable to our
state and condition, would only be pernicious to
us. But it is hard; I dare to repeat it, it is hard,
that being placed in a world so full of wants and
necessities; where almost every being and element
is either our foe or refuses its assistance — we
should also have our own temper to struggle with,
and should be deprived of that faculty, which can
alone fence against these multiplied evils.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> circumstance, whence arises the
misery and ill of the universe, is the inaccurate
workmanship of all the springs and principles of
the great machine of nature. It must be acknow∣ledged,
that there are few parts of the uni∣verse,
which seem not to serve some purpose, and
whose removal would not produce a visible defect
and disorder in the whole. The parts hang all to∣gether;
nor can one be touched without affecting
the rest, in a greater or less degree. But at the
same time, it must be observed, that none of
these parts or principles, however useful, are so
accurately adjusted, as to keep precisely within
those bounds, in which their utility consists; but
they are, all of them, apt, on every occasion, to
run into the one extreme or the other. One
would imagine, that this grand production had
not received the last hand of the maker; so little
finished is every part, and so coarse are the
strokes, with which it is executed. Thus, the
winds are requisite to convey the vapours along
the surface of the globe, and to assist men in na∣vigation:
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
but how oft, rising up to tempests and
hurricanes, do they become pernicious? Rains
are necessary to nourish all the plants and animals
of the earth: but how often are they defective?
how often excessive? Heat is requisite to all life
and vegetation; but is not always found in the
due proportion. On the mixture and secretion
of the humours and juices of the body depend the
health and prosperity of the animal: but the parts
perform not regularly their proper function. What
more useful than all the passions of the mind, am∣bition,
vanity, love, anger? But how oft do
they break their bounds, and cause the greatest
convulsions in society? There is nothing so ad∣vantageous
in the universe, but what frequently
becomes pernicious, by its excess or defect; nor
has Nature guarded, with the requisite accuracy,
against all disorder or confusion. The irregulari∣ty
is never, perhaps, so great as to destroy any
species; but is often sufficient to involve the indi∣viduals
in ruin and misery.</P>
<P>On the concurrence, then, of these <HI>four</HI> cir∣cumstances
does all, or the greatest part of natu∣ral
evil depend. Were all living creatures inca∣pable
of pain, or were the world administered by
particular volitions, evil never could have found
access into the universe: and were animals en∣dowed
with a large stock of powers and faculties,
beyond what strict necessity requires; or were the
several springs and principles of the universe so
accurately framed as to preserve always the just
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
temperament and medium; there must have been
very little ill in comparison of what we feel at pre∣sent.
What then shall we pronounce on this oc∣casion?
Shall we say, that these circumstances
are not necessary, and that they might easily have
been altered in the contrivance of the universe?
This decision seems too presumptuous for crea∣tures,
so blind and ignorant. Let us be more
modest in our conclusions. Let us allow, that, if
the goodness of the Deity (I mean a goodness like
the human) could be established on any tolerable
reasons <HI>a priori,</HI> these phenomena, however un∣toward,
would not be sufficient to subvert that
principle; but might easily, in some unknown
manner, be reconcilable to it. But let us still as∣sert,
that as this goodness is not antecedently e∣stablished,
but must be inferred from the pheno∣mena,
there can be no grounds for such an infer∣ence,
while there are so many ills in the universe,
and while these ills might so easily have been re∣medied,
as far as human understanding can be
allowed to judge on such a subject. I am Sceptic
enough to allow, that the bad appearances, not∣withstanding
all my reasonings, may be compati∣ble
with such attributes as you suppose: But sure∣ly
they can never prove these attributes. Such a
conclusion cannot result from Scepticism; but
must arise from the phenomena, and from our
confidence in the reasonings, which we deduce
from these phenomena.</P>
<P>Look round this universe. What an immense
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
profusion of beings, animated and organized,
fensible and active! You admire this prodigious
variety and fecundity. But inspect a little more
narrowly these living existences, the only beings
worth regarding. How hostile and destructive to
each other! How insufficient all of them for
their own happiness! How contemptible or o∣dious
to the spectator! The whole presents no∣thing
but the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated
by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth
from her lap, without discernment or parental
care, her maimed and abortive children.</P>
<P>Here the MANICHAEAN system occurs as a pro∣per
hypothesis to solve the difficulty: and no
doubt, in some respects, it is very specious, and
has more probability than the common hypothesis,
by giving a plausible account of the strange mix∣ture
of good and ill, which appears in life. But
if we consider, on the other hand, the perfect
uniformity and agreement of the parts of the u∣niverse,
we shall not discover in it any marks of
the combat of a malevolent with a benevolent be∣ing.
There is indeed an opposition of pains and
pleasures in the feelings of sensible creatures: but
are not all the operations of Nature carried on by
an opposition of principles, of hot and cold, moist
and dry, light and heavy? The true conclusion
is, that the original source of all things is entirely
indifferent to all these principles, and has no more
regard to good above ill than to heat above cold,
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
or to drought above moisture, or to light above
heavy.</P>
<P>There may <HI>four</HI> hypotheses be framed concern∣ing
the first causes of the universe; <HI>that</HI> they are
endowed with perfect goodness, <HI>that</HI> they have
perfect malice, <HI>that</HI> they are opposite and have
both goodness and malice, <HI>that</HI> they have neither
goodness nor malice. Mixt phenomena can ne∣ver
prove the two former unmixt principles,
And the uniformity and steadiness of general
laws seems to oppose the third. The fourth, there∣fore,
seems by far the most probable.</P>
<P>What I have said concerning natural evil will
apply to moral, with little or no variation; and
we have no more reason to infer, that the recti∣tude
of the supreme Being resembles human rec∣titude
than that his benevolence resembles the hu∣man.
Nay, it will be thought, that we have still
greater cause to exclude from him moral senti∣ments,
such as we feel them; since moral evil,
in the opinion of many, is much more predomi∣nant
above moral good than natural evil above na∣tural
good.</P>
<P>But even though this should not be allowed,
and though the virtue, which is in mankind,
should be acknowledged much superior to the
vice; yet so long as there is any vice at all in
the universe, it will very much puzzle you An∣thropomorphites,
how to account for it. You
must assign a cause for it, without having recourse
to the first cause. But as every effect must have
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
a cause, and that cause another; you must either
carry on the progression <HI>in infinitum,</HI> or rest on
that original principle, who is the ultimate cause
of all things —</P>
<P>Hold! Hold! cried DEMEA: Whither does
your imagination hurry you? I joined in alliance
with you, in order to prove the incomprehensible
nature of the divine Being, and refute the prin∣ciples
of CLEANTHES, who would measure e∣very
thing by a human rule and standard. But
I now find you running into all the topics of the
greatest libertines and infidels; and betraying
that holy cause, which you seemingly espoused.
Are you secretly, then, a more dangerous enemy
than CLEANTHES himself?</P>
<P>And are you so late in perceiving it? replied CLE∣ANTHES.
Believe me, DEMEA; your friend PHI∣LO,
from the beginning, has been amusing him∣self
at both our expence; and it must be con∣fessed,
that the injudicious reasoning of our vul∣gar
theology has given him but too just a handle
of ridicule. The total infirmity of human reason,
the absolute incomprehensibility of the Divine
Nature, the great and universal misery and still
greater wickedness of men; these are strange to∣pics
surely to be so fondly cherished by orthodox
divines and doctors. In ages of stupidity and
ignorance, indeed, these principles may safely
be espoused; and perhaps, no views of things
are more proper to promote superstition, than
such as encourage the blind amazement, the dif∣fidence,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
and melancholy of mankind. But at
present. —</P>
<P>Blame not so much, interposed PHILO, the
ignorance of these reverend gentlemen. They
know how to change their style with the times.
Formerly it was a most popular theological topic
to maintain, that human life was vanity and mi∣sery,
and to exaggerate all the ills and pains,
which are incident to men. But of late years,
divines, we find, begin to retract this position,
and maintain, though still with some hesitation,
that there are more goods than evils, more plea∣sures
than pains, even in this life. When reli∣gion
stood entirely upon temper and education,
it was thought proper to encourage melancholy;
as indeed, mankind never have recourse to supe∣rior
powers so readily as in that disposition. But
as men have now learned to form principles, and
to draw consequences, it is necessary to change
the batteries, and to make use of such arguments
as will endure, at least some scrutiny and exami∣nation.
This variation is the same (and from
the same causes) with that which I formerly re∣marked
with regard to Scepticism.</P>
<P>Thus PHILO continued to the last his spirit of
opposition, and his censure of established opinions.
But I could observe, that DEMEA did not at all
relish the latter part of the discourse; and he
took occasion soon after, on some pretence or
other, to leave the company.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="part">

<HEAD>PART XII.</HEAD>
<P>After DEMEA's departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part XII.</NOTE> CLEANTHES
and PHILO continued the conversation in the fol∣lowing
manner. Our friend, I am afraid, said
CLEANTHES, will have little inclination to re∣vive
this topic of discourse, while you are in com∣pany;
and to tell truth, PHILO, I should rather
wish to reason with either of you apart on a sub∣ject,
so sublime and interesting. Your spirit of
controversy, joined to your abhorrence of vulgar
superstition, carries you strange lengths, when
engaged in an argument; and there is nothing
so sacred and venerable, even in your own eyes,
which you spare on that occasion.</P>
<P>I must confess, replied PHILO, that I am less
cautious on the subject of Natural Religion than
on any other; both because I know that I can
never, on that head, corrupt the principles of
any man of common sense, and because no one,
I am confident, in whose eyes I appear a man of
common sense, will ever mistake my intentions.
You in particular, CLEANTHES, with whom I
live in unreserved intimacy; you are sensible,
that, notwithstanding the freedom of my conver∣sation,
and my love of singular arguments, no
one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on
his mind, or pays more profound adoration to
the divine Being, as he discovers himself to rea∣son,
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice
of Nature. A purpose, an intention, a design
strikes every where the most careless, the most
stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened
in absurd systems, as at all times to reject it.
<HI>That Nature does nothing in vain,</HI> is a maxim
established in all the schools, merely from the
contemplation of the works of Nature, without
any religious purpose; and, from a firm convic∣tion
of its truth, an anatomist, who had observed
a new organ or canal, would never be satisfied,
till he had also discovered its use and intention.
One great foundation of the COPERNICAN sy∣stem
is the maxim, <HI>That Nature acts by the
simplest methods, and chuses the most proper
means to any end;</HI> and astronomers often, with∣out
thinking of it, lay this strong foundation of
piety and religion. The same thing is observable
in other parts of philosophy: And thus all the
sciences almost lead us insensibly to acknowledge
a first intelligent Author; and their authority is
often so much the greater, as they do not di∣rectly
profess that intention.</P>
<P>It is with pleasure I hear GALEN reason con∣cerning
the structure of the human body. The
anatomy of a man, says he<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De formatione foetus.</NOTE>, discovers above
600 different muscles; and whoever duly con∣siders
these, will find, that in each of them Na∣ture
must have adjusted at least ten different cir∣cumstances,
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
in order to attain the end which she
proposed; proper figure, just magnitude, right
disposition of the several ends, upper and lower
position of the whole, the due insertion of the
several nerves, veins, and arteries: So that in
the muscles alone, above 6000 several views and
intentions must have been formed and executed.
The bones he calculates to be 284: The distinct
purposes, aimed at in the structure of each, a∣bove
forty. What a prodigious display of arti∣fice,
even in these simple and homogeneous
parts? But if we consider the skin, ligaments,
vessels, glandules, humours, the several limbs
and members of the body; how must our asto∣nishment
rise upon us, in proportion to the num∣ber
and intricacy of the parts so artificially ad∣justed?
The farther we advance in these re∣searches,
we discover new scenes of art and wis∣dom:
But descry still, at a distance, farther
scenes beyond our reach; in the fine internal
structure of the parts, in the oeconomy of the
brain, in the fabric of the seminal vessels. All
these artifices are repeated in every different spe∣cies
of animal, with wonderful variety, and with
exact propriety, suited to the different intentions
of Nature, in framing each species. And if the
infidelity of GALEN, even when these natural
sciences were still imperfect, could not with∣stand
such striking appearances; to what pitch
of pertinacious obstinacy must a philosopher in
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
this age have attained, who can now doubt of a
Supreme Intelligence?</P>
<P>Could I meet with one of this species (who, I
thank God, are very rare) I would ask him:
Supposing there were a God, who did not dis∣cover
himself immediately to our senses; were
it possible for him to give stronger proofs of his
existence, than what appear on the whole face
of Nature? What indeed could such a divine
Being do, but copy the present oeconomy of
things; render many of his artifices so plain,
that no stupidity could mistake them; afford
glimpses of still greater artifices, which demon∣strate
his prodigious superiority above our nar∣row
apprehensions; and conceal altogether a great
many from such imperfect creatures? Now ac∣cording
to all rules of just reasoning, every fact
must pass for undisputed, when it is supported by
all the arguments, which its nature admits of;
even though these arguments be not, in them∣selves,
very numerous or forcible: How much
more, in the present case, where no human ima∣gination
can compute their number, and no un∣derstanding
estimate their cogency?</P>
<P>I shall farther add, said CLEANTHES, to what
you have so well urged, that one great advantage of
the principle of Theism, is, that it is the only system
of cosmogony, which can be rendered intelligible
and complete, and yet can throughout preserve a
strong analogy to what we every day see and ex∣perience
in the world. The comparison of the
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
universe to a machine of human contrivance is so
obvious and natural, and is justified by so many
instances of order and design in Nature, that it
must immediately strike all unprejudiced appre∣hensions,
and procure universal approbation.
Whoever attempts to weaken this theory, can∣not
pretend to succeed by establishing in its place
any other, that is precise and determinate: It is
sufficient for him, if he start doubts and difficul∣ties;
and by remote and abstract views of things,
reach that suspense of judgement, which is here
the utmost boundary of his wishes. But besides,
that this state of mind is in itself unsatisfactory,
it can never be steadily maintained against such
striking appearances, as continually engage us
into the religious hypothesis. A false, absurd sy∣stem,
human nature, from the force of prejudice,
is capable of adhering to, with obstinacy and per∣severance:
But no system at all, in opposition to
a theory, supported by strong and obvious rea∣son,
by natural propensity, and by early educa∣tion,
I think it absolutely impossible to maintain
or defend.</P>
<P>So little, replied PHILO, do I esteem this sus∣pense
of judgement in the present case to be pos∣sible,
that I am apt to suspect there enters some∣what
of a dispute of words into this controversy,
more than is usually imagined. That the works
of Nature bear a great analogy to the productions
of art is evident; and according to all the rules
of good reasoning, we ought to infer, if we ar∣gue
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
at all concerning them, that their causes have
a proportional analogy. But as there are also
considerable differences, we have reason to sup∣pose
a proportional difference in the causes; and
in particular ought to attribute a much higher
degree of power and energy to the supreme cause
than any we have ever observed in mankind.
Here then the existence of a DEITY is plainly
ascertained by reason; and if we make it a que∣stion,
whether, on account of these analogies,
we can properly call him a <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>intelligence,</HI>
notwithstanding the vast difference, which may
reasonably be supposed between him and human
minds; what is this but a mere verbal controver∣sy?
No man can deny the analogies between
the effects: To restrain ourselves from enquiring
concerning the causes is scarcely possible: From
this enquiry, the legitimate conclusion is, that
the causes have also an analogy: And if we are
not contented with calling the first and supreme
cause a GOD or DEITY, but desire to vary
the exprèssion; what can we call him but MIND
or THOUGHT, to which he is justly suppo∣sed
to bear a considerable resemblance?</P>
<P>All men of sound reason are disgusted with
verbal disputes, which abound so much in philo∣sophical
and theological enquiries; and it is found,
that the only remedy for this abuse must arise
from clear definitions, from the precision of those
ideas which enter into any argument, and from
the strict and uniform use of those terms which
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
are employed. But there is a species of contro∣versy,
which, from the very nature of language
and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual am∣biguity,
and can never, by any precaution or
any definitions, be able to reach a reasonable
certainty or precision. These are the controver∣sies
concerning the degrees of any quality or cir∣cumstance.
Men may argue to all eternity, whe∣ther
HANNIBAL be a great, or a very great, or a
superlatively great man, what degree of beauty
CLEOPATRA possessed, what epithet of praise LI∣VY
or THUCIDYDES is intitled to, without bring∣ing
the controversy to any determination. The dis∣putants
may here agree in their sense, and differ in
the terms, or <HI>vice versa;</HI> yet never be able to
define their terms, so as to enter into each others
meaning: Because the degrees of these qualities
are not, like quantity or number, susceptible of
any exact mensuration, which may be the stand∣ard
in the controversy. That the dispute con∣cerning
Theism is of this nature, and consequent∣ly
is merely verbal, or perhaps, if possible, still
more incurably ambiguous, will appear upon the
slightest enquiry. I ask the Theist, if he does
not allow, that there is a great and immeasurable,
because incomprehensible, difference between the
<HI>human</HI> and the <HI>divine</HI> mind: The more pious
he is, the more readily will he assent to the affir∣mative,
and the more will he be disposed to mag∣nify
the difference: He will even assert, that the
difference is of a nature which cannot be too
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
much magnified. I next turn to the Atheist,
who, I assert, is only nominally so, and can ne∣ver
possibly be in earnest; and I ask him, whe∣ther,
from the coherence and apparent sympathy
in all the parts of this world, there be not a cer∣tain
degree of analogy among all the operations
of Nature, in every situation and in every age;
whether the rotting of a turnip, the generation of
an animal, and the structure of human thought
be not energies that probably bear some remote
analogy to each other: It is impossible he can
deny it: He will readily acknowledge it. Ha∣ving
obtained this concession, I push him still
farther in his retreat; and I ask him, if it be not
probable, that the principle which first arranged,
and still maintains order in this universe, bears
not also some remote inconceivable analogy to
the other operations of Nature, and among
the rest to the oeconomy of human mind and
thought. However reluctant, he must give his
assent. Where then, cry I to both these anta∣gonists,
is the subject of your dispute? The Theist
allows, that the original intelligence is very dif∣ferent
from human reason: The Atheist allows,
that the original principle of order bears some
remote analogy to it. Will you quarrel, Gen∣tlemen,
about the degrees, and enter into a con∣troversy,
which admits not of any precise mean∣ing,
nor consequently of any determination? If
you should be so obstinate, I should not to be
surprised to find you insensibly change sides;
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
while the Theist on the one hand exaggerates the
dissimilarity between the Supreme Being, and
frail, imperfect, variable, fleeting, and mortal
creatures; and the Atheist on the other magni∣fies
the analogy among all the operations of
Nature, in every period, every situation, and e∣very
position. Consider then, where the real
point of controversy lies, and if you cannot lay a∣side
your disputes, endeavour, at least, to cure
yourselves of your animosity.</P>
<P>And here I must also acknowledge, CLEAN∣THES,
that, as the works of Nature have a much
greater analogy to the effects of <HI>our</HI> art and con∣trivance,
than to those of <HI>our</HI> benevolence and
justice; we have reason to infer that the natural
attributes of the Deity have a greater resemblance
to those of man, than his moral have to human
virtues. But what is the consequence? Nothing
but this, that the moral qualities of man are
more defective in their kind than his natural
abilities. For as the Supreme Being is allowed
to be absolutely and entirely perfect, whatever
differs most from him departs the farthest from
the supreme standard of rectitude and perfec∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems evident, that the dispute between the Sceptics and Dogmatists is entirely verbal, or at least regards only the degrees of doubt and assurance, which we ought to indulge with regard to all reasoning: And such disputes are commonly, at the bottom, verbal, and admit not of any precise determination. No phi∣losophical Dogmatist denies, that there are difficulties both with regard to the senses and to all science; and that these difficulties are in a regular, logical method, absolutely insolveable. No Sceptic denies, that we lie under an absolute necessity, notwithstanding these dif∣ficulties, of thinking, and believing, and reasoning with regard to all kind of subjects, and even of frequently assenting with confidence and security. The only differ∣ence, then, between these sects, if they merit that name, is, that the Sceptic, from habit, caprice, or in∣clination, insists most on the difficulties; the Dogmatist, for like reasons, on the necessity.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141"/>
These, CLEANTHES, are my unfeigned senti∣ments
on this subject; and these sentiments, you
know, I have ever cherished and maintained.
But in proportion to my veneration for true re∣ligion,
is my abhorrence of vulgar superstitions;
and I indulge a peculiar pleasure, I confess, in
pushing such principles, sometimes into absurdity,
sometimes into impiety. And you are sensible,
that all bigots, notwithstanding their great aver∣sion
to the latter above the former, are common∣ly
equally guilty of both.</P>
<P>My inclination, replied CLEANTHES, lies, I
own, a contrary way. Religion, however cor∣rupted,
is still better than no religion at all. The
doctrine of a future state is so strong and neces∣sary
a security to morals, that we never ought to
abandon or neglect it. For if finite and tempo∣rary
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
rewards and punishments have so great an
effect, as we daily find; how much greater must
be expected from such as are infinite and eter∣nal?</P>
<P>How happens it then, said PHILO, if vulgar
superstition be so salutary to society, that all hi∣story
abounds so much with accounts of its per∣nicious
consequences on public assairs? Factions,
civil wars, persecutions, subversions of govern∣ment,
oppression, slavery; these are the dismal
consequences which always attend its prevalency
over the minds of men. If the religious spirit
be ever mentioned in any historical narration, we
are sure to meet afterwards with a detail of the
miseries, which attend it. And no period of time
can be happier or more prosperous, than those
in which it is never regarded, or heard of.</P>
<P>The reason of this observation, replied CLE∣ANTHES,
is obvious. The proper office of re∣ligion
is to regulate the heart of men, humanize
their conduct, infuse the spirit of temperance,
order, and obedience; and as its operation is
silent, and only enforces the motives of morality
and justice, it is in danger of being overlooked,
and confounded with these other motives. When
it distinguishes itself, and acts as a separate prin∣ciple
over men, it has departed from its proper
sphere, and has become only a cover to faction
and ambition.</P>
<P>And so will all religion, said PHILO, except
the philosophical and rational kind. Your rea∣sonings
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
are more easily eluded than my facts.
The inference is not just, because finite and tempo∣rary
rewards and punishments have so great in∣fluence,
that therefore such as are infinite and e∣ternal
must have so much greater. Consider, I
beseech you, the attachment, which we have to
present things, and the little concern which we dis∣cover
for objects, so remote and uncertain. When
divines are declaiming against the common beha∣viour
and conduct of the world, they always re∣present
this principle as the strongest imaginable
(which indeed it is) and describe almost all hu∣man
kind as lying under the influence of it, and
sunk into the deepest lethargy and unconcern a∣bout
their religious interests. Yet these same di∣vines,
when they refute their speculative antago∣nists,
suppose the motives of religion to be so
powerful, that, without them, it were impossible
for civil society to subsist; nor are they ashamed
of so palpable a contradiction. It is certain, from
experience, that the smallest grain of natural ho∣nesty
and benevolence has more effect on mens
conduct, than the most pompous views, suggested
by theological theories and systems. A man's na∣tural
inclination works incessantly upon him; it is
for ever present to the mind; and mingles itself
with every view and consideration: whereas reli∣gious
motives, where they act at all, operate on∣ly
by starts and bounds; and it is scarcely pos∣sible
for them to become altogether habitual to
the mind. The force of the greatest gravity, say
the philosephers, is infinitely small, in comparison
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
of that of the least impulse; yet it is certain, that
the smallest gravity will, in the end, prevail above
a great impulse; because no strokes or blows can
be repeated with such constancy as attraction and
gravitation.</P>
<P>Another advantage of inclination: It engages
on its side all the wit and ingenuity of the mind;
and when set in opposition to religious principles,
seeks every method and art of eluding them:
In which it is almost always successful. Who
can explain the heart of man, or account for
those strange salvos and excuses, with which
people satisfy themselves, when they follow their
inclinations, in opposition to their religious duty?
This is well understood in the world; and none
but fools ever repose less trust in a man, because
they hear, that, from study and philosophy, he
has entertained some speculative doubts with re∣gard
to theological subjects. And when we have
to do with a man, who makes a great profession
of religion and devotion; has this any other ef∣fect
upon several, who pass for prudent, than to
put them on their guard, lest they be cheated
and deceived by him?</P>
<P>We must farther consider, that philosophers,
who cultivate reason and reflection, stand less in
need of such motives to keep them under the re∣straint
of morals: and that the vulgar, who alone
may need them, are utterly incapable of so pure
a religion, as represents the Deity to be plea∣sed
with nothing but virtue in human behaviour.
The recommendations to the Divinity are general∣ly
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
supposed to be either frivolous observances, or
rapturous ecstasies, or a bigotted credulity. We
need not run back into antiquity, or wander into
remote regions, to find instances of this degene∣racy.
Amongst ourselves, some have been guilty
of that atrociousness, unknown to the EGYPTIAN
and GRECIAN superstitions, of declaiming, in ex∣press
terms, against morality, and representing it
as a sure forfeiture of the divine favour, if the
least trust or reliance be laid upon it.</P>
<P>But even though superstition or enthusiasm
should not put itself in direct opposition to mora∣lity;
the very diverting of the attention, the rai∣sing
up a new and frivolous species of merit, the
preposterous distribution, which it makes of praise
and blame; must have the most pernicious conse∣quences,
and weaken extremely mens attach∣ment
to the natural motives of justice and huma∣nity.</P>
<P>Such a principle of action likewise, not being
any of the familiar motives of human conduct,
acts only by intervals on the temper, and must be
rouzed by continual efforts, in order to render
the pious zealot satisfied with his own conduct,
and make him fulfil his devotional task. Many
religious exercises are entered into with seeming
fervour, where the heart, at the time, feels cold
and languid: A habit of dissimulation is by de∣grees
contracted: and fraud and falsehood be∣come
the predominant principle. Hence the rea∣son
of that vulgar observation, that the highest
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
zeal in religion and the deepest hypocrisy, so far
from being inconsistent, are often or commonly
united in the same individual character.</P>
<P>The bad effects of such habits, even in com∣mon
life, are easily imagined: but where the in∣terests
of religion are concerned, no morality can
be forcible enough to bind the enthusiastic zealot.
The sacredness of the cause sanctifies every mea∣sure,
which can be made use of to promote it.</P>
<P>The steady attention alone to so important an in∣terest
as that of eternal salvation is apt to extin∣guish
the benevolent affections, and beget a nar∣row,
contracted selfishness. And when such a
temper is encouraged, it easily eludes all the ge∣neral
precepts of charity and benevolence.</P>
<P>Thus the motives of vulgar superstition have no
great influence on general conduct; nor is their
operation very favourable to morality, in the in∣stances,
where they predominate.</P>
<P>Is there any maxim in politics more certain and
infallible, than that both the number and autho∣rity
of priests should be confined within very nar∣row
limits, and that the civil magistrate ought,
for ever, to keep his <HI>fasces</HI> and <HI>axes</HI> from such
dangerous hands? But if the spirit of popular
religion were so salutary to society, a contrary
maxim ought to prevail. The greater number of
priests, and their greater authority and riches will al∣ways
augment the religious spirit. And though the
priests have the guidance of this spirit, why may
we not expect a superior sanctity of life, and
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
greater benevolence and moderation, from per∣sons
who are set apart for religion, who are con∣tinually
inculcating it upon others, and who must
themselves imbibe a greater share of it? Whence
comes it then, that in fact, the utmost a wise ma∣gistrate
can propose with regard to popular reli∣gions,
is, as far as possible, to make a saving
game of it, and to prevent their pernicious con∣sequences
with regard to society. Every expe∣dient
which he tries for so humble a purpose is
surrounded with inconveniencies. If he admits
only one religion among his subjects, he must sa∣crifice,
to an uncertain prospect of tranquillity,
every consideration of public liberty, science, rea∣son,
industry, and even his own independency.
If he gives indulgence to several sects, which is
the wiser maxim, he must preserve a very philoso∣phical
indifference to all of them, and carefully
restrain the pretensions of the prevailing sect; o∣therwise
he can expect nothing but endless dis∣putes,
quarrels, factions, persecutions, and civil
commotions.</P>
<P>True religion, I allow, has no such pernicious
consequences: but we must treat of religion, as
it has commonly been found in the world; nor
have I any thing to do with that speculative tenet
of Theism, which, as it is a species of philosophy,
must partake of the beneficial influence of that
principle, and at the same time must lie under a
like inconvenience, of being always confined to
very few persons.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="148"/>
Oaths are requisite in all courts of judicature;
but it is a question whether their authority arises
from any popular religion. 'Tis the solemnity and
importance of the occasion, the regard to re∣putation,
and the reflecting on the general inter∣ests
of society, which are the chief restraints up∣on
mankind. Custom-house oaths and political
oaths are but little regarded even by some who
pretend to principles of honesty and religion: and
a Quaker's asseveration is with us justly put upon
the same footing with the oath of any other per∣son.
I know, that POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 54.</NOTE> ascribes the in∣famy
of GREEK faith to the prevalency of the
EPICUREAN philosophy; but I know also, that
PUNIC faith had as bad a reputation in ancient
times, as IRISH evidence has in modern; though
we cannot account for these vulgar observations by
the same reason. Not to mention, that GREEK
faith was infamous before the rise of the EPICU∣REAN
philosophy; and EURIPIDES<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iphigenia in Tauride.</NOTE>, in a pas∣sage
which I shall point out to you, has glanced a
remarkable stroke of satire against his nation,
with regard to this circumstance.</P>
<P>Take care, PHILO, replied CLEANTHES, take
care: push not matters too far: allow not your
zeal against false religion to undermine your vene∣ration
for the true. Forfeit not this principle, the
chief, the only great comfort in life; and our
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
principal support amidst all the attacks of adverse
fortune. The most agreeable reflection, which
it is possible for human imagination to suggest, is
that of genuine Theism, which represents us as
the workmanship of a Being perfectly good, wise,
and powerful; who created us for happiness, and
who, having implanted in us immeasureable de∣sires
of good, will prolong our existence to all e∣ternity,
and will transfer us into an infinite varie∣ty
of scenes, in order to satisfy those desires, and
render our felicity compleat and durable. Next
to such a Being himself (if the comparison be al∣lowed)
the happiest lot which we can imagine, is
that of being under his guardianship and protec∣tion.</P>
<P>These appearances, said PHILO, are most en∣gaging
and alluring; and with regard to the true
philosopher, they are more than appearances. But
it happens here, as in the former case, that, with
regard to the greater part of mankind, the ap∣pearances
are deceitful, and that the terrors of re∣ligion
commonly prevail above its comforts.</P>
<P>It is allowed, that men never have recourse to
devotion so readily as when dejected with grief or
depressed with sickness. Is not this a proof, that
the religious spirit is not so nearly allied to joy
as to sorrow?</P>
<P>But men, when afflicted, find consolation in re∣ligion,
replied CLEANTHES. Sometimes, said
PHILO: but it is natural to imagine, that they
will form a notion of those unknown beings, suit∣ably
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
to the present gloom and melancholy of their
temper, when they betake themselves to the con∣templation
of them. Accordingly, we find the
tremendous images to predominate in all reli∣gions;
and we ourselves, after having employed
the most exalted expression in our descriptions of
the Deity, fall into the flattest contradiction, in af∣firming,
that the damned are infinitely superior
in number to the elect.</P>
<P>I shall venture to affirm, that there never was a
popular religion, which represented the state of
departed souls in such a light, as would render it
eligible for human kind, that there should be such
a state. These fine models of religion are the
mere product of philosophy. For as death lies
between the eye and the prospect of futurity, that
event is so shocking to Nature, that it must throw
a gloom on all the regions, which lie beyond it;
and suggest to the generality of mankind the idea
of CERBERUS and furies; devils, and torrents of
fire and brimstone.</P>
<P>It is true; both fear and hope enter into reli∣gion;
because both these passions, at different
times, agitate the human mind, and each of them
forms a species of divinity, suitable to itself. But
when a man is in a chearful disposition, he is fit
for business or company or entertainment of any
kind; and he naturally applies himself to these,
and thinks not of religion. When melancholy,
and dejected, he has nothing to do but brood up∣on
the terrors of the invisible world, and to
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
plunge himself still deeper in affliction. It may,
indeed, happen, that after he has, in this manner,
ingraved the religious opinions deep into his
thought and imagination, there may arrive a
change of health or circumstances, which may
restore his good humour, and raising chearful pro∣spects
of futurity, make him run into the other
extreme of joy and triumph. But still it must be
acknowledged, that, as terror is the primary
principle of religion, it is the passion, which al∣ways
predominates in it, and admits but of short
intervals of pleasure.</P>
<P>Not to mention, that these fits of excessive,
enthusiastic joy, by exhausting the spirits, always
prepare the way for equal fits of superstitious ter∣ror
and dejection; nor is there any state of mind
so happy as the calm and equable. But this state,
it is impossible to support, where a man thinks,
that he lies, in such profound darkness and un∣certainty,
between an eternity of happiness and an
eternity of misery. No wonder, that such an o∣pinion
disjoints the ordinary frame of the mind,
and throws it into the utmost confusion. And
though that opinion is seldom so steady in its ope∣ration
as to influence all the actions; yet is it apt
to make a considerable breach in the temper, and
to produce that gloom and melancholy, so remark∣able
in all devout people.</P>
<P>It is contrary to common sense to entertain ap∣prehensions
or terrors, upon account of any opi∣nion
whatsoever, or to imagine that we run any
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
risk hereafter, by the freest use of our reason.
Such a sentiment implies both an <HI>absurdity</HI> and
an <HI>inconsistency.</HI> It is an absurdity to believe that
the Deity has human passions, and one of the lowest
of human passions, a restless appetite for applause.
It is an inconsistency to believe, that, since the
Deity has this human passion, he has not others
also; and in particular, a disregard to the opi∣nions
of creatures, so much inferior.</P>
<P><HI>To know God,</HI> says SENECA, <HI>is to worship
him.</HI> All other worship is indeed absurd, su∣perstitious,
and even impious. It degrades him
to the low condition of mankind, who are de∣lighted
with intreaty, solicitation, presents, and
slattery. Yet is this impiety the smallest of which
superstition is guilty. Commonly, it depresses
the Deity far below the condition of mankind;
and represents him as a capricious daemon, who
exercises his power without reason and without
humanity! And were that divine Being disposed
to be offended at the vices and follies of silly
mortals, who are his own workmanship; ill would
it surely fare with the votaries of most popular
superstitions. Nor would any of human race me∣rit
his <HI>favor,</HI> but a very few, the philosophical
Theists, who entertain, or rather indeed endea∣vour
to entertain, suitable notions of his divine
perfections: As the only persons, intitled to his
<HI>compassion</HI> and <HI>indulgence,</HI> would be the philoso∣phical
Sceptics, a sect almost equally rare, who,
from a natural diffidence of their own capacity,
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
suspend, or endeavour to suspend all judgement
with regard to such sublime and such extraordinary
subjects.</P>
<P>If the whole of Natural Theology, as some
people seem to maintain, resolves itself into one
simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least
undefined proposition, <HI>That the cause or causes
of order in the universe probably bear some
remote analogy to human intelligence:</HI> If this
proposition be not capable of extension, variation,
or more particular explication: If it affords no
inference that affects human life, or can be the
source of any action or forbearance: And if the
analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no
farther than to the human intelligence; and
cannot be transferred, with any appearance of
probability, to the other qualities of the mind:
If this really be the case, what can the most in∣quisitive,
contemplative, and religious man do
more than give a plain, philosophical assent to
the proposition, as often as it occurs; and be∣lieve
that the arguments, on which it is establish∣ed,
exceed the objections, which lie against it?
Some astonishment indeed will naturally arise
from the greatness of the object: Some melan∣choly
from its obscurity: Some contempt of hu∣man
reason, that it can give no solution more
satisfactory with regard to so extraordinary and
magnificent a question. But believe me, CLE∣ANTHES,
the most natural sentiment, which a
well-disposed mind will feel on this occasion, is
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
a longing desire and expectation, that heaven
would be pleased to dissipate, at least alleviate
this profound ignorance, by affording some more
particular revelation to mankind, and making dis∣coveries
of the nature, attributes, and operations
of the divine object of our faith. A person, sea∣soned
with a just sense of the imperfections of
natural reason, will fly to revealed truth with the
greatest avidity: While the haughty Dogmatist,
persuaded, that he can erect a complete system
of Theology by the mere help of philosophy,
disdains any farther aid, and rejects this adven∣titious
instructor. To be a philosophical Sceptic
is, in a man of letters, the first and most essen∣tial
step towards being a sound, believing Chri∣stian;
a proposition, which I would willingly re∣commend
to the attention of PAMPHILUS: And
I hope CLEANTHES will forgive me for interpo∣sing
so far in the education and instruction of his
pupil.</P>
<P>CLEANTHES and PHILO pursued not this con∣versation
much farther; and as nothing ever
made greater impression on me, than all the rea∣sonings
of that day; so, I confess, that, upon a
serious review of the whole, I cannot but think,
that PHILO's principles are more probable than
DEMEA's; but that those of CLEANTHES ap∣proach
still nearer to the truth.</P>
