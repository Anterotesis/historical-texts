<HEAD>A Commendatory
SERMON
Preach'd <HI>November</HI> the 4th, 1709.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 Chap. 2 Book of Samuel, 24.</BIBL>
<Q>Ye Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who cloathed
you in Scarlet, with other Delights; who put on
ornaments of Gold upon your Apparrel.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOW, Gentlemen, you will pardon me a
Digression, when I shall remind you that
this is the 4th Day of <HI>November,</HI> the initial Day
of <HI>Euroupe</HI>'s Liberty, the great Dawning of this
Age's Glory; the Day that God has hallow'd or
set apart to be praised in, for that unvalued Bles∣sing
of King <HI>William</HI>'s Life. On this Day it be∣gan.
The Thankfulness of honest Men for the in∣estimable
Gift, shall never fail to be revived this
Day, while they have Hearts to own it, or <HI>Britain</HI>
has honest Men left to know the Hand that saved
them, or to remember whose glorius Instrument
he was, to assault Tyranny, and the most trium∣phant
Enemies of God's Church, and his People's
Liberty.</P>
<P>May this Day be Sacred to his Memory, <HI>and it</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
<HI>will be so,</HI> while there are any such thing as honest
Men in this Part of the World— The Reflection
upon the least temporal Mercy ye enjoy, <HI>ay and
some spiritual ones too,</HI> must bring back your Me∣mory
to <HI>this Day,</HI> and by this Day to the Person
by whose Name 'tis call'd I know 'tis hard, as a
Reverend Prelate of this Church once took notice,
<HI>for English Men to remember Twenty long Years be∣hind
them, especially so dispised a thing as a Bene∣fector</HI>
But an <HI>English</HI> Man cannot look round him
a Day in his Life, but he is as necessarily brought
to a Remembrance of King <HI>William.</HI> I had almost
said, as he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of a Governing Providence in the
World. Nor is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any thing prophane to joyn them;
For by Him, as Instrument, has Providence brought
to pass for us all the Wonders of the last Age—An
Age big with mighty Events, swell'd with the glo∣rious
Revolutions of Kingdoms, and the mighty
Downfall of Hell's monstrous Schemes, laid deep,
and politickly derected at the Interest and King∣dom
of Christ Jesus in the World.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was the Thunderbolt that split all the
mighty Work, that blow up the Foundation of the
Devil's Kingdom in <HI>Europe</HI>; that shook the vast
Fabrick, and left it so weak, that even a Wo∣man
is thought on, Can an English Man go to Bed,
or rise up, without blessing the very Name of
King <HI>William</HI>? His Perils have been our Safety,
his Labours our Ease, his Cares our Comfort, his
continued Harassing and Fatigue, our continued
Calm and Tranquility.</P>
<P>When you sit down to eat why have you not
Soldiers quarter'd in your Houses to command
your Servants and insult your Tables? 'Tis because
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<HI>King William</HI> subjected the Military to the Civil
Authority, and made the Sword of Justice triumph
over the Sword of War, When you lye down at
Night why do you not bolt and bar your Chamber,
to defend the Chastity of your Wives and Daugh∣ters
from the ungovern'd Lust of raging Mercen∣aries?
'Tis because <HI>King William</HI> restored the Sove∣reignty
and Dominion of the Laws, and made the
Red-Coat World Servants to those that paid them.
When you receive your Rents, why are not arbitary
Defalcations made upon your Tennants, arbitary
Imposts laid upon your Commerce, and oppressive
Taxes levied upon your Estates, to support the
Tyranny that demands them, and your Bondage
made strong at your Expence? 'Tis because <HI>King
William</HI> re-establish'd the essential Security of your
Properties, and put you into that happy Condition
which few Nations enjoy, of calling your Souls
your own. How came you by a Parliament to bal∣lence
between the Governed and the Governing,
but upon King <HI>William</HI>'s exalting Liberty upon the
ruin of the Oppression? How came you to have
Power to abuse your Deliverer, but by the very
Deliverance he wrought for you? He gave you that
Liberty you afterwards took to insult him, and sup∣ported
you in those very Priviledges you ungrate∣fully
bullied him with. You could not with all
your brutish skill provoke him to be a Tyrant,
He abhorr'd Oppression, and scorn'd to practise it,
and he that had Fire enough to assault all your
Oppressors, and a Hand strong enough to wrestle
with an establish'd and confirm'd Tyrant, had yet
Meekness enough to let you oppress him, because
he would not oppress you, and saw you ungrateful
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
enough to oppose not your Benefactor only, but
your own Felicity for his sake.</P>
<P>Yet to the last he fought for you against foreign
Tyranny, and kept his Foot upon the Neck of
your secret Usurpers; He trod upon them. And
those than courted him at Home to resent your In∣gratitude,
received his constant Frown; This was
the Man that liv'd for you, and yet died by you,
and hearken to it with Regret, and reproach your
selves with it whilst you live, He died murther'd
by your Unkindness.</P>
<P>Heaven, that honour'd him here, and receiv'd
him from hence, has shown some dreadful Instances
of his Abhorrence of the Manner he was treated
here, and has resented the particular Insults done
to his Name, as if done to himself; And I wish
I could not say, Heaven seems to punish us Nati∣onally
for our National Usage of this Prince, who
was his eminent Instrument to us for Good.</P>
<P>How are we, notwithstanding our Victories, yet
embarrass'd in that cruel and bloody War, which
we reproach'd him for not ending sooner? We
have not yet arriv'd to that Partition-Treaty, that
we threw in his Face, And if greater Conditions
have been seemingly offer'd us, they have been but
seemingly so, without any Security for their being
made effectual. We have had Reason now to see
our Reproaches of King <HI>William</HI> unjust, who we
redicul'd for not beating the <HI>French,</HI> while he has
rather harden'd himself this Year, than submitted,
after he has been five Times overthrown.</P>
<P>Let us look back to King <HI>William</HI>'s Part in this War,
and imagine <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in the state he was in when
that War began. Not all the Princes and States of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
united, would have begun a War against him. His
Armies numerous in Men, and all those Men veterans
in War, and flush'd with Conquest; his Treasures in a
Kind infinite, his Generals experienc'd and enterpri∣zing;
himself 20 years younger and vigorous. I tell
ye none of ye all would have ventur'd to begin the
War, nor would you have been in your Wits, if you
had. It was a Work only fit for a <HI>William,</HI> a King that
could conquer by being overthrown, that could strug∣gle
with Impossibilities, and could penetrate into the
remotest Events.</P>
<P>Let any Man look into the Temper of our Nation at
this time, and they will find we are not now fit for a
Disaster, as we were then; we have fought the <HI>French,</HI>
and beaten them, thank God for it; for Woe to us if we
had lost the Day! How would our Credit have been
run down, our Bank being push'd at, our General in∣sulted,
our Ministry abus'd, as if really Men were now
in God's stead.</P>
<P>And that the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> could not only fight
for Victory, but command it, But King <HI>William</HI> saw
Victory even in the want of Success; He lost the Bat∣tles,
and won the Day, and in this I am not too for∣ward,
if I say, he fought as never Man fought and con∣quer'd▪
He fought with a fierce victorious Enemy abroad,
with cruel and intolerable Deficiences at Home, and
yet he fought! Any body but King <HI>William</HI> would have
yielded to insuperable Difficulties, but he fought on,
and reduc'd the King of <HI>France</HI> at last, to seek Peace,
acknowledge him King, and affront the Refugee that
he fought to restore.</P>
<P>Thus he broke the first Power of the invincible
<HI>French</HI> Empire; He broke their old Veterans, and ex∣hausted
their immense Treasures; He took the haugh∣ty
<HI>Lewis</HI> by the Throat in the flower of his Strength,
and set his Foot against him, when he was another kind
of <HI>Ltwis</HI> than he is now. And tho' I would not lessen
the Glory of the present Conquerors in the Field, yet as
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
a Mine under a great Rock, tho' it cannot entirely
blow it away, yet shakes it, and dislocates it, so as to
make it easier for Workmen to remove; So King <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
shook the Foundations of <HI>French</HI> Power in such a
manner, as has made it much easier for others to crush
it entirely, than it would otherwise have been.</P>
<P>At last Heaven, provok'd at your Treatment of this
Prince, removed him from us, and were it not a Debt
due to his Memory, I should bury in silence the barba∣rous
Abuses of him after his Decease; but particularly
the Article of the Horse. The King was thrown by his
Horse, or rather his Horse fell with him, by which his
Majesty received some hurt in his Collar-Bone, which
as it was thought hastned his Death, tho, it is evident
he did not die of that Hurt.</P>
<P>Now let them not only blush, but tremble at the E∣vent,
who have insulted his Memory, by cannonizing
in their Cups the Horse that threw down the King,
drinking a Health to the Beast, less so by far than the
Bruits that drink it, and rejoycing in the Disaster. Let
such no more talk of Calves Head Clubs and Feasts of
Triumph, tho' vile enough too, insulting the Dead; but
nothing can match the Infamy of this Practice, odious
both to God and Man. How odious it is to Man, I
think I need not insist upon; no honest Man can think
of it without Horror; But how odious to God it is,
you shall all be judge.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, pray remark it, to the Honour of
Divine Vengeance, and to the extraordinary Convicti∣on
of all that can open their Eyes to the Methods of the
Almighty, in his examplar Dealings with impious Men;
That of the scandalous Wretches, who have thus insult∣ed
the Memory of King <HI>William</HI> in this Nation, by
drinking the Horse's Health that hurt him. I can give
you Account of at least Eleven, that have had their
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
Brains dash'd out, or their Necks broke, by falls from
their Horses; Besides some that have been very much
hurt, but have had Time spar'd to them for Repentance,
And if ye think it for your Instruction, I may hereafter
give you their several Histories. Pray mark the Retali∣ation,
I say it again, All by falls from their Horses.</P>
<P>Can we have have a greater Testimomy of the abhord
Wickedness of the Thing? Has Heaven, in any Age,
given a greater Witness to the Honour or Memory of
any Man in the World? You may read plainly, how
dear his Name is to the Divine Power, who concerns
his Justice so remarkably to retaliate the Injuries done
it. That the Party, who espouse these People, may
read their Crime in their Punishment. Let the Rem∣nant
take heed,</P>
<P>Now Joy and Pleasant Hearts be your Portion, who
commemorate this Day, that Drink a Temporate Glass
to the Prosperity of all that love <HI>King William</HI>: that bless
his Memory, and hand on a grateful Sence of his A∣ctions
to the Ages to come. And may all that envy and
repine at his Glory, or at the great Things we enjoy
from his Conduct, be disragarded and disappointed, till
they repent, or do worse.</P>
