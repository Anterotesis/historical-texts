<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT Of the French Editors.</HEAD>
<P>THE name and writings of Mr. Hume
have been long since well known
throughout Europe. At the same time, his
personal acquaintance have remarked, in
the candour and simplicity of his manners,
that impartiality and ingenuousness of dis∣position
which distinguishes his character,
and is sufficiently indicated in his writings.</P>
<P>He hath exerted those great talents he re∣ceived
from nature, and the acquisitions he
made by study, in the search of truth, and
promoting the good of mankind: never
wasting his time, or sacrificing his repose,
in literary or personal disputes. He hath
seen his writings frequently censured with
bitterness, by fanaticism, ignorance, and the
spirit of party, without ever giving an an∣swer
to his adversaries.</P>
<P>Even those who have attacked his works
with the greatest violence, have always re∣spected
his personal character. His love of
peace is so well known, that the criticisms
written against his pieces, have been often
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
brought him by their respective authors, for
him to revise and correct them. At one time,
in particular, a performance of this kind was
shewn to him; in which he had been treat∣ed
in a very rude and even injurious manner;
on remarking which to the author, the latter
struck out the exceptionable passages; blush∣ing,
and wondering at the force of that <HI>polemic
spirit</HI> which had carried him imperceptibly
away beyond the bounds of truth and decency.</P>
<P>It was with great reluctance that a man,
possessed of such pacific dispositions, could
be brought to consent to the publication of
the following piece. He was very sensible
that the quarrels among men of letters are
a scandal to philosophy; nor was any person
in the world less formed for giving occasion
to a scandal, so consolatory to blockheads.
But the circumstances were such as to draw
him into it, in spite of his inclinations.</P>
<P>All the world knows that Mr. Rousseau,
proscribed in almost every country where he
resided, determined at length to take re∣fuge
in England; and that Mr. Hume, af∣fected
by his situation, and his misfortunes,
undertook to bring him over, and to pro∣vide
for him a peaceful, safe, and conve∣nient
alylum. But very few persons are
privy to the zeal, activity, and even deli∣cacy,
with which Mr. Hume conferred this
act of benevolence; what an affectionate
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
attachment he had contracted for this new
friend, which humanity had given him;
with what address he endeavoured to anti∣cipate
his desires, without offending his
pride; in short, with what address he strove
to justify, in the eyes of others, the singu∣larities
of Mr. Rousseau, and to defend his
character against those who were not dis∣posed
to think so favourably of him as he
did himself.</P>
<P>Even at the time when Mr. Hume was
employed in doing Mr. Rousseau the most
essential service, he received from him the
most insolent and abusive letter. The more
such a stroke was unexpected, the more
it was cruel and affecting. Mr. Hume wrote
an account of this extraordinary adventure
to his friends at Paris; and expressed him∣self
in his letters with all that indignation
which so strange a proceeding must excite.
He thought himself under no obligation to
keep terms with a man, who, after having
received from him the most certain and con∣stant
marks of friendship, could reproach
him, without any reason, as false, treache∣rous,
and as the most wicked of mankind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the dispute between
these two celebrated personages did not fail
to make a noise. The complaints of Mr.
Hume soon came to the knowlege of the
public; which at first hardly believed it pos∣sible
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
that Mr. Rousseau could be guilty of
that excessive ingratitude laid to his charge.
Even Mr. Hume's friends were fearful, lest,
in the first effusions of sensibility, he was
not carried too far, and had not mistaken
for wilful crimes of the heart, the vagaries
of the imagination, or the deceptions of the
understanding. He judged it necessary,
therefore, to explain the affair, by writing
a precise narrative of all that passed between
him and Mr. Rousseau, from their first
connection to their rupture. This narrative
he sent to his friends; some of whom ad∣vised
him to print it; alledging, that as Mr.
Rousseau's accusations were become public,
the proofs of his justification ought to be so
too. Mr. Hume did not give into these ar∣guments,
choosing rather to run the risk of
being unjustly censured, than to resolve on
making himself a public party in an affair,
so contrary to his disposition and character.
A new incident, however, at length over∣came
his reluctance. Mr. Rousseau had ad∣dressed
a letter to a bookseller at Paris; in
which he directly accuses Mr. Hume of
having entered into a league with his ene∣mies,
to betray and defame him; and in
which he boldly defies Mr. Hume to print
the papers he had in his hands. This letter
was communicated to several persons in Pa∣ris,
was translated into English, and the
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
translation printed in the public papers in
London. An accusation and defiance so
very public could not be suffered to pass
without reply; while any long silence on
the part of Mr. Hume might have been in∣terpreted
little in his favour.</P>
<P>Besides, the news of this dispute had
spread itself over Europe, and the opinions
entertained of it were various. It had
doubtless been much happier, if the whole
affair had been buried in oblivion, and re∣mained
a profound secret: but as it was im∣possible
to prevent the public interesting it∣self
in the controversy, it became necessary
at least that the truth of the matter should
be known. Mr. Hume's friends unitedly
represented to him all these reasons; the
force of which he was at length convinced
of; and seeing the necessity, consented,
though with reluctance, to the printing of
his memorial.</P>
<P>The narrative, and notes, are translated
from the English<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And are now re-translated, for the most part, from the French; the French editors having taken some li∣berties, not without Mr. Hume's consent, with the English original. <BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. The letters of Mr.
Rousseau, which serve as authentic proofs of
the facts, are exact copies of the originals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the present edition Mr. Hume's letters are printed <HI>verbatim</HI>; and to Mr. Rousseau's the translator hath endeavoured to do justice, as well with regard to the sense as the expression. Not that he can flatter himself with having always succeeded in the latter. He has taken the liberty also to add a note or two, regard∣ing some particular circumstances which had come to his knowlege.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
This pamphlet contains many strange in∣stances
of singularity, that will appear ex∣traordinary
enough to those who will give
themselves the trouble to peruse it. Those
who do not chuse to take that trouble, how∣ever,
may possibly do better; as its contents
are of little importance, except to those who
are immediately interested.</P>
<P>On the whole, Mr. Hume, in offering to
the public the genuine pieces of his trial,
has authorised us to declare, that he will ne∣ver
take up the pen again on the subject.
Mr. Rousseau indeed may return to the
charge; he may produce suppositions, mis∣constructions,
inferences, and new declama∣tions;
he may create and realize new phan∣toms,
and envelop them in the clouds of his
rhetoric; he will meet with no more con∣tradiction.
The facts are all laid before the
public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original letters of both parties will be lodged in the British Museum; on account of the above men∣tioned defiance of Mr. Rousseau, and his subsequent insinuation that if they should be published, they would be falsified.</NOTE>: and Mr. Hume submits his cause
to the determination of every man of sense
and probity.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
CONTROVERSY
BETWEEN
Mr. HUME and Mr. ROUSSEAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>August 1, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY connection with Mr. Rousseau be∣gan
in 1762, when the Parliament
of Paris had issued an arret for apprehending
him, on account of his <HI>Emilius.</HI> I was at
that time at Edinburgh. A person of great
worth wrote to me from Paris, that Mr.
Rousseau intended to seek an asylum in
England, and desired I would do him all the
good offices in my power. As I conceived
Mr. Rousseau had actually put his design in
execution, I wrote to several of my friends
in London, recommending this celebrated
exile to their favour. I wrote also imme∣diately
to Mr. Rousseau himself; assuring
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
him of my desire to oblige, and readiness to
serve him. At the same time, I invited him
to come to Edinburgh, if the situation would
be agreeable, and offered him a retreat in
my own house, so long as he should please
to partake of it. There needed no other
motive to excite me to this act of humanity,
than the idea given me of Mr. Rousseau's
personal character, by the friend who had
recommended him, his well-known genius
and abilities, and above all, his misfortunes;
the very cause of which was an additional
reason to interest me in his favour. The
following is the answer I received.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Mr. ROUSSEAU to Mr. HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Motiers-Travers, <DATE>Feb. 19, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not receive till lately, and at this
place, the letter you did me the ho∣nour
to direct to me at London, the 2d of
July last, on the supposition that I was then
arrived at that capital. I should doubtless
have made choice of a retreat in your coun∣try,
and as near as possible to yourself, if I
had foreseen what a reception I was to meet
with in my own. No other nation could
claim a preference to England. And this
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
prepossession, for which I have dearly suf∣fered,
was at that time too natural not to
be very excusable; but to my great astonish∣ment,
as well as that of the public, I have met
with nothing but affronts and insults, where
I hoped to have found consolation at least, if
not gratitude. How many reasons have I not
to regret the want of that asylum and philo∣sophical
hospitality I should have found with
you! My misfortunes indeed have con∣stantly
seemed to lead me in a manner that
way. The protection and kindness of my
Lord Marshal, your worthy and illustrious
countryman, hath brought Scotland home
to me, if I may so express myself, in the
midst of Switzerland; he hath made you
so often bear a part in our conversation,
hath brought me so well acquainted with
your virtues, which I before was only with
your talents, that he inspired me with the
most tender friendship for you, and the most
ardent desire of obtaining yours, before I
even knew you were disposed to grant it.
Judge then of the pleasure I seel, at finding
this inclination reciprocal. No, Sir, I
should pay your merit but half its due, if
it were the subject only of my admiration.
Your great impartiallty, together with your
amazing penetration and genius, would lift
you far above the rest of mankind, if you
were less attached to them by the goodness
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
of your heart. My Lord Marshal, in ac∣quainting
me that the amiableness of your
disposition was still greater than the subli∣mity
of your genius, rendered a correspond∣ence
with you every day more desirable,
and cherished in me those wishes which
he inspired, of ending my days near you.
Oh, Sir, that a better state of health, and
more convenient circumstances, would but
enable me to take such a journey in the
manner I could like! Could I but hope to
see you and my Lord Marshal one day settled
in your own country; which should for ever
after be mine; I should be thankful, in such
a society, for the very misfortunes that led
me into it, and should account the day of
its commencement as the first of my life.
Would to Heaven I might live to see that
happy day, though now more to be desired
than expected! With what transports should
I not exclaim, on setting foot in that happy
country which gave birth to David Hume
and the Lord Marshal of Scotland!</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter is not published from a motive
of vanity; as will be seen presently, when
I give the reader a recantation of all the eu∣logies
it contains; but only to compleat the
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
course of our correspondence, and to shew
that I have been long since disposed to Mr.
Rousseau's service.</P>
<P>From this time our correspondence en∣tirely
ceased, till about the middle of last
autumn (1765;) when it was renewed by
the following accident. A certain lady of
Mr. Rousseau's acquaintance, being on a
journey to one of the French provinces,
bordering on Switzerland, had taken that
opportunity of paying a visit to our solitary
philosopher, in his retreat at Motiers-Tra∣vers.
To this lady he complained, that his
situation in Newschatel was become ex∣tremely
disagreeable, as well on account of
the superstition of the people, as the resent∣ment
of the clergy; and that he was afraid
he should shortly be under the necessity of
seeking an asylum elsewhere; in which case,
England appeared to him, from the nature
of its laws and government, to be the only
place to which he could retire with perfect
security; adding, that my Lord Marshal,
his former protector, had advised him to
put himself under my protection (that was
the term he was pleased to make use of)
and that he would accordingly address him∣self
to me, if he thought it would not be
giving me too much trouble.</P>
<P>I was at that time charged with the af∣fairs
of England at the court of France;
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
but as I had the prospect of soon returning
to London, I could not reject a proposal
made to me under such circumstances, by a
man so celebrated for his genius and misfor∣tunes.
As soon as I was thus informed,
therefore, of the situation and intentions of
Mr. Rousseau, I wrote to him, making him
an offer of my services; to which he re∣turned
the following answer.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">

<P>YOUR goodness affects me as much
as it does me honour. The best reply
I can make to your offers is to accept them,
which I do. I shall set out in five or six
days to throw myself into your arms. Such
is the advice of my Lord Marshal, my pro∣tector,

of Madam * * *<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The person here mentioned desired her name might be suppressed. <HI>French Editor.</HI></P>

benevolence serve equally for my direction
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
and consolation; in fine, I may say it is the
advice of my own heart, which takes a
pleasure in being indebted to the most illu∣strious
of my contemporaries, to a man
whose goodness surpasses his glory. I sigh
after a solitary and free retirement, wherein
I might finish my days in peace. If this be
procured me by means of your benevolent
solicitude, I shall then enjoy at once the plea∣sure
of the only blessing my heart desires, and
also that of being indebted for it to you. I

<P>Not that I had deferred till this time my
endeavours to be useful to Mr. Rousseau.
The following letter was communicated to
me by Mr. Clairaut, some weeks before his
death.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Mr. ROUSSEAU to Mr. CLAIRAUT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Motiers-Travers, <DATE>March 3, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE remembrance of your former
kindness, induces me to be again im∣portunate.
It is to desire you will be so good,
for the second time, to be the censor of one of
my performances. It is a very paltry rhap∣sody,
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
which I compiled many years ago,
under the title of <HI>A Musical Dictionary,</HI> and
am now obliged to republish it for susistence.
Amidst the torrent of misfortunes that over-whelm
me, I am not in a situation to review
the work; which, I know, is full of over∣sights
and mistakes. If any interest you
may take in the lot of the most unfortunate
of mankind, should induce you to bestow a
little more attention on his work than on
that of another, I should be extremely obli∣ged
to you, if you would take the trouble to
correct such errors as you may meet with in
the perusal. To point them out, without
correcting them, would be doing nothing,
for I am absolutely incapable of paying the
least attention to such a work; so that if you
would but condescend to alter, add, re∣trench,
and in short use it as you would do
your own, you would do a very great cha∣rity,
for which I should be extremely thank∣ful.
Accept, Sir, my most humble excuses
and salutations.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>J. J. R.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>It is with reluctance I say it, but I am
compelled to it; I now know of a certainty
that this affectation of extreme poverty and
distress was a mere pretence, a petty kind of
imposture which Mr. Rousseau successfully
employed to excite the compassion of the
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
public; but I was then very far from sus∣pecting
any such artifice. I must own, I
felt on this occasion an emotion of pity,
mixed with indignation, to think a man of
letters of such eminent merit, should be re∣duced,
in spite of the simplicity of his man∣ner
of living, to such extreme indigence;
and that this unhappy state should be rendered
more intolerable by sickness, by the approach
of old age, and the implacable rage of per∣secution.
I knew that many persons impu∣ted
the wretchedness of Mr. Rousseau to
his excessive pride, which induced him to
refuse the assistance of his friend; but I
thought this fault, if it were a fault, was a
very respectable one. Too many men of
letters have debated their character in stoop∣ing
so low as to solicit the assistance of per∣sons
of wealth or power, unworthy of af∣fording
them protection; and I conceived
that a noble pride, even though carried to
excess, merited some indulgence in a man of
genius, who, borne up by a sense of his own
superiority and a love of independence, should
have braved the storms of fortune and the in∣sults
of mankind. I proposed, therefore,
to serve Mr. Rousseau in his own way. I
desired Mr. Clairaut, accordingly, to give
me his letter; which I shewed to several of
Mr. Rousseau's friends and patrons in Paris.
At the same time, I proposed to them a
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
scheme, by which he might be relieved,
without suspecting any thing of the matter.
This was to engage the bookseller, who was
to publish his <HI>dictionary,</HI> to give Mr. Rous∣seau
a greater sum for the copy than he had
offered, and to indemnify him by paying him
the difference. But this project, which
could not be executed without the assistance
of Mr. Clairaut, fell to the ground, at the
unexpected decease of that learned and re∣spectable
academician.</P>
<P>Retaining, however, still the same idea
of Mr. Rousseau's excessive poverty, I con∣stantly
retained the same inclination to
oblige him; and when I was informed of
his intention to go to England under my
conduct, I formed a scheme much of the
same kind with that I could not execute at
Paris. I wrote immediately to my friend,
Mr. John Stewart, of Buckingham street,
that I had an affair to communicate to him
of so secret and delicate a nature, that I
should not venture even to commit it to pa∣per,
but that he might learn the particulars
of Mr. Elliot (now Sir Gilbert Elliot) who
would soon return from Paris to London.
The plan was this, and was really communi∣cated
by Mr. Elliot some time after to Mr.
Stewart; who was at the same time en∣joined
to the greatest secrecy.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18"/>
Mr. Stewart was to look out for some ho∣nest
discreet farmer in his neighbourhood in
the country, who might be willing to lodge
and board Mr. Rousseau and his Gouvern∣ante,
in a very decent and plentiful manner,
at a pension which Mr. Stewart might settle
at fifty or sixty pounds a year; the farmer
engaging to keep such agreement a profound
secret, and to receive from Mr. Rousseau
only twenty or twenty-five pounds a year; I
engaging to supply the difference.</P>
<P>It was not long besore Mr. Stewart wrote
me word he had found a situation which he
conceived might be agreeable; on which I
desired he would get the apartment furnished
in a proper and convenient manner at my
expence. But this scheme, in which there
could not possibly enter any motive of vanity
on my part, secrecy being a necessary con∣dition
of its execution, did not take place;
other designs presenting themselves more con∣venient
and agreeable. The sact, however,
is well known both to Mr. Stewart and Sir
Gilbert Elliot.</P>
<P>It will not be improper here to mention
another plan concerted with the same inten∣tions.
I had accompanied Mr. Rousseau
into a very pleasant part of the county of
Surry, where he spent two days at Colonel
Webb's; Mr. Rousseau seeming to me highly
delighted with the natural and solitary beau∣ties
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
of the place. Through the means of
Mr. Stewart, therefore, I entered into treaty
with Colonel Webb for the purchasing the
house, with a little estate adjoining, in
order to make a settlement for Mr. Rous∣seau.
If after what has passed, Mr. Rous∣seau's
testimony be of any validity, I may
appeal to himself for the truth of what
I advance. But be this as it will, these facts
are well known to Mr. Stewart, to General
Clarke, and in part to Colonel Webb.</P>
<P>But to proceed in my narrative. Mr.
Rousseau came to Paris, provided with a
passport, which his friends had obtained for
him. I conducted him to England. For
upwards of two months after our arrival, I
employed myself, and my friends, in look∣ing
out for some agreeable situation for him.
We gave way to all his caprices; excused
all his singularities; indulged him in all his
humours; in short, neither time nor trouble
was spared to procure him what he desired<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">It is probably to this excessive and ill-judged com∣plaisance Mr. H. may in a great degree impute the dis∣agreeable consequences that have followed. There is no end in indulging caprice, nor any prudence in doing it, when it is known to be such. It may be thought hu∣mane to indulge the weak of body or mind, the decre∣pitude of age and imbecility of childhood; but even here it too often proves cruelty to the very parties indulged. How much more inexcusable therefore is it to cherish the absurdities of whim and singularity in men of genius and abilities? How is it possible to make a man easy or happy in a world, to whose customs and maxims he is determined to run retrograde! No. Capricious men, like froward children, should be left to kick against the pricks, and vent their spleen unnoticed. To humour, is only to spoil them. <BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>;
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
and, notwithstanding he rejected several of
the projects which I had laid out for him,
yet I thought myself sufficiently recompensed
for my trouble, by the gratitude and even
affection with which he appeared to repay
my solicitude.</P>
<P>At length his present settlement was pro∣posed
and approved. Mr. Davenport, a
gentleman of family, fortune, and worth,
offered him his house at Wooton, in the
county of Derby, where he himself seldom
resides, and at which Mr. Rousseau and his
housekeeper are boarded, at a very moderate
expence.</P>
<P>When Mr. Rousseau arrived at Wooton,
he wrote me the following letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Mr. ROUSSEAU to Mr. HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Wooton, <DATE>March 22, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU see already, my dear patron, by
the date of my letter, that I am ar∣rived
at the place of my destination; but
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
you cannot see all the charms which I find
in it; to do this, you should be acquainted
with the situation, and be able to read my
heart. You ought, however, to read at
least those of my sentiments with respect to
you, and which you have so well deserved.
If I live in this agreeable asylum as happy as
I hope to do, one of the greatest pleasures
of my life will be, to reflect that I owe it
to you. To make another happy, is to de∣serve
to be happy one's self. May you there∣fore
find in yourself the reward of all you
have done for me! Had I been alone, I
might perhaps have met with hospitality,
but I should have never relished it so highly
as I now do, in owing it to your friendship.
Retain still that friendship for me, my dear
patron; love me for my sake, who am so
much indebted to you; love me for your
own, for the good you have done me. I am
sensible, of the full value of your sincere
friendship; it is the object of my ardent
wishes; I am ready to repay it with all
mine, and feel something in my heart which
may one day convince you that it is not with∣out
its value. As, for the reasons agreed on
between us, I shall receive nothing by the
post, you will be pleased, when you have
the goodness to write to me, to send your
letters to Mr. Davenport. The affair of
the carriage is not yet adjusted, because I
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
know I was imposed on: it is a trifling fault,
however, which may be only the effect of
an obliging vanity, unless it should happen
to be repeated. If you were concerned in
it, I would advise you to give up, once for
all, these little impositions, which cannot
proceed from any good motive, when con∣verted
into snares for simplicity. I embrace
you, my dear patron, with the same cor∣diality
which I hope to find in you.</P>

and as there is nothing in life without its in∣convenience,
that of being too good, is one
of those which is the most tolerable. I find
a much greater inconvenience in not being
able to make the servants understand me,
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
and particularly in my not understanding
them. Luckily Mrs. le Vasseur serves me
as interpreter, and her fingers speak better
than my tongue. There is one advantage
however attending my ignorance, which is a
kind of compensation; it serves to tire
and keep at a distance impertinent visitors.
The minister of the parish came to see me
yesterday, who, finding that I spoke to him
only in French, would not speak to me in
English, so that our interview was almost a
silent one. I have taken a great fancy to
this expedient, and shall make use of it with
all my neighbours, if I have any. Nay,
should I even learn to speak English, I would
converse with them only in French, espe∣cially
if I were so happy as to find they did
not understand a word of that language.
An artifice this, much of the same kind with
that which the Negroes pretend is practised by
the monkeys, who, they say, are capable of
speech, but cannot be prevailed upon to
talk, lest they should be set to work.</P>
<P>It is not true in any sense, that I agreed to
accept of a model from Mr. Gosset as a pre∣sent.
On the contrary, I asked him the
price, which he told me was a guinea and
half, adding that he intended to present me
with it; an offer I did not accept. I desire
you therefore to pay him for it, and Mr.
Davenport will be so good as repay you the
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
money. And if Mr. Gosset does not consent
to be paid for it, it must be returned to him,
and purchased by some other hand. It is
designed for Mr. du Peyrou, who desired
long since to have my portrait, and caused
one to be painted in miniature, which is not
at all like me. You were more fortunate in
this respect than he, but I am sorry that, by
your assiduity to serve me, you deprived me of
the pleasure of discharging the same friendly
obligation with regard to yourself. Be so good,
my dear patron, as to order the model to be
sent to Messrs. Guinand and Hankey, Little
St. Helen's, Bishopsgate-street, in order to
be transmitted to Mr. du Peyrou by the first
safe conveyance. It hath been a frost ever
since I have been here: the snow falls daily;
and the wind is cutting and severe: notwith∣standing
all which, I had rather lodge in the
hollow trunk of an old tree, in this country,
than in the most superb apartment in London.
Good day, my dear patron. I embrace you
with all my heart.</P>

<P>Mr. Rousseau and I having agreed not to
lay each other under any restraint by a con∣tinued
correspondence, the only subject of
our future letters was the obtaining a pension
for him from the king of England; which
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
was then in agitation; and of which affair
the following is a concise and faithful rela∣tion.</P>
<P>As we were conversing together one eve∣ning
at Calais, where we were detained by
contrary winds, I asked Mr. Rousseau if he
would not accept of a pension from the king
of England, in case his majesty should be
pleased to grant him one. To this he re∣plied,
it was a matter of some difficulty to re∣solved
on; but that he should be entirely di∣rected
by the advice of my Lord Marshall.
Encouraged by this answer, I no sooner ar∣rived
in London, than I addressed myself to
his majesty's ministers, and particularly to
General Conway, Secretary of State, and
General Graeme, Secretary and Chamberlain
to the queen. Application was accordingly
made to their majesties, who with their usual
goodness consented, on condition only that
the affair should not be made publick. Mr.
Rousseau and I both wrote to my Lord
Marshall; and Mr. Rousseau expressly ob∣served
in his letter, that the circumstance of
the affair's being to be kept secret, was very
agreeable to him. The consent of my Lord
Marshall arrived, as may readily be imagi∣ned;
soon after which Mr. Rousseau set out
for Wooton; while the business remained
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
some time in suspense, on account of the in∣disposition
of General Conway.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I began to be afraid,
from what I had observed of Mr. Rous∣seau's
disposition and character, that his na∣tural
restlessness of mind would prevent
his enjoyment of that repose, to which
the hospitality and security he found in Eng∣land,
invited him. I saw, with infinite re∣gret,
that he was born for storms and tu∣mults,
and that the disgust which might
succeed the peaceful enjoyment of solitude
and tranquillity, would soon render him a
burthen to himself and every body about
him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In forming the opinion of Mr. Rousseau's dispo∣sition, Mr. Hume was by no means singular: the strik∣ing features of Mr. Rousseau's extraordinary character having been strongly marked in the criticisms on his several writings, in the Monthly Review, particularly in the account of his Letters from the mountains, in the appendix to the 31st vol. of that work; where this cele∣brated genius is described, merely from the general tenour of his writings and the outlines of his publick conduct, to be exactly such a kind of person as Mr. Hume hath discovered him from intimate and personal acquaint∣ance. <BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. But, as I lived at the distance of an
hundred and fifty miles from the place of
his residence, and was constantly employed
in doing him good offices, I did not expect
that I myself should be the victim of this un∣happy
disposition.</P>

It is necessary to introduce here a letter,
which was written last winter, at Paris, in
the name of the king of Prussia.</P>

<P>This letter was written by Mr. Horace
Walpole, about three weeks before I left
Paris; but though we lodged in the same
hotel, and were often together, Mr. Wal∣pole,
out of regard to me, carefully con∣cealed
this piece of pleasantry till after my
departure. He then shewed it to some
friends, who took copies; and those of
course presently multiplied: so that this little
piece had been spread with rapidity all over
Europe, and was in every body's hands
when I saw it, for the first time, in London.</P>
<P>I believe every one will allow, who knows
any thing of the liberty of this country, that
such a piece of raillery could not, even by
the utmost influence of kings, lords and
commons, by all the authority ecclesiastical,
civil and military, be kept from finding its
way to the press. It was accordingly pub∣lished
in the St. James's Chronicle, and a

<P>YOU have been wanting in that respect
which every private person owes to
crowned heads, in publickly ascribing to the
king of Prussia, a letter full of baseness and
extravagance; by which circumstance alone
you might be very well assured he could not

and, what rends and afflicts my heart, that
the impostor hath his accomplices in England.</P>
<P>In justice to the king of Prussia, to truth

yourself for, if you knew of what
atrociousness you have been made the instru∣ment.

I was sorry to see Mr. Rousseau display
such an excess of sensibility, on account of
so simple and unavoidable an incident, as
the publication of this pretended letter from
the King of Prussia. But I should have
accused myself of a most black and ma∣levolent
disposition, if I had imagined Mr.
Rousseau could have suspected me to have
been the editor of it; or that he had inten∣tionally
directed his resentment against me.
He now informs me, however, that this
was really the case. Just eight days before,
I had received a letter, written in the most
amicable terms imaginable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of the 29th of March.</NOTE>. I am, surely,
the last man in the world, who, in common
sense ought to be suspected; yet, without
even the pretence of the smallest proof or
probability, I am, of a sudden, the first
man not only suspected, but certainly con∣cluded
to be the publisher; I am, without
further enquiry or explication, intentionally
insulted in a public paper; I am, from the
dearest friend, converted into a treacherous
and malignant enemy; and all my present
and past services are at one stroke very art∣fully
cancelled. Were it not ridiculous to
employ reasoning on such a subject, and
with such a man, I might ask Mr. Rousseau,
<Q REND="inline">"Why I am supposed to have any malig∣nity
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
against him?"</Q> My actions, in a hun∣dred
instances, had sufficiently demonstrated
the contrary; and it is not usual for favours
conferred to beget ill-will in the person who
confers them. But supposing I had secretly
entertained an animosity towards him, would
I run the risque of a discovery, by so silly a
vengeance, and by sending this piece to the
press, when I knew, from the usual avidity
of the news-writers to find articles of intel∣ligence,
that it must necessarily in a few
days be laid hold of?</P>
<P>But not imagining that I was the object
of so black and ridiculous a suspicion, I pur∣sued
my usual train, by serving my friend
in the least doubtful manner. I renewed my
applications to General Conway, as soon as
the state of that gentleman's health permitted
it: the General applies again to his Majesty:
his Majesty's consent is renewed: the Mar∣quis
of Rockingham, first commissioner of
the Treasury, is also applied to: the whole
affair is happily finished; and full of joy, I
conveyed the intelligence to my friend. On
which Mr. Conway soon after received the
following letter.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFFECTED with a most lively
sense of the favour his Majesty hath
honoured me with, and with that of your
goodness, which procured it me; it affords
me the most pleasing sensation to reflect,
that the best of Kings, and the Minister
most worthy of his confidence, are pleased
to interest themselves in my fortune. This,
Sir, is an advantage of which I am justly
tenacious, and which I will never deserve to
lose. But it is necessary I should speak to
you with that frankness you admire. After
the many misfortunes that have befallen me,
I thought myself armed against all possible
events: there have happened to me some,
however, which I did not foresee; and which
indeed an ingenuous mind ought not to have
foreseen: hence it is that they affect me by
so much the more severely. The trouble in
which they involve me, indeed, deprives me
of the ease and presence of mind necessary
to direct my conduct: all I can reasonably
do, under so distressed a situation, is to sus∣pend
my resolutions about every affair of such
importance as is that in agitation. So far
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
from refusing the beneficence of the King
from pride, as is imputed to me, I am proud
of acknowleging it, and am only sorry I
cannot do it more publicly. But when I
actually receive it, I would be able to give
up myself entirely to those sentiments which
it would naturally inspire, and to have an
heart replete with gratitude for his Majesty's
goodness, and yours. I am not at all afraid
this manner of thinking will make any al∣teration
in yours towards me. Deign, there∣fore,
Sir, to preserve that goodness for me,
till a more happy opportunity; when you
will be satisfied that I defer taking the ad∣vantage
of it, only to render myself more
worthy of it. I beg of you, Sir, to accept
of my most humble and respectful saluta∣tions.</P>

<P>This letter appeared both to General Con∣way
and to me a plain refusal, as long as the
article of secrecy was insisted on; but as I
knew that Mr. Rousseau had been acquaint∣ed
with that condition from the beginning,
I was the less surprized at his silence towards
me. I thought, that my friend, conscious
of having treated me ill in this affair, was
ashamed to write to me; and having pre∣vailed
on General Conway to keep the mat∣ter
still open, I wrote a very friendly letter
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
to Mr. Rousseau, exhorting him to return
to his former way of thinking, and to ac∣cept
of the pension.</P>
<P>As to the deep distress which he mentions
to General Conway, and which, he says,
deprives him even of the use of his reason,
I was set very much at ease on that head,
by receiving a letter from Mr. Davenport;
who told me, that his guest was at that
very time extremely happy, easy, chearful, and
even sociable. I saw plainly, in this event,
the usual infirmity of my friend, who wishes
to interest the world in his favour, by pas∣sing
for sickly, and persecuted, and distres∣sed,
and unfortunate, beyond all measure,
even while he is the most happy and con∣tented.
His pretences of an extreme sen∣sibility
had been too frequently repeated, to
have any effect on a man who was so well
acquainted with them.</P>
<P>I waited three weeks in vain for an an∣swer:
I thought this a little strange, and I
even wrote so to Mr. Davenport; but hav∣ing
to do with a very odd sort of a man, and
still accounting for his silence, by supposing
him ashamed to write to me, I was resolved
not to be discouraged, nor to lose the oppor∣tunity
of doing him an essential service, on
account of a vain ceremonial. I accordingly
renewed my applications to the Ministers,
and was so happy as to be enabled to write
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
the following letter to Mr. Rousseau, the
only one of so old a date of which I have
a copy.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Lisle-street, Leicester-fields, <DATE>19 June, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have not received any answer from
you, I conclude, that you persevere
in the same resolution of refusing all marks
of his Majesty's goodness, as long as they
must remain a secret. I have therefore ap∣plied
to General Conway to have this con∣dition
removed; and I was so fortunate as
to obtain his promise that he would
speak to the King for that purpose. It
will only be requisite, said he, that we
know previously from Mr. Rousseau, whe∣ther
he would accept of a pension publicly
granted him, that his Majesty may not be
exposed to a second refusal. He gave me
authority to write to you on that subject; and
I beg to hear your resolution as soon as pos∣sible.
If you give your consent, which I
earnestly intreat you to do, I know, that I
could depend on the good offices of the
Duke of Richmond, to second General
Conway's application; so that I have no
doubt of success. I am, my Dear Sir,</P>

<P>I Imagined, Sir, that my silence, truly in∣terpreted
by your own conscience, had
said enough; but since you have some de∣sign
in not understanding me, I shall speak.
You have but ill disguised yourself. I know
you, and you are not ignorant of it. Before
we had any personal connections, quarrels,
or disputes; while we knew each other
only by literary reputation, you affectionately
made me the offer of the good offices of
yourself and friends. Affected by this ge∣nerosity,
I threw myself into your arms;
you brought me to England, apparently to
procure me an asylum, but in fact to bring
me to dishonour. You applied to this noble
work, with a zeal worthy of your heart, and
a success worthy of your abilities. You
needed not have taken so much pains: you
live and converse with the world; I with my∣self
in solitude. The public love to be de∣ceived,
and you were formed to deceive them.
I know one man, however, whom you can
not deceive; I mean yourself. You know
with what horrour my heart rejected the
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
first suspicion of your designs. You know
I embraced you with tears in my eyes, and
told you, if you were not the best of men,
you must be the blackest of mankind. In
reflecting on your private conduct, you must
say to yourself sometimes, you are not the
best of men: under which conviction, I
doubt much if ever you will be the happiest.</P>
<P>I leave your friends and you to carry on
your schemes as you please; giving up to
you, without regret, my reputation during
life; certain that sooner or later justice will
be done to that of both. As to your good
offices in matters of interest, which you
have made use of as a mask, I thank you
for them, and shall dispense with profiting
by them. I ought not to hold a correspond∣ence
with you any longer, or to accept of
it to my advantage in any affair in which
you are to be the mediator. Adieu, Sir, I
wish you the truest happiness; but as we
ought not to have any thing to say to each

you will receive from me.</P>

<P>AS I am conscious of having ever acted
towards you the most friendly part,
of having always given the most tender, the
most active proofs of sincere affection; you
may judge of my extreme surprize on per∣using
your epistle. Such violent accusations,
confined altogether to generals, it is as im∣possible
to answer, as it is impossible to com∣prehend
them. But affairs cannot, must
not remain on that footing. I shall chari∣tably
suppose, that some infamous calumni∣ator
has belied me to you. But in that case,
it is your duty, and I am persuaded it will
be your inclination, to give me an oppor∣tunity
of detecting him, and of justifying
myself; which can only be done by your
mentioning the particulars of which I am
accused. You say, that I myself know
that I have been false to you; but I say it
loudly, and will say it to the whole world,
that I know the contrary, that I know my
friendship towards you has been unbounded
and uninterrupted, and that though instances
of it have been very generally remarked
both in France and England, the smallest part
of it only has as yet come to the knowlege
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
of the public. I demand, that you will
produce me the man who will assert the
contrary; and above all, I demand, that he
will mention any one particular in which I
have been wanting to you. You owe this
to me; you owe it to yourself; you owe it
to truth, and honour, and justice, and to
every thing that can be deemed sacred among
men. As an innocent man; I will not say,
as your friend; I will not say, as your bene∣factor;
but, I repeat it, as an innocent
man, I claim the privilege of proving my
innocence, and of refuting any scandalous
lie which may have been invented against
me. Mr. Davenport, to whom I have sent
a copy of your letter, and who will read this
before he delivers it, I am confident, will se∣cond
my demand, and will tell you, that no∣thing
possibly can be more equitable. Happily
I have preserved the letter you wrote me after
your arrival at Wooton; and you there ex∣press
in the strongest terms, indeed in terms
too strong, your satisfaction in my poor en∣deavours
to serve you: the little epistolary
intercourse which afterwards passed between
us, has been all employed on my side to the
most friendly purposes. Tell me, what has
since given you offence? Tell me of what
I am accused. Tell me the man who ac∣cuses
me. Even after you have fulfilled all
these conditions, to my satisfaction, and to
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
that of Mr. Davenport, you will have great
difficulty to justify the employing such out∣rageous
terms towards a man, with whom
you have been so intimately connected, and
whom, on many accounts, you ought to
have treated with some regard and decency.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport knows the whole transac∣tion
about your pension, because I thought it
necessary that the person who had under∣taken
your settlement, should be fully ac∣quainted
with your circumstances; lest he
should be tempted to perform towards you
concealed acts of generosity, which, if they
accidentally came to your knowlege, might
give you some grounds of offence. I am,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM indisposed, and little in a situation
to write; but you require an explana∣tion,
and it must be given you: it was your
own fault you had it not long since; but
you did not desire it, and I was therefore
silent: at present you do, and I have sent
it. I will be a long one, for which I am
very sorry; but I have much to say, and
would put an end to the subject at once.</P>
<P>As I live retired from the world, I am
ignorant of what passes in it. I have no
party, no associates, no intrigues; I am told
nothing, and I know only what I feel. But
as care hath been taken to make me severely
feel; that I well know. The first concern
of those who engage in bad designs is to se∣cure
themselves from legal proofs of detec∣tion:
it would not be very adviseable to seek
a remedy against them at law. The innate
conviction of the heart admits of another
kind of proof, which influences the senti∣ments
of honest men. You well know the
basis of mine.</P>
<P>You ask me, with great confidence, to
name your accuser. That accuser, Sir, is
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
the only man in the world whose testimony
I should admit against you; it is yourself. I
shall give myself up without fear or reserve
to the natural frankness of my disposition;
being an enemy to every kind of artifice, I
shall speak with the same freedom as if you
were an indifferent person, on whom I placed
all that confidence which I no longer have
in you. I will give you an history of the
emotions of my heart, and of what produced
them; while, speaking of Mr. Hume in the
third person, I shall make yourself the judge
of what I ought to think of him. Notwith∣standing
the length of my letter, I shall pur∣sue
no other order than that of my ideas,
beginning with the premises, and ending
with the demonstration.</P>
<P>I quitted Switzerland, wearied out by the
barbarous treatment I had undergone; but
which affected only my personal security,
while my honour was safe. I was going, as
my heart directed me, to join my Lord Mar∣shal;
when I received at Strasburg a most af∣fectionate
invitation from Mr. Hume, to go
over with him to England; where he pro∣mised
me the most agreeable reception, and
more tranquillity than I have met with. I he∣sitated
some time between my old friend and
my new one; in this I was wrong. I pre∣ferred
the latter, and in this was still more
so. But the desire of visiting in person a ce∣lebrated
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
nation, of which I had heard both
so much good and so much ill, prevailed.
Assured I could not lose George Keith, I
was flattered with the acquisition of David
Hume. His great merit, extraordinary abi∣lities,
and established probity of character,
made me desirous of annexing his friendship
to that with which I was honoured by his
illustrious countryman. Besides, I gloried
not a little in setting an example to men of
letters, in a sincere union between two men
so different in their principles.</P>
<P>Before I had received an invitation from
the King of Prussia, and my Lord Marshal,
undetermined about the place of my retreat,
I had desired, and obtained by the interest of
my friends, a passport from the Court of
France. I made use of this, and went to
Paris to join Mr. Hume. He saw, and per∣haps
saw too much of, the favourable reception
I met with from a great Prince, and I will
venture to say, of the public. I yielded, as
it was my duty, though with reluctance, to
that eclat; concluding how far it must excite
the envy of my enemies. At the same time,
I saw with pleasure the regard which the
public entertained for Mr. Hume, sensibly
increasing throughout Paris, on account
of the good work he had undertaken
with respect to me. Doubtless he was af∣fected
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
too; but I know not if it was in the
same manner as I was.</P>
<P>We set out with one of my friends, who
came to England almost entirely on my ac∣count.
When we were landed at Dover,
transported with the thoughts of having set
foot in this land of liberty, under the conduct
of so celebrated a person, I threw my arms
round his neck, and pressed him to my heart,
without speaking a syllable; bathing his checks,
as I kissed them, with tears sufficiently expres∣sive.
This was not the only, not the most re∣markable
instance I have given him of the ef∣fusions
of an heart full of sensibility. I know not
what he does with the recollection of them,
when that happens; but I have a notion
they must be sometimes troublesome to him.</P>
<P>At our arrival in London, we were migh∣tily
caressed and entertained: all ranks of
people eagerly pressing to give me marks of
their benevolence and esteem. Mr. Hume
presented me politely to every body; and it
was natural for me to ascribe to him, as I
did, the best part of my good reception. My
heart was full of him. I spoke in his praise
to every one, I wrote to the same purpose to
all my friends; my attachment to him ga∣thering
every day new strength, while his
appeared the most affectionate to me; of
which he frequently gave me instances that
touched me extremely. That of causing my
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
portrait to be painted, however, was not of
the number. This seemed to me to carry
with it too much the affectation of popula∣rity,
and had an air of ostentation which by
no means pleased me. All this, however,
might have been easily excusable, had Mr.
Hume been a man apt to throw away his
money, or had a gallery of pictures with
the portraits of his friends. After all, I freely
confess, that, on this head, I may be in the
wrong<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fact was this. My friend, Mr. Ramsay, a painter of eminence, and a man of merit, proposed to draw Mr. Rousseau's picture; and when he had begun it, told me he intended to make me a present of it. Thus the design of having Mr. Rousseau's picture drawn did not come from me, nor did it cost me any thing. Mr. Rousseau, therefore, is equally contemptible in paying me a compliment for this pretended gallantry, in his letter of the 29th of March, and in converting it into ridicule here. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But what appears to me an act of friend∣ship
and generosity the most undoubted and
estimable, in a word, the most worthy of
Mr. Hume, was the care he took to solicit
for me, of his own accord, a pension from the
King; to which most assuredly I had no right
to aspire. As I was a witness to the zeal he
exerted in that affair, I was greatly affected
with it. Nothing could flatter me more than
a piece of service of that nature; not merely
for the sake of interest; for, too much at∣tached,
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
perhaps, to what I actually possess,
I am not capable of desiring what I have not,
and as I am able to subsist on my labour and
the assistance of my friends, I covet nothing
more. But the honour of receiving testimo∣nies
of the goodness, I will not say of so
great a monarch, but of so good a father, so
good a husband, so good a master, so good
a friend, and above all, so worthy a man,
was sensibly affecting: and when I consider∣ed
farther, that the minister who had ob∣tained
for me this favour, was a living instance
of that probity which of all others is the most
important to mankind, and at the same time
hardly ever met with in the only character
wherein it can be useful, I could not check
the emotions of my pride, at having for my
benefactors three men, who of all the world
I could most desire to have my friends. Thus,
so far from refusing the pension offered me,
I only made one condition necessary for my
acceptance; this was the consent of a person,
whom I could not, without neglecting my
duty, fail to consult.</P>
<P>Being honoured with the civilities of all
the world, I endeavoured to make a proper
return. In the mean time, my bad state of
health, and being accustomed to live in the
country, made my residence in town very
disagreeable. Immediately country houses
presented themselves in plenty; I had my
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
choice of all the counties of England. Mr.
Hume took the trouble to receive these pro∣posals,
and to represent them to me; accom∣panying
me to two or three in the neighbour∣ing
counties. I hesitated a good while in my
choice, and he increased the difficulty of de∣termination.
At length, I fixed on this
place, and immediately Mr. Hume settled
the affair; all difficulties vanished, and I de∣parted;
arriving presently at this solitary, con∣venient,
and agreeable habitation; where the
owner of the house provides every thing, and
nothing is wanting. I became tranquil, in∣dependant;
and this seemed to be the wished
for moment, when all my misfortunes should
have an end. On the contrary, it was now
they began; misfortunes more cruel than any
I had yet experienced.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have spoken in the fulness of
my heart, and to do justice, with the greatest
pleasure, to the good offices of Mr. Hume.
Would to Heaven that what remains for me
to say were of the same nature! It would
never give me pain to speak what would re∣dound
to his honour; nor is it proper to set
a value on benefits till one is accused of in∣gratitude;
which is the case at present. I
will venture to make one observation, there∣fore,
which renders it necessary. In esti∣mating
the services of Mr. Hume, by the
time and the pains they took him up, they
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
were of an infinite value, and that still more
from the good-will displayed in their per∣formance;
but for the actual service they
were of to me, it was much more in ap∣pearance
than reality. I did not come over
to beg my bread in England; I brought the
means of subsistence with me. I came merely
to seek an asylum in a country which is open
to every stranger without distinction. I was,
besides, not so totally unknown as that, if I
had arrived alone, I should have wanted either
assistance or service. If some persons have
sought my acquaintance for the sake of Mr.
Hume, others have sought it for my own.
Thus when Mr. Davenport, for example,
was so kind as to offer my present retreat, it
was not for the sake of Mr. Hume, whom
he did not know, and whom he saw only in
order to desire him to make me his obliging
proposal. So that when Mr. Hume endeavours
to alienate from me this worthy man, he
takes that from me which he did not give
me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rousseau forms a wrong judgment of me, and ought to know me better. I have written to Mr. Davenport, even since our rupture, to engage him to continue his kindness to his unhappy guest. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. All the good that hath been done me,
would have been done me nearly the same
without him, and perhaps better; but the
evil would not have been done me at all: for
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
why should I have enemies in England?
Why are those enemies all the friends of Mr.
Hume? Who could have excited their en∣mity
against me? It certainly was not I; who
knew nothing of them, nor ever saw them
in my life: I should not have had a single
enemy had I come to England alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How strange are the effects of a disordered ima∣gination! Mr. Rousseau tells us he is ignorant of what passes in the world, and yet talks of the enemies he has in England. How does he know this? Where did he see them? He hath received nothing but marks of bene∣ficence and hospitality. Mr. Walpole is the only person who hath thrown out a little piece of raillery against him; but is not therefore his enemy. If Mr. Rousseau could have seen things exactly as they are, he would have seen that he had no other friend in England but me, and no other enemy but himself. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have hitherto dwelt upon public and no∣torious
facts; which from their own nature,
and my acknowledgment, have made the
greatest eclat. Those which are to follow
are particular and secret, at least in their
cause, and all possible measures have been tak∣en
to keep the knowledge of them from the
public; but as they are well known to the
person interested, they will not have the less
influence toward his own conviction.</P>
<P>A very short time after our arrival in Lon∣don,
I observed an absurd change in the
minds of the people regarding me, which
soon became very apparent. Before I arrived
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
in England, there was not a nation in Eu∣rope
in which I had a greater reputation, I
will venture to say, was held in greater esti∣mation.
The public papers were full of en∣comiums
on me, and a general outcry pre∣vailed
on my persecutors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a general outcry should prevail against Mr. Rousseau's persecutors in England is no wonder: such an outcry would have prevailed from sentiments of hu∣manity, had he been a person of much less note; so that this is no proof of his being esteemed: and as to the enco∣miums on him inserted in the public news papers, the va∣lue of such kind of puffs is well known in England. I have already observed that the authors of more respectable works were at no loss what to think of Mr. Rousseau; but had formed a proper judgment of him long before his arrival in England. The genius which displayed itself in his writings, did, by no means, blind the eyes of the more sensible part of mankind to the absurdity and inconsistency of his opinions and conduct. In exclaim∣ing against Mr. Rousseau's fanatical persecutors, they did not think him the more possessed of the true spirit of mar∣tyrdom. The general opinion indeed, was, that he had too much philosophy to be very devout, and had too much devotion to have much philosophy.
<BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. This was the
case at my arrival, which was published in
the news papers with triumph; England
prided itself in affording me refuge, and
justly gloried on that occasion in its laws and
government: when, all of a sudden, without
the least assignable cause, the tone was
changed; and that so speedily and totally,
that of all the caprices of the public, never
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
was known any thing more surprizing. The
signal was given in a certain <HI>Magazine,</HI>
equally full of follies and falshoods, in which
the author, being well informed, or pretend∣ing
to be so, gives me out for the son of a
musician. From this time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rousseau knows very little of the public judg∣ment in England, if he thinks it is to be influenced by any story told in a certain Magazine. But, as I have before said, it was not from this time that Mr. Rousseau was slightingly spoke of, but long before; and that in a more consequential manner. Perhaps, indeed, Mr. Rousseau ought in justice to impute great part of those civilities he met with on his arrival, rather to vanity and curiosity than to respect and esteem.
<BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, I was con∣stantly
spoken of in print in a very equivocal
or slighting manner. Every thing that had
been published concerning my misfortunes
was misrepresented, altered, or placed in a
wrong light, and always as much as possible
to my disadvantage. So far was any body
from speaking of the reception I met with at
Paris, and which had made but too much
noise, it was not generally supposed that I
durst have appeared in that city; even one of
Mr. Hume's friends being very much sur∣prized
when I told him I came through it.</P>
<P>Accustomed as I had been too much to
the inconstancy of the public, to be affected
by this instance of it, I could not help being
astonished, however, at a change, so very
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
sudden and general, that not one of those
who had so much praised me in my absence,
appeared, now I was present, to think even
of my existence. I thought it something
very odd that, immediately after the return of
Mr. Hume, who had so much credit in Lon∣don,
with so much influence over the book∣sellers
and men of letters, and such great
connections with them, his presence should
produce an effect so contrary to what might
have been expected; that among so many
writers of every kind, not one of his friends
should shew himself to be mine; while it
was easy to be seen, that those who spoke
of him were not his enemies, since, in no∣ticing
his public character, they reported
that I had come through France under his
protection, and by favour of a passport
which he had obtained of the court; nay,
they almost went so far as to insinuate, that
I came over in his retinue, and at his ex∣pence.
All this was of little significa∣tion,
and was only singular; but what
was much more so, was, that his friends
changed their tone with me as much as the
public. I shall always take a pleasure in
saying that they were still equally solicitous
to serve me, and that they exerted themselves
greatly in my favour; but so far were they
from shewing me the same respect, particularly
the gentleman at whose house we alighted
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
on our arrival, that he accompanied all his
actions with discourse so rude, and sometimes
so insulting, that one would have thought
he had taken an occasion to oblige me,
merely to have a right to express his con∣tempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This relates to my friend Mr. John Stewart, who entertained Mr. Rousseau at his house, and did him all the good offices in his power. Mr. Rousseau, in com∣plaining of this gentleman's behaviour, forgets that he wrote Mr. Stewart a letter from Wooton, full of ac∣knowlegements, and just expressions of gratitude. What Mr. Rousseau adds, regarding the brother of Mr. Stewart, is neither civil nor true.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.
His brother, who was at first
very polite and obliging, altered his beha∣viour
with so little reserve, that he would
hardly deign to speak a single word to me
even in their own house, in return to a civil
salutation, or to pay any of those civilities
which are usually paid in like circumstances
to strangers. Nothing new had happened,
however, except the arrival of J. J. Rous∣seau
and David Hume: and certainly the
cause of these alterations did not come from
me, unless indeed too great a portion of sim∣plicity,
discretion, and modesty, be the
cause of offence in England. As to Mr.
Hume, he was so far from assuming such a
disgusting tone, that he gave into the other
extreme. I have always looked upon flat∣terers
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
with an eye of suspicion: and he was
so full of all kinds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I shall mention only one, that made me smile; this was, his attention to have, every time I came to see him, a volume of <HI>Elcisa</HI> upon his table; as if I did not know enough of Mr. Hume's taste for reading, as to be well assured, that of all books in the world, Eloisa must be one of the most tiresome to him.
<BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE> of flattery, that he
even obliged me, when I could bear it no
longer<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The reader may judge from the two first letters of Mr. Rousseau, which I published with that view, on which side the slatteries commenced. As for the rest, I loved and esteemed Mr. Rousseau, and took a plea∣sure in giving him to understand so. I might perhaps be too lavish in my praises; but I can assure the reader he never once complained of it.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, to tell him my sentiments on that
head. His behaviour was such as to render
few words necessary, yet I could have wish∣ed
he had substituted, in the room of such
gross encomiums, sometimes the language
of a friend; but I never found any thing in
his, which favoured of true friendship, not
even in his manner of speaking of me to
others in my presence. One would have
thought that, in endeavouring to procure
me patrons, he strove to deprive me of their
good-will; that he sought rather to have
me assisted than loved; and I have been
sometimes surprized at the rude turn he
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
hath given to my behaviour before people
who might not unreasonably have taken of∣fence
at it. I shall give an example of what
I mean. Mr. Pennick of the Museum, a
friend of my Lord Marshal's, and minister
of a parish where I was solicited to refide,
came to see me. Mr. Hume made my ex∣cuses,
while I myself was present, for not
having paid him a visit. Doctor Matty,
said he, invited us on Thursday to the Mu∣seum,
where Mr. Rousseau should have seen
you; but he chose rather to go with Mrs.
Garrick to the play: we could not do both
the same day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I don't recollect a single circumstance of this his∣tory; but what makes me give very little credit to it, is, that I remember very well we had settled two dif∣ferent days for the purposes mentioned, that is, one to go to the Museum, and another to the play.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. You will confess, Sir, this
was a strange method of recommending me
to Mr. Pennick.</P>
<P>I know not what Mr. Hume might say
in private of me to his acquaintance, but
nothing was more extraordinary than their
behaviour to me, even by his own confes∣sion,
and even often through his own means.
Although my purse was not empty, and I
needed not that of any other person; which
he very well knew; yet any one would have
thought I was come over to subsist on the
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
charity of the public, and that nothing
more was to be done than to give me alms
in such a manner as to save me a little con∣fusion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I conceive Mr. Rousseau hints here at two or three dinners, that were sent him from the house of Mr. Steward, when he chose to dine at his own lodg∣ings; this was not done, however, to save him the expence of a meal, but because there was no conve∣nient tavern or chop-house in the neighbourhood. I beg the reader's pardon for descending to such trivial particulars. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.
I must own, this constant and
insolent piece of affectation was one of those
things which made me averse to reside in
London. This certainly was not the foot∣ing
on which any man should have been in∣troduced
in England, had there been a de∣sign
of procuring him ever so little respect.
This display of charity, however, may ad∣mit
of a more favourable interpretation, and
I consent it should. To proceed.</P>
<P>At Paris was published a fictitious letter
from the King of Prussia, addressed to me,
and replete with the most cruel malignity.
I learned with surprize that it was one Mr.
Walpole, a friend of Mr. Hume's, who was
the editor; I asked him if it were true; in
answer to which question, he only asked me,
of whom I had the information. A mo∣ment
before he had given me a card for this
same Mr. Walpole, written to engage him
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
to bring over such papers as related to me
from Paris, and which I wanted to have by
a safe hand.</P>
<P>I was informed that the son of that
quack<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have not been authorized to suppress this af∣fronting term; but it is too gross and groundless to do any injury to the celebrated and respectable physician to whose name it is annexed.
<BIBL>FRENCH EDITORS.</BIBL></NOTE> Tronchin, my most mortal enemy,
was not only the friend of Mr. Hume, and
under his protection, but that they both
lodged in the same house together; and when
Mr. Hume found that I knew it, he impart∣ed
it in confidence; assuring me at the same
time, that the son was by no means like the
father. I lodged a few nights myself, toge∣ther
with my governante, in the same
house; and by the air and manner with
which we were received by the landladies,
who are his friends, I judged in what man∣ner
either Mr. Hume, or that man, who,
as he said, who by no means like his father,
must have spoken to them both of her and
me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thus am I accused of treachery, because I am a friend of Mr. Walpole, who hath thrown out a little raillery on Mr. Rousseau; and because the son of a man whom Mr. Rousseau does not like, lodges by ac∣cident in the same house; because my landladies, who do not understand a syllable of French, received Mr. Rousseau coldly. As to the rest, and that I said to Mr. Rous∣seau about the young Tronchin was, that he had not the same prejudices against him as his father. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58"/>
All these facts put together, added to a
certain appearance of things on the whole,
insensibly gave me an uneasiness, which I re∣jected
with horror. In the mean time, I
found the letters I wrote did not come to
hand; those I received had often been open∣ed;
and all went through the hands of Mr.
Hume<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The story of Mr. Rousseau's letters is as follows. He had often been complaining to me, and with rea∣son, that he was ruined by postage at Neuf-chatel, which commonly cost him 25 or 26 louis d'ors a year; and all for letters which were of no significance, being wrote, some of them by people who took that oppor∣tunity of abusing him, and most of them by persons unknown to him: he was therefore resolved, he said, in England to receive no letters which came by the post; and the same resolution he re-iterates in his letter to me dated the 22d of March. When he went to Chiswick, near London, the post-man brought his letters to me. I carried him out a cargo of them: he exclaimed, desired me to return the letters, and recover the price of postage: I told him, that in that case, the clerks of the post-office were entire masters of his let∣ters: he said, he was indifferent; they might do with them what they pleased. I added, that he would by that means be cut off from all correspondence with all his friends: he replied, that he would give a particular direction to such as he desired to correspond with. But till his instructions for that purpose could arrive, what could I do more friendly, than to save, at my own ex∣pence, his letters from the curiosity and indiscretion of the clerks of the post-office? I am indeed ashamed to find myself obliged to discover such petty circumstances.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. If at any time any one escaped
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
him, he could not conceal his eagerness to
see it. One evening in particular I remem∣ber
a very remarkable circumstance of this
kind, that greatly struck me<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is necessary to explain this circumstance. I had been writing on Mr. Hume's table, during his absence, an answer to a letter I had just received. He came in, very curious to know what I had been writing, and hardly able to contain himself from desiring to read it. I closed my letter, however, without shewing it him; when, as I was putting it into my pocket, he asked me for it eagerly, saying, he would send it away on the morrow, being post-day. The letter lay on the table. Lord Newnham came in. Mr. Hume went out of the room for a moment; on which I took the letter up again, saying I should find time to send it the next day. Lord Newnham offered to get it inclosed in the French ambas∣sador's packet; which I accepted. Mr. Hume re-entered the moment his lordship had inclosed it, and was pulling out his seal. Mr. Hume officiously offered his own seal, and that with so much earnestness, that it could not well be refused. The bell was rung, and Lord Newnham gave the letter to Mr. Hume's servant, to give it his own, who waited below with the chariot, in order to have it sent to the ambassador. Mr. Hume's servant was hardly got out of the room, but I said to myself, I'll lay a wager the master follows. He did not fail to do as I expected. Not knowing how to leave Lord Newn∣ham alone, I staid some time, before I followed Mr. Hume. I said nothing; but he must perceive that I was uneasy. Thus, although I have received no an∣swer to my letter, I doubt not of its going to hand; but I confess, I cannot help suspecting it was read first. <BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>. As we
were sitting one evening, after supper, silent
by the fire-side, I caught his eyes intently
fixed on mine, as indeed happened very
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
often; and that in a manner of which it is
very difficult to give an idea; at that time
he gave me a stedfast, piercing look, mixed
with a sneer, which greatly disturbed me.
To get rid of the embarrassment I lay under,
I endeavoured to look full at him in my
turn; but, in fixing my eyes against his,
I felt the most inexpressible terror, and was
obliged soon to turn them away. The speech
and physiognomy of the good David is that
of an honest man; but where, great God!
did this good man borrow those eyes he fixes
so sternly and unaccountably on those of his
friends!</P>
<P>The impression of this look remained
with me, and gave me much uneasiness.
My trouble increased even to a degree of
fainting; and if I had not been relieved by
an effusion of tears, I had been suffocated.
Presently after this I was seized with the
most violent remorse; I even despised my∣self;
till at length, in a transport, which I
still remember with delight, I sprang on his
neck, embraced him eagerly; while almost
choked with sobbing, and bathed in tears, I
cried out, in broken accents, <HI>No, no, David
Hume cannot be treacherous; if he be not the
best of men, he must be the basest of mankind.</HI>
David Hume politely returned my embraces,
and gently tapping me on the back, repeat∣ed
several times, in a good-natured and easy
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
tone, <HI>Why, what my dear Sir! Nay, my
dear Sir ! Oh! my dear Sir!</HI> He said no∣thing
more. I felt my heart yearn within
me. We went to bed; and I set out the
next day for the country.</P>
<P>Arrived at this agreeable asylum, to which
I have travelled so far in search of repose, I
ought to find it in a retired, convenient, and
pleasant habitation; the master of which, a
man of understanding and worth, spares
for nothing to render it agreeable to me.
But what repose can be tasted in life, when
the heart is agitated? Afflicted with the
most cruel uncertainty, and ignorant what
to think of a man whom I ought to love
and esteem, I endeavoured to get rid of that
fatal doubt, in placing confidence in my be∣nefactor.
For, wherefore, from what un∣accountable
caprice should be display so
much apparent zeal for my happiness, and
at the same time entertain secret designs
against my honour. Among the several ob∣servations
that disturbed me, each fact was
in itself of no great moment; it was their
concurrence that was surprizing; yet I
thought, perhaps, that Mr. Hume, inform∣ed
of other facts, of which I was ignorant,
could have given me a satisfactory solution
of them, had we come to an explana∣tion.
The only thing that was inexpli∣cable,
was, that he refused to come to such
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
an explanation; which both his honour
and his friendship rendered equally necessary.
I saw very well there was something in the
affair which I did not comprehend, and
which I earnestly wished to know. Before
I came to an absolute determination, there∣fore,
with regard to him, I was desirous
of making another effort, and to try to
recover him, if he had permitted himself
to be seduced by my enemies, or in short to
prevail on him to explain himself one way
or other. Accordingly I wrote him a letter,
which he ought to have found very na∣tural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears from what he wrote to me afterwards, that he was very well satisfied with this letter, and that he thought of it very well. <BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>,
if he were guilty; but very extra∣ordinary,
if he were innocent. For what
could be more extraordinary than a letter
full of gratitude for his services, and at the
same time, of distrust of his sentiments;
and in which, placing in a manner his
actions on one side, and his sentiments on
the other, instead of speaking of the proofs
of friendship he had given me, I desired
him to love me, for the good he had done
me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My answer to this is contained in Mr. Rousseau's own letter of the 22d of March; wherein he expresses himself with the utmost cordiality, without any re∣serve, and without the least appearance of suspicion.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>? I did not take the precaution to pre∣serve
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
a copy of this letter; but as he hath
done it, let him produce it: and whoever
shall read it, and see therein a man labour∣ing
under a secret trouble, which he is de∣sirous
of expressing, and is afraid to do it,
will, I am persuaded, be curious to know
what kind of eclaircissement it produced,
especially after the preceeding scene. None.
Absolutely none at all. Mr. Hume con∣tented
himself, in his answer, with only
speaking of the obliging offices Mr. Daven∣port
proposed to do for me. As for the rest,
he said not a word of the principal subject of
my letter, nor of the situation of my heart,
of whose distress he could not be ignorant.
I was more struck with this silence, than I
had been with his phlegm during our last con∣versation.
In this I was wrong; this silence
was very natural after the other, and was no
more than I ought to have expected. For
when one hath ventured to declare to man's
face, <HI>I am tempted to believe you a traitor,</HI>
and he hath not the curiosity to ask you <HI>for
what</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this hangs upon the fable he had so artfully worked up, as I before observed. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, it may be depended on he will never
have any such curiosity as long as he lives;
and it is easy to judge of him from these slight
indications.</P>
<P>After the receipt of his letter, which was
long delayed, I determined at length to write
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
to him no more. Soon after, every thing
served to confirm me in the resolution to
break off all farther correspondence with him.
Curious to the last degree concerning the
minutest circumstance of my affairs, he was
not content to learn them of me, in our fre∣quent
conversations; but, as I learned, ne∣ver
let slip an opportunity of being alone
with my governante<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I had only one such opportunity with his gover∣nante, which was on their arrival in London. I must own it never entered into my head to talk to her upon any other subject than the concerns of Mr. Rousseau.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, to interrogate her
even importunately concerning my occupa∣tions,
my resources, my friends, acquaint∣ances,
their names, situations, place of abode,
and all this after setting out with telling her
he was well acquainted with the whole of
my connections; nay, with the most jesu∣itical
address, he would ask the same ques∣tions
of us separately. One ought undoubt∣edly
to interest one's self in the affairs of a
friend; but one ought to be satisfied with
what he thinks proper to let us know of them,
particularly when people are so frank and in∣genuous
as I am. Indeed all this petty inqui∣sitiveness
is very little becoming a philosopher.</P>
<P>About the same time I received two other
letters which had been opened. The one
from Mr. Boswell, the seal of which was so
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
loose and disfigured, that Mr. Davenport,
when he received it, remarked the same to
Mr. Hume's servant. The other was from
Mr. d'Ivernois, in Mr. Hume's packet, and
which had been sealed up again by means of
a hot iron, which, aukwardly applied, had
burnt the paper round the impression. On
this, I wrote to Mr. Davenport to desire
him to take charge of all the letters which
might be sent for me, and to trust none of
them in any body's hands, under any pretext
whatever. I know not whether Mr. Daven∣port,
who certainly was far from thinking
that precaution was to be observed with re∣gard
to Mr. Hume, showed him my letter
or not; but this I know, that the latter had
all the reason in the world to think he had
forfeited my confidence, and that he pro∣ceeded
nevertheless in his usual manner,
without troubling himself about the recovery
of it.</P>
<P>But what was to become of me, when I
saw, in the public papers, the pretended letter
of the King of Prussia, which I had never
before seen, that fictitious letter, printed in
French and English, given for genuine, even
with the signature of the King, and in which
I knew the pen of Mr. d'Alembert as cer∣tainly
as if I had seen him write it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. d'Alembert's declaration on this head, an∣nexed to this narrative.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="66"/>
In a moment a ray of light discovered to
me the secret cause of that touching and sud∣den
change, which I had observed in the
public respecting me; and I saw the plot
which was put in execution at London, had
been laid in Paris.</P>
<P>Mr. d'Alembert, another intimate friend
of Mr. Hume's, had been long since my
secret enemy, and lay in watch for opportu∣nities
to injure me without exposing himself.
He was the only person, among the men of
letters, of my old acquaintance, who did
not come to see me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rousseau declares himself to have been fatigued with the visits he received; ought he therefore to complain that Mr. d'Alembert, whom he did not like, did not importune him with his? <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, or send their civilities
during my last passage through Paris. I
knew his secret disposition, but I gave my∣self
very little trouble about it, content∣ing
myself with advising my friends of it
occasionally. I remember that being asked
about him one day by Mr. Hume, who
afterwards asked my governante the same
question, I told him that Mr. d'Alembert
was a cunning, artful man. He contradicted
me with a warmth that surprized me; not
then knowing they stood so well with each
other, and that it was his own cause he de∣fended.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="67"/>
The perusal of the letter above mentioned
alarmed me a good deal, when, perceiving
that I had been brought over to England in
consequence of a project which began to be
put in execution, but of the end of which I
was ignorant, I felt the danger without
knowing what to guard against, or on whom
to rely. I then recollected four terrify∣ing
words Mr. Hume had made use of, and
of which I shall speak hereafter. What could
be thought of a paper in which my misfor∣tunes
were imputed to me as a crime, which
tended, in the midst of my distress, to de∣prive
me of all compassion, and, to render
its effects still more cruel, pretended to have
been written by a Prince who had afforded
me protection? What could I divine would
be the consequence of such a beginning?
The people in England read the public pa∣pers,
and are in no wise prepossessed in favour
of foreigners. Even a coat, cut in a dif∣ferent
fashion from their own, is sufficient
to excite a prejudice against them. What then
had not a poor stranger to expect in his rural
walks, the only pleasures of his life, when
the good people in the neighbourhood were
once thoroughly persuaded he was fond of
being persecuted and pelted? Doubtless they
would be ready enough to contribute to his
favourite amusement. But my concern, my
profound and cruel concern, the bitterest in∣deed
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
I ever felt, did not arise from the dan∣ger
to which I was personally exposed. I
had braved too many others to be much
moved with that. The treachery of a false
friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <HI>false friend,</HI> is, undoubtedly, myself. But what is the treachery? What harm have I done, or could I do to Mr. Rousseau? On the supposition of my entering into a project to ruin him, how could I think to bring it about by the services I did him? If Mr. Rous∣seau should gain credit, I must be thought still more weak than wicked. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE> to which I had fallen a prey, was
the circumstance that filled my too sus∣ceptible
heart with deadly sorrow. In the
impetuosity of its first emotions, of which I
never yet was master, and of which my ene∣mies
have artfully taken the advantage, I
wrote several letters full of disorder, in which
I did not disguise either my anxiety or indig∣nation.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, so many things to mention,
that I forget half of them by the way. For
instance, a certain narrative in form of a let∣ter,
concerning my manner of living at
Montmorency, was given by the booksellers
to Mr. Hume, who shewed it me. I agreed
to its being printed, and Mr. Hume under∣took
the care of its edition; but it never ap∣peared.
Again, I had brought over with me
a copy of the letters of Mr. du Peyrou, con∣taining
a relation of the treatment I had met
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
with at Neuschatel. I gave them into the
hands of the same bookseller to have them
translated and reprinted. Mr. Hume charged
himself with the care of them; but they ne∣ver
appeared<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The booksellers have lately informed me that the edition is finished, and will shortly be published. This may be; but it is too late, and what is still worse, it is too opportune for the purpose intended to be served.
<BIBL>Mr. ROUSSEAU.</BIBL></NOTE>. The supposititious letter of
the King of Prussia, and its translation, had
no sooner made their appearance, than I im∣mediately
comprehended why the other
pieces had been suppressed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">It is about four months since Mr. Becket, the bookseller, told Mr. Rousseau that the publication of these pieces was delayed on account of the indisposition of the translator. As for any thing else, I never pro∣mised to take any change at all of the edition, as Mr. Becket can testify. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, and I wrote as
much to the booksellers<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">As to Mr. Rousseau's suspicions of the cause of the <HI>suppression,</HI> as he calls it, of the Narrative and Letters above mentioned, the translator thinks it incumbent on him to affirm, they were entirely groundless. It is true, as Mr. Becket told Mr. Hume, that the translator of the letters was indisposed about that time. But the principal cause of the delay was, that he was of his own mere motion, no less indisposed to those pieces making their appearance in English at <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For, so far were the booksellers from intending to <HI>suppress</HI> these pieces, that they actually reprinted the French edition of Peyrou's letters, and published it in London.</NOTE> all; and this not out of ill will to Mr. Rousseau, or good will to Mr. Hume, neither of which he ever saw, or spoke to, in his life; but really out of regard to the character and reputation of a man, whose genius he admired, and whose works he had translated: well knowing the publication of such squabbles could do Mr. Rousseau no good in the opinion of the more judicious and sensible part of mankind. With regard to the translation of the Narrative of his manner of living at Montmorency, I never saw it till it was actually printed; when Mr. Becket put it into my hands, and I frankly told him that I thought it a very unseasonable, puerile affair, and could by no means serve to advance Mr. Rousseau's estimation in the eyes of the public. It was certainly of great importance to the good people of England, to know how Mr. Rous∣seau amused himself 7 or 8 years ago at Montmorency, that he cooked his own broth, and did not leave it to the management of his nurse, for fear she should have a better dinner than himself! Yet this is one of the most remarkable circumstances contained in that narrative, except indeed that we are told, Mr. Rousseau is a most passionate admirer of virtue, and that his eyes always sparkle at the bare mention of that word—O Virtue! how greatly is thy name prostituted! And how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from the teeth outward, are thy nominal votaries!
<BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. I wrote several
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
other letters also, which probably were
handed about London; till at length I em∣ployed
the credit of a man of quality and
merit, to insert a declaration of the imposture
in the public papers. In this declaration. I
concealed no part of my extreme concern;
nor did I in the least disguise the cause.</P>
<P>Hitherto Mr. Hume seems to have walked
in darkness. You will soon see him appear
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
in open day, and act without disguise. No∣thing
more is necessary, in our behaviour
toward cunning people, than to act ingenu∣ously;
sooner or later they will infallibly be∣tray
themselves.</P>
<P>When this pretended letter from the King
of Prussia was first published in London,
Mr. Hume, who certainly knew that it was
fictitious, as I had told him so, yet said no∣thing
of the matter, did not write to me,
but was totally silent; and did not even think
of making any declaration, of the truth, in
favour of his absent friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No body could possibly be mistaken with regard to the letter's being fictitious; besides it was well known that Mr. Walpole was the author of it. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. It answered
his purpose better to let the report take its
course, as he did.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume having been my conductor
into England, he was of course in a manner
my patron and protector. If it were but na∣tural
in him to undertake my defence, it
was to less so that, when I had a public
protestation to make, I should have addressed
myself to him. Having already ceased writ∣ing
to him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rousseau forgets himself here. It was but a week before that he wrote me a very friendly letter. See his letter of the 29th of March. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>, however, I had no mind to
renew our correspondence. I addressed my∣self
therefore to another person. The first
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
slap on the face I gave my patron. He felt
nothing of it.</P>
<P>In saying the letter was fabricated at Paris,
it was of very little consequence to me whe∣ther
it was understood particularly of Mr.
d'Alembert, or of Mr. Walpole, whose
name he borrowed on the occasion. But
in adding that, what afflicted and tore my
heart was, the impostor had got his accom∣plices
in England; I expressed myself very
clearly to their friend, who was in London,
and was desirous of passing for mine. For
certainly he was the only person in England,
whose hatred could afflict and rend my heart.
This was the second slap of the face I gave
my patron. He did not feel, however, yet.</P>
<P>On the contrary, he maliciously pretended
that my affliction arose solely from the pub∣lication
of the above letter, in order to make
me pass for a man who was excessively
affected by satire. Whether I am vain or
not, certain it is I was mortally afflicted; he
knew it, and yet wrote me not a word.
This affectionate friend, who had so much
at heart the filling of my purse, gave him∣self
no trouble to think my heart was bleed∣ing
with sorrow.</P>
<P>Another piece appeared soon after, in the
same papers, by the author of the former,
and still if possible more cruel; in which the
writer could not disguise his rage at the recep∣tion
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
I met with at Paris<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know nothing of this pretended libel.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. This however did
not affect me; it told me nothing new. Mere
libels may take their course without giving
me any emotion; and the inconstant public
may amuse themselves as long as they please
with the subject. It is not an affair of con∣spirators,
who, bent on the destruction of
my honest fame, are determined by some
means or other to effect it. It was necessary
to change the battery.</P>
<P>The affair of the pension was not deter∣mined.
It was not difficult, however, for
Mr. Hume to obtain, from the humanity of
the minister, and the generosity of the King,
the favour of its determination. He was
required to inform me of it, which he did.
This, I must confess, was one of the critical
moments of my life. How much did it cost
me to do my duty! My preceding engage∣ments,
the necessity of shewing a due respect
for the goodness of the King, and for that
of his minister, together with the desire of
displaying how far I was sensible of both;
add to these the advantage of being made a
little more easy in circumstances in the de∣cline
of life, surrounded as I was by enemies
and evils; in fine, the embarrassment I was
under to find a decent excuse for not accept∣ing
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
a benefit already half accepted; all these
together made the necessity of that refusal very
difficult and cruel: for necessary it was, or I
should have been one of the meanest and
basest of mankind to have voluntarily laid my∣self
under an obligation to a man who had
betrayed me.</P>
<P>I did my duty, though not without reluc∣tance.
I wrote immediately to General Con∣way,
and in the most civil and respectful
manner possible, without giving an absolute
refusal, excusing myself from accepting the
pension for the present.</P>
<P>Now, Mr. Hume had been the only ne∣gotiator
of this affair, nay the only person
who had spoke of it. Yet I not only did not
give him any answer, though it was he who
wrote to me on the subject, but did not even
so much as mention him in my letter to Ge∣neral
Conway. This was the third slap of
the face I gave my patron; which if he does
not feel, it is certainly his own fault, he can
feel nothing.</P>
<P>My letter was not clear, nor could it be so
to General Conway, who did not know the
motives of my refusal; but it was very plain
to Mr. Hume, who knew them but too well.
He pretended nevertheless to be deceived as
well with regard to the cause of my discon∣tent,
as to that of my declining the pension;
and, in a letter he wrote me on the occasion,
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
gave me to understand that the king's good∣ness
might be continued towards me, if I
should reconsider the affair of the pension.
In a word he seemed determined, at all
events, to remain still my patron, in spite of
my teeth. You will imagine, Sir, he did
not expect my answer; and he had none.
Much about this time, for I do not know
exactly the date, nor is such precision neces∣sary,
appeared a letter, from Mr. de Voltaire
to me, with an English translation, which still
improved on the original. The noble object
of this ingenious performance, was to draw on
me the hatred and contempt of the people,
among whom I was come to reside. I made
not the least doubt that my dear patron was
one of the instruments of its publication;
particularly when I saw that the writer, in
endeavouring to alienate from me those who
might render my life agreeable, had omitted
the name of him who brought me over.
He doubtless knew that it was superfluous,
and that with regard to him, nothing more
was necessary to be said. The omission of
his name, so impoliticly forgot in this letter,
recalled to my mind what Tacitus says of
the picture of Brutus, omitted in a funeral
solemnity, viz. that every body took notice
of it, particularly because it was not there.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume was not mentioned; but he
lives and converses with people that are men∣tioned.
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
It is well known his friends are all
my enemies; there are abroad such people
as Tronchin, d'Alembert, and Voltaire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have never been so happy as to meet with Mr. de Voltaire; he only did me the honour to write me a letter about three years ago. As to Mr. Tronchin, I never saw him in my life, nor ever had any correspon∣dence with him. Of Mr. d'Alembert's friendship, in∣deed, I am proud to make a boast.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>;
but it is much worse in London; for here
I have no enemies but what are his friends.
For why, indeed, should I have any other!
Why should I have even them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Why indeed? except that sensible people in Eng∣land are averse to affectation and quackery. Those who see and despise these most in Mr. Rousseau, are not, however, his <HI>enemies</HI>; perhaps, if he could be brought to think so, they are his best and truest friends.
<BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>? What
have I done to Lord Littleton<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Rousseau, seeing the letter addressed to him in the name of Voltaire advertised in the public papers, wrote to Mr. Davenport, who was then in London, to desire he would bring it him. I told Mr. Davenport that the printed copy was very faulty, but that I would ask of Lord Littleton a manuscript copy, which was cor∣rect. This is sufficient to make Mr. Rousseau conclude that Lord Littleton is his mortal enemy, and my inti∣mate friend; and that we are in a conspiracy against him. He ought rather to have concluded that the printed copy could not come from me. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></P>

<P>The piece above mentioned was shewn to the <HI>Trans∣later</HI> before its publication, and many absurd liberties taken with the original pointed out and censured. At which time there did not appear, from the parties con∣cerned in it, that Mr. hume could have had the least hand it, or could have known any thing of the edition. <BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></P></NOTE>, whom I
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
don't even know? What have I done to
Mr. Walpole, whom I know full as little?
What do they know of me, except that I am
unhappy, and a friend to their friend Hume?
What can he have said to them, for it is
only through him they know any thing of
me? I can very well imagine that, consi∣dering
the part he has to play, he does not
unmask himself to every body; for then he
would be disguised to no body. I can very
well imagine, that he does not speak of me
to General Conway and the Duke of Rich∣mond,
as he does in his private conversations
with Mr. Walpole, and his secret corre∣spondence
with Mr. d'Alembert; but let
any one discover the clue that hath been un∣ravelled
since my arrival in London, and it
will easily be seen whether Mr. Hume does
not hold the principal thread.
At length the moment arrived in which
it was thought proper to strike the great
blow; the effect of which was prepared for,
by a fresh, satirical piece, put in the papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have never seen this piece, neither before nor after its publication; nor has it come to the knowlege of any body to whom I have spoken of it. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></P>

<P>The <HI>translator,</HI> who has been attentive to every thing that has come out from, or about Mr. Rousseau, knows also nothing of this piece. Why did not Mr. Rousseau mention particularly in what paper, and when it ap∣peared? <BIBL><HI>English translator.</HI></BIBL></P></NOTE>.
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
Had there remained in me the least doubt,
it would have been impossible to have har∣boured
it after perusing this piece; as it con∣tained
facts unknown to any body but Mr.
Hume; exaggerated, it is true, in order to
render them odious to the public.</P>
<P>It is said, in this paper, that my door was
opened to the rich, and shut to the poor.
Pray who knows when my door was open
or shut, except Mr. Hume, with whom I
lived, and by whom every body was intro∣duced
that I saw? I will except one great
personage, whom I gladly received without
knowing him, and whom I should still have
more gladly received if I had known him.
It was Mr. Hume who told me his name,
when he was gone; on which information,
I was really chagrined that, as he deigned
to mount up two pair of stairs, he was not
received in the first floor. As to the poor, I
have nothing to say about the matter. I was
constantly desirous of seeing less company;
but as I was unwilling to displease any one,
I suffered myself to be directed in this af∣fair
altogether by Mr. Hume, and endea∣voured
to receive every body he introduced
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
as well as I could, without distinction, whe∣ther
rich or poor. It is said in the same
piece, that I received my relations very
coldly, <HI>not to say any thing worse.</HI> This
general charge relates to my having once re∣ceived
with some indifference the only rela∣tion
I have, out of Geneva, and that in the
presence of Mr. Hume<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I was not present when Mr. Rousseau received his cousin: I only just saw them afterwards together for about a minute on the terrace in Bucking ham-street.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. It must necessa∣rily
be either Mr. Hume or this relation
who furnished that piece of intelligence.
Now, my cousin, whom I have always
known for a friendly relation, and a worthy
man, is incapable of furnishing materials for
public satires against me. Add to this, that
his situation in life confining him to the con∣versation
of persons in trade, he has no
connection with men of letters, or para∣graph-writers,
and still less with satirists
and libellers. So that the article could not
come from him. At the worst, can I help
imagining that Mr. Hume must have en∣deavoured to take advantage of what he said,
and construed it in favour of his own pur∣pose?
It is not improper to add, that after
my rupture with Mr. Hume, I wrote an
account of it to my cousin.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="80"/>
In fine, it is said in the same paper, that
I am apt to change my friends. No great
subtlety is necessary to comprehend what
this reflection is preparative to.</P>
<P>But let us distinguish facts. I have pre∣served
some very valuable and solid friends
for twenty-five to thirty years. I have
others whose friendship is of a later date,
but no less valuable, and which if I live, I
may preserve still longer. I have not found,
indeed, the same security in general among
those friendships I have made with men of
letters. I have for this reason sometimes
changed them, and shall always change
them, when they appear suspicious; for I
am determined never to have friends by way
of ceremony; I have them only with a view
to shew them my affection.</P>
<P>If ever I was fully and clearly convinced
of any thing, I am so convinced that Mr.
Hume furnished the materials for the above
paper.</P>
<P>But what is still more, I have not only
that absolute conviction, but it is very clear
to me that Mr. Hume intended I should:
For how can it be supposed that a man of
his subtlety should be so imprudent as to ex∣pose
himself thus, if he had not intended
it? What was his design in it? Nothing
is more clear than this. It was to raise my
resentment to the highest pitch, that he
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
might strike the blow he was preparing to
give me with greater eclat. He knew he
had nothing more to do than to put me in a
passion, and I should be guilty of a number
of absurdities. We are now arrived at the
critical moment which is to shew whether
he reasoned well or ill.</P>
<P>It is necessary to have all the presence of
mind, all the phlegm and resolution of Mr.
Hume, to be able to take the part he hath
taken, after all that has passed between us.
In the embarrassment I was under, in writing
to General Conway, I could make use only
of obscure expressions; to which Mr. Hume,
in quality of my friend, gave what inter∣pretation
he pleased. Supposing therefore,
for he knew very well to the contrary, that
it was the circumstance of secrecy which
gave me uneasiness, he obtained the promise
of the General to endeavour to remove it:
but before any thing was done, it was pre∣viously
necessary to know whether I would
accept of the pension without that condi∣tion,
in order not to expose his Majesty to a
second refusal.</P>
<P>This was the decisive moment, the end
and object of all his labours. An answer
was required; he would have it. To pre∣vent
effectually indeed my neglect of it, he
sent to Mr. Davenport a duplicate of his
letter to me; and, not content with this
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
precaution, wrote me word, in another
billet, that he could not possibly stay any
longer in London to serve me. I was giddy
with amazement, on reading this note. Ne∣ver
in my life did I meet with any thing so
unaccountable.</P>
<P>At length he obtained from me the so
much desired answer, and began presently to
triumph. In writing to Mr. Davenport, he
treated me as a monster of brutality and in∣gratitude.
But he wanted to do still more.
He thinks his measures well taken; no
proof can be made to appear against him.
He demands an explanation; he shall have
it, and here it is.</P>
<P>That last stroke was a master-piece. He
himself proves every thing, and that beyond
reply.</P>
<P>I will suppose, though by way of impos∣sibility,
that my complaints against Mr.
Hume never reached his ears; that he knew
nothing of them; but was as perfectly ig∣norant
as if he had held no cabal with those
who are acquainted with them, but had re∣sided
all the while in China<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How was it possible for me to guess at such chi∣merical suspicions? Mr. Davenport, the only person of my acquaintance who then saw Mr. Rousseau, assures me, that he was perfectly ignorant of them him∣self. <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>. Yet the be∣haviour
passing directly between us; the
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
last striking words, which I said to him in
London; the letter which followed replete
with fears and anxiety; my persevering silence
still more expressive than words; my public
and bitter complaints with regard to the let∣ter
of Mr. d'Alembert; my letter to the Se∣cretary
of State, who did not write to me,
in answer to that which Mr. Hume wrote to
me himself, and in which I did not mention
him; and in fine my refusal, without deign∣ing
to address myself to him, to acquiesce in
an affair which he had managed in my fa∣vour,
with my own privity, and without any
opposition on my part: all this must have
spoken in a very forcible manner, I will not
say to any person of the least sensibility, but
to every man of common sense.</P>
<P>Strange that, after I had ceased to corres∣pond
with him for three months, when I
had made no answer to any one of his letters,
however important the subject of it, sur∣rounded
with both public and private marks
of that affliction which his infidelity gave me;
a man of so enlightened an understanding,
of so penetrating a genius by nature, and so
dull by design, should see nothing, hear no∣thing,
feel nothing, be moved at nothing;
but, without one word of complaint, justi∣fication,
or explanation, continue to give me
the most pressing marks of his good will to
serve me, in spite of myself! He wrote to
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
me affectionately, that he could not stay
any longer in London to do me service, as if
we had agreed that he should stay there for
that purpose! This blindness, this insen∣sibility,
this perseverance, are not in nature;
they must be accounted for, therefore, from
other motives. Let us set this behaviour in a
still clearer light; for this is the decisive point.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume must necessarily have acted in
this affair, either as one of the first or last of
mankind. There is no medium. It remains
to determine which of the two it hath been.</P>
<P>Could Mr. Hume, after so many instances
of disdain on my part, have still the astonish∣ing
generosity as to persevere sincerely to
serve me? He knew it was impossible for me
to accept his good offices, so long as I enter∣tained
for him such sentiments as I had con∣ceived.
He had himself avoided an expla∣nation.
So that to serve me without justifying
himself, would have been to render his ser∣vices
useless; this therefore was no genero∣sity.
If he supposed that in such circumstances
I should have accepted his services, he must
have supposed me to have been an infamous
scoundrel. It was then in behalf of a man
whom he supposed to be a scoundrel, that
he so warmly solicited a pension from his Ma∣jesty.
Can any thing be supposed more ex∣travagant?</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85"/>
But let it be supposed that Mr. Hume,
constantly pursuing his plan, should only
have said to himself, This is the moment for
its execution; for, by pressing Rousseau to
accept the pension, he will be reduced either
to accept or refuse it. If he accepts it, with
the proofs I have in hand against him, I shall
be able compleatly to disgrace him: if he
refuses, after having accepted it, he will have
no pretext, but must give a reason for such
refusal. This is what I expect; if he ac∣cuses
me he is ruined.</P>
<P>If, I say, Mr. Hume reasoned with him∣self
in this manner, he did what was con∣sistent
with his plan, and in that case very
natural; indeed this is the only way in which
his conduct in this affair can be explained,
for upon any other supposition it is inexpli∣cable:
if this be not demonstrable, nothing
ever was so. The critical situation to which
he had now reduced me, recalled strongly to
my mind the four words I mentioned above;
and which I heard him say and repeat, at a
time when I did not comprehend their full
force. It was the first night after our de∣parture
from Paris. We slept in the same
chamber, when, during the night, I heard
him several times cry out with great vehe∣mence,
in the French language, <HI>Je tiens
J. J. Rousseau.</HI> [I have you, Rousseau.]
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
I know not whether he was awake or
asleep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot answer for every thing I may say in my sleep, and much less am I conscious whether or not I dream in French. But pray, as Mr. Rousseau did not know whether I was asleep or awake, when I pro∣nounced those terrible words, with such a terrible voice, how is he certain that he himself was well awake when he heard them? <BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The expression was remarkable, coming
from a man who is too well acquainted with
the French language, to be mistaken with
regard to the force or choice of words. I took
those words however, and I could not then
take them otherwise than in a favourable
sense: notwithstanding the tone of voice in
which they were spoken, was still less favour∣able
than the expression. It is indeed im∣possible
for me to give any idea of it; but it
corresponds exactly with those terrible looks
I have before mentioned. At every repeti∣tion
of them I was seized with a shuddering,
a kind of horror I could not resist; though a
moment's recollection restored me, and made
me smile at my terror. The next day all
this was so perfectly obliterated, that I did
not even once think of it during my stay in
London, and its neighbourhood. It was not
till my arrival in this place, that so many
things have contributed to recall these words
to mind; and indeed recall them every mo∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="87"/>
These words, the tone of which dwells on
my heart, as if I had but just heard them;
those long and fatal looks so frequently cast
on me; the patting me on the back, with
the repetition of <HI>O, my dear Sir,</HI> in an∣swer
to my suspicions of his being a trai∣tor:
all this affects me to such a degree,
after what preceded, that this recollection,
had I no other, would be sufficient to pre∣vent
any reconciliation or return of confi∣dence
between us; not a night indeed passes
over my head, but I think I hear, <HI>Rousseau,</HI>
<HI>I have you,</HI> ring in my ears as if he had
just pronounced them.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Hume, I know you <HI>have me</HI>;
but that only by mere externals: you have
me in the public opinion and judgment of
mankind. You have my reputation, and
perhaps my security, to do with as you will.
The general prepossession is in your favour;
it will be very easy for you to make me pass
for the monster you have begun to represent
me; and I already see the barbarous exulta∣tion
of my implacable enemies. The public
will no longer spare me. Without any far∣ther
examination, every body is on the side
of those who have conferred favours; because
each is desirous to attract the same good
offices, by displaying a sensibility of the obli∣gation.
I foresee readily the consequences
of all this, particularly in the country to
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
which you have conducted me; and where,
being without friends and an utter stranger
to every body, I lie almost entirely at your
mercy. The sensible part of mankind, how∣ever,
will comprehend that I must be so far
from seeking this affair, that nothing more
disagreeable or terrible could possibly have
happened to me in my present situation.
They will perceive that nothing but my in∣vincible
aversion to all kind of falshood, and
the possibility of my professing a regard for a
person who had forfeited it, could have pre∣vented
my dissimulation, at a time when it
was on so many accounts my interest. But
the sensible part of mankind are few, nor do
they make the greatest noise in the world.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Hume, you <HI>have me</HI> by all the
ties of this life; but you have no power over
my probity or my fortitude, which, being
independent either of you or of mankind, I
will preserve in spite of you. Think not to
frighten me with the fortune that awaits me.
I know the opinions of mankind; I am ac∣customed
to their injustice, and have learned
to care little about it. If you have taken
your resolution, as I have reason to believe
you have, be assured mine is taken also. I
am feeble indeed in body, but never possessed
greater strength of mind.</P>
<P>Mankind may say and do what they will,
it is of little consequence to me. What is of
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
consequence, however, is, that I should end
as I have begun; that I should continue to
preserve my ingenuousness and integrity to
the end, whatever may happen; and that I
should have no cause to reproach myself
either with meanness in adversity, or inso∣lence
in prosperity. Whatever disgrace at∣tends,
or misfortune threatens me, I am
ready to meet them. Though I am to be
pitied, I am much less so than you, and all
the revenge I shall take on you, is, to leave
you the tormenting consciousness of being
obliged, in spite of yourself, to have a respect
for the unfortunate person you have op∣pressed.</P>
<P>In closing this letter, I am surprized at
my having been able to write it. If it were
possible to die with grief, every line was suf∣ficient
to kill me with sorrow. Every cir∣cumstance
of the affair is equally incompre∣hensible.
Such conduct as yours hath been,
is not in nature: it is contradictory to itself,
and yet it is demonstrable to me that it has
been such as I conceive. On each side of me
there is a bottomless abyss! and I am lost in
one or the other.</P>
<P>If you are guilty, I am the most unfor∣tunate
of mankind; if you are innocent, I
am the most culpable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And does it depend on an <HI>if,</HI> after all Mr. R's positive conviction, and absolute demonstrations? <BIBL><HI>English trans.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>. You even make
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
me desire to be that contemptible object.
Yes, the situation to which you see me re∣duced,
prostrate at your feet, crying out for
mercy, and doing every thing to obtain it;
publishing aloud my own unworthiness, and
paying the most explicit homage to your vir∣tues,
would be a state of joy and cordial ef∣fusion,
after the grievous state of restraint
and mortification into which you have plung∣ed
me. I have but a word more to say. If
you are guilty, write to me no more; it
would be superfluous, for certainly you could
not deceive me. If you are innocent, justify
yourself. I know my duty, I love, and
shall always love it, however difficult and
severe. There is no state of abjection that a
heart, not formed for it, may not recover
from. Once again, I say, if you are innocent,
deign to justify yourself; if you are not,
adieu for ever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I hesitated some time whether I should
make any reply to this strange memorial.
At length I determined to write to Mr. Rous∣seau
the following letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
<HEAD>Mr. HUME to Mr. ROUSSEAU.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Lisle-street, Leicester-fields, <DATE>July 22, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHALL only answer one article of
your long letter: it is that which regards
the conversation between us the evening be∣fore
your departure. Mr. Davenport had
imagined a good natured artifice, to make you
believe that a retour chaise had offered for
Wooton; and I believe he made an adver∣tisement
be put in the papers, in order the
better to deceive you. His purpose only was
to save you some expences in the journey,
which I thought a laudable project; though
I had no hand either in contriving or con∣ducting
it. You entertained, however, sus∣picions
of his design, while we were sitting
alone by my fire-side; and you reproached
me with concurring in it. I endeavoured to
pacify you, and to divert the discourse; but
to no purpose. You sat sullen, and was
either silent, or made me very peevish an∣swers.
At last you rose up, and took a turn
or two about the room; when all of a sud∣den,
and to my great surprise, you clapped
yourself on my knee, threw your arms about
my neck, kissed me with seeming ardour,
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
and bedewed my face with tears. You ex∣claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, can you ever
pardon this folly! After all the pains you
have taken to serve me, after the num∣berless
instances of friendship you have
given me, here I reward you with this ill
humour and sullenness. But your for∣giveness
of me will be a new instance of
your friendship; and I hope you will find
at bottom, that my heart is not unwor∣thy
of it."</Q></P>
<P>I was very much affected, I own; and,
I believe, there passed a very tender scene
between us. You added, by way of com∣pliment,
that though I had many better titles
to recommend me to posterity, yet perhaps
my uncommon attachment and friendship to
a poor unhappy persecuted man, would not
altogether be overlooked.</P>
<P>This incident, Sir, was somewhat remark∣able;
and it is impossible that either you or I
could so soon have forgot it. But you have
had the assurance to tell me the story twice
in a manner so different, or rather so oppo∣site,
that when I persist, as I do, in this ac∣count,
it necessarily follows, that either you
or I are a liar. You imagine, perhaps, that
because the incident passed privately without
a witness, the question will lie between the
credibility of your assertion and of mine. But
you shall not have this advantage or disad∣vantage,
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
which ever you are pleased to term
it. I shall produce against you other proofs,
which will put the matter beyond controversy.</P>
<P>First, You are not aware, that I have a
letter under your hand, which is totally irre∣concilable
with your account, and confirms
mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That of the 22d of March, which is entirely cor∣dial; and proves that Mr. Rousseau had never, till that moment, entertained, or at least discovered, the smallest suspicion against me. There is also in the same letter, a peevish passage about the hire of a chaise.
<BIBL>Mr. HUME.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Secondly, I told the story the next day, or
the day after, to Mr. Davenport, with a
friendly view of preventing any such good
natured artifices for the future. He surely
remembers it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As I thought the story much to
your honour, I told it to several of my friends
here. I even wrote it to Mde. de Boufflers
at Paris. I believe no one will imagine, that
I was preparing before-hand an apology, in
case of a rupture with you; which, of all
human events, I should then have thought
the most incredible, especially as we were
separated almost for ever, and I still conti∣nued
to render you the most essential services.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The story, as I tell it, is con∣sistent
and rational: there is not common
sense in your account. What! because
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
sometimes, when absent in thought, I have
a fixed look or stare, you suspect me to be a
traitor, and you have the assurance to tell
me of such black and ridiculous suspicions!
Are not most studious men (and many of
them more than I) subject to such reveries or
fits of absence, without being exposed to
such suspicions? You do not even pretend
that, before you left London, you had any
other solid grounds of suspicion against me.</P>
<P>I shall enter into no detail with regard to
your letter: the other articles of it are as much
without foundation as you yourself know
this to be. I shall only add, in general, that
I enjoyed about a month ago an uncommon
pleasure, when I reflected, that through
many difficulties, and by most assiduous care
and pains, I had, beyond my most sanguine
expectations, provided for your repose, ho∣nour
and fortune. But I soon felt a very
sensible uneasiness when I found that you had
wantonly and voluntarily thrown away all
these advantages, and was become the de∣clared
enemy of your own repose, fortune,
and honour: I cannot be surprized after this
that you are my enemy. Adieu, and for
ever. I am, Sir, yours.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To all these papers, I need only subjoin
the following letter of Mr. Walpole to me,
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
which proves how ignorant and innocent I
am of the whole matter of the King of Prus∣sia's
letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>Mr. WALPOLE to Mr. HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Arlington Street, <DATE>July 26, 1766.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT be precise as to the time of
my writing the King of Prussia's letter, but
I do assure you, with the utmost truth, that
it was several days before you left Paris, and
before Rousseau's arrival there, of which I
can give you a strong proof; for I not only
suppressed the letter while you staid there,
out of delicacy to you, but it was the reason
why, out of delicacy to myself, I did not go
to see him, as you often proposed to me;
thinking it wrong to go and make a cordial
visit to a man, with a letter in my pocket to
laugh at him. You are at full liberty, dear
Sir, to make use of what I say in your justi∣fication,
either to Rousseau or any body else.
I should be very sorry to have you blamed
on my account: I have a hearty contempted
of Rousseau, and am perfectly indifferent
what any body thinks of the matter. If
there is any fault, which I am far from
thinking, let it lie on me. No parts can
hinder my laughing at their possessor, if he
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
is a mountebank. If he has a bad and most
ungrateful heart, as Rousseau has shown in
your case, into the bargain, he will have my
scorn likewise, as he will of all good and sen∣sible
men. You may trust your sentence to
such, who are as respectable judges as any that
have pored over ten thousand more volumes.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours most sincerely,
H. W.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus I have given a narrative, as concise
as possible, of this extraordinary affair, which
I am told has very much attracted the atten∣tion
of the public, and which contains more
unexpected incidents than any other in which
I was ever engaged. The persons to whom
I have shown the original papers which au∣thenticate
the whole, have differed very much
in their opinion, as well of the use I ought
to make of them as of Mr. Rousseau's pre∣sent
sentiments and state of mind. Some of
them have maintained, that he is altogether
insincere in his quarrel with me, and his
opinion of my guilt, and that the whole pro∣ceeds
from that excessive pride which forms
the basis of his character, and which leads
him both to seek the eclat of refusing the
King of England's bounty, and to shake off
the intolerable burthen of an obligation to
me, by every sacrifice of honour, truth, and
friendship, as well as of interest. They
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
found their sentiments on the absurdity of
that first supposition on which he grounds
his anger, viz. that Mr. Walpole's letter,
which he knew had been every where dis∣persed
both in Paris and London, was given
to the press by me; and as this supposition
is contrary to common sense on the one hand,
and not supported even by the pretence of
the slightest probability on the other, they
conclude, that it never had any weight even
with the person himself who lays hold of it.
They confirm their sentiments by the number
of fictions and lies, which he employs to jus∣tify
his anger; fictions with regard to points,
in which it is impossible for him to be mis∣taken.
They also remark his real chearful∣ness
and gaiety, amidst the deep melancholy
with which he pretended to be oppressed.
Not to mention the absurd reasoning which
runs through the whole, and on which it is
impossible for any man to rest his conviction;
and though a very important interest is here
abandoned, yet money is not universally the
chief object with mankind; vanity weighs
farther with some men, particularly with this
philosopher; and the very oftentation of re∣fusing
a pension from the King of England,
an ostentation which, with regard to other
Princes, he has often sought, might be of
itself a sufficient motive for his present con∣duct.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="98"/>
There are others of my friends, who re∣gard
this whole affair in a more compas∣sionate
light, and consider Mr. Rousseau as
an object rather of pity than of anger.
They suppose the same domineering pride
and ingratitude to be the basis of his cha∣racter;
but they are also willing to believe,
that his brain has received a sensible shock,
and that his judgment, set afloat, is carried to
every side, as it is pushed by the current of
his humours and of his passions. The ab∣surdity
of his belief is no proof of its in∣sincerity.
He imagines himself the sole im∣portant
being in the universe: he fancies all
mankind to be in a combination against him:
his greatest benefactor, as hurting him most,
is the chief object of his animosity: and
though he supports all his whimsies by
lies and fictions, this is so frequent a case
with wicked men, who are in that middle
state between sober reason and total frenzy,
that it needs give no surprize to any body.</P>
<P>I own that I am much inclined to this lat∣ter
opinion; though, at the same time, I
question whether, in any period of his life,
Mr. Rousseau was ever more in his senses
than he is at present. The former brilliancy
of his genius, and his great talents for
writing, are no proof of the contrary. It
is an old remark, that great wits are near
allied to madness; and even in those frantic
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
letters which he has wrote to me, there are
evidently strong traces of his wonted genius
and eloquence. He has frequently told me,
that he was composing his memoirs, in
which justice should be done to his own
character, to that of his friends, and to that
of his enemies; and as Mr. Davenport in∣forms
me that since his retreat into the coun∣try,
he has been much employed in writing,
I have reason to conclude that he is at pre∣sent
finishing that undertaking. Nothing
could be more unexpected to me than my
passing so suddenly from the class of his
friends to that of his enemies; but this
transition being made, I must expect to be
treated accordingly; and I own that this re∣flection
gave me some anxiety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In his letter of the 22d of March, he flatters me indirectly with the figure I am to make in his Memoirs; in that of the 23d of June, he threatens me. These are proofs how much he is in earnest.</NOTE>. A work
of this nature, both from the celebrity of
the person, and the strokes of eloquence in∣terspersed,
would certainly attract the atten∣tion
of the world; and it might be pub∣lished
either after my death, or after that
of the author. In the former case, there
would be no body who could tell the story,
or justify my memory. In the latter, my
apology, wrote in opposition to a dead per∣son,
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
would lose a great deal of its authenti∣city.
For this reason, I have at present col∣lected
the whole story into one Narrative,
that I may show it to my friends, and at any
time have it in my power to make whatever
use of it they and I should think proper. I
am, and always have been, such a lover of
peace, that nothing but necessity, or very
forcible reasons, could have obliged me to
give it to the public.</P>

<HEAD>DECLARATION of Mr. D'ALEMBERT,
relating to Mr. Walpole's Letter.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Addressed to the French Editors.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with the greatest surprize I learn,
from Mr. Hume, that Mr. Rousseau ac∣cuses
me of being the author of the ironical
letter addressed to him, in the public papers,
under the name of the King of Prussia.
Every body knows, both at Paris and Lon∣don,
that such letter was written by Mr.
Walpole; nor does he disown it. He ac∣knowleges
only that he was a little assisted
in regard to the stile, by a person he does
not name, and whom perhaps he ought to
name. As to my part, on whom the pub∣lic
suspicions have fallen in this affair, I am
not at all acquainted with Mr. Walpole:
I don't even believe I ever spoke to him;
having only happened to meet once occa∣sionally
on a visit.—I have not only had not
the least to do, either directly or indirectly,
with the letter in question, but could mention
above an hundred persons, among the friends
as well as enemies of Mr. Rousseau, who
have heard me greatly disapprove of it; be∣cause,
as I said, we ought not to ridicule the
unfortunate, especially when they do us no
<PB N="95" REF="102"/>
harm. Besides, my respect for the King of
Prussia, and the acknowledgments I owe
him, might, I should have thought, have
persuaded Mr. Rousseau, that I should not
have taken such a liberty with the name of
that prince, even tho' in pleasantry.</P>
<P>To this I shall add, that I never was an
enemy to Mr. Rousseau, either open or se∣cret,
as he pretends; and I defy him to
produce the least proof of my having en∣deavoured
to injure him in any shape what∣ever.
I can prove to the contrary, by the
most respectable witnesses, that I have al∣ways
endeavoured to oblige him, whenever
it lay in my power.</P>
<P>As to my pretended <HI>secret correspondence</HI>
with Mr. Hume, it is very certain, that we
did not begin to write to each other till about
five or six months after his departure, on
occasion of the quarrel arisen between him
and Mr. Rousseau, and into which the lat∣ter
thought proper unnecessarily to intro∣duce
me.</P>
<P>I thought this declaration necessary, for
my own sake, as well as for the sake of
truth, and in regard to the situation of Mr.
Rousseau: I sincerely lament his having so
little confidence in the probity of mankind,
and particularly in that of Mr. Hume.</P>
