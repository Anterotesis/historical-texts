<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> COMMONWEALTH is a
Machine actuated by many
Wheels, one dependant on the
other, yet the Obstruction of
a small Wheel may stop the
Motion of the whole: Every Man ought
therefore as much as in him lies, to con∣tribute
in his Station, to the publick Wel∣fare,
and not be afraid or ashamed of
doing, or at least, meaning well.</P>
<P>I hope therefore the Reader will excuse
the Vanity of an over officious <HI>Old Man,</HI>
if like <HI>Cato,</HI> I enquire whether or no be∣fore
<PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
I go hence and be no more, I can yet
do any thing for the Service of my Country.</P>
<P>For if every Man should say Children
are burthensome, and the Cause of many
Sorrows, therefore will not I be a Father,
farewel to all Ties of Nature, and
every Blessing of human Society.</P>
<P>Or if every Man should say to himself,
what have I to do with State Affairs?
is it my Business? are there not enough
at the Helm? what need I interfere? Let
me be subject to the Higher Powers, and
let Matters sink or swim, I shall have
Neighbours Fare.</P>
<P>Would not this be a very churlish Reso∣lution?
would it not very much contri∣bute
to universal Anarchy and Confusion?
should every Man thus throw the Care of
the Publick from his shoulders, and acquit
himself of any Concern for the rest of
Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="6"/>
This would be my Case, should I, know∣ing
I am Master of a Project, which in
all probability, may be of great use to
Mankind, reason thus to my self; what
have I to do to divulge my Secrets?
What though they are of Benefit to the
Publick, shall I reap any Advantage by
them? Shall I not rather be laugh'd at and
despised as a Projector, the most contemp∣tible
Character in this Part of the World?
May not another run away with the Profits
of my Labour, and by a little Improve∣ment
make my Project his own? is it not
better for me to repose myself, to die in
Peace, and leave an ungrateful World to
their own Imaginations? <HI>Non nobis nati
sumus.</HI> That Thought would quash all harsh
Contemplations, I could hazard with
Pleasure, the publick Contumely for the
publick Good, knowing it has been the Fate
of much better Men than my self, to be
despised when living, tho' rever'd when
dead.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
Prompted by this Reflection, I once more
take Pen in Hand, as I hope for the Ser∣vice
of my Country: If my Countrymen
find what I advance practicable, I hope
they will not call my Integrity in question.
and if they have patience to read my well
intended Thoughts, tho' digested I fear but
too mildly, and in too mean a Stile, I hope
they will find I have advanc'd nothing
but what is practicable, beneficial, and
without Self-Interest; having excluded my∣self
from any propriety in my own Pro∣ject,
by thus publishing it and making it
every Body's: and if any think I write
for Money, let them ask my Bookseller.</P>
<P>Alas I have but small Health and
little Leisure to turn Author, being now
in my 67<HI>th</HI> Year, almost worn out with
Age and Sickness. The <HI>Old Man</HI> cannot
trouble you long; take then in good part
his best Intentions, and impute his De∣fects
to Age and Weakness: Look on
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
him as a Man of more Experience than
Learning; excuse his Stile for the sake of
his Subject, and take the Will for the
Deed. Assure your self, gentle Reader,
I had not published my Project in this Pam∣phlet,
could I have got it inserted in any
of the Journals, without Feeing the Jour∣nalists
or Publishers.</P>
<P>I cannot but have the Vanity to think,
they might as well have inserted what
I sent them, <HI>Gratis,</HI> as many Things I
have since seen in their Papers. But I
have not only had the Mortification to
find what I sent rejected, but to lose my
Originals, not having taken Copies of what
I wrote.</P>
<P>However, to justify my Complaints to
the World, I shall, in a proper Place, let
them know the Substance of what was
rejected, and by whom.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
In the mean time, give me leave to as∣sure
my Readers, that the Reason why
this Project appears in a Pamphlet is, be∣cause
I have been thus baffled and dis∣heartened
by Journalists; for if by any
Means the Publick could have had it at a
cheaper Rate, I had been better pleased.</P>

<HEAD>THE
Protestant Monastery.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is nothing on Earth
more shocking, and withal more
common, in but too many Fami∣lies,
than to see Age and Grey
Hairs derided, and ill used. The OLD
MAN or the OLD WOMAN, can do
nothing to please; their Words are per∣verted,
their Actions misrepresented, and
themselves look'd upon as a Burthen to
their Issue, and a Rent Charge upon those
who came from their Loins.</P>
<P>This Treatment, as it is directly oppo∣site
to the Dignity and Decency of Human
Nature, calls aloud for Redress; the Help∣less
and innocent ought to be the care
of the Healthy and able. Shall a Man or
Woman toil and moil to bring up a nu∣merous
Issue? shall they rear up, thro' all
the Uncertainties and Fatigues of Child∣hood,
a Race who shall spring up but to
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
abandon them? shall they enfeeble them∣selves
to give Strength to those who shall
one Day thrust them aside, and despise them?</P>
<P>Yet this is the Case of many aged Per∣sons,
who have outlived the Comforts of
this World; who survive only to hear them∣selves
wish'd out of the way, by those
very Persons upon whom they have be∣stowed
their whole Substance, and upon
whom their whole Hopes have been fixed.
Uncertain Hopes indeed! and far unfit for so
degenerate an Age. <HI>Honour thy Father
and thy Mother</HI> is a Commandment given
by God, and ratified by our Blessed Savi∣our,
both in Precept and Example; If so,
what Brutes are those who shall dare to
spurn those Persons whom God has thought
fit to make the Means of their Entrance
into human Life?</P>
<P>But indeed, not only Parents, but all a∣ged
People in general, are thought to stand
in the way of the present Generation: and
but for some good Children, some Persons
of Tenderness and Humanity, who honour
the hoary Head, and comfort the Feeble;
immediate Vengeance would be pulled
down on those who let not their Sires
live out half their Days.</P>
<P>The Word OLD is a standing Jest a∣mong
our youthful Gentry. When they
would frighten Children, they tell them
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
<HI>The old Man's a coming:</HI> Thus they in∣culcate
an Abhorrence of Age, even in
sucking Babes; which no doubt will im∣prove
with adult Age, according to the Proverb;
<Q><L>Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem</L><L>Testa diu.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF any whimsical or ridiculous Story is
told, 'tis of an <HI>Old Woman.</HI> If any Per∣son
is aukward at his Business, or any
thing else, he is called an <HI>Old Woman,</HI>
forsooth; But this is no new thing, for
we read in former Ages, that they made
Witches of their Old Women. Those
were brave Days for young People, when
they could swear the old Ones out of
their Lives! and get a Woman hanged or
burnt only for being a little too old; as
has been the Case of many a poor inno∣cent
ancient Creature. The Story of the
Witch, <HI>alias,</HI> the poor Old Woman of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> is yet fresh in every one's Me∣mory;
and had not the very Judges on the
Bench seen through the Enthusiasm and
Obstinacy of the Evidence, who swore tho∣rough
thick and thin: had not the Judges
themselves, I say, represented the thing in a
right Light to the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> poor
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
<HI>Jane Wenman</HI> had certainly been truss'd up;
as a Warning to all ancient Perfons, who
should dare to live longer than the young
Ones think convenient.</P>
<P>It is well it has never been in the young
Ones Power, to bring in a Bill for the bet∣ter
trimming of Mankind, <HI>i. e.</HI> to knock
all ancient People on the Head.</P>
<P>But though they are suffered to live, 'tis
under many Hardships and Restrictions,
many Humps and Grumps; and scarce a
Day, but they are ask'd, what they do out
of their Graves. This is a very common,
but withal, a most impious and unchristian
Saying; nay, not only unchristian, but even
unmahometan: For the very Infidels them∣selves
pay more Veneration to old Age,
than the Christians do; to the Shame and
Scandal of our Holy Profession.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, to tax all Christians,
or all Children with so severe a Reproach.
No, I only blame those who triumph
in the Strength of their Youth, and
snuff up their Nostrils at <HI>Old-Age:</HI> Who
laugh at the Groanings of the hoary Head,
and have no Bowels of Compassion for the
Bowels that gave them Nourishment.</P>
<P>Let such self-sufficient Persons consider,
that it was once in their Parents Power to
have abandoned them, when they were more
helpless than any other Being to which
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
God had given Life. When they must
inevitably have perished, without great
Care and Tenderness: and indeed the Di∣vine
Wisdom is most manifestly seen, in mak∣ing
Man, the Chief of all his earthly Crea∣tures,
to require so delicate a Management,
and so tender a Nourishment: parental Love
being encreas'd by its Care, as filial Love
ought to be, by a Gratitude for that Care
it can never too much acknowledge or re∣pay.</P>
<P>All
Creatures whom God has ordained to
quit their Sires, or indeed those whom he
has not endow'd with a rational Soul, to
distinguish between good and bad, or to
know Duty or Obligation, are easily brought
up, and can help themselves better the
Hour they are born, than Man can in a
whole Year, nay in Years. They perform
all the necessary Functions of Life, and
there is no need of Education. Far other∣wise
is it with Man; he in his Infancy re∣quires
a constant and careful Attendance,
his Members know not their Functions,
and it is a long while before he can feed
himself, even then his Parents have the Care
for his Food. When the Body is duly
nourished, there is yet a further Care to
form the Mind, and cultivate the rational
Soul God had endow'd him with.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="15"/>
Shall such a Being, possest of a rational
Soul, to distinguish between Good and Bad,
between Gratitude and Ingratitude, so far
debase himself, or indeed become so
much a Brute, as to forsake his Parent, to
spurn him who begot him? or at least, by
using him ill, to elbow him as it were out
of the World, to give himself the greater
Scope for Luxury?</P>
<P>Yet how many do we see of such? how
many truly compassionate Hearts daily
bleed, when they see the Son curbing the Fa∣ther,
or the Daughter snubbing the Mother?
It seems as if the Order of Nature were per∣verted:
So shocking is it to any Soul who
has the least Tincture of Humanity.</P>
<P>I am sure I speak by Experience: for but
very lately I went to see an old School-Fel∣low
and Acquaintance of mine, who had
lately married his Daughter, and settled
himself in her Family; accordingly he gave
me a general Invitation to come one Day or
other and take a Dinner with him; he had
been a Merchant from his Youth, and al∣ways
liv'd in what we call high Life, had
travell'd much, and was Master of the most
good Manners I ever met with.</P>
<P>This Gentleman being very weary, and in∣deed
almost incapable of Business, thought it
best to leave off House keeping, to marry his
Daughter, and settle in her Family. Ac∣cordingly
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
he gave her his All for her
Portion, made her a Fortune of 12000
Pounds, and match'd her to an eminent
Merchant, who us'd the same Trade with
himself.</P>
<P>During the Honey-Moon, and till the
Portion was paid, the Old Gentleman liv'd
in Clover; nothing was too hot or too hea∣vy
for him. 'Twas <HI>Dear Sir! Dear Father!</HI>
at every Word; the Servants were ordered
to respect him, and he was in some Share
Master of the Family; but alas! he found
this but a short-liv'd Dream, the Servants be∣gan
to taunt at him, and he must call twen∣ty
Times for a thing, before he could have
it. If he gently chid 'em, or reason'd with
them, they flew to their Mistress, and made
twenty Stories about it: so that his Life
was in a manner a Burthen to him.</P>
<P>I went in my Chariot to see him; and
had not the little Appearance I made, com∣manded
fome respect, I had danc'd Atten∣dance,
till they should find in their Hearts
to call him. However, without much
Ceremony, they directed me up three pair
of Stairs, into a better sort of a Garret;
there might be indeed some Lodging-Rooms
over Head for the Servants; but I have
seen many Servants have much better Ap∣partments:
but the Room would not
have so much surpriz'd me, had the Fur∣niture
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
been any thing tollerable. I dare
swear it was as old as the House, and had
no doubt pass'd from Tenant to Tenant
half a score Times.</P>
<P>This I thought an odd Residence for my
Friend, but he seem'd contented; and I
saw no Reason I had to make him other∣wise.
He amused me till Dinner time,
with shewing me his Books, and reading
some of his Verses to me, as having a pret∣ty
Knack that way: he would have play'd
me a Lesson on his Flute, but that he said
it would disturb his Daughter, who did not
love Musick. I saw that all his little Arts
were only to beguile the Time, lest a Whet
before Dinner, which I never mist at his
House, should be expected; and which I be∣lieve
was now out of his Power to give. At
last the Bell rang, and he desired me to walk
down to Dinner, but with an Air that
seem'd chidingly to say, Ah! why did you
not come sooner, when I had more Autho∣rity:
However, with a long Apology to his
Son and Daughter, he introduced me; and
by pleading our long and intimate Acquin∣tance,
and the Obligations he was under to
me; he prevail'd on them at last to bid me
a very ceremonious Welcome. Excusing
themselves, as indeed they had need, that
they had not made a proper Provision; and
pleading their Ignorance of my coming,
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
accordingly down we sate to, some cold
Roast-Beef, a few Herrings, and a Plate of
Fritters. Every thing was indeed very clean,
and we had Attendance enough, but never
in my Life made I a worse Dinner. Herrings
are my aversion, I never eat cold Meat, judge
then what a Belly full I could make of my
share of the Fritters. I happened by Mistake
to call for a Glass of Wine, without which
I never dine, when the Gentleman told me
he had none in the House; but if I pleas'd
he would send for some, recommending at
the same time some of his Home-brew'd
Ale, which I in Complaisance could not
but accept in Preference to Wine. They
took me at my Word, and with much ado
I got down half a Glass of the worst Po∣tion
I ever took in my Life, but had the
Dinner been never so elegant, my indigna∣tion
would have spoil'd my Stomach; to
hear the Daughter at every turn, take up
her Father in his Discourse, as if he had
been an Idiot or an underling, with <HI>Oh! fye
Sir,</HI> and <HI>I wonder Father you should say so!</HI>
But lest the Readers, by my Recital of the
Lady's Phrases, should think my Friend
spake ludicrously or indecently, I beg
Leave to assure them the contrary, and that
he is a Man of great Wit and strict Mo∣desty.
Even the Son who was the least Severe
upon him, could not refrain contradicting
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
him every now and then, meerly for con∣tradiction
sake, with, <HI>Pray, Sir, give me
Leave,</HI> and <HI>indeed, Sir, you have forgot your
self;</HI> this was my whole Entertainment:
For my Part I said little, but admired not
only at this wondrous Frugality, but the
surprizing Impertinence and Ingratitude of
of the young Couple. However, I was
undeceived at last, as I hope my Readers
will be when I assure them, that the Rea∣son
why <HI>Sir</HI> and <HI>Madam,</HI> eat so sparingly
with us was, because they had devour'd in
Hugger Mugger by themselves, a good
handsome Fowl, and Oyster Sauce, and dis∣pens'd
with a Bottle of Wine, though they
could drink none in our Company.</P>
<P>Seeing this penurious Management, and
the Awe my poor Friend was in, I thought
it best to adjourn to the Tavern to smoak a
Pipe, and withal to take a Glass to warm
my Stomach, which rak'd prodigiously. I
had before learn'd that the poor old Soul
had been oblig'd to leave off Smoaking,
because forsooth his spitting and spawling
turn'd <HI>Madam</HI>'s Stomach; his smoaking
she said, made the House stink, and damag∣ed
the Furniture. He had been from his
Youth a great Smoaker, and this sudden
Check, upon a Habit of so long standing,
had very much impair'd his Health.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20"/>
Accordingly to the Tavern we went; where
a Pipe and a Bottle gave new Life to my old
Acquaintance; he resum'd his native Gayety;
and eleven of the Clock stole upon us, be∣fore
we could think of Parting, and even
then but with great Reluctance; so agreea∣bly
did the Time pass away in recounting
our old Adventures. Indeed our sweet was
intermix'd with sour, for his poor Heart was
so full, he could not contain himself from
lodging his Sorrows in the Bosom of his old
Friend. With Tears in his Eyes, he recount∣ed
all the Indignities he daily met with, not
only from his own Children, but from the
very Servants. If he spake to them as to Ser∣vants,
his Daughter would take him up,
and tell him he domineer'd too much in
her House: If he spake submissively, he
was told he had no occasion to make him∣self
so little; insomuch that he knew not
what Medium to take.</P>
<P>He told me his Daughter had lately a
Chamber-Maid, who was the Daughter of
a decay'd Gentleman, and who having had
a tolerable Education, had imbib'd high
Notions of Virtue; and amongst other
things, an Abhorrence of undutifulness in
Children, or indeed any disrespect in old
Age. This young Woman having learn'd
in what Fashion my Friend had once liv'd,
could not without Indignation, see how ill
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
he was treated: and being of a good Fami∣ly
her self, scorn'd to take Part with the o∣ther
Servants, to torment a poor old Man;
but on the contrary, would do him all the
Christian Offices she could, would constant∣ly
get him something warm in a Morning,
and if he was out of Order at any time,
would tend him, and do him a thousand
little Services, for which he in Recompence,
when her Lady was gone a Visiting, would
read to the Girl a whole Afternoon to∣gether,
while she sat at Work. And as so
many good Offices must consequently en∣gage
her to him, especially when every Bo∣dy
else had abandon'd him, he, with an
innocent Familiarity, us'd to call her his
<HI>Nanny:</HI> This was taken in great Dudgeon,
and the spiteful Servants improv'd it into an
Intrigue, and never left till poor <HI>Nanny</HI>
was turn'd away; and with her all the old
Man's Comfort; for he had no warm Break∣fast
now, if he was Sick, there he might
lie, for no body would help him; and as
for Attendance, they neglected him so
much, he was scarce clean, which drew
Tears from my Eyes, as knowing what a
neat old Man he was us'd to be. And but
for disgracing his Children, he wish'd him∣self
a thousand Times in the <HI>Charter-House,</HI>
or some other Place of publick Charity: I
dissuaded him from such Thoughts, and
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
comforted him in the best Manner I could;
and so we both parted and ended our plea∣sant
Evening, with heavy Hearts and wet
Eyes.</P>
<P><HI>About a Week after, by the</HI> Penny-post<HI>,
I receiv'd the following Letter.</HI></P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I shall carry to my
Grave the agreeable Rememb∣rance
of ourlast Meeting, I believe I
shall suffer to my dying Day for that
Night's Pleasure. Your engaging Com∣pany,
and my long Abstinence from
Wine, made me, I think, drink a little
too much; and tho' not to disguise my
self, as you I hope might well perceive,
yet more than my Age and Weakness
cou'd well bear. My Daughter, who
seldom or never comes Home before
Midnight, took Care to be at Home that
very Night before Nine a-Clock; and
at Ten she sent all the Family to Bed,
and sate up for me her self, out of mere
Spight and pure Intention to rattle me
off; which she did with a Ven∣geance,
crying out shame of such Hours;
telling me I was drunk: and when I
complain'd of sickness at my Stomach,
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
she said it was good enough for me.
This you may conclude made me worse.
I thought I should have died, and had
not I eas'd my Stomach, I had not sur∣viv'd
that Moment. This put her be∣yond
all Patience, and instead of pity∣ing
her almost Dying Father, she called
me (would you believe it!) she called
me <HI>Old Beast;</HI> and used me in such a Man∣ner
as has riv'd my very Heart; Nor is
this all, for ever since I am become the
Jest of the whole Family: they call
me <HI>Old Fool,</HI> and <HI>drunken old Beast</HI>
to my Face, and every Visitor that
comes in, is told what a Sot I am; so
that I keep my Chamber, and dare not
show my Head about the House; but I
thank God, who has heard my Prayers,
that I hourly find my self weaker and
weaker, and I doubt not but my long wish∣ed
for Dissolution is near at hand; for all the
Torments of a lingering Death are Trifles
to the Usage I meet with. <HI>Dear Friend,</HI>
let me see you once more before I dye, hav∣ing
some Manuscripts, and a few other
Trifles to give you in Remembrance of
our old Friendship; which alas! is all
I can give to the only Friend I have
left on this side the Grave.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Affectionate Friend.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="15" REF="24"/>FOR the sake of the young Lady, to
whom God grant a speedy Repentance,
I forbear subscribing even the initial Let∣ters
of her Father's Name; that the World
may not know how good a Man she has
murthered: For her Usage was such, that
before I could find Opportunity to visit
him according to his Desire, I was pre∣vented
by a Ticket, which invited me to
hold up his Pall, which more surpriz'd
than afflicted me, as knowing the miserable
Life, he lead under his most unnatural
Daughter.</P>
<Q>Quis talia fando temperet a Lachrymis?</Q>
<P>The burying was of a Piece with the
rest; and I hope the whole will be a Warn∣ing
to all aged Persons, and teach 'em to re∣serve
at least wherewithal to maintain them∣selves
elsewhere, in Case of the like Usage
from their Children or Relations.</P>
<P>I hope, at the same time, it will be a
Looking Glass to young People, especially
those guilty of the like Actions. If they
see any thing ugly in this Lady's Charact∣er,
let them not be so over good natured
to their own Persons, as to think what is
a Crime in her, may be excusable in
themselves: No, the Sin is the same, let
who will commit it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25"/>
To do as we would be done by, one
would think a sufficient Restraint upon any,
who would give themselves the least time to
consider, that they in all probability may
be Fathers and Mothers; and that though
they are young and healthy now, they may
be old and feeble hereafter. Let them
therefore use the Old as they could wish to
be us'd when they are so, and let them
be as tender of their Parents, as they wou'd
have their Posterity tender of them.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, we bring up our
Youth, as it were to despise us; and to our
shame be it spoken, make Rods for our
selves: Every one indulges his own Chil∣dren,
and so all act with Impunity. Our
Youth are not half educated, nor are they
under any Restraint; we make Men and
Women of them too soon, and put 'em up∣on
a footing with our selves, before they
have well learned good Manners, or indeed
any thing else.</P>
<P>For good Manners does not altogether
consist in a formal Courtesy or Bow, in
coming in and going out of a Room: No,
a Man may behave himself most punctually
Ceremonious at a Ball, a drawing Room,
a Tea-Table, or indeed in any other fiddle
faddle part of Life; and yet for all this be
but a Man of Clouts, a meer <HI>Sir-courtly-Nice.</HI>
I have very often seen some of these
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
well dress'd, well bred Gentlemen, <HI>alias</HI>
Hobbydehoy's have Assurance enough to
stare a whole Coffee-Room out of Counte∣nance;
but neither Sense or Learning
sufficient to give any Man of Parts a rea∣sonable
Answer.</P>
<P>No, the Satchel is too soon taken from
the shoulders of our young sparks, and the
Rod from their Backsides; the Tye-Wig
and Sword are too soon put on, and lit∣tle
Master is made a Man before he
is a well-grown Child; our little Girls,
through the Indulgence of their Mothers,
are yet more forward, and put on woman∣ly
Airs even at ten Years of Age. In a
Word, our Youth in general, are above
Correction; without Shame, too ripe, too
ignorant, and too impudent, and according
to the Poet.<Q><L>Now little Miss in Hanging-Sleeves knows
more</L><L>Than formerly her Grandame at three∣score:</L><L>And Master who was lately whipt at School,</L><L>At bare thirteen sets up for Rake and Fool,</L><L>Runs the whole Race of Vice with full
Career,</L><L>Is green and ripe and rotten in a Year.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27"/>
Instead of Puerile Diversions, our Boys
of 14 or 15 Years of Age go to Plays, be∣come
Members of Clubs, keep Hounds and
Horses, and sometimes follow worse Game.
This is owing to the over Indulgence of Pa∣rents,
who let them finger Money before
they know the Worth of it; and if a Stop
be not put to such Practices in this Generati∣on,
the next may severely repent it.</P>
<P>Instead of Babies, Play-Things, and other
pretty Innocencies used of old, our Girls
at 10 or 11 Years of Age, keep their visit∣ing
Days, have their select Companies,
and treat 'em with as much Solemnity and
Expence, as their Parents do their own Ac∣quaintance:
This prevails not only at
Court, but in the City; and I doubt not
but the Court Airs of the Mother, and the
womanly Airs of the Daughter, have made
Bankrupt many an honest Man, who had
not Courage enough to repel the Force of
this most prevailing, most pernicious
Custom.</P>
<P>This idle Custom is not only very Expen∣sive,
but extreamly inconvenient withal;
for there is as much a Fuss made at some
Houses against such a Miss or such a Miss
comes to visit the Daughter, as if a Dutch∣ess
was expected. The Servants are hin∣dred
from their other Business, and the
whole House is in a Fluster to receive
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
Miss's Visitors forsooth. When the Visit is
return'd, she must be dress'd up to the heighth
of the Mode, and some new Thing or other
is always wanted: Not to mention Top-Knots,
Gloves, Coach-hire, and other una∣voidable
Expences.</P>
<P>This is most criminal in those who
cannot afford it; Such People would
therefore do well to reduce their Children
to the Old Standard; that is to say, make
Scholars of their Boys, and Housewives
of their Girls: for the Education above
complain'd of, has spoil'd many a good
Tradesman's Wife, and been the Ruin of
many a Family.</P>
<P>I cannot close this Discourse, without
particularly cautioning the young Ladies
of this Age, how they Laugh, Fleer, and toss
up their Noses at sober Matrons, and el∣derly
Ladies. Let 'em consider, that those
very Persons were once young and beau∣tiful
as themselves, if not more beautiful:
For to say truth, Tea, Drams, Wine,
and late Hours, have not a jot added
to the Beauty of the present Gene∣ration.</P>
<P>Let
them again consider, that their
own Mothers as well as themselves, are
of the same Sex: That it is a foul Bird
bewrays its own Nest; that the very
Infirmities they deride in those Persons,
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
are probably occasioned by the bearing
and bringing up many Children; and that
the Wrinkles in their Faces are occasioned
by their Care to support such giddy
brain'd Creatures as themselves.</P>
<P>But such is the Ignorance and Impu∣dence
of the present Generation, that
young People look upon their Elders, as
upon a different Species, an inferiour Class
of People: They ascribe no Merit to the
Virtue and Experience of Old Age, but
assume to themselves the Preference in
all things. With them a Face and a good
Shape is Merit, a scornful toss of the
Head, and despising every Body, but their
own dear selves is Wit, an everlasting
Giddiness, and an eternal Grin is Affabili∣ty
and good Nature, fancy in Dress, is
Understanding, a supine Neglect of every
thing commendable Gentility; and a pro∣digious
Punctilio in the greatest Trifles, is
the Heighth of good Breeding.</P>
<P>From this general Corruption in Edu∣cation,
proceeds all that may be com∣plain'd
of in this present Age, and what∣ever
Evils may be expected in Generations
to come. But above all, nothing has more
contributed to this Corruption, than the
disregard paid to Teachers and other Per∣sons
concern'd in the Education of Youth;
for the first and chief Step to the Ruin of
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
Youth, is when they have no Awe upon
'em, and are above Correction.</P>
<P><HI>Spare the Rod and spoil the Child,</HI> is a
Sentence of so much Weight and Truth;
that no sharper a Reprimand can be given
to those Parents, who have stimulated in
their Children a Spirit of Pride, and taught
them to look contemptibly on their Tu∣tors.
The very Word <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Mistress</HI>
implies something of Dominion; and as
Youth are committed to their Care, so they
ought to be subject to their Discipline.</P>
<P>It shocks me when I see a Tutor in a
great Family, put upon a Footing with the
Servants; it makes his Pupil think con∣temptibly
of him, and is too great a Curb
on his Spirits, to let him deliver his
Instructions and Sentiments, in a manner
suitable to the Dignity of an Instructor.
And what is worse, the little Deference
paid to him, begets in the young Gentle∣man
a mean Opinion of and Indifference to
Learning it self, seeing his Master reap so
little Advantage and Respect from it.</P>
<P>It is the same Case in Schools, where
the Master's or Mistress's passive and sor∣did
Temper makes them the Slaves of the
Scholars, whom they dare not correct, for
fear of loosing: Nothing being more com∣mon
now a days, than for Parents to
make it in their Bargain, that their Chil∣dren
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
shall not be whipt, or otherwise cor∣rected
at School. Hence proceeds all that
Noise and Misrule, which reigns in Schools,
stunning both Master and Scholars to
such a Degree, that they can hardly hear
each other speak.</P>
<P>Parents therefore can blame none but
themselves, if by these pernicious Me∣thods,
their Children grow in time to be
too many for them; nor can they with
any reason expect to find Duty and Hu∣manity,
where they have not been in∣culcated.
If they have countenanc'd, or
indulg'd their Children, in deriding the
hoary Head, are they to be pitied when
they reap seven Fold the Fruits of so un∣generous
a Tillage? or to speak more
plain, when it comes Home to themselves.
Let every Person therefore make the Case
their own, when they see Children taunt∣ing
and flouncing at their Parents, Teach∣ers,
or Relations; mocking and deriding
People for Age and Infirmities, or indeed
any other bodily Misfortune, or Deformity;
upbraiding any for their Poverty, or crowing
over any Person, over whom they may pre∣tend
to claim Preheminence. This domi∣neering
way being now a days so preva∣lent,
that Tradesmen, Servants and other
Dependants, are generally more insulted by
Children, than by Masters and Mistresses
themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="32"/>
To conclude, as we sow we shall reap;
As we bring up our Children, so we may
expect to find them: If we educate them
in the Nurture and Fear of the Lord, in
an universal Benevolence to all Mankind,
void of all personal or Party Prejudice;
if we train them up to be dutiful to their
Parents, respectful to their Teachers, man∣nerly
to their Equals, and courteous to their
Inferiours; if we incite in 'em an Emula∣tion
and Thirst after Knowledge and other
liberal Acquirements; If we instil into 'em
early Principles of Humanity, Compassion
and Forbearance; and in a Word, all that
may inspire to the highest Notions of
Honour, and carry human Nature to its
most exalted Pitch; then may we expect
to have Comfort in Old Age, from our
Grand Children, our Children and other
Relations; then may we conclude we
have laid a sure Foundation for the Happi∣ness
of succeeding Generations.</P>
<P>But if on the contrary, we humour and
favour all their little Petulancies, and by o∣ver
praising and indulging them, make
our selves contemptible in their Eyes; if
instead of correcting them in their Errors,
we arraign the Justice of Discipline, and
call it Severity; if we suffer them with
Impunity to fly in the Faces of their Parents
and Relations, to defy their Teachers, to
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
outvie their Equals, and insult their Infe∣riours;
If we permit 'em to scoff at, and
turn to ridicule the Misfortunes and Afflic∣tions
of others, and in a manner, suppress,
or at least, not encourage in them any
Propensity to Tenderness, but suffer their
Hearts to be hardned, and to know no
Pity: we must expect to have our Eyes
pluck'd out by those we have brought up.
We must look for nothing in Old Age, but
Contempt, Oppression, and all the Insults
we have but too much reason to fear
from so inhuman a Generation.</P>

<HEAD>A PROJECT for erecting a PRO∣TESTANT-MONASTERY.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT a Joint-Stock of Twen∣ty
Thousand Pounds be raised
between 50 Persons, by an
equal Deposite of four Hun∣dred
Pounds each; which Stock
is to be vested in themselves only. For
this being no Charity, but rather a Co∣partnership,
there is no need of having any
Governor, Treasurer, Director, or other
commanding Officer, but what may be
chosen among themselves; and as the Mo∣ney
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
is their own, they are the fittest Per∣sons
to keep it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after they have obtained his
Majesty's Sanction, and are become a Body
Corporate under what Name or Title they
shall think fit, they may chuse from a∣mong
themselves, one Treasurer, two
Wardens, and such other Officers they shall
deem proper; which Officers shall have
annual Rotation, and new ones be
chosen every year.</P>
<P N="3">3. That instead of consuming all, or a
great Part of the Stock in Building, which
would nip the Project in the Bud, they
shall rent a convenient Hall or House in
Town or Country, at their own Option;
which House must be equally divided into
Apartments: and to save another great
Expence, as well as to prevent Partiality,
or Disgust, 'tis fit that every Person fur∣nish
their own Apartment, which Furni∣ture
they may bequeath to whom they
please. For as all the Members of the Col∣lege
are to be upon an equal Footing,
'tis highly necessary there should not be the
the least Distinction among them in Diet,
Lodging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if one Person dresses
or furnishes better than another, there
will be no need of Complaint, because
they do it at their own Charge: Tho' to
speak my Mind, it would look most love∣ly,
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
to have a decent Equality and Unifor∣mity
in Dress.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Kitchin, the Infirmary, and o∣ther
Offices, to be furnished at the common
Expence, but not to be taken out of the
Joint-Stock. On the contrary, every Per∣son
to pay an equal Proportion, which can∣not
amount to above two Guineas a Head.
But in Case the Joint-Stock encreases, the
Money to be refunded.</P>
<P N="5">5. That they call a Court among them∣selves
as often as they shall think fit; at
which every Member shall have an equal
Vote; the Treasurer taking the Chair. At
these Courts every thing shall be settled,
all Bargains made, all Accounts audited,
Servants hired or displac'd, the Diet,
and College Hours settled; and bye Laws
made or amended as Occasion, or the
general Consent shall point out.</P>
<P N="6">6. As all are to share the Benefit, it
may readily be supposed that the best Ad∣vantage
will be made of the Money; but
above all that they will go on a sure
Footing, and content themselves with the
less Interest, upon the greater Security.
Tho' I must confess I know of no safer
and more profitable Method than to lend
Money on proper Deposits; as Goods,
Merchandises, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after the Manner of
the Charitable Corporation in <HI>Fenchurch-Street.</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
This, or some such sure Method,
may bring in twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> on their
Money, which will considerably encrease
their Capital, better their Provisions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and in time make them a very wealthy
Body. But in case no more than five
<HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest be produc'd from their
Capital of twenty Thousand Pounds, it
will amount to one Thousand Pounds <HI>per

<P>These Salaries may be enlarged as the
College encreases in Wealth, or the whole
Subscription may be doubled at first, and
every thing in proportion. But as this is
only a Sketch or rough Draught, farther
Particulars from me would be needless:
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
Besides I am but a poor Calculator, and
only give the Hint to the Publick, as my
Duty to my fellow Christians: I wish
for nothing more than to see it improved,
and if I don't properly explain my self,
People must be so charitable to think for
me: For I write even this under many
bodily Infirmities, and am so impatient
to have done, that I forget half I have to
say. But to proceed,</P>
<P>The Salaries amounting to a Hundred
Pounds a Year, and allowing another
Hundred for a House, till there shall be
Overplus enough to build one; there re∣mains
just eight Hundred Pounds per <HI>An∣num</HI>
for Provision.</P>
<P>If this should be deficient, it will easily
be made up out of the Overplus which will
accrue.<LIST>
<ITEM>1<HI>st,</HI> From making better Advantage of
their Money than is here proposed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> From the Money paid at the Ad∣mission
of new Members, as the old ones
dye. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3<HI>dly,</HI> From the Legacies which the old
Members may leave to augment the Stock;
for if but one Member die in a Year,
there is four Hundred Pounds to be ad∣ded
to the Thousand, which will con∣siderably
augment every Article. If more
should dye, or Legacies be left, the Stock
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
will encrease, and consequently the Interest
thereof will make allowance for greater
Expences, and by degrees render the whole
more Noble and Magnificent.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Excuse, gentle Reader! my immethodical
Manner of calculating, and help me out
the best you can, for I have forgot some
Things which ought to have been men∣tioned
before; but writing just as they
occur, I must leave the whole to be me∣thodized
and amended, by a clearer Head
and a more able Hand.</P>
<P>I have mentioned Salaries without pre∣scribing
for what, give me leave there∣fore
to assign the Officers their proper
Employments.</P>
<P>The <HI>Treasurer</HI> must have care of the
Cash, and be Chairman of all Committees.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wardens</HI> must look after the Pro∣visions,
agree with all Tradesmen, and
superintend the Accounts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Physician</HI> must visit twice a Week,
or oftner if need be, and prescribe to
the sick Members: He may likewise ap∣point
the Apothecary, inspect his Medi∣cines,
and tax his Bills.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clerk</HI> or <HI>Book-keeper</HI> must be con∣stantly
in the accompting House, to set
down every Particular, to minute the pro∣ceeding
of Committees, to keep the ac∣count
of Cash, and in a word, to take the
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
trouble of writing off the <HI>Treasurer</HI> and
<HI>Warden</HI>'s Hands; he must diet in the
House. As also,</P>
<P>The <HI>Chaplain,</HI> some sober elderly de∣cay'd
Clergyman of good Morals, to read
Prayers Morning and Evening; and every
Sunday a Sermon out of Bishop <HI>Tillotson,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Scot,</HI> Dr. <HI>South,</HI> or some other sound
Divine: And to further this good Work,
I my self will present the College with
a handsome Bible, and Common Prayer
Book, and all the Sermons above-men∣tioned,
if I live to see it finish'd; and
if I dye before, I have made proper Pro∣vision
in my Will.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cook</HI> must dress the Victuals, keep
clean the Kitchin, Pantry and Cellar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Laundry-Maid</HI> must wash and
mend their Linnen, and wait at Table.</P>
<P>The <HI>House-Maid</HI> must make the Beds,
sweep the Rooms and wait at Table.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Nurses</HI> must attend the Infir∣mary,
and sit up alternately if need be; and
when none are Sick, they must help, get
up and mend the Linnen, and assist the
other Servants, as the Treasurer and Ward∣ens
shall appoint.</P>
<P>As the Thing encreases, so may the Ser∣vants
and their Wages. A Porter, a But∣ler,
a Scullion, and other Servants may
be added as the Members think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="40"/>
To crown all, let the whole be in∣dependent,
and among themselves; let
them always keep the Staff in their own
Hands, and never subject themselves to
Treasurers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> out of their own Body.
Let them accept of no Charities, but do as
many as they are able; and in a Word,
let them keep up the Grandeur of the De∣sign,
to such a Pitch, that their Friends and
Relations may not be ashamed to visit them;
but on the contrary, be proud they are
of such a Body. Let the Election of new
Members be vested only in themselves, and
let them chuse only such as shall give Repu∣tation
to the College.</P>
<P>In a Word, I have drawn up my Scheme
in general Terms, it being intended for
the Benefit of either Sex. 'Tis indifferent
whether the Ladies compose a College,
and call themselves Sisters, or any other
Name they shall think fit; or whether a
College be compos'd of Gentlemen, under
the Title of Brothers, Fellows, or any other
Denomination; our <HI>PROTESTANT
MONASTERY</HI> is still the same; nor
can a Name alter its Property, or make
it less beneficial or commendable.</P>
