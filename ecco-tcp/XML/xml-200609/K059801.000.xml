<HEAD><HI>Augusta Triumphans:</HI>
OR, THE
WAY
TO MAKE
<HI>LONDON</HI>
The most Flourishing
CITY in the Universe.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Man who has the Publick Good
in View, ought not in the least to
be alarm'd at the tribute of Ridi∣cule
which Scoffers constantly
pay to projecting Heads: It is the Business
of a Writer, who means well, to go direct∣ly
forward, without regard to Criticism,
but to offer his Thoughts as they occur; and
if in twenty Schemes, he hits but on one to
the Purpose, he ought to be excused fail∣ing
in the Nineteen for the Twentieth
Sake. 'Tis a kind of good Action to
mean well, and the Intention ought to pal∣liate
the Failure, but the <HI>English,</HI> of all
People in the World, show least Mercy to
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Schemists, for they treat them in the vi∣lest
manner; whereas other Nations give
them fair Play for their Lives, which is
the reason why we are esteem'd so bad at
Invention.</P>
<P>I have but a short Time to live, nor
would I waste my remaining Thread of
Life in Vain, but having often lamented
sundry Publick Abuses, and many Schemes
having occur'd to my Fancy, which to me
carried an Air of Benefit; I was resolv'd to
commit them to Paper before my Departure,
and leave, at least, a Testimony of my good
Will to my Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>But of all my Reflections, none was more
constantly my Companion than a deep Sor∣row
for the present decay of Learning a∣mong
us, and the manifest Corruption of
Education; we have been a brave and learned
People, and are insensibly dwindling into
an Effeminate, Superficial Race: Our young
Gentlemen are sent to the Universities 'tis
true, but not under Restraint or Cor∣rection
as formerly; not to study, but to
drink; not for Furniture for the Head, but
a Feather for the Cap, merely to say they
have been at <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge,</HI> as if
the Air of those Places inspir'd Knowledge
without Application. 'Tis true, we ought
to have those Places in Reverence for the
many learned Men they have sent us; but
why must we go so far for Knowledge?
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
why should a young Gentleman be sent raw
from the Nursery to live on his own Hands,
to be liable to a thousand Temptations, and
run the Risque of being snapt up by sharp∣ing
Jilts, with which both Universities a∣bound,
who make our Youth of Fortune
their Prey, and have brought Misery into
too many good Families? Not only the Ha∣zard
of their Healths from Debauches of
both Kinds, but the waste of their precious
Time renders the sending them so far off
very hazardous. Why should such a Me∣tropolis
as <HI>London</HI> be without an Universi∣ty?
Would it not save considerably the Ex∣pence
we are at in sending our young Gen∣tlemen
so far from <HI>London?</HI> Would it not
add to the Lustre of our State, and culti∣vate
Politeness among us? What Benefits
may we not in time expect from so glori∣ous
a Design? Will not <HI>London</HI> become
the Scene of Science? And what reason have
we but to hope we may vye with any Neigh∣bouring
Nations? Not that I would have
<HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI> neglected, for the
Good they have done: Besides, there are
too many fine Endowments to be sunk, we
may have Universities at those Places, and
at <HI>London</HI> too, without Prejudice. Know∣ledge
will never hurt us, and whoever lives
to see an University here, will find it give
quite another turn to the Genius and Spi∣rit
of our Youth in general.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
How many Gentlemen pass their Lives in
a shameful Indolence, who might employ
themselves to the purpose, were such a De∣sign
set on foot? Learning would flourish,
Art revive, and not only those who study'd
would benefit by it; but the Blessing would
be convey'd to others by Conversation.</P>
<P>And in order to this so laudable design,
small Expence is required: The sole Charge
being the hire of a convenient Hall or
House, which if they please, they may call
a College. But I see no necessity the Pu∣pils
have to lye or diet there; that may be
done more reasonably and conveniently at
home, under the Eye of their Friends:
Their only necessary Business at College be∣ing
to attend their Tutors at stated Hours,
and (Bed and Board excepted) to conform
themselves to College Laws, and perform
the same Exercises as if they were actually
at <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>Let the best of Tutors be provided, and
Professors in all Faculties encouraged, this
will do a double good, not only to the In∣structed,
but to the Instructors. What a
fine Provision may here be made for Num∣bers
of ingenious Gentlemen, now unpre∣ferr'd?
And to what a heighth may even a
small Beginning grow in time?</P>
<P>As <HI>London</HI> is so extensive, so its Uni∣versity
may be compos'd of many Colleges,
quarter'd at convenient Distances; for Ex∣ample,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
one at <HI>Westminster,</HI> one at St.
<HI>James</HI>'s, one near <HI>Ormond Street;</HI> (that
part of the Town abounding in Gentry)
one in the Centre of the Inns of Court;
another near the <HI>Royal-Exchange;</HI> and
more if Occasion and Encouragement
permit.</P>
<P>The same Offices and Regulations may
be constituted, Cooks, Butlers, Bed-ma∣kers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> excepted, as at other Universi∣ties.
As for Endowment, there is no need,
the whole may be done by Subscription;
and that an easy one; considering nothing
but Instructions are paid for.</P>
<P>In a Word, an Academical Education
is so much wanted in <HI>London,</HI> that every
Body of Ability and Figure, will readily
come into it; and I dare engage the Place
need but be chosen, and Tutors appro∣ved
of, to compleat the Design at once.</P>
<P>It may be objected that there is a kind
of University at <HI>Gresham-College,</HI> where
Professors in all Sciences are maintained and
obliged to read Lectures every Day, or at
least as often as demanded. The Design is
most laudable, but it smells too much of
the <HI>Sine Cure;</HI> they only read in Term-Time,
and then their Lectures are so hur∣ried
over, the Audience is little the better.
They cannot be turn'd out; 'tis a good Set∣tlement
for Life, and they are very easy in
their Studies when once fix'd. Whereas
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
were the Professorship, during good Beha∣viour,
there would be a Study to maintain
their Posts, and their Pupils would reap
the Benefit.</P>
<P>Upon second Thought, I think Colleges
for University Education, might be formed
at <HI>Westminster, Eaton,</HI> the <HI>Charter-House,</HI>
St. <HI>Pauls, Merchant-Taylors,</HI> and other
Publick Schools, where Youth might begin
and end their Studies; but this may be far∣ther
consider'd of.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot the most material
Point, which is, that his Majesty's Sanction
must first be obtain'd, and the University
propos'd have Power to confer Degrees,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and other Academical Priviledges.</P>
<P>As I am quick to conceive, I am eager
to have done, unwilling to overwork a Sub∣ject;
I had rather leave part to the Concep∣tion
of the Readers, than to tire them or
my Self with protracting a Theme; as if
like a Chancery Man, or a Hackney Au∣thor,
I wrote by the Sheet for hire: So
let us have done with this Topick, and
proceed to another; which is,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>A Proposal to prevent Murder, Disho∣nour,
and other Abuses, by erecting an
<HI>Hospital</HI> for Foundlings.</HEAD>
<P>IT is needless to run into a Declamati∣on
on this Head, since not a Sessions
passes, but we see one or more merciless
Mothers try'd for the Murder of their Ba∣stard-Children;
and to the Shame of good
Government, generally escape the Venge∣ance
due to shedders of Innocent Blood:
For 'tis a common Practice now among
them, to hire a set of Old-Bedlams, or pre∣tended
Midwives, who make it their Trade
to bring them off for three or four Guineas,
having got the ready rote of swearing the
Child was not at its full Growth, for which
they have a hidden Reserve, that is to say,
the Child was not at Man's or Woman's
Growth. Thus do these impious Wretches
cheat the World, and damn their own Souls
by a double Meaning, which too often im∣poses
on a cautious, merciful and credu∣lous
Jury, and gives wicked Murderers
means to escape and commit fresh Sins,
to which their Acquitters no doubt are
accessary.</P>
<P>I wonder so many Men of Sense, as have
been on the Jury, have been so often im∣pos'd
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
upon by the stale Pretence of a Scrap
or two of Child-Bed Linnen being found
in the Murderer's Box, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when alas!
perhaps it was ne'er put there till after the
Murder was committed; or if it was, but
with a view of saving themselves by that
devilish Precaution; for so many have been
acquitted on that Pretence, that 'tis but too
common a Thing to provide Child-Bed-Linnen
before-hand for a poor Innocent
Babe they are determin'd to murder.</P>
<P>But alas! What are the exploded Mur∣ders
to those which escape the Eye of the
Magistrate, and dye in Silence? Add to
this procur'd Abortions, and other in∣direct
means, which wicked Wretchesmake
use off to screen themselves from the Cen∣sure
of the World, which they dread more
than the Displeasure of their Maker.</P>
<P>Those who cannot be so hard-hearted
to murder their own Offspring themselves,
take a slower, tho' as sure a way, and get
it done by others, by dropping their Chil∣dren,
and leaving them to be starved by
Parish-Nurses.</P>
<P>Thus is God robb'd of a Creature, in
whom he had breath'd the Breath of Life,
and on whom he had stamp'd his Image;
the World of an Inhabitant, who might
have been of use; the King of a Subject;
and future Generations of an Issue not to be
accounted for, had this Infant lived to have
been a Parent.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
It is therefore the height of Charity and
Humanity, to provide against this Barba∣rity,
to prevent this crying Sin, and ex∣tract
Good, even out of Evil, by saving
these Innocent Babes from Slaughter, and
bringing them up in the Nurture and Fear
of the Lord; to be of Benefit to themselves
and Mankind in General.</P>
<P>And what nearer, what better way can
we have, than to erect and endow a pro∣per.
Hospital or House to receive them,
where we may see them tenderly brought
up, as so many living Monuments of our
Charity; every one of them being a con∣vincing
Proof of a Christian saved, and a
Murder prevented?</P>
<P>Nor will this be attended with so much
Charge as is imagin'd, for we find in many
Parishes, that Parents have re-demanded
their Children, on encrease of Circumstan∣ces,
and paid all Costs with a handsome
Present in the Bargain; and many Times
when a Clandestine Marriage is clear'd up,
and openly avow'd, they would purchase
the First-Fruits of their Loves at any Rate:
Oftentimes a Couple may have no more
Children, and an Infant thus sav'd, may
arrive to inherit a good Estate, and become
a Benefactor, where it was once an Object
of Charity.</P>
<P>But let us suppose the worst, and ima∣gine
the Infant begot in Sin and without
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the Sanction of Wedlock; is it therefore to
be murder'd, starv'd or neglected, because
its Parents were wicked? hard Fate of
innocent Children, to suffer for their Pa∣rents
Faults! Where God has thought fit
to give his Image and Life, there is Nou∣rishment
demanded; that calls aloud for
our Christian and Human Assistance, and
best shows our Nobleness of Soul, when we
generously assist those who cannot help
themselves.</P>
<P>If the Fault devolv'd on the Children,
our Church would deny them Baptism,
Burial, and other Christian Rites; but our
Religion carries more Charity with it, they
are not deny'd even to partake of our Bles∣sed
Sacraments, and are excluded no
one Branch or Benefit accruing from Chri∣stianity;
if so, how unjust are those who
arraign 'em for their Parents Faults, and
how barbarous are those Parents, who, tho'
able, make no Provision for them, because
they are not Legitimate: My Child, is my
Child, let it be begot in Sin or Wedlock,
and all the Duties of a Parent are incum∣bent
on me so long as it lives; if it sur∣vives
me, I ought to make a Provision for
it, according to my Ability; and tho' I do
not set it on a Footing with my Legiti∣mate
Children, I ought in Conscience, to
provide against Want and Shame, or I am
answerable for every Sin or Extravagance
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
my Child is forc'd or led into, for want
of my giving an Allowance to prevent it.</P>
<P>We have an Instance very fresh, in every
ones Memory, of an ingenious, nay, a sober
young Nobleman, for such I must call him,
whose either Father was a Peer, and his
Mother a Peeress: This unhappy Gentleman
toss'd from Father to Father, at last found
none, and himself a Vagabond, forced to
every Shift; he in a manner starved for ma∣ny
Years, yet was guilty of no Capital
Crime, till that unhappy Accident occur'd,
which God has given him Grace, and
Sense enough-to repent: However, I can∣not
but think his hard-hearted Mother
will bear her Portion of the Guilt, till
wash'd away by a severe Repentance.</P>
<P>What a Figure might this Man have
made in Life, had due Care been taken? If
his Peerage had not been adjusted, he might
at least have been a fine Gentleman; nay
probably, have fill'd some handsome Post
in the Government with Applause, and
call'd as much for Respect, as he does now
for Pity.</P>
<P>Nor is this Gentleman the only Person
begot, and neglected by Noble, or rather
Ignoble Parents; we have but too many now
living, who owe their Birth to the best of our
Peerage, and yet know not where to eat.
Hard Fate, when the Child would be glad
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
the Scraps, which the Servants throw a∣way!
but Heaven generally rewards them
accordingly, for many Noble Families
are become Extinct, and large Estates ali∣enated
into other Houses, while their own
Issue want Bread.</P>
<P>And now, methinks, I hear some over∣squeamish
Ladies cry, <HI>what would this
Fellow be at? would not he set up a
Nursery for Lewdness, and encourage
Fornication? who would be afraid of sin∣ning,
if they can so easily get rid of their
Bastards? we shall soon be over-run with</HI>
Foundlings <HI>when there is such Encourage∣ment
given to</HI> Whoredom: To which I an∣swer,
that I am as much against Bastards
being begot, as I am for their being mur∣der'd;
but when a Child is once begot,
it cannot be unbegotten; and when once
born it must be kept; the Fault, as I said
before, is in the Parents, not the Child;
and we ought to shew our Charity towards
it as a Fellow-Creature and Christian,
without any regard to its Legitimacy or
otherwise.</P>
<P>The only way to put a stop to this grow∣ing
Evil, would be to oblige all House∣keepers,
not to admit a Man and Woman
as Lodgers, till they were certify'd of their
being lawfully marry'd; for now-a-Days
nothing is more common than for a Whore-monger
and a Strumpet to pretend Mar∣riage,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
till they have left a Child or two
on the Parish, and then shift to another
end of the Town.</P>
<P>If there were no Receivers there would
be no Thieves: If there were no Bawdy-Houses
there would be no Whores; and
though Persons letting Lodgings be not
actual Procurers, yet, if they connive at
the Embraces of a Couple, whose Mar∣riage
is doubtful, they are no better than
Bawds, and their Houses no more than
Brothels.</P>
<P>Now should any Body ask, how shall
this Hospital be Built? how endow'd?
to which I answer, follow the Steps of the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> the <HI>Hamburgers,</HI> and other fo∣reign
States, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have for Ages past
prosecuted this glorious Design, and found
their Account therein: As for building a
House I am utterly against it, especially in
the Infancy of the Affair: Let a Place con∣venient
be hir'd: Why should such a con∣siderable
Sum be sunk in building as has in
late publick Structures, which have swal∣low'd
up part of the Profits and Dividend, if
not the Capital, of unwary Stock-mongers?</P>
<P>To my great Joy I find my Project al∣ready
anticipated, and a noble Subscription
carrying on for this purpose; to promote
which, I exhort all Persons of Compassion
and Generosity, and shall think my self
happy, if what I have said on this Head,
may any ways contribute to further the
same.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Having said all I think material on this
Subject, I beg pardon for leaving my Rea∣der
so abrubtly, and crave Leave to
proceed to another Article. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>A Proposal to prevent the expensive Im∣portation
of <HI>Foreign Musicians,</HI> &amp;c.
by forming an Academy of our own.</HEAD>
<P>IT will no doubt be asked, what have I
to do with Musick? to which I answer,
I have been a Lover of the Science from my
Infancy, and in my younger Days was ac∣counted
no despicable Performer on the Viol
and Lute, then much in Vogue. I esteem it
the most innocent Amusement in Life; it
gently relaxes, after too great a hurry of Spi∣rits,
and composes the Mind into a Sedateness,
prone to every thing that's generous and
good; and when the more necessary parts
of Education are finish'd, 'tis a most gen∣teel
and commendable Accomplishment; it
saves a great deal of Drinking and Debau∣chery
in our Sex, and helps the Ladies off
with many an idle Hour, which sometimes
might probably be worse employ'd other∣wise.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Our Quality, Gentry, and better sort
of Traders must have Diversions; and if
those that are commendable be denied, they
will take to worse: Now what can be more
commendable than Musick, one of the se∣ven
liberal Sciences, and no mean Branch
of the Mathematicks?</P>
<P>Were it for no other Reason I should
esteem it, because it was the favourite Di∣version
of his late Majesty, of glorious
Memory; who was as wife a Prince as e∣ver
fill'd the <HI>British</HI> Throne. Nor is it
less esteem'd by their present Majesties,
whose Souls are form'd for Harmony, and
who have not disdain'd to make it a part
in the Education of their sacred Race.</P>
<P>Our Nobility and Gentry have shown
their Love to the Science, by supporting at
such prodigious Expence, the <HI>Italian Opera</HI>
improperly call'd an Academy; but they have
at the same time shown no small Partiality
in discouraging any thing <HI>English,</HI> and o∣ver-loading
the Town with such heaps of
Foreign <HI>Musicians.</HI></P>
<P>An Academy, rightly understood, is a
Place for the Propagation of Science, by
training up Persons thereto from younger
to riper Years, under the Instruction and
Inspection of proper Artists: How then can
the <HI>Italian Opera</HI> properly be call'd an Aca∣demy,
when none are admitted but such as
are, at least are thought, or ought to
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
be, adepts in Musick? If that be an Aca∣demy,
so are the Theatres of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI>
and <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields:</HI> Nay, <HI>Punch</HI>'s
<HI>Opera</HI> may pass for a lower kind of Aca∣demy.
Would it not be a glorious thing
to have an <HI>Opera</HI> of our own, in our own
most noble Tongue, in which the Com∣poser,
Singers, and Orchestre, should be
of our own Growth? Not that we ought
to disclaim all Obligations to <HI>Italy,</HI> the
Mother of Musick, the Nurse of <HI>Corelli,
Handel, Bononcini,</HI> and <HI>Geminiani;</HI> but
then we ought not to be so stupidly
partial, to imagine our Selves too Brutal
a part of Mankind, to make any Progress
in the Science: By the same reason that we
love it, we may excel in it; Love begets
Application, and Application Perfection.
We have already had a <HI>Purcel,</HI> and no
doubt, there are now many latent Genius's,
who only want proper Instruction, Appli∣cation,
and ENCOURAGEMENT, to become
great Ornaments of the Science, and make
<HI>England</HI> emulate even <HI>Rome</HI> it self.</P>
<P>What a number of excellent Performers
on all Instruments, have sprung up in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
within these few Years? that this is
owing to the <HI>Opera,</HI> I will not deny, and
so far the <HI>Opera</HI> is an Academy, as it re∣fines
the Taste, and inspires Emulation.</P>
<P>But tho' we are happy in Instrumental
Performers, we frequently send to <HI>Italy</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
for Singers, and that at no small Ex∣pence:
To remedy which, I humbly pro∣pose,
that the Governours of <HI>Christ's-Hos∣pital</HI>
will show their publick Spirit, by
forming an Academy of Musick on their
Foundation, after this or the like man∣ner.</P>
<P>That
out of their great number of Chil∣dren,
thirty Boys be selected, of good Ears
and Propensity to Musick.</P>
<P>That these Boys be divided into three
Classes, <HI>viz.</HI> Six for Wind-Instruments,
such as the Hautboy, Bassoon, and Ger∣man-Flute.</P>
<P>That
sixteen others be selected for String-Instruments,
or at least the most useful, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Violin and Bass-Violin.</P>
<P>That the remaining eight be particu∣larly
chosen for Voice, and Organ, or
Harpsichord. That all in due time, be
taught Composition. The Boys thus cho∣sen,
three Masters should be elected, each
most excellent in his Way; that is to say,
one for the Wind-Instrument, another for
the String'd, and a third for the Voice and
Organ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Handsome Salaries should be allowed
these Masters, to engage their constant At∣tendance
every Day, from eight till twelve
in the Morning; and I think a 100<HI>l.
per Annum</HI> for each, would be sufficient,
which will be a Trifle to so wealthy a Body.
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
The multiplicity of Holidays should be a∣bridg'd,
and only a few kept; there
cannot be too few, considering what a
hinderance they are to juvenile Studies. It
is a vulgar Error that has too long prevail'd
all over <HI>England,</HI> to the great Detriment
of Learning, and many Boys have been
made Blockheads, in Complaisance to
Kings and Saints, dead for many Ages
past.</P>
<P>The Morning employ'd in Musick, the
Boys should go in the Afternoon, or so
many Hours, to the Reading and Writ∣ing-School,
and in the Evening should
practice, at least two Hours before Bed∣time,
and two before the Master comes in
the Morning. This Course held for seven
or eight Years, will make them fine Pro∣ficients;
but that they should not go too
raw, or young, out of the Academy, 'tis
proper, that at the stated Age of Appren∣ticeship,
they be bound to the Hospital to
engage their greater Application, and make
them thorough Masters, before they launch
out into the World; for one great hinde∣rance
to many Performers is, that they be∣gin
to teach too soon, and obstruct their
Genius.</P>
<P>What will not such a Design produce in
a few Years? will they not be able to perform
a Consort, Choir, or Opera, or all three a∣mong
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
themselves, and over-pay the Charge,
as shall hereafter be specify'd?</P>
<P>For Example, we will suppose such a
Design to be continued for ten Years, we
shall find an Orchestre of forty Hands, and
a Choir or Opera of twenty Voices, or
admitting that of those twenty, only five
prove Capital Singers, 'twill answer the
Intent.</P>
<P>For the greater Variety they may, if
they think fit, take in two or more of their
Girls where they find a promising Genius,
but this may be further consider'd of.</P>
<P>Now, when they are enabled to exhibit
an Opera, Will they not gain considerably,
when their Voices and Hands, cost them
only a College Subsistance? And 'tis but
reasonable the Profits accruing from Ope∣ras,
Consorts, or otherwise, should go to
the <HI>Hospital</HI> to make good all former and
future Expences, and enable them to extend
the Design to a greater Length and Gran∣deur;
so than instead of 1500 l. <HI>per Ann.</HI>
the price of one <HI>Italian</HI> Singer, we shall
for 300 l. once in ten Years, have sixty
<HI>English</HI> Musicians regularly educated, and
enabled to live by their Science.</P>
<P>There ought moreover to be annual Proba∣tions,
and proper Prizes or Premiums alloted,
to excite Emulation in the Youths, and give
Life to their Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
They have already a Musick-School, as
they call it, but the Allowance is too poor
for this Design, and the Attendance too
small; it must be every Day, or not at all.</P>
<P>This will be an Academy indeed, and in
Process of Time, they will have even their
Masters among themselves; and what is the
Charge, compar'd with the Profits or
their Abilities?</P>
<P>One thing I had like to have forgot, which
is, that with Permission of the Right Re∣verend
the Lords Spiritual, some Per∣formance
in Musick, suitable to the So∣lemnity
of the Day, be exhibited every
Sunday after Divine Service: Sacred Poesy
and Rhetorick, may be likewise introduc'd to
make it an Entertainment suitable to a Christ∣ian
and Polite Audience; and indeed, we
seem to want some such commendable Em∣ployment
for the better Sort: For we see
the publick Walks and Taverns crowded,
and rather than be idle, they will go to
<HI>Newport- Market.</HI></P>
<P>That such an Entertainment would be
much preferable to Drinking, Gaming, or
profane Discourse, none can deny, and till
it is proved to be prejudicial, I shall always
imagine it necessary. The Hall at the <HI>Hos∣pital,</HI>
will contain few less than seven
hundred People, conveniently seated, which
at so small a Price as one Shilling <HI>per</HI> Head,
will amount to 35 l. per Week; and if the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Performance deserve it, as no doubt it
will in time, they may make it half a
Crown or more, which must considerably
encrease the Income of the <HI>Hospital.</HI></P>
<P>When they are able to make an Opera,
the Profits will be yet more considerable,
nor will they reap much less from what
the Youths bring in during their Ap∣prenticeship,
when employ'd at Consorts,
Theatres, or other publick Entertainments.</P>
<P>Having advanc'd what I think proper on
this Head, or at least enough for a Hint,
I proceed to offer,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>That many Youths and Servants may be
sav'd from Destruction, were the Streets
clear'd of shameless and impudent
Strumpets; Gaming-Tables totally sup∣press'd,
and a stop put to Sabbath De∣bauches.</HEAD>
<P>THE Corruption of our Children
and Servants, is of Importance suffici∣ent
to require our utmost Precaution; and
moreover, Women Servants (common∣ly
call'd Maid-Servants) are such necessary
Creatures, that it is by no means below us
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
to make them beneficial rather than preju∣dicial
to us.</P>
<P>I shall not run into a Description
of their Abuses; we know enough of
those already. Our Business now is to
make them useful, First, by ascertaining
their Wages at a proper Standard.</P>
<P>Secondly, by obliging them to continue
longer in Service, not to stroll about
from Place to Place, and throw themselves
on the Town on every Dislike.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To prevent their being har∣bour'd
by wicked Persons, when out of
Place; or living too long on their own
Hands.</P>
<P>As for their Wages, they have topp'd upon
us already, and doubled 'em in spight of our
Teeth; but as they have had Wit enough
to get 'em, so will they, I doubt not,
have the same Sense to keep 'em: and
much Good may it do those indolent over∣secure
Persons, who have given 'em this
Advantage. However, if they are honest
and diligent, I would have them encou∣rag'd,
and handsome Wages allow'd 'em;
because, by this Means, we provide for
the Children of the inferior Class of Peo∣ple,
who otherwise could not maintain
themselves; nay, sometimes Tradesmen,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> reduced, are glad when their Chil∣dren
cease to hang upon them, by getting
into Service, and by that Means, not
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
only maintaining themselves, but being
of Use in other Families. But then there
ought to be some Medium some Limita∣tion
to their Wages, or they may extort
more than can well be afforded.</P>
<P>Nothing calls more for Redress than
their quitting Service for every idle Dis∣gust,
leaving a Master or Mistress at a
Nonplus; and all under Plea of a foolish
old Custom, call'd Warning; no where
practis'd but in <HI>London:</HI> For in other
Places they are hir'd by the Year, or by
the Statute, as they call it, which settles
them in a Place, at least for some Time;
whereas, when they are not limited, it
encourages a roving Temper, and makes
them never easy.</P>
<P>If you turn them away without Warn∣ing,
they will make you pay a Month's
Wages, be the Provocation or Offence
never so great; but if they leave you,
tho' never so abruptly, or unprovided,
help yourselves how you can, there is no
Redress: Tho' I think there ought, in all
Conscience, to be as much Law for the
Master as for the Servant.</P>
<P>No Servant should quit a Place, where
they are well fed and paid, without as∣signing
a good Reason before a Magi∣strate.
On the other Hand, they should
receive no Abuse which should not be re∣dress'd:
For we ought to treat 'em as
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Servants, not Slaves; and a Medium
ought to be observ'd on both Sides. But
if they are not restrain'd from quitting
Service on every Vagary, they will throw
themselves on the Town, and not only
ruin themselves, but others: For Exam∣ple,
a Girl quits a Place, and turns Whore;
if there is not a Bastard to be murder'd,
or left to the Parish, there is One or more
unwary Youths drawn in to support her
in Lewdness and Idleness; in order to
which, they rob their Parents and Ma∣sters,
nay, sometimes any Body else, to
support their Strumpets; so that many
Thieves owe their Ruin and shameful
Deaths to Harlots. Not to mention the
Communication of loathsome Distempers,
and innumerable other Evils, to which
they give Birth.</P>
<P>How many Youths, of all Ranks, are dai∣ly
ruin'd? And how justly may be dreaded
the Loss of as many more, if a speedy Stop
be not put to this growing Evil? Generati∣ons
to come will curse the Neglect of the
present, and every Sin committed for the
future may be pass'd to our Account, if we
do not use our Endeavours to the contrary.</P>
<P>And unless we prevent our Maid-Ser∣vants
from being harbour'd by wicked
Persons when out of Place, or living too
long on their own Hands, our Streets will
swarm with impudent shameless Strum∣pets;
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
the Good will be molested; those,
prone to Evil, will be made yet more
wicked, by having Temptations thrown
in their Way: And to crown all, we shall
have scarce a Servant left, but our Wives,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> must do the Houshold-work them∣selves.</P>
<P>If
this be not worthy the Consideration
of a Legislature, I would fain know
what is. Is it not Time to limit their
Wages, when they are grown so wanton
they know not what to ask? Is it not
Time to fix 'em, when they stroll from
Place to Place, and we are hardly sure of
a Servant a Month together? Is it not
Time to prevent the Encrease of Harlots,
by making it penal for Servants to be
harbour'd in Idleness, and tempted to
Theft, Whoredom, Murder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by living
too long out of Place? And I am sure
it is high Time to begin the Work, by
clearing the publick Streets of Night∣walkers,
who are grown to such a Pitch
of Impudence, that Peace and common
Decency are manifestly broken in our pub∣lick
Streets. I wonder this has so long
escap'd the Eye of the Magistrate, espe∣cially
when there are already in force
Laws sufficient to restrain this Tide of
Uncleanness, which will one Day over∣flow
us.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
The lewdest People upon Earth, our∣selves
excepted, are not guilty of such
open Violations of the Laws of Decency.
Go all the World over, and you'll see no
such Impudence as in the Streets of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
which makes many Foreigners give
our Women in general a bad Character,
from the vile Specimens they meet with
from one End of the Town to the other.
Our Sessions-Papers are full of the Triais
of impudent Sluts, who first decoy Men,
and then rob 'em: A Meanness the Cour∣tesans
of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> abhor.</P>
<P>How many honest Women, those of
the Inferior Sort especially, get loathsome
Distempers from their Husband's Com∣merce
with these Creatures, which Di∣stempers
are often entail'd on Posterity;
nor have we an Hospital separated for that
Purpose, which does not contain too ma∣ny
Instances of honest poor Wretches
made miserable by Villains of Husbands.</P>
<P>And now I have mentioned the Vil∣lainy
of some Husbands in the lower
State of Life, give me leave to propose,
or at least to wish, that they were re∣strained
from abusing their Wives at that
barbarous Rate, which is now practised
by Butchers, Carmen, and such inferior
Sort of Fellows, who are publick Nu∣sances
to civil Neighbourhoods, and yet no
Body cares to interpose, because the Riot
is between a Man and his Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
I see no Reason why every profligate
Fellow shall have the Liberty to disturb a
whole Neighbourhood, and abuse a poor
honest Creature at a most inhuman Rate,
and is not to be call'd to Account because
it is his Wife; this sort of Barbarity was
never so notorious and so much encourag'd
as at present, for every Vagabond thinks
he may cripple his Wife at pleasure, and
'tis enough to pierce a Heart of Stone to
see how barbarously some poor Creatures
are beaten and abused by merciless Dogs
of Husbands.</P>
<P>It gives an ill Example to the growing
Generation, and this Evil will gain Ground
on us if not prevented: It may be an∣swer'd,
the Law has already provided Re∣dress,
and a Woman abus'd may swear
the Peace against her Husband, but what
Woman cares to do that? It is reveng∣ing
herself on herself, and not without
considerable Charge and Trouble.</P>
<P>There ought to be a shorter way, and
when a Man has beaten his Wife (which
by the Bye is a most unmanly Action, and
great Sign of Cowardice) it behoves every
Neighbour who has the least humanity or
Compassion, to complain to the next Ju∣stice
of the Peace, who should be im∣powered
to set him in the Stocks for the
first Offence; to have him well scourg'd at
the Whipping-Post for the second; and
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
if he persisted in his barbarous Abuse of the
holy Marriage State, to send him to the
House of Correction 'till he should learn
to use more Mercy to his Yoke-fellow.</P>
<P>How hard is it for a poor industrious
Woman to be up early and late, to sit in a
cold Shop, Stall, or Market, all Weathers,
to carry heavy Loads from one End of the
Town to the other, or to work from
Morning till Night, and even then dread
going Home for fear of being murder'd?
Some may think this too low a Topic for
me to expatiate upon, to which I answer,
that it is a Charitable and a Christian one,
and therefore not in the least beneath the
Consideration of any Man who had a Wo∣man
for his Mother.</P>
<P>The Mention of this leads me to exclaim
against the vile Practice now so much in
vogue among the better Sort, as they are
called, but the worst sort in fact, namely,
the sending their Wives to Mad-Houses at
every Whim or Dislike, that they may be
more secure and undisturb'd in their De∣baucheries:
Which wicked Custom is got to
such a Head, that the Number of private
Mad-Houses in and about <HI>London,</HI> are
considerably increased within these few
Years.</P>
<P>This is the heighth of Barbarity and In∣justice
in a Christian Country, it is a
clandestine Inquisition, nay worse.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
How many Ladies and Gentlewomen
are hurried away to these Houses, which
ought to be suppress'd, or at least subject
to daily Examination, as hereafter shall
be proposed?</P>
<P>How many, I say, of Beauty, Vertue,
and Fortune, are suddenly torn from their
dear innocent Babes, from the Arms of an
unworthy Man, who they love (perhaps
but too well) and who in Return for
that Love, nay probably an ample Fortune,
and a lovely Off-spring besides; grows
weary of the pure Streams of chaste Love,
and thirsting after the Puddles of lawless
Lust, buries his vertuous Wife alive, that
he may have the greater Freedom with
his Mistresses?</P>
<P>If they are not mad when they go into
these cursed Houses, they are soon made
so by the barbarous Usage they there suf∣fer,
and any Woman of Spirit who has
the least Love for her Husband, or Con∣cern
for her Family, cannot sit down tamely
under a Confinement and Separation the
most unaccountable and unreasonable.</P>
<P>Is it not enough to make any one mad
to be suddenly clap'd up, stripp'd, whipp'd,
ill fed, and worse us'd? To have no Reason
assign'd for such Treatment, no Crime al∣ledg'd,
or Accusers to confront? And what
is worse, no Soul to appeal to but merci∣less
Creatures, who answer but in Laugh∣ter,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Surliness, Contradiction, and too of∣ten
Stripes?</P>
<P>All Conveniences for Writing are de∣nied,
no Messenger to be had to carry a
Letter to any Relation or Friend; and
if this tyrannical Inquisition, join'd with the
reasonable Reflections, a Woman of any
common Understanding must necessarily
make, be not sufficient to drive any Soul
stark staring mad, though before they were
never so much in their right Senses, I have
no more to say.</P>
<P>When by this Means a wicked Husband
has driven a poor Creature mad, and rob'd
an injur'd Wife of her Reason, for 'tis
much easier to create than to cure Madness,
then has the Villain a handle for his Ro∣guery,
then perhaps he will admit her
distressed Relations to see her, when 'tis
too late to cure the Madness he so artfully
and barbarously has procured.</P>
<P>But this is not all, something more dis∣mal
Effects attend this Inquisition, for Death
is but too often the Cure of their Mad∣ness
and End of their Sorrows; some with
ill Usage, some with Grief, and many with
both are barbarously cut off in the Prime
of their Years and Flower of their Health,
who otherwise might have been Mothers of
a numerous Issue, and surviv'd many Years.
This is Murder in the deepest Sense, and
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
much more cruel than Dagger or Poison,
because more lingring; they die by Peace∣meal,
and in all the Agonies and Terrors
of a distracted Mind.</P>
<P>Nay it is Murder upon Murder, for the
Issue that might have been begot, is to
be accounted for to God and the Publick.
Now if this kind of Murder is conniv'd
at, we shall no doubt have enough, nay
too much of it; for if a Man is weary of
his Wife, has spent her Fortune, and
wants another, 'tis but sending her to a
Mad-House and the Business is done at once.</P>
<P>How many have already been mur∣dered
after this manner is best known to
just Heaven, and those unjust Husbands
and their damn'd Accomplices, who, tho'
now secure in their Guilt, will one Day
find 'tis Murder of the blackest Dye; has
the least claim for Mercy, and calls aloud
for the severest Vengeance.</P>
<P>How many are yet to be sacrificed, unless
a speedy Stop be put to this most accursed
Practice I tremble to think; our Legisla∣ture
cannot take this Cause too soon in
hand: This surely cannot be below their
Notice, and 'twill be an easy matter at
once to suppress all these pretended Mad-Houses.
Indulge, gentle Reader, for once
the doting of an old Man, and give him
leave to lay down his little System with∣out
arraigning him of Arrogance or Am∣bition
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
to a be Law-giver. In my humble
Opinion all private Mad-Houses should be
suppress'd at once, and it should be no less
than Felony to confine any Person under
pretence of Madness without due Au∣thority.</P>
<P>For
the cure of those who are really
Lunatick, licens'd Mad-Houses should be
constituted in convenient Parts of the
Town, which Houses should be subject to
proper Visitation and Inspection, nor
should any Person be sent to a Mad-House
without due Reason, Inquiry and
Authority.</P>
<P>It may be objected, by Persons deter∣mined
to contradict every thing and approve
nothing, that the Abuses complained of
are not so numerous or heinous as I would
insinuate: Why are not Facts advanced,
they will be apt say, to give a Face of
Truth to these Assertions? but I have two
Reasons to the contrary; the first is, the
more you convince them the more angry
you make 'em, for they are never better
pleased than when they have an Opportu∣nity
of finding Fault: Therefore to curry
Favour with the Fault-finders, I have left
'em a loop Hole: the second and real is, be∣cause
I don't care to bring an old House over
my Head by mentioning particular Names
or special Cases, thereby drawing my
self into vexatious Prosecutions and Suits
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
at Law, from litigious Wretches, who
would be galled to find their Villainies
made publick; and stick at no Expence
or foul Play to revenge themselves. Not
but I could bring many Instances, particu∣larly
of an unhappy Widow, put in by a
Villain of a Husband, and now continued
in for the sake of her Jointure by her un∣natural
Son, FAR from common Ho∣nesty
or Humanity. Of another whose
Husband keeps his Mistress in black Vel∣vet,
and is seen with her every Night at
the Opera or Play, while his poor Wife,
(by much the finer Woman) and of an Un∣derstanding
far superior to her thick
Skull'd Tyrant, is kept mean in Diet and
Apparel, nay ill us'd into the Bargain;
notwithstanding her Fortune supplies all
the Villain's Extravagancies, and he has
not a Shilling but what came from her:
but a Beggar when once set on Horseback
proves always the most unmerciful RIDER.</P>
<P>I cannot leave this Subject without in∣serting
one particular Case.</P>
<P>A Lady of known Beauty, Vertue, and
Fortune, nay more, of Wisdom, not flashy
Wit, was, in the Prime of her Youth and
Beauty, and when her Senses were perfect∣ly
sound, carried by her Husband in his
Coach as to the Opera; but the Coachman
had other Instructions, and drove directly
to a Mad-House, where the poor innocent
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
Lady was no sooner introduced, under pre∣tence
of calling by the way to see some
Pictures he had a mind to buy, but the
Key was turn'd upon her, and she left a
Prisoner by her faithless Husband; who
while his injur'd Wife was confined and
us'd with the utmost Barbarity, He like a
profligate Wretch ran through her For∣tune
with Strumpets, and then, basely,
under Pretence of giving her Liberty,
extorted her to make over her Jointure:
which she had no sooner done but he
laugh'd in her Face, and left her to be
as ill us'd as ever. This he soon ran
through, and (happily for the Lady) died
by the Justice of Heaven in a Salivation his
Debauches had oblig'd him to undergo.</P>
<P>During her Confinement, the Villain of
the Mad-House frequently attempted her
Chastity; and the more she repuls'd him,
the worse he treated her: till at last he
drove her mad in good earnest. Her
distressed Brother, who is fond of her to
the last Degree, now confines her in part
of his own House, treating her with great
Tenderness; but has the Mortification to
be assured by the ablest Physicians, that his
poor Sister is irrecoverably distracted.</P>
<P>Numberless are the Instances I could
produce, but they would be accounted fic∣titious,
because I don't name the particular
Persons, for the Reasons before assigned;
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
but the Sufferings of these poor Ladies are
not fictitious, nor are the Villainy of these
Mad-Houses, or the unnatural, though fa∣shionable
Barbarity of Husbands Chi∣mira's,
but too solid Grievances and mani∣fest
Violations of the Laws of God and
Man.</P>

<P>I must beg my Reader's Indulgence, being

'tis true, I lay down a Scheme, but Fancy

and let the Subject, not the Stile or Me∣thod

<P>Return we therefore to complain of de∣structive
Gaming-Houses, the Bane of our
Youth, and Ruin of our Children and Ser∣vants.</P>
<P>This
is the most unprofitable Evil up∣on
Earth, for it only tends to alienate
the proper Current of Specie, to maintain
a pack of idle sharping Rascals, and beg∣gar
unwary Gentlemen and Traders.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
I take the Itch of gaming to be the most
pernicious of Vices, it is a kind of ava∣ritious
Madness; and if People have not
Sense to command themselves by Reason,
they ought to be restrained by Law:
Nor suffered to ruin themselves and Fa∣milies,
to enrich a Crew of Sharpers.</P>
<P>There is no playing on the Square with
these Villains; they are sure to cheat you,
either by slight of Hand, Confederacy, or
false Dice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have so much the
Odds of their infatuated Bubbles, that
they might safely play a Guinea to a Shil∣ling,
and yet be sure of winning. This
is but genteel Pocket-picking, or Felony
with another Name, and yet, so fond are
we of it, that from the Foot-boy to the
Lord, all must have a touch of gaming;
and there are Sharpers of different Stati∣ons
and Denominations, from <HI>Southwark
Fair</HI> to the <HI>Groom Porters.</HI> Shame, that
Gentlemen should suffer every Scoundrel
to mix with them for Gaming sake! And
equal Shame, that honest laborious Trades∣men
should be obstructed in crossing the
publick Streets, by the gilt Chariots of Va∣gabond
Gamesters; who now infest the
Land, and brave even our Nobility and
Gentry with their own Money!</P>
<P>But the most barbarous Part of this
hellish Trade, is what they call setting
of young Gentlemen, Apprentices, and
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
others; this ought to be deem'd Felony,
without Benefit of Clergy; for 'tis the
worst of Thievery. Under Pretence of
taking a Bottle, or spending an Evening
gayly, they draw their Cull to the Ta∣vern,
where they sit not long before the
Devil's Bones or Books are found acciden∣tally
on purpose, by the Help of which
they strip my Gentleman in an Instant,
and then generously lend him his own
Money, to lose a fresh, and create a Debt,
which is but too often more justly paid
than those more justly due.</P>
<P>If we look into some late Bankrupcies,
we shall find some noted Gamesters the
principal Creditors; I think, in such
Cases, 'twould be but Justice to make
void the Gamester's Debt, and subject his
Estate to make good the Deficiencies
of the Bankrupt's Effects. If Traders
have no more Wit, the Publick should
have Pity on 'em; and make it as penal
to lose as to win: And, in Truth, if
Cards, Dice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were totally suppress'd,
Industry and Arts would encrease the
more; Gaming may make a Man crafty,
but not polite; one may understand Cards
and Dice perfectly well, and be a Block∣head
in every Thing else.</P>
<P>I am sorry to see it so prevalent in the
City, among the trading Part of Man∣kind,
who have introduc'd it into their
Clubs, and Play so high of late, that
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
many Bankrupts have been made by this
pernicious Practice.</P>
<P>It is the Bane of all Conversation: And
those who can't sit an Hour without
Gaming, should never go into a Club to
spoil Company. In a Word, 'tis mere
Madness, and a most stupid Thing to
hazard ones Fortune, and perplex ones
Mind; nay, to sit up whole Nights,
poring over Toys of pipt Ivory and paint∣ed
Pasteboard, making our selves worse
than little Children, whose innocent Sports
we so much ridicule.</P>
<P>To sum up all, I think 'twould be a
noble Retribution, to subject Gamester's
Estates to the Use and Support of the poor
Widows and Orphans of their unfortunate
Bubbles.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> Debauches are Abuses that call
loud for Amendment: 'Tis in this perni∣cious
Soil the Seeds of Ruin are first
sown. Instead of a Day of Rest, we make
it a Day of Labour, by toiling in the De∣vil's
Vineyard; and but too many surfeit
themselves with the Fruits of Gluttony,
Drunkenness, and Uncleanness.</P>
<P>Not that I am so superciliously strict,
to have the Sabbath kept as rigidly here
as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but then there ought to be
a Medium between the Severity of a Fast,
and the Riot of <HI>Saturnalia.</HI> Instead of
a decent and chearful Solemnity, our Ta∣verns
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
and Publick-Houses have more Bu∣siness
that Day than all the Week beside.
Our Apprentices plume themselves; nay,
some scruple not to put on their Swords
and Tye Wigs, or Toupees; and the loose
End of the Town is their Rendezvous,
<HI>Sunday</HI> being Market-Day all round the
Hundreds of <HI>Drury.</HI></P>
<P>While we want Servants to do our
Work, those Hundreds, as they call 'em,
are crowded with Numbers of idle im∣pudent
Sluts, who love Sporting more
than Spinning, and inveigle our Youth to
their Ruin: Nay, many old Lechers
(Beasts as they are) steal from their Fa∣milies,
and seek these Harlot's lurking
Holes, to practice their unaccountable
Schemes of new invented Lewdnesses:
Some half hang themselves, others are
whipt, some lie under a Table and gnaw
the Bones that are thrown 'em, while
others stand slaving among a Parcel of
Drabs at a Washing-Tub. Strange that
the Inclination should not die with the
Power, but that old Fools should make
themselves the Prey and Ridicule of a
Pack of Strumpets!</P>
<P>Some heedless Youths are wheedled into
Marriage, which makes them and their
unhappy Parents miserable all their Lives;
others are drawn into Extravagancies, and
but too often run into their Master's Cash,
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
and for fear of a Discovery, make away
with themselves; or at least run away and
leave their distracted Parents in a Thou∣sand
Fears: Not to mention the Frustra∣tion
of their Fortune, and the Miseries
that attend a Vagabond Life. Thus ho∣nest
Parents lose their Children, and
Traders their Apprentices, and all from
a Liberty we have of late given our Youth
of rambling Abroad on <HI>Sundays:</HI> For many,
now a-days, will lie out all Night, or stay
out so late to give no small Disturbance in
sober Families. It therefore behoves every
Master of a Family to have his Servants
under his Eye: And if the going to Church,
Meeting, or whatever Place of Worship
suited their Religion, were more enforc'd,
it would be so much the better.</P>
<P>In short, the Luxury of the Age will
be the Ruin of the Nation, if not pre∣vented.
We leave Trade to game in
Stocks: We live above ourselves, and
barter our Ready-money for Trifles; Tea
and Wine are all we seem anxious for, and
God has given the Blessings of Life to an
ungrateful People, who despise their own
Productions. Our very Plough-Fellows
drink Wine now a-days: Our Farmers,
Grasiers, and Butchers, are above Malt-Liquors;
and the wholesome Breakfast of
Water-gruel and Milk-pottage is chang'd
for Coffee and Tea. This is the Reason
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
Provisions and Corn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are so dear; we
all work for Vintners, and raise our Prices
one upon another to such a Degree, 'twill
be an Impossibility to live, and we shall,
of Course, become our own Devourers.</P>
<P>We strain at a Gnat and swallow a
Camel: And, in this Instance, the Pub∣lick
Houses are kept open to furnish our
Luxury, while we deny ourselves other
Necessaries of Life, out of a Scruple of
Conscience. For Example; in extreme
hot Weather, when Meat will not keep
from <HI>Saturday</HI> to <HI>Sunday,</HI> we throw, or
cause to be thrown away, vast Quantities
of tainted Meat, and have generally stink∣ing
Dinners, because the Butchers dare
not sell a Joint of Meat on a <HI>Sunday</HI>
Morning. Now, tho' I would not have
the <HI>Sabbath</HI> so far violated as to have it
Market-Day, yet, rather than abuse God's
Mercies by throwing away Creatures
given for our Use, nay, for our own
Healths and Cleanliness Sake, I would
have the same Indulgence in extreme hot
Weather, as there is for Milk and Mack∣rell;
that is to say, that Meat might be
kill'd in the cool of the Morning, <HI>viz.</HI>
One or Two of the Clock, and sold 'till
Nine, and no longer: Nor should vil∣lainous
Informers have Power to molest
them in this innocent and reasonable
Amendment of a ridiculous vulgar Error.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44"/>
I cannot forbear taking Notice of the
extravagant Use, or rather Abuse of that
nauseous Liquor, call'd <HI>GENEVA,</HI>
among our lower sort. Those who deny,
that an inferior Class of People are most
necessary in a Body Politick, contradict
Reason and Experience itself, since they
are most useful when Industrious, and as
pernicious when lazy. By their Industry
our Manufactures, Trade, and Commerce
are carried on: The Merchant in his
Compting House, and the Captain in his
Cabbin would find but little Employment
were it not that many Hands carried on
the different Branches of the Concern
they superintended.</P>
<P>But now so far are our common People
infatuated with <HI>Geneva,</HI> that Half the
Work is not done now as formerly. It
debilitates and enervates them, and they
are not near so strong and healthy as for∣merly.
This accursed Liquor is in itself
so diuretick, it over-strains the Parts of
Generation, and makes our common
People incapable of getting such lusty
Children as they us'd to do. Add to this,
that the Women, by drinking it, spoil
their Milk, and by giving it to young
Children, as they foolishly do, spoil
the Stomach, and hinder Digestion; so
that in less than an Age, we may expect
a fine Spindle-shank'd Generation.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
There is not in Nature so unhealthy a
Liquor as <HI>Geneva,</HI> especially as common∣ly
sold: It curdles the Blood, it stupifies
the Senses, it weakens the Nerves, it spoils
the Eye-sight, and entirely ruins the Sto∣mach;
nay, some Stomachs have been
render'd so cold by the Use of <HI>Geneva,</HI>
that Lamp-Spirits have not been a Dram
warm enough for 'em. Surely they will
come to drink <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> at last!</P>
<P>On the contrary, our own Malt Liquors,
especially common Draught Beer, is most
wholesome and nourishing, and has
brought up better Generations than the
present: It is strengthening, cooling, and
balsamick: It helps Digestion, and car∣ries
Nourishment with it. And, in spight
of the Whims of some Physicians, is most
pertinent to a humane, especially a good
wholesome <HI>English</HI> Constitution. Nay,
the honest Part of the Faculty deny not
the Use of Small-Beer well brew'd, even
in Fevers. I my self have found great
Benefit by it; and if it be good in its Kind
'tis the finest Julap upon Earth.</P>
<P>If this Abuse of <HI>Geneva</HI> be not stopt,
we may go whoop for Husbandmen, La∣bourers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trade must consequently stand
still, and the Credit of the Nation sink:
Nor is the Abatement of the Excise, tho'
very considerable, and most worthy Notice,
any ways comparable to the Corruption of

Manners, the Destruction of Healt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
all the Train of Evils we are threaten'd
with from pernicious <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An effectual Method to prevent Street-Robberies.</HEAD>
<P>THE
principal Encouragements, and
Opportunity given to Street-Robbers
is, that our Streets are so poorly watch'd;
the Watchmen, for the most Part, being
decrepid, superannuated Wretches, with
one Foot in the Grave, and the t'other
ready to follow; so feeble, that a Puff
of Breath can blow 'em down: Poor crazy
Mortals! Much fitter for an Alms-house
than a Watch-house. A City watch'd and
guarded by such Animals, is wretchedly
watch'd indeed.</P>
<P>Nay, so little Terror do our Watchmen
carry with them, that hardy Thieves make
a mere Jest of 'em, and sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
even the very Watchmen, who should ap∣prehend
'em, to light 'em in their Roguery:
And what can a poor Creature do, in Ter∣ror
of his Life, surrounded by a Pack of
Ruffians, and no Assistance near.</P>
<P>Add to this, that our Rogues are grown
more wicked than ever, and Vice in all
Kinds is so much wink'd at, that Robbery
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
is accounted a petty Crime. We take pains
to puff 'em up in their Villainy, and Thieves
are set out in so amiable a Light in the
<HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> that it has taught them to
value themselves on their Profession, rather
than be asham'd of it.</P>
<P>There was some Cessation of Street-Robberies,
from the Time of <HI>Bunworth</HI>
and <HI>Blewitt</HI>'s Execution, 'till the Intro∣duction
of this pious Opera. Now we find
the <HI>Cartouchian</HI> Villainies revived, and
<HI>London,</HI> that us'd to be the most safe and
peaceful City in the Universe, is now a
Scene of Rapine and Danger. If some of
<HI>Cartouch</HI>'s Gang be not come over to in∣struct
our Thieves, and propagate their
Schemes, we have, doubtless, a <HI>Cartouch</HI>
of our own, and a Gang, which, if not
suppress'd, may be full as pernicious as ever
<HI>Cartouch</HI>'s was, and <HI>London</HI> will be as
dangerous as <HI>Paris,</HI> if due Care be not
taken.</P>
<P>We ought to begin our Endeavours to
suppress these Villainies; first by Heavenly,
and then by Earthly Means.</P>
<P>By Heavenly Means, in enforcing and
encouraging a Reformation of Manners, by
suppressing of Vice and Immorality, and
punishing Prophaneness and Licentiousness.
Our Youth are corrupted by filthy, lewd
Ballads, sung and sold publickly in our
Streets: Nay, unlicens'd and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stamp'd,
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
notwithstanding Acts of Parliament to the
contrary.</P>
<P>Coachmen, Carmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are indulg'd
in Swearing after the most blasphemous,
shocking, and unaccountable Rate that ever
was known. New Oaths and Blasphemies
are daily utter'd and invented, and rather
than not exercise this hellish Tallent, they
will vent their Curses on their very Horses;
and, Oh stupid! Damn the Blood of a
Post, rather than want something to curse.</P>
<P>Our common Women too have learn'd
this Vice; and not only Strumpets, but
labouring Women, who keep our Markets,
and vend Things about Street, swear and
curse at a most hideous Rate. Their Chil∣dren
learn it from the Parents, and those
of the middle, or even the better Sort of
People, if they pass through the Streets to
School, or to play, catch the Infection, and
carry home such Words as must conse∣quently
be very shocking to sober Parents.</P>
<P>Our Youth, in general, have too much
Liberty; the Sabbath is not kept with
due Solemnity; Masters and Mistresses of
Families are too remiss in the Care of the
Souls committed to their Charge. Family
Prayer is neglected; and, to the Shame of
Scoffers be it spoken, too much ridiculed.
All Ages and Sexes, if in Health, should
be obliged to attend publick Worship, ac∣cording
to their respective Opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="49"/>
Were it only to keep Youth out of Harm's
Way, it would do well. But it is to be
hoped, if their Parents, Masters, or Mi∣stresses
should oblige their Attendance at
publick Devotion, they would edify by
what they should hear, and many wicked
Acts would be stifled in their Infancy,
and check'd even in the Intention, by
good and useful Doctrine.</P>
<P>Our common People make it a Day of
Debauch, and get so drunk on a Sunday,
they cannot work for a Day or two fol∣lowing.
Nay, since the Use of Geneva
has become so common, many get so often
drunk they cannot work at all, but run
from one Irregularity to another, 'till at
last they become arrant Rogues. And
this is the Foundation of all our present
Complaints.</P>
<P>We will suppose a Man able to maintain
himself and Family by his Trade, and at
the same Time to be a Geneva-drinker:
This Fellow first makes himself inca∣pable
of working, by being continually
drunk; this runs him behind-hand, and
he either pawns or neglects his Work, for
which Reason no Body will employ him.
At last, Fear of Arrests, his own Hunger,
the Cries of his Family for Bread, his na∣tural
Desire to support an irregular Life,
and a propense Hatred to Labour, turn
but too many an honest Tradesman into
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
an arrant desperate Rogue: And these are
commonly the Means that furnish us with
Thieves and Villains in general.</P>
<P>Thus is a Man, that might be useful
in a Body politick, render'd obnoxious to
the same: And if this Trade of Wicked∣ness
goes on, they will grow and encrease
upon us, insomuch, that we shall not
dare to stir out of our Habitations; nay, it
will be well if they arrive not to the Im∣pudence
of plundering our Houses at
Noon day.</P>
<P>Where is the Courage of the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, that a Gentleman, with Six or
Seven Servants, shall be robb'd by one
single Highwayman? Yet we have lately
had Instances of this; and for this we may
thank our Effeminacy, our Toupee Wigs,
and powder'd Pates, our Tea, and other
scandalous Fopperies; and above all, the
Disuse of noble and manly Sports, so ne∣cessary
to a brave People, once in Vogue,
but now totally lost among us.</P>
<P>Let not the Reader think I run from
my Subject, if I search the Bottom of the
Distemper before I propose a Cure, which
having done, tho' indeed but slightly, for
this is an Argument could be carried to
a much greater Length, I proceed next to
propose Earthly Means in the Manner fol∣lowing.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="51"/>
Let the Watch be composed of stout
able bodied Men, and of those at least
treble the Number now subsisting, that
is to say, a Watchman to every Forty
Houses, Twenty on one Side of the Way,
and Twenty on the other; for it is ob∣servable,
that a Man cannot well see di∣stinctly
beyond the Extent of Twenty
Houses in a Row; if 'tis a single Row,
and no opposite Houses, the Charge must
be greater, and their Safety less. This
Man should be elected, and paid by the
Housekeepers themselves, to prevent Mis∣application
and Abuse, so much complain'd
of, in the Distribution of Publick Money.</P>
<P>He should be allow'd 10<HI>s. per Annum,</HI>
by each Housekeeper, which at Forty
Houses, as above specify'd, amounts to
20<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> almost treble to what is
at present allow'd; and yet most House∣keepers
are charg'd at least 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> a
Quarter to the Watch, whose beat is, ge∣nerally
speaking, little less than the Com∣pass
of half a Mile.</P>
<P>This Salary is something of Encourage∣ment,
and a pretty Settlement to a poor
Man, who, with Frugality, may live de∣cently
thereon, and, by due Rest, be
enabled to give vigilant Attendance.</P>
<P>If a Housekeeper break, or a House is
empty, the poor Watchman ought not to
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
suffer, the Deficiency should be made up
by the Housekeepers remaining.</P>
<P>Or, indeed, all Housekeepers might be
excus'd, if a Tax of only 1<HI>s. per Annum</HI>
were levied on every Batchelor within the
Bills of Mortality, and above the Age of
One and Twenty, who is not a House∣keeper;
for these young Sparks are a
Kind of unprofitable Gentry to the State;
they claim publick Safety and Advantages,
and yet pay nothing to the Publick, nay
indeed, they, in a Manner, live upon the
Publick, for (on a <HI>Sunday</HI> especially) at
least a Million of these Gentlemen quar∣ter
themselves upon the married Men,
and rob many Families of part of a Week's
Provision, more particularly when they
play a good Knife and Fork, and are of
the Family of the <HI>Tuckers.</HI></P>
<P>I beg Pardon for this whimsical Propo∣sal,
which, ludicrous as it seems, has
something in it; and may be improved.
Return we, in the mean Time, to our
Subject.</P>
<P>The Watch thus station'd, strengthen'd,
and encourag'd, let every Watchman be
arm'd with Fire-Arms and Sword; and
let no Watchman stand above Twenty
Doors distant from his Fellow.</P>
<P>Let each Watchman be provided with
a Bugle-Horn, to sound on Alarm, or in
Time of Danger; and let it be made pe∣nal,
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
if not Felony, for any but a Watch∣man
to sound a Horn in and about the
City, from the Time of their going on,
to that of their going off.</P>
<P>An Objection will be here made on
Account of the Post-Boys, to obviate
which, I had Thoughts of a Bell, but
that would be too ponderous and trouble∣some
for a Watchman to carry, besides
his Arms and Lanthorn. As to a fix'd
Bell, if the Watchman is at another Part
of his Walk, how can he give Notice?
Besides, Rogues may play Tricks
with the Bell; whereas a Horn is portable,
always ready, and most alarming.</P>
<P>Let the Post-Boys, therefore, use some
other Signal, since this is most convenient
to this more material Purpose. They
may carry a Bell in a Holster, with Ease,
and give Notice by that, as well as those
who collect the Letters.</P>
<P>That the Watchmen may see from one
End of their Walks to the other, let a
convenient Number of Lamps be set up,
and those not of the Convex Kind, which
blind the Eyes, and are of no manner of
Use; they dazzle, but give no distinct
Light: And farther, rather than prevent
Robberies. Many, deceiv'd and blinded
by these <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> have been run over
by Coaches, Carts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> People stumble
more upon one another, even under these
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
very Lamps, than in the Dark. In short,
they are most unprofitable Lights, and,
in my Opinion, rather Abuses than Bene∣fits.</P>
<P>Besides,
I see no Reason why every Ten
Housekeepers can't find a Lamp among
themselves, and let their Watchman dress
it, rather than fatten a crew of Directors:
But we are so fond of Companies, 'tis a
Wonder we have not our Shooes black'd
by one, and a Set of Directors made rich
at the Expence of our very Black-guards.
Convenient Turn-pikes and Stoppages
may be made to prevent Escapes, and it
will be proper for a Watchman to be
plac'd at one of these, fix'd at the End of
a Lane, Court, Alley, or other Thorough∣fare,
which may happen in any Part of
his Beat, and so as not to obstruct his
View to both Ends thereof, or being able
to give Notice, as aforesaid; for the
Watch ought to be in View, as well as in
the Hearing of each other, or they may
be overpower'd, and much Danger may
happen.</P>
<P>The Streets thus guarded and illumi∣nated,
what remains, but that the Money
allotted by the Government be instantly
paid on Conviction of every Offender;
for Delays in this Case are of dangerous
Consequence, and no Body will venture
their Lives in Hopes of a Reward, if it
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
be not duly and timely paid. If there is
Reason of Complaint on this Head, it
ought to be look'd into by those at the
Helm; for nothing can be more vile than
for Underlings to abuse the Benevolence
of the Publick, or their Superiors, by sink∣ing,
abridging, or delaying publick or
private Benefits. And it is by no Means
below the Dignity, or Care, even of the
greatest, to see the Disposal of their own
Bounty and Charity; for it loses but too
often by the Carriage: And where a
Nobleman, or other generous Person, has
order'd Five Guineas to be given, 'tis well
if the proper Object has had even One.</P>
<P>Something allow'd by the Chamber of
<HI>London,</HI> to every Person apprehending a
Robber, would have a good Effect, espe∣cially
if it be not told over a Gridiron,
but paid without Delay, or Abatement.
And what if the fewer Custards are eat, so
it augment the Publick Safety.</P>
<P>Some of our common Soldiery are (and
I hope unjustly) suspected. This may be
easily confuted, if strict Orders are en∣forc'd,
that none but Commission, or
Warrant Officers shall be out of their
Quarters after Ten at Night. But if we
consider, that neither <HI>Blewit, Bunworth,</HI>
or their Gangs, were Soldiers, and that of
those who have been executed for Ten
Years past, not One in Ten were Soldiers,
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
but, on the contrary, Seamen discharg'd,
and thrown on the Publick, without pre∣sent
Subsistence, which made them des∣perate:
But I hope the Act now depend∣ing
for the Encouragement of Seamen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
will sufficiently remove that Obstacle also.
This, I hope, will stop the Mouths of
censorious Persons, who unjustly arraign
our Soldiery for the Vices of others:
However, to make all easy, I believe the
Generality of them will gladly submit to
the Restraint propos'd, merely to show
their Innocence.</P>
<P>Mean Time, would his most sacred
Majesty let them partake of his Bounty,
as the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have done, and raise
their Pay, were it but One Penny <HI>per
Diem,</HI> it would be a most Royal Bounty,
would considerably contribute to their
Support, and put them above any sordid
Views: And there was never more Occa∣sion
than now, when Provisions of all
Kinds are so excessive dear.</P>
<P>Having offer'd my little Mite to the
Publick, I beg they will excuse the Defi∣ciency
of my Stile, and Multitude of my
Errors, for my Intention's Sake. I write
without Prospect of Gain: If I am cen∣sured,
'tis what I can but expect; but if,
among all my Schemes, One proves of
Service, my Desires and Labours are
amply answer'd.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
<HEAD>OMISSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN my Scheme for an University in
<HI>London,</HI> I proposed only a Hall or
publick Room; on Recollection I find it
should be a large House or Inn, in the Na∣ture
of a College, with store of conve∣nient
Rooms for Gentlemen, not only to
study separately, but wherein to lodge
their Books, for 'twould be most inconve∣nient
to lug them backwards and forwards:
They may indeed Breakfast, Sup, and Sleep
at Home, but 'twill be highly necessary
they should dine in Commons, or at least
near the College; not that I would have
Cooks, Butlers, Caterers, Manciples, and
the whole Train of College Cannibals re∣tained;
but for fear they should stay too
long at Home, or be hindred from return∣ing
to Study in due time, some proper
Place or Person might be pitch'd upon to
keep an Ordinary at a prefix'd Price and
Hour, and for the Students only.</P>
<P>My Reasons are these:<LIST>
<ITEM>First, A young Gentleman may live too
far from College.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Second, The College Hours for Dinner,
may not agree with those of the Family.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="59" REF="58"/>Third, Company may drop in and de∣tain
him.</ITEM>
</LIST> These being, I think, the only mate∣rial
Objections could be offered, I hope I
have amply provided against them, and
rendered my Project more perfect and un∣exceptionable.</P>
<P>One
Omission I made in the Discourse on
Mad-Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is, that Maiden Ladies
as well as Widows and Wives, are liable
to the Inquisition there complained of,
and I am inform'd a good Estate is lately
come to a worthless Family, by the Death,
or rather Murder of an innocent young
Creature, who being left very rich, chose
to live with her Friends; but well had it
been for her, had she taken up her Abode
among Strangers, for they stay'd off all
Proposals for Marriage a considerable time,
and when at last they found the Lady
would not be hindered from altering her
Condition, she was hurried away to a
Mad-House, where she miserably ended
her Days, while they rioted in the Pillage
of her Fortune. Thus neither Maid,
Wife or Widdow, are safe, while these
accursed Mad-Houses are suffered: Nay, I
see no Reason, (if the Age improves in
Wickedness, as in all Probability it may)
but the Men, <HI>per Contra,</HI> may take their
Turns. Younger Brothers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may clap
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
up their Elders and jump into their Estates,
for there are no Questions ask'd at these
Mad-Houses, but who is the Pay-master,
and how much; give them but their
Price, mad or not mad 'tis no matter
whom they confine; so that if any Person
lives longer than his Relations think con∣venient,
they know their Remedy, 'tis
but sending them to a Mad-House and
the Estate's their own.</P>
<P>Having answer'd all that I think liable
to Objection, and recollected what I had
omitted, I desire to stand or fall by the
Judgment of the serious Part of Mankind;
wherein they shall correct me I will kiss
the Rod and suffer with Patience; but if
a pack of Hackney Scriblers shall attack
me only by way of a get-Penny, I shall
not be provoked to answer them be they
never so scurrilous, lest I be accounted as
one of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall congratulate you on your Electi∣on
into the Chamberlainship of the
City of <HI>London,</HI> or otherwise, as you shall
acquit your self in answering candidly and
impartially to the following Queries.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether there is not Money sufficient
in the Chamber of <HI>London</HI> to pay off the
Orphan's Fund? Or if not a sufficient Sum,
What Sum it is, and what is the Defici∣ency?
How long it has lain there, and
what Interest has been made upon it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. If there are not considerable Arrears
due from many Wards, and what those
Arrears are?</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="62" REF="61"/>
III. Who are these poor Orphans we pay
so much Money to? And whether they
are not some of the richest Men in the City
of <HI>London,</HI> who have got the Stock into
their own Hands, and find it so snug a
Fund, they do not care to get out of it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. If it would not be much better to
gather in the Arrears, join 'em to the Mo∣ney
in the Office, and collect the Overplus
at once, rather than suffer the Tax to be∣come
eternal, and to pay so much Interest?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This is but a reasonable Request; and
if Col. <HI>Robinson</HI> is the honest Gentleman
Fame reports him to be, he will make no
Scruple to give a ready Answer. And in∣deed
it will be but a handsome Return
made to his Fellow Citizens, for their
Choice of him, to begin his Office with
such an Act of Justice, Honesty, and pub∣lick
Satisfaction. For many People don't
know what is meant by the Orphan's Tax:
They pay it with Remorse, and think
themselves aggrieved. Even those who
know the Reason of the Fund think it has
been continued long enough, wish it were
once paid off, suspect some Secret in the
Affair, and give their Tongues the Liberty
all Losers claim: <HI>Our Fathers,</HI> say they,
<HI>have eaten four Grapes, and our Teeth are
set on Edge, we are visited for their
Transgressions, and may be to the World's</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
<HI>End, unless we find an honest Chamber∣lain
who will unveil this cloudy Affair,
and give us a Prospect of Relief.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Sir, it lies at your Door to gain
the Applause of the whole City (a few
Misers excepted) by a generous and Gen∣tleman-like
Discovery of this Affair. And
you are thus publickly call'd upon, that
your Discovery may be as publick and bene∣ficial
to all. If you comply, I shall think
you an honest Man, above a Fellow-feeling,
or being byass'd, and most worthy your
Office: If not, give me Leave to think,
the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> have made but an
indifferent Choice. I am,</P>
