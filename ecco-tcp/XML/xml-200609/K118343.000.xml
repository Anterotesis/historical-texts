<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU request from me, with infinitely more
importunity than the thing is worth, a
copy of the short comparison between Mr.
Fox's India Bill and Mr. Pitt's, which I read
in my place in the House of Commons in the
last day's debate upon the Declaratory Act.
I now send it to you, with a number of notes
or observations, which I have been induced
to add to it, from a desire of complying more
fully with what I conceive to be your object in
asking for the paper. I have been led into
more length than I intended on the subject,
and this must be my apology for not having
obeyed your commands sooner.</P>
<P>You will perceive, however, that I have
not, in these remarks, paid your judgment so
ill a compliment as to have endeavoured to
engage your attention by laboured argu∣ments;
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
still less by any attempt at ornament.
I have endeavoured merely to be intelligible,
and to confine the illustrations I adopt, to
facts. If, upon the whole, you should be of
opinion that these papers contain a fair state∣ment
of the true meaning of the two Bills,
and some just comments upon that meaning,
they are at your disposal to be put into any
person's hands you please, or to be given to
the public, if it is thought worth while to
do so.</P>
<P>The comparison itself I wrote in the House
of Commons during the debate, from feeling
it, I confess, a teazing circumstance to hear
gentlemen of the most respectable abilities day
after day arguing upon, and drawing paral∣lels
between, the provisions of the two Bills,
upon which it was perfectly obvious they had
not condescended to bestow any very minute
degree of attention: and conceiving it to be
no very difficult task to reduce the discussion
to a plain and concise statement of fact.
With regard to Mr. Fox's Bill, I do venture
peremptorily to assert, that there never was
a legislative measure so little examined, so
generally misunderstood, and so confidently
misrepresented.</P>
<P>You acknowledge yourself to be one of
those who have been in some degree of error
on the subject; and you confess that you
now begin to see the measure itself, as well
as the conduct of those who opposed it, in a
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
new point of view; and that you meet with
many who confess the same. Nay, some even
of those who were formerly most violent on
this topic, have in your hearing acknowledg∣ed,
you say, (and you seem to expect me to
triumph in the intelligence), that "Mr. Pitt's
Bill is very like, if not quite as bad as Mr.
Fox's."—You will forgive my saying, how∣ever,
that this is a compromise which we ne∣ver
shall accept, even as the overture of re∣turning
confidence from those whose good
opinion we most regretted to lose. In fact,
there is no resemblance between the two Bills
in any circumstance, excepting only the little
ceremony with which they both treated the
Charter of the Company; nor could any per∣son
who supported Mr. Fox's Bill, and still
approves the measure, give his countenance
to Mr. Pitt's, with the smallest degree of con∣sistency.—But examine the subject fairly
yourself upon the plain ground of fact.—I
will not attempt to bias your opinion by any
previous argument.</P>
<P>You will receive with this a copy of the
other Bill brought in by Mr. Fox, (which
you say you never saw) intitled, "A Bill for
the better Government of the Territorial
Possessions and Dependencies in India."
This Bill accompanied what is usually called
"<HI>Mr. Fox's India Bill,</HI>" but is seldom men∣tioned,
altho' it formed a very essential part
of the plan; and the consideration of it is
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
extremely necessary to the understanding the
principle, and main object of the system.</P>
<P>I send you also a copy of Mr. Pitt's Bill, as
it came out of the Committee, when it was
re-printed, with its alterations and amend∣ments.
In looking it over, I do not desire
you to take notice of the ludicrous manner
in which it is pieced and patched, and cor∣rected
and altered, almost from the beginning
to the end, merely to convince you of the sad
slovenly style in which the act was framed,
but in order that you may compare the spirit
and obvious purpose of some of these altera∣tions,
with the text as it first stood; by doing
which you will be much better enabled to
judge of the true meaning of the original Act,
than by any thing you can learn from the De∣claratory
Law.</P>
<P>As to the Declaratory Law itself, and the
plea which was made for it,—we seem to be
perfectly agreed upon that subject. The pa∣pers
laid before the House of Commons, cer∣tainly
contain, as you observe, a complete
refutation of all the pretences upon which the
sending out the four regiments to India was
defended as <HI>a measure of necessity.</HI> And still
more strongly do I agree with you in your
remarks upon <HI>Declaratory Acts</HI> in general,
and upon the nature of this Declaratory Act
in particular. It is indeed an alarming and
an unfortunate event in the History of Parli∣ament
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>—for it is one that shakes the founda∣tion
of that security which all men hope from
Law, and of that respect which all men owe
to it—to see the Representatives of the people
persuaded to intercept the ordinary course of
justice, to assume themselves a judicial cha∣racter,
and, upon the suggestion of the King's
Ministers, to determine a question of proper∣ty,
in favour of the servants of the Crown,
against the claims of the subject!</P>
<P>Nor can our apprehensions of the conse∣quences
of this precedent be diminished, by
reflecting upon the manner in which the
measure was carried thro' the House of Lords;
by reflecting, that the supreme court of judi∣cature
in this country should have been in∣duced
by any influence or by any eloquence,
or upon any plea of necessity, pretended or
real, to decide—with unparalleled precipita∣tion,—upon a construction of law—in the
absence of the Judges of the land, and with∣out
granting a hearing to the parties interest∣ed
in their decision!</P>
<P>Yet possibly you will be surprised when I
add, that it is <HI>because</HI> I perfectly and cordially
agree with you in your observations upon
these proceedings, that I do not so readily
adopt the conclusion you have drawn with
regard to the advantage which, "the ex-par∣ty"
(I use your own phrase) is supposed to
have obtained in consequence of the weak
conduct of the Administration in this busi∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
If this party,—whose general principles,
fidelity of attachment, and openness of con∣duct,
you own you respect—but own it with
the splenetic reluctance of one who has been
in vain endeavouring to look for system, uni∣nion,
or plain dealing elsewhere—If this par∣ty
had no other object but to retort popular
invectives, to detect the sinister views of po∣litical
adversaries, to lessen the confidence of
Parliament in their measures, or to shake the
opinion of their consequence in another quar∣ter,
there undoubtedly was cause for consi∣derable
triumph in the late events:—and of
still fairer triumph, perhaps, in the opportu∣nity
afforded of vindicating their own cha∣racters
under circumstances of great advan∣tage,
and upon grounds the most embarras∣sing
to their opponents. But understanding,
as I trust I do, the terms and conditions up∣on
which alone that party will ever seek to
obtain, or consent to hold, ministerial situa∣tions
in this country, I never shall admit that
their cause can be essentially advanced by any
legislative measure which tends to lower the
House of Commons in the public estimation,
and to deprive Parliament of the respect and
confidence of the country.</P>
<P>Upon such occasions, whatever advantage
this or that set of men may gain in debate,
or in public opinion,—<HI>Their</HI>'s only is the tri∣umph,
who love not the popular part of our
Constitution, whose credit and whose prin∣ciples
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
prosper in the abasement of all popular
character, and who would at any time be
content to participate in the reproach of an
odious measure, provided it reflected superi∣or
disgrace on Parliament, as the instrument
of effecting it.—But I am getting upon
ground which may lead us from the subject
I wish to press to your more immediate at∣tention.—I shall therefore only add, that
I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>With great truth and regard,
Your sincere,
And obedient servant,

<HEAD>COPY of a PAPER read by Mr.
Sheridan in the HOUSE OF COM∣MONS,
on <HI>Friday</HI> the 14th Day of
March, 1788.</HEAD>
<P>THE PROFESSED OBJECT of the Two Bills
for the better Government of the British Possessions
in India, brought into Parliament, the one by Mr.
FOX, in 1783, and the other by Mr. PITT, in
1784, was to relieve the Natives of that Country,
from the many evils which they had experienced un∣der
the Dominion of, or in consequence of their Con∣nection
with, the Government of the Company of the
United Merchants trading to the East-Indies. It
was assumed by the Framers of both Bills, that this
Relief was not to be expected from the Government
of the Company, constituted as it then was; and it
was admitted by both, that the Patronage and Influ∣ence
of the Company ought not to be transferred to the
Crown.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

<P>MR. FOX's BILL
"<HI>discontinued</HI>" the pow∣ers
and authorities of the
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Company for the term
of four years, and trans∣ferred
those powers, and
no more, or others, for
the said term, to seven
Directors, named by
Parliament, to be by
them exercised "in <HI>trust</HI>
for, and for <HI>the benefit
of the said Company.</HI>"</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill did not

originating and directing
the measures themselves.</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill did not
pretend at once to divide
the commercial from the
political interests, or the
trade from the revenues
of the Company; and did
therefore provide, that
nine "Assistant Direc∣tors,"
nominated by
Parliament "from a∣mong
the Proprietors
of East India Stock,"
should form "a Board
for the sole purpose of
ordering and manag∣ing
the commerce of
the said united Com∣pany,"

Board.</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill did not

in any respect upon the
consent of the Company,
nor to produce a system
of reform agreeable to,
or concerted with, those
whose abuse of power it
professed to remedy.</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill esta∣blished
no <HI>fourth estate,</HI>

to the Directors therein
named, which did not

but on the con∣trary,
did limit and re∣strain
the said Directors,
so appointed by Parlia∣ment,
in various parti∣culars
in which the Com∣pany's
Directors were
not before restrained.</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill, so far
from placing the Direc∣tors
named by Parlia∣ment,
above the execu∣tive
Government of the
Country, and out of the
reach of its inspection
and controul, did expres∣ly
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
and distinctly place
them under the same
obligation to communi∣cate
their transactions to
his Majesty's Ministers
for the time being, and
did expressly and dis∣tinctly
make them sub∣ordinate

to his Majesty's pleasure,
and to the directions of
his Ministers, in the same
manner, and upon the
same footing, and "un∣der
the same limita∣tions
and restrictions,"
as the Regulating Act of
1773, and the Act of
1781, and various other
Acts, had placed the

the Company.</P>

<P>Earl Fitzwilliam, and

of State, they were

the whole of the powers

of the Legislature and of
the public.</P>

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill esta∣blished
no system of <HI>my∣stery</HI>
and <HI>concealment</HI> in
the management of af∣fairs,
of any sort; but,
on the contrary, did ex∣pressly
provide, that the
conduct of the Board,
established by that Bill,
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
should be clear and o∣pen;
that their opinions
should "be given in no
covert manner," and,
that their motives of
conduct, as well as their
measures, should stand
"recorded on their jour∣nals,
signed with the
name of each Direc∣tor;"
thereby making
them responsible to Par∣liament
and to their
Country, by the best
pledge and security for
responsibility,—an ex∣plicit
avowal of their
purposes, at the time
they resolved on their
measures.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="K" TYPE="section">

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill avowed
its object clearly and dis∣tinctly;

with such plainness

no room for misconstruc∣tion,

in the minds of
any but of those who
would not take the trou∣ble

<P>Mr. Fox's Bill was a
measure of experiment;
the term of duration li∣mited
to four years; and
during that period the
affairs of the Company
were placed so immedi∣ately
and intelligibly un∣der
the eye of Parlia∣ment,
that a permanent
and well digested system
for the future govern∣ment
of those valuable
possessions might reason∣ably
have been expected
from the wisdom of the
Legislature, before that
term should have been
expired. A system that
might have restored to
the Company all rights

<P>" <HI>Patronage in the hands of the Company</HI>—"] The
purposes to which the Board of Controul may ap∣ply
their power, and the connexion of that power
with Patrouage, is strongly exemplified in their
dispute with the Directors, relative to the settle∣ment
of the Nabob of Arcot's debts to individuals,
amounting to nearly four millions sterling. The
Directors, in pursuance of <Q REND="inline">the positive injunc∣tions
of Mr. Pitt's Bill,</Q> conceiving themselves
<Q REND="inline">indispensably bound to direct an inquiry to be
instituted into the justice and origin of these
debts,</Q> draw up their Orders to the Presidency
of Madras accordingly. They soon learn, howe∣ver,
that they have another master stronger than
the law; for the Board of Controul compel them
to admit the whole of these debts without any such
investigation as the law directed. The Directors
remonstrate in vain. Contrary to what they de∣clare
to be their sense of the trust reposed in them,
contrary to what they conceive to be their duty
under the law, they are compelled to execute the
orders of the Board of Controul, as if they had
been grounded on their own judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts and con∣viction.—The Commissioners further adding—

<P>" <HI>Nominating or Appointing—</HI>"] IT has been
urged, that Mr. Pitt's Bill had the merit of ex∣pressly
<HI>directing</HI> a reduction of the establishments
in India, and of restricting both the Directors and
the Board of Controul from sending out <HI>new</HI> ser∣vants.
Not even a Cadet beyond what was <Q REND="inline">ac∣tually
necessary to keep up the proper comple∣ment
of officers upon the reduced establishment,</Q>
was to be permitted to sail from England.—No such restriction undoubtedly was imposed upon
the Directors to be appointed under Mr. Fox's
Bill. Parliament conceived that they had a better
security; and the event has shewn that they could
not have taken a worse. This cannot be placed in
a stronger light than by supposing that Lord Fitz∣william,
and his associates in the new arrangement,
had called aloud for checks to be imposed upon
them; had solicited to be restrained from the power
of dissipating the Company's revenue, and creating
a Military Patronage at <HI>their</HI> expence; had taken
credit for tying up their own hands in their own
Bill; and—within a short time after, while the
Company had <HI>six hundred officers</HI> reduced by the
Peace establishment in India, had created an op∣portunity
for sending out <HI>eighty six</HI> NEW <HI>officers,</HI>
APPOINTED BY THEMSELVES, at an expence to the
Company of 50,000l per annum in peace, and
86,000l. per annum in war, without a single plea
or pretence which would not have been better an∣swered
by <HI>sending out the man without the officers!</HI></P>
<P><HI>A right of recalling every Person.</HI>] IN October
1784, the Directors inform the Board of Con∣troul,
that they have appointed John Holland, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
an old servant of the Company, to succeed to the
Government of Fort St. George, upon the death,
removal, or resignation of Lord Macartney.</P>
<P>The Board of Controul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Directors' <HI>right
of appointment,</HI> but remonstrate against the nomi∣nation
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
upon certain grounds; giving Mr. Holland,
however, due praise, they add, that it is their
<Q REND="inline">wish to enforce to the Directors, the propriety
in every appointment, not only of avoiding
blameable appointments, but such as may be
open to <HI>plausible misrepresentation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Directors maintain their right, and observe
that the Board are interfering in matters, <Q REND="inline">to
which their controul professedly does not ex∣tend</Q>
The Board of Controul withdraw their
opposition with saying, <Q REND="inline">if the reasons which we
have assigned do not satisfy the Court of Direc∣tors,
we have certainly no right to controul
their opinion.</Q> Mr. Holland, however is pe∣remptorily
informed, that if he sails for India
under the Directors appointment, he will be <HI>re∣called</HI>
the instant he arrives there.—The dispute
ends; and Sir Archibald Campbell, the friend of
Mr. DUNDAS, by a due exertion of the avowed
<HI>weight of influence,</HI> is appointed in his place!</P>
<P><HI>Censure and applause.</HI>] IN July 1785, the Di∣rectors
reprimanded Colonel Ross, for what they
maintained to be an outrageous contempt of their
authority. The Board of Controul alter the dis∣patch,
and refuse to let the reprimand stand. The
Directors remonstrate, and declare that <Q REND="inline">the pre∣sent
occasion appears to them so momentous, and
a <HI>submission on their part, so destructive of all order
and subordination in India,</HI> that they must take
the liberty of informing the Right Honourable
Board, that no dispatch can be sent to India
which does not contain their (the Directors)
final decision on Lieutenant Colonel Ross.</Q></P>
<P>The matter is compromised—with a declaration

<P><HI>Suspending and rewarding.</HI>] IN July 1787, the
Court of Directors disapprove of certain allowan∣ces,
or gratuities, made to Sir John Dalling by
the Government of Fort St. George; and tell
their President, that, upon a full examination of
the matter, they think <HI>he has acted improperly.</HI> The
Board of Controul new model the dispatch, and
oblige the Directors to say, that upon <HI>mature consi∣deration</HI>
they are <HI>perfectly satisfied</HI>: assuring them,
that if they will peruse their <HI>own papers again,</HI> they,
(the Board of Controul,) are persuaded <Q REND="inline">you will
be disposed to alter your opinion even more
than we have altered your dispatch.</Q></P>
<P>The Court of Directors, "alarmed," (as they
express themselves, in a case of a similar nature
respecting Colonel Geils's allowances,) <Q REND="inline">at the
Board's exercising a <HI>power over their purse,</HI> not
conceiving it to have been the intention of
the Act to give the Board such a power,</Q> re∣monstrate
respectfully upon the occasion, and de∣clare,
that <Q REND="inline">they have <HI>endeavoured</HI> to adhere to a
<HI>system of oeconomy</HI> which the condition of their
finances require, and the Legislature has thought
fit to command, and should be happy to meet
the approbation and support of the Right Ho∣nourable
Board therein. The Act of Parliament,</Q> they add, <Q REND="inline"> we conceive, meant to vest in your
Right Honourable Board, a controuling power,
respecting the <HI>great objects</HI> of the government of
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
the Company's affairs, and to leave <HI>the liquida∣tion
of accounts for services performed,</HI> and <HI>all such
details,</HI> in the Court of Directors.</Q></P>
<P>The Board of Controul inform them—that they
<Q REND="inline">continue to be of their former opinion</Q>—they
are at a loss to understand the grounds of objection
<Q REND="inline">to their <HI>right of controul</HI> in this business, as the
claims of Sir John Dalling, though he is now
out of your service, are founded upon his right
when he was in your service, and are to be paid
out of the <HI>Revenues of India</HI>; and of course, <HI>your
opinions</HI> upon them must be subject to <HI>our revi∣sion.</HI></Q>
The Directors finding themselves without
a remedy, answer,—<Q REND="inline">We feel ourselves under
the <HI>necessity of acquiescing</HI> in the determination of
your Right Honourable Board. But we trust
upon further consideration your Right Honou∣rable
Board will not make such allowances, a
<HI>perpetual charge</HI> upon the Company.</Q></P>
<P>With these instances, thus briefly stated, selected
from a number of similar cases, and relating to
the powers exercised by the Board of Controul,
with respect to <HI>civil appointments, censure</HI> and <HI>ap∣plause,</HI>
<HI>reward</HI> and <HI>punishment, military promotion,</HI>
and <HI>the purse</HI> of the Company; will it be credited,
that any many should have been stout enough to
assert in the House of Commons, that <Q REND="inline">the <HI>whole
business of Patronage</HI> was left <HI>exclusively</HI> in the
hands of the <HI>Company,</HI> and that the Board of
Controul would not even take it if it were offer∣ed
to them!!!</Q></P>
<P>In truth, the question, <Q REND="inline">Whether or not the
present Board of Controul possess the whole, or
any share of the Patronage in India?</Q> has lately
been placed in a plainer light by the unguarded
confessions of those who supported the Declaratory
Bill, than by any thing that could be said by those
who opposed it. Some gentlemen defined the au∣thority
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
of the Board on this head to be, <Q REND="inline"><HI>a power
of circuitous nomination</HI>;</Q> others, <Q REND="inline"><HI>appointment
by the weight of influence</HI>;</Q> others, <Q REND="inline"><HI>the right of
authoritative recommendation</HI>;</Q> but by whatever
name it is called, or however the exercise of it
may be disclaimed, these facts are plain, 1st, That
all the unbounded means of Patronage and Protec∣tion
which the <HI>Governor General</HI> and the Presidents
of the different Councils possess, belong to those
to whom in reality they owe their appointments,
and to whom only in fact they owe obedience.
2dly, That the Board of Controul are obviously
seizing the whole of the <HI>Military</HI> Patronage into
their own hands, the intention of extinguishing the
Company's service being plainly avowed. 3dly,
That no person can look for protection to any
quarter but to <HI>the Board,</HI> or think of accepting any
appointment against <HI>their</HI> will, in the <HI>civil</HI> line.</P>
<P>One distinction, however, is constantly taken
upon this subject, namely, that Mr. Pitt's Com∣missioners
do not meddle with the <HI>Patronage at
home,</HI> which it is affirmed would have been at the
disposal of Lord Fitzwilliam's Board, under Mr.
Fox's Bill. This Patronage, whatever it is, is
always magnified, and never explained. As far as
it means the nomination of Clerks, and other of∣ficers
at the India House, it is not an object very
much worth dispute: but as far as it relates to
contracts, and money laid out in shipping and trade
at home, it should not be forgotten, that the ma∣nagement
of these matters was not placed in Lord
Fitzwilliam's Board, by Mr. Fox's Bill, but in a
Board of <HI>Assistant Directors,</HI> appointed by Parlia∣ment
from among the then existing Directors or
Proprietors of India Stock, for that special pur∣pose.
These Assistant Directors, however, being
bound to obey the orders of the Superior Board,
Lord Fitzwilliam <HI>might</HI> have commanded their
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
Patronage, and perverted their commercial deal∣ings
to his own political purposes—granted—there
was certainly no security against so flagrant an
abuse of trust, but in the character of the person
trusted; and what reason is there to think that the
present Board of Controul have no weight of in∣fluence
with respect to this very Patronage, if they
chose to act as they suppose Lord Fitzwilliam would
have done? Or, who is there that does not see that
the Court of Directors are becoming every day
mere instruments in the hands of this Board, and
that there can be nothing of exclusive Patronage
belonging to them, more than would have belong∣ed
to the Assistant Directors under Mr. Fox's Bill?
In plain sense, the whole and only difference, in
point of Patronage, between the two Boards, is,
that by Mr. Fox's Bill it was given <HI>directly,</HI> and
must have been exercised <HI>openly</HI>; by Mr. Pitt's
Bill it is given <HI>circuitously,</HI> and may be exercised
<HI>secretly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>(C)</HEAD>
<P>" <HI>Appeal to the King.</HI>—"] The application to the
<HI>King in Council,</HI> which Mr. Pitt's Bill declares it
shall be <HI>lawful</HI> for the Court of Directors to make,
whenever they conceive the orders of the Board
not to <HI>relate</HI> to <HI>points connected</HI> with the Civil or
Military Government and Revenues in India, is a
strange mockery, when gravely held out to the
Company as a security against encroachment or
interference in Commercial matters, on the part
of the Board of Controul. It proves, however,
how perfectly distinct, in theory at least, the fra∣mers
of this Bill considered the Board of Controul,
from the general executive government of the
country:—the limits of the authority of the Di∣rectors
are circumscribed within certain bounds,
and if they transgress them, or refuse obedience
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
where the law has commanded them to pay it, re∣dress
is provided in the common course of law.
The law also prescribes limits to the authority and
controul of the Commissioners; but it provides no
redress should they transgress them. The most
flagrant abuse of their trust under their own Bill,
would be in any instance to assume the management
of the Company's Commerce; yet if they can
craftily effect this, they may do it with impunity;
and whenever they are opposed, if they can pro∣cure
the sanction of the Council on their side, that
is, fairly speaking, of themselves in a different
character—they have the law on their side also!</P>
<P>But there is nothing more curious than to observe
the preposterous and degrading office which these
zealous advocates for the dignity and prerogatives
of the Crown, have provided for the Monarch, were
ever such an appeal to be made.—His Majesty, in
Council, shall decide, <Q REND="inline">whether the dispatch, or
order, referred to his Royal judgment, be, or be
not, connected with the <HI>Civil</HI> or <HI>Military</HI> Go∣vernment
and <HI>Revenues</HI> of the territories and
possessions in India;</Q> and this decision is to be
made upon such statements and information as the
parties shall condescend to favour him with, upon
subjects wholly removed from the ordinary con∣templation
of his Majesty's Government. Mr.
Dundas asserts, that the measure proposed belongs
to <HI>his department exclusively</HI>—being a measure relat∣ing
to <HI>war,</HI> or <HI>peace,</HI> or <HI>negociation</HI> or <HI>revenue</HI>; and
that therefore his <HI>will</HI> and <HI>pleasure</HI> ought to have
been implicitly obeyed. The Directors humbly
contend, without presuming to question the <HI>sove∣reignity</HI>
of the Board of Controul, that the mea∣sure
is of a <HI>Commercial</HI> nature merely.—His Majesty
sits the unprincely umpire between his contending
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
subjects, deciding upon the extent of Imperial
prerogatives, in the exercise of which he has nei∣ther
will nor voice.</P>
<P>But, if any thing further were wanting to shew
the falacy of this pretended security to the rights
of the Company, we find it amply made out in the
notable device of compelling the <HI>Directors to establish</HI>
a <HI>Secret Committee,</HI> to be <HI>solely under the orders of
the Board of Controul.</HI> The Secret Committee was
accordingly soon employed contrary to the professed
purpose of its institution; and it was as soon pre∣dicted,
that the whole affair of an appeal to the
King in Council, might at once be evaded by the
Board of Controul directing, through their Secret
Agents, as matter <HI>connected</HI> with <HI>revenue</HI> or <HI>negotia∣tion,</HI>
whatever <HI>commercial</HI> arrangement they pleased.—But it occurred to no man, that the Board would
be so unwary, at least till the system should be
more fully established, as to endeavour to adopt a
precedent for a right of <HI>direct controul</HI> and <HI>manage∣ment</HI>
over <HI>commercial</HI> matters, without cover or pre∣tence,
by means of or in collusion with, the Secret
Committee: yet has this already been the case.
The Secret Committee, (to whom, however, no
<HI>intentional</HI> ill-conduct is meant to be imputed,) on
the first of June 1786, assume, in concert with the
Board of Controul, powers from which both by
law and the nature of their trust, they were equally
excluded. They take upon themselves to direct a
<HI>purchase of cotton</HI> to be made at Bombay, for expor∣tation
to China, and order five ships to receive the
cargo; and direct the remittance of a considerable
sum from home, to answer the expence, all with∣out
the authority or knowledge of the Directors.
The Board of Controul approve the measure, and
the dispatch, in the following terms, unguardedly
called in the House of Commons,—"<HI>blindly lending
their name in the usual form.</HI>"</P>

proposed to be brought home from India, to which

<P><HI>Expostulation and Remonstrances of the Directors.</HI>]
The differences which have subsisted between the
Court of Directors and the Board of Controul, have
not been upon <HI>measures,</HI> or upon <HI>matters of opinion,</HI>
or upon trivial points; but all of them upon ques∣tions
of <HI>right,</HI> of <HI>law,</HI> and upon the <HI>nature</HI> and
<HI>limits</HI> of their respective <HI>powers.</HI> Such differences,
however, will probably no more be heard of.—The last ineffectual struggle of the Company ap∣pears
to have been made. In one dispute they
tried in vain to obtain the Minister's countenance
to apply to the Representatives of the People to
arbitrate between them and the Board of Controul.
In another, they requested to be permitted to ap∣ply
to the King;—this was also refused. In the
last, they looked for redress in an appeal to the
Courts of Justice; in this they were frustrated by
the Legislature being induced to think it proper to
decide the point, and <HI>declare</HI> the law against them.
Thus circumstanced, shut out from Law, Parlia∣ment,
and the Throne, it is but reasonable to be∣lieve
that the Court of Directors will no more
be heard of, but as an instrument to serve the
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
ambition, or to skreen the misconduct of their
masters.</P>

<HEAD>(E) FOURTH ESTATE.</HEAD>
<P>" <HI>New Estate or Department</HI>—"] The purposes
and characters of men have been often misrepre∣sented
and misunderstood through the efforts and
prejudices of party; but it is a most singular cir∣cumstance
that nearly a whole nation should have
been persuaded to understand a Bill passed in the
House of Commons, and given to the public in
print, in a manner directly contrary to its plain
meaning and express provisions; and that even
sober and rational men should have joined in the
outcry against it, without giving themselves the
trouble to examine whether it really was the mea∣sure
which it was represented to be.</P>
<P>Whatever other faults were found with Mr.
Fox's Bill, nothing certainly operated more in
the clamour that was raised against it, than a con∣fused
notion that it some way or other attacked the
prerogatives of the Crown, and aimed to take from
the King certain powers and authorities which of
right belonged to him. This idea, whether urged
by the mob as <Q REND="inline"><HI>an attempt to take the Crown from
the King's head,</HI></Q> or, in the politer jargon, of a
<Q REND="inline"><HI>fourth estate,</HI></Q> and <Q REND="inline"><HI>imperium in imperio,</HI></Q> was
certainly a main ingredient in the delusion which
pervaded the country at the last general election.
Yet is it utterly impossible for any man of common
sense to read the Bill <HI>attentively,</HI> without being
puzzled to guess at the ground upon which such a
deception could so long have been maintained.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox's Bill enacted in fact nothing new of any
sort with respect to the Royal Authority; nor did it
contain any one thing in derogation of any one pre∣rogative
of the Crown. If the existence of <HI>Direc∣tors
for the management of the affairs of the East India</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
<HI>Company</HI> constituted a <HI>fourth Estate,</HI> that fourth
estate existed before; and this very phrase is to be
found in pamphlets written against this very Com∣pany
twenty years since. If a <HI>parliamentary</HI> no∣mination
of persons to be concerned in the govern∣ment
of India, was an <HI>attack upon the constitution,</HI> the
constitution had sustained and survived a similar
attack in the Regulating Act of 1773, and in the
subsequent Bills which repeated those <HI>Parliamentary</HI>
appointments. If the employing the Patronage of
the Company, without the King's authority, was
an <HI>invasion of his prerogative,</HI> it was of a prerogative
never heard of, for the Crown had never had the
grant of a single office, civil or military, belonging
to the service of the East India Company. In fact
so far as the Crown was concerned at all, it acquir∣ed,
in the right of nominating to the vacant offices
in the new commission, a power the King had ne∣ver
possessed before. Whether the <HI>new</HI> Directors
for the affairs of India were likely to make a <HI>better
government</HI> than the <HI>old,</HI> is not the question; the
extraordinary circumstance is, that this Bill, which
left the Crown <HI>in the full possession of its prerogatives</HI>
of <HI>war, peace,</HI> and <HI>negotiation</HI> in India, should have
been represented as <HI>depriving it of its just rights,</HI> and
raising a <HI>Parliamentary commussion above its authority</HI>;
and that Mr. Pitt's Bill, which <HI>actually strips the
Throne</HI> of those main ensigns of <HI>Imperial authority</HI>;
should have been universally admitted at least to
have the merit of a <HI>due deference to the rights and
person of the Sovereign!</HI></P>
<P>However, when people are pressed to explain
what their meaning is—they are compelled to own,
that when they speak of a <HI>fourth estate,</HI> and an <HI>over∣throwing
of the constitution,</HI> and an <HI>attack upon the pre∣rogative,</HI>
they do not mean that all this was done,
or attempted by the Bill, but—that these things
<HI>might</HI> have come to pass in consequence of it;—<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
because, say they, a great political party having
got possession of the <HI>Patronage</HI> of India for four
years, they would instantly have become so strong,
that the King could not easily have dismissed them;
and so the <HI>prerogative would have been invaded.</HI> This
party would also in time, by means of this Patro∣nage,
have been able to obtain a predominant par∣ty
in Parliament; and so the <HI>constitution would have
been destroyed.</HI> Now, to make any sense of the first
objection, it is necessary to assert, as all violent
people did, that, although the King she should have
thought proper to have dismissed the <HI>Duke of Port∣land's
Administration,</HI> and had been equally desirous
of changing the <HI>Indian Administration,</HI> yet that Lord
Fitzwilliam, and his Board, could have held com∣plete
and independent possession of the Government
of India for four years, in spight of his Royal
wishes, and have applied all the Patronage and in∣fluence
of their situation to the support of the ex∣ministers.
This is literally what every man meant
who meant any thing, or who had any sincere alarm
on the subject. That the mere vulgar, or very
ignorant people, should have adopted this notion,
is not very strange, considering the pains which
were taken to circulate it; but that a person of
LORD CAMDEN'S character, accustomed to consider
laws with temper and deliberation, should now
again have gravely detailed all this sort of argument
in the House of Lords, have warned them against this
<HI>fourth estate,</HI> this <HI>imperium in imperio</HI> asserting, as is
reported,<Q REND="inline">that had his Majesty thought proper, by
virtue of his undoubted prerogative, to have dis∣missed
Mr. Fox and his party from his service, we
might have seen the <HI>King of Great Britain,</HI> and the
<HI>King of Bengal,</HI> contending in Parliament for supe∣riority,</Q>
is a matter altogether surprising!—It
is surprising, because the whole of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if se∣riously
urged, must arise from a perfect misappre∣hension
of the Bill, and be founded upon the false
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
and perverse notion before stated, that the Board
appointed by it, was placed out of the reach, and
above the controul, of the King's Ministers for the
time being. Two gentlemen of the House of
Commons, of great ability and character, Mr.
SCOTT and Mr. HARDING—confessed very can∣didly
that they had been in a mistake with respect
to this part of the Bill; they still, however, per∣sisted
to argue upon conclusions founded upon ac∣knowledged
error.</P>
<P>What is the real case?—Mr. Fox's Bill enacts,
<Q REND="inline">that the <HI>said Directors hereby appointed,</HI> or any
three of them, shall have, use, possess, exercise,
all and singular the powers and authorities which
have been, at any time heretofore, vested in, or
lawfully exercised by, the said Directors hereby
discontinued, or Proprietors, or by the General
Court of Proprietors of the said United Compa∣ny,
and all such farther and other powers and
authorities, and <HI>under such directions,</HI> and <HI>subject
to such limitations and restrictions as in this act,</HI> or
<HI>in</HI> ANY OTHER ACT, the provisions where of ARE
NOT HEREBY ALTERED OR REPEALED, are con∣tained
for the government and management of
the said territorial possessions, revenues, and
commerce, of the said United Company, or in
any wise relative thereto. And further, that in
all cases whatsoever, where any act, matter, or
thing, is directed to be done or consented to, or
any accounts or writings to be signed by the Di∣rectors
hereby discontinued; <HI>such act, matter,
or thing,</HI> shall, from and after the commerce∣ment
of this act, be <HI>done</HI> or consented to; and
such accounts or writings shall be signed by <HI>three
of the Directors hereby appointed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, in order to understand what the real situ∣ation
of <HI>the new Directors</HI> would have been, and
what the extent of their powers, it should seem
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
that the natural thing was, to examine what <HI>were</HI>
the <HI>directions, limitations,</HI> and <HI>restrictions,</HI> not ex∣pressly
repealed, under which they were left? In
this case it would have appeared,—that Lord FITZ∣WILLIAM
and his Board were bound to communi∣cate
to his Majesty's Ministers for the time being,
<HI>an exact copy of all dispatches and letters received from
India, or proposed to be sent thither, which should</HI>—<Q REND="inline">ANY WAY RELATE to the REVENUES, or to the
CIVIL and MILITARY affairs and GOVERNMENT
of the said <HI>United Company.</HI></Q>—That Lord FITZ∣WILLIAM
and his Board were bound <Q REND="inline"><HI>to pay</HI> DUE
OBEDIENCE <HI>to, and to be</HI> GOVERNED <HI>and</HI> BOUND
<HI>by, such</HI> INSTRUCTIONS <HI>as they should receive</HI>
FROM HIS MAJESTY, <HI>by one of his Majesty's prin∣cipal
Secretaries of State,</HI> IN ALL THEIR CON∣DUCT,
<HI>and</HI> TRANSACTIONS, <HI>(and in those of their
Governors, Presidents, and Councils respectively,)
with the</HI> COUNTRY POWERS <HI>in the East Indies,
and also in regard to the</HI> LEVYING WAR <HI>and</HI> MAK∣ING
PEACE.</Q>—That Lord FITZWILLIAM and
his Board had no means of using the credit of the
East India Company for the relief of the Compa∣ny's
pressing distresses, <Q REND="inline"><HI>without the</HI> CONSENT <HI>and</HI>
ORDER <HI>first had and obtained of the Commissioners
of his Majesty's Treasury for the time being.</HI></Q>—That Lord FITZWILLIAM and his Board, in mak∣ing
provision for the defence of the possessions in
the East Indies, were bound to act <Q REND="inline"><HI>on the requi∣sition,
and under the inspection of the Commissioners
of his Majesty's Navy, and Office of Ordnance.</HI></Q>—Upon the whole, it would have appeared that their
Board was placed, in every important matter, un∣der
so strong a controul of the <HI>Ministers for the
time being,</HI> and so wholly without the power of
acting upon their own judgment or discretion, in
all the more important objects of their institution,
that no set of men, who were not content from
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
the meanest motives, to hold the <HI>appearance</HI> of
power upon the most abject conditions, could have
remained in their Offices a week, with an Admini∣stration
desirous to get rid of them. Let these
plain facts be once understood, let the state of sub∣ordination
of the new Directors to the King's Go∣vernment
be fairly examined, and it will be appa∣rent
at once,—that without having recourse to a
Parliamentary address,—the Duke of Portland's
Administration once dismissed, the resignation of
Lord Fitzwilliam's Board must have followed in∣stantly;
that is, if it was the object of the advisers
of the Crown to change the Indian Government;—if <HI>otherwise,</HI> undoubtedly Lord Fitzwilliam and
his associates were at liberty to continue in a labo∣rious
duty, without pay or emolument, and inca∣pacitated
from accepting any place of profit from
the Crown, and to sacrifice their ease and their
time under Ministers with whom they had no bond
of union, nor habits of regard, from a desire to do
good, and to effect the great puposes of their ap∣pointment—the reform of the abuses in India,
and the re-establishment of the British character.
To execute this trust faithfully, a rigid scrutiny
into past misconduct, a severe oeconomy in future
arrangements, a just, disinterested, and impartial
management of Patronage, would have been among
the first duties expected from them. While they
<HI>so</HI> acted, if it was the King's pleasure, his Mini∣sters,
whoever they were, might certainly have <HI>ab∣stained</HI>
from the exercise of the decisive controul
they possessed over them; but then, wherein would
have consisted the attack on the prerogative, or
the danger of the Constitution? But supposing a
different conduct to have been pursued by the
Board;—that forgetting what they owed to their
own characters, as well as to the duties of their sta∣tion,
they had perverted the powers of their trust,
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
and had endeavoured to employ them solely to
answer party purposes at home;—the remedy
was at hand, and the first application of it must
have been effectual.</P>
<P>This being the fact, an objection of a different
nature may, no doubt, be instantly made, namely,
that as the King was to nominate to <HI>vacancies upon
resignation,</HI> the Bill might have been used not to
<HI>destroy,</HI> but to <HI>increase</HI> the power of the Crown;—the truth is, that it were much to be wished
that this objection could be as easily answered as
the other. MR. GRENVILLE was the only person
connected with the present Administration, who
argued the Bill upon this ground, at the time of its
passing through the House of Commons. The fair
answer, however, is, that there was every security
taken against this worst of mischiefs, which the
nature of the measure itself, and the urgent neces∣sity
which called for it, admitted of. The public
had a pledge in the characters of the persons who
framed that Bill, in the whole tenor of their poli∣tical
life, and in their recent and honest exertions
to reduce the influence of the Crown, that it was
not <HI>their</HI> intention at least, to deceive or delude
them upon this subject.—If these Ministers were
displaced, there was the same security in the cha∣racter
of the Indian Board, and in the very prin∣ciple
upon which it had been formed. If <HI>they</HI>
too were obliged to abandon their situation, these
securities certainly vanished; and the Crown might,
<HI>for whatever term remained of the four years,</HI> have
placed the powers given to the Parliamentary trus∣tees,
in the hands of its own creatures. But this
could not have been done <HI>secretly</HI> or <HI>silently</HI>—not
without serious discussion—not without the at∣tention
of the Public being immediately and for∣cibly
drawn to the subject and to the characters
and principles of the new Board; no new ar∣rangement
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
could pretend to claim the confidence
of a Parliamentary nomination; Parliament must
therefore have had the matter before them in a
new point of view and have become accessory to
the surrender, if they were to be surrendered, of
those powers and that patronage to the Crown,—which all parties professed so much to dread to see
lodged there.—Against such a conduct in Par∣liament
there is certainly no remedy, nor ever
will be.</P>
<P>The only thing like an objection on this head re∣maining,
is, that upon a supposition that his Ma∣jesty
had been pleased to continue the Duke of
Portland's Administration for the term of four years,
for which the India Board was appointed, the sup∣posed
good understanding between the Ministers
and the new India Government, would have given
them an opportunity of using the Company's influ∣ence
and Patronage, to make friends, and to create
an interest which might have been of use to them
at the end of that term. This undoubtedly <HI>might</HI>
have been the case, but not without an abuse of
their trust; and against this the public had certainly
no security but in the character of the Board. In
a comparison, however, of the two Bills, it is ob∣vious
to ask,—what security have the public against
the same thing now? The means of Patronage
and influence to all important purposes were before
proved to be equal; and if Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dun∣das
have for their object the attaching a <HI>powerful
Indian interest,</HI> both at home and abroad, to <HI>them∣selves,</HI>
who that observes and understands the mea∣sures
daily pursued, both with regard to the <HI>Direc∣tors,</HI>
the <HI>Proprietors,</HI> the <HI>Army,</HI> and the <HI>Governments</HI>
and <HI>Councils</HI> abroad, can be so duped as not to own,
that a very few years more must make <HI>them</HI> as for∣midable
as Indian influence and attachment, so
concentred and headed, can make any party.</P>

<HEAD>(I) SECRET COMMITTEE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Secret Committee, created by Mr. Pitt's
Bill in the Court of Directors, is an instrument of
government unlike any thing existing in any other
country, or any thing to be found in the history of
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
all past governments. A body of men in authority
(the Court of Directors) acting under a delegated
trust from their constituents, the East India Com∣pany)
take an oath on their election to support the
interests and rights of the Company.—These Di∣rectors
are then bound by law to choose a Secret
Committee from among themselves, which Secret
Committee are to take an oath to be true to the
trust reposed in them by the Directors; but to obey
only such orders and directions as they shall receive
from the Board of Controul, which orders and di∣rections
they swear also never to communicate to
the Directors, who appoint them, without the con∣sent
of the said Board of Controul.—This Secret
Committee have no power of originating or direc∣ing
any thing to be done of their own authority,
still less, by suggestion or instruction from the Di∣rectors;
all the Governments and Presidencies,
however, in India, are bound to pay a faithful obe∣dience
to their orders and dispatches, and to answer
the same upon the same terms of secrecy, <Q REND="inline">as if
such Orders and Directions had been issued and
transmitted by the Court of Directors of the
said United Company.</Q></P>
<P>If it were worth reasoning or arguing upon, it
would be no difficult matter to prove that this
crooked system of involved mystery and contradic∣tory
duties, could never have been meant for any
fair purpose of good government. Facts, however,
make reasoning on the subject unnecessary. The
institution had scarcely taken place, with the addi∣tion
of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> added in the Explanatory Act
passed in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, before this Committee, appointed
for the purpose of issuing the secret instructions of
the Board of Controul, relating to matters of <HI>war</HI>
and <HI>peace,</HI> are directed to manage, as a <HI>matter of se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ecy,</HI>
the <HI>settlement of an old debt</HI> due from the Nabob of Arcot to the Company.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="42"/>
Nothing could be more clearly out of the spirit
and meaning of the Act of 1784, than this mea∣sure.
The Board of Controul had already assumed
an arbitrary power of settling the debts due from
the Nabob to <HI>individuals,</HI> as <HI>matter connected with
revenue.</HI> The Directors conceived they might at
least have been permitted to settle <HI>their own</HI> debt,
which was their property, and stated as part of
their effects to Parliament; but this was discovered
to be—<HI>matter connected with negociation.</HI> The Board
of Controul had no power to issue their orders,
through the <HI>Secret Committee,</HI> with respect to mat∣ters
of <HI>revenue</HI>; but with respect to <HI>treaties</HI> with
<HI>native Princes,</HI> they had: accordingly the settling
a sufficient security for an old and public debt to
the Company, due from a dependent on their Go∣vernment,
was converted into <HI>a negociation of state,</HI>
deemed a matter of secresy, and withdrawn even
from the knowledge of those who alone had any
title to the debt. The Directors apply to their
Counsel; and they are truly informed by Mr. Rous,
that <Q REND="inline">the whole effect of the last Regulating Bill,
in constituting the two Boards of Directors and
of Commissioners, the one proposing measures,
and the other, after representation, finally de∣ciding,
will be lost, as far as concerns the Go∣vernment
of Madras, <HI>if the intercourse with the
Nabob shall be confined to the Secret Department</HI>;
because this intercourse involves directly, the
arrangements respecting the military force, and
indirectly, <HI>every interest of that settlement.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The dispute comes before the Court of Proprie∣tors,
who resolve, on the 30th of June 1786,—<Q REND="inline">that the construction of the Act of the 24th of
his present Majesty, under which the Right
Honourable Board of Commissioners for the Af∣fairs
of India have claimed to exercise the pow∣ers
in instances before the Court, is <HI>subversive</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>
<HI>of the authority of the Court of Directors,</HI> and the
<HI>Chartered Rights</HI> of the Company, recognized and
confirmed by the said Act; and tends to establish
a <HI>Secret System of Government, highly dangerous
to the interests of the Public and the Company.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It was farther <HI>resolved unanimously,</HI> <Q REND="inline">that this
General Court do return thanks to the Court of
Directors for the <HI>firmness</HI> with which they have
<HI>maintained the rights of the Company,</HI> against the
<HI>claims of the Right Honourable Board of Commi∣sioners
for the Affairs of India</HI>; and that the spi∣rited
Protest of Mr. Samuel Smith, merits the
approbation of his constituents.</Q></P>
<P>Upon this the Court of Directors resolve, that
<Q REND="inline">it is expedient to apply to the Legislature for a
further explanation, and more correct limita∣tion
of the powers of the Board of Controul.</Q>
At the same time, however, with a very natural
caution, they think it prudent to ask <HI>Mr. Pitt's
permission</HI> to do so first. Accordingly the Chair∣man,
and Deputy Chairman, are directed to wait
on the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and propose
the following question: <Q REND="inline">If the Court of Direc∣tors,
with the authority of the General Court
of Proprietors, <HI>shall think proper to apply to Par∣liament
to</HI> explain the powers of the Board of
Controul, with regard to the secret correspon∣dence
relative to the country powers of India,
will <HI>you</HI> assist them in their application?</Q></P>
<P>Here seems to have been a reasonable case made
for a <HI>Declaratory Law,</HI> if (according to <HI>Mr. Scott,</HI>)
<Q REND="inline">a material difference of opinion between the
Company and the Board of Controul is a suffici∣ent
ground for one.</Q></P>
<P>The Chancellor of the Exchequer however, af∣ter
due deliberation, answers, that <Q REND="inline">he cannot
agree in the sentiments expressed in the Resolu∣tion
concerning the conduct of the <HI>Right Ho∣nourable</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
<HI>Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of
India, and does not see any ground for an applica∣tion
to Parliament on the subject.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In a Court of Proprietors, these proceedings be∣ing
reported, it was moved, <Q REND="inline">that a Committee
be appointed to take into consideration the state
of this Company, under the operation and ef∣fect
of the last act of the 24th and 26th of
George III.</Q> Upon this a ballot was demanded,
in which (the refractory conduct of the Court of
Directors and Proprietors having created a consi∣derable
alarm) a proper <HI>weight of influence</HI> was ex∣erted,
and the question passed in <HI>the negative.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Samuel Smith's testimony on this occasion,
as he has been a zealous friend to the present Ad∣ministration
in Parliament, must be admitted to be
at least free from party prejudice. He says, in
the Protest above alluded to, containing the rea∣sons
of his resignation, </P>
<LETTER REND="inline" LANG="eng">
<P>It will be in vain to con∣tend
that the <HI>Patronage</HI> is secured to the <HI>Com∣pany</HI>

is secret,</HI> it will be absurd to suppose that
the <HI>Patronage will be open</HI>; or that those <HI>who
have no voice in the measure</HI> will have much
concern, <HI>if any, in the appointments</HI>; if they have

and controuling the Affairs of India,</HI> it will,

<P>A public situation, reduced to the mere <HI>me∣chanism

<P><HI>Agree upon its Meaning.</HI>] THE Declaratory Law
was defended by many, upon the ground of its
declaring no more power to be in the Board of
Controul than it was fit and reasonable to give them;
and that to suppose that the Original Act had given
them less, was to admit that Parliament had enacted
an absurd and inconsistent law. This argument,
altho' a popular one, and sanctioned—altho' a popu∣lar
one—by LORD HAWKESBURY, is an intolerably
bad argument when applied to Parliament, acting
in a great measure in their judicial capacity: It is
to set up their pride against their justice; and to
pique them to commit an act of violence, rather
than confess an act of folly. Other Members,
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
however, in both Houses of Parliament professed
that <HI>they</HI> supported the Declaratory Law, as a true
construction of Mr. Pitt's Bill, from a recollection
of <HI>their own meaning</HI> at the time they voted for it.
Yet few of these Members agreed with each other,
as to the powers they conceived they <HI>had</HI> given to
the Board of Controul. LORD CAMDEN having
been out of the kingdom when the Act of 1784
passed, professed to have nothing to say to the <HI>inten∣tions</HI>
of the Legislature in passing the Act, but to
have formed <HI>his</HI> opinion upon <Q REND="inline">the plain and ob∣vious
meaning of <HI>the clauses taken collectively.</HI></Q>
The learned Lord was obliged, however, to admit,
that there were many words omitted which were
necessary to make out his instruction, and ma∣ny
others inserted which directly contradict∣ed
it; but this he presumed to have happen∣ed
through <HI>inadvertency</HI>; and therefore a whole
clause coming under the latter description—<Q REND="inline"><HI>nil operatur.</HI></Q> A new and most extraordinary
mode, the most unlearned man may venture to as∣sert,
of interpreting laws affecting the rights and
property of the subject!</P>
<P>But the pleasantest ground was taken by the
DUKE of RICHMOND. The noble Duke declared
he had voted <HI>against</HI> Mr. Pitt's Bill, because he
<HI>differed</HI> at the time from those who had introduced
it with respect to its meaning. <HI>He</HI> thinking that it
<HI>did</HI> actually give those powers to the Board of Con∣troul,
which <HI>they</HI> asserted were <HI>not</HI> meant to be gi∣ven.
It now therefore appearing that they had
come over to <HI>his</HI> opinion, <HI>consistency</HI> demanded from
him to give vigour and efficacy to a law—which
justice and policy had convinced him ought never
to have existed.</P>
<P>It would certainly be a difficult task to argue on
the <HI>intentions</HI> of different Members at the time the
Act of 1784 passed, and a very unfair way of argu∣ing
with respect to any but those who publicly gave
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
their enterpretation of the Bill, during its progress.
Mr. BASTARD'S quotations from the Minister's for∣mer
speeches seem to have been generally admit∣ted
to have contained a true exposition of the Mi∣nister's
former meaning; but there is one decisive
test easily recurred to, which was very ably argued
upon by Mr. POWIS; namely, to compare the
Bill in the state in which it was <HI>first</HI> brought into
the House by Mr. Pitt, with <HI>that</HI> to which he altered
it, after a discussion with the Directors, in the
Committee. Here it will decisively appear that
many of these very powers which are <HI>now</HI> contend∣ed
to be given to the Board of Controul, by <HI>con∣struction</HI>
and <HI>implication,</HI> were <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>plainly</HI>
given in the Bill as <HI>it stood on its first reading,</HI> and
were afterwards withdrawn or modified upon <HI>con∣ference</HI>
and <HI>explanation</HI> with these who objected to
them, as intrenching on right which they had not
consented to yield.—This evidence is conclusive.</P>
<P>" <HI>Explain the original Act</HI>—"] THERE is no
instance, perhaps, wherein the extraordinary spirit
in which Mr. Pitt's Bill is worded, appears more
plainly than in its bold and irregular manner of re∣pealing
matters supposed to be inconsistent with the
new enactments.</P>
<P>In all the former Acts we find a regard to perspi∣cuity
and fair dealing, expressed as in the Act of
21st of the present King. <Q REND="inline">And be it further en∣acted
by the authority aforesaid, that <HI>all and every
the rights,</HI> interests, powers, privileges, and au∣thorities,
which are now vested in the said Uni∣ted

to the East Indies, and <HI>which are</HI> NOT <HI>hereby</HI> EX∣PRESSLY
TAKEN AWAY, altered, or varied, shall
remain to, and continue in the said Company,
in as full and ample a manner, to all intents and
purposes whatsoever, as if this Act had never
been made.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="48"/>
This is the language of laws that mean to be
intelligible, and to do justice,</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt's Bill settles the point in a different man∣ner:—<Q REND="inline">And be it further enacted, that all such
powers and authorities given to, or vested in the
Proprietors and Directors of the said United Com∣pany,
or in any General or Special Court there∣of
respectively, in, and by any Act of Parlia∣ment
or Charter, as are <HI>contrary</HI> or REPUGNANT
to THIS ACT, or ANY THING HEREIN CON∣TAINED,
shall be, and the same are hereby
REPEALED; any thing contained in any Act or
Charter, or any custom or usage to the contrary
notwithstanding.</Q> Whether under this loose
and arrogant mandate, so unlike the temperate pre∣cision
of a British law upon such a subject, there is
any one <HI>right, power,</HI> or <HI>property</HI> of any sort, left
to the Company, may reasonably be doubted;
indeed since the construction given to "THIS ACT,"
by the Declaratory Law, it is difficult to imagine
any power ever exercised by them, which might
not be proved in a court of justice to be <HI>repugnant
to something</HI> contained in Mr. Pitt's Bill.</P>

<P>" <HI>Mr. Pitt's Bill a perpetual law</HI>—] IT was pro∣posed,
both in the House of Lords and in the House
of Commons, to limit the duration of the powers
of the Board of Controul to the term for which
the Company held their charter of exclusive trade.
It is scarcely to be conceived, that if this question
were to be fairly argued upon its own ground, when
Ministers should be graciously disposed to allow a
little time for its discussion, that either Mr. PITT
or Lord HAWKESBURY could easily prevail on
either House of Parliament to reject it; because
such a conduct would be, in fact, to induce the le∣gislature
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
deliberately to violate a solemn compact
made between Parliament and a body of merchants,
not with respect to their charter of <HI>power</HI> and <HI>mono∣poly,</HI>
which being a trust, as all power is, might
be resumed upon abuse; but with respect to <HI>estates,</HI>
<HI>rights</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> which no mismanagement could
forfeit, and for which a valuable consideration had
been paid to the public.</P>
<P>By the Act of the 21st of his present Majesty,
the Company's charter of exclusive trade will ex∣pire
in 1794, upon previous notice from Parliament.—The 4th and 6th clauses of this Act repeat the
reservation in favour of the rights and privileges of
the Company, independently of their right to the
exclusive trade, and stating the consideration paid
<Q REND="inline">for the service of the Crown of England, <HI>entitling
them to these advantages,</HI></Q> conclude in these words:—<Q REND="inline">Provided always, and it is hereby further en∣acted,
that nothing in the above proviso, or in
any proviso in the said Act of the ninth year of
the reign of his said late Majesty King William
the Third, or in the said charter of the fifth day
of September, in the tenth year of his said late
Majesty's reign, or in any other act or charter
contained, shall extend, or be construed to ex∣tend,
to <HI>determine the Corporation</HI> of the said
United Company of Merchants of England
trading to the East Indies; or to <HI>hinder, prevent,</HI>
or <HI>exclude</HI> the said United Company from carry∣ing
on AT ALL TIMES <HI>after such determination of
the right to the sole, whole, and exclusive trade,</HI> as
aforesaid, a FREE TRADE in, to, and from the
East Indies, and parts aforesaid, with all, or any
part of their <HI>own joint stock</HI> in trade, goods
merchandizes, estate, and effects, IN COMMON
with OTHER THE SUBJECTS OF HIS MAJESTY,
his heirs and successors, trading, in, to, or from
those parts.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="50"/>
After this, to enact a law to place them in their
corporate capacity as merchants united to trade
<Q REND="inline">upon their own joint stock and estate,</Q> (without
any exclusive right or protection from Government
whatever,) under the <HI>perpetual controul</HI> of certain
Commissioners <HI>named by the Crown,</HI> to whom they
are bound <Q REND="inline"><HI>to communicate all their transactions,</HI></Q>
and without whose signature they can issue no one
commercial order, is surely a most flagrant and
wanton violation of private property, as well as
public faith, and indeed of every right that law or
charter can be supposed to secure to any one.</P>
<P>With respect to the Company's <HI>claim</HI> on the <HI>terri∣torial
revenues,</HI> the breach of faith is the same.—The Company paid the public a certain sum upon
the last settlement on this subject, and it was en∣acted,
<Q REND="inline">that all the territorial acquisitions and re∣venues
lately obtained in the East Indies shall
remain in the possession of the United Company
of Merchants of England trading to the East In∣dies,
for, and during the term of the exclusive
trade granted to the said United Company.</Q> It
was stipulated, however, that beside the sum paid
a further proportion of the surplus profits of these
revenues should be <Q REND="inline">set apart, and applied for <HI>the
use of the public,</HI></Q> with this reserve, <Q REND="inline">so long as
the Company shall be entitled to the <HI>sole</HI> and <HI>ex∣clusive</HI>
trade.</Q>—21st George III.</P>
<P>Upon these terms the <HI>question of right</HI> between
the <HI>public</HI> and the <HI>Company</HI> was <HI>suspended</HI> until the
expiration of the charter of monopoly. And the
saving clause which had been inserted in all former
Acts relating to this point was repeated. Clause
83. <Q REND="inline">Provided always, and be it enacted, that no∣thing
herein contained shall extend, or be con∣strued
to extend, to prejudice or affect the rights,
or the claims of the public, or <HI>the said United
Company,</HI> respecting the said territorial acquisi∣tions
and <HI>revenues.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51"/>
The right of the Company under this compact
is—not to <HI>the property</HI> of the revenues certainly,
but to a <HI>decision</HI> upon the subject on the expiration
of their charter of exclusive trade, or to be placed
in the same situation with <HI>respect to their claim</HI> in
which they stood when they made their bargain.
In lieu of this, a <HI>new Claimant</HI> is created by Par∣liament,
being <HI>neither the public</HI> nor the <HI>Company,</HI>
to whom the law gives the <HI>perpetual disposal</HI> of these
revenues so claimed by the public on one part, and
the Company on the other. For it is to be remem∣bered,
(granting the Board of Controul to be act∣ing
for the Crown) that the King is <HI>not</HI> the re∣presentative
of the <HI>Public,</HI> with respect to their
<HI>property</HI> and <HI>purse</HI>; but that on the contrary the
Constitution regards with jealousy, and places
no trust in the Crown upon that head; so that
the <HI>Public</HI> would be defrauded, although the re∣venues
were to come under the disposal of the
<HI>King.</HI> But even that is not the case; for the
Board of Controul can appropriate them <HI>without
the direction of the Crown,</HI> as well as without the di∣rection
of the Company, or of Parliament. Par∣liament
therefore breaks its faith to the Company,
without doing justice to the Public; and the title
and claims of both are extinguished, not in favour
of the Crown, but in favour of a FOURTH ESTATE,
which acquires the strange and anomalous right ei∣ther
of disposing of the PROPERTY OF INDIVIDU∣ALS,
against their consent, or of applying the PRO∣PERTY
OF THE STATE without the sanction of Par∣liament.</P>
