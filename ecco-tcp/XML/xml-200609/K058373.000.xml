<HEAD>THE
<HI REND="blackletterType">Free-Holders Plea</HI>
AGAINST
STOCK-JOBBING
Elections of PARLIAMENT Men.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Nations in the World, we
may say, without Detracting from the
Character of our Native Country, that
<HI>England</HI> has, for some Ages past, been the most
Distracted with Divisions and Parties among
themselves.</P>
<P>Union, and Charity, the one relating to our
Civil, the other to Religious Concerns,
are Stangers in the Land; and whether we
speak of difference in Opinions, or differences
in Interest, we must own that we are the most
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Divided, Quarrelsome Nation under the Sun.</P>
<P><HI>Poland</HI> is the only Nation of <HI>Europe</HI> which
can pretend to Match us in this Ill-natur'd Qua∣lity,
and yet all things examin'd <HI>Poland</HI> cannot
come near us.</P>
<P>'Twas a true Character given of us, by the
Wisest Princess that ever Govern'd us, Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
that the <HI>English</HI> were harder to be Go∣vern'd
in time of Peace than War.</P>
<P>What Experience our present Governors have
had of this Old Maxim in the short Peace we
have had, we leave to every Man's Observa∣tion.</P>
<P>Not
to enter into the History of the Divisions,
and Civil Disturbances in the Nations Peace,
which is too fresh in our Memories; and cannot
be review'd without sensible Regret by any
Man, who Loves his Country, or has the least
regard to its Prosperity or Reputation.</P>
<P>Yet we cannot but express our sense of the
Encrease, and more than ordinary progress of
this wrangling Temper, on the present Affairs
of the Publick; and with what Fatal success it
Invades us in the most Minute, and most tender
Parts; with what subtilty it spreads its contagi∣ous
Qualities into the Vitals of the State, and
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
from thence descends into the less Noble Parts,
the Trade of the Nation.</P>
<P>Religion and the State have felt the plague of
Contention, eating out the very Entrails of the
Nation, and with a sort of alternate Motion,
have equally come under its Malignant Effects,
for almost Four entire Centuries of Years, and
as if it was not enough to hurt us in those two
Essentials of our Peace, behold the Plague is
broke out in our Trade, which is the third, and
next the other two, the Supreme Article of the
Kingdoms Prosperity.</P>
<P>Wherefore we the Yeomandry, and poor Free-holders
of <HI>England,</HI> having, God knows, no Hand
in the Differences, tho' we have a deep share in
the Damages, do take the freedom to make our
just Remarks upon the Causes, which, as we ap∣prehend,
have conduc'd too much to the pre∣sent
unhappy Divisions of the Nation; and
which, if some care be not taken to prevent it,
may compleat the Ruin of us all.</P>
<P>The Wisdom of late Parliaments have Esta∣blish'd
two great Rivals in Trade, the Old, and
the New <HI>East India</HI> Companies.</P>
<P>We do not pretend to Arraign the Justice of
those <HI>Wonderful and Unintelligible Assemblies,</HI> if they
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
were in being, we dare not, and, since they
are not in being, 'tis not very Honourable, you'll
say, to speak ill of the Dead.</P>
<P>But thus far, we hope, without offence, we
may be allow'd to give our Opinions in this par∣ticular
Affair, that tho' separately and distinctly,
every part of the proceedings of those Parlia∣ments,
might be literally and positively Just,
and Right, we mean as to the <HI>East India</HI> Compa∣nies.</P>
<P>Yet
when they are Conjunctively, and in the
General put together, and reflected on, they
seem to be clouded both as to the publick Interest;
and as to the Honour of the proceedings, with
dark Enigma's of State, and Inexplicable Para∣doxes,
too hard for us to understand, such as
these.</P>
<P N="1">1. That during the Being of one Company,
and before the Extent of their Charter, and Pri∣vileges
were Expir'd, we mean the 3 years al∣low'd
them for bringing Home their Effects,
there should be Erected a New Company, with
power of immediate Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Had the New Company not commenc'd their Trade, till
the time of the Old was expir'd, or near it, there might
have been a Succession of Companies, not two Rival Com∣panies
in Being together.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
2. That the manner of the Trading by the New
Company should be so Order'd, as that the Old
Company by Subscribing shou'd enable them∣selves
to Trade separately, as a Company still;
and that with so Capital a Stock, as always to
share the Trade with the New Company; and so
at the same time two contraries be upheld by
the same Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Had the New Company been so Establish'd, that at the
Expiration of the Old, it shou'd have had a Commanding
Superiority, by which no other Men cou'd have Traded,
but under them, by Permission at the same time, leaving
all Men at liberty to come in and Trade with them,
there had been then no Rivals in the Trade, which will,
no question, as they now stand, soon reduce the Trade to
very low Terms.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That after this New Company was Esta∣blish'd,
and the Mony paid in, to the Use of
the Government, <HI>which some say was the thing which
first mov'd the Conception of a New Company, and which,
if the Old Company wou'd have procur'd, they had never
been Broke nor the New one Born.</HI> That after this
New Company was Erected, the Stock advanc'd,
and the Mony to the Government pay'd they
shou'd prohibit by Act of Parliament Two Thirds
of their Trade, and so Starve the Child they had
Begotten.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<HI>If the Trade was ruinous to the English Manufactures,
and the Interest of the Nation it shou'd have been foreseen,
before Gentlemen had payd their Mony, or else it shou'd
not have been Examin'd afterwards.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That after all this they shou'd grant a New
Charter to the Old Company, by Virtue of
which they have both Power and Time to Trade,
to the prejudice of the New, even to their Hearts
Content.</P>
<P>We say nothing of those particulars but thus,
that really we do not understand the consisten∣cy
of them with themselves, they stand to us as
Arcana's of Policy, too high to be medled with.</P>
<P>Nor shou'd we trouble our Heads about them,
but leave both Companies to confound one ano∣ther,
as we believe they will; but that we find so
great a part of the Nation concern'd in their
Quarrel, as gives us cause to Observe, that the Is∣sue
of them seems to threaten the Nation with
something Fatal.</P>
<P>For the Power of these two Rivals is so great,
and their Interest in the Kingdom so popular and
High, that Matters of higher Moment than
Trade seem to depend upon them, while all
the proceedings of their Members, both in the
City, and in the late Parliament, in both which
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
their Parties have been numerous, are, and have
been guided according to their Interest in their
respective Companies.</P>
<P>The Grand Work which the whole Na∣tion
is now Intent upon, is chusing their Re∣presentatives
in Parliament, Chusing Men to
Meet, and advise with the King about the most
Important Affairs of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>And while all Men ought to be fixing their
Eyes upon such Men as are best Qualified to Sit
in that Place of Honour, and to Examine who
are fittest to be Intrusted with the Religion and
Peace of <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence of
two <HI>East India</HI> Companies, as if the Interest of either
Company were to be Nam'd in the Day with the <HI>Pro∣testant
Religion and the publick Peace,</HI> or as if they, who
are fit to be Representatives of the People in the
great Matters of Peace and War, Leagues, and Alli∣ances
of Neighbours, Succession of Crowns, and
Protection of the Protestant Religion, should
not be capable of deciding the petty Contro∣versy
in Trade between two Rivial Companies.</P>
<P>The Grand Question ask'd now, when your
Vote is requir'd for a Parliament Man, is not as it
ought to be, Is he a Man of Sense, of Religion, of Ho∣nesty
and Estate?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
But, What Company is he for, the New, or
the Old?</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>A. M.</HI> set up as a Candidate in a Neigh∣bouring
Borough, Who set him up? 'Tis
known he is no Inhabitant there, nor ever was,
has no Free-hold, or Copy-hold, or Lease-hold
Estate there, nor is not known there, and of him∣self
possibly was not acquainted with 20 People
there.</P>
<P>But enquire what Company he is for; and
then see if all the rest of that Company were not
found running over the Water, to make their
Interest with their Friends for his Election.</P>
<P>And the Time would fail us, and the Paper
too, to give you a List of the Shop-keepers,
Merchants, and Pedlers, and the Stock-Jobbers,
who, with their Hir'd Liveries, in Coaches, and
Six Horses, who, God knows, never had Coach
or Livery of their own, are come down into the
Countreys, being detach'd from <HI>London,</HI> by either
Company to get themselves chosen Parliament-Men,
by those Boroughs, who are easie to be
Impos'd upon, and who, like well-meaning Men,
that know nothing of the Matter, Choose them up∣on
the Recommendation of the Pountry Gentle∣men
that have Interest in the Towns, which
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Country Gentlemen are prevail'd upon to quit
their own pretensions, to advance theirs; but
by what Arguments we cannot pretend to De∣termine.</P>
<P>We
have formerly been told that spending Mo∣ny
upon the Inhabitants of Towns, was a pernici∣ous
practice; and no doubt it was, and an Act
of Parliament has been wisely made to prevent
it.</P>
<P>What any Man cou'd propose to himself by
spending 2000 (nay, 11000 pound was spent
at the Town of <HI>Winchelsea</HI>) to be chosen to Sit
in a House, where there is not one Farthing to be
gotten honestly, was a Mystery every one did not
understand.</P>
<P>But here is a New way of getting Mony: For
if a Country Gentleman has so much Interest in
a Town, that he can be chosen a Member of
Parliament, if he will decline it, here is a sort of
Folks they call <HI>Stock-Jobbers,</HI> help him to a 1000
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s for his Interest.</P>
<P>This is Parliament-Jobbing, and a New
Trade, which as we thought it the Duty of
<HI>English</HI> Free-holders thus to Expose, we hope an
<HI>English</HI> Parliament will think it their Duty to
prevent.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
For as this Stock-Jobbing in its own Nature,
is only a new Invented sort of <HI>Deceptio Visus,</HI> a <HI>Le∣gerde-main</HI>
in Trade; so mix'd with Trick and
Cheat, that twou'd puzzle a good <HI>Logician</HI> to
make it out by <HI>Syllogism:</HI> So nothing can be more
Fatal in <HI>England</HI> to our present Constitution;
and which in time may be so to our Liberty and
Religion, than to have the Interests of Elections
Jobb'd upon Exchange for Mony, and Transfer'd
like <HI>East India</HI> Stock, to those who bid most.</P>
<P>By this Method, the Country Gentlemen may
sit at Home; and only Corresponding with the
Brokers at <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s and <HI>Garraway's,</HI> as the Prizes
Rise or Fall, they may dispose of their Interests
in the Towns they can Govern, at as good a
rate as they can.</P>
<P>The Citizens, or such who have their several
Companies and Interest to Serve, will Ease them∣selves
of the Expence of Travelling, with the
fine borrow'd Equipages before mention'd; and
only go to Market in Exchange Alley, and Buy
an Election, as the Stock-Jobber and they shall
agree, which Election shall be manag'd by the
Country Gentleman, who is to have his Bargain,
no Purchase, no Pay, and is to go thro' with it,
or else he gets none of the Mony.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Elections of Parliament-Men are in a hopeful
way; and Parliaments themselves, are in a hope∣ful
way by this concise Method of Practice, to
come unde the absolute Management of a few
Hands, and no doubt things will go on accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>Banks
and Stocks may be lay'd up, and em∣ploy'd
in a short time, for the purchasing the
Interest of Gentlemen, and our Gentry being
willing to get a Penny in <HI>an Honest way,</HI> as we say,
will but too often sell their Interests and their
Country too, especially such Gentlemen, whose
Estates are reduc'd to an occasion for it.</P>
<P>The truth of it is, 'tis a Paradox, a Riddle,
that we Country-men cannot understand, nor ne∣ver
cou'd, what makes our Gentlemen so fond
of being Parliament Men, we do not very well
understand what the Business is at the Parlia∣ment.
Only we find we are swingingly Tax'd;
and they tell us 'tis done by the Parliament; but
we never understood they had any of the Mony
themselves, we always thought the Mony was
for the King, tho' they had the Giving of it,
then we see in the King's <HI>Proclamation</HI> for Calling
a Parliament, that it was to Advise with them,
about Affairs of the Highest Importance to the
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
Kingdom. Now we cannot see they can get
any thing by coming together to be Advis'd
with, and our Knights of the Shire tell us they
get nothing by it. And here lies the Difficulty,
we can never reconcile their spending so much
Money to be Chosen, going up 200 Miles to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and spending six Months sometimes there in at∣tending
the House, and all for nothing; we have
often been thinking there must be something else
in the case, and we are afraid there is.</P>
<P>Nor did ever any thing explain this Riddle so
much, as the struggling of these two Companies
to make Members of Parliament; for the mean∣ing
to us seems thus:</P>
<P>That they suppose which Company so ever
gets most Friends in the House, will be most
likely to be farther Establish'd, to the Ruin of
the other, and therefore they make such a stir to
get Friends there.</P>
<P>Whence first it must be suppos'd that the Mat∣ter
shall not stand or fall by true Merrit, and that
Company be supprest that deserves it; for if so,
it might be probable they wou'd both be sup∣prest;
for we apprehend they are both destru∣ctive
to our <HI>English</HI> Trade in general and Manu∣factures
in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
But 2. It must be suppos'd that Friendship,
and Number of Voices only will decide the Con∣troversy.</P>
<P>And
in order to this the Stock-Jobbers, who
care not a Farthing which Side gets the better,
but makes a Prey of them both, have set up this
new Trade of Jobbing for Elections: And that
the way of their proceeding may be a little plai∣ner
understood, We desire you to read the Co∣py
of a Letter come down last Post, to a wor∣thy
Gentleman in our Country, from a Friend of
his plying in or near <HI>Exchange-Ally,</HI> concerning
this Matter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>

himself very much Oblig'd, if you wou'd Use your Interest in
his behalf, upon your Grant whereof I have an Order to Pre∣ent
you with a Thousand Guinea's to buy my Lady Pins.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
He is ready to come down at your first Summons, in a
very good Equipage; Pray dispatch your Mind per the

Sir <HI>A, B, C, D,</HI> Bar. <POSTSCRIPT>

<P>IF Sir <HI>E, F, G, H,</HI> will dispose of his Interest in the
Town of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> I can help him to very good
Terms.</P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom
this Proposal was made, rejected it with Dis∣dain,
yet the Attempt is made very plain in
the case.</P>
<P>And we are inform'd, that the Number of
Members come down into the Counties, on such
accounts, are incredible.</P>
<P>Wherefore we think it very needful to pub∣lish
our Resentments at such a practice, and to
protest against it in this our Honest Plea, as an
indirect, wicked and pernicious Practice, and
which may be of very ill consequence to the Na∣tion,
on these following Accounts,</P>
<P N="1">1. A hundred, or an hundred and fifty such
Members in the House, wou'd make a Dead
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
Weight, as it us'd to be call'd, to carry any Vote
they are For, or Against, either in the Negative
or Affirmative, as they shall agree, and if so, it
will be almost in their Power to dispose of our
Estates, Persons, Liberties and Religion, as they
think fit.</P>
<P N="2">2. If it be true, as is very rational to suppose,
that they who will Buy will Sell; or if it be true,
which seems still more rational, that they who
have Bought must Sell, must make a <HI>Penny</HI> of it,
or else they lose their <HI>Purchase,</HI> and some their
Fortunes, which they expected to raise by these
mercenary Elections; then the Influence such
a Number of Members, gotten into the House
by the method We are speaking of, will be ca∣pable
of selling our Trade, our Religion, our
Peace, our Effects, our King, our Crown, and
every thing that is Valluable, or Dear to the
Nation.</P>
<P>If Stock-jobbing of Elections be the first step,
in all probability Stock-jobbing of Votes will be
be the second; for he that will give a Thou∣sand
pounds, or more, only for a power to
Vote, expects to get something by Voting, or
gives away his Money for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17"/>
What shall we say then, if a League of Con∣federacy
shou'd be made between our Parlia∣ment-Sollicitors,
and our Stock-jobbing-brokers,
two sort of People equally mercenary and de∣ceitful.</P>
<P>We
desire to know, whether 'twould not be
more fatal to <HI>England</HI> than the Union of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> which all <HI>Europe</HI> seems to be so much
disturb'd at.</P>
<P>In vain do We the Free-Holders of <HI>England</HI>
strive to Chuse Men of all the Six Characters,
mention'd by a late Author, in order to have a
Parliament every way Quallified for the Impor∣tant
Affairs, his Majesty has mentioned in his
Proclamation.</P>
<P>In vain shall those Gentlemen We chose sit,
and Vote in the House, if such a Generation as
We hear of are let into the House, by the help
of their Money at the Boroughs and Towns, for
the Citizens and Burgesses out-run the Knigths in
Number above Three for One.</P>
<P>We think 'tis no small Misfortune to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Constitution, that so great a Number of
Members Chosen by the Corporations of <HI>England,</HI>
and, according to our weak Opinions, it seems
not equal, That all the Free-holders of a County
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
shou'd be represented only by two Men, and
the Towns in the same County be represented by
above Forty, as it is in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and near the
like in other Counties.</P>
<P>Again in some of these Corporations, where
the right of Voting is in the Mayor and Jurats;
in some the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Councel; in others the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Capital Burgesses; in others the Bayliff and Ju∣rats,
and the like, the right of Voting is reduc'd
to so few, and those so Mean and Mercenary,
that they are easily prevail'd with, to chuse such
as they know not, but are recommended by o∣thers.</P>
<P>And,
which is worse, some Towns whose
Charters remain, tho' the Towns themselves seem to
be Dead, are so mean and contemptible, that no∣thing
remains of them but a Despicable Village,
with the Ruins of what they have been.</P>
<P>We think it wou'd be but reasonable, that the
Charters and Priviledges of Towns, shou'd die
with the Towns; and that whereas when they were
Popolous and Rich, they were Represented in
Parliament, because they were so; when they
are Depopulated and Desolate, there can be no
need of any Person to represent them, what can
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
the Members, who have serv'd for the Town of
<HI>Winchelsea</HI> answer, if they were ask'd, who they
Represent, they must Answer they Represent
the Ruins and Vaults, the remain of a good
Old Town, now lying in Heaps; as for the
Inhabitants, they are not to be Nam'd among
the List of the most despicable Endships, or Vil∣lage
in the County.</P>
<P><HI>Branber</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> Old <HI>Sarum, Stockbridge, Gat∣ton,
Quinburro,</HI> and multitudes of Towns the
like, who send up Gentlemen to represent Beg∣gars,
and have had more Mony spent at some of
their Elections, than all the Land in the Parishes
wou'd be worth, if Sold at a Hundred Years
Purchase.</P>
<P>While on the other Hand, a great many good
Towns in <HI>England,</HI> being of more modern Rise
in the World, are not permitted to chuse at all,
and the City of <HI>London</HI> it self, tho' some say it
bears a proportion to Six parts of the Kingdom,
sends but Four Members of it self; and but
Eight in the whole Circumference.</P>
<P>This Inequality, we humbly conceive opens
the Door to the fraudulent practices, which have
all along been made use of in Elections, Buying
of Voices, giving Freedoms in Corporations, to
People Living out of Corporations, on purpose
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
to make Votes, debauching the Electors, make∣ing
whole Towns Drunk, and Feasting them to
Excess for a Month, sometimes two, or more,
in order to engage their Voices.</P>
<P>These things were so Notorious, and withal
so Ruinous to the Gentry themselves, of whom
several Men of plentiful Estates have been mise∣rably
Beggar'd and undone, that the Parliament
wisely took notice of it, and have prohibited the
practice.</P>
<P>But as if the Devil ow'd the Nation a Grudge,
and was rummaging his Invention to find it out;
here is a new project found out, to succeed the
other, which is Ten Fold more the Child of Hell
than that.</P>
<P>Elections were obtain'd by those Clandestine
Vicious ways, only to sit in the House in Ge∣neral;
but here the design seems to be form'd
before-hand, what they wou'd be chosen for,
and the measures concerted, nay we have heard
that it may be known already, and Wagers have
been layd in, or near <HI>Exchange Alley,</HI> which
Company has most Friends in the ensuing Par∣liament,
and how many of the Members of each
Company stand fairest to be chosen.</P>
<P>Those Gentlemen who have Intelligence, suit∣able
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
to such nice Calculations, are equally ca∣pable
of Jobbing the whole Nation; and as is
already noted, having gotten the way of Buying
and Selling, that is jobbing Elections, will soon
influence such Persons to Act, as the Mony they
are able to bid shall direct.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be but a melancholly Thought, to
reflect that the matter of our Succession, shou'd
come to be debated before a Parliament, that had
a Governing number of such Members, who cou'd
imagine but that the settlement of our Crown
wou'd attend the highest bidder, and our fu∣ture
Liberty, Religion, and all that's dear to us,
be Mortgag'd to the Bribes of Forreigners.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King need not keep great Armies
on Foot, Build Ships, and Strengthen himself
at Sea to Ruin us, if the great Affairs of the
Kingdom concerted in Parliament shou'd come
to be prepar'd, manag'd, and byass'd at <HI>Garra∣way</HI>'s
and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Coffee-house, and expos'd to
Sale by a parcel of Stock-Jobbers.</P>
<P>And how shall it be otherwise, they that can
make Members, will always Govern Members;
Creation supposes a Right of disposing, the Gentle∣men
who Buy are Oblig'd to stand in good Terms
with the Broker, least they shou'd find a better
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
Chapman, and leave him in the lurch the next Ele∣ction,
so that by the Nature of the thing, they are
always subject to this Mercenary, Scandalous
thing, call'd a Broker, and he keeps them under
his Girdle, if he bids them Vote for, or against,
they do it, the mischiefs are endles and innumera∣ble
that may at tend it.</P>
<P>To all Men whose Eyes are to be open'd with
Reason and Argument, it shou'd be enough to fill
them with abhorrence, to think that the Scanda∣lous
Mechanick Upstart Mistery of Job-broke∣ing
should grow upon the Nation; that ever
the <HI>English</HI> Nation shou'd suffer themselves to be
Impos'd upon by the New invented ways of a
few Needy Mercinaries, who can turn all Trade
into a Lottery, and make the <HI>Exchange</HI> a Gaming
Table: A thing, which like the Imaginary Coins
of Foreign Nations, have no reality in them∣selves;
but are plac'd as things which stand to be
Calculated, and Reduc'd into Value, a Trade
made up of Sharp and Trick, and manag'd with
Impudence and Banter.</P>
<P>That Six or Eight Men shall Combine toge∣ther,
and by pretended Buying or Selling among
themselves, raise or sink the Stock of the <HI>E. India</HI>
Company, to what extravagant pitch of Price
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
they will, so to wheedle others sometimes to
Buy, sometimes to Sell, as their occasions re∣quire;
and with so little regard to Intrinsick
Value, or the circumstances of the Company,
that when the Company has a loss, Stock shall
Rise; when a great Sale, or a Rich Ship arriv'd,
it shall Fall: Sometimes run the Stock down to
35<HI>l.</HI> other times up to a 150<HI>l.</HI> and by this Me∣thod
Buy and Sell so much, that 'tis thought
there are few of the Noted Stock-jobbers, but what
have bought and sold more Stock than both the
Companies possess.</P>
<P>Thus let them Jobb, Trick, and Cheat one
another; and let them be bubbl'd by them that
know no better; but for God's sake, Gentlemen,
do not let the Important Affairs of the State
come under their wicked clutches.</P>
<P>Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parlia∣ment,
and then Chuse Members to Vote for
them. If Fate and <HI>Popish</HI> Confederacies, and Union
of <HI>Popish</HI> Powers abroad threaten us: Let us alone
to struggle with them, and have Fair Law, and
Honourable Conditions for it; but to be Bought
and Sold, to have our Elections of Members, and
our Laws, Liberties and Estates Stock-jobb'd
away, is intollerable.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Some, and not a few, of our Stock-jobbing
Brokers, are <HI>French</HI> Men, a little Correspondence
between the <HI>French Court,</HI> and <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s <HI>Coffee-house,</HI>
with a Currency of <HI>Louis D'ors,</HI> will make
strange alterations here, if this method of Buy∣ing
and Jobbing Elections shou'd go on.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> is the Governing
Council; their Breath is our Law, and on their
Breath under the Direction of God's Providence,
we all depend, the greatest Nicety that is possi∣ble
should be us'd in chusing Men of untainted
Principles, and unquestion'd Wisdom, to com∣pose
a Body so Eminent in their Power and In∣fluence.</P>
<P>But
to attempt to fill the House with Mecha∣nicks,
Trades-men, Stock-jobbers, and Men nei∣ther
of Sense nor Honesty, is tricking at the
Root, and undermining the Nation's Felicity
at once; and 'tis a wonder the impudence of
this attempt has not made them Stink in the
Nostrils of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>How can the King be encourag'd to place
that confidence in his People, which he men∣tions
in the late <HI>Proclamation,</HI> by which People,
his Majesty understands, the true Representative
Body Assembled in Parliament, if instead of a
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
true Representative, the House is fill'd with
Elections Clandestinly procur'd by Tricks and
Shams impos'd upon the People.</P>
<P>How can the King depend upon his Parlia∣ment,
to carry him thro' any thing he shall un∣dertake
by their advice, if mercenary Men fill
the House, whose Suffrages shall be guided by
the Bribes and private procurations of his, and the
Nations Enemies?</P>
<P>How shall the Protestant Religion be Espous'd,
and Defended, which wise Men say is in great
Danger?</P>
<P>How shall Trade be Encourag'd, and Protec∣ted,
and the Niceties of it Dsputed and Defend∣ed?</P>
<P>How
shall Reformation of Manners, which
is so much wanted, and which the King
has so often Recommended, be promoted?</P>
<P>Are Stock-jobbers, Agents of Regiments, Tay∣lors,
and <HI>East India</HI> Companies, Qualifi'd for
these Works; or will any sort of Men, who Pur∣chase
Elections with Mony, to bring to pass
private Interests and Parties, Espouse these Ge∣neral
Cases on which the Welfare of the Nation
depends.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
Tell a Stock-jobber of the Union of <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain;</HI> of the <HI>Muscovites</HI> breaking the Peace;
of the Difference between the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the Duke
of <HI>Holstein,</HI> Tell him of a good Barrier in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>
against the <HI>French,</HI> or of Assisting the <HI>Em∣peror</HI>
on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> (talk Gospel to a Kettle Drum)
'tis all Excentrick and Foreign to him: But talk
of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and the Pirates of <HI>Madagas∣car;</HI>
of Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> and St. <HI>Helena,</HI> there
you'll hit him, and he turns States-man pre∣sently.</P>
<P>It
was a Famous Stock-Jobber; and one who
is very likely to be a Parliament Man, who when
some body was talking lately of the Election of
the New <HI>Pope;</HI> and having heard the particulars
very attentively, brought out this very grave
Question at the end ont. Well! says he, I am
glad 'tis over, and don't you think that <HI>Stock</HI>
will rise upon't.</P>
<P>A Learned Question upon the Case, truly;
upon which, pray give us leave to ask ano∣ther;
<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="3 words" DISP=" _____ _____ _____ "/> And is't not pity, <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="3 words" DISP=" _____ _____ _____ "/> 
But such a one should Represent the City?</P>
<P>You <HI>Londoners</HI> may make them Sheriffs, Al∣dermen,
and Deputies, and Common-Councel
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
Men, and welcome; you know them, and they
can hurt no body but themselves.</P>
<P>But when you come to talk of Parliament
Men, Gentlemen, pray consider, 'tis the whole
Nation lies at Stake, a Man may set his own
House on Fire, and welcome, provided it stands
by it self, and neither hurts nor endangers no
bodies else, and the Law has nothing to say to
him; but if it stands in a Town, or a City, he
deserves to be Hang'd, for he may burn out, and
undo his Neighbours.</P>
<P>Nor are you chusing Men to sit in Parlia∣ment,
as Persons to Act for you only whom
they Represent; but they are Representatives
in a double capacity, separately consider'd, every
Member Represents the People who chuse him,
and all together Represent the whole Nation.
Their right to sit is separately Devolv'd; but
their right in Act, is conjunctively Inherent,
every Man Represents the whole, and Acts for
the whole, tho' he is sent but from part.</P>
<P>The Fate of <HI>Bristol,</HI> or <HI>New Castle,</HI> may be deci∣ded
by a Member of <HI>London,</HI> or <HI>Canterbury,</HI> whose
Vote on an equality of Voices carries it which
way he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28"/>
Therefore <HI>London</HI> cannot say to <HI>Bristol,</HI> or <HI>New-Castle,</HI>
What have you to do with our Election?
or they to <HI>London,</HI> What have you to do with
ours; why one bad Member may ruin a City,
a Town, or Family, a Person, or perhaps all to∣gether;
and if any Town, or City, or Burrough,
or private Person, is pleas'd to give a Friendly
Admonition or Caution to another, especially if
they seem to be proceeding against their own, or
the Nation's Interest, they ought to accept the
Hint, and reflect upon what they are doing with
Honesty, and reform it.</P>
<P>Upon this, we hope it shall be justified, that
we have ventur'd to lay open the Villanous prac∣tices
of some People to corrupt and procure E∣lections,
in order to get Members into the en∣suing
Parliament, who shall serve a Turn, and a
Party, without considering whether they are
Men qualified for the other great Affairs, which
are to be consider'd there, and which His Maje∣sty
has assur'd us, are of the highest Importance
to the Kingdom.</P>
