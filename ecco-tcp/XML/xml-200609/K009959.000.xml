<HEAD>THE
PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1711, <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Prophet, who
formrrly Prophesied and Foretold you so many Remarkable
Things, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1707; all which, as is well known, are
most exactly come to pass; and having by my Knowledge and
Acquaintance for above One Hundred Years with the Stars, and
with utmost diligence applied my self to know by the Aspects of
Heavenly Bodies and other Methods; also what shall happen on
the Earth. I say, that I the aforesaid <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
am moved, as well by Astrological Vision, as the especial <HI>Genius</HI>
of those Powers which influences human Bodies, to make known
to the World what shall come to pass.</P>
<P>By this Prophetick Skill, I once amongst other well known E∣vents
Predicted and Foretold you, That <HI>John Partridge</HI> the
Almanack-maker should Die, and be Buried on, or before such a
day of the Month, which, as you all know, came to pass to a
Moment.</P>
<P>Having therefore obtained such an undoubted Skill and Judg∣ment
in these most useful and advantageous Things: I can no
longer refrain from letting my Country-men of this Nation, know
the great Revolutions of Kingdoms and States, and the dread∣ful
Things that shall suddenly come to pass in the Earth. I am
also the more earnestly moved to this great and wonderful Vnder∣taking,
because it is revealed to me by the same wonderful Pro∣phetick
Skill, that such great and terrible Things, such surpri∣zing
Events, and such Dessolations, are preparing in the World,
and shall come to pass this ensuing Year, as were never seen by
the Eyes of any Living, or would enter into the Conceptions of
any Man to foretell, had they not by an extraordinary acquired
Skill in knowing and determining such Things, been foreseen by
me <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>Sen</HI></P>
<P>And thus, honest Reader, being nothing doubting of thy dili∣gent
Attention to what I shall Prophesie, I bid thee Farewell.</P>

The <HI>British Visions</HI>; or, <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI>'s,
Twelve Prophesies for the Year, 1711.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY I.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall begin my Years of Wonders as the Course of
Nature begins it; Councils and Confederacies act
all the Courts and Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the time of
Year is only for such Things; but as here the Seeds
of Blood are sown, the plentiful Crop that is to follow,
derives from and is produced by the Private Combina∣tions
of Men and Devils to disturb the World.</P>
<P>Three Scenes of Council shall this Month discover them∣selves
in the World, what the Production or Effects shall
be of either of them, I shall farther lay open in my next;
these are Councils in this Nation, Councils of <HI>France,</HI>
Councils of <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>The Councils of this Nation shall produce great Strife,
Faction and Malecontent stirs, with Heat and Animosi∣ties
among the several Parties that are among us, to the
great Encouragement of our Enemies, and to the great
Discouragement of good Men; yet the Calmness and Pru∣dence
of some shall lessen, or at least protract the Danger
for a while; Disputes of Ecclesiastick Affairs shall em∣broil
this Island, and those People who regard neither
God nor Devil, shall make the greatest stir about Reli∣gion,
every Church (however safe) cries out they are
in danger, and the Debauchees of the Nation learn to
play the Pharisee, and say to their Neighbour, <HI>Stand off,
I am holier than thou.</HI></P>
<P>Let <HI>Europe</HI> tremble at what is contriving now in the
Cabinets of Princes, which, like the Seeds of Distem∣pers
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
in the Body, will quickly break out in Feavors,
Fluxes, Cankers, Calentures, and all the Symbals of
the Bodily Distempers of Men in the Politicks of Na∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> consults now how to support <HI>Spain,</HI> embroil
the Emperor, bring home the <HI>Swede,</HI> restore <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
doze <HI>Savoy,</HI> fright the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and divide the <HI>English,</HI>
and he will in some Measure accomplish them all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turk</HI> consults how to humble the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> sub∣ject
the <HI>Pole,</HI> and keep fast the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>; but
the <HI>Swede</HI> will make a Cats Foot of the <HI>Turk.</HI> play him a
slipery Trick, get out of his hands, and leave him to
fight with the <HI>Muscovites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> where the War
shall be bloody, cruel, successful to neither side, and only
useful to shew God's Judgments on both.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY II.</HEAD>
<P>After Consultations comes Preparation, this takes up
all <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Return of the Spring, every Na∣tion
Struggles with themselves to make their Preparati∣ons
for War formidable, and with one another to be
first ready for the Bloody Work they are about.</P>
<P>The Confederates attempt vigorously to succour King
<HI>Charles</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> but, <HI>O the Success!</HI>—<HI>Spain</HI> not yet
ripe for Deliverance resists her Friends, embraces her
Enemies, and struggles hard against what she believes she
must at last submit to.</P>
<P>But this is not the Generation that must enjoy the
Fruit of this Strife, the Chiefs fight for the Possession,
neither part obtain it, both take their long Journey be∣fore
the War is over, and the Game at Chess is left to
Posterity to play it out. <HI>Philip</HI> goes first, I <HI>Isaac Bicker∣staff,</HI>
Elder, having the Second sight, see the famous Mau∣soleum
for the young Hero of <HI>Bourbon</HI> in the Escurial at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and there lies the hope of a Crown, yet the
<HI>French</HI> Monarch with the same Obstinacy supports the
War, maintains the Breach, and prompts the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
still to defend themselves against their own Happiness.
<HI>Philip</HI> before he dies fights three Battles with the Confede∣rates,
and is Victor in two of them, but dies in <HI>May,</HI> and
leaves the War to be carried on with less Success than be∣fore;
should it be left to the Merits of the Persons, <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>
deserves the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> far better than <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s,</HI> as
he appears active, valiant, brave, and unwearied in the
Face of his Enemies, however he dies King, and Sleeps
in Peace, tho' he never Reigned so.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Swedes</HI> prepare to break out of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> and
it appears that <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Swedes</HI> are in a strict Con∣federacy,
and they shall be more fatal to <HI>Europe</HI> than the
League with the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> sending Forces from <HI>Stockholm</HI> carry the
Plague into <HI>Pomerania,</HI> from whence it spreads to the ut∣most
Corners of <HI>Europe</HI>; Kings and Emperors, shall flye
from this dreadful Enemy, but find no Recess; Plague finds
them out, and as War spreads, Pestilence goes hand in
hand, and both shall consume and destroy without Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> is all busie in fitting out their Armies, the Drums
beat in every Kingdom for Soldiers, not a Prince or State
in this whole part of the World, but shall be embark'd
in the Quarrels of <HI>Europe,</HI> and be engag'd in War either
as Principal or as Auxilary.</P>
<P>The Armies of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are in the Field first,
and much Blood shall be shed in <HI>Spain</HI> before the end of
<HI>February.</HI> The Confederates Struggle hard, but Things
do not answer the Expence.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY III.</HEAD>
<P>The Preparations for War are finish'd, now the Troops
on all sides appear in the Field; a third Battle in <HI>Spain</HI>—<HI>Philip</HI>'s
Forces flie in their Turn, tho' no great advan∣tage
made of the Victory. In <HI>March</HI> the <HI>French</HI> make two
great Efforts upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> one to join the <HI>Swede,</HI> who
Marches towards the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> towards <HI>Saxony</HI>;
the other towards <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the <HI>Germans</HI> in no readi∣ness
to receive them, suffer all manner of Mischiefs.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
The Dauphin of <HI>France</HI> dies; the Pope sickens and is
very weak; the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> relapses; but the King of
<HI>France</HI> more vigorous than ever, pushes all before him
the beginning of Summer.</P>
<P>A great Prodigy appears in the East; two Kings strug∣gling
to make it appear which was the better Christian,
he that changed his Religion to gain a Crown, or he that
flies to <HI>Mahomet</HI> to recover his Crown. The <HI>Turks</HI> ad∣vance
now in three great Armies, and one Battle is fought
before the end of <HI>March,</HI> in which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
gains some ground, but is wounded in the Action, and
makes no Advantage of the Battle.</P>
<P>Now the miserable Fate of <HI>Europe</HI> approaches, the
War begins in <HI>Poland, Muscovy, Hungary,</HI> on the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
and in <HI>Spain.</HI> In <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> they cannot be ready
so soon.</P>
<P>A great Battle on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in which
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> do as they use to do, <HI>viz.</HI> run away; the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> ravage <HI>Portugal,</HI> ruin three Provinces; if these
were not <HI>Portuguese,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had not had the Victory;
and if these were not <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> would be
no more a Kingdom, but the sloth of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> saves
<HI>Portugal</HI> till <HI>England</HI> relieve her.</P>
<P>A great Minister of State dies in the Month of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P><HI>England</HI> feels great want of Trade, great want of Mo∣ney,
and great loss of Credit, which puts her to many
Inconveniencies; but let her prepare for worse Things
than these.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY IV.</HEAD>
<P>Note, <HI>In this place in the Original Manuscript, the following
Paragraph was Inserted, which the Printer in the</HI> North <HI>de∣clin'd
to put in, for fear of giving Offence.</HI></P>
<P>The Words are these,<Q>The House of <HI>Austria</HI> feels a Blow this Month,
which Changes the Measures of <HI>Europe</HI>; The
Emperor resigns to Fate; and the Choise both of
a new Emperor, and new King of <HI>Spain,</HI> takes up
the Consultations of all the Courts in Christen∣dom.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The Empire feels hard Things, beset on every side, and
weak in Arms, as well as confused in Council, the
<HI>Swedes</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> invade <HI>Bavaria</HI>; the <HI>Hungarians</HI>
supported by the <HI>Turks</HI> recover all they have lost in <HI>Hun∣gary</HI>;
the <HI>French</HI> make a terrible Eruption over the
<HI>Rhine</HI>; the Circles of <HI>Swabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> suffer incre∣dible
Evils, and Blood, Famine, and Pestilence, rages
over the Empire.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> restored to his Dominions by the
<HI>French,</HI> dies of the Plague in <HI>April,</HI> and the Affairs of that
Electorate come to some Settlement by the succeeding of
his Son, who has other Things to mind than War. The
Elector of <HI>Cologn,</HI> Brother to the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> goes to see
his Brother reinstated, but lives not to return to his own
Principality.</P>
<P>The Emperor retreats from <HI>Vienna</HI> for fear of the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and goes to <HI>Prague,</HI> but the Plague
gets into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and separates the Imperial Court:
some great Princes die of that Distemper also.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>April</HI> a great City in <HI>Flanders</HI> besieged
by the <HI>French,</HI> but the Confederates coming on, they
raise their Siege; they are made amends by surprizing
another strong Town in the middle of the Day. A Bloody
Action in <HI>Flanders</HI> between part of the Armies, in which
the <HI>French</HI> seem to have the Advantage, but decline com∣ing
to a decisive Battle, and draw off from the Field.
Death in this Battle puts an end to the Ambition of two
or three great Men on either side. <HI>Bousslers</HI> lies now in
the Bed of Honour, and his Grace <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> shall bear
him Company into the other World, so he that was en∣vied
before shall be pitied now for want of a Rival.</P>
<P>In the same <HI>April</HI> King <HI>Philip</HI>'s Forces Bombard <HI>Barcelo∣na,</HI>
but Relief comes to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and in his turn he
chases them; now the Face of Things change in <HI>Spain,</HI>
and <HI>Philip</HI>'s Fate approaches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Danes</HI> now prepare to invade <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nen,</HI> and make
another fruitless Attempt upon the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Countries, from whence they are again beaten, and bring
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
back Poverty and the Plague, which not only visits their
Capital City, but makes sad havock in their Court, not
excepting the Royal Family.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> demits his Crown in favour of
his Son, and submits to go the way of all Princes. This
Year is fatal to Crownd Heads.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY V.</HEAD>
<P>Now <HI>Europe</HI> begins to Tremble, the People find an
Employment different from the War, the Living having
Work enough to Bury their Dead.</P>
<P>By the end of <HI>May</HI> the various kinds of this new
Plague has Touch'd most parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> as
before bring it to <HI>Pomeren,</HI> thence they carry it to <HI>Saxony
(Via Brandenburgh)</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> give it to the <HI>Bohemians,</HI>
the <HI>Bohemians</HI> to the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> they to the <HI>Grisons,</HI> and
they again to the <HI>Smiss.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hungarians</HI> bring it another way from <HI>Poland,</HI>
and carrying it into <HI>Croatia,</HI> it Crosses the <HI>Adriatick</HI> to
<HI>Italy,</HI> and siezes upon the <HI>Venetian</HI>; from thence it pushes
into <HI>Milan,</HI> and visiting <HI>Turin,</HI> it passes thro' <HI>Rome</HI> to the
Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> and in spight of the interruption of
Commerce by the War, crosses over into <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>Innumerable Numbers of People shall perish by this
desolating Distemper; yet the World, as if the Hand of
Heaven did not, or could not, destroy them fast enough,
still make War, and the Kings of the Earth apply them∣selves
to their ruinous Designs, with as much fury as ever.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> now appears in his own Colours,
and shall in the Month of <HI>May</HI> be in full march to enter
<HI>Poland,</HI> if not <HI>Germany</HI>; but his Army consisting of many
Nations, new raised and undisciplin'd, wasts away with∣out
much Fighting and he may see that Heaven does
not bless his Ambitious Designs with success answerable
to his Expectations: Three of his greatest Generals,
and in whom was his chief Confidence, die of the
Plague; and tho' he gains some advantage, he can make
no great use of it, his power being lessened by the other
Accidents of War.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
The <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Muscovite,</HI> 150000 Men of a side
draw towards one another, but the Decisive Stroke is not
yet, many bloody Skirmishes happen between the <HI>Tartars</HI>
and the <HI>Cossacks</HI> against the <HI>Muscovite.</HI></P>
<P>The Month of <HI>May</HI> lays King <HI>Philip</HI> low in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
<HI>Charles</HI> Triumphs over his Enemy a third time, but his
Joy, like all Temporal things, is but of a small duration.
The War in <HI>Spain</HI> costs much Money, much Blood, much
Counsel, but does not fully answer our end: Many a
brave <HI>English</HI> Man leaves his Bones in that Country, whose
Blood might have been better spent.</P>
<P>Another Bloody Action between the Armies on the
side of <HI>Germany,</HI> in which much Blood is lost, and both
sides give GOD praise for being beaten.</P>
<P>This Year is a Year rather of Blood than of Victory,
no <HI>Bleinhim,</HI> no <HI>Pultowa:</HI> No Decisive Battle happens any
where on this side <HI>Hungary,</HI> yet more Men killed than
would be in many such Battles.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY VI.</HEAD>
<P>As the hot Weather comes on, Men's Blood grows
warm, this subjects and exposes them to fatal mischiefs,
the plague of War, and the War of Plague. <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Ger∣many</HI>
have by this time felt the fury of the Contagion, and
dreadful Ravages have been made in all the populous Na∣tions
on that side.</P>
<P>Shall <HI>Britain</HI> be free! flatter not your selves with Ex∣pectations
of it, many Plagues visit this Nation and whole
Parties of Men suffer the Infection; all sorts of Men shall
die, some politickly, some really; the Grave makes no
Distinction of <HI>Whigg</HI> or <HI>Tory,</HI> High or Low <HI>Church.</HI> Three
Bishops go off the Stage first, Dukes, Earls, Barons and
Privy-Counsellors follow; a great Rot falls among the
Court-Sheep, and the Murrain upon the Stallions of this
<HI>Sodomitish</HI> City. The Infection spares none: But alas, for
the Sheepherds of our Flocks! they fly, and leave their
Flocks to be scatter'd.</P>
<P>But let them remember it from <HI>Isaac Bickerstaff</HI>'s Words,
the Sheepherds that forsake the Sheep committed to their
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Charge, shall fall in their flight, when those that stay shall
remain. In this general Desolation it is not difficult for
me to Name you Persons by Titles and Sirnames, that
shall be infected with Plagues of one sort and another,
whose Eyes shall not see the end of these things, but the
Number is too great, and you cannot bear the distinction
of Persons at this time.</P>
<P>Let it be sufficient then to tell you, Your Desolation is
beyond expression, and the Number, whose Carkasses shall
fall in this Wilderness, is not to be Number'd.</P>
<P>Yet for the encouragement and support of the Poor,
Heaven promises Plenty in the Fields, and there shall be no
want of Bread; Food shall encrease, tho' not the Mouths
that feed on it; and what the Sword or other Plagues
shall devour, shall leave room for those that remain to
Live with more abundance.</P>
<P>Yet for all these Terrors, Men shall not repent or abate
their Divisions, their Animosities, their Wars, and pur∣suit
of Blood over the Earth.</P>
<P>About this time, a terrible and bloody Battle happens
between the <HI>Swedes</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> against the <HI>Germans,</HI>
and much blood shed, but the Emperor's Affairs are not
yet ripe for Deliverance; and he must be a second time
saved by the Protestant Allies, or be lost for good and all.
The <HI>French</HI> now Master several Towns and large Terri∣tories,
and if ever <HI>Bavaria</HI> is Restor'd, it's now.</P>
<P>But strange Resistance is preparing against those mis∣chiefs,
tho' no effect is seen this year, the next will pro∣duce
something more effectual.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY VII.</HEAD>
<P>Now the World, Ripe for Action, is altogether by the
Ears, and Blood rages in all parts of <HI>Europe</HI>; <HI>France</HI> has
gone on with too much Success, but receives a check, vo∣mits
up much of his rapid Conquests, and by the vigour of
the Confederates, is made to doubt whether he can keep
his own or no, yet he stoops not to make offers of Peace,
but swells with Pride and Revenge. <HI>Germany</HI> seems to be a
general Scene of blood, and finds it next to impossible to
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
avoid falling into the War with the <HI>Turks</HI>; the <HI>Swedes</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> insult her in their Turn, and make three
large Incisions into her most tender parts.</P>
<P><HI>Sweden</HI> grows great, War and Diffassection, together
with want of Money and Strength, distresses the <HI>Pole,</HI> yet
they Fight with Obstinacy against all: The <HI>Muscovite</HI>
pushes the <HI>Turk</HI> in his Turn, and revives things on that
side: But this Year decides not the Fate of <HI>Poland.</HI> The
Protestant Interest gains nothing by this cruel War, either
in <HI>Germany, Silesia,</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> yet hopes and promises
support them, and they dispair not yet.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> lies still; now the Sun keeps the Peace there, the
excessive heats give a recess from Action, and gives time
to our ungovernable Soldiers to kill themselves with Eat∣ing
ripe Grapes, Drinking new Wine, and gorging them∣selves
with the Luscious Fruits of a Luxurious Climate. A
new General and new Councils produce new effects there,
but the Army suffers much by Diseases, for which we sup∣ply
the Grave with new Recruits for the <HI>Antum</HI> Campaign.</P>
<P>A rich plentiful Harvest in <HI>Britain</HI> makes the Hearts of
the Country glad, and <HI>Britain</HI> proves this Year the Grana∣ry
of <HI>Europe</HI>; a great increase, and a good Market, re∣vives
our Commerce, but we want this Relief, for we
have many Losses abroad, and dreadful Diseases at home,
affecting the Bodies or Minds of the People.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="8" TYPE="prophecy">
<HEAD>PROPHECY VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Among the several Armies that range <HI>Europe,</HI> none es∣cape
a most bloody Action but these in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The
<HI>Swedes,</HI> the <HI>Poles,</HI> the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Germans,</HI>
make War, not after the new, but the old fashion, and
Fight as it were by mutual consent whereever they meet;
so that every Post now brings News of Battles, and
Slaughter: About <HI>August</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Muscovites</HI> Fight
a terrible Battle, Victory mocks both sides, and both
sides mock the World with their pretences to it, yet the
<HI>Turks</HI> appear sooner in the Field again, and seem to feel
the loss least, tho they have most Men in the Roll of
Slaughter.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
If the real Plague spreads near us, it is this same Month,
GOD preserve our populous Towns from such a stroke,
the Desolation of, <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where yet they tell us a Fifth
part of the People perish'd, will be a Flea-bite to what
we must suffer, but the Prophet tells you, <HI>If you escape
this Year, you should not flatter your selves about the next.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> may expect a bloody Campaign, if the <HI>Swedes</HI>
are beaten in <HI>Poland,</HI> for if that Monarch finds his Work
hard on that side, he encreases his Stength for diversion on
another: <HI>Denmark</HI> seems this Year to borrow the old
Character of the <HI>Muscovites,</HI> neither fit for War or Peace,
for they make nothing of their Attempts any where, and
are beaten every where.</P>
<P>A fruitless War upon the <HI>Alps,</HI> where Men Fight with
Mountains, and Rocks are frighted with Snow and Tor∣rents
of Water, struggle hard with Nature and Art, and
go home with little or nothing.</P>

<P><HI>Spain</HI> moves again about <HI>September,</HI> and the Armies,
tho' weaknened by Fluxes and Feavers, draw out. Now!
if at all <HI>Charles</HI>'s Affairs revive, yet the <HI>French</HI> struggle
hard, and part with what they lose but by Inches. Two
bloody Actions weaken both sides, and they take breath a
while, but <HI>Charles</HI>'s gains Ground, tho' with great loss of
Men.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> supplies <HI>Spain</HI> with Men, <HI>Spain France</HI> with Mo∣ney.
Great Advantages arrive from the Supplies, both
receive from the West <HI>Indian</HI> Treasures, and great Losses
befall some People the latter end of the Summer by
Sea, to the Discouragement of Trade, and Ruin of the
Merchants.</P>
<P>Another terrible battle in the Northern Countries;
the <HI>Muscovite</HI> grows strong by being beaten, and the
<HI>Swede</HI> weak by Victory. The <HI>Turk</HI> makes great Havock
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and ravages great part of <HI>Poland. Hungary</HI>
begins to stir, and the Emperor feels the Effects of suffer∣ing

side.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> ends the Campaign Inglorious on every side,
and tho' he has not so much loss this year as he has for∣merly
met with, yet finds himself languish under the Ex∣pence,
his Kingdom wasting, exhausted and gasping, and
makes Overtures of a Treaty, but it comes to nothing
for want of Sincerity.</P>

<HEAD>PROPHECY X.</HEAD>
<P>The Flux of Blood abates, the Season about <HI>October</HI> en∣clines
the Parties, out of breath with a long Campaign, to
draw off, and give over; in <HI>Dauphine</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> dare
not stay to act on this side the <HI>Alps,</HI> or the <HI>French</HI> on the
other for fear of being cut off from their Retreat by the
Snow on the Mountains; so they end the Campaign with
mutual Loss, mutual Mischief, and having mutually done
nothing worth Notice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> push still on fighting against Elements as
well as Enemies, with invincible Obstinacy, and resolve
to Winter in the heart of <HI>Poland</HI>; a Country wasted by
War, and more likely to starve the Armies in their Quar∣ters,
than refresh them.</P>
<P>Cold weather freezes up the Plague, and the Desola∣tions
of that kind abate; but let them not comfort them∣selves
with the Notion of a Deliverance from it, because
of an Intermission.</P>
<P>The Armies on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and in <HI>Flanders</HI> separate,
and may cast up their Accounts if they please; they find
on every side Loss and Decay of Strength, much Blood,
much Treasure spent, many Nations ravaged and ruined,
and the end of the Campaign looks still but like the be∣ginning
of the War, yet <HI>Spain</HI> has no Recess, but both
sides prepare for a Winter War; here we begin to see a
new Turn, and King <HI>Charles</HI> may bid fair for a third
Visit to <HI>Madrid,</HI> yet he keeps not all he gains; and
Treaty rather than Battle seems to be the end of that War
at last.</P>

<HEAD>PROPHECY XI.</HEAD>
<P>The Generals now come home, make their Report,
exalt the Merits of their own Actions, emulate and decry
one another, and the Unfortunate bear the Load of ill Con∣duct,
according to the Custom and Usage of Mankind.</P>
<P>The active part of the War being quite over they stand
still, and take breath awhile, till the Winter Quarters
being settled, the great Ones come to lay their Heads to∣gether
for the next Year.</P>
<P>Some further Abortive Conceptions of Peace appear in
the World, amuse the Parties a while, and then vanish
again; yet on the one side of <HI>Europe</HI> a formal Treaty be∣gins,
is carried on with Cunning and Insincerity on both
sides, and ends in renewing the War.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> is still the Seat of Action, we gain Ground, but
lose a World of Men, and some Relief miscarries; which Dis∣appointment
retards the Proceedings, and baulks a very
hopeful Prospect, yet they push hard, and have hopes of
success; a great Province revolts and changes Hands,
which gives a new Turn to Things; but want of strength
delays finishing the Work this Year, and before that De∣fect
is supply'd, some Ground is lost again.</P>

<HEAD>PROPHECY XII.</HEAD>
<P>Now the World enters into Council, Parliaments, As∣semblies
of Estates, Regencies, Divans, Grand Councils
of War, meeting of Generals and Mareschals, take up all
the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI>; nothing of Peace is heard among
them, but <HI>carrying on the War with vigour</HI> is the Word,
Taxes for raising Money, and Money for raising Men,
filling of Magazines, refitting of Navies, and recruiting
Armies is the Language of all this part of the World.</P>
<P>Would the great Men of <HI>Europe</HI> bring all their Accounts
together, would they cast up their Accounts, and bring
the Ballance of the whole to one foot of Profit and Loss,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
the Madness of Mankind would appear monstrous, and
be seen in its own Colours. A Million of Lives have been
lost this Year by War, Pestilence and Famine. Vast
Treasures exhausted beyond the possibility of Account,
Countries wasted, Cities ruined, Villages burnt, Fron∣tiers
plundered, yet the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> prepare to car∣ry
on the furious Quarrel, as if nothing but the Destru∣ction
of Mankind was in their Design. In <HI>Spain</HI> the War
goes on still, and Winter gives no Recess; a warm Action
concludes the Year, in which both sides suffer loss. The
Confederates have the Advantage, yet no great gain is
made of the Matter. The VVar is push'd on with great
Animosity and Indefatigable Vigour of the Commanders
with great loss of Blood on both sides; but this Year
gives no View of the End.</P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>Thus have I, <HI>Bickerstaff</HI> the Aged, given you a View
of this fatal Year that is yet to come, the Sum of the
Matter lies in a few Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>France</HI> gains at first by exerting her self with uncommon
Vigour, but loses again both her Glory and her Advan∣tages
before the end of the Campaign.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Britain</HI> is at a vast Expence, rather gains than loses,
but not suitable to her Occasion any more than to her Ex∣pectation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Muscovite</HI> suffers vast Losses, yet gains Ground.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Swedes</HI> gets Victory with little profit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Turks</HI> makes great Spoil with very little gain.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Poles</HI> have some Advantages, by which they are
ruined.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Empire is delivered from Peace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>Dane</HI> by want of Success delivered from the VVar.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>On every side <HI>Europe</HI> is afflicted, plagued harassed and
ravaged by the VVar, and yet sees no end of her Sorrows:
VVhat shall befall her in the year to come, shall be also
foretold in its Season by me.</P>
