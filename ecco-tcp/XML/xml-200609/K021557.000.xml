<HEAD>ARGUMENTS About the ALTERATION of <HI>TRIENNIAL ELECTIONS</HI> OF
PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER to a Friend in the Country.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR last Letter expresses your great Concerns and Fears about the Design now on foot for the Alteration of the <HI>Act for the frequent Meeting and Calling of Parliaments</HI> in one Particular, that is, the Changing the <HI>Term</HI> for <HI>Elections</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> from <HI>three</HI> to <HI>more</HI> Years; and at the same time gives me an Account of the several <HI>Objections,</HI> which make the greatest Noise around you upon that Subject. The same <HI>Fears,</HI> and the same <HI>Objections,</HI> I find to be very common, and very warmly pro∣pagated in all Conversations here in Town.</P>
<P>For my self, I acknowledge that it is with <HI>me,</HI> in <HI>this</HI> Case, as it is in many others of Impor∣tance; the <HI>first Surprize</HI> gave me the like <HI>Uneasiness</HI> to what you express: But I am very well satisfied, that the most likely Way to cure that Uneasiness, is, to debate the Matter as Friends; and to exa∣mine, Whether that <HI>Surprize</HI> be the Force of <HI>meer Prejudice,</HI> or of good Judgment. And for this, I am very sure, I am in one Respect, at least, well qualified, That as to my own private Advantage, or Interest, it is not of the least Importance to me, Whether the <HI>Parliament</HI> may, with the Consent of the <HI>King,</HI> sit <HI>three</HI> Years, or <HI>seven</HI> Years, or <HI>twenty</HI> Years. I have no Designs, nor Views; no <HI>Piques,</HI> nor <HI>Resentments;</HI> to incline me one way or other: And therefore, if you will put your self into the same <HI>Posture</HI> of Mind, we will, if you please, enter upon this Subject.</P>
<P>In all <HI>Debates</HI> of this Nature, there are <HI>Two</HI> prin∣cipal Points, which will comprehend under them all other Particulars. The <HI>One</HI> is, Whether the Thing proposed be <HI>lawful,</HI> with regard to the Na∣ture of our Constitution? The <HI>Other</HI> is, Whether it be <HI>expedient,</HI> or <HI>useful,</HI> to the Good Ends which ought always to be in the View of those who make Laws?</P>
<P>The <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of the Thing can't be denied by any Persons, tho' never so great Enemies to the doing it. Nor do I find, amongst all the <HI>Topicks</HI> employed against it, that any thing of Moment is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Right or Authority of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Legislature</HI> to do it. It is no more <HI>a Funda∣mental</HI> of our <HI>Constitution,</HI> That a <HI>New Parliament</HI> must be summon'd every <HI>three Years,</HI> than at any other Interval. It is equally just, as far as <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> are concern'd, for the <HI>King, Lords</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> to six it for <HI>one</HI> Term, as for <HI>another:</HI> And if it were not out of their <HI>Right</HI> to make that <HI>Great Alteration,</HI> which fix'd it for <HI>three</HI> Years, it certainly cannot be out of their <HI>Right</HI> to make a much less <HI>Alteration,</HI> by fixing it once more to another Term.</P>
<P>As to the Sense and Mind of the Electors, the Truth of the Matter is this: They are sup∣pos'd to have no other View in their Choice of Persons, than to send such to Parliament as they think best qualified, by their Estates, Wisdom and Integrity, to do whatever is to be done in Par∣liament, without regard to the Time of their Sit∣ting there. And there is no other End in the ele∣cting Representatives, but that they, from Time to Time, may make, and alter Laws, in such man∣ner as best to consult and promote the Good of the whole Community: The very Election is, and must be supposed to impower the Elected Persons, faithfully, and impartially, to do every Thing that is necessary, or expedient, for the Pre∣servation and Establishment of the Common In∣terest, whether it falls in with the Humours or Opinions of the Electors, or not. This brings us to the only Point to be consider'd, when any <HI>Alteration</HI> of a former <HI>Changeable Law</HI> is proposed; and that is, Whether, (all Things consider'd,) it be <HI>Expedient</HI> and <HI>Useful?</HI></P>
<P>And of this, as far as the Time past is con∣cern'd, <HI>Experience</HI> is the best Judge. When a
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<HI>Law</HI> hath been long tried, and the <HI>Consequences</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of it in a Nation, have been many Years open and sensible, it requires but little Thought to judge, whether it be best to continue it in eve∣ry Respect, as it is, or to model it anew. And now, if you please, we will consider the <HI>Effect</HI> the <HI>Triennial Elections</HI> have had amongst our selves at <HI>Home;</HI> and then it will be proper to think of the <HI>Effect</HI> they have had, and still must naturally have, <HI>Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Home,</HI> the least Evil is, that the <HI>Tempers</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> of Men are put into a <HI>Fermen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and boil'd up into a <HI>Rage,</HI> which never is cooled, because the Returns, at which this <HI>Rage</HI> is useful to some Persons or other, are so <HI>quick,</HI> that it is not <HI>Poli∣tick</HI> in such Men to <HI>let</HI> it cease; nor perhaps pos∣sible for them to <HI>make</HI> it cease, even if they were willing to do so. <HI>Riots, Tumults, Mutual Abuses, odious Nick-Names, Personal Affronts,</HI> are kept alive and warm, from <HI>Three</HI> Year to <HI>Three</HI> Year, by Men of Design and Dexterity in the Manage∣ment of other Men's <HI>Passions;</HI> improved and heighten'd by such <HI>quick Returns:</HI> These are what we see and feel of the <HI>Effects</HI> of it upon the Tem∣per of a Nation, that if ever it is ruined, can be ruined by nothing but its divided Affections and Interests.</P>
<P>Besides this, there could not be contrived a Method more effectual to the Debauchery of the Subject's <HI>Morals,</HI> not only in <HI>one,</HI> but in <HI>all,</HI> Re∣spects, than <HI>this</HI> hath proved. <HI>Bribery,</HI> known and open, (without a Remedy) which supposeth a Corruption of Mind, and naturally leads to an Insensibility to every thing Great and Honoura∣ble; and by Degrees, to a perfect Disregard to every thing Sacred and Useful. A Scene of Be∣stial Intemperance encouraged and paid for in many Places, for fear <HI>Friendship</HI> should cool, if it be not kept hot by such Methods.—And the Crimes that often accompany <HI>this,</HI> need not be mentioned. The least is a General Disposition in Men to leave the Thoughts of Diligence and In∣dustry in their Business, for the more agreeable Entertainments of Idleness, and a luxurious Beg∣gary.</P>
<P>I do not suppose or argue that this <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Term</HI> will put a full Stop to this Corruption of <HI>Morals,</HI> either as to <HI>Bribery,</HI> or to the other Instances named. But it is certain that the Re∣turns being not so quick, the Tempers of Men must, in the Nature of Things, become much more easy to one another by Degrees; which is itself an Advantage greatly to be valued. It is certain, that the <HI>Scent</HI> of <HI>Bribery</HI> cannot be so strong, nor the Avowal of it so constant, when there is such an Intermission. And, as for that never-ceasing Current of <HI>Debauchery,</HI> requisite for so frequent Elections, it must be this way inter∣rupted; and, in a good Degree, broken into. The Crimes often accompanying it must diminish: And the <HI>Men,</HI> brought up to laborious Callings, must exchange their <HI>Idleness</HI> for Industry; and be∣come much more useful to their Families and the <HI>Publick.</HI></P>
<P>I mention not the Ruin both of the Estates and Morals of <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> so frequently <HI>Candidates</HI> at our Elections: They know best how well they can bear such Evils; and whether it tends to make themselves better <HI>Patriots</HI> to their Country, or better Fathers to their own Families, that they are to make their Way by so quick Returns of <HI>Bribery</HI> and <HI>Corruption.</HI></P>
<P>We have hitherto considered the ill Effect of these evil Consequences at home, supposing them to terminate in the Concerns of <HI>Private</HI> Men. But this Supposition is not to be continued. For you will see presently, that all these Things have a visible Influence upon the <HI>Publick.</HI> The General <HI>Topick</HI> amongst the Adversaries of this <HI>Alteration,</HI> as well <HI>those</HI> who <HI>hate,</HI> as those who <HI>love, Liberty;</HI> truly so called, is, the <HI>seeming</HI> Advantage of this Part of the <HI>Act</HI> to that great and lovely Good. I call it <HI>seeming;</HI> because, as it never was designed at first, by many of the most zealous Promoters of it, for any thing but to <HI>cramp</HI> the Endeavours of a <HI>Good Prince,</HI> for the settling our <HI>Liberties:</HI> So it hath never had any better lasting Effect that Way, than they design'd it should have; but, as I think, visibly tends, in its Consequences, to the Destruction of our legal Liberties. The Reason is short and plain. Nothing in the World can make Men more supinely negligent of the Publick Interest, or dispose them more to receive their Chains, than a State of <HI>Bribery, Corruption, Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Idleness.</HI> And this is the constant State of most of our <HI>Electors,</HI> meerly thro' the quick Returns, and the pleasing Prospect of <HI>Electi∣ons.</HI> The more lasting and uninterrupted this <HI>State</HI> is, the less sensible are they of the <HI>Evils</HI> it inclines them to. They are by degrees brought to think the <HI>highest Bidder</HI> to have the best Right to their <HI>Votes.</HI> And will act in Time agreeably to that Thought, whether the <HI>Money</HI> be offer'd them from Abroad, or at Home. The little Interruption to their Vices and their Expectations, is the Thing which makes the Danger so great: And this is owing to the frequent Returns of <HI>Elections,</HI> at so short, certain, Periods of Time.</P>
<P>Nor doth this Argument touch the <HI>Electors</HI> only, but the <HI>Elected</HI> also, to a very great degree. For as long as Humane Nature is capable of <HI>Corruption;</HI> as long as there is a <HI>Probability,</HI> or even a <HI>Possibility,</HI> of any Part of Mankind being induced to sell their Country and their Posterity, for a present Advantage to themselves; so long it is evident to a Demonstration, that <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who have, by so frequent Returns of <HI>Chargeable Elections,</HI> exhausted their Estate, and impoverished their Families, will be much more likely to seek, or to embrace Op∣portunities of re-imbursing themselves, and pre∣venting their own immediate Ruin, at the Ex∣pence of the publick <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Security;</HI> much more likely I say, to act this Part, than if the <HI>Term</HI> were made longer; and if by that Means they might hope to be at rest from Expence for a much longer Time.</P>
<P>Add to this, that <HI>Personal</HI> and <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> which is, of all others, the most strong <HI>Principle</HI> in the Bulk of <HI>Men,</HI> never fails to actuate both the <HI>Candidates</HI> and the <HI>Electors.</HI> If ever our Ruin be effected, it is too probable <HI>this</HI> will be the great Engine of it. And let every one judge, whether any thing could be devised more likely, either to raise, or actuate, or preserve that Spirit in its Keenness and Bitterness, than the <HI>Triennial</HI> Returns of <HI>Elections,</HI> and the Expectation of them: Or whe∣ther any thing can give us any <HI>Respite</HI> from that Spirit, and its fatal Consequences, but an <HI>Altera∣tion</HI> of those <HI>Returns</HI> to a longer Distance.</P>
<P>There is another Consideration very well worth mentioning on this Subject, which is the Distri∣bution of Justice in the Countries: It is manifest, that nothing hath diverted the Course of it from its proper <HI>Current,</HI> so much as the <HI>Party-Views</HI> of Men, kept up to such a Degree by the expected Returns of <HI>frequent Elections;</HI> and that nothing can recall it again, but some Rest from those Views which turn'd it aside. Men will not have
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
the Temptation, and therefore not the Inclination, either to suspend Justice, or to act contrary to it, in many of those Instances, in which now their constant Hopes or Fears, actuated by the <HI>Frequency</HI> of <HI>Elections,</HI> are too apt to draw them aside. Be∣sides that, when some Intermission is given to the Heats and Quarrels of Neighbours, the Occasions and Opportunities of Partiality or Injustice, must, in good measure, cease.</P>
<P>The <HI>Effects</HI> which I have now gone over are but too certain, as they are the natural Product of the Passions of Men, in a divided Nation; and they are <HI>Evils,</HI> which will be, by degrees, at least very much abated by the present Design.</P>
<P>We have hitherto consider'd our <HI>Triennial Electi∣ons,</HI> their Influence upon <HI>Us</HI> at <HI>Home.</HI> Now, let us consider what Effect They have had, and still natu∣rally have, <HI>Abroad.</HI> And here it must be remembred, that We are a Nation, not separated in Interest (as We are in Situation) from the rest of <HI>Europe.</HI> We have Enemies at Home, acting in Concert with Enemies Abroad: And <HI>Friends</HI> Abroad, with∣out regard to whose Interests and Alliances, We must sooner or later, become a Sacrifice to those Enemies. We have a <HI>Pretender</HI> to guard against; Many here are his profess'd Friends; and many more act either blindly or designedly with Those who are so; bearing a sensible part in their In∣terests, and ever encouraging, or at least, not dis∣couraging, Them. That which keeps up the Views of those Abroad, who think it their Con∣cern, to make us the Scene of <HI>Civil War,</HI> if not a <HI>Province</HI> to themselves, under that <HI>Pretender; That,</HI> I say, alone, which keeps up their Views, is, the knowing They have <HI>Friends</HI> here; and the finding that these Friends are never in despair, but always representing their Cause, as promising well. And that which keeps them in this Temper, is, the constant Expectation of <HI>New Elections,</HI> in which They hope for more, but are certain at least, of <HI>this</HI> Advantage, that our Heats, and Hatreds, and Desire of Revenge, are still perpetuated and im∣proved. This is constantly represented abroad; and with such Success, that They who wish Evil to our Happy Establishment, seem really to believe it; and they who wish well to it, receive Impres∣sion enough from it, to look upon Us with Diffi∣dence, as a <HI>People,</HI> always fluctuating and uncer∣tain. It was this great disadvantage, arising from our Condition at home, that brought King <HI>William</HI> to make a <HI>Peace,</HI> even against his own good Judg∣ment, and his own great Views; for which no∣thing could be urged, but that distress, to which our wretched and uneasy State here, had reduced his Affairs. And no wonder now if after that great Unhappiness, and what is still more dreadful, after a late Fatal Experience, the best Friends we have <HI>A∣broad,</HI> cannot be so confident of us, as our Interest makes it requisite they should be. In a Word, Our <HI>Enemies</HI> both <HI>Abroad,</HI> and at <HI>Home,</HI> can't be reduc'd even one step towards a state of <HI>Despair,</HI> in the Methods We are in at present: Nor our best Friends be throughly assured of our secure Estate: The <HI>Former</HI> must look upon us still, with a good degree of Contempt; and the <HI>Latter</HI> with a great deal of Uneasiness and Diffidence, till We have some resting Time, to Settle, not only the <HI>Tempers,</HI> but the Affairs, and the Interests of this Nation: Which never will be done, as there is Reason to fear, as long as <HI>Parliaments</HI> continue limited to the present Term.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of another very material Point, which tho' absolutely necessary to procure Us the Confidence of our Friends, and to com∣mand Respect from our Enemies; yet seems im∣possible to be Effected without a greater steddiness of Counsels, a more uninterrupted Application to publick Business, and a more Mature and Disinte∣rested Deliberation, than the Experience we have had of frequent <HI>Elections</HI> gives room to hope for: This is the Paying off the <HI>Debts</HI> of the <HI>Nation,</HI> which must otherwise Eat out the very Vitals of the Publick, and expose Us to the greatest Dan∣ger from such foreign Powers, as are using the most violent Methods to be before hand with Us in this signal Advantage. To work out this inve∣terate Evil, there appears but one Method, consi∣stent with the Faith of Parliamentary Securities (which ought to be preserved inviolable) and at the same time, free from the Odium of imposing new Taxes on the Country, and in which con∣sequently the Landed, and the Monied Interest, would be likely to join, without eithers thinking themselves in the least aggrieved. This is to Raise and Support the Publick Credit to such a Height, as may enable the Government to Borrow, at a <HI>lower</HI> Interest, what may Pay off such Debts as carry a <HI>greater;</HI> which was attempted last Year, but hindred by the Rebellion. Now Experience shews, that publick Credit will be subject to per∣petual Fluctuations and Inequalities, or even fall to an Ebb from whence it is next to impossible to make it re-ascend, while the Measures of one three Years are liable to be Unravell'd and Reversed by the Three next succeeding, and those again by the next; and whilst under the Shelter of frequent Elections, such Tumults, Commotions and Disor∣ders, are Introduced, as, however opposite in themselves, conspire in shaking the Foundation of all Government, keep Mens Minds in suspence, and make them look on every Thing as precari∣ous, that is any ways involved with the Publick.</P>
<P>After many <HI>Enquiries,</HI> I can meet with but one <HI>Good Event,</HI> in favour of the <HI>Triennial Term</HI> for <HI>Elections,</HI> which a long Experience hath furnish'd us with: And that is, that it is suppos'd to have been the occasion of throwing out the Destructive <HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Commerce;</HI> some <HI>Gentlemen</HI> not daring to Vote for it out of fear, of their next <HI>Elections.</HI> But this you will see, cuts both ways. For, as <HI>Gentle∣men</HI> may by accident, not do a <HI>Bad</HI> thing for fear of their <HI>Next Election;</HI> so it is as plain, that they may, as often, not do the most necessary <HI>good</HI> thing, if it happens to be <HI>Unpopular,</HI> for the same fear. So that this holds at least equally <HI>against</HI> that Bill, as <HI>for</HI> it. But then many, who knew those Times, will deny the <HI>Fact,</HI> and affirm, that a multitude of <HI>little Piques,</HI> and <HI>great Passions,</HI> concurr'd in that Affair; and that the <HI>Awe</HI> of <HI>Electors,</HI> happen'd at that time to have but little Share in it. Private History would be useful to us upon this occasion. But <HI>this</HI> We all saw in <HI>publick,</HI> that however that Fear might then be suppos'd to work so far, as to hinder those few <HI>Gentlemen</HI> from openly espousing that <HI>fatal Bill;</HI> it did not work so far, as to keep them immedi∣ately from entering into an <HI>Address,</HI> and Voting for such <HI>Methods,</HI> as must have been as <HI>Fatal,</HI> as that Bill it self, if Providence had not interposed. What would it have avail'd us, that the <HI>Bill</HI> had not pass'd <HI>then,</HI> if these Designs, at the same Time on Foot, had prevail'd? And what doth it avail to say, that the <HI>Triennial Term</HI> did Us that good, (sup∣posing it so,) when it is plain, it had not the Power to preserve that Good; and that the same Persons, who seem'd to fear it, yet were induc'd to <HI>undo</HI> their own Work, and to enter into Mea∣sures, which must have ended in the same Evils,
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
and indeed, in Universal Destruction? It signi∣fies little, therefore, whether this was the great occasion of that <HI>lucky Incident</HI> or not; because it is plain it had not power enough to hinder the Ill Effects of that <HI>Bill,</HI> in another Me∣thod: Nor would have hindred them, had not something else intervened. But supposing it had; certainly <HI>that</HI> one particular, so purely acciden∣tal, cannot be set against a <HI>Train</HI> of Constant, and too certain, Evil Consequences, which we feel every Day we live. These <HI>Evil Consequences,</HI> are so many undeniable-Arguments for an <HI>Alteration</HI> of it; and weigh exceedingly and particularly at this Juncture, when all our Happiness depends upon the <HI>Firm Establishment</HI> of our <HI>Excellent King,</HI> upon this Throne; when all our Enemies at Home and Abroad, visibly place their Hopes in our Disturbances, owing to nothing so much as to the constant Expectation of <HI>Triennial Elections;</HI> when all our true Friends, both here and else∣where, wait with Impatience to see our Securi∣ty firmly and throughly Established: When the going on with proper Measures, for such Esta∣blishment, has been unavoidably put off, by the Attention given to the Rebellion, and so the longer Continuance of this Parliament is become particularly necessary; And when We all may observe, if We please, that, tho' the <HI>Rebellion</HI> be in great Measure quell'd, yet, the <HI>Spirit</HI> of it, is so far from being lay'd asleep, that it walks about still, even at Noon-day, in defiance of all <HI>Authority;</HI> and with a strubborness, never to be re∣duced to a settled Despair, without some such <HI>Me∣thod,</HI> as is now talk'd of.</P>
<P>These <HI>Particulars,</HI> I say, are so many undeniable Arguments, for an <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Years</HI> fix'd in the <HI>Act,</HI> unless it shall appear that the <HI>Objections</HI> against doing it, are of more Weight and Importance. Those which I have been able to hear of, together with such as you tell me are most talk'd of in the Country, We will now just run over.</P>
<P>The most general Objection (and that which seems in reality to lye at the Bottom of all the rest) is, that this Step will be so un∣popular among the Electors, and raise such a Cla∣mour all over the Nation, as must for ever sink the Interest of those who have any Share in pro∣moting it. To this I answer, that it will wholly depend on the Parliament it self, to render this proceeding Popular, or Unpopular, by the right or wrong Use they shall make of the Prolongation thereby accruing to themselves. If their After-behaviour should be such, as to shew they had no wiser, nor more generous View in making this Alteration, than merely to save themselves the hazard, trouble and expence of a New Election, they must, no doubt, be content to reap the Re∣wards of their Selfishness, by forfeiting all Title to the future good Will of their Electors. But if their Zeal and Industry for promoting the Ease and Safety of the Nation, shall appear to rise in proportion to the Time allowed them for accom∣plishing the great Work they have begun, the <HI>End</HI> will sufficiently commend the <HI>Means;</HI> and the Ad∣vantages arising to the whole Kingdom from this Change, will easily Reconcile it to all such, with whom a good Man ought ever to wish to Maintain the Character of Popularity. It will certainly be in the Power of those who most apprehend the Odi∣um, and Unpopularity of this Action, to Secure it from all possible Mis-representations, by making Use of the Power it will bring with it, to just and wise Purposes; to ease the Debts, to perfect the Tranquility, and to perpetuate the Peace of the Nation. Raising Money by <HI>Taxes</HI> upon <HI>Land,</HI> Windows, Soap, or any thing else, is always <HI>Unpopular,</HI> and always raises <HI>Clamours,</HI> when it is first resolved upon. Every thing that hath been done for the Security of His present <HI>Majesty;</HI> the suspending the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> without which We must have been destroyed; the grant∣ing Him a Power to Raise, and Hire, Forces for his own, and the Nation's Defence; the putting his <HI>Friends</HI> into any Possibility of consulting his Safety and Honour; Every particular of this sort hath been represented all over the Nation, in such Colours, that it hath been highly <HI>unpopular,</HI> and been attended with great <HI>Clamours:</HI> But Necessity and Ex∣pedience are the things to be consider'd in all such Points. <HI>These</HI> will always make things <HI>pleasing</HI> to the true Friends of the Nation. But in order to be <HI>popular</HI> with the <HI>King's</HI> Enemies, the first Step he must take, must be, to lay down his <HI>Crown;</HI> and if his <HI>Ministers</HI> be resolved to be moved by <HI>Cla∣mours,</HI> they must resign their <HI>Posts,</HI> and yield up all Power to those who wish to destroy them. The only Consideration is, whether the Nation's Affairs require a thing to be done: When <HI>that</HI> is fix'd, <HI>Popular</HI> or <HI>Unpopular, Clamours</HI> or <HI>no Clamours,</HI> ought not to affect any farther, than about the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it. Every thing that touches particular Men's Purses, or retrenches from their Luxury, will generally be <HI>Unpopular</HI> with those Men: But a little Time makes such things easy, when the <HI>Publick</HI> finds it's Advantage in it, and Men's Passions have had Time to cool.</P>
<P>Another thing which I find generally shews it self, at first hearing of the <HI>Design,</HI> is, an <HI>Uneasiness,</HI> as if <HI>this</HI> were <HI>Repealing the Act:</HI> When, in truth, I will venture to affirm, that it is so far from <HI>that,</HI> that it is indeed Restoring it to its best Design; and making it effectual to all that Good which was originally purposed, and intended, by any of those <HI>honest Patriots</HI> who joined in the first framing of it. The Designs were, that a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> should not be <HI>without</HI> a <HI>Parliament;</HI> and that <HI>one</HI> and the same <HI>Parliament</HI> should have a <HI>Term</HI> fixed, beyond which it should not be in the Power of the <HI>Prince</HI> to continue it. And in both these respects the <HI>Act</HI> will be left as it was. All the Difference is, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> then in being, thought <HI>Three Years</HI> the proper Term. Experience hath assured us of a Multitude of Evils proceeding from so quick a <HI>Return</HI> of <HI>Elections.</HI> And therefore, in that part of the <HI>Act,</HI> and in <HI>that</HI> only, is the <HI>Alteration</HI> in∣tended, in order to remedy or abate those <HI>Evils,</HI> without bringing in greater.</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> Reason against it, is taken from a Sus∣picion of some private and personal Views in the <HI>King's Ministers;</HI> as if the whole Aim were to establish themselves, for so much longer time, in their Power. But I observe, that the same Persons who make this <HI>Objection,</HI> generally contradict it, by affirming that the <HI>Ministers</HI> have nothing to fear, and that this present Design is wholly <HI>unnecessary,</HI> because a Court may be sure of another <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons,</HI> to their Mind. They must think the <HI>Ministry</HI> very weak, not to see this, which is so plain, that the Influence of a <HI>Court</HI> hath hardly ever fail'd in this Point, tho' at the same time, the Gentlemen who make this Objection, are apt to insinuate the necessity of some Measures for this purpose, which cannot be very agreeable to an honest and incorrupt Ministry. However, in the Opinion of such as allow this, it cannot be having a View to <HI>Themselves,</HI> but a general View to the <HI>Nation</HI> at <HI>Home,</HI> and to the Interest and
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Glory of it <HI>Abroad,</HI> which engageth the Ministers in this Design. They who know the Nature of such Affairs, judge the contrary, that <HI>Ministers,</HI> as to their own private Interest, might more proba∣bly find their Account in <HI>New Parliaments,</HI> than in <HI>One continued.</HI> Experience shews, that the most <HI>Courtly Parliaments</HI> have turn'd <HI>Uncourtly</HI> in their long sitting. And therefore, this Design can't be necessary for any private self-interested Views of their own, because it is allowed, that such Ends, (if they have any,) might be serv'd as well, at least, in the former Method, as in this. They, who find a <HI>Biass</HI> in their Minds, against every thing pro∣posed by a <HI>Court,</HI> let it be what it will, should consider, in this Case, whether it be not probable that the present Views and Designs are of a <HI>Publick Nature,</HI> rather than of a <HI>Private;</HI> and should act accordingly, without prejudice, or affection, as they think it requisite, or not, for the Establish∣ment of the <HI>King,</HI> and the <HI>Nation;</HI> and for the more effectual destroying all the Hopes of the Enemies of both.</P>
<P>The most powerful <HI>Objection</HI> of all, is, that the <HI>Alteration</HI> now design'd, may make it much more likely, that under a <HI>Bad Prince,</HI> sometime or other, <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought in. For the pre∣sent, I am sure, we have nothing to fear. We have now a <HI>King</HI> upon the <HI>Throne,</HI> whose <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/></HI> is fashioned to <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Justice;</HI> and whose great en∣quiry upon all Occasions is, what our Consti∣tution and what our Laws require of <HI>Him.</HI> We have a <HI>Prince,</HI> in View, to succeed Him, whose <HI>Native Honour</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> guard Him against all suspicion. But I grant, this may not always be our Happiness, either in <HI>Possession,</HI> or in <HI>Prospect.</HI> And therefore if this <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eration</HI> could be proved, I should be moved another way, than I am at pre∣sent: There will be more
<HI>Time,</HI> I acknowledge, in any one particular <HI>Parliament,</HI> for <HI>Attempts</HI> to be made that way. But, as I think, not at all more likely to succeed. On the contrary, there is more likelihood, that <HI>Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> should by degrees, be∣come even ready to part with a Constitution, for which there must be such Contention by <HI>Bribery,</HI> and all the <HI>Arts</HI> of Iniquity, every <HI>Three Years,</HI> than if it were otherwise. And then again, supposing a <HI>Parliament</HI> chosen for <HI>Three Years</HI> only; a <HI>Prince</HI> resolutely bent upon doing it in a <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liamentary</HI> way, prepared with Treasures and Favours, might make such Attempts, before that <HI>Term</HI> be expired, that none could resist, who would not as certainly go on farther in their Integrity. One may venture to affirm, that a <HI>Parliament</HI> which keeps its Integri∣ty for <HI>Three Years,</HI> will discourage the making any such Attempts for the remaining <HI>Four.</HI> And, to give an Instance, if I remember right, the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI> which gave up the <HI>Liberties</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> gave that Fatal stroke within the <HI>Term</HI> of <HI>Three Years</HI>▪ Whenever a <HI>Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> can be bad enough for such a Design, they will first take care, at the time of Election, to set up Persons capable of the same bad Design. And then, there is no difference be∣tween <HI>Three</HI> or <HI>Seven Years.</HI> Only, here remem∣ber, what I have before observ'd to you, that the quick Returns of <HI>Trienn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Elections.</HI> tend much more, to that <HI>Corruption, Bribery,</HI> Dissoluteness of Manners, as well as <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> which pave the way to the loss of <HI>Liberty,</HI> than the <HI>longer Term,</HI> now proposed, can do. One might appeal to any who know the World, whether it be not more probable (as I have urged already,) that the <HI>Elected Gentlemen</HI> themselves, impoverish'd by so frequent Returns of their great <HI>Charges,</HI> will be inclined to listen to the Offer made them, with so pernici∣ous a View, than if the Returns were not so fre∣quent; and besides this, whether the Influence that way, from the powerful motive of <HI>Party-Revenge,</HI> will not have vastly more weight, when it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> roused and irritated, and set on Fire, by so quick <HI>Returns</HI> of <HI>Contention,</HI> than if it were otherwise. And, what is of great moment, in my opinion, since it is plain that every Instance of wickedness, and di∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, tending to destruction, is so heighten'd and infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med by the quick <HI>Returns</HI> of <HI>Elections;</HI> there must be much greater Encouragement to a <HI>Foreign Enemy,</HI> to interpose with his Money, to purchase our Ruine, in a <HI>Triennial Choice,</HI> than in a <HI>Septennial.</HI> Especially now, before we are well settled upon that Bottom which is the only Foundation of our Happiness. It is well known how far the Neigh∣bouring Powers intermeddle in the Elections of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> and with how much success they send their Agents and Factors to them; and what an abuse of Liberty this Corruption has in∣troduced in those Countries, all the World can testify: Nor can we think the Election of a British Parliament, so very indifferent a thing to some neighbouring Powers, especially, at certain Jun∣ctures, that they should think One or Two Hun∣dred Thousand Pounds misapplied, in purchasing Votes to their Mind. And I can say, that this is no whimsical Supposition, because I have my self seen an <HI>Intercepted Letter,</HI> written from hence in∣to <HI>France,</HI> just before the last <HI>Election,</HI> by a Friend to the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who had taken the <HI>Oaths</HI> to King <HI>George,</HI> plainly hinting both that such a thing was then expected from the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that he did not doubt the <HI>Success</HI> of it. I think, this alone is enough to allarm any true Lover of his Country, in the present Situation of our Affairs, and of those of all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is one more <HI>Objection,</HI> I hear, is often urged, That <HI>We</HI> should have severely blamed such a De∣sign in the late <HI>Administration:</HI> Nay, that great Horror was express'd, at the very supposition of the thing, at that time; I grant this, and that the Horror was just and reasonable. But upon what was this founded? Not upon the unlawfulness of the thing it self; not upon the Impossibility of it's ever being fit to be done; but upon a too well∣grounded Assurance, that they who were then in Power must have meant it, whenever they did it, for the same end, to which their other Acts tended, and that was, the utter Ruine of the <HI>Grand-Alli∣ance,</HI> and of all the Hopes of our best <HI>Friends</HI> Abroad, and the inspiring full Vigour into the Cause of <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Pretender.</HI> This was the Ground of all just dread upon that Head. Had it been so, that they had design'd it manifestly for the firmer Security of the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> here, and the greater support of the <HI>Grand Alliance</HI> abroad, no true <HI>Britain</HI> could have had ground of Complaint, but must have acknowledg'd, if it tended, and was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>essary to so good ends, that it was not on∣ly lawfull, but highly praise-worthy. An In∣stance parallel to it may quite take off the Edg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this <HI>Objection.</HI> What honest Mind would not have been filled with <HI>Uneasiness</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> sup∣posing <HI>They</HI> had then attmpted to suspend the <HI>Habeas Corpus Act,</HI> by which they might have confined all Men of great Capacity and Influence, whom they knew to be averse to their Proceedings, in favour of <HI>France?</HI> But would this have been any Argument, why the Friends of King <HI>George</HI> should not have secured <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>the Nation</HI> by such a <HI>Suspension,</HI> when made necessary by the Treasonable Practices of his avowed Enemies? Or because we blame a thing,

lawful in it self, when we see it design'd for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; therefore, must we be averse to a <HI>lawful</HI> thing, design'd, and tending to our <HI>Preservation?</HI> This is the whole strength of that <HI>Objection,</HI> which yet, I believe, weighs with many, for want of considering it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>late Ministers,</HI> I verily believe they de∣sign'd no such thing. And my reason for believing so, is, that they did not at all want it; nay, that it would have done them more Hurt than Good. Their Designs were such as were to be manag'd solely by Artifice. The great <HI>Engines</HI> they made use of for keeping up a Spirit, against all Truth and Right, were those very <HI>Mobbs, Riots,</HI> and <HI>Tu∣mults,</HI> which alone could keep a Multitude in such a Ferment, as to make them admire, and press for their own Ruine. They thought it their Interest to govern by the <HI>Passions</HI> of the Crowd: And were very peculiarly dextrous in the Management of them. They were possess'd of the full Cry, and Noise of the Nation, and likely, in all probability, so to continue: This was a much surer Hold to <HI>Them,</HI> and to <HI>their</HI> Designs, than the Continuance of One and the same <HI>Parliament:</HI> And therefore, they never attempted it. But certainly, as that same Spirit, which was then raised for the Service of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> made it <HI>unnecessary</HI> for <HI>them;</HI> so, it being still alive, and full of evil Influences upon our Happiness, this makes it highly prudent in <HI>Others,</HI> to do <HI>that</HI> in order to suppress and extir∣pate it, which <HI>They,</HI> in their Wisdom, would not do, for fear of quieting what they expected Bene∣fit from. <HI>Their</HI> security consisted in keeping up that vile Spirit to the Heighth. It is the security of the <HI>King</HI> and his Government, to have a stop put to it, and to remove every Opportunity that may give <HI>Fuel</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> to it, as far as is consistent with the Constitution and Liberties of the Nation.</P>
<P>All these <HI>Considerations</HI> put together, have, I con∣fess, wholly taken off my <HI>First Surprize.</HI> And the same Considerations make me hope, that all true Friends to the <HI>King,</HI> and to the <HI>Publick Happiness,</HI> (which now depends entirely upon the firm <HI>Esta∣blishment</HI> of the present Royal Family) will not let their <HI>General Suspicion,</HI> or their <HI>Particular Biass,</HI> have such Power over them, as to move them, to join with their own <HI>Enemies,</HI> in a <HI>Point,</HI> in which if they should, by any unforeseen Accident, have <HI>Success,</HI> I am confident, they would very heartily, as well as fruitlesly <HI>repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> of their own Proceed∣ings. When Persons who have always shewn themselves <HI>Enemies</HI> to Liberty, and Professors of the <HI>Principles</HI> of Slavery; who have ever ex∣press'd a Hatred of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and of every thing built upon it; and have ever been the Sup∣ports of the <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Interest in these Nations: When such, I say, put on a Zeal for <HI>Li∣berty,</HI> it is a Moral Demonstration that it is all a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck-Shew;</HI> and that they themselves think quite otherwise of what they oppose, than they would seem to think. If it were really their Opinion, that the <HI>Alteration</HI> now proposed, would either help the <HI>Cause</HI> which they have espoused, or be any Prejudice to a <HI>Government</HI> which they hate, I am very confident, they would not enter into the <HI>Opposition</HI> of it, with that <HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> which they now profess. But they foresee that their <HI>Hopes</HI> must in Proportion abate, with those <HI>Heats</HI> and <HI>Disturbances</HI> which alone keep them alive; and for this Reason it is, that they now take into their Mouths the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>rds</HI> and <HI>Topicks</HI> which they have ever hitherto ridiculed and exploded; in order to keep off the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng</HI> which they heartily hate, <HI>the Settle∣ment of the present Government in Peace and Quiet at Home, and in Honour and Glory Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>And this is one very good Reason, why <HI>All,</HI> who truly wish well to that <HI>Settlement,</HI> should unite in the <HI>Alteration</HI> of that which is the <HI>Chief,</HI> if not the <HI>Only,</HI> thing left to keep up the Spirits and Designs of its Enemies. But if, when it is in our Power, to put some Stop to our present <HI>Corruptions</HI> and <HI>Di∣stractions,</HI> and to establish the <HI>Glory</HI> of our <HI>King,</HI> and the Happiness of our Country, in a Method per∣fectly confident with all our Rights and Liberties, we are guided by the Insinuations of those who hate us, and refuse to do it, we must thank our selves for all that follows. It will lie at our Door to answer for all the Consequences of such a Neg∣lect. From <HI>these,</HI> with whom we join in it, we have no Returns to expect, but Contempt, Re∣proaches, and Insults.</P>
<P>In fine, I can consider the <HI>Triennial Return</HI> of our <HI>Elections,</HI> no otherwise, than as what hath made us, and still continues us, the most Divided and most Corrupted of <HI>Nations;</HI> what was at first by many contrived, and still in its own Nature tends to oppose the Designs of the <HI>Best Kings,</HI> and to promote those of the <HI>Worst;</HI> leading to an universal Debauchery of the Manners and Tempers of the <HI>Electors,</HI> as well as to make the <HI>Elected</HI> themselves weary enough of such perpetual Contests and Charge, to incline some Time or other to <HI>Thoughts</HI> which would not otherwise find Admittance; in∣fluencing the <HI>People</HI> to think easily of becoming a Prey to the <HI>Highest Bidder;</HI> keeping up the <HI>Spirits</HI> of our <HI>Common Enemies,</HI> and creating Diffidence and Uneasiness in our <HI>best Friends;</HI> introducing and in∣creasing all Excesses of Violence and Mutual Re∣venge; serving a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>bad</HI> Purposes, which have a peculiar Malignity at this particular Jun∣cture, without having <HI>one</HI> good Effect, fit to be named in Opposition to them: And all this occa∣sioned by the <HI>Shortness</HI> of the <HI>Interval</HI> allowed, ei∣ther to put an End to such Evils, or to cultivate any thing that is Good. To cure all these entire∣ly, nothing can perhaps be thought of, but what would introduce greater. To apply something that may put an <HI>End</HI> to <HI>some</HI> of them, and abate and diminish the rest, is a Matter that deserves the Regard of every good <HI>Briton.</HI> And, I believe, at this Time nothing at all effectual can be thought of, without an <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>Triennial Elections.</HI> I am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
