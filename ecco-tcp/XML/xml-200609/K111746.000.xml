<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is more usual for Poets, than for Writers
of any other description, to apologize for present∣ing
their Works to the Publick. It is not easy to de∣termine,
whether this arises from a suspicion that their
Talents are unequal to support the Character they have
assumed, or whether it proceeds from an idea, that
(as of Poetical Merit all the world <HI>are,</HI> or <HI>pretend</HI> to
be, Judges) the utmost appearance of diffidence is ne∣cessary
to defend the Candidates for the Laurel from
the Vengeance of Criticism. The Man who publishes
a Treatise in Theology, or an Essay on Farriery, comes
<PB N="ii" REF="10"/>
boldly forward, and delivers his opinion without ap∣parent
apprehensions. But such is not the case with
the Poet; he generally thinks himself obliged to state,
<Q REND="inline">"that the following Poems were never intended for
the Public Eye—that they were written for the
entertainment of a select Circle, or (how felfish!)
merely to amuse himself—that either the earnest
intreaties of friends, or a dread lest their zeal
might have tempted them to circulate incorrect
copies of his works, are his sole motives for
appealing to the Tribunal of Public Criticism."</Q>—Such is the general Prelude to Poems. But the
Author of this Volume is much at a loss how he
may properly deprecate the Public Vengeance, for
having aspired to the title of a Poet; as he confessedly
comes forward, neither urged by the intreaties of
Friends, nor terrified by the threats of Creditors; and
he certainly entertains no apprehensions that his slen∣der
stock of Fame may be injured by the publication
of spurious Copies, for none such exist.—He has there∣fore
<PB N="iii" REF="11"/>
nothing to plead in his own excuse, but that the
Publick having without disgust received his humble
attempts in Prose, he is encouraged by the Protection
he has already experienced, to appear once more as
an Author, hoping, that those whom he may fail to
please, will pardon his having attempted it.</P>
<P>To many the Perusal of these Trifles will restore
the recollection of times long past. They will be re∣membered
with pleasure, though mingled with that re∣gret
which ever attends the recollection of happy days
that are to return no more.</P>
<P>In extenuation of any Errors that may occur in
these Poems, the Author has only to say, that they
were mostly written from the age of Seventeen (when
he commenced his Literary Career) to Twenty-four;
that at that time of life the Imagination is more
active than the Judgement; and that at present
he is so reduced by a long and tedious illness, as to
<PB N="iv" REF="12"/>
be incapable of improving whatever he has written.
For the last four years of his life, those hours that
have not been marked with disease have been devoted
to studies of a severer nature, in order to qualify him
for the practice of a profession, which a Constitution
debilitated by disease obliges him now, for ever, to
relinquish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had it pleased the all-wise Disposer of all events to have spared Mr. B's life, he hoped to have obtained some appoint∣ment in the Diplomatic line, for which, as well as for the Bar, nature and education had excellently qualified him. Mr. B. never had, at any moment of his life, an idea of going into the Ministry—he saying to his friend about a month before his death, <Q REND="inline">"Nothing <HI>this</HI> world has to offer could ever in∣duce me to go into orders whilst it pleases GOD to spare me my understanding."</Q> Mr. B. had from early youth been <HI>in∣treated</HI> to read with deep attention the thirty-third chapter of the Prophet Ezekiel, and St. Paul's Epistles to Timothy and Titus; and Mr. B. firmly believed, that <Q REND="inline">"ALL Scripture was given by inspiration."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From a mind exhausted by pain and sickness, ema∣nations
of splendor cannot be expected. Had the
<PB N="v" REF="13"/>
Author still possessed that share of health, which once
constituted his first felicity, he might have rendered
his performances less deserving of censure: but, what∣ever
be the result of their publication, the writing of
them has occupied many an hour that might have
been worse employed; and he may add, that his
having a Literary turn of mind has procured him the
acquaintance and friendship of many, whose superio∣rity
of Talents he readily acknowledges, and from
whose Conversation he has derived at once Pleasure
and Instruction. Neither has an Attachment to Poe∣try,
as is too often the case, prevented his pursuing
Studies of a different cast. From the Works of his
Friend Doctor Reid (and those of other able Writers
in the same line), he has derived a pleasure more so∣lid
than Poetry can bestow. Poetry may charm with
the power of Fancy; but it is Philosophy alone that
can strengthen the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="14"/>
As the Author's present state of health renders it
probable that this may be his last Address to the
Publick, he will not lay down his pen without ad∣verting
to the Reviews. Those Channels of Literary
Intelligence are often censured, as both partial and
severe. How far these charges may be just, he will
not pretend to determine: but he wishes those who
bring the charge to recollect, that Reviewers are
men; that some degree of partiality is inseparable
from humanity; and that therefore, till we are sup∣plied
with Reviews from above, they, like every other
human invention, must have their imperfections.
However, in matters of Religion, the Reviewers may
have improper biasses; in matters of Belles Lettres,
their opinion will in general be found to be impartial,
and by appeals from their decision little is now to be
gained. We live in an age when Literary Merit is
throughly understood; and the Volumes that are
now condemned, will derive little advantage from the
award of Posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="15"/>
Having said thus much on the subject of the Re∣views,
he thinks it right to declare, that he has not
the least personal acquaintance with any of the Gentle∣men
who compile them. Of his connections with
the Reviewers, in his literary capacity, he has no
right to complain. Where he has merited censure,
they have inflicted it fairly; and they have often
cheered him with approbation.</P>
<P>Whatever be the result of their Decision with re∣spect
to this Work, he promises to submit without
any appeal. With respect to the Trifles that com∣pose
this Volume, he has only farther to observe, that,
instead of inscribing the whole to one person, he has
inscribed the separate Poems to different people, as
slight tokens of his esteem. For this mode of Dedi∣cation,
though now he does not think himself bound
to offer any apology, possibly his plan may recall
to the memory of his Readers the fable of the Hare
and many Friends; and should the Author fail of
<PB N="viii" REF="16"/>
success in his present attempt, he, like the Hare, may
experience the inutility of Friendship. But, what∣ever
be the success of his Volume, he will still have
the satisfaction to reflect, that he has never written a
line, which,
<Q>"dying, he might wish to blot."</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF MR. MONCK BERKELEY;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESENT
TIME.</BYLINE>
<P>MY first knowledge of Mr. Berkeley was at Oxford.
He was then a Gentleman Commoner of Magdalen Hall in
that University; and though many very respectable names
were at the same time on the list of its members, yet Mr.
Berkeley was so pre-eminently noble in his manners, so
faithful in his friendships, and so benevolent to his asso∣ciates,
that perhaps not one of the society envied his high
reputation as a man, or thought themseves lessened by the
acknowledged superiority of his talents as a scholar. His
delight was in searching out merit; and, well knowing that
it fled from the glare of day, and should be sought after in
the shade of retirement, he there looked for that humble,
but valuable plant, and, having found it, transplanted it in∣stantly
into the richest soil he had access to. The soul of
the great Bishop Berkeley seemed in every thing to have
<PB N="xiv" REF="21"/>
animated the body of his Grandson, and, like him, to have
equally deserved the just tribute of praise recorded by the
sweet Poet of his day:
<Q>"To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven."</Q></P>
<P>Genius marked him in his earliest years for a child of her
own adoption; and had not Providence, for some good pur∣pose,
hidden from our eyes, recalled his spirit from the
abodes of men, when it was verging upon the years where
youth ends and manhood begins, he would not have needed
the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he
possessed every power,
<Q><L>"Whether, by various rules of art,</L>
<L>"To touch the soul, or warm the heart;</L>
<L>"To please the eye, delight the mind,</L>
<L>"With objects simple, pure, refin'd:</L>
<L>"To sound sublime the epic strain,</L>
<L>"Like Falccus charm, or with the rage</L>
<L>"Of Juvenal, chastise the age;</L>
<L>"Sweet as the prophet's vision to unfold</L>
<L>"What sainted breasts have felt, but never told:</L>
<L>"What Bards to us with sparing hand have given,</L>
<L>"Of lib'ral gifts bestow'd on them by Heaven."</L><BIBL>WEBB.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="22"/>Through a long and oppressive illness, he supported with
unabated vigour the soul of the Christian, the ties of friend∣ship,
and the benevolence of the man. Pious without of∣tentation,
gay without licentiousness, a poet without envy,
a man without guile. Such was George Monck Berkeley,
Esq. now happier far in the region of his kindred spirits,
than all the vain pursuits of this earthly globe could bestow
upon him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to offer to your Lordship the
following hasty sketch of the (alas) <HI>short</HI> life of a most accom∣plished

amiable attention, when introduced to your Lordship by
letter only, from an old acquaintance, of whom perhaps
<Q REND="inline">"you had not heard even the name for near a quarter of

<P>It requires an abler pen than that of a poor infirm

happy Mother's gratitude <HI>for</HI> those <HI>attentions.</HI> By those
who have known her best through life, GRATITUDE has been
said to be the distinguishing, the strongest feature in her
character, and she is tempted to believe it; for the death
<PB N="xviii" REF="24"/>
of her angelic-hearted Son certainly blasted every <HI>other</HI> pas∣sion
of her mind. But gratitude, perhaps indigenous, if
any good in our fallen nature may be said to be so, still
blossoms in her heart. No affliction has eradicated, has
blasted, or frozen it. Whilst it continues sensible to any
sublunary objects, it will reflect with pleasure, with delight,
often with extacy, on the goodness of your Lordship, and
your incomparable compeer, the excellent Earl of Leven,
to the descendant of those two great and good Men, Bishop
Berkeley and Francis Cherry, Esquire, and the happiness
thereby conferred on her who has the honour to be, with
the sincerest gratitude,</P>

<P>GEORGE-MONCK BERKELEY, Esquire, LL.B. and
F.S.S.A. was the eldest, and, during the last eighteen
years of his life, the only child of the Reverend GEORGE
BERKELEY, LL.D. Prebendary of Canterbury (son of
George Lord Bishop of Cloyne by Anne eldest daughter of
the Right Honourable John Forster, Speaker of the House
of Commons in Ireland) and Eliza eldest daughter of the
Reverend Henry Frinsham, M.A. (by Eliza youngest daugh∣ter
and co-heiress of Francis Cherry, Esquire, of Shottesbrook
House in the county of Berks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A friend of Mr. Berkeley used to tell him, that he was as remarkably de∣scended by his Mother, as he was nobly by his Father. Two of Mrs. Berke∣ley's paternal grandsires were killed in one day at the Isle of Rhée. Sir John Heidon and Sir George Blundell, Baronets; and the son of the former was highly favoured by Providence to <HI>escape</HI> an untimely death, by the wretched Lord Bruce's objecting to <HI>his</HI> being second in that tremendous duel fought be∣tween him and Sir Edward Sackville, ancestor to the present worthy Duke of Dorset. Some years ago, when Mr. Berkeley visited France, and got a letter of introduction to his Grace, then Ambassador at Paris, containing a very ur∣gent request that Mr. Berkeley might have particular attention, his Father, laughing, said, <Q REND="inline">"You may plead your grandsire's <HI>merits</HI> in crossing the ocean to prevent his Grace's grandsire's being <HI>butchered</HI> by that <HI>wretch</HI> Lord Bruce."</Q> All who have read that tragical tale related by Mr. Addison in "The Guardian," and in the second volume of Collin's Peerage, p. 196, must rejoice that poor Lord Bruce died possessed of a very different spirit from that which influenced him in life; that he, like the thief on the cross, was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half, or rather <HI>three quarters,</HI> just before the <HI>final</HI> close of the day of MERCY and GRACE; for his soul passed into the region of spirits within the hour.</NOTE>).</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="28"/>
Mr. Berkeley was born at Bray, in the county of Berks,
on Tuesday, February 8, 1763, at half past two in the
morning.</P>
<P>It is frequently said by Biographers, that nothing re∣markable
occurred during childhood. Of Mr. Berkeley this
cannot be asserted; for, throughout childhood, youth, man∣hood,
and till within a <HI>very</HI> few months of his death, the
hair-breadth escapes of losing life were almost innumera∣ble;
an all-gracious Providence constantly interposing, some∣times
very remarkably, to rescue him from death, until he
was enabled, by free Sovereign Grace, through Redeeming
Mercy, to meet that King of Terrors with joy; for he died
triumphing in Christ.</P>
<P>A little before the birth of Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Cadogan's
"Essay on the Nursing of Children" made its appearance,
when the depositing children in cradles was exploded; ac∣cordingly
a large easy chair during the day was appropriated
to his use. When he was about six weeks old, a person
going into the nursery in the dusk, before the servant had
lighted candles, sat down on this chair; but providentially
did not sit quite to the back, it being very deep. She soon
<PB N="xxi" REF="29"/>
felt something move; the infant, finding itself incommoded,
began to struggle with its arms and legs. Mr. Berkeley,
from his birth, shewed the very uncommon strength of
limbs, which, as he grew up, increased; and he was
esteemed the strongest man in England, by those who were
judges. Some of his intimate friends have owed their lives,
in a tumultuous crowd, to the strength of his arm, joined
to his true resolute cool courage, where he did not wish to
have recourse to his sword. Mr. Berkeley's strength was
muscular, as his bones were remarkably small; his wrist,
some time before his death, measuring little more than six
inches.</P>
<P>When he was about three months old, his mother was
attacked by so desperate an ague, that it was supposed ano∣ther
fit must have proved fatal to her; yet so unwilling was
she, that her darling, her idol (alas) from his cradle to his
coffin, should be indebted for his early nourishment to any
but herself, that she resolved to attempt the bringing him
up by hand; but he had very nearly lost his life in the at∣tempt,
before a nurse could be procured.</P>
<P>At a very early period of his life he began to shew signs
of that uncommon brilliancy of parts, quickness of wit, and
soundness of judgement, which so remarkably distinguished
him through life, even to its latest period. To relate wit∣ticisms
of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridicu∣lous;
<PB N="xxii" REF="30"/>
one or two instances, it is hoped, may, however,
be pardoned. When about three years old, he was searching
the house for his mother, whom from his earliest infan∣cy,
he passionately loved. Unable to find her, he walked
from room to room, calling her. A lady, who was staying
in the family, said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child, what a bleating thou
dost make!"</Q> He instantly turned round, and said, <Q REND="inline">"To
be sure I do, for I am <HI>bleating for my Dam.</HI>"</Q> When he
was little more than three years and a half old, he was di∣verting
himself in the garden. A beggar came to the gate,
and, seeing the hall doors and windows all open, and no
one in sight, said, <Q REND="inline">"My pretty little Master, what are you
doing here alone?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am watering some
flowers for the gardener."</Q> The old fox said, <Q REND="inline">"I think I
must come in and help you;"</Q> on which Mr. Berkeley
flew to the gate, and bolted it, saying, <Q REND="inline">"No, I thank you,
I can do it very well by myself."</Q> On his maid's asking
him why he bolted the gate, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, if he had
got into the house now that the men are out with the
coach, perhaps the maids and I could not have got him out
again."</Q></P>
<P>Generosity and compassion are indeed very rarely found
until instilled into the breasts of very young children: in
Mr. Berkeley they were certainly indigenous. When a
child in arms, if he was asked to give a piece of cake out
of his hand, he would instantly break off three-fourths of it,
<PB N="xxiii" REF="31"/>
reserving only a very small piece for himself, and be un∣happy
if the petitioner did not take and eat it. On re∣ceiving
his orange after dinner, when it was peeled, he
would retire to the window ahd carefully separate the quills,
then go out into the servants' hall, and force one upon
every servant, eight in number. One evening his mother
observing that he kept his left hand closed, enquired whe∣ther
he had hurt it; the servant replied, that he had not,
but that he had kept since dinner, full four hours, a quill
of his orange to give to the coachman, who had been sent
to Windsor on a message, and that no promises of care
could prevail on Master Berkeley to entrust her with it,
adding, that he assured her, <Q REND="inline">"it would <HI>comfort</HI> him after
his ride."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley had been told, as all children should be,
that the poor had a right to a share of all his money; ac∣cordingly,
the first bright sixpence of which he was master,
he procured a hammer, and attempted to break it. On his
servant's asking him what he was about, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why
Mamma says, the poor must have their share of it, so I
am going to break it for them."</Q> This attended him to
his latest hour; for the distressed ever shared largely indeed
in every guinea he possessed.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's understanding was such as often, when a
child, to occasion his Mother to say, she hoped he would
<PB N="xxiv" REF="32"/>
not, in other instances, resemble the famous Marquis de
Bedmar, of whom, in his Memoires, it is said, he had the
power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles,
when he was listening to every thing that was saying by va∣rious
persons, and when he was plotting the destruction of
Venice.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when only five years old, would stand at
the window seat, and hum a tune, and three weeks after∣wards
would relate two different conversations carried on at
the same time, and not only relate them verbatim, but take
off exactly the action and tone of voice of every speaker.
Of this dangerous, however diverting amusement, Mr.
Berkeley was early broke by his Mother.</P>
<P>The first eight years and a half of his life Mr. Berkeley
had no other instructor than his Mother; and such was the
extreme volatility of his genius, the wonderful <HI>strength</HI>
of his understanding, and the <HI>natural</HI> wilfulness of his
temper, that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an
Herculean labour, so much as often to occasion him to say,
when grown up, that <Q REND="inline">"he was <HI>resolved</HI> not to learn to
read; that he did verily believe his Mother was the only
<HI>human</HI> being who could have accomplished it until he
was old enough to feel the necessity of it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton, of Gray's Court, persisted in a like resolution, saying it was nonsense to learn, until he, at thirteen, was sent to sea on board a ship commanded by Sir John Norris, who, on learning the young gentleman's sentiments, assured him, that he should be flogged every day until he could read. The Chaplain was appointed his Tutor. He was, after this declaration, a very apt scholar. This acute, worthy, young gentle∣man died at the age of twenty-two. It is sometimes a misfortune to children to be too clever.</NOTE>;"</Q>—adding,
<PB N="xxv" REF="33"/>
<Q REND="inline">"I think my dear Mother seemed to have been sent into
this world on purpose to <HI>teach</HI> and <HI>govern</HI> me, as I at∣tended
to, nor cared for any one but herself; finding that
<HI>she</HI> alone had that <HI>invincible</HI> perseverance requisite to go∣vern
me."</Q></P>
<P>Before he attained his sixth year, he read incomparably;
and his comments on what he read, and what he saw, of∣ten
occasioned the late George Lord Lyttelton, when staying
at his father's on a visit, to declare <Q REND="inline">"he had the <HI>strongest,</HI> as
well as the <HI>most brilliant</HI> powers of mind he had ever
seen;"</Q> often exclaiming, as did the late learned Dr. Sum∣ner
of Harrow School, and many other great men, <Q REND="inline">"What
a <HI>man</HI> this <HI>very extraordinary child</HI> must become!"</Q> and
Mr. Berkeley more than answered the expectations of his
childhood, as all the learned and great men who had share
in his education bore testimony. His beloved and re∣spected
tutor at Eton, the Reverend Dr. Norbury, too
well known in the learned world to need any eulogium
from a feeble pen, used to say, that there were wonderful
traits of originality in all Mr. Berkeley's exercises. On this
being mentioned one day by a friend to his Father, Mr.
<PB N="xxvi" REF="34"/>
Berkeley, then a young man, said, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my <HI>dear Tutor</HI>
(as, to the time of his death, he ever termed Dr. Nor∣bury)
I do pity him. He used to storm, and say, 'I
have thirty <HI>dolts,</HI> that <HI>cannot</HI> do any thing; and I have three
or four, with that idle varlet Berkeley at their head, that
<HI>can do every thing,</HI> and that <HI>will</HI> do nothing."</Q> And when
Dr. Berkeley used to complain of his son's idleness to Dr.
Norbury, his reply was, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if your son would apply at
<HI>all,</HI> he must carry the world before him; but I must tell
you fairly, such is his genius, that I do not believe that
<HI>man lives,</HI> who can make him apply regularly, until he
comes <HI>himself</HI> to see the necessity of it."</Q></P>
<P>The very learned Dr. Hill, professor of Greek at the uni∣versity
of St. Andrew's, (now Dean of the Chapel Royal at
Edinburgh,) where Mr. Berkeley <HI>did</HI> apply, used to say, that
he would engage to select Mr. Berkeley's exercise from
amongst a thousand, without any other mark than what
the French term <Q REND="inline">"<HI>le marque</HI> d'ouvrier."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, although he could not be called a
<HI>man</HI> of business, might with propriety be termed a <HI>crea∣ture</HI>
of business, from seven years old; for he always felt
himself, as he thought, equal to transact any thing that he
offered his services to perform. The following little inci∣dent
may serve to illustrate this: before he was seven years
old, his Mother, being alarmed lest one of his front teeth
should grow uneven from the old one not being removed,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="35"/>
had sent him to town to Hemmet, who very honestly said,
<Q REND="inline">"All would be right if let alone;"</Q> and he proved that his
judgement was as great as his honesty; for, when Mr.
Berkeley grew up, and sometimes went to him for his tooth
powder, he often said, that Mr. Berkeley had the finest and
strongest set of teeth he ever saw in any head. He returned
home with a gentleman who was coming on a visit to his
Father's. A lady of very large fortune happened to be in
the machine, going on a visit to a friend at Taplow. Finding
that he lived in the neighbourhood, she asked him how far
it was from Maidenhead Bridge to Taplow? He replied, that
it was about ten minutes drive. She said, she must walk,
as her friends, not knowing the day of her arrival, could
not send their carriage. He replied, that she certainly
should not do that; for that his Father's coach would be
sent to convey the gentleman and himself; and that he
would certainly have the pleasure of taking her up the hill
to her friend's house. The instant he got out of the ma∣chine
he enquired of Mr. March if his Father's coach was
come, and had the mortification to hear, that the coach∣man
had called to say, that the carriage was gone on to
carry some gentlemen over Maidenhead Thicket, and would
call for him in an hour. Mr. Berkeley, not then seven
years old, said, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, it is very <HI>improper that a lady</HI>
should walk on the high road <HI>alone;</HI> so <HI>I</HI> will have the
honour of walking up with you. I can borrow a <HI>stick</HI> of
Mr. March."</Q> This <HI>protection</HI> was, as will naturally be
<PB N="xxviii" REF="36"/>
supposed, politely declined; and the lady ordered a chaise.
As soon as she alighted, her first question was, <Q REND="inline">"Do you
know Dr. Berkeley of Cookham?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, intimately."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Do you know his little boy? If you do not, you do not
know, I very believe, the most sensible little crea∣ture
in the world, and the politest;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"there was a
tall young man (of, I suppose, near thirty) with him; but
the dear child has twenty times his sense, and forty times
his politeness."</Q> The gentleman was a learned man, who
laughed at that pleasing accomplishment, politeness: he
was <HI>then</HI> what <HI>fine</HI> men are <HI>now.</HI> Mr. Berkeley was almost
idolized by the family to whom the lady was going; so it
appeared not so wonderful to them.</P>
<P>In the May after he had completed his eighth year, Dr.
Berkeley went to reside at his prebendal house in the Oaks
at Canterbury, where he was immediately sent to the
King's school, under the care of those two eminent masters,
the learned, accomplished, elegant Dr. Beauvoir, and
the reverend, learned, and worthy Mr. Tucker. In Au∣gust,
a gentleman's family going to France to place a
son at St. Quintin, to learn the language; his Mother sug∣gested
to his Father the advantage of sending Mr. Berkeley,
who, although she had taught him to read French well, yet
found it impossible, with an house full of English servants,
to make him speak it; and as it never was the considera∣tion
of a moment with his parents, whether any thing con∣cerning
<PB N="xxix" REF="37"/>
their children's education was to cost one guinea or
one hundred, immediately determined to send him. Young
as he was, he was the only one of the party who knew any
thing of French; and the sensible amiable lady, whose son
was going to learn the French language, at her return, de∣clared,
that they should have been half starved at the inns
and hotels, had not Mr. Berkeley been with them, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"That lovely little creature seemed quite inspired; for he
began in French telling the waiters it was a shame to let
English ladies and gentlemen sit there without their tea
and chocolate."</Q> He used to run to the bar, and drive
them in before him with whatever was wanted. In his
own language, it may with strictest truth be asserted,
that even at that early period of life he was a great profi∣cient;
for there is not a word in the English language which,
at the age of seven years, he could not spell without book;
and of most of the difficult words, he perfectly understood
their sense, and used them with the strictest propriety;
which occasioned the sensible Sir J. Temple, brother of
the abovenamed amiable lady, who accompanied her to
France, repeatedly to say, <Q REND="inline">"I never saw so sensible a crea∣ture.
Here is my nephew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very amiable D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, of Hampshire.</NOTE>, just double his age, who
has been under private tuition for five years, is no more
capable of expressing himself in the elegant language <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This had been by him easily acquired; his Mother having, from the age of three years, every morning, after he had spelt his lesson, regularly explained to him the meaning of two words, of five, six, or seven syllables. This easy task, to both mistress and scholar, produced a laughable circumstance. One day, when Mr. Berkeley was about three years and a half old, after dinner he being at play in the window, a gentleman who had dined at Dr. Berkeley's speaking of the unfortunate Captain B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, said, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! poor man; it is pity his father and mother did not take it into their heads to marry before he was born: it makes the difference of 4000 l. a year to him."</Q> Mr. Berkeley turned round, and said, <Q REND="inline">"Poor man! I pity him exceedingly. It is a <HI>very</HI> great misfortune to be illegitimate."</Q> The gentleman, turning to him, said <Q REND="inline">"You little animal, how could you become acquainted with a word almost as long as yourself?"</Q> No one supposed him attending to the conversation; but, from the time he was capable of speaking, although deeply engaged at play, he would frequently, a week after, relate <HI>verbatim</HI> even long conversations, with every gesture, and the tone of voice of every speaker. In mimickry he was an adept, but was early taught by his Mother the danger of indulging it, and very rarely indeed practised it, never but when earnestly requested by some very intimate friend, and in very select company.</NOTE> of
<PB N="xxx" REF="38"/>
this little creature, than I am of scaling the skies;"</Q> add∣ing,
<Q REND="inline">"I shall watch him through life, and bid adieu to all
<HI>my</HI> sagacity, if he does not become one of the greatest
men of the age."</Q> Mr. Berkeley remained somewhat less
than a year in France, boarding in the house of a truly re∣spectable
Roman catholic <HI>negociant</HI> of the name of Mont∣jole,
under the kind inspection of the truly amiable Pro∣testant
family of Fitzou. The unfeigned affection he ever
retained for the French friends of his early youth appeared
when, at the age of seventeen, he published his <Q REND="inline">"Maria,
or the Generous Rustic,"</Q> by his selecting the names of
his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families
with whom he lived, and those by whom he was caressed
<PB N="xxxi" REF="39"/>
and delighted, indeed almost idolized, for he had ever most
engaging attracting manners. His heroine took her name
from the servant of Monsieur and Madame Montjole, who
loved him so tenderly, that when he was to quit St. Quin∣tin,
at the age of between nine and ten, she was obliged
to be sent by her mistress for two or three days to visit her
parents, while <HI>le petit général Angloise,</HI> as he was univer∣sally
called at that place, from his collecting a number of
boys a little older than himself, and exercising them every
evening, and marching them with a drum and other mar∣tial
music about the town, after which he used frequently
to entertain them with fruit, cakes, &amp;c. His <HI>séjour</HI> in
France fully answered, as perhaps very few Englishmen
were ever more throughly masters of the French language,
speaking and writing it as correctly as he did his mother
tongue. On being thanked by a gentleman, who had re∣quested
him to take up his pen, for his elegant translation
of "Nina," inscribed to the Honourable Mr. Hobart, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the favour was very trifling, for (excepting
the sonnet) it employed me only just six hours."</Q></P>
<P>When a child at the King's School at Canterbury, his
mother used to rise at six o'clock in summer, to walk with
him out of the city for country air. One morning, about
seven o'clock, passing by the city wall, a woman with a
child sat begging. As Mrs. Berkeley never gave to tram∣pers,
she told the woman, she could not relieve her. Mr.
<PB N="xxxii" REF="40"/>
Berkeley, then little more than eight years old, unobserved,
stayed behind talking to her. When he joined his Mother,
she began reproving him, by saying, <Q REND="inline">"It is very wrong to
talk to such persons without one means to relieve them,
and that she was persuaded his yesterday's allowance was
all gone:"</Q> to which he replied, in his sweetly melodious
voice, <Q REND="inline">"Why, the poor woman said she had not ate a <HI>morsel
to-day</HI> (the church clock struck <HI>seven</HI> as he was speaking);
and I told her, I had no money; but asked her, if some
gingerbread nuts that I bought last night would be any
comfort to her and her <HI>poor little child;</HI> and she said yes;
so I stayed that I might get them <HI>all</HI> out of my pocket
for her."</Q></P>
<P>His mother's eyes filled with tears of gratitude to God for
having blessed her child with <HI>such</HI> an heart; and she has fre∣quently
declared that had she been offered fifty thousand
pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that (through
life) lovely heart, she would have rejected it. The same sweet
spirit attended him amidst all his torturing illness. Not many
days before his death, a poor family in distress being named,
he turned on the sofa on which he was lying, and, not finding
in his pocket what he thought sufficient to send them, eagerly
desired his servant might be called, to take his keys to get
him some more money, to send to them; and, when his
mother assured him that they had been already relieved by
his father and aunt, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"that a <HI>little</HI> more would
comfort them!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xxxiii" REF="41"/>
When Mr. Berkeley was between ten and eleven years
old, a melancholy affair happened at Canterbury. One of
those unfortunate orphans who are said to be <HI>happy</HI> in
having CAREFUL guardians, had, in the summer vacation,
stepped over from London to Paris, had there spent more
than his scanty allowance, had repeatedly applied to his
<HI>careful</HI> guardians (one, I think, his maternal uncle) for a
little of his <HI>own</HI> money. His humble suit was rejected.
He, however, reached Dover without a guinea; he again
applied, but in vain. Utterly unable to reach London, this
unfortunate youth, not yet nineteen, sallied forth on
the high road between Dover and Canterbury. He unfor∣tunately
met with an <HI>amiable</HI> farmer and his <HI>compassionate
cara-sposa</HI> in what is called an hurdy-gurdy. From the
former he took a silver-pewter watch with a greasy leather
chain, and a fox's head set in brass; from the other, about
seventeen shillings. This worthy pair drove with all speed
to raise an hue and cry after their <HI>foot</HI> highwayman.
The poor youth returned to the alehouse whence he sallied
out, borrowed a petticoat of the maid servant, got a cork,
blacked his face, and escaped into a wood, where he was
taken, and in this wretched disguise brought to Canterbury.
The news of so extraordinary a figure was soon spread; the
children belonging to the King's School went beyond their
bounds to see him. Mr. Berkeley soon returned, and told
his Mother the lamentable tale. She, of course, moralized
on the subject. Soon a violent noise was heard; Mr.
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="42"/>
Berkeley started to the window; then, sitting down, ex∣claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Good God! how can our boys be such brutes!"</Q>
and looked as pale as death. His Mother, who is short∣sighted,
asked him what it was? He replied, <Q REND="inline">"The justices
are sitting, and this poor creature is going to be exa∣mined,
and our boys are hallooing after him, as if
he were a mad dog."</Q> It being one of those days on
which the school hours permit the gentlemen's sons who
board at home to dine with their families, Mrs. Berke∣ley
observed, that her son did not eat at all, but leaned
back in his chair. She enquired if he was ill; he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What ails you then, that you do not eat? Eat
your dinner, I desire you."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I cannot eat
a morsel,</HI> for thinking of this poor creature, just gone to
St. Dunstan's gaol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At his examination several questions were asked him, the answering of which tended to his crimination. Dr. Berkeley, who, although in the com∣mission for Kent, Berks, and Middlesex, never acted, called out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"Young man, do not answer any question that is asked you. Thank God the laws of England do not oblige any man to accuse himself."</Q> The youth took his advice. The farmer and his odious dame swore so <HI>readily</HI> and so <HI>posi∣tively</HI> through every thing, that he was committed, and took his trial at Maid∣stone, and was transported for three years. He lived, however, to return, and enjoy a good fortune, and, no doubt, thank his careful guardians.</NOTE>."</Q> He accordingly went without his
dinner. The next day, when he came in from school at
twelve o'clock, he repaired, as usual, to his Mother's
dressing-room. He gently approached his Mother, and
began as follows: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mamma, I am sure I should
<PB N="xxxv" REF="43"/>
be very sorry to ask <HI>you</HI> to do <HI>any thing improper</HI> for a lady
to do; but could there be any impropriety in your or∣dering
John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very worthy Mr. Wrightson, now master of the workhouse at Can∣terbury, who lived with Dr. Berkeley near thirty years, and married from his service, was in the house when Mr. Berkeley was born. He ever took the most tender, judicious, and respectful care of him in infancy and youth. A very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated, of Mr. Wrightson's bargain∣ing with a bargeman, to buy Mr. Berkeley, then six years old, which entirely cured Mr. Berkeley of a <HI>most dangerous</HI> trick, of which had Mr. Wrightson told his Mother, the little man would have received a heavy chastisement indeed.</NOTE> to carry that <HI>poor</HI> young man a few bottles
of wine to the gaol? for my heart bleeds for him, and <HI>I</HI>
have not money enough to buy him wine."</Q> His Mother
told him she would mention it at dinner to his Father, who,
she was very certain, would give orders concerning it.
Perhaps the poor young man owed the preservation of his
life to Dr. Berkeley's philanthropy.</P>
<P>At the age of twelve, he lost his only brother, near four
years younger than himself, of whom he was most passio∣nately
fond, and whose death he ever lamented till he
was going to rejoin him in the realms of bliss. As children
this was remarkable. The exquisite beauty of his brother
attracted the eyes of all beholders, drew persons to their
doors and windows to look at him, which, so entirely void
of envy was Mr. Berkeley through life, that he used to
come home in extacies, telling his mother how every body
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="44"/>
admired his <HI>brother's</HI> beauty. When he was about six years
old, a lady meeting him one day, who admired him much,
asked him if his little brother was like him. He instantly re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"O dear, Madam, not at all; he is a vast deal hand∣somer
than I am: every body wonders at his beauty that
meets him in the street."</Q> When one was about eight,
the other rather more than four years old, the celebrated
George Lord Lyttelton, staying some time on a visit at Dr.
Berkeley's, said to a gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"that he did really think,
that, mind and person, they were the very finest children
he had ever seen during the course of his life."</Q></P>
<P>The death of Mr. Berkeley's younger brother, caused
by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in Canterbury,
occasioned his being removed to Eton school some months
sooner than was intended by his Father; but his Mother,
trembling for her darling, the moment the physician pro∣nounced
his brother's fever infectious, begged he might
be sent away immediately, which he was within the hour,
under the care of a faithful tender servant, who lived at his
Father's family at the time of his birth, and until within
about four years of Mr. Berkeley's death, when he married.
For this worthy man Mr. Berkeley ever retained the most
grateful regard and affection, as did his Parents, for his con∣stant
unwearied attention paid by him to the health, the
manners, the morals, of their ever-to-be-lamented son. To
this worthy person's care was he constantly confided, from
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="45"/>
the time that he began to run alone, until after he quitted
Eton school, and had a servant of his own. Mr. Berkeley
used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"It is not easy to express the grati∣tude
I feel towards John, for his wonderfully judicious
method of managing such a refractory chap as I was,
especially when I was from home, and he had not my
Mother to call in to his aid."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, with perhaps as amiable, as lovely a nature
as ever God bestowed on any fallen child of Adam, had a
very high spirit, and a very uncommonly wilful temper.
Mr. Wrightson, by civility, gentleness, and ridicule, as a
child and youth could prevail on Mr. Berkeley to give up
any project to do any thing. Mr. Berkeley had a very
affectionate regard for him; and, when visiting at his Fa∣ther's
from Oxford or the Temple, if it were but from
Saturday to Monday, he used constantly to say, <Q REND="inline">"I must
go and sit half an hour with my old friend John in his
pantry, and talk over old times, or he will think me
unkind;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure I owe it to him, for the
<HI>judicious</HI> care he took of me in childhood and youth."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's behaviour to servants, as servants, was, from
early youth, very remarkably kind; and he never had any
servant who would not have risqued almost every thing to
serve and oblige him, excepting one Italian, whom he took
for a few weeks, after an old servant of his married. This
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="46"/>
execrable villain threatened to murder him, for having or∣dered
him to go a journey on the top of a stage-coach,
Mr. Berkeley having a friend in the post-chaise with him.
Such are foreign servants more frequently than is imagined
by the <HI>wise</HI> persons who confide in them in preference to
their own countrymen, who are seldom tempted to rob
or murder a master, having no foreign tongue to secure
them a <HI>safe</HI> retreat on the Continent.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's tutor at Eton was, as mentioned above,
the learned and respectable Dr. Norbury, under whose tui∣tion
he had been placed by his Father, at the <HI>earnest</HI> re∣quest
of his Mother, who knew his merits as a tutor,
having resided at Windsor four years before her marriage,
and conceived him particularly calculated to direct <HI>such</HI> a
spirit as her darling son. The event proved that she was
not mistaken; for, volatile and idle as Mr. Berkeley was,
it is certain Dr. Norbury contrived to make him apply more
than ever any one before had done, excepting his Mother,
who often regretted, that, finding what cast of genius her
eldest son had, she had not set about learning Latin and
Greek, that she might have <HI>made</HI> him apply more closely
in his youth. As a proof of Mrs. Berkeley's inflexible
steadiness, in teaching her son and correcting his perverse∣ness
of temper, she once made him say the word "Nico∣demus"
<HI>thirty</HI> times, when he was about five years old,
which he either could not, or would not, pronounce pro∣perly.
<PB N="xxxix" REF="47"/>
When grown up, he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear
Mother, it was <HI>would not;</HI> for it was one of my numerous
trials of skill with you;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"but you were <HI>very
wise</HI> to do it, or God knows what must have become
of me!"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley's grand object was to see his son as great a
scholar as his father Bishop Berkeley. Never having been
at any school himself, but coming immediately from the
palace of Cloyne to Christ Church in Oxford, he had
conceived that Eton collegers, if they had talents, must
necessarily be excellent scholars; and, after his son had been
a considerable time at Eton, boarding at the house of the
worthy Mrs. Tyrrell, and her truly amiable niece Mrs.
Brookland, whom Mr. Berkeley, through his life, termed
<Q REND="inline">"that angelic-tempered woman,"</Q> he dutifully submitted
to go into the long chamber, to the extreme affliction of
his Mother, who conjured his Father, with many tears,
not to remove him; but he consulted, and followed the
advice of, the then provost of Eton, Dr. Barnard, although
he had, by his accomplished, worthy friend, the late Dr.
Sumner, of Harrow, been cautioned against his wiles, in
these remarkable words: <Q REND="inline">"Never trust that man: he has a
<HI>black</HI> heart: I had myself been head master of Eton, my
friends in power having secured it for me; but, on my
asking if Dr. Barnard was to be provost, and being an∣swered
in the affirmative, I, for that <HI>sole</HI> reason, begged
<PB N="xl" REF="48"/>
to decline it."</Q> The subsequent conduct of Dr. Barnard
fully justified the truth of the character Dr. Sumner had
given of him. Could any man but Dr. Barnard have treated
the first school in England, over which he had so long pre∣sided,
and which he had, upon the whole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the <HI>whole</HI> so well; for certainly, in some instances, he was tyranni∣cal, even cruel, which the following well-known fact must prove to all impar∣tial persons. The late General Brudenell, deputy governor of Windsor Castle, being with his regiment in Germany, one day, as his lady was sitting at dinner, her son from Eton came in. She naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole school day. The youth (aged between thirteen and fourteen) replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I am expelled."</Q> Mrs. Brudenell (the knife and fork dropping from her hand) exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God! child, what have you done? Have you killed a boy?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, I have done nothing but called my dame's upper maid a thief."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"That is impossible, child: you must have done something worse than that, or I am sure Dr. Barnard would not have expelled you."</Q> The boy related the whole transaction, which appeared to her so utterly incredible, that she instantly sent a servant to request a gentleman of large fortune, her near neighbour, to call on her immediately; when the youth related to him the following facts, as they proved to be: <Q REND="inline">"That, having lost his Dictionary, he borrowed one, for two or three days, of some boys; but, finding that inconvenient, he and two of his friends went to the second-hand bookseller's in Eton, to try to buy one. A Dictionary was immediately produced, when one of his friends said, 'It is exactly like your own.' The other said, 'I verily believe it is your own.' Young Brudenell asked of whom he bought it. The man without hesitation said, 'Of dame <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s upper maid. She told me, a boy, who had left school, had given it to her.' On a close inspection, there appeared a paper pasted over the inside of the cover. This being removed, Master Brudenell's name, and the date of the year when it was bought at Mr. Pote's, appeared. They carried it off; and, as soon as they arrived there, shewed it to the rest of the boys of the house, who unanimously agreed to interrogate the woman, how it came into her possession. She coloured, and replied, that she picked it up in their gate∣way. They asked her, if she could not read writing. She said, 'No.' This they knew to be false; but one of the larger boys said, 'You must naturally have supposed that it belonged to some of us, and you are a thief; so they agreed to call her thief for a week. This so exasperated her, that she com∣plained to her Mistress, who instantly shewed Brudenell up to Dr. Barnard, the boy refused to be flogged until Dr. Barnard had heard his case; and if he did not find it true, he would suffer any thing he pleased to inflict. This he utterly refused, and instantly expelled him."</Q> The gentleman immediately went down to Eton, and, on examination, every tittle of Brudenell's account appeared to be literally true; but Dr. Barnard positively refused to re-admit him—Dr. Barnard shewed of what <HI>materials</HI> his heart was composed, by his <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> conduct to several amiable worthy young ladies in the neighbourhood.</NOTE>, so well go∣verned,
with such marked contempt as he did, by not suf∣fering
<PB N="xli" REF="49"/>
his son to be educated at that school, but keeping
him at home in his own house, and introducing some per∣son
to teach him there, never permitting him to associate
or play with the fine youths of the school. A few insigni∣cant
boys were now and then introduced to play with
Master Barnard. Could five hundred youths and boys,
some of them sons of the first <HI>noblesse</HI> of these three king∣doms,
others sons of the first scholars in those kingdoms,
degenerate in a <HI>few days</HI> after the <HI>famous</HI> Dr. Barnard
ceased to govern them, that he could prefer all the <HI>un∣comfortable
inconveniences of an home-education</HI> for his only
child? Had Dr. Barnard been removed to the pro∣vostship
of King's College, <HI>something</HI> might have been of∣fered
in excuse for this cruel conduct to the new Master,
<PB N="xlii" REF="50"/>
a man of profound erudition, and, before he became master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was well known to the Writer before he became Master; she meeting him often at the house of her learned, sensible, throughly agreeable, lively, friend, the late H. B. Buckeridge, Esquire; where some of the most joyous even∣ings—mornings of her life, alas for poor Mr. Buckeridge—were (what, as with every body, late-early hours) sadly injured, in company with many amiable old friends and neighbours, now no more. It used to be said, that the party would last a week round, but for the agreeable, amiable Dr. Bostock, father of Sir C. Rich, and the Writer; who jointly agreed, that they could not live without sleep.</NOTE>,
of amiable disposition and gentle manners; but Dr. Bar∣nard,
the world at that time said, meant to have a foil, as
he never could shew his wit without a <HI>but;</HI> which occasioned
his bringing in that poor weak creature, Teddy Betham,
fellow of Eton.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, being ever a most obedient son, went into
college; but he soon found very different treatment from
what he had a right to expect from some of those in
power. Dr. Barnard promised Dr. Berkeley, that he would
send for him frequently, and pay every attention to the
grandson of the great Bishop Berkeley. Mr. Berkeley never
entered the provost's house after he became <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a poor col∣leger</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The style of Dr. Barnard for the younger sons of many gentlemen of good family.</NOTE>."</Q> His father, in order to remedy the evil, per∣mitted
him to spend two hundred pounds a year during
the whole time he remained in the college.</P>
<P><PB N="xliii" REF="51"/>
It was evident, that Mr. Berkeley <HI>never</HI> escaped pu∣nishment,
when it could at any rate be contrived to inflict
it; and as a colleger, he became more liable to it. His
Father, learning this from other young men, as well as
from his son, offered to take him from college; but, with
that fortitude, which attended him through life, through
his torturing illness for the last three years of it to his latest
breath, he declined it, saying, <Q REND="inline">"It was but for a few
years."</Q> However, when he was a little turned of six∣teen,
his Father, instead of letting him remain until nine∣teen,
which was his original intention, took him home to
his house at Cookham, determining to become his tutor
for two years, until he went to Oxford, whither he in∣tended
to remove his family during Mr. Berkeley's <HI>séjour</HI>
at that university; and the refusal of a house in St. Giles's
was secured to Dr. Berkeley, which was occupied by the
very sensible R. Harcourt, Esquire, for the same wise and
kind purpose; and it happily succeeded.</P>
<P>On Mr. Berkeley's quitting school, in order to atone for
the want of cricket at dear Eton, Mr. Berkeley had a
fine hunter kept for him by his Father, and he generally
hunted twice a week with the buck hounds. Mr. Berke∣ley
rode remarkably well.</P>
<P>The village and neighbourhood of Cookham, it should be
observed, though a very fluctuating one, happened, very
<PB N="xliv" REF="52"/>
lukily for Mr. Berkeley, just at that time, to abound with
sensible, cultivated, polished families; had his Parents se∣lected
them, they could not have done it more in general
to their wish. These families, viz. the polite Lord Co∣nyngham's;
the learned, accomplished Daniel Mal∣thus's,
Esquire; the very sensible Thomas Forster's, Es∣quire;
Thomas Parry's, Esquire; and those of two
very sensible Ladies, in two small houses; lived in the
strictest harmony, perpetually meeting at each other's
houses; which occasioned Mr. Berkeley's Mother one day
to ask, <Q REND="inline">"Where is our next PARISH meeting to be held?"</Q>
and they ever after retained the name. In the summer,
parties on the water to different parts of the banks of that
beautiful river the Thames; in the winter evenings, music,
little dances, and that most amusing of all round games,
Pope Joan.</P>
<P>To the above may be added, the large and agreeable
society at Taplow; the politest of men, Lord Inchiquin,
and the Honourable, Reverend, sensible, and truly wor∣thy
Mr. Hamilton, with his agreeable family, the sensible,
and worthy relict of General Leighton, with her accom∣plished
daughters. It will naturally be supposed, that
Mr. Berkeley could not quit such <HI>very</HI> agreeable society
without a pang<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The "Farewell to the Banks of the Thames" was written about this time.</NOTE>, especially when part of it was composed
<PB N="xlv" REF="53"/>
of more than half a score such young ladies, of whom it
may, without flattery or compliment, be asserted, were
very rarely to be met with <HI>even then;</HI> and Mr. Berkeley
was ever a much greater admirer of a sensible accom∣plished,
than of a very beautiful woman, insomuch that
his beloved, respected, revered friend, Miss M-lth-s<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley wrote and printed, but never published, a most beautiful, elegant Elegy on the ever to be lamented death of that lovely, all-accom∣plished, angelic young lady, which happened in the summer of the year 1786.</NOTE>, used
laughingly to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"that HE really did not know a
beautiful woman from a plain one;"</Q> so that it became a
kind of cant expression amongst his young friends, if any
sensible, plain, young woman was named, <Q REND="inline">"that she was
one of BERKELEY's beauties."</Q></P>
<P>But to return. When the time of Mr. Berkeley's de∣parture
drew near, he, very humbly and sensibly, requested
his Father to permit him to pass three years at the uni∣versity
of St. Andrew in Scotland; by which time, to use
his own words, <Q REND="inline">"All my <HI>dear</HI> idle Eton friends will have
quitted Oxford, and <HI>I</HI> shall not be tempted to go out
twice a week with Lord Abingdon's hounds."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley took his last farewell of his amiable
friends at the Ferry-house, he could not articulate, went
out, mounted his horse, and followed the carriage over
the Ferry. It was a long, and not a very pleasant journey,
<PB N="xlvi" REF="54"/>
to quit a beautiful native country, to adopt the language
of the poet, speaking of the soul entering the world of
spirits,
<Q><L>— to go,</L>
<L>To be she knows not what, she knows not where.</L></Q></P>
<P>His parents accompanied him to the land of kind hospita∣lity,
as it must ever be termed by the Writer of this Preface,
where Mr. Berkeley passed three years and an half most
happily; where he formed a friendship with some of the
first characters in that kingdom, with many persons of rank,
and also amongst the literati, which ended <HI>but with his life.</HI>
Mr. Berkeley had the honour, the <HI>happiness,</HI> to be <HI>enfant
de famille</HI> at Melvil House; and he, with heart-felt gratitude,
termed the exquisitely pious Earl and Countess of Leven
his <HI>Scottish parents.</HI> The goodness of that illustrious pair
not only invited him to visit there for weeks himself, but
also to carry any English or Scotch student he pleased with
him. Mr. Berkeley was too judicious, and too well-bred,
to make an improper use of this condescending goodness,
having never introduced any but two or three Englishmen,
sons of men of rank or fashion, constantly saying, <Q REND="inline">"Lord
Leven <HI>must</HI> know the characters of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of young
Scottish gentlemen too well for <HI>me</HI> to introduce them."</Q>
With what delight would he often talk of the happy hours
spent at Melvil House, and his gratitude to his honoured
<PB N="xlvii" REF="55"/>
friend for inviting him attend him to Edinburgh, when his
lordship was appointed by his Majesty lord high commis∣sioner
of Scotland, as also one of his introduced-friends,
the son of an English Peer, and his lordship's giving
<HI>express</HI> orders, that Mr. Berkeley should never dine any
one day at the purse bearer's table, but always at the com∣missioner's!
It is impossible to dismiss this article without
attempting to celebrate the wonderful condescending amia∣bility
of the <HI>noblesse</HI> of Scotland particularly, and in com∣mon
with the ancient gentry of that kingdom, to strangers
of any degree of fashion, and decent character. It was a
common remark of Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Were a Scotch gentle∣man
to settle for some time in any <HI>southern</HI> or <HI>eastern</HI>
county of England, I wonder how many peers, or men
who in <HI>fortune</HI> equal peers, would visit him?"</Q> And al∣most
every peer and man of fortune in Fife have done us
that honour; which must ever be remembered with the
most heart-felt gratitude by the Writer of this Preface.
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! shame to our <HI>English pride!</HI>"</Q> used to exclaim Dr.
Berkeley. Although born in London, he spent the first
eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illus∣trious-minded
Father in the <HI>next</HI> hospitable country in Eu∣rope
to Scotland: for the Scotch do certainly exceed even
the Irish. As Mrs. Wedderburn used to say to the Wri∣ter
of these pages, <Q REND="inline">"The Irish give you an excellent dinner
and supper, and let you go out to <HI>seek</HI> a bed; <HI>we</HI> always
find one."</Q> The remark was just, and worthy the great
<PB N="xlviii" REF="56"/>
good sense of that throughly hospitable polite lady, who,
having heard that Dr. Berkeley's family, none of whom
she had ever then seen, were travelling near her house, im∣mediately
ordered her beds to be prepared, and most po∣litely
visited them at their inn, telling them that every
thing was ready for their reception. This, and numberless
other almost similar attentions from numerous other fa∣milies
of rank and fashion has, for the last fifteen years,
caused the writer of this to term Scotland the Land of
polite <HI>kind</HI> Hospitality. Such may it long continue; and
they meet a more grateful return than they often do, when
they visit England; than did the amiable <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of
Scotland, from the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who went in and
<HI>hid</HI> himself when he saw the equipage of his noble host in
his park—one is tempted to wonder that he ever could
emerge from his hiding place. One of the amiable sons of
Lord Leven, coming from abroad, went to an inn at Can∣terbury
before he went to Dr. Berkeley's. He reproached
him, on Mr. Leslie's saying, <Q REND="inline">"He feared being trouble∣some."</Q>
Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, if a <HI>dog</HI>
came hither with a collar on his neck from Melvil
house, I should feel myself a monster not to entertain
him."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley used often to be accused of par∣tiality
to Scotland, and to his Scottish friends. Indeed he
had one of the most amiable hearts that ever beat in a hu∣man
<PB N="xlix" REF="57"/>
breast. It must have been a <HI>very cold</HI> heart that had
not felt such amiable, such respectful, attentions as Mr.
Berkeley received in his seven hundred miles tour through
the unfrequented parts of the Highlands; which was chiefly
performed on foot, although Mr. Berkeley had three horses
and two servants, but he often went where they could not
follow him; and at Edinburgh, where he generally passed
the first part of the St. Andrew's vacation, until the grouse
shooting season commenced. Although greatly his su∣periors
in learning, Mr. Berkeley had the honour to
rank amongst his literary friends, Lord Buchan, the pro∣foundly
learned, highly polished, all-accomplished Lord
Monboddo, Mr. M'Kenzie, and Dr. Reid. It is hoped
that the introducing here a <HI>bon mot</HI> of Mr. Berkeley's
may be pardoned. Lord Monboddo, when visiting Dr.
Berkeley at St. Andrew's, with his usual exquisite po∣liteness,
pressed the Doctor and his family to visit him at
Monboddo, and invited Mr. Berkeley to pass the next vaca∣tion
there. Mrs. Berkeley said to her son, <Q REND="inline">"Surely you
will go: it will be a wonderful advantage to you, to pass
so many weeks under the roof of <HI>such</HI> a man as Lord
Monboddo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. George Berkeley, from its first publication, was an enthusiastic ad∣mirer of Lord Monboddo's "Ancient Metaphysics," so as to occasion Mr. Monck Berkeley's always styling it his Mother's <HI>second</HI> Bible. The first volume
then only published, Lord Monboddo did Mrs. Berkeley the honour to send
her the second, saying, he found she understood it, with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned, worthy Professor Hunter, a very sincerely highly respected friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley. One of the most striking likenesses ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius, now in the possession of Mrs. George Berkeley, in his robes of a throughly upright just Judge. It instantly, on en∣tering the room, catches the eye of every stranger who has any skill in painting, and very often of those who are honest enough to declare they have not any skill.</NOTE>."</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Ma∣dam,
<PB N="l" REF="58"/>
I am convinced, that if I do go, I shall return home
the best Greek scholar in the university; but I have great
doubts, whether my <HI>heart</HI> may not be more injured than
my <HI>head</HI> benefited;"</Q> alluding to that loveliest of women,
Miss Burnett, his Lordship's truly angelic darling daughter,
no longer an inhabitant of this sublunary world, but gone
to join her kindred spirits. That lovely young lady can be
only a <HI>very</HI> little more angelic in mind than when on
earth. Shakspeare's beautiful distich on a young woman
in a country church-yard in Gloucestershire might have
been inscribed on the monument of Eliza Burnett, rather
than on that of Eleanor Freeman:
<Q><L>"Rest here, blest Maid, and wait th' Almighty's will;</L>
<L>"Then rise unchang'd, and be an Angel still."</L></Q></P>
<P>Perhaps very few females, in any age or country, have
united so much beauty, good sense, and amiableness of
disposition, <Q REND="inline">"and have borne their faculties so meekly,"</Q> as
the lovely Miss Burnett. She possessed all her honourable
father's great superiority of understanding, and all the re∣fined
<PB N="li" REF="59"/>
delicacy and genuine humility of her very lovely mo∣ther.
She saw, she could not <HI>but see,</HI> herself the idol of
all the young men; yet not one air of superiority, not a
grain of affectation, ever appeared in her conduct. A va∣riety
of diverting little anecdotes of the universal desire of
the young gentlemen students of St. Andrew's to appear
agreeable, at least not disagreeable, to Miss Burnett, might
be related by the writer, to the amusement of the reader.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, one of those few Laymen, as
Dr. Berkeley used to observe, who kept up their classical
learning after they had quitted the university, (for he ge∣nerally
redde Greek from four to six hours every day,) was
a great admirer of the rising genius of Mr. Berkeley, inso∣much
that he became sincerely attached to him; and Mr.
Berkeley ever retained a most affectionate grateful regard
for this gentleman's condescension, as he termed it, in suf∣fering
a youth from school to enjoy so much of his society,
who had children elder than Mr. Berkeley.</P>
<P>As the families lived in the greatest intimacy, in the
happiest friendship, they generally met three or four times a
week. One evening, at Dr. Berkeley's, the barenness of news∣papers
was, as was <HI>then</HI> usual, I think, everywhere lamented;
<Q REND="inline">"nothing worth reading in them."</Q> Mr. Berkeley reached
out his arm, and taking Dr. Berkeley's constant paper, the
St. James's Chronicle, ran his eye over it, and said, <Q REND="inline">"I think
<PB N="lii" REF="60"/>
there is something in this to-day;"</Q> and began reading
something, which lasted about ten minutes, that every body
agreed <HI>was</HI> worth reading. At night Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> desired
permission to take it home, saying, he would return it in
the morning. The next day at noon he brought it to Dr.
Berkeley's, telling him, <Q REND="inline">"that he believed he had taken
the wrong paper, for he could not find what Mr. Berkeley
read the evening before."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley shewed him all
the last papers, but in vain. At dinner, Mrs. Berkeley asked
her son, <Q REND="inline">"out of what paper he had read the evening before;
not out of the St. James's Chronicle, for that Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> and
she had been searching several of them, and could not
find it."</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I never
doubted of yours or Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s cleverness; but you
must both be much cleverer than I take either of you to
be, if you <HI>could</HI> have found it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why should we not
find it?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Because it was not to be found."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Where
is it then? Tell Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, that he may read it."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Alas! I cannot; for it never was any where but in your
son's brain."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What do you mean, child? I do not un∣derstand
you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Madam, when I hear
people finding such fault with the poor newspapers, I of∣ten
take them up, and help them out, as I did last night.
I have done it scores of times before for my Father and
Aunt, who only <HI>skim</HI> a newspaper. You know, they say
you study it."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="liii" REF="61"/>
It must, however, be observed, in order to do justice to
Mr. Berkeley's gratitude for the numberless polite, amiable,
friendly attentions received from every rank in that land
of kind hospitality during his three years and a half <HI>séjour</HI>
there, that he was almost broken-hearted at quitting it,
and twice after revisited it, and would have continued to
do so had his life been spared. Dr. Berkeley being at that
time in an indifferent state of health, the journey was about
six weeks in performing, as he rested some time at York;
where Mr. Berkeley had, what he ever esteemed an honour,
young as he was, of commencing an acquaintance with
the truly learned and pious Dr. Burgh, by the polite atten∣tions
of his Mother's respected friends, Mrs. Moritts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every person of any fashion, who visits York, endeavours to obtain an introduction to those sensible cultivated ladies; the many only to gratify their eyes with a sight of the exquisitely fine <HI>paintings in needle-work</HI> of the eldest Mrs. Morritt; those who are capable of relishing refined conversation, to feast their minds: the house of those excellent ladies being the general rendezvous of every one who can relish the charms of refined conversation. Mr. Berkeley lamented that his <HI>living</HI> idol, as Gray was his dead one, amongst poets, Mr. Mason, was absent from York at that time.</NOTE>,
whose beautifully adorned house is admired by all persons
who have any skill in painting. By the very polite atten∣tions
of the Dean of York, his Lady, and several other
families of fashion, which were ever most gratefully re∣membered,
Mr. Berkeley and the family passed their time
most agreeably in that antient city, to which the library of
the very civil Mr. Todd contributed in no small degree,
one of the delights of Mr. Berkeley's life being to read in
<PB N="liv" REF="62"/>
a library; a happiness he enjoyed in his Father's house,
Bishop Berkeley's library being valued at two thousand
pounds at the time of his death. Dr. Berkeley, being in∣disposed,
rested some time at Newcastle.</P>
<P>In their road to Edinburgh, they passed through the town
of Lauder. A very little way out of the town stands Lauder
Castle, one of the seats of the late worthy Earl of Lauderdale.
As the horses were to bait at least two hours, Mr. Berkeley,
after dinner, went down to the castle; the family being ab∣sent,
he requested the porter to permit him to enter, and look
at the pictures. He had from his childhood a wonderfully fine
eye for painting. It is probable he owed it to the so often
hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfather's col∣lection
of pictures talked over. The man, who was a tai∣lor,
and hard at work, said he would call his <HI>gewd weef</HI> to
shew him the castle.</P>
<P>It is hoped the reader will pardon the introducing a dia∣logue
between the Gewd Weef and Mr. Berkeley.</P>
<P>Gewd Weef.—<Q REND="inline">"Pray, Laddie, whence come ye, and
whither gang ye, that ye be come to Lauder?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"I came from England, and I am going
to St. Andrew's.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Belike ye come from London.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I came from within about twenty miles of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="lv" REF="63"/>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Were ye ever at the greet toon?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, very often.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Then ye can tell me what they pay there for
washing a <HI>sark,</HI> (i. e. shirt,) for it would be a <HI>great savice</HI>
to me to know. I have always washed my Lord's men's
when the family is at the castle, and they will pay me
but two pence a sark, and I have been told by a many
that they pay <HI>nine</HI> pence there for every sark; and I sadly
want to ken."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"You have been misinformed; I never pay
more than four pence for a full trimmed shirt.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Well-ee wat, that is but little. I have been
told, it is always <HI>nine</HI> pence."</Q></P>
<P>During this dialogue a young woman entered, with her
hair curled and powdered. Mr. Berkeley had asked the Gewd
Weef, how many miles it was to St. Andrew's. She re∣plied
to that, as to almost every thing, <Q REND="inline">"Don-a-ken."</Q> On
the appearance of the young woman, she said, <Q REND="inline">"If you
ask this lassey, she can tell you. She knows muckle
things."</Q> Mr. Berkeley, taking off his hat, made the
enquiry, and was very civilly informed. The young woman,
having dispatched her business with the tailor, went away;
and the dialogue recommenced.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="64"/>Gewd Weef.—<Q REND="inline">"I suppose you 'll gang home this way
from St. <HI>Anders.</HI> Hoo long shall ye tarry there?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"About three years, if it please God I
live so long."</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Three years! for what can ye stay there three
years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may not be amiss to remark here, that every Scotsman thinks it in∣cumbent on him to visit St. Andrew's once in his life, and take a view of the beautiful ruins of the finest Christian temple perhaps ever built by man. During Dr. Berkeley's residence there, one party arrived so late, that they only saw it by the light of an old horn lantern; but, they would say they saw it.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"To study at the university there.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Aye, Laddie! ye ha studied enough. Ye
seem to ken a <HI>vast</HI> deal of pictures, and other larning.
No, no: ye had better tarry here, and marry yon lassey.
She has houses twa, and parks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Scots call fields, parks; and a wood, a policy.</NOTE> five. She 'll mak a
gewd weef, I can tell ye, and you 'll make her a rare
<HI>gewd mon.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I am much obliged to you for your good will
to me; but I am afraid my Father and Mother would
think me too young to marry and settle.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"And where be they?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"At the inn in the town.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="lvii" REF="65"/>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Aye, there's twa pretty lasseys at the inn.
They 'll haa muckle siller. An, aye, take one of them."</Q></P>
<P>At that instant a coach and four drove down, when the
Gewd Weef exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What haa we got coming
here?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"The carriage in which I came from England.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Ye come from England in <HI>that</HI> an-a-carriage;
and wha came wee ye?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my Father and my Mother, and my
Mother's maid.</Q></P>
<P>G. W.—<Q REND="inline">"Aye, Laddie, Laddie; if you came in that
an-a-coach, ye 'll not marry oone of oor Lasseys. What
muckle siller it must haa cost your Father to bring ye <HI>aa</HI>
(i.e. all) doon here."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley then took his leave of the Gewd Weef, pre∣senting
her with a bright half crown, with which she was
much delighted, and wished him a <HI>fine Laady</HI> when he
married.</P>
<P>About three years after, Mr. Berkeley accompanied his
worthy friend, Henry Grimston, Esquire, to the famous
contested election for Yorkshire, Mr. Grimston going up
<PB N="lviii" REF="66"/>
from St. Andrew's, to assist in supporting the interests
of his godfather and friend <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Duncombe, Esquire. They
returned by Lauder, when they, together with their learned
lively tutor, Mr. Bruce, whom they agreed to treat with a
sight of York, visited the castle. Mr. Grimston archly
asked the <HI>gewd weef,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"If she had ever seen that gentleman
before?"</Q> pointing to Mr. Berkeley; when she exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, that I have; and he gave me <HI>half a croon.</HI>"</Q> Mr.
Berkeley, at his second visit, doubled the bounty, and used
frequently to laugh with his friends, and say, that he had
<Q REND="inline">"never met with <HI>such</HI> a friend <HI>since;</HI> for that she endea∣voured,
according to her idea, to procure him a wife
with a <HI>large</HI> fortune."</Q> Soon after his first visit to the
castle, he made a song, entitled, "The Lass of Lauder,"
and had it set to music by Mr. Jenkins, the music-master
at St. Andrew's, but now a teacher of that science in
London. Mr. Berkeley used jocularly to remark, <Q REND="inline">"It is
very certain, that I had not made so <HI>favourable</HI> an im∣pression
on the <HI>lassey</HI> as I had on the <HI>gewd weef</HI> at Lauder;
for she stayed only to settle her business with the tailor,
and then went off."</Q> Some years after, Mr. Berkeley,
being on a visit at Peten-Weem, and going with his friend
to drink tea at a gentleman's house, was asked, <Q REND="inline">"If he had
not once been at Lauder castle?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have
been twice there."</Q> The female who asked the question
said, <Q REND="inline">"I had the honour of seeing you there, Sir; and I
should esteem it an honour if you would drink tea with
<PB N="lix" REF="67"/>
me during your stay here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley instantly re∣collected that it was the <HI>Lass of Lauder,</HI> who did not then
know that she had been <Q REND="inline">"celebrated in song."</Q> Mr. Berke∣ley
was to have left Peten-Weem the next day, but, with
his wonted amiability, postponed it until the day follow∣ing,
that he might visit the <HI>Lass,</HI> who was then married to
the Relief-minister<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Relief-minister is one chosen by the people of any place, where
they do not happen to approve the established Kirk-minister. There are few towns, or even villages, without one. Mr. Berkeley and several other gentle∣men now living, were present, when one of these good men asserted, <Q REND="inline">"That if Zaccheus the publican had been blessed with TREW FAAITHE, he had not fallen from the tree into which he had climbed to see our blessed Lord pass by."</Q> All the company exclaimed, that the good little publican did not fall from the tree, but gladly came down to prepare to receive his heavenly guest. The producing the book of God, and turning to the chapter, very hardly con∣vinced this RELIEF-MINISTER <HI>that he did not fall</HI> for want of TREW FAAITHE.</NOTE> of that place. Several families were
invited to meet him, and a very gay afternoon was spent;
Mr. Berkeley telling Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, that she had made a
better match for herself than the Gewd Weef at Lauder
Castle wished to have made for her. Mr. Berkeley, who
had neither vanity nor conceit, here exceeded the truth.
Dr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, a friend of his father, and the worthy Sir C.
B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, a very old friend of his Mother, both urged him
seriously to visit them, to see after two young ladies of
immense fortunes in their respective counties, assuring him
that he must infallibly succeed. Mr. Berkeley's uniform
reply to all such kind invitations was, <Q REND="inline">"I early resolved, not
to be a fortune-hunter. <HI>I</HI> have no large rent-roll to pro∣duce.
<PB N="lx" REF="68"/>
I will never alarm or distress the <HI>anxious</HI> Parents of
any great Fortunes."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, from his youth, from his Mother, was an <HI>he∣reditary</HI>
admirer and strenuous advocate for the unfortunate
INJURED Mary, and a detester of her cunning, cruel per∣secutor
Elizabeth, requested his Father to go to St. Andrew's
by the road of Kinross, that he might visit the castle of
Loch-Leven; and he spent some time in wandering about
the ruins; so much as occasioned his and his servant's being
benighted on a heath, to the extreme distress of his Mo∣ther,
who was then unacquainted with the exquisite, the
amiable hospitality of the Scottish nation, high and low,
rich and poor; for Mr. Berkeley could with difficulty force
a shilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a
mile over the heath to put him in the road to Cupar-in-Fife,
where his family were to sleep that night, and it was
very late before he and his servant arrived there.</P>
<P>The next morning they all set out for St. Andrew's, about
eight miles distant; and enjoyed, the prospect from the top of
the hill, of the <HI>still</HI> magnificent cathedral, and the tower
of St. Regulus or St. Rule, of which there are four beau∣tiful
engravings with Cardinal Bethune's Castle by Oliphant,
now exceedingly scarce, and very dear, the plates being lost<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is supposed, that when that ingenious young man died, the plates were sold, amongst other metal things, for their weight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="lxi" REF="69"/>
On entering the city at the Argyle Port, your
eye is greeted with a noble wide street, one mile in
length, and at the lower end of a noble breadth, with stone
houses, most of them disfigured by what is termed a <HI>fore
stair,</HI> that is, an open stair case, on the outside, in a zigzag
manner across the front of the house, and an huge <HI>smidie,</HI> a
not inelegant name for a filthy thing, a dunghill; no court,
no palisade, no breast-wall or railing, before even the best
houses, excepting only what was once the palace of James
the First of England; but it is not meant here to give an
imperfect description of this once beautiful magnificent city,
which has been so well done by Boswell and Pennant, be∣fore
John Knox <HI>preached</HI> it into ruins, by removing an
archbishop, dean, and eight resident prebendaries, who fed
the hungry, clothed the naked, and administered to the
wants of the sick and needy, who are all now starving. On
a full sight of this dreary deserted city, Mr. Berkeley wept
to think that he was to remain, if God spared his life, three
long years in it. The house taken for Dr. Berkeley's fa∣mily,
the best then to be had in the town, was without
even a back door, the covetous wretch who owned it having
sold a little spot behind it to a gentleman at the next house;
so the door was stopped up. Dr. Berkeley, seeing Mr.
Berkeley so deeply affected, and Principal Watson, whose
learning had induced him to prefer St. Andrew's to a fo∣reign
university, having died a very few days before, made
Mr. Berkeley the offer of returning to England the next
<PB N="lxii" REF="70"/>
day; for which he felt great gratitude, but, with his wonted
strength of mind, declared, that, let him suffer what he
might, he would remain his three years. It is but justice
to say, that Mr. Berkeley shed more tears at leaving St.
Andrew's, than he drew sighs at entering it.</P>
<P>So deeply was submission to <HI>lawful</HI> authority engraven
on Mr. Berkeley's mind, that during the three years and a
half he was a student at the university of St. Andrew, he
never would go out for even two or three nights to his no∣ble,
truly amiable friend the Earl of Leven's, at Melvil
House, without going to <HI>ask leave out,</HI> as it is termed, of
the Principal Dr. M'Cormick, whom Mr. Berkeley always
called, <Q REND="inline">"our polite, amiable Principal;"</Q> or, in his absence,
of the Professor, who used politely to say, that, <Q REND="inline">"he living
in his Father's house, it was needless to trouble himself."</Q>
His constant reply was, that <Q REND="inline">"the statutes, which he had
promised to observe, <HI>enjoined</HI> it."</Q></P>
<P>It is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which
Mr. Berkeley met with during his residence at St. Andrew's
may be pardoned. A very few days before the term began
in autumn, Mr. Berkeley, who was at that time a very
keen sportsman, was told by the son of the Professor of
Medicine, a very sensible young man, now settled in Ca∣nada,
that, if he wished it, he could lead him to a place
where Ptermagants abounded. The youths set out,
<PB N="lxiii" REF="71"/>
marched several miles; night overtook them, and they
wandered in a very dark evening, unable to find the road.
At length the moon began to appear, and presented to
their view a figure all in white. Mr. Berkeley soon learnt
to speak Scotch so perfectly, as at any time throughout his
life, to be mistaken, whenever he wished it, for a true
Scot; which often amused his friends, or strangers, of that
country, which his Mother ever termed <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Land of kind
Hospitality;</HI>"</Q> a proof whereof will soon appear.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley accosted the young woman with, <Q REND="inline">"Lassey,
whither gang ye?</Q></P>
<P>Lassey.—<Q REND="inline">"To yonder house, Laddie.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Can we get lodging there to night?</Q></P>
<P>Lassey.—<Q REND="inline">"Hoo can ye ask that question with these wea∣pons
in your hands? They <HI>must</HI> lodge ye.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"God forbid that we should attempt to <HI>force</HI>
any one to lodge <HI>us;</HI> and, to convince you how harmless
we are, I will instantly discharge my piece."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley immediately fired off a fine double-barreled
gun, and requested his friend to follow his example. They
then escorted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the
house; where Mr. Berkeley refused to enter until permission
was obtained by their kind guide, who went in alone. In
a minute out rushed <Q REND="inline">"a bevey of fair nymphs,"</Q> more than
<PB N="lxiv" REF="72"/>
twenty, with a matron in the rear, who very wisely began
examining them, how they came on that wild heath at
that hour; who, and what they were. Mr. Berkeley, being
spokesman, assured them that they were honest young men,
students of St. Andrew's. Still they were distrusted.</P>
<P>At length, fortunately for them, a young woman espied a
youth in the highland dress, and, going up to him, asked
<Q REND="inline">"Who he was?"</Q></P>
<P>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Who? why I am servant to that tall gen∣tleman.</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.—<Q REND="inline">"And who is he?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Who? why Mr. Berkeley, secondary at St.
Andrew's.</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.—<Q REND="inline">"Where does he come from, to keep
a servant at college?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, from England."</Q></P>
<P>Young Woman.—<Q REND="inline">"From what part of England?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, from Canterbury. My Master's Fa∣ther
is one of the Prebendaries there, and is a gentleman
of <HI>great</HI> family."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley used to laugh when relating this conversa∣tion,
and say, <Q REND="inline">"All M'Nicoll's account of my Father's <HI>dig∣nity</HI>
in the <HI>church</HI> availed <HI>me no more</HI> than they will do in
<PB N="lxv" REF="73"/>
the world of spirits."</Q> But luckily some one asked Mr.
Berkeley's highlander, <Q REND="inline">"Who was his master's companion?"</Q>
to which he, being irritated, replied, <Q REND="inline">"What does that
signify? He is son to Dr. Flint of St. Andrew's."</Q> The
magical name of Flint, as Mr. Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"acted
like a charm."</Q> Dr. Flint is a most incomparable physi∣cian.
Mr. Flint was immediately examined and <HI>cross exa∣mined;</HI>
and it was determined to admit them, they deli∣vering
up their guns to the nymphs. Mr. Berkeley, with
his usual elegant gallantry, instantly delivered his into the
hands of their kind guide. They then went into the
house, being almost starved with cold, and sadly tired. Plenty
of food, and a good fire, soon re-animated them. Still
they saw nothing but females, all clothed in white. No
male appeared. The men were attending the corn. At
length, they all agreed, that it was time to set off—me∣lancholy
news, as Mr. Berkeley used to say, to a couple of
young men. Whither were they to go? <Q REND="inline">"Could not the
beaux escort them,"</Q> they replied, <Q REND="inline">"to a neighbouring har∣vest-home,
to a dance?"</Q> Mr. Berkeley, who was a remarka∣bly
fine dancer, and loved it exceedingly, jumped up, for∣got
all the fatigues of the day, and said, <Q REND="inline">"that he and his
friend would attend them."</Q> Their hospitable and very sen∣sible
hostess replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Sir! it is not such a ball as you
have been used to in England; there will be only far∣mers'
daughters. I will have the pleasure of endeavouring
to entertain you and Mr. Flint here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="74"/>
with his usual engaging politeness, said, <Q REND="inline">"There will be
<HI>your</HI> daughters, Madam, and our kind conductress to your
hospitable roof."</Q> The young men went and danced in
the barn till four in the morning; slept soundly, as may be
guessed, until near noon; took an excellent <HI>Scotch</HI> break∣fast,
(even Dr. Johnson liked the <HI>breakfasts</HI> in Scotland;)
and, after inviting his kind hostess and her son to dine at
his Father's house in St. Andrew's, when either business
or pleasure called them to that ancient city, took their
leave. The young man went once or twice to Dr. Berke∣ley's.
Mr. Berkeley, who was born with what is com∣monly,
but often falsely, called a princely spirit, although
not to a princely fortune, did not think a few grateful
speeches an adequate return for being rescued from sleeping
among the heather on the heath; but sent his worthy landlady
some fine prints, elegantly framed and glazed, to adorn her
parlour, with which he had great pleasure in finding she
was much delighted. Some of Mr. Berkeley's intimates
among the students laughed at him, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Now, Berke∣ley,
<HI>you</HI> have lain out a night without leave."</Q></P>
<P>The great Charles Leslie, the famous controversial writer,
used to say of Mr. Berkeley's maternal great-grandfather,
the celebrated Francis Cherry, Esquire, of Shottesbrooke
House, in Berkshire, that he believed him to have the most
accurate, the soundest judgement, that God had, in these
latter days, bestowed on man. A multitude of instances
<PB N="lxvii" REF="75"/>
might be adduced to prove, that although Mr. Berkeley in∣herited
but little of Mr. Cherry's immense fortune, he cer∣tainly
did of a better portion than money.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, on his return from his highland tour, told
his family, that he might, he believed, have lived seven
years there, on the merits of the ring sent by the old Che∣valier
de St. George to Mr. Cherry, when he sent Mr. Les∣lie,
at his own expence, to Rome, to try to convert him
from Popery. Mr. Leslie wrote Mr. Cherry word from
Rome, that an attempt to make the sun rise in the WEST
would be equally successful.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"He felt a <HI>little</HI> ashamed, that the
ring should be <HI>so</HI> well known in the Highlands, and that
<HI>he, the presumptive heir to it,</HI> had never seen it more than
once or twice in his life."</Q> He requested his Mother and
Aunt to gratify him with a sight of it, that he might be
able in future to give a <HI>better</HI> account of the famous relic.</P>
<P>It has been already observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See before, p. xix.</NOTE>, that one of Mr. Berkeley's
friends used to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"that he was as extraordinarily de∣scended
by his Mother's side<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">William Cherry, Esquire, known by the name of the Great Lawyer, son of Sir Francis Cherry, esteemed the acutest counsellor of his time, as the learned Earl of Clarendon bears testimony in his Papers and Letters published by Pow∣ney about thirty years ago. In one of the letters he says, <Q REND="inline">"I have had the opi∣nion of the attorney and solicitor general on my cause; but I <HI>cannot rest</HI> satis∣fied till I hear what old Cherry says about it."</Q> Mr. Cherry was at law with King James when he fled. A considerable part of Shottesbrooke estate lies in Windsor Forest. Mr. Cherry had planted some young trees, and was inclosing them. The King rode by, and asked the labourer, <Q REND="inline">"Who bid him do it."</Q> He answered, <Q REND="inline">"My Master, please your Majesty."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It does <HI>not</HI> please me,"</Q> replied the King; <Q REND="inline">"and <HI>I</HI> order you to throw up the inclosure directly."</Q> He did so. Mr. Cherry's old steward informed his Master immediately of it; who ordered that the same labourer should directly set about inclosing it again. The next hunting-morning his Majesty found him at work, and asked, <Q REND="inline">"How he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"His Mas∣ter had ordered it."</Q> The King commanded him to undo his work at his peril; which the poor fellow did; and Mr. Cherry, who when in the country acted as a justice of the peace, committed him to Reading gaol, and com∣menced a suit against the King. Luckily for this poor man, he could not only read, but write; being clerk of the parish of White Waltham, where, and in many surrounding parishes, Mr. Cherry had large farms, and always found and made his tenants find work for the industrious labourers. When the poor inno∣cent culprit reached the gaol, he wrote a long and interesting letter to the King, telling his Majesty, that as his good old Master had now turned him off from his work for obeying him, he hoped his Majesty would be pleased, in his <HI>conside∣ration,</HI> to send him some money to keep him <HI>comfortably</HI> in gaol; and, after much more curious matter, subscribed himself <Q REND="inline">"his Majesty's poor, pitiful, patient, lamentable servant, JOHN HONE."</Q> This letter reached the King about three weeks before he left the kingdom, when Mr. Cherry immediately liberated honest John, and took care that he had every comfort during his im∣prisonment; Mr. Cherry having sent the man to gaol only to teach the Mo∣narch what he might <HI>not</HI> do. Mr. Berkeley had for some years been writing a treatise on "The Prerogatives of the Crown;" and one volume was ready for the press at the time of his death. How far he would have approved his ancestor's conduct in this matter is uncertain. This transaction is somewhat differently told in the old ballad of "The King and Mr. Cherry." This gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in Kent, near the seat of the grandfather of the late worthy Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe, by whom, and his lady, every humane, amiable attention was paid him that his desperate situation would admit of. His death was the more to be lamented by his excellent son, as, on the coroner's inquest, it appeared to have happened through roguery, the verdict being, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Killed by the footboard having been mended with old rusty nails.</HI>"</Q> On going down the hill, the coachman of course pressing more on the footboard than on even ground, it gave way, and he fell down among the horses; who immediately ran away in half a dozen different direc∣tions, threw off the postillion, and broke the chariot entirely to pieces. When they stopped, it was a quarter of an hour before Mr. Cherry's valet de chambre, who was attending his Master on horseback, could discover life either in his Master, Mr. Partridge, of the Isle of Ely, to whom Mr. cherry was guardian, or any of the servants. The moment he found his Master was not dead, he rode off to town, to carry down the Queen's serjeant-surgeon, and sent off from London an express to Mr. Cherry at Shottesbrooke. On the arrival of the surgeon, he asked Mr. Cherry, <Q REND="inline">"Where he felt pain?"</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Sir! where do I <HI>not</HI> feel pain?"</Q> A piece of the plate glass of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a man's hand. Mr. Cherry lived only four days after the accident, the surgeon saying, <Q REND="inline">"He is the noblest ruin I ever saw. I never beheld such a man of eighty-three: but for this ac∣cident, he would probably have attained to the age of old Parr."</Q> Mr. Cherry's strength of body and mind were equal at eighty-three to what they were at thirty-three. This account of Mr. Cherry's death, and Mr. Partridge's almost miraculous escape, is very differently and very erroneously related in a work printed about seventy years ago, by a gentleman of fortune in Devonshire. Mr. Cherry's lady's father, John Whitefield, Esquire, of Ives Place, near Maidenhead, was thrown from his horse, and drowned in the Thames, when taking an airing one evening near his own house, at an advanced age. Mr. Berkeley's Mother's paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his horse, as he was riding one morning near his own house, at the age of eighty-one. The lady of the celebrated Francis Cherry, Esquire, the patron of Thomas Hearne, one of his under-footmen, was the eldest of the five co-heiresses of John Finch, Esquire, of Fienes Court, Berks. In the cloaths of this gentle∣man was King Charles the Second dressed, when he escaped with Lady Jane Lane. Oh! shame to <HI>royal</HI> gratitude, that this lady was not made a Duchess, to descend to her heirs female as well as male. He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"that he had worn Mr. Finch's old cloaths;"</Q> Mr. Finch, having gone down a few weeks before, to marry the beautiful rich heiress of Sir John Chapman, aged fifteen. An exquisitely fine very small miniature of this Lady, by Pettitote, is in the pos∣session of Mr. Monck Berkeley's Aunt, Mrs. Frinsham; it having been pre∣sented to her, by Mr. Berkeley's Mother, at Mrs. Berkeley's marriage.</NOTE>, as he was <HI>nobly</HI> by his Fa∣ther's,
most of his maternal grandsires having had something
<PB N="lxviii" REF="76"/>
remarkable about them."</Q> If Mr. Berkeley had <HI>any</HI> pride,
when a man, which had not been eradicated in his child∣hood
by the incessant pains raken to eradicate it, it was
what is called, I think, very erroneously, <HI>family pride;</HI> for
<PB N="lxix" REF="77"/>
one certainly may feel grateful to God, that one's Father
was not a Tinker, but a Gentleman, without despising those

<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Any</HI> monarch may make <HI>any</HI> man noble, but he cannot
bestow on him a long train of coronetted ancestors: that
belongs only to the King of kings, who was, as I think,
graciously pleased to cause me to be born the son of Dr.
Berkeley, rather than the son of Tom Smith, my Fa∣ther's
butcher."</Q></P>
<P>It is impossible for the Writer of this Preface not to pay
a small tribute of gratitude to the memory of that uncom∣monly
judicious, amiable, young gentleman, the late Me∣redith
Price, Junior, Esquire; to whose wisdom, prudence,
and humanity, before either had completed his twentieth
<PB N="lxxi" REF="79"/>
year, Mr. Berkeley owed that he was not either a <HI>murderer</HI>
or <HI>murdered.</HI> During their residence at the university of
St. Andrew's, Mr. Berkeley was one day attacked by Mr.
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, a student, (he was <HI>not</HI> a Scotchman,) for an af∣front
that he <HI>supposed</HI> Mr. Berkeley had offered to the fame
of a Distiller's daughter, who resided near St. Andrew's, to
whom, or to whose father's table, Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> paid great
attention. Mr. Berkeley defended himself by declaring,
that, <Q REND="inline">"so far from <HI>speaking</HI> slightingly of the young wo∣man,
he had never even <HI>thought</HI> slightingly of her."</Q> Mr.
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> brutally said, <Q REND="inline">"You say so, because you are a cow∣ard,
and are afraid to fight."</Q> This Mr. Berkeley re∣ceived
very calmly, replying, <Q REND="inline">"G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, those who have
known me through life will never say <HI>that</HI> of me."</Q>
(When a youth, it used to be said of Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"He
fears <HI>nothing</HI> but God and his own Mother.")</Q> Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> then
proceeded, <Q REND="inline">"I may say whatever I please to <HI>you;</HI> for
you dare not challenge me, through fear of your Mother's
displeasure. She <HI>never</HI> would forgive you if you fought
a duel."</Q> This dastardly <HI>vaut-rien</HI> was mistaken; for,
Mrs. Berkeley's horror of those <HI>wretched</HI> parents who can
<HI>cast off</HI> a child for ANY crime that fallen man or <HI>woman</HI>
can commit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very idea of casting off, or deserting any creature that one has been the means of bringing into this world—leaving them entirely to the air, and the prince of the power of the air—is <HI>replete with horror.</HI> That it is not like our heavenly Father, ALL must see and feel.</NOTE> was so strong, that, from Mr. Berkeley's age
<PB N="lxxii" REF="80"/>
of fifteen, his Mother used frequently to say to him, <Q REND="inline">"May
God give you grace to grow up an excellent honest wor∣thy
young man; but always remember, that there is <HI>no</HI>
crime you can commit that shall ever make <HI>me</HI> desert
you; and if you should become extravagant, whilst ever
I have a guinea you shall have eighteen shillings of it;
and I am sure, whilst ever you have one, you would
give me twenty out of it."</Q> Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> might with
equal justice have added, <Q REND="inline">"your Father;"</Q> for, Dr. Berke∣ley's
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the matter becoming public, Dr. Berkeley said to his son, <Q REND="inline">"You ought to have cut the matter short, by saying, that let his father have gotten any sum by <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, it was certainly beneath your dignity as a gentleman to fight with the son of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, and not have <HI>degraded</HI> yourself by sending a challenge to the <HI>son</HI> of G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>."</Q> Dr. Berkeley and his Father the Bishop, both felt pleasure, without pride, in their VERY antient noble descent.</NOTE> <HI>horror</HI> of that BARBAROUS custom of duelling was
at least equal to Mrs. Berkeley's, although he might
not perhaps so frequently descant upon the subject. This
last outrage was too much for Mr. Berkeley. It roused
<Q REND="inline">"all the noble blood of the Berkeleys in his veins."</Q> He
left the room, went home, immediately retired to his
apartment, wrote, and sent the challenge. His next care
was to pitch upon a second. He determined it should not
be his dear friend Mr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, lest it should embroil
him with his excellent noble Father Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. That
young gentleman used to say to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I do not
know how to forgive Berkeley's <HI>not</HI> calling upon <HI>me</HI> on
that occasion, I who have received so many amiable, kind
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="81"/>
attentions from him and his family."</Q> Mr. Berkeley went
to a gentleman, one of his companions at Eton, to whom
he had been particularly attached from twelve years old,
and who had manifold more obligations than Mr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>;
he was many months an inmate at Dr. Berkeley's. On
Mr. Berkeley's requesting him to attend him the next
morning, he hummed a little while, and at length stam∣mered
out, <Q REND="inline">"That he was afraid whether or no his <HI>papa</HI>
might approve of it; so begged his <HI>dear</HI> Berkeley would
<HI>excuse him.</HI>"</Q> Why his Father should disapprove it,
puzzled all who knew his character: it could not be on ac∣count
of breaking God's holy law; for, Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> would
become wretched if he supposed any body suspected him of
believing in God: indeed the conduct of this <HI>fine</HI> Mr.
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> towards his lady and children has evidently proved
it. The description of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, in <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>shire, where
his great estate lies, is this, <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>first</HI> time you are in
company with him, you are charmed; the <HI>second,</HI> you
like him much less; and the <HI>third,</HI> you long to kick him
out of the room—as he deserves."</Q> Mr. Berkeley resolved
not to call on any friend, English or Scottish, whose for∣tunes
it might injure, the certain consequence being expul∣sion
from the university; went to Mr. Price, who owed no
obligation of any sort, except permission to attend the ser∣vice
of the Church of England at Dr. Berkeley's private
chapel; and of course being sometimes invited to a din∣ner,
supper, or dance, in common with other English
<PB N="lxxiv" REF="82"/>
and Scottish young gentlemen. Mr. Price instantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"He was entirely at Mr. Berkeley's service; but hoped
the matter might be accommodated without fighting."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley assured him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that was impossible.</HI>"</Q> They
therefore proceeded to the place, where this wise young
gentleman again urged the matter so sensibly, so eloquently,
that Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> offered to make any submission that Mr.
Berkeley should require. Mr. Berkeley from his infancy,
although a little fury, was surely the most ready to pardon
of all the fallen children of Adam; insomuch that his Mo∣ther
used to say, <Q REND="inline">"That if any one murdered him, and he
lived only three minutes, he would <HI>freely</HI> forgive them;"</Q>
constantly adding, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! he does not inherit that from
<HI>me.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley, however, was so exasperated at the
brutal rascality of, <Q REND="inline">"I may say whatever I please, for you
DARE not fight,"</Q> &amp;c. that for once he appeared inexora∣ble.
The ground was measured, the pistols were delivered,
and the swords laid ready, when Mr. Price, instead of
giving the word to fire, stepped in between the combatants,
and so wisely, so pathetically conjured Mr. Berkeley to ac∣cept
Mr. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s offers of making <HI>every</HI> submission, that,
at length, Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted sweetness, threw
away his pistol, and said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, you shall beg
my pardon in no other way than saying, in Mr. Price's
presence, before the gentlemen in whose company you
insulted me, that you are sorry you provoked me."</Q> So
this frightful affair ended. But not the gratitude of Mr.
<PB N="lxxv" REF="83"/>
Berkeley and his parents. Providence had placed Mr.
Price in a situation to render other return than polite and
friendly attentions out of the question. When Mr. Price
went to France, they felt unfeigned pleasure in giving him
letters of introduction to several very worthy French fami∣lies
with whom they were intimate, which rendered his
<HI>séjour</HI> in that once delightful country very pleasant. May
that amiable young gentleman be now rejoicing in one still
pleasanter!</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be asked by some, <Q REND="inline">"With all these
amiable qualities, and great virtues, had Mr. Berkeley
no vices?"</Q> Alas! yes. Mr. Berkeley fell, as David
fell<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is no history through the whole Bible that affords more <HI>diversion</HI> to the pert, ignorant, young <HI>sucking</HI> Atheist, than the lamentable fall of David. But let such <HI>poor</HI> wits remember what God says to David by Nathan, <Q REND="inline">"Because by <HI>this</HI> deed thou hast given great occasion to the <HI>enemies</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> to <HI>blas∣pheme,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c. God foresaw the <HI>wit</HI> of these geniuses; but let them remember the <HI>title</HI> bestowed on them, <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>enemies</HI> of the <HI>Lord;</HI>"</Q> for the <HI>friends</HI> of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> must ever feel for the subsequent sufferings of David through the whole remain∣der of his life. His children, guilty of incest, murder, horrid deceit, and re∣bellion, punished him even to his extreme old age.</P>
<P>It is impossible here to avoid relating an anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's celebrated learned grandfather.</P>
<P>Bishop Berkeley, walking down Pall Mall, with his darling friend Bishop Benson (whom he used to call Titus, <Q REND="inline">"the delight of human kind,"</Q>) there rushed out of the Star and Garter four or five <HI>very witty bucks</HI> of that day. One exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"A brace of Bishops!" (the bishops then wore purple coats:) "let us put them up."</Q> Bishop Benson, being a much lighter man than Bishop Berkeley, instantly ran off to the opposite side of the way. The Wits immedi∣ately made a circle, and inclosed poor Bishop Berkeley, whom they thus <HI>wit∣tily</HI> accosted, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, my Lord, what does your Lordship think of King Da∣vid? David loved a pretty girl, my Lord."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, I think that King David was a <HI>very great sinner,</HI> as <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> are; but God gave him grace to repent of his sin, as, <HI>I sincerely hope,</HI> he will to YOU and ME."</Q> They all slank off, like <HI>pitiful fools,</HI> excepting one, who said, <Q REND="inline">"I humbly, heartily be your Lordship's pardon."</Q></P>
<P>The same very ready and pointed wit Mr. Berkeley shewed on a dif∣ferent occasion. When introduced to the late Lord Mansfield by his Lord∣ship's desire, he eyed him about half a minute; when Mr. Berkeley expected him to say, what many lords and learned men had often said to him, <Q REND="inline">"that they were happy to see the grandson of their excellent old Friend,"</Q> Lord
Mansfield said,
<Q>"To Berkeley every virtue under heaven."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley instantly replied,<Q>"How sweet an Ovid was in Murray lost."</Q>
Lord Mansfield said, <Q REND="inline">"You are, Sir, a very polite young gentleman, indeed. Aye, Sir, Mr. Pope was very partial to me;"</Q> took Berkeley under the arm, and walked off with him. All Tunbridge talked of Mr. Berkeley's ready wit. Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends, on hearing it, said to him, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, we are afraid the old Prelate was a Forestaller, and has left none of these VIRTUES to you."</Q></P></NOTE>—as Solomon fell;—but, <HI>with them,</HI> he received
grace <PB N="lxxvi" REF="84"/> to repent, and mercy to console his throughly
humbled, penitent, contrite spirit. Mr. Berkeley had not sufficiently
attended to that admonition of the Wise King,
<Q REND="inline">"Use not much the company of a woman that is a
singer."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's enthusiastic love of music drew him into
the <PB N="lxxvii" REF="85"/> snares of the celebrated Mrs.
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. His delight in real sterling wit
caused him to fall into the
<Q REND="inline">"deep ditch"</Q> <HI>long</HI> digging for him by Lady
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. From both it pleased the great
MERCY of God to rescue him. For more than four years before his death, his
lovely spirit was supplicating for that pardon promised by our
all-gracious Redeemer to ALL who turn to him in faith—<Q REND="inline">"Him that cometh unto ME I will in no wise cast out."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley, reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other
advan∣tages, considered himself as a much greater sinner than any of his
young friends, who had not been so favoured by Providence, could possibly
be. But it pleased the God of Mercy to speak peace to his wounded spirit;

<Q REND="inline">"I have heard thy prayer; I have seen thy tears,"</Q>
Isaiah xxxviii. 5; and, for some weeks before his death, to pour the balm
of perfect peace into his dear wounded spirit, and most gra∣ciously to
<Q REND="inline">"lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon
him."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley had too strong an understanding not to be∣lieve
with his <HI>whole</HI> heart and mind the truths, the <HI>blessed</HI>
truths, revealed in the Gospel of Peace. He was blessed
with an <HI>honest</HI> mind, as has been said of a very great man
still living, as much Mr. Berkeley's superior in years as in
rank. <Q REND="inline">"His Lordship is <HI>too</HI> honest to endeavour to warp
the Gospel to <HI>his</HI> life, and he <HI>feels</HI> every day that they are
at war; which makes him so ill-tempered, with a won∣derfully
amiable nature; ever <HI>acting</HI> the kindest things,
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="86"/>
ever <HI>speaking</HI> the roughest."</Q> There Mr. Berkeley resem∣bled
<HI>not</HI> the noble Peer; for he was never known from a
child to say a disobliging thing to any one. So attached to
him was every servant he ever had from the age of seven∣teen,
as that, to use a common phrase, <Q REND="inline">"they would have
gone through fire and water for him:"</Q> even the poor
creature whom he took from his Grace of Bedford, after
his beloved Scotch servant married—who now lives most
happily with a much beloved, honoured, and respected re∣lation
of Mr. Berkeley's, the polite, the accomplished, the
learned Sir Francis Lumm, Baronet; for whose kind, un∣wearied,
watchful, attentions to Mr. Berkeley, from his
first return to England, Mr. Berkeley, his Father, and Mo∣ther,
ever felt, the survivor still feels, the deepest gratitude—this
poor creature one night robbed Mr. Berkeley in the
Temple. On his being pressed to appear against him, he
<HI>absolutely</HI> refused. When strongly urged that it was <HI>right,</HI>
he replied, <Q REND="inline">"It <HI>must</HI> be so, to be sure, to hang a poor devil,
who might have murdered me; for we were in the cham∣bers
alone, and he only took my watch and a few gui∣neas.
No, I hope he may live to repent. Poor crea∣ture!
I am sure <HI>I</HI> will never appear <HI>against</HI> him: I wish
I could appear <HI>for</HI> him."</Q></P>
<P>The present Earl of E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, when a <HI>very</HI> young man,
was robbed on Salisbury Plain by the famous Dumas, after∣wards
executed at Oxford. His Lordship, with the usual
<PB N="lxxix" REF="87"/>
spirit of <HI>nineteen,</HI> was resolved not to be robbed. Dumas
demanded his watch and money. Out sprang his Lordship:
down jumped Dumas: Lord P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, as he then was, at∣tempted
to fire; his pistol would not go off. He threw it
down, and had recourse to the second, which likewise
flashed in the pan. Dumas then said, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are in
my power: you will be pleased to give me your watch
and money."</Q> The request was complied with. In a
short time Dumas was taken, committed to Fisherton gaol,
and tried. Lord P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> was subpoenaed to appear. His
Lordship's purse was produced. He said, <Q REND="inline">"He could not
say that was his purse."</Q> Then the watch: his Lordship
could not say the watch was his. The seals, arms, crest,
&amp;c. were produced; but his Lordship said, <Q REND="inline">"It was im∣possible
for him to <HI>swear</HI> to them."</Q> On being asked by
his friends, when he came out of court, <Q REND="inline">"if he had <HI>lost his
wits,</HI> not to know his own arms, crest,"</Q> &amp;c. he nobly re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"Know them? to be sure I do. But do you think
I would take away the life of a poor distressed creature,
who had <HI>my</HI> life in his power, and would not hurt a hair
of my head?"</Q> It was immediately said that Lord P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> was
become a Methodist—an high compliment surely to
the Methodists. It is not likely that a follower of that arch∣hypocrite,
John Wesley, should have acted thus, unless
some pelf or plunder was to be obtained thereby; at least
if they resembled their wretched leader, whose practice was
<PB N="lxxx" REF="88"/>
to fleece the rich, to feather, <HI>finely</HI> feather, harlots and
rogues. Witness poor Mr. and Mrs. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> ths, of C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,
who, were induced to turn their house into a kind of Lock
Hospital, until they had no house left in which to shelter
their aged heads, only a two pair of stairs lodging in Lon∣don.
On their first acquaintance with the ZEALOUS apostle
of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> they kept a carriage, and a pair of good horses
to draw it, a coachman, footman, and several female ser∣vants.
A few years reduced them to the situation above
described. A letter written by Mrs. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ths, from the
London garret, to a lady at C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, describing their suf∣ferings,
was sufficient to have distressed any hearer of it.
But it was of a piece with his setting Miss B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t, with
fifty thousand pounds, to wash her own linen, that young
harlots might be healed of their bodily diseases, and dressed
out to draw in poor deluded young men to marry them.
One of the nymphs thus restored to health at Mrs.
G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ths's was actually married to a person in London,
who settled on her a jointure of three hundred pounds <HI>per
annum.</HI> Such were the good works of John Wesley!
May his followers cease to practise them! One does not
find them recommended in Scripture. St. Paul says,
<Q REND="inline">"Charge them that are rich, that they be ready to distri∣bute,
willing to communicate,"</Q> &amp;c.; not turn themselves
into washer-women, and retire to garrets, with their poor,
blind, lame, deluded husbands, as did Mrs. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxi" REF="89"/>
But to return. To say that Mr. Berkeley's servants
loved him, is too feeble an expression. His own, and the
servants of his Father's family, in general old in his service,
almost idolized him. His generosity, his condescending
goodness to the meanest servant in the house, was so en∣gaging,
that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he
visited at his Father's. He had been very early taught,
that, although it had pleased Providence to place him in a
different station of life from his Father's servants, yet that
he must ever treat them with kind civility. He and his
brother were always made, whilst children, to take off their
hat to the lowest peasant and washer-woman who passed
them in the village: and so habitual was it to Mr. Berkeley
to be <Q REND="inline">"<HI>courteous to all men,</HI>"</Q> that when he gave orders to
his servant, a stranger to him would not have supposed he
had been speaking to his own domestic; yet, wonderful to
relate, he had one servant, who actually had a desire to
lie in wait to murder him: but he was an Italian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. xxxvii.</NOTE>. This
may be a warning to English and Irish gentlemen to be less
fond of foreign servants. Mr. Berkeley, wanting a servant
at a time when few were in London; a person who owed
Mr. Berkeley much gratitude earnestly recommended this
villain. Mr. Berkeley objected, wishing either an English
or Scotchman; always thinking it wrong to employ fo∣reigners
to the detriment of our own countrymen, he how∣ever
yielded. Dr. Berkeley, at his return from visiting
his son in town, said to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I think your son
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="90"/>
seems to have got a Devil in the form of a fine tall fel∣low."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"What does he do?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Nothing, I believe.
But such a pair of diabolical eyes I never saw before in
my life."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, ever anxious for her idol, wrote
to her son, who, with his usual benignity, replied, <Q REND="inline">"The
poor fellow, to be sure, is not handsome; nor has he a
very benign countenance; which made my Father think
him diabolical: but he does every thing that I want,
although he is not like Ritchie, or M'Nicol."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley was once ordered to the sea, a day
or or two before he set out, accompanied by his excellent
unwearied friend H. Grimston, Esquire, he told this ser∣vant,
that, <Q REND="inline">"as he wished to lounge and change his pos∣ture
frequently, and as he could not accommodate
three in the chaise, it being summer time, he should
go down on the top of the coach."</Q> This <HI>Signor</HI> re∣sented,
as <HI>such</HI> an indignity, that, on his arrival, he
utterly refused to act at all; so that, but for Mr. Grim∣ston's
servant, Mr. Berkeley must have been exceed∣ingly
distressed. His ill humour increasing daily, Mr.
Berkeley at length discharged him without the least anger
or reproach. The sweetness of his nature never suffered
his anger to rise against an inferior. My superiors, he used
ever to say, shall <HI>feel</HI> it if <HI>they</HI> treat me improperly. This
wretch, instead of returning to London the next morning,
stayed the whole of the next day, and when he did set off,
said, <Q REND="inline">"He had waited all that day to murder his master,
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="91"/>
but he found it was in vain, for that he kept close."</Q> It
providentially happened, that Mr. Berkeley's horse had
picked up a nail, and he could not ride into the country,
as was his constant custom, to drink milk from the cow,
morning and evening; neither did he go to the library or
rooms that day; which Mr. Berkeley, when mentioning it,
looked upon as the mercy of an all-gracious, over-ruling,
particular Providence, in which he ever believed, ever
trusted, and was never disappointed. Mr. Berkeley, not
having any Italian blood in his veins, could form no idea
of this villain's spirit of revenge. He was immediately re∣placed
by a very worthy honest Englishman, Mr. William
Morfey, for whose attentive, incessant care Mr. Berkeley
felt himself so much indebted, that some little time before
his lamented death, he requested of his Father and Mother,
<Q REND="inline">"that he might remain in their family as long as service
should be agreeable to him,"</Q> although he had a compe∣tency
without it.</P>
<P>It is almost impossible to avoid relating here a little
circumstance, that will shew the contrast between the En∣glishman
and the Italian. For some time before Mr. Berke∣ley's
dissolution, finding himself unable to fit up through
the day, he rose not until after the family had dined, that
he might enjoy the society of his friends in the afternoon.
He constantly dismissed his servant to eat his dinner in com∣fort,
ordering him not to hurry himself, and not to return
until he rang his bell. One day his bell rang, and Mr.
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="92"/>
Berkeley's Mother, conceiving that the servant had not
dined, went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and told the
servant, she would go up and see what his Master wanted,
and if she could not get it, ring for him. He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Madam, I must go myself."</Q> The housekeeper and
the other servants urged him to stay, saying, <Q REND="inline">"You have
but <HI>one single</HI> mouthful to finish; do pray eat it; Mr.
Berkeley is never impatient, he will wait."</Q> He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No; I will not stay to eat it.</HI>"</Q> His Mother once recom∣mending
to his care a most affectionate, tender-hearted
servant, her old housekeeper, who came into the family
when Mr. Berkeley was a lad, to keep in his family, if it
pleased God to spare him to settle; he lifted up his fine
eyes, and replied, in the tenderest tone of voice, <Q REND="inline">"My
dearest Mother, there is no occasion for <HI>you</HI> to recom∣mend
Mrs. Marsh to <HI>me.</HI>"</Q> When Mr. Berkeley's ex∣quisitely
fine picture, presented to his Mother by his
beloved friend Mr. Peters, arrived at Dr. Berkeley's, this
amiable-hearted woman hastened to assist at the unpacking
it, and, on seeing it, sunk motionless upon it. Heartfelt grati∣tude
forces the Writer of this Preface to celebrate the incessant
unwearied attention of the two above named servants, as
also of the very worthy Mrs. Jane Godwin, who has for
many years been the happy domestic of Mr. Berkeley's in∣comparably
kind, generous, excellent Aunt, Mrs. Frin∣sham,
for the delightful alacrity, and unwearied assiduity,
with which they endeavoured incessantly to alleviate Mr.
Berkeley's intolerable, <HI>all but insupportable,</HI> bodily sufferings,
<PB N="lxxxv" REF="93"/>
as indeed did every other servant in the family: for all
which sufferings Mr. Berkeley repeatedly returned hearty
thanks to God, frequently saying to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I would
not have been without them for all this world has to
give, as, I am persuaded, nothing short of what I have
suffered could have brought <HI>me,</HI> as I <HI>ought,</HI> to come to
Christ"</Q> Such universal benevolence may tempt the pos∣sessor
to feel less need of the atonement.</P>
<P>It is impossible to omit here my most grateful acknow∣ledgements
to many amiable-hearted persons in the inferior
stations in life, to whom Mr. Berkeley was only known by
his almost divine philanthropy, and by his severe sufferings—at
Hastings, at Dover, and at Cheltenham—who seemed to
vie with each other, who should be most active in <HI>endeavour∣ing</HI>
to lighten the distress of a poor miserable stomach, that
for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley frequently, for days together, did not retain any thing taken into his stomach for one minute; which occasioned one of the most emi∣nent Physicians to pronounce positively, that the passage into the stomach was stopped, and must be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen. This was not the case; as sometimes, for two or three days successively, plainly ap∣peared. Mr. Berkeley was one of the most temperate of men, never, from the age of fifteen, tasting a morsel of any food between his meals; no sand∣wich; no soup; nor any thing else, even if he did not dine until six o'clock; and very rarely ate any supper when he dined at the old-fashioned hour of three at his Father's house.</NOTE>.
Persons are often punished in kind.—<Q REND="inline">"By what things a
man sinneth, by the same also shall he be tormented,"</Q>
speaks the Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="lxxxvi" REF="94"/>
Mr. Berkeley never was an epicure a moment of his life;
frequently, when the family dined out, and he did not
choose to accompany them, Mrs. Berkeley would ask him,
<Q REND="inline">"What she should order for his dinner?"</Q> His constant re∣ply
was, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam, whatever they have in
the servants' hall will do for me."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But, my dear, they
have not any thing yet ordered."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well, then, if it is
quite convenient, a neck of mutton and broth, and suet
dumplings, and turnips;"</Q> of which he constantly ate the
absolute scrag; which often occasioned his mother's telling
him, <Q REND="inline">"However you may torment your wife, if ever you
marry, it will not be as an epicure."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley wished exceedingly to have gone to Dover
immediately, on his being ordered the third time to the
sea, that, together with sea bathing, he might have enjoyed
the delightful society of his old, his beloved, his sincerely
respected friends, the excellent Sir Robert and Lady Lau∣rie,
and their throughly amiable son and daughter; but
his father wished him to make choice of Hastings; and Mr.
Berkeley was the <HI>most</HI> obedient of sons. As the autumn
advanced, the want of a warm sea-bath obliged him to quit
Hastings, and he repaired to Dover, accompanied by his
excellent relation above named, Mrs. Frinsham; where he
received such amiable, such incessant attentions, from the
lovely family of Laurie, the angelic Mrs. Firebrace, and
the very worthy Mrs. and Miss Payne—although it were
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="95"/>
impossible, even if possessed of the mines of Peru and
Mexico, to repay their kindness, yet must it ever be, whilst
possessed of life, registered in the retentive grateful memory
of the Editor; and may HE who rewardeth <HI>every one ac∣cording
to, although not for,</HI> their good works, reward these
amiable friends an hundred, a thousand fold, in TIME, and
through the countless ages of ETERNITY, is a prayer offered
<HI>daily</HI> at the throne of that God who <HI>hears</HI> and <HI>answers</HI> prayer,
as is often happily experienced by those who <HI>believe</HI> and
<HI>trust</HI> HIS gracious promises, revealed in the Holy Scriptures.
The mention of these particular kind, old, intimate friends
of Mr. Berkeley and his family, does not prevent the
Writer from feeling the sincerest gratitude to numberless
other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of Dover,
who, high and low, seemed to study who should be most
forward in shewing every <HI>possible</HI> attention to Mr. Berkeley,
so much as frequently at this time to occasion the above
named worthy domestics to say, <Q REND="inline">"they never saw such de∣lightful
people as the inhabitants of Dover."</Q> It has been
repeatedly asserted many years ago by the Writer, who
has often bathed in the sea at Dover, that the inhabitants,
even the very lowest ranks, were certainly the most cour∣teous
people in Europe, and attributed it to their vicinity
to their once amiable, delightfully courteous neighbours
on the other side of the water. The streets of Dover are
narrow, of course the pavement cannot be wide; and so
<HI>very</HI> attentive are they, that you never see an inferior
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="96"/>
take the wall of a superior, or a charity-school child of an
elder person. If, looking on the other side, a bricklayer's
labourer in a leathern apron stumble on any lady or gentle∣man,
he instantly steps off the narrow pavement with, <Q REND="inline">"I
ask your pardon, Sir, or Madam, for not seeing you
were coming."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's father used to say, <Q REND="inline">"They
remind me of the days of my youth, spent in Ireland,
where the inferior people are most remarkably respectful
to their superiors."</Q></P>
<P>It would be a vain effort to attempt doing justice to Mr.
Berkeley's gratitude to the excellent Mr. Brydges, of
Wootton Court, and his accomplished lady; at Dover, at
the time Mr. Berkeley was there. He used to exclaim,
<Q REND="inline">"How often have they driven over to Wootton Court, to
fetch me some fine fruit, as if I had been only brother
to both."</Q> Fruit fit to eat, indeed any fruit, cannot be
procured for any sum at Dover: and on fruit, sweetmeats,
and old hock, did Mr. Berkeley long subsist. After his ar∣rival
at Cheltenham, how many fervent prayers did he pour
forth to the Almighty, to reward the throughly amiable
relations of his Mother, Sir John and Lady Guise; when a
servant arrived loaded with the fine fruits of Highnam Court,
as also the amiable highly respected old friend of his Mo∣ther,
Mr. De la Bere, of Cheltenham, in whose pleasing
conversation Mr. Berkeley much delighted, during the few
weeks of his life after his arrival at Cheltenham; whither
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="97"/>
he went, in compliance with the wishes of his Mother, to
enjoy the advice of the celebrated Dr. Chestern, of Glou∣cester.
But, alas! Mr. Berkeley fell a victim to duty! He
had for near two years before been under the hands of an hy∣pocritical
IGNORAMUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Editor wishes for the pen of a Johnson, or a Burke, to endeavour to do justice to her gratitude to that most amiable of men, her respected friend, William Sharp, Esquire, of Fulham, who having, as it appeared, <HI>wrenched</HI> himself from his patients, from his extensive practice, has the goodness to at∣tend to the maladies of his friends. Dr. Berkeley being from home for a few nights, Mrs. Berkeley instantly dispatched a letter to Mr. Sharp, conjuring him to permit her Son to wait on him, she being convinced that he was in a very dangerous situation. The permission was, in the politest manner, more than granted. Mr. Sharp, most amiably writing to Mrs. Berkeley, said, <Q REND="inline">"I will not give Mr. Berkeley the trouble of coming to Fulham; but, if he will be pleased to appoint any place, day, and hour, in town, I will punctually attend."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was too well bred, and felt this amiable goodness too strongly, to accept it: he set out for Fulham; and, on his arrival there, sent his servant to beg to know at what hour it would be agreeable to Mr. Sharp to admit him. On presenting to Mr. Sharp a short letter of introduction from his Mother (Mr. Berkeley having never before seen him) good Mr. Sharp politely exclaimed, from Mrs. Berkeley's letter, <Q REND="inline">"Do all I can to rescue you from the grave, Sir! If I had <HI>no</HI> friendship for Mrs. Berkeley, I would certainly exert all the skill I am master of to rescue from death the finest young gentleman I ever saw."</Q> Alas, it was too late! That healing art, as divine Hervey says of Dr. Ston∣house, to which myself and so many others have been indebted, failed <HI>here.</HI> See Meditations among the Tombs.</P>
<P>On examining Mr. Berkeley, Mr. Sharp exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Into the hands of what ignorant Brute can you have fallen, Sir? Dr. Berkeley resides within thirty miles of town. I did not conceive that, in these days, in the remotest village in England there they had not better medical aid. One fortnight more, and all the men in the world could not have rescued you, and a most direful cala∣mity must have inevitably come upon you."</Q> For ever blessed be the mercy of God on the great skill of good Mr. Sharp, and the eminent Surgeon, an <HI>elève</HI> of his own for fourteen years, under whose care he advised Mr. Berkeley to put himself; that tragical <HI>maiming</HI> of his fine person was averted, although his dear life could only be lengthened, not preserved.</P>
<P>Some years ago, the late amiable, pious Mrs. Wadham Knatchbull, having a disorder that baffled the skill of several very good Canterbury surgeons, her excel∣lent son, Wyndham Knatchbull, Esquire, prevailed on Mr. Sharp to visit her, after he had retired from practice. During his stay at the house of his excellent rela∣tion, Dr. Dering, Prebendary of Canterbury, he very obligingly wrote a pre∣scription for a snuff for Mrs. George Berkeley's eyes. To that gentleman's great skill, when in practice fifteen years before, she, under God, owes it, that, after having nursed a child too long, she has still, through mercy, one eye left, to scribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors, her sympa∣thizing friends. Mrs. Berkeley, one morning, carried the prescription herself to Dr. Berkeley's respected surgeon, Mr. Loftie, desiring him to make it up himself, mentioning from whom she had it, acknowledging, as above, that she owed to that gentleman's skill that she had still <HI>one</HI> eye. Mr. Loftie exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Then, Madam, <HI>you</HI> know Mr. Sharp."</Q> I never in my life beheld such another man. Good God! with what tenderness, ease, and skill, did he did perform the operation on Mrs. Knatchbull! I never, never saw his equal. <Q REND="inline">"Be∣sides, Madam, he is as well-bred a gentleman, as he is an excellent sur∣geon."</Q></P></NOTE>, in whom his Father placed great <PB N="xc" REF="98"/> confidence.
His Mother saw through the wretch; and what added to her anguish was, that
two, perhaps, as skilful me∣dical men as any in England resided at the
same town; one of whom always attended Mr. Berkeley's Mother when ill, as
she frequently declared to Dr. Berkeley that to <HI>the third</HI> she
would not trust the life of her Angola cat.</P>
<P><PB N="xci" REF="99"/>
God's ways are unsearchable; but they are all well or¦dered
for his children, who are enabled to <HI>feel,</HI> as well as
<HI>say,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"All thy ways are Mercy and Truth,"</Q> &amp;c. Perhaps
few situations have been more distressing than that of Mr.
Berkeley's Mother for many weeks. Just at the time when
she should have set out to attend her Son at Dover,
her tenderly beloved Partner was seized at Cheltenham
with a most tremendous disorder, that threatened almost
immediate dissolution. Every post brought more alarming
accounts from Dover—<Q><L>—"Dreadful post of observation,</L>
<L>"Darker every hour,"</L></Q>
says Dr. Young, when relating his own sufferings during
Lady Betty's last illness. Her agonies every time the post∣boy's
horn notified his arrival may, by those who have
feeling hearts, be more easily imagined than described,
and especially as they were obliged to be suppressed. It,
however, pleased the mercy of God to grant a reprieve—a short one, alas! to these two, <HI>too</HI> dear objects. Mr.
Berkeley languished to see once more his Mother; Per∣haps
no Mother ever did love a Son quite so sincerely; and
it was supposed by those who knew him well, that no man
ever did love even a Mother so exceedingly as Mr. Berke∣ley<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Holy Spirit certainly holds out the love between Mother and Son as the highest love without passion. Solomon, speaking of Wisdom, saith, <Q REND="inline">"She shall love thee more than thy Mother doth;"</Q> and David says, <Q REND="inline">"I went hea∣vily, as one that mourneth for his Mother."</Q> And again, the Holy Spirit, describing the <HI>bitterest</HI> mournings, says, <Q REND="inline">"It shall be as the mourning for an only Son."</Q></NOTE>. That love commenced, as Mrs. Berkeley used to tell
<PB N="xcii" REF="100"/>
her Son, <Q REND="inline">"the instant she saw his dear <HI>homely face;</HI>"</Q> and
continued unabated—alas! daily increased—until his fine
face was for ever hid from her bodily eyes by the arrival
of the Plumber late on Saturday evening preceding his
interment on the Sunday evening. God, in love, in
mercy, <HI>must</HI> remove the <Q REND="inline">"idols <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Prophet Ezekiel: <Q REND="inline">"Son of Man, they have set up their idols in their <HI>heart.</HI>"</Q></NOTE> out of the hearts"</Q> of his
children.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's Mother always flattered herself with the
hope, that as she never spoiled, or improperly gratified her
children, and constantly corrected them, according to the
advice of the Wise King, the Book of Proverbs being her
constant directory, that she did not idolize them: but,
alas! the wisest are too apt to deceive themselves—how
much more then a poor weak Female!</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley's first care for her children was the salva∣tion
of their souls; secondly, the cultivation of their minds
and manners; next, the forming their persons; and, lastly,
<PB N="xciii" REF="101"/>
the advancing her <HI>Son</HI> in his profession, for the youngest
died before he attained to nine years.</P>
<P>When it is mentioned that attention was paid to the
immortal part of Mr. Berkeley even before he was born,
it will be easily imagined, that, as soon as reason began to
dawn, every <HI>judicious</HI> attention was paid to the direction of
the Holy Spirit, delivered by St. Paul, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Bring up your chil∣dren
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI>"</Q> From the
time that his Mother perceived that the all-gracious Giver
of every good gift was about to entrust her with the care of
an immortal soul, that <HI>must</HI> pass the countless ages of eter∣nity,
either in bliss unspeakable, or woe unutterable; she
never failed to pray daily, that nothing descended from her
might ever be separated from that adorable God, who lived
and died, that man might live for ever; and she trusts,
through free sovereign Grace, and Redeeming Love, to be
enabled to say at the great day, <Q REND="inline">"Lo! here am, I and the
children whom thou hast graciously given me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a letter of Mrs. Berkeley's, many months ago in the St. James's Chro∣nicle, combating Dr. Beattie's idea of not permitting children to know that there is a Supreme Being, until they attain to the age of six years; the Editor of the St. James's Chronicle, in general <HI>very</HI> sensible, has rejected this text, as TOO serious for a newspaper, and has adopted a sentence of nonsense. In ano∣ther part, he has sadly turned one period, and mutilated it, for fear of being TOO serious. He apologizes for it in a succeeding paper.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xciv" REF="102"/>
Almost as soon as Mr. Berkeley could articulate, there
was discovered in him, what attended him through life,
wonderful powers of reasoning, and an incessant enquiry
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>How can these things be,</HI>"</Q> and a sagacity that it was next
to impossible to deceive; which once occasioned a sensible
Lady<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, the beloved, the bosom-friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley's Mother from <HI>very</HI> early youth to her latest hour, without any intermission, any coolness, over whose heavy sufferings she cannot avoid dropping a tear. Friends from children; both married just at the same time, within a few weeks; both called upon to <HI>offer up</HI> two beloved children, Mrs. Berkeley two fine sons, Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> two lovely daughters. On the death of the eldest of the two, Miss Ca∣tharine P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> whom Mrs. Berkeley had prevailed on Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> to put, for a couple of years, under the tuition of the accomplished Mrs. Beaver, in Dover Street, being, as both these <HI>very</HI> old fashioned ladies thought, <HI>too young</HI> at between sixteen and seventeen to be <HI>introduced into life,</HI> as it is termed, died very suddenly. Mrs. Berkeley wrote as follows to her beloved friend, after her usual preface, <Q REND="inline">"It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good:"</Q> was added, <Q REND="inline">"I am at a loss what to say to my dearest friend. The subject is diffi∣cult: for, I do <HI>really</HI> believe you have lost <HI>such</HI> a daughter as no other mo∣ther in Europe has to lose."</Q> The astonishing strength and solidity of this young lady's understanding, and the exceeding beauty of her face, and elegance of her form, could only be exceeded by the loveliness of her temper, (cor∣rected at about fourteen by herself,) and the exquisite obligingness, and re∣fined unaffected sweetness of her manners. Some years after Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> lost another lovely daughter; but <HI>she</HI> had still a lovely one remaining, together with a most excellent son and a worthy husband, to soothe <HI>her</HI> sufferings under the total loss of the use of her limbs; all which she bore with true Christian resig∣nation. It was somewhat remarkable that from her age of eighteen she had al∣ways told the Editor, that she was very certain that God would, some time or other, in mercy, punish her, by taking away the use of her limbs; adding, <Q REND="inline">"I know he <HI>must</HI> do it in <HI>love</HI> to my soul:"</Q> then assigning the reason. Thou art now in bliss, thou beloved friend.</NOTE>, mother of many fine children, to say, <Q REND="inline">"Of what
<PB N="xcv" REF="103"/>
can that little creature's brain be formed? for I never
heard any child ask such very extraordinary questions,
not even at double his age."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was early a great sceptic, which alarmed
his Mother the less, as she felt it was hereditary; and she
pursued the same plan which her eminently pious and wise
Mother had so happily used towards herself; and her en∣deavours
to direct and settle that dangerous tendency of
mind were so happily blessed, that, from the early age of
fifteen, Mr. Berkeley was a most zealous, ardent stickler
for the co-equal co-eternal Godhead of his adored Redeemer,
and of the Holy Spirit, with the Father. A most respecta∣ble
and worthy friend of his early youth, in a letter to
his Mother on the death of his beloved friend, says, <Q REND="inline">"How
often have I heard him in company <HI>battling</HI> for the <HI>ho∣nour</HI>
of his Saviour, and silencing his Deistical acquain∣tance
and friends!"</Q> He had many friends, whom he ear∣nestly
wished to lead out of their infidel <HI>darkness</HI> into the
glorious sunshine of the Gospel of Christ—several of the
great Geniuses of this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley at one time very <HI>earnestly</HI> solicited his Father's permission to recommend a <HI>cottage ornée</HI> in the neighbourhood of Cookham to a friend of his, a man of large fortune, and deserved fame in the literary world, for a sum∣mer residence, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I have no doubt but he would be convinced by your arguments."</Q> To which Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure, if he has not been convinced by <HI>yours,</HI> who are his friend, he will not be convinced by mine."</Q> On Mrs. Berkeley's joining in her Son's supplications, Dr. Berkeley, rather angrily, replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>No, no; he shall not</HI> bring down any of his Deistical friends to <HI>stink</HI> in my nose: he shall <HI>not</HI> come. It is not that they <HI>do</HI> not, but that they <HI>will</HI> not believe the record that God has given of his Son."</Q> So it was of course given up.</NOTE>, who may perhaps affect to
<PB N="xcvi" REF="104"/>
laugh or scoff at this, although they know it to be true,
and that Mr. Berkeley did not wait to believe in the Saviour
of the world, until driven to him by sickness or the ter∣rors
of death.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, when her children were young, and
during their being under their Father's roof, whilst at the
King's School at Canterbury, devoted her mornings prima∣rily
to them, never admitting any morning visitor; which
occasioned the sensible, the witty Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, an old
intimate school friend of hers, frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"I wish
those two nasty little brats were dead out of the way;
then your friends might enjoy a little of your company."</Q>
The jocular wish, alas, is realized. That amiable friend
was very partial to them, perpetually fetching them to
children's card-parties at her hospitable mansion. Mr.
Berkeley, when a man, used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"I love
Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, for her goodness to me when I was a
boy."</Q> Her benevolence was so well known, that all who
did not wish to drown puppies and kittens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As dogs and cats produce their young so frequently and so plentifully, is it not reasonable to suppose, that the bounteous Giver of every good gift, meant these cheaply fed, domestic animals, for food for man, and not to be soused at nine days old into a horse-pond, to corrupt the water for the poor horses and cows? We learn, from high authority, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That God made nothing in vain.</HI>"</Q> These poor animals, as we treat them, seem made <HI>worse</HI> than in vain. We read in Mr. Forster's account of Captain Cook's first voyage, that the life of that very worthy amiable man was supposed to be saved by Mr. Forster's sacrificing his favourite dog, for his food, when very ill; and it is well known that half London, who choose to eat <HI>tame</HI> rabbits, certainly eat cats. It is a pre∣judice which, perhaps, like <HI>most</HI> other prejudices, it would be wisdom to give up. The county of Fife, in some parts, abounds with the finest rabbits, yet the poorest labourer will not eat one, although starving; calling them <HI>carrion:</HI> they kill them, sell their skins, and throw the body to the <HI>smiddie,</HI> (their elegant word for our gross one of <HI>dunghill;</HI>) <HI>we</HI> are rather a coarse people; the French call that necessary heap <HI>un fumée.</HI> Many of the lower people of Scotland will not touch a silver eel, terming water-snakes. When the late Bishop Berkeley went, in the year 1735, to reside in the palace at Cloyne, none of the poor Irish would eat of some very fine fish, in great plenty there, I think, the Jean d'orée; but, after some time, they said, <Q REND="inline">"that if my Lord ate it, it could not <HI>harm</HI> them."</Q></NOTE> used in the
<PB N="xcvii" REF="105"/>
evening to convey them into her garden. Mrs. Berkeley
used to tell her, that <Q REND="inline">"she would advise some poor Clergy∣man
to pack up a child or two in a basket, and lay it at
her hall door."</Q> Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"I de∣clare,
if ever there is a child found in the garden, I will
send it to you to keep."</Q> The generosity of this Lady
needs no eulogium from the pen of an old friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, determined to attempt complying with the
earnest request of his Mother, took an affectionate, a grate∣ful,
<HI>last</HI> farewell of all his amiable friends and obliging
neighbours at Dover, including the throughly respectable
<PB N="xcviii" REF="106"/>
and pious Rev. Mr. Lyon, and his tender-hearted amiable
apothecary, Mr. Hanham, who did not conceive that Mr.
Berkeley had sufficient strength remaining to reach Canter∣bury
alive; but the divine tenderness of nature, which
shewed itself at the age of three years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When about that age, one Wednesday, the family all coming out of church, a beggar applied to her Father for relief, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that a scaffold breaking at Co∣lonel Tyrrel's, at Shottover House, two men had been killed,—his arm was so shattered that it had been cut off just at the elbow,—that it was then morti∣fied, and he was going to the hospital to have it taken off above the elbow."</Q> Mr. Frinsham, an excellent surgeon to his poor neighbours, insisted on looking at it; and, turning to his footman, bid him assist the man to take off his coat. After much apparatus removed, there appeared a lily white hand. Hereupon Mr. Frinsham exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Thou villain! I will commit you to Bridewell di∣rectly. William, (to his servant,) go, call the constable;"</Q> who lived at the parsonage close by;—out came the constable;—down fell the <HI>restored</HI> cripple on his knees on the pitched walk. This lovely little creature flew to her Father, and, clinging round him, said, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Papa, forgive the poor man; he will cut his knees; <HI>he will indeed.</HI>"</Q> Then falling upon her knees, and embracing her Father's, she wept, and shrieked so violently, that, fearing she would be deprived of her reason, the vile impostor was dismissed unpu∣nished. The same sweet spirit has attended her through life; a blessing to the poor and needy, a constant source of suffering to herself. The wretch confessed that his hand had been thus muffled up for the last fourteen years: he appeared to common spectators to have really but half an arm. The coat sleeve was smeared all over with medicine, and the hand confined in the leathern case of a duodecimo Bible.</NOTE> in his angelic relation

reached Canterbury, where he saw some of his old friends.
the very learned Mr. Todd, and some others; and in the
evening sent for Mr. Wrightson, now master of the work∣house
of the sixteen parishes of that city—happy indeed do
both high and low express themselves in so worthy, so mild,
so able a governor.</P>
<P>The learned and accomplished Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> of Cookham
used, when obligingly advising Mr. Berkeley, at the age of
seventeen, to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, if you will not attend to me,
I will speak to Mr. John, and he will make you do it
immediately."</Q> Mr. Berkeley used to redden, and say,
<Q REND="inline">"HE make me do it! How so?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Berke∣ley,
I had not been intimate with your family six weeks
before I saw that he governed the <HI>whole</HI> family."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"The
<HI>whole</HI> family! How so?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, when Dr. or Mrs.
Berkeley say, 'Berkeley, I would advise you to do so or
so,' you instantly reply, 'Yes, Sir, or Madam; but I
must first hear what John says.' Then on some other
subject Dr. Berkeley turns to Mrs. Berkeley, and says,
'My dear, you will speak to John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Highly as Mr. Berkeley thought of John, he is one instance thought more highly of his own eloquence. Sometimes Mr. Berkeley's fine hunter was not thought sufficiently recovered from the fatigues of the preceding hunt; and only one horse in the place was capable of flying over hedge and ditch, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>burn and brake,</HI>"</Q> the property of a most worthy old blacksmith, of the name of Peirce. Mr. Berkeley used to send his own young man (now, through the mercy of God, with Christ); <Q REND="inline">"give my service to Peirce, and desire he will hire me his horse to hunt to-morrow."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Master Peirce's duty to you, Sir, and he is very sorry, but he thinks he shall want him himself."</Q>—Off sets Mr. Berkeley to the gardener, who lives at Maidenhead, a man of very uncommonly strong understanding, much better improved in youth, by a kind relation, than is usual in that rank of life, and who would have educated him a scholar, but for the avarice of his Mother, who said, <Q REND="inline">"John, has had <HI>larning</HI> enough, and "he must now set about <HI>arning,</HI>"</Q> <HI>i.e.</HI> earning—always a most respectful domestic. Down goes the spade or water-pot—off goes the gardener, with the message a little strengthened.—<Q REND="inline">"His Humble duty to you, and he is very sorry; but I cannot spare his horse to-morrow."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"John, pray now do you go to old Peirce, and tell him what distress I am in, and I am sure he will lend me his horse. I will give whatever he desires for him."</Q> Off goes John—returns with as little success as the others. Off sets Mr. Berkeley, and soon returns in triumph, with, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, there is nothing like doing one's own business. Here have I sent Robert, Gardener, John; all in vain; and I prevailed upon the old man in two minutes. He said, 'Lord bless you, Sir, why you <HI>must</HI> have him I think, and I must go to Reading on Thursday."</Q> The fact was, Mr. Berkeley's manners were so uncommonly sweet and winning, particularly to his inferiors, where, as his mother used to tell him, the <Q REND="inline">"noble blood of the Berkeleys"</Q> could not be put in motion, that he could, like his Grandfather, the Bishop (as Mr. Dalton used always to say) of his beloved respected friend he could persuade every body to any thing that he pleased. Some time after, this honest man opened a grocer's shop; Mr. Berkeley conjured his Mother to lay out some money with him, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I really feel myself under great obli∣gations to the honest old man."</Q> On Mr. Berkeley's return to Cookham several years after, finding his old friend Peirce dead, he put his little orphan boy to school.</NOTE>, and hear what he
<PB N="c" REF="108"/>
says;' when Mrs. Berkeley replies, 'Yes, I have talked
to him already about it.' Now is it not evident that
what I say is fact?"</Q> This gentleman did not mean that
Dr. Berkeley consulted his excellent old servant on his Ser∣mons,
or Mrs. Berkeley on her Letters, although she had
<PB N="ci" REF="109"/>
taught him the alphabet; he coming very early into Dr.
Berkeley's family, and living in it very near thirty years,
during which long period he never returned a saucy answer,
nor uttered a pert sentence, or grumble, when shutting the
door. Notwithstanding he was, when Mrs. Berkeley was not
present, the <HI>only</HI> governor of Mr. Monck Berkeley, yet he ne∣ver
forgot that he was the son of his Master; but always treated
him with the respect due from one in an humbler station.
<Q REND="inline">"Sir, you <HI>must not,</HI> you <HI>shall not</HI> do that. What would
my Mistress say, if she should come into the stable-yard
now?"</Q> Mr. Wrightson was many years coachman to
Dr. Berkeley before he became his butler. A stronger proof
that persons is an humble station may be thoroughly re∣spectable
and respected cannot be adduced than in Mr.
Berkeley's little brother, when about seven years old, sit∣ting
very disconsolately: the cause being enquired, he re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, I have been naughty, and John will not
be friends with me."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, his grandmother,
being in the room, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! never mind that, if he
won't; but go away to play."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Never mind it, indeed
Why, if <HI>all</HI> the world were friends with, and <HI>John was
not,</HI> I could never be happy."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Wrightson's powers for governing well, it may be
presumed, are not impaired; as the little <HI>boys</HI> in Canter∣bury
workhouse, of which he is now master, are made so
industrious, at <HI>eight</HI> years old, as to earn money sufficient to
<PB N="cii" REF="110"/>
receive a poundage of threepence every week for themselves,
to spend as they please, in little innocent trifles. A wise en∣couragement
this; and it must be wished by every humane
person, that it was practised in <HI>every</HI> workhouse and poor-house
throughout the three kingdoms. At Cookham in Berk∣shire,
where they are remarkably kind to the poor in the
workhouse, and most shamefully hard and cruel to those
who <HI>strive</HI> to keep themselves out of it, the lace-making
women and girls, and others, have two pence out of every
shilling they earn, and permission to work for their own
profit after a certain hour in the evening. This is com∣forting
the hearts of the poor, enabling them to procure a
little tea, tobacco, and snuff, which cannot be provided
otherwise. Dr. Berkeley has often had his wonderfully
fine, tender, feelings soothed, when visiting sick persons in
the workhouse, saying, on his return home, <Q REND="inline">"Well, it is
a delight to one's spirit to see those poor people in sheets
as white, though not as fine, as one's own, and every
comfort that human aid can render."</Q> Tea, wine, &amp;c.
were always allowed to the sick, if the apothecary said it
was necessary. The very worthy Mrs. Lane was then
mistress, with a handsome salary. She lived many years
in the family of the late Lord Aylesford. Servants, who
have lived in genteel families, are the <HI>only proper</HI> conductors
of workhouses. A butler of the late worthy General Onslow
of Cookham was her predecessor. A <HI>broken</HI> tradesman,
<PB N="ciii" REF="111"/>
who perhaps knows little, but how to give <HI>short measure,</HI>
and light weight, and eat the best of every thing, till he
breaks, is tyrannical and cruel, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>laying his weight heavily
on the aged; and not pitying children;</HI>"</Q> as speaks the Holy
Scripture.</P>
<P>The aid of the very learned, very skilful Dr. Packe had
been procured by Mrs. Berkeley, who, in a letter sent to
him by her, had desired him to visit Mr. Berkeley at Do∣ver,
which he did, and saw him again at Canterbury on
his journey. It was supposed by all who did see him, that
Mr. Berkeley would hardly reach Sittingbourn alive; and
he was supposed once to be dead; yet it pleased that all∣gracious
God, whose mercies are no fewer than infinite, to
his faithful, however unworthy, servants, to conduct Mr.
Berkeley to Cheltenham, where his family had been for
some months, unable to get to him, on account of his Fa∣ther's
lamentable state of health, as above mentioned. Mr.
Berkeley, after reposing part of a day and a night at the
palace of those prodigies of KENTISH innkeepers, Mr. and
Mrs. Simpson, at the Rose at Sittingbourn—indeed they
might, with truth, be compared with the Marches at Mai∣denhead
Bridge; the Red Lion, Henley; and most of the
great innkeepers on the Northern Road; whose accommo∣dations,
obliging assiduities, and reasonable charges, de∣serve
to be celebrated.</P>
<P><PB N="civ" REF="112"/>
Mr. Berkeley, by slow journeys, reached the metropolis,
where he rested two or three days, and collected all those
few friends who happened to be in town at that season
when London is usually most empty, the beginning of De∣cember.
He exhibited himself as a man dying in the very
prime of life, and besought them to <Q REND="inline">"<HI>remember their Crea∣tor
before the evil days come on,</HI>"</Q> and to fly from tempta∣tion.
He afterwards proceeded to his Father's house at
Cookham; in the garden of which he ever delighted so
much, particularly in the Southcote Walk leading to the
Thames, as often to say to his Mother, who admired it at
least as much as her Son, <Q REND="inline">"Well, if I was Lord Chancel∣lor,
and could not get the vicar's garden at Cookham,
I should be perpetually breaking the tenth command∣ment."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley had written to <HI>her</HI> apothecary, the very
sensible and skilful Mr. Falwasser of Maidenhead, to desire
him to meet Mr. Berkeley at Cookham, and endeavour to
administer something to alleviate his sufferings, during his
journey at least. After a short rest at Cookham, he left
his beloved relation, Mrs. Frinsham, so exhausted with
tender anxiety, as to be unable then to prosecute her jour∣ney
to Cheltenham. He proceeded with his attentive ser∣vant
to Oxford, whither he had written to his bedmaker,
and kind attentive nurse in a severe stage of his near five

years' illness, Mrs. Leycester<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some time after Mr. Monck Berkeley's death, the family passing through Oxford, this very worthy, grateful woman came to Mrs. Berkeley with a small box under her arm, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that she knew not what it contained; but that whenever Mr. Berkeley quitted Oxford for any length of time, he constantly gave it her, with a strict charge to lock it up carefully, and never whilst he was living to deliver it into any hand but his own; in case of his death, to his Mother."</Q> It contained some very curious letters from some of his inti∣mate friends; one very curious one from R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, the contents of which still remain known only to the Editor; two or three rings and coins; <HI>souvenirs</HI> of departed friends; a curious purse containing several strips cut out of newspapers: on examination they were found to be accounts of the deaths of various friends, thus preserved, as mementos, from the time that he was a school-boy; and a card, quite yellowed by time, containing the lines, not at last rightly quoted by Mr. S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> in his Anecdotes from Aaron Hill's fine tragedy, which, Dr. Johnson said, <Q REND="inline">"merited to be written in letters of gold,"</Q> and which Mrs. Berkeley had caused her son to get by heart as soon as they were commented upon in Davies's Life of David Garrick, Esquire.<Q>"Oh! Leoline, as obstinately just," &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>While Mr. Berkeley was at Eton, his Mother said to him, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you have not forgotten the delightful lines of Aaron Hill."</Q> He instantly repeated them, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I wish you would be so good as to write them out for me on a card."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why so? you remember them perfectly."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes; so I do; and hope never to forget them. But, I think, if I saw them now and then, in (what he po∣litely termed) your beautiful hand, they would make a <HI>deeper</HI> impression on my mind."</Q> The request was of course complied with, and on the reverse of the card two important texts of Scripture written. The card, written about fourteen years before, was found deposited in this box.</P></NOTE>, to procure him a lodging as near the Hall as she could; as Mr.
Berkeley, the Hall being full, was obliged, when more than four years
standing in the University, to relinquish his rooms to admit younger
members.</P>
<P><PB N="cvi" REF="114"/>
It is impossible to omit relating here a most pleasing
grateful attention of a much younger gentleman than Mr.
Berkeley, over whom Mr. Berkeley had most kindly and
wisely watched, in order to prevent his forming, as youths
of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen, are too apt to do, im∣proper
intimacies and connections; the worthy very ami∣able-hearted
William Browne, Esquire, Gentleman-com∣moner
of Magdalen Hall, now the very worthy rector of
Horton, near Windsor. That parish was once so happy as
to have the excellent Mr. Romaine for curate. This
amiable-hearted young gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Browne was one of several gentlemen who, although in distant parts of the kingdom, as if by consent, put themselves into brother's mourning for their beloved lamented friend.</NOTE>, hearing from his bed∣maker,
Mrs. Leycester, that Mr. Berkeley was coming to
Oxford, bid her take no thought about a lodging; for
that, in Mr. Berkeley's infirm state of health, it must be
more agreeable to him to be in his own old rooms, which
Mr. Browne had desired the Principal to let him ex∣change
for his, when Mr. Berkeley was obliged to quit
them; immediately took a lodging for himself, and directed
Mrs. Leycester and the worthy Mr. William Wells<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This young man was an orphan, and attended the hall with fruit, &amp;c. Mr. Berkeley's piercing eye soon descried that shirts would add to his comfort. He soon appeared in the hall thus equipped. One of the gentlemen of the hall said to him, <Q REND="inline">"Why Will! you have got a nice new shirt. But, Will, it is not complete; those who gave you the shirt should have treated you with ruffles to it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, replied Will; they had too much good sense to do that. It would ill become any one to wear <HI>ruffles</HI> on a shirt that was given to them in <HI>charity.</HI>"</Q> The wisdom of Will was, at least, as much ad∣mired as the wit of the gentleman. Some time after Mr. Berkeley's death, his Mother, on seeing this honest, worthy, young man, observed to him, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. William, you have lost a kind friend."</Q> He burst into tears, and could scarcely articulate, <Q REND="inline">"That I have, indeed, Madam. Can I do any thing to serve you?"</Q> The gratitude of the worthy Mrs. Leycester is great, for some essential services rendered her by Mr. Berkeley during his residence at the hall.</NOTE>,

an early <HI>protegé</HI> of Mr. Berkeley, to prepare the rooms
for his reception, and collected a number of Mr. Berkeley's
old friends, to spend the evening with him, and, of course,
their beloved and respected tutor, the Reverned Mr. Green,
the vice-principal, on account of whose great learning, and
strict attention to his pupils, Dr. Berkeley had recom∣mended
it to his son to enter at Magdalene Hall, rather
than at his own beloved Christ Church, or under his old
excellent friend, the angelic-hearted Bishop of Norwich,
under whose roof, and in whose chearful gay society and
that of his worthy Lady and beautiful daughters, Mr.
Berkeley passed many happy hours of his Oxford life; the
delightfully amiable Bishop always considering the Son of
his oldest friend as, to use the French term, <HI>enfant de fa∣mille.</HI>
That throughly angelic Prelate would frequently re∣late
little anecdotes of Mr. Berkeley's gay, lively wit, with
greater pleasure than a parent might venture to do, without
being suspected of too great partiality. The writer of this
Preface cannot dismiss this beloved, respected character
<PB N="cviii" REF="116"/>
of her incomparable old friend, without saying what the same
pen wrote, when the Church of England lost this bright
mild star, and the church of Scotland his counterpart: That
Bishop Horne, and the Reverend Dr. Gillespie, late Principal
of the Divinity College in the University of St. Andrew.

to shine in this dark world for more than threescore years
before they took their flight to join their kindred spirits;
and may the Writer of these pages, through Redeeming
Love, be admitted, in God's appointed time, to rejoin those
sweet spirits, whose society was so exhilarating here. Both
were remarkably cheerful agreeable companions; both had,
perhaps, attended to that line of Dr. Young,<Q>"'Tis impious in a good man to be sad;"</Q>
and to a still higher than Dr. Young, St. Paul, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Rejoice

as if, like Manasseh, they were dragging about fetters of

such ill-judging gloomy spirits:—<Q><PB N="cix" REF="117"/>
<L>"As if religion (the religion of the blessed Jesus) ever
was intended</L>

the gloom. <Q REND="inline">"ACQUAINT thyself with God,"</Q> says holy
Job, <Q REND="inline">"and be at peace."</Q> It is one thing to get a slight

so to do; and all are invited: <Q REND="inline">"Come unto <HI>me</HI> all ye that

<P>After passing a couple of days at Oxford, to rest, and
bid a <HI>last</HI> adieu to his friends in that beloved place, he pro∣ceeded,
by easy journeys, toward Cheltenham. He was met
on the road by his Father, Mother, and his Father's cou∣sin-german,
the generous, amiable, and compassionate Mrs.
D. Monck, too well known in the polite circles of
London and Bath, for her polite attentions, elegant hospi∣tality,
and unbounded generosity to her relations, her
friends, and the poor, to need an enumeration here. To
attempt to do justice to her exquisitely kind, amiable, un∣wearied
attentions to Mr. Berkeley during the last six
weeks of his life spent at Cheltenham, or his and his Pa∣rents
gratitude to that extraordinary Lady, is a task not to be
executed perhaps by <HI>any</HI> pen, much less by one so very
imbecile. Suffice it therefore to say, May God reward in
<PB N="cx" REF="118"/>
TIME and through ETERNITY; what Mr. Berkeley termed
Mrs. Monck's <Q REND="inline">"divine attentions"</Q> to him. Amen.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's strength daily decreasing, as it had done
for many months, he never walked out but twice at Chel∣tenham,
once to look at the beautiful church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With a handsome painting of <HI>that</HI> church the eyes of the Editor are daily delighted; for which she is indebted to the elegant pencil of her very highly accomplished, sensible, amiable, young friend, Miss Hamilton, one of the daughters of Lord Archibald Hamilton, who, although so very distant in point of years, honoured the Editor by seeking her acquaintance—an <HI>honour</HI> but very rarely <HI>granted</HI> by the Editor to <HI>young</HI> ladies of any rank. When young herself, she had only two young friends, Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> and Mrs. D. W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>; all her other intimate friends and correspondents were ten, some fifteen years older than herself.—<HI>Little,</HI> she <HI>used</HI> to think, was to be learned from girls of her own age <HI>forty</HI> years ago; much less, alas! now; unless it be, to go without cloathing in these hard times, and so save a little money. Mr. Monck Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"it was <HI>a mercy</HI> that God did not spare the life of his little sister; that, if he had, both his Mother and self should certainly have <HI>ended their days</HI> at <HI>Tyburn;</HI> for, had she as many lives as a cat is said to have, we should both have killed her <HI>nine</HI> times, if she had behaved as the generality of girls of fashion do now."</Q> He always named <HI>some</HI> as exceptions. He had not the honour, the pleasure, to be acquainted with Miss Hamiltons.</NOTE>, where he
felt his mortal remains would soon be deposited, in hope
of a joyful resurrection to immortal life, which he humbly
hoped through CHRIST JESUS HIS SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>Curiosity perhaps may have led many to run their eye,
for want of something else to do, over this short indigested
sketch of the short life of a young Man, of whom it cannot
<PB N="cxi" REF="119"/>
be said, there is nothing remarkable in it; for, were the
account of Mr. Berkeley's life methodically written by a
learned, accurate pen, perhaps few lives of double the
length of his could furnish more curious matter. The
number of astonishing hair-breadth escapes of life, in his very
early childhood, used to occasion his Mother to express her
fears, that he would resemble Pope Sixtus Quintus, or the
celebrated unfortunate Wortley Montague, Esquire; both
of whom, it is well known, were incessantly in perils, and
escaped most wonderfully. A very worthy woman, that
waited on Lady Mary Wortley Montague when he was born,
and many years afterwards, in her advanced age lived with
an intimate friend of Mrs. Berkeley's Mother, when Mrs.
Berkeley was a girl, and was by her frequently enter∣tained
with the wonderful exploits of <HI>Master</HI> Montague;
and those of <HI>Master</HI> Berkeley were in many instances so si∣milar
as to cause the supremest vigilance in Mrs. Berkeley.
Her younger son, although a wonderfully lively alert child,
never had any danger to encounter, never had any <HI>known</HI>
escape from danger, which occasioned Mr. Berkeley's fre∣quent
dangers and escapes to be the more noticed by the
whole family. The spirit of one <Q REND="inline">"<HI>returned early to God who

Had he lived until <HI>this time,</HI> he might have seen SOME who drop it before they lie stretched on their death bed. A mask is a very troublesome thing to fit on <HI>nicely</HI> in youth, when one may be allowed to attend a little to dress.

will be easily believed, that this anxiety did not <HI>decrease</HI> on
the letters she perpetually received from her excellent
friends, Lady Laurie and Mrs. Frinsham from Dover, of
the declining state of Mr. Berkeley's health; and, dreading
lest she might never have an opportunity of conversing with
him on earth, she repeatedly wrote to conjure them to
procure for Mr. Berkeley's perusal a small volume, that she
persuaded herself would pour balm into his humble contrite
spirit. These excellent Ladies, incessantly procuring com∣forts
for his agonized stomach, and well knowing how con∣stantly
and how frequently Mr. Berkeley redde and studied
<PB N="cxiv" REF="122"/>
the Book of Books, as good Bishop Ridley, at the stake,
termed the Book of God, omitted to comply with Mrs.
Berkeley's request; they <HI>then</HI> never having perused that
exquisite little volume, which Mr. Berkeley's Mother, on
finishing and closing it, almost involuntarily exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"My God, I desire to praise thy mercy, that thou hast
permitted me to live to read this incomparable little
book."</Q> It expounds some parts of Scripture differently
from what many modern Divines of the Church of England
understand them, although perfectly consonant to the Arti∣cles
of the Church of England, and written by one of her
brightest ornaments, who may be termed, as the evange∣lical
Bishop Hall used to style his seraphic friend, the Ho∣nourable
Robert Boyle, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a Lay Bishop.</HI>"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley,
knowing that her Son dreaded any thing that <HI>he</HI> conceived
might open a door to licentiousness, and she equally dread∣ing
any thing that might lead him to despair of God's mercy
through Christ to all true penitents, for some days forbore
to produce this invaluable little volume. One morning,
after breakfast, sitting in Mr. Berkeley's room, he said,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I wish you would be so good as to
read to me.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"What shall I read, my dear?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Something good.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Shall I read in the Bible?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cxv" REF="123"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; Morsey has just been reading that to me.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"What then, my dear, do you choose?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, pray read to me some of <HI>your own</HI>
books."</Q></P>
<P>By <HI>your own</HI> books, Mr. Berkeley meant either Romaine or
Hervey, &amp;c. Mrs. Berkeley then drew the little volume
out of her pocket, and began; she had not redde far, be∣fore
Mr. Berkeley put back his curtain, and said,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Pray, my dear Madam, whose book is that?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"It is mine, my dear.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes, I know that: <HI>you know</HI> what I
mean; who is the writer?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why do you ask, my dear? Do you like it?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, most exceedingly! Pray tell me <HI>who</HI> is
the author?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear, it is written by my excellent
old friend, Sir Richard Hill."</Q></P>
<P>He then exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! best of Mothers, do not
make an Antinomian of your <HI>poor</HI> Son; <HI>for, if you do, he
is lost for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"My dear child, Sir Richard Hill is no more
an Antinomian than <HI>your</HI> Mother; and <HI>you</HI> have long
<PB N="cxvi" REF="124"/>
known <HI>her</HI> horror of that dreadful doctrine of DEVILS. As
I have always told you, till a certain text can be expunged
from Scripture, no <HI>real</HI> Christian can become an Antino∣mian: 'Without HOLINESS no man shall see the Lord.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Pray proceed."</Q></P>
<P>On the Monday he requested Mrs. Berkeley to read out
of it again; and one day asking her to read to him, she re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear, I have just laid it out of my pocket,
on the table in my own room."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>But,</HI> best
of Mothers, you <HI>can</HI> have the goodness to go and fetch
it:"</Q> which request was of course instantly complied with.
He frequently exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"It is a wonderful book,
surely."</Q> The title—"The Deep Things of GOD, or Milk
and Strong Meat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Berkeley every day, immediately on quitting her Son's room, wrote under many of the numbers Mr. Berkeley's comments upon them. She has had that incomparable identical book most elegantly bound, gilt, &amp;c. and, poor as she is, would not take five hundred pounds for it. If it may be permitted us to compare small things with great, that excellent, kind, unwearied friend, one of the trustees to Mrs. Berkeley's marriage settlement, is now perpetually labour∣ing to assist his old friend in her worldly concerns, her multiplicity of <HI>ugly</HI> busi∣nesses, as he was to assist her angelic son with his spiritual aid.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>About ten days before his lamented death, his Mother,
sitting in her usual place, close to his pillow, he thus ad∣dressed
her: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I have a favour to beg of
you. Pray, promise me that you will grant it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My
dear child, you <HI>know,</HI> that if it is any thing in <HI>my</HI> power,
<PB N="cxvii" REF="125"/>
you may command it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"It is, that you will promise
me faithfully to send a copy of this book over to Ireland,
for it is a book of a <HI>very</HI> extraordinary nature <HI>indeed</HI>—the
most wonderfull book <HI>surely</HI> that ever was written by man,
uninspired; and God knows, they lamentably want it in
that poor country, as well as in this."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley en∣quired
to whom he wished her to send it. He mentioned
a particular old friend of his Father, for whom Mr. Berkeley
had a very great and unfeigned regard. Mrs. Berkeley pro∣mised
him, that, if it pleased God to spare her life, she cer∣tainly
would send it without fail.</P>
<P>The evening immediately preceding Mr. Berkeley's happy
departure, as Mrs. Berkeley was sitting by his bed side,
he fell into a sweet sleep. A servant came to announce
to her, that tea was made. She went silently out of the
room. In a few minutes he awoke, and enquired of his
servant, <Q REND="inline">"Where is my Mother?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Just gone down to
tea, Sir."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Go down, and give my duty to her, and
say, that when she has <HI>quite</HI> done drinking her tea, I beg
to speak with her."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley instantly obeyed the
summons; he kindly reproached her for having come so
quickly, saying, <Q REND="inline">"He feared she had not taken her tea
(which he knew was her favourite refreshment) in com∣fort."</Q>
On being assured that she had done, he began,
<Q REND="inline">"My dearest Mother, I beg that you will have the good∣ness
to promise me <HI>solemnly,</HI> that you will send that ex∣cellent
<PB N="cxviii" REF="126"/>
book over to Ireland."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My dear, I did promise
you, about a fortnight ago, that I would certainly send it
if I lived. Did I ever in my life, from your infancy,
break any promise, good or bad, that I made to you,
or to your dear brother?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No, never, I believe, in
your whole life."</Q> But I thought, perhaps, that you might
<Q REND="inline">"promise me, as a dy<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>"</Q> He was going to say, it
is supposed, <Q REND="inline">"as a dying man."</Q> He stopped short, think∣ing
it would too tenderly affect his almost broken-hearted
Mother, and proceeded to say, to pacify me, and make me
easy, again repeating, <Q REND="inline">"It is a most <HI>extraordinary</HI> WONDER∣FUL
book surely."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley might most <HI>happily</HI> term it such; for it was
that <HI>alone,</HI> by the mercy of God, that <HI>could,</HI> that <HI>did,</HI> ena∣ble
him to triumph over the KING of TERRORS.</P>
<P>Mrs. Frinsham used frequently, when visiting at Dr.
Berkeley's, to say to her sister, <Q REND="inline">"I am surprized your chil∣dren
are ever terrified: you promise them a whipping, or
a <HI>starving,</HI> (so she termed a dinner of potatoes and water;
for it injures children's stomachs to fast entirely, or go to
bed supperless;) in so very good humoured a voice, that
I wonder they ever believe you."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley used to
assure her, that there was no need of uttering the promise
in the tone of a fish-woman, as they <HI>well</HI> knew, whatever
the <HI>voice</HI> was, the <HI>threat</HI> would <HI>infallibly</HI> be executed.</P>
<P><PB N="cxix" REF="127"/>
A curious little anecdote of Mr. Berkeley's early entering
into characters occurred when he was just turned six years
old. One day Mrs. Frinsham and Dr. Berkeley, going
down the Southcote Walk, he gallopped by them, whip∣ping
his horse (a fine long stick), saying, <Q REND="inline">"Miss Frinsham,
I am to dine upon bread and water to-day."</Q> His two
relatives, both made up of tenderness, lamentably exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! I hope not: go, and beg pardon."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Oh! that
won't do."</Q> To which his Father replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my
dear, go, and try to coax your Mamma."</Q> With a look
of ineffable scorn, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Sir, <HI>you</HI> don't
know MY Mamma. When <HI>once</HI> she has said (imitating
the exact tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Always as slow as a sentence could be uttered, and with all the solemnity of an excellent judge on the bench.</NOTE> in which the threat was denounced)
<HI>Berkeley! you shall dine to day upon bread and water,</HI>
if the KING was to come, and go down upon <HI>both</HI> his
knees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Doctor and Mrs. Berkeley being very old-fashioned persons in some things; their children constantly asking their parents blessing every morning and night, were never suffered to kneel on both knees, Mrs. Berkeley's father never suffering her to do it, always saying, <Q REND="inline">"Never fall on both your knees, but to your Father in Heaven. He is King of kings,—Lord of lords. You cannot humble yourselves enough to him."</Q> Asking a parent's blessing is now quite obsolete. The Editor has very frequently seen her old hereditary friend, the agreeable learned Author of "CHRISTIANITY NOT FOUNDED ON ARGUMENT," (alas! for him, poor man!) on his arrival from his own seat in Surrey, at his pious mother's house in Berks, constantly drop on his knee, previously to his taking notice of any one, before his mother's chair, (she was lame,) saying, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I beg your blessing."</Q>—This, it must be known, was out of respect to her,—Mr. Berkeley that he might obtain a Parent's intercession with GOD.</NOTE> to her, she would not pardon me. My Mamma is
<PB N="cxx" REF="128"/>
not like you—when I am naughty, take and give me a
good hearty shake or two, and scold me for a minute or
two, and then forget it directly."</Q> The idea of his Ma∣jesty's
intercession being vain, was a lucky one; or per∣haps
as his Majesty, in hunting, frequently passed through
Dr. Berkeley's grounds, this extraordinary little genius
might have thrown himself in his way. He had been told
that nobody must ever turn their backs on the King. When
about five years old, walking one evening with his Mother
and Miss Leigh, a relation of hers, in Kensington gardens,
he on a sudden began walking backwards, presently saying,
<Q REND="inline">"Dear ladies, why do you not walk backwards?"</Q> Some
gentleman passed, whom <HI>he</HI> supposed to be his Majesty,
whom he had then never seen. But to return.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt that he had broken God's Law, had fallen
into temptation, and considering that he had received a tho∣roughly
pious education, as he used to tell his consoling Mo∣ther,
when she repeatedly applied to his broken contrite spirit,
that glorious promise, <Q REND="inline">"Though your <HI>sins</HI> be as <HI>scarlet,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c.
and that infinitely gracious one of our eternal co-equal Sa∣viour
God, <Q REND="inline">"Him that cometh unto me I will in <HI>no wise</HI> cast
out.—Come unto me, ALL ye that are weary and heavy
<PB N="cxxi" REF="129"/>
laden, and I will refresh you."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my dear Mo∣ther,
I have been a more grievous sinner than others,
because I have had a more pious education than most
persons."</Q> But, blessed, for ever blessed, be the astonish∣ing
Love of God the COMFORTER, this blessed little book
poured the balm of perfect peace, of joy, into his lovely
wounded spirit; and he wished others to be consoled by it.</P>
<P>One morning, after all fear of vengeance on account of
the broken Law of God was quite done away, by HIS
mercy, <Q REND="inline">"who is MIGHTY to save,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"who trod the
wine-press ALONE,"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, going into the room,
as was her custom, enquired if he had passed a tolerable
night. His reply was, <Q REND="inline">"I have had great pain, and have
not closed my eyes one minute since I saw you; but I
have been in heaven, blessed be the MERCY of GOD."</Q>
A few mornings afterwards the same anxious enquiry was
answered in the very same words, with this addition,
<Q REND="inline">"Surely, my dearest Mother, it is not an illusion of my
GRAND ENEMY, to lull me into security."</Q> So watchful
was he against deceiving himself, especially in the concerns
of his soul; to which his Mother earnestly replied, <Q REND="inline">"No,
my dear child, NO. That God whom you have laboured
so zealously, so faithfully, to serve, although he has per∣mitted
you to <HI>fall,</HI> to shew you your own frailty, yet he will
never suffer the Enemy of Souls to delude you. Besides,
my dearest creature what <HI>can</HI> the Devil hope to gain by you,
<PB N="cxxii" REF="130"/>
in your present helpless, languishing state, unless he could
tempt you to blaspheme, or despair, as you lie stretched
on a bed of languishing? And, blessed be the free grace
of God, he has never yet been able to do either the one
or the other. No, my dear Son, God has vouchsafed,
in infinite mercy, to lift up the light of his reconciled
countenance upon you, to answer the constant fervent
prayers of your poor unworthy Mother, and your own,
on <HI>this</HI> side the grave."</Q> At two, three, or four nights
distance, Mr. Berkeley had two or three more such blessed
nights; for which wonderfully gracious vouchsafement all
glory be to FREE SOVEREIGN GRACE and REDEEMING
LOVE.</P>
<P>The day before Mr. Berkeley's death, he discovered, by
what Dr. Berkeley happened to drop, that Mrs. Berkeley had
sat up the whole of the preceding night in the next room.
His eyes flashed with indignation, and he instantly spoke to
her concerning it. As Mrs. Berkeley never, in the polite in∣tercourse
of life, suffers herself to falsify<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A lady one day requested Mrs. Berkeley to make a very fine <HI>made-up</HI> speech of excuse for her to some other lady; to which Mrs. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Would it not, Madam, be better to tell the truth, and say, that really a multiplicity of engagements have rendered it inconvenient for you to go so far?"</Q> Mr. Monck Berkeley, happening to be present, remarked, <Q REND="inline">"How little that good lady knows MY Mother! why She will not tell a <HI>civil</HI> lye for my Father, or myself. Her idea is, that many <HI>obliging, polite, kind, friendly</HI> things may be said, without sacrificing TRUTH."</Q> The worthy amiable Mrs. Waller, sister of the Archdeacon of Essex, the friend of Mrs. Berkeley from eight years old, always says, <Q REND="inline">"There is a real pleasure in hearing a polite thing from Mrs Berkeley, "for you may <HI>swear</HI> it comes from her heart."</Q></NOTE>, she was obliged at
<PB N="cxxiii" REF="131"/>
last to confess, that she had reposed on the sopha in the
drawing-room. He earnestly exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God! <HI>so
my dear Mother is to kill herself for me:</HI> that is at last
to be the end of <HI>her.</HI>"</Q> And, turning to his Father, he
said, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, <HI>why</HI> would you <HI>suffer</HI> it?"</Q> Dr.
Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child, your Mother would have
been wretched if I had interposed."</Q> He then extorted a
solemn promise from his Mother, that she would go to rest
that night, amiably adding, <Q REND="inline">"and promise that you will un∣dress,
and go into bed, or I will not attempt to close my
eyes all night."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley retired, with a strict in∣junction
to Dr. Berkeley's and Mr. Berkeley's own servant,
both of whom attended him with wonderful assiduity, al∣ternately
lying in a tent-bed in Mr. Berkeley's room, and
sitting up with him, that she would never forgive them, if
they perceived the least change in Mr. Berkeley, and did
not instantly call her up.</P>
<P>On the morning of January 26, Mr. Berkeley's servant
knocked at the chamber-door, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that he came with
his Master's duty, and desired Dr. Berkeley would go
down, and pray with him."</Q> Dr. Berkeley instantly arose,
and went down. Just as Mrs. Berkeley had put on some
<PB N="cxxiv" REF="132"/>
of her cloaths, Dr. Berkeley, returned, announcing <Q REND="inline">"the
heavy tidings,"</Q> that they had lost their <HI>earthly</HI> treasure.
Mrs. Berkeley, although having ever earnestly wished and
prayed to witness the last moments of all those beloved re∣lations
she is doomed to survive, submitted, in she humbly
trusts, profound silence to the will of the ALL-WISE Dis∣poser
of ALL events; acting, as well as daily praying, <Q REND="inline">"Thy
will be done <HI>in</HI> me, <HI>on</HI> me, and <HI>by</HI> me."</Q> Mr. Berkeley,
in a letter to his Mother, during his illness, says, <Q REND="inline">"I trust
I have learned my dearest Mother's prayer, 'Thy will,'
&amp;c.</Q> Mrs. Berkeley sunk again into her bed. Just as the
clock struck nine, she exclaimed to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"If ever
I heard Berkeley cough in my life, he has coughed this
minute."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my dear, no: you will never hear
him any more on earth."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's maid entered
at that instant, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was come to
life again, and wished to see Mrs. Berkeley."</Q> It may be
easily supposed that she was not long in getting down stairs,
where she saw her dear Son looking like an angel, his fine
eyes as lively as when in perfect health; and for about a
fortnight before his death, his nose became so exactly like
the beautiful one of his two grandfathers, Bishop Berkeley
and Mr. Frinsham, both having the same fine-shaped nose,
that he looked remarkably beautiful. The same change
after death took place, in the same feature of Dr. Berkeley's
wonderfully beautiful face. Such changes are said, by
the learned men of the faculty, often to happen a few
<PB N="cxxv" REF="133"/>
hours before the separation of the spirit from the earthly
mould.</P>
<P>Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley both wanted what Mrs.
Berkeley always termed the genuine Berkeley nose, and
which her own father, without being a Berkeley, had. The
present Countess Dowager of Granard has it. When the
beautiful lady Georgiana Berkeley, she was a fac simile of a
wonderfully fine ivory medallion taken of Bishop Berkeley,
at Rome, when a young man. Dr. Berkeley used to say,
to Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, your nose is a <HI>judgement</HI> upon your
Mother, for despising mine, because it is not like my fa∣ther's."</Q>
Mr. Monck Berkeley had, from pictures in Berke∣ley
Castle, and from monuments, drawings of all his noble
ancestors, and used to show his Mother some few with a
short nose; to which she used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, some ugly
mother has introduced it."</Q> When Doctor Berkeley, in
the case of the late brave Admiral B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, as plain as he
was valiant, his lady one of the most beautiful women in
Europe,—the sons all resembling the mother, the very clever
worthy daughters the good Admiral:—observed, <Q REND="inline">"What a
pity it is that those poor girls have all got such an horrid
<HI>dash</HI> of their father in their faces!"</Q> The young ladies are
all well married, and make as excellent wives as their beau∣tiful
mother. The worthy veteran used to say, <Q REND="inline">"I never
thought my wife handsome, until Dr. Berkeley talked so
much of her beauty. <HI>I</HI> know she was a <HI>very</HI> good wife."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cxxvi" REF="134"/>
Mr. Berkeley, who always greatly delighted in the Psalms,
desired those of the day, both morning and evening, might
be redde to him; in which he joined. The evening Psalms
of the 26th day of the month conclude the exixth Psalm.
Mr. Berkeley felt the whole well suited to his state, parti∣cularly
the <HI>last</HI> verse. His Father prayed with him, the
family attending, and pronounced, at the request of his
Mother, that delightful absolution of the excellent Church
of England, in her office for the Visitation of the Sick. He
appeared so much revived, that his friends all quitted the
room a little before noon, except his Mother, the medical
gentlemen who attended having given it as their opinion
that he would remain until about ten at night. In about
half an hour, his Mother, perceiving that speaking seemed
rather painful to him, and that he breathed rather quicker,
said, <Q REND="inline">"We will pray:"</Q> and, taking out of her pocket
Bishop Hall's excellent little book of Devotions for <HI>all</HI> oc∣casions,
and <HI>all</HI> relations in life, from which she petitioned
at the Throne of Grace for her Son, as soon as his soul,
the breath of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, entered his body; she now, when she
conceived it was returning to God, prostrated herself by the
bed-side, and his servant at the foot of the bed, when (oh!
the wonderful goodness of Christ,) she was enabled to offer
that fine prayer for one just departing out of this world,
with a distinct voice, and without one falling tear, which
she well knew would have thrown her Son into extreme
<PB N="cxxvii" REF="135"/>
agony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley, from a child of three years old, could never support the sight of his Mother in tears. Had she chosen to condescend to practise art, and have wept, she might have managed her Son as she pleased, from three to al∣most thirty years old. After his arrival at Cheltenham, observing the tears standing in her eyes, he exclaimed to his Father, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Sir, this is too much for me to support. I have all my life, since I knew how to pray, besought God to inflict any suffering upon me, but that of seeing my dear Mother in tears."</Q> Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear, can you suppose that your Mother, much command as she has over herself, must not sometimes be overcome?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley wiped her eyes, and chearfully said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear, shall I get a mask?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Any thing, best</HI> of Mothers, to prevent <HI>my</HI> seeing your tears. I never could bear it in my health and strength."</Q> Mr. Berkeley, when a youth, once said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My</HI> Mother never laughs."</Q>—To which his Father replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well if your Mother never laughs herself, she makes us laugh very often, and that is more to our purpose than if she did. We have this com∣fort, that she never weeps without REAL cause."</Q></NOTE>. Mr. Berkeley joined in that fine prayer, the
Lord's Prayer, and <Q REND="inline">"The Lord lift up the light of his re∣conciled
countenance,"</Q> &amp;c. Mrs. Berkeley then seated her∣self
by her Son's pillow; he fixed his still fine eyes most
tenderly upon her for about two minutes, then closed them,
she conceiving that he was resolved his poor unworthy
Mother should be the last earthly object they should be∣hold.
He then, without calling for the assistance of his
servant, turned himself quite round to the other side of
his bed, laid his arms down by his side, and made himself
quite ready for his coffin; then uttered three distinct as∣pirations,
as was conceived, to that co-equal Triune God,
in whom he had ever so firmly believed from the age of
fifteen. After a little time, one single deep breath to <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
as was supposed, his lovely spirit winged its happy flight to
the realms of bliss. There may all who loved him, in
God's appointed time, join him in casting their crowns be∣fore
<PB N="cxxviii" REF="136"/>
the Throne, and singing, "Worthy is the Lamb," &amp;c.
Thus ended the short—long—life of George Monck Berke∣ley,
Esquire; leaving his parents to—what shall I say?—deplore
their irreparable loss. They could hardly be so
selfish; and as Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, a near relation of his Father,
and Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, an old intimate friend, both with
one consent, although in very distant parts, said, in their
letters to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"It is hardly possible to condole:
one must rather exult with you on so happy, so delight∣ful
an exit."</Q> And his Mother has often asserted, that if a
wish would restore to her the <HI>sweet</HI> society of her beloved
Son and Husband, she would not be selfish enough—wicked
enough—to form that wish.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley prayed fervently to God for three things;
and He that heareth the prayers of the contrite, heard and
answered him:</P>
<P>First, That the agonies of his stomach might cease one
week before he quitted this mortal life. <Q REND="inline">"Oh! spare me
a little, that I may recover my strength before I go hence,
and be no more seen."</Q>—The mercy of God graciously
ordered, that they ceased just ten days before his death;
<PB N="cxxix" REF="137"/>
and, instead of that craving for fruits and acids, he rather
wished to avoid taking any thing, not even orange and le∣mon
jelly; so as to occasion his Mother's one day saying,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Man, if you do not take a little nourishment,
you will be a suicide;"</Q> to which he hastily replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!
God, for Jesus' sake, avert."</Q> He then took the glass of
jelly from her hand, and said, <Q REND="inline">"I will take any thing you
wish."</Q></P>
<P>Going into his room one morning, he, as usual, en∣quired
kindly of Mrs. Berkeley concerning her health, to
which she replied, <Q REND="inline">"As well, my dear, as I can expect to
be, with this horrid weather."</Q> Frost has ever been ex∣ceedingly
inimical to Mrs. Berkeley's health. He, with
the mildest, sweetest voice, said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, is it
<HI>quite</HI> right in us to find fault with any weather, or any
thing that God pleases to send us?"</Q> A few years ago,
an Irish gentleman of fortune, of Cork, published a long
letter in the St. James's Chronicle, on the same idea. It
may, perhaps, be wrong; but one has, from childhood,
been accustomed to say, unreproved, <Q REND="inline">"What horrid, or
what vile weather this is!"</Q></P>
<P>Secondly, That he might not die in the night, or in his
sleep.—He expired exactly at noon, the sun shining more
remarkably bright and clear than is at all usual at that sea∣son
of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="cxxx" REF="138"/>
Thirdly, That he might retain his senses perfectly to the
very last breath he drew. How graciously that petition
was answered has been above related.</P>
<P>Monsieur Le Moyne, in a beautiful little work, which, I
believe, is not translated into English, says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>La mer nous
représent la bonté du bon Dieu au pénitents.—La mer tou∣jours
sort pour rencontre les rivieres,</HI>"</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was too well known in the metropolises of
these three kingdoms to make a particular description of
his person necessary. Suffice it therefore to say, that the
beauty of his face by no means equalled that of his exqui∣sitely
beautiful Father, and his still handsomer Grandfather,
Bishop Berkeley. He more resembled, in face and stature,
his Mother's Father, the thoroughly excellent Reverend
Henry Frinsham, A.M. esteemed when at Oxford, and
till debilitated by illness, the strongest, <Q REND="inline">"best-built"</Q> man in
England. Mr. Frinsham and his grandson were both six
feet high without their shoes: each took care not be in∣debted
to them for additional height; both their strength
was muscular, both having remarkably small bones. Mr.
Berkeley was much handsomer than Mr. Frinsham, except∣ing
his nose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Frinsham going once to dine with a friend at a gentleman's house, one servant was observed not to move when any thing was called for. On being asked sharply, <Q REND="inline">"why he did not exchange plates,"</Q> &amp;c. he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"I can∣not do any thing for looking at that gentleman's (Mr. Frinsham's) beautiful nose."</Q> Mr. Berkeley strongly resembled both his grandfathers, and bore none, or very slight, resemblance to either of his parents. Mr. Berkeley could not look into a glass without perceiving that he did not resemble his Father. His agreeable wit used to divert his friends, by saying, <Q REND="inline">"Some poor simple person, now and then, meaning to flatter <HI>my</HI> Mother, says, 'Dear Ma∣dam, how much Mr. Berkeley resembles the Doctor;' I, who know <HI>le desous des cartes,</HI> see my Mother redden, and answer, 'Oh! dear Sir, or Madam, <HI>not</HI> the <HI>least in the world</HI>'—Sometimes a simpler soul says, Madam, I think Mr. Berkeley is very like you.—The first was bad enough, but now I can fancy I see my Mother getting her knuckles ready to knock them down."</Q>—Mrs. Berkeley used often to laugh, and say, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, how is it that, with very fine eyes, &amp;c. an exquisitely fine complexion, the finest teeth ever set in a head, and very fine hair, and a well-shaped face, <HI>you are not</HI> handsome."</Q> A most highly accomplished, sensible, intimate friend of Mr. Berkeley's Mother, the lady of D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, used often to say to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"If you tell him before me that he is not handsome, <HI>I will knock you down.</HI>—All the ladies and men say he is handsome.—Don't mind, Berkeley, what your Mother says, because you don't happen to be just like your Father."</Q></NOTE>, the great beauty of his face; his eyes much
<PB N="cxxxi" REF="139"/>
larger, which were decorated with his Father's beautiful
dark eye-brows and eye-lashes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Monck Berkeley's eyelashes were so remarkably long, as often, when he was a lad, to entangle and distress him when reading; a decoration of face to which he was indebted, as well as his Brother, to their Mother, who constantly cut them with a fine pair of scissors twice every moon: It is an infallible method of rendering them long and thick. With Mr. Berkeley it was attended with some little difficulty, from the extreme volatility of his motions. Dr. Berkeley and all her intimate friends thought her the most daring of spirits to venture to do it before Mr. Berkeley could listen to reason. It was then done when he was in a sound sleep. Afterwards with the following exhortation:—<Q REND="inline">"Now, child, stand as still as a statue; for, if you move your finger, or your eye, the least in the world, in go the scissors, and out goes your eye."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well; but then I shall have <HI>one</HI> left."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, you will not; for, when one is gone, the other generally goes soon after it; and you will never get eyes again until your body rises out of the grave at the day of judgement, and you will be always, all your life, in the dark."</Q>—Much as Mr. Berkeley loved in childhood to be in motion, this <HI>eloquent</HI> oration had as much weight as if it had been uttered by a Burke.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="cxxxii" REF="140"/>
Dr. Berkeley's family once attending some friends of
theirs of too high rank to be left entirely to the verger of
the week to view the curiosities of the magnificent cathe∣dral
of Canterbury; on reaching the tomb of the Black
Prince, the sword was taken out as usual, and delivered to
the company to admire. When going to be again deposited
within the iron railing, Mr. Berkeley took it into his hands,
and drew it with as much ease as he would have drawn his
own sword. Mrs. Preston, the verger's wife, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Good Lord! Sir, what have you done?"</Q> Mr. Berkeley's
Mother instantly said, <Q REND="inline">"I hope no harm. My dear Berke∣ley,
why would you draw it without asking if it was per∣mitted
to be drawn?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Harm, Madam,"</Q> replied the
worthy woman; <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley has done no harm, if he
has not hurt himself;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir; I suppose I
have seen more than an hundred gentlemen attempt to
draw that sword, but no one ever accomplished it with
one hand but yourself."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's alarm then sub∣sided,
and she replied, <Q REND="inline">"He has his Mother's and Grand-father's
wonderful strength of wrist."</Q> So entirely muscular
was his strength, that, a short time before his death, that
wrist that could lift a man nearly as tall as himself by the
<PB N="cxxxiii" REF="141"/>
collar of the coat, did not measure half an inch more than
his Mother's, who is a very little woman.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley's person altogether made what per∣sons
usually term a very fine looking young man. He was
so exactly proportioned, that he never appeared a tall man,
except when standing in a groupe. He had a most graceful
figure, and was esteemed the finest dancer of his stature
in England. At the famous masquerade given by the late
Lord Barrymore at Wargrove, where Mr. Berkeley ap∣peared
as an Highland Chief, most completely elegantly
equipped; purse, claymore, dirk, &amp;c. every thing but the
kelt, insted of which he wore the trowse; two masks ac∣costed
him with, <Q REND="inline">"Laird, are you for a Highland reel?"</Q>
Mr. Berkeley instantly gave his claymore to a gentleman to
hold, stepped forward, and they began a <HI>threesome reel,</HI> in
which the superiority of Mr. Berkeley's dancing was so
marked, as to cause a very great personage, who honoured
that most elegant masquerade with his presence, to stand the
whole time, and to say, at the expiration of that beautiful
dance, when well danced by <HI>Scots,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley was
the finest figure, and the finest dancer he had ever seen;"</Q>
and praise from those who excel in any art, is <HI>praise.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, although not regularly handsome, had
perhaps one of the most pleasing countenances any where
to be seen—a look of the deepest thought, enlightened by
<PB N="cxxxiv" REF="142"/>
the sweetest, mildest benevolence, and, when called forth,
brightened by the liveliest chastized gaiety; which has
caused some of the first characters for learning and sense
to assert, that Mr. Monck Berkeley was the most agreeable
companion they had ever known. That look of deep
thought, and exquisite benevolence, seldom united in the
same soul, seldomer blended in the same countenance, are
so astonishingly preserved in the beautiful portrait painted
by his beloved friend, Mr. Peters, and by that throughly
amiable gentleman presented to Mrs. Berkeley after her
Son's death, as to delight all who have a soul capable of en∣joying
the beauties of an exquisite painting. The print
prefixed to the Poems is taken from that exquisite painting;
but Engraving cannot give the soul like Painting. Mrs.
Berkeley esteems herself rich in a most beautiful miniature
of her unspeakably dear Son, so small as constantly to be
carried in the pocket, taken from Mr. Peters's portrait, by
the wonderful, the magic pencil of her excellent accom∣plished
friend, Miss Johnson, of the Paddock-House near
Canterbury. Whoever has an eye for fine painting, and
has been treated with a fight of that Lady's performances,
must be sensible of the happiness of possessing one of a dear
departed friend. It can hardly be said departed. He is
present, and does every thing but articulate. Such obli∣gations
are not to be repaid. The mines of Brazil, if pos∣sessed,
are not adequate. Mrs. Berkeley was some years
ago indebted to the same exquisite pencil for a bracelet
<PB N="cxxxv" REF="143"/>
of her youngest Son, done entirely from memory; for two
indifferent pictures of that beautiful child rather confused
than assisted.</P>
<P>At the King's School at Canterbury a common amuse∣ment
of the lower school was playing at <HI>judge and jury.</HI>
Counsel were regularly retained to plead on each side. By
accident Dr. Berkeley discovered the value that was set on
his Son's oratorical powers in that mimic court, on first hear∣ing
of it from the amiable beloved friend of his Son, the
late Mr. Thurlow, son of Lord Thurlow, whose play hours
were constantly spent under the hospitable roof of Dr.
Berkeley, who enquiring how the counsel were feed, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! we have all the same fee, a halfpenny apiece,
excepting Berkeley, and he has always a penny."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"A
penny! (replied Dr. Berkeley,) why should he have a
penny? I am sure, he is not covetous."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, no; but
they <HI>will</HI> give it him, because <HI>they</HI> are sure to <HI>win</HI> their
cause who have Berkeley on their side."</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps it may gratify some young gentlemen, his school∣felows,
in distant parts of the world, and bring the happy
innocent days of very early youth to their remembrance, if
they should glance their eye over this, to see their names.
At the head of this list stands dear angelic-hearted Mr.

Canterbury, for until lately that very respectable antient

some fortune from his mother;—the vast family

reigns of the Stuarts. Sir Henry Heyman may read em∣phatically,
<Q REND="inline">"put not your trust in princes."</Q> The great∣grandfather
of his friend, Mr. Monck Berkeley, is said to
have left his curse on his latest descendant who should ever
expend a shilling in the service of any King. Mr. Berke∣ley's
father hazarded it. It is almost incredible what it cost
him to advertize his famous sermon, preached on the 31st
of January, to endeavour to prevent a reform in parliament,—twenty guineas for advertizing it in one particular News∣paper,
besides frequently in some others, and in all country
papers!—presenting a copy to every member of both
Houses, whom, to use his own expression, <Q REND="inline">"he thought
had <HI>sense</HI> enough to understand it."</Q> It went through five
editions within four weeks, as the Doctor mentioned to a

friend a little time before his lamented death. A sixth
edition was very lately printed, consisting of one thousand
copies, which were all dispersed <HI>gratis</HI> amongst traders, &amp;c.

<P>It had been always said that Dr. Berkeley's grandfather<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Right Honourable John Forster, of Forrest near Dublin. During the reign of Queen Anne, his exertions for the House of Hanover were so well known, that the Speaker of the <HI>Irish</HI> House of Commons was every day, for some years, the first toast at the palace of Herenhausen; and so grateful was King George the First, for his essential services, that, on arriving in London, he said, <Q REND="inline">"The first man I will prefer is the Speaker of the Irish House of Com∣mons."</Q> This grateful Prince offered any, and every thing, together with a Peerage. Little was accepted, as his fortune was very large, and the Peerage gratefully declined. His Majesty said, <Q REND="inline">"I will promote all your brothers, Sir."</Q> The Speaker had an only brother, younger than himself, a senior Fellow of Dublin College, with a <HI>maternal</HI> estate of fifteen hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> who begged to decline the burden of a bishopric, being a very sickly man; but his Majesty insisted on <HI>inflicting</HI> it on him; for which the poor of Raphoe ought to bless his memory; for they, even to this day, eat bread, meat, and potatoes, at a very reduced price; Bishop Forster, at his death, bequeathing a very large sum annually out of his estates for ever. His conduct through life, and at death, was such as to make his witty successor, the only wit of his family for generations, say, <Q REND="inline">"It is not polite to name my predecessor in <HI>my</HI> presence, we are <HI>such</HI> a contrast."</Q></NOTE>

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the rebellion in 1745, Bishop Berkeley's letter to the Roman Catholics of the Diocese of Cloyne, for which he received the thanks of all the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland in the public papers, was at that time universally sup∣posed to have prevented the people of that persuasion from rising and joining the Chevalier de St. George, and, by their vast superiority in point of numbers, placing him on the throne of Ireland; and the Stuart family had then a great many concealed friends in England, who lay perdue till they saw which side was likely to prove victorious. A very worthy gentleman, one of the younger brothers of Bishop Berkeley, a most excellent officer, used often to say, <Q REND="inline">"I will never incur my grandfather's curse. My brother may do what he pleases."</Q> This gentleman, father to four very worthy ladies, all still living, was commander in chief in the year 1745 in the County Kingdom (as it is often called) of Fife. It will easily be supposed that it afforded no small pleasure to Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley, to have it frequently asked if they were at all related to that delightfully humane kind officer, who commanded in Fife in the rebellion. Numerous instances of his humanity were related to them. Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"he had often heard that brave veteran relate, with tears in his eyes, one adventure."</Q> Going to the castle of the father of the present worthy Earl of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, no men appeared; but the Countess came out with an infant at her breast, fell down on her knees at his feet, and conjured him for Christ's sake not to deprive her of two small cows, all that was left to keep her seven children and three female servants from perishing by famine.

noble-minded man used to say, <Q REND="inline">"By the blessing of God,
I will try to keep them there."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, as well
as his father and grandfather, was a very great politician.
The sermon was preached in Canterbury Cathedral, on
<HI>Monday,</HI> January 31, and by the orders and contrivance of
the preacher, and active acuteness of the well-known Al∣derman
Simmons of Canterbury, sold in Todd's shop at
York, on the next Thursday, in order to defeat Wyville's
meeting at that place, which, to the great delight of Dr.
Berkeley, it accomplished.</P>
<P><PB N="cxxxix" REF="147"/>
Dr. Berkeley never asked, during his life, but two fa∣vours
of ministry—equal to the exchanging two half-crowns
for five shillings, or two six-pences for a shilling: both,
however, were <HI>too great</HI> to be granted to the grandson of
the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons—to the son of
Bishop Berkeley. When his son left Canterbury School,
he wished to exchange his stall at Canterbury for either
Windsor or Westminster, to superintend the education of
his Son at one of those schools. He preferred Windsor.
Some years after, on his Son's leaving Eton, he again re∣quested
an exchange for a stall at Christ Church, but met
with similar success.</P>
<P>The exquisite amiability of Mr. Berkeley's <HI>nature, not his
temper,</HI> that being naturally wilful, in some sort rugged,
was <HI>re-formed</HI> by EDUCATION, <HI>re-generated</HI> by GRACE.
His nature, as has been shewn, was throughly NOBLE, un∣commonly
generous. He had by both his Parents, from
infancy, been bred up, with an horror of being what is
called a TUFT HUNTER at Oxford, or a sneaking LORD
COURTER at Eton. His <HI>real</HI> nobility of blood little needed
such cautions.</P>
<P>Soon after his going to the King's School at Canterbury,
there came to board, at Dr. Beauvoir's, Mr. Thurlow, only
son of the late Lord Chancellor Thurlow, by Miss Lynch,
<PB N="cxl" REF="148"/>
daughter of the charitable, hospitable Dean Lynch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dean Lynch preserved the poor of Canterbury from starving, as they have since done, by ordering five hundred pounds worth of silk damask to be wove, and entirely new furnished the Deanery. It raised that excellent trade, which the muslin Misses have since totally annihilated.

sister to the late accomplished Sir William, and to the hap∣piness
of the poor and distressed, or <HI>oppressed,</HI> the <HI>present</HI>
Reverend Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury. Each of
these gentlemen inherited a very large share of both their
parents' extraordinarily charitable disposition, as did the
late lovely Mrs. Hey and Mrs. Tatton, their sisters. Mr.
Thurlow then about eight years old, just half a year younger
than Mr. Berkeley, was sent from under the protection of
his sensible, wonderfully kind <HI>adopting</HI> father, the Reverend
Mr. Hey of Wickham, whose lady, above-named, was his
Mother's eldest sister. The Writer cannot proceed without
heaving a sigh, and dropping a tear of friendship over the
urn of that most sensible, interesting of youths, the only son
of dear Thurlow's <HI>earthly guardian angel,</HI> Mr. Hey. She
still feels pleasure in recollecting how often he used to say,
<Q REND="inline">"Is it not very odd, that, although I have uncles, aunts,
and many kind relations, who are very good to me; yet
I always feel myself more at home at Dr. Berkeley's?"</Q>
He was about fifteen; a youth of a very singular turn of
mind, endowed with all his father's great understanding,
<PB N="cxli" REF="149"/>
and all the real, mild, not affected, gentleness of his lovely
mother. A strong tincture of melancholy was visible to
even a common observer. As a child at home, it was said
he never loved to play; at school he never played at cric∣ket,
&amp;c. longer than ten minutes, then retired to read.
Mrs. Berkeley's wish to delight the mother of an only child
occasioned her telling her servants, <Q REND="inline">"that whenever Mrs.
Hey's carriage came to Dr. Berkeley's, some servant man,
or woman, must go immediately to Dr. Beauvoir's, where
he boarded, to fetch Master Hey."</Q> Both mother and
son felt more than this little <HI>motherly</HI> attention merited.
Mrs. Berkeley told Master Hey, when he felt himself low∣spirited,
and had no more agreeable place to take his tea,
he would find it in her dressing-room at six, where he
would, sometimes, enjoy the very improving conversation
of that accomplished, that wise director of young men, Dr.
Berkeley; if not, he might dissipate his gloom a little, by
hearing her <HI>raileries</HI> on his gravity, &amp;c. at fifteen, Mrs.
Berkeley, having been in the same predicament herself, at
twelve, with a youth of thirteen. Dear Johnny, as he was
always called by Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley, had contrived very
early in life, before he was thirteen, to form an attach∣ment,
that did not contribute to dissipate the natural gloom
of his mind, although it often exhilarated him.</P>
<P>The youngest daughter of the celebrated Mr. Airson,
although very far from handsome, was blessed with so very
<PB N="cxlii" REF="150"/>
fine an understanding, that all the uncommonly sensible
youths, and even lads, were her devoted admirers, as others
were of the great beauty of Dr. Beauvoir's eldest daughter,
now married to William Hammond, Esquire, of the Friers,
Canterbury. Miss Airson died at the age of nineteen.
Mrs. Berkeley used to say of her, <Q REND="inline">"that she had under∣standing
enough to set up a large country town."</Q> Her
gratitude was great indeed, (that VERY scarce virtue, grow∣ing
only in an <HI>humble</HI> heart, and cherished by a strong
head;) for what <HI>she</HI> deemed the condescending attentions
of Mrs. Berkeley to her, her father being a <HI>Minor</HI> where
Mrs. Berkeley's husband was a <HI>Major.</HI> Although very
kindly treated at Canterbury to what they are in most other
Cathedrals and Choirs, Norwich excepted; the Minor∣canons
and Schoolmasters, their wives and daughters, are
in a very different line of company. In general, their ori∣ginal
fortunes, and always their church incomes, are
undoubtedly so much inferior, as not to make them <HI>wish</HI> to
mix. Mrs. Berkeley, on being once reproached by a Pre∣bendary's
lady, for introducing Miss Airsons at her routs,
and being intimate with their elegant, sweet mother,
made this laconic reply: <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Madam, Mrs.
Airson's father had almost as many thousands a year as
<HI>my</HI> father had hundreds; and if Mrs. Airson chose to
marry the first singer in the world, a clergyman and a
<HI>gentleman,</HI> rather than a foolish ignoramus in a red coat,
does that make her conversation the less pleasing to me?
<PB N="cxliii" REF="151"/>
Should Mrs. Airson's elegant accomplished <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Burton, Esquire, of Shropshire.</NOTE> nephew, with
his noble estate, offer to ANY Prebendary's daughter, I
dare say, she would not refuse him. <HI>I</HI> have <HI>no</HI> daughter,
thank God, so am not courting Mrs. Airson for her ne∣phew."</Q>
Mr. Airson and his family were so highly, so
universally respected, that their small house was the resort
of all persons of fashion and good sense. The late amiable
Bishop of Norwich, when Dean of Canterbury, would
often, when walking out, say, <Q REND="inline">"Come, my dear Madam,
suppose we go to Johnny's coffee-house."</Q> Mr. Airson,
a great invalid, never dined, or even drank tea from home.
He never confined his lady or daughters; they well knew
<HI>he</HI> would not pass his afternoons alone. His piety almost
equalled his musical powers; which he never would use,
(except in a private room to his friends,) but in the house
of that God who bestowed them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It used sometimes to be said that Mr. Airson was indolent, and did not sing a fine anthem. When asked if he <HI>thought</HI> himself ill, he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Ask Mrs. Berkley, if I ever in my life, when able to go to church, refused singing any anthem when she desired it of me."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley herself had an idea of not riding a free horse to death.</NOTE>. Handel offered him
eight hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> if he would only sing in
the Oratorios in Lent, but he refused it. It is somewhat
remarkable that the Sunday after his very sudden death,
the late Bishop of Norwich, then Dean of Canterbury, la∣mented
his loss, and celebrated his virtues, in similar words
<PB N="cxliv" REF="152"/>
to those used by the Writer of this Preface in the Canter∣bury
Paper the preceding day, when lamenting the loss of
that cheerful, gay, heavenly-minded friend, whom she
had so far, <HI>en gaieté de coeur,</HI> prevailed on, to accompany her
as far as his hall, in her way to a rout at his next door
neighbour's, saying, <Q REND="inline">"She should attract <HI>all</HI> eyes, and re∣ceive
the thanks of <HI>all</HI> the company."</Q> His gentle, amia∣ble,
eldest daughter, then his <HI>all,</HI> since married to Mr.
Allen of Hereford, her mother and sister being gone, ob∣jected
to his having on his <HI>old</HI> coat, and begging him to
put on his <HI>smart</HI> new one. To this Mrs. Berkeley strongly
objected, saying, <Q REND="inline">"It might, tender as he was, occasion
his taking cold."</Q> Had he gone, she would ever have
reproached herself, as the cause of his universally lamented
death.</P>
<P>It is now more than high time to return from this too
long digression; but the reciting the virtues of beloved, re∣spected
friends, NOW beyond the reach of any other atten∣tions,
is apt, in a heart susceptible of <HI>sincere</HI> regard for
real worth, to give the pen a disorder, which the French
apply to the tongue of one who talks too much, <HI>il a une
fluxe de langue.</HI> The Writer often feels <HI>la fluxe de plume.</HI>
She is sometimes tempted to form the wish of an old friend
of hers, whose husband made her, she being a ready pen∣woman,
write much for him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Well; I do wish I had never
been taught to write at all.</HI>"</Q> Perhaps the readers of this
<PB N="cxlv" REF="153"/>
may form it for her; but it is not necessary to read the
whole of every book; and, to use the language of Holy
Writ, they may <Q REND="inline">"<HI>separate the precious from the vile.</HI>"</Q> They
may read the fine Poetry of the Author, and pass over the
indifferent Prose of the Editor.</P>
<P>Whenever Mr. Monck Berkeley observed any boy, who
boarded at either of the Masters, never invited out to
dinner on holidays, he would say to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"Pray,
my dear Madam, next holiday invite poor such an one,
and such an one. Poor things, they have no relations or
acquaintance here to invite them; and it is very dull for
them. Pray be so good as to let them come here."</Q> This
whether they were his intimates or not. Indeed his inti∣mates
seldom did come, having, most of them, parents in
the church or city, excepting sometimes the Reverend
Cooper Willyams, of Ixning, son of the very worthy Cap∣tain
and Mrs. Willyams, and Captain Gregory, of the
Wiltshire Militia, son of the very learned Reverend Francis
Gregory of Canterbury.</P>
<P>Mr. Thurlow happened to come to school in the begin∣ning
of summer, when all his uncles and aunts, usually re∣sident
in Canterbury during the winter, had retired to
their country residences. Mr. Berkeley soon presented his
humble petition to his Mother, that he might bring Thur∣low
<PB N="cxlvi" REF="154"/>
home sometimes. The request was granted; and the
good disposition, the propriety, the docility, the worthiness
of Mr. Thurlow, soon endeared him so much to Mrs.
Berkeley, that she told her Son <Q REND="inline">"he might bring Thurlow,
but no other boy, without asking her permission, when∣ever
he pleased."</Q> The dear child generally drank tea
every evening in <HI>winter</HI> at Dr. Berkeley's, for in <HI>summer</HI>
they are all
<Q>"over the hills and far away."</Q>
When he was a little more than nine years old, he, like
his friend Mr. Berkeley, was sent to France, for several
months, to acquire the French language in perfection. At
his return he gave a proof of the exquisite sensibility of his
heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A short character and sincere lamentation of this early (not untimely—for GOD's time is ever the best time) death of this beloved young gentleman was in∣serted by his friend Mrs. Berkeley. in Bristow's Canterbury Journal. It fell short in describing his amiability: but the Editor cannot let a beloved friend, whether young or old, quit this mortal scene, without paying that little tribute to their memory—when she sees it neglected by abler pens.</NOTE>. On his arrival in England, he went from Dover,
for a short time, to the house of his kind patron Mr. Hey,
who soon brought him to Canterbury for a day. The in∣stant
he got out of the carriage he flew to the Oaks,
knocked at the door, and begged he might be shown up to
Mrs. Berkeley. Being told she was in bed with a bad head∣ach,
he expressed much concern, and enquired what time she
<PB N="cxlvii" REF="155"/>
would rise; the servant replied, <Q REND="inline">"most likely to dinner;"</Q>
as she never continued in bed, when not exceedingly ill.
At a little before the dinner hour he came; Mrs. Berkeley
not risen. About five in the afternoon he called again,
and, hearing Mrs. Berkeley was not up, begged to see her
own maid, whom he thus addressed: <Q REND="inline">"Pray, be so good
as to go up to Mrs. Berkeley, and give my tenderest love
to her; tell her, I long so much to see her, that I beg
she will permit me to go up, and stand a few minutes
at her bed side, as I shall not be in Canterbury again
these four days."</Q> The servant came up; Mrs. Berkeley
said, <Q REND="inline">"She was very sorry, but hoped she should be able
to see him the next time he came."</Q> The servant replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Dear Madam, he is but a child, and he longs so to see
you, it will half break his heart if he does not."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well,
poor dear child, let him come up then."</Q> The moment
he reached the bed side he caught Mrs. Berkeley's hand,
kissed it, and bursting into tears, kneeled down, and, after
sobbing some time, said, <Q REND="inline">"I hope, my dear Madam, that
you are not dangerously ill."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, with her
usual good spirits in illness, replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Charles
I hope in God I am not. I have the old proverb on my
side, <HI>that nought is never in danger.</HI>"</Q> What would not some
persons give for a son with <HI>such an heart,</HI> and a most ex∣cellent
head? During his last lingering illness, at the
house of his excellent uncle, the amiable, generous, kind∣hearted
<PB N="cxlviii" REF="156"/>
Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, where
every thing that kindness could suggest, and cleverness could
execute, was prepared for him, he would perpetually say,
<Q REND="inline">"Go to next door, with my best regards to Mrs. Berkeley,
and beg her to send me something, whatever she pleases,
out of her store-room; I know I can eat that."</Q> Mr.
Berkeley's earnest request to his Mother, who was to reach
Canterbury after their arrival from Scotland many weeks
before <HI>he</HI> could, being obliged to keep term at the Temple,
was, <Q REND="inline">"Pray learn, and write me word immediately, whe∣ther
Thurlow is returned to England; and, if he is, where
I may find him."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, who used laughingly
to say, she was as obedient a Mother, after Mr. Berkeley
grew up, as she had <HI>made</HI> him a Son in his childhood and
youth, obeyed, and soon executed her commission, and
Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Thurlow came down in the same
chaise, one to the Oaks, the other to Wickham, on Christ∣mas
eve, the most dreadful, cold, snowing day one can re∣member.
Both were almost literally frozen when they ar∣rived
at Dr. Berkeley's; and it was an alarming time be∣fore
they seemed to feel any effect from what was given
them.</P>
<P>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley reproached Mr. Berkeley for not
stopping all night at the PALACE of Mr. Simpson, the Rose
at Sittingbourne, where every comfort, convenience, and
<PB N="cxlix" REF="157"/>
elegance, is to be found from the excellent Master, Mistress,
and the wonderfully worthy Chamber-maid, Mrs. Mary
Humphreys<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As a proof of her worthiness, one night when Dr. Berkeley's family slept there, Mrs. Berkeley's maid said, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, the maid you admire so much for her care and honesty has just now gone up into a gentleman's room, and made him rise, saying, that the under-chamber-maid had mistaken her, and put him into a wrong bed, not sufficiently aired, but that the other was quite ready; begged his pardon for her deputy's carelessness, that she was attending to <HI>your</HI> beds, and thought the other could not have mistaken; but that she could never have forgiven herself had she ever put any one into an half-aired bed."</Q> Oh! that all inn-servants were as careful! The Writer of this Note has twice, once in France, and once in England, suffered from want of such care. This worthy woman's education was singular. She is by birth a native of Wales. Being her father's tenth child, the worthy minister of the parish, having no child of his own, said, he would take her as a <HI>tithe-child.</HI> Under the roof of this humane worthy minister of Christ she grew up, and remained till his death. She certainly does not disgrace her education received under the roof, in the kitchen, for he was too wise to bring up a labourer's daughter as a gentlewoman—to starve, or become a street-walker.</NOTE>. It, however, pleased the mercy of God
that the two friends received not the least injury from this
frightful journey. To adopt the language of the excellent
Monsieur De Pontis in his delightfully entertaining, <HI>although</HI>
pious, Mémoires (which that execrable monster, Voltaire,
has tried to persuade fools and atheists is a fable, notwith∣standing
Madame De Sevigné mentions his death, &amp;c. at
the time), God waited for them elsewhere; for dear Thur∣low
was doomed to fall an early victim to ENGLISH
INHOSPITALITY, as himself related to Dr. Berkeley, whom
he had so frequently heard celebrated the lovely hospitality
<PB N="cl" REF="158"/>
of Scotland: <Q REND="inline">"I owe, said he, my present illness to the want
of it in England. I had been out hunting, was caught
in a violent storm, was quite wet through, called at a
gentleman's, where <HI>I hoped</HI> to have been taken in. I was
offered wine and brandy, the butler called, but no offer
of a bed for a few hours, or of going in to dry my cloaths;
so, after having sat on my horse, the storm over, at the
gate, in cold, wet cloaths, I proceeded to Cambridge, and
went to my rooms; but the cold fixed on my lungs, and
no skill has been able to remove it."</Q> Alas! it not long
after removed him, and robbed his friends and the world of
one of the most amiable-hearted, grateful of human beings.
Adieu, dear youth. <HI>Requiescat in pace.</HI></P>
<P>When Mr. Thurlow was about eleven years old, his un∣cle,
the Bishop of Durham, then Dean of Rochester, when
passing through Canterbury to the sea, and conceiving his
old friend Dr. Berkeley's house to be the best, as he knew
it was the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Berkeley, who seldom leaves home for more than three hours at a time, <HI>i.e.</HI> from six to nine in the evening, nor wishes to see any friend, unless travelling near her, at any other time, used to occasion Mr. Monck Berkeley's often saying, <Q REND="inline">"if my Aunt, Father, and self, were all dead, my Mother would never miss us until the servant announced to her that the urn was carried into the drawing-room."</Q> The <HI>Trio</HI> all agreed to this charge. <Q REND="inline">"On entering it, she would ask, 'Where are they all?' and begin lamenting the loss of us."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley used often to be laughed at by Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frinsham, for declaring that she ate her dinner quite as well alone as in the best company. When Dr. Berkeley, at the age of twenty-four, took from Christ Church the little living of Asgarton, near the Vale of White Horse, he found the house a hovel; and, having been bred in a palace, he loved a good house. However, after laying out near four hundred pounds on the house, and building a fine South wall in the garden, finding it too small to lodge his <HI>few</HI> friends—the Reverend James Hamilton, grandson of Lord Abercorne, a con∣stant delightful visitor, through the whole summer, at Dr. Berkeley's, at Bray, or Acton, until his removal by the late Lord Abercorne to a great living in Ireland, and some others, together with a multitude of <HI>locusts</HI>—finding the vicarage too small, he rented Ley Farm, the country house of Sir Nathaniel Nash. Until his removal to Bray, the Bishop of Durham, then Curate of Wantage, was a very constant frequent visitor there.</NOTE>cheapest inn in Canterbury, drove to the
<PB N="cli" REF="159"/>
Oaks. No sooner was his arrival notified to Mrs. Berkeley,
than she ordered Mr. Wrightson to go and tell his Master
a person wanted to speak to him. Mrs. Berkeley conjured
him to permit her to send to Dr. Beauvoir's for dear
Charles. Dr. Berkeley, with his usual good-will to man
and child, complied. John (now Mr. Wrightson), as the
best messenger, was dispatched, to beg that Miss Beauvoir
would order Master Thurlow to be arrayed in his Sunday
garb, and posted off to Dr. Berkeley's, notifying the cause.
Mrs. Berkeley ordered Mr. Wrightson to call out his Mas∣ter
when the little man arrived. Accordingly, in a few
minutes, Dr. Berkeley, looking like a beautiful guardian∣angel
of those <Q REND="inline">"<HI>little ones</HI>"</Q> mentioned by our blessed Lord,
entered the drawing-room, leading in his little <HI>protegé,</HI>
whom he presented to the Dean. <Q REND="inline">"Here, my old friend, is
a very good little man, who is very nearly related to you."</Q>
<PB N="clii" REF="160"/>
The Dean looked about as <HI>éveillé</HI> as usual, stroked his
head, and asked him how he liked school, and some other
questions generally put to children. In the afternoon he
told him to stand by him at the card-table; and when the
time arrived for Charles to make his bow and return to
Dr. Beauvoir's, the Dean, who had won about a guinea,
<HI>generously</HI> presented poor dear Charles with <HI>two and sixpence;</HI>
for which he made one of his graceful French bows, and re∣tired.
They never met again, until they met in the regions
of departed spirits. <HI>Some</HI> persons have even doubted whether
poor Thurlow could be found <HI>worthy</HI> of a place to behold
the glory of the <Q REND="inline">"ANGEL of the Church of Durham."</Q> The
resemblance in face and person of Mr. Thurlow to the Bi∣shop
was remarkably striking to all the company, allowing
only that the tempers and dispositions of his mind were
entirely Lynch and Wake, which threw a look of benevo∣lence
into his features and countenance, which did <HI>not ap∣pear</HI>
in the Bishop's.</P>
<P>About the year 1786 there died at Canterbury a very
excellent young man, an old school-fellow of Mr. Berkeley's,
Mr. George Hasted, son of the Author of the History of
Kent. On Mr. Berkeley's arrival, in vacation-time, Mrs.
Berkeley asked her Son <Q REND="inline">"if he was not afflicted at the
death of his old intimate, George Hasted?"</Q> He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"I was very sorry for the death of so very worthy a young
man; but, my dear Mother, <HI>he</HI> was <HI>never</HI> an intimate
<PB N="cliii" REF="161"/>
of mine. HE was much too studious and diligent for <HI>us;</HI>
was in quite another set: he pitied us for our idleness
and folly. George Hasted would never go to cricket, or
to Bingley (where the King's scholars swim in summer)
till he had done every tittle of his exercise. We all set
off, and left it to chance to get our exercise done, or, if
not done, get a sound flogging."</Q> Had Mr. Berkeley, when
a boy, been told that nobody could learn Latin or Greek,
he would have studied night and day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every night, just before the family went to supper, Mrs. Berkeley used to go into both her little boys rooms, to see whether they lay straight, and in a wholesome posture, which is of more consequence to children than people in general are aware of. One night, when Mr. Berkeley was about five years old, on entering the room, she found his fine eyes wide open. She asked him <Q REND="inline">"how he came to be awake, and how he <HI>dared</HI> to have his eyes open?"</Q>—being always ordered to shut them when in bed, or in a dark room. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have not been asleep at all: I have been <HI>racking</HI> my brain to try to make a syllable with∣out a vowel, because you have always told me it was impossible to do it—and if I could have done it, it would have made me very happy to have come and told you of it."</Q></NOTE>. Tell him, from
five years old, of any thing that it was impossible to accom∣plish,
and he was indefatigable in labouring at it: his bro∣ther
just the reverse. Perhaps never were two children,
born of the same Father and Mother, more different: Mr.
Berkeley would add, <Q REND="inline">"Always excepting <HI>my Mother</HI> and
<HI>her only sister.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, gay, lively, volatile, yet wonderfully
solid; his brother, sedate, grave, yet wonderfully witty;
<PB N="cliv" REF="162"/>
both Poets from the time they could articulate at all; both
enthusiastic admirers of music. Neither Mr. Berkeley nor
his brother were ever suffered to go to Bingley to swim,
without their Mother's leave. Mr. Berkeley used to come
regularly, when the masters had given permission to the
boys, with his request.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"I am afraid you will be drowned.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, I shall not.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Do any of the upper school go?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Who? Does Mr. J. Tucker or Mr. Til∣den go?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, then, go if you will; but I am afraid.
You know Herbert Packe would have been drowned, if
young Loftie had not saved him.—(Down he sat, and
took up a book.)—Well, child, why do not you go?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, I shall not go.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why not, now that I have given you leave?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, I shall not indeed.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, what can I do more? Would you
have me conduct you thither?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clv" REF="163"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; but I shall not take <HI>such</HI> a leave.</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, what leave would you have?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, say, in <HI>your good humoured sweet</HI> voice,
Yes, <HI>my dear Berkeley,</HI> you may go to Bingley this afternoon,
and I had <HI>rather</HI> you went than stayed at home; or else
I shall not go on any account."</Q></P>
<P>His brother coming with the same request, and obtain∣ing
the forced permission, would reply, <Q REND="inline">"Thank you, my
dear Mamma,"</Q> fly out of the room, scamper down stairs,
and set off, lest the permission should be recalled, leaving
the door wide open, and dart away under St. John's Arch.
When passed <HI>that,</HI> he thought himself quite safe from being
remanded. Yet, he was governed by a silk thread, whilst
his dear brother required <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a threefold cord.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when a lad too old for correction, would,
when his Mother desired him not to go to such a place, or
do such a thing, immediately reply, <Q REND="inline">"Well, then, my
dear Madam, <HI>command</HI> me."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Command you, my
dear; I do not love commanding. I never wish to exert
my authority: I <HI>desire</HI> that you will <HI>not</HI> do it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes,
I must; all the desiring in the world <HI>will not do.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"That
is very strange."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I cannot help it. Why won't you
say, Berkeley, <HI>I command</HI> you not to do it?"</Q>—The magic
words, by his earnest desire, being uttered, he would say,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, now I am happy; now I have not the least wish in the
world to do it; would not do it for any sum of money."</Q>
When he was about thirteen years old, the news of the day
<PB N="clvi" REF="164"/>
was, a run-a-way match of a young man of rank. A gentle∣man
visiting at Dr. Berkeley's, turned to Mr. Monck Berke∣ley,
and said, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, in three or four years, young 'squire,
<HI>you</HI> will be playing the same prank."</Q> It is impossible for
any one then present to forget the dignified solemnity of
Mr. Berkeley's countenance, whilst he uttered the follow∣ing
reply: <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, <HI>I hope</HI> not. GOD FORBID that I
should ever do so <HI>important</HI> a thing as MARRY without the
<HI>full</HI> consent of my Parents."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was certainly a very extraordinary proof of
the blessed effects of education. A witty friend of the
Editor's used to say, <Q REND="inline">"If God will but send Mrs. Berkeley's
children a tolerable pair of eyes, and all their limbs, she
asks no more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This lady might have added, good understandings; for the Editor, when a young woman, probably after the death of a young gentleman who had been tenderly attached to her from his age of twelve, and hers of eleven, he at Eton, she at Mrs. Sheeles, until he, at near nineteen, died a Gentleman Commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, used frequently to tell her mother, <Q REND="inline">"She feared to marry, lest, if she should have children, they should have weak under∣standings, which would break her heart."</Q> To which Mrs. Frinsham used to reply: <Q REND="inline">"Surely it is the oddest idea that ever entered into the mind of woman. I never thought of any such thing. Thank God, none of my family have ever been fools; nor, I hope, knaves; and why, if you have children, they should be such, I cannot conceive. I am sure <HI>you</HI> will <HI>never</HI> marry a fool."</Q> God heard the Editor's prayers; for certainly her dear children were <HI>not</HI> FOOLS.</NOTE>: she will trim them and twist them into
handsome faces, and fine figures; but she is not up to
<HI>making eyes.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley, when grown up, used often
to divert his Father and friends, by drawing his Mother's
<PB N="clvii" REF="165"/>
character—she present. He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"My Mother has
<HI>no</HI> mercy on her own sex; but little for the other. Every
fault, every defect, related of any young man, she in∣stantly
replies, 'Poor creature, that was his <HI>mother's</HI>
fault.' In short, she lays every fault, of every kind, ex∣cept
not writing a good Greek epigram, or Latin oration,
on a man's Mother: but she was an early studier of Lord
Halifax's Advice to a Daughter."</Q> He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"My
Mother, I believe, keeps a folio sheet of paper, with all
the virtues of her friends emblazoned on one side, and
their faults on the other. Whilst they act worthily and
honourably, you never suppose they have any fault or
foible; let them but act unworthily to any one, and the
paper is reversed, and you hear all their faults. My
Mother always carries a <HI>little</HI> cat-o-nine-tails in her
pocket; and if any fool blasphemes or ridicules Scrip∣ture,
out it comes, and he is very speedily made
the laugh of all the company. If my Mother was
not my Mother, I would bribe her with five hun∣dred
pounds to become my friend."</Q> To which Mrs.
Berkeley used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"You varlet, you know it would
be all in vain; for <HI>your Mother</HI> would not be bribed to
flatter Royalty any more than your Worship, who, thank
God, will not condescend to flatter any one, although
you often, by your benevolence and great personal since∣rity,
are led to cultivate intimacies with <HI>vaut-riens,</HI> male
and female, some of rank among your own relations."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clviii" REF="166"/>
Of Mr. Monck Berkeley's genius many of those who have
redde what he has written may be competent judges. To
attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability, generosity,
and nobleness of his heart, and the wonderful strength and
soundness of his judgement, even in early youth, requires
the knowledge of the Editor, and the pen of his favourite
Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>His attentions to the poor, from his childhood, were un∣remitting.
The arguments of his Mother to dissuade
him from wasting his alms on common beggars, those hor∣rid
robbers of the honest labouring poor, were all in vain.
His answer always was, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I am fully con∣vinced
of the truth of your reasoning; and, I do believe,
I never did relieve a common beggar in my life that was
not a <HI>vaut-rein;</HI> yet, should I ever hear that any poor
creature had perished, who had asked charity of me, and
I had not relieved him, I know I never could forgive
myself through life."</Q> So well was his character known
to these wretches, that they frequently asked in the village
near which his Father resided, <Q REND="inline">"If the 'Squire was at home,
for if he is not, it is not worth while to turn out of the
way to the house, as the Doctor and the Lady never <HI>give
any thing to</HI> POOR TRAVELLERS."</Q> The fact is certain,
that they never came but when Mr. Berkeley was in
the country, which occasioned Mrs. Berkeley's telling her
Son, <HI>that they were his visitors.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="clix" REF="167"/>
Mr. Berkeley, as has been observed above, was remarka∣bly
generous, and had what is commonly called a <HI>princely</HI>
spirit. His beautiful brother was very saving, and even co∣vetous;
he never parted with his money, but to the poor,
to whom he was very liberal indeed. So careful was he
of his money, that it used to be a diversion to his Father
and Aunt to borrow sixpence of him, and then tell him
that they were poor, and could not pay him: he would go
to his Mother, and desire her to <HI>talk</HI> to them, and tell
them, <Q REND="inline">"that it was not <HI>honest</HI> to borrow of people, and not
pay them again, and that <HI>absolutely</HI> he could not afford to
lose his money."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, when a child, once went and sold
his buckles, to relieve a person in distress. When at Eton,
being unable to relieve a very large poor family near Bray∣wood
Side, to whom his Father had been exceedingly
bountiful, and the family being at Canterbury, he wrote to
his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I beg of you to send five or three guineas to
these poor creatures. My cousin," (the very worthy Re∣verend
J. Hayes, <HI>then</HI> second son of James Hayes, Esquire,
Berkeley's amiable protector and director when he went to
Eton,) "and myself have given them all the money that
we have; but they are very poor still."</Q> Not getting an
answer as soon as he wished, he risqued a flogging, and
contrived, in company with an equally daring friend, to
scamper over to Cookham; there he sold his little poney,
<PB N="clx" REF="168"/>
and sent them the money. A youth going from Canter∣bury
School to Oxford, when Mr. Berkeley was about
twelve years old, he presented him with his watch, chain,
and seal; for which being sharply reproved by his Mother,
he sweetly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I am but a boy, and he is
going to be a man; and it must be unpleasant to him not
to have a watch, and I know he cannot afford to buy
one, and I can contrive to shift without one."</Q> Such
was ever the nature of this lovely young man.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was, from his early youth, destined for the
Bar; where, had it pleased God to have spared his life,
and blessed him with health, he would, no doubt, have
reached the <HI>acme</HI> of his profession<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Monck Berkeley, going one evening to visit his amiable, kind friend Mrs. Horne, then on a visit at her father's, the very worthy, sensible Philip Burton, Esquire; that gentleman desired the Bishop and Mrs. Horne to tell Dr. Berkeley, from him, <Q REND="inline">"that he never saw a young man quite so likely to shine eminently at the bar, as his son;"</Q> and obligingly added, <Q REND="inline">"I have been near fifty years in Westminster Hall, and I have very rarely failed in my sentence of those who would succeed, and who fail."</Q> It is well known that Mr. Burton was a man of very superior understanding, and a wonderfully agreeable pleasant companion.</NOTE>; for all who heard him
speak pronounced him <HI>eminently</HI> qualified to make a distin∣guished
figure, unless his very strict ideas of honesty had pre∣vented
it. In early youth he had been earnestly requested
by his Mother, when arguing, never, for the sake of argument,
<PB N="clxi" REF="169"/>
to improve in logic, to undertake the <HI>wrong</HI> side of the question,
lest it might warp his mind. He had ever most religiously
adhered to this advice; and, in more advanced years, always
declared, if he lived to speak at the bar, which he early deter∣mined
he would not do until he had completed his twenty∣eighth
year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley had been often pressed by his learned friends to break this resolution; but his constant reply was, <Q REND="inline">"So determined am I to adhere to it, that I will not keep my last term at the Temple until the term before;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"if <HI>ever</HI> a man ceases to be a coxcomb, or a fool, it is, surely, after having served <HI>four</HI> apprenticeships to folly and nonsense."</Q></NOTE>, he would tell every client that applied to him,
that, if he found his cause to be an unjust one, he would
desert it, <HI>even</HI> in Westminster Hall. Mr. Berkeley had also
firmly resolved never to plead <HI>against</HI> the fatherless, the
widow, or the clergy; and always to plead <HI>gratis</HI> for them,
if their circumstances required it.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that although Mr. Berkeley was
<HI>highly</HI> indebted to <HI>what</HI> we commonly call Nature, with
strict propriety to the God of Nature, for a very uncom∣monly
fine understanding, quick ready wit, and, what does
not always accompany it, a very extraordinary strength and
soundness of judgement, so as often to occasion persons to
remark, that he had all the brilliancy of Bishop Berkeley's
imagination, and all the sound, strong judgement of Mr.
Cherry, of whom the great Charles Leslie, the celebrated
controversial writer, used to say, he thought God had not
<PB N="clxii" REF="170"/>
bestowed better judgement on man since the days of Solo∣mon.
When Mr. Berkeley, with all his great vivacity in
early youth, often acted with the supremest caution, Mrs.
Berkeley used, to the great diversion of Dr. Berkeley, to
say, <Q REND="inline">"It was a happy thing for her children, that she in∣troduced
a little LEAD into the family; for, although pea∣cocks
feathers were exquisitely beautiful, yet, unless
tipped with a <HI>little</HI> weight, they naturally flew away to the
Moon."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley owed much also to education, to principles
very early instilled into him; to which he professed, long
before, and during his last illness, he owed his greatest
happiness in <HI>life,</HI> his <HI>only</HI> hope in the prospect of <HI>death,</HI> un∣til
he, through the free sovereign grace of God, and the
rich mercy of Christ, arrived, by the instrumentality of a
most excellent book, to assurance of faith, feeling the <HI>full
force</HI> of that glorious promise of EMANUEL, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</HI>"</Q> He was enabled
to <HI>trust,</HI> to <HI>go;</HI> and HAPPILY found, as <HI>all true penitents will,</HI>
a most gracious reception. May all true penitents be ena∣bled
to make the trial, and they will most certainly rejoice
through the countless ages of a <HI>blissful</HI> ETERNITY. But, alas!
our adored Redeemer himself says, <Q REND="inline">"YE WILL NOT COME
UNTO ME, THAT YE MAY HAVE LIFE."</Q> The Writer is well
aware of the <HI>ridicule, contempt, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> that will be <HI>liberally</HI>
bestowed on her, on account of <HI>many</HI> things in this preface;
<PB N="clxiii" REF="171"/>
yet, ever bearing in mind the admonition of an eminently pious
Mother, never to be ashamed of that God, who lived, who
died, to redeem her; ever remembering his own <HI>emphatic</HI>
admonition, <Q REND="inline">"Whosoever shall be ashamed of ME, and of
My words, in this ADULTEROUS and sinful generation,
of him (or <HI>her</HI>) shall the Son of Man be ashamed when
he cometh in his own glory,"</Q> &amp;c. At the age of seven∣teen,
going to spend a few weeks with a near relation,
her Mother said, <Q REND="inline">"The first thing for which you will be
laughed at, is going to church on Sunday in the after∣noon;
yet <HI>never</HI> omit it. Your Mother has been laughed
to scorn for it years ago."</Q> Then the above cited text
was repeatedly <HI>enforced:</HI> and although the Writer, natu∣rally
the most shy of human beings amongst strangers, al∣ways,

little insignificant figure behind the door, that nobody
might look at her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So as generally to occasion her witty younger sister, of course following her into the room when visiting with their Mother, to say <Q REND="inline">"For pity's sake, my dear Miss Frinsham, do not go into the room looking as if you had stolen your cloaths."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley used sadly to lament, after her mother's death, that <HI>she</HI> was the <HI>eldest</HI> sister.</NOTE>; yet the first Sunday of her visit she
encountered the loud laugh of ten or eleven gentlemen and
ladies, for setting off to afternoon prayers. The lady at
whose house she was on a visit, said, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! the young la∣dy's
Mother has brought her up with <HI>wonderfully</HI> strict
notions of God and Religion; so I dare say she <HI>will</HI> go."</Q>
<HI>Go</HI> the young lady certainly did; but she never remembers
<PB N="clxiv" REF="172"/>
to have suffered more in her <HI>whole</HI> life, than in that <HI>first</HI>
struggle in the service of her blessed Master, of her own
<HI>never dying</HI> soul. Living many years in the first company
cured that painful timidity. Conversing much with learned
and good men soon enabled her to become more than a
<HI>silent</HI> advocate for the honour of her blessed Master, when
ridiculed by foolish scoffers; insomuch as often to occasion
Mr. Monck Berkeley to say to his Father and friends, <Q REND="inline">"Few
things delight me more than hearing my Mother trim an
Infidel. Some Deistical fellow begins spouting out his
nonsensical blasphemy to <HI>amuse</HI> the company.—On he
goes, without interruption; for I make it a point never
to say a word, <HI>well</HI> knowing what he is going to meet
with.—At length, down goes my Mother's needle-work;
she begins, and in a few words turns the laugh of all the
company upon him, and the poor wretch never opens his
mouth any more the remainder of the evening."</Q></P>
<P>This is a proof of the fulfilment of this promise of Christ
to his faithful servants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor, at the age of twenty-two, was asked, by a very near relation of her own, a single man, of vast fortune, universally esteemed one of the first scholars in England, <Q REND="inline">"Why she was not a Papist, for the Papists required not the belief of any thing so contrary to reason as the doctrine of the Trinity, which he was persuaded she did believe."</Q> It pleased God to enable her to make him, a first-rate scholar, she an unlettered young woman, such an answer as immediately silenced him, and astonished the whole of the company that sat at table. To God be all the glory. This <HI>worthy wight</HI> lived many years, never spending near as many hundreds <HI>per annum</HI> as he possessed thou∣sands. A few years ago the Editor was called upon to put on an old black lustring—he being gone where his gold cannot follow him; and, alas! he had not sent any of it before him. His nephew, however, has made it fly in all directions, in all countries. The last time the Editor was abroad—at Lisle (commonly called Petit Paris) all her acquaintance were lamenting she had not arrived a little sooner, as her relation had been giving such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>êtes,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will give you a mouth, and wis∣dom,</HI>

As Mrs. Berkeley is not an Eliza Carter or a Mrs.
Montagu, two of her respected old friends, but an unlettered
female, who lost a learned and wise Father when she was eleven
years old, who had set his heart on cultivating the minds
of his daughters, had God spared his life until their leaving
the school of that throughly amiable, accomplished woman,
the excellent Mrs. Sheeles; but, alas! they had been in
Queen's Square but one year, before he went to hear those
blessed words, <Q REND="inline">"Well done, thou good and faithful ser∣vant,"</Q>
&amp;c. as perhaps one of the best, the most vigi∣lant
parish priests any where to be found, even half a cen∣tury
ago, for so long has he been removed. HE had redde
St. Paul's Epistles to Timothy and Titus with good effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the year 1755, the Reverend Dr. Dodwell was blessed with a curate, who followed the example of Mr. Frinsham, Mr. Ratcliffe, fellow of Queen's College, Oxford. Few days passed without his visiting some house in the pa∣rish, chiefly the cottages where he examined and instructed the poor children, and generally ignorant mother; admonishing them if they neglected going to church, exhorting them to attend at the altar. He was a chearful, pleasant, unassuming, young man. He died about two years ago, on a college living; the county wherein it was situated is not at present recollected, but <HI>he</HI> is not forgotten by his Master.</NOTE>;
for he never suffered sin on any of his parishioners, how∣ever
<PB N="clxvi" REF="174"/>
high their rank or station, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>unrebuked.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"He was in∣stant

<P>It is hoped the introduction of a little anecdote concern∣ing
the zeal of this worthy gentleman, for the salvation of
his flock, may be excused. The wife of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, a
man of good fortune, in every sense of the word <HI>a fine lady,</HI>
was a little talked of as having a partiality for one of her
men-servants. The excellent vicar took an early opportu∣nity,
when he knew her husband was absent, to call upon
her; finding her alone, he soon began the subject. She
heard him with seeming attention for some time; at length
she replied, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frinsham, you may save yourself any
farther trouble about <HI>me;</HI> for I do <HI>assure</HI> you, Sir, that I
mind what you say no more than the COALS on that
fire."</Q> Mr. Frinsham mildly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,
I dare say, that often, during the course of my ministry,
<HI>I may</HI> have met with many as inattentive hearers as your∣self;
but I must tell you, that <HI>you</HI> are the <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>only</HI>
person, who ever told me so."</Q> Then taking up his hat,
he made a bow, and told her, he hoped God would, in
time, bring her to a better state of mind. He had the
mortification to see her some years after <HI>die,</HI> as she had
<HI>lived;</HI> but he had the consolation offered to <HI>watchful</HI> pastors
in Ezekiel, chapter xxxiii.</P>
<P>When the late Earl of Bute took Waltham Place, soon
after his arrival, Mr. Frinsham, with some other gentlemen
<PB N="clxvii" REF="175"/>
of the neighbourhood, made him a visit. At taking leave,
Lord Bute said to Mr. Frinsham, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I hope that we
shall be good neighbours, as I have taken this house
<HI>solely</HI> on account of your excellent amiable character."</Q>
Perhaps one of the most beautiful letters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is possible that some of Lord Bute's letters to Mr. Frinsham may some time or other be presented to the publick; they will serve to shew what Lord Bute <HI>then</HI> was.</NOTE> ever penned was
by Lord Bute, on the death of, as he termed him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that
dear delightful excellent friend.</HI>"</Q> The Peer and the Pastor
generally met on the hill, or at the vale below, every day.
Mr. Frinsham was as witty as he was good; in his youth
the idol of all his acquaintance, as what is termed the fid∣dle
of the company, and to his latest day the most cheerful
person of a large circle. He expired with a smile on his
benign countenance, without even drawing a single sigh, at
the age of fifty-four.</P>
<P>It is hoped, that the following little tribute of a grateful
child to the best of Fathers will be pardoned. A few lines
shall suffice. Not long after his obtaining priest's orders he
became curate of Beaconsfield in Bucks, to a <HI>poor</HI> man of large
fortune, but so weak in his understanding, that, when Mr.
Frinsham was one Sunday confined with a rash, Mr. N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>attempted</HI>
to do the duty, which he <HI>could not get through,</HI> and
<PB N="clxviii" REF="176"/>
therefore came down and went home<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May God have pardoned the wickedness of the Prelate who admitted <HI>such</HI> a <HI>being</HI> into the Church of Christ, to get the emoluments of a family living. It is <HI>seldom</HI> seen, I believe, that an almost idiot at <HI>twenty-four</HI> becomes a man of sense at thirty-four. A buck, a blood, a Newmarket jockey, made a priest of the Most High God at twenty-four, does often, by thirty-four, or forty-four, begin to feel the value of his own and the souls committed to his charge. But the Wise King assures us, the <Q REND="inline">"braying in a mortar"</Q> will not make a fool wise. Surely, in that instance, the Presbyterians are wiser than our excellent Church. They, I believe, seldom ordain any man, such as their ordination is, until thirty. Our blessed Master, God incarnate, began not his own ministry until the age of thirty; his precursor, John the Baptist, not until twenty-seven; yet our Church, wise in every thing else, permits poor shatter-brained boys, of twenty-two and an half, to go, and solemnly <HI>lie to the Holy Ghost,</HI> (see Ordina∣tion Office,) that they may get forty pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> and scamper after a pack of hounds.</NOTE>. The living being
then on sale, Mr. Frinsham much wished his father to pur∣chase
it for him; the old gentleman stood for about a hun∣dred
and fifty or two hundred pounds. The Principal and
Fellows of Magdalene College, Oxford, hearing of it, instantly
paid down the sum demanded; and, of course, for ever pre∣cluded
Mr. Frinsham from becoming rector, where he was
only, not adored as curate; so powerfully had his persuasions
wrought on the people of that place, that the wheeler, the
blacksmith, the millener, yea, every trader, quitted their
occupation, to attend Wednesday, Friday, and Saints'-day
prayers, so much as frequently to occasion passengers en∣quiring
if there was any great wedding, that so many per∣sons
were coming out of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="clxix" REF="177"/>
Mr. Frinsham being what was called a Tory, and all his
own and his lady's considerable relations, who could prefer
him, being Whigs; he never obtained any more impor∣tant
preferment than the vicarage of White Waltham, a
parish of sixteen miles round, in Windsor Forest, of which
his very learned and worthy successor, the Reverend Dr.
Dodwell, Canon of Salisbury, and Archdeacon of Berks,
said he never made fifty pounds a year. Thus are many
excellent ministers of Christ provided for in <HI>this</HI> world,
enough to make them take up the language of the great
apostle St. Paul, and say, <Q REND="inline">"If in <HI>this life only</HI> we have hope
in Christ, we are of ALL men most miserable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Frinsham used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"I hope I am humbly thankful to God for a very comfortable fortune; but I thank him still more for that tem∣per, that, had I been an alms-man with five pounds a year, I am sure I should have been an <HI>happy</HI> man."</Q> His unworthy Daughter feels herself much more favoured by Providence in inheriting her Father's disposition than the comfortable fortune he bequeathed to her; humbly thankful, she trusts, for both blessings, unmerited by her. Her Mother used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"Surely, <HI>thou art</HI> the happiest little creature under the sun—as like your dear Father in temper as in face. Thou must meet with a wonderful lot in life, if thou doest not go contented and joyous to thy grave."</Q> The Editor trusts, by becoming daily more resigned to the BLESSED WILL of the ALL-WISE
disposer of ALL events, to feel that her Mother judged aright. She has ever delighted in being able to apply to herself that pleasant line of Mr. Addison's, in one of his beautiful hymns, set to music by her old master Mr. Sheeles:<Q><L>"Nor is the <HI>least</HI> a cheerful heart,</L>
<L>"Which tastes those gifts with joy."</L></Q> </NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clxx" REF="178"/>
Mr. Frinsham, perhaps naturally the most contented-tempered
of the fallen children of Adam, and the most
hospitable, although he wished not for a larger income,
wished for a larger, better house, in which to entertain his
numerous friends and acquaintance. Rich and poor, high
and low, all ate and drank at his house. The vicarage
house at White Waltham was literally a very large old
barn, with small rooms on each side. The kitchen, how∣ever,
was not very small, and was payed with curious Ro∣man
bricks, which might have consoled his grandson, Mr.
Monck Berkeley, an enthusiastical antiquary.</P>
<P>An answer of Mr. Frinsham to a letter written by his re∣lation
Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to Mr. Frinsham, offering him a living

I shall therefore contentedly remain in my old clayed barn, until Providence removes me to the realms of bliss."</Q> Lord Bute used personally, as the Editor well remembers, when playing cards, spending the evening under that very humble roof—the top of Mr. Frinsham's wig just touched the middle beam—to say, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, if ever I have power, the first man on earth for whom I will exert it, shall be yourself."</Q> And breakfasting with his lady at Mr. Frinsham's, the morning he quitted Waltham Place, he looked out of one of the sashes at his late dwelling, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I grieve to leave it; Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> might, if he pleased, have enabled me to continue; but, I hope, we shall soon meet again."</Q> They never did on earth; Mr. Frinsham dying before Lord Bute returned from Scot∣land.

<PB N="clxxi" REF="179"/>
to vote always as Lord H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> should direct him, is still
carefully preserved. His son-in-law, the late, as indepen∣dent
and spirited, Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury,
used to say, it merited to be written in letters of gold. Such
were the WHIG ministers of George the Second.</P>
<P>It is somewhat remarkable, that Mr. Frinsham never met
with any serious affliction through life. The loss of his
beautiful mother, when he was five years old, was so sup∣plied
by an excellent housekeeper of his father's, that he
scarcely felt it; and the death of his worthy father, at
the age of eighty-one, not long before his own death, was
an event to be expected at that age, although he died, as
before mentioned, by casualty. Mr. Frinsham was in∣terred
close to his honoured father-in-law, Francis Cherry,
Esquire, within the railed burial place in Shottesbrooke
church-yard. He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"I am God's creature;
he sent me into the world <HI>when</HI> he pleased, and he
will take me out <HI>how</HI> he pleases: and I am sure
it will be at the <HI>best</HI> time, in the <HI>best</HI> way."</Q> He dreaded
nothing in life so much as losing the best of wives, and
the being left with two little girls, whom he humoured in
<HI>every thing</HI> not in itself wrong.</P>
<P>Some proofs how much Mr. Berkeley was indebted to
education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a
lad, a youth, and a man, when it is considered that he was
astonishingly proud whilst a child.</P>
<P><PB N="clxxii" REF="180"/>
When Mr. Monck Berkeley was aged three years and
two months, his father went to reside at Acton near Lon∣don,
a large living, presented to him by his ONLY patron
through life, the excellent Archbishop Secker, and which
he so nobly resigned, to a man, who, after making him
repair the tithe barn, and letting him have about five hun∣dred
pounds' worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hun∣dred
and eighty pounds—(amongst which was a harpsichord,
that cost Bishop Berkeley seventy guineas, for <HI>four pounds</HI>—Mrs.
Berkeley objected; but the Doctor, with his wonted
generosity, said, <Q REND="inline">"he hated disputes among clergy;"</Q> and
therefore permitted him to have it at his own price)—after
suffering the house to stand empty from Michaelmas to the
end of April—came upon him with a long bill for dila∣pidations,
and protested a draught drawn on him by Dr.
Berkeley for the money for the furniture. This naturally
exasperated the too generous mind that had been the ac∣tual
presenter of the living; for no power on earth, no ho∣nour,
could have compelled any one to resign it. But Dr.
Berkeley one day asking the Archbishop if his Grace meant
he should resign Action on becoming Prebendary of Canter∣bury,
his reply was, <Q REND="inline">"Don't be in haste. You must talk
one day or other with Lord Hardwicke about it."</Q> Before
any conference with Lord Hardwicke, the good Archbishop
died; and the nice honour of Dr. Berkeley, without ever
even seeing Lord Hardwick, made him resign it to a cousin∣german
of his Lordship—a very different man from his
<PB N="clxxiii" REF="181"/>
noble relation. A very intimate friend of Dr. Berkeley's,
the excellent <HI>throughly</HI> Honourable and Reverend Mr. Ha∣milton
of Taplow, felt such resentment, that he conjured
Dr. Berkeley to post the <HI>man</HI> every where. Mr. Ha∣milton
had one excellent rule; he never would call any
man a gentleman, if in any instance he had acted unlike a
gentleman.</P>
<P>In a very few days after the arrival of the family at Ac∣ton,
Mrs. Berkeley heard a most violent stamping and
screaming of her then only child. On enquiry into the
cause, it was found to be, that Master Berkeley would not
go to bed up the back stairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"What ails him?</Q></P>
<P>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, you know, Madam, there is only one
stair-case at Bray. But Master Berkeley says there are
two here; and he observes, that my Master, and you,
and all visitors, go up the great stair-case, and <HI>only</HI> the
servants up the back stairs; and that he is as good a gen∣tleman
as his Papa, although he is not so old; and that
he will not go up the back stairs."</Q></P>
<P>An order was immediately made, and strictly adhered to,
that he was not, for a <HI>whole</HI> week, (a long time for a crea∣ture
of three feet high,) to presume, in the day time, to
go up or down the great stair-case to the dressing-room, to
his Mamma, to read or play.</P>
<P><PB N="clxxiv" REF="182"/>
When about four years old, Mr. Berkeley received a smart
trimming, for a speech to a once famous apothecary in Lon∣don,
who had retired to Acton, Mr. Sawtell, whose ap∣pearance
was rather against him. He attended Dr. Berke∣ley
when unwell, and Charles Stanley Monck, of Grange
Gormonde, Esquire, ill about four months at Dr. Berke∣ley's
with the whooping cough, which he brought from
Eton School, and communicated to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>poor</HI> is introduced on account of his very severe sufferings for more than seven months. Dr. Berkeley, having never been at any school, had, unluckily, escaped all those disorders which children, together with many other benefits, generally get at good schools. The whooping-cough is a tremendous disorder, indeed, to adults—Dr. Berkeley could not exist without going into fresh air every three or four days. It cost him more than an hundred guineas. The agonies suffered by the Editor during some parts of that time were ex∣ceedingly great. Laughing constantly brought on a violent fit of coughing. Innumerable were the times that the Editor has sat trembling with anguish, ex∣pecting that her beloved partner would expire hanging on the window; his only hope of relief being to throw up the sash, and hang out at it, gasping for breath. Mr. James Hamilton, and the as <HI>witty Samuel Horne,</HI> spent the sum∣mer with him. Mrs. Berkeley used to protest, she would <HI>turn them both out of doors,</HI> if they would not bottle up their wit, saying, <Q REND="inline">"she would send for two mutes."</Q> She used seriously to conjure them not to make Dr. Berkeley laugh. None can laugh at this account, who has ever had the distress of seeing an adult under the paroxysms of the whooping cough. An old friend of Mrs. Berkeley's, more advanced in life than Dr. Berkeley, often fell senseless on the floor, the late Rev. Mr. Chapman, the beloved friend of the late Dr. Booth, Dean of Windsor.</NOTE>poor Dr. Berkeley and
his little boy. This proud descendant of fallen Adam thus
accosted him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, if you were ever to stay here to din∣ner,
you must dine in the servants' hall, for you cannot
<PB N="clxxv" REF="183"/>
be fit company for my Papa."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, ready to
sink with shame, flew to Mrs. Berkeley, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Surely,
that chit is the proudest little being on earth. I must now
really ask the poor man one day to dinner, to shew
that he has not heard any thing of the kind from you
or me."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was always told, that a gentleman must
never do mean or shabby actions. He <HI>reasoned</HI> on the
matter, and, in early infancy, drew such <HI>wonderful</HI> conclu∣sions
as those just mentioned.</P>
<P>That both Mr. Berkeley and his Brother were, in <HI>very
very</HI> early youth exceedingly proud is absolutely certain, in
their different ways; and that both became remarkably
humble, by their Mother's adhering closely to the direc∣tions
given to parents in that wonderful book the Proverbs
of Solomon, is equally certain.</P>
<P>The exquisite loveliness of Mr. Monck Berkeley's nature
led him, from an infant, to look with pity on all below
him; but his dear Brother naturally looked with contempt.
One day, when very young, going in the coach with their
Mother to Marlow, as they passed a remarkably small, mean∣looking
cottage at the foot of the hill, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My
dear Mamma, look there: did you ever see so miserable
a looking hut? What kind of <HI>creatures</HI> must they be that
<PB N="clxxvi" REF="184"/>
live in it?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley threw terror into her coun∣tenance,
and said, <Q REND="inline">"ROBERT! what have I just heard you
say? Do you dare to despise any of your fellow creatures,
or any mean-looking habitation? Have not you often
redde in the Bible what our blessed Saviour said, 'The
foxes—(Now go on; he did so)—have holes, and the
birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has not
where to lay his head."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why did he come upon
earth?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"To save sinners."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, such a poor, proud,
little wretch as you. And are you not very naughty to
say what you have just said?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, indeed, Mamma;
and if God will forgive me <HI>this once,</HI> I will never do so
again whilst I live."</Q></P>
<P>Once passing a little chimney-sweeper, about his own
size, with the soot-bag at his back, he coiled up his nose,
and said, <Q REND="inline">"What a poor dirty little creature it is!"</Q> His
Mother acted terror as before, and asked him, <Q REND="inline">"How he
came to be so wicked? and if he knew how it came to
pass, that HE was not that poor little sweep, and little
sweep Master Robert Berkeley."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"No."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Should you have liked it?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Do you think
if God Almighty had asked that little boy, whether he
would be Dr. Berkeley's son, or the sweep's, that he
would not have chosen to have been born a gentleman?
that Christ died to redeem from hell that little boy as
well as himself, or one of the King's little sons? that, as
<PB N="clxxv" REF="185"/>
he had not even the merit of choosing to come to Dr.
Berkeley's instead of to old La-Looe, (the nick name of
a chimney sweeper, who ought now to enjoy a very good
fortune in Bucks, if he had money to contend for it,) he
ought to to be humble as a little dove, instead of being
proud as Lucifer, and despising those whom Providence,
without <HI>any</HI> goodness of his, had placed below him."</Q>
He wept, and said, <Q REND="inline">"It was very wicked indeed; but, if
God would pardon it, he would never despise dirty chil∣dren
again."</Q> The worthy woman who brought him up,
was remarkably cleanly, and had made him so. He was
exceedingly careful to keep his word; for if he were told
of any thing that would offend God, no persuasion of the
most eloquent could cause him to do it. Such admono∣tions,
until he grew towards manhood, were heard by his
lovely brother, as they are by most other children, to use
a cant phrase, <Q REND="inline">"go in at one ear, and out at the other."</Q></P>
<P>The early ripe for glory are generally soon removed from
this vale of tears. To use the beautiful language of Dean
Hickes's Reformed Devotions:

<L>"If it still go on growing better.</L>

Mr. Berkeley and his brother were, whilst children, always
made, not to touch, but take off their hats to the poorest
labourer in the village who saluted them; if ever they
saw an old man or woman with a burden of wood, or leazed
corn, to run to open the gate to let them through. They
were made to treat the servants with the utmost civility,
never daring to <HI>order</HI> them to do any thing, being always
told, that they were not their servants, but their Father's:
therefore they must always say, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, John (or Thomas),
get me so or so."</Q> By incessant attention, and the utmost
vigilance, their pride was kept under, and, in due time,
by God's grace, eradicated.</P>
<P>It was no small delight to his Mother, on his arrival in
England, at the age of near twenty-two, that she could
scarcely go into any small shop in Canterbury without hear∣ing,
from the master or mistress, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! Madam, what a
fine young gentleman Mr. Berkeley is; so condescending!
he met my poor son, stopped, and asked him, how he
did? and hoped he went on well in the world. Who
would have thought he would have done him the honour
to remember him so many years?"</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remarked here, that Ecclesiastical Bodies do
<HI>some</HI> good. At Canterbury, the Dean and Prebendaries pay
for the education of fifty tradesmen's sons, find them books,
&amp;c. until they are eighteen or nineteen; and then, if they
<PB N="clxxvii" REF="189"/>
wish it, raise a subscription to send them to one of the
Universities. Many other cathedrals have similar charitable
institutions. This produces a sort of honourable equality,
as it enables the sons of chairmen, footmen, &amp;c. when
ordained, to associate with their superiors in birth, perhaps
not in learning.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's amiability was the more remarked, as he
quitted the King's School at the age of twelve, and his
Father removed his family to his living in West Kent the
year following, and returned not to settle in Canterbury
until the end of the year 1784; when it became his turn
to take the offices. A good old shopman one day said to
Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Madam, what a charming man Mr.
Berkeley is. He was <HI>galloping</HI> towards Margate, looking
like a <HI>young Lord,</HI> when one of our poor old neighbours
was creeping along. He suddenly stopped his horse,
drew up to the causeway, and asked him who he was,
and if he was comfortable? He took out his purse, and,
not finding much silver, bade his servant lend him half
a crown; which he gave to the poor man, and told him
to call upon him if ever he wanted any thing:"</Q> adding,
his eyes filling with tears, <Q REND="inline">"Lord bless him! where will
you find another young gentleman, going galloping on his
pleasure, that will think so of the poor?"</Q> It proved to
be the famous old News-carrier, of whom the fine print
was sold some years ago in Canterbury.</P>
<P><PB N="clxxviii" REF="190"/>
The poor and distressed were ever the grand objects of
his tender care. When at St. Andrew's, one night, at the
play, the poor man who acted the king in the tragedy
fainted away; and it had nearly been a <HI>real</HI> tragedy, as he
had several small children. On enquiry, it was found
to be from inanition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The next day the Editor sent her faithful, affectionate, trusty, aged, Scotch servant, the excellent Betty Russel, to enquire particularly into the state of these heroes and heroines of the stage. The worthy woman soon re∣turned, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Well-a-day, Madam, I never saw such an <HI>unka</HI> sight in all my life; there was the poor <HI>crator,</HI> who is to be queen to night, the king's wife that fainted last night, with her head dressed all in flowers and ribbons, and a fine crown, and a child sucking at her breast quite empty, it had not a drop of milk in it—she had had nothing but water all day—oh! it was an <HI>unka</HI> sight to see her head so fine, her breast hanging like a wet leather glove."</Q> That uncommonly honest, worthy woman, Elizabeth Russel, met with most kind, charitable friends, on Dr. Berkeley's family leaving St. Andrew's, in the amiable, excellent, and by them highly respected, Dr. Adamson, senior Kirk Minister of St. Andrew's, and his worthy very charita∣ble lady. The Editor used to delight to send her a guinea, in a letter to Dr. Adamson, until twice <HI>some</HI> post-master stopped it.</NOTE>. Mr. Berkeley, on finding that to
be the case, posted off to his tutor, the very amiable (now
Reverend) Mr. James Bruce, beseeching him to go and
relieve him on his account. On Mrs. Berkeley's saying,
<Q REND="inline">"Why did not you go yourself, instead of routing out Mr.
Bruce?"</Q> He wisely replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, the wo∣man
was exceedingly beautiful; and my going might have
injured her fame, which, I hear, although an actress,
is unsullied. So now you know why I got Bruce to go."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clxxix" REF="191"/>
Mr. Berkeley had certainly no offensive pride discovera∣ble
to those who knew him most intimately; for, what is
usually termed Family Pride is surely improperly so called.
A man, that is descended from a King rather than from a
cobler, from a Hero rather than from a Huckster, may feel
grateful to his Maker. Mr. Berkeley's Father felt it, his
Grandfather felt it, and perhaps he felt it on becoming a
Bishop. Some friend said, <Q REND="inline">"Your Lordship must now give
purple liveries."</Q> To which the good Bishop replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir. My becoming a Bishop will not make me give
up what the domestics of my ancestors have worn for
centuries."</Q> Accordingly his episcopal livery was the yel∣low
green coat worne by the servants of his honourable re∣lations,
the Earl of Berkeley, Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
his Brothers, &amp;c. with royal, <HI>i.e.</HI> red purple waistcoats,
&amp;c. and the servants of his Sons he always made wear the
crimson waistcoat, &amp;c. that he might not give up his fa∣mily
livery. Dr. Berkeley's coach being to be new painted,
the coach-maker said, <Q REND="inline">"To be sure, Sir, you will have a
cypher instead of your coat of arms. It is all the fa∣shion."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"That may be, Sir; but, if you please, put
on my coat. It is an <HI>old one,</HI> to be sure. The cypher is
very well for Nabobs and Planters, to save them trouble."</Q>
It was a great diversion, when Mr. Berkeley was seventeen or
eighteen, to a lovely young lady, whose death Mr. Berkeley
lamented in a most beautiful elegy, printed, but never sold,
to wink on Mrs. Berkeley, and say, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, one day or other
<PB N="clxxx" REF="192"/>
Berkeley will marry a girl with an hundred thousand
pounds, and change his name to Hickenbottom."</Q> (Vide
Kit Smart.) He used to storm, and say, <Q REND="inline">"Harriet, hold
your tongue: I will not change my name for a million."</Q>
Mr. Addison says, <Q REND="inline">"Ancient family is a feather, but it is a
<HI>feather</HI> that no man possessed of ever disdained to stick in
his cap."</Q></P>
<P>When the vile treatise on Education, written by that
learned Atheist, the late Lord Kaimes, made its appearance,
it was immediately in every hand. When Mr. Berkeley
came to the part where Lord Kaimes speaks of the Eton
<HI>Montem,</HI> he stormed violently indeed; he felt <HI>l'esprit du corps</HI>
so violently as to amuse all his friends. He assured his
Father and the gentlemen of the agreeable society of Cook∣ham
above described, that, had they been educated at Eton,
they would feel equal indignation. His mother assured him,
that men of forty-seven were rarely as irritable as youths of
seventeen; to which Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Madam,
I can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it
by, and not read one line more."</Q> She, laughing, asked,
<Q REND="inline">"If Lord Kaimes had abused dear Mrs. Sheeles's school?"</Q>
He replied, <Q REND="inline">"Much worse than that: I assure you, my dear
Madam, with <HI>all your calmness,</HI> you will be ready to throw
it into the fire."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley requested to be in∣formed;
but her Son politely declined it, saying, <Q REND="inline">"No;
read on, my dear Madam."</Q> It is certain, that when she
<PB N="clxxxi" REF="193"/>
came to the page where Lord Kaimes says, <Q REND="inline">"I would
advise you to be of the Christian religion, because it
is (or it happens to be) the religion of the country
where you were born,"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley verified her Son's
prediction, for she never thought it worth while to go on
with such a wretch on Education. His Lordship's Treatise
on Husbandry is an excellent work.</P>
<P>The following anecdote of that dreadful Atheist may be
depended on as a fact. It was related to the Editor by a
lady incapable of forging it, to whom it was related by an
eye and ear witness of the scene. When a divorce has
actually taken place, it is no scandal to speak of the di∣vorced
female as having lost her character. Lord Kaimes's
daughter was married to Mr. Heron, a gentleman of
very large fortune in Scotland, of most excellent cha∣racter,
and uncommonly amiable gentle manners, say all
who have the happiness of his acquaintance. The Editor
was well acquainted with the elegant worthy Major Heron,
his younger brother, when that favourite regiment, of
Canterbury families of fashion, the Scotch Greys, were
quartered at Canterbury. This lady was at length detected,
and gently and quietly sent home to her WORTHY father,
with a letter from her excellent injured husband, stating her
conduct. She reached her father's house in the afternoon.
In the evening, after tea, Lord Kaimes walked up and
down the room in silence, but appeared greatly agitated.
<PB N="clxxxii" REF="194"/>
At length he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child! how could
you act thus? How could you bring me to such shameful
disgrace?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my Lord, you have always told me,
that there was no other world; that the idea of an here∣after
was all a JUGGLE of knaves and priests to keep fools
in order; and, as I am not to be called to any account,
but by the world—I preferred Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to my hus∣band."</Q>
This silenced his Lordship: he said not a single
word more, and soon quitted the room. Mr. Heron, her
much injured husband, has, for many years, enjoyed great
felicity with a lady very differently educated from the
daughter of Lord Kaimes. May he long enjoy it!</P>
<P>In a few days after reading the book above mentioned,
when the social meeting happened to be at Dr. Berkeley's,
just before tea, the very learned Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> either took
off the slab behind him, or out of his pocket a newspaper
(neither that amiable gentleman nor the Editor can recol∣lect
which; if it was Dr. Berkeley's paper, it was the St.
James's Chronicle, as he was always partial to that paper,
on account of his old fellow collegian, Mr. Colman), and
began reading a letter to Lord Kaimes, concerning his very
severe attack on Eton School, proving to the learned Lord,
that he was totally ignorant of what he had been so grosly
abusing. Every one admired it exceedingly. Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> said,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Berkeley, this letter must delight you prodi∣giously,
surely. Eton is nobly vindicated indeed. The
<PB N="clxxxiii" REF="195"/>
Writer is quite of your spirit."</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied,
<Q REND="inline">"To be sure, every man educated there must be indignant
to find himself and his friends styled <HI>Highwaymen!</HI>"</Q> Mr.
M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> proceeded to read on, and said, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I believe, Berkeley must have written
this letter himself."</Q> To which Mrs. Berkeley replied,
<Q REND="inline">"HE write such a letter, poor dear soul! poor as I am, I
would give a thousand pounds that he could, three years
hence, write such a letter as that."</Q> To which Dr. Berke∣ley
added, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, poor fellow, I hope, if he is not idle,
he may, <HI>in time,</HI> write as well as this Eton champion."</Q></P>
<P>About seven years afterwards Mr. Berkeley, sitting con∣versing
with his Mother in her dressing-room, said, <Q REND="inline">"My
dear Mother, do you remember, before we went to
Scotland, a letter that M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> redde us out of the
newspaper, exposing Lord Kaimes's attack upon Eton
School?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, very well.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Do you remember his saying jocularly to you,
that he believed that it was written by me?</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"And do you remember what answer you made?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="clxxxiv" REF="196"/>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, that I would freely give a thousand
pounds that you were capable of writing that letter.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear Madam, perhaps it may now
give you some little pleasure to hear that your <HI>Bairn</HI> did
write that letter, and that Lord Kaimes answered it, ac∣knowledging
that he had been in an error concerning the
Eton <HI>Montem;</HI> adding, that he must have been an hasty
writer to publish such a censure on an ancient custom
sanctioned by <HI>such</HI> a man as Lord Camden, educated there,
who always makes a point of attending, and being
ROBBED<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whilst this sheet was in the press the Montem at Eton was celebrated.—It was a fine, <HI>very</HI> fine sight, that the Editor could not now, alas! have witnessed. She was twice called upon by a throughly polite young gentleman—a most active zealous friend of the Captain, who, on his entering the room at ten o'clock, most elegantly apologized for having called before so early as eight.—This young gentleman's conduct encourages the Editor to persevere in her as∣sertion from seventeen years old, <Q REND="inline">"That the young men, youths, even the lads of Eton School, are the GENTLEMEN of the nation."</Q> Dr. Berkeley used frequently to tell his son, when admonishing him, as a youth, to be, like a gentleman, well-bred, <Q REND="inline">"Why, child, <HI>every nobleman</HI> is <HI>not</HI> a <HI>gentleman.</HI>"</Q> To use the elegant language of the late Dr. Berkeley in a Charity-sermon—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>few</HI> can give the rich man's largesse, ALL may give the "<HI>widow's mite.</HI>"</Q> The very polite receiver of the Editor's mite, on her enquiry, she learned, was Mr. Marsh, of Lee in Kent. If he has parents, she congratulates them on having <HI>such</HI> a son. May he be spared to them! May they never suffer as the Editor has done! and must, in some few sad moments, ever do, until she meets her angelic-hearted son in the realms of bliss.</NOTE>, as Lord Kaimes terms it, of ten guineas; and
of late years his Majesty and the Queen. How any
<PB N="clxxxv" REF="197"/>
man of any country could suppose, that the sons, of men
of the highest rank, and most antient families in England,
would be permitted to act as he describes, is marvel∣lous."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, from the time he went to Eton, used very
acutely to learn his Mother's opinion of any little thing he
was going to publish in a Newspaper or Magazine, without
her even suspecting him as the author, by saying, <Q REND="inline">"It was
written by an Eton boy of his acquaintance;"</Q> lest, as he
told her when he grew up, maternal partiality might tempt
her to think it clever when it was not so; or the same ten∣derness
might tempt her to wish it suppressed, lest it should
expose him to ridicule.</P>
<P>On Mr. Berkeley's <HI>printing</HI> his "Maria, or The Gene∣rous
Rustic," written when he was only seventeen, the
copies were sent down to him. One day after dinner, he
went to his study, and brought a copy of it in sheets, say∣ing.
<Q REND="inline">"He would read something that he hoped might
amuse his Father and the ladies."</Q> He began; and Dr.
Berkeley, who had eyes like a lynx, seeing it in sheets, im∣mediately
exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heavens, child! what have
you done? This is written by you. Surely, you have
not gone and published some nonsense that will ruin your
character as a writer before you are a man."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why, <HI>I</HI>
have never published any thing with my name yet."</Q>
<PB N="clxxxvi" REF="198"/>
Mrs. Berkeley, <HI>mother-like,</HI> in agony to think that her
idol had injured his fame as a writer, began lamenting his
temerity. When the indignation of Dr. Berkeley and the
lamentations of Mrs. Berkeley were a <HI>little</HI> subsided, be∣cause
they were almost out of breath, he said, in the
sweetest voice and gentlest manner, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I am <HI>very</HI> sorry
you are all so angry with me. I have done what I could
to <HI>please</HI> you all. I have made the Marquis <HI>learned,</HI> to
please my Father; and I have made Maria <HI>pious,</HI> to gratify
my Mother."</Q> Mrs. Frinsham here interposed in her
<HI>wonted way,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"My dear, <HI>I</HI> think it very beautiful; and I
question whether <HI>either</HI> of <HI>them</HI> could have written such
a book at your age. I am sure I could not. Indeed I
am not QUITE sure I could do it now, that I am more
than double your age."</Q> Mrs. Frinsham has a wonderful
fund of true humour, which breaks forth on every occasion,
before the <HI>very few</HI> with whom she will be intimately ac∣quainted,
being perhaps the most reserved of human beings
now that Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> is dead; an excellent understand∣ing,
very highly cultivated by reading the best authors in
<HI>various</HI> languages; and, to sum up the character in few
words, as it is frequently done by the grateful Editor, per∣haps
the best woman on earth now that her excellent Mo∣ther
is removed to heaven.</P>
<P>Matters being a little quieted by Mrs. Frinsham's inter∣position,
Mr. Berkeley said to his Father, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, al∣though
<PB N="clxxxvii" REF="199"/>
it is <HI>printed,</HI> I would not presume to <HI>publish</HI> it
without your permission; and, if you disapprove it, I
will burn every copy but one. Indeed I have burnt a
vast deal many months ago, before I printed it. All the
Marquis's <HI>séjour</HI> in England and Wales, his remarks
on English manners, customs, &amp;c. I have destroyed.
Indeed I have burnt near five times as much as I have
printed; and, if you wish it, I will burn that."</Q> Here
there was a triple cry of, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! no."</Q> But Dr. Berkeley
asked, <Q REND="inline">"My poor simple child, why would you not let me
look it over and correct it?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Alas, my dear Sir, I
knew what would be its fate. You would have made a
new book."</Q> A very just remark. Dr. Berkeley never
could correct. He could write admirably, as the world
has seen; but any thing sent him to correct he always
re-made, generally perhaps for the better—but then, as his
Son, through life, used to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, the book is
yours, not the man's whose name it bears."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"But, if
you KNEW that, why not let your Mother read and cor∣rect
it?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Sir, for fear of getting my
Mother into a scrape, for not shewing it to you."</Q></P>
<P>Uncorrected as it was, it has been so admired, that, se∣ven
years ago, half a guinea was paid for a miserable,
thumbed, dirty copy, only to be found in those banes of
industry, cleanliness, &amp;c. &amp;c. a little country-town circu∣lating
library. Mr. Berkeley was often pressed to permit a
<PB N="clxxxviii" REF="200"/>
second edition; but his constant reply was, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>No; never
whilst my name is Berkeley.</HI> I was a <HI>great</HI> fool ever to
let there be one; but I was young, and, of course,
foolish."</Q></P>
<P>That there are great beauties in Maria is generally al∣lowed;
and that it has some considerable errors is certain.
The calling the idea of a Marquis, even a French Marquis,
marrying a little farmer's daughter, however worthy, being
highly objectionable, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>one of the absurd maxims of the world,</HI>"</Q> is
what, at twenty, or before, Mr. Berkeley would have ex∣punged.
And on his Mother's pointing out to him how
much better it would have been to have made her the
daughter of a reduced officer, he saw the force of it;
but replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You</HI> know, my dear Madam, that by means
of the nunneries in Popish countries every peasant's
daughter, living in the neighbourhood of a monastery,
can, on very easy terms, have as good an education as a
Duke's can."</Q> The styling the wretched consort of the
Baron D'Arandar his Wife instead of his Lady, was impro∣per;
and on his Mother's expressing her astonishment, that
he, who from infancy was well-bred and elegant, could be
guilty of such a vulgarism, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (a
gentleman then very intimate with Dr. Berkeley), always
ridiculed those who said Lord and Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, or Mr.
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and his Lady."</Q> This gentleman, long before
it became fashionable, was a great advocate for Equality.
<PB N="clxxxix" REF="201"/>
Mrs. Berkeley regretted the melancholy catastrophe of the
amiable Marquis and the noble-souled Maria.</P>
<P>After Mr. Berkeley's return to England, he came one
day to his Mother, and, enquiring if she had a couple of
hours to spare, sat down, and began to read, in manuscript,
"The Spanish Memoirs," telling her, as they appeared on
the stage, who the chief actors were; for Mr. Berkeley, in
every novel or poem, celebrated or stigmatized some real
existing character: thus, the hero of "Love and Nature,"
bears the title of Westmorland; Mr. Berkeley having al∣ways
respected the character of the present Earl of West∣morland,
for his spirited wise conduct in quitting a great
School, where he <HI>then</HI> could not learn any thing, for one
where he could, and did, learn very much, and for other
parts of his character. The late Earl of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, whose
pride, whose cruelty to very near relations, Mr. Berkeley
from a youth detested, is held up to contempt, to hatred,
in the person of the Duke D'Aranda, as he told his Mo∣ther.
When he had concluded, he desired to hear his
Mother's sentiments of the work. She told him, she liked it
very well, untill she came to the murder of Don Frederic
<Q REND="inline">"Murder!"</Q> he exclaimed. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, you have
not been listening with your usual attention to reading.
Why, he is not murdered. He is cast away, and
drowned."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cxc" REF="202"/>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, and what is that but mur∣dering
him, as you did the poor Marquis de Clerville and
Maria? Indeed, worse; for you leave this poor heroine
alive to mourn to the end of the chapter. How can YOU
practise such cruelties?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear Madam, I am glad you do not
disapprove any part but that <HI>innocent murder:</HI> I shall do
myself the honour to send you a copy as soon as it is
printed."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"And I shall certainly do <HI>myself</HI> the <HI>honour</HI>
to tuck it in between the bars of that grate, and <HI>burn it.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Burn it, my dear Madam! No, no. I am
sure you will not serve me so."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, I solemnly protest I will, without read∣ing
<HI>one</HI> line of it. You know I hate the idea of encou∣raging
melancholy on the mind. I have often told you,
that, with Mr. Addison, in one of his beautiful hymns in
the Spectator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All the Hymns, &amp;c. in the Spectator, (as has been already noticed, p. clxix.), were many years ago set to music by the late Mr. Sheeles, and dedi∣cated to Lady Albinia and Lady Mary Bertie, daughters of the late Duke of Ancaster, both educated at Mrs. Sheeles's school. Lady Mary had a pleasanter honour than being a Duke's daughter, being mother to Bertie Greathead, Esq.</NOTE>, I have always delighted that <HI>I</HI> could sub∣scribe
to that lovely line:<Q><L>"Nor is the least a chearful heart,</L>
<L>"Which tastes those gifts with joy."</L></Q></Q></P>
<P><PB N="cxci" REF="203"/>
The next day Mr. Berkeley and his Mother dining alone,
after the cloth was removed, he drew out the book, and
said, <Q REND="inline">"He had brought the conclusion of the Spanish Me∣moirs
to read to her."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"She would
not hear another tittle of them."</Q> He conjured her. She
rose to go. He said, <Q REND="inline">"You will catch your death. The
fire, I am sure, does not burn well in the drawing-room."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley, being resolute, got to the door. He pur∣sued,
and, taking hold of her gown, said, <Q REND="inline">"Well; suppose
Don Frederic is not dead, will you stay and hear?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Aye, but he is dead, and I will go."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Will you stay, if I solemnly declare he is
alive?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, because I know you will not deceive
me."</Q></P>
<P>Those who have redde the Spanish Memoirs know how
beautifully he is <HI>redivivus.</HI> Mr. Berkeley added, <Q REND="inline">"You
have made me spoil it; but I cannot bear to do any
thing that <HI>you</HI> do not approve."</Q></P>
<P>It has been mentioned above, that Mr. Berkeley was in∣debted
to Nature, or rather to the God of Nature, for a
most lovely disposition. A very shocking proof that a <HI>na∣ture</HI>
perhaps equally amiable (although not blessed with as
<PB N="cxcii" REF="204"/>
strong an understanding) may, by a bad education, dege∣nerate
into horrid cruelty of the meanest kind, is now
daily seen in the Honourable <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. It was a
common remark of Bishop Berkeley, that the strongest wine,
if ill kept, became the sourest vinegar.</P>
<P>The Editor was asked within a few months, if she was
not acquainted with <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; to which replying
in the affirmative, the gentleman answered, <Q REND="inline">"Then you
know the <HI>meanest</HI> scoundrel upon earth; for he is now
actually employed as a CRIMP."</Q> She lamented that a
creature <HI>so</HI> lovely in very early youth should, by bad educa∣tion,
have become so horridly, so shamefully depraved.
One or two instances of the sweetness, the delicacy of his
mind, when a child, shall be related.</P>
<P>A very honest old woman, who had lived many years at
Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s, his father's, and had the care of him from
his birth, dressed quite in the old style of <HI>wise</HI> servants fifty
years ago; therefore looked a little old-fashioned, about
thirty years ago. Lady W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, who visited his mother
often, used to laugh at this little man about the cut of
nurse's cap, &amp;c. Children should never be teazed; it in∣jures,
never corrects their tempers. It is not meant to do
it: it only serves to shew the low wit of old simpletons.
This hurt his then amiable heart so much, that when, as
children usually are, she conveyed her charge to the eating∣room
<PB N="cxciii" REF="205"/>
whilst she dined, he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"My dear nurse,
when you have opened the door, slip behind it, for fear
that ill-natured woman, Lady W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, should see you,
and laugh at you, and make me cry."</Q></P>
<P>One day, when he was barely eight years old, Dr.
Berkeley happening to be visiting at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s, Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,
as ignorant ladies are apt to do, began railing against the
university of Oxford. The next time Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> saw the
Editor, she said, <Q REND="inline">"I must tell you a remark of your little
favourite <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. Your coach was hardly driven from
the door, when he came and said, 'Surely, my dear
Mamma, when you abused Oxford so violently, you had
quite forgot that Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Berkeley had been
educated there a great many years, and must know it
well."</Q> Dr. Berkeley was then about twenty-six years
old, and had not long quitted that excellent university;
where, to be sure, young fools, if not <HI>properly</HI> placed, may
fall into mischief, as in the army, the navy, and the mer∣chant's

<P>Dr. Berkeley used every possible argument that a man of
his sense could devise, to persuade Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to send
Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to Dr. Glasse at Harrow, underr whose care, a
few years before, he being consulted by the two Dowager
Countesses, had been placed the late (not the last) Earl of
Barrymore, and the present Earl of Massareen, and his
<PB N="cxciv" REF="206"/>
brothers, the Honourable Messrs. Skeffington. Dr. Berke∣ley
was desired by the ladies to fix the salary. The two
peers paid each four hundred pounds a year; they had
horses kept for them: the others paid one hundred. But
Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, after deliberating some time, declared she
<HI>dreaded</HI> her son's being made <HI>too</HI> religious if he went to Dr.
Glasse. She lived to feel, <HI>bitterly</HI> feel, the direful want of
religion in two of her sons. The eldest, immediately on
his father's death, turning her out of the house in town,
and the crimp merchant out of the villa near town; and
had not the very worthy Countess of H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d, then go∣ing
out of town to make a visit in the North, kindly lent
hers, she must have taken a lodging. Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was
the most indulgent mother in the world; she attended to
her children's food, their physic, their warm cloathing, &amp;c.
but she left the care of their souls to—SATAN, and HE was
not wanting in his attentions. One of them had naturally
a good understanding; but neither Lord nor Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> were
equal to the task of directing it aright, nor by any
means equal to the still much harder task of cultivating and
directing weak Minds. Poor Lady!—she lived to <HI>feel</HI> the
threat of the Wise King <HI>sorely</HI> verified: <Q REND="inline">"A child left to
himself bringeth his MOTHER to shame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proverbs xix. chap. 20.</NOTE>;"</Q> which seems
to imply, that in those <HI>ignorant, unenlightened</HI> times the
<PB N="cxcv" REF="207"/>
care of sons devolved entirely, in the early part of life, on
the MOTHER. The very sensible Lord Halifax, in his Ad∣vice
to a Daughter, speaks excellently on this subject.
This book must become very scarce, since a very learned
gentleman, about a year ago, assured the Editor he had
never even <HI>heard</HI> of such a book. It is pity that more fa∣thers
do not put it early into the hands of their daughters.
It might contribute greatly in preventing husbands being
obliged to exhibit many unhappy creatures at Doctors
Commons and the House of Lords. Between the Wise
King and the Wise Peer, if both were duly studied, young
gentlemen and young ladies might certainly be very dif∣ferent
beings from what many in the present time are.</P>
<P>Solomon, when he says, <Q REND="inline">"Train up a child in the way
he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from
it,"</Q> does by no means imply, that he shall not, through
life, depart from it; he departed lamentably from it him∣self;
but having, as we well know, received an excellent
education from his pious preceptor, Nathan the prophet,
he returned into the paths of virtue and piety before his
death. The late Archdeacon of Berkshire, the very learned
Dr. Dodwell, in an excellent sermon on <Q REND="inline">"One man in a
thousand have I found,"</Q> &amp;c. told his audience, that pro∣bably
that great King owed the salvation of his soul to the
admonitions of his beloved friend, the son of Nathan, who
certainly, in those times, when Monarchs were absolutely
<PB N="cxcvi" REF="208"/>
arbitrary, <Q REND="inline">"put his life in his hand, to save the soul of his
sovereign, by admonishing him to return to the paths of
piety."</Q></P>
<P>It was an high act of friendship in the late excellent
S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>z, one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to a
King who reigned over these realms not <HI>quite</HI> a century
ago, to admonish his master frequently of the heinous sin
of adultery. To do the British Prince justice, although he
did not like the Jewish Prince reform, he never resented the
liberty taken. The nick-name of this gentleman, before
that of Methodist had, like Aaron's rod, swallowed up all
others, was, Praying S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>z. He <HI>prayed</HI> on earth; he
is now <HI>praising</HI> in heaven.</P>
<P>So terrifying is the idea of being styled a Methodist be∣come
of late, that within these few weeks the Editor (who
never was in a Methodist meeting but once in her life,
about twenty-five years ago, with a large party at Canterbury,
to hear some dull abuse from that accomplished old hypocrite,
John Wesley) advising a young gentleman to read a small
portion of the Bible every day to his servants, replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam, I should be reckoned a Methodist
if it was known that I did it, and that would be <HI>sad</HI> you
know."</Q> How wretched must those be who stand thus in
awe of mortal man! How happy are they who fear nought
<PB N="cxcvii" REF="209"/>
but God! That fear in due time will lead to <Q REND="inline">"perfect love,
which,"</Q> as St. John says, <Q REND="inline">"casteth out fear; for fear hath
torment."</Q></P>
<P>To attempt to do justice to Mr. Monck Berkeley's grati∣tude
to many noble relations, friends, and connexions,
from his first entrance into what is called <HI>life,</HI> would re∣quire
abilities far superior to those of an almost dying fe∣male,
by whom he had been taught from infancy, that he
had no <HI>right</HI> to expect any thing but what is usual, the
common decent civilities of life, from any but his Parents;
that every thing beyond that was to be repaid by gratitude,
as more than his due.</P>
<P>His gratitude to the eminently learned Professor Hunter
of St. Andrew's, in offering Dr. Berkeley to become him∣self
Mr. Berkeley's tutor, if Dr. Berkeley did not entirely
approve of Mr. Bruce, an <HI>eleve</HI> of Mr. Hunter, was through
life gratefully remembered by him; but Dr. Berkeley found
the Professor's character of Mr. Bruce to be perfectly just.
Dr. Berkeley accordingly asked Mr. Bruce the value of his
<HI>whole</HI> time, desired him to dismiss all his other pupils, and
devote himself entirely to the care of Mr. Berkeley; which
he did for a considerable time, until the arrival of his dear
friend Mr. Grimston, who came on Mr. Berkeley's account,
and entered at St. Andrew's, and an old intimate Eton friend
of Mr. Berkeley's in the same form with him there. Being
all, as it is termed, reading the same books, they could
<PB N="cxcviii" REF="210"/>
not interfere; and Mr. Berkeley, amiably wishing to benefit
Mr. Bruce, whom he exceedingly loved, requested his Fa∣ther
to permit him to become tutor to those two gentle∣men
only, from both of whom he received a large salary,
which enabled him, a few years after, to enter at Emanuel
College, Cambridge, under the protection of Dr. Berkeley's
much loved and respected friend, the celebrated and worthy
Dr. Farmer.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude through life to those who in∣structed
him was uniform. He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"If <HI>I would
not</HI> learn, <HI>that</HI> was not <HI>their</HI> fault."</Q> He used always to
boast to his Father, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, <HI>idle</HI> as <HI>you</HI> may think me,
I can assert, with strictest truth, that I never have once
bowed at Professor Hill's, Hunter's, or indeed at any
Professor's lectures."</Q> An explanation being requested of
the word <HI>bowing,</HI> it was thus given: <Q REND="inline">"Why, if any poor
fellow has been a little idle, and is not prepared to speak
when called upon by the Professor, he gets up and makes
a respectful bow, and sits down again."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's friendship for his very learned tutor, the
Reverend Mr. Green, on whose sole account he was by his
Father sent to Magdalene Hall, rather than to his own be∣loved
Christ Church, was very great. Mr. Berkeley consi∣dered
him as the most active and vigilant of tutors, who
would <HI>force</HI> young men to learn, whether so disposed or
<PB N="cxcix" REF="211"/>
not, and the great care he took of their morals, devoting
almost the whole of his leisure time to the common room.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley was blest with a wonderful sagacity in
discerning characters, and often exhibiting them to the di∣version
of his friends, even when the persons whose cha∣racters
he drew were present. He used frequently to say
to his Father and Aunt, <Q REND="inline">"Now I will treat you with an
exhibition of my Mother last night at Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s
rout;"</Q> and then proceed, generally saying, <Q REND="inline">"Well! to
be sure <HI>my</HI> Mother is a woman by herself; for I believe
the Almighty never formed any thing before her, or ever
will any thing after her, like herself. The whole world
cannot make her say a thing she does not mean, make
her answer a question she does not choose to answer, nor
visit any body she does not choose to visit, unless once
or twice, where my Father has interposed his ROYAL AU∣THORITY;
then she reluctantly sets off."</Q> This latter
part arose from Mrs. Berkeley's resolution, through life,
never to visit any cook, house-maid, &amp;c. who had been
kind enough to live with a gentleman six or seven years be∣fore
she was sanctioned from Doctors Commons to step into
the coach and six, and sit at the head of the table, and
be caressed by all the <HI>amiable</HI> virtuous dames in the neigh∣bourhood.
Mrs. Berkeley is by no means one of those
styled by Mr. Addison <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the outrageously virtuous;</HI>"</Q> <HI>tout au
contraire</HI>—and her kindness in restoring more than one fallen
<PB N="cc" REF="212"/>
acquaintance, the wives of gentlemen, they gentlewomen,
mothers of large families of young children, is well known
to many who will read these sheets through curiosity. But
the case is widely different. Mary or Nan, if tolerably
cunning wenches, reason thus: <Q REND="inline">"It is hit or miss. If I
live with the 'Squire seven years—if I can draw him in
to marry me, why, I am a <HI>fine Laady</HI> for life; and if I
can't, why I shall do just as well for <HI>Bob the Postillion.</HI>"</Q>
Agreed: but you ought not to be company for ladies of
virtue, birth, and education; nor are ye, or ever shall be,
for one insignificant individual, who more than once,
insignificant as she is, has mortified titled harlots of this de∣scription.
One indeed sent to know what she had done,
that Mrs. Berkeley would not visit her; and Mrs. Berkeley
bade the lady tell her. Whether the lady did tell her or
not must be guessed. The wife of a gentleman may be∣have
very foolishly, very idly; and it may, it must, be
very difficult to ascertain whether her conduct is criminal
or not; and if her husband (not a known scoundrel) does
not give her up, her friends and neighbours ought not to
do it. But with Mary and Nan and the 'Squire, there can∣not
remain a doubt, especially when a poor little base-born
brat appears, and is owned every year. It is the <HI>bounden</HI>
duty of <HI>every sincere</HI> servant of GOD to discountenance vice;
let it be seriously remembered, that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> himself says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Who
will rise up with me against the wicked, and take my part
against the evil-doers?</HI>"</Q> Every individual, however hum∣ble
<PB N="cci" REF="213"/>
their station in life, may enjoy that honour by brow∣beating
vice, as the worthy Dr. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>b<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y, of M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,

<P>In a country where the QUESTION, as the torture used
to be termed in France, <HI>i.e.</HI> the rack, is not allowed; Mrs.
Berkeley did not think <HI>very</HI> highly of <HI>her own mental</HI> powers
in resolving not to answer any <HI>home-thrust,</HI> as she termed it,
however it might excite the admiration of her clever Son,
and sensible excellent friend, Mrs. Duncombe, the cultivated,
the enlightened relict of the late very learned, amiable,
Reverend John Duncombe, M.A. well known in the
learned world, and of whom the great Mr. Burke once said,
speaking of him, to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"He was a very considera∣ble
man indeed."</Q> This lady, with whom the Editor
esteems it one of her greatest earthly felicities that she has
lived in the strictest, the most uninterrupted friendship for
the last twenty-five years of her life, that is, ever since the
commencement of their acquaintance, and to whom she feels
herself deeply indebted for a thousand amiable attentions,
particularly during her last melancholy visit to Canterbury—any
attempt by so feeble a pen to celebrate the <HI>elêve</HI> of
Mr. Richardson, the friend of Mrs. Epictetus Carter, the
relict of the abovenamed learned, well-informed Mr. Dun∣combe,
would be a vain effort, unless it were to sing <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a
hymn to my own praise and glory,</HI>"</Q> for having been ho∣noured
<PB N="ccii" REF="214"/>
with the friendship of such a woman. Mrs. Dun∣combe's
own fine pen <HI>has, does</HI> celebrate her fame, her
praise; long may she live to use it, for the entertainment,
the improvement, of those who read what is worth reading.
Her letters, carefully preserved, if printed, would give the
English a <HI>Madame Sevignée</HI> of their own nation. It is to be
hoped, that some time or other they may be collected and
given to the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is certain that they would <HI>not</HI> cost the pains that those of the lovely, lively, and, in her latter days, excellently pious, Madame de Sevignée's did; for one has frequently heard, that it took many months to a <HI>patient</HI> genius, to correct the false orthography of those very entertaining, improving letters. Madame de Sevignée had never studied "The complete Letter Writer," pub∣lished some years ago. Of the minor visitations there are few things more dreaded by Mrs. Duncombe and the Editor, than an epistle from any lady who has. Last time they met, Mrs. Duncombe redde such an epistle to the Editor, who said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, I am grown very stupid, I do not understand it."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>No, how should you without the book?</HI>"</Q> The Editor's Father always told his girls, letters should be conversation upon paper. A most charming corre∣spondent of the Editor's, long since removed to bliss, once shewed her a letter from a lovely young friend of her's—after a page of chit-chat, she writes thus: <Q REND="inline">"Oh! aye, but I forgot to tell you that I was married about a fortnight ago, that is true;"</Q> and then proceeds as before. The Editor greatly prefers Miss P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ge's letter, as above quoted, to the studied epistles of <HI>letter-book</HI> ladies.</NOTE>, although in them would be found some
very <HI>smart</HI> strictures on the Writer of these pages. This
lady, like Mr. Monck Berkeley, has often said that the Editor
had an art <HI>superior</HI> to <HI>magic,</HI> in not being made to speak
when she had not a mind to speak. Mrs. Duncombe
<HI>can,</HI> and Mr. Monck Berkeley <HI>could,</HI> alas! entertain very
highly by speaking—the Editor, it should seem, by her
silence.</P>
<P><PB N="cciii" REF="215"/>
Mr. Berkeley, having been out of England for several
months, on his return, as usual, immediately paid his duty
at home. After dinner, as he sat chatting with his Mother,
she said, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley! your old friend, <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,
is married, since you left us, to Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s niece, a
very sweet, pleasing, young lady. But I am sure you
won't believe me, when I tell you, that it is a certain
fact (no <HI>flam</HI> or <HI>fun</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley had the pleasure of living in great intimacy with the family of the late Lord and the present very worthy, throughly amiable, Dowager Lady Dacre.

child through the whole of the ceremony."</Q> Never, whilst
the Editor retains her reason, can she forget the reception
this speech met from Mr. Berkeley. He lifted up his
beautiful eyes, and, with the solemnity of a pious judge
when he pronounces the sentence of death, said, <Q REND="inline">"Weep,
my dear Mother! Well might he weep, poor fellow! I
shall wonder if he ever does any thing but weep through
life."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why so?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why so? Why, because three years ago he
courted a gentleman's daughter to marry her, when the

with him; and when he had got the poor creature to <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> House,
he refused to marry her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gentleman being asked to subscribe to a book, Mr. Moore's Treatise on Suicide, Gaming, and Duelling, which Dr. Berkeley used to say he esteemed to be the first, the most useful work of this century, laughingly replied to the solicitor of the guinea, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! <HI>I</HI> am in no manner of danger of killing myself."</Q> That did not appear quite so certain to the person who asked the subscription. He is a young noble of very large paternal estate. Mr. Moore's two volumes are more entertaining than most novels, and as pious as most sermons. On the publication of the first volume, the Editor ventured to recommend them, in a letter in the St. James's Chronicle, proposing to have prints engraved for fire∣screens from some of the most <HI>tremendous tales of woe</HI> related by Mr. Moore. The Editor supposes it never reached Mr. Baldwin, as he generally finds a corner to insert any hint that she thinks may benefit her fellow-creatures. Dr. Berkeley made the Editor write to the very worthy Mr. Moore, to raise his in∣estimable volumes to three guineas, instead of to <HI>half</HI> that sum. Their worth, to those that <HI>well weigh</HI> them, is beyond all price surely.</NOTE>; and the

how often have I heard you applaud my grandfather's

<PB N="ccvi" REF="218"/>

<P>This excellent gentleman has, for near forty years, done
due honour to his, alas! for this poor nation, <HI>very uncom∣monly</HI>
pious education,—family prayers every day, with
the lessons and psalms of the day—and the Editor hears
with pleasure, that his exemplary care of his family is
repaid, by that God whose doctrine <Q REND="inline">"he so beautifully

<HI>they</HI> be spared to him! Long may <HI>he</HI> be spared a blessing
to them!</P>
<P>Few men, perhaps, have ever been formed with more
qualifications to make a complete orator than Mr. Berke∣ley;
a very uncommonly harmonious musical voice, with,
from an infant, the sweetest tones imaginable, which he
could at pleasure elevate, like his grandfather, Bishop
Berkeley, to <HI>tremendous</HI> thunder; taught, from four years old,
to repeat by heart, without rant or forced action, being
told, after he properly understood the meaning of what he
had learned, to repeat it as he felt it on his own mind;
and being, from seven years old, accustomed to talk with
delight of speaking in Westminster Hall; he took every op∣portunity
of improving himself.</P>
<P>When a boy at Canterbury School, which, as has been
already observed, he quitted at twelve years old, during
<PB N="ccvii" REF="219"/>
the sessions for the city at the Guild-Hall, and for the
county at the old Castle, Mr. Berkeley generally went
without his dinner, flying off the instant the school broke
up to the court, to hear the pleadings. He once prevailed
on his Father to permit him to go, attended by Mr.
Wrightson, under a strict promise <Q REND="inline">"<HI>of doing every thing that
John bade him,</HI>"</Q> to Maidstone, to attend at the assizes.
On his return home, he related all the causes and pleadings,
and a particular in the summing up the evidence by Sir
William Blackstone, as accurately as if he had taken it all
down in short-hand, which he could not then do. He
was, if the French expression <HI>fort éveillié</HI> may be per∣mitted
to be translated into English, the most <HI>awaked</HI> of all
creatures. <HI>Nothing</HI> escaped him; he caught every thing he
saw, and wished to know, in a moment. One instance
proves it very strongly. Soon after he went to Eton he
had a <HI>raging</HI> desire to learn to fence, which his Father was
<HI>resolved</HI> he should <HI>not</HI> do, until he attained to a certain age,
fixed by him. All Mr. Berkeley's arguments that the Bi∣shop
had let his Father learn at fourteen were ineffectual;
Dr. Berkeley saying, that many youths of fashion were
often killed by its straining their lungs when they were too
tender to bear it. Mr. Berkeley was, however, resolved
to learn what he could, as he afterwards told his Father,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"I had little trouble when <HI>I did</HI> learn; for I used,
instead of going to cricket, &amp;c. to go regularly at the
hours of learning, and fix myself like a statue at the
<PB N="ccviii" REF="220"/>
window."</Q> Whilst the very worthy, respectable, universally
respected Mr. Angelo was instructing his pupils, he used to
say, <Q REND="inline">"I think I hardly came <HI>honestly</HI> by my skill in fencing.
But Angelo is as worthy, amiable a man as ever lived;
and, I dare say, did not grudge me what I so gleaned
from his great skill."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley spoke his Prize Exercise in the Par∣liament
Hall at St. Andrews, before the then Chancellor
of that University, the late Earl of Kinnoul; when all
the prize exercises had been delivered, Lord Kinnoul went
to Mr. Berkeley, and, embracing him, said, <Q REND="inline">"I rejoice,
Sir, to embrace the grandson of my dear old friend, Bi∣shop
Berkeley, and to be able to say, that <HI>I</HI> never heard
speech <HI>so</HI> spoken from this pulpit since I have had the
honour to be Chancellor here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley had redde
his prize exercise near fifty times over to his Mother. Just
before he went out, he conjured her to hear him once
more, that he might lay his emphasis exactly right. The
request was complied with.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, together with his amiable, beloved friend,
the late, learned Sir John Ramsey, and his dear friend,
Mr. Lennard, frequently spent part of their vacation very
pleasantly at Lord Kinnoul's seat. A droll anecdote or two
might be here related, particularly a scene in the Library;
but this Preface is already too long, and the reader has,
<PB N="ccix" REF="221"/>
perhaps, frequently exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What is all this chit-chat
to <HI>me?</HI> I wish to read the great actions of great men."</Q>
If so, according to the advice of the <HI>great</HI> Johnson, and the
<HI>little</HI> Editor, read Sir Francis Knollys's History of the Turks,
Marcus Antoninus, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression. It is impossible to
omit an amiable attention of a young Scotch gentleman,
who, with his wonderfully sensible younger brother Tho∣mas,
constantly attended the service of the Church of
England at Dr. Berkeley's, and who were frequently invited
to visit there. The young Laird of Logie-Almon came
running into Mrs. Berkeley's dressing-room quite breath∣less;
he threw himself into a chair, and on Mrs. Berkeley's
enquiring if he was ill, and asking whether he would have
any thing, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Madam; no. But
I flew hither to tell you how delightfully Mr. Berkeley
has spoken; and in what <HI>extacies</HI> Lord Kinnoul (one of
the many guardians of this very pleasing, amiable, young
gentleman) said to me, I thought it <HI>must</HI> delight you;

Mr. Berkeley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has heard from others, never from her Son (although from him, by letter, she heard much of his <HI>expected</HI> tremors), that the first night of his speaking at Blenheim, even whilst his obliging neighbours, the Mayor, Corporation, and their families, were clapping him; which the dear amiable Bishop of Norwich wrote Dr. Berkeley word, the next post, they did for some minutes before they suffered him to speak; Mr. Berkeley dropt his hat, and was unable to take it up, so exceedingly did his hand tremble; and on the stage it must have remained, but that the very accomplished, amiable Lord Mount Edgecombe, happening to see Mr. Berkeley's distress, stepped on the stage, picked up the hat, and gave it to him.</NOTE>trembled violently, and was so long before

he <HI>began</HI> to speak, that I expected every moment, the
Chancellor would say, <HI>Pray, Sir, begin;</HI> and that would
have made him ten times worse. But when he had once
begun, he got courage, and went on nobly; and every
body is astonished."</Q> This young gentleman was at that
time barely fifteen years old. May he, as a man, through
life, be what he was in youth!</P>
<P>A very extraordinary circumstance happened at the birth
of this young gentleman. A very aged domestic of the
Drummond family, many years more than an hundred,
who lived in a little cot (by the bounty of the excellent
Laird) on Logie-Almon estate, as soon as he heard that his
dear Laird had a son, walked down about a mile to get a
sight of him. He was told the infant was asleep. He re∣turned
the next day. The Laird walked out; Lady Ca∣tharine
feared letting the child be carried out of the room.
He returned the day but one following: the Laird <HI>at home,</HI>
ordered the infant down, to be viewed by worthy old
Steel; who, taking him into his arms, said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.</HI> I thank thee for
having permitted me to see (the Editor thinks) the <HI>seventh</HI>
<PB N="ccxi" REF="223"/>
generation of my dear old first master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A somewhat similar circumstance occurred between two relations of the Editor. <Q REND="inline">"Old Tom Leigh of Iver, the <HI>honestest old Tory in England,</HI>"</Q> aged about ninety—on the birth of the late Colonel Powney, member for Windsor—ordered his coach, and went over to Iver Place, to congratulate his friend Powney. He rejected caudle, cake, &amp;c. and, to the no small amaze∣ment of Mr. Powney, said, <Q REND="inline">"Tell your butler to bring us a bottle of wine."</Q> The infant was desired to be brought down; when Mr. Leigh, filling out a glass of wine, took the infant's hand, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Little man, I have come hither on purpose to have the pleasure of drinking a <HI>bottle</HI> of wine with <HI>you,</HI> the fifth of your family with whom I have enjoyed that pleasure."</Q> The Powneys are a short-lived family; the Leighs, in general, very long-lived. The Editor's ancestor of that name lived to a great age.</NOTE>."</Q> The excellent
Laird, equally delighted, ordered him refreshment. He
walked gently home, sat down in his chair, saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Now I
am happy</HI>"</Q>—and his faithful affectionate spirit took its
flight without even a sigh.</P>
<P>Those medical gentlemen of skill, who heard the above
fact (much spoken of at the time) agreed, that had he
seen the young Laird on the first day when he went for
that purpose, the spirit of the good old man had been freed
three days sooner; that his ardent desire had detained it.
One has frequently heard of similar instances of the de∣tention
of the spirit in its earthly prison for hours, even
days. What a wonder is the spirit of man! How passing
wonder HE who implants it in the curiously wrought prison!
The late very sensible, unfortunate, Honourable Colonel
Nairne, a great collector, who had a fine print of old Steel,
<PB N="ccxii" REF="224"/>
which Mr. Monck Berkeley purchased, with many other cu∣riosities,
after his death, has frequently told the Editor, that
the engraver mistook in setting down his age, one hundred
and nine, that it ought to have been one hundred and
thirty-nine. One cannot help dropping a tear on the la∣mentable
fate of this very accomplished, well-informed man.
His father, Lord Nairne, unfortunately engaged in the Re∣bellion;
the son fighting for the Hanover family. The
first duty to which he was appointed, was to go and batter
down his own noble magnificent castle. His late Majesty,
who knew him personally, was very desirous to have given
him a regiment and other bounties; but the Duke of
Cumberland prevented it, by telling his Majesty it was
<HI>impossible</HI> a man who had suffered so much could ever forget
or forgive it. Thus the desperate, despairing, poor sinner,
thinks of an all-merciful Saviour; although he has repeat∣edly
declared, <Q REND="inline">"Him that cometh to me (<HI>i.e.</HI> during
the state of trial on earth) I will no wise cast out."</Q>—There
is no SAVING repentance <HI>after</HI> death—whilst we are
on earth, he is a Sovereign, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>mighty to us:</HI> The Lamb
of God, that taketh away the sins of the world."</Q> The
instant we quit the body, he becomes our Judge—the Lion
of the tribe of Judah. The Editor is not a disciple of the
acute <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; she has redde Horbury, and thinks with Dr.
Young,<Q><L>"Not so our Infidels—."</L>
<L>"—A GOD ALL Mercy—is a GOD unjust."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccxiii" REF="225"/>
Indeed, so anxious was Mr. Berkeley to improve himself
in public speaking, that, with the permission of Principal
M'Cormick, of whose polite attentions to himself and the
other English <HI>gentlemen</HI> students he always spoke in high
terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor seldom recollects to have seen Mr. Berkeley more angry than once in a large circle, when a gentleman said, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley, Dr. Gilbert Stuart has wonderfully attacked your Scotch Principal of St. Andrews,"</Q> and proceeded to repeat what Stuart had published. Mr. Berkeley reddened with indignation, and said, <Q REND="inline">"He is a rascal;—and, let him say what he <HI>will, I</HI> say, who lived near four years under his discipline, that his conduct towards us was remarkably gentleman-like and liberal; and, I am persuaded, there is not one Englishman that would not join me in declaring it; and Stuart is a rascal, I repeat it."</Q></NOTE>, he instituted a <HI>Literarii Viginti,</HI> who were to meet
and speak for two or three hours in the evening, either
once a week, or once a fortnight. The Principals, Profes∣sors,
gentlemen of the city and neighbourhood, frequently
honoured this little seminary of <HI>juvenile</HI> orators with their
presence. Two on each side were generally chosen to speak
and oppose; and every one, as in the House of Commons,
was permitted to rise and speak on either side. Those
appointed to speak on the subject always carried a speech
prepared on paper. Mr. Berkeley used always to say,
<Q REND="inline">"Hang that paper, I am so glad when I have done with
it. When I throw my notes aside, I can speak with <HI>spi∣rit.</HI>
I hate to be hampered. I love to be, as the French
say, <HI>coudes franches.</HI> I believe I shall <HI>do</HI> at the bar; for I
feel twice the strength after all my arguments are op∣posed
<PB N="ccxiv" REF="226"/>
and pulled to pieces, that I do at going on without
opposition; it <HI>animates,</HI> it <HI>inspires</HI> me."</Q></P>
<P>One morning, after a Viginti evening, Mrs. Berkeley,
walking out, was met by Professors Hill, Hunter, Baron, and
many others, who all congratulated her on the figure Mr.
Berkeley had made the preceding evening amongst the
young orators. It would be wasting ink to say how much
the heart of the Mother of an only child must have felt
this commendation.</P>
<P>A rather laughable circumstance occurred two or three
days afterwards. Mrs. Berkeley, taking her usual walk by
the sea, was met by a lady, who, after <HI>complimenting</HI> her
on Mr. Berkeley's fine speaking, added, <Q REND="inline">"and my son
spoke too, and did pretty well, I hear."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley,
who, as her Son always said of her, <Q REND="inline">"would not flatter
Royalty;"</Q> no, not her favourite <Q REND="inline">"Queen of Sheba, were
she now on earth;"</Q> said, <Q REND="inline">"she was glad to hear that sweet <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> had done so well."</Q> A most lovely excellent
young man he was; and Mrs. Berkeley used frequently to say
to him, as she used to say to the angelic Mr. Montgomerie
a dozen years before, <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, if I had a daughter with
an <HI>hundred thousand pounds</HI> in her pocket, and you had
<HI>only</HI> the coat on your back, <HI>such as you are,</HI> I would beg
the <HI>favour</HI> of you to marry her."</Q> Should any one read thus
<PB N="ccxv" REF="227"/>
far, perhaps long ago they have done it, they will probably
again exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"The creature is a FOOL! quite an IDIOT!"</Q>
But the Editor never conceived any happiness could arise
from setting two sacks of gold together, any more than
that bread will be produced by setting two sacks of wheat
side by side. But to return. This wise lady proceeded,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, Mrs. Berkeley; as both our sons have spoken, and
gained credit, let <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> make an agreement, that <HI>they</HI>
shall not speak any more, <HI>for fear</HI> they should lose the
credit they have gained."</Q> To which Mrs. Berkeley, ob∣serving
the <HI>extreme</HI> cleverness of the speaker, replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear Madam, you know you are <HI>sole</HI> directress of
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; but, thank God, my Son has a <HI>much
wiser</HI> director than his Mother. Dr. Berkeley is a most
excellent judge, and judicious director of young men's
education; and I have no more idea of interfering in
parts of my Son's education as a scholar, than I have of
sitting down to write a Visitation or Assize Sermon for his
Father; BUT I will <HI>certainly</HI> tell him what YOU, Madam,
say."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley <HI>failed not</HI> to do it; BUT Mr. Berkeley
went on speaking, without losing <HI>any</HI> of his credit as an orator.
Two of the Scotch speakers are now in England, the
learned, entertaining, Reverend Mr. James Bruce, Mr.
Berkeley's tutor, and the gentle, pleasing Mr. William
Kemp, tutor to Mr. Lennard, who was many years ago
recommended, through Dr. Berkeley's recommendation, by
his amiable friend, the late Lord Dacre, into the family of
<PB N="ccxvi" REF="228"/>
the Earl of Beverley, where his uncommon merits as a tutor
are felt, and most generously, most nobly rewarded, by
the noble descendant of the great hero of Chevy-Chace.</P>
<P>Soon after Mr. Berkeley's return to England he began to
feel an ardent desire to obtain a seat in Parliament. How
was that wish to be gratified? Bishop Berkeley was too
generous to amass a fortune. He constantly gave away
with both hands. After thirty thousand pounds debt paid
by Mr. Berkeley's grandmother, Mrs. Frinsham, and her
single sister, Mrs. Cherry, of their grandfather William
Cherry, Esquire, and <HI>establishing,</HI> instead of taking, (as or∣dered
by him if wanted to pay his debts,) a very good
estate left by him to found a charity school in the parish of
Bray in Berkshire, where lay a large part of his vast
estate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be a pleasantry to say, that the burning of Cliefden's "<HI>Proud Alcove</HI>" finished it; but, on that conflagration, the other day, went ten thou∣sand pounds more of old Mr. Cherry's fortune; he having lent the Duke of Buckingham, commonly, justly, called the wicked Duke of Buckingham, that sum to build that delightful mansion. Mr. Berkeley's Mother and Aunt have a note of hand of the Duke for seven thousand pounds. The Editor did not pro∣duce it as any part of her fortune when she married. The wonder was, that <HI>so very acute</HI> a man as old Mr. Cherry certainly was, <HI>should lend to such</HI> a man as the Duke of Buckingham, so large a sum, on only a common note of hand.—but Mr. Cherry was immensely rich, and lent to every one of his friends that asked him—accordingly his great-grand-daughter finds <HI>some</HI> of her kind friends much more ready to <HI>lend</HI> than <HI>she is to borrow</HI>—for which may GOD reward them here and hereafter.</NOTE>. The South-Sea bubble had, although not beggared,
<PB N="ccxvii" REF="229"/>
yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of Mr. Cher∣ry's
fortune; so that, during the life of Mr. Berkeley's Mo∣ther,
he could not get a qualification that would sit easy on
<HI>his</HI> conscience. His Mother, on learning this, offered to give
up <HI>entirely</HI> into his hands her whole settlement, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I
have, from your infancy, ever said, 'If <HI>I must be</HI> abso∣lutely
dependant on any fallen child of Adam, may it be
on Berkeley! not on dear sweet Robert; for Berkeley
has a generosity of soul that <HI>I</HI> have never seen in any
human being, through my whole life, but in himself
alone."</Q> On saying this he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Jesus avert that
I should be SUCH a villian. No; I would, were it ne∣cessary,
sooner carry a brown musket, than ever touch a
six-pence of your settlement. It is too small, we all know.
No; never whilst my name is Berkeley, will I ever di∣minish
it. It may, I hope, please God that I may live
to <HI>add</HI> to it."</Q></P>
<P>On his coming home at vacation-time, he often men∣tioned
curious causes at Westminster Hall and the Old Bai∣ley.
His Father one day said, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, it does not seem
to me that you go often to the House of Commons. I
should think that you would be there perpetually."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I never go at all."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Never go. How is that? I am sure you
know at least <HI>half</HI> an hundred members that would take
you in."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccxviii" REF="230"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my dear Sir, I know men enough that
would take me in <HI>every</HI> day if I would go; but I will <HI>not
go.</HI> I dare not trust myself."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Not trust yourself! what, do you think you
should spring up and speak?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Madam, no; but I am afraid the
Devil should tempt me to long <HI>so much</HI> to get into Par∣liament,
that I should deceive myself, and reason myself
into a belief that a <HI>sham</HI> qualification had no harm in it;
and therefore, the Lord being my helper, I never will
set foot in St. Stephen's Chapel, unless I can go thither
properly authorized to speak. So you will never hear
any account from <HI>me</HI> of the orators there."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley went perpetually to hear Hastings's Trial.
He told his Father, that <Q REND="inline">"after listening with all the atten∣tion
he was possessed of to the harangues of a certain
great Orator, he conceived that his grand argument was
a strong arm, which enabled him to <HI>thump</HI> the table vio∣lently<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Orator here described, has <HI>certainly</HI> many other arguments than <Q REND="inline">"<HI>thumping the table.</HI>"</Q>—But Mr. Berkeley was so convinced of Mr. Hastings's in∣nocence with regard to <HI>money</HI> matters, that he felt indignation at his nearest friends for not seeing it. The Editor, at one time, suffered a sort of persecution from her <HI>two</HI> sons (the excellent Mr. Grimston she always styled her <HI>second</HI> son), so as to occasion her threatening to bolt her dressing-room door—enter Mr. Berkeley with a thick pamphlet—<Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, I con∣jure you to read <HI>this,</HI> and you will be <HI>convinced</HI> that Hastings is an injured man."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"My dear Son, I have redde Mr. Hastings's <HI>own</HI> letter, where he says, 'Nothing can be done in this business until Mr. Fowke is removed;' Now <HI>you know,</HI> I have told you a score times, that 'if there is <HI>but one</HI> honest man upon earth, <HI>that man</HI> is my old friend Mr. Fowke, whom I have not seen these last thirty years; but men seldom turn rogues at <HI>fifty.</HI> You know the <HI>two</HI> instances of his <HI>stern</HI> integrity, that I have held up to your imitation since you were ten years old."</Q> Then enter Mr. Grimston, with two or three <HI>thick</HI> treatises on the INIQUITY of the Slave-trade—<Q REND="inline">"Come now, my dear Madam, I am sure you <HI>can,</HI> you <HI>will,</HI> find time to read <HI>these,</HI> and you will see <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"See what, my dear Grimston, you know that I am a great reader of a <HI>very old fashioned book;</HI> and I read <HI>there,</HI> in Leviticus, 'WHOSOEVER is found stealing a MAN, shall SURELY be put to death;' now I believing, with <HI>all</HI> my soul, <HI>that argument</HI> against the Slave-trade, what would you have more of me?"</Q> When they are stolen, would to God all would treat them as does my kindly respected friend John Ashley, Esquire, of Jamaica, none of whose slaves <HI>will accept</HI> their freedom when asked.</NOTE>."</Q> It must here be said, that Mr. Berkeley was a
<PB N="ccxix" REF="231"/>
strenuous assertor of Mr. Hastings's innocence. He had
put himself to considerable expence to procure documents
from India, and had prepared for the press, perhaps as ela∣borate
an investigation of Mr. Hastings's conduct and cha∣racter,
as beautiful a defence as was ever penned, which
he, however, the day before it was to be sent to the press,
sacrificed to paternal authority. He brought it to the Edi∣tor,
and, with tears in his eyes, threw it on her table, say∣ing,
<Q REND="inline">"There is a <HI>sacrifice to duty.</HI> I beseech you to take
care of it. It cost me many pounds and much time, and
might have benefited, <HI>I think,</HI> an injured man. Do not
let it be lost; perhaps it may, some time or other, see
the light."</Q> It is, as requested, still carefully preserved,
<PB N="ccxx" REF="232"/>
with many other things of Mr. Berkeley's writing; for he
was never idle but whilst in company. When at his Fa∣ther's,
he retired soon after dinner, and immediately after
tea. As he very seldom ate any supper, as soon as the
cloth was removed, his servant notified it to him, and
he came down and entertained his friends with his enliven∣ing
conversation, and sometimes delighted the soul of his
Mother, by complying with her request to sing to her the
hymn sung by the Eton College gentlemen. It begins
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Salvator Mundi,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be asked, why the Editor, who, as an old servant of her mother's once said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I don't know Latin from English,</HI>"</Q> knows not Latin, but had two kind translators of it, and Mr. Berkeley's voice, when he sang any thing sacred, was quite divine, very like Mr. Airson's. His father, early in life, <HI>charged</HI> him never to sing in company.</NOTE>. until the servants came in to family
prayers; after which he more frequently retired to study
than to rest.</P>
<P>Few persons were ever more strongly impressed with the
terror of being called into judgement for idleness than Mr.
Berkeley. During the latter part of his illness he would
frequently exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Lord, forgive me; what an idle life
I do lead! Surely God will call me to account for it."</Q>
His Mother assured him that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> did not resemble Pharaoh's
task-masters; that the work God had then appointed him
to, was what he daily performed, bearing with the most
perfect resignation, and the sweetest, cheerful submission,
<PB N="ccxxi" REF="233"/>
his heavenly Father's gracious chastisements, for which,
when not in actual agony, he humbly, heartily, thanked
God for sending him.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's delicate attentions to his Mother's feel∣ings
were throughly amiable. When he was about three and
twenty, in the summer vacation he went down to his Fa∣ther's,
and one day said to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I might have

<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; I chose rather to come and spend some

<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"With me! how could you be such a fool?
Have not I always told you, as I used to tell your dear

<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, but, my dear Madam, the case is this:

<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"My dear, I honour, as I ever must, the ex∣treme
delicacy of your conduct towards your Mother

never hear you speak of him now."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why no, my dear Mother, I very seldom see
him. I found it <HI>quite</HI> impossible for <HI>me</HI> to do him <HI>any</HI>
good, and I was <HI>resolved</HI> that <HI>he</HI> should not do <HI>me</HI> any
harm; so by degrees I gently dropped him, intimate as
we formerly were."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccxxiii" REF="235"/>
The blessings of being throughly instructed, well∣grounded
in the true faith in early youth, is most beauti∣fully
described in a letter of the late Dr. Kenrick, Preben∣dary
of Westminster, minister of Hambledown, father of
the worthy Lady Gibbon. During Dr. Berkeley's residence
in Scotland Mr. Berkeley brought his Mother a very dirty
old Edinburgh magazine, with a leaf folded, saying, <Q REND="inline">"My
dear Madam, there is a letter that will delight you."</Q> It
was from Dr. Kenrick (the year forgot) it deserves to be
printed in letters of GOLD.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when staying at his Father's house in
Berkshire, had books constantly from Bull's circulating li∣brary
at Bath, or from Hookham's. His amiable spirit
led him always to order, that <HI>some</HI> of the allowed number
should be such as would be pleasant to his Mother. He
one day coming down into the drawing-room to tea, with
a book in his hand, said, <Q REND="inline">"Observe, now, how persons
are rewarded for serving their <HI>friends.</HI> I sent for this
book <HI>solely</HI> on my <HI>Mother's</HI> account, not meaning to read
three pages of it myself; for I am at present very busy;
and when I opened it to twirl over the leaves, I have
been so charmed by it, that I have redde every line at∣tentively;
and, when my Mother has finished it, I shall
read it over again."</Q> This book was The CALVARY of
the excellent Mr. Cumberland, just then published. Mr.
Berkeley spoke of it, <HI>as it merits to be spoken of,</HI> in all
<PB N="ccxxiv" REF="236"/>
companies. A <HI>learned critic</HI> once said, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I am sur∣prized
to hear <HI>you</HI> speak so very highly of it, who are cer∣tainly
a very excellent judge of poetry,"</Q> and began ob∣jecting
to some lines which he termed prosaic. At length
Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, it is possible there may
be more piety than poetry in some of the lines; but I
think it was worth being born, if it were only to have
written that <HI>excellent</HI> work."</Q></P>
<P>A gentleman once said to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder Mr.
Berkeley is not as vain and conceited as he is high, so
admired, so caressed, and courted, as he is in town."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley, in conversation at the other end of the room,
overhearing it, broke off, and said, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Sir, no; Mr.
Berkeley <HI>knows himself</HI> too <HI>well</HI> to be made vain. He
knows what he is equal to, and can never be <HI>fool</HI> enough
to be vain."</Q> His humility was great. When abroad, every
marked attention that was shown to him by eminent men
of great learning or high rank, he constantly, humbly,
attributed to his being the grandson of so great a man as
Bishop Berkeley, who was extremely well known and highly
respected, as a wonderful genius, in France, Italy, and Ger∣many.
Before what a late <HI>blackguard</HI> publication has called
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>a few lucky words of Mr. Pope's,</HI>"</Q> that great man, according
to the account of his very old intimate friend, the late
learned Richard Dalton, Esquire, of Lincolnshire, who,
with Sir John James, accompanied Bishop Berkeley to
<PB N="ccxxv" REF="237"/>
America, was, at least, <HI>sixty-six</HI> years old when the said
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>lucky words</HI>"</Q> were written. Bishop Berkeley was idolized
in England—before he set off for America was offered a
bishopric—used to go to St. James's, two evenings in a
week, to dispute with Dr. Samuel Clarke before Queen
Caroline, then Princess of Wales—had a magnificent gold
medal presented to him by his late Majesty when Prince

noble Goliath in punishing ingratitude and sauciness, Mr.

UNGRATEFUL Publicator did <HI>not</HI> dine at the same table

Mr. Berkeley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The account in Dr. Berkeley's own hand was lately shewn by the Editor to an acquaintance of the Publicator's—on the <HI>universal ourcry</HI> on the <HI>manner</HI> in which Dr. Berkeley and his Father are mentioned in that <HI>inimitable</HI> work, "The Life of the excellent Bishop Horne."</NOTE> one hundred and eighty-nine pounds, at dif∣ferent
times, were presented to this Publicator, which must
have been a pleasant addition to a poor curacy. <HI>Poor</HI> Dr.
Berkeley seems tacitly censured in the <HI>said</HI> publication, for
giving his honoured Patron <Q REND="inline">"<HI>no rest until he preferred a parti∣cular
friend.</HI>"</Q> The Editor has been repeatedly asked who
that was? and <HI>violent</HI> exclamation has constantly followed the
answer. A gentleman, within this week, told the Editor,
that Dr. Berkeley said to him eighteen years ago, <Q REND="inline">"Until I
had gotten preferment for <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, I used to receive all his
publications bound in blue or green Morocco, magnificently
gilt and lettered; but, since I have never received any <HI>even
in boards.</HI>"</Q> Dr. Berkeley, in procuring from Archbishop
Secker preferment for the Reverend Mr. Andrews, the in∣comparable
answerer of Bishop Warburton, served the most
grateful of men—farther this deponent saith not at present.</P>
<P>All the PUBLICATOR's letters, some very curious, were
preserved by Dr. Berkeley; some <HI>few</HI> were deposited in the
hands of the Editor, and are models of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. In one
the PUBLICATOR tells Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I begin to think it
time I got some <HI>Dignity</HI> in the Church, as I wish to keep
a <HI>Carriage.</HI> I think I should like a stall at Canterbury."</Q>
It may, perhaps, not be impertinent to remark, that the
<PB N="ccxxvii" REF="239"/>
Archbishop of Canterbury has only <HI>three</HI> stalls to dispose of;
and that at this time his Lady's nephew, the polite, elegant
Dr. Benson, and the son of his friend Bishop Berkeley,
were only <HI>poor Vicars,</HI> the one of Bray in Berks, the other
of Shepherd-Well in Kent. The PUBLICATOR seems to
have <HI>laboured</HI> to pour contempt on the name of BERKELEY;
but it was renowned in history before he was born. Every
one remembers the answer that poor Sir Roger de Coverley
received from the <HI>Royalist</HI> when he enquired the way to <HI>Anne's</HI>
Church, Soho, <Q REND="inline">"that she was a Saint before he was born,
and would be after he was hanged!!!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Spectator.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>The Editor hopes that <HI>she</HI> may not be doing what her
honoured Father-in-law never would do, when he refused to
make the least answer to any of the scurrilous things written
against him by that worse than savage monster Archbishop
King of Dublin; Bishop Berkeley saying, <Q REND="inline">"The noticing them
would be like preserving a <HI>dirty</HI> fly in AMBER."</Q> The Edi∣tor
has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley relate the following story
from his father: This old monster and Bishop Berkeley,
then Fellow of Dublin College, a <HI>little</HI> known in the
learned world, were both at dinner in Dublin at the house
of an Earl, whose title the Editor does not at present re∣collect,
but who had a beautiful Lady and an house full of
remarkably fine children. During the time of dinner, half
a score of servants in waiting, this <HI>purpled</HI> brute said,
<PB N="ccxxviii" REF="240"/>
<Q REND="inline">"Whenever I see a parcel of fine children, I <HI>always</HI> look
round the table to see which of the footmen is the father
of them."</Q> With these words he threw his <HI>devilish</HI> eyes
around the room. The Lay Peer must have been a saint
not to have ordered his domestics to drag the spiritual one
nine times through the kennel, and the Lady must have
been either an <HI>angel</HI> or a <HI>fool</HI> not instantly to have risen
from table. They, however, contented themselves with
never admitting his GRACE within their doors any more.
The late Dr. Berkeley used frequently to relate this and
two or three other stories, in order, as he used to say to
Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"to call your Mother out."</Q> To be sure,
Mrs. Berkeley used to <HI>storm nobly</HI> on these occasions, to
the great diversion of her amiable husband, who used to
ask <Q REND="inline">"What would SHE have done had she been Lady
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>?"</Q> To which she used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Why never
have visited any woman who admitted that BRUTE into
her drawing-room."</Q> An <HI>heavy</HI> punishment, to be sure;
but the Editor, insignificant as she is, has often mortified
<HI>fine</HI> ladies, even of rank, in that way. She began early.
About the age of twenty, soon after the death of her ex∣cellent
Mother, being with her younger sister at a water∣drinking
place, Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who had done <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> the
favour to live with him five years previous to
her being married to him, came thither, was visited by
every mortal; Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, &amp;c. &amp;c.
yet all this availed her <HI>poor</HI> Ladyship, with a set of horses,
<PB N="ccxxix" REF="241"/>
two men cooks, of whom she made <HI>frequent</HI> mention, and
about twenty thousand pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> like Haman
with Mordecai. These two little insignificant country
gentleman's daughters <HI>would not</HI> visit her Ladyship. They
were told, that it was <HI>ridiculous, not</HI> to do it. Some of
their relations, their superiors, told them that they <HI>ought</HI>
to do it. It availed not; they were as stubborn as two
little mules. Well; but her Ladyship would, <HI>willi nilhi,</HI>
constantly join the one who drank the waters every morn∣ing,
and converse with her. She one morning said, <Q REND="inline">"She
computed all her ill health to a bad lying-in."</Q> FAME
said, that her Ladyship never had lain-in at all.</P>
<P>The Editor and her sister always went to town every
spring from Windsor, where they resided before Mrs.
Berkeley married, for about two months or ten weeks, to
look about them, and prevent their being rusticated. At
Ranelagh, the Ridotto, &amp;c. her Ladyship never failed to
find them out, come to them, and make the kindest en∣quiries.
A woman of quality once, at an installation at
Windsor, said to Mrs. Berkeley, then Miss Frinsham,
<Q REND="inline">"How comes it that <HI>you</HI> visit Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>?"</Q></P>
<P>Miss Frinsham.—<Q REND="inline">"I visit her! who told you that I visited
her?"</Q></P>
<P>Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <Q REND="inline">"Nobody; but just now she happened to see
you, and said, 'Oh! there is Miss Frinsham; <HI>I must go,</HI>
<PB N="ccxxx" REF="242"/>
and speak to her directly;' and away she <HI>bustled.</HI> (Her
Ladyship's gait was of that description.) I thought, by
her manner, that you were very intimate."</Q></P>
<P>Miss Frinsham replied—<Q REND="inline">"It was her own fault that she
did not enjoy that <HI>honour.</HI>"</Q> The poor Lady is now
no longer an inhabitant of this world.</P>
<P>Such contempt may the most insignificant pour on
VICE. It is not saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Stand by thyself; I am holier than
thou.</HI>"</Q> God avert such pride from every <HI>real</HI> child of God.
The Editor who, during a course of forty years, has been
frequently in such skirmishes, has been often asked <Q REND="inline">"If
they may not be <HI>very</HI> penitent;"</Q> to which her constant
reply is, the poet tells us, that
<Q>" 'Tis best repenting in a coach and six."</Q></P>
<P>But the Editor has no <HI>great</HI> idea of the house-maid or the
kitchen-maid's repentance <HI>in</HI> the <HI>coach and six.</HI> Her peni∣tents
are such as the late lovely Lady of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who,
having trusted that most agreeable of wretches <HI>too far,</HI> was
ruined, and he compelled by Authority to marry her. She
was, as country-folks in Berkshire phrase it, made an <HI>honest
woman.</HI> But the Editor has been repeatedly told by an inti∣mate
excellent friend of hers, who constantly added, <Q REND="inline">"I had
probably shared the same fate as Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, if my excellent
Mother-in-law had not watched over me at eighteen, and
<PB N="ccxxxi" REF="243"/>
never left me one minute alone with <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>;"</Q>
adding, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure, had my Mother been asked whether
she would choose to leave me alone with <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> or
with a tiger, she would not have hesitated to prefer
the tiger."</Q> How different are mothers <HI>now,</HI> in these en∣lightened
days, to what they were fifty years ago! <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was
of the sly tiger kind, and seldom laid wait for
his prey in vain. This excellent lady has often told the
Editor, that after Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was married, no one ever
saw that she had an eye, for she never lifted those beau∣teous
causes of her sad fall, from the earth, scarce ever
spoke in company, but little to her most intimate friends,
and died of grief at the end of two years. Happily her
worthy Son resembles his Mother more than his Father.
This was repentance although in a coach and six, which
Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s situation in life might entitle her to, for she
was the daughter of a gentleman, and had a very good
fortune.</P>
<P>Some few years ago Dr. Berkeley, going to spend some
months at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, Mr. Monck Berkeley said to his Mo∣ther,
<Q REND="inline">"Now, my dear Mother, as soon as you get to
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, such a lady (naming the name) will visit you,
and you <HI>must</HI> return her visit. You must <HI>not</HI> know that
she broke her first husband's heart by her <HI>flirtations</HI> with
her present husband, whom she <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"But all that
is nothing, you know, to <HI>you.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear; but, I
<PB N="ccxxxii" REF="244"/>
am afraid, it will be somewhat to <HI>her</HI> one day or other;
and <HI>must</HI> is a bold word for any body to use to your Mo∣ther,
excepting it is your Father."</Q> He turned to his
Father, and said, <Q REND="inline">"I wished to hear my Mother's sentiments
of <HI>that</HI> Lady."</Q></P>
<P>It has been said before, that Mr. Berkeley could not rest
if he saw any creature in distress, from which it was possi∣ble
for him to relieve him. In the year 1787, during the
long vacation, Mr. Berkeley, with two of his Temple friends,
J. R. Baker, Esquire, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and another, very
sensible, amiable, young gentleman, now no more, took a trip
to the continent. During their residence there, Mr. Berkeley
had it in his power to assist, in a very awkward and unplea∣sant
situation, a very worthy amiable personage of very high
rank, his Serene Highness the then reigning Prince of Saxe
Gotha, uncle to the King of England. The circumstances
attending this transaction are too long to be related here.
In the vessel the Prince saw and admired Mr. Berkeley's
wonderfully curious Highland dog of a very scarce breed, so
much as to make Mr. Berkeley often regret that he could
not prevail upon himself to present him to his Serene High∣ness;
but adding, <Q REND="inline">"My faithful companion so many hun∣dred
miles, in so many different countries, I found I
could not part with OSCAR."</Q> Mr. Berkeley's honest
Scot, Richie, did the honours of Oscar, told his serene
Highness many wonderful, yet actually true, stories of the
<PB N="ccxxxiii" REF="245"/>
sagacity, fidelity, <HI>prudence,</HI> of that lovely beast. On the
discovery of the Duke's rank, poor Ritchie said to his
master, <Q REND="inline">"Laird, Sir, what an a sad thing it is that I must
lave ye!"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Leave me, Ritchie! Why must you
leave me? Have you got a better place, laddy?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.—<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, no; but I can never go back to
England."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why not, Ritchie?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, Sir, that elderly gentleman that talked
so much to you is the King's uncle: Laird have mercy
upon me, and that ever <HI>I</HI> should not know it, and should
dare to talk to him so about the dog—to be sure, the
King will have me hanged if I go back to England. I
will stay till you go, and then contrive, if I can, to slip
into Scotland."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley answered for his Majesty; but some of Mr.
Berkeley's English friends, to divert themselves, encouraged
poor Ritchie's fears. His Serene Highness at parting ex∣pressed
his gratitude for Mr. Berkeley's services, and most
condescendingly said, <Q REND="inline">"I find, Sir, that you are a great
traveller. I hope, sometime or other, that curiosity (al∣though
we have not much of curious) may lead you to
my Court, where I shall be most happy to return your
<PB N="ccxxxiv" REF="246"/>
wonderfully kind attentions to me by every respect in
my power."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley used often to say, <Q REND="inline">"Ritchie is a true Scot,
he will not own that he sees (like the pumkins in the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The well-known story of the English gentleman's ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear tree—and the foolish vain Scot saying he had seen the like <Q REND="inline">"in the Duke of Argyle's garden in Scotland."</Q> No person is ridiculous for <HI>unavoidable</HI> ignorance—every person, of every nation, for pretending to knowledge they do not possess.</NOTE> Duke of Argyle's garden) any thing of any kind better
in England than in Scotland."</Q> One day, when Mr.
Berkeley came down to dinner, he said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I must
confess, Ritchie has at length vanquished me, just when I
plumed myself on victory. As he was dressing my hair,
just now, it occurred to me I will ask Richie, if ever he
saw a crusade in Scotland, and see if he will answer, O
yes, Sir, in the <HI>Loodons,</HI> i. e. the Lothians. I put the
question, Ritchie, did you ever see a crusade?"</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.—<Q REND="inline">"Crusade, Sir? what an a thing is it? is it
any beasty?"</Q> <HI>i. e.</HI> a beast.</P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; it is a great number of people collected
together to go to Jerusalem to recover it out of the hands
of the Infidels."</Q></P>
<P>Ritchie.—<Q REND="inline">"O! yes, Sir; I have seen that in the Loo∣dons
(his native county). When you were in Edinburgh
last, you gave me leave to visit my friends; and I heard
<PB N="ccxxxv" REF="247"/>
of them, and went to the wood where they were all
waiting to go to Jerusalem."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley then recollected to have heard in Edin∣burgh,
that there were a few deluded poor creatures who
had assembled themselves in a wood, expecting to be con∣veyed
through the air to the Holy Land. Their numbers
increased prodigiously afterwards, as was related, and a long
account was given of them in some Magazine, the Editor
thinks the Gentleman's. What became of these poor de∣luded
souls she does not recollect to have heard; but Mr.
Berkeley, laughing, said, <Q REND="inline">"I must now give it up as a gone
cause, the hope of finding out any thing Ritchie has not
seen in the Loodons."</Q></P>
<P>The PUBLICATOR, as mentioned before, very soon found
out that he did not like the situation of his living. Poor
Dr. Berkeley was <HI>worried</HI> to besiege good Archbishop Secker
to exchange it for another; one with a better house, and
<HI>much</HI> better income, was soon given to this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>particular,</HI>"</Q>
this GRATEFUL friend; where he commenced his ac∣quaintance,
and, by the <HI>elegance</HI> of his manners, soon
formed that <HI>intimacy</HI> with the present Sir Edward Dering,
Baronet, of Surrenden, which, for many months, afforded
so much amusement in West Kent, and even in East Kent.
His contentions with that gentleman, concerning game,
could not be that he might send some to his friend, Dr.
<PB N="ccxxxvi" REF="248"/>
Berkeley; for he never, in his whole life, sent him even a
lark.</P>
<P>Some time after the PUBLICATOR had been gratified
by the exchange of his living, Dr. Berkeley went, as he
frequently did, to make a visit of some weeks at Lambeth.
The first day at dinner his Grace accosted him thus: <Q REND="inline">"Dr.
Berkeley, I HEAR that your friend Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> has
been in town for about a fortnight. <HI>I hear</HI> it, for I can∣not
say <HI>I saw</HI> him. He did not find his way to Lam∣beth."</Q>
Poor Dr. Berkeley sat abashed at, as he termed it,
the brutal folly, to say nothing of the <HI>ingratitude,</HI> of this
<HI>particular</HI> friend, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"I hope that your Grace
must have been misinformed."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, my good young
gentleman, I have not been misinformed;" (then
quickening his voice, as he frequently did;) "for he was
seen driving over Westminster-bridge in a hackney-coach,"
(the <HI>Publicator</HI> had not <HI>then</HI> a carriage of his own;) "and,"
(quickening his voice still more) "in <HI>many</HI> other parts
of the town."</Q> To this no answer could <HI>possibly</HI> be made.
A <HI>mourne silence</HI> followed, until broken by that loveliest
of women, the angelic, the incomparable Miss Talbot, who,
to relieve her distressed friend, introduced some <HI>pleasanter</HI>
subject, than the marvellous (as Dr. Berkeley termed
it) conduct of the <HI>particular</HI> friend. Dr. Berkeley, at
his return home, appeared extemely chagrined on re∣lating
it.</P>
<P><PB N="ccxxxvii" REF="249"/>
Some time after, on taxing the <HI>Publicator</HI> with his un∣accountably strange conduct, he excused himself very <HI>cle∣verly,</HI>
by saying, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, I believe I should have gone, but
I had not time; for, to tell you the truth, <HI>I</HI> went to
London (always to a friend's house) to shew <HI>Beely</HI> and
<HI>Peggy</HI> the wax-work, and the monuments, and the lions,
and every thing."</Q> It was very lucky that it did not occur
to him to carry <HI>Beely</HI> and <HI>Peggy</HI> to <HI>dinner</HI> with his Grace on
a <HI>public</HI> day, and shew them the Lollards Tower there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Publicator</HI> seems to have taken pains to tack at the
very end of the list of Bishop Horne's friend's Dr. (then
George Berkeley, Esquire)—a <HI>real</HI> Esquire, from his poor,
<HI>unknown</HI> Father's rank in life, and expending every year at
Oxford, as he has repeatedly told the Editor,—not in vice,
She is sure, as his excellent Father said, when, on his arrival
in Oxford, Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"I am ashamed, my Lord, to
say that I have spent six hundred pounds in four months—here
is the account."</Q> The Bishop made the above generous
reply, <Q REND="inline">"Not in vice, I am sure, child,"</Q> and threw the account
into the fire. It was great part in virtue. A servant to wait on
himself, and a groom for his horses, could not be reckoned
extravagant. A young man, who never tasted wine, could
not spend more than a thousand pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> but,
having never been, according to his Son, <HI>buffeted</HI> through a
public school, and being quite unacquainted with charac∣ters,
he was perpetually imposed on by designing, ungrate∣ful,
<PB N="ccxxxviii" REF="250"/>
young men, to whom he was <HI>too</HI> bountiful, as appears
by his accounts, now in the Editor's possession, from the
day he arrived at Christ Church. He is receiving his re∣ward;
<HI>they,</HI> no doubt, <HI>will</HI> receive theirs. Much went in
charity to real, frequently unknown, objects.</P>
<P>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley say, that
one morning at Christ Church, his servant shaving him,
he redde a sermon preached on charity for lying-in women
in Aldersgate-Street. The preacher, the Editor thinks a Pre∣late,
described the miseries of <HI>poor</HI> women in those circum∣stances
so pathetically, that Dr. Berkeley said <Q REND="inline">"I, a young
man, had never thought on. I felt it so strongly, that,
with one half of my chin unshaved, I made my servant
lay down the razor, catched up a sheet of paper, wrote to
my banker an order to pay to the treasure of the hospital
fifty pounds, to make me a governor for life, for fear I
should be at any time unwilling to pay the annual sub∣scription."</Q></P>
<P>Some Scotch friend, the Editor has not been able to dis∣discover
who has celebrated Dr. Berkeley's charities to the
poor, during his <HI>séjour</HI> with his Son at the University of St.
Andrew's, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that he every year gave away above
two hundred pounds with his own hands."</Q> This is a
mistake. He very seldom did give with his own elegant
hands, unless his wife's may be called his own; for unless,
<PB N="ccxxxix" REF="251"/>
which was frequently the case, he inclosed in a blank cover
a ten, often a twenty pound bank note, to any person, una∣ble
to <HI>ask,</HI> though not to <HI>receive</HI> charity, whose face he had
never seen, only heard from good authority of their distress.
How often has he thus <Q REND="inline">"<HI>made the widow's heart to sing for
joy,</HI>"</Q> and with holy Job <Q REND="inline">"the blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon him."</Q> In other instances,
with regard to the surrounding poor, he always left the
pleasing task on Mrs. Berkeley; constantly saying, <Q REND="inline">"I
never trouble myself; my wife is my almoner;"</Q> adding,
as Mrs. Berkeley once said to her excellent kind friend Dr.
Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury, on his asking her con∣cerning
a poor old man, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> know nothing of him; when
<HI>once</HI> I have introduced an object of charity to you, or
Mrs. Tatton, (one of the charitable daughters of the <HI>nobly</HI>
charitable Dean and Mrs. Lynch,) <HI>I</HI> never trouble myself
<HI>any more</HI> about them, but search out some new objects,
well knowing that <HI>they</HI> will have ample abundant care
taken of <HI>them.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>A Scotch minister was once celebrating to Mrs. Berkeley
the <HI>vast</HI> charities of the LATE Earl of Lauderdale—a very
worthy Nobleman HE was. He began by saying, <Q REND="inline">"His cha∣rities
are <HI>amazingly great</HI> indeed. As surely as you sit
there, Madam, that man puts a <HI>guinea</HI> into the plate, (a
plate at every kirk door, guarded by two ruling elders,)
<PB N="ccxl" REF="252"/>
every Sabbath day, and every year three guineas at the
<HI>Occasion</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The annual kirk sacrament, to which a cook of the Editor's, lamentable to tell, returned so often to the kirk that she was shamefully intoxicated. The expence of wine on these <HI>Occasions</HI> is said to be very great indeed, that of bread very small.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Lord Lauderdale has, I know,
not a large <HI>paternal</HI> estate; but he married a very
worthy friend of mine, the daughter of Sir Thomas
Loombe, with an English fortune of four thousand
pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> so that lending fifty-three guineas an∣nually
to the Lord <HI>I</HI> do not consider as being so very
bountiful as you Sir, do. I will now tell you of a
bountiful donor to the poor, the late Dean of Canter∣bury,
father to our equally charitable, amiable ambassa∣dor
at Turin, Sir William Lynch. The Dean had a
large paternal estate, married one of the daughters of
Archbishop Wake with a large fortune, and had consi∣derable
church preferment: now guess what he gave an∣nually
to the poor."</Q></P>
<P>Scotch Minister.—<Q REND="inline">"I cannot tell."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Guess."</Q></P>
<P>Scotch Min.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, perhaps he might give them a
hundred pounds a year."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccxli" REF="253"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; but he gave them nearer to a thou∣sand;
for of all his vast income, it is universally known
at Canterbury, and forty miles round, that he constantly
gave to the poor ten pounds out of every hundred he
received, from whatever quarter it came, beside all sort
of good things made for the sick poor in his kitchen and
store-room. And to this, that he kept open house for
rich and poor; and when the silk manufactory (now,
alas! no more) was at a low ebb, he nobly asked,
'Will my new furnishing the deanery with silk damask
help to raise it?' and being answered in the affirmative,
he instantly ordered five hundred pounds worth of furni∣ture
damask to be wove, which saved it at that time."</Q></P>
<P>It is to be hoped, when a score or two more of ladies
have been burnt to death by wearing muslin gowns in win∣ter
(<HI>absurd, ridiculous, foolish</HI> fashions) that the Editor's
poor honest <HI>quondam</HI> neighbours may again use their
looms. If the Editor's leisure had permitted, she would
have advised them, in the Canterbury news-papers, not to
elect any member to represent their antient city in the new
Parliament, who would not promise to <HI>make</HI> his wife and
daughters wear silk gowns, at least during the winter season.
The Inhabitants of Canterbury are surely as respectable as
those of Manchester, who will not admit of their printed∣linens
being <HI>slightly</HI> taxed.</P>
<P><PB N="ccxlii" REF="254"/>
The Editor has had occasion to remark that the PUBLI∣CATOR
was not very forward to make any grateful return
for any favour bestowed on him; for he never presented
his friend Dr. Berkeley even with a lark<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. ccxxxvi.</NOTE>. It is com∣monly
said, that in the county of Berks during the partridge
season there are as many guns as birds; therefore game is
always a most agreeable present, especially to those who
keep much company; and frequently, in their several sea∣sons,
would arrive hares, partridges, pheasants, &amp;c. from
the very grateful Mr. Andrews, of Marden in Kent. He
never suffered any neighbour to go to London without re∣questing
him to take some game, and send it down by the
Maidenhead coach. The year that Archbishop Secker
presented Mr. Andrews to this living, apples sailed in every
county of England except Kent; which is no great wonder,
since the farmers of that county pay most careful attention
to their trees in winter, clearing them of all dead wood,
moss, &amp;c. Mr. Andrews packed up his whole crop of
apples in hampers, and sent them all, except a <HI>very few</HI>
stinted ones. Apples that year were such rarities, that
Mrs. Berkeley suggested to Dr. Berkeley to send them to
Lambeth Palace; which was speedily done, a few only be∣ing
reserved as curiosities; and a most acceptable offering
they proved. Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley going to make some
stay at Lambeth Palace soon after, the first day after din∣ner
from some apples being on the table, the Archbishop, with
<PB N="ccxliii" REF="255"/>
his wonted politeness, said, <Q REND="inline">"Lady and Gentleman, will
you not eat some of your <HI>own</HI> fine apples? How came it
to pass that <HI>your</HI> trees produced this wonderfully scarce
year?"</Q> To which Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my
good Lord, we had not a score on all our trees. They
are the grateful offering of a very grateful man, Mr.
Andrews; and my wife thought that, as <HI>we</HI> owed the
apples to your Grace's goodness to him, they ought, in
<HI>conscience,</HI> to be sent to your Grace:"</Q> who, with his ac∣customed
pleasantry, turning to Mrs. Berkeley, who had
the honour to be a great favourite with his Grace, said,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, my good young lady, I don't know that I ought
to accept <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se apples.</HI> I am afraid they are a <HI>little simo∣niacal.</HI>"</Q>
To which Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! no,
my Lord: if they had come <HI>before</HI> your Grace had
preferred Mr. Andrews, it might have been a case for
Bishop Taylor's <HI>Ductor Dubitantium;</HI> but, I think, as it
is, your Grace may eat them with a <HI>very safe conscience.</HI>"</Q>
His Grace laughed heartily, and said, <Q REND="inline">"I remember Arch
bishop Potter used to tell of a man whom he had given
a small living, on which grew a remarkably fine pear∣tree.
He used every year to send the pears to Lambeth.
His Grace gave him a second, much better, living; and
he used to say, 'Whether the pear-tree <HI>died,</HI> or the pears
were <HI>blighted every year,</HI> I know not; but I know that I
<HI>never saw another pear</HI> after I gave the <HI>second</HI> living."</Q> This
GRATEFUL man did not, probably, like the PUBLICATOR,
<PB N="ccxliv" REF="256"/>
expect one of the <HI>three</HI> stalls at Canterbury. He was at
least <HI>modest,</HI> if ungrateful.</P>
<P>It is not possible to avoid contrasting two men, both of
whom were indebted for their first comfortable establish∣ment
in life to the exquisite amiability of Dr. Berkeley
the Reverend Dr. Glasse and the PUBLICATOR. When
Mr. Monck Berkeley was about six or seven years old, Dr.
Glasse said, more than once, <Q REND="inline">"If you and Mrs. Berkeley
would confide your little man to me, how happy should
I be! what care and attention I would pay him! and I
am sure, if you would condescend to <HI>accept</HI> it, I desire
neither fee nor reward."</Q> The last grateful offer was of
course thankfully declined; and from Mr. Berkeley's birth
his Father determined, that, if God spared his life, he
should be educated at a Public School; often lamenting
that the good Bishop had not sent <HI>him</HI> to one, particularly
after his son grew up, often saying, <Q REND="inline">"he had then got a
second guardian."</Q> Bishop Berkeley, at one time, for se∣veral
years paid four hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to different
masters to instruct his children in Music, Painting, Fencing,
Riding, and French; the Latin and Greek he entrusted to
none but himself. His sons were never suffered either to
ride or walk out unattended by a careful servant.</P>
<P>When Dr. Berkeley came to Oxford, at the age of nine∣teen,
attended by a most respectable worthy Chaplain of
<PB N="ccxlv" REF="257"/>
his Father's, and his own servant, he had never rode a mile
alone; and he had contracted an habit of meditating and
composing on horseback, which occasioned his being the
most careless of riders, leaving the horse's bridle so very
loose, that he was perpetually thrown. Soon after his
marriage, Mrs. Berkeley, finding this to be the case, made
it a point that he never should ride without a servant.
When Mr. Berkeley grew up, he joined in what Dr. Berke∣ley
called his Mother's <HI>persecution,</HI> and one day said, <Q REND="inline">"What
is the reason, I would fain know, why your Mother lets
you ride fifty miles without a servant, and over hedge
and ditch, nobody knows where, hunting, and won't let
me ride to Taplow or Maidenhead alone?"</Q> To which
Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! my dear Sir, if <HI>you</HI> had been
<HI>buffeted</HI> for seven years though Eton School, <HI>I dare say, my</HI>
Mother would have let you ride alone as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley constantly hunted with buck-hounds twice a week—frequently with Mr. Clayton's hounds. It was not <HI>so quietly</HI> as Mr. Monck Berkeley sup∣posed; for Dr. Berkeley used to say, on hunting days, <Q REND="inline">"<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> prays the whole morning—let me go into the dressing-room ever so often, I am sure to hear—"Berkeley is not come home—GOD watch over him, and send him safe." These ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon. They were certainly heard by HIM who heareth prayer, and, as it should seem, answered; for Mr. Berkeley never once got a fall in hunting—he rode remarkably well."</Q> He never would cross his Majesty in the chase. He used frequently to express indignation at a hunting butcher, particularly well mounted, who used to cross so as sometimes to endanger his Majesty; saying, <Q REND="inline">"What can the fellow be made of, to be such a savage?"</Q> to which Dr. Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Why, of bulls hides, to be sure."</Q></NOTE> quietly as she
<PB N="ccxlvi" REF="258"/>
does me; but that is out of the question, for ride alone
you must not; that is agreed on all hands."</Q> To which
Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure, you are obliged to <HI>me,</HI>
Sir. I wish I had been buffeted <HI>any where</HI> in my youth,
as you have been, you rogue."</Q></P>
<P>But to return from this digression to the contrast of, as
Mrs. George Berkeley ever termed him, the really grateful
Dr. Glasse. We have seen his kind offer, in the preceding
page; we will now proceed to the PUBLICATOR's polite re∣fusal.
When Archbishop Cornwallis visited at Canterbury,
he was of course at the Deanery. It was impossible that
the attendant Bishop should be also lodged there. On a
consultation concerning the place where he should be re∣ceived
and entertained, not one of the Prebendaries seemed
desirous of that honour. The generous hospitable Dr.
Lynch was not then a member of the choir; and it must in
justice be said, that numbers of the Prebendaries, who are
not in office, let their prebendal houses, and are only visitors
or boarders to their tenants; so they have it not in their
power to receive any one. It was suggested that the Pre∣late
must be contented to go to one of the miserably bad,
excessively dear, inns in the city. This shocked Dr.
Berkeley, although only the son of a poor UNKNOWN Irish
Prelate; and he instantly said, <Q REND="inline">"Bad as my house is, it is
better than a nasty dirty inn; he shall be my guest."</Q> As
soon as it was known who the attending Bishop was, Dr.
<PB N="ccxlvii" REF="259"/>
Berkeley wrote a polite letter, requesting the honour of
having his Lordship for his guest. Mrs. Berkeley requested
her amiable consort to permit her to invite his lady, with
whom she had the honour to be acquainted, and whose
lovely eldest sister, sweet, beautiful Miss Maddox, was a
beloved friend of her childhood. Bishop Maddox, when a
Welsh bishop, had for several summers a house at East
Burnham, in the neighbourhood of White Waltham. That
lovely creature died early. The Editor cherishes, with
tender care, a keepsake, a small silver medal, given by the
good Bishop to his sweet daughter, to present to her little
friend.</P>
<P>Some days before the arrival of the Archbishop, &amp;c.
Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"the children (then both living at home
and going to Dr. Beauvoir's school) will be horridly in
the servants' way, for we must keep open house for a
fortnight. What can we do with them?"</Q> Mrs. Berke∣ley
said, <Q REND="inline">"She would contrive it as well as she could: they
should get a cold dinner at one, and be off to play di∣rectly."</Q>
Mrs. Frinsham, then at Dr. Berkeley's, said,
<Q REND="inline">"You know I am going to Ramsgate, and I will take <HI>one.</HI>"</Q>
It was Dr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"You are very kind; you
shall take Robert: and it has just occurred to me that
I will send Berkeley to *****; HE will be glad of an
opportunity of obliging ME."</Q> Dr. Berkeley was, alas!
ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable self. De∣lighted
<PB N="ccxlviii" REF="260"/>
with this idea, he wrote to the PUBLICATOR,
stating his situation, and saying, <Q REND="inline">"On such a day John will
deliver into your care my eldest boy for a fortnight; at
the expiration of which I shall fetch him home."</Q> By
the return of the post, Dr. Berkeley received a letter from
the PUBLICATOR, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that he was very sorry that it
so happened that he could not possibly receive his little
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor spelt, but always so pronounced, by the <HI>elegant</HI> Publicator, when speaking of the young gentlemen his boarders—<Q REND="inline">"My bouys"</Q>—or of his own son, who was a remarkably elegant lad. The Editor has not seen him since he was a very pleasing youth, when she advised his father, in return for the Latin and Greek he taught his son, to make him teach him a little politeness. Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Nobody flatters ***** like <HI>my wife;</HI>"</Q> on which Mrs. Berkeley fired, and said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> flatter him! how can you say so?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Nay, I will prove it; for, whenever he is here, you won't suffer any body else to speak; but say, do pray hold you tongueS, that <HI>I</HI> may hear what ***** says,"</Q> about Botany, Farming, &amp;c. in which he is well skilled.</NOTE><HI>bouy;</HI> but that he had just settled all matters to take his
pupils to the sea, to shew them the shipping, and give
them a week's pleasure;—it was unlucky, but it could
not be helped."</Q> Dr. Berkeley flew with this letter to
Mrs. Berkeley, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Well, this is the luckiest thing
in the world;"</Q> then redde the epistle; observing, <Q REND="inline">"it
will make Berkeley" (just then turned of eleven years
old, and, as an excellent judge used to say, "the best-bred
properly behaved child of that age in England; no af∣fected
manly airs, but a sweetly polite lad") "as happy
as a prince, poor fellow."</Q> Dr. Berkeley notified this
by letter immediately to the PUBLICATOR, who <HI>instantly</HI>
<PB N="ccxlix" REF="261"/>
returned the following <HI>elegant, grateful,</HI> answer. The let∣ter
is carefully preserved. <Q REND="inline">"My dear Friend, (his constant
familiar address to Dr. Berkeley,) <HI>I cannot</HI> help thinking
<HI>you very unreasonable,</HI> in wanting to fasten your Son upon
<HI>me,</HI> especially at a time when I have told you, that
<HI>I cannot</HI> take him."</Q> The letter goes on in the same <HI>ele∣gant</HI>
style. Poor Dr. Berkeley was, for the time, <HI>very, very</HI>
angry indeed; and Mrs. Berkeley <HI>maliciously</HI> laughed at the
<HI>gratitude</HI> of his <HI>dear Friend.</HI> After some time, Dr. Berkeley
wrote a letter to the Publicator; and, as was frequently
his custom, when going out to dinner, passing from his
study, threw half a dozen letters on the table in Mrs.
Berkeley's dressing-room, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I am in haste; I shall
be distanced; pray seal these unsealed ones; and send
them all; with, yours, to post."</Q> The letter to the <HI>grate∣ful</HI>
Friend was safely sealed; and Mrs. Berkeley, having
very little of our grandmother Eve's curiosity in her com∣position,
did not ask permission to read it; but, hollowing
it up, she, with a good pen, wrote, as plainly as she could
contrive to do, the little word <HI>gratitude.</HI> Off went the letter
to the post. In a few days Dr. Berkeley, coming into the
drawing-room to tea, said, <Q REND="inline">"I have got a letter from
*****, in which he seems much disquieted. He asks
what could possibly induce some member of my family to
write on the edge of the inside of the letter I last wrote to
him the word <HI>gratitude.</HI> My dear, do you know any thing
about it?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, from her cradle, to (she
<PB N="ccl" REF="262"/>
trusts) her coffin, too proud to tell a lie, instantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"To be sure I do; for <HI>I</HI> wrote it."</Q>—Dr. Berkeley said,
<Q REND="inline">"Why would you write?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Because <HI>I</HI> think it a <HI>mighty
pretty word.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Your wrath against *****, like most
violent blazes, has abated."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor cannot dismiss the PUBLICATOR without re∣marking,
that, had it pleased the Divine Goodness to have
spared Dr. Berkeley to have seen the contempt <HI>endeavoured</HI>
to be thrown on his very deeply-learned, justly, universally
admired Father, his indignation would <HI>not</HI> have subsided,
as it for some time did, on account of his little Son. Dr.
Berkeley never did, never would, forgive a greater man
than even the Publicator, for speaking, as he thought, im∣properly
against his excellent Father; for which great man and
his incomparable writings he had through life the greatest
respect, <Q REND="inline">"RAMBLER John,"</Q> as Dr. Berkeley, who generally
redde a Rambler once a week, termed that great man.
His Son always called him the noble learned Bear. The
accident happening at Oxford was too well known then,
too well remembered by many gentlemen then present,
still living, to be here detailed. Suffice it therefore to say,
that Johnson's want of <HI>le savoir vivre</HI> occasioned his ridi∣culing
Bishop Berkeley's American scheme, by which he
meant to introduce Episcopacy there, always declaring, <Q REND="inline">"if
it was not done in a few years, the Colonies would revolt
from the Mother Country."</Q> The event has shown that this
<PB N="ccli" REF="263"/>
<HI>unknown</HI> Prelate was not a <HI>false</HI> Prophet. What the Father
could not accomplish, the Son contrived to bring about, by
his interest with the Scotch Bishops; the very excellent,
very deeply learned Bishop Skinner; the very pious Bishop
Falconer, who died soon after; and the amiable worthy
Sir John Strachan, Baronet; as now that he is no more
may be <HI>publicly</HI> known. In a letter to a Friend, written
some time after, Dr. Berkeley says, <Q REND="inline">"I was well aware that
it would <HI>never</HI> be forgiven, but I rejoice that I have
done it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley selt his amiable heart gratified in rendering
every possible service in his power to the repeal of Lord
Hardwicke's horrid act after the Rebellion in 1745. Had
Dr. Berkeley's advice been adhered to, the first attempt
had succeeded, when the three Scotch Prelates came over
the first time to solicit it; but in most transactions there is
generally a Marplot. Dr. Berkeley was particularly happy
in entertaining at his house in Berkshire, and endeavouring
to return the very polite hospitality of Sir John Strachan
to himself and family at Dundee, and of Bishop Skinner to
his Son when at Aberdeen, where Mr. Monck Berkeley had
the freedom of the city presented to him, as he had of se∣veral
other cities and towns in Scotland, and a licence pre∣sented
to shoot on very manor wherever he went. He
spent near a fortnight at Taymouth most agreeably. The
Editor fears to trust her once retentive, now, alas! trea∣cherous
<PB N="cclii" REF="264"/>
memory, to say, of sixteen gentlemen who sat down
to dinner, every day, how many were John Campbell. This
came out accidentally. Some one, not knowing Mr. Berke∣ley's
partiality for Scotland, said, <Q REND="inline">"How ridiculous they
are, calling themselves by the names of their estates!"</Q>
Mr. Berkeley reddened, and said, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Sir, why so?
how would you have them distinguish themselves?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why, by their Christian names, as we do."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"That
will not do, Sir. The mode of distinguishing several
brothers in a public school, <HI>major, minor,</HI> &amp;c. will not
do; nor will <HI>first, second, third,</HI> do."</Q> He then men∣tioned
as above related. The worthy learned Laird of Aha∣ladar
(certainly not spelt right by the Editor, although so
pronounced) and his accomplished, amiable, eldest son,
both much beloved by Mr. Berkeley were two of near half
a score John Campbells. Mr. Berkeley retained a most
grateful sense of the kind, elegant hospitality at Ahaladar.
Talking frequently, after his return from College, of Jack
Ahaladar, his brother asked, <Q REND="inline">"Who is Jack Ahaladar, of
whom you talk so much?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, the <HI>young</HI> Laird, a
charming young man—YOU would like <HI>him.</HI>"</Q>—Probably
now the elegant Laird of Ahaladar, as the Editor thinks she
was told the worthy old Laird is dead. He presented Mr.
Berkeley with a very curious original letter, which, when
the Editor can afford to print the second volume of Literary
Relics, will be published in it.</P>
<P><PB N="ccliii" REF="265"/>
To return from this digression. Dr. Johnson had no
sooner finished his rude sentence, than Dr. (then Mr.) Berke∣ley,
then a little turned of twenty, rose from his seat,
reached his cap, made his bow, and, to the no small
distress of the gentleman who had invited him to meet
Dr. Johnson, quitted the room in great indignation before
supper. On some of the company, intimates of Dr. John∣son,
reproaching him for his <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> conduct, HE made a sort
of <HI>amende honorable,</HI> by saying, <Q REND="inline">"Why, I think the Bishop's
scheme no bad one; but I abused it, to take down the
young gentleman, lest he should be too vain of having
had SUCH A FATHER."</Q> Some one presumed to say Mr.
Berkeley was exquisitely well-bred, not at all insolent; to
which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, not at all, but I thought it might
do him good to mortify him <HI>a little.</HI>"</Q> Dr. Johnson wished to
have written the Bishop's life; but Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"he would
not furnish him with any documents;"</Q> which Mr. Monck
Berkeley used exceedingly to regret, saying to his Father,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, it will never be so written as Johnson would
have written it;"</Q> to which Dr. Berkeley used to reply,
<Q REND="inline">"It may be so; but I was resolved HE should not write it.
You may, if you please."</Q> Dr. Johnson, through a com∣mon
friend, made many attempts to visit Dr. Berkeley in
Berkshire, and once said, <Q REND="inline">"I have a good mind to go down
to Cookham, and see what they would say to me."</Q> Mrs.
Berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have said,
<Q REND="inline">"We should be very happy to see him;"</Q> but his reply was
<PB N="ccliv" REF="266"/>
<Q REND="inline">"No; the man that could speak slightingly of my great
Father shall never be entertained under his Son's roof."</Q>
It is therefore probable, that this respectful mention of
Bishop Berkeley by the PUBLICATOR would have completed
the business begun by the smothering of the Consecration
Sermon for four years.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley preserved all the letters he received, except
now and then one, which he flung into the fire before he
appeared to have redde it through; and, like his Father and
Dean Swift, some he never opened at all, but threw them
into a drawer. After his lamented death, the Editor found
a baker's dozen (fourteen) from a fleecing Ingrate, with
the seal unbroken, as she told the man when obliged to
hold a short conversation with him. It has been often said
of the Editor's grandfather, the celebrated Francis Cherry,
Esquire, that he met with more Ingrates than any other man
ever did. I suppose of most persons of very large fortunes
and very liberal minds, it may, with equal truth, be as∣serted.
Dr. Berkeley's fortune was by no means large, but
his <HI>soul</HI> was noble. He, by his wise advice and direction,
made the fortunes of great numbers. Mrs. Berkeley used
often to say to him, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, you can make the
fortune of every one you take in hand, but your∣self
and your Son, and you will not stir a stroke for
<HI>him.</HI>"</Q> His reply constantly was, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot help it.
I cannot ask or push for myself or for him. If others do
<PB N="cclv" REF="267"/>
not, it must remain undone by me."</Q> Both are now hap∣pily
provided for by <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that Friend who sticketh closer than a
brother;</HI>"</Q> both are receiving the reward of their labour of
love to real friends and base ingrates, whom may God, for
Christ's sake, forgive, prays the Editor.</P>
<P>Having been <HI>obliged, necessarily obliged,</HI> to descant so much
on that odious temper of the mind, INGRATITUDE, she turns,
with double, treble pleasure, to what her beloved, respected,
friend Mrs. Duncombe has ever obligingly observed, is the
prominent feature in her character; to whom that lady has
repeatedly said, <Q REND="inline">"No one can do any thing for you but give
you a dish of tea, (a very delightful solace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pleasure <HI>now</HI> almost totally lost to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a poor old-fashioned creature,</HI>"</Q> who does not like that solace at half-past seven or eight; she not being able to sleep without a small quantity of malt-liquor, a most excellent safe narcotic; so much so, that, for very many years, she never took it at night, as it prevented her rising at five in the morning—when she was young to improve her own mind, afterwards to attend to her childrens. Not long ago, about a quarter after nine, just as the Editor was sitting down to her slice of French roll and glass of beer, her servant announcing the arrival of a Lady in the drawing-room, the Editor involuntarily said, <Q REND="inline">"If it had been five minutes later, I had supped, and it would have been so pleasant to have enjoyed <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> conversation after supper;"</Q> which was that night unavoidably deferred until <HI>half-past ten.</HI> The Editor rejoices that her spirit is not as wilful as her sadly weakened stomach, which suffers direfully, if it does not get the <HI>very small</HI> din∣ner it will receive at three, and so on in course, according to the VULGAR hours in use 40 years ago.</NOTE>, surely, in
pleasant company,) without your setting about to think
what <HI>return</HI> you shall make them."</Q> The Editor ever
<PB N="cclvi" REF="268"/>
did, still does, labour, as Lord Burleigh, in his letter, ad∣vises
his son ROBERT, on a <HI>very</HI> different principle, (to advance
his OWN interest,) <Q REND="inline">"to find out <HI>something</HI> that may be ac∣ceptable
to his great and noble friends."</Q> The Editor
having been, still being, joint possessor, with her excellent
Sister, of some curious things collected by their accom∣plished
grandfather Francis Cherry, Esquire, a great Anti∣quary,
and curious Collector, before Antiquarian Societies
were formed, has generally been so fortunate as to select
some token of her gratitude to offer to her Son's friends of
highest rank, more substantial than words, well remem∣bering
the saying of a witty old servant of her Mother's,
who lived with her before the Editor's birth, and died, at
near an hundred, last summer. This worthy woman's un∣common
wit introduced her as nurse to all the lying-in
ladies, and sick gentlemen and ladies, in the neighbourhood,
whose spirits she, by her wit, kept up when the apotheca∣ry's
cordial failed to do it, This humane woman, when
at her own home, always nursed the poorest of her neigh∣bours
<HI>gratis.</HI> She was a pious woman, and is now re∣ceiving
the reward of her <Q REND="inline">"labours of love."</Q> She, when
persons said <HI>much</HI> and did <HI>little,</HI> would, looking archly, sing,
from an old song,<Q><L>"Aye, aye,</L>
<L>"Words, <HI>fine</HI> words, are <HI>but</HI> WIND," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="cclvii" REF="269"/>
So <HI>has</HI> ever thought the Editor, so <HI>may</HI> she ever think
whilst she possesses any thing else to offer. But there are
those who withhold <HI>even</HI> those; witness the learned PUBLI∣CATOR,
and another <HI>infamous</HI> INGRATE, who owed to Dr.
Berkeley wonderful obligations indeed, being in the receipt
of near two thousand pounds <HI>per annum</HI> at the time of his
death; but he is spared for the present, his excellent amia∣ble
brother having accidentally stumbled once on Mr.
Monck Berkeley at Bath, and having there, and ever after,
until his death, paid him every polite, respectful attention;
and it would wound the lovely tender heart of that gentle∣man,
to see his worthless brother's corrupt, base, putrid,
heart dissected. Some few years before his universally <HI>un∣lamented</HI>
death, he CONDESCENDED to visit Dr. Berkeley,

Berkeley generously lent him one hundred pounds, to get
things a little decent in his house, and had some difficulty,
a few years after, to get it repaid. Dr. Berkeley was gone
out on horseback. Mrs. Berkeley heard the bell of the
front gate ring. Nobody appearing, she rang, to enquire
who it was; the servant above named said, <Q REND="inline">"It was Dr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"How came it that he he did not come in?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I told him, Madam, that my Master was out: he asked

I told him that my Master and you were going out to
dinner,—and I believed you were dressing."</Q> This honest
man, when waiting at table, had so often heard the Ho∣nourable

abuse <HI>this</HI> INGRATE's <HI>shameful</HI> inattention to Dr.
Berkeley, that he very naturally <HI>supposed</HI> his Mistress, who
ever resented <HI>ten</HI> times more for her friends than for her∣self,
was not very partial to him. He is no longer an in∣habitant
of this world. Dr. Berkeley's goodness probably
hastened his removal to <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, <HI>another</HI> world.</P>

other amiably grateful.</P>
<P><PB N="cclix" REF="271"/>
Some days before Archbishop Cornwallis's arrival at Can∣terbury,
as before mentioned, one afternoon the servant
announced the arrival of that loveliest of women, in mind
as well as person, the late Mrs. Tucker. As soon as seated,
she began, in her sweetly musical voice, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that,
having heard that Dr. Berkeley was to have the attendant
Bishop for his guest," she came to beg that Master
Berkeley might be her guest for the next fortnight, that
she had prepared a bed for him, and that the utmost care
should be taken of him."</Q> THAT no one in the county of
Kent could doubt, where her fame, as well as in many
other counties, was, as it justly merited, blazed abroad.</P>
<P>A young gentleman of large fortune at Canterbury
School, the amiable Richard Tilden, Esquire, who boarded
at the second master's, Mr. Tucker's, was nursed by Mrs.
Tucker through a dreadful fever. Mrs. Tucker, although
then lying-in, caused his bed to be removed into her own
chamber, that <HI>she</HI> might <HI>see</HI> he got his medicines at the
appointed hours. As soon as sufficiently recovered, he was
conveyed home, where he had not been many days, when
he requested his Mother (he was an orphan) to order the
coach to carry him back to Mrs. Tucker, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that he
liked <HI>her</HI> nursing better than home nursing;"</Q> and the
request was complied with. This happened before the
Editor was resident at Canterbury, but has been frequently
<PB N="cclx" REF="272"/>
related to her by her very sensible worthy friend, the late
Lady Head, and by many other persons.</P>
<P>Mr. Tilden was a <HI>more</HI> than father to the Editor's youngest
Son, of whom he was so very fond, and to whom he was so
very kind, that the little creature one day said to his Mother,
<Q REND="inline">"Mamma, <HI>I</HI> shall never want money; for Dick Tilden (it
is the custom at Canterbury School to call the eldest and
all the Brothers by their Christian name) "bids me, when∣ever
I want a shilling, come to him; and if any great boy,
that <HI>I</HI> cannot <HI>manage,</HI> beats me, he always beats him
<HI>soundly</HI> for his pains."</Q> Mr. Tilden, when the amiable
protector of the beauteous little Robert, was eighteeny ears
old; soon going to the university, he staid to mourn the
death of his grateful little <HI>protegé.</HI> How amiable are some
youths! what <HI>odious</HI> savages are others! But the exquisite
<HI>unaffected</HI> sweetness of Mrs. Tucker, (the Editor allows <HI>unaf∣fected</HI>
sweetness, gentleness, &amp;c. &amp;c.) not only infused
sweetness into her <HI>own</HI> children, but into <HI>most</HI> of her
boarders, generally sons of the first gentlemen in the county,
often from other counties.</P>
<P>The instance of an amiably <HI>retentive</HI> grateful mind is
now to be adduced from <HI>one</HI> of those boarders. The Edi∣tor
received the account from such authority as precludes
a possibility of her having been deceived; besides, as it is
often said, <Q REND="inline">"Facts are stubborn things."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cclxi" REF="273"/>
The present Lord Thurlow, immediately on his receiving
the Great Seal, applied to a Kentish gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"Has my
dear old mistress, Mrs. Tucker, any son that I can pro∣vide
for?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, my Lord; her eldest son is but
twenty."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Don't tell ME of <HI>twenty;</HI> the living of
Gravesend shall be held for him till he is <HI>four and twen∣ty.</HI>"</Q>
That very learned, worthy, careful, now private,
instructor of youth, with his amiable partner, has been
many years at Gravesend, blessing the noble gratitude of
the generous GRATEFUL Lord Thurlow. Why is gratitude
so <HI>very rare,</HI> so <HI>scarce</HI> a plant in <HI>human</HI> hearts? but that MAN
is a FALLEN creature. Lions have it, dogs have it, in a
high degree; even the feathered tribe have it; some of the
wildest of them. The worthy woman above named, as
having served the Editor above twenty years, is, as well as
her old fellow servant, Mr. Wrightson, wonderfully tender
and kind to the brute creation; the Editor's Cook <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So much so, as to have occasioned the Housekeeper one day telling the Editor, that Mr. Wrightson and herself had at length extorted a promise from the Cook, that when she married she would <HI>not</HI> keep a cat, as they were sure she would starve it to death. The worthy woman married from Dr. Berkeley's, and her cat and self are both <HI>en bon point</HI> now living at Cookham.</NOTE> rather
negligent of them, the housekeeper amused herself with feed∣ing
a parcel of Guinea fowls, in general very wild birds. These
creatures, although never fed but once a day, used to run
flocking around her every time she went into the meadows
<PB N="cclxii" REF="274"/>
where they wandered; and more than one Sunday it was
with considerable difficulty that she got into the church
without near forty of her feathered friends escorting her.
She had reared near thirty of them, difficult as the task is,
the hens being very bad nurses. They well knew the hour
of feeding was past. It was <HI>gratitude;</HI> shame to human
nature! which the famous Dr. Cheyne used to say, <Q REND="inline">"was
<HI>without</HI> GOD'S GRACE, a compound of Brute and Devil;"</Q>
but these poor quadrupeds and winged fowl have not God's
grace, and yet <HI>they</HI> shame mankind.</P>
<P>The incomparable Mrs. Tucker is not held up here as a
grateful person in contrast to the PUBLICATOR; for <HI>she owed</HI>
no gratitude either to Dr. or to Mrs. Berkeley, unless it was for
uniting with the <HI>whole</HI> church, city, and neighbourhood,
in admiration of the angelic manner in which she treated
and attended to the bodies and souls of Mr. Tucker's
house full of young gentlemen boarders, aided by her sedate,
wise, excellent, <HI>eldest</HI> daughter, her beautiful lovely second
daughter, then too young for any thing but to be universally
admired and beloved, which she continues to be in an eminent
degree by all who have the pleasure of knowing her; and
what is above all, by her throughly polite accomplished
husband, Mr. Symonds, a gentleman of large fortune in
Leicestershire. Long may she be spared to him and his
children.</P>
<P><PB N="cclxiii" REF="275"/>
The Editor regrets that she has trespassed so long on the
patience of the Reader. Having delivered her sentiments
freely on Gratitude and Ingratitude, it would be unpar∣donable
in her to close this long Preface, without acknow∣ledging
the great obligations she feels that she lies under
to several amiable friends of her excellent Son, and of her
unworthy self, not for any the smallest assistance in scrawling
these undigested immethodical pages. It would be injus∣tice,
it would be more, it would be cruelty, to let it be
suspected, that any literary friend, learned male or culti∣vated
female, had the smallest share in this poor per∣formance.
The Editor is at present too far removed from
the press; and, franking being, alas! almost annihilated, she
has not had it in her power even to consult a friend capa∣ble
of directing or advising her, one only excepted, who
was <HI>too tenderly</HI> affected at hearing half a dozen lines <HI>redde,</HI>
however excellently qualified to direct, advise, or correct
any <HI>hobbling</HI> sentence.</P>
<P>The Editor's Son used often to regret that his Mother
would not write Poetry, saying, <Q REND="inline">"he was very sure she
<HI>could</HI> if she <HI>would,</HI>"</Q> as did a poetical friend of her youth,
whose name often appears in Dodsley's Collection of Poems.
Had either lived to see how lamentably she acquits herself
in Prose, it had saved her some persecution. Both were
more angry at her repeated declarations that she did not
love Poetry, very rarely redde it, excepting Dr. Young's
<PB N="cclxiv" REF="276"/>
Night Thoughts and some parts of Milton, &amp;c. The poetry
of De la Crusca must charm a savage.</P>
<P>In Mr. Monck Berkeley's benevolent vindication, in the
Author's Preface to the Poems, he exhorts people to re∣member
that the Reviewers are but MEN. If those Gen∣tlemen
condescend to review a few pages written by a fe∣minine
pen, the Editor wishes them to remember, that
she is a <HI>Woman,</HI> a suffering OLD <HI>Woman,</HI> with most of the
accomplishments at threescore that most females have at
<Q REND="inline">"the age of man,"</Q> ten years later—that she served an ap∣prenticeship
to <HI>extreme</HI> anxiety and anguish for very near
seven years—seeing daily the declining state of health of
the two nearest and dearest connections in life, obliged to
<HI>affect</HI> ease, and often cheerfulness, whilst her heart bled at
every vein. Unfortunately for her, both Father and Son,
through their lives, declared, that if the Editor's constant,
even cheerfulness, never high, never low, failed, both
would give themselves up to absolute despair. The strong
exertions necessary to act the part to <HI>their</HI> satisfaction
have certainly brought on a premature old age; and the
Editor, according to the witty, wise, pious, Bishop
Taylor, <Q REND="inline">"is quite ready-dressed for the grave,"</Q> whither
she seems hasting apace. The Bishop, in his "Holy
Dying," says, <Q REND="inline">"dim eyes, gray hairs, stiff joints,"</Q> &amp;c.
&amp;c. are all so many <Q REND="inline">"<HI>dressings</HI> for the grave."</Q> He does
not add dulled faculties; <HI>I</HI> am sure he might, although
<PB N="cclxv" REF="277"/>
perhaps, HE might not feel it; his own wit being <HI>too well</HI>
tempered to have the keenness of its edge blunted by aught
but death itself. That is the lot of but very few. Per∣haps
the great Mr. Burke may escape it, who yet, ten
years ago, complained of his tongue and his fingers. They
have, however, enabled him to hold his pen to bestow
<HI>heavy,</HI> although <HI>very just,</HI> chastisement where it was meet
and right to do it. Long may he wield it, a terror, one
should hope, to <Q REND="inline">"all who offend through MALICIOUS
WICKEDNESS,"</Q> to whom the Psalmist, speaking by the
Holy Spirit, beseeches God the Father NOT to be merciful.</P>
<P>To attempt doing justice to the goodness of Friends
(some now no longer inhabitants of earth), to Mr. Berke∣ley's,
or to his Parent's gratitude, would require a ream of
paper, now, like most other things, become a very dear
commodity. Through the course of this work, written by
hasty snatches, sometimes laid by for many months un∣touched,
so as to have occasioned much disagreeable tauto∣logy,
the copy was never transcribed; so that it was sent
rough to the press; and much gratitude is due to the
Printer, for his patience in decyphering all the interlinea∣tions
in it, without the aid of the worthy Sir Francis Willes—the same person and the same action brought twice on
the <HI>tapis</HI> when once would have done—but much fault has
been found with the author of "Anecdotes of the two last
and present Centuries," for not relating every thing at
<PB N="cclxvi" REF="278"/>
the same time of many of the personages; perhaps they
might not come to the author's knowledge until the first
part was printed off, as many things have occurred to the
now treacherous memory of the Editor after it was too late
to insert them in their proper place. She has therefore
taken leave to insert them in a less proper one; for which
she thinks she ought rather to beg her own pardon for being
such a fool as to insert the mat all, than the Reader's,
for inserting, perhaps at page 7, what, if method had been
attended to, ought to have been placed at page 2.</P>
<P>The amiable, generous kindness of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
relations at Eton, the Reverend John Hayes, now eldest
son of James Hayes, Esquire, of Holyport, and the laborious
endeavours of his brother Charles, both several years older
than Mr. Berkeley, of course being excellent scholars, much
higher in the school, to <HI>make</HI> his little kinsman as studious
as himself, have been noticed above, as also the partiality
of his beloved respected tutor, the learned Dr. Norbury,
and the kindness of Dr. Langford whilst in the lower school,
who yet once offended him most highly.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley finding fault one holyday that he was not
advanced in Greek as he ought to have been, he indig∣nantly
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! I wonder I am not worse; but I am
sure I shall be well improved by the next holydays."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cclxvii" REF="279"/>Dr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"How so, child?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, I will tell you the truth. At <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> such
a time, so many of us were to give in an exercise;
and when Dr. L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> had redde them all over, he said,
Berkeley, yours is a very much better exercise than Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s;" (naming a nobleman's son, who, with that
elegant wisdom which has ever marked Eton school, and
rendered the youths, even the little boys, the best bred
polite beings one can see, whilst some other great schools,
as a very learned, accomplished man, always used to say,
are a set of savages, a nest of hornets, are always styled
Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> the sons of private gentlemen without that
very proper distinction.) "Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s exercise is not
<HI>near</HI> so good as yours; but <HI>he</HI> shall gain the place, because
his is as good an one as he is capable of writing, and
yours is not your best by any means. Good as it is, <HI>I</HI>
know, and you know, you could have made it a great
deal better; therefore <HI>he</HI> shall have the place. On this
declaration, I was so exceedingly angry, that I resolved
not to learn a word of Greek for six months. The time
is just now expired, and so I shall set to it again."</Q>—Dr.
Berkeley exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child, how could you
be such a fool?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I cannot help it, Sir, I was angry,
and <HI>I made a vow,</HI> and <HI>I resolved</HI> to keep it, come what
would."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was, as has been shewn before,
steady as a rock.—Later in life he made a more important
<PB N="cclxviii" REF="280"/>
vow. One night at Brooks's he and his learned beloved
Eton St. Andrew's friend, the learned T. Hobhouse,
Esquire, were drawn in to play deeper than Mr. Berkeley,
at least, ought to have done. The amiable, worthy Mr.
Hobhouse has a very good maternal estate. Mr. Berkeley,
as is usual, won a frightfully large sum, soon lost it again,
and all the money in his purse, and much more than he
had at his chambers to pay it. Very providentially Mrs.
Frinsham happened to be in town. Early the next morning
he posted off to Duke Street. Mrs. Frinsham, somewhat
surprized at hearing from her servant that Mr. Berkeley was
come before nine o'clock, went out to him; the case was
related, and that generous friend instantly enabled him to
discharge his <HI>first,</HI> his <HI>last, gaming</HI> debt; telling him,
<Q REND="inline">"that she never felt such pleasure arising from having
money at command."</Q> She has, in her youth, often re∣lieved
so very largely, as to deny herself for months the
elegant necessaries of young ladies, to accommodate a
particular friend, or an old acquaintance. Mr. Berkeley
going down soon after to his father's, on the evening of
his arrival, asked his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"If she had heard what a
<HI>fool</HI> her son had been;"</Q> to which she replying, <Q REND="inline">"That
she did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool
by any one, but his <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> now and then;"</Q>
he related the above-mentioned circumstance, adding,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, you may set <HI>your heart at rest</HI> from any
fear of your Son's ever becoming a gamester; <HI>for, as soon</HI>
<PB N="cclxix" REF="281"/>
<HI>as</HI> I got home to the Temple, I kneeled down, and be∣sought
God to cast out my prayer if EVER I again played
for any sum more than I could well afford to lose, play∣ing
now and then with one's neighbours in the country
on a winter evening."</Q> It has, I believe, been mentioned
above, that Mr. Berkeley, whenever he did play, which
was very seldom, and a very indifferent whist-player he
was, almost constantly won.—All his winnings went to
relieve the poor.</P>
<P>But to return: Dr. Berkeley told his son that Dr.
L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> acted highly right, and that he should have
esteemed it rather a compliment than a punishment. To
which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, NO, Sir, not if you had ever been
at school, and knew <HI>what</HI> it was to lose a place. He
said aloud, 'That mine was by much the best exercise;'
and he <HI>ought,</HI> therefore, in <HI>justice,</HI> to have given <HI>me</HI>
the place."</Q> Mr. Berkeley was then a child: he thought
differently of the matter a few years afterwards.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley certainly did not inherit his wonderful
daring resoluteness either from his amiable Father, or from
his Mother; but, probably, as well as his fine figure, from
his Mother's father, whom the Editor has frequently heard
relate the following fact concerning himself: <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frin∣sham
lost his beautiful mother at twenty-four, just when
he was five years old."</Q> (His father lived a widower
<PB N="cclxx" REF="282"/>
near fifty years). Some time before her death, the
servant went into the room where they were at breakfast,
saying, that <Q REND="inline">"Master would not eat his mess for breakfast,
but wanted coffee, <HI>like</HI> his Mamma."</Q>—Up sprang his Father,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will give him coffee!</HI>"</Q> went and gave him a good
whipping—still the mess was refused—a second whipping,
with no better success—at length a third, when his mother
called out, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Frinsham, let him alone, if he won't eat
it now, he will eat it when he is hungry, don't whip him
any more."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I will whip him till <HI>to-morrow morning</HI> if
he does not eat it before."</Q> The Editor has frequently
heard her father say, <Q REND="inline">"that he had resolved to endure se∣ven
or eight flagellations;"</Q> but the declaration, <Q REND="inline">"that
they should be continued until the next morning"</Q>
determined him to eat it immediately, which he ac∣cordingly
did, always observing, how wise it was to
break children of stubbornness in their infancy. It pro∣bably
eradicated it in Mr. Frinsham; for a sweeter tem∣pered
child never lived, as the Editor has frequently heard
a worthy woman declare, who went to keep his father's
house, on the death of his Mother—she lived to near
ninety, and always made an annual visit at Mr. and after
his death at Mrs. Frinsham's—that <Q REND="inline">"he was the most amia∣ble
of children, and of youths."</Q> When Mr. Frinsham
sent his sons to Oxford, this careful servant went to take
care of another, and a third set of poor motherless children;
by which means, and the little bounties of her adopted
<PB N="cclxxi" REF="283"/>
children, she obtained sufficient to maintain her more than
decently, genteely. She was ever a parlour guest in all
the gentlemen's families whom she had brought up. She
had by her father, in very early youth, been married to a
gentleman who deserted her, and went to live abroad; she
was therefore a <HI>safe</HI> housekeeper for young widowers. Her
first service was Mr. Frinsham's Father's. The Editor has
frequently, since she grew up, heard her say, <Q REND="inline">"that her
mother, going to visit her soon after she went thither,
addressed her thus: 'My dear child, this is a very heavy
charge that you have taken upon yourself. If you do not
take the utmost care, the <HI>same</HI> care of these beautiful
little children (Mr. Frinsham's younger brother was a re∣markably
handsome man), never expect my blessing, but
my curse shall surely light upon you."</Q> Poor Mrs. Grove
used to say, <Q REND="inline">"I felt horror at the thoughts of my mother's
curse."</Q></P>
<P>It was mentioned above, that a desperate ague obliged
Mrs. Berkeley to resign the task of nursing her son to ano∣ther.
The person who a few years before had nursed
Charles Hayes, Esquire, now Fellow of King's College,
was by his dear tenderly beloved mother, of whose amia∣ble
sweetness to the rich, and godlike charity and com∣passion
to <HI>all</HI> the surrounding poor, the Editor often
thinks, sometimes talks, with extatic delight, when she
reflects, that she is gone to Him who inspired, and is
<PB N="cclxxii" REF="284"/>
<HI>now</HI> rewarding those lovely tempers. May her sons,
when they <HI>venture</HI> to marry, meet with ladies as amiable,
as worthy, as their lovely mother; as sensible as their
great grand-mother, not famed for sweet temper, the
Editor's great aunt, eldest daughter of William Cherry,
Esquire, as a reward for their kind care of their little kins∣man
at Eton.—The Editor says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>venture;</HI>"</Q> marriage was
always a lottery, <HI>never</HI> resembling Mr. Pitt's—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>not two
blanks to a prize,</HI>"</Q>—but where there are not two prizes to
two hundred WORSE than BLANKS. How can <HI>ill</HI> educated
girls make <HI>good</HI> wives? But men must thank their <HI>own</HI>
folly.—This lady was as beautiful as she was lovely, ex∣ceedingly
resembling a very fine original picture of Anne
Boleyn, in the collection of an hereditary friend of the
Editor's, the late James Warren, Esquire, great uncle of
the brave worthy Sir John Borlase Warren<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This brave excellent officer some few years ago met with, it is hoped, a singular instance of ingratitude. That more than nineteen out of twenty voters at Great Marlow, Bucks, know A from B, is owing to the noble charity school, founded by the ancestors of Sir John Borlase Warren, who resided at his feat at Little Marlow, and laid out much money with them; and a very few years ago, these worse than <HI>sea</HI> monsters ousted him of his seat in parliament for Marlow. Sir John Borlase Warren, with proper spirit, the spirit of his very antient fa∣mily, sold his great estate in Bucks, and removed from that county one of its most antient respectable families. Had the Editor time, she would relate a very curious anecdote of the <HI>great</HI> gratitude of Sir John Borlase Warren's great-grand∣sire, who married the rich heiress of Sir John Borlase, and which has been repeatedly related to her by his Son, the above named James Warren, Esquire.</NOTE>. Mr. Warren
<PB N="cclxxiii" REF="285"/>
meeting Mrs. Hayes sometimes at the Editor's Mother's
house, always termed her <HI>Cousin Anne.</HI></P>
<P>Judge Hayes used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"that his son Charles
and Dr. Berkeley's both owed their bold intrepid spirits
to their nurse, the most courageous of females, having
once nearly killed a young man, who attempted to take
some improper liberties with her, when she could hardly
be styled a woman."</Q> Mr. Charles Hayes and Mr. Monck
Berkeley were very generous to her when they grew up.
Mr. Hayes always admired the wonderful genius of Mr.
Berkeley, who sometimes passed the short holydays of
Whitsuntide at Holyport, with his kind kinsmen. The Judge
one day exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, I never saw such a creature in
my life as Berkeley. I am persuaded, that if I were
to say I am in distress how to get five hundred pounds
conveyed to the Lord Mayor of York, Berkeley would
instantly start up, and say, 'Dear Sir, give me leave to
go and carry it for you;' not feeling any impropriety at
the idea of a boy, of just then thirteen, being so em∣ployed;
and, what is more, I am sure, if he undertook
it, he would execute it as well at thirteen as any man of
three and twenty. He is a most wonderful being."</Q> In∣deed
his bright genius shone forth in a splendid manner to
the last breath he drew.</P>
<P><PB N="cclxxiv" REF="286"/>
Mr. Berkeley ever retained a grateful sense of kind invi∣tations
from friends at Windsor—the late Lady Colerance;
his Mother's near relation, the amiable excellent Mrs.
Chessyre; the Lady of his Mother's old <HI>very intimate</HI> friend,
the late agreeable Dr. Bostock, Canon of Windsor; and
his relation good Mrs. Hayes, and the very worthy Mr.
Trevanian.</P>
<P>Any attempt to enumerate and descant on, as they me∣rit,
the innumerable, amiable, respectful attentions paid to
Mr. Berkeley, even by strangers, to every thing but his

would fill almost as many pages as the learned accomplished
Mr. Malone has filled in defending his favourite, the im∣mortal
Shakspeare. Had Mr. Monck Berkeley been living,
it had doubtless roused the ire of that young Poet; but
Mr. Malone needs no coadjutor in any business that worthy
gentleman takes in hand.</P>
<P>The Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh did Mr. Berkeley
the honour to elect him a member, when he was only
nineteen years old, an honour perhaps never before con∣firmed
on one so very young, on his sending them a most
excellent account of a very curious quarry in the heart of
the Highlands. Mr. Berkeley had the honour to have the
freedom of Aberdeen, and some other cities, and of many
<PB N="cclxxv" REF="287"/>
towns, presented to him. He constantly delivered them
to his Mother, requesting her to take great care of
them.</P>
<P>How would Mr. Berkeley's spirit have been roused, had
he lived to hear the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The throughly brave are never cruel. There are few who have not heard the bravery of Lord Balcarras at Saratoga, under General Burgoyne. His Lordship's gun <HI>did,</HI> his coat still <HI>does,</HI> remain, no doubt, at Balcarras, a proof of it.—The Editor thinks she mentioned it in the St. James's Chronicle; she has not now time to turn to the paper. She has been told, when indignantly reprobating the charge, that it was occasioned by ENVY.—The Holy Scripture asks, <Q REND="inline">"Who can stand before ENVY?"</Q> Not even the amiable, worthy Lord Balcarras—how much less then the little insignificant Editor, who has, alas! suffered sorely from that <HI>odious</HI> passion, that, to her, <HI>unnatural</HI> disease of the mind. Having, thank God, never felt it, she conceived herself too unimpor∣tant in the scale of beings to have exited it.</NOTE>gentle, pleasing, mild, Lord

His <HI>able</HI> pen would instantly have been employed
in vindicating his noble, respected, beloved friend. The
feeble one of the Editor ventures to assert, that a few
years must have wrought a <HI>wonderful</HI> change in that
very amiable gentle nobleman, if it is not as probable
that he would horsewhip his lovely-hearted Countess,
(as did the late horrid Colonel D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> his lady, aided
by his still more horrid footman,) or of guillotining his
beautiful sister, the Countess of Hardwicke. Those who
have had the pleasure of living four years in his Lordship's
<PB N="cclxxvi" REF="288"/>
neighbourhood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Once, when Mr. Monck Berkeley was gone to spend some happy days at Balcarras, it occurred to Lord Balcarras that Mr. Berkeley had never slept in old NOLL's bed, still standing in that beautiful mansion (always styled by the Editor <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>Scotch Cliefden</HI>"</Q>—there is great similarity in the situation, &amp;c.) and he declared he should sleep in it.—To which Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Not unless I have your Lordship's sword by my bed-side; for the old <HI>villain,</HI> know∣ing how much I detested him, will <HI>certainly</HI> visit me <HI>before midnight.</HI>"</Q>—It was not very likely Mr. Berkeley should have been retired before that hour, from such agreeable company. At another time, when Mr. Berkeley was staying at Balcarras, a very agreeable, sensible relation of Lord Balcarras being more than a little <HI>fou</HI> (the elegant Scotch word for our ugly word <HI>drunk</HI>) there was much difficulty in conveying him to his chamber. When arrived there, all retired but Lord Balcarras and Mr. Monck Berkeley—whilst they were cajoling him to let them undress him, he prayed very earnestly to God; they smiled at his re∣peatedly asking them, <Q REND="inline">"What must become of his <HI>beautiful</HI> soul?"</Q> At length Lord Balcarras said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Berkeley, how devout <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> is, <HI>now</HI> that he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OU."</Q> This gentleman, <HI>not famed</HI> for devotion, had received a very pious education, and was <HI>always devout</HI> when dr<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>k, if not too far gone.</NOTE> could as readily believe that the sun shone
at midnight to light these hunters.</P>
<P>To the introduction of his friend, Mr. Lennard, Mr.
Berkeley was indebted for the happiness of enjoying an in∣timate
friendship with the excellent Sir J. Clarke of Penny∣Cuicke,
and his charming Lady, daughter of Mr. Dacre of
the North, to whom Mr. Lennard was related. He ad∣mired
their amiable virtues, and revered their goodness.
And invitation, whenever he was in Edinburgh, and had no
<HI>more agreeable</HI> engagement, to visit that excellent pair, it
was impossible should ever be obliterated from the memory
<PB N="cclxxvii" REF="289"/>
of Mr. Berkeiey, or his greateful Parents. The goodness of
their very agreeable worthy countryman, Commissioner
Wharton, and the excellent Lady Sophia, to Dr., Mrs.,
and Mr. Monck Berkeley, on their first arrival in Edin∣burgh,
to whom they were introduced by the worthy he∣reditary
friends of Mrs. Berkeley, Mrs. Edlins, daughters of
the excellent Baron Edlin, whose pious Lady and daugh∣ters,
remarkably bountiful to the poor, are still the subject
of admiration and praise in Edinburgh, are still dwelt on
with unfeigned gratitude and delight. Happy the poor
who reside near the few still surviving ladies of that worthy
family.</P>
<P>When at St. Andrew's in Scotland, Mr. Monck Berkeley
used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, it is a mercy that I am not <HI>quite so
much</HI> in love with Lady Elizabeth Lindsey as my Mother
is. If I was, I must run away with her; not, as <HI>we</HI> say, to
Scotland, but to England; and that would be a <HI>fine</HI>
story."</Q> The lovely, polite, <HI>unaffected,</HI> sweet, <HI>real,</HI> gen∣tleness
of that lovely Lady, are doubtless the source of much
domestic felicity to her Lord. Her Ladyship is, the Edi∣tor
verily believes, or nothing should cause her to write it,
one of the <HI>very</HI> few <HI>genuine</HI> gentle spirits scattered here and
there to be admired, and (alas! for poor unlucky simple
men) to be <HI>counterfeited.</HI> Dr. Berkeley used always to say,
there was nothing he disliked so much as <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a mighty pretty
sort of young woman.</HI>"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"that
<PB N="cclxxviii" REF="290"/>
she hoped nobody would ever style her such, when
<HI>he</HI> was present."</Q> He used to say, <Q REND="inline">"that he detested
insipidity."</Q> Such as she was, he had her <Q REND="inline">"<HI>for better
for worse</HI>"</Q> thirty-four years. One of those horrid horse
leeches, ever draining her too too generous husband,
having since his death told her, at her lawyer's cham∣bers,
<Q REND="inline">"That Dr. Berkeley married <HI>her</HI> for her money."</Q>
Wonderful assertion! as Mrs. Berkeley's fortune was only
a few odd thousands; and when he was urged to take a
lady, much in love with him, who had <HI>more</HI> than a hun∣dred
thousand pounds. The Editor feels herself obliged,
after this WONDERFUL assertion from a low-lived Divine,
who, educated by John Wesley, perhaps never <HI>saw</HI> any
University until at Dr. Berkeley's expence, to say, that
Dr. Berkeley has repeatedly declared to his son, in
her presence, <Q REND="inline">"Have not I told you, over and over, that
had I been Duke of Norfolk, or Robinson Crusoe, your
Mother is the woman in the whole world that I would
have chosen for a wife;"</Q> adding what it is impossible for
the Editor to write; <Q REND="inline">"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and she could and would make
matters comfortable, pleasant on that island;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I
have always told you, I believe your Mother has the best
temper to live with for happiness of any person in the
world."</Q> Not many weeks before his lamented death he
said to several persons, friends, and servants, <Q REND="inline">"She is the
<PB N="cclxxix" REF="291"/>
best wife in the world."</Q> God knows that she feels, ever
did feel, how far she fell short, in most relations of life, of
the resolutions she made very early in life, to labour, if
ever she did marry, to make the best wife in the world,
and, if God <HI>blessed</HI> her with children, the best mother.
Alas! she repeats it, she <HI>feels,</HI> that she fell short; and yet,
such is the frailty of our fallen nature, that, were the time
to be gone over again, she fears she could not much mend
her hand. As mistress of a family, she, from early youth,
resolved to treat her servants just as she would wish them
to treat her, were they instantly to exchange stations. Per∣haps
this has sometimes gone rather too far. A beloved
friend of her's, nicknamed by the Editor in her youth, the
Centurioness, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I say to my servant do this, and he doth it,</HI>"</Q>
frequently told the Editor, she was a most incompara∣ble
governess of her children, and of dogs and cats; but
that her servants did, or did <HI>not</HI> obey her orders, <HI>just</HI> as it
suited their own convenience; adding, <Q REND="inline">"I think they are
mighty good kind of people to do any thing; you ask them
so quietly, Pray now <HI>will</HI> you do so?"</Q></P>
<P>The Editor, as above shewn, with her children did not
deal in shewing authority; with servants as well as children,
when she set about any thing in good earnest, calmly say∣ing,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will have this or that done.</HI>"</Q> She has ever, with
both, found that <HI>her</HI> word was a law. Servants are much
to be pitied; they have often jobs to finish as well as their
<PB N="cclxxx" REF="292"/>
superiors; it is grievous to a generous mind to drag them
away when half an hour later may do just as well. The
Editor, perhaps, is weak, ill-judging, in that, as in many
other things. She had been married more than seven
years, when her amiable Partner, a little warm, as the
Honourable Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> says <Q REND="inline">"<HI>ALL men are,</HI>"</Q> (<HI>they</HI> cer∣tainly
are LORDS of the creation, and how much is warmth
of temper to be preferred to <HI>sullenness!</HI>) came up into
her dressing room, saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Do</HI> go down stairs, and <HI>try,
once in your life,</HI> if it is <HI>possible</HI> for you to find fault with
a servant or not. Richard has done <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>" (or has not
done <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>")</Q> the Editor does not recollect which. This
worthy man was sometimes a little slow in his motions;
his master was very quick in his. His surname was Hyde.
He was related, and as many gentlemen learned in the
law supposed, heir to a vast unclaimed property in the
funds, left by a General Hyde, who died in the reign of
George the First. If it were duly considered by masters and
mistresses of families, that they and their domestics must
one day, ere long, stand <HI>together,</HI> at the same RIGHTEOUS
bar, they would surely prepare to answer, when asked, if
they had taken care to instruct them in their duty to their
Master in Heaven, or spent the time that might have been
so employed, in reproaching them for neglecting their duty
to their Master on earth. These governors of families
will be asked, <Q REND="inline">"Did you not allow them time to read
<PB N="cclxxxi" REF="293"/>some portion in the Book of God every day? If so, why
did you not, at stated hours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">God says, <Q REND="inline">"Shall I hide this thing that I do from Abraham"</Q>—seeing that I <HI>know</HI> he will COMMAND (not gently civilly ask them)—<HI>but</HI> <Q REND="inline">"COMMAND his children and his household,"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>, compel them to assemble
together, and hear it redde in your own presence."</Q> Then,
whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
<Q REND="inline">"Thou, Master, or Mistress, hast delivered thine OWN
soul,"</Q> as speaks Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Where there is no learning, little logic, little time, the
faculties of the mind and body both debilitated by ill-health
brought on by severe afflictions, as in the Editor's case. The
word <HI>severe</HI> ought to be expunged, if another could be substi∣tuted:
it must be <HI>heavy;</HI> for nothing can, ought, at least, to
be termed <HI>severe,</HI> that is inflicted in love by our heavenly
Father, on, alas! a lamentably ungrateful child, whose heart
is, however, perpetually quoting, from the inspired Prophet,
<Q REND="inline">"Wherefore should a man complain, a <HI>living</HI> man for the
punishment of his sins?"</Q> By which the Editor, for very
many years past, has conceived the Holy Spirit meant to
imply, by a <HI>living</HI> man, any one on this side the grave.
any one who is out of hell; for if, through Grace, MERCY
is at the <HI>latest</HI> period sought, it will <HI>infallibly</HI> be found,
witness the Thief on the Cross; and a <HI>modern</HI> Thief—alas!
no; poor wretch, he was <HI>only</HI> a murderer; for he had not
the heart to rob when he beheld the blood he had shed; con∣verted,
<PB N="cclxxxii" REF="294"/>
brought to Christ, not, alas! by one of those who rush
into the priestly office<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor heard some time ago, when the wretched Mrs. Reed, now Mrs. Edgar, was in Gloster gaol, that the Chaplain is a worthy Divine.—The Editor always regrets, when using an Irish Common Prayer Book, given her by her beloved Partner, that the very fine office for prisoners is not bound up with our even commonest, cheapest books of Common Prayer. The very fine prayer for those under sentence of death might, being redde by the children of the poor, at least keep them from the gallows. A few years ago a fine youth at one of the great schools was so charmed with it, that he requested the Irish youth where it was, to exchange with him for a very superb English Common Prayer Book. His father was a pious, although very eminent Barrister. The large Irish Prayer Book of Bishop Berkeley was, after his death, presented by his son to the gaol of Oxford.</NOTE>, that they may remain idle and igno∣rant,
or that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>they may eat a morsel of bread</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the First Book of Samuel.</NOTE>."</Q> This was
effected by that brave excellent officer, General Rooke, who
kindly, amiably offered the very old friend of the Editor,
the sensible, pious T. Hughes, Esquire, when a few years
ago high sheriff for Glocestershire, to rise at four in the
morning, in March, to accompany him on his dreary jour∣ney
of sixteen miles to attend the execution. He felt the
unpleasant dreary journey Mr. Hughes must have, and
amiably offered to accompany him. His sweet nature was
shocked, on their arrival at Gloster, at seeing the poor
wretch quite hardened, that he begged Mr. Hughes's
permission to talk to the poor creature a little; to which
the pious, amiable Mr. Hughes, who related the happy
tale to Dr. Berkeley, and repeatedly to the Editor, re∣piled,
<PB N="cclxxxiii" REF="295"/>
<Q REND="inline">"My permission, dear Sir, aye, and my best
prayers for your success."</Q> The execution was de∣layed;
and the blessed General, to whom the Editor re∣grets
that she has not the honour, the happiness to be
known, succeeded, so effectually succeeded, that a poor
creature, who at seven in the morning said, <Q REND="inline">"he had ne∣ver
heard of the <HI>Saviour of Sinners,</HI>"</Q> expired at noon be∣lieving
in him with all his heart, asking, <Q REND="inline">"And will HE
save such a WRETCH as I have been?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"rejoicing with
joy unspeakable and full of glory"</Q>—to the great com∣fort
of the Jury, as the High Sheriff told Dr. Berkeley; for
he had constantly denied the murder, and, the man being
not robbed, they were uneasy at having found him guilty.
The preceding and succeeding context might be here with
propriety inserted; they may be sought, and the whole
chapter redde with advantage by those who have never
murdered a man. The Editor, however, feels herself
obliged to vindicate herself from the <HI>bare</HI> suspicion of
Antinomianism by quoting No. XLIV. of "The Deep
Things of God." Though a child of God glories in
this, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>where sin hath abounded, grace doth much more
abound;</HI>"</Q> yet no child of God can <Q REND="inline">"sin that grace may
abound."</Q></P>
<P>On this one of the selected numbers being redde to Mr.
Monck Berkeley by his Mother, he exclaimed, with an
earnestness hardly to be described, <Q REND="inline">"God forbid! Oh!
<PB N="cclxxxiv" REF="296"/>
God forbid!!!"</Q> It was mentioned before, that the Edi∣tor,
constantly, on quitting her Son's chamber, wrote un∣der
every number his comments, ejaculations, &amp;c. upon it.
She most carefully selected what she felt suited the <HI>then</HI>
state of the soul.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley did not want instruction in his duty to God
or his neighbour. He did not want to be awakened, to be
shewn how direfully he had broken the <Q REND="inline">"Holy Law of
God,"</Q> nor to be made sensible of the penalty to be in∣flicted
for such breach; but to be convinced that Christ
had received him, which his deep humility prevented
him from believing, although the <HI>hope</HI> of it was his <HI>sole</HI>
support.</P>
<P>One night, when he supposed himself expiring at Dover,
Mr. Berkeley desired his friend, Mrs. Frinsham, might be
called out of bed to him: he said, <Q REND="inline">"I beseech you to pray
for me. You see me going, perhaps from misery here
to everlasting misery;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I yet feel some hope,
that God hears my Mother's prayers, and that Christ
will not quite cast me off."</Q></P>
<P>It ought to have been mentioned in its proper place,
that Mr. Berkeley wrote to his Mother from Oxford, de∣siring
her to summon all her <HI>fortitude</HI> to her aid, and pre∣pare
her mind not to be shocked at seeing the <HI>shadow</HI> of
<PB N="cclxxxv" REF="297"/>
what was <HI>once</HI> her Son. The original idea was, that of
Mr. Berkeley's going to Gloucester to be constantly under
the eye of Dr. Chestern. He therefore wrote, requesting
his friends to meet him on the road; accordingly, the mi∣nute
the post arrived, they, accompanied by their incom∣parable
friend, Mrs. D. Monck, set out and reached the
inn at Burford about five in the afternoon, and about
seven Mr. Berkeley arrived, attended by his own servant,
and a youth of about eighteen, the son of an old Irish
friend of Dr. Berkeley's, then staying with Dr. Berkeley,
who had been dispatched to meet Mr. Berkeley, who had
done amiably, as he ever did, to warn his Mother not to
be shocked, &amp;c. It required ALL her fortitude to see her
idol with difficulty get out of the chaise, and enter the
room, supported, rather <HI>difficultly</HI> supported, by his servant,
a man about his own stature.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley had gone to town to visit her Son, and
dear, excellent Mr. Grimston, whose goodness caused his
remaining in town all the summer with Mr. Berkeley, un∣til
August, when they set off for Hastings. Five months
of almost unabated torture had wonderfully weakened Mr.
Berkeley's <Q REND="inline">"<HI>earthly tabernacle.</HI>"</Q> Dr. Berkeley's great weak∣ness
apologized for his appearing dispirited; and Mrs.
Berkeley forced herself to appear not to feel supreme an∣guish
of mind at the sight of her IDOL thus debilitated.</P>
<P><PB N="cclxxxvi" REF="298"/>
Dr. Berkeley, rising about ten o'clock, said to his
Son, <Q REND="inline">"My dear child, I am so weak, and so wearied,
that I must wish you a good night; I am quite unable
to sit up any longer."</Q> Mr. Berkeley, begging his
Father's benediction, wished him a good night, as he did
his excellent friend Mrs. Monck. On his Mother's going
to shake hands with him and retire, he said, <Q REND="inline">"Best of Mo∣thers,
you have not been ill, like my poor Father: <HI>you
can</HI> sit up, and I greatly want a little conversation with
you."</Q> The above mentioned youth was of course making
his bow, when Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"You need not retire,
Sir; <HI>I rather wish you to stay;</HI>"</Q> when Mr. Berkeley thus
commenced, <Q REND="inline">"I am probably now not far from the end of
my course; and I wish to say some things to my dear
Mother; to bless her for having forced me to be regular
and constant in my attendance at public worship and at
family prayer, long before I felt or saw the necessity of
it myself, I am convinced, well convinced, that it is the
<HI>only</HI> way to train up a child, and, as my Mother, has
quoted a thousand times to us, (taking in his little bro∣ther,)
so convinced am I of it, that, of which there is
very little probability now, should I live ever to have a
family of children, or servants, I will force them to at∣tend,
I will drive them before me to the house of God,
and to family prayers."</Q> The young man stared to hear
the energy with which Mr. Berkeley uttered this sentence;
<PB N="cclxxxvii" REF="299"/>
he turned round, and, looking stedfastly at him, said, <Q REND="inline">"Yes,
Sir, so convinced am I of the wisdom of it, that if I
could get them no other way, I would <HI>kick</HI> them before
me, (driving out his foot with amazing strength;) it is
the <HI>only</HI> way to make them wise unto salvation in their
youth."</Q></P>
<P>It is has been before observed, that Mr. Berkeley
said, <Q REND="inline">"I have some little consolation in thinking, that
if all I ever printed, and all I ever wrote, lay on
the table, and a standish by me, and I knew that I
had but half an hour to live, I would not erase one
word of it; for, from a boy, I always resolved never
to write
<Q>"A line which, dying, I would wish to blot.</Q></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In all I have ever published or written, I have laboured
to render vice odious and ridiculous, and to hold up vir∣tue
to respect and admiration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Monck Berkeley, from a boy, had it strongly inculcated on his mind, never, through life, to ridicule those who minister in things sacred, even in a false religion; his Mother constantly saying to him, <Q REND="inline">"If ever you travel in Turkey, or India, or amongst the Hottentots, always pay respect to the priests of the country, however erroneous or absurd their religion may be; for, without <HI>some</HI> sort of reverence for the Supreme Being, man degenerates, so lamentably, as to become WORSE <HI>than the beasts that perish.</HI>"</Q> How strictly Mr. Berkeley attended to this admonition may be plainly seen in "The Generous Rustic, or Spanish Memories," and above all in his last excellent legendary tale of Heloise in "The Siege of Rhodes;" with the last edition of which is joined the "Vicar's Tale," originally published in the Oxford Olla Podrida. The village there described, is the beautiful village of Witeringham in Northumberland, of which the agreeable worthy Mr. Twentyman was many years curate. Mr. Monck Berkeley, one day speaking with extacy of the wit contained in Fielding's writings; his Mother said, <Q REND="inline">"Hold your tongue. If you talk of the wit, I will talk of the wickedness of them."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my Mother, they abound with wit and humour."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well, <HI>my dear Sir,</HI> will you be <HI>pleased</HI> to tell me <HI>what</HI> sum would bribe you to have written Joseph Andrews, and Tom Jones; in each of which the clerical character is held up to supreme contempt in the person of <HI>Parson Adams</HI> and <HI>Thwackham</HI>—reli∣gion in youth wounded through the odious Blyfieldt—he game-keeper's wife, a <HI>Parson's daughter,</HI> proclaimed an harlot by her own harlot daughter—no opportunity omitted of disgracing the clergy and their poor starving families."</Q> A <HI>mourne silence</HI> ensued; but his Mother continuing her harangue,
he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why I should not have chosen to have written just those parts."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Sir, <HI>I know</HI> that the riches of <HI>both</HI> the Indies would not have bribed you to do it. THANK GOD, therefore!"</Q></NOTE>. But, alas! what is that?
<PB N="cclxxxviii" REF="300"/>
How have I fallen! God help me! and how often have
I envived my dog as he lay sleeping by my bedside,
and said, 'Ah! thou dear happy brute, God will not
call THEE into judgement, as he will thy <HI>wretched</HI>
master."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley quoted many gracious promises from Holy
Scripture, and the promise of promises, <Q REND="inline">"Him that cometh
unto me I will in no wise cast out;"</Q> but all this was in
some degree in vain. It was reserved for her excellent
<PB N="cclxxxix" REF="301"/>
friend, Sir Richard Hill, by his incomparable book<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor conceived that she had before mentioned Mr. Berkeley's de∣light in a little book of Sir Richard Hill's, intituled, "A Present for your Neighbour;" without which he had never travelled for several years before his death, always taking it in his trunk; but, not finding it on carefully reading over the printed sheets, she mentions it here. Returning early one day from hunting, and it happening to rain, he entered the house through the servants' hall, where this little book lay open in the window. The title caught his quick eye. The servants all dispersed to their different occupations. He took it up, and went to his room. Some time after he came into the Editor's dressing-room, holding a little book in his hand, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, my dear Madam, how came you not to give your Son one of these books, as well as your house-maid?"</Q> The Editor answered in the same way, <Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Sir, because I did not think that my <HI>Son</HI> wanted it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"You were much mistaken: <HI>he</HI> wants it very much; and <HI>I desire</HI> you will be pleased to give him one directly,"</Q> nodding to that end of the large book-case where he knew the books for the poor were kept. Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, I cannot; for I gave away the last three days ago."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Very well, my dear Mother, I am sure you will get a freight down soon, for I am certain you won't be <HI>long</HI> without <HI>such</HI> books as this; so I shall keep this in <HI>pawn</HI> till you redeem it. I know you are a very honest lady, and won't cheat your house-maid."</Q> Mr. Berkeley used to divert his Father, by saying, <Q REND="inline">"I believe my Mother is the honestest woman living, where my Aunt and I are not concerned (being in haste to pay every one else) if she borrows of us, it seems to sit <HI>quite easy</HI> on her <HI>conscience.</HI> She certainly thinks it no fin to cheat us of a guinea now and then."</Q></NOTE> above
named, to pour the balm of perfect peace—that peace of
God which passeth ALL understanding—into the dear,
humble, contrite, troubled spirit of her unspeakably dear
Son—that peace for which the generality pray at least
once a week, but which so very few labour to obtain; when
obtained, they feel that <Q REND="inline">"the yoke of Christ is easy, and
his burden light."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccxc" REF="302"/>
It was near two o'clock in the morning, before Mr.
Berkeley, apologizing to his Mother, told her that he would
detain her no longer, fearing that the want of a good night's
rest might injure her health. Mr. Berkeley always knew
that the loss of sleep is almost death to his Mother, whose
Mother and Sister could, and the dear survivor can, pass
weeks in health, with scarce any sleep at all. Mrs. Berke∣ley
in that, as in other things, resembles her Father.—When
young, her Mother used to tell the Editor, that
she thought she <HI>could</HI> not be <HI>her</HI> child, because she used
to wish to leave a ball-room at four o'clock—her Mother
telling her often that she used to stay till <HI>eight,</HI> then drive
home several miles, exchange her ball-dress for her morning
one, and not go to rest till twelve next night, or rather
morning; for her mother, Mrs. Cherry, never retired to
her chamber till twelve, and constantly rose, winter and
summer, at six, until within two years of her death, at
sixty-eight, when she rose not until seven o'clock. It was
little likely that Mrs. Berkeley should enjoy much sleep
after so interesting a conversation of four hours.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley is said, by all those who have known her
most intimately from her childhood, to be of the most
hopeful temper they ever knew: she preserves with tenderest
care a hair ring given by her dear Son; an elegant figure of
Hope leaning on her anchor, one hand pointing up to
<PB N="ccxci" REF="303"/>
heaven, with this motto in hair, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Heaven's best gift to
man.</HI>"</Q> It is very certain, that until she saw her Son the
day after his happy spirit had quitted his fine form she
did flatter herself, that the mercy of God would spare him
to her; under the idea of having laboured from her youth
to obey, oblige, delight her own excellent Mother, in
order to make her feel less poignantly the loss of an al∣most
adoring husband, that God would vouchsafe to reward
her in KIND, and spare her Son. But, alas! her Son was
her idol; and idols must be given up. The Editor was
supposed to be idolized by <HI>her</HI> Mother, of whom it used
to be said, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs. Frinsham loves her so much, that she
never lets her walk across the room without looking at
her (little insignificant figure) with pleasure in her eyes."</Q>
That delight must have arisen from thinking she bore some
resemblance to her excellent Father. The Editor has the
pleasure to reflect that there was nothing she would not
have sacrificed to please the best of Mothers, and that she
always prayed to God that he would be pleased to spare her
life, if it were only for <HI>one week</HI> beyond her Mother's, that she
might be spared the affliction of seeing her go before her. The
Editor felt that she was the cause of much sad anxiety to her
Mother, not having had the small pox, as her excellent sister
had when a child, at Mrs. Sheeles's school, and its being la∣mentably
fatal in Mrs. Frinsham's family, her eldest sister
being one Saturday esteemed the most beautiful creature in
<PB N="ccxcii" REF="304"/>
London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The beaux of that day bestowed the following subriques on the three co∣heiresses of Mr. Cherry, all beauties. The eldest above mentioned, the Duke Cherry, fit for a Duke; the second, the fine Black Cherry, from her dark hair, her complexion lovely; the third, Mrs. Frinsham, the finest figure of the three, was termed the Heart Cherry. She proved her right to that pleasing subrique, by rejecting, for the sake of the Editor's father with a small fortune, but un∣common worth, numbers of brilliant splendid matches. Her ideas on that head descended to her daughter and her grandson. It is a little remarkable that there was a very strong resemblance in the faces of Dr. Berkeley and Mrs. Frin∣sham, so as to strike Dr. Berkeley himself the first time he saw her pictures. Neither of her daughters resembled her in the smallest degree, either in her ex∣quisitely fine tall figure, which used to occasion her being followed in the Park, Mall, &amp;c. where young ladies exhibited in those days, and which she retained to the last, as well as her fine red and white, and the exquisite sweetness of coun∣tenance, the distinguishing temper of her soul, as well as of the Editor's angelic delightful friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot, of Lambeth Palace. These two lovely ladies' pictures hung near each other in Dr. Berkeley's eating-room. It is probable such kindred spirits are united in the realms of bliss.</NOTE>, and the next the most deplorable object, mor∣tified
all over, and much blacker than an Ethiop. In the
latter part the Editor has no doubt but she had resembled her
lovely Aunt, had she not been inoculated by Mr. Sutton
himself, who attended her at her own house at Acton,
with great assiduity, Dr. Berkeley being then rector of
that parish. They were sensible of the blessing of such a
Preacher. Multitudes came every Sunday to Acton church,
to hear one who, according to St. Paul, did not, as, he
observed to the Editor in his last illness, <Q REND="inline">"preach himself,
BUT CHRIST JESUS THE LORD;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"HE knows I
<PB N="ccxciii" REF="305"/>
preached him in SINCERITY, always dreading to be a
popular preacher, a pleaser of the people."</Q></P>
<P>The following observations are intended solely to benefit
some few unfortunate families where the small pox is worse
than the plague. Mrs. Berkeley having not long weaned
her second son, and duly prepared by Mr. Sutton, her
friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her
what, by the blessing of God, it is to thousands, to mil∣lions,
not to herself; <HI>she</HI> conceived, if she escaped with
life, that would be all; but the sufferings, her not having
had that frightful disease <HI>had</HI> occasioned to her Mother,
<HI>did</HI> constantly occasion to an almost adoring Husband, and
the tenderest of Sisters, determined her one way or other to
deliver them from their incessant anxiety; accordingly she,
together with Mr. Monck Berkeley, then between four and
five years old, were both inoculated on the same day,
with the same matter. The latter had only three pustules,
and did not lose half an hour's play through indisposition.
His Mother had but few in her face, those on her nose
pitted to the bone, a vast number on her head, a fright∣ful
quantity in her throat, and several on her arms, fingers,
and feet; all shewed their malignity by being confluent,
and not turning until three and twenty days—a plain
proof, but for Mr. Sutton's method of treating the small
pox, she had shared the fate of her beautiful aunt Miss
Cherry. Mr. Sutton asserted to Dr. Berkeley and others,
<PB N="ccxiv" REF="306"/>
Mrs. Berkeley's friends, that he had never before had such
a patient. He was much alarmed, and exceedingly atten∣tive,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"that had Mrs. Berkeley caught the small
pox in the natural way, she would have mortified in a
few days; that had Mr. Monck Berkeley caught it in the
natural way, it had probably never have been known that
he had had it."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's mother, Mrs. Frinsham,
had only ten pustules, when a child about eight years old.
A singular symptom attended Mrs. Berkeley's small pox,
that of her eyes being, for more than three days, set in
their sockets, so fixed that she could not move them at
all, could only see in an absolutely straight direction; yet
she had not one pustule in her eyes, or on her eye-lids;
it was quite internal.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley had been at first at Sutton House; but,
having always a wonderful partiality for her own home,
which she conceives would be the case if her home was a
neat clean barn, begged Mr. Sutton's permission to return
to her own house, with which he very obligingly complied,
on condition of her going to him when he could not call
on her, which she punctually did, her horses having no∣thing
else to do, but drag her then wretched frame to take
the air, as directed, half a dozen times in the day, she be∣ing
unable to walk. Mrs. Berkeley, in her visits to Sutton
House, used to enquire of the sensible well-bred Reverend
Mr. Houlton, chaplain to Mr. Sutton, when her eyes would
<PB N="ccxcv" REF="307"/>
be better? his constant answer was, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear Madam,
you will be in heaven to morrow, I assure you."</Q> The
next day Mrs. Berkeley, on entering the drawing-room,
enquired of her fellow patients where Mr. Houlton was, that
she might tell him, <Q REND="inline">"She did not like HIS, Mr. HOULTON's,
heaven at all."</Q> The very witty Canon Bowles, of Salis∣bury,
being one of the patients, opened the door, and
called out, <Q REND="inline">"Houlton, come down; her is Mrs. Berkeley,
the lady of a Divine, that declares she does not even <HI>wish</HI>
to go to heaven;—come down, man, and talk to the
poor lady."</Q></P>
<P>A lady, whose name is not at present remembered by
the Editor, came down one morning, looking much dis∣tressed,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"I am very ill indeed."</Q> She sent for the
sensible, clever, <HI>consoling</HI> housekeeper, and exhibited her
chest covered over with a most tremendous erysipelas. The
housekeeper said, <Q REND="inline">"Do not fear, Madam; if it please God,
you will get safe through;"</Q> the lady, turning to Mrs.
Berkeley, said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>If I do,</HI> I shall be the <HI>first</HI> of my family
that ever did."</Q> It did please Providence to bring
her safely through, and spare her to a most anxious
husband, who visited her with trembling tenderness per∣petually.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley suffered much from the kind persecutions
of Dr. Berkeley and her Sister, to suffer Sir William Duncan
<PB N="ccxcvi" REF="308"/>
and Dr. Addington <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Addington used frequently to tell the Editor, that the first fee he ever received was at the house of Mr. Frinsham. A gentleman on a visit there was taken suddenly ill; Dr. Hayes was his physician, but Dr. Addington hap∣penned to dine at White Waltham; he prescribed; and, as he said, got his handsel in Berks. He got a better treasure in Berks than gold, than rubies, the best and most sensible of wives, one of what the Editor always styles HOUSE BUILDERS. See the Proverbs of Solomon, chap. xxxi. Not <HI>Castle,</HI> but <HI>House</HI> Builders, are real treasures to sons and daughters. This M.D. narrowly escaped one of the weakest, and obtained one of the wisest of women.</NOTE> to be sent for; which Mrs. Berkeley
resolutely opposed, fearing it might injure the cause of in∣oculation,
the greatest blessing surely that ever was granted
to the terrestrial part of man. Mrs. Berkeley resolved to
live or die, as it should please the all-wise Disposer of all
events, by Mr. Sutton alone. Being at that time a little in
the world, and a little known, she conceived, that calling
in regular medical aid would easily be turned into, <Q REND="inline">"Mrs.
George Berkeley would <HI>certainly</HI> have <HI>died by Sutton's me∣thod,</HI>
if so and so had not saved her life."</Q> Mr. Sutton
felt himself so obliged by her conduct, that he, at different
times, inoculated poor people <HI>gratis,</HI> whom she recom∣mended
to him, obligingly telling her, <Q REND="inline">"One line from her
at any time, sent by a poor person, should be sufficient
introduction to his care and his kitchen."</Q></P>
<P>It is the fashion with persons of a certain description
to disbelieve what they cannot comprehend, and to laugh
at what they do not understand, and many persons ex∣plode
<PB N="ccxcvii" REF="309"/>
the idea of the small pox generally proving fatal in
some families.</P>
<P>Several years after, one night, at a large rout at Canter∣bury,
there was universal lamentation over a family, who
had lost a darling child by inoculation in the common
way. Mrs. Berkeley naturally said, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! poor people!
why did they not let Sutton attend it? <HI>He is the man,</HI>
where it proves so fatal in families."</Q> A Canterbury phy∣sician,
not remarkable for his worth, now no more, mean∣ing
to turn Mrs. Berkeley to ridicule, said, <Q REND="inline">"And so, Ma∣dam,
you believe the doctrine of the small pox proving
more fatal in some families than in others;"</Q> and pro∣ceeded
to harangue, at a wonderful rate, against the absur∣dity
of that doctrine, when, amongst other ladies and gen∣tlemen,
approached the elegant Mrs. P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> t, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"Surely, Dr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, Mrs. Berkeley is right, at least she
thinks exactly as Baron Dimsdale does; for, when he
inoculated my daughter, he expressed his astonishment
that a little creature so healthy, with so fine a com∣plexion,
should have it so much more severely than was
the case with inoculation in his method with one in five
hundred."</Q> Mrs. P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> t told him, <Q REND="inline">"She could assign
no reason for it, unless it could be admitted as one, that
her father (the worthy Dr. D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Prebendary of
Canterbury,) died of it, a desperate sort."</Q> To which,
she said, the Baron replied, <Q REND="inline">"You have fully accounted
<PB N="ccxcviii" REF="310"/>
for it, Madam. In the few patients I have had, who
have suffered much with it, I have always found that
some of their families, on one side, have, for generations,
died of it."</Q> The Editor knows one family, where, for
above two centuries, not one attacked by that tremendous
disease ever did recover, until the introduction of inocu∣lation;
and in such unhappy families their children should
be carefully kept out of the reach of infection, until old
enough to take remedies to prevent being choaked, as it
usually attacks the throat, and infants cannot take reme∣dies
to ward off that frightful attack; as was the case with
the Editor, her throat being <HI>quite lined</HI> with pustules.</P>
<P>We have an high authority for knowing, <Q REND="inline">"He that wa∣tereth,
shall himself also be watered again."</Q> Mr. Berke∣ley
experienced it, at least, in one very pleasing instance,
his introduction to his noble, highly-honoured, respected
friends, their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Marl∣borough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had Mr. Berkeley been living, how sincerely, how tenderly, would he have sympathized with that illustrious pair on their late loss. The Editor re∣joices that their Graces have still two sons (although she had none), a very amiable young nobleman, and a very fine youth, who, by having his late, learned, accomplished brother held up as a pattern, may be stimulated to re∣semble him. Before Mr. Monck Berkeley considered his health as irrecoverable. He one day said to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"If God spares my life until next summer, I mean to step abroad, and visit my friend Lord Henry Spencer."</Q> The Edi∣tor does not recollect where his Lordship then was. Mrs. Berkeley's constant, advice to her Son was, whilst persons of high rank or station treat you as a gen∣tleman, a man of family, although <HI>untitled,</HI> always remember that they are <HI>your</HI> superiors; but, the instant they forget, have nothing more to do with them. Mr. Monck Berkeley never would visit, or meet, notwithstanding all her Lady∣ship's <HI>submissions,</HI> a poor silly Peeress, his near relation, who, having a <HI>very</HI> short memory, had <HI>quite</HI> forgot her kinsman, until she learned in town, that it was <HI>ton</HI> to be acquainted with Mr. Monck Berkeley. So much for the present of her Ladyship's WISDOM. When the Marquis of Blandford went to Eton, the then Dean of Canterbury, who went down with him, desired Mr. Monck Berkeley, about two or three years older, to take his Lordship under his pro∣tection, <HI>i.e.</HI> as the Editor conceives, to see that they are not <HI>too</HI> much buffeted by their own or an higher form; a certain <HI>quantum</HI> is excellent for—the Editor had almost said Kings; however, <HI>certainly</HI> for <Q REND="inline">"Lords and Commons."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, having known this, and his Son's telling him that the Marquis of Blandford was at Christ Church, on Mr. Monck Berkeley's first return from Oxford to the Oaks, said, <Q REND="inline">"I suppose Lord Blandford had quite forgot you; it is so long since you left Eton, (near seven years.)</Q> Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my dear Sir, you are mistaken; being engaged to dine one day at the noblemen's table at Christ Church, and seeing Lord Blandford come into the hall, I determined to wait, thinking he might <HI>really</HI> might have forgotten me; but the instant his eye caught me, he sprang forward, and took me by the hand, saying, 'My dear Berkeley, how do you do? I am happy to see you."</Q> This young nobleman has, as Mr. Berkeley always said he had, a very amiable heart. Every one at the time, near thirty years ago, heard the rencontre of the then very sensible, polite, agreeable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Master in Chancery.</NOTE> Master P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s with Lord. B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, after his return from his travels, and his congratulating his Lordship on being a man, as he was a boy, of sense, at Eton.</NOTE>, for which he was solely indebted to his very
<PB N="ccxcix" REF="311"/>
old friend, the Reverend Dr. King, now Chancellor of
Lincoln. Mr. Berkeley happened to be at his father's,
when Dr. King was appointed to Dr. Tanner's vacant
stall in the church of Canterbury. Immediately on
hearing it, he, with his wonted sweetness, when asking
a favour of either of his parents, said to his Father,
<PB N="ccc" REF="312"/>
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Sir, I should take it as a very great favour
if you would have the goodness to invite Dr. King to
be your guest when he comes down hither to be in∣stalled;
as I believe, although a most excellent scholar,
he is entirely ignorant of all matters of this kind, and
you are <HI>au fait</HI> in them. He was exceedingly kind and
good to me when I was at Eton, and when we used to
go over together to Lord Inchiquin's," (that elegant no∣bleman,
one of the friends of Dr. Berkeley's very early
youth at Cloyne, most amiably kind to Mr. Berkeley when
at Eton,) "and to Sir Adam Gordon's," (a very old friend
equally kind,) "and it would delight me to have it in my
power to shew my gratitude to him."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley desired his Son to write immediately to
Dr. King, and say, <Q REND="inline">"that, although he, Mr. Berkeley,
must probably be absent, Dr. Berkeley requested the
favour of his company."</Q> Accordingly, at the proper
time, Dr. King arrived at Dr. Berkeley's house in the
Oaks, accompanied by his sensible brother, John King<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The present worthy high-bailiff of Westminster.</NOTE>,
Esquire. Dr. King expressed his sense of the little attentions
it was in Mrs. Berkeley's power to shew him, more highly
than they merited. She requested him, if it was in his power,
to do her Son the honour to introduce him at Blenheim;
Mrs. Berkeley, having ever, from a young woman, be∣fore
<PB N="ccci" REF="313"/>
she married, declared, if ever she had a son, she would
try to introduce him to that noble family, in preference to
<HI>any</HI> other in England. His Grace's father, the late Duke,
was very uncommonly amiable, and had much worth.</P>
<P>The Editor cannot avoid dropping a tear over the too early
grave of a most amiable young gentleman, who accompa∣nied
Dr. King in his second visit to Dr. Berkeley's, his bro∣ther-in-law,
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Manby, Esquire, secretary to the
Duke of Leeds. Any attempt to do justice to the amiable,
mild, gentle, elegant merits of this young gentleman,
would require an inspired pen, instead of one dulled,
blunted, by age and affliction. Probably all who knew
him would be ready, with the Editor, to take up the lan∣guage
of Shakspeare, and say,<Q><L>"I ne'er shall look upon his like again."</L></Q></P>
<P>Good Dr. King, more learned than attentive, had brought
Mr. Manby down with him to the Summer audit; and,
knowing that Dr. Berkeley's house was not very large, had
deposited him at one of the wretched inns at Canterbury.
After being at the Oaks two days, one morning at break∣fast,
the good little Doctor said, <Q REND="inline">"He must go before he
went into the audit room, and see after <HI>his</HI> young man."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley, knowing that the Doctor had no son, en∣quired,
<Q REND="inline">"What young man?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccii" REF="314"/>Dr. King.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Why, why,</HI> he is Mrs. King's brother; I
brought him down to <HI>see</HI> Canterbury."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Where is he?"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. K.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, at one of your inns down in the city."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Who is with him?"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. K.—<Q REND="inline">"Why nobody; that is the thing!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"How old is he? A man grown up, or a
youth? Surely it is not <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At Eton at the same time with Mr. Monck Berkeley; now Deputy High Bailiff of Westminster—a very polite young gentleman, as polite as an Irishman—for he is amiably attentive to <HI>aged matrons</HI> and <HI>dowagers,</HI> to prevent their breaking their bones, when in dangerous situations.</P>
<P>Prob. The Editor some years ago at Dover.</P></NOTE>dear Dick, after whom I heard my Son enquire of you so kindly, and
charge you so strictly to give his affectionate regards?"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. K.—<Q REND="inline">"No, no; he is older than Dick; it is his eldest
brother."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, who shews him the <HI>lions</HI> of Canter∣bury?"</Q></P>
<P>Dr. K.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, poor fellow, nobody: <HI>that</HI> is the <HI>thing.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>The</HI> THING <HI>indeed!!!</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>It will, by this time, be easily perceived by those who
have the pleasure of knowing <HI>intimately</HI> the learned Doctor,
<PB N="ccciii" REF="315"/>
that Mrs. Berkeley had taken upon herself the government
of this <HI>little</HI> great man; Mrs. Berkeley always asserting,
that although we are forbidden by the Apostle to govern
our <HI>own</HI> husbands, <HI>that</HI> prohibition <HI>does not</HI> extend to our
neighbour; and Mrs. Berkeley is, by her friends, esteemed
a pretty good hand in that, often <HI>very necessary</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor sometimes reflects with pleasure, that through her instrumen∣tality <HI>more</HI> than <HI>one</HI> couple of her married friends have acknowledged, that, by her advice, always delivered in the humblest, the most secret manner, they live in good harmony, before unknown. When any of the Editor's friends marry, she always writes them a letter of advice, mixed with congratulations; if she has leisure, it is a full sheet. A gentleman, some time ago, wrote her word, that he carefully preserved her letter, and frequently redde it over, and meant to do so as long as he lived. He has been very happily married.</NOTE> business.
But, to quit this <HI>folaterie,</HI> which the Editor brought into
the world with her, and which, <HI>maugre</HI> all her afflictions,
her present exceedingly indifferent health, seldom well a
whole hour together in a week, she seems to feel will
never quit her, like the excellent Sir Thomas More's
wit, and good old Lady Banister's humour, who, dying
at an hundred and nobody knows how many more
years old, told all her great grand-children, <Q REND="inline">"not to
stand crying over her, for that they could not think
that she was dying an <HI>untimely</HI> death, in the <HI>prime</HI> of
life."</Q></P>
<P>The dear lively Bishop of Norwich, one day, at dinner
at Dr. Berkeley's, said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, how came you
<PB N="ccciv" REF="316"/>
to let my brother King go to church this morning with∣out
a band?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Mr. Dean, if you did
but know the <HI>trouble</HI> it costs <HI>me</HI> every day, to prevent
his keeping your Eminences (a title bestowed by Mrs.
Berkeley many years before on the Dean and Prebenda∣ries)
waiting dinner for him, you would pity me; all
<HI>my</HI> eloquence <HI>cannot</HI> inspire <HI>him</HI> with <HI>due</HI> veneration for
the collected body—the CONCLAVE."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, feeling the unpleasantness of Mr. Manby's
situation, besought Dr. King to bring him to Dr. Berkeley's.
Mrs. Berkeley, her Son being in London, sent immediately
to a very amiable worthy young man, who felt great grati∣tude
for some very <HI>essential</HI> services rendered him by Mrs.
Berkeley, repaying his attentions, when a boy, to her little
boys, much younger, at the King's School, the worthy
Mr. William Jackson, son of the Collector of Excise, and
afterwards an Alderman of Canterbury. This grateful,
well-informed young man died, after a very few days illness,
universally lamented, as he was universally beloved and re∣spected.
His wonderfully low-lived parents gave rings of
his hair, set with diamonds, to many of the ladies of Can∣terbury,
who would not have known that he existed, as
himself used to say, but for Mrs. Berkeley's gratitude; which
when he, at nineteen, quitted the King's School, led her
to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the
younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs. Mrs. Berkeley
<PB N="cccv" REF="317"/>
introduced him to her learned friend the Reverend John
Duncombe and his Lady, and requested them, when she
left Canterbury, in 1777, to take to him. His mind re∣ceived
much cultivation from that learned, worthy, well-in∣formed
pair. To Mrs. Berkeley the old woman sent
into <HI>Berkshire,</HI> Mrs. Berkeley being there at the time of his
death, a piece of catgut worked with her son's hair, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"that Mrs. Berkeley did not <HI>want</HI> diamonds."</Q> Poor
young man, he often, when living, felt her low absurdi∣ties,
when she <HI>insisted</HI> on exhibiting to her son's company.
He repeatedly said to numbers of people, <Q REND="inline">"But for Mrs.
Berkeley's goodness, and I had been in such a set,"</Q>
(naming several aldermen's sons, &amp;c.) some now vio∣lent
Democrats, who were kept in their own line of
company, whilst Jackson was in the first company in the
church and county. His father, at his death, left legacies
to all his son's friends, excepting to Mrs. Duncombe and
to Mrs. Berkeley, to neither of whom an hundred guineas
for a ring would have been unacceptable. But the new
Legacy Bill will never affect Mrs. Berkeley; for, as Mrs.
Frinsham says, when any of her rich relations die childless,
<Q REND="inline">"Sister, to be sure they forget that you and I exist, or
that we know how to <HI>spend</HI> a little money, for none of
them ever name us even for a ten guinea ring."</Q></P>
<P>But, quitting this subject for a much pleasanter, Jackson
immediately presented himself in Mrs. Berkeley's dressing∣room,
<PB N="cccvi" REF="318"/>
when she introduced him to Mr. Manby, requesting
him to become his guide, to conduct him to every thing
worthy notice in the church or city, to repair to the Oaks
every morning at breakfast, and every day at three to take
their dinner with Mrs. Berkeley, and spend the afternoon;
the Prebendaries dining together at each other's houses,
during the audit, the tables generally being full; and taking
their tea in the audit-room.</P>
<P>On the day when they dined at Dr. Berkeley's,
on Mrs. Berkeley's entering the eating-room, the dinner
served, the Bishop of Norwich, then Dean, going up to
her, presented her with a pamphlet, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Madam,
entirely in obedience to your commands, there is the
sermon that I preached on Trinity Sunday. If it pro∣duces
any good, it is entirely owing to you, for it has been
often preached, and never was intended for the press.
but you insisted upon its being published; and I have
obeyed your orders."</Q> Many of the Prebendaries said,
the public were very much indebted to Mrs. Berkeley.
The Bishop, when sitting at dinner, said, <Q REND="inline">"I must request
you, my dear Madam, to give me a list of your friends
whom you wish should read it, that I may send it to my
bookseller."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley felt, as it merited, this very
polite attention from her most excellent old friend, and
said, <Q REND="inline">"She would request a few to send to some of her
friends in Scotland; that her English friends could pro∣vide
<PB N="cccvii" REF="319"/>
themselves:"</Q> then said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I must pull this incompara∣ble
discourse all to pieces;</HI> and get some of my pocket
M.P.'s;" (so Mrs. Berkeley always styled two amiable
Baronets, who used at all times to convey her simple chit∣chat
to her friends;)</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I do wish to convey one <HI>en∣tire</HI>
to dear Lord Leven. What method can I take, my
dear Mr. Dean? Can you advise me?"</Q> Sweet Mr. Man∣by,
with pleasure in his eyes, replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam,
<HI>I</HI> can render you that little service, and shall be most un∣feignedly
happy to do it. You know we can send any
thing from the Secretary of State's Office."</Q></P>
<P>When the audit was ended, and the good little Doctor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The next time Mrs. Berkeley saw her Son, after his good friend, Dr. King's visit at the Oaks, he enquired, <Q REND="inline">"how she liked his old friend?"</Q> She replied, as all <HI>will</HI> reply who know him intimately, at the same time asking Mr. Monck Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"What is Mrs. King like?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Like, my dear Madam, why, like a QUEEN. YOU never saw such a woman, I promise you, in <HI>your</HI> whole life."</Q> Those who have seen Mrs. King will be apt to think that Mr. Berkeley had improved in his knowledge of beauty, since his dear friend Miss M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> used to style a very plain woman one of Berkeley's beauties. Mr. Berkeley was <HI>then</HI> only seventeen, and ever such an admirer of a superior un∣derstanding that, provided he heard wisdom, he regarded not the mouth.</NOTE>
and his brother going to quit Canterbury, this most amia∣ble
of young gentlemen thus addressed Mrs. Berkeley:
<Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, what can I do? what can I say to
you, for your throughly polite attentions, for your won∣derful
goodness to me? I am utterly unable to express
<PB N="cccviii" REF="320"/>
in <HI>any</HI> degree, the sense I must ever retain of it. If at
<HI>any</HI> time, in <HI>any</HI> way, I can render you <HI>any</HI> service, you
will delight my spirit by only pointing it out to me."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley conjured him not to distress her, by saying
a syllable more to her, for having <HI>only</HI> done just what every
other person, not a savage, had they known his situation,
<HI>would</HI> have done.</P>
<P>The Editor cannot here forbear relating a little anecdote
of her Son's lovely amiability, of which she was only very
lately informed, he never having mentioned it. A lady,
who was a stranger, visiting at Mrs. Berkeley's, happened
to sit opposite the fine portrait of Mr. Berkeley, painted
by his amiable accomplished friend, Mr. Peters; she, in a
low voice, said to the lady who sat next to her, <Q REND="inline">"I never
saw so like a picture in my life."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, although
she cannot see, yet hears remarkably quick, (thanks to
God's blessing on the skill of Mr. Maull in Piccadilly, ex∣erted
about twenty years ago,) said, <Q REND="inline">"I did not know, Ma∣dam,
that my Son had the honour to be known to you."</Q>
To which the good old lady very politely replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ma∣dam,
<HI>I</HI> had the honour to be known to Mr. Berkeley. One
year returning from Margate, we wished to see the cathe∣dral
of Canterbury; we walked up, and could not see
any one to tell us where to find the person who showed it.
We saw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and
forwards by the side of the church. After some time one
<PB N="cccix" REF="321"/>
of them, detaching himself from the rest, came up to us,
and, in the politest manner, said, 'Ladies, are you in
any distress, in which I can assist you? The ladies told their
wish to see the cathedral, and their utter inability to find
out how to do it. Mr. Berkeley said, 'If you will have
the goodness to wait two minutes, I will get the verger
to attend you.' He stepped into a shop, sent off a lad
for the verger, and again joined the ladies. On the ar∣rival
of the verger, Mr. Berkeley escorted them into the
church, pointed out to them some particular beauties of
that glorious temple of God, charged the verger not to
omit shewing them some things as he named; then,
saying 'he had an engagement,' made an elegant bow,
wished them a pleasant journey, and took his leave."</Q>
The ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman
was to whose politeness they were so much indebted. He
replied, <Q REND="inline">"that it was Mr. Berkeley, son to one of the Pre∣bends."</Q>
The ladies expressing gratitude, the verger said,
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam, every body loves Mr. Berkeley exceedingly,
he is so kind and condescending to every one."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley both had been for some time
wishing to obtain for their worthy old servant, Mr. Wright∣son,
when he should marry and quit service, the place of
one of his Majesty's messengers, he having repeatedly flown,
with incredible velocity, over this kingdom, and to and
from Ireland, on Dr. Berkeley's business; and probably,
<PB N="cccx" REF="322"/>
had it not pleased the ALL-WISE Director of ALL things,
<HI>small</HI> as well as <HI>great,</HI> to remove to the society he so strongly
resembled on earth the angelic Mr. Manby, the poor of
Canterbury had not been blessed with quite so excellent,
so judicious, and so kind a governor, as successor to their
former very worthy master, Mr. Nott. It is surely a de∣light
to every feeling heart, to see the aged poor made
happy, the young instructed and brought up industriously,
the way to be happy here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The Editor is much addicted, wherever she resides or
stays, any little time at a place, to visit the <HI>work-houses,</HI>
feeling tender pity for those who have not a penny to buy
tobacco, snuff, or a little <HI>two</HI> shilling tea, and <HI>sweetened
sand,</HI> called sugar, to season it. Her feelings suffered much
whilst at Oxford; as she really conceives, from what she
<HI>herself</HI> saw. The relation of two of her old servants, whom
she frequently sent thither, that most well-regulated Bride∣wells
are Paradises compared to the Oxford Work-house;
in short, nothing out of the infernal regions can be worse,
or worse conducted. Mrs. Berkeley's maid, sent thither
one day to see after a poor sick woman, was obliged to
take shelter in a room some poor creature opened to her;
an audacious harlot flying through the house with a great
knife to murder the then poor, stupid, ignorant mistress.
They have no poundage from earnings: <HI>once</HI> in the year,
at the <HI>Races,</HI> they have, some two-pence, some six-pence,
<PB N="cccxi" REF="323"/>
given them, as one of the guardians told Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, to
<HI>figure away</HI> with on the Course.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, one day, on going out, gave a poor
woman, who had called the mistress to her, and shewn her
the <HI>uncultivated</HI> wretched garden, a shilling. The poor wo∣man's
gratitude and extacies were sorely distressing, adding,
<Q REND="inline">"I have not seen a shilling before for two years."</Q> This
poor creature had lived comfortably in London, her hus∣band
a mason, killed by the breaking of a scaffold, when
alas! she was wretched enough to belong to some parish in
Oxford. Mrs. Berkeley enquired whom among the guar∣dians
were tenderly disposed towards the poor, and was
told, Mr. Slatter the baker, and Mr. Ayton the grocer.
Mr. Slatter serving Dr. Berkeley's family with bread, she
instantly set off to call on him, and never recollects to have
seen a more sensible, well-behaved, humane person in
humble station; he would make a better figure in an higher,
than many who have scrambled up to it. He assured her,
that, unable to combat with the <HI>majority</HI> of the guardians
in defence of the poor, he had in despair relinquished it
entirely.</P>
<P>She then went to Mr. Ayton, and received a similar an∣swer.
She exhorted both, but, she fears, in vain. How∣ever
unpleasant it might be to continue to fight the battles
of the poor, she assured them there would come a time
<PB N="cccxii" REF="324"/>
when they would rejoice that they had done it. Their an∣swer
was, that the lowest and most mercenary of the trades∣men
were appointed guardians, and there was no opposing
them. How different from Canterbury! two most re∣spectable
tradesmen out of each of the sixteen parishes
are annually chosen; sometimes, she conceives, rechosen;
as, when she wished to get a poor creature going in com∣fortably
deposited, she constantly went to Dr. Berkeley's
baker, the very worthy, sensible well-bred Mr. Johnson,
educated at the university of Cambridge. On the death of
his father he most dutifully and affectionately went home,
to assist his worthy mother in carrying on her business.
Mr. Johnson, if not in office himself, constantly took care
to apply to some worthy man who was. The Editor is no
Democrat; feels horrors at the vile idea of Equality—but
such direful <HI>inequality</HI> as a rich <HI>bon-vivant</HI> Oxford tradesman—and the poor, almost poisoned poor creatures in that vile
workhouse, must hurt every heart who has ever redde in
the Bible, <Q REND="inline">"Who maketh thee to differ from an∣other?"</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>The Editor, after delivering her sentiments very freely
on one class of people in Oxford, cannot quit the place
without taking notice of a very different class, whom she
once had it in contemplation to address in the Oxford
Mercury, as she did not feel happy to quit Oxford without
offering her very grateful acknowledgements to them—the
<PB N="cccxiii" REF="325"/>
young gentlemen of the University. It is a general, an al∣most
universal complaint amongst the Fair Sex. The Edi∣tor
begs pardon for a misnomer; she ought to have written
the RED SEX; for almost all now resemble <HI>Rouge Dragon</HI>
in Heraldry; to be sure, the present dress makes them re∣sembles
Heraldic animals, and Swift's yahoos. The Edi∣tor,
famous amongst her friends for never wearing any cap
or hat that did not become her sort of face, nor any colour
that did not become her complexion, and was perpetually
consulted on that subject by her friends, cannot help think∣ing,
that the Father of Mischief has been the inventor of
the present mode of dressing, particularly the vile, scooped
out hats, or rather straw caps; she therefore styles them
<HI>Diabolls.</HI> It is no wonder that husbands go astray from
wives so odiously disfigured.</P>
<P>That all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at
an end, is a charge perhaps too well founded. An excel∣lent
exaltedly pious friend of the Editor's, but lately gone
to glory, the lady of the late very worthy amiable Thomas
Baber, Esquire, of Sunninghill Park, and who had the hap∣piness
to be the mother of Edward Baber, Esquire, well
known to all in the East for his <HI>inflexible</HI> honesty. He had
the happiness of throughly pious, as well as accomplished
parents. This lady, once a most celebrated beauty, used
to say, <Q REND="inline">"The young men of this day are quite Hottentots;
all I expect of them is, that, if I happen to fall down,
<PB N="cccxiv" REF="326"/>
they will be so good as to kick me aside, and not walk
over me."</Q> The Editor fears the charge may be too true;
but she feels it a duty incumbent on her to say, <Q REND="inline">"that if
politeness to females is banished from every other place,
it has taken up its residence amongst the <HI>young</HI> gentle∣men
of the university of Oxford—<HI>true</HI> politeness extending
ever to <HI>aged</HI> females."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor, as has been mentioned before, has at sixty
every accomplishment that some are without at eighty;
frequently, if walking alone, stepping into a <HI>grey</HI> puddle,
mistaking it for a nice clean broad stone. The polite at∣tentions
from young gentlemen in assisting her to cross
the street, sometimes accompanying her half a street's
length to direct her to a shop, opening the door for her,
always giving her the wall, not driving her off the pave∣ment,
as two officers did a few years ago at Newcastle,
she leaning on her husband's arm—he being dressed in a
short cassock, they supposed him a bishop, as they said <HI>en
passant,</HI> and knew <HI>(worthy wights!)</HI> he could not <HI>challenge</HI>
them, but he severely reproved their <HI>brutality.</HI> The Editor
happened to hear that the wife of one of them <HI>amply</HI> re∣venged
her quarrel. He almost deserved it.</P>
<P>The Editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity
of one gentleman, whose name, although she took much
pains to learn it, she never could find out, until the even∣ing
<PB N="cccxv" REF="327"/>
before she quitted Magdalene Lodge, at the close of
November 1795, or every grateful, respectful attention
would have been rendered to the Reverend Mr. Williams,
Sub-warden of Wadham College.</P>
<P>A Lady of fashion, well known in the polite circles, now
of an age, as well as the Editor, to dress for <HI>comfort,</HI> not
for shew, having an house in the neigbourhood of Oxford,
often walking in the street with the Editor, said, <Q REND="inline">"Your
remark is very just, that the young men here are <HI>certainly
very well-bred;</HI> if they were not, they would laugh at us—for, to be sure, you with your black beaver gypsey hat,
tied down and hiding half your little (politeness prevented
her adding, withered) face, and your rusty black cloak;
and <HI>I</HI> in my <HI>old</HI> hat and <HI>old</HI> great coat, are two curious
enough figures."</Q> The Editor's excellent relation and
herself are both old-fashioned, in making it a point to pay
their butcher and baker every Monday morning. And the
Editor used always to tell Dr. Berkeley, and her Son, when
she got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a
servant, that she did not like a footman attending her,
when she did not appear as if she could pay him his
wages.</P>
<P>The Editor never met with any impertinence, but twice,
during her <HI>sejour</HI> in Oxford.—One day walking by Baliol
College, a poor creature in <HI>(she supposes)</HI> a servitor's gown,
<PB N="cccxvi" REF="328"/>
expressing his dislike of her hat, and after she was passed,
said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>he would give a crown to know who she was,</HI>"</Q> the
Editor languished to have turned on her heel, and have
said, <Q REND="inline">"Young man, save your crown to buy Trusler's
edition of 'Lord Chesterfield's Advice to the amiable
Phil. Stanhope.'—I will tell you, without reward, that
I am the wife of Dr. Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury;"</Q>
but, having with her a lady who always returns pertness
by <HI>silent disdain</HI> (which affects not fools, it may wise persons)
the Editor's <HI>generosity</HI> in gratifying the poor low-lived crea∣tures
curiosity <HI>gratis</HI> would have hurt her dignity. The
other was, one very hot evening, the Editor had taken in
her hand a <HI>para-sol;</HI> a shower coming on, she held it over
her head, to protect a very good hat. Not far from Christ∣church
she met a number of gentlemen, pushing home from
the shower, who all passed her with their usual politeness,
stepping off the very narrow pavement, to avoid incom∣moding
her; the rear was brought up by a <HI>little</HI> insignificant
looking animal in a gown, who in a voice, resembling
any thing but that of a young man, squeaked out,
<Q REND="inline">"Look, look, here is a lady holding a <HI>para-sol</HI> over her
in this violent shower—what a fool she must be!!!"</Q>
The Editor heard two or three of the gentlemen say,
<Q REND="inline">"Not at all—it did not rain (she supposes they added)
when she set out."</Q> The name of this wise <HI>little miss,</HI>
in a black gown, is concealed in pity to his <HI>poor</HI> parents—it is enough to be <HI>burthened</HI> with <HI>such</HI> a poor little
<PB N="cccxvii" REF="329"/>
creature, without seeing him held up to public con∣tempt.</P>
<P>A very worthy friend of the Editor's, whom she has not
had the <HI>delight</HI> of seeing for many years, Mrs. M. Jeffries,
of Richmond, used formerly to say, <Q REND="inline">"One has <HI>no pleasure</HI>
in hearing scandal from Mrs. George Berkeley, for the
little d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l will never tell one the name, until all the
town rings with it."</Q> The exquisitely kind attentions of
this wonderfully agreeable, worthy lady, to the Editor's
angelic friend, the late Mrs. Catharine Talbot (when her
excellent friend, the Marchioness de Grey, lent her house
at Richmond to Mrs. Talbot), during her lingering illness,
must ever endear her to the Editor, although it is little
likely she should every see her again, until they meet in
the region of spirits, as both are much attached to their
own abode.</P>
<P>Quiting these two curious beings, the Servitor and
squeaking Miss, to thank themselves for these animadver∣sions,
the Editor returns her best thanks to all, and every
sensible polite young gentleman of the University. They
resemble, in some respects, holy Job, who says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eyes
was I to the blind, feet was I to the lame,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c. The
Editor sincerely hopes, that they may never be afflicted
as he was; and that those of her polite assisters, who choose
to marry, may meet with wiser and more pious wives than
<PB N="cccxviii" REF="330"/>
<HI>at first</HI> fell to the lot of, certainly a <HI>favourite</HI> of the
ALMIGHTY's; HE naming him one of the three with
Noah and Daniel, who should deliver their own souls.
This is mentioned to shew, to those who believe the in∣spiration
of Scripture, the folly of supposing the history of
Job a <HI>pious fable,</HI> and that holy man an <HI>ideal</HI> person. See
poor Dr. Durell's simple book; and, in all other respects,
the accomplished Mrs. Chapone's wise one, on this subject.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, the Editor has had the distress to
hear of the almost sudden death of a throughly amiable man,
who accidentally meeting her at tea at a neighbouring gen∣tleman's
house, and learning, not from the Editor, who is
not addicted to entertain her friends or visitors with lamen∣tations,
that she had much intricate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is impossible for her to omit offering her public acknowledgements to Mr. Wilberforce. <HI>The</HI> Mr. Wilberforce, the friend of all the distressed, whe∣ther their complexions are black or white, perhaps in this instance, might, with more propriety, be said <HI>brown.</HI> Having found it is impracticable to assist her in getting the Lords of the Treasury to remit the very heavy duty on the foreign books of Bishop Berkeley's library, removed from Ireland for sale in England, most generously wrote her a very polite letter, offering to lend her the money. He had never seen, or perhaps heard of her, until applied to, to use his interest with Mr. Pitt. It was most gratefully accepted, and will be most thankfully repaid. The Editor wishes she could get her income from Ire∣land, as easily as her Books (which, alas! have been so ill kept, that they have not defrayed the expence of carriage and duty. But, that many of them being wanted to complete sets in England, it had been wiser to have permitted the Irish worms to have finished them in their native country); the Custom-house Officers would not seize that. A widow in one kingdom, and her jointure in another, is rather unpleasant, is, sometimes, sorely distressing.</NOTE>, unpleasant business to
struggle through; visited her the next day, saying, <Q REND="inline">"he
<PB N="cccxix" REF="331"/>
was going to town in a few days. and if it was possible
for him to render her any service, in any way, he
should esteem himself very happy if she would, as he po∣litely
said, honour him with her commands."</Q> The Edi∣tor
accepted most gratefully his kind offer, and took leave
to employ him in a very fatiguing matter, in which his
amiability led him to be indefatigable. That it is not yet
accomplished, nor probably ever will, was not to be attri∣buted
to want of every exertion of the amiable Dr. Ser∣grove,
master of Pembroke College. This produced a de∣gree
of intimacy. Mrs. Berkeley, ever wishing, with little
ability, to benefit all her friends children, took the liberty
to recommend to his attention and protection, a very sen∣sible,
fine youth of his College, a son of the very worthy
Mr. Andrews, surgeon at Stanmore in Middlesex, one of
fourteen olive-branches to whom this throughly amia∣ble
hearted, benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and
kind, and told the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"that it had pleased him, and
he dared say would please her, that young Andrews had,
on Dr. Johnson's rooms becoming vacant, earnestly so∣licited
to have them assigned to him."</Q> Young Andrews
and his whole family, have as strong understandings as
Dr. Johnson. They are famed for it. May he make as
good use of it as did his predecessor in the rooms! This
agreable friend visited at Magdalene Lodge three days be∣fore
he went to town—to return, alas! no more—request∣ing
Mrs. Berkeley and Mrs. Frinsham earnestly to honour
<PB N="cccxx" REF="332"/>
him, as he politely termed it, by drinking tea, and spend∣ing
the evening at the Master's lodgings, saying, he would
invite some ladies, whom he named, the rector of Lincoln,
and some other sensible, agreable friends to meet them.
The very tender state of Mrs. Berkeley's health forced her
to decline it, which she now regrets. He promised to visit
Datchet; alas! may his obliged friend meet him in a <HI>still</HI>
pleasanter place.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, on her revisiting Oxford for a few days,
offered for the Reverend Mr. Williams's acceptance, and
which she hopes he received, one of the copies on royal
paper, gilt, &amp;c. (so decorated for some Lords Spiritual and
Temporal,) of Dr. Berkeley's famous <HI>long smothered</HI> sermon,
preached at Lambeth Palace Chapel, at the consecration of
his beloved old friend Bishop Horne, which she solemnly
promised Dr. Berkeley on his death bed, at his <HI>earnest</HI> in∣junction,
should be published.</P>
<P>The Editor, as perhaps she may have before mentioned,
never had any <HI>very great</HI> dread of the disapprobation of sin∣ful
mortals like herself; and, as she one day said to her
beloved partner, <Q REND="inline">"the removal of her dear Son had anni∣hilated
that little fear."</Q> If she can approve her conduct
to what Dr. Young, with his wonted energy, terms <Q REND="inline">"the
God within us, and to God in heaven;"</Q> she little re∣gards
the censures of any Prelates or Potentates on earth.
<PB N="cccxxi" REF="333"/>
This <HI>non chalance</HI> of the opinion of, what is called, the
WORLD, she by no means recommends to young persons
of either sex, or to mothers who have daughters that they
wish to marry off; <HI>tout au contraire,</HI> she dehorts them from
it. A proper respect for the <HI>then</HI> WORLD, she is persuaded,
did, in the last century, prevent some of our great-grand∣mothers
being exhibited at Doctors Commons, and before
the House of Peers. To be sure, <HI>they</HI> had also a <HI>little</HI> fear
of a <HI>great</HI> PERSONAGE, that our modern belles and beaux,
many of them, never even heard of from their wise, pru∣dent
parents.</P>
<P>The late excellent Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> once said to the Editor,
<Q REND="inline">"My father and mother were what the world called <HI>mighty
good sort of people;</HI> and yet I do declare, neither of
them ever mentioned any thing of religion to me, nor
ever even told me that I had a soul to be saved."</Q> Upon
the Editor's saying, <Q REND="inline">"they must have done it, but you have
forgotten it;"</Q> she reddened with anger, and answered,
<Q REND="inline">"No, no; <HI>you</HI> are the only human being that ever talked
to me on the subject of religion."</Q> Her father lived till
she was twenty-three, her mother until she had a grand∣child
of this daughter marriageable. The minister of her
father's parish was what the world termed a <HI>very good</HI> cler∣gyman;
probably he had not <HI>studied,</HI> he must have <HI>redde,</HI>
as it is a Sunday lesson, the thirty-third chapter of the pro∣phet
Ezekiel.</P>

The once gay (as vicious is too frequently termed) Lord
Holland, in his account of himself, written a little before his
execution, praises the wonderful mercy of God in the following
words: <Q REND="inline">"Oh! the astonishingly gracious mercy of God, that
<HI>I</HI> should owe my salvation to a child <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The incomparable angelically pious lovely Countess of Suffolk. This heavenly creature was, in mercy to her wretched Father's soul, snatched from the brink of the grave, just before his afflictions commenced. She attended him in prison every day; and, the night preceding his execution, sat up in an outer room, and entered with his gentleman in the morning. She was certainly spared from death temporal on purpose to rescue her father from death eternal. She went a very few months after to join her penitent parent in the realms of bliss.</NOTE> of my OWN—<HI>I</HI> who
have so sadly neglected the instruction of my children and

take care to have a <HI>good</HI> chaplain in the house to read

<P>The Editor, some years ago, returning from Scotland to
Canterbury, amused herself with visiting every nobleman's
house <HI>in</HI> her road, or that did not take her <HI>too far</HI> out of
her road, to view the fine pictures, &amp;c. She saw a chapel
at every one, and constantly said to the attending servant,

Madam, never."</Q> Here must be excepted the chapel at

the sensible obliging Mrs. Carr, the housekeeper: <Q REND="inline">"O yes,

now a <HI>Jew</HI> friend, and a most pleasing woman she is."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, but her name, my dear Sir. Who

and marry her; for, to be sure, she is <HI>rich,</HI> being a
<HI>Jewess.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Marry her; why, although the Levitical
Law allows of polygamy, much as you and I have both
studied it, I do not find that it allows the ladies to have
a plurality of husbands. That is only allowed to one
cast in the East Indies, where the woman is allowed <HI>four,</HI>
who all, like <HI>wise</HI> men, vie with each other, who shall
be most assiduous, most agreeable, present her the best
gifts; whilst we European women, that is, some <HI>few old
fashioned</HI> creatures, are studying perpetually how to please
our husbands, as that <HI>horrid</HI> old fashioned writer, St. Paul,
directs, 'The woman that is married careth for the things
of the world, how she may <HI>please her husband.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The wonderfully witty sister of the Editor often says,
<Q REND="inline">"Aye, aye, it <HI>might be so</HI> in St. Paul's time; but their care
<HI>now,</HI> seems to be to please every man <HI>but</HI> their <HI>husband;</HI>
and he, poor soul, is left to please himself as well as he
can. Well, well; there <HI>must</HI> be a <HI>reckoning</HI> for it <HI>some
time hence,</HI> poor silly creatures!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccxxvi" REF="338"/>
Mrs. Berkeley told her Son, that if he was <HI>ambitious</HI> of
uniting himself with a descendant of the Father of the
Faithful, the FRIEND OF GOD,—delightful title which all
should strive to merit—all who do strive in earnest may at∣tain—he
must look out for himself; for that her lovely
friend had been many years the happy wife of the sensible,
learned, highly accomplished, throughly polite Raphael
Brandon, Esquire.</P>
<P>Mr. Brandon writes English as correctly, and very much
more elegantly, than many eminent English scholars. The
Editor has letters of this gentleman's carefully preserved,
that prove the truth of this assertion; she expressing some
surprize at it, was told by Mr. Brandon, that on his
coming from Portugal to England, at about seventeen, the
master appointed to teach himself and brother English, re∣commended
it to them to study diligently Bishop Lowth's
English Grammar, which he has done to excellent effect.
The Editor advises all youths, sons of her friends, who are
going into navy, army, or the East, unable to enjoy that
<HI>great, solid</HI> blessing of an <HI>English</HI> university education, to
purchase, and study it. Many have followed the advice,
and blessed her for it. It distresses one to hear a brave
Admiral, or valiant General, speaking as incorrectly as an
Abigail.</P>
<P><PB N="cccxxvii" REF="339"/>
The writing the word <HI>Jew,</HI> brings to the Editor's recol∣lection,
and she <HI>cannot</HI> deny herself the <HI>pleasure of writing,</HI>
and, she hopes, some few feeling hearts the <HI>pleasure of
reading,</HI> a little anecdote of Mr. Monck Berkeley, and some
Canterbury Jews. About the year 1785, the shop of a very
respectable woollen-draper and master-tailor was broke
open, and robbed of goods and money to a large amount.
Every one was at a loss to guess who had done the deed,
excepting the worthy sufferer. A gentleman of large for∣tune,
of strict integrity, on whom the Editor bestowed the
title of RHADAMANTHUS, as apt to say unpleasant things,
as his sweetly amiable son is to utter pleasing ones, thought
proper to say, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (the name not recollected by
the Editor) <HI>had robbed himself.</HI>"</Q> This naturally rouzed
the honest man, who said, <Q REND="inline">"he <HI>must now</HI> find out the burg∣larian
at any rate."</Q> He immediately procured a war∣rant
to apprehend his journeyman, who had served a seven
years' apprenticeship to him, and behaved himself in the
most exemplary manner. He immediately accused his
accomplice, a journeyman hair-dresser. They were both
examined by the Mayor, and committed to prison. Mr.
Berkeley coming home, the Editor at dinner asked him
<Q REND="inline">"if he knew this young Jew who had committed the
robbery;"</Q> to which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Poor creature, he had
never committed this, nor probably any other robbery,
if he had not been drawn in by a vile rascal of a Chris∣tian,
as he is by courtesy styled, a villain. It was
<PB N="cccxxviii" REF="340"/>
moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy
master gave of him, until, he said, within these last few
months, that he became acquainted with this <HI>Christian</HI>
rascal, when he became idle, and, of course, vicious."</Q>
No human being, surely, ever had a greater dread of idle∣ness
than Mr. Monck Berkeley; and often, during the lat∣ter
part of his illness, used to exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"What an idle life
I lead! Surely God will, I fear, call me into judgement
for it. I do nothing; I write nothing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley lamented, that, through the stupidity of the
<HI>then</HI> town clerk, the poor creature had not been admitted
to bail. After dinner he retired to his own apartment,
and consulted his law books. He was to leave Canterbury
very early the next morning, in company with his very
amiable neighbour, William Deedes, Junior, Esquire, of
St. Stephen's, Canterbury, both being obliged to keep
term that day at the Temple—Mr. Deedes, that he might
not idle away a large estate, which he now possesses and
spends most worthily; Mr. Berkeley, that he might get
one, as he probably would have done, had it pleased God
to have blessed him with health.</P>
<P>About eleven o'clock at night Mr. Berkeley came home,
and thus accosted his Mother: <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, you
must be pleased to <HI>promise me,</HI> that you will go to-mor∣row
morning, the minute you have breakfasted, <HI>before</HI>
<PB N="cccxxix" REF="341"/>
<HI>you go to church,</HI> to this poor creature's parents, and tell
them, that if they do not retain Garrow to plead for their
son, he will certainly be sentenced to death—that Gar∣row
can and will get him off. I know he has a cause
this assize at Maidstone, and if they will give him sixty
guineas he will come on to Canterbury. Don't let them
<HI>hackle</HI> with him; for he will not come for a less fee, and
I know he will come for that; and <HI>I</HI> repeat it, and I de∣sire
you to say, that <HI>nothing else can</HI> save their son—poor
fellow!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I know not even where they live."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! John will find that out for you."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I do not know them; and they would think
it very odd in me, an ignorant woman"</Q>—</P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Odd</HI> or <HI>even,</HI> best of Mothers, if you don't
this minute <HI>promise me solemnly</HI> that you will go, and
say what I have desired you, I will take my hat, and
knock them up, and tell it them myself."</Q></P>
<P>To prevent her Son's going, Mrs. Berkeley, though with
but an indifferent grace, made the promise, and after
prayers the family retired. In the morning, a little before
five, the hour the chaise was ordered, Mr. Berkeley crept
into the chamber like a zephyr, that he might not disturb his
<PB N="cccxxx" REF="342"/>
Father, a very bad sleeper, and repeated in his Mother's
ear all she was to say. The promise once obtained, he had
no uneasiness on that score. The Editor, after breakfast,
set off for Best's Lane, where she witnessed <HI>such</HI> a scene, as
(her dear compassionate Son being removed) she trusts, and
thinks, no one can <HI>ever again</HI> compel her to witness.</P>
<P>On entering the house, she saw affliction personified in
the figure of a decent middle-aged woman. Mrs. Berke∣ley,
conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young
man, began condoling with her. Soon coming to the
point, telling her who she was, and delivering her Son's
message, the poor woman exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"My God, what
goodness! that <HI>such</HI> a gentleman should condescend to
think about such a <HI>poor wretch</HI> as I am. Oh! may God
reward him!!! Well! to be sure, somebody <HI>did</HI> tell me
that a fine young gentleman, one of the Prebendary's
Sons, did say, walking on the Parade with other gentle∣men,
that my <HI>poor boy need not</HI> have been committed to
gaol."</Q> She instantly rose, and called her husband. On
his entering the room, she repeated Mr. Berkeley's message
with delight—when, horrid to relate,—what can one call
him? not a descendant of Abraham by Sarah, not a <HI>Sara∣cen,</HI>
as the descendants of Esau style themselves, that they
be not mistaken for the descendants of Abraham by Hagar.
he must have been an <HI>Ishmaelite,</HI> worse than an Ishmaelite;
for not only his hand, but his HORRID tongue, was against
<PB N="cccxxxi" REF="343"/>
his <HI>own</HI> child; for, in an hoarse surly voice, he said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>No,
no; I shall do not such thing; let him take his chance; if he
can't get off, he must be hanged.</HI>"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, on seeing
the agonies of the poor distracted mother, longed to have
said to him, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You will be damned.</HI>"</Q> She did, however, re∣strain
her indignation a little, and joined the supplications
of the wretched Mother, elevated with Mr. Berkeley's
message into confidence of her poor son's life, now thrown
into the deepest despair. Never did the Editor so much
wish for a large fortune as at that moment, to have given
the mother the fee for the counsel that Mr. Monck Berkeley
so earnestly recommended. After finding all soothing utterly
in vain, she gave a loose to her indignation, saying every thing
that it suggested to her. At length, bidding farewel to this
wretched mourning mother, she returned home, without
deigning to look at the old father. Much it may be sup∣posed
<HI>he</HI> felt this. Not so his kind adviser, Mr. Monck
Berkeley. One of the Editor's <HI>minor</HI> punishments for her
children, when young, until ten or twelve years old, was,
<Q REND="inline">"You have not behaved well, in so, or so; I will not look
at you until to-morrow dinner time."</Q> This was so keenly
felt by her eldest Son, Mr. Monck Berkeley, that he would
often, in the sweetest voice, supplicate, <Q REND="inline">"Now do forget
it, and look at me a little."</Q> A proof this, of what the
Editor frequently asserts, <Q REND="inline">"That a little common sense,
and great steadiness, may rescue children from <HI>much</HI> cor∣poral
<PB N="cccxxxii" REF="344"/>
punishment, and make a more lasting impression on
their minds."</Q></P>
<P>Compassion carried her, sometimes, when taking her
morning walk, to visit this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>House of moarning.</HI>"</Q> This
melancholy affair happened several weeks before the assizes.
The wretch remained inflexible, and the poor mother in
such a state of despair, as never to wash her hands or face,
put on or take off her cloaths, sitting the whole day without
uttering a word. At length, just before the trial was to
come on, some more powerful orator than Mrs. Berkeley;
probably some modern TERTULLUS, prevailed on the old
wretch to send and retain Mr. Garrow, who came on from
Maidstone to Canterbury; and, as Mr. Berkeley had fore∣told,
got the poor young Jew off for transportation for life.
Some kind Christian neighbour (for she and her children
were esteemed by all, as the poor soul justly said, for more
than twenty years past) flew out of the Guildhall, and told
her the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>joyful tidings.</HI>"</Q>—She started up, fell on her knees,
thanked God, went up stairs, dressed herself neatly as
formerly, went out to the fish-market, and ordered hom
her matters for her family as usual.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley, on hearing it, as all the city was talking of
it, expressed his astonishment, that the mind could so soon,
after such length of time, recover its wanted energy. The
Editor, it may be supposed, did not fail to call in Bests
<PB N="cccxxxiii" REF="345"/>
Lane, and obey the delightfully pleasing injunction of the
Apostle—<Q REND="inline">"Rejoice with them that do rejoice."</Q> The
worthy woman's gratitude, ascribing the <HI>temporal</HI> salvation
of her son to Mr. Monck Berkeley's judicious, amiably
kind advice, in which all agreed, was very delightful to the
fond heart of his happy mother.</P>
<P>It is impossible to omit mentioning here, that, in the
year 1793, Dr. Berkeley had with him, at Canterbury,
Mr. Patrick Satterley, eldest son of the skilful, successful,
humane Mr. Satterley, surgeon and apothecary, of Hastings,
for whom Dr. Berkeley had taken a lodging, accidentally, at
a silversmith's in Palace Street, whose worthy wife was
sister to the young man rescued from the gallows by Mr.
Berkeley. Mr. Satterley getting a violent fever, and Dr.
Berkeley going to him, they discovered that he was the
father of their brother's benefactor, and immediately declared
that no nurse was necessary, for that they esteemed it their
duty to render every possibly attention to any friend of that
dear good Mr. Berkeley, who had been the means of
rescuing their poor brother from an ignominious death.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, on going to Hastings, was told by his
surgeon in town, Mr. Blicke, that he would find a most
skilful, attentive, medical man in Mr. Satterley. This
gentleman is famous for rescuing persons from <Q REND="inline">"the house
appointed, at length, for all the descendant of Adam,"</Q>
<PB N="cccxxxiv" REF="346"/>
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Apostate</HI> Adam,"</Q> as good Dr. Joshua Smith styles him, in
his "Hickes's Psalms." The aged, he, by God's blessing, on
his great medical skill, preserves, in <HI>comfortable</HI> health, to
extreme old age—the <HI>dreadfully rash</HI> young, who presume to
rush, uncalled, into the presence of <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>great Judge</HI> of
quick and dead,"</Q> by his great chirurgical skill. The
Editor <HI>knows</HI> two thus happily rescued by him; and she
knows of several others—one old wretch, the late ***********,
the murderer of her amiable accomplished friend,
the late Judge Advocate of *******.</P>
<P>Mr. Satterley, <HI>presuming</HI> to give himself a few holydays,
to make a visit to his eldest son, a very elegant amiable
young man, at Oxford, of whom he said to Mr. Monck
Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"That young man, from a child, has never done
<HI>that thing</HI> that I wished him not to do;"</Q> this horrid old
monster dismissed Mr. Satterley, and called in other medical
aid, who, in one short fortnight, dismissed HIM—to a place
whence he will never return, until called to meet the
amiable, throughly Honourable Mr. *******. This old
monster had prefixed to his name (by birth) that pretty
elegant word, which should remind all who possess it, not
to disgrace it, <HI>Honourable</HI> *****.</P>
<P>The Editor is sometimes, by one or two of her <HI>gnat∣straining,</HI>
although not <HI>camel-swallowing</HI> friends, accused
of <HI>want of charity,</HI> in <HI>guessing</HI> at the place of abode of some
<PB N="cccxxxv" REF="347"/>
departed spirits; to which she replies, from her old-fashioned
book, <Q REND="inline">"The HOLY SPIRIT declares, that <HI>without</HI> HOLINESS
<HI>no</HI> man, or woman either, however beautiful, &amp;c. shall
see the LORD."</Q> Do you think that General <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, or
Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, were HOLY persons? The Editor has no
doubt, but that many very <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of our witty, as well as pious, <HI>antient</HI> Divines, says, <Q REND="inline">"Hell will be paved with <HI>good resolutions,</HI> filled with <HI>good sort</HI> of people."</Q></NOTE> good <HI>sort</HI> of people will declare,
that the Editor's Preface deserves to be <HI>burnt</HI> by the hands
of the common hangman; but, if it benefits or consoles
one <HI>single</HI> soul, she will esteem herself happy.</P>
<P>The last time the Editor visited Canterbury, alas! she
called on the worthy Israelites, to thank them for their kind
gratitude shewn to Mr. Patrick Satterley; when they re∣peated
to her what they had, as above related, said to Dr.
Berkeley. There are certainly some <Q REND="inline">"<HI>double distilled superfine
elegant</HI>"</Q> CHRISTIANS in Canterbury, who might have
learned gratitude from these Jews in humble station.</P>
<P>When Mr. Monck Berkeley was a very little boy, the
very respectable <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Henchman, Esquire, of the India
House, losing his worthy father before he was fourteen,
was sent off to India. On bidding adieu to his elegant mo∣ther,
he threw his arms about her; saying, <Q REND="inline">"Farewel,
my dear mother; God only knows whether we shall ever
meet again in this world. But comfort yourself with this,
<PB N="cccxxxvi" REF="348"/>
that as I leave you an <HI>honest</HI> boy, whether I live or die,
by God's blessing, you shall never hear of me but as an
<HI>honest</HI> man."</Q> So saying, he quitted the house; and,
from what the Editor gathers from her news-paper, Mr.
Henchman seems to keep his charming early promise. The
Editor has not the pleasure of being at all acquainted with
him, having never seen him since his return from India,
The above little anecdote is related <HI>verbatim,</HI> as it was told
to Dr. Berkeley and herself at the time, by their sensible
agreeable friend, the late Reverend Humphrey Henchman,
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. Both these gentle∣men
were grand and great-grandsons of Bishop Henchman
of London. This story was very frequently told to Mr.
Monck Berkeley by his Mother, during his childhood and
youth, with exhortations to make the same resolution. Mr.
Berkeley used frequently to say, <Q REND="inline">"Whatever faults I have, I
thank God, and my dear Mother, that I am an <HI>honest</HI>
man."</Q> He was in truth so; and, it may with equal
truth be asserted, a man of the strictest honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When Mr. Monck Berkeley was a very little boy, his mother made him get in memory the lines of Mr. Pope; <HI>a little altered for his particular</HI> use:
<Q><L>"Reflect that lessen'd fame is ne'er regain'd,</L>
<L>"And <HI>boyish</HI> honour <HI>once</HI> is always stain'd."</L></Q>
When about six years old, he came one day to his mother, with Pope in his hand, saying, <Q REND="inline">"My dear mama—here is a man that has got your verses, and printed them, but not <HI>quite write,</HI> for he says <HI>virgin</HI> honour."</Q> Mr. Monck Berkeley, when grown up, used to say, <Q REND="inline">"What a little fool I must have been, not to find out that my mother was the alterer, not Mr. Pope."</Q> Mrs. George Berkeley incurred some ridicule for thus early instilling into her little boy a sense of honour; but, where <HI>conscience</HI> is concerned, she ever did, by GOD's grace ever will, defy <HI>ridicule;</HI> which, let the wretched Lord Shaftesbury say what he will, is <Q REND="inline">"<HI>not the test of</HI> TRUTH;</Q> for such a genius as his Lordship may ridicule the whole life of the Saviour of the World. His Lordship's death <HI>merited</HI> ridi∣cule. Bishop Berkeley has frequently told his son, <Q REND="inline">"that so lamentably ill-tempered was he in the latter stage of his life, that his poor lady used, when any company arrived, to post out of the room, and conjure them, for <HI>her</HI> sake, to assent to <HI>every</HI> thing her Lord asserted or said, or it would put him into such a passion as might kill him."</Q> Happy philosophy for one on the brink of the grave!!!</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="cccxxxvii" REF="349"/>
The Editor has to return her most grateful heartfelt ac∣knowledgements
for the wonderfully kind, amiable atten∣tions
of the Reverend Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canter∣bury,
for his incessant unwearied exertions in <HI>endeavouring</HI> to
lighten her <HI>heavy</HI> business at Canterbury. It was <HI>her</HI> mis∣fortune,
<HI>not his</HI> fault, that he happened to pitch upon the
last man in England whom she would have appointed her
surveyor, and more particularly as he owed very great obli∣gations
to Dr. Berkeley. The Editor, some weeks ago,
being advised by a printer to apply to a paper-maker, a very
rich man, for paper to print off the second volume of Lite∣rary
Relics prepared by Mr. Monck Berkeley; the sup∣plying
it was <HI>civilly</HI> declined. The Editor remarked, that
she was sure, before she wrote, that it would, because he
was under very important obligations to Dr. Berkeley. The
very worthy bookseller, the obliging Mr. Cook, of Oxford,
said, <Q REND="inline">"Do I understand you right, Madam?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir,
I have, in repeated instances, since my loss of Dr. Berke∣ley,
<PB N="cccxxxviii" REF="350"/>
experienced it; as, through the goodness of God, I
have met with numerous instances of <HI>real</HI> friendship,
where neither on Dr. Berkeley's or my own account I
had <HI>any</HI> right to expect <HI>any</HI> attention but civility."</Q> It is
impossible for the Editor to pass on without inserting here
the name of the witty, worthy William Hey, Esquire,
Commissioner of the Customs, for his unwearied exer∣tions
to serve her: the noble, the angelic conduct of
the worthy Mrs. Taylor, of Clarges Street, Piccadilly, an
<HI>eléve</HI> of the lovely Mrs. Catharine Talbot, who had the hap∣piness
to live with her many years; who, hearing that the
Editor (not caring to <HI>coin</HI>) was in some difficulties, most
generously wrote to her, offering to sell out her <HI>whole</HI> for∣tune
to lend to Mrs. Berkeley, the stocks then at sixty-five.
It may easily be <HI>guessed</HI> what answer the Editor returned to
this <HI>wonderful</HI> offer—may HE who seeth in secret, reward
her openly!—Indeed she has as many <HI>friends</HI> as acquaintances.
Yes, may HE who rewardeth every man <HI>according</HI> to his
works, reward these worthy compasionate friends—com∣passionate
I repeat; for an aged matron, without a son,
although not quite a beggar, <HI>may</HI> be, very often is, a great
object of compassion.</P>
<P>The Editor's thanks are particularly due, her prayers are
daily offered at the throne of Grace—may they be heard,
and answered an hundred, a thousand fold, on them and
theirs—to her excellent old friend, Sir Richard Hill, for
<PB N="cccxxxix" REF="351"/>
the trouble he has taken, is perpetually still taking, con∣cerning
her affairs, English and Irish. To the amiable Dr.
Lynch, as above mentioned, to the very learned, grateful
Mr. Sawkins, student of Christ Church, for literally <HI>forcing</HI>
money upon her, when she could not procure a guinea
from Ireland, enabling her to pay a quarter's salary to one of
Dr. Berkeley's Curates, who wrote <HI>twice</HI> before Dr. Berkeley
had been dead three weeks. The salary became due on the
21st of December, 1794. Mrs. Berkeley lost her beloved
Partner on the 6th of January, 1795, exactly sixteen days
after. Dr. Berkeley, whether he received money or not
from Ireland, was always most scrupulously, <HI>conscientiously,</HI>
careful to pay his Curates' salary, from the time that he
had the happiness at twenty-six of having his beloved, re∣spected
friend, the very learned Mr. John Whitaker<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This worthy gentleman is a lineal descendant of the spirited Walworth, Lord Mayor of London. His uncle, the late Major Walworth, was the last male descendant of that NOBLE magistrate of the City of London.</NOTE>, the
able, the unanswerable Vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots,
in that relation to him, as also the excellently pious Philip
Gurdon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>This excellent gentleman is now residing on the large estate on which the Conqueror <HI>found</HI> his grand-sire—long may he and his descendants enjoy it! They owe it to the most wonderful instance of true friendship, perhaps, ever per∣formed by any <HI>meerly</HI> human being. The Editor here sets down the story, as it has often been related to her by the excellent Mr. Gurdon, when curate to Dr. Berkeley, at Cookham.</P>
<P>In the year 1647, <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Gourdon (as it was then spelt), Esquire, was nominated one of the Judges to try the unfortunate King Charles—he deter∣mined to attend—the minister of his parish used many arguments to dissuade him, but all in vain. The night before he was to commence his journey to London, he stayed with him till eleven o'clock (a late hour in the those wiser times), telling him, that, setting aside the <HI>indignity</HI> of the business, it would be the destruction of his <HI>antient</HI> family and <HI>large</HI> estate: at length, the excellent pastor, unable to prevail on his <HI>steady</HI> patron, took his leave. Early the next morning Mr. Gurdon set out for London; a long narrow lane lay between his house and the high road—on a sudden the coach stopped, with a violent jerk, in the narrowest part of the lane. The coachman called out to the postillion, to know why he dared to stop so suddenly. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"The horses won't go on."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">" Whip them then."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I can't, for Dr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (name forgotten by the Editor) lies across the road, all in the mud."</Q>—Mr. Gurdon, putting his head out of the coach, enquired the cause; when his heavenly pastor spoke as follows: <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, you are going on a most iniquitous business. I have said <HI>all</HI> I am capable of <HI>saying;</HI> I am now doing all that <HI>I</HI> am capable of <HI>doing.</HI> If you <HI>will</HI> go, you shall; drive over <HI>my body.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Gurdon, struck, (the Editor can never relate it without her eyes filled with tears), fell back in his coach; then, recovering himself, said, <Q REND="inline">"Thou best of men, I will go back; come into the coach to me."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, not unless you swear to me that you will give up the matter;"</Q> which Mr. Gurdon did; and, by so doing, preserved his estate for the present excellent amiable possessor of it. On the King's return, Mr. Gurdon was attained, as one of the King's Judges; his name is in the list, the Editor thinks, in Nalson's "Life of Charles the First;" but it was happily proved that Mr. Gurdon <HI>did not attend.</HI></P></NOTE> of Assenwick Hall, in Suffolk, both gentlemen of
<PB N="cccxl" REF="352"/> fortune; but the idea of detaining a Curate's
salary, how∣ever rich he might be, always hurt him. It is supposed the
worthy man who applied so expeditiously to his relict, conceived that she
could not be hurt, but by a pair of red hot pincers.—A young Sprig of
Divinity also, too old to have acted thus, whose worthy father ever
gratefully ac∣knowledged himself under high obliations to Dr. Berkeley on
many accounts, <HI>pecuniary</HI> as well as other, employed a
<PB N="cccxli" REF="353"/> LAWYER to write to the Editor, before the interment
of her beloved Partner, demanding the payment of—a not very large sum,
borrowed by Dr. Berkeley of his father during Dr. Berkeley's Chancery suit in
Ireland. The Edi∣tor is indebted to the goodness of Dr. Berkeley's worthy old
friend, the Reverened the Dean of Hereford, for answering the <HI>Lawyer's
Letter,</HI> and adjusting matters with this <HI>grate∣ful Divine,</HI> who,
in his early youth was one of the <HI>many quarterers</HI> on Dr. Berkeley's
wonderful hospitality. Pity to the FATHER of the Divinity Sprig prevents his
name from appearing in these pages. The Editor involuntarily ex∣claimed, with
the antient Sage,
<Q REND="inline">"Thrifty, careful of the MAIN chance, as this young man is, I
had rather have my dead son, than two such living ones."</Q> He wrote a
very fine letter <HI>apologetic</HI> to the Editor for his <HI>prudence;</HI>
to which, as she was not by her friends <HI>permitted</HI> to answer in her
own style, when wounded, <HI>she</HI> never returned any answer at all;
and, only laments, that his zeal to recover so <HI>speedily</HI> a sum,
considerably under two hundred pounds, should have reduced him to the
<HI>meanness</HI> of falsifying; as the attorney, however clever, could not
by inspiration have dictated the carefully preserved epistle to the
Editor, with∣out orders from his employer. Indeed he therein says he had
orders, &amp;c—Should this Preface happen to be redde by the Curate, or
the <HI>Sprig</HI> of Divinity; if they keep their <HI>own</HI> counsel, the
Editor means not to publish their names, nor to make them known to more
persons than their own <PB N="cccxlii" REF="354"/> <HI>wonderful</HI> conduct
naturally introduced them to.—Quitting these <HI>prudent</HI>
persons, the Editor turns to more pleasant ones.</P>
<P>The worthy friends of Mrs. Berkeley, who in that very
early period of her affliction visited <Q REND="inline">"the house of mourn∣ing,"</Q>
laboured to heal, not to tear open, her <HI>deep</HI> wounds.
They thought not, they acted not, like these two <HI>Divines;</HI>
but, as was most elegantly expressed in a polite kind letter
of enquiry to a friend, from Mrs. Trenchard of Hendon's
House: <Q REND="inline">"My heart bleeds for those two <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> ladies; <HI>before</HI>
their <HI>deep</HI> wounds for the loss of Mr. Berkeley are
healed, to have them <HI>thus</HI> torn open afresh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There subsisted between Dr. Berkeley and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Frin∣sham, the sincerest tender friendship.</NOTE>."</Q> Mrs.
Trenchard cannot, probably, translate Greek, nor write La∣tin,
quite so well as these Divines; but she has a highly
cultivated mind, and a most feeling heart.</P>
<P>The names, as above mentioned, are not communicated,
because the Editor believes the <HI>hasty</HI> Curate a <HI>really worthy</HI> man,
although not blessed with <HI>quite</HI> so much delicacy as the wor∣thy
daughter of farmer Strange, of Heddington near Oxford,
who, about five months after the death of Dr. Berkeley,
presented a bill to the Editor for corn and hay. On her
coming into the room to receive her money, a pretty con∣siderable
<PB N="cccxliii" REF="355"/>
sum, Mrs. Berkeley, enquiring of her why she
had not applied before, as she might probably have been
glad of it; with the spirit of a princess, of an angel, she
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Good Madam, how could I think of <HI>troubling you</HI>
for a <HI>few</HI> pounds in <HI>your deep affliction?</HI> I wonder I could
do it now; but I heard you were about to leave Oxford,
and I thought perhaps you might not know of this bill;
but, if it is any inconvenience to you to pay it now, I
am perfectly willing to wait for it."</Q> May this worthy
woman never experience the loss of her good husband, and
an only child!</P>
<P>The forming this kind wish for this amiable-hearted wo∣man
brings to the Editor's mind what occurred many years
ago. Walking out one evening, she called at a farm-house,
to enquire for some pigeons. The mistress presented her∣self.
Mrs. Berkeley, wishing to shorten her walk home
requested the good woman to direct her the nearer way in
crossing the fields. Mrs. Berkeley, not to appear proud,
began enquiring what family she had? The reply made, she
added, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! Madam, I have <HI>thrice</HI> known the <HI>sorrows of
widowhood.</HI>"</Q> It had not <HI>much</HI> injured her health. She
was remarkably plump and <Q REND="inline">"well favoured;"</Q> perhaps she
may have suffered the same sorrows again. She might,
perhaps, be as great a philosopher as her daughter, who
kept a shop in the next parish, where Dr. Berkeley's family
bought many odd things, whose daughter, a fine girl of se∣venteen,
<PB N="cccxliv" REF="356"/>
was dying of a consumption. Mrs. Berkeley, one
Sunday, at church, enquired after the young woman. On
hearing there were no hopes of her recovery, she condoled
with the mother, who made the following reply: it is set
down <HI>verbatim.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Good lack-a-day, Madam, why <HI>she</HI> and
<HI>I did not come into the world</HI> at the <HI>same time;</HI> and why
should we think to <HI>go out</HI> at the <HI>same time?</HI>"</Q> Probably
these good women mourned the loss of relatives, as did a
tenant's wife of the late worthy agreeable Capt. Bartlam of
Moore Hall. The day after the death of her husband Mrs.
Bartlam called to see her, and began condoling with her,
to whom she replied, <Q REND="inline">"O good lack-a-daisy, Madam, 'tis
a <HI>sad thing, to be sure.</HI> I have been CRYING <HI>all</HI> the morn∣ing
<HI>long;</HI> and as soon as ever I have ate this bit of bread
and cheese, and drank this <HI>drap</HI> of ale, (a pint,) I must
go to it again as hard as I can for my life."</Q></P>
<P>How often has the Editor seen a table full of company, at
Dr. Berkeley's, laugh until <HI>unforced</HI> tears bedewed their cheeks,
when this story was related, and acted by that best of story-tellers,
the late delightfully witty Reverend James Hamilton,
grandson of Lord Abercorn, formerly named in this Preface.
As also, that he spent the whole of the summer at Dr. Berke∣ley's,
his curate constantly going to Mr. Hamilton's house in
Warwickshire, in May, and remaining there until November,
in order that Mr. Hamilton might, as Dr. Berkeley used to
say, <Q REND="inline">"give <HI>him</HI> all the time he could spare from his <HI>friends,</HI>
<PB N="cccxlv" REF="357"/>
the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fishes
of the river."</Q> Mr. Hamilton, although an excellent scholar,
was wonderfully fond of hunting, shooting, and fishing.
Dr. Berkeley, living on the banks of the Thames, had al∣ways
a large pleasure-boat of his own, in which Mr. Hamil∣ton,
an excellent sailor and rower, was perpetually on the
water, alone, early in the morning, but frequently took Mr.
Monck Berkeley with him. Mrs. Berkeley, dreading his too
volatile agility, feared that, in <HI>attempting</HI> to ASSIST Mr.
Hamilton in sailing or rowing, he might be drowned;
notwithstanding her strong opinion, still retained by the
Editor, although often laughed at by Mr. Hamilton, that
infants, if put into the water, would swim naturally, as
well as puppies, kittens, calves, &amp;c. He often urged her
to <HI>try the experiment</HI> on her own little boy. Mrs. Berkeley
told him she was not an <HI>experimental</HI> philosopher, and was
terribly afraid he might be drowned, with his garments,
<HI>not</HI> provided by nature like kittens, &amp;c<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During Mr. Berkeley's stay at the King's school, nothing could prevail upon him to swim out of his depth; to the great discontent of his mother. One day, after having been some time at Eton, a young gentleman from Eton came over to see him; and, happening to relate something, said to Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"You know he swims as well as you do."</Q>—To which the Editor re∣plied, <Q REND="inline">"That is not at all I suppose."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">O yes, Madam, Berkeley is, I really think, the best swimmer in the school. I don't suppose <HI>any</HI> thing could drown him, but the boat fastening him in the mud—he swims like a duck."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley asked her son, how this came to pass? he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, they found what a fool I was, so a party of them took me out in a boat, and when we were got into deep water, contrived to throw me overboard, then rowed away; they kindly waited to see whether I could swim, in order to take me up if I could not. I, horridly frighted, instantly swam after them, and have swum, as he says, 'like a duck,' ever since. I am sure I was much obliged by them;</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"Eton for ever, say I!"</Q> The Editor had frequently, before her Son was born, heard Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> relate this prac∣tice of the Etonians to a new comer; and it actually occasioned her worrying her Lord out of his <HI>determination</HI> of sending his son to Eton. Folly, thy name is <HI>Woman.</HI> Accordingly <HI>Lordy,</HI> as they style the Peers' eldest son in Scotland, had NOTHING of Eton about him when he came out into life. The Editor's kindred had always been Etonians and Oxonians. She does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out foolish <HI>vaut-riens.</HI> Mr. Berkeley, like most Eton men, was a very excellent rower, as was most happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his father's boat. Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. had gone up the river, to dine at Medenham Abbey—soon after they had entered the boat to return, a most dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, and rain came on. Some of the ladies were much terrified; which Mr. Berkeley perceiving, said to Mr. Wrightson, <Q REND="inline">"Come, John, give me your oar;"</Q> and the Editor fears to set down in how short a time Mr. Berkeley, and his father's gardener, formerly a most excellent waterman, now an helpless aged almshouse-man at Maiden∣head, rowed eleven miles—the boat seemed to fly. But Mr. Berkeley exerted himself so violently, (happily for the party, for, within ten minutes after their landing, the storm became frightfully tremendous indeed,) that he could scarce use his elegant, astonishingly strong fingers for three days after.—Mr. Monck Berkeley, and several of the Monck family, have that sort of fingers which seem as if they have neither sinews or bone in them, but, when called into action, feel like iron. The Editor used frequently to request her son, when he had given her his hand, feeling like peeling sattin, to <HI>stiffen</HI> it, which he would instantly do; and she conceives that no two men, without he chose it, could have unbent it. Neither his father nor his brother had their fingers so wonderfully formed by nature.</NOTE>. begged Mr.
<PB N="cccxlvi" REF="358"/>
Hamilton to reject his suit, and leave him on the
terrass. One day, seeing Mr. Hamilton preparing to sail,
<PB N="cccxlvii" REF="359"/>
he screamed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear Jemmy, pray take me with
you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, I must not; your Mamma is afraid
you will be drowned."</Q> Mr. Berkeley immediately
walked into the Thames in his petticoats, being then little
more than three years old, and pursued the boat. Mr.
Hamilton, instantly putting back, asked him, if he was not
afraid of being drowned, as he must have been if he had
not put back. The spirited little creature replied, <Q REND="inline">"Aye,
aye; <HI>but I considered,</HI> before I walked in, that you would
<HI>certainly</HI> come back and take me before the water got up
to my chin, because Mamma would have been <HI>so</HI> grieved
if I had been drowned."</Q> The same sound judgement and
resolute spirit accompanied him through life.</P>
<P>A Scotch gentleman of consequence one day, at St. An∣drews,
said to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, I last night saw your agree∣able
Son as <HI>fou</HI> with water as most of the company were
with wine."</Q> Dr. Berkeley, who himself drank nothing
but water, expressed his wonder at it. Mrs. Berkeley, sup∣posing
the gentleman was a dealer in the marvellous, men∣tioned
it to her Son in that way; to which he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my dear Madam, it is very true; I am often as
drunk with water as others are with wine; with this,
however very material difference, that when it is pro∣posed
to break bottles, glasses, and burn chairs, tables,
&amp;c. I instantly become as sober as a judge, and have
sometimes prevented much mischief."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccxlviii" REF="360"/>
When Mr. Berkeley entered at the university of St. An∣drews,
one of the college officers called upon him to depo∣sit
a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr.
Berkeley said, that <Q REND="inline">"as he should reside in his Father's
house, it was little likely he should break any windows,
having never, that he remembered, broke one in his
whole life."</Q> He was assured that he <HI>would</HI> do it at St.
Andrews. He therefore made the deposit; the cause of
which he some time after learned. On the rising of the
session, several of the students said, <Q REND="inline">"Now for the win∣dows.
Come, it is time to set off; let us sally forth."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be
done? They, with one voice, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why, to break
every window in college."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"For what reason?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh!
no reason; but that it has always been done from time
immemorial."</Q> Mr. Berkeley sedately replied, that he
begged to be excused joining the party: having never, when
a <HI>boy</HI> at Eton, and sometimes with more wine in his head than
was good for him, performed such a <HI>valiant</HI> feat, he should feel
himself exceedingly ashamed to be guilty of it as a <HI>young man.</HI>
He spoke so sensibly on the subject, that the practice was
from that time entirely given up, and has probably never
been revived. The money continued to be collected, as the
following little aneodote will shew. A very good kind of man,
formerly coachman at Lord Balcarras's, the College Porter,
was the collector. He one day told a very intimate friend of
Mr. Berkeley's, the young Laird of Kincaldrum, <Q REND="inline">"I am just
<PB N="cccxlix" REF="361"/>
come from a poor student indeed. I went for the win∣dow
<HI>croon;</HI> he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it,
saying, 'he brought but a croon to keep him all the
session, and he had spent six-pence of it; so I have got
only four and six-pence.' How he is to live I can't
tell, for they are very poor."</Q> Away flew the amiable
young Laird, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I must make a collection for him."</Q>
Amongst the students he first met Mr. Halket, eldest son of
Sir J. Halket, a beloved Scotch friend of Mr. Monck
Berkeley. This charming youth said, <Q REND="inline">"Here, take these
few shillings; it is <HI>all</HI> I have till I hear from home
again."</Q> The young Laird said, <Q REND="inline">"Such an one will give
a shilling, and such an one half a crown; and <HI>I</HI> will <HI>make</HI>
my dear Berkeley give a crown."</Q> The idea of his saying
<HI>make,</HI> diverted the whole university, who all knew Mr.
Berkeley's wonderful liberality to the poor. He soon met
Mr. Berkeley, who not only tossed out the crown, but said,
<Q REND="inline">"We will make a <HI>good</HI> collection; go you, Bower, (the
young Laird's name,) to the Scotch, and I to the Eng∣lish."</Q>
Mr. Berkeley posted home, and made his Father,
Mother, and Aunt subscribe largely, as also all the English
gentlemen students. The subscription, when closed, was
a very noble one. This poor youth was the son of a la∣bourer,
who, having <HI>two</HI> fields, about eight miles from
St. Andrews, kept <HI>three</HI> cows; one cow was sold to dress
him for the University, and put the <HI>lamented</HI> croon in his
pocket, to purchase coals. All the lower students study by
<PB N="cccl" REF="362"/>
fire light. He brought with him a large tub of oatmeal,
and a pot of salted butter, on which he was to subsist from
the 20th of October until the 20th of May, the space of
five months, but for this lucky affair of the <HI>croon,</HI> and the
lovely nature of the young Laird of Kincaldrum, as accom∣plished
as amiable. In what is called in Scotland an <HI>high
dance,</HI> this young gentleman could keep himself more than
half a minute—near a minute—in air. No one, who has
not seen a company of Highland soldiers dance, can form
<HI>any</HI> idea of it, more than our great-grandsires could of electri∣city
before Dr. Franklin's time.</P>
<P>The very humane worthy college cook agreed with the
young Laird and Mr. Berkeley to provide him a good din∣ner
of flesh or fish through the session. The Editor is sorry
to say, some of his countrymen said, <Q REND="inline">"that it was not <HI>quite
roight</HI> of these young gentlemen to make this subscription—they might be made every day."</Q></P>
<P>This brings to the Editor's mind the <HI>indignation</HI> of, she
is very sorry to say, <HI>a Divine,</HI> against her Son at Hastings,
for a similar offence. On the arrival of the three hundred
French clergy, within two days, at Hastings, Mr. Berkeley
said to his friend Mr. Grimston, <Q REND="inline">"It is impossible to let
these poor persecuted strangers starve in a foreign country;
we must try and make a subscription for them."</Q> Mr.
Grimston, <HI>jelon son coutume,</HI> tossed down his guinea. Mr.
<PB N="cccli" REF="363"/>
Monck Berkeley cried, <Q REND="inline">"Stop, stop, my dear friend, not
<HI>so</HI> fast, you will ruin all! No, I will draw up their case,
and you and I will set down against our names half∣a-crown
each; half-a-crown cannot distress any one who
has any thing to give. We may give as much more as
we please, but set down only two shillings and six-pence."</Q>
They accordingly did so, and amongst their acquaintance
got many subscribers. The paper was left at one of the
circulating libraries. The following account was related to
the Editor by a gentleman who was an eye-witness of the
transaction. The door opened, and a stout man entered,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"Who is <HI>this</HI> MR. BERKELEY, that makes himself
of <HI>such</HI> consequence, <HI>picking people's pockets</HI> for these
<HI>French</HI> ragamuffins? who is he? what is he?"</Q> Mr.
Berkeley, happening to be in a corner of the library, read∣ing,
rose, and, advancing with a very graceful bow, in the
mildest voice replied; <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Mr. Berkeley is a man of no
sort of consequence, nor pretends to be of any; but,
(quoting the Latin line, '<HI>as a man I must feel,</HI>' &amp;c.) he felt
it impossible not to <HI>try</HI> to alleviate the sufferings of these
poor unfortunate servants of our Blessed Master; and, as
by your <HI>habit,</HI> Sir, you appear to be of the <HI>clerical func∣tion,</HI>
I should have hoped <HI>you</HI> would <HI>rather</HI> have forwarded
than abused the attempt to relieve their <HI>real</HI> necessities:
no one is <HI>compelled</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this reason, the Editor always wishes the Prime Minister to make <HI>plenty</HI> of Lotteries, because then persons of small incomes may <HI>choose</HI> whether they will be half beggared by taxes, or not. The Editor used generally to get share of a twenty or fifty pounds prize; but lately the <HI>blind</HI> Goddess has de∣serted her, which is <HI>rather</HI> unkind, as she is now <HI>half</HI> blind.</NOTE> in cases of subscription. Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>
<PB N="ccclii" REF="364"/>
(name not at present recollected) the Librarian kindly
permitted it to lie here."</Q> Mr. Berkeley then bowed, and
retired to his book again, leaving the <HI>oratorical</HI> PARSON
(the Editor always styles an unworthy clergyman a PARSON)
ready to faint with shame. One day, after Mr. Berkeley's
arrival at Cheltenham, his family all in the drawing-room,
he asked, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, my dear friends, do any of you know Mr.
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> was the unanimous
voice. <Q REND="inline">"Well, you have <HI>no great</HI> loss: I am <HI>sorry</HI> to add,
that he is a Divine."</Q> Mr. Berkeley then related as
above.</P>
<P>Had these poor people applied to this <HI>Divine,</HI> as they did
to Mr. Berkeley, on the death of a French Marquis (whose
title the Editor forgets), they had not, perhaps, been as
much consoled as they were by a young <HI>Lawyer.</HI> They
came to Mr. Berkeley in great anxiety, to know whether
it was <HI>possible</HI> for <HI>him</HI> to get the Marquis buried in <HI>con∣secrated</HI>
ground. He assured them it would be impos∣sible
for <HI>him</HI> or any one else to prevent it; adding,
<Q REND="inline">"We Protestants are <HI>certainly better Christians</HI> than you
Papists; for, had <HI>I</HI> died in France, you would have
buried me in a cabbage-garden, or on the ramparts."</Q>
This point settled; the next, <Q REND="inline">"would <HI>le pauvre cher Marquis</HI>
<PB N="cccliii" REF="365"/>
have <HI>aucune office</HI> said over <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Editor cannot omit mentioning here a ludicrous occurrence on her first arrival in Scotland, sleeping at the <HI>neat pleasant</HI> town of Kelso, let Swift say what he will of <HI>Hell-so.</HI> As soon as she was up in the morning she walked out, and seeing a funeral she joined it, wishing to hear the <HI>Scottish</HI> funeral service: She enquired whether it was a young or an aged person, to proportion her sor∣row—ever lamenting the young—and, where hope is not precluded, rejoicing that the aged <Q REND="inline">"are delivered from the <HI>burdens</HI> of the flesh, &amp;c."</Q> The answer was, <Q REND="inline">"a very aged woman, near <HI>ninety.</HI>"</Q>—On her arrival in the kirk-yard, the ci∣vility of every the lower Scotch to strangers, where there are <HI>no bawbies in</HI> the case, made way for her to approach close to <Q REND="inline">"the house appointed for all living."</Q> The Editor did not endeavour to find out a minister robed in a surplice, well knowing the horror in which that innocent white robe is held by <HI>all</HI> diffenters from the Church of England and of Rome—but for a <HI>black goon:</HI> no such could her, then tolerable, eyes espy. The corpse was soon let down into the grave, which was filled up, when every man took off his hat, bowed at the grave, and the crowd began to disperse. Mrs. Berkeley, ex∣ceedingly shocked at what she had witnessed, asked a very sensible intelligent∣looking gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"if he could tell her what <HI>could</HI> have <HI>induced so very aged</HI> a person to have been her own executioner,"</Q> (not, as the newspapers phrase it, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>put a period</HI> to their <HI>existence.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Alas! alas! that <HI>they</HI> cannot do.)"</Q>—The gentleman replied, <Q REND="inline">"did she? poor woman! I never heard that; I should think she died of old age, quite worn out."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"But, Sir, if she had not <HI>destroyed herself,</HI> she must certainly have received <HI>christian burial?</HI>"</Q>—The gentleman, smiling, said, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I presume you are an English lady?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I arrived in Scotland only yesterday evening, Sir."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"I supposed so, Madam: we have <HI>no</HI> burial office in Scotland."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Were you ever in England?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! yes."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Ever at a funeral?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"At many."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Do you not think our burial service very fine?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Exquisitely so, indeed. And surely there is neither super∣stition or <HI>Poppery,</HI> as the Scotch speak Popery, in praying for <HI>ourselves,</HI> when God removes our friends or neighbours."</Q> This gentleman, the Editor learned, was a worthy physician of Kelso. At her return to the inn, relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old Scotch woman, and her dialogue at the grave, Doctor and Mr. Berkeley laughed immoderately. Dr. Berkeley used frequently to relate it to his Scotch friends at St. Andrew's. Mr. Berkeley used to say, it was treating their dead friends just as we treat favourite dead dogs. Mr. Monck Berkeley always made his father's gardener dig an handsome grave in one of the kitchen gardens, at Cookham, for his dogs; and himself used to plant two rose∣trees of different sorts, one at the head, and one at the foot, of their graves, which were always kept nicely turfed; he had wonderful tenderness, and love∣liness in his <HI>nature.</HI> Dr. Berkeley's carriage, on their journey to Scotland, fre∣quently overtook, and was overtaken by, the hearse, containing the corpse of the sensible, amiable, well-judging, Lord Robert Kerr, who died at Newberry, in Berkshire, at the age of twenty-eight. His regiment had been quartered at Canterbury six years before. His unassuming manners, a colonel at <HI>twenty-two,</HI> his attachment to the worthy old grey-headed major, always consulting him in every thing relating to the regiment, endeared him to all who knew him. The Editor used to tell several worthy Scotch ministers, that she grieved to think sweet Lord Robert should be dragged so many miles to be buried like an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> dog.</P>
<P>Had Mr. Monck Berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his child∣hood, they could not have applied to any one <HI>more</HI> likely to assist them. When under four years old, playing one morning in the dressing-room, he, on a sudden, flew to his Mother, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! Mamma, lay down your work, and <HI>see about it.</HI> For there is Dick States, the famous old sexton of Bray, burying a <HI>poor</HI> little child by <HI>himself,</HI> without either my Papa, or Mr. Har∣mer, to pray over it, or Mr. Wells, the clerk, to say Amen."</Q> This pious accomplished Curate of Dr. Berkeley has an exquisitely accomplished son, educated at Oxford, who is, the Editor fears, <HI>since</HI> Dr. Berkeley's death, a <HI>distressed</HI> Divine in London. His skill in music and French, were he not a Divine, must have procured him a large salary. His father was a wonderfully fine performer on many instruments; and had the finest voice also in preaching and reading, as well as in singing, that the Editor ever heard. Mrs. Berkeley told the young <HI>zealot,</HI> that it was some poor little infant, that, having died very soon after its birth, had not been baptized. The Editor took care to have all her own babes baptized <HI>within</HI> the hour after their birth, lest a fit should carry them off. Mrs. Berkeley used to ex∣press her astonishment to her mother, that she permitted <HI>her</HI> to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>vale of tears.</HI>"</Q> It could for the first part of her life, hardly, with propriety, be styled such to her; as, after pushing forth one short cry, to <HI>notisy,</HI> as the Scotch phrase it, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>she was in life;</HI>"</Q> as an infant, she <HI>never did cry at all;</HI> which occasioned a learned <HI>honest</HI> physician's being consulted, to know whether she had not <HI>some inward</HI> disorder, that prevented her crying, as infants usually do. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"Not she. She is a pure healthy good-humoured little Puss; so does not plague you, or herself, by squaliing."</Q>—Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma, <HI>you</HI> tell me, that God knows <HI>every</HI> thing <HI>before</HI> it happens. Now, if he <HI>knew</HI> that he <HI>intended</HI> this little child should stay such a <HI>very</HI> short time upon earth, <HI>I</HI> think it was <HI>hardly</HI> worth his while to give himself the <HI>trouble</HI> to send it down here <HI>at all.</HI>"</Q> It is needless to add here, the Editor's comments to her <HI>little</HI> inquisitive <HI>sceptie,</HI> who, if the expression may be permitted, watched GOD's dealings with man with a most jealous eye, hoping to espy a <HI>flaw.</HI> His <HI>com∣ments</HI> on the twenty-seventh chapter of Genesis, which he stumbled on, rather than searched out for himself, finding he had been made to miss it in his course of reading, cost the Editor <HI>much</HI> trouble to rectify, although she retained an ac∣curate remembrance of <HI>every</HI> word of a sermon preached on <HI>that whole chap∣ter</HI> by the late very learned Archdeacon of Berks, Dr. Dodwell, when she was about sixteen years old.</P></NOTE> him?"</Q>—<HI>Oui certainement.</HI>—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ah grace, au bon Dieu; quoi, Monsieur,
quoi?</HI>"</Q>—Mr. Berkeley said he would shew it them. But he went
too far, there was not a French Common Prayer Book to be procured in
<PB N="cccliv" REF="366"/> Hastings. He therefore most amiably took his pen,
and translated the whole of our delightful burial-service into French for
them, excepting the Lesson and Psalms, which he shewed them in his
Greek Testament and Latin Bible. <PB N="ccclv" REF="367"/> They were in
extacies with it. They wished to attend the Marquis to the grave; but feared,
as the French <HI>ever</HI> did, being knocked down by the <HI>English.</HI>
Mr. Berkeley assured them, the English were not <HI>such</HI>
savages. But all in vain <PB N="ccclvi" REF="368"/> was his rhetoric, unless
Monsieur <HI>Berquelée</HI> would
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>avoir la bontée</HI>"</Q> to walk at their head,
as <HI>chief</HI> mourner for <HI>le cher Marquis;</HI> which, by the
undertaker's omitting to bring a cloak, he did in his <HI>Royal Archer's
coat.</HI> In a letter to his mother, he says,
<Q REND="inline">"Do think of <HI>your</HI> son, marching in pro∣cession
at the head of three hundred French Priests, as chief mourner to a poor
persecuted French Noble!"</Q></P>
<P>The elegant accomplished Bishop of (the Editor thinks)
Avranches, on quitting the house of a very respectable
clergyman, who kindly received and entertained him, and
requested Mr. Monck Berkeley to visit and converse with him,
the gentlemen not speaking French, his gratitude to Mr.
Berkeley, for what his Lordship termed his <HI>etonante bonté</HI> to
his poor brethren, and exquisitely polite attentions to him∣self,
he declared himself at a loss for words to express.
He conjured Mr. Berkeley, when things were again settled
in France, that he would visit him at his palace. Alas!
thou elegant amiable Prelate—thou wilt probably visit
Paradise before thou doest Paris,</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley often mentioned with pleasure the worthi∣ness
and propriety of many of the three hundred clergy.
Not a man would receive a shilling who had brought any
money with him: others, who had friends in town, would
only take barely enough to defray the expence of their
journey to London.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclvii" REF="369"/>
Had the Editor time to look over her Son's letters, she
would give his account of the landing of the good old Curate
of Dieppe, aged 84; the farewel between him and his flock
of sailors. The Editor remembers, Mr. Berkeley says, <Q REND="inline">"There
was not, I believe, <HI>one</HI> dry eye, English or French, on
the shore. The good old Pastor is now gone to London.
I have the delight of thinking, that GOD will go with
him <HI>wherever</HI> he goes."</Q></P>
<P>But to return to the subject of dancing, in which the
young Laird of Kincaldrum has been already noticed. How
delightfully do the Scotch dance every thing but a mi∣nuet!
The first time the Editor saw her Son (esteemed
a very good dancer, having learned in England and
in France for ten years <HI>de suite</HI>) dance a country-dance
and cotillon in Scotland, it turned her quite sick. She
thought he danced like a ploughman, until some mi∣nuets
were attempted between the country-dances;
which a little consoled her. The next morning she
requested Mr. Berkeley to let her treat him with a
master, that he might learn to dance like a Scotch∣man.
The offer was gratefully accepted; and the very able
Mr. Jenkins attended Mr. Berkeley every day, greatly
to the improvement of Mr. Berkeley, as has been above
mentioned, and exceedingly through his kindness, to
the finances of Mr. Jenkins, who, just before, or soon
after, Mr. Berkeley quitted St. Andrews, by his wise
<PB N="ccclviii" REF="370"/>
advise, migrated to London, where he attended, by Mr.
Berkeley's recommendation, many young persons of high
rank and fashion.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley made it a point, when at Oxford, and the
Temple, to spend every Christmas vacation with his Pa∣rents.
They, although the house in the Oaks was not <HI>pe∣culiarly</HI>
calculated for a ball<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet, by the clever contrivance of Mr. Monck Berkeley, ever fruitful in expedients, twenty couple used to dance, get negus and cakes in the eating∣room, and eat their soup, and <HI>petit soupé,</HI> in Mr. Monck Berkeley's sitting∣room up stairs; which occasioned Lady D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> one day asking Dr. Berkeley, when in town, <Q REND="inline">"Has Mrs. Berkeley any room, in her house at the Oaks, that <HI>I</HI> have never seen?"</Q> By removing all the furniture, side-board, &amp;c. ten couple danced two dances—then ten more.</NOTE>, could not bear the idea of
Mr. Berkeley's dancing at many of their neighbours' houses,
and not seeing them in return. The house could not hold all
their numerous acquaintance in and about Canterbury; so
of <HI>Dames d'une certaine age,</HI> as the French speak of a middle∣aged
lady, none were invited to cards but the mothers,
and of course the fathers, of dancing-young-ladies; Mrs.
Berkeley, saying, like the old father mentioned by Mr.
Addison in the Spectator, that <HI>she</HI> did not feel it right to
invite young ladies to be made WHIRLYGIGS, without in∣viting
their natural, their <HI>best chaperons,</HI> their mothers, to
attend them. One year a most throughly respectable lady<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late amiable, throughly pious Mrs. Wadham Knatchbull—excellent woman! She has <HI>now</HI> met Mr. Berkeley in a gayer place than a ball-room. May those who loved them here, strive to join them in the realms of bliss!</NOTE>
<PB N="ccclix" REF="371"/>
said to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I have a great favour to re∣quest
of you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"You may command me, Madam."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"It is, that you will permit me to come to your house
next Tuesday, for one hour. I do not wish you to in∣vite
me to the ball, or the card-party; I know you <HI>cannot</HI>
do it; but I hear so much from every body of Mr.
Berkeley's wonderfully fine dancing, that I do long to <HI>see</HI>
him dance; and I never go to any assembly, so that I
have no chance but your admitting me for one hour.
I will <HI>not</HI> stay any longer, say what you will, I am re∣solved."</Q></P>
<P>The very worthy Dr. Lambe, Prebendary of Worcester,
became Principal of Magdalene Hall not long after Mr.
Berkeley's entering there. He happened to be in the hall
when Dr. Lambe arrived; and most of the other mem∣bers
were absent. Mr. Berkeley instantly waited on his
new superior, and with his usual polite benignity offered
his services in every way in which they could be useful.
The Editor recollects to have heard her Son say, that,
after certain necessary things performed, and dinner ended,
the new Principal asked Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"if they ought not
to go to chapel?"</Q> to which Mr. Berkeley replied in the
affirmative, <HI>if</HI> they could get a reader, and muster a con∣gregation.
The Editor thinks it was either the com∣mencement
or the end of the term, and that there was
only one member in the Hall besides Mr. Berkeley, who,
<PB N="ccclx" REF="372"/>
she thinks, was the very worthy amiable, now Reverend,
Mr. Sloman, a beloved, respected friend of Mr. Berkeley's,
who has frequently delighted the Editor by saying, <Q REND="inline">"that
he conceived he owed his life to Mr. Berkeley, as did
many other gentlemen at the same time."</Q></P>
<P>A party of gentlemen, many of them members of the
Hall, had agreed, that on the first fine day they would sail
down the river some miles—the Editor does not recollect
to what place, but thinks it was to Godstow Abbey. The
party consisted of eleven; and Mr. Berkeley, ever delight∣ing
to give pleasure to young and old, begged to take with
him a lad, son to a lady, a relation of his Mother's, at
home for the holydays. Accordingly, on Easter Monday
they set out; when they had sailed two or three miles,
some accident happened to the boat; the waterman saw it
coming, and threw himself out; for which Mr. Berkeley
always, when mentioning it, styled him a sad villain, add∣ing,
<Q REND="inline">"He left the whole number to perish, for <HI>he</HI> did not
know that any of us could swim."</Q> The boat instantly
overset; only two of the party could swim, Mr. Pearce,
nephew to the late Bishop of Rochester; and Mr. Monck
Berkeley; being both Eton men, they were good swim∣mers,
and soon escaped to shore, when Mr. Pearce
humanely said, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, we must try to save them
all. Let us go in instantly."</Q> To which Mr. Berke∣ley
replied, <Q REND="inline">"If we do, we are dead men, Pearce. No,
<PB N="ccclxi" REF="373"/>
we must wait till they are more spent, or they will in∣fallibly
cling so fast, that they will sink us."</Q> This wise
advice was followed. Mr. Berkeley first rescued his little
kinsman, as considering himself in some sort responsible
for him, as a lad of eleven years old, of whom he had
taken the charge. After some little time, Mr. Pearce and
Mr. Berkeley plunged in, and, by the blessing of God,
brought every one safe on shore. They sent to Oxford for
coaches, and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched
cloaths, Mr. Berkeley immediately wrote to his Mother,
assuring her, that whatever lamentable history the newspa∣per
might happen to make of it, by the mercy of God, he
had still the happiness to be able to subscribe himself her
dutiful Son, &amp;c. His attentions to the feelings of his
Mother, <Q REND="inline">"for an only Son,"</Q> were incessant. The Editor
had, from his youth, told Mr. Berkeley, that, if he should
be expelled from Eton, or get his name entered in the
Black Book at Oxford, she was very sure that she should
lie down and die of grief, as she and he verily believed
she would have done. He would frequently through life
say, <Q REND="inline">"If I do so, or so, I shall kill my Mother."</Q> He
is receiving his blessed reward. It may perhaps be said,
by those who were intimate in the family, that Mrs.
Berkeley was a kind, obliging Mother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor bred up by her mother with an aversion to affectation of <HI>every</HI> sort or kind, and instilling the same aversion into her son; they never compli∣mented each other, by the poor humble, now <HI>humbled</HI> title of <HI>Mr.</HI> and <HI>Mrs. Berkeley,</HI> when speaking to each other, or of each other, or to those who were acquainted with them; the Editor always telling her Son, that, until <HI>his Fa∣ther</HI> had <HI>stood</HI> behind a <HI>counter,</HI> she should never call him any thing but Berke∣ley, or Monck; for, were she to live to see him Lord Chancellor, his <HI>name</HI> would be Berkeley. If, in a large company of friends, Mr. Berkeley spoke two or three times to his Mother, and she did not attend to answer him; he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well Madam, if you do not listen to me, I protest, I will call you <HI>Mrs. Berke∣ley;</HI> and that, <HI>I am sure,</HI> will make you mind me."</Q> The Editor's sensible, agreeable friend, and <HI>quondam</HI> neighbour, Admiral Sir G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, pursues the same plan with his throughly worthy Lady; frequently saying, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, she wont mind me, I may call Nanny till I am hoarse; I'll say Lady Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, and you'll see she'll listen to me in a minute."</Q></NOTE>. She laboured
<PB N="ccclxii" REF="374"/>
to be such after the time ceased when she was to
be held up to Mr. Berkeley <HI>in terrorem,</HI> that is, when
he grew up to be a fine sensible youth, when, Solo∣mon
tells us, <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>word</HI> enters more into a <HI>wise</HI> man,
than a thousand stripes into a <HI>fool.</HI>"</Q> A <HI>very tight</HI>
rein in early youth, <HI>no</HI> rein at all after a certain period; <HI>no</HI>
influence but what arises from friendship. The Editor
never could conceive, that if a young man, or young wo∣man,
chose to live single till thirty years old, or till twen∣ty-five,
or under, that God, speaking by MOSES, or by
St. PAUL, <HI>meant</HI> they should be treated as at thirteen or
fourteen. The Editor has repeatedly observed that <HI>Irish</HI>
parents are <HI>very</HI> apt to suppose, that their authority is to
continue to the <HI>end of life.</HI> The Editor, in early youth, ad∣mired
and revered the conduct of that wise, worthy Lady,
the Duchess of St. Alban's, who, on her amiable daughter,
that humblest, sweetest of women, Lady Diana Barrington,
<PB N="ccclxiii" REF="375"/>
first Lady of the very amiable Bishop Barrington, com∣pleting
her twentieth year, thus addressed her, <Q REND="inline">"My dear
Lady Dy, from this day we cease to be <HI>mother</HI> and <HI>daugh∣ter.</HI>
We commence beloved friends. When you wish
to go into public, if I am able, I shall be happy to at∣tend
you; if not, you have many friends who will."</Q>
Her <HI>wise</HI> (very early wise) Grace, as the Editor has fre∣quently
heard her mother relate, and Lady Dy, ever after
lived as most affectionate sisters.</P>
<P>One of the Magdalene Hall gentlemen, of the party who
had escaped, being congratulated by the Principal, some of
them said, <Q REND="inline">"We meant to have gone yesterday, but Berke∣ley
would not be of the party, <HI>because it was Sunday,</HI>"</Q>
meaning to divert the Principal at Mr. Berkeley's expence.
That worthy gentleman replied, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I honour</HI> Mr. Berkeley
exceedingly for it. <HI>I</HI> wish <HI>all</HI> paid the same reverence
to the Lord's Day; it would be well for them; and <HI>they</HI>
will wish it some time hence."</Q></P>
<P>The dear excellent Bishop of Norwich used to say
to Dr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"We all say, that Mr. Berkeley is Princi∣pal
of Magdalene Hall; and <HI>a very good Principal</HI> he is.
Dr. Lambe's own good sense makes him admire Mr.
Berkeley's good judgement and propriety, so much, that
we all tell him he may do whatever he pleases."</Q> Mr.
Berkeley certainly used this delegated power most respect∣fully
<PB N="ccclxiv" REF="376"/>
to his excellent governor, and wisely, at least, in <HI>one</HI>
instance. At the time of his entering, every Gentleman-Commoner's
dinner cost him every day <HI>three shillings and
six pence.</HI> Mr. Berkeley, although generous as a prince,
was a very good oeconomist; he enquired, and found, that
at no other Hall or College any thing like that sum was paid,
he immediately set himself to rectify it, made all the ne∣cessary
proper enquiries, then applied to the worthy Prin∣cipal,
who felt the force of Mr. Berkeley's reasonings, and
summoned the Provider of these costly slices of beef and
mutton before him, who declared, (meat not then at the
frightful price it is now, on Holy Thursday, the 5th of

This great Man is King of the place, and once a week makes a pompous feast to all his numerous depen∣dents. Another butcher <HI>attempted</HI> setting up; but the poor people say, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! but Muster ******* would not suffer it."</Q> Most villages have a Tyrant; it is generally the <HI>baking</HI> Meal-man.

to furnish the dinners in the Hall cheaper, without <HI>ruin∣ing
himself.</HI> Mr. Berkeley, being present, said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That</HI>
<PB N="ccclxv" REF="377"/>
would be a <HI>cruelty,</HI> which he was sure the gentlemen of
the Hall would be exceedingly sorry for."</Q> Then turning
to the Principal, he told him, <Q REND="inline">"that, apprehending Mr.

to the reduction, he had applied to a person, who would
be very glad to supply the gentlemen every day with a
good dinner at one shilling <HI>per</HI> head."</Q> On hearing this,
the <HI>honest</HI> Provider begged <HI>some time</HI> to <HI>consider</HI> of it, whe∣ther
it would be <HI>possible</HI> for him to do it or not. Mr.
Berkeley, a pretty tolerable accomptant, said, <Q REND="inline">"The calcu∣lation
would be easily made;"</Q> and requested the wor∣thy
Principal, that it might not be long delayed, as, not∣withstanding
his father's generosity in giving him a large
allowance, he knew there were several gentlemen who felt
the pressure of this heavy daily <HI>sconce</HI> very inconvenient to
them, as well as himself. The <HI>honest</HI> man returned at the
time appointed, to the Principal's lodging Mr. Berkeley,
by appointment being present; when he said, <Q REND="inline">"That, al∣though
he should <HI>lose</HI> much by it, yet, as he <HI>had</HI> served
the Hall, (he might have added <HI>so well,</HI>) he did not care
to give it up, and would accept the terms offered."</Q> For
this service every gentleman of the Hall acknowledged that
they were indebted solely to the wisdom, spirit, and acti∣vity
of Mr. Berkeley—all complained <HI>aloud;</HI> but he <HI>alone</HI>
attempted to redress the grievance.</P>

The good Bishop of Norwich, then Dean of Canterbury,
always coming at the two audits, towards the end of June
and November, Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley used of course to
enquire when their Son talked of visiting Canterbury; to
which that facetious, witty, as well as wise, amiable man
once replied, <Q REND="inline">"Come hither! I don't know that he can
<HI>come at all.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Not come at all! What do you mean, my
dear Mr. Dean?"</Q></P>
<P>Bp. of Norwich.—<Q REND="inline">"Why I don't know how Magdalene Hall

<P><PB N="ccclxvii" REF="379"/>
This accomplished gentleman, of an ancient family, had
very nearly run through a large fortune in dissipation,
and, alas! vice. He felt <HI>too</HI> pungently his <HI>then</HI> situation;
and, contrasting it with what it might, but for his own
fault, <HI>have been,</HI> and the having involved in misery a very
worthy lady, it frequently dethroned his reason.</P>
<P>The Editor, when listening to the melancholy accounts
sometimes related to her, by her compassionate Son, of
this gentleman, has thought of what the wits of that day
said of the Bishop of Peterborough's <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The very learned Dr. White Kennet, grandfather of the Reverend John and Thomas Newman, both residing on their respective livings in Essex, and of her excellent, kind, unwearied friend White Newman, Esquire, of New∣gate Street. The Editor wishes it were possible for her to do justice to the gratitude she feels for the incessant unwearied assistance she receives from that throughly worthy friend, and his two obliging amiable sons, Messrs. White and Thomas Newman. The very grateful father of Mr. Newman, knowing that his father-in-law, the Bishop, owed all his preferment to Mr. Cherry, and feeling himself under personal obligations to that excellent man; from their youth, charged his sons, <Q REND="inline">"as they valued a father's blessing, never to omit any opportunity that presented itself of rendering every possible service in their power, to the descendants of Mr. Cherry."</Q> The Editor has frequent occasion to tell her amiable friends in Newgate Street, that they are resolved to ensure their father and grandfather's blessing. Were the Editor a Duchess in∣stead of a poor disconsolate Widow, or their Sister or Mother, the attentions of the whole family could not be more polite, amiable, unremitting; for which that God may reward them here and hereafter, prays daily, earnestly, their obliged grateful friend. It was formerly an invariable rule with all the Bishops to deal with Mr. Newman's father—<HI>l'esprit de corps.</HI></NOTE> Funeral Sermon on

the Duke of Devonshire, <Q REND="inline">"That a man of sense could re∣pent

error of his ways, would be so much more pungently
felt, that it is an evil and <HI>bitter</HI> thing to depart from
the LORD, than one of less naturally strong, less refined
understanding could possibly do."</Q></P>
<P>Some of Mr. Berkeley's intimate friends used to say,
<Q REND="inline">"He knew how to manage <HI>every</HI> person of <HI>every</HI> descrip∣tion."</Q>
A very intimate, beloved, and respected friend
of Mr. Berkeley, a very brilliant genius, whose Elegy on
the Death of Dr. Johnson was universally allowed by all
the great judges of poetry to be superior to any published
on that occasion—this gentleman, apt sometimes to be
hipped, had been some time a close prisoner in his cham∣bers,
declaring to all his friends that he was <HI>extremely ill,</HI>
and in a <HI>very bad way.</HI> On Mr. Berkeley's arrival in town,
every common friend began lamenting the unpleasant situa∣tion
of Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"I suppose <HI>he
is</HI> really very ill."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No; he ails nothing at all."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh!
very well, then; I will cure him, I promise you, in a
few minutes."</Q> Off set Mr. Berkeley, from Harcourt
Buildings, to the King's Bench Walks. On entering, the
usual enquiries of health being made, a <HI>numerous</HI> list of <HI>ideal</HI>
maladies were mentioned, Mr. Berkeley, assuming a very
<PB N="ccclxix" REF="381"/>
solemn countenance, said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, I am ex∣ceedingly grieved to find you so <HI>very ill.</HI> To be sure,
you have sent for a lawyer, and made your will, as
I know you do not mean your heir at law should
enjoy your fine estate."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Made my</HI> WILL! my dear
Berkeley, <HI>what do you mean?</HI> Made my will! Why
then, <HI>you</HI> really think me <HI>very ill.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"To be sure I
do, <HI>very dangerously ill.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"God bless my soul, <HI>I am
not ill.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Let you and I go to the Opera directly."</Q>
Up he sprang, rang his bell, told his servant that he must
dress that minute, for that he was going with Mr. Berke∣ley
to the Opera. Accordingly Mr. Berkeley escorted him
thither in triumph, to the great joy, and no small diversion,
of his <HI>numerous</HI> friends; for he is exceedingly amiable.
The next day, in the Hall, Mr. Berkeley was complimented
on his skill as a <HI>physician.</HI> Another very ludicrous anecdote
of Mr. Berkeley's extricating the same friend from a disa∣greeable
situation, some time after this, might be related.
It is certain, that Mr. Berkeley, after he grew up a man,
never undertook the management of any difficult affair,
that he did not accomplish it to the satisfaction of all the
parties concerned. Not long after Mr. Monck Berkeley's
arrival at St. Andrew's, he went one afternoon to the shop
of the (to St. Andrew's students) well-known Mungo Dick.
To his no small surprize, it was shut up. He knocked re∣peatedly;
at length a neighbour appeared; and Mr. Berke∣ley
<PB N="ccclxx" REF="382"/>
enquired, whether Mungo was broke and run-away.—<Q REND="inline">"No
Sir, he has locked himself in, he is <HI>bating his gewd

The Editor often says, <Q REND="inline">"To suppose that our grand∣fires were all angels on earth, is a folly too great to be believed for a mo∣ment."</Q> They were, probably, the best of them, sometimes fractious, some∣times drank too much, and sometimes played them false, as in <HI>these</HI> days: but <HI>here</HI> lies the difference; <HI>our grandmothers</HI> in <HI>their</HI> affliction applied for consola∣tion and direction to some <HI>reverend,</HI> pious AGED Divine, who poured balm into their poor fretted spirits, from God's Word, applied by <HI>their</HI> wisdom; in <HI>our times,</HI> it is the fashion to apply to a smart Captain of the Guards, or to some silly, ignorant, young Peer. It were surely wise to <HI>try</HI> the old Doctor. One <HI>Scotch</HI> cousin is worth fifty <HI>English</HI> ones, as we see every day. Dr. Berkeley was very urgent with the late Lord Camden to obtain an appointment for a Scotchman, for whom he had the goodness to be interested. Lord Camden, very politely and honestly, <HI>flatly</HI> refused it in the following words: <Q REND="inline">"I should rejoice to pay attention to Dr. Berkeley; and for any <HI>Englishman I will do it.</HI> But I have many years ago sworn that I <HI>never</HI> will introduce a Scotchman into any office; for, if <HI>you</HI> introduce <HI>one, he</HI> will contrive some way or other to intro∣duce <HI>forty</HI> more cousins or friends."</Q> Would James the First have acted by a <HI>Scot,</HI> as good Queen Mary and Queen Anne did by a very worthy relation of theirs, a Mr. Holden, who was many years clerk to old Mr. Cherry, the Counsellor?

Queen Anne allowed his aged mother twenty pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> and she went to Court once in the year in her new grey gown, (she was a widow;) and her Majesty always <HI>spoke</HI> kindly to her, and called her Cousin HOLDEN. The Queen was <HI>not</HI> a SCOT.</NOTE>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"To be sure

Sir, so men always lock their doors, that nobody
may ever <HI>say</HI> they have <HI>seen</HI> them <HI>do it.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley
called aloud, and vowed vengeance if he did not leave off
beating her. Mr. Berkeley went the next day, and gave
him <HI>such</HI> a <HI>lecture,</HI> as prevented his chastizing her again
during Mr. Berkeley's <HI>séjour</HI> at St. Andrew's. On the Edi∣tor's
asking her Son, if he thought he would mind what
such a youth as he could say? Mr. Berkeley replied, very
<PB N="ccclxxi" REF="383"/>
seriously, <Q REND="inline">"I <HI>hope he</HI> will, for I made him heartily ashamed
of himself."</Q></P>
<P>At the age of nineteen, Mr. Berkeley had the honour
of being elected a corresponding member of the Society of
Antiquaries in Edinburgh, in consequence of a very accu∣rate,
sensible account, transmitted to that Society, of a cu∣rious
quarry of marble, discovered some years ago in the
heart of the Highlands. It had some curious particularities,
but of what nature they were the Editor does not recol∣lect:
probably they were not understood by <HI>her,</HI> although
so excellently investigated and described by her Son. She,
however, means to present that Society with a valuable
antique in her Son's collection.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxii" REF="384"/>
Mr. Berkeley was a member of the Royal Archers; and
during the war in 1783 a number of Scotch gentlemen of
rank and fashion formed themselves into a corps. The Editor
thinks they were styled The Royal Edinburgh Volunteers.
Mr. Berkeley accepted a commission. They were sum∣moned
once, if not more, to assist in quelling a riot, the
mob being employed in demolishing some mills, when
flour was little more than half its present price. This oc∣casioned
a gentleman's asking Mr. Berkeley if he had
thoughts of going into the army; on which he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir; I am much indebted to the wisdom of my Fa∣ther,
who would not suffer me to enter on a military or
naval life, when I was a boy leaving Eton. There is but
one thing <HI>now</HI> that can ever make a military man of me,
his Majesty's erecting his standard, when I should feel it
my bounden duty to repair to repair to it."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, in the year 1789, visited the, accidentally,
native country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bp. Berkeley's father was, as well as all his ancestors, born in England. His grandfather, as before mentioned, expended a large fortune in the service of King Charles the First, and in remitting money to King Charles the Second and his brothers. The only return was making his son, the Bishop's father, collector of the port of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> in Ireland, a more respectable post than in England, noblemen's sons often accepting it. This occasioned the old gentle∣man's leaving his <HI>malediction</HI> on any descendant of his, who should ever, in <HI>any way,</HI> assist <HI>any</HI> Monarch.</NOTE> of his renowned grandfather. The atten∣tions
Mr. Berkeley received in that kingdom from all ranks
<PB N="ccclxxiii" REF="385"/>
and degrees must have been exceedingly flattering to any
man less humble than Mr. Berkeley, who, in a letter to his
Mother, speaks thus, <Q REND="inline">"I am indebted to my grandfather
for this honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Provost and Fellows of Dublin College did him the honour of con∣ferring on him the degree of LL.B. an honour never before conferred on so young a man, not educated in that University; of which <HI>great</HI> favour Mr. Berke∣ley and his Parents ever retained a most grateful sense. The Survivor means to shew her sense of it in something more solid than words.</NOTE>. I have little merit of my own; <HI>but
I</HI> am the grandson of Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erkeley, the representative
of Archbishop Usher<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bp. Berkeley was nephew to Archbishop Usher, as was his cousin-german General Wolfe. Mr. Monck Berkeley, when a very little child, one day flew up stairs to his aunt, burst into her room, crying, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! Madam, Miss Frinsham if you <HI>will</HI> have the goodness to lend me a shilling; here is a man below, with a <HI>box at his back,</HI> that <HI>says</HI> he will shew <HI>me</HI> the death of <HI>my own poor dear</HI> cousin <HI>Cardinal Wolsey,</HI> killed at Quebec fighting for <HI>this</HI> country."</Q>—When the fit of laughter brought on by this <HI>philippic</HI> ceased, the purse was pro∣duced, and the little man flew off in extacies.</NOTE>. I hope I feel as I ought the
honour conferred upon me, and trust, that although
I cannot <HI>equal,</HI> I shall <HI>never disgrace,</HI> my famous ances∣tors."</Q></P>
<P>That Mr. Berkeley should meet with much attention in
the hospitable polite kingdom of Ireland, celebrated, as
well as her sister kingdom, for pleasing conduct to strangers,
is not to be much wondered at, his Father having the ho∣nour
to be related to many of the noblesse of Ireland. His
<PB N="ccclxxiv" REF="386"/>
gratitude was great for the throughly amiable polite atten∣tions
of the excellent Marquis and Marchioness of Water∣ford.
His Parents felt it as it merited. The survivor still
feels it, as she does the very worthy Lord John Beresford's
amiability, for so condescendingly interesting himself in
her intricate affairs in Ireland. She must ever retain the
most grateful sense of the exquisitely polite condescension of
the excellent Lady Isabella Monck, the highly respected
mother of the Marchioness, ever since she had the honour
of being connected with her Ladyship by her union with
Dr. Berkeley. That excellent lady once taking leave of the
Editor, on her quitting England, spoke as follows: <Q REND="inline">"As
I fear, Madam, that there is little chance of my ever
having it in my power to pay you the respect that I wish
to do in Ireland, and that your very great attention to <HI>all</HI>
Dr. Berkeley's relations I am sure demands; I beg that,
if ever you have any relation or friend that visits Dublin,
you will be pleased to let me know, that I may at
least have the pleasure of paying them the attentions,
that I should be happy to pay <HI>you</HI> there."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor trusts that she felt this amiable conduct as it
merited. She availed herself of this goodness but once
(it is not to be supposed that she would introduce every
country gentleman's daughter of her acquaintance, who,
being smitten with a red coat, followed the camp to Ire∣land)
when the sensible, elegant Miss D'Oyley, daughter
<PB N="ccclxxv" REF="387"/>
of the late Sir Thomas D'Oyley, married Dr. Newcombe,
then Bishop of Ossory: the Editor wrote to her Ladyship,
requesting permission to introduce Mrs. Newcombe, who,
added to her great personal merits, was descended from
one of the most antient families in England. On Mrs.
Newcombe's arrival in Dublin, to the amazement of all the
<HI>ton</HI> world of Dublin, her Ladyship visiting very few persons
but of her own family and connections, and making <HI>no new</HI>
acquaintances at all of any rank she immediately ho∣noured
Mrs. Newcombe with a visit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sensible Lady of the learned Bishop of Ossory soon learned enough of Dublin to know, that to be visited by Lady Bell Monck was a greater honour than to be visited by the Viceroy's Lady, a <HI>rarer</HI> honour than to be visited by the Lady she represents.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Editor had the pleasure of adding much <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So much, that Mrs. Berkeley almost dreaded to see any of their common friends, they being reiteratedly <HI>charged</HI> to repeat and re-repeat good Lady D'Oyley's most grateful acknowledgments.</NOTE> to the
happiness of that excellent incomparable woman, the late
Lady D'Oyley, whose whole life, from the age of seven∣teen,
when she married the worthy Sir Thomas D'Oyley,
was one continued uninterrupted journey in the path of
duty<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">On Miss D'Oyley's marrying into another Kingdom, she said to an intimate friend of hers and the Editor's, <Q REND="inline">"I have never lived for myself at all since I was seventeen years old,"</Q> the time of her marriage.</NOTE>. She lived, alas! to lose the only child she ever had.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxvi" REF="388"/>
The Editor, visiting her not long before her death, found
her, as ever, resigned and cheerful, much wishing Mrs.
Berkeley to see, what <HI>she wished,</HI> a strong resemblance
between her fine little grand-daughter, about seven years
old, and her departed mother. There certainly was a re∣semblance.
Miss Newcombe was handsomer than her ele∣gant
mother. This young lady is lately married in Ire∣land,
and, it is said, means to prove her claim to what the
Editor has always heard from her youth, that her mother,
of course herself, had an undoubted right to, after the
death of her two uncles, Sir John and Sir William, both
dead childless—the barony of Hook Norton in Oxfordshire;
as, the late Lord Dacre used to say, a clergyman on a small
living in the vale of Berkshire, whose name the Editor does
not recollect, had to that of Berners. How much wiser are
the Scots, in many instances, than the English; every al∣manac
has the list of dormant titles, with this wise addi∣tion,
<Q REND="inline">"The representative of this family is <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> 
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q> Surely this is very wise; for an ancient
hereditary title is certainly no <HI>unpleasant</HI> thing for <HI>any</HI>
family to possess, however Nabobs, Slave-merchants, and
upstarts, may AFFECT to deride it in <HI>words,</HI> for in actions
they do not, being very fond of uniting their plebeian
blood with noble. The Editor will not say, as Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> 
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> said on a match made some time ago, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! he
has, I find, taken a <HI>Rag of Quality.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxvii" REF="389"/>
The excellent Lady D'Oyley took great pains to make a
very happy match for her eldest brother, a very worthy
gentleman of large fortune in the West of England, with a
very sensible, most highly accomplished young Lady, with∣out
any fortune. This noble, disinterested Lady lived to
see the lovely, the only offspring of that marriage, the first
lady of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Cresswell, Esquire, Member of Parliament
for Cirencester, left an orphan by the death of both parents
before she was two years old, a beloved friend of the Edi∣tor,
grow up; adorned with every thing that could render
an uncommonly fine, wonderfully strong understanding cul∣tivated
to the height by her maternal aunt, her <HI>more</HI> than
mother—she had in fact been a more than mother to her
half-sister, the young lady's mother, ten years younger than
herself—the excellent Mrs. Woodford; who died in April
1795, in very advanced age, at the seat of her other niece,
the amiable worthy Lady Guise, at Highnam Court, in
Gloucestershire, full of days and full of piety. The Editor
laments that it is not in the power of her <HI>feeble</HI> pen to do
justice to the very rare merits of this wonderfully wise
accomplished, excellent friend, nor to her own great gra∣titude
to her, and to God, for having put it into the
heart of this excellent lady to attach herself to the Editor
(fifteen years younger than herself) when a girl of ten
years old. She had, however, then sense enough to listen
to the <HI>wise</HI> advice of this extraordinary lady, as to an oracle
of wisdom and prudence, and continued to do so, until she
<PB N="ccclxxviii" REF="390"/>
bade her adieu for the last time, in 1792, at Highnam Court;
trusting to meet again, when the Editor hopes to be as wise
as her ever respected beloved friend. Her powers, with
regard to the education of young women, were so highly
esteemed by the Editor, that she had conjured Dr. Berke∣ley
to promise her, that, should she die leaving a young
daughter, her highly respected friend, Mrs. Woodford
might have the direction of her education, rather than her
own excellent Sister, whose exquisite compassion for a mo∣therless
child would have caused her to humour such an
one in every thing she wished, and have <HI>so</HI> ensured a <HI>mi∣serable</HI>
life, a <HI>melancholy</HI> death for her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor is to this day sometimes reproached by her too tender-hearted Sister, of not having <HI>sufficiently humoured</HI> her children. She always delighted to gratify them in every thing proper, and not injurious, ever wishing to make her dog and cats happy. Another female friend used to accuse the Editor of not treating her children like <HI>rational</HI> creatures, <HI>her</HI> word being a <HI>law,</HI> without assigning to <HI>them</HI> any reason, why they were to go, or not to go,—to stay, or not to stay, &amp;c. to which the Editor's reply was, <Q REND="inline">"ARE children of three to thirteen years old rational creatures?"</Q> That they have reason, often <HI>fine</HI> strong reason—but that does not imply that they are always rational creatures—<HI>vide</HI> half the grown up children that one sees in the world. She has, how∣ever, the delight of having <HI>both</HI> her children bear testimony to her <HI>wisdom</HI> in that instance, her eldest particularly, as has been mentioned elsewhere in this Preface. The Editor's <HI>horrors</HI> of deceit and cunning made her always resolve, that, if ever she was blessed with children, they should not be taught to tell lies, as children are, when bid to say, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>they do not know which they love best, Papa or Mamma.</HI>"</Q> Unless they are fools, they must, and do, <HI>very early know;</HI> and the Editor always ordered them to tell the truth boldly. The youngest al∣most adored his dear Father, who never contradicted him, but humoured him as much as might be, without destroying <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>authority</HI> of the Mother over the sons,"</Q> as speaks the Scripture, which says, <Q REND="inline">"God has confirmed the autho∣rity,"</Q> &amp;c. He loved his Mother exceedingly. One evening, coming in from play, he sprung into her lap, threw his arms round her neck, and began caressing her; she said, <Q REND="inline">"Robert, tell me whom you love best in the world."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, <HI>you.</HI>—Stop, Mamma; as a child, whilst one <HI>is</HI> a <HI>child,</HI> it is <HI>natural</HI> to love those best that humour one and spoil one a <HI>little;</HI> so I love Papa best. <HI>But,</HI> if I should live to be a <HI>man,</HI> I shall then love you a <HI>vast</HI> deal the best, for having never humoured me, or spoiled me at all."</Q> This is set down <HI>verbatim,</HI> as if delivered upon oath.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxix" REF="391"/>
Last year, a very short time before the death of this
revered friend, the Editor had the real pleasure to
become acquainted, under the throughly hospitable roof
of her very excellent, amiable, kind, old friends, the
very learned, sensible Recorder of Canterbury and his
sensible worthy Lady, with the amiable, very highly
cultivated, and accomplished Miss G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d, neice of
Mrs. Robinson, to whom the Editor has been much
indebted, for introducing her to the knowledge of a
very worthy man, who has been of great service to
her in some of her difficult, unpleasant busineses. This
young lady one day asked Mrs. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"if <HI>she</HI> was not
acquainted with Mrs. Woodford?"</Q> The Editor replied,
that <Q REND="inline">"she had that felicity very early in life, and esteemed
it one of the numberless gracious vouchsafements of PRO∣VIDENCE,

<P>On Dean Swift's introducing Mr. (afterwards Bp.) Berkeley
to the then Earl of Berkeley, it was in this singular way:
<Q REND="inline">"My Lord, here is a fine young gentleman of your family. I
can assure your Lordship, it is a much greater honour to
<HI>you</HI> to be related to him, than it is to him to be related
to you."</Q> The Earl of Berkeley was then Lord High
Admiral of England, the last nobleman who had that ho∣nour,
which some of his descendants pleaded as the cause
of their great pride—some of the uncommonly sensible
grandsons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley. A person,
whose name was not originally Berkeley, one day talking to
one of the most amiable of those brothers, said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear
C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, what is the cause that <HI>you</HI> BERKELEYS are so
<HI>diabolically</HI> proud? Is it because, for its great antiquity, no
noble family in <HI>England</HI> has had quite so many h<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ts
and s<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ls in it?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Madam, no; it is
because we are so horridly poor. We are afraid of being
trampled upon."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Never fear that, my dear C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>;
no man of so ancient, so noble a family as yours has
cause for such apprehension from persons of sense, if it
is not <HI>his own</HI> fault."</Q> St. Paul, speaking by the Holy
Spirit to Timothy, says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Let no man despise thee.</HI>"</Q> It is
therefore <HI>absolutely</HI> in our own power to prevent our being
<PB N="ccclxxxii" REF="394"/>
<HI>despised.</HI> It is one thing to dislike to <HI>hate,</HI> and another to
<HI>despise.</HI> The inspired Writer therefore does not say, <Q REND="inline">"let no
man hate thee, or persecute;"</Q> but <Q REND="inline">"let no man <HI>despise</HI>
thee,"</Q> is a command given from an aged to a young
Bishop. There are countries where, perhaps, the younger
Prelates might so admonish the elders to their profit. To
the admonisher of Mr. C. Berkeley, when saying, that no
persons of <HI>sense</HI> would despise him, &amp;c. might, had he
known it, have retorted the famous Dr. Rock's answer to
Sir Edward Holse, Physician to his late Majesty, who,
driving one day down the Strand, was stopped by the mob,
listening to the oratory of Dr. Rock in his gaudy equipage.
Seeing Sir Edward Hulse look out at his chariot window,
he instantly took a quantity of boxes and vials, gave them
to one of his <HI>belaced</HI> lacqueys, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Give my compli∣ments
to Sir Edward; tell him, these are all I have with
me, but I will send him ten dozen more to-morrow."</Q>
Sir Edward, astonished at the message, and effrontery of
the man, actually took them into his chariot; on which
the mob, with one consent, all cried out, <Q REND="inline">"See, see, all
the Doctors, even the King's, <HI>buy</HI> their medicines of him."</Q>
In their youth, they had somewhere been fellow students;
Rock, not succeeding in a regular way, metamorphosed
himself into a <HI>Quack.</HI> In the afternoon he waited on Sir
Edward, to beg his pardon for having played him such a
trick: to which Sir Edward replied, <Q REND="inline">"My old friend, how
can a man of your understanding condescend to harangue
<PB N="ccclxxxiii" REF="395"/>
the populace with such nonsense as you talked to-day.
Why, none but fools listen to you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Ah! my good
friend, <HI>that</HI> is the <HI>very thing.</HI> Do you give <HI>me</HI> the FOOLS
for <HI>my</HI> patients, and you shall have <HI>my free leave</HI> to <HI>keep</HI> the
people of SENSE for <HI>your own.</HI>"</Q> This anecdote of these
two different Doctors was related to the Editor by a medical
friend of great eminence, who had often heard Sir Edward
Hulse relate it to divert his friends, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I never felt so
like a fool in my life, as when I received the bottles and
boxes from Rock."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt himself much indebted for numberless
polite amiable attentions from Lord Durraghmore; for
which he was probably indebted entirely to his <HI>own personal</HI>
merit, and the great good sense of that young Nobleman,
to whom, should he chance to read this, it may not per∣haps
be unpleasant to observe, what Mr. Berkeley's Father
once said to the Editor, on her saying, <Q REND="inline">"How very lucky
Berkeley is, in becoming acquainted with so many learned
men, so much his superiors in years and knowledge!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Lucky;
to be sure he is <HI>lucky</HI> if you <HI>call it so,</HI> in having
an understanding that <HI>must</HI> make him admired by those
who have very superior understandings themselves; <HI>that</HI>
is the <HI>luck</HI> of it."</Q> They did not, perhaps, as Mr. Berkeley;
who, having dined out in a large company, at his return
asked his Mother, if she was acquainted with a young Ba∣ronet,
<PB N="ccclxxxiv" REF="396"/>
whom he named; she replied, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, that she had
known his mother very well."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> am resolved to become acquainted with
him."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Because two of the most empty fox-hunting
coxcombs I ever met with have been laughing at, and
abusing him to the company all the afternoon; so <HI>I con∣clude</HI>
he is a man of sense and worth."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley also felt himself much obliged, as the Edi∣tor
does, by the very polite friendly attentions of his Fa∣ther's
Honourable relation Sackville Hamilton, Esquire, of
Dublin Castle. He felt himself flattered by the attentions
of the learned Reverend William Hamilton, B.D. who
presented to him his very curious entertaining work, printed
during Mr. Berkeley's residence in Ireland. In his return
from Ireland, by the way of Scotland, he made some little
stay with his amiable old intimate friend, Sir William
Morres, at his seat in the county of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (name forgot∣ten).
He could not contrive to reach the house of his
learned friend, Mr. Taylor of Noan. Several translations
from the Greek Poets of this gentleman's were published
when he was about nineteen.</P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxxv" REF="397"/>
In a letter to his Father, whilst in Ireland, he says,
<Q REND="inline">"My Grandfather and Swift are still remembered with gra∣titude
in this kingdom; by some their memory is ve∣nerated
as they merited."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley having been always told by his Father,
that Dean Swift was the introducer of his Grandfather when
he came young into England, to the learned and the great,
occasioned his, from a boy, being a great admirer of that
wonderful man, and his so zealously labouring to vindicate
his fame in the Preface to his Literary Relics from some
horridly false aspersions, and palliating his <HI>sad</HI> conduct to
Stella and Vanessa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Unless it is allowed, what the Editor herself <HI>firmly</HI> believes, from what she learned from Dr. Berkeley's very old beloved friend, Dean Delany—that both Dean Swift and Mrs. Johnson were actually the children of Sir William Temple, and the heavy tidings arrived not until the day on which the indissoluble knot was tied. Surely a <HI>Spiritual</HI> Court ought to have power to set such unfortunate persons at liberty. Some years ago the eldest son of a gentleman of great estate was exceedingly in love with an heiress of large fortune: the father threw cold water on it—the old gentleman persisted in refusing to give his consent—at length, violently urged by his son to find an objection to an accomplished, beau∣tiful, rich heiress, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"You d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d fool, the world is wide enough for you to find a wife, without marrying your own sister: that young lady is my daughter; therefore give up all thoughts of her."</Q> He did so, and married another lady. The beloved object for ever gone, Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> married the first man of large fortune that her parents recommended to her; but the loss of her first accomplished lover gave an unfortunate shock to her fine understanding. She early in life became a widow. The last time the Editor saw her, there appeared a sort of melancholy restlessness, that could not fail to distress every feeling heart that knew the cause. This lady had every thing <HI>this</HI> world could furnish, to pro∣duce happiness; two fine children, a son and daughter, both magnificently provided for. But she had not the society of the only man on earth whom she could love. She saw him happy with another. Had she learned to <HI>feel,</HI> as well as say, <Q REND="inline">"Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,"</Q> it had been happy for her; had she humbly, patiently submitted, instead of sadly murmuring, and sadly cavilling, as she used alass! to do at some parts of Scripture. But what piety was it likely should be instilled into her mind by her <HI>direfully</HI> ADULTER∣OUS MOTHER, who was not suspected until this affair of the match.</NOTE>. Mr. Berkeley was not in England
<PB N="ccclxxxvi" REF="398"/>
when that book was published; but a copy, by his order
to his bookseller, was sent to every member of his family.
On his arrival in England, he immediately paid his duty
at his Father's; and, after dinner one day, said to his
Mother, that he hoped she had received the Literary Re∣lics,
which he had ordered to be sent to her before they
were published.</P>
<P>She replied, <Q REND="inline">"that she was much obliged by his attention."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Have you redde them, my dear Madam?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"To be sure I have, my dear Child."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, and what do you think of my account
of Swift?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, with what her Son used to term <Q REND="inline">"one
of <HI>my Mother's wicked</HI> looks,"</Q> replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Son, it
has <HI>determined me,</HI> if ever I should have a <HI>desperately bad</HI>
cause to plead, to retain <HI>you</HI> for my Prime Counsel."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccclxxxvii" REF="399"/>
To which Mr. Berkeley, in a sweet melancholy voice,
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah, my dear Mother, don't say so! I have not
defended his wrong conduct: I have only said all that
my conscience would suffer me to say in extenuation of
it. You know his kindness to my Grandfather in his
youth, when he came first to England. It grieves me
that you say that <HI>I</HI> should be your Prime Counsel."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley shewed his gratitude in another instance
to Dean Swift. During his short <HI>séjour</HI> in Dublin, he dis∣covered
that the old servant, Mr. Richard Brinan, in whose
arms Dean Swift expired, was poor as well as aged: he re∣lieved
him, and ordered his Father's agent to pay him a
small sum every month, to lighten the <HI>unavoidable</HI> suffer∣ings
of old age; which <HI>needs</HI> not the aid of POVERTY, to
render it unpleasant. Dr. Berkeley continued this annuity,
as does the Editor; at least, she trusts, that the poor
man receives it, as she sees it constantly in her accounts;
she hopes, for his sake, it is not as difficult to get a small
sum paid <HI>in</HI> Ireland, as it is to get <HI>any</HI> sum out of it.</P>
<P>It has, perhaps, been before mentioned, that Mr. Berke∣ley
resembled his unworthy <HI>Mother</HI> in never forgetting a
favour received, and his lovely <HI>self</HI> in <HI>never</HI> remembering an
injury done to himself. Any done to his Father he would not
pardon, as too plainly appeared in his "Siege of Rhodes,"
<PB N="ccclxxxviii" REF="400"/>
which the Editor never saw until it was printed, or she had
certainly made it a point with her obedient Son; as in another
instance, where only themselves were concerned, not many
months before his death, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Here I stand, my dear
Madam, ready to obey whatever you shall be pleased to
command."</Q> The <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> had certainly treated
Dr. Berkeley like a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; and Mr. Berkeley ever now
and then threatened him. Dr. Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"The
man that can act as he has done, is beneath your notice;
do not soil your paper with such a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley
begged him off, on account of his worthy family, with whom
in her youth she had been acquainted. Mr. Berkeley used
to say, <Q REND="inline">"No man shall maltreat my Father whilst I can hold
a pen, any more than asperse my Mother's fame whilst I
wear a sword."</Q> Mr. Berkeley used laughingly to tell a
very intimate friend of his, <Q REND="inline">"You are so apt to boast of being
<HI>will with the ladies of all ages and all descriptions,</HI> that I
am sure the <HI>only</HI> thing that prevents your hinting that <HI>my
Mother is partial to you is, that you know</HI> I would run you
through the body immediately."</Q> Had Mr. Berkeley lived
to read the grateful mention of his Father in the <HI>curious</HI> life
of Bishop Horne, he had certainly resented it as it merits
to be resented. Dr. Berkeley was a too generous friend to
numbers, whose present pride and covetousness has quite
obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the
amiable generosity of Dr. Berkeley long since rescued them.
<PB N="ccclxxxix" REF="401"/>
HE is gone to receive his reward: THEY must in due time
follow to receive theirs.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley, in his first
nove, "The Generous Rustic," has shewn his love and gra∣titude
to the French friends of his early youth. In his se∣cond,
"The Spanish Memoirs," many of the characters are
the real ones of English and Scotch friends and acquaint∣ance.
In that of Father Alberto, the reader is made ac∣quainted
with the very sensible, highly accomplished, won∣derfully
entertaining, polite, pious, Bishop Geddes, who
had spent many years as a Bishop in New Spain, and has
often delighted the Editor, when visiting at Dr. Berkeley's,
with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate, respectful
attachment the amiable Peruvians still retain for their Inca
and his royal progeny, supplying him with fish, venison, game,
&amp;c.; and the stratagems the Spaniards were obliged to employ
to convey the then Inca from New to Old Spain, where
he is a grandee. His two sons hold considerable rank in
the King of Spain's guards; they are fine young men,
although one draws a sigh over their reversed fortune.
They are, perhaps, happier to <HI>guard,</HI> than to be <HI>guarded.</HI> The
Editor has often listened with delight to accounts of conver∣sations
related to have passed between the Inca and himself
<HI>tête à tête</HI> in old Spain, al hough the Inca is not a man of
very shining abilities, perhaps, for politic reasons, very little
<PB N="cccxc" REF="402"/>
cultivated. He was not dead to what he was, nor to what
he ought to have been.</P>
<P>This excellently wise, mild Prelate, by the great wisdom of
the then Pontiff, replaced the <HI>flaming</HI> Popish Bishop, who
presided over the Roman Catholics of Edinburgh, when the
zeal of John Knox's disciples burned down the chapel, to
the great distress of the amiable liberal Dr. Robertson, the
worthy witty Dr. Webster, father of the excellent Colonel
Webster, the agreeable Dr. Carlyle, and many other
worthy Scottish ministers of Edinburgh. On that occasion
the zealots of the party exhibited a caricature print, of
which the Editor has a copy, of Dr. Johnson's beloved
"<HI>Willy Robertson,</HI>" with the triple crown on his head, a
label, &amp;c. &amp;c. May that sensible, agreeable head be now
more suitably crowned!</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's superiority of understanding led him to
feel great gratitude for Bishop Goddes's devoting so much
of his time to Mr. Berkeley when in Edinburgh in vacation
time. He felt that it was condescension in a very learned
man of between fifty and sixty, to say to a youth of nineteen,
<Q REND="inline">"Whenever you please, Sir, visit me at all times; I shall
be most happy to see you, to give you any information
you may wish that I am capable of affording."</Q> The Edi∣tor
is aware, that persons may say, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! that was to
<PB N="cccxci" REF="403"/>
make a Papist of him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley was, early in life, made by his mother to read most of what has been well written, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> in that controversy between the Church of England and the Church of Rome. At before ninetten Mr. Berkeley was a zealous Protestant, not because his grandmother was one—to be sure he had, like Timothy, <Q REND="inline">"from a child <HI>known</HI> the Scriptures;"</Q> which <HI>poor old-fashioned</HI> St. Paul thought, and said, <Q REND="inline">"were able to make him wise unto salvation."</Q>—See St. Paul's Third Epistle to Timothy, chap. iii. verse 15.</NOTE>."</Q> Bishop Geddes very soon dis∣covered,
before he had ever seen Mr. Berkeley, only an
anonymous piece of his, without the least clue to find out
the Writer—<Q REND="inline">"This is written by a <HI>very uncommon</HI> genius
indeed, be he whom he may."</Q>—The Duke D'Arundina,
Mr. Berkeley told the Editor, was the late Earl of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>;
whom Mr. Berkeley never forgave for turning his own un∣fortunate
nephew, his brother's son, from his door. The
amiable Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, daughter of Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, told Mr.
Monck Berkeley, that the poor unfortunate young gentle∣man's
father was at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s, when his <HI>only</HI> son was
chased from the door. The Editor hopes that the young
Lady had been misinformed, as he was an highly respected
friend of Dr. Berkeley and the Editor. Alas! alas! that
parents would consider, in their anger against their perhaps
ill-educated offspring, how will this action appear to me
when I come to lie on my death-bed. God himself says,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! that they were wise, that they would consider their
latter end."</Q>—But most, so far from considering it, banish
it from their mind, lest it should make them melancholy.
This ill-fated young gentleman reached a wretched ale-house
<PB N="cccxcii" REF="404"/>
in Northumberland, and there ended his miserable mortal
pilgrimage. There is a day coming ere long, when the Edi∣tor
thinks she would, of the two, rather choose to be the
poor, very weak, shatter-brained nephew, than the sensible,
solemn, pompous uncle, who is well characterized in the
person of the Spanish <HI>Don</HI> (Duke). Oh! that parents and
near relatives, whom God has blessed with understanding,
had some compassion on those to whom he has not been so
gracious, and consider that there are very many who want
guardians through life; and the father and mother of a
shatter-brained man, or simple daughter, should look out
for a proper guardian in a wise husband or wife, like the
late Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who soon after
the death of her excellent husband, said to her very un∣commonly
sensible daughter, a very old friend of the Edi∣tor,
<Q REND="inline">"We must now cast our thoughts about for some
very sensible young lady of small fortune, who will take
your brother; or else, before we have left <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> six
weeks, either the cook or the dairy maid, whichever
has most cunning, will marry him."</Q> The plan was pur∣sued.
He lived some years a very happy respectable life,
with one of the sensible daughters of the worthy Sir
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, Bart. His son does not squander the
<HI>six thousand pounds per annum,</HI> which the wisdom of his
grandmother (esteemed a stingy woman, because she paid
her bills regularly,) rescued from <HI>Molly Dairy,</HI> and entrusted
to the wise management of Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>.</P>
<P><PB N="cccxciii" REF="405"/>
The unfortunate young man, driven from the door, was
once very desirous to have married the daughter of a clergy∣man,
a Dignitary of the Church of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, well educated,
but no great fortune. The joy of his mother on its being
prevented was so great, as to occasion Dr. Berkeley's
calling her FOOL, and saying she would live to repent it.
It is hoped she did, for she must meet her injured son at
the last great day.</P>
<P>Mention has been made before, of Mr. Berkeley's being
sent, when he was little more than six years old, to town,
to get a tooth inspected by that very honest dentist, the
late Mr. Hemmet, who happened to be out of town.
The amiable friend who took the charge of him said,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, we will go to Mr. Beardmore, or some other emi∣nent
man."</Q> To which Mr. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir;
if you please, I will go to no other; for I heard my
Mamma tell you, that Hemmet was the best; <HI>and I am
sure</HI> SHE knows; and I will go to him."</Q> This occa∣sioned
his being detained a few days longer in town; and
his wise kind host, fearing that a child, who lived all day
in the open air, might suffer in town, sent him every day
to walk in the Park with his own worthy careful valet de
chambre. This man, happening to be intimate with the
gentleman of the late excellent Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
one day, in returning from the Park, called in Berkeley
Square with Mr. Berkeley in his hand, who, of course,
<PB N="cccxciv" REF="406"/>
went into the steward's or housekeeper's room, where his
sweetly engaging manners soon so won the hearts of all
present, that they asked his kind guardian permission to
lead him up, to shew him to Lord Berkeley and the excel∣lent
Mrs. Anne Egerton. He was introduced as the little
grandson of the great Bishop Berkeley. His noble relation
was charmed with the great good sense and propriety of
the little man; and, after he had been there a short time,
his sensible guardian telling him it was time to go home, he
rose, made a very graceful bow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Berkeley followed the example of his learned Father, who, from the time that his Sons put on the habits of men, used, after dinner, to make them practise, over and over, coming in and going out of a room gracefully, say∣ing, <Q REND="inline">"Every man and woman you see is a judge of those things; therefore learn to do it like gentlemen."</Q> Dr. Berkeley and his son were both very apt scholars; and it has been repeatedly remarked to the Editor, how very gracefully both Dr. and Mr. Berkeley came into a room, as if they had both learned of the same dancing-master. They had, in fact, learnt of the same master, the learned Prelate, who was remarkably attentive to the <HI>minutiae</HI> with his Sons, as well as to their Latin, Greek, and letter-writing; always saying, <Q REND="inline">"Learn to write letters properly on all occasions. Many people may hear your letters redde, that will never hear you speak <HI>vivâ voce.</HI>"</Q> When Dr. Berkeley was a boy, about eight years old, he worried his Father to let him go out with him to some Visitation, for three or four days. The good Prelate not understanding, with all his learning, the management of boys as well as his Grandson's Mother, and having no mind his little Boy should accompany him, said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, if in these two days you can make me eight Latin verses (the Editor thinks it was) you shall go with me"</Q>—be it what it might, the Prelate knew, or thought he knew, that the poor child <HI>could not</HI> do it. Dr. Berkeley has often told the Edi∣tor, that it was what he had never done, had never been taught to do; but, wild to go this journey, he set his astonishingly quick wits to work, and pro∣duced the eight lines, or verses, in due time. On his presenting them, the Bishop exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Well, George, you have been too many for me; I did not think it possible you could have done it; but, as you have done it, I must keep my word, and so you must go."</Q> The Editor used to tell Dr. Berkeley, that "<HI>she</HI> was angry with the Bishop for being such an Aegyptian task∣master to a <HI>poor</HI> little creature; for no mortal in the house could assist him but his father. Why could he not have at once taken the beautiful little creature, or told him that he <Q REND="inline">"<HI>must not go?</HI>"</Q> Dr. Berkeley was esteemed the most ele∣gant writer of Latin of any of his contemporaries at the University, as the Editor has repeatedly heard Messrs. Hamilton, Whitaker, Bishop Horne, say. Some excellent, aged scholar, (name not recollected,) said to every one, that Dr. Berkeley's Latin speech, when he was Collector, was the best he had ever heard during his twenty years residence at the University.</NOTE> to the Lady, and then
<PB N="cccxcv" REF="407"/>
to my Lord, who, untying his purse, was presenting him
with five guineas, to buy him a fine horse, saddle, &amp;c.
at the toy-shop; Mr. Berkeley having told him, that he
had a <HI>live</HI> horse at Cookham. His worthy guardian stepped
up, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I must beg your Lordship to excuse Master
Berkeley. He must not take it. His Mamma never
suffers him to take a guinea, or a six-pence, from <HI>my</HI>
Master, when staying there for months, not even from
his Grandmother or his Aunt, telling him how <HI>shamefully
mean</HI> it is to accept money from any one but his <HI>own</HI>
Parents, when they are at hand."</Q> This injunction was
withdrawn when Mr. Berkeley went to Eton, near an hun∣dred
miles from his Father's house; that then, if any old
friend of his family called, and <HI>tipped</HI> him a guinea or two,
he might accept it; as his Father and Mother had often
<HI>tipped</HI> the sons of their friends. He then declined it, telling
<PB N="cccxcvi" REF="408"/>
his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I don't like it <HI>somehow,</HI> not having been
used to it; and John Hayes (his amiable relation) is a
good-natured fellow, and will always lend me a guinea
whenever I ask him, till I see my Father or John."</Q> A
Gentleman once expressed his astonishment to Dr. Berkeley,
that, calling at Eton, to see Mr. Berkeley, he could not
persuade him to accept money.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, having always a dread of her children's
being led to practise <HI>any</HI> meanness, of <HI>any</HI> kind, never suf∣fered
either of them to receive <HI>any</HI> sum, small or great,
from <HI>any</HI> one but Dr. Berkeley or herself: from either Pa∣rent
they were at <HI>full</HI> liberty to receive as much as ever their
<HI>eloquence</HI> could <HI>extract.</HI> The Editor, from early youth, al∣ways
declared, <Q REND="inline">"However well she might like a <HI>smart</HI> cap,
or elegant gown, that she would much rather wear an
old gown, and a rusty cloak, as she does at present, than
not pay the butcher, baker, &amp;c. every Monday morn∣ing."</Q>
The doing that, in these <HI>blessed times</HI> of <HI>plenty,</HI> is
hardly sufficient; and such is the shameful selfish covetous∣ness
of most English traders in that class, that they make
those pay to the full as much for their commodities,
who pay every <HI>seventh</HI> day, as those who do or do <HI>not</HI>
pay after <HI>seven</HI> years credit. In Scotland, the traders, al∣though
in general the rudest in the world, excepting the
Dutch; if you pay ready money, twenty pounds or thirty
pence, they always throw you back a considerable discount,
<PB N="cccxcvii" REF="409"/>
as did always the late Mr. Goodchild, the great linen-dra∣per
at Charing Cross. The Editor, when buying, at St.
Andrews, even a common chequered apron, for <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>pure auld
gewd weef,</HI>"</Q> value half a crown, has repeatedly had three
halfpenny worth of white silk, nicely folded in paper, pre∣sented
to her by the very worthy, really respectable Dean
of Guild Kaye, the first shop in St. Andrews, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Be
pleased, Madam, to take your discount; I will not bur∣den
you with halfpence."</Q> He had been long enough in
England to learn the civility of our traders, not long enough
to learn their cunning, of making those who do pay, pay
for those who do not. Whilst Dr. Berkeley's family was
at St. Andrews, they were told by several of their neigh∣bours,
that a certain Earl, who has a mansion near Perth,
one day walked in, and purchased half a guinea's worth of
tea and sugar, laid down the money on the counter, which
the grocer took, and put into the till. The Earl asked,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Where is my discount?</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">" Oh! my Lord, I thought your
Lordship had lived so much in England that you would
not take it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"NOT TAKE IT! I have not lived long
enough in England to learn their FOOLISH customs."</Q> This
nobleman is remarkable for a strong understanding; was
educated at Westminster and Christ Church College, Oxford;
and, being a most able speaker in the House, would do the
<HI>honest</HI> part of English gentry and traders an essential service,
if he could introduce this wise Scottish custom South of the
Tweed. The Editor has one Scottish friend, who resides
<PB N="cccxcviii" REF="410"/>
much in England, who constantly, when he purchases any
thing, puts the cash or notes in a paper, writes on it what
it is to pay, and constantly keeps it in his desk twelve
months, because the English traders will not allow him
discount, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that they are a set of rascals for not
doing it."</Q></P>
<P>After Mr. Berkeley grew up, some one, speaking highly,
and justly, as he deserved, of Lord Berkeley of Stratton,
Mr. Monck Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure he was a good-na∣tured
man; he would once have made me the <HI>happiest of
mortals, but for my Mother.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"How so?"</Q> Mr. Berke∣ley
then mentioned what has been related above.</P>
<P>On which Mrs. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Bless me, my dear

<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Remember</HI> it, my dear Madam; why, I never
felt such happiness before, nor ever expect it again on

back to my Lord, for that you never suffered me, &amp;c."</Q>
as before mentioned. <Q REND="inline">"I had, in <HI>idea,</HI> purchased half the
globe with those five guineas. Lord Berkeley said, I
was the grandson of a great good man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Berkeley of Stratton, and Bishop Berkeley, were extremely in∣timate in their youth. Doctor Berkeley had vast numbers of Lord Berkeley's letters to his father. A very unhappy event in Lord Berkeley's life, when a young man, occasioned <HI>all</HI> his <HI>own</HI> relations breaking all intercourse, <HI>all</HI> con∣nection with him, whilst, wonderful to relate, those of his unfortunate ill-fated lady pardoned it. One of her near relations resided entirely with him for many years before his death, the very worthy Mrs. A. Egerton, to whom he shewed his gratitude at his death. This lady resided some years at Frogmore-House, where Mr. Monck Berkeley, whilst an Etonian, and his very <HI>wonderfully</HI> sensible, clever, acute friend Mr. Kirk, nephew of Colonel Egerton's Lady, always found a most cordial reception, of which Mr. Berkeley often spoke with grati∣tude. Lord Berkeley's life, very many years before his death, had been not only exemplary, but exaltedly pious. The Editor will take leave to relate an anecdote of his Lordship and the Princess Amelia. Mrs. Berkeley happening to be staying at Lambeth Palace when Archbishop Secker related it to the late amiable Bishop Trevor, of Durham, it made so deep an impression that she can set it down verbatim.—Bishop of Durham: <Q REND="inline">"I cannot conceive what is come to Princess Emely lately: people don't usually grow <HI>better</HI> tempered as they grow old; but, from having been all her life the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (the blanks must be filled up by those who read) she is become so humble, so affable, so condescending, so kind and charitable (her Royal Highness used frequently to send Dr. Berkeley ten guineas, with a re∣quest that he would distribute it, as he thought best, amongst the poor of his parish of Acton) that it delights one to hear it; every body wonders, but nobody can tell what has caused this astonishing change."</Q> Every one at the table professed themselves glad, and contrasted it with her Royal Highness's conduct when Ranger of Richmond Park, and the odious stiles erected to deter persons from crossing it. The Archbishop, in his usual deliberate man∣ner, and in his wonted deliberate tone of voice, said, <Q REND="inline">"I can inform your Lordship what it is that has wrought this wonderful, this <HI>very happy</HI> change in her Royal Highness's manners and conduct. You know that my Lord Berkeley of Stratton is always one of her Royal Highness's select party.—One day she told him, she found that she grew old, and she wished his Lordship would recommend some good book to her to read, to make her better. His Lordship bowed, and said, 'he would endeavour to find one to suit her Royal Highness.' According the next time he went to Gunnersbury House, he took a large folio in his coach, and, carrying it in under his arm, presented it to her Royal Highness, saying, 'that he had obeyed her Royal Highness's commands, and had brought her a book that he hoped and be∣lieved she would like.' Her Royal Highness <HI>did like it,</HI> has redde it, and studied it; and that, my <HI>good</HI> Lord, is the cause of this <HI>happy</HI> change in her Royal Highness that <HI>every body</HI> is so wondering at."</Q> The Princess soon fell in love with the Prelate; which may many that are neither Princesses nor Peeresses do, who may chance, on running their eye over this Preface, to read and study that <HI>divine</HI> writer (the delight of the Editor's spirit), that <HI>true Church of England</HI> Prelate, is ardently wished by the writer of these poor pages;who, if she is the humble instrument in the hand of Providence of consoling <HI>one</HI> poor, humble, contrite penitent, male or female, or benefiting <HI>one</HI> soul, is content to be derided as <Q REND="inline">"an old fool"</Q>—a most MONSTROUS <HI>ridiculous</HI> creature!

<P>Mr. Berkeley, as well as his parents, had a most affec∣tionate

universally <HI>respected</HI> relation, Major James Berkeley, one of
the grandsons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley; whom,
on his <HI>dreary</HI> journey from Dover to Cheltenham, he was
sadly disappointed at not finding at Rochester, he being
then in barracks at Chatham, now, alas! abroad, in a
situation of great danger. May God, in mercy, spare that
best of sons and brothers to his worthy mother, elegant
sister, and to his idolizing, beautiful, accomplished lady!
<PB N="cccci" REF="413"/>
May their son, if he lives to grow up, be, <HI>if an officer,</HI> as

But they would then be Angels, and soon removed to the Celestial Choir.</NOTE>."</Q> Pro∣ceeding
on the road between Rochester and Dartford, a
post-chaise drove most furiously by the coach. Mr. Berke∣ley's
quick eye saw it, and said to Mrs. Frinsham, <Q REND="inline">"There
goes dear James and his lovely lady; I wish to speak to
him."</Q> His servant, on horseback, endeavoured to over∣take
and stop them; but in vain, for they out-stripped the
wind. He was affected, as he wished exceedingly to bid a
<HI>last</HI> adieu to his sincerely beloved, respected kinsman.</P>
<P>Major Berkeley has a younger brother, a very uncommonly
sensible man; in mind, not person, a genuine Berkeley.
On the famous 27th of July every man between himself
and the Earldom of Berkeley were engaged in <HI>actual</HI>
service. The Honourable George Berkeley, only brother
of Lord Berkeley; Captain Velters Cornwall Berkeley, of the
Navy; Major Lionel Berkeley; and Major James, above
named. Should Mr. George Berkeley marry a Lady
with a mind like his own, their offspring may discover
what is <HI>transacting</HI> in the stars discovered by Dr. Her∣schel.
<PB N="ccccii" REF="414"/>
Mr. George Berkeley has, as the Editor used to tell
Dr. Berkeley and her Son—they had eyes that could see an
insect a mile off. A learned friend of the Editor, not
short-sighted, used to say of his Lady, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>She</HI> can see a <HI>crow</HI>
upon a church-steeple when I cannot see the <HI>steeple.</HI>"</Q> It
must, surely, be very pleasant to be blessed with such eyes.
The Editor was always anxious to find out, when infants,
whether her children had their dear Father's fine eyes, or
their mother's. Both could, like Mr. George Berkeley
and their Father, see the mountains in the moon.</P>
<P>This very sensible young Divine once, when staying at
Dr. Berkeley's; the Editor, seeing him very careless of his
health, said to him, <Q REND="inline">"If you don't take more care of your∣self,
Berkeley will come to the title at <HI>last.</HI>"</Q> He briskly
replied, <Q REND="inline">"Surely, I think, there are enough of <HI>us</HI> to keep
your son from it."</Q> The Editor well remembers to have
frequently heard her very sensible, agreeable, intimate
friend, Mrs. Jones, sister to the present highly worthy, excel∣lent
Marquis of Winchester, say, that <Q REND="inline">"When he was a
little boy of five or six years old, and intimate friend of his
mother, used to say, stroking his head, 'Aye, my dear
George, this little white head of thine will one day wear a
coronet: I am old, and shall not live to see it; but, <HI>I
promise thee,</HI> thou wilt one day be Marquis of Winchester."</Q>
The present HONOUR to that very ancient title was then the
<HI>seventh</HI> from it. The manner in which his Lady's <HI>wise</HI>
<PB N="cccciii" REF="415"/>
father recommended it to her, with her vast fortune, to
marry Mr. George Pawlett, then a younger brother, does
him more honour than even his very ancient title promised
to him by the old lady. In this instance it can hardly be
urged that prescience is unpleasant; for a coronet, if honourably
obtained, is no <HI>unpleasant</HI> prediction. Yet, how merciful is
God! in hiding from his creatures the FUTURE, unless <HI>by fore∣seeing</HI>
we could <HI>prevent.</HI> How gracious was God, in the year
1760, and several subsequent years, in concealing from the
unworthy writer of these pages, she then spending from the
beginning of May to the end of September at Cheltenham,
on account of her dear sister's health, by no means in a dan∣gerous
state, which must have prevented her enjoying balls,
parties, &amp;c.—had it been made known to her, that in the year
1792 and 1793 she should pass as many months of <HI>extreme</HI>
anguish of spirit, and at length lose an <HI>only</HI> child, one of the
finest young men in England, it <HI>would, it must,</HI> have totally
destroyed her innocent mirth and <HI>gaieté de coeur</HI> enjoyed there
above thirty years before.—The Honourable Mr. Finch,
great uncle to the present Lord Aylesford, being told
by a fortune-teller, that he would die by means of a
grey horse, occasioned his living <HI>twenty-five</HI> years in
<HI>miserable anxiety;</HI> but did <HI>not</HI> prevent his being killed the
twenty-sixth <HI>by a grey horse,</HI> in a very remarkably odd
way, as some West Kent gentlemen have related it to
the Editor.</P>
<P><PB N="cccciv" REF="416"/>
Mrs. Berkeley takes this opportunity of returning her
grateful acknowledgements to many amiable acquaintances
at Cheltenham, at the time of Dr. Berkeley's long con∣finement,
after the extreme danger of his illness be∣fore
mentioned was over; who used obligingly to give
up the rooms, and afford him the pleasure of their
pleasing society; the very agreeable Miss Nevilles; the
worthy Mrs. André, mother of the amiable unfortunate
Major André, and the delightfully sensible, highly cul∣tivated
Miss Andrés; the wonderfully well-informed, pious
Mrs. Wells of Cheltenham; the Editor's old friend, the
very amiable, worthy Mr. De la Bere; the worthy Mr.
Llewelwyn; Mr. Fitzgerald, the sensible, agreeable son of
an old friend of Dr. Berkeley's; and his very learned brother∣in-law's
old friend Mrs. Boswell, sister of Lord Bellamont,
and the highly accomplished agreeable Miss Boswells.</P>
<P>After Mr. Monck Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham, little
society could be kept up; but the attentions of the worthy
Captain Abbot and his Lady at the next door, to prevent
extraordinary noise in the house or court, are gratefully
remembered; and the unwearied, polite, tender attentions
during Mr. Berkeley's short life, and the polite, tender, at∣tentions
after his lamented decease, of the very learned
accomplished Mr. Dunster, and his elegant lady, were
most gratefully felt by Dr. Berkeley, and will be for ever
registered in the retentive memory of the Editor.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccv" REF="417"/>
It has been mentioned, that Mr. Berkeley never went
out but twice at Cheltenham: he had therefore never the
pleasure of conversing with Mr. Dunster; which he la∣mented,
for he was a great admirer of his writings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some days after Mr. Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham, he one day said, <Q REND="inline">"Who is this Mr. Dunster, that you all seem to like so much?"</Q> On being told, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Mercy on me! is it <HI>that</HI> Mr. Dunster indeed, that you have <HI>got here?</HI>"</Q> So saying, he rang his bell, took out his key, and ordered his servant to bring down his poems, all then written out fair for the press. When the book came down, he desired the Editor to carry it <HI>immediately</HI> to Mr. Dunster, with the following message: <Q REND="inline">"His compliments that he had sent the manuscript volume for Mr. Dunster to peruse, on this <HI>sole</HI> con∣dition, that he would, <HI>sans cérémonie,</HI> mark whatever he thought might be amended."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley saying she would get her hat and cloak, he said, <Q REND="inline">"Best of mothers, pray go as you are; <HI>you know very well</HI> that you <HI>race</HI> all over the garden at Cookham, and down the Southcote Walk, to give your orders to the gardener, and do not catch cold; and this is only three doors."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"But the people <HI>here will think me mad.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"If they do, it will be <HI>because</HI> they are fools. Best of mothers, go <HI>for fear</HI> Mr. Dunster should be gone out."</Q> The Editor <HI>obeyed,</HI> apologizing to her polite friend, pleading her son's <HI>carnestness</HI> to learn <HI>his</HI> strictures. They were redde—were much admired—and Mr. Dunster declared that there was not <HI>any</HI> thing that could be altered for the better.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> de la Bere, Esquire, father of Mr. De la Bere,
died only a very few days before Mr. Berkeley, who felt
very sensibly the amiable delicacy of Mr. De la Bere, in
ordering only a few strokes of the knell, lest it should affect
Mr. Berkeley. Alas! it affected his relations more than
himself. He constantly enquired every day what account
had been received of Mr. De la Bere; and one day said,
<PB N="ccccvi" REF="418"/>
<Q REND="inline">"I wonder which of us God will call first."</Q> He was,
through Redeeming Mercy, as before mentioned, prepared
for that journey that ALL must sooner or later take. May
ALL who read take the advice of our adored REDEEMER,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Be ye therefore ready,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c. The invalids in the elegant
houses in St. George's Place are considerably incom∣moded
by the ringing of bells a considerable time before
service begins on Sunday morning.</P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley passed a bad night, and could have
slept in the morning, the noise so very near prevented it.
Dr. Berkeley sent to the exceedingly obliging Mr. Edwards,
one of the churchwardens, to request that they might ring
less time. He most politely sent word, that he would take
care that no bell should move through the week, only just
one bell toll five minutes before service began.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt so much gratitude for this favour so
amiably conferred, that he desired Mrs. Berkeley would call
on Mr. Edwards, and return him his best thanks.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"I have sent a message of thanks to Mr.
Edwards."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"A message, my dear Sir? No; I beg that
my dear Mother will go herself. She will say what a
message or card cannot say. <HI>She</HI> will express what <HI>I feel.</HI>
I therefore intreat that she will go."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccccvii" REF="419"/>
Accordingly, to gratify the amiable heart of her dear
Son, Mrs. Berkeley went immediately, and endeavoured to
express to the worthy Mr. Edwards how sensibly Mr.
Berkeley and his parents felt his kind amiability.</P>
<P>Mr. Edwards, the wine-merchant, had been many years
gentleman to Bishop Johnson of Worcester; whose angelic
gratitude to the relict and daughter of his earliest friend,
when reduced to poverty, can never be forgotten by any
who have heard it, and to which he, by God's appoint∣ment,
owed his wonderful rise in the Church.</P>
<P>The excellent Lady Heskett's delightful society and im∣proving
pious conversation assisted the Editor much, in
drawing off her mind from <HI>incessant</HI> meditation on the suf∣ferings
of her dearest relatives. Her Ladyship was a COW∣PER.
She is worthy to be nicee of the Editor's Mother's
excellent neighbour in Berkshire, the excellent Mrs. Madan,
mother of the present Bishop of Peterborough.</P>
<P>The poor unhappy female, the <HI>infamous</HI> Lady Vane, in
her latter days, after she had lost the use of all her limbs,
took a house in her native Country of Berks, in order to be
near a very eminent German apothecary. So extremely
was her Ladyship afraid of <HI>culinary</HI> fire, that she had a
machine made to <HI>twirl</HI> her <HI>instantly</HI> out at her window, in
case of any such accident in the night.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccviii" REF="420"/>
The Editor has been twice awakened out of a very sound
sleep to escape from fire: the last time when Wriggles∣worth's,
the great Inn at York, was on fire. She has no
machine; but her garments are regularly every night <HI>so</HI>
placed, by herself and her maid (with her at York), as to be
ready for instant flight.</P>
<P>From dread of culinary fire, as Lady Vane travelled down
the vale of years towards the <HI>cold</HI> mansion appointed,
sooner or later, for all the <HI>daughters</HI> of Adam, however
beautiful in youth, however <HI>strongly varnished</HI> in age; her
poor Ladyship began to apprehend, that one <HI>part</HI> of her
might soon be in danger of A FIRE from which NO machine
could possibly <HI>twirl</HI> her. The very worthy, witty, agreea∣ble
Mr. Henchman, Fellow of All Souls, used frequently to
ride over to Cookham, and take a family dinner at Dr. Berke∣ley's.
Some time after Lady Vane had taken her house in
Bray church-yard, he diverted all the company present by
relating a dialogue that had the day before passed between
her Ladyship and his worthy neighbour, the German
medical man, who had just told Mr. Henchman how much
her Ladyship had distressed him the day before by asking
him if <HI>he</HI> thought it possible <HI>she</HI> should be saved. The
worthy man, in broken English, said, <Q REND="inline">"Upon my vord, my
Lady, <HI>I</HI> cannot tell—should hope <HI>that—that—that—</HI>
God <HI>voud</HI> not—<HI>voud</HI> not—I did not know <HI>vat</HI> to say to

<PB N="ccccix" REF="421"/>
Your Ladyship had better ask somebody that understands
such tings better dan I do. I was quite ashamed I did
not know vat answer to make to her <HI>at all.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Hench∣man
said, <HI>I</HI> told my good neighbour, that he should have
said, <Q REND="inline">"To be sure it was <HI>impossible</HI> that the Almighty should
<HI>think</HI> of d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>g so <HI>public</HI> spirited a Lady."</Q> The Editor
greatly wished her Ladyship's Parish Minister, or some well∣instructed
Divine, to have visited her, and have shewn her,
that one gracious promise of the Saviour of <HI>great,</HI> as well
as of LITTLE sinners—<Q REND="inline">"Him (or <HI>her</HI>) that cometh unto
ME, I will no wise cast out—come unto me ALL ye, &amp;c.
&amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>She was once going to take the high house at Cookham;
but, being an <HI>absolute</HI> cripple, the structure of the stair-case
would not admit of her men carrying her chair up and
down. If she had taken it, the Editor, having no daugh∣ter,
and thereby feeling herself at <HI>full</HI> liberty <HI>to</HI> visit, <HI>or not</HI>
visit, whom she pleases, declared, to the no small amusement
of many of her friends, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>she</HI> should infallibly visit
Lady Vane."</Q> Alas, poor soul! she, like most of the chil∣dren
of Adam, was a self-deceiver, always declaring, that,
<Q REND="inline">"had her dear Lord William Hamilton lived, she had re∣mained
as chaste as Diana."</Q> The Editor <HI>knows,</HI> from too
good authority, that, for some time before the death of
that singularly amiable, worthy, young Nobleman, her La∣dyship's
conduct had made him often very wretched. He
<PB N="ccccx" REF="422"/>
was removed <HI>hardly</HI> in time for his <HI>own</HI> peace of mind.
<HI>His</HI> stay would not have prevented <HI>her</HI> sad fall. She had
run away from her <HI>proscribed</HI> father (South Sea Hawes) with
Lord William Hamilton; and the Editor has, from her
youth, delivered it as one of <HI>her</HI> maxims, that the lady
who will run away <HI>with</HI> a man, will generally run away
<HI>from</HI> him; perhaps it may be said, <HI>tant mieux.</HI> There are,
to be sure, some few exceptions to all general rules; but,
a girl of fifteen or sixteen must be a bold little wretch, to
quit a parent's house, and set off with <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that persidious
creature man.</HI>"</Q> It requires <HI>some</HI> courage to set off to the
Altar, led by a tender Parent or kind Guardian—at least so
thinks the Editor.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, descended from two men so famous
in their generation as Bishop Berkeley and Francis Cherry,
Esquire, in whose person all that was mortal of those ex∣cellent
men ended; neither having now any <HI>lineal</HI> de∣scendant
that can carry their eminent amiable virtues to
posterity. Should the Editor at any time have it in her
power to erect a monument, as Dr. Berkeley intended to
do, in Cheltenham church, by the wonderfully powerful
chissel of her worthy old acquaintance, J. Nollekins,
Esquire, the <HI>broken pillar</HI> must, alas! compose a part. It
cannot, however, be recorded that the light of those two
great men was extinguished in smoke. Blessed, for ever
praised by the mercy of God, the <HI>blaze</HI> was brighter in
<PB N="ccccxi" REF="423"/>
death than even in life. And those two excellent spirits
must have hailed with pleasure, on his arrival in the region
of happy spirits, the lovely spirit of their <HI>last</HI> descendant,
who, in one respect, a very unimportant one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our Blessed Redeemer does not appear to have thought decent funerals, and monuments to hand persons down to posterity, <HI>things wrong,</HI> when he tells his covetous Disciples, that the <HI>lovely</HI> penitent Mary Magdalen's gratitude in anointing him to his funeral should be rewarded, by being recorded in the Gospel, and so she be remembered to the <HI>end</HI> of TIME. In Isaiah God threatens a king of Judah, that he shall be buried with the burial of an ass, cast out, &amp;c. Much might be said very different from what is usually said by very pious persons on both these subjects; but time, and place, and health, are all want∣ing.</NOTE> many may

say, <Q REND="inline">"they are lamentably imperfect;"</Q> when Mr. Monck
Berkeley, as above-mentioned, used to regret Dr. Berkeley
had not permitted Dr. Johnson to write the Life of Bishop
Berkeley.</P>
<P>There are a thousand very curious, very diverting, some
very ludicrous ancedotes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bishop Berkeley retained the famous Pasquilino four years in the palace at Cloyne, to teach his children music; giving him £200 <HI>per annum,</HI> and keeping him a little chaise and pair of tolerable horses. The following ludicrous anecdote was some time ago related to the Editor by the very worthy Mr. Angello of Eton: Dr. Berkeley was esteemed the finest gentleman-performer on the violincello in England; as his brother, who died at sixteen, was a wonderfully fine performer on the violin. Bishop Berkeley had a fine concert at his own house every evening in winter when he did not dine from home. Signior Pasqui∣lino was to have a very fine concert at Cork. One day at dinner the Bishop said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Pasquilino, I have got <HI>rid</HI> of a great many tickets for you among my neighbours, to Lord Inchiquin, Lord Shannon, Mr. Lumley, &amp;c."</Q> To which Pasquilino bowing, said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>May God</HI> PICKLE <HI>your Lordship, I pray him.</HI>"</Q> All the company laughed immoderately. The poor Italian said, <Q REND="inline">"Vell, in de grammar that my Lord give me to teach me Inglish, it is printed, <HI>Pickle,</HI> to keep from decay."</Q> Bishop Berkeley most kindly invited his brother the Reverend Doctor Robert Berkeley, father of the Dean of Tuam, and Mrs. Hamilton, Lady of Sackville Hamilton, Esq. to send his seven chil∣dren, one fixed day in every week, to learn music, dancing, &amp;c. of <HI>his</HI> childrens masters.</NOTE> of that great and good Prelate,
<PB N="ccccxii" REF="424"/>
that Dr. Berkeley and his Mother used to relate of the good
Bishop even from his childhood throughly diverting. The
Editor is much addicted to watching children, before either
the masque is <HI>fitted on</HI> to hide, or grace infused to suppress
to rectify—the lamentable <HI>dose</HI> of <HI>Original Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor has more than once heard the late Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> say, <Q REND="inline">"that he often pressed a beloved friend of
his to marry."</Q> He at length said, <Q REND="inline">"I have long resolved

a race of Devils."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Of Devils, my dear Friend! Is it
probable, that any thing sprung from such an angelic be∣ing
as yourself should be Devils?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my dear Friend,
to be sure I do, for I am one myself. All that you and
<PB N="ccccxiii" REF="425"/>
many others so much admire in me is <HI>God's Grace;</HI> for I

youth before you knew me) the most ill-humoured, bad∣tempered,
malicious, diabolical being, I believe, <HI>ever
born into the world.</HI> I think I must have sprung from the

children, they will, at least some of them, inherit my
horrible temper; and as I am by no means sure that

to <HI>me;</HI> I am resolved to let my vast estate, about which

fixed. Examine the lines of my face attentively,
and you will be convinced of the truth of what I tell
you."</Q> His Lordship said, <Q REND="inline">"there appeared some lines sub∣dued
of what the excellent man asserted to be in his spi∣rit."</Q>
Every one knows how honourably Socrates justified
the skill of a famous physiognomist, who, on coming to

declared him an excellent judge, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the commencement of the hard frost in 1739-40,
the Bishop went down to breakfast the first Sunday without
a grain of powder in his wig; Mrs. Berkeley, the Chap∣lain,
<PB N="ccccxiv" REF="426"/>
and some company staying in the house on a
visit, all called out at once, to enquire <Q REND="inline">"what ailed his
Lordship?"</Q></P>
<P>Bp. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"A great deal ails me; for our poor are
all about to be starved. We shall have a famine. We
shall have a very long frost; and I am sure it has already
killed all the potatoes in this kingdom; therefore the
poor must depend upon flour; so no powder will I,
or shall any individual of my family wear, until next
harvest."</Q></P>
<P>They assured him that it disfigured him exceedingly, and
that the men would look dirty. All persuasion was vain.
He, during the frost, and until the summer, gave, either
in gold or in a bank note, every Monday morning, twenty
pounds to proper persons, to distribute amongst the poor
of the little town of Cloyne, besides what they received
daily, hourly, out of his kitchen and housekeeper's room.</P>
<P>It was a ludicrous message enough which the Bishop re∣ceived
from one old woman: <Q REND="inline">"Her duty to his Lordship,
and she was very sorry that she had not lived better."</Q>
The good Bishop sent her word, that <Q REND="inline">"he hoped she
would send for Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, (the name forgotten,) and
talk with him, and lead the short remainder of her life
differently."</Q> She returned for answer, <Q REND="inline">"that his Lord∣ship

<HI>sowle,</HI> but was sorry, as she now (in her dying state) got
such good things from his house, that she had not con∣stantly
enjoyned them before, and could enjoy them so

woman's ideas of the joys of Heaven were <HI>very</HI> low.</P>
<P>The Editor has been often told by a very intimate sensi∣ble
friend, that HER ideas of Heaven are <HI>very high,</HI> VERY
<HI>singular.</HI> Such as they are, some of her intimate friends
now and then conjure her to <HI>treat</HI> them, as they are pleased
to term it, with HER account of Heaven. She was once
brought to <HI>public</HI> shame for this <HI>private</HI> conversation; for
it is not to be supposed, that the Editor is quite fool
enough to cast her precious pearls, that seem to deck her
wings for flight to those delightful regions, before such

<P>A smart young Divine, a relation of Dr. Berkeley's, had

acquainted with the Holy Scriptures as that lady is. <HI>I</HI> fre∣quently
apply to her."</Q> The Editor has little other know∣ledge
to boast of; and <HI>that</HI> knowledge must, in <HI>every</HI> instance,

Supreme Being,) and thenceforward until this present
day; and, she humbly trusts, to the last hour of her life;
besides every day's private reading, alone, some portion of

Berkeley's noble and non-noble<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has perhaps here, <HI>selon sa coutume, coined</HI> a word, as she did many years ago when in the world. When the Honourable and worthy Mrs. Berkeley, mother of Lady Woodhouse, was living, there were frequent mistakes, although the Editor always left her cards, as it <HI>became her to do,</HI> "Mrs. George Berkeley," and always ordered her servants to announce her Mrs. George Berkeley; but, to save trouble, the <HI>ton</HI> lacqueys often dropped the GEORGE (a bad pun might here be made) in ascending the stair-case; which now and then occasioned her being received with a <HI>formal respectful</HI> face; and then—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear friend, is it you?"</Q> A gentleman once said, <Q REND="inline">"These Ladies should be announced, the <HI>Honourable,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q> The Editor ex∣claimed, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I will not be announced the Dishonourable</HI> Mrs. Berkeley; for <HI>I</HI> have never disgraced the noble name.

The Editor
does not recollect to have redde, in any of Bishop Berke∣ley's
lives, that mention is made of his <HI>utterly</HI> refusing to
inclose the great common at Cloyne, where the poor used
to cut their peat, turn their cows, pigs, and poultry; the
doing which had nearly cost the present Earl of Bristol his
life, he being obliged to be guarded out of Cloyne by an
old friend of Dr. Berkeley, Mr. Lumley of Ballymaloo Cas∣tle,
riding with a cocked pistol close to the CHARITABLE
Prelate's ear, declaring that the first man who threw a stone
<PB N="ccccxviii" REF="430"/>
was a dead man, as that gentleman's mother told Dr.
Berkeley in his drawing-room, the Editor being present.
It were to be wished that worthy-spirited gentleman, or
some as worthy and <HI>fearless,</HI> had been on the jury who
acquitted C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ld. How often has the Editor rejoiced
to hear her Son thank the goodness of God, that the <HI>said</HI>

by his episcopal grandsire!</P>
<P>No regular life of Mr. Cherry has ever been <HI>attempted,</HI>
as of Bishop Berkeley, to be written. A short sketch ap∣peared,
in 1782, in Mr. Nichols's "Leicestershire Collec∣tions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the History of Hinckley, p. 174.</NOTE>,"
where his Chaplain, the Rev. Francis Brokesby,
is mentioned. The <HI>Irish</HI> Demosthenes once did him the
honour to say, <Q REND="inline">"It is a shame, Madam, that the life of
your grandfather has not been written."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley
once met with a small diverting humiliation, on account of
being descended from that excellent man, to the no small
diversion of Dr. and Dr. Mr. Monck Berkeley. Returning
from her morning walk, clad as usual <HI>in the morning</HI> (the
Editor never wastes the <HI>morning</HI> in walking but in winter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Some years ago, when Dr. Berkeley resided at Cookham, the Editor, escorted by three elegant beaux, used generally to walk an hour and a half in the Southcote Walk, by moon or star-light, enjoying the conversation of the very learned, accomplished D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, his son S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, Esquire, and her own delightful youth, then about seventeen.

to walk after dinner for health, although it is <HI>wonderfully</HI>
beneficial for those, who, dining at a reasonable hour, at
three o'clock, can do it, as the Editor does experience,
and has seen in various persons), with a black beaver hat
tied under her chin, and wrapped round in a <HI>rather</HI> rusty
black mode cloack, she stroled into Dr. Berkeley's room,
not knowing that any one was with him. There happened
to be a person more esteemed in the world for his
great learning and true worth, than for his title and
rank in society. In the course of conversation, Mr.
Cherry was named. Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"A relation
of my wife."</Q> The visitor, probably wishing to hear
some anecdote of that excellent man, turned to Mrs.
Berkeley, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, Madam, do you know any thing
of Mr. Cherry?"</Q> supposing her, as it should seem by the
sequel, a distant relation. She replied, <Q REND="inline">"He was my mo∣ther's
father."</Q> He started astonished, and said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>What,</HI>
Madam, <HI>are</HI> YOU a grand-daughter of the <HI>great</HI> Mr.
Cherry?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley, smiling, said, <Q REND="inline">"She had that
honour."</Q> The enquirer's politeness and good sense pre∣vented
<PB N="ccccxx" REF="432"/>
his <HI>apologizing,</HI> by saying, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, I ask your
pardon; I did not conceive that such an insignificant, un∣dressed,
little being could possibly be descended from the
very handsome, noble-looking Mr. Cherry"</Q>—universally
esteemed the most completely accomplished fine gentleman
of his time. A picture of Mr. Cherry by Richardson is in
the Picture-gallery at Oxford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry bequeathed to the Bodleian Library a box of very curious old <HI>genuine</HI> manuscripts. The Editor has often heard her mother say, that in the box was a small manuscript book, written entirely by Queen Elizabeth, the cover of pale blue cloth, embroidered with gold and silver leaves and flowers by her <HI>royal fingers,</HI> much better employed, as she NOW FEELS, than when sign∣ing the death-warrant for the <HI>unfortunate Mary</HI>—or the NOBLE <HI>Earl of Essex.</HI> The Editor, in her youth, very seldom went to a new play the first night of acting. She however was persuaded to go to Brooke's "Earl of Essex," where she heard the finest soliloquy put into the mouth of old Burleigh, that even the genius of Brooke could compose, <HI>incomparably</HI> uttered—and the Editor is esteemed by her acquaintance a tolerable judge of speaking; she formerly redde pretty well, having an <HI>absolute</HI> command of her voice in <HI>reading.</HI> It never was spoken but <HI>that once.</HI> When the tragedy was published, it was omitted. The Editor, admiring it very much, made enquiry, but could never meet with any person who remembered it, insomuch that she began to suspect that <HI>she</HI> must have dreamed it. Mention∣ing it a few years ago in a large circle, a gentleman of the company said, <Q REND="inline">"I was at the play that night, and heard that glorious soliloquy."</Q> He then repeated the substance of it to the company, joining with the Editor in supposing that one of Burleigh's descendants had prevailed on Mr. Brooke to throw it out. It must have been the late very amiable Lord Exeter, as the <HI>late</HI> Lord Salisbury would not have cared had Brooke made Burleigh the <HI>actual</HI> butcher of Essex. The Editor honours Dr. Thompson for the employment he has assigned to that cruel wretch Elizabeth, in his very entertaining work "A Voyage to the Moon;" as also for the easy, delightful way in which he dismisses the late Earl of K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, who ceased to be his patron, no one knew why, on some little caprice of the Earl's, as was supposed, as the Editor has heard her Son say.

The Editor and her Sister have a very fine picture
of Mr. Cherry, painted by Riley, in a full-bottomed
twenty-guinea wig, when Mr. Cherry was a Gentleman-Commoner
of Edmund Hall not quite <HI>seventeen</HI> years old.
This tremendous peruke does not so absolutely disguise him,
but that, on <HI>attentive</HI> inspection, he appears a very beauti∣ful
youth.</P>
<P>Mr. Cherry married soon after he was twenty. His
house, which, at the Revolution, made up seventy beds
for the officers and soldiers quartered on him, was the ho∣tel
devoted to friendship, to learning, to distress.</P>
<P>With Sir Constantine Phipps, grandsire of the present
Lord Mulgrave, he formed an acquaintance at Oxford. He
was a native of Reading, and went off from Archbishop
Laud's school to St. John's College, Oxford. It was a very
advantageous connection for the barrister, who, until his ap∣pointment
by Queen Anne to the seals in Ireland, had no
country residence but Shottesbrook House, where himself,
lady, three girls sometimes, the amiable T. Phipps, his
angelic eldest son, their coach-horses, saddle-horses, and

three or four servants, constantly spent four months every
summer.</P>

The Editor cannot forbear mentioning, to the honour of a <HI>sort</HI> of favourite of her's (she believes for his exquisite politeness) Charles the Second, the anecdote that placed Bishop Kenn on the Bench. She does not recollect having ever seen it in print. When the King and Court went down to Winchester, the house of Dr. Kenn was destined to be the residence of Mrs. Gwynne. The good little man declared that <HI>she should not be under his roof.</HI> He was steady as a rock. The intelligence was carried to the King, who said, <Q REND="inline">"Well then, NELL must take a lodging in the city."</Q> All the <HI>Court</HI> Divines, &amp;c. were SHOCKED at Dr. Kenn's <HI>strange</HI> conduct, saying, that <Q REND="inline">"he had <HI>ruined</HI> his fortune, and would never rise in the church"</Q> <HI>(militant).</HI> Some months after, the Bishopric of Bath and Wells becoming vacant, the Minister, &amp;c. recommended (as is always usual, I suppose) some <HI>learned pious</HI> Divines; to which the King answered, <Q REND="inline">"No! none of them shall have it, I assure you. What is the name of that little man at Winchester, that would not let Nell Gwynne lodge at his house?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Dr. Kenn, please your Majesty."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well, he shall have it then. I <HI>resolved</HI> that he should have the first Bishopric that fell, if it had been Canterbury."</Q> The wise and pious Bishop Horne says, in a Ser∣mon before the University, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>And be it known to our adversaries, that</HI> GOD <HI>can, if he see it good</HI> for his faithful servants, advance them in <HI>this</HI> world."</Q> Just after the deprivation of the Bishops, a gentleman, meeting Bishop Kenn, began con∣doling with his Lordship; to which he merrily replied, <Q REND="inline">"God bless you, my friend; do not pity me, man: '<HI>my father lived before me;</HI>' he was an <HI>honest</HI> farmer, and left me twenty pounds a year, thank God."</Q> He spent his time between Long Leate and Shottesbrook House. He <HI>every</HI> morning made a vow that he would not marry <HI>that</HI> day. Mr. Cherry used frequently, on his enter∣ing the breakfast-room, to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my good Lord, is the resolution made this morning?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh yes, Sir, long ago."</Q>—He rose generally very early, and never took a second sleep.</P>
<P>* Mrs. Frinsham always told her daughters, after they ceased to be quite children, <Q REND="inline">"Girls, never assent to a thing because <HI>I</HI> say it; <HI>think</HI> for yourselves; turn it in your own minds, and, if you think differently from me, politely tell me so, and we will examine the matter together."</Q> The Editor well remembers having availed herself of this liberty at eleven years old, when reading the History of England, <HI>à l'egard de</HI> Queen Elizabeth, whom she thus early abhorred, for her horrid deceits, her conduct to Secretary Davison.</P></NOTE> found a second home at Shottesbrook House, dividing his time

&amp;c.</NOTE>, and Mr. <PB N="ccccxxiv" REF="436"/> Cherry's. Dr. Grabe, and
many other learned foreigners, spent much time at Shottesbrook House.</P>
<P>The very learned Charles Leslie was concealed six months
by Mr. Cherry in regimentals, not under his own roof,
but at an house of Mr. Cherry's at White Waltham, then
called the Hill House, now Waltham Place. He went to
Rome at Mr. Cherry's request, and at his expence, to <HI>at∣tempt</HI>
to convert the old Chevalier de St. George. A won∣derful
idea to enter into the heads of two so very sensible
men, to convert an ignorant Papist, forbidden by his
cunning Confessor to search the Scriptures, lest he should
see the ALL-<HI>sufficiency</HI> of Christ to save <HI>lost</HI> sinners. In a letter
from Rome to Mr. Cherry, he says, <Q REND="inline">"It would be much easier
to turn the course of the Thames at London Bridge, than
to convert his Majesty."</Q> This Prince's health was constantly
given every day at Mr. Cherry's, when only Nonjurors were
present. After the death of several of the conscientious non∣juring
Bishops, the few remaining pious nonjuring Prelates,
who were anxious not to continue the schism in the excel∣lent
Church of England, and all the pious Nonjurors agreed,
throughout the kingdom, to go to their respective parish
churches on the same day, always taking care to avoid
praying for the Queen <HI>as Queen.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor has frequently heard her Mother laugh at
the different dispositions of Mr. Cherry and his friend Mr.
<PB N="ccccxxv" REF="437"/>
Dodwell. Every time during the service that the Queen was
prayed for, her Father rose from his knees, (fine gentlemen
kneeled to God in those old-fashioned times—the Editor
hopes they will take to it again, to <HI>distinguish them</HI> from the
<HI>profane</HI> ladies of these times, who almost all now <HI>sit</HI> when
they should <HI>kneel,</HI> although they do not worship—alas!
for them, poor souls!), and stood up facing the congrega∣tion.
Mr. Dodwell used to slide off his knees, and sit
down upon his hassock.</P>
<P>Mr. Cherry, a native of Windsor Forest, was, to the
end of his life, perhaps the keenest stag-hunter in England,
esteemed to ride better than any man in the kingdom, al∣ways
in at the death of the deer. He had one hunter,
a very fine iron grey, an <HI>entire,</HI> who never suffered any one
to mount him but Mr. Cherry. The groom was always
obliged to lead him to water. He once, crossing Maiden∣head
Bridge, got himself and master half over the rails, and
there remained, no one daring to go near; all trembling
for Mr. Cherry, the idol of Berkshire. Boats in abundance
put out, to endeavour to save him, when this spirited
beast should throw him off. In that tremendous situation
he remained near a quarter of an hour, and then got the
beast on the bridge again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of Mr. Cherry's grand-daughters (not the Editor, who had only skill enough to spring off her horse three or four times in a morning's ride) seemed to have inherited the skill of her grandfather, without having learned, as he had, to ride the great horse; for she never has got a fall, not even when learn∣ing to ride; and, whenever she heard of any lady's being thrown, her remark was, <Q REND="inline">"I suppose she <HI>chose</HI> it. I should like to find <HI>any</HI> horse that could get <HI>me</HI> off his back, if I had not an inclination to go."</Q> She accordingly would often lend her own beautiful spirited horse, and ride any wild, or stupid beast for her amusement. If they leap, there she sits; if they go on both knees, there she sits; if they rear up, there she remains! Dr. Berkeley used to tell her, she could sit a stag. She used to say, she seemed to have been born on horse∣back. The late Dr. James once told a gentleman of the Editor's acquaintance, a Prebendary of Canterbury, <Q REND="inline">"If God had meant men should ride so constantly, he would have sent them into the world booted and spurred."</Q> It was more witty than wise. Perhaps it was politic—less of that excellent medicine James's Powder would be sold, if persons rode more on horseback. A tenant's wife of old Mr. Cherry, having purchased an old hunter, used regularly to ride to Windsor Market, when farmers LADIES were not <HI>quite</HI> so <HI>fine</HI> as in these days, with two large paniers of butter and eggs. One hunting morning, hearing the hounds, the poor old beast pricked up his ears, and set off. Every effort of the old woman to hold him in was in vain.—Away he flew, and soon reduced the butter and eggs to a <HI>fine liquid.</HI> It dashed Yeomen, Prickers, Lords, Com∣moners, and <HI>even</HI> his Majesty, to the great diversion of the witty Charles, who would not suffer any one to attempt stopping the horse. At the death of the deer, his Majesty ordered the butter and eggs to be <HI>amply</HI> paid for, and told the honest old woman, who began begging pardon, &amp;c. that he should be glad of her company often upon the field, adding, <Q REND="inline">"I have not been so entertained for a long time."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccxxvi" REF="438"/>
Archbishop Potter told the late Archdeacon Dodwell the
following anecdote of his father's excellent friend.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"King William, who valued himself much on his horse∣manship,
was frequently mortified by hearing his courtiers
admiring Mr. Cherry's wonderful skill in riding, and re∣solved
at length that he would follow Mr. Cherry every
<PB N="ccccxxvii" REF="439"/>
where. After some days, Mr. Cherry, finding that it was
not chance that constantly kept his Majesty just behind
him, determined to try to serve his, as he conceived, <HI>lawful</HI>
Sovereign, by breaking the neck of the <HI>Usurper.</HI> He
went over many very dangerous places. The King, excel∣lently
mounted, and a very good horseman, still followed.
One day, when the stag took the soil, Mr Cherry instantly
plunged into a frightfully deep and broad part of the
Thames. The King went to the brink, looked, and looked
again, then shook his head, and retired. His Majesty
thought the actual possession of <HI>three</HI> kingdoms better than
the <HI>fame</HI> of being as good a horseman as Mr. Cherry,
thus yielding the palm to Mr. Cherry. He never
followed him afterwards, to the great comfort of his
Majesty's attendants."</Q> The late Sir Robert Gayer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor and her sister have a most beautiful miniature, the property of Mr. Cherry, done in Italy, of this wonderfully beautiful extraordinary man, with whom their grandfather was exceedingly intimate. When he lost his lovely lady, for whom he mourned seven years, he never changed his linen, walked about the park unshaved, in an old black long loose freeze coat, almost a Nebucadnezzar. The Editor has heard her Mother, and her old intimate friend Mrs. Baldwyn, his grand-daughter, and mother of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Annesley, Esquire, of Blechingdon, say, that the poor women of Stoke would threaten their bawling brats with, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>If you keep crying, I'll give you to Sir Robert.</HI>"</Q> At the expiration of somewhat more than seven years, he dressed like a rational being, went and made a visit to Mr. Cherry at Shottesbrook House, and, on entering, saluted Mrs. Cherry. Now, alas! comes the throughly tragical part of this tale; which the Editor, when young, used to tell some gentlemen, of her friends, she would print, and, to humble the <HI>lords</HI> of the creation, have bound up with "The History of the EPHESIAN MATRON."—"LORD, <HI>what is</HI> MAN?" After some time, poor <HI>wretched</HI> Sir Robert married a beautiful widow, his own near relation, Lady Christian Rolle, by whom he had several children. His first, so singularly lamented lady, left four fine sons, all of whom he bred up gentlemen, to no profession. At his death, his very large estate fell, unavoidably, to his eldest son, who married the very uncommonly sensible lady Elizabeth Annesly. On opening his will, it appeared that this, what must one style him?—<HI>Monster of Cruelty</HI> is a milk-and-water title for him—had bequeathed to his three younger sons of the THUS lamented lady only FIVE HUNDRED pounds each—Good God!!! and to (the Editor thinks) <HI>six</HI> children of Lady Christian Rolle, each SIX THOUSAND POUNDS. Attend to the fate of the three mal-treated young gentlemen. One died, within a few months, of a broken heart. Another was deprived of his reason, and never perfectly recovered it, although he lived to possess, one can hardly say enjoy, his <HI>horrid</HI> father's great estate at Hurley, Berks, (now the property of the excellent Duke of Marlborough), after the death of his nephew, the late Robert Gayer, Esquire, of Hurley. The third of these injured sons patiently, resignedly, sunk his five hundred pounds in an an∣nuity, and went to board with a farmer at Stoke—the, at that time well-known, witty Joe Hewett, who was in all the gay parties of the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. He had been many years valet de chambre to <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; and had not the beautiful Lady Catharine <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> been pulled back when getting out at one of the windows of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, his grandson had been a Peer of <HI>England.</HI> This made a <HI>little</HI> noise at the time. The only son of Sir William <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was going to marry the beautiful Nan Fisher, the chamber-maid of the Sun Inn at Maidenhead, Berks, but Nan would insist upon going to town to buy <HI>wedding</HI> cloaths; <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>alas! they were converted into <HI>mourning</HI> weeds, for the Earl and Sir William met, made up a match between Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and Lady Catharine <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, and they were a very <HI>decently</HI> happy couple; as the Editor has frequently heard her Mother, and many other friends of that day, relate her Ladyship's conduct as a <HI>wife,</HI> and a <HI>mother,</HI> was excellent. A writer of romance would certainly marry the agreeable Joe to Nan Fisher. He married a very rich farmer's widow, by whom he had a very worthy agreeable daughter, whom, it was supposed, that the resigned Mr. Gayer would have married. That happy-tempered, injured gentleman, the Editor remembers; he did not die until after she was grown up a woman. Good-tempered persons generally live longer than bad ones; and it is certain that their lives are much pleasanter.</NOTE>, of

During the reign of King William, Mr. Cherry always
on hunting days rode up to the Princess of Denmark's ca∣lash,
(the chaise in which her Royal Highness hunted was
so called,) to pay his respects. The Princess admired his
conversation, his uncommonly fine understanding, and ex∣quisitely
high breeding, as politeness (now said to be HOR∣RIDLY
old fashioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Lady, who does the Editor the honour to rank her amongst her eldest friends, having had the <HI>real</HI> pleasure to have been well acquainted with her since she was seven years old, the wonderfully well informed, all-accom∣plished Countess of Orkney—who has more than once said to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"There are two things, however old-fashioned, in which I am resolved to persist. I will not give up the little politeness I possess, nor ever dress like my housemaid."</Q> The Editor has always had the honour to resemble her Ladyship in that idea before Lady Orkney was born; when going into a dra∣per's shop in York Street, to purchase a morning gown, constantly saying, <Q REND="inline">"Be pleased, Sir, to shew me some linens that <HI>my maid would not wear.</HI>"</Q> Several years ago, at a very large rout at the worthy Lady Head's, a gentleman came up to the card-table where the Editor was playing, and accosted her thus: <Q REND="inline">"Well, Mrs. Berkeley, have <HI>you</HI> heard how the King has FLUMMERED your young neighbour, Lady Mary O'Brien?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Not I."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! then <HI>I'll</HI> tell you.

Did you ever hear such <HI>flummer</HI> in your whole life?"</Q> Every one said, <Q REND="inline">"That was a very high-flown compliment to her indeed."</Q> The Edi∣tor said, rather briskly, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>By no means.</HI> I, who have the honour to know the young Lady well, throw down my gauntlet, to prove that it is <HI>no flattery at all.</HI> Her father is, I do in my conscience really believe, the most com∣pletely well-bred man in Europe.

himself her subject, <HI>whilst</HI> her father and brother
<PB N="ccccxxxi" REF="443"/>
were living; Mr. Cherry took great pains, as far as the
oath of a woman of the bed-chamber to King James's
Queen <HI>could</HI> ascertain it, to be fully convinced that the
Chevalier de St. George was <HI>actually produced</HI> by his Queen.
The oath of the facts to which the lady swore was care∣fully
preserved by Mr. Cherry; and accordingly, the first
day that her Majesty hunted after her accession to the
throne, Mr. Cherry kept <HI>aloof</HI> from <HI>Royalty.</HI> Her Majesty
called to her officer, known in those days by the name of
the <HI>Bottle-man,</HI> saying,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Peachy, if my eyes do not deceive me, I see Mr.
Cherry upon the field."</Q></P>
<P>Peachy.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, please your Majesty, he is yonder."</Q>
(pointing with his whip.)</P>
<P>The Queen.—<Q REND="inline">"Aye, he will not come to <HI>me now.</HI>
I know the reason. But go you, and carry him a couple
of bottles of red wine and white <HI>from me;</HI> and tell him,

<P>The Editor, although not so <HI>nobly</HI> descended as her be∣loved

knowing she is descended from <HI>honest</HI> ancestors; and the
character always given by the sensible, elegant, lovely Mrs.

was, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>They are honest to the bone</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Editor was a girl about eleven years old, dining one day with a very intimate friend of her Mother, together with three or four more of Mrs. Sheeles's young ladies, the good lady recommended to their kind care Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, daughter of Colonel <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who was going the next week to Mrs. Sheeles's school.

Mrs. Sheeles, with her wonted <HI>excellent</HI> skill, <HI>furbished</HI> her up.

<P>When Mr. Monck Berkeley sometimes saw persons <HI>acting
polite deceits,</HI> he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, whatever faults I have,
thank God and my Mother, <HI>I am at least an honest man.</HI>"</Q>
A very witty friend of the Editor's youth, well known
in the world for his <HI>bons mols,</HI> now no more, used to say,
when men of <HI>a certain rank</HI> in the world acted like scoun∣drels,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, <HI>he</HI> will <HI>not</HI> be hanged; for no poor wretch
ever goes to the gallows, whose confession does not begin,
That he was born of <HI>poor,</HI> but HONEST parents."</Q></P>
<P>But to return to Mr. Cherry. He did not return his
<HI>duty</HI> to a Sovereign <HI>he</HI> did not acknowledge as such; he
<PB N="ccccxxxiii" REF="445"/>
requested Mr. Peachy to present his very humble respects
and best thanks to his (Mr. Peachy's) Mistress, for the high
honour conferred on him. The favour was frequently re∣peated.</P>
<P>Mr. Cherry died just one year before the Queen. After
the Rebellion in 1715, Mrs. Cherry in her coach, with her
two daughters, driving down Ludgate Hill, met several
coaches filled with the unfortunate gentlemen who had been
in the Rebellion returning to Newgate after their sentence:
she exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear girls, bless the goodness of
God, that your excellent father is <HI>dead,</HI> or he had been
amongst those unhappy men; for, I am sure, he would
never have worn a sword without drawing it in <HI>this</HI>
cause; and he would certainly have been hanged."</Q></P>
<P>King William sent repeated offers of any thing, and
every thing, to Mr. Cherry, if he would go to Court, and
take the oaths. Queen Anne, it should seem, was too well
acquainted with Mr. Cherry to make him <HI>any such</HI> offers,
She shewed her esteem for that <HI>throughly honest</HI> man in other
ways.</P>
<P>A considerable part of Mr. Cherry's very large estate lay
in Windsor Forest. It is to this day a lucky circumstance
for the beautiful county of Berks, that Mr. Cherry's won∣derfully

acute father, when in the country, resided there
rather than at his estate in Surrey.</P>
<P>On the first laying on the land-tax, meetings were called
by the Sheriffs in every county in England. At Reading,
nearly central, always the county town, until the old Lord
Harcourt contrived to get electors and jurymen dragged
down to Abingdon, the last town—parish—in the county—At
Reading the whole county met, and were harangued by
a <HI>ministerial</HI> orator, telling them <Q REND="inline">"that the tax was only to
be levied ONE <HI>year,</HI> and every gentleman and yeoman was
to give in the full value of his own estate."</Q> Some <HI>few</HI> of
the gentlemen, zealous friends to the new government,
(for Berks was always an honest Tory county) and others
from motives of vanity, gave in the value of their
estates more than double, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Come, let us do the
thing <HI>handsomely, generously.</HI>"</Q> When an entry was about
to be committed to paper, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor often contemplates with admiration the very wonderfully sensible, thoughtful, sedate countenance of her great grandfather, in a very fine portrait of that great lawyer, painted by Richardson, at an advanced age.

<P>The great-grandsire of the present Lord le Despenser
cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Cherry speaks like an <HI>Oracle.</HI> I am sure,
in my <HI>hurry,</HI> I have given in <HI>my</HI> estate <HI>too</HI> high."</Q> It lay

his Son (four in the morning) he drew it out again, saying,

they have not more. A famous old ferryman at Bray Island used to say,

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearest Creature,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have several times begun to
give you some directions for your behaviour after my
death, but always found you so impatient of any such
<PB N="ccccxli" REF="453"/>
discourse, that, I have reason to believe, you remember
very little of what I have said to you upon that subject,
and therefore think it necessary to leave in writing the
few directions following: with which (how unreasonable
soever they may seem to you) I assure myself of your
ready compliance, from the long experience I have had
of the greatest duty and affection that ever woman shewed
to an husband, and for which I return you these my last
and most hearty thanks. First, as to my funeral, which
will be the first trouble; I desire to be buried, if it may
be, the morrow night after I shall die, and so private, that
I would have no person know it, or be invited to it, ex∣cept
four of the poorest of your tenants to carry me to
my grave; to each of which I desire you to give five
shillings in money. I would have no atchievement,
<PB N="ccccxlii" REF="454"/>
escutcheon, or pall. I desire to be buried in the church∣yard
of Shottesbrook House, between the vault where
my father lyeth, and the chancel belonging to Shot∣tesbrook
House. I would have a brick-work of two
or three foot raised over my grave, and a plain black
marble laid upon it, without any arms, name, or other
inscription but this which followeth,<Q><L>HIC · IACET · PECCATORUM · MAXIMUS.</L>
<L>ANNO · DOM. M.DCC . . . . .</L></Q> supplying the date of the year of my death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry died in September 1713. His directions to his excellent lady, were, in general, complied with. The burial-ground was, after his interment, railed-in, with iron railing, and planted with cypress, and other funeral shrubs; which the present Lord of the Manor, and the late Rector, conceiving to be in∣jurious to the church, they removed them, to the great regret of his descendant the late George Monck Berkeley, Esq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Second. I desire you to take warning by me, and
not to engage yourself or children in any of my trouble∣some
concerns, which have broke my heart, and will
never suffer either you or them to enjoy any happiness
or quiet if you meddle with them. I therefore beg of
you (as the last and greatest instance of love that I can
shew you) to content yourself with what was settled upon
my marriage, and the addition settled since by my father
<PB N="ccccxliii" REF="455"/>
in pursuance of our marriage settlement articles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry marrying before he was of age, could only enter into articles to sign, fulfil, &amp;c. when of age. Part of Mrs. Cherry's fortune was in land, which could not be properly shared until her four younger sisters became of age.</NOTE>. There
you have a RIGHT to both, in LAW and CONSCIENCE,
antecedent to any debts either of myself or my father, and
therefore may, with a good conscience, claim and enjoy
them. But, as to the rest of my estate, both real and
personal, I desire you to let it go to the payment of debts.
This will draw down a blessing upon what you have left,
and vindicate, in some measure, the honesty <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry's <HI>honesty</HI> wanted no vindication. A short time before the death of his father he happened to see in his father's study a book, containing a list of his debts. He purchased one estate with debts upon it, which he knew, had life been lent him, he had soon wiped off. On the servant's announcing in the night to Mr. Cherry, that his father was released, three days after the glass of the chariot was taken out of his head, he said to his lady, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I am</HI> now thirty thousand pounds in debt; for I am resolved to pay every shilling that my father owed."</Q> So far was quite right, surely; but, alas! he immediately took up his father's bonds, and gave his own. Mr. Cherry's fine judgement certainly failed him here. Almost every one pressed on him to be paid imme∣diately, knowing, that, should he have a son born (he had buried two), the estate was so entailed, that it could not possibly be sold. As it was, with only daughters, they were obliged, after the death of their excellent father, to get an Act of Parliament to sell it. At a meeting of creditors one day at a Judge's cham∣bers, the Editor has often heard her mother say, that Mr. Spinckes, author of "The Sick Man visited," one of the creditors, came up to Mrs. Cherry, and said, <Q REND="inline">"It may, perhaps, Madam, be an odd thing for a clergyman to say; but I must say, that Mr. Cherry was a too honest man. Why not let us wait, and re∣ceive out interest punctually, as we always had done from old Mr. Cherry?"</Q> The celebrated Mrs. Barbara Porter arrested Mr. Cherry for her debt of <HI>only two hundred pounds;</HI> for which his grand-daughter, the Editor, always hangs her beautiful small picture in the store-room; his other grand-daughter often threatens to hang it in a more ignoble place, the temple of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. To be sure, she had a fine face and a clever brain; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>but the beast had no heart.</HI>"</Q> She was Mr. Cherry's god-mother. He certainly did not learn his <HI>exquisite</HI> kindness to the distressed from <HI>this lady.</HI> The respectful sheriff's officers conjured him to go to Reading gaol in his chariot; but he would not, took his cane, and walked with them. He remained there but a few days; but the Editor has frequently heard her mother say it cost him above an hundred pounds, for all the noblemen and gentlemen of the county went to visit him. Mr. Cherry experienced the truth of one text of Scripture on this event. A nephew of his lady, who was under very great pecuniary obligations, as well as a thousand amiable attentions in his youth, begged to be excused being bound for Mr. Cherry, saying, <Q REND="inline">"that he had promised his wife, when he married, "that he would never be bound for any one." What a convenient <HI>thing</HI> a wise sometimes is to <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>!"</Q> The very worthy Vicar of the poor pitiful <HI>living,</HI> or rather <HI>starving,</HI> of White Waltham, in the gift of Mr. Cherry, set out immediately to a gentlemen who had married a near relation of Mr. Cherry, desiring him to be joint bondsman with him for Mr. Cherry. The gentleman, not a very brilliant genius, hesitating a little, Mr. Griffith said, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, Mr. Cherry would be torn to pieces by wild horses sooner than fly from his bail."</Q> The Clergy are certainly, in general, some few exceptions of <HI>Digni∣taries</HI> of the church of **********, a very liberal body of men. The Editor takes this opportunity of making her public acknowledgements to the polite amiable Mr. Hambley of Herts, the present vicar of Cookham, for his very pleasing conduct to Dr. Berkeley, when Dr. Berkeley quitted that lovely spot, and to the Editor since. Dr. Berkeley always left all unpleasant business to the Editor, as he always made her open letters that he suspected to be unpleasant. He charged her to write him word how <HI>she</HI> liked his successor. She wrote him word, that in Mr. Hambley's <HI>bearing armorial</HI> was a <HI>lion,</HI> but that <HI>she</HI> thought he ought to apply to their friend Sir Isaac [Heard] to exchange that ferocious animal for a <HI>dove</HI> or a <HI>lamb.</HI> As also to the exquisitely polite Mr. Barker, who succeeded Dr. Berkeley as Chancellor of Brecon. But <HI>he</HI> has only <HI>ten children;</HI> and he has the excellent Bishop Stuart, of St. David, for a patron, at which the Editor most sincerely rejoices. Those that are judges know that Mr. Barker is a gentleman of profound erudition, and that the good Bishop has honoured himself by preferring Mr. Barker, a stranger to his Lordship, as his very polite son, of Christ's College, told the Editor, until he became his Diocesan.</NOTE> of</P>

sister) James Hayes, Esq. of Holyport, father of James Hayes,
Esq. late one of his Majesty's Judges for North Wales, then
recently married.) Mr. Cherry said one day to his lady,
<Q REND="inline">"We have not had the new-married couple to dinner: yet
we must have them; the last venison we shall have this
season is fit to dress for every body but myself;" (Mr.
Cherry frequently had a haunch hung up, like his nephew
Dr. Cherry Hayes, of Windsor, until it was ready to shake
from the bone). "Send over a servant to invite them for
Saturday."</Q> Of course some other families in the neighbour∣hood
<PB N="ccccxlvi" REF="458"/>
were invited to meet them. During the time of
dinner Mr. Cherry said, <Q REND="inline">"It is just come into my head,
that I must have a dance with the bride."</Q>—Mrs. Cherry
objected, lest it might injure him. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear,
I am as well able to dance now as I was the first time I
had the happiness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There had been a quarrel between the gamekeepers of Mr. Finch and Mr. Cherry. Their manors joining, so there was no visiting. Mr. Cherry, however, met the lady at a neighbour's, and, as in antient times, danced the whole night with her. At breakfast one was saying, how soundly they had slept, and another that they had slept little. Mr. Francis Cherry said, <Q REND="inline">"I can't tell how it was, but I could not sleep at all."</Q> An acute lady said to his anxious mother, (Mr. Cherry, a sort of <HI>Isaac,</HI> born after his sisters were almost women,) <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I</HI> can tell you why <HI>Frank</HI> did not sleep, it was because the FINCHES kept such a twittering at his windows, it was <HI>impossible</HI> he <HI>should</HI> sleep."</Q> Mr. Cherry told his single, his favourite sister, who fell into a con∣sumption, and died for the loss of an accomplished young gentleman, to whom she was going to be married, that <HI>if ever</HI> he married, he then hardly twenty, <HI>she</HI> had seen the lady. She replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear brother, that is <HI>impossible;</HI> you know there has been a quarrel between the families."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well, then, <HI>I</HI> will make PEACE."</Q> He did so, for never did family live in greater harmony than old Mr. Cherry, his excellent lady, and Mr. and Mrs. F. Cherry. They had no other home, either in town or country, but Shottersbrook House and Arundel Street—the house now made into three. Old Mr. Cherry allowed his son £.2,500 <HI>per annum</HI> to fly about to Astrop, Bath, &amp;c. and to relieve dis∣tressed objects—a favourite amusement of Mr. F. Cherry, as well as of his great grandson George Monck Berkeley, Esquire.</NOTE> to dance with you."</Q> The young lady,
one of the most amiable of women—(the Hayes family are
remarkably lucky in choosing sweet-tempered women, at least
Mr. Hayes and his son were so; may their worthy descendants

be as fortunate as their father and grandfather!—when these
gentlemen lost their <HI>lovely</HI> mother, the Editor lost a <HI>most
sincerely</HI> beloved friend; and ALL the surrounding poor a real
<HI>visible</HI> Guardian Angel. Adieu, sweet spirit!)—this lady
may, perhaps, like to think that she has danced with her
old uncle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cherry was esteemed one of the finest dancers, as well as the first horseman, in England; and HE certainly did not esteem dancing a sin: he was not one of the gloomy Christians, disgracing instead of <Q REND="inline">"adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour."</Q> He was a great studier of the Holy Scriptures; and had, no doubt, often redde, as well as his grand-daughter, Mrs. George Berkeley, although, perhaps, he had not occasion in those days to quote it so frequently, the promise of God by the prophet Jeremiah, <Q REND="inline">"Thou shalt again go forth in the dances of them that <HI>make merry.</HI>"</Q> The late John Wesley says, in his ridiculous account, printed by himself, of his seminary for educating young hypocrites, <Q REND="inline">"the children at certain times are allowed to RECREATE themselves" (there was surely need that they should be <HI>re</HI>-created after being under his tuition); "for the word <HI>play</HI> is never used, never <HI>heard</HI> of, amongst them."</Q> Now, God, speaking by his Holy Prophet Zechariah, says, <Q REND="inline">"there shall yet again be boys and girls PLAYING in the streets of Jerusalem."</Q> (ch. viii. ver. 5.) It is lament∣able to remark, that those who affect so much more strictness, rigidity, or what you please, than is enjoined by God himself, generally fall into the shameful breach of part of the second table. This <Q REND="inline">"loading men and poor little children with these heavy burdens and grievous to be borne,"</Q> is often a <HI>blind,</HI> to conceal the breach, the open breach, of the seventh or eighth command∣ments. Mr. Cherry was certainly not one of <HI>this sort</HI> of Christians; for, until the end of his life, he, his lady, and daughters (the youngest near sixteen at the time of her father's death), always danced several nights, every full moon, at his own, and several neighbouring gentlemen's seats; fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters, all danced together. Young ladies were at <HI>least as</HI> virtuous, in those <HI>old-fashioned</HI> days, as they are at present. The House of Peers was not <HI>quite</HI> so often applied to for dissolving marriages as they are at present. Alas! let us remember that God, speaking of the Jewish nation, says, <Q REND="inline">"they assem∣bled by troops in (the witty, wise, pious Dr. Young, in his 'Centaur not fabulous,' says) the LADIES houses.

Let us of this still-spared nation beware lest we fall into like condemnation. It is in the power often of the most unimportant person to brow-beat this dreadful grow∣ing sin; and woe to those who can, by their high rank and station in life, do it, if they do it not to the <HI>utmost</HI> of their power!</NOTE> (Mr. Cherry died at 46). Then, turning to the

butler, he ordered him to send the groom over to Woo∣burn,
to fetch the music: it soon arrived, and to dancing
they went, and continued their dance until the clock
struck twelve. Mr. Cherry went to church on the Sunday,

About four in the afternoon, the day preceding his death, he sud∣denly put back the curtain, raised his head, and uttered the following sentence: <Q REND="inline">"There is a very great fire in London this night"</Q>—then closed his eyes, and lay some few hours as before.

<P>It is impossible to dismiss the short account of that <HI>real</HI>
Patriot, Bishop Berkeley, without mentioning his voyage
to America; one grand design of which, no doubt, was,
to introduce Episcopacy, <HI>unadulerated</HI> Episcopacy, that of the
incomparable Church of England into the Western Hemis∣phere;
his Lordship frequently declaring, <Q REND="inline">"If Sir <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and

lost; they will shake off the Mother Country in a few
years. Nothing but introducing Bishops amongst them
<HI>can</HI> keep them together, can keep them loyal<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As does plainly appear at this time in France. The late Dr. Berkeley, many years ago, once said in a Sermon, <Q REND="inline">"I am persuaded that the <HI>sole</HI> cause why <HI>so</HI> idolatrous a church as that of Rome has been spared thus long is, because they have <HI>so strenuously</HI> maintained the co-equal Godhead of the Saviour of the World."</Q> And, about two years since, that very learned Divine and excellent Preacher the Rev. Dr. Neve, Prebendary of Worcester, said, when preaching, <Q REND="inline">"The reason, I am convinced, why God has delivered up to such distress, devastation, and destruction, the great kingdoms of France, Poland, and Hungary, is, <HI>because they</HI> have given up the GODHEAD of the LORD JESUS CHRIST;"</Q> which, in France, every one knows, was owing to that MONSTER of <HI>villany</HI> (for he certainly was <HI>not</HI> an infidel, but a rascal) VOLTAIRE.

<HI>not</HI> oppose it, as it has <HI>long</HI> been to <HI>those that did,</HI> that Dr.
Berkeley, Prebendary of Canterbury, by his wise argu∣ments,
persuaded the learned, sensible, pious Prelates of
Scotland to consecrate Bishop Seabury, to <HI>their</HI> honour,
and the <HI>delight</HI> of his own amiable spirit; and, it may be
hoped, to the everlasting happiness of many thousands of
souls; for, when the opposers saw that <HI>one</HI> Protestant Bishop
had been furnished to America, notwithstanding all their
opposition, they <HI>e'en</HI> sent a few more. Why such opposi∣tion
has been made to the conferring of that invaluable bles∣sing

on the Western World for almost three quarters of a

the arrival of that great day—<Q>"<HI>That day for which ALL other days were made.</HI>" <BIBL>Dr. YOUNG.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Editor has frequently heard Dr. Berkeley, and his
mother, who was there, say, that in Rhode Island, about
twenty miles in circumference, there were, at the time of
the Bishop's residence there, <HI>no less</HI> than <HI>sixteen</HI> different
sects in religion, Presbyterians, Baptists of various sorts, &amp;c.;
and it was customary for strangers to ask their visitors, <Q REND="inline">"Pray
of what religion are you?"</Q> and discourse with them on the
subject of their dissent from the other FIFTEEN. All, how∣ever,
excelled the majority, alas! in England at present, in
<HI>agreeing,</HI> that it was <HI>necessary</HI> to keep <HI>one</HI> day in seven
holy to the Supreme Governor of the universe. Accordingly,
on the Bishop's making this usual enquiry, it was sometimes
answered, <Q REND="inline">"I am a Friday-man—I a Saturday-man,"</Q> and
others acknowledged themselves SEEKERS—that they were
<HI>seeking</HI> for the <HI>best</HI> religion, and had not <HI>yet</HI> found it.
These, it is to be feared, excel thousands in England, who
<HI>never</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our Blessed Saviour, in the Holy Gospel, tells us, <Q REND="inline">"Many shall SEEK to enter in, and shall not be able;"</Q> that we must <Q REND="inline">"STRIVE, &amp;c."</Q> The witty Dr. Young, speaking of <HI>mighty good sort of gentle, polite</HI> (Christians one supposes) says—<Q><L>"Who make an <HI>unobtrusive</HI> tender of</L>

their religion, which they often did twice in six weeks,
if they did not turn to the husband's or wife's, and
would exchange it for a <HI>new</HI> one, <HI>that new</HI> one should be
the Church of England; so tacitly acknowledging that to
be best of FIFTEEN different religions. Surely ladies who
are fond of new fashions would find it <HI>mighty pleasant</HI> to
reside <HI>sometimes</HI> at Rhode Island—a quite <HI>new watering∣place.</HI></P>
<P>This account has been confirmed to the Editor by the
very worthy, amiable Samuel Johnson, Esquire, of Connecti∣cut,
before mentioned in this Preface, who was a Privy∣counsellor
of Connecticut, the only Church of England-man
that colony had ever elected. He was sent over here, before
we lost America, to solicit a cause before his Majesty's
Privy Council. He was many years here—about seven. His
father, Dr. Samuel Johnson, a very learned man, an emi∣nent
Presbyterian minister, was convinced by Bishop Berke∣ley's
arguments, and saw the <HI>Divine</HI> right of Episcopacy.
He preached several Sundays upon it, and at length told
his congregation, that he was so fully convinced of it, that
<PB N="ccccliii" REF="465"/>
the next Sunday he should attend Episcopal worship, and
wished <HI>them all</HI> to accompany him, (which most of them
did,) telling them, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>he</HI> should not PRESUME to minister
any longer in things sacred, until he had obtained Episco∣pal
ordination;"</Q> which he soon did. He wrote several very
learned treatises, and a very good Hebrew Grammar. His
excellent son had the degree of LL.D. conferred on him
by the University of Oxford during his residence in Eng∣land.
He always spent great part of every summer at Dr.
Berkeley's, and constantly, until after the breaking out of
the American war, sent over two immense double barrels
of fine American New-Town pippins, the finest grow∣ing
on Long Island, of which his elder brother was
proprietor.</P>
<P>The Editor used to delight all her friends and neighbours
by presenting them with some, and herself by making her
gardener every year sow some pips in the melon-frame, and
at proper times plant them out. There are now eight fine
trees, thicker than herself, bearing six different fruits, only
one of them resembling the parent fruit; one quite through
the colour of an orange, exquisitely finely flavoured for
about six weeks, when it becomes so nauseously sweet,
that nothing but her Chinese pigs will eat them; one a
green, strong, sour apple, that keeps till May. The Edi∣tor
is a great gardener, and made her children such, telling
her friends, that "when God created man, HE placed him
<PB N="ccccliv" REF="466"/>
in a <HI>garden,</HI> not in a <HI>house.</HI> It was SIN that made an <HI>house</HI>
necessary as well as <HI>cloaths.</HI> The young women now con∣trive
to do without cloathing. The Editor wishes some
contrivance could be found out for aged matrons to do
without houses, as rent and TAXES run away with much of
a small income.</P>
<P>In one thing, however, the different sectarists, both men
and women, all agreed, viz. in a <HI>rage</HI> for finery, to the
great amusement of Bishop Berkeley's two learned, ele∣gant
friends, Sir John James, and Richard Dalton, Esquire;
the men in flaming scarlet coats and waistcoats, laced and
fringed with the brightest <HI>glaring yellow.</HI> The <HI>sly</HI> Quakers,
not <HI>venturing</HI> on these <HI>charming</HI> coats and waistcoats, yet
loving finery, figured away with plate at their side-board,
or rather <HI>beaufait.</HI> One, to the no small diversion of Bi∣shop
Berkeley, sent to England, and had made on purpose,
no such thing being to be found, a noble large tea-pot of
solid gold, and enquired of the Bishop, when drinking tea
with him, whether <HI>friend</HI> Berkeley had ever seen such a
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>curious</HI> thing?"</Q> On being told that silver ones were
much in use in England, but that he had never seen a gold
one; Ebenezer replied, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, that was the thing; I was
resolved to have something <HI>finer</HI> than any body else. They
say that the Queen (Queen Caroline) has not got one."</Q>
The Bishop delighted his ridiculous host, by assuring him,
<Q REND="inline">"that his was an unique;"</Q> and very happy it made him.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclv" REF="467"/>
Oh, the fools! say rather the knaves! If the Kingdom
of God, as speaks St. Paul, <Q REND="inline">"does not consist in meat and
drink;"</Q> can it signify whether an insignificant individual
wears a coat or gown of one colour or another?</P>
<P>The Editor once met a rich Quaker woman at tea, at
the house of a person of quality in her neighbourhood, and
happened to have on a pair of very fine point ruffles, pur∣chased
at the time of her marriage, for she loved her chil∣dren
too well to buy fine point or lace afterwards. After
tea, the company, as is surely pleasant in summer, went
out to stroll in the garden; when the lady of the house called
the attention of the Quaker to the Editor's lace. She
<HI>piously</HI> shook her <HI>wise</HI> head, and said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I doubt thee beest
proud of them, vain of them.</HI>"</Q> The Editor quietly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"I hope not: why should I? I am a gentleman's daughter,
and a gentleman's wife; and I have, from my cradle, been
dressed as such; and if <HI>thee</HI>"—(the Editor always <HI>thees</HI> and
<HI>thous</HI> them—they like <HI>Sir</HI> or <HI>Madam</HI> much better; but, if
they will <HI>not give it,</HI> they ought in CONSCIENCE <HI>not to receive
it</HI>)—"and, if <HI>thee</HI> wilt excuse me, I do not think that I
have half the vanity that <HI>thou</HI> hast; for <HI>I</HI> have not once
called the attention of any of the company to my ruffles,
and thou hast gone to every individual in the room, to
shew them that bauble at thy watch, telling them, it
was given to thee by Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, and taking that op∣portunity
of shewing a very fine watch; besides, as that
<PB N="cccclvi" REF="468"/>
is a solid pebble, not an egg that opens, to hold some∣thing
to regale thy nose, I fear it must be deemed a VAIN
ornament. Now ruffles keep my arms warm."</Q> A circle
gathered round the Lady who exhibited the ruffles, Friend
 <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and Mrs. Berkeley. They all laughed much; and
the poor Quaker said, <Q REND="inline">"Thee beest right; it is of no
use; I will take it off when I go home, and lock it
up."</Q></P>
<P>When Dr. Berkeley was rector of Action, a female Qua∣ker,
who lived in the next parish, and was said to rouge
her cheeks, hearing the same of Dr. Berkeley's preaching,
desired to go to Acton church with Mr. and Mrs. W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>.
A day or two after, Mr. W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s family dining at

a little out of luck last Sunday;"</Q> then related as
above; adding, <Q REND="inline">"that ever <HI>she</HI> should come to hear <HI>her
people</HI> so <HI>tuned!</HI>"</Q> The sentence alluded to was, <Q REND="inline">"All
Christians, of every communion, agree in this point, ex∣cepting
the Quakers, if indeed <HI>they</HI> can be <HI>styled Chris∣tians,</HI>
who have no sacraments at all, and who do not al∣low
of Water Baptism, despising that important denunci∣ation
of our adored Redeemer, 'Except a man be born
of WATER and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of Heaven."</Q> The Friend, however, told Mrs.
W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, that Dr. Berkeley was a very fine Preacher.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclvii" REF="469"/>
Bishop Berkeley was a <HI>real</HI> Patriot, not a PAT-RIOT, as

Berkeley went to reside at Cloyne, in the year 1734, he
found the <HI>unfortunate</HI> Mr. Fitzgerald as above described,
and in his grand climacteric. He habited him comfortably,
gave him an invitation to dine at the palace every day,
bought him a quiet horse, on which he rode out in fine
weather, the Bishop keeping it, and one of his grooms attend∣ing
to it. When any person dined at the palace beside the
Bishop's family, Mr. Fitzgerald, at his own entreaty,
always dined at the steward's table; to whose room
he every day retired to smoke his pipe. Dr. Berkeley and
his brother, when there was not company, frequently at∣tending

Ireland for their kindness to their <HI>fallen</HI> superiors. As Mrs.
Fitzgerald kept no maid, the neighbouring poor women

they, amongst them, did it for them. Bishop Berkeley,
on his leaving Ireland to go to reside at Oxford, to super∣intend
his Son's education there, left a certain establish∣ment
at Cloyne. Mr. Fitzgerald dined there every day as
usual, his horse being kept, &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="cccclx" REF="472"/>
estate, ever gave him a shilling. It was not pleasant to them
to hear him named.</P>
<P>One day, when they, their ladies, and families, had
dined at Bishop Berkeley's, just as the coaches were driving
out of the court-yard, a violent clamour, was heard <HI>scolding,
screaming, crying.</HI> It was, alas! poor Mrs. Fitzgerald
and her daughters, reproaching their noble, rich, (not,
alas! very <Q REND="inline">"<HI>rich in good works,</HI></Q> &amp;c.) kindred with <Q REND="inline">"avarice
and cruelty, enjoying <HI>their</HI> estate, and leaving them to
starve, but for the good Bishop."</Q></P>
<P>The very grateful Mr. Fitzgerald had made a will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has frequently been told, by Bishop Berkeley's learned, agree∣able friend Richard Dalton, Esquire, that his friend Sir John James, Baronet, told Bishop Benson, that he had bequeathed his very large estate, excepting a few legacies to his dear friend Bishop Berkeley. Bishop Benson wrote what he, lovely man, thought the <HI>pleasant</HI> news to Cloyne; and received in return a <HI>thundering</HI> letter, as Mr. Dalton termed it, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Do <HI>you</HI> tell JAMES that <HI>I</HI> will NOT have his fortune. Bid him leave it to his RELATIONS, I WON'T have it."</Q> Sir John, on hearing this, bequeathed it to the old Chevalier de St. George—so, of course, his relations got it. He had, after Bishop Berkeley went to Cloyne, boceme a Papist. A very long letter of Bishop Berkeley to Sir John James on that occasion is one of the letters which will compose part of the second volume of "Berkeley's Literary Relics," if it is ever printed; as also a very curious singular case of conscience, submitted <HI>to,</HI> nad determined <HI>by,</HI> another eminent Prelate of the Church of England.</NOTE>, which
was sent to Mr. Berkeley at Christ's College, bequeathing, in
case the House of Stuart should ever come to the throne, and
<PB N="cccclxi" REF="473"/>
<HI>the poor</HI> PROPRIETORS have their estates restored, his WHOLE
property, excepting fortunes to his two daughters, to Bishop
Berkeley's eldest son, and requesting the <HI>possible</HI> King to grant
the title conferred on him by King James, of Baron Mont∣eagle,
<HI>on</HI> the Bishop's son.</P>
<P>Neither Doctor Berkeley nor his Son could ever be per∣suaded
by their friends to go to Court, and be presented,
without any cause calling them thither. Both laughed at
the idea of almost every Country 'Squire, and unpreferred
Divine, going to St. James's. He used to answer one old
friend, who often urged him on the subject, by saying,
<Q REND="inline">"When his Majesty <HI>wants</HI> me, he will send for me; he
knows who I am, and where I live: and my curate (that
surely finest of all fine Preachers, the late pious Mr.
Harmer,) goes frequently, and that is enough."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley felt gratified by a gentleman of his Ma∣jesty's
household once telling him, that, on asking leave of
absence for a few days, his Royal Master asked whither he
was going, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"To Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham."</Q>
His Majesty said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>His Father was an honour to human na∣ture.</HI>"</Q>
His Majesty had not a more active, zealous
friend than Dr. Berkeley; nor certainly a <HI>more disinte∣rested
one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="cccclxii" REF="474"/>
Dr. Berkeley was at a very great expence to disperse his
famous Sermon on the thirtieth of January. Only a few
months before his lamented death he printed the sixth edi∣tion,
on common paper, and had one thousand of them
dispersed over England. On its first publication, it went
through five editions in four weeks. He has repeatedly
told the Editor, that the notes of the fifth edition, in small
duodecimo, not now to be purchased for any sum, are all,
except one, answers to letters, from <Q REND="inline">"Lords and Gentle∣men,"</Q>
some admiring, some with Nicodemus, enquiring,
<Q REND="inline">"How can these things be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the third chapter of the Holy Gospel, as recorded by Saint John.</NOTE>?"</Q> To have answered all the
letters received on that Sermon, he said, would have taken
a ream of paper. One from the Editor's, not Dr. Berke∣ley's,
<HI>old</HI> acquaintance, Soame Jenyns, written a very short
time before the death of that entertaining, agreeable, great
genius, and, at length, devout Christian, is carefully pre∣served
by the Editor, who lately found an odd glove in her
cabinet, that happened to be dropped by a beloved friend
the last time she ever visited her, about twenty years ago.
The Editor has a picture of her friend, and other <HI>souve∣nirs;</HI>
yet the glove is still preserved with care. Why is it?
perhaps it brings the <HI>last</HI> idea of the beloved object to the
mind. One knows not why else. Perhaps the <HI>mind</HI> of
<PB N="cccclxiii" REF="475"/>
man can never be fully defined by <HI>man;</HI> yet it is a delight∣ful
study surely, next to observing the wonderful ways of
PROVIDENCE. Of <HI>both,</HI> like the late Queen of Prussia on her
death-bed, as related by her Royal Descendant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg," written by the late King of Prussia.</NOTE> <HI>before</HI> his
acquaintance with Voltaire, the Editor hopes ere long to
know more.</P>
<P>Perhaps two sincerer, more disinterested patriots, have
not existed in <HI>any</HI> country, at <HI>any</HI> time, than Bishop Berke∣ley
and his son Dr. Berkeley, both very great politicians.
The Bishop publicly, his son more quietly, frequently
suggested hints to the minister for the time being, for
the benefit of the country, some of which he had the
pleasure of seeing were attended to, although the let∣ters,
when the advice was thus conveyed, were generally
anonymous, he using to say, <Q REND="inline">"If the advice is wise, a man
of sense will attend to it, come how it may;"</Q> adding,
<Q REND="inline">"I write frequently to Mr. Pitt, and sometimes send him a
message."</Q> Dr. Berkeley suggested, and it was attended to,
some additional benefit for the poor common soldiers. The
Editor is no politician—not that she does not esteem
<HI>females equal</HI> to politics. Sir Robert Walpole used to say,
that an old friend of the Editor's Father, Mrs. Waller,
of Hall-Barn, near Beaconsfield, grandmother of the pre∣sent
<PB N="ccccxliv" REF="476"/>
Mr. Waller, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>understood the interests of this nation better
than any man in it.</HI>"</Q> Mrs. Waller, a daughter of old
Aislabie's, had a very superior understanding.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley was universally admired as a letter-wri∣ter;
he wrote such <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor fears to set down, lest it should seem incredible, during Archbishop Secker's life, the annual amount of the postage of Dr. Berkeley's letters—(the Editor always keeps the letter-accompt separate, and an heavy enough accompt it is most years, even her own now—when her beloved friends were living, it was sometimes quite frightful)—and, after his Grace's death, numbers of persons, who had never seen his face, wrote to him to re∣quest his advice how to get a place or preferment. He benevolently answered them all, and generally directed them into a track that led them right. The plan he pursued was once practised <HI>against</HI> himself. At the election of the late amiable Lord Lichfield, when standing for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford, during the reign of George the Second, his Lordship, being an honest Tory, was likely to be <HI>hard-run.</HI> His Lordship lamenting one day to a relation of the Editor, the late sensible cynical Richard Rowney, Esquire, Fellow of All-Souls College, that he feared Mr. Berkeley, of Christ College, would not vote for him, asked if Mr. Powney had any interest with Dr. Berkeley, just then made Vicar of Bray (Ive's Place is in Bray Parish). The Editor's acute kinsman replied, that he could not take the liberty to ask Mr. Berkeley for his vote; but added, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I can put you</HI> in a way to SECURE IT, if you are acquainted with the Archbishop of Canterbury."</Q>—Lord Lichfield replied, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, in∣timately so."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! then, I'll <HI>promise you</HI> Mr. Berkeley's vote.—Go <HI>yourself</HI> to Lambeth, and request his Grace to <HI>ask</HI> Mr. Berkeley to vote for you."</Q> The advice was exactly followed. The Editor has repeatedly heard Dr. Berke∣ley relate to various persons—(it happened before she was acquainted with Dr. Berkeley)—the Archbishop wrote to Dr. Berkeley (the letter still exists); Dr. Berkeley answered it <HI>per</HI> return of post, telling his Grace that, according to <HI>one</HI> statute he had sworn to observe, Lord Lichfield was not eligible; and, al∣though he respected Lord Lichfield, his conscience would not permit him to vote for him—that he had always determined not to vote <HI>against</HI> him; and most sincerely wished he might be elected Chancellor. Soon after Dr. Berkeley went to stay at Lambeth, he told his Grace that such a statute said so and so. His Grace replied, <Q REND="inline">"HAH! I believe it may; but I never understood it so before. You were (or are) quite right, Sir, in not voting for Lord Lichfield; for, according to that, he is (or was)—(the Editor forgets whether this conversa∣tion was prior, or subsequent, to the election) QUITE RIGHT IN NOT voting for his Lordship."</Q>—As the Editor does not read Latin, <HI>she</HI> is no judge of this matter; but she knows it is happy for the poor patients in the Infirmary that his Lordship was Chancellor.</NOTE> numbers so alertly for his friends and
<PB N="cccclxv" REF="477"/>
common acquaintances to serve them: indeed the chief
business of the <HI>trio,</HI> Father, Son, and Grandson, seemed
to be, to assist, serve, and benefit every one but <HI>themselves.</HI></P>
<P>It is supposed, by many that knew him through life, in
early life, and until nearly the latest period of life, that
Dr. Berkeley had, by his advice, direction, and assistance,
made the fortunes of more men, than any private person,
not in station to do it, than any man in the three king∣doms,
so as sometimes to occasion Mrs. Berkeley to say to
him, <Q REND="inline">"My dear friend, you can make every man's fortune,
or put him in train to do it himself, <HI>but your son's:</HI> why
do you not try to get some appointment for him, to help
him, until he can, at least <HI>will</HI> help himself, by going
to the Bar?"</Q> His constant reply was, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! no, poor
fellow; I cannot ask any thing for him, or for myself.
He must make his own fortune for me. God may raise
him some friends."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccclxvi" REF="478"/>
Mr. Monck Berkeley, by his Mother's earnest advice to
him in youth, never meddled with politics; she always
telling him, it was time enough if ever he should be in a
station to require it. How many creatures stamp them∣selves
for fools, by bawling for or against a party, when
they have hardly left bawling for a good whipping!</P>
<P>A gentleman, many years ago, said to the Editor,
<Q REND="inline">"What a man Dr. Berkeley is!"</Q> The day before yes∣terday,
at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, some public dinner, it was said, that
an officer, one of the company, was going to Ireland. Some
one asked, <Q REND="inline">"if he had many acquaintances in that king∣dom."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Not one."</Q>—Dr. Berkeley politely asked, <Q REND="inline">"in
what part the Colonel's regiment was quartered?"</Q> and
then said, <Q REND="inline">"I will do myself the pleasure of giving you
two letters, Sir, that perhaps may be of some little ser∣vice
to you, although they are very hospitable in Ireland."</Q>
He called for pen, ink, and paper, twirled his chair round
to a small table, and in, I think, little more than five mi∣nutes,
produced two such letters to the Colonel, (we all
talking and babbling the whole time,) as I am sure I could
not have written in five hours. <Q REND="inline">"My G-d! what a clever
fellow he is!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Frinsham sometimes, when going into the library,
and seeing half a score letters lying on the table, would say,
<Q REND="inline">"Well, well! what a pity it was your father did not <HI>put</HI>
<PB N="cccclxvii" REF="479"/>
<HI>you 'prentice to be Secretary of State.</HI> You would have
<HI>scribbled</HI> away <HI>so finely</HI> to all the <HI>princes</HI> and <HI>potentates,</HI> that
it would have <HI>done their hearts good</HI> to read your epistles."</Q>
To which, as when many persons have said, <Q REND="inline">"How re∣markably
Dr. Berkeley's talents seem calculated for the
diplomatic line!"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"My dear Donna Anna, (Mrs. Frin∣sham's
nick-name amongst her intimate friends,) I would
not <HI>have</HI> been put <HI>'prentice</HI> to any thing but a clergyman,
<HI>no,</HI> not if at twenty-two and an half I had received a re∣velation
from Heaven, that I never should have had any
thing more than a curacy of forty pounds a year through
life."</Q></P>
<P>Not many days before Dr. Berkeley's lamented death, the
Editor consoling him with the delightful thought, that he had
been a most zealous preacher of Christ, not elegant MORAL
essays from Plutarch or Seneca; he lifted up his still ex∣quisitely
fine eyes on her, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"I have, my dear,
and HE knows I preached him in SINCERITY. <HI>You know</HI> I
always <HI>dreaded</HI> being a popular preacher. I never wished
to please men from the pulpit."</Q></P>
<P>Bishop Berkeley and his grandson both assumed an
additional motto of their own choosing, as did Mr.
Cherry—<Q REND="inline">"CONSCIENTIA MILLE TESTES."</Q> Dr. Berkeley
contented himself with the beautiful blessed one of his ances∣tors,
<Q REND="inline">"DIEU AVEC NOUS."</Q> The Bishop's was, <Q REND="inline">"NON
<PB N="cccclxviii" REF="480"/>
SIBI, SED TOTI."</Q> Mr. Monck Berkeley's, assumed by
him when he was about or rather under twenty, on an al∣most
miraculous preservation of the life of himself, two
other gentlemen, his intimate friends, still living, and their
postillion and horses, <Q REND="inline">"VIVAT POST FUNERA VIRTUS;"</Q>
which he engraved in the strings of his crest, as is seen in
the print prefixed to the Poems. That Mr. Berkeley, from
his cradle, or rather <HI>no</HI> cradle, as has been before stated,
to his coffin, had numerous hair-breadth escapes from death,
has been mentioned. Some time <HI>after</HI> his death two
<HI>very extraordinary</HI> things occurred, which will not be here
related; one very soon after his interment, to an entire
stranger to every thing but his name, having never even
<HI>seen him;</HI> the other to his Mother, about five months after
his decease.</P>
<P>The Editor again begs pardon for trespassing so long on
the public; and wishes that she resembled her excellent
Son in many instances, particularly in burning without
mercy, not, as he did, whole quires at a time of beautiful
Essays, Poems, &amp;c. for in early youth <HI>her manuscripts</HI>
consisted only of innumerable letters to friends, which she
trusts they consigned to the flames, and a diary of her own
<HI>very unimportant</HI> life, from the age of seventeen, when,
being a very early riser in summer, and her mother never
coming out of her closet to <HI>breakfast</HI> until ten o'clock; for
the family prayers at Mr. Frinsham's were (the Editor
<PB N="cccclxix" REF="481"/>
thinks very inconveniently) not offered up until <HI>after</HI> break∣fast,
when trades-people are coming, and the door must
be answered, in private families—excepting at the house of
the late excellent Mr. and Mrs. Peirce, of Windsor Forest,
who, either in town or country, never suffered even the
kitchen-maid, or groom, to answer the door until prayers,
lessons, and psalms, were gone through. At Lambeth
Palace, during Archbishop Secker's life, every servant, in∣cluding
the <HI>porter,</HI> went into the chapel at nine in the
morning. Dr. Berkeley and the Editor, when resident at
Acton, were one morning a very few minutes too late—the
footman dismounted, and knocked violently—Dr.
Berkeley assured him it was in vain; so the glasses were drawn
up, and in about half an hour the gates were opened. The
Editor, on her marriage, found the custom at Dr. Berkeley's
much better, that of assembling before breakfast, at nine
o'clock, perhaps not always quite so punctually to a <HI>minute;</HI>
as did, for more than half a century, the pious mother of
that just Judge Sir W. H. Ashhurst. What a blessing
to individuals, sometimes to thousands, is a wise, pious
mother!</P>
<P>The Editor has frequently heard her mother say, <Q REND="inline">"that
the mother of Judge Buller, although the daughter of
Bishop Trelawny, was an angel on earth"</Q>—she has been
one in heaven almost half a century. The late worthy,
charitable Marchioness of Abercorn was a grand-daughter
<PB N="cccclxx" REF="482"/>
of this lady. The <HI>poor</HI> lamented bitterly at the death of
both these ladies.</P>
<P>The Editor's idea is, perhaps, in <HI>most</HI> things, an <HI>almost</HI>
universal one, <HI>to take most care of the most valuable things.</HI>
She takes more care of a little fine Dresden china, than
she does of her milk-pans; and, as she used frequently to
tell her dear, amiable, old friend the late Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,
when he used to tell her, <Q REND="inline">"that she took too much care of
her soul, going to church on week-days and Sunday after∣noons;
that it were better to stay and chat with her
friends."</Q> Her constant reply was, <Q REND="inline">"This little, <HI>insigni∣ficant</HI>
frame of mine <HI>must be laid in the dust one day or
other,</HI> sooner or later; but the <HI>little spark</HI> within <HI>must</HI>
exist FOR EVER: therefore <HI>I</HI> must take some <HI>little</HI> care about
it, say what you will; and if <HI>I</HI> cannot make <HI>you</HI> take a
little more care of the spark that animates <HI>your noble</HI> case,
why hereafter <HI>I</HI> shall be <HI>noble,</HI> and <HI>you ignoble.</HI>"</Q> Alas! dear
amiable friend, my mind cannot follow thee with delight be∣yond
thy grave, but leave thee in the hands of HIM that
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>judgeth right.</HI>"</Q> Thou certainly wert not of the number
of those to whom the Psalmist prays God <Q REND="inline">"<HI>not</HI> to be mer∣ciful;"</Q>
for thou didst NOT <Q REND="inline">"<HI>offend of malicious wickedness.</HI>"</Q>
Thou wert neither <HI>profane, Deist,</HI> nor <HI>Arian.</HI> Thou hadst
a simple, ignorant, thoughtless mother, and no father from
five years old.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclxxi" REF="483"/>
If the Editor, by any thing contained in these sheets,
should induce <HI>any,</HI> in a certain rank of life, of her fair (she
corrects herself, she means her RED countrywomen, for <HI>al∣most</HI>
all are now become ROUGE DRAGONS,) to attend a
<HI>little</HI> to the education of their children, and not devolve
that <HI>very very</HI> important charge upon, in general, a poor,
ignorant, low-lived, <HI>foreign</HI> animal, with no other recom∣mendation
than that she <HI>cannot</HI> speak <HI>English</HI>—</P>
<P>It has been of late years much the fashion to decry
schools for girls. The Editor, (notwithstanding the wish of
her amiable friend Lord Lyttelton, that she might have
<Q REND="inline">"half a dozen girls to educate,"</Q>) having neither daughter
nor niece, and not very intimate with many of her
kindred that have girls, knows little of schools; but thus
much she knows of <HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>French</HI> governesses, that
the schools must be <HI>bad indeed,</HI> if not better than <HI>these

<P>The Swiss <HI>gouvernante</HI> at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s used regularly, when

some of her more distant friends, the farmers' <HI>ladies.</HI> This
the Editor knows from ocular demonstration. The follow∣ing
<PB N="cccclxxii" REF="484"/>
fact was many years ago related with horror to the
Editor by Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>:</P>
<P>Going one morning in town to call on her cousin-ger∣man,
the late Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, who not being up, sent her
little girl, aged eight years, to entertain her; the young
lady soon began <HI>such</HI> a conversation as was terrifying. On
being asked, <Q REND="inline">"what could make her talk thus?"</Q></P>
<P>Young Lady.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, to make you laugh."</Q></P>
<P>Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>.—<Q REND="inline">"Make me laugh, child! Why, I am
ready to run up the chimney, I am so frightened to
hear you. Whom have you ever heard talk so? tell me
directly, or I will tell your Mamma."</Q></P>
<P>Young Lady.—<Q REND="inline">"Why Mademoiselle, and Papa's Gen∣tleman;
and they do laugh so at it, that I thought it
would make you laugh."</Q></P>
<P>This ill-fated, ill-educated young Lady, when <HI>com∣pletely</HI>
educated, made Mamma weep, instead of Made∣moiselle
laugh.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, soon after she married
Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, told several of her friends, <Q REND="inline">"that she won∣dered

spent every evening, whilst the family were in town, in a
<HI>night-cellar</HI> with her governess, when her <HI>careful</HI> mother
thought her in bed."</Q></P>
<P>This unhappy woman has been long divorced, and is not
<HI>re</HI>-married. She was some few years ago at a water-drinking
place, no living soul noticing her, an object of great com∣passion
to the Editor, who, never doing <HI>any</HI> thing in haste,
was meditating on calling upon her; but a very few days
ended those charitable meditations; for her Ladyship, alas
for her, poor creature! was soon exhibited leaning on the arm
of an <HI>hostler.</HI> Ah me! her careless mother must one day
meet this injured, cast-off daughter, and hear her call aloud
for vengeance on her horrid cruel negligence. What will
she then do!!!</P>
<P>A few years ago, a lady asked the Editor, if she was
acquainted with Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. She answered, <Q REND="inline">"I have
not that honour. I only know and revere, as all must
do, her great worthiness of character."</Q> The Lady re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"Alas-a-day! a friend of hers is almost frantic on
her account. She has got a devil incarnate for governess
to Lady Charlotte. It is certainly known that in her

a creature, and has so wound herself in by her
seeming worthiness with Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, that she will not

believe a syllable against her, although she has heard it
from several of her friends; and, I think, you might
perhaps find some method to convince Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> what
a <HI>wretch</HI> she is."</Q> The Editor assured Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> that
she was unequal to the task; it must, for her, be left
to God. Probably his mercy kept the wretch's mask on;
for Lady Charlotte has been married several years, and
the Editor has not seen <HI>her</HI> name in the newspapers, as
being handed up to Doctors Commons. May she never
carry any grist to that mill, not for grinding <HI>old</HI> women
young, but reducing <HI>young</HI> women to a <HI>worse</HI> condition than
even old ones!</P>

<Q REND="inline">"Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as

delight the Editor, if she thought that any of the
fine ladies and fine gentlemen, described in the first ten
verses of the fifth chapter of the Prophecy, of Jeremiah,
who may chance to read this whilst their hair is dressing,
may be benefited by it; it being customary with many
<PB N="cccclxxv" REF="487"/>
people to read some <HI>trumpery</HI> book at that time; the

powder and pomatum would spoil a good one, to her
maid, which, she hopes, benefits both parties; she
means it should, as she explains as she reads, or rather
when she is requested to lay down the book, because, while
the frizzing, &amp;c. is performing, the reading cannot go on,
especially as the Editor is short-sighted.</P>
<P>It is now and then some consolation to the Editor, (who
hopes these nations may be spared from French brutality
a little longer, at least till she has made her exit,) when

fair (now RED) sex. The Editor recollects that there <HI>is</HI> a
text in her <HI>old-fashioned</HI> book, a kind of THREAT to ladies:
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>thou rendest thy face with</HI> PAINTING."</Q>—It is, we see, so
<HI>very old-fashioned,</HI> one wonders that fine <HI>ton</HI> ladies practise
it. The poor old <HI>immensely</HI> vulgar Editor does honestly
own, it <HI>ever did, ever must,</HI> whilst she retains her senses,
occasion her <HI>not respecting,</HI> although she <HI>loves,</HI> some who
do it.</P>
<P>As the Editor is writing this, her sister is reading to her
the direful catastrophe of Lord C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>. About three
years ago, the Editor was told by her friends, that she ought
to write a Preface to her dear Son's Poems; when she deter∣mined
to give the opinion of two wise men, and her <HI>own,</HI> al∣though
an imbecile female, of a book which Dr. Berkeley
declared he esteemed to be the first, the best, work of this
century. Mr. Monck Berkeley said, that if young men of <HI>sense</HI>
<PB N="cccclxxvii" REF="489"/>
would read it <HI>only cursorily, that it must</HI> prevent their gambling.
The Editor, charmed with it on reading only thirty-five pages
of the first volume, then at Canterbury, laid it down, put
on her hat and cloak, and posted off into the city, to the
bookseller's, to subscribe, for herself,—her sister, then at her
own abode,—and her Son, then abroad. Mrs. Berkeley,
ever delighting to benefit her fellow creatures, in her <HI>very
narrow sphere,</HI> did many of her friends the <HI>kindness</HI> to
<HI>compel</HI> them to subscribe to "A Treatise on SUICIDE,
GAMING, and DUELLING, by the Reverend Charles
Moore, of Boughton Blean, Kent." The Editor used con∣stantly,
when soliciting subscriptions, after the publication
of the first incomparable volume, to say, <Q REND="inline">"It is for your
<HI>own</HI> sake, not Mr. Moore's, although he is a very old ac∣quaintance,
a very highly respected friend."</Q> On Dr.
Berkeley's going to Cookham in the summer, Mrs. Berkeley
invited several of her Berkshire friends and neighbours to
subscribe. Among these was her very worthy respected
neighbour Lady Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, who replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my
dear Mrs. Berkeley, <HI>I can't afford it.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Can't afford
it! Poor soul! Shall <HI>I lend you a Guinea?</HI>—Why, I
did not bring my husband <HI>quite</HI> fourscore thousand
pounds, and yet <HI>I</HI> have afforded it, who laid it down
as a rule, since I had children, never to buy a book but
at a stall. I do not think my friend Sir George will either
thrash or scold you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, no; but I can't afford it."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley declared she would not lend it her, unless she
<PB N="cccclxxviii" REF="490"/>
<HI>would</HI> subscribe; another neighbour did, as the sequel of
the little tale will shew. Two or three evenings after Mrs.
Berkeley called on Lady Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, to ask if she would take
a walk with her, to view the progress of her Ladyship's cas∣tle
of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, then building. On the servant's an∣nouncing
Mrs. Berkeley, her Ladyship sprang from the so∣pha,
exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I am <HI>so</HI> happy to see
you, you cannot imagine. I have been this hour deter∣mining
every minute to go to you, to ask if I am too
late to subscribe to Mr. Moore. It is surely the most ex∣cellent
book I have redde a long time. Do pray take
my Guinea"—(all that Mr. Moore would suffer to be
paid for those two excellent volumes in quarto.)—"I was
not able to quit it; and luckily you are come!"</Q></P>
<P>The Editor would not take this Lady's subscription; for
she never receives any money but what is her own due, lest,
as she tells her friends, as we say in Scotland, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>She is not
o'er rich,</HI>"</Q> she should forget, and spend it on herself; to
prevent which, when compelled to be <HI>treasurer</HI> for any
friend for a few weeks, she always seals it up, and
writes on it to whom it belongs. She, however,
promised to write directly to her worthy old acquaintance,
Mr. Rivington, to learn about the matter; and the name
of POOR Lady Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> appears in the additional list of
subscribers.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclxxix" REF="491"/>
Some time afterwards this worthy friend of the Editor,
at her request, procured a very advantageous appointment
in the army in India for the eldest son of Mr. Moore, who,
although a very excellent scholar, as Dr. Berkeley told the
Editor, was resolved to be a warrior; and we had then
happy days<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor, although No politician, is <Q REND="inline">"clearly for carrying on the war,"</Q> until there is <HI>some</HI> established government in France with whom to make peace; or peace may be much more <HI>horrible</HI> than war. It is like a <HI>silly</HI> girl <HI>marrying because</HI> she has a <HI>stern</HI> father or a <HI>cross</HI> mother. Poor souls!!!</NOTE>, no war of our own in Europe. Mr. Moore
and his Lady, and, the Editor dares believe, the young gentle∣man,
felt great gratitude to good Lady Y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, for exerting
her influence with her brother-in-law, Sir J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>.
The Editor wishes that, for the benefit of society, Mr Moore
would put forth an edition in half-crown numbers. There
are anecdotes enough to furnish a fine print for <HI>every</HI> num∣ber;
for, as Mr. Monck Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"it is as en∣tertaining
as a novel, with this difference, that the facts
are real, and as pious as Thomas à Kempis."</Q> Thousands
would then read and profit by it, who otherwise will never
hear of it.</P>
<P>Bishop Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"If I had the voice of Sten∣tor,
I would become hoarse in calling on all, particularly
on persons of high rank, <HI>Take care of the education of your
children.</HI>"</Q> If my Lord M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s has done so, he may

James's without horror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a most excellent sermon of the pious, learned Dr. Doddridge, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>on children's turning out wicked.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>; "if not, perhaps it might be wise
in him to place himself in the situation, before the throne of
mercy, in which, thirty-six years ago, in the summer of 1760,
he thought proper to place Mr. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, a very respectable
Gloucestershire gentleman, at the Swan Inn at Cheltenham,
on <HI>both</HI> his knees, begging this GREAT man's pardon; not
only all the gentlemen who dined there witnessing it, but all
the town, the sashes being up, standing on each others'
shoulders, to behold so wonderfully NOBLE a conduct.</P>
<P>At the time when this circumstance happened, the Edi∣tor
and her sister were returning, from drinking tea at the
rooms, to their lodgings below the Swan Inn, such a
crowd none could pass; after waiting some time, they
desired their footman to push through, and learn what
occasioned this violent concourse. After some time, the
servant returned (he was a very worthy Gloucestershire
man, so knew Mr. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>) saying, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, Madam! it is
young Mr. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, upon his knees, begging pardon
of an Officer."</Q></P>
<P>Both the Miss Frinshams at the same instant.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Upon his
knees?</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="cccclxxxi" REF="493"/>Servant.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Madam; and he is making a long
speech; and all the gentlemen are standing round
them, looking very grave."</Q></P>
<P>The next morning the walks echoed with this wonderful
transaction.</P>
<P>Three of the Editor's old, intimate friends, the late Sir
William and Sir Septimius (then Colonel) Robinson, and
the sensible, worthy Philip Sharpe, Esquire, Clerk of the Privy
Council, lamented over Mr. C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s having unluckily
said, <Q REND="inline">"that he understood not the use of the sword, could not
fight;"</Q> that declaration, all present agreed, produced the
genuflexion. Cheltenham rang with this NOBLE deed during
the season. It determined the Editor, then a young single
woman, that if ever she did marry, and should produce a
son, <HI>he</HI> should learn to <HI>use</HI> a sword, although she trusted he
might never meet with a son of the noble M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, never
draw it in any private quarrel.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley had the honour, the <HI>pleasure,</HI> to
be well known to the <Q REND="inline">"sweet, amiable Lord L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,"</Q>
eldest son of the M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, as he termed him, on the
Editor's asking, in her wonted way, <Q REND="inline">"What is he or she
like?"</Q> It may be hoped, this dire calamity may bring
this NOBLE M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> on <HI>his</HI> knees.</P>
<P><PB N="cccclxxxii" REF="494"/>
The idea of a nobleman or gentleman upon their knees
to <HI>any</HI> BUT God, brings to the Editor's mind a circumstance
of a noble Duke upon his knees (not to beg pardon), re∣peatedly
related to her by her Mother.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned before, that the great controver∣sial
writer, Charles Leslie, great-grandson of the excellent
Bishop of Rothes, the only <HI>Scotch</HI> friend of the unfortunate
Queen Mary, as good Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was her
only English one, spent much time at Mr. Cherry's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Leslie was staying with Mr. Cherry, at his house in town, at the time of the great storm in 1703. Mr. Cherry's Lady always, winter as well as summer, rose every morning at six o'clock, until within two years of her death at 68, when she lay till seven. She never went to rest till between twelve and one. Her daughter, Mrs. Frinsham, and one of her grand-daughters, not the Editor, could live almost without sleep. Mrs. Cherry used to say, <HI>finches</HI> were early birds. In the morning, at half-past five, when the house-maid went in, to light Mrs. Cherry's fire, Mr. Leslie followed her in, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Is the report true, or are
my good friends living?"</Q> Both at once blessed the mercy of God that they were. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"The whole street have been up all night, except your∣selves, and are telling each other, 'Ah! poor Mr. Cherry's family, they are all killed, servants and all.' I lay till my bed was quite covered with bricks from the chimney—I then got up, and went to the farther corner, and have sat there ever since the first hour."</Q> Mr. Cherry had gone up to see after his little girls—their excellent French governess entreated him not to awake them, so they slept through it.</NOTE>,
where she had often heard the following little anecdote
related by Mr. Leslie; as the origin of Mr. Leslie's <Q REND="inline">"FOUR
SHORT MARKS"</Q> to ascertain the truth of historic facts re∣lated
<PB N="cccclxxxiii" REF="495"/>
as having past long since; and which, the Editor has
repeatedly heard from many learned men, cost the late Dr.
Conyers Middleton twenty years' trying, but all in vain, to
refute.</P>
<P>An excellent lady, a friend of Mr. Cherry, was very inti∣mate
with the then Duke of Leeds, who was a Deist. They
often disputed on the subject. The lady happened one
day to lament that, although the Duke would never per∣vert
her to Deism, she should never be able to convert him
to Christianity, for he took all her arguments to pieces. In
short, his Grace was a better logician than the lady, who
said, <Q REND="inline">"Now, if Mr. Leslie would teach me some arguments,
I could urge them, and perhaps rescue my noble friend
from his sad error."</Q> Mr. Leslie replied, <Q REND="inline">"I will endea∣vour
to furnish you with some arguments, that, if his
Grace has an <HI>honest</HI> mind, will convince him of the truth
of Revelation."</Q> Accordingly, the <HI>four marks</HI> were given
to her, and she soon produced them to her noble friend.</P>
<P>The next morning, as early as it was proper to send to a
fine lady, perhaps <HI>rather</HI> earlier at the end of the seventeenth
than at the close of the eighteenth century, the Duke sent
to request that the lady would have the goodness to desire
the gentleman who had written that paper to visit him
with her. On Mr. Leslie's entering the apartment the
<PB N="cccclxxxiv" REF="496"/>
Duke went towards him, and, like Cornelius to Saint
Peter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, chap. x.</NOTE>, fell on his knees, burst into tears, thanked him,
and besought him to pray to God to forgive the having
lived so long in ignorance and error; said that he had sat
up the whole night, reading it over and over, impa∣tient
for the arrival of the morning, to see and bless the
hand that had rescued him from eternal misery.</P>
<P>Whoever has as honest a mind as this wise excellent
Duke, may read these FOUR MARKS, almost <HI>verbatim,</HI> tran∣scribed
by the pious Mr. Nelson, in <HI>the Monday and
Tuesday in Whitsun-Week,</HI> in his "Feasts and Fasts." The
very learned late Reverend Meredith Jones, Rector of
Guestling, Prebendary of Chichester, Chaplain to the present
Bishop of Chichester, in a most incomparable work of his,
written when a young man, without his name, and printed
for B. White in 1758, says, <Q REND="inline">"I defy any <HI>honest</HI> Arian not
to be convinced by the proofs here produced."</Q> The book
is almost as scarce as it is excellent. It proves that the
filiation of the SAVIOUR of the WORLD did <HI>not</HI> commence
until after the angel Gabriel had been sent to the Blessed
Virgin. The excellent and very deeply learned Mr.
Romaine says, that the distinction in the Trinity, of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, are only <HI>office</HI> names; for he was old-fashioned
enough to believe that, in this Trinity, none was
<PB N="cccclxxxv" REF="497"/>
greater or less than another, &amp;c. (See the Anathasian
Creed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The book on which the witty Frank Coventry has placed his <HI>hero</HI> POMPEY <Q REND="inline">"the little,"</Q> when conversing with his <HI>friend</HI> PUSS, in his old mistress's closet. The Editor cannot here forbear setting down <HI>her idea</HI> of the TRIUNE God at <HI>seven</HI> years old. Earnestly reading on Saints-days, &amp;c. this <HI>old-fashioned</HI> creed, she puzzled her little <HI>over</HI>-inquisitive brain to find out some similitude; at length, standing one evening by the card-table, when the family, &amp;c. were playing quadrille; Basto was played, and, lying some time alone on the table, it occured to her young mind that the ace of clubs was the emblem of the TRIUNE God—this entirely satisfied all her <HI>sceptical</HI> doubts at seven years old, and they have never, blessed be God, troubled her since. It was a wonderfully odd idea for a child; but it entirely delivered her parents from her worrying to explain the Trinity to her.</NOTE>. The very learned Mr. Hawtry has lately published
a similar work for <HI>very</HI> learned persons. Few females of the
Editor's acquaintance, excepting her two old friends and
namesakes Mesdames Eliza Carter and Eliza Lawrence—the
latter styled by Dr. Johnson <Q REND="inline">"The English Sappho"</Q>—are,
perhaps, qualified to understand all its merits. Probably
not the learned Miss <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, (of whom the Editor has heard
her son speak,) who have a little Greek, <Q REND="inline">"a little learning is
a dangerous thing,"</Q> would always call the Roman orator
<HI>Kickero.</HI>—A boy should have received a <HI>kick</HI> for such folly.
Mr. Monck Berkeley detested every kind of affection as
much as his Mother. He delighted much in the conversa∣tion
of the two above-named, uncommonly sensible, as well
as very learned ladies. The Editor has frequently heard
Dr. Berkeley say, he would prefer, were he to publish a
Greek work, the criticism of Miss Eliza Lawrence, now
<PB N="cccclxxxvi" REF="498"/>
Lady of the member for Canterbury, to most men he
knew. These two <HI>really</HI> learned ladies are also two of the
best housewives that the Editor knows.—She thinks that,
in that <HI>absolutely necessary</HI> knowledge, both these learned
ladies <HI>equal</HI> her ignorant <HI>self!!!</HI></P>
<P>The title of Mr. Meredith Jones's work is, "The Doctrine
of the TRINITY, as it stands deduced by the Light of
REASON, from the DATA laid down in the SCRIPTURES;
to which are added, some Remarks on the ARIAN CON∣TROVERSY;
also a POSTSCRIPT, containing some Observa∣tions
on the Writings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus."</P>
<P>The Editor trusts, for her own sake, as well as that of
others, that she draws near a conclusion of this <HI>very</HI> long
Preface, not quite unexampled; for one of the acutest wri∣ters
of the latter end of the last century, that wonderful
genius Charles Leslie, in his incomparable book, intituled,
"THE SNAKE IN THE GRASS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps it might not be amiss if some of our learned Divines, who are such strenuous advocates for <HI>universal unlimited</HI> toleration to <HI>all</HI> the open and <HI>sly</HI> underminers of the excellent Church of England—until she, as in the last century, receives <HI>her</HI> toleration from them, when Archbishop Usher taught school for a groat a week, and two poor suffragan Bishops, Joseph Hall and Jeremy Taylor, for two-pence a week—if these learned modern Divines would take a hint from an aged Matron, and, now that Leslie's Snake is coming <HI>boldly out</HI> of the grass, just peep upon him <HI>in</HI> the grass—they might be better prepared to encounter his <HI>hissing.</HI></NOTE>, has made his preface con∣siderably
<PB N="cccclxxxvii" REF="499"/>
longer than the Work itself. The Editor is con∣scious
that she ought hardly to presume to write <HI>her</HI> name in
the same paragraph with that great man; yet is certain that
she has the happiness to resemble him in <HI>one</HI> thing—a most
ardent wish to advance the glory of GOD and the salvation
of souls. She hopes for pardon, at least from those <Q REND="inline">"who
never give themselves the time or trouble to <HI>consider</HI> whe∣ther
they have souls to be saved or not."</Q></P>
<P>A young man, now no longer an inhabitant of this sublu∣nary
world, on being one day asked if a friend of his had any
religion, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Of all the <HI>young</HI> men of my acquaintance,
I do not in my conscience believe that, excepting <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,
there is one that ever gives himself the time
or trouble to think <HI>whether</HI> he has a soul to be saved!"</Q>
Every one has redde the request of a pious dying father
to a thoughtless dissipated son—to retire for one half hour
every day into a room, without either pen, ink, or book.
We are told it had the desired effect—he was COMPELLED
to THINK.</P>
<P>The Editor being old-fashioned, and vulgar enough to
believe a future state of rewards and punishments, and
wonderfully addicted, when she loses a friend or an ac∣quaintance,
in idea to follow them over <Q REND="inline">"the dark irremiable
flood,"</Q> the river of death, and to rejoice that, <Q REND="inline">"whether
they would hear, or whether they would forbear"</Q>—for
<PB N="cccclxxxviii" REF="500"/>
the <HI>generality</HI> are most <Q REND="inline">"<HI>thoughtless,</HI>"</Q> that she has suggested
to them, that it <HI>might</HI> be wise to <HI>think</HI> a <HI>little about</HI> it now
and then, lest, like the wretched Lord Chesterfield, they
should, when too late, experience what he certainly said,

And some years after, not long before his death,
<Q REND="inline">"I have a frightful long journey to take in the <HI>dark,</HI>
and I do not know one step of the way."</Q> Could one of
those friends <HI>return</HI> to earth, <HI>how</HI> would they reproach those
who forbore to warn them to flee to the only TRUE con∣solation
in TIME, and through the countless NEVER-ending
ages of ETERNITY.</P>
<P>The Editor, ever addicted to scribbling, to composing—for
she amused herself with writing two <HI>sermons</HI> at <HI>eleven</HI>
years old—has long been in the habit of composing prayers
for her own <HI>sole</HI> use, not for her own <HI>sole</HI> benefit—takes
leave here to subjoin a part of one used by her <HI>every</HI> morn∣ing,
as soon as she opens her eyes, and, to her wonder,

prayer of ARMINE NICHOL, the famous pious German
maid servant, now as much higher, as she was here holier,
than, perhaps, any of her contemporary Princesses of the
whole Germanic body. That every one who reads this may
profit by it, is the ardent wish of the Editor, <HI>Eliza Berkeley.</HI></P>
<P>Of Mr. Monck Berkeley's genius many of those who
read what he has written may be competent judges. To
attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability, generosity,
and nobleness of his heart, the wonderful strength and sound∣ness
of his judgement, the brilliancy of his imagination and
ready wit, his wonderful wilfulness in youth, the great
steadiness of his temper, and the exquisite loveliness of his
nature, even in very early youth, would fill a small volume,
which would be an entertaining one, and would require the
<HI>knowledge</HI> of the Writer of this Preface, and the <HI>pen</HI> of
his favourite Dr. Johnson.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, like the excellent, Honourable Captain
Hamilton, of the Lancaster man of war, father of the
Marquis of Abercorn, never could behold a cloud of distress
on any brow, even on that of a perfect stranger, without
<PB N="ccccxc" REF="502"/>
not only wishing, but even endeavouring, to remedy or
alleviate their sorrows, in which they both often succeeded
with high and low; many curious instances of which might
be related.</P>
<P>Of the excellent, amiable Captain Hamilton, the Editor
has frequently heard his very worthy brother, the Ho∣nourable
and Reverend Mr. Hamilton, Canon of Windsor,
relate the following story, which shall be given in his own
words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"My brother was going one day from town, to dine with
several of his friends at Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s (name forgotten
by the Editor). It was at the time when Westminster
Bridge was either building or repairing. Captain Hamil∣ton
got into the great ferry-boat; after having seated
himself, he observed a middle-aged farmer-like man
sitting with his arms folded, regardless of all that passed;
no one, perhaps, but my excellent brother would have
thought of enquiring into the cause. He spoke to him
two or three times. His answers were as laconic as might
consist with civility. This only served to convince my
brother that the man was under some distress, which it was
possible he might alleviate, <HI>if he could but find it out.</HI> Ac∣cordingly
he requested one of the passengers to exchange
seats with him. He now placed himself close to the poor
man, and said, 'My friend, you seem unhappy."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="ccccxci" REF="503"/>Farmer.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir, I am so.</Q></P>
<P>Capt. H.—<Q REND="inline">"Can I do any thing to relieve you?</Q></P>
<P>Farmer.—<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, I thank you.</Q></P>
<P>Capt. H.—<Q REND="inline">"Do, my poor friend, tell me your distress;
perhaps I may be able to assist you.</Q></P>
<P>Farmer.—<Q REND="inline">"No, Sir, you cannot."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Nobody but <HI>my brother</HI> would, after this, have perse∣vered.
He intreated the man to tell him the cause of
his distress; who began thus:</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Oh! Sir, you are so kind, I must tell you. About a
fortnight ago a man came to my house in Devonshire,
telling me, that a relation of mine had died very rich,
and left me and my brothers his money, but that I must
go to London to see after it, or we should lose it. I took
him in; made him very welcome; and, in a few days,
set out with him for London, mounted on two of my best
horses. He said I must carry a pretty good bag of
money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor thinks it was about £70.</NOTE>, just to fee the lawyers, and bear my expences in
town. I paid the road all the way up. The morning
after we came to town, he took me to Westminster Hall,
where we saw a vast many lawyers in black gowns; but
<PB N="ccccxcii" REF="504"/>
he said his lawyer was not there that day, and we must
go again; but advised me, as he was more used to Lon∣don
than I was, to let him carry the money-bag. We
walked about, a day or two, to look at fine places, and
yesterday we got in one place into a great crowd, and I
lost him. I have been looking for him, and for the inn
where we lodged, and cannot for the life of me find ei∣ther.
I am afraid the man is a rogue, and I shall lose all
my money; but that I do not value, if I could but have
got my poor horses; for they are very fine, and worth a
deal of money."</P>
<P>"My brother asked him, in what part of the town his
inn lay."—He replied, "That, never having been in
town before, he knew not, nor the sign of the inn, only
that it had <HI>great gates.</HI>'—My brother said, 'Well, my
friend, instead of going to my friends, you and I will go
back to London in the boat, and try to find your inn
and your horses.'</P>
<P>"The poor man's countenance brightened. They returned,
set out on this benevolent wild-goose chase, my brother
charging the man to keep fast hold of him if they got into
any crowd. Every inn, from Whitehall, quite through the
City, the Strand, and Holborn, was shewn to him. After
some hours they got into Aldersgate Street, at the upper

the stable, where stood his two fine horses, which the

guineas loose in my pocket, before I gave him the bag to

<P>The angelic-hearted Captain Hamilton left his party to
dine without him, and joined them not until the next day.
It is almost superfluous to add, that, whilst he resided at
Bear-hill House in Berkshire, he was the idol of all his
neighbours, high and low.—He enjoyed the <Q REND="inline">"Peace of
God,"</Q> which made him ever chearful, and he had
wonderful good-will towards man. An attempt to de∣scribe
the sincere lamentations at his early (one must
not presume to add untimely) death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor cannot forbear to insert here part of a letter, written at the time, by an old intimate friend of her early youth—the <HI>learned, benevolent</HI> author <HI>of</HI> "<HI>Christianity not founded on argument.</HI>"—<Q REND="inline">"Your excellent neighbour, poor Captain Hamilton, got on the keel of the boat three times, and was washed off again.

He preached like an Apostle. Upon my word, Christianity <HI>cuts a noble figure</HI> in the hands of such an hero."</Q> A naval officer, not many months ago, told the Editor what she never heard before, that Captain Hamilton had not been drowned at last, but that he was pinioned—he was endeavouring to take off his coat, when the waves washed him off the third time. Who can reget that he went to glory in Heaven so many years sooner than by the course of nature?</NOTE> would be as vain as
fruitless.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccxciv" REF="506"/>
This excellent man lived to Christ, was owned by
him in death, and is now rejoicing with him in glory.
Captain Hamilton was convinced, that not every one that
<HI>saith,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Lord, Lord!"</Q> shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven.
He acted, as well as talked, like a Christian, having con∣stantly
prayers twice every day on-board his ship; and,
when on land, his family was constantly assembled as
often. An eminent Divine says, although Adam's sin does,
yet grace does not, run in the veins. Captain Hamilton's
mother was NOT a saint, <HI>i. e. sancta,</HI> like himself!!!</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's mind, from the time he could articulate,
appeared to be of so very extraordinary and singular a
turn, as determined his Mother to watch over him with the
utmost vigilance, during the time that, to use the language
of the wise Lord Halifax, in his Advice to his Daughter,
<Q REND="inline">"We are entirely under your government, and indeed
through life you have so much influence over us, that it
behoves us to take the greatest care that you (females)
are well educated."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, when grown up, used frequently to say,
<Q REND="inline">"Let a man commit whatever he can, except the not being
<PB N="ccccxcv" REF="507"/>
a good Greek or Latin scholar, my Mother constantly says,
That was his Mother's fault, poor young man!"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley as constantly charged the improper beha∣viour
of young ladies on the father, <HI>if</HI> he was a man who
had lived in the world. It would be cruel to charge it on a
man entirely devoted to study; but there are few such now
amongst persons of a certain rank in society.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, from long observation, saw how naturally
youths are attached to the mother, and girls to the father.
The reason is obvious. The mother is not finding fault
with her Son's slovenly Latin and Greek exercises; nor the
father of the young lady's monkey-tricks, when she should
be learning History, Geography, Drawing, Music, &amp;c. so
much as often to occasion the late excellent Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,
the bosom-friend from early infancy of the Editor, to say
<Q REND="inline">"It was impossible that children, particularly girls, should
love a mother that did her duty as she ought by them."</Q>
She, as her friend always assured her she would, expe∣rienced
the contrary. Her children, when they grew up,
were lovely, and loved her much. She was indeed lovely; she
has frequently wept with vexation, that she had not the
clam, not to be shaken, steadiness of mr. Berkeley's mo∣ther.
It was perhaps, according to the old French pro∣verb,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Dieu donne la robe selon le froid.</HI>"</Q> Mr. Berkeley's
maternal grandfather, with the same lovely nature as Mr.
<PB N="ccccxcvi" REF="508"/>
Berkeley had, when a child of only four years and an half
old, on his father's whipping him the third time for wil∣fulness,
resolved, as the Writer of this Preface has often
heard him say, to tire his father out; and he thought that
about seven or eight times would do it. Luckily for him
his mother intreated his father to give it up: to which
he replied, <Q REND="inline">"No; I will whip him till to-morrow morn∣ing,
rather than let him get the better of me."</Q> THAT
he thought would be <HI>rather</HI> too long; so instantly sub∣mitted.</P>
<P>It was really entertaining to hear from Mr. Berkeley,
when grown up, his wonderfully deep-laid schemes to
conquer his Mother; but he used to add, <Q REND="inline">"I never did
once succeed; yet still I persevered, till reason, pretty
early in life, convinced me of my folly."</Q> He would fre∣quently
exclaim, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! the Wise King was inspired, when
he gave his lessons for education in the book of Proverbs;
and, blessed be God, MY Mother had the sense to make
his directions the rule of her conduct. God knows what
would have become of me by the time I had been ten
years old, with my sort of spirit and temper."</Q></P>
<P>From two years old until the last breath he drew, perhaps
no one ever loved a Mother with such exquisite tenderness
as Mr. Berkeley; of which a million of instances might be
related. Mrs. Berkeley used often to say, on shewing any
<PB N="ccccxcvii" REF="509"/>
curious thing presented to her by Mr. Berkeley, <Q REND="inline">"I am
persuaded, if my Son visited any odd place, where no∣thing
was to be procured but tanned bulls' hides, he
would say, Pray pick out the very best, and send it di∣rected
to Mrs. Berkeley, the Oaks, Canterbury."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley's gratitude to his Father was very great on
several accounts, particularly on two. Mr. Berkeley from a
child, and through life, was an enthusiastic lover of music.
Like most, he was exceedingly anxious to learn to play the
violin, which his Father early, very wisely, told him he
<HI>never</HI> should do; and Mr. Berkeley used always to say,
<Q REND="inline">"He was sure, had he learned, it would have been his
destruction."</Q></P>
<P>In the early part of Mr. Berkeley's life, he played on the
German flute; but an hereditary illness, the asthma, at∣tacked
him at the age of about seventeen. The advice of
the very judicious, worthy Dr. Biddle of Windsor, so entirely
cured him, that he never had a second serious attack. The
Doctor said, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley was the youngest patient he
ever attended in that frightful disorder."</Q> He bade him
lay aside his German flute, and charged him never to give
the view halloo. Mr. Berkeley at that time hunted re∣gularly
twice a week with the buck-hounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Berkeley used frequently, at his return on hunting days, to say, <Q REND="inline">"There is a fellow, a well-mounted butcher, that I longed to knock down. He seems to <HI>delight</HI> in crossing the King, so as really sometimes to endanger his Majesty. <HI>Nothing ever</HI> makes me do it. I wonder what the wretch is made of."</Q> To which Dr. Berkeley used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Why of <HI>bulls' hides,</HI> child, to be sure."</Q> His heart certainly was not cast in the same mould with
the amiable, elegant butcher, standing to represent the town of Hythe in par∣liament, whose conduct on the hustings to the Peer that opposed him is well known to every Kentish person.</NOTE>. He wisely
obeyed both injunctions.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccxcviii" REF="510"/>
The father and mother of Bishop Berkeley, although not
at all related before their marriage (Mrs. Berkeley was
aunt to old General Wolfe, father of the famous General of
that name,) both died in the same week of the asthma,
and were interred at the same time in the same grave.
They were a happy pair through life, and happy in not
being divided in death. It cannot be said, that they died
an untimely death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Old Lady Bannister, aged more than an hundred, grandmother of the late Lady Abdy, when her children and grandchildren were lamenting over her, with her wonted vivacity, said, <Q REND="inline">"Children, don't stand crying and whining over me. I am sure you cannot say that I die <HI>an untimely death.</HI>"</Q>.</NOTE>, both being near ninety. They lived to
breed up six sons, gentlemen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Bishop Berkeley received his school education at Kilkenny. He had, like other boys, cut his name with a knife on some post or table. It was pro∣tected and shewn to strangers. A very few years ago, an Irish gentleman told Dr. Berkeley, that a malicious boy one day cut it clean out, for which the Master flogged him very severely. The Editor does not recollect the name; but thinks it was not JONES: perhaps the poor stupid boy did it on the same principle on which the low-lived wretch acted, who burned the Temple of Diana at Ephesus.</NOTE>. They lived to see the eldest
a Bishop some years before their death—a Bishop who did
honour to episcopacy, by his learning, his munificence, his
piety, his wonderfully well-judged charities.</P>
<P><PB N="ccccxcix" REF="511"/>
The Sunday after the hard frost set in, the Bishop ap∣peared
at breakfast with his <HI>Cloyne-made</HI> wig. All the Bi∣shop's
<HI>own</HI> cloaths, as well as his liveries, were constantly
made at the <HI>little</HI> village of Cloyne. He permitted his sons
to employ a Cork tailor. The Bishop's wig was without a
grain of powder. On his Lady's expressing her astonish∣ment
at his wonderful appearance, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"We shall
soon have a famine; and I have expressly ordered, that
none of the servants put any powder into their wigs,
neither will I."</Q> The chaplain, secretary, and all, took
the hint. A certain Bishop, as soon as the tax was laid,
took out a licence for three men, and his Lady's maid.
Bishop Berkeley, during the frost and scarcity, gave, every
Monday morning, twenty guineas to the poor.</P>
<P>Primate Boulter gave to the poor that winter ten thousand
pounds. The then Lord Bishop of Cork, (Dr. Peter
Brown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whoever has not redde Bishop Peter Brown's Sermons, those which de∣scribe our frail, <HI>no longer frail</HI> bodies when clad with glory, has much pleasure to come.</NOTE>, uncle to the late agreeable Archbishop of Tuam,
and great uncle to the Editor's <HI>young—old</HI> friend Jemmet
Brown, of Riverstown in the county of Cork, who fre∣quently
spent his holydays when at Westminster at Dr.
Berkeley's,) a single man, gave thirty pounds every week.
One day the mayor, his almoner, came, when, the mo∣ney
being all gone, the good Prelate gave all his plate.</P>
<P><PB N="d" REF="512"/>
The Bishop of Cork was great uncle to the Reverend
James Brown of Rivers Town, the present possessor of the
fine ring, the only jewel which his truly honourable grand∣sire
would accept from the Spanish lady, after Colonel
Brown had said,
<Q><L>"Cease, fair lady, cease this strife;</L>
<L>"I have in England a fair lady wife.</L>
<L>"I would not falsify my vow for gold or gain;</L>
<L>"No, not for <HI>all</HI> the fairest dames in Spain."</L></Q></P>
<P>To be sure, Colonel Brown had some <HI>odd</HI> ideas, perhaps
from his grandmother, from which most of our modern
heroes are <HI>entirely</HI> free. As to the generality of our fair
dames of these days, if they chance to meet with a humour∣some
or unkind husband<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parents are <HI>wretches</HI> who marry poor girls of sixteen or seventeen to ani∣mals, to Hodmadods, because they are rich. The Editor had formerly two friends thus sacrificed at sixteen; one had thirty-five thousand pounds, the other had seventy thousand pounds. Neither, had they been permitted to re∣main single until twenty-two, would have taken their husbands for <HI>under</HI>-foot∣men. The six thousand pounds <HI>per annum</HI> was, alas! still is, a noisy mischie∣vous Baboon. The other, a poor, quiet, stupid rake, who several times en∣dangered, in fact ruined, his lady's health—but peace to his manes—he died a penitent, and left his relict immense riches, all he had. The other lives, <HI>per∣haps</HI> to get the <HI>silken</HI> halter, which the Editor's sister, Mrs. Frinsham promised a lady, who said, <Q REND="inline">"that she thought he deserved EVERY thing <HI>but</HI> an halter."</Q> Mrs. Frinsham, in her wonted way, said, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes, hang him, you may give him a <HI>silk</HI> halter, if you please."</Q> Both these very sensible, highly cul∣tivated ladies made most excellent wives; one, alas! still does—almost too good; for she suffers this wretch to force her to request her excellent, worthy, eldest son to enable the father to beggar, by degrees, himself. A woman <HI>owes</HI> a duty to her children, as well as to her husband.</NOTE>, they fly to an Officer of the
<PB N="cli" REF="513"/>
Guards, instead of to some old reverend Divine, for counsel
and consolation, as our great-grandmothers were wont to
do; for, to suppose that there were <HI>no</HI> unpleasant husbands
in the last century, would be to suppose that miracles had
not <HI>then</HI> ceased; but the beauteous young dames were then
differently educated, and <HI>decently</HI> attired.</P>
<P>A few years ago, Mr. Brown taking his ring off to wash
his fingers after dinner, three ladies hid it from him. For
three days he supposed it lost, and was, as he well might,
exceedingly distressed. They deserved a trip at least
<HI>half way</HI> to Botany Bay for their cruelty; since which he
has never worne it, but keeps the invaluable jewel locked
up, and only shews it to those friends who wish to see so
noble, so honourable a curiosity.</P>
<P>In one of Mr. Berkeley's idle fits, he was wild to go into
the Army, that he might take a <HI>handsome</HI> leave of Greek
and Latin; and, by a noble connexion of his Father's, he
had the offer of a Cornetcy in the Oxford Blues. This, at
the age of fifteen, put him into an extacy; and he used
all his eloquent rhetoric on his Father to obtain his per∣mission;
but, as he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"Happily in those things
<PB N="dii" REF="514"/>
my Father was as steady as my Mother in other respects
where she was concerned."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley used to say to his Son, <Q REND="inline">"If, after you
have left Eton, and spent four years at Oxford, you
wish, as it is <HI>possible</HI> you may, to go into the army, you
shall have my free consent."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley valued an English, <HI>i.e.</HI> not a <HI>foreign</HI> uni∣versity
education, as highly as did the Editor from the age
of fifteen. <HI>Nothing</HI> could have tempted her to marry a
gentleman who had not passed some years either at Oxford,
Cambridge, or Dublin. It certainly infuses something into
the brains even of the most <HI>hair-brained</HI> youths that they
very rarely get elsewhere. Several gentlemen of the
different regiments of cavalry constantly quartered at Can∣terbury
had received that advantage; and Dr. Berkeley,
who sometimes dined at the mess with his military ac∣quaintance,
at his return home used to say, <Q REND="inline">"I wonder all
the young men, when they see the deference paid by
the whole regiment to Captain or Major <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, do not
use their time of absence at the University."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, during his residence in Scotland, accepted a
commission in the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers, raised to
quell some riots in the neighbourhood of that city; which
occasioned a gentleman's asking him, <Q REND="inline">"if he had not some
<PB N="diii" REF="515"/>
thoughts of going into the army."</Q> He replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, Sir,
my Father's wisdom kept me out when I was an idle boy,
and my own will keep me out now that I am a man.
Nothing but his Majesty's erecting his standard will ever
make <HI>me a</HI> military man; in that case, I should feel it
my DUTY to repair to it."</Q></P>
<P>One trait more of Mr. Berkeley's singular temper shall
suffice. Like all other children, he had been early told,
that it was utterly impossible to form a syllable in any
known language without the aid of at least one vowel.
It was Mrs. Berkeley's constant custom to go every night,
before she sat down to supper, to the <HI>rooms</HI> of her chil∣dren
(for she never suffered them to sleep together) to see
if they lay straight, and had closed their eyes before they
went to sleep, as many eyes are injured by sleeping without
this necessary care. One night, on entering Mr. Berkeley's
room, she saw his fine eyes rolling about, and began to
give him a lesson for not going to sleep as soon as he went
to bed, at seven. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I cannot sleep for think∣ing"</Q>—(the misery of too many older persons; it cer∣tainly
occasioned the death of that wonderful genius, the
late agreable, amiable, excellent Mr. Gainsborough, Dis∣senting
Minister at Henley upon Thames, elder brother to
the justly celebrated painter, Mr. Gainsborough of Bath;
but it may be in general avoided by care;) as the Editor
<PB N="div" REF="516"/>
knows by experience, and, when grown up a man, taught
her Son—for which <HI>he blessed her</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Her.</HI>]—The Marquis of Lansdown has complimented the Wise old King, by adorning his lovely first Lady's costly monument in High Wycombe Church with several verses from the Book of Proverbs, not engraved in verses, but as a long sentence, and at the bottom,<Q>"SOLOMON."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley felt much gratitude to the polite Marquis for his very amiable attention, in repeatedly obtaining his Majesty's permission to omit his residence at Canterbury during the years he was attending his Son at St. Andrew's. The Marquis and Dr. Berkeley were at Christ Church at the same time.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"How dared you set to thinking? What are
you thinking on?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why you have often told me, that it was
impossible to form a syllable without a vowel; and there∣fore
I have <HI>long resolved to do it,</HI> and to-night have been
thinking till my head runs round; and I believe I have
tried five hundred words, throwing out the vowels, but
I have not <HI>yet</HI> compassed it."</Q></P>
<P>Before six years old he could spell every word in the English
language without book, and before he had completed his
eighth year knew how to introduce them with propriety
when occasion served, which rendered his language re∣markably
elegant—not all mono- and dis-syllables, as is
often the case with children, insomuch as to make the
learned, accomplished Sir John Temple, of America, say,
<PB N="dv" REF="517"/>
<Q REND="inline">"My nephew, at near sixteen, a pretty good Latin and
Greek scholar, can no more express his sentiments in the
language of this little creature, than I could scale the
skies;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"I shall watch him as he grows up; and
farewell to my sagacity if he does not make a most ex∣traordinary
man indeed."</Q> The worthy Sir John needs
not bid adieu to that trait of his fine strong understanding.
The Editor has not heard of any of her beloved respected
American friends for many years.</P>
<P>Mrs. George Berkeley, being little addicted to going
from home, and Dr. Berkeley's hospitality very great, Mr.
Monck Berkeley, when any of his <HI>ton</HI> friends or acquaint∣ance
were going to the Continent, Margate, Ramsgate,
&amp;c. &amp;c. used to give them a letter of introduction to his
Father, or his Mother, which occasioned the latter to say,
<Q REND="inline">"that she was the <HI>good woman</HI> who kept the sign of the
<HI>Berkeley arms.</HI>"</Q> This so tickled the fancy of Mr. Monck
Berkeley, that the next time he visited at home, he brought
a print of Lord Berkeley's arms, framed and glazed.</P>
<P>The next day Mrs. Berkeley, passing through the hall,
seeing something that she had not been accustomed to see,
called to Mr. Wrightson to know what it was. He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"that Mr. Berkeley had ordered his man to hang it up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This worthy man, from his first coming into the family, a lad, before Mr. Monck Berkeley's birth, was an excellent hand in assisting Dr. Berkeley's young friends from Oxford, and his relations from Ireland, together with the ladies of the family, in a joke to enliven Dr. Berkeley when out of spirits. (He continued it for his beloved Mr. Monck Berkeley.) One of which jokes was a ring at the front gate, just as it was dusk, to make Dr. Berkeley believe that his dear Jem∣my Hamilton was arrived, as Mr. Hamilton never fixed the day. This worthy domestic showed his good judgement at fourteen. One of the maids saying to him, <Q REND="inline">"If I was you—I would not help to make a FOOL of my Master so often."</Q> To which, as the Editor's servant told her, Mr. Wrightson sensibly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Indeed I shall. Don't you think that my Mistress, the ladies, and the young gentlemen, know what liberties they may take with my Master better than you or I do: besides, my Master was never once angry with me for it in his life; only says, <HI>Jack you are are a sad rogue.</HI>"</Q></NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dvi" REF="518"/>
Mrs. Berkeley, having recourse to her glass, soon disco∣vered
her Son's <HI>fun;</HI> and, on seeing him, told him, <Q REND="inline">"that
his Father's <HI>ten crosses</HI> had no right to supporters, except

<P>Mr. Berkeley conjured his Mother to let it hang up; to
which she consented, on condition of its being removed
from the hall into the anti-room leading to the eating-room
in the Oaks.</P>
<P>The arms still hang up—and if any of the Editor's old
friends, Scotch or English, should wish to breathe a little

of the soft air of Chertsey, and happen to recollect that she
lives at that beautiful town, and call, she cannot, with truth,
say, that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Here is good entertainment for man and horse;</HI>"</Q>
but she can, and does say, that there is hearty welcome
to—if they are <HI>in</HI> luck—a slice of leg of mutton—if <HI>out</HI>
of luck—hashed mutton and a tart;—and, whilst the Editor's

the uncommonly sensible, clever Mrs. Daniel, mother of
the Messrs. Daniel, who have lately published some fine
things, which the Editor cannot afford to purchase, and

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most dutiful, affectionate son, and obedient
servant, GEORGE-MONCK BERKELEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>It may perhaps be asked, how became Mr. Berkeley
so well acquainted, so interested, for this lovely unfortu∣nate
Princess? His noble friends at Blenheim did him the
honour to invite Mr. Berkeley, during her Highness's visit
at their delightful abode. Mr. Berkeley escorted her to
Nuneham, and waited on her whilst she viewed all the
noble buildings, paintings, &amp;c. at Oxford. She said she
much wished to see Cambridge; but that, if she went, she
feared she should not find <HI>a</HI> Mr. Berkeley there.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted amiablility and alertness,
told her Highness, that <Q REND="inline">"if she wished to go thither, he
would, with great pleasure, give her a letter of intro∣duction
to the Vice-chancellor, who was a very intimate
friend of his Father, and with whom <HI>he</HI> had the happi∣ness
to be well acquainted, the very learned, accom∣plished,
polite Dr. Farmer, Master of Emanuel Col∣lege."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxi" REF="525"/>
He accordingly did so. She said, <Q REND="inline">"She wished to see
every thing that was curious during her stay in England;"</Q>
adding, <Q REND="inline">"I hear that there is a curious Cathedral at Can∣terbury.
I saw nothing but a very old city, and a vast
multitude of people."</Q></P>
<P>Asking Mr. Berkeley, as he seemed to have a large ac∣quaintance,
<Q REND="inline">"if he happened to know any one at Canter∣bury,
to whom he could be so good as to give her a let∣ter
of introduction—just to shew her what was worthy
attention there?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley told her, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that</HI> he could most certainly do,
for that his Father and Mother resided there, and would
have great pleasure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps Mr. Berkeley, in this instance, resembled SPONSORS at the FONT (who promise <HI>a great deal</HI> indeed, which the Editor <HI>never</HI> would, <HI>never</HI> will do, whilst she retains her poor faculties,) promising what <HI>pleasure</HI> his <HI>Mother</HI> would have.—The pleasure would have been, by rebound, gratifying her lovely Son. <HI>Entertaining</HI> Princesses is <HI>too mighty</HI> a task for a poor quiet country gentlewoman. Indeed Mr. Berkeley only said, she would receive every <HI>attention.</HI> That her High∣ness certainly and probably would have accepted <HI>more</HI> graciously than did an English <HI>titled dame</HI> of Mr. Berkeley's <HI>inflicting,</HI> who talked during the time of dinner, as <HI>ton</HI> dames frequently do.—But, on the drawing-room filling with ladies and gentlemen in the afternoon, every way <HI>her</HI> superior <HI>save</HI> in birth, never opened her mouth but to Dr. Berkeley and the Editor; which occasioned Mrs. Berkeley's asking her Son, when he came to the Oaks, <Q REND="inline">"if <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was not a very stupied woman."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No my dear Mother, but she despised <HI>your</HI> visitors."</Q> She can talk at a fine rout in town, I promise you. The Editor for∣bears setting down <HI>her</HI> answer. Dr. Young shall now speak,<Q>—"How will ye weather an ETERNAL night?"</Q></NOTE>,"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="dxii" REF="526"/>
On hearing this, her Highness exulted, expecting, probably,
to find as good a show-man in the Father as she had found in
the Son. Dr. Berkeley could most elegantly, most highly,
entertain his friends in almost every <HI>other</HI> way; but, as a
show-man, he was so notoriously bad, that a gentleman, a
very near relation of his, used to say, <Q REND="inline">"George is the idlest
dog upon earth. One may come from Ireland, stay a
month at Cookham, live on the fat of the land, and, but
for Mrs. George Berkeley, go back again without seeing
even either Cliefden's 'proud alcove,' or Windsor Castle,
to say nothing of half a score other beautiful places
within a drive of his house, to which, with much ado,
Mrs. Berkeley drags him, as she will not leave him to
dine at home without her."</Q> The Editor laid it down as
a rule when she married, and she strictly adhered to it,
never to go any where in a morning, that would not admit
of her placing herself at table at three o'clock, unless Dr.
Berkeley ordered dinner later.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley was famous, when at Oxford, for <HI>not</HI> going
on parties; so as to occasion Mr. James Hamilton afore∣named
to say, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley had always <HI>one</HI> answer at Oxford.
'Oh! not <HI>I</HI> indeed; <HI>I</HI> have seen Blenheim.'—So now it
is, '<HI>I</HI> have seen Windsor Castle,"</Q> &amp;c. The fact is, Dr.
<PB N="dxiii" REF="527"/>
Berkeley, on his arrival at Oxford, the first long vacation,
flew half over England; added to which, any bodily exer∣cise
brought on with him, as with his Father, who used no
exercise at all, but in the easiest hung coach, for many
years, a constant hectic feverishness.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley did not at all resemble a late worthy Fel∣low
of All Souls College. The Editor one day, many
years ago, asking a very witty Fellow of that College, if he
was acquainted with Dr. B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r of his College; he replied
in the affirmative, adding, <Q REND="inline">"he is a very worthy man, but
never <HI>throughly</HI> happy when he has not some <HI>Prince</HI> of
the GERMANIC BODY to <HI>escort</HI> about the University."</Q></P>
<P>The Princess de Lambelle, although she did not see, was
seen at Canterbury. The day after her passing through
Canterbury from Dover, the Editor met her old, <HI>very highly</HI>
respected friend Captain Gostling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor, the <HI>last</HI> time that she visited Canterbury, enquiring after her old friend, of his wonderfully witty sister Mrs. H. Gostling, who could <HI>banish</HI> solitude from a <HI>desart,</HI> whether she was to ask after him as <HI>Major</HI> or <HI>Colonel,</HI> re∣plied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! dear, Madam, <HI>neither;</HI> he prides himself (no great honour to others) on being the <HI>oldest Captain</HI> in the service. Had the old excellent Duke of Montague, who got for him his ensigncy at thirteen, been living, he had not now "whereof to glory" thus."</Q></NOTE>, who reproached her for
not having stepped down to the city to look at the Princess
de Lambelle, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I think <HI>every body</HI> but yourself was
<PB N="dxiv" REF="528"/>
there."</Q> To which the Editor replied, <Q REND="inline">"that she was too
old and too stupid to go to SEE any body;"</Q> (she did not
add <Q REND="inline">"<HI>hear</HI> any thing;"</Q> for she would, if she could afford
to hire horses, willingly drive twenty miles, at least once
every week, to listen to the conversation of Mr. BURKE;)
adding, <Q REND="inline">"I dare say, the wise folks were all disappointed."</Q>
To which Captain Gostling replied, <Q REND="inline">"I was not; for, I
think, in my conscience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think in my conscience the Editor does verily believe that her old friend Captain Gostling has a conscience as <Q REND="inline">"<HI>void of offence towards</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> MAN"</Q> as most men have ever enjoyed, and so his soldiers think.</NOTE>, that she is altogether the very
finest <HI>woman</HI> that the Almighty ever formed."</Q> The Edi∣tor
begged, as she always does, to except her <HI>lamentably
curious</HI> grandmother EVE before the Fall. Why would the
silly woman<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The witty and (as the Editor has heard her Mother say) worthy Bishop Hick∣man, in one of his Sermons, says, that the <HI>sad dialogue</HI> between the <HI>Lady</HI> and the Ser∣pent (ladies <HI>should not be familiar</HI> with the Serpent, however beautiful their <HI>out∣wara</HI> appearance may be) has the following sentence, <Q REND="inline">"Eve, in conversing with the Devil, adds to God's command of not tasting the forbidden fruit one of not touching it; she broke her own command, and found no inconvenience; she then ventured to break God's, and so brought misery on all her descen∣dants, &amp;c."</Q> The Editor, as Atheist Gibbon says, <Q REND="inline">"quotes this from me∣mory not having redde it since she was sixteen years old; but she frequently finds occasion to quote it to those of her acquaintance who seem to wish to be MORE RIGHTEOUS than GOD."</Q> The Editor writes it with due veneration; but there were always Pharisees.</NOTE> wish to know evil? As much good as you
please, Sir Serpent, but NO evil for me.</P>
<P><PB N="dxv" REF="529"/>
A gentleman, very many years ago, mentioned to the
Editor, that he had been taught by a very learned anatomi∣cal
gentleman a method of separating the soul from the
body, without a possibility of being suspected of suicide;
adding, that he would tell it to her: she begged to be ex∣cused
hearing it, lest, at any time of deep affliction, the
enemy of her soul might tempt her to practise it. She also
conjured him to let it die with him, as <HI>angelic</HI> BOYLE did his
secret of discharging ink. The Editor believes her friend
took her advice, as he is dead, and she has never heard any
thing of this <HI>dangerous</HI> secret.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, in one of his letters to his Mother,
speaking of her after much eulogium, adds, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid
I am <HI>really</HI> in love with her without knowing it."</Q></P>
<P>Some pains were taken to conceal from Mr. Berkeley,
just then within a few days of his death, the dreadful fate
of this lady, and of poor Louis the Sixteenth; but in
vain. It was said, <Q REND="inline">"that the monster who murdered this lady
received the wages of his iniquity in England, at the
banking-house of an old amiable friend of Mr. Monck
Berkeley, Mr. Chambers in Bond Street, one poor hun∣dred
pounds only."</Q> Our Blessed Master says, <Q REND="inline">"What
shall it profit a man, if he gain the <HI>whole</HI> world, and lose
his own soul?"</Q> But few Papists are permitted to read
the Book of God.</P>
<P><PB N="dxvi" REF="530"/>
This brings to the Editor's remembrance a dialogue that
many years ago passed between the late King George the
Second and the French Ambassador at Herenhausen, one
day at dinner, when a relation of the Editor, the late Ri∣chard
Powney, Esquire, Fellow of All Souls College, had
the honour to dine with his Majesty, who, when abroad,
laid aside royalty, and wished his guests to forget that he
was a King.</P>
<P>The Ambassador, a lively man, said, <Q REND="inline">"YOU poor Kings ne∣ver
made so <HI>pitiful</HI> figures as when Joshua had <HI>seven</HI> of you
shut up in a cave together."</Q></P>
<P>The King replied, <Q REND="inline">"Ah! you Papists do not read the
Bible, or you would know that he had but <HI>five</HI> of us in
the cave."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Powney, who entertained a table full of company at
Dr. Berkeley's with this anecdote, said, <Q REND="inline">"Every one ad∣mired
the ready wit of the King;"</Q> and all the company
laughed heartily.</P>
<P>This lovely—must one style her unhappy or happy?—Princess
could not avail herself of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
politeness.</P>
<P>An order arriving in England from the unfortunate Louis
XVI. for all his subjects to return to France, an express
<PB N="dxvii" REF="531"/>
followed the Princess to Cambridge. The Editor thinks
she recollects hearing her Son say that she had been there
some days.</P>
<P>This order was so urgent, that the Princess only stayed in
Canterbury to change horses for Dover, at three in the
morning. At eight Mr. Monck Berkeley's letter, men∣tioned
above as to be received from the fair hands of the
beauteous Princess, was brought to the Oaks by the honest
hostler of the Lyon, and delivered with <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mrs. Lambelle's</HI> best
compliments to Mrs. Berkeley, and she was very sorry she
could not visit her as it was so early, but that she should
be in Canterbury again very soon, when she would come—and
that Mr. Berkeley, the gentleman who wrote the letter,
which Mrs. Lambelle charged him to deliver safe, was
very well."</Q></P>
<P>The Princess's degradation by the honest hostler afforded
much diversion to Dr. and Mrs. Berkeley and their friends.
Alas! what degradation did her lovely, lifeless from suffer
after it was lifeless? for, it is very certain she <Q REND="inline">"never <HI>saw,</HI>"</Q>
although she tasted, as every mortal must, death; for her
sweet spirit was dismissed from the lovely casket in a single
instant. Happy if found washed clean in the atoning blood
of God, cloathed with the robes of HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS,
and her spirit renewed by <HI>that</HI> Spirit which HE died to
purchase for all that throughly turn to HIM! See the viiith
<PB N="dxviii" REF="532"/>
chapter to the Romans; which glorious chapter, the Editor
has heard Dr. Berkeley say, his great-grandfather, Mr.
Monck of Grange-Gormond, when old, and visited at times,
perhaps not <HI>very</HI> often, by his fine young lady and gentle∣men
grandchildren, used, his large Bible always lying on
the table, to request them to read to him, which occasioned
<HI>their</HI> supposing that the old gentleman <HI>doated.</HI></P>
<P>The late very pious Dr. Booth, Dean of Windsor, was
so addicted to talk on the same <HI>delightful</HI> subject, that the
Editor well remembers a gentleman coming in one evening
to her house, when she resided at Windsor thirty-six years
ago, and, happening to say <Q REND="inline">"he came from the Deanry,"</Q>
a gentleman asked, <Q REND="inline">"Did you hear any news?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Trevanion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The worthy uncle of the present Member of Parliament for Dover.</NOTE>.—<Q REND="inline">"No."</Q></P>
<P>Gentleman.—<Q REND="inline">"What did you talk about?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Trevanion.—<Q REND="inline">"Why on the Dean's beloved topic, the
great blessing of REDEMPTION, the wonders of RE∣DEEMING
LOVE. Aye, aye, good man; he never seems
to enjoy any other conversation."</Q> How happy in <HI>age</HI> to
resemble the <HI>friends</HI> of St. Paul! <Q REND="inline">"whose conversation,"</Q> the
Apostle tells us, <Q REND="inline">"is in Heaven,"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. May that of
the Editor, and all her beloved <HI>aged</HI> friends, be daily more
and more so, is her <HI>ardent wish.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="dxix" REF="533"/>
When last at Canterbury, the Editor requested her wor∣thy
friend, the throughly elegant amiable Mrs. Hughes, to
say to her relation, the Reverend Mr. Hambley, the pre∣sent
vicar of Cookham, how very sensibly dear Dr. Berke∣ley
and herself felt that universally beloved gentleman's po∣lite,
generous, pleasant conduct, on Dr. Berkeley resigning
that lovely spot. Lest it should have slipped that lady's me∣mory,
the Editor inserts part of a letter of hers to Dr.
Berkeley, who, as well as her Son, preserved all her scrawls:
<Q REND="inline">"You bade me draw the character of your successor (at
Cookham). You observed that he had LYONS in his bearing
armorial: to <HI>that</HI> they are confined, I really believe. He
seems to have much of the Lamb in his nature and man∣ners,
and I do not suspect that he is a wolf in sheep's
cloathing; which I abhor. Suppose we get our worthy
friend Sir Isaac to exchange the noble Savage for the
lovely Lamb for him?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley gladly embraces this
opportunity of holding up to its merited praise so amiable
a character.</P>
<P>It may be asked, <Q REND="inline">"What could <HI>Mrs.</HI> Berkeley have to
do with dilapidations during the life of Dr. Berkeley?"</Q>
She has, alas! had <HI>too</HI> much to do with them since his
lamented death. Dr. Berkeley never took dilapidations,
but at Acton a very trifle, and at Canterbury not forty
pounds, and immediately expended on the Prebendal House
<PB N="dxx" REF="534"/>
more than two hundred pounds. The Editor asked him how
he came to take any, as he never had before, and Dr. Sted∣man
did not die rich; he sweetly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Because I had
not you here to remind me not to do it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley used always, from the time he married, to
leave all business that he thought might have any thing at
all unpleasant in it to Mrs. Berkeley, laughingly saying.
<Q REND="inline">"it was the pleasantest thing in the world to have a wife,
that one could metamorphose into a steward; that although <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (calling Mrs. Berkeley by her name) had always
declared, when she was single, she was resolved never to
marry <HI>any</HI> man who took a woman merely as a disinterested
housekeeper, to see that the servants did not cheat him
from morning till night, and to bring him an heir; yet
she had not declared against being a steward; as was the
case of the <HI>little quiet</HI> mother of a worthy Baronet, now a
Peer, whose father had <HI>at least</HI> twenty thousand pounds <HI>per
annum.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>One day, an amiable Countess, a lovely friend of the
Editor's youth, dining at the <HI>said</HI> wise man's, with other
company, after the ladies were retired to the drawing-room,
the butler came, whispered the lady; after some time he re∣peated
his visit, and, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! beware of the third time,"</Q> says
the old proverb, he entered, and whispered loud enough
for every one to hear, <Q REND="inline">"Madam, if you do not please to
<PB N="dxxi" REF="535"/>
come, and <HI>weigh</HI> out the hops, they cannot go on with
the brewing, and the beer will be all spoiled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor's Father was famous for having the finest strong beer in Berk∣shire, and she was resolved her husband should be as famous. She <HI>routed out all</HI> his brewery books; Mr. Wrightson <HI>studied</HI> them, as Berks and Canterbury can testify, to excellent effect.</NOTE>".</Q></P>
<P>Beer is generally spoiled <HI>by</HI> hops; and the Editor has
been repeatedly told, that there is still an act of Queen
Elizabeth <HI>unrepealed,</HI> forbidding the <Q REND="inline">"planting or culti∣vating
that <HI>pernicious weed</HI> called hop."</Q> (The Editor has
heard from her youth that the law for extinguishing fire on
the tolling the curfew bell is also unrepealed—She is some∣times
<HI>tempted</HI> to wish it was enforced.) Perhaps there are
few persons who fully know the wholesomeness of aged
hard beer. The Editor has frequently heard the late ex∣cellent
Mrs. Tucker, of Canterbury, say, that when her
father was head master of the King's School, the second
masters, and the other boarding houses, had, summer after
summer, a very bad fever amongst the boys; but her father,
Mr. Gurney, had not a boy ill, which <HI>he</HI> attributed en∣tirely,
under God, to their drinking very hard <HI>home-brewed</HI>
beer. He brewed, as they do in all <HI>wise</HI> gentlemen's fami∣lies,
only twice in the year, in March and October. All
the world have of late found out the virtues of beer without
hops. New, or as it is commonly called sweet-wort, is ex∣cellent
<PB N="dxxii" REF="536"/>
for worms in children, and for scurvies in men;
and when the poison of the strong rank weed, hop, is gone
off, it is <HI>aqua vitae</HI> to many, to the Editor, even when al∣most
vinegar; but a table spoonful of stale brewer's beer is
almost death to her. <HI>Qu.</HI> Why is this?</P>
<P>The lady, however, begged excuse, went, and did her
<HI>duty as housekeeper.</HI> Her husband built a very fine house,
but would have no back door, that <HI>he</HI> might see the mo∣tions
of his half hundred of servants all day long. The
Editor, then about seventeen, offered to lay a wager with
a gentleman, that within two years he would break out a
back door; he did it within one.</P>
<P>The Editor now experiences the want of a back <HI>gate</HI> at
least. She has few servants, but, thank God, they are
not eye servants, so want not watching, but there are many
beggars who do; for <Q REND="inline">"these beasts of the <HI>people,</HI>"</Q> on
being constantly refused relief, leave the front, the only
gate, open, for the beasts of the <HI>common,</HI> to rout the
garden direfully indeed.</P>
<P>The Editor, and a lady with her, went a few weeks ago
into a shop: a girl, about thirteen, shabbily dressed, came
in, asked for a pennyworth of gingerbread; it was cut;
and also for a pennyworth of sugar candy; the mistress of
the shop sensibly asked, <Q REND="inline">"Would you have both?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxxiii" REF="537"/>Beggar.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Yes, I eats um together.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This being at the time when bread was at its very highest
price, and WISE people believed we had no corn in the na∣tion;
the Editor asked, <Q REND="inline">"If she lived at D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, that
she might <HI>avoid</HI> relieving <HI>her</HI> family?"</Q></P>
<P>Beggar.—<Q REND="inline">"No."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Where then?"</Q></P>
<P>Beggar.—<Q REND="inline">"No where; we travels the country."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"What do you sell, laces and pins?"</Q></P>
<P>Beggar.—<Q REND="inline">"No, we only travels about."</Q>—That is, we are
common beggars; can it be charity to relieve such?</P>
<P>The Editor, at length getting sight of most of the sheets
at once, is confirmed in what she suspected; that she has
been guilty of tautology, of Egotism, or rather <HI>Editorism.</HI>
It is said of the excellent Lord Chancellor Clarendon, that,
in his incomparable History of the Rebellion, the <HI>Chancel∣lor
of the Exchequer</HI> is <HI>too</HI> often introduced.</P>
<P>The Editor has always thought that there is at <HI>least</HI> as
much, if not more, in the circumlocution often practised,
and she is certain a vast deal of affectation, which she ever
<PB N="dxxiv" REF="538"/>
abhorred, does still abhor, especially in matrons, and pities
in girls, in persons relating transactions, in which they
were <HI>necessarily</HI> principal actors, front figures, who cannot
be thrown into the <HI>back-ground</HI> without ruining the picture,
as is done by <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, by using circumlocution
in mentioning themselves. It is like a very plain woman
<HI>decking</HI> herself <HI>violently;</HI> it <HI>calls attention,</HI> but does not,
according to the Editor's humble opinion, in <HI>either</HI> case,
<HI>create respect.</HI> It must be considered that through life there
was so constant an intercourse, whether present or absent,
between Mr. Berkeley and his Mother, that She has, during
the writing these sheets, frequently studied how to put her∣self
in a dark corner, which has been much more difficult
than the doing that kind office to her dear Son, until he
attained to the age of five, when <HI>that</HI> mode of punishment
ceased, and another somewhat similar was substituted.</P>
<P>The Editor, perhaps, (having described herself as the <HI>most
resolute of all females,</HI> where her children or her conscience
were concerned,) owes it to herself to say, that it is
most certain that she is not cursed with a <HI>stubborn</HI> or a <HI>saucy</HI>
spirit: both were pretty easily by her wise mother nipped
almost <HI>before</HI> they were <HI>in bud.</HI> When she was not quite
four years old, being very busily employed in underssing
her doll, to put it into the cradle, in an arbore at the far∣thest
part of a very long walk, her mother called her: thus
<HI>importantly</HI> occupied, she, conceiving that it could not be
<PB N="dxxv" REF="539"/>
heard, uttered the following soliloquy, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I won't come till I
have done.</HI>"</Q> Very soon appeared the amiable woman who
had taken care of here from a month old, (for, thank God,
her mother was her nurse,) with <Q REND="inline">"Oh! <HI>fie,</HI> Miss, how came
you to say such a naughty word to my Mistress?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"What
word?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why you know, Miss, you said <HI>I won't
come.</HI>"</Q> Miss did <HI>not</HI> deny it, knowing, from the time she
could articulate, that a LIE, even with her father, was a
threat of being whipped, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>all</HI> but to death."</Q></P>
<P>The little culprit was delivered to her mother, standing at
the garden door to receive her. She can almost fancy that
her wrist, when she thinks of it, feels the grasp of her mo∣ther's
elegant long fingers, and hears her say, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>You won't
come,</HI> MADAM, will you?"</Q> In she was taken, shewn a nice
slice of bread covered with currant jelly on the table.
<Q REND="inline">"Look you there, I called you to give you that for your
supper. You will now go to bed without any supper,
but a good whipping;"</Q> which was instantly administered,
to teach her never to say <Q REND="inline">"I won't"</Q> again to her mother or
father. It proved effectual; for, the Editor can, with
strictest truth, assert, that this was the <HI>first</HI> and the <HI>last</HI> time
that <HI>frightful</HI> word was ever pronounced by her, to either
parent.</P>
<P>It pleased the gracious Giver of every good gift to spare
that excellent mother until her daughter was twenty years
<PB N="dxxvi" REF="540"/>
old, although at the time of her father's death no one
would have given half a year's purchase for her life; and she
has frequently told her daughters, when grown up, that
every breaking up, when she returned them to Mrs.
Sheeles's, that she conceived she had taken her <HI>last</HI> leave of
them. The Editor often cannot refrain exclaiming, to her
excellent sister, <Q REND="inline">"How gracious was God to us in sparing
our angelic Mother!"</Q></P>
<P>To shew that the Editor needed not much discipline to
bring her to submit to <HI>lawful</HI> authority, a simple little story
may, she hopes, be excused. The <HI>fault</HI> is obliterated from
her memory; the <HI>punishment</HI> never can, and her consequent
sufferings. One of the Fathers, describing woman, says,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>She is an animal delighting in finery.</HI>"</Q> A very pretty pale
blue (the Editor's favourite colour, from her cradle, for her∣self,
to this time) bonnet had just arrived with some things
of her mother's from town; which she had contrived to get
sight of half a dozen times during the morning, and was
told she was to wear it in the afternoon to go visit Miss
Sloper, sister of General Sir Robert Sloper; Mr. and Mrs. Slo∣per
then lived at Waltham Place. (This young lady died at
Mrs. Dennis's school.) Whether elated by so frequently
contemplating the <HI>beautiful</HI> bonnet, or in what else she of∣fended,
whether by flying up one pair of stairs and down
the other of the old house, a favourite amusement with both
sisters when their <HI>Mother</HI> was out of the house. Be this,
<PB N="dxxvii" REF="541"/>
however, as it may, the culprit was called, well-jobed, and
told, that instead of going out visiting in the new bonnet,
she was to stay at home tied by the arm to, she believes, the
first fly-table ever made in England, made according to Mrs.
Frinsham's own directions given to a country cabinet-maker,
and which she (the culprit) could have drawn all over
the house. She supplicated for pardon, but in vain;
she was made to sit down on the floor under the table,
tied by the left arm. She was tied with a good long nee∣dleful
of common white silk, taken from a ball in her
mother's Indian work-bowl. She wept much a little while,
but, being naturally of a very cheerful disposition, soon
dried her eyes, and began to amuse herself with scratching
a tree and some flowers on the shining old oak floor, with
a large pin that she had coaxed out of her frock behind.</P>
<P>The Editor's delight in drawing and mixing colours com∣menced,
she remembers, before she left off her back∣string.
Thus amused, she <HI>forgot</HI> that she was a prisoner,
and had crawled quite to the stretch of her tether. On
finding it, she was in such terror lest the silk should break,
and that her mother should think that she had dared to li∣berate
herself, that she crept so close to the leg of the table
as to let the silk hang in a loop for considerably more than
an hour, not amusing herself in any way but the delight
arising from her happiness that the silk had <HI>not</HI> broke.</P>
<P><PB N="dxxviii" REF="542"/>
It may perhaps, by some, be thought strange, that a <HI>very</HI>
docile girl should make so very resolute a mother. Her
disposition is naturally yielding, except when duty called
for steadiness, as in the case of Mr. Berkeley. His brother
was as easily governed as his Mother.</P>
<P>The Editor had the happiness, she still feels it such, that
her mother bore testimony to the amenableness of her
temper a very few months before her <Q REND="inline">"slow sudden death."</Q>
A beloved friend of the Editor was strenuously asserting,
<Q REND="inline">"that every human being was <HI>stubborn,</HI> and would, if <HI>possible,</HI>
get their own will; that nothing but superior absolute
force prevented it;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"shew me any man,
woman, or child, that is <HI>not</HI> stubborn, and I will shew
you a <HI>black swan.</HI>"</Q> Some late travellers have discovered
this <HI>rara avis.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor constantly opposed the doctrine of <HI>universal
stubbornness,</HI> and insisted, that, although she had MANY
faults, she was certainly not a <HI>wilful</HI> being; and respectfully
requested her mother to say whether she thought <HI>her</HI> so.
Mrs. Frinsham laid down her work, and, lifting up her
sweet eyes, which exactly resembled Dr. Berkeley's, said,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh! no, my dear, indeed you <HI>are not</HI> stubborn; you
never gave me five minutes trouble in your life from
<HI>wilfulness.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxxix" REF="543"/>
The mentioning of these things brings to the Editor's
recollection a conversation with her Son not many months
before his death, telling a friend, who had a violent-tem∣pered
little boy, <Q REND="inline">"that she should contrive to prevent his
crying and screaming so violently as described, as it was
dangerous, and often productive of bad consequences to
<HI>boys'</HI> health;"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"that she always took care to pre∣vent
it with her own boys; that when she had locked
them into a light room, (no child should ever be shut
into a dark room; sad consequences have arisen from it;)
and got the key in her own pocket, that no servant might
<HI>kindly</HI> administer consolation, she always stood to listen till
the roaring ceased."</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, did
you, <HI>could</HI> you think that I was fool enough to scream a
moment longer than I thought you were in hearing?
I strained my lungs that you might hear as long as I
conceived it possible you should hear." (Mrs. Berkeley
had often observed that the last shout was the most violent.)
"I then immediately reached down some book, (the prison
was generally the Editor's book closet,) to amuse me till
the hour, or the two hours, according to my sentence,
was elapsed, <HI>I</HI> never shed a tear;"</Q> (<HI>that</HI> his Father often
remarked;) <Q REND="inline">"I only <HI>roared like a wild bull,</HI> to, as I con∣ceived,
<HI>punish you</HI> for punishing me—blessing on you for
your wisdom!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxxx" REF="544"/>
The Editor, on perusing the sheets quite ready for pub∣lication,
finds that she has omitted many anecdotes that
must have heightened the ideas of Mr. Monck Berkeley's
wisdom and amiability, and his undaunted courage. His
rescuing a poor little child late one night near Covent Gar∣den,
as he was going home to his chambers. He met the
thief soon after at the Old Bailey, and she was transported.
His rescuing an amiable friend of his from the <HI>Jews,</HI> whose
<HI>wise</HI> guardians did not, at twenty, allow him as many hun∣dreds
<HI>per annum</HI> as, the next year, he was to inherit thou∣sands;
and, assisted by his learned, amiable friend, Mr.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, from the Gentiles at four in the morning, when
going along Covent Garden they saw a coach, and some
kind of bustle and struggle.</P>
<P>Hereupon Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"It is very late, let us go
and see if all is right there."</Q></P>
<P>On drawing near, they saw a gentleman lifting—drag∣ging
into a coach by three females, assisted by the coach∣man.
Mr. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Good God! Berkeley,
it is your friend <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley sprung forward, and said, <Q REND="inline">"My <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>,

<P><GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, extremely intoxicated, replied, <Q REND="inline">"I do not

<P><PB N="dxxxi" REF="545"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you do; you are going with us."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.'s Friend.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, yes."</Q></P>
<P>The Nymphs began raving, and said, <Q REND="inline">"The gentlemen
had no right to take their <HI>guest</HI> from them. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was
going to spend the <HI>evening</HI> with them."</Q></P>
<P>The Coachman said, <Q REND="inline">"The gentleman <HI>belonged</HI> to the
ladies. They had taken his coach to carry him home."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Have-a-care, my friend, I have
taken the number of your coach already; and if you act
like a villain, as surely as I live till morning, <HI>you</HI> shall
appear before the Lord-Mayor. I fancy the ladies can
walk home by themselves; and do you assist us in putting
<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> into the coach; and at your peril drive
to any place but where I order you."</Q></P>
<P>They accordingly drove to <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>'s lodgings,
where they delivered him, his <HI>bourse bien chargée,</HI> not <HI>des louis,</HI>
but guineas, and his very fine watch, safe into the
hands of his <HI>valet de chambre,</HI> with directions to put him
to bed.</P>
<P>The Editor rejoices very sincerely, that PROVIDENCE
has some time ago delivered his Lordship into the hands of
a very sensible worthy Lady, who has brought him a son
<PB N="dxxxii" REF="546"/>
and heir to his vast estate. May he grow up as amiable as
his father, as sensible as his mother!</P>
<P>The Editor, on perusing the sheets of this wonderfully
long Preface <HI>de suite tout ensemble</HI> is hurt to find, that her
memory is become so treacherous as to have permitted her
to be so guilty of tautology, at the distance of little more
than six months, to have twice quoted some favourite lines
of Mr. Addison. This, however, may be pardoned, for
they are beautiful, and she repeats the hymn of which they
form a part every day; but repeating her own remarks or
comments she laments, as she does her <HI>seeming</HI> ingratitude,
when, mentioning the amiable hospitality of Scotland, she
perceives she has omitted to mention the very highly polite
attentions received by Dr. Berkeley's family, from the very
elegant sister of the worthy Lord Newark, resident at St.
Andrew's when Dr. Berkeley's family went to reside there;
<Q REND="inline">"although last, yet not least,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>A lady, the other day, said to the Editor, <Q REND="inline">"that our
Nobility wanted a <HI>little</HI> humbling; that to be sure they
had carried the matter <HI>much too far</HI> in France; but a <HI>little</HI>
humbling would do them service for both worlds."</Q> The
Editor begged that the <HI>Scottish</HI> in general, excepting some
few, might be spared; and, as they took the advice of our
blessed Master, and amiably <Q REND="inline">"humbled themselves, that they
and some few English might be exempted from the <HI>said
humbling.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dxxxiii" REF="547"/>
The Editor has not the honour to be known at present
to many Noblesse,
<Q>"<HI>The world forgetting, by the world forgot;</HI>"</Q> but she is apt to think that <HI>modern</HI> Nobility are addicted to
set more value on a coronet than those to whom it has de∣scended
by hereditary succession through several genera∣tions.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley some years ago had the honour to cor∣respond
with some English Nobles of both sexes, now no
more. Very many of their letters are preserved—as polite
as if <HI>she</HI> had been noble.</P>
<P>Several years ago the Editor took leave to write to a
modern Peeress, requesting a very small favour for a young
lady, <HI>very very</HI> much Mrs. Berkeley's superior, not to say by
birth the Peeress's. The answer was returned on an half-sheet
of common paper, sealed with a wafer pricked with a pin,
expressing astonishment that the Editor could suppose she
could do what she requested,—use her interest to procure
a vacant twenty pounds <HI>per annum</HI> for a poor lady, who
must have had the PAS of the Peeress until her Lord was
a few years ago created a Peer. What made it <HI>still stranger</HI>
to the <HI>poor simple</HI> Editor was, that when the Peeress and
herself were both girls, the Peeress's lovely mother felt,
at least expressed herself (she had the grace of humility)
<PB N="dxxxiv" REF="548"/>
obliged by the Editor's mother's attentions to her and her
little girl, now the <HI>little</HI> Peeress. This occured not long
after the Editor's return to England, and she supposed
that some great revolution in politeness had taken place
during her absence, and that poor untitled gentry must
approach Nobility as Swift makes the subjects of Japan
approach their Emperor, and <Q REND="inline">"lick the dust as they crawl
towards him."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor's ideas concerning a revolution in manners
were, however, soon corrected, by her having the honour
to receive letters <HI>à l'égarde de son cher fils</HI> from her amiable
friend, Lord Loughborouh. An instance of his Lordship's
amiability, related to her by another old friend, the agree∣able
Mr. Berridge, the hospitable master of John à Gaunt's
Castle, emboldened her, at the distance of near a quarter
of a century, to write to his Lordship to introduce that
dear young man, telling his Lordship, <Q REND="inline">"that naturalists as∣sure
us, that the most timid animals become courageous
where their young are concerned, that she felt the truth
of the assertion."</Q> His Lordship's, and good Lady Lough∣borough's
attentions are carefully registered in her grateful
memory. His Lordship's answer was most polite and
friendly. Their amiable Graces of Marlborough, and the
late excellent Lady Effingham, who have chanced to
honour the Editor with letters, have written on <HI>whole</HI> sheets
of gilt paper, most condescendingly subscribed, and sealed
<PB N="dxxxv" REF="549"/>
—as to a gentlewoman—not to be mantua-maker. Indeed
the Editor used to write more respectfully to the famous
Mrs. Munday, her old playfellow, niece of John Breedon,
Esquire, of Bear-Court, Berks, when she wanted a new
<HI>négligée.</HI></P>
<P>The poor lady for whom the Editor supplicated the
Peeress's interest, for only a poor vacant twenty pounds <HI>per
annum,</HI> has the honour, at least her grandfather had, and
upwards for <HI>very many</HI> centuries, the honour to have two
crowned heads, put on mourning at their decease, (as,
whilst there was a King in France, was always done by that
King when the head of the Courtney family died,) which
the Editor is <HI>very</HI> sure no crowned head ever did for <HI>her</HI> an∣cestors,
nor, as she verily believes, for those of Captain <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, father of the Peeress. The poor young lady
shewed her high birth, by submitting with, the Editor really
thinks, unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity,
to the distresses to which an imprudent match, in <HI>very</HI>
early youth, had unavoidably subjected herself, her elegant
husband, and lovely little girl. Although Mrs. Berkeley
failed to obtain relief from the <HI>courtly,</HI> COURTEOUS <HI>Peeress,</HI>
the amiable Dr. Berkeley's pocket failed not to alleviate
their <HI>deep</HI> distress; for which the young gentleman blessed
him when dying. His sensible, grateful relict and lovely
daughter continue to bless his sweet memory. Dr. Berke∣ley
<PB N="dxxxvi" REF="550"/>
is receiving his reward; the Peeress <HI>still</HI> enjoys her <HI>new</HI>
coronet.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, a great herald from ten years old,
was consulted at twenty-two by a noble, amiable Peer, a
great herald, a friend of the Peeress's Lord elect, about
supporters to be added when the arms of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> were to
be <HI>tipped</HI> with a coronet. Mentioning the selection Mr.
Monck Berkeley first made would too plainly mark out the
Peeress, who, it is hoped, although she is now turned three∣score,
may live to grow older—and wiser. The Editor ne∣ver
wishes <Q REND="inline">"her pocket cat-o-nine tails"</Q> to <HI>wound</HI> any but
the vicious and the ungrateful, and only to make the <HI>insolent
tingle</HI> a little. The Editor has some letters, which she pre∣serves,
from ancient <HI>noblesse,</HI> male and female, for their in∣ternal
as well as their external merit. The assumed motto
of the excellent Countess of L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, round her Lady∣ships
cipher-seal, is always carefully preserved; <Q REND="inline">"HOLINESS
IS HAPPINESS."</Q> Oh! that this were the <HI>motto</HI> of mil∣lions,
noble and non-noble!</P>
<P>The two following letters of the late George-Monck
Berkeley, Esquire, were written at different periods; the
first, when he was just about to return from his <HI>last</HI> vist to
Scotland in the end of the autumn of 1789, not then, alas!
thinking it was his last visit; for he frequently used to say,
<Q REND="inline">"If God spares my life to settle, I shall every now and
<PB N="dxxxvii" REF="551"/>
then, once in three or four years, in summer vacation,
make a visit to Scotland for a few weeks."</Q> Although an
enthusiastic admirer of Johnson in his writings, all on the
side of virtue, his integrity, &amp;c. he used to say, <Q REND="inline">"He be∣haved
like a savage in Scotland, where every respectful
attention was shewn to him by every one."</Q> Mr. Berke∣ley
constantly styled Dr. Johnson the <HI>noble learned</HI> BEAR.
His own abhorrence of what is called rudeness, even when
persons are ever so much inflamed by resentment, he con∣tracted
very early in life from his Mother, who added to
Shakspeare's <Q REND="inline">"Speak daggers, but use none,"</Q> let those
daggers, for your <HI>own</HI> sake, be <HI>gilded;</HI> never use <HI>coarse</HI> lan∣guage,
nor make a <HI>coarse</HI> simile. The second was written
at Dover a very few months before his lamented death.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE CLERICAL AND LAY MEMBERS OF THE EPISCOPAL COMMUNION IN
SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sirs and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Presuming, that by
this time you are all sufficiently informed with respect to
the steps that have been taken by your Bishops to pro∣cure
<PB N="dxxxviii" REF="552"/>
a repeal of the penal laws, and that you are also
acquainted with the TOTAL failure of their undertakings;
I shall only trespass on your attention whilst I suggest the
propriety of a second application to Parliament, and pro∣pose
to your consideration a plan of proceedure, of which
the expediency will, I doubt not, be sufficiently appa∣rent,
to require little or no assistance from argument.</P>
<P>The plan, for which I wish to procure your sanction,
is as follows: That each of the two orders I have now
the honour to address, should elect a representative to su∣perintend
on its behalf the next application to Parliament,
for a repeal of those laws, which it is no longer the inte∣rest
of any man to enforce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not suffering more than four persons, excepting the family of the Clergy∣man, to assemble at one time to attend the reading of the English Liturgy, un∣der a severe penalty indeed. The Editor has heard a reverend old Divine say, <Q REND="inline">"That he has read it so repeatedly over to <HI>only</HI> four, that frequently by evening he has scarce been able to speak to be heard."</Q> It was <HI>not</HI> a sabbath of <HI>rest</HI> to him, poor man. This is something <HI>like</HI> persecution. The <HI>noble charitable</HI> Lord who framed the Bill <HI>wittily</HI> said, <Q REND="inline">"He had got a bill passed that would starve one half of the Scotch and <HI>d <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n</HI> the other."</Q> Perhaps it did not occur to his Lordship that an English Peer (bred a Presbyterian, as his Lordship was) could invent any thing TOO severe for <HI>Scottish</HI> Episcopalians. To the honour of the Editor's Presbyterian neighbours at St. Andrew's, she never saw the Episcopalians incommoded, although they assembled in much larger numbers at Mr. Lindsey's chapel. The spirit had <HI>quite subsided,</HI> and Lord <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> had been gone some years before to join—either the starved, or the d <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d Scots!</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="dxxxix" REF="553"/>
To direct the attention of the <HI>inferior clergy</HI> to the pre∣servation
of their own rights, as connected with that
church to which their services are devoted, would have
appeared to me wholly unnecessary, had I not witnessed
their supineness on the late occasion.</P>
<P>That the Bishops undertook their embassy without the
concurrence of the Clergy and Laiety over whom they
preside; that they constituted themselves, SOLE AND AB∣SOLUTE
GOVERNORS of the Church IN Scotland; that
they concerted measures for the relief of that Church,
without the advice or approbation of the inferior Clergy,
who, with themselves, were equally interested in the
success of these measures; and, that they have plainly
evinced their utter incapacity to execute their own plans;
are <HI>facts</HI> I need not call to your recollection. But, as a
man <HI>much</HI> interested in the welfare of that Religious So∣ciety
in which he hopes to die; I think it a duty incum∣bent
on me, to suggest to you the necessity of preventing
a second encroachment on your privileges, and of at∣tempting,
in concurrence with our <HI>Prelates,</HI> by a PROPER
and RESPECTFUL application to Parliament, to procure
for that Church, of which you are at once members and
guardians, the protection of Government, whose autho∣rity
it acknowledges, and whose lenity it has long ex∣perienced.</P>
<P><PB N="dxl" REF="554"/>
Do not, Gentlemen, however suppose, that, to lessen
the respect due to the <HI>Episcopal</HI> character, or to circum∣scribe
the authority of the Bishops by improper limits, is
the object proposed by the present Address. Such is by
no means the case. But when any authority, however
venerable, presumes to invade the rights of others, it is
the duty of those whose liberties are endangered, to de∣fend
<HI>that blessing,</HI> for which an <HI>equivalent</HI> has never <HI>yet</HI>
been discovered.</P>
<P>Let me, therefore, Reverend Sirs and Gentlemen,
entreat you, without delay, to elect, each of you, a re∣presentative,
who may attend such Bishops as may be
disposed to go upon a second embassy to London; for, if
you reject this measure, errors, similar to those which
have already disappointed your hopes, may again frustrate
any exertions that may be made in your favour, and you
may <HI>for ever</HI> lose that relief which the present govern∣ment
so readily affords to all its suffering subjects. This
advice will, I fear, lose much weight, as coming from
the pen of an Anonymous Writer; and I should certainly
subscribe my name, were I vain enough to suppose it
could in the least influence those to whom it is ad∣dressed.</P>

Some years ago the Editor was applied to, by the
lawyers of her WORTHY relation, to give information,
when, where, and by whom, his father and mother were
married, it being necessary to prove it before he could be∣come
seised of his grandfather's vast estate in * * * * * * *.
After repeated applications to Dr. Berkeley to <HI>make</HI> the
Editor tell, and her Son's assuring her that, if she did not tell
them, they would summon her into Westminster Hall,
she wrote <HI>a</HI> letter that scared, yet diverted her beloved
Husband and Son, when she shewed it to them before she
sealed it, in which she pathetically laments, <Q REND="inline">"having ne∣ver
heard, or read in History or <HI>Romance,</HI> of but two
Monsters, at whose suit <HI>those who bore them</HI> were im∣prisoned;
that one of them should be <HI>her</HI> kinsman; the

Sterne, the seducer of ELIZA, and the <HI>distractor</HI> of her
husband, the support of eight fine young children;"</Q> as
some worthy wise man related in the Gentleman's Maga∣zine
at that time.</P>
<P>The letter given us by Mr. Walpole, signed, ANNE DOR∣SET,
PEMBROKE AND MONTGOMERIE, is perfect <HI>milk</HI> and
<HI>water,</HI> compared with the Editor's. She preserves the
copy (a rare thing with her to make or take one) in an ele∣gant
box, for the <HI>amazement</HI> of an old friend or two, who
<HI>admire</HI> the <HI>spirit</HI> of the Editor, who trusts that she attends
to the advice of her blessed Master, <Q REND="inline">"Be ye angry, and sin
<PB N="dxlix" REF="563"/>
not."</Q> Does not God say, <Q REND="inline">"Who will rise up with ME
against the wicked, and who will take MY part against the
evil-doers?"</Q> The Editor ever has, and hopes she ever
shall, when she thinks <HI>it</HI> necessary, not in her <HI>own</HI> cause,
but her friends or her neighbours.</P>
<P>Many arguments were used, by Dr. Berkeley. and her
Son, to <HI>blunt</HI> the sentences of this letter, but all in vain;
and Mr. Monck Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, if my Mother
<HI>will not</HI> write another, this will prevent her being called
up to give evidence in person, as it will prove that she
knows that Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was married to the daughter of
Bishop <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>; which is all that is necessary."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor, naturally rather a coward, was once very
near being murdered, at least knocked down, a tremendous
thing to befal a poor little female. One morning in winter,
(the Editor never wastes the <HI>summer</HI> mornings in walking)
returning from her morning walk at Canterbury, passing
through the Cloisters, there issued from the dark chapel,
called St. Mary in Criptis, violent blows—on a nearer ap∣proach,
dreadful groans, On turning to look into it, the
following words were heard, <Q REND="inline">"Because I am old and feeble,
you take this time to abuse me, when all the men are
gone off to dinner."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you old dog, I'll do for you,
I <HI>promise</HI> you."</Q> The Editor, much nimbler than at pre∣sent,
flew in, and there saw a sturdy young villain giving such
<PB N="dl" REF="564"/>
blows as she never saw before, and hopes never to see
again, to a poor, old, silver-haired man. She called out,
<Q REND="inline">"You wretch, leave off: how dare you beat the poor old
man in this shocking manner?"</Q> He instantly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"I'll beat him to death, what business is it of yours? <HI>I'll
teach you to</HI> meddle:"</Q> and, clenching his fist, advanced,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"Who are you? I'll teach you <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Who
am <HI>I? Nobody:</HI> but my Husband is VICE DEAN, and I
will go home, and send him to <HI>trounce</HI> you, for beating
this poor old man, you <HI>vile</HI> wretch, I promise you."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor never felt pleasure before from Dr. Berkeley's
<HI>local</HI> dignities; on this occasion, it made her happy. The
Monste turned as pale as death, flew by her, and was quite
out of sight in an instant. She took the poor old man
home to her house, and desired her careful, compassionate
servants to see to him, and give him some wine, &amp;c. to com∣fort
him.</P>
<P>The Editor feels it incumbent on her to declare, that,
from the age of about seventeen, when she began to consi∣der
seriously, that Time is a point, Eternity A NEVER-END∣ING
circle; that she resolved to endeavour to discharge the
relative duties of life, as she felt she should wish at the
<HI>aweful</HI> hour of death, as a daughter, a sister, a friend, a
mistress, a neighbour, a wife, and a mother.</P>
<P><PB N="dli" REF="565"/>
As a daughter, the extremely tender attachment she
felt for her mother from childhood, added to gratitude
for a very liberal expensive education, rendered the stu∣dying
to obey and delight her a <HI>pleasant</HI> task.</P>
<P>As a sister, Mrs. Berkeley owned much, for the <HI>tenderest</HI>
love; and never had, when a girl, the least idea of acting in
character of <HI>eldest</HI> sister, which she ever reprobated.—The idea
of brothers and sisters being ANGRY at an imprudent match
is to her wonderful; they may be grieved. Had the Edi∣tor's
sister, who <HI>early</HI> in life resolved never to marry any man,
as she told a friend some little time ago, chosen to unite
hereself with a chimney-sweeper; the Editor would have
kept up friendship with her sister, and civility with the
<HI>quondam</HI> SWEEP. The Editor conceives that the authority
of PARENTS is not meant by God to extend to <HI>children</HI> of
twenty-five, thirty, or <HI>forty</HI> years old.</P>
<P>As a friend, the Editor is certain she was faithful and
secret; she constantly laboured to be agreeable; and she
trusts she was obliging and complying. It is a little re∣markable,
that almost quite entire strangers to the Editor
have requested to deposite important secrets to her keeping.
She never could conceive the reason. She indeed has been
told, by more than one physiognomist, that the lines of
honesty are strongly marked in her countenance. She never
wished to know a secret, lest, as she used jokingly to say, she
<PB N="dlii" REF="566"/>
should reveal it in her sleep; she was well assured she
should not when awake.</P>
<P>As a mistress, which she became very early in life,
she endeavoured uniformly to treat every, even the
meanest servant in her house, so as, were she and they to
exchange situations the next day, she would wish them to
treat her; which once occasioned a very faucy, very wicked
vile housekeeper's saying to her, <Q REND="inline">"You may be loved for
aught I know, and I believe you are, by your servants; but,
I promise you, you will never be <HI>obeyed,</HI> nor <HI>well served,</HI>
whilst you consider them so much<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A most accomplished neighbour of Dr. Berkeley once said, <Q REND="inline">"Either Mrs Berkeley has the <HI>best</HI> servants in the kingdom, or she is the <HI>best</HI> mistress; for, when all the rest of us are complaining of our servants, you never hear her utter any thing like a complaint."</Q> This gentleman and his lovely lady are a most excellent master and mistress themselves. The Editor has in general been happy in worthy servants. She has, in the course of thirty-six years, been visited by two devils <HI>incarnate,</HI> in the capacity of housekeepers; one the <Q REND="inline">"ugliest female,"</Q> dear Lady P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> used to say, <Q REND="inline">"that ever Nature formed:"</Q> one eyebrow of one colour light, the other dark, her eyes ditto, forehead all covered with fears, not <HI>influted</HI> at Newgate, although she is a thief, but by falling into her mother's (an honest washer-woman) embers. She was a harlot to every man, gentle or simple, whom her cunning deceitful tongue could draw in, still unmarried: The other, exceedingly handsome, harlot to <HI>no</HI> man, but cursed with a very black heart indeed, married to an ex∣ceedingly worthy man. May God in mercy grant them both <Q REND="inline">"<HI>repentance unto life!</HI>"</Q> The Editor, when her friends are complaining of the worthlessness of their servants, asks them these short questions, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Do you teach</HI> them <HI>their duty</HI> to <HI>their</HI> HEAVENLY MASTER?—Do you call them daily to family prayers, and <HI>force</HI> them to hear God's word redde every day?"</Q> Did masters and mistresses of families consider that they MUST, if negligent of the souls of their servants, be infallibly accused by them <HI>for</HI> such negligence at the bar of God, surely, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>as lovers of their ownselves,</HI>"</Q> they would instruct their servants in their duty to God and man.—Want of time will not be admitted at that RIGHTEOUS BAR, on that TREMENDOUS DAY.</P>
<P>A few years ago, a groom of a very old acquaintance of the Editor, was sen∣tenced to death for a highway robbery. His master being at the Assizes, the poor wretch turned to him and cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! Lord, Sir, if I had minded what your honour said to me, when I lived with you, I had never come to this!"</Q> His worthy, remarkably, tender-hearted, master replied, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! Tom, but you would not attend to me, so I was <HI>forced</HI> to turn you off."</Q> This gentleman keeps his servants, like the Editor, as long as they are <HI>keepable.</HI> Let <HI>negligent</HI> masters and mistresses, who read the poor groom's testimony of his master's atrention to his soul, draw <HI>their own</HI> inference!!!</P>
<P>The Editor has the pleasure of knowing, that, in several instances, her <Q REND="inline">"<HI>labours with her servants have not been in vain in the</HI> LORD;"</Q> and <HI>earthly</HI> LORDS have reaped the benefit; as Mrs. Wiggins, many years the Editor's excellent, conscientious cook, now wife of Mr. Wiggins, baker in Dyot Street, St. Giles's, (a good neighbourhood!) lately told the Editor, that his Grace of York sent twice a week, all last winter, to her shop for bread; (they send none out to any one;) and that Lord Lonsdale, whilst in town, sends two horses and serants three times a week for their bread; finding that it is composed only of the best wheat flour, yeast, and salt, and is better at the week's end than the generality of bakers' bread at two days. The Editor used frequently to say, without the gift of prophecy, to this very worthy woman, <Q REND="inline">"Whenever you set up for yourself, you <HI>must</HI> prosper, you are so conscientiously careful for those you serve."</Q> It would be well if servants considered WHO it is that says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's,</HI> WHO <HI>shall give you that which is your</HI> OWN?"</Q></P></NOTE>."</Q> But the Editor ever <PB N="dliii" REF="567"/> kept in mind the
words of holy Job,
<Q REND="inline">"If I despised the cause of my man servant or my maid
servant,"</Q> &amp;c.—<Q REND="inline">"Did not HE that made <HI>me</HI> make <HI>them,</HI>"</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="dliv" REF="568"/>
As a neighbour, Mrs. Berkeley rejoiced always to render
any little kind services in the power of so unimportant a
person in the scale of beings as herself to do. She had al∣ways
a sort of <HI>giving</HI> spirit. Dr. Berkeley's very large gar∣den,
at Cookham, excellently planted and cultivated, enabled
the Editor to oblige her neighbours, high and low. Some∣times
her dairy or her larder were a convenience to her
neighbours. Had she had a park, fish-ponds, or a pidgeon∣house,
she could have done more.</P>
<P>An high Authority says, <Q REND="inline">"To whom little is given,
of them shall be little required."</Q> Had the Editor been
placed in a high station, with a large fortune, to account
for at the Great Day of Account; which she most heartily
thanks the mercy of God she has not; she must have la∣boured
more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A young man of very large fortune was one day abused by a large circle for spending it very ridiculously; one said one way, others another, in which he ought to spend it. At length, after every one had said their say, Mr. Monck Berkeley, looking very seriously, said, <Q REND="inline">"Poor young man, I pity him: I have always, from a boy, prayed earnestly to GOD, that he would never bestow more money upon me than he would give me sense and grace enough to spend as I ought to do."</Q> On which his mother, <HI>wickedly,</HI> exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear child, so then you have, I find, been praying for POVERTY all your life."</Q> To which he replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear mother, be that as it may, I always have done it, and I always shall continue to do it."</Q></NOTE>. When a young, single woman, she always
declared, <Q REND="inline">"that if the great Disposer of riches would suffer
her to choose, as a single woman, maid or widow, she
would prefer a fortune of eight hundred pounds <HI>per</HI>
<PB N="dlv" REF="569"/>
<HI>annum</HI> to one of eight thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For which her excellent Sister and an old acquaintance of hers used to laugh her to scorn, saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>She is a poor, little,</HI> unambitious soul!

same spirit was visible in an housemaid of old Lady
Draper of Sunninghill Park, grandmother of the late
amiable pious T. Baber, Esquire. Old Sir Thomas and
Lady Draper were neighbours and intimate friends of the
Editor's grandfather, the very worthy John Finch, Esquire,
of Fienes Court, in whose clothes King Charles escaped
with Lady Jane Lane. They met often; and Lady Draper, not
a <HI>modern</HI> fine lady, but one of Solomon's, looking <HI>well</HI> to the
ways of her household<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Proverbs ch. xxxi. ver. 27.</NOTE>, finding sometimes occasion for a
little objurgation; one of her honest old housemaids used to
say, <Q REND="inline">"Aye, well, my Lady may threaten what she will: BUT,
thank God, she can never make <HI>me</HI> Queen of England,
that's my comfort!"</Q> Perhaps this honest woman had
lived at Court, and seen good, quiet, mild Queen Mary
milling the old Dutchman's chocolate on her knees until
her face perspired, so as to need wiping. This, the Editor
can assert, is a fact, it having been repeatedly told to her
by her Mother, to whom it was related by Mrs. Lee,
daughter of Mr. Lee, page of the back-stairs; this lady was
the Queen's god-daughter, was perpetually with her, used
<PB N="dlvi" REF="570"/>
to read the Bible to her some hours every day. Every one
remembers, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Henrietta of Bourbon, come and draw off my

hoped, such low-bred tyrants will ride <HI>or fly</HI> to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>As a wife; when a young woman, she always resolved,
if she ever did marry, she would <HI>labour</HI> to be, what her ex∣cellent
mother was universally said to be, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The best wife in

made him a good wife, that the poor Devil might, at least,
have served out his time on earth."</Q></P>
<P>As a mother; if God vouchsafed to entrust her with the
<HI>great blessing</HI> of children, which she humbly hoped he would,
to be indefatigable in attending to their souls, their minds,
their manners, their persons, and their fortunes. It pleased
the Divine Goodness to prosper her labours in every in∣stance
but the <HI>last,</HI> certainly in her estimation the <HI>least.</HI>
She applied to one considerable gentleman, whom, she
flattered herself, gratitude (for what he had twenty-five
years before deemed <HI>great</HI> favours) would have induced
to have introduced her son to Mr. Pitt; who could, had
he been introduced, and she doubts not <HI>would,</HI> have effec∣tually
served him, and himself at the same time; but she
<PB N="dlvii" REF="571"/>
found verified, <Q REND="inline">"Put not your trust in <HI>any</HI> child of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxliv. ver. 2.</NOTE>."</Q>
This gentleman, exceedingly intimate with the Premier
from early youth, wrote the Editor, (for Dr. Berkeley said
he <HI>could not</HI> write to him,) <HI>a very</HI> polite letter of DECLINA∣TION—in
it speaking of his gratitude for Dr. Berkeley's
favours. But she did put her trust in HIM who has
never <HI>yel</HI> failed her, and to whom she daily offers praise, for
having provided, in <HI>his own</HI> BEST way, for her beloved Son;
who used often to say, <Q REND="inline">"What is to become of me, if my
health does not permit me to go to the bar?"</Q> To which
his mother constantly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Never fear, trust God's
word: <HI>Yet never saw I the righteous forsaken, nor his seed

So fearful was the Editor left her children, when they
grew up, should be tempted to marry some girl, whose
thirty, fifty, or an hundred thousand pounds had been ob∣tained
by <HI>gambling, contracting, will-making,</HI> and various other
<HI>honourable</HI> methods of obtaining a vast fortune, ever hoping
money so gained might <HI>never</HI> be brought by <HI>marriage</HI> into
<HI>her</HI> family—So strongly and so early did she inculcate this
and some other important matters on the minds of her chil∣dren,
that one little angel, who took its happy flight before
it had lived eight years and a half, one day said, <Q REND="inline">"Mamma, I
have been thinking that if you do not live till I am old

<P>The repetition of this curious dialogue at dinner, the
children not present, being gone off to school, afforded
great diversion.</P>
<P>Many persons will probably laugh at the Editor, for fre∣quently
talking to her children as if they were grown up.
She followed, in that instance, the plan pursued by her
wise mother, who, never expecting to live to see her daugh∣ters
grow up, gave them various rules of conduct, that,
could she have ensured her life, she might rather have told
them at fifteen than at eleven. One the Editor, as she
thinks it very wise, will here set down.</P>

bear the burden, always taking care to make home as

a very tender age attend seriously to what their parents say,
particularly if they love their parents, may be proved by
looking into Dodwell's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor cannot here omit heaving a sigh over the amiable daughter-in-law of this learned man, one of the three celebrated beauties at the Public Act at Oxford in 1733, before the Editor's birth; the lovely lady of Archdea∣con Dodwell, whom a very gracious Providence sent through a very deep snow on foot (one of her horses being lame) to the Editor's mother's, on the afternoon on which her angelic spirit took its happy flight to the realms of bliss, almost in an instant. Good God! what were the sufferings of the Editor and her Sister on that dreadful night? How much sorer, but for that lovely friend, who never quitted them until some time after the funeral? Sweet spirit! thou art receiving thy reward for that painful labour of love to the daughters of thy kind, thy beloved, revered friend. This lovely lady left several sons and three excellent daughters; two happy wives, the third a most amiable mourning wi∣dow; the eldest, wife of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Ridding, Esquire, of Southampton; the se∣cond, wife of the Reverend <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Holland, minister of the Duke of Somer∣set's parish in Wiltshire.

Southcombe, of Devonshire. In the possession of one of these worthy ladies, whom the Editor has not seen for some years, is probably a very curious little toy, to which perhaps the Editor may, in <HI>some</HI> measure, owe, what her friends and acquaintance used to style her very elegnt, correct taste in dress. It is certain she has <HI>turned</HI> many young ladies into <HI>beauties,</HI> by directing them to dress as became their face and person. It is wonderful all girls of sense do not attend to it, without <HI>entirely</HI> departing from that ABSOLUTE MONARCH FASHION. But to return to the toy, which she, the Editor, conceives to be <HI>now</HI> (if not always) an <HI>unique;</HI> for at no toy-shop, since she went to town at eighteen, could she ever pick up one. It is a silver case, somewhat larger, somewhat thicker, than a crown piece; on one lid is elegantly painted a beautiful young man and woman, only de∣cently covered. The case contains about ten or twelve different fine dresses painted on isinglass, which, laid on the young couple, sometimes exhibited them in one dress, sometimes in another. The Editor well remembers, in one they appear as a chimney-sweeper and his wife; but the astonishing alteration that dress produces on the human features cannot be conceived by those who have not seen this little, perhaps two hundred years old, curiosity; for the Editor never met with any person who had seen such a thing as this, except∣ing those who have seen the one here described.</NOTE> life, by Brokesby, at the age of

highly respected friend of the Editor, Captain Haddock,
the good Admiral's second son, to qualify him to hold some
commission in one division of the Kentish Militia—His
attention to the men, and their profiting, none can forget,
who frequented Canterbury Cathedral about twenty years
ago, when they were quartered in that city.</P>
<P>The Editor cannot here forbear relating a curious anec∣dote
of this excellent gentleman. Very many years ago,
when we were at war with Spain, and some considerable
town was taken, the Churches were despoiled of their fine
pictures; four or six very large exquisitely fine ones were
purchased by a Captain of a man of war, lying near the
city, and at his return to England presented to Admiral
Haddock, who had a good collection at Wrotham-Place,
the Admiral's seat: they remained in the drawing-room
many long years, the admiration of all whose eye can be
delighted by fine paintings.</P>
<P>A few years ago, on the death of the very worthy <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Haddock,
Esquire, the good Admiral's eldest son, the estate,
house, &amp;c. devolving to the Editor's pious friend; he
wrote over to the Church in Spain, whence the fine pictures
had been pillaged when the town was sacked, desiring to be
informed by what method he might restore them to the
temple whence they had been torne. The righteous offer
<PB N="dlxiv" REF="578"/>
was gratefully accepted; and Mr. Haddock has, to his real
unaffected piety, the delight of thinking, that, instead, of
<HI>robbing</HI> God, he has restored what even his ancestors did
not wrest from the temple of God. Oh, that all who have
robbed GOD in Tithes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is wished that there was a new edition of Sir Henry Spelman's History of Sacrilege; which the Editor studied hard at sixteen years old, and so incul∣cated its doctrine on her Son, that nothing would have induced him to have any thing to do with them.</NOTE> would make restitution! Our
poor Clergy of the Church of England would not then be
so straightened, even those with what are called good
livings, of three or four hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> as they
now are. What is three hundred pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> after

his wife, five children, (to be educated) and three ser∣vants?
<Q REND="inline">"If in this life <HI>only</HI> they (the Clergy) have hope
in Christ, they are of all men most miserable,"</Q> says St.
Paul.</P>
<P>On the Editor's congratulating her friend on his worthi∣ness,
his <HI>happiness</HI> on so doing; he replied, <Q REND="inline">"My dear
Madam, I only wonder that my father and brother <HI>left</HI>
it for <HI>me to do;</HI> but, I dare say, it never occurred to them
that it was practicable, or I am sure they would not have
failed to do it."</Q> What makes Mr. Haddock's merit
double is, that he loves fine pictures of sacred history, as
well as the Editor, and is an excellent judge of painting;
<PB N="dlxv" REF="579"/>
and had a small collection before he became possessed of
Wrotham-place, when he resided at Canterbury, where
Dr. Berkeley and the Editor became acquainted with him,
his worthy lady, and family.</P>
<P>It has been already mentioned that Mr. Berkeley used
to say, that <Q REND="inline">"The Editor laid all the faults, aukwardness,
&amp;c. that any man committed, on his MOTHER, excepting
what related to him as a scholar, bad Greek or Latin."</Q>
The Editor has, through life, asserted and maintained,
against <HI>some</HI> of her friends, that there are <HI>certain</HI> elegances
to be learned in the house of a father, in a certain rank of
society, <HI>before</HI> the age of fifteen, which, if not learned <HI>before</HI>
that age, <HI>are never</HI> attained; certainly the dining-room, the
drawing-room conversation of persons of good education,
must necessarily be <HI>very</HI> different from the table-talk of good
honest people in the parlour behind the shop in an Alley
in Cheapside; or in Cities where the Grammar-school is
supported by the Dean and Prebendaries, as at Canterbury,
York, Gloucester, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Editor's Canterbury chairman's son is, she hears, a
very worthy Divine; the son of Mr. B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>h's footman is a
very learned Divine; and Dr. Berkeley told the Editor, a
very few years ago, that <Q REND="inline">"the very learned Mr. Naylor,
upper master of the King's-school at Canterbury, told
him, as did some other gentlemen, that the best scholar
<PB N="dlxvi" REF="580"/>
in the school was the son of Dr. Berkeley's butcher, Ste∣phen
Couchman, then eighteen, fit for the University;
but his mother would not suffer his very rich father to
send him thither; but made him stay at home, knock
down oxen, and carry out meat."</Q> The Editor saw him,
with a basket on his shoulder, during her last visit to Can∣terbury.
This youth will be tempted to <HI>curse</HI> instead of
<HI>bless his</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> mother. The sons of such, sometimes very
worthy persons, if sent to St. Paul's, or Merchant-Tailors-School,
may be at least as good, <HI>often</HI> better <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI>
scholars, than the sons of noblemen or gentlemen; BUT
they cannot have listened, the three holyday months of the
twelve, to refined, elegant, cultivated persons' manner of
expressing their ideas and sentiments. It is not possible
that the wife of a butcher, or baker, &amp;c. should attend to
the <HI>manner</HI> in which her son pronounces the vowels, the
<HI>few</HI> vowels introduced into our English language: the
melting them all down, as the Editor frequently remarks to
her friends, may make a very good <HI>hodge-podge;</HI> but SHE
prefers, the component parts separate. The Editor well
remembers that when the WORTHY Mr. Blacowe was, for
his ZEALOUS services at Oxford, preferred by the Ministers
of George the Second to a Canonry of Windsor (sure it
had been <HI>wiser</HI> to have exalted and <HI>hidden</HI> him in some less
elegant place); a very learned, refined, cultivated friend of
the Editor's said, <Q REND="inline">"The man reads like a <HI>bargeman.</HI>"</Q> To
which the Editor replied, <Q REND="inline">"He reads like a <HI>low-born</HI> man,
<PB N="dlxvii" REF="581"/>
for he has been taught only <HI>two</HI> of the five vowels."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"What
do you mean?"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Why, he melts the E, the O,
and the U, all into one; so has only A, with which in
<HI>reading</HI> he <HI>constantly</HI> couples W, and, except when used for
<HI>ego,</HI> always metamorphoses I into U; 'He <HI>gUrdeth</HI> him∣self,
&amp;c.' and the '<HI>GUrdle</HI> of his <HI>lines,</HI>' for '<HI>loyns;</HI>' 'He
<HI>makUth</HI> the <HI>cloWEds.</HI>' The U he turns into EW, 'TREWLY,
God is loving unto Israel."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well, to be sure,"</Q> re∣plied
the gentleman, <Q REND="inline">"he does just what you say."</Q> The

not take a glass too much, for fear I should say something
and have an <HI>informaWgion</HI> against me."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor's father having taken incessant pains with his
girls, (they lost him, alas! when the eldest was just eleven
years old;) the Editor bestowed the same attention on her
children, which undoubtedly adds wonderfully to the
beauty both of speaking and reading; and she found a most
<HI>incomparable</HI> coadjutor in the exquisitely elegant Dr. Beau∣voir,
who, as Mr. John Hey, above named, frequently told
the Editor, was wonderfully <HI>strict</HI> in making the boys at
the King's school mark their vowels in speaking English
so <HI>very</HI> sharply; admiring much, how accurately Dr. Berke∣ley's
children pronounced them. Dr. Beauvoir was <HI>really</HI> a
fine gentleman, as well as a <HI>very great</HI> and elegant scholar,
<PB N="dlxviii" REF="582"/>
(of the former the Editor was a judge, her amiable partner
of the latter;) his father and mother both, as the Editor
has frequently been told, <Q REND="inline">"exquisitely elegant persons, of
antient families."</Q> Dr. Beauvoir was an exceedingly
grateful man to the family of his kind generous patron,
Dean Lynch; and also to the Editor, for the little attentions
bestowed on his daughter, Mrs. Hammond, such as some∣times
crowding her, an eighth, into her coach from a coun∣try
as well as a city rout. Dr. Berkeley used good∣humouredly
to say, (for he was ever ready to oblige, as well
as serve all,) <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My</HI> coach <HI>is</HI> the CANTERBURY HACK."</Q> Yet,
on Mrs. Berkeley's last melancholy visit there, she found
that <HI>some</HI> of those, with whom she had frequently crowded
her coach, and been reproached by Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and Miss
 <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> for so doing, could not find an uncrowded place for
her, supposing it good for an infirm, tender, half-blind, aged
matron to walk about that antient city in the dirt and rain.</P>
<P>The Editor thinks that she cannot bid adieu to Canter∣bury
without making mention of the conduct of some of
old and new friends there; of the lovely studied attentions
of the throughly amiable Mrs. Piercy—of the NEW, sweet
Mrs. Weston; and to Dr. Luxmore, from whom Mrs. Berke∣ley,
an entire stranger, on the strength of the character gi∣ven
of him by her dear Son, presumed to ask a favour for a
friend, which he most politely, most amiably granted.</P>
<P><PB N="dlxix" REF="583"/>
To the little Auditor, for NOBLE gratitude to the Wi∣dow
of the gentleman to whose indefatigable zeal he ob∣tained
that lucrative situation, when little more than a <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> boy,
for ordering the thirteen <HI>rings</HI> for his patron, instead of
being guinea rings, to be moidore, <HI>i.e.</HI> twenty-seven shilling
rings. On Mrs. Berkeley enquiring if those of any for∣mer
Prebendary or Dean had been <HI>so</HI> costly? He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, but that the widow of a worthy Apothecary, lately
deceased, had ordered such for her <HI>cousins.</HI>"</Q> To which
Mrs. Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"That, as, Dr. Berkeley was <HI>not</HI>
an <HI>Apothecary,</HI> nor the Prebendaries <HI>her cousins,</HI> guinea
ones might have done."</Q> He said, <Q REND="inline">"He had also ordered
one for <HI>himself.</HI>"</Q> Ulysses exclaims, <Q REND="inline">"Gods! how the sons
degenerate from the sires!"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley really believes
the father of this little man to be one of the most gene∣rous
of men; of what is <HI>his own,</HI> he presented to his
brother six thousand pounds. Mrs. Berkeley cannot avoid
contrasting this provident <HI>little</HI> batchelor with his near
neighbour and brother lawyer. Mrs. Berkeley, having
some law business to transact, applied to Mr. Cummyn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor earnestly wishes, that she could send Mr. Cummyn over to Ireland, that she may not be obliged to send <HI>herself</HI> into an English Cottage—for, in a Castle, or in a <HI>Cavern,</HI> she must pay the butcher and baker every Monday morning. The Editor always did, from fifteen years old, close the account of her cloaths, as well as of her house, on the last day of the old year. The cloaths account, many years of late, excepting two doleful years of mourn∣ing, did not amount to more than ten pounds; this year to little more than four; heelpiecing shoes, mending clogs, and a little black ribband, tape and thread, all regularly entered; including one pound one for a permit to hide with powder her poor, old, frizzling locks, which she has done but twice since May. Alas! why will not Mr. Pitt pity poor aged Widows, and aged Mai∣dens? It is shameful to make poor, old creatures pay a Guinea—to <HI>prevent</HI> their frighting the CROWS.</NOTE>,
<PB N="dlxx" REF="584"/>
brother of Captain Cummyn, who accompanied Admiral
Byron to Patagonia; who executed the business speedily
and well. On Mrs. Berkeley's calling one morning, to
desire her bill, he observed, <Q REND="inline">"That it was really so trifling
that it was not worth while to charge any thing."</Q> On
Mrs. Berkeley's remonstrating with him, he very po∣litely,
amiably replied, <Q REND="inline">"That it had been discharged
before it had been contracted, by Mrs. Berkeley's atten∣tion
to his wife and daughter."</Q> They were, alas! trifling.
Mrs. Berkeley was of too little importance in the world, to
benefit any one much: however, finding that although she
could <HI>not</HI> get money <HI>out</HI> of the Auditor's hands, eleven
pounds, until she had proved Dr. Berkeley's will, she
could not possibly get any into the hands of the worthy ge∣nerous
Mr. Cummyn, she found amongst her things a
little offering, which he was so obliging as to accept as a
<HI>souvenir</HI> of an old neighbour.</P>
<P>On Dr. Berkeley (then in Scotland) announcing Dr.
Beauvoir's marriage with Miss Sharpe, he said to his
son, <Q REND="inline">"Berkeley, you do not seem <HI>much astonihed</HI> at it."</Q>
<PB N="dlxxi" REF="585"/>
On which Mr. Monck Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Why no, my
dear Sir, <HI>I am not astonished at all;</HI> for, if a lady wished
for an agreeable companion, I do declare, I do not know
where she could <HI>possibly</HI> have found a more agreeable man
than <HI>my</HI> old master; and I am very glad he has got the
lady, that he may not <HI>toil</HI> on, as he used to do with <HI>us
idle</HI> dogs."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley revered those who, in his youth, <HI>laboured
to</HI> FORCE him to learn. Mention is made in the Mémoires
de le Duc de Saint Simon, of one of the Princes of the
Blood, who <HI>never would forgive</HI> his preceptor's not having
<HI>compelled</HI> him to study in his youth. He was certainly a man
of <HI>strong</HI> understanding, if not of <HI>learning.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor feels that, had not her Parents bestowed the
best education on her that money could procure, she never
could have loved them living, or respected their memory; if
<HI>she</HI> did not profit by it, the fault was <HI>her own.</HI> Mr. Monck
Berkeley was quite of his mother's mind. A rather di∣verting
anecdote, shewing Mr. Monck Berkeley's ideas
concerning education when a boy, is here subjoined.</P>
<P>The very grateful agreeable Mr. Taswell, Rector of
Aylsham, in Norfolk, wrote to Dr. Berkeley, saying, <Q REND="inline">"That
he meant to wait on him for two or three days in his
way to town, and he hoped Mrs. Berkeley would permit
<PB N="dlxxii" REF="586"/>
him to bring his little girl, who was going to town to
visit an aunt."</Q> The day before their arrival Mr. Monck
Berkeley said to his father, <Q REND="inline">"I suppose, as soon as ever
breakfast is over, and Mamma has been to the larder,
and ordered dinner, she will take Miss Taswell up stairs,
get the French and Italian grammars and the maps, and
teach her <HI>all</HI> her lessons over, and examine her <HI>throughly.</HI>"</Q>
Dr. Berkeley was wonderfully diverted with his <HI>son's idea,</HI>
(not then thirteen years old, as Mrs. Berkeley always told
her children, <Q REND="inline">"that as soon as ever they entered their <HI>teens,</HI>
the words <HI>Papa</HI> and <HI>Mamma</HI> were to be laid aside for <HI>my
Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> when speaking <HI>of</HI> their parents—<HI>Sir,</HI> and
<HI>Madam,</HI> as usual, when speaking <HI>to</HI> them;"</Q>) and ex∣claimed,
<Q REND="inline">"You monkey, do <HI>you think,</HI> because your Mamma
<HI>worries</HI> herself every day of her life to <HI>teach you,</HI>
that she will plague herself to teach other children? No,
no; nothing but her <HI>violent</HI> love of <HI>you</HI> could make her
slave as she does. Your mother's delight is in <HI>learning,</HI> not
in <HI>teaching.</HI> I wish to God you had your mother's rage for
knowledge: it would be a happy thing for you."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley certainly had that rage from her very early
youth, and it continued with her until she lost her idol. It
is not yet quite extinct; the flame is out, but the embers
still glow a little.</P>
<P><PB N="dlxxiii" REF="587"/>
A wonderfully, well-informed, respected friend, the Lady
of the late Governor <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, being in the Editor's room
(many years ago) mentioned something in Astronomy that
was new to the Editor; she sprang out upon the stair-case,
and called out to Mrs. (then Miss) Frinsham, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Sister, sister,</HI>
come hither this minute, and Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> will make
you as wise as SOLOMON."</Q> Mrs. Frinsham, dressing
for dinner, said, <Q REND="inline">"I am without my cloaths."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Never
mind your cloaths,</HI> but come directly."</Q> The worthy lady
laughed so violently, that it recovered Mrs. Berkeley from
her extacy of joy on gaining some addition to her delight∣ful,
if not useful, knowledge. It has often been the sub∣ject
of mirth to the three friends. Mrs. Berkeley, also
dressing, disengaged herself like lightning from under the
hands of her maid.</P>
<P>But to return to the uncommonly sensible, amiable, very
highly accomplished Miss Taswell. <HI>She</HI> needed no instruc∣tion
from Mr. Berkeley's mother. Her own excellent
father, throughly sensible of the blessing of a good education,
has spared no pains, no cost, to bestow it on his daughters.
The young lady above named, her father a few months ago,
when he visited the Editor, told her, he was going to lose.
Happy the young gentleman who gains her. The Edi∣tor
knows him not; but, if he is not a happy husband,
she is <HI>firmly</HI> persuaded that the fault must be <HI>entirely</HI> in
himself.</P>
<P><PB N="dlxxiv" REF="588"/>
The Editor has known and admired the merits of Miss
Taswell since she was <HI>seven</HI> years old: at that very early
period, by the wise care of her mother, she was absolutely
better qualified to conduct a <HI>moderate</HI> sized family, than
most of the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Misses of seventeen are now.</P>
<P>The Editor often wishes to be told what it is that mo∣dern
young ladies are taught; but nobody that she meets

they have ear or <HI>no</HI> ear matters not; and to speak a sort of
gibberish, something in short that is not English, for

of Sir Justinian Isham, must have envied those who did
visit her. This agreeable worthy lady is introduced here
on account of a repartee of hers to her father, when it is
probable young ladies dressed so as to make conquests of
worthy sensible men. Alas for sweet Mrs. Isham and a
most amiable young gentleman, <HI>she</HI> did! BUT, by the <HI>perverse∣ness</HI>
of a father on one side, and the covetousness of an
uncle on the other, it was <HI>decreed</HI> they were <HI>not</HI> to be united.
The gentleman died of a <HI>broken heart</HI> very soon; the lady
survived about forty years, resolved never to marry. The
<HI>lovelorn tale,</HI> too long to be inserted here, is never related
by the Editor without filling her eyes with tears, after
which she amuses herself and her auditors by <HI>execrating</HI> the
<HI>father</HI> and <HI>uncle.</HI></P>
<P>After the death of Lady Isham, <HI>ald Sir Jus</HI> (as he was
always styled) thought, <HI>very unwisely,</HI> he would <HI>abridge</HI> the
young ladies of their <HI>annual</HI> visit to London. They gave
several broad hints. At length the abovenamed lady said,
<Q REND="inline">"Dear Sir, I hope you will let us go to town this spring."</Q></P>
<P>Sir Jus.—<Q REND="inline">"To town, girls! What should you go to
town for? No, no; you are very happy here in the
country."</Q></P>
<P>Young Lady.—<Q REND="inline">"But we want to buy some new
cloaths, Sir."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dlxxix" REF="593"/>Sir Jus.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>New cloaths, indeed!</HI> Why the Scripture
tells you, that the KING'S DAUGHTER was all-glorious

<P>Mrs. Isham.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir; but it also tells us, that <HI>her
cloathing was of wrought gold;</HI> and we wish to resemble
her outwardly, as well as inwardly."</Q></P>
<P>The wit of the young lady prevailed, one cannot say
over the <HI>wisdom</HI> of the father. To do justice to Sir Justi∣nian,
finding, that, by his parsimony, he had doomed his
lovely daughter to perpetual celibacy, he bequeathed her a
much larger fortune than he gave to any of his other younger
children; but, to be sure, one must say, that, had Botany
Bay been discovered, he deserved to have been exiled thi∣ther;
and the sensible, amiable Mr. R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>'s rich old
uncle ought to have been hanged outright, without benefit
of clergy, for forcing a rich fool into the arms of his nephew.
Alas! the actors <HI>of</HI> and <HI>in</HI> this tragedy are all now retired

<P>It always provokes the Editor to hear a stupid father or
mother telling poor girls that they are <HI>happier</HI> at their el∣bow,
than at the race-ball. No, let young people have
a reasonable share of <HI>innocent</HI> amusement. Why should
man be more rigid than God, who says, by his Prophet

The Editor never suffered Mr. Monck Berkeley to call
her Mamma after he entered his teens, telling him it was
like a lamb, but, when speaking of her, always "My Mo∣ther;"
of course, from the time he could articulate,
"Madam," when speaking to her.</P>
<P>The Editor holds in detestation the idea of children, of
whatever age, calling their parents <HI>Mr.</HI> or <HI>Mrs.</HI> when speaking
to them; insomuch that, sometimes, when the Editor, after
Mr. Monck Berkeley was grown up, has been inattentive to
what her Son was saying to her after he had called <HI>Madam</HI>
two or three times, he would say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Madam; if you
will not listen to me, <HI>I protest</HI> I will call you Mrs. Berke∣ley."</Q>
It has always had the desired effect, procuring an
answer; <Q REND="inline">"And I <HI>protest,</HI> if you do, <HI>I will knock</HI> you down."</Q></P>
<P>The last ridotto before the Editor married, at about eight
in the evening, thus late by her own request, the famous
Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, hair-dresser, attended her, to try to make her
wonderfully curling hair, like an African's, keep straight,
as was the fashion then, for a few hours. Observing the
poor man ready to faint, she asked, <Q REND="inline">"if she should order the
servant to bring him a glass of wine."</Q> On its arrival, the
Editor asked, <Q REND="inline">"if he would have a bit of toast."</Q> He re∣plied,
<Q REND="inline">"She was very good; and if it would not be too
much trouble to Mr. Joseph," (a very worthy grey-headed
servant of Mrs. Frinsham and the Editor before her mar∣riage,)
<PB N="dlxxxi" REF="595"/>
"he should be very glad, for that he had not tasted
bit or sup since eight in the morning—had been flying
over the town to ladies."</Q> The Editor pitying him, he
said, <Q REND="inline">"He was used to it all the Winter, in a greater or less
degree—that he seldom got hom to dinner till six o'clock,
a <HI>ton</HI> hour now—that he often begged Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> (his
wife) not to wait for him."</Q></P>
<P>This so struck the Editor, that the next day she conjured
Dr. (then Mr.) Berkeley, that if ever she became his wife,
(which she did on the Easter Tuesday following), he would
never call her MRS. BERKELEY, but his WIFE, when he
spoke of her, and by her Christian name when he spoke
<HI>to</HI> her, wishing to be <Q REND="inline">"some how,"</Q> as we Berkshire folks
say, distinguished from her hair-dresser's <HI>lady,</HI> who a few
years after, by the death of a rich old miller, his uncle,
kept a chariot, and saved Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> the trouble of waiting
dinner for him. He then ceased to wait on the ladies.
He was an excellent hair-dresser—the Editor hopes he made
a good Esquire.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE EDITOR takes this opportunity of publishing her
heartfelt gratitude to several excellent friends, who have
most generously, most kindly, most amiably, assisted her in
various ways, since her being left forlorn and desolate, to
struggle, to wade though much intricate, unpleasant, some
<HI>quite unexpected</HI> business.—Her gratitude to her old excel∣lent
friend, Sir Richard Hill;—to Dr. Berkeley's old friend,
the Dean of Hereford;—to the throughly amiable hearted
Dr. Lynch, Prebendary of Canterbury;—and to the very
grateful Reverend Charles Sawkins, Student of Christ
Church, have been already noticed.</P>
<P>The Editor wants an abler pen than her own to express
what she feels for the exceedingly great kindness of that
unwearied friend, Commissioner Hey of the Customs;
with whose exquisite wit the Editor's spirit has not been
regaled for many years, until an opportunity presented it∣self
of shewing, what the Editor has long known, that
brilliant as that gentleman's wit is, his worth exceeds it,
as numbers benefited by it can testify. The amiability of
<PB N="dlxxxiii" REF="597"/>
that gentleman's heart was ever admired by Dr. Berkeley.
What does he now feel towards him and every kind wor∣thy
friend of his perplexed Widow!</P>
<P>The excellent, generous Mr. Wilberforce, the Editor,
although very highly obliged to his goodness, has never
yet seen.</P>
<P>To the very obliging, polite Mr. Edwards, Bookseller in
Pall Mall, the Editor is much indebted, for very judicious,
kind advice, given in a matter of which the Editor had not
a competent knowledge, and of which Mr. Edwards was
an excellent judge.</P>
<P>The Editor is likewise much indebted to the very worthy
Printer of Mr. Monck Berkeley's Poems, and to his Compo∣sitors,
for the patience they have shewn in <HI>deciphering</HI> the
<HI>crowded, interlined,</HI> generally ill-written sheets of this Preface,
in which are few errors of the <HI>press,</HI> although many of the <HI>pen.</HI></P>
<P>The Editor, when writing a common letter in haste,
sometimes leaves out three words of a sentence, occasioned
by a vile trick contracted in early youth, of softly saying her
sentence as she is writing; and, dull as her wits now are,
they reverse the old Proverb, <Q REND="inline">"of not letting one's tongue
run before one's wit;"</Q> for the Editor wishes that her pen
could only keep pacc with her wits: slow as they now are, it
<PB N="dlxxxiv" REF="598"/>
would save her friends, the few who are still <HI>visited</HI> by
her letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Editor means here to adopt, rather to <HI>adapt,</HI> a Scottish fashion. The people of North Britain have many clever, some elegant ones. Of the latter, is the always going dressed in a black gown or coat, the first visit after the family visited have lost a near relation. The Editor has constantly practised it since her return from Scotland. Just before the Editor set out for Scotland she was driven by her dear Son several miles in the phaëton, to make one of these distressing visits at the house of a—not very distant relation, where they met half the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>fine folk</HI>"</Q> of Berks. They were fine in a double sense, as they were persons of fashion, all clad in red, blue, green, &amp;c. ladies and gentle∣men. Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> was very elegantly, very gaily dressed. Mr. Berkeley and his Mother, of course in mourning, and the mourning of both was internal as well as external. On driving out of the court yard, the Edi∣tor, as if she had taken a peep at Scotland, said to her Son, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Berkeley, it has really sickened me to see so many gaudy colours in this house of mourning."</Q> One of the former is an article in the Edin∣burgh newspapers. After the death inserted, <Q REND="inline">"It is hoped his or her relations will accept <HI>this</HI> notification of his or her death."</Q> The Editor having been obliged, on account of the tender health of her last near, and exceedingly dear relative, her excellent sister, to quit the clear, fine, sharp air of Datchet Ter∣race, for the mild soft air of Surrey, has taken a house at Chertsey, where she expects to be quite beggared by postage. One penny for every newspaper. Well, what is that? Why, thirteen shillings <HI>per annum</HI> addition for the Saint James's Chronicle; one penny with every scrawl she puts <HI>into</HI> the post, and one penny with <HI>every</HI> letter that she gets by the post, frank or no frank. The names of her two kind <HI>pocket</HI> M.P.'s, as she always styles her two excellent old friends Sir Richard Hill and Sir Robert Laurie, avail no more than were they, instead of two most excellent Senators, the two heroes of an old ballad sung to the Editor by her mother's maids when she was a girl, which begins,<Q><L>"Robert and Richard were two pretty men;</L>
<L>"And they lay a-bed till the clock it struck ten," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Editor, unless her new neighbour Mr. Fox, or somebody, can get a post <HI>to</HI> Chertsey, must, if GOD spares her life, once a quarter, insert in the Saint James's Chronicle, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>This is to certify those whom it may con∣cern, that Mrs. George Berkeley is still living at Chertsey, Surrey.</HI>"</Q> She has, this day (December 12, 1796), received eight letters. Besides the postage, she pays a penny each to the civil old man, who brought them <HI>from</HI> Stains, that is eight-pence; and, as every one must be answered, eight-pence more to carry them to Stains; so that she is now fully resolved seriously to tell all her friends, that she cannot afford to receive or answer their kind letters, al∣though they should be franked. As to those of her foes, she will not suffer her servants to take in a letter in an unknown hand. The franking bill and paper tax will soon reduce FEMALES to a state of barbarism again, as the Editor con∣ceives. The Editor is resolved to advise all her female acquaintance to give up letter-writing; even her few young friends, to wait and give <HI>vivâ voce</HI> the ac∣count of their <HI>conquests, cruelty,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. accounts of lovers old and new, to their friend. Dr. Berkeley always said, <Q REND="inline">"If the Minister once gets the House of Commons to give up franking it is over with them. Like Sampson, they become weak like other men."</Q> Since sending this to press, the Editor is told by her servant, that the letters, when carried to the civil, humble Post∣man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letters are all deposited in a very large heap, on a neat, clean, white dresser, whence one may as easily <HI>take,</HI> as <HI>lay,</HI> a letter—but the Editor has no Bank Bills to <HI>send off.</HI></NOTE>, who always came, like the roll-boy, &amp;c. with one knock, until the Editor advised him to feel his <HI>own</HI> consequence, and give two <HI>smart</HI> raps, as <HI>other</HI> Postmen every where do, and as he now does. The wor∣thy man said, <Q REND="inline">"He hoped people would not think it <HI>presuming</HI> in him."</Q> Good, humble man, perhaps he may sometimes be charged with a letter—from the COUNTESS OF PUDDLEDOCK, (vide Faery Tale,) or some such great Personage, to some Chertsey trader,—or perhaps a sheet to the Editor,—who, if on a Saint's-day, can hardly get time before three o'clock, when she <HI>must</HI> eat her dinner; and the post sets off for Stains at <HI>five</HI> o'clock: so letter-writing is here handsomely taken leave of by the Editor; and for the St. James's Chronicle, she will order them to lie till some neighbour goes to town, who will bring them postage free—sit down, and read a batch together, as she has heard is done in the East Indies; for which she has often pitied the <HI>poor,</HI> rich Nabobesses. They may now pity <HI>her.</HI> It must hurt the revenue, the abridging girls of writing. <Q REND="inline">"What <HI>reams</HI> of paper, as Lady B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r used to say, did the Editor and her Ladyship's lovely niece <HI>waste,</HI> in writing to each other!"</Q> Her Ladyship had no <HI>great</HI> talents for letter-writing; and here the Editor ABJURES it, and advises all her acquaintance and friends to do it, except some friend will take charge of a letter, and then, as is frequently the case, <HI>forget to deliver it.</HI> Since writing the above, the Editor finds that the clever way of getting to, and sending letters from, Chertsey is with a yard of ribbon or small piece of cloth, &amp;c. for, what with the opposition coaches and waggon, the carriages that pass and repass from London to Chertsey, are going nearly, the Editor believes, quite half a score times every day, Sundays NOT excepted, which makes it exceedingly convenient indeed, and very reasonable. Blessings on opposition! may all the inhabitants of Chertsey and its <HI>environs</HI> say. Bishop Berkeley used to say, <Q REND="inline">"It is <HI>over</HI> with <HI>England</HI> when there is NO opposition. <HI>But</HI> it should be kept under."</Q></P></NOTE>, a vast deal of trouble—and herself also, if she

The Prophet exclaims, <Q REND="inline">"Are there none amongst all the

<P>There are four Irish gentlemen, every one men of large
fortune and appointments, whose <HI>only</HI> home, for very many
years' residence at Eton and Harrow School, (for the three
months holydays of every year,) was the house of their
relation, Dr. Berkeley.</P>
<P>To the Etonian, a gentleman of many thousand pounds
a year, for ages in the family, his sweetly amiable father
constantly took care to <HI>make</HI> Dr. Berkeley's Irish debtors
pay with tolerable punctuality. If they did not, by the
<PB N="dlxxxvii" REF="601"/>
generosity of his excellent, kind relation Mr. Monck of
Grange Gormond, father of the Marchioness of Waterford,
it was pretty much the same to Dr. Berkeley; Mr. Monck
saying to his amiable brother, <Q REND="inline">"Whether Dr. Berkeley's
people pay or not, remit his money regularly on my ac∣count;
they will pay some time or other."</Q> Such
favours can never be obliterated from a grateful
mind. The three others had <HI>no</HI> such claim, nor any
claim—and on their arrival at Harrow School in the
year 1766, their uncle said they were to remain seven
years, the year round, holydays and all, as school-boys.
The Editor felt for them, and besought Dr. Berkeley to let
them come to him. He replied, <Q REND="inline">"I will not have YOU
tormented with all the BRATS of my Irish relations,
turning yourself into a <HI>boarding dame.</HI>"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley
conjured Dr. Berkeley to send the coach to fetch them for
three or four days, that she might see what sort of geniuses
they were, and, if they were well behaved, a little mutton,
&amp;c. would not be much expence in a family of thirteen or
fourteen persons. Accordingly she prevailed—as women
generally do, with wise men, if their aim is worthy, and
they set <HI>rightly</HI> about it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soon after Dr. Berkeley's marriage, a younger brother of Dr. Joshua Berke∣ley, now Dean of Tuam (whose only <HI>English</HI> home, during his stay at Westminster school, and long after, at Christ Church, Oxon, was Dr. Berkeley's house), came with his worthy eldest brother, and his youngest, to visit Dr. Berkeley at Bray. The youth, for whom Dr. Berkeley had procured a studentship of Christ Church, fell ill of the small-pox; and Dr. Berkeley's mother, then at his house, thought it <HI>better</HI> that the Editor, who had never had the small-pox, should leave the house, rather than Master William Berkeley, although Mr. Falwasser the Apothecary assured her there was not the least danger attended the removing the youth. It very nearly cost the Editor her life; she lost her infant; and the taking a ready-furnished house to reside in for three months, scouring, <HI>spoiling</HI> beds, curtains, &amp;c. lest the Editor should get the small-pox (that, in her family, <HI>direful</HI> disease) cost Dr. Berkeley an hundred pounds. He SENSIBLY felt the <HI>only</HI> return he met with from his uncle, or either of his learned sons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="dlxxxviii" REF="602"/>
Mrs. Berkeley is sorry to be obliged to say, that neither
of these gentlemen, who used to weep <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The late amiable Mr. Henchman, of All Souls, coming in one day, saw Charles <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, Esq. with his arms round Mrs. Berkeley's neck, sobbing, and the tears flowing plentifully from the Editor's eyes, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"What is the matter?

I am sure <HI>she is an excellent mother to them;</HI> and the coach has been at the gate this half hour to carry them to Harrow."</Q> This gentleman paid attention to Mr. Monck Berkeley when in Ireland; and on Mrs. Berkeley's writing to him a few years ago, requesting him to make enquiry in Dublin, concerning a young gentleman, son of a Canterbury neighbour, just then married to an Irish lady, of good family, and, as the event has proved, merit; he obligingly complied—and in one of his letters <HI>politely</HI> said he had not forgotten favours received at Dr. Berkeley's. The Editor's friend, Mrs. D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, says that Ireland is <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the land</HI> where all things are forgotten."</Q> This lady has or had one <HI>vaut-rien</HI> friend, an English woman, who marrying greatly in Ireland, as most English women do, gave herself high airs, and forgot her English friends. She took care that the late excellent Mrs. G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l should not forget her; for she drew upon her regularly for an annuity that generous woman had settled upon her when a <HI>poor English</HI> beauty!!!</NOTE> bitterly when leaving

Berkeley, whom the Editor never saw until about three years
before the death of Dr. Berkeley, and whom she, with all her
rhetoric, could not persuade Dr. Berkeley to invite to his
house at holyday times, he saying, <Q REND="inline">"You shall not be <HI>de∣voured</HI>
by my relations. Kippax has uncles in England."</Q>
To this gentleman she has, since her loss of Dr. Berkeley,
been obliged for some assistance in her Irish affairs, and she
has endeavoured to shew her gratitude otherwise than by
mere words.</P>
<P>The Editor, before she finally closes this Postscript,
wishes to repeat to her few remaining friends in distant
parts, (for, alas! numbers have, within a short space, gone
to those distant shores whence they <HI>cannot return</HI> until TIME
shall be no more,) her change of abode since the writing
and printing the Dedication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Monck Berkeley, early in life, made, to himself, a solemn pro∣mise, that he would never write a Dedication during his life, lest, as he used to say, the Devil should tempt him to flatter with his pen, knowing he would not with his tongue.</NOTE>; that—although she cannot
now boast of keeping, as she used to do when resident at
the Oaks, the <HI>best</HI> and <HI>cheapest</HI> inn at Canterbury, where
she had often the pleasure of returning the amiable atten∣tions
paid to her Son in town by persons to whom neither
his Father or Mother had the honour to be known, and as
<PB N="dxc" REF="604"/>
they <HI>sometimes</HI> found the <HI>pleasure</HI> of being acquainted with—she
resides at present at Chertsey; where, when she receives
any money from Ireland, to pay the butcher and baker
<HI>every</HI> Monday morning, she will be happy to see any <HI>real</HI>
friend, and <HI>poor</HI> desolate females, whether widows or mai∣dens,
who are too poor to be courted, too old to be flat∣tered—they
need not <HI>dread</HI> being <HI>crowded</HI> with company. An
amiable friend of Mr. Monck Berkeley's youth frequently
does the Editor the honour to say, <Q REND="inline">"that he should esteem
it an honour if she would spend some weeks at his seat,
with himself and his lovely lady."</Q> The Editor wickedly,
it is wickedly as she is persuaded he is sincere, laughs, and
says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Invite</HI> on; press, Tommy. You are very safe, I as∣sure
you; for I shall never visit you."</Q> If the Editor's life
should be spared until next summer, and she can prevail on
her sister to accompany her, she means to go for one week;
as, were it not so distant, she would be happy to accept the
throughly polite invitation of Mr. Monck Berkeley's highly
respected old Eton, St. Andrew's, friend, the very amiable,
very grateful (for slight favours received at St. Andrew's),
Mr. Hume, son of the late Lord Bishop of Sarum, nephew
to Lord Kinnoul. Mr. Berkeley always spoke in high terms
of Mr. Hume's worth when an Etonian. The Editor re∣joices
to hear that he is so happily married. Long may he
enjoy his felicity on earth! late exchange it for higher
felicity!</P>

<HEAD>THE EDITOR TO HER CORRESPONDING FRIENDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor having publicly declared war with one of
her favourite amusements from ten years old, at present
her only remaining one, letter-writing, rather letter∣<HI>scribbling;</HI>
unluckily for her, for her friends, she <HI>too</HI> early
in life lighted on that passage in one of Dean Swift's Letters,
<Q REND="inline">"that he never leaned on his elbow, when writing a letter,
to study or think what he was to write, but set down
just what came into his head, or occurred at the mo∣ment."</Q>
The Editor <HI>then</HI> thought it <HI>very clever;</HI> so it
might, perhaps, for such a brilliant genius as Dean Swift,
but not for Miss Frinsham. At fifteen, however, the
habit was <HI>unluckily</HI> contracted, and every one who has ever
redde only <HI>once</HI> Dr. Johnson's delightful VISION of THE∣ODORE,
must remember the astonishingly beautiful de∣scription
of HABITS. Perhaps good ones, in early life, are
<HI>almost</HI> as easily contracted as bad ones, at least so a learned
<HI>beathen</HI> Philosopher tells us: but <HI>he knew not</HI> the <HI>doctrine</HI>
<PB N="dxcii" REF="606"/>
of ORIGINAL SIN, although all thinking impartial Beings
must <HI>feel</HI> it in themselves.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley here takes leave to recommend to those
Friends to whom she may not yet have recommended them,
as she knows she has to many, to purchase, and read,
<HI>every</HI> day, two little books—BOGATSKY. When recom∣mending
that excellent little volume (the York edition is
correct) to her old neighbour, Mr. Bristow of Canterbury,
to fell, he assured her, <Q REND="inline">"that BOGATSKY was <HI>all the fashion;</HI>
that vast numbers of LADIES (not Gentlemen) bought
it."</Q> Mrs. Frinsham uses wittily to say, <Q REND="inline">"The reason
that Men do not kneel at Church, or attend to their
souls out of Church, is, because GOD has made <HI>them</HI>
LORDS of the Creation."</Q></P>
<P>The second book is the "Hymns," not "Psalms," of
the seraphic Dr. Isaac Watts, and read <HI>one</HI> Hymn every
morning. The Day of Bogatsky, and the Hymn of Watts,
may both be <HI>dispatched</HI> in less than seven minutes. Mrs.
Berkeley supposes, that in near thirty years she has scarce
missed thirty times, invigorating her Faith and Love to
Christ by Dr. Watts; and her blood boils with indignation
at the caution she lately saw in the Saint James's Chronicle
against a SOCINIAN edition of those divine Hymns. It
appears to her <HI>impossible</HI> that they can be garbled by those
wretches, where every fourth or fifth line does so exalt the
<PB N="dxciii" REF="607"/>
Saviour of Sinners. Surely none have exceeded, <HI>few</HI>
equalled, that Divine Man in, incessantly in his writings,
holding up to view the co-equal co-eternal GODHEAD of
the SON and SPIRIT as Dr. ISAAC WATTS. His sweet
spirit has been long worshiping<FIGURE>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>Why is not that emblem over every altar in every country
church, as the Editor has seen it in some few little obscure
village churches, particularly in that of <HI>West</HI> Peckham in
West Kent, surrounded with a beautiful nimbus. <HI>Children,
babes</HI> of sense, would then ask what it was?</P>
<P>There has long been a train laid by the Socinian and
Arian <HI>Friends</HI> of Satan to undermine good Dr. Watts.
There was a hint in a set of Bampton Lectures several
years ago, that <HI>latterly</HI> that pious man was not quite so
strenuous, &amp;c. as formerly. The fact is, for many years
his fine faculties (too much used) failed, and villains got in
and asked him ensnaring questions, which he forgot before
he answered. It had been happy had he done as poor,
pious, <HI>very</HI> weak, Bishop Latimer did, when examined by
the PIOUS, <HI>charitable</HI> Papists of <HI>bloody</HI> MARY: <Q REND="inline">"I am be∣come
old and foolish. I won't answer a word to any
question you ask me. Go, and read what I printed when
<PB N="dxciv" REF="608"/>
I was in vigour; and, if you don't like it, burn me for
that."</Q> And so they very kindly did, shortening his then
dull journey to glory.</P>
<P>As this sheet is not written for the Publick at large, but <HI>en∣tirely</HI>
for Mrs. George Berkeley's Correspondents, <HI>i.e.</HI> her kindly
curious friends, who want to know <Q REND="inline">"what <HI>sort</HI> of place
she has <HI>thrust</HI> herself into;"</Q> she here, <HI>sine postage,</HI> thus
writes: Her dear friend Mrs. Duncombe has, <Q REND="inline">"many a
long year ago,"</Q> celebrated the beauties of the environs,
the <HI>exteriour</HI> of Chertsey: if she will be pleased to insert
her account in the Gentleman's Magazine, she will
oblige her numerous friends, and delight many readers
of that very sensible work. For the <HI>interiour,</HI> the
Editor has already described the excellent Preacher; and
in all times <HI>hitherto</HI> CHURCH has the precedency of State.
The Editor will follow <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the good old way.</HI>"</Q> The building
has but one AILE, so it will not probably <HI>fly</HI> away; and
she hopes the DEMOCRATES will not pluck its one aile and
level it with the ground; for Mrs. B. had rather hobble to
it on the <HI>little</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Mrs. Berkeley asking Mr. Whitaker, how it came to pass, when almost every little town in England was well paved, that this had escaped being <Q REND="inline">"<HI>in the fashion;</HI>"</Q> he replied, <Q REND="inline">"Bless me, my dear Madam, did <HI>you</HI> never hear <HI>how it came to be</HI> so paved?"</Q> Mrs. Berkeley foolishly expecting to hear, by Romans, or Saxons, or Danes, earnestly said, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, no; <HI>do pray tell me.</HI>"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why, the <HI>tradition</HI> is, that the DEVIL paved it <HI>himself,</HI> that people might not go to Church."</Q> Mrs. Berkeley's father used to say, that it must certainly have been the Devil who built the Church at Great Marlow, quite at the extre∣mity, indeed, out of that very long town, close to the Thames. An odd circumstance occurred one Sunday, almost forty years ago. Mrs. Berkeley, on a visit there, of course at Church, a barge stranded, just as the worthy Dr. Cloberry was devoutly reading the third commandment, a perplexed bargeman, without the sacred walls, uttered the following words, di∣stinctly heard by all the congregation, <Q REND="inline">"G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n your hands, why <HI>doan't</HI> you pull that rope?"</Q> The inhabitants of Marlow then had one most ex∣cellent custom; it were to be wished that it were practised in other places. During Divine Service, at no fixed regular time, the Churchwardens, at∣tended by other proper persons, take up their white wands, walk out of Church, and walk through the town, inspect the alehouses; and Mrs. Berkeley conceives the Marlow Publicans do not resemble <HI>one</HI> at Cookham, who used to shut up his <HI>front</HI> door, and receive a vast deal of <HI>good</HI> company through his garden, at his <HI>back</HI> door. But his <HI>landlord</HI> was one of the WORTHY Cookham Brewers, risen from being <HI>humbly thankful</HI> for a horn of fine ale when working hard at Dr. Berkeley's at Bray as a Cooper—to <HI>making</HI>—ale at Cookham, and, together with a Dissenting Baker, during the Sequestration after Dr. Berkeley re∣signed the living of Cookham, although he rented the house of his suc∣cessor, shewed their love of power in a very extraordinary manner in∣deed; the Brewer sending repeated orders that Dr. Berkeley's cows should not be in the church-yard, the cattle have no other way to get at the Thames to drink; and the Baker bringing his linen up a ladder over a wall repeatedly to dry them on the premises, which he said were become his; not in the drying-ground appropriated for that purpose, but tying his ropes to the two finest mulberry-trees in Berkshire, with which Mrs. Berkeley regaled all her neighbours far and near, rich and poor, and would as soon have suffered her maids to have dried her linen on them, as to have washed it in her Dresden china: but beggars set on horseback <HI>generally</HI> ride <HI>briskly.</HI> Whether ABRAHAM and LEVI considered them∣selves <HI>great folk</HI> as descendants of the Father of the Faithful, or as COOKHAM <HI>Parish officers,</HI> Mrs. Berkeley knows not, but conceives the latter. Mrs. Berkeley, telling the late very sensible worthy Mr. Stone, Carpenter, of Cookham, and Churchwarden, that he had never sent his cloaths to dry, or sent for fruit, or made the Vicarage Garden a publick walk, as Mr. Withers, the Curate appointed by the Parish did, he shook his head, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Good Madam, that paper from the Archdeacon's Court was only matter of form: there was no need for us to take care of any premises that Dr. Berkeley was in possession of."</Q> Dr. Berkeley and this worthy man, between them, had taken care of his soul: he collected the Offering at the Altar on Sunday, looking, good man, as if really dead; and expired in peace the next Tuesday. On being advised on Sunday not to go to church because he was dying, he re∣plied, <Q REND="inline">"I know it, and therefore I will go."</Q> His health had been long in a very declining state. He was a very throughly honest, just man, as I well know, he having done all Dr. Berkeley's work for many years; and I, of course, always overlooked and paid his very reasonable remarkably just bills.</NOTE> round pebbles, than walk <HI>smoothly</HI> over its

foundation, as she did the last time she was in France
over a Cathedral, where she had some few years before
worshiped GOD in <HI>her own way,</HI> whilst a noble organ
was playing the service during the celebrating, not
<PB N="dxcvi" REF="610"/>
L'OFFICE DE SAUVEUR, in which she could well join.
To tell you that we have no organ at Chertsey, would
be to tell an untruth; as Mrs. Berkeley hears, by report,
that the Presbyterians have so far given up the ideas of
their ancestors as to suffer the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Devil's whistle</HI>"</Q> to be played constantly in their Meeting-houses in many places, adopting, 'tis to be feared, the <HI>Popish</HI> doctrine of doing and
<HI>hearing</HI> EVIL that good may come, drawing thereby many
from the Church of England worship. However, to con∣sole
US in the Parish Church for the want of an organ, we
have a most extraordinary Clerk, who, no doubt, con∣ceive
<PB N="dxcvii" REF="611"/>
that his prayers are as prevalent as those of ELIJAH
THE PROPHET. On my arrival here, Mrs. Frinsham told
me that we had a very extraordinary Clerk indeed; but
that she was told <HI>she would, in time,</HI> get used to <HI>his</HI> mode
of praying. She expressed her wonder that it did not
perplex the Officiating Clergymen. She would not tell
me what it was, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I should hear for myself."</Q> Ar∣riving
here on the Saturday evening, I, of course, at∣tended
Divine Service twice on Sunday, as also on week∣days
and the following Sunday. Having been taught, from
early youth, always to follow, never precede the Clerk in
the Confession, Psalms, and Responses, I was exceedingly
puzzled indeed when I came to the Litany. I rubbed my
eyes, wiped my glasses, but all in vain, to find out what
the poor honest Clerk said, as the words WE and FOR are
<HI>so very</HI> different in their sound, and, thanks be to God,
my ears are as quick as my poor eyes are dull—very
remarkably quick always; that it was not, till several
times after giving the utmost attention, that I discovered
that this good man, probably conceiving that HIS prayers,
as Clerk, being louder than the rest of the Congregation,
are <HI>better</HI> heard in Heaven, he very kindly, in the Litany,
instead of saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord,</HI>"</Q>
says, FOR I beseech Thee to hear US, good Lord. Most of
the great Churches in town have what is called a Clerk in
Orders; I believe they seldom officiate themselves, but ge∣nerally
by deputy; but if they do, although in Priests
<PB N="dxcviii" REF="612"/>
Orders, I fancy they do not supplicate for the Congregation
as this <HI>zealous</HI> Clerk does. There are several other curious
<HI>varieties,</HI> but this may suffice to shew how <HI>happy</HI> we are
in a Clerk. Pews are here exceedingly scarce; and the
good Lady who <HI>rented</HI> this house before I took it, when
she quitted the town, bequeathed her <HI>non</HI>-right in the
pew in which she sat to a <HI>little valiant Sea-officer,</HI> not now
in employ. He, perhaps, considering himself as at sea,
crowded himself and three cousins in with Mrs Frinsham
and myself (the pew is small for four persons); blustered so
violently, and swore in Church, and at length prevailed,
by his eloquence <HI>or</HI> his oaths, on the <HI>respectable</HI> Vestry
(after all the gentlemen were retired), to write me a very
curious letter indeed (it is carefully preserved by Mrs.
Frinsham amongst her <HI>odd</HI> curiosities), forbidding me to sit
in the seat any more, <HI>they</HI> having given it to Captain BLUS∣TER,
and his uncle the Coal-dealer, who are much <HI>too
genteel</HI> ever to go to Church in an afternoon, or on week∣days.
I was beginning to fear we must attend Divine Ser∣vice
as used to do the excellent Mrs. Yorke of Pirton, my
mother's aunt, who, for some years before her death, being
a cripple by the gout, was constantly lifted in and out of
her coach to take the air, or make a visit, but could not
drive into the Church; she was therefore regularly carried
to Church twice every Sunday, and every Saint's day,
Wednesdays, and Fridays, in her sedan-chair, placed in the
aile, and the poles drawn out, not to incommode persons
<PB N="dxcix" REF="613"/>
passing to their pews; but, having at present no sedan∣chair,
it occurred to me, that, unless the amiable Prelate
of this Diocese was wonderfully altered for the worse in a
few years, he would be happy to assist an old friend. I
accordingly wrote to him, stating our hard case. His
Lordship honoured me with a very polite answer, inclosing
one to the Churchwardens of Chertsey, recommending it
to them to provide me with a pew; which they immediately
did, near the little Captain's, where we hear him talk, but
not <HI>now</HI> swear and curse.—So much fore cclesiastical matters;
only remarking, that the title bestowed on the Curate of
Chertsey, as Mr. White told us, is the <HI>Journeyman</HI> Parson.
I have often heard my Mother and Archdeacon Dodwell's
mother say, that the Clerk of Shottesbrook, a master shoe∣maker,
used to roar out, in the Psalm, I am a <HI>journeyman,</HI>
as all my Fathers were; and Mr. Cherry's comment was,
<Q REND="inline">"Frith always struts when he hollows it out, feeling his <HI>own</HI>
superiority over David, who, he conceives, never attained
to being a <HI>master</HI> workman."</Q> We never hear an oath, or
see, or hear, a drunken person, man or woman, in the
street.</P>
<P>Mr. Whitaker told Mrs. Frinsham and Mrs. Berkeley,
that the reformation in the manners of the <HI>lower</HI> class of
people in this place, within these last eight years, since Mr.
White was curate of the place, is quite astonishing to all
the neighbourhood. The higher and middling ranks of
<PB N="dc" REF="614"/>
people, in most places, are too <HI>wise</HI> and too <HI>genteel</HI> to be
<HI>anxious</HI> about the salvation of their immortal souls!!!</P>
<P>Perhaps a few weeks spent at Dover by the great
boys and girls, and some of their parents, might suggest to
them, that it would be better to walk next the kennel,
and <Q REND="inline">"leave the wall to elder persons;"</Q> as the very wor∣thy
Mrs. Neal, of the tea-warehouse at Dover, taught her
wonderfully civil, clever, little girl, of eight years old,
who, shewing slipped behind, to give me the wall at every
turning.</P>
<P>Enquiring the way once of a sensible-looking little
charity-school girl, she said, <Q REND="inline">"I will wait upon you, Ma∣dam,
and shew it you."</Q> She received, as she merited,
my kind thanks. We set out;—she turned back to the
little girls that she had quitted, slipped off her pattens,
saying, <Q REND="inline">"Pray take care of them; I shall walk quicker
without them, and not hinder the Lady."</Q> It was impos∣sible
for the Lady, who ever delighted to pay attention to
real humble merit in humble station, and try to benefit
the possessors, to avoid rewarding her little conductress,
and enquiring who she was. She did not reply, as washer∣women's,
&amp;c. children in these equalizing days generally
do, <Q REND="inline">"I am <HI>Mrs. Draggletail's</HI> daughter."</Q> She replied,
<Q REND="inline">"My name is Susan Ellendor, Madam. My mother is a
<PB N="dci" REF="615"/>
widow, and keeps a publick house;"</Q> I think, the Flying
Horse. This being the last time I was at Dover, I have
not learned, but hope, that the sensible, civil little Susan
is now a worthy servant in the family of some gentleman
who has a worthy lady, who takes a <HI>little</HI> care of the souls
of her servants, as, I trust, will all the friends to whom I
address this farewell epistle.</P>

<HEAD>THE EDITOR'S APOLOGY,</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For the Errors of herself and the Devil; i.e. the Printer's
Devil.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>THE learned acute Dr. Young says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Flaw in the best—The
many flaw all o'er.</HI>"</Q> To which party the Editor belongs
has been by this time pronounced: by many, perhaps, as in
most other cases (where sentence is pronounced without
seeing the <HI>whole</HI> of the evidence), the judgement <HI>may</HI> be
wrong. She conceives, as in most other things, fortune,
station, &amp;c. &amp;c. she is in the <HI>middle</HI> way. That she <HI>ap∣pears</HI>
sometimes to have written <HI>superlative</HI> nonsense is most
certain, for which she is <HI>not</HI> famous. <Q REND="inline">"But this sentence
is absolute nonsense,"</Q> says a Reader; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>no one can</HI> make
<HI>head or tail of it.</HI>"</Q> Agreed, good Reader: yet the Editor
<HI>did not write</HI> it nonsense; but her once good hand, now,
when writing in haste, degenerated into a very small scrawl,
must have often puzzled even the <HI>poor</HI> Devil, or the Compo∣sitor.
A witty clerk of an uncle of hers, a very eminent
Barrister, used to say, <Q REND="inline">"My master writes <HI>three</HI> hands; one
that <HI>I</HI> can't read, one that he can't read <HI>himself,</HI> and one
that the <HI>Devil</HI> can't read."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dciii" REF="617"/>
The Editor, from an ugly trick contracted in very early
youth, always speaks in a very low voice what she is writing;
and, although her pen moves very quick, yet, the little <HI>red∣rag,</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"the unruly member,"</Q> moves <HI>still</HI> quicker; by which
means she frequently leaves out three or four words in a
sentence, which she is obliged to interline. She never whilst
writing tittles the third vowel, crosses her <HI>t,</HI> or makes any
stop but at the beginning of a new paragraph. All this is left
<HI>to be done</HI> after the letter, &amp;c. is finished; and, like most other
things postponed, is frequently <HI>not done at all;</HI> which, to
those unacquainted with her horridly heedless manner of
writing, makes her letters <HI>very</HI> valuable Etruscan MSS.</P>
<P>The Editor thinks she may now proceed, without be∣ing
guilty of <HI>injustice,</HI> to <HI>accuse</HI> the Devil. Whenever the
Editor has had occasion to use the word <HI>perpetually,</HI> the
<HI>Devil</HI> knows, or perhaps <HI>does not</HI> know why, the word (as
lately in an article in the Gentleman's Magazine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Tale of Woe, in the Magazine for August 1796.</NOTE>) is con∣stantly
printed PERSONALLY; which makes it in some in∣stances
<HI>very extraordinary</HI> nonsense indeed.</P>
<P>In some places the note is introduced into the text, and
the poor text <HI>cast down</HI> into the note; as it is at the bottom
of p. cccc; where the last three lines are superfluous, but
were intended to have accompanied the little anecdote of
poor unhappy Lady Vane, in p. ccccvii.</P>

Mentioning a very beautiful little painting of Cheltenham
Church, taken from the Well, by Miss Hamilton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the elegant, throughly amiable daughters of Lord Archibald Hamilton, during the Editor's melancholy <HI>séjour</HI> at Cheltenham, during the last direful illness of her son, and the tremendously alarming illness of dear Dr. Berkeley, at Cheltenham. These angelic-hearted young ladies insisted on regu∣larly escorting the Editor from the Spa to her own door every morning, as she regularly drank the water (and would do it every year, for two months, in au∣tumn, if she could afford the journey). The Editor has above mentioned <HI>her objection</HI> to taking a footman, to attend her in a morning. She has for some years been receiving severe reprimands from her <HI>dear</HI> TRIO, Father, Son, and Sister, for DARING to walk, except in her garden, alone, lest she should, half, more than half blind, run her simple <HI>head</HI> against a horse's <HI>tail,</HI> as she once did. The Poor Editor used to plead, <Q REND="inline">"that she never was <HI>so</HI> watched in youth by her mother; why <HI>submit</HI> to it in her old age by her son? Yet so it kindly was, still kindly is. To be followed by her very worthy careful servant in <HI>London,</HI> she has no objection; <HI>but</HI> to see a female followed by a footman at <HI>Chertsey,</HI> would make it supposed an OATLANDS lady was in town."</Q></NOTE>, at
the request of the Editor, and which hangs constantly within

Miss M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>; the <HI>poor</HI> Devil has turned the word <HI>beau∣tiful</HI>
into a <HI>handsome</HI> drawing; which raises the idea of vul∣garity
in her mind—perhaps, as a Berkeshire woman, having
in early youth heard the lower people of that beautiful
county ridiculed for frequently saying, <Q REND="inline">"A <HI>handsome-bodied
man,</HI> or woman, as you shall see, Sir!"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="dcv" REF="619"/>
The Editor fears that most of the errors of the press must go
uncorrected; as although, thanks to the mercy of God, she
has still eye-sight sufficient to scrawl by day-light, and read
a sensible, clever book by candle-light, she cannot <HI>six</HI> her
eye, by <HI>any</HI> light, to count lines, and find out in <HI>which</HI> the
error lies, without injuring her eyes very much. The
casting up her <HI>(now)</HI> very small weekly book of accompts
strains her eyes, more than reading or writing five hours <HI>de
suite,</HI> when she has not occasion to fix them.</P>
<P>The Editor has been from very early youth, by her
nearest, her dearest surviving friend, told, <Q REND="inline">"That she is of
a temper <HI>too</HI> sanguine—that she <HI>never</HI> ceases to hope, in
despite of disappointment repeated, and <HI>re-repeated.</HI>"</Q>
The Editor has ever found it pleasanter than to go quietly
into the Castle of GIANT DESPAIR, (vide Pilgrim's Progress,
the delight of her very early childhood—the new edition of

very liberal-minded Mr. Burder, Dissenting Minister at Co∣ventry,

The Editor one day in the shop of an old huckster at St.
Andrew's, she is sorry to say that he was an <HI>Episcopal</HI> of the
name of Noarey, a young gentleman of very remarkable,
gentle, sweet manners, as before remarked; the young
Laird of Logie Almon entered the shop. Seeing the old
wretch engaged in serving either the Editor or her Sister,
he politely forbore to ask for the article he wanted. The
old wretch thus addressed him (his hat cocked like a
Kevenhuller, bolt upright, in a parallel line with his surly
shoulders): <Q REND="inline">"Well, young man; why do you stand there?
What is that you <HI>wants?</HI> Why doan't you tell, instead

don't know what Logie Almon wants, as his politeness
to the Ladies in your shop prevents his telling whilst you
are serving them; but I can tell you what you want;
and, if this young gentleman and you were at Eton, what

the kennel."</Q> The old Hottentot <HI>growled,</HI> and Mrs.
Frinsham and the young Laird laughed very much.</P>
<P>The Editor, whilst in Scotland, used frequently to afford
great diversion to dear Dr. Berkeley, her Sister, and Son.
The latter used to divert their friends in England with his
Mother's <HI>labours and troubles,</HI> about spinning, and weaving
table-cloths, napkins, &amp;c. saying, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>My Mother</HI> really
turned herself into a very gewd <HI>Scotch weef,</HI> counting her
spinning when come home, measuring, marking for
bleaching, just as if she had been <HI>booarn a Scot.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley, going one day to purchase some fine Dutch
flax, the man was wonderfully surly and saucy; Mrs. Frin∣sham
said, <Q REND="inline">"You are the rudest being I ever saw in my
life. Were I the Lady, I would go without flax till
the <HI>resurrection</HI> sooner than purchase it of such a <HI>wretch</HI>

Mrs. Frinsham said, <Q REND="inline">"You are a brute then;"</Q> and walked
out into the street, saying, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Sister, come away."</Q>
Mrs. Berkeley, however, stayed, and purchased her flax, as
it was the best in the city. He had a lad, about four∣teen,
the civilest gentle creature one could see; his name
forgotten. He lived in North Street, and was a true dis∣ciple

hangs in her dressing-room: but, in frequent removals, she
has lost the pleasing Elegy; or perhaps has lent it, and it
has never been returned, a too common case with the

<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mr. Bower pressed you so re∣peatedly

<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Mother, my Lord and

Eton it fell to <HI>my</HI> lot to give his Lordship a sound drubbing;

it; and we were ever after very good, although not par∣ticularly

how is that possible?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Stay till you see, my Lord, whether I am a

<P>Away flew Mr. Berkeley, with his wonted alacrity to
serve a friend, or a strange, or even a foe, if he thought
them worthy; and returned, escorting his tenderly beloved,
his sincerely respected friend, the late amiable Lord Lou∣don,
whose delight in Mr. Berkeley's sweet society, consi∣dering
the disparity of their years, was wonderful.</P>
<P>Some of Mr. Berkeley's friends in Edinburgh used
laughingly to tell him, <Q REND="inline">"that, although <HI>he</HI> might never be a
Peer <HI>himself,</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> if he had one, might; for that cer∣tainly
if he, like the great Earl of Cork, would wait ten
years, he must infallibly marry Lady Flora Campbell,
the present Countess of Loudon."</Q></P>
<P>The sweet Countess of Loudon, then about five years
old, would nestle and crowd. On being asked, <Q REND="inline">"What
she wanted?"</Q> she used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Why to sit on Mr.
<PB N="dcxvi" REF="630"/>
Berkeley's knee, if he can take me up, or else to stand
by him."</Q> Her Ladyship was not singular; all children,
quite strangers, constantly made up to Mr. Berkeley, his
father, and his grandmother Mrs. Frinsham; and little
ones in arms, the Editor has frequently seen struggle, and
even cry, to go to Dr. Berkeley and to her Mother. But
one child in the world ever paid the Editor that compliment,
excepting her own babes. Mrs. Berkeley does not love
little children. She should esteem her <HI>nature</HI> more if she
did. She <HI>pities</HI> the poor little pewling disagreeable animals.
A kitten can divert one; but the <HI>untaught</HI> offspring of the
Lord of the creation cannot. So much for the DIGNITY
of FALLEN Human Nature!</P>
<P>An odd accident happened not long after Mr. Monck
Berkeley's return to England. The very amiable Mr.
Gipps, M.P. for Canterbury, ever ready to oblige and
serve his friends, permitted Mr. Monck Berkeley to have
his letters from his Scottish friends addressed under cover
to him.</P>
<P>One day, when the Editor was dressing for dinner, she
heard a visiting-rap with the utmost <HI>sang-froide,</HI> very certain
that Mr. Wrightson would not let any one into her apart∣ment
<HI>in the morning.</HI> Presently open flew the dressing-room
door; and in flew Mrs. Gipps, out of breath, saying, <Q REND="inline">"I
beg your pardon for <HI>forcing</HI> my way in to you; but I hear
<PB N="dcxvii" REF="631"/>
that Mr. Berkeley, with whom is <HI>my</HI> business, is gone to
dinner in the country, so I must entreat you to make my
apology to him. When I went up to dress, I saw a letter
lie on my table, the seal upwards. Never minding that it
was a coronet, I <HI>scratched</HI> it open. The folding of it hid
the words, 'My dear friend,' and 'Edinburgh,' and the
date. I began, and redde about half way down the first
side. When I came to these words, 'I am most happy
that I have it in my power to gratify myself by imme∣diately
complying with your request; and I can with
truth say, that, were all my Chaplainships now vacant,
my dear friend Mr. Berkeley"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Here,"</Q> added my
very sensible, very obliging neighbour, <Q REND="inline">"I stood aghast,
turned the letter, and saw on the back, 'To George-Monck
Berkeley, Esquire.' I was ready to faint at what
Mr. Berkeley <HI>must</HI> think of me."</Q> The Editor here an∣swered
for her Son, that the only sensation it would occa∣sion
to him, would be that it had caused a moment's dis∣tress
to Mrs. Gipps, who proceeded to assure Mrs. Berkeley,
<Q REND="inline">"that she had not redde a tittle after she came to the name
Berkeley;"</Q> of which Mrs. Berkeley was fully convinced.
Whilst Mrs. Gipps was accusing herself of being a great
fool; which no one else could ever do, she being blessed
with an exceeding strong understanding, which descends to
her two fine little boys, blessed, the Editor believes, with
the best mother-in-law in the three kingdoms; Mrs.
<PB N="dcxviii" REF="632"/>
Berkeley prevailed on her good neighbour to stay and pin
on her gown; which, having begun to undress, was literally
only fastened by one pin, such was her haste to exculpate
herself from what very few would have suspected her of.
It afforded a pleasant laugh at the next Canterbury rout.</P>
<P>The distressing letter was locked up, unredde, until Mr.
Monck Berkeley's return at night, when he proceeded to
read—after <Q REND="inline">"were all my chaplainships now vacant—my
dear friend Mr. Berkeley should fill them every one as
he pleased."</Q> There followed some polite obliging enco∣miums
on Mr. Monck Berkeley's worth, wisdom, and good
judgement. The very elegant young gentleman mentioned

very worthy and Reverend H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, was just
then gone into orders, and wishing for that elegant orna∣ment

wear it, as many SPRIGS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boys of twenty-two and a half are <HI>generally</HI> by the Editor styled SPRIGS.

Mrs. Cherry amiably took out her knife, cut off a good large sprig with an orange as large as a small wallnut and several blossoms on it; then took a cauking-pin out of her pincushion, and pinned it on her frock on the left side. The Editor still feels the pleasure her poor little simple heart felt; no elegant finery since has <HI>so</HI> delighted it as when the <HI>orange-spring</HI> was placed near it. It is, surely, wise to gratify children (who must <HI>una∣voidably be</HI> so <HI>often,</HI> if <HI>wisely</HI> educated, contradicted) in any <HI>little innocent grati∣fication.</HI> The Editor recollects with pleasure the extacy of joy she once oc∣casioned her beloved son to experience during what she always calls the <HI>rabbiting</HI> age with boys. Happily girls have it not; but there is a time when ALL the boys she has ever known are <HI>rabbit-wild, wild</HI> with nursing and rearing rabbits for the cats to eat, as so <HI>nursed,</HI> their flesh is <HI>too strong</HI> for a beggar to eat. Mr. Monck Berkeley flew into the room, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Madam! if you <HI>will not give,</HI> or <HI>lend me</HI> THREE shillings, I shall break my heart.

Lord Mon∣boddo has proved, in his second volume of <HI>Antient Metaphysics,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that dogs can remember, can reason, can reflect; but that they have not conscious∣ness,"</Q> i.e. they have a soul as well as Man, sometimes a wiser soul; but they have not a spark breathed into Man, the BREATH of JEHOVAH. <Q REND="inline">"Let us make Man,"</Q> &amp;c.

It has been often asserted, that NO young lady, brought up by Mrs. Sheeles and the pious sensible Mrs. Gambier, ever lost their character, excepting a wretched little girl, who, long before she attained the age of fourteen, was one Christmas holydays, after she had been about a year in Queen's Square, SOLD by her vile Guardian to a vile <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>shire 'Squire, whose mother ill-using the poor VERY <HI>weak</HI> girl, contemporary with the Editor, she ran away from him. The poor creature, as many others have done, experienced the truth of the wise Spanish Proverb, <Q REND="inline">"bien et casada que tien ni Sugero ni Canada."</Q> Mrs. Sheeles sadly lamented to Mrs. Berkeley, about thirty years ago, that she suffered herself to be persuaded by Lady <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> to take her daughters. No two Earls daughters in England have exceeded these two <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> ladies in a variety of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> matches. Mrs. Sheeles was a most accomplished woman, of very good family, grand-daughter of the excellent Sir John Smith, cousin-german to the late <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Lord Montford. It always rejoices Mrs. Berkeley to hear of the happiness and prosperity of her grand-children.</NOTE> Sheeles's twenty different sets of company came, Mrs. then Miss Anne Frinsham was certain to exhibit to every different company. Her ear for music was so exquisitely accurate, that the Editor has frequently, in her youth, and a very little before her lamented death, heard her say, that, when at school, (always in mischief,) like, and perpetually with, her dearly beloved friend, the wonderfully sensible, highly cultivated, accomplished Mrs. A. Langley, of the Manor-house, York, she has repeatedly <HI>tried</HI> to dance out of time, but never could do it more than two steps, the third was not in her power. It used to be said by the governesses, teachers, &amp;c. <Q REND="inline">"The eldest Miss Frinsham looks as if she would fly over the moon, the youngest as if butter would not melt in her mouth; yet Miss Frinsham is never in mischief, Miss Anne never out of it."</Q> It was innocent mischief, although it subjected the two Miss Annes frequently to have recourse to their Common Prayer Book to learn a Psalm, sometimes to their Bible to learn a chapter by heart, esteemed a pretty weighty, although not a disgraceful, punishment, like the Fool's-cap or the Red-tongue. Schools well conducted are excellent places for children of both sexes surely. Mrs. Frinsham used through life to laugh, and tell Dr. and Mr. Monck Berkeley, when the Editor used to say, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>as a girl she</HI> found no pleasure in <HI>their escampades</HI> to the parlour door at night,"</Q> &amp;c. <Q REND="inline">"Aye, she was a <HI>poor, pusillanimous, stupid, little puss.</HI> She would never get up after she was in bed, never slip out of the school-room.

be <HI>praising,</HI> rather than supplicating that Saviour-God
whom she had laboured so faithfully to serve for very many
years.</P>
<P>Although her outward sufferings were very heavy, all
was bright within. No self-reproach for <HI>broken</HI> SABBATHS,
for neglect of public worship on WEEK DAYS, one grand
cause of the decay of Christian piety in this Nation, which
the Editor, doomed, alas! to attend dying beds, has twice
witnessed, to her great distress, not, blessed be God, either

her Mother, Son, or Husband! Her sole anxiety was on
account of her poor, now, alas! throughly forlorn, deso∣late,
<HI>trebly</HI>-widowed Sister, left to struggle alone, with
variety of perplexing businesses, without one near, dear
relative to counsel and to soothe her; yet, blessed be the
mercy of an all-gracious God, she was enabled to say to her
almost idolizing Sister, <Q REND="inline">"Dearest of friends, I am not
ALONE; for God is with me, <HI>will</HI> be with me. I have
been constantly, as you know, praying to him from the
age of seventeen, '<HI>Cast me not away in the time of age,
when my strength faileth, when I am grey-headed.</HI>' And he
has graciously promised ALL his <HI>real</HI> children, '<HI>I</HI> will
NEVER leave thee, nor <HI>forsake</HI> thee.' And I may adapt
the language of Holy David, and instead of saying,
'When my Father and my Mother forsake me, the
LORD taketh me up.' But, when it pleases HIS wisdom
to chastize his poor sinful child, by taking from her her
idolized Son, her tenderly beloved Husband, her darling
Sister; HE <HI>will</HI> take her up, and conduct her safely,
she wishes she might presume to say shortly, to the
realms of bliss, there to rejoin those lovely spirits,
her dear happy TRIO, to part no more."</Q> The
lovely Saint was <HI>exceedingly</HI> consoled to find that the
Giver of every good gift had, in the midst of <HI>such
anguish</HI> of soul, vouchsafed such a measure of his <HI>best
gift,</HI> FAITH. Mrs. Frinsham entreated her Sister to
<PB N="dcxxviii" REF="642"/>
remember, what Mrs. Berkeley always admired in Brooke's
Fool of Quality, that <Q REND="inline">"GRIEF hath not a more <HI>deadly</HI> FOE
than <HI>business;</HI> that she, alas! had much, to which she
entreated her to apply herself instead of mourning over
her loss."</Q> We all, in turn, feel that it is easier to preach
than to practise; and the Editor feels the force of Our
Blessed Master's words, <Q REND="inline">"Work whilst you have the day,
for the night cometh wherein no man can work."</Q> The
Editor has laboured to work a little in the day, the time of
youth, of vigour; for the night is come (rather early) upon
her, when she finds, by melancholy experience, that she
can do but <HI>very</HI> little—May that little all redound to the
glory of GOD <HI>her</HI> SAVIOUR, <HI>Amen.</HI> Lord JESUS! say
AMEN.</P>
<P>The Editor has several stone weight of papers to inspect
of Bishop Berkeley's—his journal when in Italy, &amp;c. &amp;c. of
Mr. Cherry's; of Archbishop Secker's; Miss Talbot's; Mr.
Monck Berkeley's: and dear Dr. Berkeley wished her, at
her leisure, to overlook and select from his numerous ser∣mons
(enough to make a dozen volumes), one volume to be
published: about six sermons Dr. Berkeley got transcribed,
during his last illness, to be printed, which, together with
his four sermons printed during his life, will nearly make
the volume.</P>
<P><PB N="dcxxix" REF="643"/>
The Editor feels some consolation in knowing that from
very early youth one of her chief studies and greatest delights
was labouring to oblige, please, and render happy, her
ever from <HI>infancy</HI> tenderly beloved sister; and that the
sisters never, through life, had a quarrel with each other,
since the age, when, if there arose any dispute whose DOLL
was <HI>best</HI> dressed, their wise mother used to call out, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!
if there is any quarrel <HI>I</HI> am coming to make a <HI>third.</HI>"</Q>
which always <HI>instantly</HI> ended the dispute.</P>
<P>The Editor is perpetually, since her <HI>last</HI> lamentable loss,
involuntarily recurring to those beautiful lines of the elo∣quent
Dr. Young, in his first Night:<Q><L>DEATH! great proprietor of all!</L>
<L>* * * * * * * * * * *</L>
<L>* * * * * * * * * * *</L>
<L>* * * * * * * * * * *</L>
<L>Amid such mighty plunder, why exhaust</L>

<L>Insatiate Archer! could not <HI>one</HI> suffice?</L>
<L>Thy shaft flew <HI>thrice;</HI> and <HI>thrice</HI> my peace was slain.</L></Q></P>
<P>But then the Editor banishes those <HI>half</HI>-murmuring lines
of the finest of Poets, by repeating the devout prose of
<PB N="dcxxx" REF="644"/>
Dean Hickes's "Reformed Devotions," (the Preparatory
Office for Death, used by the Editor from her youth up,
on the THURSDAY, instead of the Office for that day,)

from abroad, wrote five lines to his Mother, and retired to rest. On rising
to eat his din∣ner at a miserable inn, he asked,

<Q REND="inline">"A gentleman had gone away, and left a play-book be∣hind

left to take care of itself until he had finished that charming piece. He
un∣locked his writing-box, wrote the following lines, sealed and sent them
off by post, then ate his dinner. Mr. B. sometimes said, when shewing
them to his friends,
<Q REND="inline">"I do not suppose that Mr. Greathead ever knew from whom
he received them."</Q> A lady of very high rank and very cultivated mind once
asked Mr. B.'s Mother

<HI>wonderful powers</HI> of Mr. Peter's <HI>pencil</HI> would be a vain
attempt. Perhaps it may be equally vain to attempt doing justice to the
exquisite amiability of that worthy gentleman's heart, and the very refined
elegance of his manners. He was most sincerely beloved, and respected, by
Mr. Monke Berkeley, who, in a letter introducing Mr. P. to his father, Dr. B.
says, Pope has given his <HI>true</HI> character in few words:
<Q REND="inline">"The noblest work of God."</Q> Mr. P. painted a picture of
his friend, which was by Mr. B. presented to his mother. It is, by some of
the best judges of painting, supposed to be the finest portrait ever
produced by any pencil, ancient or modern. It preserves that wonderful depth
of thought, and that exquisite benevolence which so strongly animated the
countenance of Mr. M. B. The letter to Mrs. B. which accompanied the picture,
proves that Mr. Peters wields his pen almost as ably as he does his
pencil.</NOTE></HEAD>

<Q REND="inline">"He had just met with a little poem that he thought she
would like to hear, if at leisure."</Q> He took his seat, and read as far
as to the five last lines; then ceased, and asked how she liked it.
Mrs. B. replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Like it; my dear child! why the man was a great villain, and
the poor girl a great fool. Who wrote it?"</Q> Mr. B. replied,
<Q REND="inline">"It is not quite finished."</Q> He then read the five last
lines, when Mrs. B. not guessing her son to be the writer, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"The moral is delightful, and makes it <HI>all</HI> beautiful;
tell me, if you know, who wrote it."</Q> He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"An Eton boy;"</Q> adding, in his sweetly musical voice,

<HEAD>THE RAPE OF THE WIG.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1782.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to prefix this short account to the following <HI>jeu
d'esprit</HI> of Mr. B. then about eighteen. Some of the students
used to say, that if Newbourn would wear a better wig his lec∣tures
would make a deeper impression on them, and talked of
burning the vile caxon. One day the young gentleman since
known at Bath by the name of Count E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, an early friend of
Mr. B's at Eton school, visiting an English gentleman who
boarded at Mr. Cook's, snatched it off the peg in the <HI>trance,</HI> i.e.
the hall, where it hung; when he got into the street, he told
his friend that he had got it, and was taking it home to burn it.
Mr. B. who ever from a youth hated <HI>mischievous</HI> mischief,
much as he <HI>ever</HI> loved innocent mischief, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! no;
do not burn it."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"What can I do then?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why let your
servant, or mine, who will, do it.—Better dress it nicely, fill it
with powder and pomatum, and give it a new ribband."</Q> It
was a tail wig. This was agreed on. Some of the gentlemen
suggested, that in the box in which it was returned, an apology
for the <HI>theft</HI> ought to be made; and Mr. B. being ever a ready
pen-man, was told he must write the card. He took up his pen
with his usual alertness, and wrote the following lines. It was
some weeks before the Author was known in the University.</P>

IT is hoped, that the excellent Writer of the following
<HI>Jeu d'Esprit</HI> will pardon his old, his throughly grateful
Friend for publishing it without his knowledge or consent.
That it is the first offence of the kind, cannot be pleaded
in excuse. The former offence was pardoned; the work
was of a very different kind, an excellent little tract for the
children of the Sunday Schools near his own estate. There
being no title-page, the Writer of this introduction prefixed
one, <Q REND="inline">"Written by Henry Grimston, Esquire;"</Q> of whom it
may, with strictest truth, be asserted, that he is<Q><L>"Of manners gentle, of affections mild,</L>
<L>"In wit a man, simplicity a child."</L></Q></P>
<P>To attempt an elaborate character of Mr. Grimston,
would be too weighty a task; it may be learned from every
distressed man, woman, or child, in his own neighbourhood
Suffice it to say, that the Editor esteems it a real hap∣piness
<PB N="154" REF="796"/>
to have lived in the strictest friendship with Mr.
Grimston for the last fifteen years, often, for many months
together, under the same roof; and never observed, or
even heard, that he had the shadow of any vice; but firmly
believes that he is blessed with every virtue. He was the
chosen, the beloved, the respected, the bosom friend of the
amiable hearted George-Monck Berkeley, Esquire. His <HI>un∣wearied
attentions</HI> to Mr. Berkeley, during the two last years
of his painful journey through this vale of misery to the realms
of bliss, prove the soundness of Mr. Berkeley's judgement,
when, at the age of about twenty, he said to his Mother,
<Q REND="inline">"I have, I thank God, many friends that I <HI>love,</HI> and <HI>some</HI>
that I <HI>respect,</HI> but the man I fix on for my fast friend through
life is Grimston."</Q> Mr. Grimston is the grandson, and in
some sort the <HI>eleve</HI> of (as his lovely mother died, to<Q>"give him orphan'd in his birth,"</Q>
as speaks the eloquent Dr. Young in the Night Thoughts)
the excellently wise and throughly pious Lady Le Gard,
mother of the late Sir Digby Le Gard.</P>

Mr. Berkeley said, the dog shewed the superiority of his sense above English dogs.

<HEAD>AN ELEGY</HEAD>
<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF MASTER GEORGE-ROBERT BERKELEY, SECOND SON OF THE REV. DR.
BERKELEY, PREBENDARY OF CANTERBURY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who died April
15, 1775, aged eight years, four months, and four days, after only one week's
illness, of a dreadful putrid fever, then raging in Canterbury; as did one of
his beloved school-fellows, that lovely child, Mas∣ter Tatton, only son
of the Reverend Dr. Tatton, Prebendary of Canterbury, and grandson of the
charitable, bountiful Dean Lynch. No art could pre∣vent this sweet child from
calling three or four times in the day to know how his friend did. Master
Robert Berkeley sickened on one Saturday, and died the next. Master Tatton
was going to take a ride, it being holyday. When got as far as Burghgate, the
<HI>dismal</HI> sound of the <HI>great</HI> bell assailed his ear; he
dropped his bridle, and said to the servant attending him,
<Q REND="inline">"Ah! <HI>my dear</HI> Robert is dead, and my ride is
spoiled."</Q> He turned his horse, went home, fickened that very evening,
and died the next Saturday. These little crea∣tures were lovely and
pleasant in their lives, and in their deaths were not di∣vided. The elegant
<HI>application</HI> of this text is borrowed from a most charm∣ing letter of
the highly cultivated Mrs. Cox, of St. Giles, Oxford, to Mrs. George Berkeley,
thanking her for Dr. Berkeley's long-smothered sermon, preached at Lambeth
Palace, at the consecration of his beloved old friend, the angelic Bishop
Horne; (see p. 159.) Dr. Berkeley did not long survive his beloved Friend.

<L>"O may I ever, like the Saints above,</L>
<L>"Adore my Maker with seraphic love<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reading
one day to his Mother, the subject led him to enquire, what was the
difference between a Cherub and a Seraph? He was told, that it was supposed
by Divines, that Seraphs loved God most, but that Cherubs knew more of God
and of his adorable nature. He paused near a minute, and ap∣peared to be in
deep thought: then looking on his Mother, he said,
<Q REND="inline">"Mam∣ma, Mamma, pray listen to me: I do desire to be a
Seraph, that I may love God a great deal, rather than be a Cherub, and have a
vast deal of knowledge."</Q> This was remarkable, as he had a very uncommon
thirst for knowledge. The above choice was made just a month before his
death, when in good health, in high gay spirits, being just come in from
playing with some of his school-fellows.</NOTE>!</L>
<L><PB N="166" REF="808"/> "I ask not earthly treasures to obtain:</L>
<L>"Be poverty my lot, if Christ's my gain<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>When he was but seven years old, reading that part of the Gospel, where our blessed Saviour says, <Q REND="inline">"How hardly shall they that are rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven!"</Q> he started, dropped the Bible on the table, and said: <Q REND="inline">"What, can NO rich people go to Heaven?"</Q> Being desired to proceed, and see what would follow, he redde, <Q REND="inline">"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king∣dom of Heaven."</Q> He added, <Q REND="inline">"Then, I am sure, it is impossible."</Q> On be∣ing told, that Christ says, how hard it is for those, who trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; and that riches are apt to draw off the heart from God, although that is not always the case; he laid down his book, considered some time in silence, then addressed his Mo∣ther as before, <Q REND="inline">"Mamma, Mamma, pray listen to me!"</Q> and said, <Q REND="inline">"I do desire to be poor, and to go to Christ, rather than to be very rich, and live without him."</Q> He naturally loved money exceedingly, and never parted with it willingly, but to the poor. He would frequently borrow of the servants to relieve them, if his allowance was all spent. His Father and Aunt used to amuse themselves with borrowing six pence of him, and then pretending they could not pay it, that they might witness his <HI>extreme</HI> anxiety not to lose it. He would say, <Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma <HI>tells me,</HI> that <HI>no</HI> honest peo∣ple <HI>ever</HI> borrow money without paying it again as soon <HI>as possible;</HI> and that it is <HI>very wicked to run in debt.</HI>"</Q> He would then repair to his Mother, la∣ment his hard fate, and ask if he could not <HI>make</HI> them pay him. What a contrast to his generous Brother! Yet both were delightfully amiable children in their different ways. It is supposed, that Bishop Berkeley was <HI>naturally</HI> a lover of money. An Irish nobleman, an intimate friend of the Bishop's, often mentioned to the Editor, that, on his <HI>urging</HI> Bishop Berkeley to accept the primacy offered to him by Lord Chesterfield, the Bishop replied, <Q REND="inline">"No, my dear Lord, I very early in life got the love of money here," (lifting up his leg, and setting it down with such force, that it shook his library, and every thing in it;) "and here, by the grace of God, I will <HI>always</HI> keep it."</Q> This was uttered in the most energetic tone of voice. A younger brother of Dr. Berkeley's, who died at about seventeen, had the same spirit as his little nephew. The Bishop early gave his sons a large allowance for cloaths, &amp;c. A collection was making for a distressed Baronet. The Bishop called on his sons to contribute. Dr. Berkeley flew to his room, and brought down twenty guineas. The Bishop said, <Q REND="inline">"Willy, where is yours?"</Q></P>
<P>William.—<Q REND="inline">"Presently, my Lord."</Q></P>
<P>Bp. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Willy, I wait for your money."</Q></P>
<P>William.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, my Lord, immediately."</Q></P>
<P>He went off slowly to his room, and brought down <HI>fifteen</HI> guineas, say∣ing, <Q REND="inline">"There it is."</Q> But added, smiling, <Q REND="inline">"It is <HI>really my heart's blood;</HI> but <HI>I know</HI> it is <HI>right</HI> to give to the poor."</Q></P></NOTE>!"</L>
<L><PB N="167" REF="809"/> Thus spoke the loveliest child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was universally allowed to be very remarkably handsome. He
had fine large eyes, with an uncommon mixture of sense and sweetness,
and very long dark eyelashes, beautifully dark, and finely arched. He had
fine nut∣brown hair, which curled on his forehead, and round his face, and hung
in fine ringlets, below the bottom of his back; his complexion a fine
distinct red and white.</NOTE>, that e'er the sound</L>

<L>But ah! how much that dread compliance cost,</L>
<L>Say ye, who mourn a Son, a Brother lost<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He
loved his only brother, four years older than himself, so violently as is
hardly to be described. He has been often overheard by the servants of the
family, when alone with his brother, to say,
<Q REND="inline">"Brother, I will not live a moment after you, die whenever you
will. If you go to fight against the French, <HI>I will</HI> go too: if you
are shot, I will be shot the very next minute."</Q> His Brother, until near
seventeen, was languishing to go into the army, as most idle geniuses
are; the wisdom of his Father kept him out, rejecting the kind offer of a
cornetcy in the Oxford Blues, made to him by his amiable Friend the late Lord
Conyngham, who having obtained it for a near relation of his Lady, the youth
altered his mind—when dear Lord Co∣nyngham offered it to Dr. Berkeley,
whose brave Uncle, Major Burton, had married an Aunt of Dr. Berkeley's. This
connexion, and the <HI>very</HI> near neighbourhood of this amiable family,
added much to Mr. Berkeley's and his parents pleasure from his childhood
until Dr. Berkeley quitted Cookham to attend his Son to the University of St.
Andrew's. When he was not six years old, his brother was exceedingly ill, and
refusing to take a medicine, this lovely child came to him, and in an agony
of soul, <HI>not to be described,</HI> urged him to take it, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"if you will not, I must die."</Q> This had the desired

two years and a quarter old. A poor woman of the parish brought a wretched
little child to his Father's house to apply for relief: the poor creature was
covered over with a loathsome humour. He, sitting in his nurse's arms,
heard the mo∣ther tell its deplorable case: he turned to his nurse, and
said,
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, let me go and kiss it to make it well."</Q> She,
fearing her darling might suffer by his philanthrophy, said,
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No,</HI> you <HI>must</HI> not, lest you should get
any harm."</Q> He submitted, sat some minutes, then sprang from her
arms, ran across the room, and kissed each of the child's shoes,
saying,
<Q REND="inline">"There, I have kissed its shoes: I hope <HI>that</HI>
will make it well, and can do <HI>me</HI> no harm, nurse."</Q> When he was
three years and a quarter old, his nurse had a violent illness; his grief
was very great. Some months afterwards she relating to a friend how ill she
had been; he was at the other part of the nursery much taken up (as it was
supposed) with play: he left his play-things, ran to her, and with tears in
his eyes, said,
<Q REND="inline">"Pray, my dear nurse, do not talk any more about your
illness. <HI>I cannot</HI> bear to think what I felt then."</Q>.
<Q>"Ye who ere lost an angel, pity me,"</Q> Says the eloquent Young, Pity the

a Lady of her acquaintance to request Mrs. Berkeley to let Master Robert
visit her; the Lady took him thither the next afternoon, which he spent
with the good old Lady.—She desired her friend to thank Mrs. Berkeley,
and tell her, with her compliments, that, although being near an hundred years
old, she had of course seen <HI>many</HI> children, she had never,

much trou∣bled, lest he should not go to God, and cried out to the
servant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The very sensible, worthy, Mrs.
Mary Farrant, wife of Mr. Farrant, butcher and gra∣zier, at Town-Malling, Kent,
who idolized him, and never complained of him to his Mother but once during his
whole life—when it was most highly necessary to do it. Mrs.
Farrant, a neighbour's daughter, lived from her early youth many years in Dr.
Berkeley's family. She is one of the best tempered of women. Her little
charge, when very young, one night took it into his head that he would sing
two or three lines of a little song upon every step as he ascended the
stair-case. Mrs. Berkeley, happening to pass, stood still to
listen, and overheard the amiable servant say,
<Q REND="inline">"Come, Sir, come you must go up quicker, or I must call my
Mistress."</Q> To which he replied,
<Q REND="inline">"No, no, my dear Molly, I know very well you won't <HI>do
that.</HI>"</Q> On which Mrs. Berkeley presenting herself, the little man
skipped off to his room in an instant, and his Mother said,
<Q REND="inline">"Molly, how many fibs you do tell that child! for you know
that you never told a tale of him in your life, nor would if he was to torment
you from morning till night."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"No, to be sure Madam, I should not; for at last, by
threatening him with YOU, I get him to do what he should do."</Q> Mrs.
Berkeley, till within these very few years, made an annual grateful offering
to a worthy woman, who lived with her mother when SHE was six years old, for
not telling of her when she climbed the trees like a boy.</NOTE> who always
waited upon him,
<Q REND="inline">"Molly teach me to pray."</Q> She replied, with tears,
<Q REND="inline">"My angel, God will teach you to pray."</Q> He said, with
great earnestness,
<Q REND="inline">"Lord, teach my heart to pray."</Q> He had always been told,
that the prayer which <HI>reacheth</HI> to God must come <HI>from</HI> the
<HI>heart,</HI> and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray. He
always used Bishop Kenn's prayers and hymns in The Winchester Scholar.
Whenever Mrs. Berkeley was alone, her children always offered their prayers,
and repeated or sang their hymns with her. One evening, as he was repeating
the following verse in Bishop Kenn's evening hymn,
<Q><L>But though sleep o'er my frailty reigns,</L>
<L>Let it not hold me long in chains,</L>
<L>And now and then let loose my heart,</L>
<L>Till it an Hallelujah dart—</L></Q> his Mother desired him to omit it, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"Although it might suit the exalted piety of Bishop Kenn,
it was in him (little <HI>Robert</HI>) mocking God, as she did not believe he
had devotion sufficient to wish to wake in the middle of the night to
praise God."</Q> He stood about a minute silent, pen∣sive; then
replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma, I do desire to awake to praise God in the
night; so, if you please to give me leave, I will say it as I always do
when I say it to Molly Phipps,"</Q> the very worthy woman above named, who
doated on him, and he on her. His Mother rejoiced that her child ex∣celled her
in piety, she always omitting it herself. He was, perhaps, the most
ingenious and accomplished little creature any where to be seen. As his
bro∣ther was resolved not to learn to read, so he seemed resolved to
learn with∣out being taught. He would conjure his mother not to tell him, and
clap his little hand over her mouth, lest she should begin, or rather go
on speak∣ing; but, as he termed it, let him <HI>guess it out</HI>
himself, how words were to be spelt or pronounced. At the age of four and
an half he redde as well as he could have done at fourteen. He could find out
in the Calendar the lessons for the day, for Sundays, and holydays,
whilst he remained in petticoats. On <HI>week</HI> days, he sat with his
Mother in the seats appropriate to the Prebendaries' Ladies. The amiable
worthy lady of the late Dr. Caryl, both of whom doated on him, used to say,

<Q REND="inline">"It is like the idea one has of praying in Heaven, to hear
this <HI>little</HI> Cherubring this great choir when he chaunts. I really
believe he understands better what he is about than half the <HI>grown-up
people</HI> that come hither."</Q> Accident discovered to his mother the
strength of his me∣mory: her own was once pretty good, she having often
heard her mother say, that she learned the alphabet at once shewing; that
the next day she knew every letter: but Robert much excelled his mother. Mrs.
Berkeley, being a pretty good <HI>Bible scholar,</HI> used to work with her
needle, as she never put out any work of any sort or kind, whilst her
children were reading the Scriptures. In History, Geography, &amp;c. that
would not do. One day, ob∣serving little Robert going on perfectly right, and
finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room, she enquired what he was
at, looking off his book? He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Why, Mamma, you know when one has redde any thing <HI>in</HI>
the book <HI>once,</HI> one can read it <HI>without</HI> the book afterwards;
and a little while ago I redde this chapter <HI>in</HI> the book in the
servants' hall Bible; so now I can <HI>read</HI> it <HI>without</HI> the
book to you to-day."</Q> A boy, having cut off some of his fine curling
ringlets, which hung below the bottom of his back, he was very angry, and
said,
<Q REND="inline">"He would never forgive him."</Q>—His Mother assured
him,
<Q REND="inline">"He would go to hell if he did not."</Q>—He then
replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Then, I will forgive him; <HI>but I will never forget
it.</HI>"</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you must, or God will not love you."</Q>—<Q REND="inline">"Well then, if God <HI>will have</HI> me forget it, he must
MAKE me do it, for I never did forget any thing I ever heard or saw in my
whole life."</Q> When a little child, not being allowed scissors for fear
of his beautiful eyes, he with his fingers pinched out in paper, birds,
beasts, ships, flowers, &amp;c. so accurately as was astonishing; he
drew very finely; his se∣cond lesson, a cow's head, is preserved as a
prodigy of genius. He danced delightfully, and could go through all the
military exercise of the infantry, Dr. Berkeley always paid a serjeant for
attending his Sons. He spoke French as fluently as he did English. He, as
well as his Brother, repeated by heart, and acted delightfully. He chaunted and
sang finely. His beloved school-fellows were, lovely little Tatton, the
present sensible, worthy, Samuel Saw-bridge, esq. of Ollantigh, and the
learned Dr. Herbert Packe, son of the celebrated Dr. Packe, of Canterbury.
The Saturday on which he sickened in the evening, he flew up at twelve
o'clock, to conjure his Mother, to give him permission to invite
<Q REND="inline">"my dear Sam to dinner to-day."</Q> It was, alas! the last
dinner he ever ate; he sickened about eight in the evening. Here follows a
proof of this gentleman's honesty in very early youth. <HI>Some</HI> of the
Upper School Boys had a <HI>shameful</HI> trick of <HI>robbing</HI> the very
worthy Mrs. Longley, in the church-yard, of <HI>a dozen</HI> oranges when they
<HI>purchased half a dozen.</HI> It was necessary to have one little boy
as an assistant to this ho∣nourable action. Samuel Sawbridge was enticed;
to which he sensibly, nobly replied,
<Q REND="inline">"What! take Mrs. Longley's oranges <HI>without paying</HI> for
them! Miss Tucker teaches me my Catechism; and that says, "THOU SHALT NOT
STEAL;" and <HI>she</HI> tells me, "that taking any thing from any body,
without paying for it, <HI>is stealing;</HI> so I won't go with you."</Q>
This gentleman not then quite seven years old, all Canterbury rang with this
tale. Mrs. Berkeley asked her little Robert if he thought he should have
been as honest as his dear friend Samuel? To which he made the following
reply:
<Q REND="inline">"God knows—God knows, my dear Mamma, if I had been
tempted, what <HI>I might</HI> have done; THANK God, THANK God, they did not
<HI>ask</HI> me;"</Q> and he shuddered as he energetically uttered the
reply. This lovely creature was, to be sure, wonderfully ambitious. He
repeatedly, until told it was a wicked idea, asked his mother,
<Q REND="inline">"Mamma, if I was to read Greek and Latin all day and all
night, and study violently hard, could I come to be a King? I should
<HI>like</HI> to be a King."</Q> Such a thought never entered the head of his
dear brother, nor perhaps of any other child.</NOTE>!"</L>

SEVERAL things of Mr. Berkeley's writing having been
noticed, some quite ready for publication at the time of
his decease; the Editor feels it a sort of duty to mention a
work <HI>not</HI> ready for the press, not <HI>even</HI> written, but con∣stantly
<HI>talked</HI> of by Mr. Berkeley from the early age of fif∣teen—a
work in defence of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION,
as taught in the purest Church on Earth, the superexcel∣lent
CHURCH OF ENGLAND. Dr. Berkeley used now and
then to say, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Berkeley, when are we to see <HI>your</HI>
defence of the Christian Religion?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. M. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Why, my dear Sir, not yet; al∣though
I never shall be quite happy until <HI>I have</HI>
done it."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Why not then do it directly?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I will tell you, my dear Sir; I am resolved
not to do it until I have, if GOD spares my life, esta∣blished,
at least have endeavoured to establish, <HI>such</HI> a
character in <HI>my own</HI> profession (the Law) as shall in∣duce
<PB N="180" REF="822"/>
men of sense to read it with the attention that, <HI>I
hope,</HI> it will merit."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley, although he failed, alas! to keep
the resolution, formed when about eight years old<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Coming into his Mother's dressing-room, and seeing what her witty sister used to call <HI>her Vesper Book,</HI> and, when both young women, used to threaten to tie round her neck, and her bed around her waist, because the Editor in general wished to retire to rest at eleven (that is, Dean Hickes's Reformed Devotions) lying on her table, took it up, and, twirling it over, stumbled on the hymn in the Office for Sunday Vespers, reading the lines,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>"How cross art thou<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>i.e.</HI> the

<L>"For which we had our birth?</L>

<L>"All that to thee submit:</L>
<L>"Thou strew'st some flowers on the brink,</L>
<L>"To drown us in the pit."</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Mr. Berkeley, then just turned of eight years old, as mentioned above, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"No, no; I promise you, I won't stoop to pick them up. <HI>They shan't drown me</HI> with their <HI>fine flowers.</HI> One must be a fool <HI>indeed</HI> to do that!"</Q></P></NOTE>, ever <PB N="181" REF="823"/> felt the necessity of Religion for
all who hope to be happy here and hereafter; a strong proof of which he gave
the last time of his being at Bath. He and his excellent un∣wearied friend,
Mr. Grimston, lodged and boarded at Mr. Garret's.</P>
<P>A <HI>bon mot</HI> of Mr. Whitaker's cannot here be omitted.
Dr. Berkeley, &amp;c. going one day to visit Dr. Berkeley's
relation, the very worthy Colonel Butler, at Thorpe; on
their arrival, they found he had died three days before,
Mr. Whitaker rode up to the carriage, and enquiring how
Mr. Monck Berkeley did? and where he was? hearing
that he was at Bath, said, <Q REND="inline">"I am going thither in two
days; where shall I find him?"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"At Mr. Garret's."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Whitaker.—<Q REND="inline">"'Pshaw! how could I be such a block∣head
to ask?—a POET is always in a GARRET."</Q></P>
<P>Several gentlemen boarded, who could not lodge, at
Mr. Garret's. Amongst these was the, at Bath, well∣known
Captain Lawley.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="824"/>
Soon after the arrival of Mr. Grimston and Mr. Berkeley,
this wretched Captain began to <HI>instruct</HI> the two young men
in the <HI>pleasing</HI> doctrine of there being <HI>no</HI> God, &amp;c. &amp;c.
that the idea of Hell and its Prince was all a bug-a-boo, to
keep silly <HI>women</HI> in a little order. Many arguments did
these two young Christian men use with this wretched old
Atheist; but all, alas! in vain. One day he was missed
from dinner; the second he appeared not. On an enquiry
being sent to his lodgings, word was brought that he was
very ill. Mr. Grimston and Mr. Berkeley went to call on
him, and found him, as his apothecary said, very dangerously
ill indeed, with little hope of recovery. Both were ex∣ceedingly
shocked at his situation. Mr. Grimston earnestly
requested Mr. Berkeley to talk to him concerning his soul.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"Alas! no, my dear friend, he NOW
wants an abler counsellor than I am."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grimston.—<Q REND="inline">"What can we do for him?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"We will go, and request the favour of that
gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has forgotten the gentleman's name; but thinks that it was Mr. Jackson, rector of St. Jame's church.</NOTE>, whose preaching we both so much admire,
to go him, to talk to him, and pray with him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="825"/>
They immediately went to Mr. Jackson, who said to
them, <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen, out of respect to you, as you seem
so earnestly to wish it, <HI>I</HI> will go; but am consident I shall
make no more impression on him than on this marble
hearth on which I stand; for he is the most <HI>determined</HI>
Atheist, the <HI>greatest</HI> ridiculer of every thing sacred, that
is any where to be found."</Q></P>
<P>The young gentlemen, however, continued very de∣sirous,
and the worthy Divine complied; so each party
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>delivered their own soul:</HI>"</Q> but, lamentable thought! the
wretched Captain Lawley resolved to die as he had lived,
and meet Bug-a-boo, <Q>"Unhousel'd, unanneal'd, unanointed."</Q></P>
<P>One day, when the two gentlemen were visiting him
during his illness, he fixed his eyes earnestly in silence on
Mr. Berkeley, and at length said, <Q REND="inline">"Mr. Berkeley, I should
be very glad of a pair of your old shoes, Sir."</Q> Mr.
Berkeley, rather distressed, said, smiling, <Q REND="inline">"My <HI>old</HI> shoes,
Captain Lawley? I believe my servant would object to
that; but, if a pair of my new ones will do as well, I am
sure there are a pair or two, if you please, very much at
<PB N="184" REF="826"/>
your service."</Q> He looked thoughtful, and replied, <Q REND="inline">"I
think I should like <HI>your</HI> shoes."</Q> Mr. Grimston conceived
that he meant it, as is sometimes said, <Q REND="inline">"I would not be
in his shoes, or his coat,"</Q> when any one is in a scrape.</P>
<P>On opening the Captain's will at his death, it appeared
that he had, during his very few days illness, made a will
in favour of a gentleman, who, a few days before it, had
caused the gentleman and, the Editor thinks, some ladies
of character who boarded at Mr. Garret's (by their ser∣vants)
to prevent Captain Lawley from fighting this gentle∣man,
by contriving to prevent their meeting one evening.
He had, by this <HI>wonderful</HI> will, ruined two very near rela∣tions
(the Editor thinks nieces) whom he had obliged to
give up keeping a very good school for young ladies, by
allowing them handsomely, and promising to leave them
his fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley was so convinced that the Captain's
intellects were deranged, from the beginning of his illness,
that, being about to leave Bath, he left his address in
writing with some proper person, saying, <Q REND="inline">"If the will was
contested by the relations, he was ready to give his evi∣dence
whenever called upon."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="827"/>
On the publication of the Captain's will, the very wor∣thy
Sir Robert Lawley, Baronet, his cousin-german, said,
<Q REND="inline">"It should be contested <HI>entirely</HI> at his expence, on behalf
of his worthy kinswomen; and that himself would not
come in for a shilling of the fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Some months before Mr. Monck Berkeley's death, he
received a letter from Doctors Commons, requesting to
know when it would be convenient to him to receive some
gentlemen thence, to take his depositions concerning Cap∣tain
Lawley. He appointed an early day; and several gen∣tlemen
arrived one morning, from Wood's at Maidenhead
Bridge, at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham, stayed near two hours
with Mr. Monck Berkeley, received his deposition; and,
the Editor hopes, some <HI>very thick</HI> good Vannilla chocolate,
sandwiches, white wine and water, &amp;c. which she or∣dered
to be sent in to them.</P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley requested, if he lived until it was decided,
that he might be informed whether the will were established
or not. About a fortnight before his lamented death he
received a letter from a gentleman of the Commons, telling
<PB N="186" REF="828"/>
him that the Court had rejected the will of Captain
Lawley.</P>
<P>It were much to be wished that the Ecclesiastical Court
could sometimes act as a Court of EQUITY. They would,
they should surely, had they been applied to, have set
aside the will of a wretched old Fanatic of Hull, who
after having kept his dutiful, amiable, only son near
nine years with an eminent Clergyman of the Church of
England, who takes private pupils, sent him down to
Scotland to the University of St. Andrew's; as he wrote
to Dr. Forrest, one of the Professors, <Q REND="inline">"that he might learn
to preach the <HI>everlasting Gospel,</HI> as a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> minister
in England."</Q> Mr. Rogers was accordingly, to his great
distress, entered of the Divinity Colledge. The wonderful
amiability of his nature, and the sweetness of his manners,
rendered him universally beloved by persons of all ranks.
His zeal to succour and save, and his generosity <HI>when saved,</HI>
to poor shipwrecked persons on the coast of St. Andrew's,
used to occasion Mr. Monck Berkeley's saying, <Q REND="inline">"Well,
now Rogers <HI>is</HI> happy; he is posting off to a wreck, with
three or four bottles, and blankets innumerable. He
<PB N="187" REF="829"/>
has ordered beds to be ready for all the poor creatures
that are escaped."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Rogers attended divine service regularly at Dr.
Berkeley's every Sunday. Several letters arrived from the
father, asking when his son would be FIT <HI>to preach</HI> in the
<HI>Meeting-house</HI> that <HI>he</HI> had <HI>built</HI> ready for him. This diverted
his friends: but, as the frogs in the fable say, <Q REND="inline">"Although
it is <HI>sport to you,</HI> it is <HI>death to us.</HI>"</Q> Poor Mr. Rogers,
extremely distressed, applied, as hundreds of others did, to
Dr. Berkeley for advice and direction; who told him, <Q REND="inline">"that
perhaps, if his wish was to become a Divine of the Church
of England, he had better apply to his Father, who, as
his grand desire seemed to be to <HI>hear</HI> his son <HI>preach,</HI> and
as he was very rich, might buy the next presentation
of a living with an aged incumbent on it."</Q> The case was
properly stated to the old man; who soon returned for an∣swer,
<Q REND="inline">"that, having met with some <HI>Baptists,</HI> who had agreed
to give him a <HI>very high</HI> rent for his meeting-house, he had
let it to them, left the Presbyterians, and become a
<HI>Baptist himself;</HI> and his son might be of the Church of
England if he pleased."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="830"/>
Dr. Berkeley, with his wonted goodness, applied to his
old tutor, the present Archbishop of York, stating the case
to his Grace, and requesting him to ordain Mr. Rogers,
on the testimonial of several of the respectable Professors at
St. Andrew's with regard to his life and conversation.</P>
<P>The Editor supposes that the testimonial of the learned
Dean Hill, Professors Hunter, Baron, Cook, &amp;c. of Mr.
Rogers's learning, life, and conversation, and Dr. Berke∣ley's
<HI>own</HI> knowledge of his holding <Q REND="inline">"no doctrine con∣trary
to the Church of England as by law established,"</Q>
induced his Grace to ordain the very worthy young man,
without a testimonial from Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin.
Perhaps the Editor, in this last sentence, may be wri∣ting
like a fool, as she has not for many years heard
a testimonial for orders redde. If she has so done, she
is sorry for it. The old man was so delighted, that he
set off in his post-chaise and <HI>four</HI> for York, to see his son
ordained in that magnificent Cathedral. He was quite
transported, and had <HI>some</HI> thoughts of becoming a mem∣ber
of the Church of England. However, that idea was
<HI>transient;</HI> and on his amiable son's going to settle at
or near Hull, this old <HI>numpscull</HI> insisted on his <HI>preaching</HI>
<PB N="189" REF="831"/>
at the <HI>Baptist</HI> meeting; which Mr. Rogers utterly refusing
to do, he cast him off, married a young Baptist, and entirely
disinherited him; and this throughly amiable man is now,
as the Editor hears from her beloved excellent friend,
Henry Grimston, Esquire, a distressed Curate at or near
Beverley in Yorkshire. The old wretch allowed him very
handsomely during his residence at the University of St.
Andrew's, or his bounties to the poor could not have been
so extensive as all then resident there knew them to be;
but even then <Q REND="inline">"the <HI>beast</HI> shewed his nature."</Q></P>
<P>His only daughter, as Mr. Rogers was his only son, was
married to Captain Lee, the first officer, as it was then said,
who ever sailed from England in a copper-bottomed vessel.</P>
<P>This gentleman was either dead, or the ship and crew
supposed to be lost, or carried into slavery; the Editor thinks
the latter to have been the case. And no entreaties could
prevail on this vile old HODMADOD to tell his poor son in
what part of the kingdom his sister, with, the Editor
thinks, four young children, resided.</P>
<P>The Editor, one day asking her Son what could induce
the wretch, if he was in his senses, to be such a BRUTE; he
<PB N="190" REF="832"/>
replied, in his most sweetly plaintive voice, when feeling the
woes of other, <Q REND="inline">"Alas! my dear Mother, he <HI>is</HI> in his senses;
but he <HI>wants</HI> the <HI>sense</HI> of <HI>feeling,</HI> which he knows <HI>his son</HI> has
in an eminent degree; and he is afraid that Rogers should
assist his, I sadly fear, distressed sister, as it is so long since
her husband has been heard of, and Rogers knows her
father <HI>won't</HI> relieve her, <HI>because,</HI> the <HI>week</HI> before she was
with <HI>his</HI> consent to be married to Captain Lee, he bade
her <HI>turn him off,</HI> and marry a young, plump Presbyte∣rian
parson that he brought to her; but she preferred
Captain Lee; and her <HI>cunning</HI> father took <HI>that</HI> opportu∣nity
to pocket the fortune he had promised to give to
Captain Lee with her."</Q></P>
<P>It is surely a defect in our laws, although excellent in
general, that a vilely covetous, or horridly capricious father
or mother, can, at their <HI>own</HI> pleasure, either beggar or
damn, perhaps both in one, their own ill-fated offspring.</P>
<P>Parents should have <HI>all</HI> power during youth, <HI>none</HI> at all
after children come to years of discretion; and, if they are
<HI>wise</HI> or <HI>just,</HI> if they have it, let them renounce it, as the Edi∣tor
<PB N="191" REF="833"/>
always solemnly protested to Dr. Berkeley that she would
do, he using to say, when his children were young, that he
would leave them dependant on her for bread, that they
might be dutiful. Mrs. Berkeley assured him, that much
within a month after his decease she would put it out of
her power to rob the children of a dead father; that she
would, by God's blessing, make them dutiful, although
they had an independance of ten thousand a year.</P>
<P>The Editor was exceedingly delighted the first time she
heard it, and has diverted many persons since, with the
account given of herself by the late, sensible, agreeable Lady
Grey, of Denne Hill, Kent, mother of the late Sir James
Grey, many years his Majesty's Ambassador to the Court of
Spain,</P>
<P>The Editor has an old trick, like her late excellent rela∣tion,
Sir Martin Wright, of thinking aloud. It is in her
quite involuntary, as she conceives it must have been in
him. When sitting on the <HI>judgement-seat,</HI> he would say
loud enough to be heard by the barristers, some of whom
she has heard relate it to her mother: <Q REND="inline">"WELL PUT, Mr.
Hume Campbell; <HI>that</HI> will do."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline">"OH!
<PB N="192" REF="834"/>
LAMENTABLE, LAMENTABLE! Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, <HI>that will</HI>
never <HI>do, never do at all.</HI>"</Q> So the Editor, the first visit
she made at Denne Hill, on entering the room where hung
a magnificent whole-length portrait of the then King of
Spain, of whom Mr. Clarke gives so curious an account,
as also of the lamentations of his amiable Queen, when the
sentence of death was pronounced to her, not by <HI>French
devils,</HI> but by her wise, pious Confessor; the Editor's
eyes being better then than now, she caught Dr. Berkeley,
entering just behind her, by the arm, exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Oh!—look,
do look at that man; HE must be the uniting link
in the chain, between man and brute, between man and
devil."</Q> This was quite involuntary. Had she known it
had been the MONSTER MONARCH, who, to try a new
fowling-piece, took aim and killed a poor mason's labourer
ascending a ladder in view, the <HI>pre-jugée</HI> might have had
share in her sentence. To be sure, according to the Edi∣tor's
idea, it is the most extraordinary countenance she
ever saw.</P>
<P>The witty, worthy Lady Grey, who became a widow
before she was thirty, and continued such until ninety,
when, the oil all exhausted, the lamp went gently out,
<PB N="193" REF="835"/>
used to say, <Q REND="inline">"I don't know how it is that young widows
marry so fast: <HI>I</HI> could not contrive to do it. To be
sure, <HI>very soon</HI> after Sir James's death, I had a multitude
of lovers, from Lords and Commons. I heard of nothing
but my <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>wit.</HI> However, as soon as I had a
little dried my eyes for the death of poor Sir James, I
sent for a lawyer, and settled the money (about an hun∣dred
thousand pounds) that he had left <HI>entirely</HI> in my
power on his poor little orphans; and whether it was
that I grew ugly and foolish at <HI>nine and twenty,</HI> or <HI>what
else</HI> I know not; but so it was, <HI>I</HI> never heard a word
more of my wit or beauty, nor ever had a lover after∣wards."</Q>
Her witty Ladyship had admirers, if not lovers,
to the last of her long life on earth.</P>
<P>A poor, old, doating, rich Divine in the neighbourhood
of Cloyne, a widower with several children, was going to
marry a girl; it reached the ears of Bishop Berkeley, who
immediately visited him, and, introducing the subject, the
old gentleman said, <Q REND="inline">"that he should not have thought of
it, but that the <HI>young Lady was so exceedingly in love with
him.</HI>"</Q> How much weaker is <HI>second</HI> childhood, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>sans
eyes, sans teeth,</HI>"</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. than the first! The Bishop
<PB N="194" REF="836"/>
said, <Q REND="inline">"if that was the case, the Lady would at any rate
marry him."</Q> He assented, and the Bishop prevailed on
him to settle his fortune on his children after his own
death; which so entirely cured the young lady's <HI>violent
passion</HI> for him, that he was suffered to go to his grave under
the care of his worthy children, the best guardians for aged
persons when God vouchsafes to spare them.</P>
<P>Dr. Berkeley used sometimes to ask Mrs. Berkeley,
<Q REND="inline">"what could induce her to marry, who could well enough
manage all her own business?"</Q> &amp;c. Her uniform reply
was, <Q REND="inline">"That she might enjoy, and improve by, the con∣versation
of a man, of many men of superior under∣standing,
whilst she had sense enough left to enjoy it,
and to have some sensible, worthy children to <HI>love</HI> and
GOVERN her, if she should (which she <HI>never</HI> wished,
always dreaded, yet never dared to pray against) attain to
old age."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor used frequently to conjure her dear Son, if
she should attain to old age, to govern <HI>her</HI> as carefully as
she had governed <HI>him</HI> in his childhood.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="837"/>
The Editor is just returned from her Parish-church,
where, it being (December 21) Saint Thomas's day, she
heard the proper lesson, Proverbs xxiii. one of her <HI>guiding</HI>
chapters, and where every reward promised to a watchful
parent is recorded. She humbly praised the mercy of God,
he had vouchsafed to permit her to experience in its <HI>fullest</HI>
extent.</P>
<P>But the Editor did not wish her Son to govern her <HI>exactly</HI>
in the same mode in which she had governed him, not
looking up upon him for two days, one of Mr. Monck
Berkeley's punishments from about seven to ten years old,
sitting on the same chair without moving for an hour—once,
alas! for full three hours by the carelessness of his
mother. One day before tea-time he was ordered to sit
on a <HI>particular</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of Mr. Monck Berkeley's punishments from three to eight years old. In one room at his Father's ten chairs stood in one row. His Mother used, generally, to point to the one at the upper end. Mr. Berkeley from three years and an half would regularly go to the lowest, not out of <HI>humility,</HI> but, to use a <HI>coined</HI> word of the Editor, WILFULLITY, then to the next, to which his <HI>ever</HI>-STEADY Mother said, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>not that.</HI>"</Q> Thus he constantly strove for victory <HI>nine</HI> times; and, after standing some time at the tenth, <HI>wriggled</HI> himself upon it.</NOTE> chair in the Library. His Mother, called
<PB N="196" REF="838"/>
into the Drawing-room to make tea, left him; before tea
was quite over, Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"It is a heavenly
evening; we will cross the water, and walk to Cliefden.
Be quick. My dear, get your hat."</Q> The Editor never,
when young, made <HI>any</HI> one wait for <HI>her,</HI> especially her Mother,
and her Lord and Master, as she used <HI>(en badinant)</HI> to style Dr.
Berkeley, called her maid, got her hat, &amp;c. and skipped
away, thoughtless of her sweet little prisoner until she had
crossed the Thames, when she wished to have returned;
but Dr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! he'll get off when he finds
you gone out."</Q> The Editor expressed her fear that he
would not; but she proceeded on her walk. On her re∣turn,
she was met at the ferry by Mr. Monck Berkeley's
ever-kind friend, John, lest she should make any call in the
village; saying, <Q REND="inline">"Will you be pleased, Madam, to go
home, that Master Berkeley may go to bed (then nine
o'clock, he just seven years old), for none of <HI>us</HI> can
prevail upon him to stir off the chair, where, he says,
you <HI>ordered</HI> him to sit, and not stir till <HI>you</HI> came to him.
We promised him you would not be angry; but nothing
would do, and there he sits."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="839"/>
The Editor left Dr. Berkeley, and ran home the shortest
way she could find, through all the high, dew-besprinkled
grass, to her obedient little man.</P>
<P>When Mr. Berkeley was about thirteen, he one day said
to his Mother, <Q REND="inline">"I wish you would be so good as to write
upon a sheet of paper these words, GEORGE-MONCK
BERKELEY <HI>is a very dutiful Son.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"No, indeed, my dear, I won't write
any such thing."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I <HI>wish</HI> you would."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, I cannot; for I don't think it."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"I am sorry you do not."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"So am I; but you know how wilful you
are."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, but I always obey you <HI>at last.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes; but that is not being DUTY—FUL."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well; but I am OBEDIENT then."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, you certainly do <HI>obey me.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, then, you will be so good as to write
<PB N="198" REF="840"/>
on this sheet of paper, 'GEORGE-MONCK BERKELEY <HI>is
an</HI> OBEDIENT SON."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes, if it will oblige you."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! yes, it will indeed."</Q></P>
<P>The words were immediately written. The sweet
lad's eyes sparkled with joy when he redde them. He
carefully folded them up, and walked away to his own
room. At dinner the curious dialogue was related to dear
Dr. Berkeley, and the Editor never heard or thought of it
more, until examining the small trunk, containing many of
his precious deposits, delivered into her hands by the
faithful Mrs. Leycester, Mr. Berkeley's bed-maker at Mag∣dalen
Hall, mentioned before in this Preface. This <HI>testi∣monial</HI>
of her dear Son's obedience, signed, as requested,
with her name, lay carefully folded.</P>
<P>The Editor, from a youth, had always told Mr. Berke∣ley,
that he was the <HI>eldest Son</HI> in the Gospel, <Q REND="inline">"Son, go
work to-day in my vineyard, &amp;c.—yet afterwards he
repented, and went."</Q> Mr. Berkeley used frequently to
quote it on his Mother.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="841"/>
Once, when she requested him much to visit in town a
very old friend of hers, well known in the <HI>ton</HI> world, but
who did not happen to hit Mr. Berkeley's fancy, and he
begged to be excused visiting the gentleman; Mrs.
Berkeley replied, <Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear, then let it alone."</Q>
He said, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Mother, I have a very large ac∣quaintance
in town; and I cannot spend all my time in
visiting. That will not fit me for the Bar."</Q></P>
<P>The morning that he was leaving the Oaks he crept to
his Mother's bed-side, saying, <Q REND="inline">"My dear Madam, I will
wait on <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear, do not if it is disagreeable
to you."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Yes I must. I <HI>ought</HI> to have said I would do
it on your first mentioning it to me, but I <HI>could not.</HI> You
know you have always told me, that I am the <HI>eldest Son</HI>
the Gospel. I cannot help it; I wish I could."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Indeed, my dear child, I am much happier
that you are; the <HI>eldest</HI> rather than the <HI>younger</HI> Son men∣tioned by our Blessed Master."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="842"/>
The Editor's request to her dear son to govern her, in
return for her having <HI>so well</HI> governed him, recals to mind
what he one day said at St. Andrew's.</P>
<P>Soon after his return from a visit in the Country to his
beloved friend, the universally beloved, respected, amiable
Sir John Ramsay, Advocate in Edinburgh, whose early
death, at twenty-eight, Mr. Berkeley never ceased to
lament, when speaking of that excellent young gentleman.
Mr. Berkeley said, <Q REND="inline">"I am certainly a very lucky fellow;
for, let me go where I will, I <HI>always find</HI> a mother. At
Cookham, when my mother was not in company, if I
said or did any aukward ridiculous thing, my dear Mrs.
M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s always <HI>set me</HI> to-rights, or well tuned me for it:—and here in <HI>Scotland</HI> Lady Ramsay takes me in hand."</Q>
His great good sense, like that of his dear friend Mr.
Grimston, made him add, <Q REND="inline">"I am sure I am much obliged
to them."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grimston, one day speaking of the son of a York∣shire
Baronet, said, <Q REND="inline">"he has had <HI>great</HI> advantages by being
in the Militia, because Mrs. [Masters], (the Editor thinks
<PB N="201" REF="843"/>
was the name of the Colonel's Lady), has taken to
him, and <HI>tutored</HI> him just as Mrs. Berkeley does me;
and, &amp;c. &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Monck Berkeley used to tell his father, that he
heard some of his mother's friends say, that in her youth
<Q REND="inline">"She had a wonderful <HI>knack</HI> of making the young men
<HI>know</HI> their distance, and respect her; and, he was sure,
(he was too polite to say, now that she is <HI>old,</HI> but) now
that she is not young, she has a <HI>blessed knack</HI> of <HI>tuning</HI>
the young men that visit here."</Q> To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich his Mother
used to reply, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, and do not you often tell your
Father, that <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> love <HI>your</HI>
Mother almost as well as you do?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Oh! yes, my dear Madam, all the fellows of
<HI>good sense</HI> like you wonderfully."</Q></P>
<P>It is very <HI>salutary</HI> for young men to meet with old-lady-advisers;
as it is surely happy for young women, if they
are wise enough to profit by it, to have a wise male adviser
who has lived in the world, who knows life, as it is
wire-termed. A wise wife or father, or a worthy (some
<PB N="202" REF="844"/>
years-older) brother, can tell a young lady <HI>many</HI> things, that
will render her pleasing or displeasing to the young men,
that a mother cannot; and, let young ladies <HI>deny it ever so
strongly,</HI> they all wish to be, if not admired, at least <HI>not dis∣pleasing</HI>
in the opinion young men of <HI>sense.</HI> A diverting
dialogue might here be related, which passed almost thirty
years ago, between the late excellent Lord Lyttelton, the
well known very sensible Miss Charlotte B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, and
the Editor, on <HI>this</HI> subject, when he exclaimed, on the
public walk at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, <Q REND="inline">"How I do <HI>honour</HI> Mrs. Berkeley's
honesty!"</Q> adding, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>I know</HI> also, that ALL the ladies in
England <HI>love</HI> elegancies; but I know but TWO that are
<HI>honest</HI> enough to avow it, Mrs. Montagu and Mrs. Berke∣ley."</Q>
The throughly elegant Mrs. Montagu has ever
had it in her power to gratify that innocent taste; Mrs.
Berkeley only in taking care that dear Dr. Berkeley's vi∣sitors
got comfortable sort of dinners, and clean nice sleep∣ing
rooms, &amp;c. all that persons of moderate fortune, who are
blessed with children to educate and provide for, can justly
aim at; for elegancies, when butcher, baker, &amp;c. are <HI>un∣paid,</HI>
become <HI>sinful</HI> vanities.</P>
<P>But to return to the INCOMPARABLE Lady Ramsay,
as the late Lord Kinnoul styled her Ladyship when
<PB N="203" REF="845"/>
speaking of her to the Editor, who had not the honour to
be known to her Ladyship. His Lordship one day said,
<Q REND="inline">"I wish you <HI>did</HI> know her. I do not think there is a
cleverer woman upon the face of the whole earth."</Q> Mr.
Monck Berkeley one day said, <Q REND="inline">"When I was at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of Sir John's seat is not recollected by the Editor; he being a Baronet, of course was not called by it, as all gentlemen of fortune <HI>sine</HI> title are in Scotland.</NOTE>,
we had been out shooting all the morning; and after tea
Lady Ramsay and her elegant young ladies being drawn
round the table to work, Sir John and Mr. Berkeley on
the sofa, the former said softly, 'Come, let us lie heads
and points, and rest ourselves a little.' Lady Ramsay
soon perceiving their situation, said, "Mr. Berkeley, I have
not the honour <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Her Ladyship was, as very sensible persons of rank generally are, very condescending to speak thus.</NOTE> to know Mrs. Berkeley, but from what
I have heard from many of her friends, <HI>I do not</HI> think that
she would quite approve of your present situation, when
there are <HI>ladies</HI> in the room. Sir John, are not you
ashamed of yourself, to lay your length on the sofa when
your mother and sisters are in the room?"</Q> Mr. Berkeley
said, <Q REND="inline">"I think I never felt <HI>more</HI> ashamed in my whole life.
<PB N="204" REF="846"/>
I sprang upon my feet in an instant, begged her Lady∣ship
ten thousand pardons, thanked her a thousand
times for her goodness; and, I assured her, that my
Mother would have <HI>well tuned</HI> me had she seen me guilty
of such horrid inattention to ladies, or to gentlemen my
superiors or elders."</Q></P>
<P>The Editor, when Mr. Berkeley was little more than a
youth, one day after dining out reproached him for not
peeling, as well as cracking the walnuts for the young lady
by whom he sat at dinner, adding, <Q REND="inline">"that when <HI>she</HI> was a
young woman, and sat near gentlemen, they always
peeled them for her."</Q> Mr. Berkeley, then but very
young, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! my dear Mother, thank Fate, the
girls in <HI>these</HI> days have <HI>found</HI> the <HI>use</HI> of their <HI>fingers.</HI> I
<HI>always</HI> crack them for them, and, I think, <HI>they may</HI> very
well <HI>peel them</HI> for themselves."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley felt very sincerely for his highly respected
friend Lady Ramsay, the loss of two so amiable sons in the
very prime of life. He felt, indeed, for ALL in distress,
<Q REND="inline">"whether of <HI>mind, body,</HI> or <HI>estate;</HI>"</Q> a strong proof of which
the Editor cannot forbear reciting here. During his resi∣dence
<PB N="205" REF="847"/>
in the University at St. Andrew's Dr. Berkeley
dining in the country, soon after dinner Mr. Berkeley
walked out, and returning immediately, flew into the eating
room, and exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"Best of Mothers, how <HI>can you</HI> sit
reading here as if nothing had happened?"</Q> The Editor
sprang up, saying, <Q REND="inline">"Good God, child, has your Father been
overturned."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Berkeley.—<Q REND="inline">"<HI>No, I hope not;</HI> but a poor unhappy man's
foot is just now torn off above his ancle, by the mill."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, my dear child, could I know that by
inspiration?"</Q></P>
<P>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No; but pray do something for him. They
have sent for Flint<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Flint, the very learned, experienced, almost always successful, Professor of Physic in the University at St. Andrew's.</NOTE> and Melville<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Melville, a most excellent Surgeon.</NOTE>, and they are both
out of town."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. B.—<Q REND="inline">"Well, if he is bleeding violently, I can send
John with some Manchester styptic<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This incomparable medicine, when genuine, not here called by its right name, which is Hatfield's styptic, once saved Mr. Monck Berkeley's life when a child, when nearly all the blood in his veins was exhausted, and nothing could staunch the bleeding. The moment this was applied it ceased; but that was genuine, prepared by, and procured from, the honest wife of the Manchester baker; to whom a famous French surgeon, in gratitude for her goodness in nursing him through a very long illness, communicated the secret. For years it was sold only in Manchester. Happy for the public had it continued, as well as some other famous Patent Medicines, in honest hands. The Editor means, if God spares her life, to give in the Gentleman's Magazine some account of the almost miraculous cures wrought by this astonishingly fine medicine, as many medical gentlemen, high in their pro∣fession, have declared it to be, when they have by their <HI>eloquence</HI> prevailed on the Editor to let them taste it—she not exhibiting to the <HI>Faculty,</HI> left they should maliciously laugh, as she tells them, and call her <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Lady Boun∣tiful.</HI>"</Q> Alas! she cannot now get it from Mr. Hatfield the baker's daughter at Manchester. There is a poor wretched thing, called <Q REND="inline">"Hat∣field's styptic,"</Q> sold by the man who obliged, happily for the public, Messrs. Hoopers to take into their own hands again the preparing their fa∣ther Dr. Hooper's excellent pills. These pills, genuine, cured a respecta∣ble old servant of the Editor's of seven large wounds in one leg; not that ALL Patent Medicines, prepared by the Proprietors, <HI>if</HI> they happen to be covetous, are genuine, as the Editor's poor weakened stomach lamentably feels, and pretty certainly will feel as long as she continues an inhabitant of this sublunary world. She hopes and believes that her private admonition has, on his <HI>own</HI> account, wrought re-formation on the Medicine, if not on Preparer. Respect for the very worthy vender keeps the name of the said adulterated medicine from being published; as she verily believes it is since her visit in <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> properly prepared—if not from <HI>principle,</HI> yet from POLICY.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="848"/>Mr. B.—<Q REND="inline">"No, it does not bleed a drop; but send John
with a bottle of wine and some money, to comfort the
<PB N="207" REF="849"/>
poor creature, for God's sake. I have given him some∣thing,
but do you send him more."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Melville soon arrived, the poor man did well, and
perhaps is now living, blessing, with many others in St.
Andrew's, Mr. Monck Berkeley's lovely charity. The
poor man was warned not five minutes before, by a woman
of the mill, to be aware of the rope that tore off his foot;
but warning, alas! does not <HI>always</HI> avail. The neglecting
it must add weight to calamity.</P>
<P>The loss of this poor man's foot recalls to the Editor's
mind the preservation of the leg of a relation of hers, S.
Cherry, Esquire, a cousin-german of Mr. Cherry, who
served in all Queen Anne's wars, under the great Duke of
Marlborough, when besieging <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, the Editor forgets
what place. One day eight or ten officers sat down to
dinner in a saw-pit; they agreed to make a table, by every
man laying his right leg across the pit, instead of dropping
both into it. On beginning their dinner they wanted
salt or mustard; one said, go you; another, go you to
the sutlers; at length Captain Cherry jumped up, saying,
<Q REND="inline">"I will go."</Q> At his return, he found that every officer
<PB N="208" REF="850"/>
had lost a leg; a chain ball had been fired from the battery,
and had quite taken off the leg of some, and so shattered
those of the others, that the surgeon was obliged to am∣putate
them. Poor men, they all lived and went halting
to the <Q REND="inline">"house appointed for all living,"</Q> on one leg, as
the Editor has frequently heard her unmaimed rèlation say,
at fourscore he had not lost one of as fine a set of teeth as
ever were seen, as white as at twenty years old;—his eye∣sight
almost equally good. The Editor has often heard
him and Colonel <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>, a relation of her mother,
relate a very curious transaction that happened between
the Duke of Marlborough and his Aid-de-Camp, Lord
Cadogan, father of the late Duchess of Richmond, that
does honour to both noblemen.</P>
<P>The Editor regrets, always did regret, that she is of a
<HI>terribly</HI> long-lived family, on both sides. It is, however,
some pleasure to her to think that her Father and Mother
both died much younger than she now is; but, alas!
those two excellent Christians were <HI>quite ripe</HI> for GLORY
before they went to enjoy it. She never could quite sub∣scribe
to that beautiful simile in Dean Hickes's "Reformed
Devotions," in one of the Psalms of the Prpa ratory
<PB N="209" REF="851"/>
Office for Death, used every Thursday by the Editor since
her age of seventeen:<Q><L>"No matter how late the fruit be gathered; if it still go
on in growing better.</L>
<L>"No matter how soon it fall from the tree; if not blown
down before it be ripe."</L></Q></P>
<P>To the latter verse she heartily subscribes, although to
the former verse <HI>not quite:</HI> it is only THY WILL, be it
done <HI>in</HI> me, <HI>on</HI> me, and <HI>by</HI> me; that ALONE reconciles her
to the <HI>unpleasantnesses</HI> of OLD AGE.</P>

<HEAD>VERSES by the Pious MR. NORRIS, of <HI>Bemerton;</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Altered by the equally-pious, better-informed, MRS. CATHARINE
TALBOT, of <HI>Lambeth Palace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Several
gentlemen one day at Lambeth Palace, some Divines amongst them, were
admiring these verses of the pious, learned Mr. Norris. Miss Talbot, ever
chearful, evèr delighting to look forward with joy to <HI>that</HI>
world where she, through faith, well knew that happiness <HI>was</HI> to be
found, which she <HI>too</HI> well knew <HI>was not</HI> to be found here,
said,
<Q REND="inline">"I never could bear that Poem of Norris's."</Q> Several, with
one voice, exclaimed,
<Q REND="inline">"Who could have written a finer on <HI>that</HI>
subject?"</Q> She, laughing, replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Any one."</Q> Some one said,
<Q REND="inline">"I wish you would, then."</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"Well, go get me the book, and a pen; and I will at least,
if not make a better, mend that;"</Q> which she immediately certainly did as
above. This is copied from the altered one in the hand-writing of that
loveliest of women. That entirely beloved friend, who gave it to the Editor
the next day, by whom it has been carefully preserved for more than thirty
years, she (Miss Talbot) saying,
<Q REND="inline">"I cannot bear to hear persons, who I really think believe
in the all-sufficiency of Christ, admire such stuff as
<Q><L>"Death could not a more <HI>sad</HI> retinue find,</L>
<L>"Sickness and Pain before—<HI>Darkness</HI> behind."</L></Q></Q> Poets sometimes take <HI>strange</HI> flights. Good Mr. Norris, in
one of his Poems, shocked the Editor, when she was a very young woman,
hardly a woman;—saying, in his Poem on the death of some young
Norfolk lady,
<Q REND="inline">"that Heaven wanted the presence of her (I think Mrs.
Margaret Pastarn's) spirit, to make it a place of <HI>complete</HI>
happiness."</Q> She flew to her Mother, to enquire if it was not BLASPHEMY.
Were Mrs. Frinsham still on earth, the Editor would not trouble her
concerning those lines, she thinking of them just as she did at
fifteen. She blesses GOD that no <HI>such</HI> flights are to be found in
Mr. Monck Berkeley's Poems. The Editor cannot omit mentioning here two short
con∣versations held with her Son at the distance of almost ten years.
When a <HI>very</HI> young man, he shewed to his Mother some charming
verses that he had written to a friend on the death of a <HI>very near</HI>
and dear relation. His Mother said,
<Q REND="inline">"You seem to offer all your consolation from Heathen
Philosophers."</Q> He replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Best of Mothers! what could I do? Would you have had me
offered it from the Bible to a man <HI>that you</HI> know does not believe that
blessed Book!"</Q> The second, near ten years after—Mrs. Berkeley
said,
<Q REND="inline">"My dear, I dare say, although <HI>I</HI> am no judge, that
the lines are very fine; but there is not a <HI>tittle</HI> said of the
<HI>only</HI> thing that could console <HI>you,</HI> were the Almighty to
deprive you of your poor Mother—that she was gone to Christ."</Q> Mr.
Berkeley looked sweetly sad, and replied,
<Q REND="inline">"Oh, best of Mothers! <HI>But I could</HI> not offer THAT
consolation concerning one who I have, alas! <HI>too good</HI> reason to
fear <HI>did not</HI> believe <HI>in</HI> CHRIST—Surely SUCH <HI>can
never go to</HI> HIM. I have said all that my <HI>conscience</HI> would
suffer me to say, to soothe a <HI>little</HI> the anguish of their
spirits on the loss of an <HI>agreeable</HI> Mother."</Q> Christ says,
<Q REND="inline">"Except ye believe that I AM, ye shall die in your
sins."</Q> What a threat to SOCINIANS and to the ARIANS! Lord Monboddo, in
his "Ancient Metaphysics," says,
<Q REND="inline">"The ARIAN HERESY was the <HI>subtlest</HI> that ever
infected the Christian Church."</Q> Many years ago, a gentleman on a visit
at Dr. Berkeley's at Cookham said, that, in his way through London on the
preceding Sunday, resting on the Sabbath∣day, he had heard the following
sentence uttered from the pulpit by a very learned Divine, preaching on the
above-cited words of our adored Redeemer,
<Q REND="inline">"If ye believe not that I AM,"</Q> &amp;c.
<Q REND="inline">"If JESUS CHRIST be not GOD, perfectly equal with the Father,
I had <HI>rather trust</HI> to the BLOOD of a DOG for my Salvation than to
that of CHRIST, who, if not <HI>absolutely equal</HI> with the Father,
<HI>is</HI> an IMPOSTOR."</Q> Some one said,
<Q REND="inline">"That is very <HI>strong</HI> lan∣guage!"</Q> Dr. Berkeley
replied,
<Q REND="inline">"But it is certainly right, or true,"</Q> (the Editor forgets
which word he used. Whatever ARIAN can be happy enough to lay eyes on the
<HI>wonderful</HI> work of the late very deeply learned Reverend Meredith
