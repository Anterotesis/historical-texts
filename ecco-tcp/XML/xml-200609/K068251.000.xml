<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public may depend on the
following fragments as genuine
remains of ancient Scottish poetry. The
date of their composition cannot be ex∣actly
actly ascertained. Tradition, in the
country where they were written, refers
them to an aera of the most remote anti∣quity:
and this tradition is supported by
the spirit and strain of the poems them∣selves;
which abound with those
ideas, and paint those manners, that
belong to the most early state of so∣ciety.
The diction too, in the origi∣nal,
is very obsolete; and differs wide∣ly
from the style of such poems as have
been written in the same language two
or three centuries ago. They were cer∣tainly
composed before the establish∣ment
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
of clanship in the northern part
of Scotland, which is itself very an∣cient;
for had clans been then formed
and known, they must have made a con∣siderable
figure in the work of a Highland
Bard; whereas there is not the least men∣tion
of them in these poems. It is remark∣able
that there are found in them no allu∣sions
to the Christian religion or worship;
indeed, few traces of religion of any kind.
One circumstance seems to prove them
to be coeval with the very infancy of
Christianity in Scotland. In a frag∣ment
of the same poems, which the
translator has seen, a Culdee or Monk
is represented as desirous to take down
in writing from the mouth of Oscian,
who is the principal personage in several
of the following fragments, his warlike
atchievements and those of his family.
But Oscian treats the monk and his reli∣gion
with disdain, telling him, that the
deeds of such great men were subjects too
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
high to be recorded by him, or by any
of his religion: A full proof that
Christianity was not as yet established
in the country.</P>
<P>Though the poems now published
appear as detached pieces in this col∣lection,
there is ground to believe that
most of them were originally episodes
of a greater work which related to the
wars of Fingal. Concerning this hero
innumerable traditions remain, to this
day, in the Highlands of Scotland. The
story of Oscian, his son, is so generally
known, that to describe one in whom
the race of a great family ends, it has
passed into a proverb; <Q REND="inline">"Oscian the last
of the heroes."</Q></P>
<P>There can be no doubt that these
poems are to be ascribed to the Bards;
a race of men well known to have conti∣nued
throughout many ages in Ireland
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
and the north of Scotland. Every chief
or great man had in his family a Bard or
poet, whose office it was to record in
verse, the illustrious actions of that fa∣mily.
By the succession of these Bards,
such poems were handed down from race
to race; some in manuscript, but more
by oral tradition. And tradition, in a
country so free of intermixture with fo∣reigners,
and among a people so strong∣ly
attached to the memory of their an∣cestors,
has preserved many of them in
a great measure incorrupted to this day.</P>
<P>They are not set to music, nor sung.
The versification in the original is
simple; and to such as understand the
language, very smooth and beautiful.
Rhyme is seldom used: but the cadence,
and the length of the line varied, so as to
suit the sense. The translation is ex∣tremely
literal. Even the arrangement
of the words in the original has been
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
imitated; to which must be imputed
some inversions in the style, that other∣wise
would not have been chosen.</P>
<P>Of the poetical merit of these frag∣ments
nothing shall here be said. Let
the public judge, and pronounce. It
is believed, that, by a careful inquiry,
many more remains of ancient genius,
no less valuable than those now given
to the world, might be found in the
same country where these have been
collected. In particular there is reason
to hope that one work of considerable
length, and which deserves to be styled
an heroic poem, might be recovered and
translated, if encouragement were given
to such an undertaking. The sub∣ject
is, an invasion of Ireland by
Swarthan King of Lochlyn; which is
the name of Denmark in the Erse lan∣guage.
Cuchulaid, the General or Chief
of the Irish tribes, upon intelligence of the
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
invasion, assembles his forces. Councils
are held; and battles fought. But af∣ter
several unsuccessful engagements,
the Irish are forced to submit. At
length, Fingal King of Scotland, called
in this poem, "The Desert of the hills,"
arrives with his ships to assist Cuchu∣laid.
He expels the Danes from the
country; and returns home victorious.
This poem is held to be of greater anti∣quity
than any of the rest that are pre∣served:
And the author speaks of him∣self
as present in the expedition of Fin∣gal.
The three last poems in the collec∣tion
are fragments which the translator
obtained of this epic poem; and though
very imperfect, they were judged not
unworthy of being inserted. If the
whole were recovered, it might serve to
throw considerable light upon the Scot∣tish
and Irish antiquities.</P>

<HEAD>FRAGMENT I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>SHILRIC, VINVELA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY love is a son of the hill.
He pursues the flying deer.
His grey dogs are panting
around him; his bow-string sounds in
the wind. Whether by the fount of
the rock, or by the stream of the
mountain thou liest; when the rushes are
nodding with the wind, and the mist
is flying over thee, let me approach
my love unperceived, and see him
from the rock. Lovely I saw thee
first by the aged oak; thou wert re∣turning
tall from the chace; the fairest
among thy friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>SHILRIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHAT voice is that I hear? that
voice like the summer-wind.—I sit
not by the nodding rushes; I hear not
the fount of the rock. Afar, Vinvela,
afar I go to the wars of Fingal. My
dogs attend me no more. No more
I tread the hill. No more from on
high I see thee, fair-moving by the
stream of the plain; bright as the
bow of heaven; as the moon on the
western wave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEN thou art gone, O Shilric!
and I am alone on the hill. The
deer are seen on the brow; void of
fear they graze along. No more they
dread the wind; no more the rustling
tree. The hunter is far removed;
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
he is in the field of graves. Stran∣gers!
sons of the waves! spare my
lovely Shilric.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHILRIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF fall I must in the field, raise high
my grave, Vinvela. Grey stones, and
heaped-up earth, shall mark me to future
times. When the hunter shall fit by
the mound, and produce his food at
noon, <Q REND="inline">"some warrior rests here,"</Q> he
will say; and my fame shall live in his
praise. Remember me, Vinvela, when
low on earth I lie!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VINVELA.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES!—I will remember thee—indeed
my Shilric will fall. What shall I do,
my love! when thou art gone for ever?
Through these hills I will go at noon: I
will go through the silent heath. There
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
I will see where often thou fattest return∣ing
from the chace. Indeed, my Shil∣ric
will fall; but I will remember
him.</P>
</SP>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="fragment">
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>I SIT by the mossy fountain; on the
top of the hill of winds. One tree is
rustling above me. Dark waves roll
over the heath. The lake is troubled
below. The deer descend from the
hill. No hunter at a distance is seen;
no whistling cow-herd is nigh. It is
mid-day: but all is silent. Sad are my
thoughts as I sit alone. Didst thou
but appear, O my love, a wanderer on
the heath! thy hair floating on the
wind behind thee; thy bosom heaving
on the sight; thine eyes full of tears
for thy friends, whom the mist of the
hill had concealed! Thee I would com∣fort,
my love, and bring thee to thy
father's house.</P>
<P>BUT is it she that there appears, like
a beam of light on the heath? bright
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
as the moon in autumn, as the sun in
a summer-storm?—She speaks: but
how weak her voice! like the breeze
in the reeds of the pool. Hark!</P>
<P>RETURNEST thou safe from the war?
Where are thy friends, my love? I
heard of thy death on the hill; I heard
and mourned thee, Shilric!</P>
<P>YES, my fair, I return; but I alone
of my race. Thou shalt see them no
more: their graves I raised on the plain.
But why art thou on the desert hill?
why on the heath, alone?</P>
<P>ALONE I am, O Shilric! alone in the
winter-house. With grief for thee I ex∣pired.
Shilric, I am pale in the tomb.</P>
<P>SHE fleets, she sails away; as grey
mist before the wind!—and, wilt thou
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
not stay, my love? Stay and behold
my tears? fair thou appearest, my love!
fair thou wast, when alive!</P>
<P>By the mossy fountain I will sit; on
the top of the hill of winds. When
mid-day is silent around, converse, O
my love, with me! come on the wings
of the gale! on the blast of the moun∣tain,
come! Let me hear thy voice, as
thou passest, when mid-day is silent a∣round.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="fragment">

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>EVENING is grey on the hills. The
north wind resounds through the
woods. White clouds rise on the sky: the
trembling snow descends. The river howls
afar, along its winding course. Sad,
by a hollow rock, the grey-hair'd Carryl
sat. Dry fern waves over his head; his
seat is in an aged birch. Clear to the
roaring winds he lifts his voice of woe.</P>
<P>TOSSED on the wavy ocean is He,
the hope of the isles; Malcolm, the
support of the poor; foe to the proud
in arms! Why hast thou left us behind?
why live we to mourn thy fate? We
might have heard, with thee, the voice
of the deep; have seen the oozy rock.</P>
<P>SAD on the sea-beat shore thy spouse
looketh for thy return. The time of
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
thy promise is come; the night is ga∣thering
around. But no white sail is
on the sea; no voice is heard except
the blustering winds. Low is the soul
of the war! Wet are the locks of youth!
By the foot of some rock thou liest;
washed by the waves as they come.
Why, ye winds, did ye bear him on
the desert rock? Why, ye waves, did
ye roll over him?</P>
<P>BUT, Oh! what voice is that?
Who rides on that meteor of fire! Green
are his airy limbs. It is he! it is the
ghost of Malcolm!—Rest, lovely soul,
rest on the rock; and let me hear thy
voice!—He is gone, like a dream of
the night. I see him through the trees.
Daughter of Reynold! he is gone.
Thy spouse shall return no more. No
more shall his hounds come from the
hill, forerunners of their master. No
more from the distant rock shall his
<PB REF="17"/>
voice greet thine ear. Silent is he in
the deep, unhappy daughter of Rey∣nold!</P>
<P>I will sit by the stream of the plain.
Ye rocks! hang over my head. Hear
my voice, ye trees! as ye bend on the
shaggy hill. My voice shall preserve
the praise of him, the hope of the
isles.</P>

<STAGE>CONNAL, CRIMORA,</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRIMORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHO cometh from the hill, like
a cloud tinged with the beam
of the west? Whose voice is that, loud
as the wind, but pleasant as the harp of
Carryl? It is my love in the light of
steel; but sad is his darkened brow.
Live the mighty race of Fingal? or
what disturbs my Connal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONNAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEY live. I saw them return from
the chace, like a stream of light. The
fun was on their shields: In a line they
descended the hill. Loud is the voice of
<PB REF="19"/>
the youth; the war, my love, is near.
To-morrow the enormous Dargo comes
to try the force of our race. The race of
Fingal he defies; the race of battle and
wounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRIMORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>CONNAL, I saw his sails like grey mist
on the sable wave. They came to land.
Connal, many are the warriors of
Dargo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONNAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>BRING me thy father's shield; theiron
shield of Rinval; that shield like the
full moon when it is darkened in the
sky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>CRIMORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT shield I bring, O Connal; but
it did not defend my father. By the
spear of Gauror he fell. Thou mayst
fall, O Connal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CONNAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>FALL indeed I may: But raise my
tomb, Crimora. Some stones, a mound
of earth, shall keep my memory.
Though fair thou art, my love, as the
light; more pleasant than the gale of
the hill; yet I will not stay. Raise my
tomb, Crimora.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CRIMORA.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEN give me those arms of light;
that sword, and that spear of steel. I
shall meet Dargo with thee, and aid my
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
lovely Connal. Farewell, ye rocks of
Ardven! ye deer! and ye streams of
the hill!—We shall return no more.
Our tombs are distant far.</P>

<P>AUTUMN is dark on the mountains;
grey mist rests on the hills. The
whirlwind is heard on the heath. Dark
rolls the river through the narrow plain.
A tree stands alone on the hill, and
marks the grave of Connal. The leaves
whirl round with the wind, and strew
the grave of the dead. At times are
seen here the ghosts of the deceased,
when the musing hunter alone stalks
slowly over the heath.</P>
<P>WHO can reach the source of thy
race, O Connal? and who recount thy
Fathers? Thy family grew like an oak
on the mountain, which meeteth the
wind with its lofty head. But now it
is torn from the earth. Who shall sup∣ply
the place of Connal?</P>
<P><PB REF="23"/>
HERE was the din of arms; and
here the groans of the dying. Mourn∣ful
are the wars of Fingal! O Connal!
it was here thou didst fall. Thine arm
was like a storm; thy sword, a beam
of the sky; thy height, a rock on the
plain; thine eyes, a furnace of fire.
Louder than a storm was thy voice,
when thou confoundedst the field. War∣riors
fell by thy sword, as the thistle by
the staff of a boy.</P>
<P>DARGO the mighty came on, like a
cloud of thunder. His brows were con∣tracted
and dark. His eyes like two
caves in a rock. Bright rose their
swords on each side; dire was the clang
of their steel.</P>
<P>THE daughter of Rinval was near;
Crimora, bright in the armour of man;
her hair loose behind, her bow in her
hand. She followed the youth to the
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
war, Connal her much beloved. She
drew the string on Dargo; but erring
pierced her Connal. He falls like an
oak on the plain; like a rock from the
shaggy hill. What shall she do, hap∣less
maid!—He bleeds; her Connal dies.
All the night long she cries, and all the
day, O Connal, my love, and my
friend! With grief the sad mourner
died.</P>
<P>EARTH here incloseth the loveliest
pair on the hill. The grass grows be∣tween
the stones of their tomb; I sit in
the mournful shade. The wind sighs
through the grass; and their memory
rushes on my mind. Undisturbed you
now sleep together; in the tomb of the
mountain you rest alone.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB REF="25"/>
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P>SON of the noble Fingal, Oscian,
Prince of men! what tears run down
the cheeks of age? what shades thy
mighty soul?</P>
<P>MEMORY, son of Alpin, memory
wounds the aged. Of former times are
my thoughts; my thoughts are of the
noble Fingal. The race of the king re∣turn
into my mind, and wound me with
remembrance.</P>
<P>ONE day, returned from the sport of
the mountains, from pursuing the sons
of the hill, we covered this heath with
our youth. Fingal the mighty was here,
and Oscur, my son, great in war. Fair
on our sight from the sea, at once, a
virgin came. Her breast was like the
snow of one night. Her cheek like the
<PB REF="26"/>
bud of the rose. Mild was her blue
rolling eye: but sorrow was big in her
heart.</P>
<P>FINGAL renowned in war! she cries,
sons of the king, preserve me! Speak se∣cure,
replies the king, daughter of beau∣ty,
speak: our ear is open to all: our
swords redress the injured. I fly from
Ullin, she cries, from Ullin famous in
war. I fly from the embrace of him
who would debase my blood. Cremor,
the friend of men, was my father; Cre∣mor
the Prince of Inverne.</P>
<P>FINGAL's younger sons arose; Carryl
expert in the bow; Fillan beloved of
the fair; and Fergus first in the race.—Who from the farthest Lochlyn?
who to the seas of Molochasquir? who
dares hurt the maid whom the sons of
Fingal guard? Daughter of beauty, rest
<PB REF="27"/>
secure; rest in peace, thou fairest of wo∣men.</P>
<P>FAR in the blue distance of the deep,
some spot appeared like the back of the
ridge-wave. But soon the ship increased
on our sight. The hand of Ullin drew
her to land. The mountains trembled
as he moved. The hills shook at his
steps. Dire rattled his armour around
him. Death and destruction were in his
eyes. His stature like the roe of Mor∣ven.
He moved in the lightning of
steel.</P>
<P>OUR warriours fell before him,
like the field before the reapers. Fin∣gal's
three sons he bound. He plun∣ged
his sword into the fair-one's breast.
She fell as a wreath of snow before the
sun in spring. Her bosom heaved in
death; her soul came forth in blood.</P>
<P><PB REF="28"/>
OSCUR my son came down; the
mighty in battle descended. His armour
rattled as thunder; and the lightning of
his eyes was terrible. There, was the
clashing of swords; there, was the voice
of steel. They struck and they thrust;
they digged for death with their swords.
But death was distant far, and delayed
to come. The sun began to decline;
and the cow-herd thought of home.
Then Oscur's keen steel found the heart
of Ullin. He fell like a mountain-oak
covered over with glistering frost: He
shone like a rock on the plain.—Here the daughter of beauty lieth; and
here the bravest of men. Here one
day ended the fair and the valiant.
Here rest the pursuer and the pur∣sued.</P>
<P>SON of Alpin! the woes of the aged
are many: their tears are for the past.
This raised my sorrow, warriour; me∣mory
<PB REF="29"/>
awaked my grief. Oscur my
son was brave; but Oscur is now no
more. Thou hast heard my grief, O
son of Alpin; forgive the tears of the
aged.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="fragment">
<PB REF="30"/>
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<P>WHY openest thou afresh the spring of
my grief, O son of Alpin, inquiring
how Oscur fell? My eyes are blind with
tears; but memory beams on my heart.
How can I relate the mournful death of
the head of the people! Prince of the
warriours, Oscur my son, shall I see thee
no more!</P>
<P>HE fell as the moon in a storm; as
the sun from the midst of his course,
when clouds rise from the waste of the
waves, when the blackness of the storm
inwraps the rocks of Ardannider. I, like
an ancient oak on Morven, I moulder
alone in my place. The blast hath lop∣ped
my branches away; and I tremble
at the wings of the north. Prince of
the warriors, Oscur my son! shall I see
thee no more!</P>
<P><PB REF="31"/>
DERMID and Oscur were one: They
reaped the battle together. Their
friendship was strong as their steel; and
death walked between them to the field.
They came on the foe like two rocks
falling from the brows of Ardven. Their
swords were stained with the blood of
the valiant: warriours fainted at their
names. Who was a match for Oscur,
but Dermid? and who for Dermid, but
Oscur?</P>
<P>THEY killed, mighty Dargo in the
field; Dargo before invincible. His
daughter was fair as the morn; mild
as the beam of night. Her eyes, like
two stars in a shower: her breath, the
gale of spring: her breasts, as the new-fallen
snow floating on the moving heath.
The warriours saw her, and loved; their
souls were fixed on the maid. Each
loved her, as his fame; each must pos∣sess
her or die. But her soul was fixed
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
on Oscur; my son was the youth of
her love. She forgot the blood of her
father; and loved the hand that slew
him.</P>
<P>SON of Oscian, said Dermid, I love;
O Oscur, I love this maid. But her
soul cleaveth unto thee; and nothing
can heal Dermid. Here, pierce this
bosom, Oscur; relieve me, my friend,
with thy sword.</P>
<P>MY sword, son of Morny, shall ne∣ver
be stained with the blood of Der∣mid.</P>
<P>WHO then is worthy to slay me, O
Oscur son of Oscian? Let not my life
pass away unknown. Let none but Os∣cur
slay me. Send me with honour to
the grave, and let my death be renown∣ed.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33"/>
DERMID, make use of thy sword;
son of Morny, wield thy steel. Would
that I fell with thee! that my death
came from the hand of Dermid!</P>
<P>THEY sought by the brook of the
mountain; by the streams of Branno.
Blood tinged the silvery stream, and
crudled round the mossy stones. Der∣mid
the graceful fell; fell, and smiled in
death.</P>
<P>AND fallest thou, son of Morny;
fallest thou by Oscur's hand! Dermid
invincible in war, thus do I see thee fall!—He went, and returned to the maid
whom he loved; returned, but she per∣ceived
his grief.</P>
<P>WHY that gloom, son of Oscian?
what shades thy mighty soul?</P>
<P>THOUGH once renowned for the bow,
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
O maid, I have lost my same. Fixed on
a tree by the brook of the hill, is the
shield of Gormur the brave, whom in
battle I slew. I have wasted the day
in vain, nor could my arrow pierce it.</P>
<P>LET me try, son of Oscian, the skill
of Dargo's daughter. My hands were
taught the bow: my father delighted in
my skill.</P>
<P>SHE went. He stood behind the
shield. Her arrow flew and pierced his
breast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing was held by the ancient Highlanders more essential to their glory, than to die by the hand of some person worthy or renowned. This was the occasion of Oscur's contriving to be slain by his mistress, now that he was weary of life. In those early times suicide was utterly unknown among that people, and no traces of it are found in the old poetry. Whence the translator suspects the account that follows of the daughter of Dargo killing herself, to be the interpola∣tion of some later Bard.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
BLESSED be that hand of snow; and
blessed thy bow of yew! I fall resolved
on death: and who but the daughter of
Dargo was worthy to slay me? Lay me
in the earth, my fair-one; lay me by
the side of Dermid.</P>
<P>OSCUR! I have the blood, the soul
of the mighty Dargo. Well pleased I
can meet death. My sorrow I can end
thus.—She pierced her white bosom
with steel. She fell; she trembled; and
died.</P>
<P>BY the brook of the hill their graves
are laid; a birch's unequal shade covers
their tomb. Often on their green earth∣en
tombs the branchy sons of the moun∣tain
feed, when mid-day is all in flames,
and silence is over all the hills.</P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P>BY the side of a rock on the hill, be∣neath
the aged trees, old Oscian
fat on the moss; the last of the race of
Fingal. Sightless are his aged eyes;
his beard is waving in the wind. Dull
through the leafless trees he heard the
voice of the north. Sorrow revived in
his soul: he began and lamented the
dead.</P>
<P>How hast thou fallen like an oak,
with all thy branches round thee! Where
is Fingal the King? where is Oscur my
son? where are all my race? Alas! in
the earth they lie. I feel their tombs
with my hands. I hear the river below
murmuring hoarsely over the stones.
What dost thou, O river, to me? Thou
bringest back the memory of the past.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
THE race of Fingal stood on thy
banks, like a wood in a fertile soil.
Keen were their spears of steel. Hardy
was he who dared to encounter their
rage. Fillan the great was there. Thou
Oscur wert there, my son! Fingal him∣self

of years. Full rose his sinewy limbs;
and wide his shoulders spread. The
unhappy met with his arm, when the
pride of his wrath arose.</P>
<P>THE son of Morny came; Gaul, the
tallest of men. He stood on the hill like
an oak; his voice was like the streams of
the hill. Why reigneth alone, he cries,
the son of the mighty Corval? Fingal is
not strong to save: he is no support for
the people. I am strong as a storm in
the ocean; as a whirlwind on the hill.
Yield, son of Corval; Fingal, yield to
me.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
OSCUR stood forth to meet him;
my son would meet the foe. But Fin∣gal
came in his strength, and smiled at
the vaunter's boast. They threw their
arms round each other; they struggled
on the plain. The earth is ploughed with
their heels. Their bones crack as the boat
on the ocean, when it leaps from wave to
wave. Long did they toil; with night,
they fell on the sounding plain; as two
oaks, with their branches mingled, fall
crashing from the hill. The tall son
of Morny is bound; the aged over∣came.</P>
<P>FAIR with her locks of gold, her
smooth neck, and her breasts of snow;
fair, as the spirits of the hill when at
silent noon they glide along the heath;
fair, as the rain-bow of heaven; came
Minvane the maid. Fingal! she soft∣ly
saith, loose me my brother Gaul.
Loose me the hope of my race, the ter∣ror
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
of all but Fingal. Can I, replies the
King, can I deny the lovely daughter
of the hill? take thy brother, O Min∣vane,
thou fairer than the snow of the
north!</P>
<P>SUCH, Fingal! were thy words; but
thy words I hear no more. Sightless
I sit by thy tomb. I hear the wind in
the wood; but no more I hear my
friends. The cry of the hunter is over.
The voice of war is ceased.</P>

<P>THOU askest, fair daughter of the
isles! whose memory is preserved
in these tombs? The memory of Ron∣nan
the bold, and Connan the chief of
men; and of her, the fairest of maids,
Rivine the lovely and the good. The
wing of time is laden with care. Every
moment hath woes of its own. Why
seek we our grief from afar? or give our
tears to those of other times? But thou
commandest, and I obey, O fair daugh∣ter
of the isles!</P>
<P>CONAR was mighty in war. Caul
was the friend of strangers. His gates
were open to all; midnight darkened
not on his barred door. Both lived upon
the sons of the mountains. Their bow
was the support of the poor.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41"/>
CONNAN was the image of Conar's
soul. Caul was renewed in Ronnan his
son. Rivine the daughter of Conar was
the love of Ronnan; her brother Con∣nan
was his friend. She was fair as the
harvest-moon setting in the seas of Molo∣chasquir.
Her soul was settled on Ron∣nan;
the youth was the dream of her
nights.</P>
<P>RIVINE, my love! says Ronnan, I go
to my king in Norway<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supposed to be Fergus II. This fragment is rec∣koned not altogether so ancient as most of the rest.</NOTE>. A year and
a day shall bring me back. Wilt thou
be true to Ronnan?</P>
<P>RONNAN! a year and a day I will
spend in sorrow. Ronnan, behave like
a man, and my soul shall exult in thy
valour. Connan my friend, says Ron∣nan,
wilt thou preserve Rivine thy si∣ster?
Durstan is in love with the maid;
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
and soon shall the sea bring the stran∣ger
to our coast.</P>
<P>RONNAN, I will defend: Do thou
securely go.—He went. He return∣ed
on his day. But Durstan returned
before him.</P>
<P>GIVE me thy daughter, Conar, says
Durstan; or fear and feel my power.</P>
<P>HE who dares attempt my sister, says
Connan, must meet this edge of steel.
Unerring in battle is my arm: my
sword, as the lightning of heaven.</P>
<P>RONNAN the warriour came; and
much he threatened Durstan.</P>
<P>BUT, faith Euran the servant of
gold, Ronnan! by the gate of the north
shall Durstan this night carry thy fair∣one
away. Accursed, answers Ron∣nan,
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
be this arm if death meet him not
there.</P>
<P>CONNAN! faith Euran, this night
shall the stranger carry thy sister away.
My sword shall meet him, replies Con∣nan,
and he shall lie low on earth.</P>
<P>THE friends met by night, and they
sought. Blood and sweat ran down
their limbs as water on the mossy rock.
Connan falls; and cries, O Durstan,
be favourable to Rivine!—And is it my
friend, cries Ronnan, I have slain? O
Connan! I knew thee not.</P>
<P>HE went, and he fought with Dur∣stan.
Day began to rise on the com∣bat,
when fainting they fell, and expi∣red.
Rivine came out with the morn;
and—O what detains my Ronnan!—She saw him lying pale in his blood;
and her brother lying pale by his side.
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
What could she say? what could she
do? her complaints were many and vain.
She opened this grave for the warri∣ours;
and fell into it herself, before it
was closed; like the sun snatched away
in a storm.</P>
<P>THOU hast heard this tale of grief,

fair as thyself: shed on her grave a

<P>IT is night; and I am alone, forlorn
on the hill of storms. The wind is
heard in the mountain. The torrent
shrieks down the rock. No hut receives
me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of
winds.</P>
<P>RISE, moon! from behind thy
clouds; stars of the night, appear!
Lead me, some light, to the place where
my love rests from the toil of the chace!
his bow near him, unstrung; his dogs
panting around him. But here I must
sit alone, by the rock of the mossy
stream. The stream and the wind
roar; nor can I hear the voice of my
love.</P>
<P>WHY delayeth my Shalgar, why the
son of the hill, his promise? Here is
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
the rock; and the tree; and here the
roaring stream. Thou promisedst with
night to be here. Ah! whither is my
Shalgar gone? With thee I would fly
my father; with thee, my brother of
pride. Our race have long been foes;
but we are not foes, O Shalgar!</P>
<P>CEASE a little while, O wind! stream,
be thou silent a while! let my voice be
heard over the heath; let my wanderer
hear me. Shalgar! it is I who call. Here
is the tree, and the rock. Shalgar, my
love! I am here. Why delayest thou
thy coming? Alas! no answer.</P>
<P>Lo! the moon appeareth. The
flood is bright in the vale. The rocks
are grey on the face of the hill. But
I see him not on the brow; his dogs
before him tell not that he is coming.
Here I must sit alone.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
BUT who are these that lie beyond
me on the heath? Are they my love
and my brother?—Speak to me, O my
friends! they answer not. My soul is
tormented with fears.—Ah! they are
dead. Their swords are red from the
fight. O my brother! my brother!
why hast thou slain my Shalgar? why,
O Shalgar! hast thou slain my brother?
Dear were ye both to me! speak to me;
hear my voice, sons of my love! But
alas! they are silent; silent for ever!
Cold are their breasts of clay!</P>
<P>OH! from the rock of the hill;
from the top of the mountain of winds,
speak ye ghosts of the dead! speak,
and I will not be afraid.—Whither
are ye gone to rest? In what cave of
the hill shall I find you?</P>
<P>I sit in my grief. I wait for morn∣ing
in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye

friends of the dead; but close it not
till I come. My life flieth away like a
dream: why should I stay behind?
Here shall I rest with my friends by the
stream of the sounding rock. When
night comes on the hill; when the wind
is up on the heath; my ghost shall stand
in the wind, and mourn the death of
my friends. The hunter shall hear
from his booth. He shall sear, but

<P>SAD! I am sad indeed: nor small my

lost no son; thou hast lost no daugh∣ter

and Annir the fairest of maids. The
boughs of thy family flourish, O Kir∣mor!
but Armyn is the last of his
race.</P>
<P>RISE, winds of autumn, rise; blow
upon the dark heath! streams of the
mountains, roar! howl, ye tempests,
in the trees! walk through broken
clouds, O moon! show by intervals thy
pale face! bring to my mind that sad
night, when all my children fell; when
Arindel the mighty fell; when Daura
the lovely died.</P>
<P>DAURA, my daughter! thou wert
<PB REF="50"/>
fair; fair as the moon on the hills of
Jura; white as the driven snow; sweet as
the breathing gale. Armor renowned in
war came, and sought Daura's love; he
was not long denied; fair was the hope
of their friends.</P>
<P>EARCH son of Odgal repined; for
his brother was slain by Armor. He
came disguised like a son of the sea:
fair was his skiff on the wave; white
his locks of age; calm his serious brow.
Fairest of women, he said, lovely daugh∣ter
of Armyn! a rock not distant in
the sea, bears a tree on its side; red
shines the fruit afar. There Armor
waiteth for Daura. I came to fetch
his love. Come, fair daughter of Ar∣myn!</P>
<P>SHE went; and she called on Armor.
Nought answered, but the son of the
rock. Armor, my love! my love!
<PB REF="51"/>
why tormentest thou me with fear?
come, graceful son of Ardnart, come;
it is Daura who calleth thee!—Earch
the traitor fled laughing to the land.
She lifted up her voice, and cried for
her brother and her father. Arindel!
Armyn! none to relieve your Daura?</P>
<P>HER voice came over the sea. Arin∣del
my son descended from the hill;
rough in the spoils of the chace. His
arrows rattled by his side; his bow was
in his hand; five grey dogs attended
his steps. He saw fierce Earch on the
shore; he seized and bound him to an
oak. Thick fly the thongs of the hide
around his limbs; he loads the wind
with his groans.</P>
<P>ARINDEL ascends the surgy deep in
his boat, to bring Daura to the land.
Armor came in his wrath, and let fly
the grey-feathered shaft. It sung; it
<PB REF="52"/>
sunk in thy heart, O Arindel my son!
for Earch the traitor thou diedst. What
is thy grief, O Daura, when round
thy feet is poured thy brother's blood!</P>
<P>THE boat is broken in twain by the
waves. Armor plunges into the sea, to
rescue his Daura or die. Sudden a blast
from the hill comes over the waves.
He sunk, and he rose no more.</P>
<P>ALONE, on the sea-beat rock, my
daughter was heard to complain. Fre∣quent
and loud were her cries; nor
could her father relieve her. All
night I stood on the shore. All night I
heard her cries. Loud was the wind;
and the rain beat hard on the side of the
mountain. Before morning appeared,
her voice was weak. It died away, like
the evening-breeze among the grass of
the rocks. Spent with grief she expired.
O lay me soon by her side.</P>
<P><PB REF="53"/>
WHEN the storms of the mountain
come; when the north lifts the waves
on high; I sit by the founding shore,
and look on the fatal rock. Often by
the setting moon I see the ghosts of
my children. Indistinct, they walk in
mournful conference together. Will
none of you speak to me?—But they
do not regard their father.</P>

<P>THE wind and the rain are over:

the green hills flies the inconstant sun.
Red through the stony vale comes
down the stream of the hill. Sweet are
thy murmurs, O stream! but more
sweet is the voice I hear. It is the voice
of Alpin the son of the song, mourning
for the dead. Bent is his head of age,

<P>MY tears, O Ryno! are for the dead;

among the sons of the plain. But thou
shalt fall like Morar; and the mourner
shalt sit on thy tomb. The hills shall
know thee no more; thy bow shall lie in
the hall, unstrung.</P>
<P>THOU wert swift, O Morar! as a
roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of
fire. Thy wrath was as the storm of
December. Thy sword in battle, as
lightning in the field. Thy voice was
like a stream after rain; like thunder
on distant hills. Many fell by thy
arm; they were consumed in the flames
of thy wrath.</P>
<P>BUT when thou returnedst from war,
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face
was like the sun after rain; like the
moon in the silence of night; calm as
the breast of the lake when the loud
wind is laid.</P>
<P>NARROW is thy dwelling now; dark
the place of thine abode. With three
steps I compass thy grave, O thou who
wast so great before! Four stones with
their heads of moss are the only memo∣rial
of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf,
long grass which whistles in the wind,
mark to the hunter's eye the grave of
the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art
low indeed. Thou hast no mother to
mourn thee; no maid with her tears of
love. Dead is she that brought thee
forth. Fallen is the daughter of Mor∣glan.</P>
<P>WHO on his staff is this? who is this,
whose head is white with age, whose
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
eyes are red with tears, who quakes
at every step?—It is thy father, O
Morar! the father of none but thee.
He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard
of foes dispersed. He heard of Morar's
fame; why did he not hear of his
wound? Weep, thou father of Morar!
weep; but thy son heareth thee not.
Deep is the sleep of the dead; low their
pillow of dust. No more shall he hear
thy voice; no more shall he awake at
thy call. When shall it be morn in the
grave, to bid the slumberer awake?</P>
<P>FAREWELL, thou bravest of men!
thou conqueror in the field! but the field
shall see thee no more; nor the dark
wood be lightened with the splendor of
thy steel. Thou hast left no son.
But the song shall preserve thy name.

Garve. Once we wrestled on the hill.
Our heels overturned the wood. Rocks
fell from their place, and rivulets chan∣ged

<P>No. I will never yield to man.
