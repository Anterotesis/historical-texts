<HEAD>THE LAST WILL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN. I <HI>Alexander Pope,</HI> of <HI>Twickenham,</HI> in the County of <HI>Middle∣sex,</HI> make this my last Will and Testa∣ment. I resign my Soul to it's Creator
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
in all humble Hope of it's future Hap∣piness, as in the Disposal of a Being in∣finitely Good. As to my Body, my Will is, That it be buried near the Mo∣nument of my dear Parents at <HI>Twicken∣ham,</HI> with the Addition, after the Words <HI>filius fecit</HI>—of these only, <HI>Et sibi: Qui obiit Anno</HI> 17. <HI>Aetatis</HI>—and that it be carried to the Grave by six of the poorest Men of the Parish, to each of whom I order a Suit of Grey course Cloth, as Mourning. If I happen to die at any inconvenient Distance, let the same be done in any other Parish, and the Inscription be added on the Monument at <HI>Twickenham.</HI> I hereby make and appoint my particular Friends,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<HI>Allen</HI> Lord <HI>Bathurst; Hugh</HI> Earl of <HI>Marchmont;</HI> the Honourable <HI>William Murray,</HI> his Majesty's Solicitor Gene∣ral; and <HI>George Arbuthnott,</HI> of the Court of <HI>Exchequer,</HI> Esq; the Survivors or Survivor of them, Executors of this my last Will and Testament.</P>
<P>But all the Manuscript and unprinted Papers which I shall leave at my De∣cease, I desire may be delivered to my Noble Friend, <HI>Henry St. John,</HI> Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> to whose sole Care and Judgment I commit them, either to be preserved or destroyed; or in case he shall not survive me, to the abovesaid Earl of <HI>Marchmont.</HI> These, who in the
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
Course of my Life have done me all other good Offices, will not refuse me this last after my Death: I leave them therefore this Trouble, as a Mark of my Trust and Friendship; only desiring them each to accept of some small Memorial of me: That my Lord <HI>Bo∣lingbroke</HI> will add to his Library all the Volumes of my Works and Translations of <HI>Homer,</HI> bound in red Morocco, and the Eleven Volumes of those of <HI>Eras∣mus:</HI> That my Lord <HI>Marchmont</HI> will take the large Paper Edition of <HI>Thuanus,</HI> by <HI>Buckley;</HI> and that Portrait of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> by <HI>Richardson;</HI> which he shall prefer: That my Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI> will find a Place for the three Statues
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
of the <HI>Hercules</HI> of <HI>Furnese,</HI> the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Medicis,</HI> and the <HI>Apollo</HI> in <HI>Chiaro os∣curo,</HI> done by <HI>Kneller:</HI> That Mr. <HI>Mur∣ray</HI> will accept of the Marble Head of <HI>Homer,</HI> by <HI>Bernini;</HI> and of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> by <HI>Guelfi;</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Ar∣buthnot</HI> will take the Watch I com∣monly wore, which the King of <HI>Sar∣dinia</HI> gave to the late Earl of <HI>Peterbo∣row,</HI> and he to me on his Death-Bed; together with one of the Pictures of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I desire Mr. <HI>Lyttelton</HI> to accept of the Busts of <HI>Spencer, Shakespear, Milton,</HI> and <HI>Dryden,</HI> in Marble, which his Royal Master the Prince, was pleased
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
to give me. I give and devise my Li∣brary of printed Books to <HI>Ralph Allen,</HI> of <HI>Widcombe,</HI> Esq; and to the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Warburton,</HI> or to the Sur∣vivor of them (when those belonging to Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> are taken out, and when Mrs. <HI>Martha Blount</HI> has chosen Threescore out of the Number) I also give and bequeath to the said Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> the Property of all such of my Works already Printed, as he hath written, or shall write Commentaries or Notes upon, and which I have not otherwise disposed of, or alienated; and all the Profits which shall arise after my Death from such Editions as he

If he refuse to take this him∣self, I desire him to employ it in a Way I am persuaded he will not dis∣like, to the Benefit of the <HI>Bath</HI>-Ho∣spital.</P>
<P>I give and devise to my Sister-in-law, Mrs. <HI>Magdalen Racket,</HI> the Sum of Three
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>

<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
Goods, Chattels, Plate, or whatever is not otherwise disposed of in this my Will, I give and devise to the said Mrs. <HI>Martha Blount,</HI> out of a sincere Regard, and long Friendship for her: And it is my Will, that my abovesaid Executors, the Survivors or Survivor of them, shall take an Account of all my Estate, Mo∣ney, or Bonds, &amp;c. and after paying my Debts and Legacies, shall place out all the Residue upon Government, or other Secu∣rities, according to their best Judgment; and pay the Produce thereof, half-yearly, to the said Mrs. <HI>Martha Blount,</HI> during her natural Life: And after her Decease, I give the Sum of One thousand Pounds to Mrs. <HI>Magdalen Racket,</HI> and her Sons
