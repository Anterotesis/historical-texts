<HEAD>A Declaration of TRUTH
TO
<HI>Benjamin Hoadly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BE it known unto thee, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that albeit we, who are the People of
the Lord, own thee not in thy proud
Titles, neither in thy Office, as thou exerci∣sest
the same; neither can we treat thee with
that Distinction wherewith Men distinguish
thee, forasmuch as we do not acknowledge
the same (as thou dost) to be of God: Ne∣vertheless
I shall treat thee respectfully in
this thing, whereof I am now to commune
with thee, seeing thou hast uttered much
Truth with thy Mouth, and therefore hast
moved much Wrath of wicked Men against
thee.</P>
<P>And would'st thou, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> faithfully
pursue the Light which I perceive is in thee,
and which shineth abroad far and nigh; I
say, would'st thou act according to the Light
which I plainly see is in thee, thou should'st
have Praise; for thou hast verily <HI>done wor∣thily,</HI>
in that thou hast restored the King∣dom
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
to them to whom it solely appertaineth,
and hast dethroned the Usurpations of wic∣ked
Men, who have unrighteously set them∣selves
up in the Throne of Jesus.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou hast done worthi∣ly,
in that thou hast appeared for the Cause
of our God against the Unrighteousness of
Men; and hast not been afraid, neither dis∣couraged,
when they have risen up against
thee with great Wrath: And I am sent unto
thee to declare in words of Seriousness, that
thou should'st not faint, neither be dismay'd,
for that many of the Faithful Servants of
God are with thee in this thing, and do say
unto thee <HI>God speed,</HI> which thou knowest
we are forbidden to say unto the ungodly,
and unto Men who are not led in the right
way.</P>
<P>Having thus given my Testimony to thy
good Works, I communicated my Intentions
to Friends: Among these, <HI>Aminadab,</HI> a
righteous Man, fearing not the Face of Men,
but fearing God only, <HI>saith unto thee,</HI> that
his Heart is likewise with thee in the things
which thou hast said; <HI>to wit,</HI> That the Power
of Men, or the Laws of Men, have no Au∣thority
to interfere with, or to join their
Power with the Right Hand of Jesus, who
allows no Partners in the Throne of his
Glorious Kingdom on Earth, any more than
he will admit Partners in the Throne of his
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Glorisy'd Kingdom in Heaven. Moreover,
he hath sent Messengers unto me, saying,
Speak thou <HI>Ebenezer</HI> in the Ears of <HI>Benjamin
Hoadly,</HI> and say unto him, Fear not the Face
of Men, tho' many rise up against thee, say∣ing,
Thou lyest, thou lyest; for verily thou
lyest not <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but hast spoken the
Truth, and it shall prevail.</P>
<P><HI>Aaron,</HI> a Man filled with Knowledge, and
a Teacher of Wisdom, sent also unto me,
saying, <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> the thing which <HI>Aminadab</HI>
our Friend hath communicated unto thee
concerning <HI>Benjamin Hoadly,</HI> are things
which savour of Truth; and thou wilt do
well to speak unto the said <HI>Benjamin,</HI> say∣ing,
Fear not <HI>Benjamin,</HI> for wise Men are
with thee, and good Men are with thee; and
verily they be better Men, and more in num∣ber,
that are with thee than those that be
against thee.</P>
<P>I might name unto thee many Friends, en∣dowed
with Wisdom and Knowledge, who
speak well of thee, for that thou hast spoken
the Truth with great boldness, and hast not
feared to utter it, even in the hearing of the
King, and we may not doubt but that our
Lord the King will be thy strong Helper a∣gainst
all thine Enemies, and will assist thee
to silence the Gain-sayers of thy Doctrine;
for verily, the King is an unfeigned Friend
unto the Truth, and would be willing that
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
all Men should walk in the path to Heaven,
howbeit he may not be inlightned equal to
our Friends, which nevertheless we hope he
may hereafter be, if God seeth it good to
bring his Heart over unto us.</P>
<P>And albeit Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou art not
yet joined unto the faithful Servants of God
our Friends, but that thou for a little while
remainest, as to some things, in the Darkness
of the World; yet forasmuch as thou join∣est
with us in the Truth, we embrace thee
willingly, nothing doubting but that the
Heavenly Light which has shone out in thy
Word, will hereafter shine in thy Heart,
and thou wilt come over more perfectly un∣to
us Friends, who are already established in
the Truth.</P>
<P>And I am the farther confirm'd in the truth
hereof, in that thou hast so boldly acknow∣ledged
the Truths of God, being the same
professed by us, and for the sake whereof
we are inclin'd to think well of thee; and
seeing I have informed thee that thou hast
so exactly taught what we in Principle be∣lieve,
and closely adhere to in Practice, I
shall let thee know, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> how exactly
thou agreest with us who have received the
Truth, and that we hold and believe all the
Truths that thou hast taught, and that also
even in the same words in which thou hast
declared them, or but with small variation
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
thereof, as thou wilt farther be informed,
when thou shalt read the following Heads,
which are part of <HI>the Principles of Truth,
or of those things about Doctrine, which we
Friends do most surely believe and recieve;</HI> to
wit,</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P><HI>Concerning Religion, we believe, that it is
only the Spirit of the Lord that makes Men
truly Religious; and no Man ought to be com∣pelled
to or from any exercise or practice in Re∣ligion,
by any outward Law or Power, but every
Man ought to be left free, as the Lord shall
perswade his own mind, in doing, or leaving un∣done
this or the other practice in Religion; and
every Man of what Profession in Religion so∣ever,
ought to be protected in Peace; provided
himself be a Man of Peace, not seeking the wrong
of any Man's Person or Estate.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That to reprove false Opini∣ons
and unsound Doctrines and Principles seek∣ing
to convince them that oppose themselves, by
Exhortation or sharp Reproof, by word or wri∣ting,
ought not to be counted a breach of the
Peace; or to strive about the things of the King∣dom
of God, by Men of contrary Minds or Judg∣ments,
this ought not to be punished by the Ma∣gistrates
and their Laws: for we believe that
the outward Laws and Powers of the Earth are
only to preserve Mens Persons and Estates, and
not to preserve Men in Opinions: neither ought
the Laws of the Nation to be laid upon Mens</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>Consciences, to bind them to or from such a
Judgment or Practice in Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That Christ is, and ought only
to be Lord and Exerciser of Mens Consciences,
and his Spirit must only lead into all Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And we believe, That Obedience and Subje∣tion
in the Lord belongs to Superiors, and that
Subjects ought to obey them [in the Lord] that
have rule over them: and that Children ought
to obey their Parents, and Wives their Hus∣bands,
and Servants their Masters in all things,
which is according to God, which stand in the
exercise of a pure Conscience towards God: But
where Rulers, Parents or Masters, or any other,
command or require Subjection in any thing
which is contrary to God, or not according to
him, in such cases all People are free, and ought
to obey God rather than Man; and we believe,
that herein God will justifie them, being guided
and led by his Spirit in all that which is good,
and out of all that which is evil.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Herein, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou mayest see,
as in a Vision of clear Light, that thou art
in the same way of Truth with us, and I
have Freedom to own thee therein; for ve∣rily
thou hast clearly testified unto <HI>the Truth
which we believe,</HI> in that thou hast likewise
said, even in our Words, <HI>That every Man
ought to be left free as the Lord shall perswade
his own Mind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Now <HI>Benjamin</HI> let it not seem strange un∣to
thee, that I say unto thee, that these are
our own Words; for I speak therein with
Truth and Soberness, referring thee for
Testimony thereof unto a little Book pub∣lished
more than Forty and Five Years since,
by a Body of our Friends, and Signed by
<HI>John Crook,</HI> a Man endowed with a Spirit of
a sound Mind, and also by three other Anci∣ents,
who were likewise Men of true Wisdom.
This Book is Entituled, <HI>Truth's Principles,</HI>
&amp;c. in which Book the Words which I have
written unto thee above, are to be found.</P>
<P>Searching likewise thy Book, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
which thou hast made Publick, by the Com∣mand
of the King, I find these Words, which
I hope thou hast learned from our Friends
above written; to wit, That the Language
of the Word is, <HI>That knowing the Terrors of
the Lord, we</HI> should <HI>perswade Men;</HI> but that
the Language of the Mens Conduct, who
profess to succeed Him that Taught the o∣ther,
is, That having the Terrors of this
World in their power, they do not perswade
Men, but <HI>force their outward Profession against
their inward Perswasion.</HI></P>
<P>Verily thou hast spoken, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as one
having the Light of the Spirit; and this is a
Truth which the Men of the World cannot
be able to resist. Verily, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
we agree with thee, that the Kingdom of
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Jesus is not of this World, and that the
Laws of his Kingdom likewise, and the Re∣wards
and Punishments of those Laws, are
suited to the end of those Laws, and to the
Nature of his Kingdom: Nay, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I will
use thy Words as thou hast used the Words
of wise Men, who went before thee; to wit,
<Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Laws</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> therefore, as
<HI>Christ</HI> left them, have nothing of <HI>this</HI>
World in their view; not Tendency, either
to the Exaltation of <HI>Some,</HI> in wordly
Pomp and Dignity; or to their absolute
Dominion over the Faith and Religious
conduct of <HI>Others</HI> of his Subjects; or to
the erecting of any sort of <HI>Temporal King∣dom,</HI>
under the Covert of Name of a <HI>Spi∣ritual</HI>
One."<P>"The <HI>Sanctions</HI> of <HI>Christ's Law</HI> are <HI>Re∣wards</HI>
and <HI>Punishments.</HI> But of what
sort? Not the Rewards of this Worlds;
not the Offices, or Glories, of this State;
not the Pains of <HI>Prisons, Banishments,
Fines,</HI> or any lesser and more <HI>moderate Pe∣nalties;</HI>
nay, not the much lesser <HI>Negative
Discouragements</HI> that belong to <HI>Humane
Society. He</HI> was far from thinking that
<HI>These</HI> could be the Instruments of such a
<HI>Perswasion,</HI> as He thought acceptable to
God. But, as the Great End of his
<HI>Kingdom,</HI> was to guide Men to Happiness,
after the short Images of it were over
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
here below; so, he took his <HI>Motives</HI>
from that place where his <HI>Kingdom</HI> first
began, and where it was at last to end;
from those <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Punishments</HI> in
a future State, which had no relation to
this World: And to shew that his <HI>King∣dom
was not of this World,</HI> all the <HI>Sanctions</HI>
which He thought fit to give to <HI>His Laws,</HI>
were <HI>not of this World</HI> at all."</P></Q></P>
<P>I confirm these thy Positions and Doc∣trines,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> with my Voice, and give
thee Praise therefore, for verily thou art wor∣thy
of Praise, not only that thou hast spoken
boldly the Truth, but for that thou hast
done it in the Face of the Adversary, and
hast not been afraid. And Blessed be the
King, into whose Heart God hath put it to
Frown upon the Gainsayers; and albeit they
were gathered together against thee, he hath
seattered them, and hath sent them away dis∣couraged.</P>
<P>Neither
do I flatter thee with my Lips;
for Friends are not Guilty of such things,
and it would be in me a great Iniquity; but
I speak to thee in Sincerity and in Truth,
and my Thoughts are moved to utter the
Words of my Mouth; for verily thou hast
dethroned and pulled down that Man of Sin,
the <HI>Son of Perdition,</HI> which <HI>has Exalted him∣self;</HI>
thou hast valintly Encountred the
Tribe of ungodly Priests, who have by an
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Injurious Usage of the Lord's People, for
many Years usurped the Authority of King
Jesus, and have exercised Dominion over the
Souls who they have had committed by Men
unto their Charge; these they have Tyranni∣zed
over, and have Cruelly Persecuted un∣der
pretence of Authority from Jesus; albeit
Jesus the true King and only Head of all true
Believers, as thou hast well said, hath given
no such Authority unto them.</P>
<P>Now concerning Ministers I will tell thee
what Friends do surely Receive and Believe,
and I will not give thee my own words, but
the words of the said Declaration of <HI>Truth's
Principles</HI> mention'd before; to wit,</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>"Such Ministers as are made by God, who
are sanctified by his Word and Power, who
have freely received perfect Gifts from
God, and so by the Spirit and Power of
God are sent forth into the World, to turn
the People from Darkness to Light, and
from the Power of Satan to the Power of
God; who freely Minister unto others,
without coveting any Man's Gold, or Sil∣ver,
or Apparel; not seeking theirs, but
them: Warning every Man and teaching
every Man in all Wisdom, that they might
present every Man perfect in Christ Jesus:
such as minister from the Spirit, and have
the Word of God abiding in them; who
are never unprovided, but at all times and
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
seasons, and in all places, do speak and
declare the Truth, as they are moved and
instructed, and as the Spirit of Truth doth
give them utterance; Such Ministers we
own, and have in great esteem."</P></Q>
<P>This we surely do Believe, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and
thou hast done worthily in concurring with
us, and in that thou hast taken away from
those who call themselves <HI>Ministers,</HI> all that
Power and pretended Authority which they
assume, and which we say they usurp contra∣ry
to the Nature of the Office of a Minister,
which we also Declare to be only to Teach
and Instruct, not to Terrify and Affright the
People of the Lord; and herein we know,
that altho' thou wilt offend them, and they
will shew great Wrath against thee therefore;
yet, <HI>I say,</HI> we know thou hast spoken the
Truth against them, and I concur with thee
therein; nay I acknowledge thee and own
thee therein, because thou hast concurred
with us in the Truth, not doubting but thou
wilt be farther inlightned, in the Lord's due
time, to joyn with Friends in all the words
of Truth which we Profess.</P>
<P>I must farther say in thy behalf, Friend
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> that thou hast spoken Excellent
words of Wisdom in defiance of the Men of
high Notions, who are of the Tribe who thou
didst belong to in former time; for thou hast
taken the People out of their hands, and hast
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
set them free from the mock Terrors of Vain
Men, such as they call the Artillery of the
Church; which we that know the ways of
Truth, are acquainted with the Deceitfulness
of; and as I Glory in thy Words thereupon,
I shall repeat them in thy Praise as followeth,
to wit,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Not the least Tittle of Salvation or
Damnation depends upon the Will of weak
Men, but all upon God and your selves;
Humane Benedictions, Humane Absoluti∣ons,
Humane Denunciations, Humane Ex∣communications,
have nothing to do with
the Favour or Anger of God: But are Hu∣mane
Engins, permitted to work (<HI>like o∣ther
Evils</HI>) by Providence."</Q></P>
<P>These are Excellent Things spoken with
Wisdom, and thou shalt have due Praise of
the same: Likewise hast thou Batter'd down
the strong Holds of Satan, in thy Words on
the same Subject.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"In all your <HI>Religious Concerns,</HI> that ef∣fect
your Eternal Salvation, and your <HI>Title</HI>
to <HI>God's Favour,</HI> your <HI>Rule</HI> is plain and
evident <HI>Christ</HI> is your sole Law-giver, and
your sole Judge, as to those Points. The
<HI>Papists</HI> may <HI>Excommunicate</HI> the <HI>Protestant
Non jurors</HI>: The <HI>Non-jurors</HI> may <HI>Excom∣municate
the High-Church-Men,</HI> as well as
all other <HI>British Protestants,</HI> who pray for
King <HI>GEORGE</HI>: These again may
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>Excommunicate, Ʋnchurch, Ʋnchristian,</HI>
those whose <HI>Church-Government,</HI> or <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI>
differ from their own; and <HI>these</HI> a∣gain
may Exercise the same <HI>Spiritual Dis∣cipline,</HI>
wherever their <HI>Terrors</HI> can extend
themselves: They may thus scatter <HI>Dam∣nation</HI>
about; Playing, one would think,
as the <HI>Man</HI> in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> with <HI>Fire∣brands</HI>
and <HI>Death,</HI> and saying, <HI>Are we
not in Sport;</HI> and they may every one
Flatter <HI>themselves,</HI> that this <HI>Power of the
Keys</HI> shuts out from the <HI>Catholick Church</HI>
here, and from the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI>
hereafter: But it is in truth only from
<HI>themselves</HI> that they can <HI>Excommunicate</HI>:
And this is very often their own <HI>Crime,</HI>
and their own <HI>Loss:</HI> but <HI>Christ</HI> himself and
his <HI>Apostles</HI> have plainly told you <HI>what</HI> it
is, and <HI>what</HI> alone that shall cut you off
from <HI>him;</HI> and Declared a Curse upon <HI>all</HI>
who <HI>Preach any other Gospel;</HI> and conse∣quently,
who add any thing as absolutely
necessary to his Favour, which he hath not
made so."</Q></P>
<P>To these Truths of thine, such I call them,
as thou hast been honoured to speak them
first among Men, I bear my Testimony, and
the good People, the People of the Lord,
despised by Men, of whom I am the
meanest, have born their Testimony many
Years ago: I say, with thee, that the boast∣ed
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Terms which those Men make wicked use
of, such as <HI>Regular</HI> and <HI>uninterrupted Succes∣sions,
Authoritative Benedictions, Excommu∣nications,
Absolutions,</HI> &amp;c. are <HI>Vain Words,</HI>
mere <HI>Terrors of Men,</HI> not the Terrors of the
Lord, <HI>Niceties</HI> and <HI>Trifles:</HI> And therefore it
is that we disown the whole Tenor and Sub∣stance
of the Canons and Institutions of that
which they Prophanely, as I doubt not thou
wilt in time be led by these Lights to do al∣so;
I Despise and Contemn all the pretend∣ed
Authority of that which they weakly and
impertinently call, a Power derived from
<HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles:</HI> I know no Ministers
but such as is before described; as for <HI>such as
are brought up at Schools and Colleges, and so
made Ministers by the will of Man, who have
not freely received perfect Gifts from God for
perfecting of the Saints, but denies</HI> Perfection,
<HI>and so denies the Ministers Work, neither do
minister freely, but seek for Gain from their
Quarters, and will not Preach without a price;
who are not sanctified by the Word of God, but
plead for a continuance in Sin while People
walk upon the Earth: Such as Minister from
the Letter, and not from the Spirit; who can∣not
Preach except they have time to Study, and
so by their industry provide themselves, and are
not provided of the Lord (such a Ministry is
of Works, and not the Free Gift from God)
such cannot profit People, but lead them captive</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>in an empty and dead Form,</HI> always hearing,
but never able to come to the true Know∣ledge
of God: <HI>Such called Ministers we do
deny, and turn from them, and testifie against
them, as the holy men of God formerly did.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> but thy
Words tend to bring thee to the same Just
Contempt, that I have entertained, and that
Friends most righteously do entertain of these
<HI>uncalled</HI> Priests, and that in the mean time
thou wilt, by thy <HI>sober</HI> and weighty Speeches,
bring all that wicked Hierarchy, which those
Priests so violently contend for, into Con∣tempt
among the People.</P>
<P>I am therefore moved to bear my Testi∣mony
with thee against them; forasmuch as
they usurping high Dignity and Authority,
have erected a Kingdom which they say is
the Kingdom of Jesus; howbeit, as I veri∣ly
think, it is a Kingdom of this World,
forasmuch as they exercise Jurisdictions which
be of this World therein, and have taken to
themselves Powers which be of themselves;
which nevertheless they take upon them to
say, are descended to them, and by the no∣tions
and pretences of a Succession of those
Powers, they assume a Right to Exercise
those Powers over the Consciences of Men,
which Friends say they have no Right to
do: And furthermore we say and believe,
That whereas they Exercise the Power and
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Authority which alone belongs to King
<HI>Jesus,</HI> the King and sole Chief of his faithful
Followers; they therefore erect their own
Kingdom, not the Kingdom of King <HI>Jesus,</HI>
and exercise the Authority and Power, which
is his only, as their own.</P>
<P>I rejoice, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> that thou hast publish∣ed
true Doctrine, and hast given thy testi∣mony
with us to the Truth, which we on so
good and solid Foundations have receiv'd;
and I question not but thou wilt be assisted
by the Spirit of Truth to pull down and
overthrow the whole Power; Hierarchy and
Constitution of that People who call them∣selves
<HI>The Church;</HI> verily, they are Usurpers
of the Kingdom and Throne of King <HI>Jesus;</HI>
and thou shalt be a Champion of the Truth,
in that thou shalt overthrow those Ecclesi∣astick
<HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> which are
not of God, and shalt establish true Religion
in that mighty Principle of Heavenly Light,
in which it is only to be found.</P>
<P>This is that inward Revelation which
thou hast been obliged to bear thy Testimo∣ny
unto, (<HI>viz</HI>) That Light <HI>which perswades</HI>
the Minds of Men, and whereby every step
of Reformation which hath been made in
the World, hath been justified, and which,
as thou sayest well, is all the Account which
Protestants can give for their being reform'd
from the People call'd <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
And doubtless thou hast by the same Ar∣guments
justified all those, the People of
the Lord, who <HI>being perswaded</HI> in themselves
of their being guided by Heavenly Light,
have separated and withdrawn from these
Usurpations, of which thou hast spoken so
worthily.</P>
<P>And what remains, beloved Friend <HI>Ben∣jamin,</HI>
but that thou shouldst, according as
thou hast worthily begun, and according to
the Light which shineth in thy Mind, <HI>sepa∣rate
thy self from</HI> these Usurpers of unrigh∣teous
Authority, and joining thy self with
<HI>the Friends</HI> to Truth, shouldst bear thy Te∣stimony
against all Ungodliness; for verily
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou canst not but see and abhor
the Doctrine which these Men teach, saying,
We are the Church, and Power is with us;
which thou knowest is false, and is not of
God, and that the Power which they use is
not of God, but is the Power of Men, tend∣ing
to ungodly Dominion and Usurpation;
such as is that of the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> which
nevertheless they have disowned while they
yet practice.</P>
<P>For verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> it seemeth to me
that thou who hast received such Light, and
hast acknowledged the Truths which are di∣rectly
contrary to these Men, canst not any
longer continue among them, or wear those
prophane Ensigns of Idolatry, whereby thou
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
art distinguished from other Men, even in a
manner which thou thy self knowest is not
appointed by King <HI>Jesus:</HI> For verily, <HI>Ben∣jamin,</HI>
the Robes of Distinction which thou
wearest, and wherewith thou art honoured
among Men, are the Ensigns of that usurp'd
Power which thou hast so worthily condemn∣ed,
and thou canst not longer abide among
those who thou knowest are the Enemies to
the Light which thou hast receiv'd, and who
walk contrary to the Doctrine which thou
hast taught, and which we the Lord's People
have so many Years ago receiv'd.</P>
<P>Wherefore I am mov'd to advertise thee,
in behalf of the Truth, that thou shouldst
not delay any longer joining thy self unto
the Lord's People, whose Cause thou hast
already so worthily pleaded: For why
shouldst thou not cause thy Life and thy
Doctrine to conform unto each other? And
why shouldst thou decline to profess openly
thy adherence to the Lord's People, whilst
thou dost not decline to teach the Principles
which they believe, and which they have re∣ceived
from the beginning?</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> the mean and hum∣ble
Station of those who be Teachers and
Ministers of the Lord among us, may not
be agreeable to thy present Temper, who art
exalted to be great among Men; but where∣as
thou knowest that the Kingdom of <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
is not of this World, and that likewise <HI>his
Rewards are not of this World,</HI> as thou hast
most worthily taught; so <HI>Benjamin,</HI> how
shouldst thou not reject the Honours given
by Men, which are the Rewards issuing from
that usurped Power which is not according
to the Laws of <HI>his Kingdom</HI>! These sincere∣ly,
according to thy own Rules, are not of
God, neither canst thou, who art now en∣lightned
from a higher Spirit, submit to be
deck'd with their Ornaments, but shouldst
cast them off, like as Christians in Primitive
Times refused to be deck'd with the <HI>Garlands</HI>
and <HI>Vestments</HI> of Idolatrous Priests; and
like as those People who are called <HI>Prote∣stants,</HI>
refuse and detest the Habiliments and
Vestments, Titles, Dignities and Distinctions,
of the Popish Priests, choosing to be called
by the truly venerable Name of <HI>Ministers of
Christ,</HI> rather than by the Titles of <HI>Popes,
Cardinals, Abbots, Monks, Friers,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P>Forasmuch then as the Usurpers of the
Power and Authority of <HI>King Jesus</HI> have
manifestly invaded his Crown and Judicatory
also, as thou hast said, and have set up
Marks of their usurp'd Authority, <HI>to wit,</HI>
their Antichristian <HI>Excommunications, Abso∣lutions,
Exorcisms,</HI> and other profane Pra∣ctices,
and have likewise given Honours,
which our Lord and only Soveraign <HI>Jesus</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> never gave, it seemeth unto me, that
thou <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who hast so manfully de∣throned
their Power and Authority, and
hast exposed their Usurpation to such Con∣tempt,
or at least hast contemned it in thy
Heart, and with the Words of thy Mouth;
<HI>I say,</HI> it seemeth unto me that thou canst
not receive the Honours given by that usur∣ped
Authority without some Breach upon
the aforesaid Declaration of thy Principles,
and acting therein contrary to the Light
which is within thee.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> I admonish thee
to consider that thou canst not abide in the
Truth which thou hast now taught in thy
Speaking Place, and published with boldness
in Printed Papers, unless thou <HI>comest out</HI> from
among that sort of People, of whom thou
art said now to be a Ruler; <HI>forasmuch</HI> as
thou hast declared them to be Workers of
Iniquity, and Sons of <HI>Belial:</HI> Thy Consci∣ence
therefore will not suffer thee to be call∣ed
any longer by their Name; neither canst
thou be found any longer to own and join
thy self unto them: Canst thou, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
be joined unto Usurpers of the Authority of
thy Master and King? Canst thou share his
Power, whom thou hast so loudly declared
to be the <HI>sole Lawgiver</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> of his
Kingdom? Do not these Men continue their
Usurpations? Do they not continue to
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
claim that Authority which, <HI>as thou hast said,</HI>
appertains only to Christ the King? And
thou knowest, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> they will continue
to claim the same, and to exercise it, as if
it was granted unto them, albeit thou know∣est
that it is not. Wherefore, O Man, re∣move
thy self speedily from these Men;
yea, I know thou wilt remove thy self from
them: For why shouldst thou be found at
last in the company of those Men whom
thou hast filled with Contempt, <HI>saying,</HI> They
are Enemies to the Kingdom of <HI>Jesus</HI> in the
World.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> thou hast done well in
that thou hast openly declared the Iniquity
of those who have armed themselves with
unlawful Power, and have exercised Ty∣ranny
over their Brethren, <HI>saying,</HI> Ye must
join with us, otherwise ye shall go to Pri∣son;
or otherwise you shall have no Ho∣nour,
or Part or Lot among us; whereas
King <HI>Jesus</HI> never left any such Command∣ment:
But it remaineth as a Difficulty, or
Doubt, unto us who are Friends, how thou
canst, O <HI>Benjamin,</HI> lay a Confederacy with
these Men! Art not thou therein an Usur∣per
also with them of the Power and Au∣thority
of thy only Lord and King; and
that in a much grosser manner than they?
Verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> if thou come not out
from among them, thou wilt give occasion
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
to wicked Men to say of thee, that thou
hast said that in thy Teaching Office which
thou wilt not put in practice in thy own
Person; and they will speak evil words of
thee, <HI>saying,</HI> Thou teachest Men to do what
thou shunnest to do thy self; and that thou
shunnest not those things which thou teach∣est
others to shun and avoid. Moreover,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> Art thou not even at this time,
and after the similitude of thine own words,
according to thy own Doctrine, an Usurper
of the Authority of <HI>King Jesus,</HI> in that
thou continuest to exercise that same Power,
of which thou hast said that <HI>King Jesus</HI>
gave no such Power unto Men, <HI>to wit,</HI> that
profane unlawful Power which those whom
Men call Bishops generally exercise over
their Brethren, oppressing the Lord's People
in their ungodly Courts. Dost thou not
preside in thy usurped Judicature, exercising
that Power there which thou hast said, <HI>the
Lord hath not given thee a Right to exercise</HI>?
And dost thou not there make use of those
things which thou hast owned to be <HI>Trifles</HI>
and <HI>Nullities,</HI> to wit, <HI>Excommunications,
Absolutions,</HI> and such like things? I say,
Dost thou not suffer these things to be done
in thy Name, to the Subjects of thy Lord,
in those Seats of Evil Men called Ecclesi∣astick
Courts? And how canst thou do this
after thou hast so plainly told us, that this
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
is to make thy self King in the stead of thy
King Jesus. Nay, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> in this
thou hast not done well; <HI>forasmuch also,</HI> as
thou hast sinned herein against the Light
that is in thee, and hast caused thy Feet to
tread aside out of the Path of Truth, which
thou hast chalked out for others, that they
might walk therein: But I trust that thou wilt
be guided by the good Spirit, and by the
light of Truth shining in thy Soul, and then
thou wilt be sure to come away and remove
from the Tents of wickedness.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> as I know
that the Truth hath been spoken by thee,
I warn thee, for thy good, that thou come
out speedily from among them; lay down
thy painted Vestments, and prophane Trin∣kets,
the Ensigns of that Usurpation upon
thy Lord and Master's Kingdom, which thou
hast so faithfully born thy Testimony a∣gainst;
<HI>I say,</HI> I exhort thee to lay them
down speedily, and come out from among
them forthwith, <HI>joyning thy self unto us,</HI>
whose Principles thou hast acknowledged:
So shall thy Life and Doctrine be Uniform,
and thou shalt be sure to deserve that Bles∣sing
which attends those who are not asha∣med
to Practice the things which they Pro∣fess.</P>
<P>Likewise,
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> this will enable thee
to overcome the Gainsayers; for behold
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
they do already upbraid thee herewith; and
verily the Man called <HI>Andrew Snape,</HI> hath
spoken unto thee Words of scorning with
boldness, in a Book which he stileth, a Let∣ter
written unto thee; and in the Twenty
and Fifth Page thereof, that <HI>if the Case be as
thou hast said, it is the</HI> Men called Parsons,
<HI>have nothing more to do but to throw up their
Orders, since their Church hath no need of them,
and since they not only do no Service, but are
Guilty of a Criminal Ʋsurpation.</HI></P>
<P>Likewise hath the same <HI>Andrew Snape</HI> said
unto thee in his said Book, and in the Thirty
and Sixth Page thereof, these words, <HI>to wit,</HI>
That he doth not see <HI>how, upon these Princi∣ples,
thou canst take thy place in the Provincial
Sanhedrim of the Priests,</HI> or how <HI>thou canst
require Subscriptions or Declarations of those
of the Sons of the Prophets whom thou dost ad∣mit
to the Priesthood among thy People,</HI> or how
<HI>thou canst Exercise almost any Act of Episcopal
Jurisdiction.</HI></P>
<P>Now verily, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> albeit this same
<HI>Andrew Snape</HI> is a Man by his Profession in
an evil way, and such as I allow not to be
according to the Truth; yet nevertheless
herein hath he spoken unto thee words
which thou shouldest consider well of; for
that they are of weight unto thee, <HI>to wit,</HI>
That thou shouldst separate thy self from E∣vil-doers,
whose ways thou knowest to be
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
Wrong; and that whereas thou hast con∣demned
them for Usurpation, and Invasion
of the Kingdom of <HI>King Jesus,</HI> thou should∣est
not at the same time continue among
them, or sit in thy Seat in their Assemblies.</P>
<P>Moreover, it seemeth unto me, <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that whereas thou hast replied to <HI>Andrew
Snape</HI> in harsh Words, saying, That he hath
evil entreated thee, and hath written bitter
things against thee, and things which sa∣vour
not of Truth; yet nevertheless, I per∣ceive
that thou hast not said one word unto
him to Gainsay what he hath told thee con∣cerning
thy coming out from among them,
or that thou canst not, by thy own Princi∣ples,
take thy Seat in the Assembly of thy
Priests; wherefore I rejoice in thy behalf,
nothing doubting but that thou wilt come
and join thy self with the Lord's People,
who are Friends unto the Truth, and unto
all that thou hast said of the Usurpation of
Men, and as I have already given thee to
understand, have many Years received the
Truths which thou hast Preached at this
day.</P>
<P>Neither let it grieve thee, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
that thou shalt relinquish the things which
Men call Honours and Greatness, and shalt
lose thereby the Advantages and Profits
which thou dost now receive; forasmuch as
thou knowest that the Rewards of the King∣dom
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
<HI>of Jesus,</HI> are <HI>not of this World;</HI> and if
the Rewards of this World are the Sanctions
of the Kingdom whereof thou hast spoken,
then it is not of <HI>Jesus:</HI> So that thou shalt
only relinquish the Rewards of this World,
and shalt seek the Rewards of that Kingdom
which is not of this World.</P>
<P>These things being so naturally drawn
from thy own words, I trust thou wilt not
Hesitate thereat, but wilt accept of my
wholesome Advice, and shew thy self not to
be ashamed of the practising those things
whereof thou hast testify'd, <HI>saying,</HI> That they
are True.</P>
<P>Neither canst thou, Friend <HI>Benjamin,</HI> be
in danger of joyning with any other People
than those, whose Profession I have here in∣vited
thee to; since there are not any who
have received the Truths which thou hast
Preached in their full Degrees, so as the
People, who in contempt are called <HI>Quakers;</HI>
with whom, as I have shewed, thou hast per∣fectly
conformed thy self to the Honour of
thy Judgment, and of the divine Light shew∣ing
forth in thee.</P>
<P>As for those People called <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
thou canst by no means joyn thy self unto
them, seeing they have declared themselves
in Terms greatly opposite to thy Doctrines,
saying, That Men have Power to make Laws,
binding the Consciences of others; and that
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Rewards and Punishments of this World ap∣pertain
to Humane Authority, exercised by
such as they call a Succession of Officers:
These their Opinions are not according to
Truth, as Friends have received it; neither
are they like unto those. Truths which thou
hast Preached: And therefore we see that
questionless thou wilt avoid also the Errone∣ous
Opinions of Persecuting <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
and wilt joyn thy self unto us; and this I
speak unto thee with the more certainty, <HI>for∣asmuch</HI>
as, Blessed by the Lord, thou art al∣ready
come beyond the corrupt Tenets of
those People: Moreover, beloved Friend
<HI>Benjamin,</HI> I make known unto thee, that the
said <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are equally guilty of those
things which the People of the Lord abhor;
<HI>to wit,</HI> The pretences to a Power, which, as
thou saidst well, <HI>Jesus</HI> the King of all those
who are led by the light of the Truth, never
delegated to them; and this they not only
give to their Followers, but make Laws of
their own; <HI>I say,</HI> Humane Laws, and Sanc∣tions
of Laws, such as Rewards and Punish∣ments,
for enforcing others to comply there∣with;
to wit, That they admit none to be
Teachers among them, or to Preach and
Prophesy unto the People, unless they pro∣fess
to believe and to receive certain Points
which they call <HI>prophanely,</HI> Articles of Faith;
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
wherein these wicked usurpations of Power
are openly declared by them, saying,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>1. "That the Lord Jesus, as King and
Head of his Church, hath therein appoint∣ed
a Government in the hand of Church-Officers
distinct from the Civil Magi∣strate."</P>
<P>2. "That to these Officers the Keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven are committed;
by Vertue whereof they have Power re∣spectively
to Retain and Remit Sins, to shut
that Kingdom against the Impenitent, both
by the Word and Censures, and to open
it unto penitent Sinners, by the Ministry
of the Gospel, and by Absolution from
Censures, as occasion shall require."</P>
<P>3. "That these Church Censures are ne∣cessary,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for preventing the Wrath of
God, which might fall upon the Church,
if they should suffer the Seal of the Cove∣nant
to be prophaned by Notorious and
Obstinate Offenders."</P></Q></P>
<P>These things thou knowest, <HI>Benjamin,</HI> are
contrary to the Doctrines and Positions
which thou hast so openly avowed, being no
less than Invasions, and manifest Usurpati∣ons,
of the Kingdom and Authority of King
Jesus, and in themselves <HI>Nullities</HI> and <HI>Trifles.</HI></P>
<P>Yet these things, and in these Words,
thou wilt find in those <HI>Heads of Belief,</HI> which
these ungodly <HI>Presbyterians</HI> call the Confessi∣on
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
of their Faith, <HI>Article</HI> the XXX. How∣beit,
Blessed art thou, O <HI>Benjamin,</HI> in that
thou hast born thy Testimony against these
also. Wherefore I know, that leaving be∣hind
thee all these wicked and erroneous O∣pinions,
and bearing witness to the Truth,
thou wilt at length joyn thy self unto us;
and I rejoice over thee in this, that thou art
inlightned to know the Truth; Testifying
that I embrace thee with Affection in the
Lord.</P>
<P>Friend <HI>Timothy</HI> Greeteth thee in like man∣ner;
as also <HI>James</HI> the Aged, a Lover of
those who forsake the Errors of the Wicked:
In a word, all Friends Greet, and speak well
of thee.</P>
<TRAILER>Fare thee well.</TRAILER>
