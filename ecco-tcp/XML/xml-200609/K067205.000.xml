<P>THE general design of the following sheets is to
inlist Imagination under the banner of Science; and to
lead her votaries from the looser analogies, which dress out
the imagery of poetry, to the stricter, ones which form the
ratiocination of philosophy. While their particular design
is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the knowledge of
Botany, by introducing them to the vestibule of that de∣lightful
science, and recommending to their attention the
immortal works of the celebrated Swedish Naturalist,
LINNEUS.</P>
<P>In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the phy∣siology
of Plants is delivered; and the operation of the
Elements, as far as they may be supposed to affect the
growth of Vegetables. In the second Poem, or Loves of
the Plants, the Sexual System of Linneus is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper here to apologize for many of the
subsequent conjectures on some articles of natural philosophy, as
not being supported by accurate investigation or conclusive experi∣ments.
Extravagant theories however in those parts of philosophy,
where our knowledge is yet imperfect, are not without their use;
as they encourage the execution of laborious experiments, or the
investigation of ingenious deductions, to confirm or refute them.
And since natural objects are allied to each other by many affinities,
every kind of theoretic distribution of them adds to our knowledge
by developing some of their analogies.</P>
<P>The Rosicrucian doctrine of Gnomes, Sylphs, Nymphs, and
Salamanders, was thought to afford a proper machinery for a
Botanic poem; as it is probable, that they were originally the
names of hieroglyphic figures representing the elements.</P>
<P>Many of the important operations of Nature were shadowed or
allegorized in the heathen mythology, as the first Cupid springing
from the Egg of Night, the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, the Rape
of Proserpine, the Congress of Jupiter and Juno, Death and Resus∣citation
of Adonis, &amp;c. many of which are ingeniously explained in
the works of Bacon, Vol. V. p. 47. 4th Edit. London, 1778. The
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
Egyptians were possessed of many discoveries in philosophy and che∣mistry
before the invention of letters; these were then expressed in
hieroglyphic paintings of men and animals; which after the dis∣covery
of the alphabet were described and animated by the poets,
and became first the deities of Egypt, and afterwards of Greece and
Rome. Allusions to those fables were therefore thought proper orna∣ments
to a philosophical poem, and are occasionally introduced
either as represented by the poets, or preserved on the numerous
gems and medallions of antiquity.</P>

<L>I. "NYMPHS OF PRIMEVAL FIRE! YOUR vestal train<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Nymphs of primeval fire.</HI> l. 97. The fluid matter of heat is perhaps the most exten∣sive element in nature; all other bodies are immersed in it, and are preserved in their present state of solidity or fluidity by the attraction of their particles to the matter of heat. Since all known bodies are contractible into less space by depriving them of some portion of their heat, and as there is no part of nature totally deprived of heat, there is reason to believe that the particles of bodies do not touch, but are held towards each other by their self-attraction, and recede from each other by their attraction to the mass of heat which surrounds them; and thus exist in an equilibrium between these two powers. If more of the matter of heat be applied to them, they recede further from each other, and become fluid; if still more be applied, they take an aerial form, and are termed Gasses by the modern chemists. Thus when water is heated to a certain degree, it would instantly assume the form of steam, but for the pressure of the atmo∣sphere, which prevents this change from taking place so easily; the same is true of quicksilver, diamonds, and of perhaps all other bodies in Nature; they would first become fluid, and then aeriform by appropriated degrees of heat. On the contrary, this elastic matter of heat, termed Calorique in the new nomenclature of the French Academicians, is liable to become consolidated itself in its combinations with some bodies, as perhaps in nitre, and probably in combustible bodies as sulphur and char∣coal. See note on l. 232, of this Canto. Modern philosophers have not yet been able to decide whether light and heat be different fluids, or modifications of the same fluid, as they have many properties in common. See note on l. 468 of this Canto.</NOTE></L>

From having observed the gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from its egg or seed; and afterwards its successive advances to its more perfect state, or maturity; philosophers of all ages seem to have imagined, that the great world itself had likewise its infancy and its gradual progress to maturity; this seems to have given origin to the very antient and sublime allegory of Eros, or Divine Love, producing the world from the egg of Night, as it floated in Chaos. See l. 419. of this Canto.</P>
<P>The external crust of the earth, as far as it has been exposed to our view in mines or mountains, countenances this opinion; since these have evidently for the most part had their origin from the shells of fishes, the decomposition of vegetables, and the recrements of other animal materials, and must therefore have been formed progressively from small beginnings. There are likewise some apparently useless or incomplete appendages to plants and animals, which seem to shew they have gradually undergone changes from their original state; such as the stamens without anthers, and styles without stigmas of several plants, as mentioned in the note on Curcuma, Vol. II. of this work. Such as the halteres, or rudiments of wings of some two-winged insects; and the paps of male animals; thus swine have four toes, but two of them are imperfectly formed, and not long enough for use. The allantoide in some animals seems to have become extinct; in others is above tenfold the size, which would seem necessary for its purpose. Buffon du Cochon. T. 6. p. 257. Perhaps all the supposed monstrous births of Nature are re∣mains of their habits of production in their former less perfect state, or attempts towards greater perfection.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Astonish'd Chaos heard the potent word;—</L>
<L>Through all his realms the kindling Ether runs,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Through all his realms.</HI> l, 105. Mr. Herschel has given a very sublime and curious account of the construction of the heavens with his discovery of some thousand nebulae, or clouds of stars; many of which are much larger collections of stars, than all those put together, which are visible to our naked eyes, added to those which form the galaxy, or milky zone, which surrounds us. He observes that in the vicinity of these clusters of stars there are proportionally fewer stars than in other parts of the heavens; and hence he concludes, that they have attracted each other, on the supposition that infinite space was at first equally sprinkled with them; as if it had at the beginning been filled with a fluid mass, which had coagulated. Mr. Herschel has further shewn, that the whole sidereal system is gradually moving round some centre, which may be an opake mass of matter, Philos. Trans. V. LXXIV. If all these Suns are moving round some great central body; they must have had a projectile force, as well as a centripetal one; and may thence be supposed to have emerged or been projected from the material, where they were produced. We can have no idea of a natural power, which could project a Sun out of Chaos, ex∣cept by comparing it to the explosions or earthquakes owing to the sudden evolution of aqueous or of other more elastic vapours; of the power of which under immeasurable degrees of heat, and compression, we are yet ignorant.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that if the stars had been projected from a Chaos by explosions, that they must have returned again into it from the known laws of gravitation; this how∣ever would not happen, if the whole of Chaos, like grains of gunpowder, was exploded at the same time, and dispersed through infinite space at once, or in quick succession, in every possible direction. The same objection may be stated against the possibility of the planets having been thrown from the fun by explosions; and the secondary planets from the primary ones; which will be spoken of more at large in the second Canto, but if the planets are supposed to have been projected from their suns, and the secondary from the primary ones, at the beginning of their course; they might be so influenced or diverted by the attractions of the suns, or sun, in their vicinity, as to prevent their tendency to return into the body, from which they were projected.</P>
<P>Is these innumerable and immense suns thus rising out of Chaos are supposed to have thrown out their attendant planets by new explosions, as they ascended; and those their respective satellites, filling in a moment the immensity of space with light and motion, a grander idea cannot be conceived by the mind of man.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="105"/></L>

Mr. Cavendish has shewn, that the gas called inflam∣mable air, is at least ten times lighter than common air; Mr. Lavoisier contends, that it is one of the component parts of water, and is by him called hydrogene. It is supposed to afford their principal nourishment to vegetables and thence to animals, and is perpetually rising from their decomposition; this source of it in hot climates, and in summer months, is so great as to exceed estimation. Now if this light gas passes through the atmosphere, without combining with it, it must compose another atmosphere over the aerial one; which must expand, when the pressure above it is thus taken away, to inconceivable tenuity.</P>
<P>If this supernatural gasseous atmosphere floats upon the aerial one, like ether upon water, what must happen? l. it will flow from the line, where it will be produced in the greatest quantities, and become much accumulated over the poles of the earth; 2. the common air, or lower stratum of the atmosphere, will be much thinner over the poles than at the line; because if a glass globe be filled with oil and water, and whirled upon its axis, the centrifugal power will carry the heavier fluid to the circumference, and the lighter will in consequence be found round the axis. 3. There may be a place at some certain latitude between the poles and the line on each side the equator, where the inflammable supernatant atmosphere may end, owing to the greater centrifugal force of the heavier aerial atmosphere. 4. Between the termination of the aerial and the beginning of the gasseous atmosphere, the airs will occasionally be intermixed, and thus become inflam∣mable by the electric spark; these circumstances will assist in explaining the phenomena of fire-balls, northern lights, and of some variable winds, and long continued rains.</P>
<P>Since the above note was first written, Mr. Volta I am informed has applied the sup∣position of a supernatant atmosphere of inflammable air, to explain some phenomena in meteorology. And Mr. Lavoisier has announced his design to write on this subject. Traitè de Chimie, Tom. I. I am happy to find these opinions supported by such respect∣able authority.</P></NOTE></L>

The crepuscular atmosphere, or the region where the light of the sun ceases to be refracted to us, is estimated by philosophers to be between 40 and 50 miles high, at which time the sun is about 18 degrees below the horizon; and the rarity of the air is supposed to be from 4,000 to 10,000 times greater than at the sur∣face of the earth. Cotes's Hydrost. p. 123. The duration of twilight differs in different seasons and in different latitudes; in England the shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March; in more northern latitudes, where the sun never finks more than 18 degrees, below the horizon, the twilight continues the whole night. The time of its duration may also be occasionally affected by the varying height of the atmo∣sphere. A number of observations on the duration of twilight in different latitudes might afford considerable information concerning the aerial strata in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and might assist in determining whether an exterior atmosphere of inflam∣mable gas, or Hydrogene, exists over the aerial one.</P></NOTE></L>

The immediate cause of volcanic eruptions is believed to be owing to the water of the sea, or from lakes, or inundations, finding itself a passage into the subterraneous fires, which may lie at great depths. This must first produce by its coldness a condensation of the vapour there existing, or a vacuum, and thus occasion parts of the earth's crust or shell to be forced down by the pressure of the incumbent at∣mosphere. Afterwards the water being suddenly raised into steam produces all the explosive effects of earthquakes. And by new accessions of water during the intervals of the ex∣plosions the repetition of the shocks is caused. These circumstances were hourly illustrated by the fountains of boiling water in Iceland, in which the surface of the water in the boiling wells sunk down low before every new ebullition.</P>
<P>Besides these eruptions occasioned by the steam of water, there seems to be a perpetual effusion of other vapours, more noxious and (as far as it is yet known) perhaps greatly more expansile than water from the Volcanos in various parts of the world. As these Volcanos are supposed to be spiracula or breathing holes to the great subterraneous fires, it is probable that the escape of elastic vapours from them is the cause, that the earth∣quakes of modern days are of such small extent compared to those of antient times, of which vestiges remain in every part of the world, and on this account may be said not only to be innocuous, but useful.</P></NOTE></L>

The air, like all other bad conductors of electricity, is known to be a bad conductor of heat; and thence prevents the heat acquired from the sun's rays by the earth's surface from being so soon dissipated, in the same manner as a blanket, which may be considered as a sponge filled with air, prevents the escape of heat from the person wrapped in it. This seems to be one cause of the great degree of cold on the tops of mountains, where the rarity of the air is greater, and it therefore be∣comes a better conductor both of heat and electricity. See note on Barometz, Vol. II. of this work.</P>
<P>There is however another cause to which the great coldness of mountains and of the higher regions of the atmosphere is more immediately to be ascribed, explained by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. who has there proved by experiments with the air-gun and air-pump, that when any portion of the atmosphere becomes mechanically expanded, it absorbs heat from the bodies in its vicinity. And as the air which creeps along the plains, expands itself by a part of the pressure being taken off when it ascends the sides of mountains; it at the same time attracts heat from the summits of those mountains, or other bodies which happen to be immersed in it, and thus produces cold. Hence he concludes that the hot air at the bottom of the Andes becomes temperate by its own rarefaction when it ascents to the city of Quito; and by its further rarefaction becomes cooled to the freezing point when it ascends to the snowy regions on the sum∣mits of those mountains. To this also he attributes the great degree of cold experienced by the aeronauts in their balloons; and which produces hail in summer at the height of only two or three miles in the atmosphere.</P></NOTE></L>

I have often been induced to believe from observation, that the twilight of the evenings is lighter than that of the mornings at the same distance from noon. Some may ascribe this to the greater height of the atmosphere in the even∣ings having been rarefied by the sun during the day; but as its density must at the same time be diminished, its power of refraction would continue the same. I should rather suppose that it may be owing to the phosphorescent quality (as it is called) of almost all bodies; that is, when they have been exposed to the sun they continue to emit light for a considerable time afterwards. This is generally believed to arise either from such bodies giving out the light which they had previously absorbed; or to the continuance of a slow combustion which the light they had been previously exposed to had excited.

Beccari made made many curious experiments on the phos∣phoric light, as it is called, which becomes visible on bodies brought into a dark room, after having been previously exposed to the sunshine. It appears from these experiments, that almost all inflammable bodies possess this quality in a greater or less degree; white paper or linen thus examined after having been exposed to the sunshine, is luminous to an extraordinary degree; and if a person shut up in a dark room, puts one of his hands out into the sun's light for a short time and then retracts it, he will be able to see that hand distinctly, and not the other. These experiments seem to countenance the idea of light being absorbed and again emitted from bodies when they are removed into darkness. But Beccari further pretended, that some calcareous compositions when exposed to red, yellow, or blue light, through coloured glasses, would on their being brought into a dark room emit coloured lights. This mistaken fact of Beccari's, Mr. Wilson decidedly refutes; and among many other curious experiments discovered, that if oyster-shells were thrown into a common fire and calcined for about half an hour, and then brought to a person who had previously been some minutes in a dark room, that many of them would exhibit beautiful irises of prismatic colours, from whence probably arose Beccari's mistake. Mr. Wilson from hence contends, that these kinds of phosphori do not emit the light they had previously received, but that they are set on fire by the sun's rays, and continue for some time a slow combustion after they are withdrawn from the light. Wilson's Expe∣riments on Phosphori. Dodsley, 1775.</P>
<P>The Bolognian stone is a selenite, or gypsum, and has been long celebrated for its phosphorescent quality after having been burnt in a sulphurous fire; and exposed when cold to the sun's light. It may be thus well imitated: Calcine oyster-shells half an hour, pulverize them when cold, and add one third part of flowers of sulphur, press them close into a small crucible, and calcine them for an hour or longer, and keep the powder in a phial close stopped. A part of this powder is to be exposed for a minute or two to the sunbeams, and then brought into a dark room. The calcined Bolognian stone be∣comes a calcareous hepar of sulphur; but the calcined shells, as they contain the animal acid, may also contain some of the phosphorus of Kunkel.</P></NOTE></L>

Surinam in South America; those which were brought over to England about eight years
ago were about three or four feet long, and gave an electric shock (as I experienced) by
putting one finger on the back near its head, and another of the opposite hand into the
water near its tail. In their native country they are said to exceed twenty feet in length,
and kill any man who approaches them in an hostile manner. It is not only to escape its
enemies that this surprizing power of the fish is used, but also to take its prey; which
it does by benumbing them and then devouring them before they have time to recover,
or by perfectly killing them; for the quantity of the power seemed to be determined by
the will or anger of the animal; as it sometimes struck a fish twice before it was suf∣ficiently
benumbed to be easily swallowed.</P>
<P>The organs productive of this wonderful accumulation of electric matter have been
accurately dissected and described by Mr. J. Hunter. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXV. And
are so divided by membranes as to compose a very extensive surface, and are supplied
with many pairs of nerves larger than any other nerves of the body; but how so large a
quantity is so quickly accumulated as to produce such amazing effects in a fluid ill adapted
for the purpose is not yet satisfactorily explained. The Torpedo possesses a similar power
in a less degree, as was shewn by Mr. Walch, and another fish lately described by Mr.
Paterson. Philo. Trans. Vol. LXXVI.</P>
<P>In the construction of the Leyden-Phial, (as it is called) which is coated on both
sides, it is known, that above one hundred times the quantity of positive electricity can
be condensed on every square inch of the coating on one side, than could have been ac∣cumulated
on the same surface if there had been no opposite coating communicating
with the earth; because the negative electricity, or that part of it which caused its ex∣pansion,
is now drawn off through the glass. It is also well known, that the thinner
the glass is (which is thus coated on both sides so as to make a Leyden-phial, or plate)
the more electricity can be condensed on one of its surfaces, till it becomes so thin as to
break, and thence discharge itself.</P>
<P>Now it is possible, that the quantity of electricity condensible on one side of a coated
phial may increase in some high ratio in respect to the thinness of the glass, since the
power of attraction is known to decrease as the squares of the distances, to which this cir∣cumstance
of electricity seems to bear some analogy. Hence if an animal membrane, as
thin as the silk-worm spins its silk, could be so situated as to be charged like the Leyden
bottle, without bursting, (as such thin glass would be liable to do,) it would be difficult
to calculate the immense quantity of electric fluid, which might be accumulated on its
surface. No land animals are yet discovered which possess this power, though the air
would have been a much better medium for producing its effects; perhaps the size of the
necessary apparatus would have been inconvenient to land animals.</P></NOTE></L>

For many ages it is probable fire was esteemed a dangerous enemy, known only by its dreadful devastations; and that many lives must have been lost, and many dangerous burns and wounds must have afflicted those who first dared to subject it to the uses of life. It is said that the tall monkies of Borneo and Sumatra lie down with pleasure ruond any accidental fire in their woods; and are arrived to that degree of reason, that knowledge of causation, that they thrust into the remaining fire the half-burnt ends of the branches to prevent its going out. One of the nobles of the cultivated people of Otaheita, when Captain Cook treated them with tea, catched the boiling water in his hand from the cock of the tea-urn, and bellowed with pain, not conceiving that water could become hot, like red fire.</P>
<P>Tools of steel constitute another important discovery in consequence of fire; and contributed perhaps principally to give the European nations so great superiority over the American world. By these two agents, fire and tools of steel, mankind became able to cope with the vegetable kingdom, and conquer provinces of forests, which in uncul∣tivated countries almost exclude the growth of other vegetables, and of those animals which are necessary to our existence. Add to this, that the quantity of our food is also increased by the use of fire, for some vegetables become salutary food by means of the heat used in cookery, which are naturally either noxious or difficult of digestion; as potatoes, kidney-beans, onions, cabbages. The cassava when made into bread, is perhaps rendered mild by the heat it undergoes, more than by expressing its superfluous juice. The roots of white bryony and of arum, I am informed lose much of their acrimony by boiling.</P></NOTE></L>

The phenomena of chemical explosions cannot be accounted for without the supposition, that some of the bodies employed contain concentrated or solid heat combined with them, to which the French Chemists have given the name of Calorique. When air is expanded in the air-pump, or water evaporated into steam, they drink up or absorb a great quantity of heat; from this analogy, when gunpowder is ex∣ploded it ought to absorb much heat, that is, in popular language, it ought to produce a great quantity of cold. When vital air is united with phlogistic matter in respiration, which seems to be a slow combustion, its volume is lessened; the carbonic acid, and per∣haps phosphoric acid are produced; and heat is given out; which according to the ex∣periments of Dr. Crawford would seem to be deposited from the vital air. But as the vital air in nitrous acid is condensed from a light elastic gas to that of a heavy fluid, it must possess less heat than before. And hence a great part of the heat, which is given out in firing gunpowder, I should suppose, must reside in the sulphur or charcoal.</P>
<P>Mr. Lavoisier has shewn, that vital air, or Oxygene, looses less of its heat when it becomes one of the component parts of nitrous acid, than in any other of its combinations; and is hence capable of giving out a great quantity of heat in the explosion of gunpowder; but as there seems to be great analogy between the matter of heat, or Calorique, and the electric matter; and as the worst conductors of electricity are believed to contain the greatest quantity of that fluid; there is reason to suspect that the worst conductors of heat may contain the most of that fluid; as sulphur, wax, silk, air, glass.

They are kindled by the heat produced by the collision; but their vivid light, and their fusion and vitrification are the effects of a combustion continued in these particles during their passage through the air. This opinion is confirmed by an experiment of Mr. Hawksbee, who found that these sparks could not be produced in the exhausted receiver. See Keir's Chemical Dict. art. Iron, and art.

The words are, sed tamen salis petrae <HI>lure mope can ubre,</HI> et sulphuris; et sic facies tonitrum, et corrusca∣tionem, si scias, artificium. The words lure mope can ubre are an anagram of carbonum pulvere. Biograph. Britan. Vol. I. Bacon de Secretis Operibus, Cap. XI. He adds, that he thinks by an artifice of this kind Gideon defeated the Midianites with only three hundred men. Judges, Chap. VII. Chamb. Dict. art. Gunpowder. As Bacon does not claim this as his own invention, it is thought by many to have been of much more antient discovery.</P>
<P>The permanently elastic fluid generated in the firing of gunpowder is calculated by Mr. Robins to be about 244 if the bulk of the powder be I. And that the heat gene∣rated at the time of the explosion occasions the rarefied air thus produced to occupy about 1000 times the space of the gunpowder. This pressure may therefore be called equal to 1000 atmospheres or six tons upon a square inch. As the suddenness of this explosion must contribute much to its power, it would seem that the chamber of powder, to produce its greatest effect, should be lighted in the centre of it; which I believe is not attended to in the manufacture of muskets or pistols.</P>
<P>From the cheapness with which a very powerful gunpowder is likely soon to be manufactured from aerated marine acid, or from a new method of forming nitrous acid by means of mangonese or other calciform ores, it may probably in time be applied to move machinery, and supersede the use of steam.</P>
<P>There is a bitter invective in Don Quixot against the inventors of gun-powder, as it levels the strong with the weak, the knight cased in steel with the naked shepherd, those who have been trained to the sword, with those who are totally unskilful in the use of it; and throws down all the splendid distinctions of mankind.

The invention of the steam-engine for raising water by the pressure of the air in consequence of the condensation of steam, is properly ascribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and description of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art. Engine. Though the Marquis of Worcester in his Century of Inventions printed in the year 1663 had described an engine for raising water by the explosive power of steam long before Savery's. Mr. Desegulier affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worcester, and destroyed them, professing himself then to have discovered the power of steam by accident, which seems to have been an unfounded slander. Savery applied it to the raising of water to supply houses and gardens, but could not accomplish the draining of mines by it. Which was after∣wards done by Mr. Newcomen and Mr. John Cowley at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the piston.</P>
<P>A few years ago Mr. Watt of Glasgow much improved this machine, and with Mr. Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purposes, such as raising water from mines, blowing bellows to fuse the ore, supplying towns with water, grinding corn and many other purposes. There is reason to believe it may in time be applied to the row∣ing of barges, and the moving of carriages along the road. As the specific levity of air is too great for the support of great burthens by balloons, there seems no probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of steam, or some other explosive material; which another half century may probable discover.

The benevolence of the great Author of all things is greatly manifest in the sum of his works, as Dr. Balguy has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted, printed for Davis, 1781. Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each other, there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others. Thus the nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources: 1. the milk given from the mother to the offspring; in this excellent contrivance the mother has pleasure in affording the suste∣nance to the child, and the child has pleasure in receiving it. 2. Another source of the food of animals includes seeds or eggs; in these the embryon is in a torpid or insensible state, and there is along with it laid up for its early nourishment a store of provision, as the fruit belonging to some seeds, and the oil and starch belonging to others; when these are consumed by animals the unfeeling seed or egg receives no pain, but the animal receives pleasure which consumes it. Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the last method of supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals, as lions preying upon lambs, these upon living vege∣tables, and mankind upon them all, would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of nature than those before mentioned, as contributing less to the sum of general happi∣ness.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>"So mighty HERCULES o'er many a clime<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>So mighty Hercules.</HI> l. 297. The story of Hercules seems of great antiquity, as appears from the simplicity of his dress and armour, a lion's skin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the destruction of wild beasts and robbers. This part of the history of Hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow, or of spinning flax. Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river-god Achilous, and bringing Cerberus up to day light; the former might refer to his turning the course of a river, and draining a morass, and the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times. The strangling the lion and tearing his jaws asunder, are described from a statue in the Museum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the grasping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth, is described from another antient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules have been variously explained. Pliny asserts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calpè on each side of the straits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules; and that they were reared by the hands of that god, and the sea admitted between them. Plin. Hist. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.</P>
<P>If the passage between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in antient times, as this allegorical story would seem to countenance, there must have been an im∣mense current of water at first run into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic; since there is at present a strong stream sets always from thence into the Mediterranean. Whatever may be the cause, which now constantly operates, so as to make the surface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic, it must have kept it very much lower before a passage for the water through the streights was opened. It is probable before such an event took place, the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that sea, and were then for a great extent of country, destroyed by the floods occasioned by the new rise of water, and have since remained beneath the sea. Might not this give rise to the flood of Deucalion? See note Cassia, V. II. of this work.</P></NOTE></L>

The theory of the accumulation of the electric fluid by means of the glass-globe and cushion is difficult to comprehend. Dr. Franklin's idea of the pores of the glass being opened by the friction, and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric fluid, which it again parts with, as the pores contract again, feems analogous in some measure to the heat produced by the vibration, or condensation of bodies, as when a nail is hammered or filed till it becomes hot, as mentioned in ad∣ditional Notes, No. VII. Some philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phe∣nomenon by supposing the existence of two electric fluids which may be called the vitreous and resinous ones, instead of the plus and minus of the same ether, But its accumulation on the rubbed glass bears great analogy to its accumulation on the surface of the Leyden bottle, and can not perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle.

It is now become a part of the symbolic language of painting, and it is much to be wished that this kind of hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art; as it is much wanted to render historic pictures both more intelligible, and more sublime; and why should not painting as well as poetry express itself in metaphor, or in indistinct alle∣gory? A truly great modern painter lately endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of pictorial language, by putting a demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed. Which unfortunately for the scientific part of painting, the cold criticism of the present day has depreciated; and thus barred perhaps the only road to the further improvement in this science.</P></NOTE></L>

There is probably a system of nerves in animal bodies for the purpose of perceiving heat; since the degree of this fluid is so necessary to health that we become presently injured either by its access or defect; and because almost every part of our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves, which would not seem necessary for their motion alone. It is therefore probable, that our sen∣sation of electricity is only of its violence in passing through our system by its suddenly distending the muscles, like any other mechanical violence; and that it is general pain alone that we feel, and not any sensation analogous to the specific quality of the object. Nature may seem to have been niggardly to mankind in bestowing upon them so few senses; since a sense to have perceived electricity, and another to have perceived mag∣netism might have been of great service to them, many ages before these fluids were dis∣covered by accidental experiment, but it is possible an increased number of senses might have incommoded us by adding to the size of our bodies.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="365"/></L>

The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is likewise caused by passing the electric shock through it; which would seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid, and the nervous fluid, which is seperated from the blood by the brain, and and thence diffused along the nerves for the purposes of motion and sensation. It probably destroys life by its sudden expansion of the nerves or fibres of the brain; in the same manner as it fuses metals and splinters wood or stone, and removes the atmosphere, when it passes from one object to another in a dense state.</P></NOTE></L>

Dr. Franklin was the first that discovered that lighten∣ing consisted of electric matter, he elevated a tall rod with a wire wrapped round it, and fixing the bottom of a rod into a glass bottle, and preserving it from falling by means of silk-strings, he found it electrified whenever a cloud passed over it, receiving sparks by his finger from it, and charging coated phials. This great discovery taught us to defend houses and ships and temples from lightning, and also to understand, <HI>that people are always perfectly safe in a room during a thunder storm if they keep themselves at three or four feet distance from the walls;</HI> for the matter of lightning in passing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds, runs through the walls of a house, the trunk of a tree, or other elevated object; except there be some moister body, as an animal in con∣tact with them, or nearly so; and in that case the lightning leaves the wall or tree, and passes through the animal; but as it can pass through metals with still greater facility, it will leave animal bodies to pass through metallic ones.</P>
<P>If a person in the open air be surprized by a thunderstorm, he will know his danger by observing on a second watch the time which passes between the flash and the crack, and reckoning a mile for every four seconds and a half, and a little more. For sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet in a second of time, and the velocity of light through such small distances is not to be estimated. In these circumstances a person will be safer by lying down on the ground, than erect, and still safer if within a few feet of his horse; which being then a more elevated animal will receive the shock in preference as the cloud passes over.

<L>YOUR VIRGIN TRAINS the transient HEAT dispart,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Transient heat dispart.</HI> l. 401. Dr. Crawford in his ingenious work on animal heat has endeavoured to prove, that during the combination of the pure part of the atmosphere with the phlogistic part of the blood, that much of the matter of the heat is given out from the air; and that this is the great and perpetual source of the heat of animals; to which we may add that the phosphoric acid is probably produced by this combination; by which acid the colour of the blood is changed in the lungs from a deep crimson to a bright scarlet. There seems to be however another source of animal heat, though of a similar nature; and that is from the chemical combinations produced in all the glands; since by whatever cause any glandular secretion is increased, as by friction or topical imflam∣mation, the heat of that part becomes increased at the same time; thus after the hands have been for a time immersed in snow, on coming into a warm room, they become red and hot, without any increased pulmonary action. BESIDES THIS there would seem to be another material received from the air by respiration; which is so necessary to life, that the embryon must learn to breath almost within a minute after its birth, or it dies. The perpetual necessity of breathing shews, that the material thus acquired is per∣petually consuming or escaping, and on that account requires perpetual renovation. Per∣haps the spirit of animation itself is thus acquired from the atmosphere, which if it be supposed to be finer or more subtle than the electric matter, could not long be retained in our bodies, and must therefore require perpetual renovation.</P></NOTE></L>

The principal frosts of this country are accompanied or produced by a N.E. wind, and the thaws by a S. W. wind; the reason of which is that the N.E. winds consist of regions of air brought from the north, which appear to acquire an easterly direction as they advance; and the S. W. winds consist of regions of air brought from the south, which appear to acquire a westerly direction as they advance. The surface of the earth nearer the pole moves slower than it does in our latitude; whence the regions of air brought from thence, move slower, when they arrive hither, than the earth's surface with which they now become in contact; that is they acquire an apparent easterly direction, as the earth moves from west to east faster than this new part of its atmosphere. The S. W. winds on the contrary consist of regions of air brought from the south, where the surface of the earth moves faster than in our latitude; and have therefore a westerly direction when they arrive hither by their moving faster than the surface of the earth, with which they are in contact; and in general the nearer to the west and the greater the velocity of these winds the warmer they should be in respect to the season of the year, since they have been brought more expeditiously from the South, than those winds which have less westerly direction, and have thence been less cooled in their passage.</P>
<P>Sometimes I have observed the thaw to commence immediately on the change of the wind, even within an hour, is I am not mistaken, or sooner. At other times the S.W. wind has continued a day, or even two, before the thaw has commenced; during which time some of the frosty air, which had gone southwards, is driven back over us; and in confequence has taken a westerly direction, as well as a southern one. At other times I have observed a frost with a N.E. wind every morning, and a thaw with a S.W. wind every noon for several days together.

The principal injury done to vegetation by frost is from the expansion of the water contained in the vessels of plants. Water converted into ice occupies a greater space than it did before, as appears by the bursting of bottles filled with water at the time of their freezing. Hence frost destroys those plants of our island first, which are most succulent; and the most succulent parts first of other plants; as their leaves and last year's shoots; the vessels of which are distended and burst by the ex∣pansion of their freezing fluids, while the drier or more resinous plants, as pines, yews, laurels, and other ever-greens, are less liable to injury from cold. The trees in vallies are on this account more injured by the vernal frosts than those on eminencies, because their early succulent shoots come out sooner. Hence fruit trees covered by a six-inch coping of a wall are less injured by the vernal frosts because their being shielded from showers and the descending night-dews has prevented them from being moist at the time of their being frozen: which circumstance has given occasion to a vulgar error amongst gardeners, who suppose frost to descend.</P>
<P>As the common heat of the earth in this climate is 48 degrees, those tender trees which will bear bending down, are easily secured from the frost by spreading them upon the ground, and covering them with straw or fern. This particularly suits fig-trees, as they easily bear bending to the ground, and are furnished with an acrid juice, which se∣cures them from the depredations of insects; but are nevertheless liable to be eaten by mice.

The buds and bulbs of plants constitute what is termed by Linneus the Hybernaculum, or winter cradle of the embryon vegetable. The buds arise from the bark on the branches of trees, and the bulbs from the caudex of bulbous-rooted plants, or the part from which the fibres of the root are produced, they are de∣fended from too much moisture, and from frosts, and from the depredations of insects by various contrivances, as by scales, hairs, resinous varnishes, and by acrid rinds.</P>
<P>The buds of trees are of two kinds, either flower-buds or leaf buds; the former of these produce their seeds and die; the latter produce other leaf buds or flower buds and die. So that all the buds of trees may be considered as annual plants, having their em∣bryon produced during the preceeding summer. The same seems to happen with respect to bulbs; thus a tulip produces annually one flower-bearing bulb, sometimes two, and several leaf-bearing bulbs; and then the old root perishes. Next year the flower-bearing bulb produces seeds and other bulbs and perishes; while the leaf-bearing bulb, producing other bulbs only, perishes likewise; these circumstances establish a strict analogy between bulbs and buds.

The fluid matter of heat, or Calorique, in which all bodies are immersed, is as necessary to vegetable as to animal existence. It is not yet determin∣able whether heat and light be different materials, or modifications of the same materials, as they have some properties in common. They appear to be both of them equally ne∣cessary to vegetable health, since without light green vegetables become first yellow, that is, they lose the blue colour, which contributed to produce the green; and afterwards they also lose the yellow and become white; as is seen in cellery blanched or etiolated for the table by excluding the light from it.</P>
<P>The upper surface of leaves, which I suppose to be their organ of respiration, seems to require light as well as air; since plants which grow in windows on the inside of houses are equally sollicitous to turn the upper side of their leaves to the light. Vegetables at the same time exsude or perspire a great quantity from their leaves, as animals do from their lungs; this perspirable matter as it rises from their fine vessels, (perhaps much finer than the pores of animal skins,) is divided into inconcievable tenuity; and when acted upon by the Sun's light appears to be decomposed; the hydrogene becomes a part of the vegetable, composing oils or resins; and the Oxygene combined with light or calo∣rique ascends, producing the pure part of the atmosphere or vital air. Hence during the light of the day vegetables give up more pure air than their respiration injures; but not so in the night, even though equally exposed to warmth. This single fact would seem to shew, that light is essentially different from heat; and it is perhaps by its combination with bodies, that their combined or latent heat is set at liberty, and becomes sensible.

The influence of electricity in forwarding the germination of plants and their growth seems to be pretty well established; though Mr. Ingenhouz did not succeed in his experiments, and thence doubts the success of those of others. And though M. Rouland from his new experiments believes, that neither positive nor nega∣tive electricity increases vegetation; both which philosophers had previously been sup∣porters of the contrary doctrine; for many other naturalists have since repeated their ex∣periments relative to this object, and their new results have confirmed their former ones. Mr. D'Ormoy and the two Roziers have found the same success in numerous experi∣ments which they have made in the last two years; and Mr. Carmoy has shewn in a convincing manner that electricity accelerates germination.</P>
<P>Mr. D'Ormoy not only found various seeds to vegetate sooner, and to grow taller which were put upon his insulated table and supplied with electricity, but also that silk∣worms began to spin much sooner which were kept electrified than those of the same hatch which were kept in the same place and manner, except that they were not elec∣trified. These experiments of M. D'Ormoy are detailed at length in the Journal de Physique of Rozier, Tom. XXXV. p. 270.</P>
<P>M. Bartholon, who had before written a tract on this subject, and proposed ingenious methods for applying electricity to agriculture and gardening, has also repeated a numerous set of experiments; and shews both that natural electricity, as well as the artificial, in∣creases the growth of plants, and the germination of seeds; and opposes Mr. Ingenhouz by very numerous and conclusive facts. Ib. Tom. XXXV. p. 401.</P>
<P>Since by the late discoveries or opinions of the Chemists there is reason to believe that water is decomposed in the vessels of vegetables; and that the Hydrogene or inflam∣mable air, of which it in part consists, contributes to the nourishment of the plant, and to the production of its oils, rosins, gums, sugar, &amp;c. and lastly as electricity decomposes water into these two airs termed Oxygene and Hydrogene, there is a powerful analogy to induce us to believe that it accelerates or contributes to the growth of vegetation, and like heat may possibly enter into combination with many bodies, or form the basis of some yet unanalised acid.</P></NOTE></L>

Fire-screens have been thus painted, which in the cold have shewn only the trunk and branches of a dead tree, and sandy hills, which on their approach to the fire have put forth green leaves and red flowers, and grass upon the mountains. The process of making these inks is very easy, take Zaffre, as sold by the druggists, and digest it in aqua regia, and the calx of Cobalt will be dissolved; which solution must be diluted with a little common water to prevent it from making too strong an impression on the paper; the colour when the paper is heated becomes of a fine green-blue. If Zaffre or Regulus of Cobalt be dissolved in the same manner in spirit of nitre, or aqua fortis, a reddish colour is produced on exposing the paper to heat. Chemical Dictionary by Mr. Keir, Art.

There are many reasons to believe from the accounts of travellers and navigators, that the islands of ice in the higher northern latitudes as well as the Glaciers on the Alps continue perpetually to increase in bulk. At certain times in the ice-mountains of Switzerland there happen cracks which have shewn the great thickness of the ice, as some of these cracks have measured three or four hundred ells deep. The great islands of ice in the northern seas near Hudson's bay have been ob∣served to have been immersed above one hundred fathoms beneath the surface of the sea, and to have risen a fifth or sixth part above the surface, and to have measured between three and four miles in circumference. Phil. Trans. No. 465. Sect. 2.</P>
<P>Dr. Lister endeavoured to shew that the ice of sea-water contains some salt and per∣haps less air than common ice, and that it is therefore much more difficult of solution; whence he accounts for the perpetual and great increase of these floating islands of ice. Philos. Trans. No. 169.</P>
<P>As by a famous experiment of Mr. Boyles it appears that ice evaporates very fast in severe frosty weather when the wind blows upon it; and as ice in a thawing state is known to contain six times more cold than water at the same degree of sensible coldness, it is easy to understand that winds blowing over islands and continents of ice perhaps much below nothing on Farenheit's scale, and coming from thence into our latitude must bring great degrees of cold along with them. If we add to this the quantity of cold pro∣duced by the evaporation of the water as well as by the solution of the ice, we cannot doubt but that the northern ice is the principle source of the coldness of our winters, and that it is brought hither by the regions of air blowing from the north, and which take an apparent easterly direction by their coming to a part of the surface of the earth which moves faster than the latitude they come from. Hence the increase of the ice in the polar regions by increasing the cold of our climate adds at the same time to the bulk of the Glaciers of Italy and Switzerland.</P>
<P>If the nations who inhabit this hemisphere of the globe, instead of destroying their sea-men and exhausting their wealth in unnecessary wars, could be induced to unite their labours to navigate these immense masses of ice into the more southern oceans, two great advantages would result to mankind, the tropic countries would be much cooled by their solution, and our winters in this latitude would be rendered much milder for perhaps a century or two, till the masses of ice became again enormous.</P>
<P>Mr. Bradley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ribes the cold winds and wet weather which sometimes happen in May and June to the solution of ice-islands accidentally floating from the north. Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening, Vol. II. p. 437. And adds, that Mr. Barham about the year 1718, in his voyage from Jamaica to England in the beginning of June, met with ice-islands coming from the north, which were surrounded with so great a fog that the ship was in danger of striking upon them, and that one of them measured sixty miles in length.</P>
<P>We have lately experienced an instance of ice-islands brought from the Southern polar regions, on which the Guardian struck at the beginning of her passage from the Cape of Good Hope towards Botany Bay, on December 22, 1789. These islands were involved in mist, were about one hundred and fifty fathoms long, and about fifty fathoms above the surface of the water. A part from the top of one of them broke off and fell into the sea, causing an extraordinary commotion in the water and a thick smoke all round it.</P></NOTE></L>

The solution of water in air or in calorique, seems to acquire electric matter at the same time, as appears from an experiment of Mr. Bennet. He put some live coals into an insulated funnel of metal, and throwing on them a little water observed that the ascending steam was electrised plus, and the water which de∣scended through the funnel was electrised minus. Hence it appears that though clouds by their change of form may sometimes become electrised minus yet they have in general an accumulation of electricity. This accumulation of electric matter also evidently con∣tributes to support the atmospheric vapour when it is condensed into the form of clouds, because it is seen to descend rapidly after the flashes of lightning have diminished its quantity; whence there is reason to conclude that very numerous metallic rods with fine points erected high in the air might induce it at any time to part with some of its water.</P>
<P>If we may trust the theory of Mr. Lavoisier concerning the composition and decom∣position of water, there would seem another source of thunder-showers; and that is, that the two gasses termed oxygene gas or vital air, and hydrogene gas or inflammable air, may exist in the summer atmosphere in a state of mixture but not of combination, and that the electric spark or flash of lightning may combine them and produce water instantaneously.</P></NOTE></L>

The granite, or moor-stone, or porphory, con∣stitute the oldest part of the globe, since the limestone, shells, coralloids, ond other sea-productions rest upon them; and upon these sea-productions are found clay, iron, coal, salt, and siliceous sand or grit-stone. Thus there seem to be three divisions of the globe distinctly marked; the first I suppose to have been the original nucleus of the earth, or lava projected from the sun; 2. over this lie the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced in the ocean; and, 3. over these the recrements of animal and vegetable matter produced upon the land. Besides these there are bodies which owe their origin to a combination of those already mentioned, as siliceous sand, fluor, alabaster; which seem to have derived their acids originally from the vegetable kingdom, and their earthy bases from sea-productions.

The nucleus of the earth, still covered with water, received perpetual increase by the immense quantities of shells and coralloids either annually produced and relinquished, or left after the death of the animals. These would gradually by their different degrees of cohesion be some of them more and others less removable by the influence of solar tides, and gentle tropical breezes, which then must have probably extended from one pole to the other; for it is supposed the moon was not yet produced, and that no storms or unequal winds had yet existence.</P>
<P>Hence then the primeval islands had their gradual origin, were raised but a few feet above the level of the sea, and were not exposed to the great or sudden variations of heat and cold, as is so well explained in Mr. Whithurst's Theory of the Earth, chap. xvi. Whence the paradise of the sacred writers, and the golden age of the profane ones, seems to have had a real existence. As there can be no rainbow, when the heavens are covered with clouds, because the sun-beams are then precluded from falling upon the rain-drops opposite to the eye of the spectator, the rainbow is a mark of gentle or partial showers. Mr. Whitehurst has endeavoured to show that the primitive islands were only moistened by nocturnal dews and not by showers, as occurs at this day to the Delta of Egypt; and is thence of opinion, that the rainbow had no existence till after the production of mountains and continents. As the salt of the sea has been gradually accumulating, being washed down into it from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies, the sea must originally have been as fresh as river water; and as it is not yet saturated with salt, must become annually more saline.

As the earth before the existence of earthquakes was nearly level, and the greatest part of it covered with sea; when the first great fires began deep in the internal parts of it, those parts would become much expanded; this expansion would be gradually extended, as the heat increased, through the whole terraqueous globe of 7000 miles diameter; the crust would thence in many places open into fissures, which by admitting the sea to flow in upon the fire, would produce not only a quantity of steam beyond calculation by its expansion, but would also by its decomposition produce inflammable air and vital air in quantities beyond conception, sufficient to effect those violent explosions, the vestiges of which all over the world excite our admiration and our study; the difficulty of understanding how subterraneous fires could exist without the presence of air has disappeared since Dr. Priestley's discoveries of such great quantities of pure air which constitute all the acids, and consequently exist in all saline bodies, as sea-salt, nitre, lime-stone, and in all calciform ores, as manganese, calamy, ochre, and other mineral substances. See an ingenious treatise by Mr. Michel on earthquakes in the Philos. Trans.</P>
<P>In these first tremendous ignitions of the globe, as the continents were heaved up, the vallies, which now hold the sea, were formed by the earth subsiding into the cavities made by the rising mountains; as the steam, which raised them condensed; which would thence not have any caverns of great extent remain beneath them, as some philosophers have imagined. The earthquakes of modern days are of very small extent indeed compared to those of antient times, and are ingeniously compared by M. De Luc to the operations of a mole-hill, where from a small cavity are raised from time to time small quantities of lava or pumice stone. Monthly Review, June, 1790.</P></NOTE></L>

If the moon had no atmosphere at the time of its elevation from the earth; or if its atmosphere was afterwards stolen from it by the earth's attraction; the water on the moon would rise quickly into vapour; and the cold produced by a certain quantity of this evaporation would congeal the remainder of it. Hence it is not probable that the moon is at present inhabited, but as it seems to have suffered and to continue to suffer much by volcanos, a sufficient quantity of air may in process of time be generated to produce an atmosphere; which may prevent its heat from so easily escaping, and its water from so easily evaporating, and thence become fit for the production of vegetables and animals.</P>
<P>That the moon possesses little or no atmosphere is deduced from the undiminished lustre of the stars, at the instant when they emerge from behind her disk. That the ocean of the moon is frozen, is confirmed from there being no appearance of lunar tides; which, if they existed, would cover the part of her disk nearest the earth.

The lime-stone rocks have had their origin from shells formed beneath the sea, the softer strata gradually dissolving and filling up the interstices of the harder ones, afterwards when these accumulations of shells were elevated above the waters the upper strata became dissolved by the actions of the air and dews, and filled up the interstices beneath, producing solid rocks of different kinds from the coarse lime-stones to the finest marbles. When those lime-stones have been in such a situation that they could form perfect crystals they are called spars, some of which possess a double refraction, as observed by Sir Isaac Newton. When these crystals are jumbled together or mixed with some colouring impurities it is termed marble, if its texture be equable and firm; if its texture be coarse and porous yet hard, it is called lime-stone; if its texture be very loose and porous it is termed chalk. In some rocks the shells remain almost unchanged and only covered, or bedded with lime-stone, which seems to have been dissolved and sunk down amongst them. In others the softer shells and bones are dissolved, and only sharks teeth or harder echini have preserved their form inveloped in the chalk or lime-stone; in some marbles the solution has been compleat and no vestiges of shell appear, as in the white kind called statuary by the workmen.

Salts of various kinds are produced from the recre∣ments of animal and vegetable bodies, such as phosphoric, ammoniacal, marine salt, and others; these are washed from the earth by rains, and carried down our rivers into the sea; they seem all here to decompose each other except the marine salt, which has there∣fore from the beginning of the habitable world been perpetually accumulating.</P>
<P>There is a town in the immense salt-mines of Cracow in Poland, with a market∣place, a river, a church, and a famous statue, (here supposed to be of Lot's wife) by the moist or dry appearance of which the subterranean inhabitants are said to know when the weather is fair above ground. The galleries in these mines are so numerous and so intricate, that workmen have frequently lost their way, their lights having been burnt out, and have perished before they could be found. Essais, &amp;c. par M. Macquart. And though the arches of these different stories of galleries are boldly executed, yet they are not dangerous; as they are held together or supported by large masses of timber of a foot square; and these vast timbers remain perfectly sound for many centuries, while all other pillars whether of brick, cement, or salt soon dissolve or moulder away. Ibid. Could the timbers over water-mill wheels or cellars, be thus preserved by occasionally soaking them with brine? These immense masses of rock-salt seem to have been produced by the evaporation of sea-water in the early periods of the world by subterranean fires. Dr. Hutton's Theory of the Earth. See also Theorie des Sources Salees, par Mr. Struve. Histoire de Sciences de Lausanne. Tom. II. This idea of Dr. Hutton's is confirmed by a fact mentioned in M. Macquart's Essais sur Minerologie, who found a great quantity of fossil shells, principally bi-valves and madre-pores, in the salt-mines of Wialiczka near Cracow. During the evaporation of the lakes of salt-water, as in artificial salt-works, the salt begins to crystallize near the edges where the water is shallowest, forming hollow inverted pyramids; which, when they become of a certain size, subside by their gravity; if urged by a stronger fire the salt fuses or forms large cubes; whence the salt shaped in hollow pyramids, called flake-salt, is better tasted and preserves flesh better, than the basket or powder salt; because it is made by less heat and thence contains more of the marine acid. The sea-water about our island contains from about one twenty-eighth to one thirtieth part of sea-salt, and about one eightieth of magnesian salt. See Brownrigg on Salt.

Nitre is found in Bengal naturally crystallized, and is swept by brooms from earths and stones, and thence called sweepings of nitre. It has lately been found in large quantities in a natural bason of calcareous earth at Molfetta in Italy, both in thin strata between the calcareous beds, and in efflorescences of various beautiful leafy and hairy forms. An account of this nitre-bed is given by Mr. Zimmerman and abridged in Rozier's Journal de Physique Fevrier. 1790. This acid appears to be produced in all situations where animal and vegetable matters are com∣pleatly decomposed, and which are exposed to the action of the air as on the walls of stables, and slaughter-houses; the crystals are prisms furrowed by longitudinal groves.</P>
<P>Dr. Priestley discovered that nitrous air or gas which he obtained by dissolving metals in nitrous acid, would combine rapidly with vital air, and produce with it a true nitrous acid; forming red clouds during the combination; the two airs occupy only the space before occupied by one of them, and at the same time heat is given out from the new combination. This dimunition of the bulk of a mixture of nitrous gas and vital air, Dr. Priestley ingeniously used as a test of the purity of the latter; a discovery of the greatest importance in the analysis of airs.</P>
<P>Mr. Cavendish has since demonstrated that two parts of vital air or oxygene, and one part of phlogistic air or azote, being long exposed to electric shocks, unite, and produce nitrous acid. Philos. Trans. Vols. LXXV. and LXXVIII.</P>
<P>Azote is one of the most abundant elements in nature, and combined with calorique or heat, it forms azotic gas or phlogistic air, and composes two thirds of the atmosphere; and is one of the principal component parts of animal bodies, and when united to vital air or oxygene produces the nitrous acid. Mr. Lavoisier found that 211/2 parts by weight of azote, and 431/2 parts of oxygene produced 64 parts of nitrous gas, and by the further addition of 36 parts of oxygene nitrous acid was produced Traité de Chimie. When two airs become united so as to produce an unelastic liquid much calorique or heat is of necessity expelled from the new combination, though perhaps nitrous acid and oxygenated marine acid admit more heat into their combinations than other acids.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>III. "HENCE dusky IRON sleeps in dark abodes,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Hence dusky Iron.</HI> l. 183. The production of iron from the decomposition of vege∣table bodies is perpetually presented to our view; the waters oozing from all morasses are chalybeate, and deposit their ochre on being exposed to the air, the iron acquiring a calciform state from its union with oxygene or vital air. Where thin morasses lie on beds of gravel the latter are generally stained by the filtration of some of the chalybeate water through them. This formation of iron from vegetable recrements is further evinced by the fern leaves and other parts of vegetables, so frequently found in the centre of the knobs or nodules of some iron-ores.</P>
<P>In some of these nodules there is a nucleus of whiter iron-earth surrounded by many concentric strata of darker and lighter iron-earth alternately. In one, which now lies before me, the nucleus is a prism of a triangular form with blunted angles, and about half an inch high, and an inch and half broad; on every side of this are concentric strata of similar iron-earth alternately browner and less brown; each stratum is about a tenth of an inch in thickness and there are ten of them in number. To what known cause can this exactly regular distribution of so many earthy strata of different colours surrounding the nucleus be ascribed? I dont know that any mineralogists have attempted an explanation of this wonderful phenomenon. I suspect it is owing to the polarity of the central nucleus. If iron-filings be regularly laid on paper by means of a small sieve, and a magnet be placed underneath, the filings will dispose themselves in concentric curves with vacant intervals between them. Now if these iron-filings are conceived to be suspended in a fluid, whose specific gravity is similar to their own, and a magnetic bar was introduced as an axis into this fluid, it is easy to foresee that the iron filings would dispose themselves into concentric spheres, with intervals of the circumnatant fluid between them, exactly as is seen, in these nodules of iron-earth. As all the lavas consist of one fourth of iron, (Kirvan's Mineral) and almost all other known bodies, whether of animal or vegetable origin, possess more or less of this property, may not the distribu∣tion of a great portion of the globe of the earth into strata of greater or less regularity be owing to the polarity of the whole?</P></NOTE></L>

It was the discovery of this property of iron, Mr. Locke thinks, that gave such pre-eminence to the European world over the American one. 2. Its power of being welded; that is, when two pieces are made very hot and applied together by hammering, they unite compleatly, unless any scale of iron in∣tervenes; and to prevent this it is usual for smiths to dip the very hot bar in sand, a little of which fuses into fluid glass with the scale and is squeezed out from between the uniting parts by the force of hammering. 3. Its power of acquiring magnetism.</P>
<P>It is however to be wished that gold or silver were discovered in as great quantity as iron, since these metals being indestructible by exposure to air, water, fire or any com∣mon acids would supply wholesome vessels for cookery, so much to be desired, and so difficult to obtain, and would form the most light and durable coverings for houses, as well as indestructible fire-grates, ovens, and boiling vessels.

<L>"Last MICHELL's hands with touch of potent charm<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Last Michell's hands.</HI> 1. 193. The discovery of the magnet seems to have been in very early times; it is mentioned by Plato, Lucretius, Pliny, and Galen, and is said to have taken its name of magnes from Magnesia, a sea-port of antient Lybia.</P>
<P>As every piece of iron which was made magnetical by the touch of a magnet became itself a magnet, many attempts were made to improve these artificial magnets, but with∣out much success till Servingdon Savary, Esq. made them of <HI>hardened</HI> steel bars, which were so powerful that one of them weighing three pounds averdupois would lift another of the same weight. Philos. Trans.</P>
<P>After this Dr. Knight made very successful experiments on this subject, which, though he kept his method secret, seems to have excited others to turn their attention to magnetism. At this time the Rev. Mr. Michell invented an equally efficacious and more expeditious way of making strong artificial magnets, which he published in the end of the year 1750, in which he explained his method of what he called <Q>the double touch,</Q> and which, since Mr. Knight's method has been known, appears to be somewhat dif∣ferent from it.</P>
<P>This method of rendering bars of hardened steel magnetical consists in holding verti∣cally two or more magnetic bars nearly parallel to each other with their opposite poles very near each other, (but nevertheless separated to a small distance,) these are to be slided over a line of bars laid horizontally a few times backward and forward. See Michell on Magnetism, also a detailed account in Chamber's Dictionary.</P>
<P>What Mr. Michell proposed by this method was to include a very small portion of the horizontal bars, intended to be made magnetical, between the joint forces of two or more bars already magnetical, and by sliding them from end to end every part of the line of bars became successively included, and thus bars possessed of a very small degree of magnetism to begin with, would in a few times sliding backwards and forwards make the other ones much more magnetical than themselves, which are then to be taken up and used to touch the former, which are in succession to be laid down horizontally in a line.</P>
<P>There is still a great field remains for future discoveries in magnetism both in respect to experiment and theory; the latter consists of vague conjectures the more probable of which are perhaps those of Elpinus, as they assimulate it to electricity. One conjecture I shall add, viz. that the polarity of magnetism may be owing to the earth's rotatory motion. If heat, electricity, and magnetism are supposed to be fluids of different gravities, heat being the heaviest of them, electricity the next heavy, and mag∣netism the lightest, it is evident that by the quick revolution of the earth the heat will be accumulated most over the line, electricity next beneath this, and that the magnetism will be detruded to the poles and axis of the earth, like the atmospheres of common air and of inflammable gas, as explained in the note on Canto I. l. 123.</P>
<P>Electricity and heat will both of them displace magnetism, and this shews that they may gravitate on each other; and hence when too great a quantity of the electric fluid becomes accumulated at the poles by descending snows, or other unknown causes, it may have a tendency to rise towards the tropics by its centrifugal force, and produce the northern lights.

<L>IV. "HENCE in fine streams diffusive ACIDS flow,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Diffusive Acids flow.</HI> l. 215. The production of marine acid from decomposing vege∣table and animal matters with vital air, and of nitrous acid from azote and vital air, the former of which is united to its basis by means of the exhalations from vegetable and animal matters, constitute an analogy which induces us to believe that many other acids have either their bases or are united to vital air by means of some part of decomposing vegetable and animal matters.</P>
<P>The great quantities of flint sand whether formed in mountains or in the sea would appear to derive its acid from the new world, as it is found above the strata of lime-stone and granite which constitute the old world, and as the earthy basis of flint is probably calcareous, a great part of it seems to be produced by a conjunction of the new and old world; the recrements of air-breathing animals and vegetables probably afford the acid, and the shells of marine animals the earthy basis, while another part may have derived its calcareous part also from the decomposition of vegetable and animal bodies.</P>
<P>The same mode of reasoning seems applicable to the siliceous stones under various names, as amethyst, onyx, agate, mochoe, opal, &amp;c. which do not seem to have undergone any process from volcanic fires, and as these stones only differ from flint by a greater or less admixture of argillaceous and calcareous earths.

Sir Isaac Newton having observed the great power of refracting light, which the diamond possesses above all other crystallized or vitreous matter, conjectured that it was an inflammable body in some manner congealed. Insomuch that all the light is reflected which falls on any of its interior surfaces at a greater angle of incidence than 24 ½ degrees; whereas an artificial gem of glass does not reflect any light from its hinder surface, unless that surface is inclined in an angle of 41 degrees. Hence the diamond reflects half as much more light as a factitious gem in similar circum∣stances; to which must be added its great transparency, and the excellent polish it is capable of. The diamond had nevertheless been placed at the head of crystals or precious stones by the mineralogists, till Bergman ranged it of late in the combustible class of bodies, because by the focus of Villette's burning mirror it was evaporated by a heat not much greater than will melt silver, and gave out light. Mr. Hoepfner however thinks the dispersion of the diamond by this great heat should be called a phosphorescent eva∣poration of it, rather than a combustion; and from its other analogies of crystallization, hardness, transparency, and place of its nativity, wishes again to replace it amongst the precious stones.

The times of its greatest splendour were prior to the foundations of Rome, and the reign of one of its best princes, Janus, was the oldest epoch the Romans knew. The earliest historians speak of the Etruscans as being then of high antiquity, most probably a colony from Phoenicia, to which a Pelasgian colony acceded, and was united soon after Deucalion's flood. The peculiar character of their earthern vases consists in the admi∣rable beauty, simplicity, and diversity of forms, which continue the best models of taste to the artists of the present times; and in a species of non-vitreous encaustic painting, which was reckoned, even in the time of Pliny, among the lost arts of antiquity, but which has lately been recovered by the ingenuity and industry of Mr. Wedgwood. It is supposed that the principal manufactories were about Nola, at the foot of Vesuvius; for it is in that neighbourhood that the greatest quantities of antique vases have been found; and it is said that the general taste of the inhabitants is apparently influenced by them; insomuch that strangers coming to Naples, are commonly struck with the diversity and elegance even of the most ordinary vases for common uses.

Coal has probably all been sublimed more or less from the clay, with which it was at first formed in decomposing morasses; the petroleum seems to have been separated and condensed again in superior strata, and a still finer kind of oil, as naphtha, has probably had the same origin. Some of these liquid oils have again lost their more volatile parts, and become cannel-coal, asphaltum, jet, and amber, according to the purity of the original fossil oil. Dr. Priestley has shewn, that essential oils long exposed to the atmosphere absorb both the vital and phlogistic part of it; whence it is probable their becoming solid may in great measure depend, as well as by the exhalation of their more volatile parts. On distillation with volatile alcaly all these fossil oils are shewn to contain the acid of amber, which evinces the identity of their origin.

Bergman has likewise shewn, that the limestones which become bluish or dark coloured when calcined, possess a mixture of manganese, and are thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime. 2. Bergman, 229. Which impregnation with manganese has probably been re∣ceived from the decomposition of superincumbent vegetable matters.</P>
<P>These cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limestone pass to unknown depths; and it is up these channels that I have endeavoured to shew that the steam rises which becomes afterwards condensed and produces the warm springs of this island, and other parts of the world. (See note on Fucus, Vol. II.) And up these cracks I suppose certain vapours arise, which either alone, or by meeting with something descending into them from above, have produced most of the metals; and several of the materials in which they are bedded. Thus the ponderous earth, Barytes, of Derbysbire, is found in these cracks, and is stratified frequently with lead-ore, and frequently surrounds it. This ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland, and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by great heat, and have obtained its car∣bonic or vitriolic acid from above. Annales de Chimie. There is also reason to con∣clude that something from above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals: at Hawkstone in Shropshire, the seat of Sir Richard Hill, there is an elevated rock of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air; and I have in my possession a specimen of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule, and another of lead amid spar from a crack of a coal-stratum; all which countenance the modern pro∣duction of those metals from descending materials. To which should be added, that the highest mountains of granite, which have therefore probably never been covered with marine productions on account of their early elevation, nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their great coldness, contain no metallic ores, whilst the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins, both in Saxony, Silesia, and Cornwall. Kirwan's Mineral. p. 374.</P>
<P>The transmutation of one metal into another, though hitherto undiscovered by the alchymists, does not appear impossible; such transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature, thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of lead-ore, as it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead, where it has been calcined or united with air, and because masses of lead-ore are often found intirely inclosed in it. So silver is found mixed in almost all lead-ores, and sometimes in seperate filaments within the cavities of lead-ore, as I am informed by Mr. Michell, and is thence probably a partial transmutation of the lead to silver, the rapid progress of modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic calces and acids, may lead to the power of trans∣muting their bases: a discovery much to be wished.</P></NOTE></L>

We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely one of the most magnificent in the world. In that vast expanse of desert, from W. to N. W. of us, we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at dif∣ferent distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others stalking on with a majestic slowness; at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often separated from the bodies; and these, once disjoined, dispersed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle, as if struck with large cannon-shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged along side of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name, though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment. It was in vain to think of flying; the swiftest horse, or fastest sailing ship, could be of no use to carry us out of this danger; and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood.</P>
<P>The same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at Waadi Halboub, only they seemed to be more in number and less in size. They came several times in a direction close upon us, that is, I believe, within less than two miles. They began immediately after sun rise like a thick wood and almost darkened the sun. His rays shining through them for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became desperate, the Greeks shrieked out and said it was the day of judgment; Ismael pronounced it to be hell; and the Turcorories, that the world was on fire.</P><BIBL>Bruce's Travels, Vol. IV. p. 553,—555.</BIBL></Q>
<P>From this account it would appear, that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks, which bounded one side of the sandy desert, and bent the currents of air, which struck against their sides; and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water, which falls against oblique obstacles. This explanation is probably the true one, as these whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes of the West-Indies.</P></NOTE></L>

The perpetual circulation of matter in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies seems to have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis or transmigration of spirit; which was afterwards dressed out or ridiculed in variety of amusing fables. Other philosophers have supposed, that there are two different materials or essences, which fill the universe. One of these, which has the power of commencing or producing motion, is called spirit; the other, which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion, but not of beginning it, is called matter. The former of these is supposed to be diffused through all space, filling up the interstices of the suns and planets, and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal bodies, the attractions of chemistry, with the spirit of vegetation, and of animation. The latter occupies comparatively but small space, constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets, and their atmospheres. Hence these philosophers have supposed, that both matter and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable; and that on the dissolution of vegetable or animal organization, the matter returns to the general mass of matter; and the spirit to the general mass of spirit, to enter again into new combinations, according to the original idea of Pythagoras.</P>
<P>The small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe compared to that of spirit, and the short time in which the recrements of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of vegetable mucor or microscopic insects, seems to have given rise to another curious fable of antiquity.

The very antient story of the beautiful Adonis passing one half of the year with Venus, and the other with Proserpine alternately, has had variety of interpretations. Some have supposed that it allegorized the summer and winter solstice; but this seems too obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem. Others have believed it to represent the corn, which was supposed to sleep in the earth during the winter months, and to rise out of it in summer. This does not accord with the climate of Egypt, where the harvest soon follows the seed-time.</P>
<P>It seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic figures re∣presenting the decomposition and resuscitation of animal matter; a sublime and interest∣ing subject, and which seems to have given origin to the doctrine of the transmigration, which had probably its birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of Egypt. It is re∣markable that the cypress groves in the antient greek writers, as in Theocritus, were dedicated to Venus; and afterwards became funereal emblems. Which was probably occasioned by the Cypress being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual processions, in which she was supposed to lament over the funeral of Adonis; a ceremony which obtained over all the eastern world from great antiquity, and is supposed to be referred to by Ezekiel, who accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>On each broad cloud a thousand sails expand,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>On each broad cloud.</HI> l. 15. The clouds consist of condensed vapour, the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity of the air, and which therefore do not descend. They are in such small spheres as to repel each other, that is, they are applied to each other by such very small surfaces, that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the surface of the drop in its vicinity; every one has observed with what difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite, owing to the same cause; and it is common to see on riding through shallow water on a clear day, numbers of very small spheres of water as they are thrown from the horses feet run along the surface for many yards before they again unite with it. In many cases these spherules of water, which compose clouds, are kept from uniting by a surplus of electric fluid; and fall in violent showers as soon as that is withdrawn from them, as in thunder storms. See note on Canto l. 1. 554.</P>
<P>If in this state a cloud becomes frozen, it is torn to pieces in its descent by the friction of the air, and falls in white flakes of snow. Or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds, and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they descend; and part of the water produced by these angles thus dissolved is absorbed into the body of the hailstone, as may be seen by holding a lump of snow over a candle, and there becomes frozen into ice by the quantity of cold which the hailstone possesses beneath the freezing point, or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling; and thus hailstones are often found of greater or less density according as they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice. If hailstones consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent, they would consist of pure transparent ice.</P>
<P>As hail is only produced in summer, and is always attended with storms, some philo∣sophers have believed that the sudden departure of electriclty from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon; but it may happen in summer independent of electricity, because the aqueous vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere, whence it has further to fall, and there is warmer air below for it to fall through.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="15"/></L>

During the coldness of the night the moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated, and as it subsides adheres to the bodies it falls upon. Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of those particles to each other, it becomes spread upon their surface, or slides down them in actual contact; as on the broad parts of the blades of moist grass: where the attraction of the surface to the water is less than the attraction of the particles of water to each other, the dew stands in drops; as on the points and edges of grass or gorse, where the surface presented to the drop being small it attracts it so little as but just to support it without much changing its globular form: where there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops, as on cabbage leaves, the drop does not come into contact with the leaf, but hangs over it repelled, and retains it natural form, com∣posed of the attraction and pressure of its own parts, and thence looks like quicksilver, reflecting light from both its surfaces. Nor is this owing to any oiliness of the leaf, but simply to the polish of its surface, as a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching it; for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when in actual contact, so the repulsive power is greater before contact.</P></NOTE></L>

Mists are clouds resting on the ground, they generally come on at the beginning of night, and either fill the moist vallies, or hang on the summits of hills, according to the degree of moisture previously dissolved, and the education of heat from them. The air over rivers during the warmth of the day suspends much moisture, and as the changeful surface of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than the land at the approach of evening, mists are most frequently seen to begin over rivers, and to spread themselves over moist grounds, and fill the vallies, while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds, condensed by the coldness of their situation.</P>
<P>On ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley, I have observed a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickness of mist was over me, which ceased to be visible as soon as I emerged out of it; and well remember admiring with other spectators the shadow of the three spires of the cathedral church at Lichfield, the moon rising behind it, apparently broken off, and lying distinctly over our heads as if horizontally on the surface of the mist, which arose about as high as the roof of the church. There are some curious remarks on shadows or reflections seen on the surface of mists from high mountains in Ulloa's Voyages. The dry mist of summer 1783, was probably occasioned by volcanic eruption, as mentioned in note on Chunda, Vol. II. and therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days over great cities.</P>
<P>There is a dry mist, or rather a diminished transparence of the air, which according to Mr. Saussure accompanies fair weather, while great transparence of air indicates rain. Thus when large rivers two miles broad, such as at Liverpool, appear narrow, it is said to prognosticate rain; and when wide, fair weather. This want of transparence of the air in dry weather, may be owing to new combinations or decompositions of the vapours dissolved in it, but wants further investigation.

The phenomena of the tides have been well investigated and satisfactorily explained by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth, moon, and sun. As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth's surface, at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the sun, it follows that the water on the side of the earth nearest this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more attracted by the moon, and the waters on the opposite side of the earth will be less attracted by the moon, than the central parts of the earth. Add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the side of the earth furthest from the centre of the motion, round which the earth and moon move, (which, as was said before, is near the surface of the earth) is greater than that on the opposite side of the earth, From both these causes it is easy to comprehend that the water will rise on two sides of the earth, viz. on that nearest to the moon, and its opposite side, and that it will be flattened in consequence at the quadratures, and thus produce two tides in every lunar day, which consists of about twenty-four hours and forty-eight minutes.</P>
<P>These tides will be also affected by the solar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one, or opposes it, as at new and full moon, and will also be much influenced by the opposing shores in every part of the earth.</P>
<P>Now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between itself and the earth describes a much larger orbit than the earth describes round the same centre, it follows that the centrifugal motion on the side of the moon opposite to the earth must be much greater than the centrifugal motion of the side of the earth opposite to the moon round the same centre, And secondly, as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon's surface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth's surface, the tides on the lunar sea, (if such there be,) should be much greater than those of our ocean. Add to this that as the same face of the moon always is turned to the earth, the lunar tides must be permanent, and if the solid parts of the moon be spherical, must always cover the phasis next to us. But as there are evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this side of the moon, the consequence is that the moon has no ocean, or that it is frozen.</P></NOTE></L>

The spiral form of many shells seem to have afforded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fish with calcareous armour; since a single thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fish was sufficient to defend both sur∣faces, and thus much cretaceous matter is saved; and it is probable that from this spiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exist. See note on Canto IV. l. 162. This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous secretion from the skin of the fish, as is seen in crab-fish, and others which annually cast their shells, and is at first a soft mucous covering, (like that of a hen's egg, when it is laid a day or two too soon,) and which gradually hardens. This may also be seen in common shell snails, if a part of their shell be broken it becomes repaired in a similar manner with mucus, which by degrees hardens into shell.</P>
<P>It it probable the calculi or stones found in other animals may have a similar origin, as they are formed on mucous membranes, as those of the kidney and bladder, chalk-stones in the gout, and gall-stones; and are probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced, and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them, and the kind of mucous which it naturally produces. Thus the shelly matter of different shell-fish differs, from the courser kinds which form the shells of crabs, to the finer kinds which produces the mother-pearl.</P>
<P>The beautiful colours of some shells originate from the thinness of the laminae of which they consist, rather than to any colouring matter, as is seen in mother-pearl, which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it. The beautiful prismatic colours seen on the Labrodore stone are owing to a similar cause, viz. the thinness of the laminae of which it consists, and has probably been formed from mother-pearl shells.</P>
<P>It is curious that some of the most common fossil shells are not now known in their recent state, as the cornua ammonis; and on the contrary, many shells which are very plentiful in their recent state, as limpets, sea-ears, volutes, cowries, are very rarely found fossil.

Mr. Reaumur thinks they are formed like the hard concretions in many land animals as stones of the bladder, gall-stones, and bezoar, and hence concludes them to be a disease of the fish, but there seems to be a stricter analogy between these and the calcareous productions found in crab-fish called crab's eyes, which are formed near the stomach of the animal, and constitute a reservoir of calcareous matter against the renovation of the shell, at which time they are re-dissolved and deposited for that purpose. As the internal part of the shell of the pearl oyster or muscle consists of mother-pearl which is a similar material to the pearl and as the animal has annually occasion to enlarge his shell there is reason to suspect the loose pearls are similar reservoirs of the pearly matter for that purpose.</P></NOTE></L>

Water in descending down elevated situations if the outlet for it below is not sufficient for its emission acts with a force equal to the height of the column, as is seen in an experimental machine called the philosophical bellows, in which a few pints of water are made to raise many hundred pounds. To this cause is to be ascribed many large promontories of ice being occasionally thrown down from the glaciers; rocks have likewise been thrown from the sides of mountains by the same cause, and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their situations at the foot of mountains. On inspecting the locomotion of about thirty acres of earth with a small house near Bilder's Bridge in Shropshire, about twenty years ago, from the foot of a mountain towards the river, I well remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up, pushed away, and as it were crumpled into ridges, by a column of water contained in the mountain.</P>
<P>From water being thus confined in high columns between the strata of mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or perforations have been made into the earth, that springs have arisen much above the surface of the new well. When the new bridge was building at Dublin Mr. G. Semple found a spring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre, which, by fixing iron pipes into it, he raised many feet. Treatise on Building in Water, by G. Semple. From having observed a valley north-west of St. Alkmond's well near Derby, at the head of which that spring of water once probably existed, and by its current formed the valley, (but which in after times found its way out in its present situation,) I suspect that St. Alkmond's well might by building round it be raised high enough to supply many streets in Derby with spring-water which are now only supplied with river-water. See an account of an artificial spring of water, Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV. p. 1.</P>
<P>In making a well at Sheerness the water rose 300 feet above its source in the well. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXIV. And at Hartford in Connecticut there is a well which was dug seventy feet deep before water was found, then in boring an augur-hole through a rock the water rose so fast as to make it difficult to keep it dry by pumps till they could blow the hole larger by gunpowder, which was no sooner accomplished than it filled and run over, and has been a brook for near a century.

When from any peculiar situations of land in respect to sea the tropic becomes more heated, when the sun is vertical over it, than the line, the periodical winds called monsoons are produced, and these are attended by rainy seasons; for as the air at the tropic is now more heated than at the line it ascends by decrease of its specific gravity, and floods of air rush in both from the South West and North East, and these being one warmer than the other the rain is precipitated by their mixture as observed by Dr. Hutton. See additional notes, No. XXV. All late travellers have as∣cribed the rise of the Nile to the monsoons which deluge Nubia and Abyssinia with rain. The whirling of the ascending air was even seen by Mr. Bruce in Abyssinia; he says, <Q>every morning a small cloud began to whirl round, and presently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds,</Q> by this vortex of ascending air the N. E. winds and the S. W. winds, which flow in to supply the place of the ascending column, became mixed more rapidly and deposited their rain in greater abundance.</P>
<P>Mr. Volney observes that the time of the rising of the Nile commences about the 19th of June, and that Abyssinia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May, June, and July, and produce a mass of water which is three months in draining off.

There seem to be two situations which may be con∣ceived to be exempted from rain falling upon them, one where the constant trade-winds meet beneath the line, for here two regions of warm air are mixed together, and thence do not seem to have any cause to precipitate their vapour; and the other is, where the winds are brought from colder climates and become warmer by their contact with the earth of a warmer one. Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the sun more than the higher lands of one side of it, and than the Mediterranean on the other; and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth, which ever way they come, than they possessed before, and in consequence have a tendency to acquire and not to part with their vapour like the north-east winds of this country. There is said to be a narrow spot upon the coast of Peru where rain seldom occurs, at the same time according to Ulloa on the mountainous regions of the Andes beyond there is almost perpetual rain. For the wind blows uniformly upon this hot part of the coast of Peru, but no cause of devaporation occurs till it begins to ascend the mountainous Andes, and then its own expansion produces cold sufficient to condense its vapour.</P></NOTE></L>

On cooling it deposited a siliceous matter or chalcedony forming a bason round its base. The heat of this water before it rose out of the earth could not be ascertained, as water looses all its heat above 212 (as soon as it is at liberty to expand) by the exhalation of a part, but the flinty bason which is deposited from it shews that water with great degrees of heat will dissolve siliceous matter.

Since the above account in the year 1780 this part of Iceland has been destroyed by an earthquake or covered with lava, which was probably effected by the force of aqueous steam, a greater quantity of water falling on the subterraneous fires than could escape by the antient outlets and generating an increased quantity of vapour.

The bath at Buxton being of 82 degrees of heat is called a warm bath, and is so compared with common spring-water which possesses but 48 degrees of heat, but is nevertheless a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is 98. On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the first immersion, but after having been in it a minute the chill ceases and a sensation of warmth succeeds though the body continues to be immersed in the water. The cause of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal sensation and not from any properties of heat. When a person goes from clear day-light into an obscure room for a while it appears gloomy, which gloom however in a little time ceases, and the de∣ficiency of light becomes no longer perceived. This is not solely owing to the enlarge∣ment of the iris of the eye, since that is performed in an instant, but to this law of sen∣sation, that when a less stimulus is applied (within certain bounds) the sensibility increases. Thus at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton, the diminu∣tion of heat on the skin is at first perceived, but in about a minute the sensibility to heat increases and the nerves of the skin are equally excited by the lessened stimulus. The sensation of warmth at emerging from a cold-bath, and the pain called the hot-ach, after the hands have been immersed in snow, depend on the same principle, viz. the increased sensibility of the skin after having been previously exposed to a stimulus less than usual.</P></NOTE></L>

Until very lately water was esteemed a simple element, nor are all the most celebrated chemists of Europe yet converts to the new opinion of its de∣composition. Mr. Lavoisier and others of the French school have most ingeniously endeavoured to shew that water consists of pure air, called by them oxygene, and of inflammable air, called hydrogene, with as much of the matter of heat, or calorique, as is necessary to preserve them in the form of gas. Gas is distinguished from steam by its preserving its elasticity under the pressure of the atmosphere, and in the greatest degrees of cold yet known. The history of the progress of this great discovery is detailed in the Memoires of the Royal Academy for 1781, and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoisier's Elements of Chemistry. The results of which are that water consists of eighty-five parts by weight of oxygene, and fifteen parts by weight of hydrogene, with a sufficient quantity of Calorique. Not only numerous chemical phe∣nomena, but many atmospherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beautiful eluci∣dation from this important analysis. In the atmosphere inflammable air is probably per∣petually uniting with vital air and producing moisture which descends in dews and showers, while the growth of vegetables by the assistance of light is perpetually again decomposing the water they imbibe from the earth, and while they retain the inflam∣mable air for the formation of oils, wax, honey, resin, &amp;c. they give up the vital air to replenish the atmosphere.</P></NOTE></L>

The foamy appearance of water, when the pressure of the air over it is diminished, is owing to the expansion and escape of the air previously dissolved by it, or existing in its pores.

Another kind of machine was invented by one Greyl, in which a vessel of water was every way dispersed by the explosion of gun-powder lodging in the centre of it, and lighted by an adapted match; from this idea Mr. Godfrey proposed a water-bomb of similar construction. Dr. Hales to prevent the spreading of fire proposed to cover the floors and stairs of the adjoining houses with earth; Mr. Hartley proposed to prevent houses from taking fire by covering the cieling with thin iron-plates, and Lord Mahon by a bed of coarse mortar or plaister between the cieling and floor above it.

The upper side of the leaf is the organ of vegetable respiration, as explained in the additional notes, No XXXVII, hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moisture on this surface, and is destroyed by being smeared with oil, in these respects resembling the lungs of animals or the spiracula of insects. To prevent these injuries some leaves repel the dew-drops from their upper surfaces as those of cabbages; other vegetables close the upper furfaces of their leaves together in the night or in wet weather, as the sensitive plant; others only hang their leaves downwards so as to shoot the wet from them, as kidney-beans, and many trees. See note on. 1. 18 of this Canto.</P></NOTE></L>
<L>And close the timorous floret's golden bell.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Golden bell.</HI> l. 440. There are muscles placed about the footstalks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants, for the purpose of closing their upper surfaces together, or of bending them down so as to shoot off the showers or dew-drops, as mentioned in the preceeding note. The claws of the petals or of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers are furnished in a similar manner with muscles, which are exerted to open or close the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon, anemone. This action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers does not appear to be produced simply by <HI>irritation</HI> on the muscles themselves, but by the connection of those muscles with a <HI>sensitive</HI> sensorium or brain existing in each individual bud or flower. 1st. Because many flowers close from the defect of stimulus, not by the excess of it, as by darkness, which is the absence of the stimulus of light; or by cold, which is the absence of the stimulus of heat. Now the defect of heat, or the absence of food, or of drink, affects our <HI>sensations,</HI> which had been previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them; but a muscle cannot be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of stimulus. 2. Because the muscles around the footstalks of the subdivisions of the leaves of the sensitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf, and some of the stamens of the flowers of the class Syngenesia contract themselves when others are irritated. See note on Chondrilla, Vol. II. of this work.</P>
<P>From this circumstance the contraction of the muscles of vegetables seems to depend on a disagreeable <HI>sensation</HI> in some distant part, and not on the <HI>irritation</HI> of the muscles themselves. Thus when a particle of dust stimulates the ball of the eye, the eye-lids are instantly closed, and when too much light pains the retina, the muscles of the iris contract its aperture, and this not by any connection or consent of the nerves of those parts, but as an effort to prevent or to remove a disagreeable sensation, which evinces that vegetables are endued with sensation, or that each bud has a common sensorium, and is furnished with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="440"/></L>

The practice of flooding lands long in use in China has been but lately introduced into this country. Besides the supplying water to the herbage in dryer seasons, it seems to defend it from frost in the early part of the year, and thus doubly advances the vegetation. The waters which rise from springs passing through marl or limestone are replete with calcareous earth, and when thrown over morasses they deposit this earth and incrust or consolidate the morass. This kind of earth is deposited in great quantity from the springs at Matlock bath, and supplies the soft porous limestone of which the houses and walls are there constructed; and has formed the whole bank for near a mile on that side of the Derwent on which they stand.</P>
<P>The water of many springs contains much azotic gas, or phlogistic air, besides car∣bonic gas, or fixed air, as that of Buxton and Bath; this being set at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of nitre by means of the putrescent matters which it is exposed to by being spread upon the surface of the land; in the same manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous process by imprisoning atmospheric air in the interstices of the putrescent materials. Water arising by land∣floods brings along with it much of the most soluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones. River-water in its clear state and those springs which are called soft are less beneficial for the purpose of watering lands, as they contain less earthy or saline matter; and water from dissolving snow from its slow solution brings but little earth along with it, as may be seen by the comparative clearness of the water of snow-floods.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="520"/></L>

The importance of the nectarium or honey-gland in the vegetable economy is seen from the very complicated apparatus, which nature has formed in some flowers for the preservation of their honey from insects, as in the aconites or monkshoods; in other plants instead of a great apparatus for its protection a greater secretion of it is produced that thence a part may be spared to the depredation of insects. The cacalia suaveolens produces so much honey that on some days it may be smelt at a great distance from the plant. I remember once counting on one of these plants besides bees of various kinds without number, above two hundred painted butterflies, which gave it the beautiful appearance of being covered with additional flowers.</P></NOTE></L>

The common air of the atmosphere appears by the analysis of Dr. Priestley and other philosophers to consist of about three parts of an elastic fluid unfit for respiration or combustion, called azote by the French school, and about one fourth of pure vital air fit for the support of animal life and of combustion, called oxygene. The principal source of the azote is probably from the decomposition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combustion; the principal source of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from the decomposition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the sun's light. The difficulty of injecting vegetable vessels seems to shew that their perspirative pores are much less than those of animals, and that the water which constitutes their perspiration is so divided at the time of its exclusion that by means of the sun's light it becomes decomposed, the inflammable air or hydrogene, which is one of its constituent parts, being retained to form the oil, resin, wax, honey, &amp;c. of the vegetable economy; and the other part, which united with light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas, rises into the atmosphere and replenishes it with the food of life.</P>
<P>Dr. Priestley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood gives out phlogiston, and receives vital air, or oxygene-gas by the lungs. And Dr. Crawford has shewn that the blood acquires heat from this vital air in respiration. There is however still a something more subtil than heat, which must be obtained in respiration from the vital air, a something which life can not exist a few minutes without, which seems necessary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world, and which as no or∣ganized vessels can confine it, requires perpetually to be renewed.

I saw from the S. E. a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow, but not so compressed or thick; it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of a blush upon the air, and it moved very rapidly, for I scarce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face. We all lay flat upon the ground, as if dead, till Idris told us it was blown over. The meteor, or purple haze, which I saw was indeed passed; but the light air that still blew was of heat to threaten suffocation. For my part I found distinctly in my breast, that I had imbibed a part of it; nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some months in Italy.</Q> <BIBL>Bruce's Travels. Vol. IV. p. 557.</BIBL></P>
<P>It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this pestilential wind, which is said not to exceed twenty yards, and for its small elevation of twelve feet. A whirlwind will pass forwards, and throw down an avenue of trees by its quick revolution as it passes, but nothing like a whirling is described as happening in these narrow streams of air, and whirlwinds ascend to greater heights. There seems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected, and that is by electricity.</P>
<P>The volcanic origin of these winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda in Vol. II. of this work; it must here be added, that Professor Vairo at Naples found, that during the eruption of Vesuvius perpendicular iron bars were electric; and others have observed suffocating damps to attend these eruptions. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 133. And lastly, that a current of air attends the passage of electric matter, as is seen in presenting an electrized point to the flame of a candle. In Mr. Bruce's account of this simoom, it was in its course over a quite dry desert of sand, (and which was in consequence unable to conduct an electric stream into the earth beneath it,) to some moist rocks at but a few miles distance; and thence would appear to be a stream of electricity from a volcano attended with noxious air; and as the bodies of Mr. Bruce and his attendants were insulated on the sand, they would not be sensible of their increased electricity, as it passed over them; to which it may be added, that a sulphurous or suffocating sensation is said to accompany flashes of lightning, and even strong sparks of artificial electricity. In the above account of the simoom, a great redness in the air is said to be a certain sign of its approach, which may be occasioned by the eruption of flame from a distant volcano in these extensive and impenetrable deserts of sand.

<L>And crown'd with fame your TORRICELL, and BOYLE;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Torricell and Boyle.</HI> l. 128. The pressure of the atmosphere was discovered by Torricelli, a disciple of Galileo, who had previously found that the air had weight. Dr. Hook and M. Du Hamel ascribe the invention of the air-pump to Mr Boyle, who however confesses he had some hints concerning its construction from De Guerick. The vacancy at the summit of the barometer is termed the Torricellian vacuum, and the exhausted receiver of an air pump the Boylean vacuum, in honour of these two philosophers.</P>
<P>The mist and descending dew which appear at first exhausting the receiver of an air-pump, are explained in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. from the cold produced by the expansion of air. For a thermometer placed in the receiver sinks some degrees, and in a very little time, as soon as a sufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the surrounding bodies, the dew becomes again taken up. See additional notes, No. VII. Mr. Saussure observed on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air-pump, that though on beginning to exhaust it the air became misty, and parted with its moisture, yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted, and the instrument pointed to greater dryness. This unexpected occurrence is explained by M. Monge (Annales de Chymie, Tom. V.) to depend on the want of the usual pressure of the atmosphere to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair; and M. Saussure supposes, that his vesicular vapour requires more time to be redissolved, than is necessary to dry the hair of his thermometer. Essais sur l'Hygrom. p. 226. but I suspect there is a less hypothetical way of understanding it; when a colder body is brought into warm and moist air, (as a bottle of spring-water for instance,) a steam is quickly collected on its surface; the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air, it continues free from dew so long as it continues warm; for it warms the atmosphere around it, and renders it capable of receiving instead of parting with moisture. The moment the air becomes rarefied in the receiver of the air-pump it becomes colder, as appears by the thermometer, and deposits its vapour; but the hair of Mr. Saussure's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immersed, and in consequence becomes dryer than before, by warming the air which immediately surrounds it, a part of its moisture evaporating along with its heat.</P></NOTE></L>

Denser bodies propagate vibration or sound better than rarer ones; if two stones be struck together under the water, they may be heard a mile or two by any one whose head is immersed at that distance, according to an experiment of Dr. Franklin. If the ear be applied to one end of a long beam of timber, the stroke of a pin at the other end becomes sensible; if a poker be suspended in the middle of a garter, each end of which is pressed against the ear, the least percussions on the poker give great sounds. And I am informed by laying the ear on the ground the tread of a horse may be discerned at a great distance in the night. The organs of hearing belonging to fish are for this reason much less complicated than of quadrupeds, as the fluid they are immersed in so much better conveys its vibrations. And it is probable that some shell-fish which have twisted shells like the cochlea and semicircular canals of the ears of men and quadrupeds may have no appropriated organ for perceiving the vibrations of the element they live in, but may by their spiral form be in a manner all ear.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Where oft your PRIESTLEY WOOS your airy powers,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Where oft your Priestley.</HI> l. 166. The same of Dr. Priestley is known in every part of the earth where science has penetrated. His various discoveries respecting the analysis of the atmosphere, and the production of variety of new airs or gasses, can only be clearly understood by reading his Experiments on Airs, (3 vols. octavo, Johnson, London.) the following are amongst his many discoveries. 1. The discovery of nitrous and dephlogisticated airs. 2. The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air. 3. Ascertaining the purity of respirable air by nitrous air. 4. The restoration of vitiated air by vegetation. 5. The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air. 6. The conversion by means of light of animal and vegetable substances, that would otherwise become putrid and offensive, into nourishment of vegetables. 7. The use of respiration by the blood parting with phlogiston, and imbibing dephlo∣gisticated air.</P>
<P>The experiments here alluded to are, 1. Concerning the production of nitrous gas from dissolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid, which though first discovered by Dr. Hales (Static. Ess. Vol. I. p. 224) was fully investigated, and applied to the important purpose of distinguishing the purity of atmospheric air by Dr. Priestley. When about two measures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed together a red effervescence takes place, and the two airs occupy about one fourth less space than was previously occupied by the common air alone.</P>
<P>2. Concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of reservoirs of water, which Dr. Priestley discovered to yield much pure air when the sun shone on it. His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green substance, which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus conferva, an inverted bell-glass previously filled with water, which subsides as the air arises; it has since been found that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves, when the sun shines upon them, but not in the night, which may be owing to the sleep of the plant.</P>
<P>3. The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals. The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination, insomuch that 100 pounds of lead will produce 112 pounds of minium; the ore of manganese, which is always found near the surface of the earth, is replete with pure air, which is now used for the purpose of bleaching. Other metals when exposed to the atmosphere attract the pure air from it, and become calces by its combination, as zinc, lead, iron; and increase in weight in proportion to the air, which they imbibe.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="166"/></L>

Bacon's Works, Vol. V. p. 470. edit. 4to. Lond. 1778. This allusion is still more curiously exact, from the late discovery of pure air being given up from vegetables, and that then in its unmixed state it more readily combines with metallic or inflammable bodies. From these fables which were probably taken from antient hieroglyphics there is frequently reason to believe that the Egyptians possessed much chemical knowledge, which for want of alphabetical writing perished with their philosophers.</P></NOTE></L>

Dr. Priestley's discovery of the production of pure air from such variety of substances will probably soon be applied to the improvement of the diving bell, as the substances which contain vital air in immense quantities are of little value as manganese and minium. See additional notes, No. XXXIII. In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air, now as sixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot, and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water, five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air or about six thousand gallons. Now, as this is at least thrice as pure as atmospheric air, a gallon of it may be supposed to serve for three minutes respiration for one man. At present the air can not be set at liberty from minium by viriolic acid without the application of some heat, this is however very likely soon to be discovered, and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted ships or diving balloons.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle relates, that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a vessel to be rowed under water, but also a liquor to be caried in that vessel, which would supply the want of fresh air. The vessel was made by order of James I. and carried twelve rowers besides passengers. It was tried in the river Thames, and one of the persons who was in that submarine voyage told the particulars of the experiments to a person who related them to Mr. Boyle.

See note on Ulva, Vol. II. of this work. See Annual Register for 1774. p. 245.</P>
<P>Mr. Spalding was professionally ingenious in the art of constructing and managing the diving bell, and had practised the business many years with success. He went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view the wreck of the Imperial East-Indiaman at the Kish bank in Ireland. On descending the third time in June, 1783, they remained about an hour under water, and had two barrels of air sent down to them, but on the signals from below not being again repeated, after a certain time, they were drawn up by their assistants and both found dead in the bell. Annual Register for 1783, p. 206. These two unhappy events may for a time check the ardor of adventurers in traversing the bottom of the ocean, but it is probable in another half century it may be safer to travel under the ocean than over it, since Dr. Priestley's discovery of procuring pure air in such great abundance from the calces of metals.</P></NOTE></L>

The pestilential winds of the east are described by various authors under various denominations; as harmattan, samiel, samium, syrocca, kamsin, seravansum. M. de Beauchamp describes a remarkable south wind in the deserts about Bagdad, called seravansum, or poison-wind; it burns the face, impedes respiration, strips the trees of their leaves, and is said to pass on in a streight line, and often kills, people in six hours. P. Cotte sur la Meteorol. Analytical Review for February, 1790. M. Volney says, the hot wind or ramsin seems to blow at the season when the sands of the deserts are the hottest; the air is then filled with an extreamly subtle dust. Vol. I. p. 61. These winds blow in all directions from the deserts; in Egypt the most violent proceed from the S. S. W. at Mecca from the E. at Surat from the N. at Bassora from the N. W. at Bagdad from the W. and in Syria from the S. E.</P>
<P>On the south of Syria, he adds, where the Jordan flows is a country of volcanos; and it is observed that the earthquakes in Syria happen after their rainy season, which is also conformable to a similar observation made by Dr. Shaw in Barbary. Travels in Egypt, Vol. I. p. 303.</P>
<P>These winds seem all to be of volcanic origin, as before mentioned, with this dif∣ference, that the Simoom is attended with a stream of electric matter; they seem to be in consequence of earthquakes caused by the monsoon floods, which fall on volcanic fires in Syria, at the same time that they inundate the Nile.</P></NOTE></L>

If this could be accomplished, it would be the most happy discovery that ever has hap∣pened to these northern latitudes, since in this country the N. E. winds bring frost, and the S. W. ones are attended with warmth and moisture; if the inferior currents of air could be kept perpetually from the S. W. supplied by new productions of air at the line, or by superior currents flowing in a contrary direction, the vegetation of this country would be doubled; as in the moist vallies of Africa, which know no frost; the number of its inhabitants would be increased, and their lives prolonged; as great abundance of the aged and infirm of mankind, as well as many birds and animals, are destroyed by severe continued frosts in this climate.</NOTE></L>

<P>The lobes are reservoirs of prepared nutriment for the young seed, which is absorbed by its placental vessels, and converted into sugar, till it has penetrated with its roots far enough into the earth to extract sufficient moisture, and has acquired leaves to con∣vert it into nourishment. In some plants these lobes rise from the earth and supply the place of leaves, as in kidney-beans, cucumbers, and hence seem to serve both as a placenta to the foetus, and lungs to the young plant. During the process of germination the starch of the seed is converted into sugar, as is seen in the procese of malting barley for the purpose of brewing. And is on this account very similar to the digestion of food in the stomachs of animals, which converts all their aliment into a chyle, which consists of mucilage, oil, and sugar; the placentation of buds will be spoken of hereafter.</P></NOTE></L>

Mr. Whitmill advised to bind some of the most vigorous shoots with strong wire, and even some of the large roots; and Mr. Warner cuts, what he calls a wild worm about the body of the tree, or scores the bark quite to the wood like a screw with a sharp knife. Bradley on Gardening, Vol. II. p. 155. Mr. Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on wall trees by cutting off a part of the bark. Phil. Trans. Ann. 1761. M. Buffon produced the same effect by a straight bandage put round a branch, Act. Paris, Ann. 1738, and concludes that an ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by the callous.</P>
<P>A compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from the branch of a pear tree against a wall in Mr. Howard's garden at Lichfield about five years ago, the circumcised part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it, yet this branch has been full of fruit every year since, when the other branches of the tree bore only sparingly. I lately observed that the leaves of this wounded branch were smaller and paler, and the fruit less in size, and ripened sooner than on the other parts of the tree. Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much the same effect.</P>
<P>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed difficult, but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuallity of buds. A flower-bud dies, when it has perfected its seed, like an annual plant, and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to pass downwards; but on the contrary leaf-buds, as they advance into shoots, form new buds in the axilla of every leaf, which new buds require new roots to pass down the bark, and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch, now if a wire or string be tied round the bark, many of these new roots cannot descend, and thence more of the buds will be converted into flower-buds.</P></NOTE></L>

Mr. Hitt in his treatise on fruit trees observes that if a vigorous branch of a wall tree be bent to the horizon, or beneath it, it looses its vigour and becomes a bearing branch. The theory of this I suppose to depend on the difficulty with which the leaf-shoots can protrude the roots necessary for their new progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to their natural habits or powers, whence more flower-shoots are produced which do not require new roots to pass along the bark of the bended branch, but which let their offspring, the seeds, fall upon the earth and seek roots for themselves.</P></NOTE></L>

Mr. Fairchild budded a passion-tree, whose leaves were spotted with yellow, into one which bears long fruit. The buds did not take, nevertheless in a fortnight yellow spots began to shew themselves about three feet above the inocu∣lation, and in a short time afterwards yellow spots appeared on a shoot which came out of the ground from another part of the plant. Bradley, Vol. II. p. 129. These facts are the more curious since from experiments of ingrafting red currants on black (Ib. Vol. II.) the fruit does not acquire any change of flavour, and by many other experi∣ments neither colour nor any other change is produced in the fruit ingrafted on other stocks.</P>
<P>There is an apple described in Bradley's work which is said to have one side of it a sweet fruit which boils soft, and the other side a sour fruit which boils hard, which Mr. Bradley so long ago as the year 1721 ingeniously ascribes to the farina of one of these apples impregnating the other, which would seem the more probable if we consider that each division of an apple is a separate womb, and may therefore have a separate impreg∣nation like puppies of different kinds in one litter. The same is said to have occurred in oranges and lemons, and grapes of different colours.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Fair CYPREPEDIA with succesfful guile<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Fair Cyprepedia.</HI> l. 505. The cyprepedium from South America is supposed to be of larger size and brighter colours than that from North America from which this print is taken; it has a large globular nectary about the size of a pidgeon's egg of a fleshy colour, and an incision or depression on its upper part, much resembling the body of the large American spider; this globular nectary is attached to divergent slender petals not unlike the legs of the same animal. This spider is called by Linneus Arenea avicularia, with a convex orbicular thorax, the center transversely excavated, he adds that it catches small birds as well as insects, and has the venemous bite of a serpent. System Nature, Tom. I. p. 1034. M. Lonvilliers de Poincy, (Histoire Nat. des Antilles, Cap. xiv. art. III.) calls it Phalange, and describes the body to be the size of a pidgeon's egg, with a hollow on its back like a navel, and mentions its catching the humming-bird in its strong nets.</P>
<P>The similitude of this flower to this great spider seems to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent the humming-bird from plundering its honey. About Matlock in Derbyshire the fly-ophris is produced, the nectary of which so much resembles the small wall-bee, perhaps the apis ichneumonea, that it may be easily mistaken for it at a small distance. It is probable that by this means it may often escape being plundered. See note on lonicera in the next poem.</P>
<P>A bird of our own country called a willow-wren (Motacilla) runs up the stem of the crown-imperial (Frittillaria coronalis) and sips the pendulous drops within its petals. This species of Motacilla is called by Ray Regulus non cristatus. White's Hist. of Selborne.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="505"/></L>

<L>2 "Shield the young Harvest from devouring blight,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Shield the young harvest.</HI> l. 511. Linneus enumerates but four diseases of plants; Erysyche, the white mucor or mould, with sessile tawny heads, with which the leaves are sprinkled, as is frequent on the hop, humulus, maple, acer, &amp;c. Rubigo, the ferru∣gineous powder sprinkled under the leaves frequent in lady's mantle, alchemilla, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Clavus, when the seeds grow out into larger horns black without, as in rye. This is called Ergot by the french writers.</P>
<P>Ustulago, when the fruit instead of seed produces a black powder, as in barley, oats, &amp;c. To which perhaps the honey-dew ought to have been added, and the canker, in the former of which the nourishing fluid of the plant seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in the sweating sickness of the last century. The latter is a phagedenic ulcer of the bark, very destructive to young apple-trees, and which in cherry-trees is attended with a deposition of gum arabic, which often terminates in the death of the tree.</P></NOTE></L>

There is a disease frequently affects the rye in France, and sometimes in England in moist seasons, which is called Ergot, or horn seed; the grain becomes considerably elongated and is either straight or crooked, containing black meal along with the white, and appears to be pierced by insects, which were probably the cause of the disease. Mr. Duhamel ascribes it to this cause, and compares it to galls on oak-leaves.

<P>The irritability of plants is abundantly evinced by the absorption and pulmonary circulation of their juices; their sensibility is shewn by the approaches of the males to the females, and of the females to the males in numerous instances; and, as the essential circumstance of sleep consists in the temporary abolition of voluntary power alone, the sleep of plants evinces that they possess voluntary power; which also indisputably appears in many of them by closing their petals or their leaves during cold, or rain, or darkness, or from mechanic violence.</P></NOTE></L>

<HEAD>NOTE I.—METEORS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Etherial Forms! you chase the shooting stars,</L>
<L>Or yoke the vollied lightnings to your cars.</L>
<BIBL>CANTO I. 1. 115.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE seem to be three concentric strata of our incumbent atmosphere; in
which, or between them, are produced four kinds of meteors; lightning, shooting stars,
fire-balls, and northern lights. First, the lower region of air, or that which is dense enough
to resist by the adhesion of its particles the descent of condensed vapour, or clouds, which
may extend from one to three or four miles high. In this region the common lightning is
produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in those floating fields of vapour
either in respect to each other, or in respect to the earth beneath them, or the dissolved
vapour above them, which is constantly varying both with the change of the form of the
clouds, which thus evolve a greater or less surface; and also with their ever-changing
degree of condensation. As the lightning is thus produced in dense air, it proceeds but
a short course on account of the greater resistance which it encounters, is attended with
a loud explosion, and appears with a red light.</P>
<P>2. The second region of the atmosphere I suppose to be that which has too little
tenacity to support condensed vapour or clouds; but which yet contains invisible vapour,
or water in aerial solution. This aerial solution of water differs from that dissolved in the
matter of heat, as it is supported by its adhesion to the particles of air, and is not pre∣cipitated
by cold. In this stratum it seems probable that the meteors called shooting
stars are produced; and that they consist of electric sparks, or lightning, passing from
one region to another of these invisible fields of aero-aqueous solution. The height of
these shooting stars has not yet been ascertained by sufficient observation; Dr. Blagden
thinks their situation is lower down in the atmosphere than that of fireballs, which he
conjectures from their swift apparent motion, and ascribes their smallness to the more
minute division of the electric matter of which they are supposed to consist, owing to
<PB N="2" REF="231"/>
the geater resistance of the denser medium through which they pass, than that in which
the fire-balls exist. Mr. Brydone observed that the shooting stars appeared to him to be
as high in the atmosphere, when he was near the summit of mount Etna, as they do
when observed from the plain. Phil. Tran. Vol. LXIII.</P>
<P>As the stratum of air, in which shooting stars are supposed to exist is much rarer
than that in which lightning resides, and yet much denser than that in which fire∣balls
are produced, they will be attracted at a greater distance than the former, and
at a less than the latter. From this rarity of the air so small a sound will be pro∣duced
by their explosion, as not to reach the lower parts of the atmosphere; their
quantity of light from their greater distance being small, is never seen through dense
air at all, and thence does not appear red, like lightning or fire balls. There are
no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them, because the constituent parts of these
aero-aqueous regions may possess an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet
be in perfect reciprocal solution. And lastly their apparent train of light is probably owing
only to a continuance of their impression on the eye; as when a fire-stick is whirled in
the dark it gives the appearance of a compleat circle of fire: for these white trains of
shooting stars quickly vanish, and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their passage,
as seems to happen in the transit of fire-balls.</P>
<P>3. The second region or stratum of air terminates I suppose where the twilight ceases
to be refracted, that is, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth;
and where it seems probable that the common air ends, and is surrounded by an atmo∣sphere
of inflammable gas tenfold rarer than itself. In this region I believe fire-balls
sometimes to pass, and at other times the northern lights to exist. One of these fire-balls
or draco volans, was observed by Dr. Pringle and many others on Nov. 26, 1758, which
was afterwards estimated to have been a mile and a half in circumference, to have been
about one hundred miles high, and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of
near thirty miles in a second of time. This meteor had a real tail many miles long,
which threw off sparks in its course, and the whole exploded with a sound like distant
thunder. Philos. Trans. Vol. LI.</P>
<P>Dr. Blagden has related the history of another large meteor, or fire-ball, which was
seen the 18th of August, 1783, with many ingenious observations and conjectures.
This was estimated to be between 60 and 70 miles high, and to travel 1000 miles at the
rate of about twenty miles in a second. This fire-ball had likewise a real train of light
left behind it in its passage, which varied in colour; and in some part of its course gave
off sparks or explosions where it had been brightest; and a dusky red streak remained
visible perhaps a minute. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXIV.</P>
<P>These fire-balls differ from lightning, and from shooting stars in many remarkable
circumstances; as their very great bulk, being a mile and a half in diameter; their tra∣velling
1000 miles nearly horizontally; their throwing off sparks in their passage; and
changing colours from bright blue to dusky red; and leaving a train of fire behind them,
continuing about a minute. They differ from the northern lights in not being diffused,
but passing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line; and this in a
region above the crepuscular atmosphere, where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the
<PB N="3" REF="232"/>
surface of the earth. There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for
these appearances!—One I shall therefore hazard; which, if it does not inform, may
amuse the reader.</P>
<P>In the note on l. 123, it was shewn that there is probably a supernatant stratum of
inflammable gas or hydrogene, over the common atmosphere; and whose density at the
surface where they meet, must be at least ten times less than that upon which it swims;
like chemical ether floating upon water, and perhaps without any real contact. 1. In
this region, where the aerial atmosphere terminates and the inflammable one begins, the
quantity of tenacity or resistance must be almost inconceivable; in which a ball of elec∣tricity
might pass 1000 miles with greater ease than through a thousandth part of an
inch of glass. 2. Such a ball of electricity passing between inflammable and common air
would set fire to them in a line as it passed along; which would differ in colour accord∣ing
to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs; and from the same cause
there might occur greater degrees of inflammation, or branches of fire, in some parts of
its course.</P>
<P>As these fire-balls travel in a defined line, it is pretty evident from the known laws of
electricity, that they must be attracted; and as they are a mile or more in diameter, they
must be emitted from a large surface of electric matter; because large nobs give larger
sparks, less diffused, and more brightly luminous, than less ones or points, and resist
more forceably the emission of the electric matter. What is there in nature can attract
them at so great a distance as 1000 miles, and so forceably as to detach an electric spark
of a mile diameter? Can volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect, as they
are generally attended with lightning? Future observations must discover these secret
operations of nature! As a stream of common air is carried along with the passage of
electric aura from one body to another; it is easy to conceive, that the common air and
the inflammable air between which the fire-ball is supposed to pass, will be partially
intermixed by being thus agitated, and so far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire,
and produce the linear flame and branching sparks above described. In this circumstance
of their being attracted, and thence passing in a defined line, the fire-balls seem to differ
from the coruscations of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, which probably take
place in the same region of the atmosphere; where the common air exists in extreme
tenuity, and is covered by a still rarer sphere of inflammable gas, ten times lighter than
itself.</P>
<P>As the electric streams, which constitute these northern lights, seem to be repelled or
radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north, and not attracted like the fire∣balls;
this accounts for the diffusion of their light, as well as the silence of their passage;
while their variety of colours, and the permanency of them, and even the breadth of
them in different places, may depend on their setting on fire the mixture of inflammable
and common air through which they pass; as seems to happen in the transit of the
fire-balls.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="233"/>
It was observed by Dr. Priestley that the electric shock taken through inflammable air
was red, in common air it is blueish; to these circumstances perhaps some of the colours
of the northern lights may bear analogy; though the density of the medium through
which light is seen must principally vary its colour, as is well explained by Mr. Morgan.
Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXV. Hence lightning is red when seen through a dark cloud, or
near the horizon; because the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so dense a medium.
But the shooting stars consist of white light, as they are generally seen on clear nights,
and nearly vertical: in other situations their light is probably too faint to come to us.
But as in some remarkable appearances of the northern lights, as in March, 1716, all
the prismatic colours were seen quickly to succeed each other, these appear to have been
owing to real combustion; as the density of the interposed medium could not be supposed
to change so frequently; and therefore these colours must have been owing to different
degrees of heat according to Mr. Morgan's theory of combustion. In Smith's Optics,
p. 69. the prismatic colours, and optical deceptions of the northern lights are described
by Mr. Cotes.</P>
<P>The Torricellian vacuum, if perfectly free from air, is said by Mr. Morgan and
others to be a perfect non-conductor. This circumstance therefore would preclude the
electric streams from rising above the atmosphere. But as Mr. Morgan did not try to
pass an electric shock through a vacuum, and as air, or something containing air, sur∣rounding
the transit of electricity may be necessary to the production of light, the con∣clusion
may perhaps still be dubious. If however the streams of the northern lights were
supposed to rise above our atmosphere, they would only be visible at each extremity of
their course; where they emerge from, or are again immerged into the atmosphere; but
not in their journey through the vacuum; for the absence of electric light in a vacuum is
sufficiently proved by the common experiment of shaking a barometer in the dark; the
electricity, produced by the friction of the mercury in the glass at its top, is luminous if
the barometer has a little air in it; but there is no light if the vacuum be complete.</P>
<P>The aurora borealis, or northern dawn, is very ingeniously accounted for by Dr.
Franklin on principles of electricity. He premises the following electric phenomena:
1. that all new fallen snow has much positive electricity standing on its surface. 2. That
about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a crust of eternal ice,
which is impervious to the electric fluid. 3. That the dense part of the atmosphere rises
but a few miles high; and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will pass to almost
any distance.</P>
<P>Hence he supposes there must be a great accumulation of positive electric matter on the
fresh fallen snow in the polar regions; which, not being able to pass through the crust of
ice into the earth, must rise into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmosphere, which
will the least resist its passage; and passing towards the equator descend again into the
denser atmosphere, and thence into the earth in silent streams. And that many of the
appearances attending these lights are optical deceptions, owing to the situation of the
eye that beholds them; which makes all ascending parallel lines appear to converge to a
point.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="234"/>
The idea, above explained in note on l. 123, of the existence of a sphere of inflam∣mable
gas over the aerial atmosphere would much favour this theory of Dr. Franklin;
because in that case the dense aerial atmosphere would rise a much less height in the
polar regions, diminishing almost to nothing at the pole itself; and thus give an
easier passage to the ascent of the electric fluid. And from the great difference in
the specific gravity of the two airs, and the velocity of the earth's rotation, there
must be a place between the poles and the equator, where the superior atmosphere
of inflammable gas would terminate; which would account for these streams of the
aurora borealis not appearing near the equator; add to this that it is probable the electric
fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one; and will thence by the rotation of the
earth's surface ascend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force; and may thus be
induced to rise through the thin stratum of aerial atmosphere over the poles. See note
on Canto II. l. 193. I shall have occasion again to mention this great accumulation of
inflammable air over the poles; and to conjecture that these northern lights may be pro∣duced
by the union of inflammable with common air, without the assistance of the
electric spark to throw them into combustion.</P>
<P>The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted; as none were
recorded in our annals since the remarkable one on Nov. 14, 1574, till another remark∣able
one on March 6, 1716, and the three following nights, which were seen at the
same time in Ireland, Russia, and Poland, extending near 30 degrees of longitude and
from about the 50th degree of latitude over almost all the north of Europe. There is
however reason to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately described; thus
the following curious passage from the Book of Maccabees, (B. II. c. v.) is such a de∣scription
of them, as might probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people.
<Q>Through all the city, for the space of almost forty days, there were seen horsemen run∣ning
in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers; and
troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another, with shak∣ing
of shields and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and
glittering of golden ornaments and harness.</Q></P>

<Q><L>Cling round the aerial bow with prisms bright,</L>
<L>And pleased untwist the sevenfold threads of light.</L>
<BIBL>CANTO I. l. 117.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some measure understood
before Sir Isaac Newton had discovered his theory of colours. The first person who
expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sunbeams from drops
of falling rain was Antonio de Dominis. This was afterwards more fully and distinctly
explained by Des Cartes. But what caused the diversity of its colours was not then un∣derstood;
it was reserved for the immortal Newton to discover that the rays of light con∣sisted
of seven combined colours of different refrangibility, which could be seperated at
pleasure by a wedge of glass. Pemberton's View of Newton.</P>
<P>Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the prismatic spectrum was composed of seven colours
in the following proportions, violet 80, indigo 40, blue 60, green 60, yellow 48, orange 27,
red 45. If all these colours be painted on a circular card in the proportions above men∣tioned,
and the card be rapidly whirled on its center, they produce in the eye the sensa∣tion
of white. And any one of these colours may be imitated by painting a card with
the two colours which are contiguous to it, in the same proportions as in the spectrum,
and whirling them in the same manner.</P>
<P>My ingenious friend, Mr. Galton of Birmingham, ascertained in this manner by a set
of experiments the following propositions; the truth of which he had preconceived from
the above data.</P>
<P>1. Any colour in the prismatic spectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two
colours contiguous to it.</P>
<P>2. If any three successive colours in the prismatic spectrum are mixed, they compose
only the second or middlemost colour.</P>
<P>3. If any four successive colours in the prismatic spectrum be mixed, a tint similar to
a mixture of the second and third colours will be produced, but not precisely the same,
because they are not in the same proportion.</P>
<P>4. If beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum, you take of the second
colour a quantity equal to the first, second, and third; and add to that the fifth colour,
equal in quantity to the fourth, fifth, and sixth; and with these combine the seventh
colour in the proportion it exists in the spectrum, white will be produced. Because the
first, second, and third, compose only the second; and the fourth, fifth, and sixth, com∣pose
only the fifth; therefore if the seventh be added, the same effect is produced, as if
all the seven were employed.</P>
<P>5. Beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum, if you take a tint composed of
a certain proportion of the second and third, (equal in quantity to the first, second, third,
and fourth,) and add to this the sixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth, sixth, and
seventh, white will be produced.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="236"/>
From these curious experiments of Mr. Galton many phenomena in the chemical
changes of colours may probably become better understood; especially if, as I suppose,
the same theory must apply to transmitted colours, as to reflected ones. Thus it is well
known, that if the glass of mangonese, which is a tint probably composed of violet and
indigo, be mixed in a certain proportion with the glass of lead, which is yellow; that the
mixture becomes transparent. Now from Mr. Galton's experiments it appears, that in
reflected colours such a mixture would produce white, that is, the same as if all the colours
were reflected. And therefore in transmitted colours the same circumstances must pro∣duce
transparency, that is, the same as if all the colours were transmitted. For the
particles, which constitute the glass of mangonese will transmit red, violet, indigo, and blue;
and those of the glass of lead will transmit orange, yellow, and green; hence all the
primary colours by a mixture of these glasses become transmitted, that is, the glass
becomes transparent.</P>
<P>Mr. Galton has further observed that five successive prismatic colours may be com∣bined
in such proportions as to produce but one colour, a circumstance which might be
of consequence in the art of painting. For if you begin at any part of the circular
spectrum above described, and take the first, second, and third colours in the proportions
in which they exist in the spectrum; these will compose only the second colour equal in
quantity to the first, second, and third; add to these the third, fourth, and fifth in the
proportion they exist in the spectrum, and these will produce the fourth colour equal in
quantity to the third, fourth, and fifth. Consequently this is precisely the same thing, as
mixing the second and fourth colours only; which mixture would only produce the third
colour. Therefore if you combine the first, second, fourth, and fifth in the proportions
in which they exist in the spectrum, with double the quantity of the third colour, this
third colour will be produced. It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in
mixing colours on a painter's easle, as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures, may
depend on these principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their
minute particles.</P>
<P>Mr. Galton further observes, that white may universally be produced by the com∣bination
of one prismatic colour, and a tint intermediate to two others. Which tint may
be distinguished by a name compounded of the two colours, to which it is intermediate.
Thus white is produced by a mixture of red with blue-green. Of orange with indigo∣blue.
Of Yellow with violet-indigo. Of green with red-violet. Of blue with Orange-red.
Of indigo with yellow-orange. Of violet with green-yellow. Which he further remarks
exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrews∣bury
in his account of ocular spectra; who has shewn that when one of these contrasted
colours has been long viewed, a spectrum or appearance of the other becomes visible in
the fatigued eye. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVI. for the year 1786.</P>
<P>These experiments of Mr. Galton might much assist the copper-plate printers of
callicoes and papers in colours; as three colours or more might be produced by two
copper-plates. Thus suppose some yellow figures were put on by the first plate, and
upon some parts of these yellow figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid
on by another copper-plate. The three colours of yellow, blue, and green might be
produced; as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers.</P>

<P>THE rays from the rising and setting sun are refracted by our spherical atmosphere,
hence the most refrangible rays, as the violet, indigo, and blue are reflected in greater
quantities from the morning and evening skies; and the least refrangible ones, as red
and orange, are last seen about the setting sun. Hence Mr. Beguelin observed that the
shadow of his finger on his pocket-book was much bluer in the morning and evening,
when the shadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected.
Mr. Melville observes, that the blue rays being more refrangible are bent down in the
evenings by our atmosphere, while the red and orange being less refrangible continue to
pass on and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours. See Priestley's
History of Light and Colours, p. 440. But as the particles of air, like those of water,
are themselves blue, a blue shadow may be seen at all times of the day, though much
more beautifully in the mornings and evenings, or by means of a candle in the middle
of the day. For if a shadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger
between the paper and a candle in the day light, the shadow will appear very blue; the
yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue
by its contrast; these colours being opposite to each other, as explained in note II.</P>
<P>Colours are produced from clouds or mists by refraction, as well as by reflection.
In riding in the night over an unequal country I observed a very beautiful coloured
halo round the moon, whenever I was covered with a few feet of mist, as I ascended
from the vallies; which ceased to appear when I rose above the mist. This I suppose
was owing to the thinness of the stratum of mist, in which I was immersed; had it been
thicker, the colours refracted by the small drops, of which a fog consists, would not
have passed through it down to my eye.</P>
<P>There is a bright spot seen on the cornea of the eye, when we face a window, which
is much attended to by portrait painters; this is the light reflected from the spherical
surface of the polished cornea, and brought to a focus; if the observer is placed in this
focus, he sees the image of the window; if he is placed before or behind the focus, he
only sees a luminous spot, which is more luminous and of less extent, the nearer he
approaches to the focus. The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the dusky
corners of a room, or in holes in the earth, may arise in some instances from the same
principle; viz. the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea; which will be coloured
red or blue in some degree by the morning, evening, or meridian light; or by the objects
from which that light is previously reflected. In the cavern at Colebrook Dale, where
the mineral tar exsudes, the eyes of the horse, which was drawing a cart from within
<PB N="9" REF="238"/>
towards the mouth of it, appeared like two balls of phosphorus, when he was above 100
yards off, and for a long time before any other part of the animal was visible. In this
case I suspect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light, which had entered
the eye, being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humour, and thence emerg∣ing
again in parallel rays from the animals eye, as it does from the back surface of the
drops of the rainbow, and from the water-drops which lie, perhaps without contact, on
cabbage leaves, and have the brilliancy of quicksilver. This accounts for this luminous
appearance being best seen in those animals which have large apertures in their iris, as in
cats and horses, and is the only part visible in obscure places, because this is a better re∣flecting
surface than any other part of the animal. If any of these emergent rays from the
animals eye can be supposed to have been reflected from the choroid coat through the
semi-transparent retina, this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or
cats and rabits in dark corners.</P>

<BIBL>CANTO I. l. 134.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE have been many theories invented to account for the tails of comets. Sir
Isaac Newton thinks that they consist of rare vapours raised from the nucleus of the comet,
and so rarefied by the sun's heat as to have their general gravitation diminished, and that
they in consequence ascend opposite to the sun, and from thence reflect the rays of light.
Dr. Halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the streams of the aurora berealis,
and other electric effluvia. Philos. Trans. No. 347.</P>
<P>Dr. Hamilton observes that the light of small stars are seen undiminished through
both the light of the tails of comets, and of the aurora borealis, and has further illustrated
their electric analogy, and adds that the tails of comets consist of a lucid self-shining sub∣stance
which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light. Essays.</P>
<P>The tail of the comet of 1744 at one time appeared to extend above 16 degrees from
its body, and must have thence been above twenty three millions of miles long. And
the comet of 1680, according to the calculations of Dr. Halley on November the 11th,
was not above one semi-diameter of the earth, or less than 4000 miles to the northward
of the way of the earth; at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit, what
might have been the consequence! no one would probably have survived to have
registered the tremendous effects.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="239"/>
The comet of 1531, 1607, and 1682 having returned in the year 1759, according to
Dr. Halley's prediction in the Philos. Trans. for 1705, there seems no reason to doubt
that all the other comets will return after their proper periods. Astronomers have in
general acquiesced in the conjecture of Dr. Halley, that the comets of 1532, and 1661
are one and the same comet, from the similarity of the elements of their orbits, and were
therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium 1789. As this comet is liable to
be disturbed in its ascent from the sun by the planets Jupiter and Saturn, Dr. Maskelyne
expected its return to its perihelium in the beginning of the year 1789, or the latter end
of the year 1788, and certainly sometime before the 27th of April, 1789, which pre∣diction
has not been fulfilled. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXVI.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE V.—SUN'S RAYS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Or give the sun's phlogistic orb to roll. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 136.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE dispute among philosophers about phlogiston is not concerning the existence of
an inflammable principle, but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles.
The disciples of Stahl, which till lately included the whole chemical world, believed in
the identity of phlogiston in all bodies which would flame or calcine. The disciples of
Lavoisier pay homage to a plurality of phlogistons under the various names of charcoal,
sulphur, metals, &amp;c. Whatever will unite with <HI>pure</HI> air, and thence compose an acid, is
esteemed in this ingenious theory to be a different kind of phlogistic or inflammable body.
At the same time there remains a doubt whether these inflammable bodies, as metals,
sulphur, charcoal, &amp;c. may not be compounded of the same phlogiston along with some
other material yet undiscovered, and thus an unity of phlogiston exist, as in the theory of
Stahl, though very differently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena.</P>
<P>Some modern philosophers are of opinion that the sun is the great fountain from
which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogiston which they posses; and that
this is formed by the combination of the solar rays with all opake bodies, but particularly
with the leaves of vegetables, which they suppose to be organs adapted to absorb them.
And that as animals receive their nourishment from vegetables they also obtain in a
secondary manner their phlogiston from the sun. And lastly as great masses of the mineral
kingdom, which have been found in the thin crust of the earth which human labour has
penetrated, have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable
bodies, these also are supposed thus to have derived their phlogiston from the sun.</P>
<P>Another opinion concerning the sun's rays is, that they are not luminous till they
arrive at our atmosphere; and that there uniting with some part of the air they produce
<PB N="11" REF="240"/>
combustion, and light is emitted, and that an etherial acid, yet undiscovered, is formed
from this combustion.</P>
<P>The more probable opinion is perhaps, that the sun is a phlogistic mass of matter,
whose surface is in a state of combustion, which like other burning bodies emits light
with immense velocity in all directions; that these rays of light act upon all opake
bodies, and combining with them either displace or produce their elementary heat, and
become chemically combined with the phlogistic part of them; for light is given out
when phlogistic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air, as in combustion,
or in the reduction of metallic calxes; thus in presenting to the flame of a candle a letter∣wafer,
(if it be coloured with red-lead,) at the time the red-lead becomes a metallic drop,
a flash of light is perceived. Dr. Alexander Wilson very ingeniously endeavours to prove
that the sun is only in a state of combustion on its surface, and that the dark spots seen on
the disk are excavations or caverns through the luminous crust, some of which are 4000
miles in diameter. Phil. Trans. 1774. Of this I shall have occasion to speak again.</P>

<Q><L>Round her still centre tread the burning soil,</L>
<L>And watch the billowy Lavas, as they boil.</L><BIBL> CANTO I. 1. 139.</BIBL></Q>
<P>M. DE MAIRAN in a paper published in the Histoire de l'Academic de Sciences,
1765, has endeavoured to shew that the earth receives but a small part of the heat which
it possesses, from the sun's rays, but is principally heated by fires within itself. He thinks
the sun is the cause of the vicissitudes of our seasons of summer and winter by a very
small quantity of heat in addition to that already residing in the earth, which by emana∣tions
from the centre to the circumference renders the surface habitable, and without
which, though the sun was constantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once,
with a heat equal to that at the equator, it would soon become a mass of solid ice. His
reasonings and calculations on this subject are too long and too intricate to be in∣serted
here, but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much conviction along with
them.</P>
<P>The opinion that the center of the earth consists of a large mass of burning lava, has
been espoused by Boyle, Boerhave, and many other philosophers. Some of whom con∣sidering
its supposed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a
second sun. There are many arguments in support of this opinion. 1. Because the
power of the sun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth, all below
being in winter and summer always of the same degree of heat, viz. 48, which being
<PB N="12" REF="241"/>
much warmer than the mildest frost, is supposed to be sustained by some internal distant
fire. Add to this however that from experiments made some years ago by Dr. Franklin
the spring-water at Philadelphia appeared to be of 52° of heat, which seems further to
confirm this opinion, since the climates in North America are supposed to be colder
than those of Europe under similar degrees of latitude. 2. Mr. De Luc in going 1359
feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz on July the 5th, 1778, on a very fine day found
the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the shaft. Phil. Trans. Vol.
LXIX. p. 488. In the mines in Hungary, which are 500 cubits deep, the heat becomes
very troublesome when the miners get below 480 feet depth. <HI>Morinus de Locis subter.</HI>
p. 131. But as some other deep mines as mentioned by Mr. Kirwan are said to possess but
the common heat of the earth; and as the crust of the globe thus penetrated by human
labour is so thin compared with the whole, no certain deduction can be made from these
facts on either side of the question. 3. The warm-springs in many parts of the earth at
great distance from any Volcanos seem to originate from the condensation of vapours
arising from water which is boiled by subterraneous fires, and cooled again in their pas∣sage
through a certain length of the colder soil; for the theory of chemical solution will
not explain the equality of their heat at all seasons and through so many centuries. See
note on Fucus in Vol. II. See a letter on this subject in Mr. Pilkinton's View of Derby∣shire
from Dr. Darwin. 4. From the situations of volcanos which are always found
upon the summit of the highest mountains. For as these mountains have been lifted up
and lose several of their uppermost strata as they rise, the lowest strata of the earth yet
known appear at the tops of the highest hills; and the beds of the Volcanos upon these
hills must in consequence belong to the lowest strata of the earth, consisting perhaps of
granite or basaltes, which were produced before the existance of animal or vegetable
bodies, and might constitute the original nucleus of the earth, which I have supposed
to have been projected from the sun, hence the volcanos themselves appear to be spira∣cula
or chimneys belonging to great central fires. It is probably owing to the escape of
the elastic vapours from these spiracula that the modern earthquakes are of such small ex∣tent
compared with those of remote antiquity, of which the vestiges remain all over the
globe. 5. The great size and height of the continents, and the great size and depth of
the South-sea, Atlantic, and other oceans, evince that the first earthquakes, which pro∣duced
these immense changes in the globe, must have been occasioned by central fires.
6. The very distant and expeditious communication of the shocks of some great earth∣quakes.
The earthquake at Lisbon in 1755 was perceived in Scotland, in the Peak of
Derbyshire, and in many other distant parts of Europe. The percussions of it travelled
with about the velocity of sound, viz. about thirteen miles in a minute. The earthquake
in 1693 extended 2600 leagues. (Goldsmith's History.) These phenomena are easily ex∣plained
if the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid lava, as a percussion on one part
of such a fluid mass would be felt on other parts of its confining vault, like a stroke on a
fluid contained in a bladder, which however gentle on one side is perceptible to the hand
placed on the other; and the velocity with which such a concussion would travel would
be that of sound, or thirteen miles in a minute. For further information on this part of
the subject the reader is referred to Mr. Michell's excellent Treatise on Earthquakes in the
<PB N="13" REF="242"/>
Philos. Trans. Vol. LI. 7. That there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made pro∣bable
by the late experiments on the attraction of mountains by Mr. Maskerlyne, who sup∣posed
from other considerations that the density of the earth near the surface should be
five times less than its mean density. Phil. Trans. Vol. LXV. p. 498. But found from
the attraction of the mountain Schehallien, that it is probable, the mean density of the
earth is but double that of the hill. Ibid. p. 532. Hence if the first supposition be well
founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of considerable magnitude, from
whence the immense beds and mountains of lava, toadstone, basaltes, granite, &amp;c. have
been protruded. 8. The variation of the compass can only be accounted for by sup∣posing
the central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid mass, and that part of this fluid
is iron, which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fusion than glass or other
metals, remains a solid, and the vis inertiae of this fluid mass with the iron in it, occasions
it to perform sewer revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it, and thus it is gradu∣ally
left behind, and the place where the floating iron resides is pointed to by the direct
or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle. This seems to have been nearly the
opinion of Dr. Halley and Mr. Euler.</P>

<Q><L>Or sphere on sphere in widening waves expand,</L>
<L>And glad with genial warmth the incumbent land. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 143.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A CERTAIN quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides the
sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongst them. This combined
heat or latent heat of Dr. Black, when set at liberty by fermentation, inflammation,
crystallization, freezing, or other chemical attractions producing new <HI>combinations,</HI> passes
as a fluid element into the surrounding bodies. And by thawing, diffusion of neutral
salts in water, melting, and other chemical solutions, a portion of heat is attracted from
the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions.</P>
<P>Hence a combination of metals with acids, of essential oils and acids, of alcohol and
water, of acids and water, give out heat; whilst a <HI>solution</HI> of snow in water or in acids,
and of neutral salts in water, attract heat from the surrounding bodies. So the acid of
nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a most violent flame; the same
acid of nitre poured on snow instantly dissolves it and produces the greatest degree of cold
yet known, by which at Petersburgh quicksilver was first frozen in 1760.</P>
<P>Water may be cooled below 32° without being frozen, if it be placed on a solid floor
and secured from agitation, but when thus cooled below the freezing point the least
<PB N="14" REF="243"/>
agitation turns part of it suddenly into ice, and when this sudden freezing takes place a
thermometer placed in it instantly rises as some heat is given out in the act of congelation,
and the ice is thus left with the same <HI>sensible</HI> degree of cold as the water had possessed
before it was agitated, but is nevertheless now combined with less <HI>latent</HI> heat.</P>
<P>A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32° mixed with an equal quantity of boil∣ing
water at 212° will cool it to the middle number between these two, or to 122. But
a cubit inch of ice whose sensible cold also is but 32, mixed with an equal quantity of
boiling water, will cool it six times as much as the cubic inch of cold water above∣mentioned,
as the ice not only gains its share of the sensible or gravitating heat of the
boiling water but attracts to itself also and combines with the quantity of latent heat
which it had lost at the time of its congelation.</P>
<P>So boiling water will acquire but 212° of heat under the common pressure of the at∣mosphere,
but the steam raised from it by its expansion or by its solution in the atmo∣sphere
combines with and carries away a prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts
with on its condensation; as is seen in common distillation where the large quantity of
water in the worm-tub is so soon heated. Hence the evaporation of ether on a ther∣mometer
soon sinks the mercury below freezing, and hence a warmth of the air in winter
frequently succeeds a shower.</P>
<P>When the matter of heat or calorique is set at liberty from its combinations, as by
inflammation, it passes into the surrounding bodies, which possess different capacities of
acquiring their share of the loose or sensible heat; thus a pint measure of cold water at 48°
mixed with a pint of boiling water at 212° will cool it to the degree between these two
numbers, or to 154°, but it requires two pint measures of quicksilver at 48° of heat to
cool one pint of water as above. These and other curious experiments are adduced by
Dr. Black to evince the existance of combined or latent heat in bodies, as has been ex∣plained
by some of his pupils, and well illustrated by Dr. Crawford. The world has
long been in expectation of an account of his discoveries on this subject by the celebrated
author himself.</P>
<P>As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined state is not yet univer∣sally
received, I shall here add two arguments in support of it drawn from different sources,
viz. from the heat given out or absorbed by the mechanical condensation or expansion of
the air, and perhaps of other bodies, and from the analogy of the various phenomena of
heat with those of electricity.</P>
<P>I. If a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an air-pump, and the air hastily ex∣hausted,
the thermometer will sink some degrees, and the glass become steamy; the
same occurs in hastily admitting a part of the air again. This I suppose to be produced
by the expansion of part of the air, both during the exhaustion and re-admission of it;
and that the air so expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity
a part of their heat, hence the vapours contained in it and the glass receiver are for a
time colder and the steam is precipitated. That the air thus parts with its moisture from
the cold occasioned by its rarefaction and not simply by the rarefaction itself is evident,
because in a minute or two the same rarefied air will again take up the dew deposited on
the receiver; and because water will evaporate sooner in rare than in dense air.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="244"/>
There is a curious phenomenon similar to this observed in the fountain of Hiero con∣structed
on a large scale at the Chemnicensian mines in Hungary. In this machine the air
in a large vessel is compressed by a column of water 260 feet high, a stop-cock is then
opened, and as the air issues out with great vehemence, and thus becomes immediately
greatly expanded, so much cold is produced that the moisture from this stream of air is
precipitated in the form of snow, and ice is formed adhering to the nosel of the cock.
This remarkable circumstance is described at large with a plate of the machine in Philos.
Trans. Vol. LII. for 1761.</P>
<P>The following experiment is related by Dr. Darwin in the Philos. Trans. Vol.
LXXVIII. Having charged an air-gun as forcibly as he well could the air-cell and syringe
became exceedingly hot, much more so than could be ascribed to the friction in working
it; it was then left about half an hour to cool down to the temperature of the air, and a
thermometer having been previously fixed against a wall, the air was discharged in a con∣tinual
stream on its bulb, and it sunk many degrees. From these three experiments
of the steam in the exhaustéd receiver being deposited and re-absorbed, when a part of the
air is exhausted or re-admitted, and the snow produced by the fountain of Hiero, and
the extraordinary heat given out in charging, and the cold produced in discharging an
air-gun, there is reason to conclude that when air is mechanically compressed the
elementary fluid heat is pressed out of it, and that when it is mechanically expanded the
same fluid heat is re-absorbed from the common mass.</P>
<P>It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neighbours when
they are mechanically expanded, and give it out when they are mechanically condensed.
Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by per∣cussion,
these particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally; at
the times of their recession from each other, the body becomes enlarged in bulk, and is
then in a condition to attract heat from those in its vicinity with great and sudden power;
at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out, but the bodies
in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus lost, from other
bodies behind them, do not so suddenly or so forcibly re-absorb the heat again from the
body in vibration; hence it remains on its surface like the electric fluid on a rubbed glass
globe, and for the same reason, because there is no good conductor to take it up again.
Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired and stands loose upon the sur∣face;
as in filing metals or rubbing glass tubes; and thus a smith with a few strokes on
a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a brimstone-match; and hence in
striking flint and steel together heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus strucken
off, the quantity of which heat is again probably increased by the new chemical com∣bination.</P>
<P>II. The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat furnishes
another argument in support of the existence of heat as a gravitating fluid. 1. They are
both accumulated by friction on the excited body. 2. They are propagated easily or
with difficalty along the same classes of bodies; with ease by metals, with less ease by
water; and with difficulty by resins, bees-wax, silk, air, and glass. Thus glass canes
or canes of sealing-wax may be melted by a blow-pipe or a candle within a quarter of an
<PB N="16" REF="245"/>
inch of the fingers which hold them, without any inconvenient heat, while a pin or
other metallic substance applyed to the flame of a candle so readily conducts the heat as
immediately to burn the fingers. Hence clothes of silk keep the body warmer than clothes
of linen of equal thickness, by confining the heat upon the body. And hence plains are
so much warmer than the summits of mountains by the greater density of the air con∣fining
the acquired heat upon them. 3. They both give out light in their passage
through air, perhaps not in their passage through a vacuum. 4. They both of them
fuse or vitrify metals. 5. Bodies after being electrized if they are mechanically ex∣tended
will receive a greater quantity of electricity, as in Dr. Franklin's experiment of
the chain in the tankard; the same seems true in respect to heat as explained above.
6. Both heat and electricity contribute to suspend steam in the atmosphere by producing
or increasing the repulsion of its particles. 7. They both gravitate, when they have
been accumulated, till they find their equilibrium.</P>
<P>If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an easy and ele∣gant
explanation from the supposed matter of heat, as employed in the works of Bergman
and Lavoisier, I think we may reasonably allow of its existence as an element, occasionally
combined with other bodies, and occasionally existing as a fluid, like the electric fluid
gravitating amongst them, and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires
of the earth to the whole mass, and contribute to preserve the mean heat of the earth,
which in this country is about 48 degrees but variable from the greater or less effect of
the sun's heat in different climates, so well explained in Mr. Kirwan's Treatise on the
Temperature of different Latitudes. 1787, Elmsly. London.</P>

<P>THE gigantic statue of Memnon in his temple at Thebes had a lyre in his hands, which
many credible writers assure us, sounded when the rising sun shone upon it. Some philo∣sophers
have supposed that the sun's light possesses a mechanical impulse, and that the sounds
abovementioned might be thence produced. Mr. Michell constructed a very tender hori∣zontal
balance, as related by Dr. Priestley in his history of light and colours, for this pur∣pose,
but some experiments with this balance which I saw made by the late Dr. Powel,
who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity of it, were not conclusive
eitherway, as the copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded
in another.</P>
<P>There are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be
produced by very moderate degrees of heat. If a straight glass tube, such as are used for
barometers, be suspended horizontally before a fire, like a roasting spit, it will revolve by
intervals; for as glass is a bad conductor of heat the side next the fire becomes heated
sooner than the opposite side, and the tube becomes bent into a bow with the external
part of the curve towards the fire, this curve then falls down and produces a fourth part
of a revolution of the glass tube, which thus revolves with intermediate pauses.</P>
<P>Another alternating motion I have seen produced by suspending a glass tube about eight
inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a scale beam. This curious machine
is filled about one third part with purest spirit of wine, the other two thirds being a
vacuum, and is called a pulse-glass, if it be placed in a box before the fire, so that either
bulb, as it rises, may become shaded from the fire, and exposed to it when it descends, an
alternate libration of it is produced. For spirit of wine in vacuo emits steam by a very
small degree of heat, and this steam forces the spirit beneath it up into the upper bulb,
which therefore descends. It is probable such a machine on a larger scale might be of
use to open the doors or windows of hot-houses or mellon-frames, when the air within
them should become too much heated, or might be employed in more important me∣chanical
purposes.</P>
<P>On travelling through a hot summer's day in a chaise with a box covered with leather
on the fore-axle-tree, I observed, as the sun shone upon the black leather, the box began
to open its lid, which at noon rose above a foot, and could not without great force be
pressed down; and which gradually closed again as the sun declined in the evening. This
I suppose might with still greater facility be applied to the purpose of opening melon∣frames
or the sashes of hot-houses.</P>
<P>The statue of Memnon was overthrown and sawed in two by Cambyses to discover
its internal structure, and is said still to exist. See Savary's Letters on Egypt. The trun∣cated
statue is said for many centuries to have saluted the rising sun with chearful tones,
and the setting sun with melancholy ones.</P>

their shining in the night. They become much more lucid when they put themselves

The use of this light to the insect itself seems to be that it may not fly against
objects in the night; by which contrivance these insects are enabled to procure their
sustenance either by night or day, as their wants may require, or their numerous enemies
permit them; whereas some of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night, and if
they happen to come abroad too soon in the evening are so dazzled that they fly against
every thing in their way. See note on Phosphorus, No. X.</P>
<P>In some seas, as particularly about the coast of Malabar, as a ship floats along, it seems
during the night to be surrounded with fire, and to leave a long tract of light behind it.
Whenever the sea is gently agitated it seems converted into little stars, every drop as it
breaks emits light, like bodies electrified in the dark. Mr. Bomare says, that when he
was at the port of Cettes in Languedoc, and bathing with a companion in the sea after
a very hot day, they both appeared covered with fire after every immersion, and that
laying his wet hand on the arm of his companion, who had not then dipped himself, the
exact mark of his hand and fingers was seen in characters of fire. As numerous micro∣scopic
insects are found in this shining water, its light has been generally ascribed to
them, though it seems probable that fish-slime in hot countries may become in such a
state of incipient putrefaction as to give light, especially when by agitation it is more ex∣posed
to the air; otherwise it is not easy to explain why agitation should be necessary to
produce this marine light. See note on Phosphorus No. X.</P>

<Q><L>Or mark in shining letters Kunckel's name</L>
<L>In the pale phosphor's self-consuming flame. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 237.</BIBL></Q>
<P>KUNCKEL, a native of Hamburgh, was the first who discovered to the world
the process for producing phosphorus; though Brandt and Boyle were likewise said to
have previously had the art of making it. It was obtained from sal microcosmicum by
evaporation in the form of an acid, but has since been found in other animal substances,
as in the ashes of bones, and even in some vegetables, as in wheat flour. Keir's chemical
Dict. This phosphoric acid is like all other acids united with vital air, and requires
to be treated with charcoal or phlogiston to deprive it of this air, it then becomes a kind
of animal sulphur, but of so inflammable a nature, that on the access of air it takes fire
spontaneously, and as it burns becomes again united with vital air, and re-assumes its
form of phosphoric acid.</P>
<P>As animal respiration seems to be a kind of slow combustion, in which it is probable
that pbosphoric acid is produced by the union of phosphorus with the vital air, so it is
also probable that phosphoric acid is produced in the excretory or respiratory vessels of
luminous insects, as the glow-worm and fire-fly, and some marine insects. From the
same principle I suppose the light from putrid fish, as from the heads of hadocks, and
from putrid veal, and from rotten wood in a certain state of their putrefaction, is pro∣duced,
and phosphorus thus slowly combined with air is changed into phosphoric acid.
The light from the Bolognian stone, and from calcined shells, and from white paper,
and linen after having been exposed for a time to the sun's light, seem to produce either
the phosphoric or some other kind of acid from the sulphurous or phlogistic matter
which they contain. See note on Beccari's shells. l. 180.</P>
<P>There is another process seems similar to this slow combustion, and that is <HI>bleaching.</HI> By the warmth and light of the sun the water sprinkled upon linen or cotton cloth seems
to be decomposed, (if we credit the theory of M. Lavoisier,) and a part of the vital air
thus set at liberty and uncombined and not being in its elastic form, more easily dissolves
the colouring or phlogistic matter of the cloth, and produces a new acid, which is itself
colourless, or is washed out of the cloth by water. The new process of bleaching con∣firms
a part of this theory, for by uniting much vital air to marine acid by distilling it
from manganese, on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with this super∣aerated
marine acid, the colouring matter disappears immediately, sooner indeed in cotton
than in linen. See note XXXIV.</P>
<P>There is another process which I suspect bears analogy to these above-mentioned,
and that is the rancidity of animal fat, as of bacon; if bacon be hung up in a warm
kitchen, with much salt adhering on the outside of it, the fat part of it soon becomes
<PB N="20" REF="249"/>
yellow and rancid; if it be washed with much cold water after it has imbibed the salt,
and just before it is hung up, I am well informed, that it will not become rancid, or in
very slight degrees. In the former case I imagine the salt on the surface of the bacon
attracts water during the cold of the night, which is evaporated during the day, and
that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decomposed, as in bleaching, and its
vital air uniting with greater facility in its unelastic state with the animal fat, produces
an acid, perhaps of the phosphoric kind, which being of a fixed nature lies upon the
bacon, giving it the yellow colour and rancid taste. It is remarkable that the super∣aerated
marine acid does not bleach living animal substances, at least it did not whiten a
part of my hand which I for some minutes exposed to it.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XI.—STEAM-ENGINE.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Quick moves the balanced beam, of giant-birth,</L>
<L>Wields his large limbs, and nodding shakes the earth. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 267.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE expansive force of steam was known in some degree to the antients, Hero of
Alexandria describes an application of it to produce a rotative motion by the re-action of
steam issuing from a sphere mounted upon an axis, through two small tubes bent into
tangents, and issuing from the opposite sides of the equatorial diameter of the sphere,
the sphere was supplied with steam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water,
and entering the sphere at one of its poles.</P>
<P>A french writer about the year 1630 describes a method of raising water to the upper
part of a house by filling a chamber with steam, and suffering it to condense of itself, but
it seems to have been mere theory, as his method was scarcely practicable as he describes
it. In 1655 the Marquis of Worcester mentions a method of raising water by fire in his
Century of Inventions, but he seems only to have availed himself of the expansive force
and not to have known the advantages arising from condensing the steam by an injection
of cold water. This latter and most important improvement seems to have been made
by Capt. Savery sometime prior to 1698, for in that year his patent for the use of that
invention was confirmed by act of parliament. This gentleman appears to have been the
first who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an useful form. This
method consisted only in expelling the air from a vessel by steam and condensing the
steam by an injection of cold water, which making a vacuum, the pressure of the atmo∣sphere
forced the water to ascend into the steam-vessel through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet
<PB N="21" REF="250"/>
high, and by the admission of dense steam from the boiler, forcing the water in the steam∣vessel
to ascend to the height desired. This construction was defective because it required
very strong vessels to resist the force of the steam, and because an enormous quantity of
steam was condensed by coming in contact with the cold water in the steam-vessel.</P>
<P>About or soon after that time M. Papin attempted a steam-engine on similar principles
but rather more defective in its construction.</P>
<P>The next improvement was made very soon afterwards by Messrs. Newcomen and
Cawley of Dartmouth, it consisted in employing for the steam-vessel a hollow cylinder,
shut at bottom and open at top, furnished with a piston sliding easily up and down in it,
and made tight by oakum or hemp, and covered with water. This piston is suspended
by chains from one end of a beam, moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length,
to the other end of this beam are suspended the pump-rods.</P>
<P>The danger of bursting the vessels was avoided in this machine, as however high the
water was to be raised it was not necessary to increase the density of the steam but only
to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder.</P>
<P>Another advantage was, that the cylinder not being made so cold as in Savary's
method, much less steam was lost in filling it after each condensation.</P>
<P>The machine however still remained imperfect, for the cold water thrown into the
cylinder acquired heat from the steam it condensed, and being in a vessel exhausted of
air it produced steam itself, which in part resisted the action of the atmosphere on the
piston; were this remedied by throwing in more cold water the destruction of steam in
the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increased. It has therefore in
practice been found adviseable not to load these engines with columns of water weighing
more than seven pounds for each square inch of the area of the piston. The bulk of
water when converted into steam remained unknown until Mr. J. Watt, then of
Glasgow, in 1764, determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water. It soon
occurred to Mr. Watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no steam should be
condensed in filling the cylinder, and in which the steam should be so perfectly cooled as
to produce nearly a perfect vacuum.</P>
<P>Mr. Watt having ascertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo, and
under progressive degrees of pressure, and instructed by Dr. Black's discovery of latent
heat, having calculated the quantity of cold water necessary to condense certain quantities
of steam so far as to produce the exhaustion required, he made a communication from
the cylinder to a cold vessel previously exhausted of air and water, into which the steam
rushed by its elasticity, and became immediately condensed. He then adapted a cover to
the cylinder and admitted steam above the piston to press it down instead of air, and
instead of applying water he used oil or grease to fill the pores of the oakum and to lubri∣cate
the cylinder.</P>
<P>He next applied a pump to extract the injection water, the condensed steam, and the
air, from the condensing vessel, every stroke of the engine.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="251"/>
To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air, he sur∣rounded
it with a case containing steam, which he again protected by a covering of
matters which conduct heat slowly.</P>
<P>This construction presented an easy means of regulating the power of the engine, for
the steam being the acting power, as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more
or less opened, a greater or smaller quantity can enter during the time of a stroke, and
consequently the engine can act with exactly the necessary degree of energy.</P>
<P>Mr. Watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768, but the further persecution of his
designs were delayed by other avocations till 1775, when in conjunction with Mr. Boulton
of Soho near Birmingham, numerous experiments were made on a large scale by their
united ingenuity, and great improvements added to the machinery, and an act of parlia∣ment
obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twenty-five years, they have since
that time drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall, which but for the happy union
of such genius must immediately have ceased to work. One of these engines works a
pump of eighteen inches diameter, and upwards of 100 fathom or 600 feet high, at the
rate of ten to twelve strokes of seven feet long each, in a minute, and that with one fifth
part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do the same work. The
power of this engine may be easier comprehended by saying that it raised a weight equal
to 81000 pounds 80 feet high in a minute, which is equal to the combined action of 200
good horses. In Newcomen's engine this would have required a cylinder of the
enormous diameter of 120 inches or ten feet, but as in this engine of Mr. Watt and
Mr. Boulton the steam acts, and a vacuum is made, alternately above and below the
piston, the power exerted is double to what the same cylinder would otherways pro∣duce,
and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the
lever.</P>
<P>These gentlemen have also by other contrivances applied their engines to the turning
of mills for almost every purpose, of which that great pile of machinery the Albion
Mill is a well known instance. Forges, slitting mills, and other great works are erected
where nature has furnished no running water, and future times may boast that this
grand and useful engine was invented and perfected in our own country.</P>
<P>Since the above article went to the press the Albion Mill is no more; it is supposed
to have been set on fire by interested or malicious incendaries, and is burnt to the
ground. Whence London has lost the credit and the advantage of possessing the
most powerful machine in the world!</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XII.—FROST.</HEAD>
<Q><L>In phalanx firm the fiend of Frost assail. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 446.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE cause of the expansion of water during its conversion into ice is not yet well
ascertained, it was supposed to have been owing to the air being set at liberty in the act
of congelation which was before dissolved in the water, and the many air bubbles in ice
were thought to countenance this opinion. But the great force with which ice expands
during its congelation, so as to burst iron bombs and coehorns, according to the experi∣ments
of Major Williams at Quebec, invalidates this idea of the cause of it, and may
sometime be brought into use as a means of breaking rocks in mining, or projecting
cannon-balls, or for other mechanical purposes, if the means of producing congelation
should ever be discovered to be as easy as the means of producing combustion.</P>
<P>Mr. de Mairan attributes the increase of bulk of frozen water to the different arrange∣ment
of the particles of it in crystallization, as they are constantly joined at an angle of
60 degrees; and must by this disposition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they
were parallel. He found the augmentation of the water during freezing to amount to
one-fourteenth, one-eighteenth, one-nineteenth, and when the water was previously
purged of air to only one-twenty-second part. He adds that a piece of ice, which was
at first only one-fourteenth part specifically lighter than water, on being exposed some
days to the frost became one-twelfth lighter than water. Hence he thinks ice by being
exposed to greater cold still increases in volume, and to this attributes the bursting of ice
in ponds and on the glaciers. See Lewis's Commerce of Arts, p. 257. and the note on
Muschus in the other volume of this work.</P>
<P>This expansion of ice well accounts for the greater mischief done by vernal frosts at∣tended
with moisture, (as by hoar-frosts,) than by the dry frosts called black frosts. Mr.
Lawrence in a letter to Mr. Bradley complains that the dale-mist attended with a frost on
may-day had destroyed all his tender fruits; though there was a sharper frost the night
before without a mist, that did him no injury; and adds, that a garden not a stone's
throw from his own on a higher situation, being above the dale-mist, had received no
damage. Bradley, Vol. II. p. 232.</P>
<P>Mr. Hunter by very curious experiments discovered that the living principle in fish,
in vegetables, and even in eggs and seeds, possesses a power of resisting congelation.
Phil. Trans. There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid
the pain of cold may produce in them a greater quantity of heat, at least for a time,
but that vegetables, eggs, or seeds, should possess such a quality is truly wonderful.
Others have imagined that animals possess a power of preventing themselves from becom∣ing
much warmer than 98 degrees of heat, when immersed in an atmosphere above that
degree of heat. It is true that the increased exhalation from their bodies will in some
measure cool them, as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids, but this
is a chemical not an animal process. The experiments made by those who continued
<PB N="24" REF="253"/>
many minutes in the air of a room heated so much above any natural atmospheric heat,
do not seem conclusive, as they remained in it a less time than would have been neces∣sary
to have heated a mass of beef of the same magnitude, and the circulation of the blood
in living animals, by perpetually bringing new supplies of fluid to the skin, would prevent
the external surface from becoming hot much sooner than the whole mass. And thirdly,
there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in diseases, as in scarlet fever, in
which the increased action of the vessels of the skin produces heat and contributes to ex∣haust
the animal power already too much weakened.</P>
<P>It has been thought by many that frosts meliorate the ground, and that they are in
general salubrious to mankind. In respect to the former it is now well known that ice or
snow contain no nitrous particles, and though frost by enlarging the bulk of moist clay
leaves it softer for a time after the thaw, yet as soon as the water exhales, the clay becomes
as hard as before, being pressed together by the incumbent atmosphere, and by its self∣attraction,
called <HI>setting</HI> by the potters. Add to this that on the coasts of Africa, where
frost is unknown, the fertility of the soil is almost beyond our conceptions of it. In
respect to the general salubrity of frosty seasons the bills of mortality are an evidence in
the negative, as in long frosts many weakly and old people perish from debility occasioned
by the cold, and many classes of birds and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold
or destroyed by the consequent scarcity of food, and many tender vegetables perish from
the degree of cold.</P>
<P>I do not think it should be objected to this doctrine that there are moist days attended
with a brisk cold wind when no visible ice appears, and which are yet more disagreeable
and destructive than frosty weather. For on these days the cold moisture, which is de∣posited
on the skin is there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater
than the milder frosts. Whence even in such days both the disagreeable sensations and
insalubrious effects belong to the cause abovementioned, viz. the intensity of the cold.
Add to this that in these cold moist days as we pass along or as the wind blows upon us,
a new sheet of cold water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our
bodies, now as water is 800 times denser than air and is a much better conductor of heat,
we are starved with cold like those who go into a cold bath, both by the great number of
particles in contact with the skin and their greater facility of receiving our heat.</P>
<P>It may nevertheless be true that snows of long duration in our winters may be less in∣jurious
to vegetation than great rains and shorter frosts, for two reasons. 1. Because great
rains carry down many thousand pounds worth of the best part of the manure off the lands
into the sea, whereas snow dissolves more gradually and thence carries away less from the
land; any one may distinguish a snow-flood from a rain-flood by the transparency of the
water. Hence hills or fields with considerable inclination of surface should be ploughed
horizontally that the furrows may stay the water from showers till it deposits its mud.
2. Snow protects vegetables from the severity of the frost, since it is always in a state of
thaw where it is in contact with the earth; as the earth's heat is about 48° and the heat of
thawing snow is 32° the vegetables between them are kept in a degree of heat about 40,
by which many of them are preserved. See note on Muschus, Vol. II. of this work.</P>

<HEAD>ELECTRIC POINTS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was an idle dispute whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of
conductors for the defence of houses. The design of these conductors is to permit the
electric matter accumulated in the clouds to pass through them into the earth in a smaller
continued stream as the cloud approaches, before it comes to what is termed striking
distance; now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pass to points at a
much greater distance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt of their preference;
and it would seem that the finer the point and the less liable to become rusty the better,
as it would take off the lightening while it was still at a greater distance, and by that
means preserve a greater extent of building; the very extremity of the point should be of
pure silver or gold, and might be branched into a kind of brush, since one small point can
not be supposed to receive so great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the
earth.</P>
<P>If an insulated metallic ball is armed with a point, like a needle, projecting from one
part of it, the electric fluid will be seen in the dark to pass off from this point, so long as
the ball is kept supplied with electricity. The reason of this is not difficult to comprehend,
every part of the electric atmosphere which surrounds the insulated ball is attracted to
that ball by a large surface of it, whereas the electric atmosphere which is near the ex∣tremity
of the needle is attracted to it by only a single point, in consequence the particles
of electric matter near the surface of the ball approach towards it and push off by their
greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of the needle in a con∣tinued
stream.</P>
<P>Something like this happens in respect to the diffusion of oil on water from a pointed
cork, an experiment which was many years ago shewn me by Dr. Franklin; he cut a
piece of cork about the size of a letter-wafer and left on one edge of it a point about a
sixth of an inch in length projecting as a tangent to the circumference. This was dipped
in oil and thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the point
for a great many minutes. The oil descends from the floating cork upon the water
being diffused upon it without friction and perhaps without contact; but its going off at
the point so forcibly as to make the cork revolve in a contrary direction seems analogous
to the departure of the electric fluid from points.</P>
<P>Can any thing similar to either of these happen in respect to the earth's atmosphere
and give occasion to the breezes on the tops of mountains, which may be considered as
points on the earths circumference?</P>

<HEAD>FAIRY-RINGS.</HEAD>
<P>There is a phenomenon supposed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for, I
mean the Fairy-rings, as they are called, so often seen on the grass. The numerous
flashes of lightning which occur every summer are, I believe, generally discharged on
the earth, and but seldom (if ever) from one cloud to another. Moist trees are the
most frequent conductors of these flashes of lightning, and I am informed by purchasers
of wood that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured. At other times larger
parts or prominences of clouds gradually sinking as they move along, are discharged on
the moisture parts of grassy plains. Now this knob or corner of a cloud in being
attracted by the earth will become nearly cylindrical, as loose wool would do when
drawn out into a thread, and will strike the earth with a stream of electricity perhaps
two or ten yards in diameter. Now as a stream of electricity displaces the air it passes
through, it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it, but just the external ring of
this cylinder where the grass can have access to the air, since without air nothing can be
calcined. This earth after having been so calcined becomes a richer soil, and either fun∣guses
or a bluer grass for many years mark the place. That lightning displaces the air in
its passage is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it, which is owing to the sides of the
aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn. That nothing will
calcine without air is now well understood from the acids produced in the burning of
phlogistic substances, and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron prong
and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron-furnace; it may be held there
some seconds and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt, if it be passed
quickly into the flame and out again through the external part of it which is in contact
with the air. I know some circles of many yards diameter of this kind near Foremark
in Derbyshire which annually produce large white funguses and stronger grass, and
have done so, I am informed, above thirty years. This increased fertility of the ground
by calcination or charring, and its continuing to operate so many years is well worth the
attention of the farmer, and shews the use of paring and burning new turf in agri∣culture,
which produces its effect not so much by the ashes of the vegetable fibres as by
charring the soil which adheres to them.</P>
<P>These situations, whether from eminence or from moisture, which were proper once
to attract and discharge a thunder-cloud, are more liable again to experience the same.
Hence many fairy-rings are often seen near each other either without intersecting each
other, as I saw this summer in a garden in Nottinghamshire, or intersecting each other
as described on Arthur's seat near Edinburgh in the Edinb. Trans. Vol. II. p. 3.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XIV.—BUDS AND BULBS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Where dwell my vegetative realms benumb'd</L>
<L>In buds imprison'd, or in bulbs intomb'd. </L><BIBL>CANTO I. l. 465.</BIBL></Q>
<P>A TREE is properly speaking a family or swarm of buds, each bud being an in∣dividual
plant, for if one of these buds be torn or cut out and planted in the earth with
a glass cup inverted over it to prevent its exhalation from being at first greater than its
power of absorption, it will produce a tree similar to its parent; each bud has a leaf,
which is its lungs, appropriated to it, and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots
of these individual buds, whence old hollow trees are often seen to have some branches
flourish with vigour after the internal wood is almost intirely decayed and vanished.
According to this idea Linneus has observed that trees and shrubs are roots above
ground, for if a tree be inverted leaves will grow from the root-part and roots from the
trunk-part. Phil. Bot. p. 39. Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of pro∣pagating
themselves, the oviparous as by seeds, and the viviparous as by their buds and
bulbs, and that the individual plants, whether from seeds or buds or bulbs, are all annual
productions like many kinds of insects as the silk-worm, the parent perishing in the
autumn after having produced an embryon, which lies in a torpid state during the winter,
and is matured in the succeeding summer. Hence Linneus names buds and bulbs the
winter-cradles of the plant or hybernacula, and might have given the same term to
seeds. In warm climates few plants produce buds, as the vegetable life can be com∣pleated
in one summer, and hence the hybernacle is not wanted; in cold climates also
some plants do not produce buds, as philadelphus, srangula, viburnum, ivy, heath,
wood-nightshade, rue, geranium.</P>
<P>The bulbs of plants are another kind of winter-cradle, or hybernacle, adhering to
the descending trunk, and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants which are too
tender to bear the cold of the winter. The production of these subterraneous winter
lodges, is not yet perhaps clearly understood, they have been distributed by Linneus
according to their forms into scaly, solid, coated, and jointed bulbs, which however
does not elucidate their manner of production. As the buds of trees may be truly
esteemed individual annual plants, their roots constituting the bark of the tree, it follows
that these roots (viz. of each individual bud) spread themselves over the last years bark,
making a new bark over the old one, and thence descending cover with a new bark the
old roots also in the same manner. A similar circumstance I suppose to happen in
some herbaceous plants, that is, a new bark is annually produced over the old root, and
thus for some years at least the old root or caudex increases in size and puts up new
stems. As these roots increase in size the central part I suppose changes like the in∣ternal
wood of a tree and does not possess any vegetable life, and therefore gives out no
fibres or rootlets, and hence appears bitten off, as in valerian, plantain, and devil's-bit.
And this decay of the central part of the root I suppose has given occasion to the belief
of the root-fibres drawing down the bulb so much insisted on by Mr. Milne in his
Botanical Dictionary, Art. Bulb.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="257"/>
From the observations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at different
times of their growth, sent me by a young lady of nice observation, it appears probable
that all bulbous roots properly so called perish annually in this climate: Bradley, Miller,
and the Author of Spectacle de la Nature, observe that the tulip annually renews its
bulb, for the stalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat but on the outside
of the new bulb. This large new bulb is the flowering bulb, but besides this there are
other small new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one but from the
same caudex, (or circle from which the root-fibres spring;) these small bulbs are
leaf-bearing bulbs, and renew themselves annually with increasing size till they bear
flowers.</P>
<P>Miss—favoured me with the following curious experiment: She took a small
tulip-root out of the earth when the green leaves were sufficiently high to show the
flower, and placed it in a glass of water; the leaves and flower soon withered and the
bulb became wrinkled and soft, but put out one small side bulb and three bulbs beneath
descending an inch into the water by long processes from the caudex, the old bulb in some
weeks intirely decayed; on dissecting this monster, the middle descending bulb was found
by its process to adhere to the caudex and to the old flower-stem, and the side ones
were separated from the flower-stem by a few shrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex.
Whence she concludes that these last were off-sets or leaf-bulbs which should have been
seen between the coats of the new flower-bulb if it had been left to grow in the earth,
and that the middle one would have been the new flower-bulb. In some years (perhaps
in wet seasons) the florists are said to lose many of their tulip-roots by a similar process,
the new leaf-bulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex
without any new flower-bulbs.</P>
<P>By repeated dissections she observes that the leaf-bulbs or off-sets of tulip, crocus,
gladiolus, fritillary, are renewed in the same manner as the flowering-bulbs, contrary to
the opinion of many writers; this new leaf-bulb is formed on the inside of the coats
from whence the leaves grow, and is more or less advanced in size as the outer coats and
leaves are more or less shrivelled. In examining tulip, iris, hyacinth, hare-bell, the new
bulb was invariably found <HI>between</HI> the flower-stem and the base of the innermost leaf of
those roots which had flowered, and <HI>inclosed by</HI> the base of the innermost leaf in those
roots which had not flowered, in both cases adhering to the caudex or fleshy circle from
which the root-fibres spring.</P>
<P>Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually, but that this
is performed from the caudex within the old bulb, the outer coat of which does not so
shrivel as in crocus and fritillary and hence this change is not so apparent. But I
believe as soon as the flower is advanced the new bulbs may be seen on dissection, nor
does the annual increase of the size of the root of cyclamen and of aletris capensis mili∣tate
against this annual renewal of them, since the leaf-bulbs or off-sets, as described
above, are increased in size as they are annually renewed. See note on orchis, and on
anthoxanthum, in Vol. II. of this work.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XV.—SOLAR VOLCANOS.</HEAD>
<Q><L>From the deep craters of his realms of fire</L>
<L>The whirling sun this ponderous planet hurld. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l. 14.</BIBL></Q>
<P>DR. ALEXANDER WILSON, Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow, published
a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774, demonstrating that the spots in the
sun's disk are real cavities, excavations through the luminous material, which covers the
other parts of the sun's surface. One of these cavities he found to be about 4000 miles
deep and many times as wide. Some objections were made to this doctrine by M. De
la Laude in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1776, which however
have been ably answered by Professor Wilson in reply in the Philos. Trans, for 1783.
Keil observes, in his Astronomical Lectures, p. 44, <Q>We frequently see spots in the
sun which are larger and broader not only than Europe or Africa, but which even equal,
if they do not exceed, the surface of the whole terraqueous globe.</Q> Now that these
cavities are made in the sun's body by a process of nature similar to our earthquakes
does not seem improbable on several accounts. 1. Because from this discovery of Dr.
Wilson it appears that the internal parts of the sun are not in a state of inflammation or
of ejecting light, like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it; and hence
that a greater degree of heat or inflammation and consequent expansion or explosion
may occasionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus. 2. Because the solar spots
or cavities are frequently increased or diminished in size. 3. New ones are often pro∣duced.
4. And old ones vanish. 5. Because there are brighter or more luminous parts
of the sun's disk, called faculae by Scheiner and Hevelius, which would seem to be vol∣canos
in the sun, or, as Dr. Wilson calls them, <Q>eructations of matter more luminous
than that which covers the sun's surface.</Q> 6. To which may be added that all the
planets added together with their satellites do not amount to more than one six hundred
and fiftieth part of the mass of the sun according to Sir Isaac Newton.</P>
<P>Now if it could be supposed that the planets were originally thrown out of the sun
by larger sun-quakes than those frequent ones which occasion these spots or excavations
above-mentioned, what would happen? I. According to the observations and opinion
of Mr. Herschel the sun itself and all its planets are moving forwards round some other
centre with an unknown velocity, which may be of opake matter corresponding with the
very antient and general idea of a chaos. Whence if a ponderous planet, as Saturn,
could be supposed to be projected from the sun by an explosion, the motion of the sun
itself might be at the same time disturbed in such a manner as to prevent the planet
from falling again into it. 2. As the sun revolves round its own axis its form must
be that of an oblate spheroid like the earth, and therefore a body projected from its
surface perpendicularly upwards from that surface would not rise perpendicularly from
the sun's centre, unless it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or
<PB N="30" REF="259"/>
from its equator. Whence it may not be necessary that a planet if thus projected from
the sun by explosion should again fall into the sun. 3. They would part from the sun's
surface with the velocity with which that surface was moving, and with the velocity
acquired by the explosion, and would therefore move round the sun in the same direction
in which the sun rotates on its axis, and perform eliptic orbits. 4. All the planets would
move the same way round the sun, from this first motion acquired at leaving its surface,
but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the distance of the part,
where they were thrown out, from the sun's equator. Hence those which were ejected
near the sun's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other, as the primary
planets; the plain of all whose orbits are inclined but seven degrees and a half from each
other. Others which were ejected near the sun's poles would have much more eccentric
orbits, as they would partake so much less of the sun's rotatory motion at the time they
parted from his surface, and would therefore be carried further from the sun by the
velocity they had gained by the explosion which ejected them, and become comets.
5. They would all obey the same laws of motion in their revolutions round the sun;
this has been determined by astronomers, who have demonstrated that they move through
equal areas in equal times. 6. As their annual periods would depend on the height they
rose by the explosion, these would differ in them all. 7. As their diurnal revolutions
would depend on one side of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the
time it was torn off by the explosion, these would also differ in the different planets, and
not bear any proportion to their annual periods. Now as all these circumstances coincide
with the known laws of the planetary system, they serve to strengthen this conjecture.</P>
<P>This coincidence of such a variety of circumstances induced M. de Buffon to suppose
that the planets were all struck off from the sun's surface by the impact of a large comet,
such as approached so near the sun's disk, and with such amazing velocity, in the year
1680, and is expected to return in 2255. But Mr. Buffon did not recollect that these
comets themselves are only planets with more eccentric orbits, and that therefore it must
be asked, what had previously struck off these comets from the sun's body? 2. That if
all these planets were struck off from the sun at the same time, they must have been so
near as to have attracted each other and have formed one mass: 3. That we shall want
new causes for separating the secondary planets from the primary ones, and must there∣fore
look out for some other agent, as it does not appear how the impulse of a comet
could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were
driven off from the surface of the sun.</P>
<P>If it should be asked, why new planets are not frequently ejected from the sun? it
may be answered, that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the elastic
vapours to escape, and hence, by the present appearance of the surface of our earth,
earthquakes prodigiously larger than any recorded in history have existed; the same cir∣cumstances
may have affected the sun, on whose surface there are appearances of vol∣canos,
as described above. Add to this, that some of the comets, and even the georgium
sidus, may, for ought we know to the contrary, have been emitted from the sun in more
<PB N="31" REF="260"/>
modern days, and have been diverted from their course, and thus prevented from re∣turning
into the sun, by their approach to some of the older planets, which is somewhat
countenanced by the opinion several philosophers have maintained, that the quantity of
matter of the sun has decreased. Dr. Halley observed, that by comparing the proportion
which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the sun in former times, with the
proportion between them at present, that the moon is found to be somewhat accelerated
in respect to the sun. Pemberton's View of Sir Isaac Newton, p. 247. And so large is
the body of this mighty luminary, that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make
scarcely any perceptible diminution of it, as mentioned above. The cavity mentioned
above, as measured by Dr. Wilson of 4000 miles in depth, not penetrating an hundredth
part of the sun's semi-diameter; and yet, as its width was many times greater than its
depth, was large enough to contain a greater body than our terrestrial world.</P>
<P>I do not mean to conceal, that from the laws of gravity unfolded by Sir Isaac Newton,
supposing the sun to be a sphere and to have no progressive motion, and not liable itself
to be disturbed by the supposed projection of the planets from it, that such planets must
return into the sun. The late Rev. William Ludlam, of Leicester, whose genius never
met with reward equal to its merits, in a letter to me, dated January, 1787, after having
shewn, as mentioned above, that planets so projected from the sun would return to it,
adds, <Q>That a body as large as the moon so projected, would disturb the motion of the
earth in its orbit, is certain; but the calculation of such disturbing forces is difficult.
The body in some circumstances might become a satellite, and both move round their
common centre of gravity, and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the
sun.</Q></P>
<P>There are other circumstances which might have concurred at the time of such sup∣posed
explosions, which would render this idea not impossible. I. The planets might be
thrown out of the sun at the time the sun itself was rising from chaos, and be attracted
by other suns in their vicinity rising at the same time out of chaos, which would prevent
them from returning into the sun. 2. The new planet in its course or ascent from the sun,
might explode and eject a satellite, or perhaps more than one, and thus by its course
being affected might not return into the sun. 3. If more planets were ejected at the
same time from the sun, they might attract and disturb each others course at the time
they left the body of the sun, or very soon afterwards, when they would be so much
nearer each other.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XVI.—CALCAREOUS EARTH.</HEAD>
<Q><L>While Ocean wrap'd it in his azure robe.</L> <BIBL>CANTO II. 1. 34.</BIBL></Q>
<P>FROM having observed that many of the highest mountains of the world consist of
lime-stone replete with shells, and that these mountains bear the marks of having been
lifted up by subterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe; and as lime-stone
replete with shells is found at the bottom of many of our deepest mines some philo∣sophers
have concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with
water which was peopled with its adapted animals; that the shells and bones of these
animals in a long series of time produced solid strata in the ocean surrounding the ori∣ginal
nucleus.</P>
<P>These strata consist of the accumulated exuviae of shell-fish, the animals perished
age after age but their shells remained, and in progression of time produced the amazing
quantities of lime-stone which almost cover the earth. Other marine animals called
coralloids raised walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous habita∣tions,
these perpendicular corralline rocks make some parts of the Southern Ocean highly
dangerous, as appears in the journals of Capt. Cook. From contemplating the immense
strata of lime-stone, both in respect to their extent and thickness, formed from these
shells of animals, philosophers have been led to conclude that much of the water of the
sea has been converted into calcareous earth by passing through their organs of digestion.
The formation of calcareous earth seems more particularly to be an animal process as the
formation of clay belongs to the vegetable economy; thus the shells of crabs and other
testaceous fish are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them; the
shells of eggs are first a mucous membrane, and the calculi of the kidneys and those
found in all other parts of our system which sometimes contain calcareous earth, seem
to originate from inflamed membranes; the bones themselves consist of calcareous earth
united with the phosphoric or animal acid, which may be separated by dissolving the
ashes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid; the various secretions of animals, as their
saliva and urine, abound likewise with calcareous earth, as appears by the incrustations
about the teeth and the sediments of urine. It is probable that animal mucus is a pre∣vious
process towards the formation of calcareous earth; and that all the calcareous
earth in the world which is seen in lime-stones, marbles, spars, alabasters, marls, (which
make up the greatest part of the earth's crust, as far as it has yet been penetrated,) have
been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the mass of water, and that
by these means the solid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an
increasing state and the water perpetually in a decreasing one.</P>
<P>After the mountains of shells and other recrements of aquatic animals were elevated
above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually dissolved by rains and dews
and oozing through were either perfectly crystallized in smaller cavities and formed
<PB N="33" REF="262"/>
calcareous spar, or were imperfectly crystallized on the roofs of larger cavities and pro∣duced
stalactites; or mixing with other undissolved shells beneath them formed marbles,
which were more or less crystallized and more or less pure; or lastly, after being dissolved,
the water was exhaled from them in such a manner that the external parts became solid,
and forming an arch prevented the internal parts from approaching each other so near as
to become solid, and thus chalk was produced. I have specimens of chalk formed at the
root of several stalactites, and in their central parts; and of other stalactites which are
hollow like quills from a similar cause, viz. from the external part of the stalactite harden∣ing
first by its evaporation, and thus either attracting the internal dissolved particles to
the crust, or preventing them from approaching each other so as to form a solid body.
Of these I saw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high street in
Edinburgh.</P>
<P>If this dissolved limestone met with vitriolic acid it was converted into alabaster,
parting at the same time with its fixable air. If it met with the fluor acid it became fluor;
if with the siliceous acid, flint; and when mixed with clay and sand, or either of them,
acquires the name of marl. And under one or other of these forms composes a great
part of the solid globe of the earth.</P>
<P>Another mode in which limestone appears is in the form of round granulated par∣ticles,
but slightly cohering together; of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath,
perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide. The form of this calcareous sand, its angles
having been rubbed off, and the flatness of its bed, evinces that that part of the country
was so formed under water, the particles of sand having thus been rounded, like all other
rounded pebbles. This round form of calcareous sand and of other larger pebbles is
produced under water, partly by their being more or less soluble in water, and hence the
angular parts become dissolved, first, by their exposing a larger surface to the action of the
menstruum, and secondly, from their attrition against each other by the streams or tides,
for a great length of time, successively as they were collected, and perhaps when some of
them had not acquired their hardest state.</P>
<P>This calcareous sand has generally been called ketton-stone and believed to resemble
the spawn of fish, it has acquired a form so much rounder than siliceous sand from its
being of so much softer a texture and also much more soluble in water. There are
other soft calcareous stones called tupha which are deposited from water on mosses, as at
Matlock, from which moss it is probable the water may receive something which induces
it the readier to part with its earth.</P>
<P>In some lime-stones the living animals seem to have been buried as well as their shells
during some great convulsion of nature, these shells contain a black coaly substance
within them, in others some phlogiston or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead
animals remains mixed with the stone, which is then called liver-stone as it emits a
sulphurous smell on being struck, and there is a stratum about six inches thick extends a
considerable way over the iron ore at Wingerworth near Chesterfield in Derbyshire
which seems evidently to have been formed from the shells of fresh-water muscles</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="263"/>
There is however another source of calcareous earth besides the aquatic one above
described and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables as found in
marls, which consist of various mixtures of calcareous earth, sand, and clay, all of
them perhaps principally from vegetable origin.</P>
<P>Dr. Hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been softened by fire into
a fluid mass, which he thinks under immense pressure might be done without the escape
of their carbonic acid or fixed air. Edinb. Transact. Vol. I. If this ingenious idea be
allowed it might account for the purity of some white marbles, as during their fluid
state there might be time for their partial impurities, whether from the bodies of the
animals which produced the shells or from other extraneous matter, either to sublime
to the uppermost part of the stratum or to subside to the lowermost part of it. As a
confirmation of this theory of Dr. Hutton's it may be added that some calcareous
stones are found mixed with lime, and have thence lost a part of their fixed air or
carbonic gas, as the bath-stone, and on that account hardens on being exposed to the
air, and mixed with sulphur produces calcareous liver of sulphur. Falconer on Bath∣water.

<HEAD>NOTE XVII.—MORASSES.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Gnomes! you then taught transuding dews to pass</L>
<L>Through time-fallen woods, and root-inwove morass.</L><BIBL> CANTO II. l. 113.</BIBL></Q>
<P>WHERE woods have repeatedly grown and perished morasses are in process of
time produced, and by their long roots fill up the interstices till the whole becomes for
many yards deep a mass of vegetation. This fact is curiously verified by an account
given many years ago by the Earl of Cromartie, of which the following is a short
abstract.</P>
<P>In the year 1651 the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then nineteen years of age saw a
plain in the parish of Lockburn covered over with a firm standing wood, which was so
old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally
thrown off, which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the universal
manner in which fir-woods terminated, and that in twenty or thirty years the trees
would cast themselves up by the roots. About fifteen years after he had occasion to
travel the same way and observed that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a
root of any of them; but in their place the whole plain where the wood stood was
<PB N="35" REF="264"/>
covered with a flat green moss or morass, and on asking the country people what was
become of the wood he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it
away, but that it had all been overturned by the wind, that the trees lay thick over each
other, and that the moss or bog had overgrown the whole timber, which they added was
occasioned by the moisture which came down from the high hills above it and stagnated
upon the plain, and that nobody could yet pass over it, which however his Lordship was
so incautious as to attempt and slipt up to the arm-pits. Before the year 1699 that whole
piece of ground was become a solid moss wherein the peasants then dug turf or peat,
which however was not yet of the best sort. Philos. Trans. No. 330. Abridg. Vol. V.
p. 272.</P>
<P>Morasses in great length of time undergo variety of changes, first by elutriation, and
afterwards by fermentation, and the consequent heat. 1. By water perpetually oozing
through them the most soluble parts are first washed away, as the essential salts, these
together with the salts from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the
sea, where all of them seem to decompose each other except the marine salt. Hence
the ashes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not used in the countries,
where peat constitutes the fuel of the lower people, for the purpose of washing linen.
The second thing which is always seen oozing from morasses is iron in solution, which
produces chalybeate springs, from whence depositions of ochre and variety of iron ores.
The third elutriation seems to consist of vegetable acid, which by means unknown
appears to be converted into all other acids. 1. Into marine and nitrous acids as
mentioned above. 2. Into vitriolic acid which is found in some morasses so plentifully
as to preserve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them,
and this acid carried away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces
gypsum or alabaster, with clay it produces alum, and deprived of its vital air produces
sulphur. 3. Fluor acid which being washed away and meeting with calcareous earth
produces fluor or cubic spar. 4. The siliceous acid which seems to have been dis∣seminated
in great quantity either by solution in water or by solution in air, and appears
to have produced the sand in the sea uniting with calcareous earth previously dissolved
in that element, from which were afterwards formed some of the grit-stone rocks by
means of a siliceous or calcareous cement. By its union with the calcareous earth of
the morass other strata of siliceous sand have been produced; and by the mixture of
this with clay and lime arose the beds of marl.</P>
<P>In other circumstances, probably where less moisture has prevailed, morasses seem to
have undergone a fermentation, as other vegetable matter, new hay for instance is liable
to do from the great quantity of sugar it contains. From the great heat thus produced
in the lower parts of immense beds of morass the phlogistic part, or oil, or asphaltum,
becomes distilled, and rising into higher strata becomes again condensed forming coal∣beds
of greater or less purity according to their greater or less quantity of inflammable
matter; at the same time the clay beds become purer or less so, as the phlogistic part is
more or less completely exhaled from them. Though coal and clay are frequently pro∣duced
in this manner, yet I have no doubt, but that they are likewise often produced by
<PB N="36" REF="265"/>
elutriation; in situations on declivities the clay is washed away down into the valleys,
and the phlogistic part or coal left behind; this circumstance is seen in many valleys near
the beds of rivers, which are covered recently by a whitish impure clay, called water∣clay.
See note XIX. XX. and XXIII.</P>
<P>LORD CROMARTIE has furnished another curious observation on morasses in the
paper above referred to. In a moss near the town of Eglin in Murray, though there is
no river or water which communicates with the moss, yet for three or four feet of depth
in the moss there are little shell-fish resembling oysters with living fish in them in great
quantities, though no such fish are found in the adjacent rivers, nor even in the water
pits in the moss, but only in the solid substance of the moss. This curious fact not
only accounts for the shells sometimes found on the surface of coals, and in the clay
above them; but also for a thin stratum of shells which sometimes exists over iron-ore.</P>

<Q><L>Cold waves, immerged, the glowing mass congeal,</L>
<L>And turn to adamant the hissing Steel.</L><BIBL> CANTO II. l. 191.</BIBL></Q>
<P>AS iron is formed near the surface of the earth, it becomes exposed to streams of
water and of air more than most other metallic bodies, and thence becomes combined
with oxygene, or vital air, and appears very frequently in its calciform state, as in variety
of ochres. Manganese, and zinc, and sometimes lead, are also found near the surface of
the earth, and on that account become combined with vital air and are exhibited in their
calciform state.</P>
<P>The avidity with which iron unites with oxygene, or vital air, in which process
much heat is given out from the combining materials, is shewn by a curious experiment
of M. Ingenhouz. A fine iron wire twisted spirally is fixed to a cork, on the point of the
spire is fixed a match made of agaric dipped in solution of nitre; the match is then
ignited, and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air, the
match first burns vividly, and the iron soon takes fire and consumes with brilliant sparks
till it is reduced to small brittle globules, gaining an addition of about one third of its
weight by its union with vital air. Annales de Chymic. Traité de Chimie, per
Lavoisier, c. iii.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="37" REF="266"/>
<HEAD>STEEL.</HEAD>
<P>It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds with so great
avidity, that iron on being kept many hours or days in ignited charcoal becomes con∣verted
into steel, and thence acquires the faculty of being welded when red hot long
before it melts, and also the power of becoming hard when immersed in cold water;
both which I suppose depend on the same cause, that is, on its being a worse conductor
of heat than other metals; and hence the surface both acquires heat much sooner, and
loses it much sooner, than the internal parts of it, in this-circumstance resembling glass.</P>
<P>When steel is made very hot, and suddenly immerged in very cold water, and moved
about in it, the surface of the steel becomes cooled first, and thus producing a kind of
case or arch over the internal part, prevents that internal part from contracting quite so
much as it otherwise would do, whence it becomes brittler and harder, like the glass∣drops
called Prince Rupert's drops, which are made by dropping melted glass into cold
water. This idea is countenanced by the circumstance that hardened steel is specifically
lighter than steel which is more gradually cooled. (Nicholson's Chemistry, p. 313.)
Why the brittleness and hardness of steel or glass should keep pace or be companions to
each other may be difficult to conceive.</P>
<P>When a steel spring is forcibly bent till it break, it requires less power to bend it
through the first inch than the second, and less through the second than the third; the
same I suppose to happen if a wire be distended till it break by hanging weights to it;
this shews that the particles may be forced from each other to a small distance by less
power, than is necessary to make them recede to a greater distance; in this circumstance
perhaps the attraction of cohesion differs from that of gravitation, which exerts its power
inversely as the squares of the distance. Hence it appears that is the innermost particles
of a steel bar, by cooling the external surface first, are kept from approaching each other
so nearly as they otherwise would do, that they become in the situation of the particles
on the convex side of a bent spring, and can not be forced further from each other except
by a greater power than would have been necessary to have made them recede thus far.
And secondly, that if they be forced a little further from each other they separate; this
may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other, the contrary
poles together, then drawing them longitudinally from each other, they will slide with
small force till they begin to separate, and will then require a stronger force to really
separate them. Hence it appears, that hardness and brittleness depend on the same cir∣cumstance,
that the particles are removed to a greater distance from each other and thus
resist any power more forcibly which is applied to displace them further, this constitutes
hardness. And secondly, if they are displaced by such applied force they immediately
separate, and this constitutes brittleness.</P>
<P>Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purposes, on which account artists
have means of softening it again, by exposing it to certain degrees of heat, for the con∣struction
of different kinds of tools, which is called tempering it. Some artists plunge
large tools in very cold water as soon as they are compleatly ignited, and moving it about,
<PB N="38" REF="267"/>
take it out as soon as it ceases to be luminous beneath the water; it is then rubbed
quickly with a file or on sand to clean the surface, the heat which the metal still retains
soon begins to produce a succession of colours; if a hard temper be required, the piece
is dipped again and stirred about in cold water as soon as the yellow tinge appears, if
it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit for gravers' tools used in work∣ing
upon metals; if cooled while blue it is proper for springs. Nicholson's Chemistry,

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON.</HEAD>
<P>The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow
from morasses which lie upon gravel-beds, and which must therefore have produced
iron after those gravel-beds were raised out of the sea. On the south side of the road
between Cheadle and Okeymoor in Staffordshire, yellow stains of iron are seen to pene∣trate
the gravel from a thin morass on its surface. There is a fissure eight or ten feet
wide, in a gravel-bed on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill about a
mile from Trentham in Staffordshire, leading toward Drayton in Shropshire, which
fissure is filled up with nodules of iron-ore. A bank of sods is now raised against this
fissure to prevent the loose iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road, and thus
this natural curiosity is at present concealed from travellers. A similar fissure in a bed
of marl, and filled up with iron nodules and with some large pieces of flint, is seen on
the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill from the turnpike house about a
mile from Derby in the road towards Burton. And another such fissure filled with iron
nodes, appears about half a mile from Newton-Solney in Derbyshire, in the road to
Burton, near the summit of the hill. These collections of iron and of flint must have
been produced posterior to the elevation of all those hills, and were thence evidently of
vegetable or animal origin. To which should be added, that iron is found in general in
beds either near the surface of the earth, or stratified with clay coals or argillaceous grit,
which are themselves productions of the modern world, that is, from the recrements of
vegetables and air-breathing animals.</P>
<P>Not only iron but mangancse, calamy, and even copper and lead appear in some
instances to have been of recent production. Iron and manganese are detected in all
vegetable productions, and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exist
in vegetable or animal matters, if we had tests to detect them in very minute quantities.
Manganese and calamy are found in beds like iron near the surface of the earth, and in
a calciform state, which countenances their modern production. The recent production
of calamy, one of the ores of zinc, appears from its frequently incrusting calcareous spar
in its descent from the surface of the earth into the uppermost fissures of the limestone
mountains of Derbyshire. That the calamy has been carried by its solution or diffusion
in water into these cavities, and not by its ascent from below in form of steam, is evinced
from its not only forming a crust over the dogtooth spar, but by its afterwards dissolving
or destroying the sparry crystal. I have specimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth
spar, two inches high, which are hollow, and stand half an inch above the diminished
<PB N="39" REF="268"/>
sparry crystal on which they were formed, like a sheath a great deal too big for it; this
seems to shew, that this process was carried on in water, otherwise after the calamy had
incrusted its spar, and dissolved its surface, so as to form a hollow cavern over it, it could
not act further upon it except by the interposition of some medium. As these spars and
calamy are formed in the fissures of mountains they must both have been formed after
the elevation of those mountains.</P>
<P>In respect to the recent production of copper, it was before observed in note on
Canto II. l. 394, that the summit of the grit-stone mountain at Hawkstone in Shropshire,
is tinged with copper, which from the appearance of the blue stains seems to have
descended to the parts of the rock beneath. I have a calciform ore of copper consisting
of the hollow crusts of cubic cells, which has evidently been formed on crystals of fluor,
which it has eroded in the same manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous crystals,
from whence may be deduced in the same manner, the aqueous solution or diffusion, as
well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper.</P>
<P>Lead in small quantities is sometimes found in the fissures of coal-beds, which fis∣sures
are previously covered with spar; and sometimes in nodules of iron-ore. Of the
former I have a specimen from near Caulk in Derbyshire, and of the latter from Cole∣brook
Dale in Shropshire. Though all these facts shew that some metallic bodies are
formed from vegetable or animal recrements, as iron, and perhaps manganese and
calamy, all which are found near the surface of the earth; yet as the other metals are
found only in fissures of rocks, which penetrate to unknown depths, they may be wholly
or in part produced by ascending steams from subterraneous fires, as mentioned in note
on Canto II. l. 394.</P>

<HEAD>SEPTARIA OF IRON-STONE.</HEAD>
<P>Over some lime works at Walsall in Staffordshire, I observed some years ago a stratum
of iron earth about six inches thick, full of very large cavities; these cavities were evi∣dently
produced when the material passed from a semifluid state into a solid one; as the
frit of the potters, or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying; which is
owing to the further contraction of the internal part, after the crust is become hard.
These hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter, as I believe gypsum, and some∣times
spar, and even lead; a curious specimen of the last was presented to me by Mr.
Darby of Colebrook Dale, which contains in its cavity some ounces of lead-ore. But
there are other septaria of iron-stone which seem to have had a very different origin, their
cavities having been formed in cooling or congealing from an ignited state, as is inge∣niously
deduced by Dr. Hutton from their internal struture. Edinb. Transact. Vol. I.
p. 246. The volcanic origin of these curious septaria appears to me to be further evinced
from their form and the places where they are found. They consist of oblate spheroids
and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they
lie, as at East Lothian in Scotland. Two of these, which now lie before me, were found
with many others immersed in argillaceous shale or shiver, surrounded by broken lime∣stone
mountains at Bradbourn near Ashbourn in Derbyshire, and were presented to
<PB N="40" REF="269"/>
me by Mr. Buxton, a gentleman of that town. One of these is about fifteen inches in
its equatorial diameter, and about six inches in its polar one, and contains beautiful star∣like
septaria incrusted and in part filled with calcareous spar. The other is about eight
inches in its equatorial diameter, and about four inches in its polar diameter, and is quite
solid, but shews on its internal surface marks of different colours, as if a beginning sepa∣ration
had taken place. Now as these septaria contain fifty per cent, of iron, according
to Dr. Hutton, they would soften or melt into a semifluid globule by subterraneous fire
by less heat than the limestone in their vicinity; and if they were ejected through a hole
or fissure would gain a circular motion along with their progressive one by their greater
friction or adhesion to one side of the hole. This whirling motion would produce the
oblate spheroidical form which they possess, and which as far as I know can not in any
other way be accounted for. They would then harden in the air as they rose into the
colder parts of the atmosphere; and as they descended into so soft a material as shale or
shiver, their forms would not be injured in their fall; and their presence in materials so
different from themselves becomes accounted for.</P>
<P>About the tropics of the large septarium above mentioned, are circular eminent lines,
such as might have been left is it had been coarsely turned in a lathe. These lines seem
to consist of a fluid matter, which seems to have exsuded in circular zones, as their edges
appear blunted or retracted; and the septarium seems to have split easier in such sections
parallel to its equator. Now as the crust would first begin to cool and harden after its
ejection in a semifluid state, and the equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged
as it rose in the air; the internal parts being softer would slide beneath the polar crust,
which might crack and permit part of the semifluid to exsude, and it is probable the
adhesion would thus become less in sections parallel to the equator. Which further
confirms this idea of the production of these curious septaria. A new-cast cannon ball
red-hot with its crust only solid, if it were shot into the air would propably burst in its
passage; as it would consist of a more fluid material than these septaria; and thus
by discharging a shower of liquid iron would produce more dreadful combustion, if used
in war, than could be effected by a ball, which had been cooled and was heated again:
since in the latter case the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the
crust of it, without first loosing its form.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>1. SILICEOUS ROCKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE great masses of siliceous sand which lie in rocks upon the beds of limestone, or
which are stratified with clay, coal, and iron-ore, are evidently produced in the decom∣position
of vegetable or animal matters, as explained in the note on morasses. Hence
the impressions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in sand-stone, as
well as in coals and iron-ore. In these sand-rocks both the siliceous acid and the cal∣careous
base seem to be produced from the materials of the morass; for though the
prefence of a siliceous acid and of a calcareous base have not yet been separately exhibited
from flints, yet from the analogy of flint to fluor, and gypsum, and marble, and from
the conversion of the latter into flint, there can be little doubt of their existence.</P>
<P>These siliceous sand-rocks are either held together by a siliceous cement, or have a
greater or less portion of clay in them, which in some acts as a cement to the siliceous
crystals, but in others is in such great abundance that in burning them they become an
imperfect porcelain and are then used to repair the roads, as at Chesterfield in Derbyshire;
these are called argillaceous grit by Mr. Kirwan. In other places a calcareous matter
cements the crystals together; and in other places the siliceous crystals lie in loose strata
under the marl in the form of white sand; as at Normington about a mile from Derby.</P>
<P>The lowest beds of siliceous sand-stone produced from morasses seem to obtain their
acid from the morass, and their calcareous base from the limestone on which it rests.
These beds possess a siliceous cement, and from their greater purity and hardness are
used for course grinding-stones and scyth stones, and are situated on the edges of lime∣stone
countries, having lost the other strata of coals, or clay, or iron, which were origi∣nally
produced above them. Such are the sand-rocks incumbent on limestone near
Matlock in Derbyshire. As these siliceous sand-rocks contain no marine productions
scattered amongst them, they appear to have been elevated, torn to pieces, and many
fragments of them scattered over the adjacent country by explosions, from fires within
the morass from which they have been formed; and which dissipated every thing in∣flammable
above and beneath them, except some stains of iron, with which they are in
some places spotted. If these sand-rocks had been accumulated beneath the sea, and
elevated along with the beds of limestone on which they rest, some vestiges of marine
shells either in their siliceous or calcareous state must have been discerned amongst
them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<PB N="42" REF="271"/>
<HEAD>2. SILICEOUS TREES.</HEAD>
<P>In many of these sand-rocks are found the impressions of vegetable roots, which seem
to have been the most unchangeable parts of the plant, as shells and shark's teeth are
found in chalk-beds from their being the most unchangeable parts of the animal. In
other instances the wood itself is penetrated, and whole trees converted into flint; speci∣mens
of which I have by me, from near Covenery, and from a gravel-pit in Shropshire
near Child's Archal in the road to Drayton. Other polished specimens of vegetable
flints abound in the cabinets of the curious, which evidently shew the concentric circles
of woody fibres, and their interstices filled with whiter siliceous matter, with the branch∣ing
off of the knots when cut horizontally, and the parallel lines of wood when cut
longitudinally, with uncommon beauty and variety. Of these I possess some beautiful
specimens, which were presented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge.</P>
<P>The colours of these siliceous vegetables are generally brown, from the iron, I suppose,
or manganese, which induced them to crystallize or to fuse more easily. Some of the
cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony, and others of them
remain hollow, lined with innumerable small crystals tinged with iron, which I suppose
had a share in converting their calcareous matter into siliceous crystals, because the
crystals called Peak-diamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth; and those
called Bristol-stones are situated on limestone coloured with iron. Mr. F. French presented
me with a congeries of siliceous crystals, which he gathered on the crater (as he supposes)
of an extinguished volcano at Cromach Water in Cumberland. The crystals are about
an inch high in the shape of dogtooth or calcareous spar, covered with a dark ferruginous
matter. The bed on which they rest is about an inch in thickness, and is stained with
iron on its undersurface. This curious fossil shews the transmutation of calcareous earth
into siliceous, as much as the siliceous shells which abound in the cabinets of the curious.
There may sometime be discovered in this age of science, a method of thus impregnating
wood with liquid flint, which would produce pillars for the support, and tiles for the
covering of houses, which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth
beneath them.</P>
<P>That some siliceous productions have been in a fluid state without much heat at the
time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints above described not having quite
lost their organized appearance; from shells, and coralloids, and entrochi being converted
into flint without loosing their form; from the bason of calcedony round Giesar in
Iceland; and from the experiment of Mr. Bergman, who obtained thirteen regular formed
crystals by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel with fluor acid for two
years; these crystals were about the size of small peas, and were not so hard as quartz.
Opusc. de Terrâ Siliceâ, p. 33. Mr. Achard procured both calcareous and siliceous
crystals, one from calcareous earth, and the other from the earth of alum, both dissolved
in water impregnated with fixed air; the water filtrating very slowly through a porous
bottom of baked clay. See Journal de Physique, for January, 1778.</P>

<HEAD>3. AGATES, ONYXES, SCOTS-PEBBLES.</HEAD>
<P>In small cavities of these sand-rocks, I am informed, the beautiful siliceous nodules are
found which are called Scot's-pebbles; and which on being cut in different directions
take the names of agates, onyxes, sardonyxes, &amp;c. according to the colours of the lines
or strata which they exhibit. Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with crystals,
others have a nucleus of less compact siliceous matter which is generally white, surrounded
with many concentric strata coloured with iron, and other alternate strata of white agate
or calcedony, sometimes to the number of thirty.</P>
<P>I think these nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fusion by
either heat alone, or by water and heat, under great pressure, according to the ingenious
theory of Dr. Hutton; but I do not imagine, that they were injected into cavities from
materials from without, but that some vegetables or parts of vegetables containing
more iron or manganese than others, facilitated the compleat fusion, thus destroying
the vestiges of vegetable organization, which were conspicuous in the siliceous trees
above mentioned. Some of these nodules being hollow and lined with crystals, and
others containing a nucleus of white siliceous matter of a looser texture, shew they
were composed of the materials then existing in the cavity; which consisting before of
loose sand, must take up less space when fused into a solid mass.</P>
<P>These siliceous nodules resemble the nodules of iron-stone mentioned in note on
Canto II. l. 179, in respect to their possessing a great number of concentric spheres
coloured generally with iron, but they differ in this circumstance, that the concentric
spheres generally obey the form of the external crust, and in their not possessing a chaly∣beate
nucleus. The stalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in
concentric strata, by their coats being spread over each other at different times; and some
of them, as the cupreous ones, possess great beauty from this formation; but as these are
necessarily more or less of a cylindrical or conic form, the nodules or globular flints
above described cannot have been constructed in this manner. To what law of nature
then is to be referred the production of such numerous concentric spheres? I suspect to
the law of congelation.</P>
<P>When salt and water are exposed to severe frosty air, the salt is said to be precipitated
as the water freezes; that is, as the heat, in which it was dissolved, is withdrawn; where
the experiment is tried in a bowl or bason, this may be true, as the surface freezes first,
and the salt is found at the bottom. But in a fluid exposed in a thin phial, I found by
experiment, that the extraneous matter previously dissolved by the heat in the mixture
was not simply set at liberty to subside, but was detruded or pushed backward as the ice
was produced. The experiment was this: about two ounces of a solution of blue
vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial, the glass was cracked and fallen to pieces,
the ice was dissolved, and I found a pillar of blue vitriol standing erect on the bottom
of the broken bottle. Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary, than that
by its powerful and sudden expansion it should burst iron shells and coehorns, or throw
<PB N="44" REF="273"/>
out the plugs with which the water was secured in them above one hundred and thirty
yards, according to the experiments at Quebec by Major Williams. Edinb. Transact.
Vol. II. p. 23.</P>
<P>In some siliceous nodules which now lie before me, the external crust for about the
tenth of an inch consists of white agate, in others it is much thinner, and in some much
thicker; corresponding with this crust there are from twenty to thirty superincumbent
strata, of alternately darker and lighter colour; whence it appears, that the external crust
as it cooled or froze, propelled from it the iron or manganese which was dissolved in it;
this receded till it had formed an arch or vault strong enough to resist its further pro∣trusion;
then the next inner sphere or stratum as it cooled or froze, propelled forwards
its colouring matter in the same manner, till another arch or sphere produced sufficient
resistance to this frigorific expulsion. Some of them have detruded their colouring
matter quite to the centre, the rings continuing to become darker as they are nearer it;
in others the chalybeate arch seems to have stopped half an inch from the centre, and
become thicker by having attracted to itself the irony matter from the white nucleus,
owing probably to its cooling less precipitately in the central parts than at the surface of
the pebble.</P>
<P>A similar detrusion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults obtains in the salt
mines in Cheshire; from whence Dr. Hutton very ingeniously concludes, that the salt
must have been liquified by heat; which would seem to be be much confirmed by the
above theory. Edinb. Transact. Vol. I. p. 244.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this account of Scots-pebbles without observing that some of them
on being sawed longitudinally asunder, seem still to possess some vestiges of the cylindrical
organization of vegetables; others possess a nucleus of white agate much resembling some
bulbous roots with their concentric coats, or the knots in elm-roots or crab-trees; some
of these I suppose were formed in the manner above explained, during the congelation
of masses of melted flint and iron; others may have been formed from a vegetable
nucleus, and retain some vestiges of the organization of the plant.</P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>4. SAND OF THE SEA.</HEAD>
<P>The great abundance of siliceous sand at the bottom of the ocean may in part be
washed down from the siliceous rocks above described, but in general I suppose it derives
its acid only from the vegetable and animal matter of morasses, which is carried down by
floods or by the atmosphere, and becomes united in the sea with its calcareous base from
shells and coralloids, and thus assumes its crystalline form at the bottom of the ocean, and is
there intermixed with gravel or other matters washed from the mountains in its vicinity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>5. CHERT, OR PETROSILEX.</HEAD>
<P>The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with strata of chert, or coarse
flint, and this in beds from one to three feet thick, as at Ilam and Matlock, or of less
than the tenth of an inch in thickness, as a mile or two from Bakewell in the road to
<PB N="45" REF="274"/>
Buxton. It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty strata of either lime∣stone
or flint, of different shades of white and black, could be laid quite regularly over
each other from sediments or precipitations from the sea; it appears to me much easier
to comprehend, by supposing with Dr. Hutton, that both the solid rocks of marble and
the flint had been fused by great heat, (or by heat and water,) under immense pressure;
by its cooling or congelating the colouring matter might be detruded, and form parallel
or curvilinean strata, as above explained.</P>
<P>The colouring matter both of limestone and flint was probably owing to the flesh of
peculiar animals, as well as the siliceous acid, which converted some of the limestone into
flint; or to some strata of shell-fish having been overwhelmed when alive with new
materials, while others dying in their natural situations would lose their fleshy parts,
either by its putrid solution in the water or by its being eaten by other sea-insects. I have
some calcareous fossil shells which contain a black coaly matter in them, which was
evidently the body of the animal, and others of the same kind filled with spar instead of
it. The Labradore stone has I suppose its colours from the nacre or mother-pearl shells,
from which it was probably produced. And there is a stratum of calcareous matter
about six or eight inches thick at Wingerworth in Derbyshire over the iron-beds, which
is replete with shells of fresh-water muscles, and evidently obtains its dark colour from
them, as mentioned in note XVI. Many nodules of flint resemble in colour as well as
in form the shell of the echinus or sea-urchin; others resemble some coralloids both
in form and colour; and M. Arduini found in the Monte de Pancrasio, red flints
branching like corals, from whence they seem to have obtained both their form and
their colour. Ferber's Travels in Italy, p. 42.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>6. NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALK-BEDS.</HEAD>
<P>As the nodules of flint found in chalk-beds possess no marks of having been rounded
by attrition or solution, I conclude that they have gained their form as well as their dark
colour from the flesh of the shell-fish from which they had their origin; but which have
been so compleatly fused by heat, or heat and water, as to obliterate all vestiges of the
shell, in the same manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of
vegetables, but which had been so completely fused as to obliterate all marks of their
organization, or as many iron-nodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar
vegetables.</P>
<P>Some nodules in chalk-beds consist of shells of echini filled up with chalk, the animal
having been dissolved away by putrescence in water, or eaten by other sea-insects; other
shells of echini, in which I suppose the animal's body remained, are converted into flint
but still retain the form of the shell. Others, I suppose as above, being more completely
fused, have become flint coloured by the animal flesh, but without the exact form either
of the flesh or shell of the animal. Many of these are hollow within and lined with
crystals, like the Scot's-pebbles above described; but as the colouring matter of animal
<PB N="46" REF="275"/>
bodies differs but little from each other compared with those of vegetables, these flints
vary less in their colours than those above mentioned. At the same time as they cooled
in concentric spheres like the Scot's-pebbles, they often possess faint rings of colours, and
always break in concholoid forms like them.</P>
<P>This idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalk-beds is countenanced from
the iron which generally appears as these flints become decomposed by the air; which
by uniting with the iron in their composition reduces it from a vitrescent state to that of
calx, and thus renders it visible. And secondly, by there being no appearance in chalk-beds
of a string or pipe of siliceous matter connecting one nodule with another, which
must have happened if the siliceous matter, or its acid, had been injected from without
according to the idea of Dr. Hutton. And thirdly, because many of them have very
large cavities at their centres, which should not have happened had they been formed by
the injection of a material from without.</P>
<P>When shells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to siliceous matter by the
flesh of the animal, the new flint being heavier than the shell or chalk occupies less space
than the materials it was produced from; this is the cause of frequent cavities within
them, where the whole mass has not been completely fused and pressed together. In
Derbyshire there are masses of coralloid and other shells which have become siliceous,
and are thus left with large vacuities sometimes within and sometimes on the outside of
the remaining form of the shell, like the French millstones, and I suppose might serve
the same purpose; the gravel of the Derwent is full of specimens of this kind.</P>
<P>Since writing the above I have received a very ingenious account of chalk-beds from
Dr. MENISH of Chelmsford. He distinguishes chalk-beds into three kinds; such as have
been raised from the sea with little disturbance of their strata, as the cliffs of Dover and
Margate, which he terms <HI>intire</HI> chalk. Another state of chalk is where it has suffered
much derangement, as the banks of the Thames at Gravesend and Dartford. And a
third state where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water, which he terms
<HI>alluvial</HI> chalk. In the first of these situations of chalk he observes, that the flint lies in
strata horizontally, generally in distinct nodules, but that he has observed two instances
of solid plates or strata of flint, from an inch to two inches in thickness, interposed
between the chalk-beds; one of these is in a chalk-bank by the road side at Berkhamstead,
the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury. Dr. Menish has
further observed, that many of the echini are crushed in their form, and yet filled with
flint, which has taken the form of the crushed shell, and that though many flint nodules
are hollow, yet that in some echini the siliceum seems to have enlarged, as it passed from
a fluid to a solid state, as it swells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the
shell, and that though these shells are so filled with flint yet that in many places the shell
itself remains calcareous. These strata of nodules and plates of flint seem to countenance
their origin from the flesh of a stratum of animals which perished by some natural
violence, and were buried in their shells.</P>

<PB N="47" REF="276"/>
<HEAD>7. ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND.</HEAD>
<P>In many rocks of siliceous sand the particles retain their angular form, and in some
beds of loose sand, of which there is one of considerable purity a few yards beneath the
marl at Normington about a mile south of Derby. Other siliceous sands have had their
angles rounded off, like the pebbles in gravel-beds. These seem to owe their globular
form to two causes; one to their attrition against each other, when they may for centuries
have lain at the bottom of the sea, or of rivers; where they may have been progressively
accumulated, and thus progressively at the same time rubbed upon each other by the
dashing of the water, and where they would be more easily rolled over each other by the
their gravity being so much less than in air. This is evidently now going on in the river
Derwent, for though there are no limestone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby,
yet a great part of the river-gravel at Derby consists of limestone nodules, whose angles
are quite worn off in their descent down the stream.</P>
<P>There is however another cause which must have contributed to round the angles
both of calcareous and siliceous fragments; and that is, their solubility in water; calca∣reous
earth is perpetually found suspended in the waters which pass over it; and the
earth of flints was observed by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of
one grain to a gallon. Kirwan's Mineralogy, p. 107. In boiling water, however, it is
soluble in much greater proportion, as appears from the siliceous earth sublimed in the
distillation of fluor acid in glass vessels; and from the basons of calcedony which sur∣rounded
the jets of hot water near mount Heccla in Iceland. Troil on Iceland. It is
probable most siliceous sands or pebbles have at some ages of the world been long exposed
to aqueous steams raised by subterranean fires. And if fragments of stone were long
immersed in a fluid menstrum, their angular parts would be first dissolved, on account of
their greater surface.</P>
<P>Many beds of siliceous gravel are cemented together by a siliceous cement, and are
called breccia; as the plumb-pudding stones of Hartfordshire, and the walls of a subter∣raneous
temple excavated by Mr. Curzon, at Hagley near Rugely in Staffordshire; these
may have been exposed to great heat as they were immersed in water; which water under
great pressure of superincumbent materials may have been rendered red-hot, as in Papin's
digester; and have thus possessed powers of solution with which we are unacquainted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>8. BASALTES AND GRANITES.</HEAD>
<P>Another sourse of siliceous stones is from the granite, or basaltes, or porphyries, which
are of different hardnesses according to the materials of their composition, or to the fire
they have undergone; such are the stones of Arthur's-hill near Edinburgh, of the Giant's
Causway in Ireland, and of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire; the uppermost stratum
of which last seems to have been cracked either by its elevation, or by its hastily cooling
after ignition by the contact of dews or snows, and thus breaks into angular fragments,
such as the streets of London are paved with; or have had their angles rounded by
<PB N="48" REF="277"/>
attrition or by partial solution; and have thus formed the common paving stones or
bowlers; as well as the gravel, which is often rolled into strata amid the siliceous sand∣beds,
which are either formed or collected in the sea.</P>
<P>In what manner such a mass of crystallized matter as the Giant's Causway and similar
columns of basaltes, could have been raised without other volcanic appearances, may be a
matter not easy to comprehend; but there is another power in nature besides that of
expansile vapour which may have raised some materials which have previously been in
igneous or aqueous solution; and that is the act of congelation. When the water in
the experiments above related of Major Williams had by congelation thrown out the
plugs from the bomb-shells, a column of ice rose from the hole of the bomb six or eight
inches high. Other bodies I suspect increase in bulk which crystallize in cooling, as iron
and type-metal. I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimstone into
a pot to cool and was surprized to see after a little time a part of the fluid beneath
break a hole in the congealed crust above it, and gradually rise into a promontory several
inches high; the basaltes has many marks of fusion and of crystallization and may
thence, as well as many other kinds of rocks, as of spar, marble, petrosilex, jasper, &amp;c.
have been raised by the power of congelation, a power whose quantity has not yet
been ascertained, and perhaps greater and more universal than that of vapours expanded
by heat. These basaltic columns rise sometimes out of mountains of granite itself, as
mentioned by Dr. Beddoes, (Phil. Transact. Vol. LXXX.) and as they seem to consist
of similar materials more completely fused, there is still greater reason to believe them
to have been elevated in the cooling or crystallization of the mass. See note XXIV.</P>

<Q><L>Whence ductile Clays in wide expansion spread,</L>
<L>Soft as the Cygnet's down, their snow-white bed. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l. 276.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE philosophers, who have attended to the formation of the earth, have ac∣knowledged
two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous
globe has undergone, and these are water and fire. Some of them have perhaps ascribed
too much to one of these great agents of nature, and some to the other. They have
generally agreed that the stratification of materials could only be produced from sediments
or precipitations, which were previously mixed or dissolved in the sea; and that whatever
effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards.</P>
<P>There is however great difficulty in accounting for the universal stratification of the
solid globe of the earth in this manner, since many of the materials, which appear in
strata, could not have been suspended in water; as the nodules of flint in chalk-beds,
the extensive beds of shells, and lastly the strata of coal, clay, sand, and iron-ore,
which in most coal-countries lie from five to seven times alternately stratified over each
other, and none of them are soluble in water. Add to this if a solution of them or a
mixture of them in water could be supposed, the cause of that solution must cease before
a precipitation could commence.</P>
<P>1. The great masses of lava, under the various names of granite, porphyry, toadstone,
moor-stone, rag, and slate, which constitute the old word, may have acquired the strati∣fication,
which some of them appear to possess, by their having been formed by suc∣cessive
eruptions of a fluid mass, which at different periods of antient time arose from
volcanic shafts and covered each other, the surface of the interior mass of lava would
cool and become solid before the superincumbent stratum was poured over it; to the
same cause may be ascribed their different compositions and textures, which are scarcely
the same in any two parts of the world.</P>
<P>2. The stratifications of the great masses of limestone, which were produced from
sea-shells, seem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable
shells were produced and deposited. A colony of echini, or madrepores, or cornua
ammonis, lived and perished in one period of time; in another a new colony of either
similar or different shells lived and died over the former ones, producing a stratum of
more recent shell over a stratum of others which had began to petrify or to become
marble; and thus from unknown depths to what are now the summits of mountains
the limestone is disposed in strata of varying solidity and colour. These have afterwards
undergone variety of changes by their solution and deposition from the water in which
they were immersed, or from having been exposed to great heat under great pressure,
according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, Edinb. Transact. Vol. I. Sec

3. In most of the coal-countries of this island there are from five to seven beds of
coal stratified with an equal number of beds, though of much greater thickness, of clay
and sandstone, and occasionally of iron-ores. In what manner to account for the
stratification of these materials seems to be a problem of greater difficulty. Philosophers
have generally supposed that they have been arranged by the currents of the sea;
but considering their insolubility in water, and their almost similar specific gravity, an
accumulation of them in such distinct beds from this cause is altogether inconceiveable,
though some coal-countries bear marks of having been at some time immersed beneath
the waves and raised again by subterranean fires.</P>
<P>The higher and lower parts of morasses were necessarily produced at different periods
of time, see Note XVII. and would thus originally be formed in strata of different
ages. For when an old wood perished, and produced a morass, many centuries would
elapse before another wood could grow and perish, again upon the same ground, which
would thus produce a new stratum of morass over the other, differing indeed principally
in its age, and perhaps, as the timber might be different, in the proportions of its
component parts.</P>
<P>Now if we suppose the lowermost stratum of a morass become ignited, like fermenting
hay, (after whatever could be carried away by solution in water was gone,) what would
happen? Certainly the inflammable part, the oil, sulphur, or bitumen, would burn
away, and be evaporated in air; and the fixed parts would be left, as clay, lime, and
iron; while some of the calcareous earth would join with the siliceous acid, and produce
sand, or with the argillaceous earth, and produce marl. Thence after many centuries
another bed would take fire, but with less degree of ignition, and with a greater body of
morass over it, what then would happen? The bitumen and sulphur would rise and
might become condensed under an impervious stratum, which might not be ignited, and
there form coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity, which would
permit some of the clay to subside through it into the place from which it was
sublimed.</P>
<P>Some centuries afterwards another similar process might take place, and either thicken
the coal-bed, or produce a new clay-bed, or marl, or sand, or deposit iron upon it,
according to the concomitant circumstances above mentioned.</P>
<P>I do not mean to contend that a few masses of some materials may not have been
rolled together by currents, when the mountains were much more elevated than at
present, and in consequence the rivers broader and more rapid, and the storms of rain
and wind greater both in quantity and force. Some gravel-beds may have been thus
washed from the mountains; and some white clay washed from morasses into valleys
beneath them; and some ochres of iron dissolved and again deposited by water; and
some calcareous depositions from water, (as the bank for instance on which stand the
houses at Matlock-bath;) but these are of small extent or consequence compared to
the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which form the nucleus of the earth, or to
the immense strata of limestone which crust over the greatest part of this granite or
porphyry; or lastly to the very extensive beds of clay, marl, sandstone, coal, and iron,
<PB N="51" REF="280"/>
which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of our continents and
islands, which were then elevated above the level of the sea, and which on that account
became covered with vegetation, and thence acquired their later or superincumbent
strata, which constitute, what some have termed, the new world.</P>
<P>There is another source of clay, and that of the finest kind, from decomposed
granite, this is of a snowy white and mixed with shining particles of mica, of this kind
is an earth from the country of Cherokees. Other kinds are from less pure lavas;
Mr. Ferber asserts that the sulphurous steams from Mount Vesuvius convert the lava
into clay.</P>
<P><Q>The lavas of the antient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous
nature, and these appear at present argillaceous. Some fragments of this lava are but
half or at one side changed into clay, which either is viscid or ductile, or hard and
stoney. Clays by fire are deprived of their coherent quality, which cannot be restored
to them by pulverization, nor by humectation. But the sulphureous Solfatara steams
restore it, as may be easily observed on the broken pots wherein they gather the sal
ammoniac; though very well baked and burnt at Naples they are mollified again by the
acid steams into a viscid clay which keeps the sormer fire-burnt colour. <BIBL>Travels in

<P>THE fine bright purples or rose colours which we see on china cups are not
producible with any other material except gold, manganese indeed gives a purple but of
a very different kind.</P>
<P>In Europe the application of gold to these purposes appears to be of modern invention.
Cassius's discovery of the precipitate of gold by tin, and the use of that precipitate for
colouring glass and enamels, are now generally known, but though the precipitate with
tin be more successful in producing the ruby glass, or the colourless glass which
becomes red by subsequent ignition, the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold
from separating, (which it is very liable to do during the fusion; yet, for enamels, the
precipitates made by alcaline salts answer equally well, and give a finer red, the colour
produced by the tin precipitate being a bluish purple, but with the others a rose red.
I am informed that some of our best artists prefer aurum fulminans, mixing it, before
it has become dry, with the white composition or enamel flux; when once it is divided
by the other matter, it is ground with great safety, and without the least danger of
explosion, whether moist or dry. The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth
by long grinding, which accordingly makes an essential circumstance in the process.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="281"/>
The precipitates of gold, and the colcothar or other red preparations of iron, are
called <HI>tender</HI> colours. The heat must be no greater than is just sufficient to make the
enamel run upon the piece, for if greater, the colours will be destroyed or changed to a
different kind. When the vitreous matter has just become fluid it seems as if the
coloured metallic calx remained barely <HI>intermixed</HI> with it, like a coloured powder of
exquisite tenuity suspended in water: but by stronger fire the calx is <HI>dissolved,</HI> and
metallic colours are altered by <HI>solution</HI> in glass as well as in acids or alcalies.</P>
<P>The Saxon mines have till very lately almost exclusively supplied the rest of Europe
with cobalt, or rather with its preparations, zaffre and smalt, for the exportation of the
ore itself is there a capital crime. Hungary, Spain, Sweden, and some other parts of the
continent, are now said to afford cobalts equal to the Saxon, and specimens have been
discovered in our own island, both in Cornwall and in Scotland; but hitherto in no
great quantity.</P>
<P>Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from those above mentioned in
their application for colouring enamels. In those the calx has previously acquired the
intended colour, a colour which bears a red heat without injury, and all that remains is
to fix it on the piece by a vitreous flux. But the blue colour of cobalt, and the green
or bluish green of copper, are <HI>produced</HI> by vitrification, that is, by <HI>solution</HI> in the glass, and
a strong fire is necessary for their perfection. These calces therefore, when mixed with
the enamel flux, are melted in crucibles, once or oftener, and the deep coloured opake
glass, thence resulting, is ground into unpalpable powder, and used for enamel. One
part of either of these calces is put to ten, sixteen, or twenty parts of the flux, according
to the depth of colour required. The heat of the enamel kiln is only a full red, such as
is marked on Mr. Wedgwood's thermometer 6 degrees. It is therefore necessary that
the flux be so adjusted as to melt in that low heat. The usual materials are flint, or
flint-glass, with a due proportion of red-led, or borax, or both, and sometimes a little tin
calx to give opacity.</P>
<P><HI>Ka-o-lin</HI> is the name given by the Chinese to their porcelain clay, and <HI>pe-tun-tse</HI> to the
other ingredient in their China ware. Specimens of both these have been brought into
England, and found to agree in quality with some of our own materials. Kaolin is the
very same with the clay called in Cornwall and the petuntse is a granite similar
to the Cornish moorstone. There are differences, both in the Chinese petuntses, and
the English moorstones; all of them contain micaceous and quartzy particles, in greater
or less quantity, along with feltspat, which last is the essential ingredient for the
porcelain manufactory. The only injurious material commonly found in them is iron,
which discolours the ware in proportion to its quantity, and which our moorstones are
perhaps more frequently tainted with than the Chinese. Very fine porcelain has been
made from English materials but the nature of the manufacture renders the process pre∣carious
and the profit hazardous; for the semivitrification, which constitutes porcelain,
is necessarily accompanied with a degree of softness, or semifusion, so that the vessels are
liable to have their forms altered in the kiln, or to run together with any accidental
augmentations of the fire.

<Q><L>Or bid Mortality rejoice or mourn</L>
<L>O'er the fine forms of Portland's mystic urn. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l 321.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE celebrated funereal vase, long in possession of the Barberini family, and lately
purchased by the Duke of Portland for a thousand guineas, is about ten inches high and
six in diameter in the broadest part. The figures are of most exquisite workmanship in
bas relief of white opake glass, raised on a ground of deep blue glass, which appears
black except when held against the light. Mr. Wedgwood is of opinion from many
circumstances that the figures have been made by cutting away the external crust of
white opake glass, in the manner the finest cameo's have been produced, and that it
must thence have been the labour of a great many years. Some antiquarians have
placed the time of its production many centuries before the christian aera; as sculpture
was said to have been declining in respect to its excellence in the time of Alexander the
Great. See an account of the Barberini or Portland vase by M. D'Hancarville, and by
Mr. Wedgwood.</P>
<P>Many opinions and conjectures have been published concerning the figures on this
celebrated vase. Having carefully examined one of Mr. Wedgwood's beautiful copies
of this wonderful production of art, I shall add one more conjecture to the number.</P>
<P>Mr. Wedgwood has well observed that it does not seem probable that the Portland
vase was purposely made for the ashes of any particular person deceased, because many
years must have been necessary for its production. Hence it may be concluded, that the
subject of its embellishments is not private history but of a general nature. This subject
appears to me to be well chosen, and the story to be finely told; and that it represents
what in antient times engaged the attention of philosophers, poets, and heroes, I mean a
part of the Eleusinian mysteries.</P>
<P>These mysteries were invented in Aegypt, and afterwards transferred to Greece, and
flourished more particularly at Athens, which was at the same time the seat of the fine
arts. They consisted of scenical exhibitions representing and inculcating the expectation
of a future life after death, and on this account were encouraged by the government,
insomuch that the Athenian laws punished a discovery of their secrets with death.
Dr. Warburton has with great learning and ingenuity shewn that the descent of Aeneas
into hell, described in the Sixth Book of Virgil, is a poetical account of the represen∣tations
of the future state in the Eleusinian mysteries. Divine Legation, Vol. I. p, 210.</P>
<P>And though some writers have differed in opinion from Dr. Warburton on this
subject, because Virgil has introduced some of his own heroes into the Elysian fields, as
Deiphobus, Palinurus, and Dido, in the same manner as Homer had done before him,
yet it is agreed that the received notions about a future state were exhibited in these
mysteries, and as these poets described those received notions, they may be said, as far as
these religious doctrines were concerned, to have described the mysteries.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="284"/>
Now as these were emblematic exhibitions they must have been as well adapted to
the purposes of sculpture as of poetry, which indeed does not seem to have been un∣common,
since one compartment of figures in the sheild of Aeneas represented the regions
of Tartarus. Aen. Lib. X. The procession of torches, which according to M. De St.
Croix was exhibited in these mysteries, is still to be seen in basso relievo, discovered by
Spon and Wheler. Memoires sur le Mysteres par De St. Croix. 1784. And it is very
probable that the beautiful gem representing the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, as de∣scribed
by Apulcus, was originally descriptive of another part of the exhibitions in these
mysteries, though afterwards it became a common subject of antient art. See Divine
Legat. Vol. I. p. 323. What subject could have been imagined so sublime for the
ornaments of a funereal urn as the mortality of all things and their resuscitation? Where
could the designer be supplied with emblems for this purpose, before the Christian aera,
but from the Eleusinian mysteries?</P>
<P>1. The exhibitions of the mysteries were of two kinds, those which the people were
permitted to see, and those which were only shewn to the initiated. Concerning the
latter, Aristides calls them <Q>the most shocking and most ravishing representations.</Q> And
Stoboeus asserts that the initiation into the grand mysteries exactly resembles death.
Divine Legat. Vol. I. p. 280, and p. 272. And Virgil in his entrance to the shades
below, amongst other things of terrible form, mentions death. Aen. VI. This part of
the exhibition seems to be represented in one of the compartments of the Portland
vase.</P>
<P>Three figures of exquisite workmanship are placed by the side of a ruined column
whose capital is fallen off, and lies at their feet with other disjointed stones, they sit on
loose piles of stone beneath a tree, which has not the leaves of any evergreen of this
climate, but may be supposed to be an elm, which Virgil places near the entrance of the
infernal regions, and adds, that a dream was believed to dwell under every leaf of it.
Aen. VI. l. 281. In the midst of this group reclines a female figure in a dying attitude,
in which extreme languor is beautifully represented, in her hand is an inverted torch, an
antient emblem of extinguished life, the elbow of the same arm resting on a stone supports
her as she sinks, while the other hand is raised and thrown over her drooping head, in
some measure sustaining it and gives with great art the idea of fainting lassitude. On
the right of her sits a man, and on the left a woman, both supporting themselves on their
arms, as people are liable to do when they are thinking intensely. They have their
backs towards the dying figure, yet with their faces turned towards her, as if seriously
contemplating her situation, but without stretching out their hands to assist her.</P>
<P>This central figure then appears to me to be an hieroglyphic or Eleusinian emblem of
MORTAL LIFF, that is, the lethum, or death, mentioned by Virgil amongst the terrible
things exhibited at the beginning of the mysteries. The inverted torch shews the
figure to be emblematic, if it had been designed to represent a real person in the act of
dying there had been no necessity for the expiring torch, as the dying figure alone would
have been sufficiently intelligible;—it would have been as absurd as to have put an
inverted torch into the hand of a real person at the time of his expiring. Besides if this

<PB N="55" REF="287"/>
figure had represented a real dying person would not the other figures, or one of them at
least, have stretched out a hand to support her, to have eased her fall among loose stones,
or to have smoothed her pillow? These circumstances evince that the figure is an
emblem, and therefore could not be a representation of the private history of any par∣ticular
family or event.</P>
<P>The man and woman on each side of the dying figure must be considered as emblems,
both from their similarity of situation and dress to the middle figure, and their being
grouped along with it. These I think are hieroglyphic or Eleusinian emblems of
HUMANKIND, with their backs toward the dying figure of MORTAL LIFE, unwilling to
associate with her, yet turning back their serious and attentive countenances, curious
indeed to behold, yet sorry to contemplate their latter end. These figures bring strongly
to one's mind the Adam and Eve of sacred writ, whom some have supposed to have
been allegorical or hieroglyphic persons of Aegyptian origin, but of more antient date,
amongst whom I think is Dr. Warburton. According to this opinion Adam and Eve
were the names of two hieroglyphic figures representing the early state of mankind;
Abel was the name of an hieroglyphic figure representing the age of pasturage, and Cain
the name of another hieroglyphic symbol representing the age of agriculture, at which
time the uses of iron were discovered. And as the people who cultivated the earth and
built houses would increase in numbers much faster by their greater production of food,
they would readily conquer or destroy the people who were sustained by pasturage, which
was typified by Cain slaying Abel.</P>
<P>2. On the other compartment of this celebrated vase is exhibited an emblem of
immortality, the representation of which was well known to constitute a very principal
part of the shews at the Eleusinian mysteries, as Dr. Warburton has proved by variety
of authority. The habitation of spirits or ghosts after death was supposed by the
antients to be placed beneath the earth, where Pluto reigned, and dispensed rewards or
punishments. Hence the first figure in this group is of the MANES or GHOST, who
having passed through an open portal is descending into a dusky region, pointing his
toe with timid and unsteady step, feeling as it were his way in the gloom. This portal
Aeneas enters, which is described by Virgil,—patet atri janua ditis, Aen. VI. l. 126; as
well as the easy descent,—facilis descensus Averni. Ib. The darkness at the entrance
to the shades is humorously described by Lucian. Div. Legat. Vol. I. p. 241. And the
horror of the gates of hell was in the time of Homer become a proverb; Achilles says
to Ulysses, "I hate a liar worse than the gates of hell;" the same expression is used in
Isaiah, ch. xxxviii. v. 10. The MANES or GHOST appears lingering and fearful, and
wishes to drag after him a part of his mortal garment, which however adheres to the
side of the portal through which he has passed. The beauty of this allegory would have
been expressed by Mr. Pope, by "We feel the ruling passion strong in death."</P>
<P>A little lower down in the group the manes or ghost is received by a beautiful female,
a symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE. This is evinced by her fondling between her knees a
large and playful serpent, which from its annually renewing its external skin has from
great antiquity, even as early as the fable of Prometheus, been esteemed an emblem of
<PB N="56" REF="288"/>
renovated youth. The story of the serpent acquiring immortal life from the ass of
Prometheus, who carried it on his back, is told in Bacon's Works, Vol. V. p. 462.
Quarto edit. Lond. 1778. For a similar purpose a serpent was wrapped round the
large hieroglyphic egg in the temple of Dioscuri, as an emblem of the renewal of life
from a state of death. Bryant's Mythology, Vol II. p. 359. sec. edit. On this account
also the serpent was an attendant on Aesculapius, which seems to have been the name of
the hieroglyphic figure of medicine. This serpent shews this figure to be an emblem,
as the torch shewed the central figure of the other compartment to be an emblem, hence
they agreeably correspond, and explain each other, one representing MORTAL LIFE, and
the other IMMORTAL LIFE.</P>
<P>This emblematic figure of immortal life sits down with her feet towards the figure of
Pluto, but, turning back her face towards the timid ghost, she stretches forth her hand,
and taking hold of his elbow, supports his tottering steps, as well as encourages him to
advance, both which circumstances are thus with wonderful ingenuity brought to the
eye. At the same time the spirit loosely lays his hand upon her arm, as one walking in
the dark would naturally do for the greater certainty of following his conductress, while
the general part of the symbol of IMMORTAL LIFE, being turned toward the figure of
Pluto, shews that she is leading the phantom to his realms.</P>
<P>In the Pamphili gardens at Rome, Perseus in assisting Andromeda to descend from the
rock takes hold of her elbow to steady or support her step, and she lays her hand loosely
on his arm as in this figure. Admir. Roman. Antiq.</P>
<P>The figure of PLUTO can not be mistaken, as is agreed by most of the writers who
have mentioned this vase; his grisley beard, and his having one foot buried in the earth,
denotes the infernal monarch. He is placed at the lowest part of the group, and resting
his chin on his hand, and his arm upon his knee, receives the stranger-spirit with
inquisitive attention; it was before observed that when people think attentively they
naturally rest their bodies in some easy attitude, that more animal power may be employed
on the thinking faculty. In this group of figures there is great art shewn in giving an
idea of a descending plain, viz. from earth to Elysium, and yet all the figures are in
reality on an horizontal one. This wonderful deception is produced first by the descend∣ing
step of the manes or ghost; secondly, by the arm of the sitting figure of immortal life
being raised up to receive him as he descends; and lastly, by Pluto having one foot
sunk into the earth.</P>
<P>There is yet another figure which is concerned in conducting the manes or ghost to
the realms of Pluto, and this is LOVE. He precedes the descending spirit on expanded
wings, lights him with his torch, and turning back his beautiful countenance beckons
him to advance. The antient God of love was of much higher dignity than the modern
Cupid. He was the first that came out of the great egg of night, (Hesiod. Theog.
V. CXX. Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 348.) and is said to possess the keys of the
sky, sea, and earth. As he therefore led the way into this life, he seems to constitute a
proper emblem for leading the way to a suture life. See Bacon's works. Vol. I. p. 568.
and Vol. III. p. 582. Quarto edit.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="289"/>
The introduction of love into this part of the mysteries requires a little further expla∣nation.
The Psyche of the Aegyptians was one of their most favourite emblems, and
represented the soul, or a future life; it was originally no other than the aurelia, or
butterfly, but in after times was represented by a lovely female child with the beautiful
wings of that insect. The aurelia, after its first stage as an eruca or caterpillar, lies for
a season in a manner dead, and is inclosed in a sort of coffin, in this state of darkness it
remains all the winter, but at the return of spring it bursts its bonds and comes out
with new life, and in the most beautiful attire. The Aegyptians thought this a very
proper picture of the soul of man, and of the immortality to which it aspired. But as
this was all owing to divine Love, of which EROS was an emblem, we find this person
frequently introduced as a concomitant of the soul in general or Psyche. (Bryant's
Mythol. Vol. II. p. 386.) EROS, or divine Love, is for the same reason a proper attendant
on the manes or soul after death, and much contributes to tell the story, that is, to
shew that a soul or manes is designed by the descending figure. From this figure of
Love M. D'Hancarville imagines that Orpheus and Eurydice are typified under the
figure of the manes and immortal life as above described. It may be sufficient to answer,
first, that Orpheus is always represented with a lyre, of which there are prints of four
different gems in Spence's Polymetis, and Virgil so describes him, Aen. VI. cytharâ.
fretus. And secondly, that it is absurd to suppose that Eurydice was fondling and
playing with a serpent that had slain her. Add to this that Love seems to have been an
inhabitant of the infernal regions, as exhibited in the mysteries, for Claudian, who
treats more openly of the Eleusinian mysteries, when they were held in less veneration,
invokes the deities to disclose to him their secrets, and amongst other things by what
torch Love softens Pluto.</P>
<Q><L>Dii, quibus in numerum, &amp;c.</L>
<L>Vos mihi sacrarum penetralia pandite rerum,</L>

<P>In this compartment there are two trees, whose branches spread over the figures,
one of them has smoother leaves like some evergreens, and might thence be supposed to
have some allusion to immortality, but they may perhaps have been designed only as
ornaments, or to relieve the figures, or because it was in groves, where these mysteries
were originally celebrated. Thus Homer speaks of the woods of Proserpine, and
mentions many trees in Tartarus, as presenting their fruits to Tantalus; Virgil speaks
of the pleasant groves of Elysium; and in Spence's Polymetis there are prints of two
antient gems, one of Orpheus charming Cerberus with his lyre, and the other of Hercules
binding him in a cord, each of them standing by a tree. Polymet. p. 284. As however
these trees have all different foliage so clearly marked by the artist, they may have had
specific meanings in the exhibitions of the mysteries, which have not reached posterity,
of this kind seem to have been the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the tree of
life, in sacred writ, both which must have been emblematic or allegorical. The masks,
<PB N="58" REF="290"/>
hanging to the handles of the vase, seem to indicate that there is a concealed meaning in
the figures besides their general appearance. And the priestess at the bottom, which I
come now to describe, seems to shew this concealed meaning to be of the sacred or
Eleusinian kind.</P>
<P>3. The figure on the bottom of the vase is on a larger scale than the others, and less
finely finished, and less elevated, and as this bottom part was afterwards cemented to the
upper part, it might be executed by another artist for the sake of expedition, but there
seems no reason to suppose that it was not originally designed for the upper part of it as
some have conjectured. As the mysteries of Ceres were celebrated by female priests, for
Porphyrius says the antients called the priestesses of Ceres, Melissai, or bees, which were
emblems of chastity. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 235. And as, in his Satire against the sex,
Juvenal says, that few women are worthy to be priestesses of Ceres. Sat. VI. the figure
at the bottom of the vase would seem to represent a PRIESTESS or HIEROPHANT, whose
office it was to introduce the initiated, and point out to them, and explain the
exhibitions in the mysteries, and to exclude the uninitiated, calling out to them, " Far,
far retire, ye profane!" and to guard the secrets of the temple. Thus the introductory
hymn sung by the hierophant, according to Eusebius, begins, "I will declare a secret to
the initiated, but let the doors be shut against the profane." Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 177.
The priestess or hierophant appears in this figure with a close hood, and dressed in linen,
which sits close about her; except a light cloak, which flutters in the wind. Wool,
as taken from slaughtered animals, was esteemed profane by the priests of Aegypt, who
were always dressed in linen. Apuleus, p. 64. Div. Leg. Vol. I. p. 318. Thus Eli
made for Samuel a linen ephod. Samuel i. 3.</P>
<P>Secrecy was the foundation on which all mysteries rested, when publicly known they
ceased to be mysteries; hence a discovery of them was not only punished with death by
the Athenian law; but in other countries a disgrace attended the breach of a solemn
oath. The priestess in the figure before us has her finger pointing to her lips as an
emblem of silence. There is a figure of Harpocrates, who was of Aegyptian origin, the
same as Orus, with the lotus on his head, and with his finger pointing to his lips not
pressed upon them, in Bryant's Mythol. Vol. II. p. 398, and another female figure
standing on a lotus, as if just risen from the Nile, with her finger in the same attitude,
these seem to have been representations or emblems of male and female priests of
the secret mysteries. As these sort of emblems were frequently changed by artists for
their more elegant exhibition, it is possible the foliage over the head of this figure may
bear some analogy to the lotus above mentioned.</P>
<P>This figure of secrecy seems to be here placed, with great ingenuity, as a caution to
the initiated, who might understand the meaning of the emblems round the vase, not
to divulge it. And this circumstance seems to account for there being no written ex∣planation
extant, and no tradition concerning these beautiful figures handed down to us
along with them.</P>
<P>Another explanation of this figure at the bottom of the vase would seem to confirm
the idea that the basso relievos round its sides are representations of a part of the

mysteries, I mean that it is the head of ATIS. Lucian says that Atis was a young man
of Phrygia, of uncommon beauty, that he dedicated a temple in Syria to Rhea, or
Cybele, and first taught her mysteries to the Lydians, Phrygians, and Samothracians,
which mysteries he brought from India. He was afterwards made an eunuch by Rhea,
and lived like a woman, and assumed a feminine habit, and in that garb went over the
world teaching her ceremonies and mysteries. Dict. par M. Danet, art. Atis. As this
figure is covered with clothes, while those on the sides of the vase are naked, and has a
Phrygian cap on the head, and as the form and features are so soft, that it is difficult to
say whether it be a male or female figure, there is reason to conclude, 1. that it has
reference to some particular person of some particular country; 2. that this person is
Atis, the first great hierophant, or teacher of mysteries, to whom M. De la Chausse says
the figure itself bears a resemblance. Museo. Capitol. Tom. IV. p. 402.</P>
<P>In the Museum Etruscum, Vol. I. plate 96, there is the head of Atis with feminine
features, clothed with a Phrygian cap, and rising from very broad foliage, placed on a
kind of term supported by the paw of a lion. Goreus in his explanation of the figure
says that it is placed on a lion's foot because that animal was sacred to Cybele, and that
it rises from very broad leaves because after he became an eunuch he determined to
dwell in the groves. Thus the foliage, as well as the cap and feminine features, confirm
the idea of this figure at the bottom of the vase representing the head of Atis the first
great hierophant, and that the figures on the sides of the vase are emblems from the
antient mysteries.</P>
<P>I beg leave to add that it does not appear to have been uncommon amongst the
antients to put allegorical figures on funeral vases. In the Pamphili palace at Rome
there is an elaborate representation of Life and of Death, on an antient sarcophagus. In
the first Prometheus is represented making man, and Minerva is placing a butterfly, or
the foul, upon his head. In the other compartment Love extinguishes his torch in the
bosom of the dying figure, and is receiving the butterfly, or Psyche, from him, with a
great number of complicated emblematic figures grouped in very bad taste. Admir.

<HEAD>NOTE XXIII.—COAL.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Whence sable Coal his massy couch extends,</L>
<L>And stars of gold the sparkling Pyrite blends. </L><BIBL>CANTO II. l. 349.</BIBL></Q>
<P>TO elucidate the formation of coal-beds I shall here describe a fountain of fossil tar,
or petroleum, discovered lately near Colebrook Dale in Shropshire, the particulars of
which were sent me by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrewsbury.</P>
<P>About a mile and a half below the celebrated iron-bridge, constructed by the late
Mr. DARBY near Colebrook Dale, on the east side of the river Severn, as the workmen
in October 1786 were making a subterranean canal into the mountain, for the more
easy acquisition and conveyance of the coals which lie under it, they found an oozing of
liquid bitumen, or petroleum; and as they proceeded further cut through small cavities
of different sizes from which the bitumen issued. From ten to fifteen barrels of this
fossil tar, each barrel containing thirty-two gallons, were at first collected in a day,
which has since however gradually diminished in quantity, so that at present the product
is about seven barrels in fourteen days.</P>
<P>The mountain, into which this canal enters, consists of siliceous sand, in which
however a few marine productions, apparently in their recent state, have been found,
and are now in the possession of Mr. WILLIAM REYNOLDS of Ketly Bank. About
three hundred yards from the entrance into the mountain, and about twenty-eight yards
below the surface of it, the tar is found oozing from the sand-rock above into the top
and sides of the canal.</P>
<P>Beneath the level of this canal a shaft has been sunk through a grey argillaceous
substance, called in this country clunch, which is said to be a pretty certain indication
of coal; beneath this lies a stratum of coal, about two or three inches thick, of an
inferior kind, yielding little flame in burning, and leaving much ashes; below this is a
rock of a harder texture; and beneath this are found coals of an excellent quality; for
the purpose of procuring which with greater facility the canal, or horizontal aperture, is
now making into the mountain. July, 1788.</P>
<P>Beneath these coals in some places is found salt water, in other parts of the adjacent
country there are beds of iron-stone, which also contain some bitumen in a less fluid
state, and which are about on a level with the new canal, into which the fossil tar oozes,
as above described.</P>
<P>There are many interesting circumstances attending the situation and accompaniments
of this fountain of fossil tar, tending to develop the manner of its production. 1. As the
canal passing into the mountain runs over the beds of coals, and under the reservoir
of petroleum, it appears that a <HI>natural distillation</HI> of this fossil in the bowels of the earth
must have taken place at some early period of the world, similar to the artificial distillation
<PB N="61" REF="294"/>
of coal, which has many years been carried on in this place on a smaller scale above
ground. When this reservoir of petroleum was cut into, the slowness of its exsudation
into the canal was not only owing to its viscidity, but to the pressure of the atmosphere,
or to the necessity there was that air should at the same time insinuate itself into the small
cavities from which the petroleum descended. The existence of such a distillation at
some antient time is confirmed by the thin stratum of coal beneath the canal, (which
covers the hard rock,) having been deprived of its fossil oil, so as to burn without flame,
and thus to have become a natural coak, or fossil charcoal, while the petroleum distilled
from it is found in the cavities of the rock above it.</P>
<P>There are appearances in other places, which favour this idea of the natural distillation
of petroleum, thus at Matlock in Derbyshire a hard bitumen is found adhering to the
spar in the clefts of the lime-rocks in the form of round drops about the size of peas;
which could perhaps only be deposited there in that form by sublimation.</P>
<P>2. The second deduction, which offers itself, is, that these beds of coal have been
<HI>exposed to a considerable degree of heat,</HI> since the petroleum above could not be separated,
as far as we know, by any other means, and that the good quality of the coals beneath
the hard rock was owing to the impermeability of this rock to the bituminous vapour,
and to its pressure being too great to permit its being removed by the elasticity of that
vapour. Thus from the degree of heat, the degree of pressure, and the permeability of
the superincumbent strata, many of the phenomena attending coal-beds receive an easy
explanation, which much accords with the ingenious theory of the earth by Dr. Hutton.
Trans. of Edinb. Vol. I.</P>
<P>In some coal works the fusion of the strata of coal has been so slight, that there
remains the appearance of ligneus fibres, and the impression of leaves, as at Bovey near
Exeter, and even seeds of vegetables, of which I have had specimens from the collieries
near Polesworth in Warwickshire. In some, where the heat was not very intense and
the incumbent stratum not permeable to vapour, the fossil oil has only risen to the
upper part of the coal-bed, and has rendered that much more inflammable than the
lower parts of it, as in the collieries near Beaudesert, the seat of the EARL OF UXBRIDGE
in Staffordshire, where the upper stratum is a perfect cannel, or candle-coal, and the
lower one of an inferior quality. Over the coal-beds near Sir H. HARPUR's house in
Derbyshire a thin lamina of asphaltum is found in some places near the surface of the
earth, which would seem to be from a distillation of petroleum from the coals below,
the more fluid part of which had in process of time exhaled, or been consolidated by its
absorption of air. In other coal-works the upper part of the stratum is of a worse kind
than the lower one, as at Alfreton and Denbigh in Derbyshire, owing to the super∣cumbent
stratum having permitted the exhalation of a great part of the petroleum;
whilst at Widdrington in Northumberland there is first a seam of coal about six inches
thick of no value, which lies under about four fathom of clay, beneath this is a white
freestone, then a hard stone, which the workmen there call a whin, then two fathoms
of clay, then another white stone, and under that a vein of coals three feet nine inches
<PB N="62" REF="295"/>
thick, of a similar nature to the Newcastle coal. Phil. Trans. Abridg. Vol. VI. plate II.
p. 192. The similitude between the circumstances of this colliery, and of the coal
beneath the fountain of tar above described, renders it highly probable that this upper
thin seam of coal has suffered a similar distillation, and that the inflammable part of it
had either been received into the clay above in the form of sulphur, which when burnt
in the open air would produce alum; or had been dissipated for want of a receiver,
where it could be condensed. The former opinion is perhaps in this cafe more probable
as in some other coal-beds, of which I have procured accounts, the surface of the coal
beneath clunch or clay is of an inferior quality, as at West Hallum in Nottinghamshire.
The clunch probably from hence acquires its inflammable part, which on calcination
becomes vitriolic acid. I gathered pieces of clunch converted partially into alum at a
colliery near Bilston, where the ground was still on fire a few years ago.</P>
<P>The heat, which has thus pervaded the beds of morass, seems to have been the
effect of the fermentation of their vegetable materials; as new hay sometimes takes fire
even in such very small masses from the sugar it contains, and seems hence not to have
been attended with any expulsion of lava, like the deeper craters of volcanos situated in
beds of granite.</P>
<P>3. The marine shells found in the loose sand-rock above this reservoir of petroleum,
and the coal-beds beneath it, together with the existence of sea-salt beneath these coals,
prove that these coal beds have been <HI>at the bottom of the sea,</HI> during some remote period
of time, and were afterwards raised into their present situation by subterraneous expan∣sions
of vapour. This doctrine is further supported by the marks of violence, which
some coal-beds received at the time they were raised out of the sea, as in the collieries at
Mendip in Somersetshire. In these there are seven strata of coals, equitant upon each
other, with beds of clay and stone intervening; amongst which clay are found shells and
fern branches. In one part of this hill the strata are disjoined, and a quantity of
heterogeneous substances fill up the chasm which disjoins them, on one side of this
chasm the seven strata of coal are seen corresponding in respect to their reciprocal thick∣ness
and goodness with the seven strata on the other side of the cavity, except that they
have been elevated several yards higher. Phil. Trans. No. 360. abridg. Vol. V. p. 237.</P>
<P>The cracks in the coal-bed near Ticknall in Derbyshire, and in the sand-stone rock
over it, in both of which specimens of lead-ore and spar are found, confirm this opinion
of their having been forcibly raised up by subterraneous fires. Over the colliery at
Brown-hills near Lichfield, there is a stratum of gravel on the surface of the ground;
which may be adduced as another proof to shew that those coals had some time been
beneath the sea, or the bed of a river. Nevertheless, these arguments only apply to the
collieries above mentioned, which are few compared with those which bear no marks of
having been immersed in the sea.</P>
<P>On the other hand the production of coals from morasses, as described in note XX.
is evinced from the vegetable matters frequently found in them, and in the strata over
them; as fern-leaves in nodules of iron-ore, and from the bog-shells or fresh water
<PB N="63" REF="296"/>
muscles sometimes found over them, of both which I have what I believe to be speci∣mens;
and is further proved from some parts of these beds being only in part trans∣formed
to coal; and the other part still retaining not only the form, but some of the
properties of wood; specimens of which are not unfrequent in the cabinets of the curious,
procured from Loch Neigh in Ireland, from Bovey near Exeter, and other places; and
from a famous cavern called the Temple of the Devil, near the town of Altorf in Fran∣conia,
at the foot of a mountain covered with pine and savine, in which are found large
coals resembling trees of ebony; which are so far mineralized as to be heavy and com∣pact;
and so to effloresce with pyrites in some parts as to crumble to pieces; yet from
other parts white ashes are produced on calcination, from which <HI>fixed alcali</HI> is procured;
which evinces their vegetable origin. (Dict. Raisonné, art. Charbon.) To these may
be added another argument from the oil which is distilled from coals, and which is
analogous to vegetable oil, and does not exist in any bodies truly mineral. Keir's
Chemical Dictionary, art. Bitumen.</P>
<P>Whence it would appear, that though most collieries with their attendant strata
of clay, sand-stone, and iron, were formed on the places where the vegetables grew,
from which they had their origin; yet that other collections of vegetable matter were
washed down from eminences by currents of waters into the beds of rivers, or the
neighbouring seas, and were there accumulated at different periods of time, and under∣went
a great degree of heat from their fermentation, in the same manner as those beds
of morass which had continued on the plains where they were produced. And that by
this fermentation many of them had been raised from the ocean with sand and sea-shells
over them; and others from the beds of rivers with accumulations of gravel upon them.</P>
<P>4. For the purpose of bringing this history of the products of morasses more distinctly
to the eye of the reader, I shall here subjoin two or three accounts of sinking or boring

As these strata generally lie inclined, I suppose parallel with the limestone on which
they rest, the upper edges of them all come out to day, which is termed bassetting;
when the whole mass was ignited by its fermentation, it is probable that the inflam∣mable
part of some strata might thus more easily escape than of others in the form of
vapour; as dews are known to slide between such strata in the production of springs;
which accounts for some coal-beds being so much worse than others. See note XX.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXIV.—GRANITE.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Climb the rude steeps, the Granite-cliffs surround.</L> <BIBL>CANTO II. l. 522.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE lowest stratum of the earth which human labour has arrived to, is granite;
and of this likewise consists the highest mountains of the world. It is known under
variety of names according to some difference in its appearance or composition, but is
now generally considered by philosophers as a species of lava; if it contains quartz, felt∣spat,
and mica in distinct crystals, it is called granite; which is found in Cornwall in
rocks; and in loose stones in the gravel near Drayton in Shropshire, in the road towards
Newcastle. If these parts of the composition be less distinct, or if only two of them be
visible to the eye, it is termed porphyry, trap, whinstone, moorstone, slate. And if it
appears in a regular angular form, it is called basaltes. The affinity of these bodies has
lately been further well established by Dr. Beddoes in the Phil. Trans. Vol. LXXX.</P>
<P>These are all esteemed to have been volcanic productions that have undergone different
degrees of heat; it is well known that in Papin's digester water may be made red hot by
confinement, and will then dissolve many bodies which otherwise are little or not at all
acted upon by it. From hence it may be conceived, that under immense pressure of
superincumbent materials, and by great heat, these masses of lava may have undergone
a kind of aqueous solution, without any tendency to vitrification, and might thence have
a power of crystallization, whence all the varieties above mentioned from the different
proportion of the materials, or the different degrees of heat they may have undergone in
this aqueous solution. And that the uniformity of the mixture of the original earths,
as of lime, argil, silex, magnesia, and barytes, which they contain, was owing to their
boiling together a longer or shorter time before their elevation into mountains. See
note XIX. art. 8.</P>
<P>The seat of volcanos seems to be principally, if not entirely, in these strata of granite;
as many of them are situated on granite mountains, and throw up from time to time
sheets of lava which run down over the preceeding strata from the same origin; and in
this they seem to differ from the heat which has separated the clay, coal, and sand in
morasses, which would appear to have risen from a kind of fermentation, and thus to
have pervaded the whole mass without any expuition of lava.</P>

<P><PB N="65" REF="299"/>
All the lavas from Vesuvius contain one fourth part of iron, (Kirwan's Min.) and
all the five primitive earths, viz. calcareous, argillaceous, siliceous, barytic, and magnesian
earths, which are also evidently produced now daily from the recrements of animal and
vegetable bodies. What is to be thence concluded? Has the granite stratum in very
antient times been produced like the present calcareous and siliceous masses, according
to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton, who says new continents are now forming at the
bottom of the sea to rise in their turn, and that thus the terraqueous globe has been,
and will be, eternal? Or shall we suppose that this internal heated mass of granite,
which forms the nucleus of the earth, was a part of the body of the sun before it was
separated by an explosion? Or was the fun originally a planet, inhabited like ours, and a
satellite to some other greater fun, which has long been extinguished by diffusion of its
light, and around which the present sun continues to revolve, according to a conjecture
of the celebrated Mr. Herschell, and which conveys to the mind a most sublime idea
of the progressive and increasing excellence of the works of the Creator of all things?</P>
<P>For the more easy comprehension of the facts and conjectures concerning the situation
and production of the various strata of the earth, I shall here subjoin a supposed section
of the globe, but without any attempt to give the proportions of the parts, or the
number of them, but only their respective situation over each other, and a geological
recapitulation.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>GEOLOGICAL RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>1. The earth was projected along with the other primary planets from the sun,
which is supposed to be on fire only on its surface, emitting light without much internal
heat like a ball of burning camphor.</P>
<P>2. The rotation of the earth round its axis was occasioned by its greater friction or
adhesion to one side of the cavity from which it was ejected; and from this rotation it
acquired its spheroidical form. As it cooled in its ascent from the sun its nucleus
became harder; and its attendant vapours were condensed, forming the ocean.</P>
<P>3. The masses or mountains of granite, porphery, basalt, and stones of similar structure,
were a part of the original nucleus of the earth; or consist of volcanic productions
since formed.</P>
<P>4. On this nucleus of granite and basaltes, thus covered by the ocean, were formed
the calcareous beds of limestone, marble, chalk, spar, from the exuviae of marine animals;
with the flints, or chertz, which accompany them. And were stratified by their having
been formed at different and very distant periods of time.</P>
<P>5. The whole terraqueous globe was burst by central fires; islands and continents
were raised, consisting of granite or lava in some parts, and of limestone in others; and
great vallies were sunk, into which the ocean retired.</P>
<P>6. During these central earthquakes the moon was ejected from the earth, causing
new tides; and the earth's axis suffered some change in its inclination, and its rotatory
motion was retarded.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="300"/>
7. On some parts of these islands and continents of granite or limestone were
gradually produced extensive morasses from the recrements of vegetables and of land
animals; and from these morasses, heated by fermentation, were produced clay, marle,
sandstone, coal, iron, (with the bases of variety of acids;) all which were stratified by
their having been formed at different, and very distant periods of time.</P>
<P>8. In the elevation of the mountains very numerous and deep fissures necessarily
were produced. In these fissures many of the metals are formed partly from descending
materials, and partly from ascending ones raised in vapour by subterraneous fires. In
the fissures of granite or porphery quartz is formed; in the fissures of limestone
calcareous spar is produced.</P>
<P>9. During these first great volcanic fires it is probable the atmosphere was either
produced, or much increased; a process which is perhaps now going on in the moon;
Mr. Herschell having discovered a volcanic crater three miles broad burning on her disk.</P>
<P>10. The summits of the new mountains were cracked into innumerable lozenges
by the cold dews or snows falling upon them when red hot. From these summits,
which were then twice as high as at present, cubes and lozenges of granite, and basalt,
and quartz in some countries, and of marble and flints in others, descended gradually
into the valleys, and were rolled together in the beds of rivers, (which were then so large
as to occupy the whole valleys, which they now only intersect;) and produced the
great beds of gravel, of which many valleys consist.</P>
<P>11. In several parts of the earth's surface subsequent earthquakes, from the fermen∣tation
of morasses, have at different periods of time deranged the position of the matters
above described. Hence the gravel, which was before in the beds of rivers, has in
some places been raised into mountains, along with clay and coal strata which were
formed from morasses and washed down from eminences into the beds of rivers or the
neighbouring seas, and in part raised again with gravel or marine shells over them;
but this has only obtained in few places compared with the general distribution of
such materials. Hence there seem to have existed two sources of earthquakes, which
have occurred at great distance of time from each other; one from the granite beds in
the central parts of the earth, and the other from the morasses on its surface. All the
subsequent earthquakes and volcanos of modern days compared with these are of small
extent and insignificant effect.</P>
<P>12. Besides the argillaceous sand-stone produced from morasses, which is stratified
with clay, and coal, and iron, other great beds of siliceous sand have been formed in the
sea by the combination of an unknown acid from morasses, and the calcareous matters
of the ocean.</P>
<P>13. The warm waters which are found in many countries, are owing to steam
arising from great depths through the fissures of limestone or lava, elevated by sub∣terranean
fires, and condensed between the strata of the hills over them; and not from
any decomposition of pyrites or manganese near the surface of the earth.</P>
<P>14. The columns of basaltes have been raised by the congelation or expansion of
granite beds in the act of cooling from their semi-vitreous fusion.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXV.—EVAPORATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Aquatic nymphs! you lead with viewless march</L>
<L>The winged vapour up the aerial arch. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 13.</BIBL></Q>
<P>1. THE atmosphere will dissolve a certain quantity of moisture as a chemical men∣struum,
even when it is much below the freezing point, as appears from the diminution
of ice suspended in frosty air, but a much greater quantity of water is evaporated and
suspended in the air by means of heat, which is perhaps the universal cause of fluidity,
for water is known to boil with less heat in vacuo, which is a proof that it will evaporate
faster in vacuo, and that the air therefore rather hinders than promotes its evaporation
in higher degrees of heat. The quick evaporation occasioned in vacuo by a small degree
of heat is agreeably seen in what is termed a pulse-glass, which consists of an exhausted
tube of glass with a bulb at each end of it and with about two thirds of the cavity filled
with alcohol, in which the spirit is instantly seen to boil by the heat of the finger-end
applied on a bubble of steam in the lower bulb, and is condensed again in the upper
bulb by the least conceivable comparative coldness.</P>
<P>2. Another circumstance evincing that heat is the principal cause of evaporation is
that at the time of water being converted into steam, a great quantity of heat is taken
away from the neighbouring bodies. If a thermometer be repeatedly dipped in ether, or
in rectified spirit of wine, and exposed to a blast of air, to expedite the evaporation by
perpetually removing the saturated air from it, the thermometer will presently sink below
freezing. This warmth, taken from the ambient bodies at the time of evaporation by
the steam, is again given out when the steam is condensed into water. Hence the water
in a worm-tub during distillation so soon becomes hot; and hence the warmth ac∣companying
the descent of rain in cold weather.</P>
<P>3. The third circumstance, shewing that heat is the principal cause of evaporation, is,
that some of the steam becomes again condensed when any part of the heat is withdrawn.
Thus when warmer south-west winds replete with moisture succeed the colder north∣east
winds all bodies that are dense and substantial, as stone walls, brick floors, &amp;c. absorb
some of the heat from the passing air, and its moisture becomes precipitated on them,
while the north-east winds become warmer on their arrival in this latitude, and are
thence disposed to take up more moisture, and are termed drying winds.</P>
<P>4. Heat seems to be the principal cause of the solution of many other bodies, as
common salt, or blue vitriol dissolved in water, which when exposed to severe cold are
precipitated, or carried, to the part of the water last frozen; this I observed in a phial
filled with a solution of blue vitriol which was frozen; the phial was burst, the ice
<PB N="68" REF="302"/>
thawed, and a blue column of cupreous vitriol was left standing upright on the bottom
of the broken glass, as described in note XIX.</P>
<P>II. Hence water may either be dissolved in air, and may then be called an aerial
solution of water; or it may be dissolved in the fluid matter of heat, according to the
theory of M. Lavoisier, and may then be called steam. In the former case it is probable
there are many other vapours which may precipitate it, as marine acid gas, or fluor acid
gas. So alcaline gas and acid gas dissolved in air precipitate each other, nitrous gas pre∣cipitates
vital air from its azote, and inflammable gas mixed with vital air ignited by an
electric spark either produces or precipitates the water in both of them. Are there any
subtle exhalations occasionally diffused in the atmosphere which may thus cause rain?</P>
<P>1. But as water is perhaps many hundred times more soluble in the fluid matter of
heat than in air, I suppose the education of this heat, by whatever means it is occasioned,
is the principal cause of devaporation. Thus if a region of air is brought from a
warmer climate, as the S. W. winds, it becomes cooled by its contact with the earth in
this latitude, and parts with so much of its moisture as was dissolved in the quantity of
calorique, or heat, which it now looses, but retains that part which was suspended by its
attraction to the particles of air, or by aerial solution, even in the most severe frosts.</P>
<P>2. A second immediate cause of rain is a stream of N. E. wind descending from a
superior current of air, and mixing with the warmer S. W. wind below; or the reverse
of this, viz. a superior current of S. W. wind mixing with an inferior one of N. E.
wind; in both these cases the whole heaven becomes instantly clouded, and the moisture
contained in the S. W. current is precipitated. This cause of devaporation has been
ingeniously explained by Dr. Hutton in the Transact. of Edinburgh, Vol. I. and seems
to arise from this circumstance; the particles of air of the N. E. wind educe part of
the heat from the S. W. wind, and therefore the water which was dissolved by that
quantity of <HI>heat</HI> is precipitated; all the other part of the water, which was suspended
by its attraction to the particles of air, or dissolved in the remainder of the heat, continues unprecipitated.</P>
<P>3. A third method by which a region of air becomes cooled, and in consequence
deposits much of its moisture, is from the mechanical expansion of air, when part of the
pressure is taken off. In this case the expanded air becomes capable of receiving or
attracting more of the matter of heat into its interstices, and the vapour, which was
previously dissolved in this heat, is deposited, as is seen in the receiver of an air-pump,
which becomes dewy, as the air within becomes expanded by the education of part of it.
See note VII. Hence when the mercury in the barometer sinks without a change of
the wind the air generally becomes colder. See note VII. on Elementary Heat. And it
is probably from the varying pressure of the incumbent air that in summer days small
black clouds are often thus suddenly produced, and again soon vanish. See a paper in
Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVIII. intitled Frigorific Experiments on the Mechanical Ex∣pansion
of Air.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="303"/>
4. Another portion of atmospheric water may possibly be held in solution by the
electric fluid, since in thunder storms a precipitation of the water seems to be either the
cause or the consequence of the eduction of the electricity. But it appears more pro∣bable
that the water is condensed into clouds by the eduction of its heat, and that then
the surplus of electricity prevents their coalescence into larger drops, which immediately
succeeds the departure of the lightning.</P>
<P>5. The immediate cause why the barometer sinks before rain is, first, because a region
of warm air, brought to us in the place of the cold air which it had displaced, must
weigh lighter, both specifically and absolutely, if the height of the warm atmosphere be
supposed to be equal to that or the preceeding cold one. And secondly, after the drops
of rain begin to fall in any column of air, that column becomes lighter, the falling drops
only adding to the prssure of the air in proportion to the resistance which they meet
with in passing through that fluid.</P>
<P>If we could suppose water to be dissolved in air without heat, or in very low degrees
of heat, I suppose the air would become heavier, as happens in many chemical solution,
but if water dissolved in the matter of heat, or calorique, be mixed with an aerial solutions,
of water, there can be no doubt but an atmosphere consisting of such a mixture must
become lighter in proportion to the quantity of calorique. On the same circumstance
depends the visible vapour produced from the breath of animals in cold weather, or
from a boiling kettle; the particles of cold air, with which it is mixed, steal a part
of its heat, and become themselves raised in temperature, whence part of the water
is precipitated in visible vapour, which, if in great quantity sinks to the ground; if in
small quantity, and the surrounding air is not previously saturated, it spreads itself till it
becomes again dissolved.</P>

<Q><L>Your lucid bands condense with fingers chill</L>
<L>The blue mist hovering round the gelid hill. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 19.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE surface of the earth consists of strata many of which were formed originally
beneath the sea, the mountains were afterwards forced up by subterraneous fires, as
appears from the fillures in the rocks of which they consist the quantity of volcanic
productions all over the world, and the numerous remains of craters of volcanos in
mountainous countries. Hence the strata which compose the sides of mountains lie
slanting downwards, and one or two or more of the external strata not reaching to the
summit when the mountain was raised up, the second or third stratum or a more inferior
one is there exposed to day; this may be well represented by forceably thrusting a
blunt instrument through several sheets of paper, a bur will stand up with the lowermost
sheet standing highest in the center of it. On this uppermost stratum, which is colder as
it is more elevated, the dews are condensed in large quantities; and sliding down pass
under the first or second or third stratum which compose the sides of the hill; and either
form a morass below, or a weeping rock, by oozing out in numerous places, or many
of these less currents meeting together burst out in a more copious rill.</P>
<P>The summits of mountains are much colder than the plains in their vicinity, owing
to several causes; 1. Their being in a manner insulated or cut off from the common
heat of the earth, which is always of 48 degrees, and perpetually counteracts the effects
of external cold beneath that degree. 2. From their surfaces being larger in proportion
to their solid contents, and hence their heat more expeditiously carried away by the
ever-moving atmosphere. 3. The increasing rarity of the air as the mountain rises.
All those bodies which conduct electricity well or ill, conduct the matter of heat likewise
well or ill. See note VII. Atmospheric air is a bad conductor of electricity and thence
confines it on the body where it is accumulated, but when it is made very rare, as in the
exhausted receiver, the electric aura passes away immediately to any distance. The
same circumstance probably happens in respect to heat, which is thus kept by the denser
air on the plains from escaping, but is dissipated on the hills where the air is thinner.
4. As the currents of air rise up the sides of mountains they become mechanically
rarefied, the pressure of the incumbent column lessening as they ascend. Hence the
expanding air absorbs heat from the mountain as it ascends, as explained in note VII.
5. There is another, and perhaps more powerful cause, I suspect, which may occasion
the great cold on mountains, and in the higher parts of the atmosphere, and which has
not yet been attended to; I mean that the fluid matter of heat may prodably gravitate
round the earth, and form an atmosphere on its surface, mixed with the aerial atmosphere,
which may diminish or become rarer, as it recedes from the earth's surface, in a greater
proportion than the air diminishes.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="305"/>
6. The great condensation of moisture on the summits of hills has another cause,
which is the dashing of moving clouds against them, in misty days this is often seen
to have great effect on plains, where an eminent tree by obstructing the mist as it
moves along shall have a much greater quantity of moisture drop from its leaves than
falls at the same time on the ground in its vicinity. Mr. White, in his History of
Selborne gives an account of a large tree so situated, from which a stream flowed during
a moving mist so as to fill the cart-ruts in a lane otherwise not very moist, and ingeniously
adds, that trees planted about ponds of stagnant water contribute much by these means
to supply the reservoir. The spherules which constitute a mist or cloud are kept from
uniting by so small a power that a little agitation against the leaves of a tree, or the
greater attraction of a flat moist surface, condenses or precipitates them.</P>
<P>If a leaf has its surface moistened and particles of water separate from each other
as in a mist be brought near the moistened surface of a leaf, each particle will be attracted
more by that plain surface of water on the leaf than it can be by the surrounding
particles of the mist, because globules only attract each other in one point, whereas a
plain attracts a globule by a greater extent of its surface.</P>
<P>The common cold springs are thus formed on elevated grounds by the condensed
vapours, and hence are stronger when the nights are cold after hot days in spring, than
even in the wet days of winter. For the warm atmosphere during the day has dissolved
much more water than it can support in solution during the cold of the night, which is
thus deposited in large quantities on the hills, and yet so gradually as to soak in between
the strata of them, rather than to slide off over their surfaces like showers of rain.
The common heat of the internal parts of the earth is ascertained by springs which
arise from strata of earth too deep to be affected by the heat of summer or the frosts of
winter. Those in this country are of 48 degrees of heat, those about Philidelphia were said
by Dr. Franklin to be 52; whether this variation is to be accounted for by the difference
of the sun's heat on that country, according to the ingenious theory of Mr. Kirwan, or to
the vicinity of subterranean fires is not yet, I think, decided. There are however sub∣terraneous
streams of water not exactly produced in this manner, as streams issuing from
fissures in the earth, communicating with the craters of old volcanoes; in the Peak of
Derbyshire are many hollows, called swallows, where the land floods sink into the
earth, and come out at some miles distant, as at Ilam near Ashborne. See note on
Fica, Vol. II.</P>
<P>Other streams of cold water arise from beneath the snow on the Alps and Andes,
and other high mountains, which is perpetualy thawing at its under surface by the
common heat of the earth, and gives rise to large rivers. For the origin of warm springs
see note on Fucus, Vol. II.</P>

<P>THE armour of the Echinus, or Sea-hedge Hog, consists generally of moveable
spines; (<HI>Linnei System.</HI> Nat. Vol. I. p. 1102.) and in that respect resembles the armour
of the land animal of the same name. The irregular protuberances on other sea-shells,
as on some species of the Purpura, and Murex, serve them as a fortification against the
attacks of their enemies.</P>
<P>It is said that this animal foresees tempestuous weather, and sinking to the bottom of
the sea adheres firmly to sea-plants, or other bodies by means of a substance which
resembles the horns of snails. Above twelve hundred of these fillets have been counted
by which this animal fixes itself; and when afloat, it contracts these fillets between the
bases of its points, the number of which often amounts to two thousand. Dict. raisonne.
art. Oursin. de mer.</P>
<P>There is a kind of Nautilus, called by Linneus, Argonauta, whose shell has but one
cell; of this animal Pliny affirms, that having exonerated its shell by throwing out the
water, it swims upon the surface, extending a web of wonderful tenuity, and bending back
two of its arms and rowing with the rest, makes a sail, and at length receiving the water
dives again. Plin. IX. 29. Linneus adds to his description of this animal, that like the
the Crab Diogenes or Bernhard, it occupies a house not its own, as it is not connected
to its shell, and is therefore foreign to it; who could have given credit to this if it had
not been attested by so many who have with their own eyes seen this argonaut in the
act of sailing? Syst. Nat. p. 1161.</P>
<P>The Nautilus, properly so named by Linneus, has a shell consisting of many cham∣bers,
of which cups are made in the East with beautiful painting and carving on the
mother-pearl. The animal is said to inhabit only the uppermost or open chamber, which
is larger than the rest; and that the rest remain empty except that the pipe, or siphun∣culus,
which communicates from one to the other of them is filled with an appendage of
the animal like a gut or string. Mr. Hook in his Philos. Exper. p. 306, imagines this to
be a dilatable or compressible tube, like the air-bladders of fish, and that by contracting
or permitting it to expand, it renders its shell boyant or the contrary. See Note on Ulva,
Vol. II.</P>
<P>The Pinna, or Sea-wing, is contained in a two-valve shell, weighing sometimes fifteen
pounds, and emits a beard of fine long glossy silk-like fibres, by which it is suspended to
the rocks twenty or thirty feet beneath the surface of the sea. In this situation it is so
successfully attacked by the eight-footed Polypus, that the species perhaps could not exist
<PB N="73" REF="307"/>
but for the exertions of the Cancer Pinnotheris, who lives in the same shell as a guard
and companion. Amoen. Academ. Vol. II. p. 48. Lin. Syst. Nat. Vol. I. p. 1159, and
p. 1040.</P>
<P>The Pinnotheris, or Pinnophylax, is a small crab naked like Bernard the Hermit, but
is furnished with good eyes, and lives in the same shell with the Pinna; when they want
food the Pinna opens its shell, and sends its faithful ally to forage; but if the Cancer
sees the Polypus, he returns suddenly to the arms of his blind hostesss, who by closing the
shell avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwise, when it has procured a booty, it brings it
to the opening of the shell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey. This was
observed by Haslequist in his voyage to Palestine.</P>
<P>The Byssus of the antients, according to Aristotle, was the beard of the Pinna above
mentioned, but seems to have been used by other writers indiscriminately for any spun
material, which was esteemed finer or more valuable than wool. Reaumur says the
threads of this Byssus are not less fine or less beautiful than the silk, as it is spun by the
silk-worm; the Pinna on the coasts of Italy and Provence (where it is fished up by iron∣hooks
fixed on long poles) is called the silk-worm of the sea. The stockings and gloves
manufactured from it, are of exquisite fineness, but too warm for common wear, and are
thence esteemed useful in rhumatism and gout. Dict. Raisonné art. Pinne-marine. The
warmth of the Byssus, like that of silk, is probably owing to their being bad conductors
of heat, as well as of electricity. When these fibres are broken by violence, this animal
as well as the muscle has the power to reproduce them like the common spiders, as was
observed by M. Adanson. As raw silk, and raw cobwebs, when swallowed, are liable to
produce great sickness (as I am informed) it is probable the part of muscles, which
sometimes disagrees with the people who eat them, may be this silky web, by which
they attach themselves to stones. The large kind of Pinna contains some mother-pearl
of a reddish tinge, according to M. d'Argenville. The substance sold under the name
of Indian weed, and used at the bottom of fish-lines, is probably a production of this
kind, which however is scarcely to be distinguished by the eye from the tendons of a
rat's tail, after they have been separated by putrefaction in water, and well cleaned and
rubbed; a production, which I was once shewn as a great curiosity; it had the upper∣most
bone of the tail adhering to it, and was said to have been used as an ornament
in a lady's hair.</P>

<P>THE Sturgeon, <HI>Acipenser, Strurio.</HI> Lin. Syst. Nat. Vol. I. p. 403. is a fish of great cu∣riosity
as well as of great importance; his mouth is placed under the head, without teeth,
like the opening of a purse, which he has the power to push suddenly out or retract.
Before this mouth under the beak or nose hang four tendrils some inches long, and which
so resemble earth-worms that at first sight they may be mistaken for them. This clumsy
toothless fish is supposed by this contrivance to keep himself in good condition, the
solidity of his flesh evidently shewing him to be a fish of prey. He is said to hide his
large body amongst the weeds near the sea-coast, or at the mouths of large rivers, only
exposing his cirrhi or tendrils, which small fish or sea-insects mistaking for real worms
approach for plunder, and are sucked into the jaws of their enemy. He has been sup∣posed
by some to root into the soil at the bottom of the sea or rivers; but the cirrhi, or
tendrills abovementioned, which hang from his snout over his mouth, must themselves
be very inconvenient for this purpose, and as it has no jaws it evidently lives by suction,
and during its residence in the sea a quantity of sea-insects are found in its stomach.</P>
<P>The flesh was so valued in the time of the Emperor Severus, that it was brought to
table by servants with coronets on their heads, and preceded by music, which might give
rise to its being in our country presented by the Lord Mayor to the King. At present it
is caught in the Danube, and the Walga, the Don, and other large rivers for various pur∣poses.
The skin makes the best covering for carriages; isinglass is prepared from parts

<HEAD>NOTE XXIX.—OIL ON WATER.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Who with fine films, suspended o'er the deep,</L>
<L>Of Oil effusive lull the waves to sleep. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 87.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THERE is reason to believe that when oil is poured upon water, the two surfaces
do not touch each other, but that the oil is suspended over the water by their mutual
repulsion. This seems to be rendered probable by the following experiment: if one
drop of oil be droped on a bason of water, it will immediately diffuse itself over the whole,
for there being no friction between the two surfaces, there is nothing to prevent its
spreading itself by the gravity of the upper part of it, except its own tenacity, into a pellicle
<PB N="75" REF="309"/>
of the greatest tenuity. But if a second drop of oil be put upon the former, it does not
spread itself, but remains in the form of a drop, as the other already occupied the whole
surface of the bason, and there is friction in oil passing over oil, though none in oil
passing over water.</P>
<P>Hence when oil is diffused on the surface of water gentle breezes have no influence in
raising waves upon it; for a small quantity of oil will cover a very great surface of water,
(I suppose a spoonful will diffuse itself over some acres) and the wind blowing upon this
carries it gradually forwards; and there being no friction between the two surfaces the
water is not affected. On which account oil has no effect in stilling the agitation of the
water after the wind ceases, as was found by the experiments of Dr. Franklin.</P>
<P>This circumstance lately brought into notice by Dr. Franklin had been mentioned by
Pliny, and is said to be in use by the divers for pearls, who in windy weather taken down
with them a little oil in their mouths, which they occasionally give out when the in∣equality
of the supernatant waves prevents them from seeing sufficiently distinctly for their
purpose.</P>
<P>The wonderful tenuity with which oil can be spread upon water is evinced by a
few drops projected from a bridge, where the eye is properly placed over it, passing
through all the prismatic colours as it diffuses itself. And also from another curious ex∣periment
of Dr. Franklin's: he cut a piece of cork to about the size of a letter-wafer,
leaving a point standing off like a tangent at one edge of the circle. This piece of cork
was then dipped in oil and thrown into a large pond of water, and as the oil flowed off at
the point, the cork-wafer continued to revolve in a contrary direction for several minutes.
The oil flowing off all that time at the pointed tangent in coloured streams. In a small
pond of water this experiment does not so well succeed, as the circulation of the cork
stops as soon as the water becomes covered with the pellicle of oil. See Additional
Note, No. XIII. and Note on Fucus, Vol. II.</P>
<P>The ease with which oil and water slide over each other is agreeably seen if a phial be
about half filled with equal parts of oil and water, and made to oscillate suspended by a
string, the upper surface of the oil and the lower one of the water will always keep
smooth; but the agitation of the surfaces where the oil and water meet, is curious; for
their specific gravities being not very different, and their friction on each other nothing,
the highest side of the water, as the phial descends in its oscillation, having acquired a
greater momentum than the lowest side (from its having descended further) would rise
the highest on the ascending side of the oscillation, and thence pushes the then uppermost
part of the water amongst the oil.</P>

<P>THE Teredo, or ship-worm, has two calcareous jaws, hemispherical, flat before,
and angular behind. The shell is taper, winding, penetrating ships and submarine
wood, and was brought from India into Europe, Linnei System. Nat. p. 1267. The
Tarieres, or sea-worms, attack and erode ships with such fury, and in such num∣bers,
as often greatly to endanger them. It is said that our vessels have not known
this new enemy above fifty years, that they were brought from the sea about the
Antilles to our parts of the ocean, where they have increased prodigiously. They bore
their passage in the direction of the fibres of the wood, which is their nourishment, and
cannot return or pass obliquely, and thence when they come to a knot in the wood, or
when two of them meet together with their stony mouths, they perish for want of
food.</P>
<P>In the years 1731 and 1732 the United Provinces were under a dreadful alarm
concerning these insects, which had made great depredation on the piles which support
the banks of Zeland, but it was happily discovered a few years afterwards that these
insects had totally abandoned that island, (Dict. Raisonné, art. Vers Rongeurs,) which
might have been occasioned by their not being able to live in that latitude when the

<Q><L>Turn the broad helm, the fluttering canvas urge</L>
<L>From Maelstrom's fierce innavigable surge. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 93.</BIBL></Q>
<P>ON the coast of Norway there is an extensive vortex, or eddy, which lies between the
islands of Moskoe and Moskenas, and is called Moskoestrom, or Maelstrom; it occupies
some leagues in circumference, and is said to be very dangerous and often destructive
to vessels navigating these seas. It is not easy to understand the existence of a
constant descending stream without supposing it must pass through a subterranean
cavity to some other part of the earth or ocean which may lie beneath its level; as the
Mediterranean seems to lie beneath the level of the Atlantic ocean, which therefore
<PB N="77" REF="311"/>
constantly flows into it through the Straits; and the waters of the Gulph of Mexico
lie much above the level of the sea about the Floridas and further northward, which
gives rise to the Gulph-stream, as described in note on Cassia in Vol. II.</P>
<P>The Maelstrom is said to be still twice in about twenty-four hours when the tide is
up, and most violent at the opposite times of the day. This is not difficult to account
for, since when so much water is brought over the subterraneous passage, if such exists,
as compleatly to fill it and stand many feet above it, less disturbance must appear on the
surface. The Maelstrom is described in the Memoires of the Swedish Academy of
Sciences, and Pontoppiden's Hist. of Norway, and in Universal Museum for 1763,
p. 131.</P>
<P>The reason why eddies of water become hollow in the middle is because the water
immediately over the centre of the well, or cavity, falls faster, having less friction to
oppose its descent, than the water over the circumference or edges of the well. The
circular motion or gyration of eddies depends on the obliquity of the course of the
stream, or to the friction or opposition to it being greater on one side of the well than
the other; I have observed in water passing through a hole in the bottom of a trough,
which was always kept full, the gyration of the stream might be turned either way by
increasing the opposition of one side of the eddy with ones finger, or by turning the
spout, through which the water was introduced, a little more obliquely to the hole on
one side or on the other. Lighter bodies are liable to be retained long in eddies of
water, while those rather heavier than water are soon thrown out beyond the circum∣ference
by their acquired momentum becoming greater than that of the water. Thus if
equal portions of oil and water be put into a phial, and by means of a string be whirled
in a circle round the hand, the water will always keep at the greater distance from the
centre, whence in the eddies formed in rivers during a flood a person who endeavours
to keep above water or to swim is liable to be detained in them, but on suffering himself
to sink or dive he is said readily to escape. This circulation of water in descending
through a hole in a vessel Dr. Franklin has ingeniously applied to the explanation of
hurricanes or eddies of air.</P>

<Q><L>While round dark crags imprison'd waters bend</L>
<L>Through rifted ice, in ivory veins descend. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO III.</HI> l. 113.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE common heat of the interior parts of the earth being always 48 degrees, both in
winter and summer, the snow which lies in contact with it is always in a thawing state;
Hence in ice-houses the external parts of the collection of ice is perpetually thawing and
thus preserves the internal part of it; so that it is necessary to lay up many tons for the
preservation of one ton. Hence in Italy considerable rivers have their source from
beneath the eternal glaciers, or mountains of snow and ice.</P>
<P>In our country when the air in the course of a frost continues a day or two at very
near 32 degrees, the common heat of the earth thaws the ice on its surface, while the
thermometer remains at the freezing point. This circumstance is often observable in
the rimy mornings of spring; the thermometer shall continue at the freezing point,
yet all the rime will vanish, except that which happens to lie on a bridge, a board, or on
a cake of cow-dung, which being thus as it were insulated or cut off from so free a com∣munication
with the common heat of the earth by means of the air under the bridge, or
wood, or dung, which are bad conductors of heat, continues some time longer unthawed.
Hence when the ground is covered thick with snow, though the frost continues, and the
sun does not shine, yet the snow is observed to decrease very sensibly. For the common
heat of the earth melts the under surface of it, and the upper one evaporates by its
solution in the air. The great evaporation of ice was observed by Mr. Boyle, which
experiment I repeated some time ago. Having suspended a piece of ice by a wire and
weighed it with care without touching it with my hand, I hung it out the whole of a
clear frosty night, and sound in the morning it had lost nearly a fifth of its weight.
Mr. N. Wallerius has since observed that ice at the time of its congelation evaporates
faster than water in its fluid form; which may be accounted for from the heat given out
at the instant of freezing; (Saussure's Essais sur Hygromet. p. 249.) but this effect is
only momentary.</P>
<P>Thus the vegetables that are covered with snow are seldom injured; since, as they
lie between the thawing snow, which has 32 degrees of heat, and the covered earth
which has 48, they are preserved in a degree of heat between these; viz. in 40 degrees of
heat. Whence the moss on which the rein-deer feed in the northern latitudes vegetates
beneath the snow; (See note on Muschus, Vol. II.) and hence many Lapland and Alpine
plants perished through cold in the botanic garden at Upsal, for in their native situations,
though the cold is much more intense, yet at its very commencement they are covered
deep with snow, which remains till late in the spring. For this fact see Amaenit.
Academ. Vol. I. No. 48. In our climate such plants do well covered with dried fern,
under which they will grow, and even flower, till the severe vernal frosts cease. For
the increase of glaciers see Note on Canto I. l. 529.</P>

<Q><L>While southern gales o'er western oceans roll,</L>
<L>And Eurus steas his ice-winds from the pole. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 15</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE theory of the winds is yet very imperfect, in part perhaps owing to the want
of observations sufficiently numerous of the exact times and places where they begin and
cease to blow, but chiefly to our yet imperfect knowledge of the means by which great
regions of air are either suddenly produced or suddenly destroyed.</P>
<P>The air is perpetually subject to increase or diminution from its combination with
other bodies, or its evolution from them. The vital part of the air, called oxygene, is
continually produced in this climate from the perspiration of vegetables in the sunshine,
and probably from the action of light on clouds or on water in the tropical climates,
where the sun has greater power, and may exert some yet umknown laws of luminous
combination. Another part of the atmosphere, which is called azote, is perpetually set
at liberty from animal and vegetable bodies by putrefaction or combustion, from many
springs of water, from volatile alcali, and probably from fixed alcali, of which there is an
exhaustless source in the water of the ocean. Both these component parts of the air are
perpetually again diminished by their contact with the soil, which covers the surface
of the earth, producing nitre. The oxygene is diminished in the production of all acids,
of which the carbonic and muriatic exist in great abundance. The azote is diminished
in the growth of animal bodies, of which it constitutes an important part, and in its
combinations with many other natural productions.</P>
<P>They are both probably diminished in immense quantities by uniting with the
inflammable air, which arises from the mud of rivers and lakes at some seasons, when
the atmosphere is light: the oxgene of the air producing water, and the azote producing
volatile alcali by their combinations with this inflammable air. At other seasons of the
year these principles may again change their combinations, and the atmospheric air be
reproduced.</P>
<P>Mr. Lavoisier found that one pound of charcoal in burning consumed two pounds
nine ounces of vital air, or oxygene. The consumption of vital air in the process of
making red lead may readily be reduced to calculation; a small barrel contains about
twelve hundred weight of this commodity, 1200 pounds of lead by calcination absorb
about 144 pounds of vital air; now as a cubic foot of water weighs 1000 averdupois
ounces, and as vital air is above 800 times lighter than water, it follows that every barrel
of red lead contains nearly 2000 cubic feet of vital air. If this can be performed in
miniature in a small oven, what may not be done in the immense elaboratories of
nature!</P>
<P>These great elaboratories of nature include almost all her fossil as well as her animal
and vegetable productions. Dr. Priestley obtained air of greater or less purity, both
<PB N="80" REF="314"/>
vital and azotic, from almost all the fossil substances he subjected to experiment. Four
ounce-weight of lava from Iceland heated in an earthen retort yielded twenty ounce-measures
of air.</P>

<P>In this account the fixed air was previously extracted from the limestones by acids,
and the heat applied was much less than was necessary to extract all the air from the
bodies employed. Add to this the known quantities of air which are combined with the
calciform ores, as the ochres of iron, manganese, calamy, grey ore of lead, and some idea
may be formed of the great production of air in volcanic eruptions, as mentioned in
note on Chunda, Vol. II. and of the perpetual absorptions and evolutions of whole
oceans of air from every part of the earth.</P>
<P>But there would seem to be an officina aeris, a shop where air is both manufactured
and destroyed in the greatest abundance within the polar circles, as will hereafter be spoken
of. Can this be effected by some yet unknown law of the congelation of aqueous or
saline fluids, which may set at liberty their combined heat, and convert a part both of
the acid and alcali of sea-water into their component airs? Or on the contrary can the
electricity of the northern lights convert inflammable air and oxygene into water, whilst
the great degree of cold at the poles unites the azote with some other base? Another
officina aeris, or manufacture of air, would seem to exist within the tropics or at the
line, though in a much less quantity than at the poles, owing perhaps to the action of
the sun's light on the moisture suspended in the air, as will also be spoken of hereafter;
but in all other parts of the earth these absorptions and evolutions of air in a greater or
less degree are perpetually going on in inconceivable abundance; increased probably, and
diminished at different seasons of the year by the approach or retrocession of the sun's
light; future discoveries must elucidate this part of the subject. To this should be added
<PB N="81" REF="315"/>
that as heat and electricity, and perhaps magnetism, are known to displace air, that it is
not impossible but that the increased or diminished quantities of these fluids diffused in
the atmosphere may increase its weight a well as its bulk; since their specific attractions
or affinities to matter are very strong, they probably also possess general gravitation to the
earth; a subject which wants further investigation. See Note XXVI.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SOUTH-WEST WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>The velocity of the surface of the earth in moving round its axis diminishes from the
equator to the poles. Whence if a region of air in this country should be suddenly
removed a few degrees towards the north it must constitute a western wind, because
from the velocity it had previously acquired in this climate by its friction with the earth
it would for a time move quicker than the surface of the country it was removed to;
the contrary must ensue when a region of air is transported from this country a few
degrees southward, because the velocity it had acquired in this climate would be less
than that of the earth's surface where it was removed to, whence it would appear to
constitute a wind from the east, while in reality the eminent parts of the earth would
be carried against the too slow air. But if this transportation of air from south to north
be performed gradually, the motion of the wind will blow in the diagonal between
south and west. And on the contrary if a region of air be gradually removed from
north to south it would also blow diagonally between the north and east, from whence we
may safely conclude that all our winds in this country which blow from the north or east,
or any point between them, consist of regions of air brought from the north; and that
all our winds blowing from the south or west, or from any point between them, are
regions of air brought from the south.</P>
<P>It frequently happens during the vernal months that after a north-east wind has
passed over us for several weeks, during which time the barometer has stood at above
30 ½ inches, it becomes suddenly succeeded by a south-west wind, which also continues
several weeks, and the barometer sinks to nearly 28 ½ inches. Now as two inches of
the mercury in the barometer balance one-fifteenth part of the whole atmosphere, an
important question here presents itself, <HI>what is become of all this air.</HI></P>
<P>1. This great quantity of air can not be carried in a superior current towards the
line, while the inferior current flows towards the poles, because then it would equally
affect the barometer, which should not therefore subside from 30 ½ inches to 28 ½ for
six weeks together.</P>
<P>2. It cannot be owing to the air having lost all the moisture which was previously
dissolved in it, because these warm south-west winds are replete with moisture, and the
cold north-east winds, which weigh up the mercury in the barometer to 31 inches,
consist of dry air.</P>
<P>3. It can not be carried over the polar regions and be accumulated on the meridian
opposite to us in its passage towards the line, as such an accumulation would equal
one-fifteenth of the whole atmosphere, and can not be supposed to remain in that
situation for six weeks together,</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="316"/>
4. It can not depend on the existence of tides in the atmosphere, since it must then
correspond to lunar periods. Nor to accumulations of air from the specific levity of
the upper regions of the atmosphere, since its degree of fluidity must correspond with its
tenuity, and consequently such great mountains of air can not be supposed to exist for
so many weeks together as the south-west winds sometimes continue.</P>
<P>5. It remains therefore that there must be at this time a great and sudden absorption
of air in the polar circle by some unknown operation of nature, and that the south
wind runs in to supply the deficiency. Now as this south wind consists of air brought
from a part of the earth's surface which moves faster than it does in this climate it
must have at the same time a direction from the west by retaining part of the velocity
it had previously acquired. These south-west winds coming from a warmer country,
and becoming colder by their contact with the earth of this climate, and by their
evpansion, (so great a part of the superincumbent atmosphere having vanished,) pre∣cipitate
their moisture; and as they continue for several weeks to be absorbed in the
polar circle would seem to receive a perpetual supply from the tropical regions, especially
over the line, as will hereafter be spoken of.</P>
<P>It may sometimes happen that a north-east wind having passed over us may be
bent down and driven back before it has acquired any heat from the climate, and may
thus for a few hours or a day have a south-west direction, and from its descending
from a higher region of the atmosphere may possess a greater degree of cold than an
inferior north-east current of air.</P>
<P>The extreme cold of Jan. 13, 1709, at Paris came on with a gentle south wind,
and was diminished when the wind changed to the north, which is accounted for by
Mr. Homberg from a reflux of air which had been flowing for some time from the
north. Chemical Essays by R. Watson, Vol. V. p. 182.</P>
<P>It may happen that a north-east current may for a day or two pass over us and
produce incessant rain by mixing with the inferior south-west current; but this as
well as the former is of short duration, as its friction will soon carry the inferior current
along with it, and dry or frosty weather will then succeed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NORTH-EAST WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>The north-east winds of this country consist of regions of air from the north,
travelling sometimes at the rate of about a mile in two minutes during the vernal
months for several weeks together from the polar regions toward the south, the
mercury in the barometer standing above 30. These winds consist of air greatly
cooled by the evaporation of the ice and snow over which it passes, and as they become
warmer by their contact with the earth of this climate are capable of dissolving more
moisture as they pass along, and are thence attended with frosts in winter and with dry
hot weather in summer.</P>
<P>1. This great quantity of air can not be supplied by superior currents passing in a
contrary direction from south to north, because such currents must as they arise into
the atmosphere a mile or two high become exposed to so great cold as to occasion them
<PB N="83" REF="317"/>
to deposit their moisture, which would fall through the inferior current upon the earth
in some part of their passage.</P>
<P>2. The whole atmosphere must have increased in quantity, because it appears by
the barometer that there exists one-fifteenth part more air over us for many weeks
together, which could not be thus accumulated by difference of temperature in respect
to heat, or by any aerostatic laws at present known, or by any lunar influence.</P>
<P>From whence it would appear that immense masses of air were set at liberty from
their combinations with solid bodies, along with a sufficient quantity of combined heat,
within the polar circle, or in some region to the north of us; and that they thus per∣petually
increase the quantity of the atmosphere; and that this is again at certain times
re-absorbed, or enters into new combinations at the line or tropical regions. By which
wonderful contrivance the atmosphere is perpetually renewed and rendered fit for the
support of animal and vegetable life.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SOUTH-EAST WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>The south-east winds of this country consist of air from the north which had passed
by us, or over us, and before it had obtained the velocity of the earth's surface in this
climate had been driven back, owing to a deficiency of air now commencing at the
polar regions. Hence these are generally dry or freezing winds, and if they succeed
north-east winds should prognosticate a change of wind from north-east to south-west;
the barometer is generally about 30. They are sometimes attended with cloudy
weather, or rain, owing to their having acquired an increased degree of warmth and
moisture before they became retrograde; or to their being mixed with air from the
south.</P>
<P>2. Sometimes these south-east winds consist of a vertical eddy of north-east air,
without any mixture of south-west air; in that case the barometer continues above 30,
and the weather is dry or frosty for four or five days together.</P>
<P>It should here be observed, that air being an elastic fluid must be more liable to eddies
than water, and that these eddies must extend into cylinders or vortexes of greater
diameter, and that if a vertical eddy of north-east air be of small diameter or has passed
but a little way to the south of us before its return, it will not have gained the velocity
of the earth's surface to the south of us, and will in consequence become a south-east
wind.—But if the vertical eddy be of large diameter, or has passed much to the south of
us, it will have acquired velocity from its friction with the earth's surface to the south
of us, and will in consequence on its return become a south-west wind, producing great
cold.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>NORTH-WEST WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>There seem to be three sources of the north-west winds of this hemisphere of the
earth. 1. When a portion of southern air, which was passing over us, is driven back
by accumulation of new air in the polar regions. In this cafe I suppose they are gene∣rally
moist or rainy winds, with the barometer under 30, and if the wind had previously
been in the south-west, it would seem to prognosticate a change to the north-east.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="318"/>
2. If a current of north wind is passing over us but a few miles high, without any
easterly direction; and is bent down upon us, it must immediately possess a westerly
direction, because it will now move faster than the surface of the earth where it arrives;
and thus becomes changed from a north-east to a north-west wind. This descent of a
north-east current of air producing a north-west wind may continue some days with
clear or freezing weather, as it may be simply owing to a vertical eddy of north-east
air, as will be spoken of below. It may otherwise be forced down by a current of
south-west wind passing over it, and in this case it will be attended with rain for a few
days by the mixture of the two airs of different degrees of heat; and will prognosticate a
change of wind from north-east to south-west if the wind was previously in the north-east
quarter.</P>
<P>3. On the eastern coast of North America the north-west winds bring frost, as the
north-east winds do in this country, as appears from variety of testimony. This seems
to happen from a vertical spiral eddy made in the atmosphere between the shore and the
ridge of mountains which form the spine or back-bone of that continent. If a current
of water runs along the hypothenuse of a triangle an eddy will be made in the included
angle, which will turn round like a water-wheel as the stream passes in contact with
one edge of it. The same must happen when a sheet of air flowing along from the
north-east rises from the shore in a straight line to the summit of the Apalachian
mountains, a part of the stream of north-east air will flow over the mountains, another
part will revert and circulate spirally between the summit of the country and the eastern
shore, continuing to move toward the south; and thus be changed from a north-east to
a north-west wind.</P>
<P>This vertical spiral eddy having been in contact with the cold summits of these
mountains, and descending from higher parts of the atmosphere will lose part of its
heat, and thus constitute one cause of the greater coldness of the eastern sides of North
America than of the European shores opposite to them, which is said to be equal to
twelve degrees of north latitude, which is a wonderful fact, not otherwise easy to be
explained, since the heat of the springs at Philadelphia is said to be 52, which is greater
than the medium heat of the earth in this country.</P>
<P>The existence of vertical eddies, or great cylinders of air rolling on the surface of
the earth, is agreeable to the observations of the constructors of windmills; who on
this idea place the area of the fails leaning backwards, inclined to the horizon; and
believe that then they have greater power than when they are placed quite perpen∣dicularly.
The same kind of rolling cylinders of water obtain in rivers owing to the
friction of the water against the earth at their bottoms; as is known by bodies having
been observed to float upon their surfaces quicker than when immersed to a certain
depth. These vertical eddies of air probably exist all over the earth's surface, but
particularly at the bottom or sides of mountains; and more so probably in the course
of the south-west than of the north-east winds; because the former fall from an emi∣nence,
as it were, on a part of the earth where there is a deficiency of the quantity of
air; as is shewn by the sinking of the barometer: whereas the latter are pushed or
<PB N="85" REF="319"/>
squeezed forward by an addition to the atmosphere behind them, as appears by the rising
of the barometer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TRADE-WINDS.</HEAD>
<P>A column of heated air becomes lighter than before, and will therefore ascend, by the
pressure of the cold air which surrounds it, like a cork in water, or like heated smoke in
a chimney.</P>
<P>Now as the sun passes twice over the equator for once over either tropic, the equator
has not time to become cool; and on this account it is in general hotter at the line than
at the tropics; and therefore the air over the line, except in some few instances hereafter
to be mentioned, continues to ascend at all seasons of the year, pressed upwards by regions
of air brought from the tropics.</P>
<P>This air thus brought from the tropics to the equator, would constitute a north wind
on one side of the equator, and a south wind on the other; but as the surface of the earth
at the equator moves quicker than the surface of the earth at the tropics, it is evident that
a region of air brought from either tropic to the equator, and which had previously only
acquired the velocity of the earth's surface at the tropics, will now move too flow for the
earth's surface at the equator, and will thence appear to move in a direction contrary to
the motion of the earth. Hence the trade-winds, though they consist of regions of air
brought from the north on one side of the line, and from the south on the other, will
appear to have the diagonal direction of north-east and south-west winds.</P>
<P>Now it is commonly believed that there are superior currents of air passing over these
north-east and south-west currents in a contrary direction, and which descending near
the tropics produce vertical whirlpools of air. An important question here again pre∣sents
itself, <HI>What becomes of the moisture which this heated air ought to deposit, as it cools
in the upper regions of the atmosphere in its journey to the tropics?</HI> It has been shewn by
Dr. Priestley and Mr. Ingenhouz that the green matter at the bottom of cisterns, and the
fresh leaves of plants immersed in water, give out considerable quantities of vital air in
the sun-shine; that is, the perspirable matter of plants (which is water much divided in
its egress from their minute pores) becomes decomposed by the sun's light, and converted
into two kinds of air, the vital and inflammable airs. The moisture contained or dis∣solved
in the ascending heated air at the line must exist in great tenuity; and by being
exposed to the great light of the sun in that climate, the water may be decomposed, and
the new airs spread on the atmosphere from the line to the poles.</P>
<P>1. From there being no constant deposition of rains in the usual course of the trade-winds,
it would appear that the water rising at the line is decomposed in its ascent.</P>
<P>2. From the observations of M. Bougner on the mountain Pinchinca, one of the
Cordelieres immediately under the line, there appears to be no condensible vapour above
three or four miles high. Now though the atmosphere at that height may be cold to a
very considerable degree; yet its total deprivation of condensible vapour would seem to
shew, that its water was decomposed; as there are no experiments to evince that any de∣gree
of cold hitherto known has been able to deprive air of its moisture; and great
<PB N="86" REF="320"/>
abundance of snow is deposited from the air that flows to the polar regions, though it is
exposed to no greater degrees of cold in its journey thither than probably exists at four
miles height in the atmosphere at the line.</P>
<P>3. The hygrometer of Mr. Saussure also pointed to dryness as he ascended into rarer
air; the single hair of which it was constructed, contracting from deficiency of moisture.
Essais sur l'Hygromet. p. 143.</P>
<P>From these observations it appears either that rare and cold air requires more moisture
to saturate it than dense air; or that the moisture becomes decomposed and converted
into air, as it ascends into there cold and rare regions of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>4. There seems some analogy between the circumstance of air being produced or
generated in the cold parts of the atmosphere both at the line and at the poles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MONSOONS AND TORNADOES.</HEAD>
<P>1. In the Arabian and Indian seas are winds, which blow fix months one way, and
six months the other, and are called Monsoons; by the accidental dispositions of land
and sea it happens, that in some places the air near the tropic is supposed to become
warmer when the sun is vertical over it, than at the line. The air in these places con∣sequently
ascends pressed upon one side by the north-east regions of air, and on the other
side by the south-west regions of air. For as the air brought from the south has pre∣viously
obtained the velocity of the earth's surface at the line, it moves faster than the
earth's surface near the tropic where it now arrives, and becomes a south-west wind,
while the air from the north becomes a north-east wind as before explained. These two
winds do not so quietly join and ascend as the north-east and south-east winds, which
meet at the line with equal warmth and velocity and form the trade-winds; but as they
meet in contrary directions before they ascend, and cannot be supposed accurately to ba∣lance
each other, a rotatory motion will be produced as they ascend like water falling
through a hole, and an horizontal or spiral eddy is the consequence; these eddies are more
or less rapid, and are called Tornadoes in their most violent state, raising water from the
ocean in the west or sand from the deserts of the east, in less violent degrees they only
mix together the two currents of north-east and south-west air, and produce by this
means incessant rains, as the air of the north-east acquires some of the heat from the
south-west wind, as explained in Note XXV. This circumstance of the eddies produced
by the monsoon-winds was seen by Mr. Bruce in Abyssinia; he relates that for many
successive mornings at the commencement of the rainy monsoon, he observed a cloud
of apparently small dimensions whirling round with great rapidity, and in a few minutes
the heavens became covered with dark clouds with consequent great rains. See Note on
Canto III. l. 125.</P>
<P>2. But it is not only at the place where the air ascends at the northern extremity of
the rainy monsoon, and where it forms tornadoes, as observed above by Mr. Bruce, but
over a great tract of country several degrees in length in certain parts as in the Arabian
sea, a perpetual rain for several months descends, similar to what happens for weeks to∣gether
in our own climate in a less degree during the south-west winds. Another important
<PB N="87" REF="321"/>
question presents itself here, <HI>If the climate to which this south-west wind arrives,
is not colder than that it comes from, why should it deposit its moisture during its whole
journey? if it be a colder climate, why does it come thither?</HI> The tornadoes of air
above described can extend but a little way, and it is not easy to conceive that a su∣perior
cold current of air can mix with an inferior one, and thus produce showers over
ten degrees of country, since at about three miles high there is perpetual frost; and what
can induce these narrow and shallow currents to flow over each other so many hundred
miles?</P>
<P>Though the earth at the northren extremity of this monsoon may be more heated by
certain circumstances of situation than at the line, yet it seems probable that the interme∣diate
country between that and the line, may continue colder than the line (as in other
parts of the earth) and hence that the air coming from the line to supply this ascent or
destruction of air at the northern extremity of the monsoon will be cooled all the way in
its approach, and in consequence deposit its water. It seems probable that at the northern
extremity of this monsoon, where the tornadoes or hurricanes exist, that the air not only
ascends but is in part converted into water, or otherwise diminished in quantity, as no
account is given of the existence of any superior currents of it.</P>
<P>As the south-west winds are always attended with a light atmosphere, an incipient
vacancy, or a great diminution of air must have taken place to the northward of them in
all parts of the earth wherever they exist, and a deposition of their moisture succeeds
their being cooled by the climate they arrive at, and not by a contrary current of cold air
over them, since in that case the barometer would not sink. They may thus in our own
country be termed monsoons without very regular periods.</P>
<P>3. Another cause of TORNADOES independent of the monsoons is ingeniously ex∣plained
by Dr. Franklin; when in the tropical countries a stratum of inferior air becomes
so heated by its contact with the warm earth, that its expansion is increased more
than is equivalent to the pressure of the stratum of air over it; or when the superior
stratum becomes more condensed by cold than the inferior one by pressure, the upper
region will descend and the lower one ascend. In this situation if one part of the atmos∣phere
be hotter from some fortuitous circumstances, or, has less pressure over it, the
lower stratum will begin to ascend at this part, and resemble water falling through a hole
as mentioned above. If the lower region of air was going forwards with considerable
velocity, it will gain an eddy by rising up this hole in the incumbent heavy air, so that
the whirlpool or tornado has not only its progressive velocity, but its circular one also,
which thus lifts up or overturns every thing within its spiral whirl. By the weaker
whirlwinds in this country the trees are sometimes thrown down in a line of only twenty
or forty yards in breadth, making a kind of avenue through a country. In the West
Indies the sea rises like a cone in the whirl, and is met by black clouds produced by the
cold upper air and the warm lower air being rapidly mixed; whence are produced the
great and sudden rains called water-spouts; while the upper and lower airs exchange
their plus or minus electricity in perpetual lightenings.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="88" REF="322"/>
<HEAD>LAND AND SEA-BREEZES.</HEAD>
<P>The sea being a transparent mass is less heated at its surface by the sun's rays than
the land, and its continual change of surface contributes to preserve a greater uniformity
in the heat of the air which hangs over it. Hence the surface of the tropical islands is
more heated during the day than the sea that surrounds them, and cools more in the
night by its greater elevation: whence in the afternoon when the lands of the tropical
islands have been much heated by the sun, the air over them ascends pressed upwards by
the cooler air of the incircling ocean, in the morning again the land becoming cooled
more than the sea, the air over it descends by its increased gravity, and blows over the
ocean near its shores.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>1. There are various irregular winds besides those above described, which consist of
horizontal or vertical eddies of air owing to the inequality of the earth's surface, or the
juxtaposition of the sea. Other irregular winds have their origin from increased evapora∣tion
of water, or its sudden devaporation and descent in showers; others from the partial
expansion and condensation of air by heat and cold; by the accumulation or defect of
electric fluid, or to the air's new production or absorption occasioned by local causes
not yet discovered. See Notes VII. and XXV.</P>
<P>2. There seem to exist only two original winds: one consisting of air brought from
the north, and the other of air brought from the south. The former of these winds has
also generally an apparent direction from the east, and the latter from the west, arising
from the different velocities of the earth's surface. All the other winds above described
are deflections or retrogressions of some parts of these currents of air from the north or
south.</P>
<P>3. One fifteenth part of the atmosphere is occasionally destroyed, and occasionally re∣produced
by unknown causes. These causes are brought into immediate activity over a
great part of the surface of the earth at nearly the same time, but always act more power∣ful
to the northward than to the southward of any given place; and would hence seem
to have their principal effect in the polar circles, existing nevertheless though with less
power toward the tropics or at the line.</P>
<P>For when the north-east wind blows the barometer rises, sometimes from 28 ½ inches
to 30 ½, which shews a great new generation of air in the north; and when the south∣west
wind blows the barometer sinks as much, which shews a great destruction of air in
the north. But as the north-east winds sometimes continue for five or six weeks, the
newly-generated air must be destroyed at those times in the warmer climates to the south
of us, or circulate in superior currents, which has been shewn to be improbable from its
not depositing its water. And as the south-west winds sometimes continue for some
weeks, there must be a generation of air to the south at those times, or superior currents,
which last has been shewn to be improbable.</P>
<P>4. The north-east winds being generated about the poles are pushed forwards towards
the tropics or line, by the pressure from behind, and hence they become warmer, as
<PB N="89" REF="323"/>
explained in Note VII. as well as by their coming into contact with a warmer part of
the earth which contributes to make these winds greedily absorb moisture in their passage.
On the contrary, the south-west winds, as the atmosphere is suddenly diminished in the
polar regions, are drawn as it were into an incipient vacancy, and become therefore
expanded in their passage, and thus generate cold, as explained in Note VII. and are
thus induced to part with their moisture, as well as by their contact with a colder
part of the earth's surface. Add to this, that the difference in the sound of the north-east
and south-west winds may depend on the former being pushed forwards by a pressure
behind, and the latter falling as it were into a partial or incipient vacancy before;
whence the former becomes more condensed, and the latter more rarefied as it passes.
There is a whistle, termed a lark-call, which consists of a hollow cylinder of tin-plate,
closed at each end, about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch high, with
opposite holes about the size of a goose-quill through the centre of each end; if this lark-whistle
be held between the lips the sound of it is manifestly different when the breath
is forceably blown through it from within outwards, and when it is sucked from
without inwards. Perhaps this might be worthy the attention of organ-builders.</P>
<P>5. A stop is put to this new generation of air, when about a fifteenth of the whole is
produced, by its increasing pressure; and a similar boundary is fixed to its absorption or
destruction by the decrease of atmospheric pressure. As water requires more heat to
convert it into vapour under a heavy atmosphere than under a light one, so in letting off
the water from muddy fish-ponds great quantities of air-bubbles are seen to ascend from
the bottom, which were previously confined there by the pressure of the water. Similar
bubbles of inflammable air are seen to arise from lakes in many seasons of the year,
when the atmosphere suddenly becomes light.</P>
<P>6. The increased absorptions and evolutions of air must, like its simple expansions,
depend much on the presence or absence of heat and light, and will hence, in respect
to the times and places of its production and destruction, be governed by the approach
or retrocession of the sun, and on the temperature, in regard to heat, of various latitudes,
and parts of the same latitude, so well explained by Mr. Kirwan.</P>
<P>7. Though the immediate cause of the destruction or reproduction of great masses
of air at certain times, when the wind changes from north to south, or from south to
north can not yet be ascertained; yet as there appears greater difficulty in accounting for
this change of wind for any other known causes, we may still suspect that there exists in
the arctic and antarctic circles a BEAR or DRAGON yet unknown to philosophers, which
at times suddenly drinks up, and as suddenly at other times vomits out one-fifteenth
part of the atmosphere: and hope that this or some future age will learn how to govern
and domesticate a monster which might be rendered of such important service to mankind.</P>

1. To mark the hour when the wind changes from north-east to south-west, and the
contrary. This might be managed by making a communication from the vane of a
weathercock to a clock; in such a manner, that if the vane should revolve quite round,
a tooth on its revolving axis should stop the clock, or put back a small bolt on the edge
of a wheel revolving once in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>2. To discover whether in a year more air passed from north to south, or the con∣trary.
This might be effected by placing a windmill-sail of copper about nine inches
diameter in a hollow cylinder about six inches long, open at both ends, and fixed on an
eminent situation exactly north and south. Thence only a part of the north-east and
south-west currents would affect the sail so as to turn it; and if its revolutions were
counted by an adapted machinery, as the sail would turn one way with the north
currents of air, and the contrary one with the south currents, the advance of the
counting finger either way would shew which wind had prevailed most at the end of
the year.</P>
<P>3. To discover the rolling cylinders of air, the vane of a weathercock might be so
suspended as to dip or rise vertically, as well as to have its horizontal rotation.</P>

<HEAD>RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>NORTH-EAST WINDS consist of air flowing from the north, where it seems to be
occasionally produced; has an apparent direction from the east owing to its not having
acquired in its journey the increasing velocity of the earth's surface; these winds are
analogous to the trade-winds between the tropics, and frequently continue in the vernal
months for four and six weeks together, with a high barometer, and fair or frosty
weather. 2. They sometimes consist of south-west air, which had passed by us or
over us, driven back by a new accumulation of air in the north. These continue but
a day or two, and are attended with rain. See Note XXV.</P>
<P>SOUTH-WEST WIND consists of air flowing from the south, and seems occasionally
absorbed at its arrival to the more northern latitudes. It has a real direction from the
west owing to its not having lost in its journey the greater velocity it had acquired from
the earth's surface from whence it came. These winds are analogous to the monsoons
between the tropics, and frequently continue for four or six weeks together, with a
low barometer and rainy weather. 2. They sometimes consist of north-east air, which
had passed by us or over us, which becomes retrograde by a commencing deficiency of
air in the north. These winds continue but a day or two, attended with severer frost
with a sinking barometer; their cold being increased by their expansion, as they return,
into an incipient vacancy.</P>
<P>NORTH-WEST WINDS consist, first, of south-west winds, which have passed over us,
bent down and driven back towards the south by newly generated northern air. They
continue but a day or two, and are attended with rain or clouds. 2. They consist of
north-east winds bent down from the higher parts of the atmosphere, and having there
acquired a greater velocity than the earth's surface; are frosty or fair. 3. They consist of
north-east winds formed into a vertical spiral eddy, as on the eastern coasts of North
America, and bring severe frost.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="325"/>
SOUTH-EAST WINDS consist, first, of north-east winds become retrograde, continue
for a day or two, frosty or fair, sinking barometer. 2. They consist of north-east winds
formed into a vertical eddy not a spiral one, frost or fair.</P>
<P>NORTH WINDS consist, first, of air flowing slowly from the north, so that they acquire
the velocity of the earth's surface as they approach, are fair or frosty, seldom occur.
2. They consist of retrograde south winds; these continue but a day or two, are pre∣ceded
by south-west winds; and are generally succeeded by north-east winds, cloudy
or rainy, barometer rising.</P>
<P>SOUTH WINDS consist, first, of air flowing slowly from the south, loosing their previous
western velocity by the friction of the earth's surface as they approach, moist, seldom
occur. 2. They consist of retrograde north winds; these continue but a day or two, are
preceded by north-east winds, and generally succeeded by south-west winds, colder,
barometer sinking.</P>
<P>EAST WINDS consist of air brought hastily from the north, and not impelled farther
southward, owing to a sudden beginning absorption of air in the northern regions, very
cold, barometer high, generally succeeded by south-west wind.</P>
<P>WEST WINDS consist of air brought hastily from the south, and checked from pro∣ceeding
further to the north by a beginning production of air in the northern regions,
warm and moist, generally succeeded by north-east wind. 2. They consist of air bent
down from the higher regions of the atmosphere, if this air be from the south, and
brought hastily it becomes a wind of great velocity, moving perhaps 60 miles an hour,
is warm and rainy; if it consists of northern air bent down it is of less velocity and
colder.</P>

<HEAD>Application of the preceding Theory to some Extracts from a Journal of the
Weather.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 1, 1790. The barometer sunk suddenly, and the wind, which had been some
days north-east with frost, changed to south-east with an incessant though moderate
fall of snow. A part of the northern air, which had passed by us I suppose, now
became retrograde before it had acquired the velocity of the earth's surface to the south
of us, and being attended by some of the southern air in its journey, the moisture of the
latter became condensed and frozen by its mixture mith the former.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 2, 3. The wind changed to north-west and thawed the snow. A part of the
southern air, which had passed by us or over us, with the retrograde northern air above
described, was now in its turn driven back, before it had lost the velocity of the surface
of the earth to the south of us, and consequently became a north-west wind; and not
having lost the warmth it brought from the south produced a thaw.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 4, 5. Wind changed to north-east with frost and a rising barometer. The air
from the north continuing to blow, after it had driven back the southern air as above
described, became a north-east wind, having less velocity than the surface of the earth in
this climate, and produced frost from its coldness.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="326"/>
<HI>Dec.</HI> 6, 7. Wind now changed to the south-west with incessant rain and a sinking
barometer. From unknown causes I suppose the quantity of air to be diminished in the
polar regions, and the southern air cooled by the earth's surface, which was previously
frozen, deposits its moisture for a day or two; afterwards the wind continued south-west
without rain, as the surface of the earth became warmer.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 18, 1785. There has been a long frost; a few days ago the barometer sunk
to 29 ½, and the frost became more severe. Because the air being expanded by a part of
the pressure being taken off became colder. This day the mercury rose to 30, and the
frost ceased, the wind continuing as before between north and east. <HI>March</HI> 19. Mercury
above 30, weather still milder, no frost, wind north-east. <HI>March</HI> 20. The same, for
the mercury rising shews that the air becomes more compressed by the weight above▪
and in consequence gives out warmth.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 4, 5. Frost, wind north-east, the wind changed in the middle of the day to the
north-west without rain, and has done so for three or four days, becoming again north-east
at night. For the sun now giving greater degrees of heat, the air ascends as the
sun passes the zenith, and is supplied below by the air on the western side as well as on
the eastern side of the zenith during the hot part of the day; whence for a few hours, on
the approach of the hot part of the day, the air acquires a westerly direction in this
longitude. If the north-west wind had been caused by a retrograde motion of some
southern air, which had passed over us, it would have been attended with rain or clouds.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 10. It rained all day yesterday, the wind north-west, this morning there was a
sharp frost. The evaporation of the moisture, (which fell yesterday) occasioned by the
continuance of the wind, produced so much cold as to freeze the dew.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 12. Frequent showers with a current of colder wind preceding every shower.
The sinking of the rain or cloud pressed away the air from beneath it in its descent,
which having been for a time shaded from the sun by the floating cloud, became cooled
in some degree.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20. The barometer sunk, the wind became south-west, and the whole heaven
was instantly covered with clouds. A part of the incumbent atmosphere having
vanished, as appeared by the sinking of the barometer, the remainder became expanded
by its elasticity, and thence attracted some of the matter of heat from the vapour inter∣mixed
with it, and thus in a few minutes a total devaporation took place, as in ex∣hausting
the receiver of an air-pump. See note XXV. At the place where the air is
destroyed, currents both from the north and south flow in to supply the deficiency, (for
it has been shewn that there are no other proper winds but these two) and the mixture
of these winds produces so sudden condensation of the moisture, both by the coldness of
the northern air and the expansion of both of them, that lightning is given out, and an
incipient tornado takes place; whence thunder is said frequently to approach against the
wind.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 28, 1732. Barometer was at 31, and <HI>Dec.</HI> 30, in the same year, it was at
28 2-tenths. Medical Essays, Edinburgh, Vol. II. p. 7. It appears from these journals
that the mercury at Edinburgh varies sometimes nearly three inches, or one tenth of
<PB N="93" REF="327"/>
the whole atmosphere. From the journals kept by the Royal Society at London it
appears seldom to vary more than two inches, or one-fifteenth of the whole atmosphere.
The quantity of the variation is said still to decrease nearer the line, and to increase in
the more northern latitudes; which much confirms the idea that there exists at certain
times a great destruction or production of air within the polar circle.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 2, 1732. The westerly winds in the journal in the Medical Essays, Vol. II.
above referred to, are frequently marked with the number three to shew their greater
velocity, whereas the easterly winds seldom approach to the number two. The greater
velocity of the westerly winds than the easterly ones is well known I believe in every
climate of the world; which may be thus explained from the theory above delivered.
1. When the air is still, the higher parts of the atmosphere move quicker than those
parts which touch the earth, because they are at a greater distance from the axis of
motion. 2. The part of the atmosphere where the north or south wind comes from
is higher than the part of it where it comes to, hence the more elevated parts of the
atmosphere continue to descend towards the earth as either of those winds approach.
3. When southern air is brought to us it possesses a westerly direction also, owing to
the velocity it had previously acquired from the earth's surface; and if it consists of air
from the higher parts of the atmosphere descending nearer the earth, this westerly
velocity becomes increased. But when northern air is brought to us, it possesses an
apparent easterly direction also, owing to the velocity which it had previously acquired
from the earth's surface being less than that of the earth's surface in this latitude; now if
the north-east wind consists of air descending from higher parts of the atmosphere, this
deficiency of velocity will be less, in consequence of the same cause, viz. The higher
parts of the atmosphere descending, as the wind approaches, increases the real velocity of
the western winds, and decreases the apparent velocity of the eastern ones.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 22. Wind changed from south-east to south-west. There is a popular prog∣nostication
that if the wind changes from the north towards the south passing through
the east, it is more likely to continue in the south, than if it passes through the west,
which may be thus accounted for. If the north-east wind changes to a north-west
wind, it shews either that a part of the northern air descends upon us in a spiral eddy,
or that a superior current of southern air is driven back; but if a north-east wind be
changed into a south-east wind it shews that the northern air is become retrograde, and
that in a day or two, as soon as that part of it has passed, which has not gained the
velocity of the earth's surface in this latitude, it will become a south wind for a few
hours, and then a south-west wind.</P>
<P>The writer of this imperfect sketch of anemology wishes it may incite some person of
greater leizure and ability to attend to this subject, and by comparing the various meteo∣rological
journals and observations already published, to construct a more accurate and
methodical treatise on this interesting branch of philosophy.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXIV.—VEGETABLE PERSPIRATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>And wed the enamoured Oxygene to Light. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 34.</BIBL></Q>
<P>WHEN points or hairs are put into spring-water, as in the experiments of Sir B.
Thompson, (Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXVII.) and exposed to the light of the sun, much
air, which loosely adhered to the water, rises in bubbles, as explained in note on Fucus,
Vol. II. A still greater quantity of air, and of a purer kind, is emitted by Dr. Priestley's
green matter, and by vegetable leaves growing in water in the sun-shine, according to
Mr. Ingenhouze's experiments; both which I suspect to be owing to a decomposition of
the water perspired by the plant, for the edge of a capillary tube of great tenuity may be
considered as a circle of points, and as the oxygene, or principle of vital air, may be ex∣panded
into a gas by the sun's light; the hydrogene or inflammable air may be detained
in the pores of the vegetable.</P>
<P>Hence plants growing in the shade are white, and become green by being exposed to
the sun's light; for their natural colour being blue, the addition of hydrogene adds
yellow to this blue, and <HI>tans</HI> them green. I suppose a similar circumstance takes place
in animal bodies; their perspirable matter as it escapes in the sun-shine becomes decom∣posed
by the edges of their pores as in vegetables, though in less quantity, as their per∣spiration
is less, and by the hydrogene being retained the skin becomes <HI>tanned</HI> yellow.
In proof of this it must be observed that both vegetable and animal substances become
bleached white by the sun-beams when they are dead, as cabbage-stalks, bones, ivory,
tallow, bees-wax, linen and cotton cloth; and hence I suppose the copper-coloured
natives of sunny countries might become etiolated or blanched by being kept from their
infancy in the dark, or removed for a few generations to more northerly climates.</P>
<P>It is probable that on a sunny morning much pure air becomes separated from the
dew by means of the points of vegetables on which it adheres, and much inflammable
air imbibed by the vegetable, or combined with it; and by the sun's light thus decom∣posing
water the effects of it in bleaching linen seems to depend (as described in
Note X.): the water is decomposed by the light at the ends or points of the cotton or
thread, and the vital air unites with the phlogistic or colouring matters of the cloth,
and produces a new acid, which is either itself colourless or washes out, at the same
time the inflammable part of the water escapes. Hence there seems a reason why cotton
bleaches so much sooner than linen, viz. because its fibres are three or four times
shorter, and therefore protrude so many more points, which seem to facilitate the
liberation of the vital air from the inflammable part of the water.</P>
<P>Bee's wax becomes bleached by exposure to the sun and dews in a similar manner as
metals become calcined or rusty, viz. by the water on their surface being decomposed;
and hence the inflammable material which caused the colour becomes united with vital
air forming a new acid, and is washed away.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="329"/>
Oil close stopped in a phial not full, and exposed long to the sun's light, becomes
bleached, as I suppose, by the decomposition of the water it contains; the inflammable
air rising above the surface, and the vital air uniting with the colouring matter of the oil.
For it is remarkable, that by shutting up a phial of bleached oil in a dark drawer, it in a
little time becomes coloured again.</P>
<P>The following experiment shews the power of light in separating vital air from
another basis, viz. from azote. Mr. Scheel inverted a glass vessel filled with colourless
nitrous acid into another glass containing the same acid, and on exposing them to the
sun's light, the inverted glass became partly filled with pure air, and the acid at the same
time became coloured. Scheel in Crell's Annal. 1786. But if the vessel of colourless
nitrous acid be quite full and stopped, so that no space is left for the air produced to ex∣pand
itself into, no change of colour takes place. Priestley's Exp. VI. p. 344. See Keir's
very excellent Chemical Dictionary, p. 99. new edition.</P>
<P>A sun-flower three feet and half high according to the experiment of Dr. Hales, per∣spired
two pints in one day (Vegetable Statics.) which is many times as much in pro∣portion
to its surface, as is perspired from the surface and lungs of animal bodies; it
follows that the vital air liberated from the surfaces of plants by the sunshine must much
exceed the quantity of it absorbed by their respiration, and that hence they improve the air
in which they live during the light part of the day, and thus blanched vegetables will
sooner become <HI>tanned into green</HI> by the sun's light, than etiolated animal bodies will be∣come
<HI>tanned yellow</HI> by the same means.</P>
<P>It is hence evident, that the curious discovery of Dr. Priestley, that his green vegetable
matter and other aquatic plants gave out vital air when the sun shone upon them, and
the leaves of other plants did the same when immersed in water, as observed by Mr.
Ingenhouze, refer to the perspiration of vegetables not to their respiration. Because Dr.
Priestley observed the pure air to come from both sides of the leaves and even from the
stalks of a water-flag, whereas one side of the leaf only serves the of the office of lungs, and
certainly not the stalks. Exper. on Air, Vol. III. And thus in respect to the circum∣stance
in which plants and animals seemed the furtherest removed from each other, I
mean in their supposed mode of respiration, by which one was believed to purify the air
which the other had injured, they seem to differ only in degree, and the analogy between
them remains unbroken.</P>
<P>Plants are said by many writers to grow much faster in the night than in the day; as
is particularly observable in seedlings at their rising out of the ground. This probably
is a consequence of their sleep rather than of the absence of light; and in this I suppose
they also resemble animal bodies.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXV.—VEGETABLE PLACENTATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>While in bright veins the silvery sap ascends.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 419.</BIBL></Q>
<P>AS buds are the viviparous offspring of vegetables, it becomes necessary that
they should be furnished with placental vessels for their nourishment, till they acquire
lungs or leaves for the purpose of elaborating the common juices of the earth into nutri∣ment.
These vessels exist in bulbs and in seeds, and supply the young plant with a
sweet juice till it acquires leaves, as is seen in converting barley into malt, and appears
from the sweet taste of onions and potatoes, when they begin to grow.</P>
<P>The placental vessels belonging to the buds of trees are placed about the roots of
most, as the vine; so many roots are furnished with sweet or mealy matter as fern-root,
bryony, carrot, turnip, potatoe, or in the alburnum or sap-wood as in those trees which
produce manna, which is deposited about the month of August, or in the joints of sugar
cane, and grasses; early in the spring the absorbent mouths of these vessels drink up
moisture from the earth, with a saccharine matter lodged for that purpose during the
preceding autumn, and push this nutritive fluid up the vessels of the alburnum to every
individual bud, as is evinced by the experiments of Dr. Hales, and of Mr. Walker in the
Edinburgh Philosophical Transact. The former observed that the sap from the stump
of a vine, which he had cut off in the beginning of April, arose twenty-one feet high in
tubes affixed to it for that purpose, but in a few weeks it ceased to bleed at all, and Dr.
Walker marked the progress of the ascending sap, and found likewise that as soon as
the leaves became expanded the sap ceased to rise; the ascending juice of some trees is so
copious and so sweet during the sap-season that it is used to make wine, as the birch,
betula, and sycamore, acer pseudo-platinus, and particularly the palm.</P>
<P>During this ascent of the sap-juice each individual leaf-bud expands its new leaves, and
shoots down new roots, covering by their intertexture the old bark with a new one;
and as soon as these new roots (or bark) are capable of absorbing sufficient juices from
the earth for the support of each bud, and the new leaves are capable of performing their
office of exposing these juices to the influence of the air; the placental vessels cease
to act, coalesce, and are transformed from sap-wood, or alburnum, into inert wood;
serving only for the support of the new tree, which grows over them.</P>
<P>Thus from the pith of the new bud of the horse-chesnut five vessels pass out through
the circle of the placental vessels above described, and carry with them a minuter circle
of those vessels; these five bundles of vessels unite after their exit, and form the foot∣stalk
or petiole of the new five-fingered leaf, to be spoken of hereafter. This structure
is well seen by cutting off a leaf of the horse-chesnut (Aesculus Hippocastanum) in
September before it falls, as the buds of this tree are so large that the flower may be seen
in them with the naked eye.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="331"/>
After a time, perhaps about midsummer, another bundle of vessels passes from the
pith through the alburnum or sap-vessels in the bosom of each leaf, and unites by the
new bark with the leaf, which becomes either a flower-bud or a leaf-bud to be expanded
in the ensuing spring, for which purpose an apparatus of placental vessels are produced
with proper nutriment during the progress of the summer and autumn, and thus
the vegetable becomes annually increased, ten thousand buds often existing on one tree,
according to the estimate of Linneus. Phil. Bot.</P>
<P>The vascular connection of vegetable buds with the leaves in whose bosoms they are
formed is confirmed by the following experiment, (<HI>Oct.</HI> 20, 1781.) On the extremity
of a young bud of the Mimosa (sensitive plant) a small drop of acid of vitriol was put by
means of a pen, and, after a few seconds, the leaf in whose axilla it dwelt closed and
opened no more, though the drop of vitriolic acid was so small as apparently only to
injure the summit of the bud. Does not this seem to shew that the leaf and its bud
have connecting vessels though they arise at different times and from different parts of
the medulla or pith? And, as it exists previously to it, that the leaf is the parent of
the bud?</P>
<P>This placentation of vegetable buds is clearly evinced from the sweetness of the
rising sap, and from its ceasing to rise as soon as the leaves are expanded, and thus
compleats the analogy between buds and bulbs. Nor need we wonder at the length
of the umbilical cords of buds since that must correspond with their situation on
the tree, in the same manner as their lymphatics and arteries are proportionally
elongated.</P>
<P>It does not appear probable that any umbilical artery attends these placental ab∣sorbents,
since, as there seems to be no system of veins in vegetables to bring back
the blood from the extremities of their arteries, (except their pulmonary veins,) there
could not be any vegetable fluids to be returned to their placenta, which in vege∣tables
seems to be simply an organ for nutrition, whereas the placenta of the animal
foetus seems likewise to serve as a respiratory organ like the gills of fishes.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXVI.—VEGETABLE CIRCULATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>And refluent blood in milky eddies bends.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 420.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE individuality of vegetable buds was spoken of before, and is confirmed by the
method of raising all kinds of trees by Mr. Barnes. (Method of propagating Fruit Trees.
1759. Lond. Baldwin.) He cut a branch into as many pieces as there were buds or
leaves upon it, and wiping the two wounded ends dry he quickly applied to each a
cement, previously warmed a little, which consisted principally of pitch, and planted them
in the earth. The use of this cement I suppose to consist in its preventing the bud from
bleeding to death, though the author ascribes it to its antisceptic quality.</P>
<P>These buds of plants, which are thus each an individual vegetable, in many circum∣stances
resemble individual animals, but as animal bodies are detached from the earth,
and move from place to place in search of food, and take that food at considerable
intervals of time, and prepare it for their nourishment within their own bodies after
it is taken, it is evident they must require many organs and powers which are not
necessary to a stationary bud. As vegetables are immoveably fixed to the soil from
whence they draw their mourishment ready prepared, and this uniformly not at returning
intervals, it follows that in examining their anatome we are not to look for muscles of
locomotion, as arms and legs; nor for organs to receive and prepare their nourishment,
as a stomach and bowels; nor for a reservoir for it after it is prepared, as a general system
of veins, which in locomotive animals contains and returns the superfluous blood
which is left after the various organs of secretion have been supplied, by which con∣trivance
they are enabled to live a long time without new supplies of food.</P>
<P>The parts which we may expect to find in the anatome of vegetables correspondent
to those in the animal economy are, 1. A system of absorbent vessels to imbibe the
moisture of the earth similar to the lacteal vessels, as in the roots of plants; and another
system of absorbents similar to the lymphatics of animal bodies, opening its mouths
on the internal cells and external surfaces of vegetables; and a third system of ab∣sorbent
vessels correspondent with those of the placentation of the animal foetus. 2. A
pulmonary system correspondent to the lungs or gills of quadrupeds and fish, by
which the fluid absorbed by the lacteals and lymphatics may be exposed to the in∣fluence
of the air, this is done by the green leaves of plants, those in the air re∣sembling
lungs, and those in the water resembling gills; and by the petals of flowers.
3. Arterial systems to convey the fluid thus elaborated to the various glands of the
vegetable for the purposes of its growth, nutrition, and various secretions. 4. The
various glands which separate from the vegetable blood the honey, wax, gum, resin,
starch, sugar, essential oil, &amp;c. 5. The organs adapted for their propagation or re∣production.
6. Muscles to perform several motions of their parts.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="333"/>
I. The existence of that branch of the absorbent vessels of vegetables which resembles
the lacteals of animal bodies, and imbibes their nutriment from the moist earth, is
evinced by their growth so long as moisture is applied to their roots, and their quickly
withering when it is withdrawn.</P>
<P>Besides these absorbents in the roots of plants there are others which open their
mouths on the external surfaces of the bark and leaves, and on the internal surfaces of
all the cells, and between the bark and the alburnum or sap-wood; the existence of
these is shewn, because a leaf plucked off and laid with its under side on water will not
wither so soon as if left in the dry air,—the same if the bark alone of a branch which
is separated from a tree be kept moist with water,—and lastly, by moistening the
alburnum or sap-wood alone of a branch detached from a tree it will not so soon wither
as if left in the dry air. By the following experiment these vessels were agreeably visible
by a common magnifying glass, I placed in the summer of 1781 the footstalks of some
large fig-leaves about an inch deep in a decoction of madder, (rubia tinctorum,) and
others in a decoction of logwood, (haematoxylum campechense,) along with some sprigs
cut off from a plant of picris, these plants were chosen because their blood is white,
after some hours, and on the next day, on taking out either of these and cutting off
from its bottom about a quarter of an inch of the stalk an internal circle of red points
appeared, which were the ends of absorbent vessels coloured red with the decoction,
while an external ring of arteries was seen to bleed out hastily a milky juice, and at once
evinced both the absorbent and arterial system. These absorbent vessels have been called
by Grew, and Malphigi, and some other philosophers, bronchi, and erroneously supposed
to be air-vessels. It is probable that these vessels, when cut through, may effuse their
fluids, and receive air, their sides being too stiff to collapse; since dry wood emits air∣bubles
in the exhausted receiver in the same manner as moist wood.</P>
<P>The structure of these vegetable absorbents consists of a spiral line, and not of a vessel
interrupted with valves like the animal lymphatics, since on breaking almost any tender
leaf and drawing out some of the fibres which adhere longest this spiral structure
becomes visible even to the naked eye, and distinctly so by the use of a common lens.
See Grew, Plate 51.</P>
<P>In such a structure it is easy to conceive how a vermicular or peristaltic motion of
the vessel beginning at the lowest part of it, each spiral ring successively contracting itself
till it fills up the tube, must forcibly push forwards its contents, as from the roots of
vines in the bleeding season; and if this vermicular motion should begin at the upper
end of the vessel it is as easy to see how it must carry its contained fluid in a contrary
direction. The retrograde motion of the vegetable absorbent vessels is shewn by cutting
a forked branch from a tree, and immersing a part of one of the forks in water, which
will for many days prevent the other from withering; or it is shewn by planting a
willow branch with the wrong end upwards. This structure in some degree obtains in
the esophagus or throat of cows, who by similar means convey their food first downwards
<PB N="100" REF="334"/>
and afterward upwards by a retrograde motion of the annular muscles or cartilages for
the purpose of a second mastication of it.</P>
<P>II. The fluids thus drank up by the vegetable absorbent vessels from the earth, or
from the atmosphere, or from their own cells and interstices, are carried to the foot-stalk
of every leaf, where the absorbents belonging to each leaf unite into branches, forming
so many pulmonary arteries, and are thence dispersed to the extremities of the leaf, as
may be seen in cutting away slice after slice the footstalk of a horse-chesnut in September
before the leaf falls. There is then a compleat circulation in the leaf, a pulmonary vein
receiving the blood from the extremities of each artery on the upper side of the leaf,
and joining again in the footstalk of the leaf these veins produce so many arteries, or
aortas, which disperse the new blood over the new bark, elongating its vessels, or pro∣ducing
its secretions; but as a reservoir of blood could not be wanted by a vegetable bud
which takes in its nutriment at all times, I imagine there is no venous system, no veins
properly so called, which receive the blood which was to spare, and return it into the
pulmonary or arterial system.</P>
<P>The want of a system of veins was countenanced by the following experiment; I cut
off several stems of tall spurge, (Euphorbia helioscopia) in autumn, about the centre of
the plant, and observed tenfold the quantity of milky juice ooze from the upper than
from the lower extremity, which could hardly have happened if there had been a venous
system of vessels to return the blood from the roots to the leaves.</P>
<P>Thus the vegetable circulation, complete in the lungs, but probably in the other
part of the system deficient in respect to a system of returning veins, is carried forwards
without a heart, like the circulation through the livers of animals where the blood
brought from the intestines and mesentery by one vein is dispersed through the liver by
the vena portarum, which assumes the office of an artery. See Note XXXVII.</P>
<P>At the same time so minute are the vessels in the intertexture of the barks of plants,
which belong to each individual bud, that a general circulation may possibly exist,
though we have not yet been able to discover the venous part of it.</P>
<P>There is however another part of the circulation of vegetable juices visible to the
naked eye, and that is in the corol or petals of flowers, in which a part of the blood of
the plant is exposed to the influence of the air and light in the same manner as in the
foliage, as will be mentioned more at large in Notes XXXVII and XXXIX.</P>
<P>These circulations of their respective fluids seem to be carried on in the vessels of
plants precisely as in animal bodies by their irritability to the stimulus of their adapted
fluids, and not by any mechanical or chemical attraction, for their absorbent vessels
propel the juice upwards, which they drink up from the earth, with great violence; I
suppose with much greater than is exerted by the lacteals of animals, probably owing to
the greater minuteness of these vessels in vegetables and the greater rigidity of their coats.
Dr. Hales in the spring season cut off a vine near the ground, and by fixing tubes on the
remaining stump of it, found the sap to rise twenty-one feet in the tube by the propulsive
<PB N="101" REF="335"/>
power of these absorbents of the roots of it. Veget. Stat. p. 102. Such a power can not
be produced by capillary attraction, as that could only raise a fluid nearly to the upper
edge of the attracting cylinder, but not enable it to flow over that edge, and much less
to rise 21 feet above it. What then can this power be owing to? Doubtless to the living
activity of the absorbent vessels, and to their increased vivacity from the influence of the
warmth of the spring succeeding the winter's cold, and their thence greater susceptibility
to irritation from the juices which they absorb, resembling in all circumstances the
action of the living vessels of animals.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXVII.—VEGETABLE RESPIRATION.</HEAD>
<Q><L>While spread in air the leaves respiring play. </L><BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 421.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I. THERE have been various opinions concerning the use of the leaves of plants
in the vegetable oeconomy. Some have contended that they are perspiratory organs;
this does not seem probable from an experiment of Dr. Hales, Veg. Stat. p. 30. He
found by cutting off branches of trees with apples on them, and taking off the leaves, that
an apple exhaled about as much as two leaves, the surfaces of which were nearly equal
to the apple; whence it would appear that apples have as good a claim to be termed per∣spiratory
organs as leaves. Others have believed them excretory organs of excremen∣tious
juices; but as the vapour exhaled from vegetables has no taste, this idea is no more
probable than the other; add to this that in moist weather, they do not appear to per∣spire
or exhale at all.</P>
<P>The internal surface of the lungs or air-vessels in men, are said to be equal to the ex∣ternal
surface of the whole body, or about fifteen square feet; on this surface the blood
is exposed to the influence of the respired air through the medium however of a thin pel∣licle;
by this exposure to the air it has its colour changed from deep red to bright scarlet,
and acquires something so necessary to the existence of life, that we can live scarcely a
minute without this wonderful process.</P>
<P>The analogy between the leaves of plants and the lungs or gills of animals seems to
embrace so many circumstances, that we can scarcely withhold our assent to their per∣forming
similar offices.</P>
<P>1. The great surface of the leaves compared to that of the trunk and branches of trees
is such, that it would seem to be an organ well adapted for the purpose of exposing the
vegetable juices to the influence of the air; this however we shall see afterwards is pro∣bably
performed only by their upper surfaces, yet even in this case the surface of the
leaves in general bear a greater proportion to the surface of the tree, than the lungs of
animals to their external surfaces.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="336"/>
2. In the lungs of animal, the blood after having been exposed to the air in the ex∣tremities
of pulmonary artery, is changed in colour from deep red to bright scarlet, and
certainly in some of its essential properties; it is then collected by the pulmonary vein
and returned to the heart. To shew a similarity of circumstance in the leaves of plants
the following experiment was made, June 24, 1781: A stalk with leaves and seed-vessels
of large spurge (Euphorbia helioscopia) had been several days placed in a decoction
of madder (Rubia tinctorum) so that the lower part of the stem, and two of the undermost
leaves were immersed in it. After having washed the immersed leaves in clear water, I
could readily discern the colour of the madder passing along the middle rib of each leaf.
This red artery was beautifully visible both on the under and upper surface of the leaf;
but on the upper side many red branches were seen going from it to the extremities of
the leaf, which on the other side were not visible except by looking through it against
the light. On this under side a system of branching vessels carrying a pale milky fluid
were seen coming from the extremities of the leaf, and covering the whole underside of
it, and joining into two large veins, one on each side of the red artery in the middle rib
of the leaf, and along with it descending to the footstalk or petiole. On slitting one of
these leaves with scissars, and having a common magnifying lens ready, the milky blood
was seen oozing out of the returning veins on each side of the red artery in the middle
rib, but none of the red fluid from the artery.</P>
<P>All these appearances were more easily seen in a leaf of Picris treated in the same
manner; for in this milky plant the stems and middle rib of the leaves are sometimes
naturally coloured reddish, and hence the colour of the madder seemed to pass further
into the ramifications of their leaf-arteries, and was there beautifully visible with the
returning branches of milky veins on each side.</P>
<P>3. From these experiments the upper surface of the leaf appeared to be the immediate
organ of respiration, because the coloured fluid was carried to the extremities of the leaf
by vessels most conspicuous on the upper surface, and there changed into a milky fluid,
which is the blood of the plant, and then returned by concomitant veins on the under
surface, which were seen to ooze when divided with scissars, and which in Picris, parti∣cularly
render the under surface of the leaves greatly whiter than the upper one.</P>
<P>4. As the upper surface of leaves constitutes the organ of respiration, on which the
sap is exposed in the terminations of arteries beneath a thin pellicle to the action of the
atmosphere, these surfaces in many plants strongly repel moisture, as cabbage-leaves,
whence the particles of rain lying over their surfaces without touching them, as observed
by Mr. Melville (Essays Literary and Philosop. Edinburgh) have the appearance of glo∣bules
of quicksilver. And hence leaves laid with the upper surfaces on water, wither as
soon as in the dry air, but continue green many days, if placed with the under surfaces
on water, as appears in the experiments of Mons. Bonnet (Usage des Fevilles.) Hence
some aquatic plants, as the Water-lily (Nymphoea) have the lower sides of their leaves
floating on the water, while the upper surfaces remain dry in the air.</P>
<P>5. As those insects, which have many spiracula, or breathing apertures, as wasps
and flies, are immediately suffocated by pouring oil upon them, I carefully covered with
<PB N="103" REF="337"/>
oil the surfaces of several leaves of Phlomis, of Portugal Laurel, and Balsams, and though
it would not regularly adhere, I found them all die in a day or two.</P>
<P>Of aquatic leaves, see Note on Trapa and on Fucus, in Vol. II. to which must be added
that many leaves are furnished with muscles about their footstalks, to turn their upper
surfaces to the air or light, as Mimosa and Hedysarum gyrans. From all these analogies
I think there can be no doubt but that leaves of trees are their lungs, giving out a phlo∣gistic
material to the atmosphere, and absorbing oxygene or vital air.</P>
<P>6. The great use of light to vegetation would appear from this theory to be by disen∣gaging
vital air from the water which they perspire, and thence to facilitate its union
with their blood exposed beneath the thin surface of their leaves; since when pure air is
thus applied, it is probable, that it can be more readily absorbed. Hence in the curious
experiments of Dr. Priestley and Mr. Ingenhouze, some plants purified air less than
others, that is, they perspired less in the sunshine; and Mr. Scheele found that by putting
peas into water, which about half-covered them, that they converted the vital air into
fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, in the same manner as in animal respiration. See Note
XXXIV.</P>
<P>7. The circulation in the lungs or leaves of plants is very similar to that of fish. In
fish the blood after having passed through their gills does not return to the heart as from
the lungs of air-breathing animals, but the pulmonary vein taking the structure of an
artery after having received the blood from the gills, which there gains a more florrid
colour, distributes it to the other parts of their bodies. The same structure occurs in the
livers of fish, whence we see in those animals two circulations independent of the power
of the heart, viz. that beginning at the termination of the veins of the gills, and branching
through the muscles; and that which passes through the liver; both which are carried
on by the action of those respective arteries and veins. Monro's Physiology of Fish, p. 19.</P>
<P>The course of the fluids in the roots, leaves, and buds of vegetables seems to be per∣formed
in a manner similar to both these. First the absorbent vessels of the roots and
surfaces unite at the footstalk of the leaf; and then, like the Vena Portarum, an artery
commences without the intervention of a heart, and spreads the sap in its numerous rami∣fications
on the upper surface of the leaf; here it changes its colour and properties, and
becomes vegetable blood; and is again collected by a pulmonary vein on the under sur∣face
of the leaf. This vein, like that which receives the blood from the gills of fish,
assumes the office and name of an artery, and branching again disperses the blood up∣ward
to the bud from the footstalk of the leaf, and downward to the roots; where it is
all expended in the various secretions, the nourishment and growth of the plant, as fast as
it is prepared.</P>
<P>II. The organ of respiration already spoken of belongs particularly to the shoots or
buds, but there is another pulmonary system, perhaps totally independent of the green
foliage, which belongs to the fructification only, I mean the corol or petals. In this
there is an artery belonging to each petal, which conveys the vegetable blood to its ex∣tremities,
exposing it to the light and air under a delicate membrane covering the internal
surface of the petal, where it often changes its colour, as is beautifully seen in some party-coloured
<PB N="104" REF="338"/>
poppies; though it is probable some of the iridescent colours of flowers may be
owing to the different degrees of tenuity of the exterior membrane of the leaf refracting
the light like soap-bubbles, the vegetable blood is then returned by correspondent vege∣table
veins, exactly as in the green foliage; for the purposes of the important secretions
of honey, wax, the finer essential oil, and the prolific dust of the anthers.</P>
<P>1. The vascular structure of the corol as above described, and which is visible to the
naked eye, and its exposing the vegetable juices to the air and light during the day,
evinces that it is a pulmonary organ.</P>
<P>2. As the glands which produce the prolific dust of the anthers, the honey, wax, and
frequently some odoriferous essential oil, are generally attached to the corol, and always
fall off and perish with it, it is evident that the blood is elaborated or oxygenated in this
pulmonary system for the purpose of these important secretions.</P>
<P>3. Many flowers, as the Colchicum, and Hamamelis arise naked in autumn, no green
leaves appearing till the ensuing spring; and many others put forth their flowers and
complete their impregnation early in the spring before the green foliage appears, as
Mezereon, cherries, pears, which shews that these corols are the lungs belonging to the
fructification.</P>
<P>4. This organ does not seem to have been necessary for the defence of the stamens
and pistils, since the calyx of many flowers, as Tragopogon, performs this office; and in
many flowers these petals themselves are so tender as to require being shut up in the calyx
during the night, for what other use then can such an apparatus of vessels be designed?</P>
<P>5. In the Helleborus-niger, Christmas-rose, after the seeds are grown to a certain size,
the nectaries and stamens drop off, and the beautiful large white petals change their
colour to a deep green, and gradually thus become as calyx inclosing and defending the
ripening seeds, hence it would seem that the white vessels of the corol served the office of
exposing the blood to the action of the air, for the purposes of separating or producing
the honey, wax, and prolific dust, and when these were no longer wanted, that these
vessels coalesced like the placental vessels of animals after their birth, and thus ceased to
perform that office and lost at the same time their white colour. Why should they loose
their white colour, unless they at the same time lost some other property besides that of
defending the seed-vessel, which they still continue to defend?</P>
<P>6. From these observations I am led to doubt whether green leaves be absolutely
necessary to the progress of the fruit-bud after the last year's leaves are fallen off. The
green leaves serve as lungs to the shoots and foster the new buds in their bosoms,
whether these buds be leaf-buds or fruit-buds; but in the early spring the fruit-buds
expand their corols, which are their lungs, and seem no longer to require green leaves;
hence the vine bears fruit at one joint without leaves, and puts out a leaf-bud at another
joint without fruit. And I suppose the green leaves which rise out of the earth in the
spring from the Colchicum are for the purpose of producing the new bulb, and its pla∣centa,
and not for the giving maturity to the seed. When currant or goosberry trees
lose their leaves by the depredation of insects the fruit continues to be formed, though
less sweet and less in size.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="339"/>
7. From these facts it appears that the flower-bud after the corol falls off, (which is its
lungs,) and the stamens and nectary along with it, becomes simply an uterus for the
purpose of supplying the growing embryon with nourishment, together with a system
of absorbent vessels which bring the juices of the earth to the footstalk of the fruit,
and which there changes into an artery for the purpose of distributing the sap for the
secretion of the saccharine or farinaceous or acescent materials for the use of the
embryon. At the same time as all the vessels of the different buds of trees inosculate
or communicate with each other, the fruit becomes sweeter and larger when the green
leaves continue on the tree, but the mature flowers themselves, (the succeeding fruit
not considered) perhaps suffer little injury from the green leaves being taken off, as
some florists have observed.</P>
<P>8. That the vessels of different vegetable buds inosculate in various parts of their
circulation is rendered probable by the increased growth of one bud, when others in
its vicinity are cut away; as it thus seems to receive the nourishment which was before
divided amongst many.</P>

<Q><L>Love out their hour and leave their lives in air.</L> <BIBL><HI>CANTO IV.</HI> l. 456.</BIBL></Q>
<P>FROM the accurate experiments and observations of Spallanzani it appears that
in the Spartium Junceum, rush-broom, the very minute seeds were discerned in the pod
at least twenty days before the flower is in full bloom, that is twenty days before fecunda∣tion.
At this time also the powder of the anthers was visible, but glued fast to their sum∣mits.
The seeds however at this time, and for ten days after the blossom had fallen off,
appeared to consist of a gelatinous substance. On the eleventh day after the falling of the
blossom the seeds became heart-shape, with the basis attached by an appendage to the pod,
and a white point at the apex; this white point was on pressure found to be a cavity in∣cluding
a drop of liquor.</P>
<P>On the 25th day the cavity which at first appeared at the apex was much enlarged and
still full of liquor, it also contained a very small semi-transparent body, of a yellowish
colour, gelatinous, and fixed by its two opposite ends to the sides of the cavity.</P>
<P>In a month the seed was much enlarged and its shape changed from a heart to a
kidney, the little body contained in the cavity was increased in bulk and was less
transparent, and gelatinous, but there yet appeared no organization.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="340"/>
On the 40th day the cavity now grown larger was quite filled with the body, which
was covered with a thin membrane; after this membrane was removed the body appeared
of a bright green, and was easily divided by the point of a needle into two portions,
which manifestly formed the two lobes, and within these attached to the lower part the
exceedingly small plantule was easily perceived.</P>
<P>The foregoing observations evince, 1. That the seeds exist in the ovarium many
days before fecundation. 2. That they remain for some time solid, and then a cavity
containing a liquid is formed in them. 3. That after fecundation a body begins to
appear within the cavity fixed by two points to the sides, which in process of time proves
to be two lobes containing a plantule. 4. That the ripe seed consists of two lobes
adhering to a plantule, and surrounded by a thin membrane which is itself covered with
a husk or cuticle. Spalanzani's Dissertations, Vol. II. p. 253.</P>
<P>The analogy between seeds and eggs has long been observed, and is confirmed by the
mode of their production. The egg is known to be formed within the hen long before
its impregnation; C. F. Wolf asserts that the yolk or the egg is nourished by the vessels
of the mother, and that it has from those its arterial and venous branches, but that after
impregnation these vessels gradually become impervious and obliterated, and that new
ones are produced from the fetus and dispersed into the yolk. Haller's Physiolog.
Tom. VIII. p. 94. The young seed after fecundation, I suppose, is nourished in a
similar manner from the gelatinous liquor, which is previously deposited for that purpose;
the uterus of the plant producing or secreting it into a reservoir or amnios in which the
embryon is lodged, and that the young embryon is furnished with vessels to absorb a
part of it, as in the very early embryon in the animal uterus.</P>
<P>The spawn of frogs and of fish is delivered from the female before its impregnation.
M. Bonnet says that the male salamander darts his semen into the water, where it
forms a little whitish cloud which is afterwards received by the swoln anus of the
female, and she is fecundated.—He adds that marine plants approach near to these ani∣mals,
as the male does not project a fine powder but a liquor which in like manner forms
a little cloud in the water.—And further adds, who knows but the powder of the stamina
of certain plants may not make some impression on certain germs belonging to the ani∣mal
kingdom! Letter XLIII. to Spalanzani, Oevres Philos.</P>
<P>Spalanzani found that the seminal fluid of frogs and dogs even when diluted with
much water retained its prolific quality. Whether this quality be simply a stimulus
exciting the egg into animal action, which may be called a vivifying principle, or whether
part of it be actually conjoined with the egg is not yet determined, though the latter
seems more probable from the frequent resemblance of the fetus to the male parent. A
conjunction however of both the male and female influence seems necessary for the
purpose of reproduction throughout all organized nature, as well in hermaphrodite
insects, microscopic animals, and polypi, and exists as well in the formation of the
buds of vegetables as in the production of their seeds, which is ingeniously conceived
and explained by Linneus. After having compared the flower to the larva of a butterfly,
<PB N="107" REF="341"/>
consisting of petals instead of wings, calyxes instead of wing-sheaths, with the organs of
reproduction, and having shewn the use of the farina in fecundating the egg or seed,
he proceeds to explain the production of the bud. The calyx of a flower, he says, is
an expansion of the outer bark, the petals proceed from the inner bark or rind, the
stamens from the alburnum or woody circle, and the style from the pith. In the pro∣duction
and impregnation of the seed a commixture of the secretions of the stamens and
style are necessary; and for the production of a bud he thinks the medulla or pith bursts
its integuments and mixes with the woody part or alburnum, and these forcing their
passage through the rind and bark constitute the bud or viviparous progeny of the
vegetable. System of Vegetables translated from Linneus, p. 8.</P>
<P>It has been supposed that the embryon vegetable after fecundation, by its living
activity or stimulus exerted on the vessels of the parent plant, may produce the fruit or
seed-lobes, as the animal fetus produces its placenta, and as vegetable buds may be
supposed to produce their umbilical vessels or roots down the bark of the tree. This in
respect to the production of the fruit surrounding the seeds of trees has been assimilated
to the gall-nuts on oak-leaves, and to the bedeguar on briars, but there is a powerful
objection to this doctrine, viz. that the fruit of figs, all which are female in this country,
grow nearly as large without fecundation, and therefore the embryon has in them no
self-living principle.</P>

<P>THE glands of vegetables which separate from their blood the mucilage, starch, or
sugar for the placentation or support of their seeds, bulbs, and buds; or those which
deposit their bitter, acrid, or narcotic juices for their defence from depredations of
infects or larger animals; or those which secrete resins or wax for their protection from
moisture or frosts, consist of vessels too fine for the injection or absorption of coloured
fluids, and have not therefore yet been exhibited to the inspection even of our glasses,
and can therefore only be known by their effects, but one of the most curious and im∣portant
of all vegetable secretions, that of honey, is apparent to our naked eyes, though
before the discoveries of Linneus the nectary or honey-gland had not even acquired a
name.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="342"/>
The odoriferous essential oils of several flowers seem to have been designed for their
defence against the depredations of insects, while their beautiful colours were a necessary
consequence of the size of the particles of their blood, or of the tenuity of the exterior
membrane of the petal. The use of the prolific dust is now well ascertained, the wax
which covers the anthers prevents this dust from receiving moisture, which would make
it burst prematurely and thence prevent its application to the stigma, as sometimes
happens in moist years and is the cause of deficient fecundation both of our fields and
orchards.</P>
<P>The universality of the production of honey in the vegetable world, and the very
complicated apparatus which nature has constructed in many flowers, as well as the
acrid or deleterious juices she has furnished those flowers with (as in the Aconite) to
protect this honey from rain and from the depredations of insects, seem to imply that
this fluid is of very great importance in the vegetable economy; and also that it was
necessary to expose it to the open air previous to its reabsorption into the vegetable
vessels.</P>
<P>In the animal system the lachrymal gland separates its fluid into the open air for the
purpose of moistening the eye, of this fluid the part which does not exhale is absorbed
by the puncta lachrymalia and carried into the nostrils; but as this is not a nutritive
fluid the analogy goes no further than its secretion into the open air and its reabsorption
into the system; every other secreted fluid in the animal body is in part absorbed again
into the system, even those which are esteemed excrementitious, as the urine and
perspirable matter, of which the latter is secreted, like the honey, into the external air.
That the honey is a nutritious fluid, perhaps the most so of any vegetable production,
appears from its great similarity to sugar, and from its affording sustenance to such
numbers of insects, which live upon it solely during summer, and lay it up for their
winter provision. These proofs of its nutritive nature evince the necessity of its re∣absorption
into the vegetable system for some useful purpose.</P>
<P>This purpose however has as yet escaped the researches of philosophical botanists.
M. Pontedera believes it designed to lubricate the vegetable uterus, and compares the
horn-like nectaries of some flowers to the appendicle of the caecum intestinum of animals.
Antholog. p. 49.) Others have supposed that the honey, when reabsorbed, might
serve the purpose of the liquor amnii, or white of the egg, as a nutriment for the young
embryon or fecundated seed in its early state of existence. But as the nectary is found
equally general in male flowers as in female ones; and as the young embryon or seed
grows before the petals and nectary are expanded, and after they fall off; and, thirdly,
as the nectary so soon falls off after the fecundation of the pistillum; these seem to be
insurmountable objections to both the above-mentioned opinions.</P>
<P>In this state of uncertainty conjectures may be of use so far as they lead to further
experiment and investigation. In many tribes of insects, as the silk-worm, and perhaps
in all the moths and butterflies, the male and female parents die as soon as the eggs are
<PB N="109" REF="343"/>
impregnated and excluded; the eggs remaining to be perfected and hatched at some
future time. The same thing happens in regard to the male and female parts of flowers;
the anthers and filaments, which constitute the male parts of the flower, and the stigma
and style, which constitute the female part of the flower, fall off and die as soon as the
seeds are impregnated, and along with these the petals and nectary. Now the moths and
butterflies above-mentioned, as soon as they acquire the passion and the apparatus for
the reproduction of their species, loose the power of feeding upon leaves as they did
before, and become nourished by what?—by honey alone.</P>
<P>Hence we acquire a strong analogy for the use of the nectary or secretion of honey
in the vegetable economy, which is, that the male parts of flowers, and the female parts,
as soon as they leave their fetus-state, expanding their petals, (which constitute their
lungs,) become sensible to the passion, and gain the apparatus for the reproduction of
their species, and are fed and nourished with honey like the insects above described;
and that hence the nectary begins its office of producing honey, and dies or ceases to
produce honey at the same time with the birth and death of the stamens and the pistils;
which, whether existing in the same or in different flowers, are separate and distinct
animated beings.</P>
<P>Previous to this time the anthers with their filaments, and the stigmas with their
styles, are in their fetus-state sustained by their placental vessels, like the unexpanded
leaf-bud; with the seeds existing in the vegetable womb yet unimpregnated, and the
dust yet unripe in the cells of the anthers. After this period they expand their petals,
which have been shewn above to constitute the lungs of the flower; the placental
vessels, which before nourished the anthers and the stigmas, coalesce or cease to nourish
them; and they now acquire blood more oxygenated by the air, obtain the passion and
power of reproduction, are sensible to heat, and cold, and moisture, and to mechanic
stimulus, and become in reality insects fed with honey, similar in every respect except
their being attached to the tree on which they were produced.</P>
<P>Some experiments I have made this summer by cutting out the nectaries of several
flowers of the aconites before the petals were open, or had become much coloured, some
of these flowers near the summit of the plants produced no seeds, others lower down
produced seeds; but they were not sufficiently guarded from the farina of the flowers in
their vicinity; nor have I had opportunity to try if these seeds would vegetate.</P>
<P>I am acquainted with a philosopher, who contemplating this subject thinks it not
impossible, that the first insects were the anthers or stigmas of flowers; which had-by
some means loosed themselves from their parent plant, like the male flowers of Vallisneria;
and that many other insects have gradually in long process of time been formed
from these; some acquiring wings, others fins, and others claws, from their ceaseless
efforts to procure their food, or to secure themselves from injury. He contends, that
none of these changes are more incomprehensible than the transformation of tadpoles
into frogs, and caterpillars into butterflies.</P>
<P>There are parts of animal bodies, which do not require oxygenated blood for the
purpose of their secretions, as the liver; which for the production of bile takes its blood
<PB N="110" REF="344"/>
from the mesenteric veins, after it must have lost the whole or a great part of its oxyge∣nation,
which it had acquired in its passage through the lungs. In like manner the
pericarpium, or womb of the flower, continues to secrete its proper juices for the present
nourishment of the newly animated embryon-seed; and the saccharine, acescent, or
starchy matter of the fruit or seed-lobes for its future growth; in the same manner as
these things went on before fecundation; that is, without any circulation of juices in the
petals, or production of honey in the nectary; these having perished and fallen off with
the male and female apparatus for impregnation.</P>
<P>It is probable that the depredations of insects on this nutritious fluid must be injurious
to the products of vegetation, and would be much more so, but that the plants have
either acquired means to defend their honey in part, or have learned to make more than
is absolutely necessary for their own economy. In the same manner the honey-dew on
trees is very injurions to them; in which disease the nutritive fluid, the vegetable-sap-juice,
seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics, as in
the sweating sickness of the last century. To prevent the depredation of insects on honey
a wealthy man in Italy is said to have poisoned his neighbour's bees perhaps by mixing
arsnic with honey, against which there is a most flowery declamation in Quintilian.
No. XIII. As the use of the wax is to preserve the dust of the anthers from moisture,
which would prematurely burst them, the bees which collect this for the construction of
the combs or cells, must on this account also injure the vegetation of a country where
they too much abound.</P>
<P>It is not easy to conjecture why it was necessary that this secretion of honey should be
exposed to the open air in the nectary or honey-cup, for which purpose of great an
apparatus for its defence from insects and from showers became necessary. This diffi∣culty
increases when we recollect that the sugar in the joints of grass, in the sugar-cane,
and in the roots of beets, and in ripe fruits is produced without the exposure to the
air. On supposition of its serving for nutriment to the anthers and stigmas it may thus
acquire greater oxygenation for the purpose of producing greater powers of sensibility, ac∣cording
to a doctrine lately advanced by a French philosopher, who has endeavoured to
shew that the oxygene, or base of vital air, is the constituent principle of our power of
sensibility.</P>
<P>From this provision of honey for the male and female parts of flowers, and from
the provision of sugar, starch, oil, and mucilage, in the fruits, seed-cotyledons, roots, and
buds of plants laid up for the nutriment of the expanding fetus, not only a very
numerous class of insects, but a great part of the larger animals procure their food; and
thus enjoy life and pleasure without producing pain to others, for these seeds or eggs
with the nutriment laid up in them are not yet endued with sensitive life.</P>
<P>The secretions from various vegetable glands hardened in the air produce gums,
resins, and various kinds of saccharine, saponaceous, and wax-like substances, as the
gum of cherry or plumb-trees, gum tragacanth from the astragalus tragacantha, camphor
from the laurus camphora, elemi from amyris elemifera, aneme from hymenoea courbaril,
turpentine from pistacia terebinthus, balsam of Mecca from the buds of amyris opobal∣samum,
<PB N="111" REF="345"/>
branches of which are placed in the temples of the East on account of their
fragrance, the wood is called xylobalsamum, and the fruit carpobalsamum; aloe from a
plant of the same name; myrrh from a plant not yet described; the remarkably elastic
resin is brought into Europe principally in the form of flasks, which look like black leather,
and are wonderfully elastic, and not penetrable by water, rectified ether dissolves it; its
flexibility is encreased by warmth and destroyed by cold; the tree which yields this juice
is the jatropha elastica, it grows in Guaiana and the neighbouring tracts of America;
its juice is said to resemble wax in becoming soft by heat, but that it acquires no elasticity
till that property is communicated to it by a secret art, after which it is poured into
moulds and well dried and can no longer be rendered fluid by heat. Mr. de la Borde
physician at Cayenne has given this account. Manna is obtained at Naples from the
fraxinus ornus, or manna-ash, it partly issues spontaneously, which is preferred, and
partly exsudes from wounds made purposely in the month of August, many other
plants yield manna more sparingly; sugar is properly made from the saccharum officinale,
or sugar-cane, but is found in the roots of beet and many other plants; American wax
is obtained from the myrica cerifera, candle-berry myrtle, the berries are boiled in water
and a green wax separates, with luke warm water the wax is yellow: the seed of croton
sebiferum are lodged in tallow; there are many other vegetable exsudations used in the
various arts of dyeing, varnishing, tanning, lacquering, and which supply the shop of
the druggist with medicines and with poisons.</P>
<P>There is another analogy, which would seem to associate plants with animals, and
which perhaps belongs to this Note on Glandulation, I mean the similarity of their
digestive powers. In the roots of growing vegetables, as in the process of making malt,
the farinaceous part of the seed is converted into sugar by the vegetable power of
digestion in the same manner as the farinaceous matter of seeds are converted into sweet
chyle by the animal digestion. The sap-juice which rises in the vernal months from the
roots of trees through the alburnum or sap-wood, owes its sweetness I suppose to a
similar digestive power of the absorbent system of the young buds. This exists in many
vegetables in great abundance as in vines, sycamore, birch, and most abundantly in the
palm-tree, (Isert's Voyage to Guinea,) and seems to be a similar fluid in all plants, as
chyle is similar in all animals.</P>
<P>Hence as the digested food of vegetables consists principally of sugar, and from that
is produced again their mucilage, starch, and oil, and since animals are sustained by
these vegetable productions, it would seem that the sugar-making process carried on in
vegetable vessels was the great source of life to all organized beings. And that if our
improved chemistry should ever discover the art of making sugar from fossile or aerial
matter without the assistance of vegetation, food for animals would then become as
plentiful as water, and mankind might live upon the earth as thick as blades of grass,
with no restraint to their numbers but the want of local room.</P>
<P>It would seem that roots fixed in the earth, and leaves innumerable waving in the
air were necessary forthe decomposition of water, and the conversion of it into saccharine
<PB N="112" REF="346"/>
matter, which would have been not only cumberous but totally incompatible with the
locomotion of animal bodies. For how could a man or quadruped have carried on his
head or back a forest of leaves, or have had long branching lacteal or absorbent vessels
terminating in the earth? Animals therefore subsist on vegetables; that is, they take
the matter so far prepared, and have organs to prepare it further for the purposes of
higher animation, and greater sensibility. In the same manner the apparatus of green
leaves and long roots were found inconvenient for the more animated and sensitive parts
of vegetable-flowers, I mean the anthers and stigmas, which are therefore separate beings,
endued with the passion and power of reproduction, with lungs of their own, and fed with
honey, a food ready prepared by the long roots and green leaves of the plant, and pre∣sented
to their absorbent mouths.</P>
<P>From this outline a philosopher may catch a glimpse of the general economy of na∣ture;
and like the mariner cast upon an unknown shore, who rejoiced when he saw the
print of a human foot upon the sand, he may cry out with rapture, "A GOD DWELLS
HERE."</P>

<HEAD>The following is an Addition to the Note on Coal, No. XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this account of the production of coals from morasses it would appear,
that coal-beds are not to be expected beneath masses of lime-stone. Nevertheless I have
been lately informed by my friend Mr. Michell of Thornhill, who I hope will soon favour
the public with his geological investigations, that the beds of chalk are the uppermost of
all the limestones; and that they rest on the granulated limestone, called ketton-stone;
which I suppose is similar to that which covers the whole country from Leadenham to
Sleaford, and from Sleaford to Lincoln; and that, thirdly, coal-delphs are frequently
found beneath these two uppermost beds of limestone.</P>
<P>Now as the beds of chalk and of granulated limestone may have been formed by
alluviation, on or beneath the shores of the sea, or in vallies of the land; it would seem,
that some coal countries, which in the great commotions of the earth had been sunk
beneath the water, were thus covered with alluvial limestone, as well as others with
alluvial basaltes, or common gravel-beds. Very extensive plains which now consist of
alluvial materials, were in the early times covered with water; which has since diminished,
as the solid parts of the earth have increased. For the solid parts of the earth consisting
chiefly of animal and vegetable recrements must have originally been formed or pro∣duced
from the water by animal and vegetable processes; and as the solid parts of the
earth may be supposed to be thrice as heavy as water, it follows that thrice the quantity
of water must have vanished compared with the quantity of earth thus produced. This
may account for many immense beds of alluvial materials, as gravel, rounded sand,
granulated limestone, and chalk, covering such extensive plains as Lincoln-heath, having
become dry without the supposition of their having been again elevated from the ocean.
At the same time we acquire the knowledge of one of the uses or final causes of the
organized world, not indeed very flattering to our vanity, that it converts water into
earth, forming islands and continents by its recrements or exuviae.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES OMITTED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Expiring groans,</HI> p. 98. l. 451. Mr. Savery or Mr. Volney in their Travels through
Egypt has given a curious description of one of the pyramids, with the operose method
of closing them, and immuring the body, (as they supposed) for six thousand years.
And has endeavoured from thence to shew, that, when a monarch died, several of his
favourite courtiers were inclosed alive with the mummy in these great masses of stone-work;
and had food and water conveyed to them, as long as they lived, proper apertures
being left for this purpose, and for the admission of air, and for the exclusion of any thing offensive.</P>
<P><HI>Unfolds his larva-form.</HI> p. 197. l. 458. The flower bursts forth from its larva, the
herb, naked and perfect like a butterfly from its chrysolis; winged with its corol;
wing-sheathed by its calyx; consisting alone of the organs of reproduction. The males,
or stamens, have their anthers replete with a prolific powder containing the vivifying
fovilla: in the females, or pistils, exists the ovary, terminated by the tubular stigma.
When the anthers burst and shed their bags of dust, the male fovilla is received by the pro∣lific
lymph of the stigma, and produces the seed or egg, which is nourished in the ovary.
System of Vegetables translated from Linneus by the Lichfield Society, p. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Wound them ye Sylphs!</HI> p. 198. 1. 463. It is customary to debark oak-trees in the
spring, which are intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn; because the bark comes
off easier at this season, and the sap-wood, or alburnum, is believed to become harder
and more durable, if the tree remains till the end of summer. The trees thus stripped of
their bark put forth shoots as usual with acorns on the 6th 7th and 8th joint, like vines;
but in the branches I examined, the joints of the debarked trees were much shorter than
those of other oak-trees; the acorns were more numerous; and no new buds were pro∣duced
above the joints which bore acorns. From hence it appears that the branches of
debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds, and more flower-buds, which last circum∣stance
I suppose must depend on their being sooner or later debarked in the vernal
months. And, secondly, that the new buds of debarked oak-trees continue to obtain
moisture from the alburnum after the season of the ascent of sap in other vegetables
ceases; which in this unnatural state of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes,
like the alburnum of the small debarked cylinder of a pear-tree abovementioned; or may
continue to act as placental vessels, as happens to the animal embryon in cases of super∣fetation;
when the fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its usual time,
of which some instances have been recorded, the placenta continues to supply perhaps
the double office both of nutrition and of respiration.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="349"/>
<HI>With new prolific power.</HI> p. 199. l. 467. About Midsummer the new buds are
formed, but it is believed by some of the Linnean school, that these buds may in their
early state be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds according to the vigour of
the vegetating branch. Thus if the upper part of a branch be cut away, the buds near
the extremity of the remaining stem, having a greater proportional supply of nutriment,
or possessing a greater facility of shooting their roots, or absorbent vessels, down the bark,
will become leaf-buds, which might otherwise have been flower-buds. And the con∣trary
as explained in note on l. 463. of this Canto.</P>
<P><HI>Closed in the style.</HI> p. 199. l. 469. <Q><P>I conceive the medulla of a plant to consist of a
bundle of nervous fibres, and that the propelling vital power separates their uppermost
extremities. These, diverging, penetrate the bark, which is now gelatinous, and become
multiplied in the new gem, or leaf-bud. The ascending vessels of the bark being thus
divided by the nervous fibres, which perforate it, and the ascent of its fluids being thus
impeded, the bark is extended into a leaf. But the flower is produced, when the pro∣trusion
of the medulla is greater than the retention of the including cortical part; whence
the substance of the bark is expanded in the calyx; that of the rind, (or interior bark,)
in the corol; that of the wood in the stamens, that of the medulla in the pistil. Vege∣tation
thus terminates in the production of new life, the ultimate medullary and cortical
fibres being collected in the seeds.</P> <BIBL>Linnei Systema Veget. p. 6. edit, 14.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><HI>Diana's trees,</HI> p. 206. l. 552. The chemists and astronomers from the earliest antiquity
have used the same characters to represent the metals and the planets, which were most
probably outlines or abstracts of the original hieroglyphic figures of Egypt. These
afterwards acquired niches in their temples, and represented Gods as well as metals and
planets; whence silver is called Diana, or the moon, in the books of alchemy.</P>
<P>The process for making Diana's silver tree is thus described by Lemeri. Dissolve
one ounce of pure silver in acid of nitre very pure and moderately strong; mix this
solution with about twenty ounces of distilled water; add to this two ounces of mercury,
and let it remain at rest. In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree
of silver with branches imitating vegetation.</P>
<P>1. As the mercury has a greater affinity than silver with the nitrous acid, the silver
becomes precipitated; and, being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury, sinks
down in its metallic form and lustre. 2. The attraction between silver and mercury,
which causes them readily to amalgamate together, occasions the precipitated silver to
adhere to the surface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the vessel. 3. The
attraction of the particles of the precipitated silver to each other causes the beginning
branches to thicken and elongate into trees and shrubs rooted on the mercury. For
other circumstances concerning this beautiful experiment see Mr. Keir's Chemical
Dictionary, art. Arbor Dianae; a work perhaps of greater utility to mankind than the
lost Alexandrian Library; the continuation of which is so eagerly expected by all, who
are occupied in the arts, or attached to the sciences.</P>

luminous trains, occasioned by an electric spark passing between the aerial and inflam∣mable
strata of the atmosphere, and mixing them and setting them on fire in its passage;
attracted by volcanic eruptions; one thousand miles through such a medium resists less
than the tenth of an inch of glass. 4. Northern lights not attracted to a point but dif∣fused;
their colours; passage of electric fire in vacuo dubious; Dr. Franklin's theory of

steam and form rain. 1. Cold the principal cause of devaporation; hence the steam
dissolved in heat is precipitated, but that dissolved in air remains even in frosts; south-west
wind. 2. North-east winds mixing with south-west winds produce rain; because
the cold particles of air of the north-east acquire some of the matter of heat from the
south-west winds. 3. Devaporation from mechanical expansion of air, as in the receiver
of an air-pump; summer-clouds appear and vanish; when the barometers sink without
change of wind the weather becomes colder. 4. Solution of water in electric fluid
dubious. 5. Barometer sinks from the lessened gravity of the air, and from the rain
having less pressure as it falls; a mixture of a solution of water in calorique with an
aerial solution of water is lighter than dry air; breath of animals in cold weather why
condensed into visible vapour and dissolved again.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXVI.....SPRINGS.</HEAD>
<P>LOWEST strata of the earth appear on the highest hills; springs from dews sliding
between them; mountains are colder than plains; 1. from their being insulated in the
air; 2. from their enlarged surface; 3. from the rarety of the air it becomes a better
conductor of heat; 4. by the air on mountains being mechanically rarefied as it ascends;
5. gravitation of the matter of heat; 6. the dashing of clouds against hills; of fogs
against trees; springs stronger in hot days with cold nights; streams from subterranean
caverns; from beneath the snow on the Alps.</P>

<P>AIR is perpetually subject to increase and to diminution; Oxygene is perpetually pro∣duced

Azote is perpetually produced from animal and vegetable putrefaction, or combustion;
from springs of water; volatile alcali; fixed alcali; sea-water; the y are both perpetually
diminished by their contact with the soil, producing nitre; Oxygene is diminished in the
production of all acids; Azote by the growth of animal bodies; charcoal in burning
consumes double its weight of pure air; every barrel of red-lead absorbes 2000 cubic
feet of vital air; air obtained from variety of substances by Dr. Priestley; Officina aeris
in the polar circle, and at the Line. <HI>South-west winds;</HI> their westerly direction from the
less velocity of the earth's surface; the contrary in respect to north-east winds; South-west
winds consist of regions of air from the south; and north-east winds of regions
of air from the north; when the south-west prevails for weeks and the barometer sinks
to 28, what becomes of above one fifteenth part of the atmosphere; 1. It is not carried
back by superior currents; 2. Not from its loss of moisture; 3. Not carried over the
pole; 4. Not owing to atmospheric tides or mountains; 5. It is absorbed at the polar
circle; hence south-west winds and rain; south-west sometimes cold. <HI>North-east winds</HI>
consist of air from the north; cold by the evaporation of ice; are dry winds; 1. Not sup∣plied
<PB N="124" REF="357"/>
by superior currents; 2. The whole atmosphere increased in quantity by air set at
liberty from its combinations in the polar circles. <HI>South-east winds</HI> consist of north
winds driven back. <HI>North-west winds</HI> consist of south-west winds driven back; north-west
winds of America bring frost; owing to a vertical spiral eddy of air between the
eastern coast and the Apalachian mountains; hence the greater cold of North America.
<HI>Trade-winds;</HI> air over the Line always hotter than at the tropics; trade-winds gain their
easterly direction from the greater velocity of the earth's surface at the line; not supplied
by superior currents; supplied by decomposed water in the sun's great light; 1. Because
there are no constant rains in the tract of the trade-winds; 2. Because there is no con∣densible
vapour above three or four miles high at the line. <HI>Monsoons and tornadoes;</HI>
some places at the tropic become warmer when the sun is vertical than at the line; hence
the air ascends, supplied on one side by the north-east winds, and on the other by the
south-west; whence an ascending eddy or tornado, raising water from the sea, or sand
from the desert, and incessant rains; air diminished to the northward produces south-west
winds; tornadoes from heavier air above sinking through lighter air below, which
rises through a perforation; hence trees are thrown down in a narrow line of twenty or
forty yards broad, the sea rises like a cone, with great rain and lightning. <HI>Land and sea

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE general design of the following sheets is to inlist Imagination
under the banner of Science, and to lead her votaries from the
looser analogies, which dress out the imagery of poetry, to the
stricter ones, which form the ratiocination of philosophy. While
their particular design is to induce the ingenious to cultivate the
knowledge of BOTANY; by introducing them to the vestibule of that
delightful science, and recommending to their attention the immortal
works of the Swedish Naturalist LINNEUS.</P>
<P>In the first Poem, or Economy of Vegetation, the physiology of
Plants is delivered; and the operation of the Elements, as far as they
may be supposed to affect the growth of Vegetables. But the pub∣lication
of this part is deferred to another year, for the purpose of
repeating some experiments on vegetation, mentioned in the notes.
In the second poem, or LOVES OF THE PLANTS, which is here pre∣sented
to the Reader, the Sexual System of LINNEUS is explained,
with the remarkable properties of many particular plants.</P>
<P>The author has withheld this work, (excepting a few pages) many
years from the press, according to the rule of Horace, hoping to
have rendered it more worthy the acceptance of the public,—but
finds at length, that he is less able, from disuse, to correct the
poetry; and, from want of leizure, to amplify the annotations.</P>
<P>In this second edition, the plants Amaryllis, Orchis, and Cannabis
are inserted with two additional prints of flowers; some alterations
are made in Gloriosa, and Tulipa; and the description of the Salt∣mines
in Poland is removed to the first poem on the Economy of
Vegetation.</P>

<PB REF="366"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>LINNEUS has divided the vegetable world into 24 Classes;
these Classes into about 120 Orders; these Orders contain
about 2000 Families, or Genera; and these Families about 20,000
Species; besides the innumerable Varieties, which the accidents of
climate or cultivation have added to these Species.</P>
<P>The Classes are distinguished from each other in this ingenious
system, by the number, situation, adhesion, or reciprocal proportion
of the males in each flower. The Orders, in many of these Classes,
are distinguished by the number, or other circumstances of the females.
The Families, or Genera, are characterized by the analogy of all the
parts of the flower or fructification. The Species are distinguished
by the foliage of the plant; and the Varieties by any accidental cir∣cumstance
of colour, taste, or odour; the seeds of these do not al∣ways
produce plants similar to the parent; as in our numerous fruit-trees
and garden flowers; which are propagated by grafts or layers.</P>
<P>The first eleven Classes include the plants, in whose flowers both
the sexes reside; and in which the Males or Stamens are neither
united, nor unequal in height when at maturity; and are therefore
distinguished from each other simply by the number of males in each
flower, as is seen in the annexed PLATE, copied from the Dictionaire
Botanique of M. BULLIARD, in which the numbers of each division
refer to the Botanic Classes.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><PB N="iv" REF="367"/>
CLASS I. ONE MALE, <HI>Monandria;</HI> includes the plants which posses but One Stamen in each flower.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Two MALES, <HI>Diandria.</HI> Two Stamens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. THREE MALES, <HI>Triandria.</HI> Three Stamens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. FOUR MALES, <HI>Tetrandria.</HI> Four Stamens.</ITEM>

<ITEM>XI. TWELVE MALES, <HI>Dodecandria.</HI> Twelve Stamens.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The next two Classes are distinguished not only by the number
of equal and disunited males, as in the above eleven Classes, but re∣quire
an additional circumstance to be attended to, <HI>viz.</HI> whether the
males or stamens be situated on the calyx, or not.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>XII. TWENTY MALES, <HI>Icosandria.</HI> Twenty Stamens inserted
on the calyx or flower-cup; as is well seen in the last Figure of No.
xii. in the annexed Plate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIII. MANY MALES, <HI>Polyandria.</HI> From 20 to 100 Stamens,
which do not adhere to the calyx; as is well seen in the first Figure
of No. xiii. in the annexed Plate.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In the next two Classes, not only the number of stamens are to be
observed, but the reciprocal proportions in respect to height.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>XIV. Two POWERS, <HI>Didynamia.</HI> Four Stamens, of which two
are lower than the other two; as is seen in the two first Figures of
No. xiv.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XV. FOUR POWERS, <HI>Tetradynamia.</HI> Six Stamens; of which
four are taller, and the two lower ones opposite to each other; as is
seen in the third Figure of the upper row in No. 15.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="v" REF="368"/>
The five subsequent Classes are distinguished not by the number
of the males, or stamens, but by their union or adhesion, either by
their anthers, or filaments, or to the female or pistil.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>XVI. ONE BROTHERHOOD, <HI>Monadelphia.</HI> Many Stamens united
by their filaments into one company; as in the second Figure below
of No. xvi.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVII. Two BROTHERHOODS, <HI>Diadelphia.</HI> Many Stamens united
by their filaments into two Companies; as in the uppermost Fig,
No. xvii.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XVIII. MANY BROTHERHOODS, <HI>Polyadelphia.</HI> Many Stamens
united by their filaments into three or more companies, as in No.
xviii.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XIX. CONFEDERATE MALES, <HI>Syngenesia.</HI> Many Stamens united
by their anthers; as in first and second Figures, No. xix.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XX. FEMININE MALES, <HI>Gynandria.</HI> Many Stamens attached
to the pistil.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The next three Classes consist of plants, whose flowers contain but
one of the sexes; or if some of them contain both sexes, there are
other flowers accompanying them of but one sex.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>XXI. ONE HOUSE, <HI>Monoecia.</HI> Male flowers and female flowers
separate, but on the same plant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXII. Two HOUSES, <HI>Dioecia.</HI> Male flowers and female flowers
separate, on different plants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XXIII. POLYGAMY, <HI>Polygamia.</HI> Male and female flowers on
one or more plants, which have at the same time flowers of both sexes.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The last Class contains the plants whose flowers are not discernible.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>XXIV. CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, <HI>Cryptogamia.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="369"/>
The Orders of the first thirteen Classes are founded on the number
of Females, or Pistils, and distinguished by the names, ONE FEMALE,
<HI>Monogynia.</HI> Two FEMALES, <HI>Digynia.</HI> THREE FEMALES, <HI>Trigynia.
&amp;c.</HI> as is seen in No. 1. which represents a plant of one male, one
female; and in the first Figure of No. xi. which represents a flower
with twelve males, and three females; (for, where the pistils have
no apparent styles, the summits, or stigmas, are to be numbered) and
in the first Figure of No. xii. which represents a flower with twenty
males and many females; and in the last Figure of the same No.
which has twenty males and one female; and in No. xiii. which
represents a flower with many males and many females.</P>
<P>The Class of Two POWERS, is divided into two natural Orders;
into such as have their seeds naked at the bottom of the calyx, or
flower cup; and such as have their seeds covered; as is seen in No.
xiv. Fig. 3. and 5.</P>
<P>The Class of FOUR POWERS, is divided also into two Orders; in
one of these the seeds are inclosed in a silicule, as in <HI>Shepherd's purse.</HI>
No. xiv. Fig. 5. In the other they are inclosed in a silique, as in
<HI>Wall-flower.</HI> Fig. 4.</P>
<P>In all the other Classes, excepting the Classes Confederate Males,
and Clandestine Marriage, as the character of each Class is distin∣guished
by the situations of the males; the character of the Orders
is marked by the numbers of them. In the Class ONE BROTHER∣HOOD,
No. xvi. Fig. 3. the Order of ten males is represented. And
in the Class Two BROTHERHOODS, No. xvii. Fig. 2. the Order
ten males is represented.</P>
<P>In the Class CONFEDERATE MALES, the Orders are chiefly dis∣tinguished
by the fertility or barrenness of the florets of the disk, or
ray of the compound flower.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="370"/>
And in the Class of CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE, the four Orders
are termed FFRNS, MOSSES, FLAGS, and FUNGUSSES.</P>
<P>The Orders are again divided into Genera, or Families, which are
all natural associations, and are described from the general resemblances
of the parts of fructification, in respect to their number, form, situa∣tion,
and reciprocal proportion. These are the Calyx, or Flower∣cup,
as seen in No. iv. Fig. 1. No. x. Fig. 1. and 3. No. xiv. Fig.
1. 2. 3. 4. Second, the Corol, or Blossom, as seen in No. i. ii. &amp;c.
Third, the Males, or Stamens; as in No. iv. Fig. 1. and No. viii.
Fig. 1. Fourth, the Females, or Pistils; as in No. i. No. xii. Fig.
1. No. xiv. Fig. 3. No. xv. Fig. 3. Fifth, the Pericarp or Fruit∣vessel;
as No. xv. Fig. 4. 5. No. xvii. Fig. 2. Sixth, the Seeds.</P>
<P>The illustrious author of the Sexual System of Botany, in his pre∣face
to his account of the Natural Orders, ingeniously imagines, that
one plant of each Natural Order was created in the beginning; and
that the intermarriages of these produced one plant of every Genus,
or Family; and that the intermarriages of these Generic, or Family
plants, produced all the Species: and lastly, that the intermarriages
of the individuals of the Species produced the Varieties.</P>
<P>In the following POEM, the name or number of the Class or
Order of each plant is printed in italics; as "<HI>Two</HI> brother swains."
"<HI>One</HI> House contains them." and the word "<HI>secret.</HI>" expresses the
Class of Clandestine Marriage.</P>
<P>The Reader, who wishes to become further acquainted with this
delightful field of science, is advised to study the words of the Great
Master, and is apprized that they are exactly and literally translated
into English, by a Society at LICHFIELD, in four Volumes Octavo.</P>

I have lately observed a very singular cir∣cumstance in this flower; the two males stand widely diverging from each other, and the female bends herself into contact first with one of them, and after some time leaves this, and applies herself to the other. It is probable one of the anthers may be mature before the other? See note on Gloriosa, and Genista. The females in Nigella, devil in the bush, are very tall compared to the males; and bending over in a circle to them, give the flower some resemblance to a regal crown. The female of the epilobium angustifolium, rose bay willow herb, bends down amongst the males for several days, and becomes up∣right again when impregnated.</P></NOTE></L>

The males are generally united at the bottom in two sets, whence Linneus has named the class "two brotherhoods." In the Genista, however, they are united in but one set. The flowers of this class are called papilionaccous, from their resemblance to a butterfly, as the pea-blossom. In the Spartium Scoparium, or common broom, I have lately observed a curious circumstance, the males or stamens are in two sets, one set rising a quarter of an inch above the other; the upper set does not arrive at their maturity so soon as the lower, and the stigma, or head of the female, is produced amongst the upper or immature set; but as soon as the pistil grows tall enough to burst open the keel-leaf, or hood of the flower, it bends itself round in an instant, like a French horn, and inserts its head, or stigma, amongst the lower or mature set of males. The pistil, or female, continues to grow in length; and in a few days the stigma arrives again amongst the upper set, by the time they become mature. This wonderful contrivance is readily seen by opening the keel-leaf of the flowers of broom before they burst spontaneously. See note on Collinsonia, Gloriosa, Draba.</P></NOTE></L>

In each flower there are four males and one female; two of the males stand higher than the other two; whence the name of the class "two powers." I have observed in the Ballota, and others of this class, that the two lower stamens, or makes become mature before the two higher. After they have shed their dust, they turn themselves away outwards; and the pistil, or female, continuing to grow a little taller, is applied to the upper stamens. See Glorista, and Genista.</P>
<P>All the plants of this class, which have naked seeds, are aromatic. The Marum, and Nepeta are particularly delightful to cats; no other brute animals seem pleased with any odours but those of their food or prey.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>MEADIA's soft chains <HI>five</HI> suppliant beaux confess,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Meadia.</HI> l. 61. Dodecatheon, American Cowslip. Five males and one female. The males, or anthers, touch each other. The uncommon beauty of this flower occasioned Linneus to give it a name signifying the twelve heathen gods; and Dr. Mead to affix his own name to it. The pistil is much longer than the stamens, hence the flower-stalks have their elegant bend, that the stigma may hang downwards to receive the fecundating dust of the anthers. And the petals are so beautifully turned back to prevent the rain or dew drops from sliding down and washing off this dust prematurely; and at the same time exposing it to the light and air. As soon as the seeds are sormed, it erects all the flower- stalks to prevent them from salling out; and thus loses the beauty of its figure. Is this a mechanical effect, or does it indicate a vegetable storgé to preserve its offspring? See note on Ilex, and Gloriosa.</P>
<P>In the Meadia, the Borago, Cyclamen, Solanum, and many others, the filaments are very short compared with the style. Hence it became necessary, 1st, to furnish the stamens with long anthers. 2d. I'o lengthen and bend the peduncle or flower-stalk, that the flower might hang downwards. 3d. To reflect the petals. 4th. To erect these pe∣duncles when the germ was fecundated. We may reason upon this by observing, that all this apparatus might have been spared, if the filaments alone had grown longer; and that thence in these flowers that the filaments are the most unchangeable parts; and that thence their comparative length, in respect to the style, would afford a most permanent mark of their generic character.</P></NOTE></L>

One male and one female inhabit this flower; but there are besides four imperfect males, or filaments without anthers upon them, called by Lin∣neus eunuchs. The flax of our country has ten filaments, and but five of them are ter∣minated with anthers; the Portugal flax has ten perfect males, or females; the Verbena of our country has four males; that of Sweden has but two; the genus Albuca, the Bignonia Catalpa, Gratiola, and hemlock-leaved Geranium have only half their filaments crowned with anthers. In like manner the florets, which form the rays of the flowers of the order frustraneous polygamy of the class syngenesia, or confederate males, as the sun∣flower, are furnished with a style only, and no stigma: and are thence barren. There is also a style without a stigma in the whole order dioecia gynandria; the male flowers of which are thence barren. The Opulus is another plant, which contains some unpro∣lific flowers. In like manner some tribes of insects have males, females, and neuters among them: as bees, wasps, ants.</P>
<P>There is a curious circumstance belonging to the class of insects which have two wings, or diptera, analogous to the rudiments of stamens above described; viz. two little knobs are found placed each on a stalk or peduncle, generally under a little arched scale; which appear to be rudiments of hinder wings; and are called by Linneus, halteres, or poisers, a term of his introduction. A. T. Bladh. Amaen. Acad. V. 7. Other animals have marks of having in a long process of time undergone changes in some parts of their bodies, which may have been effected to accommodate them to new ways of procuring their food. The existence of teats on the breasts of male animals, and which are gene∣rally rep'ete with a thin kind of milk at their nativity, is a wonderful instance of this kind. Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection? an idea countenanced by the modern discoveries and deductions concerning the progres∣sive formation of the solid parts of the terraqueous globe, and consonant to the dignity of the Creator of all things.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="65"/></L>

The double flowers, so much ad∣mired by the florists, are termed by the botanist vegetable monsters; in some of these the petals are multiplied three or four times, but without excluding the stamens, hence they produce some seeds, as Campanula and Stramoneum; but in others the petals become so numerous as totally to exclude the stamens, or males; as Caltha, Peonia, and Alcea; these produce no seeds, and are termed eunuchs. Philos. Botan. No. 150.</P>
<P>These vegetable monsters are formed in many ways. 1st. By the multiplication of the petals and the exclusion of the nectaries, as in larkspur. 2d. By the multiplication of the nectaries and exclusion of the petals; as in columbine. 3d. In some flowers grow∣ing in cymes, the wheel-shape flowers in the margin are multiplied to the exclusion of the bell-shape flowers in the centre; as in gelder-rose. 4th. By the elongation of the florets in the centre. Instances of both these are found in daily feverfew; for other kinds of vegetable monsters, see Plantago.</P>
<P>The per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anth is not changed in double flowers, hence the genus or family may be often disovered by the calyx, as in Hepatica, Ranunculus, Alcea.

The males of some of these plants, which are in separate flowers from the females, have an elastic membrane; which disperses their dust to a considerable dis∣tance, when the anthers burst open. This dust, on a fine day, may often be seen like a cloud hanging round the common nettle. The males and females of all the cone∣bearing plants are in separate flowers, either on the same or on different plants; they produce resins, and many of them are supposed to supply the most durable timber: what is called Venice-turpentine is obtained from the larch by wounding the bark about two feet from the ground, and catching it as it exsudes; Sanda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach is procured from com∣mon juniper; and lncense from a juniper with yellow fruit. The unperishable chests, which contain the Egyptian mummies, were of Cypress; and the Cedar, with which black lead pencils are covered, is not liable to be eaten by worms. See Miln's Bot. Dict. art. coniferae. The gates of St. Peter's church at Rome, which had lasted from the time of Constantine to that of Pope Eugene the fourth, that is to say eleven hun∣dred years, were of Cypress, and had in that time suffered no decay. According to Thucydides, the Athenians buried the bodies of their heroes in coffins of Cypress, as being not subject to decay. A similar durability has also been ascribed to Cedar. Thus Horace,

The flowers of this grass give the fragrant scent to hay. I am informed it is frequently viviparous, that is, that it bears sometimes roots or bulbs inst ad of seeds, which after a time drop off and strike root into the ground. This circumstance is said to obtain in many of the alpine grasses, whose seeds are perpetually devoured by small birds. The Festuca Dumetorum, sescue grass of the bushes, produces bulbs from the sheaths of its straw. The Allium Magicum, or magical onion, produces onions on its head, instead of seeds. The Polygonum Viviparum, viviparous bistort, rises about a foot high, with a beautiful spike of flowers, which are succeeded by buds or bulbs, which fall off and take root. There is a bush frequently seen on birch-trees, like a bird's nest, which seems to be a similar attempt of nature, to produce another tree; which falling off might take root in spongy ground.</P>

He adds, that if one filament be touched after it is separated from the floret, that it will contract like the muscular fibres of animal bodies, his experiments were tried on the Centauréa Calcitiapoides, and on artichokes, and globe-thistles.

The petals of this beautiful flower with three of the stamens, which are first mature, stand up in apparent disorder; and the pistil bends at nearly a right angle to insert its stigma amongst them. In a few days, as these decline, the other three stamens bend over, and approach the pistil. In the Fritillaria Persica, the six stamens are of equal lengths, and the anthers lie at a distance from the pistil, and three alternate ones approach first; and, when these decline, the other three approach; in the Lithrum Salicaria, (which has twelve males and one female) a beautiful red flower, which grows on the banks of rivers, six of the males arrive at ma∣turity, and surround the female some time before the other six; when these decline, the other six rise up, and supply their places. Several other flowers have in similar manner two sets of stamens of different ages, as Adoxa, Lychnis, Saxifraga. See Genista. Per∣haps a difference in the time of their maturity obtains in all these flowers, which have numerous stamens. In the Kalmia the ten stamens lie round the pistil like the radii of a wheel; and each anther is concealed in a nich of the corol to protect it from cold and moisture; these anthers rise separately from their niches, and approach the pistil for a time, and then recede to their former situations.</P></NOTE></L>

Three females and ten males inhabit each flower; the viscous material, which surrounds the stalks under the flowers of this plant, and of the Cucubulus Otites, is a curious contrivance to prevent various insects from plundering the honey, or devouring the seed. In the Dionaea Muscipula there is a still more won∣derful contrivance to prevent the depredations of insects: The leaves are armed with long teeth, like the antennae of insects, and lie spread upon the ground round the stem; and are so irritable, that when an insect creeps upon them, they fold up, and crush or pierce it to death. The last professor Linneus, in his Supplementum Plantarum, gives the fol∣lowing account of the Arum Muscivorum. The flower has the smell of carrion; by which the flies are invited to lay their eggs in the chamber of the flower, but in vain en∣deavour to escape, being prevented by the hairs pointing inwards; and thus perish in the flower, whence its name of fly-eater. P. 411. in the Dypsacus is another contrivance for this purpose, a bason of water is placed round each joint of the stem. In the Drosera is another kind of fly-trap. See Dypsacus and Drosera; the flowers of Siléne and Cucú∣balus are closed all day, but are open and give an agreeable odour in the night. See Cerea.

<L>Fair AMARYLLIS flies the incumbent storm,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Amaryllis.</HI> l. 152. Formosissima. Most beautiful Amaryllis. Six males, one female. Some of the bell-flowers close their apertures at night, or in rainy or cold weather, as the convolvulus, and thus protect their included stamens and pistils. Other bell-flowers hang their apertures downwards, as many of the lilies; in those the pistil, when at maturity, is longer than the stamens; and by this pendant attitude of the bell, when the anthers burst, their dust falls on the stigma; and these are at the same time sheltered as with an umbrella from rain and dews. But, as a free exposure to the air is necessary for their fecundation, the style and filaments in many of these flowers continue to grow longer after the bell is open, and hang down below its rim. In others, as in the mar∣tagon, the bell is deeply divided, and the divisions are reflected upwards, that they may not prevent the access of air, and at the same time afford some shelter from perpendicular rain or dew. Other bell-flowers, as the hemerocallis and amaryllis, have their bells nodding only, as it were, or hanging obliquely toward the horizon; which, as their stems are slender, turn like a weathercock from the wind; and thus very effectually preserve their inclosed stamens and anthers from the rain and cold. Many of these flowers, both before and after their season of fecundation, erect their heads perpen∣dicular to the horizon, like the Meadia, which cannot be explained from meer mechanism.</P>
<P>The Amaryllis formosissima is a flower of the last mentioned kind, and affords an agreeable example of <HI>art</HI> in the vegetable economy. 1. The pistil is of great length compared with the stamens; and this I suppose to have been the most unchangeable part of the flower, as in Meadia, which see. 2. To counteract this circumstance, the pistil and stamens are made to decline downwards, that the prolific dust might fall from the anthers on the stigma. 3. To produce this effect, and to secure it when produced, the corol is lacerated, contrary to what occurs in other flowers of this genus, and the lowest division with the two next lowest ones are wrapped closely over the style and filaments, binding them forceibly down lower toward the horizon than the usual inclination of the bell in this genus, and thus constitutes a most elegant flower. There is another con∣trivance for this purpose in the Hemeroca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lis flava; the long pistil often is bent some∣what like the capital letter <HI>N,</HI> with design to shorten it, and thus to bring the stigma amongst the anthers.</P></NOTE></L>

Many plants, like many animals, are furnished with arms for their protection; these are either aculei, prickles, as in rose and barberry, which are formed from the outer bark of the plant; or spinae, thorns, as in hawthorn, which are an elongation of the wood, and hence more difficult to be torn off than the former; or stimuli, stings, as in the nettles, which are armed with a venom∣ous fluid for the annoyance of naked animals. The shrubs and trees, which have prickles or thorns, are grateful food to many animals, as goosberry, and gorse; and would be quickly devoured, if not thus armed; the stings seem a protection against some kinds of insects, as well as the naked mouths of quadrupeds. Many plants lose their thorns by cultivation, as wild animals lose their ferocity; and some of them their horns. A curi∣ous circumstance attends the large hollies in Needwood-forest, they are armed with thorny leaves about eight feet high, and have smooth leaves above; as if they were con∣scious that horses and cattle could not reach their upper branches. See note on Meadia, and on Mancinella. The numerous clumps of hollies in Needwood-forest serve as land∣marks to direct the travellers across it in various directions; and as a shelter to the deer and cattle in winter; and in scarce seasons supply them with much food. For when the upper branches, which are without prickles, are cut down, the deer crop the leaves and peel off the bark. The bird-lime made from the bark of hollies seems to be a very similar material to the elastic gum, or Indian rubber, as it is called. There is a fossile elastic bitumen found at Matlock in Derbyshire, which much resembles these substances in its elasticity and inflammability. The thorns of the mimosa cornigere resemble cow's horns in appearance as well as in use. System of Vegetables, p. 782.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Fair LONICERA prints the dewy lawn,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Lonicera.</HI> l. 243. Caprifolium. Honeysuckle. Five males, one female. Nature has in many flowers used a wonderful apparatus to guard the nectary, or honey-gland, from infects. In the honey-suckle the petal terminates in a long tube like a cornucopiae, or horn of plenty; and the honey is produced at the bottom of it. In Aconitum, monks∣hood, the nectaries stand upright like two horns covered with a hood, which abounds with such acrid matter that no infects penetrate it. In Helleborus, hellebore, the many nectaries are placed in a circle, like little pitchers, and add much to the beauty of the flower. In the Columbine, Aquilegia, the nectary is imagined to be like the neck and body of a bird, and the two petals standing upon each side to represent wings; whence its name of columbine, as if resembling a nest of young pigeons fluttering whilst their parent feeds them. The importance of the nectary in the economy of vegetation is ex∣plained at large in the note on part the first.</P>
<P>Many infects are provided with a long and pliant proboscis for the purpose of acquiring this grateful food, as a variety of bees, moths, and butterflies: but the Sphinx Con∣volvuli, or unicorn moth, is furnished with the most remarkable proboscis in this climate. It carries it rolled up in concentric circles under its chin, and occasionally extends it to above three inches in length. This trunk consists of joints and muscles, and seems to have more versatile movements than the trunk of the elephant; and near its termination is split into two capillary tubes. The excellence of this contrivance for robbing the flowers of their honey, keeps this beautiful insect fat and bulky; though it flies only in the evening, when the flowers have closed their petals, and are thence more difficult of access; at the same time the brilliant colours of the moth contribute to its safety, by making it mistaken by the late sleeping birds for the flower it rests on.</P>
<P>Besides these there is a curious contrivance attending the Ophrys, commonly called the Bee-orchis, and the Fly-orchis, with some kinds of the Delphinium, called Bee∣larkspurs, to preserve their honey; in these the nectary and petals resemble in form and colour the insects, which plunder them: and thus it may be supposed, they often escape these hourly robbers, by having the appearance of being pre-occupied.

It seems necessary that the marriages of plants should be celebrated in the open air, either because the powder of the anther, or the mucilage on the stigma, or the reservoir of honey might receive injury from the water. Mr. Needham observed, that in the ripe dust of every flower, examined by the microscope some vesicles are perceived, from which a fluid had escaped; and that those, which st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> retain it, explode if they be wetted, like an eolopile suddenly exposed to a strong he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.

<P>This curious stem is sometimes pushed out of the ground in its horizontal situation by some of the inferior branches of the root, so as to give it some resemblance to a Lamb standing on four legs; and has been said to destroy all other plants in its vicinity. Sir Hans Sloane describes it under the name of Tartarian Lamb, and has given a print of it. Philos. Trans. abridged, v. 11. p. 646. but thinks some art had been used to give it an animal appearance. Dr. Hunter, in his edition of the Terra of Evelyn, has given a more curious print of it, much resembling a sheep. The down is used in India exter∣nally for stopping hemorrhages, and is called golden moss.</P>
<P>The thick downy clothing of some vegetables seems designed to protect them from the injuries of cold, like the wool of animals. Those bodies, which are bad conductors of electricity, are also bad conductors of heat, as glass, wax, air. Hence either of the two former of these may be melted by the flame of a blow-pipe very near the fingers which hold it without burning them; and the last, by being confined on the surface of animal bodies, in the interstices of their fur or wool, prevents the escape of their natural warmth; to which should be added, that the hairs themselves are imperfect conductors. The fat or oil of whales, and other northern animals, seems designed for the same pur∣pose of preventing the too sudden escape of the heat of the body in cold climates. Snow protects vegetables which are covered by it from cold, both because it is a bad conductor of heat itself, and contains much air in its pores. If a piece of camphor be immersed in a snow-ball, except one extremity of it, on setting fire to this, as the snow melts, the water becomes absorbed into the surrounding snow by capillary, attraction; on this c∣count, when living animals are buried in snow, they are not most ned by it; but the cavity enlarges as the snow dissolves, affording them both a dry and warm habitation.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Weak with nice sense, the chaste MIMOSA stands,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Mimosa.</HI> l. 321. The sensitive plant. Of the class Polygamy, one house. Naturalists have not explained the immediate cause of the collapsing of the sensitive plant; the leaves meet and close in the night during the sleep of the plant, or when exposed to much cold in the day-time, in the same manner as when they are affected by external violence, fold∣ing their upper surfaces together, and in part over each other like seales or tiles; so as to expose as little of the upper surface as may be to the air; but do not indeed collapse quite so far, since I have found, when touched in the night during their sleep, they fall still further; especially when touched on the foot-stalks between the stems and the leaflets, which seems to be their most sensitive or irritable part. Now as their situation after being exposed to external violence resembles their sleep, but with a greater degree of col∣lapse, may it not be owing to a numbness or paralysis consequent to too violent irri∣tation, like the saintings of animals from pain or fatigue? I kept a sensitive plant in a dark room till some hour after day-break; its leaves and leas-stalks were collapsed as in its most prosound sleep, and on exposing it to the light, above twenty minutes passed before the plant was thoroughly awake and had quite expanded itself. During the night the upper or smoother surfaces of the leaves are appressed together; this would seem to shew that the office of this surface of the leaf was to expose the fluids of the plant to the light as well as to the air. See note on Helianthus. Many flowers close up their petals during the night. See note on vegetable respiration in Part I.</P></NOTE></L>

There is a wonderful conformity between the vegetation of some plants, and the arrival of certain birds of passage. Linneus observes that the wood anemone blows in Sweden on the arrival of the swallow; and the marsh mary-gold, Caltha, when the cuckoo sings. Near the same coincidence was observed in England by Stillingfleet. The word Coccux in Greek signifies both a young fig and a cuckoo, which is supposed to have arisen from the coincidence of their appearance in Greece. Perhaps a similar coincidence of appearance in some parts of Asia gave occasion to the story of the loves of the rose and nightingale, so much celebrated by the eastern poets. See Dianthus. The times however of the appearance of vegetables in the spring seem occasionally to be influenced by their acquired habits, as well as by their sensibility to heat: for the roots of potatoes, onions, &amp;c. will germinate with much less heat in the spring than in the autumn; as is easily observable where these roots are stored for use; and hence malt is best made in the spring. 2d. The grains and roots brought from more southern latitudes germinate here sooner than those which are brought from more northern ones, owing to their acquired habits. Fordyce on Agriculture. 3d. It was observed by one of the scholars of Linneus, that the apple-trees sent from hence to New England blossomed for a few years too early for that climate, and bore no fruit; but afterwards learnt to accommodate themselves to their new situation. (Kalm's Travels.) 4th. The parts of animals become more sensible to heat after having been previously exposed to cold, as our hands glow on coming into the house after having held snow in them; this seems to happen to vegetables; for vines in grape-houses, which have been exposed to the winter's cold, will become forwarder and more vigorous than those which have been kept during the winter in the house. (Kenedy on Gardening.) This accounts for the very rapid vegetation in the northern latitudes after the solution of the snows.</P><P>The increase of the irritability of plants in respect to heat, after having been previ∣ously exposed to cold, is further illustrated by an experiment of Dr. Walker's. He cut apertures into a birch-tree at different heights; and on the 26th of March some of these apertures bled, or oozed with the sap-juice, when the thermometer was at 39; which same apertures did not bleed on the 13th of March, when the thermometer was at 44. The reason of this I apprehend was, because on the night of the 25th the thermometer was as low as 34; whereas on the night of the 12th it was at 41; though the ingenious author ascribes it to another cause.

If mixed with the food of young pigs or chickens, it colours their bones red. If they are fed alternate fortnights with a mixture of madder, and with their usual food alone, their bones will consist of concentric circles of white and red. Belchier, Phil. Trans. 1736. Animals fed with madder for the purpose of these experiments were found upon dissection to have thinner gall. Comment. de rebus. Lipsiae. This circumstance is worth further attention. The colouring materials of vege∣tables, like those which serve the purpose of tanning, varnishing, and the various medi∣cal purposes, do not seem essential to the life of the plant; but seem given it as a defence against the depredations of insects or other animals, to whom these materials are nauseous or deleterious. To insects and many smaller animals their colours contribute to conceal them from the larger ones which prey upon them. Caterpillars which feed on leaves are generally green; and earth-worms the colour of the earth which they inhabit; Butter∣flies, which frequent flowers, are coloured like them; small birds which frequent hedges have greenish backs like the leaves, and light coloured bellies like the sky, and are hence less visible to the hawk, who passes under them or over them. Those birds which are much amongst flowers, as the gold-finch (Fringilla carduelis), are furnished with vivid colours. The lark, partridge, hare, are the colour of the dry vegetables or earth on which they rest. And frogs vary their colour with the mud of the streams which they frequent; and those which live on trees are green. Fish, which are generally suspended in water, and swallows, which are generally suspended in air, have their backs the co∣lour of the distant ground, and their bellies of the sky. In the colder climates many of these become white during the existence of the snows. Hence there is apparent design in the colours of animals, whilst those of vegetables seem consequent to the other pro∣perties of the materials which possess them.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="375"/></L>

The words <HI>relaxation and bracing,</HI> which are generally thought expressive of the effects of warm and cold bathing, are mechanical terms, properly applied to drums or strings; but are only metaphors when applied to the effects of cold or warm bathing on animal bodies. The immediate cause of old age seems to reside in the inirritability of the finer vessels or parts of our system; hence these cease to act, and collapse or become horny or bony. The warm bath is peculiarly adapted to prevent these circumstances by its increasing our irritability, and by moisten∣ing and softening the skin, and the extremities of the finer vessels, which terminate in it. To those who are past the meridian of life, and have dry skins, and begin to be emaciated, the warm bath, for half an hour twice a week, I believe to be eminently ferviceable in retarding the advances of age.</P></NOTE></L>

They have their roots at the bottom of the Rhone, the flowers of the female plant float on the sur∣face of the water, and are furnished with an elastic spiral stalk, which extends or contracts as the water rises and falls; this rise or fall, from the rapid descent of the river, and the mountain torrents which flow into it, often amounts to many feet in a few hours. The flowers of the male plant are produced under water, and as soon as their farina, or dust, is mature; they detach themselves from the plant, and rise to the surface, continue to flourish, and are wafted by the air, or borne by the currents to the female flowers. In this resembling those tribes of insects, where the males at certain seasons acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, Cocchus, Lampyris, Phalaena, Brumata, Lichanella.

<L>Her buoyant skiff intrepid ULVA guides,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Ulva.</HI> l. 407. Clandestine marriage. This kind of sea-weed is buoyed up by bladders of air, which are formed in the duplicatures of its leaves; and forms immense float∣ing fields of vegetation; the young ones, branching out from the larger ones, and borne on similar little air-vessels. It is also found in the warm baths of Patavia; where the leaves are formed into curious cells or labyrinths for the purpose of floating on the water. See ulva labyrinthi-formis Lin. Spec. Plant. The air contained in these cells was found by Dr. Priestley to be sometimes purer than common air, and sometimes less pure; the air-bladders of fish seem to be similar organs, and serve to render them buoyant in the water. In some of these, as in the Cod and Haddock, a red membrane, consisting of a great number of leaves or duplicatures, is sound within the air-bag, which probably secretes this air from the blood of the animal. (Monro. Physiol. of Fish. p. 28.) To determine whether this air, when first separated from the blood of the animal or plant, be dephlogisticated air, is worthy inquiry. The bladder-sena (Colutea), and bladder-nut (Staphylaea), have their seed-vessels distended with air; the Ketmia has the upper joint of the stem immediately under the receptacle of the flower much distended with air; these seem to be analogous to the air-vessel at the broad end of the egg, and may probably become less pure as the seed ripens: some, which I tried, had the purity of the surround∣ing atmosphere. The air at the broad end of the egg is probably an organ serving the purpose-of respiration to the young chick, some of whose vessels are spread upon it like a placenta, or permeate it. Many are of opinion that even the placenta of the human setus, and cotyledons of quadropeds, are respiratory organs rather than nutritious ones.</P>
<P>The air in the hollow stems of grasses, and of some umbelliserous plants, bears analogy to the air in the quills, and in some of the bones of birds; supplying the place of the pith, which shrivels up after it has performed its office of protruding the young stem or feather. Some of these cavities of the bones are said to communicate with the lungs in birds. Phil. Trans.</P>
<P>The air-bladders of fish are nicely adapted to their intended purpose; for though they render them buoyant near the surface without the labour of using their fins, yet, when they rest at greater depths, they are no inconvenience, as the increased pressure of the water condenses the air which they contain into less space. Thus, if a cork or bladder of air was immersed a very great depth in the ocean, it would be so much compressed, as to become specially as heavy as the water, and would remain there. It is probable the unfortunate Mr. Day, who was drowned in a diving-ship of his own construction, milcarried from not attending to this circumstance; it is probable the quantity of air he took down with him, if he descended much lower than he expected, was condensed into so small a space as not to render the ship buoyant when he endeavoured to ascend.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>On DOVE'S green brink the fair TREMELLA stood,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Tremella. l. 427. Clandestine marriage. I have frequently observed fungusses of this Genus on old rails and on the ground to become a transparent jelly, after they had been frozen in autumnal mornings; which is a curious property, and distinguishes them from some other vegetable mucilage; for I have observed that the paste, made by boiling wheat-flour in water, ceases to be adhesive after having been frozen. I suspected that the Tremella Nostoc, or star-jelly, also had been thus produced; but have since been well informed, that the Tremella Nostoc is a mucilage voided by Herons after they have eaten frogs; hence it has the appearance of having been pressed through a hole; and limbs of frogs are said sometimes to be found amongst it; it is always seen upon plains or by the sides of water, places which Herons generally frequent.</P>
<P>Some of the Fungusses are so acrid, that a drop of their juice blisters the tongue; others intoxicate those who eat them. The Ostiacks in Siberia use them for the latter purpose; one Fungus of the species, Agaricus muscarum, eaten raw; or the decoction of three of them, produces intoxication for 12 or 16 hours. History of Russia. V. I. Nichols. 1780. As all acrid plants become less so, if exposed to a boiling heat, it is probable the common mushroom may sometimes disagree from being not sufficiently stewed. The Ostiacks blister their skin by a fungus found on Birch-trees; and use the Agaricus officin. for Soap. ib.</P>
<P>There was a dispute whether the fungusses should be classed in the animal or vegetable department. Their animal taste in cookery, and their animal smell when burnt, toge∣ther with their tendency to putrefaction, insomuch that the Phallus impudicus has gained the name of stink-horn; and lastly, their growing and continuing healthy without light, as the Licoperdon tuber or truffle, and the fungus vinosus or mucor in dark cellars, and the esculent mushrooms on beds covered thick with straw, would seem to shew that they approach towards the animals, or make a kind of isthmus connecting the two mighty kingdoms of animal and of vegetable nature.</P></NOTE></L>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is well to know what subjects are within the limits of your

But pray tell me, what is the essential difference be∣tween
Poetry and Prose? is it solely the melody or measure of the
language?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think not solely; for some prose has its melody, and even
measure. And good verses, well spoken in a language unknown to
the hearer, are not easily to be distinguished from good prose.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="430"/>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it the sublimity, beauty, or novelty of the sentiments?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so; for sublime sentiments are often better expressed in
prose. Thus when Warwick in one of the plays of Shakespear, is
left wounded on the field after the loss of the battle, and his friend
says to him, "Oh, could you but fly!" what can be more sublime
than his answer, "Why then, I would not fly." No measure of
verse, I imagine, could add dignity to this sentiment. And it would
be easy to select examples of the beautiful or new from prose writers,
which I suppose no measure of verse could improve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what then consists the essential difference between Poetry
and Prose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Next to the measure of the language, the principal distinction
appears to me to consist in this: that Poetry admits of but few words
expressive of very abstracted ideas, whereas Prose abounds with
them. And as our ideas derived from visible objects are more dis∣tinct
than those derived from the objects of our other sense, the
words expressive of these ideas belonging to vision make up the
principal part of poetic language. That is, the Poet writes princi∣pally
<PB N="50" REF="431"/>
to the eye, the Prose-writer uses more abstracted terms. Mr.
Pope has written a bad verse in the Windsor Forest:
<Q>And Kennet swift for silver Eels <HI>renown'd.</HI></Q>
The word renown'd does not present the idea of a visible object to
the mind, and is thence prosaic. But change this line thus,
<Q>And Kennet swift, where silver Graylings <HI>play.</HI></Q>
and it becomes poetry, because the scenery is then brought before
the eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may be done in prose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when it is done in a single word, it animates the prose; so
it is more agreeable to read in Mr. Gibbon's History, <Q>Germany
was at this time <HI>over-shadowed</HI> with extensive forests;</Q> than
Germany was at this time <HI>full</HI> of extensive forests. But where this
mode of expression occurs too frequently, the prose approaches to
poetry: and in graver works, where we expect to be instructed ra∣ther
than amused, it becomes tedious and impertinent. Some parts
of Mr. Burke's eloquent orations become intricate and enervated by
superfluity of poetic ornament; which quantity of ornament would
have been agreeable in a poem, where much ornament is ex∣pected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="432"/>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is then the office of Poetry only to amuse?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Muses are young ladies, we expect to see them dressed;
though not like some modern beauties with so much gauze and fea∣ther,
that "the Lady herself is the least part of her." There are
however didactic pieces of poetry, which are much admired, as the
Georgics of Virgil, Mason's English Garden, Hayley's Epistles;
nevertheless Science is best delivered in Prose, as its mode of reason∣ing
is from stricter analogies than metaphors or similies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not Personifications and Allegories distinguish poetry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are other arts of bringing objects before the eye; or of
expressing sentiments in the language of vision; and are indeed better
suited to the pen than the pencil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is strange, when you have just said they are used to bring
their objects before the eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>In poetry the personification or allegoric figure is generally
indistinct, and therefore does not strike us so forcibly as to make us
attend to its improbability; but in painting, the figures being all
<PB N="52" REF="433"/>
much more distinct, their improbability becomes apparent, and seizes
our attention to it. Thus the person of Concealment is very indis∣tinct,
and therefore does not compel us to attend to its improbability,
in the following beautiful lines of Shakespear:
<Q><L>—She never told her love;</L>
<L>But let Concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her damask cheek.—</L></Q>
But in these lines below the person of Reason obtrudes itself into our
company, and becomes disagreeable by its distinctness, and cones∣quent
improbability.</P>
<Q><L>To Reason I flew, and intreated her aid,</L>
<L>Who paused on my case, and each circumstance weigh'd;</L>
<L>Then gravely reply'd in return to my prayer,</L>
<L>That Hebe was fairest of all that were fair.</L>
<L>That's a truth, reply'd I, I've no need to be taught,</L>
<L>I came to you, Reason, to find out a fault.</L>
<L>If that's all, says Reason, return as you came,</L>
<L>To find fault with Hebe would forfeit my name.</L></Q>
<P>Allegoric figures are on this account in general less manageable
in painting and in statuary than in poetry: and can seldom be intro∣duced
in the two former arts in company with natural figures, as is
evident from the ridiculous effect of many of the paintings of Rubens
in the Luxemburgh gallery; and for this reason, because their im∣probability
becomes more striking, when there are the figures of
real persons by their side to compare them with.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="434"/>
Mrs. Angelica Kauffman, well apprised of this circumstance, has
introduced no mortal figures amongst her Cupids and her Graces. And
the great Roubiliac, in his unrivalled monument of Time and Fame
struggling for the trophy of General Fleming, has only hung up a
medallion of the head of the hero of the piece. There are however
some allegoric figures, which we have so often heard described or
seen delineated, that we almost forget that they do not exist in
common life; and hence view them without astonishment; as the
figures of the heathen mythology, of angels, devils, death and time;
and almost believe them to be realities, even when they are mixed
with representations of the natural forms of man. Whence I con∣clude,
that a certain degree of probability is necessary to prevent us
from revolting with distaste from unnatural images; unless we are
otherwise so much interested in the contemplation of them as not to
perceive their improbability.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this reasoning about degrees of probability just?—When Sir
Joshua Reynolds, who is unequalled both in the theory and practice
of his art, and who is a great master of the pen as well as the pencil,
has asserted in a discourse delivered to the Royal Academy, December
11, 1786, that <Q>the higher styles of painting, like the higher kinds
of the Drama, do not aim at any thing like deception; or have
any expectation, that the spectators should think the events there
represented are really passing before them.</Q> And he then accuses
Mr. Fielding of bad judgment, when he attempts to compliment
Mr. Garrick in one of his novels, by introducing an ignorant man,
mistaking the representation of a scene in Hamlet for a reality; and
<PB N="54" REF="435"/>
thinks, because he was an ignorant man, he was less liable to make
such a mistake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a metaphysical question, and requires more attention than
Sir Joshua has bestowed upon it.—You will allow, that we are per∣fectly
deceived in our dreams; and that even in our waking reveries,
we are often so much absorbed in the contemplation of what passes
in our imaginations, that for a while we do not attend to the lapse
of time or to our own locality; and thus suffer a similar kind of de∣ception
as in our dreams. That is, we believe things present before
our eyes, which are not so.</P>
<P>There are two circumstances, which contribute to this compleat
deception in our dreams. First, because in sleep the organs of sense
are closed or inert, and hence the trains of ideas associated in our
imaginations are never interrupted or disserered by the irritations of
external objects, and can not therefore be contrasted with our sen∣sations.
On this account, though we are affected with a variety of
passions in our dreams, as anger, love, joy; yet we never experience
surprize.—For surprize is only produced when any external irrita∣tions
suddenly obtrude themselves, and dissever our passing trains of
ideas.</P>
<P>Secondly, because in sleep there is a total suspension of our volun∣tary
power, both over the muscles of our bodies, and the ideas of our
minds; for we neither walk about, nor reason in compleat sleep.
Hence, as the trains of ideas are passing in our imaginations in dreams,
we cannot compare them with our previous knowledge of things, as
we do in our waking hours; for this is a voluntary exertion; and
thus we cannot perceive their incongruity.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="436"/>
Thus we are deprived in sleep of the only two means by which we
can distinguish the trains of ideas passing in our imaginations, from
those excited by our sensations; and are led by their vivacity to be∣lieve
them to belong to the latter. For the vivacity of these trains
of ideas, passing in the imagination, is greatly increased by the causes
above-mentioned; that is, by their not being disturbed or dissevered
either by the appulses of external bodies, as in surprize; or by our
voluntary exertions in comparing them with our previous knowledge
of things, as in reasoning upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now to apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>When by the art of the Painter or Poet a train of ideas is sug∣gested
to our imaginations, which interests us so much by the pain
or pleasure it affords, that we cease to attend to the irritations of
common external objects, and cease also to use any voluntary efforts
to compare these interesting trains of ideas with our previous know∣ledge
of things, a compleat reverie is produced: during which time,
however short, if it be but for a moment, the objects themselves
appear to exist before us. This, I think, has been called by an in∣genious
critic "the ideal presence" of such objects. (Elements of
Criticism by Lord Kaimes). And in respect to the compliment in∣tended
by Mr. Fielding to Mr. Garrick, it would seem that an ig∣norant
Rustic at the play of Hamlet, who has some previous belief
in the appearance of Ghosts, would sooner be liable to fall into re∣verie,
and continue in it longer, than one who possessed more know∣ledge
<PB N="56" REF="437"/>
of the real nature of things, and had a greater facility of ex∣ercising
his reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must require great art in the Painter or Poet to produce this
kind of deception?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The matter must be interesting from its sublimity, beauty, or
novelty; this is the scientific part; and the art consists in bringing
these distinctly before the eye, so as to produce (as above-mentioned)
the ideal presence of the object, in which the great Shakespear par∣ticularly
excells.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is not of any consequence whether the representations
correspond with nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not if they so much interest the reader or spectator as to in∣duce
the reverie above described. Nature may be seen in the market∣place,
or at the card-table; but we expect something more than this
in the play-house or picture-room. The further the artists recedes
from nature, the greater novelty he is likely to produce; if he rises
above nature, he produces the sublime; and beauty is probably a
selection and new combination of her most agreeable parts. Your∣self
will be sensible of the truth of this doctrine by recollecting over
<PB N="57" REF="438"/>
in your mind the works of three of our celebrated artists. Sir Joshua
Reynolds has introduced sublimity even into its protraits; we admire
the representation of persons, whose reality we should have passed
by unnoticed. Mrs. Angelica Kauffman attracts our eyes with
beauty, which I suppose no where exists; certainly few Grecian faces
are seen in this country. And the daring pencil of Fuseli transports
us beyond the boundaries of nature, and ravishes us with the charm
of the most interesting novelty. And Shakespear, who excells in all
these together, so far captivates the spectator, as to make him un∣mindful
of every kind of violation of Time, Place, or Existence.
As at the first appearance of the Ghost of Hamlet, <Q>his ear must
be dull as the fat weed, which roots itself on Lethe's brink,</Q> who
can attend to the improbality of the exhibition. So in many scenes
of the Tempest we perpetually believe the action passing before our
eyes, and relapse with somewhat of distaste into common life at the
intervals of the representation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose a poet of less ability would find such great machi∣nery
difficult and cumbersome to manage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so, we should be shocked at the apparent improbabilities.
As in the gardens of a Scicilian nobleman, described in Mr. Brydone's
and in Mr. Swinburn's travels, there are said to be fix hundred statues
of imaginary monsters, which so disgust the spectators, that the state
had once a serious design of destroying them; and yet the very
<PB N="58" REF="439"/>
improbable monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses have entertained
the world for many centuries.</P>

On the river Derwent near Matlock in Derbyshire, Sir RICHARD ARKWRIGHT has erected his curious and magnificent machinery for spinning cotton; which had been in vain attempted by many ingenious artists before him. The cotton-wool is first picked from the pods and seeds by women. It is then c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rded by <HI>cylindrical cards</HI> which move against each other, with different ve∣locities. It is taken from these by an iron-hand or comb, which has a motion similar to that of scratching, and takes the wool off the cards longitudinally in respect to the fibres or staple, producing a continued line loosely cohering, called the <HI>Rove</HI> or <HI>Roving.</HI> This Rove, yet very loosely twisted, is then received or drawn into a <HI>whirling canister,</HI> and is rolled by the centrifugal force in spiral lines within it; being yet too tender for the spindle. It is then passed between <HI>two pairs of rollers;</HI> the second pair moving faster than the first elongate the thread with greater equality than can be done by the hand; and is then twisted on spoles or bobbins.</P>
<P>The great fertility of the Cotton-plant in these fine flexile threads, whilst these from Flax, Hemp, and Nettles, or from the bark of the Mulberry-tree, require a previous pu∣trefection of the parenchymatous substance, and much mechanical labour, and afterwards bleaching, renders this plant of great importance to the world. And since Sir Richard Arkwright's ingenious machine has not only greatly abbreviated and simplesied the labour and art of carding and spinning the Cotton-wool, but performs both these cir∣cumstances <HI>better</HI> than can be done by hand, it is probable, that the clothing of this snall seed will become the principal clothing of mankind; though animal wool and silk may be preferable in colder climates, as they are more imperfect conductors of heat, and are thence a warmer clothing.</P></NOTE></L>

She began this work at the age of 74, when her sight would no longer serve her to paint, in which she much excelled; between her age of 74 and 82, at which time her eyes quite failed her, she executed the curious Hortus siccus above-mentioned, which 1 suppose contains a greater number of plants than were ever before drawn from the life by any one person. Her method consisted in placing the leaves of each plant with the petals, and all the other parts of the flowers, on coloured paper, and cutting them with scissars accurately to the natural size and form, and then pasting them on a dark ground; the effect of which is wonderful, and their accuracy less liable to sallacy than drawings. She is at this time (1788) in her 89th year, with all the powers of a fine under∣standing still unimpaired. I am informed another very ingenious lady, Mrs. North, is constructing a similar Hortus siccus, or Paper-garden; which she executes on a ground of vellum with such elegant taste and scientific accuracy, that it cannot fail to become a work of inestimable value.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="155"/></L>

And many other flowers close and open their petals at certain hours of the day; and thus constitute what Linneus calls the Horologe, or Watch of Flora. He enumerates 46 flowers, which possess this kind of sensibility. I shall mention a few of them with their respective hours of rising and setting, as Linneus terms them. He divides them first into <HI>meteoric</HI> flowers, which less accurate∣ly observe the hour of unfolding, but are expanded sooner or later, according to the cloudiness, moisture, or pressure of the atmosphere. 2d. <HI>Tropical</HI> flowers open in the morning and close before evening every day; but the hour of the expanding becomes earlier or later, as the length of the day increases or decreases. 3dly. <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> flow∣ers, which open at a certain and exact hour of the day, and for the most part close at another determinate hour.</P>
<P>Hence the Horologe or Watch of Flora is formed from numerous plants, of which the following are those most common in this country. Leontodon taraxacum, Dandelion, opens at 5—6, closes at 8—9. Hieracium pilosella, mouse-ear hawkweed, opens at 8, closes at 2. Sonchus laevis, smooth Sow-thistle, at 5 and at 11—12. Lactuca sativa, cultivated Lettice, at 7 and 10. Tragopogon luteum, yellow Goatsbeard, at 3—5 and at 9—10. Lapsana, nipplewort, at 5—6 and at 10—1. Nymphaea alba, white water lily, at 7 and 5. Papaver nudicaule, naked poppy, at 5 and at 7. Hemerocallis fulva, tawny Day-lily, at 5 and at 7—8. Convolvulus, at 5—6. Malva, Mallow, at 9—10, and at 1. Arenarea purpurea, purple Sandwort, at 9—10, and at 2—3. Anagallis, pimpernel, at 7—8. Portulaca hortensis, garden Purslain, at 9—10, and at 11—12. Dianthus prolifer, proliferous Pink, at 8 and at 1. Cichoreum. Succory, at 4—5. Hypochaeris, at 6—7, and at 4—5.

This curious metamorph se of the corol, when the nectaries fall off, seems to shew that the white juices of the corol were before carried to the nectaries, for the purpose of producing honey: because when these nectaries fall off, no more of the white juice is secreted in the corol, but it becomes green, and degenerates into a calyx.

The most beautiful flowers of the Cactus grandiflorus (see Cerea) are of equally short dura∣tion, but have their existence in the night. And the flowers of the Hibiscus trionum are said to continue but a single hour. The courtship between the males and females in these flowers might be easily watched; the males are said to approach and recede from the females alternately.

The effect of this plant in that kind of Dropsy, which is termed anasarca, where the legs and thighs are much swelled, attended with great difficulty of breathing, is truly astonishing. In the ascites accompanied with anasarca of people past the meridian of life it will also sometimes succeed. The method of administering it requires some cau∣tion, as it is liable, in greater doses, to induce very violent and debilitating sickness, which continues one or two days, during which time the dropsical collection however disappears. One large spoonful, or half an ounce, of the following decoction, given twice a day, will generally succeed in a few days. But in more robust people, one large spoonful every two hours, till four spoonfuls are taken, or till sickness occurs, will eva∣cuate the dropsical swellings with greater certainty, but is liable to operate more vio∣lently. Boil four ounces of the fresh leaves of purple Foxglove (which leaves may be had at all seasons of the year) from two pints of water to twelve ounces; add to the strained liquor, while yet warm, three ounces of rectified spirit of wine. A theory of the effects of this medicine, with many successful cases, may be seen in a pamphlet, called, " Experiments on Mucilaginous and Purulent Matter," published by Dr. Dar∣win in 1780.

<SPEAKER>Bookseller.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE monsters of your Botanic Garden are as sur∣prising
as the bulls with brazen feet, and the fire-breathing
dragons, which guarded the Hesperian fruit; yet are they
not disgusting, nor mischievous: and in the manner you have
chained them together in your exhibition, they succeed each other
amusingly enough, like prints of the London Cries, wrapped upon
rollers, with a glass before them. In this at least they resemble the
monsters in Ovid's Metamorphoses; but your similies, I suppose,
are Homeric?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great Bard well understood how to make use of this
kind of ornament in Epic Poetry. He brings his valiant heroes
into the field with much parade, and sets them a fighting with great
fury; and then, after a few thrusts and parries, he introduces a long
string of similies. During this the battle is supposed to continue;
and thus the time necessary for the action is gained in our imagina∣tions;
<PB N="93" REF="474"/>
and a degree of probability produced, which contributes to
the temporary deception or reverie of the reader.</P>
<P>But the similies of Homer have another agreeable characteristic;
they do not quadrate, or go upon all fours (as it is called), like the
more formal similies of some modern writers; any one resembling
feature seems to be with him a sufficient excuse for the introduction
of this kind of digression; he then proceeds to deliver some agree∣able
poetry on this new subject, and thus converts every simile into
a kind of short episode.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then a simile should not very accurately resemble the subject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; it would then become a philosophical analogy, it would
be ratiocination instead of poetry: it need only so far resemble the
subject, as poetry itself ought to resemble nature. It should have
so much sublimity, beauty, or novelty, as to interest the reader;
and should be expressed in picturesque language, so as to bring the
scenery before his eye; and should lastly bear so much veri-simili∣tude
as not to awaken him by the violence of improbability or in∣congruity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>May not the reverie of the reader be dissipated or disturbed
by disagreeable images being presented to his imagination, as well
as by improbable or incongruous ones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="94" REF="475"/>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; he will endeavour to rouse himself from a disagree∣able
reverie, as from the night-mare. And from this may be dis∣covered
the line of boundary between the Tragic and the Horrid:
which line, however, will veer a little this way or that, according to
the prevailing manners of the age or country, and the peculiar asso∣ciations
of ideas, or idiosyncracy of mind, of individuals. For in∣stance,
if an artist should represent the death of an officer in battle,
by shewing a little blood on the bosom of his shirt, as if a bullet
had there penetrated, the dying figure would affect the beholder
with pity; and if fortitude was at the same time expressed in his
countenance, admiration would be added to our pity. On the con∣trary,
if the artist should chuse to represent his thigh as shot away
by a cannon ball, and should exhibit the bleeding flesh and shattered
bone of the stump, the picture would introduce into our minds ideas
from a butcher's shop, or a surgeon's operation-room, and we should
turn from it with disgust. So if characters were brought upon the
stage with their limbs disjointed by torturing instruments, and the
floor covered with clotted blood and scattered brains, our theatric
reverie would be destroyed by disgust, and we should leave the play∣house
with detestation.</P>
<P>The Painters have been more guilty in this respect than the
Poets; the cruelty of Apollo in flaying Marcias alive is a favourite
subject with the antient artists: and the tortures of expiring mar∣tyrs
have disgraced the modern ones. It requires little genius to
exhibit the muscles in convulsive action either by the pencil or
the chiffel, because the interstices are deep, and the lines strongly
defined: but those tender gradations of muscular action, which
constitute the graceful attitudes of the body, are difficult to con∣ceive
or to execute, except by a master of nice discernment and
cultivated taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="95" REF="476"/>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what definition would you distinguish the Horrid from
the Tragic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose the latter consists of Distress attended with Pity,
which is said to be allied to Love, the most agreeable of all our pas∣sions;
and the former in Distress, accompanied with Disgust, which
is allied to Hate, and is one of our most disagreeable sensations.
Hence, when horrid scenes of cruelty are represented in pictures, we
wish to disbelieve their existence, and voluntarily exert ourselves to
escape from the deception: whereas the bitter cup of true Tragedy
is mingled with some sweet consolatory drops, which endear our
tears, and we continue to contemplate the interesting delusion with
a delight which it is not easy to explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has not this been explained by Lucretius, where he describes
a shipwreck; and says, the Spectators receive pleasure from feeling
themselves safe on land? and by Akenside, in his beautiful poem on
the Pleasures of Imagination, who ascribes it to our finding objects
for the due exertion of our passions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must not confound our sensations at the contemplation of
real misery with those which we experience at the scenical repre∣sentations
of tragedy. The spectators of a shipwreck may be at∣tracted
by the dignity and novelty of the object; and from these
may be said to receive pleasure; but not from the distress of the suf∣ferers.
An ingenious writer, who has criticised this dialogue in the
English Review for August, 1789, adds, that one great source of our
pleasure from scenical distress arises from our, at the same time,
generally contemplating one of the noblest objects of nature, that
<PB N="96" REF="477"/>
of Virtue triumphant over every difficulty and oppression, or support∣ing
its votary under every suffering: or, where this does not occur,
that our minds are relieved by the justice of some signal punishment
awaiting the delinquent. But, besides this, at the exhibition of a good
tragedy, we are not only amused by the dignity, and novelty, and
beauty, of the objects before us; but, if any distressful circumstances
occur too forcible for our sensibility, we can voluntarily exert our∣selves,
and recollect, that the scenery is not real: and thus not only
the pain, which we had received from the apparent distress, is
lessened, but a new source of pleasure is opened to us, similar to that
which we frequently have felt on awaking from a distressful
dream; we are glad that it is not true. We are at the same time
unwilling to relinquish the pleasure which we receive from the other
interesting circumstances of the drama; and on that account quickly
permit ourselves to relapse into the delusion; and thus alternately
believe and disbelieve, almost every moment, the existence of the
objects represented before us.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The descriptions of the mangled carcasses of the companions
of Ulysses, in the cave of Polypheme, is in this respect certainly ob∣jectionable,
as is well observed by Scaliger. And in the play of Titus
Andronicus, if that was written by Shakespear (which from its in∣ternal
evidence I think very improbable), there are many horrid and
disgustful circumstances. The following Canto is submitted to the
candour of the critical reader, to whose opinion I shall submit in

It grows amid the mouldering bones and decayed coffins in the ruinous vaults of Sleaford-church in Lincolnshire. The superstitious ceremonies or hisories belonging to some vegetables have been truly ridiculous; thus the Druids are said to have cropped the Misletoe with a golden axe or sickle; and the Bryony, or Mandrake, was said to utter a scream when its root was drawn from the ground; and that the ani∣mal which drew it up became diseased and soon died: on which account, when it was wanted for the purposes of medicine, it was usual to loosen and remove the earth about the root, and then to tie it by means of a cord to a dog's tail, who was whipped to pull it up, and was then supposed to suffer for the impiety of the action. And even at this day bits of dried root of Peony are rubbed smooth, and strung, and sold under the name of Anodyne necklaces, and tied round the necks of children, to facilitate the growth of their teeth! add to this, that in Price's History of Cornwall, a book published about ten years ago, the Virga Divinatoria, or Divining Rod, has a degree of credit given to it. This rod is of hazle, or other light wood, and held horizontally in the hand, and is said to bow towards the ore whenver the Conjurer walks over a mine. A very few years ago, in France, and even in England, another kind of divining rod has been used to dis∣cover springs of water in a similar manner, and gained some credit. And in the very last year, there were many in France, and some in England, who underwent an enchant∣ment without any divining rod at all, and believed themselves to be affected by an invi∣sible agent, which the Enchanter called Animal Magnetism!</P></NOTE></L>

<L>The WILL presides not in the bower of SLEEP.<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The Will presides not.</HI> l. 74. Sleep consists in the abolition of all voluntary power, both over our muscular motions and our ideas; for we neither walk nor reason in sleep. But, at the same time, many of our muscular motions, and many of our ideas, continue to be excited into action in consequence of internal irritations and of internal sensa∣tions; for the heart and arteries continue to beat, and we experience variety of passions, and even hunger and thirst in our dreams. Hence I conclude, that our nerves of sense are not torpid or inert during sleep; but that they are only precluded from the perception of external objects, by their external organs being rendered unfit to transmit to them the appu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of external bodies, during the suspension of the power of volition; thus the eye-lids are closed in sleep, and I suppose the tympanum of the ear is not stretched, because they are deprived of the voluntary exertions of the muscles appropriated to these pur∣poses; and it is probable something similar happens to the external apparatus of our other organs of sense, which may render them unfit for their office of perception during sleep: for milk put into the mouths of sleeping babes occasions them to swallow and suck; and, if the eye-lid is a little opened in the day-light by the exertions of disturbed sleep, the person dreams of being much dazzled. See first Interlude.</P>
<P>When there arises in sleep a painful desire to exert the voluntary motions, it is called the Nightmare or Incubus. When the sleep becomes so imperfect that some muscular motions obey this exertion of desire, people have walked about, and even performed some domestic offices in sleep; one of these sleep-walkers I have frequently seen: once she smelt of a tube-rose, and sung, and drank a dish of tea in this state; her awaking was always attended with prodigious surprize, and even fear; this disease had daily periods, and seemed to be of the epileptic kind.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>The blood-smear'd mansion of gigantic THOR,—<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Gigantic Thor.</HI> 1. 90. Near the village of Wetton, a mile or two above Dove-Dale, near Ashburn in Derbyshire, there is a spacious cavern about the middle of the ascent of the mountain, which still retains the Name of Thor's house; below is an extensive and romantic common, where the rivers Hamps and Manifold sink into the earth, and rise again in Ilam gardens, the seat of John Port, Esq. about three mile below. Where these rivers rise again there are impressions resembling Fish, which appear to be of Jasper bedded in Limestone. Calcareous Spars, Shells converted into a kind of Agate, corallines in Marble, ores of Lead, Copper, and Zinc, and many strata of Flint, or Chert, and of Toadstone, or Lava, abound in thi part of the country.

<P>The odours of many flowers, so delightful to our sense of smell, as well as the dis∣greeable scents of others, are owing to the exhalation of their essential oils. These essential oils have greater or less volatility, and are all inflammable; many of them are poisons to us, as these of Laurel and Tobacco; others possess a narcotic quality, as is evinced by the oil of cloves instantly relieving slight tooth-achs; from oil of cinnamon relieving the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccup; and balsam of peru relieving the pain of some ulcers. They are all deleterious to certain insects, and hence their use in the vegetable economy being produced in flowers or leaves to protect them from the depredations of their voracious enemies. One of the essential oils, that of turpentine, is recommended, by M. de Thoffe, for the purpose of destroying insects which infect both vegetables and animals. Having observed that the trees were attacked by multitudes of small insects of different colours (pucins ou purrons), which injured their young branches, he destroyed them all intinaely in the following manner: he put into a bowl a few handfuls of earth, on which he poured a small quantity of oil of turpentine; he then beat the whole toge∣ther with a spatula, p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring on it water till it became of the consistence of soup; with this mixture he moistened the ends of the branches, and both the insects and their eggs were destroyed, and other insects kept aloof by the scent of the turpentine. He adds, that he destroyed the fleas of his puppies by once bathing them in warm water impreg∣nated with oil of turpentine. Mem. d'Agriculture, An. 1787, Trimest. Printemp. p. 109. I sprinkled some oil of turpentine, by means of a brush, on some branches of a nectarine-tree, which was covered with the aphis; but it killed both the insect and the branches: a solution of arsenic much diluted did the same. The shops of medicine are supplied with resins, balsams, and essential oils; and the tar and pitch, for mechanical purposes, are produced from these vegetable secretions.</P></NOTE></L>

Variety of noxious plants abound in all countries; in our own the deadly night-shade, henbane, hounds-tongue, and many others, are seen in almost every high road un∣touched by animals. Some have asked, what is the use of such abundance of poisons? The nauseous or pungent juices of some vegetables, like the thorns of others, are given them for their defence from the depredations of animals; hence the thorny plants are in general wholesome and agreeable food to graminivorous animals. See note on Ilex. The flowers or petals of plants are perhaps in general more acrid than their leaves; hence they are much seldomer eaten by insects. This seems to have been the use of the essential oil in the vegetable economy, as observed above in the notes on Dictamnus and on Ilex. The fragrance of plants is thus a part of their defence. These pungent or nauseous juices of vegetables have supplied the science of medicine with its principal materials, such as purge, vomit, intoxicate, &amp;c.</P></NOTE></L>

The vege∣table poisons, like the animal ones, produce more sudden and dangerous effects, when instilled into a wound, than when taken into the stomach; whence the families of Marsi and Psilli, in antient Rome, sucked the poison without injury out of wounds made by vipers, and were supposed to be indued with supernatural powers for this purpose. By the experiments related by Beccaria, it appears that four or five times the quantity, taken by the mouth, had about equal effects with that infused into a wound.

The exhalations from ripe fruit, or withering leaves, are proved much to injure the air in which they are consined; and, it is probable, all those vegetables which emit a strong scent may do this in a greater or less degree, from the Rose to the Lobelia; whence the unwholesomeness in living per∣petually in such an atmosphere of perfume as some people wear about their hair, or carry in their handkerchiefs.

But by the registers there kept, not one in four are said to return.

<L>With blushes bright as morn fair ORCHIS charms,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Orchis.</HI> l. 259. The Orchis morio in the circumstance of the parent-root shrivelling up and dying, as the young one increases, is not only analogous to other tuberous or knobby roots, but also to some bulbous roots, as the tulip. The manner of the pro∣duction of herbaceous plants from their various perennial roots, seems to want further investigation, as their analogy is not yet clearly established. The caudex, or true root, in the orchis lies above the knob; and from this part the fibrous roots and the new knob are produced. In the tulip the caudex lies below the bulb; from whence proceed the fibrous roots and the new bulbs; and I suspect the tulip-root, after it has flowered, dies like the orchis-root; for the stem of the last year's tulip lies on the outside, and not in the center of the new bulb; which I am informed does not happen in the three or four first years when raised from feed, when it only produces a stem, and slender leaves without flowering. In the tulip-root, dissected in the early spring, just before it begins to shoot, a perfect flower is seen in its center; and between the first and second coat the large next year's bulb is, I believe, produced; between the second and third coat, and between this and the fourth coat, and perhaps further, other less and less bulls are visible, all adjoining to the caudex at the bottom of the mother-bulb; and which, I am told, require as many years before they will flower, as the number of the coats with which they are covered. This annual reproduction of the tulip-root induces some florists to believe that tulip-roots never die naturally, as they lose so few of them; whereas the hyacinth-roots, I am informed, will not last above five or seven years after they have flowered.</P>
<P>The hyacinth-root differs from the tulip-root, as the stem of the last year's flower is always found in the center of the root, and the new off-sets arise from the caudex below the bulb, but not beneath any of the concentric coats of the root, except the external one: hence Mr. Eaton, an ingenious florist of Derby, to whom I am indebted for most of the observations in this note, concludes, that the hyacinth-root does not perish an∣nually after it has flowered like the tulip. Mr. Eaton gave me a tulip root which had been set too deep in the earth, and the caudex had elongated itself near an inch, and the new bulb was formed above the old one, and detached from it, instead of adher∣ing to its side.</P>
<P>The caudex of the ranunculus, cultivated by the florists, lies above the claw-like root; in this the old root or claws die annually, like the tulip and orchis, and the new claws, which are seen above the old ones, draw down the caudex lower into the earth. The same is said to happen to Scabiosa, or Devil's bit, and some other plants, as vale∣rian and greater plantain; the new fibrous roots rising round the caudex above the old ones, the inferior end of the root becomes stumped, as if cut off, after the old fibrous are decayed, and the caudex is drawn down into the earth by these new roots.

This parasite plant (the seed splitting without cotyledons), protruces a spiral body, and not endeavouring to root itself in the earth ascends the vegetables in its vicinity, spirally W. S. E. or contrary to the movement of the sun; and absorbs its nourishment by vessels apparently inserted into its supporters. It bears no leaves, except here and there a scale, very small, mem∣branous, and close under the branch. Lin. Spec. Plant. edit. a Reichard. Vol. I. p. 352. The Rev. T. Martyn, in his elegant letters on botany, adds, that, not content with support, where it lays hold, there it draws its nourishment; and at length, in gratitude for all this, strangles its entertainer. Let. xv. A contest for air and light obtains throughout the whole vegetable world; shrubs rise above herbs; and, by precluding the air and light from them, injure or destroy them; trees suffocate or incommode shrubs; the parasite climbing plants, as Ivy, Clematis, incommode the taller trees; and other parasites, which exist without having roots on the ground, as Misletoe, Tillan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sia, Epidendrum, and the mosses and sunguses, incommode them all.</P>
<P>Some of the plants with voluble stems ascend other plants spirally east-south-west, as Humulus, Hop, Lonicera, Honey-suckle, Tamus, black Bryony, Helxine. Others turn their spiral stems west-south-east, as convolvulus, Corn-bind, Phaseolus, Kidney∣bean, Basella, Cynanche, Euphorbia, Eupatorium. The proximate or final causes of this difference have not been investigated. Other plants are furnished with tendrils for the purpose of climbing: if the tendril meets with nothing to lay hold of in its first revolution, it makes another revolution; and so on till it wraps itself quite up like a cork-crew; hence, to a careless observer, it appears to move gradually backwards and forwards, being seen sometimes pointing eastward and sometimes westward. One of the Indian grasses, Panicum arborescens, whose stem is no thicker than a goose-quill, rises as high as the tallest trees in this contest for light and air. Spec. Plant a Reichard, Vol. I. p. 161. The tops of many climbing plants are tender from their quick growth; and, when deprived of their acrimony by boiling, are an agreeable article of food. The Hop tops are in common use. I have eaten the tops of white Bryony, Bryonia alba, and found them nearly as grateful as Asparagus, and think this plant might be profitably cultivated as an early garden-vegetable. The Tamus (called black Bryony), was less agreeable to the taste when boiled. See Galanthus.</P></NOTE></L>

Some philosophers have believed that the continent of America was not raised out of the great ocean at so early a period of time as the other continents. One reason for this opinion was, because the great lakes, perhaps nearly as large as the Mediterranean Sea, consist of fresh water. And as the sea-salt seems to have its origin from the destruction of vegetable and animal bodies, washed down by rains, and carried by rivers into lakes or seas; it would seem that this source of sea-salt had not so long existed in that country. There is, however, a more satisfactory way of explaining this circumstance; which is, that the American lakes lie above the level of the ocean, and are hence perpetually desalited by the rivers which run through them; which is not the case with the Mediterranean, into which a current from the main ocean perpetually passes.</P></NOTE></L>

This is one of the American fruits, which are annually thrown on the coasts of Norway; and are frequently in so recent a state as to vegetate, when properly taken care of, the fruit of the anacardium, cashew-nut; of cucurbita lagenaria, bottlegourd; of the mimosa seandens, cocoons; of the piscidia crythrina, logwood-tree; and cocoa-nuts are enumerated by Dr. Tonning. (Amaen. Acad. 149.) amongst these emigrant seeds. The fact is truly wonderful, and cannot be accounted for but by the existence of under currents in the depths of the ocean; or from vortexes of water passing from one country to another through caverns of the earth.</P>
<P>Sir Hans Sloane has given an account of four kinds of seeds, which are frequently thrown by the sea upon the coasts of the islands of the northern parts of Scotland. Phil. Trans. abridged, Vol. III. p. 540. which seeds are natives of the West Indies, and seem to be brought thither by the gulf-stream deserbed below. One of these is called, by Sir H. Sloane, Phaseolus maximus perennis, which is often also thrown on the coast of Kerry in Ireland; another is called, in Jamaica, Horse-eye-bean; and a third is called Niker in Jamaica. He adds, that the Lenticula marina, or Sargosso, grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is carried by the winds and current towards the coast of Florida, and thence into the North-American ocean, where it lies very thick on the surface of the sea.</P>
<P>Thus a rapid current passes from the gulf of Florida to the N. E. along the coast of North-America, known to seamen by the name of the GULF-STREAM. A chart of this was published by Dr. Francklin in 1768, from the information principally of Capt. Folger. This was confirmed by the ingenious experiments of Dr. Blagden, published in 1781, who found that the water of the Gulf-stream was from six to eleven degrees warmer than the water of the sea through which it ran; which must have been occa∣sioned by its being brought from a hotter climate. He ascribes the origin of this current to the power of the trade-winds, which, blowing always in the same direction, carry the waters of the Atlantic ocean to the westward, till they are stopped by the opposing con∣tinent on the west of the Gulf of Mexico, and are thus accumulated there, and run down the Gulf of Florida. Philos. Trans. V. 71, p. 335. Governor Pownal has given an elegant map of this Gulf-stream, tracing it from the Gulf of Florida north∣ward as sar as Cape Sable in Nova Scotia, and then across the Atlantic ocean to the coast of Africa between the Canary-islands and Senegal, increasing in breadth▪ as it runs, till it occupies five or six degrees of latitude. The Governer likewise ascribes this current to the force of the trade-winds <HI>protruding</HI> the waters westward, till they are opposed by the continent, and accumulated in the Gulf of Mexico. He very ingeni∣ously observes, that a great eddy must be produced in the Atlantic ocean between this Gulf-stream and the westerly current protruded by the tropical winds, and in this eddy are found the immense fields of floating vegetables, called Saragosa weeds, and Gulf∣weeds, and some light woods, which circulate in these vast eddies, or are occasionally driven out of them by the winds. Hydraulic and Nautical Observations by Governor Pownal, 1787. Other currents are mentioned by the Governor in this ingeniou work, as those in the Indian Sea, northward of the line, which are ascribed to the influence of the Monsoons. It is probable, that in process of time the narrow tract of land on the west of the Gulf of Mexico may be worn away by this elevation of water dashing against it, by which this immense current would cease to exist, and a wonderful change take place in the Gulf of Mexico and West Indian islands, by the subsiding of the sea, which might probably lay all those islands into one, or join them to the continent.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>POETRY has been called a sister-art both to Painting and to Music; I wish to know, what are the
particulars of their relationship?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Poet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been already observed, that the principal part of the
language of poetry consists of those words, which are expressive of
the ideas, which we originally receive by the organ of sight; and
in this it nearly indeed resembles painting; which can express itself
in no other way, but by exciting the ideas or sensations belonging
to the sense of vision. But besides this essential similitude in the
language of the poetic pen and pencil, these two sisters resemble
each other, if I may so say, in many of their habits and manners.
The painter, to produce a strong effect, makes a few parts of his
picture large, distinct, and luminous, and keeps the remainder in
shadow, or even beneath its natural size and colour, to give emi∣nence
to the principal figure. This is similar to the common
<PB N="134" REF="515"/>
manner of poetic composition, where the subordinate characters are
kept down, to elevate and give consequence to the hero or heroine
of the piece.</P>
<P>In the south aile of the cathedral church at Lichfield, there is an
antient monument of a recumbent figure; the head and neck of
which lie on a roll of matting in a kind of niche or cavern in the
wall; and about five feet distant horizontally in another opening or
cavern in the wall are seen the feet and ankles, with some folds of
garment, lying also on a matt; and though the intermediate space is
a solid stone-wall, yet the imagination supplies the deficiency, and
the whole figure seems to exist before our eyes. Does not this re∣semble
one of the arts both of the painter and the poet? The former
often shows a mulcular arm amidst a group of figures, or an im∣passioned
face; and, hiding the remainder of the body behind other
objects, leaves the imagination to compleat it. The latter, describing
a single feature or attitude in picturesque words, produces before the
mind an image of the whole.</P>
<P>I remember seeing a print, in which was represented a shrivelled
hand stretched through an iron grate, in the stone floor of a prison∣yard,
to reach at a mess of porrage, which affected me with more
horrid ideas of the distress of the prisoner in the dungeon below,
than could have been perhaps produced by an exhibition of the
whole person. And in the following beautiful scenery from the
Midsummer-night's dream, (in which I have taken the liberty to
alter the place of a comma), the description of the swimming step and
prominent belly bring the whole figure before our eyes with the
distinctness of reality.</P>
<Q><L>When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,</L>
<L>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</L>
<PB N="135" REF="516"/>
<L>Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,</L>
<L>Following her womb, (then rich with my young squire),</L>
<L>Would imitate, and sail upon the land.</L></Q>
<P>There is a third sister-feature, which belongs both to the pictorial
and poetic art; and that is the making sentiments and passions visible,
as it were, to the spectator; this is done in both arts by describing
or portraying the effects or changes which those sentiments or
passions produce upon the body. At the end of the unaltered play
of Lear, there is a beautiful example of poetic painting; the old
King is introduced as dying from grief for the loss of Cordelia;
at this crisis, Shakespear, conceiving the robe of the king to be held
together by a clasp, represents him as only saying to an attendant
courtier in a faint voice, "Pray, Sir, undo this button,—thank you,
Sir," and dies. Thus by the art of the poet, the oppression at the
bosom of the dying King is made visible, not described in words.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the features, in which these Sister-arts do not re∣semble
each other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ingenious Bishop Berkeley, in his Treatise on Vision, a
work of great ability, has evinced, that the colours, which we see,
are only a language suggesting to our minds the ideas of solidity and
extension, which we had before received by the sense of touch.
Thus when we view the trunk of a tree, our eye can only acquaint
us with the colours or shades; and from the previous experience of
the sense of touch, these suggest to us the cylindrical form, with the
prominent or depressed wrinkles on it. From hence it appears, that
<PB N="136" REF="517"/>
there is the strictest analogy between colours and sounds; as they
are both but languages, which do not represent their correspondent
ideas, but only suggest them to the mind from the habits or associ∣ations
of previous experience. It is therefore reasonable to conclude,
that the more artificial arrangements of these two languages by the
poet and the painter bear a similar analogy.</P>
<P>But in one circumstance the Pen and the Pencil differ widely from
each other, and that is the quantity of Time which they can in∣clude
in their respective representations. The former can unravel a
long series of events, which may constitute the history of days or
years; while the latter can exhibit only the actions of a moment.
The Poet is happier in describing successive scenes; the Painter in
representing stationary ones: both have their advantages.</P>
<P>Where the passions are introduced, as the Poet, on one hand, has
the power gradually to prepare the mind of his reader by previous
climacteric circumstances; the Painter, on the other hand, can throw
stronger illumination and distinctness on the principal moment or
catastrophe of the action; besides the advantage he has in using an
universal language, which can be <HI>read</HI> in an instant of time. Thus
where a great number of figures are all seen together, supporting or
contrasting each other, and contributing to explain or aggrandize
the principal effect, we view a picture with agreeable surprize, and
contemplate it with unceasing admiration. In the representation of
the sacrifice of Jephtha's Daughter, a print done from a painting of
Ant. Coypel, at one glance of the eye we read all the interesting
passages of the last act of a well-written tragedy; so much poetry is
there condensed into a moment of time.</P>

<P>Will you now oblige me with an account of the relationship
between Poetry, and her other sister, Music?</P>

<PB N="137" REF="518"/>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the poetry of our language I don't think we are to look for
any thing analogous to the notes of the gamut; for, except perhaps
in a few exclamations or interrogations, we are at liberty to raise
or sink our voice an octave or two at pleasure, without altering the
sense of the words. Hence, if either poetry or prose be read in me∣lodious
tones of voice, as is done in recitativo, or in chaunting, it
must depend on the speaker, not on the writer: for though words
may be selected which are less harsh than others, that is, which
have fewer sudden stops or abrupt consonants amongst the vowels,
or with fewer sibilant letters, yet this does not constitute melody,
which consists of agreeable successions of notes referrable to the
gamut; or harmony, which consists of agreeable combinations of
them. If the Chinese language has many words of similar articula∣tion,
which yet signify different ideas, when spoken in a higher or
lower musical note, as some travellers affirm, it must be capable of
much finer effect, in respect to the audible part of poetry, than any
language we are acquainted with.</P>
<P>There is however another affinity, in which poetry and music
more nearly resemble each other than has generally been understood,
and that is in their measure or time. There are but two kinds
of time acknowledged in modern music, which are called <HI>triple
time,</HI> and <HI>common time.</HI> The former of these is divided by bars,
each bar containing three crotchets, or a proportional number of
their subdivisions into quavers and semiquavers. This kind of time
is analogous to the measure of our heroic or iambic verse. Thus the
two following couplets are each of them divided into five bars
of <HI>triple time,</HI> each bar consisting of two crotchets and two quavers;
nor can they be divided into bars analogous to <HI>common time</HI> without
the bars interfering with some of the crotchets, so as to divide them.</P>
<Q><L>3/4 Soft-warbling beaks | in each bright blos | som move,</L>
<L>And vo | cal rosebuds thrill | the inchanted grove, |</L></Q>
<P><PB N="138" REF="519"/>
In these lines there is a quaver and a crochet alternately in every
bar, except in the last, in which <HI>the in</HI> make two semiquavers; the <HI>e</HI>
is supposed by Grammarians to be cut off, which any one's ear will
readily determine not to be true.</P>
<Q><L>3/4 Life buds or breathes | from Indus to | the poles,</L>
<L>And the | vast surface kind | les, as it rolls. |</L></Q>
<P>In these lines there is a quaver and a crotchet alternately in the
sirst bar; a quaver, two crotchets, and a quaver, make the second bar.
In the third bar there is a quaver, a crotchet, and a rest after the
crotchet, that is, after the word <HI>poles,</HI> and two quavers begin the
next line. The fourth bar consists of quavers and crotchets alter∣nately.
In the last bar there is a quaver, and a rest after it, viz.
after the word <HI>kindles;</HI> and then two quavers and a crotchet. You
will clearly perceive the truth of this, if you prick the musical cha∣racters
above mentioned under the verses.</P>
<P>The <HI>common time</HI> of musicians is divided into bars, each of which
contains four crotchets, or a proportional number of their subdivision
into quavers and semiquavers. This kind of musical time is analo∣gous
to the dactyle verses of our language, the most popular instances
of which are in Mr. Anstie's Bath-Guide. In this kind of verse the
bar does not begin till after the first or second syllable; and where
the verse is quite complete, and written by a good ear, these first syl∣lables
added to the last complete the bar, exactly in this also corre∣sponding
with many pieces of music;
<Q><L>2/4 Yet | if one may guess by the | size of his calf, Sir,</L>
<L>He | weighs about twenty-three | stone and a half, Sir.</L></Q>
<Q><L>2/4 Master | Mamozet's head was not | finished so soon,</L>
<L>For it | took up the barber a | whole afternoon.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="520"/>
In these lines each bar consists of a crotchet, two quavers, another
crotchet, and two more quavers: which are equal to four crotchets,
and, like many bars of <HI>common time</HI> in music, may be subdivided into
two in beating time without disturbing the measure.</P>
<P>The following verses from Shenstone belong likewise to common
time:
<Q><L>2/4 A | river or a sea |</L>
<L>Was to him a dish | of tea,</L>
<L>And a king | dom bread and butter.</L></Q></P>
<P>The first and second bars consist each of a crotchet, a quaver, a
crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet. The third bar consists of a quaver,
two crotchets, a quaver, a crotchet. The last bar is not complete
without adding the letter A, which begins the first line, and then it
consists of a quaver, a crotchet, a quaver, a crotchet, two quavers.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that the crotchets in triple time are in general
played by musicians slower than those of common time, and hence
minuets are generally pricked in triple time, and country dances ge∣nerally
in common time. So the verses above related, which are
analogous to <HI>triple time,</HI> are generally read slower than those analo∣gous
to <HI>common time;</HI> and are thence generally used for graver com∣positions.
I suppose all the different kinds of verses to be found in
our odes, which have any measure at all, might be arranged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
one or other of these two musical times; allowing a note or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
sometimes to precede the commencement of the bar, and occasional
rests, as in musical compositions: if this was attended to by those
who set poetry to music, it is probable the sound and sense would
oftener coincide. Whether these musical times can be applied to the
lyric and heroic verses of the Greek and Latin poets, I do not pre∣tend
to determine; certain it is, that the dactyle verse of our lan∣guage,
when it is ended with a double rhime, much resembles the
measure of Homer and Virgil, except in the length of the lines.</P>

<P>There is at least a mathematical relationship, or perhaps I ought rather to have said a metaphysical relationship between them.
Sir Isaac Newton has observed, that the breadths of the seven primary
colours in the Sun's image refracted by a prism are proportional to
the seven musical notes of the gamut, or to the intervals of the eight
sounds contained in an octave, that is, proportional to the following
numbers:

<P>Newton's Optics, Book I, part 2. prop. 3 and 6. Dr. Smith, in his
Harmonics, has an explanatory note upon this happy discovery, as he
terms it, of Newton. Sect. 4. Art. 7.</P>
<P>From this curious coincidence, it has been proposed to produce a
luminous music, consisting of successions or combinations of colours,
analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above mentioned.
This might be performed by a strong light, made by means of Mr.
Argand's lamps, passing through coloured glasses, and falling on
a defined part of a wall, with moveable blinds before them, which
might communicate with the keys of a harpsichord; and thus pro∣duce
at the same time visible and audible music in unison with each
other.</P>
<P>The execution of this idea is said by Mr. Guyot to have been at∣tempted
by Father Caffel without much success.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="522"/>
If this should be again attempted, there is another curious coinci∣dence
between sounds and colours, discovered by Dr. Darwin of
Shrewsbury, and explained in a paper on what he calls <HI>Ocular Spectra,</HI>
in the Philosophical Transactions, Vol. LXXVI. which might much
facilitate the execution of it. In this treatise the Doctor has demon∣strated,
that we see certain colours, not only with greater ease and
distinctness, but with relief and pleasure, after having for some time
contemplated other certain colours; as green after red, or red after
green; orange after blue, or blue after orange; yellow after violet,
or violet after yellow. This he shews arises from the <HI>ocular spectrum</HI>
of the colour last viewed coinciding with the <HI>irritation</HI> of the colour
now under contemplation. Now as the pleasure we receive from
the sensation of melodious notes, independent of the previous asso∣ciations
of agreeable ideas with them, must arise from our hearing
some proportions of sounds after others more easily, distinctly, or
agreeably; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of
the primary colours, and the primary sounds, if they may be so
called; he argues, that the same laws must govern the sensations of
both. In this circumstance, therefore, consists the sisterhood of Music
and Painting; and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors
from each other; musicians to speak of the brilliancy of sounds,
and the light and shade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony
of colours, and the tone of a picture. Thus it was not quite so ab∣surd,
as was imagined, when the blind man asked if the colour
scarlet was like the sound of a trumpet. As the coincidence or op∣position
of these <HI>ocular spectra,</HI> (or colours which remain in the eye
after having for some time contemplated a luminous object) are
more easily and more accurately ascertained, now their laws have
been investigated by Dr. Darwin, than the <HI>relicts</HI> of evanescent sounds
upon the ear; it is to be wished that some ingenious musician would
further cultivate this curious field of science: for if visible music
can be agreeably produced, it would be more easy to add sentiment
to it by the representations of groves and Cupids, and sleeping
<PB N="142" REF="523"/>
nymphs amid the changing colours, than is commonly done by the
words of audible music.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mentioned the greater length of the verses of Homer and
Virgil. Had not these poets great advantage in the superiority of
their languages compared to our own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is probable, that the introduction of philosophy into a
country must gradually affect the language of it; as philosophy con∣verses
in more appropriated and abstracted terms; and thus by de∣grees
eradicates the abundance of metaphor, which is used in the
more early ages of society. Otherwise, though the Greek compound
words have more vowels in proportion to their consonants than the
English ones, yet the modes of compounding them are less general;
as may be seen by variety of instances given in the preface of the
Translators, prefixed to the SYSTEM OF VEGETABLES by the Lich∣field
Society; which happy property of our own language rendered
that translation of Linneus as expressive and as concise, perhaps more
so than the original.</P>
<P>And in one respect, I believe, the Engish language serves the pur∣pose
of poetry better than the antient ones, I mean in the greater
ease of producing personifications; for as our nouns have in general
no genders affixed to them in prose-compositions, and in the habits
of conversation, they become easily personified only by the addition
of a masculine or feminine pronoun, as,
<Q><L>Pale Melancholy sits, and round <HI>her</HI> throws</L>
<L>A death-like silence, and a dread repose.</L>
<BIBL>Pope's Abelard.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="524"/>
And secondly, as most of our nouns have the article <HI>a</HI> or <HI>the</HI> prefixed
to them in prose-writing and in conversation, they in general become
personisied even by the omission of these articles; as in the bold
figure of Shipwreck in Miss Seward's Elegy on Capt. Cook:
<Q><L>But round the steepy rocks and dangerous strand</L>
<L>Rolls the white surf, and SHIPWRECK guards the land.</L></Q></P>
<P>Add to this, that if the verses in our heroic poetry be shorter than
those of the ancients, our words likewise are shorter; and in respect
to their measure or time, which has erroneously been called melody
and harmony, I doubt, from what has been said above, whether we
are so much inferior as is generally believed;since many passages,
which have been stolen from antient poets, have been translated into
our language without losing any thing of the beauty of the ver∣sification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear you acknowledge the thefts of the modern
poets from the antient ones, whose works I suppose have been
reckoned lawful plunder in all ages. But have not you borrowed
epithets, phrases, and even half a line occasionally from modern
poems?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be difficult to mark the exact boundary of what should
be termed plagiarism: where the sentiment and expression are both
borrowed without due acknowledgement, there can be no doubt;—
single words, on the contrary, taken from other authors, cannot con∣vict
a writer of plagiarism; they are lawful game, wild by nature,
the property of all who can capture them;—and perhaps a few
common flowers of speech may be gathered, as we pass over our
<PB N="144" REF="525"/>
neighbour's inclosure, without stigmatizing us with the title of
thieves; but we must not therefore plunder his cultivated fruit.</P>
<P>The four lines at the end of the plant Upas are imitated from Dr.
Young's Night Thoughts. The line in the episode adjoined to Cassia,
"The salt tear mingling with the milk he sips," is from an interest∣ing
and humane passage in Langhorne's Justice of Peace. There are
probably many others, which, if I could recollect them, should here
be acknowledged. As it is, like exotic plants, their mixture with
the natives ones, I hope, adds beauty to my Botanic Garden:—and
such as it is, <HI>Mr. Bookseller,</HI> I now leave it to you to desire the Ladies
and Gentlemen to walk in; but please to apprize them, that, like
the spectators at an unskilful exhibition in some village-barn, I hope
they will make Good-humour one of their party; and thus their∣selves
supply the defects of the representation.</P>

It expands a most exquisitely beautiful corol, and emits a most fragrant odour for a few hours in the night, and then closes to open no more. The flower is nearly a foot in diameter; the inside of the calyx of a splendid yellow, and the numerous petals of a pure white: it begins to open about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, and clsoses before sun-rise in the morning. Martyn's Letters, p. 294. The Cistus labdiniferus, and many other flowers, lose their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the day-time; for in these plants the stigma is soon impregnated by the numerous anthers: in many flowers of the Cistus lubdiniferus I ob∣served two or three of the stamens were perpetually bent into contact with the pistil.</P>
<P>The Nyctanthes, called Arabian Jasmine, is another flower, which expands a beau∣tiful corol, and gives out a most delicate perfume during the night, and not in the day, in its native country, whence its name; botanical philosophers have not yet explained this wonderful property; perhaps the plant sleeps during the day as some animals do; and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expansion of the petals; that is, during its waking hours: the Geranium trisle has the same property of giving up its fragrance only in the night. The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are said to close when the sun shines upon them. In our climate many flowers, as tragopogon, and hibiscus, close their flowers before the hottest part of the day comes on; and the flowers of some species of cucubalus, and Silene, viscous campion, are closed all day; but when the sun leaves them they expand, and emit a very agreeable scent; whence such plants are termed noctiflora.</P></NOTE><MILESTONE N="15"/></L>

Lin. Spec. Plantar. p. 490. Swedish Acts for the year 1762. Pulteney's View of Linncus, p. 220. Nor is this more won∣derful than that the electric eel and torpedo should give voluntary shocks of electricity; and in this plant perhaps, as in those animals, it may be a mode of defence, by which it harrasses or destroys the night-flying insects which infest it; and probably it may emit the same sparks during the day, which must be then invisible. This curious subject deserves further investigation. See Dictamnus. The ceasing to shine of this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive, that it absorbed and emitted light, like the Bolognian Phosphorus, or calcined oyster-shells, so well explained by Mr. B. Wilson, and by T. B. Beccari. Exper. on Phosphori, by B. Wilson. Dodsley. The light of the evening, at the same distance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly ob∣served, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I suppose, to the phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies, in a greater or less degree, which thus absorb light during the sun-shine, and continue to emit it again for some time afterwards, though not in such quantity as to produce apparent scintillations. The nectary of this plant grows from what is supposed to be the calyx; but this supposed calyx is coloured; and per∣haps, from this circumstance of its bearing the nectary, should rather be esteemed a part of the coral.

The herbs of this order of vegetables support the countless tribes of gramini∣vorous animals. The seeds of the smaller kinds of grasses, as of aira, poa, briza, stipa, &amp;c. are the sustenance of many sorts of birds. The seeds of the large grasses, as of wheat, barley, rye, oats, supply food to the human species.</P>
<P>It seems to have required more ingenuity to think of seeding nations of mankind with so small a seed, than with the potatoe of Mexico, or the bread-fruit of the southern islands; hence Ceres in Egypt, which was the birth-place of our European arts, was deservedly celebrated amongst their divinities, as well as Osyris, who invented the Plough.</P>
<P>Mr. Wahlborn observes, that as wheat, rye, and many of the grasses, and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filments, and thus expose the enclosed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains, a scarcity of corn is produced by wet summers; hence the necessity of a careful choice of seed-wheat, as that, which had not received the dust of the anthers, will not grow, though it may appear well to the eye.

<P>Some snowdrop-roots taken up in winter, and boiled, had the insipid mucilaginous taste of the Orchis, and, if cured in the same manner, would probably make as good salep. The roots of the Hyacinth, I am informed, are equally insipid, and might be used as an article of food. Gmelin, in his History of Siberia, says the Martigon Lily makes a part of the food of that country, which is of the same natural order as the snowdrop. Some roots of Crocus, which I boiled, had a disagreeable flavour.</P>
<P>The difficulty of raising the Orchis from seed has, perhaps, been a principal reason of its not being cultivated in this country as an article of food. It is affirmed, by one of the Linnean school, in the Amoenit. Academ. that the seeds of Orchis will ripen, if you destroy the new bulb; and that Lily of the Valley, Convallaria, will produce many more seeds, and ripen them, if the roots be crowded in a garden-pot, so as to prevent them from producing many bulbs. Vol. VI. p. 120. It is probable either of these me∣thods may succeed with these and other bulbous-rooted plants, as snowdrops, and might render their cultivation profitable in this climate. The root of the asphodelus ramosus, branchy asphodel, is used to feed swine in France; and starch is obtained from the al∣stromeria licta. Memoires d'Agricult.</P></NOTE></L>

The arguments which tend to shew that the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by deep subterraneous fires, and after∣wards condensed between the strata of the mountains, appear to me much more con∣clusive, than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of the earth: for, 1st, their heat has kept accurately the same perhaps for many centu∣ries, certainly as long as we have been possessed of good thermometers; which cannot be well explained, without supposing that they are first in a boiling state. For as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts of the earth 48, it is easy to understand, that the steam raised from boiling water, after being condensed in some mountain, and passing from thence through a certain space of the cold earth, must be cooled always to a given degree; and it is probable the distance from the exit of the spring, to the place where the steam is condensed, might be guessed by the degree of its warmth.</P>
<P>2. In the dry summer of 1780, when all other springs were either dry or much di∣minished, those of Buxton and Matlock (as I was well informed on the spot), had suf∣fered no diminution; which proves that the sources of these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the earth.</P>

(The blooming FUCUS), in her sparry coves<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Fucus.</HI> l. 191. Clandestine marriage. A species of Fucus, or of Conserva, soon appears in all basons which contain water. Dr. Priestley found that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particu∣larly in the sunshine, and that hence it contributed to preserve the water in reservoirs from becoming putrid. The minute divisions of the leaves of subaquatic plants, as men∣tioned in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fish, seem to serve another purpose be∣sides that of increasing their surface, which has not, I believe, been attended to, and that is to facilitate the separation of the air, which is mechanically mixed or chemically dis∣solved in water by their points or edges; this appears on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh from a pump; innumerable globules like quicksilver appear on almost every point; for the extremities of these points attract the particles of water less forcibly than those particles attract each other; hence the contained air, whose elasticity was but just balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles of water to each other, finds at the point of each fibre a place where the resistance to its expansion is less; and in consequence it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is easy to foresee that the rays of the sunshine, by being refracted and in part reflected by the two surfaces of these minute air-bubbles, must impart to them much more heat than to the transparent water; and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding them; that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water less than they attract each other, is seen by the spherical form of dew-drops on the points of grass.

<L>Emerging TRAPA lifts her pearly head;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Trapa.</HI> l. 200. Four males, one female. The lower leaves of this plant grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their footstalks to support them above the surface of the water. As the aërial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by ex∣posing a large surface of vessels with their contained fluids to the influence of the air; so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose like the gills of fish; and perhaps gain from water or give to it a similar material. As the material thus necessary to life seems to abound more in air than in water, the subaquatic leaves of this plant, and of sisym∣brium, coenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and some others, are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface; whilst those above water are undivided. So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as pimpinella, petrose∣linum, and others, because here the air is thinner, and thence a larger surface of contact is required. The stream of water also passes but once along the gills of fish, as it is sooner deprived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and ejected by the action of the lungs of land-animals. The whale seems to be an exception to the above, as he receives water and spouts it out again from an organ, which I suppose to be a respiratory one. As spring-water is nearly of the same degree of heat in all climates, the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-cress, water-parsnip, ranunculus, and many others.</P>
<P>In warmer climates the watery grounds are usefully cultivated, as with rice; and the roots of some aquatic plants are said to have supplied food, as the antient Lotus in Egypt, which some have supposed to be the Nymphaea.—In Siberia the roots of the Butomus, or flowering rush, are eaten, which is well worth further enquiry, as they grow spontane∣ously in our ditches and rivers, which at present produce no esculent vegetables; and might thence become an article of useful cultivation. Herodotus affirms, that the Egyp∣tian Lotos grows in the Nile, and resembles a Lily. That the natives dry it in the sun, and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it for bread. Enterpe.

The Abbè Molina, in his History of Chili, translated from the Italian by the Abbè Grewvel, mentions a spe∣cies of Basil, which he calls Ocymum salinum: he says it resembles the common basil, except that the stalk is round and jointed; and that though it grows 60 miles from the sea, yet every morning it is covered with saline globules, which are hard and splendid, appearing at a distance like dew; and that each plant furnishes about half an ounce of fine salt every day, which the peasants collect, and use as common salt, but esteem it superior in flavour.</P>
<P>As an article of diet, salt seems to act simply as a stimulus, not containing any nou∣rishment, and is the only fossil substance which the caprice of mankind has yet taken into their stomachs along with their food; and, like all other unnatural stimuli, is not necessary to people in health, and contributes to weaken our system; though it may be useful as a medicine. It seems to be the immediate cause of the sea scurvy, as those patients quickly recover by the use of fresh provisions; and is probably a remote cause of scrophula (which consists in the want of irritability in the absorbent vessels), and is therefore serviceable to these patients; as wine is necessary to those whose stomachs have been weakened by its use. The universality of the use of salt with our food, and in our cookery, has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of these observations. I sus∣pect that flesh-meat cut into thin slices, either raw or boiled, might be preserved in coarse sugar or treacle; and thus a very nourishing and salutary diet might be presented to our seamen. See note on Salt-rocks, in Vol. I. Canto II. If a person unaccustomed to much salt should eat a couple of red-herrings, his insensible perspiration will be so much increased by the stimulus of the salt, that he will find it necessary in about two hours to drink a quart of water: the effects of a continued use of salt in weakening the action of the lymphatic system may hence be deduced.</P></NOTE></L>

<P>The singular and wonderful structure of this flower has occasioned many disputes amongst botanists. See Tourniff. Malpig. Dillen. Rivin. &amp;c. The receptacle is en∣larged into a naked club, with the germs at its base; the stamens are affixed to the re∣ceptacle amidst the germs (a natural prodigy), and thus do not need the assistance of elevating filaments: hence the flower may be said to be inverted. <HI>Families of Plants</HI> translated from Linneus, p. 618.</P>
<P>The spadix of this plant is frequently quite white, or coloured, and the leaves liable to be streaked with white, and to have black or scarlet blotches on them. As the plant has no corol or blossom, it is probable the coloured juices in these parts of the sheath or leaves may serve the same purpose as the coloured juices in the petals of other flowers; from which I suppose the honey to be prepared. See note on Helleborus. I am informed that those tulip-roots which have a red cuticle produce red flowers. See Rubia.</P>
<P>When the petals of the tulip become striped with many colours, the plant loses almost half of its height; and the method of making them thus break into colours is by tran∣splanting them into a meagre or sandy soil, <HI>after they have previously enjoyed a richer soil:</HI> hence it appears, that the plant is weakened when the flower becomes variegated.

There is a kind of pink called Fairchild's mule, which is here supposed to be produced between a Dianthus superbus, and the Caryophyllus, Clove. The Dianthus superbus emits a most fragrant odour, particularly at night. Vegetable mules supply an irrefragable argument in favour of the sexual sys∣tem of botany. They are said to be numerous; and, like the mules of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their species by seed. There is an account of a curious mule from the Antirrhinum linaria, Toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. V. I. No. 3. and many hybrid plants described in No. 32. The Urtica alienata is an evergreen plant, which appears to be a nettle from the male flowers, and a Pellitory (Parietaria) from the female ones and the fruit; and is hence between both. Murray, Syst. Veg. Amongst the English indigenous plants, the veronica hybrida mule Speedwel is supposed to have originated from the officinal one; and the spiked one, and the Sibthorpia Euro∣paea to have for its parents the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort. Pulteney's View of Linneus, p. 250. Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramstrom, seem of opinion, that the internal structure or parts of fructification in mule-plants resemble the female parent; but that the habit or external structure resembles the male parent. See treatises under the above names in V. VI. Amaenit. Academic. The mule produced from a horse and the ass resembles the horse externally with his ears, main, and tail; but with the nature or manners of an ass: but the Hinnus, or creature produced from a male ass, and a mare, resembles the father externally in stature, ash-colour, and the black cross, but with the nature or manners of a horse. The breed from Spanish rams and Swedish ewes resembled the Spanish sheep in wool, stature, and external form; but was as hardy as the Swedish sheep; and the contrary of those which were produced from Swedish rams and Spanish ewes. The offspring from the male goat of Angora and the Swedish female goat had long soft camel's hair; but that from the male Swedish goat, and the female one of Angora, had no improvement of their wool. An English ram without horns, and a Swedish horned ewe, produced sheep without horns. Amoen. Academ. V. VI. p. 13.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Save where the dry Harmattan breathes and kills;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The dry Harmattan.</HI> l. 324. The Harmattan is a singular wind blowing from the in∣terior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for several days without regular periods. It is always attended with a fog or haze, so dense as to render those objects invisible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile; the sun appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute red, and very minute par∣ticles subside from the misty air so as to make the grass, and the skins of negroes appear whitish. The extreme dryness which attends this wind or fog, without dews, withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables; and is said of Dr. Lind at some seasons to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after much preceding wet, when it may be∣come loaded with the exhalations from putrid marshes; at other seasons it is said to check epidemic diseases, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; which is probably effected by its yielding no moisture to the mouths of the external absorbent vessels, by which the action of the other branches of the absorbent system is increased to supply the deficiency, <HI>Account of the Harmattan. Phil. Transact. V. LXXl.</HI></P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight hours at Detroit in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the sun appeared as red as blood, and thrice its usual size: some rain falling, covered white paper with dark drops, like sulphur or dirt, which burnt like wet gunpowder, and the air had a very sulphureous smell. He supposes this to have been emitted from some distant earthquake or volcano. Philos. Trans. V. LIII. p. 63.</P>
<P>In many circumstances this wind seems much to resemble the dry fog which covered most parts of Europe for many weeks in the summer of 1780, which has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin, as it succeeded the violent eruption of Mount Heela, and its neighbourhood. From the subsidence of a white powder, it seems probable that the Harmattan has a similar origin, from the unexplored mountains of Africa. Nor is it improbable, that the epidemic coughs, which occasionally traverse immense tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic eruptions; nor impossible, that at some future time contagious miasmata may be thus emitted from subterraneous furnaces, in such abundance as to contaminate the whole atmosphere, and depopulate the earth!</P></NOTE></L>

This was supposed to have been caused by the great evaporation, and the defi∣ciency of fresh water rivers having rendered the sea too salt for its inhabitants.

Chundali Borrum is the name which the natives give to this plant; it is the Hedysarum gyrans, or moving plant; its class is two brotherhoods, ten males. Its leaves are continually in spontaneous motion; some rising and others falling; and others whirling circularly by twisting their stems; this spontaneous movement of the leaves, when the air is quite still and very warm, seems to be necessary to the plant, as perpetual respiration is to animal life. A more particular account, with a good print of the Hedysarum gyrans is given by M. Broussonet in a paper on vegetable motions in the Histoire de l'Academic des Sciences. Ann. 1784, p. 609.</P>
<P>There are many other instances of spontaneous movements of the parts of vegetables. In the Marchantia polymorpha some yellow wool proceeds from the flower-bearing an∣thers, which moves spontaneously in the anther, while it drops its dust like atoms. Murray, Syst. Veg. See note on Collinsonia for other instances of vegetable spon∣taneity. Add to this, that as the sleep of animals consists in a suspension of voluntary motion, and as vegetables are likewise subject to sleep, there is reason to conclude, that the various actions of opening and closing their petals and soliage may be justly ascribed to a voluntary power: for without the faculty of volition, sleep would not have been necessary to them.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Closed in an azure fig by fairy spells,</L>
<L>Bosom'd in down, fair CAPRI-FICA dwells;—<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Caprificus.</HI> l. 408. Wild fig. The fruit of the fig is not a seed-vessel, but a recep∣tacle inclosing the flower within it. As these trees bear some male and others female flowers, immured on all sides by the fruit, the manner of their fecundation was very un∣intelligible, till Tournesort and Pontedera discovered, that a kind of gnat produced in the male figs carried the secundating dust on its wings, (Cynips Psenes Syst. Nat. 919.), and, penetrating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers; for the evidence of this wonderful fact, see the word Caprification, in Milne's Botanical Dictionary. The figs of this country are all female, and their seeds not prolific; and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and suckers.</P>
<P>Monsieur de la Hire has shewn in the Memoir. de l'Academ. de Science, that the summer figs of Paris, in Provence, Italy, and Malta, have all perfect stamina, and ripen not only their fruits, but their seed; from which seed other fig-trees are raised; but that the stamina of the autumnal figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of due warmth. Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), says, that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the same co∣vering or receptacle; which in warmer climates perform their proper office, but in colder ones become abortive. And Linneus observes, that some figs have the navel of the receptacle open; which was one reason that induced him to remove this plant from the class Clandestine Marriage to the class Polygamy. Lin. Spec. Plant.</P>
<P>From all these circumstances I should conjecture, that those female fig-flowers, which are closed on all sides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones, are monsters, which have been propagated for their fruit, like barberries, and grapes without seeds in them; and that the Caprification is either an antient process of imaginary use, and blindly followed in some countries, or that it may contribute to ripen the fig by de∣creasing its vigour, like cutting off a circle of the bark from the branch of a pear-tree. Tournefort seems inclined to this opinion; who says, that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen sooner, if their buds be pricked with a straw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by some insects ripen sooner, and the part round the puncture is sweeter. Is not the honey-dew produced by the puncture of insects? will not wounding the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the blossoms from falling off; as from some fig-trees the fruit is said to fall off unless they are wounded by caprification? I had last spring six young trees of the Ischia fig with fruit on them in pots in a slove; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded very vigorous shoots, and the fig all fell off; which I ascribed to the increased vigour of the plants.</P></NOTE></L>

Thus hollow oak-trees and willows are often seen with the whole wood decayed and gone; and yet the few remaining branches flourish with vigour; but in respect to the male and female parts of a flower, they do not destroy its individuality any more than the number of paps of a sow, or the number of her coty∣ledons, each of which includes one of her young.</P>

<P>P. 7. <HI>Additional note to Curcuma.</HI> These anther-less filaments seem to be an endea∣vour
of the plant to produce more stamens, as would appear from some experiments of
M. Reynier, instituted for another purpose: he cut away the stamens of many flowers,
with design to prevent their secundity, and in many instances the flower threw out new
filaments from the wounded part of different lengths; but did not produce new anthers.
The experiments were made on the geum rivale, different kinds of mallows, and the
aechinops ritro. Critical Review for March, 1788.</P>
<P>P. 8. <HI>Addition to the note on Iris.</HI> In the Persian Iris the end of the lower petal is
purple, with white edges and orange streaks, creeping, as it were, into the mouth of the
flower like an insect; by which deception in its native climate it probably prevents a
similar insect from plundering it of its honey: the edges of the lower petal lap over
those of the upper one, which prevents it from opening too wide on fine days, and fa∣cilitates
its return at night; whence the rain is excluded, and the air admitted. See Po∣lymorpha,
Rubia, and Cypripedia in Vol. I.</P>
<P>P. 12. <HI>Additional note on Chondrilla.</HI> In the natural state of the expanded flower of
the barberry, the stamens lie on the petals; under the concave summits of which the
anthers shelter themselves, and in this situation remain perfectly rigid; but on touch∣ing
the inside of the filament near its base with a fine bristle, or blunt needle, the
stamen instantly bends upwards, and the anther, embracing the stigma, sheds its dust.

<P>P. 15. <HI>Addition to the note on Silene.</HI> I saw a plant of the Dionaea Muscipula, Fly-trap
of Venus, this day, in the collection of Mr. Boothby at Ashbourn-Hall, Derby∣shire,
Aug. 20th, 1788; and on drawing a straw along the middle of the rib of the
leaves as they lay upon the ground round the stem, each of them, in about a second of
time, closed and doubled itself up, crossing the thorns over the opposite edge of the leaf,
like the teeth of a spring rap-trap: of this plant I was savoured with an elegant co∣loured
drawing, by Miss Maria Jackson of Tarporly, in Cheshire, a Lady who adds
much botanical knowledge to many other elegant acquirements.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="569"/>
In the Apocynum Androsaemifolium, one kind of Dog's bane, the anthers converge
over the nectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles surrounding the germ;
and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the interstice between each anther.
But when a fly inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey, they
converge closer, and with such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally pe∣rishes.
This account was related to me by R. W. Darwin, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Elston, in
Nottinghamshire, who showed me the plant in flower, July 2d, 1788, with a fly thus
held fast by the end of its proboscis, and was well seen by a magnifying lens, and which
in vain repeatedly struggled to disengage itself, till the converging anthers were separated
by means of a pin: on some days he had observed that almost every flower of this ele∣gant
plant had a fly in it thus entangled; and a few weeks afterwards favoured me with
his further observations on this subject.</P>
<P><Q>My Apocynum is not yet out of flower. I have often visited it, and have frequently
found four or five flies, some alive, and some dead, in its flowers; they are generally
caught by the trunk or proboscis, sometimes by the trunk and a leg; there is one at
present only caught by a leg: I don't know that this plant sleeps, as the flowers re∣main
open in the night; yet the flies frequently make their escape. In a plant of
Mr. Ordino's, an ingenious gardener at Newark, who is possessed of a great collection
of plants, I saw many flowers of an Apocynum with three dead flies in each; they
are a thin-bodied fly, and rather less than the common house-fly; but I have seen two
or three other sorts of flies thus arrested by the plant. Aug. 12, 1788.</Q></P>
<P>P. 18. <HI>Additional note on Ilex.</HI> The efficient cause which renders the hollies
prickly in Needwood Forest only as high as the animals can reach them, may arise from
the lower branches being constantly cropped by them, and thus shoot forth more luxu∣riant
soliage: it is probable the shears in garden-hollies may produce the same effect,
which is equally curious, as prickles are not thus produced on other plants.</P>
<P>P. 41. <HI>Additional note on Ulva.</HI> M. Hubert made some observations on the air
contained in the cavities of the bambou. The stems of these canes were from 40 to 50
feet in height, and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and might contain about 30 pints of
elastic air. He cut a bambou, and introduced a lighted candle into the cavity, which
was extinguished immediately on its entrance. He tried this about 60 times in a cavity
of the bambou, containing about two pints. He introduced mice at different times into
these cavities, which seemed to be somewhat affected, but soon recovered their agility.
The stem of the bambou is not hollow till it rises more than one foot from the earth;
the divisions between the cavities are convex downwards. Observ. sur la Physique par

has been observed on certain fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wers, by M. Haggren, Lecturer in Natural History.
One evening he perceived a faint flash of light repeatedly dart from a Marigold; sur∣prized
at such an uncommon appearance, he resolved to examine it with attention; and,
to be assured that it was no deception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders
to make a signal at the moment when he observed the light. They both saw it con∣stantly
at the same moment.</P>
<P>The light was most brilliant on Marigolds, of an orange or flame colour; but scarcely
visible on pale ones.</P>
<P>The flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three times in quick succession,
but more commonly at intervals of several minutes; and when several slowers in the same
place emitted their light together, it could be observed at a considerable distance.</P>
<P>This phaenomenon was remarked in the months of July and Augst, at sun-set, and
for half an hour after, when the atmosphere was clear; but after a rainy day, or when
the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it was seen.</P>
<P>The following flowers emitted flashes, more or less vivid, in this order:</P>
<P>1. The Marigold, (<HI>Calendula Officinalis</HI>).</P>
<P>2. Garden Nasturtion, (Tropaeolum majus).</P>
<P>3. Orange Lily, (Lilium bulbiferum).</P>
<P>4. The Indian Pink, (Tagetes patula et crecta).</P>
<P>Sometimes it was also observed on the Sun-flowers, (H linthus annuus). But bright
yellow, or flame colour, seemed in general necessary for the production of this light; for
it was never seen on the flowers of any other colour.</P>
<P>To discover whether some little insects, or phosphoric worms, might not be the cause
of it, the flowers were carefully examined even with a microscope, without any such
being sound.</P>
<P>From the rapidity of the flash, and other circumstances, it might be conjectured, that
there is something of electricity in this phaenomenon. It is well known, that when the
<PB N="188" REF="571"/>
<HI>pistil</HI> of a flower is impregnated, the <HI>pollen</HI> bursts away by its elasticity, with which elec∣tricity
may be combined. But M. Haggren, after having observed the flash from the
Orange-lily, the <HI>anthers</HI> of which are a considerable space distant from the <HI>petals,</HI> found
that the light proceeded from the <HI>petals</HI> only; whence he concludes, that this electric
light is caused by the <HI>pollen,</HI> which in flying off is scattered upon the <HI>petals.</HI> Obser.

<HEAD>Description of the Poison-Tree in the Island of JAVA. Translated from the original Dutch
of N. P. Foersch.</HEAD>
<P>THIS destructive tree is called in the Malayan language <HI>Bohon-Upas,</HI> and has been
described by naturalists; but their accounts have been so tinctured with the <HI>mar∣vellou,</HI>
that the whole narration has been supposed to be an ingenious fiction by the ge∣nerality
of readers. Nor is this in the least degree surprising, when the circumstances
which we shall faithfully relate in this description are considered.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge, that I long doubted the existence of this tree, until a stricter
enquiry convinced me of my error. I shall now only relate simple unadorned facts, of
which I have been an eye-witness. My readers may depend upon the fidelity of this
account. In the year 1774 I was stationed at Batavia, as a surgeon, in the service of the
Dutch East-India Company. During my residence there I received several different ac∣counts
of the Bohon Upas, and the violent effects of its poison. They all then seemed
incredible to me, but raised my curiosity in so high a degree, that I resolved to investi∣gate
this subject thoroughly, and to trust only to my own observations. In consequence
of this resolution, I applied to the Governor-General, Mr. Petrus Albertus van der Parra,
for a pass to travel through the country: my request was granted; and, having procured
<PB N="189" REF="572"/>
every information, I set out on my expedition. I had procured a recommendation from
an old Malayan priest to another priest, who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to the
tree, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles distant. The letter proved of great service
to me in my undertaking, as that priest is appointed by the Emperor to reside there, in
order to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced to
approach the tree, and to procure the poison.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bohon-Upas</HI> is situated in the island of <HI>Java,</HI> about twenty-seven leagues from
<HI>Batavia,</HI> fourteen from <HI>Soura Charta,</HI> the seat of the Emperor, and between eighteen
and twenty leagues from <HI>Tinkjoe,</HI> the present residence of the Sultan of Java. It is sur∣rounded
on all sides by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it,
to the distance of ten or twelve miles from the tree, is entirely barren. Not a tree, nor
a shrub, nor even the least plant or grass is to be seen. I have made the tour all around
this dangerous spot, at about eighteen miles distant from the centre, and I found the
aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary. The easiest ascent of the hills is from
that part where the old ecclesiaslick dwells. From his house the criminals are sent for
the poison, into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped. It is of high
value, and produces a considerable revenue to the Emperor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Account of the manner in which the Poison is procured.</HEAD>
<P>The poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues out between the bark
and the tree itself, like the <HI>camphor.</HI> Malefactors, who for their crimes are sentenced
to die, are the only persons who fetch the poison; and this is the only chance they have
of saving their lives. After sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are
asked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or whether they
will go to the Upas tree for a box of poison? They commonly prefer the latter pro∣posal,
as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives, but also a certainty, in
case of their safe return, that a provision will be made for them in future by the Em∣peror.
They are also permitted to ask a favour from the Emperor, which is generally
of a triffing nature, and commonly granted. They are then provided with a silver or
tortoiseshell box, in which they are to put the poisonous gum, and are properly in∣structed
how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition. Among other
particulars, they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds; as they are to
go towards the tree before the wind, so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown
from them. They are told, likewise, to travel with the utmost dispatch, as that is the
only method of insuring a safe return. They are afterwards sent to the house of the old
priest, to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations. Here
they generally remain some days, in expectation of a favourable breeze. During that
time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="573"/>
When the hour of their departure arrives, the priest puts them on a long leather-cap,
with two glasses before their eyes, which comes down as far as their breast; and also
provides them with a pair of leather-gloves. They are then conducted by the priest,
and their friends and relations, about two miles on their journey. Here the priest re∣peats
his instructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He shews
them a hill, which they are told to ascend, and that on the other side they will find a
rivulet, which they are to follow, and which will conduct them directly to the Upas.
They now take leave of each other; and, amidst prayers for their success, the delin∣quents
hasten away.</P>
<P>The worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me, that during his residence there, for up∣wards
of thirty years, he had dismissed above seven hundred criminals in the manner
which I have described; and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned. He shewed
me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers, with the date of their departure from his
house annexed; and a list of the offences for which they had been condemned: to
which was added, a list of those who had returned in safety. I afterwards saw another
list of these culprits, at the jail-keeper's at <HI>Soura-Charta,</HI> and found that they perfectly
corresponded with each other, and with the different informations which I afterwards
obtained.</P>
<P>I was present at some of these melancholy ceremonies, and desired different delin∣quents
to bring with them some pieces of the wood, or a small branch, or some leaves
of this wonderful tree. I have also given them silk cords, desiring them to measure its
thickness. I never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one
of them on his return; and all I could learn from him, concerning the tree itself, was,
that it flood on the border of a rivulet, as described by the old priest; that it was of a
middling size; that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it; but
that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it; and that the ground was of a
brownish sand, full of stones, almost impracticable for travelling, and covered with
dead bodies. After many conversations with the old Malayan priest, I questioned him
about the first discovery, and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree; upon which he
gave me the following answer:</P>
<P><Q>We are told in our new Alcoran, that, above an hundred years ago, the country
around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of Sodom and
Gomorrha; when the great prophet Mahomet determined not to suffer them to lead
such detestable lives any longer, he applied to God to punish them: upon which God
caused this tree to grow out of the earth, which destroyed them all, and rendered the
country for ever uninhabitable.</Q></P>
<P>Such was the Malayan opinion. I shall not attempt a comment; but must observe,
that all the Malayans consider this tree as an holy instrument of the great prophet to
punish the sins of mankind; and, therefore, to die of the poison of the Upas is generally
<PB N="191" REF="574"/>
considered among them as an honourable death. For that reason I also observed, that
the delinquents, who were going to the tree, were generally dressed in their best apparel.</P>
<P>This however is certain, though it may appear incredible, that from fifteen to
eighteen miles round this tree, not only no human creature can exist, but that, in that
space of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered. I have also
been assured by several persons of veracity, that there are no fish in the waters, nor
has any rat, mouse, or any other vermin, been seen there; and when any birds fly so
near this tree that the effuvia reaches them, they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the
poison. This circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents, who, in their
return, have seen the birds drop down, and have picked them up <HI>dead,</HI> and brought
them to the old ecclesiastick.</P>
<P>I will here mention an instance, which proves them a fact beyond all doubt, and which
happened during my stay at Java.</P>
<P>In the year 1775 a rebellion broke out among the subjects of the Massay, a sove∣reign
prince, whose dignity is nearly equal to that of the Emperor. They refused to
pay a duty imposed upon them by their sovereign, whom they openly opposed. The
Massay sent a body of a thousand troops to disperse the rebels, and to drive them, with
their families, out of his dominions. Thus four hundred families, consisting of above
sixteen hundred souls, were obliged to leave their native country. Neither the Emperor
nor the Sultan would give them protection, not only because they were rebels, but also
through sear of displeasing their neighbour, the Massay. In this distressful situation,
they had no other resource than to repair to the uncultivated parts round the Upas, and
requested permission of the Emperor to settle there. Their request was granted, on
condition of their fixing their abode not more than twelve or fourteen miles from the
tree, in order not to deprive the inhabitants already settled there at a greater distance of
their cultivated lands. With this they were obliged to comply; but the consequence
was, that in less than two months their number was reduced to about three hundred.
The chiefs of those who remained returned to the Massay, informed him of their losses,
and intreated his pardon, which induced him to receive them again as subjects, thinking
them sufficiently punished for their misconduct. I have seen and conversed with several
of those who survived soon after their return. They all had the appearance of persons
tainted with an infectious disorder; they looked pale and weak, and from the account
which they gave of the loss of their comrades, of the symptoms and circumstances
which attended their dissolution, such as convulsions, and other signs of a violent death,
I was fully convinced that they fell victims to the poison.</P>
<P>This violent effect of the poison at so great a distance from the tree, certainly appears
surprising, and almost incredible; and especially when we consider that it is possible for
delinquents who approach the tree to return alive. My wonder, however, in a great
measure, ceased, after I had made the following observations:</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="575"/>
I have said before, that malefactors are instructed to go to the tree with the wind,
and to return against the wind. When the wind continues to blow from the same
quarter while the delinquent travels thirty, or six and thirty miles, if he be of a good
constitution, he certainly survives. But what proves the most destructive is, that there
is no dependence on the wind in that part of the world for any length of time.—There
are no regular land-winds; and the sea-wind is not perceived there at all, the situation
of the tree being at too great a distance, and surrounded by high mountains and uncul∣tivated
forests. Besides, the wind there never blows a fresh regular gale, but is com∣monly
merely a current of light, soft breezes, which pass through the different openings
of the adjoining mountains. It is also frequently difficult to determine from what part
of the globe the wind really comes, as it is divided by various obstructions in its passage,
which easily change the direction of the wind, and often totally destroy its effects.</P>
<P>I, therefore, impute the distant effects of the poison, in a great measure, to the con∣stant
gentle winds in those parts, which have not power enough to disperse the poisonous
particles. If high winds are more frequent and durable there, they would certainly
weaken very much, and even destroy the obnoxious effluvia of the poison; but without
them, the air remains infected and pregnant with these poisonous vapours.</P>
<P>I am the more convinced of this, as the worthy ecclesiastick assured me, that a dead
calm is always attended with the greatest danger, as there is a continual perspiration
issuing from the tree, which is seen to rise and spread in the air, like the putrid steam of
a marshy cavern.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Experiments made with the Gum of the UPAS-TREE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1776, in the month of February, I was present at the execution of thir∣teen
of the Emperor's concubines, at <HI>Soura-Charta,</HI> who were convicted of infidelity
to the Emperor's bed. It was in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, when the fair cri∣minals
were led into an open space within the walls of the Emperor's palace. There
the judge passed sentence upon them, by which they are doomed to suffer death by a
lancet poisoned with Upas. After this the Alcoran was presented to them, and they
were, according to the law of their great prophet Mahomet, to acknowledge and to
affirm by oath, that the charges brought against them, together with the sentence and
their punishment, were fair and equitable. This they did, by laying their right hand
upon the Alcoran, their left hands upon their breast, and their eyes lifted towards
heaven; the judge then held the Alcoran to their lips, and they kissed it.</P>
<P>These ceremonies over, the executioner proceeded on his business in the following
manner:—Thirteen posts, each about five feet high, had been previously erected. To
these the delinquents were fastened, and their breasts stripped naked. In this situation
they remained a short time in continual prayers, attended by several priests, until a signal
<PB N="193" REF="576"/>
was given by the judge to the executioner; on which the latter produced an instrument,
much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses. With this instrument,
it being poisoned with the gum of the Upas, the unhappy wretches were lanced in the
middle of their breasts, and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two
minutes.</P>
<P>My astonishment was raised to the highest degree, when I beheld the sudden effects
of that poison, for in about five minutes after they were lanced, they were taken with
a <HI>tremor,</HI> attended with a <HI>subsultus tendinum,</HI> after which they died in the greatest agonies,
crying out to God and Mahomet for mercy. In sixteen minutes by my watch, which I
held in my hand, all the criminals were no more. Some hours after their death, I ob∣served
their bodies full of livid spots, much like those of the <HI>Petech<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae,</HI> their faces swelled,
their colour changed to a kind of blue, their eyes looked yellow, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after this, I had an opportunity of seeing such another execution
at Samarang. Seven Malayans were executed there with the same instrument, and
in the same manner; and I found the operation of the poison, and the spots in their
bodies exactly the same.</P>
<P>These circumstances made me desirous to try an experiment with some animals, in
order to be convinced of the real effects of this poison; and as I had then two young
puppies, I thought them the fittest objects for my purpose. I accordingly procured with
great difficulty some grains of Upas. I dissolved half a grain of that gum in a small
quantity of arrack, and dipped a lancet into it. With this poisoned instrument I made
an incision in the lower muscular part of the belly in one of the puppies. Three minutes
after it received the wound the animal began to cry out most piteously, and ran as last as
possible from one corner of the room to the other. So it continued during six minutes,
when all its strength being exhausted, it fell upon the ground, was taken with convul∣sions,
and died in the eleventh minute. I repeated this experiment with two other pup∣pies,
with a cat, and a fowl, and found the operation of the poison in all of them the
same: none of these animals survived above thirteen minutes.</P>
<P>I thought it necessary to try also the effect of the poison given inwardly, which I
did in the following manner. I dissolved a quarter of a grain of the gum in half an
ounce of arrack, and made a dog of seven months old drink it. In seven minutes
a retching ensued, and I observed, at the same time, that the animal was delirious, as it
ran up and down the room, fell on the ground, and tumb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed about; then it rose again,
cried out very loud, and in about half an hour after was seized with convulsions, and
died. I opened the body, and found the stomach very much inflamed, as the intestines
were in some parts, but not so much as the stomach. There was a small quantity of
coagulated blood in the stomach; but I could discover no orifice from which it could
have issued; and therefore supposed it to have been squeezed cut of the lungs, by the
animal's straining while it was vomiting.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="577"/>
From these experiments I have been convinced that the gum of the Upas is the
most dangerous and most violent of all vegetable poisons; and I am apt to believe that
it greatly contributes to the unhealthiness of that island. Nor is this the only evil
attending it: hundreds of the natives of Java, as well as Europeans, are yearly destroyed
and treacherously murdered by that poison, either internally or externally. Every man
of quality or fashion has his dagger or other arms poisoned with it; and in times of war
the Malayans poison the springs and other waters with it; by this treacherous practice
the Dutch suffered greatly during the last war, as it occasioned the loss of half their
army. For this reason, they have ever since kept fish in the springs of which they drink
the water; and sentinels are placed near them, who inspect the waters every hour, to
see whether the fish are alive. If they march with an army or body of troops into an
enemy's country, they always carry live fish with them, which they throw into the
water some hours before they venture to drink it; by which means they have been able
to prevent their total destruction.</P>
<P>This account, I flatter myself, will satisfy the curiosity of my readers, and the few
facts which I have related will be considered as a certain proof of the existence of this
pernicious tree, and its penetrating effects.</P>
<P>If it be asked why we have not yet any more satisfactory accounts of this tree, I can
only answer, that the object to most travellers to that part of the world consists more in
commercial pursuits than in the study of Natural History and the advancement of
Sciences. Besides, Java is so universally reputed an unhealthy island, that rich travellers
seldom make any long stay in it; and other want money, and generally are too igno∣rant
of the language to travel, in order to make enquiries. In future, those who visit
this island will probably now be induced to make it an object of their researches, and
will furnish us with a fuller description of this tree.</P>
<P>I will therefore only add, that there exists also a sort of Cajoe-Upas on the coast of
Macassar, the poison of which operates nearly in the same manner, but is not half so
violent or malignant as that of Java, and of which I shall likewise give a more circum∣stantial
account in a description of that island.—<HI>London Magazine.</HI></P>
