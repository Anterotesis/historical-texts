<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E presume we want no Apology to the Reader for this Publica∣tion, but some may be thought needful to Mr <HI>Pope:</HI> However he cannot think our Offence so great as Theirs, who first separately publish∣ed what we have here but collected in a better Form and Order. As for the Letters we have procured to be added, they serve but to compleat, explain, and sometimes set in a true light, those others, which it was not in the Writer's or Our power to recall.</P>
<P>This Collection hath been owing to several Cabinets; some drawn from thence by Acci∣dents, and others (even of those to Ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of that Sex we are beholden for the whole Correspondence with <HI>H. C.</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which Letters being lent her by that Gentleman, she took the Liberty to print; as appears by the following, which we shall give at length, both as it is some∣thing curious, and as it may serve for an Apology for our selves.</P>

<P>AFTER so long a silence, as the ma∣ny and great oppressions I have sigh'd under has occasion'd, one is at a Loss how
<PB REF="10"/>
to begin a letter to so kind a friend as your self. But as it was always my resolution, if I must sink, to do it as decently [that is as silently] as I cou'd: so when I found my self plung'd into unforeseen, and una∣voidable ruin, I retreated from the world, and in a manner buried my self in a dis∣mal place, where I knew none, nor none knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I have protracted a lingring death, [for life it cannot be call'd] ever since you saw me, sequester'd from company, depriv'd of my books, and nothing left to converse with but the Letters of my dead, or absent, friends, amongst which latter I always plac'd your's, and Mr <HI>Pope</HI>'s, in the first rank. I lent some of them indeed to an ingenious per∣son, who was so delighted with the speci∣men, that he importuned me for a sight of the rest, which having obtained, he convey'd them to the Press, I must not say altogether with my consent, nor wholly without it. I thought them too good to be lost in oblivion, and had no cause to apprehend the disobliging of any. The publick, <HI>viz.</HI> all persons of taste and judg∣ment, wou'd be pleas'd with so agreeable an amusement; Mr <HI>Cromwell</HI> cou'd not be angry, since it was but justice to his merit, to publish the solemn, and private profes∣sions of Love, Gratitude, and Veneration,
<PB REF="11"/>
made him by so celebrated an Author; and surely Mr <HI>Pope</HI> ought not to resent the publication, since the early pregnancy of his Genius was no dishonour to his chara∣cter. And yet had either of you been ask'd, common modesty wou'd have oblig'd you to refuse, what you wou'd not be displeas'd with, if done without your knowledge: And besides to end all dispute, you had been pleas'd to make me a free gift of them, to do what I pleas'd with them: and every one knows that the person to whom a Let∣ter is address'd, has the same right to dis∣pose of it, as he has of goods purchas'd with his money. I doubt not but your ge∣nerosity and honour will do me the right, of owning by a line, that I came honestly by them. I flatter my self, in a few months I shall again be visible to the world, and when∣ever thro' good providence that Turn shall happen, I shall joyfully acquaint you with it, there being none more truly your oblig'd Servant, than, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

<P>WHEN these Letters were first print∣ed, I wond'red how <HI>Curll</HI> cou'd come by 'em, and cou'd not but laugh at the pompous title; since whatever you wrote to me was humour, and familiar Raillery. As soon as I came from <HI>Epsom,</HI> I heard you had been to see me, and I writ you a short letter from <HI>Will</HI>'s, that I long'd to see you. Mr <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s,</HI> about that time, charg'd me, with giving 'em to a Mistress, which I positively denied; not in the least, at that time, thinking of it: but some time after, finding in the news-papers Letters from Lady <HI>Packington,</HI> Lady <HI>Chud∣leigh,</HI> and Mr <HI>Norris,</HI> to the same <HI>Sapho</HI> or <HI>E. T.</HI> I began to fear that I was guilty. I have never seen these Letters of <HI>Curll</HI>'s, nor wou'd go to his shop about them; I have not seen this <HI>Sapho,</HI> alias <HI>E. T.</HI> these seven years;—her writing, <HI>That I gave her 'em, to do what she wou'd with 'em,</HI> is strain∣ing the point too far: I thought not of it; nor do I think she did then: But severe Necessity, which catches hold of a Twig, has produced all this; which has lain hid, and forgot by me, so many years. <HI>Curll</HI> sent me a Letter last week, desiring a po∣sitive answer about this matter, but find∣ing
<PB REF="13"/>
I wou'd give him none, he went to <HI>E. T.</HI> and writ a Postscript, in her long romantic Letter, to direct my Answer to his house, but they not expecting an An∣swer, sent a young man to me, whose name, it seems, is <HI>Pattisson:</HI> I told him, I shou'd not write any thing, but I believ'd it might be so, as she writ in her Letter. I am extremely concern'd, that my former Indiscretion in putting 'em into the hands of this <HI>Pretieuse,</HI> shou'd have given you so much disturbance; for the last thing I shou'd do wou'd be to disoblige you; for whom I have ever preserv'd the greatest esteem, and shall ever be, <HI>Sir,</HI></P>

<P>THO' I writ my long Narrative from <HI>Epsom</HI> 'till I was tir'd, yet was I not satisfied; lest any doubt shou'd rest upon your mind. I cou'd not make protestations of my Innocence of a grievous crime; but I was impatient 'till I came to Town, that I might send you those Letters, as a clear evidence, that I was a perfect stranger to
<PB REF="14"/>
all their proceeding: Shou'd I have protested against it, after the printing, it might have been taken for an at∣tempt to decry his purchase; and as the little exception you have taken, has serv'd him to play his game upon us, for these two years; a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more:—The great value she expresses for all you write, and her passion for having 'em, I believe, was what prevail'd upon me to let her keep 'em. By the interval of twelve years at least, from her possession, to the time of printing 'em, 'tis manifest, that I had not the least ground to apprehend such a design: But as People in great straits, bring forth their hoards of old Gold, and most valued Jewels, so <HI>Sapho</HI> had recourse to her hid treasure of Letters, and play'd off, not only your's to me, but all those to herself (as the Lady's last-stake) into the press.—As for me, I hope, when you shall cooly consider the many thousand instances of our being deluded by the females, since that great Original of <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>Eve,</HI> you will have a more favourable thought of the unde∣signing error of.</P>

<P>Now, should our Apology for this Publication be as ill receiv'd, as the Lady's seems to have been by the Gentle∣men concerned; we shall at least have <HI>Her Comfort</HI> of being Thank'd by the rest of the world. Nor has Mr <HI>P.</HI> himself any great cause to think it much Offence to his Modesty, or Reflexion on his Judgment; when we take care to inform the Public, that there are few Let∣ters of his in this Collection which were not written un∣der Twenty years of Age: On the other hand, we doubt not the Reader will be much more surpriz'd to find, at that early period, so much variety of Style, Affecting Sen∣timent, and Justness of Criticism, in pieces which must have been writ in haste, very few perhaps ever re-view'd, and none intended for the Eye of the Public.</P>

<HEAD><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Secretary of State to King <HI>William</HI> the Third.</NOTE> Sir WILLIAM TRUMBULL to Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa∣vour of yours of the 8th instant; and will make you a true excuse, (tho' per∣haps no very good one) that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter, when I sent back your Papers, in hopes of seeing you at <HI>Binfield</HI> before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I should freely now (as I have done too pre∣sumptuously in conversation with you) tell
<PB N="2" REF="17" MS="y"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance with your desires, than that I could think it reasonable. For I am not yet satisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry, who never have been practis'd in the Art. There may possibly be some hap∣py genius's, who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture: But this, tho' it may sometimes be in the right, must be subject to many mistakes, and is certainly but a superficial knowledge; with∣out entring into the art, the methods, and the particular excellencies of the whole composure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Besides my want of skill, I have another reason why I ought to suspect my self, by reason of the great affection I have for you, which might give too much biass, to be kind to every thing that comes from you; but after all, I must say (and I do it with an old-fashion'd sincerity.) that I en∣tirely approve of your Translation of those Pieces of <HI>Homer,</HI> both as to the versifica∣tion and the true sense that shines thro' the whole; nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion, that you
<PB N="3" REF="18"/>
wou'd proceed in translating that incompa∣rable Poet, to make him speak good <HI>En∣glish,</HI> to dress his admirable characters in your proper, significant, and expressive con∣ceptions, and to make his works as useful and instructive to this degenerate age, as he was to our friend <HI>Horace,</HI> when he read him at <HI>Praeneste, Qui, quid sit pul∣chrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c. I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which I confess I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I intreat you to send this presently to be added to the Mis∣cellanies, and I hope it will come time enough for that purpose.</P>
<P>I have nothing to say of my Nephew <HI>B</HI>'s observations, for he sent them to me so late, that I had not time to consider them; I dare say he endeavour'd very faithfully (tho' he told me very hastily) to execute your commands.</P>
<P>All I can add is, that if your excess of mo∣desty shou'd hinder you from publishing this <HI>Essay,</HI> I shall only be sorry that I have no more credit with you, to persuade you to oblige the publick, and very particularly, dear Sir,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>June 15, 1711.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you <HI>Dennis</HI>'s remarks on the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Criticism.</NOTE><HI>Es∣say,</HI> which equally abound in just Cri∣ticisms and fine Railleries: The few obser∣vations in my hand in the margins, are what a morning's leisure permitted me to make, purely for your perusal. For I am of opinion, that such a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book, is but one way to be properly an∣swer'd, and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time persecuted by For∣tune. This I knew not before; if I had, his name had been spar'd in the <HI>Essay,</HI> for that only reason. I can't conceive what ground he has for so excessive a re∣sentment; nor imagine how those <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>But <HI>Appius</HI> reddens at each word you speak,</L>
<L>And stares tremendous with a threatning eye,</L>
<L>Like some fierce Tyrant in old Tapestry.</L></Q></NOTE>three lines can be call'd a reflection on his <HI>Per∣son,</HI> which only describe him subject a little to Anger on some occasions. I have heard of combatants so very furious, as to fall
<PB N="5" REF="20"/>
down themselves with that very blow which they design'd to lay heavy on their anta∣gonists. But if Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienc'd writers from scribling, he shou'd frighten us with his Verse not Prose: for I have often known, that when all the precepts in the world would not re∣claim a sinner, some very sad example has done the business.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verse in the <HI>Dunciad, Book</HI> 1.</NOTE> Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with reason, and I will alter 'em in case of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury, and so serve instead of a friend. What he observes at the bottom of page 20th of his reflections, was objected to by yourself, and had been mended but for the haste of the press: 'Tis right <HI>Hiber∣nian,</HI> and I confess it what the <HI>English</HI> call a <HI>Bull</HI> in the expression, tho' the sense be manifest enough: Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Bulls are seldom in the expression, they are always in the sense.</P>
<P>I shall certainly never make the least reply to him, not only because you advise me, but because I have ever been of opi∣nion, that if a book can't answer for itself
<PB N="6" REF="21"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no sort of purpose for its author to do it. If I am wrong in any sentiment of that <HI>Essay,</HI> I protest sin∣cerely, I don't desire all the world should be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill consequence) meerly that I my self may be thought right, which is of very little con∣sequence.) I'd be the first to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my self; for (as I take it) when a man owns himself to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wiser than he was. But I have had an advan∣tage by the publishing that book of <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>'s, which otherwise I should never have known: It has been the occasion of ma∣king me friends, and open abetters, of se∣veral gentlemen of known sense and wit; and of proving to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken some notice of by the world in general, or I should never be attack'd thus in par∣ticular. I have read that 'twas a custom among the <HI>Romans,</HI> while a General rode in triumph, to have common soldiers in the streets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him; to put him in mind, that tho' his services were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="22"/>
You will see by this, that whoever sets up for wit in these days, ought to have the constancy of a primitive Christian, and be prepar'd to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it. But sure this is the first time that a Wit was attack'd for his <HI>Religion,</HI> as you'll find I am most zealously in this treatise: and you know, Sir, what alarms I have had from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ensuing Letters.</NOTE>opposite side on this account. Have I not reason to cry out, with the poor fellow in <HI>Virgil,</HI><Q><L>Quid jam misero mihi denique restat?</L>
<L>Cui neque apud <HI>Danaos</HI> usquam locus, &amp; super ipsi</L>
<L><HI>Dardanidae</HI> infensi paenas cum Sanguine pos∣cunt!</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis however my happiness that you, Sir, are impartial,
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI> was alike to <HI>Latian</HI> and to <HI>Phrygian,</HI></L>
<L>For you well know, that Wit's of no Religion.</L></Q></P>
<P>The manner in which Mr. <HI>D.</HI> takes to pieces several particular lines, detach'd from their natural places, may shew how easy it is to a caviller to give a new sense, or
<PB N="8" REF="23"/>
a new nonsense to any thing. And in∣deed his constructions are not more wrest∣ed from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts, as they call'd 'em.</P>
<P>Our friend the <HI>Abbè</HI> is not of that sort, who with the utmost candour and free∣dom, has modestly told me what others thought, and shewn himself one (as he very well expresses it) rather of a <HI>Number</HI> than a <HI>Party.</HI> The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks most sorts of learning flourish'd a∣mong 'em, and I am of opinion that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em: he believes, that in the most na∣tural and obvious sense, that line (<HI>A second deluge Learning over-run</HI>) will be under∣stood of Learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be understood only (as 'tis meant) of polite Learning, Criticism, Poetry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is the only learning concern'd in the sub∣ject of the <HI>Essay.</HI> It is true, that the <HI>Monks</HI> did preserve what learning there was, about <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth's time; but those who succeeded fell into the depth of Barba∣rism, or at least stood at a stay while others rose from thence, insomuch that even <HI>Eras∣mus</HI> and <HI>Reuchlin</HI> could hardly laugh them out of it. I am highly oblig'd to the <HI>Ab∣bè</HI>'s zeal in my commendation, and good∣ness
<PB N="9" REF="24"/>
in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his testifying some esteem for the book, just at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour against it, is an instance of great generosity and candor, which I shall ever acknowledge.</P>

<P>IN your last you inform'd me of the mistaken zeal of some people, who seem to make it no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous, than Do∣ctors do that they are sick; only that they may magnify their own cure, and triumph over an imaginary distemper. The Simile objected to in my <HI>Essay,</HI>
<Q><L>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</L>
<L>To one small Sect, and all are damn'd beside.)</L></Q>
plainly concludes at this second line, where stands a full stop: and what follows (<HI>Mean∣ly they seek,</HI> &amp;c.) speaks only of <HI>Wit,</HI> (which is meant by <HI>that blessing,</HI> and <HI>that sun</HI>) for how can the sun of <HI>faith</HI> be said
<PB N="10" REF="25"/>
to <HI>sublime the southern wits,</HI> and to <HI>ripen the genius's of northern climates?</HI> I fear these gentlemen understand grammar as little as they do criticism; and perhaps out of good nature to the Monks, are willing to take from 'em the censure of ignorance, and to have it to themselves. The word <HI>They</HI> refers (as I am sure I meant, and as I thought every one must have known) to those critics there spoken of, who are par∣tial to some particular sett of writers, to the prejudice of all others. And the very simile it self, if twice read, may convince them, that the censure here of damning, lies not on our Church at all, unless they call our Church <HI>one small Sect:</HI> and the cautious words, (<HI>by each Man</HI>) manifestly show it a general reflection on all such (whoever they are) who entertain those narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi∣nisters and Presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living.</P>
<P>Yet after all, I promise you, Sir, if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith tho' weak understand∣ing, I will (tho' it were from no other principle than that of common good na∣ture) comply with it. And if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies, for it is in a very narrow
<PB N="11" REF="26"/>
compass) that stumbling-block, tho' it be but a little pebble, shall be removed out of their way. If the heat of these good disputants (who, I am afraid, being bred up to wrangle in the schools, cannot get rid of the humor all their lives) shou'd pro∣ceed so far as to personal reflections upon me, I assure you notwithstanding I will do, or say nothing, however provok'd (for some people can no more provoke than oblige) that is unbecoming the character of a true Catholick. I will set before me the example of that great man, and great Saint <HI>Erasmus;</HI> who in the midst of ca∣lumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence, and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christianity. However I wou'd advise them to suffer the mention of <HI>him</HI> to pass unregarded, lest I should be forc'd to do that for his reputation which I wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to vindicate so great a light of our Church from the malice of past times, and the ig∣norance of the present, in a language which may extend farther than that in which the Trifle about Criticism is written. I wish these gentlemen wou'd be contented with finding fault with me only, who will sub∣mit to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on∣ly am concern'd; I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb it
<PB N="12" REF="27"/>
for things of so little consequence as my credit and my sense. A little humility can do a Poet no hurt, and a little Charity wou'd do a Priest none: For as St. <HI>Austin</HI> finely says, <HI>Ubi Charitas, ibi Humilitas; ubi Humilitas, ibi Pax.</HI></P>

<P>THE concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation, by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy <HI>Vandals</HI> have thought fit to pass upon me, makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of letting before you in a clear light the true state of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believ'd the best piece of service one cou'd do to our religion, was openly to express our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and <HI>Piae fraudes,</HI> which it stands so little in need of, and which have laid it under so great a scan∣dal among its enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="28"/>
Nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them, as that too peremptory and seem∣ingly-uncharitable assertion of an utter <HI>Im∣possibility</HI> of <HI>Salvation</HI> to all but ourselves; <HI>invincible</HI> ignorance excepted, which in∣deed some people define under so great li∣mitations, and with such exclusions, that it seems as if that word were rather in∣vented as a salvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl'd about so freely on almost all mankind by the Hands of ecclesiasticks) than as a real exception to almost-universal damnation. For, besides the small number of the truly faithful in our Church, we must again subdivide; the <HI>Jansenist</HI> is damned by the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> by the <HI>Jansenist,</HI> the <HI>Scotist</HI> by the <HI>Thomist,</HI> and so forth.</P>
<P>There may be errors I grant, but I can't think 'em of such consequence as to destroy utterly the charity of mankind; the very greatest bond in which we are engag'd by God to one another. Therefore I own to you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex∣press my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the religion I profess are com∣monly charg'd with; and I hop'd, a slight insinuation, introduc'd so easily by a ca∣sual similitude only, cou'd never have gi∣ven offence; but on the contrary must
<PB N="14" REF="29"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and time, where we are the smaller party, and consequently most misrepresented, and most in need of vindication.</P>
<P>For the same reason, I took occasion to mention the <HI>Superstition</HI> of some ages after the subversion of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> which is too manifest a truth to be deny'd, and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith who are free from it. Our silence in these points may with some reason make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those bigottries; which yet in reality all good and sensible Men despise, tho' they are persuaded not to speak against 'em; I can't tell why, since now 'tis no way the interest even of the worst of our Priesthood (as it might have been then) to have them smother'd in si∣lence: For as the opposite Sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being slander'd; 'tis our business now to show it is slander'd unjustly, and to vindicate ourselves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with.

As to particulars: you cannot but have observ'd that at first the whole objection against the simile of wit and faith lay to the word <HI>They:</HI> When that was beyond contradiction removed (the very Grammar serving to confute 'em) then the objection lies against the <HI>Simile itself;</HI> or if that si∣mile will not be objected to (sense and common reason being indeed a little stub∣born, and not apt to give way to every body) next the mention of <HI>Superstition</HI> must become a crime (as if <HI>Religion</HI> and she were sisters, or that it were a scandal upon the family of <HI>Christ,</HI> to say a word against the Devil's bastard.) Afterwards, more mischief is discover'd in a place that seem'd innocent at first, the two lines about <HI>Schis∣matics,</HI> at the bottom of page 24. An or∣dinary man wou'd imagine the author plainly declar'd against those schismatics, for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the understanding of some few of its believers: But these believers are call'd <HI>Dull,</HI> and because I say that <HI>those Schis∣matics</HI> think <HI>some</HI> believers <HI>dull,</HI> therefore these charitable interpreters of my mean∣ing will have it, that <HI>I</HI> think <HI>all</HI> believers dull. I was telling lately Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> these objections: who assured me I had said no∣thing which a Catholick need to disown,
<PB N="16" REF="31"/>
and I have cause to know that gentle∣man's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head, which I confess I can't but perfectly acquiesce in; that when a sett of people are piqu'd at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage, their method of re∣venge on the truth-speaker is to attack his reputation a By-way, and not openly to object to the place they are really gall'd by: What these therefore (in his opinion) are in earnest angry at, is, that <HI>Erasmus</HI> whom their tribe oppress'd and persecuted shou'd be vindicated after an age of ob∣loquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an honest truth in behalf of the dead, whom no man sure will flatter, and to whom few will do justice. Others, you know, were as angry that I mention'd Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> with honour; who as he never refused to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him, so honestly deserv'd it from all others, tho' of ever so diffe∣rent interests or sentiments. May I be ever guilty of this sort of liberty, and la∣titude of principle! which gives us the hardiness of speaking well of those whom envy oppresses ev'n after death. As I wou'd always speak well of my living friends when they are absent, nay because
<PB N="17" REF="32"/>
they are absent; so would I much more of the dead, in that eternal absence; and the rather because I expect no thanks for it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see I do in my conscience persist in what I have written; yet in my friendship I will recant and alter what∣ever you please, in case of a second edi∣tion (which I think the book will not so soon arrive at, for <HI>Tonsons</HI>'s printer told me he drew off a thousand copies in this first impression, and I fancy a treatise of this nature, which not one gentleman in three∣score even of a liberal education can under∣stand, can hardly exceed the vent of that number.)

<P>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter, by which I find you shift the seene of your life from the town to the country, and enjoy that mix'd state which wise men both delight in, and are quali∣fy'd for. Methinks the Moralists and Phi∣losophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending intirely either solitude, or publick life. In the former, men for the most part grow useless by too much rest, and in the latter are destroy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying still, putrify and are good for nothing, and
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others, and are swallow'd up and lost the sooner themselves. Those indeed who can be useful to all states, should be like gentle streams, that not only glide thro' lonely valleys and forests amidst the flocks and the shepherds, but visit populous towns in their course, and are at once of ornament and service to them. But there are another sort of people who seem design'd for soli∣tude, such I mean as have more to hide than to show: As for my own part, I am one of those of whom <HI>Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Tam umbratiles sunt, ut putent in turbido esse quic∣quid in luce est.</HI> Some men like some pic∣tures, are fitter for a corner than a full light; and I believe such as have a natural bent to solitude (to carry on the former similitude) are like waters which may be forc'd into fountains and exalted into a great height, may make a noble figure and a louder noise, but after all they would run more smoothly, quietly and plentiful∣ly, in their own natural course upon the ground. The consideration of this would <NOTE PLACE="foot">These foregoing Similitudes our Author had put into Verse some years before, and inserted into Mr. <HI>Wycherleys</HI>'s Poem on <HI>Mixt Life.</HI> We find him apparently in the Versification of them, as they are since printed in <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s eosthumous Works, 8o <HI>Page</HI> 3<HI>d and</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI></NOTE>

make me very well contented with the possession only of that Quiet which <HI>Cowley</HI> calls the <HI>Companion of obscurity.</HI> But who∣ever has the Muses too for his companions, can never be idle enough to be uneasy. Thus Sir, you see I would flatter myself into a good opinion of my own way of living. <HI>Plutarch</HI> just now told me, that 'tis in hu∣man life as in a game at tables, where a man may wish for the highest cast, but if his chance be otherwise, he is even to play it as well as he can, and to make the best of it.

<P>YOU formerly observ'd to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the disparity we often find in him sick and well: Thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the weak∣ness of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to consider myself in these diffe∣rent views, and I hope have receiv'd some
<PB N="28" REF="43"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> says be true, that
<Q><L>The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>
<L>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then surely sickness, contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body, may discover the inward structure more plainly. Sickness is a sort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state, and inspires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thousand volumes of philosophers and divines. It gives so warning a con∣cussion to those props of our vanity, our strength and youth, that we think of for∣tifying ourselves within, when there is so little dependance upon our out-works. Youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age: 'Tis like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank, and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight, but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me, it has afforded several Prospects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the
<PB N="29" REF="44"/>
world have nor dazzled me very much; and I begin where most people end, with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition, and the unsatisfactory nature of all human pleasures. When a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honest <HI>Hibernian,</HI> who being in bed in the great storm some years ago, and told the house would tumble over his head, made answer, What care I for the house? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the best time to die when one is in the best hu∣mour, and so excessively weak as I now am I may say with conscience, that I am not at all uneasy at the thought that ma∣ny men whom I never had any esteem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an inconsiderable little atome every single man is, with respect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a shame to be concern'd at the removal of such a trivial animal as I am. The morning af∣ter my Exit, the sun will rise as bright as ever, the flowers smell as sweet, the plants spring as green, the world will proceed in its old course, people will laugh as hear∣tily, and marry as fast as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is ele∣gantly express'd in the wisdom of <HI>Solomon</HI>)
<PB N="30" REF="45"/>
passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day. There are rea∣sons enough, in the fourth chapter of the same book, to make any young man con∣tented with the prospect of death. <HI>For ho∣nourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, or is measured by number of years.

The revisal of these let∣ters has been a kind of examination of conscience to me; so fairly and faithfully have I set down in 'em from time to time the true and undistinguish'd state of my mind. But I find that these, which were intended as sketches of my friendship, give as imperfect images of it, as the little landscapes we commonly see in black and white, do of a beautiful country; they can represent but a very small part of it, and that depriv'd of the life and lustre of nature. I perceive that the more I en∣deavour'd
<PB N="38" REF="53"/>
to render manifest the real affe∣ction and value I ever had for you, I did but injure it by representing less and less of it: as glasses which are design'd to make an object very clear, generally contract it. Yet as when people have a full idea of a thing, first, upon their own knowledge, the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance, and are not dis∣pleasing on that score: So I hope the fore∣knowledge you had of my esteem for you, is the reason that you do not dislike my letters.</P>
<P>They will not be of any great service (I find) in the design I mentioned to you: I believe I had better steal from a richer man, and plunder your letters, (which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents, since they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour.) You have some cause to apprehend this usage from me, if what some say be true, that I am a great Borrower; however I have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challeng'd me for it: and those who say it are such, whose writings no man ever borrow'd from, so have the least reason to complain: Their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own.—Another has been pleased to declare, that my Verses are corrected by

<P>THough any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me, yet I must own your last letter made me uneasy: You real∣ly use a style of compliment, which I ex∣pect as little as I deserve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth of a young Lady. From the moment one sets up for an author, one must be treated as ceremoniously, that it is, as unfaithfully,
<Q><L>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</L></Q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va∣nity which first makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a cox∣comb for life. But I must grant it is but a just judgment upon Poets, that they whose chief pretence is Wit, shou'd be treated just as they themselves treat Fools, that is, be cajol'd with praises. And I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="57"/>
I would not be thought to say this, as if the obliging letter you sent me deserv'd this imputation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what <HI>Caesar</HI> said of his Wife. <HI>It was not sufficient that he knew her to be chast, himself, but she shou'd not be so much as suspected by others.</HI></P>
<P>As to the wonderful discoveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of myself; I treat it as you who are in the Secret treat common news, groundless reports of things at a distance, which I who look into the true springs of the affair at home, in my own breast, know to have no foundation at all. For <HI>Fame</HI> tho' it be as <HI>Milton</HI> finely calls it, <HI>The last Infirmity of noble Minds,</HI> is scarce so strong a temp∣tation as to warrant our loss of time here: It can never make us lie down contentedly on a death-bed (as some of the ancients are said to have done with that thought.) You, Sir, have yourself taught me, that an easy situation at that hour, can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by the strongest endeavours of the Wit, but may be gain'd by the sincere intentions of the Heart only. As in the next world, so in this, the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind, not the ex∣tent
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
of the capacity: Friendship here is an emanation from the same source as Beati∣tude there: the same benevolence and grate∣ful disposition that qualifies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other. The utmost point of my de∣sires in my present state terminates in the society and good-will of worthy men, which I look upon as no ill earnest and fore-taste of the society and alliance of happy souls hereafter.</P>
<P>The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy; but causes me to set some value upon myself as a part of your care. The instances I daily meet with of these agreeable awake∣nings of friendship, are of too pleasing a nature not to be acknowledged whenever I think of you. I am,</P>

As to poeti∣cal affairs, I am content at present to be a bare looker-on, and from a practitioner turn an admirer, which is (as the world goes) not very usual. <HI>Cato</HI> was not so much the wonder of <HI>Rome</HI> in his days, as he is of <HI>Britain</HI> in ours; and tho' all the foolish industry possible has been used to make it thought a Party-play, yet what the au∣thor once said of another may the most properly in the world be apply'd to him, on this occasion.:
<Q><L>Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,</L>
<L>And Factions strive, who shall applaud him most.</L></Q></P>
<P>The numerous and violent claps of the Whig-party on the one side of the theatre, were echo'd back by the Tories on the other; while the Author sweated behind the scenes with concern, to find their applause proceeding more from the hand than the head. This was the case too of the Prologue-writer, who was clapp'd into a stanch Whig, at almost ev'ry two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applauses of the opposite Faction, my Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> sent for <HI>Booth</HI> who play'd <HI>Cato,</HI> into the box,

<P>YOUR last is the more obliging, as it hints at some little niceties in my con∣duct, which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me, and which (so trivial as things of this nature seem) are yet of no slight consequence, to people whom every body talks of, and every body as he pleases. 'Tis a sort of Tax that attends an estate in <HI>Parnassus,</HI> which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small possession an author holds. For indeed an author who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thanked for the plea∣sure, and sometimes ill-treated by those very persons that first debauch'd him. Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way displeas'd that I have offended the violent of all Parties already; and at the same time I assure you conscientiously, I feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me, or are dissatisfied with me. This frame of mind is so easy, that I am perfectly content with my condition.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="66"/>
As I hope and would flatter myself, that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either, so 'tis a pleasure to me that you guess'd so right in regard to the Author of that <HI>Guardian</HI> you mentioned. But I am sorry to find it has taken air that I have some hand in those Papers, because I write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people, nor the disrepute of it with others. An honest <HI>Jacobite</HI> spoke to me the sense or non∣sense of the weak part of his Party ve∣ry fairly, that the good people took it ill of me, that I writ with <HI>Steele,</HI> tho' upon never so indifferent subjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I do: yet I doubt not but many little ca∣lumniators and persons of sower disposi∣tions will take occasion hence to bespatter me. I confess I scorn narrow souls, of all parties, and if I renounce my reason in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pass that the few <HI>Guardians</HI> I have written are so generally known for mine: that in par∣ticular which you mention I never disco∣vered to any man but the publisher, till ve∣ry lately: yet almost every body I met told me of it.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="67"/>
The true reason that Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> laid down the Paper, was a quarrel between him and <HI>Jacob Tonson.</HI> He stood engaged to his bookseller, in articles of penalty, for all the <HI>Guardians;</HI> and by desisting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the <HI>Englishman,</HI> was quit of his obliga∣tion: these papers being printed by <HI>Buck∣ley.</HI></P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I cannot any way enter into that secret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the rest of his politicks. Tho' 'tis said, he will take into these papers also several sub∣jects of the politick kind, as before: But I assure you as to myself, I have quite done with 'em, for the future. The little I have done, and the great respect I bear Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> as a Man of Wit, has rendered me a suspected Whig to some of the Violent, but (as old <HI>Dryden</HI> said before me) 'Tis not the Violent I design to please.</P>
<P>I generally employ the mornings in paint∣ing with Mr. <HI>Jervas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epistle to him in Verse, writ about this time.</NOTE>; and the evenings in the conversation of such, as I think can most improve my mind, of whatever Party or Denomination they are.

The best way I know of overco∣ming Calumny and Misconstruction, is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right, and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it.

But I am at length convinc'd that my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort; so I must e'en be contented with telling you the old story, that I love you heartily. I have often found by experience, that na∣ture

and truth, tho' never so low or vul∣gar, are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented; it would be divert∣ing to me, to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent in∣consistencies and tautologies just as it thought 'em.

<P>You can't wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent, when I tell you how they are distracted.

Sickness and Pain is the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear the portion of the other! What a bustle we make about passing our time, when all our space is but a point? What aims and am∣bitions are crowded into this little instant of our life, which (as <HI>Shakespear</HI> finely words it) is <HI>Rounded with a Sleep?</HI> Our whole extent of Being no more, in the eyes of him who gave it, than a scarce perceptible moment of duration. Those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the Naturalists assure us, are yet as long-lived and possess as wide a scene of action as man, if we consider him with an eye to all Space, and all Eternity. Who knows what plots, what atchievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust, within his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e of some minutes? and of how much less

and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com∣fortable prospect to be reflecting, that so long a siege as that of <HI>Troy</HI> lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progress. Indeed the <HI>Greek</HI> fortification upon a nearer ap∣proach does not appear so formidable as it did, and I am almost apt to flotter myself, that <HI>Homer</HI> secretly seems inclined to a cor∣respondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are indeed, a sort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, called Commentators and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo∣ple by their number and bulk, and perplex our progress under pretence of fortifying their author. These lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have digged, encompassed with dirt of their own heaping up, but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by mining under ground, that is, by using the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly∣ing over their heads.</P>
<P>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find you are concern'd how I shall be paid, and are sollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many discarded Generals, to be first envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and lastly neglected. The former (the
<PB N="58" REF="73"/>
constant attendant upon all great and lau∣dable enterprizes) I have already experi∣enc'd. Some have said I am not a Master in the <HI>Greek,</HI> who either are so themselves or are not: If they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without having catechized me. But if they can read (for I know some Critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying be∣fore them, some specimens of my tran∣slation from this Author in the <HI>Miscel∣lanies,</HI> which they are heartily welcome to. I have met with as much malignity another way, some calling me a Tory, because the heads of that party have been distinguishingly favourable to me; some a Whig, because I have been favoured with yours, Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Craggs</HI> his friendship, and of late with my Lord <HI>Hal∣lifax</HI>'s Patronage. How much more natu∣ral a conclusion might be formed, by any good-natur'd man, that a person who has been well used by all sides, has been offen∣sive to none. This miserable age is so sunk between animosities of Party and those of Religion, that I begin to fear, most men have politicks enough to make (thro' vio∣lence) the best Scheme of Government a bad one; and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation. I hope for my own part, never to have more of either than is con∣sistent

with common justice and charity, and always as much as becomes a christian and honest man. Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a <HI>Papist</HI> here, where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much, and to the fifth part as being so too little; I shall yet be easy under both their mistakes, and be what I more than seem to be, for I suffer for it.

<P>THE Question you ask in relation to Mr. <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> and <HI>Philips,</HI> I shall an∣swer in a few words. Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> did ex∣press himself with much indignation against me one evening at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-house (as I was told) saying, That I was entered into a Cabal with Dean <HI>Swift</HI> and others to write against the <HI>Whig-Interest,</HI> and in par∣ticular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Addison.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> never open'd his lips to my face, on this or any like occasion, tho' I was almost every night in the same room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> came to me a night or two af∣ter <HI>Philips</HI> had talk'd in this idle manner, and assur'd me of his disbelief of what had been said, of the friendship we shou'd always maintain, and desir'd I wou'd say nothing further of it. My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> did me the honour to stir in this matter, by speaking to several people to obviate a false aspersion, which might have done me no small preju∣dice with one Party. However <HI>Philips</HI> did all
<PB N="63" REF="78"/>
he could, secretly to continue the report with the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club, and kept in his hands the Subscriptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have since given him to understand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with a man whom I think a scoundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for this money, but commissioned one of the <HI>Players,</HI> his equals, to receive it. This is the whole matter; but as to the secret grounds of <HI>Philips</HI>'s malignity, they will make a very pleasant History when we meet. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> and some others have been much diverted with it, and most of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their Secretary. It is to this management of <HI>Philips,</HI> that the world owes Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Pastorals.</HI> The ingenious Author is extream∣ly your servant, and would have comply'd with your kind invitation, but that he is just now appointed Secretary to my Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> in his Embassy to <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>
<P>I am sensible of the zeal and friendship with which I am sure you will always defend your friend in his absence, from all those little tales and calumnies, which a Man of any genius or merit is born to. I shall never complain while I am happy in such noble defenders, and in such con∣temptible

<P>YOU mention the account I gave you some time ago of the things which <HI>Philips</HI> said in his foolishness; but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter, whe∣ther you receiv'd a long one from me a∣bout a fortnight since. It was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence. I there launched into some account of my tem∣poral affairs, and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual. The conclu∣sion of your Letter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you <HI>pray'd</HI> for me: Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of most other Friends, who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done
<PB N="65" REF="80"/>
him a service, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences, which I assure you I am daily more and more convine'd of; and indeed I have for some years past, look'd upon all of 'em no better than amusements. To make them the ultimate end of our pursuit, is a miserable and short ambition, which will drop from us at ev'ry little dis∣appointments here, and even in case of no disappointmentr here, will infallibly desert us hereafter. The utmost fame they are capable of bestowing, is never worth the pains they cost us, and the time they lose us. If you attain the top of your desires that way, all those who envy you will do you harm; and of those who admire you, few will do you good. The unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies, and pro∣bably the successful your secret ones: For those hate not more to be excelled, than these to be rivalled. And at the upshot, after a life of perpetual application, to re∣flect that you have been doing nothing for yourself, and that the same or less In∣dustry might have gain'd you a Friendship that can never deceive or end, a satisfaction which praise cannot bestow, nor vanity feel, and a glory which (tho' in one respect like same, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<PB N="66" REF="81"/>
shall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. These, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my sentiments, whenever I think at all; for half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination: Our schemes of government, our systems of phi∣losophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but so many shadowy images, and airy pros∣pects, which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent, as we are more o'ercast with the darkness, and disturb'd with the fumes of human vanity.</P>
<P>The same thing that makes old men wil∣ling to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long habit, and weariness of the same track. <HI>Homer</HI> will work a cure upon me; fifteen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years, to make one old in Rhime: And I shou'd be sorry and ashamed, to go on jingling to the last step, like a waggoner's horse, in the same road, and so leave my <HI>Bells</HI> to the next silly ani∣mal that will be proud of 'em. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason, who is measuring syllables and coupling rhimes, when he should be mending his own Soul, and securing his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I should be unwor∣thy even of those small and limited parts

<P>I Have no better excuse to offer you, that I have omitted a task naturally so plea∣sing to me as conversing upon paper with you; but that my time and eyes have been wholly employ'd upon <HI>Homer,</HI> whom I al∣most fear I shall find but one way of imita∣ting, which is, in his blindness. I am per∣petually afflicted with headach's, that very much affect my sight; and indeed since my coming hither I have scarce passed an hour agreeably, except that in which I read your letter. I would seriously have you think, you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendship, than he who least deserves it on all other ac∣counts than his due sense of it. But let me tell you, you can hardly guess what a task you undertake, when you profess your self my friend; there are some <HI>Tories</HI> who will take you for a <HI>Whig,</HI> some <HI>Whigs</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="83"/>
who will take you for a <HI>Tory,</HI> some <HI>Pro∣testants</HI> who will esteem you a rank <HI>Papist,</HI> and some <HI>Papists</HI> who will account you a <HI>Heretick.</HI></P>
<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men. The notions of right and wrong are so far strain'd, that perhaps to be in the right so very violently, may be of worse consequence than to be easily and quietly in the wrong. I really wish all men so well, that I am satisfied but few can wish me so; but if those few are such as tell me they do, I am content, for they are the best people I know: While you believe me what I profess as to Religion, I can bear any thing the Bigotted may say; while Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> likes my poetry, I can endure <HI>Dennis</HI> and a thousand more like him; while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can easily support it, tho' the most violent and mad of all parties rose up to throw dirt at me.</P>
<P>I must expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my <HI>Homer.</HI> Whoever in our times would be a professor of learning above his fellows, ought at the very first to enter the world with the constancy and re∣solution of a primitive Christian, and be prepared to suffer all sorts of publick Perse∣cution.
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but endeavour to distin∣guish himself, or gratify others by his studies, he is immediately treated as a common ene∣my, instead of being look'd upon as a com∣mon friend; and assaulted as generally, as if his whole design were to prejudice the State, and ruin the publick. I will venture to say, no man ever rose to any degree of perfe∣ction in writing, but thro' obstinacy and an inveterate resolution against the stream of mankind: So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned, it was in its own despite. For when first they essay their parts, all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then some particular persons who were be∣fore unfortunate in their own attempts, are sworn foes to them, only because they suc∣ceed.—Upon the whole, one may say of the best writers, that they pay a severe fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please.</P>

<P>I Am just enter'd upon the old way of life again, sleep and musing. It is my employment to revive the old of past ages to the present, as it is yours to transmit the young of the present, to the future. I am copying the great Master in one art, with the same love and diligence with which the Painter hereafter will copy you in another.</P>
<P>Thus I should begin my Epistle to you, if it were a <HI>Dedicatory</HI> one. But as it is a friendly letter, you are to find nothing mentioned in your own praise but what only one in the world is witness to, your particular good-natur'd offices to me. What∣ever mankind in general would allow you, that I am not to give you to your face; and if I were to do it in your absence, the world would tell me I am too partial to be permit∣ted to pass any judgment of you.</P>
<P>So you see me cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments, or common discourse. The first you wou'd take ill, tho' I told you but half what I ought; so in short the last only remains.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="86"/>
And as for the last, what can you expect from a man who has not talk'd these five days? who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can, from all the present world, its customs and its manners, to be fully pos∣sest and absorpt in the past? When people talk of going to Church, I think of Sacri∣fices and Libations; when I see the parson, I address him as <HI>Chryses</HI> priest of <HI>Apollo;</HI> and instead of the Lord's Prayer, I begin

While you in the world are concerned about the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession, I consider only how <HI>Menelaus</HI> may recover <HI>Helen,</HI> and the <HI>Trojan</HI> war be put to a speedy conclusion. I never inquire if the Queen be well or not, but heartily wish to be at <HI>Hector</HI>'s fu∣neral.

<P>I Thank you for your good offices which are numberless. <HI>Homer</HI> advances so fast, that he begins to look about for the orna∣ments he is to appear in, like a modish mo∣dern author,—

<P>I have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of Poetry; for it takes me up so intirely, that I scarce see what passes under my nose, and hear nothing that is said about me. To fol∣low Poetry as one ought, one must forget father and mother, and cleave to it alone. My <HI>Rêverie</HI> has been so deep, that I have scarce had an interval to think myself un∣easy in the want of your company. I now and then just miss you as I step into bed; this minute indeed I want extremely to see you, the next I shall dream of nothing but the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> or the recovery of <HI>Briseis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="88"/>
I fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours, because I am pretty sure there never was a friendship of so easy a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Va∣nity we have, expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Artist you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope (piously hope) to hear these things. At home we follow our business, when we have any; and think and talk most of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friendship of a stay'd man and his wife, who are seldom so fond as to hin∣der the business of the house from going on all day, or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the last, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantick friend∣ships, like violent loves, begin with dis∣quiets, proceed to jealousies, and conclude in animosities. I have liv'd to see the fierce advancement, the sudden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of these enormous friendships, and am perfectly con∣vinced of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in, That nothing hinders the con∣stant agreement of people who live toge∣ther,
<PB N="74" REF="89"/>
but meer vanity; a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity or merit, and an inward expectation of such an Over-measure of deference and regard, as answers to their own extravagant false scale; and which no body can pay, because none but themselves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts.</P>

<P>WHatever studies on the one hand, or amusements on the other, it shall be my fortune to fall into, I shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of 'em. The Task I undertook<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Translation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE>, tho' of weight enough in itself, has had a voluntary in∣crease, by the inlarging my design of the <HI>Notes;</HI> and the necessity of consulting a number of books has carry'd me to <HI>Ox∣ford:</HI> But I fear, thro' my Lord <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s and Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s means, I shall be more con∣versant with the pleasures and company of
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
the place, than with the Books and Manu∣scripts of it.</P>
<P>I find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of <HI>old Greece,</HI> since I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the publick libraries here. But with all the care I am capable of, I have some cause to fear the Engraver will prejudice me in a few situa∣tions. I have been forced to write to him in so high a style, that were my epistle in∣tercepted, it would raise no small admira∣tion in an ordinary man. There is scarce an order in it of less importance, than to remove such and such mountains, alter the course of such and such rivers, place a large city on such a coast, and raze another in another country. I have set bounds to the sea, and said to the land, <HI>thus far shalt thou advance,</HI> and <HI>no further</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This relates to the Map of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> laid down by our Author in his observations on the second <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE>. In the mean time, I who talk and command at this rate, am in danger of loosing my horse, and stand in some fear of a country justice. To dis∣arm me indeed, may be but prudential, con∣sidering what armies I have at present on foot, and in my service: A hundred thou∣sand <HI>Grecians</HI> are no contemptible body; for all that I can tell, they may be as for∣midable
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
as four thousand <HI>Priests;</HI> and they seem proper forces to send against those in <HI>Barcelona.</HI> That siege deserves as fine a poem as the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the machining part of poetry would be the juster in it, as they say the inhabitants expect Angels from hea∣ven to their assistance. May I venture to say, who am a <HI>Papist,</HI> and to say to you who are a <HI>Papist,</HI> that nothing is more a∣stonishing to me, than that people so greatly warm'd with a sense of Liberty, should be capable of harbouring such weak Supersti∣tion, and that so much bravery and so much folly can inhabit the same breasts?</P>
<P>I could not but take a trip to <HI>London,</HI> on the death of the <HI>Queen,</HI> mov'd by the com∣mon curiosity of mankind, who leave their own business to be looking upon other mens. I thank God, that as for myself, I am be∣low all the accidents of State-changes by my circumstances, and above them by my phi∣losophy. Common charity of man to man, and universal good will to all, are the points I have most at heart; and I am sure those are not to be broken for the sake of any go∣vernors, or government. I am willing to hope the best, and what I more wish than my own or any particular man's advance∣ment, is, that this turn may put an end entirely to the divisions of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory;</HI> that the parties may love each other as
<PB N="77" REF="92"/>
well as I love them both; or at least hurt each other as little as I would either; and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs; that is to say, that want of <HI>power</HI> itself in us may not be a surer prevention of harm, than want of <HI>will</HI> in them. I am sure, if all <HI>Whigs</HI> and all <HI>Tories</HI> had the spirit of one <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> that I know, it would be well for all <HI>Roman-Catholicks;</HI> and if all <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> had always had that spirit, it had been well for all others, and we had never been charged with so wicked a spirit as that of Persecution.</P>
<P>I agree with you in my sentiment of the state of our nation since this change: I find myself just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own, heartily wishing the good, that is the quiet of my country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by party-spirit, which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few.</P>

You know I cou'd keep you in suspense for twenty lines, but I will tell you directly that Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> and I have had a conversation, that it would have been worth your while to have been plac'd behind the wainscot, or behind some half-length Picture to have heard. He assur'd me that he wou'd make use not only of his interest, but of his art, to do you some service; he did not mean his Art of Poetry, but his Art at Court; and he is sensible that nothing can have a better air for himself, than moving in your favour, especially since in∣sinuations were spread that he did not care you should prosper too much as a Poet. He protests that it shall not be his fault, if there is not the best intelligence in the world, and the most hearty friendship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He owns, he was afraid Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> might have carry'd you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animosity, but now

all is safe, and you are escap'd even in his opinion. I promis'd in your name, like a good Godfather, not that you should re∣nounce the devil and all his works, but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake; therefore prepare yourself for some civilities.</P>

<P>I admire your <HI>Whig-principles</HI> of Resist∣ance exceedingly, in the spirit of the <HI>Bar∣celonians.</HI> I join in your wish for them.

or envying another's reputation as a Poet. So I leave it to Time to convince him as to bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, to shew him the shallow depths of those half-witted creatures who mis-inform'd him, and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to imitate, and therefore asham'd to flatter.

<P>I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for you can deserve. May I hope that some late male∣volencies have lost their effect? Indeed it is neither for me, nor my enemies, to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not; but if you would judge by probabilities, I beg to know which of your poetical acquain∣tance has so little Interest in pretending to be so? Methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who desires no real service: I am only to get as much from the <HI>Whigs,</HI> as I got by the <HI>Tories,</HI> that is to say, Civility; being neither so proud as to be in∣sensible of any good office, nor so humble, as

not to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice.</P>
<P>I will not value myself upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you; for (to say the truth) all the world speaks well of you, and I should be under a necessity of doing the same, whether I cared for you or not.</P>
<P>As to what you have said of me, I shall never believe that the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> can speak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you sincere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two first books of my translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> which are now in the hands of my Lord <HI>Halifax.</HI> I am sensible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your good will, when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice, and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts, at the same time that you tell others your most favourable ones.</P>
<P>I have a farther request, which I must press with earnestness. My Bookseller is reprinting the <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> to which you have done too much honour in your <HI>Spectator</HI> of N<SUP>o</SUP>. 253. The period in that paper, where you say, <Q REND="inline">"I have admitted some strokes of ill nature into that <HI>Essay,</HI>"</Q>
<PB N="84" REF="99"/>
is the only one I could wish omitted of all you have written: but I wou'd not desire it should be so, unless I had the merit of re∣moving your objection: I beg you but to point out those strokes to me, and you may be assured they shall be treated without mercy.</P>
<P>Since we are upon proofs of sincerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each other's opinion) give me leave to name another passage in the same <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I wish you would alter It is where you mention an observation upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s Verses of <HI>Sysi∣phus</HI>'s Stone, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These Words are since lest out in Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s Edition, but were extant in all during Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Life.</NOTE><HI>never having been made before by any of the Criticks:</HI> I happen'd to find the same in <HI>Dyonisius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI>'s Treatise, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who treats very largely upon these Verses.

<P>I Am obliged to you both for the favours you have done me, and for those you intend me. I distrust neither your will nor your memory, when it is to do good: and if ever I become troublesome or sollicitous, it must not be out of expectation, but out of gratitude. Your Lordship may either cause me to live agreeably in the town, or contentedly in the country, which is really all the difference I set between an easy fortune and a small one. It is indeed a high strain of generosity in you, to think of making me easy all my life, only be∣cause I have been so happy as to divert you some few hours: But if I may have leave to add, it is because you think me no enemy to my native country, there will appear a better reason; for I must of consequence be very much, (as I sincerely am)</P>

<P>MEthinks when I write to you, I am making a confession, I have got (I can't tell how) such a custom of throwing myself out upon paper without reserve. You were not mistaken in what you judg'd of my temper of mind when I writ last My faults will not be hid from you, and per∣haps it is no dispraise to me that they will not. The cleanness and purity of one's mind is never better prov'd, than in disco∣vering its own faults at first view: as when a Stream shows the dirt at its bottom, it shows also the transparency of the water.</P>
<P>My spleen was not occasioned, how∣ever, by any thing an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dennis,</HI> who writ an abusive Pamphlet this Year, intitled, <HI>Remarks on Mr.</HI> Pope<HI>'s</HI> Homer.</NOTE>abusive, angry Critick could write of me.

and the good that ever lived; that is, to be envy'd and censur'd by bad writers.</P>
<P>You do no more than answer my ex∣pectations of you, in declaring how well you take my freedom in sometimes neg∣lecting, as I do, to reply to your Letters so soon as I ought; those who have a right taste of the substantial part of friendship, can wave the ceremonial. A friend is the only one that will bear the omission; and one may find who is not so, by the very trial of it.</P>
<P>As to any anxiety I have concerning the fate of my <HI>Homer,</HI> the care is over with me. The world must be the judge, and I shall be the first to consent to the justice of its judg∣ment, whatever it be. I am not so arrant an Author, as even to desire, that if I am in the wrong, all mankind should be so.</P>
<P>I am mightily pleas'd with a saying of Monsieur <HI>Tourreil:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"When a Man writes, he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of pleasing all the world: but he is to renounce that desire or hope, the very moment the Book goes out of his hands."</Q></P>

<P>THE Farce of the <HI>What-d'ye-call it,</HI> has occasioned many different speculations in the town. Some look'd upon it as meer jest upon the tragic poets, others as a satire upon the late war. Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> hearing none of the words, and seeing the action to be tragical, was much astonished to find the audience laugh; and says, the Prince and Princess must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account. Several templers, and others of the more vociferous kind of criticks, went with a resolution to hiss, and confest they were forced to laugh so much, that they forgot the design they came with. The Court in general has in a
<PB N="89" REF="105"/>
very particular manner come into the jest, and the three first Nights, (notwithstanding two of them were court-nights) were distin∣guish'd by very full audiences of the first quality. The common people of the pit and gallery receiv'd it at first with great gravity and sedateness, some few with tears; but after the third day they also took the hint, and have ever since been very loud in their claps. There are still some sober men who cannot be of the general opinion, but the laughers are so much the majority, that one or two criticks seem determin'd to undeceive the town at their proper cost, by writing grave dissertations against it: To encourage them in which laudable design, it is resolv'd a <HI>Preface</HI> shall be prefixt to the <HI>Farce,</HI> in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing.</P>
<P>Yesterday Mr. <HI>Steele</HI>'s affair was decided: I am sorry I can be of no other opinion than yours, as to his whole carriage and writings of late. But certainly he has not only been punish'd by others, but suffer'd much even from his own party in the point of character, nor (I believe) receiv'd any amends in that of interest, as yet; whatever may be his Prospects for the future.</P>
<P>This Gentleman, among a thousand others, is a great instance of the fate of all who are carried away by party-spirit, of any side. I wish all violence may succeed

There is a six-penny <HI>Criticism</HI> lately publish'd upon the Tragedy of the <HI>What-d'ye-call-it,</HI> wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead, and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> a knave.

The calamity of your gout is what all your friends, that is to say all that know you, must share in; we desire you in your turn to condole with us, who are under a perse∣cution, and much afflicted with a distemper which proves grievous to many poets, a <HI>Cri∣ticism.</HI> We have indeed some relieving in∣tervals of laughter, (as you know there are in some diseases;) and it is the opinion of divers good guessers, that the last fit will not be more violent than advantageous; for poets assail'd by critics, are like men bitten by <HI>Tarantula's,</HI> they dance on so much the faster.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your Mare could speak, she wou'd give you an account of the extraordinary company she had on the road; which since she cannot do, I will.</P>
<P>It was the enterprizing Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> the redoubtable rival of Mr. <HI>Tonson,</HI> who moun∣ted on a stonehorse, (no disagreeable compa∣nion to your Lordship's mare) overtook me in <HI>Windsor-forest.</HI> He said, he heard I de∣sign'd for <HI>Oxford,</HI> the seat of the muses, and would, as my bookseller, by all means, ac∣company me thither.</P>
<P>I ask'd him where he got his horse? He answered, he got it of his publisher: <Q REND="inline">"For that rogue my printer, (said he) disap∣pointed
<PB N="94" REF="110"/>
me: I hoped to put him in good humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two shillings, with two quarts of wine, be∣sides my conversation. I thought myself cocksure of his horse, which he readily promised me, but said, that Mr. <HI>Tonson</HI> had just such another design of going to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> expecting there the copy of <HI>a Comment upon the Revelations;</HI> and if Mr. <HI>Tonson</HI> went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the said copy."</Q></P>
<P>So in short, I borrow'd this stonehorse of my publisher, which he had of Mr. <HI>Old∣mixon</HI> for a debt; he lent me too the pret∣ty boy you see after me; he was a smutty dog yesterday, and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face: but the De∣vil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his catechise: if you have any more bags, he shall carry them.</P>
<P>I thought Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s civility not to be neglected, so gave the boy a small bagg, containing three shirts and an Elvezir <HI>Vir∣gil;</HI> and mounting in an instant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid Devil behind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> began in this manner. <Q REND="inline">"Now damn them! what if they should put it into the news-paper, how you and I went
<PB N="95" REF="111"/>
together to <HI>Oxford?</HI> why what would I care? If I should go down into <HI>Sussex,</HI> they would say I was gone to the speaker. But what of that? if my son were but big enough to go on with the business, by G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d I would keep as good company as old <HI>Jacob.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon I enquir'd of his son. <Q REND="inline">"The lad (says he) has fine parts, but is some∣what sickly, <HI>much as you are</HI>—I spare for nothing in his education at <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> Pray don't you think <HI>Westminster</HI> to be the best school in <HI>England?</HI> most of the <HI>late Ministry</HI> came out of it, so did many of <HI>this Ministry;</HI> I hope the boy will make his fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Don't you design to let him pass a year at <HI>Oxford?</HI> <Q REND="inline">"To what purpose? (said he) the Universities do but make Pedants, and I intend to breed him a man of Bu∣siness."</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> was talking, I observ'd he sate uneasy on his saddle, for which I express'd some solicitude: Nothing, says he, I can bear it well enough; but since we have the day before us, methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest a while un∣der the Woods. When we were alighted, <Q REND="inline">"See here, what a mighty pretty <HI>Horace</HI> I have in my pocket: what if you amus'd yourself in turning an Ode, till we mount again? Lord! if you pleas'd, what a
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
clever <HI>Miscellany</HI> might you make at lei∣sure hours."</Q> Perhaps I may, said I, if we ride on; the motion is an aid to my fancy; a round trot very much awakens my spirits. Then jog on apace, and I'll think as hard as I can.</P>
<P>Silence ensu'd for a full hour; after which Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> lugg'd the reins, stept short, and broke out, <Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir, how far have you gone?"</Q> I answered seven miles. <Q REND="inline">"Z<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ds, Sir, said <HI>Lintott,</HI> I thought you had done seven stanza's. <HI>Oldsworth</HI> in a ramble round <HI>Wimbleton-hill,</HI> would translate a whole Ode in half this time. I'll say that for <HI>Oldsworth,</HI> (tho' I lost by his <HI>Timothy</HI>'s) he translates an Ode of <HI>Horace</HI> the <HI>quickest</HI> of any man in <HI>England.</HI> I remember Dr. <HI>King</HI> would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could n't speak; and there's Sir <HI>Richard</HI> in that rumbling old Chariot of his, between <HI>Fleet-ditch</HI> and St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s pound shall make you half a <HI>Job.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Pray Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> (said I) now you talk of Translators, what is your method of ma∣naging them? <Q REND="inline">"Sir (reply'd he) those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world: In a hungry fit, they'll swear they under∣stand all the languages in the universe: I have known one of them take down a <HI>Greek</HI> book upon my counter and cry, Ay this is <HI>Hebrew,</HI> I must read it from the
<PB N="97" REF="113"/>
latter end. By G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d I can never be sure in these fellows, for I neither understand <HI>Greek, Latin, French</HI> nor <HI>Italian</HI> myself. But this is my way: I agree with them for ten shillings <HI>per</HI> sheet, with a proviso, that I will have their doings corrected by whom I please; so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author; my judgment giving the negative to all my Translators."</Q> But how are you secure that those correctors may not impose upon you? <Q REND="inline">"Why I get any civil gentleman, (especially any <HI>Scotchman</HI>) that comes into my shop, to read the ori∣ginal to me in <HI>English;</HI> by this I know whether my first Translator be deficient, and whether my Corrector merits his money or no."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you what happened to me last month: I bargain'd with <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> for a new version of <HI>Lucretius</HI> to publish against <HI>Tonson</HI>'s; agreeing to pay the author so many shillings at his producing so many lines. He made a great progress in a very short time, and I gave it to the cor∣rector to compare with the <HI>Latin;</HI> but he went directly to <HI>Creech</HI>'s translation, and found it the same word for word, all but the first page. Now, what d'ye think I did? I arrested the <HI>Translator</HI> for a cheat; nay, and I stopt the <HI>Corrector</HI>'s <HI>pay</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="114"/>
too, upon this proof that he had made use of <HI>Creech</HI> instead of the original."</Q></P>
<P>Pray tell me next how you deal with the Critics. <Q REND="inline">"Sir (said he) nothing more easy. I can silence the most formidable of them; the rich ones for a sheet a piece of the blotted manuscript, which costs me no∣thing. They'll go about with it to their acquaintance, and pretend they had it from the author, who submitted to their correction: this has given some of them such an air, that in time they come to be consulted with, and dedicated too, as the top critics of the town—As for the poor Critics, I'll give you one instance of my management, by which you may guess at the rest. A lean man that look'd like a good scholar, came to me t'other day; he turn'd over <HI>Homer,</HI> shook his head, shrugg'd up his shoulders, and pish'd at every line of it; <HI>One would wonder</HI> (says he) <HI>at the strange presumption of men;</HI> Homer <HI>is no such easy task, that</HI> every <HI>Stripling,</HI> every <HI>Versisier</HI>—he was going on when my Wife called to dinner: Sir, said I, will you please to eat a <HI>piece of beef</HI> with me? Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> said he, <HI>I am sorry you should be at the expence of this great book, I am really concern'd on your ac∣count</HI>—Sir, I am much oblig'd to you: if you can dine upon a piece of beef, toge∣ther with a slice of pudding—<HI>Mr.</HI> Lintott,
<PB N="99" REF="115"/>
<HI>I do not say but Mr.</HI> Pope, <HI>if he would con∣descend to advise with men of learning</HI>—Sir the <HI>pudding</HI> is upon the table, if you please to go in—My critic complies, he comes to a taste of your poetry, and tells me in the same breath, that the <HI>Book</HI> is com∣mendable, and the <HI>Pudding</HI> excellent."</Q></P>
<P>Now Sir (concluded Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>) in re∣turn to the frankness I have shown, pray tell me, <Q REND="inline">"Is it the opinion of your friends at Court, that my Lord <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> will be brought to the Bar or not?"</Q> I told him I heard <HI>not,</HI> and I hoped it, my Lord being one I had particular obligations to. <Q REND="inline">"That may be (reply'd Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>) but by G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d if he is not, I shall lose the printing of a very good Trial."</Q></P>
<P>These my Lord are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of my friend Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> which I have chosen for the subject of a letter. I dropt him as soon as I got to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and paid a visit to my Lord <HI>Carlton</HI> at <HI>Middleton.</HI></P>
<P>The conversations I enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen, and the pleasures from them only to be equal'd when I meet your Lordship. I hope in a few days to cast myself from your horse at your feet.</P>

<P>—I have just set down Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> at the Opera.

<P>—I congratulate you upon Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s first Book. It does not indeed want its merit; but I was strangely disappointed in my expecta∣tion of a Translation nicely true to the ori∣ginal; whereas in those parts where the greatest exactness seems to be demanded, he has been the least careful, I mean the History of <HI>ancient Ceremonies and Rites,</HI> &amp;c. in which you have with great judgment been exact.</P>

<P>I Lay hold of the opportunity given me by my Lord Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> to
<PB N="104" REF="120"/>
assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection I have long borne you, and the memory of so many agreeable conver∣sations as we have passed together. I wish it were a compliment to say such conversa∣tions as are not to be found on this side of the Water: for the spirit of Dissension is gone forth among us nor is it a won∣der that <HI>Button</HI>'s is no longer <HI>Button</HI>'s when <HI>Old England</HI> is no longer <HI>Old England,</HI> that region of hospitality, society, and good hu∣mour. Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politicks as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine sense, refined sense, and exalted sense; but for use and happiness give me a little com∣mon sense. I say this in regard to some gentlemen, professed wits of our acquain∣tance, who fancy they can make Poetry of consequence at this time of day, in the midst of this raging fit of Politicks. For they tell me, the busy part of the nation are not more divided about <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> than these idle fellows of the Feather about Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s and my Translation. I (like the <HI>Tories</HI>) have the town in general, that is the mob, on my side; but 'tis usual with the smaller Party to make up in industry what they want in number, and that's the case with the little Senate of <HI>Cato.</HI> How∣ever, if our principles be well considered, I

must appear a brave <HI>Whig,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI> a rank <HI>Tory;</HI> I translated <HI>Homer</HI> for the pub∣lick in general, he to gratify the inordi∣nate desires of One man only. We have, it seems, a great <HI>Turk</HI> in Poetry, who can ne∣ver bear a Brother on the throne; and has his Mutes too, a sett of Nodders, Winkers, and Whisperers, whose business is to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new Translator of <HI>Homer</HI> is the hum∣blest slave he has, that is to say, his first Minister; let him receive the honours he gives him, but receive them with fear and trembling: let him be proud of the ap∣probation of his absolute Lord; I appeal to the People, as my rightful judges and masters; and if they are not inclined to condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high∣flying proceedings from the small Court∣faction at <HI>Button</HI>'s. But after all I have said of this great Man, there is no rupture be∣tween us: We are each of us so civil and obliging, that neither thinks he is obliged. And I for my part treat with him, as we do with the <HI>Grand Monarch;</HI> who has too many great qualities not to be respected, tho' we know he watches any occasion to oppress us.</P>
<P>When I talk of <HI>Homer,</HI> I must not forget the early present you made me of <HI>Mon∣sieur de la Motte</HI>'s Book. And I can't con∣clude

<P>IT was one of the Enigma's of <HI>Pytha∣goras, When the Winds rise, worship the Echo.</HI> A modern Writer explains this to signify, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>When popular Tumults begin, retire to Solitudes, or such places where Echo's are commonly found; Rocks, Woods,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> I am rather of opinion it should be interpreted, <Q REND="inline">"When Rumours increase, and when there is abundance of Noise and Clamour, be∣lieve the <HI>second Report.</HI>"</Q> This I think agrees more exactly with the <HI>Echo,</HI> and is the more natural application of the Symbol.
<PB N="107" REF="123"/>
However it be, either of these precepts is extreamly proper to be followed at this sea∣son; and I cannot but applaud your reso∣lution of continuing in what you call your Cave in the forest, this winter; and prefer∣ring the noise of breaking Ice to that of breaking Statesmen, the rage of Storms to that of Parties, and fury and ravage of Floods and Tempests to the precipitancy of some, and the ruins of others, which I fear will be our daily prospect in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I sincerely wish myself with you, to con∣template the wonders of God in the firma∣ment, rather than the madness of men on the earth. But I never had so much cause as now to complain of my poetical star, that fixes me at this tumultuous time to attend the gingling of rhymes, and the measuring of syllables: To be almost the only trifler in the nation; and as ridiculous as the Poet in <HI>Petronius,</HI> who while all the rest in the ship were either labouring or praying for life, was scratching his head in a little room, to write a fine description of the tempest.</P>
<P>You tell me you like the sound of no arms but those of <HI>Achilles:</HI> for my part I like them as little as the others. I listed myself in the battles of <HI>Homer,</HI> and I am no sooner in war, but like most other folks, I wish myself out again.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="124"/>
I heartily join with you in wishing Quiet to our native country; Quiet in the state, which like charity in religion, is too much the perfection and happiness of either, to be broken or violated on any pretence or prospect whatsoever: Fire and sword, and fire and faggot are equally my aversion. I can pray for opposite parties, and for op∣posite religions, with great sincerity. I think to be a lover of one's Country is a glorious Elogy, but I do not think it so great an one, as to be a lover of Mankind.</P>

<P>I Should be asham'd of my long idleness, in not acknowledging your kind advice about <HI>Echo,</HI> and your most ingenious ex∣planation of it, relating to Popular tumults; which I own to be very useful: and yet give me leave to tell you, that I keep my∣self to a shorter receipt of the same <HI>Pythago∣ras,</HI> which is <HI>Silence;</HI> and this I shall ob∣serve, if not the whole time of his discipline, yet at least till Your return into this coun∣try.

Sir <HI>William Trumbull</HI> was born at <HI>Easthamsted</HI> in <HI>Berk∣shire:</HI> He was Fellow of <HI>All Souls</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> follow'd the Study of the Civil Law, and was sent by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second Judge-Advocate to <HI>Tangier,</HI> thence Envoy to <HI>Florence, Turin,</HI> &amp;c. and in his way back, Envoy Extraordinary to <HI>France:</HI> from thence, sent by King <HI>James</HI> the Second Ambassador to the <HI>Ottoman Porte.</HI> Afterwards he was made Lord of the Trea∣sury, then Secretary of State with the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> which Office he resign'd in 1697. He retir'd to <HI>Easthamsted,</HI> in <HI>Windsor Forest,</HI> and died in the Place of his Nativity in <HI>December</HI> 1716, aged 77 Bears.

Your Ac∣quaintance on this side the Sea are un∣der terrible Apprehensions, from your long stay in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that you may grow too Polite for them; for we think (since the great success of so damn'd a Play as the Non-Juror) that Politeness is gone over the Water. But others are of opinion it has been longer among you, and was intro∣duced much about the same time with <HI>Frogs,</HI> and with equal Success Poor <HI>Poetry!</HI> the little that's left of it here longs to cross the Seas, and leave <HI>Eusden</HI> in full and peaceable Possession of the <HI>British</HI> Lau∣rel:

And we begin to wish you had the singing of our Poets, as well as the croak∣ing of our Frogs, to yourselves in <HI>Saecula Saeculorum.</HI> It would be well in exchange, if <HI>Parnelle,</HI> and two or three more of your Swans, would come hither, especially that Swan, who like a true modern one, does not sing at all, Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> I am (like the rest of the World) a Sufferer by his Idle∣ness. Indeed I hate that any Man should be idle, while I must translate and comment: And I may the more sincerely wish for good Poetry from others, because I am become a person out of the question; for a Trans∣lator is no more a Poet, than a Taylor is a Man.</P>
<P>You are doubtless persuaded of the Vali∣dity of that famous Verse,
<Q><L>'Tis Expectation makes a Blessing dear.</L></Q>
but why would you make your Friends fon∣der of you than they are? There's no man∣ner of need of it—We begin to expect you no more than <HI>Anti-christ.</HI> A Man that hath absented himself so long from his Friends, ought to be put into the Ga∣zette.</P>

If a wish could transport me to you, and your present Companions, I could do the same. Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> I believe, is a very good Landlord, and a chearful Host at his own Table; I suppose he has perfectly learnt himself, what he has taught so many others, <HI>Rupta non insanire lagena.</HI> Else he would not make a proper Host for your humble Servant, who (you know) tho' he drinks a Glass as seldom as any Man, contrives to break one as often.

<P>But that you and I are upon equal terms of all friendly Laziness, and haven take an inviolable Oath to each other, always to do what we will; I should reproach you for so long a silence. The best amends you can make for saying nothing to me, is by saying

<P>THAT you have not heard from me of late, ascribe not to the usual lazi∣ness of your Correspondent, but to a ram∣ble to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where your name is men∣tioned with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of Doctor <HI>Clarke:</HI> He entertained me with several Drawings, and particularly with the origi∣nal designs of <HI>Inigo Jones</HI>'s <HI>Whitehall.</HI> I there saw and reverenced some of your first Pieces; which future Painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the <HI>Culex</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Batrachom</HI> of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>Having named this latter piece, give me leave to ask what is become of Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and his Frogs? <HI>Oblitusque meorum, oblivis∣cendus &amp; illis,</HI> might be <HI>Horace</HI>'s wish, but will never be mine, while I have such <HI>meo∣rums</HI> as Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> I hope the spring will restore you to us, and with you all the beauties and colours of nature. Not but I congratulate you on the pleasure you must take in being admired in your own Country, which so seldom hap∣pens to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<PB N="117" REF="133"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are Master of an Art that must prosper and grow rich, as long as people love, or are proud of themselves, or their own persons. However, you have stay'd long enough, me∣thinks, to have painted all the numberless Histories of old <HI>Ogygiae.</HI> If you have begun to be Historical, I recommend to your hand the story which every pious <HI>Irishman</HI> ought to begin with, that of St. <HI>Patrick:</HI> To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. <HI>P.</HI> was, when he translated the <HI>Batrachomuo∣machia</HI>) to come into <HI>England</HI> to copy the Frogs, and such other Vermine as were ne∣ver seen in that land since the time of that Confessor.</P>
<P>I long to see you a History Painter. You have already done enough for the Private, do something for the Publick; and be not confined, like the rest, to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us. The Ancients too expect you should do them right; those Statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the ac∣count you intend to write of their <HI>Charac∣ters.</HI> I hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble design.</P>
<P>As to your enquiry about your House, when I come within the walls, they put

For the spacious Mansion, like a <HI>Turkish</HI> Caravanserah, entertains the Vagabond with only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your Pictures about the Town. See what it is to have a Poet in your House! <HI>Frank</HI> in∣deed does all he can in such a Circumstance, for considering he has a wild Beast in it, he constantly keeps the Door chain'd. Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle, the rusty Hinges roar, the House seems so sensible that you are its support, that it is ready to drop in your Absence; but I still trust my self under its Roof, as depend∣ing that Providence will preserve so many <HI>Raphaels, Titian</HI> and <HI>Guido's,</HI> as are lodg'd in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one Poet can hardly be so heavy, as to bring an old House over the Heads of so many Painters. In a word, your House is fal∣ling, but what of that? I am only a Lodger.</P>

<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trou∣ble you with a Letter, but was discou∣raged for want of something that I could think worth sending fifteen hundred Miles. <HI>Italy</HI> is such an exhausted Subject, that, I dare say, you'd easily forgive my saying nothing of it; and the imagination of a Poet is a thing so nice and delicate, that it is no easy matter to find out Images capable of giving Pleasure to one of the few, who (in any Age) have come up to that Character. I am ne∣vertheless lately returned from an Island, where I passed three or four Months, which, were it set out in its true Colours, might methinks amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The Island <HI>Inarime</HI> is an Epitome of the whole Earth, containing within the compass of eighteen Miles, a won∣derful variety of Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains, and barren Mountains, all thrown together in a most romantic Confu∣sion.
<PB N="122" REF="138"/>
The Air is in the hottest Season con∣stantly refreshed by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales produce excellent Wheat and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, but are mostly covered with Vineyards, intermixt with Fruit-trees. Besides the common kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Peaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they produce Oran∣ges, Limes, Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Melons, and many other Fruits un∣known to our Climates, which lie every where open to the Passenger. The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines, some with Chesnut Groves, and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lentiscus. The Fields on the Northern side are divided by hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Foun∣tains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Landscape, which is likewise set off by the variety of some barren Spots, and naked Rocks. But that which crowns the Scene, is a large Mountain, rising out of the middle of the Island (once a terrible <HI>Volcano,</HI> by the Ancients called <HI>Mons Epomeus</HI>) its lower parts are adorned with Vines and other Fruits, the middle affords Pasture to flocks of Goats and Sheep, and the top is a sandy pointed Rock, from which you have the finest Prospect in the World, surveying at one view, besides several pleasant Islands lying at your Feet, a tract of <HI>Italy</HI> about three hundred Miles in length, from the Promontory of <HI>Antium,</HI> to
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
he Cape of <HI>Palinurus.</HI> The greater part of which hath been sung by <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> as making a considerable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes. The Islands <HI>Caprea, Prochyta,</HI> and <HI>Parthe∣nope,</HI> together with <HI>Cajeta, Cumae, Monte, Miseno,</HI> the Habitations of <HI>Circe,</HI> the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and the <HI>Lestrigones,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Promontory of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and the whole <HI>Campagnia felice,</HI> make but a part of this noble Landscape; which would demand an Imagination as warm, and numbers as flow∣ing as your own, to describe it. The Inha∣bitants of this delicious Isle, as they are without Riches and Honours, so are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them; and were they but as much strangers to Revenge, as they are to Avarice or Am∣bition, they might in fact answer the poeti∣cal Notions of the Golden Age. But they have got, as an alloy to their Happiness, an ill habit of murdering one another on flight Offences. We had an Instance of this the second Night after our Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being shot dead by our Door: And yet by the sole secret of minding our own business, we found a means of living securely among these dangerous People. Would you know how we pass the time at <HI>Naples?</HI> Our chief Entertainment is the Devotion of our Neighbours. Besides the
<PB N="124" REF="140"/>
gayety of their Churches (where Folks go to see what they call <HI>una Bella Devotione</HI> (i. e.) a sort of Religious Opera) they make Fire∣works almost every Week out of Devotion; the Streets are often hung with Arras out of Devotion; and (what is still more strange) the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Houses, and treat them with Musick and Sweetmeats, out of Devotion; in a word, were it not for this Devotion of its inhabitants, <HI>Naples</HI> would have little else to recommend it, be∣side the Air and Situation. Learning is in no very thriving state here, as indeed no where else in <HI>Italy.</HI> However, among many pretenders, some Men of taste are to be met with. A Friend of mine told me not long since, that being to visit <HI>Salvini</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> he found him reading your <HI>Homer.</HI> He liked the Notes extreamly, and could find no other fault with the Version, but that he thought it approached too near a Paraphrase; which shews him not to be sufficiently ac∣quainted with our Language. I wish you Health to go on with that noble Work, and when you have that, I need not wish you Success. You will do me the Justice to be∣lieve, that whatever relates to your Welfare, is sincerely wished, by</P>

<P>THE old project of a Window in the bosom, to render the Soul of Man visible, is what every honest friend has manifold reason to wish for; yet even that would not do in our case, while you are so far separated from me, and so long. I be∣gin to fear you'll die in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Denunciation will be fulfilled upon you, <HI>Hibernus es, &amp; in Hiberniam reverteris</HI>—I shou'd be apt to think you in <HI>Sancho</HI>'s case; some Duke has made you Governor of an Island, or wet place, and you are ad∣ministring Laws to the wild <HI>Irish.</HI> But I must own, when you talk of <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Planting,</HI> you touch my String; and I am as apt to pardon you, as the Fellow that thought himself <HI>Jupiter</HI> would have par∣don'd the other Madman who call'd him∣self his Brother <HI>Neptune.</HI> Alas Sir, do you know whom you talk to? One that had been a Poet, was degraded to a Translator, and at last thro' meer dulness is turn'd an Architect. You know <HI>Martial</HI>'s Censure—<HI>Praeconem facito, vel Architectum.</HI> However I have one way left, to plan, to <HI>elevate,</HI> and
<PB N="124" REF="143"/>
<HI>to surprize</HI> (as <HI>Bays</HI> says.) The next you may expect to hear, is that I am in Debt.</P>
<P>The History of my Transplantation and Settlement which you desire, would require a Volume, were I to enumerate the many projects, difficulties, vicissitudes, and vari∣ous fates attending that important part of my Life: Much more should I describe the many Draughts, Elevations, Profiles, Per∣spectives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of every Palace and Garden propos'd, intended, and happily raised, by the strength of that Faculty wherein all great Genius's excel, Imagination. At last, the Gods and Fate have fix'd me on the borders of the <HI>Thames,</HI> in the Districts of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Twickenham.</HI> It is here I have passed an entire Year of my life, without any fix'd abode in <HI>London,</HI> or more than casting a transitory glance (for a day or two at most in a Month) on the pomps of the Town. It is here I hope to receive you, Sir, return'd in triumph from Eternizing the <HI>Ireland</HI> of <HI>this Age.</HI> For you my Structures rise; for you my Colonades extend their Wings; for you my Groves aspire, and Roses bloom. And to say truth, I hope Posterity (which no doubt will be made acquainted with all these things) will look upon it as one of the principal Motives of my Architecture, that it was a Mansion prepar'd to receive you, against your own
<PB N="127" REF="144"/>

<P>What more can I tell you of my self? so much, and yet all put together so little, that I scarce care, or know, how to do it. But the very reasons that are against putting it upon Paper, are as strong for telling it you in Person; and I am uneasy to be so long deny'd the satisfaction of it.</P>
<P>At present I consider you bound in by the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, like the Ghosts in <HI>Virgil,</HI>

Poor <HI>Parnelle, Garth, Rowe!</HI> You justly reprove me for not speaking of the Death of the last: <HI>Parnelle</HI> was too much in my mind, to

whose Memory I am erecting the best Mo∣nument I can. What he gave me to publish, was but a small part of what he left behind him, but it was the best, and I will not make it worse by enlarging it. I'd fain know if he be buried at <HI>Chester,</HI> or <HI>Dublin;</HI> and what care has been, or is to be taken for his Monument, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet I have not neglected my Devoirs to Mr. <HI>Rowe;</HI> I am writing this very day his Epitaph for <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI>—After these; the best natur'd of Men, Sir <HI>Samuel Garth,</HI> has left me in the truest concern for his loss. His Death was very Heroical, and yet unaffected enough to have made a Saint, or a Philosopher fa∣mous: But ill Tongues, and worse Hearts have branded even his last Moments, as wrongfully as they did his Life, with Irre∣ligion. You must have heard many Tales on this Subject; but if ever there was a good Christian, without knowing himself to be so, it was Dr. <HI>Garth.</HI></P>

<P>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to see and converse with a Man, whom in his Writings I had so long known with Pleasure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very first meeting, doing justice to your dead friend Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I was not so happy as to know him; <HI>Virgilium tantum vidi</HI>—Had I been born early enough, I must have known and lov'd him: For I have been assur'd, not only by your self, but by Mr.
<PB N="2" REF="147"/>
<HI>Congreve</HI> and Sir <HI>William Trumbul,</HI> that his personal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwithstanding the many libel∣lous Misrepresentations of them, (against which the former of these Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He since did so, in his Dedication to the Duke of <HI>New∣castle,</HI> prefix'd to <HI>Tonson</HI>'s <HI>Duodecimo</HI> Edition of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Plays, 1717.</NOTE>.) I suppose those Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his success and fame: And those Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's Evening, which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glorious Season; (for his Fire, like the Sun's, shin'd clearest towards its set∣ting.)</P>
<P>You must not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own Perfor∣mances that they were above those Cri∣ticks, I was so vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be so humble as to think my self quite below their Notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na∣tural Inclination to Carrion: And though such poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is so poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is so beggarly but he can keep a Critic. So I'm sar from

thinking the Attacks of such people either any honour or dishonour, even to me, much less to Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI> I think with you, that whatever lesser Wits have risen since his Death, are but like Stars appearing when the Sun is set, that twinkle only in his Absence, and with the Rays they have borrowed from him. Our Wit (as you call it)is but Reflection or Imitation, there∣fore scarce to be call'd ours. True Wit, I believe, may be defin'd Justness of Thought, and a Facility of Expression; or (in the Midwives Phrase) a perfect Conception, with an easy Delivery. However this is far from a compleat Definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</P>

<P>I HAVE been so busy of late in cor∣recting and transcribing some of my Madrigals, for a great Man or two who desir'd to see them, that I have (with your Pardon) omitted to return you an Answer to your most ingenious Letter: So Scrib∣lers to the Publick, like Bankers to the Pub∣lick, are profuse in their voluntary Loans
<PB N="4" REF="149"/>
to it, whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more just Debts, to their best and nearest Friends. How∣ever, I hope, you who have as much Good-Nature as Good Sense, (since they gene∣rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In∣clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time should consider when you have oblig'd me beyond my present Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an honest Man, if he but intends to be just when he is able, tho' late. But I should be less just to you, the more I thought I could make a Re∣turn to so much Profuseness of Wit and Humanity together; which though they sel∣dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you so equally met, I know not in which you most abound. But so much for my Opinion of you, which is, that your Wit and Ingenuity is equall'd by no∣thing but your Judgment, or Modesty; which (though it be to please my self) I must no more offend, than I can do either right.</P>
<P>Therefore I will say no more now of them, than that your good Wit ne'er for∣feited your good Judgment, but in your Partiality to me and mine; so that if it
<PB N="5" REF="150"/>
were possible for a harden'd Scribler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited, than what I scribble my self; yet I must confess I ought to be more humbled by your Praise than exalted; which commends my little Sense with so much more of yours, that I am disparag'd and dishearten'd by your Com∣mendations; who give me an Example of your Wit in the first Part of your Letter, and a Definition of it in the last: to make writing well (that is, like you) more dif∣ficult to me than ever it was before. Thus the more great and just your Example and Definition of Wit are, the less I am capa∣ble to follow them. Then the best way of shewing my Judgment, after having seen how you write, is to leave off writing; and the best way to shew my Friendship to you, is to put an end to your Trouble, and to conclude</P>

<P>WHEN I write to you, I foresee a long Letter, and ought to beg your
<PB N="6" REF="151"/>
Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longest, it will be of course the worst I have troubled you with. Yet to express my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Interest; as some People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindness, to put you in mind of bestowing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more distinctly I see my Faults; Spots and Blemishes, you know, are never so plainly discover'd as in the brightest Sun∣shine. Thus I am mortified by those Com∣mendations which were design'd to encou∣rage me: for Praise to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode∣rately bestow'd, it chears and revives; but if too lavishly, overcharges and depresses him. Most Men in years, as they are ge∣nerally discouragers of Youth, are like old Trees, that being past Bearing themselves, will suffer no young Plants to flourish be∣neath them: But as if it were not enough to have out-done all your Coaevals in Wit, you will excel them in Good-Nature too. As for my <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">His <HI>Pastorals,</HI> written at 16 Years of Age.</NOTE>green Essays, if you find any pleasure in 'em, it must be such as a Man naturally takes in observing the first Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he

has rais'd himself: and 'tis impossible they should be esteem'd any otherwise, than as we value Fruits for being early, which ne∣vertheless are the most insipid, and the worst of the Year. In a word, I must blame you for treating me with so much Compliment, which is at best but the Smoak of Friendship. I neither write, nor con∣verse with you, to gain your Praise, but your Affection. Be so much my Friend as to appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults, if not as a young Man, at least as an un∣experienc'd Writer.</P>

<P>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <HI>March</HI> I have received, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Justice, for giving you your Due; who shou'd not let your Modesty be so unjust to your Merit, as to reject
<PB N="8" REF="153"/>
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is so short of your desert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend∣ship, (as you say) however you must allow there is no Smoak but there is some Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incense offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half so sweet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; so Friendship, like Love, cannot be without some Incense, to perfume the Name it would praise and immortalize. But since you say you do not write to me to gain my <HI>Praise,</HI> but my <HI>Affection,</HI> pray how is it possible to have the one without the other? We must admire besore we love. You affirm, you would have me so much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be so hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be persuaded to it. Be∣sides, the Vanity of a Scribler is such, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; especially when he must take pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your self, I cannot suffer you to murther your Fame, with your own hand, without opposing you; especially when you say your last Let∣ter

is the worst (since the longest) you have favoured me with; which I therefore think the best, as the longest Life (if a good one) is the best, as it yields the more Variety and is more Exemplary; as a chearful Summer's Day, tho' longer than a dull one in the Winter, is less tedious and more entertain∣ing: Therefore let but your Friendship be like your Letter, as lasting as it is agreeable, and it can never be tedious, but more ac∣ceptable and obliging to</P>

<P>I HAVE receiv'd yours of the Fifth, wherein your Modesty refuses the just Praises I give you, by which you lay claim to more, as a Bishop gains his Bishoprick, by saying he will not Episcopate: But I must confess, whilst I displease you by commend∣ing you, I please my self; just as Incense is sweeter to the Offerer than the Deity to whom 'tis offered, by his being so much above it: For indeed, every Man partakes of the Praise he gives, when it is so justly given.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="155"/>
As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the <HI>Muses,</HI> you may allow me to make it, since no old Man can give so young, so great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea∣lousy. I am, in my Enquiry, like old Sir <HI>Bernard Gascoign,</HI> who us'd to say, That when he was grown too old to have his Visits admitted alone by the Ladies, he always took along with him a young Man, to ensure his Welcome to them; who, had he come alone had been rejected, only because his Visits were not scandalous to them. So I am (like an old Rook, who is ruin'd by Gaming) forc'd to live on the good Fortune of the pushing young Men, whose Fancies are so vigorous, that they ensure their Suc∣cess in their Adventures with the Muses, by their Strength of Imagination.</P>
<P>—Your Papers are safe in my Custody (you may be sure) from any one's Theft but my own; for 'tis as dangerous to trust a Scribler with your Wit, as a Gamester with the Custody of your Money.—If you happen to come to Town, you will make it more difficult for me to leave it, who am, dear Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI></P>

<P>I Cannot contend with you. You must give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your Design is to encourage me. But I separate from all the rest that Paragraph or two, in which you make me so warm an Offer of your Friend∣ship. Were I possess'd of That, it would put an end to all those Speeches with which you now make me blush; and change them to wholesome Advices, and free Sen∣timents, which might make me wiser and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friendship is best contracted betwixt Persons of equal Age: but I have so much Interest to be of another Mind, that you must pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in opposition to that Opinion.</P>
<P>In the first place 'tis observable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally caused by our finding the same Dispositions in them, which we feel in our selves. This is but Self-love at the bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be such, the Inclinations of such
<PB N="12" REF="157"/>
being commonly various. The Friendship of two young Men is often occasioned by Love of Pleasure or Voluptuousness, each being desirous, for his own sake, of one to assist or incourage him in the Courses he pursues; as that of two old Men is fre∣quently on the score of some Profit, Lucre, or Design upon others. Now, as a young Man who is less acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability less of Interest; and an old Man who may be weary of himself, less of Self-love; so the Friendship between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self∣regard. One may add to this, that such a Friendship is of greater Use and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to please the young one; and the young Man more discreet and pru∣dent by the help of the old one: so it may prove a Cure of those epidemical Diseases of Age and Youth, Sourness and Madness. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Possibility of this; One alone abundantly satisfies me, and con∣vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> under Seventeen.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Shou'd believe my self happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me so much in a Style of Compliment. It has been observ'd of Women, that they are more subject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac∣count of their being generally treated this way; but the weakest Women are not more so than that weak Class of Men, who are thought to pique them∣selves upon their Wit. The World is ne∣ver wanting, when a Coxcomb is accom∣plishing himself, to help to give him the finishing Stroke.</P>
<P>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh∣bour overstock'd with Vanity, yet I can∣not but fancy, there are certain Times, when most people are in a disposition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a vast Good a little Truth might do, spo∣ken in such seasons. A very small Alms will do a great kindness, to people in ex∣tream necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="159"/>
I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think himself more oblig'd to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Follies. If you would make those the Subject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wish your Letters always were.</P>
<P>I do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty (as you are pleas'd to say) in writing to me, since you have always chosen the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my Verses which you praise so much, I may truly say they had never been the cause of any Vanity in me, ex∣cept what they gave me when they first occasion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have several times since been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, the greatest magnifying Glasses in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per∣son; yet even in those, I cannot fancy my self so extremely like <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as you wou'd persuade me: If I must be like him, 'tis you will make me so,
<PB N="15" REF="160"/>
by complimenting me into a better opinion of my self than I deserve: They made him think he was the <HI>Son of Jupiter,</HI> and you assure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can say to my honour? You said ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I possess'd a share in your Af∣fection, to treat me with Compliments and sweet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <HI>Sancho 'Panca:</HI> They had persuaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to subsist up∣on but <HI>Wafers</HI> and <HI>Marmalade.</HI> In our Days, the greatest obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wise Men give them their Way, and please them as well as they can; so when those incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco∣verably Be-Mus'd, the best way both to quiet them, and secure your selves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the most part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be hear∣tily glad that all you say were as true, ap∣ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your self, for several weighty Reasons; but for none so much, as that I might be to you what you
<PB N="16" REF="161"/>

<P>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country; from <HI>Will</HI>'s Coffee-House to <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the com∣mon Town-Wits, and the downright Coun∣try Fools; that the first are pertly in the Wrong, with a little more Flourish and Gaiety, and the last neither in the Right nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a stupid, settled Medium betwixt both. However, methinks these are most in the Right, who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle Reign of Dulness, which the Wits must do at last, tho' after a great deal of Noise, Pother, and Resistance. Ours are a sort of modest, inoffensive People, who neither have Sense, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulness. They are commonly known in the World by the Name of honest, civil Gentlemen. They live much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting Life, pursuing with earnestness and hazard, something not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but preser Solitude to the Company of all these; for tho' a
<PB N="18" REF="163"/>
Man's self may possibly be the worst Fel∣low to converse with in the world, yet one would think the Company of a Person whom we have the greatest regard to, and affection for, could not be very un∣pleasant: As a Man in love with a Mi∣stress, desires no conversation but hers, so a Man in love with himself, (as most Men are) may be best pleased with his own. Besides, if the truest and most useful Know∣ledge, be the Knowledge of our selves, So∣litude conducing most to make us look into our selves, should be the most instructive State of Life. We see nothing more com∣monly, than Men, who for the sake of the circumstantial Part, and meer outside of Life, have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature, and ought to be sent into Solitude to study themselves over again. People are usually spoil'd instead of being taught, at their coming into the World; whereas by being more conversant with Obseurity, without any Pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So∣litude is his best School; and if he be a Fool, it is his best Sanctuary.</P>
<P>These are good Reasons for my own Stay here, but I wish I could give you any for your coming hither, except that I earnestly invite you. And yet I can't help
<PB N="19" REF="164"/>
saying, I have suffered a great deal of dis∣content that you do not, tho' I so little merit that you should.</P>

<P>YOURS of the 26th of <HI>October</HI> I have received, as I have always done yours, with no little Satisfaction, and am proud to discover by it, that you find fault with the shortness of mine, which I think the best Excuse for it: And tho' they (as you say) who have most Wit or Money, are most sparing of either; there are some who ap∣pear Poor to be thought Rich, and are Poor, which is my Case: I cannot but rejoice, that you have undergone so much discontent for want of my company; but if you have a mind to punish me for my fault, (which I could not help) defer your coming to Town, and you will do it ef∣fectually. But I know your Charity always exceeds your Revenge, so that I will not

despair of seeing you, who, in return to your inviting me to your Forest, invite you to my Forest, the Town; where the Beasts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long Ears or Horns, pursue one another either out of Love or Hatred. You may have the Pleasure to see one Pack of Blood∣hounds pursue another Herd of Brutes, to bring each other to their Fall, which is their whole Sport: Or, if you affect a less bloody Chace, you may see a Pack of Spa∣niels, called <HI>Lovers,</HI> in a hot pursuit of a two legg'd <HI>Vixen,</HI> who only flies the whole low'd Pack to be singled out by one Dog, who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest, as they are making a Noise, to the Loss of their Game. In fine, this is the Time for all sorts of Sport in the Town, when those of the Country cease; there∣fore leave your Forest of Beasts, for ours of Brutes, call'd Men, who now in full Cry, (pack'd by the Court or Country) run down in the House of Commons, a de∣serted horned Beast of the Court, to the satisfaction of their Spectators: Besides, (more for your Diversion) you may see not only the two great Play-houses of the Nation, those of the Lords and Commons, in Dispute with one another; but the two other Play-houses in high Contest, because the Members of one House are remov'd
<PB N="21" REF="166"/>
up to t'other, (as it is often done by the Court for Reasons of State.) Insomuch that the lower Houses, I mean the Play-houses, are going to act Tragedies on one another without Doors, and the Sovereign is put to it (as it often happens in the other two Houses) to silence one or both, to keep Peace between them. Now I have told you all the News of the Town.</P>

<P>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with my Paper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <HI>Miscellany</HI> of <HI>Bern. Lintot</HI>'s, and in the present Edition of the Posthumous Works of Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI></NOTE> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> corrected. I own you have made more of it by making it less, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are said to burn half the Spices they bring home to inhance the Price of the remainder, so to be greater Gainers by their Loss, (which is indeed my Case now.) Well; you have prun'd my sading Laurels of some superfluous, sapless,
<PB N="22" REF="167"/>
and dead Branches, to make the remainder live the longer; thus like your Master <HI>Apollo,</HI> you are at once a Poet and a Physician.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town, your Good-Nature was the first Cause of my confident request; but excuse me, I must I see say no more upon this Subject, since I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with: tho' you have given me some Encouragement to hope, our Friendship tho' young might be without Shyness, or criminal Modesty; for a Friend, like a Mistress, tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not to refuse a Friend's kindness because it is small or trivial: I have told you (I think) that a <HI>Spanish</HI> Lady said to her poor, po∣etical Gallant, that a Queen if she lay with a Groom, would expect a mark of his kindness from him, tho' it were but his Curry-comb. But you and I will dispute this Matter when I am so happy as to see you here; and perhaps 'tis the only Dis∣pute in which I might hope to have the better of you.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, to make you another excuse for my boldness in inviting you to Town, I design'd to leave with you some more of my Papers, (since these return so much bet∣ter out of your Hands than they went from mine) for I intended (as I told you formerly)
<PB N="23" REF="168"/>
to spend a Month, or six Weeks this Sum∣mer, near you in the Country; for you may be assured there is nothing I desire so much, as an Improvement of your Friendship—</P>

I will give you my Reason for this Request of mine, when I see you; which I am resolv'd shall be when I have done here, and at the <HI>Bath,</HI> where I design to go, and afterwards to spend two Months (God willing) with you at <HI>Binfield,</HI> or near it—</P>

<P>BY yours of the last Month, you desire me to select, if possible, some Things from the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Printed in <HI>Folio,</HI> in the Year 1704.</NOTE>first Volume of your Miscel∣lanies, which may be alter'd so as to ap∣pear again. I doubted your meaning in this; whether it was to pick out the best of those Verses, (as that on the <HI>Idleness of Business;</HI> on <HI>Ignorance;</HI> on <HI>Laziness,</HI> &amp;c.) to make the Method and Numbers exact, and avoid Repetitions? For tho' (upon reading 'em on this occasion) I believe they might receive such an Alteration with advantage; yet they would not be chang'd so much, but any one would know 'em for the same at first sight. Or if you mean to improve the worst Pieces, which are such as to render them very good, would require a great addition, and almost the entire new writing of them? Or, lastly, if you mean the middle sort, as the Songs and Love-Verses? For these will need only to be shortned, to omit repetition; the Words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know
<PB N="25" REF="170"/>
your mind in this, for I am utterly at a loss. Yet I have try'd what I could do to some of the <HI>Songs,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Letter of</HI> Nov. 20, 1707. <HI>a.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Poems</HI> on <HI>Lazi∣ness</HI> and <HI>Ignorance,</HI> but can't (e'en in my own partial Judgment) think my altera∣tions much to the purpose. So that I must needs desire you would apply your Gare wholly at present, to those which are yet unpublished, of which there are more than enough to make a consierable Volume, of full as good ones, nay, I verily believe, of better than any in Vol. I. which I could wish you would defer, at least 'till you have finish'd these that are yet unprinted.</P>
<P>I send you a Sample of some few of these; namely; the Verses to Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> in <HI>his old Age;</HI> your new ones on the <HI>Duke of Marlborough,</HI> and two others. I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them: Some I have con∣tracted, as we do Sun-beams, to improve their Energy and Force; some I have ta∣ken quite away, as we take Branches from a Tree, to add to the Fruit; others I have entirely new express'd, and turned more into Poetry. <HI>Donne</HI> (like one of his Suc∣cessors) had infinitely more Wit than he wanted Versification: for the great dealers
<PB N="26" REF="171"/>
in Wit, like those in Trade, take least Pains to set off their Goods; while the Ha∣berdashers of small Wit, spare for no De∣corations or Ornaments. You have com∣mission'd me to paint your Shop, and I have done my best to brush you up like your Neighbours. But I can no more pre∣tend to the Merit of the Production, than a Midwife to the Virtues and good Quali∣ties of the Child she helps into the Light.</P>
<P>The few Things I have entirely added, you will excuse; you may take them law∣fully for your own, because they are no more than Sparks lighted up by your Fire; and you may omit them at last, if you think them but Squibs in your Triumphs.</P>

<P>I HAVE received yours of the 26th, as kind as it is ingenious, for which therefore I most heartily thank you: It would have been much more welcome to me, had it not inform'd me of your want of Health: But you who have a Mind so

vigorous, may well be contented with its crazy Habitation; since (you know) the old Similitude says, The Keenness of the Mind soonest wears out the Body; as the sharpest Sword soonest destroys the Scabbard: So that (as I say) you must be satisfied with your apprehension of an uneasy Life, (tho' I hope not a short one;) notwithstanding that generally you sound Wits (tho' weak Bodies) are immortal hereafter, by that Genius which shortens your present Life to prolong that of the future. But I yet hope, your great, vigorous, and active Mind, will not be able to destroy your little, tender, and crazy Carcass.</P>
<P>Now to say something to what you write, concerning the present epidemick Distem∣per of the Mind and Age, Calumny; I know it is no more to be avoided (at one time or another of our Lives) than a Fever, or an Ague; and as often those Distem∣pers attend, or threaten the best Constitu∣tions, from the worst Air; so does that malignant Air of Calumny, soonest attack the sound and elevated in Mind, as Storms of Wind the tallest and most fruitful Trees; whilst the low and weak, for bowing and moving to and fro, are, by their Weakness, secure from the danger and violence of the Tempest.

<P>I Receiv'd yours of the 9th yesterday, which has (like the rest of your Let∣ters) at once pleas'd and instructed me; so that I assure you, you can no more write too much to your absent Friends, than speak too much to the present. This is a Truth that all Men own, who have either seen your Writings, or heard your Dis∣course; enough to make others show their Judgment, in ceasing to write or talk, es∣pecially to you, or in your company. How∣ever, I speak or write to you, not to please you, but my self; since I provoke your Answers; which, whilst they humble me, give me vanity; tho' I am lessen'd by you even when you commend me; since you commend my little Sense with so much more of yours, that you put me out of Counte∣nance, whilst you would keep me in it. So that you have found a way (against the Custom of great Wits) to shew even a great deal of Good-Nature with a great deal of good Sense.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="174"/>
I thank you for the Book you promis'd me, by which I find you would not only correct my Lines, but my Life.</P>
<P>As to the damn'd Verses I entrusted you with, I hope you will let them undergo your Purgatory, to save them from other People's damning them; since the Criticks, who are generally the first damn'd in this Life, like the Damn'd below, never leave to bring those above them under their own Circumstances. I beg you to peruse my Papers, and select what you think best, or most tolerable, and look over them again; for I resolve suddenly to print some of them, as a harden'd old Gamester will (in spite of all former ill usage by Fortune) push on an ill Hand, in expectation of re∣covering himself; especially, since I have such a <HI>Croupier</HI> or Second to stand by me as Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>Englefyld</HI> being upon his Journey to <HI>London,</HI> tells me I must write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his desire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it so lately by the Mes∣senger you sent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair Copy of the <HI>Poem</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> Hand, is in the <HI>Harley-Library,</HI> among other such <HI>Brouillons</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wycher∣ley</HI>'s Poems, corrected by him. <HI>Vid. Lett. Ap.</HI> 10, 1705/6. <HI>Note</HI> (a.)</NOTE> on <HI>Dulness,</HI> which was not then finish'd, and which I should not care to hazard by the common Post. Mr. <HI>Englefyld</HI> is ignorant of the Contents, and I hope your prudence will let him re∣main so, for my sake no less than your own: Since if you should reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder Re∣ports should be rais'd, and there are those (I fear) who would be ready to improve them to my disadvantage. I am sorry you told the great Man, whom you met in the <HI>Court of Requests,</HI> that your Papers were in my hands: No Man alive shall ever know any such thing from me; and
<PB N="31" REF="176"/>
I give you this warning besides, that tho' your self should say I had any way assi∣sted you, I am notwithstanding resolv'd to deny it.</P>
<P>The method of the Copy I send you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I desire you to compare it by the <HI>Figures</HI> in the Margin, answer∣ing to the same in this Letter. The Poem is now divided into four Parts, mark'd with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The first contains the <HI>Praise</HI> of Dulness, and shews how upon several suppositions, it passes for 1. Religion. 2. Philosophy. 3. Example. 4. Wit. And 5. The cause of Wit, and the end of it. The second Part contains the <HI>Advantages</HI> of Dulness: 1st, In Busi∣ness; and 2dly, at Court; where the Si∣militudes of the Byass of a Bowl, and the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend∣ing to illustrate those advantages of Dul∣ness, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them; (which was your only objection to my ad∣ding them.) The third contains the <HI>Happi∣ness</HI> of Dulness in all Stations, and shews in a great many Particulars, that it is so fortunate, as to be esteem'd some good Quality or other in all sorts of People; that it is thought Quiet, Sense, Caution,
<PB N="32" REF="177"/>
Policy, Prudence, Majesty, Valour, Cir∣cumspection, Honesty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which sums up all the <HI>praise, advantage,</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of Dulness in a few words, and strengthens them all by the opposition of the <HI>disgrace, disadvantage,</HI> and <HI>unhappiness</HI> of Wit, with which it concludes<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the present Edition: Some of the Lines in the H. M. are these.
<Q><L>Thus Dulness, the safe Opiate of the Mind,</L>
<L>The last kind refuge weary Wit can find,</L>
<L>Fit for all stations, and in each content,</L>
<L>Is satisfy'd, secure, and innocent;</L>
<L>No pains it takes, and no offence it gives,</L>
<L>Un-fear'd, unhated, undisturb'd it lives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho' the whole be as short again as at first, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of something in your first Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they seem'd encompass'd with too many words; and some new express'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll see parti∣cularly in the Simile of the <HI>Clock-Weights;</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">It was originally thus express'd:
<Q><L>As Clocks run fastest when most Lead is on.</L></Q>
We find it so in a Letter of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> dated <HI>April</HI> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Verses of his, <HI>To the Author of a Poem call'd Successio,</HI> which got out in a Miscellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> died, and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publish∣ing any Poems.</NOTE>
<PB N="33" REF="178"/>
and the Versification throughout, is, I be∣lieve such, as no body can be shock'd at. The repeated Permissions you give me of dealing freely with you, will (I hope) ex∣cuse what I have done; for if I have not spar'd you when I thought Severity would do you a kindness, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no absolute need of Amputation. As to Particulars, I can satisfy you better when we meet; in the mean time, pray write to me when you can, you cannot too often.</P>

<P>YOU may see by my Stile, I had the happiness and satisfaction to receive yesterday (by the hands of that Wagg, Mr. <HI>Englefyld</HI>) your extreme kind and obliging Letter of the 20th of this Month; which, like all the rest of yours, did at once mor∣tify me, and make me vain; since it tells me with so much more Wit, Sense and Kindness than mine can express, that my Letters are always welcome to you. So that even whilst your Kindness invites me to write to you, your Wit and Judgment
<PB N="34" REF="179"/>
forbids me; since I may return you a Let∣ter, but never an Answer.</P>
<P>Now, as for my owning your assistance to me, in over-looking my unmusical Num∣bers, and harsher Sense, and correcting them both, with your Genius, or Judg∣ment; I must tell you I always own it, (in spite of your unpoetick Modesty) who would do with your Friendship as your Charity; conceal your Bounty to magnify the Obligation; and even whilst you lay on your Friend the Favour, acquit him of the Debt: But that shall not serve your turn; I will always own, 'tis my infallible Pope has, or would redeem me from a poetical Damning, the second time; and save my Rhimes from being condemn'd to the Criticks Flames to all Eternity: But (by the Faith you prosess) you know your Works of Supererrogation, transfer'd upon an humble, acknowledging Sinner, may save even Him; having good Works enough of your own besides, to ensure yours, and their Immortality.</P>
<P>And now for the pains you have taken to recommend my <HI>Dulness,</HI> by making it more methodical, I give you a thousand thanks; since true and natural <HI>Dulness</HI> is shown more by its pretence to form and method, as the Sprightliness of Wit by its despising both. I thank you a thousand

<P>THE Compliments you make me, in regard of any inconsiderable Service I could do you, are very unkind, and do but tell me in other words, that my Friend has so mean an opinion of me, as to think I expect acknowledgments for trifles; which upon my faith I shall equally take amiss, whether made to my self, or to any others. For God's sake, (my dear Friend <HI>Wycherley</HI>) think better of me, and believe I desire no sort of Favour so much, as that of serving you, more considerably than I have yet been able to do.</P>
<P>I shall proceed in this manner, with some others of your Pieces; but since you

desire I would not deface your Copy for the future, and only mark the Repetitions; I must, as soon as I've mark'd these, tran∣scribe what is left on another Paper; and in that, blot, alter, and add all I can de∣vise, for their Improvement. For you are sensible, the Omission of <HI>Repetitions</HI> is but one, and the easiest Part, of yours and my Design; there remaining besides to rectify the <HI>Method,</HI> to <HI>connect</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> and to mend the <HI>Expression</HI> and <HI>Versification.</HI> I will go next upon the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some <HI>Broüillons</HI> of these, transcrib'd and very much blotted by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> are extant in the <HI>Harley Library.</HI></NOTE>Poems of <HI>Solitude,</HI> on the <HI>Publick,</HI> and on the <HI>mixt Life:</HI> the <HI>Bill of Fare;</HI> the <HI>Praises of Avarice,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>I must take some Notice of what you say, of <Q REND="inline">"My pains to make your Dulness methodical;"</Q> and of your hint, that <Q REND="inline">"The sprightliness of Wit despises method."</Q> This is true enough, if by <HI>Wit</HI> you mean no more than <HI>Fancy</HI> or <HI>Conceit;</HI> but in the better notion of <HI>Wit,</HI> consider'd as propriety, surely <HI>Method</HI> is not only neces∣sary for Perspicuity and Harmony of parts, but gives beauty even to the minute and particular thoughts, which receive an ad∣ditional advantage from those which pre∣cede or follow in their due place: Ac∣cording

and sorry for the report: In the first place, glad that it was not true; and in the next sorry that it shou'd give you any distur∣bance, or concern more than ordinary for me; for which, as well as your concern for my future well-being or life, I think my self most eternally oblig'd to you; as∣suring, your concern for either will make me more careful of both. Yet for your sake I love this Life so well, that I shall the less think of the other; but 'tis in your power to ensure my Happiness in one and the other, both by your society and good Example, so not only contribute to my fe∣licity here, but hereaster.</P>
<P>Now as to your Excuse for the plain∣ness of your Style, or Letter, I must needs tell you, that Friendship is much more ac∣ceptable to a true Friend than Wit, which is generally salse Reasoning; and a Friend's reprimand often shews more Friendship than his compliment: Nay Love, which is more than Friendship, is often seen, by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes.

<P>I HAVE made a damn'd Compliment in Verse, upon the printing your Pasto∣rals, which you shall see when you see me.—If you suffer my old Dowdy of a Muse to wait upon your sprightly Lass

<P>I MUST thank you for a Book of your Miscellanies, which <HI>Tonson</HI> sent me, I suppose by your Order; and all I can tell you of it is, that nothing has lately been better receiv'd by the Publick, than your part of it; you have only displeas'd the Criticks by pleasing them too well; ha∣ving not left them a Word to say for them∣selves, against you and your performances; so that now your hand is in, you must per∣severe, 'till my Prophesies of you be ful∣fill'd. In earnest, all the best Judges of good Sense, or Poetry, are Admirers of yours; and like your Part of the Book so well, that the rest is lik'd the worse. This is true upon my word, without Compli∣ment; so that your first Success will make you for all your Life a Poet, in spite of your Wit; for a Poet's Success at first,
<PB N="43" REF="188"/>
like a Gamester's Fortune at first, is like to make him a loser at last, and to be undone by his good fortune and merit.</P>
<P>But hitherto your Miscellanies have safe∣ly run the Gantlet, through all the Coffee∣houses; which are now entertain'd with a whimsical new News-Paper, call'd, <HI>The Tatler,</HI> which I suppose you have seen. This is the newest thing I can tell you of, except it be of the Peace, which now (most People say) is drawing to such a Conclusion, as all <HI>Europe</HI> is, or must be satisfy'd with; so Poverty, you see, which makes Peace in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> makes it likewise in the Camp or Field, throughout the World: Peace then be to you, and to me; who am now grown peaceful, and will have no Contest with any Man, but him who says he is more your Friend, or humble Servant, than</P>

are as bad Poets in this Nation as your Servant. This modern Custom of appear∣ing in Miscellanies, is very useful to the Poets, who, like other Thieves, escape by getting into a Crowd, and herd together like <HI>Banditti,</HI> safe only in their Multitude. Methinks <HI>Strada</HI> has given a good De∣scription of these kind of Collections; <HI>Nullus hodiè mortalium aut nascitur, aut moritur, aut praeliatur, aut rusticatur, aut abit peregrè; aut redit, aut nubit; aut est, aut non est, (nam etiammortuis isti canunt) cui non illi extemplò cudant Epicaedia, Genethliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, E∣pithalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Soteri∣ca, Paraenetica, Naenias, Nugas.</HI> As to the success which you say my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you were pleas'd to say of me to the World; which you do well to call your <HI>Prophesy,</HI> since whatever is said in my favour, must be a Prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can perform. My Pastoral Muse, like other Country Girls, is but put out of Countenance, by what you Courtiers say to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young Scribler's Vanity needs no Re∣cruits from abroad: for Nature, like an in∣dulgent Mother, kindly takes care to sup∣ply
<PB N="45" REF="190"/>
her Sons with as much of their own, as is necessary for their Satisfaction. If my Verses should meet with a few flying Com∣mendations, <HI>Virgil</HI> has taught me that a young Author has not too much reason to be pleas'd with them, when he considers, that the natural consequence of Praise, is Envy and Calumny.

<P>THE last I receiv'd from you, was dated the 22d of <HI>May.</HI> I take your charitable hint to me very kindly, where∣in you do like a true Friend, and a true Christian, and I shall endeavour to follow your Advice, as well as your Example.—As for your wishing to see your Friend an Hermit with you, I cannot be said to leave the World, since I shall enjoy in your conversation, all that I can desire of it; nay, can learn more from you alone, than from my long Experience of the great, or little Vulgar in it.</P>
<P>As to the Success of your Poems in the late Miscellany, I told you of in my last; (upon my word) I made you no Compli∣ment, for you may be assur'd, that all sorts of Readers like them, except they are

Writers too; but for them, (I must needs say) the more they like them, they ought to be the less pleas'd with 'em: So that you do not come off with a bare <HI>Saving Game</HI> (as you call it) but have gain'd so much Credit at first, that you must needs support it to the last: Since you set up with so great a Stock of good Sense, Judg∣ment and Wit, that your Judgment ensures all that your Wit ventures at. The Salt of your Wit has been enough to give a re∣lish to the whole insipid Hotch-Potch it is mingled <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The sixth Volume of <HI>Tonson</HI>'s Miscellanies.</NOTE> with; and you will make <HI>Jacob</HI>'s <HI>Ladder</HI> raise you to Immortality, by which others are turn'd off shamefully, to their Damnation (for poetick Thieves as they are) who think to be sav'd by others good Works, how faulty soever their own are: But the Coffee-house Wits, or rather Anti-Wits, the Critics, prove their Judg∣ments by approving your Wit; and even the News-Mongers and Poets will own, you have more Invention than they; nay, the Detracters or the Envious, who never speak well of any body, (not even of those they think well of in their absence) yet will give you (even in your absence) their good Word; and the <HI>Criticks</HI> only hate you,

<P>MY Letters, so much inferior to yours, can only make up their scarcity of Sense by their number of Lines; which is like the <HI>Spaniards</HI> paying a debt of Gold with a load of brass Money.

to commend in me seriously; who have gi∣ven no sign of my Judgment, but my Opi∣nion of yours, nor mark of my Wit, but my leaving off Writing, to the publick, now you are beginning, to shew the World, what you can do by yours; whose Wit is as spiritual as your Judgment infallible; in whose Judgment I have an implicit Faith, and shall always subscribe to it to save my Works in this World, from the Flames and Damnation.—Pray present my most hum∣ble Service to Sir <HI>W. Trumbull;</HI> for whom and whose Judgment I have so profound a respect, that his Example had almost made me marry, more than my Nephew's ill Carriage to me; having once resolv'd to have reveng'd my self upon him by my Marriage, but now am resolv'd to make my revenge greater upon him by his Mar∣riage.</P>

<P>I HAVE had yours of the 30th of the last Month, which is kinder than I de∣sire it shou'd be, since it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to be sick again in Town
<PB N="50" REF="195"/>
in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of Happiness than of Health; yet, my dear Friend, set raillery or compliment aside, I can bear your ab∣sence (which procures your Health and Ease) better than I can your company when you are in Pain; for I cannot see you so without being so too. Your love to the Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope) my love to it or you, since there I can en∣joy your company without seeing you in Pain to give me Satisfaction and Pleasure; there I can have you without Rivals or Di∣sturbers; without the C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s too civil, or the T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s too rude; without the Noise of the Loud, and the Censure of the Silent; and wou'd rather have you abuse me there with the Truth, than at this distance with your Compliment: Since now, your busi∣ness of a Friend and kindness to a Friend, is by finding fault with his Faults, and mending them by your obliging Severity. I hope (in point of your good nature) you will have no cruel Charity for those Pa∣pers of mine, you were so willing to be troubled with; which I take most infinite∣ly kind of you, and shall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can do more for his Friend than preserving his Reputation (nay not by preserving his Life)
<PB N="51" REF="196"/>
since by preserving his Life he can only make him live about threescore or four∣score Years; but by preserving his Reputa∣tion, he can make him live as long as the World lasts; so save him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <HI>Newgate,</HI> to save them from condemnation by the Publick. Be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults, and do with my Papers, as you Country-gentlemen do with your Trees, slash, cut, and lop-off the Excres∣cencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bays, that the little remainder may live the lon∣ger, and increase the value of them, by di∣minishing the number. I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Pleasure, notwithstanding your compliment, which says, you take the trou∣ble kindly: Such is the generosity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de∣sired by them to do them a kindness; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them. Wherefore you may be sure to be troubled with my Letters out of Interest, if not Kindness; since mine to you will procure yours to me, so that I write to you more for my own sake than yours; less to make you think I write well, than to learn from
<PB N="52" REF="197"/>
you to write better. Thus you see Interest in my Kindness, which is like the Friend∣ship of the World, rather to make a Friend than be a Friend; but I am yours, as a true <HI>Plain-dealer.</HI></P>

<P>I AM sorry you persist to take ill my not accepting your Invitation, and to find (if I mistake not) your Exception not unmixt with some Suspicion. Be certain I shall most carefully observe your Re∣quest, not to cross over, or deface the Copy of your Papers for the future, and only to mark in the Margin the Repetitions: But as this can serve no further than to get rid of those Repetitions, and no way rectify the <HI>Method,</HI> nor <HI>connect</HI> the <HI>Matter,</HI> nor improve the <HI>Poetry</HI> in <HI>Expression</HI> or <HI>Numbers,</HI> without further blotting, adding, and altering; so it really is my opinion, and desire, that you should take your Pa∣pers out of my hands into your own; and that no Alterations may be made but when

both of us are present; when you may be satisfied with every Blot, as well as every Addition, and nothing be put upon the Papers, but what you shall give your own sanction and assent to, at the same time.</P>
<P>Do not be so unjust, as to imagine from hence that I would decline any part of this Task: On the contrary you know, I have been at the pains of transcribing some Pieces, at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the Copy, and yet to lose no Time in proceeding upon the Correction.

I hope when I have the happiness of seeing you again in <HI>London,</HI> not only to read over the Verses I have now of yours, but more that you have written since; for I make no doubt but any one who writes so well, must write more. Not that I think the most voluminous Poets al∣ways the best, I believe the contrary is ra∣ther true. I mention'd somewhat to you in <HI>London</HI> of a <HI>Pastoral Comedy,</HI> which I should be glad to hear you had thought upon since. I find <HI>Menage</HI> in his observa∣tions upon <HI>Tasso</HI>'s <HI>Aminta,</HI> reckons up four∣score Pastoral Plays in <HI>Italian:</HI> And in look∣ing over my old <HI>Italian</HI> Books, I find a great many Pastorals and Piscatory Plays, which I suppose <HI>Menage</HI> reckons together. I find also by <HI>Menage,</HI> that <HI>Tasso</HI> is not the first that writ in that kind, he mentioning an∣other before him, which he himself had never seen, nor indeed have I. But as the <HI>Aminta, Pastor Fido,</HI> and <HI>Filli di Sciro</HI> of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> are the three best, so I think there

is no dispute but <HI>Aminta</HI> is the best of the three: Not but that the Discourses in <HI>Pa∣stor Fido</HI> are more entertaining and copious in several peoples opinion, tho' not so pro∣per for Pastoral; and the Fable of <HI>Bonarelli</HI> more surprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with success. <HI>Racan</HI>'s <HI>Bergeries</HI> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are all too full of Conceits. <HI>Rapin</HI> will have the design of Pastoral Plays to be taken from the <HI>Cyclops</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI> I am sure there is nothing of this kind in <HI>English</HI> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your self.

<P>I Cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those Papers of mine. You have no less right to correct me, than the same hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<PB N="62" REF="207"/>
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint∣ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an∣other, till they stiffen and deaden the Piece. Besides to bestow heightning on every part is monstrous: Some parts ought to be lower than the rest; and nothing looks more ri∣diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, seem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <HI>Weeds, Grass,</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> are all laid even, and appear undistinguish'd. I believe too that sometimes our first Thoughts are the best, as the first squeez∣ing of the Grapes makes the finest and richest Wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of Pasto∣ral Comedy, because I think the Taste of our Age will not relish a Poem of that sort. People seek for what they call <HI>Wit,</HI> on all subjects, and in all places; not consi∣dering that Nature loves Truth so well, that it hardly ever admits of flourishing: <HI>Con∣ceit</HI> is to Nature what <HI>Paint</HI> is to Beauty; it is not only needless, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Majesty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintness of Wit: insomuch that the Cri∣tics have excluded it from the loftiest Poet∣ry, as well as the lowest, and forbid it to the Epic no less than the Pastoral. I shou'd certainly displease all those who are charm'd
<PB N="63" REF="208"/>
with <HI>Guarini</HI> and <HI>Bonarelli,</HI> and imitate <HI>Tasso</HI> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <HI>Fable</HI> too. If surpri∣sing shou'd have place in the story of a Pastoral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <HI>Chance</HI> than of <HI>Design;</HI> Intrigue not being very con∣sistent with that Innocence, which ought to constitute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <HI>Aminta</HI> (as I re∣member) but happens by meer accident; unless it be the meeting of <HI>Aminta</HI> with <HI>Syl∣via</HI> at the <HI>Fountain,</HI> which is the contrivance of <HI>Daphne,</HI> and even that is the most simple in the world: The contrary is observable in <HI>Pastor Fido,</HI> where <HI>Corisca</HI> is so perfect a Mistress of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to pass without her. I am inclin'd to think the Pastoral Come∣dy has another disadvantage, as to the <HI>Man∣ners:</HI> Its general design is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, so that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara∣cter must in some measure debase it; and hence it may come to pass, that even the virtuous Characters will not shine so much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra∣ries.—These Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have reason to doubt
<PB N="64" REF="209"/>
them: but I hope your Judgment will set me right.</P>
<P>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an∣other point: It is how far the liberty of <HI>Borrowing</HI> may extend? I have defended it sometimes by saying, that it seems not so much the Perfection of Sense, to say things that have <HI>never</HI> been said before, as to ex∣press those <HI>best</HI> that have been said <HI>oftenest;</HI> and that Writers in the case of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them∣selves wou'd produce only one sort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flourish; but then Poets like Mer∣chants, shou'd repay with something of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de∣sire you to tell me sincerely, if I have not stretch'd this Licence too far in these Pa∣storals? I hope to become a Critic by your Preceps, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have seen your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, so long as you give me leave to profess my self</P>

<P>I Had sooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my Journey to <HI>Windsor;</HI> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en∣gag'd to go to my Corporation of <HI>Rich∣mond</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> I think you are per∣fectly in the right in your Notions of Pastoral, but I am of opinion, that the re∣dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what pleases the common people, is not what ever pleases the best judges. <HI>Pastor Fido</HI> indeed has had more admirers than <HI>Aminta;</HI> but I will venture to say, there is a great deal of difference between the admi∣rers of one and the other. <HI>Corisca,</HI> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pastorl; and <HI>Bo∣narelli</HI>'s fancy of making his Shepherdess in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Borrowing;</HI> 'tis very evident the best <HI>Latin</HI> Poets have extended this very far; and none so far as <HI>Virgil,</HI> who is the best
<PB N="66" REF="211"/>
of them. As for the <HI>Greek</HI> Poets, if we cannot trace them so plainly, 'tis perhaps because we have none before them; 'tis evi∣dent that most of them borrow'd from <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> has been accus'd of burn∣ing those that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be discover'd. The best of the modern Poets in all Languages, are those that have the nearest copied the An∣cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are so obvious (at least if they are natural) that whoever writes last, must write things like what have been said before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat∣ing and drinking, and accuse the Moderns of having stol'n those Inventions from them; it being evident in all such cases, that whoever live first, must first find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q><L>—unus &amp; alter Assuitur pannus,</L></Q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts stol'n, and all the rest is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very foolish figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Antients so mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can distin∣guish the one from the other, I can never
<PB N="67" REF="212"/>
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif∣ferent opinion, and that I have shewn your Verses to some who have made that obje∣ction to them. I have so much Company round me while I write this, and such a noise in my ears, that 'tis impossible I should write any thing but Nonsense, so must break off abruptly. I am, Sir,</P>

<P>AT my return from the North I re∣ceiv'd the favour of your Letter, which had lain there till then. Having been absent about six weeks, I read over your Pastorals again, with a great deal of pleasure, and to judge the better read <HI>Vir∣gil</HI>'s Eclogues, and <HI>Spenser</HI>'s Calendar, at the same time; and I assure you I continue the same opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa∣sions to improve them, 'tis probable you
<PB N="68" REF="213"/>
will make them yet better against Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Verses till he takes away the true Spirit of them; especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great Critics, by me∣chanical Rules, and never enter into the true Design and Genius of an Author. I have seen some of these that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <HI>Horace,</HI> who cry <HI>Virgil</HI> wants fancy, and that <HI>Homer</HI> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com∣mon rate of mortals; but generally they are great admirers of <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Lucan;</HI> and when they write themselves, we find out all the Mystery. They scan their Verses upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the first may be last, or the last first, without any sort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no Design, or Method, or any thing Natural or Just. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings whatsoever (not Poetry only) <HI>Nature</HI> is to be follow'd; and we shou'd be jealous of our selves for being sond of <HI>Similes, Conceits,</HI> and what they call saying <HI>Fine Things.</HI> When we werein the North, my Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> shew'd
<PB N="69" REF="214"/>
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Earl of <HI>P</HI></NOTE>General in <HI>Spain;</HI> I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd, and set to writing here at home, for it was im∣possible that a Man with so much Wit as he shew'd, cou'd be fit to command an Army, or do any other Business. As for what you say of Expression: 'tis indeed the same thing to Wit, as Dress is to Beau∣ty; I have seen many Women over-drest, and several look better in a careless Night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoiselle <HI>Spanheim</HI> drest for a Ball. I do not design to be in <HI>London</HI> till towards the Parliament: then I shall certainly be there; and hope by that time you will have finisht your Pastorals as you would have them appear in the world, and particularly the third of <HI>Autumn</HI> which I have not yet seen. Your last Eclogue be∣ing upon the same Subject as that of mine on Mrs. <HI>Tempest</HI>'s Death, I shou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it were to the Memory of the same Lady, if they were not written for some particular Woman whom you wou'd make immortal. You may take occasion to shew the difference between Poets Mi∣stresses, and other Men's. I only hint this,
<PB N="70" REF="215"/>
which you may either do, or let alone just as you think fit. I shall be very much pleas'd to see you again in Town, and to hear from you in the mean time. I am with very much esteem,</P>

<P>AFter the Thoughts I have already sent you on the subject of <HI>English</HI> Versifi∣cation, you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars. There are indeed cer∣tain Niceties, which tho' not much observed even by correct Versifiers, I cannot but think deserve to be better regarded.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve∣ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may express it so) a Style of Sound. As in de∣scribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers shou'd run easy and slowing: in describing a rough Torrent or Deluge, sonorous and swel∣ling,
<PB N="71" REF="216"/>
and so of the rest. This is evident every where in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> and no where else that I know of to any observable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <HI>Vida.</HI><Q><L>Molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque sonoras.</L>
<L>Immenso cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle sine ictu, Conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape saxa manu, cape robora Pastor,</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite pestem.</L></Q></P>
<P>This, I think, is what very few observe in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder∣ful force in imprinting the image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Ode on St. <HI>Caecilia</HI>'s Day, entitled, <HI>Alexander</HI>'s <HI>Feast.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Every nice Ear, must (I believe) have observ'd, that in any smooth <HI>English</HI> Verse of ten syllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pause</HI> at the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable. It is
<PB N="72" REF="217"/>
upon these the Ear rests, and upon the ju∣dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Versification. For example,</P>
<P>At the fifth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Where-e'er thy Navy ‖ spreads her canvas Wings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the fourth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Homage to thee ‖ and Peace to all she brings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At the sixth. <Q REND="inline"><HI>Like Tracts of Leverets ‖ in Morning Snow.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now I fancy, that to preserve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pauses of the 4th or 6th shou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo∣sition of another; else it will be apt to wea∣ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at least it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite so dead a weight, so tires not so much tho' it be continued longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <HI>Exple∣tives,</HI> whether Words or Syllables, which are made use of purely to supply a vacan∣cy: <HI>Do</HI> before Verbs plural is absolutely such; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the same manner, which are almost always
<PB N="73" REF="218"/>
used for the sake of Rhime. The same Cause has occasioned the promiscuous use of <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> to the same Person, which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would also object to the Irruption of <HI>Alexandrine</HI> Verses of twelve syllables, which I think should never be allow'd but when some remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has been too free of these, especially in his latter Works. I am of the same opinion as to <HI>Triple Rhimes.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. I could equally object to the <HI>Repetition</HI> of the same Rhimes within four or six lines of each other, as tiresome to the Ear thro' their Monotony.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Monosyllable-Lines,</HI> unless very art∣fully managed, are stiff, or languishing: but may be beautiful to express Melancholy, Slowness, or labour.</P>
<P N="7">7. To come to the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> or Gap be∣tween two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other (upon which you desire me to be particular) I think the rule in this case is either to use the <HI>Caesura,</HI> or admit the <HI>Hiatus,</HI> just as the Ear is least
<PB N="74" REF="219"/>
shock'd by either: For the <HI>Caesura</HI> some∣times offends the Ear more than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> itself, and our language is naturally over∣charg'd with Consonants: As for example; If in this Verse,
<Q><L>The Old have Int'rest ever in their Eye,</L></Q>
we should say, to avoid the <HI>Hiatus,</HI>
<Q><L>But th' Old have Int'rest—</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Hiatus</HI> which has the worst effect, is when one word ends with the same Vowel that begins the following; and next to this, those Vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other are most to be avoid∣ed. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know some people will think these Observations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro∣borate them by some great Authorities, which I have met with in <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quin∣tilian.</HI> In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to <HI>Herennius,</HI> are these words: <HI>Fugiemus cre∣bras Vocalium concursiones, quae vastam at∣que hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc est, Baccae aeueae amaenissimae impendebant.</HI> And Quintilian <HI>l.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Vocalium concursus cum accidit, hiat &amp; intersistit, at quasi la∣borat oratio. Pessimi longè quae easdem inter</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="220"/>
<HI>se literas committunt, sonabunt: Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efseruntur. Eplenior litera est, I angu∣slior.</HI> But he goes on to reprove the ex∣cess on the other hand of being too sol∣licitous in this matter, and says admirably, <HI>Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>io an negligentia in hoc, aut solicitudo sit pejor.</HI> So likewise <HI>Tully (Orator ad Brut.) Theopompum reprehendunt, quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, etsi idem magister ejus Isocrates:</HI> which last Author, as <HI>Turnebus</HI> on <HI>Quintilian</HI> observe, has hardly one <HI>Hia∣tus</HI> in all his Works. <HI>Quintilian</HI> tells us that <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Demosthenes</HI> did not much observe this Nicety, tho' <HI>Tully</HI> himself says in his Orator, <HI>Crebra ista Vocum concursio, quam magna ex parte vitiosam, fugit Demosthenes.</HI> If I am not mistaken, <HI>Malherbe</HI> of all the Moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point; and I think <HI>Menage</HI> in his Ob∣servations upon him says, he has not one in his Poems. To conclude, I believe the <HI>Hia∣tus</HI> should be avoided with more care in Poetry than in Oratory; and I would con∣stantly try to prevent it, unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the Sound than the <HI>Hiatus</HI> itself. <HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c. <NOTE PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> died at 49 Years old, in the Year 1708.

<P>I Send you the book of Rudiments of <HI>Drawing,</HI> which you were pleas'd to command, and think my self oblig'd to inform you at the same time of one of the many excellencies you possess without knowing of 'em. You are but too good a Painter already; and no Picture of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s was ever so beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my ac∣quaintance. Indeed it was but just that the
<PB N="77" REF="222"/>
finest lines in nature shou'd be drawn upon the most durable ground, and none cou'd ever be met with that wou'd so readily re∣ceive, or so faithfully retain them, as this Heart. I may boldly say of it that you will not find its fellow in all the <HI>Parts</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> in this book. But I must com∣plain to you of my hand, which is an ar∣rant traitor to my heart; for having been copying your picture from thence and from <HI>Kneller</HI> these three days, it has done all pos∣sible injury to the finest Face that ever was made, and to the liveliest Image that ever was drawn. I have imagination enough in your absence, to trace some resemblance of you; but I have been so long us'd to lose my judgment at the sight of you, that 'tis past my power to correct it by the life. Your Picture seems least like when plac'd before your eyes, and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifest disadvantage by being set in the fairest Light in the world. The Painters are a very vain gene∣ration, and have a long time pretended to rival Nature; but to own the truth to you, she made such a finish'd piece about three and twenty years ago, (I beg your pardon Madam, I protest I meant but two and twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any lon∣ger to contend with her. I know You in∣deed made one something like it, betwixt

five and six years past: 'Twas a little girl, done with abundance of spirit and life; and wants nothing but time to be an ad∣mirable piece: But not to flatter your work, I don't think 'twill ever come up to what your Father made.

<P>IT is too much a rule in this town, that when a Lady has once done a man a favour, he is to be rude to her ever after. It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allow us: By this me∣thod I may write to you most impudent∣ly, because you once answer'd me modest∣ly; and if you shou'd never do me that honour for the future, I am to think (like a true Coxcomb) that your silence gives consent. Perhaps you wonder why this is address'd to you rather than to Mrs. <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> with whom I have the right of an old acquaintance, whereas you are a

fine Lady, have bright eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> First Madam, I make choice of you rather than of your Mother, because you are younger than your Mother. Secondly, because I fancy you spell better, as having been at school later. Thirdly, because you have nothing to do but to write if you please, and possibly it may keep you from em∣ploying your self worse: it may save some honest neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances. Cast your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are seducing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's soften you, and the godly one's give you the spleen: If you look upon trees, they clasp in em∣braces; birds and beasts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yielding and melancholy. Therefore I say once more, cast your eyes upon Paper, and read only such Letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from Innocence of soul, and simplicity of heart. However, I can al∣low you a Bonnet lin'd with green for your eyes, but take care you don't tarnish it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that hand you shade your self with this shining weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with being carried over those Eyes—thank God I am an hundred miles off from them—

Upon the whole I wou'd sooner trust your hand than your Eyes for doing me mis∣chief; and tho' I doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen, yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepar'd, since I may have time while I break open your letter to cross my self and say a <HI>Pater∣noster,</HI> I hope Providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance.

But when Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> sends me word you have the small-pox, a good many freckles, or are very pale, I will desire him to give thanks for it in your Pa∣rish Church, which as soon as he shall inform me he has done I will make you a visit at—without Armour: I will eat any thing you give me without suspi∣cion of poyson, take you by the hand without gloves, nay venture to follow you into an arbour without calling the com∣pany.

<P>THE Wits would say, that this must needs be a dull Letter, because it is a marry'd one. I am afraid indeed you will find what Spirit there is must be on the side of the Wife, and the Husband's part as usual will prove the dullest. What an unequal Pair are put together in this sheet? in which tho' we sin, it is you must do penance. When you look on both sides of this paper, you may fancy that our words (according to a Scripture expression) are as a <HI>Two-edg'd Sword,</HI> whereof Lady <HI>M.</HI> is the shining blade and I only the Handle. But I can't proceed without so far mortifying Sir <HI>Robert</HI> as to tell him, that she writes this purely in obedience to
<PB N="82" REF="227"/>
me, and that it is but one of those honours a Husband receives for the sake of his Wife.</P>
<P>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to shew her the regard we have for another; and yet I must own there is not a period of this Epistle but squints toward another over∣against it. It will be in vain to dissem∣ble: Your penetrating Eyes cannot but disco∣ver how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after Lady <HI>M</HI>'s letters, which seem to bend as much from mine, and fly from them as fast as they are able. Ungrateful letters that they are! which give themselves to another man in the very presence of him who will yield to no mor∣tal in knowing how to value them.</P>
<P>You will think I forget my self, and am not writing to you; but let me tell you, 'tis you forget your self in that thought, for you are almost the only Woman to whom one can safely address the praises of another. Besides can you imagine a Man of my importance so stupid, as to say fine things to you before your Husband? Let us see how far Lady <HI>M.</HI> her self dares do any thing like it, with all the wit and address she is mistress of. If Sir <HI>Robert</HI> can be so ignorant (now he is left to himself in the country) to imagine any such matter, let him know from me, that here in town

<P>IF you have not a chaste ear and a pure heart do not peruse this Letter, for as <HI>Jeremy Taylor</HI> says in his <HI>holy living and dying,</HI> the first thing a Virgin ought to en∣deavour, is to be ignorant of the <HI>distin∣ction</HI> of <HI>Sexes.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the confidence I have that you are thus innocent, that I endeavour to gra∣tify your curiosity in a point in which I am sensible none but a Brother could do it with decency.</P>
<P>I shall entertain you with the most reign∣ing Curiosity in the town, I mean a Person who is equally the toast of gentlemen and ladies, and is at present more universally admired than any of either Sex: You know
<PB N="84" REF="229"/>
few proficients have a greater genius for Monsters than my self; but I never tasted a monster to that degree I have done this creature: It was not, like other monsters, produced in the Desarts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> nor came from the country of the <HI>Great Mo∣gul,</HI> but is the production of the joint-en∣deavours of a <HI>Kentish</HI> Parson and his Spouse, who intended in the singleness of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex, and providence has sent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various opinions concerning this Creature about town, Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> observes that the Age is very licentious, and the present Reign very lewd and cor∣rupt, in permitting a Lady <HI>by Authoriy</HI> (as appears by the printed bills) to expose her personal curiosities for a shilling.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>P.</HI> looks upon it as a Prodigy portending some great Revolution in the State: to strengthen which opinion he produces the following Prophecy of <HI>Nostra∣damus,</HI> which he explains politically.<Q><L>When as two Sexes join'd in One,</L>
<L>Shall in the Realm of <HI>Brute</HI> be shown;</L>
<L>Then Factions shall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choose a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This prodigy of common Gender</L>
<L>Is neither Sex but a Pretender,</L>
<L>So the Lord shield the Faith's Defender.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="230"/>
Mrs. <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> admires what people won∣der at so much? and says she is just so her self: The Duchess of <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> is of the same opinion.</P>
<P>Among these various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Physician and a Divine, the one to inspect the state of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The persons I made choice of were the in∣genious Dr. <HI>P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> and the reverend Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> We were no sooner in the room but the Party came to us drest in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi∣tical imitation of Men—your sharp wit, my dear Sister, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my self look'd first. The Priest you will ma∣liciously fancy was in his nature most an Infidel, and doubted most of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the surest method of believing, seeing and feel∣ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of snuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we should by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by so doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness.</P>

The Doctor upon inspection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at most a natural one: He said upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwise, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a most even disposition, par∣taking of the good qualities of both sexes: for she is neither so inaccessible as other Ladies, nor is he so impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com∣plaisant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that she tells the Gentlemen she has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a La∣dy. As a further proof of this affable dis∣position, he formerly receiv'd visits of the fair sex in their masques, till an imperti∣nent fellow in a female disguise mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</P>

<P>I therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this place; for tho' indeed like most other brothers, I should be sorry you were married at my expence, yet I would by no means, like them, detain you in the country from your admirers, for you may believe me, no brother in the world ever lov'd a sister as I do you.</P>

<P>YOU are to understand, Madam, that my passion for your fair self and your sister, has been divided with the most won∣derful regularity in the world. Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to <HI>Bath</HI> fell out in the three hundred seventy sixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady <HI>Sylvia.</HI> At the
<PB N="88" REF="233"/>
present writing hereof it is the three hun∣dred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your most Serene Majesty, in whose service I was listed some weeks before I beheld your Sister. This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either shall happen to be Queen-Regent at that time.</P>
<P>Pray tell your sister, all the good qua∣lities and virtuous inclinations she has, never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation, as that one vice of her ob∣stinacy will give me mortification this month. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> commands her to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and she refuses! indeed if I were in <HI>Berk∣shire</HI> I should honour her for this obstina∣cy, and magnisy her no less for disobedi∣ence than we do the <HI>Barcelonians.</HI> But people change with the change of places (as we see of late) and virtues become vi∣ces when they cease to be for one's interest, with me, as with others.</P>
<P>Yet let me tell her, she will never look so finely while she is upon earth, as she would here in the water. It is not here as in most other instances, for those Ladies that would please extremely, must go <HI>out</HI> of their own element. She does not make half so good a figure on horseback as <HI>Chri∣stina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but were she once seen in the Bath, no man wou'd part with
<PB N="89" REF="234"/>
her for the best Mermaid in christendom. You know I have seen you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white; I have experienc'd the utmost you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful steps, deserve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and easy behaviour in <HI>Buckram:</HI> Some∣thing between swimming and walking, free enough, and more modestly-half-naked, than you can appear any where else. You have conquer'd enough already by land; show your ambition, and vanquish also by water. We have no pretty Admirals on these Seas, but must strike sails to your white Flags, were they once hoisted up. The Buckram I mention is a dress particu∣larly useful at this time, when we are told the Princess is bringing over the fashion of <HI>German</HI> Ruffs: You ought to use your selves to some degrees of stiffness beforehand. And when our Ladies chins have been tickled a-while with starch'd muslin and wire, they may possibly bear the brush of a <HI>German</HI> beard and whisker.</P>
<P>I cou'd tell you a delightful story of Dr. <HI>P.</HI> but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances. He had heard it was an excellent cure for Love, to kiss the Aunt of the person beloved, who is gene∣rally of years and experience enough to

<P>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I must tell you, so very well, that I question how you and I should agree if we were in a room by our selves? Mrs. <HI>T.</HI> has honestly assured me, that but for some whims which she can't entirely conquer, she would go and see the world with me in man's cloaths. Even you, <HI>Madam,</HI> I fancy (if you wou'd not partake in our adventures) would wait our coming in at the evening with some impatience, and be well enough pleas'd to hear 'em by the fire-side. That would be better than reading Romances, unless Lady <HI>M.</HI> would be our Historian; for as she is married, she has probably lei∣sure hours in the night-time, to write or do what she will in. What raises these desires in me, is an acquaintance I am be∣ginning

with my Lady <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who has all the spirit of the last age, and all the gay experience of a pleasurable life. It were as scandalous an omission to come to the <HI>Bath</HI> and not to see my Lady <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI> as it had formerly been to have tra∣vell'd to <HI>Rome</HI> without visiting the Queen of <HI>Sweeden.</HI> She is, in a word, the best thing this Country has to boast of; and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be, so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be.</P>
<P>I must tell you a truth, which is not however much to my credit. I never thought so must of your self and your sister, as since I have been fourscore miles distance from you. In the Forest I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at <HI>London</HI> as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, goddesses, or what you will. In the same manner I never knew at what a rate I valu'd your life, till you were upon the point of dying. If Mrs. <HI>T.</HI> and you will but fall very sick every season, I shall certainly die for you. Seriously I value you both so much that I esteem others much the less for your sakes; you have robb'd me of the pleasure of esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in them, by showing me so many finer in

I have seen enough of you not to overlook any Frailty you cou'd have, and nothing less than a Vice can make me like you less. I expect you shou'd discover by my con∣duct towards you both, that this is true, and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one dis∣position. Expect nothing from me but truths and freedom, and I shall always be thought by you what I always am,</P>

<P>YOU have ask'd me News a hundred times at the first word you spoke to me, which some would interpret as if you expected nothing better from my lips: And truly 'tis not a sign two Lovers are to∣gether, when they can be so impertinent as to enquire what the world does?

<P>The Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> has behaved so bravely, that in this act at least he might seem above Man, if he had not just now voided a Stone to prove him subject to hu∣man infirmities. The utmost weight of affliction from princely power and popu∣lar hatred, were almost worth bearing, for the glory of such a dauntless conduct as he has shewn under it.</P>

<P>I Will not describe <HI>Bl<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> in particular, not to forestall your expectations before you see it: Only take a short account, which I will hazard my little credit is no unjust one. I never saw so great a thing with so much littleness in it: I think the Architect built it entirely in compliance to the taste of its Owners: For it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable, and the most selfish: it has, like their own hearts, no room for strangers, and no reception for any person of superior quality to them∣selves. There are but two Apartments, for
<PB N="98" REF="243"/>
the Master and Mistress, below; and but two apartments above (very much infe∣rior to them) in the whole House. When you look upon the outside, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you see the inside, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a house of Entries and Passa∣ges; among which there are three Vista's through the whole, very uselessly hand∣some. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but spoil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the sight of several of the windows. There are two ordinary stair-cases instead of one great one. The best things within the house, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the most commodious, and the best contrived of the whole. At the top of the Building are several Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini∣cal and heavy. What seems of the best taste, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with these tur∣rets. The two Sides of the building are intirely spoil'd by two monstrous bow-windows which stand just in the middle, instead of doors: And as if it were fatal
<PB N="99" REF="244"/>
that some trifling littleness should every where destroy the grandeur, there are in the chief front two semicircles of a lower structure than the rest, that cut off the arges, and look as it they were purpose∣ly design'd to hide a lostier and nobler piece of building, the top of which ap∣pears above them. In a word, the whole is a most expensive absurdity; and the Duke of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/></HI> gave a true character of it, when he said, it was a great <HI>Quarry of Stones above ground.</HI></P>

<P>In short, I heard of no Ball, Assembly, Basset-Table, or any place where two or three were gathered together, except Ma∣dam <HI>Kilmansegg</HI>'s, to which I had the honour to be invited, and the grace to stay away.</P>
<P>I was heartily tired, and posted to <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Park; there we had an excellent Discourse of Quackery: Dr. <HI>Shadwell</HI> was mention∣ed with honour.

<P>I cannot be so good a Christian as to be willing (tho' no less than God should or∣der it) to resign my own happiness here for her's in another life. I do more than wish for her safety, for every wish I make I find immediately chang'd into a prayer, and a more fervent one than I had learn'd to make till now.</P>
<P>May her Life be longer and happier than perhaps her self may desire, that is, as long and as happy as your self can wish: May her Beauty be as great as possible, that is, as it always was, or as yours is: but whatever ravages a merciless distem∣per may commit, I dare promise her bold∣ly, what few (if any) of her makers of visits and complements dare to do; she shall have one man as much her admirer as ever. As for your part, Madam, you have me so more than ever, since I have been a witness to the generous tenderness you have shewn upon this occasion.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with infinite satisfaction I am made acquainted that your brother will at last prove your relation, and has en∣tertain'd such sentiments as become him in your concern. I have been prepar'd for this by degrees, having several times receiv'd from Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> that which is one of the greatest pleasures, the knowledge that others enter'd into my own sentiments concerning you. I ever was of opinion that you wanted no more to be vindicated than to be known; and like Truth, cou'd ap∣pear no where but you must conquer. As I have often condol'd with you in your adversities, so I have a right which but few can pretend to, of congratulating on the prospect of your better fortunes; and I hope for the future to have the concern I have felt for you overpaid in your felici∣ties. Tho' you modestly say the world has left you, yet I verily believe it is com∣ing to you again as fast as it can: For to give the world its due, it is always very fond of Merit when 'tis past its power to oppose it. Therefore if you should take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it, you would be so far from
<PB N="110" REF="259"/>
leading what is commonly call'd an un∣settled life (and what you with too much unjust severity call a vagabond Life) that the wise cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progress, who travels to gain the affections he has not, or to fix those he already has; which he effectually does wherever he shews himself. But if you are resolv'd in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it, I be∣lieve your design will be vain; for even in a Monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far towards the next world as to make This lose the sight of you, but you'll be like a Star, that while it is fix'd to Hea∣ven shines over all the Earth.</P>
<P>Wheresoever Providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing I know, I shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes, and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you, when you never hear of me or them. Your own guardian Angels cannot be more constant, nor more silent. I beg you will never cease to think me your friend, that you may not be guilty of that which you never yet knew to commit, an Injustice. As I have hitherto been so in spite of the world, so hereafter, if it be possible you shou'd ever be more opposed, and more deserted, I should on∣ly be so much the more</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>I Can say little to recommend the Let∣ters I shall write to you, but that they will be the most impartial representations of a free heart, and the truest copies you ever saw, tho' of a very mean original. Not a feature will be soften'd, or any ad∣vantageous light employ'd to make the ug∣ly thing a little less hideous: but you shall find it in all respects, most horribly like. You will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing I shall say from this in∣stant, as a compliment, either to you or my self: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to perse∣vere till death in every sentiment or no∣tion I now set down, than you would ima∣gine a man's face should never change when once his picture was drawn.</P>
<P>The freedom I shall use in this manner of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools, the honest ones. And since what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in spight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at
<PB N="112" REF="261"/>
all, and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends. If <HI>Momus</HI>'s project had taken, of having windows in our breasts, I shou'd be for carrying it further, and making those windows; casements; that while a man show'd his heart to all the world, he might do something more for his friends, even give it them, and trust it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King <HI>Herod</HI> did <HI>Herodias</HI> (tho' I never had so much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a dish, as he did another's head. But since <HI>Jupiter</HI> will not have it so, I must be con∣tent to shew my taste in life, as I do my taste in painting, by loving to have as little drapery as possible. Not that I think every body naked altogether so fine a sight as your self and a few more would be; but because 'tis good to use people to what they must be acquainted with; and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other, to uncover every soul of us. We shall then see that the <HI>Prues</HI> of this world ow'd all their fine figure only to their be∣ing strater-lac'd than the rest; and that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as those that never girded their loins at all.—But a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more free∣ly to me, is, that I am confident no one
<PB N="113" REF="262"/>
knows you better: for I find, when o∣thers express their thoughts of you, they fall very short of mine, and I know at the same time theirs are such as you would think sufficient in your favour.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine how desirous I must be of a correspondence with a person, who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight, as to love: and who has since ruin'd me for all the conversation of one sex, and almost all the friendship of the other. I am but too sensible, thro' your means, that the com∣pany of men wants a certain softness to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing else. How often have I been quietly going to take possession of that tranquillity and indolence I had so long found in the country; when one evening of your conversation has spoil'd me for a <HI>Soli∣taire!</HI> Books have lost their effect upon me, and I was convinced, since I saw you, that there is one alive wiser than all the Sages: a plague of female wisdom! it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own. What is very strange, Virtue herself (when you have the dressing her) is too amiable for one's repose. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have seen you to have conversed with you; they
<PB N="114" REF="263"/>
would have been strangely bit, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair La∣dy, and you had bewitch'd them with Reason and Virtue (two Beauties that the very Fops pretend to have no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy distance at which we cor∣respond, removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth, to save good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blush; we converse upon such unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, shame, or de∣sign, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impose (even in a single thought) upon each other in this state of separation, as for Spirits of a different sphere who have so little inter∣course with us, to employ that little (as some would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a question, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most instances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the last hour I saw you? What degree of concern did I discover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will
<PB N="115" REF="264"/>
never feel, that of parting from what one most esteems? for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever decency made.</P>
<P>I never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon seeing the Tomb of a friend, which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost. I reflect upon the circumstances of your departure, which I was there a wit∣ness of (your behaviour in what I may call your last moments) and I indulge a gloo∣my kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were given to me. I would fain imagine this was not accidental, but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have, in finding out the truth of people's sentiments; and that you were willing, the last man that <HI>would have</HI> par∣ted from you, should be that last that <HI>did.</HI> I really look'd upon you just as the friends of <HI>Curtius</HI> might have done upon that Hero, at the instant when he was devoting him∣self to Glory, and running to be lost out of generosity. I was obliged to admire your resolution, in as great a degree as I de∣plored it; and had only to wish, that Hea∣ven would reward so much Virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could enjoy elsewhere!</P>

<P>YOU will find me more troublesome than ever <HI>Brutus</HI> did his Evil Genius; I shall meet you in more places than one, and often refresh your memory before you arrive at your <HI>Philippi.</HI> These shadows of me (my letters) will be haunting you from time to time, and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffer'd very much from you, and whom you have robb'd of the most valuable of his enjoy∣ments, your conversation. The advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the risque I generally run of manifesting my own indiscretion. You then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given, for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute you answer'd. I must now be contented with more slow re∣turns. However 'tis some pleasure, that your thoughts upon Paper will be a more lasting possession to me, and that I shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss I have so often regretted, that of any
<PB N="117" REF="266"/>
thing you said, which I happen'd to forget. In earnest, Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it must be every day of my life. I attend you in spirit through all your ways, I fol∣low you thro' every stage in books of tra∣vels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead travellers; and if I read of a delight∣ful prospect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet subsists to please you. I enquire the roads, the amusements, the company, of every town and country thro' which you pass, with as much diligence, as if I were to set out next week to overtake you. In a word, no one can have you more constantly in mind, not even your guar∣dian Angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge so much Popery, as to fancy some Being takes care of you who knows your value better than you do your self: I am willing to think that Heaven never gave so much self-neglect and resolution to a woman, to occasion her calamity, but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to con∣duce to her benefit and her glory.</P>
<P>Your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the first Dove that return'd to
<PB N="118" REF="267"/>
<HI>Noah,</HI> and just made him know it had found no rest abroad.</P>
<P>There is nothing in it that pleases me, but when you tell me you had no Sea-sickness. I beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no discoveries that will be half so valuable to me as those of your own mind; Nothing that regards the States or Kingdoms you pass through, will engage so much of my curiosity or concern, as what relates to your∣self: Your welfare, to say truth, is more at my heart than that of <HI>Christen∣dom.</HI></P>
<P>I am sure I may defend the truth, though perhaps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubt∣ful at best, of the merits of differing religions and governments: but private virtues one can be sure of. I there∣fore know what particular person has desert enough to merit being happier than others, but not what nation de∣serves to conquer or oppress another. You will say, I am not <HI>Publick-spiri∣ted;</HI> let it be so, I may have too ma∣ny tendernesses, particularly regards, or narrow views; but at the same time I am certain that whoever wants these,
<PB N="119" REF="268"/>
can never have a <HI>Publick-spirit;</HI> for (as a friend of mine says) how is it possible for that man to love twen∣ty thousand people, who never loved one?</P>
<P>I communicated your letter to Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought, I mean as I do, and one always thinks that to be just as it ought. His health and mine are now so good, that we wish, with all our souls, you were a witness of it. We never meet but we lament over you: we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory, where we strow flow∣ers of rhetorick, and offer such liba∣tions to your name as it would be pro∣phane to call <HI>Toasting.</HI> The Duke of <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>m</HI> is sometimes the High Priest of your praises; and upon the whole, I believe there are as few Men that are not sorry at your departure, as Wo∣men that are; for you know most of your Sex want good sense, and there∣fore must want generosity: You have so much of both, that I am sure you pardon them; for one cannot but for∣give whatever one despises For my part I hate a great many women for your sake; and undervalue all the rest. 'Tis you are to blame, and may God revenge it upon you, with all

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had pleas'd myself sooner in writing to you, but that I have been your Suc∣cessor in a Fit of Sickness, and am not yet so much recovered, but that I have thoughts of using your <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Asses.</NOTE>Physicians. They are as grave Persons as any of the Faculty, and (like the Antients) carry their own Medicaments about with them. But in∣deed the Moderns are such Lovers of Rail∣lery, that nothing is grave enough to escape them. Let 'em laugh, but People will still have their Opinions: As they think our Doctors Asses to them, we'll think them Asses to our Doctors.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="271"/>
I am glad you are so much in a better State of Health, as to follow me to jest about it. My Concern, when I heard of your Danger, was so very serious, that I almost take it ill Dr. <HI>Evans</HI> should tell you of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly, if you and a few more such people were to leave the World, I would not give Six∣pence to stay in it.</P>
<P>I am not so much concern'd as to the point, whether you are to live fat or lean: Most Men of Wit or Honesty are usually decreed to live very lean; so I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you shall: However be comforted, and reflect that you'll make the better Busto for it.</P>
<P>'Tis something particular in you, not to be satisfied with sending me your own Books, but to make your Acquaintance continue the Frolick. Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> forc'd me to take <HI>Gorboduc,</HI> which has since done me great Credit with several People, as it has done <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Oldham</HI> some Dis∣kindness, in shewing there is as much dif∣ference between their <HI>Gorboduc,</HI> and this, as between Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and King <HI>George.</HI> It is truly a Scandal, that Men should write with Contempt of a Piece which they never once saw, as those two Poets did, who were ignorant even of the Sex, as well as Sense, of <HI>Gorboduc.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO convince you how little pain I give myself, in corresponding with Men of good Nature, and good Under∣standing, you see I omit to answer your Letters till a time, when another Man would be ashamed to own he had received

If therefore you are ever moved on my Account by that Spirit, which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague, I mean the Spirit of Goodness, pray never stint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Civility beyond my natural Inclina∣tion: I dare trust you, Sir, not only with my Folly when I write, but with my Neg∣ligence when I do not; and expect equally your Pardon for either.</P>
<P>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the rest of this Paper, it should be spotted and diversified with Conceits all over; you should be put out of Breath with Laughter at each Sentence, and pause at each Period, to look back over how much Wit you had pass'd. But I have found by Experience, that People now a-days regard Writing as little as they do Preaching: The most we can hope is to be heard, just with Decency and Patience, once a Week, by Folks in the Country: Here in Town we hum over a Piece of fine Writing, and we whistle at a Sermon. The Stage is the only Place we seem alive at; there indeed we stare, and roar, and clap Hands for K. <HI>George</HI> and the Government. As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty, they are an obsolete Train, so ill-dress'd, that Men, Women, and Chil∣dren, hiss 'em out of all good Company. Humility knocks so sneakingly at the Door,
<PB N="125" REF="274"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride, Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> from having rusti∣cated in your Company too long, really behaves herself scandalously among us: She pretends to open her Eyes for the Sake of seeing the Sun, and to sleep because it is Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn∣ing, and is thought to have said her Prayers before; talks without any manner of Shame of good Books, and has not seen <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Play of the <HI>Non-juror.</HI> I rejoiced the other Day to see a Libel on her Toilette, which gives me some Hope that you have at least a Taste of Scandal left you, in Defect of all other Vices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole Matter, I heartily wish you well; but as I cannot entirely desire the Ruin of all the Joys of this City, so all that remains is to wish you wou'd keep your Happiness to your selves, that the happiest here may not die with Envy at a Bliss which they cannot attain to.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU'LL think me very full of my self, when after a long Silence (which
<PB N="126" REF="275"/>
however to say Truth has rather been em∣ploy'd to contemplate of you, than to for∣get you) I begin to talk of my own Works. I find it is in the finishing a Book, as in concluding a Session of Parliament, one al∣ways thinks it will be very soon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd for Incidents to retard the clearing <HI>any publick Account,</HI> and so I see it is in mine. I have plagued myself, like great Ministers, with undertaking too much for one Man, and with a Desire of doing more than was ex∣pected from me, have done less than I ought.</P>
<P>For having design'd four very laborious and uncommon sorts of Indexes to <HI>Homer,</HI> I'm forc'd, for want of Time, to publish two only; the Design of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully executed. I've also been oblig'd to leave unfinish'd in my Desk the Heads of two Essays, one on the <HI>Theology</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and another on the <HI>Oratory</HI> of <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> So they must wait for fu∣ture Editions, or perish; and (one Way or other, no great Matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI></P>
<P>I think of you every Day, I assure you, even without such good Memorials of you as your Sisters, with whom I sometimes talk of you, and find it one of the most agree∣able of all Subjects to them. My Lord
<PB N="127" REF="276"/>
<HI>Digby</HI> must be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil∣dren. There needs no more than an Ac∣quaintance with your Family, to make all Elder Sons wish they had Fathers to their Lives-end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the Subject of filial Love, without putting you in mind of an old Woman, who has a sincere, hearty, old-fashion'd Respect for you, and con∣stantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner, to tell you so.</P>
<P>I very much wish (but what signifies my wishing? my Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> wishes, your Sister's wish) that you were with us, to com∣pare the beautiful Contrast this Season af∣fords us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what <HI>Twickenham</HI> is (and what your Friend Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> of <HI>Twickenham</HI> is) in this warmer Season. Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun, at the same time that its Banks re∣tain the Verdure of Showers: Our Gardens are offering their first Nosegays; our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought happily together, are stretching their Arms to meet each other, and growing nearer and nearer every Hour: The Birds are paying their thanksgiving Songs for the new Habita∣tions I have made 'em: My Building rites
<PB N="128" REF="277"/>
high enough to attract the Eye and Curi∣osity of the Passenger from the River, where, upon beholding a Mixture of Beauty and Ruin, he enquires what House is falling, or what Church is rising? So little taste have our common Tritons of <HI>Vitruvius;</HI> whatever Delight the true, unseen, poeti∣cal Gods of the River may take, in re∣flecting on their Streams my <HI>Tuscan</HI> Porti∣cos, or <HI>Ionic</HI> Pilasters.</P>
<P>But (to descend from all this Pomp of Style) the best Account I can give of what I am building, is, that it will afford me a few pleasant Rooms for such a Friend as yourself, or a cool Situation for an Hour or two for Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> when she will do me the Honour (at this Publick House on the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</P>
<P>The Moment I am writing this, I am surprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talking of, a meer Jest! Build∣ings, Gardens, Writings, Pleasures, Works, of whatever stuff Man can raise! none of them (God knows) capable of advanta∣ging a Creature that is mortal, or of satis∣fying a Soul that is immortal!

<P>I Have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family, to think you will all be pleas'd that I am arriv'd in saftey at <HI>Twickenham;</HI> tho' 'tis a sort of Earnest, that you will be troubled again with me at <HI>Sher∣borne,</HI> or <HI>Coleshill;</HI> for however I may like One of your places, it may be in that as in liking One of your family; when one secs the rest, one likes them all. Pray make my services acceptable to them; I wish them all the happiness they may want, and the con∣tinuance of all the happiness they have; and I take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former. I must separate Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> from you, as I fear she will do herself, before this letter reaches you: So I wish her a good journey, and I hope one day to try if she lives as well as you do; tho' I much question if she can live as quiet∣ly: I suspect the Bells will be ringing at her arrival, and on her own and Miss <HI>Scudamore</HI>'s birthdays, and that all the Clergy in the County come to pay respects; both the Cler∣gy and their Bells expecting from her. and

Besides all this, there dwells on the one side of her the Lord <HI>Coningsby,</HI> and on the other Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Yet I shall, when the Days and the Years come about, adventure upon all this for her sake.</P>
<P>I beg my Lord <HI>Digby</HI> to think me a bet∣ter Man than to content myself with thank∣ing him in the common way. I am in as sincere a sense of the word, His Servant, as you are his Son, or he your Father.</P>
<P>I must in my turn insist upon hearing how my last fellow-travellers got home from <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and desire Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> to re∣member me in his Cyder, and to tell Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> that I am dead and buried.</P>

<P>YOUR making a sort of Apology for your not writing, is a very genteel reproof to me. I know I was to blame, but I know I did not intend to be so, and (what is the happiest Knowledge in the World) I know you will forgive me: For sure nothing is more satisfactory than to be certain of such a Friend as will over∣look one's Failings, since every such in∣stance is a Conviction of his Kindness.</P>
<P>If I am all my life to dwell in Inten∣tions, and never to rise to Actions, I have but too much need of that gentle disposi∣tion which I experience in you. But I hope better things of myself, and fully purpose to make you a visit this summer at <HI>Sher∣bourn.</HI> I'm told you are all upon removal very speedily, and that Mrs. <HI>Mary Digly</HI> talks in a Letter to Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> of seeing my Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI>'s Wood in her way. How much I wish to be her Guide thro' that enchanted Forest, is not to be exprest: I look upon myself as the Ma∣gician appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the Recesses of those sacred Shades. I could pass whole Days, in only describing to
<PB N="136" REF="285"/>
her the future, and as yet visionary Beau∣ties, that are to rise in those Scenes: The Palace that is to be built, the Pa∣villions that are to glitter, the Colonnades that are to adorn them: Nay more, the meeting of the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Severn,</HI> which (when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' secret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till they rise and openly celebrate their Mar∣riage in the midst of an immense Amphi∣theatre, which is to be the Admiration of Posterity a hundred Years hence. But till the destin'd time shall arrive that is to manifest these Wonders, Mrs. <HI>Digly</HI> must content herself with seeing what is at present no more than the finest Wood in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different Na∣ture. Women of Quality are all turn'd Followers of the <HI>Camp</HI> in <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> this Year, whither all the Town resort to magnificent Entertainments given by the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Seythian</HI> Ladies that dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not more closely attached to the Luggage. The Matrons, like those of <HI>Sparta,</HI> attend their Sons to the Field, to be the Witnesses of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens
<PB N="137" REF="286"/>
with all their Charms display'd, provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee supply the place of <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> black Broth. This camp seems crowded with perpetual Victory, for every Sun that rises in the Thunder of Cannon, sets in the Musick of Violins. Nothing is yet want∣ing but the constant presence of the <HI>Prin∣cess,</HI> to represent the <HI>Mater Exercitus.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Twickenham</HI> the World goes other∣wise. There are certain old People who take up all my time, and will hardly allow me to keep any other Company. They were introduced here by a Man of their own sort, who has made me perfectly rude to all my Contemporaries, and won't so much as suffer me to look upon 'em. The Person I complain of is the Bishop of <HI>Ro∣chester.</HI> Yet he allows me (form some∣thing he has heard of your Character and that of your Family, as if you were of the old Sect of Moralists) to write three or four sides of Paper to you, and to tell you (what these sort of People never tell but with Truth, and religious Sincerity) that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<P>THE same reason that hinder'd your writing, hinder'd mine, the pleasing Expectation to see you in Town. Indeed since the willing Confinement I have lain under here with my Mother, (whom it is natural and reasonable I should rejoice with as well as grieve) I could the better bear your Absense from <HI>London,</HI> for I could hardly have seen you there; and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick Room hither from the first Embraces of your Friends. My Mother is now (I thank God) wondersully recovered, tho' not so much as yet to ven∣ture out of her Chamber, yet enough to enjoy a few particular Friends, when they have the good Nature to look upon her. I may recommend to you the Room we sit in, upon one (and that a favourite) Ac∣count, that it is the very <HI>warmest</HI> in the House: We and our Fires will equally smile upon your Face, There is a <HI>Persian</HI> Proverb that says, I think very prettily, <HI>The Conversation of a Friend brightens the</HI>

<HI>Eyes.</HI> This I take to be a Splendor still more agreeable than the Fires you so de∣lightfully describe.</P>
<P>That you may long enjoy your own Fire-side, in the metaphorical Sense, that is, all those of your Family who make it pleasing to sit and spend whole wintry Months together, (a far more rational Delight, and better selt by an honest Heart than all the glaring Entertainments, nu∣merous Lights and false Splendors, of an <HI>Assembly</HI> of empty Heads, aking Hearts, and false Faces) This is my sincere Wish to you and yours.</P>
<P>You say you propose much Pleasure in seeing some few <HI>Faces</HI> about Town of my Acquaintance, I guess you mean Mrs. <HI>Howara</HI>'s and Mrs. <HI>Blount</HI>'s.

<P>A Fever carry'd me on the high Gallop towards it for six or seven days—But here you have me now, and that's all I shall say of it: Since which time an impertinent Lameness kept me at home twice as long; as if Fate should say (after the other dan∣gerons Illness) <Q REND="inline">"You shall neither go into the other World, nor any where you like in this."</Q> Else who knows but I had been at <HI>Hom-lacy?</HI></P>

<P>I Have been above a month strolling about in <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> and <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> from Garden to Garden, but still returning to Lord <HI>Cobham</HI>'s with fresh Satisfaction. I should be sorry to see my Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI>'s, till it has had the full Advantage of Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI>'s Improvements; and then I will expect something like the waters of <HI>Riskins,</HI> and the woods of <HI>Oakley</HI> together, which (without flattery) would be at least as good as any thing in our World: For as to the

(what makes him still more a Child) a King of <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> My own time has been more melancholy, spent in an Attendance upon Death, which has seized one of our Family, my poor old Nurse. My Mother is something better, though at her advanc'd Age every Day is a Climacteric. There was join'd to this an Indisposition of my own, which I ought to look upon as a slight one, compar'd with my Mother's (because my Life is not of half the Consequence to any Body, that her's is to me). All these Inci∣dents have hinder'd my more speedy Reply to your obliging Letter.</P>
<P>The Article you enquire of, is of as little Concern to me as you desire it shou'd; namely the Railing Papers about the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> If the Book has Merit, (and since you like it, it must) it will extinguish all such nasty Scandal, as the Sun puts an end to stinks, meerly by <HI>coming out.</HI></P>
<P>I wish I had nothing to trouble me more; an honest Mind is not in the power of any dishonest one: To break it's Peace, there must be some Guilt or Consciousness, which is inconsistent with it's own Principles. Not but Malice and Injustice have their Day, like some poor short-liv'd Vermine, that die of shooting their own Stings. <HI>Falshood is Folly</HI> (says <HI>Homer</HI>), and Liars and Calumni∣ators at last hurt none but themselves, even

in this World: In the next, 'tis Charity to say, God have Mercy on them! They were the Devil's Vice-gerents upon Earth, who is the Father of Lies, and I fear has a Right to dispose of his Children.</P>
<P>I've had an Occasion to make these Re∣flexions of late, more justly than from any thing that concerns my Writings, for it is one that concerns my Morals, and (which I ought to be as tender of as my own) the good Character of another very innocent Person, who I'm sure shares your Friendship no less than I do. ***** No Creature has better natural Dispositions, or would act more rightly, or reasonably, in every Duty, did she act by herself, or from herself: But you know it is the Misfortune of that Fa∣mily to be governed like a Ship, I mean the Head guided by the Tail, and that by every Wind that blows in it.</P>

<P>IT is now the Season to wish you a good End of one Year, and a happy Beginning of another: but both these you know how to make yourself, by only continuing such
<PB N="148" REF="297"/>
a Life as you have been long accustomed to lead. As for Good Works, they are things I dare not name, either to those that do them, or to those that do them not; the first are too modest, and the latter too selfish, to bear the mention of what are become either too old fashion'd or too private, to consti∣tute any Part of the Vanity or Reputation of the present Age. However, it were to be wish'd People would now and then look upon Good Works as they do upon old Wardrobes, meerly in case any of 'em should by chance come into Fashion again; as an∣cient Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd Petticoats (which may be properly compar'd to Charities, as they cover a Multitude of Sins).</P>
<P>They tell me that at <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> certain anti∣quated Charities, and obsolete Devotions are yet subsisting: That a thing called Christian Chearfulness (not incompatible with <HI>Christ∣mas</HI> Pyes and Plumb-broth) whereof frequent is the mention in old Sermons and Alma∣nacks, is really kept alive and in Practice: That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good House-keeping, in a Latitude not more re∣mote from <HI>London</HI> than fourscore Miles: And lastly, that Prayers and Roast-beef actually make some People as happy, as a Whore and a Bottle. But here in Town
<PB N="149" REF="298"/>
I assure you, Men, Women, and Children, I have done with these things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home. Instead of the four Cardinal Virtues, now reign four Princely ones: We have Cunning for Pru∣dence, Rapine for Justice, Time-serving for Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance. Whatever you may fancy where you live in a State of Ignorance, and see nothing but Quiet, Religion, and Good Humour, the Case is just as I tell you where People under∣stand the World, and know how to live with Credit and Glory.</P>
<P>I wish that Heaven would open the Eyes of Men, and make 'em sensible <HI>which</HI> of these is right: Whether upon a due Conviction, we are to quit Faction, and Gaming, and High-feeding and Whoring, and take to your Country Way? or you to leave Prayers, and Almsgiving, and Read∣ing and Exercise, and come into our Mea∣sures?

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Know of nothing that will be so Inte∣ressing to you at present, as some cir∣cumstances of the last Act of that eminent Comic Poet, and our Friend, <HI>Wycherley.</HI> He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would marry as soon as his life was despair'd of. Accord∣ingly a few days before his Death he un∣derwent the Ceremony; and join'd together those two Sacraments which wise Men say should be the last we receive; for if you ob∣serve, Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<PB N="151" REF="300"/>
Unction in our Catechism, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken. The old Man then lay down, satisfy'd in the Conscience of having, by this one Act paid his just Debts, obliged a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and shewn a heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, discharg∣ed those Debts; a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompence; and the Nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could, with the miserable Remains of a mortgaged Estate. I saw our Friend twice after this was done, less peevish in his Sickness than he used to be in his Health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been more likely) much ashamed of marrying. The Evening before he ex∣pired, he called his young Wife to the bed∣side, and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request, the last he should make. Upon her Assurances of consenting to it, he told her, <HI>My Dear, it is only this; that you will never marry an old Man again.</HI> I can∣not help remarking, that Sickness which often destroys both Wit and Wisdom, yet seldom has power to remove that Talent which we call <HI>Humour:</HI> Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI> shew'd his, even in this last Compliment; tho' I think his request a little hard; for
<PB N="152" REF="301"/>
why should he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the same easy Terms?</P>
<P>So trivial as these Circumstances are, I should not be displeas'd myself to know such Trifles, when they concern or chara∣cterise any eminent Person. The wisest and wittiest of Men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these sober Moments. At least, our Friend ended much in the Character he had lived in: And <HI>Horace</HI>'s Rule for a Play, may as well be apply'd to him as a Playwright.<Q><L>—servetur ad imum</L>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM just return'd from the Country, whither Mr <HI>Rowe</HI> accompanied me, and pass'd a Week in the Forest. I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me; but I must acquaint you there is a Vi∣vacity and Gaiety of Disposition almost pe∣culiar to him, which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which
<PB N="153" REF="302"/>
generally succeeds all our pleasures. I have been just taking a solitary walk by moon∣shine, full of reflections on the transitory na∣ture of all human delights; and giving my Thoughts a loose in the contemplation of those Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the Company of separate Spirits, when we shall range the walks a∣bove, and perhaps gaze on this World at as vast a distance as we now do on those Worlds. The pleasures we are to enjoy in that Conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro∣ceed from the Discoveries each shall commu∣nicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the Happiness of Minds can surely be nothing but Knowledge.</P>
<P>The highest Gratification we receive from Company is <HI>Mirth,</HI> which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that beats about the breast for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty.</P>
<P>Keeping good Company, even the best, is but a less shameful Art of losing Time</P>
<P>What we here call <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> are little better: The greater number of Arts to which we apply ourselves are mere grop∣ing in the Dark; and even the search of our most important Concerns in a future being, is but a needless, anxious, and uncertain haste to be knowing, sooner than we can,
<PB N="154" REF="303"/>
what without all this sollicitude we shall know a little later. We are but <HI>Curious Impertinents</HI> in the case of Futurity. 'Tis not our business to be guessing what the State of Souls shall be, but to be doing what may make our own State happy; We cannot be Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science, Divinity; you will be so civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stress up∣on the rest. Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other use, than Horses of the Bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they toss their Heads as if they were proud of 'em) only to jogg on a little more merrily.</P>
<P>Your Observations on the narrow concep∣tions of Mankind in the point of Friend∣ship, confirm me in what I was so fortu∣nate as at my first knowledge of you to hope, and since so amply to experience. Let me take so much decent Pride and Dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini∣ons like these, which I discover'd in your Mind, I had never made the Trial I have done; which has succeeded so much to mine, and I believe not less to your Satisfaction: For if I know you right, your Pleasure is greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="304"/>
Your Remark, that the Variety of opini∣on in Politics or Religion is often rather a Gratification than Objection, to people who have Sense enough to consider the beau∣tiful order of Nature in her Variations; makes me think you have not construed <HI>Joannes Secundus</HI> wrong, in the Verse which precedes that which you quote; <HI>Bene nota Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way signify the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Religion, tho' <HI>Secundus</HI> was of it. I think it was generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him, which divided the whole World. I am pretty sure You and I should no more make good <HI>Inquisitors</HI> to the mo∣dern Tyrants in Faith, than we could have been qualify'd for <HI>Lictors</HI> to <HI>Procrustes,</HI> when he converted refractory Members with the Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you what I think I have formerly said; that I as little fear God will damn a Man who has Charity, as I hope that any Priest can save him without it.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find that a real Concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing too: The more time we give our selves to think over one's own, or a Friend's unhappi∣ness, the more unable we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a Letter, at such a Season as this, as to retard a melancholy Visit to a Person one cannot relieve. One is ashamed in that Circumstance, to pretend to entertain peo∣ple with trifling, insignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand, or unseasonable and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things sacred; to treat so solemn a matter as a generous vo∣luntary Suffering, with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as your's has no need of being spirited up into Honour, or like a weak Woman, praised into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis enough to do and suffer what we ought; and Men should know, that the noble pow∣er of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemish'd Conscience and inflexible Resolution are
<PB N="162" REF="306"/>
above an accidental Flow of Spirits, or a sud∣den Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious Business of Mankind be included in Resigna∣tion to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel∣low-Creatures; there are now some People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practising the one, as themselves have given an infamous Instance of the Violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has always this Comfort when he is opprest, that he knows himself to be superior to those who injure him: For the greatest Power on Earth can no sooner do him that Injury, but the brave Man can make himself greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to seek for allevia∣ting Consolations in a Calamity of so much Glory, one might say that to be ruin'd thus in the Gross, with a whole People, is but like perishing in the General Conflagration, where nothing we can value is left behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks in our present Condition, the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's Load, and (opprest as we are) to succour such as are yet more opprest. If there are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give, our Money; there are yet others who may be relieved by our Coun∣sel, by our Countenance, and even by our
<PB N="163" REF="307"/>
Chearfulness. The Misfortunes of private Families, the Misunderstandings of People whom Distresses make suspicious, the Cold∣nesses of Relations whom Change of Reli∣gion may dis unite, or the Necessities of half∣ruin'd Estates render unkind to each other; these at least may be soften'd in some de∣grees, by a general well-manag'd Humanity among ourselves, if all those who have your Principles of Belief, had also your Sense and Conduct. But indeed most of 'em have given lamentable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <HI>Preston.</HI></NOTE> proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Sense, are only religious thro' Weakness, and good-natur'd thro' Shame: These are narrow-minded Creatures that never deal in Essentials; their Faith never looks be∣yond Ceremonials, nor their Charity be∣yond Relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any distressed, conscientious <HI>French</HI> Refugee at this instant: what must my Concern then be, when I perceive so many Anxieties now tearing those Hearts which I have desired a place in, and Clouds of Melancholy rising on those Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection? I begin already to feel both what some ap∣prehend, and what others are yet too stu∣pid
<PB N="164" REF="308"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old, for so many additional Inconveniences, and Chagrins, more than their small Remain of Life seem'd destin'd to undergo; and with the Young, for so many of those Gayeties and Pleasures (the Portion of Youth) which they will by this means be depriv'd of. This brings into my mind one or other of those I love best, and among them the Wi∣dow and Fatherless, late of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> As I am certain no People living had an earlier and truer Sense of others Misfortunes, or a more generous Resignation as to what might be their own; so I earnestly wish, that what∣ever part they must bear may be render'd as supportable to them, as it is in the power of any Friend to make it.</P>
<P>But I know you have prevented me in this Thought, as you always will in any thing that's good, or generous: I find by a Letter of your Lady's (which I have seen) that their Ease and Tranquility is part of your Care. I believe there's some Fatality in it, that you should always, from time to time, be doing those particular things that make me enamour'd of you.</P>
<P>I write this from <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest, of which I am come to take my last look. We here bid our Neighbours adieu, much as those who go to be hang'd do their Fellow-Prisoners, who are condemn'd to follow
<PB N="165" REF="309"/>
them a few weeks after. I parted from honest Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> with tenderness; and from old Sir <HI>William Trumball</HI> as from a venerable Prophet, foretelling with lifted hands the Miseries to come, from which he is just going to be remov'd himself.</P>
<P>Perhaps, now I have learnt so far as
<Q><L>—Nos Dulcia linquimus arva,</L></Q>
My next Lesson may be
<Q><L>Nos Patriam fugimus—</L></Q></P>
<P>Let that, and all else be as Heaven pleases! I have provided just enough to keep me a Man of Honour. I believe you and I shall never be asham'd of each other. I know I wish my Country well; and if it undoes me, it shall not make me wish it other∣wise.</P>

<P>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private Affairs may plead a lawful Excuse in behalf of a negligent Correspondent, I have really a very good Title to it: I cannot say
<PB N="166" REF="310"/>
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappiness, that I am obliged at this time to give up my whole Application to <HI>Homer;</HI> when with∣out that Employment, my Thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable, the Vio∣lence, Madness and Resentment of modern War-makers, which are likely to prove (to some People at least) more fatal, than the same Qualities in <HI>Achilles</HI> did to his unfor∣tunate Countrymen.</P>
<P>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life, from <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest to the Side of the <HI>Thames,</HI> be one of the grand <HI>Aera's</HI> of my days, and may be called a notable Period in so inconsiderable a History; yet you can scarce imagine any Hero passing from one Stage of Life to another, with so much Tranquillity, so easy a Transition, and so laudable a Behaviour. I am become so tru∣ly a Citizen of the World (according to <HI>Plato</HI>'s Expression) that I look with equal Indifference on what I have lost, and on what I have gained. The Times and A∣musements past are not more like a Dream to me, than those which are present: I lie in a refreshing kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort at least from Obscurity, that the <HI>Darkness</HI> helps me to <HI>sleep</HI> the better. I now and then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my Friends, whom I fancy I remember much as separate Spirits do us, at tender
<PB N="167" REF="311"/>
Intervals, neither interrupting their own Employments, nor altogether careless of ours: but in general constantly wishing us well, and hoping to have us one day in their Company.</P>
<P>To grow indifferent to the World is to grow Philosophical, or Religious; (which∣soever of those Turns we chance to take) and indeed the World is such a thing as one that thinks pretty much, must either laugh at, or be angry with: But if we laugh at it, they say we are proud; and if we are angry with it, they say we are ill-natur'd. So the most politic Way is to seem always better pleas'd than one can be, greater Ad∣mirers, greater Lovers, and in short greater Fools, than we really are: So shall we live comfortably with our Families, quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd by our Masters, and happy with our Mistresses.

well in it: And I hope you have received your Reward, in being happy where you are. I believe, in the Religious Country you now inhabit, you'll be better pleas'd to find I consider you in this light, than if I compared you to those <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> whose Constancy in suffering Pain, and whose Resolution in pursuit of a generous End, you would rather imitate than boast of.</P>
<P>But I had a melancholy hint the other day, as if you were yet a Martyr to the fa∣tigue your Virtue made you undergo on this side the Water. I beg if your health be restor'd to you, not to deny me the Joy of knowing it: Your endeavours of Service and good Advices to the poor Papists, put me in mind of <HI>Noah's</HI> preaching forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last.

<P>If I durst mix prophane with sacred History, I would chear you with the old Tale of <HI>Brutus</HI> the wandering <HI>Trojan,</HI> who found on that very Coast the happy End of his Peregrinations and Adventures.</P>
<P>I have very lately read <HI>Jeffery</HI> of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> (to whom your <HI>Cornwall</HI> is not a lit∣tle beholden) in the Translation of a Cler∣gyman
<PB N="169" REF="313"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is highly concerned to vindicate <HI>Jef∣fery</HI>'s veracity as an Historian; and tole me he was perfectly astonished, we of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Communion could doubt of the Le∣gends of his Giants, while we believ'd those of our Saints? I am forced to make a fair Composition with him; and, by crediting some of the Wonders of <HI>Corinaeus</HI> and <HI>Gog∣magog,</HI> have brought him so far already, that he speaks respectfully of St. <HI>Christo∣pher</HI>'s carrying Christ, and the Resuscitation of St. <HI>Nicholas Tolentine</HI>'s Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in converting each other from all manner of Infidelity.</P>
<P><HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> are no more, compared to <HI>Corinaeus</HI> and <HI>Arthur,</HI> than the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Ghibellines</HI> were to the <HI>Mohocks</HI> of e∣verdreadful memory. This amazing Writer has made me lay aside <HI>Homer</HI> for a Week, and when I take him up again, I shall be very well prepared to translate with belief and reverence the Speech of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Horse.</P>
<P>You'll excuse all this trifling, or any thing else which prevents a Sheet full of Compliment: And believe there is nothing more true (even more true than any thing in <HI>Jeffery</HI> is false) than that I have a con∣stant Affection for you, and am, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="171" REF="315"/>
He had liv'd in such a Course of Tem∣perance as was enough to make the longest Life agreeable to him, and in such a Course of Piety as suffic'd to make the most sud∣den Death so also. Sudden indeed it was: However, I heartily beg of God to give me such an one, provided I can lead such a Life. I leave him to the Mercy of God, and to the Piety of a Religion that extends beyond the Grave: <HI>Si qua est ea cura,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He has left me to the ticklish Management of a narrow Fortune, where every false Step is dangerous. My Mother is in that dispi∣rited State of Resignation, which is the ef∣fect of long Life, and the Loss of what is dear to us. We are really each of us in want of a Friend, of such an humane Turn as yourself, to make almost any thing desira∣ble to us. I feel your Absence more than ever, at the same time I can less express my Regards to you than ever; and shall make this, which is the most sincere Letter I ever writ to you, the shortest and faintest perhaps of any you have receiv'd. 'Tis enough if you reflect, that barely to remember any Person, when one's Mind is taken up with a sensible Sorrow, is a great degree of Friendship. I can say no more but that I love you, and all that are yours; and that I wish it may be very long before any of yours shall feel for you what I now feel for my Father. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this Country ever since your departure. I am pleas'd to date this from a place so well known to Mrs. <HI>Blount,</HI> where I write as if I were dictated by her Ancestors, whose faces are all upon me. I fear none so much as Sir <HI>Christopher Guise,</HI> who being in his Shirt, seems as ready to combate me, as her own Sir <HI>John</HI> was to demolish Duke <HI>Lancastere.</HI> I dare say your Lady will re∣collect his Figure. I look'd upon the Man∣sion, Walls, and Terraces; the Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has made to command a variety of Valleys and rising Woods; with a Veneration mixt with a Pleasure, that represented her to me in those puerile Amusements, which engaged her so many Years ago in this place: I fancy'd I saw her sober over a Sampler, or gay over a jointed Baby. I dare say she did one thing more, even in those early

times; <HI>remember'd her Creator in the Days of her Youth.</HI></P>
<P>You describe so well your Heremitical state of Life, that none of the antient An∣chorites could go beyond you, for a Cave in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of the Accommodations that befit a Solitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of those venerable and holy Personages took with them a Lady, and begat Sons and Daughters. You must modestly be con∣tent to be accounted a Patriarch. But were you a little younger, I should rather rank you with Sir <HI>Amadis,</HI> and his fellows. If Piety be so Romantick, I shall turn Hermit in good earnest; for I see one may go so far as to be Poetical, and hope to save one's Soul at the same time. I really wish my∣self something more, that is, a Prophet; for I wish I were as <HI>Habakkuk,</HI> to be taken by the Hair of the Head, and visit <HI>Daniel</HI> in his Den. You are very obliging in say∣ing, I have now a whole Family upon my hands, to whom to discharge the part of a Friend: I assure you I like 'em all so well, that I will never quit my Hereditary Right to them; you have made me yours, and consequently them mine. I still see them walking on my Green at <HI>Twickenham,</HI> and gratefully remember (not only their green

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very kind and obliging man∣ner of enquiring after me, among the first Concerns of Life, at your Resuscitation, should have been sooner answer'd and ac∣knowledg'd. I sincerely rejoice at your re∣covery from an Illness which gave me less pain than it did you, only from my Igno∣rance of it. I should have else been seri∣ously and deeply affected, in the thought of your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a private Letter of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> giving an account of the last words of an intimate Friend of his: <Q REND="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain I feel will soon be over, but I grieve for
<PB N="175" REF="319"/>
that you are to feel, which is to last you for life.'</Q></P>
<P>I join with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man some∣what longer. The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoune</HI> said one day to me: <Q REND="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to die; I am a poor Individual; no Creature to wish, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only reason I have to repent be∣ing a single Man; now I grow old, I am like a Tree without a Prop, and without young Trees of my own shedding, to grow round me, for Company and Defence.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope the Gout will soon go after the Fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an Interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards, except the Gout. Pray come, and never stir from us again. Do away your dirty Acres, cast 'em to dirty People, such as in the Scripture-Phrase <HI>possess the Land.</HI> Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in <HI>Milton.</HI><Q><L>The tawny Lyon, pawing to get free</L>
<L>His hinder Parts, he springs as broke from Bonds,</L>
<L>And rampant shakes his brinded Main: the Ounce,</L>

<L>Rising, the crumbled Earth above them throw</L>
<L>In Hillocks!</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="320"/>
But I believe <HI>Milton</HI> never thought, these fine Verses of his should be apply'd to a Man selling a parcel of dirty Acres; tho' in the main I think it may have some re∣semblance; for God knows this little space of Ground nourishes, buries, and confines us, as that of <HI>Eden</HI> did those Creatures, till we can shake it loose, at least in our Affections and Desires.</P>
<P>Believe, dear Sir, I truly love and value you; let Mrs. <HI>Blount</HI> know that she is in the list of my <HI>Memento Domine's Famulo∣rum Famularumque's,</HI> &amp;c. My poor Mo∣ther is far from well, declining; and I am watching over her, as we watch an expiring Taper, that even when it looks brightest, wastes fastest.

<Q><L>Alas! I live at <HI>Twickenham!</HI></L></Q>
<P>I take that Period to be very sublime, and to include more than a hundred Sentences that might be writ to express Distraction, Hurry, Multiplication of Nothings, and all the fati∣guing perpetual Business of having no Busi∣ness to do. You'll wonder I reckon translating the <HI>Odyssey</HI> as nothing? But whenever I think

seriously (and of late I have met with so ma∣ny Occasions of thinking seriously, that I be∣gin never to think otherwise) I cannot but think these things very idle; as idle, as if a Beast of Burden should go on jingling his Bells, without bearing any thing valuable about him, or ever serving his Master.</P>
<P><Q><L>Life's vain Amusements, amidst which we dwell;</L>
<L>Not weigh'd, or understood by the grim God of Hell!</L></Q>
Said a Heathen Poet; as he is translated by a Christian Bishop, who has, first by his Exhortations, and since by his Example, taught me to <HI>think</HI> as becomes a Reasonable Creature.—But he is gone! He carry'd a∣way more Learning than is left in this Nati∣on behind him: but he left us more in the noble Example of bearing Calamity well. 'Tis true, we want Literature very much; but pray God we don't want Patience more! if these Precedents are to prevail.</P>
<P>I remember I promis'd to write to you, as soon as I should hear you were got home. You must look on this as the first Day I've been myself, and pass over the Mad Interval un-imputed to me. How punctual a Cor∣respondent I shall hence-forward be able, or not able, to be, God knows: but he knows I shall ever be a punctual and grate∣ful Friend, and all the good Wishes of such an one will ever attend you.</P>

<P>YOU shew your self a just Man and a Friend in those Guesses and Supposi∣tions you make at the possible reasons of my Silence; every one of which is a true one. As to forgetfulness of you or your's, I assure you, the promiscuous Conversations of the Town serve only to put me in mind of bet∣ter, and more quiet, to be had in a Corner of the World (undisturb'd, innocent, serene, and sensible) with such as you. Let no Ac∣cess of any Distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny Weather. Let the young Ladies be assured I make nothing new in my Gardens without wishing to see the print of their Fairy Steps in every part of 'em. I have put the last Hand to my works of this kind, in happily finishing the subter∣raneous Way and Grotto; I there found a Spring of the clearest Water, which falls in a perpetual Rill, that ecchoes thro' the Cavern day and night. From the Ri∣ver <HI>Thames,</HI> you see thro' my Arch up a Walk of the Wilderness to a kind of open
<PB N="172" REF="324"/>
Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the Rustic Manner; and from that distance un∣der the Temple you look down thro' a slop∣ing Arcade of Trees, and see the Sails on the River passing suddenly and vanishing, as thro' a Perspective Glass. When you shut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the instant, from a luminous Room, a <HI>Camera obscura;</HI> on the Walls of which all the Ob∣jects of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture in their visible Radiations: And when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different Scene: it is finished with Shells interpersed with Pieces of Looking-glass in angular forms; and in the Ceiling is a Star of the same Material, at which when a Lamp (of an or∣bicular Figure of thin Alabaster) is hung in the Middle, a thousand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place. There are connected to this Grotto by a narrower Pas∣sage two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one toward the River, of smooth Stones, full of light and open; the other toward the Arch of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints, and Iron Ore. The Bottom is paved with simple Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil∣derness to the Temple, is to be Cockle-shells, in the natural Taste, agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place. It wants nothing
<PB N="173" REF="325"/>
to compleat it but a good Statue with an Inscription, like that beautiful antique one which you know I am so fond of,<Q><L>Hujus Nympha loci, sacri custodia fontis</L>

<L>Whoe'er thou art, ah gently tread the Cave,</L>

<P>You'll think I have been very Poetical in this Description, but it is pretty near the Truth. I wish you were here to bear Tes∣timony how little it owes to Art, either the Place itself, or the Image I give of it.</P>

<P>I Should be asham'd to own the receipt of a very kind Letter from you, two whole Months from the date of this; if I were not
<PB N="174" REF="326"/>
more asham'd to tell a Lye, or to make an Excuse, which is worse than a Lye (for be∣ing built upon some probable Circumstance, it makes use of a degree of Truth to falsity with: It is a Lye <HI>Guarded</HI>). Your Letter has been in my Pocket in constant wearing, till that, and the Pocket, and the Suit, are worn out; by which means, I have read it forty times, and I find by so doing, that I have not enough consider'd, and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with; for true Friendship, as they say of good Writing, will bear reviewing a thousand times, and still discover new beauties.</P>
<P>I have had a Fever, a short one, but a vi∣olent: I am now well. So it shall take up no more of this Paper.</P>
<P>I begin now to expect you in Town, to make the Winter to come more tolera∣ble to us both. The Summer is a kind of Heaven, when we wander in a Paradisaical Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens; but at this Season, we are like our poor first Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' so∣litary life, and forc'd to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get in∣to warmer Houses, and hive together in Ci∣ties.</P>
<P>I hope you are long since perfectly restor'd, and risen from your Gout, happy in the delights of a contented Family, smiling at
<PB N="175" REF="327"/>
Storms, laughing at Greatness, and merry o∣ver a Christmas-fire, exercising all the Func∣tions of an old Patriarch in Charity and Hospitality. I will not tell Mrs <HI>B.</HI> what I think she is doing; for I conclude it is her opinion, that he only ought to know it for whom it is done: and she will allow herself to be far enough advanc'd above a fine La∣dy, not to desire to shine before Men.</P>
<P>Your Daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts, which even their Mother must excuse them for, because she is a Mo∣ther. I will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their Devotions, but rather excite 'em, and assist the warmth of them; while their Prayer may be, that they may raise up and breed as irreproach∣able a young Family as their Parents have done. In a Word, I fancy you all well, easy, and happy, just as I wish you; and next to that I wish you all with me.</P>
<P>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in dignity, and next in value. <HI>Minuisti eum paullo minus ab Angelis.</HI> If therefore I wish well to the good and the deserving, and de∣sire They only shou'd be my Companions and Correspondents; I must very soon, and very much think of you. I want your Company, and your Example. Pray make haste to Town, so as not again to leave us: Discharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,
<PB N="176" REF="328"/>
like one of the Mountains under which the Poets say the Giants (that is, the <HI>Men of the Earth</HI>) are whelmed: Leave Earth to the Sons of Earth; your Conversation is in Hea∣ven. Which that it may be accomplish'd in us all, is the Prayer of him who maketh this short Sermon. Value (to you) Three Pence. Adieu.</P>

<P>YOU writ me a very kind Letter some months ago, and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into <HI>Devonshire.</HI> That hindered my an∣swering you, and I have since several times inquir'd of you, without any Satisfaction; for so I call the knowledge of your wel∣fare, or of any thing that concerns you.

Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> too has been silent all this year; I believe he has been displeas'd at some or other of my Freedoms; which I very innocently take, and most with those I think most my friends. But this I know nothing of; perhaps he may have open'd to you: And, if I know you right, you are of a Temper to cement Friendships, and not to divide them. I really much love Mr. <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and have a true affection for your self, which if I had any Interest in the world, or Power with those who have, I shou'd not be long without manifesting to you. I desire you will not, either out of Modesty, or a vicious Distrust of another's value for you, (those two Eternal Foes to Merit) imagine that your Letters and Con∣versation are not always welcome to me. There's no man more intirely fond of good∣nature or ingenuity than my self, and I have seen too much of those qualities in Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> to be any thing less than his</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been my good fortune within this month past, to hear more things that have pleas'd me than (I think) almost in all my time beside. But nothing upon my word has been so Home-felt a satis∣faction as the News you tell me of your self: and you are not in the least mista∣ken, when you congratulate me upon your own good Success; for I have more People to be happy out of, than any ill-natur'd man can boast I may with honesty af∣firm to you, that notwithstanding the ma∣ny Inconveniencies and Disadvantages they commonly talk of in the <HI>Res angusti domi,</HI> I have never found any other, than the inability of giving people of Merit the only certain proof of our value for them, in doing 'em some real service. For, after all, if we could but Think a little, Self∣love might make us Philosophers, and con∣vince us, <HI>Quantuli indiget Natura!</HI> Our∣selves are easily provided for; 'tis nothing but the Circumstantials, and the Apparatus or Equipage of human life that costs so much the furnishing. Only what a luxu∣rious Man wants for horses and foot-men;

<P>I shall see you this Winter with much greater pleasure than I could the last; and I hope as much of your Time as your At∣tendance on the Dutchess will allow you to spare to any friend, will not be thought lost upon one who is as much so as any man. I must also put you in mind, tho' you are now Secretary to this Lady, that you are likewise Secretary to Nine other Ladies, and are to write sometimes for them too. He who is forc'd to live wholly upon those Ladies favours, is indeed in as precarious a condition as any He who does what <HI>Chaucer</HI> says—for <HI>Sustenance;</HI> but they are very agreeable Companions, like other Ladies, when a Man only passes a Night or so with them at his leisure, and away.

<P>JUST as I receiv'd yours, I was set down to write to you with some shame that I had so long deferr'd it. But I can hardly repent my neglect, when it
<PB N="189" REF="333"/>
gives me the knowledge how little you insist upon Ceremony, and how much a greater share in your memory I have than I deserve. I have been near a week in <HI>London,</HI> where I am like to remain, till I become, by Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>'s help, <HI>Elegans For∣marum Spectator.</HI> I begin to discover Beau∣ties that were till now imperceptible to me. Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn of a Nose or Ear, the smallest degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim∣ple, have charms to distract me. I no long∣er look upon Lord <HI>Plausible</HI> as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow (as the <HI>Plain-dealer</HI> has it) but am in some danger even from the Ugly and Disagreeable, since they may have their retired beauties, in one Trait or other about 'em. You may guess in how uneasy a state I am, when every day the per∣formances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more despica∣ble. I have thrown away three Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s, each of which was once my vanity, two Lady <HI>Bridgewaters,</HI> a Dutchess of <HI>Montague,</HI> besides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight of the Garter. I have crucify'd <HI>Christ</HI> over again in effigie, and made a <HI>Madona</HI> as old as her Mother St. <HI>Anne.</HI> Nay, what is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd St. <HI>Luke</HI> himself in Painting, and as 'tis said
<PB N="190" REF="334"/>
an Angel came and finish'd his Piece, so you would swear a Devil put the last hand to mine, 'tis so begrim'd and smutted. However, I comfort my self with a Chri∣stian Reflection, that I have not broken the Commandment, for my Pictures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the waters under the earth. Neither will any body adore or worship them, except the <HI>Indians</HI> should have a sight of 'em, who, they tell us, worship certain Pagods or Idols purely for their Ugliness.</P>
<P>I am very much recreated and refreshed with the News of the Advancement of the <HI>Fan,</HI> which I doubt not will delight the Eye and Sense of the Fair, as long as that agreeable Machine shall play in the Hands of Posterity. I am glad your <HI>Fan</HI> is mount∣ed so soon, but I would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure, and polish the Sticks as much as you can. You may then cause it to be born in the Lands of both Sexes, no less in <HI>Britain,</HI> than it is in <HI>China;</HI> where it is ordinary for a <HI>Mandarine</HI> to fan himself cool after a Debate, and a States∣man to hide his face with it when he tells a grave Lye.</P>

<P>SINCE by your letter we find you can be content to breath in smoak, to walk in crouds, and divert your self with noise, nay, and to make fine Pictures of this way of life, we shou'd give you up as one aban∣doned to a wrong choice of pleasures. We have however so much compassion on you, as to think of inviting you to us, where your taste for books, friendship, and ease, may be indulg'd. But if you do not come, pray leave to tempt us with your descrip∣tion of the Court; for indeed humanity is frail, and we cannot but remember some particular honours which we have enjoy'd in conversation; bate us this one point, and we stand you, still untir'd with one an∣other, and fresh to the pleasures of the coun∣try. If you wou'd have any news from us, know that we are well at present: This I am sure wou'd have been allow'd by you as news from either of us a fortnight ago.

<P>ABOVE all other News, send us the best, that of your good Health, if you enjoy it; which Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> made us very much fear. If you have any design either to amend your health, or your life, I know no better Expedient than to come hither, where you should not want room, tho' I lay my self in a Trucklebed under the Doctor. You might here converse with the old Greeks, be initiated into all their Customs, and learn their Prayers by heart as we have done: The Doctor last <HI>Sunday,</HI> in∣tending to say an <HI>Our Father,</HI> was got half way in <HI>Chryses'</HI> Prayer to <HI>Apollo.</HI> The ill effects of Contention and Squabling, so lively describ'd in the first Iliad, make Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and my self continue in the most exemplary Union in every thing.

As we rise in our speculations daily, we are grown so grave, that we have not con∣descended to laugh at any of the idle things about us this week: I have contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation on high subjects, equal to the formidable Front of black-brow'd <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and become an awful Nod as well, when I assent to some grave and weighty Proposition of the Doc∣tor, or inforce a Criticism of my own.

<P>In this state, I cannot consent to your publication of that ludicrous trifling Bur∣lesque you write about. Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> also joins in my opinion, that it will by no means be well to print it.</P>
<P>Pray give (with the utmost fidelity and esteem) my hearty service to the Dean, Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ford,</HI> and to Mr. <HI>Fortescue.</HI> Let them also know at <HI>Button</HI>'s that I am mindful of them. I am, divine Buco∣liast!</P>

<P>I HAVE been perpetually troubled with sickness of late, which has made me so melancholy, that the Immortality of the Soul has been my constant Speculation, as the Mortality of my Body my constant Plague. In good earnest, <HI>Seneca</HI> is nothing to a fit of illness.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> will honour <HI>Tonson</HI>'s Miscel∣lany with some very beautiful Copies, at my request. He enters heartily into our design; I only fear his stay in town may chance to be but short. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> much approves what I proposed, even to the very title, which I design shall be, <HI>The Works of the Unlearned,</HI> published monthly, in which whatever Book appears that deserves praise, shall be depreciated Ironically, and in the same manner that modern Critics take to undervalue Works of Value, and to com∣mend the high Productions of <HI>Grubstreet.</HI></P>

If happy, I am to share in your elevation; if unhappy, you have still a warm corner in my heart, and a retreat at <HI>Binfield</HI> in the worst of times at your service. If you are a <HI>Tory,</HI> or thought so by any man, I know it can proceed from nothing but your Gratitude
<PB N="196" REF="340"/>
to a few People, who endeavour'd to serve you, and whose Politicks were never your Concern. If you are a <HI>Whig,</HI> as I rather hope, and as I think your Principles and mine (as Brother Poets) had ever a Byass to the Side of Liberty, I know you will be an honest man and an inoffensive one. Upon the whole, I know you are incapable of being so much of either Party as to be good for nothing. Therefore once more, what∣ever you are, or in whatever state you are, All Hail!</P>
<P>One or two of your old Friends com∣plain'd they had heard nothing from you since the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Death; I told 'em, no man living lov'd Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> better than I, yet I had not once written to him in all his Voyage. This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month. But they had reasons too themselves to al∣ledge in your excuse, as men who really value one another will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy. The late universal Concern in publick af∣fairs, threw us all into a hurry of Spirits; even I, who am more a Philosopher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was born away with the current, and full of the expectation of the Successor: During your Journeys I knew not whither to aim

a letter after you, that was a sort of shoot∣ing flying: add to this the demand <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> had upon me, to write fifty Verses a day, besides learned Notes, all which are at a conclusion for this year. Rejoice with me, O my Friend, that my La∣bour is over; come and make merry with me in much Feasting, for I to thee, and thou to me. We will feed among the Lilies. By the Lilies, I mean the Ladies, with whom I hope you have fed to Satiety: Hast thou passed through many Countries, and not tasted the delights thereof? Hast thou not left to thy Issue in divers Lands, that <HI>Ger∣man Gays</HI> and <HI>Dutch Gays</HI> may arise, to write Pastorals, and sing their Songs in strange Countries? Are not the <HI>Blouzelin∣da's</HI> of the <HI>Hague</HI> as charming as the <HI>Ro∣salinda's</HI> of <HI>Britain?</HI> or have the two great Pastoral Poets of our Nation renounced Love at the same time? for <HI>Philips,</HI> im∣mortal <HI>Philips, Hanover Philips,</HI> hath de∣serted, yea and in a rustick manner kicked his <HI>Rosalind.</HI>—Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and I have been inseparable ever since you went.

I shall not enter into a detail of my Concerns and Troubles, for two reasons; because I am really afflicted and need no Airs of grief, and because they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my self.

<P>I should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from <HI>Aix;</HI> you told me then, that writing was not good with the Waters,
<PB N="200" REF="344"/>
and I find since you are of my opinion, that 'tis as bad without the Waters. But I fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that is so bad with the Waters; and then you might write without any manner of pre∣judice, if you writ like our Brother-poets of these days.</P>
<P>I have no story to tell that is worth your hearing: you know I am no man of Intrigue; but the Duchess of <HI>Hamilton</HI> has one which she says is worth my hearing, that relates to Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> and your self; and which she promises, if you won't tell me, she will.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS very much pleas'd, not to say oblig'd, by your kind letter, which sufficiently warm'd my heart to have an∣swer'd it sooner, had I not been deceiv'd (a way one often is deceiv'd) by hearkening to Women; who told me that both Lady <HI>Burlington</HI> and yourself were immediately to return from <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and that my Lord was gone to bring you back. The world furnishes us with too many examples of what you complain of in yours, and I as∣sure you, none of them touch and grieve me so much as what relates to you. I think your Sentiments upon it are the very same I should entertain: I wish those we call Great Men had the same Notions, but they are really the most Little Creatures in the world; and the most interested, in all but one Point; which is, that they want Judg∣ment

<P>Pray make my sincere compliments to Lord <HI>Burlington,</HI> whom I have long known to have more Mind to be a Good and honourable man, than almost any one of his rank.</P>
<P>I have not forgot yours to Lord <HI>Boling∣broke,</HI> (tho' I hope to have speedily a fuller opportunity) he returns for <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> next Month.</P>

<P>I Faithfully assure you, in the midst of that melancholy with which I have been so long encompassed, in an hourly Expectation almost of my Mother's death; there was no circumstance that render'd it more insupportable to me, than that I could not leave her to see you. Your own pre∣sent Escape from so imminent danger, I pray God may prove less precarious than my poor Mother's can be; whose Life at her age can at best be but a short Reprieve, or a longer Dying. But I fear, even that is more than God will please to grant me; for, these two days past, her most dangerous Symptoms are returned upon her; and unless there be a sudden change, I must in a few days, if not in a few Hours, be de∣priv'd of her. In the afflicting Prospect be∣fore me, I know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the View now given me (Heaven grant it may encrease!) of your recovery. In the sincerity of my heart, I am excessively concern'd, not to be able to pay you, dear <HI>Gay,</HI> any part of the debt I very gratefully remember I owe you, on a like sad occasion, when you was here com∣forting me in her last great Illness. May your

This being daily to be fear'd, makes me not dare to go a day from her, lest that should prove to be her Last.

<P>I AM glad to hear of the progress of your recovery, and the oftner I hear it the better, when it becomes easy to you to give it me. I so well remember the Con∣solation you were to me in my Mother's former Illness, that it doubles my Concern at this time not to be able to be with you, or you able to be with me. Had I lost her, I wou'd have been no where else but with you during your confinement. I have now past five weeks without once going from home, and without any company but for three or four of the days. Friends rarely stretch their kindness so far as ten miles. My Lord <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bethel</HI> have not forgotten to visit me: the rest (except Mrs. <HI>Blount</HI> once) were contented to send messages.

<P>IF my friendship were as effectual as it is sincere, you would be one of those people who would be vastly advantag'd and enrich'd by it.

And I now honour Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> for his extensive Bounty and Goodness to his private Friends and Relations. But it vexes me to the heart when I reflect, that my friendship is so much less effectual than theirs; nay so utterly useless that it can∣not give you any thing, not even a Dinner, at this distance, nor help the General, whom I greatly love, to catch one fish. My only consolation is to think you happier than myself, and to begin to envy you, which is next to hating (an excellent Remedy for Love.) How comes it that Providence has been so unkind to me, (who am a greater object of compassion than any fat man alive) that I am forc'd to drink wine, while you

I have been putting my Library in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my Mind and Body (if I can) to some Life. A Friend,

(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years, advised me to pass more time in my studies: I reflected, she must have found some Reason for this admoni∣tion, and concluded she wou'd compleat all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the Employment I am fittest for; Con∣versation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</P>

In any of these Cases, indeed, I might have judged him too presumptuous, and perhaps have trembled for his Rashness.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this small and modest Epistle, which attacks <HI>no one Vice</HI> whatsoever; which deals only in <HI>Folly,</HI> and not Folly in general, but a single Spe∣cies of it; that only Branch, for the oppo∣site Excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written must necessarily be cele∣brated.

<L>Health to himself, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q>Is this such a <HI>Crime,</HI> that to impute it to a Man must be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an <HI>Innocent Folly,</HI> and much more <HI>Beneficent</HI> than the Want of it; for <HI>Ill Taste</HI> employs more hands, and diffuses Expence more than a <HI>Good</HI> one. Is it a <HI>Moral</HI> Defect? No, it is but a <HI>Natural</HI> one; a <HI>Want of Taste.</HI> It is what the best good Man living may be liable to: The worthiest Peer may live ex∣emplarily in an ill-favour'd House, and the best reputed Citizen be pleased with a vile Garden. I thought (I say) the Author had
<PB N="225" REF="369"/>
the common Liberty to observe a Defect, and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that distinguishes him: which I know not how any Quality should do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But, they say, the Satire is <HI>Personal.</HI> I thought it could not be so, because all its Reflexions are on <HI>Things.</HI> His Reflexions are not on the <HI>Man,</HI> but his House, Garden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay, he respects (as one may say) the <HI>Persons</HI> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the Nile and the Triton: He is only sorry to see them (as he might be to see any of his <HI>Friends</HI>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong Place, and in bad Company.

<P>I know no Remedy, unless people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres, as they begin to do the Churches; un∣less Comedy were forsaken, Satire silent, and every man left to do what seems good in his own Eyes, as if there were no King, no Priest, no Poet in <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>But I find myself obliged to touch a Point, on which I must be more serious; it well deserves I should: I mean the malicious Ap∣plication of the Character of <HI>Timon,</HI> which I will boldly say, they would impute to the Person the most different in the World from a <HI>Man-hater,</HI> and the Person whose <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Wit</HI> have often been shewn in the <HI>rightest Place.</HI> The Author of that Epistle must certainly think so, if he has the same Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have; for he has been favoured by this very Person.</P>
<P>Why, in God's Name, must a <HI>Portrait,</HI> apparently collected from twenty different Men, be applied to one only? Has it his <HI>Eye?</HI> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <HI>Nose</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="371"/>
or <HI>Mouth?</HI> No, they are totally differing. What then, I beseech you? Why, it has the <HI>Mole on his Chin.</HI> Very well; but must the Picture therefore be his, and has no other man that Blemish?</P>
<P>Could there be a more melancholy In∣stance how much the Taste of the Publick is vitiated, and turns the most salutary and seasonable Physick into Poison, than if amidst the Blaze of a thousand bright Qualities in a Great Man, they should only remark there is a <HI>Shadow</HI> about him, as what Eminence is without? I am con∣fident the Author was incapable of im∣puting any such to One, whose whole Life (to use his own Expression in Print of him) is <HI>a continued Series</HI> of good and generous Actions.</P>
<P>I know no man who would be more concerned, if he gave the least Pain or Offence to any innocent Person; and none who would be less concerned, if the Sa∣tire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it, If ever that hap∣pens, I dare engage he will own it, with all the Freedom of one whose <HI>Censures</HI> are <HI>just,</HI> and who sets his <HI>Name</HI> to them.</P>

<P>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epistle to you, could not give me so much pain, as I receiv'd pleasure in seeing the general Zeal of the world in the cause of a great Man who is Beneficent, and the particular Warmth of your Lordship in that of a private Man who is innocent.</P>
<P>It was not the <HI>Poem</HI> that deserv'd this from you; for as I had the Honour to be your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like a Poet: but sure the <HI>Writer</HI> deserv'd more Candor, even from those who knew him not, than to promote a Report, which in regard to that Noble Person was <HI>Imper∣tinent;</HI> in regard to me, <HI>Villainous.</HI> Yet I had no great cause to wonder, that a Character belonging to <HI>twenty</HI> shou'd be applied to <HI>one;</HI> since, by that means, <HI>nineteen</HI> wou'd escape the Ridicule.</P>
<P>I was too well content with my Know∣ledge of that Noble Person's Opinion in this Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But

since Malice and Mistake are so long a dy∣ing, I have taken the opportunity of a third Edition to declare <HI>His Belief,</HI> not only of <HI>My Innocence,</HI> but of <HI>Their Malignity,</HI> of the former of which my own heart is as con∣scious, as I fear some of theirs must be of the latter.

<P>However, my Lord, I own, that Critics of <HI>this Sort</HI> can intimidate me, nay half incline me to write no more: That wou'd be making the Town a Compliment which I think it deserves; and which some, I am sure, wou'd take very kindly.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you men∣tion. I have nothing to repay my Friends with at present, but prayers and good wishes. I have the satisfaction to find that I am as officiously serv'd by my Friends, as he that has thousands to leave in Legacies; besides the Assurance of their Sincerity,
<PB N="231" REF="375"/>
God Almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be: I have found some relief, at least sometimes, from the Air of this Place. My Nights are bad, but many poor Creatures have worse.</P>
<P>As for you, my good Friend, I think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little Suspicions or Jealousies that often affect the sincerest Friendships; I am sure not on my side. I must be so sincere as to own, that tho' I could not help valuing you for those Talents which the World prizes, yet they were not the Foun∣dation of my Friendship: They were quite of another sort; nor shall I at present offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Last Request, that you continue that noble <HI>Disdain</HI> and <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of Vice, which you seem naturally endu'd with, but still with a due regard to your own Safety; and study more to reform than chastise, tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI> I have always honour'd for every good Quality, that a Person of his Rank ought to have: Pray give my Respects and kindest Wishes to the Family. My Ve∣nison Stomach is gone, but I have those about me, and often with me, who will be very glad of his Present. If it is left
<PB N="232" REF="376"/>
at my house it will be transmitted safe to me.</P>

<P>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World, whose loss itself they do not so much re∣gret, as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it. For I do not know one thing for which I can envy <HI>London,</HI> but for your continuing there. Yet I guess you
<PB N="234" REF="378"/>
will expect I should recant this Expression, when I tell you, that <HI>Sapho</HI> (by which hea∣thenish Name you have christen'd a very orthodox Lady) did not accompany me in∣to the Country. However, I will confess myself the less concern'd on that account, because I have no very violent Inclination to lose my Heart, especially in so wild and savage a place as this Forest is: In the Town, 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his stray'd Heart again, with some <HI>Wild∣street</HI> or <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Damfel; but here, where I could have met with no redress from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I must for ever have lost my little Traveller in a Hole, where I could never rummage to find him again.—Well, Sir, you have your Lady in the Town still, and I have my Heart in the Country still, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more room in it for my Friends, and does not want a Corner at your Service.—To be serious, you have extremely oblig'd me by your Frankness and Kindness to me: And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part, I hope you will at∣tribute it to the natural Openness of my Temper, which hardly knows how to show Respect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd love my Friend, as my Mistress, without Ceremony; and hope a little rough Usage
<PB N="235" REF="379"/>
sometimes may not be more displeasing to the one, than it is to the other.</P>
<P>If you have any Curiosity to know in what manner I live, or rather lose a Life, <HI>Martial</HI> will inform you in one Line: (the Translation of which cost a Friend of ours three in <HI>English,</HI><Q><L>(One short, one long,</L>

<P>Every Day with me is literally an∣other yesterday; for it is exactly the same; It has the same Business, which is Poetry; and the same Pleasure, whieh is Idleness. A man might indeed pass his Time much better, but I question if any Man could pass it much easier. If you will visit our Shades this Spring, which I very much desire, you may perhaps instruct me to manage my Game more wisely; but at present I am satisfy'd to trifle away my Time any Way, rather than let it stick by me; as Shop-keepers are glad to be rid of those Goods at any rate, which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands.</P>
<P>Sir, if you will favour me sometimes with your Letters, it will be a great Satisfaction

<P>I Have nothing to say to you in this Let∣ter; but I was resolv'd to write to tell you so. Why should not I content myself with so many great Examples, of deep Di∣vines, profound Casuists, grave Philosophers, who have written, not Letters only, but whole Tomes and voluminous Treatises about Nothing? Why shou'd a Fellow like me, who all his life does nothing, be a∣sham'd to write nothing? and that to one who has nothing to do but to read it?

<P>YOU talk of Fame and Glory, and of the great Men of Antiquity: Pray tell me, what are all your great dead Men, but so many little living Letters? What a vast Reward is here for all the Ink wasted by Writers, and all the Blood spilt by Princes? There was in old time one <HI>Severus</HI> a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor. I dare say you never call'd him by any other Name in your Life: and yet in his days he was styl'd <HI>Lucius, Septimius, Severus, Pius, Pertinax, Augustus, Parthi∣cus, Adiabenicus, Arabicus, Maximus,</HI>—and what not? What a prodigious waste of Letters has Time made! what a Number have here dropt off, and lest the poor sur∣viving Seven unattended!

<P>I Have been so well satisfy'd with the Country ever since I saw you, that I have not so much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it besides Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> and yourself. And from him I understand of your Journey this Sum∣mer into <HI>Leicestershire;</HI> from whence I guess you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Business of comparing Critics, and re∣conciling
<PB N="239" REF="383"/>
reconciling commentators; and to the old diversions of a losing game at Picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Hearing.</NOTE>Sense which there for the most part could only serve to disgust you, enjoy the vigour of another which ravishes you.
<Q><L>You know when one Sense is supprest,</L>
<L>It but retires into the rest.</L></Q></P>
<P>(According to the poetical, not the learn∣ed, <HI>Dodwell;</HI> who has done one thing wor∣thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the Boxes, without being trou∣bled with any of the dulness of the Stage. You are so good a critic, that 'tis the great∣est happiness of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not so arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the rest) without hearing. But now I talk of those critics, I have good news to tell you concerning myself, for which I expect you shou'd congratulate with me: It is, that beyond all my expectations, and
<PB N="240" REF="384"/>
far above my demerits, I have been most mercifully repriev'd by the sovereign power of <HI>Jacob Tonson,</HI> from being brought forth to publick punishment; and respited from time to time from the hands of those bar∣barous executioners of the Muses, whom I was just now speaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver themselves into the hands of Ju∣stice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage; and not out of any Ambition to spread their fame, by be∣ing executed in the face of the world, which is a fame but of short continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninety-nine years; for those names very rarely last so many days, which are planted either in <HI>Jacob Tonson</HI>'s, or the <HI>Ordinary of Newgate</HI>'s Miscellanies.</P>
<P>I have an hundred things to say to you, which shall be deferr'd till I have the hap∣piness of seeing you in town; for the sea∣son now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had communi∣cated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain were you pass'd your time the last season: so much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the pleasure you cou'd desire from the coun∣try,
<PB N="241" REF="385"/>
and your own thoughts the best com∣pany in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> to our Forest; he continu'd (as you told me long since he wou'd) an ob∣stinate lover of the town, in spite of friend∣ship and fair weather. Therefore hence∣forward, to all those considerable qualities I know you possest of, I shall add that of Prophecy. But I still believe Mr. <HI>Wycher∣ley</HI>'s intentions were good, and am satisfy'd that he promises nothing but with a real design to perform it: how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imi∣tation, his sincerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmost that I am,</P>

without suspicion of their miscarrying; not that they are of the least value, but for fear somebody might be foolish enough to imagine them so, and inquisitive enough to discover those faults which I (by your help) wou'd correct. I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber, and to be very free of your re∣marks in the margins, not only in regard to the accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran∣slation; which I have not had time of late to compare with its original. And I desire you to be the more severe, as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense, than to do it in my own proper person. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire version of the first book. There is an omission from the 168th line—<HI>Jam murmura serpunt plebis ageno∣reae</HI>—to the 312th—<HI>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>—(between these <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These he since translated, and they are extant in the printed Version.</NOTE> two <HI>Statius</HI> has a description of the council of the Gods, and a speech of <HI>Ju∣piter;</HI> which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty, and were left out for no other reason, but because the consequence
<PB N="243" REF="387"/>
of this machine appears not till the second book.) The translation goes on from thence to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam,</HI> where there is an odd account of a battle at fifty-cuffs be∣tween the two Princes on a very slight occasion, and at a time when one wou'd think the fatigue of their Journey in so tem∣pestuous a night, might have render'd them very unfit for such a scuffle. This I had actually translated, but was very ill satis∣fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience; it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words—<HI>Hic primum lustrare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.—to the end of the book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt not, that <HI>Sta∣tius</HI> was none of the discreetest Poets, tho' he was the best versifier next <HI>Vir∣gil:</HI> In the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry, (which <HI>Horace</HI> had already taught the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>) when he asks his Muse, where to begin his <HI>Thebaid,</HI> and seems to doubt whe∣ther it should not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo?</HI> When he comes to the scene of his Poem, and the prize in dispute between the Brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it—
<PB N="244" REF="388"/>
<HI>Pugna est de paupere regno.</HI>—Very diffe∣rent from the conduct of his master <HI>Virgil,</HI> who at the entrance of his Poem informs his reader of the greatness of its sub∣ject,—<HI>Tantae molis erat Romanam condere Gentem.</HI> [Bossu <HI>on Epic Poetry.</HI>] There are innumerable little faults in him, a∣mong which I cannot but take notice of one in this book, where speaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers, he says, <HI>The whole world wou'd be too small a prize to repay so much impiety.</HI><Q><L>Quid si peteretur crimine tanto</L>
<L>Limes uterque Poli, quem Sol emissus Eoo</L>
<L>Cardine, aut portu vergens prospectat Ibero?</L></Q></P>
<P>This was pretty well, one wou'd think already, but he goes on.</P>
<Q><L>Quasque procul terras obliquo sydere tangit</L>
<L>Avius, aut Boreae gelidas, madidive tepentes</L>
<L>Igne Noti?</L></Q>
<P>After all this, what cou'd a Poet think of but Heaven itself for the Prize? but what follows is astonishing.<Q><L>—Quid si Tyriae Phrygiaeve sub unum</L>
<L>Convectentur Opes?</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="389"/>
I do not remember to have met with so great a fall in any antient author what∣soever. I shou'd not have insisted so much on the faults of this Poet, if I did not hope you wou'd take the same freedom with, and revenge it upon, his Translator. I shall be extremely glad if the reading this can be any amusement to you, the rather because I had the dissatisfaction to hear you have been confin'd to your chamber by an illness, which I fear was as troublesome a companion as I have sometimes been to you in the same place; where if ever you found any pleasure in my company, it must sure∣ly have been that which most men take in observing the faults and follies of ano∣ther; a pleasure which you see I take care to give you even in my absence.</P>
<P>If you will oblige me at your leisure with the confirmation of your recovery, under your own hand, it will be extreme grateful to me; for next to the pleasure of see∣ing my friends, is that I take in hearing from them; and in this particular, I am beyond all acknowledgments oblig'd to our friend Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> who, as if it were not enough to have excell'd all men in wit, is resolv'd to excel them in good-nature too.

I had I know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together, in which time all the Verses you see added, have been written; which I tell you that you may more freely be severe upon them. 'Tis a mercy I do not assault you with a number of original Sonnets and Epigrams, which our modrn Bards put forth in the spring∣time, in as great abundance, as Trees do

Blossoms, a very few whereof ever come to be Fruit, and please no longer than just in their birth. So that they make no less haste to bring their flowers of wit to the press, than gardeners to bring their other flowers to the market, which if they can't get off their hands in the morning, are sure to die before night.

And it is the happiness of this age, that the modern in∣vention of printing Poems for pence apiece, has brought the Nosegays of <HI>Parnassus</HI> to bear the same price; whereby the publick-spirited Mr. <HI>Henry Hills</HI> of <HI>Black-fryars</HI> has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the Learned, who never over-abounding in transitory coin, should not be discontented (methinks) even tho' Poems were distributed <HI>gratis</HI> about the streets, like <HI>Bunyan</HI>'s Sermons and other pious treatises, usually publish'd in a like Volume and Character.</P>

The <HI>Hiatus</HI> in particular I wou'd avoid as much as possible, to which you are certainly in the right to be a profess'd ene∣my; tho' I confess I cou'd not think it possible at all times to be avoided by any writer, till I found by reading <HI>Malherbe</HI> lately, that there is scarce any throughout his Poems. I thought your observation true enough to be pass'd into a Rule, but not a rule without exceptions, nor that ever it had been reduc'd to practise: But this ex∣ample of one of the most correct and best of their Poets has undeceiv'd me, and confirms your opinion very strongly, and much more than Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Authority, who tho' he made it a rule, seldom observ'd it.</P>

<P>I Have received part of the Version of <HI>Statius,</HI> and return you my thanks for your remarks which I think to be just, ex∣cept where you cry out (like one in <HI>Horace</HI>'s <HI>Art of Poetry</HI>) <HI>Pulchrè, benè, rectè!</HI> There I have some fears, you are often, if not al∣ways, in the wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="394"/>
One of your objections, namely on that passage,
<Q><L>The rest, revolving years shall ripen into Fate,</L></Q>
may be well grounded, in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the first book of <HI>Statius,</HI> Verse 302.</NOTE><HI>Cae∣tera reliquo ordine ducam.</HI> But the duration of the Action of <HI>Statius</HI>'s poem may as well be excepted against, as many things besides in him: (which I wonder <HI>Bossu</HI> has not ob∣serv'd) For instead of confining his narra∣tion to <HI>one year,</HI> it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books: The Narration begins with <HI>Oedipus</HI>'s prayer to the <HI>Fury</HI> to promote discord betwixt his Sons; af∣terward the Poet expresly describes their entrlng into the agreement of reigning a year by turns; and <HI>Polynices</HI> takes his flight for <HI>Thebes</HI> on his brother's refusal to resign the throne. All this is in the first book; in next, <HI>Tydeus</HI> is sent Ambassador to <HI>Etheo∣cles,</HI> and demands his resignation in these terms,<Q><L>—Astriferum velox jam circulus orbem</L>
<L>Torsit, &amp; amissae redierunt montibus umbrae,</L>
<L>Ex quo frater inops, ignota per oppida tristes</L>
<L>Exul agit casus—</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="395"/>
But <HI>Bossu</HI> himself is mistaken in one particular, relating to the commencement of the Action; saying in Book 2. Cap. 8. that <HI>Statius</HI> opens it with <HI>Europa</HI>'s <HI>Rape,</HI> whereas the Poet at most only deliberates whether he shou'd or not:
<Q><L>—Unde jubetis</L>
<L>Ire, Deae? Gentisne canam primordia, dirae,</L>
<L>Sidonios raptus? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
but then expresly passes all this with a <HI>Longa retro series</HI>—and says,
<Q><L>—Limes mihi carminis esto</L>
<L><HI>Oedipodae</HI> confusa domus—</L></Q>
Indeed there are numberless particulars blame-worthy in our Author, which I have try'd to soften in the version:
<Q><L>—Dubiam{que} jugo fragor impulit Oeten</L>
<L>In latus, &amp; geminis vix fluctibus obstitit Isthmus,</L></Q>
is most extravagantly hyperbolical: Nor did I ever read a greater piece of Tautology than<Q><L>—Vacua cum <HI>solus</HI> in Aula</L>
<L><HI>Respiceres</HI> jus omne tuum, cunctos{que} Minores,</L>
<L>Et nusquam <HI>par</HI> stare <HI>caput.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="396"/>
In the Journey of <HI>Polynices</HI> is some geo∣graphical error,
<Q><L>—In mediis audit duo litora campis</L></Q>
could hardly be; for the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Corinth</HI> is full five miles over: And <HI>Caligantes ab∣rupto sole Mycaenas,</HI> is not consistent with what he tells us, in Lib. 4. lin. 305: <Q REND="inline">"that those of <HI>Mycaenae</HI> came not to the war at this time, because they were then in con∣fusion by the divisions of the Brothers, <HI>Atreus</HI> and <HI>Thyestes:</HI>"</Q> Now from the raising the <HI>Greek</HI> army against <HI>The'es,</HI> back to the time of this journey of <HI>Polynices,</HI> is (accord∣ing to <HI>Statius</HI>'s own account) three years.</P>

<P>THE Morning after I parted from you, I found myself (as I had prophecy'd) all alone in an uneasy Stage-Coach; a dole∣ful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the least hope of entertainment but from my last recourse in such cases, a Book. I then be∣gan to enter into acquaintance with the <HI>Moralists,</HI> and had just receiv'd from them
<PB N="253" REF="397"/>
some cold consolation for the inconvenien∣cies of this life, and the incertainty of hu∣man affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to stop, and heard from the side of it the dreadful news of a sick Woman preparing to enter it. 'Tis not easy to guess at my mortification, but being so well fortify'd with Philosophy I stood resign'd with a Stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils, a sick Woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dress, that she was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no sooner was her hood remov'd, but I saw one of the finest faces I ever beheld, and to increase my surprize, heard her salute me by my name. I never had more reason to accuse Nature for making me short-sight∣ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well, and was utterly at a loss how to address myself; till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know (even before I discover'd my ignorance) that she was the daughter of one in our Neigh∣bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been consulting her Physicians in Town, was re∣turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you must know, has sometimes recommended the Study of Phy∣sick to me, but I never had any ambition
<PB N="254" REF="398"/>
to be a Doctor till this instant. I ventur'd to prescribe some Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid∣den her by her Doctors, she had the more inclination to. In short, I tempted, and she eat; nor was I more like the Devil than she like <HI>Eve.</HI> Having the good success of the 'foresaid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in spite of my evil Form accosted her with all the Gaiety I was master of; which had so good effect, that in less than an hour she grew pleasant, her colour return'd, and she was pleas'd to say my prescription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the pleasantest journey imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has some∣thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol∣lows as the greatest of truths, That I think myself extremely oblig'd by you in all points, especially for your kind and ho∣nourable Information and Advice in a mat∣ter of the utmost concern to me, which I shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship, justice, and sin∣cerity. At the same time be assur'd, that Gentleman we spoke of, shall never by any alteration in me discover my knowledge of his Mistake: the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of Return I can possibly
<PB N="255" REF="399"/>
make him for so many favours. And I may derive this pleasure at least from it, that whereas I must otherwise have been a little uneasy to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations; I may now, by bearing his Frailty, exercise my Grati∣tude and Friendship more than Himself either is, or perhaps ever will be sensible of.<Q><L>Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, Amores</L>

<P>But in one thing, I must confess you have yourself oblig'd me more than any man, which is, that you have shew'd me many of my Faults, to which as you are the more an implacable Enemy, by so much the more you are a kind Friend to me. I cou'd be proud, in revenge, to find a few slips in your Verses, which I read in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and since in the Country with more ap∣plication and pleasure: the thoughts are ve∣ry just, and you are sure not to let them suffer by the Versification. If you wou'd oblige me with the trust of any thing of yours, I shou'd be glad to execute any com∣missions you wou'd give me concerning them.

<P>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your Good-nature, the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet, which is one blessing Good-nature shou'd indispensably receive from mankind, in re∣turn for those many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in speaking well of me in my absence; the only thing by which
<PB N="258" REF="402"/>
you prove yourself no Wit or Critic: Tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will show just as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am absent, as he does severity to 'em when I am present. To be very frank with you, Sir, I must own, that where I receiv'd so much Civility at first, I cou'd hardly have expected so much Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wish, that the last were but equal to the first, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, so you wou'd omit nothing to improve me.</P>
<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en∣quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your speculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-house, and bidding adieu for some time to all the <HI>Rehearsals, Reviews, Ga∣zettes,</HI> &amp;c. have march'd off into <HI>Lin∣colnshire.</HI> Thus I find you vary your life in the scene at least, tho' not in the Action; for tho' life for the most part, like an old Play, be still the same, yet no w and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining. As for myself, I would not have my life a very regular Play, let it be a good mery Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other side) I wou'd as soon write like <HI>Durfey,</HI> as live like <HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e;</HI> whose beastly, yet
<PB N="259" REF="403"/>
merry life, is (if you will excuse such a si∣militude) not unlike a F--t, at once nasty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of these: every Actor is much better known by his having the same Face, than by keeping the same Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was yesterday <HI>Caesar,</HI> is to day Sir <HI>John Daw.</HI> So that one might ask the same question of a mo∣dern life, that <HI>Rich</HI> did of a modern play; <Q><L>" Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me;</L><L>" Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?</L></Q></P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be∣cause I persuade myself it might be useful, at a time when we have no other Theatre, to divert ourselves at this great one. Here is a glorious standing Comedy of Fools, at which every man is heartily merry, and thinks himself an unconcern'd Spectator. This (to our singular comfort) neither my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen herself can ever shut up, or silence. While that of <HI>Drury</HI> (alas!) lies desolate, in the pro∣foundest peace: and the melancholy pro∣spect of the Nymphys yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no less moving than that of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Dames lamenting over their ruin'd <HI>Ilium!</HI> What now can they

hope, disposiess'd of their antient seats, but to serve as Captives to the insulting Victors of the <HI>Hay-market?</HI> The afflicted subjects of <HI>France</HI> do not, in our <HI>Post-man,</HI> so gnie∣vously deplore the obstinacy of their arbi∣trary Monarch, as these perishing people of <HI>Drury</HI> the obdurate heart of that <HI>Pharaoh, Rich,</HI> who like him, disdains all Proposals of peace and accommodation. Several Li∣bels have been secretly affix'd to the great gates of his imperial palace in <HI>Bridges-street;</HI> and a Memorial representing the distresses of these persons, has been accidentally dropt (as we are credibly inform'd by a person of quality) out of his first Minister the chief Box-keeper's pocket, at a late Conference of the said Person of quality and others, on the part of the Confederates, and his Theatrical Majesty on his own part. Of this you may expect a copy as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congress, it is here reported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of
so many wretched Ladies may induce this haughty Prince to reason.</P>

<P>I MAY truly say I am more oblig'd to you this summer than to any of my Acquaintance, for had it not been for the two kind letters you sent me, I had been perfectly, <HI>oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis.</HI> The only companions I had were those Muses of whom <HI>Tully</HI> says, <HI>Adole∣scentiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rustican∣tur.</HI> Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them; for the Muses, if you take them as Companions, are ve∣ry pleasant and agreeable; but whoever should be forc'd to live or depend up∣on 'em, would find himself in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which <HI>Cowley</HI> calls the <HI>Companion of Obscurity,</HI> was not want∣ing to me, unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess I had for our Friend's welfare. 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an∣xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<PB N="262" REF="406"/>
silence. However the love of some things rewards itself, as of Virtue, and of Mr. <HI>Wy∣cherley.</HI> I am surpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and must agree with you, that our nation would have lost in him alone, more wit and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the rest of it. My concern for his friendship will excuse me, (since I know you honour him so much, and since you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my uneasiness to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> which I fear may have had some effect upon him. If so, he will have a greater punishment for his credulity than I cou'd wish him, in that fellow's acquain∣tance. The loss of a faithful creature is something, tho' of ever so contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for such a Man as the aforesaid, I shou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as constantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> in the Town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a worse subject which my spleen tempts me to, I will give you some account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, since <HI>Montaigne</HI> (to whom I am but a Dog
<PB N="263" REF="407"/>
in comparison) has done the very same thing of his Cat. <HI>Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam?</HI> You are to know then, that as 'tis Likeness begets affection, so my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the finest shap'd. He is not much a Spa∣niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb surly sort of kindness, that rather shows itself when he thinks me ill∣us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by ourselves. If it be the chief point of Friendship to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he pos∣sesses this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I sit, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witness our walk a year ago in St. <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park.</HI>—Histories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not insist upon ma∣ny of 'em, because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of <HI>Pylades</HI> and <HI>Orestes,</HI> &amp;c. I will only say for the ho∣nour of Dogs, that the two most antient and esteemable books sacred and prophane extant, (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI>) have shewn a particular regard to these animals. That of <HI>Toby</HI> is the more remarkable, be∣cause there was no manner of reason to take notice of the Dog, besides the great hu∣manity
<PB N="264" REF="408"/>
of the Author. <HI>Homer</HI>'s account of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Dog <HI>Argus</HI> is the most pathe∣tick imaginable, all the Circumstances con∣sider'd, and an excellent proof of the old Bard's Good-nature. <HI>Ulysses</HI> had left him at <HI>Ithaca</HI> when he embark'd for <HI>Troy,</HI> and found him at his return after twenty years, (which by the way is not unnatural as some Critics have said, since I remember the dam of my dog was twenty-two years old when she dy'd: May the omen of lon∣gaevity prove fortunate to her successor!) You shall have it in verse.</P>

<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> relating how the <HI>Athenians</HI> were oblig'd to abandon <HI>Athens</HI> in the time of <HI>Themistocles,</HI> steps back again out of the way of his History, purely to describe the lamen∣table cries and howlings of the poor Dogs they left behind.

A modern instance of gratitude to a Dog (tho' we have but few such) is, that the chief Order of <HI>Denmark</HI> (now injuriously call'd the Order of the <HI>Elephant</HI>) was instituted in memory of the fidelity of a dog nam'd <HI>Wild-brat,</HI> to one of their Kings who had been deserted

<P>AFTER I had recover'd from a dan∣gerous Illness which was first con∣tracted in Town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I troubled you with a letter, and a paper inclos'd, which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last I saw you, promising me in return some translations of yours from <HI>Ovid.</HI> Since when, I have not had a syllable from your hands, so that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have esca∣ped Death, I have not Oblivion. I shou'd at least have expected you to have finish'd that Elegy upon me, which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when I was sick in <HI>London;</HI> if you will but do so much for me first, I will give you leave to forget me afterwards; and for my own part will die at discretion, and at my leisure. But I fear I must be forc'd like many learn∣ed Authors, to write my own Epitaph, if I wou'd be remember'd at all. <HI>Monsieur de la Fontaine</HI>'s wou'd fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of Sacrilege, (do you think it is not?) to steal Epitaphs. In my present, living dead condition, nothing wou'd be properer than <HI>Oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis,</HI> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civilities I receiv'd from yourself,

and some others. They say indeed 'tis one quality of generous minds to forget the ob∣ligations they have conserr'd, and perhaps too it may be so to forget those on whom they conferr'd 'em? Then indeed I must be forgotten to all intents and purposes! I am, it must be own'd, dead in a natural ca∣pacity, according to Mr. <HI>Bickerstaff;</HI> dead in a poetical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity, as a useless member of the Common-wealth. But re∣flect, dear Sir, what melancholy effects may ensue, if Dead men are not civil to one ano∣ther? If he who has nothing to do him∣self, will not comfort and support another in his Idleness? If those who are to die themselves, will not now and then pay the charity of visiting a Tomb and a dead friend, and strowing a sew flow'rs over him? In the shades where I am, the Inhabitants have a mutual compassion for each other: Being all alike <HI>Inanes,</HI> and <HI>Umbratiles,</HI> we saunter to one another's habitations, and daily assist each other in doing nothing at all; this I mention for your edification and example, that <HI>Tout plein du vie</HI> as you are, yet you may not sometimes disdain—<HI>desipere in loco.</HI> Tho' you are no Papist, and have not so much regard to the dead as to address yourself to them, (which I plainly perceive by your si∣lence) yet I hope you are not one of those

<P>'TIS very natural for a young Friend, and a young Lover, to think the persons they love have nothing to do but to please them; when perhaps they, for their parts, had twenty other engagements before. This was my case when I wonder'd I did not hear from you; but I no sooner receiv'd your short letter, but I forgot your long silence; and so many fine things as you said of me cou'd not but have wrought a cure on my own Sickness, if it had not been of the nature of that, which is deaf to the Voice of the Charmer.

cou'd have better tim'd your compliment on my Philosophy; it was certainly properest to commend me for it just when I most needed it, and when I cou'd least be proud of it; that is, when I was in pain. 'Tis not easy to express what an exaltation it gave to my Spirits, above all the cordials of my Doctor; and 'tis no compliment to tell you, that your Compliments were sweeter than the sweetest of his Juleps and Syrups.

<P>Nevertheless I wou'd not have you entirely lay aside the thoughts of my Epitaph, any more than I do those of the probabili∣ty of my becoming (ere long) the subject of one. For Death has of late been very familiar with some of my Size; I am told my Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Litton</HI> are gone before me; and tho' I may now without vanity esteem myself the least thing like a man in <HI>England,</HI> yet I can't but be sorry, two Heroes of such a make shou'd die in∣glorious in their beds; when it had been a

fate more worthy our size, had they met with theirs from an irruption of Cranes, or other warlike Animals, those antient ene∣mies to our <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Ancestors! You of a superior species little regard what befals us <HI>Homunciolos Sesquipedales;</HI> however you have no reason to be so unconcern'd, since all Phy∣sicians agree there is no greater sign of a Plague among Men, than a Mortality among Frogs. I was the other day in company with a Lady, who rally'd my Person so much, as to cause a total subversion of my counte∣nance: Some days after, to be reveng'd on her, I presented her among other company the following <HI>Rondeau</HI> on that occasion, which I desire you to show <HI>Sapho.</HI><Q><LG>

This sort of writing call'd the <HI>Rondeau</HI> is what I never knew practis'd in our Nation, and I verily believe it was not in use with the <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> neither <HI>Macrobius</HI> nor <HI>Hyginus</HI> taking the least notice of it. 'Tis to be observ'd, that the vulgar spelling and pronouncing it <HI>Round O,</HI> is a manifest Cor∣ruption, and by no means to be allow'd of by Critics. Some may mistakenly imagine that it was a sort of <HI>Rondeau</HI> which the <HI>Gallick</HI> Soldiers sung in <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Triumph over <HI>Gaul—Gallias Caesar subegit,</HI> &amp;c. as it is re∣corded by <HI>Suetonius</HI> in <HI>Julio,</HI> and so derive its original from the antient <HI>Gauls</HI> to the modern <HI>French:</HI> but this is erroneous; the words there not being rang'd according to the Laws of the <HI>Rondeau,</HI> as laid down by <HI>Clement Marot.</HI> If you will say, that the Song of the Soldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of Poem, and so consequently imperfect, neither <HI>Heinsius</HI> nor I can be of that opinion; and so I conclude, that we know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I ask your pardon for all this Buffoonry, which I could not address to any one so well as to you, since I have found by experience, you most easily forgive my impertinencies.

<P>AT last I have prevail'd over a lazy hu∣mour to transcribe this Elegy: I have chang'd the situation of some of the <HI>Latin</HI> Verses, and made some Interpola∣tions, but I hope they are not absurd, and foreign to my author's sense and manner; but they are refer'd to your censure, as a debt; whom I esteem no less a Critic than a Poet: I expect to be treated with the same rigour as I have practis'd to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> and you,

<P>I Give you thanks for the Version you sent me of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeableness that charms us without correctness, like a mistress whose faults we see, but love her with them all. You have very judiciously alter'd his method in some places, and I can find nothing which I dare insist upon as an error: What I have written in the margins being merely Guesses at a little improvement, rather than Criti∣cisms. I assure you I do not expect you shou'd subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge 'em agreeable to rea∣son and good sense. What I have done is not as a Critic, but as a Friend; I know too well how many qualities are requisite to make up the one, and that I want almost all
<PB N="279" REF="423"/>
I can reckon up; but I am sure I do not want inclination, nor I hope capacity, to be the other. Nor shall I take it at all amiss, that another dissents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in understanding, he becomes the more eve∣ry day a critic upon himself, and finds something or other still to blame in his for∣mer notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad to know if you have translated the 11th Ele∣gy of <HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Ad amican navigantem,</HI> the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book 3, which are above all others my particular favou∣rites, especially the last of these.</P>
<P>As to the passage of which you ask my opinion in the second <HI>Aeneid,</HI> it is either so plain as to require no solution; or else (which is very probable) you see farther into it than I can. <HI>Priam</HI> wou'd say, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>Achilles</HI> (whom surely you only feign to be your Father, since your actions are so different from his) did not use me thus inhuman∣ly. He blush'd at his murder of <HI>Hector</HI> when he saw my sorrows for him; and restor'd his dead body to me to be buried."</Q> To this the answer of <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> seems to be agreeable enough. <Q REND="inline">"Go then to the shades, and tell <HI>Achilles</HI> how I degenerate from him:"</Q> granting the truth of what <HI>Priam</HI> had said of the difference between them.
<PB N="280" REF="424"/>
Indeed Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s mentioning here what <HI>Virgil</HI> more judiciously passes in silence, the circumstance of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s selling <HI>for mony</HI> the body of <HI>Hector,</HI> seems not so proper; it in some measure less'ning the character of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s generosity and piety, which is the very point of which <HI>Priam</HI> endeavours in this place to convince his Son, and to re∣proach him with the want of. But the truth of this Circumstance is no way to be que∣stion'd being expresly taken from <HI>Homer,</HI> who represents <HI>Achilles</HI> weeping for <HI>Priam,</HI> yet receiving the gold, <HI>Iliad</HI> 24: For when he gives the body, he uses these words, <Q REND="inline">"O my friend <HI>Patroclus!</HI> forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ransom for it, which I will bestow upon thy funeral."</Q></P>

<P>YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement, utterly forgot∣ten of all his Friends but you; for since Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> left <HI>London,</HI> I have not heard a word from him; tho' just before, and once since, I writ to him, and tho' I know my∣self guilty of no offence but of doing sin∣cerely just what he <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Correcting his Verses.

In what I sent you some time ago, you have not verse enough to be severe upon, in revenge for my last criticism: In one point I must persist, that is to say, my dislike of your <HI>Paradise,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="427"/>
in which I take no pleasure; I know very well that in <HI>Greek</HI> 'tis not only us'd by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> but is a common word for any Garden; but in <HI>English</HI> it bears the signifi∣cation and conveys the idea of <HI>Eden,</HI> which alone is (I think) a reason against making <HI>Ovid</HI> use it; who will be thought to talk too like a Christian in your version at least, whatever it might have been in <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek.</HI> As for all the rest of my Remarks, since you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon 'em (as I think I told you before) and in particular in the point of <HI>Trees enjoying,</HI> you have, I must own, sully satisfy'd me that the Expression is not only defensible, but beauti∣ful. I shall be very glad to see your Transla∣tion of the Elegy, <HI>Ad Amicam navigantem,</HI> as soon as you can; for (without a compli∣ment to you) every thing you write either in verse or prose, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing) that I will never be unsincere, tho' I may be often mistaken. To use Sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have experienc'd so much of it; and I need not tell you how much I really esteem you, when I esteem nothing in the world so much as that Quality. I know you sometimes say civil things to me in your Epistolary Style, but those I am to make al∣lowance

for, as particularly when you talk of <HI>Admiring;</HI> 'tis a word you are so us'd to in conversation of Ladies, that it will creep in to your discourse in spite of you, ev'n to your Friends. But as Women when they think themselves secure of admiration, com∣mit a thousand Negligences, which show them so much at disadvantage and off their guard, as to lose the little real Love they had before: so when men imagine others entertain some esteem for their abilities, they often expose all their Imperfections and foolish works, to the disparagement of the little Wit they were thought masters of. I am going to exem∣plify this to you, in putting into your hands (being encourag'd by so much indulgence) some verses of my Youth, or rather Child∣hood; which (as I was a great admirer of <HI>Waller</HI>) were intended in imitation of his manner; and are perhaps, such imitations, as those you see in awkward country Dames of the fine and well-bred Ladies of the Court.

But my almost continual Ill∣nesses prevent that, as well as most o∣ther satisfactions of my life: However I may say one good thing of sickness, that it is the best Cure in nature for Ambition, and designs upon the World or Fortune: It makes a man pretty indifferent for the future, provided he can but be easy, by intervals, for the present.

<P>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for Pastoral, espe∣cially being put into the mouth of a Shep∣herd, as they are here; in the Poet's own person they had been (I believe) more pro∣per.

imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <HI>Tatler,</HI> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a small copy of the same Author publish'd in the <HI>Tatler</HI> N<SUP>o</SUP> 12. on the <HI>Danish</HI> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint∣ing, and I recommend it to your per∣usal.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Garth</HI>'s Poem I have not seen, but believe I shall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <HI>Will</HI>'s, who swore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of swear∣ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more safely when they commend, than when they blame.</P>
<P>I agree with you in your censure of the use of <HI>Sea-terms</HI> in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Virgil;</HI> not only because <HI>Helenus</HI> was no great Pro∣phet in those matters, but because no Terms of Art or Cant-Words suit with the Ma∣jesty and dignity of Style which <HI>Epic</HI> Poetry requires.—<HI>Cui mens divinior atque os magna soniturum.</HI>—The Tarpawlin Phrase can please none but such <HI>Qui aurem habent Batavam;</HI> they must not expect <HI>Au∣ribus Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phrases of <HI>Martial</HI> here very dexterously.)</P>
<P>Tho' you say you did not rightly take my Meaning in the verse I quoted from <HI>Juve∣nal,</HI> yet I will not explain it; because tho' it seems you are resolv'd to take me for a
<PB N="291" REF="435"/>
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a Commentator.—And for another reason too, because I have quite forgot both the Verse and the Application.</P>
<P>I hope it will be no offence to give my most hearty service to Mr. <HI>Wycherley,</HI> tho' I perceive by his last to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, since he there told me he was going instantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser∣vant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I guess by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, as∣sure him I have ever borne all the Re∣spect and Kindness imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has estrang'd him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more safely my friend, since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him. I cou'd not have thought any man had been so very cautious and suspi∣cious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to believe no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not so much of Honesty. There is but one way I know of conversing safely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we say or do, but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be con∣ceal'd, and I can truly boast this comfort in my affairs with Mr. <HI>Wycherley.</HI> But I par∣don

<P>I have (as I think I formerly told you) a very good opinion of Mr. <HI>Row</HI>'s 9th book

of <HI>Lucan:</HI> Indeed he amplifies too much, as well as <HI>Brebaeus,</HI> the famous <HI>French</HI> imi∣tator.

<Q><L>Vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret</L>

no less than eight in <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>What you observe sure cannot be an <HI>Error Sphaericus,</HI> strictly speaking, either according to their <HI>Ptolomaick,</HI> or our <HI>Co∣pernican</HI> System; <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> himself will be on the Translator's side.

<P>You can't but have remark'd what a journey <HI>Lucan</HI> here makes <HI>Cato</HI> take for the sake of his fine Descriptions. From <HI>Cyrene</HI> he travels by land, for no better reason than this:

The Winter's effects on the Sea, it seems were more to be dreaded than all the Ser∣pents, Whirlwinds, Sands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Land, which immediately after he paints out in his speech to the soldiers: Then he fetches a compass a vast way round about, to the <HI>Nasamones</HI> and <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI>'s Temple, purely to ridicule the Oracles: And <HI>Labi∣enus</HI> must pardon me, if I do not believe him when he says—<HI>sors obtulit, &amp; fortuna viae</HI>—either <HI>Labienus</HI> or the Map, is very much mistaken here.

<P>THE System of <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> (were it true, as it is <HI>Novel</HI>) cou'd have no room here: <HI>Lucan,</HI> with the rest of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, seems to follow <HI>Plato;</HI> whose

order of the Spheres is clear in <HI>Cicero, De Natura Deorum, De somnio Scipionis,</HI> and in <HI>Macrobius.</HI> The Seat of the <HI>Semidei ma∣nes</HI> is <HI>Platonick</HI> too, for <HI>Apuleius de Deo Socratis</HI> assigns the same to the <HI>Genii, viz.</HI> the Region of the <HI>Air</HI> for their intercourse with Gods and Men; so that I fancy, <HI>Row</HI> mistook the situation, and I can't be re∣concil'd to, <HI>Look down on the Sun's Rays.</HI> I am glad you agree with me about the la∣titude he takes; and wish you had told me, if the <HI>sortilegi,</HI> and <HI>fatidici,</HI> cou'd licence his invectives against Priests? But I suppose you think them (with <HI>Helena</HI>) undeserving of your protection. I agree with you in <HI>Lucan</HI>'s Errors, and the cause of 'em, his Poetic descriptions: for the <HI>Romans</HI> then knew the coast of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Cyrene</HI> (to the South-east of which lies <HI>Ammon</HI> toward <HI>Egypt</HI>) to <HI>Leptis</HI> and <HI>Utica:</HI> But pray re∣member how your <HI>Homer</HI> nodded while <HI>Ulysses</HI> slept, and waking knew not where he was, in the short passage from <HI>Corcyra</HI> to <HI>Ithaca.</HI> I like <HI>Trapp</HI>'s Versions for their justness; his Psalm is excellent, the Prodi∣gies in the first <HI>Georgick</HI> judicious (whence I conclude that 'tis easier to turn <HI>Virgil</HI> justly in blank verse, than rhyme.)

<P>TO make use of that freedom and fa∣miliarity of style which we have ta∣ken up in our Correspondence, and which is more properly Talking upon paper, than Writing; I will tell you without any pre∣face, that I never took <HI>Tycho Brahe</HI> for one of the Antients, or in the least an acquain∣tance of <HI>Lucan</HI>'s; nay, 'tis a mercy on this occasion tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I do not give you an ac∣count of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Life and conversation; as how he liv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> some years like an inchanted Knight in a certain Island, with a tale of a King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Mistress that shall be nameless.—But I have compassion on you, and wou'd not for the world you shou'd

These coelestial thoughts put me in mind of the <HI>Priests</HI> you mention, who are a sort of <HI>Sortilegi</HI> in one sense, because in their Lottery there are more Blanks than Prizes; the Adventurers being at best in an uncertainty, whereas the Set∣ters-up are sure of something. Priests in∣deed in their Character, as they represent God, are sacred; and so are Constables as they represent the King, but you will own a great many of 'em are very odd fellows, and the devil a bit of likeness in 'em. Yet I can assure you, I honour the good as much as I detest the bad, and I think, that in condemning these, we praise those. I am so far from esteeming e'en the worst unworthy of my protection, that I have defended their Character (in <HI>Congreve</HI>'s and <HI>Vanbrugh</HI>'s Plays) ev'n against their own Brethren. And so much for Priests in general, now for <HI>Trapp</HI> in particular whose Translations from <HI>Ovid</HI> I have not so good an opinion of as you; not (I will assure you) from any sort of preju∣dice to him as a Priest, but because I

think he has little of the main Characte∣ristick of his Author, a graceful Easiness. For let the sense be ever so exactly ren∣der'd, unless an author looks like himself, in his air, habit, manner, 'tis a Disguise and not a Translation. But as to the Psalm, I think <HI>David</HI> is much more beholden to him than <HI>Ovid;</HI> and as he treated the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> like a <HI>Jew,</HI> so he has made the <HI>Jew</HI> speak like a <HI>Roman.</HI></P>

<P>IT seems that my late mention of <HI>Cra∣shaw,</HI> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curiosity. I therefore send you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of those whose works may just deserve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at leisure hours, and more to keep out of idleness, than to esta∣blish a reputation: so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him. All that regards Design, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex∣actness, or consent of parts, (which is the
<PB N="303" REF="447"/>
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret∣ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expressions, and something of a neat cast of Verse, (which are properly the dress, gems, or loose ornaments of Poetry) may be found in these verses. This is indeed the case of most other Poetical Writers of <HI>Miscellanies;</HI> nor can it well be otherwise, since no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diversion only. These Authors shou'd be consider'd as <HI>Versifiers</HI> and <HI>witty Men,</HI> rather than as <HI>Poets;</HI> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expression, and the Numbers. These are only the pleasing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to express myself like a Painter) their <HI>Colouring</HI> entertains the sight, but the <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of the Picture are not to be in∣spected too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd himself upon <HI>Pe∣trarch,</HI> or rather upon <HI>Marino.</HI> His thoughts one may observe, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often strain'd and stiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never so apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and inconsiderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than understood. This ambition of surprising a reader, is the true natural cause of all Fustian, or Bombast in
<PB N="304" REF="448"/>
Poetry. To confirm what I have said you need but look into his first Poem of the <HI>Weeper,</HI> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21st stanza's are as sublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d stanza's of the same copy, are soft and plea∣sing: And if these last want any thing, it is an easier and more unaffected expression. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been spared, being eihter but re∣petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest, to be like this; a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and sutiable expressions, of sorc'd and inextri∣cable conceits, and of needless fillers-up to the rest. From all which it is plain, this Author writ fast, and set down what came uppermost. A reader may skim off the froth, and use the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot∣tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <HI>own, natural, middle-way,</HI> is best.</P>
<P>To speak of his <HI>Numbers</HI> is a little diffi∣cult, they are so various and irregular, and mostly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Verse (the best example of which is his <HI>Musick</HI>'s <HI>Duel</HI>) is carelesly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<PB N="305" REF="449"/>
that had he taken more care, it had been musical and pleasing enough, not extreme∣ly majestic, but sweet: And the time con∣sider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un∣correct as he is) none of the worst Versifi∣cators.</P>
<P>I will just observe, that the best Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphrase on Psal. 23. On <HI>Lessius,</HI> Epitaph on Mr. <HI>Ashton,</HI> Wishes to his suppos'd Mistress, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

<P>I Resume my old liberty of throwing out myself upon paper to you, and ma∣king what thoughts float uppermost in my head, the subject of a letter. They are at present upon <HI>Laughter,</HI> which (for ought I know) may be the cause you might some∣times think me too remiss a friend, when I was most intirely so: for I am never so inclin'd to mirth as when I am most pleas'd and most easy, which is in the company of a friend like yourself.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="450"/>
As the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness, not disrespect, so is raillery with a friend. I know there are Prudes in friendship, who expect distance, awe and adoration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol∣worshipper, tho' a Papist. If I were to address <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself in a heathen way, I fancy I shou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like <HI>Dionysius;</HI> I was just going to say of his buttons, but I think <HI>Jupiter</HI> wore none (however I won't be positive to so nice a Critic as you, but his robe might be <HI>Subnected</HI> with a <HI>Fibula.</HI>) I know some Philosophers define Laughter, <HI>A recommend∣ing ourselves to our own favour, by compa∣rison with the weakness of another:</HI> but I am sure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe <HI>Children</HI> have any such consideration in their heads, when they ex∣press their pleasure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the most part, and as sillily. There is a difference too betwixt laughing <HI>about</HI> a thing and laugh∣ing <HI>at</HI> a thing: One may find the inferior Man (to make a kind of casuistical di∣stinction) provok'd to folly at the sight or observation of some <HI>circumstance of a thing,</HI> when the <HI>thing itself</HI> appears solemn and august to the superior Man, that is, our

Judgment and Reason. Let an Ambassador speak the best Sense in the world, and de∣port himself in the most graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the <HI>Tail</HI> of <HI>his Shirt</HI> happen (as I have known it happen to a very wise man) to hang out behind, more people shall laugh at that than attend to the other; till they recollect themselves, and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the Minister. I must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you; several Muscles of my Face sometimes take an impertinent liberty with my Judgment, but then my Judgment soon rises, and sets all right again about my mouth: And I find I value no man so much, as he in whose sight I have been playing the fool. I cannot be <HI>Sub-Persona</HI> before a man I love; and not to laugh with honesty, when Nature prompts, or Folly (which is more a second Nature than any thing I know) is but a knavish hypocritical way of ma∣king a mask of one's own Face.—To conclude, those that are my friends I <HI>laugh with,</HI> and those that are not I <HI>laugh at;</HI> so am merry in company, and if ever I am wise, it is all by myself. You take just another course, and to those that are not your friends, are very civil, and to those that are, very endearing and complaisant: Thus when you and I meet, there will be

Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> came to town on <HI>Sunday</HI> last, and kindly surpriz'd me with a visit on <HI>Monday</HI> morning. We din'd and drank together; and I saying, <HI>To our Loves,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>'Tis Mr.</HI> Pope<HI>'s health:</HI> He said he would go to Mr. <HI>Tho∣rold</HI>'s and leave a letter for you. Tho' I cannot answer for the event of all this, in

<P>I Receiv'd the entertainment of your Let∣ter the day after I had sent you one of mine, and I am but this morning return'd hither. The news you tell me of the ma∣ny difficulties you found in your return from <HI>Bath,</HI> gives me such a kind of plea∣sure as we usually take in accompanying our Friends in their mixt adventures; for me∣thinks I see you labouring thro' all your inconveniencies of the rough roads, the hard saddle, the trotting horse, and what not? What an agreeable surprize wou'd it have been to me, to have met you by pure accident, (which I was within an ace of doing) and to have carry'd you off triumphantly, set you on an easier Pad, and reliev'd the wandring Knight with a Night's lodging and rural Repast, at our Castle in the Forest? But these are only
<PB N="311" REF="455"/>
the pleasing Imaginations of a disappointed Lover, who must suffer in a melancholy absence yet these two months. In the mean time, I take up with the Muses for want of your better company; the Muses, <HI>Quae nobiscum pernoctant, peregrinantur, rustican∣tur.</HI> Those aerial Ladies just discover e∣nough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit, and draw me on in a wand'ring Maze of thought, still in hopes (and only in hopes) of attaining those favours from 'em, which they confer on their more happy Admirers. We grasp some more beautiful Idea in our own brain, than our endeavours to express it can set to the view of others; and still do but la∣bour to fall short of our first Imagina∣tion. The gay Colouring which Fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it, goes off in the Execution; like those various figures in the gilded clouds which while we gaze long upon, to separate the parts of each imaginary Image, the whole faints before the eye and decays into confu∣sion.</P>
<P>I am highly pleas'd with the knowledge you give me of Mr <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s present temper, which seems so favourable to me. I shall ever have such a Fund of Affection for him as to be agreeable to myself when I am so to him, and cannot but be
<PB N="312" REF="456"/>
gay when he's in good humour, as the surface of the Earth (if you will pardon a poetical similitude) is clearer or gloomier, just as the Sun is brighter, or more over∣cast.—I should be glad to see the Ver∣ses to <HI>Lintot</HI> which you mention, for me∣thinks something oddly agreeable may be produc'd from that subject.—For what remains, I am so well, that nothing but the assurance of your being so can make me better; and if you wou'd have me live with any satisfaction these dark days in which I cannot see you, it must be by your writing sometimes to</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Wycherley</HI> has, I believe sent you two or three letters of invitation; but you, like the Fair, will be long solli∣cited before you yield, to make the favour the more acceptable to the Lover. He is much yours by his talk; for that unbound∣ed Genius which has rang'd at large like a libertine, now seems confin'd to you:
<PB N="313" REF="457"/>
and I shou'd take him for your Mistress too by your simile of the Sun and Earth: 'Tis very fine, but inverted by the application; for the gaiety of your fancy, and the droop∣ing of his by the withdrawing of your lustre, perswades me it wou'd be juster by the reverse. Oh happy Favourite of the Muses! how <HI>per-noctare,</HI> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but skirmish with them, and decline a close Engagement. Leave Elegy and Translation to the inferior Class, on whom the Muses only glance now and then like our Win∣ter-Sun, and then leave 'em in the dark. Think on the Dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater Poetry, as <HI>Dennis</HI> says, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Criticism. Every one wonders that a Genius like yours will not support the sinking <HI>Drama;</HI> and Mr <HI>Wilks</HI> (tho' I think his Talent is Comedy) has express'd a furious ambition to swell in your Buskins. We have had a poor Comedy of <HI>John∣son</HI>'s (not <HI>Ben</HI>) which held seven nights, and has got him three hundred pounds, for the Town is sharp-set on new Plays. In vain wou'd I fire you by Interest or Ambi∣tion, when your mind is not susceptible of either; tho' your Authority (arising from the General esteem, like that of <HI>Pompey</HI>) must infallibly assure you of success; for

<P>IF I have not writ to you so soon as I ought, let my writing now attone for the delay; as it will infallibly do, when you know what a Sacrifice I make you at this time, and that every moment my eyes are employ'd upon this paper, they are ta∣ken off from two of the finest Faces in the universe. But indeed 'tis some consolation to me to reflect, that while I but write this period. I escape some hundred fatal Darts from those unerring Eyes, and about a thousand Deaths, or better. Now you, that delight in dying, wou'd not once have dreamt of an absent Friend in these cir∣cumstances; you that are so nice an Admi∣rer of Beauty, or (as a Critic wou'd say af∣ter <HI>Terence</HI>) <HI>so elegant a Spectator of Forms:</HI> You must have a sober dish of Coffee, and a solitary candle at your side, to write an Epistle Lucubratory to your friend; where∣as I can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights, that out-shine the golden God

of Day and silver Goddess of Night with all the refulgent Eyes of the Firmament.—You fancy now that <HI>Sapho</HI>'s eyes are two of these my Tapers, but it is no such mat∣ter, Sir; these are eyes that have more per∣swasion in one glance than all <HI>Sapho</HI>'s Ora∣tory and Gesture together, let her put her body into what moving postures she pleases. Indeed, indeed, my friend, you cou'd ne∣ver have found so improper a time to tempt me with Interest or Ambition: let me but have the Reputation of these in my keeping, and as for my own, let the De∣vil, or let <HI>Dennis,</HI> take it for ever. How gladly wou'd I give all I am worth, that is to say, my <HI>Pastorals</HI> for one of them, and my <HI>Essay</HI> for the other? I wou'd lay out all my <HI>Poetry</HI> in <HI>Love;</HI> an <HI>Original</HI> for a <HI>Lady,</HI> and a <HI>Translation</HI> for a <HI>wait∣ing Maid!</HI> alas! what have I to do with <HI>Jane Grey,</HI> as long as Miss <HI>Molly,</HI> Miss <HI>Betty,</HI> or Miss <HI>Patty</HI> are in this world? Shall I write of <HI>Beauties murder'd long ago,</HI> when there are those at this instant that <HI>murder me?</HI> I'll e'en compose my own Tra∣gedy, and the Poet shall appear in his own person to move Compassion: 'Twill be far more effectual than <HI>Bays</HI>'s entring with a rope about his neck, and the world will own, there never was a more miserable Ob∣ject brought upon the Stage.</P>

Now you that are a Critic, pray inform me, in what manner I may connect the foregoing part of this Letter with that which is to follow, according to the Rules? I would willingly return Mr <HI>Gay</HI> my thanks for the favour of his Poem, and in parti∣cular for his kind mention of me; I hop'd, when I heard a new Comedy had met with success upon the Stage, that it had been his, to which I really wish no less; and (had it been any way in my power) should have been very glad to have contributed to it's Introduction into the world. His <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Receipt to make a Miscellany.</NOTE>Ver∣ses to <HI>Lintot</HI> have put a whim into my head, which you are like to be troubled with in the opposite page<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Copy of Verses will be found in our second Volume.</NOTE>. Take it as you find it, the production of half an hour t'o∣ther morning. I design very soon to put a task of a more serious nature upon you, in reviewing a piece of mine that may better deserve Criticism; and by that time you have done with it, I hope to tell you in person with how much fidelity I am,</P>
