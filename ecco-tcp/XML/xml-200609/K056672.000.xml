<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
Treaty of Commerce
WITH
FRANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is in vain to make Complaints of
the Iniquity of the Times; and
make a long Introduction to blame
the People for the Humour that at
present, like a Contagion, infects the
Nation, and spreads it self Universally
into all Conversation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of finding
Fault with, and Condemning every pub∣lick
Transaction, before they Weigh or
Consider the Reason and Nature of the
thing. It is enough to sit down and
look on it with regret, and with a just
Pity for the Distempers of our Native
Country, apply suitable Remedies for
the use of such as are not Incurable, and
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
for the opening the Eyes of those who
are not wilfully and resolutely blind;
leaving the rest, as the Parishes used to
do Houses shut up with the Plague, to
their own Fate, with <HI>Lord ha' Mercy and
a Cross</HI> set upon the Door.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Commerce made with
<HI>France,</HI> is the present Subject of every
Man's Discourse, and it were to be wish∣ed
People came to the Reading it with
less resolution to Dislike it beforehand
than they do, or at least with a just reso∣lution
to Read and Consider it, before
they passed their judgment for or against;
but since that cannot be hoped for in this
Age, it may not be a useless endeavour
to open the Eyes of some misguided mis∣taken
People, about such things in the
said Treaty, which they may either on
one side or other Causelesly Condemn,
or too easily approve. That things being
set in a true light, every Man may Rea∣son
with himself calmly of this matter;
for certainly a thing of this Consequence
ought to be Duly weigh'd, and Cooly
Debated, before we come to make such
Conclusions as are to Determine our judg∣ments,
both of the Treaty made, and of
those that made it.</P>
<P>To Do this as it ought to be done, it
seems needful to enquire a little into the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
state of our Commerce with <HI>France</HI> be∣fore
the War began, that People may a
little know upon what Foundation things
formerly stood, and may accordingly
judge whether we are better or worse
than we were before.</P>
<P>We are told in the Treaty of a General
TARIF, that is, an Act of Trade
made in the Year 1664, by the <HI>French</HI>;
by this, some People understand a Treaty
of Commerce formerly made between
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> which is a general
mistake, and which mistake ought to be
set right, the Words themselves explain
it, <HI>a Tarif made in</HI> France, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
Treaty) by which is to be understood,
a Table or Decree of the several Impo∣sitions
and Prohibitions, made by the
King of <HI>France,</HI> for the Regulation
of his own Subjects, declaring what
Goods shall be Imported into <HI>France,</HI> and
from what Countries, and what shall
not be Imported, and what Customs
or Duties shall be paid in <HI>France</HI> upon
those Goods which are allow'd to be Im∣ported;
something like our act of Na∣vigation,
allowing for the difference of
the Subject only.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dutch</HI> have entred into any
Treaty of Commerce with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they
have grounded those Treaties with re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pect
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
to their Liberty of Trading into <HI>France,</HI>
upon that Tarif of 1664, <HI>that is to say,</HI>
They have declared themselves Content
with those Conditions of Trade, and have
only Articled that they should not be o∣therwise
obstructed; and therefore we
found that in all the Transactions at
<HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were Insisting
on the particulars of their Trade to <HI>France,</HI>
it was call'd, <HI>The</HI> French <HI>granting</HI> them
the Tarif of 1664, that is, <HI>granting</HI>
that no other Impositions or Prohibitions
should be laid upon them in <HI>France,</HI> than
that Act of Trade had formerly laid.</P>
<P>Pursuant to this Notion, we never find
any of our former Treaties with <HI>France</HI>
make the least mention of these things,
since admitting or not admitting the
Importation of Goods and Merchandizes
into a Kingdom, is the undoubted Pro∣perty
and Right of the Sovereign Power
or Government of that Kingdom, much
more the determining what Duties, Pay∣ments,
or Impositions, shall be charged
upon the respective Goods brought in;
which Payments and Duties being paid
by the People of the said Nation who
Import, no other Nation can Object a∣gainst
them.</P>
<P>And therefore we find in all our for∣mer
Treaties, nothing of this nature has
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
been entred into at all: The first Treaty
of Peace between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
after the Restoration, was the Treaty of
<HI>Breda, Anno</HI> 1667. wherein all that is
said of this matter, is in the Fourth Ar∣ticle,
thus, <Q REND="inline">"Navigation and Commerce
shall be Free between the Subjects of
both the Kings, as it was during the
Peace, insomuch that all of them may
Freely, and without any Molestation.
go with their Goods into each others
Kingdoms, Provinces, Places of Com∣merce,
Ports, Rivers, and there stay
and Traffick." <BIBL><HI>Vide</HI> Treaty of <HI>Breda.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the <HI>Feburary</HI> following, there was a
Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> con∣cluded
at St. <HI>Germans on Lay,</HI> the late
Duke of <HI>Montague,</HI> being then the <HI>English</HI>
Ambassador in <HI>France,</HI> and this is call'd
a Treaty of Commerce; yet from one
end to the other, there is not one Word
mention'd in it of the Duties paid or to
be paid in either Kingdom by the Mer∣chants;
as what really was the peculiar
of every Prince or Sovereign Power
in their respective Dominions; and there∣fore
tho' this Treaty is called a Treaty of
Commerce, it ought rather to have been
call'd a Treaty of Navigation, every Ar∣ticle
therein respecting the Navigation of
Ships, Freedom of Ports, Visiting Ships,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
adjustitg what are, and what are not
Contraband Goods, Terminating Differ∣ences
about Passports, detaining Vessels,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> what Goods are liable to Forfeiture,
and how to be Seiz'd, and the like; but
not a Word about Tolls, Customs, Du∣ties,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon Importation.</P>
<P>The next Treaty, was that of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
where the <HI>Dutch</HI> were only immediately
concern'd, and a Treaty of Commerce
was likewise settled then, between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Holland, Anno</HI> 1678, but even in
this Treaty we have not a Word relating
to what Duties or Imposits the <HI>French</HI>
should lay upon Goods Imported into
<HI>France,</HI> except as follows. <Q REND="inline">"Neither
Party shall be permitted to grant to
their own Subjects any Immunities,
Benefits, Gratuitous Concessions, or
any other Advantages, besides those
granted to the Subjects of the other
Party, or to their prejudice, neither
shall the Subjects on either side be
bound to pay greater or other Duties,
Charges, Payments, or Impostions
whatsoever upon their Persons, Goods,
Wares, Ships, or Freights, directly, or
indirectly, by any Name, or under
any Title, or Pretence whatsoever
other than such as shall be paid by the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
proper and natural Subjects of either
Party." <P><BIBL>Vide Treaty of Commerce at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI>
Article 7.</BIBL></P></Q></P>
<P>The only Remedy, in all these Cases,
that has been used by these several Na∣tions,
has been, that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> laid high Duties upon the Goods im∣ported,
or Ships Importing, from another,
or Prohibited the Importing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and
such Goods, or stop'd Trade with the o∣ther,
the other Nation con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the
like, and these Impositio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and Interruptions of Commerce were
generally taken off, at the concluding a
Peace, tho' not always.</P>
<P>Thus when the <HI>French</HI> after their Ta∣rif
of 1664, laid a Duty of F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty <HI>Sols
per</HI> Tun, upon all Shipping that came
into their Harbours, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
highly by all the Trading part of <HI>Europe,</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Sweedes</HI> were very uneasy
at it, their Ships being large and the
Loading such as Timber, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>boards,
Planks, Baulks, Spars, <HI>&amp;c</HI> being of
but little value, it went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the
Freight, but they were of too small
Consquence to obtain any A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>eration in
<HI>France.</HI> The design of the <HI>French</HI> King be∣ing
Really very justifiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
difference to encourage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
to build Ships of their own, and fetch the
Goods themselves, in which Case they
went Free. The <HI>Dutch</HI> sollicited eagerly
to be exempted from this Duty, the
Trade they had with <HI>France</HI> being very
great, and carried on wholly in their
own Shipping, but they were so far from
obtaining an Exemption, that in the
Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a
separate Article, consented to pay that
Duty of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, as follows.
<Q REND="inline">'It hath been stipulated on the behalf
of his most Christian Majesty, and
consented to by the Lords the States-General
of the United Provinces of the
<HI>Low-Countries,</HI> That the Equality which
is precisely to be observ'd with relation
to the Subjects of each, and the Natives,
as to Duties, Charges, and Impositions,
according to the Seventh Article of
Treaty of Commerce this Day con∣cluded,
shall not derogate from the
Imposition of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, Im∣posed
in <HI>France</HI> upon Strangers Ships,
and that the Subjects of the Lords the
States-General of the United Provinces
of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> shall be bound
to pay the same as other Strangers.' <P><BIBL>Vide Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> separate Ar∣ticle</BIBL></P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
The <HI>English</HI> were as much concern'd
in this Imposition of Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Tun, as
any Nation, the <HI>Dutch</HI> excepted; but
seeing no just Foundation to object against
the reasonableness of the <HI>French</HI> laying
such an Imposition, and having by their
own Act, called, <HI>The Act of Navigation,</HI>
done almost the same thing, or in effect
worse, they contented themselves with
laying a like Duty of 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Tun, upon
all <HI>French</HI> Ships which should Lade in the
several Ports of <HI>England,</HI> and so it has
rested till this time.</P>
<P>The next Treaty of Peace was at <HI>Rys∣wick,</HI>
and in this <HI>England</HI> made no Treaty
of Commerce at all; It was indeed Ver∣bally
agreed, that Commissioners should
be appointed to meet afterwards to enter
into a Treaty of Commerce, and to settle
the Trade between the two Nations;
But as <HI>France</HI> did not seek it, and <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
thought they had no occasion for it,
the War also being very quickly renew∣ed,
that Proposal vanished.</P>
<P>Now to make way a little to the ex∣plaining
the present Article of Commerce
in debate, it may not be amiss to enquire
Why <HI>England</HI> was so indifferent at the late
Treaty at <HI>Ryswick,</HI> whether they entred
into a Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI>
or no? And if this thing be rightly Under∣stood,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
it will open the Eyes of many, if
not of every considering Person, to the
Justice, nay, to the Advantage to <HI>England,</HI>
by the present Article of the Treaty of
Commerce now made, which so many
complain of, and so few understand.</P>
<P>It is too well known, to need any De∣bate,
that <HI>England</HI> had for many Years,
we may say Ages, carried on the Trade
with <HI>France,</HI> with manifest disadvantages;
That by the prodigious quantity of Wines,
Brandies, Silks, Linnen, Paper, Glass,
and other Goods, which we greedlly
Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> the
Ballance of Trade went against us to a
very great yearly Sum; <HI>France</HI> having
used many ways to encourage the In∣dustry
of their own People in Woollen
Manufactures there, in order to lessen, as
much as might be, the demand they
might make from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When the War interven'd, <HI>England</HI>
by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>veral Acts of Parliament, laid Ex∣cessive
high Duties upon some of the
Goods usually Imported from <HI>France,</HI> e∣specially
Wine and Brandy, and others
were entirely prohibited to encourage
the <HI>English</HI> to pursue with Success the
Attempts they had made of setting up the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI> such as
Paper, Glass-Wares, Hats, Linnen,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Wrought Silks, and the like, these high
Duties and Prohibitions remain'd in Force
even when the War was at end; nor did
the restoring of Commerce in general
Terms by the Treaty of <HI>Ryswick</HI> alter the
Case at all.</P>
<P>It came immediately into Debate a∣mong
the Men of Trade, Whether the
<HI>French</HI> Trade was worth so much to us
as to make it worth while to open it at
the Expence of taking off those high
Duties and Prohibitions or no? And it ap∣peared
so evident that it was absolutely
necessary to keep on the high Duties, as
well to encourage the Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI>
from whence all our Wines came in re∣turn
for Woollen Manufactures; as also to
prevent the excessive Flux of <HI>French</HI> Wine
and Brandy to the over-ballancing the
Trade to <HI>France,</HI> as also to support our
several Manufactures of Silk, Glass, Pa∣per,
Wrought Linnen, Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
which we began to Improve, so as to be
likely in time, not to want any or those
Goods from <HI>France.</HI> I say this appeared
so evident, that no Man c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld think with
any Patience, of entring into any Treaty
of Commerce with <HI>France</HI>; but every one
was convinc'd, that it was necessary to
keep on the high Duties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to give the
Advantage to the other Trades above
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
named, and keep the <HI>French</HI> Trade under
foot.</P>
<P>Upon these accounts it was that no
Treaty ever came to any head with <HI>France</HI>
(notwithstanding Peace was made) for
the regulation of Commerce, and it was
apparent that <HI>England</HI> was in the right of
it at that time, for that in that Interval of
time, from the Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> to the
Commencement of the last War, the
<HI>French</HI> bought exceeding Great Quantities
of Goods from us, while we on the con∣trary
took but very few Goods of them
in Return, and the Ballance of Trade was
turn'd against <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This the <HI>French</HI> King was so sensible of,
That to give his People the Equivalent,
he made a new Tarif or Settlement of
Duties and Customs of Goods <HI>Anno</HI> 1699.
the same which is now mentioned in the
9th Article of the present Treaty, by
which some Goods he entirely Prohibit∣ed
from <HI>England,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) Red Herrings,
which when some of his own Merchants
Petitioned against, he answered wisely,
<HI>Is not the Sea open? If my Subjects want
Herrings let them Catch them, not Buy
them of others.</HI> Upon other Goods from
<HI>England</HI> he laid higher Duties than be∣fore,
especially our Woollen Manufa∣ctures,
supposing two things, (1.) That
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
it would encourage his own People
to make them at Home; and (2.)
might lead the <HI>English</HI> to open the Trade
for <HI>French</HI> Wines and Brandies, in order
to make way for the Trade of the Wool∣len
Manufactures again into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But this had no effect here; for the
Government here, who easily foresaw that
the Trade of our Woollen Manufactures
in <HI>France,</HI> was never equal to their Trade
of Wine and Brandy here, and that
the Channel of Trade was Happily
turn'd to our Advantage against <HI>France,</HI>
were far from enclining to alter it, and
thus the Notion of a Treaty of Com∣merce
was slighted as a thing <HI>France</HI>
might desire indeed, but we were better
without than with; And this was the
true Reason why it never came to a head.</P>
<P>Upon renewing the War, New Prohi∣bitions
of Commerce on both sides fol∣low'd
of Course, and to prevent the Wine
Trade falling in by private Methods, such
as Confiscation, Prize-taking and the like,
under which Heads, while the Duties were
low, great quantities of <HI>French</HI> Wine was
dayly brought, a new Duty additional
to the former was lay'd upon Wine and
Brandy, particularly 25 <HI>per</HI> Ton upon
the Wine, and <HI>per</HI> Ton upon the
Brandy, which amounted to a meer Pro∣hibition
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
except for a very small quantity,
so great an Advance of the Price reducing
the Consumption to almost nothing; and
the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines, a very profitable
Trade to <HI>England,</HI> became our general
Draught all over <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true state of the Affair of
Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
and thus Her Majesty found things when
her Ministers came at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> to Treat of
the Settling a New Treaty of Commerce,
and from Hence it will appear that the
Measures taken in the said Treaty, and
the Conditions agreed on relating to our
Manufactures in <HI>France,</HI> and their Wine
and Brandy in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and taking
off the Duty on either side, are not only
equal and just, but are founded on the
True Interest of Trade, and much more
to the advantage of <HI>Britain</HI> than of <HI>France,</HI>
as will appear, if the following Particu∣lars
are Impartially Considered.</P>
<P>Upon this New Treaty, after having
in General Agreed in the 6th Article, thus,
That <HI>the Subjects of each Party shall Pay the
Tolls, Customs and Duties of Import and Ex∣port
through all the Dminions and Provinces
of either Party, as are Due and Accustomed:</HI>
That is, as the Government of that respe∣ctive
Country shall Exact or legally Im∣pose.
And again in the 5th Article, <Q REND="inline">'That
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Subjects of each of their Royal Majesties
may have Leave and Licence, to come
with their Ships, as also with the Mer∣chandizes
and Goods on Board the same
(the Trade and Importation where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are
not prohibited by the Laws of either
Kingdom) to the Lands, Countries, Ci∣ties,
Ports, Places and Rivers of either
side.'</Q></P>
<P>This again allows that either Nation
may Make, and Continue such Prohibi∣tions
of Trade as they think fit, without
any Infringement of the Peace. Indeed
the Nature of the Thing implies that
they should and ought to do so; for every
Country is judge for themselves, what it
is they ought to Admit, and what to
Prohibit.</P>
<P>The Ministers of <HI>England</HI> then finding
the High Duties necessary to be Continued
upon Wine and Brandy, at least to a certain
Degree, as well to support the Appropria∣tions
of those Duties, as to prevent the
Ruin of our Trade; and also Considering
that those Duties being laid by Parliament,
could not be taken off but by Parliament;
and that therefore the Plenipotentiaries
could not positively agree to take off
what their Principals had no Dispensing
Power to Direct. Our said Ministers a∣broad,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>I say,</HI> could not therefore reasonably
yield to the taking off those Duties by an
absolute Concession: And as it could not be
expected on the other hand that the <HI>French</HI>
would, without such a Concession, take
off the Duties they had laid on our Goods,
and leave the Duties we had laid upon
theirs to be paid, there appeared but one
Expedient for settling this, which is con∣tain'd
in the 9th Article (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
when the Parliament and Government of
<HI>England</HI> shall agree to take off the high
Duties in <HI>England,</HI> then the <HI>French</HI> shall
take off their Duties upon our Goods in
<HI>France:</HI> The Ballance of Equallity in
which is evedently given to <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
in that the <HI>French</HI> are bound, and the
Choice is given to <HI>England,</HI> whether to
take off their Duties and open the Trade,
or let it remain as it is.</P>
<P>I can see no Objection that lies against
this Article, but what is founded upon
those unreasonable Peoples Notions, who
expect the <HI>French</HI> to give up all Condi∣tions
of Trade to us, and that we at the
same time should absolutely tye up our
Trade from them; and since the Advan∣tage
of the Trade as it now stands lyes
manifestly against the <HI>French,</HI> the leaving
this Article to our own Choice, to Deli∣berate
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
upon and Determine as we shall
find Cause, is a tacit preserving in our
own Hands those Advantages as long as
we shall think fit, which is a kind of
Advance made upon the <HI>French,</HI> that they
have very seldome been found to admit;
and had any such Advantage been given
on our side, some People would have val∣lued
themselves very much upon taking
hold of it, against the Prudence or Fi∣delity
of those who Managed the Trea∣ty.</P>
<P>I shall return to this Head again, after
a brief Examination of some Clauses in
Commerce which are settled by this Trea∣ty,
particularly to the advantage of the
<HI>British</HI> Trade, and which no Treaty be∣fore
this ever either obtain'd, or so much
as offer'd at: Not that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is spoken of
as a Ballance to any thing yielded up by
our Ministers, for it do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not appear that
any thing is so yielded up, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it is
expected those who Compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in in General
Terms should be Answer'd and Silenc'd by
such Particulars; but it may be needful
to remind some People (more Reasonable
than others,) how far the Interests of the
Commerce of <HI>Britain</HI> are really secured
by this Treaty, and what Advantages in
Trade are obtain'd by this Treaty, which
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
never were obtain'd before. <HI>For Exam∣ple:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Imposition of 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton
is here expresly agreed to be quitted in
<HI>France</HI> to all Her Majesty's Ships: It is
true, we quit at the same time the 5 <HI>s.
per</HI> Ton on <HI>French</HI> Ships; but whoever
pleases to Calculate the Number of Ships
Trading from each Kingdom respectively,
will allow there is no Comparison to be
made; and tho' we contented our selves,
as is noted before, with laying that Duty
of 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton upon <HI>French</HI> Shipping, as
a Return for their Tax of 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton,
it was because it was a Duty of the
same kind with the other, rather than
that it was any way Proportion'd in the
Collection; and therefore when the
<HI>French</HI> take of their 50 <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton, for
your 5 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton, they give you 20 <HI>s.</HI> for
every 1 <HI>s.</HI> you give them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Liberty of Importing Cured or
Salted Fish into <HI>France,</HI> is a Point in
Trade Gain'd m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rly by this Treaty, and
which as I noted before, after the Peace
at <HI>Reswick,</HI> was absolutely Prohibited in
<HI>France,</HI> and upon the best Reasons (turn∣ing
the Tables, and making <HI>their</HI> side
<HI>our own</HI>) that could be imagined (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
to Encourage his own Subjects to Fish for
themselves, which is many ways an Ad∣vantage
to the <HI>French</HI> more than to other
Nations, especially in the Breeding and
Encreasing their Seamen, a thing they so
greatly want. This Trade by the 3d
Article of the Appendix to the Treaty is
to be admitted, being only referr'd to the
Discussion of Commissioners, whether it
shall pay according to the Rule of the
Tarif of 1694, or of 1699.</P>
<P N="3">3. Liberty of Religion comes in as an
Addition to this Treaty, and which I do
not observe to be mentioned in any of the
former Treaties, occasion'd, I suppose,
by an Edict of the King of <HI>France,</HI> past and
published in 1699. whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> in no Merchant
Strangers were allow'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>France</HI>
without Conforming to the Popish
Church; whereas now every Protestant
is at liberty to pursue the Dictates of his
own Conscience, as by the 5th Article
thus: <Q REND="inline">"But in the Businness of Religion,
there shall be an entire Liberty allow'd
to the Subjects of each of the Confe∣derates,
as also (if they are married,) to
their Wives and Children, neither
shall they be compell'd to go to the
Churches, or be present at the Religi∣ous
Worship in any other Place: On
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
the contrary they may, without any
kind of mollestation, perform their
Religious Excercises after their own
way, altho' it be forbid by the Laws
of the Kingdom, Privately and within
their own Walls, and without the ad∣mittance
of any other Persons whatso∣ever."
<BIBL><HI>Vide the Treaty</HI> P. 10. <HI>Article</HI> 5.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I might enlarge on the justice of this
Article, and the Consequences, which o∣mitting
it might have brought to this
Nation; but being principally engaged
here, in matters relating to Commerce,
I purposely omit it for the present.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Fourth Article, <HI>viz.</HI> for the
Freedom and Equality of Importing
<HI>Virginia</HI> Tobacco into <HI>France,</HI> seems to
be very considerable, and especially upon
two Accounts, or in two Cases, in which
<HI>England</HI> has been, and might be, under
especial disadvantages in the Tobacco
Trade in <HI>France</HI>; which Trade, as it is
Improving in <HI>France,</HI> is of the last Con∣sequence
to <HI>England</HI> to preserve, and if
possible, to Improve it; that Trade being
at this time in the greatest danger ima∣ginable
of being utterly lost to this Na∣tion,
as to that part of it especially which
is Exported again to other Countries.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
The two Heads of this Article, relate
(1.) to the selling it into <HI>France,</HI> to un∣derstand
which, more especially it is to be
observ'd that there is a certain set of Men
who have engrossed, <HI>as we would call it
here,</HI> the Privilege, or obtain'd a Patent
from the King, <HI>to use our own Words again,</HI>
for the sole Liberty of Importing Tobac∣co.
Again by another Edict, no Stran∣ger
can be allowed to Sell or Import any
Tobacco, but it must be done by such
and such; so that whoever brings any
Tobacco into <HI>France,</HI> is obliged to sell
it to these Men, or have it seized, and
give it to them for nothing which he
pleases. Now this Monopoly is put to
an end, and the Subjects of the Queen of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> may Import and Sell their
own Tobacco to whom they please, and
for the best price they can; and in one of
the Articles not yet adjusted, it is de∣manded
by our Ambassadors, That the
letting out the Duties of Tobacco to
Farmers, shall wholly cease. (2.) The
other Article relating to the Trade of
Tobacco, is, that <HI>Tobacco Imported into</HI>
France <HI>from</HI> England<HI>, shall pay the same
Duties, and no other, as the Tobacco
of any Country in</HI> Europe <HI>or</HI> America<HI>, be∣ing
brought into</HI> France<HI>, does, or shall pay</HI>;
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
this I mention, because of the loud Com∣plaints
that some People make of the
great probability, nay, certainty, that
after the Peace, <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> would
give and take reciprocally such Advan∣tages
in Trade, to, and from each other,
as should be very much to the detriment
of <HI>England,</HI> and to the Advantage of
<HI>France</HI> in matters of Commerce. Now as
it is manifest, that in the Article of To∣bacco,
especially Tobacco prepared, as for
Snuff, <HI>&amp;c. Spain</HI> has great quantities
brought Home yearly from <HI>America,</HI> and
that it would be much for the Advantage
of <HI>Spain</HI> to have the same Imported upon
easy and good terms into <HI>France</HI>; yet, that
by this Treaty, <HI>France</HI> obliges her self to
give neither <HI>Spain</HI> or any other Nation
any advantage over the <HI>English</HI> in the
Trade of Tobacco.</P>
<P>Nor is this an Inconsiderable Article,
<HI>France</HI> being lately come into the Custom
of Smoaking Tobacco, and which <HI>England</HI>
can supply, (placing the Goodness against
the Price,) Cheaper and Better than any
Nation in the World, also the Encroach∣ments
upon the <HI>Virginia</HI> Trade which have
happen'd in these few years, being con∣sidred
together with the discouragements
which the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants have of
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
late met with, this <HI>Article</HI> is of very great
Consequence to them, and may help
to save that sinking Trade from final Ruin,
till some other Methods may be found out
which may restore and revive it some o∣ther
way.</P>
<P>As to the rest of the Articles of this
Treaty as they are the same <HI>Mutalis Mu∣tandis,</HI>
with the other Treaties of the
same kind, either made by <HI>England</HI> or by
other Nations with the <HI>French,</HI> there
needs no other Remark to be made, nor
can any Objection lye against them, the
usual Forms being Calculated for the Secu∣rity
of Commerce and Navigation. I
shall therefore return to the said Ninth
Article, in which all that can reasonably
be objected against in the whole Treaty
seems to be contain'd; and here it may be
enquir'd what the real Objections, that
our People pretend to make are, and to
what they tend; for, till this is known, it
will be very difficult to know what part
of it wants explanation.</P>
<P>The first thing which I meet with, is,
That our high Duties and Impositions as
well as Prohibitions, upon the Growth
and Manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> are demanded
to be taken off, and those Duties reduc'd
to an equality with the Duties on the like
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Goods brought into <HI>Great Britain</HI> from
other Parts.</P>
<P>This, it is alledged, cannot be done,
(1.) Because it is expresly stipulated a∣gainst
in our Treaty with <HI>Portugal.</HI>
(2.) Because it would Ruin our Wine
Trade to other Countries. (3.) Because
it would over-run our whole Trade, and
turn the ballance against us again, as it was
before in favour of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The short Answer to this without any
Circumlocutions, is, <HI>Then, can't you re∣fuse
it and not take those Duties off?</HI> But
then say Objectors, You cannot have the
free Export of your Manufactures into
<HI>France</HI>; to which the Answer is also
direct, you must do without that too. And
what then? <HI>Why then,</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. You will have as free an Export as
you had before the War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. You had better be without that
free Export, if the equivalent which
you are to give for it would Ruin your
Trade. But let us enquire into the thing:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I say, <HI>You will have as free an Export
as what you had before the War</HI>; this has
some things in it which would a little
reflect upon the Prudence and Judgment
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
of some People, and for that Reason I
shall mention them very cautiously;
(1.) You will have the same Liberty of
Trade, which you had after the Treaty
of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> and which then was not com∣plain'd
of at all. (2.) If as some alledge,
the <HI>French</HI> are so fallen upon making the
Woollen Manufactures of <HI>England,</HI> that
they are in a Condition to supply <HI>Spain,</HI>
What need have we to insist so much, and
at so great a Price, upon the Liberty of
sending our Manufactures to them who
can have no occasion for them, being
able to supply themselves and other Na∣tions
also? But to pursue this Argument
would seem Inviduous, this Paper has no
such Design, the present Argument ex∣tends
thus far only; The State of the
Case between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>French</HI>
Trade is such, That no other Conclusion
could possibly be made, in the particular
Article of the respective Duties. Our
Ministers, if they had been willing,
could not have conceded the high Duties
(laid here) to the <HI>French,</HI> because they
could not repeal Acts of Parliament. Some
of the Prohibitions laid on <HI>French</HI> Goods
are so essential to the encouraging the like
Manufactures here, that it could by no
means be thought of; at least, till it was
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
laid before the Parliament, by whom
these Encouragements and Acts of Par∣liament
were Granted and Made. On
the other Hand, How could it be asked
of any Nation to open their Doors to our
Trade, and agree that we should shut our
Doors against theirs? And yet, even in
that Case, the Treaty, as it stands, has, <HI>as is
said above,</HI> actually done so in some Particu∣lars;
for whereas not the least Farthing is
abated by the Treaty on our side, the <HI>French</HI>
in the several Articles mentioned before,
have actually receeded from several things
on their side, as the Fifty <HI>Sols per</HI> Ton
upon Ships; the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nopoly of Tobacco;
the admitting Fish in Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rels, that is, <HI>Her∣ring</HI>
and <HI>Salmon,</HI> which they had prohi∣bited
before? All this is done on their
Side without the least Concession on our
Side; but all that is offered on our Side,
is left to the Parliament to determine,
whether they will come into it or no.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the Equivalent, which you are
to grant in Lieu of the <HI>French</HI> Trade be
too great, if it be ruinous to our Trade,
we had better be without it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Upon this Foundation, no question the
Plenipotentiaries of her Majesty acted;
for first obliging the <HI>French</HI> to stand to it
on their part, they left it entirely to the
Determination of the Parliament, to
whom it would certainly occur, what
the value was they Exchanged, as well
on one Side as the other: If it be true
that the <HI>French</HI> have Wooll sufficient for
their own Manufacturing, and both can
and do Manufacture sufficient, not only
to supply their own Dominions, Collo∣nies
and Plantations, but also to Export
to other Nations, then it must certainly
be of no great Use to us to open a Trade
with them at all, because there is no
Advantage to us in it, they having little
or no occasion for the Manufactures
which we think to supply them with.</P>
<P>On the other hand, If it be true that
the <HI>French</HI> upon taking off their new Du∣ties,
revoking and repealing their Edicts
and Tarifs, will necessarily take off a
great quantity of our Manufactures; then
it cannot be true, as has been so warmly
suggested by same Writers, That the
<HI>French</HI> have go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en the Manufacture into
their own Hands, and will not only sup∣ply
themselves, but other Nations also.
On the other hand, <HI>France</HI> is a Country
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
of a vast Extent, full of People, and if
they take our Manufactures for their own
Use, will take so great a quantity as we
can hardly Buy such an Advantage too
Dear, and the reducing the Duties of
their Goods here; especially as it is
mention'd in the Ninth Article of the
Treaty, may, or may not be a thing of
great Extent to them and to us too, as we
do or do not rightly manage it. For ex∣ample:</P>
<P>What is it they ask of us? I see but two
things that are material in their Demand.
They ask (1.) That we should Repeal all
our Prohibitions. And (2.) Reduce our
Additional Customs, which have been laid
upon their Goods since the Year 1664.
and they offer to do the like. Well says
our Merchants, What then must the
Customs of Wines and Brandies be no
more than in the Year 1664. that will
bring Claret down to the Price of Six
Pound, to Eight Pound a Hogshhead
again, and the common Tavern Price
to One Shilling <HI>per</HI> Quart, and what then
will become of our <HI>Spainish</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI>
Wine Trade? The Article answers for
it self in this Case, the mistake is in the
Reader, not in the Expression; for in
truth, there is nothing at all of such a
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
reduction; but on the contrary, the
<HI>French</HI> are oblig'd to submit to whatever
Duties we think fit to lay upon the Wine
and Brandy, as will appear more parti∣culary
in the next Head: For the <HI>French</HI>
are wisely brought down to consent to this
Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Wine should
pay as much as the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, only
we join to admit, that it shall pay no
more, and yet the Complaint of our
People, against this Clause, is, <HI>so loud,</HI>
that the old Proportion of things can be
ill heard, and some People conlude, that
this equality will ruin the Trade of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
For, <HI>say they,</HI> The Inclination of
our People to <HI>French</HI> Wine is such, that
if it be at the same price with the <HI>Portu∣gal</HI>
Wine, none will Drink the latter; and
therefore it is absolutely necessary, that
the <HI>French</HI> Wine should be laid under the
disadvantage in their payment of Customs,
that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines may still be
made the <HI>Common Draught,</HI> as it is called
through the Nation.</P>
<P>To this there lies two Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ections.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be true that upon opening the
<HI>French</HI> Trade as above, they will necessa∣rily
take our Manufactures in Return for
their Wines, then we have the same Ad∣vantage
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
in both Trades, and ought to En∣courage
one as well as the other, and the
Reason is just that the Duties should be
alike, and the Encouragements or Disad∣vantages
equal; if it be not so, then it
alters the Case: But then some other Ob∣jections
will be ill maintain'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>That the</HI> French <HI>have rejected our Trade to
set up the Manufactures among themselves,
and plac'd high Duties on all our Goods,
without which they would be out-done, and
their own Manufactures Discouraged.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade always paid
a less Duty than the <HI>French,</HI> is a great
mistake, and consequently it is a mistake,
That it they are reduced to an Equality,
the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade will be ruin'd; for it
is apparent that from the Restoration to
the Revolution, being Twenty eight
years, and the Reign of two Kings, the
<HI>French</HI> Wines were always Charg'd at
above 6. 10 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton less Custome
than the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Wines, which always
paid <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine Duties, and yet the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> had a very considerable Trade
with us for Wine, and very far it was
from being lost.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Again, We do not see that this De∣mand
of the <HI>French</HI> will help their Bran∣dy
Trade at all: For all they Demand is
that their Brandy shall pay no more Du∣ties
than the Brandy of other Nations, it
is but passing an Act then that the Brandy
from <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> or any other Nation, shall
pay as much as the <HI>French</HI> pay now, and
the Brandy Trade stands just where it was:
This is so easie to do, and of so little Con∣sequence
to us, that it cannot be Dispu∣ted:
For all the Brandy that we Import
from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> is so little, and so
ordinary, that it matters not to us whe∣ther
we Import any of it or no; and
what-ever then is wanting in the Import
of Brandy by reason of the high Duty,
will be made up in Malt and Melasses
Spirits, and so the Treaty of Commerce,
may be a means to preserve the Distilling
Trade to us, which every one owns is of
the Greatest Consequence, and which
can be supported, humanly speaking, no
other way.</P>
<P>If the <HI>English</HI> Plenipotentiaries fore∣saw
this, they acted very wisely when
they brought the <HI>French</HI> to yield up that
Point, and not absolutely Determine the
reducing the Duties to what they were
before the first War, which would have
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
been very injurious to our Trade; if
they did not forsee it, the good Luck is
greater than the good Meaning; and it is
to be hoped the Commissioners who are
to Treat still of farther Regulations, will
take care to make this Article of the
Brandy effectual.</P>
<P>In this could we be Impartial in our
Judgment of things, we might see that
this Treaty of Commerce is made with
several advantageous Clauses against the
<HI>French</HI> Trade, which none that ever past
before Contain'd, and in this particular it
is remarkably advantageous, That the
<HI>French</HI> are bound to take off all the Duties,
Customs, Tarifs, Edicts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> since 1664.
as by the Article; but we are only obli∣ged
to provide by a Law that their
Goods pay no more than the Goods of
other Nations: So that if we please to
Charge the <HI>Spanish</HI> Brandy, the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Reds, <HI>Malaga</HI> Whites, <HI>Florence, Galitia,</HI>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> at 100 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton, the <HI>French</HI> must
pay the same.</P>
<P>I would not be found putting a wrong
Construction upon the Treaty, and con∣sequently
upon the Treaters; but I leave
every Man to make his judgment from
the Words of the 9th Article, which run
thus:</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/>
<Q REND="inline">'It is farther Enacted, That within
the space of two Months after, a Law
shall be made in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> where∣by
it shall be sufficiently provided, That
no more Customs or Duties be paid for
Goods and Merchandizes brought from
<HI>France</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> than what are
payable for Goods and Merchandizes
<HI>of the like Nature</HI> Imported into <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
from any other Country in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>;
and that all Laws made in <HI>Great∣Britain</HI>
since the year 1664. for Prohi∣biting
the Importation of any Goods
and Merchandizes coming from <HI>France,</HI>
which were not Prohibited before that
time, be Repealed. The General Tarif
made in <HI>France</HI> the 18th day of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI>
in the year 1664. shall take Place
there again, and the Duties payable in
<HI>France</HI> by the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
for Goods Imported and Exported,
shall be paid according to the Tenor of
the Tarif above mentioned, and shall
not exceed the Rule therein settled.'</Q></P>
<P>It seems plain here as Words can ex∣press
it, 1. That we are only to make a
Law or Act of Parliament, to reduce the
Duty of <HI>French</HI> Wines, and the Duty of
all other Country Wines, to the same
Rate, the like of Brandies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2. That
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
upon our doing this, upon our passing
this Law, or within two Months after it,
the <HI>French</HI> are obliged to admit our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Goods upon the Foot of the Tarif of
1664. and to Repeal all the Additions of
Taxes. Customs or Duties Whatsoever
which have been laid since that time, to
the Rate they were at before.</P>
<P>I believe this part of the Article has not
been Considered as it might have been
by most People, and if it had, perhaps so
many would not blindfold have Con∣demn'd
the Article <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ruinous and De∣struct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
 to our Trade, even before they
enquired into the particulars: But as I
hope the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istakes of this kind are not so
many or so great, but that they may be
easily rectified, and the People will be
forward to own themselves in the wrong,
when they see plainly that the Advantage
is on our side. These Considerations
obliges me rather to endeavour to con∣vince
the Persons of their Error, than to
refle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t upon their Weakness.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Treaty, like
other things of so nice a nature, gives
many People uneasiness at first sight,
for want of rightly understanding the
intent and meaning of it, and to others,
for want of Considering rightly what they
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
do understand of it: The Conditions of
it are evidently to the Advantage of the
<HI>English</HI> Commerce in the main; perhaps
some part of Trade, some particular
Persons and Interests in Trade may be
touch'd, may be shortned in their pre∣sent
Advantages and future Prospects;
but as to the Interest of Trade in Ge∣neral,
I think it easie to make out,
that the Commissioners who are to meet
to Regulate Duties. Remove Difficulties,
and State the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="7+ letters" DISP="〈7… letters〉"/>ons and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="5+ letters" DISP="•••••…"/>ences of Things, may so order it, that the
General Interest of Trade in <HI>Britain</HI>
shall be bettered very much by the
Treaty: And tho' it is reported, and is
not doubted but Endeavours are now
using, and will be used to procure Cla∣mouring
Petitions from the several Ma∣nufacturers
and Labouring Poor, as
well in the Trade of Silk as Wooll,
yet I am perswaded Time will shew
them that the first will be little in∣jur'd,
and the last greatly better'd by
this Treaty, espece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly if the Com∣missioners
who shall be Entrusted with
the Management of it understand their
Duty, and act their Part with Courage
and Fidelity.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
And that we may a little open the
Eyes of the Commons about this mat∣ter,
for they seem to be the most affect∣ed
with the Danger from it; a Word or
two may be necessary to say to them:</P>
<P>First, for the Woollen Manufacturers:
It has been for many Years the Com∣plaint,
That the <HI>French</HI> have Prohibited
our Woollen Manufacture; That they
have put a stop to our Trade; That
the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a great Trade to <HI>France,</HI>
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> who make pro∣digious
quantities of our kinds of Ma∣nufactures,
send them into <HI>France,</HI> and
ours are Prohibited, and the like: The
Government having now made an Essay
to Remedy this Evil, and to open a
Trade for our Manufactures, We seem
agriev'd, and as much offended the other
way; because by opening this Trade
with them the Silk Trade and the <HI>Portu∣gal</HI>
Wine Trade will be touch'd. But look
into your Woollen Manufacture Trade, if
opening a Trade with <HI>France</HI> Gives you
a Free Market in so large a Country
where you had none before, Shall not
this Encrease the Consumption of the
Woollen Manufacture? And is not that
of infinitely more vallue than what we
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
speak of against it? Every one agrees
that our Woollen Manufacture is the Life
and Soul of the <HI>English</HI> Trade, and if
this be but forwarded and promoted,
whatever other Trade suffers, it is able
sufficiently to make us amends for that
Loss: The Employment of Families is
this way, and perhaps this way only to
be supplied. If it were possible that
other Manufactures could be Encou∣rag'd,
and this be Preserv'd, we should
all be pleas'd and satisfied: But this
must be Preserv'd, must be Encourag'd,
must be Extended, what-ever risque
we run of the rest. Either <HI>France</HI> will,
<HI>upon the making this Treaty Effectual,</HI> take
off a very great quantity of our Wool∣len
Manufactures, or it will not; <HI>if it
will not,</HI> Why do we desire a Treaty of
Commerce at all? Why do we Com∣plain
that the <HI>French</HI> have Prohibited
Trade with us? <HI>If it will,</HI> if the Mar∣ket
for our Manufactures will be great
in <HI>France,</HI> then what are we Dissatisfied
at? and why is not the Treaty now
made our Advantage? Let those People
who argue against it Compare the Ad∣vantages
of an Encrease of our Wollen
Manufacture, with all the Disadvan∣tages
to other Trades, and see whether
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
the Benefit on one hand is not such,
that the Loss on the other hand ought
to be risqu'd for it.</P>
<P>But here comes in our Complaining
Crouds with Petitions and mournful
Representations, That their Manufa∣ctures
will be ruin'd; the <HI>Colchester</HI>
poor People, as I have been told, are
particularly alarm'd, and yet it was
never heard that the <HI>French</HI> ever went
about to make a Piece of Bays in this
World, no, nor are they able to do it,
they know the impracticableness of it.
What then can be the Dissatisfaction
that can affect that side! I might
name sundry other People who are
Employed in Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI>
especially those which depend upon the
goodness of the Wooll, whether the
Fineness, or the Length of the Staple:
The Petitions therefore of these Peo∣ple,
if they come, ought to express
that their Apprehensions of the <HI>French</HI>
are grounded upon sufficient Evidence
of Fact, such as, That they have already
attempted, or are likely to attempt the
making Bays in <HI>France,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40"/>
It were then to be wish'd, some Peo∣ple
would calculate a little from just pro∣positions,
what quantity of Manufactures
<HI>France</HI> has usually taken from us, when
we Traded with them upon the Foot
of the Tarif of 1664. and what it is
probable they may take again, if mat∣ters
return to that Channel; and
then it would be seen what price we
ought to bid, in Order to restore the
Trade to that Rule of Taxation; and
what such a purchase would be worth
in our other Trade, which, as they say,
we must give in Exchange for it; and
this would be a very good way to make
a right Judgment of the thing, for, as
is said before, either our Goods will
find a Sale in <HI>France,</HI> or they will not;
if they will, it is certainly our Interest
to procure the Trade to be open, and
though it should hurt us a little in some
other branches of our Commerce, the
loss would not be felt, <HI>at least,</HI> not e∣nough
to move us to prevent it, because
of the Profit of the Woollen Manu∣factures
which is our main Support and
Dependency.</P>
<P>This brings me to mention the Com∣plaint
of those who are concern'd in the
Silk Manufactures, which is the alter∣native
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
to the other. These People are
made to believe, that they shall Infalli∣bly
not suffer only, but be ruin'd; and
they talk already of such a stop to the
Weaving, that I know not how many
Journey-men Weavers (more I believe
by a great many than there are in the
whole Broad Weaving Trade) are al∣ready
turn'd off, and out of Employ∣ment.</P>
<P>I do acknowledge it is a hard and
melancholly Circumstance when any
publick Transaction so clashes the parts
of the Body, I mean the Body of the
Nation, that one can hardly live with∣out
the Destruction of the other, and
yet as I said above, the Woollen Trade
is so great, that there is no comparison
between it and the Silk Manufacture;
neither must the preservation of the one
be set in competition, when the preser∣vation
of the other is the immediate
Question: But what if after all the
Melancholly things which have been said
upon this Subject, it should appear, that
the Silk Manufacture in <HI>England</HI> may
be preserv'd and supported in a consi∣stency
with the present Treaty of Com∣merce,
and particularly with that part
of the Ninth Article, which Conditions
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
for the taking off the Prohibitions upon
the <HI>French</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>England.</HI>
This is a Point few have touch'd upon;
but I make no question, it may be farther
handled in time; and those Persons,
whoever they shall be, who shall be
employ'd by the Government to regu∣late
the Duties of the two Naions,
and to remove the difficulties that
may be in the way, cannot be so
Destitute, as to want a proper medi∣um
for the clashing Interests between
the Silk Manufactures of each King∣dom
as well as for that of the Woollen.</P>
<P>If then the Woollen Manufacture be
encreased, and the Silk not diminished,
the Woollen advanced, and the Silk not
discouraged, Men must be very much
at a loss to find out wherein the Da∣mage
or Intricacy of the Ninth Ar∣ticle
of the Treaty of Commerce does
consist.</P>
<P>The missfortune lies in the difficulty
there is to open the Eyes of the Poor
People, who are severally employ'd in
the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, whether of
Silk or Wooll, both which, for ought
I see, are equally allarm'd, and equally
possess'd with apprehensions of their
Trade being ruin'd by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
But all popular Disatisfactions are
allay'd by time, the care of the Go∣vernment
will be to prevent the real
Mischiefs, and the Fears of the People
will wear off in the experiment, when
the Woollen Manufacturers shall see
that a greater quantity of Goods are
Vended than used to be, and the Silk
Manufacturers shall see, that as many
Looms are employ'd as were before,
then the Folly and Blindness of their
present apprehensions will abate, and
they will Peaceably acknowledge that
that were mistaken.</P>
