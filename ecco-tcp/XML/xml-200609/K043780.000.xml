<HEAD>REASONS
Humbly Offer'd
By the Company exercising the
Trade and Mistery of UPHOL∣DERS,
against Part of the
BILL, <HI>For the better Viewing,
Searching and Examining Drugs,
Medicines, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEING call'd upon by several Retailers
and Dispensers of Drugs and Medicines
about Town, to use our Endeavours a∣gainst
the Bill now depending, <HI>for Viewing,</HI> &amp;c.
In Regard of our common Interest and in Gra∣titude
to the said Retailers and Dispensers of
Medicines (which we have always found to be
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
very effectual) we presume to lay the following
Reasons before the Publick, against the said Bill.</P>
<P>That the Company of Upholders <HI>are far
from being averse to the giving of Drugs and
Medicines in general,</HI> provided they may be of
such Qualities as we require, and administer'd
by such Persons in whom our Company justly
repose the greatest Confidence: And provided
they tend to the Encouragement of Trade, and
the Consumption of the Woolen Manufacture
of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We beg Leave to observe, that <HI>there hath
been no Complaint from any of the Nobility, Gen∣try
and Citizens whom we have attended.</HI> Our
Practice, which consists chiefly in outward Ap∣plications,
having been always so effectual, that
none of our Patients have been oblig'd to un∣dergo
a second Operation. Excepting one Gen∣tlewoman;
who, after her first Burial, having,
burthen'd her Husband with a new Brood of
posthumous Children, her second Funeral was
by us perform'd without any further Charges to
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
the said Husband of the deceas'd. And we hum∣bly
hope, that one single Instance of this Kind
(a Misfortune owing meerly to the Avarice of
a Sexton in cutting off a Ring) will not be im∣puted,
to any Want of Skill, or Care in our
Company.</P>
<P>We humbly conceive, that this <HI>Power, by
this Bill lodged in the Censors of the College of
Physicians,</HI> to restrain any of His Majesty's Sub∣jects
from dispensing, and well-disposed Per∣sons
from taking what Medicines they please, <HI>is
a manifest Encroachment on the Liberty and Pro∣perty
of the Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>As the Company exercising the Trade and
Mistery of Upholders, have an undisputed Right
in and upon the Bodies of all and every the
Subjects of the Kingdom; we conceive the pas∣sing
of this Bill, though not absolutely depri∣ving
them of their said Right, might keep them
out of Possession by unreasonable Delays, to the
great Detriment of our Company and their nu∣merous
Families.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
We hope it will be consider'd that there are
Multitudes of necessitous Heirs and penurious
Parents, Persons in pinching Circumstances,
with numerous Families of Children, Wives that
have lived long, many robust aged Women
with great Jointures, elder Brothers with bad
Understandings, single Heirs of great Estates,
whereby the Collateral Line are for ever exclu∣ded,
Reversionary Patents, and Reversionary
Promises of Preferments, Leases upon Single
Lives, and Play-debts upon joint Lives, and
that the Persons so agrieved have no Hope of
being speedily relieved any other Way, than by
the dispensing of Drugs and Medicines in the
Manner they now are; Burying alive being
judg'd repugnant to the know Laws of this
Kingdom.</P>
<P>That there are many of the Deceased, who
by certain mechanical Motions and Powers are
carried about Town, who would have been put
into our Hands long before this Time by any
other well-ordered Government; by want of a
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
due Police in this Particular, our Company
have been great Sufferers.</P>
<P>That frequent Funerals contribute to preserve
the Genealogies of Families, and the Honours
conferred by the Crown, (which are no where
so well illustrated as on this solemn Occasion;)
to maintain necessitous Clergy, to enable the
Clerks to appear in decent Habits to officiate
on <HI>Sundays,</HI> to feed the great Retinue of sober
and melancholy Men who appear at the said
Funerals, and who must starve without con∣stant
and regular Employment. Moreover we
desire it may be remember'd, that by the passing
of this Bill the Nobility and Gentry will have
their old Coaches lie upon their Hands, which
are now employed by our Company.</P>
<P>And we further hope that frequent Funerals
will not be discouraged (as is by this Bill pro∣posed)
it being the only Method left of <HI>carry∣ing</HI>
some People to Church.</P>
<P>We are afraid that by the Hardships of this
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Bill our Company will be reduced to leave
their Business here, and <HI>practise at</HI> York <HI>and</HI>
Bristol, <HI>where the free Use of bad Medicines
will be still allowed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is therefore hoped that no specious Pretence
whatsoever will be thought sufficient to introduce
an Arbitrary and unlimited Power for People to
live</HI> (in Defiance of Art) as long as they can
by the Course of Nature, to the Prejudice of
our Company, and the Decay of Trade.</P>
<P>That as our Company are like to suffer in
some measure by the Power given to Physicians
to dissect the Bodies of Malefactors, we hum∣bly
hope that the Manufacture of Cases for
Skeletons will be reserved solely to the Coffin∣makers.</P>
<P>We likewise humbly presume that the Inte∣rests
of the several Trades and Professions which
depend upon ours, may be regarded; such as
that of the Makers of Hearses, Coaches, Cof∣fins,
Epitaphs, and Bell-ropes; Stone-cutters,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Feather-men and Bell-ringers; and especially
the Manufacturers of Crapes; and the Makers
of Snuff, who use great Quantities of old-Coffins,
and who, considered in the Consumpti∣on
of their Drugs, employ by far the greatest
Number of Hands of any Manufacture of the
Kingdom.</P>
