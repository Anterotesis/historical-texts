<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally thought, that as Pastorals are a kind of poetry, which has been touch'd upon by such a number of poets, that they are easily compos'd, and that their thoughts and sentiments must be trite and vulgar. However this opinion may be true in reason, I hope the following pieces will be exempt from it's censure, as they are form'd on a plan entirely new, and as their design is essentially distinguish'd from any pro∣ductions of their kind, either ancient or modern: unless it be that the first and ninth Bucolic of Virgil are in the same nature. How the ideas of fields and woods, and a poetry whose very essence is a rural life, will agree with the polite taste of the town, and of gentlemen who are more con∣versant in the fashionable ornaments of life, is a question: but I hope as they relate to that war, which is at present the most general topic of con∣versation, this unpoliteness will in some measure be excused.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
The learned reader will observe, that the au∣thor has endeavour'd to imitate the simplicity of the ancients in these pieces, as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to Pastoral, but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in gene∣ral. As to the design of this work, I hope it will not be thought odd, or ill-chosen. The op∣posing interests of a peaceful and rural life, and the tumultuous scenes of war, together with the various struggles and passions arising from thence, seem by no means an improper field for the most elegant writer to exercise his genius in. How far the author of these pieces has succeeded in the performance of this, is humbly submitted to the censure and judgment of the public.</P>

<SPEAKER>ALPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>ARISE, my Lycas: in yon' woody wilds</L>
<L>From a rough rock in deep enclosure hid</L>
<L>Of thickest oaks, a gushing fountain falls,</L>
<L>And pours it's airy stream with torrent pure:</L>
<L>Which late returning from the field at eve</L>
<L>I found, invited by it's dashing sound,</L>
<L>As thro' the gloom it struck my passing ear.</L>
<L>Thither I mean to drive our languid flocks;</L>
<L>Fit place to cool their thirst in mid-day hour.</L>
<L>Due west it rifes from that blasted beech;</L>
<L>The way but short:—come, Lycas, rouze thy dog;</L>
<L>Let us be gone.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas, my friend, of flock,</L>
<L>Of spring, or shepherd's lore, to me is vain</L>
<L>To tell: my fav'rite lamb, the solace dear</L>
<L>Of these grey locks, my sweet and sole delight,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/> Is snatch'd by cruel fate! an armed band</L>
<L>On neighing steeds elate, in wide array</L>
<L>Trampled the youngling, as the vale along</L>
<L>At eve they pass'd, beneath their whelming march.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such throng I heard, as in the neighb'ring wood</L>
<L>I wander'd to reduce a straggling ewe</L>
<L>Escap'd the fold: what time the griesly owl</L>
<L>Her shrieks began, and at the wonted elm</L>
<L>The cows awaiting stood Lucilla's hand.</L>
<L>When strait with sudden fear alarm'd I start,</L>
<L>And list'ning to the distant-echoing steps</L>
<L>Of unseen horsemen with attentive ear,</L>
<L>I stand aloof. But why this deep-felt grief?</L>
<L>Merits such loss these tears and black despair?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alphon, no more to Lycas now remains,</L>
<L>Since he my last and latest care is lost!</L>
<L>Thou know'st my little flock; three tender ewes</L>
<L>Were all my mean ambition wish'd or sought.</L>
<L>Ev'n now nine days, and nine revolving nights</L>
<L>Are past, since these the Moldaw's raging flood</L>
<L>Swept with their wattled cotes, as o'er it's banks</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/> It rose redundant, swoln with beating rains,</L>
<L>And deep immers'd beneath it's whirling wave.</L>
<L>I wak'd at early dawn, and to the field</L>
<L>I issus'd to pursue my wonted toil,</L>
<L>When lo! nor flocks, nor wattled cotes I saw;</L>
<L>But all that met my wond'ring eyes around,</L>
<L>Was desolation sad. Here stateliest oaks</L>
<L>Torn from their roots, with broken branches lay</L>
<L>In hideous ruin: there the fields, that laugh'd</L>
<L>With rip'ning corn, of all their charms despoil'd,</L>
<L>With oozy fragments scatter'd waste and wild</L>
<L>Were seen. I curst the wicked spirit drear,</L>
<L>That in the ruin'd abbey's darkest cell,</L>
<L>(That stands immur'd amid yon' lonesome pines)</L>
<L>I bound with triple chains: his magic pow'r</L>
<L>Oft'times with howling storms, and thunder loud</L>
<L>Deforms the night, and blackens nature's face.</L>
<L>His tempests swell'd the Moldaw's rising streams,</L>
<L>And thus o'erwhelm'd my flock.—But this my heart</L>
<L>Had learn'd to bear, at length to comfort's voice</L>
<L>It had obey'd, and all it's woes forgot;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/> When ah! too soon returning woes invade</L>
<L>My breast, just rising from its former stroke.</L>
<L>When this, the sole survivor, of my flock,</L>
<L>Follows his lost companions; while a wretch</L>
<L>I here remain, deserted and forlorn!</L>
<L>He too had dy'd beneath the whelming surge,</L>
<L>Had not the shelter of my low-rooft cott</L>
<L>That fatal night preserv'd him; where at eve</L>
<L>I hap'ly plac'd him with providing care,</L>
<L>Lest the fell storm, which yet from southern clouds</L>
<L>Threaten'd destruction, and to low'r began,</L>
<L>Might violate his tender-blooming age.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>With piteous eye, and sympathizing heart,</L>
<L>Thy tears I view.—These scenes of war and blood,</L>
<L>The calm repose of every field invade!</L>
<L>Myself had fall'n a victim to their rage,</L>
<L>As in deep dead of night my cave beneath</L>
<L>I lay dissolv'd in sleep, with warning voice</L>
<L>Had not my dog alarm'd with wond'ring ear.</L>
<L>When strait approach'd the cave a savage throng</L>
<L>With barb'rous arms, and habit fierce and wild,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/> With stern demeanour and defying look</L>
<L>Terrify; which the moon's pale-glimm'ring rays</L>
<L>Presented to my sight, as in the boughs,</L>
<L>Close shrouded, of a neighb'ring pine I sat</L>
<L>(Where sudden fear had driv'n me to evade Impending fate, unconscious
and amaz'd)</L>
<L>Secure, but trembling, and in chilly damps</L>
<L>My limbs bedew'd.—The monsters as they past,</L>
<L>With dire confusion all the cavern fill'd;</L>
<L>Hurl'd to the ground my scrip, and beechen cup,</L>
<L>Dispers'd the shaggy skins that form my bed,</L>
<L>And o'er the trampled floor had scatter'd wide</L>
<L>A hoard of choicest chesnuts, which I cull'd</L>
<L>With nice-discerning care, and had design'd</L>
<L>A present to my beauteous ROSALINDE.</L>
<L>Alas! with them her love had been obtain'd,</L>
<L>And me to MYRON she had then preferr'd!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYC.</SPEAKER>
<L>Shepherd, on thee has fortune kindly smil'd;</L>
<L>'Tis mine to feel her grief-inflicting hand!</L>
<L>Alas! each object that I view around</L>
<L>Recalls my perish'd darling to my sight,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/> And mocks me with his loss! see there the
spring</L>
<L>Where oft he wont to flake his eager thirst!</L>
<L>And there the beech, beneath whose breezy shade</L>
<L>He lov'd to lie, close covert from the sun!</L>
<L>See yet the bark smooth-worn and bare remains,</L>
<L>Where oft the youngling rubb'd his tender side!</L>
<L>Ah! what avail'd my care, and foresight vain?</L>
<L>That day he fell oppress'd by whelming steeds.</L>
<L>This hand had built a bow'r of thickest boughs</L>
<L>Compos'd, and wove with intermingling leaves,</L>
<L>Impervious to the sun; and strew'd the floor</L>
<L>With choicest hay, that in the secret shade</L>
<L>He might repose, nor feel the dog-star's beam!</L>
<L>But why this sad, repeated track of woe</L>
<L>I still pursue? Farewel, my ALPHON dear,</L>
<L>To distant fields, and pastures will I go,</L>
<L>Where impious war, and discord, nurse of blood,</L>
<L>Shall ne'er profane the silence of the groves.</L>

<L>Behind the hills when sinks the western sun,</L>

<L>Refreshing every field with coolness mild;</L>
<L>Then let me walk the twilight meadows green,</L>
<L>Or breezy up-lands, near thick-branching elms,</L>
<L>While the still landschape sooths my soul to rest,</L>
<L>And every care subsides to calmest peace:</L>
<L>The mists slow-rising from the rivers dank,</L>
<L>The woods scarce stirring at the whisp'ring wind,</L>
<L>The streaky clouds, that tinge their darken'd tops</L>
<L>With russet hues, and fainter gleams of light,</L>
<L>The solitude that all around becalms</L>
<L>The peaceful air, conspire to wrap my soul</L>
<L>In musings mild, and nought the solemn scene</L>
<L>And the still silence breaks; but distant sounds</L>
<L>Of bleating flocks, that to their destin'd fold</L>
<L>The shepherd drives; mean-time the shrill-tun'd bell</L>
<L>Of some lone ewe that wander's from the rest,</L>
<L>Tinkles far-off, with solitary sound;</L>
<L>The lowing cows that wait the milker's hand,</L>
<L>The cottage-mastiff's bark, the joyous shouts</L>
<L>Of swains that meet to wrestle on the green,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/> Are heard around. But ah! since ruthless war</L>
<L>Has ravag'd in these fields, so tranquil once,</L>

<L>He comes; thy dawn the weary reaper loves,</L>

<L>WHEN sable midnight on the fields and woods</L>
<L>Had spread her mantle dark, then wander'd forth</L>
<L>The pensive ALCON, and the bosom deep</L>
<L>Of a wild wood with solitary steps,</L>
<L>There to lament his wretched fate, he sought.</L>
<L>Him, late as o'er the vale at coming eve</L>
<L>Joyful he walk'd with his LUCILLA dear,</L>
<L>A soldier stern-advancing on his steed,</L>
<L>Robb'd of his love, and tore the beauteous maid</L>
<L>With brutal hand from his contending arms,</L>
<L>Weeping in vain, and shrieking for his aid,</L>
<L>And frowning bore the precious prize away.</L>
<L>The wood, whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought,</L>
<L>Was dark and pathless, and by neighb'ring feet</L>
<L>Long time untrod: for there in ancient days</L>
<L>Two knights of bold emprise, and high renown,</L>
<L>Met in fierce combat, to dispute the prize</L>
<L>Of beauty bright, whose valiant arm shou'd win</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/> A virgin fair, whose far-emblazon'd charms</L>
<L>With equal love had smote their rival breasts.</L>
<L>The knight who fell beneath the victor's sword,</L>
<L>Unhears'd and restless, from that fatal day</L>
<L>Wanders the hated shades, a spectre pale;</L>
<L>And each revolving night, are heard to sound</L>
<L>Far from the inmost bow'r of the deep wood,</L>
<L>Loud shrieks, and hollow groans, and rattling chains.</L>
<L>When the dark secrets of the grove he gain'd,</L>
<L>Beneath an ancient oak his weary limbs</L>
<L>He laid adown, and thus to plain began.</L>

<LG>
<L>This midnight deep to plaintive love accords;</L>
<L>This lonesone silence, and these hideous shades,</L>

<L>Will suit a wretch abandon'd to despair l—</L>
<L>But hah!—what means this sudden fear, that creeps</L>
<L>In chilly sweats o'er all my trembling limbs?—</L>
<L>What hollow-whisp'ring sounds are those I hear,</L>
<L>From yonder glade?—do not I hear his voice?</L>
<L>Does not the knight, that in these shades was slain,</L>
<L>Call me to come, and beckon with his hand?</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/> Do not I see his visionary sword</L>
<L>Wav'd in bright circles thro' the murky air?—</L>

<L>Alas, they will not bring me back my love!—</L>

<L>MYCON, I'll tell thee wonders past belief.</L>
<L>It hap'd one morn, when first the dawning sun</L>
<L>Began to chear the light-enliven'd earth,</L>
<L>Caught with so bright a scene, I sought the fields</L>
<L>Before my wonted hour, and roving wide</L>
<L>Among the vales, the villages and woods,</L>
<L>Where'er my fancy led, or pleasure call'd,</L>
<L>I chanc'd upon a neighb'ring hill to stray,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22"/> To view the glitt'ring prospect from its top</L>
<L>Of the broad Rhine, that roll'd his waves beneath,</L>
<L>Amid the level of extended meads;</L>
<L>When
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It may be suppos'd that in these lines the
shepherd is giving an account of Prince CHARLES's passing the
Rhine.</NOTE> lo! e'er yet I gain'd its lofty brow,</L>
<L>The sound of dashing floods, and dashing arms,</L>
<L>And neighing steeds, confusive struck mine ear.</L>
<L>Studious to know what tumult was at hand,</L>
<L>With step adven'trous I advanc'd, and gain'd</L>
<L>With tim'rous care and cautious ken its top.</L>
<L>Sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight,</L>
<L>From arms, and all th' imblazonrie of war</L>
<L>Reflected far, while steeds, and men, and arms</L>
<L>Seem'd floating wide, and stretch'd in vast array</L>
<L>O'er the broad bosom of the big-swoln flood,</L>
<L>That dashing roll'd its beamy waves between.</L>
<L>The banks promiscuous swarm'd with thronging troops,</L>
<L>These on the flood embarking, those appear'd</L>
<L>Crowding the adverse shore, already past.</L>
<L>All was confusion, all tumultuous din.</L>
<L>I trembled as I look'd, tho' far above,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23"/> And in one blaze their arms were blended bright</L>
<L>With the broad stream, while all the glist'ring scene</L>
<L>The morn illum'd, and in one splendor clad.</L>
<L>Struck at the sight, I left with headlong haste</L>
<L>The steep-brow'd hill, and o'er th' extended vales,</L>
<L>The wood-girt lawns I ran, nor slack'd my pace,</L>
<L>Till at my flock thick-panting I arriv'd,</L>
<L>And drove far off, beneath a deep-arch'd cave.</L>

<L>Dost thou remember at the river's side</L>
<L>That solitary convent, all behind</L>
<L>Hid by the convert of a mantling wood?—</L>
<L>One night, when all was wrapt in darkness deep,</L>
<L>An armed troop on rage and rapine bent,</L>
<L>Pour'd o'er the fields and ravag'd all they met;</L>
<L>Nor did that sacred pile escape their arms,</L>
<L>Whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept,</L>
<L>And fill'd its caverns deep with armed throngs</L>
<L>Greedy of spoil, and snatch'd their treasures old</L>
<L>From their dark seats: the shrieking sisters fled</L>
<L>Dispers'd and naked thro' the fields and woods,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="24"/> While sable night conceal'd their wand'ring
steps.</L>
<L>Part in my moss-grown cottage shelter sought,</L>
<L>Which haply scap'd their rage, in secret glade</L>
<L>Immersed deep.—I rose at early morn,</L>
<L>With fearful heart to view the ruin'd dome,</L>
<L>Where all was desolation, all appear'd</L>
<L>The seat of horror, and devouring war.</L>
<L>The deep recesses, and the gloomy nooks,</L>
<L>The vaulted isles, and shrines of imag'd saints,</L>
<L>The caverns worn by holy knees appear'd,</L>
<L>And to the sun were op'd.—In musing thought</L>
<L>I said, as on the pile I bent my brow—</L>
<L>" This seat to future ages will appear,</L>
<L>" Like that which stands fast by the piny rock;</L>
<L>" These silent walls with ivy shall be hung,</L>
<L>" And distant times shall view the sacred pile,</L>
<L>" Unknowing how it fell, with pious awe!</L>
<L>" The pilgrim here shall visit, and the swain</L>
<L>" Returning from the field at twilight grey,</L>
<L>" Shall shun to pass this way, subdued by fear,</L>
<L>" And slant his course across the adverse vale!"</L>

<L>CORIN, that day I chanc'd at earlier hour</L>
<L>To rise, and drove far-off my flock unpent;</L>
<L>To wash them in a spring that late I mark'd.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="27"/> There the first motions of the deathful day</L>
<L>I heard, as listening to the trickling wave</L>
<L>I stood attentive: when like rising storms,</L>
<L>Hoarse, hollow murmurs from afar I heard,</L>
<L>And undistinguish'd sounds of distant din.</L>
<L>Alarm'd I stood, unknowing whence it came;</L>
<L>And from the fount my flock unwash'd I drove</L>
<L>Suspecting danger: when as nearer yet,</L>
<L>I came advancing, all was tumult loud,</L>
<L>All was tempestuous din on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And all around the roar of war was up,</L>
<L>From rock to rock retost, from wood to wood.</L>
<L>Not half so loud the tumbling cataract</L>
<L>Is heard to roar, that from the pine-clad cliff</L>
<L>Praecipitates its waves; whose distant sounds</L>

<L>CORIN, thou know'st the fir-invested cave,</L>

<L>Our flocks together driv'n: beneath its shade</L>
<L>I had appointed at sweet even-tide</L>
<L>To meet my DELIA homeward as she pass'd,</L>
<L>Bearing her milking-pail: Alas! the thoughts</L>
<L>Of that sweet congress, the preceding night</L>
<L>Soften'd my dreams, and all my senses lull'd,</L>

<L>That day, nor in the fold my flock I pent,</L>

<L><PB N="30" REF="29"/> Repos'd at ease on the green meadow's bed.</L>
<L>When sable night came on, for not ev'n yet</L>
<L>The tumult had subsided into peace,</L>
<L>Ev'n then low sounds, and interrupted bursts</L>
<L>Of war we heard, and cries of dying men,</L>
<L>And a confus'd hum of the ceasing storm.</L>
<L>All night close-shrouded in a forest thick,</L>
<L>Wakeful I sate, my flock around me laid;</L>
<L>And of neglected boughs I kindled up</L>
<L>A scanty flame, whose darkly-gleaming blaze</L>
<L>Among th' enlighten'd trees form'd hideous shapes,</L>

<L>CORIN, thou know'st the fur-clad hermit's cell</L>
<L>Deep-arch'd beneath a rock among the wilds,</L>

<L>And not unknown; for when my flock I fed</L>
<L>Of late beneath the neighb'ring pastures green,</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="30"/> I oft was wont, invited at his call,</L>
<L>At noon beneath his cavern to retire</L>
<L>From the sun's heat, where all the passing hours</L>
<L>The good old-man improv'd with converse high,</L>
<L>And in my breast enkindled virtue's love;</L>
<L>Nor seldom would his hospitable hand</L>
<L>Afford a short repast of berries cool,</L>
<L>Which o'er the wilds (his scanty food) he pluck'd:</L>
<L>Here was my refuge.—All the live-long night</L>
<L>Pensive by one, pale, lonesome lamp we sate,</L>
<L>And listen'd to the bleak winds whistling loud,</L>
<L>And the shrill crash of forests from without.</L>
<L>Soon as the morning dawn'd, the craggy height</L>
<L>Of the steep rock I climb'd, on whose wild top</L>
<L>His rustic temple stood, and moss-grown cross</L>
<L>(The sacred object of his pious pray'rs)</L>
<L>Form'd of a tall fir's thunder-blasted trunk:</L>
<L>Where all beneath th' expansive plains I saw</L>
<L>With white pavilions hid, in deep array.</L>
<L>There too my little fold, which late I left</L>
<L>Standing at eve, amid the warlike scene</L>
