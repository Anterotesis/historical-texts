<HEAD>THE
DANGER
OF
Court Differences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>TATE Polity,</HI> is the
<HI>Devil</HI>'s Divinity, said
good old Bishop <HI>La∣timer</HI>
the Martyr,
when some of the
Moderators in Refor∣mation
were for Tem∣porising
between <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pro∣testant
Religion,</HI> and for not making
a thorough Turn, for fear of the high
Popish Party among the People.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
The Case was this, and the Histo∣ry
of it may be for our Edification.</P>
<P>The King being settled in the
Throne, and having declar'd Himself
a <HI>Protestant,</HI> and that as He was
the first <HI>Protestant</HI> King that ever
wore the Crown, so He resolv'd to
make the first avow'd effectual Step
to a Reformation. The good Bishops,
the godly and zealous Ministers, and
the religious People of all Kinds, who
had been Sufferers in the late Reign,
and under the Tyranny of his Fa∣ther;
these, I say, began to lift up
their Heads, own'd the King warm∣ly,
and encourag'd Him exceedingly
in the blessed Work of Pulling up
Popery and Tyranny by the Roots;
and Planting the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion
and Liberty in the Room of it.</P>
<P>BY THE WAY, you are desired
to NOTE, <HI>that Popery and Tyranny
went then always together,</HI> tho' Ty∣ranny
has got another Companion
since, call'd <HI>High Church</HI>; with the
Reformation came in <HI>English</HI> Liberty,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
that is to say, the Perfection of it;
and as that Reformation went on far∣ther
and farther, Liberty grew in its
Stature and Strength, till it arriv'd to
where it is now. But of this, on a∣nother
Occasion I may say more.</P>
<P>When the Reformation, I say, was
thus attempted, the <HI>Popish</HI> Clergy,
the <HI>High Church of that Day,</HI> raised
a hideous Out-Cry, that <HI>the Church
was in Danger</HI>; and not only so, but
possess'd the ignorant People all over
the Kingdom with such blind Zeal,
and ridiculous Notions, as well of the
King, as of the Reformation, that it
first spread in a general Disaffection,
and afterwards broke out into a most
dangerous Rebellion, in several Parts
of the Kingdom, particularly in the
West; where the City of <HI>Exeter</HI> was
closely besieged by 20000 Rebels;
and at <HI>Norwich,</HI> where <HI>KET,</HI> a Tan∣ner,
at the Head of 30000 Men, took
the City twice, and did a great deal
of Mischief.</P>
<P>When these Rebellions were, by
the Zeal and Loyalty of the Prote∣stant
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
(<HI>Whig</HI>) Party, and by the As∣sistance
of some Foreign Troops, (<HI>Ger∣mans</HI>)
reduced, and the Rebels had
received the Reward of their Trea∣son,
some in the Field, and some af∣terwards
at the Gallows, it was not
doubted but then, the King being
established, and his Enemies subdued,
the Work of Reformation might go
on without interruption, and that its
Enemies would receive all possible
Discouragement at Court; the rather,
because it was known, that the true
Settlement of God's Church, and of
the true Religion, was the King's
fix'd Design; That as He had Zeal
sufficient to suffer any thing rather
than to give over his just Underta∣king,
so He had Courage, even beyond
himself, both to stand by his Friends,
and to do Justice to his Enemies, and
to fear no Man.</P>
<P>But in the middle of this happy
Scituation of Things, a cursed Spirit
of Trimming, call'd at that Time <HI>State
Policy,</HI> thrust it self in among the
great Men at Court; and had not
the Courage, Steddiness, and Resolu∣tion
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
of the King, tho' not at that
Time fully acquainted with the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Government, interposed, the Re∣formation
had been ruin'd, and crush'd
in its Birth; all the Blood and Trea∣sure
spent, all the long struggle of
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Party in the preceed∣ing
Reign, and all the Expectations
the World had entertained of a hap∣py
Establishment in this Nation, had
been lost and destroyed; indeed, not∣withstanding
all the King could do,
and even in spight of his Resolution
to the contrary, it did make great
Impressions upon his Affairs, and great
Havock among his Friends; brought
his Friends to fall out and quarrel
with one another, and obliged the
mildest and most merciful King on
Earth to sign the Execution of his
nearest Friends; and now, as one
<HI>Party,</HI> then another, got uppermost
in the Administration, the poor af∣flicted
<HI>Prince</HI> was oblig'd to act now
this Way, then that Way, contrary
even to his own Inclination, and
sometimes almost contrary to his
Principle.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
We, who are the Posterity of those
<HI>Reformers,</HI> and who now enjoy our
Liberty and Religion, as the Conse∣quence
of that excellent Prince's Zeal
and Sincerity in <HI>Religion,</HI> have reason
to be thankful that He stood his
Ground in religious Matters; and had
He with the same steddiness and Cou∣rage
governed his turbulent, merce∣nary,
and ever-clashing, disagreeing
Courtiers, we had, perhaps, enjoy'd
many Ages ago an Inheritance of Li∣berties
which the World are not yet
acquainted with; for 'tis evident, that
the Pride, the Ambition, the Avarice
and Envy which reign'd among the
Ministers of that Reign, so effectual∣ly
disconcerted their Measures, and
divided their Interests, that they could
not support the Settlement of the
Succession beyond the Life of that
King, but fell first off from one ano∣ther,
and then fell all in with <HI>Mary,</HI>
the Daughter of King <HI>Henry,</HI> who
was declared Illegitimate, was set a∣side
by the Establishment, and was
no better at that Time than a Po∣pish
Pretender; and had not a more
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Masculine Spirit govern'd them in
the next Reign after, tho' in the Per∣son
of a Woman, we had, as the Ef∣fect
of those Court Divisions, been all
at this time Papists and Slaves, Ido∣laters
in our religious Conduct, and
mean dejected Scoundrels in our civil
Conduct, and such would our Poste∣rity
have been also.</P>
<P>The Secret History of this Devi∣lish
Court Snare, I mean as to the
religious Part, and as well what Dan∣ger
it put the Reformation in, as
also how it was quash'd with one
noble steddy Word of that resolute and
pious Prince, must needs be very di∣verting
and profitable to all that read
it, especially at a time, when the E∣nemies
of the same Reformation are
trying the same Hellish Practices up∣on
the very same Nation.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Story is this: The
King being young in the Govern∣ment,
at his first Accession to the
Crown, was however very happily
surrounded with grave and wise Coun∣sellers,
in whose Wisdom and Fideli∣ty,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Vigilance and Courage, the Na∣tion
had a full satisfaction: They
fought his Battles abroad with Gal∣lantry,
and with Success; they go∣verned
his Affairs at Home with ex∣traordinary
Sagacity, Judgment, Pru∣dence,
and Justice: The very Name
of the King began to be terrible to
Popery; The Mobbs and Tumults
abated, as well as the Rebellious were
quash'd, and which was still better
than all, the general Disaffection of
the People began to wear off, and
the publick Affairs seemed to run with
a full Channel into Peace and Set∣tlement,
when two unhappy things,
which on a sudden broke out among
the Courtiers and Ministers of State,
had like to have overthrown Peace,
Settlement, Religion, nay, King and
all.</P>
<P>These were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Trimming, and Temporizing in
the Reformation. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Division and Faction among the
Courtiers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
I'll be very brief in the Account
I shall give of these Two unhappy
things, and yet I desire so to ex∣plain
the Circumstances, and so faith∣fully
to relate the Conduct of the
Persons, that the Warning it may be
to future Ages may be flagrant, and
the Moral or Improvement may revive
with the Story.</P>
<P>The Rebellious just now mention'd,
had been in behalf of, or rather on
the Pretence of Zeal for the Church,
and it had been indeed a most dan∣gerous
Crisis to have such bold and
desperate attempts made in the In∣fancy
of the King's Affairs.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>States Men,</HI> who were
in the Main real Friends to the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI>
and very faithful to the
King and his Interest, yet intimida∣ted
a little by the Dangers they had
been in, and by the Daily Insolence
and Threats of the <HI>Popish</HI> Party,
who were still very numerous in the
Country, started very unhappily, and
in an ill Hour, this wretched Opini∣on
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
or Notion, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was
too bold an attempt for the King,
to undertake to make a thorough
<HI>Reformation</HI> at once upon the Peo∣ple;
that it would exasperate the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Party, and as they had power∣ful
Alliances abroad, and formidable
Numbers at Home, they would not
only be always Plotting against the
publick Peace, but that it was too
probable they might some time or
other get the Start of them, and
ruine them all; and that therefore it
were but good <HI>State Policy</HI> to tem∣porize
a little, to go on by Degrees,
and to act with <HI>Popery,</HI> as some of
the good Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> did with
Idolatry, of whom it was said, <HI>They
did that which was right in the Sight of the
Lord. Nevertheless the high Places were
not taken away, but the People burnt In∣cense
yet in the high Places,</HI> 2 Chron.
XX. 33.</P>
<P>In like manner, they were for let∣ting
the <HI>Reformation</HI> go on gradual∣ly,
leaving such of the <HI>Reliques</HI> of
<HI>Popery</HI> as were of less Consequence
for a while unreformed, admitting a
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Mixture of Papists and Protestants
into their Councils and Administra∣tion,
that the former might be there∣by
be engaged by the Court Ser∣vices,
and Preferments, to embark no
more with, or encourage the People
in their Disaffection; Nor did it end
in this Proposal of a <HI>motley Ministry,</HI>
but even a <HI>motley Reformation</HI> was
to be the Consequence, and the High
Church were to be so blended with
the low, that is to say, Papist with
Protestant, and so much of the <HI>Re∣liques</HI>
of Popery were to have been
left in the new Establishment of Re∣ligion,
that as a famous States Man
of that Day, who had more Since∣rity
than all of them, said, meaning
the Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> They would set
up a Religion that was neither Pa∣pist
nor Protestant, that God would
not own, nor themselves under∣stand.</P>
<P>When
this Project was laid before
the King, He caused the Arch-Bishop
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to read it over to Him.
But it disgusted Him extremely; and
when the other Bishops began to
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
speak in Favour of it, the King, who
had more Courage and Honesty than
all of them, answered in that memo∣rable
Expression of Scripture, <HI>Cursed
be he that doth the Work of the Lord
deceitfully</HI>: And when another Bi∣shop
asked a little tartly, <HI>What then
must be done? Shall we be always
fighting about difficult Questions?</HI> The
King still standing steady to his Prin∣ciples,
and shewing an abhorrence of
the Cowardice and Treachery of his
Courtiers, rising up in some Heat,
replied in the Words of our Saviour,
<HI>Every Plant which my Heavenly Fa∣ther
has not Planted shall be rooted
up</HI>; and no Man durst move any
thing of that Kind to Him ever after.</P>
<P>This Zeal and Courage of the King
established the Reformation.</P>
<P>This Trimming and Treachery,
would have sent them all back to
Popery.</P>
<P>Leaving this History to be close∣ly
applied, as Occasion shall offer, I
proceed to the second Thing which
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
ruined the Peace of that blessed King's
Reign, and which, as I have said,
let in a <HI>Popish</HI> Pretender upon
them in the next, and this was,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Divisions at Court.</HI> Emulation,
Ambition, Avarice, and Envy, pos∣sest
the Minds of his Courtiers, and
the Consequences were these.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They ruined and destroyed
one another.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They brought in the half re∣formed
Courtiers that them∣selves
had spued out, letting
in their Enemies to support
their Factions one against a∣nother.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Those very Enemies, who
came in by these Divisions,
brought in a <HI>Popish</HI> Pretender
upon them in the next <HI>Reign,</HI>
and brought them all to Fire
and Faggot.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If this were a Parable or Allego∣ry
only, by which to represent to our
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
present People, the Dangers which
might possibly happen upon taking
in their Enemies, to fortifie and form
Interests against their Friends, and to
support their several Parties one a∣gainst
another, it might have been
thrown by and disregarded as the
Chimera of a scribbling Head, which
had in it no more than such People
generally produce.</P>
<P>But as it is a real History, the
Matters of Fact upon Record, and
the Truth of them not to be dis∣puted;
as the Tragical Part which
follow'd was acted upon the Stage
of our own Country, and the Fire
and Faggot of their Popish Persecu∣tions
smoaked in our own Streets,
as it was not long ago, and the
Ruine of those who suffered under it
is felt in our Families even to this
Day, it comes with the greater E∣nergy
upon us, the Force of it is
not to be resisted, nor can the Cau∣tion
given from it be called unjust or
improper.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
Like Causes produce like Conse∣quences
in all Ages, or at least, may
do so; it may not therefore be im∣proper
to look briefly over the Court
Divisions of that <HI>Reign,</HI> and see how
they began, how they were carried
on, and how it came to pass that
the best and only Establishment of
those Times for a Protestant Succes∣sion,
was overthrown and destroyed,
meerly and only by the Contention
and Divisions of the great Men at
Court; and in doing this, we may
take some notice of their Persons.</P>
<P>The Great Men at Court in that
Day, consisted of the Duke of <HI>Somer∣set,</HI>
prime Minister, Uncle to and
Protector of the King, Captain Gene∣ral,
and <HI>Commander</HI> in <HI>Chief</HI> of all
his Forces; the Duke of <HI>Northum∣berland,</HI>
formerly Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
of the antient Family of <HI>Dudley</HI>;
Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> a great Friend and As∣sistant
to the Duke of <HI>Somerset</HI>; Mr.
<HI>Cecil,</HI> Secretary of State; the Mar∣quiss
of <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Among these, it is necessary to
give a brief Description of a few;
The Two contending Factions, and
which made most stir with their
Strife, were the two Dukes of <HI>Somer∣set</HI>
and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> commonly
known in those dangerous Times,
when People durst not speak plain,
by the Distinction of Duke <HI>Blue,</HI>
and Duke <HI>Green,</HI> of which I can give
no other Account than by Traditi∣on,
that the one being a <HI>Southern</HI>
Title, had reference to the Garter of
St. <HI>George.</HI> And the other being a
<HI>Northern</HI> Title, might have the like
to that of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> whose Ensigns
are the Blue and Green Ribband
But I do not find that the Person
was ever received as a Knight of that
Order.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Blue</HI> had great Personal Me∣rit,
and was exceedingly beloved
both by the King and the People; he
was an able <HI>States Man,</HI> and a very
great <HI>Soldier</HI>; he had by his Wisdom
and Prudence greatly assisted in set∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>g
the Prince upon the Throne,
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
and was his last resort for <HI>Council</HI>;
for as he had a great Interest a∣mong
the People by his Fame, and a∣mong
the Nobility by his great Al∣liances
with the best Families; so he
had a Mind always present to him∣self
in the greatest Exigence, and
was esteemed to be the best Man of
<HI>Council</HI> of that Age, especially upon
any dangerous Juncture. In the
Field, he was superior to himself, if I
may so say; I mean, that there he
excelled not only all Mankind, but
even outdid all his own other Excel∣lencies;
and this he shew'd at that
memorable Battle of <HI>Pinkie,</HI> by which,
as well as on many other Occasions,
he had in the preceeding Reigns made
the <HI>English</HI> Arms, as well as his own
<HI>Conduct,</HI> terrible to the World.</P>
<P>Having said thus much of his Per∣son,
it cannot be omitted, because
something of it will come necessari∣ly
to be mention'd hereafter, that he
was not more happy in his own
<HI>Character,</HI> than he was unfortunate in
that of his Wife; a Woman of a
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
terrible Spirit, insupportably Haugh∣ty,
Turbulent, Covetous, Treache∣rous,
Revengeful, and being withal
busie and medling in publick Mat∣ters,
push'd her Husband upon the
worst Scenes of his Life, and which
indeed ended in his Ruine. I have
only to add, that as their <HI>Charact∣ers</HI>
were the Reverse of one ano∣ther,
so was the influence they had
in the World; one being exceeding∣ly
beloved, and the other universally
hated by the People.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Green</HI> was of a <HI>Cha∣racter</HI>
quite different from the other,
having very few good Qualities to re∣commend
him; the best that could be
said of him was, that he was of a very
great and antient Family, famous for
Heroes, and Men of Gallantry and Cou∣rage,
and was himself a Man of a da∣ring
and enterprising Courage. But
tho' he had on many Occasions shewn
his Gallantry in Action, yet he was by
most thought fitter to Command un∣der
another, than to lead Armies as
General in Chief; yet in this it was
thought he had the Misfortune to dif∣fer
from common Fame in the Opinion
of himself.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
He serv'd under Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> at the
great Battle of <HI>Pinkie</HI>; but was very
willing to have it said, that the great Vi∣ctory
obtained that Day, was owing
more to his Conduct, than that of the
General, and had sometimes the Vanity
to say, that if he had had the Com∣mand,
the War would have been car∣ried
on more to the King's Advantage;
however, as Duke <HI>Blue</HI> consented after∣wards
to leave the Conduct of the War
to him for one Campaign, it did not ap∣pear.</P>
<P>In
a Word, tho' they both appear'd
Friends to the King, and to his Interest,
and on all Occasions acted with their
utmost for his Service, yet it was well
known they were not cordial Friends to
one another; but did one another in
their Turn all the ill Offices they could,
till it brought Duke <HI>Blue</HI> first to the
Block, and Duke <HI>Green</HI> followed in a
very little while after, the same Way.</P>
<P>In the Fate of Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> followed
several of his fast Friends, for Men of
such Figure seldom fall alone, Mr. <HI>Stan∣hope,</HI>
Sir <HI>Ralph Vane,</HI>
<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> and several others, were put to
Death, tho' all innocent, being meer
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Sacrifices to the political Rage of Duke
<HI>Green</HI>; and the King himself, who lived
but a little while after, yet lived to be
satisfied of their Innocence, and to la∣ment,
in the most moving Terms, the
fatal Divisions of his Ministers, which
had brought him to cut off his most
faithful Servants, and had imposed up∣on
him, in a most vile Manner, to shut
his Ears against the Remonstrances of
his best Friends in their Favour; the bit∣ter
Remembrance of which, follow'd the
good Prince to his Grave.</P>
<P>After the King's Death, Duke <HI>Green,</HI>
who was the chief Favourite of the
Successor, assumed the Prime Mi∣nistry
and Management of Affairs. But
the <HI>Pretender</HI> got ground every Day,
tho' really, more by the Hatred the
People bore to Duke <HI>Green,</HI> than from
any real Disaffection to the Successor;
at length the Protestant Successor was
entirely abandoned by the Nation, tho'
a Person of the most amiable Perfecti∣ons,
most agreeable and engaging Tem∣per,
and most perfect Virtue in the
World.</P>
<P>Thus a Popish Pretender was brought
in, the Protestant Cause was lost, and
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
the Protestant Successor Deposed and
Murther'd, purely from the Hatred the
People bore to the wicked Actions of
him, who was then Head of the Party;
whose Conduct was always rash and
foolish, and who having broken the U∣nity
and Harmony which was before
happily carried on thro' all the publick
Affairs, had divided the Court, some
one Way, some another, particu∣larly
had taken into the Administration
People of quite differing Principles from
the King, and of views differing from
his Interest; which, it seems, he did at
all Hazards, only to make his Party
strong against his Enemy; nor was
Duke <HI>Blue,</HI> but especially his Wife, back∣ward
in the same unhappy Measures,
making use of their Power with the
King, to bring in, and keep in several
People, both in the Army, in the Navy,
and in the Civil Affairs, such People as
were not Friends to His Majesty's Interest,
so be it they were Friends to their Par∣ty,
and willing to engage against their
Opposers.</P>
<P>This being the Practice on both sides,
they declar'd openly against one ano∣ther,
and were openly called by the
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Neuters at Court, as well as by the Peo∣ple,
the <HI>Blue Faction,</HI> and the <HI>Green
Faction.</HI></P>
<P>There was indeed another Sort, which
was called the <HI>third Party</HI>; these were
headed by Mr. <HI>Cecil,</HI> one of the Secre∣taries
of State, and by the Person who
principally managed the King's Trea∣sure,
whose Name I do not remember;
but they were too weak to carry on any
Design, and the King also was prevailed
with to discountenance them, or at least,
not to shew them that Favour which
they at first expected, so that they
were able to do little; and the <HI>Blue</HI> and
<HI>Green</HI> Factions drawing all to them∣selves,
these soon lost their principal Ad∣herents,
who were drawn in to side
with one Faction or the other, as their
Profits or Designs led them on.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> he was a weak,
or rather, indolent Person, whose Cha∣racter
was not extraordinary, and his
Body infirm; and Duke <HI>Green</HI> having
no kindness for him, and yet not ca∣ring
to push directly at him, because he
thought the King had some kind∣ness
for him, persuaded him to resign
the Seals; he having desired to lose his
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Place with as little Disgrace as possible.
The Seals were soon after given to a
Person quite in another Interest.</P>
<P>From these Dissentions and Divisions
at Court, says a Reverend Historian of
those Times, it followed, that nothing
was seen during that blessed King's Reign
but Troubles, Commotions, and Dis∣quiets,
both in Church and State, till
Way was made, by the Distractions of
the State, to overthrow the whole Con∣stitution,
destroy the Reformation, and
let in Popery and Persecution in the
Reign that followed.</P>
<P>It is time to turn to our own Times,
to which we may make a sudden Tran∣sition,
without letting drop the Memo∣ry
of what has been said. It had que∣stionless
been a piece of very happy
Advice, whoever had given it, if some
clear sighted Person had in those Days
earnestly press'd and advised the States-Men
of King <HI>Edward</HI> to unite in their
Duty to the King, and their Care of
the Common-wealth, and not to suf∣fer
their Avarice or Ambition, their
Pride, or their Passions, to have any
share in the Measures they were taking;
but to carry on the Publick Affairs with
Zeal, for the good of their Country, and
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
the Interest of their Sovereign; fortify∣ing
the King's Interest, by the good A∣greement
of his Servants, and the Fide∣lity
of his Councellors, which had they
done, they were able enough to have
transmitted the Crown to the Prote∣stant
Successor, after the King's Death,
in spight of all that <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Popish</HI>
Interests could do to the contrary. For
it was even then true, that the Interest
of the Popish Successor had very little,
if any Foundation in this Kingdom, but
what was founded among <HI>Protestants</HI>
themselves; making good that old Axi∣ome
of Policy, that <HI>England</HI> can never be
ruined, or her Liberties destroy'd, by
any Power other than her own. So that
it was the Ignorance, Weakness, and Di∣vision
of <HI>Protestants,</HI> that set the Crown
at that Time on the Head of <HI>Popery,</HI>
not the real Power of the <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>Whether there may be any Parallel
drawn from those Times to the present,
is not so much the Design of this Work,
as it is to caution the greatest Men of
the present Age against the Mischiefs of
Dividing and Separating themselves in∣to
Parties and Factions of any kind, as
the only fatal thing that can befal them
and the whole Kingdom at this Time,
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
and leave the next Reign exposed to the
Disaster of a <HI>Popish Successor.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Body of the People of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
seems now to be united under the
Reign of King <HI>George,</HI> and that Union is
settled and confirmed by the steddy Ad∣ministration
of his Majesty's Affairs; by
a well chosen Ministry, Faction is found
at present only among the Defeated Par∣ty,
and their Disappointments are made
irretrievable only by the Vigilance and
Unanimity of his Majesty's Councils
and Measures.</P>
<P>By the same Rule, if that Vigilance
and Unanimity abates; if some draw one
Way, some another; if the Ministers of
State let go the Reins of the Admini∣stration,
and fall out one with another;
if these Conquerors fall out about divi∣ding
the Spoil, where is the Strength
of the Administration? What will all the
Victory they now triumph in amount
to? Faction will quit the routed Party
immediately, and harbour her hated
Head in the Verge of the very Houshold:
And what will follow, Divisions, Envy,
making and strengthening of Parties at
<HI>Court,</HI> fortifying Interests, and support∣ing
themselves with Numbers, strug∣gling
for Places, and bringing in Friends;
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
and thus, in a Word, the <HI>Civil War</HI> will
be transposed from the remote Parts to
the very Walls of the King's Palace,
and which is worst of all, to the very
inside of those Walls.</P>
<P>And not to represent Things in a
more dangerous Posture than they real∣ly
will represent themselves, I shall lay
down a little the usual Rise and Progress
of Court Divisions.</P>
<P>Court Divisions generally spring
from two Fountains, <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI>;
I know there are two softer Words to be
given it, which are more Courtly in∣deed,
but not more significant, nor so
justly adapted to describe the thing,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Ambition.</HI> and <HI>Emulation</HI>; but I
keep to the Terms. I think all the
Ambition we now see practised may be
well styled Avarice, and all their Emula∣tion
centers in Envy.</P>
<P>These creep insensibly into Courts,
the first Discovery of it we find in the
Great Men engrossing Places of vast Pro∣fit,
many of them into one Hand; we
saw lately a great Man possest of about
seven, if not more, Places of immense
Profit, and justly dismiss'd for not be∣ing
content with that.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
This prompts them to heave and
thrust at one another, Picquing and Ca∣balling
to support themselves, and sup∣plant
others; whether this be the Case
among us now or not, it is not my Busi∣ness
to enquire; it's evident this has fre∣quently
been the Case in the <HI>English</HI>
Court in former Times, and it is as evi∣dent,
and for this Reason I mention it,
that this Party-making and dividing at
Court, never yet failed to overthrow
and turn out the Party that's so divided;
and if this should be the Case now, what
have we to expect?</P>
<P>Wherefore the People of <HI>England</HI> are
more than ordinarily concerned to use
the utmost Interest they have in the
present great Ministers, or those to
whom the Administration is intrusted,
to persuade, intreat, and in short, warn
them against dividing their Interest.</P>
<P>To begin this Persuasion, I shall take
the Liberty to tell a short Story, which
I am able to Name the Persons too who
were concerned.</P>
<P>Soon after the Restoration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the IId. when the Civil War
was laid asleep by the general Act of
Oblivion, many of the old Round-Head
Party began to appear openly,
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
who had skulkt about for fear of the
Revenge of the Cavalier Party when
they should come in, and who expect∣ed
to be proscrib'd and excepted, as is u∣sual,
in the general Pardon.</P>
<P>One Major <HI>Gladman,</HI> an old Soldier,
and who had been very much concern∣ed
in the Governing Party, was sitting
in a Coffee-House in the City smoak∣ing
a Pipe, when an antient Gentleman
in a long Shoulder Belt, which was at
that Time the Badge of a Cavalier,
came and sat by him; he began very
high with him, Are not you such a
Man, Sir? Yes, Sir, replies the Major:
Then you are one of those Fools, Sir, says
he, that have managed this poor Nation
after your wretched manner, and must
give an Account to Heaven for what
you have done.</P>
<P>We must so, Sir, replies the Major;
but, Sir, since the King has been pleased
to give an Act of Oblivion, and all these
Things are laid asleep Sir, it is not the
kindest thing Gentlemen can do to us,
to insult us with it, when we have no
freedom to reply.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, the Act of Oblivion has
buried it, says the old Gentleman, and
I am not going to revive that; but
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Heaven will call you all to Account for
being the most unaccountablest Fools in
the World, that when He had given
you Victory, and committed the Na∣tion
to your Government, and we poor
Cavaliers durst not show our Faces in
the World, you, in a shameful and
most contemptible manner, pul∣led
one another to pieces for the Spoil;
and giving up all your Advantages,
brought us in again with your own
Hands. Are you not a Parcel of Fools?</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, says the Major, you have
toucht us in a sore Place; if our Divisi∣ons
had not opened a Door for you, it
was impossible you could ever have re∣turned.</P>
<P>Let
all those who God and King
<HI>George</HI> have entrusted with any share of
the Honour and Trusts of the present
Government, stand warned by such a
Story as this. Nothing can wound the
present <HI>Interest</HI> of King <HI>George,</HI> nothing can
give Life to his Enemies, nothing can
revive the Jacobite Cause, in a Word,
nothing can effectually ruine us now,
but dividing.</P>
<P>Not all the Power of <HI>France</HI> can hurt
us, we see that cringing, and reduced,
and complying with any Conditions
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
to get an Alliance with us for their
own Preservation.</P>
<P>Not all the other Popish Powers of
<HI>Europe</HI> can hurt us; we see them solli∣citing
and entreating to be admitted in∣to
the same Alliance for their Security.</P>
<P>Not all the Jacobite High-flying Party
at Home; we see them reduced, and the
Pallace of the King crouded with Peti∣tioners,
begging Reprieves for their
principal Leaders, to save them from
the Scaffold and the Gallows.</P>
<P>What then can hurt us, what can
be capable to weaken our Hands, so
strengthen'd by Conquest? to weaken
our Measures directed by such Heads,
to slacken the Reins of our Admini∣stration,
committed to such; nothing
but private Feuds and Factions, no∣thing
but Divisions among our selves;
and then no Government is so fixt, no
King so establish'd, no Constitution
so well founded, but it will undo, and
overthrow it.</P>
<P>Let us go among the High Party,
and hear what they say, and indeed
we need go no farther to confirm
the Argument, what is it has given
Life to their dejected Souls, bright∣en'd
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
their Countenances, and put their
Expectations again upon the Wing.</P>
<P>It was but the other Day that
all their broken Reeds having fail'd
them, they were brought to give up
their Cause, and to confess they had
nothing left to do but to despair.</P>
<P>Now they are another People; they
promise themselves new Scenes, flat∣ter
themselves with new Hopes, and
encourage one another to new Mis∣chiefs;
we see their Leaders meet∣ing
in Cabals, great Conferences held
upon the present Scituation of their
Affairs, and Measures taken with as∣surance
of Success, for the Forming
their Interest, and Propagating their
Cause, even to <HI>Avignon</HI> it self the
Encouragement is spread; and we have
Letters from thence, which say, their
Friends in <HI>England</HI> give them En∣couragement
to look for great Things
in their Favour, for that, say they,
we are assured there are great Divi∣sions
at Court; that the <HI>Whigs</HI> are
fallen out among themselves; that
<HI>Argyle</HI> being out on one Hand, and
<HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d</HI> on the other, great In∣terests
are made to bring them in
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
again, which there is some hopes of;
that, on the contrary, great Parties
are made against them; and that by
means of these Dissentions, the Friends
to another Interest are caress'd more
than usual; for that States Men ne∣ver
value who they take into Busi∣ness,
if it be found necessary to sup∣port
them against their Oppposers.</P>
<P>To conclude, the best Construction
which I can make of the whole Mat∣ter
is, in Favour of this Intelligence
from <HI>Avignon,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it is a
meer piece of Jacobite News; that
indeed it is an idle Rumour, or a
malicious one; that it is impossible
it should be true; and that the Case
at Court stands directly thus, and
no otherwise, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That there is an entire Harmony
and Unity in every Part of the <HI>Ad∣ministration</HI>
among the <HI>Ministers of
State</HI>; that there is not so much as
the least Jealousie, Uneasiness, or Mis∣understanding
among them; that a
perfect Friendship and good Corre∣spondence
spreads it self through the
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
Minds and <HI>Management</HI> of all the
great Men at Court, and an exact
<HI>Ʋniformity</HI> in their Measures; that if
there is any Ambition among them,
it is only in the great Struggle, to
render their August Master the best
Services; be most vigilant for his
Safety, and most vigorous in Oppo∣sition
to his Enemies the Jacobites.</P>
<P>Consequently, that all the Rumours
spread aborad of <HI>Factions</HI> in the Court,
and of Divisions into Parties looking
this Way, and that Way, are Chi∣merical,
Groundless, and of no Value,
and are not to be regarded other∣wise,
than to let us see, to what the
Jacobite <HI>Interest</HI> tends, what they
drive at, and what we are to expect
from them, if ever that fatal Time
should come, when the <HI>Ministers of
State</HI> should break and divide from
one another, and open the Gaps and
Breaches which the Protestant Suc∣cession
had so happily closed.</P>
<P>The Reasons in Particular which I
give, why I cannot believe any such
Rumour, and why I must believe that
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
all these Accounts of <HI>Divisions</HI> among
the <HI>Ministry,</HI> come from a Wicked,
Desperate, Jacobite Party, who desire
to sow Strife among us all, and ex∣pect
a Harvest to their Party from it;
I say, the Reasons of this <HI>Opinion</HI> of
mine, are such as these:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Because I take the <HI>Ministry</HI> to
be honest Men, and their Honesty is
engaged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Because I take them to be no
Fools, and their Senses are engaged.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>It is no time to flatter great Men,
and speak fine Words to them, because
they are in Figure and Authority; the
Nation is interested in their Conduct,
and will be injur'd or advantag'd as
they behave.</P>
<P>We have boasted of them hitherto,
and hope we have had Reason; we have
sung their Fame, and insulted the To∣ries
when they have attempted to de∣fame
and lessen them on any Account
whatever; we have rested upon them
in a full expectation of their answering
the best Things we could say.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
We have upbraided the <HI>Tories</HI> with
their corrupt Administration, their gra∣tifying
their Avarice, their Ambition,
their Revenge; with betraying their
Queen, and Country, and Posterity, to
push their separate Interests; After we
had run a Length of Reproaches up∣on
their want of Honesty, their Vices,
their falshood to their Oaths, their ex∣posing
their Country to <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Popish</HI> Tyranny, and their being of
mercenary Turn-coat Principles; do∣ing
all this to serve the <HI>French,</HI> who
had bought them; and the Clergy,
who had debauch'd the, I say, af∣ter
we had loaded them with all that
they deserved on this Account; how
did we at last laugh at them for Fools
in their Politicks, weakening and de∣stroying
their new Schemes, and blow∣ing
up all their own <HI>Mines,</HI> by breaking
among themselves, and dividing into
Factions and Parties.</P>
<P>Did we not tell them, they were
whetting the Knives that would cut
their own Throats, and building the
Scaffolds for their own Execution?
Did we not set still and laugh at them,
<PB N="38" REF="39"/>
for opening the Gaps, at which we
told them, we, the <HI>Whigs,</HI> would enter
and blow them all up? Did we not fre∣quently
say, that tho' they were such
Knaves as to design the <HI>Pretender,</HI> yet
they were withal such Fools, as to bring
in the House of <HI>Hanover</HI> for us, by
the meer Madness of their Measures?</P>
<P>What could the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI>
before the King's Accession, desire more;
or what News could they have desir'd
more agreeable, more satisfactory, than
that their Enemies in the late Ministry
were divided, that they were falling
out for Places, and setting up Factions
in the Court one against another, for
engrossing the <HI>Administration?</HI> Was not
this to tell them in plain Words, that
they were not fit for the Post they
were in, and that nothing was to be ap∣prehended
from them, but that when∣ever
the Crown should descend, they
would either break quite in Pieces, and
vanish into nothing, leaving the Way
open for their Enemies to come in
without Resistance; or that they would
be tripping up one another's Heels, to
see who should be foremost in Sacrifi∣cing
the rest to the <HI>Successor.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40"/>
Nor were we in the Wrong in our
Judgment, for just thus it was; and
the Event has proved them as great
Fools in their Dividing, as they could
be Knaves in their first Uniting.</P>
<P>Will it be less true in the present
Case, if we could believe any thing of
the Rumours that are spread; Can the
Honesty or the Senses of the present
Ministry be spoken of with the least
Satisfaction, if they should act thus?
Would they not be the most Unac∣countable
of all Men that ever pretend∣ed
to the Use of Reason, and the worst
of all Lunaticks? It cannot therefore
be, it must all be a Slander, an abomi∣nable
cursed high Church Slander. To
tell us of a <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Faction, and an
<HI>Arg<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> Faction, and a <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>le</HI> Par∣ty,
it must be regarded like the Gasco∣nades
of the <HI>Tories,</HI> when they told us
of the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Marr</HI>'s mighty Forces,
the terrible Fortifications he had raised
about <HI>Perth,</HI> the vast Levies making
for him abroad, and the great Succours
he had received from <HI>France</HI>; which
appeared at last to be only a great Mist,
that wasted before the <HI>Sun</HI>; a great
Croud, which separated and disappear∣ed
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
at the Approach of but Ten Thou∣sand
Men.</P>
<P>The Circumstances of the present
Ministry confirm us in this Opinion al∣so;
they have the most happy <HI>Settle∣ment</HI>
in their Hands, that ever this Na∣tion
enjoy'd, secur'd by victorious
Troops, a steddy and unanimous Par∣liament,
and an easie satisfied People;
they are supported by a wise and mag∣nanimous
Prince, strong in his Interest
abroad, growing in the Affections of
the People at home; Rebellion, like
the Dragon under the Feet of St. <HI>George,</HI>
is conquer'd, and lies grovelling in the
Dust; <HI>Jacobitism</HI> is reduc'd to a <HI>State</HI>
of <HI>Despair</HI>; <HI>Popery</HI> has laid by its Pre∣tensions;
and suppliant <HI>France</HI> seeks
Aid at our Court against her own <HI>State</HI>
Factions.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Ministry</HI> have nothing
to wish which they do not enjoy, they
have nothing to do but to Congratu∣late
one another, and enjoy in Com∣mon
the full Favour of their Prince, do
their Duty, and receive the Reward of
their Fidelity.</P>
<P>Can it be possible then that these
Men should fall out with one another?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42"/>
Can there be Room among them
for Ambition, or Envy, or Faction, so
much as to put a Foot in? no, 'tis
impossible. Do they not swim in a full
Sea of the King's Bounty? Are not all
their Foes made their Footstool? Have
they not all that, one would think, Ava∣rice
or Ambition could prompt them
to ask? What can they without blush∣es,
desire of their Country more than
they enjoy?</P>
<P>For these Men to fall out, to di∣vide
into Factions and Parties, what
would it be, but to tell the World,
that they are not the Men they have
been taken for; that however they
have made Pretences to be disinter∣ested,
and to have serv'd King <HI>George</HI>
purely for the Justice of his Cause,
and the good of their Country, that
yet they are true <HI>States Men,</HI> that they
are of the same Mold with others that
went before them; that their aim has
been all along their own Interest, the
satisfying their own voratious Appe∣tites,
and the most unbounded Ava∣rice;
that Pride, and the worst sort
of Ambition, has been the Helm that
steers all their Actions, and that no∣thing
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
but to be above one another,
can make Peace among them; in a
Word, that every Man wants to be
prime <HI>Minister,</HI> and cannot bear to
see any <HI>Man</HI> have a Share of Power
or of Favour equal with himself; in
which they must make good Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI>'s saying reverse, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Courtiers of every Party are the same.</P>
<P>For these Men to divide, and bandy
against one another, as it has been
scandalously said of them, would be
to tell the World, they have no va∣lue
for King <HI>George,</HI> no regard to
his Interest, no concern for his Safe∣ty,
or his Family; that they serve
Him only for what they can get
by Him, and in Hopes of getting
the supreme Management under Him;
and care not what Hazard they run
of his Interest, to secure their own.
For this Reason, one cannot without
the greatest Contempt of their Per∣sons
and Designs, and thinking them
the most Perfidious Generation of
Men in the World, I say, one <HI>cannot</HI>
so much as entertain a Notion of
their being any ways Guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44"/>
Should Division and Faction creep
in among the present <HI>Mannagers</HI> of
Affairs, what must we expect? in∣deed,
what may we not expect, but
that the whole Party should divide
as they divide, and where will this
end? <HI>If a Kingdom divided against its
self cannot stand,</HI> how shall a Party
divided against it self be supported?
And if this present <HI>Interest,</HI> divide
again, what is before them, but
that the <HI>Interest</HI> of the <HI>Tories,</HI> and
the <HI>Pretender,</HI> which has been bro∣ken
and trampled under Foot, purely
by the Harmony and Unanimity of
<HI>Councils,</HI> with which His Majesty's
Affairs have been bless'd, shall re∣vive
and overwhelm us all: United
as we were, <HI>none can say</HI> we were
not in Danger, and next to God's
directing Providence, nothing but the
Vigilance and steddy Conduct of the
King and his Ministry, united toge∣ther
Heart and Hand, to surprize and
circumvent the Enemy, render'd their
too well laid Designs abortive.</P>
<P>If that Unity is broken, if the
Eyes that should watch for the pub∣lick
<PB N="44" REF="45"/>
Safety, are employed in an en∣vious
Glancing at one another, watch∣ing
their private Advantages, to sup∣plant
and displace, establish and bring
in, as their own ambitious Views
direct; what will become of the pub∣lick
Interest? Who will look out for
that? And how will the Ship of State
run on Ground and split upon the
Rocks, while the Pilots forget to
<HI>Steer,</HI> and are falling out among
themselves?</P>
<P>The first Step which Party Men
generally take to support themselves,
when they lay Designs one against
another, is, to strengthen themselves
with <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Dependents,</HI> who
shall be ready at all Times to serve
and support them, especially where
<HI>any thing</HI> that may injure them is
to be passed by Votes. To do this,
they make use of their <HI>Interest</HI> with
the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> to recommend and
bring such <HI>Persons</HI> into pub∣lick
<HI>Employment,</HI> as well to keep
others out, as to fortifie their <HI>own
Interest</HI>; for Numbers has always
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
been esteemed a great Thing at
Court.</P>
<P>To do this, we always find they
make no scruple to court mu∣tually
in their turn, I say, to court
the Party that are out, who they
bring into play, upon Pretence of
their being turn'd, or of having pro∣mised
to be directed.</P>
<P>This was what the Courtiers did
in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, when the
Lord <HI>Havershame</HI> described it by
that unhappy, but significant Word,
a <HI>Motley Ministry</HI>; and how far
that Motley Ministry went towards
ruining that Prince's Affairs, is too
recent in Memory to be forgot.
How far the like Folly would go
to ruine our present Affairs, we ought
to tremble to think of.</P>
<P>When the Parties thus bring in
their Enemies, Two Things fre∣quently
follow, and indeed, seldom
fail.<LIST>
<PB N="46" REF="47"/>
<ITEM>1. That they cannot, when they
find their mistake, get them out
again.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That they often master and
throw out those that brought
them in.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We need not look far back for
Examples of this Kind, the People
now at Court know too much of
this. Truth, to have any occasion to
be put in Mind of it. The Court
Revolution of 1709, is an eminent
Instance of it, and to that they are
referred.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter is, that
it cannot, without most uncommon,
and most injurious Reflections upon
the present Administration be sug∣gested,
that there are any Misunder∣standings,
Dividings, or Factions a∣mong
them; their Honesty will not
permit it, their Senses must be their
Protection against it, they cannot
do it without being Fools to them∣selves,
Traytors to King <HI>George,</HI> and
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
Knaves to their Country, and for
this Reason I conclude that it is all
false, a meer Rumour, raised by their
Enemies to amuse the World, scan∣dalize
the Government, and bouy up
their own sinking Party.</P>
<P>If it should appear to be otherwise,
you shall hear farther.</P>
