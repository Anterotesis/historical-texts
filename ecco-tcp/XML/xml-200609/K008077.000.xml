<HI>ROYAL BENEVOLENCE.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD>Most humbly Inscribed to Her MAJESTY
Queen <HI>CAROLINE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>OST bounteous QUEEN, my grateful
Thanks I pay,</L>
<L>Which scarcely for the Dress of Words will
stay:</L>
<L>Your ROYAL MAJESTY a Muck-worm took</L>
<L>From Labour, pleas'd with his mean trifling Book:</L>
<L>And now the Reptile at your Foot-stool lays</L>
<L>In humble Strains, to sing your worthy Praise.</L>
<L>The Wits prophane may court <HI>Urania</HI>'s Aid,</L>
<L>And make Addresses to a fictious Shade.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
But I need no such Phantoms to inspire;</L>
<L>Your Royal Bounty sets my Soul on fire;</L>
<L>And what I lov'd before, I now admire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As on our Parents Labour was intail'd,</L>
<L>I work'd, and fallen State of Man bewail'd:</L>
<L>I pray'd for Ease, from Sorrow, Want and Pain,</L>
<L>And labour'd, my poor Offspring to maintain.</L>
<L>Without ambitious Thoughts, or Wishes vain,</L>
<L>I found my Ease in only Rest from Pain;</L>
<L>And bless'd the Giver, when I thrash'd the Grain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET Want sometimes would stare me in the Face,</L>
<L>And scarce my Labour wou'd supply my Race.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Heav'n, in pity to my poor Estate,</L>
<L>Brought me in Favour with the Wise and Great:</L>
<L>And heaping Bounty upon Bounty more,</L>
<L>Rais'd me to Plenty from a Threshing-floor.</L>
<L>Your Royal Goodness o're my Cottage shone,</L>
<L>With brighter Beams, than did the rising Sun:</L>
<L>And from a Barn Companion to the Mice,</L>
<L>Plac'd me at Ease, and in a Paradice.</L>
<L>Under great Heaven, my QUEEN I must adore,</L>
<L>Whose bounteous Soul no Captive needs implore.</L>
<L>Like <HI>Phoebus,</HI> in his Glory, all She sees,</L>
<L>And blesses all in various Degrees.</L>
<L>May Heav'n preserve all who surround her Throne,</L>
<L>And may her Line ne'er want a ROYAL SON.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Now, as I've leisure Fancy to display,</L>
<L>My Pen shall ever grateful Homage pay:</L>
<L>For sure no Wretch can e're so stupid prove,</L>
<L>As to be blind to such abundant Love.</L>
<L>What am I—What I was—From whence I came,</L>
<L>Are Thoughts can't leave me long without a Theme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN e're I view the Grain in Barn or Field,</L>
<L>Or see a Farm that does GOD's Blessing veild;</L>
<L>The Prospect will such Contemplation raise,</L>
<L>As must begin in Joy, and end in Praise.</L>
<L>No Meadow green, or Stack or Cock of Hay,</L>
<L>But where I view will furnish an Essay:</L>
<L>And then the Objects of my Praise will be,</L>
<L>The mighty Lord, and her great Majesty.</L>
<L>Our GOD, the Author of Benevolence,</L>
<L>Who does, by second Causes, Gifts dispense;</L>
<L>In Goodness as in Greatness infinite,</L>
<L>His Children to good Actions does excite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE saw her Majesty made up of Love,</L>
<L>And often heard her Orrisons above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To know his Will, and knowing it to do</L>
<L>His Work, is all She aims at here below.</L>
<L>Th'Almighty seeing so much Christian Grace,</L>
<L>And how, on Earth, she ran the heavenly Race;</L>
<L>Has constituted ROYAL <HI>CAROLINE</HI></L>
<L>His Agent here, to make his Glory shine.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
The Noble, Great and Powerful, humbly kneel;</L>
<L>Submissive, full of Loyalty and Zeal:</L>
<L>And ask but to obey to all Commands,</L>
<L>Sign'd by such just and mutal Royal Hands.</L>
<L>The poor anticipated have no more,</L>
<L>Than but to have it barely known they're Poor.</L>
<L>Nay, some have strove their Poverty to hide,</L>
<L>Through Shame, or what should shame, remaining Pride.</L>
<L>But such our Royal QUEEN in secret found,</L>
<L>And brought them out of Mire to blessed Ground.</L>
<L>And this contriving and performing Good,</L>
<L>Runs in each Vein of HANOVERIAN Blood.</L>

<LG>
<L>COULD Mortals taste of heavenly Bliss and
Joy,</L>
<L>The Rapture would the human Frame destroy:</L>
<L>Our little Minds, tost with perpetual Cares,</L>
<L>Are lost, when Grief or Joy comes unawares.</L>
<L>Excess shakes Nature, but Vicissitude</L>
<L>In Moderation is an Interlude,</L>
<L>When right apply'd to all our humane Good.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I, who have labour'd in a Threshing-floor,</L>
<L>Was once contented in my State, tho' poor:</L>
<L>Yet, like all Mortals, still I pray'd for Ease,</L>
<L>But labour'd still, like the industrious Bees;</L>
<L>Knowing the Winter comes, when Food is dear,</L>
<L>And Nature wants Supplies of wholesome Cheer.</L>
<L>Justly to think is Happiness on Earth,</L>
<L>And cheerful Thoughts at Labour is sound Mirth.</L>
<L>I, who have labour'd for a trifling Sum,</L>
<L>Was pleas'd, to think the time of Pay was come.</L>
<L>One Shilling goes for this, and one for that,</L>
<L>And still the Flail went patt and patt a-patt.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
The Wife would say, How can you be content?</L>
<L>I know not how to pay your Quarter's Rent.</L>
<L>I bid her look on Birds in Bushes there,</L>
<L>And see the little silly Insect here;</L>
<L>Behold the Order of the Universe,</L>
<L>And ask the Hen and Chickens for a Purse.</L>
<L>She talk'd, like Woman, guided by a Will,</L>
<L>Who nothing knew of real Good or Ill:</L>
<L>But when she had the Course of Things survey'd,</L>
<L>She own'd, what all must own, Heaven sends its Aid.</L>
<L>To all its Creatures, Reason and Instinct join,</L>
<L>And both, with Care, compleat our GOD's Design.</L>
<L>A virtuous Man may various Troubles find,</L>
<L>But still the greatest Trouble's in the Mind.</L>
<L>The Death of Friends affects us—Poor, we pine;</L>
<L>But could we see our Maker's great Design,</L>
<L>There's some good End, and something that's Divine.</L>
