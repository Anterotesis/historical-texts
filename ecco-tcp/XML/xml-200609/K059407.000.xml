<HEAD>THE
CASE
Fairly Stated between the
<HI>TURKY</HI> Company
AND THE
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Turky</HI> Company wou'd
be but ill Charg'd with so
much Art in the Conduct of
their Trade, if they were
capable of using no Art in the
Defence of it.</P>
<P>No Man can charge them with want
of Cunning in what they now push at,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
and had they us'd as much Honesty
in their Argument as they shew Art in
their Design, some plain Questions and
Answers wou'd bring us all to the
End of the Dispute; and the House of
Lords had not had the Trouble of this
Act.</P>
<P>The Papers they have hitherto pub∣lish'd,
have generally aim'd at two
Things, and both of them seem to be
unfair, and something sophistical:
I am loth to call it Shuffling, with
respect to the Persons of the Gentle∣men
concern'd; but Necessity obliges
me to say, That what they offer, evi∣dently
looks one Way but means ano∣ther;
the specious Pretences they make
for the publick Good of Trade, En∣couragement
of Manufactures, and the
like, are only Covers to conceal the
grand End of separate Interest; which,
'tis manifest, is the Thing they aim
at.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They pretend in their Papers, to
advocate for the Good of their
Country, against the Encourage∣ment
given by the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chant
to the <HI>French,</HI> to sell their
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Cloth in <HI>Turky,</HI> by taking off the
Raw Silk, which is the Return;
whereas really, they are in their
Capacity as a Company, the Rea∣son
of all the Encouragement the
<HI>French</HI> meet with in the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade; and if it were not for the
ill Conduct of the <HI>Turky</HI> Compa∣ny,
the <HI>French</HI> wou'd have no
Silk to sell, nor vend any Cloth
in <HI>Turky</HI> worth naming.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They pretend, that the support∣ing
the <HI>Turky</HI> Company is the In∣terest
of the Trade; whereas their
being a Company, in the Sense of
their present Management, is the
great Obstruction of the Trade;
and will, if not restrain'd, be the
Ruin of it.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In their Papers, therefore, it is evi∣dent,
they aim (1.) at suppressing the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's Trade to <HI>Turky;</HI>
and (2.) at engrossing the Trade of
selling Cloth in <HI>Turky,</HI> and of Silk in
<HI>England,</HI> in order to imposing their
own Price upon the Buyers of Cloth
Abroad, and the Manufacturers of
Silk at Home. Both which would, if
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
obtain'd, effectually declare them a Mono∣poly,
in the grossest Sense of that Word.</P>
<P>Their Oppressions Abroad, their un∣fair
Dealings with the Merchants, who
from <HI>Leghorn</HI> interfere, as they call it,
with their Trade; their By-Laws, their
arbitrary Proceedings upon them, and all
the rest of their ill Conduct, they give
up, and seem to plead Guilty to them all,
so they can but get this Bill.</P>
<P>With so much Eagerness they push for
this Bill, that they not only manag'd
their Introduction into it with the utmost
Art, and push'd it on with unweary'd
Application, to hinder their Books being
look'd into, but they said they were wil∣ling
to consent to any future Laws, to
limit, nay, even to punish their Exorbi∣tance,
so they may but be indulg'd with
the Advantages they drive at in this Bill.</P>
<P>In a Word, they were in such a Passion
for this darling Bill, that they are wil∣ling
to give up their Reputation as a Com∣pany,
submit to all the Parliament may
think fit to do with them, or all the Pu∣nishment
that may be inflicted upon them,
provided they may but save THIS BILL.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
It is their own Expression in one of
their Cases: <HI>Possibly the</HI> Turky <HI>Company
may have committed Faults, and made un∣fitting
By-Laws: If they have done both,
yet</HI> THIS BILL <HI>may be necessary.</HI> And
in another Place, <HI>All that can be objected
against the</HI> Turky Company, <HI>may be re∣medy'd
by a</HI> BILL <HI>in another Parliament,
and they may take</HI> ANOTHER TIME <HI>for
the remedying of it. If a Company op∣presses,
the Parliament may curb and re∣strain
it by</HI> FUTURE LAWS. And the
like.</P>
<P>I wou'd not treat the Company with
Indecency, but this seems to me to be
little more than that of a Man detected of
a grievous Trespass, craving Leave for an
immediate Power to oppress and injure
his Neighbour, and putting off the Ex∣amination
and Punishment of his own
Crime to another Season; as if the re∣medying
the Grievance on one side, had
not the same Justice in it, and did not
call for the same Concern of the Publick
to rectify, as the other. I might have
illustrated this by a more severe Simily,
if I were willing to carry Things to the
heighth.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
But let us take these Gentlemen in their
own Way, and use their own Words, as
above: <HI>Possibly the Company have commit∣ted
Faults, and made unfitting By-Laws:</HI>
It is most certain they have, (and I inter
what I believe every one will grant, <HI>viz.</HI>)
Therefore it is not reasonable, those that
have already abus'd their Power, shou'd
be now enabled to abuse it farther. And
I humbly hope that the Nature of the
Companies By-Laws and Orders may be
inspected.</P>
<P>What they now ask, is neither more
or less, than to have a Power granted
them to oppress and injure the Traders
to <HI>Turky</HI> by way of <HI>Italy;</HI> who, they grant
already, they have injur'd and oppress'd.
As to the Bill they demand, the Nature
of it shall presently appear, when the
Fraud of the Design is more effectually
laid open. Something extraordinary must
sure be the Case, that these Men are so
very earnest to have the Examination of
the Conduct of the <HI>Turky</HI> Company put
off; it is a shrewd Suspicion of Guilt,
when Men are so extraordinary shy of
coming to an Examination; see how it
runs thro' all their Arguings: <HI>If the Bill
passes,</HI> say they again, <HI>the Conduct of the</HI>
Turky Company, <HI>all their</HI> By-Laws, <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>even their</HI> Charter, <HI>if lyable to any just
Exceptions, may be examin'd afterwards
by Parliament.</HI> Very good, and why not
now? Why must not the Parliament be
allow'd to examine Now into their Con∣duct,
their By-Laws, their Oppressions,
their arbitrary Proceedings, and their
Charter, if lyable to Exceptions, as there
is some Reason to believe they all are?</P>
<P>Nor is the examining into these Things
so incongruous to the Bill depending as
they would insinuate: I alledge, and un∣dertake
to make it appear, that the Bill
they seek cannot be rational, if the other
Conduct of the Company is fully examin'd
into; and therefore it is not at all unrea∣sonable
to demand, that both be enter'd
into together; 'tis a great Mistake to say,
that the Conduct of the Company has no
Relation to this Bill. On the contrary,
if the Company have misbehav'd, if they
have oppress'd and injur'd the Fair-Tra∣ders,
if their by-Laws are unjust, and
they are a real Monopoly, and ablove all,
if they seek to be able to act as a Mono∣poly
by Virtue of this Bill, then 'tis ab∣solutely
necessary to examine their Con∣duct
before this Bill should pass. <HI>As for
Example.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
If this Bill in its Nature tends to
making the Company a Monopoly; if it
is evident, that in soliciting <HI>this Bill,</HI>
they aim at a Power to monopolize; if
it appears, that <HI>this Bill,</HI> if pass'd, will
put that Power into their Hands: Then,
with humble Submission to the House, it
is absolutely necessary to examine into
the Abuse of the Power they have, and
the Reason of the Power they seek, and
of their seeking it, and all before this
Bill be suffer'd to pass.</P>
<P>And what can it be, but this plain
Dependance of these Things, one upon
another, that makes these Men so back∣ward
to have their Conduct examin'd?
But that they are sensible, that if the
House should ransack their Behaviour and
the Use they have made of the Powers
and Privileges which they have been en∣trusted
with, they would see very good
Reason to consider well of it before they
entrusted them any farther.</P>
<P>Nor is this an unjust or an unfair Re∣flection,
because we that are oppress'd by
the Company, and have Reason, feelingly,
to mention the Abuse of the Powers they
have been entrusted with, have much
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
more Reason than other Men to conclude
what Use they would make of it, if far∣ther
Powers were committed to them as
a Company.</P>
<P>And here, because I am necessarily to
enter with Plainness and Freedom upon
the Detecting a general Scheme of Fraud
and Injustice, which evidently seems to
run thro' the whole Course of this Mat∣ter,
and that, as above, much less Honesty
than Art shews itself in the earnest So∣licitations
which are and have been made
for this Bill, I must be allow'd to di∣stinguish
between the Gentlemen con∣cern'd
in their personal and private Ca∣pacities,
and in their Capacities as a Com∣pany.</P>
<P>In
their former Capacities, I have no∣thing
in the least to say; here is no per∣sonal
Satyr intended, nor do I direct any
Reflection, in this Affair, to this or that
particular Man. There are, without
Doubt, many worthy and honourable
Persons in the <HI>Turky</HI> Company.</P>
<P>But their Conduct, as a Company, is
another Thing; and no Man's private
Reputation is concern'd in it; and yet
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
I must acknowledge my self to be of the
same Mind which King <HI>Charles</HI> IId gave
as his Opinion to a certain Lord Mayor
of <HI>London,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it was not pos∣sible
for a Man to act in a Society with
the same Honesty and Jussice as in their
separate and private Capacities; but that
all Societies and Companies were Tyrants
and Oppressors by the Nature of the
Thing.</P>
<P>Having made these Postulata with the
Gentlemen-Members of the Company, as
private Persons, I shall, with the more
Freedom, speak to their Behaviour as a
Company.</P>
<P>I have mention'd how strange it is that
these Gentlemen should be so very Earnest
for this Bill, and for its passing, without
enquring into their Conduct. I shall now
unravel this Mystery, and lay it open to
the World; and when I have done so,
the Wonder will cease.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The first Reason is, because en∣quiring
into their past Conduct,
will necessarily discover the True,
but conceal'd Design of <HI>the Bill.</HI></ITEM>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<ITEM>2. It will discover the Reason for
endeavouring to obtain it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It will discover the Consequences
of it, if obtain'd.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>That the Discovery of any, or of all
these Things, would most effectually o∣verthrow
the Bill, seems reasonable for
me to conclude, from the Knowledge I
have of the certain Application of the
House of Peers, to detecting all clandestine
Measures, Projects, and Attempts, couch'd
under the specious Pretence of Right,
Property, Publick Good, and the like;
by which the Subjects are frequently im∣pos'd
upon, the Publick abus'd, and pri∣vate
Persons injur'd.</P>
<P>It will be impossible the House can see
the exact Connection that there is between
the former Conduct of that Company and
the Attempt couch'd under the Cover of
<HI>this Bill,</HI> and not see how artfully they
seek to protect their past ill Conduct, by
obtaining an Authority for worse; and
to support the Oppressions of their former
Measures, by enlarging them in those
they should now get Power to act by.
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
To bring this Home to the Point in Dis∣cute,
that is to say, <HI>the Bill.</HI></P>
<P>The Pretences of the Bill are specious,
(<HI>viz.</HI>)
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Raw Silk which the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants import from
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> is <HI>French,</HI> and the Re∣turn
for their <HI>French</HI> Cloths sold
in <HI>Turky.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Quantity of the said
Silk imported into <HI>England</HI> is
very great.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it is injurious to the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If these Things were really so, every
Man should grant the Consequence at the
first Word, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>the Bill was ne∣cessary,</HI>
which is what they alledge.</P>
<P>But, as was said in one of the <HI>Italian</HI>
Merchant's Cases, These Things would
go a <HI>great Way in the Charge;</HI> but for one
Misfortune <HI>attending them, which is,</HI> that
<HI>they happen not to be TRUE.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
The chiefest Evidence they bring of it,
is, That in the Years 1714 and 1715, a
very great Quantity of Raw Silk was
bought in <HI>France,</HI> brought to <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
and shipp'd to <HI>England.</HI> Now, tho' I
should grant this, that in those two Years
a great deal of <HI>French</HI> Raw Silk was brought
from <HI>Marseilles,</HI> yet that will neither prove
that it has been so in other Years, or that
it can ever happen so again: Nor if it were
to happen again, can they argue from it
any Advantage to the <HI>French</HI> Trade, or
Disadvantage to the <HI>English,</HI> but just the
contrary, as will appear in the following
Heads:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. From the Reason and Occasion of the
<HI>French</HI> Merchants having that great
Quantity of Raw Silk upon their
Hands at that Time (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they
had a Prospect of an open Trade with
<HI>England</HI> for their Wrought Silks,
<HI>the Treaty of Commerce being then on
foot here;</HI> Which failing, and the
Alteration of their Coin happening
at the same Time, they were oblig'd
to sell off the Silk Raw at a very
great Loss; so that half the Ban∣quiers
of <HI>Paris,</HI> half the Banquiers
of <HI>Lions,</HI> and almost all the Mer∣chants
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
at <HI>Marseilles</HI> were ruin'd by
it, and became Bankrupt, having lost
above one third of the Value of their
Capital Stock. If this be the Way
that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants shall al∣ways
encourage the <HI>French</HI> Trade,
the <HI>French</HI> will have little to boast
of, and the <HI>Levant</HI> Company little
to complain of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is well known that the <HI>French</HI>
did not receive that great Quantity
of Silk, which was then upon their
Hands, in Return for Cloth, or any
Manufactures; all the Cloth that
cou'd have been in <HI>France</HI> cou'd not
have purchas'd it; but they sent a∣way
Ready Money, and bought up
such a Quantity, <HI>upon the Prospect</HI>
of Advantage by the Treaty of Com∣merce
in <HI>England, as above;</HI> the
Disappointment of which was the
Ruin of so many Merchants there.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When the Raw Silk in <HI>France</HI> was
thus cheap, and bought by us so
much to their Loss, it was greatly
wanted in <HI>England;</HI> and the Price
in <HI>January</HI> 17 14/15, refus'd by <HI>Turky</HI>
Merchants here was 30<HI>s.</HI> and 32<HI>s.</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>per lb.</HI> and there was not Silk enough
to be had in <HI>England</HI> to employ our
Weavers, or to carry on our own Silk
Manufacture; <HI>so that</HI> at this Time,
which these Men dwell so much up∣on,
the Importation of <HI>French Turky</HI>
Silk, was infinitely the Advantage
of our Trade, and in Proportion
ruinous to <HI>France.</HI> And the Silk so
Imported was about <HI>June</HI> 1715 sold
to our Manufacturers in <HI>London,</HI> at
23 <HI>s.</HI> And the Price will be always
kept low, so long as there can be
two Importations.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This sufficiently answers the great Im∣portation
in the Years 1714, 1715, on
which these Men insist so much; and
proves that it was a Circumstance of Trade
which can never happen again; and if
ever it shou'd, wou'd, every Bale of it, be
an incredible Advantage to <HI>England,</HI> and
a Disadvantage to <HI>France.</HI> And 'tis hop'd
that an extraordinary Case, which can
never in the ordinary Course of Trade
happen again, will not be look'd upon a
sufficient Reason to break into an Act,
which is the support of our Navigation.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
That it cannot be thus now, is plain,
and the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants have made it
appear so, by the Calculation of the Price
of Silk at <HI>Leghorn</HI> and at <HI>London;</HI> which
generally is, and for the last three Years
has been, from 1 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> to 2 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d. per lb.</HI>
cheaper in <HI>London</HI> than at <HI>Leghorn;</HI>
which is a sure Rule to judge by, why
this Importation cannot be considerable;
for that Merchants never extend or con∣tinue
a Trade that they cannot carry on
but to Loss. Nor, indeed, can there ever
be any considerable Importation of Raw
Silk from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> but when the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company, by their oppressive Limitati∣ons,
and other monopolizing Arts, restrain
or with-hold the Importation of a Quan∣tity
sufficient for the Market, on purpose
to advance the Price for their private
Gain. And this Engrossing is so easy to
them, such a Grievance to Trade, and so
injurious to our Manufactures in <HI>England,</HI>
that even the Possibility of their doing so
is an unanswerable Reason against their
Bill, and proves, that it not only is not
NECESSARY, as they pretend, but that
it is absolutely necessary their Power of
imposing upon the Market, as above,
should be restrain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
The <HI>second Head,</HI> is the Quantity
which they pretend is Imported, to which
the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants have annex'd no E∣vidence,
expecting to be taken upon their
Words. This Quantity they alledge to
be about an hundred Bales a Year; but
this the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants deny, and ap∣peal
to the Custom-House Books for their
Proof: Also they have prov'd, at the House
of Commons, that in the current Year, all
the Raw Silk imported at <HI>Leghorn</HI> from
<HI>France,</HI> amounts to no more than thirty
six Bales: And that <HI>Italy,</HI> for expence of
their own Silk Manufacture, annually
uses two or three hundred Bales of <HI>Turky</HI>
Raw Silk.</P>
<P>The last is, That this is injurious to
the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade; and this they explain
two Ways:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That it is the Return of the <HI>French</HI>
Cloths sold in <HI>Turky,</HI> and conse∣quently
assists the <HI>French</HI> in their
Sale of Cloth in <HI>Turky.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it ruins the Market for the
<HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk here at <HI>London,</HI> by
sinking the Price of it so, as to make
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
the Merchant lose by his Goods, or
keep them on his Hands unsold.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is incumbent on the <HI>Levant</HI>
Company to prove, which they only bare∣ly
asserted; when, on the contrary, the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants prov'd, that from <HI>Leg∣horn,</HI>
according to the constant course of
Trade, all the <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk imported
from <HI>Italy,</HI> was the Return of <HI>English</HI>
Manufactures: And to this they offer'd to
call Merchants who had resided there for
these Forty Years last past.</P>
<P>To the <HI>second,</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants
say, That the affording all Commodities
to our Manufactures cheap, is a General
Benefit; and the Importing them dear,
will make our Neighbours under-sell us.</P>
<P>Now, neither of these being true, as
above, how will it appear that this Trade
is injurious to the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade from and
to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Appearance of these Things being
thus, and all these Pretences for the Bill
being thus repeal'd and expos'd, it leads
me to the original Design of the <HI>Turky</HI>
Merchant's pushing this Affair so warmly,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
and to enquire what must be the true
Reasons for their desiring the Bill to stop
the Importation of so small a Quantity
of Raw Silk, as, <HI>communibus annis,</HI> is
brought into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>And this Question necessarily carries
me back to view the State of the <HI>Turky</HI>
Trade, which I shall study to do as clear∣ly
and with as much Brevity as I have
done the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Trade to <HI>Turky</HI> is carry'd on in a
Company; their Charter, their Privileges,
their Manner of carrying on their Trade
is known. The Number of Persons con∣cern'd
in their Trade, or Free of their
Company, is great; they tell us, they are
above Two Hundred; and others may,
and indeed all, even the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants
themselves, may be Free of this Company,
paying the usual Fine at their Admission,
and taking the Freedom of the City also.</P>
<P>But, I suppose, it will not be contend∣ed,
that the Gross of the Trade to <HI>Tur∣ky</HI>
is carry'd on by a very few Men, and
even of those few, a yet fewer Number
have the governing Influence of the Trade,
and can go far, very far, to limit the
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
rest by their Interest, to Ship or not to
Ship, Trade or not to Trade, as their
Quantities of Goods, Abroad or at Home,
want a Market, or want a Price.</P>
<P>And as this is an Article which renders
the Company a most effectual Monopoly,
when they make Use of it; so it is evi∣dent,
that it is but a little while since
they did effectually make Use of it, to
the great Injury of the Trade; and this
Power, together with an Oath every Mer∣chant
must take, if he will come in to be
Free of this Company, and which subjects
him to be subject to such monopolizing
Arts as those, is the Reason why the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
Merchants have always declin'd the
Company, and carry'd on their Trade to
<HI>Turky</HI> by the Way of <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>In Favour of this Trade, which, as it
is a fair and just Branch of Commerce,
and was found to be very considerable;
but above all, as it was found to be a
just Check upon the <HI>Turky</HI> Company,
and calculated to prevent the Encroach∣ment
they were always apt to run into
for their private Ends, to the Injury of
the <HI>English</HI> Trade and Art of Navigation,
a Law particularly calculated for the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Encouragement of Trade, and the En∣crease
of our Shipping, thought fit, by a
Clause on Purpose, to make Provision for
the Trade of the said <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants,
and that they shou'd be allow'd to im∣port
the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Goods by Way of <HI>Leg∣horn.</HI></P>
<P>And
here, I must say, lies the whole
Stress of the Bill now depending: It is
this Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> by the Way of
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> that the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants push
at. The bringing some <HI>French</HI> Raw Silk
by Accident, and on an extraordinary Oc∣casion,
when it may be very cheap in
<HI>France,</HI> and very dear in <HI>England;</HI> this is
made the specious Pretence, but is nothing
in the Case; it is the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's
Trading to <HI>Turky, Viâ Leghorn,</HI> that is
the Grievance. This is that they shoot
at, tho' they set up the other as a Blind.</P>
<P>To clear themselves of this, and if
they would have the House believe them
to be as good Patriots as they pretend,
why do they not declare openly, that
they desire nothing but to prevent the
bringing in <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk bought of
the <HI>French,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> may not be
encourag'd to carry on the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
to their Disadvantage, and to send greater
Quantities of <HI>French</HI> Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> and
the like?</P>
<P>Had this been the real and only Thing
they had sought, what Need had they to
strike at the Root of the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade,
which is so much more considerable and
advantageous than their own? Why Pe∣tition
for the Repeal of a Clause, which
admits them to bring Home the Returns
of their Trade to <HI>Turky?</HI> Why had they
not only pray'd, that an ACT might
pass to prohibit Raw Silk from <HI>France</HI> be∣ing
imported by Way of <HI>Leghorn?</HI> in
which all the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants would
readily have concurr'd, and are still ready
to do it.</P>
<P>Or, on the other hand, if they were
not asham'd at thus publickly aiming to
monopolize both the Cloth Trade in <HI>Tur∣ky,</HI>
and the Silk Trade in <HI>England;</HI> I
say, if they were not asham'd of such an
open Attempt to engross an exclusive
Trade, and that they could think a House
of Commons, the Guardians of Liberty,
could be capable of being brought into
such an Invasion of the Liberties of Trade,
why did they not petition fairly, That
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants might not carry
<HI>English;</HI> Cloths, and Tin into <HI>Turky Viâ
Leghorn;</HI> or, in a Word, that, if they
did, they should not be allow'd to bring
back the Returns of it into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This had been, indeed, to have acted
with less Cunning, but with more Ho∣nesty,
than to aim and strike fairly at
this Prohibition, under Pretence of pro∣hibiting
bringing in <HI>French Turky</HI> Silk;
a Thing, which, as it is prov'd, is seldom
done, so it is plain it can never be done,
but to our Advantage, and the Loss of
the <HI>French</HI> Merchants; <HI>unless it be,</HI> as
above, <HI>when the</HI> Turky <HI>Merchants have
put the Dice upon</HI> the Market, <HI>and rais'd
the Price to an unreasonable and injurious
Heighth;</HI> and then the Refuge of a <HI>French</HI>
Market, or of any other Market, would
be but a Justice to the Manufactures, and
a just Check upon the Engrossers.</P>
<P>It seems necessary, in the next Place,
to give a short State of this <HI>By-Trade,</HI> as
they would call it, from <HI>Italy</HI> to <HI>Turky,</HI>
or from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Turky,</HI> by Way of
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
The <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants take much Pains
to represent this Article as very small and
inconsiderable; but why then do they
not propose to the Parliament, that in the
Bill they solicit for, a Clause be reserv'd
for leaving this little, small, inconsidera∣ble
Trade entirely free, and its Returns
free to be brought Home? If it be small,
the Damage to them must likewise be
small: Why is it so hotly oppos'd and
attack'd, if it were really so small and
inconsiderable, as they represent it? I can
answer for the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, that
they would not have struggled with them
for the preserving it; and even the Op∣position
made to them by the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chants,
is an Evidence to all the World,
that it is very far from being a small and
inconsiderable Trade.</P>
<P>By this very Thing the whole Quarrel
may be decided: If the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants
aim only at, and desire only the prevent∣ing
the bringing <HI>French Turky</HI> Silk hither,
and are willing to leave the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade
to <HI>Turky,</HI> and back to <HI>England,</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> open, as it always was,
let them say so; ask for that, and the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants will heartily join with
them; but, while they thus push at one
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
Thing, under Pretence of another, they
most plainly discover what they endeavour
to conceal.</P>
<P>It is meet, therefore, to put this Af∣fair
in a clear Light. The <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chants
Trade to <HI>Turky</HI> by Way of <HI>Leg∣horn,</HI>
is far from being small or inconsi∣derable;
they export and sell in <HI>Turky</HI>
from 40 to 50 Thousand Pounds a Year
in <HI>English</HI> Cloth, and in Tin, Lead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a considerable Sum, and they bring back
the Returns of it to <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>Great Part of those Returns being sold
in <HI>Italy,</HI> the Produce of which must be
clear Gain to the Publick Stock of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> it would be very hard, if they
should be deny'd the Privilege of <HI>English</HI>
Men, and of bringing Home the rest to
sell in their own Country, as Markets
may present.</P>
<P>Except in the Cases already mention'd,
they bring no Silk from <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and
nothing but the Exorbitances of the <HI>Tur∣ky</HI>
Company imposing upon the Markets,
as before, can make it practicable. If the
House thinks fit, even to prevent it under
those Exorbitances, they submit it wholly
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
to the Wisdom of Parliament; but they
humbly hope they have a Right of Pro∣perty,
in common with the rest of his
Majesty's faithful Subjects, to bring back,
and vend in open Market, the Returns of
the <HI>English</HI> Woollen Cloths, and other
Products of their own Country, which
they export, and without which they can∣not
carry on their Trade.</P>
<P>While the Company oppose so just a
Request, how can they take it ill, that
we say they are a dangerous Monopoly?
and how can they clear themselves of
the Charge, while they seek to be the
only Exporters of Cloth to the whole
<HI>Turkish</HI> Empire, and the only Importers
of Raw Silk to the King's Dominions?
Is it not plain, that in this Case they would
consult their own Advantages rather than
the Demands or Occasions of the Manu∣facturers?</P>
<P>This
is the Article the Company visi∣bly
press for; and it cannot be deny'd but
it is of great Consequence to them, that
is to say, to them personally, and as a
Company: but the more it is so, of the
more fatal Consequence would it be to
the Trade in general, seeing they would,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
as above, put their own Price upon their
Woollen Cloth at home, to the Impove∣rishing,
if not Destruction of the Manu∣facturer;
and their own Price upon their
Silk at Home: Nor would it weigh with
them, that by this Conduct they would
lessen the Consumption of <HI>English</HI> Cloth
in <HI>Turky;</HI> and, to hold it up to a Price,
for their private Gain, keep it always
scarce at Market, forbidding their Mem∣bers
in <HI>England</HI> to ship but in general
Ships, sometimes once a Year, sometimes
once in two Years, or more, as they think
fit; without regarding, that by this
Means there would be many Thousands
of Cloths less exported than the Markets
would otherwise carry off, to the irrepa∣rable
Damage and Discouragement of
Woollen Manufactures, and the Encou∣ragement
of the <HI>French;</HI> and the Ruin
of the Clothiers, who, when they had
made large Quantities of Cloth for the
<HI>Turky</HI> Trade, must be oblig'd to keep
them on Hand, or, perhaps, sell them
under Price to two or three rich money'd
Men, who make Use of the Necessities
of the poor Clothiers for that very Ad∣vantage;
all which still proclaims them
a Sett of Monopolizers, in the worst
Sense of the Word.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
And this very Practice throws another
Charge back upon them, which they ne∣ver
can get off from, and which they now
endeavour to put upon the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chants,
<HI>viz.</HI> That whereas they alledge,
that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants are the Sup∣porter
of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> (the
contrary of which is manifest,) the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company, by not duly supplying the
Markets, by laying Mulcts and Restraints
upon the <HI>English</HI> Cloth which comes there
by Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> by swearing their
Factors and Servants not to sell any of
their Goods, but for present Payment;
whereas the <HI>French</HI> give Credit, where
there is any Certainty or Security of be∣ing
paid. By these, I say, and many such
like Methods, they are themselves the
Encouragers, and, indeed, the Supporters
of the <HI>French</HI> Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI> who, on
the contrary, were the Markets constant∣ly
and fully supply'd, and proper Mea∣sures
for Trade pursu'd, as would be, if
the Trade were open'd, as it might be,
would not be able to vend one quarter
Part of the Cloth which they now sell
there. I do not mean by this, totally to
lay open the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, but humbly
hope your Lordships, in your great Wis∣dom,
will put it on the foot the <HI>Russia</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Company was, by an Act of the 11<SUP>th</SUP> of
King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and I do
believe such an Act would effectually drive
the <HI>French</HI> out of the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, and
have the same effect that had, <HI>viz.</HI> That
instead of six or seven Sail of Ships the
then <HI>Russia</HI> Company annually employ'd,
and the now <HI>Turky</HI> Company annually em∣ploys,
the next Year the <HI>Russia</HI> Merchants
sent 40 Sail of Ships, and do now annually
employ above a hundred and twenty, and
our <HI>English</HI> Manufactories are now carry'd
to Places where before they were never so
much as heard of: And this would be
the Case of the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade, were the
<HI>Levant</HI> Company regulated by a like
Act of Parliament; and the Honour
of the <HI>English</HI> Nation kept up with a
much less Charge on our Manufactures
than it now is; for the Trade being more
diffusive, half <HI>per Cent.</HI> instead of two,
would be sufficient to defray the necessary
National Charge.</P>
<P>So that, in a Word, it is the <HI>Turky</HI>
Company who encourage the <HI>French;</HI> and
many Ways this may be made out: As
for Example, the 23<HI>d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1707, by
laying a Mulct of five Dollars <HI>per</HI> Cloth
on all <HI>English</HI> Cloth, which comes thither
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> Cloth
comes in Free, forbidding <HI>English</HI> Cloth
from <HI>Leghorn</HI> to come in <HI>English</HI> Ships;
but permitting <HI>English</HI> Ships to bring
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Cloth Free, as above.
They tell us, if we <HI>stop the</HI> French <HI>Silk
from coming hither, we destroy them at
once.</HI> How can they impose this upon
Mankind, when 'tis known, that all the
Cloth the <HI>French</HI> Merchant can send to
<HI>Turky,</HI> will not supply the Demand they
have for Silk in <HI>France?</HI> But they buy
a great deal with ready Money, as was
the Case those two Years 1714 and 1715,
when they lost so much Money by it, as al∣most
ruin'd them all. And what must our
poor Manufacturers have done in <HI>England</HI>
in those two Years, had they not been
supply'd by the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant's buying
that Silk cheap? Is it not evident their
Goods must have cost them here 40 <HI>l.
per Cent.</HI> more than the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Itali∣ans</HI>
cou'd have imported them at; the
Consequence of which must have been,
that our <HI>English</HI> Manufacturers must have
been starv'd, and Wrought Silks, from
all our neighbouring Manufactories, in∣stead
of <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silks, wou'd have
been run in upon us from Abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>
It is deny'd and has already been ex∣plain'd
that <HI>Turky</HI> Raw Silk ever did or
ever can come from <HI>France</HI> hither, by
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> in the ordinary Course
of Trade: 'Tis plain, it can never come
but when their Markets in <HI>France</HI> are so
full, and so low, as that they must sell
it to great Loss; or when our Markets,
starv'd by the Cunning of the Company,
are so extravagantly dear, that to reduce
the Price will be our Gain; so that, in
short, to bring the <HI>Turky</HI> Silk in either
of those two Junctures, will be always to
our Gain, and to the Loss of the <HI>French.</HI>
And in which of these two lies the Ad∣vantage
to <HI>France,</HI> I would fain have these
Gentlemen answer.</P>
<P>But let us examine next, what Disad∣vantage
the <HI>Turky</HI> Company can pretend
to suffer from the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade: Can any
Merchants complain of the Competitors,
who cannot trade under them, but at a
Disadvantage of 10 or 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and,
if they please, 20 or 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> unless
Means can be found to evade the Force of
their Impositions; it cannot be, the Ad∣vantage
must lie somewhere else, and it
is manifest it does so, <HI>viz.</HI> in the having
Power, by an exclusive Trade, to impose
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
other Rates and Prices upon the Markets
Abroad and at Home, than they have ever
yet been able to do: This it is they aim
at, and this they find they can come at
no other Way, but by putting a Stop to
the Merchants sending Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> by
Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and bringing back the
Silk to <HI>London;</HI> and this they cannot ex∣pect,
but by perswading the World to be∣lieve,
than which <HI>nothing can be more
false,</HI> that this Silk comes from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Again, to prove the Inconsistence of
this Pretence, I would desire those Mer∣chants
to calculate the Price which this
Silk costs the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turky,</HI>
whether it be bought for Cloth or for
Money; let them add to it the Charges
of carrying first to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> then bring∣it
from <HI>Marseilles</HI> to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> then ship∣ping
it again for <HI>England,</HI> Commission in
all those Places, and Charges of sundry
Sorts, also Insurance, and the like; and
then let them take the Price in <HI>France</HI> and
at <HI>London,</HI> at the same Time, and tell
us if the <HI>French</HI> gain, or lose, by the
Trade: If the <HI>first,</HI> let them prevent it,
by such legal Methods as they shall think
fit; If the <HI>last,</HI> which I affirm is true,
what can be the Meaning of so warmly
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
engaging against a Trade which the <HI>French</HI>
lose Money by.</P>
<P>I observe, in several of the Cases given
out by the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, they would
be thought very popular, and claim it of
the World, that they are the great Encou∣ragers
of the Woollen Manufacture, and
that they not only export great Quanti∣ties,
but that they take all proper Mea∣sures
to encourage the Consumption of it
in the Country whither they carry it.</P>
<P>But, were this true, how comes it, that
there are so many By-Laws for the Dis∣couraging
any one to bring it thither but
themselves; such as laying a Mulct, or
Duty, of 25 Dollars <HI>per</HI> Bale, upon all
the <HI>English</HI> Cloth that shall come by Way
of <HI>Leghorn,</HI> not allowing it to be brought
in <HI>English</HI> Ships, when, at the same Time,
<HI>as before,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Cloth, <HI>as
I have observ'd already,</HI> may come in <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Bottoms; also forbidding their Fa∣ctors
there to sell any <HI>English</HI> Cloth, but
for the Company, and the like.</P>
<P>Let any indifferent Person judge, whe∣ther
this is encouraging, or whether it is
not rather a visible Combination to dis∣courage
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
and destroy the Trade of our <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Cloth in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>With what Assurance can these Men
bring a Rabble of Packers and Cloth-Dressers,
Clothiers, and Dyers, and other
Mechanicks, up to the Door of the House
to solicit in their Cause, as if the whole
Manufacture was concern'd? which is
making the poor ignorant Clothworkers
and Manufacturers so many Soliciters a∣gainst
themselves, and bringing them to
be Parties to their own Destruction, as
Manufacturers.</P>
<P>So also they bring the Pewterers and
Dealers in Tin; insinuating, that they
are great Benefactors to the Tin-mines;
supposing, perhaps, that this may have
some Influence on such Members as repre∣sent
the Stannary Towns, and who are
suppos'd to have Estates in the Mines of
Tin in the Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Corn∣wal:</HI>
But are they so ignorant as to ima∣gine,
that the <HI>Cornish</HI> Gentlemen do not
know that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants are
much greater Exporters of Tin than the
<HI>Turky</HI> Merchants, even to above double
the Quantity, and that as well to <HI>Turky</HI>
as <HI>Italy?</HI> Which Things if duly known,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
and if the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants were as much
enclin'd to make themselves popular, and
needeed it as these Men do, would pre∣sently
bring the Manufacturers, Dyers,
Dealers in Tin, and the like, to appear
on their Side, rather than on the other.</P>
<P>But I leave all these little Things, as
Artifices too mean to be taken Notice of,
and fit only to assist a bad Cause. I come
next to enter into the Merit of this Que∣stion,
with Regard to the Navigation. It
must be of some Concern to let the World
see how many Ways this Company, who
value themselves so highly, are an Ob∣struction
and Discouragement to our Na∣vigation,
and to the employing both Ship∣ping
and Seamen, even in this very Trade,
in which they would pretend to recom∣mend
themselves.</P>
<P>They were indeed enquir'd of at the
Bar of the House, how many Ships they
employ'd to <HI>Turky</HI> in a Year, and tho'
I hear they answer'd falsly, and said,
Ten; which is more than they employ,
and in some Years send none at all; yet,
at best, what Number of Ships is this
to boast of, or to give them any Claim
to be Encouragers of Navigation?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
On the other hand, the <HI>Italian</HI> Mer∣chants
alledge, That they hinder, by
their Limitations upon the Trade, ten
times more Ships being employ'd than all
the Trade they carry on employs. Tho'
they have all the Grand Seigniors Domi∣nions
for their Trade, the others only <HI>I∣taly,</HI>
they employ 6 or 7 Ships a Year,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Trade near 150, to 200, ma∣ny
of which lie mouldring in Port, while
the <HI>French</HI> and other foreign Vessels
(Thanks to the Company's By Laws and
Restrictions) run away with all the
Freights to <HI>Turky,</HI> whilst our Ships, for
want of Employ as usual in the <HI>Levant,</HI>
are oblig'd to return home Empty.</P>
<P>Which Way shall these Men be discours'd
with? Let impartial Men but hear their
Argument: How incoherent! How in∣consistent
with itself! If they talk of our
Importation to <HI>England,</HI> 'tis exceeding
great. On the other hand, if they talk
of our Exportation from <HI>England,</HI> 'tis ex∣ceeding
small, tho' we vend and send 40
or 50000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year in <HI>English</HI> Cloth to
<HI>Turky,</HI> by Way of <HI>Leghorn,</HI></P>
<P>If we speak of our Trade to <HI>Turky,</HI>
they tell us, one Ship a Year will bring
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
all our Returns, and there is not above
500 Cloths a Year brought into <HI>Turky;</HI>
and yet, at the same Time, speak of our
Returns as a Thing fatal to their Trade.
To avoid the Absurdity of these Things,
they insist and affirm, That the Silk we
import, is from <HI>France;</HI> offering nothing
to prove it, but their affirming positively,
that it is so; the Credit of which the
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchants desire to be excus'd, as
to their giving any Weight to, and as
positively deny it.</P>
<P>But there is a Way how the <HI>Turky</HI> Mer∣chants
may obtain all that they ask'd, and
which, if it may be obtain'd, no Cloth
will be carry'd to <HI>Turky, Viâ Leghorn,</HI> any
more; and no Raw Silk be brought from
<HI>France, Viâ Leghorn,</HI> any more; no Cla∣mour
against the <HI>Turky</HI> Company's being
a Monopoly, will be made any more; no
Interruption to our Navigation will be
made by the Company more; but the
Trade will flourish, the Company will be
enrich'd, and the Nation also: And this
is but by <HI>laying open the Trade</HI> to all Man∣kind,
on the foot of the <HI>Russia</HI> Company,
to trade freely and unconfin'd; to send
out Ships when they will, and by what
Ways they will; and every body being
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
left to push their own Trade, there is no
doubt but the Grand Seignior's Domini∣ons,
and the Kingdoms and Countries of
<HI>Persia, Georgia, Armenia,</HI> and the <HI>Caspian</HI>
Sea, might, if Encouragement was given
them, consume much more <HI>English</HI> Cloth
than is now sold among them.</P>
<P>This, and no other, is the Way effectu∣ally
to encrease the Trade, to Ruin the
<HI>French</HI> Manufactories of Cloth, and to
encourage both the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture
and Navigation; and, in this Case, a few
Years wou'd bring the <HI>Turky</HI> Trade not to
employ seven Ships a Year, but seventy,
and perhaps, sevenscore Ships.</P>
<P>For then wou'd all the Trade be en∣courag'd
together, and those Ships that
had a Hundred, and perhaps two Hundred
Bales of Cloth on Board, wou'd run away,
take in Freight for other Places, as for
<HI>Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Messina,</HI> and so
to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> or <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and thus,
instead of few Ships; there wou'd be ma∣ny
Sail in a Year employ'd.</P>
<P>And then the Trade wou'd appear, as it
indeed is, very considerable; whereas now
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
tis contracted, 'tis limited; and indeed by
those Limitations 'tis almost quite lost.</P>
<P>The <HI>Russian</HI> Company is an Instance of
this, who, while they were under the like
Limitations as the <HI>Turky</HI> Company, sent
usually 6 or 7 Ships a Year to <HI>Archangel,</HI>
whereas they now employ above 120 Sail
of large Ships a Year, one Year with ano∣ther;
and they export infinitely more
Woollen Manufactures to that Country,
than ever they did before; and thus push∣ing
the Trade on with all the Art, and
with the utmost Diligence, they have
brought Infinite Numbers more of People
to use the <HI>British</HI> Manufacture, than ever
used it before.</P>
<P>The like is before us, and the like Ad∣vantages
offer themselves; for by this one
Act, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>of laying the Trade open,</HI> In∣dustry
wou'd have her Hands at liberty,
to struggle and to push the Trade into
Countries, and among Inhabitants that
were never heard of before. Methods
wou'd then be used by the vigilant Mer∣chant,
to send his Goods, and to sell his
Goods, without exacting ready Money
where Payment was sure; leaving the
Factor a discretionary Power to act as for
himself.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41"/>
As The Trade wou'd thus be better'd,
so the Encouragement to Shipping, the
Encrease of Seamen, and above all, the
Consumption of our Manufactures wou'd
be enlarg'd, and then the Mock-Complaint
of the Importation of Raw Silk from <HI>Mar∣seilles,</HI>
wou'd be at an End; neither wou'd
there be any Occasion of a Bill to prevent
the Importation of <HI>Asiatick</HI> Goods from
<HI>Leghorn;</HI> every Merchant having a Li∣berty,
in the Course of his own Business,
to bring away the Returns directly.</P>
<P>Likewise as a far greater Number of
Ships wou'd go to <HI>Turky,</HI> having but Part
of their Loading thither, from <HI>England,</HI> and
having the Liberty, to take in Goods for
<HI>Leghorn, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI> in their
Way to <HI>Turky;</HI> so, in their Return, ha∣ving
Part of their Loading for <HI>Italy</HI> or
<HI>England,</HI> there being a constant Trade to
and from <HI>Turky</HI> to <HI>Italy,</HI> the Freight of
which is considerable, they will be ena∣bled
to take the rest of their Loading in
<HI>Italian</HI> Goods at <HI>Messina, Naples,</HI> or <HI>Leg∣hosn,</HI>
as Opportunity presents, or as their
Employers direct. So that in this Case,
the End of the Act of Navigation, which,
as I said before, was to encrease and en∣courage
<HI>English</HI> Seamen and <HI>English</HI> Ship∣ping,
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
especially Ships of Force, wou'd
much better be answer'd, than by carry∣ing
on a narrow contracted Trade, as
now they do, manag'd by about thirty
Merchants only; and those Thirty ma∣nagd
again by Two or Three, by which
the whole Commerce is straighten'd, the
Consumption of <HI>English</HI> Cloth hinder'd,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> encourag'd to
carry Cloth to <HI>Turky,</HI> and worm us out
of the Trade.</P>
<P>This laying open the Trade may with
Ease be so regulated, as that the Ambas∣sadors,
Consuls, and other Officers neces∣sary
to act there, may be still maintain'd,
and all the necessary Expences of the
Trade be supply'd, either by the Com∣merce
itself, or by the Publick, for which
suitable Provision may be made, as to the
Wisdom of the Parliament shall seem meet.
And for the compleat and easy Direction
Whereof, a Scheme of suitable Measures
shall be presented to the House, when∣ever
such a Thing shall come upon the
Stage; nor is there any Doubt to be made
but that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants will be
able to answer all the Objections that can
be justly brought against such a Change
of the Company's Constitution.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
By the aforesaid Case (which I think
I have stated impartially) it is humbly
hop'd that the <HI>Italian</HI> Merchants, as <HI>En∣glishmen,</HI>
have a natural Right to the
Trade to the Grand Seignier's Dominions.
I shall only give the Heads of some few
restrictive Orders, and instance others,
whereby they have Tax'd our Woollen
Manufactures and Navigation, and pro∣hibited
even their own Members from
Trading in such Manner and at such
Times as they thought proper, and your
Lordships may then judge, whether a
Company with Power, or assuming a
Power, to make restrictive Laws, be a
Monopoly or not.</P>
