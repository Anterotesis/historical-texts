<HEAD>A FURTHER ACCOUNT Of the most Deplorable Condition Of Mr. <HI>EDMUND CURLL,</HI> Bookseller.</HEAD>
<P>THE Publick is already ac∣quainted with the Man∣ner of Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Impoi∣sonment, by a faithful, tho' unpolite, Historian of <HI>Grub∣street.</HI> I am but the Continu∣er of his History; yet I hope a due Distinction will be made, be∣tween an undignify'd Scribler of a Sheet and half, and the Author of
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
a Three-Penny stitcht Book, like my self.</P>
<P><HI>Wit</HI> (saith Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>) <HI>proceeds from a Concurrence of regular and exalted Ferments, and an Afflu∣ence of Animal Spirits rectify'd and refin'd to a degree of Purity.</HI> On the contrary, when the igneous Parti∣cle rise with the vital Liquor, they produce an Abstraction of the rati∣onal Part of the Soul, which we commonly call <HI>Madness.</HI> The Ve∣rity of this Hypothesis, is justify'd by the Symptoms with which the unfortunate Mr. <HI>Edmund Curll,</HI> Bookseller, hath been afflicted e∣ver since his swallowing the Poison at the <HI>Swan</HI> Tavern in <HI>Fleetstreet.</HI> For tho' the <HI>Neck</HI> of his <HI>Retort,</HI> which carries up the Animal Spi∣rits to the Head, is of an extraordi∣nary Length, yet the said Animal Spirits rise muddy, being contami∣nated with the inflammable Parti∣cles of this uncommon Poison.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
The Symptoms of his Departure from his usual Temper of Mind, were at first only <HI>speaking civilly to his Customers,</HI> taking a Fancy to <HI>say his Prayers, singeing a Pig with a new purchas'd Libel,</HI> and <HI>refusing Two and Nine Pence for Sir</HI> R<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/><HI>'s Essays.</HI></P>
<P>As the poor Man's Frenzy in∣creas'd, he began to <HI>void his Excre∣ments in his Bed, read</HI> Rochester<HI>'s bawdy Poems to his Wife,</HI> gave <HI>Oldmix∣on</HI> a <HI>slap</HI> on the <HI>Chops,</HI> and wou'd have kiss'd Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI>'s A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> <HI>by Violence.</HI></P>
<P>But at last he came to such a pass, that he wou'd <HI>dine upon nothing but Copper Plates,</HI> took a <HI>Clyster for a whipt Syllabub,</HI> and eat a <HI>Suppository</HI> for a <HI>Raddish</HI> with <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Butter.</HI></P>
<P>We leave it to every tender Wife to imagine how sorely all this afflict∣ed poor Mrs. <HI>Curll:</HI> At first she pri∣vately put a <HI>Bill</HI> into several <HI>Church∣es,</HI> desiring the Prayers of the Con∣gregation
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
for a <HI>wretched Stationer</HI> distemper'd in Mind. But when she was sadly convinc'd that his Misfortune was publick to all the World, writ the following Letter to her good Neighbour Mr. <HI>Lintott.</HI>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>A true Copy of Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Letter to Mr. <HI>Lintott.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU, and all the Neighbours know too well, the Frenzy with which my poor Man is visi∣ted. I never perceiv'd he was out of himself, till that melancholy Day that he thought he was poi∣son'd in a Glass of Sack; upon this, he took a strange Fancy to run a Vomiting all over the House, and in the new wash'd Dining Room. Alas! this is the greatest Adversity that ever befel my poor Man since he lost <HI>one Testicle</HI> at School by the bite of a black Boar. Good Lord! if he should die, where should I dis∣pose of the Stock? unless Mr. <HI>Pem∣berton</HI> or you would help a distressed
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Widow; for God knows he never publish'd any Books that lasted a∣bove a Week, so that if we want∣ed <HI>daily Books,</HI> we wanted <HI>daily Bread.</HI> I can write no more, for I hear the Rap of Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s <HI>Ivory headed Cane</HI> upon the Coun∣ter.—Pray recommend me to your <HI>Pastry Cook,</HI> who furnishes you yearly with Tarts in exchange for your Papers, for Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> has dis∣oblig'd ours since his Fits came up∣on him;—before that, we gene∣rally liv'd upon bak'd Meats.—He is coming in, and I have but just time to put his Son out of the way for fear of Mischief: So wish∣ing you a merry Easter, I remain your</P>

But return we to Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> who all <HI>Wednesday</HI> continued outragiously Mad. On <HI>Thursday</HI> he had a <HI>lucid In∣terval,</HI> that enabled him to send a general Summons to all <HI>his Authors.</HI> There was but one Porter who cou'd perform this Office, to whom he gave the following Bill of Directions where to find 'em. This Bill, to∣gether with Mrs. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Original Letter, lye at Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s Shop to be perus'd by the Curious.</P>

All these Gentlemen appear'd at the Hour appointed, in Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Dining Room, two excepted; one of whom was the Gentleman in the Cock-loft, his Landlady being out of the way, and the <HI>Gradus ad Par∣nassum</HI> taken down; the other hap∣pened to be too closely watch'd by the Bailiffs.</P>
<P>They no sooner enter'd the Room, but all of them show'd in their Be∣haviour some Suspicion of each o∣ther; some turning away their Heads with an Air of Contempt; others squinting with a Leer that show'd at once Fear and Indignation, each with a haggard abstracted Mien, the lively Picture of <HI>Scorn, Solitude,</HI> and <HI>short Commons.</HI> So when a Keeper feeds his hungry Charge, of Vul∣tures, Panthers, and of <HI>Lybian</HI> Leo∣pards, each eyes his Fellow with a fiery Glare: High hung, the bloody Liver tempts their Maw. Or as a Housewife stands before her Pales, surrounded by her Geese; they fight,
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
they hiss, they gaggle, beat their Wings, and Down is scatter'd as the Winter's Snow, for a poor Grain of Oat, or Tare, or Barley. Such Looks shot thro' the Room transverse, oblique, direct; such was the stir and din, till <HI>Curll</HI> thus spoke, (but with∣out rising from his Close-stool.) <Q REND="inline"><P>'<HI>Whores</HI> and <HI>Authors</HI> must be paid beforehand to put them in good Humour; therefore here is half a Crown a piece for you to drink your own Healths, and Confusion to Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> and all other success∣ful Writers.'</P>
<P>'Ah Gentlemen! What have I not done, what have I not suffer'd, rather than the World should be depriv'd of your Lucubrations? I have taken involuntary Purges, I have been vomited, three Times have I been can'd, once was I hun∣ted, twice was my Head broke by a Grenadier, twice was I toss'd in a Blanket; I have had Boxes on the Ear, Slaps on the Chops; I
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
have been frighted, pump'd, kick'd, slander'd and beshitten.—I hope, Gentlemen, you are all convinc'd that this Author of Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s could mean nothing else but starving you by poisoning me. It remains for us to consult the best and speediest Methods of Revenge.'</P></Q></P>
<P>He had scarce done speaking, but the <HI>Historian</HI> propos'd a History of his Life. The <HI>Exeter</HI> Exchange Gentle∣man was for penning Articles of his Faith. Some pretty smart <HI>Pindarick,</HI> (says the Red-Stocking Gentleman,) would effectually do his Business. But the <HI>Index-maker</HI> said their was no∣thing like an <HI>Index</HI> to his <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>After several Debates they came to the following Resolutions.<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That every Member of this Society, according to his se∣veral Abilities, shall contribute some way or other to the Defama∣tion of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That towards the Li∣belling of the said Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> there be a Summ employ'd not exceed∣ing Six Pounds Sixteen Shillings and Nine Pence (not including Advertisements.)</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> make an Affidevit before Mr. <HI>Justice Tully,</HI> that in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer,</HI> there are several Passages contra∣ry to the establish'd Rules of OUR Sublime.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolved,</HI> That he has on Pur∣pose in several Passages perverted the true ancient <HI>Heathen</HI> Sense of <HI>Homer,</HI> for the more effectual Pro∣pagation of the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That the Printing of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Battles at this Juncture, has been the Occasion of all the Disturbances of this Kingdom.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ordered,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Barnivelt</HI> be invited to be a Member of this So∣ciety,
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
in order to make further Discoveries.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv</HI>'d, That a number of ef∣fective <HI>Errata</HI>'s be raised out of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Homer</HI> (not exceeding 1746.) and that every Gentleman, who shall send in one Error, for his Encouragement shall have the whole Works of this Society <HI>Gra∣tis.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That a Summ not ex∣ceeding Ten Shillings and Six-pence be distributed among the Members of this Society for <HI>Coffee</HI> and <HI>To∣bacco,</HI> in order to enable them the more effectually to defame him in <HI>Coffee-Houses.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That towards the fur∣ther lessening the Character of the said Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> some Persons be de∣puted to abuse him at Ladies <HI>Tea Tables,</HI> and that in Consideration our Authors are not <HI>well dress'd</HI> enough, Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y</HI> be deputed for that Service.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That a <HI>Ballad</HI> be made against Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> and that Mr. <HI>Oldmixon,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Centlivre</HI> do prepare and bring in the same.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That above all, some effectual Ways and Means be found to encrease the Joint Stock of the Reputation of this Society, which at present is exceedingly low, and to give their Works the greater Currency; whether by raising the Denomination of the said Works by counterfeit Title Pages, or mixing a greater Quantity of the fine Me∣tal of other Authors, with the Al∣loy of this Society.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That no Member of this Society for the future mix <HI>Stout</HI> in his <HI>Ale</HI> in a Morning, and that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> remove from the <HI>Her∣cules</HI> and <HI>Still.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That all our Members, (except the <HI>Cook's</HI> Wife) be provi∣ded
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
with a sufficient Quantity of the <HI>vivifying Drops,</HI> Or <HI>Byfield's Sal Volatile.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Resolv'd,</HI> That Sir <HI>R. B.</HI> be ap∣pointed to endue this Society with a large Quantity of <HI>regular and ex∣alted Ferments,</HI> in order to <HI>enliven</HI> their <HI>cold Sentiments</HI> (being his true Receipt to make Wits)</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These Resolutions being taken, the Assembly was ready to break up, but they took so near a-part in Mr. <HI>Curll</HI>'s Afflictions, that none of them could leave him without gi∣ving some Advice to re-instate him in his Health.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Gildon</HI> was of Opinion, That in order to drive a <HI>Pope</HI> out of his <HI>Belly,</HI> he should get the Mummy of some deceas'd Moderator of the General Assembly in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to be taken inwardly as an effectual Anti∣dote against Antichrist; but Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> did conceive, that the <HI>Li∣ver</HI> of the Person who administred
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
the Poison, boil'd in Broth, would be a more certain Cure.</P>
<P>While the Company were expe∣cting the Thanks of Mr. <HI>Curll,</HI> for these Demonstrations of their Zeal, a whole Pile of <HI>Essays</HI> on a sudden fell on his Head; the Shock of which in an Instant brought back his Dili∣rium. He immediately rose up, o∣ver-turn'd the Close-stool, and beshit the <HI>Essays</HI> (which may probably oc∣casion a <HI>second Edition</HI>) then without putting up his Breeches, in a most furious Tone, he thus broke out to his Books, which his distemper'd Imagination represented to him as alive, coming down from their Shelves, fluttering their Leaves, and flapping their Covers at him.</P>
<P>Now <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d damn</HI> all <HI>Folio's, Quar∣to's, Octavo's</HI> and <HI>Duodecimo's!</HI> un∣grateful Varlets that you are, who have so long taken up my House with∣out paying for your Lodging?—Are you not the beggarly Brood of fum∣bling <HI>Journey-men;</HI> born in <HI>Garrets,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
among <HI>Lice</HI> and <HI>Cobwebs,</HI> nurs'd up∣on <HI>Grey Peas, Bullocks Liver,</HI> and <HI>Porter's Ale?</HI>—Was not the first Light you saw, the <HI>Farthing</HI> Candle I paid for? Did you not come before your Time into <HI>dirty Sheets</HI> of brown Pa∣per?—And have not I cloath'd you in double <HI>Royal,</HI> lodg'd you hand∣somely on <HI>decent Shelves,</HI> lac'd your <HI>Backs</HI> with <HI>Gold,</HI> equipt you with splendid <HI>Titles,</HI> and sent you into the World with the Names of <HI>Per∣sons of Quality?</HI> Must I be <HI>always</HI> plagu'd with you?—Why flutter ye your Leaves, and flap your Covers at me? Damn ye all, ye <HI>Wolves</HI> in <HI>Sheeps Cloathing; Rags ye were, and to Rags ye shall return.</HI> Why hold you forth your <HI>Texts</HI> to me, ye pal∣try <HI>Sermons?</HI> Why cry ye—at every Word to me, ye <HI>bawdy Poems?</HI>—To my Shop at <HI>Tunbridge</HI> ye shall go, by G<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> and thence be drawn like the rest of your Predecessors, bit by bit, to the <HI>Passage-House:</HI> For in this present Emotion of my Bowels, how do I compassionate those who have
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
great need, and nothing to wipe their Breech with?</P>
<P>Having said this, and at the same Time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped, he abated of his Fury, and with great Gravity, apply'd to that Function the unfinish'd Sheets of the Conduct of the E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> of <HI>N<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>m.</HI></P>
