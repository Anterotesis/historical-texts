AN
EPISTLE
TO A
FRIEND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'<SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG> WERE well, my <HI>Laelius,</HI> if I could pursue,</L>
<L>That prudent Counsel which I had from You:</L>
<L>To quit the Muse before her Spirits sink,</L>
<L>Forsake my Rhymes, and wash my Hands of Ink.</L>
<L>But, spite of all the Precepts You impart,</L>
<L>This Itch of Scribbling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parody of a Line in a late Poem.</NOTE> <HI>clings about my Heart.</HI></L>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<L>'Tis a Disease above the Doctor's Skill,</L>
<L>Too stubborn to be cur'd with <HI>Drop</HI> or <HI>Pill.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND yet, believe me, I have often try'd</L>
<L>To take your fav'rite Maxim for my Guide.</L>
<L><HI>Nil admirari</HI> dwells upon your Tongue:</L>
<L>So <HI>Horace</HI> sings, and I approve his Song.</L>
<L>But like <HI>Medea,</HI> frantic in her Love,</L>
<L>I cannot practise what I thus approve.</L>
<L>Too fond of Verse, I waste my precious Time</L>
<L>In Sounds, and Similies, and worthless Rhyme;</L>
<L>Mad as the Priest, who, in poetic Rage,</L>
<L>With Floods of Nonsense deluges the Stage:</L>
<L>What tho' you damn one Offspring of his Brain?</L>
<L>Prolific Dullness quickly spawns again:</L>
<L>This Monster crush'd, another strait appears,</L>
<L>Head after Head the sprouting Hydra rears;</L>
<L>Despising all the Censures of the Town,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Person's Judgment, but his own;</L>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<L>For tho' pronounc'd a Fool by all the Pit,</L>
<L>He impudently thinks himself a Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A SOBER Countryman, as Stories say,</L>
<L>Would visit <HI>Bedlam</HI> on a certain Day;</L>
<L>Where, as he pitied a poor Wretch's Case,</L>
<L>The merry Madman laugh'd him in the Face,</L>
<L>And cry'd, Alas! your Judgment's very bad,</L>
<L>Believe me, 'tis not I, but You, are mad!</L>
<L>Mankind are run distracted ev'ry where,</L>
<L>All but a few, who keep their Senses <HI>Here.</HI></L>
<L>You see our Madman, tho' prodigious ill,</L>
<L>Was happy in his own Opinion still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR lives a Wretch, so wretched in the Town,</L>
<L>But has some darling Pleasure of his own,</L>
<L>Which he calls Happiness. 'Tis my Delight,</L>
<L>My Pleasure, and my Happiness, to write;</L>
<L>For Happiness we various Ways explore;</L>
<L>Some think it plac'd in Wealth, and some in Pow'r;</L>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<L>Others believe in Luxury it lies,</L>
<L>In Women some, and some in Butterflies.</L>
<L>All other Gifts of Fortune are confin'd,</L>
<L>But Pleasure's free, and common as the Wind:</L>
<L>The Cobler feels it often as the Peer;</L>
<L>One's drown'd in Politics, and one in Beer:</L>
<L>One's pleas'd with Honours, one with being drunk,</L>
<L><HI>This</HI> fondly courts a Ribband, <HI>that</HI> a Punk.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE are who fix their Pleasure in a Race,</L>
<L>Whose Acres lessen, as their Steeds increase;</L>
<L>Some place their Joys in ancient Coins, and some</L>
<L>Admire the curious Busts of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI></L>
<L>Others in Painting all their Fortune waste,</L>
<L>While dunning Tradesmen curse their lavish Taste.</L>
<L>So much they honour the illustrious Dead,</L>
<L>They wrong the Living of their daily Bread.</L>
<L>In Building some consume a vast Estate,</L>
<L>And only leave their Heirs the Walls to eat;</L>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<L>These for a Supper many Hundreds pay,</L>
<L>While those in Music tune their Wealth away.</L>
<L>Thus diff'rent as our Faces are our Views;</L>
<L>Yet each this Harlot <HI>Happiness</HI> pursues;</L>
<L>This common Strumpet is by all ador'd,</L>
<L>She's Mistress to the Fidler, and the Lord.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ONE, whom her Charms unluckily delight,</L>
<L>Courts her at Gaming-tables ev'ry Night:</L>
<L>No matter what her saucy Favours cost,</L>
<L>He will enjoy her till his Fortune's lost;</L>
<L>Careless of what his Wife and Chidren do:</L>
<L>Let Wife and Children starve, what's that to You?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU may condemn our Gamesters, if you please:</L>
<L>But is he more ridiculous than these,</L>
<L>Who count their glitt'ring Dirt essential Bliss?</L>
<L><HI>Umidius</HI> has no other Joy but this.</L>
<L>For Gold he studies, strives, and toils, and sweats;</L>
<L>For Gold he swears, and lyes, and jobs, and cheats.</L>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<L>Full fifty thousand Pounds he has in Store,</L>
<L>And yet he covets fifty thousand more.</L>
<L>No wild Profusion wastes his useless Hoard;</L>
<L>No Soups, or <HI>French</HI> Ragoûs, adorn his Board:</L>
<L>But, left such Diet should provoke his Lust,</L>
<L>He dines, like <HI>Seneca,</HI> upon a Crust;</L>
<L>And thinks the <HI>Turks</HI> Religion most divine,</L>
<L>Because it has forbid them drinking Wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ANOTHER, who <HI>Lucullus</HI> would excel</L>
<L>In the luxurious Arts of eating well,</L>
<L>Plump as a Swine of <HI>Epicurus</HI> looks,</L>
<L>His God his Belly, and his Glory Cooks.</L>
<L>So many Dishes on his Board appear,</L>
<L>'Twould surfeit you to read his Bill of Fare:</L>
<L>And of one Dinner the Expence so large,</L>
<L>Not <HI>Peter</HI> often could support the Charge.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE gay <HI>Adonis,</HI> of a diff'rent Mind,</L>
<L>Counts Love the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> of Mankind.</L>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<L>Love is the great Employment of his Life,</L>
<L>A Passion very pleasing to a Wife:</L>
<L>But Wife he is determin'd to have none;</L>
<L>For our penurious Laws allow but one.</L>
<L>Of willing Nymphs he keeps a mighty Store;</L>
<L>Not <HI>Solomon</HI> himself had many more:</L>
<L>These are his Happiness, tho' Goats may be</L>
<L>Much happier Animals, perhaps, than <HI>he.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ACTEON rides the Fields with rapid Pace;</L>
<L>He feels no Happiness, but in a Chace:</L>
<L>To him the Genius of his Hounds is known,</L>
<L>And <HI>Jowler's</HI> Nature, better than his own.</L>
<L>Ask him if <HI>Jowler</HI> strives to starve her Young?</L>
<L>He'll wonder at the Folly of your Tongue:</L>
<L>Yet he, more cruel, wickedly inclines</L>
<L>To starve the native Issue of his Loins.</L>
<L>Go to thy Dogs, inhuman, thoughtless Elf!</L>
<L>Their Ways consider, and be wise thyself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
<L>LORD <HI>Fickle,</HI> with his virtuous Lady vext,</L>
<L>Weds her one Day, and widows her the next:</L>
<L>'Tis hard to say the Pleasure of his Life;</L>
<L>'Tis plain, however, 'tis not in a Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BIBLUS, with thirsty Throat, and firy Face,</L>
<L>Has fix'd his chiefest Pleasure in a Glass;</L>
<L>Drinking and Dozing are his dear Delight;</L>
<L>All Day he dozes, and he drinks all Night:</L>
<L>His Wife and he alternate Watches keep;</L>
<L>At Morning when she wakes, he falls asleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FAR other Thoughts young <HI>Theron</HI>'s Bosom fire,</L>
<L>Far other Joys his noble Breast inspire:</L>
<L>No idle Pleasure charms the youthful Peer,</L>
<L>Except the Pleasure of a Charioteer:</L>
<L>Firm seated in the Box, he smoaks along,</L>
<L>The Jest and Wonder of the gazing Throng.</L>
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
<L>Dextrous as Racers on <HI>Olympian</HI> Plains,</L>
<L>He sounds the clashing Whip, and shakes the loosen'd Reins:</L>
<L>Proud to survey the Wheels impetuous roll,</L>
<L>While all the Coachman's Glory warms his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CHREMES, devoutly mad, forsakes his Wife,</L>
<L>His Friends and Children, for a future Life:</L>
<L>He follows <HI>Whitefield,</HI> by the Spirit driv'n;</L>
<L>And starves himself on Earth, to feast in Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To shun the fatal Rock on which he splits,</L>
<L><HI>Diagoras</HI> employs his subtle Wits;</L>
<L>Denies the Being of a God by Rule,</L>
<L>And proves by Logic—that he is a Fool.</L>
<L>Is there no Mean, no Passage we can find</L>
<L>Safely to steer this Vessel of the Mind?</L>
<L>Must we on <HI>Scylla</HI> or <HI>Charybdis</HI> run?</L>
<L>When Dead, be wretched; or alive, undone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
<L>GRACCHUS, endow'd with admirable Parts,</L>
<L>Polish'd with Learning, Eloquence, and Arts,</L>
<L>Protects the People warmly in Debate,</L>
<L>And all his Pleasure's to reform the State;</L>
<L>He could adjust all Business of the Crown,</L>
<L>And yet he never could adjust his own:</L>
<L>Not that he wanted Wit for such Affairs;</L>
<L>He had too much for low domestic Cares.</L>
<L>His active scheming Head has always found</L>
<L>Too little Business, which has turn'd it round:</L>
<L>As pond'rous Ships, immoderately great,</L>
<L>For want of proper Ballast, overset.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OTHERS there are, who use their utmost Skill</L>
<L>To climb Ambition's flatt'ring faithless Hill:</L>
<L>To Posts and Dignities To-day they rise;</L>
<L>To-morrow greater Honours tempt their Eyes:</L>
<L>For these they struggle; next; they these acquire;</L>
<L>Greater appear, and greater they desire:</L>
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
<L>Those too they gain: Well, now they have their Will,</L>
<L>Or is this happy <HI>Something</HI> farther still?</L>
<L>Alas! my <HI>Laelius,</HI> you mistake their Aim,</L>
<L>Their Pleasure's in the Chace, not in the Game.</L>
<L>As arrant Sportsmen hunt thro' Bog and Brake,</L>
<L>Not for their Hunger, but Diversion's sake.</L>
<L>See <HI>Manlius,</HI> striving for his Lordship's Place;</L>
<L>His Lordship very fain would be his Grace:</L>
<L>The Serjeant treads upon the Judge's Heels,</L>
<L>Th'impatient Judge anticipates the Seals.</L>
<L>Some, boldly vain, like <HI>Phaethon,</HI> aspire;</L>
<L>And, if indulg'd, would set the World on Fire.</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Budgel</HI> hop'd to guide the Reins of State:</L>
<L>My Lord of <HI>Lambeth's</HI> miserably great!</L>
<L>Oppress'd with Cares and Business all his Time,</L>
<L>And, harder still! he can no higher climb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Muse, my Friend, might Thousands more relate,</L>
<L>(Led either by their Folly, or their Fate)</L>
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
<L>Who follow Pleasures of another Sort:</L>
<L>Some go to <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and some to Court;</L>
<L>These rake in Stews, those shine in Drawing-rooms,</L>
<L>Proud of their Cloaths, as Peacocks of their Plumes;</L>
<L>Who in their Dress such wond'rous Pleasure take,</L>
<L>They wear their Happiness upon their Back.</L>
<L>In Dress the gay Lord <HI>Fopling</HI> squanders more</L>
<L>Than would support an Hospital of Poor.</L>
<L>For Dress in Debt <HI>Fastidius</HI> yearly runs,</L>
<L>Patient of Scandal, negligent of Duns:</L>
<L>While <HI>Curius,</HI> lewd and lavish on his Whores,</L>
<L>Brings Claps and Fashions from the <HI>Gallic</HI> Shores:</L>
<L>These have their Pleasures: Is it then a Crime</L>
<L>In me to take the Privilege of Rhyme?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT now, methinks you whisper in my Ear,</L>
<L>"This Itch of Rhyming carries you too far:"</L>
<L>What is't to me, you say, whose Plays are dull?</L>
<L>What is't to me, who's Fop, or Knave, or Fool?</L>
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<L>Who games, or swears, or lyes, or jobs, or cheats?</L>
<L>Who gain Preferments, or who lose Estates?</L>
<L>Men ever had their Pleasures, ever will:</L>
<L>In God's Name let them have their Pleasures still!</L>
<L>But since in diff'rent ways they all incline</L>
<L>To have their Pleasures, shall I not have mine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THERE's Mistress <HI>Drummond</HI> frequently will tell ye,</L>
<L>The Spirit swells her like to burst her Belly;</L>
<L>How shall she ease her Bosom of the Load?</L>
<L>How, but discharge and loose the lab'ring God?</L>
<L>Shall Ease, my Friend, be found for her alone?</L>
<L>Shall she have Remedy, and I have none?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WELL then, proceed, you say; but mark the End;</L>
<L>Writing will make you Foes, tho' not a Friend:</L>
<L>Besides, 'twere Vanity to think your Lays</L>
<L>Should please a Critic's Ear, or merit Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<L>PRAISE is a Feather, foreign to my Hope:</L>
<L>Give it to THOMSON, WARBURTON, or POPE.</L>
<L>When urgent Nature calls, I write for Ease,</L>
<L>The Call of Nature ev'ry one obeys.</L>
<L>Alike the Learn'd, and those who never learn,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis in a College, or a Barn;</L>
<L>Whether on <HI>Mincio</HI>'s Banks, or in the Mint:</L>
<L>When Nature bids us write, we write and print.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I KNOW your Judgment, Sense, and Taste require</L>
<L>A Bard to sing with Spirit, Force, and Fire;</L>
<L>Compose such Numbers as the Ancients writ.</L>
<L>Are Ancients then the only Men of Wit?</L>
<L>Is Wit immutable? Is nothing so,</L>
<L>But what was writ Two thousand Years ago?</L>
<L>Sure if it vary not, 'tis mighty strange,</L>
<L>Since much more sacred Things have suffer'd Change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BEFORE King <HI>Harry</HI> (last of all the Name)</L>
<L>To good Queen <HI>Bess</HI>'s Mother told his Flame,</L>
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<L>What a mysterious Dress Religion wore!</L>
<L>What Crops of Superstition <HI>England</HI> bore!</L>
<L>Our pious Sires implicit Faith receiv'd,</L>
<L>Believing what could hardly be believ'd.</L>
<L>'Twas Sin to think their Bread compos'd of Flour,</L>
<L>Or Two and Two equivalent to Four.</L>
<L>Nor dar'd they reason in their own Defence,</L>
<L>For the worst Heresy was common Sense:</L>
<L>Or if they durst espouse the noble Cause</L>
<L>Of Nature's Right, and Truth's eternal Laws,</L>
<L>Bulls and Damnations thunder'd from the Press,</L>
<L>And curs'd as zealously as Christ could bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, thank Reformers of a later Age,</L>
<L>We can't complain of superstitious Rage;</L>
<L>No <HI>Flamen</HI> cheats us with his holy Wiles,</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Smithfield</HI> smoaks with frequent Fun'ral Piles.</L>
<L>No Royal <HI>Quixotes</HI> lead their martial Pow'rs</L>
<L>To fight for Lady <HI>Faith</HI> on Foreign Shores:</L>
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
<L>Yet grant, Almighty Heav'n, we may not fall</L>
<L>From too much Piety, to none at all!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS Modes of Faith have chang'd, 'tis very plain;</L>
<L>And Wit has chang'd, and change it will again.</L>
<L>This comforts <HI>M—r;</HI> for we must allow,</L>
<L>Tho' his damn'd Comedies are Folly now,</L>
<L>They may be Wit, perhaps, to future Fools,</L>
<L>If they escape Trunks, Kitchens, and Close-stools.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'TWERE hard, indeed, if nothing should be writ,</L>
<L>But what was solid Sense, or current Wit;</L>
<L>Such rigid Laws would ruin Authors quite,</L>
<L>Not One in Twenty would attempt to write:</L>
<L>But, as the Poets Case in <HI>Britain</HI> stands,</L>
<L>We scorn tenacious Wit shou'd tie our Hands.</L>
<L>We freely write whatever we devise,</L>
<L>No matter whether Wit, or Truth, or Lyes.</L>
<L>Thus bold <HI>Lucilius</HI> lashes half the Town,</L>
<L>And teaches <HI>Manners,</HI> tho' himself has none;</L>
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
<L>At Peers and Prelates darts his poison'd Stings,</L>
<L>Asperses Ministers, and libels Kings;</L>
<L>Rakes up the sacred Ashes of a Queen</L>
<L>To vent his Spite, and gratify his Spleen.</L>
<L>Thus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Harlequin Horace,</HI> p. 7. where the Author prosesses he has imitated the Style of Mr. <HI>Pope.</HI></NOTE> He, who mimics POPE'S immortal Pen,</L>
<L>(Tho' awkwardly as Monkeys mimic Men)</L>
<L>With wicked Farce profanes the hallow'd Gown,</L>
<L>And to expose our Folly, shews his own.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>L</HI>—, when at Leisure from the Stews,</L>
<L>Thro' Dirt and Dung whips a lame, jaded Muse,</L>
<L>To number all would weary <HI>Whitefield's</HI> Lungs,</L>
<L>Who scribble Journals, and satiric Songs;</L>
<L>Who rail at WALPOLE, impotent and fierce,</L>
<L>Barren of Thought, yet prodigal of Verse.</L>
<L>Guilty of Scandal, innocent of Wit,</L>
<L>They write worse Stuff than <HI>Flecknoe</HI> ever writ:</L>
<L>And by the half-form'd Embryo's of the Scull,</L>
<L>Abuse the Privilege of being dull.</L>
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
<L>God save his Honour! while such Authors write,</L>
<L>He ought to thank their inoffensive Spite.</L>
<L>And shall not I indulge my harmless Pen?</L>
<L>And have my Way, as well as other Men?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU, worthy <HI>Laelius,</HI> have your Pleasure too,</L>
<L>And, quitting Crouds, a nobler Way pursue;</L>
<L>The Way of Truth and Virtue you explore,</L>
<L>For this you turn the <HI>Grecian</HI> Sages o'er:</L>
<L>For this You read what <HI>Roman</HI> Authors writ,</L>
<L>Digest their Precepts, and improve their Wit.</L>
<L>In these, and true Philosophy, you find</L>
<L>A Muse, to tune and harmonize your Mind,</L>
<L>Who sings, All Pleasure, rightly understood,</L>
<L>Consists alone in being Wise and Good.</L>
