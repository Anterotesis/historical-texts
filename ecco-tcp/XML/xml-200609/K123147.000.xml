<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Book here presented to the Public is compiled from
two of the most singular and illustrious philosophers that ever
flourished in this part of the world. It has been their fate,
with other great and good men in all ages, to incur the deepest
obloquy, even in the instant of conferring on mankind the
most lasting and extensive benefits. Their works, however,
will endure as long as the language, and their names be recorded
with honour, while the history of <HI>Britain</HI> continues to interest
posterity.</P>
<P>The private characters of <HI>Hume</HI> and <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> exhibit no∣thing
strikingly similar, except their attachment to study, and
eager pursuit of literary Fame. The manners of the one were
simple, plain, amiable, and engaging: those of the other, rather
stotely, often assuming, and uniformly refined. The youth, as
well as manhood, of the first, was spent, under every circum∣stance
in which fortune placed him, in a sedulous and single
attention to the cultivation and improvement of his literary
talents; that of the second, apparently without any view what∣ever,
and in scenes of the most exceptionable dissipation.</P>
<P><HI>Hume</HI> maintained through life an unsullied reputation for
every species of virtue and worth. In company or out of it,
abroad or at home, his good-nature never forsook him. His
temper was generally unruffled, even while the petulance of his
pious persecutors exposed him to the rudest insult: and he
has been known to revise, with exemplary candour, the foulest
libels, presented to him under the name of Answers to some
parts of his writings. The very poor in his neighbourhood,
though instigated by priestcraft to revile and execrate his opi∣nions,
<PB N="ii" REF="3"/>
regarded his benevolence and humanity with a mixture
of reverence and gratitude. His deportment on every occasion,
while eminently chaste and manly, was altogether the reverse
of pomp or ostentation. Peculiarly affable and easy of access,
he discovered nothing of the scholar, either in his appearance
or conversation; and all his attentions, being the spontaneous
effusions of genuine philanthropy, were without ceremony or
parade. While his talents were vigorously exerted to overturn
the system, his morals would have adorned the purest and most
primitive ages, of Christianity! And he was neither wanting
in that extraordinary strength of mind, nor in that singular
goodness of heart, which in every country and period of human
story have always distinguished the greatest and the best of men.</P>
<P>To this high degree of excellence in the first distinctions of
humanity, <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> had no claim. The sublimest theory of
virtue which his exalted genius could either conceive or recom∣mend,
had yet but little influence on the management of his
passions. He was not a speculative, only, but a practical, li∣bertine.
Stationed for a great number of years, and during
some of the most important periods of our history, in the giddy
vortex of public life, he was evidently too deeply engrossed and
agitated, to be much susceptible of those tender endearments
which for the most part prompt and accompany the exercise of
private and domestic virtue. But towards the evening of his
days, in a situation not a little solitary and romantic, his ele∣vated
and enlightened mind assumed a gravity and repose suit∣able
to that majestic and commanding tone which had ever cha∣racterised
its greatest exertions. It was then only one of his
fondest admirers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord</HI> Orrery.</NOTE> remarks of him, that he united in conversa∣tion
the wisdom of <HI>Socrates</HI> with the ardour of <HI>Plato,</HI> the dig∣nity
and ease of <HI>Pliny</HI> with the wit and sprightliness of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P>Different as the talents in writing of these eminent authors
certainly were, the many bright specimens of their taste and
<PB N="iii" REF="4"/>
genius, now in possession of the public, discover a few points,
at least, in which there is still a very striking likeness. The
infinite and irreparable mischief done to society by an affecta∣tion
of religion, where the reality of it was wanting, betrayed
each of them into a most implacable and unwarrantable aversion
to whatever bears the name: and under the obnoxious masque
of bigotry, the most sacred feelings and regards of mankind
are treated with due respect by neither. Still a rich and shining
variety of beautiful and interesting passages, in the vicinity of
many very exceptionable ones, in both, have for this reason
been long lost to those, especially, on whom they were likely
to produce the best effects. And the design of this little vo∣lume
is to extract from a huge collection of such gross materials
some of the purest ore, to enlist on the side of Virtue the
greatest advocates for Infidelity, and to despoil Vice of those
meretricious weapons by which she has done most execution.</P>
<P><HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s genius was bold, picturesque, splendid, and ora∣torical;
that of <HI>Hume</HI> seemed more acute, concise, and pene∣trating.
The one is distinguished by a lofty and daring imagi∣nation,
by an inexhaustible brilliancy of ideas, and by a diction
peculiarly expressive and tropical; the other, by a clear and sub∣til
understanding, by deep and accurate thinking, and by a style
uniformly easy, emphatical, and elegant. The conceptions of
the first were so strong and ardent, that he grasped at Truth by
a kind of intuitive violence, without stooping to any of those
slow and intermediate means by which she condescends to be∣come
accessible to more ordinary minds: the second possessed
all the powers of investigation in such perfection, as induced
him to spare no pains in the discovery of this important object
by the humble and dispassionate, but certain mode of reason∣ing.
History and metaphysics were the favourite and most
successful study of <HI>Hume: Bolingbroke's</HI> letters on the first are
among the most finished of his productions; but he never lost
himself so completely as when he plunged into the bottomless
abyss of the second.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>
Both of these two celebrated writers have investigated, in a
masterly manner, the multifarious science of politics. Their
ideas, however, in a great variety of the first and most impor∣tant
particulars, are essentially different. The reasonings of
<HI>Hume,</HI> on all those popular and constitutional questions which
have been lately so repeatedly and so tenaciously debated in the
<HI>British</HI> senate, like his History, may be considered as a most
ingenious and elegant apology for prerogative. His uncommon
talents are perpetually occupied, and not without success, in
relaxing the general attachments of mankind to the important
blessings of liberty, in reconciling them to every possible modi∣fication
of government, in suppressing their sentiments of inde∣pendence,
and in suggesting new arguments for submission and
obedience. The opinions of <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> are not only more open
and decided, but uniformly on the side of freedom and the
rights of the subject, as settled at the Revolution. On this
delicate and interesting subject his productions are to this day
without a parallel. Politics seem his own peculiar province, in
which, notwithstanding his numerous compeers, he still reigns
unrivalled. His <HI>Dissertation on Parties,</HI> and <HI>Idea of a Patriot King,</HI>
are more replete than any thing else in the language with a
series of observations and reasonings concerning the distinct
privileges of prince and people, equally pertinent, original, and
persuasive. No where the dupe of those chimerical illusions
and conjectures which confound the shallow, and amuse the
speculative, the general principles on which his particular con∣clusions
are built, have all a sold and permanent foundation in
fact, and the nature of things. His sole and exclusive aim is to
graft the theory of the <HI>British</HI> constitution on ancient usage,
and to reduce it to present practice.</P>
<P>This system, so lately and ably revived by his Grace the
Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> is an obvious improvement by our noble
author on that which chiefly produced the Revolution. As it
does honour to his genius, it could not have found a better ad∣vocate.
He evidently writes from the heart, and, whatever he
<PB N="v" REF="6"/>
says, affects his readers with a forcible emphasis and propriety.
His conceptions, always formed with judgment and taste, are
every where delivered with earnestness and energy. The digni∣fied
manner in which he reprobates all those selfish and accom∣modating
principles, or maxims, which keep most public men
in an infamous kind of equiposse between honour and interest,
peculiarly becomes him. It is the genuine, but indignant, lan∣guage
of virtue, spurn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the insidious approaches of vice under
the most qualified and deceitful appearances. In one word, he
treats the whole science of government as proceeding regularly,
only when actuated by the great master-springs of right and
wrong. This is the key-stone or first principle of all his
politics; and to this, not, like <HI>Hume,</HI> to the manners of the
age, and the depravity of human nature, he directed all his ar∣guments,
and made all his appeals.</P>
<P>In the following selection, an equal attention is paid to the
morals of <HI>Hume</HI> and the politics of <HI>Bolingbroke.</HI> We have enough
in all conscience of that sophistry and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inement in which the
last was so great a master. He, perhaps, without intending,
has made it the cant of the day to sneer avowedly at whatever
bears the semblance of principle in public life. The people of
<HI>England</HI> happily feel, and even begin at last to resent, the per∣nicious
consequences of this most profligate and temporizing
system. <HI>Bolingbroke</HI>'s notions, on all points of present political
altercation or enquiry, are literally theirs. The substance of
what he thought and wrote, on whatever is most valuable and
interesting in the <HI>British</HI> constitution, is here combined and ex∣hibited.
And, to say the least that can be said, it is surely one
of the most inestimable legacies that ever a statesman bequeathed
to his country.</P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
DAVID HUME, Esq.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is constituted by nature, and moulded by habit, so
mechanically, that every individual may be said to differ from
another as essentially in the biass of his mind, and the tempe∣rature
of his heart, as in the features of his face. Whatever
makes this distinction, is that fixed and governing principle by
which character is formed and estimated.</P>
<P>A passion for literature runs visibly through the whole of
<HI>Hume</HI>'s life, and gives a colouring to all his actions. Here all
his wishes terminated; and, to accomplish distinction in this
exclusive line, every other view or prospect of ambition was
sacrificed. Nor does he owe more of his success to uncommon
ability and address, perhaps, than to his steady, ardent, and
unremitted pursuit of one great and interesting concern. This,
at least, clearly accounts for all that attachment to paradox and
pyrrhonism which so singularly characterise his metaphysical
writings.</P>
<P>His parents were descended of a good family, and indepen∣dent,
though not wealthy. He was born at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the
26th of <HI>April,</HI> 1711, old style. His patrimony was but trifling,
as he was only a younger brother.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
That predilection for study, which never forsook him, dis∣covered
itself at an early period. This, with his habits of in∣dustry
and application, disposed his friends to six on the law as
a proper profession for him. But he owns, while they thought
him poring on <HI>Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> and <HI>Vinnius,</HI> he was secretly devouring
<HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>Impelled, however, by the narrowness of his fortune, he
thought of seriously attaching himself to business. For this
purpose he went to <HI>Bristol;</HI> but, preferring retirement and
books to every other pursuit and prospect, he soon left <HI>Bristol,</HI>
and repaired to <HI>France,</HI> where he could live at less expence, and
prosecute his literary views with equal advantage.</P>
<P>Partly at <HI>Rheims,</HI> but chiefly at <HI>La Flêche,</HI> in <HI>Anjou,</HI> he com∣posed
his <HI>Treatise of Human Nature.</HI> There he resided near
three years; and published this work shortly after his return to
<HI>England.</HI> But, to use his own phrase, it <HI>fell dead-born from the
press.</HI></P>
<P>He was more fortunate in the first part of his <HI>Essays,</HI> which
appeared originally at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in 1742. It is remarkable
that about this time, though somewhat turned of thirty, he
recovered his knowledge of the <HI>Greek</HI> language, which he had
almost lost through negligence.</P>
<P>He went, in 1745, to live with the Marquis of <HI>Annandale,</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> on special invitation; and, having undertook the
tuition of that nobleman's son, he continued in this situation
for a twelvemonth.</P>
<P>As secretary to General <HI>St. Clair,</HI> he attended in an expedi∣tion
on the coast of <HI>France,</HI> and afterwards accompanied him in
his embassy to the courts of <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Turin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
The two years in which he was thus employed; were almost
the only interruption his general studies ever received. It was
now he republished his first performance under a new form;
but it succeeded little better than before.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this disappointment, his fertile mind still
teemed with fresh literary adventures. The scenes he had
lately reviewed in his official capacity, probably opened to him
a variety of original speculations; and some of his former pub∣lications
gaining on the public estimation; he was encouraged,
in 1752, to bring forth his <HI>Political Discourses,</HI> which had a
most rapid sale.</P>
<P>Soon after appeared his <HI>Enquiry concerning the Principles of
Morals;</HI> which, in his own opinion, is, of all his writings,
incomparably the best.</P>
<P>His next performance was the <HI>History of England,</HI> which he
commenced with the accession of the House of <HI>Stuart</HI> to the
sovereignty of <HI>Britain.</HI> This work cost him great pains, and
gave him much hope. It was received, however, so coolly,
that he scarcely heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con∣siderable
for rank or letters, that could endure it. The two
Primates of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> were, indeed, exceptions odd
enough; who sent him separate messages, not to be discou∣raged.
But it was then, perhaps, as now, when court-creepers,
or sticklers for prerogative, are the most likely to succeed in the
line of ecclesiastical preferment. This disappointment had al∣most
got the better of his resolution; and a war, which at that
time subsisted between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> was the only thing
that kept him from going into voluntary banishment. To this
accidental circumstance we owe his completion of the most
finished and classical History this or any other country ever
produced.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10"/>
<HI>The Natural History of Religion</HI> was now published. This
gave a serious alarm to the religious sentiments of his country∣men.
Many indirect attacks were made on it; and it brought
on the author all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurri∣lity,
of the <HI>Warburtonian</HI> school.</P>
<P>Two years subsequent to the fall of the first, came out the
second volume of his History, which brought it down from the
death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. to the Revolution. This made him some
amends for his other literary miscarriages: it was a popular
performance, and not only raised the character of the author,
but rendered the former volume of some request.</P>
<P>His account of the House of <HI>Tudor</HI> was not published till
1759, and was then regarded with dislike, especially in <HI>England.</HI>
This, however, did not deter him from finishing, in two vo∣lumes,
the more early periods of the <HI>British</HI> story, which he
gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable,
success.</P>
<P>He was then invited to attend the Earl of <HI>Hertford,</HI> on his
embassy to <HI>Paris;</HI> which, after some hesitation and reluctance,
he thought proper to accept. He speaks with much satisfaction
of the pleasure he received from the connexions to which this
appointment introduced him.</P>
<P>The present Commander in Chief being appointed one of
his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, in 1767, our author
was made Under-Secretary. In this department he continued
for near two years, and went out with the then Ministry.</P>
<P>He now possessed a thousand pounds of yearly revenue, and
returned to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> with the fond hopes of long enjoying,
at his leisure, and among his friends, the honourable rewards
of his great talents and great industry.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
In about half a dozen years he was seized, however, with
a disorder in his bowels, which at first gave him no alarm, but
which soon became incurable. He did not die till several
months after having given up all hopes of life. He suffered
but little pain, and retained his faculties and spirits to the
very last.</P>
<P>He pronounces his own oulogium in a manner that shews
how well he deserved it. We insert it in this place as none of
the least beautiful passages in his works.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was a man of mild disposition, of command of temper,
of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attach∣ment,
but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation
in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling
passion, never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent
disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the
young and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>areless, as well as to the studious and literary; and
as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest wo∣men,
I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met
with from them. In a word, though most men any wise emi∣nent,
have found reason to complain of Calumny, I never was
touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth; and though I
wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious
factions, they seemed to be disarmed, in my behalf, of their
wanted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any
one circumstance of my character and conduct: not but that
the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to in∣vent
and propagate any story to my disadvantage; but they
could never find any which they thought would wear the face of
probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this
funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one;
and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascer∣tained."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12"/>
The same experimental mode of philosophizing which the
great <HI>Bacon</HI> recommends, and which had been so successfully
applied by <HI>Locke</HI> to metaphysics, and by <HI>Newton</HI> to physical phae∣nomena,
our author uniformly adopts in all his disquisitions on
morals and human nature. It is in this systematic and rational
use of facts his chief excellence as an author and philosopher
lies. Perhaps it may be said of him, what <HI>Pope</HI> said of <HI>Boling∣broke,
If ever he trifies, it may be when he turns Divine.</HI></P>
<P>Many have lamented much, that ever his great abilities pro∣duced
any thing inimical to Christianity. It afforded, however,
one very important example of decency and command of temper
to all her friends and apologists. For whatever obligations she
may have to many of their labours, she has none to some dis∣positions
discovered in her behalf.</P>
<P>Our author began his literary career with a resolution, which
he inflexibly maintained through life, never to reply to any
body: and not being very irascible in his temper, he easily
kept clear of all literary squabbles. The unmanly sarcasms
even of a <HI>Beattie,</HI> the most illiberal and virulent of all his anta∣gonists,
never extorted from him a single invective. He regarded
his furious declamation only as so much froth, which he well
knew would subside, and be forgotten, the moment the vapour
that produced it vanished.</P>
<P>About this time, a quarto edition of his <HI>Essays</HI> was pub∣lished,
in two volumes; to one of which the following Adver∣tisement
was prefixed: <Q REND="inline">"Most of the principles and reasonings
contained in this volume, were published in a work, in three
volumes, intitled, <HI>A Treatise of Human Nature;</HI> a work which
the author had projected before he left college, and which he
wrote and published not long after: but not finding it suc∣cessful,
he was sensible of his error in going to the press too
early, and he cast the whole a-new in the following pieces;
where some negligences in his former reasoning, and more in
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>
the expression, are, he hopes, corrected. Yet several writers,
who have honoured the author's philosophy with answers,
have taken care to direct all their batteries against that juve∣nile
work, which the author never acknowledged; and have
affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined
they had obtained over it: a practice very contrary to all rules
of candour and fair dealing, and a strong instance of those
polemical artifices which a bigoted zeal thinks itself autho∣rised
to employ."</Q></P>
<P>This Life we shall conclude with a Note, occasioned by a
Reply to his Essay on the <HI>Populousness of ancient Nations.</HI> This
Reply was written by a late eminent Divine, of the church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> who discovered on this, as on all other occasions, such
a manly attention to truth, as precluded the impertinent inter∣ference
of every other passion. Our author takes notice of this
respectful answer in a manner equally honourable to both. The
Note is preserved in none of the later editions of his works.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"AN ingenious writer has honoured this discourse with an
answer, full of politeness, erudition, and good-sense. So learned
a refutation would have made the author suspect that his reason∣ings
were entirely overthrown, had he not used the precaution,
from the beginning, to keep himself on the sceptical side; and,
having taken this advantage of the ground, he was enabled,
though with much inferior forces, to preserve himself from a
total defeat. That Reverend Gentleman will always find, where
his antagonist is so entrenched, that it will be difficult to force
him. <HI>Varro,</HI> in such a situation, could defend himself against
<HI>Hannibal, Pharnaces</HI> against <HI>Caesar.</HI> The author very willingly
acknowledges that his antagonist has detected many mistakes in
his authorities and reasonings; and it was owing entirely to that
Gentleman's indulgence, that many more errors were not re∣marked.
In this edition, advantage has been taken of his
learned animadversions, and the Essay has been rendered less
imperfect than formerly."</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
HENRY ST. JOHN,
LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HENRY ST. JOHN,</HI> Lord Viscount <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> was born
in the year 1672, at <HI>Battersea,</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> at a seat that had
been in the possession of his ancestors for ages before. His fa∣mily
was of the first rank, equally conspicuous for its antiquity,
dignity, and large possessions. It is found to trace its original
as high as <HI>Adam de Port,</HI> Baron of <HI>Basing,</HI> in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> before
the Conquest; and, in a succession of ages, to have produced
warrio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, patriots, and statesmen; some of whom were conspi∣cuous
for their loyalty, and others for their defending the rights
of the people. His grandfather, Sir <HI>Walter St. John,</HI> of <HI>Bat∣tersea.</HI>
marrying one of the daughters of Lord Chief Justice
<HI>St. John,</HI> who, as all know, was strongly attached to the Re∣publican
party, <HI>Henry,</HI> the subject of the present memoir, was
brought up in his family, and consequently imbibed the first
principles of his education amongst the Dissenters.</P>
<P>Nature seemed not less kind to him in her external embel∣lishments,
than in adorning his mind. With the graces of an
handsome person, and a face in which dignity was happily
blended with sweetness, he had a manner of address that was
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
very engaging. His vivacity was always awake, his apprehen∣sion
was quick, his wit refined, and his memory amazing:
his subtilty in thinking and reasoning was profound; and all
these talents were adorned with an elocution that was irresistible.</P>
<P>To the assemblage of so many gifts from Nature, it was ex∣pected
that Art would soon give her finishing hand; and that
a youth begun in excellence, would soon arrive at perfection:
but such is the perverseness of human nature, that an age
which should have been employed in the acquisition of know∣ledge,
was dissipated in pleasure; and, instead of aiming to ex∣cel
in praise-worthy pursuits, <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> seemed more ambitious
of being thought the greatest rake about town.</P>
<P>In this mad career of pleasure he continued for some time;
but at length, in 1700, when he arrived at the twenty-eighth
year of his age, he began to take a dislike to his method of
living, and to find that sensual pleasure alone was not sufficient
to make the happiness of a reasonable creature. He therefore
made his first effort to break from his state of infatuation, by
marrying the daughter and coheiress of Sir <HI>Henry Winchescomb,</HI>
a descendant from the famous <HI>Jack</HI> of <HI>Newbury,</HI> who, though
but a clothier, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. was able to enter∣tain
the King, and all his retinue, in the most splendid manner.
This Lady was possessed of a fortune exceeding forty thousand
pounds, and was not deficient in mental accomplishments; but
whether he was not yet fully satiated with his former pleasures,
or whether her temper was not conformable to his own, it is
certain they were far from living happily together. After co∣habiting
for some time together, they parted by mutual con∣sent,
both equally displeased; he complaining of the obstinacy
of her temper, she of the shamelessness of his infidelity. A
great part of her fortune, some time after, upon his attainder,
was given her back; but as her family estates were settled upon
him, he enjoyed them after her death, upon the reversal of his
attainder.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
It is impossible to do justice to the public life of this great
man, without giving a particular detail of politics for a great
number of years. His eloquence, abilities, and influence, soon
brought him forward in the service of his country. The latter
end of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s reign seems the period in which, of all
others, his capacity as a statesman and minister shone with the
greatest lustre. That critical juncture called for the exertion of
all his eminent qualities; and it is agreed, that he managed the
contending factions which then divided the nation, a most ex∣pensive
continental war, an intriguing court, and a fickle Queen,
with an address and success equally exquisite and unexpected.</P>
<P>While thus industriously employed, he was not without the
rewards that deserved to follow such abilities, joined to so much
assiduity. In <HI>July</HI> 1712, he was created Baron <HI>St. John,</HI> of
<HI>Lidyard Tregoze,</HI> in <HI>Wittshire,</HI> and Viscount <HI>Bolingbroke;</HI> by the
last of which titles he is now generally known, and is likely to
be talked of by posterity. He was also the same year appointed
Lord-Lieutenant of the county of <HI>Essex.</HI> By the titles of <HI>Tre∣goze</HI>
and <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> he united the honours of the elder and
younger branch of his family; and thus transmitted into one
channel, the opposing interests of two races, that had been di∣stinguished,
one for their loyalty to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the other
for their attachment to the Parliament that opposed him. It
was afterwards his boast, that he steered clear of the extremes
for which his ancestors had been distinguished, having kept the
spirit of freedom of the one, and acknowledged the subordina∣tion
that distinguished the other.</P>
<P>His quarrel with <HI>Oxford,</HI> whom he despised, exposed both to
the most imminent destruction. So noble a mind was above
harbouring groundless resentments, but no concessions could re∣concile
him to the base or worthless.</P>
<P>On the accession of <HI>George</HI> the First, he shared the ruin of
his party; and, as one of their leaders, accumulated most of
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
the odium their measures had incurred. The revenge of his
enemies, who had now wriggled themselves into power, made
it unsafe for him to stay longer in <HI>England.</HI> Immediately on
his departure for <HI>France,</HI> a bill of attainder was preferred against
him.</P>
<P>It was now, partly from resentment and disgust, and partly
from a strong predilection for the bustle of office, but chiefly to
gratify his boundless ambition, that he joined the Pretender.
But in this new service he found every thing so very mean and
mortifying, that he never appeared hearty in the business. Nor
was he treated with that confidence and cordiality, to which he
thought the sacrifices he made, and his conscious ability, justly
intitled him. It was his aim always to be foremost in every
administration, and he could not bear to act as a subaltern in so
paltry a court as that of the Pretender. Within less than a
twelvemonth he was therefore dismissed, and even served with
a mock impeachment, by his new master.</P>
<P>This fortunate accident awakened all his sensibility, and
made him long, more than ever, for a participation of those
liberties, the malice of his persecutors had tempted him to forfeit.
To the intrigues of the court, perhaps, more than to the inter∣ference
of friends, or any other cause, he owed the accomplish∣ment
of this desirable event. During this interval, notwith∣standing
the painful suspense in which we must suppose him, he
wrote <HI>Reflections on Exile,</HI> one of the most masterly, the most
elegant, and the most affecting moral compositions in our lan∣guage.</P>
<P>His first Lady, with whom he had not cohabited for years,
being now dead, he married a second time, and, on his return
to <HI>England,</HI> devoted his time entirely to a country life, the
charms of philosophy, and domestic happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
Obscurity, however, was not his element. While his friends
thought him reconciled to his fate, he secretly sighed to emerge
a-new in a public capacity. But the minister of the day
dreaded his abilities and virtues. He petitioned the House of
Commons to be reinstated in his former emoluments and capa∣cities:
but the cabals of the cabinet defeated his wishes. This
instigated him to take part with <HI>Pultney,</HI> in his opposition to
<HI>Walpole.</HI> The last engaged to manage the House of Commons,
and the first to open the eyes of the people.</P>
<P>This great political controversy lasted ten years; in the course
of which, our noble author elucidated all the beauties and ex∣cellencies
of the <HI>British</HI> constitution with singular elegance and
perspicuity. His system of politics is certainly the most com∣plete
and satisfactory of any in the language. Happily for this
country, it is now popular and predominant. And in our ex∣cerpts
from his writings, respect has been chiefly had to those
leading ideas of ministers, government, and the constitution,
which coincide most with the general sentiments of the nation
on these subjects.</P>
<P>Disgusted with all parties, and apparently tired of every pur∣suit,
he once more took leave of <HI>England,</HI> and retired to <HI>France.</HI>
But even in solitude his hours did not glide away in torpid in∣activity.
Having no further chance of ruling his cotemporaries,
he revolved on securing the applaute and gratitude of posterity.
This laudable object he pursued, with dignity and success, in a
course of <HI>Letters on the Study of History;</HI> which exhibit the deli∣ca,
of his taste, the energy of his mind, and the sensibility of
his heart, in the most amiable and useful point of view.</P>
<P>It was here too, that, in a Letter addressed to Lord <HI>Bathurst,</HI>
he apologizes for his attachment to retirement and study. This
Letter, like all his political writings, discovers much political
discernment, and has, what is wanting in most of them, great
moderation, and some fine morality.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
Yet still, amidst his resolutions to turn himself from politics,
and to give himself up entirely to the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of philosophy, he
could not resist embarking once more in the debates of his
country; and, coming back from <HI>France,</HI> settled as <HI>Battersea,</HI>
an old seat which was his father's, and had been long in the
possession of the family. He supposed he saw an impending
calamity; and, thought it was not in his power to remove, he
thought it his duty to retard its fall. To redeem or save the
nation from perdition, he thought impossible; since national
corruptions were to be purged by national calamities: but he
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olved to send his feeble assistance, to item the torrent that
was pouring in. With this spirit he wrote that excellent piece;
which is intit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, <HI>The Idea of a Patriot King:</HI> in which he de∣scribes
a Monarch uninfluenced by party, leaning to the sug∣gestions
neither of Whigs no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tories, but equally the friend
and father of all Some time after, in the year 1749, after
the conclusion of the peace, two years before the measures
taken by the administration seemed not to have been repugnant
to his notions of political prudence for that juncture; in that
year he wrote his last production, containing Reflections on the
then State of the Nation, principally with regard to her Taxes
and Debts, and on the Causes and Consequences of them. This
undertaking was left unfinished; for Death snatched the pen
from the hand of the writer.</P>
<P>Having passed the latter part of his life in dignity and splen∣dour,
his rational faculties improved by reflection, and his am∣bition
kept under by disappointment, his whole aim seemed to
have been to leave the stage of life, on which he had acted such
various parts, with applause. He had long withed to fetch his
last breath at <HI>Battersea,</HI> the place whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he was born; and For∣tune,
that had through life seemed to traverse all his aims, at
last indulged him in this. He had long been troubled with a
cancer in his cheek; by which excruciating disease he died, on
the verge of fourscore years of age. He was consonant with
himself to the last; and those principles which he had all along
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
avowed, he confirmed with his dying breath; having given
orders that none of the clergy should be permitted to trouble
him in his latest moments.</P>
<P>In this manner lived and died Lord <HI>Bolingbroke;</HI> ever active,
never depressed; ever pursuing Fortune, and as constantly dis∣appointed
by her. In whatever light we view his character,
we shall find him an object rather proper for our wonder, than
our imitation; more to be feared than esteemed, and gaining
our admiration without our love. His ambition ever aimed at
the summit of power; and nothing seemed capable of satisfying
his immoderate desires, but the liberty of governing all things
without a rival. With as much ambition, as great abilities, and
more acquired knowledge than <HI>Caesar,</HI> he wanted only his cou∣rage
to be as successful; but the schemes his head dictated, his
heart often refused to execute; and he lost the ability to per∣form,
just when the great occasion called for all his efforts to
engage.</P>
<P>The same ambition that prompted him to be a politician,
actuated him as a philosopher. His aims were equally great
and extensive in both capacities. Unwilling to submit to any
power in the one, or any authority in the other, he entered the
fields of science with a thorough contempt of all that had been
established before him; and seemed to think every thing wrong,
that he might shew his faculty in the reformation. It might
have been better for his quiet, as a man, if he had been con∣tent
to act a subordinate character in the state; and it had cer∣tainly
been better for his memory as a writer, if he had aimed
at doing less than he attempted. Wisdom in morals, like every
other art or science, is an accumulation that numbers have con∣tributed
to increase; and it is not for one single man to pretend,
that he can add more to the heap than the thousands that have
gone before him. Such innovators more frequently retard than
promote knowledge; their maxims are more agreeable to the
reader, by having the gloss of novelty to recommend them,
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
than those which are trite, only because they are true. Such
men are therefore followed, at first, with avidity; nor is it till
some time that their disciples begin to find their error. They
often, though too late, perceive, that they have been following
a speculative enquiry, while they have been leaving a practical
good; and, while they have been practising the arts of doubting,
they have been losing all firmness of principle, which might
tend to establish the rectitude of their private conduct. As a
moralist, therefore, Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> by having endeavoured at
too much, seems to have done nothing; but as a political
writer, few can equal, and none can exceed him. As he was a
practical posicician, his writings are less filled with those specu∣lative
illusions, which are the result of solitude and seclusion.
He wrote them with a certainty of their being opposed, sifted,
examined, and reviled; he therefore took care to build them
up of such materials as could not be easily overthrown: they
prevailed at the times in which they were written; they still
continue to be the admiration of the present age, and will pro∣bably
last for ever.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>THE GOLDEN AGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE seasons, in this first period of nature,
were so temperate, that there was no necessity
for men to provide themselves with clothes and
houses, as a security against the violence of heat
and cold. The rivers flowed with wine and milk.
The oaks yielded honey; and nature spontane∣ously
produced her greatest delicacies. Nor were
these the chief advantages of that happy age.
Tempests were not alone removed from nature;
but those more furious tempests were unknown to
human breasts, which now cause such uproar, and
engender such confusion. Avarice, ambition, cru∣elty,
selfishness, were never heard of: cordial af∣fection,
compassion, sympathy, were the only
movements with which the mind was yet ac∣quainted.
Even the punctilious distinction of <HI>mine</HI>
and <HI>thine</HI> was banished from among that happy
race of mortals, and carried with it the very no∣tion
<PB N="2" REF="33"/>
of property and obligation, justice and in∣justice.</P>
<P>Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the
human race such profuse abundance of all external
conveniences, that without any uncertainty in the
event, without any care or industry on our part,
every individual finds himself fully provided with
whatever his most voracious appetites can want,
or luxurious imagination wish or desire. His na∣tural
beauty, we shall suppose, surpasses all acquired
ornaments. The perpetual clemency of the season
renders useless all clothes or covering. The raw
herbage affords him the most delicious fare; the
clear fountain, the richest beverage. No laborious
occupation required; no tillage; no navigation.
Music, poetry, and contemplation, form his sole
business; conversation, mirth, and friendship, his
sole amusement.</P>
<P>Thus the Hours pass unperceived along, and
lead in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense,
and all the joys of harmony and friendship Smi∣ling
<HI>Innocence</HI> closes the procession; and, while she
presents herself to our ravished eyes, she embel∣lishes
the whole scene, and renders the view of
these pleasures as transporting after they have
passed us, as when, with languishing counte∣nances,
they were yet advancing towards us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="3" REF="34"/>
<HEAD>HUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>When <HI>Pericles,</HI> the great <HI>Athenian</HI> statesman and
general, was on his death-bed, his surrounding
friends, deeming him now insensible, began to in∣dulge
their sorrow for their expiring patron, by
enumerating his great qualities and successes, his
conquests and victories, the unusual length of his
administration, and his nine trophies erected over
the enemies of the republic. 'You forget,' cries
the dying hero, who had heard all, 'you forget
the most eminent of my praises, while you dwell
so much on those vulgar advantages in which
fortune had the principal share. You have not
observed, that no citizen has ever yet worn
mourning on my account.'</P>
<P>While the human heart is compounded of the
same elements as at present, it will never be whol∣ly
indifferent to the public good, nor entirely
unaffected with the tendency of characters and
manners: and, though this affection of humanity
may not generally be esteemed so strong as vanity
or ambition, yet, being common to all men, it
can alone be the foundation of morals, or of any
general system of blame or praise. One man's
ambition is not another's ambition; nor will the
same event or object satisfy both: but the huma∣nity
of one man is the humanity of every one;
and the same object touches this passion in all hu∣man
creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="35"/>
Does the sage preserve himself always in this
philosophic indifference, and rest contented with
lamenting the miseries of mankind, without ever
employing himself for their relief? Does he con∣stantly
indulge this severe wisdom, which, by pre∣tending
to elevate him above human accidents,
does in reality harden his heart, and render him
careless of the interest of mankind, and of society?
No; he knows that in this sullen apathy neither
true wisdom, nor true happiness, is to be found.
He feels too strongly the charm of the social affec∣tions,
ever to counteract so sweet, so natural, so
virtuous a propensity. Even when bathed in tears,
he laments the miseries of the human race, of his
country, of his friends; and, unable to give suc∣cour,
can only relieve them by compassion; he yet
rejoices in the generous disposition, and feels a
satisfaction superior to that of the most indulged
sense. So engaging are the sentiments of huma∣nity,
that they brighten up the very face of sor∣row,
and operate like the sun, which, shining on
a dusky cloud or falling rain, paints on them the
most glorious colours that are to be found in the
whole circle of nature!</P>
<P>Knowledge in the arts of government naturally
begets mildness and moderation, by instructing
men in the advantages of humane maxims, above
rigour and severity, which drive subjects into re∣bellion,
and make the return to submission im∣practicable,
by cutting off all hopes of pardon
<PB N="5" REF="36"/>
When the tempers of men are softened, as well as
their knowledge improved, this humanity appears
still more conspicuous, and is the chief charac∣teristic
which distinguishes a civilized age from
times of barbarity and ignorance. Factions are
then less inveterate, revolutions less tragical, au∣thority
less severe, and seditions less frequent.
Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty; and,
after the field of battle, where honour and interest
steel men against compassion as well as fear, the
combatants divest themselves of the brute, and re∣sume
the man.</P>
<P>What charms are there in the harmony of minds,
and in a friendship founded on mutual esteem and
gratitude! What satisfaction in relieving the
distressed, in comforting the afflicted, in raising
the fallen, and in stopping the career of cruel
fortune, or of more cruel man, in their insults
over the good and virtuous!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>THE VOLUPTUARY.</HEAD>
<P>I examine the voluptuous man before enjoy∣ment;
I measure the vehemence of his desire, and
the importance of his object; I find that all his
happiness proceeds only from that hurry of thought
which takes him from himself, and turns his views
from his guilt and misery. I consider him a mo∣ment
after:—he has now enjoyed the pleasure
which he fondly sought after. The sense of his
guilt and misery returns upon him with double
<PB N="6" REF="37"/>
anguish: his mind tormented with fear and re∣morse;
his body depressed with disgust and satiety.</P>
<P>The joys of love, however furious and tumul∣tuous,
banish not the tender sentiments of sympa∣thy
and affection: they even derive their chief in∣fluence
from that generous passion; and, when pre∣sented
alone, afford nothing to the unhappy mind,
but lassitude and disgust. Behold the sprightly de∣bauchee,
who professes a contempt of all other plea∣sures
but those of wine and jollity: separate him
from his companions, like a spark from a fire,
where before it contributed to the general blaze;
his alacrity suddenly extinguishes; and though sur∣rounded
with every other means of delight, he
loaths the sumptuous banquet, and prefers even the∣most
abstract study and speculation, as more agree∣able
and entertaining.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>INHUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>The inhuman sports exhibited at <HI>Rome,</HI> may justly
be considered as an effect of the people's contempt
for slaves, and was also a great cause of the general
inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can
read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertain∣ments
without horror? or who is surprised that the
emperors should treat that people in the same way
the people treated their inferiors? One's humanity
on that occasion is apt to renew the barbarous wish
of <HI>Caligula,</HI> that the people had but one neck:
<PB REF="38"/>
a man could almost be pleased, by a single blow, to
put an end to such a race of monsters!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE is a restless and impatient passion, full of
caprices and variations; arising in a moment from a
feature, from an air, from nothing; and suddenly
extinguishing after the same manner. Such a pas∣sion
requires liberty above all things; and therefore
<HI>Eloisa</HI> had reason when, in order to preserve this
passion, she refused to marry her beloved <HI>Abelard.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,</L>
<L>Curse on all laws, but those which Love has made!</L>
<L>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,</L>
<L>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MORTALITY.</HEAD>
<P>CONSIDER, that if life be frail, if youth be tran∣sitory,
we should well employ the present moment,
and lose no part of so perishing an existence. Yet
a little moment, and these shall be no more; we
shall be as though we had never been: not a me∣mory
of us be left upon earth; and even fabulous
shades will not afford us an habitation Our fruit∣less
anxieties, our vain projects, our uncertain spe∣culation,
shall all be swallowed up and lost. Our
present doubts concerning the original cause of all
things must never, alas! be resolved. This alone we
may be certain of, that, if any governing mind pre∣side
over the universe, he must be pleased to see us
<PB N="8" REF="39"/>
fulfil the ends of our being, and enjoy that plea∣sure,
for which alone we were created.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>MOST men of generous tempers are apt to envy
the great, when they consider the large opportuni∣ties
such persons have of doing good to their fel∣low
creatures, and of acquiring the friendship and
esteem of men of merit. They make no advances
in vain, and are not obliged to associate with those
whom they have little kindness for; like people of
inferiour stations, who are subject to have their prof∣fers
of friendship rejected, even where they would be
most fond of placing their affections. But, though the
great have more facility in acquiring friendships,
they cannot be so certain of the sincerity of
them as men of a lower rank; since the favours they
bestow may acquire them flattery, instead of good∣will
and kindness. We attach ourselves more by
the services we perform, than by those we receive;
and a man is in danger of losing his friends, by obli∣ging
them too far. I should therefore chuse to lie in
the middle way, and to have my commerce with my
friend varied both by obligations given and recei∣ved.
I have too much pride, to be willing that all
the obligations should be on my side; and should be
afraid, that if they all lay on his, he would also have
too much pride to be entirely easy under them, or
have perfect complacency in my company.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="40"/>
Friendship is a calm and sedate affection, con∣ducted
by reason, and cemented by habit springing
from long acquaintance and mutual obligations;
without jealousies or fears, and without those fe∣verish
fits of heat and cold which cause such an
agreeable torment in the amorous passions. So sober
an affection therefore as friendship, rather thrives
under restraint, and never rises to such an height,
as when any strong interest or necessity binds two
persons together, and gives them some common ob∣ject
of pursuit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MEDIOCRITY OF FORTUNE.</HEAD>
<P>THE middle station of life is most favourable to
the acquiring of wisdom and ability, as well as of vir∣tue;
and a man so situate has a better chance of at∣taining
a knowledge both of men and things, than
those of a more elevated station. He enters with
more familiarity into human life; every thing appears
in its natural colours before him; he has more leisure
to form observations, and has besides the motive of
ambition to push him on in his attainments, being
certain that he can never rises to any distinction or
eminence in the world without his own industry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>LET us consider whether love or friendship
should most predominate in marriage; and we shall
soon determine whether liberty or constraint be
the most favourable to it. The happiest mar∣riages,
to be sure, are found where love, by long
<PB N="10" REF="41"/>
acquaintance, is consolidated into friendship.
Whoever dreams of raptures and extasies beyond the
honey-moon, is a fool. Even romances themselves,
with all their liberty of fiction, are obliged to drop
their lovers the very day of their marriage; and find
it easier to support the passion for a dozen years
under coldness, disdain, and difficulties, than a
week under possession and security. We need not
therefore be afraid of drawing the marriage knot
the closest possible. The friendship betwixt the
persons where it is solid and sincere, will rather
gain by it; and where it is wavering and uncertain,
this is the best expedient of fixing it. How many
frivolous quarrels and disgusts are there, which peo∣ple
of common prudence endeavour to forget, when
they lie under the necessity of passing their lives to∣gether;
but which would soon enflame into the most
deadly hatred, were they pursued to the utmost un∣der
the prospect of an easy separation!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>JEALOUSY.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>SPANIARD</HI> is jealous of the very thoughts
of those who approach his wife; and, if possible,
will prevent his being dishonoured even by the
wantonness of imagination. When the mother of
the late King of <HI>Spain</HI> was on her road to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
she passed through a little town in <HI>Spain,</HI> famous
for its manufactory of gloves and stockings. The
honest magistrates of the place thought they could
not better express their joy for the reception of their
<PB N="11" REF="42"/>
new Queen, than by presenting her with a sample
of those commodities, for which alone their town
was remarkable. The Major-Domo, who conducted
the Queen, received the gloves very graciously;
but when the stockings were presented, he flung
them away with great indignation, and severely
reprimanded the magistrates for this egregious piece
of indecency: "Know," says he, "that a Queen
of <HI>Spain</HI> has no legs." The poor young Queen, who
at that time understood the language but very im∣perfectly,
and had been often frightened with stories
of <HI>Spanish</HI> jealousy, imagined they were to cut off
her legs: upon which she sell a-crying, and begged
them to conduct her back to <HI>Germany;</HI> for that
she never could endure that operation: and it was
with some difficulty they could appease her. <HI>Phi∣lip</HI>
IV. is said never in his life to have laughed
heartily but at the recital of this story.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DIVORCE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW often does disgust and aversion rise, after
marriage, from the most trivial accidents, or from
an incompatibility of humour; where time, in∣stead
of curing the wounds proceeding from mu∣tual
injuries, does every day fester them the more,
by new quarrels and reproaches! Let us separate
hearts which are not made for each other. Each
of them may perhaps find another, for which it is
better fitted: at least, nothing can be more cruel
than to preserve by violence, an union, which at
first was made by mutual love, and is now in ef∣fect
dissolved by mutual hatred.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="43"/>
The liberty of divorce is not only a cure to ha∣tred
and domestic quarrels; it is also an admirable
preservative against them, and the only secret for
keeping alive that love which first united the mar∣ried
couple. The heart of man delights in liberty;
the very image of constraint is grievous to it:
when you would confine it by violence to what
would otherwise have been its choice, its inclina∣tion
immediately changes, and desire is turned into
aversion. If the public interest will not allow us
to enjoy, in polygamy, that variety which is so
agreeable in love, deprive us not, at least, of that
liberty which is so essentially requisite. In vain
you tell me, that I had my choice of the person
with whom I would conjoin myself: I had my
choice, it is true, of my prison; but this is only
a small comfort, since it must still be a prison.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>See, propitious to my wishes, the divine, the
amiable Pleasure, the supreme love of God and
men, advances towards me. At her approach, my
heart beats with genial heat, and every sense and
every faculty is dissolved in joy; while she pours
around me, all the embellishments of the Spring,
and all the treasures of the Autumn. The melody
of her voice charms my ear with the softest music,
as she incites me to partake of those delicious fruits,
which, with a smile that diffuses glory in the hea∣vens
and the earth, she presents to me. The spor∣tive
<PB N="13" REF="44"/>
cupids that attend her, fan me with their odo∣riferous
wings, or pour on my head the most fra∣grant
oils, or offer me their sparkling nectar in gol∣den
goblets. O! forever let me spread my limbs
on this bed of roses, and thus, thus feel the delici∣ous
moments with soft and downy steps glide along.
But, cruel chance! whither do ye flee so fast? Why
do my ardent wishes, and that load of pleasures
which you labour under, rather hasten than retard
your unrelenting pace? Suffer me to enjoy this soft
repose after all my fatigues, in search of happiness.
Suffer me to satiate myself with these delicacies,
after the pains of so long and so foolish an absti∣nence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>FAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of fame rules with such uncontrouled
authority in all generous minds, that it is often the
grand object of all their designs and undertakings.
By our continual and earnest pursuit of a character,
a name, a reputation in the world, we bring our
own deportment and conduct frequently in re∣view,
and consider how they appear in the eyes
of those who approach and regard us. This con∣stant
habit of surveying ourselves as it were in
reflection, keeps alive all the sentiments of right
and wrong, and begets, in noble natures, a certain
reverence for themselves as well as others, which is
the surest guardian of every virtue. The animal
conveniences and pleasure sink gradually in their
value; while every inward beauty and moral grace is
<PB N="14" REF="45"/>
studiously acquired, and the mind is accomplished
in every perfection which can adorn or embellish a
rational creature.</P>
<P>I was lately lamenting to a friend of mine, who
loves a conceit, that popular applause should be
bestowed with so little judgment, and that so many
empty forward coxcombs should rise up to a figure
in the world: upon which, he said, there was no∣thing
surprising in the case. "Popular same,"
says he, "is nothing but a breath of air; and air
very naturally presses into a vacuum."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>AMBITION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CANUTE,</HI> who was the greatest and most
powerful Prince of his time, Sovereign of <HI>Denmark</HI>
and <HI>Norway,</HI> as well as of <HI>England,</HI> could not fail
to meet with adulation from his courtiers; a tri∣bute
which is liberally paid even to the meanest
and weakest Princes. Some of his flatterers, break∣ing
out one day in admiration of his grandeur,
exclaimed, that every thing was possible for him:
upon which the Monarch, it is said, ordered his
chair to be set on the sea-shore, while the tide was
making; and, as the waters approached, he com∣manded
them to retire, and to obey the voice of him
who was Lord of the Ocean. He feigned to fit
some time in expectation of their submission; but
when the sea still advanced towards him, and be∣gan
to wash him with its billows, he turned to his
<PB N="15" REF="46"/>
courtiers, and remarked to them, that every crea∣ture
in the universe was feeble and impotent, and
that power resided with One Being alone, in whose
hands were all the elements of nature; who could
say to the ocean, "Thus far shalt thou go, and no
further;" and who could level with his nod the
most towering piles of human pride and ambition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>HUMAN ACTIVITY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no craving or demand of the human
mind more constant and insatiable, than that for
exercise and employment; and this desire seems the
foundation of most of our passions and pursuits.
Deprive a man of all business and serious occupa∣tion,
he runs restless from one amusement to an∣other;
and the weight and oppression which he
feels from idleness, is so great, that he forgets the
ruin which must follow from his immoderate ex∣pences.
Give him a more harmless way of em∣ploying
his mind or body, he is satisfied, and feels
no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure. But
if the employment you give him be profitable,
especially if the profit be attached to every parti∣cular
exertion of industry, he has gain so often in
his eye, that he acquires, by degrees, a passion for
it, and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing
the daily increase of his fortune.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="16" REF="47"/>
<HEAD>COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE utility of courage, both to the public, and
to the person possessed of it, is an obvious founda∣tion
of merit: but to any one who duly considers
of the matter, it will appear that this quality has
a peculiar lustre, which it derives wholly from it∣self,
and from that noble elevation inseparable
from it. Its figure, drawn by painters, and by
poets, displays in each feature a sublimity and
daring confidence, which catches the eye, engages
the affections, and diffuses, by sympathy, a like
sublimity of sentiment over every spectator.</P>
<P>The martial temper of the <HI>Romans,</HI> inflamed by
continual wars, had raised their esteem of courage
so high, that, in their language, it was called <HI>vir∣tue,</HI>
by way of excellence, and of distinction from
all other moral qualities. The <HI>Suevi,</HI> in the opi∣nion
of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> dressed their hair with a laudable
intent; not for the purpose of loving or being be∣loved:
they adorned themselves only for their ene∣mies,
and in order to appear more terrible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DUELLING.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING surely can be more absurd and bar∣barous
than the practice of duelling; but those
who justify it, say, that it begets civility and good-manners;
and a duellist always values himself upon
his courage, his sense of honour, his fidelity, and
<PB N="17" REF="48"/>
friendship; qualities which are here very oddly
directed, but which have been esteemed universally
since the foundation of the world.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MAGNANIMITY.</HEAD>
<P>OF the same class of virtues with courage, is
that undisturbed philosophical tranquillity, supe∣rior
to pain, sorrow, anxiety, and each assault of
adverse fortune. Conscious of his own virtue, the
Sage elevates himself above every accident of life,
and, securely placed in the temple of wisdom,
looks down on inferior mortals, engaged in
pursuits of honours, riches, reputation, and every
frivolous enjoyment. These pretensions, no doubt,
when stretched to the utmost, are by far too mag∣nificent
for human nature: they carry, however, a
grandeur with them, which seizes the spectator,
and strikes him with admiration: and, the nearer
we can approach, in practice, to this sublime tran∣quillity
and indifference, the more secure enjoy∣ment
shall we attain within ourselves, and the
more greatness of mind shall we discover to the
world. This philosophical tranquillity may, in∣deed,
be considered only as a branch of magnani∣mity.</P>
<P>Who admires not <HI>Socrates,</HI> his perpetual serenity
and contentment, amidst the greatest poverty and
domestic vexation; his resolute contempt of riches,
and magnanimous care of preserving liberty, while
<PB N="18" REF="49"/>
he refused all assistance from his friends and disci∣ples,
and avoided even the dependence of an obli∣gation?
<HI>Epictetus</HI> had not so much as a door to his
little house or hovel, and therefore soon lost his
iron lamp, the only furniture which he had, worth
taking: but, resolving to disappoint all robbers
for the future, he supplied its place with an earthen
lamp, of which he very peaceably kept possession
ever after.</P>
<P>The excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility
of <HI>Charles</HI> XII. ruined his own country, and in∣fested
all his neighbours, but have such splendour
and greatness in their appearance, as strike us with
admiration; and they might, in some degree, be
even approved of, if they betrayed not sometimes
too evident symptoms of madness and disorder.</P>
<P>Who can dispute, that a mind, which supports
a perpetual serenity and cheerfulness, a noble dig∣nity
and undaunted spirit, a tender affection and
good-will to all around, as it has more enjoyment
within itself, is also a more animating and rejoi∣cing
spectacle, than if dejected with melancholy,
tormented with anxiety, irritated with rage, or
sunk into the most abject baseness and degeneracy?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>POLITENESS.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mutual shocks in society, and the oppo∣sitions
of interest and self-love, have constrained
<PB N="19" REF="50"/>
mankind to establish the laws of justice, in order
to preserve the advantages of common assistance
and protection; in like manner, the eternal con∣trarieties,
in company, of men's pride and self-conceit,
have introduced the rules of good-man∣ners
or politeness, in order to facilitate the inter∣course
of minds, and an undisturbed commerce and
conversation. Among well-bred people, a mutual
deference is affected; contempt of others disguised;
authority concealed; attention given to each in his
turn; and an easy stream of conversation main∣tained,
without vehemence, without mutual inter∣ruption,
without eagerness for oratory, and with∣out
any airs of superiority. These attentions and
regards are immediately agreeable to others, abs∣tracted
from any consideration of utility or bene∣ficial
tendencies: they conciliate affection, promote
esteem, and extremely enhance the merit of the
person who regulates his behaviour by them.</P>
<P>Many of the forms of breeding are arbitrary
and casual; but the thing expressed by them is still
the same. A <HI>Spaniard</HI> goes out of his own house
before his guests, to signify that he leaves him
master of all: in other countries, the landlord
walks out last, as a common mark of deference
and regard.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY may be understood in different
senses. It sometimes means that tenderness and
<PB N="20" REF="51"/>
nicety of honour, that apprehension of blame, that
dread of intrusion or injury towards others, that
<HI>pudor,</HI> which is the proper guardian of every kind
of virtue, and a sure preservative against vice and
corruption: but its most usual meaning is, when
it is opposed to impudence and arrogance, and
expresses a diffidence of our own judgment, and
due attention and regard for others. In young
men, chiefly, this quality is a sure sign of good-sense,
and is also the certain means of augmenting
that endowment, by preserving their ears open to
instruction, and making them still grasp after new
entertainments. But it has a farther charm to
every spectator, by flattering every man's vanity,
and presenting the appearance of a docile pupil,
who receives, with proper attention and respect,
every word they utter.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful to observe what airs of superio∣rity
fools and knaves, with large possessions, give
themselves, above men of the greatest merit in po∣verty:
nor do the men of merit make any strong
opposition to these usurpations; or rather seem to
favour them, by the modesty of their behaviour.
Their good-sense and experience make them diffi∣dent
of their judgment, and cause them to examine
every thing with the greatest accuracy; as, on the
other hand, the delicacy of their sentiments makes
them timorous, left they commit faults, and lose,
in the practice of the world, that integrity of vir∣tue,
of which they are so jealous. To make wis∣dom
<PB N="21" REF="52"/>
agree with confidence, is as difficult as to re∣concile
vice to modesty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>HONOUR.</HEAD>
<P>NOR need we fear, that men, by losing their
ferocity, will lose their martial spirit, or become
less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their
country, or their liberty. The arts have no such
effect in enervating either the mind or body: on
the contrary, industry, their inseparable attendant,

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY.</HEAD>
<P>TO reconcile the indifference and contingency
of human actions with prescience; or to defend
absolute decrees, and yet free the Deity from be∣ing
the author of sin, has been found hitherto to
exceed all the power of Philosophy. Happy if she
be thence sensible of her temerity, when she pries
into these sublime mysteries; and, leaving a scene
so full of obscurities and perplexities, returns with
suitable modesty to her true and proper province,
the examination of common life; where she will
find difficulties enough to employ her enquiries,
<PB N="22" REF="53"/>
without launching into so boundless an ocean of
doubt, uncertainty, and contradiction!</P>
<P>What a malignant philosophy must it be, that
will not allow to humanity and friendship the same
privileges which are indisputably granted to the
darker passions of enmity and resentment! Such a
philosophy is more like a satire than a true deli∣neation
or description of human nature, and may
be a good foundation for paradoxical wit and rail∣lery,
but is a very bad one for any serious argu∣ment
or reasoning.</P>
<P>Though the philosophical truth of any proposition
by no means depends on its tendency to promote
the interest of society, yet a man has but a bad
grace who delivers a theory, however true, which,
he must confess, leads to a practice dangerous and
pernicious. Why rake into those corners of nature
which spread nuisance all around? Why dig up
the pestilence from the pit, in which it is buried?
The ingenuity of your researches may be admired,
but your systems will be detested: and mankind
will agree, if they cannot refute them, to sink
them, at least, in eternal silence and oblivion.
Truths which are pernicious to society, if any
such there be, will yield to errors which are salu∣tary
and advantageous.</P>
<P>But what philosophical truths can be more ad∣vantageous
to society, than those which represent
<PB N="23" REF="54"/>
Virtue in all her genuine and most engaging charms,
and make us approach her with ease, familiarity,
and affection? The dismal dress falls off, with
which many divines, and some philosophers, had
covered her; and nothing appears but gentleness,
humanity, beneficence, affability; nay, even, at
proper intervals, play, frolic, and gaiety. She
talks not of useless austerities and rigours, suffer∣ing
and self-denial. She declares, that her sole
purpose is to make her votaries, and all mankind,
during every instant of their existence, if possible,
chearful and happy; nor does she ever willingly
part with any pleasure, but in hopes of ample
compensation in some other period of their lives.
The sole trouble which she demands, is that of
just calculation, and a steady preference of the
greater happiness. And if any austere pretenders
approach her, enemies to joy and pleasure, she ei∣ther
rejects them as hypocrites and deceivers; or,
if she admits them in her train, they are ranked,
however, as the least favoured of her votaries.</P>
<P>Those who have a propensity to philosophy, will
still continue their researches; because they reflect,
that, besides the immediate pleasure attending such
an occupation, philosophical decisions are nothing
but the reflections of common life methodised and
corrected. But they will never be tempted to go
beyond common life, so long as they consider the
imperfection of those faculties which they employ,
their narrow reach, and their inaccurate operations.
<PB N="24" REF="55"/>
While we cannot give a satisfactory reason why we
believe, after a thousand experiments, that a stone
will fall, or fire burn; can we ever satisfy ourselves
concerning any determination which we may form
with regard to the origin of worlds, and the siua∣tion
of nature from and to eternity?</P>
<P>A man may as well pretend to cure himself of
love, by viewing his mistress through the artificial
medium of a microscope or prospect, and beholding
there the coarseness of her skin, and monstrous dis∣proportion
of her features, as hope to excite or
moderate any passion by the artificial arguments of
a Seneca or an Epictetus. The remembrance of
the natural aspect and situation of the object, will
in both cases still recur upon him. The reflections
of philosophy are too subtle and distant to take
place in common life, or eradicate any affection.
The air is too fine to breathe in, where it is above
the winds and clouds of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>His appears the most perfect charcter, who, re∣taining
an equal ability and taste for books, com∣pany,
and business, preserves in conversation that
discernment and delicacy, which are the natural
result of a just philosophy. In order to diffuse and
cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing can
be more useful than compositions of the easy style
and manner, which draw not too much from life,
require no deep application or retreat to be com∣prehended,
and send back the student among man∣kind
<PB N="25" REF="56"/>
full of noble sentiments and wise precepts,
applicable to every exigence of human life. By
means of such compositions, virtue becomes ami∣able,
science agreable, company instructive, and
retirement entertaining.</P>
<P>The easy and obvious philosophy will always,
with the generality of mankind, have the prefe∣rence
above the accurate and abstruse; and by
many will be recommended, not only as more
agreeable, but more useful, than the other. It en∣ters
more into common life; moulds the heart and
affections, and, by touching those principles which
actuate men, reforms their conduct, and brings
them nearer that model of perfection which it de∣scribes.
Abstruse philosophy, being founded on a
turn of mind which cannot enter into business and
action, vanishes when the philosopher leaves the
shade, and comes into open day; nor can its prin∣ciples
easily retain any influence over our conduct
and behaviour. The feelings of our heart, the
agitation of our passions, the vehemence of our
affections, dissipate all its conclusions, and reduce
the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.</P>
<P>In every art or profession, even those which most
concern life or action, a spirit of accuracy, how∣ever
acquired, carries all of them nearer their per∣fection,
and renders them more subservient to the
interests of society. And though a philosopher
may live remote from business, the genius of phi∣losophy,
<PB N="26" REF="57"/>
if carefully cultivated by several, must gra∣dually
diffuse itself throughout the whole society,
and bestow a similar correctness on every art and
calling. The politician will acquire greater fore∣sight
and subtlety in the subdividing and balancing
of power; the lawyer more method and finer prin∣ciples
in his reasonings; and the general more regu∣larity
in his discipline, and more caution in his
plans and operations. The stability of modern go∣vernments
above the ancient, and the accuracy of
modern philosophy, have improved, and probably
will still improve, by similar gradations.</P>

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHERS.</HEAD>
<P>WERE we to distinguish the ranks of men by
their genius and capacity, more than by their vir∣tue
and usefulness to the public, great philosophers
would certainly challenge the first rank, and must
be placed at the top of human kind. So rare is
this character, that, perhaps, there has not as yet
been above two in the world who can lay a just
claim to it: at least, <HI>Galileo</HI> and <HI>Newton</HI> seem to
me so far to excel all the rest, that I cannot admit
any other into the same class with them.</P>
<P>Moral philosophers consider man chiefly as born
for action, and as influenced in his actions by taste
and sentiment; pursuing one object, and avoiding
another, according to the value which these objects
seem to possess, and according to the light in which
they present themselves. As virtue, of all objects,
is allowed to be the most valuable, these philoso∣phers
paint her in the most amiable colours; bor∣rowing
all helps from poetry and eloquence, and
treating their subject in an easy and obvious man∣ner,
and such as is best fitted to please the imagi∣nation
and engage the affections. They select the
most striking observations and instances from com∣mon
life; place opposite character, in a proper con∣trast;
and, alluring us into the paths of virtue by
the views of glory and happiness, direct our steps
in these paths by the soundest precepts and most
illustrious examples. They make us feel the diffe∣rence
<PB N="28" REF="59"/>
between vice and virtue; they excite and re∣gulate
our sentiments; and so they can but bend
our hearts to the love of probity and true honour,
they think that they have fully attained the end of
all their labours.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>GALLANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>TO correct such gross vices as lead us to commit
real injury on others, is the part of morals, and
the object of the most ordinary education. Where
that is not attended to, in some degree, no human
society can subsist. But, in order to render conver∣sation,
and the intercourse of minds, more easy and
agreeable, good-manners have been invented, and
have carried the matter somewhat farther. Where∣ever
nature has given the mind a propensity to any
vice, or to any passion disagreeable to others, re∣fined
breeding has taught men to throw the biass
on the opposite side, and to preserve in all their
behaviour the appearance of sentiments different
from those to which they naturally incline. Thus,
as we are commonly proud and selfish, and apt to
assume the preference above others, a polite man
learns to behave with deference towards his com∣panions,
and to yield the superiority to them in all
the common incidents of society. In like manner,
wherever a person's situation may naturally beget
any disagreeable suspicion in him, it is the part of
good-manners to prevent it by a studied display of
sentiments directly contrary to those of which he
is apt to be jealous. Thus, old men know their
<PB N="29" REF="60"/>
infirmities, and naturally dread contempt from the
youth; hence, well-educated youth redouble the
instances of respect and deference to their elders.
Strangers and foreigners are without protection;
hence, in all polite countries, they receive the
highest civilities., and are intitled to the first place
in every company. A man is lord in his own fa∣mily,
and his guests are, in a manner, subject to
his authority; hence, he is always the lowest per∣son
in the company; attentive to the wants of every
one; and giving himself all the trouble, in order
to please, which may not betray too visible an af∣fectation,
or impose too much constraint on his
guests. Gallantry is nothing but an instance of
the same generous attention. As nature has given
man the superiority above woman, by endowing
him with greater strength both of mind and body,
it is his part to alleviate that superiority, as much
as possible, by the generosity of his behaviour, and
by a studied deference for all her inclinations and
opinions. Barbarous nations display this superio∣rity
by reducing their females to the most abject
slavery; by confining, them, by beating them, by
selling them, by killing them. But the male sex
among a polite people discover their authority in a
more generous, though not a less evident manner;
by civility, by respect, by complaisance, and, in
a word, by gallantry. In good company, you need
not ask who is the master of the feast. The man
who sits in the lowest place, and who is always indus∣trious
in helping every one, is certainly the person.
<PB N="30" REF="61"/>
We must either condemn all such instances of ge∣nerosity
as foppish and affected, or admit of gal∣lantry
among the rest. The ancient <HI>Muscovites</HI>
wedded their wives with a whip, instead of a ring.
The same people, in their own houses, took always
the precedence above foreigners, even foreign am∣bassadors.</P>
<P>Gallantry is not less consistent with wisdom and
prudence, than with nature and generosity; and,
when under proper regulations, contributes more
than any other invention to the entertainment and
improvement of both sexes. Among every species
of animals, nature has founded on the love between
the sexes their sweetest and best enjoyments. But
the satisfaction of the bodily appetite is not alone
sufficient to gratify the mind; and even among
brute creatures, we find that their play and dalli∣ance,
and other expressions of fondness, form the
greatest part of the entertainment. In rational be∣ings,
we must certainly admit the mind for a con∣siderable
share. Were we to rob the feast of all its
garniture of reason, discourse, sympathy, friend∣ship,
and gaiety, what remains would scarcely be
worth acceptance, in the judgment of the truly
elegant and luxurious.</P>

but the harmony of verse, the tenderness

pleasure. No man reasons concerning an∣other's

or injustice of his actions. In every criminal
trial, the first object of the prisoner is to disprove
she facts alledged, and deny the actions imputed
to him; the second, to prove that, even if these
actions were real, they might be justified, as in∣nocent

of the understanding, that the first point is ascer∣tained:
how can we suppose that a different faculty

or secret and unknown causes must have a
great influence on the rise and progress of all the
refined arts.</P>
<P><HI>Greece</HI> was a cluster of little principalities, which
soon became republics; and, being united both
by their near neighbourhood, and by the ties of
the same language and interest, they entered into
the closest intercourse of commerce and of learn∣ing.
There concurred a happy climate, a fertile
soil, and a most harmonious and comprehensive
<PB N="35" REF="66"/>
language; so that every circumstance among that
people seemed to favour the rise of the arts and
sciences. Each city produced its several artists
and philosophers, who refused to yield the pre∣ference
to those of the neighbouring republics.
Their debates and contentions sharpened the wits
of men: a variety of objects was presented to the
judgment; while each challenged the preference
to the rest: and the sciences, not being dwarfed by
the restraint of authority, were enabled to make
such considerable shoots, as are, even at this time,
the objects of our admiration.</P>
<P>It seems that Nature has pointed out a mixed
kind of life as most suitable to the human race.
Indulge your passion for science, says she; but let
your science be human, and such as may have a
direct reference to action and society. Abstruse
thought and profound researches I prohibit, and
will severely punish, by the pensive melancholy
which they introduce, by the endless uncertainty
in which they involve you, and by the cold recep∣tion
which your pretended discoveries shall meet
with, when communicated. Be a philosopher;
but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.</P>
<P>A serious attention to the sciences and liberal
arts softens and humanises the temper, and che∣rishes
those fine emotions in which true virtue and
honour consist. It rarely, very rarely, happens,
that a man of taste and learning is not, at least,
<PB N="36" REF="67"/>

The bent of his mind to speculative studies, must
mortify in him the passions of interest and ambi∣tion,
and must, at the same time, give him a

increased, by speculation.</P>

<P>To be happy, the passion must be chearful and

<HEAD>PROPERTY.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT other reason, indeed, could writers ever
give, why this must be mine, and that yours;
since uninstructed nature, surely, never made any
such distinction? The objects, which receive those
appellations, are, of themselves, foreign to us;
they are totally disjoined and. separated from us;
and nothing but the general interest of society can
form the connection.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="74"/>
What is a man's property? Any thing which it
is lawful for him, and for him alone, to use. But
what rule have we by which we can distinguish
these objects? Here we must have recourse to sta∣tutes,
customs, precedents, analogies, and a hun∣dred
other circumstances; some of which are con∣stant
and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary.
But the ultimate point, in which they all profes∣sedly
terminate, is, the interest and happiness of
human society. Where this enters not into consi∣deration,
nothing can appear more whimsical, un∣natural,
and even superstitious, than all or most of
the laws of justice, and of property.</P>

<HEAD>IMAGINATION.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more dangerous to reason than

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DELICACY OF PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME people are subject to a certain delicacy
of passion, which makes them extremely sensible
to all the accidents of life, and gives them a lively
joy upon every prosperous event, as well as a
piercing grief when they meet with misfortunes
and adversity. Favours and good offices easily en∣gage
their friendship; while the smallest injury
<PB N="44" REF="75"/>
provokes their resentment. Any honour or mark
of distinction elevates them above measure; but
they are as sensibly touched with contempt.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DELICACY OF TASTE</HEAD>
<P>IS itself a beauty in any character; as convey∣ing

<P>When you present a poem or a picture to a man
possessed of this talent, the delicacy of his feelings
makes him be sensibly touched with every part of
it; nor are the masterly strokes perceived with more
exquisite relish and satisfaction, than the negligen∣cies
and absurdities with disgust and uneasiness.
A polite and judicious conversation affords him the
highest entertainment; rudeness or impertinence is
as great a punishment to him.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>ART.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a great mortification to the vanity of man,
that his utmost art or industry can never equal the
meanest of Nature's productions, either for beauty
or value. Art is only the under workman, and is
employed to give a few strokes of embellishment
to those pieces which come from the hand of the
master. Some of the drapery may be of his draw∣ing;
but he is not allowed to touch the principal
figure. Art may make a suit of clothes, but Na∣ture

<HEAD>SIMPLICITY.</HEAD>
<P>NO advantages in this world are pure and un∣mixed.
In like manner as modern politeness,
which is naturally so ornamental, runs often into
affectation and foppery, disguise and insincerity;
so the ancient simplicity, which is naturally so
amiable and affecting, often degenerates into rusti∣city
and abuse, scurrility and obscenity. Simpli∣city
passes for dullness, when it is not accom∣panied
with great elegance and propriety.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>REFINEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>REFINEMENT on the pleasures and conveni∣ences
of life, has no natural tendency to beget
venality and corruption. The value which all men
put upon any particular pleasure, depends on com∣parison
and experience; nor is a porter less greedy
of money, which he spends upon bacon and bran∣dy,
than a courtier who purchases champagne and
ortolans. Riches are valuable at all times, and to
all men, because they always purchase pleasures,
such as men are accustomed to, and desire: nor
can any thing restrain or regulate the love of mo∣ney,
but a sense of honour and virtue; which, if
it be not nearly equal at all times, will naturally
abound most in ages of knowledge and refine∣ment.</P>

<HEAD>VANITY.</HEAD>
<P>VANITY seems to consist chiefly in such an
intemperate display of our advantages, honours,
and accomplishments, in such an importunate and
open demand of praise and admiration, as is offen∣sive
to others, and encroaches too far on their
secret vanity and ambition. It is, besides, the
sure symptom of the want of true dignity and ele∣vation
of mind, which is so great an ornament to
any character. For why that impatient desire of
applause; as if you were not justly entitled to it,
and might not reasonably expect that it will for
ever attend you? Why so anxious to inform us of
the great company you have kept; the obliging
things which were said to you; the honours, the
distinctions, which you met with; as if these were
not things of course, and what we could readily,
of ourselves, have imagined, without being told
of them?</P>
<P>Every thing belonging to a vain man, is the best
that is any where to be found: his houses, equi∣page,
furniture, clothes, horses, hounds, excel all
others, in his conceit; and it is easy to observe,
that, from the least advantage in any of these, he
draws a new subject of pride and vanity. His
wine, if you will believe him, has a finer flavour
than any other; his cookery is more exquisite; his
table more orderly; his servants more expert; the
air in which he lives, more healthful; the
<PB N="47" REF="78"/>
soil which he cultivates, more fertile; his fruits
ripen earlier, and to greater perfection: such a
thing is remarkable for its novelty, such another
for its antiquity; this is the workmanship of a fa∣mous
artist; that belonged once to such a prince
or great man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>MERIT.</HEAD>
<P>IT may justly appear surprising, that any man,
in so late an age, should find it requisite to prove,
by elaborate reasoning, that personal merit consists
altogether in the possession of mental qualities,
useful or agreeable to the person himself, or to
others. Whatever is valuable, in any kind, so
naturally classes itself under the division of useful
or agreeable, the <HI>utile</HI> or <HI>dulce,</HI> that it is not easy
to imagine, why we should ever seek farther, or
consider the question as a matter of nice research
or enquiry. And as every thing useful or agree∣able
must possess these qualities, with regard either
to the person himself, or to others, the complete
delineation or description of merit seems to be per∣formed
as naturally as a shadow is cast by the sun,
or an image is reflected upon water. If the ground
on which the shadow is cast, be not broken and
uneven, nor the surface from which the image is
reflected disturbed and confused, a just figure is
immediately presented, without any art or atten∣tion.
And it seems a reasonable presumption, that
systems and hypotheses have perverted our natural
<PB N="48" REF="79"/>
understanding, when a theory so simple and ob∣vious
could so long have escaped the most elabo∣rate
examination.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are very happy, we shall suppose one to
say, addressing himself to another, that you have
given your daughter to <HI>Cleanthes.</HI> He is a man of
honour and humanity; every one who has any in∣tercourse
with him, is sure of fair and kind treat∣ment.</P>
<P>I congratulate you, says another, on the pro∣mising
expectation of this son-in-law; whose assi∣duous
application to the study of the laws, whose
quick penetration, and early knowledge both of
men and business, prognosticate the greatest ho∣nours
and advancement.</P>
<P>You surprise me, replies a third, when you talk
of <HI>Cleanthes</HI> as a man of business and application.
I met him lately in a circle of the gayest company,
and he was the very life and soul of our conversa∣tion:
so much wit with good-manners, so much
gallantry without affectation, so much ingenious
knowledge so genteelly delivered, I have never
before observed in any one.</P>
<P>You would admire him still more, says a fourth,
if you knew him more familiarly. That chearful∣ness,
<PB N="49" REF="80"/>
which you might remark in him, is not a
sudden flash struck out by company; it runs
through the whole tenor of his life, and preserves
a perpetual serenity on his countenance, and tran∣quillity
in his soul. He has met with severe trials,
misfortunes as well as dangers, and by his great∣ness
of mind was still superior to all of them.</P>
<P>The image, gentlemen, which you have here
delineated of <HI>Cleanthes,</HI> cry I, is that of accom∣plished
merit. Each of you has given a stroke of
the pencil to his figure; and you have, unawares,
exceeded all the pictures drawn by <HI>Gratian</HI> or <HI>Ca∣stiglione.</HI>
A philosopher might select this character
as a model of perfect virtue.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DECENCY.</HEAD>
<P>DECENCY, or a proper regard to age, sex,
character, and station in the world, may be ranked
among the qualities which are immediately agree∣able
to others, and which, by that means, acquire
praise and approbation. An effeminate behaviour
in a man, a rough manner in a woman, are ugly,
because unsuitable to each character, and different
from the qualities which we expect in the sexes.
It is as if a tragedy abounded in comic beauties,
or a comedy in tragic. The disproportions hurt
the eye, and convey a disagreeable sentiment to
the spectators, the source of blame and disapproba∣tion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<PB N="50" REF="81"/>
<HEAD>CLEANLINESS.</HEAD>
<P>CLEANLINESS naturally renders us agreeable
to others, and is no inconsidarable source of love
and affection. No one will deny, that a negli∣gence
in this particular is a fault; and as faults
are nothing but smaller vices, and this fault can
have no other origin than the uneasy sensation
which it excites in others; we may in this instance,
seemingly so trivial, clearly discover the origin of
moral distinctions, about which the learned have
involved themselves in such mazes of perplexity
and error.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a manner, a grace, an ease, a gen∣teelness,
<HI>an I know not what,</HI> which some possess
above others, which is very different from external
beauty and comeliness; and which, however,
catches our affection almost as suddenly and pow∣erfully.
And though this manner be chiefly talked
of in the passion between the sexes, where the con∣cealed
magic is easily explained, yet surely much
of it prevails in all our estimation of characters,
and forms no inconsiderable part of personal merit.
This class of accomplishments, therefore, must be
trusted entirely to the blind, but sure testimony of
taste and sentiment; and must be considered as a
part of ethics left by nature to baffle all the pride
of Philosophy, and make her sensible of her nar∣row
boundaries and slender acquisitions.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="82"/>
<HEAD>CUSTOM.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREVER the repetition of any particular
act, or operation, produces a propensity to renew
the same act or operation, without being impelled
by any reasoning or process of the understanding,
we always say that this propensity is the effect of
custom. By employing that word, we pretend not
to have given the ultimate reason of such a pro∣pensity:
we only point out a principle of human
nature which is universally acknowledged, and
which is well known by its effects.</P>
<P>Custom is the great guide of human life. It is
that principle alone which renders our experience
useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future,
a similar train of events with those which have ap∣peared
in the past. Without the influence of cus∣tom
we should be entirely ignorant of every mat∣ter
of fact, beyond what is immediately present to
the memory and senses: we should never know
how to adjust means to ends, or to employ our na∣tural
powers in the production of any effect.
There would be an end, at once, of all action, as
well as of the chief part of speculation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">

<HEAD>PROSPERITY AND ADVERSITY.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine our own hearts, or observe what
passes around us, we shall find, that men are much
oftener thrown on their knees by the melancholy
than by the agreeable passions. Prosperity is easily
received as our due, and few questions are asked
concerning its cause or author. It begets chear∣fulness,
and activity, and alacrity, and a lively en∣joyment
of every sensual and social pleasure: and
during this state of mind, men have little leisure
or inclination to think of the unknown invisible
regions. On the other hand, every disastrous ac∣cident
alarms us, and sets us on enquiries con∣cerning
the principles whence it arose: apprehen∣sions
spring up with regard to futurity; and the
mind, sunk into diffidence, terror, and melancho∣ly,
has recourse to every method of appeasing those
secret intelligent Powers, on whom our fortune is
supposed entirely to depend.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>INCORRIGIBLE VICE.</HEAD>
<P>WHERE one is born of so perverse a frame of
mind, of so callous and insensible a disposition, as
to have no relish for virtue and humanity, no sym∣pathy
with his fellow-creatures, no desire of esteem
and applause; such an one must be allowed entirely
incurable; nor is there any remedy in philosophy.
He reaps no satisfaction but from low and sensual
objects, or from the indulgence of malignant pas∣sions:
<PB N="53" REF="84"/>
he feels no remorse to controul his vicious
inclinations: he has not even that sense or taste
which is requisite to make him desire a better cha∣racter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>HABIT.</HEAD>
<P>HABIT is another powerful means of reform∣ing
the mind, and implanting in it good disposi∣tions
and inclinations. A man who continues in
a course of sobriety and temperance, will hate riot
and disorder. If he engage in business or study,
indolence will seem a punishment to him. If he
constrain himself to practise beneficence and affa∣bility,
he will soon abhor all instances of pride
and violence. Where one is thoroughly convinced
that the virtuous course of life is preferable; if he
has but resolution enough, for some time, to im∣pose
a violence on himself, his reformation needs
not be despaired of. The misfortune is, that this
conviction and this resolution never can have place,
unless a man be beforehand tolerably virtuous.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>HUMAN LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD and ill are universally intermingled and
confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and
folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and en∣tirely
of a piece. All advantages are attended
with disadvantages. An universal compensation
prevails in all conditions of being and existence.
And it is not possible for us, by our most chimerical
wishes, to form the idea of a station, or situation,
<PB N="54" REF="85"/>
altogether desirable. The draughts of life, accord∣ing
to the poet's fiction, are always mixed from the
vessels on each hand of <HI>Jupiter:</HI> or if any cup be
presented altogether pure, it is drawn only, as the
same poet tells us, from the left-handed vessel.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty
of life, how despicable seem all our pursuits of
happiness! And even if we would extend our con∣cern
beyond our own life, how frivolous appear
our most enlarged and most generous projects;
when we consider the incessant changes and revo∣lutions
of human affairs, by which laws and learn∣ing,
books and governments, are hurried away by
time, as by a rapid stream, and are lost in the im∣mense
ocean of matter!</P>
<P>Human life is more governed by fortune than
by reason, is to be regarded more as a dull pastime
than as a serious occupation, and is more influenced
by particular humour than by general principles.
Shall we engage ourselves in it with passion and
anxiety? It is not worthy of so much concern.
Shall we be indifferent about what happens? We
lose all the pleasure of the game by our phlegm
and carelessness. While we are reasoning concern∣ing
life, life is gone; and Death, though perhaps
they receive him differently, treats alike the fool
and philosopher.</P>

The whole earth is cursed and polluted: a per∣petual
war amongst all living creatures. Neces∣sity,
hunger, want, stimulate the strong and cou∣rageous:
fear, anxiety, terror, agitate the weak

to the new-born infant, and to its wretched

stage of that life; and it is at last finished in ago∣ny

<HEAD>ANIMAL HOSTILITY.</HEAD>
<P>OBSERVE the curious artifices of nature, to
embitter the life of every living being! The
stronger prey upon the weaker, and keep them in
perpetual terror and anxiety: the weaker, too, in
their turn, often prey upon the stronger, and vex
and molest them without relaxation. Consider
that innumerable race of infects, which either are
bred in the body of each animal, or, flying about,
infix their stings in him! These infects have others
still less than themselves, which torment them.
And thus on each hand, before and behind, above

raise up to himself imaginary enemies, the
daemons of his fancy, who haunt him with super∣stitious
terrors, and blast every enjoyment of life?
His pleasure, as he imagines, becomes, in their
eyes, a crime; his food and repose give them um∣brage

new materials to anxious fear; and even death,
his refuge from every other ill, presents only the
dread of endless and innumerable woes: nor does
the wolf molest more the timid flock, than, super∣stition
does the anxious breast of wretched mortals.</P>
<P>This very society, by which we surmount those
wild beasts, our natural enemies; what new ene∣mies

<HEAD>MENTAL DISORDERS.</HEAD>

roads from these tormentors? How many have
scarce ever felt better sensations! Labour and po∣verty
so abhorred by every one, are the certain

persons, who enjoy case and opulence, never
reach contentment or true felicity. All the goods
of life united would not make a very happy man;

that it is a wonder they persuade not every man.
But perhaps they do occur to and persuade most
men, when they consider human life by a general
and calm survey. But where any real, affecting
incident happens; when passion is awakened, fancy
agitated, example draws, and counsel urges; the
philosopher is lost in the man, and he searches in
vain for that persuasion which before seemed so
firm and unshaken. What remedy for this incon∣venience?
Assist yourself by a frequent perusal of

Moral precepts, so couched, strike deep, and for∣tify
the mind against the illusion of passion. But
trust not altogether to external aid. By habit and
study acquire that philosophical temper, which
<PB N="60" REF="91"/>
both gives force to reflection, and, by rendering
a great part of your happiness independent, takes
off the edge from all disorderly passions, and tranquil∣lizes

its operations in a different manner from what it
does at present. Battles, revolutions, pestilence,
famine, and death, are never the effect of those
natural causes which we experience. Prodigies,
omens, oracles, judgments, quite obscure the few
natural events that are intermingled with them.
But, as the former grow thinner every page, in pro∣portion
as we advance nearer the enlightened ages,
we soon learn, that there is nothing mysterious or
supernatural in the case; but that all proceeds
from the usual propensity of mankind towards the

<HEAD>ELOQUENCE.</HEAD>
<P>ELOQUENCE, when at its highest pitch,

attains: but what a <HI>Tully</HI> or <HI>Demosthenes</HI> could
scarcely effect over a <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Athenian</HI> audience,
every Capuchin, every itinerant or stationary teach∣er,
can perform over the generality of mankind,
and in a higher degree, by touching such gross
and vulgar passions.</P>
<P>It may be pretended, that the disorders of the
ancient governments, and the enormous crimes of
which the citizens were often guilty, afforded much

ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with
among the moderns. Were there no <HI>Verres</HI> or <HI>Ca∣tiline,</HI>

<P>Does any man pretend to have more good-sense
than <HI>Julius Caesar?</HI> Yet that haughty conqueror,

change his settled purpose and resolution, and to
absolve a criminal, whom, before that orator ap∣peared,
he was determined to condemn.</P>

eloquence, first inflamed himself with anger, in∣dignation,
pity, sorrow; and then communicated
these impetuous movements to his audience.</P>
<P>There is a great prejudice against set speeches;
and a man can scarce escape ridicule, who repeats
a discourse as a school-boy does his lesson, and
takes no notice of any thing that has been ad∣vanced

the necessity of falling into this absurdity? A pub∣lic
speaker must know, before-hand, the question
under debate. He may compose all the arguments,
objections, and answers, such as he thinks will be
most proper for his discourse. If any thing new
occur, he may supply it from his invention;

nor will the difference be very apparent, betwixt
his elaborate and his extemporary compositions.

<HEAD>RIBALDRY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a set of men lately sprung up among
us, who endeavour to distinguish themselves by ri∣diculing
every thing that has hitherto appeared
sacred and venerable in the eyes of mankind.
Reason, sobriety, honour, friendship, marriage,
are the perpetual subjects of their insipid raillery:
and even public spirit, and a regard to our coun∣try,
are treated as chimerical and romantic. Were
the schemes of these anti-reformers to take place,
all the bonds of society must be broke, to make
<PB N="64" REF="95"/>
way for the indulgence of a licentious mirth and
gaiety: the companion of our drunken frolics
must be preferred to a friend or brother; dissolute
prodigality must be supplied at the expence of
every thing valuable, either in public or private;
and men shall have so little regard to any thing
beyond themselves, that, at last, a free constitu∣tion
of government must become a scheme perfectly
impracticable among mankind, and must degene∣rate
into one universal system of fraud and corrup∣tion.</P>

The Stoics were remarkable for this folly among
the ancients; and I wish some of more venerable
characters in latter times had not copied them too
faithfully. The virtuous and tender sentiments,
or prejudices, if you will, have suffered mightily
by these reflections; while a certain sullen pride,
or contempt of mankind, has prevailed in their

though in reality it be the most egregious folly.

on the errors of mistaken mortals, who
blindly seek for the true path of life, and pursue

He seeks for a prey that hides itself from

I have some difficulty to allow, because I have al∣ways

<P>WHEN a man can submit to the basest slavery

the vice we properly call Meanness. A cer∣tain

requisite, that the absence of it in the mind dis∣pleases;
after the same manner as the want of a

the face, or members of the body. View the pic∣ture
which <HI>Tacitus</HI> draws of <HI>Vitellius,</HI> fallen from
empire, prolonging his ignominy from a wretched
love of life, delivered over to the merciless rabble;

his head, and expose himself to every contumely.

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>LUXURY.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY, or a refinement on the pleasures
and conveniences of life, had long been supposed
the source of every corruption in government, and
the immediate cause of faction, sedition, civil wars,
and the total loss of liberty: it was therefore uni∣versally
regarded as a vice, and was an object of
declamation to all satirists and severe moralists.
Those who prove, or attempt to prove, that such
refinements rather tend to the increase of industry,
civility, and arts, regulate anew our moral as well
as political sentiments, and represent as laudable
and innocent what had formerly been regarded as
pernicious and blameable.</P>
<P>Let us consider what we call vicious luxury.
No gratification, however sensual, can of itself be
esteemed vicious: a gratification is only vicious
when it engrosses all a man's expence, and leaves
no ability for such acts of duty and generosity as
are required by his situation and fortune. Sup∣pose
<PB N="70" REF="101"/>
that he correct the vice, and employ part of his
expence in the education of his children, in the sup∣port
of his friends, and in relieving the poor; would
any prejudice result to society? On the contrary,
the same consumption would arise; and that labour
which at present is employed only in producing a
slender gratification to one man, would relieve the
necessitous, and bestow satisfaction on hundreds.
The same care and toil that raise a dish of pease
at <HI>Christmas,</HI> would give bread to a whole family
during six months. To say that, without a vi∣cious
luxury, the labour would not have been
employed at all, is only to say, that there is some
other defect in human nature, such as indolence,
selfishness, inattention to others, for which luxury
in some measure provides a remedy, as one poison
may be an antidote to another. But virtue, like
wholesome food, is better than poisons however
corrected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>BOOKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE good fortune of a book, and that of a
man, are not the same. The secret deceiving path
of life, which <HI>Horace</HI> talks of, <HI>fallentis semita vitae,</HI>
may be the happiest lot of the one, but is the
greatest misfortune which the other can possibly
fall into.</P>
<P>It is with books as with women, where a certain
plainness of manner and of dress is more engaging
than that glare of paint, and airs, and apparel,
<PB N="71" REF="102"/>
which may dazzle the eye, but reaches not the
affections. <HI>Terence</HI> is a modest and bashful beauty,
to whom we grant every thing, because he assumes
nothing, and whose purity and nature make a du∣rable,
though not a violent impression.</P>
<P>When we run over libraries, what havock must
we make! If we take in our hand any volume, of
divinity or school metaphysics, for instance, let us
ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning con∣cerning
quantity or number?—No. Does it con∣tain
any experimental reasoning concerning matter
of fact and existence?—No. Commit it then to
the flames: for it can contain nothing but so∣phistry
and illusion.</P>
<P>There is only one subject on which I am apt to
distrust the judgment of females, and that is, con∣cerning
books of gallantry and devotion, which
they commonly affect as high-flown as possible;
and most of them seem more delighted with the
warmth, than with the justness of the passion. I
mention gallantry and devotion as the same sub∣ject,
because, in reality, they become the same
when treated in this manner; and we may observe,
that they both depend upon the very same com∣plexion.
As the fair sex have a great share of the
tender and amorous disposition, it perverts their
judgment on this occasion, and makes them be
easily affected, even by what has no propriety in
the expression, nor nature in the sentiment. Mr.
<PB N="72" REF="103"/>
<HI>Addison</HI>'s elegant discourses of religion have no
relish with them, in comparison of books of mystic
devotion; and <HI>Otway</HI>'s Tragedies are rejected for

<HEAD>SUPERSTITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of man is subject to certain unac∣countable
terrors and apprehensions, proceeding
either from the unhappy situation of private or
public affairs, from ill health, from a gloomy and
melancholy disposition, or from the concurrence of
all these circumstances. In such a state of mind,
infinite unknown evils are dreaded from unknown
agents; and, where real objects of terror are want∣ing,
the soul, active to its own prejudice, and
fostering its predominant inclination, finds ima∣ginary
ones, to whose power and malevolence it
sets no limits. As these enemies are entirely invi∣sible
and unknown, the methods taken to appease
them are equally unaccountable, and consist in ce∣remonies,
observances, mortifications, sacrifices,
presents, or in any practice, however absurd or
frivolous, which either folly or knavery recom∣mends
to a blind and terrified credulity. Weak∣ness,
fear, melancholy, together with ignorance,
are, therefore, the true sources of superstition.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>THE SUBLIME.</HEAD>
<P>THE great charm of poetry consists in lively
pictures of the sublime passions, magnanimity,
<PB N="73" REF="104"/>
courage, disdain of fortune; or those of the ten∣der
affections, love and friendship; which warm
the heart, and diffuse over it similar sentiments
and emotions: and though all kinds of passion,
even the most disagreeable, such as grief and an∣ger,
are observed, when excited by poetry, to con∣vey
a satisfaction, from a mechanism of nature not
easy to be explained, yet those more elevated or
softer affections have a peculiar influence, and
please from more than one cause or principle; not
to mention, that they alone interest us in the for∣tune
of the persons represented, or communicate
any esteem and affection for their character.</P>
<P>And can it possibly be doubted, that this talent
itself of poets, to move the passions, this pathetic
and sublime of sentiment, is a very considerable
merit; and, being inhanced by its extreme rarity,
may exalt the person possessed of it above every
character of the age in which he lives? The
prudence, address, steadiness, and benign govern∣ment
of <HI>Augustus,</HI> adorned with all the splendour
of his noble birth and imperial crown, rendered
him but an unequal competitor for fame with
<HI>Virgil,</HI> who lays nothing in the opposite scale but
the divine beauties of his poetical genius.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DIOGENES AND PASCAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE foundation of <HI>Diogenes'</HI> conduct was an
endeavour to render himself an independent being
<PB N="74" REF="105"/>
as much as possible, and to confine all his wants
and desires and pleasures within himself and his
own mind. The aim of <HI>Pascal</HI> was to keep a per∣petual
sense of his dependence before his eyes, and
never to forget his numberless wants and infirmi∣ties.
The ancient supported himself by magnani∣mity,
oftentation, pride, and the idea of his own
superiority above his fellow creatures. The mo∣dern
made constant profession of humility and
abasement, of the contempt and hatred of him∣self,
and endeavoured to attain these supposed vir∣tues
as far as they are attainable. The austerities
of the <HI>Greek</HI> were in order to inure himself to hard∣ships,
and prevent his ever suffering. Those of
the <HI>Frenchman</HI> were embraced merely for their own
sake, and in order to suffer as much as possible.
The philosopher indulged himself in the most
beastly pleasures, even in public. The saint re∣fused
himself the most innocent, even in private.
The former thought it his duty to love his friends,
and to rail at them, and reprove them, and scold
them. The latter endeavoured to be absolutely
indifferent towards his nearest relations, and to
love and speak well of his enemies. The great ob∣ject
of <HI>Diogenes'</HI> wit was every kind of superstition,
that is, every kind of religion known in his time:
the mortality of the soul was his standard principle,
and even his sentiments of a divine providence
seem to have been licentious. The most ridiculous
superstitions directed <HI>Pascal</HI>'s faith and practice;
and an extreme contempt of this life, in comparison
<PB N="75" REF="106"/>
of the future, was the chief foundation of his con∣duct.</P>

There is not, however, any thing superna∣tural
in the case. Their fire is not kindled from

from one breast to another, and burns brightest

<P>THE most natural way of encouraging hus∣bandry

This method is infallible and universal.</P>

<HEAD>MODERN INVENTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>OUR superior skill in mechanics; the discovery

<HEAD>THE UNIVERSE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is very little ground, either from rea∣son
or observation, to conclude the world eternal
or incorruptible. The continual and rapid mo∣tion
of matter, the violent revolutions with which
every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the
heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of
an universal deluge, or general convulsion of
the elements; all these prove strongly the morta∣lity
of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by
corruption or dissolution, from one state or order
to another. It must, therefore, as well as each
individual form which it contains, have its in∣fancy,
youth, manhood, and old age; and it is
probable that, in all these variations, man, equally
with every animal and vegetable, will partake.
In the flourishing age of the world, it may be ex∣pected
that the human species should possess greater
vigour, both of mind and body, more prosperous
health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger
inclination and power of generation; but, if the
general system of things, and human society of
course, have any such gradual revolutions, they
are too slow to be discernible in that short period
which is comprehended by history and tradition.
Stature and force of body, length of life, even
courage, and extent of genius, seem hitherto to
<PB N="77" REF="108"/>
have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the
same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flou∣rished
in one period, and have decayed in another;
but, at the time when they rose to greatest perfection
among one people, they were, perhaps, totally un∣known
to all the neighbouring nations; and,
though they universally decayed in one age, yet
in a succeeding generation they again revived, and
diffused themselves over the world. As far, there∣fore,
as observation reaches, there is no universal
difference discernible in the human species; and
though it were allowed that the universe, like an
animal body, had a natural progress from infancy
to old-age, yet, as it must still be uncertain whe∣ther
at present it be advancing to its point of per∣fection,
or declining from it, we cannot thence
presuppose any decay in human nature.</P>

<HEAD>WIT AND TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>NO one has ever been able to tell precisely what

such another rejected. It is by taste alone we can
decide concerning it; nor are we possesed of any
other standard by which we can form a judgment
of this nature. Now, what is this taste, from
which true and false wit in a manner receive their
being, and without which no thought can have a
title to either of these denominations? It is plain∣ly
nothing but a sensation of pleasure from true
<PB N="78" REF="109"/>
wit, and of disgust from false, without our being
able to tell the reasons of that satisfaction or un∣easiness.
The power of exciting these opposite
sensations is, therefore, the very essence of true or
false wit; and, consequently, the cause of that
vanity or mortification which arises from one or
the other.</P>

<P>It is an infallible consequence of all industrious

connexion which binds them together, and

similar effects. This is the sum of all our experi∣mental

<P>The sweetest and most inoffensive path of life

far to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind.</P>
<P>Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind, as

<HEAD>THE ANGLO-SAXONS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE, we must conceive, were very little re∣moved
from the original state of nature: the social
state among them was more martial than civil:
they had chiefly in view the means of attack or
defence against public enemies, not those of pro∣tection
against fellow-citizens: their possessions
were so slender, and so equal, that they were not
exposed to great dangers; and the natural bravery
of the people made every man trust to himself, and
to his particular friends, for his defence or ven∣geance.
This defect in the political union drew
much closer the knot of particular confederacies.
An insult upon any man was regarded by all his
relations and associates as a common injury: they
were bound, by honour as well as by a sense of
general interest, to revenge his death, or any vio∣lence
which he had suffered. They retaliated on
the aggressor by like violences; and if he was
protected, as was natural and usual, by his own
clan, the quarrel was spread still wider, and bred
endless disorder in the nation.</P>

<P>'TIS more easy to account for the rise and pro∣gress

the encouragement of the one, would be much
more assured of success, than one which should
cultivate the other. Avarice, or the desire of gain,
is an universal passion, that operates at all times,
in all places, and upon all persons: but curiosity,
or the love of knowledge, has but a very limited
influence, and requires youth, leisure, education,
genius, and example, to make it govern any per∣son.
You will never want booksellers while there

no new imposition, which may serve as the foun∣dation
of a new loan; and let us consider the ne∣cessary
consequences of this situation. Though
the imperfect state of our political knowledge, and

<HEAD>PUBLIC BANKRUPTCY.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been computed, that all the creditors of
the public, natives and foreigners, amount only
to seventeen thousand. These make a figure at
present on their income; but, in case of a public
bankruptcy, would, in an instant, become the low∣est
as well as the most wretched of the people.
The dignity and authority of the landed gentry
and nobility is much better rooted; and would
render the contention very unequal, if ever we
come to that extremity. One would incline to as∣sign
to this event a very near period, such as half
a century, had not our fathers prophecies of this
kind been found fallacious, by the duration of our
public credit so much beyond all reasonable ex∣pectation.
When the astrologers in <HI>France</HI> were

"these fellows," says he, "must be right at last."</P>
<P>When the nation becomes heartily sick of her

daring projector may arise with visionary schemes
for their discharge: and as public credit will be∣gin,
by that time, to be a little frail, the least
touch will destroy it, as happened in <HI>France</HI> du∣ring
the regency; and in this manner <HI>it will die of
the doctor.</HI></P>
<P>Let the time come, and surely it will come,
when the new funds created for the exigencies of
the year are not subscribed to, and raise not the
<PB N="91" REF="122"/>
money projected. Suppose either that the cash of
the nation is exhausted; or that our faith, which
has been hitherto so ample, begins to fail us: sup∣pose
that, in this distress, the nation is threatened
with an invasion; a rebellion is suspected, or broken
out at home; a squadron cannot be equipped, for
want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a fo∣reign
subsidy cannot be advanced. What must a
prince or minister do in such an emergence? The
right of self-preservation is unalienable in every
individual, much more in every community: and
the folly of our statesmen must then be greater
than the folly of those who first contracted debt,
or, what is more, than that of those who trusted,
or continue to trust, this security, if these states∣men
have the means of safety in their hands, and
do not employ them. The funds created and
mortgaged, will, by that time, bring in a large
yearly revenue, sufficient for the defence and secu∣rity
of the nation: money is perhaps lying in the
Exchequer, ready for the discharge of the quar∣terly
interest: necessity calls, fear urges, reason
exhorts, compassion alone exclaims: the money
will immediately be seized for the current service,
under the most solemn protestations, perhaps, of
being immediately replaced. But no more is re∣quisite.
The whole fabric, already tottering, falls
to the ground, and buries thousands in its ruins.</P>
<P>Here thousands are sacrificed to the safety of mil∣lions;
but we are not without danger that millions

may be sacrificed for ever to the temporary safety
of thousands. Our popular government, perhaps,
will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister
to venture on so desperate an expedient, as that
of a voluntary bankruptcy. And though the House
of Lords be altogether composed of proprietors of
land, and the House of Commons chiefly; and
consequently neither of them can be supposed to
have great property in the funds: yet the connec∣tions
of the members may be so great with the
proprietors, as to render them more tenacious of
public faith, than prudence, policy, or even jus∣tice,
strictly speaking, requires. And perhaps,
too, our soreign enemies may be so politic as to
discover, that our safety lies in despair, and may
not therefore shew the danger open and bare-faced,
till it be inevitable. The balance of power in
<HI>Europe,</HI> our grandfathers, our fathers, and we,
have all esteemed too unequal to be preserved
without our attention and assistance. But our
children, weary of the struggle, and fettered with
incumbrances, may sit down secure, and see their
neighbours oppressed and conquered; till, at last,
they themselves and their creditors lie both at the
mercy of the conqueror. And this may properly
enough be denominated the violent death of our

say, will not be a mixed government: for so great
is the natural ambition of men, that they are never

pursuing its own interest, can usurp upon every
other order, it will certainly do so, and render it∣self,

<P>THERE has been a sudden and sensible change

all superstitious reverence to names and authority:
the clergy have much lost their credit: their pre∣tensions
and doctrines have been ridiculed; and
even religion can scarcely support itself in the
world. The mere name of King commands little
respect; and to talk of a King as God's vicegerent
on earth, or to give him any of those magnificent
titles which formerly dazzled mankind, would
but excite laughter in every one. Though the
Crown, by means of its large revenue, may main∣tain
its authority, in times of tranquillity, upon
private interest and influence; yet, as the least
shock or convulsion must break all these interests
to pieces, the royal power, being no longer sup∣ported
by the settled principles and opinions of
men, will immediately dissolve. Had men been
in the same disposition at the Revolution, as they

<HEAD>THE INFLUENCE OF THE CROWN.</HEAD>
<P>UPON a moderate computation, there are near
three millions at the disposal of the Crown. The
civil list amounts to near a million; the collection
of all taxes, to another; and the employments in
the army and navy, together with ecclesiastical
preferments, to above a third million: an enor∣mous
sum, and what may fairly be computed to
be more than a thirtieth part of the whole income
and labour of the kingdom. When we add to this
great property, the increasing luxury of the na∣tion,
our proneness to corruption, together with
the great power and prerogatives of the Crown,
and command of military force, there is no one
but must despair of being able, without extraor∣dinary
efforts, to support our free government
much longer, under these disadvantages.</P>
<P>The Crown has so many offices at its disposal,
that, when assisted by the honest and disinterested
<PB N="96" REF="127"/>
part of the house, it will always command the re∣solutions
of the whole; so far, at least, as to pre∣serve
the ancient constitution from danger. We
may give to this influence what name we please.
We may call it by the invidious appellation of Cor∣ruption
and Dependence; but some degree and
some kind of it are inseparable from the very na∣ture

of our mixed government.</P>

<P>To whom is allegiance due? and who are our

When people are so happy that they can answer,
Our present sovereign, who inherits in a direct line
from ancestors that have governed us for many
ages, this answer admits of no reply; even though
historians, in tracing up to the remotest antiquity
<PB N="97" REF="128"/>
the origin of that royal family, may find, as com∣monly
happens, that its first authority was derived
from usurpation and violence. It is confessed that
private justice, or the abstinence from the proper∣ties
of others, is a most cardinal virtue; yet rea∣son
tells us, that there is no property in durable
objects, such as lands or houses, when carefully
examined, in passing from hand to hand, but must
in some period have been founded in fraud and
injustice. The necessities of human society, nei∣ther
in public nor private life, will allow of such
an accurate enquiry.</P>

<HEAD>MONARCHIES.</HEAD>
<P>ENORMOUS monarchies are, probably, de∣structive
to human nature, in their progress, in
their continuance, and even in their downfall,
which never can be very distant from their esta∣blishment.
The military genius, which aggran∣dised
the monarchy, soon leaves the court, the
capital, and the centre of such a government,
while the wars are carried on at a great distance,
and interest so small a part of the state. The an∣cient
nobility, whose affections attach them to the
sovereign, live all at court, and never will accept
of military employments, which would carry them
to remote and barbarous frontiers, where they are
distant both from their pleasure and their fortune.
The arms of the state must therefore be in trusted to
mercenary strangers, without zeal, without attach∣ment,
<PB N="98" REF="129"/>
without honour; ready on every occasion
to turn them against the prince, and join each de∣sperate
malcontent who offers pay and plunder.
This is the necessary progress of human affairs.
Thus human nature checks itself in its airy eleva∣tion.

not of the scarcity of gold and silver.
Low interest, on the other hand, proceeds from
the three opposite circumstances; a small demand
for borrowing, great riches to supply that demand,

not of gold and silver.</P>

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE people, if we trace government to its first

all power and jurisdiction, and voluntarily, for the
sake of peace and order, abandoned their native
liberty, and received laws from their equal and
companion. The conditions upon which they were
willing to submit were either expressed, or were
so clear and obvious that it might well be deemed
superfluous to express them. If this, then, be the
original contract, it cannot be denied that all go∣vernment
is, at first, founded on a contract, and
that the most ancient rude combinations of man∣kind
were formed intirely by that principle. In
vain are we asked, in what records this charter of
our liberties is registered? It was not writ in
parchment, nor yet on leaves, or barks of trees;
it preceded the use of writing, and all other civi∣lised

By deciding many important questions in favour

it gave such an ascendant to popular prin∣ciples,

<HEAD>THE DISPENSING POWER IN THE
CROWN.</HEAD>
<P>MEN deemed a dispensing power to be in fact
the same with a repealing power; and they could
not conceive that less authority was requisite to re∣peal
than to enact any statute. If one penal law
was dispensed with, any other might undergo the
same fate; and by what principle could even the
laws which define property be afterwards secured
from violation? The Test act had ever been con∣ceived
the great barrier of the established religion
under a popish successor: as such it had been in∣sisted
on by the parliament; as such, granted by the
king; as such, during the debates with regard to
the exclusion, recommended by the chancellor:—
by what magic, what chicane of law, is it now
annihilated, and rendered of no validity? These
questions were every where asked; and men, strait∣ened
by precedents and decisions of great autho∣rity,
were reduced either to question the antiquity
of this prerogative itself, or to assert that even the
practice of five centuries could not bestow on it suf∣ficient
<PB N="101" REF="132"/>
authority. It was not considered that the
present difficulty, or seeming absurdity, had pro∣ceeded
from late innovations introduced into the
government. Ever since the beginning of this
century, the parliament had, with the most lau∣dable
zeal, been acquiring powers, and establish∣ing
principles, favourable to law and liberty; the
authority of the crown had been limited in many
important particulars; and penal statutes were
often calculated to secure the constitution against
the attempts of ministers, as well as to preserve
general peace, and repress crimes and immorali∣ties.
A prerogative, however, derived from very
ancient and almost uniform practice, the dispen∣sing
power, still remained, or was supposed to re∣main,
with the crown, sufficient in an instant to
overturn this whole fabric, and to throw down all
the fences of the constitution. If this prerogative,
which carries on the face of it such strong sym∣ptoms
of an absolute authority in the crown, had
yet, in ancient times, subsisted with some degree
of liberty in the subject, this fact only proves, that
scarce any human government, much less one erect∣ed
in rude and barbarous times, is entirely con∣sistent
and uniform in all its parts. But to expect
that the dispensing power could in any degree be
rendered compatible with those accurate and re∣gular
limitations which had of late been establish∣ed,
and which the people were determined to
maintain, was a vain hope; and though men
knew not on what principles they could deny that
<PB N="102" REF="133"/>
prerogative, they saw, that, if they would pre∣serve
their laws and constitution, there was an
absolute necessity for denying, or, at least, for
abolishing it. The Revolution alone, which soon
succeeded, happily put an end to all these disputes:
by means of it a more uniform edifice was at last
erected; the monstrous inconsistence, so visible,
between the ancient <HI>Gothic</HI> parts of the fabric and
the recent plans of liberty, was fully corrected;
and, to their mutual felicity, king and people were
finally taught to know their proper limits and
boundaries.</P>

<HEAD>OBEDIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>OBEDIENCE, or subjection, becomes so fami∣liar,

of nature: or, if curiosity ever move them, as soon
as they learn that they themselves and their an∣cestors
have, for several ages, or for time imme¦morial,
been subject to such a government or such
a family, they immediately acquiesce, and acknow∣ledge
their obligation to allegiance. Were you to
preach, in most parts of the world, that political
connexions are founded altogether on voluntary
consent, or a mutual promise, the magistrate would
soon imprison you, as seditious, for loosening the
ties of obedience, if your friends did not before
shut you up as delirious, for advancing such ab∣surdities.</P>

<PB N="103" REF="134"/>
<HEAD>RESISTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>IF ever, on any occasion, it were laudable to
conceal truth from the populace, it must be con∣fessed,
that the doctrine of resistance affords such
an example, and that all speculative reasoners
ought to observe, with regard to this principle,
the same cautious silence which the laws, in every
species of government, have ever prescribed to
themselves. Government is instituted, in order to
restrain the fury and injustice of the people; and
being always founded on opinion, not on force,
it is dangerous to weaken, by these speculations,
the reverence which the multitude owe to autho∣rity,
and to instruct them before-hand, that the
case can ever happen, when they may be freed
from their duty of allegiance. Or, should it be
found impossible to restrain the licence of human
disquisitions, it must be acknowledged, that the
doctrine of obedience ought alone to be inculcated;
and that the exceptions, which are very rare, ought
seldom or never to be mentioned in popular rea∣sonings
and discourses. Nor is there any danger,
that mankind, by this prudent reserve, should
universally degenerate into a state of abject servi∣tude.
Where the exception really occurs, even
though it be not previously expected and descanted
on, it must from its very nature be so obvious and
undisputed, as to remove all doubt, and overpower
the restraint, however great, imposed by teaching
the general doctrine of obedience. But between
<PB N="104" REF="135"/>
resisting a prince and dethroning him, there is a
very wide interval; and the abuses of power which
can warrant the latter violence, are much greater
and more enormous than those which will justify
the former. History, however, supplies us with
examples even of this kind; and the reality of this
supposition, though for the future it ought ever to
be little looked for, must, by all candid enquirers,
be acknowledged in the past. But between the
dethroning a prince, and punishing him, there is
another very wide interval; and it were not strange,
if even men of the most enlarged thought should
question, whether human nature could ever, in any
monarch, reach that height of depravity, as to
warrant in revolted subjects this last act of extra∣ordinary
jurisdiction. That illusion, if it be an
illusion, which teaches us to pay a sacred regard
to the persons of princes, is so salutary, that to
dissipate it by the formal trial and punishment of a
sovereign, will have more pernicious effects upon
the people, than the example of justice can be
supposed to have a beneficent influence upon
princes, by checking their career of tyranny. 'Tis
dangerous also, by these examples, to reduce princes

<HEAD>THE EUTHANASIA OF THE BRITISH
CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS one kind of death may be preferable to an∣other,
it may be enquired, whether it be more de∣sirable
for the <HI>British</HI> constitution to terminate in
a popular government, or in absolute monarchy?
Here I would frankly declare, that, though liberty
be preferable to slavery, in almost every case, yet
I should rather wish to see an absolute monarchy
than a republic in this island: for, let us consider
what kind of republic we have reason to expect.
The question is not concerning any fine imaginary
republic, of which a man may form a plan in his
closet. There is no doubt, but a popular govern∣ment
may be imagined more perfect than absolute
monarchy, or even than our present constitution.
But what reason have we to expect that any such
government will ever be established in <HI>Britain,</HI>
upon the dissolution of our monarchy? If any
single person acquire power enough to take our
constitution to pieces, and put it up a-new, he is
really an absolute monarch; and we have already
had an instance of this kind, sufficient to convince
us, that such a person will never resign his power,
<PB N="106" REF="137"/>
or establish any free government. Matters, there∣fore,
must be trusted to their natural progress and
operation; and the House of Commons, according
to its present constitution, must be the only legis∣lator
in such a popular government. The incon∣veniences
attending such a situation of affairs pre∣sent
themselves by thousands. If the House of
Commons, in such a case, ever dissolve itself, which
is not to be expected, we may look for a civil war
every election. If it continue itself, we shall suffer
all the tyranny of a faction, subdivided into new
factions. And, as such violent government can∣not
long subsist, we shall at last, after many con∣vulsions
and civil wars, find repose in absolute mo∣narchy,
which it would have been happier for us
to have established peaceably from the beginning.
Absolute monarchy, therefore, is the easiest death;
the true <HI>Euthanasia</HI> of the <HI>British</HI> constitution.</P>

<HEAD>THE DOWNFALL OF THE ROMAN
EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE period was now come when that enormous
fabric of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, which had diffused
slavery and oppression, together with peace and
civility, on so considerable a part of the globe,
was approaching towards its final dissolution.
<HI>Italy,</HI> and the centre of the empire, removed du∣ring
so many ages from all concern in the wars,
had entirely lost the military spirit, and were peo∣pled
by an enervated race, equally disposed to sub∣mit
to a foreign yoke, or to the tyranny of their
<PB N="107" REF="138"/>
own rulers. The emperors found themselves ob∣liged
to recruit their legions from the frontier
provinces, where the genius of war, though lan∣guishing,
was not totally extinct; and these mer∣cenary
forces, careless of laws and civil institu∣tions,
established a military government, no less
dangerous to the sovereign than to the people.
The farther progress of the same disorders intro∣duced
the bordering barbarians into the service of
the <HI>Romans;</HI> and those fierce nations, having now
added discipline and skill to their native bravery,
could no longer be restrained by the impotent po∣licy
of the emperors, who were accustomed to em∣ploy
the one in the destruction of the other. Sen∣sible
of their own force, and allured by the pro∣spect
of so rich a prize, the Northern barbarians,
in the reign of <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI> assailed at
once all the frontiers of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire; and,
having first satiated their avidity by plunder, be∣gan
to think of fixing a settlement in the wasted
provinces. The more distant barbarians, who oc∣cupied
the deserted habitations of the former, ad∣vanced
in their acquisitions, and pressed with their
incumbent weight the <HI>Roman</HI> state, already un∣equal
to the load which it sustained. Instead of
arming the people in their own defence, the em∣perors
recalled all the distant legions, in whom
alone they could repose confidence, and collected
the whole military force for the defence of the ca∣pital
and centre of the empire. The necessity of
self-preservation had superseded the ambition of
<PB N="108" REF="139"/>
power; and the ancient point of honour, of never
contracting the limits of the empire, could no
longer be attended to in this desperate extremity.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>BRITAIN AND ROME.</HEAD>
<P>WE are to consider the <HI>Roman</HI> government, un∣der
the emperors, as a mixture of despotism and
liberty, where the despotism prevailed; and the
<HI>English</HI> government as a mixture of the same kind,
where the liberty predominates. The consequences
are such as may be expected from those mixed
forms of government, which beget a mutual
watchfulness and jealousy. The <HI>Roman</HI> emperors
were, many of them, the most frightful monsters
that ever disgraced human nature; and it is evi∣dent,
their cruelty was chiefly excited by their
jealousy, and by their observing that all the great
men of <HI>Rome</HI> bore with impatience the dominion
of a family which, but a little before, was no way
superior to their own. On the other hand, as the
republican part of the government prevails in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
though with a great mixture of monarchy,
it is obliged, for its own preservation, to maintain
a watchful jealousy over the magistrates, to remove
all discretionary powers, and to secure every one's
life and fortune by general and inflexible laws:
no action must be deemed a crime but what the
law has plainly determined to be such; no crime
must be imputed to a man, but from a legal proof
before his judges; and even these judges must be
<PB N="109" REF="140"/>
his fellow subjects, who are obliged by their own
interest to have a watchful eye over the incroach∣ments
and violence of the ministers. From these
causes it proceeds that there is as much liberty,
and even perhaps licentiousness, in <HI>Britain,</HI> as
there were formerly slavery and tyranny in <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>It is a trite, but not altogether a false maxim,
that priests of all religions are the same; and,
though the character of the profession will not, in

yet is it sure always to predominate with the
greater number. As chymists observe, that spirits,

from whatever materials they be extracted; so
these men, being elevated above humanity, ac∣quire
a uniform character, which is entirely their

speaking, not the most amiable that is to be met
with in human society. Most men are ambitious;
but the ambition of other men may commonly be
satisfied by excelling in their particular profession,
and thereby promoting the interest of society.
The ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied

<HEAD>LORD FALKLAND.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE assembling the present parliament,
this man, devoted to the pursuits of learning, and
to the society of all the polite and elegant, had
enjoyed himself in every pleasure which a fine ge∣nius,
a generous disposition, and an opulent for∣tune,
could afford. Called into public life, he
stood foremost in all attacks on the exorbitant pre∣rogative
of the crown; and displayed that mascu∣line
eloquence, and undaunted love of liberty,
which, from his intimate acquaintance with the
sublime spirits of antiquity, he had greedily im∣bibed.
When civil convulsions proceeded to ex∣tremity,
and it became requisite for him to chuse
his side, he tempered the ardour of his zeal, and
embraced the defence of those limited powers which
remained to monarchy, and which he deemed ne∣cessary
for the support of the <HI>English</HI> constitution.
Still anxious, however, for his country, he seems
to have dreaded the too prosperous success of his
own party as much as of the enemy; and, among
his intimate friends, often, after a deep silence,
and frequent sighs, he would with a sad accent
reiterate the word <HI>peace.</HI> In excuse for the too
free exposing of his person, which seemed unsuit∣able
in a secretary of state, he alledged that it
<PB N="114" REF="145"/>
became him to be more active than other men in
all hazardous enterprises, lest his impatience for
peace might bear the imputation of cowardice or
pusillanimity. From the commencement of the
war, his natural chearfulness and vivacity became
clouded; and even his usual attention to dress,
required by his birth or station, gave way to a
negligence which was easily observable. On the
morning of the battle in which he fell, he had
shewn some care for the adorning his person; and
gave for a reason, that the enemy should not find
his body in any slovenly, indecent situation. "I

<P>THE merit of this prince, both in private and

of that perfect character, which, under the deno∣mination
of a sage, or wise man, the philosophers
have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction
of their imagination, than in hopes of ever seeing
it reduced to practice: so happily were all his vir∣tues
tempered together, so justly were they blend∣ed,
and so powerfully did each prevent the other
from exceeding its proper bounds! He knew how
<PB N="115" REF="146"/>
to conciliate the boldest enterprise with the coolest
moderation; the most obstinate perseverance with
the easiest flexibility; the most severe justice with
the greatest lenity; the most vigorous command
with the greatest affability of deportment; the
highest capacity and inclination for science with
the most shining talents for action. His civil and
military virtues are almost equally the objects of
our admiration; excepting only, that the former
being more rare among princes, as well as more
useful, seem chiefly to challenge our applause.
Nature, also, as if desirous that so bright a pro∣duction
of her skill mould be set in the fairest light,
had bestowed on him all bodily accomplishments;
vigour of limbs, dignity of shape and air, and a
pleasant, engaging, and open countenance. For∣tune
alone, by throwing him into that barbarous
age, deprived him of historians worthy to trans∣mit
his fame to posterity; and we wish to see him

<HEAD>THE IRISH MASSACRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Irish,</HI> every where intermingled with the
<HI>English,</HI> needed but a hint from their leaders and
priests to begin hostilities against a people, whom
they hated on account of their religion, and envied
for their riches and prosperity. The houses, cattle,
<PB N="116" REF="147"/>
goods, of the unwary <HI>English</HI> were first seized. Those
who heard of the commotion in their neighbourhood,
instead of deserting their habitations, and flocking
together for mutual protection, remained at home in
hopes of defending their property, and fell thus
separately into the hands of their enemies. After
rapacity had fully exerted itself, cruelty, and the
most barbarous that ever, in any nation, was known,
or heard of, began its operations. An universal
massacre commenced of the <HI>English,</HI> now defence∣less,
and passively resigned to their inhuman foes.
No age, no sex, no condition, was spared. The
wise, weeping for her butchered husband, and em∣bracing
her helpless children, was pierced with
them, and perished by the same stroke. The old,
the young, the vigorous, the infirm, underwent
a like fate, and were confounded in one common
ruin. In vain did flight save from the first assault;
Destruction was, every where, let loose, and met
the hunted victims at every turn. In vain was re∣course
had to relations, to companions, to friends.
All connection was dissolved; and death was dealt
by that hand, from which protection was implored
and expected. Without provocation, without op∣position,
the astonished <HI>English,</HI> living in profound
peace and full security, were massacred by their
nearest neighbours, with whom they had long up∣held
a continued intercourse of kindness and good
offices.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="148"/>
But death was the lightest punishment inflicted
by those more than barbarous savages: all the
tortures which wanton cruelty could devise, all
the lingering pains of body, the anguish of mind,
the agonies of despair, could not satiate revenge
exacted without injury, and cruelty derived from
no cause. To enter into particulars, would shock
the least delicate humanity. Such enormities,
though attested by undoubted evidence, appear al∣most
incredible. Depraved nature, even perverted
religion, though encouraged by the utmost licence,
reach not to such a pitch of ferocity; unless the
pity inherent in human breasts, by that contagion
of example, which transports men beyond all the
usual motives of conduct and behaviour, be anni∣hilated.</P>
<P>The weaker sex themselves, naturally tender to
their own sufferings, and compassionate to those of
others, here emulated their more robust compa∣nions
in the practice of every cruelty. Even chil∣dren,
taught by the example, and encouraged by
the exhortation, of their parents, assayed their
feeble blows on the dead carcases or defenceless
children of the <HI>English.</HI> The very avarice of the
<HI>Irish</HI> was not a sufficient restraint to their cruelty.
Such was their frenzy, that the cattle which they
had seized, and by rapine had made their own,
yet, because they bore the name of <HI>English,</HI> were
wantonly slaughtered, or, when covered with
wounds, turned loose into the woods and deserts.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="149"/>
The stately buildings or commodious habitations
of the planters, as if upbraiding the sloth and
ignorance of the natives, were consumed with sire,
or laid level with the ground. And where the
miserable owners, shut up in their houses, and
preparing for defence, perished in the flames, to∣gether
with their wives and children, a double
triumph was afforded to these insulting butchers.</P>
<P>If any where a number assembled together, and,
assuming courage from despair, were resolved to
sweeten death by a revenge of their assassins; they
were disarmed by capitulations, and promises of
safety, confirmed by the most solemn oaths; but
no sooner had they surrendered, than the rebels,
with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> equal to their cruelty, made them
share the fate of their unhappy countrymen.</P>
<P>Others, more ingenious still in their barbarity,
tempted their prisoners, by the fond love of life,
to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends, bro∣thers,
parents; and, having thus rendered them
accomplices in their guilt, gave them that death
which they sought to shun by deserving it.</P>
<P>Amidst all these enormities, the sacred name of
religion resounded on every side, not to stop the
hands of these savages, but to enforce their blows,
and to steel their hearts against every movement of
human or social sympathy. The <HI>English,</HI> as here∣tics,
abhorred of God, and detestable to all holy
<PB N="119" REF="150"/>
men, were marked out by the priests for slaughter;
and of all actions, to rid the world of these de∣clared
enemies to Catholic faith and piety, was
represented as the most meritorious. Nature,
which, in that rude people, was sufficiently in∣clined
to atrocious deeds, was farther stimulated
by precept; and national prejudices impoisoned
by those aversions, more deadly and incurable,
which arose from an enraged superstition. While
death finished the sufferings of each victim, the
bigoted assassins, with joy and exultation, still
echoed in his expiring ears, that these agonies
were but the commencement of torments infinite
and eternal.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ulster,</HI> the flames of rebellion diffused
themselves, in an instant, over the other three
provinces of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In all places, death and
slaughter were not uncommon; though the <HI>Irish,</HI>
in these other provinces, pretended to act with
more moderation and humanity: but cruel and
barbarous was their humanity! Not contented with
expelling the <HI>English</HI> their houses, with despoiling
them of their goodly manors, with wasting their
cultivated fields, they stripped them of their very
clothes, and turned them out, naked and defence∣less,
to all the severities of the season. The hea∣vens
themselves, as if conspiring against that un∣happy
people, were armed with cold and tempest,
unusual to the climate, and executed what the
merciless sword of the barbarians had left un∣finished.
<PB N="120" REF="151"/>
The roads were covered with crouds of
naked <HI>English,</HI> hastening towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the
other cities which yet remained in the hands of
their countrymen. The feeble age of children,
the tender sex of women, soon sunk under the
multiplied rigours of cold and hunger. Here, the
husband, bidding a final adieu to his expiring fa∣mily,
envied them that fate which he himself ex∣pected
so soon to share: there, the son, having
long supported his aged parent, with reluctance
obeyed his last commands, and, abandoning him
in this uttermost distress, reserved himself to the
hopes of avenging that death, which all his efforts
could not prevent nor delay. The astonishing
greatness of the calamity deprived the sufferers of
any relief from the view of companions in afflic∣tion.
With silent tears, or lamentable cries, they
hurried on through the hostile territories; and
found every heart, which was not steeled by native
barbarity, guarded by the more implacable furies
of mistaken piety and religion.</P>
<P>The saving of <HI>Dublin</HI> preserved in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
remains of the <HI>English</HI> name. The gates of that
city, though timorously opened, received the
wretched supplicants, and discovered to the view
a scene of human misery beyond what any eye had
ever before beheld. Compassion seized the amazed
inhabitants, aggravated with the fear of like cala∣mities;
while they observed the numerous foes,
without and within, which every where environed
<PB N="121" REF="152"/>
them, and reflected on the weak resources by which
they were themselves supported. The more vigo∣rous
of the unhappy fugitives, to the number of
three thousand, were inlisted into three regiments:
the rest were distributed into the houses; and all
care was taken, by diet and warmth, to recruit
their feeble and torpid limbs. Diseases of unknown
name and species, derived from these multiplied
distresses, seized many of them, and put a speedy
period to their lives: others, having no leisure to
reflect on their mighty loss of friends and fortune,
cursed that being which they had saved. Aban∣doning
themselves to despair, refusing all succour,
they expired; without other consolation, than that
of receiving among their countrymen the honours
of a grave, which to their slaughtered companions
had been denied by the inhuman barbarians.</P>

<P>ON the origin of letters among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the

<PB N="122" REF="153"/>
which, whatever rudeness may sometimes at∣tend

of nature and passion, that the compositions
possessed of it must for ever appear valuable to the
discerning part of mankind. The glaring figures
of discourse, the pointed antithesis, the unnatural
conceit, the jingle of words; such false ornaments
were not employed by early writers, not because
they were rejected, but because they scarce ever
occurred to them. An easy unforced strain of
sentiment runs through their compositions; though
at the same time, amidst the most elegant simpli∣city
of thought and expression, one is sometimes
surprised to meet with a poor conceit, which had
presented itself unsought for, and which the au∣thor
had not acquired critical observation enough
to condemn. A bad taste seizes with avidity these
frivolous beauties, and even perhaps a good taste,
ere surfeited by them. They multiply every day
more and more in the fashionable compositions:
nature and good-sense are neglected; laboured or∣naments
studied and admired; and a total degene∣racy
of style and language prepares the way for
barbarism and ignorance. Hence the <HI>Asiatic</HI> man∣ner

<P>IF <HI>Shakespear</HI> be considered as a man born in a

without any instruction, either from the world or
from books, he may be regarded as a prodigy: if
represented as a poet, capable of furnishing a pro∣per
entertainment to a refined or intelligent au∣dience,
we must abate somewhat of this eulogy.
In his compositions, we regret that many irregula∣rities,
and even sometimes absurdities, should so
frequently disfigure the animated and passionate
scenes intermixed with them; and, at the same
time, we perhaps admire the more those beauties,
on account of their being surrounded with such
deformities. A striking peculiarity of sentiment,
adapted to a singular character, he frequently hits,
as it were, by inspiration; but a reasonable pro∣priety
of thought he cannot, for any time, uphold.
Nervous and picturesque expressions, as well as de∣scriptions,
abound in him; but 'tis in vain we
look either for continued purity or simplicity of
diction. This total ignorance of all theatrical art
and conduct, however material a defect, yet, as it
affects the spectator rather than the reader, we can
more readily excuse, than that want of taste which
often prevails in his productions, and which gives
way, only by intervals, to the irradiation of ge∣nius.
A great and fertile genius he certainly pos∣sessed,
and one enriched equally with a tragic and
comic vein; but he ought to be cited as a proof,
<PB N="124" REF="155"/>

alone for the attaining an excellence in the finer

had the princes been employed in the field against
the common enemy, might have stimulated them
to martial enterprises, soon excited, during the
present leisure and repose, quarrels between mo∣narchs
of such a fiery character. Equally haughty,
ambitious, intrepid, and inflexible, they were ir∣ritated
with the least appearance of injury, and
were incapable, by mutual condescensions, to ef∣face
those causes of complaint which unavoidably
arose between them. <HI>Richard,</HI> candid, sincere,
undesigning, impolitic, violent, laid himself open,
on every occasion, to the designs of his antagonist;
who, provident, interested, deceitful, failed not to
take all advantages against him: and thus, both
the circumstances of their dispositions, in which
they were similar, and those in which they differed,
rendered it impossible for them to persevere in that
harmony which was so essential to the success of
their undertaking.</P>

<HEAD>BACON AND GALILEO.</HEAD>
<P>THE great glory of literature in this island
during the reign of <HI>James</HI> I. was my Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI>
Most of his performances were composed in <HI>Latin,</HI>
though he possessed neither the elegance of that,
nor of his native tongue. If we consider the va∣riety
of talents employed by this man, as a public
speaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a
companion, an author, a philosopher, he is justly
the object of great admiration: if we consider him
merely as an author and philosopher, the light in
which we view him at present, though very esti∣mable,
he was yet inferior to his cotemporary
<HI>Galileo,</HI> perhaps even to <HI>Kepler. Bacon</HI> pointed
out at a distance the road to true philosophy: <HI>Ga∣lileo</HI>
both pointed it out to others, and made him∣self
considerable advances in it. The <HI>Englishman</HI>
was ignorant of geometry: the <HI>Florentine</HI> revived
that science, excelled in it, and was the first who
applied it, together with experiment, to natural
philosophy. The former rejected, with the most
positive disdain, the system of <HI>Copernicus:</HI> the lat∣ter
fortified it with new proofs, derived both from
reason and the senses. <HI>Bacon</HI>'s style is stiff and
rigid: his wit, though often brilliant, is some∣times
unnatural and far-fetched; and he seems to
be the original of those pointed similes, and long∣spun
allegories, which so much distinguish the
<HI>English</HI> authors: <HI>Galileo</HI> is a lively and agreeable,
though somewhat a prolix writer; but <HI>Italy,</HI> not
<PB N="127" REF="158"/>
united in any single government, and perhaps sa∣tiated
with that literary glory which it has possessed
both in ancient and modern times, has too much
neglected the renown it has acquired by giving
birth to so great a man. That national spirit,
which prevails among the <HI>English,</HI> and which forms
their great happiness, is the cause why they bestow
on all their eminent writers, and on <HI>Bacon</HI> among
the rest, such praises and acclamations, as may
often appear partial and excessive.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>HENRY I. OF ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prince was one of the most accomplished
that has filled the <HI>English</HI> throne, and possessed all
the qualities, both of body and mind, natural and
acquired, which could sit him for the high station
to which he attained. His person was manly, his
countenance engaging, his eyes clear, serene, and
penetrating. The affability of his address encou∣raged
those who might be over-awed by the sense
of his dignity, or of his wisdom; and though he
often indulged his facetious humour, he knew how
to temper it with discretion, and ever kept at a
distance from all indecent familiarities with his
courtiers. His superior eloquence and judgment
would have given him an ascendant, even had he
been born in a private station; and his personal
bravery would have procured him respect, even
though it had been less supported by art and po∣licy.
By his great progress in literature, he ac∣quired
<PB N="128" REF="159"/>
the name of <HI>Beau-clerc,</HI> or the Scholar; but
his application to these sedentary pursuits abated
nothing of the activity and vigilance of his go∣vernment;
and though the learning of that age
was better fitted to corrupt than improve the un∣derstanding,
his natural good-sense preserved itself
untainted, both from the pedantry and superstition
which were then so prevalent among men of let∣ters.
His temper was very susceptible of the sen∣timents
as well of friendship as of resentment;
and his ambition, though high, might be esteemed
moderate and reasonable, had not his conduct to∣wards
his brother and nephew shewed that he was
too much disposed to sacrifice to it all the maxims
of justice and equity. But the total incapacity of
<HI>Robert</HI> for government afforded his younger brother
a reason or pretence for seizing the sceptre both of
<HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> and when violence and
usurpation are once begun, necessity obliges a
prince to continue in the same criminal course,
and engages him in measures which his better
judgment and sounder principles would otherwise
have induced him to reject with warmth and in∣dignation.</P>

<HEAD>MILTON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI>'s poems are admirable, though liable
to some objections; his prose writings disagreeable,
though not altogether defective in genius. Nor
are all his poems equal. His <HI>Paradise Lost,</HI> his
<HI>Comus,</HI> and a few others, shine out amidst some
<PB N="129" REF="160"/>
flat and insipid compositions. Even in the <HI>Para∣dise
Lost,</HI> his capital performance, there are very
long passages, amounting to near a third of the
work, almost wholly devoid of harmony and elo∣quence,
nay, of all vigour of imagination. The
natural inequality in <HI>Milton</HI>'s genius was much
increased by the inequalities in his subject; of
which some parts are, of themselves, the most
lofty that can enter into human conception, others
would have required the most laboured elegance
of composition to support them. It is certain,
that this author, when in an happy mood, and
employed on a noble subject, is the most wonder∣fully
sublime of any poet, in any language; <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI>
and <HI>Lucretius,</HI> and <HI>Tasso,</HI> not excepted. More
concise than <HI>Homer,</HI> more simple than <HI>Tasso,</HI> more
nervous than <HI>Lucretius;</HI> had he lived in a later age,
and learned to polish some rudeness in his verses;
had he enjoyed better fortune, and possessed leisure
to watch the returns of genius in himself; he had
attained the pinnacle of human perfection, and
borne away the palm of epic poetry.</P>
<P>It was during a state of poverty, blindness, dis∣grace,
danger, and old-age, that <HI>Milton</HI> composed
his wonderful poem, which not only surpassed all
the performances of his cotemporaries, but all
the compositions which had flowed from his pen
during the vigour of his age and the height of
his prosperity. This circumstance is not the least
remarkable of all those which attend that great
genius.</P>

<HEAD>HOBBES.</HEAD>
<P>NO author was more celebrated in his own age,
both abroad and at home, than <HI>Hobbes:</HI> in our
time he is much neglected.—A lively instance,
how precarious all reputations founded on reason∣ing
and philosophy. A pleasant comedy, which
paints the manners of the age, and exposes a faith∣ful
picture of nature, is a desirable work, and is
transmitted to the latest posterity; but a system,
whether physical or metaphysical, owes commonly
its success to its novelty, and is no sooner can∣vassed
with impartiality than its weakness is dis∣covered.
<HI>Hobbes</HI>'s politics are fitted only to pro∣mote
tyranny, and his ethics to encourage licen∣tiousness.
Though an enemy to religion, he par∣takes
nothing of the spirit of scepticism; but is
as positive and dogmatical as if human reason,
and his reason in particular, could attain a tho∣rough
conviction on these subjects. Clearness, and
propriety of style, are the chief excellencies of
<HI>Hobbes</HI>'s writings. In his own person, he is re∣presented
to have been a man of virtue; a cha∣racter
no wise surprising, notwithstanding his li∣bertine
system of ethics. Timidity is the princi∣pal
fault with which he is reproached: he lived to
an extreme old-age, yet could never reconcile
himself to the thoughts of death. The boldness
of his sentiments and opinions form a remarkable
contrast to this part of his character.</P>

epithets of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> by which, and some∣times
without any material difference, this island
has been so long divided. The court party re∣proached
their antagonists with their affinity to the
fanatical conventiclers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were known
by the name of <HI>Whigs:</HI> the country party found a
resemblance between the courtiers and the Popish
banditti in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to whom the appellation of

<P>NEW parties arose, under the appellation of
<HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> which have continued ever since
to confound and distract our government. To de∣termine
the nature of those parties, is, perhaps,
one of the most difficult problems that can be met
with, and is a proof that history may contain
questions as uncertain as any to be found in the
most abstract sciences. We have seen the conduct
of the two parties, during the course of a whole
century, in a vast variety of circumstances, pos∣sessed
of power, and deprived of it, during peace
and war: persons who profess themselves of one
<PB N="132" REF="163"/>
side or other, we meet with every hour, in com∣pany,
in our pleasures, in our serious occupations:
we ourselves are constrained, in a manner, to take
party; and being in a country of the highest li∣berty,
every one may openly declare all his senti∣ments
and opinions: yet are we at a loss to tell
the nature, pretensions, and principles, of the dif∣ferent
factions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>OF THE PARTIES OF GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>AS no party, in the present age, can well support
itself without a philosophical or speculative system
of principles, annexed to its political or practical
one; we accordingly find that each of the factions,
into which this nation is divided, has reared up a
fabric of the former kind, in order to protect and
cover that scheme of actions which it pursues.
The people being commonly very rude builders,
especially in this speculative way, and more espe∣cially
still when actuated by party zeal; it is na∣tural
to imagine, that their workmanship must be
a little unshapely, and discover evident marks of
that violence and hurry in which it was raised.
The one party, by tracing up government to the
Deity, endeavour to render it so sacred and invio∣late,
that it must be little less than sacrilege, how∣ever
tyrannical it may become, to touch or invade
it in the smallest article. The other party, by
founding government altogether on the consent of
the people, suppose, that there is a kind of ori∣ginal
<PB N="133" REF="164"/>
contract, by which the subjects have reserved
the power of resisting their sovereign, whenever
they find themselves aggrieved by that authority,
with which they have, for certain purposes, volun∣tarily
entrusted him. These are the speculative
principles of the two parties; and these, too, are
the practical consequences deduced from them.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>THE TEMPLARS MASSACRED IN
FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE order of Knights <HI>Templars</HI> had risen
during the first servour of the Crusades; and,
uniting the two qualities the most popular in that
age, devotion and valour, and exercising both in
the most popular of all enterprises, the defence of
the Holy Land, they had made rapid advances to
credit and authority, and had acquired, from the
piety of the faithful, very ample possessions in
every country in <HI>Europe,</HI> especially in <HI>France.</HI>
Their great riches, joined to the course of time,
had, by degrees, relaxed the severity of these vir∣tues;
and the <HI>Templars,</HI> in a great measure, lost
that popularity which first raised them to honour
and distinction. Acquainted, by experience, with
the fatigues and dangers of those fruitless expedi∣tions
to the East, they chose rather to enjoy in
ease their opulent revenues in <HI>Europe;</HI> and being
all of them men of birth, educated, according to
the custom of the age, without any tincture of let∣ters,
they scorned the ignoble occupations of a
<PB N="134" REF="165"/>
monastic life, and passed their time wholly in the
fashionable amusements of hunting, gallantry, and
the pleasures of the table. Their rival order, that
of St. <HI>John of Jerusalem,</HI> whose poverty had as
yet preserved them from like corruption, still di∣stinguished
themselves by their enterprises against
the infidels, and succeeded to all the popularity
which was lost by the indolence and luxury of the
<HI>Templars.</HI> But though these causes had weakened
the foundation of this order, once so celebrated
and revered, the immediate source of their destruc∣tion
proceeded from the cruel and vindictive spirit
of <HI>Philip the Fair,</HI> who, having entertained a pri∣vate
disgust against some eminent <HI>Templars,</HI> deter∣mined
to gratify at once his avidity and revenge,
by involving the whole order in one undistinguished
ruin. On no better information, than that of two
Knights, condemned by their superiors to perpe∣tual
imprisonment, for their vices and prosligacy,
he ordered, on one day, all the <HI>Templars</HI> of <HI>France</HI>
to be committed to prison, and imputed to them
such enormous and absurd crimes, as are sufficient
of themselves to destroy all the credit of the accu∣sation.
Besides their being universally charged
with murder, robbery, and vices the most shocking
to nature; every one, it was pretended, whom
they received into their order, was obliged to re∣nounce
our Saviour, to spit upon the cross, and
to join to this impiety the superstition of worship∣ping
a gilded head, which was secretly kept in
one of their houses at <HI>Marseilles.</HI> They also ini∣tiated,
<PB N="135" REF="166"/>
it was said, every candidate, by such infa∣mous
rites, as could serve to no other purpose,
than to degrade the order in his eyes, and destroy
for ever the authority of all his superiors over him.
Above an hundred of these unhappy gentlemen
were put to the torture, in order to extort from
them a confession of their guilt: the more obsti∣nate
perished in the hands of their tormentors:
several, to procure themselves immediate ease in
the violence of their agonies, acknowledged what∣ever
was required of them: forged confessions were
imputed to others: and <HI>Philip,</HI> as if their guilt
were now certain, proceeded to a confiscation of
all their treasures. But no sooner had the <HI>Templars</HI>
recovered from their tortures, than, preferring the
most cruel execution to a life with infamy, they
disavowed their confessions, exclaimed against the
forgeries, justified the innocence of their order,
and appealed to all the gallant actions performed
by them, in ancient or latter times, as a full apo∣logy
for their conduct. The barbarous tyrant,
enraged at this disappointment, and thinking him∣self
now engaged in honour to proceed to extremi∣ties,
ordered fifty-four of them, whom he branded
as relapsed heretics, to perish by the punishment
of fire, in his capital: great numbers expired after
a like manner in other parts of the kingdom: and
when he found that the perseverance of these un∣happy
victims, in justifying to the last their inno∣cence,
had made deep impression on the spectators,
he endeavoured to overcome the constancy of the
<PB N="136" REF="167"/>
<HI>Templars</HI> by new inhumanities. The Grand Mas∣ter
of the order, <HI>John de Molay,</HI> and another great
officer, brother to the sovereign of <HI>Dauphiné,</HI> were
conducted to a scaffold, erected before the church
of <HI>Notre Dame,</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> a full pardon was offered
them on the one hand: the fire, destined for their
execution, was shewn to them on the other: these
gallant nobles still persisted in the protestation of
their own innocence, and that of their order; and
were instantly hurried into the flames by the exe∣cutioner.</P>
<P>In all this barbarous injustice, <HI>Clement</HI> V. who
was the creature of <HI>Philip,</HI> and then resided in
<HI>France,</HI> fully concurred; and, without examining
a witness, or making any enquiry into the truth
of facts, he summarily, by the plenitude of his
apostolic power, abolished the whole order. The
<HI>Templars,</HI> all over <HI>Europe,</HI> were thrown into pri∣son;
their conduct underwent a strict scrutiny;
the power of their enemies still pursued and op∣pressed
them; but no where, except in <HI>France,</HI> were
the smallest traces of their guilt pretended to be
found. <HI>England</HI> sent back an ample testimony of
their piety and morals; but as the order was now
annihilated, the Knights were distributed into seve∣ral
convents, and their possessions were, by com∣mand
of the Pope, transferred to the order of St.
<HI>John.</HI></P>

<HEAD>COLONEL KIRK.</HEAD>
<P>THE following instances will give an idea of the
savage nature of Colonel <HI>Kirk,</HI> a soldier of for∣tune,
who had long served at <HI>Tangiers,</HI> and had
contracted, from his habitudes with the <HI>Moors,</HI>
an inhumanity less known in <HI>European</HI> and free
countries. At his first entry into <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> he
hanged nineteen without the least enquiry into the
merits of their cause. As if to make sport with
death, he ordered a certain number to be executed,
while he and his company should drink to the
King's health, or to the Queen's, or to Judge <HI>Jef∣feries.</HI>
Observing their feet to shake, in the ago∣nies
of death, he cried, that he would give them
music to their dancing; and he immediately com∣manded
the drums to beat, and the trumpets to
sound. By way of experiment, he ordered one
man to be hung up three times, questioning him,
at every interval, whether he repented of his
crime? But the man obstinately asserting, that,
notwithstanding all the past, he would still will∣ingly
engage in the same cause, <HI>Kirk</HI> ordered him
to be hung in chains. One story commonly told
of him, is memorable for the treachery, as well as
barbarity, which attended it. A young maid
pleaded for the life of her brother, and flung her∣self
at <HI>Kirk</HI>'s feet, armed with all the charms
which beauty and innocence, bathed in tears,
could bestow upon her. The tyrant was inflamed
with desire, not softened into love or clemency.
<PB N="138" REF="169"/>
He promised to grant her request, provided that
she, in her turn, would be equally compliant to
him. The maid yielded to the conditions: but
after she had passed the night with him, the wan∣ton
savage next morning shewed her from the win∣dow
her brother, the darling object for whom she
had sacrificed her virtue, hanged on a gibbet,
which he had secretly ordered to be there erected
for his execution. Rage, and despair, and indig∣nation,
took possession of her mind, and deprived
her for ever of her senses. All the inhabitants of
that country, innocent as well as guilty, were ex∣posed
to the ravages of this barbarian. The sol∣diery
were let loose to live on free quarter; and
his own regiment, instructed by his example, and
encouraged by his exhortations, distinguished them∣selves
in a more particular manner by their out∣rages.
By way of pleasantry, he used to denomi∣nate
them his <HI>lambs;</HI> an appellation which was
long remembered with horror in the West of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>

<HEAD>JEFFERIES.</HEAD>
<P>LADY <HI>Lisle</HI> was widow of one of the regicides,

by three <HI>Irish</HI> ruffians, who hoped to make
their fortune by this infamous piece of service.
His widow was now prosecuted for harbouring two
rebels the day after the battle of <HI>Sedgemoor;</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="170"/>
<HI>Jefferies</HI> pushed on the trial with the most unre∣lenting
violence. In vain did the aged prisoner
plead, that these criminals had been put into no
proclamation, had been convicted by no verdict,
nor could any man be denominated a traitor, till
the sentence of some legal court was passed upon
him; that it appeared not by any proof, that she
was so much as acquainted with the guilt of the
persons, or had heard of their joining the rebel∣lion
of <HI>Monmouth;</HI> that, though she might be ob∣noxious,
on account of her family, it was well
known that her heart was ever loyal, and that no
person in <HI>England</HI> had shed more tears for that fa∣tal
event, in which her husband had unfortunately
bore too great a share; and that the same princi∣ples,
which she herself had ever embraced, she had
carefully instilled into her son, and had at that
very time sent him to fight against those rebels
whom she was now accused of harbouring. Though
these arguments did not move <HI>Jefferies,</HI> they had
influence on the jury. Twice they seemed inclined
to bring in a favourable verdict: they were as often
sent back with menaces and reproaches; and at last
were constrained to give sentence against the pri∣soner.

<P>The clergy, hoping that the terrors of immediate

enemy, flocked about him, and insulted him under
his fallen fortunes. They pronounced his damna∣tion,

he was so soon to suffer, would prove but an easy
prologue to that which he must undergo hereafter.
They next offered to pray with him: but he was
too well acquainted with those forms of impreca∣tion,
<PB N="142" REF="173"/>
which they called prayers. He told them,
that they were a miserable, deluded, and deluding
people; end would shortly briny their country
under the most insupportable servitude to which
any nation had ever been reduced. "For my
part," added he, "I am much prouder to have
my head affixed to the place where it is sen∣tenced
to stand, than to have my picture hang
in the King's bed-chamber. So far from being
sorry that my legs and arms are to be sent to
four cities of the kingdom, I wish I had limbs
enough to be dispersed into all the cities of
<HI>Christendom,</HI> there to remain as testimonies in
favour of the cause for which I suffer." This
sentiment, that very evening, while in prison, he
threw into verse. The poem remains; a signal

ignominious death destined to the meanest male∣factor.
Every attempt which the insolence of the

yet one effort more in this last and melancholy
scene, when all enmity, arising from motives merely

executioner brought that book, which had been
published in elegant <HI>Latin,</HI> of his truly heroic

<HI>Montrose</HI> smiled at this new instance of their malice.
He thanked them, however, for their officious
zeal, and said, that he bore this testimony of his

to overturn. Death too, which with such
signal intrepidity he had braved in the field, be∣ing
incessantly threatened by the poniards of fana∣tical
or interested assassins, was ever present to his
terrified apprehensions, and haunted him in every
scene of business or repose. Each action of his
life betrayed the terrors under which he laboured.
The aspect of strangers was uneasy to him. With
a piercing and anxious eye he surveyed every face
to which he was not daily accustomed. He never
moved a step without strong guards attending him:
he wore armour under his clothes, and farther se∣cured
himself by offensive weapons, a sword, fal∣chion,
and pistols, which he always carried about
him. He returned from no place by the direct
<PB N="145" REF="176"/>
road, or by the same way which he went. Every
journey he performed with hurry and precipi∣tation.
Seldom he slept above three nights in
the same chamber: and he never let it be known
before-hand what chamber he intended to choose,
nor entrusted himself in any which was not pro∣vided
with back-doors, at which centinels were
carefully placed. Society terrified him, while he
reflected on his numerous, unknown, implacable
enemies: solitude astonished him, by withdrawing
that protection which he found so necessary for his
security.</P>

<HEAD>THE SACK OF ROME BY THE GERMANS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FRANCIS</HI> was extremely desirous that the

these hopes, he was the more remiss in

out every moment, and which their affection for
him had hitherto restrained, he led them to <HI>Rome,</HI>
and promised to enrich them by the plunder of
that opulent city. He was himself killed, as he
was planting a ladder to scale the walls; but his
soldiers, rather enraged than discouraged by his
death, mounted to the assault by the utmost valour,
and, entering the city sword in hand, exercised all
those brutalities which may be expected from fero∣city
excited by resistance, and insolence which
takes place when that resistance is no more. This
renowned city, exposed, by her renown alone, to
so many calamities, never endured in any age,
even from the barbarians by whom she was often
subdued, such indignities as she was now con∣strained
to suffer. The unrestrained massacre and
pillage, which continued for several days, were
the least ills to which the unhappy <HI>Romans</HI> were
exposed. Whatever was respectable in modesty,
or sacred in religion, seemed but the more to pro∣voke
the insults of the soldiery. Virgins suffered
violation in the arms of their parents, and upon
those very altars to which they had fled for pro∣tection.
Aged prelates, after enduring every in∣dignity,
and even every torture, were thrown into
dungeons, and menaced each moment with the
most cruel death, in order to engage them to re∣veal
their secret treasures, or purchase liberty by
exorbitant ransoms. <HI>Clement</HI> himself, who had
trusted for protection to the sacredness of his cha∣racter,
and neglected to make his escape in time,
<PB N="147" REF="180"/>
was taken captive, and found that his dignity,
which procured him no regard from the <HI>Spanish</HI>
soldiers, did but draw on him the insolent mock∣ery
of the <HI>German,</HI> who, being generally attached

<HEAD>IMPUDENCE AND MODESTY,
AN ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JUPITER,</HI> in the beginning, joined Virtue,
Wisdom, and Confidence together; and Vice,
Folly, and Diffidence: and in that society set
them upon the earth. But though he thought he
had matched them with great judgment, and said
that Confidence was the natural companion of
Virtue, and that Vice deserved to be attended
with Diffidence, they had not gone far before dis∣sension
arose among them. Wisdom, who was
the guide of the one company, was always accus∣tomed,
before she ventured upon any road, how∣ever
beaten, to examine it carefully, to enquire
whither it led, what dangers, difficulties, and hin∣drances
might possibly or probably occur in it.
In these deliberations she usually consumed some
time; which delay was very displeasing to Confi∣dence,
who was always inclined to hurry on, with∣out
much forethought or deliberation, in the first
road he met. Wisdom and Virtue were insepara∣ble;
but Confidence one day, following his impe∣tuous
<PB N="148" REF="181"/>
nature, advanced a considerable way before
his guides and companions; and, not feeling any
want of their company, he never enquired after
them, nor ever met with them more. In like
manner, the other society, though joined by <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI>
disagreed and separated. As Folly saw very
little way before her, she had nothing to de∣termine
concerning the goodness of roads, nor
could give the preference to one above another;
and this want of resolution was increased by Diffi∣dence,
who, with her doubts and scruples, always
retarded the journey. This was a great annoy∣ance
to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties
and delays, and was never satisfied without his full
career, in whatever his inclinations led him to.
Folly, he knew, though she hearkened to Diffi∣dence,
would be easily managed when alone; and
therefore, as a vicious horse throws his rider, he
openly beat away this controller of all his plea∣sures,
and proceeded in his journey with Folly,
from whom he is inseparable. Confidence and
Diffidence being, after this manner, both thrown
loose from their respective companies, wandered
for some time, till at last chance led them at the
same time to one village. Confidence went di∣rectly
up to the great house, which belonged to
Wealth, the lord of the village; and, without
staying for a porter, intruded himself immediately
into the innermost apartments, where he found
Vice and Folly well received before him. He
joined the train, recommended himself very quick∣ly
<PB N="149" REF="182"/>
to his landlord, and entered into such familia∣rity
with Vice, that he was enlisted in the same
company along with Folly. They were frequent
guests of Wealth, and from that moment insepa∣rable.
Diffidence, in the mean time, not daring
to approach the great house, accepted of an invi∣tation
from Poverty, one of the tenants; and, en∣tering
the cottage, found Wisdom and Virtue,
who, being repulsed by the landlord, had retired
thither. Virtue took compassion of her, and Wis∣dom
found, from her temper, that she would ea∣sily
improve: so they admitted her into their so∣ciety.
Accordingly, by their means, she altered
in a little time somewhat of her manner, and be∣coming
much more amiable and engaging, was
now called by the name of Modesty. As ill com∣pany
has a greater effect than good, Confidence,
though more refractory to counsel and example,
degenerated so far by the society of Vice and Fol∣ly,
as to pass by the name of Impudence. Man∣kind,
who saw these societies as <HI>Jupiter</HI> first joined
them, and know nothing of these mutual deser∣tions,
are led into strange mistakes by those,
means, and wherever they see Impudence, make
account of Virtue and Wisdom, and wherever
they observe Modesty call her attendants Vice

<HEAD>OF THE STUDY OF HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing I would recommend more
earnestly to my female readers than the Study of
History, as an occupation, of all others, the best
suited both to their sex and education; much more
instructive than their ordinary books of amuse∣ment,
and more entertaining than those serious
compositions which are usually to be found in
their closets. Among other important truths,
which they may learn from history, they may be
informed of two particulars, the knowledge of
which may contribute very much to their quiet
and repose; That our sex, as well as theirs, are
far from being such perfect creatures as they are
apt to imagine; and, That Love is not the only
passion that governs the male world, but is often
overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity, and a
thousand other passions. Whether they be the
false representations of mankind in those two par∣ticulars
that endear romances and novels so much
so the fair sex, I know not; but must confess, I
am sorry to see them have such an aversion to
matter of fact, and such an appetite for falsehood.
I remember I was once desired by a young beauty,
for whom I had some passion, to send her some
novels and romances for her amusement in the
country; but was not so ungenerous as to take
the advantage which such a course of reading
might have given me, being resolved not to make
<PB N="151" REF="184"/>
use of poisoned arms against her. I therefore sent
her <HI>Plutarch</HI>'s Lives, assuring her, at the same
time, that there was not a word of truth in them
from beginning to end. She perused them very
attentively till she came to the Lives of <HI>Alexander</HI>
and <HI>Caesar,</HI> whose names she had heard of by acci∣dent;
and then returned me the book, with many,
reproaches for deceiving her.</P>
<P>I may indeed be told, that the fair sex have no
such aversion to history as I have represented, pro∣vided
it be <HI>secret</HI> history, and contain some memo∣rable
transaction proper to excite their curiosity.
But as I do not find that truth, which is the basis
of history, is at all regarded in those anecdotes,
I cannot admit of this as a proof of their passion
for that study. However this may be, I see not
why the same curiosity might not receive a more
proper direction, and lead them to desire accounts
of those who lived in past ages, as well as of their
contemporaries. What is it to <HI>Cleora,</HI> whether
<HI>Fulvia</HI> entertains a secret commerce of love with
<HI>Philander</HI> or not? Has she not equal reason to be
pleased, when she is informed, (what is whispered
about among historians) that <HI>Cato</HI>'s sister had an
intrigue with <HI>Caesar,</HI> and palmed her son, <HI>Marcus
Brutus,</HI> upon her husband for his own, though in
reality he was her gallant's? And are not the
loves of <HI>Messalina</HI> or <HI>Julia</HI> as proper subjects of
discourse as any intrigue that this city has pro∣duced
of late years?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="185"/>
But I know not whence it comes that I have
been thus seduced into a kind of raillery against
the ladies; unless, perhaps, it proceed from the
same cause that makes the person who is the fa∣vourite
of the company, be often the object of
their good-natured jests and pleasantries. We are
pleased to address ourselves after any manner to a
person that is agreeable to us; and, at the same
time, presume that nothing will be taken amiss by
one who is secure of the good opinion and affec∣tions
of every one present. I shall now proceed to
handle my subject more seriously, and shall point
out the many advantages that flow from the Study
of History, and show how well suited it is to every
one, but particularly to those who are debarred
the severer studies, by the tenderness of their com∣plexion,
and the weakness of their education.
The advantages found in history seem to be of
three kinds, as it amuses the fancy, as it improves
the understanding, and as it strengthens virtue.</P>
<P>In reality, what more agreeable entertainment to
the mind, than to be transported into the remotest
ages of the world, and to observe human society,
in its infancy, making the first faint essays towards
the arts and sciences? To see the policy of go∣vernment
and the civility of conversation ref<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning
by degrees, and every thing that is ornamental to
human life advancing towards its perfection? To
mark the rise, progress, declension, and final ex∣tinction
of the most flourishing empires; the vir∣tues
<PB N="153" REF="186"/>
which contributed to their greatness, and the
vices which drew on their ruin? In short, to see
all human race, from the beginning of time, pass,
as it were, in review before us, appearing in their
true colours, without any of those disguises which,
during their life-time, so much perplexed the
judgments of the beholders? What spectacle can
be imagined so magnificent, so various, so inte∣resting?
What amusement, either of the senses or
imagination, can be compared with it? Shall
those trifling pastimes, which engross so much of
our time, be preferred as more satisfactory, and
more sit to engage our attention? How perverse
must that taste be, which is capable of so wrong a
choice of pleasures!</P>
<P>But history is a most improving part of know∣ledge,
as well as an agreeable amusement; and in∣deed
a great part of what we commonly call <HI>eru∣dition,</HI>
and value so highly, is nothing but an
acquaintance with historical facts. An extensive
knowledge of this kind belongs to Men of Let∣ters;
but I must think it an unpardonable igno∣rance
in persons, of whatever sex or condition, not
to be acquainted with the history of their own
country along with the histories of ancient <HI>Greece</HI>
and <HI>Rome.</HI> A woman may behave herself with
good-manners, and have even some vivacity in her
turn of wit; but, where her mind is so unfurnish∣ed,
'tis impossible her conversation can afford any
entertainment to men of sense and reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="187"/>
I must add, that history is not only a valuable
part of knowledge, but opens the door to many
other parts of knowledge, and affords materials
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the sciences. And indeed, if we con∣sider
the shortness of human life, and our limited
knowledge, even of what passes in our own time,
we must be sensible that we should be for ever chil∣dren
in understanding, were it not for this inven∣tion,
which extends our experience to all past ages,
and to the most distant nations; making them con∣tribute
as much to our improvement in wisdom as
if they had actually lain under our observation.
A man acquainted with history may, in some re∣spect,
be said to have lived from the beginning of
the world, and to have been making continual ad∣ditions
to his stock of knowledge in every cen∣tury.</P>
<P>There is also an advantage in that knowledge
which is acquired by history, above what is learn∣ed
by the practice of the world, that it brings us
acquainted with human affairs, without diminish∣ing
in the least from the most delicate senti∣ments
of virtue. And, to tell the truth, I know
not any study or occupation so unexceptionable as
history in this particular. Poets can paint virtue
in the most charming colours; but, as they address
themselves entirely to the passions, they often be∣come
advocates for vice. Even philosophers are
apt to bewilder themselves in the subtilty of their
speculations; and we have seen some go so far as
<PB N="155" REF="188"/>
to deny the reality of all moral distinctions. But
I think it a remark worthy the attention of the
speculative reader, that the historians have been,
almost without exception, the true friends of vir∣tue,
and have always represented it in its proper
colours, however they may have erred in their
judgments of particular persons. <HI>Machiavel</HI> him∣self
discovers a true sentiment of virtue in his His∣tory
of <HI>Florence.</HI> When he talks as a politician,
in his general reasonings, he considers poisoning,
assassination, and perjury, as lawful arts of power;
but when he speaks as an historian, in his particu∣lar
narrations, he shows so keen an indignation
against vice, and so warm an approbation of vir∣tue,
in many passages, that I could not forbear
applying to him that remark of <HI>Horace,</HI> That if
you chase away nature, though with never so great
indignity, she will always return upon you. Nor
is this combination of historians in favour of virtue
at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man
of business enters into life and action, he is more
apt to consider the characters of men as they have
relation to his interest than as they stand in them∣selves,
and has his judgment warped on every oc∣casion
by the violence of his passion. When a
philosopher contemplates characters and manners
in his closet, the general abstract view of the ob∣jects
leaves the mind so cold und unmoved that the
sentiments of nature have no room to play, and he
scarce feels the difference betwixt vice and virtue.
History keeps in a just medium betwixt these ex∣tremes,
<PB N="156" REF="189"/>
and places the objects in their true point
of view. The writers of history, as well as the
readers, are sufficiently interested in the characters
and events, to have a lively sentiment of blame or
praise; and, at the same time, have no particular
interest or concern to pervert their judgment.</P>

<P>OUR old mother Earth once laid an indictment
against Avarice before the courts of heaven, for
her wicked and malicious counsel and advice, in
tempting, inducing, persuading, and traiterously
seducing the children of the plaintiff to commit
the detestable crime of parricide upon her, and,
mangling her body, ransack her very bowels for
hidden treasure. The indictment was very long
and verbose; but we must omit a great part of
the repetitions and synonymous terms, not to tire
our reader too much with our tale. Avarice, be∣ing
called before <HI>Jupiter</HI> to answer to this charge,
had not much to say in her own defence. The
injury was clearly proved upon her. The fact,
indeed, was notorious, and the injury had been
frequently repeated. When therefore the plain∣tiff
demanded justice, <HI>Jupiter</HI> very readily gave
sentence in her favour; and his decree was to this
purpose, That since Dame Avarice, the defen∣dant,
had thus grievously injured Dame Earth,
the plaintiff, she was hereby ordered to take that
treasure of which she had feloniously robbed the
said plaintiff by ransacking her bosom, and in the
same manner as before, opening her bosom, re∣store
it back to her, without diminution or reten∣tion.
From this sentence, it shall follow, says
<HI>Jupiter</HI> to the by-standers, that, in all future ages,
the retainers of Avarice shall bury and conceal
their riches, and thereby restore to the Earth what
they took from her.</P>

<HEAD>LOVE AND MARRIAGE. AN ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND were not, as at present, originally
divided into male and female; but each individual
was a compound of both sexes, and was in himself
both Husband and Wife, melted down into one
living creature. This union was doubtless very
entire, and the parts well adjusted together, since
there subsisted the most perfect harmony between
male and female, though obliged to continue in∣separable
companions. But so great was the hap∣piness
flowing from this union, that the <HI>men-women</HI>
became insolent on their prosperity, and rebelled
against the gods. To punish them for this teme∣rity,
<HI>Jupiter</HI> could contrive no better expedient,
than to divorce the male part from the female,
and make two imperfect beings of the compound,
which was before so perfect. Hence the origin of
men and women, as distinct creatures. But, not∣withstanding
our division, so lively is our remem∣brance
of the happiness enjoyed in our primaeval
state, that we are never at rest in the present. Each
of these halves is continually searching through
the whole species to find the other half, which
was broken from it: and when they meet, they
join again with the greatest fondness and sympathy.
But it often happens, that they are mistaken in
this particular; that they take for their half what
no way corresponds to them; and that the parts
do not meet nor join in with each other, as is usual
<PB N="159" REF="192"/>
with fractures. In this case, the union is soon,
dissolved, and each part is set loose again, to hunt
for its lost half; joining itself to every one it meets,
by way of trial, and enjoying no rest, till its per∣fect
sympathy with its partner shews that it has at
last been successful in its endeavours.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jupiter</HI> had separated the male from the
female, and had quelled their pride and ambition
by so severe an operation, he could not but repent
him of the cruelty of his vengeance, and take
compassion on poor mortals, who were now become
incapable of any repose or tranquillity. Such
cravings, such anxieties, such necessities, arose,
as made them curse their creation, and think ex∣istence
itself a punishment. In vain had they re∣course
to every other occupation and amusement.
In vain did they seek after every pleasure of sense,
and every refinement of reason. Nothing could
fill that void, which they felt in their hearts, or
supply the loss of their partner, who was so fatally
separated from them. To remedy this disorder,
and to bestow some comfort, at least, on human
race in their forlorn situation, <HI>Jupiter</HI> sent down
<HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hymen</HI> to collect the broken halves of
human kind, and piece them together, in the best
manner possible. These two deities found such a
prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in
their primitive state, that they proceeded on their
work with wonderful success for some time; till at
last, from many unlucky accidents, dissension arose
<PB N="160" REF="193"/>
betwixt them. The chief counsellor and favourite
of <HI>Hymen</HI> was <HI>Care,</HI> who was continually filling his
patron's head with prospects of futurity; a settle∣ment,
family, children, servants; so that little else
was regarded in all the matches <HI>they</HI> made. On
the other hand, <HI>Love</HI> had chosen <HI>Pleasure</HI> for his
favourite, who was as pernicious a counsellor as
the other, and would never allow <HI>Love</HI> to look be∣yond
the present momentary gratification, or the
satisfying of the prevailing inclination. These
two favourites became, in a little time, irrecon∣cileable
enemies, and made it their chief business
to undermine each other in all their undertakings.
No sooner had <HI>Love</HI> fixed upon two halves, which
he was cementing together, and forming to a close
union, but <HI>Care</HI> insinuates himself, and, bringing
<HI>Hymen</HI> along with him, dissolves the union pro∣duced
by <HI>Love,</HI> and joins each half to some other
half, which he had provided for it. To be re∣venged
of this, <HI>Pleasure</HI> creeps in upon a pair al∣ready
joined by <HI>Hymen;</HI> and calling <HI>Love</HI> to his
assistance, they under-hand contrive to join each
half, by secret links, to halves which <HI>Hymen</HI> was
wholly unacquainted with. It was not long before
this quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences;
arid such complaints arose before the throne of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> that he was obliged to summon the offend∣ing
parties to appear before him, in order to give
an account of their proceedings. After hearing
the pleadings on both sides, he ordered an imme∣diate
reconcilement betwixt <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hymen,</HI> as the
<PB N="161" REF="194"/>
only expedient for giving happiness to mankind:
and that he might be sure this reconcilement should
be durable, he laid his strict injunctions on them,
never to join any halves without consulting their
favourites, <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and obtaining the
consent of both to the conjunction. Where this
order is strictly observed, the <HI>Androgyne</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Man-Woman,</NOTE> is perfectly
restored, and human race enjoy the same happiness
as in their primaeval state. The seam is scarce
perceived that joins the two beings together; but
both of them combine to form one perfect and
happy creature.</P>

<HEAD>A CURIOUS LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>Aug. 2, 1737.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I KNOW you are more curious of
accounts of men than of buildings, and are more
desirous of being informed of private history than
of public transactions; for which reason, I thought
the following story, which is the common topic of
conversation in this city, would be no unacceptable
entertainment to you.</P>
<P>A young lady of birth and fortune, being left
entirely at her own disposal, persisted long in a re∣solution
of leading a single life, notwithstanding
several advantageous offers that had been made to
her. She had been determined to embrace this
resolution, by observing the many unhappy mar∣riages
<PB N="162" REF="195"/>
among her acquaintance, and by hearing
the complaints which her female friends made of
the tyranny, inconstancy, jealousy, or indifference
of their husbands. Being a woman of strong spi∣rit,
and an uncommon way of thinking, she found
no difficulty either in forming or maintaining this
resolution, and could not suspect herself of such
weakness, as ever to be induced, by any tempta∣tion,
to depart from it. She had, however, en∣tertained
a strong desire of having a son, whose
education she was resolved to make the principal
concern of her life, and by that means supply the
place of those other passions, which she was re∣solved
for ever to renounce. She pushed her phi∣losophy
to such an uncommon length, as to find
no contradiction betwixt such a desire and her
former resolution; and accordingly looked about,
with great deliberation, to find, among all her
male acquaintance, one whose character and per∣son
were agreeable to her, without being able to
satisfy herself on that head. At length, being in
the play-house one evening, she sees, in the <HI>par∣terre,</HI>
a young man of a most engaging countenance
and modest deportment; and feels such a pre-pos∣session
in his favour, that she had hopes this must
be the person she had long sought for in vain. She
immediately dispatches a servant to him; desiring
his company, at her lodgings, next morning. The
young man was over-joyed at the message, and
could not command his satisfaction, upon receiv∣ing
such an advance from a lady of so great beau∣ty,
<PB N="163" REF="196"/>
reputation, and quality. He was, therefore,
much disappointed, when he found a woman who
would allow him no freedoms, and, amidst all her
obliging behaviour, confined and over-awed him
to the bounds of rational discourse and conversa∣tion.
She seemed, however, willing to commence
a friendship with him; and told him, that his
company would always be acceptable to her, when∣ever
he had a leisure hour to bestow. He needed
not much intreaty to renew his visits; being so
struck with her wit and beauty, that he must have
been unhappy, had he been debarred her company.
Every conversation served only the more to inflame
his passion, and gave him more occasion to admire
her person and understanding, as well as to rejoice
in his own good fortune. He was not, however,
without anxiety, when he considered the dispro∣portion
of their birth and fortune; nor was his
uneasiness allayed, even when he reflected on the
extraordinary manner in which their acquaintance
had commenced. Our philosophical heroine, in
the mean time, discovered that her lover's perso∣nal
qualities did not belie his physiognomy; so
that, judging there was no occasion for any farther
trial, she takes a proper opportunity of communi∣cating
to him her whole intention. Their inter∣course
continued for some time, till at last her
wishes were crowned, and she was now mother of
a boy, who was to be the object of her future care
and concern. Gladly would she have continued
her friendship with the father; but finding him
<PB N="164" REF="197"/>
too passionate a lover to remain within the bounds

will be adopted by future historians.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Walpole,</HI> Prime Minister of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
is a man of ability, not a genius; good-natured,
not virtuous; constant, not magnani∣mous;
moderate, not equitable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moderate in the exercise of power, not equitable in engrossing it.</NOTE>. His virtues, in
some instances, are free from the allay of those
vices which usually accompany such virtues: he is
a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy.
His vices, in other instances, are not compensated
by those virtues which are nearly allied to them:
his want of enterprise is not attended with fruga∣lity.
The private character of the man is better
than the public; his virtues more than his vices;
his fortune greater than his fame. With many
good qualities, he has incurred the public hatred:
with good capacity, he has not escaped ridicule.
He would have been esteemed more worthy of his
high station, had he never possessed it; and is bet∣ter
qualified for the second than for the first place
in any government. His ministry has been more
advantageous to his family than to the public,
better for this age than for posterity, and more
pernicious by bad precedents than by real griev∣ances.
During his time, trade has flourished,
liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I
<PB N="167" REF="200"/>
am a man, I love him; as I am a scholar, I hate
him; as I am a <HI>Briton,</HI> I calmly wish his fall.
And were I a Member of either House, I would
give my vote for removing him from St. <HI>James</HI>'s;
but should be glad to see him retire to <HI>Houghton-Hall,</HI>
to pass the remainder of his days in ease

<HEAD>KNOWLEDGE OF CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more useful, nothing more ne∣cessary,

only that natural private sagacity, which is con∣versant
about individuals, and enables some men
to pry, as it were, into the heads and hearts of
others, and to discover within them those latent
principles which constitute their true characters,
and are often disguised in outward action; but I
mean, principally, that acquired, public, political
sagacity, which is of the same kind, though I think
not altogether the same thing, as the former;
which flows from nature too, but requires more to
be assisted by experience, and formed by art. This
is that superior talent of Ministers of State, which
is so rarely found in those of other countries, and
which abounds so happily, at present, in those of
<HI>Great-Britain.</HI> It is by this, that they discover
the most secret dispositions of other courts, and,
discovering those dispositions, prevent their de∣signs,

them. It is by this, that they watch over the

every event that happens, and, much more, every

is of indispensible necessity in free countries, where
a greater regard is to be constantly had to the va∣rious
fluctuations of parties; to the temper, hu∣mour,

Without such a regard as this, those combinations
of peculiar circumstances, which we commonly call

<HEAD>A COALITION OF PARTIES AT THE

<P>MANY of the most distinguished Tories, some

and the whole nation was ripe for, the Revolution.
The Whigs were zealous in the same cause; but
their zeal was not such as, I think, it had been
some years before, a zeal without knowledge; I
mean, that it was better tempered, and more pru∣dently
conducted. Though the King was not the
better for his experience, parties were. Both saw
their errors. The Tories stopped short in the pur∣suit
of a bad principle. The Whigs reformed the
abuse of a good one. Both had sacrificed their
country to their party. Both sacrificed, on this
occasion, their party to their country. When the
Tories and the Whigs were thus coalited, the lat∣ter
stood no longer in need of any adventitious
help. If they did not refuse the assistance of those
who had weakened their cause more by the jealou∣sies
and fears, to which they gave both occasion
and pretence, than they had strengthened it by
their numbers, yet they suffered them to have no
influence in their counsels, no direction of their
conduct. The cause of liberty was no longer made
<PB N="179" REF="211"/>
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a party, by being set on such a bot∣tom
and pushed in such a manner, as one party
alone approved. The Revolution was plainly de∣signed
to restore and secure our government, eccle∣siastical
and civil, on true foundations; and what∣ever
may happen to the King, there was no room
to expect any change of the constitution. There
were some, indeed, concerned in this great and
glorious undertaking, who had obstinately pre∣served
or lightly taken up, the republican and
other whimsies, that reigned in the days of usur∣pation
and confusion. If they could have pre∣vailed,
and it was no fault of theirs they did not,
the coalition of parties had been broken; and in∣stead
of a revolution we might have had a civil
war; perhaps not even that sad chance for our re∣ligion
and liberty. But this leaven was so near
worn out, that it could neither corrupt, nor seem
any longer to corrupt, the mass of the Whig
party. The party never had been Presbyterians,
nor Republicans, any more than they had been
Quakers; any more than the Tory party had been
Papists, when, notwithstanding their aversion to
Popery, they were undeniably under the accidental
influence of Popish councils. But even the ap∣pearances
were now rectified. The Revolution
was a fire which purged off the dross of both par∣ties;

<HEAD>THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT ON
THE SPIRIT OF NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>AS the natural dispositions of men are altered,
and formed into different moral characters, by
education, so the spirit of a constitution of go∣vernment,
which is confirmed, improved, and
strengthened, by the course of events, and espe∣cially
by those of fruitless opposition, in a long
tract of time, will have a proportionable influence
on the reasoning, the sentiments, and the conduct,
of those who are subject to it. A different spirit,
and contrary prejudices, may prevail for a time;
but the spirit and principles of the constitution
will prevail at last. If one be unnatural, and the
other absurd, and that is the case of many govern∣ments,
a vigorous exercise of power, signal re∣wards,
signal punishments, and variety of other
secondary means, which in such constitutions are
never wanting, will however maintain, as long as
they are employed, both the spirit and the princi∣ples.
But if the spirit and principles of a consti∣tion
be agreeable to nature, and the true ends of
government, which is the case of the present con∣stitution
of the <HI>British</HI> government, they want no
such means to make them prevail. They not only
flourish without them, but they would fade and
die away with them. As liberty is nourished and
supported by such a spirit and such principles, so
they are propagated by liberty. Truth and reason

are often able to get the better of authority in
particular minds; but truth and reason, with au∣thority
on their side, will carry numbers, bear
down prejudices, and become the very genius of a
people. The progress they make is always sure,
but sometimes not observable by every eye. Con∣trary
prejudices may seem to maintain themselves
in vigour, and these prejudices may be kept up
long by passion and by artifice; but when truth
and reason continue to act without restraint, a lit∣tle
sooner, or a little later, and often when this turn
is least expected, the prejudices vanish at once,

DISTINGUISHED.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be asked, perhaps, how men who are
friends to a government, can be enemies, at the
same time, to the constitution on which that go∣vernment
is founded? But the answer will be easy,
if we consider these two things; first, the true di∣stinction,
so often confounded in writing, and al∣most
always in conversation, between Constitution
and Government. By Constitution we mean, when∣ever
we speak with propriety and exactness, the
assemblage of laws, institutions, and customs, de∣rived
from certain fixed principles of reason di∣rected
to certain fixed objects of public good, that
compose the general system, according to which
the community hath agreed to be governed. By
Government we mean, whenever we speak in the
same manner, that particular tenor of conduct,
which a chief magistrate, and inferior magistrates
under his direction and influence, hold in the ad∣ministration
of public affairs. We call this a Good
Government, when the execution of the laws, the
<PB N="183" REF="215"/>
observation of the institutions and customs, in
short, the whole administration of public affairs,
is wisely pursued, and with a strict conformity to
the principles and objects of the constitution. We
call it a Bad Government, when it is administered
on other principles, and directed to other objects,
either wickedly or weakly, either by obtaining
new laws which want this conformity, or by per∣verting
old ones which had it; and when this is
done without law, or in open violation of the
laws, we term it a Tyrannical Government. In a
word, and to bring this home to our own case,
Constitution is the rule by which our Princes ought
to govern at all times; Government is that by
which they actually do govern at any particular
time. One may remain immutable; the other may,
and, as human nature is constituted, must vary.
One is the criterion by which we are to try the
other; for, surely, we have a right to do so; since,
if we are to live in subjection to the government
of our Kings, our Kings are to govern in subjec∣tion
to the constitution; and the conformity or
non-conformity of their government to it, prescribes
the measure of our submission to them, according
to the principles of the Revolution, and of our
present settlement: in both of which, though some
remote regard war had to blood, yet the preserva∣tion
of the constitution manifestly determined the
community to the choice then made of the persons
who should govern.</P>

<HEAD>HOW LIBERTY MAY BE LOST.</HEAD>
<P>WE do not read, I think, of more than one
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Cappadocians. Vide Strabo, lib. xii.</NOTE> nation who refused liberty when it was offered to
them; but we read of many, and have almost seen
some, who lost it through their own fault, by the
plain and necessary consequences of their own con∣duct,
when they were in full possession of it, and
had the means of securing it effectually in their
own power. A wise and brave people will neither
<PB N="187" REF="219"/>
be cozened nor bullied out of their liberty: but a
wise and brave people may cease to be such; they
may degenerate, they may sink into sloth and luxu∣ry;
they may resign themselves to a treacherous
conduct, or abet the enemies of the constitution,
under a notion of supporting the friends of the
government; they may want the sense to discern
their danger in time, or the courage to resist when
it stares them in the face.</P>
<P>As all government began, so all government
must end, with the people; tyrannical governments
by their virtue and courage, and even free govern∣ments
by their vice and baseness. Our constitution,
indeed, makes it impossible to destroy liberty by
any sudden blast of popular fury, or by the trea∣chery
of a few; for, though the many cannot hurt,
they may easily save themselves: but, if the many
will concur with the few, if they will advisedly
and deliberately suffer their liberty to be taken
away by those to whom they delegate power to
preserve it, this no constitution can prevent. God
could not even support his own theocracy against
the concurrent desire of the children of <HI>Israel,</HI> but
gave them a King in his anger: how then could
our human constitution support itself against this
universal change in the temper and character of
our people? It cannot be. We may give ourselves
a tyrant in our folly, if we please: but this can
never happen till the whole nation falls into a state
of political reprobation Then, and not till then,
political damnation will be our lot.</P>

If the people of this island should suffer their
liberties to be at any time ravished or stolen from
them, they would incur greater blame, and deserve,
by consequence, less pity, than any enslaved and
oppressed people ever did. By how much true li∣berty
had been more boldly asserted, more wisely
or more successfully improved, and more firmly
established, in this than in other countries, by so
much the more heavy would our just condemnation
prove in the case that is here supposed. The vir∣tue
of our ancestors, to whom all these advantages
are owing, would aggravate the guilt and the in∣famy
of their degenerate posterity. There have
been ages of gold, and of silver, of brass, and of
iron, in our little world, as in the great world,
though not in the same order. In which of these
ages we are at present, let others determine. This,
at least, is certain, that, in all these ages, <HI>Britain</HI>
hath been the temple, as it were, of Liberty.
Whilst her sacred fires have been extinguished in
so many countries, here they have been religiously
kept alive. Here she hath her saints, her confes∣sors,
and a whole army of martyrs; and the gates
of hell have not hitherto prevailed against her:
so that, if a fatal reverse is to happen, if servility
and servitude are to over-run the whole world,
like injustice, and liberty is to retire from it, like
<HI>Astraea,</HI> our portion of the abandoned globe will
have at least the mournful honour, whenever it
happens, of shewing her last, her parting steps.</P>

Some nations have received the yoke of servitude
with little or no struggle; but, if ever it is imposed
upon us, we must not only hold out our necks to
receive it, we must help to put it on. Now, to
be passive in such a case, is shameful; but to be
active, is supreme and unexampled infamy. In
order to become slaves, we of this nation must be,
before-hand, what other people have been rendered
by a long course of servitude; we must become the
most corrupt, most profligate, the most senseless,
the most servile nation of wretches that ever dis∣graced
humanity; for a force sufficient to ravish
liberty from us, such as a great standing army is
in time of peace, cannot be continued unless we
continue it; nor can the means necessary to steal
liberty from us be long enough employed with ef∣fect,
unless we give a sanction to their iniquity

<HEAD>THE COURT OF A GOOD KING
REFORMED.</HEAD>
<P>HIS first care will, no doubt, be to purge his
court. The men in power will be some of those
adventurers, busy and bold, who thrust and crowd
themselves early into the intrigue of party, and
the management of affairs of state, often without
true ability, always without true ambition, or even
the appearance of virtue; who mean nothing more
than what is called making a fortune, the acquisi∣tion
of wealth to satisfy <HI>avarice,</HI> and of titles and
ribbands to satisfy vanity. Such as these are sure
to be employed by a weak or a wicked King.
They impose on the first, and are chosen by the
last. Nor is it marvellous that they are so; since
every other want is supplied in them by the want
of good principles and a good conscience; and
since these defects become ministerial perfections,
in a reign when measures are pursued, and designs
carried on, that every honest man will disapprove.
All the prostitutes who set themselves to sale, all
the locusts who devour the land, with crowds of
spies, parasites, and sycophants, will surround the
throne under the patronage of such ministers; and
whole swarms of little noisome, nameless infects
will hum and buzz in every corner of the court.
Such ministers will be cast off, and such abettors
<PB N="198" REF="230"/>
of ministry will be chaced away together, and at
once, by a <HI>patriot King.</HI> Some of them, perhaps,
will be abandoned by him, not to party fury, but
to national justice; not to sate private resentments,
and to serve particular interests, but to make satis∣faction
for wrongs done to their country, and to
stand as examples of terror to future administra∣tions.
Clemency makes, no doubt, an amiable
part of the character I attempt to draw; but cle∣mency,

<HEAD>WISDOM AND CUNNING DIS∣TINGUISHED.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> says, that <HI>cunning is left-handed

a part, but the lowest part, of wisdom; employed
alone by some, because they have not the other
parts to employ; and by some, because it is as
much as they want within those bounds of action
which they prescribe to themselves, and sufficient
to the ends that they propose. The difference
seems to consist in degree and application, rather
than in kind. Wisdom is neither <HI>left-handed</HI> nor
<HI>crooked:</HI> but the heads of some men contain little,
and the hearts of others employ it wrong. To
use my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s own comparison, the cunning
man knows how to pack the cards, the wise man
how to play the game better: but it would be of
no use to the first, to pack the cards, if his know∣ledge
stopped here, and he had no skill in the
game; nor to the second, to play the game better,
if he did not know how to pack the cards, that he
<PB N="200" REF="232"/>
might unpack them by new shuffling. Inferior
wisdom, or cunning, may get the better of folly;
but superior wisdom will get the better of cunning.
Wisdom and cunning have often the same objects;
but a wise man will have more and greater in his
view. The least will not fill his soul, nor ever
become the principal theme; but will be pursued
in subserviency, in subordination at least, to the
other. Wisdom and cunning may employ some∣times

<P>THE cunning minister neither sees, nor is con∣cerned
to see, any further than his personal inte∣rest,
and the support of his administration, require.
If such a man overcomes any actual difficulty,
avoids any immediate distress, or, without doing
either of these effectually, gains a little time, by
all the low artifice which cunning is ready to sug∣gest,
and baseness of mind to employ, he triumphs,
and is flattered by his mercenary train, on the
great event, which amounts often to no more than
this, that he got into distress by one series of faults,
and out of it by another. The wise minister sees,
and is concerned to see, further, because govern∣ment
has a further concern: he sees the objects
that are distant, as well as those that are near, and
all their remote relations, and even their indirect
tendencies. He thinks of same as well as applause,
and prefers that which, to be enjoyed, must be
given, to that which may be bought. He con∣siders
his administration as a single day in the great
year of government; but as a day that is affected
by those which went before, and that must affect
those which are to follow. He combines, there∣fore,
<PB N="202" REF="234"/>
and compares, all these objects, relations,
and tendencies; and the judgment he makes on
an entire, not a partial, survey of them, is the
rule of his conduct. That scheme of the reason
of state which lies open before a wise minister,
contains all the great principles of government,
and all the great interests of his country; so that,
as he prepares some events, he prepares against
others, whether they be likely to happen during
his administration, or in some future time.</P>

<P>THE situation of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> the character

her soil make them necessary to her well-being.
<PB N="203" REF="235"/>
By trade and commerce we grew a rich and power∣ful
nation, and by their decay we are growing
poor and impotent. As trade and commerce en∣rich,
so they fortify our country. The sea is our
barrier, ships are our fortresses, and the mariners,
that trade and commerce alone can furnish, are the
garrisons to defend them. <HI>France</HI> lies under great
disadvantages in trade and commerce, by the na∣ture
of her government. Her advantages in situa∣tion
are as great, at least, as ours. Those that
arise from the temper and character of her people
are a little different perhaps, and yet upon the
whole equivalent. Those of her climate and her
soil are superior to ours, and indeed to those of
any <HI>European</HI> nation. The <HI>United Provinces</HI> have
the same advantages that we have in the nature of
their government, more perhaps in the temper and
character of their people; less, to be sure, in their
situation, climate, and soil. But without descend∣ing
into a longer detail of the advantages and dis∣advantages
attending each of these nations, in
trade and commerce, it is sufficient for my present
purpose to observe, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> stands in a
certain middle between the other two, with regard
to <HI>wealth</HI> and <HI>power</HI> arising from these springs.
A less, and a less constant, application to the im∣provement
of these may serve the ends of <HI>France;</HI>
a greater is necessary in this country; and a greater
still in <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> may improve their
natural wealth and power by the improvement of
trade and commerce. We can have no wealth, nor
<PB N="204" REF="236"/>
power, by consequence, as <HI>Europe</HI> is now constituted,
without the improvement of them, nor in any
degree but proportionably to this improvement.
The <HI>Dutch</HI> cannot subsist without them. They
bring wealth to other nations, and are necessary
to the well-being of them; but they supply the
<HI>Dutch</HI> with food and raiment, and are necessary
even to their being.</P>
<P>The result of what has been said, is, in general,
that the wealth and power of all nations depend∣ing
so much on their trade and commerce, and
every nation being, like the three I have men∣tioned,
in such different circumstances of advan∣tage
or disadvantage in the pursuit of this com∣mon
interest; a good government, and therefore
the government of a patriot King, will be directed
constantly to make the most of every advantage
that nature has given, or art can procure, towards
the improvement of trade and commerce. And
this is one of the principal criterions, by which
we are to judge whether governors are in the true
interest of the people or not.</P>
<P>It results, in particular, that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> might
improve her wealth and power in a proportion su∣perior
to that of any nation who can be deemed
her rival, if the advantages she has were as wisely
cultivated, as they will be in the reign of a patriot
King. To be convinced more thoroughly of this
truth, a very short process of reasoning will suffice.

of their trade and commerce; which

and unslackened application, industry, order, and

<HEAD>THE PRIVATE CHARACTER OF ALEX∣ANDER

<P><HI>ALEXANDER</HI> had violent passions, and those
for wine and women were predominant, after his
ambition. They were <HI>spots</HI> in his character before
they prevailed by the force of habit: as soon as
they began to do so, the king and the hero ap∣peared
less, the rake and bully more. <HI>Persepolis</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="238"/>
was burnt at the instigation of <HI>Thais,</HI> and <HI>Clytus</HI> was
killed in a drunken brawl. He repented indeed of
these two horrible actions, and was again the King
and Hero upon many occasions; but he had not
been enough on his guard, when the strongest in∣citements
to vanity and to sensual pleasures offered
themselves at every moment to him: and when he
stood in all his easy hours surrounded by women and
eunuchs, by the pandars, parasites, and buffoons
of a voluptuous court, they who could not ap∣proach
the King, approached the man, and by se∣ducing
the man they betrayed the King. His faults
became habits. The <HI>Macedonians,</HI> who did not or
would not see the one, saw the other; and he fell
a sacrifice to their resentments, to their fears, and
to those factions that will arise under an odious
government, as well as under one that grows in∣to

<P>OTHER characters might be brought to con∣trast

or the eldest <HI>Cato:</HI> and there will be no ob∣jection
to a comparison of such citizens of <HI>Rome</HI> as
these were with Kings of the first magnitude. Now
the reputation of the first <HI>Scipio</HI> was not so clear
and uncontroverted in <HI>private</HI> as in <HI>public</HI> life; nor
was he allowed, by all, to be a man of such severe
virtue as he affected, and as that age required.
<HI>Naevius</HI> was thought to mean him in some verses
<PB N="207" REF="239"/>
<HI>Gellius</HI> has preserved: and <HI>Valerius Antias</HI> made no
scruple to assert, that, far from restoring the fair
<HI>Spaniard</HI> to her family, he debauched and kept her.
Notwithstanding this, what authority did he not
maintain? In what esteem and veneration did he
not live and die? With what panegyrics has not
the whole torrent of writers rolled down his repu∣tation
even to these days? This could not have hap∣pened,
if the vice imputed to him had shewn itself
in any scandalous appearances, to eclipse the lustre
of the general, the consul, or the citizen. The
same reflection might be extended to <HI>Cato,</HI> who
loved wine as well as <HI>Scipio</HI> loved women. Men did
not judge in the days of the elder <HI>Cato,</HI> perhaps,
as <HI>Seneca</HI> was ready to do in those of the younger,
that drunkenness could be no crime if <HI>Cato</HI>
drank: but <HI>Cato</HI>'s passion, as well as that of <HI>Scipio,</HI>
was subdued and kept under by his public charac∣ter.
His virtue warmed, instead of cooling, by
this indulgence to his genius or natural temper:
and one may gather from what <HI>Tully</HI> puts into his
mouth in the treatise concerning old-age, that even
his love of wine was rendered subservient, instead
of doing hurt, to the measures he pursued in his

<P><HI>LEWIS</HI> the Fourteenth was King in an abso∣lute

genius makes it as fit perhaps to impose on them by
admiration and awe, as to gain and hold them by
affection. Accordingly he kept great state; was
haughty, was reserved; and all he said or did ap∣peared
to be forethought and planned. His regard
to appearances was such, that when his mistress
was the wife of another man, and he had children
by her every year, he endeavoured to cover her con∣stant
residence at court by a place she filled about
the Queen; and he dined and supped and cohabited
with the latter, in every apparent respect, as if he had
no mistress at all. Thus he raised a great reputa∣tion;
he was revered by his subjects, and admired
by his neighbours: and this was due principally
to the art with which he managed appearances, so
as to set off his virtues, to disguise his failings and
his vices, and by his example and authority to keep
a veil drawn over the futility and debauch of his

<HEAD>OF JAMES THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>HER successor had no virtues to set off; but he
had failings and vices to conceal. He could not
conceal the latter; and, void of the former, he could
not compensate for them. His failings and his
vices therefore standing in full view, he passed for
a weak Prince and an ill Man; and fell into all the
contempt wherein his memory remains to this day.
The methods he took to preserve himself from it,
served but to confirm him in it. No man can keep
the decorum of manners in life, who is not free from
every kind of <HI>affectation,</HI> as it has been said already:
but he who affects what he has no pretensions to,
or what is improper to his character and rank
in the world, is guilty of most consummate folly;
he becomes doubly ungracious, doubly indecent,
and quite ridiculous. <HI>James</HI> the First, not having
one quality to conciliate the esteem or affection of
his people to him, endeavoured to impose on their
understandings; and to create a respect for himself,
by spreading the most extravagant notions about
<HI>Kings</HI> in general, as if they were <HI>middle beings</HI> be∣tween
God and other men, and by comparing the
extent and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsearchable mysteries of their <HI>power</HI>
and <HI>prerogative</HI> to those of the divine providence.
His <HI>language</HI> and his <HI>behaviour</HI> were commonly
suited to such foolish pretensions; and thus, by as∣suming
<PB N="212" REF="244"/>
a claim to such respect and submission as
were not due to him, he lost a great part of what
was due to him. In short he began at the wrong
end; for, though the shining qualities of the King
may cover, some failings and some vices that do not
grow up to strong habits in the Man, yet must the
character of a <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good King</HI> be founded in
that of a <HI>great</HI> and a <HI>good Man.</HI> A King who lives
out of the sight of his subjects, or is never seen by
them except on his throne, can scarce be despised
as a Man, though he may be hated as a King. But
the King who lives more in their sight, and more
under their observation, may be despised before he
is hated, and even without being hated. This hap∣pened
to King <HI>James:</HI> a thousand circumstances
brought it to pass, and none more than the <HI>inde∣cent
weaknesses</HI> he had for his <HI>minions.</HI> He did not
endeavour to cure this contempt, and raise his cha∣racter,
only by affecting what he had no pretensions
to, as in the former case; but he endeavoured like∣wise
most vainly to do it by affecting what was im∣proper
to his character and rank. He did not en∣deavour
indeed to disguise his natural <HI>pusillanimity</HI>
and <HI>timidity</HI> under the mask of a bully, whilst he
was imposed upon and insulted by all his neigh∣bours,
and above all by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but he re∣tailed
the scraps of <HI>Buchanan,</HI> affected to talk much,
figured in church controversies, and put on all

<HEAD>THE PICTURE OF A PATRIOT REIGN.</HEAD>
<P>ON this subject let the imagination range through
the whole glorious scene of a patriot reign: the
beauty of the idea will inspire those transports,
which <HI>Plato</HI> imagined the vision of virtue would
inspire; if virtue could be seen. What in truth can
be so lovely, what so venerable, as to contem∣plate
a King, on whom the eyes of a whole people
are fixed, filled with admiration, and glowing with
affection? a King, in the temper of whose govern∣ment,
like that of <HI>Nerva,</HI> things so seldom allied as
empire and liberty are intimately mixed; co-exist
together inseparably, and constitute one real essence?
What spectacle can be presented to the view of the
mind so rare, so nearly divine, as a King possessed
of absolute power, neither usurped by fraud, nor
maintained by force, but the genuine effect of
esteem, of confidence, and affection; the free gift
of <HI>Liberty,</HI> who finds her greatest security in this
power, and would desire no other if the Prince on
the throne could be, what his people wish him to
be, immortal? Of such a Prince, and of such a

<HEAD>GENERAL MAXIMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE minister who grows less by his eleva∣tion,
is like a little statue placed on a mighty
pedestal.</P>
<P>I cannot help being surprised that a man should
expect to be trusted with a crown, because he is
born a prince, in a country where he could not
be trusted by law with a constable's staff, if only
born a private person.</P>
<P>Ministers who punish what they might prevent,
are more culpable than those who offend.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="247"/>
When a free people crouch like camels to be
loaded, the next at hand, no matter who, mounts
them, and they soon feel the whip and spur of
their tyrant.</P>
<P>A tyrant, whether prince or minister, resembles
the devil in many respects, particularly in this,—
He is often both the tempter and tormentor: he
makes the criminal, and he punishes the crime.</P>
<P>To know when to yield, in government, is at
least as necessary as to know when to lose in trade;
and he who cannot do the first is so little likely
to govern a kingdom well, that it is more than
probable he would govern a shop ill.</P>
<P>Experience continually shews us, that they who
made kings what they are, are apt to take them
for what they are not.</P>
<P>The very same minister who exalts his master's
throne on the ruins of the constitution, that he
may govern without controul, or retire without
danger, would do just the reverse, if any turn of
affairs enabled him to compound in that manner
the better for himself.</P>
<P>The laughers are for those who have most wit,
and the serious part of mankind, for those who
have most reason on their side.</P>

There is a plain and real difference between
jealousy and distrust. Men may be jealous on ac∣count
of their liberties, even when they have no
immediate distrust that the persons who govern de∣sign
to invade them.</P>
<P>It would be highly unjust to impute the scurri∣lities
of scurrilous authors to any prompter, be∣cause
they have in themselves all that is necessary
to constitute a scold; ill manners, impudence, a
soul mouth, and a fouler heart.</P>
<P>Real friendship can never exist among those
whose actions have banished virtue and truth.</P>
<P>Whilst a great event is in suspense, the action
warms; and the very suspense, made up of hope
and fear, maintains no unpleasing agitation in the
mind.</P>
<P>When a house, which is old and quite decayed,

<P>According to the present form of our constitu∣tion,
every member of either House of Parliament

or indeed with <HI>sufficient power</HI> and <HI>strength.</HI></P>
<P>To constitute <HI>a patriot,</HI> whether <HI>king</HI> or <HI>subject,</HI>
there must be something more substantial than a

no happiness can be enjoyed by society.</P>
<P>The utmost private men can do, who remain
untainted by the general contagion <HI>in a degenerate

age,</HI> is to keep the spirit of liberty alive in a few
breasts, to protest against what they cannot hin∣der,
and to claim on every occasion what they
cannot by their own strength recover.</P>
<P>A standing parliament is, in the nature of it,
as dangerous as a standing army, and may be∣come,
in some conjunctures, much more fatal to
liberty.</P>
<P>The sight of the mind differs very much from
the sight of the body, and its operations are fre∣quently
the reverse of the other: objects at a di∣stance

and diminish as they are brought nearer.</P>
<P>Tyranny and slavery do not so properly consist

them whenever and for whatever they are
inflicted.</P>
<P>The collective body of the people of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain,</HI>
delegate but do not give up, trust but do
not alienate, their right and their power, and can∣not
be undone, by having beggary or slavery

and directs all his thoughts and actions, to
the good of his country.</P>
<P>Eloquence, that leads mankind by the ears,
gives a nobler superiority than power that every
dunce may use, or fraud that every knave may
employ, to lead them by the nose. But eloquence
must flow like a stream that is fed by an abundant

on some gaudy day, and remain dry the rest of

<P><PB N="221" REF="253"/>
The true image of a free people, governed by a
<HI>patriot King,</HI> is that of a patriarchal family, where
the head and all the members are united by one
common interest, and animated by one common
spirit; and where, if any are perverse enough to
have another, they will be soon borne down by
the superiority of those who have the same; and,
far from making a division, they will but confirm
the union of the little state.</P>
<P>Faction is to party what the <HI>superlative</HI> is to

<P>Parties, even before they degenerate into abso∣lute

which are not, or which are not allowed to be,
those of the community, by others.</P>
<P>From the misapplication of superior parts to the
hurt, no argument can be drawn against this po∣sition,
that they were given for the good of man∣kind.</P>

continue in it as long or end it as soon as they
please.</P>
<P>Superior talents, and superior rank, among our
fellow creatures, whether acquired by birth, or by
the course of accidents, and the success of our own
industry, are noble prerogatives: but shall he who
possesses them repine at the obligations they lay
him under of passing his whole life in the noblest
occupation of which human nature is capable?</P>
<P>A life dedicated to the service of our country
admits the full use, and no life should admit the
abuse, of pleasures: the least are consistent with a
constant discharge of our public duty, the great∣est
arise from it.</P>
<P><HI>Cato</HI>'s virtue often glowed with wine; and the
love of women did not hinder <HI>Caesar</HI> from forming
and executing the greatest projects that ambition
ever suggested.</P>
<P>Our's does all that a constitution can do, all
that can be done by legal provisions, to secure the
interests of the people, by maintaining the inte∣grity
of their trustees; and, lest all this should
fail, it gives frequent opportunities to the people
to secure their interest themselves, by mending
their choice: so that, as a bad king must stand in
awe of an honest parliament, a corrupt house of
<PB N="223" REF="255"/>
commons must stand in awe of an honest peo∣ple.</P>
<P>Danger commences when the breach is made,
not when the attack is begun. He who neglects
to stop the leak as soon as it is discovered, in hopes
to save his ship by pumping when the water
gushes in by violence, deserves to be drowned.
Our constitution is not, like the schemes of some
politicians, a jumble of disjointed, incoherent
whimsies, but a noble and wise system, the essen∣tial
parts of which are so proportioned, and so
intimately connected, that a change in one begets
a change in the whole.</P>
<P>A free people may be sometimes betrayed; but
no people will betray themselves, and sacrifice their
liberty, unless they fall into a state of universal
corruption; and, when they are once fallen into
such a state, they will be sure to lose what they
deserve no longer to enjoy.</P>
<P>Whatever political speculations, instead of pre∣paring
us to be useful to society, and to promote
the happiness of mankind, are only systems for
gratifying private ambition, and promoting pri∣vate

<HEAD>HISTORY THE UNIVERSAL TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>THE love of history seems inseparable from
human nature, because it seems inseparable from
self-love. The same principle in this instance
carries us forward and backward, to future and to
past ages. We imagine that the things which af∣fect
us, must affect posterity: this sentiment runs
through mankind, from <HI>Caesar</HI> down to the parish∣clerk
in <HI>Pope's</HI> Miscellany. We are fond of pre∣serving,
as far as it is in our frail power, the me∣mory
of our own adventures, of those of our own
time, and of those that preceded it. Rude heaps
of stones have been raised, and ruder hymns have
been composed, for this purpose, by nations who
had not yet the use of arts and letters. To go no
further back, the triumphs of <HI>Odin</HI> were cele∣brated
in <HI>Runic</HI> songs, and the feats of our <HI>British</HI>
ancestors were recorded in those of their bards.
The savages of <HI>America</HI> have the same custom at
this day: and long historical ballads of their hunt∣ings
and their wars are sung at all their festivals.
There is no need of saying how this passion grows
among civilized nations, in proportion to the
means of gratifying it: but let us observe that the
same principle of nature directs us as strongly, and
more generally as well as more early, to indulge
our own curiosity, instead of preparing to gratify
<PB N="229" REF="261"/>
that of others. The child hearkens with delight
to the tales of his nurse; he learns to read, and he
devours with eagerness fabulous legends and no∣vels.
In riper years, he applies himself to history,
or to that which he takes for history, to authorised
romance: and even in age, the desire of knowing
what has happened to other men, yields to the de∣sire
alone of relating what has happened to our∣selves.
Thus history, true or false, speaks to our
passions always. What pity is it, that even the
best should speak to our understandings so seldom!
That it does so, we have none to blame but our∣selves.
Nature has done her part. She has opened
this study to every man who can read and think:
and what she has made the most agreeable, reason
can make the most useful, application of our minds.
But if we consult our reason, we shall be far from
following the examples of our fellow-creatures, in
this as in most other cases, who are so proud of
being rational. We shall neither read to soothe
our indolence, nor to gratify our vanity: as little
shall we content ourselves to drudge like gram∣marians
and critics, that others may be able to
study, with greater ease and profit, like philoso∣phers
and statesmen: as little shall we affect the
slender merit of becoming great scholars at the
expence of groping all our lives in the dark mazes
of antiquity. All these mistake the true drift of
study, and the true use of history. Nature gave
us curiosity to excite the industry of our minds;
<PB N="230" REF="262"/>
but she never intended it should be made the prin∣cipal,
much less the sole, object of their applica∣tion.
The true and proper object of this applica∣tion,
is a constant improvement in private and in
public virtue. An application to any study, that
tends neither directly nor indirectly to make us
better men and better citizens, is at best but a
specious and ingenious sort of idleness, to use an
expression of <HI>Tillotson:</HI> and the knowledge we ac∣quire
by it is a creditable kind of ignorance, no∣thing
more. This creditable kind of ignorance is,
in my opinion, the whole benefit which the gene∣rality
of men, even of the most learned, reap from
the study of history: and yet the study of history
seems to me, of all other, the most proper to train
us up to private and public virtue.</P>

<HEAD>GENIUS, HISTORY, AND EXPERIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE school of example is the world: and the
masters of this school are history and experience.
I am far from contending that the former is pre∣ferable
to the latter. I think, upon the whole,
otherwise: but this I say, that the former is abso∣lutely
necessary to prepare us for the latter, and
to accompany us whilst we are under the discipline
of the latter, that is, through the whole course of
our lives. No doubt, some few men may be quoted,
to whom nature gave what art and industry can
<PB N="231" REF="263"/>
give to no man. But such examples will prove
nothing against me, because I admit that the study
of history without experience is insufficient, but
assert that experience itself is so without genius.
Genius is preferable to the other two; but I would
wish to find the three together: for how great so∣ever
a genius may be, and how much soever he
may acquire new light and heat as he proceeds in
his rapid course, certain it is that he will never
shine with the full lustre, nor shed the full influ∣ence
he is capable of, unless to his own experience
he adds the experience of other men and other ages.
Genius, without the improvement at least of ex∣perience,
is what comets once were thought to be,
a blazing meteor, irregular in his course, and dan∣gerous
in his approach; of no use to any system,
and able to destroy any. Mere sons of earth, if
they have experience, without any knowledge of
the history of the world, are but half scholars in
the science of mankind. And if they are conver∣sant
in history, without experience, they are worse
than ignorant; they are pedants, always incapa∣ble,
sometimes meddling and presuming. The
man who has all three, is an honour to his coun∣try,
and a public blessing.</P>

<HEAD>EXAMPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is scarce any folly or vice more epide∣mical
among the sons of men, than that ridicu∣lous
and hurtful vanity, by which the people of
each country are apt to prefer themselves to those
of every other, and to make their own customs,
and manners, and opinions, the standards of right
and wrong, of true and false. The <HI>Chinese</HI> Man∣darins
were strangely surprised, and almost incre∣dulous,
when the <HI>Jesuits</HI> shewed them how small
a figure their empire made in the general map of
the world. The <HI>Samojedes</HI> wondered much at the
Czar of <HI>Muscovy</HI> for not living among them: and
the <HI>Hottentott,</HI> who returned from <HI>Europe,</HI> stripped
himself naked as soon as he came home, put on
his bracelets of guts and garbage, and grew stink∣ing
and lousy as fast as he could. Now nothing
can contribute more to prevent us from being
tainted with this vanity, than to accustom our∣selves
early to contemplate the different nations of
the earth in that vast map which history spreads
before us, in their rise and their fall, in their bar∣barous
and civilized states, in the likeness and un∣likeness
of them all to one another, and of each
to itself. By frequently renewing this prospect to
the mind, the <HI>Mexican</HI> with his cap and coat of
feathers, sacrificing a human victim to his god,
will not appear more savage to our eyes, than the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> with an hat on his head, and a gonilla
<PB N="233" REF="265"/>
round his neck, sacrificing whole nations to his
ambition, his avarice, and even the wantonness of
his cruelty. I might shew, by a multitude of
other examples, how history prepares us for expe∣rience,
and guides us in it: and many of these
would be both curious and important. I might
likewise bring several other instances, wherein hi∣story
serves to purge the mind of those national
partialities and prejudices that we are apt to con∣tract
in our education, and that experience for
the most part rather confirms than removes, be∣cause
it is for the most part confined, like our

<HEAD>HISTORICAL EXAMPLE ENTIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE examples which history presents to us,
both of men and of events, are generally com∣plete:
the whole example is before us, and con∣sequently
the whole lesson, or sometimes the va∣rious
lessons which philosophy proposes to teach
us by this example. For first, as to men; we see
them at their whole length in history, and we see
them generally there through a medium less par∣tial
at least than that of experience: for I ima∣gine,
that a Whig or a Tory, whilst those parties
subsisted, would have condemned in <HI>Saturninus</HI> the
spirit of faction which he applauded in his own
tribunes, and would have applauded in <HI>Drusus</HI>
the spirit of moderation which he despised in those
<PB N="234" REF="266"/>
of the contrary party, and which he suspected and
hated in those of his own party. The villain who
has imposed on mankind by his power or cunning,
and whom experience could not unmask for a time,
is unmasked at length: and the honest man, who
has been misunderstood or defamed, is justified be∣fore
his story ends. Or if this does not happen,
if the villain dies with his mask on, in the midst
of applause and honour and wealth and power,
and if the honest man dies under the same load of
calumny and disgrace under which he lived, driven
perhaps into exile, and exposed to want; yet we
see historical justice executed, the name of one
branded with infamy, and that of the other cele∣brated
with panegyric to succeeding ages.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HISTORY AND
EXPERIENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THUS again as to events that stand recorded
in history: we see them all, we see them as they
followed one another, or as they produced one
another, causes or effects, immediate or remote.
We are cast back, as it were, into former ages:
we live with the men who lived before us, and we
inhabit countries that we never saw. Place is en∣larged,
and time prolonged, in this manner; so
that the man who applies himself early to the
study of history, may acquire in a few years, and
before he sets his foot abroad in the world, not
<PB N="235" REF="267"/>
only a more extended knowledge of mankind, but
the experience of more centuries, than any of the
patriarchs saw. The events we are witnesses of,
in the course of the longest life, appear to us very
often original, unprepared, single, and un-rela∣tive,
if I may use such an expression for want of
a better in <HI>English;</HI> in <HI>French</HI> I would say <HI>isolés:</HI>
they appear such very often, are called accidents,
and looked upon as the effects of chance; a word,
by the way, which is in constant use, and has no
determinate meaning. We get over the present
difficulty, we improve the momentary advantage,
as well as we can, and we look no farther. Ex∣perience
can carry us no farther: for experience
can go a very little way back in discovering
causes; and effects are not the objects of experi∣ence
till they happen. From hence many errors
in judgment, and by consequence in condust, ne∣cessarily
arise. And here too lies the difference
we are speaking of between history and experi∣ence.
The advantage on the side of the former
is double. In ancient history, as we have said al∣ready,
the examples are complete, which are in∣complete
in the course of experience. The begin∣ning,
the progression, and the end appear, not of
particular reigns, much less of particular enter∣prises,
or systems of policy alone, but of govern∣ments,
of nations, of empires, and of all the va∣rious
systems that have succeeded one another in
the course of their duration. In modern history,
the examples may be, and sometimes are, in∣complete;
<PB N="236" REF="268"/>
but they have this advantage when
they are so, that they serve to render complete the
examples of our own time. Experience is doubly
defective; we are born too late to see the begin∣ning,
and we die too soon to see the end of many
things. History supplies both these defects. Mo∣dern
history shews the causes, when experience
presents the effects alone: and ancient history ena∣bles
us to guess at the effects, when experience
presents the causes alone.</P>

<HEAD>EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT now is education? that part, that
principal and most neglected part of it, I mean,
which tends to form the moral character? It is,
I think, an institution designed to lead men from
their tender years, by precept and example, by
argument and authority, to the practice, and to
the habit of practising these rules. The stronger
our appetites, desires, and passions are, the harder
indeed is the task of education; but, when the
efforts of education are proportioned to this
strength, although our keenest appetites and de∣sires,
and our ruling passions, cannot be reduced
to a quiet and uniform submission, yet are not
their excesses assuaged? are not their abuses and
misapplications, in some degree, diverted or check∣ed?
Though the pilot cannot lay the storm, can∣not
he carry the ship by his art better through it,
<PB N="237" REF="269"/>
and often prevent the wreck that would always
happen without him? If <HI>Alexander,</HI> who loved
wine, and was naturally choleric, had been bred
under the severity of <HI>Roman</HI> discipline, it is pro∣bable
he would neither have made a bonfire of
<HI>Persepolis</HI> for his whore, nor have killed his friend.
If <HI>Scipio,</HI> who was naturally given to women, for
which anecdote we have, if I mistake not, the
authority of <HI>Polybius,</HI> as well as some verses of
<HI>Naevius</HI> preserved by <HI>A. Gellius,</HI> had been edu∣cated
by <HI>Olympias</HI> at the court of <HI>Philip,</HI> it is im∣probable
that he would have restored the beautiful
<HI>Spaniard.</HI> In short, if the renowned <HI>Socrates</HI> had
not corrected nature by art, this first apostle of the
Gentiles had been a very profligate fellow by his
own confession; for he was inclined to all the
vices <HI>Zopyrus</HI> imputed to him, as they say, on the
observation of his physiognomy.</P>
<P>With him, therefore, who denies the effects of
education, it would be in vain to dispute; and
with him who admits them, there can be no dis∣pute
concerning that share which I ascribe to the
study of history, in forming our moral characters,
and making us better men. The very persons
who pretend that inclinations cannot be restrained,
nor habits corrected, against our natural bent,
would be the first perhaps to prove in certain cases
the contrary. A fortune at court, or the favours
of a lady, have prevailed on many to conceal,
and they could not conceal without restraining,
<PB N="238" REF="270"/>
which is one step towards correcting, the vices
they were by nature addicted to the most. Shall
we imagine now, that the beauty of virtue and the
deformity of vice, the charms of a bright and last∣ing
reputation, the terror of being delivered over
as criminals to all posterity, the real benefit ari∣sing
from a conscientious discharge of the duty we
owe to others, which benefit fortune can neither
hinder nor take away, and the reasonableness of
conforming ourselves to the designs of God, ma∣nifested
in the constitution of the human nature;
shall we imagine, I say, that all these are not
able to acquire the same power over those who are
continually called upon to a contemplation of
them, and they who apply themselves to the study
of history are so called upon, as other motives,
mean and sordid in comparison of these, can usurp

<HEAD>A LITERARY MONSTER.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY must have a certain degree of pro∣bability
and authenticity, or the examples we find
in it will not carry a force sufficient to make due
impressions on our minds, nor to illustrate nor to
strengthen the precepts of philosophy and the rules
of good policy. But besides, when histories have
this necessary authenticity and probability, there
is much discernment to be employed in the choice
and the use we make of them. Some are to be
<PB N="239" REF="271"/>
read, some are to be studied, and some may be
neglected entirely, not only without detriment,
but with advantage. Some are the proper objects
of one man's curiosity, some of others, and some
of all men's; but all history is not an object of
curiosity for any man. He who improperly, wan∣tonly,
and absurdly makes it so, indulges a sort
of canine appetite: the curiosity of one, like the
hunger of the other, devours ravenously and with∣out
distinction whatever falls in its way; but nei∣ther
of them digests. They heap crudity upon
crudity, and nourish and improve nothing but
their distemper. Some such characters I have
known, though it is not the most common ex∣treme
into which men are apt to fall. One of
them I knew in this country. He joined, to a
more than athletic strength of body, a prodigious
memory, and to both a prodigious industry. He
had read almost constantly twelve or fourteen hours
a day, for five-and-twenty or thirty years; and
had heaped together as much learning as could
be crouded into an head. In the course of my ac∣quaintance
with him, I consulted him once or
twice, not oftener; for I found this mass of learn∣ing
of as little use to me as to the owner. The
man was communicative enough, but nothing was
distinct in his mind. How could it be otherwise?
he had never spared time to think; all was em∣ployed
in reading. His reason had not the merit
of common mechanism. When you press a watch,
or pull a clock, they answer your question with
<PB N="240" REF="272"/>
precision; for they repeat exactly the hour of the
day, and tell you neither more nor less than you
desire to know. But when you asked this man a
question, he overwhelmed you by pouring forth
all that the several terms or words of your ques∣tion
recalled to his memory: and, if he omitted
any thing, it was that very thing to which the
sense of the whole question should have led him
and confined him. To ask him a question, was
to wind up a spring in his memory, that rattled
on with vast rapidity, and confused noise, till the

<HEAD>REASON AND INSTINCT.</HEAD>
<P>THE far greatest part of mankind appears re∣duced
to a lower state than other animals, in that
very respect, on account of which we claim so
great superiority over them; because instinct, that
has its due effect, is preferable to reason that has
not. I suppose in this place, with philosophers,
and the vulgar, that which I am in no wise ready
to affirm, that other animals have no share of hu∣man
reason: for, let me say by the way, it is
much more likely other animals should share the
human, which is denied, than that man should
share the divine reason, which is affirmed, But,
supposing our monopoly of reason, would not your
lordship chuse to walk upon four legs, to wear a
<PB N="241" REF="273"/>
long tail, and to be called a beast, with the ad∣vantage
of being determined by irresistible and
unerring instinct to those truths that are necessary
to your well-being; rather than to walk on two
legs, to wear no tail, and to be honoured with the
title of man, at the expence of deviating from
them perpetually? Instinct acts spontaneously,
whenever its action is necessary, and directs the
animal according to the purpose for which it was
implanted in him. Reason is a nobler and more
extensive faculty; for it extends to the unnecessary
as well as necessary, and to satisfy our curiosity as
well as our wants: but reason must be excited, or
she will remain unactive; she must be left free, or
she will conduct us wrong, and carry us farther
astray from her own precincts than we should go
without her help: in the first case, we have no
sufficient guide; and in the second, the more we
employ our reason, the more unreasonable we are.</P>
<P>Now if all this be so, if reason has so little,
and ignorance, passion, interest, and custom, so
much to do, in forming our opinions and our ha∣bits,
and in directing the whole conduct of human
life; is it not a thing desirable by every thinking
man, to have the opportunity, indulged to so few
by the course of accidents, the opportunity "se∣cum
esse, et secum vivere," of living some years
at least to ourselves, and for ourselves, in a state
of freedom, under the laws of reason, instead of
passing our whole time in a state of vassalage under
<PB N="242" REF="274"/>
those of authority and custom? Is it not worth our
while to contemplate ourselves, and others, and all
the things of this world, once before we leave them,
through the medium of pure, and, if I may say
so, of undefiled reason.? Is it not worth our while
to approve or condemn, on our own authority,
what we receive in the beginning of life on the au∣thority
of other men, who were not then better able

<HEAD>ABSTRACTION FROM THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST we remain in the world, we are all
fettered down, more or less, to one common level,
and have neither all the leisure, nor all the means
and advantages, to soar above it, which we may
procure to ourselves by breaking these fetters in re∣treat.
To talk of abstracting ourselves from mat∣ter,
laying aside body, and being resolved, as it
were, into pure intellect, is proud, metaphysical,
unmeaning jargon: but to abstract ourselves from
the prejudices, and habits, and pleasures, and bu∣siness
of the world, is no more than many are,
though all are not, capable of doing. They who
can do this, may elevate their souls in retreat to
an higher station, and may take from thence such
a view of the world, as the second <HI>Scipio</HI> took in
his dream, from the seats of the blessed, when the
whole earth appeared so little to him, that he could
<PB N="243" REF="275"/>
scarce discern that speck of dirt, the <HI>Roman</HI> em∣pire.
Such a view as this will increase our know∣ledge

certainty; will dispel the intoxicating fumes of
philosophical presumption, and teach us to esta∣blish

securely, in resignation: in short, such a view will

<HEAD>THE IMPROVEMENT OF TIME.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR Lordship may think this perhaps a little
too sanguine, for one who has lost so much time
already: you may put me in mind, that human life
has no second spring, no second summer: you may
ask me what I mean by sowing in autumn, and
whether I hope to reap in winter? My answer
will be, that I think very differently from most
men, of the time we have to pass, and the business
we have to do in this world. I think we have more
of one, and less of the other, than is commonly
supposed. Our want of time, and the shortness
of human life, are some of the principal common-place
<PB N="244" REF="276"/>
complaints, which we prefer against the esta∣blished
order of things: they are the grumblings
of the vulgar, and the pathetic lamentations of the
philosopher; but they are impertinent and impious
in both. The man of business despises the man of
pleasure, for squandering his time away; the man
of pleasure pities or laughs at the man of business,
for the same thing: and yet both concur superci∣liously
and absurdly to find fault with the <HI>Supreme
Being,</HI> for having given them so little time. The
philosopher, who mispends it very often as much
as the others, joins in the same cry, and authorises
this impiety. <HI>Theophrastus</HI> thought it extremely
hard to die at ninety, and to go out of the world
when he had just learned how to live in it. His
master <HI>Aristotle</HI> found fault with nature, for treat∣ing
man in this respect worse than several other
animals: both very unphilosophically! and I love
<HI>Seneca</HI> the better for his quarrel with the <HI>Stagirite</HI>
on this head. We see, in so many instances, a just
proportion of things, according to their several
relations to one another, that philosophy should
lead us to conclude this proportion preserved even
where we cannot discern it; instead of leading us
to conclude that it is not preserved where we do
not discern it, or where we think that we see
the contrary. To conclude otherwise, is shocking
presumption. It is to presume that the system of
the universe would have been more wisely con∣trived,
if creatures of our low rank among intel∣lectual
natures had been called to the councils of
<PB N="245" REF="277"/>
the Most High; or that the Creator ought to mend
his work by the advice of the creature. That life
which seems to our self-love so short, when we
compare it with the ideas we frame of eternity, or
even with the duration of some other beings, will
appear sufficient, upon a less partial view, to all
the ends of our creation, and of a just proportion
in the successive course of generations. The term
itself is long: we render it short; and the want
we complain of flows from our profusion, not from
our poverty. We are all arrant spend thrifts; some
of us dissipate our estates on the trifles, some on the
superfluities, and then we all complain that we
want the necessaries, of life. The much greatest
part never reclaim, but die bankrupts to God and
man. Others reclaim late; and they are apt to
imagine, when they make up their accounts and
see how their fund is diminished, that they have not
enough remaining to live upon, because they have not
the whole. But they deceive themselves: they were
richer than they thought, and they are not yet poor.
If they husband well the remainder, it will be
found sufficient for all the necessaries, and for some
of the superfluities, and trifles too perhaps, of
life: but then the former order of expence must be
inverted; and the necessaries of life must be pro∣vided,
before they put themselves to any cost for
the trifles or superfluities.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRUE CURE OF AFFLICTION.</HEAD>
<P>DISSIPATION of mind, and length of time,
are the remedies to which the greatest part of man∣kind
trust in their afflictions. But the first of these
works a temporary, the second a flow, effect: and
both are unworthy of a wise man. Are we to fly
from ourselves that we may fly from our misfor∣tunes,
and fondly to imagine that the disease is
cured because we find means to get some moments
of respite from pain? Or shall we expect from
time, the physician of brutes, a lingering and un∣certain
deliverance? Shall we wait to be happy
till we can forget that we are miserable, and owe
to the weakness of our faculties a tranquillity
which ought to be the effect of their strength? Far
otherwise. Let us set all our past and our present
afflictions at once before our eyes. Let us resolve
to overcome them, instead of flying from them, or
wearing out the sense of them by long and igno∣minious
patience. Instead of palliating remedies,
let us use the incision-knife and the caustic, search
the wound to the bottom, and work an immediate
and radical cure.</P>

<HEAD>CHANGE OF PLACE IN THE ORDER OF
NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>There are some persons who are of opinion that,
as the whole universe suffers a continual rota∣tion,
<PB N="247" REF="279"/>
and Nature seems to delight in it; or to pre∣serve
herself by it, so there is in the minds of men
a natural restlessness, which inclines them to change
of place, and to the shifting their habitations.
This opinion has at least an appearance of truth, which
the other [<HI>a prepossession in favour of some particular
country</HI>] wants; and is countenanced, as the other
is contradicted, by experience. But, whatever the
reasons be, which must have varied infinitely in
an infinite number of cases, and an immense space of
time; true it is in fact, that the families and na∣tions
of the world have been in a continual fluctu∣ation,
roaming about on the face of the globe,
driving and driven out by turns. What a number
of colonies has <HI>Asia</HI> sent into <HI>Europe!</HI> The <HI>Phoe∣nicians</HI>
planted the coast of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea,
and pushed their settlements even into the Ocean.
The <HI>Etrurians</HI> were of <HI>Asiatic</HI> extraction; and, to
mention no more, the <HI>Romans,</HI> those lords of the
world, acknowledged a <HI>Trojan</HI> exile for the founder
of their empire How many migrations have there
been, in return to these, from <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>Asia!</HI>
They would be endless to enumerate; for, besides
the <HI>AEolic,</HI> the <HI>Ionic,</HI> and others of almost equal
fame, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> during several ages, made con∣tinual
expeditions, and built cities in several parts
of <HI>Asia.</HI> The <HI>Gauls</HI> penetrated thither too, and
established a kingdom. The <HI>European Scythians</HI>
over-run these vast provinces, and carried their
arms to the consines of <HI>Egypt. Alexander</HI> subdued
all from the <HI>Hellespont</HI> to <HI>India,</HI> and built towns,
<PB N="248" REF="280"/>
and established colonies, to secure his conquests,
and to eternise his name. From both these parts
of the world <HI>Africa</HI> has received inhabitants and
masters; and what she has received she has given.
The <HI>Tyrians</HI> built the city, and founded the repub∣lic,
of <HI>Carthage;</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> has been the language
of <HI>Egypt.</HI> In the remotest antiquity we hear of
<HI>Belus</HI> in <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> and of <HI>Ses<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stris</HI> planting his
tawny colonies in <HI>Colchos:</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> has been, in
these later ages, under the dominion of the <HI>Moors.</HI>
If we turn to <HI>Runic</HI> history, we find our fathers,
the <HI>Goths,</HI> led by <HI>Woden</HI> and by <HI>Thor,</HI> their heroes
first and their divinities afterwards, from the <HI>Asiatic
Tartary</HI> into <HI>Europe:</HI> and who can assure us that
this was their first migration? They came into
<HI>Asia</HI> perhaps by the east, from that continent to
which their sons have lately sailed from <HI>Europe</HI> by
the west: and thus, in the process of three or four
thousand years, the same race of men have pushed
their conquest and their habitations round the
globe: at least this may be supposed, as reasonably
as it is supposed, I think by <HI>Grotius,</HI> that <HI>America</HI>
was peopled from <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> The world is a
great wilderness, wherein mankind have wandered
and jostled one another about from the creation.
Some have removed by necessity, and others by
choice. One nation has been fond of seizing what
another was tired of possessing: and it will be
difficult to point out the country which is to this
day in the hands of its first inhabitants.</P>

<P>Believe me, the providence of God has esta∣blished
such an order in the world, that of all
which belongs to us the least valuable parts can
alone fall under the will of others. Whatever is best
is safest; lies out of the reach of human power;
can neither be given nor taken away. Such is this
great and beautiful work of nature, the world.
Such is the mind of man, which contemplates and
admires the world whereof it makes the noblest part.
These are inseparably ours, and as long as we re∣main
in one we shall enjoy the other. Let us march
therefore intrepidly wherever we are led by the
course of human accidents. Wherever they lead
us, on what coast soever we are thrown by them,
we shall not find ourselves absolutely strangers.
We shall meet with men and women, creatures of
the same figure, endowed with the same faculties,
and born under the same laws of nature. We shall
see the same virtues and vices, flowing from the
same general principles, but varied in a thousand
different and contrary modes, according to that
infinite variety of laws and customs which is esta∣blished
for the same universal end, the preservation
of society. We shall feel the same revolution of
seasons, and the same sun and moon will guide
the course of our year. The same azure vault,
bespangled with stars, will be every where spread

<HEAD>POVERTY REPUTABLE.</HEAD>
<P>HOW great a part of mankind bear poverty with

acquire, by reason and by reflection, what the mean∣est
artisan possesses by habit? Shall those who have
so many advantages over him be slaves to wants
and necessities of which he is ignorant? The rich,
whose wanton appetites neither the produce of one
country, nor of one part of the world, can satisfy,
for whom the whole habitable globe is ransacked,
for whom the caravans of the east are continually
in march, and the remotest seas are covered with
ships; these pampered creatures, sated with super∣fluity,
are often glad to inhabit an humble cot,
and to make an homely meal. They run for re∣fuge
<PB N="251" REF="283"/>
into the arms of frugality. Madmen that
they are, to live always in fear of what they some∣times
wish for, and to fly from that life which they
find it luxury to imitate! Let us cast our eyes
backwards on those great men who lived in the ages
of virtue, of simplicity, of frugality; and let us
blush to think that we enjoy in banishment more
than they were masters of in the midst of their
glory, in the utmost affluence of their fortune.
Let us imagine that we behold a great dictator gi∣ving
audience to the <HI>Samnit?</HI> ambassadors, and pre∣paring
on the hearth his mean repast with the same
hand which had so often subdued the enemies of
the commonwealth, and borne the triumphal lau∣rel
to the Capitol. Let us remember that <HI>Plato</HI>
had but three servants, and that <HI>Zeno</HI> had none.
<HI>Socrates,</HI> the reformer of his country, was main∣tained,
as <HI>Menenius Agrippa,</HI> the arbiter of his
country, was buried, by contribution. While <HI>At∣tilius
Regulus</HI> beat the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in <HI>Afric,</HI> the
flight of his ploughman reduced his family to di∣stress
at home, and the tillage of his little farm

portions were paid out of the treasury of the state;
for sure it was just that the people of <HI>Rome</HI> should
once pay tribute to him, who had established a per∣petual
tribute on <HI>Carthage.</HI> After such examples
shall we be afraid of poverty? shall we disdain to be

<HEAD>RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE darts of adverse fortune are always level∣led
at our heads. Some reach us; some graze
against us, and fly to wound our neighbours. Let
us therefore impose an equal temper on our minds,
and pay without murmuring the tribute which we
owe to humanity. The winter brings cold, and
we must freeze. The summer returns with heat,
and we must melt. The inclemency of the air
disorders our health, and we must be sick. Here
we are exposed to wild beasts, and there to men
more savage than the beasts: and if we escape the
inconveniencies and dangers of the air and the
earth, there are perils by water and perils by fire.
This established course of things it is not in our
power to change; but it is in our power to assume
such a greatness of mind as becomes-wise and vir∣tuous
men; as may enable us to encounter the ac∣cidents
of, life with fortitude, and to conform our∣selves
to the order of Nature, who governs her great
kingdom, the world, by continual mutations. Let
us submit to this order; let us be persuaded that
whatever does happen ought to happen, and never
be so foolish as to expostulate with Nature. The
best resolution we can take is to suffer what we can∣not
alter, and to pursue, without repining, the
<PB N="253" REF="285"/>
road which Providence, who directs every thing,
has marked out to us: for it is not enough to fol∣low;
and he is but a bad soldier who sighs, and
marches on with reluctancy. We must receive the
orders with spirit and chearfulness, and not endea∣vour
to slink out of the post which is assigned us in
this beautiful disposition of things, whereof even
our sufferings make a necessary part. Let us ad∣dress
ourselves to God, who governs all, as <HI>Clean∣thes</HI>
did in those admirable verses, which are going

<HEAD>PHILOSOPHY THE ONLY REMEDY TO
A MIND DISEASED.</HEAD>
<P>ONE considerable advantage that arises from
philosophy, consists in the sovereign antidote
which it affords to superstition and false religion.
All other remedies against that pestilent distemper
are vain, or at least uncertain. Plain good sense
and the practice of the world, which alone serve
<PB N="256" REF="287"/>
most purposes of life, are here found ineffectual:
history, as well as daily experience, furnish in∣stances
of men endowed with the strongest capacity
for business and affairs, who have all their lives
crouched under slavery to the grossest superstition.
Even gaiety and sweetness of temper, which infuse
a balm into every other wound, afford no remedy
to so virulent a poison; as we may particularly
observe of the fair sex, who, though commonly
possessed of these rich presents of nature, feel
many of their joys blasted by this importunate in∣truder.
But, when sound Philosophy has once
gained possession of the mind, superstition is effec∣tually
excluded; and one may fairly affirm, that
her triumph over this enemy is more complete than
over most of the vices and imperfections incident
to human nature. Love or anger, ambition or
avarice, have their root in the temper and affec∣tions,
which the soundest reason is scarce ever able
fully to correct; but superstition, being founded
on false opinion, must immediately vanish when
true philosophy has inspired juster sentiments of
superior powers. The contest is here more equal
between the distemper and the medicine, and no∣thing
can hinder the latter from proving effectual,
but its being false and sophisticated.</P>
<P>It will here be superfluous to magnify the me∣rits
of philosophy by displaying the pernicious
tendency of that vice of which it cures the human
<PB N="257" REF="288"/>
mind. The superstitious man, says <HI>Tully,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Divin. lib.</HI> ii.</NOTE> is mi∣serable
in every scene, in every incident of life;
even sleep itself, which banishes all other cares of
unhappy mortals, affords to him matter of new
terror; while he examines his dreams, and finds,
in those visions of the night, prognostications of
future calamities. I may add, that though death
alone can put a full period to his misery, he dares
not fly to this refuge, but still prolongs a misera∣ble
existence, from a vain fear left he offend his
Maker, by using the power with which that be∣neficent
being has endowed him. The presents
of God and nature are ravished from us by this
cruel enemy, and notwithstanding that one step
would remove us from the regions of pain and
sorrow, her menaces still chain us down to a hated
being, which she herself chiefly contributes to
render miserable.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The existence of all animals depends entirely on their attachment to self preservation.

<HEAD>SUICIDE.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who retires from life does no harm to
society: he only ceases to do good; which, if it
is an injury, is of the lowest kind.—All our obli∣gations
to do good to society seem to imply some∣thing
reciprocal. I receive the benefits of society,
and therefore ought to promote its interests; but
when I withdraw myself altogether from society,
can I be bound any longer? But, allowing that
our obligations to do good were perpetual, they
have certainly some bounds; I am not obliged to
do a small good to society at the expence of a
great harm to myself. Why then should I prolong
a miserable existence, because of some frivolous
advantage which the public may perhaps receive
from me? If, upon account of age and infirmi∣ties,
I may lawfully resign any office, and employ
my time altogether in fencing against these cala∣mities,
and alleviating as much as possible the
miseries of my future life; why may I not cut
short these miseries at once by an action which is
no more prejudicial to society? But suppose that
it is no longer in my power to promote the in∣terest
of society, suppose that I am a burthen to
it, suppose that my life hinders some person from
being much more useful to society; in such cases,
my resignation of life must not only be innocent,
but laudable: and most people who lie under any
temptation to abandon existence, are in some such
<PB N="259" REF="290"/>
situation; those who have health, or power, or
authority, have commonly better reason to be in
humour with the world.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">On this extravagant hypothesis the authority
of creation and dissolution is made reciprocal. The
man who assumes the liberty of destroying himself,
were he possessed of the power, might also be his own
creator; his imaginary insignificance to society being
as inclusive in the one case, as any chimerical ad∣vantage
to it that may accidentally strike him, can be

are too slender for the business assigned

that commodity is capable of attaining; yet it is
necessary, at least very useful, that there should

Every thing is in common betwixt soul and body:
