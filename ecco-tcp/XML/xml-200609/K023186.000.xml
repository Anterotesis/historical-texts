<L><NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Flore, bono claróque fidelis amice Neroni.</NOTE><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>Ear Col'nel! <HI>Cobham</HI>'s and your Country's Friend!</L>
<L>You love a Verse, take such as I can send.</L>
<L><NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Si quis fortè, &amp;c.</NOTE> A Frenchman comes, presents you with his Boy,</L>
<L>Bows and begins.—"This Lad, Sir, is of Blois:</L>
<L>"Observe his Shape how clean! his Locks how curl'd!</L>
<L>"My only Son, I'd have him see the World:</L>
<L>"His French is pure; his Voice too—you shall hear—</L>
<L>"Sir, he's your Slave, for twenty pound a year.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
"Mere Wax as yet, you fashion him with ease,</L>
<L>"Your Barber, Cook, Upholst'rer, what you please.</L>
<L>"A perfect Genius at an Opera-Song—</L>
<L>"To say too much, might do my Honour wrong:</L>
<L>"Take him with all his Virtues, on my word;</L>
<L>"His whole Ambition was to serve a Lord,</L>
<L>"But Sir, to you, with what wou'd I not part?</L>
<L>"Tho' faith, I fear 'twill break his Mother's heart.</L>
<L>"Once, (and but once) I caught him in a Lye,</L>
<L>"And then, unwhipp'd, he had the grace to cry:</L>
<L>"The Fault he has I fairly shall reveal,</L>
<L>"(Cou'd you o'erlook but that)—it is," to steal.</L>
<L><NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Ille ferat pretium, &amp;c.</NOTE> If, after this, you took the graceless Lad,</L>
<L>Cou'd you complain, my Friend, he prov'd so bad?</L>
<L>Faith, in such case, if you should prosecute,</L>
<L>I think Sir Godfry should decide the Suit;</L>
<L>Who sent the Thief who stole the Cash, away,</L>
<L>And punish'd him that put it in his way.</L>
<L><NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Dixi me pigrum, &amp;c.</NOTE> Consider then, and judge me in this light;</L>
<L>I told you when I went, I could not write;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
You said the same; and are you discontent</L>
<L>With Laws, to which you gave your own assent?</L>
<L>Nay worse, to ask for Verse at such a time!</L>
<L>D'ye think me good for nothing but to rhime?</L>
<L><NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Luculli miles, &amp;c.</NOTE> In ANNA'S Wars, a Soldier poor and old,</L>
<L>Had dearly earn'd a little purse of Gold:</L>
<L>Tir'd with a tedious March, one luckless night,</L>
<L>He slept, poor Dog! and lost it, to a doit.</L>
<L>This put the Man in such a desp'rate Mind,</L>
<L>Between Revenge, and Grief, and Hunger join'd,</L>
<L>Against the Foe, himself, and all Mankind,</L>
<L>He leapt the Trenches, scal'd a Castle-Wall,</L>
<L>Tore down a Standard, took the Fort and all.</L>
<L>"Prodigious well!" his great Commander cry'd,</L>
<L>Gave him much Praise, and some Reward beside.</L>
<L>Next pleas'd his Excellence a Town to batter;</L>
<L>(Its Name I know not, and it's no great matter)</L>
<L>"Go on, my Friend (he cry'd) see yonder Walls!</L>
<L>"Advance and conquer! go where Glory calls!</L>
<L>"More Honours, more Rewards, attend the Brave"—</L>
<L>Don't you remember what Reply he gave?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
"D'ye think me, noble Gen'ral, such a Sot?</L>
<L>"Let him take Castles who has ne'er a Groat."</L>
<L><NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Romae nutriri mihi contigit, &amp;c.</NOTE> Bred up at home, full early I begun</L>
<L>To read in Greek, the Wrath of Peleus' Son.</L>
<L>Besides, my Father taught me from a Lad,</L>
<L>The better Art to know the good from bad:</L>
<L>(And little sure imported to remove,</L>
<L>To hunt for Truth in <HI>Maudlin</HI>'s learned Grove.)</L>
<L>But knottier Points we knew not half so well,</L>
<L>Depriv'd us soon of our Paternal Cell;</L>
<L>And certain Laws, by Suff'rers thought unjust,</L>
<L>Deny'd all Posts of Profit or of Trust:</L>
<L>Hopes after Hopes of pious Papists fail'd,</L>
<L>While mighty WILLIAM'S thundring Arm prevail'd.</L>
<L>For Right Hereditary tax'd and fin'd,</L>
<L>He stuck to Poverty with Peace of Mind;</L>
<L>And me, the Muses help'd to undergo it;</L>
<L>Convict a Papist He, and I a Poet.</L>
<L>But (thanks to <HI>Homer)</HI> since I live and thrive,</L>
<L>Indebted to no Prince or Peer alive,</L>

Sure I should want the Care of ten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>MONROE,</HI> Physician to Bedlam Hospital.</NOTE> <HI>Monroes,</HI></L>

<L><NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Singula de nobis anni, &amp;c.</NOTE> Years foll'wing Years, steal something ev'ry day,</L>
<L>At last they steal us from our selves away;</L>
<L>In one our Frolicks, one Amusements end,</L>
<L>In one a Mistress drops, in one a Friend:</L>
<L>This subtle Thief of Life, this paltry Time,</L>
<L>What will it leave me, if it snatch my Rhime?</L>
<L>If ev'ry Wheel of that unweary'd Mill</L>
<L>That turn'd ten thousand Verses, now stands still.</L>
<L><NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Denique non omnes, &amp;c.</NOTE> But after all, what wou'd you have me do?</L>
<L>When out of twenty I can please not two;</L>
<L>When this Heroicks only deigns to praise,</L>
<L>Sharp Satire that, and that Pindaric lays?</L>
<L>One likes the Pheasant's wing, and one the leg;</L>
<L>The Vulgar boil, the Learned roast an Egg;</L>
<L>Hard Task! to hit the Palate of such Guests,</L>
<L>When Oldfield loves, what Dar—n—f detests.</L>
<L><NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Praeter caetera, me Romae-ne, &amp;c.</NOTE> But grant I may relapse, for want of Grace,</L>
<L>Again to rhime, can <HI>London</HI> be the Place?</L>

Who there his Muse, or Self, or Soul attends?</L>
<L>In Croúds and Courts, Law, Business, Feasts and Friends?</L>
<L>My Counsel sends to execute a Deed:</L>
<L>A Poet begs me, I will hear him read:</L>
<L>In Palace-Yard at Nine you'll find me there—</L>
<L>At Ten for certain, Sir, in Bloomsb'ry-Square—</L>
<L>Before the Lords at Twelve my Cause comes on—</L>
<L>There's a Rehearsal, Sir, exact at One.—</L>
<L>"Oh but a Wit can study in the Streets,</L>
<L>"And raise his Mind above the Mob he meets."</L>
<L>Not quite so well however as one ought;</L>
<L>A Hackney-Coach may chance to spoil a Thought,</L>
<L>And then a nodding Beam, or Pig of Lead,</L>
<L>God knows, may hurt the very ablest Head.</L>
<L>Have you not seen at Guild-hall's narrow Pass,</L>
<L>Two Aldermen dispute it with an Ass?</L>
<L>And Peers give way, exalted as they are,</L>
<L>Ev'n to their own S-r-v—nce in a Carr?</L>
<L><NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Inunc, &amp; versus, &amp;c.</NOTE>Go, lofty Poet! and in such a Croud,</L>
<L>Sing thy sonorous Verse—but not aloud.</L>

Alas! to Grotto's and to Groves we run,</L>
<L>To Ease and Silence, ev'ry Muse's Son:</L>

<L>Would drink and doze at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two Villages within 3 or 4 Miles of London.</NOTE> <HI>Tooting</HI> or <HI>Earl's-Court.</HI></L>
<L>How shall I rhime in this eternal Roar?</L>
<L>How match the Bards whom none e'er match'd before?</L>
<L>The Man, who stretch'd in Isis' calm Retreat</L>
<L>To Books and Study gives sev'n years compleat,</L>
<L>See! strow'd with learned dust, his Night-cap on,</L>
<L>He walks, an Object new beneath the Sun!</L>
<L>The Boys flock round him, and the People stare:</L>
<L>So stiff, so mute! some Statue, you would swear,</L>
<L>Stept srom its Pedestal to take the Air.</L>
<L>And here, while Town, and Court, and City roars,</L>
<L>With Mobs, and Duns, and Soldiers, at their doors;</L>
<L>Shall I, in <HI>London,</HI> act this idle part?</L>
<L>Composing Songs, for Fools to get by heart?</L>

<L>And shook his head at <HI>M—y,</HI> as a Wit.</L>
<L>'Twas,"Sir your Law"—and"Sir, your Eloquence"—</L>
<L>"Yours <HI>Cooper</HI>'s Manner—and yours <HI>Talbot</HI>'s Sense."</L>

<L><NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Multa fero, ut placeam, &amp;c.</NOTE> Much do I suffer, much, to keep in peace</L>
<L>This jealous, waspish, wrong-head, rhiming Race;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
And much must flatter, if the Whim should bite</L>
<L>To seek applause by printing what I write:</L>
<L>But let the Fit pass o'er, I'm wise enough,</L>

<L>The Men, who write such Verse as we can read?</L>
<L>Their own strict Judges, not a word they spare</L>
<L>That wants or Force, or Light, or Weight, or Care,</L>
<L>Howe'er unwillingly it quits its place,</L>
<L>Nay tho' at Court (perhaps) it may find grace:</L>

In all but this, a man of sober Life,</L>
<L>Fond of his Friend, and civil to his Wife,</L>

<L>Wisdom (curse on it) will come soon or late.</L>
<L>There is a time when Poets will grow dull:</L>
<L>I'll e'en leave Verses to the Boys at school:</L>
<L>To Rules of Poetry no more confin'd,</L>
<L>I learn to smooth and harmonize my Mind,</L>
<L>Teach ev'ry Thought within its bounds to roll,</L>

Thoughts, which at Hyde-Park-Corner I forgot,</L>

<L>The Heart resolves this matter in a trice,</L>
<L>"Men only feel the Smart, but not the Vice."</L>
<L><NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Si vulnus tibi, &amp;c.</NOTE> When golden Angels cease to cure the Evil,</L>

<L>Yet still, not heeding what your Heart can teach,</L>
