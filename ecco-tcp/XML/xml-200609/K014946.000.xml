<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO Sir RICHARD TEMPLE, Lord COBHAM.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT. Of the Knowlege and Characters of MEN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it is not sufficient for this knowlege to consi∣der man in the <HI>abstract: books</HI> will not serve the purpose, nor yet our own <HI>experience</HI> singly, <HI>v. 1.</HI> General maxims, unless they be formed upon <HI>both,</HI> will be but notional, <HI>v. 10.</HI> Some peculiarity in every man, characteristic to himself, yet vary∣ing from himself, <HI>v. 15.</HI> Difficulties arising from our own passions, fancies, faculties, <HI>etc. v. 31.</HI> The shortness of life, to observe in, and the un∣certainty of the <HI>principles of action</HI> in men, to observe by, <HI>v. 37, etc.</HI> Our <HI>own</HI> principle of a∣ction often hid from ourselves, <HI>v. 41.</HI> Some few characters plain, but in general confounded, dis∣sembled, or inconsistent, <HI>v. 51.</HI> The same man
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
utterly different in different places and seasons, <HI>v. 71.</HI> Unimaginable weaknesses in the great∣est, <HI>v. 70, etc.</HI> Nothing constant and certain but God and Nature, <HI>v. 95.</HI> No judging of the <HI>motives</HI> from the actions; the same actions proceeding from contrary motives, and the same motives influencing contrary actions, <HI>v. 100. II.</HI> Yet to form <HI>characters,</HI> we can only take the <HI>strongest actions</HI> of a man's life, and try to make them <HI>agree:</HI> the utter uncertainty of this, from <HI>nature</HI> itself, and from <HI>policy, v. 120. Characters</HI> given according to the <HI>rank</HI> of men of the world, <HI>v. 135.</HI> And some reason for it, <HI>v. 140. Educa∣tion</HI> alters the <HI>nature,</HI> or at least <HI>character,</HI> of many, <HI>v. 149. Actions, passions, opinions, man∣ners, humours,</HI> or <HI>principles,</HI> all subject to change. No judging by <HI>nature,</HI> from <HI>v. 158</HI> to <HI>178. III.</HI> It only remains to find (if we can) his <HI>RULING PASSION:</HI> that will certainly influence all the rest, and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsisten∣cy of all his actions, <HI>v. 175.</HI> Instanced in the ex∣traordinary character of <HI>Clodio, v. 179.</HI> A cau∣tion against mistaking <HI>second qualities</HI> for <HI>first,</HI> which will destroy all possibility of the knowlege of mankind, <HI>v. 210.</HI> Examples of the strength of the <HI>ruling passion,</HI> and its continuation to the last breath, <HI>v. 222, etc.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD><PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y"/>EPISTLE I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YES, you despise the man to books confin'd,</L>
<L>Who from his study rails at human kind;</L>
<L>Tho' what he learns he speaks, and may advance</L>
<L>Some gen'ral maxims, or be right by chance.</L>
<L N="5">The coxcomb bird, so talkative and grave,</L>
<L>That from his cage cries cuckold, whore, and knave,</L>
<L>Tho' many a passenger he rightly call,</L>
<L>You hold him no philosopher at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet the fate of all extremes is such,</L>
<L N="10">Men may be read, as well as books, too much.</L>
<L>To observations which ourselves we make,</L>
<L>We grow more partial for th' observer's sake;</L>
<L>To written wisdom, as another's, less:</L>
<L>Maxims are drawn from notions, those from guess.</L>
<L N="15">There's some peculiar in each leaf and grain,</L>
<L>Some unmark'd fibre, or some varying vein:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
Shall only man be taken in the gross?</L>
<L>Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That each from other differs, first confess;</L>
<L N="20">Next, that he varies from himself no less:</L>
<L>Add nature's, custom's, reason's, passion's strife,</L>
<L>And all opinion's colours cast on life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our depths who fathoms, or our shallows finds,</L>
<L>Quick whirls, and shifting eddies, of our minds?</L>
<L N="25">On human actions reason tho' you can,</L>
<L>It may be reason, but it is not man:</L>
<L>His principle of action once explore,</L>
<L>That instant 'tis his principle no more.</L>
<L>Like following life thro' creatures you dissect,</L>
<L N="30">You lose it in the moment you detect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more; the diff'rence is as great between</L>
<L>The optics seeing, as the objects seen.</L>
<L>All manners take a tincture from our own;</L>
<L>Or come discolour'd thro' our passions shown.</L>
<L N="35">Or fancy's beam enlarges, multiplies,</L>
<L>Contracts, inverts, and gives ten thousand dyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>Nor will life's stream for observation stay,</L>
<L>It hurries all too fast to mark their way:</L>
<L>In vain sedate reflections we would make,</L>
<L>When half our knowlege we must snatch, not take.</L>
<L N="41">Oft, in the passions' wild rotation tost,</L>
<L>Our spring of action to ourselves is lost:</L>
<L>Tir'd, not determin'd, to the last we yield,</L>
<L>And what comes then is master of the field.</L>
<L N="45">As the last image of that troubled heap,</L>
<L>When sense subsides, and fancy sports in sleep,</L>
<L>(Tho' past the recollection of the thought)</L>
<L>Becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought:</L>
<L>Something as dim to our internal view,</L>
<L N="50">Is thus, perhaps, the cause of most we do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True, some are open, and to all men known;</L>
<L>Others so very close, they're hid from none;</L>
<L>(So darkness strikes the sense no less than light)</L>
<L>Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at sight;</L>
<L N="55">And ev'ry child hates Shylock, tho' his soul</L>
<L>Still sits at squat, and peeps not from its hole.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8"/>
At half mankind when gen'rous Manly raves,</L>
<L>All know 'tis virtue, for he thinks them knaves:</L>
<L>When universal homage Umbra pays,</L>
<L N="60">All see 'tis vice, and itch of vulgar praise.</L>
<L>When flatt'ry glares, all hate it in a queen,</L>
<L>While one there is who charms us with his spleen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But these plain characters we rarely find;</L>
<L>Tho' strong the bent, yet quick the turns of mind:</L>
<L N="65">Or puzzling contraries confound the whole;</L>
<L>Or affectations quite reverse the soul.</L>
<L>The dull, flat falshood serves, for policy:</L>
<L>And in the cunning, truth itself's a lye:</L>
<L>Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise;</L>
<L N="70">The fool lies hid in inconsistencies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the same man, in vigour, in the gout;</L>
<L>Alone, in company; in place, or out;</L>
<L>Early at bus'ness, and at hazard late;</L>
<L>Mad at a fox-chace, wise at a debate;</L>
<L N="75">Drunk at a borough, civil at a ball;</L>
<L>Friendly at Hackney, faithless at Whitehall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
<L>Catius is ever moral, ever grave,</L>
<L>Thinks who endures a knave, is next a knave,</L>
<L>Save just at dinner—then prefers, no doubt,</L>
<L N="80">A rogue with ven'son to a saint without.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who would not praise Patritio's high desert,</L>
<L>His hand unstain'd, his uncorrupted heart,</L>
<L>His comprehensive head! all int'rests weigh'd,</L>
<L>All Europe sav'd, yet Britain not betray'd.</L>
<L N="85">He thanks you not, his pride is in picquette,</L>
<L>New-market-fame, and judgment at a bett.<PTR TARGET="CN026683.EP1V86"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What made, (say Montagne, or more sage Char∣ron!)</L>
<L>Otho a warrior, Cromwell a buffoon?</L>
<L>A perjur'd prince a leaden saint revere,<NOTE PLACE="foot">VER. 89.—<HI>A perjur'd prince</HI>] Louis XI. of France wore in his hat a leaden image of the Virgin Mary, which when he swore by, he feared to break his oath.</NOTE></L>
<L N="90">A godless regent tremble at a star?</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10" MS="y"/>
The throne a bigot keep, a genius quit,<NOTE PLACE="foot">VER. 91. <HI>The throne a bigot keep, a genius quit,</HI>] Philip V. of Spain, who, after renouncing the throne for religion, resumed it to gratify his queen; and Victor Amadeus II. king of Sardinia, who resigned the crown, and trying to reassume it, was imprison∣ed till his death.</NOTE></L>
<L>Faithless thro' piety, and dup'd thro' wit?</L>
<L>Europe a woman, child, or dotard rule,</L>
<L>And just her wisest monarch made a fool?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="95">Know GOD and NATURE only are the same:</L>
<L>In man, the judgment shoots at flying game;</L>
<L>A bird of passage! gone as soon as found,</L>
<L>Now in the moon perhaps, now under ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the sage, with retrospective eye,</L>
<L>Would from th' apparent what conclude the why,</L>
<L N="101">Infer the motive from the deed, and shew</L>
<L>That what we chanc'd was what we meant to do.</L>
<L>Behold! if fortune or a mistress frowns,</L>
<L>Some plunge in bus'ness, others shave their crowns:</L>
<L N="105"><PB N="11" REF="11"/>
To ease the soul of one oppressive weight,</L>
<L>This quits an empire, that embroils a state:</L>
<L>The same adust complexion has impell'd</L>
<L>Charles to the convent, Philip to the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not always actions shew the man: we find</L>
<L N="110">Who does a kindness, is not therefore kind;</L>
<L>Perhaps prosperity becalm'd his breast,</L>
<L>Perhaps the wind just shifted from the east:</L>
<L>Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat,</L>
<L>Pride guides his steps, and bids him shun the great:</L>
<L N="115">Who combats bravely is not therefore brave,</L>
<L>He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave:</L>
<L>Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise,</L>
<L>His pride in reas'ning, not in acting lies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But grant that actions best discover man;</L>
<L>Take the most strong, and sort them as you can.</L>
<L N="121">The few that glare, each character must mark,</L>
<L>You balance not the many in the dark.</L>
<L>What will you do with such as disagree?</L>
<L>Suppress them, or miscall them policy?</L>
<L N="125"><PB N="12" REF="12"/>
Must then at once (the character to save)</L>
<L>The plain rough hero turn a crafty knave?</L>
<L>Alas! in truth the man but chang'd his mind,</L>
<L>Perhaps was sick, in love, or had not din'd.</L>
<L>Ask why from Britain Caesar would retreat?<PTR TARGET="CN026683.EP1V129"/></L>
<L N="130">Caesar himself might whisper he was beat.</L>
<L>Why risk the world's great empire for a punk?</L>
<L>Caesar perhaps might answer he was drunk.</L>
<L>But, sage historians! 'tis your task to prove</L>
<L>One action conduct; one, heroic love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis from high life high characters are drawn:</L>
<L N="136">A saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn;</L>
<L>A judge is just, a chanc'lor juster still;</L>
<L>A gownman, learn'd; a bishop, what you will;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13" MS="y"/>
Wise, if a minister; but, if a king,</L>
<L>More wise, more learn'd, more just, more ev'ry thing.</L>
<L N="141">Court-virtues bear, like gems, the highest rate,</L>
<L>Born where heav'n's influence scarce can penetrate:</L>
<L>In life's low vale, the soil the virtues like,</L>
<L>They please as beauties, here as wonders strike.</L>
<L N="145">Tho' the same sun with all-diffusive rays</L>
<L>Blush in the rose, and in the di'mond blaze,</L>
<L>We prize the stronger effort of his pow'r,</L>
<L>And justly set the gem above the flow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis education forms the common mind,</L>
<L N="150">Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclin'd.</L>
<L>Boastful and rough, your first son is a 'squire;</L>
<L>The next a tradesman, meek, and much a lyar;</L>
<L>Tom struts a soldier, open, bold, and brave;</L>
<L N="154">Will sneaks a scriv'ner, an exceeding knave:</L>
<L>Is he a churchman? then he's fond of pow'r:</L>

<L N="160">Strike off his pension, by the setting sun,</L>
<L>And Britain, if not Europe, is undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That gay free-thinker, a fine talker once,</L>
<L>What turns him now a stupid silent dunce?</L>
<L>Some God or Spirit he has lately found;</L>
<L N="165">Or chanc'd to meet a minister that frown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Judge we by nature? Habit can efface,</L>
<L>Int'rest o'ercome, or policy take place:</L>
<L>By actions? those uncertainty divides:</L>
<L>By passions? these dissimulation hides:</L>
<L N="170">Opinions? they still take a wider range:</L>
<L>Find if you can, in what you cannot change.</L>
<L>Manners with fortunes, humours turn with climes,</L>
<L>Tenets with books, and principles with times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Search then the RULING PASSION: there, alone,</L>
<L>The wild are constant, and the cunning known;</L>
<L N="176">The fool consistent, and the false sincere;</L>
<L>Priests, princes, women, no dissemblers here.</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="15"/>
This clue, once found, unravels all the rest,</L>
<L>The prospect clears, and Wharton stands confest.</L>
<L N="180">Wharton, the scorn and wonder of our days,</L>
<L>Whose ruling passion was the lust of praise:</L>
<L>Born with whate'er could win it from the wise,</L>
<L>Women and fools must like him or he dies;</L>
<L>Tho' wond'ring senates hung on all he spoke,</L>
<L N="185">The club must hail him master of the joke.</L>
<L>Shall parts so various aim at nothing new?</L>
<L>He'll shine a Tully and a Wilmot too.<NOTE PLACE="foot">VER. 187. John Wilmot, E. of Rochester, famous for his wit and extravagancies in the time of Charles the second.</NOTE></L>
<L>Then turns repentant, and his God adores</L>
<L>With the same spirit that he drinks and whores;</L>
<L N="190">Enough if all around him but admire,</L>
<L>And now the punk applaud, and now the fryer.</L>
<L>Thus with each gift of nature and of art,</L>
<L>And wanting nothing but an honest heart;</L>
<L>Grown all to all, from no one vice exempt;</L>
<L N="195">And most contemptible, to shun contempt;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16" MS="y"/>
His passion still, to covet gen'ral praise,</L>
<L>His life, to forfeit it a thousand ways;</L>
<L>A constant bounty which no friend has made;</L>
<L>An angel tongue, which no man can persuade;</L>
<L N="200">A fool with more of wit than half mankind,</L>
<L>Too rash for thought, for action too refin'd:</L>
<L>A tyrant to the wife her heart approves;</L>
<L>A rebel to the very king he loves;</L>
<L>He dies, sad out-cast of each church and state,</L>
<L N="205">And, harder still! flagitious, yet not great.</L>
<L>Ask you why Wharton broke thro' ev'ry rule?</L>
<L>'Twas all for fear the knaves should call him fool.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature well known, no prodigies remain,<PTR TARGET="CN026683.EP1V208"/></L>
<L>Comets are regular, and Wharton plain.</L>

<L>If second qualities for first they take.</L>

When Catiline by rapine swell'd his store;</L>
<L>When Caesar made a noble dame a whore;</L>
<L>In this the lust, in that the avarice,</L>

<L>That very Caesar, born in Scipio's days,</L>
<L>Had aim'd, like him, by chastity at praise.</L>
<L>Lucullus, when frugality could charm,</L>
<L>Had roasted turnips in the Sabin farm.</L>
<L N="220">In vain th' observer eyes the builder's toil,</L>

<L>In this one passion man can strength enjoy,</L>

<L>Time, that on all things lays his lenient hand,</L>

He justified him∣self upon that article in a letter to the earl of Burlington; at the end of which are these words: <Q REND="inline">"I have learnt that there are some who would rather be wicked than ridiculous; and therefore it may be safer to attack vices than follies. I will therefore leave my betters in the quiet possession of their idols, their groves, and their high places, and change my subject from their pride to their meanness, from their vanities to their miseries; and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions, to lessen offence, and not to multiply ill-natured applications, I may probably, in my next, make use of real names instead of ficti∣tious ones."</Q></NOTE></HEAD>

JOHN WARD of Hackney, Esq. member of parlia∣ment, being prosecuted by the duchess of Buckingham, and con∣victed of forgery, was first expelled the house, and then stood on the pillory on the 17th of March 1727. He was suspected of joining in a conveyance with Sir John Blunt, to secrete fifty thousand pounds of that director's estate, forfeited to the south-sea com∣pany by act of parliament. The company recovered the fifty thousand pounds against Ward; but he set up prior conveyances of his real estate to his brother and son, and concealed all his per∣sonal, which was computed to be one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. These conveyances being also set aside by a bill in Chancery, Ward was imprisoned, and hazarded the forfeiture of his life, by not giving in his effects till the last day, which was that of his examination. During his confinement, his amusement was to give poison to dogs and cats, and see them expire by slow∣er or quicker torments. To sum up the <HI>worth</HI> of this gentleman, at the several aeras of his life; at his standing in the pillory he was <HI>worth above two hundred thousand pounds;</HI> at his commitment to prison, he was <HI>worth one hundred and fifty thousand;</HI> but has been since so far diminished in his reputation, as to be thought a <HI>worse man</HI> by <HI>fifty or sixty thousand.</HI></P>
<P>FR. CHARTRES, a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next banished Brussels, and drum∣med out of Ghent on the same account. After a hundred tricks at the gaming-tables, he took to lending of money at exorbitant interest and on great penalties, accumulating premium, interest, and capital into a new capital, and seizing to a minute when the payments became due; in a word, by a constant attention to the vices, wants, and follies of mankind, he acquired an immense for∣tune. His house was a perpetual bawdy-house. He was twice con∣demned for rapes, and pardoned; but the last time not without imprisonment in Newgate, and large confiscations. He died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The populace at his funeral raised a great riot, almost tore the body out of the coffin, and cast dead dogs, <HI>etc.</HI> into the grave along with it. The following epitaph contains his character very justly drawn by Dr. Arbuthnot:<Q><L>HERE continueth to rot</L><L>The body of FRANCIS CHARTRES,</L>
