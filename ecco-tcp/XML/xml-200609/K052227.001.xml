<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOMER is universally allow'd to have had the greatest Invention of any Writer whatever. The Praise of Judgment <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> has justly contested with him, and others may have their Pretensions as to particular Excellencies; but his Invention remains yet unrival'd. Nor is it a Wonder if he has ever been acknowledg'd the greatest of Poets, who most excell'd in That which is the very Foundation of Poetry. It is the Inven∣tion that in different degrees distinguishes all great Genius's: The utmost Stretch of hu∣man Study, Learning, and Industry, which ma∣sters every thing besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes Art with all her Materials, and without it Judgment itself can at best but <HI>steal wisely:</HI> For Art is only like a prudent Steward that lives on managing the Riches of Nature. Whatever Praises may be given to Works of Judgment, there is not even a single Beauty in them but is owing to the Invention: As in the most regular Gardens, however Art may carry the greatest Appearance, there is not
<PB REF="4"/>
a Plant or Flower but is the Gift of Nature. The first can only reduce the Beauties of the latter into a more obvious Figure, which the common Eye may better take in, and is therefore more entertain'd with. And perhaps the reason why most Criticks are inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical Genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their Observations through an uniform and bounded Walk of Art, than to comprehend the vast and various Extent of Nature.</P>
<P>Our Author's Work is a wild Paradise, where if we cannot see all the Beauties so distinctly as in an order'd Garden, it is only because the Num∣ber of them is infinitely greater. 'Tis like a co∣pious Nursery which contains the Seeds and first Productions of every kind, out of which those who follow'd him have but selected some parti∣cular Plants, each according to his Fancy, to cul∣tivate and beautify. If some things are too luxu∣riant, it is owing to the Richness of the Soil; and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or Ma∣turity, it is only because they are over-run and opprest by those of a stronger Nature.</P>
<P>It is to the Strength of this amazing Inven∣tion we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and Rapture, which is so forcible in <HI>Homer,</HI> that no Man of a true Poetical Spirit is Master of him∣self while he reads him. What he writes is of the most animated Nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in
<PB REF="5"/>
Action. If a Council be call'd, or a Battel fought, you are not coldly inform'd of what was said or done as from a third Person; the Reader is hur∣ry'd out of himself by the Force of the Poet's Imagination, and turns in one place to a Hearer, in another to a Spectator. The Course of his Verses resembles that of the Army he describes,<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q> <HI>They pour along like a Fire that sweeps the whole Earth before it.</HI> 'Tis however remarkable that his Fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not discover'd immediately at the beginning of his Poem in its fullest Splendor: It grows in the Progress both upon himself and others, and be∣comes on Fire like a Chariot-Wheel, by its own Rapidity. Exact Disposition, just Thought, cor∣rect Elocution, polish'd Numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this Poetical <HI>Fire,</HI> this <HI>Vivida vis animi,</HI> in a very few. Even in Works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can over-power Criticism, and make us admire even while we dis-approve. Nay, where this appears, tho' attended with Absurdities, it brigh∣tens all the Rubbish about it, 'till we see nothing but its own Splendor. This <HI>Fire</HI> is discern'd in <HI>Virgil,</HI> but discern'd as through a Glass, refle∣cted, and more shining than warm, but every where equal and constant: In <HI>Lucan</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted Flashes: In <HI>Milton,</HI> it glows like a Furnace kept
<PB REF="6"/>
up to an uncommon Fierceness by the Force of Art: In <HI>Shakespear,</HI> it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental Fire from Heaven: But in <HI>Homer,</HI> and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irresistibly.</P>
<P>I shall here endeavour to show, how this vast <HI>Invention</HI> exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any Poet, thro' all the main constituent Parts of his Work, as it is the great and peculiar Cha∣racteristick which distinguishes him from all other Authors.</P>
<P>This strong and ruling Faculty was like a powerful Planet, which in the Violence of its Course, drew all things within its <HI>Vortex.</HI> It seem'd not enough to have taken in the whole Circle of Arts, and the whole Compass of Na∣ture; all the inward Passions and Affections of Mankind to supply this Characters, and all the outward Forms and Images of Things for his Descriptions; but wanting yet an ampler Sphere to expatiate in, he open'd a new and boundless Walk for his Imagination, and created a World for himself in the Invention of <HI>Fable.</HI> That which <HI>Aristotle</HI> calls the <HI>Soul of Poetry,</HI> was first breath'd into it by <HI>Homer.</HI> I shall begin with considering him in this Part, as it is naturally the first, and I speak of it both as it means the Design of a Poem, and as it is taken for Fiction.</P>
<P>Fable may be divided into the <HI>Probable,</HI> the <HI>Allegorical,</HI> and the <HI>Marvelous.</HI> The <HI>Probable</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Fable</HI> is the Recital of such Actions as tho' they did not happen, yet might, in the com∣mon course of Nature: Or of such as tho' they did, become Fables by the additional Episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main Story of an Epic Poem, <HI>the Return of</HI> Ulysses, <HI>the Settlement of the</HI> Trojans <HI>in</HI> Italy, or the like. That of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is <HI>the Anger of</HI> Achilles, the most short and single Subject that ever was chosen by any Poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster Variety of In∣cidents and Events, and crouded with a greater Number of Councils, Speeches, Battles, and Epi∣sodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those Poems whose Schemes are of the utmost Latitude and Irregularity. The Action is hurry'd on with the most vehement Spirit, and its whole Duration employs not so much as fifty Days. <HI>Virgil,</HI> for want of so warm a Genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive Subject, as well as a greater Length of Time, and con∣tracting the Design of both <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic Poets have us'd the same Practice, but generally carry'd it so far as to superinduce a Multiplicity of Fables, destroy the Unity of Action, and lose their Readers in an unreasonable Length of Time. Nor is it only in the main Design that they have been unable to add to his Invention, but they have follow'd him in every Episode and Part of Story. If he has
<PB REF="8"/>
given a regular <HI>Catalogue</HI> of an <HI>Army,</HI> they all draw up their Forces in the same Order. If he has funeral Games for <HI>Patroclus, Virgil</HI> has the same for <HI>Anchises,</HI> and <HI>Statius</HI> (rather than omit them) destroys the Unity of his Action for those of <HI>Archemorus.</HI> If <HI>Ulysses</HI> visit the Shades, the <HI>Aeneas</HI> of <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Scipio</HI> of <HI>Silius</HI> are sent after him. If he be detain'd from his Return by the Allurements of <HI>Calypso,</HI> so is <HI>Aeneas</HI> by <HI>Dido,</HI> and <HI>Rinaldo</HI> by <HI>Armida.</HI> If <HI>Achilles</HI> be absent from the Army on the Score of a Quarrel thro' half the Poem, <HI>Rinaldo</HI> must absent him∣self just as long, on the like account. If he gives his Heroe a Suit of celestial Armour, <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> and <HI>Tasso</HI> make the same Present to theirs. <HI>Virgil</HI> has not only observ'd this close Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> but where he had not led the way, supply'd the Want from other <HI>Greek</HI> Authors. Thus the Story of <HI>Sinon</HI> and the <HI>Taking of Troy</HI> was copied (says <HI>Macrobius</HI>) almost word for word from <HI>Pisander,</HI> as the Loves of <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> are taken from those of <HI>Medaea</HI> and <HI>Jason</HI> in <HI>Apollonius,</HI> and several others in the same manner.</P>
<P>To proceed to the <HI>Allegorical Fable:</HI> If we reflect upon those innumerable Knowledges, those Secrets of Nature and Physical Philosophy which <HI>Homer</HI> is generally suppos'd to have wrapt up in his <HI>Allegories,</HI> what a new and ample Scene of Wonder may this Consideration afford us? How fertile will that Imagination appear, which was
<PB REF="9"/>
able to cloath all the Properties of Elements, the Qualifications of the Mind, the Virtues and Vices, in Forms and Persons; and to introduce them into Actions agreeable to the Nature of the Things they shadow'd? This is a Field in which no suc∣ceeding Poets could dispute with <HI>Homer;</HI> and whatever Commendations have been allow'd them on this Head, are by no means for their Invention in having enlarg'd his Circle, but for their Judg∣ment in having contracted it. For when the Mode of Learning chang'd in following Ages, and Science was deliver'd in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern Poets to lay it aside, as it was in <HI>Homer</HI> to make use of it. And perhaps it was no un∣happy Circumstance for <HI>Virgil,</HI> that there was not in his Time that Demand upon him of so great an Invention, as might be capable of fur∣nishing all those Allegorical Parts of a Poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marvelous Fable</HI> includes whatever is su∣pernatural, and especially the Machines of the Gods. If <HI>Homer</HI> was not the first who introduc'd the Deities (as <HI>Herodotus</HI> imagines) into the Re∣ligion of <HI>Greece,</HI> he seems the first who brought them into a System of <HI>Machinery</HI> for Poetry, and such an one as makes its greatest Importance and Dignity. For we find those Authors who have been offended at the literal Notion of the Gods, constantly laying their Accusation against <HI>Homer</HI> as the undoubted Inventor of them. But whatever cause there might be to blame his <HI>Ma∣chines</HI>
<PB REF="10"/>
in a Philosophical or Religious View, they are so perfect in the Poetick, that Mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: None have been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Limits he has set: Every Attempt of this Nature has prov'd unsuccessful; and after all the various Changes of Times and Religions, his Gods continue to this Day the Gods of Poetry.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Characters</HI> of his Persons, and here we shall find no Author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprizing a Variety, or given us such lively and affecting Impressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his own, that no Painter could have distinguish'd them more by their Features, than the Poet has by their Manners. Nothing can be more exact than the Distinctions he has observ'd in the diffe∣rent degrees of Virtues and Vices. The single Quality of <HI>Courage</HI> is wonderfully diversify'd in the several Characters of the <HI>Iliad.</HI> That of <HI>Achilles</HI> is furious and intractable; that of <HI>Diomede</HI> forward, yet listening to Advice and subject to Command: We see in <HI>Ajax</HI> an heavy and self∣considering Valour, in <HI>Hector</HI> an active and vigi∣lant one: The Courage of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> is inspi∣rited by Love of Empire and Ambition, that of <HI>Menelaus</HI> mix'd with Softness and Tenderness for his People: We find in <HI>Idomeneus</HI> a plain direct Soldier, in <HI>Sarpedon</HI> a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing Diversity to
<PB REF="11"/>
be found only in the principal Quality which con∣stitutes the Main of each Character, but even in the Under-parts of it, to which he takes care to give a Tincture of that principal one. For Ex∣ample, the main Characters of <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Nestor</HI> consist in <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and they are distinct in this; the Wisdom of one is <HI>artificial</HI> and <HI>various,</HI> of the other <HI>natural, open,</HI> and <HI>regular.</HI> But they have, besides, Characters of <HI>Courage;</HI> and this Quality also takes a different Turn in each from the dif∣ference of his Prudence: For one in the War de∣pends still upon <HI>Caution,</HI> the other upon <HI>Expe∣rience.</HI> It would be endless to produce Instances of these Kinds. The Characters of <HI>Virgil</HI> are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguish'd, and where they are mark'd most evidently, affect us not in proportion to those of <HI>Homer.</HI> His Cha∣racters of Valour are much alike; even that of <HI>Turnus</HI> seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree; and we see nothing that diffe∣rences the Courage of <HI>Mnestheus</HI> from that of <HI>Ser∣gesthus, Cloanthus,</HI> or the rest. In like manner it may be remark'd of <HI>Statius</HI>'s Heroes, that an Air of Impetuosity runs thro' them all; the same hor∣rid and savage Courage appears in his <HI>Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon,</HI> &amp;c. They have a Parity of Character which makes them seem Brothers of one Family. I believe when the Reader is led into this Track of Reflection, if he will pursue it through the <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> Writers, he will be convinced
<PB REF="12"/>
how infinitely superior in this Point the Invention of <HI>Homer</HI> was to that of all others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Speeches</HI> are to be consider'd as they slow from the Characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the Manners of those who utter them. As there is more variety of Characters in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> so there is of Speeches, than in any other Poem. <HI>Every thing in it has Manners</HI> (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> expresses it) that is, every thing is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible in a Work of such length, how small a Number of Lines are employ'd in Narration. In <HI>Virgil</HI> the Dramatic Part is less in proportion to the Narrative; and the Speeches often consist of ge∣neral Reflections or Thoughts, which might be equally just in any Person's Mouth upon the same Occasion. As many of his Persons have no ap∣parent Characters, so many of his Speeches escape being apply'd and judg'd by the Rule of Propriety. We oftner think of the Author himself when we read <HI>Virgil,</HI> than when we are engag'd in <HI>Homer:</HI> All which are the Effects of a colder Invention, that interests us less in the Action describ'd: <HI>Homer</HI> makes us Hearers, and <HI>Virgil</HI> leaves us Readers.</P>
<P>If in the next place we take a View of the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> the same presiding Faculty is eminent in the Sublimity and Spirit of his Thoughts. <HI>Longinus</HI> has given his Opinion, that it was in this Part <HI>Homer</HI> principally excell'd. What were alone sufficient to prove the Grandeur and Excellence of his Sentiments in general, is that
<PB REF="13"/>
they have so remarkable a Parity with those of the Scripture: <HI>Duport,</HI> in his <HI>Gnomologia Homerica,</HI> has collected innumerable Instances of this sort. And it is with Justice an excellent modern Writer allows, that if <HI>Virgil</HI> has not so many Thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the <HI>Roman</HI> Author seldom rises into very astonishing Senti∣ments where he is not fired by the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>If we observe his <HI>Descriptions, Images,</HI> and <HI>Si∣miles,</HI> we shall find the Invention still predomi∣nant. To what else can we ascribe that vast Comprehension of Images of every sort, where we see each Circumstance and Individual of Na∣ture summon'd together by the Extent and Fe∣cundity of his Imagination; to which all things, in their various Views, presented themselves in an Instant, and had their Impressions taken off to Perfection at a Heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full Prospects of Things, but several un∣expected Peculiarities and Side-Views, unobserv'd by any Painter but <HI>Homer.</HI> Nothing is so sur∣prizing as the Descriptions of his Battels, which take up no less than half the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and are sup∣ply'd with so vast a Variety of Incidents, that no one bears a Likeness to another; such different Kinds of Deaths, that no two Heroes are wounded in the same manner; and such a Profusion of no∣ble Ideas, that every Battel rises above the last in Greatness, Horror, and Confusion. It is certain there is not near that Number of Images and
<PB REF="14"/>
Descriptions in any Epic Poet; tho' every one has assisted himself with a great Quantity out of him: And it is evident of <HI>Virgil</HI> especially, that he has scarce any Comparisons which are not drawn from his Master.</P>
<P>If we descend from hence to the <HI>Expression,</HI> we see the bright Imagination of <HI>Homer</HI> shining out in the most enliven'd Forms of it. We acknow∣ledge him the Father of Poetical Diction, the first who taught that <HI>Language of the Gods</HI> to Men. His Expression is like the colouring of some great Masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with Rapidity. It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imagi∣nable, and touch'd with the greatest Spirit. <HI>Aristotle</HI> had reason to say, He was the only Poet who had found out <HI>Living Words;</HI> there are in him more daring Figures and Metaphors than in any good Author whatever. An Arrow is <HI>impatient</HI> to be on the Wing, a Weapon <HI>thirsts</HI> to drink the Blood of an Enemy, and the like. Yet his Expression is never too big for the Sense, but justly great in proportion to it: 'Tis the Senti∣ment that swells and fills out the Diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it. For in the same degree that a <HI>Thought</HI> is warmer, an <HI>Expression</HI> will be brighter; and as That is more strong, This will become more perspicuous: Like Glass in the Furnace which grows to a greater Magnitude, and refines to a greater Clearness, only as the <HI>Breath</HI> within is more powerful, and the <HI>Heat</HI> more intense.</P>
<P><PB REF="15"/>
To throw his Language more out of Prose, <HI>Homer</HI> seems to have affected the <HI>Compound-Epi∣thets.</HI> This was a sort of Composition peculiarly proper to Poetry, not only as it heighten'd the <HI>Diction,</HI> but as it assisted and fill'd the <HI>Numbers</HI> with greater Sound and Pomp, and likewise con∣duced in some measure to thicken the <HI>Images.</HI> On this last Consideration I cannot but attribute these to the Fruitfulness of his Invention, since (as he has manag'd them) they are a sort of supernu∣merary Pictures of the Persons or Things they are join'd to. We see the Motion of <HI>Hector</HI>'s Plumes in the Epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Landscape of Mount <HI>Neritus</HI> in that of <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and so of others; which particular Images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a Description (tho' but of a single Line) without diverting the Reader too much from the prin∣cipal Action or Figure. As a Metaphor is a short Simile, one of these Epithets is a short Description.</P>
<P>Lastly, if we consider his <HI>Versification,</HI> we shall be sensible what a Share of Praise is due to his Invention in that also. He was not satisfy'd with his Language as he found it settled in any one Part of <HI>Greece,</HI> but search'd thro' its differ∣ing <HI>Dialects</HI> with this particular View, to beau∣tify and perfect his Numbers: He consider'd these as they had a greater Mixture of Vowels or Consonants, and accordingly employ'd them as the Verse requir'd either a greater Smoothness
<PB REF="16"/>
or Strength. What he most affected was the <HI>Ionic,</HI> which has a peculiar Sweetness from its never using Contractions, and from its Custom of resolving the Diphthongs into two Syllables; so as to make the Words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous Fluency. With this he mingled the <HI>Attic</HI> Contractions, the broader <HI>Doric,</HI> and the feebler <HI>Aeolic,</HI> which often rejects its Aspirate, or takes off its Accent; and compleated this Variety by altering some Letters with the License of Poetry. Thus his Measures, instead of being Fetters to his Sense, were always in readi∣ness to run along with the Warmth of his Rap∣ture; and even to give a farther Representation of his Notions, in the Correspondence of their Sounds to what they signify'd. Out of all these he has deriv'd that Harmony, which makes us confess he had not only the richest Head, but the finest Ear in the World. This is so great a Truth, that whoever will but consult the Tune of his Verses even without understanding them (with the same sort of Diligence as we daily see practis'd in the Case of <HI>Italian Opera's</HI>) will find more Sweetness, Variety, and Majesty of Sound, than in any other Language or Poetry. The Beauty of his Numbers is allow'd by the Criticks to be copied but faintly by <HI>Virgil</HI> himself, tho' they are so just to ascribe it to the Nature of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue. Indeed the <HI>Greek</HI> has some Advantages both from the natural <HI>Sound</HI> of its <HI>Words,</HI> and the Turn and <HI>Cadence</HI> of its <HI>Verse,</HI> which agree
<PB REF="17"/>
with the Genius of no other Language. <HI>Virgil</HI> was very sensible of this, and used the utmost Diligence in working up a more intractable Lan∣guage to whatsoever Graces it was capable of, and in particular never fail'd to bring the Sound of his Line to a beautiful Agreement with its Sense. If the <HI>Grecian</HI> Poet has not been so frequently ce∣lebrated on this Account as the <HI>Roman,</HI> the only reason is, that fewer Criticks have understood one Language than the other. <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicar∣nassus</HI> has pointed out many of our Author's Beau∣ties in this kind, in his Treatise of the <HI>Composition of Words,</HI> and others will be taken notice of in the Course of the Notes. It suffices at present to observe of his Numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine <HI>Homer</HI> had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the <HI>Muses</HI> dictated; and at the same time with so much Force and inspiriting Vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the Sound of a Trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful River, always in motion, and always full; while we are born away by a Tide of Verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.</P>
<P>Thus on whatever side we contemplate <HI>Homer,</HI> what principally strikes us is his <HI>Invention.</HI> It is that which forms the Character of each Part of his Work; and accordingly we find it to have made his Fable more <HI>extensive</HI> and <HI>copious</HI> than any other, his Manners more <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>strongly marked,</HI> his Speeches more <HI>affecting</HI> and <HI>transported,</HI>
<PB REF="18"/>
his Sentiments more <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>sublime,</HI> his Ima∣ges and Descriptions more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> his Expression more <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>daring,</HI> and his Numbers more <HI>rapid</HI> and <HI>various.</HI> I hope in what has been said of <HI>Virgil</HI> with regard to any of these Heads, I have no way derogated from his Character. Nothing is more absurd or end∣less, than the common Method of comparing eminent Writers by an Opposition of particular Passages in them, and forming a Judgment from thence of their Merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain Knowledge of the prin∣cipal Character and distinguishing Excellence of each: It is in <HI>that</HI> we are to consider him, and in proportion to his Degree in <HI>that</HI> we are to ad∣mire him. No Author or Man ever excell'd all the World in more than one Faculty, and as <HI>Homer</HI> has done this in Invention, <HI>Virgil</HI> has in Judgment. Not that we are to think <HI>Homer</HI> wanted Judgment, because <HI>Virgil</HI> had it in a more eminent degree; or that <HI>Virgil</HI> wanted In∣vention, because <HI>Homer</HI> possest a larger share of it: Each of these great Authors had more of both than perhaps any Man besides, and are only said to have less in Comparison with one ano∣ther. <HI>Homer</HI> was the greater Genius, <HI>Virgil</HI> the better Artist. In one we most admire the <HI>Man,</HI> in the other the <HI>Work. Homer</HI> hurries and trans∣ports us with a commanding Impetuosity, <HI>Virgil</HI> leads us with an attractive Majesty: <HI>Homer</HI> scatters with a generous Profusion, <HI>Virgil</HI> bestows
<PB REF="19"/>
with a careful Magnificence: <HI>Homer,</HI> like the <HI>Nile,</HI> pours out his Riches with a sudden Overflow; <HI>Virgil</HI> like a River in its Banks, with a gentle and constant Stream. When we behold their Battels, methinks the two Poets resemble the He∣roes they celebrate: <HI>Homer,</HI> boundless and irresi∣stible as <HI>Achilles,</HI> bears all before him, and shines more and more as the Tumult increases; <HI>Virgil,</HI> calmly daring like <HI>Aeneas,</HI> appears undisturb'd in the midst of the Action, disposes all about him, and conquers with Tranquillity: And when we look upon their Machines, <HI>Homer</HI> seems like his own <HI>Jupiter</HI> in his Terrors, shaking <HI>Olympus,</HI> scat∣tering the Lightnings, and firing the Heavens; <HI>Virgil,</HI> like the same Power in his Benevolence, counselling with the Gods, laying Plans for Em∣pires, and regularly ordering his whole Creation.</P>
<P>But after all, it is with great Parts as with great Virtues, they naturally border on some Im∣perfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the Virtue ends, or the Fault be∣gins. As Prudence may sometimes sink to Sus∣picion, so may a great Judgment decline to Coldness; and as Magnanimity may run up to Profusion or Extravagance, so may a great Inven∣tion to Redundancy or Wildness. If we look upon <HI>Homer</HI> in this View, we shall perceive the chief <HI>Objections</HI> against him to proceed from so noble a Cause as the Excess of this Faculty.</P>
<P>Among these we may reckon some of his <HI>Mar∣vellous Fictions,</HI> upon which so much Criticism
<PB REF="20"/>
has been spent as surpassing all the Bounds of Probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior Souls as with gigantick Bodies, which ex∣erting themselves with unusual Strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due Proportion of Parts, to become Miracles in the whole; and like the old Heroes of that Make, commit some∣thing near Extravagance amidst a Series of glo∣rious and inimitable Performances. Thus <HI>Homer</HI> has his <HI>speaking Horses,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> his <HI>Myrtles distilling Blood,</HI> without so much as contriving the easy Intervention of a Deity to save the Probability.</P>
<P>It is owing to the same vast Invention that his <HI>Similes</HI> have been thought too exuberant and full of Circumstances. The Force of this Faculty is seen in nothing more, than its In∣ability to confine itself to that single Circum∣stance upon which the Comparison is grounded: It runs out into Embellishments of additional Images, which however are so manag'd as not to overpower the main one. His Similes are like Pictures, where the principal Figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the Original, but is also set off with occasional Ornaments and Prospects. The same will account for his man∣ner of heaping a Number of Comparisons toge∣ther in one Breath, when his Fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent Images.

If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a Defect or Narrowness of Genius, than an Excess of it; those seeming Defects will be found upon Examination to proceed wholly from the Nature of the Times he liv'd in. Such are his <HI>grosser Representations</HI> of the <HI>Gods,</HI> and the vicious and <HI>imperfect Manners</HI> of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> which will be treated of in the following <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Articles of</HI> Theology <HI>and</HI> Morality, <HI>in the third Part of the</HI> Essay.</NOTE><HI>Essay:</HI> But I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a Point generally carry'd into Extreams both by the Censurers and Defenders of <HI>Homer.</HI> It must be a strange Partiality to Antiquity to think with Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"that <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Preface to her</HI> Homer.</NOTE> those Times and Man∣ners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours"</Q> Who can be so preju∣diced in their Favour as to magnify the Felicity of those Ages, when a Spirit of Revenge and Cruelty reign'd thro' the World, when no Mercy was shown but for the sake of Lucre, when the greatest Princes were put to the Sword, and their Wives and Daughters made Slaves and Concu∣bines? On the other side I would not be so deli∣cate as those modern Criticks, who are shock'd at the <HI>servile Offices</HI> and <HI>mean Employments</HI> in which we sometimes see the Heroes of <HI>Homer</HI> en∣gag'd. There is a Pleasure in taking a view of that Simplicity in Opposition to the Luxury of succeeding Ages; in beholding Monarchs without their Guards, Princes tending their Flocks, and
<PB REF="22"/>
Princesses drawing Water from the Springs. When we read <HI>Homer,</HI> we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient Author in the Heathen World; and those who consider him in this Light, will double their Pleasure in the Perusal of him. Let them think they are growing ac∣quainted with Nations and People that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand Years backward into the remotest An∣tiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprizing Vision of Things no where else to be found, and the only authentick Picture of that ancient World. By this means alone their greatest Obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their Dislike, will become a Sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>This Consideration may farther serve to an∣swer for the constant Use of the same <HI>Epithets</HI> to his Gods and Heroes, such as the <HI>far-darting Phoebus,</HI> the <HI>blue-ey'd Pallas,</HI> the <HI>swift-footed Achilles,</HI> &amp;c. which some have censured as im∣pertinent and tediously repeated. Those of the Gods depended upon the Powers and Offices then believ'd to belong to them, and had contracted a Weight and Veneration from the Rites and so∣lemn Devotions in which they were us'd: They were a sort of Attributes that it was a Matter of Religion to salute them with on all Occasions, and an Irreverence to omit. As for the Epithets of great Men, Mons. <HI>Boileau</HI> is of Opinion; that they were in the Nature of <HI>Surnames,</HI> and re∣peated
<PB REF="23"/>
as such; for the <HI>Greeks</HI> having no Names deriv'd from their Fathers, were oblig'd when they mention'd any one to add some other Di∣stinction; either naming his Parents expressly, or his Place of Birth, Profession, or the like: As <HI>Alexander</HI> Son of <HI>Philip, Herodotus</HI> of <HI>Halicar∣nassus, Diogenes</HI> the <HI>Cynic, &amp;c. Homer</HI> therefore complying with the Custom of his Countrey, us'd such distinctive Additions as better agreed with Poetry. And indeed we have something parallel to these in modern Times, such as the Names of <HI>Harold Harefoot, Edmund Iron∣side, Edward Long-shanks, Edward</HI> the <HI>black Prince, &amp;c.</HI> If yet this be thought to account better for the Propriety than for the Repetition, I shall add a farther Conjecture. <HI>Hesiod</HI> dividing the World into its Ages, has plac'd a fourth Age between the Brazen and the Iron one, of <HI>Heroes distinct from other Men, a divine Race, who fought at</HI> Thebes <HI>and</HI> Troy, <HI>are called Demi-Gods, and live by the Care of</HI> Jupiter <HI>in the Islands of the Blessed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hesiod, <HI>lib.</HI> 1. ℣. 155, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Now among the divine Honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the Gods, not to be mention'd without the Solemnity of an Epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their Families, Actions, or Qualities.</P>
<P>What other Cavils have been rais'd against <HI>Homer</HI> are such as hardly deserve a Reply, but
<PB REF="24"/>
will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the Course of the Work. Many have been occasion'd by an injudicious Endeavour to exalt <HI>Virgil;</HI> which is much the same, as if one should think to praise the Superstructure by undermining the Foundation: One would imagine by the whole Course of their Parallels, that these Criticks never so much as heard of <HI>Homer</HI>'s having written first; a Consideration which whoever compares these two Poets ought to have always in his Eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the Fable and Moral of the <HI>Aeneis</HI> to those of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> for the same Reasons which might set the <HI>Odysses</HI> above the <HI>Aeneis:</HI> as that the He∣roe is a wiser Man; and the Action of the one more beneficial to his Countrey than that of the other: Or else they blame him for not doing what he never design'd; as because <HI>Achilles</HI> is not as good and perfect a Prince as <HI>Aeneas,</HI> when the very Moral of his Poem requir'd a contrary Character. It is thus that <HI>Rapin</HI> judges in his Comparison of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> Others select those particular Passages of <HI>Homer</HI> which are not so labour'd as some that <HI>Virgil</HI> drew out of them: This is the whole Management of <HI>Scaliger</HI> in his <HI>Poetices.</HI> Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean Expressions, sometimes thro' a false Deli∣cacy and Refinement, oftner from an Ignorance of the Graces of the Original; and then tri∣umph in the Aukwardness of their own Trans∣lations.
<PB REF="25"/>
This is the Conduct of <HI>Perault</HI> in his <HI>Parallels.</HI> Lastly, there are others, who pretend∣ing to a fairer Proceeding, distinguish between the personal Merit of <HI>Homer,</HI> and that of his <HI>Work;</HI> but when they come to assign the Causes of the great Reputation of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> they found it upon the Ignorance of his Times, and the Prejudice of those that followed. And in pursuance of this Principle, they make those Accidents (such as the Contention of the Cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) to be the Causes of his Fame, which were in Reality the Consequences of his Merit. The same might as well be said of <HI>Virgil,</HI> or any great Author, whose general Character will infallibly raise many casual Ad∣ditions to their Reputation. This is the Method of Mons. <HI>de la Motte;</HI> who yet confesses upon the whole, that in whatever Age <HI>Homer</HI> had liv'd he must have been the greatest Poet of his Na∣tion, and that he may be said in this Sense to be the Master even of those who surpass'd him.</P>
<P>In all these Objections we see nothing that contradicts his Title to the Honour of the chief <HI>Invention;</HI> and as long as this (which is indeed the Characteristic of Poetry itself) remains une∣qual'd by his Followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler Judgment may commit fewer Faults, and be more approv'd in the Eves of <HI>One Sort</HI> of Criticks: but that Warmth of Fancy will carry the loudest and most universal Applauses which holds the Heart of a Reader under the strongest Enchantment. <HI>Homer</HI> not only appears
<PB REF="26"/>
the Inventor of Poetry, but excells all the Inven∣tors of other Arts in this, that he has swallow'd up the Honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no Encrease, it on∣ly lest room for Contraction or Regulation. He shew'd all the Stretch of Fancy at once; and if he has fail'd in some of his Flights, it was but be∣cause he attempted every thing. A Work of this kind seems like a mighty Tree which rises from the most vigorous Seed, is improv'd with Industry, flourishes, and produces the finest Fruit; Nature and Art have conspir'd to raise it; Pleasure and Profit join'd to make it valuable: and they who find the justest Faults, have only said, that a few Branches (which run luxuriant thro' a Richness of Nature) might be lopp'd into Form to give it a more regular Appearance.</P>
<P>Having now spoken of the Beauties and De∣fects of the Original, it remains to treat of the Translation, with the same View to the chief Characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main Parts of the Poem, such as the <HI>Fable, Manners,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments,</HI> no Translator can prejudice it but by wilful Omissions or Contractions. As it also breaks out in every particular <HI>Image, Description,</HI> and <HI>Simile;</HI> whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief Character. It is the first grand Duty of an Interpreter to give his Author entire and unmaim'd; and for the rest, the <HI>Diction</HI> and <HI>Versification</HI> only are his
<PB REF="27"/>
proper Province; since these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</P>
<P>It should then be consider'd what Methods may afford some Equivalent in our Language for the Graces of these in the <HI>Greek.</HI> It is certain no literal Translation can be just to an excellent Original in a superior Language: but it is a great Mi∣stake to imagine (as many have done) that a rash Paraphrase can make amends for this ge∣neral Defect; which is no less in danger to lose the Spirit of an Ancient, by deviating into the modern Manners of Expression. If there be some∣times a <HI>Darkness,</HI> there is often a <HI>Light</HI> in Anti∣quity, which nothing better preserves than a Ver∣sion almost literal. I know no Liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary for trans∣fusing the Spirit of the Original, and supporting the Poetical Style of the Translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been more Men misled in former times by a servile dull Adhe∣rence to the Letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent Hope of raising and improving their Author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Poem is what a Translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: However it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the Whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is, in any particular Place. 'Tis a great Secret in Writing to know when to be plain, and when poetical
<PB REF="28"/>
and figurative; and it is what <HI>Homer</HI> will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his Foot∣steps. Where his Diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of incurring the Censure of a meer <HI>English</HI> Critick. Nothing that belongs to <HI>Homer</HI> seems to have been more com∣monly mistaken than the just Pitch of his Style: Some of his Translators having swell'd into Fus∣tian in a proud Confidence of the <HI>Sublime;</HI> others sunk into Flatness in a cold and timorous Notion of <HI>Simplicity.</HI> Methinks I see these different Fol∣lowers of <HI>Homer,</HI> some sweating and straining after him by violent Leaps and Bounds, (the cer∣tain Signs of false Mettle) others slowly and ser∣vilely creeping in his Train, while the Poet him∣self is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal Majesty before them. However of the two Extreams one could sooner pardon Frenzy than Frigidity: No Author is to be envy'd for such Commendations as he may gain by that Cha∣racter of Style, which his Friends must agree together to call <HI>Simplicity,</HI> and the rest of the World will call <HI>Dulness.</HI> There is a <HI>graceful</HI> and <HI>dignify'd</HI> Simplicity, as well as a <HI>bald</HI> and <HI>sordid</HI> one, which differ as much from each other as the Air of a <HI>plain</HI> Man from that of a <HI>Sloven:</HI> 'Tis one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dress'd at all. Simplicity is the Mean between Ostentation and Rusticity.</P>
<P><PB REF="29"/>
This pure and noble Simplicity is no where in such Perfection as in the <HI>Scripture</HI> and our Author. One may affirm with all respect to the inspired Writings, that the <HI>Divine Spirit</HI> made use of no other Words but what were intelligi∣ble and common to Men at that Time, and in that Part of the World; and as <HI>Homer</HI> is the Au∣thor nearest to those, his Style must of course bear a greater Resemblance to the sacred Books than that of any other Writer. This Considera∣tion (together with what has been observ'd of the Parity of some of his Thoughts) may methinks induce a Translator on the one hand to give into several of those general Phrases and Man∣ners of Expression, which have attain'd a Vene∣ration even in our Language from their use in the <HI>Old Testament;</HI> as on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divi∣nity, and in a manner consign'd to Mystery and Religion.</P>
<P>For a farther Preservation of this Air of Sim∣plicity, a particular Care should be taken to ex∣press with all Plainness those <HI>Moral Sentences</HI> and <HI>Proverbial Speeches</HI> which are so numerous in this Poet. They have something Venerable, and as I may say <HI>Oracular,</HI> in that unadorn'd Gravity and Shortness with which they are deliver'd: a Grace which would be utterly lost by endea∣vouring to give them what we call a more in∣genious (that is a more modern) Turn in the Paraphrase.</P>

Perhaps the Mixture of some <HI>Graecisms</HI> and old Words after the manner of <HI>Milton,</HI> if done with∣out too much Affectation, might not have an ill Effect in a Version of this particular Work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable <HI>Antique</HI> Cast. But certainly the use of <HI>modern Terms</HI> of <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> such as <HI>Platoon, Campagne, Junto,</HI> or the like (which some of his Translators have fallen into) cannot be allow∣able; those only excepted, without which it is impossible to treat the Subjects in any living Language.</P>
<P>There are two Peculiarities in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Diction that are a sort of <HI>Marks</HI> or <HI>Moles,</HI> by which every common Eye distinguishes him at first sight: Those who are not his greatest Admirers look upon them as Defects, and those who are seem pleased with them as Beauties. I speak of his <HI>Compound-Epithets</HI> and of his <HI>Repetitions.</HI> Many of the former cannot be done literally into <HI>English</HI> without destroying the Purity of our Language. I believe such should be retain'd as slide easily of themselves into an <HI>English-Compound,</HI> without Violence to the Ear or to the receiv'd Rules of Composition; as well as those which have re∣ceiv'd a Sanction from the Authority of our best Poets, and are become familiar thro' their use of them; such as the <HI>Cloud-compelling Jove, &amp;c.</HI> As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly exprest in a single word as in a com∣pounded one, the Course to be taken is obvious.
<PB REF="33"/>
Some that cannot be so turn'd as to preserve their full Image by one or two Words, may have Ju∣stice done them by Circumlocution; as the Epi∣thet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to a Mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally <HI>Leaf-shaking,</HI> but affords a majestic Idea in the <HI>Periphrasis: The lofty Mountains shakes his waving Woods.</HI> Others that admit of differing Significations, may re∣ceive an Advantage by a judicious Variation ac∣cording to the Occasions on which they are in∣troduc'd. For Example, the Epithet of <HI>Apollo,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>far-shooting,</HI> is capable of two Explica∣tions; one literal in respect of the Darts and Bow, the Ensigns of that God; the other allego∣rical with regard to the Rays of the Sun: There∣fore in such Places where <HI>Apollo</HI> is represented as a God in Person, I would use the former Inter∣pretation, and where the Effects of the Sun are describ'd, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual Repetition of the same Epithets which we find in <HI>Homer,</HI> and which, tho' it might be accommodated (as has been already shewn) to the Ear of those Times, is by no means so to ours: But one may wait for Opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional Beauty from the Occasions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a Translator may at once shew his Fancy and his Judgment.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Repetitions;</HI> we may divide them into three sorts; of whole Narrations and
<PB REF="34"/>
Speeches, of single Sentences, and of one Verse or Hemistich. I hope it is not impossible to have such a Regard to these, as neither to lose so known a Mark of the Author on the one hand, nor to offend the Reader too much on the other. The Repetition is not ungraceful in those Speeches where the Dignity of the Speaker renders it a sort of Insolence to alter his Words; as in the Messa∣ges from Gods to Men, or from higher Powers to Inferiors in Concerns of State, or where the Ceremonial of Religion seems to require it, in the solemn Forms of Prayers, Oaths, or the like. In other Cases, I believe the best Rule is to be guided by the Nearness, or Distance, at which the Repe∣titions are plac'd in the Original: When they follow too close one may vary the Expression, but it is a Question whether a profess'd Transla∣tor be authorized to omit any: If they be tedi∣ous, the Author is to answer for it.</P>
<P>It only remains to speak of the <HI>Versification. Homer</HI> (as has been said) is perpetually applying the Sound to the Sense, and varying it on every new Subject. This is indeed one of the most ex∣quisite Beauties of Poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of <HI>Homer</HI> eminent for it in the <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> in <HI>Latine.</HI> I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by Chance, when a Writer is warm, and fully possest of his Image: however it may be reasonably believed they de∣sign'd this, in whose Verse it so manifestly ap∣pears in a superior degree to all others. Few
<PB REF="35"/>
Readers have the Ear to be Judges of it, but those who have will see I have endeavour'd at this Beauty.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I must confess my self ut∣terly incapable of doing Justice to <HI>Homer.</HI> I at∣tempt him in no other Hope but that which one may entertain without much Vanity, of giving a more tolerable Copy of him than any entire Trans∣lation in Verse has yet done. We have only those of <HI>Chapman, Hobbes,</HI> and <HI>Ogilby. Chapman</HI> has ta∣ken the Advantage of an immeasurable Length of Verse, notwithstanding which there is scarce any Paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent Interpolations of four or six Lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth Book of the <HI>Odysses, ver.</HI> 312. where he has spun twenty Verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other Places of his Notes insist so much upon Verbal Trifles. He appears to have had a strong Affectation of extracting new Meanings out of his Author, insomuch as to promise in his Rhyming Preface, a Poem of the Mysteries he had revealed in <HI>Homer;</HI> and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious Sense to this End. His Expression is involved in Fustian, a Fault for which he was remarkable in his Original Writings, as in the Tragedy of <HI>Bussyd' Amboise,</HI> &amp;c. In a word, the Nature of the Man may account for his whole Performance; for he appears from his Preface and Remarks to have been of an ar∣rogant
<PB REF="36"/>
Turn, and an Enthusiast in Poetry. His own Boast of having finish'd half the <HI>Iliad</HI> in less than fifteen Weeks, shews with what Negli∣gence his Version was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contri∣buted to cover his Defects, is a daring fiery Spirit that animates his Translation, which is something like what one might imagine <HI>Homer</HI> himself would have writ before he arriv'd to Years of Discretion. <HI>Hobbes</HI> has given us a correct Explanation of the Sense in general, but for Particulars and Circum∣stances he continually lopps them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteem'd a close Translation, I doubt not many have been led into that Error by the Shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the Original Line by Line, but from the Contractions above-men∣tioned. He sometimes omits whole Similes and Sentences, and is now and then guilty of Mi∣stakes which no Writer of his Learning could have fallen into, but thro' Carelesness. His Poe∣try, as well as <HI>Ogilby</HI>'s, is too mean for Criticism.</P>
<P>It is a great Loss to the Poetical World that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> did not live to translate the <HI>Iliad.</HI> He has left us only the first Book and a small Part of the sixth; in which if he has in some Places not truly interpreted the Sense, or preserved the Antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of the Haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much Regard to <HI>Chapman,</HI> whose Words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily
<PB REF="37"/>
follow'd him in Passages where he wanders from the Original. However had he translated the whole Work, I would no more have attempted <HI>Homer</HI> after him than <HI>Virgil,</HI> his Version of whom (notwithstanding some human Errors) is the most noble and spirited Translation I know in any Lan∣guage. But the Fate of great Genius's is like that of great Ministers, tho' they are confessedly the first in the Commonwealth of Letters, they must be envy'd and calumniated only for being at the Head of it.</P>
<P>That which in my Opinion ought to be the Endeavour of any one who translates <HI>Homer,</HI> is above all things to keep alive that Spirit and Fire which makes his chief Character. In particular Places, where the Sense can bear any Doubt, to follow the strongest and most Poetical, as most agreeing with that Character. To copy him in all the Variations of his Style, and the different Modulations of his Numbers. To preserve in the more active or descriptive Parts, a Warmth and Elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a Plainness and Solemnity; in the Speeches a Ful∣ness and Perspicuity; in the Sentences a Shortness and Gravity. Not to neglect even the little Figures and Turns on the Words, nor some∣times the very Cast of the Periods. Neither to omit or confound any Rites or Customs of Antiquity. Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter Compass, than has hitherto been done by any Translator who has tolerably
<PB REF="38"/>
preserved either the Sense or Poetry. What I would farther recommend to him, is to study his Author rather from his own Text than from any Commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever Figure they make in the Estimation of the World. To consider him attentively in Comparison with <HI>Virgil</HI> above all the Ancients, and with <HI>Milton</HI> above all the Moderns. Next these the Archbishop of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s <HI>Telemachus</HI> may give him the truest Idea of the Spirit and Turn of our Author, and <HI>Bossu</HI>'s admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest Notion of his Design and Conduct. But after all, with whatever Judgment and Study a Man may proceed, or with whatever Happiness he may perform such a Work; he must hope to please but a few, those only who have at once a Taste of Poetry, and competent Learning. For to satisfy such as want either, is not in the Nature of this Undertaking; since a meer Modern Wit can like nothing that is not <HI>Modern,</HI> and a Pedant nothing that is not <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>What I have done is submitted to the Publick, from whose Opinions I am prepared to learn; tho' I fear no Judges so little as our best Poets, who are most sensible of the Weight of this Task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some Concern as they are unhappy Men, but none as they are malignant Writers. I was guided in this Translation by Judgments very different from theirs, and by Per∣sons for whom they can have no Kindness, if an
<PB REF="39"/>
old Observation be true, that the strongest Anti∣pathy in the World is that of Fools to Men of Wit. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> was the first whose Advice deter∣min'd me to undertake this Task, who was pleas'd to write to me upon that Occasion in such Terms as I cannot repeat without Vanity. I was obliged to Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> for a very early Recommen∣dation of my Undertaking to the Publick. Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> promoted my Interest with that Warmth with which he always serves his Friend. The Humanity and Frankness of Sir <HI>Samuel Garth</HI> are what I never knew wanting on any Occasion. I must also acknowledge with infinite Pleasure the many friendly Offices as well as sincere Cri∣ticisms of Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> who had led me the way in translating some Parts of <HI>Homer,</HI> as I wish for the sake of the World he had prevented me in the rest. I must add the Names of Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> and Dr. <HI>Parnell,</HI> tho' I shall take a farther Opportunity of doing Justice to the last, whose Good-nature (to give it a great Panegyrick) is no less extensive than his Learning. The Favour of these Gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an Affection. But what can I say of the Honour so many of the <HI>Great</HI> have done me, while the <HI>First Names</HI> of the Age appear as my Subscribers, and the most distinguish'd Patrons and Ornaments of Learning as my chief Encouragers. Among these it is a particular Pleasure to me to find, that my highest Obligations are to such who have done most Ho∣nour
<PB REF="40"/>
to the Name of Poet: That his Grace the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was not displeas'd I should undertake the Author to whom he has given (in his excellent <HI>Essay</HI>) the finest Praise he ever yet receiv'd.<Q><L>Read <HI>Homer once,</HI> and you can read no more;</L>
<L>For all things else appear so mean and poor,</L>
<L>Verse will seem Prose: yet <HI>often</HI> on him look,</L>
<L>And you will hardly need another Book.</L></Q> That the Earl of <HI>Halifax</HI> was one of the first to favour me, of whom it is hard to say whether the Advancement of the Polite Arts is more owing to his Generosity or his Example. That such a Genius as my Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> not more di∣stinguished in the great Scenes of Business than in all the useful and entertaining Parts of Learn∣ing, has not refus'd to be the Critick of these Sheets, and the Patron of their Writer. And that so excellent an Imitator of <HI>Homer</HI> as the no∣ble Author of the Tragedy of <HI>Heroic Love,</HI> has continu'd his Partiality to me from my writing Pastorals to my attempting the <HI>Iliad.</HI> I cannot deny my self the Pride of confessing, that I have had the Advantage not only of their Advice for the Conduct in general, but their Correction of several Particulars of this Translation.</P>
<P>I could say a great deal of the Pleasure of be∣ing distinguish'd by the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> but it is almost absurd to particularize any one gene∣rous
<PB REF="41"/>
Action in a Person whose whole Life is a continued Series of them. The Right Honoura∣ble Mr. <HI>Stanhope,</HI> the present Secretary of State, will pardon my Desire of having it known that he was pleas'd to promote this Affair. The par∣ticular Zeal of Mr. <HI>Harcourt</HI> (the Son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a Proof how much I am honour'd in a Share of his Friendship. I must attribute to the same Motive that of several others of my Friends, to whom all Acknowledgments are render'd unnecessary by the Privileges of a fa∣miliar Correspondence: And I am satisfy'd I can no way better oblige Men of their Turn, than by my Silence.</P>
<P>In short, I have found more Patrons than ever <HI>Homer</HI> wanted. He would have thought himself happy to have met the same Favour at <HI>Athens,</HI> that has been shewn me by its learned Rival, the University of <HI>Oxford.</HI> If my Author had the <HI>Wits</HI> of After-Ages for his Defenders, his Trans∣lator has had the <HI>Beauties</HI> of the present for his Advocates; a Pleasure too great to be changed for any Fame in Reversion. And I can hardly envy him those pompous Honours he receiv'd af∣ter Death, when I reflect on the Enjoyment of so many agreeable Obligations, and easy Friendships which make the Satisfaction of Life. This Di∣stinction is the more to be acknowledg'd, as it is shewn to one whose Pen has never gratify'd the Prejudices of particular <HI>Parties,</HI> or the Vanities of particular <HI>Men.</HI> Whatever the Success may
<PB REF="42"/>
prove, I shall never repent of an Undertaking in which I have experienc'd the Candour and Friendship of so many Persons of Merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those Years of Youth that are generally lost in a Circle of Fol∣lies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to my self.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE, WRITINGS and LEARNING, OF HOMER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THERE is something in the Mind of Man, which goes beyond bare Curiosity, and even carries us on to a Shadow of Friendship with those great Genius's whom we have known to excel in former Ages. Nor will it appear less to any one, who considers how much it par∣takes of the Nature of Friendship; how it compounds itself of an Admiration rais'd by what we meet with concerning them; a Tendency to be farther acquainted with them, by gathering every Circumstance of their Lives; a kind of Complacency in their Company, when we retire to enjoy what they have left; an Union with them in those Sentiments they approve; and an En∣deavour to defend them, when we think they are injuriously at∣tack'd, or even sometimes with too partial an Affection.</P>
<P>There is also in Mankind a Spirit of Envy or Opposition, which makes them uneasy to see others of the same Species
<PB N="2" REF="47"/>
seated far above them in a sort of Perfection. And this, at least so far as we speak of the Fame of Writers, has not always been known to dye with a Man entirely, but to pursue his Re∣mains with idle Traditions, and weak Conjectures; so that his Name, which is not to be forgotten, shall be preserv'd only to be stain'd and blotted. The Controversy, which was carry'd on between the Author and his Enemies, while he yet was living, shall still be kept on foot; not entirely upon his own account, but on theirs who live after him; some being fond to praise extravagantly, and others as rashly eager to contradict his Ad∣mirers. This Proceeding, on both sides, gives us an Image of the first Descriptions of War, such as the <HI>Iliad</HI> affords; where a Heroe disputes the Field with an Army 'til it is his time to dye, and then the Battel, which we expected to fall of course, is renew'd about the Body; his Friends contending that they may embalm and honour it, his Enemies that they may cast it to the Dogs and Vultures.</P>
<P>There are yet others of a low kind of Taste, who, without any Malignity to the Character of a great Author, lessen the Dignity of their Subject by insisting too meanly upon little Particularities. They imagine it the Part of an Historian to omit nothing they meet concerning him whom they write upon; and gather every thing wherein he is nam'd, without any distinction, to the Prejudice or Neglect of the more noble Parts of his Character: Like those trifling Painters, or Sculptors, who be∣stow infinite Pains and Patience upon the most insignificant Parts of a Figure, 'till they sink the Grandeur of the Whole, by finishing every thing with the neatest Want of Judgment.</P>
<P>Besides these, there is a fourth sort of Men, who pretend to divest themselves of impetuous Emotions on both sides, and to get above that imperfect Idea of their Subject, which little Writers fall into; who propose to themselves a calm Search after Truth, and a rational Adherence to Probability in their historical Collections: Who neither wish to be led into the Fa∣bles of Poetry, nor are willing to support the Falsehoods of a malignant Criticism; but, endeavouring to steer in a middle way, have obtain'd a Character of failing least in the Choice of Ma∣terials for History, even from the darkest Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="48"/>
Being therefore to write something concerning a Life, which there is little Prospect of our knowing, after it has been the fruitless Enquiry of so many Ages, and which has however been thus differently treated by Historians, I shall endeavour to speak of it, not as a Certainty, but as the Tradition, Opinion, or Collection of Authors, who have been suppos'd to write of <HI>Homer</HI> in these four preceding Methods, to which we shall also add some farther Conjectures of our own. After his Life has been thus rather spoken of than discover'd, I shall consider him historically as an Author, with regard to those Works which he has left behind him: In doing which, we may trace the degrees of Esteem they have obtain'd in different Periods of Time, and regulate our present Opinion of them, by a View of that Age in which they were written.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">I. <HI>Stories of</HI> Ho∣mer, <HI>which are the Ef∣fects of</HI> ex∣travagant Admiration.</NOTE> I. If we take a View of <HI>Homer</HI> in those fabulous Traditions which the Admiration of the ancient Heathens has occasion'd, we find them running to Superstition, and multiply'd and inde∣pendent on one another, in the different Accounts which are gi∣ven with respect to <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> the two native Coun∣treys of Fable.</P>
<P>We have one in <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Eustathius <HI>in Od.</HI> 12.</NOTE><HI>Eustathius</HI> most strangely fram'd, which <HI>Alexander Paphius</HI> has reported concerning <HI>Homer</HI>'s Birth and Infancy. That <Q REND="inline">"He was born in <HI>Aegypt</HI> of <HI>Dmasagoras</HI> and <HI>Aethra,</HI> and brought up by a Daughter of <HI>Orus,</HI> the Priest of <HI>Isis,</HI> who was herself a Prophetess, and from whose Breasts Drops of Honey would frequently distil into the Mouth of the Infant. In the Night-time the first Sounds he utter'd were the Notes of nine several Birds: In the Morning he was found playing with nine Doves in the Bed: The <HI>Sybil,</HI> who attended him, us'd to be seiz'd with a poetical Fury, and utter Verses, in which she commanded <HI>Dmasagoras</HI> to build a Tem∣ple to the Muses: This he perform'd in Obedience to her Inspiration, and related all these things to the Child when he was grown up; who, in Memory of the Doves which play'd with him during his Infancy, has in his Works prefer'd this Bird to the Honour of bringing <HI>Ambrosia</HI> to <HI>Jupiter.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="49"/>
One would think a Story of this Nature, so fit for Age to talk of, and Infancy to hear, were incapable of being handed down to us. But we find the Tradition again taken up to be heighten'd in one part, and carry'd forward in another. <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heliod. Aethiop. <HI>l.</HI> 3.</NOTE><HI>Heliodorus,</HI> who had heard of this Claim which <HI>Aegypt</HI> put in for <HI>Homer,</HI> en∣deavours to strengthen it by naming <HI>Thebes</HI> for the particular place of his Birth. He allows too, that a Priest was his repu∣ted Father, but that his real Father, according to the Opinion of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> was <HI>Mercury:</HI> He says, <Q REND="inline">"That when the Priest was celebrating the Rites of his Countrey, and therefore slept with his Wife in the Temple, the God had knowledge of her, and begot <HI>Homer:</HI> That he was born with Tufts of Hair on his <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Femur.</NOTE>Thigh, as a Sign of unlawful Generation, from whence he was called <HI>Homer</HI> by the Nations through which he wander'd: That he himself was the occasion why this Story of his di∣vine Extraction is unknown; because he neither told his Name, Race, nor Countrey, being asham'd of his Exile, to which his reputed Father drove him from among the con∣secrated Youths, on account of that Mark which their Priests esteem'd a Testimony of an incestuous Birth."</Q></P>
<P>These are the extravagant Stories by which Men, who have not been able to express how much they admire him, transcend the Bounds of Probability to say something extraordinary. The Mind, that becomes dazled with the Sight of his Performances, loses the common Idea of a Man in the fansy'd Splendor of Per∣fection: It sees nothing less than a God worthy to be his Fa∣ther, nothing less than a Prophetess deserving to be his Nurse, and, growing unwilling that he should be spoken of in a Lan∣guage beneath its Imaginations, delivers Fables in the place of History.</P>
<P>But whatever has thus been offer'd to support the Claim of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> they who plead for <HI>Greece</HI> are not to be accus'd for coming short of it. Their Fansie rose with a Refinement above what we are suppos'd to have of their Masters, and frequently the Veil of Fiction is wrought fine enough to be seen through, so that it hardly hides the Meaning it is made to cover, from the first Glance of the Imagination. For a Proof of this, we may
<PB N="5" REF="50"/>
mention that Poetical Genealogy which is deliver'd for <HI>Homer</HI>'s, in the <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE><HI>Greek</HI> Treatise of the Contention between him and <HI>Hesiod,</HI> and but little vary'd by the Relation of it in <HI>Suidas.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Poet <HI>Linus</HI> (say they) was born of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Thoose,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Neptune. Pierus</HI> of <HI>Linus: Oeagrus</HI> of King <HI>Pierus</HI> and the Nymph <HI>Methone: Orpheus</HI> of <HI>Oeagrus</HI> and the Muse <HI>Calliope.</HI> From <HI>Orpheus</HI> came <HI>Othrys:</HI> from him <HI>Har∣monides:</HI> from him <HI>Philoterpus:</HI> from him <HI>Euphemus:</HI> from him <HI>Epiphrades,</HI> who begot <HI>Menalops,</HI> the Father of <HI>Dius: Dius</HI> had <HI>Hesiod</HI> the Poet and <HI>Perses</HI> by <HI>Pucamede,</HI> the Daugh∣ter of <HI>Apollo.</HI> Then <HI>Perses</HI> had <HI>Maeon,</HI> on whose Daughter <HI>Crytheis,</HI> the River <HI>Meles</HI> begot <HI>Homer.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Here we behold a wonderful Genealogy contriv'd industriously to raise our Idea to the highest, where Gods, Goddesses, Muses, Kings, and Poets link in a descent; nay, where Poets are made to depend, as it were, in Clusters upon the same Stalk beneath one another. If we consider too that <HI>Har∣monides</HI> is deriv'd from Harmony, <HI>Philoterpus</HI> from love of De∣light, <HI>Euphemus</HI> from beautiful Diction, <HI>Epiphrades</HI> from In∣telligence, and <HI>Pucamede</HI> from Prudence; it may not be im∣probable, but the Inventors meant, by a Fiction of this Nature, to turn such Qualifications into Persons as were agreeable to his Character, for whom the Line was drawn: So that every thing, Divine or Great, will thus come together by the extra∣vagant Indulgence of Fancy, while it turns itself sometimes to Admiration, and sometimes to Allegory.</P>
<P>After this fabulous Tree of his Pedigree, we may regularly view him in one Passage concerning his Birth, which, though it differs in a Circumstance from what has been here deliver'd, yet carries on the same Air, and regards the same Traditions. There is a short Life of <HI>Homer</HI> attributed to <HI>Plutarch,</HI> wherein a third part of <HI>Aristotle</HI> on Poetry, which is now lost, is quoted for an account of his uncommon Birth, in this manner. <Q REND="inline">"At the time when <HI>Neleus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Codrus,</HI> led the Colony which was sent into <HI>Ionia,</HI> there was in the Island of <HI>Io</HI> a young Girl, compress'd by a <HI>Genius,</HI> who delighted to asso∣ciate with the <HI>Muses,</HI> and share in their Consorts. She, finding
<PB N="6" REF="51"/>
herself with Child, and being touch'd with the Shame of what had happen'd to her, remov'd from thence to a Place call'd <HI>Aegina.</HI> There she was taken in an Excursion made by Robbers, and being brought to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> which was then un∣der the <HI>Lydians,</HI> they gave her to <HI>Maeon</HI> the King, who mar∣ry'd her upon account of her Beauty. But while she walk'd on the Bank of the River <HI>Meles,</HI> she brought forth <HI>Homer</HI> and expir'd. The Infant was taken by <HI>Maeon,</HI> and bred up as his Son, 'till the Death of that Prince."</Q> And from this Point of the Story the Poet is let down into his traditional Poverty. Here we see, tho' he be taken out of the Lineage of <HI>Meles</HI> where we met him before, he has still as wonderful a Rise in∣vented for him; he is still to spring from a <HI>Demigod,</HI> one who was of a Poetical Disposition, from whom he might inherit a Soul turn'd to Poetry, and receive an Assistance of heavenly Inspiration.</P>
<P>In his Life the most general Tradition concerning him is his <HI>Blindness,</HI> yet there are some who will not allow even this to have happen'd after the manner in which it falls upon other Men: Chance and Sickness are excluded; nothing less than Gods and Heroes must be visibly concern'd about him. Thus we find among the different Accounts which <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hermias <HI>in Phaed. Plat.</HI> Leo Allat. <HI>de Patr. Hom. C.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE><HI>Hermias</HI> has collected concerning his Blindness, that when <HI>Homer</HI> resolv'd to write of <HI>Achilles,</HI> he had an exceeding Desire to fill his Mind with a just Idea of so glorious a Heroe: Wherefore, having paid all due Honours at his Tomb, he intreats that he may obtain a sight of him. The Heroe grants his Poet's Petition, and rises in a glorious Suit of Armour, which cast so unsufferable a Splen∣dor, that <HI>Homer</HI> lost his Eyes, while he gaz'd for the Enlarge∣ment of his Notions.</P>
<P>If this be any thing more than a meer Fable, one would be apt to imagine it insinuated his contracting a Blindness by too intense an Application while he wrote his <HI>Iliad.</HI> But it is a very pompous way of letting us into the Knowledge of so short a Truth: It looks as if Men imagin'd the Lives of Poets should be Poetically written; that to speak plainly of them, were to speak contemptibly; or that we debase them, when they are
<PB N="7" REF="52"/>
plac'd in less glorious Company than those exalted Spirits which they themselves have been fond to celebrate. We may however in some measure be reconcil'd to this last idle Fable, for having occasion'd so beautiful an <HI>Episode</HI> in the <HI>Ambra</HI> of <HI>Politian.</HI> That which does not inform us in a History, may please us in its proper Sphere of Poetry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">II. <HI>Stories of</HI> Ho∣mer <HI>proceed∣ing from</HI> En∣vy.</NOTE> II. Such Stories as these have been the Effects of a supersti∣tious Fondness, and of our Astonishment at what we consider in a View of Perfection. But neither have all Men the same Taste, nor do they equally submit to the Superiority of others, nor bear that human Nature, which they know to be imperfect, should be prais'd in an Extream without opposition. From some Principles of this kind have arisen a second sort of Stories, which glance at <HI>Homer</HI> with malignant Suppositions, and endeavour to throw a diminishing Air over his Life, as a kind of Answer to those who sought to aggrandize him injudiciously.</P>
<P>Under this Head we may reckon those ungrounded Conjectures with which his Adversaries asperse the very Design and Prosecution of his Travels, when they insinuate, that they were one continued Search after Authors who had written before him, and particularly upon the same Subject, in order to destroy them, or to rob them of their Inventions.</P>
<P>Thus we read in <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sic. <HI>l.</HI> 4.</NOTE><HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That there was one <HI>Daphne,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Tiresias,</HI> who from her Inspirations obtain'd the Title of a <HI>Sybil.</HI> She had a very extraordinary Genius, and being made Priestess at <HI>Delphos,</HI> wrote Oracles with wonderful Elegance, which <HI>Homer</HI> sought for, and adorn'd his Poems with several of her Verses."</Q> But she is plac'd so far in the fabulous Age of the World, that nothing can be averr'd of her: And as for the Verses now ascrib'd to the <HI>Sybils,</HI> they are more modern than to be able to confirm the Story; which, as it is universally assented to, discovers that whatever there is in them in common with <HI>Homer,</HI> the Compilers have rather taken from him; perhaps to strengthen the Authority of their Work by the Protection of this Tradition.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="53"/>
The next Insinuation we hear is from <HI>Suidas,</HI> that <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who fought at <HI>Troy,</HI> was famous for Poetry, and wrote concern∣ing that War in the <HI>Dorick</HI> Letter which he invented, proba∣bly much against <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Ulysses,</HI> his mortal Enemies. Upon this Account some have fancy'd his Works were suppress'd by <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Posterity, or that their entire Destruction was contriv'd and effected by <HI>Homer</HI> when he undertook the same Subject. But surely the Works of so considerable a Man, when they had been able to bear up so long a time as that which pass'd between the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the flourishing of <HI>Homer,</HI> must have been too much dispers'd, for one of so mean a Con∣dition as he is represented, to have destroy'd in every place, tho' he had been never so much assisted by the vigilant Temper of Envy. And we may say too, that what might have been capable of raising this Principle in him, must be capable of be∣ing in some measure esteem'd, and of having at least one Line of it preserv'd to us.</P>
<P>After him, in the order of time, we meet with a whole Set of Names, to whom the Maligners of <HI>Homer</HI> would have him oblig'd, without being able to prove their Assertion. <HI>Suidas</HI> mentions <HI>Corinnus Iliensis,</HI> the Secretary of <HI>Palamedes,</HI> who writ a Poem upon the same Subject, but no one is produc'd as having seen it. <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tzetzes <HI>Chil.</HI> 5. <HI>Hist.</HI> 29.</NOTE><HI>Tzetzes</HI> mentions (and from <HI>Johannes Melala</HI> only) <HI>Sisyphus</HI> the <HI>Coan,</HI> Secretary of <HI>Teucer,</HI> but it is not so much as known if he writ Verse or Prose. Besides these, are <HI>Dictys</HI> the <HI>Cretan,</HI> Secretary to <HI>Idomeneus,</HI> and <HI>Dares</HI> the <HI>Phry∣gian</HI> an Attendant of <HI>Hector,</HI> who have spurious Treatises passing under their Names. From each of these is <HI>Homer</HI> said to have borrow'd his whole Argument; so inconsistent are these Stories with one another.</P>
<P>The next Names we find, are <HI>Demodocus,</HI> whom <HI>Homer</HI> might have met at <HI>Corcyra,</HI> and <HI>Phemius,</HI> whom he might have met at <HI>Ithaca:</HI> the one (as <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Plutarch <HI>on Musick.</HI></NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> says) having according to Tradition written the War at <HI>Troy,</HI> the other the <HI>Return</HI> of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Captains. But these are only two Names of Friends, which he is pleas'd to honour with Eternity in his Poem, or two different Pictures of himself, as Author of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="54"/>
<HI>Odysses,</HI> or entirely the Children of his Imagination, without any particular Allusion. So that his Usage here, puts me in mind of his own <HI>Vulcan</HI> in the <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Iliad 18.</NOTE><HI>Iliad:</HI> The God had cast two Statues which he endued with the Power of Motion; and it is said presently after, that he is scarce able to go unless they support him.</P>
<P>It is reported by some, says <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ptol. Eph. <HI>Excerpt. apud Photium. l.</HI> 5.</NOTE><HI>Ptolomaeus Ephestio,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That there was before <HI>Homer,</HI> a Woman of <HI>Memphis,</HI> call'd <HI>Phantasia,</HI> who writ of the Wars of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the Wandrings of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> Now <HI>Homer</HI> arriving at <HI>Memphis</HI> where she had laid up her Works, and getting acquainted with <HI>Phanitas,</HI> whose Business it was to copy the sacred Writings, he obtain'd a sight of these, and follow'd entirely the Scheme she had drawn."</Q> But this is a wild Story, which speaks of an <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Woman with a <HI>Greek</HI> Name, and who never was heard of but upon this account. It appears indeed from his Knowledge of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Learning, that he was initiated into their Mysteries, and for ought we know by one <HI>Phanitas.</HI> But if we consider what the Name of the Wo∣man signifies, it seems only as if from being us'd in a figurative Expression, it had been mistaken afterwards for a proper Name. And then the Meaning will be, that having gather'd as much Information concerning the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Trojan</HI> Story, as he could be furnish'd with from the Accounts of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which were generally mix'd with Fancy and Fable, he wrought out his Plans of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and the <HI>Odysses.</HI></P>
<P>We pass all these Stories, together with the <HI>little Iliad</HI> of <HI>Sia∣grus,</HI> mention'd by <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Aelian, <HI>l.</HI> 14. <HI>c.</HI> 21.</NOTE><HI>Aelian.</HI> But one cannot leave this Subject without reflecting on the depreciating Humour, and odd Indu∣stry of Man, which shews itself in raising such a Number of In∣sinuations that clash with each other, and in spiriting up such a Crowd of unwarranted Names to support them. Nor can we but admire at the contradictory Nature of this Proceeding, that Names of Works, which either never were in Being, or never worthy to live, should be produc'd, only to persuade us that the most lasting and beautiful Poem of the Ancients was taken out of them. A Beggar might be content to patch up a Garment
<PB N="10" REF="55"/>
with such Shreds as the World throws away, but it is never to be imagin'd an Emperor would make his Robes of them.</P>
<P>After <HI>Homer</HI> had spent a considerable time in Travel, we find him towards his Age introduc'd to such an Action as tends to his Disparagement. It is not enough to accuse him for spoiling the dead, they raise a living Author by whom he must be baffled in that Qualification on which his Fame is founded.</P>
<P>There is in <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hesiod <HI>Op. &amp; dicrum, l.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 272, &amp;c.</NOTE><HI>Hesiod</HI> an Account of an ancient Poetical Con∣tention at the Funeral of <HI>Amphidamas,</HI> in which, he says, he ob∣tain'd the Prize, but does not mention from whom he carry'd it. There is also among the <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hom. <HI>Hymn.</HI> 2. <HI>ad Venerem.</HI></NOTE><HI>Hymns</HI> ascribed to <HI>Homer,</HI> a Prayer to <HI>Venus,</HI> for Success in a Poetical Dispute, but it neither men∣tions where, nor against whom. But though they have neg∣lected to name their Antagonists, others have since taken care to fill up the Stories by putting them together. The ma∣king two such considerable Names in Poetry engage, carries an amusing Pomp in it, like making two Heroes of the first Rank enter the Lists of Combat. And if <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Hesiod</HI> had their Parties among the <HI>Grammarians,</HI> here was an excellent Oppor∣tunity for <HI>Hesiod</HI>'s Favourers to make a Sacrifice of <HI>Homer.</HI> Hence might a bare Conjecture spread into a <HI>Tradition,</HI> then the Tradition give occasion to an <HI>Epigram,</HI> which is yet extant, and again the <HI>Epigram</HI> (for want of knowing the Time it was writ in) be alledg'd as a <HI>Proof</HI> of that Conjecture from whence it sprung. After this, a <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>whole Treatise was written upon it, which appears not very ancient, because it mentions <HI>Adrian:</HI> The Story agrees in the main with the short Account we find in <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>Banquet of the seven wise Men.</HI></NOTE><HI>Plutarch,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE><HI>Ganictor,</HI> the Son of <HI>Amphidamas,</HI> King of <HI>Euboea,</HI> being us'd to celebrate his Father's funeral Games, invited from all Parts Men famous for Strength and Wisdom.

<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q></P>
<P>To answer this Story, we take notice that <HI>Hesiod</HI> is generally plac'd after <HI>Homer. Graevius,</HI> his own Commentator, sets him a hundred Years lower; and whether he were so or no, yet <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>Symp. l.</HI> 5. §. 2.</NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> has slightly pass'd the whole Account as a Fable. Nay, we may draw an Argument against it from <HI>Hesiod</HI> himself: He had a Love of Fame which caus'd him to engage at the Funeral Games, and which went so far as to make him re∣cord his Conquest in his own Works; Had he defeated <HI>Homer,</HI> the same Principle would have made him mention a Name that could have secur'd his own to Immortality. A Poet who records his Glory, would not omit the noblest Circumstance, and <HI>Homer,</HI> like a Captive Prince, had certainly grac'd the Triumph of his Adversary.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of his Life, there is another Story invented, which makes him conclude it in a manner alto∣gether beneath the Greatness of a Genius. We find in the Life said to be written by <HI>Plutarch,</HI> a Tradition, <Q REND="inline">"That he was warn'd by an Oracle to beware of the young Mens Riddle. This remain'd long obscure to him, 'til he arriv'd at the Island <HI>Io.</HI> There as he sat to behold the Fishermen, they propos'd to him a Riddle in Verse, which he being unable to answer, dy'd for Grief."</Q> This Story refutes itself by car∣rying Superstition at one end, and Folly at the other. It seems conceiv'd with an Air of Derision to lay a great Man in the
<PB N="12" REF="57"/>

But it is the Fate of narrow Capacities to measure Mankind by a false Standard, and imagine the Great, like themselves, capa∣ble of being disconcerted by little Occasions; to frame their malignant Fables according to this Imagination, and to stand detected by it as by an evident Mark of Ignorance.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="58"/>
himself; nay, it is but such an one as they commonly do lead, the highest Stage of which is to be <HI>Master of a School.</HI> But because this is a Treatise to which Writers have had recourse for want of a better, I shall give the following Abstract.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> was born at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> about one hundred sixty eight Years after the Siege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and six hundred twenty two Years before the <HI>Expedition</HI> of <HI>Xerxes.</HI> His Mother's Name was <HI>Crytheis,</HI> who proving unlawfully with Child, was sent away from <HI>Cumae</HI> by her Uncle, with <HI>Ismenias,</HI> one of those who led the Colony to <HI>Smyrna</HI> then building. A while after, as she was celebrating a Festival with other Women on the Banks of the River <HI>Meles,</HI> she was deliver'd of <HI>Homer,</HI> whom she therefore nam'd <HI>Melesigenes.</HI> Upon this she left <HI>Ismenias,</HI> and supported herself by Working, 'til <HI>Phemius</HI> (who taught a School in <HI>Smyrna</HI>) fell in love with her, and marry'd her. But both dying in process of Time, the School fell to <HI>Homer,</HI> who manag'd it with such Wisdom, that he was universally admir'd both by Natives and Strangers. Amongst these latter was <HI>Mentes,</HI> a Master of a Ship from <HI>Leucadia,</HI> by whose Persuasions and Pro∣mises he gave up his School, and went to travel: With him he visited <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> but was left behind at <HI>Ithaca</HI> upon ac∣count of a Defluxion in his Eyes. During his Stay he was en∣tertain'd by one <HI>Mentor,</HI> a Man of Fortune, Justice, and Hospi∣tality, and learn'd the principal Incidents of <HI>Ulysses</HI>'s Life. But at the Return of <HI>Mentes,</HI> he went from thence to <HI>Colophon,</HI> where, his Defluxion renewing, he fell entirely blind. Upon this he could think of no better Expedient than to go back to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where perhaps he might be supported by those who knew him, and have the leisure to addict himself to Poetry. But there he found his Poverty encrease, and his hopes of En∣couragement fail; so that he remov'd for <HI>Cumae,</HI> and by the way was entertain'd for some time at the House of one <HI>Tychius</HI> a Leather-Dresser. At <HI>Cumae</HI> his Poems were wonderfully admir'd, but when he propos'd to eternize their Town if they would al∣low him a Sallary, he was answer'd, That there would be no end of maintaining all the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>blind Men,</HI> and hence he got the Name of <HI>Homer.</HI> From <HI>Cumae</HI> he went to <HI>Phocaea,</HI> where one <HI>Thestorides</HI> (a School-master also) offer'd to maintain him if he would suffer him to transcribe his Verses: This <HI>Homer</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="59"/>
complying with for meer Necessity, the other had no sooner gotten them, but he remov'd to <HI>Chois;</HI> There the Poems gain'd him Wealth and Honour, while the Author himself hardly earn'd his Bread by repeating them. At last, some who came from <HI>Chios</HI> having told the People that the same Verses were publish'd there by a School-master, <HI>Homer</HI> resolv'd to find him out. Having therefore landed near that Place, he was receiv'd by one <HI>Glaucus</HI> a Shepherd (at whose Door he had like to have been worried by Dogs) and carry'd by him to his Master at <HI>Bollissus,</HI> who admi∣ring his Knowledge, entrusted him with the Education of his Children. Here his Praise began to spread, and <HI>Thestorides,</HI> who heard of his Neighbourhood, fled before him. He remov'd however some time afterwards to <HI>Chois,</HI> where he set up a School of Poetry, gain'd a competent Fortune, marry'd a Wife, and had two Daughters, the one of which dy'd young, the other was marry'd to his Patron at <HI>Bollissus.</HI> Here he inserted in his Poems the Names of those to whom he had been most oblig'd, as, <HI>Mentes, Phemius, Mentor,</HI> and <HI>Tychius:</HI> and resolving for <HI>Athens,</HI> he made honourable mention of that City, to prepare the <HI>Athe∣nians</HI> for a kind Reception. But as he went, the Ship put in at <HI>Samos,</HI> where he continu'd the whole Winter, singing at the Houses of great Men, with a Train of Boys after him. In Spring he went on board again in order to prosecute his Journey to <HI>Athens,</HI> but landing by the way at <HI>Ios,</HI> he fell sick, dy'd, and was bury'd on the Sea-Shore.</P>
<P>This is the Life of <HI>Homer</HI> ascrib'd to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> tho' it is wonderful it should be so, since it evidently contradicts his own <HI>History,</HI> by placing <HI>Homer</HI> six hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of <HI>Xerxes;</HI> whereas <HI>Herodotus</HI> himself, who was alive at the time of that Expedition, says <HI>Homer</HI> was only <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>l.</HI> 2.</NOTE>four hundred Years before him. However, if we can imagin that there may be any thing of Truth in the main Parts of this Treatise, we may gather these general Observations from it: That he shew'd a great Thirst of Knowledge, by undertaking such long and numerous Travels; That he manifested an un∣exampled Vigor of Mind, by being able to write with more Fire under the Disadvantages of Blindness, and the utmost Poverty,
<PB N="15" REF="60"/>
than any Poet after him in better Circumstances; And that he had an unlimited Sense of Fame (the Attendant of noble Spirits) which prompted him to engage in new Travels, both under these Disadvantages, and the additional Burthen of old Age.</P>
<P>But it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make some Conjectures, which seem to lay open the Foundation from whence the Traditions which frame the low Lives of <HI>Homer</HI> have arisen. In the first place we may consider, That there are no Historians of his Time (or none handed down to us) who have mention'd him; and that he has never spoken plainly of himself, in those Works which have been ascrib'd to him without Controversy. However, an eager Desire to know something concerning him has occasion'd Mankind to labour the Point under these Disadvantages, and turn on all Hands to see if there were any thing left which might have the least Appearance of Information. Upon the Search, they find no Remains but his <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> and resolve to torture these upon the Rack of Invention, in order to give some account of the Person they belong to.</P>
<P>The first Thing therefore they settle is, That what pass'd for his <HI>Name,</HI> must be his <HI>Name</HI> no longer, but an <HI>additional Title</HI> us'd instead of it. The reason why it was given, must be some Accident of his Life. Having thus found an end of the Clue, they proceed to consider every thing that the word may imply by its Derivation. One finds that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies a <HI>Thigh;</HI> whence arises the Tradition in <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hel. <HI>l.</HI> 3.</NOTE><HI>Heliodorus,</HI> that he was banish'd <HI>Aegypt</HI> for the Mark on that Part, which shew'd a spurious Birth; and this they imagine ground enough to give him the Life of a Wanderer. A second finds that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies an <HI>Hostage,</HI> and then he must be deliver'd as such in a War (ac∣cording to <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Proc. <HI>vis.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Proclus</HI>) between <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Chios.</HI> A third can derive the Name <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>non videns,</HI> from whence he must be a <HI>blind Man</HI> (as in the Piece ascrib'd to <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Herodotus.</HI>) A fourth brings him from <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>speaking</HI> in <HI>Council;</HI> and then (as it is in <HI>Suidas</HI>) he must, by a divine Inspiration, de∣clare to the <HI>Smyrnaeans,</HI> that they should war against <HI>Colophon.</HI> A fifth finds the word may be brought to signify <HI>following others,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="61"/>
or <HI>joining himself</HI> to them, and then he must be call'd <HI>Homer</HI> for saying (as it is quoted from <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Plut. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Aristotle</HI> in the Life ascrib'd to <HI>Plutarch</HI>) that he would <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>follow</HI> the <HI>Lydians</HI> from <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Thus has the Name been turn'd and winded enough at least to give a Suspicion, that he who got a <HI>new Etymology,</HI> got a handle either for a <HI>new Life</HI> of him, or something which he added to the old one.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Name</HI> itself not affording enough to furnish out a whole Life, his <HI>Works</HI> must be brought in for Assistance, and it is taken for granted, That where he has not spoken of him∣self, he lies veil'd beneath the Persons or Actions of those whom he describes. Because he calls a Poet by the Name of <HI>Phemius</HI> in his <HI>Odysses,</HI> they conclude this <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Herod. <HI>vit.</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Phemius</HI> was his Master. Because he speaks of <HI>Demodocus</HI> as another Poet who was blind, and fre∣quented Palaces, he must be sent about <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>blind, to sing at the Doors of rich Men. If <HI>Ulysses</HI> be set upon by Dogs at his Shepherd's Cottage, because this is a low Adventure, it is thought to be his own at <HI>Bollissus.</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>And if he calls the Leather-dresser, who made <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Shield, by the Name of <HI>Tychius,</HI> he has been supported by such an one in his Wants: Nay, some have been so vio∣lently carry'd into this way of conjecturing, that the bare <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. M.</HI> Dacier<HI>'s Life of</HI> Homer.</NOTE><HI>Si∣mile</HI> of a Woman who works hard for her Livelihood, is said to have been borrow'd from his Mother's Condition, and brought as a Proof of it. Thus he is still imagin'd to intend himself; and the Fictions of Poetry, converted into real Facts, are deliver'd for his Life, who has assign'd them to others. All those Sto∣ries in his Works which suit with a mean Condition are suppos'd to have happen'd to him, tho' the same way of Inference might as well prove him to have acted in a higher Sphere, from the many Passages that shew his Skill in Government, and his Knowledge of the great Parts of Life.</P>
<P>There are some other scatter'd Stories of <HI>Homer</HI> which fall not under these Heads, but are however of as trifling a Nature; as much unfit for the Materials of History, still more unground∣ed, if possible, and arising merely from Chance, or the Hu∣mours of Men: Such is the Report we meet with from <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Diogenes Lacrtius <HI>ex</HI> Heracl. <HI>in vita</HI> Socratis.</NOTE><HI>Hera∣clides,</HI>

That <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Homer</HI> was fin'd at <HI>Athens</HI> for a Madman;"</Q> which seems invented by the Disciples of <HI>Socrates</HI> to cast an Odium upon the <HI>Athenians</HI> for their consenting to the Death of their Master, and carries in it something like a declaiming Re∣venge of the Schools, as if the World should imagine the <HI>one</HI> could be esteem'd <HI>mad,</HI> where the <HI>other</HI> was put to Death for being <HI>wicked.</HI> Such another Report is that in <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Aelian. <HI>l.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 15.</NOTE><HI>Aelian,</HI> That <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Homer</HI> portion'd his Daughter with some of his Works for want of Money;"</Q> which looks but like a Whim deliver'd in the Gaiety of Fancy; a Jest upon a poor Wit, which at first might have had an Epigrammatist for its Father, and been af∣terwards gravely understood by some painful Collector. In short, Mankind have labour'd heartily about him to no purpose; they have caught up every thing greedily, with that busy minute Curiosity and unsatisfactory Inquisitiveness which <HI>Seneca</HI> calls the <HI>Disease of the</HI> Greeks; they have puzzled the Cause by their Attempts to find it out; and, like Travellers entirely destitute of a Road, yet resolv'd to make it over unpassable Deserts, they superinduce Error, instead of removing Ignorance.</P>

But not to trouble our selves with entring into all the dry Dispute, we may here take notice, that the World is inclin'd to stand by the <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Dacier, Du Pin, <HI>&amp;c. concerning the</HI> Arundelian Marble.</NOTE><HI>Arun∣delian Marble,</HI> as the most certain Computation of those early Times; and this, by placing him at the time when <HI>Diog∣netus</HI> rul'd in <HI>Athens,</HI> makes him flourish a little before the <HI>Olympiads</HI> were establish'd; about three hundred Years after the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> and near a thousand before the <HI>Chri∣stian Aera.</HI> For a farther Confirmation of this, we have some great Names of Antiquity, who give him a Cotem∣porary agreeing with the Computation. <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cicero <HI>Qu.

As for the <HI>Athenians,</HI> they challeng'd him as born where they had a <HI>Colony;</HI> or else in behalf of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, and as the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of its Learning, they made his Name free of their City, (<HI>qu.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Travels.</NOTE> When he was of riper Years, for his farther Accomplishment, and the Gratification of his Thirst of Knowledge, he spent a considerable part of his time in travelling. Upon which ac∣count, <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Procl. <HI>vita</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Proclus</HI> has taken notice that he must have abounded in Riches: <Q REND="inline">"For long Travels, says he, occasion high Expen∣ces, and especially at those times when Men could neither sail without imminent Danger and Inconveniences, nor had a regulated manner of Commerce with one another."</Q> This way of reasoning appears very probable; and if it does not prove him to have been rich, it shews him, at least, to have had Patrons of a generous Spirit, who, observing the Vastness of his Capacity, believ'd themselves beneficent to Mankind, while they supported one who seem'd born for something ex∣traordinary.</P>
<P><HI>Aegypt</HI> being at that time the Seat of Learning, the greatest Wits and Genius's of <HI>Greece</HI> us'd to travel thither. Among these <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Diod Sic. <HI>l.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Diodorus</HI> reckons <HI>Homer,</HI> and to strengthen his Opinion, alledges that Multitude of their Notions which he has receiv'd into his Poetry, and of their Customs, to which he alludes in his Fictions: Such as his <HI>Gods,</HI> which are nam'd from the first <HI>Aegyptian Kings;</HI> the Number of the <HI>Muses</HI> taken from the <HI>nine Minstrels</HI> which attended <HI>Osyris;</HI> the <HI>Feast</HI> wherein they us'd to send their Statues of the Deities into <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and to return after twelve Days; and the carrying their <HI>dead Bodies</HI> over the Lake to a pleasant Place call'd <HI>Acherusia</HI> near <HI>Mem∣phis,</HI> from whence arose the Stories of <HI>Charon, Styx,</HI> and <HI>Ely∣sium.</HI> These are Notions which so abound in him, as to make <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <BIBL>Herodot. <HI>l.</HI> 2.</BIBL></Q></NOTE><HI>Herodotus</HI> say, He had introduc'd from thence the <HI>Religion</HI> of
<PB N="23" REF="68"/>
<HI>Greece.</HI> And if others have believ'd he was an <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> from his Knowledge of their Rites and Traditions which were re∣veal'd but to few; and of the Arts and Customs which were pra∣ctis'd among them in general; it may prove at least thus much, that he was there in his Travels.</P>
<P>As <HI>Greece</HI> was in all Probability his native Country, and had then began to make an Effort for Learning, we cannot doubt but he travel'd there also, with a particular Observation. He uses the different <HI>Dialects</HI> which were spoken in its different Parts, as one who had been conversant with them all. But the Argu∣ment which appears most irrefragable, is to be taken from his <HI>Ca∣talogue</HI> of the <HI>Ships:</HI> He has there given us an exact <HI>Geography</HI> of <HI>Greece;</HI> where its Cities, Mountains, and Plains, are parti∣cularly mention'd; where the Courses of its Rivers are trac'd out; where the Countrys are laid in order, their Bounds assign'd, and the uses of their Soils specify'd; which the An∣cients, who compar'd it with the Original, have allow'd to be so true in all Points, that it could never have been owing to a loose and casual Information. Even <HI>Strabo</HI>'s Account of <HI>Greece</HI> is but a kind of Commentary upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s.</P>
<P>We may carry this Argument farther, to suppose his having been round <HI>Asia Minor,</HI> from his exact Division of the <HI>Regnum Priami vetus</HI> (as <HI>Horace</HI> calls it) into its separate <HI>Dynasties,</HI> and the Account he gives of the bordering Nations in Alliance with it. Perhaps too, in the Wandrings of <HI>Ulysses</HI> about <HI>Sicily,</HI> whose Ports and neighbouring Islands are mention'd, he might con∣trive to send his Heroe where he had made his own Voyage before. Nor will the Fables he has intermingled be any Obje∣ction to his having travel'd in those Parts, since they are not related as the History of the present time, but the Tradition of the former. His mention of <HI>Thrace,</HI> his Description of the Beasts of <HI>Lybia,</HI> and of the Climate in the <HI>Fortunate Islands,</HI> may seem also to give us a view of him in the Extreams of the Earth, where it was not barbarous or uninhabited. It is hard to set limits to the Travels of a Man, who has set none to that desire of Knowledge which made him undertake them. Who can say what People he has not seen, who appears to be vers'd in the Customs of all? He takes the Globe for the Scene in which he introduces his Subjects; he launches forward intre∣pidly,
<PB N="24" REF="69"/>
like one to whom no place is new, and appears a Citi∣zen of the World in general.</P>
<P>When he return'd from his Travels, he seems to have apply'd himself to the finishing his Poems, however he might have ei∣ther design'd, begun, or pursu'd them before. In these he has treasur'd up his various Acquisitions of Knowledge, where they have been preserv'd through Ages, to be as well the Proofs of his own Industry, as the Instructions of Posterity. He might then describe his Sacrifices after the <HI>Aeolian</HI> manner; or <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Iliad 3.</NOTE>his Leagues with a Mixture of <HI>Trojan</HI> and <HI>Spartan</HI> Ceremonies: <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Il. 2. ℣. 145.</NOTE>He could then compare the Confusion of a Multitude to that Tu∣mult he had observ'd in the <HI>Icarian</HI> Sea, dashing and break∣ing among its Crowd of Islands: He could represent the Num∣bers of an Army, by those Flocks of <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Iliad 2. ℣. 461.</NOTE>Swans he had seen on the Banks of the <HI>Cayster;</HI> or being to describe that Heat of Battel with which <HI>Achilles</HI> drove the <HI>Trojans</HI> into the River, <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Il. 21. ℣. 12.</NOTE>he could illustrate it with an Allusion from <HI>Cyrene</HI> or <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where, when the Inhabitants burn'd their Fields, the Grass-hoppers fled before the Fire to perish in the Ocean. His Fancy being fully replenish'd, might supply him with every proper occasional Image, and his Soul after having enlarg'd itself, and taken in an exten∣sive Variety of the Creation, might be equal to the Task of an <HI>Iliad</HI> and an <HI>Odysses.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> old Age <HI>and</HI> Death.</NOTE> In his <HI>Age,</HI> we hear he fell blind, and settled at <HI>Chios,</HI> as he says in the <HI>Hymn</HI> to <HI>Apollo,</HI> which (as is before observ'd) is acknowledg'd for his by <HI>Thucydides,</HI> and might occasion both <HI>Simonides</HI> and <HI>Theocritus</HI> to call him a <HI>Chian.</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>l.</HI> 10.</NOTE><HI>Strabo</HI> relates, That <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the great Legislator of <HI>Sparta,</HI> was reported to have gone to <HI>Chios</HI> to have a Conference with <HI>Homer,</HI> after he had study'd the Laws of <HI>Crete</HI> and <HI>Aegypt</HI> in order to form his Constitutions. If this be true, how much a nobler Represen∣tation does it give of him, and indeed more agreeable to what we conceive of this mighty Genius, than those spurious Accounts which keep him down among the meanest of Mankind? What an Idea could we frame to our selves of a Conversation, held between two Persons so considerable; a Philosopher conscious of the Force of Poetry, and a Poet knowing in the Depths of
<PB N="25" REF="70"/>
Philosophy; both their Souls improv'd with Learning, both emi∣nently rais'd above little Designs, or the meaner kind of Interest, and meeting together to consult the Good of Mankind? But in this, I have only indulg'd a Thought which is not to be insisted upon; the Evidence of History rather tends to prove that <HI>Ly∣curgus</HI> brought his Works from <HI>Asia</HI> after his Death: which <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Procl. <HI>vitâ</HI> Hom.</NOTE><HI>Proclus</HI> imagines to have happen'd at a great old Age, on ac∣count of his Circumference of Learning, for which a short Life could never suffice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Chara∣cter <HI>and</HI> Manners.</NOTE> If we would now make a Conjecture concerning the Genius and Temper of this great Man; perhaps his Works, which would not furnish us with Facts for his Life, will be more reasonably made use of to give us a Picture of his Mind: To this end there∣fore, we may suffer the very Name and Notion of a Book to vanish for a while, and look upon what is left us as a Conver∣sation, in order to gain an Acquaintance with <HI>Homer.</HI> Perhaps the general Air of his Works will become the general Character of his Genius, and the particular Observations give some Light to the particular Turns of his Temper. His comprehensive Know∣ledge shews that his Soul was not form'd like a narrow Chanel for a single Stream, but as an Expanse which might receive an Ocean into its Bosom; that he had the strongest Desire of Improve∣ment, and an unbounded Curiosity, which made its Advantage of every transient Circumstance, or obvious Accident. His solid and sententious Manner may make us admire him for a Man of Judgment; one who, in the darkest Ages, could enter far into a Disquisition of human Nature; who, notwithstanding all the Changes which Governments, Manners, Rites, and even the Notions of Virtue have undergone, could still abound with so many Maxims correspondent to Truth, and Notions applicable to so many Sciences. The Fire, which is so observable in his Poem, as to give every thing the most active Appearance, may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm Temper, and lively Behaviour; and the pleasurable Air which every where overspreads it, may give us reason to think, that Fire of Imagination was temper'd with Sweetness and Affability. If we farther observe the Particulars he treats of, and imagine that
<PB N="26" REF="71"/>
he laid a Stress upon the Sentiments he delivers, pursuant to his real Opinions; we shall take him to be of a religious Spirit, by his inculcating in almost every Page the worship of the Gods. We shall imagine him to be a generous Lover of his Countrey, from his care to extol it every where: which is carry'd to such a heighth, as to make <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Plutarch <HI>de Aud. Poetis.</HI></NOTE><HI>Plutarch</HI> observe, That though many of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> are made Prisoners or Suppliants, yet nei∣ther of these disgraceful Accidents (which are common to all Nations in War) ever happens to one <HI>Greek</HI> throughout his Works. We shall take him to be a compassionate Lover of Mankind, from his numberless Praises of Hospitality and Charity; (if indeed we are not to account for 'em, as the com∣mon Writers of his Life imagine, from his owing his Support to these Virtues.) It might seem from his Love of Stories, with his manner of telling them sometimes, that he gave his own Picture when he painted his <HI>Nestor,</HI> and, as wise as he was, was no Enemy to Talking. One would think from his Praises of Wine, his copious Goblets, and pleasing Descriptions of Ban∣quets, that he was addicted to a chearful, sociable Life, which <HI>Horace</HI> takes notice of as a kind of Tradition;
<Q><L>"Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus <HI>Homerus.</HI>"</L>
<BIBL><HI>Ep.</HI> 19. <HI>l.</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q>
And that he was not (as may be guess'd of <HI>Virgil</HI> from his Works) averse to the <HI>Female Sex,</HI> will appear from his care to paint them amiably upon all occasions: His <HI>Andromache</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> are in each of his Poems most shining Characters of conjugal Affection; even his <HI>Helena</HI> herself is drawn with all the Softnings imaginable; his Souldiers are exhorted to combat with the hopes of <HI>Women;</HI> his Commanders are furnish'd with <HI>fair Slaves</HI> in their Tents, nor is the venerable <HI>Nestor</HI> without a <HI>Mistress.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that in this way of turning a <HI>Book</HI> into a <HI>Man,</HI> this reasoning from his Works to himself, we can at best but hit off a few Out-strokes of a Character: Wherefore I shall decline the carrying it into more minute Points, and conclude with one <HI>Discovery</HI> which we may make from his <HI>Silence,</HI> a Dis∣covery extreamly proper to be made in this manner, which is, that he was of a very modest Temper. There is in all
<PB N="27" REF="72"/>
other Poets a Custom of speaking of themselves, and a Vanity of promising Eternity to their Writings: In both which <HI>Homer,</HI> who has the best Title to speak out, is altogether silent. As to the last of them, the World has made him am∣ple Recompence; it has given him that Eternity he would not promise himself: But whatever Endeavours have been offer'd in respect of the former, we find our selves still under an irrepa∣rable Loss. That which others have said of him has amounted to no more than Conjecture; that which I have said is no far∣ther to be insisted on: I have us'd the liberty which is indulg'd me by Precedent, to give in my Opinions among the Accounts of others, and the World may be pleas'd to receive them as so many willing Endeavours to gratify its Curiosity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Catalogue of his Works.</HI></NOTE> The only uncontestable Works which <HI>Homer</HI> has left behind him are the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Odysses:</HI> The <HI>Batrachomuomachia</HI> or <HI>Battle of the Frogs and Mice,</HI> has been disputed, but is however allow'd for his by many great Authorities; amongst whom <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Statius <HI>Pres. ad Sylu.</HI> 1</NOTE><HI>Sta∣tius</HI> has reckon'd it like the <HI>Culex</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> a Trial of his Force before his larger Performances.

<P>The <HI>Epigrams</HI> are extracted out of the Life said to be written by <HI>Herodotus,</HI> and we leave them as such to stand or fall with it; except the Epitaph on <HI>Midas,</HI> which is of very an∣cient Authority, quoted without its Author both by <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Plat. <HI>in</HI> Phaed.</NOTE><HI>Plato</HI> and <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Longin. §.36. <HI>Edit.</HI> Tollii.</NOTE><HI>Longinus,</HI> and (according to <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Laertius <HI>in vita</HI> Cleobuli.</NOTE><HI>Laertius</HI>) ascrib'd by <HI>Simonides</HI> to <HI>Cleobulus</HI> the wise Man; who living long after <HI>Homer</HI> answers better to the Age of <HI>Midas</HI> the Son of <HI>Gordias.</HI></P>

<P>HAVING now finish'd what was propos'd concerning the History of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Life, I shall proceed to that of his Works; and considering him no longer as a <HI>Man,</HI> but as an <HI>Author,</HI> prosecute the Thread of his Story in this his second Life, thro' the different Degrees of Esteem which those Writings have obtain'd in different Periods of Time.</P>
<P>It has been the fortune of several great Genius's not to be known while they liv'd, either for want of Historians, the Meanness of Fortune, or the Love of Retirement, to which a Poetical Temper is peculiarly addicted. Yet after Death their Works give themselves a Life in Fame, without the help of an Historian; and, notwithstanding the Meanness of their Author, or his Love of Retreat, they go forth among Mankind, the Glories of that Age which produc'd them, and the Delight of those which follow it.

As he propos'd to himself that the Constitution he would raise upon this their Union should be of a martial Nature, these Poems were of an extraordinary Value to him: for they came with a full Force into his Scheme; the Moral they inspir'd was Unity; the Air they breath'd was Martial; and their Story had this particular Engagement for the <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> that it shew'd <HI>Greece</HI> in War, and <HI>Asia</HI> subdu'd under the Conduct of one of their own Monarchs, who commanded all the <HI>Graecian</HI> Princes. Thus the Poet both pleas'd the Law-giver, and the People: from whence he had a double Influence when the Laws were settled. For his Poem then became a Panegyrick on their Constitution, as well as a Register of their Glory; and confirm'd them in the Love of it by a gallant Descri∣ption of those Qualities and Actions for which it was adapted.

Whatever was serious or magnificent made a part of his Sub∣ject: War and Peace were the comprehensive Division in which he consider'd the World; and the Plans of his Poems were founded on the most active Scenes of each, the Adven∣tures of a Siege, and the Accidents of a Voyage. For these his Spirit was equally active and various, lofty in Expression, clear in Narration, natural in Description, rapid in Action, abundant in Figures. If ever he appears less than himself, it is from the Time he writ in; and if he runs into Errors, it is from an Excess, rather than a Defect of Genius. Thus he rose over the Poetical World, shining out like a Sun all at once, which if it sometimes make too <HI>faint</HI> an Appearance, 'tis to be ascrib'd only to the necessity of the Season that keeps it at a distance; and if he is sometimes too <HI>violent,</HI> we confess at the same time that we owe all things to his Heat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theology.</NOTE> As for his <HI>Theology,</HI> we see the Heathen System entirely follow'd. This was all he could then have to work upon, and where he fails of Truth for want of Revelation he at least shows his Knowledge in his own Religion by the Traditions he delivers. But we are now upon a Point to be farther handled, because the greatest Controversy concerning the Merit of <HI>Homer</HI> depends upon it. Let us consider then that there was an Age in <HI>Greece,</HI> when natural Reason only discover'd there must be something superior to us, and Tradition had af∣fix'd the Notion to a Number of Deities. At this time <HI>Homer</HI> rose with the finest Turn imaginable for Poetry, who design∣ing
<PB N="43" REF="88"/>
to instruct Mankind in the manner for which he was most adapted, writ Poems wherein he made use of the Mi∣nistry of the Gods to give the highest Air of Surprize and Veneration to his Writings. He found the Religion of Man∣kind wrapt up in Fables; it was thought then the easiest way to convey Morals to the People, who were allur'd to Attention by Pleasure, and aw'd with the Opinion of a hidden Mystery. Nor was it his Business when he undertook the Province of a Poet (not of a meer Philosopher) to be the first who should discard That which furnishes Poetry with its most beautiful Appearance: and especially since the Age he liv'd in, by discovering its Taste, had not only given him Autho∣rity, but even put him under the necessity of preserving it. Whatever therefore he might think of his Gods, he took them as he found them: he brought them into Action accord∣ing to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in some Stories as they were then believ'd; unless we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers. Yet there are several Rays of Truth streaming through all this Darkness, in those Senti∣ments he entertains concerning the Gods; and several <HI>Alle∣gories</HI> lightly veil'd over, from whence the learned drew new Knowledges, each according to his Power of Penetration and Fancy. But that we may the better comprehend him in all the Parts of this general View, let us extract from him a Scheme of his Religion.</P>
<P>He has a <HI>Jupiter,</HI> a <HI>Father of Gods and Men,</HI> whom he makes supream, and to whom he applies several Attri∣butes, as Wisdom, Justice, Knowledge, Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are essentially inherent to the Idea of a God. <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Iliad 24. ℣. 527.</NOTE>He has given him two <HI>Vessels,</HI> out of which he distributes natural <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil</HI> for the Life of Man; he places the Gods in Council round him; he makes <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Il. 9. ℣. 498.</NOTE><HI>Prayers</HI> pass to and fro before him; and Mankind adore him with Sacrifice. But all this grand Appearance, wherein Poetry paid a deference to Reason, is dash'd and mingled with the Imperfection of our Nature; not only with the applying our Passions to the su∣preme Being (for Men have always been treated with this
<PB N="44" REF="89"/>
Complyance to their Notions) but that he is not even ex∣empted from our common Appetites and Frailties: For he is made to eat, drink, and sleep: but this his Admirers would imagine to be only a grosser way of representing a general Notion of Happiness, because he says in one place,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Il. 5. ℣. 340.</NOTE> that the Food of the Gods was not of the same Nature with ours. But upon the whole, while he endeavour'd to speak of a Deity without a right Information, he was forc'd to take him from that Image he discover'd in <HI>Man;</HI> and (like one who being dazled with the Sun in the Heavens, would view him as he is reflected in a River) he has taken off the Impression not only ruffled with the Emotion of our Passions, but obscur'd with the earthy Mixture of our Natures.</P>
<P>The other Gods have all their Provinces assign'd 'em: <Q REND="inline">"Every thing has its peculiar Deity, says <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Maxim. Tyrius, <HI>Diss.</HI> 16.</NOTE><HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> by which <HI>Homer</HI> would insinuate that the Godhead was present to all things."</Q> When they are consider'd farther, we find he has turn'd the Virtues and Endowments of our Minds into <HI>Persons,</HI> to make the Springs of Action become visible; and because they are given by the Gods, he re∣presents them as Gods themselves descending from Heaven. In the same strong Light he shows our Vices when they oc∣casion Misfortunes, like extraordinary Powers which inflict them upon us, and even our natural Punishments are represented as Punishers themselves. But when we come to see the man∣ner they are introduc'd in, they are found feasting, fighting, wounded by Men, and shedding a sort of Blood; in which his Machines play a little too grosly: the Fable which was admitted to procure the Pleasure of Surprize, violently op∣presses the Allegory, and it may be lost labour to search for it in every minute Circumstance, if indeed it was intended to be there. The main Design was however Philosophical, the Dress the Poet's, which is us'd for necessity and allow'd to be ornamental. And there will be something still to be of∣fer'd in his Defence, if he has both preserved the grand Moral from being obscur'd, and adorn'd the Parts of his Works with such Sentiments of the Gods as belong'd to the Age he liv'd
<PB N="45" REF="90"/>
in; which that he did, appears from his having then had that Success for which Allegory was contriv'd. <Q REND="inline">"It is the Madness of Man, says <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Maxim. Tyr. <HI>Diss.</HI> 29.</NOTE><HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> to dis-esteem what is plain and admire what is hidden; This the Poets dis∣covering invented the Fable for a Remedy, when they treated of holy Matters; which being more obscure than Conversation, and more clear than the Riddle, is a Mean between Knowledge and Ignorance; believ'd partly for being agreeable, and partly for being wonderful. Thus as Poets in Name, and Philosophers in Effect, they drew Mankind gradually to a search after Truth, when the Name of Phi∣losopher would have been harsh and displeasing."</Q></P>
<P>When <HI>Homer</HI> proceeds to tell us our Duty to these supe∣rior Beings, we find Prayer, Sacrifice, Lustration, and all the Rites which were esteem'd religious, constantly recommended under fear of their Displeasure. We find too a Notion of the Soul's subsisting after this Life, but for want of Revelation he knows not what to reckon the Happiness of a future State, to any one who was not deify'd: Which is plain from the Speech of <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Odyss. 11. ℣. 488.</NOTE><HI>Achilles</HI> to <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the Region of the dead; where he tells him, that <Q REND="inline">"he would rather serve the poorest Creature upon Earth than rule over all the departed."</Q> It was chiefly for this Reason that <HI>Plato</HI> excluded him his Com∣mon-Wealth; he thought <HI>Homer</HI> spoke indecently of the Gods, and dreadfully of a future State; in which Sentence he has made no Allowance for the Times he writ in. But if he can not be defended in every thing as a Theologist, yet we may say in respect of his Poetry, that he has enrich'd it from Theology with true Sentiments for Profit, adorn'd it with Allegories for Pleasure, and by using some Machines which have no farther Significancy or are so refin'd as to make it doubted if they have any, he has however produc'd that Character in Poetry which we call the <HI>Marvellous,</HI> and from which the <HI>Agreeable</HI> (according to <HI>Aristotle</HI>) is always inseparable.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Politicks.</NOTE> If we take the State of <HI>Greece</HI> at his time in a <HI>Political</HI> View, we find it a <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Thucydides, <HI>lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE> disunited Country, made up of small
<PB N="46" REF="91"/>
States; and whatever was manag'd in War amounted to no more than intestine Skirmishes or Pyracies abroad, which were easily reveng'd on account of their Disunion. Thus one People stole <HI>Europa,</HI> and another <HI>Io;</HI> the <HI>Graecians</HI> took <HI>Hesione</HI> from <HI>Troy,</HI> and the <HI>Trojans</HI> took <HI>Helena</HI> from <HI>Greece</HI> in Revenge. But this last having greater Friends and Alliances than any upon whom the Rapes had hitherto fallen, the Ruin of <HI>Troy</HI> was the Consequence; and the Force of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> Coasts was so broken, that this Accident put an end to the Age of Pyracies. Then the intestine Broils of <HI>Greece</HI> (which had been discontinued during the League) were renew'd upon its Dissolution. War and Sedition mov'd People from Place to Place during its want of Inhabitants; Exiles from one Country were receiv'd for Kings in another; and Leaders took Tracts of Ground to bestow them upon their Followers. Commerce was neglected, living at home unsafe, and no∣thing of Moment tranfacted by any but against their Neigh∣bours: <HI>Athens</HI> only, where the People were undisturb'd be∣cause it was a barren Soil which no Body coveted, had begun to send Colonies abroad, being over-stock'd with Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Now a Poem coming out at so seasonable a Time, with a Moral capable of healing these Disorders by promoting <HI>Union,</HI> we may reasonably think it was design'd for that End to which it is so peculiarly adapted. If we ima∣gine therefore that <HI>Homer</HI> was a Politician in this Affair, we may suppose him to have look'd back into the Ages past, to see if at any time the Disorder had been less; and to have pitch'd upon that Story wherein it found a temporary Cure, that by celebrating it with all possible Honour he might in∣stil a Desire of the same sort of Union into the Hearts of his Countrymen. This indeed was a Work which could belong to none but a Poet, when Governors had Power only over small Territories, and the numerous Governments were every way independent. It was then that all the Charms of Poetry were call'd forth to insinuate the important Glory of an Alli∣ance, and the <HI>Iliad</HI> deliver'd from the <HI>Muses</HI> with all the Pomp of Words and artificial Influence. Union among themselves was recommended, Peace at home, and Glory abroad: And lest this should be render'd useless by Misma∣nagements,
<PB N="47" REF="92"/>
he lets us into farther Lessons concerning it. How when his Kings quarrel, their Subjects suffer; when they act in Conjunction, Victory attends them. When they meet in Council, Plans are drawn and Provisions made for future Action; and when in the Field, the Arts of War are describ'd with the greatest Exactness. These were Lectures of general Concern to Mankind, proper for the Poet to de∣liver and Kings to attend to; such as made <HI>Porphyry</HI> write of the Profit that Princes might receive from <HI>Homer;</HI> and <HI>Stratocles, Hermias,</HI> and <HI>Frontinus</HI> extract military Discipline out of him. Thus tho' <HI>Plato</HI> has banish'd him from one imaginary Commonwealth, he has still been serviceable to many real Kingdoms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Morality.</NOTE> The <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Greece</HI> could not be perfect while there was a Weakness in its Government; Faults in Politicks are oc∣casion'd by Faults in Ethicks, and occasion them in their turn. The Division into so many States was the rise of fre∣quent Quarrels, whereby Men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable Disposition. Bodily Strength met with the greatest Honours, because it was daily necessary to the Subsistence of little Governments; and that headlong Courage which throws itself forward to Enterprize and Plunder, was universally caress'd, because it carry'd all things before it. It is no wonder in an Age of such Education and Customs, that, as <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. <HI>lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Thucydides</HI> says, <Q REND="inline">"Robbing was honour'd, provided it were done with Gallantry, and that the ancient Poets made People question one another as they sail'd by, <HI>if they were Thieves?</HI> as a thing for which no one ought either to be scorn'd or upbraided."</Q> These were the sort of Acti∣ons which the Singers then recorded, and it was out of such an Age that <HI>Homer</HI> was to take his Subjects. For this reason (not a want of Morality in him) we see a boasting Temper and unmanag'd Roughness in the Spirit of his Heroes, which ran out in Pride, Anger, or Cruelty. It is not in him as in our modern <HI>Romances,</HI> where Men are drawn in Per∣fection, and we but read with a tender Weakness what we can neither apply nor emulate. <HI>Homer</HI> writ for Men, and there∣fore
<PB N="48" REF="93"/>
he writ of them; if the World had been better, he would have shown it so; as the Matter now stands, we see his Peo∣ple with the turn of his Age, insatiably thirsting after Glory and Plunder; for which however he has found them a law∣ful Cause, and taken care to retard their Success by those very Faults.</P>
<P>In the Prosecution of the Story every Part of it has its Lessons of Morality: There is brotherly Love in <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Menelaus,</HI> Friendship in <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and the Love of his Country in <HI>Hector.</HI> But since we have spoken of the <HI>Iliad</HI> as more particular for its Politicks, we may con∣sider the <HI>Odysses</HI> as its Moral is more directly fram'd for Ethicks. It carries the Heroe through a world of Trials both of the dangerous and pleasurable Nature. It shows him first under most surprizing Weights of Adversity, among Ship∣wrecks and Savages; all these he is made to pass through in the Methods by which it becomes a Man to conquer; a Pa∣tience in suffering, and a Presence of Mind in every Accident. It shows him again in another View, tempted with the Baits of idle or unlawful Pleasures, and then points out the Me∣thods of being safe from them. But if in general we consider the care our Author has taken to fix his Lessons of Morality by the Proverbs and Precepts he delivers, we shall not won∣der if <HI>Greece</HI> which afterwards gave the Appellation of <HI>Wise</HI> to Men who settled <HI>single Sentences</HI> of Truth, should give him the Title of the <HI>Father of Virtue</HI> for introducing such a Number. To be brief, if we take the Opinion of <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Qui quid sit pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</L>
<L>Plenius &amp; melius Chrysippo &amp; Crantore dicit.</L>
<BIBL>Hor. <HI>Ep.</HI> 2. <HI>lib</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q></NOTE><HI>Horace,</HI> he has propos'd him to us as a Master of Morality; he lays down the common Philosophical Division of <HI>Good</HI> into <HI>plea∣sant, profitable,</HI> and <HI>honest;</HI> and then asserts that <HI>Homer</HI> has more fully and clearly instructed us in each of them, than the most rigid Philosophers.</P>
<P>Some indeed have thought notwithstanding all this, that <HI>Homer</HI> had only a design to please in his Inventions; and that others have since extracted Morals out of his Stories (and indeed all Stories are capable of being us'd so.) But this is an
<PB N="49" REF="94"/>
Opinion concerning Poetry which the World has rather dege∣nerated into, than begun with. The Traditions of <HI>Orpheus</HI>'s civilizing Mankind by Hymns on the Gods, with others of the like Nature, may show there was a better use of the Art both known and practis'd. There is also a remarkable Pas∣sage of this kind in the third Book of the <HI>Odysses,</HI> that <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> left one of the <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Odyss. 3. ℣. 267.</NOTE>Poets of his Times in the Court when he sail'd for <HI>Troy;</HI> and that his Queen was preserv'd virtuous by his Songs, 'till <HI>Aegysthus</HI> was forc'd to expel him in order to debauch her. Here he has hinted what a true Poetical Spirit can do when apply'd to the Promotion of Virtue; and from this one may judge he could not but design That him∣self, which he recommends as the Duty and Merit of his Pro∣fession. Others since his Time may have seduc'd the Art to worse Intentions; but they who are offended at the Liberties of some Poets, should not judge all in the gross for trifling or Corruption; especially when the Evidence runs so strongly for any One to the contrary.</P>
<P>We may in general go on to observe, that the time when <HI>Homer</HI> was born did not abound in Learning. For where∣ever Politicks and Morality is weak, it wants its peaceable Air to thrive in, and that Opportunity which is not known in the Ages of unsettled Life. He is himself the Man from whom we have the first Accounts of Antiquity, either in its Actions or Learning; from whom we hear what <HI>Aegypt</HI> or <HI>Greece</HI> could inform him in, and whatever himself could dis∣cover by the Strength of Nature or Industry. But however that we may not mistake the Elogies of those Ancients who call him the <HI>Father of Arts and Sciences,</HI> and be surpriz'd to find so little of them (as they are now in Perfection) in his Works; we should know that this Character is not to be un∣derstood at large, as if he had included the full and regular Systems of every thing: He is to be consider'd professedly only in Quality of a Poet; this was his Business, to which, as whatever he knew was to be subservient, so he has not fail'd to introduce those Strokes of Knowledge from the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences, which the Subject de∣manded
<PB N="50" REF="95"/>
either for Necessity or Ornament. This will appear on a fair View of him in each of these Lights.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History.</NOTE> Before his Time there were no <HI>Historians</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> He treated Historically of past Transactions, according as he could be inform'd by Tradition, Song, or whatever Method there was of preserving their Memory. For this we have the Consent of Antiquity; they have generally more appeal'd to his Au∣thority, and more insisted on it than on the Testimony of any other Writer, when they treat of the Rites, Customs, and Manners of the first Times. They have generally believ'd that the Acts of <HI>Tydeus</HI> at <HI>Thebes,</HI> the second Siege of that City, the Settlement of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> the Battel between the <HI>Curetes</HI> and the <HI>Aetolians,</HI> the Account of the Kings of <HI>Mycenae</HI> by the Sceptre of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> the Acts of the <HI>Greeks</HI> at <HI>Troy,</HI> and many other such Accounts, are some of them wholly preserv'd by him, and the rest as faithfully related as by any Historian. Nor perhaps was all of his Invention which seems to be feign'd, but rather frequently the obscure Traces and Remains of real Persons and Actions; which as <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>l.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>Strabo</HI> observes, when History was transmitted by Oral Tradition, might be mix'd with Fable before it came into the Hands of the Poet. <Q REND="inline">"This happen'd (says he) to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the first professed Historian, who is often as fabulous as <HI>Homer</HI> when he defers to the common Reports of Countreys; and it is not to be reckon'd to either as a fault, but as a necessity of the Times."</Q> Nay, the very Passages which cause us to tax them at this distance with being fabulous, might be occasion'd by their Diligence, and a fear of erring, if they too hastily rejected those Reports which had pass'd current in the Nations they describ'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geography.</NOTE> Before his Time there was no such thing as <HI>Geography</HI> in <HI>Greece.</HI> For this we have the Suffrage of <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>ibid. initio.</HI></NOTE><HI>Strabo</HI> the best of Geographers, who approves the Opinion of <HI>Hipparchus</HI> and other Ancients, that <HI>Homer</HI> was the very Author of it; and upon this Account begins his Treatise of the Science itself with an <HI>Encomium</HI> on him. As to the general Part of it, we find he had a Knowledge of the <HI>Earth</HI>'s being surrounded with

Then he tells us that the <HI>Bear,</HI> or <HI>Stars</HI> of the <HI>Arctick Circle,</HI> never disappear; as an Observation which agrees with no other. And if to this we add (what <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> thought he meant) that the five Plates which were fastened on the Shield, divided it by the Lines where they met, into the five <HI>Zones,</HI> it will ap∣pear an original design of <HI>Globes</HI> and <HI>Spheres.</HI> In the parti∣cular Parts of <HI>Geography,</HI> his Knowledge is intirely inconte∣stable. <HI>Strabo</HI> refers to him upon all occasions, allowing that he knew the Extreams of the Earth, some of which he names and others describes by Signs, as the <HI>Fortunate Islands.</HI> The same <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Strabo, <HI>l.</HI> 1.</NOTE>Author takes notice of his Accounts concerning the several Soils, Plants, Animals, and Customs; as <HI>Aegypt</HI>'s be∣ing fertile of medicinal Herbs, <HI>Lybia</HI>'s Fruitfulness, where the Sheep have Horns, and yean thrice a Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are Knowledges that make <HI>Geography</HI> more various and profita∣ble.

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Contention of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Agamemnon.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the War of <HI>Troy,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> having sack'd some of the neighbouring Towns, and taken from thence two beautiful Captives, <HI>Chruseis</HI> and <HI>Briseis,</HI> allotted the first to <HI>Aga∣gamemnon,</HI> and the last to <HI>Achilles. Chryses,</HI> the Father of <HI>Chruseis</HI> and Priest of <HI>Apollo,</HI> comes to the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp to ransome her; with which the Action of the Poem opens, in the Tenth Year of the Siege. The Priest being refus'd and insolently dismiss'd by <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> intreats for Vengeance from his God, who inflicts a Pestilence on the <HI>Greeks. Achilles</HI> calls a Coun∣cil, and encourages <HI>Chalcas</HI> to declare the Cause of it, who at∣tributes it to the Refusal of <HI>Chruseis.</HI> The King being obliged to send back his Captive, enters into a furious Contest with <HI>Achilles,</HI> which <HI>Nestor</HI> pacifies; however as he had the abso∣lute Command of the Army, he seizes on <HI>Briseis</HI> in revenge. <HI>Achilles</HI> in discontent withdraws himself and his Forces from the rest of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and complaining to <HI>Thetis,</HI> she supplicates <HI>Jupiter</HI> to render them sensible of the Wrong done to her Son, by giving Victory to the <HI>Trojans. Jupiter</HI> granting her Suit incenses <HI>Juno,</HI> between whom the Debate runs high, 'till they are reconciled by the Address of <HI>Vulcan.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Time</HI> of two and twenty Days is taken up in this Book; nine during the Plague, one in the Council and Quarrel of the Princes, and twelve for <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Stay with the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> at whose Return <HI>Thetis</HI> prefers her Petition. The Scene lies in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Camp, then changes to <HI>Chrysa,</HI> and lastly to the Gods on <HI>Olympus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE First Book.</HEAD>
<HEAD><PB REF="141"/>OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is something strange that of all the Commentators upon <HI>Homer,</HI> there is hardly one whose principal De∣sign is to illustrate the Poetical Beauties of the Author. They are voluminous in explaining those Sciences which he made but subservient to his Poetry, and sparing only upon that Art which constitutes his Character. This has been occasion'd by the Ostentation of Men who had more Reading than Taste, and were fonder of shew∣ing their Variety of Learning in all Kinds, than their single Understanding in Poetry. Hence it comes to pass that their Remarks are rather Philosophical, Historical, Geo∣graphical, Allegorical, or in short rather any thing than Critical and Poetical. Even the Grammarians, tho' their whole Business and Use be only to render the Words of an Author intelligible, are strangely touch'd with the Pride of doing something more than they ought. The grand Am∣bition of one sort of Scholars is to encrease the Number of <HI>Various Lections;</HI> which they have done to such a degree of obscure Diligence, that we now begin to value the first Edi∣tions of Books as most correct, because they have been least corrected. The prevailing Passion of others is to discover <HI>New Meanings</HI> in an Author, whom they will cause to appear mysterious purely for the Vanity of being thought to unra∣vel him. These account it a disgrace to be of the Opinion of those that preceded them; and it is generally the Fate of
<PB N="4" REF="142"/>
such People who will never say what was said before, to say what will never be said after them. If they can but find a Word that has once been strain'd by some dark Writer to signify any thing different from its usual Acceptation, it is frequent with them to apply to constantly to that uncommon Meaning, whenever they meet it in a clear Writer: For Reading is so much dearer to them than Sense, that they will discard it at any time to make way for a Criticism. In other Places where they cannot contest the Truth of the common Interpretation, they get themselves room for Dissertation by imaginary <HI>Amphibologies,</HI> which they will have to be design'd by the Author. This Disposition of finding out different Significations in one thing, may be the Effect of either too much, or too little Wit: For Men of a right Understanding generally see at once all that an Author can reasonably mean, but others are apt to fancy Two Meanings for want of know∣ing One. Not to add, that there is a vast deal of diffe∣rence between the Learning of a Critick, and the Puzzling of a Grammarian.</P>
<P>It is no easy Task to make something out of a hundred Pedants that is not Pedantical; yet this he must do, who would give a tolerable Abstract of the former Expositors of <HI>Homer.</HI> The Commentaries of <HI>Eustathius</HI> are indeed an im∣mense Treasury of the <HI>Greek</HI> Learning; but as he seems to have amassed the Substance of whatever others had written upon the Author, so he is not free from some of the fore∣going Censures. There are those who have said, that a judicious Abstract of Him alone might furnish out sufficient Illustrations upon <HI>Homer.</HI> It was resolv'd to take the trouble of reading thro' that voluminous Work, and the Reader may be assur'd, those Remarks that any way concern the Poetry or Art of the Poet, are much fewer than is imagin'd. The greater Part of these is already plunder'd by succeeding Commentators, who have very little but what they owe to him: and I am oblig'd to say even of Madam <HI>Dacier,</HI> that she is either more beholden to him than she has confessed, or has read him less than she is willing to own. She has made a farther Attempt than her Predecessors to discover the Beauties of the Poet; tho' we have often only
<PB N="5" REF="143"/>
her general Praises and Exclamations instead of Reasons. But her Remarks all together are the most judicious Collection ex∣tant of the scatter'd Observations of the Ancients and Mo∣derns, as her Preface is excellent, and her Translation equally careful and elegant.</P>
<P>The chief Design of the following Notes is to comment upon <HI>Homer</HI> as a Poet; whatever in them is extracted from others is constantly own'd; the Remarks of the Ancients are generally set at length, and the Places cited: all those of <HI>Eustathius</HI> are collected which fall under this Scheme: many which were not acknowledg'd by other Commentators, are restor'd to the true Owner; and the same Justice is shown to those who refus'd it to others.</P>

<P>THE Plan of this Poem is form'd upon Anger and its ill Effects, the Plan of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s upon pious Resignation and its Rewards: and thus every Passion or Virtue may be the Foundation of the Scheme of an Epic Poem. This Di∣stinction between two Authors who have been so successful, seem'd necessary to be taken notice of, that they who would imitate either may not stumble at the very Entrance, or curb their Imaginations so as to deprive us of noble Morals told in a new Variety of Accidents. Imitation does not hinder In∣vention: We may observe the Rules of Nature, and write in the Spirit of those who have best hit upon them, without taking the same Track, beginning in the same Manner, and following the Main of their Story almost step by step; as most of the modern Writers of Epic Poetry have done after one of these great Poets.</P>

<P>VERSE 1.] <HI>Quintilian</HI> has told us, that from the begin∣ning of <HI>Homer</HI>'s two Poems the Rules of all <HI>Exordiums</HI> were deriv'd. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>In paucissimis versibus utriusque operis ingressu, legem Prooemiorum non dico servavit, sed constituit.</HI>"</Q> Yet <HI>Rapin</HI> has been very free with this Invocation, in his <HI>Com∣parison</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="144"/>
<HI>between</HI> Homer <HI>and</HI> Virgil; which is by no means the most judicious of his Works. He cavils first at the Poet's in∣sisting so much upon the Effects of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Anger, That it was <Q REND="inline">"the Cause of the Woes of the <HI>Greeks,</HI>"</Q> that it <Q REND="inline">"sent so many Heroes to the Shades,"</Q> that <Q REND="inline">"their Bodies were left a Prey to Birds and Beasts,"</Q> the first of which he thinks had been sufficient. One may answer, that the Woes of <HI>Greece</HI> might consist in several other things than in the Death of her He∣roes, which was therefore needful to be specify'd: As to the Bodies, he might have reflected how great a Curse the want of Burial was accounted by the Ancients, and how prejudicial it was esteem'd even to the Souls of the deceas'd: We have a most particular Example of the Strength of this Opinion from the Conduct of <HI>Sophocles</HI> in his <HI>Ajax;</HI> who thought this very Point sufficient to make the Distress of the last Act of that Tragedy after the Death of his Heroe, purely to sa∣tisfy the Audience that he obtain'd the Rites of Sepulture. Next he objects it as preposterous in <HI>Homer</HI> to desire the Muse to tell him the whole Story, and at the same time to inform her solemnly in his own Person that 'twas the <HI>Will of Jove</HI> which brought it about. But is a Poet then to be ima∣gin'd intirely ignorant of his Subject, tho' he invokes the Muse to relate the Particulars? May not <HI>Homer</HI> be allow'd the Knowledge of so plain a Truth, as that the Will of God is fulfill'd in all things? Nor does his Manner of saying this infer that he <HI>informs</HI> the Muse of it, but only corresponds with the usual way of desiring Information from another concerning any thing, and at the same time mentioning that little we know of it in general. What is there more in this Passage? <Q REND="inline">"Sing, O Goddess, that Wrath of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which prov'd so pernicious to the <HI>Greeks:</HI> We only know the Ef∣fects of it, that it sent innumerable brave Men to the Shades, and that it was <HI>Jove</HI>'s Will it should be so. But tell me, O Muse, what was the Source of this destructive Anger?"</Q> I can't apprehend what <HI>Rapin</HI> means by saying, it is hard to know where this <HI>Invocation</HI> ends, and that it is confounded with the <HI>Narration,</HI> which so manifestly begins at <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. But upon the whole, methinks the <HI>French</HI> Criticks play double with us, when they sometimes
<PB N="7" REF="145"/>
represent the Rules of Poetry to be form'd upon the Practice of <HI>Homer,</HI> and at other times arraign their Master as if he transgress'd them. <HI>Horace</HI> has said the <HI>Exordium</HI> of an Epic Poem ought to be plain and modest, and instances <HI>Homer</HI>'s as such; and <HI>Rapin</HI> from this very Rule will be trying <HI>Homer</HI> and judging it otherwise (for he criticises also upon the beginning of the <HI>Odysses</HI>) But for a full Answer we may bring the Words of <HI>Quintilian</HI> (whom <HI>Rapin</HI> himself allows to be the best of Criticks) concerning these Propositions and Invoca∣tions of our Author. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Benevolum Auditorem invocatione dearum quas praesidere vatibus creditum est, intentum pro∣positâ rerum magnitudine, &amp; docilem summā celeriter com∣prehensâ, facit.</HI>"</Q></P>

But perhaps we may find no occasion to suppose this a Neglect in him, if we consider that the word <HI>Pelides,</HI> had he made use of it without so many Alterations as he has put it to in <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, would still have been true to the Rules of Measure. Make but a Diphthong of the second <HI>Eta</HI> and the <HI>Iota,</HI> instead of their being two Syllables (per∣haps by the fault of Transcribers) and the Objection is gone. Or perhaps it might be design'd that the Verse in which he professes to sing of violent Anger should run off in the Ra∣pidity of Dactyles.

imagining it consistent with the Goodness of the supreme Be∣ing, or <HI>Jupiter,</HI> to contrive or practise any Evil against Men. <HI>Eustathius</HI> makes [<HI>Will</HI>] here to refer to the Promise which <HI>Jupiter</HI> gave to <HI>Thetis,</HI> that he would honour her Son by siding with <HI>Troy</HI> while he should be absent. But to reconcile these two Opinions, perhaps the Meaning may be that when <HI>Fate</HI> had decreed the Destruction of <HI>Troy, Jupiter</HI> having the Power of Incidents to bring it to pass, fulfill'd that Decree by providing Means for it. So that the Words may thus specify the Time of Action, from the beginning of the Poem, in which those Incidents work'd, 'till the Promise to <HI>Thetis</HI> was fulfil'd, and the Destruction of <HI>Troy</HI> ascertain'd to the <HI>Greeks</HI> by the Death of <HI>Hector.</HI> However it is certain that this Poet was not an absolute <HI>Fatalist,</HI> but still suppos'd the Power of <HI>Jove</HI> superior: For in the sixteenth <HI>Iliad</HI> we see him designing to save <HI>Sarpedon</HI> tho' the Fates had decreed his Death, if <HI>Juno</HI> had not interposed.

might shock him in several Particulars following. We should know that the Poet has rather study'd Nature than Per∣fection in the laying down his Characters. He resolv'd to sing the Consequences of Anger; he consider'd what Vir∣tues and Vices would conduce most to bring his Moral out of the Fable; and artfully dispos'd them in his chief Persons after the manner in which we generally find them; making the Fault which most peculiarly attends any good Quality, to reside with it. Thus he has plac'd Pride with Magnanimity in <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> and Craft with Prudence in <HI>Ulysses.</HI> And thus we must take his <HI>Achilles,</HI> not as a meer heroick dispas∣sion'd Character, but as one compounded of Courage and Anger; one who finds himself almost invincible, and as∣sumes an uncontroul'd Carriage upon the Self-consciousness of his Worth; whose high Strain of Honour will not suffer him to betray his Friends or fight against them, even when he thinks they have affronted him; but whose inexorable Re∣sentment will not let him hearken to any Terms of Accom∣modation. These are the Lights and Shades of his Cha∣racter, which <HI>Homer</HI> has heighten'd and darkned in Extreams; because on the one side Valour is the darling Quality of Epic Poetry, and on the other, Anger the particular Subject of his Poem.

The Substance of the whole Passage in <HI>Eustathius</HI> is, that if we consider the Sceptre simply as Wood, <HI>Achilles</HI> after the manner of the Ancients takes in his Transport the first thing to swear by; but that <HI>Homer</HI> himself has in the Process of the Description assign'd Reasons why it is proper for the Occasion, which may be seen by considering it Symbolically. First, That as the Wood being cut from the Tree will never re-unite and flourish, so neither should their Amity ever flourish again, after they were divided by this Contention. Secondly, That a Sceptre being the mark of Power and Symbol of Justice, to swear by it might in effect be construed swearing by the God of Power, and by Justice itself; and accordingly it is spoken of by <HI>Aristotle,</HI> 3 <HI>l.

<P>I cannot leave this Passage without showing in Opposition to some Moderns who have criticiz'd upon it as tedious, that it has been esteem'd a Beauty of so fine a Nature by the An∣cients as to engage them in its Imitation. <HI>Virgil</HI> has almost transcrib'd it in his 12 <HI>Aen.</HI> for the Sceptre of <HI>Latinus.</HI>

He begins with a soft affectionate Complaint which he opposes to their Threats and haughty Language; he reconciles their Attention in an awful manner, by putting them in mind that they hear one whom their Fathers and the greatest Heroes have heard with deference. He sides with neither, that he might not anger any one, while he advises them to the proper Methods of Reconciliation; and he appears to side with both while he praises each, that they may be induc'd by the Recollection of one another's Worth to return to that Amity which would bring Success to the Cause.

with the Plan of the Poem that this should entirely appease them, for then the Anger would be at an end which was pro∣pos'd to be sung through the whole. <HI>Homer</HI> has not therefore made this Speech to have its full Success; and yet that the Eloquence of his <HI>Nestor</HI> might not be thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable, he takes care that the Violence with which the Dispute was manag'd should abate immediately upon his speaking; <HI>Agamemnon</HI> confesses that all he spoke was right, <HI>Achilles</HI> promises not to fight for <HI>Briseis</HI> if she should be sent for, and the Council dissolves.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 698. <HI>Say, artful Manager.</HI>]</Q> The Gods and God∣desses being describ'd with all the Desires and Pleasures, the Passions and Humours of Mankind, the Commentators have taken a Licence from thence to draw not only moral Obser∣vations, but also satyrical Reflections out of this part of the Poet. These I am sorry to see fall so hard upon Womankind, and all by <HI>Juno</HI>'s means. Sometimes she procures them a Lesson for their Curiosity and Unquietness, and at other times for their loud and vexatious Tempers. <HI>Juno</HI> deserves them on the one hand, <HI>Jupiter</HI> thunders them out on the other, and the learned Gentlemen are very particular in enlarging with Remarks on both sides. In her first Speech they make the Poet describe the inquisitive Temper of Womankind in gene∣ral, and their Restlesness if they are not admitted into every Secret. In his Answer to this, they trace those Methods of grave Remonstrance by which it is proper for Husbands to calm them. In her Reply, they find it is the Nature of Wo∣men to be more obstinate for being yielded to: and in his second Return to her, they see the last Method to be used with them upon failure of the first, which is the Exercise of Sovereign Authority.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has translated all this with the utmost Severity upon the Ladies, and spirited the whole with satyrical Addi∣tions of his own. But Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> (who has elsewhere animadverted upon the good Bishop of <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> for his sage Admonitions against the Fair Sex) has not taken the least notice of this general Defection from Complaisance in all the Commentators. She seems willing to give the whole Passage a more important Turn, and incline us to think that <HI>Homer</HI> design'd to represent the Folly and Danger of prying into the Secrets of Providence. 'Tis thrown into that Air in this Translation, not only as it is more noble and instructive in general, but as it is more respectful to the Ladies in par∣ticular; nor should we (any more than Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>) have mention'd what those old Fellows have said, but to desire their Protection against some modern Criticks their Disciples, who may arraign this Proceeding.</P>

<P>JUPITER in pursuance of the Request of <HI>Thetis,</HI> sends a deceitful Vision to <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> persuading him to lead the Army to Battel; in order to make the <HI>Greeks</HI> sensible of their want of <HI>Achilles.</HI> The General, who is de∣luded with the hopes of taking <HI>Troy</HI> without his Assistance, but fears the Army was discourag'd by his Absence and the late Plague, as well as by length of Time, contrives to make trial of their Disposition by a Stratagem. He first communicates his Design to the Princes in Council, that he would propose a Re∣turn to the Soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the Proposal was embrac'd. Then he assembles the whole Host, and upon moving for a Return to <HI>Greece,</HI> they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the Ships. They are detain'd by the Management of <HI>Ulysses,</HI> who chastises the Insolence of <HI>Thersites.</HI> The Assembly is recall'd, several Speeches made on the occasion, and at length the Advice of <HI>Nestor</HI> follow'd, which was to make a general Muster of the Troops, and to divide them into their several Nations, before they proceeded to Battel. This gives occasion to the Poet to ennumerate all the Forces of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans,</HI> in a large Catalogue.</P>

It takes the Figure of the Person who was dearest to <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> as whatever we think of most when awake, is the common Object of our Dreams.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 33. <HI>Draw forth th' embattel'd Train,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> The Dream here repeats the Message of <HI>Jupiter</HI> in the same Terms that he receiv'd it. It is no less than the Father of Gods and Men who gives the Order, and to alter a word were Pre∣sumption. <HI>Homer</HI> constantly makes his Envoys observe this Practice as a Mark of Decency and respect. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> and others have applauded this in general, and ask'd by what Authority an Embassador could alter the Terms of his Commission, since he is not greater or wiser than the Person who gave the Charge? But this is not always the Case in our Author, who not only makes use of this Conduct with respect to the Orders of a higher Power, but in regard to Equals also; as when one Goddess desires another to repre∣sent such an Affair, and she immediately takes the Words from her Mouth and repeats them, of which we have an In∣stance in this Book. Some Objection too may be rais'd to this manner, when Commissions are given in the utmost haste (in a Battel or the like) upon sudden Emergencies; where it seems not very natural to suppose a Man has time to get so many Words by heart as he is made to repeat exactly. In the present Instance, the Repetition is certainly grace∣ful, tho' <HI>Zenodotus</HI> thought it not so the third time, when <HI>Agamemnon</HI> tells his Dream to the Council. I do not pretend to decide upon the Point: For tho' the Reverence of the Repetition seem'd less needful in that Place than when it was deliver'd immediately from <HI>Jupiter;</HI> yet (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes) it was necessary for the Assembly to know the Cir∣cumstances of this Dream, that the Truth of the Relation might be unsuspected.</P>

<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. He says, <Q REND="inline">"This Prince had nothing so much at Heart as to draw the <HI>Greeks</HI> to a Battel, yet knew not how to proceed without <HI>Achilles,</HI> who had just retir'd from the Army; and was apprehensive that the <HI>Greeks</HI> who were displeas'd at the Departure of <HI>Achilles,</HI> might re∣fuse Obedience to his Orders, should he absolutely com∣mand it. In this Circumstance he proposes to the Princes in Council to make a Tryal of arming the <HI>Graecians,</HI> and offers an Expedient himself; which was that he should sound their Dispositions by exhorting him to set sail for <HI>Greece,</HI> but that then the other Princes should be ready to dissuade and detain them. If any object to this Stratagem that <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s whole Scheme would be ruin'd if the Army should take him at his word (which was very pro∣bable) it is to be answer'd, that his Design lay deeper than they imagine, nor did he depend upon his Speech only for detaining them. He had some Cause to fear the <HI>Greeks</HI> had a Pique against him which they had conceal'd, and whatever it was, he judg'd it absolutely necessary to know it before he proceeded to a Battel. He therefore furnishes them with an Occasion to manifest it, and at the same time provides against any ill Effects it might have by his secret Orders to the Princes. It succeeds accordingly, and when the Troops are running to embark, they are stop'd by <HI>Ulysses</HI> and <HI>Nestor.</HI>"</Q>—One may farther observe that this whole Stratagem is concerted in <HI>Nestor</HI>'s Ship, as one whose Wisdom and Secrecy was most confided in. The Story of the Vision's appearing in his Shape, could not but engage him in some degree: It look'd as if <HI>Jupiter</HI> himself added Weight to his Counsels by making use of that venerable Ap∣pearance, and knew this to be the most powerful Method of recommending them to <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> It was therefore but natural for <HI>Nestor</HI> to second the Motion of the King, and by the help of his Authority it prevail'd on the other Princes.</P>

Occasions of Danger, and is what <HI>Homer</HI> has afforded a most powerful Example of in the Oration of <HI>Agamemnon.</HI> 'Tis a Method perfectly wonderful, and even carries in it an Appearance of Absurdity; for all that we generally esteem the Faults of Oratory, by this means become the Virtues of it. Nothing is look'd upon as a greater Error in a Rhetorician than to alledge such Arguments as either are easily answer'd, or may be retorted upon himself, the former is a weak Part, the latter a dangerous one; and <HI>Aga∣memnon</HI> here designedly deals in both. For it is plain that if a Man must not use weak Arguments, or such as may make against him, when he intends to persuade the Thing he says; then on the other side, when he does not intend it; he must observe the contrary Proceeding, and make what are the Faults of Oratory in general, the Excellencies of that Oration in particular, or otherwise he will contra∣dict his own Intention and perssuade the contrary to what he means. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> begins with an Argument easily answer'd, by telling them that <HI>Jupiter had promis'd to crown their Arms with Victory.</HI> For if <HI>Jupiter</HI> had pro∣mis'd this, it was a reason for the Stay in the Camp. <HI>But now</HI> (says he) <HI>Jove has deceiv'd us, and we must return with Ignominy.</HI> This is another of the same kind, for it shews what a Disgrace it is to return. What follows is of the second sort and may be turn'd against him. <HI>Jove will have it so:</HI> For which they have only <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Word, but <HI>Jove</HI>'s own Promise for the contrary. <HI>That God has overthrown many Cities, and will yet overturn many others.</HI> This was a strong Reafon to stay, and put their Confidence in him. <HI>It is shameful to have it told to all Posterity that so many thousand</HI> Greeks, <HI>after a War of so long Continuance, at last return'd home baffled and unsuccessful.</HI> All this might have been said by a pro∣fest Adversary to the Cause he pleads, and indeed is the same thing <HI>Ulysses</HI> says elsewhere in Reproach of their Flight. The Conclusion evidently shews the Intent of the Speaker. <HI>Haste then, let us fly;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the Word which of all others was most likely to prevail upon them to stay; the most open Term of Disgrace he could

<P>The same Author farther observes, <Q REND="inline">"That this whole Oration has the Air of being spoken in a Passion. It be∣gins with a Stroke of the greatest Rashness and Impatience.

When the Stratagem of pretending to set sail, had met with too ready a Con∣sent from the People, his Eloquence appears in all the Forms of Art. In his first Speech he had persuaded the Captains with Mildness, telling them the People's Glory de∣pended upon them, and readily giving a Turn to the first Design, which had like to have been so dangerous, by repre∣senting it only as a Project of <HI>Agamemnon</HI> to discover the cowardly.

with Bravery, and made them know what Part they sustain'd in the War. In his third, he had rebuk'd the Seditious in the Person of <HI>Thersites,</HI> by Reproofs, Threats, and actual Chastisements. And now in this fourth, when all are ga∣ther'd he applies to them in Topics which equally affect them all: He raises their Hearts by putting them in mind of the Promises of Heaven, and those Prophecies of which as they had seen the Truth in the nine Years Delay, they might now expect the Accomplishment in the tenth Year's Success: which is a full Answer to what <HI>Agamemnon</HI> had said of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s deceiving them.</P>

on by <HI>Agamemnon</HI> as soon as <HI>Nestor</HI> undertook that Cause.

For the first, its imme∣diate Effect was to take the whole Army out of its Tumult, break whatever Cabals they might have form'd together by separating them into a new Division, and cause every single Mutineer to come instantly under the View of his own pro∣per Officer for Correction. For the second, it was to be thought the Army would be much strengthen'd by this Uni∣on: Those of different Nations who had different Aims, In∣terests and Friendships, could not assist each other with so much Zeal or so well concur to the same End, as when Friends aided Friends, Kinsmen their Kinsmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when each Commander had the Glory of his own Nation in view, and a greater Emulation was excited between Body and Body; as not only warring for the Honour of <HI>Greece</HI> in general, but for that of every distinct <HI>State</HI> in particular.</P>

And in this one of the principal Beauties of Poetry consists. <HI>Ho∣mer,</HI> on the sight of the March of this numerous Army, gives us five Similes in a Breath, but all entirely different. The first regards the Splendor of their Armour, As a Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The second the various Movements of so many thousands be∣fore they can range themselves in Battel-Array, Like the Swans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The third respects their Number, As the Leaves or Flowers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The fourth the Ardour with which they run to the Combate, Like the Legions of Insects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the fifth the Obedience and exact Discipline of the Troops, ran∣ged without Confusion under their Leaders, As Flocks under their Shepherds.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS on the CATALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>IF we look upon this Piece with an Eye to ancient Learn∣ing, it may be observ'd that however fabulous the other Parts of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Poem may be according to the Nature of Epic Poetry, this Account of the People, Princes, and Coun∣tries is purely Historical, founded on the real Transactions of those Times, and by far the most valuable Piece of Histo∣ry and Geography left us concerning the State of <HI>Greece</HI> in that early Period. <HI>Greece</HI> was then divided into several Dy∣nasties, which our Author has enumerated under their re∣spective Princes; and his Division was look'd upon so exact, that we are told of many Controversies concerning the Boun∣daries of <HI>Graecian</HI> Cities which have been decided upon the Authority of this Piece. <HI>Eustathius</HI> has collected together the following Instances. The City of <HI>Calydon</HI> was adjudg'd to the <HI>Aetolians</HI> notwithstanding the Pretensions of <HI>Aeolia,</HI> because <HI>Homer</HI> had rank'd it among the Towns belonging to the former. <HI>Sestos</HI> was given to those of <HI>Abydos,</HI> upon the Plea that he had said, the <HI>Abydonians</HI> were Possessors of <HI>Sestos, Abydos,</HI> and <HI>Arisbe.</HI> When the <HI>Milesians</HI> and People of <HI>Priene</HI> disputed their Claim to <HI>Mycale,</HI> a Verse of <HI>Homer</HI>

carry'd it in favour of the <HI>Milesians.</HI> And the <HI>Athenians</HI> were put in Possession of <HI>Salamis</HI> by another which was cited by <HI>Solon,</HI> or (as some think) interpolated by him for that Purpose. Nay in so high Estimation has this Catalogue been held, that (as <HI>Porphyry</HI> has written) there have been Laws in some Nations for the Youth to learn it by heart, and par∣ticularly <HI>Cerdias</HI> (whom <HI>Cuperus de Apoth. Homer.</HI> takes to be <HI>Cercydas</HI> a Law-giver of the <HI>Megalopolitans</HI>) made it one to his Countrymen.</P>
<P>But if we consider the Catalogue purely as poetical, it will not want its Beauties in that Light. <HI>Rapin</HI> who was none of the most superstitious Admirers of our Author, reckons it among those Parts which had particularly charm'd him. We may observe first, what an Air of Probability is spread over the whole Poem by the particularizing of every Nation and People concern'd in this War. Secondly, what an entertain∣ing Scene he presents to us, of so many Countries drawn in their liveliest and most natural Colours, while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful Variety of Towns, Ha∣vens, Forests, Vineyards, Groves, Mountains, and Rivers, and are perpetually amus'd with his Observations on the dif∣ferent Soils, Products, Situations, or Prospects. Thirdly, what a noble Review he passes before us of so mighty an Ar∣my, drawn out in order Troop by Troop; which had the Number only been told in the Gross, had never fill'd the Reader with so great a Notion of the Importance of the Action. Fourthly, the Description of the differing Arms and manner of fighting of the Soldiers, and the various Attitudes he had given to the Commanders: Of these Leaders, the greatest Part are either the immediate Sons of Gods, or the Descendants of Gods; and how great an Idea must we have of a War, to the waging of which so many Demi-Gods and Heroes are assembled? Fifthly, the several artful Compli∣ments he paid by this means to his own Country in general, and many of his Contemporaries in particular, by a Celebra∣tion of the Genealogies, ancient Seats, and Dominions of the great Men of his Time. Sixthly, the agreeable Mixture of Narrations from Passages of History or Fables, with which he amuses and relieves us at proper Intervals. And lastly, the
<PB N="30" REF="256"/>
admirable Judgment wherewith he introduces this whole Ca∣talogue, just at a Time when the Posture of Affairs in the Army render'd such a Review of absolute Necessity to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and in a Pause of Action, while each was refreshing himself to prepare for the ensuing Battels.</P>
<P><HI>Macrobius</HI> in his <HI>Saturnalia, lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 15. has given us a judicious Piece of Criticism, in the Comparison betwixt the Catalogues of <HI>Homer</HI> and of <HI>Virgil,</HI> in which he justly allows the Preference to our Author for the following Reasons. <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> (says he) has begun his Description from the most no∣ted Promontory of <HI>Greece</HI> (he means that of <HI>Aulis,</HI> where was the narrowest Passage to <HI>Euboea.</HI>) From thence with a regular Progress he describes either the maritime or mediter∣ranean Towns as their Situations are contiguous; he never pas∣ses with sudden Leaps from Place to Place, omitting those which lie between; but proceeding like a Traveller in the way he has begun, constantly returns to the Place from whence he digress'd, 'till he finishes the whole Circle he design'd. <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> on the contrary has observ'd no Order in the Regions de∣scrib'd in his Catalogue, <HI>l.</HI> 10. but is perpetually breaking from the Course of the Country in a loose and desultory manner. You have <HI>Clusium</HI> and <HI>Cosae</HI> at the beginning, next <HI>Populonia</HI> and <HI>Ilva,</HI> then <HI>Pisae,</HI> which lie at a vast distance in <HI>Etruria;</HI> and immediately after <HI>Cerete, Pyrgi,</HI> and <HI>Graviscae,</HI> Places adjacent to <HI>Rome:</HI> From hence he is snatch'd to <HI>Li∣guria,</HI> then to <HI>Mantua.</HI> The same Negligence is observable in his Enumeration of the Aids that follow'd <HI>Turnus</HI> in <HI>l.</HI> 7. <HI>Macrobius</HI> next remarks, that whatever Persons are nam'd by <HI>Homer</HI> in his Catalogue, are afterwards introduc'd in his Bat∣tels, and whenever any others are kill'd, he mentions only a Multitude in general. Whereas <HI>Virgil</HI> (he continues) has spar'd himself the Labour of that Exactness; For not only several whom he mentions in the List are never heard of in the War, but others make a Figure in the War of whom we had no notice in the List.

King should serve under <HI>Massicus.</HI> Nor indeed does either <HI>Massicus</HI> or <HI>Osinius</HI> ever make their Appearance in the Bat∣tels—He proceeds to instance several others, who tho' cele∣brated for Heroes in the Catalogue, have no farther notice taken of them throughout the Poem. In the third Place he animadverts upon the Confusion of the same Names in <HI>Virgil:</HI> As where <HI>Corinaeus</HI> in the ninth Book is kill'd by <HI>Asylas,</HI> ℣. 571. and <HI>Corinaeus</HI> in the twelfth kills <HI>Ebusus,</HI> ℣. 298. <HI>Numa</HI> is slain by <HI>Nisus, l.</HI> 9. ℣. 554. and <HI>Aeneas</HI> is after∣wards in pursuit of <HI>Numa, l.</HI> 10. ℣. 562. <HI>Aeneas</HI> kills <HI>Camertes</HI> in the tenth Book, ℣. 562. and <HI>Juturna</HI> assumes his Shape in the twelfth, ℣. 224. He observes the same Obscurity in his <HI>Patronymics.</HI> There is <HI>Palinurus Iasides,</HI> and <HI>Iapix Ia∣sides, Hippocoon Hyrtacides,</HI> and <HI>Asylas Hyrtacides.</HI> On the contrary the Caution of <HI>Homer</HI> is remarkable, who having two of the Name of <HI>Ajax</HI> is constantly careful to distinguish them by <HI>Oïleus</HI> or <HI>Telamonius,</HI> the <HI>lesser</HI> or the <HI>greater Ajax.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing to be alledg'd in Defence of <HI>Virgil,</HI> in answer to this Author, but the common Excuse that his <HI>Aeneis</HI> was left unfinish'd. And upon the whole, these are such tri∣vial Slips as great Wits may pass over, and little Criticks re∣joice at.</P>
<P>But <HI>Macrobius</HI> has another Remark which one may accuse of evident Partiality on the side of <HI>Homer.</HI> He blames <HI>Vir∣gil</HI> for having vary'd the Expression in his Catalogue to avoid the Repetition of the same Words, and prefers the bare and unadorn'd Reiterations of <HI>Homer;</HI> who begins almost every Article the same way, and ends perpetually, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Perhaps the best reason to be given for this, had been the artless Manner of the first Times, when such Re∣petitions were not thought ungraceful. This may appear from several of the like Nature in the Scripture; as in the twenty sixth Chapter of <HI>Numbers,</HI> where the Tribes of <HI>Israel</HI> are enumerated in the Plains of <HI>Moab,</HI> and each Division re∣counted in the same Words. So in the seventh Chapter of the <HI>Revelations: Of the Tribe of</HI> Gad <HI>were sealed twelve thousand, &amp;c.</HI> But the Words of <HI>Macrobius</HI> are <HI>Has copias fortasse putat aliquis Divinae illi simplicitati praeferendas. Sed nescio quo modo Ho∣merum</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="258"/>
<HI>repetitio illa unicè decet, &amp; est genio antiqui Poetae digna.</HI> This is exactly in the Spirit, and almost in the Cant of a true modern Critick. The <HI>Simplicitas,</HI> the <HI>Nescio quo modo,</HI> the <HI>Genio antiqui Poetae digna,</HI> are excellent general Phrases for those who have no Reasons. <HI>Simplicity</HI> is our Word of Disguise for a shameful unpoetical Neglect of Ex∣pression: The Term of the <HI>Je ne sçay quoy</HI> is the very Sup∣port of all ignorant Pretenders to Delicacy; and to lift up our Eyes, and talk of the <HI>Genius of an Ancient,</HI> is at once the cheapest way of shewing our own Taste, and the shortest way of criticizing the Wit of others our Contemporaries.</P>
<P>One may add to the foregoing Comparison of these two Authors, some Reasons for the Length of <HI>Homer</HI>'s, and the Shortness of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Catalogues. As, that <HI>Homer</HI> might have a Design to settle the Geography of his Country, there be∣ing no Description of <HI>Greece</HI> before his Days; which was not the Case with <HI>Virgil. Homer</HI>'s Concern was to compliment <HI>Greece</HI> at a time when it was divided into many distinct States, each of which might expect a Place in his Catalogue: But when all <HI>Italy</HI> was swallow'd up in the sole Dominion of <HI>Rome, Virgil</HI> had only <HI>Rome</HI> to celebrate. <HI>Homer</HI> had a numerous Army, and was to describe an important War with great and various Events; whereas <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Sphere was much more con∣fined. The Ships of the <HI>Greeks</HI> are computed at about one thousand two hundred, those of <HI>Aeneas</HI> and his Aids but at two and forty; and as the Time of the Action of both Poems is the same, we may suppose the Built of their Ships, and the Number of Men they contain'd, to be much alike. So that if the Army of <HI>Homer</HI> amounts to about a hundred thou∣sand Men, that of <HI>Virgil</HI> cannot be above four thousand. If any one be farther curious to know upon what this Compu∣tation is founded, he may see it in the following Passage of <HI>Thucidydes, lib.</HI> 1. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Homer</HI>'s Fleet (says he) consisted of one thousand two hundred Vessels: those of the <HI>Boeotians</HI> carry'd one hundred and twenty Men in each, and those of <HI>Philoctetes</HI> fifty. By these I suppose <HI>Homer</HI> exprest the largest and the smallest Size of Ships, and therefore men∣tions no other sort. But he tells us of those who sail'd
<PB N="33" REF="259"/>
with <HI>Philoctetes,</HI> that they serv'd both as Mariners and Sol∣diers, in saying the Rowers were all of them Archers. From hence the whole Number will be seen, if we estimate the Ships at a Medium between the greatest and the least."</Q> That is to say, at eighty five Men to each Vessel (which is the Mean between fifty and a hundred and twenty) the Total comes to a hundred and two thousand Men. <HI>Plutarch</HI> was therefore in a Mistake when he computed the Men at a hundred and twenty thousand, which proceeded from his supposing a hun∣dred and twenty in every Ship; the contrary to which ap∣pears from the above-mention'd Ships of <HI>Philoctetes,</HI> as well as from those of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which are said to carry but fifty Men a-piece, in the sixteenth <HI>Iliad,</HI> ℣. 167.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Imitation of this Catalogue, there has scarce been any Epic Writer but has copy'd after it; which is at least a Proof how beautiful this Part has been ever esteem'd by the finest Genius's in all Ages. The Catalogues in the ancient Poets are generally known, only I must take notice that the <HI>Phocian</HI> and <HI>Boeotian</HI> Towns in the fourth <HI>Thebaid</HI> of <HI>Sta∣tius</HI> are translated from hence. Of the Moderns, those which most excel, owe their Beauty to the Imitation of some single Particular only of <HI>Homer.</HI> Thus the chief Grace of <HI>Tasso</HI>'s Catalogue consists in the Description of the Heroes, without any thing remarkable on the side of the Countries: Of the Pieces of Story he has interwoven, that of <HI>Tancred</HI>'s Amour to <HI>Clo∣rinda</HI> is ill placed, and evidently too long for the rest. <HI>Spen∣cer</HI>'s Enumeration of the <HI>British</HI> and <HI>Irish Rivers</HI> in the ele∣venth Canto of his fourth Book, is one of the noblest in the World; if we consider his Subject was more confined, and can excuse his not observing the Order or Course of the Country; but his Variety of Description, and Fruitfulness of Imagination are no where more admirable than in that Part. <HI>Milton</HI>'s List of the fallen Angels in his first Book is an exact Imitation of <HI>Homer,</HI> as far as regards the Digressions of History and An∣tiquities, and his manner of inserting them: In all else I be∣lieve it must be allow'd inferior. And indeed what <HI>Macro∣bius</HI> has said to cast <HI>Virgil</HI> below <HI>Homer,</HI> will fall much more strongly upon all the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="260"/>
I had some cause to fear that this Catalogue which contri∣buted so much to the Success of the Author, should ruin that of the Translator. A meer heap of proper Names tho' but for a few Lines together, could afford little Entertainment to an <HI>English</HI> Reader, who probably could not be appriz'd ei∣ther of the Necessity or Beauty of this Part of the Poem. There were but two things to be done to give it a chance to please him; to render the Versification very flowing and mu∣sical, and to make the whole appear as much a <HI>Landscape</HI> or <HI>Piece of Painting</HI> as possible. For both of these I had the Example of <HI>Homer</HI> in general; and <HI>Virgil,</HI> who found the Necessity in another Age to give more into Description, seem'd to authorise the latter in particular. <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Ha∣licarnassus</HI> in his Discourse of the <HI>Structure and Disposition of Words,</HI> professes to admire nothing more than that har∣monious Exactness with which <HI>Homer</HI> has placed these Words, and soften'd the Syllables into each other, so as to derive Musick from a Croud of Names which have in them∣selves no Beauty or Dignity. I would flatter my self that I have practis'd this not unsuccessfully in our Language, which is more susceptible of all the Variety and Power of Numbers than any of the modern, and second to none but the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman.</HI> For the latter Point, I have ventured to open the Prospect a little, by the addition of a few Epithets or short Hints of Description to some of the Places mention'd; tho' seldom exceeding the Compass of half a Verse (the Space to which my Author himself generally confines these Pictures in Miniature.) But this has never been done without the best Authorities from the Ancients, which may be seen under the respective Names in the Geographical Table following.</P>
<P>The Table itself I thought but necessary to annex to the Map, as my Warrant for the Situations assign'd in it to seve∣ral of the Towns. For in whatever Maps I have seen to this Purpose, many of the Places are omitted, or else set down at random. <HI>Sophianus</HI> and <HI>Gerbelius</HI> have labour'd to settle the Geography of old <HI>Greece,</HI> many of whose Mistakes were rec∣tify'd by <HI>Laurenbergius.</HI> These however deserv'd a greater Commendation than those who succeeded them; and parti∣cularly
<PB N="35" REF="261"/>
<HI>Sanson</HI>'s Map prefix'd to <HI>Du Pin</HI>'s <HI>Bibliotheque Histo∣rique</HI> is miserably defective both in Omissions and false Pla∣cings; which I am obliged to mention, as it pretends to be design'd expresly for this Catalogue of <HI>Homer.</HI> I am per∣suaded the greater Part of my Readers will have no Curiosity this way, however they may allow me the Endeavour of gra∣tifying those few who have: The rest are at liberty to pass the two or three following Leaves unread.</P>

<P>THE Armies being ready to engage, a single Combate is agreed upon between <HI>Menelaus</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> (by the Intervention of <HI>Hector</HI>) for the Determination of the War. <HI>Iris</HI> is sent to call <HI>Helena</HI> to behold the Fight.

The Kings on ei∣ther Part take the solemn Oath for the Conditions of the Com∣bate. The Duel ensues, wherein <HI>Paris</HI> being overcome is snatch'd away in a Cloud by <HI>Venus,</HI> and transported to his Apartment. She then calls <HI>Helen</HI> from the Walls, and brings the Lovers together. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> on the Part of the <HI>Grae∣cians,</HI> demands the Restoration of <HI>Helen,</HI> and the Performance of the Articles.</P>

<L N="270">My House was honour'd with each Royal Guest:</L>

His Words succinct, yet full, without a Fault;</L>
<L>He spoke no more than just the Thing he ought.</L>

<L N="280">His modest Eyes he fix'd upon the Ground,</L>

<L N="305">My Brothers these; the same our native Shore,</L>
<L>One House contain'd us, as one Mother bore.</L>
<L>Perhaps the Chiefs, from warlike Toils at ease,</L>

<L>May all their Consorts serve promiscuous Lust,</L>

<L>Thus either Host their Imprecations join'd,</L>

<HEAD><PB N="3" REF="298"/>OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the Books of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> there is scarce any more pleasing than the Third. It may be divided into five Parts, each of which has a Beauty different from the other. The first contains what pass'd before the two Armies, and the Proposal of the Combate between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus:</HI> The Attention and Suspense of these mighty Hosts, which were just upon the Point of joining Battel, and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unex∣pected Challenge, have something in them wonderfully pom∣pous and of an amusing Solemnity. The second Part which de∣scribes the Behaviour of <HI>Helena</HI> in this Juncture, her Conference with the old King and his Counsellors, with the Review of the Heroes from the Battelments, is an Episode entirely of another sort, which excels in the Natural and Pathetick. The third consists of the Ceremonies of the Oath on both sides and the Preliminaries to the Combate; with the beau∣tiful Retreat of <HI>Priam,</HI> who in the Tenderness of a Parent withdraws from the sight of the Duel: These Particulars de∣tain the Reader in Expectation, and heighten his Impatience for the Fight itself. The fourth is the Description of the Duel, an exact Piece of Painting where we see every Atti∣tude, Motion, and Action of the Combatants particularly and distinctly, and which concludes with a surprizing Pro∣priety, in the rescue of <HI>Paris</HI> by <HI>Venus.</HI> The Machine of
<PB N="4" REF="299"/>
that Goddess which makes the fifth Part, and whose End is to reconcile <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Helena,</HI> is admirable in every Circum∣stance; The Remonstrance she holds with the Goddess, the Reluctance with which she obeys her, the Reproaches she casts upon <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Flattery and Courtship with which he so soon wins her over to him. <HI>Helen</HI> (the main Cause of this War) was not to be made an odious Character; She is drawn by this great Master with the finest Strokes, as a frail, but not an abandon'd Creature. She has perpetual Struggles of Virtue on the one side, and Softnesses which overcome them on the other. Our Author has been remark∣ably careful to tell us this; whenever he but slightly names her in the foregoing Part of his Work she is represented at the same time as repentant; and it is thus we see her at large at her first Appearance in the present Book, which is one of the shortest of the whole <HI>Iliad,</HI> but in recompence has Beau∣ties almost in every Line, and most of them so obvious that to acknowledge them we need only to read them.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 3. <HI>With Shouts the</HI> Trojans.]</Q> The Book begins with a fine Opposition of the Noise of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army to the Silence of the <HI>Graecians.</HI> It was but natural to imagine this, since the former was compos'd of many different Na∣tions, of various Languages and Strangers to each other; the latter were more united in their Neighbourhood, and under Leaders of the same Country. But as this Observation seems particularly insisted upon by our Author (for he uses it again in the fourth Book, ℣. 430.) so he had a farther Reason for it. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his Treatise of reading the Poets, remarks upon this Distinction, as a particular Credit to the military Discipline of the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And several ancient Authors tell us, it was the Manner of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> to encounter with Shouts and Outcries; as it continues to this Day the Custom of the Eastern Nations. Perhaps these Clamours were only to encourage their Men, instead of martial Instruments. I think Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> says, there never was a People but made use of some sort of Musick in Battel: <HI>Homer</HI> never
<PB N="5" REF="300"/>
mentions any in the <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Trojan</HI> Armies, and it is scarce to be imagined he would omit a Circumstance so poetical without some particular Reason. The Verb <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which the modern <HI>Greeks</HI> have since appropriated to the sound of a Trumpet, is used indifferently in our Author for other Sounds, as for Thunder in the the 21<HI>st Iliad,</HI> ℣. 388. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—. He once names the Trumpet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in a <HI>Simile,</HI> upon which <HI>Eustathius</HI> and <HI>Didymus</HI> observe that the use of it was known in the Poet's Time, but not in that of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. And hence we may infer that <HI>Homer</HI> was particularly careful not to confound the Manners of the Times he wrote of, with those of the Times he liv'd in.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 7. <HI>The Cranes embody'd fly.</HI>]</Q> If Wit has been truly describ'd to be a Similitude in Ideas, and is more excellent as that Similitude is more surprizing; there cannot be a truer kind of Wit than what is shewn in apt Comparisons, espe∣cially when composed of such Subjects as having the least Re∣lation to each other in general, have yet some Particular that agrees exactly. Of this Nature is the Simile of the <HI>Cranes</HI> to the <HI>Trojan</HI> Army, where the Fancy of <HI>Homer</HI> flew to the re∣motest Part of the World for an Image which no Reader could have expected. But it is no less exact than surprizing. The Likeness consists in two Points, the <HI>Noise</HI> and the <HI>Order;</HI> the latter is so observable as to have given some of the An∣cients occasion to imagine the embatteling of an Army was first learn'd from the close manner of Flight of these Birds. But this Part of the Simile not being directly express'd by the Author, has been overlook'd by some of the Commentators. It may be remark'd that <HI>Homer</HI> has generally a wonderful Closeness in all the Particulars of his Comparisons, notwith∣standing he takes a Liberty in his Expression of them. He seems so secure of the main Likeness, that he makes no scru∣ple to play with the Circumstances; sometimes by transposing the Order of them, sometimes by super-adding them, and some∣times (as in this Place) by neglecting them in such a manner as to leave the Reader to supply them himself.

The Picture here given of <HI>Paris</HI>'s Air and Dress, is exactly correspondent to his Character; you see him endeavouring to mix the fine Gentleman with the Warriour; and this Idea of him <HI>Homer</HI> takes care to keep up, by describing him not without the same Regard when he is arming to encounter <HI>Menelaus</HI> afterwards in a close Fight, as he shews here where he is but preluding and flourishing in the Gaiety of his Heart. And when he tells us in that Place that he was in danger of being strangled by the Strap of his Helmet, he takes notice that it was <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>embroider'd.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 37. <HI>So joys a Lion if the branching Deer, Or Moun∣tain Goat.</HI>]</Q> The old Scholiasts refining on this Simile will have it that <HI>Paris</HI> is compar'd to a Goat on account of his Incon∣tinence, and to a Stag for his Cowardice: To this last they make an Addition which is very ludicrous, that he is also liken'd to a Deer for his <HI>Skill in Musick,</HI> and cite <HI>Aristotle</HI> to prove that Animal delights in Harmony, which Opinion is alluded to by Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> in these Lines,

him. It is equally an Injustice to <HI>Paris,</HI> to abuse him for understanding Musick, and to represent his Retreat as purely the Effect of Fear, which proceeded from his Sense of Guilt with respect to the particular Person of <HI>Menelaus.</HI> He appear'd at the Head of the Army to challenge the boldest of the Enemy: Nor is his Character elsewhere in the <HI>Iliad</HI> by any means that of a Coward. <HI>Hector</HI> at the end of the sixth Book confesses, that no Man could justly reproach him as such. Nor is he represented so by <HI>Ovid</HI> (who copy'd <HI>Homer</HI> very closely) in the end of his Epistle to <HI>Helen.</HI> The Moral of <HI>Homer</HI> is much finer: A brave Mind however blinded with Passion is sensible of Remorse as soon as the injur'd Object presents itself; and <HI>Paris</HI> never behaves himself ill in War, but when his Spirits are depress'd by the Consciousness of an Injustice. This also will account for the seeming Incongruity of <HI>Homer</HI> in this Passage, who (as they would have us think) paints him a shameful Coward, at the same time that he is perpetually calling him <HI>the divine Paris,</HI> and <HI>Paris like a God.</HI> What he says immediately afterwards in answer to <HI>Hector</HI>'s Reproof, will make this yet more clear.</P>

<P>But it may be said to the Praise of <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he has ap∣ply'd it upon an Occasion where it has an additional Beauty. <HI>Paris</HI> upon the sight of <HI>Menelaus</HI>'s Approach, is compar'd to a Traveller who sees a Snake shoot on a sudden towards him.

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 53. <HI>As God-like</HI> Hector.]</Q> This is the first Place of the Poem where <HI>Hector</HI> makes a figure, and here it seems proper to give an Idea of his Character, since if he is not the chief Heroe of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> he is at least the most amiable. There are several Reasons which render <HI>Hector</HI> a favorite Character with every Reader, some of which shall here be offer'd. The chief Moral of <HI>Homer</HI> was to expose the ill Ef∣fects of Discord; the <HI>Greeks</HI> were to be shewn disunited, and to render that Disunion the more probable, he has design∣edly given them <HI>mixt</HI> Characters. The <HI>Trojans</HI> on the other hand were to be represented making all Advantages of the others Disagreement, which they could not do without a strict Union among themselves. <HI>Hector</HI> therefore who commanded them, must be endu'd with all such Qualifications as tended to the Preservation of it; as <HI>Achilles</HI> with such as promoted the contrary. The one stands in Contraste to the other, an ac∣complish'd Character of Valour unruffled by Rage and An∣ger, and uniting his People by his Prudence and Example. <HI>Hector</HI> has also a Foil to set him off in his own Family; we are perpetually opposing in our Minds the Incontinence of <HI>Paris,</HI> who exposes his Country, to the Temperance of <HI>Hector</HI> who protects it. And indeed it is this Love of his Country which appears his principal Passion, and the Motive of all his Actions. He has no other Blemish than that he fights in an unjust Cause, which <HI>Homer</HI> has yet been careful to tell us he would not do, if his Opinion were followed. But since he cannot prevail, the Affection he bears to his Parents and Kindred, and his desire of defending them, in∣cites him to do his utmost for their Safety. We may add
<PB N="9" REF="304"/>
that <HI>Homer</HI> having so many <HI>Greeks</HI> to celebrate, makes them shine in their turns, and singly in their several Books, one succeeding in the Absence of another: Whereas <HI>Hector</HI> ap∣pears in every Battel the Life and Soul of his Party, and the constant Bulwark against every Enemy: He stands against <HI>Agamemnon</HI>'s Magnanimity, <HI>Diomed</HI>'s Bravery, <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Strength, and <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Fury. There is besides, an acciden∣tal Cause for our liking him from reading the Writers of the <HI>Augustan</HI> Age, especially <HI>Virgil,</HI> whose Favorite he grew more particularly from the time when the <HI>Caesars</HI> fancy'd to derive their Pedigree from <HI>Troy.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 55. <HI>Unhappy</HI> Paris, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</Q> It may be observ'd in Honour of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Judgment, that the Words which <HI>Hector</HI> is made to speak here, very strongly mark his Cha∣racter. They contain a warm Reproach of Cowardice, and shew him to be touch'd with so high a Sense of Glory, as to think Life insupportable without it. His calling to mind the gallant Figure which <HI>Paris</HI> had made in his Amours to <HI>He∣len,</HI> and opposing to it the Image of his Flight from her Husband, is a Sarcasm of the utmost Bitterness and Vivacity.

That hasty manner of Expression without the Connexion of Particles, is (as <HI>Eustathius</HI> remarks) extreamly natural to a Man in Anger, who thinks he can never vent himself too soon.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 86. <HI>'Tis just, my Brother.</HI>]</Q> This Speech is a far∣ther opening of the true Character of <HI>Paris.</HI> He is a Master of Civility, no less well-bred to his own Sex than courtly to the other. The Reproof of <HI>Hector</HI> was of a severe Nature, yet he receives it as from a Brother and a Friend, with Can∣dour and Modesty. This Answer is remarkable for its fine Address; he gives the Heroe a decent and agreeable Reproof for having too rashly depreciated the Gifts of Nature. He allows the Quality of Courage its utmost due, but desires the same Justice to those softer Accomplishments, which he lets him know are no less the Favour of Heaven. Then he re∣moves from himself the Charge of want of Valour, by pro∣posing the single Combate with the very Man he had just declined to engage; which having shewn him void of any Malevolence to his Rival on the one hand, he now proves himself free from the Imputation of Cowardice on the other. <HI>Homer</HI> draws him (as we have seen) soft of Speech, the na∣tural Quality of an amorous Temper; vainly gay in War as well as Love; with a Spirit that can be surprized and recol∣lected, that can receive Impressions of Shame or Apprehen∣sion on the one side, or of Generosity and Courage on the other; the usual Disposition of easy and courteous Minds which are most subject to the Rule of Fancy and Pas∣sion. Upon the whole, this is no worse than the Picture of a <HI>gentle Knight,</HI> and one might fancy the Heroes of the mo∣dern Romance were form'd upon the Model of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>

He who was so very particular in the most minute Points, can hardly be thought to have been negligent in this. Some Reasons may be offer'd that they both spoke the same Language; for the <HI>Trojans</HI> (as may be seen in <HI>Dion.

<PB N="13" REF="308"/>
the <HI>Laconick;</HI> which the better to comprehend, we may re∣member there are in <HI>Homer</HI> three Speakers of different Cha∣racters, agreeable to the three different kinds of Eloquence. These we may compare with each other in one Instance, sup∣posing them all to use the same Heads, and in the same Order.</P>
<P>The Materials of the Speech are, The manifesting his Grief for the War, with the hopes that it is in his Power to end it; an Acceptance of the propos'd Challenge; an Ac∣count of the Ceremonies to be us'd in the League; and a Proposal of a proper Caution to secure it.</P>
<P>Now had <HI>Nestor</HI> these Materials to work upon, he would pro∣bably have begun with a Relation of all the Troubles of the nine Year's Siege which he hop'd he might now bring to an end; he would court their Benevolence and good Wishes for his Prospe∣rity with all the Figures of Amplification; while he accepted the Challenge, he would have given an Example to prove that the single Combate was a wise, gallant, and gentle way of ending the War, practis'd by their Fathers; in the Descrip∣tion of the Rites he would be exceeding particular; and when he chose to demand the Sanction of <HI>Priam</HI> rather than of his Sons, he would place in Opposition on one side the Son's Action which began the War, and on the other the Im∣pressions of Concern or Repentance which it must by this time have made in the Father's Mind, whose Wisdom he would undoubtedly extol as the effect of his Age. All this he would have expatiated upon with Connexions of the Discourses in the most evident manner, and the most easy, gliding, undiso∣bliging Transitions. The Effect would be, that the People would hear him with Pleasure.</P>
<P>Had it been <HI>Ulysses</HI> who was to make the Speech, he would have mention'd a few of their most affecting Calamities in a pathetick Air; then have undertaken the Fight with testify∣ing such a chearful Joy, as should have won the Hearts of the Soldiers to follow him to the Field without being desired. He would have been exceeding cautious in wording the Con∣ditions; and solemn rather than particular in speaking of the Rites, which he would only insist on as an Opportunity to exhort both sides to a fear of the Gods, and a strict regard
<PB N="14" REF="309"/>
of Justice. He would have remonstrated the use of sending for <HI>Priam;</HI> and (because no Caution could be too much) have demanded his Sons to be bound with him. For a Conclusion he would have us'd some noble Sentiment agreeable to a He∣roe, and (it may be) have enforc'd it with some inspirited Action. In all this you would have known that the Discourse hung together, but its Fire would not always suffer it to be seen in cooler Transitions, which (when they are too nicely laid open) may conduct the Reader, but never carry him away. The People would hear him with Emotion.</P>
<P>These Materials being given to <HI>Menelaus,</HI> he but just mentions their Troubles, and his Satisfaction in the Prospect of ending them, shortens the Proposals, says a Sacrifice is necessary, requires <HI>Priam</HI>'s Presence to confirm the Conditi∣ons, refuses his Sons with a Resentment of that Injury he suffer'd by them, and concludes with a Reason for his Choice from the Praise of Age, with a short Gravity, and the Air of an Apothegm. This he puts in order without any more Transition than what a single Conjunction affords. And the effect of the Discourse is, that the People are instructed by it in what is to be done.</P>

expect, in the Narration of this long War, that a Period might have been put to it by the single danger of the Parties chiefly concern'd, <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Menelaus. Homer</HI> has there∣fore taken care toward the beginning of his Poem to ob∣viate that Objection; and contriv'd such a Method to ren∣der this Combate of no effect, as should naturally make way for all the ensuing Battels, without any future Prospect of a Determination but by the Sword. It is farther worth ob∣serving, in what manner he has improved into Poetry the common History of this Action, if (as one may imagine) it was the same with that we have in the second Book of <HI>Dictys Cretensis. When</HI> Paris (says he) <HI>being wounded by the Spear of</HI> Menelaus <HI>fell to the Ground, just as his Adversary was rush∣ing upon him with his Sword, he was shot by an Arrow from</HI> Pandarus, <HI>which prevented his Revenge in the Moment he was going to take it. Immediately on the sight of this perfidious Action, the</HI> Greeks <HI>rose in a Tumult; the</HI> Trojans <HI>rising at the same time, came on, and rescued</HI> Paris <HI>from his Enemy. Homer</HI> has with great Art and Invention mingled all this with the Marvellous, and rais'd it in the Air of Fable. The <HI>Goddess of Love</HI> rescues her Favourite; <HI>Jupiter</HI> debates whether or no the War shall end by the Defeat of <HI>Paris; Juno</HI> is for the Continuance of it; <HI>Minerva</HI> incites <HI>Pandarus</HI> to break the Truce, who thereupon shoots at <HI>Menelaus.</HI> This heigh∣tens the Grandeur of the Action without destroying the Ve∣risimilitude, diversifies the Poem, and exhibits a fine Moral; that whatever seems in the World the Effect of common Causes, is really owing to the Decree and Disposition of the Gods.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="324"/>
most violent is the moral Expositor <HI>Spondanus,</HI> who will not so much as allow him to say a civil thing to <HI>Helen. Mollis, effoeminatus, &amp; spurcus ille adulter, nihil de libidine suâ immi∣nutum dicit, sed nunc magis eâ corripi quàm unquam aliàs, ne quidem cùm primùm ea ipsi dedit</HI> (<HI>Latini ita rectè exprimunt <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in re venereâ</HI>) <HI>in Insula</HI> Cranaë. <HI>Cùm alioqui ho∣mines primi concubitûs soleant esse ardentiores.</HI> I could not deny the Reader the Diversion of this Remark, nor <HI>Sponda∣uus</HI> the Glory of his Zeal, who was but two and twenty when it was written. Madam <HI>Dacier</HI> is also very severe upon <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> but for a Reason more natural to a Lady. She is of Opinion that the Passion of the Lover would scarce have been so excessive as he here describes it, but for fear of losing his Mistress immediately, as foreseeing the <HI>Greeks</HI> would demand her. One may answer to this lively Remark, that <HI>Paris</HI> having nothing to say for himself, was obliged to testify an uncommon Ardour for his Lady, at a time when Compli∣ments were to pass instead of Reasons. I hope to be excus'd if (in Revenge for her Remark upon our Sex) I observe up∣on the Behaviour of <HI>Helen</HI> throughout this Book, which gives a pretty natural Picture of the Manners of theirs. We see her first in Tears, repentant, cover'd with Confusion at the sight of <HI>Priam,</HI> and secretly inclin'd to return to her former Spouse. The Disgrace of <HI>Paris</HI> increases her Dis∣like of him; she rails, she reproaches, she wishes his Death; and after all, is prevail'd upon by one kind Compliment, and yields to his Embraces. Methinks when this Lady's Ob∣servation and mine are laid together, the best that can be made of them is to conclude, that since both the Sexes have their Frailties, it would be well for each to forgive the other.</P>
<P>It is worth looking backward, to observe the <HI>Allegory</HI> here carry'd on with respect to <HI>Helena,</HI> who lives thro' this whole Book in a Whirl of Passions, and is agitated by turns with Sentiments of Honour and Love. The Goddesses made use of to cast the Appearance of Fable over the Story, are <HI>Iris</HI> and <HI>Venus.</HI> When <HI>Helen</HI> is call'd to the Tower to behold her former Friends, <HI>Iris</HI> the Messenger of <HI>Juno</HI> (the Goddess
<PB N="30" REF="325"/>
of Honour) is sent for her; and when invited to the Bed-Chamber of <HI>Paris, Venus</HI> is to beckon her out of the Com∣pany. The Forms they take to carry on these different Af∣fairs, are properly chosen: the one assuming the Person of the Daughter of <HI>Antenor,</HI> who press'd most for her being re∣stor'd to <HI>Menelaus;</HI> the other the Shape of an old Maid, who was privy to the Intrigue with <HI>Paris</HI> from the begin∣ning. And in the Consequences, as the one inspires the Love of her former Empire, Friends and Country; so the other instills the Dread of being cast off by all if she for∣sook her second Choice, and causes the Return of her Ten∣derness to <HI>Paris.</HI> But if she has a Struggle for <HI>Honour,</HI> she is in a Bondage to <HI>Love;</HI> which gives the Story its Turn that way, and makes <HI>Venus</HI> oftner appear than <HI>Iris.</HI> There is in one Place a Lover to be protected, in another a Love-Quarrel to be made up, in both which the Goddess is kindly officious. She conveys <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Troy</HI> when he had escap'd the Enemy; which may hint his Love for his Mistress, that hurry'd him away to justify himself before her. She softens and terrifies <HI>Helen,</HI> in order to make up the Breach between them: And even when that Affair is finished, we do not find the Poet dismisses her from the Chamber, whatever Privacies the Lovers had a mind to: In which Circumstance he seems to draw aside the Veil of his Allegory, and to let the Reader at last into this Meaning of it, that the Goddess of Love has been all the while nothing more than the Passion of it.</P>

<P>IT was from the beginning of this Book that <HI>Virgil</HI> has taken that of his tenth <HI>Aeneid,</HI> as the whole Tenour of the Story in this and the last Book is followed in his twelfth. The Truce and the solemn Oath, the Breach of it by a Dart thrown by <HI>Tolumnius, Juturna</HI>'s inciting the <HI>La∣tines</HI> to renew the War, the Wound of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> his speedy Cure, and the Battel ensuing, all these are manifestly copied from hence. The Solemnity, Surprize, and Variety of these Circumstances seem'd to him of Importance enough, to build the whole Cata∣strophe of his Work upon them; tho' in <HI>Homer</HI> they are but Openings to the general Action, and such as in their Warmth are still exceeded by all that follows them. They are chosen, we grant, by <HI>Virgil</HI> with great Judgment, and conclude his Poem with a becoming Majesty: Yet the finishing his Scheme with that which is but the coolest Part of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Action, tends in some degree to shew the Disparity of the Poetical Fire in these two Authors.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 18. <HI>Tho' great</HI> Atrides <HI>gain'd the glorious Strife.</HI>]</Q> Ju∣piter here makes it a Question, Whether the foregoing Com∣bate should determine the Controversy, or the Peace be bro∣ken. His putting it thus, <HI>that</HI> Paris <HI>is not killed, but</HI> Mene∣laus <HI>has the Victory,</HI> gives a Hint for a Dispute whether the Conditions of the Treaty were valid or annulled; that is to say, whether the Controversy was to be determined by the <HI>Victory</HI> or by the <HI>Death</HI> of one of the Combatants. Ac∣cordingly it has been disputed whether the Articles were really binding to the <HI>Trojans</HI> or not? <HI>Plutarch</HI> has treated the Question in his <HI>Symposiacks l.</HI> 9. <HI>qu.</HI> 13. The Substance is this. In the first Proposal of the Challenge <HI>Paris</HI> mentions only the Victory, <HI>And who his Rival shall in Arms subdue:</HI> Nor does <HI>Hector</HI> who carries it say any more. However <HI>Me∣nelaus</HI> understands it of the Death, by what he replies: <HI>Fall he that must beneath his Rival's Arms, And live the rest—Iris</HI> to <HI>Helen</HI> speaks only of the former; and <HI>Idaeus</HI> to <HI>Priam</HI> re∣peats the same Words.

<HI>only knows—</HI>(I do not cite the <HI>Greek</HI> because the <HI>English</HI> has preserv'd the same Nicety.) <HI>Paris</HI> himself confesses he has lost the Victory, in his Speech to <HI>Helen,</HI> which he would hardly have done had the whole depended on that alone: And lastly <HI>Menelaus</HI> (after the Conquest is clearly his by the Flight of <HI>Paris</HI>) is still searching round the Field to kill him, as if all were of no effect without the Death of his Adversary. It appears from hence that the <HI>Trojans</HI> had no ill Pretence to break the Treaty, so that <HI>Homer</HI> ought not to have been directly accus'd of making <HI>Jupiter</HI> the Author of Perjury in what follows, which is one of the Chief of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Objections against him.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 96. <HI>Th'Advice approv'd.</HI>]</Q> This is one of the Places for which <HI>Homer</HI> is blamed by <HI>Plato,</HI> who introduces <HI>Socrates</HI> reprehending it in his Dialogue of the Republick.

Unless even then one might imagine, that <HI>Homer</HI>'s Heaven is sometimes no more than an Ideal World of abstracted Beings; and so every Motion which rises in the Mind of Man is attri∣buted to the Quality to which it belongs, with the Name of the Deity who is suppos'd to preside over that Quality super∣added to it. In this Sense the present Allegory is easy enough. <HI>Pandarus</HI> thinks it <HI>Prudence</HI> to gain Honour and Wealth at the Hands of the <HI>Trojans</HI> by destroying <HI>Menelaus.</HI> This Sen∣timent is also incited by a Notion of <HI>Glory,</HI> of which <HI>Juno</HI> is represented as Goddess. <HI>Jupiter</HI> who is suppos'd to know

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 120.

For a Proof of this, he puts us in Mind how <HI>Mi∣nerva</HI> when she would persuade the <HI>Greeks,</HI> seeks for <HI>Ulysses;</HI> when she would break the Truce, for <HI>Pandarus;</HI> and when she would conquer, for <HI>Diomed.</HI> If we consult the <HI>Scholia</HI> upon this Instance, they give several Reasons why <HI>Pandarus</HI> was particularly proper for the Occasion. The Goddess went not to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> because they hated <HI>Paris,</HI> and (as we are told in the end of the foregoing Book) would rather have given him up, than have done an ill Action for him: She therefore looks among the Allies, and finds <HI>Pandarus</HI> who was of a Nation noted for Perfidiousness, and had a Soul ava∣ricious enough to be capable of engaging in this Treachery for the hopes of a Reward from <HI>Paris:</HI> as appears by his be∣ing so covetous as not to bring Horses to the Siege for fear of the Expence or Loss of them; as he tells <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the fifth Book.</P>

of a Peace, makes the Conditions be here broken af∣ter such a manner, as should oblige the <HI>Greeks</HI> to act thro' the War with that irreconcileable Fury which affords him the Opportunity of exerting the full Fire of his own Genius. The Shot of <HI>Pandarus</HI> being therefore of such Consequence (and as he calls it, the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>Foundation of future Woes</HI>) it was thought fit not to pass it over in a few Words, like the Flight of every common Arrow, but to give it a Descrip∣tion some way corresponding to its Importance.

It may be observed too, how proper a time it was to expatiate in these Particulars; when the Armies being unemploy'd, and only one Man acting, the Poet and his Readers had leisure to be the Spectators of a single and deliberate Action.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 163. <HI>Wafts the wing'd Hornet.</HI>]</Q> This is one of those humble Comparisons which <HI>Homer</HI> sometimes uses to diversify his Subject, but a very exact one in its kind, and corresponding in all its Parts. The Care of the Goddess, the unsuspecting Security of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> the Ease with which she diverts the Danger, and the Danger itself, are all included in this short Compass. To which it may be added, that if the Providence of heavenly Powers to their Creatures is exprest by the Love of a Mother to her Child, if Men in regard to them are but as heedless sleeping Infants, and if those Dangers which may seem great to us, are by them as easily warded off as the Simile implies; there will appear something sublime in this Conception, however little or low the Image may be thought at first sight in respect to a Heroe. A higher Comparison would but have tended to lessen the Dis∣parity between the Gods and Man, and the Justness of the Simile had been lost, as well as the Grandeur of the Sentiment.</P>

The first is, that whoever in fighting upon his Chariot shall win a Chariot from his Enemy, he shall continue to fight, and not retire from the Engagement to secure his Prize. The second, that if any one be thrown out of his Chariot, he who happens to be nearest shall hold forth his Javelin to help him up into his own. The third is directly the contrary to the last, that if any one be cast from his Chariot and would mount up into another Man's, that other shall push him back with his Javelin, and not admit him for fear of interrupting the Com∣bate. The fourth is the Sense which is followed in the Trans∣lation as seeming much the most natural, that every one should be left to govern his own Chariot, and the other who is admitted fight only with the Javelin. The reason of this Advice appears by the Speech of <HI>Pandarus</HI> to <HI>Aeneas</HI> in the next Book: <HI>Aeneas</HI> having taken him up into his Chariot to go against <HI>Diomed,</HI> compliments him with the Choice ei∣ther to fight, or to manage the Reins, which was esteem'd an Office of Honour.

The word <HI>populatus</HI> here has a Beauty which one must be in∣sensible not to observe. <HI>Scaliger</HI> prefers <HI>Virgil</HI>'s, and <HI>Ma∣crobius Homer</HI>'s, without any Reasons on either side, but only one Critick's positive Word against another's. The Reader may judge between them.</P>

But may it not be answer'd that such a Place as this, where all things are in Confusion, seems not to admit of any Si∣mile, except of one which scarce exceeds a Metaphor in Length? When two Heroes are engag'd, there is a plain View to be given us of their Actions, and there a long Si∣mile may be of use, to raise and enliven them by parallel Circumstances; but when the Troops fall in promiscuously upon one another, the Conclusion excludes distinct or parti∣ticular Images, and consequently Comparisons of any Length would be less natural.</P>

<L>Congemuit, traxitque jugis avulsa ruinam.</L></Q> Mr. <HI>Hobbes</HI> in the Preface to his Translation of <HI>Homer</HI> has discours'd upon this Occasion very judiciously. <HI>Homer</HI> (says he) intended no more in this Place than to shew how comely the Body of <HI>Simoisius</HI> appear'd as he lay dead upon the Bank of <HI>Scamander,</HI> strait and tall, with a fair Head of Hair, like a strait and high Poplar with the Boughs still on; and not at all to describe the manner of his falling, which (when a Man is wounded thro' the Breast as he was with a Spear) is always sudden. <HI>Virgil</HI>'s is the Description of a great Tree falling when many Men together hew it down. He meant to compare the manner how <HI>Troy</HI> after many Battels, and after the Loss of many Cities, conquer'd by the many Nations under <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in a long War, was thereby wea∣ken'd and at last overthrown, with a great Tree hewn round about, and then falling by little and little leisurely. So that neither these two Descriptions nor the two Comparisons can be compared together. The Image of a Man lying on the Ground is one thing; the Image of falling (especially of a Kingdom) is another. This therefore gives no Advantage to <HI>Virgil</HI> over <HI>Homer.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>Hobbes.</HI></P>

<P>The Reader will excuse our taking notice of such a Trifle, as that it was an old Superstition, that this fourth Book of the <HI>Iliads</HI> being laid under the Head, was a Cure for the <HI>Quartan Ague.
