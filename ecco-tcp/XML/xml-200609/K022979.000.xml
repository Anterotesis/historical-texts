<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE ESSAY ON MAN was intended to have been comprised in Four Books:</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> of which, the Author has given us under that title, in four Epistles.
The <HI>Second</HI> was to have consisted of the same number: 1. Of the extent and li∣mits
of human Reason. 2. Of those Arts and Sciences, and of the parts of them,
which are useful, and therefore attainable, together with those which are unuseful, and
therefore unattainable. 3. Of the Nature, Ends, Use, and Application of the diffe∣rent
Capacities of Men. 4. Of the Use of Learning, of the Science of the World,
and of Wit: concluding with a Satyr against the Misapplication of them, illustrated by
Pictures, Characters, and Examples.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> Book regarded Civil Regimen, or the Science of Politics, in which the
several forms of a Republic were to have been examined and explained; together with the
several Modes of Religious Worship, as far forth as they affect Society; between which,
the Author always supposed there was the most interesting relation and closest con∣nection;
so that this part would have treated of Civil and Religious Society in their full
extent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fourth</HI> and last Book concerned private Ethics or practical Morality, considered
in all the Circumstances, Orders, Professions, and Stations of human Life.</P>
<P>The Scheme of all this had been maturely digested, and communicated to the L.
Bolinbroke. Dr Swift, and one or two more, and was intended for the only work of
his riper Years: But was, partly thro' ill health, partly thro' discouragements from
the depravity of the times, and partly on prudential and other considerations, inter∣rupted,
postponed, and, lastly, in a manner laid aside.</P>
<P>But as this was the Author's favourite Work, which more exactly reflected the Image
of his strong capacious Mind, and as we can have but a very imperfect idea of it from the
<HI>disjecta membra Poetae</HI> that now remain, it may not be amiss to be a little more particu∣lar
concerning each of these projected books.</P>
<P>The FIRST, as it treats of Man in the abstract, and considers him in general under
every of his relations, becomes the foundation, and furnishes out the subjects, of the
<HI>three</HI> following; so that</P>
<P>The SECOND Book takes up again the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Second</HI> Epistles of the <HI>First</HI> Book,
and treats of man in his intellectual Capacity at large, as has been explained above. Of
this, only a small part of the conclusion (which, as we said, was to have contained
a Satyr against the misapplication of Wit and Learning) may be found in the <HI>Fourth</HI>
Book of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and up and down, occasionally, in the other <HI>three.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
The <HI>Third</HI> Book, in like manner, reassumes the subject of the <HI>Third</HI> Epistle of the
<HI>First,</HI> which treats of Man in his Social, Political, and Religious Capacity. But this
part the Poet afterwards conceived might be best executed in an EPIC POEM; as the
Action would make it more animated, and the Fable less invidious; in which all the great
Principles of true and false Governments and Religions should be chiefly delivered in
feigned Examples. In pursuance of this design, he plan'd out a Poem on the subject
of the fabulous BRUTUS, the great Grandson of Aeneas: whose first and predominant
principle he makes to be Benevolence; from this Ruling Passion arises a strong desire
to redeem the remains of his countrymen, then captives amongst the Greeks, from
slavery and misery, and to establish their freedom and felicity on a just form of
Civil Government. He had seen how false Policy, and Superstitions and Vices proceed∣ing
from it, had caused the ruin of Troy; and he was enabled to avoid the <HI>one</HI> by the
lights his countrymen, whom he had now gathered from their dispersion, could afford
him from their observations on the various policies of the Grecian Cities; and to reform
the <HI>other</HI> by the Wisdom he himself had gained in Italy, where Evander, as we are told
by Virgil, had reformed the reigning Superstitions:
<Q><L><HI>Rex Evandrus ait: non haec sollemnia nobis</HI></L>
<L><HI>Vana superstitio veterumque ignara Deorum</HI></L>
<L><HI>Imposuit—</HI></L></Q>
Thus qualified for the office of Legislation, he puts to sea with a number of brave follow∣ers;
enters the Atlantic Ocean; and after various traverses (each of which produces some
new lesson of Politics) he arrives in Britain, where having surmounted many successive
difficulties, which bring him still nearer and nearer to the point the poet aims at, he at
length establishes for his Trojans that perfect form of Civil Government which it was
our author's purpose to recommend. The poem opens (of which very few lines of
the introduction only were written) with Brutus at the Straits of Calpé, in sight of the
<HI>ne plus ultra</HI> on Hercules's Pillars, debating in councel whether he should enter the
great ocean.</P>
<P>The FOURTH and last Book pursues the subject of the <HI>Fourth</HI> Epistle of the <HI>First,</HI> and
treats of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or practical Morality; and would have consisted of many members; of
of which the four following Epistles were detached Portions: the <HI>two first,</HI> on the <HI>Cha∣racters
of Men and Women</HI> being the <HI>introductory</HI> part of this concluding Book.</P>

<HEAD>EPISTLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To Sir RICHARD TEMPLE,
Lord Viscount COBHAM.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="argument">
<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT of the FIRST EPISTLE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Of the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of MEN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it is not sufficient for this knowledge to consider Man in the <HI>Abs∣tract</HI>:
<HI>Books</HI> will not serve the purpose, nor yet our own <HI>Experience</HI> singly,
℣ 1. General maxims, unless they be form'd upon <HI>both,</HI> will be but no∣tional,
℣ 10. Some Peculiarity in every man, characteristic to himself,
yet varying from himself, ℣ 15. Difficulties arising from our own Passi∣ons,
Fancies, Faculties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ℣ 31. The shortness of Life, to observe in,
and the uncertainty of the <HI>Principles of action</HI> in men, to observe by, ℣
37, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our <HI>own</HI> Principle of action often bid from ourselves, ℣ 41.
Some few Characters plain, but in general confounded, dissembled, or incon∣sistent,
℣ 51. The same man utterly different in different place and sea∣sons,
℣ 71. Unimaginable weaknesses in the greatest, ℣ 70, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> No∣thing
constant and certain but <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> ℣ 95. No judging
of the <HI>Motives</HI> from the actions; the same actions proceeding from con∣trary
Motives, and the same Motives influencing contrary actions, ℣ 100.
II. Yet to form <HI>Characters,</HI> we can only take the <HI>strongest actions</HI> of a
man's life, and try to make them <HI>agree:</HI> The utter uncertainty of this,
from <HI>Nature</HI> itself, and from <HI>Policy,</HI> ℣ 120. <HI>Characters</HI> given according
to the <HI>rank</HI> of men of the world, ℣ 135. And some reason for it, ℣ 140.
<HI>Education</HI> alters the <HI>Nature,</HI> or at least <HI>Character</HI> of many, ℣ 149.
<HI>Actions, Passions, Opinions, Manners, Humours,</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> all sub∣ject
to change. No judging by <HI>Nature, from</HI> ℣ 158 to 178. III. It only
remains to find (if we can) his <HI>RULING PASSION</HI>: That will certainly
influence all the rest, and can reconcile the seeming or real inconsistency of
all his actions, ℣ 175. Instanced in the extraordinary character of <HI>Clo∣dio,</HI>
℣ 179. A caution against mistaking <HI>second qualities</HI> for <HI>first,</HI> which
will destroy all possibility of the knowledge of mankind, ℣ 210. Examples
of the strength of the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> and its continuation to the last
breath, ℣ 222, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<L>YES, you despise the man to Books confin'd,</L>
<L>Who from his study rails at human kind;</L>
<L>Tho' what he learns, he speaks and may advance</L>
<L>Some gen'ral maxims, or be right by chance.</L>
<L N="5"><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
The coxcomb bird, so talkative and grave,</L>
<L>That from his cage cries Cuckold, Whore, and Knave,</L>
<L>Tho' many a passenger he rightly call,</L>
<L>You hold him no Philosopher at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet the fate of all extremes is such,</L>
<L N="10">Men may be read, as well as Books too much.</L>
<L>To Observations which ourselves we make,</L>
<L>We grow more partial for th' observer's sake;</L>
<L>To written Wisdom, as another's, less:</L>
<L>Maxims are drawn from Notions, those from Guess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
<L N="15">There's some Peculiar in each leaf and grain,</L>
<L>Some unmark'd fibre, or some varying vein:</L>
<L>Shall only Man be taken in the gross?</L>
<L>Grant but as many sorts of Mind as Moss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That each from other differs, first confess;</L>
<L N="20">Next, that he varies from himself no less:</L>
<L>Add Nature's, Custom's, Reason's, Passion's strife,</L>
<L>And all Opinion's colours cast on life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<L>Our depths who fathoms, or our shallows finds,</L>
<L>Quick whirls, and shifting eddies, of our minds?</L>
<L N="25">On human actions reason tho' you can,</L>
<L>It may be reason, but it is not man:</L>
<L>His Principle of action once explore,</L>
<L>That instant 'tis his Principle no more.</L>
<L>Like following life thro' creatures you dissect,</L>
<L N="30">You lose it in the moment you detect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more; the diff'rence is as great between</L>
<L>The optics seeing, as the objects seen.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
All Manners take a tincture from our own,</L>
<L>Or come discolour'd thro' our Passions shown.</L>
<L N="35">Or Fancy's beam enlarges, multiplies,</L>
<L>Contracts, inverts, and gives ten thousand dyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor will Life's stream for Observation stay,</L>
<L>It hurries all too fast to mark their way.</L>
<L>In vain sedate reflections we wou'd make,</L>
<L N="40">When half our knowledge we must snatch, not take.</L>
<L>Oft in the Passions' wild rotation tost</L>
<L>Our spring of action to ourselves is lost:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
Tir'd, not determin'd, to the last we yield,</L>
<L>And what comes then is master of the field.</L>
<L N="45">As the last image of that troubled heap,</L>
<L>When Sense subsides, and Fancy sports in sleep,</L>
<L>(Tho' past the recollection of the thought)</L>
<L>Becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought:</L>
<L>Something as dim to our internal view,</L>
<L N="50">Is thus, perhaps, the cause of most we do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True, some are open, and to all men known;</L>
<L>Others so very close, they're hid from none;</L>
<L>(So Darkness strikes the sense no less than Light)</L>
<L>Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at sight,</L>
<L N="55">And ev'ry child hates Shylock, tho' his soul</L>
<L>Still sits at squat, and peeps not from its hole.</L>
<L>At half mankind when gen'rous Manly raves,</L>
<L>All know 'tis Virtue, for he thinks them knaves:</L>
<L>When universal homage Umbra pays,</L>
<L N="60">All see 'tis Vice, and itch of vulgar praise.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
When Flatt'ry glares, all hate it in a Queen,</L>
<L>While one there is who charms us with his Spleen,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But these plain Characters we rarely find;</L>
<L>Tho' strong the bent, yet quick the turns of mind:</L>
<L N="65">Or puzzling Contraries confound the whole,</L>
<L>Or Affectations quite reverse the soul.</L>
<L>The Dull, flat Falshood serves for policy,</L>
<L>And in the Cunning, Truth itself's a lye:</L>
<L>Unthought-of Frailties cheat us in the Wise,</L>
<L N="70">The Fool lies hid in inconsistencies.</L>

<L>See the same man, in vigour, in the gout;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L N="95">Know, God and Nature only are the same:</L>
<L>In Man, the judgment shoots at flying game,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="14"/>
A bird of passage! gone as soon as found,</L>
<L>Now in the Moon perhaps, now under ground.</L>

Infer the Motive from the Deed, and shew,</L>
<L>That what we chanc'd was what we meant to do.</L>
<L>Behold! If Fortune or a Mistress frowns,</L>
<L>Some plunge in bus'ness, others shave their crowns:</L>
<L N="105">To ease the Soul of one oppressive weight,</L>
<L>This quits an Empire, that embroils a State:</L>
<L>The same adust complexion has impell'd</L>
<L>Charles to the Convent, Philip to the Field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not always Actions shew the man: we find</L>
<L N="110">Who does a kindness, is not therefore kind,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="16"/>
Perhaps Prosperity becalm'd his breast,</L>
<L>Perhaps the Wind just shifted from the east:</L>
<L>Not therefore humble he who seeks retreat,</L>
<L>Pride guides his steps, and bids him shun the great:</L>
<L N="115">Who combats bravely is not therefore brave,</L>
<L>He dreads a death-bed like the meanest slave:</L>
<L>Who reasons wisely is not therefore wise,</L>
<L>His pride in Reas'ning, not in Acting lies.</L>
</LG>

<L>But grant that Actions best discover man;</L>

<L>The plain rough Hero turn a crafty Knave?</L>
<L>Alas! in truth the man but chang'd his mind,</L>

<L>Ask why from Britain Caesar would retreat?</L>
<L N="130">Caesar himself might whisper he was beat.</L>
<L>Why risk the world's great empire for a Punk?</L>

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE I.] This Epistle is divided into three principal parts or members: The First
[from ℣ 1 to 99.] treats of the difficulties in coming at the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and true <HI>Chara∣cters
of Men.</HI>—The Second [from ℣ 98 to 173.] of the <HI>wrong means</HI> which both <HI>Philo∣sophers</HI>
and <HI>Men of the World</HI> have employed in surmounting those difficulties. And the
Third [from ℣ 174 to the end] treats of the <HI>right means</HI> with directions for the ap∣plication
of them.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Yes, you despise the man,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> The Epistle is introduced [from ℣ 1 to 15]
in observing, that the <HI>Knowledge of Men</HI> is neither to be gained by Books nor Experi∣ence
alone, but by the joint use of both; for that the <HI>Maxims</HI> of the <HI>Philosopher,</HI> and
the <HI>Conclusions</HI> of the <HI>Man of the World</HI> can, separately, but supply a vague and super∣ficial
knowledge: And often not so much, as those <HI>Maxims</HI> are founded in the abstract
<HI>notions</HI> of the writer; and these <HI>conclusions</HI> are drawn from the uncertain <HI>conjectures</HI> of
the observer: But when the writer joins his <HI>speculation</HI> to the <HI>experience</HI> of the observer,
his <HI>notions</HI> are rectified into <HI>principles</HI>; and when the observer regulates his <HI>experience</HI>
on the <HI>general principles</HI> of the writer, his <HI>conjectures</HI> advance into <HI>science.</HI> Such is the
reasoning of this introduction; which besides its propriety to the general subject
of the Epistle, has a peculiar relation to each of its parts or members: For the
<HI>causes of the difficulty</HI> in coming at the knowledge and characters of men, explained
in the First, will shew the importance of what is here delivered, of the <HI>joint</HI> assistance
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
of speculation and practice to surmount it; and the <HI>wrong means</HI> which both <HI>philoso∣phers</HI>
and <HI>men of the world</HI> have employed in overcoming those difficulties discoursed of
in the Second, have their source here deduced, which is seen to be a <HI>separate</HI> adherence
of each to his own method of studying men, and a mutual contempt of the others.
Lastly, the <HI>right means</HI> delivered in the Third, will be of little use in the application,
without the direction here delivered: For tho' <HI>observation</HI> discovered a <HI>ruling passion,</HI>
yet, without a <HI>philosophic</HI> knowledge of the human mind, we may easily mistake a
<HI>secondary</HI> and <HI>subsidiary</HI> passion for the <HI>principal,</HI> and so be never the nearer in the
Knowledge of Men. But the elegant and easy <HI>Form</HI> of the <HI>introduction</HI> equals the Pro∣priety
of its <HI>matter</HI>; for the Epistle being addressed to a noble person, distinguished for
his knowledge of the World, it opens, as it were, in the midst of a familiar converse,
which lets us at once into his character; where the poet, by affecting <HI>only</HI> to ridicule
the useless Knowledge of Men confined to Books, and under the appearance of extolling
only that acquired by the World, artfully insinuates how equally defective this may be,
when conducted on the same narrow principle: Which is too often the case, as <HI>men of
the world</HI> are more than ordinarily prejudiced in favour of their own observations for
the sake of the observer, and, for the same reason, less indulgent to the discoveries of
others.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/><Q REND="inline">VER. 15. <L><HI>There's some peculiar,</HI> &amp;c.]</L></Q> The poet enters on the First division of his
subject, <HI>the difficulties of coming at the Knowledge and true Characters of Men.</HI> The
I. cause of this difficulty, which he prosecutes from ℣ 14 to 19. is the great <HI>diversity
of Characters,</HI> of which, to abate our wonder, and not discourage our inquiry, he only
desires we would <HI>grant</HI> him
<Q><L><HI>— but as many sorts of Mind as Moss.</HI></L></Q>
Hereby artfully insinuating, that if Nature has varied the most worthless vegetable into
above three hundred species, we need not wonder at the like diversity in the human
mind: And if a variety in that vegetable has been thought of importance enough to
employ the leisure of a serious enquirer, much more will the same quality in this
master-piece of Nature deserve our study and attention.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 19. <L><HI>That each from other differs, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A second cause of this difficulty [from
℣ 18 to 21.] is <HI>Man's inconstancy,</HI> whereby not only one man differs from another,
but each man from himself.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 21. <L><HI>Add Nature's, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A third cause [from ℣ 20 to 23.] is that <HI>obscurity</HI>
thrown over the Characters of men, thro' the strife and contest between <HI>nature</HI> and
<HI>custom,</HI> between <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>appetite,</HI> between <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>opinion.</HI> And as most men,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
either thro' <HI>education, temperature,</HI> or <HI>profession,</HI> have their Characters warp'd by <HI>custom,</HI>
<HI>appetite,</HI> and <HI>opinion,</HI> the obscurity arising from thence almost universal.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 23. <L><HI>Our depths who fathoms, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A fourth cause from ℣ 20 to 25. is deep
<HI>dissimulation,</HI> and restless <HI>caprice,</HI> whereby the shallows of the mind are as difficult to
be <HI>found,</HI> as the depths of it to be <HI>fathom'd.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 25. <L><HI>On human actions, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> A fifth cause [from ℣ 24 to 31.] is the sudden
change of his <HI>Principle of action,</HI> either on the point of its being laid open and de∣tected,
or thro' mere inconstancy.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 31. <L><HI>Yet more; the difference, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Hitherto the poet hath spoken of the causes
of difficulty arising from the <HI>obseurity of the Object</HI>; he now comes to those which pro∣ceed
from <HI>defects in the Observer.</HI> The First of which, and a sixth cause of difficulty,
he shews [from ℣ 30 to 57.] is the perverse <HI>manners, affections,</HI> and <HI>imagination</HI> of the
observer, whereby the Characters of others are rarely seen either in their true <HI>light,</HI>
<HI>complexion,</HI> or <HI>proportion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 37. <L><HI>Nor will Life's stream for Observation, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The Second of these, and seventh
cause of difficulty [from ℣ 36 to 41.] is the <HI>shortness of human life,</HI> which will not
suffer the observer to select and weigh out his knowledge, but just to snatch it as it
rolls rapidly by him down the current of Time.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 41. <L><HI>Oft in the Passions', &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> We come now to the eighth and last cause,
which very properly concludes the account, as, in a sort, it sums up all the difficulties
in one [from ℣ 40 to 51.] namely, that very often the <HI>man himself is ignorant of his
own motive of action</HI>; the cause of which ignorance our author has admirably explain'd:
When the mind (says he) is now quite tired out by the long conflict of opposite mo∣tives,
it withdraws its attention, and suffers the <HI>will</HI> to be seized upon by the first that
afterwards obtrudes itself, without taking notice what that motive is. This is finely
illustrated by what he supposes the general cause of dreams; where the fancy just let
loose possesses itself of the <HI>last image</HI> which it meets with on the confines between sleep
and waking, and on that eracts all its visionary operation; yet this image is, with great
difficulty, recollected; and never, but when some accident happens to interrupt our
first slumbers: Then (which proves the truth of the hypothesis) we are sometimes able to
trace the workings of the Fancy backwards, from image to image, in a chain, till we
come to that from whence they all arose.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 51. <L><HI>True, some are open, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now in answer to all this, an <HI>objector,</HI> as
the author shews [from ℣ 50 to 61.] may say, <Q REND="inline">"That these difficulties seem to be aggra∣vated:
For many Characters are so plainly marked, that no man can mistake them:
And not so only in the more <HI>open</HI> and <HI>frank,</HI> but in the very <HI>closest</HI> and most <HI>recluse</HI>
likewise."</Q> Of each of which the objector gives an instance, whereby it appears, that
the forbidding closeness and concealed hypocrisy in the one, are as conspicuous to all
mankind, as the gracious openness and frank plain-dealing of the other. — The
Reader sees this objection is more particularly level'd at the doctrine of ℣ 23.
<Q><L><HI>Our</HI> depths <HI>who fathoms, and our</HI> shallows <HI>finds?</HI></L></Q>
for it here endeavours to prove, that both are equally explorable.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 63. <L><HI>But these plain Characters, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> To this objection, therefore, our au∣thor
replies [from ℣ 60 to 67.] that indeed the fact may be true in the instances
given, but that such <HI>plain characters</HI> are extremely rare: And for the truth of this,
he not only appeals to experience, but explains the causes of it: 1. The First of
which is, the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination</HI>; for that when the bias of the Passions is
enough determined to mark out the Character, yet then, as the vigour of the Fancy
generally rises in proportion to the strength of the Appetites, the one no sooner directs
the bias, than the other reverses it,
<Q><L><HI>Tho'</HI> strong <HI>the bent, yet</HI> quick <HI>the turns of mind.</HI></L></Q>
2. A Second cause is the <HI>contrariety of Appetites,</HI> which drawing several ways, as <HI>Avarice</HI>
and <HI>Luxury, Ambition</HI> and <HI>Indolence, &amp;c.</HI> they must needs make the same Character in∣consistent
to itself, and consequently inexplicable to the observer,
<Q><L><HI>Or puzzling</HI> Contraries <HI>confound the whole.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 66. <L><HI>Or Affectations, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> 3. A Third cause is <HI>Affectation,</HI> that aspires to qua∣lities,
which neither <HI>nature</HI> nor <HI>education</HI> has given us, and which, consequently, nei∣ther
<HI>art</HI> nor <HI>use</HI> will ever render graceful or becoming. On this account it is, he well
observes, that <HI>Affectation reverses the soul</HI>; other <HI>natural passions</HI> may indeed turn it
from that bias which the <HI>ruling one</HI> has given it; but the <HI>affected passions</HI> distort all its
faculties, and cramp all its operations; so that it acts with the same constraint that a
tumbler walks upon his hands.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 69. <L><HI>Unthought of frailties, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> 4. A Fourth cause lies in the <HI>Inequalities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the human mind,</HI> which expose the <HI>wise</HI> to unexpected frailties, and conduct the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to as unlooked for wisdom.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 71. <L><HI>See the same man, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Of all these Four <HI>causes</HI> he here gives examples:
1. Of the <HI>vivacity of the Imagination,</HI> from ℣ 71 to 77. — 2. Of the <HI>contrariety of
Appetites,</HI> from ℣ 77 to 80. — 3. Of <HI>Affectation,</HI> from ℣ 86 to 90. — and 4. Of the
<HI>Inequalities of the human mind,</HI> from ℣ 86 to 95.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="13"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 95. <L><HI>Know God and Nature, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus proved what he had proposed,
the <HI>premisses</HI> naturally lead him into a moral reflexion, with which he concludes his
<HI>first part,</HI> namely, that constancy is to be expected in no human Character whatsoever,
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
but to be found only in God and his Laws: That as to Man, he is not only perpetu∣ally
shifting and varying, even while <HI>within the verge</HI> of his own nature; but is fre∣quently
flying out into each extreme both <HI>above</HI> and <HI>below</HI> it: Now associating in good

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 99. <L><HI>In vain the Sage, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The author having shewn the difficulties in com∣ing
to the Knowledge and true Characters of men, enters now upon the <HI>second division</HI> of
his Poem, which is <HI>of the wrong means that both Philosophers and Men of the world
have employed in surmounting those difficulties.</HI> He had, in the Introduction, spoken of
the absurd conduct of both, in despising the assistance of each other: He now justifies
his censure by an examination of their peculiar doctrines; and, to take them in their
own way, considers them, as they would be considered, <HI>separately.</HI> And <HI>first,</HI> of the
<HI>Philosopher,</HI> whose principal mistake is in supposing <HI>that Actions best decipher</HI> the <HI>Mo∣tive
of the actor.</HI> This he confutes [from ℣ 99 to 109.] by shewing that <HI>different
Actions</HI> proceed often from the <HI>same motive</HI>; whether of <HI>accident,</HI> as disappointed views;
or of <HI>temperature,</HI> as an adust complexion; which he thus illustrates,
<Q><L><HI>Behold if Fortune or a Mistress frown, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
In judging therefore of <HI>Motives</HI> by <HI>Actions,</HI> the Philosopher must needs be frequently
misled; because the passion or appetite which, when impelling to <HI>Action,</HI> we call the
<HI>Motive,</HI> may be equally gratified in the pursuit of quite different measures.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 109. <L><HI>Not always Actions shew the man, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The Philosopher's <HI>second</HI> mistake
is, that <HI>Actions decipher the character of the actor.</HI> This too, the author confutes [from
℣ 118 to 135.] and, as in correcting the foregoing mistake, he proved, <HI>that different
Actions often proceed from the same Motive</HI>; so here he proves, <HI>that the same Actions often
proceeds from different Motives</HI>; thus a <HI>kind Action,</HI> he observes, as commonly arises
from the accidents of prosperity or fine weather, as from a natural disposition to huma∣nity;
a <HI>modest Action,</HI> as well from pride as humility; a <HI>brave Action,</HI> as easily from
habit or fashion, as magnanimity; and a <HI>prudent Action</HI> as often from vanity as wisdom.
Now the <HI>Character</HI> being really determined by the <HI>Motives,</HI> and various, nay contrary
<HI>Motives</HI> producing the same <HI>Action,</HI> the <HI>Action</HI> can never decipher the <HI>Character of the
actor.</HI> But further (continues the poet) if we attend to what has been said, we shall
discover another circumstance in the case, that will not only make it extremely diffi∣cult,
but absolutely impracticable to decipher the Character by the Action; and that is,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
the <HI>discordancy of Action</HI> in the same Character; a necessary consequence of the two prin∣ciples
proved above, that <HI>different Actions proceed from the same Motive,</HI> and that <HI>the same
Action proceeds from different Motives.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 119. <L><HI>But grant that Actions, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> If you will judge of man by his <HI>Actions,</HI>
you are not to selected such only as you like, or can manage, you must fairly take all
you find: But, when you have got these together, they will prove so very discordant
that no consistent Character can possibly be made out of them. What is then to be
done? Will you <HI>suppress</HI> all those you cannot reconcile to the few capital Actions
which you chuse for the foundation of your Character? But this the laws of truth will
not allow of. Will you then miscall them? and say they were not the natural work∣ings
of the man, but the disguises of the politician? But what will you get by that,
but the very reversing the best known Character, and making the owner of it the
direct opposite of himself? And this (says our author) the reasoning and philosophic
historian has always been ready to do with the <HI>Actions</HI> of great men; of which he
gives two famous instances in the life of Caefar. The conclusion from the whole is,
that <HI>Actions do not shew the Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="17"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 135. <L><HI>'Tis from high Life, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The poet having done with the <HI>Philosopher,</HI>
now turns to the <HI>Man of the world</HI>; whose <HI>first</HI> mistake is in supposing men's true
<HI>Characters may be known by their station.</HI> This, tho' a mere mob-opinion, is the opi∣nion
in fashion, and cherished by the Mob of all ranks; therefore, tho' beneath the
poet's reasoning, he thought it deserving of his ridicule; and the strongest was what
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
he gives [from ℣ 134 to 141.] a naked exposition of the fact; to which he has sub∣joined
[from ℣ 140 to 149.] an ironical apology, that, as Virtue is cultivated with in∣finitely
more labour in Courts than in Cottages, it is but just to set an infinitely higher
value on it; which, says he, with much pleasantry, is most agreeable to all the fashion∣able
ways of estimation. For why do the connoisseurs prefer the lively colour in a
Gem before that in a Flower, but for its extreme rarity and difficulty of production?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 149. <L><HI>'Tis Education forms, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> This <HI>second</HI> mistake of the <HI>Man of the</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<HI>world</HI> is more serious; it is, that <HI>Characters are best judged of by the general Manners.</HI>
This the poet confutes in a lively enumeration of examples [from ℣ 148 to 158.]
which shew, that how similar or different soever the <HI>Manners</HI> be by <HI>Nature,</HI> yet they
are all new model'd by <HI>Education</HI> and <HI>Profession</HI>; where each man invariably receives
that exotic form which the mould he falls into is fitted to imprint. The <HI>natural Cha∣racter</HI>
therefore can never be judged of by these <HI>fictitious Manners.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 158. <L><HI>Ask mens Opinions, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The <HI>third</HI> mistake is in judging of mens Cha∣racters
by their <HI>Opinions and turn of thinking.</HI> But these the poet shews, by two ex∣amples
[from ℣ 157 to 166.] are generally swayed by <HI>Interest,</HI> both in the <HI>affairs of
Life</HI> and <HI>Speculation.</HI></P>

both of the <HI>Philosopher</HI> and <HI>Man of the world,</HI> turns now to <HI>both</HI>; and [from ℣ 165
to 174.] jointly addresses them in a <HI>recapitulation</HI> of his reasoning against <HI>both:</HI> He
shews, that if we pretend to disenvelope the <HI>Character</HI> by the <HI>natural disposition in ge∣neral,</HI>
we shall find it extremely difficult, because this is often <HI>effaced</HI> by <HI>Habit, over∣swayed</HI>
by <HI>Interest,</HI> and <HI>suspended</HI> by <HI>Policy.</HI> — If by <HI>Actions,</HI> their contrariety will
leave us in utter doubt and uncertainty. — If by <HI>Passions,</HI> we shall be perpetually mis∣led
by the mask of <HI>Dissimulation.</HI> — If by <HI>Opinions,</HI> all these things concur together
to perplex the enquiry. Shew us, therefore, says he, in the whole range of your
<HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> the thing we can be <HI>certain</HI> of: For (to sum up all in a
word)
<Q><L>Manners <HI>with Fortunes,</HI> Humours <HI>turn with Climes,</HI></L>

and last part; which treats of the <HI>right means</HI> of surmounting the difficulties in com∣ing
to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Characters of men:</HI> This, the poet shews, is <HI>by investigating
the</HI> RULING PASSION; of whose origin and nature we may find an exact account in

<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
convince us of which, he applies it [from ℣ 179 to 210.] to the most wild and incon∣sistent
Character that ever was; which (when drawn out at length in a spirit of poetry
as rare as the character itself) we see, this <HI>Principle</HI> unravels, and renders throughout
of one plain consistent thread.</P>

<Q REND="inline">VER. 210. <L><HI>Yet in the search, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But here [from ℣ 209 to 222.] he gives one
very necessary caution, that, in developing the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> we must be careful not
to mistake a <HI>subsidiary</HI> passion for the <HI>principal</HI>; which, without great attention, we
may be very liable to do; as the <HI>subsidiary,</HI> acting in support of the <HI>principal,</HI> has fre∣quently
all its <HI>vigour</HI> and much of its <HI>perseverance:</HI> This error has misled several both
of the ancient and modern historians; as when they supposed <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> to be
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
Characteristics of <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Lucullus</HI>; whereas, in truth, the <HI>Ruling Passion</HI> of both was
<HI>Ambition</HI>; which is so certain, that, at whatsoever different time of the Republic these
men had lived, their <HI>Ambition,</HI> as the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> had been the same; but a dif∣ferent
time had changed their <HI>subsidiary</HI> ones of <HI>Lust</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> into their very oppo∣sites
of <HI>Chastity</HI> and <HI>Frugality.</HI> 'Tis in vain, therefore, says our author, for the ob∣server
of human nature to six his attention on the <HI>Workman,</HI> if he all the while mis∣takes
the <HI>Scaffold</HI> for the <HI>Building.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 222. <L><HI>In this one Passion, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now it may be objected to our philoso∣phic
poet, that he has indeed shewn <HI>the true means</HI> of coming to <HI>the Knowledge and
Characters of men</HI> by a <HI>Principle</HI> certain and infallible, when found, yet, by his own
account, of so difficult investigation, that its <HI>Counterfeit,</HI> and it is always attended
with one, may be easily mistaken for it. To remove this difficulty, therefore, and
consequently the objection that arises from it, the poet has given [from ℣ 221 to 228.]
one certain and infallible criterion of the <HI>Ruling Passion,</HI> which is this, that all the
<HI>other</HI> passions, in the course of time, change and wear away; while <HI>this</HI> is ever con∣stant
and vigorous; and still going on from strength to strength, to the very moment
of its demolishing the miserable machine that it has now at length overworked. Of
this great truth, the poet [from ℣ 227 to the end] gives various instances in all the
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
principal <HI>Ruling Passions</HI> of our nature, as they are to be found in the <HI>Man of Busi∣ness,</HI>
the <HI>Man of Pleasure,</HI> the <HI>Epicure,</HI> the <HI>Parcimonious,</HI> the <HI>Toast,</HI> the <HI>Courtier,</HI>
the <HI>Miser,</HI> and the <HI>Patriot</HI>; which last instance the poet has had the art, under the

It may be worth while to enquire

honour of Religion. I take then the case
to be this: These men observing (and
none have equal opportunities) how per∣petually
public events fall out besides their
expectation, and contrary to the best-laid
schemes of worldly policy, cannot but
confess that human affairs are ordered by
some power extrinsical. To acknowledge
a God and his Providence would be next
to introducing a morality destructive of
that public system which they think ne∣cessary
for the government of the world.
They have recourse therefore to that ri∣diculous
and absurd scheme of Power
which rules by no other law than <HI>Fate</HI>
or <HI>Destiny.</HI> The consideration of this
perhaps was the reason that the poet,
to keep up decorum and to preserve the

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Nothing so true, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The
reader perhaps may be disappointed to find
that this <HI>Epistle,</HI> which proposes the same
subject with the preceding, is conducted
on very different rules of method; for
instead of being disposed in the same lo∣gical
connection, and filled with the like
philosophical remarks, it is wholly taken
up in drawing a great variety of capital
Characters: But if he would reflect,
that the <HI>two Sexes</HI> make but <HI>one Spe∣cies,</HI>
and consequently, that the Cha∣racters
of both must be studied and ex∣plained
on the same principles, he would
see, that when the poet had done this
in the preceding Epistle, his business here
was, not to repeat what he had already
delivered, but only to verify and illu∣strate
his doctrine, by every <HI>view</HI> of that
perplexity of Nature, which his philoso∣phy
only can explain. If the reader there∣fore
will but be at the pains to study
these Characters with any degree of at∣tention,
as they are here masterly drawn,
one important particular (for which the
poet has artfully prepared him by the in∣troduction)
will very forcibly strike his
observation; and that is, that all the great
strokes in the several Characters of <HI>Wo∣men</HI>
are not only infinitely perplexed and
discordant, like those in <HI>Men,</HI> but abso∣lutely
inconsistent, and in a much higher
degree <HI>contradictory.</HI> As strange as this
may appear, yet he will see that the poet
has all the while strictly follow'd Nature,
whose ways, we find by the former Epi∣stle
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
are not a little mysterious; and a
mystery this might have remained, had
not our author explained it at ℣ 207.
where he shuts up his <HI>Characters</HI> with this
philosophical reflexion:
<Q><L><HI>In Men, we</HI> various ruling Passions <HI>find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Women,</HI> two <HI>almost divide the kind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Those only fix'd they first or last obey,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The love of Pleasure, and the love of Sway.</HI></L></Q>
If this account be true, we see the per∣petual
necessity (which is not the case in
<HI>Men</HI>) that <HI>Women</HI> lye under of <HI>disguising</HI>
their <HI>ruling Passion.</HI> Now the variety of
arts employed to this purpose must needs
draw them into infinite contradictions in
those <HI>Actions</HI> from whence their general
and obvious Character is denominated:
To verify this observation, let the reader
examine all the Characters here drawn,
and try whether with this key he cannot
discover that all their Contradictions arise
from a desire to hide the <HI>ruling Passion.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not the worst. The poet
afterwards [from ℣ 219 to 248.] takes no∣tice
of another mischief arising from this
necessity of hiding their ruling Passions;
which is, that generally the end of each
is defeated even there where they are
most violently pursued: For the necessity
of hiding them inducing an habitual dissi∣pation
of mind, Reason, whose office it
is to regulate the <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> loses
all its force and direction; and these un∣happy
victims to their principles, tho'
with their attention still <HI>fixed</HI> upon them,
are ever prosecuting the means destructive
of their end, and thus become ridiculous
in youth, and miserable in old age.</P>
<P>Let me not omit to observe the great
beauty of the conclusion: It is an Enco∣mium
on the Lady to whom the Epistle
is addressed, and artfully turns upon the
fact which makes the subject of the Epi∣stle,
the <HI>contradiction of a Woman's Chara∣cter,</HI>
in which contradiction he shews that
all the lustre of the best Character consists.</P>
<Q><L><HI>And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Woman's at best a</HI> Contradiction <HI>still, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 5. <L><HI>How many pictures</HI>]</L></Q> The
poet's purpose here is to shew, that the
Characters of Women are generally in∣consistent
with themselves; and this he
illustrates by so happy a <HI>Similitude,</HI> that
we see the folly, described in it, arises
from that very principle which gives
birth to this inconsistency of Character.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 156. <L><HI>Cameleons who can paint in

does a very distinguished honour to the
accuracy of our poet's judgment, of which,
in the course of these observations, I have
given many instances, and shall here ex∣plain
in what it consists; it is this, that
the <HI>Similitudes</HI> in his didactic poems, of
which he is not sparing, and which are
highly poetical, are always chosen with
such exquisite discernment of Nature, as
not only to illustrate the particular point
he is upon, but to establish the general
principles he would inforce; so, in the
instance before us, he compares the in∣constancy
and contradiction in the Cha∣racters
of Women, to the change of
colours in the Chameleon; yet 'tis ne∣vertheless
the great principle of this poem
to shew that the general Characteristic of
the Sex, as to the Ruling Passion, which
they all have, is more uniform than that in
Man: Now for this purpose, all Nature
could not have supplied such another il∣lustration
as this of the Chameleon; for
tho' it instantaneously assumes much of
the colour of every subject on which it
chances to be placed, yet, as the most
accurate <HI>Virtuosi</HI> have observed, it has
two native colours of its own, which,
amidst all these charges are never totally
discharged, but, tho' often discoloured
by the neighbourhood of adventitious
ones, still make the foundation, and give
a tincture to all those which, from thence,
it occasionally assumes.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 157. <L><HI>Yet Cloe sure, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The
purpose of the poet in this Character is
important: It is to shew that the poli∣tic
or prudent government of the pas∣sions
is not enough to make a Chara∣cter
amiable, nor even to secure it from
being ridiculous, if the end of that go∣vernment
be not pursued, which is the
free exercise of the social appetites after
the selfish ones have been subdued; For
that if, tho' reason govern, the heart be
never consulted, we interest ourselves as
little in the fortune of such a Character,
as in any of the foregoing, which passi∣ons
or caprice drive up and down at ran∣dom.</P>

<Q REND="inline">VER. 181. <L><HI>One certain Portrait — the same for ever —</HI> ]</L></Q> This is intirely iro∣nical,
and conveys under it this general
moral truth, that there is, in life, no such

In the former Editions, between this and

might be perceived, occasion∣ed
by the omission of certain <HI>Exam∣ples</HI>

in the poet's management of his

he makes for them, in gradually

And the civil dismission he gives them by
the continuance of the same metaphor, in
the lines following, whereby the traces of
the imagery gradually decay, and give
place to others, and the reader is never of∣fended
with the sudden or abrupt disap∣pearance
of it,

The poet concludes his Epistle with a fine
<HI>Moral,</HI> that deserves the serious attention
of the public: It is this, that all the ex∣travagances
of these <HI>vicious</HI> Characters

wrong Education; and that even the <HI>best</HI>
are rather secured by a <HI>good natural</HI> than
by the prudence and providence of pa∣rents;
which observation is conveyed un∣der
the sublime classical machinery of
Phoebus in the ascendant, watching the
natal hour of his favourite, and averting
the ill effects of her parents mistaken
fondness: For Phoebus, as the god of
Wit, confers Genius, and, as one of the
astronomical influences, defeats the adven∣titious

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>Who shall decide, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The address of the <HI>Introduction</HI> [from ℣ 1 to 21.]
is remarkable: The poet represents-himself and the noble Lord his friend, as in a
conversation, philosophising on the <HI>final cause</HI> of <HI>Riches:</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
<HI>You</HI> (says our author)
<Q><L><HI>— hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</HI></L>
<LG>
<L><HI>But I, who think more highly of our kind, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Opine that Nature, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG></Q>
As much as to say, <Q REND="inline">"You, my Lord, hold the subject we are upon as fit only for
<HI>Satyr</HI>; I, on the contrary, esteem it a case of Philosophy and profound <HI>Ethics:</HI>
But as we both agree in the main <HI>Principle,</HI> that <HI>Riches were not given for the re∣ward
of Virtue, but for very different purposes</HI> [See <HI>Essay on Man,</HI> Ep. IV.] let us
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
compromise the matter, and consider the subject jointly, both under your idea and
mine, <HI>i. e. Satyrically</HI> and <HI>Philosophically.</HI>"</Q> — And this, in fact, we shall find to
be the true character of this poem, which is a <HI>Species</HI> peculiar to itself, and partaking
equally of the nature of his <HI>Ethic Epistles</HI> and his <HI>Satyrs,</HI> as the best pieces of
<HI>Lucian</HI> arose from a combination of the Dialogues of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the Scenes of <HI>Aristo∣phanes.</HI>
This it will be necessary to carry with us, if we would see either the <HI>Wit</HI>
or the <HI>Reasoning</HI> of this Epistle in their true light.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 21. <L><HI>What Nature wants, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus settled the terms of the <HI>Debate,</HI>
before he comes to the <HI>main Question,</HI> the <HI>Use of Riches,</HI> it was necessary to discuss a
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
<HI>previous</HI> one, whether indeed they are upon the whole, <HI>useful to mankind or not</HI>; [which
he does from ℣ 20 to 77.] It is commonly observed, says he [from ℣ 21 to 35.]
<HI>That Gold most commodiously supplies the wants of Nature:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Let us first consider the
proposition in <HI>general,</HI> both in <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Expression</HI>; 1. As it regards the <HI>Supply</HI>;
and this we shall find to be very <HI>unequal:</HI> 2. As it regards the <HI>Wants</HI>; and these,
we shall see, are very <HI>ambiguous</HI>; under that term, all our fantastic and imaginary
as well as real wants being comprized. Hitherto the use is not very apparent. Let
us in the second place, therefore, consider the proposition in <HI>particular,</HI> or how
Gold supplies the <HI>wants of Nature</HI> both in private and public life: 1. As to <HI>private</HI>;
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
it aids us, indeed, to support life; but it, at the same times, hires the assassin:
2. As to <HI>Society</HI>; it may procure Friendships and extend Trade; but it allures Rob∣bers
and corrupts our acquaintance. 3. As to <HI>Government</HI>; it pays the Guards ne∣cessary
for the support of public liberty; but it may, with the same ease, bribe a
Senate to overturn it."</Q></P>
<P>The matter therefore being thus problematical, the poet, instead of formally ba∣lancing
between the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Ill,</HI> chuses to leave this <HI>previous Question undetermined,</HI>
(as <HI>Tacitus</HI> had done before him; where, speaking of the ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> he says,
<HI>Argentum et aurum propitii aut irati Dii negaverint dubito</HI>;) and falls at once upon what
he esteems the <HI>principal</HI> of these abuses, <HI>public Corruption.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="49"/>
For having in the last instance, of the <HI>Use of Riches</HI> in Government, spoken of <HI>ve∣nal
Senates,</HI> he goes on to lament the mischief as desperate and remediless; <HI>Gold,</HI>
by its power to corrupt with <HI>Secrecy,</HI> defeating all the efforts of public Spirit, whe∣ther
exerted in the Courage of Heroes, or in the Wisdom of Patriots.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, continues the poet [from ℣ 34 to 51.] the very weight of the
Bribery has sometimes detected the Corruption:
<Q><L><HI>From the crack'd bag the dropping Guinea</HI> spoke<HI>, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
But this inconvenience was soon repaired, by the invention of <HI>Paper credit:</HI> Whose
dreadful effects on public Liberty he describes in all the colouring of his poetry,
heightened by the warmest concern for virtue; which now makes him willing to
give up, as it were, the <HI>previous question,</HI> in a passionate wish [from ℣ 49 to 59.] for
the return of that incumbrance attendant on public Corruption, before the so <HI>common</HI>
use of money.</P>
<P>And pleased with this flattering Idea, he goes on [from ℣ 58 to 77.] to shew the
other advantages that would accrue from <HI>Riches only in kind</HI>; which are, that neither
<HI>Avarice</HI> could contrive to hoard, nor <HI>Prodigality</HI> to lavish, in so mad and boundless a
manner as they do at present. Here he shews particularly, in a fine ironical descri∣ption
of the embarras on <HI>Gaming,</HI> how effectually it would eradicate that execrable
practice.</P>
<P>But this whole <HI>Digression</HI> [from ℣ 34 to 79.] has another very uncommon beauty;
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
for, at the same time that it arises naturally from the <HI>last</HI> consideration in the debate
of the <HI>previous Question,</HI> it artfully denounces, in our entrance on the <HI>main Question,</HI>
the principal topics intended to be employed for the dilucidation of it, namely AVA∣RICE,
PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="52"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 77. <L><HI>Since then, my Lord, on such a World, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus ironically described
the incumbrance which the want of money would occasion to all criminal excesses in
the use of Riches, particularly to <HI>Gaming,</HI> which being now become of public con∣cern,
he affects much regard to:
<Q><L><HI>Oh filthy check to all industrious skill,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To spoil the Nation's last great trade, Quadrille!</HI></L></Q>
he concludes the <HI>previous Question</HI> without deciding it, in the same <HI>ironical</HI> manner,
<Q><L><HI>Since then, my Lord, on such a World we fall,</HI></L>
<L><HI>What say you? Say? Why take it, Gold and all.</HI></L></Q>
That is, since for these great purposes we must have <HI>Money,</HI> let us now <HI>seriously</HI> in∣quire
into its <HI>true Use.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 79. <L><HI>What Riches give us, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> He examines therefore in the <HI>first</HI> place [from
℣ 80 to 99.] I. <HI>Of what Use Riches are to ourselves.</HI><Q><L><HI>What Riches give us let us then enquire?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Meat, Fire, and Cloaths. What more? Meat, Cloaths, and Fire.</HI></L></Q> The mere <HI>turn</HI> of the expression here shews, without further reasoning, that all the
infinite ways of spending <HI>on ourselves,</HI> contrived in the insolence of Wealth, by those
who would <HI>more than live,</HI> are only these <HI>three</HI> things diversified throughout every wea∣ried
mode of Luxury and Wantonness.</P>
<P>Yet as little as this is, adds the poet, [from ℣ 81 to 85.] it is only to be had by the
<HI>moderate use</HI> of Riches; <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profusion</HI> not allowing the possessors of the most
exorbitant wealth even this little:
<Q><L><HI>Alas! 'tis more than</HI> Turner <HI>finds they give.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alas! 'tis more than, all his visions past,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unhappy</HI> Wharton <HI>waking found at last.</HI></L></Q>
But what is it you would expect them to give? continues the poet [from ℣ 84 to 91.]
Would you have them capable of <HI>restoring</HI> those <HI>real</HI> blessings, which men have <HI>lost</HI> by
their <HI>Vices</HI> or their <HI>Villanies</HI>; or of <HI>satisfying</HI> those <HI>imaginary</HI> ones, which they have
<HI>gotten</HI> by their <HI>irregular Appetites</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI>; <HI>these,</HI> sure, the bad or foolish man can∣not
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
have the face to demand; and <HI>those,</HI> by the wise provision of Nature, Riches are
incapable of giving if he had.</P>
<P>But now admit, pursues our author [from ℣ 90 to 97.] that wealth might, in some
cases alleviate the unmerited miseries of life, by procuring medicines both for the mind
and body; yet it is not to be thought it should operate like a charm, while only worn
about one: Yet this, these <HI>poor men of pelf</HI> expect from it, while <HI>Avarice,</HI> on the one
hand, witholds them from giving at all, even to the <HI>Doctor</HI> in extremity; or <HI>Vanity</HI>
diverts the donation from a <HI>Friend</HI> in life, to the Endowment of a <HI>Cat</HI> or <HI>College</HI> at
their death. It is true, <HI>Riches</HI> might give the greatest of all blessings, a <HI>virtuous con∣sciousness</HI>
of our having employ'd them as became the <HI>substitutes of Providence,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>To ease or emulate the care of Heav'n,</HI> <BIBL>℣ 230.</BIBL></L></Q>
in acts of BENEFICENCE and CHARITY; and this <HI>Use</HI> is next to be considered.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 97. <L><HI>To some indeed, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> For now the poet comes, in the Second place, to
examine, II. <HI>Of what use Riches are to others</HI>; which he teaches, as is his way through∣out
this poem, by the <HI>abuse</HI> that stands opposed to it: Thus he shews [from ℣ 96 to
107.] that with regard to acts of <HI>Beneficence,</HI> the utmost Heaven will grant to those
who so greatly abuse its blessings, is either to enrich some favourite <HI>Bastard,</HI> and so
perpetuate their vice and infamy; or else, contrary to their intent, a legitimate <HI>Son
they hated,</HI> and so expose to public scorn and ridicule, the defeat of their unnatural cru∣elty.
But with regard to acts of <HI>Charity,</HI> they are given up to so reprobate a sense,
as to believe they are then seconding the designs of Heaven, when they pursue the
indigent with imprecations, or leave them in the midst of their distresses unrelieved, as
the common enemies of God and Man.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="55"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 107. <L><HI>Yet to be just, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having thus shewn the <HI>true use</HI> of Riches in a
description of the <HI>abuse,</HI> and how that use is perpetually defeated by <HI>Profusion</HI> and
<HI>Avarice,</HI> it was natural to enquire into the spring and original of these vices; as the
<HI>abuse</HI> they occasion, must be well understood, before it can be corrected. The
disposition, therefore, of his subject now calls upon him to come to the <HI>Philo∣sophy</HI>
of it: And he examines particularly into the <HI>Motives</HI> of <HI>Avarice:</HI> But what is
very observable, he, all along, satyrically, intermixes with the <HI>real motives,</HI> several
<HI>imaginary</HI>; and those as wild as imagination could conceive. This, which at first sight
might seem to vitiate the purpose of his <HI>philosophical inquiry,</HI> is found, when duly con∣sidered,
to have the highest art of design. His business, the reader sees, was to prove
that the <HI>real motives</HI> had the highest extravagancy: Nothing could more conduce to
this end, than the setting them by, and comparing them with, the most extravagant
that the fancy itself could invent; in which situation it was seen, that the <HI>real</HI> were
full as wild as the <HI>fictitious.</HI> To give these images all the force they were capable of,
he first describes [from ℣ 118 to 123.] the <HI>real</HI> and a different <HI>imaginary</HI> motive in
<PB N="52" REF="56"/>
the <HI>same person:</HI> and then [from ℣ 122 to 133.] an <HI>imaginary</HI> one, and a <HI>real,</HI> the very
same with the imaginary in <HI>different persons.</HI> This address the poet himself alludes to
℣ 155.
<Q><L><HI>Less mad the wildest whimsy we can frame, &amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Let me observe, that this has still a further beauty, arising from the <HI>nature</HI> of the
poem, which (as we have shewn) is partly <HI>satyrical,</HI> and partly <HI>philosophical.</HI>—With
regard to the <HI>particular</HI> beauties of this disposition, I shall only take notice of one;
where the poet introduces the <HI>fictitious</HI> motive of Blunt's avarice, by a wizard's pro∣phecy:
<Q><L><HI>At length Corruption, like a gen'ral flood</HI></L>
<L><HI>(So long by watchful ministers withstood)</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall deluge all; and</HI> Av'rice <HI>creeping on</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the Sun, &amp;c.</HI></L>
<L><HI>See Britain sunk in lucre's sordid charms,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And France reveng'd on Anne and Edward's arms.</HI></L></Q>
For it was the poet's purpose, in this poem, to shew, that the <HI>main</HI> and <HI>principal abuse</HI>
of Riches arises from AVARICE.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="59"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 151. <L><HI>All this is madness, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now the <HI>Sage,</HI> who has confined himself
to <HI>books,</HI> which prescribe the <HI>government of the passions</HI>; and never looked out upon the
world, where he might see them let loose, and, like Milton's devils, <HI>riding the air in
whirlwind,</HI> cries out, <HI>all this is madness.</HI> True, replies the poet [from ℣ 151 to 177.]
but this madness is a common one, and only to be prevented by a severe attention to
the rule laid down in the <HI>Essay,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Reason still use, to Reason still attend,</HI> <BIBL>Ep. ii. ℣ 68.</BIBL></L></Q>
for with the generality of men, and without the greatest circumspection,
<Q><L><HI>The</HI> ruling Passion<HI>, be it what it will,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The</HI> ruling Passion <HI>conquers Reason still.</HI></L></Q>
But then (continues he) as wild as this passion appears by the sway of its overbearing
bias, it would be still more senseless had it no bias at all. You have seen us here
intermix with the <HI>real,</HI> the most <HI>fantastical</HI> and extravagant that imagination could
form; yet even these are less extravagant than a <HI>ruling Passion without a constant aim.</HI>
Would you know the reason? then listen to this important truth: <Q REND="inline">"'Tis HEAVEN
itself that gives the <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> and thereby directs different men to different
ends: But these being exerted thro' the ministry of NATURE (of whom the great
<HI>Bacon</HI> truly observes, <HI>modum tenere nescia est,</HI> Aug. Scient. l. ii. c. 13.) they are very
apt to run into extremes: To correct which, Heaven, at the same time, added the
moderatrix <HI>Reason</HI>; not to take the <HI>ruling Passion</HI> out of the hands and ministry of
<HI>Nature,</HI> but to restrain and rectify its irregular impulses [See <HI>Essay,</HI> Ep. ii. ℣ 151,
<HI>&amp; seq.</HI>] and what extremes, after this, remained uncorrected in the administration of
<PB N="56" REF="60"/>
this <HI>weak Queen</HI> [℣ 140. Ep. ii.] The divine artist himself has, in his heavenly
skill and bounty set to rights; by so ordering, that these of the <HI>moral,</HI> like those
of the <HI>natural</HI> world, should, even by the very means of their contrariety and di∣versity,
concur to defeat the malignity of one another:
<Q><L><HI>Extremes in</HI> Nature <HI>equal good produce,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Extremes in</HI> Man <HI>concur to gen'ral use.</HI></L></Q>
"For as the various seasons of the year are supported and sustained by the reconciled
extremes of <HI>Wet</HI> and <HI>Dry, Cold</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI>; so all the <HI>orders</HI> and <HI>degrees</HI> of civil
life are kept up, by <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profusion, Selfishness</HI> and <HI>Vanity.</HI> The Miser be∣ing
but the Steward of the Prodigal; and only so much the more backward as the
other is violent and precipitate."<Q><L><HI>This year a Reservoir to keep and spare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The next a Fountain spouting thro' his heir.</HI></L></Q></Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="61"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 179. <L><HI>Old Cotta sham'd his fortune, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The poet now proceeds to support
the principles of his Philosophy by <HI>examples:</HI> But before we come to these, it will be
necessary to look back upon the general ceconomy of the poem.</P>
<P>In the first part [to ℣ 109.] the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>abuse</HI> of Riches are <HI>satyrically</HI> delivered in
<HI>precept.</HI> From thence, to ℣ 177. the causes of the abuse are <HI>philosophically</HI> inquired
into: And from thence to the end, the <HI>use</HI> and <HI>abuse</HI> are <HI>historically</HI> illustrated in <HI>ex∣amples.</HI>
Where we may observe, that the conclusion of the <HI>first</HI> part, concerning the
Miser's cruelty to others, naturally introduces the <HI>second,</HI> by a satyrical apology, shew∣ing
that he is full as cruel to himself: The explanation of which extraordinary phe∣nomenon
brings the author into the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his subject; and this ending in an
observation of Avarice and Profusion's correcting and reconciling one another, as
naturally introduces the <HI>third,</HI> which proves the truth of the observation from <HI>fact.</HI>
And thus the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his <HI>subject</HI> standing between his <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Examples,</HI>
gives strength and light to both, and receives it reflected back again from both.</P>
<P>He first gives us two examples [from ℣ 176 to 219.] of these opposite <HI>ruling Pas∣sions,</HI>
and (to see them in their full force) taken from <HI>subjects,</HI> as he tells us, <HI>not void
of wit or worth</HI>; from such as could <HI>reason</HI> themselves [as we see by ℣ 183, <HI>&amp; seqq.</HI>
and ℣ 205, <HI>&amp; seqq.</HI>] into the whole length of each extreme: For the poet had ob∣served
of the <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> that
<Q><L><HI>Wit, Spirit, Faculties but make it worse;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r.</HI> <BIBL>Essay, Ep. ii. ℣ 136.</BIBL></L></Q>
Old <HI>Cotta</HI> therefore and his <HI>Son</HI> afforded him the most happy illustration of his own
doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="63"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 219. <L><HI>The Sense to value Riches, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Having now largely exposed the
ABUSE of Riches by <HI>example,</HI> not only the <HI>Plan,</HI> but the <HI>Philosophy</HI> of his <HI>Poem,</HI>
required, that he should in the same way, shew the USE likewise: He therefore calls
for an example, in which may be found, against the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> the <HI>Sense to value</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
<HI>Riches</HI>; against the <HI>Vain,</HI> the <HI>Art to enjoy them</HI>; and against the <HI>Avaricious,</HI> the <HI>Vir∣tue
to impart them,</HI> when acquired. This whole Art (he tells us) may be comprized
in one great and general precept, which is this, <Q REND="inline">"That the rich man should con∣sider
himself as the substitute of Providence in this unequal distribution of things;
as the person who is
<Q><L><HI>To ease, or emulate, the care of Heav'n;</HI></L></Q>
To <HI>mend</HI> the faults of fortune, or to <HI>justify</HI> her graces."</Q> And thus the poet slides
naturally into the prosecution of his subject in an <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>true Use</HI> of Riches.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="66"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 249. <L><HI>But all our praises why should Lords engross?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Rise, honest Muse —</HI> ]</L></Q> This invidious expression of the poet's unwillingness that the Nobility should ingross
all his praises, is strongly ironical; their example having been given hitherto only to
shew the <HI>abuse</HI> of Riches. But there is great justness of <HI>Design,</HI> as well as agreeable∣ness
of <HI>Manner</HI> in the preference here given to the <HI>Man of Ross.</HI> The purpose of the
poet is to shew, that an <HI>immense</HI> fortune is not wanted for all the good that Riches are
capable of doing; he therefore chuses such an instance, as proves, that a man with
five hundred pounds a year could become a blessing to a whole country; and, con∣sequently,
that the poet's precepts for the <HI>true use of money,</HI> are of more <HI>general</HI> ser∣vice
than a bad heart will give an indifferent head leave to conceive. This was a truth
of the greatest importance to inculcate: He therefore [from ℣ 249 to 297.] exalts the
character of a <HI>very private</HI> man, one Mr. J. Kyrle, of Herefordshire: And, in end∣ing
his description, struck as it were with admiration at a sublimity of his own crea∣ting,
and warmed with sentiments of a Gratitude he had raised in himself in behalf of
the public, the poet bursts out,
<Q><L><HI>And what? no monument, inscription, stone?</HI></L>
<L><HI>His race, his form, his name almost unknown.</HI></L></Q>
Then, transported with indignation at a contrary object, he exclaims,
<Q><L><HI>When Hopkins dies, a thousand lights attend</HI></L>
<L><HI>The wretch, who living sav'd a candle's end:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Should'ring God's altar a vile image stands,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Belies his features, nay, extends his hands.</HI></L></Q>
I take notice of this description of the portentous vanity of a miserable extortioner,
chiefly for the use we shall now see he makes of it, in carrying on his subject.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="69"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 297. <L><HI>Behold what blessings Wealth to life can lend,</HI></L><L><HI>Now see what comfort it affords our end.</HI>]</L></Q>In the <HI>first</HI> part of this Epistle the author had shewn, from <HI>Reason,</HI> that Riches abused
afford no comfort either in <HI>life</HI> or <HI>death.</HI> In <HI>this</HI> part, where the same truth is taught
by <HI>examples,</HI> he had, in the case of <HI>Cotta</HI> and his son, shewn, that they afford no com∣fort
in <HI>life:</HI> the other member of the division remained to be spoken to,
<Q><L><HI>Now see what Comfort they afford our</HI> end.</L></Q>
And this he illustrates [from ℣ 299 to 339.] in describing the unhappy deaths of the
last Villers, Duke of Buckingham, and Sir J. Cutler; whose profusion and avarice he
has beautifully contrasted. The miserable end of these two extraordinary persons na∣turally
leads the poet into this humane reflexion, however ludicrously expressed,
<Q><L><HI>Say, for such worth, are other worlds prepar'd?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or are they both, in this, their own reward?</HI></L></Q>
And now, as if fully determined to resolve this doubtful question, he assumes the air
<PB N="66" REF="70"/>
and importance of a Professor ready address'd to plunge himself into the very depths of
theology:
<Q><L><HI>A knotty point! to which we now proceed —</HI></L></Q>
when, on a sudden, the whole scene is changed,
<Q><L><HI>But you are tir'd. I'll tell a tale — agreed.</HI></L></Q>
And thus, by the most easy transition, we are come to the <HI>concluding doctrine</HI> of his
poem.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="73"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 339. <L><HI>Where London's column, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> For, the foregoing examples of prosu∣sion
and avarice having been given to shew, that misapplied wealth was <HI>not enjoyed,</HI> it
only remained to prove, that in such circumstances wealth became the <HI>heaviest pu∣nishment</HI>;
and this was the very point to be concluded with, as the great MORAL of
this instructive poem; which is to teach us, <HI>how miserable men make themselves by not
endeavouring to restrain the ruling Passion, tho' it be indeed implanted in the constitution
of things</HI>; while, at the same time it is an answer to the latter part of the question,
<Q><L><HI>Say, for such worth are other world's prepar'd?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or are they both in this their own reward?</HI></L></Q>
For the solution of which only, this example was jocularly pretended to have been given.</P>
<P>All this the poet has admirably supported, in the artful construction of his fable of
Sir Balaam, whose character is so drawn, as to let the reader see he had it in his power
to regulate the <HI>ruling Passion</HI> by reason, as having in himself the seeds of Integrity,
Religion, and Sobriety. These are gradually worked out by an insatiable <HI>thirst of
Wealth</HI>; and this again (thro' a false sense of his own abilities in acquiring it) succeeded
by as immoderate a <HI>Vanity.</HI> Let me only observe farther, that the author, in this <HI>Tale,</HI>
has artfully summed up and recapitulated those three principal mischiefs in the <HI>abuse</HI> of
money, which the <HI>satyrical</HI> part of this poem throughout was employed to expose,
namely, AVARICE, PROFUSION, and PUBLIC CORRUPTION.</P>

<P>VER. 20. JOHN WARD of Hackney
Esq. Member of Parliament, being
secuted by the Duchess of Buckingham,
and convicted of Forgery, was first ex∣pelled
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
the House, and then stood in the
Pillory on the 17th of March 1727. He
was suspected of joining in a conveyance
with Sir John Blunt, to secrete fifty thou∣sand
pounds of that Director's Estate,
forfeited to the South Sea company by
Act of Parliament. The Company re∣covered
the fifty thousand pounds against
Ward; but he set up prior convey∣ances
of his real estate to his brother

of the regiment for a cheat; he was next
banish'd Brussels, and drumm'd out of
Ghent on the same account. After a hun∣dred

to lending of money at exorbitant interest
and on great penalties, accumulating pre∣mium,
interest, and capital into a new
capital, and seizing to a minute when the
payments became due; in a word, by a
constant attention to the vices, wants,
and follies of mankind, he acquired an
immense fortune. His house was a per∣petual

for rapes, and pardoned; but the

Newgate, and large confiscations. He
died in Scotland in 1731, aged 62. The

placed the scene of these shipwrecks in
Cornwall, not only from their frequency
on that coast, but from the inhumanity
of the inhabitants to those to whom that
misfortune arrives: When a ship happens
to be stranded there, they have been
known to bore holes in it, to prevent its
getting off; to plunder, and sometimes
even to massacre the people: Nor has the
the Parliament of England been yet able
wholly to suppress these barbarities.</P>

picture of human nature: In the
entrance on life, all, but coxcombs born,
are usually modest, and esteem the fa∣vours
of their superiors as marks of their
benevolence: But, if these favours hap∣pen
to increase, instead of advancing in
gratitude to our benefactors, we only im∣prove
in the good opinion of ourselves;
and the constant returns of them make
us consider them no longer as accommo∣dations
to our wants, or obligations for
our service, but debts due to our merit:
Yet, at the same time, to do justice to
our nature, let us observe, that this does
not proceed so often from downright vice
as is imagined (when it does, the vice is
bad indeed) but frequently from mere
infirmity; and then too the reason is evi∣dent,
for, having small knowledge of,
and yet excessive fondness for ourselves,
we estimate our merit by the opinion of
others: and this perhaps would not be
much amiss, were we not apt to take
their favours for a declaration of their o∣pinion.
How many, for instance, do we
see in every faculty of the learned pro∣fessions,
who, had they continued in their
primeval meanness, had lived and died
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
as wise even as Socrates himself, that is,
with the <HI>confession of their knowing no∣thing</HI>;
yet, being <HI>push'd up,</HI> as the pro∣per
phrase is, have, in the rapidity of
their course, imagined they saw, at every
new station, a new door of science open∣ing

<HEAD>COMMENTARY.</HEAD>
<P>EPISTLE IV.] The extremes of <HI>Avarice</HI> and <HI>Profusion</HI> being treated of in the fore∣going
Epistle; this takes up one particular branch of the latter, the <HI>Vanity of Expence</HI>
in people of Wealth and Quality; and is therefore a corollary to the preceding. It is
equally remarkable for exactness of method with the rest. But the nature of the sub∣ject,
which is less philosophical, makes it capable of being analysed in a much nar∣rower
compass.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 1. <L><HI>'Tis strange, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The poet's introduction [from ℣ 1 to 39.] consists of
a very curious <HI>remark,</HI> arising from his intimate knowledge of nature, together with
an <HI>illustration</HI> of it, taken from his observations on life. It is this, that the Prodigal
no more <HI>enjoys</HI> his Profusion, than the Miser his Rapacity. It was generally thought,
that <HI>Avarice</HI> only <HI>kept</HI> without enjoyment; but the poet here first acquaints us with
a circumstance in human life much more to be lamented, viz. that <HI>Profusion</HI> too can
<HI>communicate</HI> without it; whereas <HI>Enjoyment</HI> was thought to be as peculiarly the reward
of the <HI>beneficent</HI> passions (of which this seems to have the appearance) as <HI>want</HI> of en∣joyment
was the punishment of the <HI>selfish.</HI>—The phaenomenon observed is odd enough.
But if we look more narrowly into this matter, we shall find, that Prodigality, when
in pursuit of <HI>Taste,</HI> is only a <HI>Mode of Vanity,</HI> and consequently as selfish a passion as even
Avarice itself, and it is of the ordonance and constitution of all selfish passions, when
growing to excess, to defeat their own end, which is <HI>Self-enjoyment.</HI> But besides the
accurate philosophy of this observation, there is a fine <HI>Morality</HI> contained in it; namely
that <HI>ill-got</HI> Wealth is not only as unreasonably, but as <HI>uncomfortably</HI> squandered as it
was raked together; which the poet himself further insinuates in ℣ 15.
<Q><L><HI>What brought Sir Visto's</HI> ill-got wealth <HI>to waste —</HI></L></Q>
He then illustrates this observation by divers examples in every branch of <HI>wrong Taste</HI>;
and to set their absurdities in the strongest light, he, in conclusion, contrasts them
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
with several instances of the <HI>true,</HI> in the noble Lord to whom the Epistle is addressed.
This disposition is productive of various beauties: for, by this means, the <HI>Introduction</HI>
becomes an <HI>epitome</HI> of the body of the Epistle; which, as we shall see, consists of ge∣neral
reflections on <HI>Taste,</HI> and particular examples of <HI>bad</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> And his
friend's Example concluding the Introduction, leads the poet gracefully into the sub∣ject
itself; for this Lord, here celebrated for his good Taste, was now at hand
to deliver the first and fundamental percept of it himself, which gives authority
and dignity to all that follow.</P>

<P>The first part of it, [from ℣ 38 to 95.] delivers rules for attaining to the MAGNI∣FICENT
in just expence; which is the same in Building and Planting, that the SUB∣LIME
is in Painting and Poetry; and, consequently, the qualities necessary for the
attainment of both must have the same relation.</P>
<P>1. The first and <HI>fundamental,</HI> he shews [from ℣ 38 to 47.] to be SENSE.<Q><L>Good Sense<HI>, which only is the gift of Heav'n,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And, tho' no Science, fairly worth the Seven.</HI></L></Q> And for <HI>that</HI> reason; not only as it is the foundation and parent of them all, and the
constant regulator and director of their operations, or, as the poet better expresses it,
<HI>— of every Art the Soul</HI>; but likewise as it alone can, in case of need, very often
supply the offices of every one of them.</P>

previous ev'n to Taste — 'tis Sense</HI>; and this, in the order of things: For <HI>Sense</HI> is a taste
and true conception of <HI>Nature</HI>; and <HI>Taste</HI> is a sense or true conception of <HI>beautiful
Nature</HI>; but we must first know the <HI>Essences</HI> of things, before we can judge truly of
their <HI>Qualities.</HI> The business of <HI>Taste,</HI> therefore, in the pursuit of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> is,
as the poet shews us [from ℣ 46 to 65.] 1. [to ℣ 51.] to catch or lay hold on <HI>Nature,</HI>
where she appears most in her charms. 2. [to ℣ 57.] To adorn her, when taken, as
best suits her dignity and quality; that is, to dress her in the light and modest habit of
a virgin, not load her with the gaudy ornaments of a prostitute. This rule observed,
will prevent a transgression in the following, which is, not to let all its beauties be
seen at once, but in succession; for that advantage is inseparable from a graceful and
well-dressed person. 3. [to ℣ 65.] To take care that the ornaments be well suited to
<HI>that part,</HI> which it is your purpose to adorn; and, as in dressing out a <HI>modest Fair,</HI>
(which is the poet's own comparision) the colours are proportioned to her complexion;
the stuff, to the embonpoint of her person; and the fashion, to her air and shape;
so in ornamenting a villa, <HI>the rise or fall of waters</HI> should correspond to its acclivities
or declivities; the <HI>artificial hills or vales</HI> to its cover or exposure; and the manner of
<HI>calling in the country</HI> to the disposition of its aspect. But again, as in the illustra∣tion,
whatever be the variety in colour, stuff, or fashion, they must still be so suited
with respect to one another, as to produce an agreement and harmony in their assem∣blage;
so woods, waters, mountains, vales, and vistas must, amidst all their diversity,
be so disposed with a relation to each other, as to create a perfect symmetry resulting
<PB N="81" REF="85"/>
from the whole; and this, the <HI>Genius</HI> of the place, when religiously consulted, will
never fail to inform us of; who, as the poet says,
<Q><L><HI>Now breaks, and now directs th' intending lines,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Paints as you plant, and, as you work, designs.</HI></L></Q>
And this is a full and complete description of the <HI>office of Taste.</HI></P>

our fondness for the elegances of our new mistress, oftentimes occasions us to neglect
the plainness and simplicity of the old; we are but too apt to forsake our Guide, and to
give ourselves up solely to <HI>Taste.</HI> Our author's next rule therefore 3. is, <HI>still to follow
Sense,</HI> and let it perpetually accompany us thro' all the works of <HI>Taste.</HI><Q><L><HI>Still follow Sense, of ev'ry art the</HI> Soul.</L></Q>
That is, <HI>Good Sense</HI> should never be a moment absent from the works of <HI>Taste,</HI> any more
than the Soul from the Body; for just as the Soul animates and informs every air and
feature of a beauteous body, so <HI>Sense</HI> gives life and vigour to all the products of <HI>Taste.</HI></P>

<PB N="83" REF="87"/>
Sense with Taste he then explains [from this verse to 71.] 1. That the beautiful parts
which <HI>Taste</HI> has laid out and contrived, <HI>Sense</HI> makes to answer one another, and to <HI>slide</HI>
naturally, without violence, <HI>into a whole.</HI> 2. That many beauties will <HI>spontaneously offer</HI>
themselves, suggested from the very necessity which <HI>Sense</HI> lays upon us, of conforming
the parts to the whole, that no original invention of <HI>Taste</HI> would have supplied. 3. A
third advantage is, that you are then always sure to have <HI>Nature on your side,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Nature shall join you —</HI></L></Q>
The expression is important — <HI>Sense</HI> being a right conception of <HI>Nature</HI>; and <HI>Taste</HI> a
right conception of <HI>beautiful Nature</HI>; when these are in conjunction, Nature can
stand out no longer, but presents herself to you without further pains or search.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 71. <L><HI>Without it, proud Versailles, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> To illustrate this doctrine, the poet
next shews us [from ℣ 70 to 99.] that without this continued support of <HI>Good Sense,</HI>
things even of the <HI>highest Taste</HI> and <HI>utmost Magnificence,</HI> such as the Buildings of <HI>Ver∣sailles,</HI>
the Gardens of <HI>Villario,</HI> and the Groves of <HI>Sabinus</HI> (which are the instances
he gives) all, in a very little time, come to nothing. — And no wonder. For the
exercise of <HI>Taste</HI> WITHOUT SENSE is, where something that is <HI>not beautiful Nature</HI> is
<PB N="84" REF="88"/>
mistaken for it, and <HI>ornamented</HI> as beautiful Nature should be: These ornaments, there
fore, being destitute of all real support, must be continually subject to change. Some∣times
the owner himself will grow weary of them (as in the case of <HI>Villario</HI>) and find
at last, that <HI>Nature</HI> is to be preferred before them,
<Q><L><HI>Tir'd of the scene</HI> Parterres <HI>and</HI> Fountains <HI>yield,</HI></L>
<L><HI>He finds at last he better likes a</HI> Field.</L></Q>
Sometimes, again, the Heir (like <HI>Sabinus</HI>'s) will be changing a bad Taste for a worse,
<Q><L><HI>One</HI> boundless green<HI>, or</HI> flourish'd carpet <HI>views,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With all the</HI> mournful family <HI>of yews.</HI></L></Q>
So that <HI>mere Taste</HI> standing exposed between the true and <HI>false,</HI> like the decent man,
between the rigidly virtuous, and thoroughly profligate, hated and despised by both,
can never long support itself; and with this the <HI>first part</HI> of the Epistle concludes.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 99. <L><HI>At Timon's Villa, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> As the first part ended with exposing the works
of <HI>Taste without Sense,</HI> the second begins with a description [from ℣ 98 to 173.] of
<HI>false Magnificence</HI> WITHOUT EITHER SENSE OR TASTE, in the gardens, buildings,

table-furniture, library, and way of living of Lord <HI>Timon</HI>; who, in none of these,

<HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>fastus,</HI> or between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>pedantry.</HI> But what then? says the poet,
here resuming the great <HI>principle of his Philosophy</HI> (which these moral Epistles were
wrote to illustrate, and consequently on which they are all regulated) tho'
<Q><L><HI>Heav'n visits with a Taste the wealthy Fool,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And needs no</HI> Rod —</L></Q>
Yet the punishment is confined as it ought, and the evil is turned to the benefit of
<HI>others:</HI> For
<Q><L><HI>— hence the poor are cloath'd, the hungry fed;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Health to himself, and to his infants bread,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The lab'rer bears; what his</HI> hard heart <HI>denies</HI></L>
<L><HI>His</HI> charitable vanity <HI>supplies.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="96"/>
<Q REND="inline">VER. 173. <L><HI>Another age, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> But now a difficulty sticks with me, answers an ob∣jector,
this load of evil still remains a monument of folly to future ages; an incum∣brance
to the plain on which it stands, and a nuisance to the neigbourhood around, as
filling it
<Q><L><HI>— with imitating fools.</HI></L></Q>
For men are apt to take the example next at hand; and aptest of all to take a bad one.
No fear of that, replies the poet [from ℣ 172 to 177.] Nothing absurd or wrong
is exempt from the jurisdiction of Time, which is always sure to do full justice on it,
<Q><L><HI>Another age shall see the golden Ear</HI></L>
<L><HI>Imbrown the Slope, and nod on the Parterre,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Deep Harvests bury all his pride has plan'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And laughing Ceres reassume the land.</HI></L></Q>
For the prerogative of
<Q><L><HI>— Time shall make it grow,</HI></L></Q>
is only due to the designs of <HI>true Taste</HI> joined to <HI>Use:</HI> And

<Q><PB N="93" REF="97"/><L><HI>'Tis</HI> Use <HI>alone that</HI> sanctifies <HI>Expence;</HI></L></Q>
and nothing but the sanctity of <HI>that</HI> can arrest the justice of Time. And thus the
second part concludes; which consisting of an <HI>example of false</HI> Taste in every attempt
to Magnificence, is full of concealed <HI>precepts</HI> for the <HI>true:</HI> As the first part, which
contains <HI>precepts</HI> for <HI>true</HI> Taste, is full of <HI>examples</HI> of the <HI>false.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VER. 177. <L><HI>Who then shall grace, &amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> We come now to the third and last part;
[from ℣ 176 to the end] and, as in the first, the poet had given examples of wrong-judged
<HI>Magnificence,</HI> in things of <HI>Taste without Sense</HI>; and in the second, an example
of others <HI>without either Sense or Taste</HI>; so the third is employed in two illustrious ex∣amples
of <HI>Magnificence</HI> in <HI>Planting and Building,</HI> where <HI>both Sense and Taste</HI> highly
prevail: The one in him, to whom this Epistle is addressed; and the other, in the
Noble person whose excellent Character bore so conspicuous a part in the foregoing.<Q><L><HI>Who then shall grace? or who improve the Soil?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who plants like</HI> BATHURST<HI>, or who builds like</HI> BOYLE.</L></Q> Where, in the fine description he gives of these two species of <HI>Magnificence,</HI> he art∣fully
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>
insinuates, that tho' when executed in a <HI>true Taste,</HI> the great end and aim of
both be the same, viz. the <HI>general</HI> good, in use or ornament; yet that their progress
to this end is carried on in direct contrary courses; that in <HI>Planting</HI> the private ad∣vantage
of the neighbourhood is first promoted, till, by time, it rises up to a public
benefit:
<Q><L><HI>Whose ample Lawns are not asham'd to feed</HI></L>
<L><HI>The milky heifer, and deserving steed;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whose rising Forests, not for pride or show,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But future Buildings, future Navies grow.</HI></L></Q>
On the contrary, the wonders of Architecture ought first to be bestowed on the public:
<Q><L><HI>Bid Harbours open, public ways extend;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bid Temples, worthier of the God, ascend;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous flood contain;</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Mole projected break the roaring main.</HI></L></Q>
And when the public has been properly strengthened and adorned, then, and not till
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
then, the works of private <HI>Magnificence</HI> may take place. This was the order observ'd
by those two great Empires, from whom we received all we have of this polite art:
We read not of any the least Magnificence in the private buildings of Greece or Rome,
till the grandeur of their public spirit had adorned the State with Temples, Empori∣ums,
Council-houses, Common-Porticos, Baths, and Theatres.</P>

and in the happy improvement of it by <HI>time.</HI>
To understand what is meant by <HI>supporting</HI>
(which is a term of art common both to
<HI>Planting</HI> and <HI>Painting</HI>) we must consider
what things make the natural defect or
weakness of a rude uncultivated <HI>Plain</HI>; and
these are, the having a disagreable flat∣ness,
and the not having a <HI>proper termi∣nation.</HI>
But a <HI>Wood,</HI> rightly disposed, takes
away the one, and gives what is wanting
of the other.<Q><L><HI>— The parts unite.</HI></L></Q> The utmost which art can do, when it does
its full office, is to give the work a <HI>consent</HI>
of parts; but it is <HI>time</HI> only that can
make the <HI>union</HI> here spoken of, there
being the same difference between these,
as between a simple <HI>Contract,</HI> and a <HI>Con∣summation.</HI>
So in painting, the skill
of the <HI>master</HI> can go no further, in the
chromatic part, than to set those colours
together, which have a natural friendship
and sympathy for each other: But no∣thing
but <HI>time</HI> can unite and incorporate
their tints.<Q><L><HI>And strength of Shade contends with
strength of Light.</HI></L></Q> And now the work becomes a <HI>very</HI> pi∣cture;
which the poet informs us of, in
the sublime way of poetical instruction,
by setting that picture before our eyes;
and not merely a picture, but a <HI>perfect</HI>
one, in which the lights and shades, not
only bear a <HI>proportion</HI> to one another
in their force (which is implied in the
word <HI>contends</HI>) but are both at their
<HI>height</HI> (which the word <HI>strength</HI> signifies.)
As the use of the singular number in the
terms <HI>Shade</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> alludes to ano∣ther
precept of the art, that not only the
shades and lights should be great and broad,
but that the masses of the clair-obscure, in
a groupe of objects, should be so ma∣naged,
by a subordination of the groups
to the unity of design, as that the whole
together may afford one great <HI>shade</HI> and
<HI>light.</HI></P>

not only to be very absurd, but very <HI>odi∣ous</HI>
too; and has a peculiar beauty, as, in
one instance of false Taste, viz. <HI>an inju∣dicious
choice in imitation,</HI> he gives (in the
epithet employ'd) the suggestion of ano∣ther,
which is an <HI>injudicious manner of
it.</HI> For those disagreeable objects which,
when <HI>painted,</HI> give pleasure; if <HI>colour∣ed</HI>
after nature, in <HI>relief,</HI> become shock∣ing,
as a toad, or dead carcase in wax∣work:
yet these things are the de∣light
of all people of bad Taste. How∣ever,
the Ornament itself pretends to
science, and would justify its use by
antiquity, tho' it betrays the most miser∣able
ignorance of it. The <HI>Serpent,</HI> a∣mongst
the ancients, was sacred, and full
of venerable mysteries. Now things do
not excite ideas so much according to their
own natural impressions, as by fictitious
ones, arising from foreign and accidental
<PB N="91" REF="95"/>
combinations; consequently the view of
this animal raised in them nothing of that
abhorrence which it is wont to do in us;
but, on the contrary, very agreeable sen∣sations,
correspondent to those foreign as∣sociations.
Hence, and more especially
because the Serpent was the peculiar <HI>Sym∣bol
of health,</HI> it became an extreme pro∣per
ornament to the <HI>genial rooms</HI> of the
ancients: While we, who are strangers to
all this superstition, yet make ourselves
liable to one much more absurd, which is,
idolizing the very <HI>fashions</HI> that arose from
it. But if these pretenders to Taste can
so widely mistake, it is no wonder that
those who pretend to none, I mean the
verbal Critics, should a little <HI>hallucinate</HI>
in this matter. I remember, when the
short Latin inscription on Shakespear's
monument was first set up, and in the
very style of elegant and simple anti∣quity,
the News-papers were full of these
small Critics; in which, the only obser∣vation
that looked like learning, was
founded in this ignorance of Taste and
Antiquity. One of these Critics objected
to the word <HI>Mors</HI> (in the inscription)
because the Roman writers of the pu∣rest
times scrupled to employ it; but,
in its stead, used an improper, that is, a
figurative word, or otherwise a circumlo∣cution.
But had he consider'd that it was
their Superstition of <HI>lucky</HI> and <HI>unlucky words</HI>
which occasion'd this delicacy, he must
have seen that a Christian writer, in a Chri∣stian
inscription, acted with great judgment
in avoiding so senseless an affectation of,
what he miscalls, classical expression.</P>

Here the poet, to make the <HI>examples</HI> of
<HI>good Taste</HI> the better understood, intro∣duces
them with a summary of his <HI>Pre∣cepts</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="98"/>

and the making <HI>Splendor</HI> or <HI>Taste borrow
all its rays</HI> from thence, is <HI>going on with
Sense,</HI> after she has led us up to <HI>Taste.</HI>
The art of this can never be sufficiently
admired. But the Expression is equal to
the Thought. This <HI>sanctifying</HI> of expence
gives us the idea of something consecrated
and set apart for sacred uses; and indeed,
it is the idea under which it may be pro∣perly
considered: For wealth employed
<PB N="95" REF="99"/>
according to the <HI>intention</HI> of the great

year 1732, when some of the new-built
Churches, by the Act of Queen Anne,
were ready to fall, being sounded in
boggy land (which is satyrically alluded
to in our author's imitation of Horace
lib. ii. Sat. 2.

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Dagenham-breach had done
very great mischiefs; many of the High∣ways
throughout England were hardly
passable, and most of those which were
repaired by Turnpikes were made jobs
for private lucre, and infamously execu∣ted,
even to the entrances of London it∣self:
The proposal of building a Bridge
at Westminster had been petition'd against
and rejected; but in two years after the
publication of this poem, an Act for
building a Bridge past thro' both houses.
After many debates in the committee, the
execution was left to the carpenter above∣mentioned,
who would have made it a
wooden one; to which our author alludes
in these lines,
<Q><L><HI>Who builds a Bridge that never drove a
