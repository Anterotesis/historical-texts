<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ERE there not always a diffe∣rence between real Grievances and Party Quarrels; if a just Di∣stinction were not to be made, be∣tween the Complaints of a Nation, and the Clamours of a Prejudic'd Party, this Tract had not been publish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Again, if there were not an evident dif∣ference between a Thirst of <HI>Blood,</HI> and a Demand of <HI>Justice,</HI> between Party Venge∣ance, and Legal Prosecutions, this Pen, which has never yet been drawn in any of these Publick Quarrels, had not now been Employ'd.</P>
<P>Yet again; If there were not Allowances needful to be made, for the Characters of the Persons who Complain; and a diffe∣rence between the just Complaints of Men, whose Principles, Morals, and Vertues gave them some Weight in the World, and the Rudeness of Profligates and Bullies: If there were not Distinctions to be made, between Conscientious Pious Patriots, known to be Lovers of their Country, and Zealous for the Liberties and Priviledges of their Posterity, and a vitious abandon'd Crew; Bloody in Principle, forsaken of all commendable Vertue, swallow'd up in Re∣venge, and the Prejudices of their Parties; swelling in <HI>Envy, Hatred, Malice, and all Uncharitableness</HI>; Raging for the Blood of those who they Hate, and like some of their Fathers, calling for <HI>Justice, Justice!</HI> that they might draw the People into the worst sort of Murder: If, I say, these Things had not been in the Case before me, I, who never engag'd in this manner before, would not have undertaken this Task.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
But if these Men pass unreprov'd, then all manner of Villanies must be Tolerated among us, from the Authority of Bullies and Incendiaries; and whoever these Peo∣ple please to prescribe, (as in the <HI>Triumvi∣rate</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI>) shall come to be Sacrificed, under the Pretence of <HI>Justice.</HI> The Cry is for <HI>Justice</HI>; it is directed to the Govern∣ment. The Government would do wisely, if they thought fit to do Justice on these Men, who have the Face to tell them who must be put to Death by them; and that the People expect it, that is to say, a <HI>Party</HI> expect it, to please and gratifie their Re∣venge: If Justice may not be obtained a∣gainst such Insolence, then each Hackney Writer shall lead the Ministry, nay, even the King himself, to Cruelty and Blood, to make good the Resentment of an Enraged Faction, and to obey the Commands of a daring <HI>Dissenting Preacher,</HI> and a detesta∣ble exasperated B....: To begin with the first of these, <HI>viz. T. Br<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y,</HI> the Dissent∣ing Preacher.</P>
<P>How great the Rage of this Man is, and how it transports him, even beyond the Bounds of Modesty, Duty, and Justice, will be best illustrated, by Reflection upon the late Injunctions published by his Majesty's special Command, Directing the Clergy to
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<HI>Restrain themselves within the Limits of their Duty, and not to intermeddle ni their Sermons with Affairs of State</HI>: It should seem, this Man esteemeth himself as no Minister, and so that he is not spoken to in these Injunctions; or that the King's Injunctions are of such a private Interpretation, that they should imply a Restraint to the Church Clergy only, and an Allowance to all others to preach <HI>Sedition</HI>; Or otherwise, this Man must let the King know, That the <HI>Dissenting Preachers</HI> do not think themselves under his Authority, or within the Power of any of his Restraints, so as to be liable to his Injunctions.</P>
<P>It will be to the Purpose many Ways, to consider the Insolence of this Man, in his late manner of Preaching, and what Views he must have in his behaving thus; as also the unhappy Condition of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the State her Clergy are reduced to, and the Injustice of Suffering the <HI>Dissent∣ing Preachers</HI> thus to trample under their Feet, the Ministers of that Church, by whom they are indulged in the Liberties they shew themselves so unworthy to enjoy</P>
<P>The due Examination of these Particulars may, it is hoped, open the Eyes of those who at present seem so willing to Reduc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Church to Extremities; nay, it may perhaps, cause even the more Moderat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
among the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> to awake, and to con∣sider whether such Behaviour becomes their Ministers or Preachers, whether it is their true Interest to act in this Manner, and whether a Time may not come (if the Church may ever recover from this Mis∣chievous Usage) when She may do Her self Justice.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledg'd, that the Church of <HI>England will be in Danger,</HI> if Her Clergy must have their Mouths seal'd up; and while they obey the Royal Injunctions, publish'd by his Majesty's Command, not to intermeddle with State-Matters in their Sermons, the Dissenting Preachers, as not Concern'd in that Command, (and as if by being not named in those Injunctions, they had thereby an Indulgence for the Purpose,) take the Liberty to condemn to Death those who they please to prescribe, and to call the People together, to cry for <HI>Blood, Blood,</HI> under the old Cant of (41) <HI>Justice, Justice:</HI> What Height of unparallel'd Insolence has been shewn in this Part by <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y,</HI> and some others by <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t,</HI> not to be parallel'd indeed but by one another, in Two Pam∣phlets publish'd the last Week; the one, <HI>A Letter to my Lord H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>x</HI>; and the other, <HI>A Sermon on the late Thansgiving</HI>: Both call∣ing on the Government for <HI>Blood</HI>; both leading the King and Ministry to <HI>Blood</HI>;

which in these Men is Murther, whateve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it must be in the other. The Circumstance of both of these, render the Crime flagrant and the Criminals odious.</P>
<P>Preachers, one would think, ought no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be Prompters of Blood and Revenge▪ more espeecially those, who a few Year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> past, spoke so much for Moderation, For¦bearance, Charity, and what not; yet thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> young Gentleman has given the World <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Taste of the Justice which these Men <HI>do</HI> as well as of the Justice which they <HI>seek</HI>▪ With what Front durst this Incendiary en¦ter upon the Subject, when he knew Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty had but even then strictly forbid¦den the Clergy to meddle in their Pulpit with such Matters? Can he have the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Manners to say, That His Majesty design'd that the Mouths of the Clergy of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church of <HI>England</HI> should be stopped, and the Mouths of Schismaticks and Dissenter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be open'd? What Satyr would thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been on the Person and Conduct o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King? And how would it have open'd the Mouths of the People against such par¦tial Usage of the Church? Who shall say the Church is not <HI>in Danger,</HI> even in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> utmost Danger, if this be Her Case? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the other side, he will say, he does not un¦derstand the <HI>Injunctions</HI> to be a prescribing the Clergy of the Church, and leaving
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
the other Preachers of all the Sects free, Then with what Front durst this Man disobey His Majesty's Injunctions, and taking upon him to lead the King and his Ministry to what they ought, or ought not to do, to summon the People to call for Justice, which, as aforesaid, is Blood, and insinuate who are the Men they should clamour against, which manifestly is practi∣sing Sedition and Murder?</P>
<P>I am unacquainted with the Sects of Dissenters, yet I have often heard, that they have vindicated themselves, or endeavour'd to do so frequently, against the Charge often brought upon them, of being regard∣less of Kings and Governments, practising Sedition, and such Things as these. Those among them who are sober and modest, must abhor this Man and his Preaching, seeing the King, from a Principle of Peace∣ableness, as we would hope, and to keep the People Quiet, has forbid, by the Injunctions publish'd in the Publick <HI>Gazette,</HI> the Mini∣sters of the Church to meddle with these Things. This <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y</HI> surely ought to have esteemed himself equally restrained by those Injunctions, otherwise he must expose the Justice of the King in the highest Manner. If he has the Front to do this, let him bring in his Plea; let him say the King allow'd Dissenting Preachers
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
to meddle with State-Affairs in their Pul¦pits, while he denied the Church of <HI>Eng¦land</HI> Ministers the same Liberty; and say¦ing and proving this, will state the Condi¦tion of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in a few Words, and put it out of Question for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> future, whether She is in Danger, yea or no▪ This Incendiary is unable to deny, but tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is expresly forbidden by the Injunction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to preach in this Manner, as much as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Church Clergy; I have a better Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Cunning, than to suppose otherwise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him; nay, should he flie to that weak and foolish Pretence (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Injunction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are directed to the Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy only, it would fail him, seeing the very Words of the Injunctions will convict him.

Regard to King <HI>George?</HI> After all the ful∣some Parasitical Stuff he has been so long venting about the King, which is, to honest Men, odious, and to the King Himself con∣temptible. Is this his observing the Legal Injunctions, (as one of his Class calls them) of the King upon the Clergy?</P>
<P>Now should we call upon the Ministry to do Justice upon this Incendiary, and im∣plore his Majesty, in his Justice to the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and in Vindication of his own Injunctions, to let this Offender be brought to condign Punish∣ment: This I perswade my self his Maje∣sty will not deny, or, that on the other hand, His Royal Justice will move him to take off those Injunctions from the Clergy of the Church, which they now lye under; the Restraints whereof, they have, with Defe∣rence to His Majesty, strictly conformed to. What just Complaints may the Clergy make of being hardly and unjustly dealt with, if such a manifest Breach of His Majesty's Commands shall not be resented? Is it not expressed in the said Injunctions, that the Breach thereof will incur his Royal Displeasure, and that the King will give Charge to the Judges, and all their Civil Officers, to do their Duty towards prevent∣ing and punishing such as shall offend herein? And is it the Misfortune of the Church-Clergy
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
only, to be capable of incurring his Majesty's Displeasure; and the Dissenting Preachers, who, notwithstanding they are only admitted, or suffer'd to Preach, by a kind Exemption, from the Punishment due by the Law, to Schismaticks and Recusants, may, without Offence, take that very Li∣berty which the others are forbidden? What a desolate, abandon'd Condition is the Church of <HI>England</HI> brought to, if this be her Fate? And where may we suppose this will end?</P>
<P>But I will not perswade any true Church∣man to entertain a Thought so prejudicial to the Honour of the King; neither will I presume to suggest, that the King can hear such Things (if ever His Majesty shall have Opportunity to hear them,) without the utmost Resentment.</P>
<P>Unhappy is the State of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if such Things can be practis'd in this Kingdom, and not one of Her Mem∣bers be so faithful to Her Interest, as to give a true impartial Account of this Mat∣ter, to Her Head and Sworn Defender: But there is no room to doubt but some will be found, who will lay these Things before the King, and will inform His Maje∣sty who they are, that inflame and despise His Subjects, by bitter Invectives in their Sermons, and by scurrilous Language in
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
their Pulpits, notwithstanding His In∣junction to the contrary; which, if done wisely, and with Clearness, will soon con∣vince His Majesty who they are that are the Cause of the present Dissatisfaction of his Subjects, and who they are that desire he may be the Peaceable and Gracious So∣vereign Lord over all his People. It can scarce be believ'd, that these Men should make any Impression on His Majesty, by this way of Preaching and Printing; but surely a faithful Account given to him of this Behaviour, in Defiance of his Injunction, must make Impression on his Mind, very much to their Prejudice, and no less to the Advantage of the publick Peace, both in Church and State. Mean time, those who think that this Management of him∣self is becoming either the Person of this <HI>Bradbury,</HI> who calls himself a Minister, or his Friends, the Dissenters, <HI>quatenus</HI> Dissen∣ter, and tolerated by the Church, may en∣courage him to proceed as he has begun; but a Time may come, when they may see themselves mistaken, and may find they un∣seasonably discover'd the bloody Disposition to be so much their own: There are many among the Dissenters, who are sensible of it already, and are only wanting, in that they do not think fit to do themselves the Justice to declare their Minds, which is
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
their Fear of the People, and lest they should be cast out of the Synagogue, <HI>Loving the Praise of Men more,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From this Preaching Incendiary, I pro∣ceed to the Lay-Preacher <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t,</HI> who takes upon him, after a Series of Lewdness and Debauchery, in his former Life, to set up for an Instructor of Ministry, and im∣pudently tells the Ministers of State, the King's Majesty, and all, that he expects the last Ministry should be sacrific'd to his Resentments, and their Heads be given to him in a Charger, as that Lewd Dancer did to <HI>John</HI> the Baptist.</P>
<P>Were this Demand made by a less fla∣grant Villain, one that had not been the Shame, as well as Grief of his Father; the Scandal of his Family, and the Contempt of Men of Honour; or had it been by one who had not sent his Right Reverend Fa∣ther to Her late Majesty, to beg Mercy for him, and to entreat Her Majesty that a Just Prosecution might be stop'd, which was issued against him, for insulting Her Royal Person and Government, which Ap∣plication, the very same Persons, whose Bloods he now thirsts after, were earnest Suiters to the Queen to accept, and promp∣ted Her Native Clemency to Pardon a Man whom his own Father had nothing to say for, but meerly to ask it of her Grace and Good∣ness,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
the same Grace and Goodness which led Her to spare many more, who now stamp upon Her Memory, with the great∣est Ingratitude and Contempt. Was this Demand, I say, made by one who had not thus been in Debt to the Men he would destroy, some Room would have been left to believe, there might have been some∣thing of a Publick Spirited Zeal in the Mo∣tion, however extravagant in itself, and however it might be carried beyond the Bounds of Christianity and Honour.</P>
<P>But, when a Man is put into a Rage by Envy, and in the height of a Party Distra∣ction, calls out for Blood, and demands the Heads of such as he and his Fellow Furies have thought fit to prescribe, it is Time then to let the World know the Meaning of these Things, and what is to be said, or done in the Case.</P>
<P>The Actions of every <HI>English</HI> Man are to be enquir'd into by Legal Process; heard in due Form, and judg'd by the proper Persons. It is Criminal for any One to tamper with the Juries, who are to pass upon any Man in Cases of Life and Death; to offer to Bribe, or Pre-possess them ei∣ther to Acquit or Condemn; it is not there∣fore allowed for any Man to enter upon his own Vindication in Publick, while his Case is depending in any Court of Justice,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
because it is anticipating his Tryal, and a pre-possessing the People out of whom his Jury is to be Chosen, and consequently pre-possessing and tampering with the Ju∣ry itself, in like manner, ought not to be allowed: That Men who are liable to be question'd, in Publick, for any Actions which they may have done, which are sup∣posed to be Illegal, should be arraigned be∣fore Hand in Publick, by every Lewd Scribler, who, in this respect, pre-possesses the World against them as much as in him lies; find him Guilty before he is Tryed, and Execute him as it were in Effigie: When such Methods are made use of to make Men publickly Obnoxious, it is a plain over awing those, who may come to pass upon these Men for Life or Death, who are made afraid to do Justice, least they are mark'd out for the same popular Hatred. What, but this, is the real De∣sign of these Men? They are for pre-pos∣sessing the whole Nation with such Noti∣ons of the Guilt of the last Ministry, That whosoever shall not find them Guilty when Impeach'd, or shall not be forward to Im∣peach them, shall be in danger of having his House pull'd down by the Rabble, and of being set upon, in the Streets, on every Tumultuous Occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
The Question before these Men, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to do Justice, whatever the specious watch Word is at this Time; They must have the Blood of the Men they have mark'd out; and if those, who are to be Judges, should not find every Man whom they Ac∣cuse Guilty, they will be equally unsatisfied as they are now; they tell the Ministers of State now, that <HI>they expect</HI> the late Mini∣stry shall be Impeach'd; when that is done, they will, with the same imperious Tone, tell the House of Lords, they expect they should be <HI>found Guilty</HI>; and to give a seeming Weight to their Insolence, every Scribler now has learnt of <HI>St<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l</HI> to speak High, and say the Nation <HI>expects it</HI>; than which, nothing is more false, for the Kingdom <HI>expects</HI> a healing of our Breaches, not a widening them; a Just, Moderate and Clement Government; not using Pow∣er to Oppression; not gratifying Party Rage, and setting one half the People to devour the other.</P>
<P>The Ignorant young Man, now speaking of, has but one Thing in the whole Pamph∣let, which he has Publish'd, that has Weight in it; and this is, That he says, <HI>All the Executors of a Sovereign's Illegal Orders, from a Plenipotentiary, down to a Constable, are an∣swerable for their Execution of them.</HI> This, I say, is all that has Weight in his Book,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
and this is what every Old Woman in Po∣liticks knows, and could have said as well as he. The Men he Rails at, and in his rough Language Abuses, join Issue with the whole Party upon this Foot, and then Challenge him, and all his Brotherhood, of the Blood-hound Pack, for they are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better, to shew one illegal Order of Her Majesties which they have executed.</P>
<P>After all that this scurrilous mad Crea∣ture has said, to provoke his Readers to the same height with himself, one would have thought he should have given an Instance of, at least, one Illegal Order issued by Her Majesty, and executed by Her Ministry, upon which they are to <HI>expect</HI> their Heads; and I search'd narrowly for it, but could not find the least appearance thereof, which justifies fully the Liberty I take with these Two Scriblers, in saying, it is not Justice, but Blood which they hunt after; and least they should fail of obtaining the Heads of these Men, by the Course of a Just Prose∣cution, they are thus raising a Flame in the Minds of the People against them, That, if possible, they may Awe the World, not only into the Impeachment, but into the Verdict; and may signifie, that whoe∣ver shall dissent, shall be mark'd by the People to be sacrific'd by them upon the first Occasion. What is this but <HI>Blood,</HI> as
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
in my Title? And, how can the Govern∣ment bear this, without shewing a just Re∣sentment, or making Men fear that they are in worse Circumstances, than, it is hoped, they ever will be.</P>
<P>I know that there is a Design in these Men, that looks another way; and some of them have had Weakness enough to be∣wray the Folly, <HI>viz.</HI> They hope by this popular Rage to intimidate the Persons they threaten, and filling them with ap∣prehensions of not obtaining a fair and just Tryal, oblige them to absent themselves, and reserve their Defence for better Times. It is true, had the Persons Concern'd no∣thing to expect, but what these envenom'd Spirits would do; had they not a firm and fix'd Assurance that they can neither prove the Charge, nor influence the House of Peers to condemn Men without Guilt, and without fair Hearing; were it not for this, it must be confess'd, it would be a Mad∣ness not to be accounted for, That any In∣nocent Men should put themselves into their Hands; but hitherto they have not been able to obtain that Point. The Gen∣tlemen stand fairly, and are ready to de∣fend themselves fairly; and if they are ac∣cused, it may, with much more Justice and Modesty be said, That the People of <HI>Eng∣land expect</HI> they should be heard fairly, and
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
used fairly; and if Innocent, be acquitted fairly, and not be run down by Pamphlets and Preaching.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> now of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is an Awful Assembly; and it is hoped, they will not permit themselves to be driven, any more than led into any Thing, which their own Wisdom does not satisfie them, is for the good of their Coun∣try. Their Business is well known to them; they will not fail to do their Coun∣try Justice, but they will not be made the Butchers of a Party; No, not altho' they were more compos'd of their own Friends than they are.</P>
<P>We had, indeed, a Sett of Men who were called the <HI>Red-Coat Parliament</HI>; and they were indeed Tools of a Party, and did the Drudgery which was provided for them; whoever they liked not, they found Guil∣ty; whoever their Supporters commanded them to Murther, they Murther'd; to Blast▪ they Blasted; to Sacrifice, they Sacrificed▪ But, those were not a free Parliament; they were nominated Arbitrarily, Sword in Hand▪ as may properly be said by a Usurper and Rebel; who was himself a Murtherer, and a Parricide, in the worst and most odiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sence of that Word; for he was the slaye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Father of his Country.</P>

<P>The Gentlemen push'd at by these Fu¦ries, are Objects of this generous Justice▪ they freely cast themselves upon the Justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their Country; they fly to the Protect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦on of the Laws, which are their Birth¦Right: <PB N="25" REF="24"/>
It behoves the Government to take Care that they have no wrong done them; I say, it behoves the Government, for in such Cases, every Man, who gives himself up to the Law, is under the King's Protection in a more particular manner than an another Person is; for this Reason, Peo∣ple who have been destroy'd in the Tower or in any other Prisons, it hath been esteem∣ed greatly to cast Reproach upon the King himself; seeing a Man imprison'd is taken out of his own Protection, depriv'd of Pow∣er to defend himself, and therefore is in the especial Protection of the Prince: This was alledg'd by the Lawyers as a great Ag∣gravation of the Crime, in the Murther of Sir <HI>Tho. Overbury,</HI> at the Trial of the Mur∣therers, and especially at the Lord <HI>Somerset</HI>'s Trial it was urged, that he had exceeding∣ly dishonour'd the King, in whose particu∣lar Protection Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> then was; and the King, as might be said, was made re∣sponsible for his Life, because, while in Pri∣son, he was in the King's Custody: Like∣wise in the present Case of those Persons, whom the Mad-Men mention'd, exces∣sively rail at, and demand to the Block, as they flee to the Protection of the Laws which are their Birth-Right, so the Go∣vernment is in Charge of them, and is obliged to protect them from every kind of

Injustice, and particularly from that Inju∣stice which is founded on the <HI>Summum Jus</HI> of the Law, which by the received Max∣ims of the Law is <HI>summa injuria.</HI></P>
<P>If the People who Rail in this horrid manner, had nothing to desire but Justice, they would not make so great a Bustle on that account: For why should they doubt of obtaining Justice? It is a great Affront to the King, and Ministry now in be∣ing, that they should make so great Cla∣mours for obtaining <HI>Justice,</HI> as if they found themselves in danger of failing thereof; and that <HI>Justice</HI> would not take place, unless <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> the Ministry were told publick∣ly, that the People <HI>expect it</HI>; implying, that the People will Resent it, if it is not done: I will not give any Credit to that scandalous Supposition, That the present Ministry have desir'd these Men to make publick Clamours for Impeachments, that they may have it to alledge, that they were obliged to do it, by the general Demand of the People: It is a Scandalous Reflection on the Ministers of State, and Merits to be expos'd: If there are Crimes sufficient to warrant an Impeachment of any Men in the Kingdom, the Ministry have given no ground to any, to supect they are backward to do their Country Justice; and the di∣recting

The Case speaks itself: If the Ministry had Reason for falling upon the Persons he aims at, why should he doubt their doing it? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f no Reason, why bully them into it, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elling them in a Threatning manner, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he People EXPECT IT from them.

<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
It sufficiently exposes the baseness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Men, and shews that it is Blood they seek, and Revenge, not Justice, that they take upon them to call every Action they dislike, a Crime against their Country; Things which are against no Law, they call Treason, and demand Men's Heads upon every frivolous Vexatious Pretence, and in a Villanous manner, (<HI>for nothing can be more Villanous</HI>) call Men Traitors be∣fore they are Convicted of any Treasona∣ble Action.</P>
<P>I have said before, that the Libeller <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t</HI> has asserted one Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> That every Officer is answerable for the Exe∣cution of the Queen's <HI>illegal Orders.</HI> The Reverse of this Aphorism it is hoped, hath the same Authority, <HI>viz.</HI> That what the Queen had a Legal Authority to Command, her Servants might legally Execute, and that no Man could be answerable for Exe∣cuting the Queen's <HI>Legal Orders</HI>: Suppo∣sing this to be allow'd, it was natural to search those <HI>illegal Orders</HI> which the Queen had given, and which these Men had Exe∣cuted; and not finding them, or any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, in that Libel, the Men seem not to be answerable at all, in the Opinion of those who judge of this Man's Libel with Impar¦tiality: But to descend to Particulars,</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28"/>
The first Thing he would have them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken up for is, because there were Riots <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Day of Rejoicing for the King's Ac∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ession. No Man approves of Tumults; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as not Justice been done? Was not the Go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernment at a sufficient Charge for a Com∣mission of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> to try these Rio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers at <HI>Bristol?</HI> And, Was not Justice done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here to Fineing and Whipping? Yea, Justice was done, but there was no Blood: Without Blood these Men cannot be appeased, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore the late Ministers of State must be taken into Custody, tho' it does not ap∣pear any of them are concern'd in the said Mobs. This is the Justice these Men are for.</P>
<P>The next Charge is, That Insolent and Seditious Pamphlets have been dispers'd Abroad, and therefore the Heads of the Faction, as he calls the late Queen's Ser∣vants, must be seized. The <HI>English</HI> Li∣berty is such, Thanks be to God, That no Man can be seiz'd and imprison'd without some Crime being Sworn against him; yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his lover of Justice would have these Men seized, because other Men disperse Sediti∣ous Pamphlets; Why not rather the Au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hors ofthose Pamphlets?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
But the next is the main Charge, and of most Weight, <HI>viz.</HI> The Peace; and this it seems is the Treason. It is an undisputed Branch of the Royal Prerogative of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> That the King, or Queen, for Time being, hath the sole Right of making Peace and War; and Learned Lawyers say, That the King is not bound by any Opinions, Representati∣ons, Advice, Resolutions, or any thing of that Nature from the People, in any Capa∣city whatever. Neither have the Parlia∣ment any Right to prescribe the Time, the Manner, or the Condition: If this is not Law, then let the raging Authors shew where the Right is, and Prove it to be so: The other needeth no Evidence, it is ac∣knowledged, even in Parliament, on di∣vers Eminent Occasions, which I am able to produce, there not being room for it here: It being Lawful then for the Queen to make Peace, it was Lawful for Her Majesty to issue out Orders to her Servants, to do eve∣ry Thing that was Necessary, or which Her Majesty thought proper for that End▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or can they be made Answerable for exe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uting those Orders, which it was Lawfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Queen to give.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Their treating by Her Majesty's Orders, with any Prince, or without the Know∣ledge of any Allies, or Confederate; whe∣ther it was so, or not, or whether it was Contrary to Alliances, or not, is not to Pur∣pose. But it must be asked, <HI>Where is the Law</HI> they have broken in it? <HI>What Act of Parliament</HI> is it against? Supposing all was granted, which they alledge, if then, no Act of Parliament has made it Criminal, where is the Crime? <HI>No</HI> Law, <HI>No</HI> Trans∣gression. <HI>Is there an Act of Parliament</HI> that the Queen should not Treat with <HI>France,</HI> without acquainting the <HI>Dutch? Is there a Law</HI> the Queen should not, if she could get <HI>Dunkirk</HI> by the Bargain, make a Cessation of Arms with <HI>France?</HI> That if Prince <HI>Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene</HI> would not come into it, her General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould not draw off from them? <HI>Is there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Act of Parliament,</HI> That the Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould go on with the War, tho' none of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l the Confederates answer'd their Quo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If Laws can be found for these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings, then these Ministers of State may, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps, be found Guilty of High Trea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n; but if not, then it must be otherwise; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd if such Laws are extant, why are they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot quoted by this Lybeller? This is a full Answer to every other Charge they make;
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
for all that he Lybels them with, turn up∣on the same Head.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Was there any Law,</HI> That the Duke of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> should be General? That the other Ministry should never be turn'd out? That the <HI>Catalans</HI> should be support∣ed at <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Charge, after their own Lord had withdrawn from them? Not one Act of Parliament is brought which they have acted against, and yet he calls them <HI>Traytors,</HI> and <HI>expects</HI> their Blood.</P>
<P>There remains but one Thing more in his Clamour, <HI>viz.</HI> Their being <HI>concern'd with the Pretender.</HI> Of this he offers no Facts, no Evidence, no, nor Circumstances, to make good the Charge which he brings; yet <HI>the Blood</HI> of the Queen's Servants must satisfy his inexorable Party; and such is the preposterous Rage of these Men, that it betrays them to gross Absurdity, especially this, That they should threaten the present Ministry, if they do not impeach, <HI>&amp;c</HI>▪ suggesting strongly, as before, that the Mi¦nistry incline not to do it, have not Evi¦dence to support it, and are too sensible▪ that if Justice be done, the Accus'd Per¦sons cannot be hurt; and, that therefore▪ they will press the present Ministry to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
on them, <HI>per fas aut Nefas,</HI> and to cast them by Number of Voices, Whether they are guilty, or not guilty?</P>
<P>To conclude, there seems to be the Height of Malice and Party-Rage in all these Things, and nothing of Justice is concern'd in it; the Temper is hellish; the Men scandalous; they are a Satyr upon themselves, and all good Men abhor them: The doing Justice on Offenders none can oppose, neither is any thing in this Tract offer'd against it; but let not Justice be pretended, and the Pretence be made a Stalking-Horse, to introduce the private Revenge of disobliged Persons, or Parties; let not Publick Justice be hackney'd out to Men of no Principles; this will bring inno∣cent Blood upon the Nation, and who knows when the Thirst will be quenched?</P>
<P>The King is a Prince of Wisdom and Prudence, and it is hop'd he will shew that Moderation in the midst of these vio∣lent Extremes, as may preserve the Peace of his People, and prevent that <HI>Cannibal</HI> Tem∣per, which would set one half of his Peo∣ple to devour the other; and it is especially hoped, His Majesty will take the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which he has sworn to main∣tain,
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
into his peculiar Consideration, and inform himself exactly who they are, who may be said to constitute that Church, Whether the few who side with these Men, or Ten Twelfths of the Clergy, who, as some think, is the least of those who are disobliged by these Men.</P>
<P>The Affront offer'd by this filthy Li¦beller to the Government, merits Contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and the Author is no otherwise wort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> naming, than to let the World see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cause, by its being espoused only by such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> detestable Person.</P>
