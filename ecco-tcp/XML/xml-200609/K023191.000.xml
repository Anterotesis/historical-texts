humble Lays,</L>
<L>And let each grateful <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> neigh thy Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O happy <HI>Yahoo,</HI> purg'd from human Crimes,</L>
<L>By thy sweet Sojourn in those virtuous Climes,</L>
<L>Where reign our Sires! There, to thy Countrey's
Shame,</L>
<L>Reason, you found, and Virtue were the same.</L>
<L>Their Precepts raz'd the Prejudice of Youth,</L>
<L>And even a <HI>Yahoo</HI> learn'd the Love of Truth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Art thou the first who did the Coast explore;</L>
<L>Did never <HI>Yahoo</HI> tread that Ground before?</L>
<L>Yes Thousands. But in Pity to their Kind,</L>
<L>Or sway'd by Envy, or through Pride of Mind,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
They hid their Knowledge of a nobler Race,</L>
<L>Which own'd, would all their Sires and Sons disgrace.</L>

<L>And by their wiser Morals mend your own.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Orpheus</HI> travell'd to reform his Kind,</L>
<L>Came back, and tam'd the Brutes he left behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You went, you saw, you heard: With Virtue fought,</L>
<L>Then spread those Morals which the <HI>Houyhnhnms</HI>
taught.</L>
<L>Our Labours here must touch thy gen'rous Heart,</L>
<L>To see us strain before the Coach and Cart;</L>
<L>Compell'd to run each knavish Jockey's Heat!</L>
<L>Subservient to <HI>New-market</HI>'s annual Cheat!</L>
<L>With what Reluctance do we Lawyers bear,</L>
<L>To fleece their Countrey Clients twice a Year?</L>
<L>Or manag'd in your Schools, for Fops to ride,</L>
<L>How foam, how fret beneath a Load of Pride!</L>
<L>Yes, we are Slaves—but yet, by Reason's Force,</L>
<L>Have learnt to bear Misfortune, like a Horse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O would the Stars, to ease my Bonds, ordain,</L>
<L>That gentle <HI>Gulliver</HI> might guide my Rein!</L>
<L>Safe would I bear him to his Journey's End,</L>
<L>For 'tis a Pleasure to support a Friend.</L>
<L>But if my Life be doom'd to serve the Bad,</L>
<L>O! may'st thou never want an easy Pad!</L>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Captain some time after his Return, being retir'd
to Mr. Sympson's in the Countrey, Mrs. Gulliver,
apprehending from his late Behaviour some E∣strangement
of his Affections, writes him the fol∣lowing
expostulating, soothing, and tenderly-com∣plaing
EPISTLE.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ELCOME, thrice welcome to thy
native Place!</L>
<L>—What, touch me not? what,</L>
<L>shun a wife's Embrace?</L>
<L>Have I for this thy tedious Absence
born,</L>
<L>And wak'd and wish'd whole Nights for thy Return?</L>
<L>In five long Years I took no second Spouse;</L>
<L>What <HI>Redriff</HI> Wife so long hath kept her Vows?</L>
<L>Your Eyes, your Nose, Inconstancy betray;</L>
<L>Your Nose you stop, your Eyes you turn away.</L>

<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<L>'Tis said, that thou shouldst <HI>cleave unto thy Wife</HI>;</L>
<L>Once <HI>thou</HI> didst cleave, and <HI>I</HI> could cleave for Life.</L>
<L>Hear and relent! hark, how thy Children moan;</L>
<L>Be kind at least to these, they are thy own:</L>
<L>Behold, and count them all; secure to find</L>
<L>The honest Number that you left behind.</L>
<L>See how they pat thee with their pretty Paws:</L>
<L>Why start you? are they Snakes? or have they Claws?</L>
<L>Thy Christian Seed, our mutual Flesh and Bone:</L>
<L>Be kind at least to these, they are thy own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Biddel</HI> like thee, might farthest <HI>India</HI> rove;</L>

<L>There's Captain <HI>Pannel,</HI> absent half his Life,</L>
<L>Comes back, and is the kinder to his Wife.</L>
<L>Yet <HI>Pannel</HI>'s Wife is brown, compar'd to me,</L>
<L>And Mistress <HI>Biddel</HI> sure is Fifty three.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not touch me! never Neighbour call'd me Slut!</L>
<L>Was <HI>Flimnap</HI>'s Dame more sweet in <HI>Lilliput?</HI></L>
<L>I've no red Hair to breath an odious Fume;</L>
<L>At least thy Consort's cleaner than thy <HI>Groom.</HI></L>
<L>Why then that dirty Stable-boy thy Care?</L>
<L>What mean those Visits to the <HI>Sorrel Mare?</HI></L>
<L>Say, by what Witchcraft, or what Daemon led,</L>
<L>Preferr'st thou <HI>Litter</HI> to the Marriage Bed?</L>

<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<L>Some say the Dev'l himself is in that <HI>Mare</HI>:</L>
<L>If so, our <HI>Dean</HI> shall drive him forth by Prayer.</L>
<L>Some think you mad, some think you are possest,</L>
<L>That <HI>Bedlam</HI> and clean Straw would suit you best:</L>
<L>Vain means, alas, this Frenzy to appease!</L>
<L>That <HI>Straw,</HI> that <HI>Straw</HI> would heighten the Disease.</L>

<LG>
<L>My Bed, (the Scene of all our former Joys,</L>
<L>Witness two lovely Girls, two lovely Boys)</L>
<L>Alone I press; in Dreams I call my Dear,</L>
<L>I stretch my Hand; no <HI>Gulliver</HI> is there!</L>
<L>I wake, I rise, and shiv'ring with the Frost,</L>
<L>Search all the House; my <HI>Gulliver</HI> is lost!</L>
<L>Forth in the Street I rush with frantick Cries;</L>
<L>The Windows open; all the Neighbours rise:</L>
<L><HI>Where sleeps my</HI> Gulliver? <HI>O tell me where?</HI></L>
<L>The Neighbours answer, "<HI>With the Sorrel Mare.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At early Morn, I to the Market haste,</L>
<L>(Studious in ev'ry thing to please thy Taste)</L>
<L>A curious <HI>Fowl</HI> and <HI>Sparagrass</HI> I chose,</L>
<L>(For I remember'd you were fond of those)</L>
<L>Three Shillings cost the first, the last sev'n Groats;</L>
<L>Sullen you turn'd from both, and call'd for <HI>Oats.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Others bring Goods and Treasures to their Houses.</L>
<L>Something to deck their pretty Babes and Spouses;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
My <HI>only</HI> Token was a Cup like Horn,</L>
<L>That's made of nothing but a Lady's <HI>Corn.</HI></L>
<L>'Tis not for that I grieve; O, 'tis to see</L>
<L>The <HI>Groom</HI> and <HI>Sorrel Mare</HI> prefer'd to me!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These for some Moments when you deign to quit,</L>
<L>And (at due distance) sweet Discourse admit,</L>
<L>'Tis all my Pleasure thy past Toil to know,</L>
<L>For pleas'd Remembrance builds Delight on Woe.</L>
<L>At ev'ry Danger pants thy Consort's Breast,</L>
<L>And gaping Infants squawle to hear the rest.</L>
<L>How did I tremble, when by Tousands bound,</L>
<L>I saw thee stretch'd on <HI>Lilliputian</HI> Ground;</L>
<L>When scaling Armies climb'd up ev'ry Part,</L>
<L>Each Step they trod, I felt upon my Heart.</L>
<L>But when thy Torrent quench'd the dreadful Blaze,</L>
<L>King, Queen and Nation staring with Amaze,</L>
<L>Full in my view how all my Husband came,</L>
<L>And what extinguish'd theirs, encreas'd my Flame.</L>
<L>Those <HI>Spectacles,</HI> ordain'd thine Eyes to save,</L>
<L>Were once my Present; <HI>Love</HI> that Armour gave.</L>
<L>How did I mourn at <HI>Bolgolam</HI>'s Decree!</L>
<L>For when he sign'd thy Death, he sentenc'd me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Folks might see thee all the Country round</L>
<L>For Six pence, I'd have giv'n a Thousand pound.</L>
<L>Lord! when the <HI>Giant-babe</HI> that Head of thine</L>
<L>Got in his Mouth, my Heart was up in mine!</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
When in the <HI>Marrow-bone</HI> I see thee ramm'd,</L>
<L>Or on the House-top by the <HI>Monkey</HI> cramm'd;</L>
<L>The piteous Images renew my Pain,</L>
<L>And all thy Dangers I weep o'er again!</L>
<L>But on the <HI>Maiden's-Nipple</HI> when you rid,</L>
<L>Pray Heav'n, 'twas all a wanton Maiden did!</L>
<L><HI>Glumdalclitch</HI> too!—with thee I mourn her Case,</L>
<L>Heav'n guard the gentle Girl from all Disgrace!</L>
<L>O may the King that one Neglect forgive,</L>
<L>And pardon her the Fault by which I live!</L>
<L>Was there no other Way to set him free?</L>
<L>My Life, alas, I fear prov'd Death to Thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O teach me, dear, new words to speak my Flame;</L>
<L>Teach me to wooe thee by thy best-lov'd Name!</L>
<L>Whether the Stile of <HI>Grildrig</HI> please thee most,</L>
<L>So call'd on <HI>Brobdingnag</HI>'s stupendious Coast,</L>
<L>When on the Monarch's ample Hand you sate,</L>
<L>And hollow'd in his Ear, Intrigues of State:</L>
<L>Or <HI>Quinbus Flestrin</HI> more Endearment brings,</L>
<L>When like a Mountain you look'd down on Kings:</L>
<L>If Ducal <HI>Nardae, Lilliputian</HI> Peer,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Glumglum</HI>'s humbler Title sooth thy Ear;</L>
<L>Nay, would kind <HI>Jove</HI> my Organs so dispose,</L>
<L>To hymn harmonious <HI>Houyhnhnm</HI> thro' the Nose,</L>
<L>I'd call thee <HI>Houyhnhnm,</HI> that high sounding Name,</L>
<L>Thy Children's Noses all should twang the same.</L>
<L>So might I find my loving Spouse of course</L>
