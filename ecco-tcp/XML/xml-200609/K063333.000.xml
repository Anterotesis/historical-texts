<HEAD>For the Encouragement of so useful a Work, it is
thought fit the Publick should be inform'd of
the Contents of the First Volume, by one who
has with great Care perus'd the <HI>Manuscript.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Author, in his Preface, makes
some very judicious Reflexions upon
the Original of Arts and Sciences; That at
first they consist of scatter'd Theorems and
Practices, which are handed about amongst
the Masters, and only reveal'd to the <HI>Filii
Artis,</HI> till such time as some great Genius
appears, who Collects these disjointed Propo∣sitions,
and reduces them into a regular Sy∣stem.
That this is the Case of that Noble
and Useful Art of <HI>Political Lying,</HI> which in
this last Age having been enrich'd with se∣veral
new Discoveries, ought not to lie any
longer in Rubbish and Confusion, but may
justly claim a Place in the <HI>Encyclopedia,</HI> espe∣cially
such as serves for a Model of Educati∣on
for an able Politcian; that he proposes to
himself no small Stock of Fame in future Ages,
in being the first who has undertaken this
Design; and for the same Reason he hopes
the Imperfection of his Work will be excused.
He invites all Persons who have any Talent
that way, or any new Discovery, to commu∣nicate
their Thoughts, assuring them that
honorable mention shall be made of them in
his Work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>The First Volume consists of Eleven Chapters.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In the first Chapter of his excellent Trea∣tise,
he reasons Philosophically concerning the
Nature of the Soul of Man, and those Qua∣lities
which render it susceptible of Lyes. He
supposes the Soul to be of the Nature of a
<HI>Plano-Cylindrical Speculum,</HI> or Looking-glass;
that the plain side was made by God Almigh∣ty,
but that the Devil afterwards wrought
the other side into a Cylindrical Figure. The
plain side represents Objects just as they are,
and the Cylindrical side, by the Rules of
Catoptricks, must needs represent true Objects
false, and false Objects true; but the Cylin∣drical
side being much the larger Surface,
takes in a greater Compass of visual Rays.
That upon the Cylindrical side of the Soul
of Man depends the whole Art and Success
of <HI>Political Lying.</HI> The Author, in this Chap∣ter,
proceeds to reason upon the other Qua∣lities
of the Mind; As, great Fondness of the
<HI>Malicious</HI> and the <HI>Miraculous:</HI> The Tendency
of the Soul towards the <HI>Malicious,</HI> springs
from Self-love, or a Pleasure to find Man∣kind
more wicked, base, or unfortunate, than
our selves. The Design of the <HI>Miraculous,</HI>
proceeds from the Inactivity of the Soul, or
its Incapacity to be moved or delighted with
any thing that is vulgar or common. The
Author having establish'd the Qualities of the
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
MIND, upon which his Art is founded, he
proceeds,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Second Chapter, to Treat of the
Nature of <HI>Political Lying</HI>; which he defines,
to be, <HI>The Art of convincing the People of</HI> Salu∣tary
Falshoods, <HI>for some good End.</HI> He calls it
an <HI>Art</HI> to distinguish it from that of telling
Truth, which does not seem to want <HI>Art</HI>;
but then he would have this understood on∣ly
as to the Invention, because there is indeed
more Art necessary to convince the People
of a <HI>Salutary</HI> Truth, than a <HI>Salutary</HI> Falshood.
Then he proceeds to prove, that there are
<HI>Salutary</HI> Falshoods, of which he gives a great
many Instances both before and after the
Revolution; and demonstrates plainly, that
we could not have carried, on the War so
long, without several of those <HI>Salutary</HI> Fals∣hoods.
He gives Rules to calculate the Va∣lue
of a <HI>Political Lye,</HI> in Pounds, Shillings,
and Pence. By <HI>Good,</HI> he does not mean that
which is absolutely so, but what appears so
to the Artist, which is a sufficient Ground
for him to proceed upon; and. he distinguishes
the Good, as it commonly, is, into <HI>Bonum
utile, dulce, &amp; honestum.</HI> He shews you, that
there are <HI>Political Lyes</HI> of a mix'd Nature,
which include all the <HI>Three</HI> in different respects▪
That the <HI>Utile</HI> reigns generally about the
<HI>Exchange,</HI> the <HI>Dulce</HI> and <HI>Honestum</HI> at the <HI>West∣minster</HI> End of the Town. One Man spreads
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
a Lye to sell or Buy Stock to greater Advan∣tage;
a second, because it is honorable to
serve his Party; and a third, because it is
sweet to gratify his Revenge. Having ex∣plain'd
the several Terms of his Definition,
he proceeds,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Third Chapter, to treat of the Law∣fulness
of <HI>Political Lying</HI>; which he deduces
from its true and genuine Principles, by en∣quiring
into the several Rights that Man∣kind
have to Truth. He shews, that the
People have a Right to private Truth from
their Neighbours, and oeconomical Truth
from their own Family; that they should
not be abused by their Wives, Children, and
Servants; but, that they have no Right at
all to <HI>Political</HI> Truth: That the People may
as well all pretend to be Lords of Mannors
and possess great Estates, as to have Truth
told them in Matters of Government. The
Author, with great Judgment, states the se∣veral
Shares of Mankind in this Matter of
Truth, according to their several Capacities,
Dignities, and Professions; and shews you,
that Children have hardly any share at all; in
consequence of which, they have very seldom
any Truth told them. It must be own'd,
that the Author, in this Chapter, has some
seeming Difficulties to answer and explain
Texts of Scripture, and a Sermon lately
Preach'd before Her Majesty at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<P>The Fourth Chapter is wholly employed
in this Queston, <HI>Whether the Right of Coinage
of Political Lyes be wholly in the Government?</HI>
The Author, who is a true Friend to <HI>English</HI>
Liberty, determines in the Negative, and
answers all the Arguments of the opposite
Party with great Acuteness; That as the Go∣vernment
of <HI>England</HI> has a Mixture of De∣mocratical
in it, so the Right of Inventing
and Spreading <HI>Political Lyes,</HI> is partly in the
People; and their obstinate Adherence to this
just Privilege has been most conspicuous, and
shin'd with great Lustre of late Years: That
it happens very often, that there is no other
Means left to the good People of <HI>England</HI>
to pull down a Ministry and Government
they are weary of, but by exercising this
their undoubted Right: That abundance of
<HI>Political Lying</HI> is a sure sign of true <HI>English</HI>
Liberty: That as Ministers do sometimes
use Tools to support their Power, it is but
reasonable that the People should employ the
same Weapon to defend themselves, and pull
them down.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Fifth Chapter, he divides <HI>Political
Lyes</HI> into their several Species and Classes,
and gives Precepts about the Inventing,
Spreading, and Propagating the several sorts
of them: He begins with the <HI>Rumores,</HI> and
<HI>Libelli famosi,</HI> such as concern the Reputation
of Men in Power; where he finds Fault
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
with the common Mistake, that takes No∣tice
only of one sort, <HI>viz.</HI> the Detractory
or Defamatory, whereas in truth there are
three sorts, the Detractory, the Additory,
and the Translatory. The Additory gives
to a Great Man a greater share of Reputa∣tion
than belongs to him, to enable him to
serve some good End or Purpose. The De∣tractory
or Defamatory, is a Lye which
takes from a Great Man the Reputation that
justly belongs to him, for fear he should use
it to the Detriment of the Publick. The
Translatory, is a Lye that transfers the Me∣rit
of a Man's good Action to another who
is in himself more deserving; or, transfers
the Demerit of a bad Action from the true
Author, to a Person who is in himself less deser∣ving.
He gives several Instances of very great
Strokes in all the Three Kinds, especially in
the last, when it was necessary for the Good
of the Publick to bestow the Valour and Con∣duct
of one Man upon another, and that
of many to one Man; nay, even upon a
good Occasion, a Man may be rob'd of his
Victory by a Person that did not Command
in the Action. The Restoring and the De∣stroying
the Publick may be ascrib'd to Per∣sons
who had no hand in either. The Au∣thor
exhorts all Gentlemen Practitioners to
exercise themselves in the Translatory, be∣cause
the Existence of the Things them∣selves
being visible, and not demanding any
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
Proof, there wants nothing to be put upon
the Publick but a false Author or a false
Cause, which is no great Presumption upon
the Credulity of Mankind, to whom the se∣cret
Springs of things are for the most part
unknown.</P>
<P>The Author proceeds to give some Pre∣cepts
as to the Additory. That when one
ascribes any thing to a Person which does not
belong to him, the Lye ought to be calcu∣lated
not quite contradictory to his known
Qualities: <HI>Ex. gr.</HI> One would not make the
<HI>French</HI> King present at a Protestant Conven∣ticle;
nor, like Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> restore the
Overplus of Taxes to her Subjects. One
would not bring in the <HI>Emperor</HI> giving two
Months Pay in Advance to his Troops; nor
the <HI>Dutch</HI> paying more, than their <HI>Quota.</HI>
One would not make the same Person zea∣lous
for a Standing Army and Publick Li∣berty;
nor an Atheist support the Church;
nor a lewd Fellow a Reformer of Manners;
nor a hot-headed crack-brain'd Coxcomb for∣ward
for a Scheme of Moderation. But if
it is absolutely necessary that a Person is to
have some good adventitious Quality given
him, the Author's Precept is, that it should
not be done at first in <HI>extremo gradu.</HI> For
Example: They should not make, a Covetous
Man give away all at once, Five thousand
Pounds in a charitable generous way; Twen∣ty
or Thirty Pounds may suffice at first,
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
They should not introduce a Person of re∣markable
Ingratitude to his Benefactors, re∣warding
a poor Man for some good Office
that was done him thirty Years ago; but
they may allow him to acknowledge a Ser∣vice
to a Person who is capable still to do
him another. A Man whose personal Cou∣rage
is suspected, is not at first to drive
whole Squadrons before him; but he may
be allow'd the Merit of some Squabble, or
throwing a Bottle at his Adversary's Head.</P>
<P>It will not be allow'd, to make a Great
Man, that is a known Despiser of Religion,
spend whole Days in his Closet at his Devo∣tion;
but, you may with Safety make him
sit out publick Prayers with Decency. A
Great Man, who has never been known wil∣lingly
to pay a just Debt, ought not all of
a sudden to be introduc'd making Resti∣tution
of Thousands he has cheated; let it
suffice at first, to pay Twenty Pounds to a
Friend who has lost his Note.</P>
<P>He lays down the same Rules in the De∣tractory
or Defamatory kind; that they
should not be quite opposite to the Qualities
the Persons are supposed to have. Thus it
will not be found, according to the found
Rules of <HI>Pseudology,</HI> to report of a pious and
religious Prince, that he neglects his Devo∣tion,
and would introduce Heresy; but, you
may report of a merciful Prince, that he has
Pardon'd a Criminal who did not deserve it.
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
You will be unsuccessful if you give out of a
Great Man, who is remarkable for his Fru∣gality
for the Publick, that he squanders away
the Nation's Money; but, you may safely re∣late
that he hoards it: You must not affirm
he took a Bribe; but, you may freely censure
him for being tardy in his Payments; Be∣cause
though neither may be true, yet the
last is credible, the first not. Of an open∣hearted
generous Minister you are not to
say, that he was in an Intrigue to Betray
his Country; but, you may affirm with
some Probability, that he was in an In∣trigue
with a Lady. He warns all Practi∣tioners
to take good heed to these Precepts,
for want of which, many of their Lies, of
late, have prov'd abortive on short-liv'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Sixth Chapter he treats of the <HI>Mi∣raculous</HI>;
by which he understands any thing
that exceeds the common Degrees of Proba∣bility.
In respect of the People, it is divi∣ded
into two sorts, the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
Terrifying Lyes, and Animating or
Encouraging Lyes, both being extremely
useful on their proper Occasions. Concern∣ing
the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he gives several Rules;
one of which is, that terrible Objects should
not be too frequently shewn to the People,
lest they grow familiar. He says, it is ab∣solutely
necessary that the People of <HI>England</HI>
should be frighted with the <HI>French</HI> King and
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
the <HI>Pretender</HI> once a Year; but, that the
Bears should be chain'd up again till that
time Twelve-month. The want of Obser∣ving
this so necessary a Precept, in bring∣ing
out the <HI>Raw-head and Bloody-bones</HI> upon
every trifling Occasion, has produc'd great
Indifference in the Vulgar of late Years. As
to the Animating or Encouraging Lyes, he
gives the following Rules; That they should
not far exceed the common degrees of Pro∣bability,
and that there should be variety
of them, and the same Lye not obstinately
insisted upon; that the Promissory or Prog∣nosticating
Lyes should not be upon short
Days, for fear the Authors should have the
Shame and Confusion to see themselves spee∣dily
contradicted. He examines by these
Rules, that well-meant, but unfortunate Lye
of the Conquest of <HI>France,</HI> which continued
near twenty Years together; but at last, by
being too obstinately insisted upon, it was
worn threadbare, and became unsuccessful.</P>
<P>As to the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or the <HI>Prodigious,</HI>
he has little to advise, but that their Co∣mets,
Whales and Dragons, should be siza∣ble;
their Storms, Tempests, and Earth∣quakes,
without the reach of a Days Jour∣ney
of a Man and a Horse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The Seventh Chapter is wholly taken up
in an Enquiry, Which of the two Parties are
the greatest Artists in <HI>Political Lying.</HI> He
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
owns the <HI>Tories</HI> have been better believed of
late; but, that the <HI>Whigs</HI> have much the
greater Genius's amongst them. He attri∣butes
the late ill Success of the <HI>Whig-Party</HI>
to their glutting the Market, and retailing
too much of a bad Commodity at once:
When there is too great a Quantity of
Worms, it is hard to catch Gudgeons. He
proposes a Scheme for the Recovery of the
Credit of the <HI>Whig-Party,</HI> which indeed
seems to be somewhat Chimerical, and does
not savour of that sound Judgment the
Author has shown in the rest of the Work
It amounts to this, That the Party should
agree to vent nothing but Truth for three
Months together, which will give them Cre∣dit
for six Months Lying afterwards. He
owns, that he believes it almost impossible
to find fit Persons to execute this Scheme.
Towards the end of the Chapter, he in∣veighs
severely against the Folly of Parties,
in retaining such Scoundrels and Men of
Low Genius's to retail their Lyes; such as
most of the present News-Writers are, who
besides a strong Bent and Inclination towards
the Profession, seem to be wholly ignorant
in the Rules of <HI>Pseudology,</HI> and not at all
qualified for so weighty a Trust.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>In his Eighth Chapter he treats of some
extraordinary Genius's who have appear'd of
late Years, especially in their Disposition to∣wards
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
the <HI>Miraculous.</HI> He advises those
hopeful Young-men to turn their Invention
to the Service of their Country, it being
inglorious, at this time, to employ their Ta∣lent
in prodigious Fox-Chases, Horse-Courses,
Feats of Activity in Driving of Coaches,
Jumping, Running, Swallowing of Peaches,
Pulling out whole Sets of Teeth to clean, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
when their Country stands so much in need
of their Assistance.</P>
<P>The Eighth Chapter is a Project for Uni∣ting
the several smaller Corporations of Lyars
into one Society. It is too tedious to give
a full Account of the whole Scheme; what
is most remarkable is, That this Society ought
to consist of the Heads of each Party; that
no Lye is to pass current without their Ap∣probation,
they being the best Judges of the
present Exigencies, and what sort of Lyes
are demanded: That in such a Corporation
there ought to be Men of all Professions,
that the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is,
<HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Probability,</HI> may be observ'd as
much as possible: That besides the Persons
above-mentioned, this Society ought to con∣sist
of the hopeful Genius's about the Town
(of which there are great plenty to be pick'd
up in the several Coffee-houses) Travellers,
Virtuoso's, Fox-hunters, Jockeys, Attorneys,
Old Sea-men and Soldiers out of the Hospi∣tals
of <HI>Greenwich</HI> and <HI>Chelsea.</HI> To this So∣ciety,
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
so Constituted, ought to be committed
the sole Management of <HI>Lying.</HI> That in their
outer Room there ought always to attend
some Persons endow'd with a great Stock of
Credulity, a Generation that thrives mightily
in this Soil and Climate: He thinks a sufficient
Number of them may be pick'd up any where
about the <HI>Exchange:</HI> These are to Circulate
what the other Coin; for no Man spreads a
Lye with so good a Grace as he that be∣lieves
it. That the Rule of the Society be
to invent a Lye, and sometimes two, for eve∣ry
Day; in the Choice of which, great Re∣gard
ought to be had to the Weather, and
the Season of the Year: Your <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Ter∣rifying
Lyes,</HI> do mighty well in <HI>November</HI> and
<HI>December,</HI> but not so well in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI>
unless the Easterly Winds reign. That it
ought to be Penal, for any body to talk of
any thing but the Lye of the Day. That
the Society is to maintain a sufficient Num∣ber
of Spies at Court, and other Places, to
furnish Hints and Topicks for Invention;
and a general Correspondence in all the
Market-Towns, for Circulating their Lyes.
That if any one of die Society were observ'd
to blush, or look out of Countenance, or
want a necessary Circumstance in telling
the Lye, he ought to be expell'd, and de∣clar'd
incapable. Besides the Roaring Lies,
there ought to be a private Committee for
Whispers, constituted of the ablest Men of
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
the Society. Here the Author makes a Di∣gression
in Praise of the <HI>Whig-Party,</HI> for the
right Understanding and Use of <HI>Proof-Lyes.</HI>
A <HI>Proof-Lye</HI> is like a Proof-Charge for a
Piece of Ordnance, to try a Standard-Credu∣lity.
Of such a nature he takes Transubstan∣tiation
to be in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> a Proof∣Article,
which if any one swallows, they are
sure he will digest every thing else. There∣fore
the <HI>Whig-Party</HI> do wisely, to try the
Credulity of the People sometimes by <HI>Swin∣gers,</HI>
that they may be able to judge to what
heighth they may Charge them afterwards.
Towards the End of this Chapter, he warns
the Heads of Parties against Believing their
own Lyes; which has prov'd of pernicious
Consequence of late, both a Wise Party
and a Wise Nation having regulated their Affairs
upon Lyes of their own Invention. The
Causes of this he supposes to be too great a
Zeal and Intenseness in the Practice of this
<HI>Art,</HI> and a vehement Heat in mutual Con∣versation,
whereby they perswade one ano∣ther,
that what they wish, and report to be
true, is really so. That all Parties have been
subject to this Misfortune: The <HI>Jacobites</HI>
have been constantly infested with it; but,
the <HI>Whigs</HI> of late seem ev'n to exceed them
in this ill Habit and Weakness. To this
Chapter, the Author subjoins a Calendar of
Lyes proper for the several Months of the
Year.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<P>The Ninth Chapter treats of the Celerity
and Duration of Lyes. As to the Celerity
of their Motion, the Author says it is almost
incredible: He gives several Instances of Lyes
that have gone faster than a Man can ride
Post: Your <HI>Terrifying Lyes</HI> travel at a prodi∣gious
rate, above ten Miles an hour; your
Whispers move in a narrow Vortex, but ve∣ry
swiftly. The Author says it is impos∣sible
to explain several <HI>Phoenomena</HI> in relation
to the Celerity of Lyes, without the Suppo∣sition
of <HI>Synchronism</HI> and <HI>Combination.</HI> As to
the Duration of Lyes, he says they are of all
sorts, from Hours and Days to Ages; that
there are some which, like your Insects, die and
revive again in a different Form; that good
Artists, like People who build upon a short
Lease, will calculate the Duration of a
Lye surely to answer their purpose; to last
just as long, and no longer, than the Turn
is serv'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The Tenth Chapter treats of the Chara∣cteristicks
of Lyes; how to know, when,
where, and by whom invented: Your <HI>Dutch,
English,</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Ware, are amply distin∣guish'd
from one another; an <HI>Exchange-Lye</HI>
from one Coin'd at the other End of the
Town; Great Judgment is to be shewn
as to the Place where the Species is intended
to Circulate: Very low and base Coin will
serve for <HI>Wapping:</HI> There are several Coffee∣houses
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
that have their particular Stamps, which
a judicious Practitioner may easily know.
All your Great Men have their proper <HI>Phan∣tateusticks.</HI>
The Author says he has attained,
by Study and Application, to so great Skill
in this Matter, that bring him any Lye, he
can tell whose Image it bears so truly, as
the Great Man himself shall not have the
face to deny it. The Promissory Lyes of
Great Men are known by Shouldering, Hug∣ging,
Squeezing, Smiling, Bowing; and Lyes
in Matter of Fact, by immoderate Swearing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subsection">
<P>He spends the whole Eleventh Chapter on
one simple Question, <HI>Whether a Lye is best
contradicted by Truth, or another Lye.</HI> The
Author says, that considering the large Ex∣tent
of the Cylindrical Surface of the Soul,
and the great Propensity to believe Lyes in
the generality of Mankind of late Years, he
thinks the properest Contradiction to a Lye,
is another Lye: For Example; If it should be
reported that the Pretender was at <HI>London,</HI>
one would not contradict it by saying he
never was in <HI>England</HI>; but you must prove
by Eye-witnesses that he came no farther
than <HI>Greenwich,</HI> but then went back again.
Thus if it be spread about that a great Per∣son
were dying of some Disease, you must
not say the Truth, that they are in Health,
and never had such a Disease; but, that they
are slowly recovering of it. So there was,
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
not long ago, a Gentleman who affirmed,
That the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> for bringing in
Popery and Slavery into <HI>England,</HI> was Sign'd
the 15th of <HI>September</HI>; to which another an∣swered
very judiciously, not by opposing
Truth to his Lye, That there was no such
Treaty; but that, to his certain Know∣ledge,
there were many things in that Treaty
