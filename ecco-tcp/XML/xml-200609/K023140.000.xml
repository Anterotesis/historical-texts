SATYR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WELL, if it be my time to quit the Stage,</L>
<L>Adieu to all the Follies of the Age!</L>
<L>I die in Charity with Fool and Knave,</L>
<L>Secure of Happiness beyond the Grave.</L>
<L>I've had my <HI>Purgatory</HI> here betimes,</L>
<L>And paid for all my Satires, all my Rhymes:</L>
<L>The Poet's Hell, its Tortures, Fiends and Flames,</L>
<L>To this were Trifles, Toys, and empty Names.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<L>With foolish <HI>Pride</HI> my Heart was never fir'd,</L>
<L>Nor the vain Itch <HI>t'admire,</HI> or <HI>be admir'd;</HI></L>
<L>I hop'd for no <HI>Commission</HI> from his Grace;</L>
<L>I bought no <HI>Benefice,</HI> I begg'd no <HI>Place;</HI></L>
<L>Had no <HI>new-Verses,</HI> or <HI>new Suit</HI> to show;</L>
<L>Yet went to COURT!—the Dev'l wou'd have it so.</L>
<L>But, as the Fool, that in reforming Days</L>
<L>Wou'd go to Mass in jest, (as Story says)</L>
<L>Could not but think, to pay his <HI>Fine</HI> was odd,</L>
<L>Since 'twas no form'd Design of serving God:</L>
<L>Such was my Fate; whom Heav'n adjudg'd as <HI>proud,</HI></L>
<L>As prone to <HI>Ill,</HI> as negligent of <HI>Good,</HI></L>
<L>As deep in <HI>Debt,</HI> without a thought to pay,</L>
<L>As <HI>vain,</HI> as <HI>idle,</HI> and as <HI>false,</HI> as they</L>
<L>Who <HI>live</HI> at <HI>Court,</HI> for going once that Way!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce was I enter'd, when behold! there came</L>
<L>A Thing which <HI>Adam</HI> had been pos'd to name;</L>
<L><HI>Noah</HI> had refus'd it lodging in his Ark,</L>
<L>Where all the Race of <HI>Reptiles</HI> might embark:</L>
<L>A verier Monster than on <HI>Africk</HI>'s Shore</L>
<L>The Sun e're got, or slimy <HI>Nilus</HI> bore,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Sloane,</HI> or <HI>Woodward</HI>'s wondrous. Shelves contain;</L>
<L>Nay, all that lying Travellers can feign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>This Thing has <HI>travell'd,</HI> speaks each Language too,</L>
<L>And knows what's fit for ev'ry State to do;</L>
<L>Of whofe best Phrase and courtly Accent join'd,</L>
<L>He forms one Tongue exotic and refin'd.</L>
<L>Talkers, I've learn'd to bear; <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>tt<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>x</HI> I knew,</L>
<L><HI>Henley</HI> himself I've heard, nay <HI>B<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>dg<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l</HI> too:</L>
<L>The Doctor's Wormwood Style, the Hash of Tongues,</L>
<L>A Pedant makes; the Storm of <HI>G<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n</HI>'s Lungs,</L>
<L>The whole Artill'ry of the Terms of War,</L>
<L>And (all those Plagues in one) the bawling Bar;</L>
<L>These I cou'd bear; but not a Rogue so civil,</L>
<L>Whose Tongue can complement you to the Devil.</L>
<L>A Tongue that can cheat Widows, cancel Scores,</L>
<L>Make <HI>Scots</HI> speak Treason, cozen subtlest Whores,</L>
<L>With Royal Favourites in Flatt'ry vie,</L>
<L>And <HI>Oldmixon</HI> and <HI>Burnet</HI> both out-lie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spies me out. I whisper, gracious God!</L>
<L>What Sin of mine cou'd merit such a Rod?</L>
<L>That all the Shot of Dulness now must be</L>
<L>From this thy Blunderbuss discharg'd on me!</L>
<L>Well met (he cries) and happy sure for each,</L>
<L>For I am pleas'd to learn, and you to teach;</L>
<L>What <HI>Speech</HI> esteem you most?—"The <HI>King</HI>'s, said I,</L>
<L>But the best <HI>Words?</HI>—"O Sir, the <HI>Dictionary.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5"/>
You miss my aim; I mean the most acute</L>
<L>And perfect <HI>Speaker?—"Onslow,</HI> past dispute.</L>
<L>But Sir, of Writers?—"<HI>Swift,</HI> for closer Style,</L>
<L>"And <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y</HI> for a Period of a Mile.</L>
<L>Why yes, 'tis granted, these indeed may pass;</L>
<L>Good common Linguists, and so <HI>Panurge</HI> was:</L>
<L>Nay troth, th'<HI>Apostles,</HI> (tho' perhaps too rough)</L>
<L>Had once a pretty Gift of Tongues enough.</L>
<L>Yet these were all <HI>poor Gentlemen!</HI> I dare</L>
<L>Affirm, 'twas <HI>Travel</HI> made them what they were.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus others Talents having nicely shown,</L>
<L>He came by soft Transition to his own:</L>
<L>Till I cry'd out, You prove yourself so able,</L>
<L>Pity! you was not Druggerman at <HI>Babel:</HI></L>
<L>For had they found a Linguist half so good,</L>
<L>I make no question but the <HI>Tow'r</HI> had stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Obliging Sir! I love you, I profess,</L>
<L>"But wish you lik'd Retreat a little less;</L>
<L>"Spirits like you, believe me, shou'd be seen,</L>
<L>"And (like <HI>Ulysses)</HI> visit Courts, and Men.</L>
<L>"So much <HI>alone,</HI> (to speak plain Truth between us)</L>
<L>"You'll die of Spleen—Excuse me, <HI>Nunquam minus—</HI></L>
<L>But as for <HI>Courts,</HI> forgive me if I say,</L>
<L>No Lessons now are taught the <HI>Spartan</HI> way:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6"/>
Tho' in his Pictures Lust be full display'd,</L>
<L>Few are the Converts <HI>Aretine</HI> has made;</L>
<L>And tho' the Court show <HI>Vice</HI> exceeding clear,</L>
<L>None shou'd, by my Advice, learn <HI>Virtue</HI> there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this, entranc'd, he lifts his Hands and Eyes,</L>
<L>Squeaks like a high-stretch'd Lutestring, and replies:</L>
<L>"Oh 'tis the sweetest of all earthly things</L>
<L>"To gaze on Princes, and to talk of Kings!"</L>
<L>Then happy Man who shows the Tombs! said I,</L>
<L>He dwells amidst the Royal Family;</L>
<L>He, ev'ry Day, from <HI>King</HI> to <HI>King</HI> can walk,</L>
<L>Of all our <HI>Harries,</HI> all our <HI>Edwards</HI> talk,</L>
<L>And get by speaking Truth of Monarchs dead,</L>
<L>What few can of the living, <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Bread.</HI></L>
<L>"Lord! Sir, a meer <HI>Mechanick!</HI> strangely low,</L>
<L>"And coarse of Phrase—your <HI>English</HI> all are so.</L>
<L>"How elegant your <HI>Frenchman?</HI>—Mine, d'ye mean?</L>
<L>I have but one, I hope the Fellow's clean.</L>
<L>"Oh! Sir, politely well! nay, let me dye,</L>
<L>"Your only wearing is your <HI>Padua-soy."</HI></L>
<L>Not Sir, my only—I have better still,</L>
<L>And this, you see, is but my Dishabille—</L>
<L>Wild to get loose, his Patience I provoke,</L>
<L>Mistake, confound, object, at all he spoke.</L>
<L>But as coarse Iron, sharpen'd, mangles more,</L>
<L>And Itch most hurts, when anger'd to a Sore;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7"/>
So when you plague a Fool, 'tis still the Curse,</L>
<L>You only make the Matter worse and worse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He past it o'er; put on an easy Smile</L>
<L>At all my Peevishness, and chang'd his Style.</L>
<L>He asks, What <HI>News?</HI> I tell him of new Plays.</L>
<L>New Eunuchs, Harlequins, and Operas.</L>
<L>He hears; and as a Still, with Simples in it,</L>
<L>Between each Drop it gives, stays half a Minute;</L>
<L>Loth to enrich me with too quick Replies</L>
<L>By little, and by little, drops his Lies.</L>
<L>Meer <HI>Houshold Trash!</HI> of Birth-Nights, Balls and Shows,</L>
<L>More than ten <HI>Holingsheds,</HI> or <HI>Halls,</HI> or <HI>Stows.</HI></L>
<L>When the <HI>Qeen</HI> frown'd, or smil'd, he knows; and what</L>
<L>A subtle Minister may make of that?</L>
<L>Who sins with whom? who got his Pension <HI>Rug,</HI></L>
<L>Or quicken'd a Reversion by a <HI>Drug?</HI></L>
<L>Whose Place is <HI>quarter'd out,</HI> three Parts in four,</L>
<L>And whether to a Bishop, or a Whore?</L>
<L>Who, having lost his Credit, pawn'd his Rent,</L>
<L>Is therefore fit to have a <HI>Government?</HI></L>
<L>Who in the <HI>Secret,</HI> deals in Stocks secure,</L>
<L>And cheats th'unknowing Widow, and the Poor?</L>
<L>Who makes a <HI>Trust,</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> a Job,</L>
<L>And gets an Ac of Parliament to rob?</L>
<L>Why <HI>Turnpikes</HI> rose, and why no Cit, nor Clown</L>
<L>Can <HI>gratis</HI> see the <HI>Country,</HI> or the <HI>Town?</HI></L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8"/>
Shortly no Lad shall <HI>chuck,</HI> or Lady <HI>vole,</HI></L>
<L>But some excising Courtier will have Toll.</L>
<L>He tells what Strumpet Places sells for Life,</L>
<L>What 'Squire his Lands, what Citizen his Wife?</L>
<L>And last (which proves him wiser still than all)</L>
<L>What Lady's Face is not a whited Wall?</L>
<L>As one of <HI>Woodward</HI>'s Patients, sick and sore,</L>
<L>I puke, I nauseate,—yet he thrusts in more;</L>
<L>Shows <HI>Poland</HI>'s Int'rests, takes the <HI>Primate</HI>'s part,</L>
<L>And talks <HI>Gazettes</HI> and <HI>Post-Boys</HI> o'er by heart.</L>
<L>Like a big Wife at sight of loathsome Meat,</L>
<L>Ready to cast, I yawn, I sigh, I sweat:</L>
<L>Then as a licens'd Spy, whom nothing can</L>
<L>Silence, or hurt, he libels the <HI>Great Man;</HI></L>
<L>Swears every <HI>Place entail'd</HI> for Years to come,</L>
<L>In <HI>sure Succession</HI> to the Day of Doom:</L>
<L>He names the <HI>Price</HI> for ev'ry <HI>Office</HI> paid,</L>
<L>And says our <HI>Wars thrive ill,</HI> because <HI>delay'd;</HI></L>
<L>Nay hints, 'tis by Connivance of the Court,</L>
<L>That <HI>Spain</HI> robs on, and <HI>Dunkirk</HI>'s still a Port.</L>
<L>Not more Amazement seiz'd on <HI>Circe</HI>'s Guests,</L>
<L>To see themselves fall endlong into Beasts,</L>
<L>Than mine, to find a Subject staid and wise,</L>
<L>Already half turn'd Traytor by surprize.</L>
<L>I felt th'Infection slide from him to me,</L>
<L>As in the Pox, some give it, to get free;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="9"/>
And quick to swallow me, methought I saw</L>
<L>One of our Giant <HI>Statutes</HI> ope its Jaw!</L>
<L>In that nice Moment, as another Lye</L>
<L>Stood just a-tilt, the <HI>Minister</HI> came by.</L>
<L>Away he flies. He bows, and bows again;</L>
<L>And close as <HI>Umbra</HI> joins the dirty Train.</L>
<L>Not <HI>Naos</HI>'s self more impudently near,</L>
<L>When half his Nose is in his Patron's Ear.</L>
<L>I blest my Stars! but still afraid to see</L>
<L>All the Court fill'd with stranger things than he,</L>
<L>Run out as fast, as one that pays his Bail</L>
<L>And dreads more Actions, hurries from a Jail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bear me, some God! oh quickly bear me hence</L>
<L>To wholesome Solitude, the Nurse of Sense:</L>
<L>Here Contemplation prunes her ruffled Wings,</L>
<L>And the free Soul looks down to pity Kings.</L>
<L>Here still Reflection led on sober Thought,</L>
<L>Which Fancy colour'd, and a Vision wrought.</L>
<L>A <HI>Vision</HI> Hermits can to Hell transport,</L>
<L>And bring ev'n me to see the Damn'd at Court.</L>
<L>Not <HI>Danté</HI> dreaming all th'Infernal State,</L>
<L>Saw such a Scene of <HI>Envy, Sin,</HI> and <HI>Hate.</HI></L>
<L>Base Fear becomes the Guilty, not the Free;</L>
<L>Suits Tyrants, Plunderers, but suits not me.</L>

<L>Such waxen Noses, stately, staring things,</L>
