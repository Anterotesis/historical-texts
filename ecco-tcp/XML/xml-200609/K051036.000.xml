<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS being probably the last Time I may trespass on the Publick, I look up∣on myself in some Mea∣sure obliged to settle my Accounts with the World as an Au∣thor, before I make my <HI>Exit,</HI> by en∣deavouring to shew I have not always offended out of Presumption, Vanity, or Wantonness.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/>The first Time I adventured in Print, was on the Account of my great Ma∣ster and generous Friend, Dr. <HI>Pit∣cairn.</HI> He thought himself ill-used by some of his Brethren of the profession who then were at intestine War on the Subject of Fevers; and fancied the handsomest Way to bring them down, was to exhibit a more specious Account of this Disease, than any of them had shewn. His Business then in the Pra∣ctice of Physick was so great, as not to allow him sufficient Time for such a Work. Two others therefore, with myself, were joined to manage the Af∣fair: In which he was to cut and carve, and to add the practical Part. My Province was the Theory. I was then very young in the Profession, and living in the Country. But in a few Days I brought in my Part finished, as it now appears, under the Title of
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
<HI>The New Theory of Fevers.</HI> The others either suppress'd or forgot theirs, and mine, without the least Alteration, but in a few Words, was ordered for the Press. I could not resist the Com∣mands of my Friend; but would not suffer my Name to be put to it, being conscious it was a raw and unexpe∣rienced Performance. There are tho', some Thing sin it which may be of Use to Beginners, both as to the Method of philosophising on the animal Oecono∣my, and in the Account of the Man∣ner of the Operation of the greater Me∣dicines. The Foundations also and the Causes assigned for acute and slow Fe∣vers, I still think solid and just, and more particular and limited than those of any other Theory yet published. But it wants so much filing and finishing, so many Alterations and Additions, as would cost me more Labour and Pains than the writing a new Treatise on the
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
same Subject: So that out of mere La∣ziness and Inappetency, I have thrown it by as unripe Fruit, and suffered it to be as if it never had been.</P>
<P>My next Sally was in a Book of abstracted Geometry and Algebra, en∣titled, <HI>Methodus Fluxionum Inver∣sa,</HI> brought forth in Ambition and bred up in Vanity. There are some Things in it tolerable for the Time, when the Methods of Quadratures, the Mensu∣ration of Ratio's, and Transformation of Curves, into those of other Kinds, were not advanced to such Heights as they now are. But it is a long Time since I was forced to forgoe these barren and airy Studies for more substantial and commodious Speculations: Indulging and Rioting in these so exquisitely bewitch∣ing Contemplations, being only proper for publick Professors, and those born to Estates, and who are under no out∣ward
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
Necessities. Besides, to own a great but grievous Truth, tho' they may quicken and sharpen the Invention, streng∣then and extend the Imagination, im∣prove and refine the reasoning Faculty, and are of Use both in the necessary and the luxurious Refinement of me∣chanical Arts; yet having no Tendency to rectify the Will, sweeten the Tem∣per, or mend the Heart, they often leave a Stiffness, Positiveness, and Suf∣ficiency on weak Minds, much more pernicious to Society, and the Interests of the great End of our Being, than all the Advantages they bring them can recompence. They are indeed Edge-Tools, not to be trusted in the Hands of any, but those who have already acquired an humble Heart, a lowly Spirit, and a sober and teachable Temper For in o∣thers they are very apt to beget a se∣cret and refined Pride, an over-ween∣ing and over-bearing Vanity (the most
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
opposite Temper to the true Gospel∣Spirit, which, without Offence, I may suppose to be the best Disposition of Mind) that tempts them to presume on a Kind of Omniscience, in Respect of their Fellow-Creatures, that have not risen to their Elevation; and to set up for an Infallibility, or at least a de∣cisive Judgment, even in Matters which do not admit of a <HI>more</HI> or <HI>less</HI> (their proper Object) of which Kind what∣ever relates to the infinite Author of our Being most certainly is. Upon all which Accounts, conscious of my own Weakness, I have long since bid them an Adieu, farther than as they serve to amuse, or are useful in the absolute Necessities of Life.</P>
<P>The Defence of that Book against the learned and acute Mr. <HI>Abr. de Moivre,</HI> being written in a Spirit of Levity and Resentment, I most sin∣cerely
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
retract, and wish undone, so far as it is personal or peevish, and ask him and the World Pardon for it; as I do for the <HI>Defence</HI> of Dr. <HI>Pit∣cairn's Dissertations,</HI> and the <HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> against the late learned and ingenious Dr. <HI>Oliphant.</HI> I heartily condemn and detest all per∣sonal Reflexions, all malicious and un∣mannerly Turns, and all false and unjust Representations, as unbecoming Gentlemen, Scholars, and Christians; and disprove and undo both Performan∣ces, as far as in me lies, in every Thing that does not strictly and barely relate to the Argument.</P>
<P>The first Part of the <HI>Philosophi∣cal Principles,</HI> that of <HI>Natural Re∣ligion,</HI> consists merely of Discourses and Lectures of <HI>Natural Philoso∣phy,</HI> and of its Consequences on <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI> occasionally read or discoursed
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
to that most noble and great Person, the Duke of <HI>Roxburgh,</HI> who is now so great an Ornament to his Country, and his high Employments, to whom they were inscribed. I thought they might be of Use to other young Gentle∣men, who, while they were learning the Elements of natural Philosophy, might have thereby the Principles of natural Religion insensibly instilled in∣to them. And accordingly it has been and is still used for that Purpose at both Universities. Upon which Account, upon proper Occasions, I will not fail to improve it in all the new Discove∣ries in Experimental Philosophy, or in the final and natural Causes of Things as happen to be made, so as to leave it as little imperfect in its Kind as I possibly can.</P>
<P>The second Part of the <HI>Philoso∣phical Principles,</HI> to wit, that of
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
<HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> was added after∣ward, to shew, that all our Knowledge of Nature was by Analogy, or the Relations of Things only, and not their real Nature, Substance, or internal Principles: That from this Method of Analogy (the only Medium of hu∣mane Knowlege) we should be necessa∣rily led, to conclude the Attributes or Qualities of the supreme and absolute Infinite, were indeed analogous to the Properties or Qualities of finite Beings, but only in such a Manner as the Diffe∣rence between Infinite and Finite re∣quires; and that therefore, not being able to know precisely these Differences, we ought implicitely to believe without reasoning what is revealed to us concern∣ing the Nature of the infinite Being; or bring our Reason to submit to the Mysteries of Faith. How I have suc∣ceeded is not for me to determine. As the End was honest, I am secure the great
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
Principles and the fundamental Propo∣sitions are true and just. They may want a little farther clearing up and Explication: But as yet I have met with no Reason to retract any Thing material; else I should most certainly do it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Essay on the Gout and</HI> Bath <HI>Waters</HI> was brought forth by mere Accident. The first Draught being, as I there mentioned, only a Paper of Di∣rections for a Gentleman, my Friend and Patient, troubled with the Gout. It was enlarged upon different Occa∣sions, and published to prevent its be∣ing pyrated; several Copies having been given out to others in the same Circum∣stances. I have the Satisfaction to know from many different Hands, that it has benefited great Numbers of in∣firm and afflicted Persons; and shall
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
therefore go on to cultivate it as far as my poor Abilities will permit.</P>
<P>I am now come to this my last Pro∣duction; whose Origin was as casual as that of my former. My good and worthy Friend, the present Master of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> having been last Autumn at <HI>Bath</HI> for a Confirmation of his Health, at his Departure desired of me to draw up some Instructions in writing to direct him in the Conduct of his Health for the future, and in the Manner of sup∣porting his Spirits free and full, under the great Business he is engaged in. I was then in the Hurry of our Season, and could not so soon answer his Ex∣pectation, as his real Worth, and my sincere Esteem required. I thought my∣self therefore the more obliged assoon as I had Leisure, to exert myself to the uttermost in Obedience to his Com∣mands. At first I drew up most of
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
these Rules at the End of the several Chapters; but, upon Reflexion, thought it not Respect enough to his good Taste and Capacity to judge of the Reasons of Things, to prescribe him bare and dry Directions in Matters of so great Moment. I added therefore the philo∣sophical Account and Reasons of these Rules, which make up the Bulk of the Chapters themselves. He, out of his Love to his Fellow-Citizens (which is one shining Part of his Character, and which I ought to suppose has in this Instance only imposed on his better Judgment) desired they might be made publick. Upon which Account several Things have been since added, to make the whole of more general Use. If there∣fore any Thing in this Treatise be tole∣rable, or if any Person receive Benefit by it, they owe it entirely to that ex∣cellent Person, upon whose Account
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
solely it was undertaken, and at whose Request it is published.</P>
<P>I have indeed long and often ob∣served, with great Pity and Regret, many very learned, ingenious, and even religious Persons, who being weak and tender (as such generally are) have suf∣fered to the last Extremity for Want of a due Regimen of Diet, and other general Directions of Health, who had good Sense enough to understand the Force and Necessity of such Rules, valued Health sufficiently, and despised sen∣sual Gratifications for the Pleasures of the Mind so far, as to be able and willing to abstain from every Thing hurtful, deny themselves any Thing their Appetites craved, and to con∣form to any Rules for a tolerable De∣gree of Health, Ease, and Freedom of Spirits; and yet being ignorant how
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
to conduct themselves, from what to abstain and what to use, they have suffered even to mortal Agonies; who, had they been better directed and in∣structed, had pass'd their Lives in to∣lerable Ease and Quiet. It is for these, and these only, the following Treatise is designed. The Robust, the Luxurious, the Pot-Companions, the Loose, and the Abandoned, have here no Business; their Time is not yet come. But the Sickly and the Aged, the Studious and the Sedentary, Per∣sons of weak Nerves, and the Gen∣tlemen of the learned Professions, I hope, by the divine Blessing on the following Treatise, may be enabled to follow their Studies and Professions with greater Security and Applica∣tion, and yet preserve their Health and Freedom of Spirits more entire and to a longer Date. I am morally cer∣tain,
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
had I known and been as well satisfied of the Necessity of the Rules here laid down, thirty Years ago, as I am now, I had suffered less, and had had a greater Freedom of Spirits than I have enjoy'd. But every Thing is best as it has been, except the Er∣rors and Failings of our free Wills.</P>
<P>I know no useful Means of Health and Long Life I have omitted, nor any pernicious Custom I have not noted; and have given the plainest and most familiar Reasons I could urge for the Rules I have here laid down. Most of my Arguments (as they needs must) have risen out of the animal Functions and Oeconomy: And I have used as little Subtilty and Refinement in my Explications of these, as the present State of Natural Philosophy could ad∣mit. I have been often contented with
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
plain and obvious Facts to account for Appearances, and the Cautions thence deduced; when, according to the Hu∣mour of the present Age, I might have run into refined Speculations of Meta∣physicks, or Mathematicks; being con∣tented with the <HI>Crasso Modo philo∣sophari</HI>; because we shall never be able to search out the Works of the Almighty to Perfection, so as to pe∣netrate the internal Nature of Things.</P>
<P>I have consulted nothing but my own Experience and Observation on my own crazy Carcase and the Infir∣mities of others I have treated, in the following Rules, their Reasons and Philosophy, (so that if any Thing is borrowed, it has occurred to me as my own) but in so far as Authorities go to shorten philosophical Accounts. Not but that all systematick Writers in
<PB N="xvii" REF="19"/>
Physick, and many particular Authors, have treated the same Subject: But their Rules, besides that they are of∣ten inconsistent with Reason, or con∣trary to Experience, are so general, and express'd in so unlimited and un∣defined Terms, as leave little or no Certainty in them; when apply'd to particular Cases, they want the neces∣sary Precision and Exactness, and so became useless or perplexing: and last∣ly, when they come, (which is rarely to be found among them) to give the Reasons and Philosophy of their Di∣rections, they have not the Perspicuity and natural Way of convincing the in∣genious, sickly, and tender Sufferers, so necessary to make them chearfully and readily undergo such severe Re∣straints; which I take to be by far the most difficult Part of such a Work, and which I have laboured with my utmost Power to supply.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="20"/>I know not what may be the Fate and Success of this Performance; nor am I solicitous about it, being conscious the Design was honest, the Subject weighty, and the Execution the best my Time, my Abilities, and my Health would permit, which cannot bear the Labour of much Fileing and Finishing. Being careful not to incroach on the Province of the Physician, I have con∣cealed nothing my Knowledge could suggest to direct the Sufferer, in the best Manner I could, to preserve his Health and lengthen out his Life: And I have held out no false or delu∣sory Lights to lead him astray, or tor∣ment him unnecessarily.</P>
<P>If it were possible any Set of Men could be offended at my Performance, it might be my Brethren of the Pro∣fession,
<PB N="xix" REF="21"/>
for endeavouring to lessen the <HI>Materia Morbifica.</HI> But as this would be the most malicious, unjust, and unworthy Reflexion could be thrown on Scholars and Gentlemen of a liberal Education; so I never enter∣tain'd the most remote Vanity to think any Endeavour of mine would make so considerable a Change in the Na∣tion; especially when the Devil, the World, and the Flesh were on the o∣ther Side of the Question, which have stood their Ground even against the Rules of Life and Immortality brought to Light by the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this tedious Pre∣face without begging Pardon of the Reader for troubling him with my pri∣vate Matters. All I can say as an Apo∣logy is, that of whatsoever Indiffe∣rence my Concerns as an Author may
<PB N="xx" REF="22"/>
be to him, yet they were not so to me; this being the only Place and Time I may have to adjust them in, and it being the Heighth of my Ambi∣tion,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a common Say∣ing, That every Man past Forty is either a <HI>Fool</HI> or a <HI>Physician:</HI> It might have been as justly added, that he was a <HI>Divine</HI> too: For, as the World goes at present, there is not any Thing that the Generality of the better Sort of Mankind so lavishly and so unconcern∣edly throw away as <HI>Health,</HI> except <HI>eter∣nal Felicity.</HI> Most Men know when they
<PB N="2" REF="48"/>
are ill, but very few when they are well. And yet it is most certain, that 'tis ea∣sier to <HI>preserve</HI> Health than to <HI>recover</HI> it, and to <HI>prevent</HI> Diseases than to <HI>cure</HI> them. Towards the first, the Means are mostly in our own Power: Little else is required than to <HI>bear and forbear.</HI> But towards the latter, the Means are perplexed and uncertain; and for the Knowledge of them the far greatest Part of Mankind must apply to others, of whose Skill and Honesty they are in a great measure ignorant, and the Benefit of whose Art they can but conditionally and precautiously obtain. A crazy Con∣stitution, original weak Nerves, dear∣bought Experience in Things helpful and hurtful, and long Observation on the Complaints of others, who came for Relief to this universal Infirmary, <HI>BATH,</HI> have at last (in some measure) taught me some of the most effectual Means of preserving Health and prolonging Life in those who are <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>sickly,</HI> and labour under <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers. And I thought I could not spend my leisure Hours better than by putting together the most gene∣ral Rules for that Purpose, and setting them in the clearest and strongest Light I could, for the Benefit of those who
<PB N="3" REF="49"/>
may want them, and yet have not had such favourable Opportunities to learn them.</P>

<P>And that I might write with some Order and Connexion, I have cho∣sen to make some Observations and Re∣flections on the <HI>Nonnaturals</HI> (as they are called, possibly because that in their pre∣ternatural State they are eminently inju∣rious to human <HI>Constitutions</HI>; or more <HI>probably,</HI> because tho' they be necessary to the Subsistence of <HI>Man,</HI> yet in respect of <HI>him,</HI> they may be considered as <HI>ex∣ternal,</HI> or different from the <HI>internal</HI> Causes that produce <HI>Diseases</HI>) to wit, 1.

I shall not consider here how <HI>philosophi∣cally</HI> these <HI>Distinctions</HI> are made; they seem to me, the best general <HI>Heads</HI> for bringing in those <HI>Observations</HI> and <HI>Re∣flections</HI> I am to make in the following Pages.</P>

<P>The Reflection is not more common than just, That he who lives <HI>physically</HI> must live miserably. The Truth is, too great Nicety and Exactness about every minute Circumstance that may im∣pair our Health, is such a Yoke and Sla∣very, as no Man of a generous free Spi∣rit would submit to. 'Tis, as a <HI>Poet</HI> ex∣presses it, <HI>to die for fear of Dying.</HI> And to forbear or give over a just, charitable, or even generous Office of Life, from a too scrupulous Regard to Health, is un∣worthy of a <HI>Man,</HI> much more of a <HI>Chri∣stian.</HI> But then, on the other Hand, to cut off our Days by <HI>Intemperance, Indi∣scretion,</HI> and guilty <HI>Passions,</HI> to live mi∣serably for the sake of gratifying a <HI>sweet Tooth,</HI> or a brutal <HI>Itch</HI>; to die <HI>Martyrs</HI> to our <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Wantonness,</HI> is equal∣ly beneath the Dignity of <HI>human Nature,</HI> and contrary to the <HI>Homage</HI> we owe to the <HI>Author</HI> of our Being. Without some Degree of <HI>Health,</HI> we can neither be a∣greeable to <HI>ourselves,</HI> nor useful to our <HI>Friends</HI>; we can neither relish the Bles∣sings of <HI>divine</HI> Providence to us in <HI>Life,</HI> nor acquit ourselves of our <HI>Duties</HI> to our <HI>Maker,</HI> or our <HI>Neighbour.</HI> He that <HI>wantonly</HI> transgresseth the <HI>self-evident</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="51"/>
Rules of <HI>Health,</HI> is guilty of a Degree of <HI>Self-Murder</HI>; and an <HI>habitual</HI> Perse∣verance therein is direct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Self-Murder.</NOTE><HI>Suicide,</HI> and consequently, the greatest Crime he can commit against the <HI>Author</HI> of his Being; as it is slighting and despising the noblest <HI>Gift</HI> he could bestow upon him, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Means</HI> of making himself infinitely <HI>happy</HI>; and also as it is a <HI>treacherous</HI> for∣saking the <HI>Post,</HI> wherein his <HI>Wisdom</HI> has placed him, and thereby rendering him∣self incapable of answering the Designs of his <HI>Providence</HI> over him. The infi∣nitely wise <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> has so contrived <HI>Things,</HI> that the most remark∣able RULES of preserving LIFE and HEALTH are <HI>moral Duties</HI> commanded us, so truē it is, that <HI>Godliness has the Promises of this Life, as well as that to come.</HI></P>

<P>From Observations on Bleeding in <HI>Rheumatisms,</HI> and after catching Cold, 'tis evident, that the <HI>Air</HI> with its diffe∣rent <HI>Qualities,</HI> can alter and quite vitiate the whole <HI>Texture</HI> of the Blood and <HI>ani∣mal</HI> Juices: From the <HI>Palsies, Vertigoes, Vapours,</HI> and other <HI>nervous Affections,</HI> caused by <HI>Damps, Mines,</HI> and working on some <HI>Minerals,</HI> (<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Ramazini</HI> of the Diseases of Tradesmen.</NOTE>particularly <HI>Mer∣cury</HI>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. 3.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is, That when <HI>Gentlemen</HI> build <HI>Seats,</HI> they ought never to place them upon any high <HI>Hill,</HI> very near any great <HI>Confluence</HI> of Water, in the Neigh∣bourhood of any great <HI>Mines,</HI> or Beds of <HI>Minerals,</HI> nor on any swamp, marshy, or mossy Foundation; but either in a <HI>cham∣paign</HI> Country, or on the <HI>Side</HI> of a small Eminence, sheltered from the <HI>North</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="54"/>
<HI>East</HI> Winds, or upon a light gravelly Soil. The Nature of the Soil will be well known from the <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Herbs</HI> that grow on it, or rather more securely from the Nature of the <HI>Waters</HI> that spring out of it, which ought always to be <HI>sweet, clear, light, soft,</HI> and <HI>tastless.</HI> All high <HI>Mountains</HI> are damp, as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> observed at <HI>St. Helena,</HI> a moun∣tainous Place, where <HI>Damps</HI> fell so per∣petually in the Night time, that he was obliged to be every Moment wiping his <HI>Glasses,</HI> in making his <HI>Astronomical</HI> Observations. And where the <HI>Moun∣tains</HI> are high, the Inhabitants of them are forced to send their <HI>Furniture,</HI> in Winter, to the <HI>Valley,</HI> lest it should rot. And 'tis common to have it rain or snow on Mountains, when the Valleys below are clear, screne and dry. All great <HI>Hills</HI> are Nests of <HI>Minerals,</HI> and Covers (made of the prominent Earth) for <HI>Reservoirs</HI> of <HI>Rain-Water.</HI> The Clouds are but great <HI>Fleeces</HI> of rarified Water sailing in the <HI>Air,</HI> sometimes not many Yards above the <HI>champaign</HI> Country; and these high <HI>Hills</HI> intercepting them, they are com∣pressed into <HI>Dew</HI> and <HI>Rain,</HI> and are per∣petually drilling down the <HI>Crannies</HI> of

the Mountains into these <HI>Basins.</HI> Hence the <HI>Origin</HI> of <HI>Rivers, and fresh Water Springs.</HI> Besides that, these mountain∣ous Places, are always expos'd to high, and almost perpetual <HI>Winds.</HI> Where any great <HI>Concourse</HI> of Water is, the <HI>Air</HI> must needs be perpetually damp, because the <HI>Sun</HI> is perpetually straining from these <HI>Waters,</HI> moist <HI>Dews</HI> and <HI>Vapours</HI> thro' <HI>it.</HI> All great Nests of <HI>Minerals,</HI> or large <HI>Mines,</HI> must necessarily impregnate the <HI>Air,</HI> with their respective Qualities.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> the <HI>Winds</HI> that are most frequent, and most pernicious in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> are the <HI>Easterly,</HI> especially the <HI>North East</HI> Winds, which in the <HI>Win∣ter</HI> are the most <HI>piercing</HI> cold, in <HI>Summer</HI> the most <HI>parching</HI> hot.

And if any <HI>such</HI> Person, has been much exposed, or long abroad, in a <HI>Northerly</HI> or <HI>bleakish Easterly</HI> Wind, it will be very proper for him to drink down, going to Bed, a large Draught of warm Wa∣ter-gruel, or of warm small <HI>Mountain∣wine</HI> Whey, as an <HI>Antidote</HI> against the

<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is a <HI>Fluid,</HI> wherein Parts of all Kinds of Bodies swim as in Wa∣ter. But <HI>Air</HI> differs from <HI>Water</HI> in this, that the <HI>first</HI> is compressible into a lesser Compass, and smaller <HI>Volume,</HI> like a <HI>Fleece</HI> of <HI>Wool,</HI> either by its own <HI>Weight,</HI> or any other <HI>Force,</HI> which <HI>Weight</HI> or <HI>Force</HI> being removed, the <HI>Air</HI> imme∣diately recovers its former Bulk and Di∣mensions again, whereas no <HI>Force</HI> what∣ever can bring <HI>Water</HI> into narrower Bounds; that is, <HI>Air</HI> is extreamly <HI>ela∣stick</HI> and <HI>springy,</HI> but <HI>Water</HI> is not at all so. Yet the Parts of <HI>Air</HI> would seem to be <HI>grosser</HI> than the Parts of <HI>Water:</HI> For <HI>Water</HI> will get through a <HI>Bladder,</HI> and may be forced through the <HI>Pores</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI>; but <HI>Air</HI> will pass through neither. By this its <HI>elastick Force,</HI> the <HI>Air</HI> insi∣nuates
<PB N="13" REF="59"/>
itself into the patent <HI>Cavities</HI> of all <HI>animal</HI> Bodies; and the <HI>Infant,</HI> which never breathed before, assoon as it is exposed to this <HI>Element,</HI> has the little <HI>Bladders,</HI> whereof the <HI>Lungs</HI> consist, blown up into a <HI>perpendicular</HI> Erection on the Branches of the <HI>Wind-pipe</HI>; where∣by the Obstruction, from the Pressure of these <HI>Vesicles</HI> (arising from their being compressed together, and lying upon one another) being in some Measure taken off, the <HI>muscular Action</HI> of the right <HI>Ventricle</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI> is able to force the Blood through the <HI>Lungs</HI> into the left <HI>Ventricle.</HI> But these little <HI>Bladders,</HI> being thus <HI>inflated</HI> by an <HI>elastick Fluid,</HI> still press so far upon, and grind the grosser <HI>Particles</HI> of the Blood into more <HI>sizeable ones,</HI> that they may become small enough to <HI>circulate</HI> through the other <HI>capillary Vessels</HI> of the Body. This <HI>ela∣stick Air,</HI> pressing equally every Way round, by its <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Spring,</HI> shuts close the <HI>Scales</HI> of the <HI>Scarf-skin</HI> of healthy and strong Persons; so that it denies all <HI>Entrance</HI> to the <HI>nitrous</HI> and <HI>watry</HI> Mixture, contained in it, and thus becomes a Kind of <HI>Cold Bath,</HI> to them, and defends them from catching <HI>Cold:</HI> But in <HI>sickly, studious,</HI> and <HI>sedentary</HI> Peo∣ple,
<PB N="14" REF="60"/>
and those of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> where the <HI>Spring</HI> of the <HI>Coverlets</HI> and <HI>Scales,</HI> that defend the Mouths of the <HI>perspira∣tory Ducts</HI> is weak, the <HI>Perspiration</HI> lit∣tle or next to none at all, and the Blood <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>sizey</HI>; the <HI>nitrous</HI> and <HI>watry Particles</HI> of the <HI>Air</HI> get a ready and free <HI>Entrance,</HI> by these <HI>Ducts</HI> into the Blood, and by breaking the <HI>Globules</HI> thereof, <HI>coagulating</HI> and fixing its <HI>Fluidity,</HI> quite stop the <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and obstruct all the <HI>capillary</HI> Vessels, the <HI>cutaneous Glands,</HI> and those of the <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>alimentary</HI> Passages, when such Bodies are long ex∣posed to such an <HI>Air:</HI> And thus begets all these Disorders in the Body, that <HI>Air</HI> thus and thus <HI>poisoned,</HI> was shewn capa∣ble to produce. So long as the <HI>Perspi∣ration</HI> is <HI>strong, brisk,</HI> and <HI>full,</HI> 'tis im∣possible any of these Disorders should hap∣pen; because the <HI>Force</HI> of the <HI>perspira∣tory</HI> Steams outward, is greater than the <HI>Force</HI> whereby these <HI>noxious Mixtures</HI> enter; unless the Body be indiscreetly too long exposed, or the Action of the <HI>nitrous</HI> and <HI>watry Mixtures</HI> be extreme∣ly violent. Hence it comes to pass, that those who are very <HI>strong</HI> and <HI>healthy,</HI> and those who have <HI>drank strong Liquors</HI> so plentifully, as to have thereby a brisk
<PB N="15" REF="61"/>
<HI>Circulation</HI> and full <HI>Perspiration,</HI> seldom or never catch <HI>Cold.</HI> And this is the Reason why <HI>rich Foods</HI> and <HI>generous Wines,</HI> moderately used, become so ex∣cellent an <HI>Antidote</HI> in <HI>infectious</HI> and <HI>e∣pidemick</HI> Distempers; not only as they banish <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> but as they make so full and free a Stream of <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and maintain so active and brisk an <HI>At∣mosphere,</HI> as suffers no <HI>noxious Steams</HI> or <HI>Mixtures</HI> in the <HI>Air</HI> to come within it; but drives and beats off the Enemy to a Distance. But Persons of <HI>viscous, heavy Fluids,</HI> of <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>sizey Juices,</HI> of little or no <HI>Perspiration,</HI> such as ge∣nerally all <HI>studious, sedentary</HI> and <HI>sickly</HI> Persons are, but especially those that are subject to <HI>nervous</HI> Disorders, must neces∣sarily suffer under these <HI>poisonous Mixtures</HI> in the <HI>Air,</HI> if they do not cautiously and carefully fence against them, or take not a present Remedy and <HI>Antidote,</HI> when <HI>tainted.</HI> For besides the <HI>Air</HI> that gets through the <HI>perspiratory Ducts</HI> into the Blood, whenever we Eat, Drink, or Breath, we are taking into our Bodies, such <HI>Air</HI> as is about us. And when the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers are <HI>weak,</HI> as in such <HI>Persons,</HI> and the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the <HI>Food</HI> is too great, or its <HI>Quality</HI> too strong for

them, the <HI>Chyle</HI> is too gross, and the <HI>per∣spiratory</HI> Matter is stopped, because too large for these small <HI>Ducts</HI>; and this whole <HI>Mass,</HI> which in <HI>common</HI> Health is more than <HI>double</HI> of the gross <HI>Evacua∣tions, recoils</HI> in upon the <HI>Bowels,</HI> and becomes, as it were, <HI>Spears,</HI> and <HI>Darts,</HI> and <HI>Armour</HI> to the <HI>Air</HI> received from without; which being thus <HI>sharpened</HI> with the <HI>Salts</HI> of the <HI>unconcocted Food,</HI> to∣gether with its own <HI>elastick Force,</HI> pierces the Sides of the <HI>Vessels,</HI> and gets into all the <HI>Cavities</HI> of the Body, and be∣tween the <HI>Muscles</HI> and their <HI>Membranes,</HI> and there, in Time, brings forth <HI>hypo∣chondriack, hysterick, nervous,</HI> and <HI>va∣pourish</HI> Disorders, and all that <HI>black Train</HI> of <HI>Evils</HI> such Constitutions suffer under.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. 1.</HEAD>
<P>TO have our <HI>Food,</HI> that is, our Meat and Drink, as to <HI>Quan∣tity</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> duly regulated, and pre∣cisely adjusted to our <HI>concoctive Powers,</HI> would be of the utmost Consequence to <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life.</HI> Our Bodies re∣quire only a <HI>determinate Quantity</HI> there∣of, to supply the <HI>Expences</HI> of living: and a just Proportion of that to these would very probably preserve us from <HI>acute,</HI> most certainly from <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, and enable us to live, without much Sick∣ness and Pain, so long as our Constitu∣tions were originally made to <HI>last.</HI> The Sources of <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers are <HI>first</HI> Viscidity in the Juices, or the Over∣largeness of their constituent <HI>Particles,</HI> which not being sufficiently broken by the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers, stop or retard the <HI>Circulation</HI>; or, <HI>secondly,</HI> too great abun∣dance of sharp and acrimonious <HI>Salts,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="66"/>
whereby the Juices themselves are ren∣dered so <HI>corrosive,</HI> as to burst or wear out the Solids; or, <HI>thirdly,</HI> a <HI>Relaxa∣tion,</HI> or Want of a due <HI>Force</HI> and Sprin∣giness, in the Solids themselves. An Ex∣cess in <HI>Quantity</HI> begets the <HI>first,</HI> the <HI>ill Condition</HI> of our Meat and Drink the <HI>second,</HI> and <HI>both</HI> together, with Want of due Labour, the <HI>third.</HI></P>

<HEAD>§. 2.</HEAD>
<P>The Meat of <HI>England</HI> is gene∣rally <HI>animal</HI> Substances. The <HI>Animals</HI> themselves, from <HI>epidemick</HI> Causes, bad Food, Age, or other Infirmities, have their Diseases as well as <HI>human</HI> Crea∣tures: and these diseased <HI>Animals</HI> can never be proper or sound Food for Men. Adult <HI>Animals</HI> abound more in <HI>urinous Salts</HI> than young ones: Their Parts are more closely compacted, because more forcibly united; and so harder of Dige∣stion. 'Tis true, the great Distinction of the <HI>Fitness</HI> or <HI>Unfitness</HI> of the several Sorts of <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> for hu∣man Food, depends upon their <HI>original Make, Frame,</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> (and that can be found out only by Experience) as also upon the <HI>special</HI> Taste, <HI>Complexion, Tem∣perament,</HI> and <HI>Habits</HI> of the Person that feeds on them. But by the Help of these
<PB N="21" REF="67"/>
<HI>Three</HI> Principles, <HI>viz. First,</HI> That the <HI>Strength</HI> or Weakness of Cohesion of the Particles of fluid Bodies, depends up∣on their <HI>Bigness</HI> or <HI>Smallness</HI>; that is, the <HI>biggest</HI> Particles cohere more firmly, than the <HI>smaller,</HI> because more Parts come into Contact in large Bodies than small, and so their <HI>Union</HI> is greater. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the <HI>greater</HI> the Force [<HI>Momentum</HI>] is, with which two Bodies meet, the stronger is their Cohesion, and the more difficult their Separation. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that <HI>Salts,</HI> being comprehended by plain <HI>Sur∣faces,</HI> being <HI>hard,</HI> and in all Changes recovering their Figure, unite the most firmly of any Bodies whatsoever: Their plain <HI>Surfaces</HI> bring many Points into <HI>Contact</HI> and <HI>Union:</HI> Their <HI>Hardness</HI> and constant <HI>Figure</HI> make them <HI>durable</HI> and <HI>unalterable</HI>; and thereby the <HI>active Prin∣ciples,</HI> and the Origin of the Qualities of Bodies; and when they approach with∣in the <HI>Sphere</HI> of one another's <HI>Activity,</HI> they firmly unite in <HI>Clusters</HI>; all which make the Separation of their original <HI>Particles</HI> the more difficult. I say, from these <HI>three Principles,</HI> we may in gene∣ral compare the Easiness or Difficulty of digesting (that is, breaking into small Parts) the several Sorts of <HI>Vegetables</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="68"/>
and <HI>Animals,</HI> one with another; and so discover their <HI>Fitness</HI> or <HI>Unfitness</HI> for becoming Food for tender and <HI>valetudi∣nary</HI> Persons. 
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. All other Things being supposed equal, those <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals,</HI> that come to <HI>Maturity</HI> the soonest, are <HI>lightest</HI> of <HI>Digestion.</HI> Thus the Spring <HI>Vegetables,</HI> as <HI>Asparagus, Straw-berries,</HI> and some Sorts of <HI>Sallading,</HI> are more easily digested than <HI>Pears, Apples, Pea∣ches,</HI> and <HI>Nectarines</HI>; because they have less of the <HI>solar</HI> Fire in them; their Parts are united by a weaker Heat; that is, with less <HI>Velocity,</HI> and abound less in, nay scarce have any strong and fixed <HI>Salts.</HI> Among the <HI>Animals,</HI> the com∣mon Poultry, <HI>Hares, Sheep, Kids, Rab∣bets, &amp;c.</HI> who in the same, or a few Years come to their <HI>Maturity</HI> (that is, to propagate their <HI>Species</HI>) are much more tender and readily digested than <HI>Cows,</HI> Horses, or Asses, (were these last in use for Food, as they have been in <HI>Famine</HI>) <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the Reason already given, be∣cause their Parts cohere less firmly. And it is observable, of the <HI>Vegetables,</HI> which are longest a ripening, that is, whose <HI>Juices</HI> have most of the <HI>solar</HI> Rays
<PB N="23" REF="69"/>
in them, that their <HI>fermented Juices</HI> yield the strongest <HI>vinous</HI> Spirits; as Grapes, Elder-berries, and the like: and of the <HI>Animals</HI> that are longest in coming to <HI>Maturity,</HI> that their <HI>Juices</HI> yield the most rank and most <HI>foetid</HI> urinous <HI>Salts.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Other Things supposed <HI>equal,</HI> the <HI>larger</HI> and <HI>bigger</HI> the <HI>Vegetable</HI> or <HI>Ani∣mal</HI> is, in its Kind, the <HI>stronger</HI> and the <HI>harder</HI> to digest is the Food made thereof. Thus a large <HI>Onion, Apple,</HI> or <HI>Pear,</HI> and large <HI>Beef</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> are <HI>harder</HI> to di∣gest than the <HI>lesser</HI> ones, of the same Kind; not only, as their Vessels being stronger and more <HI>elastick,</HI> their Parts are brought together with a <HI>greater</HI> Force; but also, because the <HI>Qualities</HI> are pro∣portionably more intense in great Bodies of the same Kind: Thus, other Things being equal, a <HI>greater</HI> Fire is proportion∣ably more intensely hot, than a lesser one; and the Wine contained in a larger Vessel becomes stronger than that con∣tained in a lesser; and consequently the Juices of larger <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> are more rank than the Juices of smaller ones of the same Kind.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="24" REF="70"/>3. Other Things being equal, The pro∣per Food appointed for <HI>Animals</HI> by Na∣ture, is easier digested than the <HI>Animals</HI> themselves; those <HI>Animals</HI> that live on <HI>Vegetables,</HI> than those that live on <HI>Ani∣mals</HI>; those that live on <HI>Vegetables</HI> or <HI>Animals,</HI> that soonest come to <HI>Maturi∣ty,</HI> than those that live on such as are longer a ripening. Thus <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Eggs</HI> are lighter of Digestion than the Flesh of <HI>Beasts</HI> or <HI>Birds</HI>; <HI>Pullets</HI> and <HI>Turkies,</HI> than <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Geese</HI>; and <HI>Partridge,</HI> and <HI>Pheasant</HI> are <HI>lighter</HI> than <HI>Woodcock</HI> or <HI>Snipe</HI>; because these last, being <HI>long-bil∣led,</HI> suck only <HI>animal</HI> Juices; and for the Reasons already given, <HI>Grass Beef</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> are lighter than <HI>stall-fed Ox∣en</HI> and <HI>Sheep.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. All Things else being alike, <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Sea-Animals</HI> are <HI>harder</HI> to digest than <HI>Land-Animals</HI>; because universal∣ly their Food is other <HI>Animals,</HI> and the <HI>Salt Element</HI> in which they live compacts their Parts more firmly; <HI>Salts</HI> having a stronger Power of <HI>Cohesion</HI> than other Bodies. And for the same Reason, <HI>Salt Water Fish</HI> is harder to digest than <HI>fresh</HI> Water. Thus the <HI>Sea Tortoise</HI> is harder
<PB N="25" REF="71"/>
to digest than the <HI>Land Tortoise</HI>; and <HI>Sturgeon</HI> and <HI>Turbit,</HI> than <HI>Trout</HI> or <HI>Perch.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Other Things being equal, <HI>Vegeta∣bles</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> that abound in an <HI>oily, fat,</HI> and <HI>glutinous</HI> Substance, are <HI>harder</HI> to digest, than those of a <HI>dry, fleshy, fibrous</HI> Substance; because <HI>oily</HI> and <HI>fat</HI> Substan∣ces clude the Force and Action of the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers; and their Parts at∣tract one another, and unite more strong∣ly than other Substances do, (except Salts) as Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s first <HI>English</HI> Edition of Light and Colours.</NOTE> observes. Their <HI>Softness</HI> and <HI>Humidity</HI> relaxes and weak∣ens the Force of the Stomach, and the Fat and Oil itself is shut up in little <HI>Bladders,</HI> that are with Difficulty broken. Thus <HI>Nuts</HI> of all kinds pass through the <HI>Guts,</HI> almost untouched: <HI>Olives</HI> are har∣der to digest than <HI>Pease</HI>; <HI>fat</HI> flesh Meat, than the <HI>lean</HI> of the same. <HI>Carp, Tench, Salmon, Eel,</HI> and <HI>Turbit,</HI> are much harder to digest than <HI>Whiting, Perch, Trout,</HI> or <HI>Haddock.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals,</HI> all Things else being alike, whose Substance is <HI>white,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="72"/>
or inclining to the <HI>lighter</HI> Colours, are <HI>lighter</HI> to digest, than those whose <HI>Substance</HI> is <HI>redder, browner,</HI> or inclining towards the more flaming Colours; not only be∣cause the Parts that reflect <HI>white,</HI> and the lighter Colours are lesser in Bulk than those that reflect the more flaming Colours<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the just quoted Author.</NOTE>; but also because those of the more flaming Colours abound more with urinious Salts. Thus <HI>Turnips, Parsnips,</HI> and <HI>Potatoes,</HI> are lighter than <HI>Carrots, Skirrets,</HI> and <HI>Beet-Raves. Pullet, Tur∣key, Pheasant,</HI> and <HI>Rabbet,</HI> are lighter than <HI>Duck, Geese, Woodcock,</HI> and <HI>Snipe. Whiting, Flounder, Perch,</HI> and <HI>Soal,</HI> are lighter than <HI>Salmon, Sturgeon, Herring,</HI> and <HI>Mackarel. Veal</HI> and <HI>Lamb</HI> is lighter than <HI>Red</HI> or <HI>Fallow</HI> Deer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Lastly,</HI> All other Things being e∣qual, <HI>Vegetables</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> of a <HI>strong, poignant, aromatick</HI> and hot Taste, are <HI>harder</HI> to digest than those of a <HI>milder, softer,</HI> and more <HI>insipid</HI> Taste. High Re∣lish comes from abundance of Salts: A∣bundance of Salts supposes <HI>adult Ani∣mals,</HI> and such as are long a coming to

<P>There is nothing more certain, than that the greater Superiority the <HI>con∣coctive</HI> Powers have, over the <HI>Food,</HI> or the stronger the <HI>concoctive Powers</HI> are, in regard of the Things to be <HI>concocted</HI>; the <HI>finer</HI> the <HI>Chyle</HI> will be, the <HI>Circula∣tion</HI> the more free, and the <HI>Spirits</HI> more lightsome; that is, the better will the Health be. Now from these general Propositions, taking in their own parti∣cular <HI>Complexion</HI> and <HI>Habits, vale∣tudinary, studious,</HI> or <HI>contemplative</HI> Per∣sons may easily fix upon these particular <HI>vegetable</HI> or <HI>animal</HI> Foods, that are fit∣test for them. And if any Error should be committed, 'tis best to err on the safest Side, and rather chuse those Things that are under our <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers, than those that are above them. And in the Choice of <HI>Animals</HI> for our Food, we
<PB N="28" REF="74"/>
must not pass over the Manner of fatten∣ing and fitting them up for the Table. About <HI>London</HI> we can scarce have any, but cramm'd <HI>Poultry,</HI> or <HI>stall-fed</HI> Butche∣ry Meat. It were sufficient to disgust the stoutest Stomach, to see the foul, gross, and nasty <HI>Manner,</HI> in which, and the <HI>fetid,</HI> putrid and unwholesome <HI>Ma∣terials,</HI> with which they are fed. Perpe∣tual Foulness and Cramming, gross Food and Nastiness, we know, will putrify the <HI>Juices</HI> and mortify the <HI>muscular</HI> Substance of <HI>human</HI> Creatures; and sure they can do no less in Brute <HI>Animals,</HI> and thus make even our Food Poison. The same may be said of hot Beds, and forcing <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Vegetables.</HI> The only Way of having sound and healthful <HI>animal</HI> Food, is to leave them to their own <HI>na∣tural Liberty,</HI> in the free Air, and their own proper <HI>Element,</HI> with Plenty of Food, and due Cleanness, and a Shelter from the Injuries of the Weather, when they have a Mind to retire to it. I add nothing about <HI>Cookery:</HI> Plain Roasting and Boiling is as high, as <HI>valetudinary, tender, studious,</HI> and <HI>contemplative</HI> Per∣sons, or those who would preserve their Health, and lengthen out their Days, ought to presume on. <HI>Made</HI> Dishes, <HI>rich</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="75"/>
<HI>Soop, high Sauces, Baking, Smoaking, Salting,</HI> and <HI>Pickling,</HI> are the Inventions of <HI>Luxury,</HI> to force an unnatural Appe∣tite, and encrease the <HI>Load,</HI> which Na∣ture, without Incentives from ill Habits, and a vicious Palate, will of itself make more than sufficient for <HI>Health and long Life. Abstinence</HI> and proper <HI>Evacua∣tions,</HI> due <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> will al∣ways recover a decayed <HI>Appetite,</HI> so long as there is any Strength and <HI>Fund</HI> in Na∣ture to go upon. And 'tis scarce allow∣ble to provoke an Appetite, with medi∣cinal Helps, but where the <HI>digestive</HI> Fa∣culties have been spoiled and ruined by acute or tedious <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers.

<P>The next Consideration is the <HI>Quantity</HI> of Food that is necessary to support Nature, without overloading it, in a due Plight: That is indeed various, according to the <HI>Age, Sex, Nature, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> the Party is of, and the <HI>Exercise</HI> he uses. In these <HI>Nor∣thern</HI> Countries, the Coldness of the <HI>Air,</HI> the <HI>Strength</HI> and large Stature of

People, demand larger Supplies than in the <HI>Eastern</HI> and warmer Countries. Young growing Persons, and those of great Strength and large Stature, require more than the Aged, Weak, and Slender. But Persons of all Sorts will live more heal∣thy and longer by universal <HI>Temperance,</HI> than otherwise. And some general Ob∣servations on the Quantity Persons of different Nations and Conditions, have lived on, healthy, and to a great Age, may give some Assistance to <HI>valetudina∣ry</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> Persons, to adjust the due <HI>Quantity</HI> necessary for them.</P>

<P>Our Northern Climate, as I said from the Purity and Coldness of the Air, which bracing the Fibres, makes the <HI>Ap∣petite</HI> keener, and the Action of Dige∣stition stronger; and from the Labour and Strength of the People, which makes the Expences of living more, will neces∣sarily require a greater Quantity of Food. Yet 'tis wonderful in what Sprightliness, Stength, Activity, and fredom of Spirits, a low Diet, even here, will preserve those that have habituated themselves to it. <HI>Buchanan</HI> informs us, of one <HI>Lau∣rence</HI> who preserved himself to 140, by the mere Force of Temperance and La∣bour. <HI>Spotswood</HI> mentions one <HI>Kenti∣gern</HI> (afterwards called St. <HI>Mongah,</HI> or <HI>Mungo,</HI> from whom the Famous Well in <HI>Wales</HI> is named) who lived to 185 Years, tho' after he came to the Years of Understanding, he never tasted

<P>Most of all the <HI>chronical</HI> Diseases, the <HI>Infirmities</HI> of old Age, and the <HI>short</HI> Periods of the Lives of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> are owing to <HI>Repletion.</HI> This is evident from hence; because <HI>Evacuation</HI> of one Kind or another is <HI>nine</HI> Parts of <HI>ten</HI> in their Remedy: For not only <HI>Cupping, Bleed∣ing, Blistering, Issues, Purging, Vomit∣ing,</HI> and <HI>Sweating,</HI> are manifest <HI>Evacua∣tions,</HI> or Drains to draw out what has been superfluously taken down; but even <HI>Abstinence, Exercise, Alteratives, Cor∣dials, Bitters,</HI> and <HI>Alexipharmicks,</HI> are but several means to dispose the gross Humours to be more readily evacuated by insensible <HI>Perspiration</HI>; that new and well concocted <HI>Chyle,</HI> and sweet com∣minuted Juices, may take their Place to restore the Habit.

<P>I advise therefore all Gentlemen of a <HI>sedentary Life,</HI> and of <HI>learned</HI> Pro∣fessions, to use as much <HI>Abstinence</HI> as possibly they can, consistent with the Pre∣servation of their <HI>Strength</HI> and Freedom of <HI>Spirits:</HI> Which ought to be done as soon as they find any <HI>Heaviness, Inquie∣tudes,</HI> restless Nights, or Aversion to Ap∣plication; either by lessening one half of their usual Quantity of <HI>animal</HI> Food and <HI>strong</HI> Liqours, 'till such Time as they regain their wonted Freedom and Indo∣lence; or by living a due Time wholly upon <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet, such as <HI>Sago, Rice, Pudding,</HI> and the like, and drinking on∣ly a little Wine and Water. And if they would preserve their <HI>Health</HI> and Consti∣tution, and <HI>lengthen</HI> out their Days; they must either inviolably live low (or <HI>mai∣gre,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call it) a Day or two in the Week; or once a Week, Fort∣night, or Month at farthest, take some <HI>domestick</HI> Purge, which shall require nei∣ther <HI>Diet,</HI> nor keeping at <HI>Home</HI>; but may at once strengthen the Bowels, and discharge superfluous <HI>Humours.</HI> Of this Kind are a Dose (6 or 7) of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Pills; half a Dram of the <HI>Pilulae Stoma∣chicae cum Gummi,</HI> with three or four
<PB N="37" REF="83"/>
Grains of <HI>Diagryd,</HI> mixt; half a Dram of the <HI>Pilulae Ruffi</HI>; two Ounces of <HI>Hiera Piera,</HI> with one Dram of the Sy∣rup of <HI>Buckthorn</HI>; two or three Ounces of <HI>Elixir Salutis</HI>; or (what I prefer be∣fore all these) this Preparation of <HI>Rhu∣barb:</HI></P>

<P>Those who have written about <HI>Health</HI> have given many <HI>Rules,</HI> where∣by to know when any Person has exceed∣ed at a <HI>Meal:</HI> I think, there needs but this <HI>short</HI> one, which is; If any Man has eat or drank so much, as renders him unfit for the <HI>Duties</HI> and <HI>Studies</HI> of his Profession (after an Hour's sitting quiet to carry on the Digestion;) he has over∣done. I mean only of those of <HI>learned</HI> Professions and <HI>studious</HI> Lives; for those of <HI>mechanical</HI> Employments must take the Body, the other Part of the <HI>com∣pound,</HI> into Consideration. If <HI>tender</HI> People, and those of learned Professions would go by this <HI>Rule,</HI> there would be little Use for <HI>Physick</HI> or <HI>Physicians</HI> in <HI>chronical</HI> Cases. Or if they would but eat only one Part of <HI>animal</HI> Food, at the great Meal, and make the other two of <HI>vegetable</HI> Food; and drink only Water

with a Spoonful of Wine, or clear small Beer; their Appetites would be a suffi∣cient Rule to determine the Quantity of their Meat and Drink. But <HI>Variety</HI> of Dishes, the <HI>luxurious</HI> Artfulness of <HI>Cook∣ery,</HI> and swallowing <HI>rich Wine</HI> after eve∣ry Bit of Meat, so lengthen out the <HI>Ap∣petite</HI>; the Fondness of Mothers, and the Cramming of Nurses have so stretched the Capacities of Receiving, that there is no Security from the <HI>Appetite</HI> among the better Sort. 'Tis amazing to think how Men of <HI>Voluptuousness, Laziness,</HI> and <HI>poor Constitutions,</HI> should imagine themselves able to carry off <HI>Loads</HI> of high-seasoned Foods, and inflammatory Liquors, without Injury or Pain; when Men of <HI>mechanick</HI> Employments, and <HI>rubust Constitutions,</HI> are scarcely able to live healthy and in Vigour to any great Age, on a simple, low, and almost <HI>vege∣table</HI> Diet.</P>

<P>Since then our <HI>Appetites</HI> are deceitful, and <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure</HI> trou∣blesome and singular; we must have Re∣course to a <HI>Rule</HI> independent of our <HI>Sen∣sations,</HI> and free from unnecessary Trou∣ble and Pain. To answer which, I know nothing but Eating and Drinking by our
<PB N="40" REF="86"/>
<HI>Eye.</HI> that is, determining first of all ei∣ther by <HI>Weight</HI> or <HI>Measure,</HI> or by par∣ticular Observation or <HI>Experiment,</HI> the Bulk, or Number of Mouthfuls of Flesh Meat, and the Number of Glasses of strong Liquors, <HI>under</HI> which we are best; and then by our <HI>Eye</HI> determining an equal Quantity at all Times for the future: Thus the two Wings of a middling <HI>Pul∣let,</HI> or one Wing and both Legs; three Ribs of a middling Neck of <HI>Mutton,</HI> two middling Slices of a Leg or Shoulder, throwing away the <HI>Fat</HI> and the <HI>Skin</HI>; somewhat less of <HI>Beef,</HI> may be sufficient for Flesh Meat, at the great Meal. For we are so wisely contrived, that our Food need not be adjusted to <HI>mathematical</HI> Points: A little over or under will make no Difference in our Health. As for <HI>Pork,</HI> and all Kinds of <HI>Hog</HI>'s Flesh, I think they ought to be forbidden <HI>vale∣tudinary</HI> and studious People, as they were the <HI>Jews:</HI> They feed the foulest of any Creature, and their Juices are the <HI>rankest</HI>; their Substance the most <HI>sur∣feiting,</HI> and they are the most subject to cutaneous Diseases and Putrefaction, of any Creature; insomuch, that in the Time of a <HI>Plague,</HI> or any <HI>epidemical</HI> Di∣stemper, they are universally destroyed
<PB N="41" REF="87"/>
by all wise Nations, as the <HI>Southern</HI> Peo∣ple do mad Dogs in the hot Months. The same Censure I should pàss upon all <HI>Fish.</HI> Most <HI>Fish</HI> live in a <HI>saltish</HI> Element, and come only into <HI>fresh Water</HI> Rivers, for the Quietness and Conveniency of bringing forth their young ones. This makes their Parts more closely united and harder of Digestion. Besides, as I have before observed, they feed upon one a∣nother, and their <HI>Juices</HI> abound with a <HI>Salt</HI> that corrupts the <HI>Blood,</HI> and breeds <HI>chronical</HI> Diseases. And 'tis always ob∣servable, that those who live much on <HI>Fish</HI> are infected with the <HI>Scurvy, cuta∣neous Eruptions,</HI> and the other Diseases of a <HI>foul</HI> Blood. And every Body finds himself more thirsty and heavy than usual after a full Meal of <HI>Fish,</HI> let them be ever so fresh; and is generally forced to have Recourse to <HI>Spirits</HI> and distilled Liquors to carry them off: So that it is become a <HI>Proverb,</HI> among those that live much upon them, that <HI>Brandy</HI> is <HI>Latin</HI> for <HI>Fish.</HI> Besides, that after a full Meal of Fish, even at Noon, one never sleeps so sound the ensuing Night; as is certain from constant Observation. These few Hints may serve the <HI>valetudinary</HI> Person, in a gross Manner, to judge by
<PB N="42" REF="88"/>
the <HI>Eye</HI> the <HI>Quantity</HI> of solid Flesh Meat he takes or ought to take down: For I judge the mentioned Quantities to be ra∣ther a little under than over <HI>eight Ounces.</HI> As to <HI>Broths, Soops,</HI> and <HI>Jellies,</HI> if they be strong, I account them equal in <HI>Nou∣rishment</HI> and harder to digest than the same Weight of solid Flesh Meat; and three or four common Spoonfuls, atmost, make an <HI>Ounce</HI> in Weight in Liquids; and about double the Number of Bits commonly swallowed at once make the same Weight in solid Flesh Meat; for Exactness is not here requisite.</P>

<P><HI>Drink</HI> is the other Part of our Food.

<HI>mixt</HI> and <HI>artificial</HI> Liquors had never been invented.

is now become as common as <HI>Water</HI>; and the <HI>better Sort</HI> scarce ever dilute their Food with any other Liquor.

Those whose Appetite and Digestion is good and entire, never want strong Liquors to supply <HI>Spirits:</HI> Such <HI>Spirits</HI> are too <HI>vo∣latile</HI> and fugitive for any solid or useful Purposes in Life.

more <HI>exquisite,</HI> their <HI>Appetites</HI> less <HI>unruly,</HI> and their <HI>Health</HI> more uninterrupted, than any other <HI>natural Cause</HI> could have pro∣duced.

Nothing is more ridiculous than the com∣mon <HI>Plea</HI> for continuing in drinking on, large <HI>Quantities</HI> of <HI>spirituous Liquors</HI>; <HI>viz.</HI> Because they have been accustomed so to do, and they think it <HI>dangerous</HI> to leave it off, all of a sudden. It were as reasonable for him that is fallen into the <HI>Fire</HI> or <HI>Water</HI> to lie there, because of the Danger of removing him suddenly. For neither <HI>Element</HI> will destroy him more certainly, before his Time, than wal∣lowing in <HI>strong Liquors.</HI> If the <HI>Quan∣tity</HI> of strong Liquors they have been ac∣customed to, may be supposed prejudicial to their <HI>Health,</HI> or to introduce <HI>noxious Humours</HI> into the <HI>Habit</HI>; the sooner a Stop be put to it, the better.

<P>A great Mistake committed in this Affair is, that most People think the only <HI>Remedy</HI> for <HI>Gluttony</HI> is <HI>Drunken∣ness,</HI> or that the Cure of a <HI>Surfeit</HI> of <HI>Meat</HI> is a <HI>Surfeit</HI> of <HI>Wine:</HI> Than which nothing can be more false, or contrary to Nature; for, <HI>'tis lighting,</HI> as the Say∣ing is, <HI>the Candle at both Ends.</HI> For, first of all, <HI>Wine</HI> and all other strong Li∣quors are as hard to digest, and require as much <HI>Labour</HI> of the <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers, as <HI>strong Food</HI> itself.

People who drink only <HI>Water,</HI> or weak <HI>small Beer,</HI> shall be able to eat and digest almost double of what they could, did they drink <HI>strong Liquors</HI> at their <HI>Meals,</HI> as every one that pleases may <HI>ex∣perience. Water</HI> is the only universal Dissolvent or <HI>Menstruum,</HI> and the most certain Diluter of all Bodies proper for Food; tho' there are a great many that <HI>spirituous Liquors</HI> not only will not dis∣solve, but will <HI>harden,</HI> and make more <HI>undigestible</HI>; especially the <HI>Salts</HI> of Bo∣dies, wherein their <HI>active Qualities,</HI> that is, those which can do most <HI>Harm</HI> to <HI>hu∣man Constitutions,</HI> consist. And I have known Men of <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>tender Consti∣tutions,</HI> who could neither eat nor di∣gest upon drinking of <HI>Wine,</HI> who, by drinking at Meals common <HI>Water</HI> heat∣ed, have recovered their <HI>Appetites</HI> and <HI>Digestion,</HI> have thriven and grown plump. 'Tis true <HI>strong Liquors,</HI> by their <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Stimulation</HI> on the <HI>Organs</HI> of Con∣coction, by encreasing the <HI>Velocity</HI> of the Motion of the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and thereby quick∣ening the other <HI>animal Functions,</HI> will carry off the Load that lies upon the <HI>Stomach,</HI> with more present Chearful∣ness: Yet, besides the future Damages of such a <HI>Quantity</HI> of <HI>Wine,</HI> to the <HI>Stomach</HI>

<P>Another <HI>Mistake</HI> I shall ob∣serve, is the extreme Fondness Persons of the <HI>better Sort</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> have lately run into, for the strong and <HI>high Country Wines.</HI> I can think of no Reason for this, but the very ho∣nest one the <HI>Vulgar</HI> give for drinking <HI>Brandy:</HI> that they get sooner drunk on it. For surely the middling lighter Wines, <HI>inflame</HI> the <HI>animal</HI> Juices less, go more easily off the <HI>Stomach,</HI> and afford more Room for long <HI>Conversation</HI> and Chearfulness. <HI>Excess</HI> in them, gives less Pain, and is sooner remedied.

hot enough for them. People who have any Regard for their <HI>Health</HI> or <HI>Lives,</HI> ought to tremble at the first <HI>Cravings,</HI> for such poysonous Liquors. <HI>Strong Waters</HI> should never be taken but by the <HI>Direction</HI> of a <HI>Physician,</HI> or in the <HI>Agonies</HI> of <HI>Death.</HI> For when Per∣sons arrive at that State, that they become necessary to their <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> of Spirits; they may be justly reckoned a∣mong the <HI>Dead,</HI> both as to the short Time they have to live, and the little Use they can be of either to themselves or Mankind.

<P>Next to <HI>Drams,</HI> no Liquor de∣serves more to be stigmatized and banish∣ed the Repasts of the <HI>Tender, Valetudi∣nary,</HI> and <HI>Studious,</HI> than PUNCH. 'Tis a Composition of such Parts, as not one of them is <HI>salutary,</HI> or kindly to such <HI>Constitutions,</HI> except the pure Element in it. The principal <HI>Ingredient</HI> is <HI>Rum, Arrack, Brandy,</HI> or <HI>Malt Spirits,</HI> as they are called, all of them raised by the <HI>Fire,</HI> from the <HI>fermented Juices</HI> of Plants, brought from <HI>Southern</HI> Coun∣tries, or which have longest born the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> in our own <HI>Climate:</HI> And 'tis observable, that every Thing that has past the <HI>Fire,</HI> so that it has had due Time to divide and penetrate its Parts, as far as it possibly can, retains a <HI>caustick, corrosive,</HI> and burning <HI>Quality</HI> ever afterwards. This is evident from the <HI>fiery</HI> and <HI>burning Touch</HI> and <HI>Taste</HI> of new-drawn <HI>Spirits,</HI> as also from the <HI>burn∣ing</HI> of <HI>Lime-stone,</HI> which, tho' extin∣guish'd by Boiling Water, does ever after retain its heating and drying <HI>Quality,</HI> as appears from the great Use of <HI>Lime-Wa∣ter,</HI> in drying up all <HI>humid</HI> Sores, when given inwardly by itself, or compounded
<PB N="56" REF="104"/>
with <HI>sudorific</HI> Woods and Roots, and from its <HI>Success</HI> in outward Applications for the same Purposes. And tho' Time may in some Measure get the better of this, in its sensible and obvious Operations; yet since <HI>Water</HI> is a grosser Body than <HI>Fire,</HI> or <HI>Flame,</HI> it never can penetrate it so far as quite to extinguish its inmost <HI>Heat</HI>; espe∣cially if we consider, that <HI>Spirits</HI> are but an <HI>Accumulation</HI> of fine <HI>Salts</HI> and light <HI>Oil,</HI> compacted together into the smallest <HI>Vo∣lume</HI>; the <HI>first</HI> whereof is so hard and solid, as naturally to retain their Heat the longest, into which <HI>Water</HI> cannot enter; the other, <HI>to wit</HI> the <HI>Oyle,</HI> is so inflamable, that it most readily receives <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> and defends the <HI>Salts</HI> from the Power of the <HI>Water</HI> over them. And in the continued <HI>Distillation</HI> of Spi∣rits, this Action of the <HI>Fire</HI> is so strong, as to reduce them to liquid <HI>Flames</HI> at last, which will of themselves evaporate in visible <HI>Flames</HI> and <HI>Fumes.</HI> The other principal Part of the <HI>Composition</HI> is the <HI>Juice of Oranges</HI> and <HI>Lemons.</HI> And if we consider, that a <HI>Lemon</HI> or <HI>Orange</HI> could never be transported <HI>half Seas</HI> over to us, without rotting or spoiling, if gather∣ed when wholly <HI>ripe,</HI> we should have no great Opinion of their <HI>Juices.</HI> Eve∣ry <HI>Spanish</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchant can in∣form

us, that they must be gathered <HI>green,</HI> or at least a <HI>Month</HI> before they are <HI>ripe,</HI> else they are not fit to be sent beyond the <HI>Seas.</HI> The <HI>Sea-Air,</HI> and their being shut up <HI>close,</HI> gives them that <HI>gol∣den yellow Colour,</HI> we so much admire. The <HI>Juice</HI> of a <HI>Crab Apple,</HI> of <HI>unripe Grapes,</HI> or <HI>Goose-berries,</HI> or even <HI>good Juice</HI> of <HI>Sorrel,</HI> would come up at least to their Virtue of extinguishing the Heat of <HI>Spirits,</HI> if not to their <HI>Flavour.</HI> And how kindly a <HI>Guest</HI> such <HI>Juices</HI> would be to the <HI>fine Fibres</HI> of weak <HI>Stomachs</HI> and <HI>Bowels,</HI> I leave every one to judge. The Truth is, all <HI>fermenting</HI> Juices, such as these <HI>eminently</HI> are, must be highly injurious to <HI>weak Constitutions</HI>; for meet∣ing with the <HI>Crudities</HI> in the <HI>Bowels,</HI> they must raise a new <HI>Battle</HI> and <HI>Col∣luctation</HI> there, and so must blow up the whole <HI>Cavities</HI> of the <HI>human</HI> Body, with acrid <HI>Fumes</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> the great and sore Enemy of such Bowels. And in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> where from the Necessity of drinking much, because of the Vio∣lence of the <HI>Heat,</HI> and from the Want of proper <HI>Liquors</HI> there, they are forced to drink much <HI>PUNCH,</HI> tho' <HI>Lemons</HI> and <HI>Oranges</HI> be in their full Perfection, they are universally afflicted with <HI>Ner∣vous</HI> and <HI>Mortal dry-Belly-aches, Palsies,</HI>

<P>The <HI>Bath-Water,</HI> is the only <HI>Remedy</HI> in such Cases, whither they all hasten, if they can get thither <HI>alive.</HI> And here I have been inform'd of this <HI>Fact,</HI> by Men of the <HI>Profession,</HI> as well as their <HI>Patients,</HI> who universally ascrib'd them to their drinking of <HI>PUNCH</HI> and <HI>Spiri∣tuous Liquors.</HI> If <HI>Acids</HI> must be had, without all peradventure, the <HI>Vinous</HI> ones, are the best and safest. The <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> tho' they had the vegetable <HI>Acids</HI> in perfection, made very little Use of them but in <HI>Cookery,</HI> where the <HI>Quan∣tity</HI> of the <HI>Poison</HI> was so small, as not to do sufficient Harm, to forbid their using them for the Sake of the exquisite Relish they gave their <HI>Sauces</HI>; and the constant Drink of the lower <HI>Souldiery,</HI> was <HI>Vinegar</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> which they found of excellent Use, both as it prevented <HI>Fevers, Plagues</HI> and <HI>Putre∣faction,</HI> and also as it gave an <HI>Energy</HI> to the unactive <HI>Element,</HI> and hindered it from <HI>lodging</HI> in the Body. Hence also the great Use of <HI>Oxymel</HI> and <HI>Oxy∣crate,</HI> (that is, of <HI>Vinegar</HI> with <HI>Honey</HI> and with <HI>Water</HI>) among all the antient <HI>Physicians.</HI> And indeed, whenever

they prescrib'd an <HI>Acid,</HI> they very pru∣dently join'd a Corrective with it, both to promote its <HI>good,</HI> and to prevent it's <HI>bad</HI> Effects. The two remaining <HI>In∣gredients,</HI> are <HI>Sugar</HI> and <HI>Water</HI>; and these I will give up to the <HI>Punch∣Drinkers,</HI> and allow them all the Be∣nefit of them, they can bring to this <HI>Composition:</HI> Yet it will still have <HI>Ma∣lignity</HI> sufficient remaining, to be held in Detestation, (at least for any great <HI>Use,</HI> or in any great <HI>Quantity,</HI> for some <HI>Poisons</HI> are so only by their <HI>Quantity</HI>) by those <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>valetudinary</HI> Persons, who value <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Life.</HI> The <HI>Strong,</HI> the <HI>Voluptuous,</HI> and the <HI>Aban∣doned,</HI> need no <HI>Advice,</HI> at least they will take none.

<PB N="63" REF="111"/>
after a full Meal, or when one is adry between Meals, and much more safe and effectual than <HI>Drams</HI> or strong <HI>Cor∣dials,</HI> which are commonly used for that Purpose. Some Persons of weak tender <HI>Nerves,</HI> fall into <HI>Lowness</HI> and <HI>Trem∣bling</HI> upon using either of these Liquors with any Freedom, from their too great <HI>Quantity,</HI> or their <HI>Irritation</HI> on the ten∣der, and delicate <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Stomach. Such ought carefully to avoid and ab∣stain from them, as from <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Drops.</HI> But I can never be of their O∣pinion who ascribe the Frequency of <HI>Scurvy, Vapours, Lowspiritedness,</HI> and <HI>nervous</HI> Distempers now, to what they were in the Days of our <HI>Forefathers,</HI> to the Custom of Drinking more frequent∣ly and freely of these <HI>foreign Infusions.</HI> The Cause is not <HI>adequate</HI> to the Effect; nor indeed has any <HI>Analogy</HI> to, or <HI>Con∣nexion</HI> with it. We know that warm Water, will most of any Thing promote and assist <HI>Digestion</HI> in weak Stomachs and tender <HI>Nerves.</HI> And by this alone I have seen several such Persons recover to a Miracle, when <HI>cold Mineral</HI> Waters, <HI>Bitters, Cordials</HI> and <HI>Drams,</HI> have done rather Hurt than Good. And <HI>Tea</HI> is but an <HI>Infusion</HI> in Water of an <HI>innocent</HI> Plant: <HI>Innocent,</HI> I say, because we find
<PB N="64" REF="112"/>
by its Taste it has neither <HI>poisonous, de∣leterious</HI> nor <HI>acrimonious</HI> Qualities; and we are certain from it's Use in the Countries it comes from, (which are larg∣er than most of <HI>Europe</HI>) that they receive no Damage from it, but on the contra∣ry, that it promotes both <HI>Digestion</HI> and <HI>Perspiration.</HI> The Argument from its <HI>relaxing</HI> the Coats of the Stomach and Bowels by its <HI>Heat,</HI> is of no force. For unless it be drunk much hotter than the Blood itself, it can do no hurt that way: And we see the <HI>Bath</HI> Guides, who dabble in Water almost as <HI>hot</HI> as <HI>Tea</HI> is ever drunk, a great Part of the Day, and for one half of the Year at least, are no ways injured by it; except when they drink <HI>strong Liquors,</HI> too freely to quench the Thirst it raises. However, I should advise those who drink <HI>Tea</HI> plentifully, not to drink it much <HI>hotter</HI> than <HI>blood∣warm</HI>; whereby they will receive all its <HI>Benefit,</HI> and be secure against all the Harm it can possibly do. As to <HI>Choco∣late,</HI> I am of opinion, it is too hot and heavy, for <HI>valetudinary</HI> Persons; and those of weak <HI>Nerves.</HI> I have before observed, that <HI>Nuts</HI> pass through the <HI>alimentary</HI> Passages untouched; and tho' they may part with some of their more <HI>vo∣latile</HI> Particles, yet, I doubt if they can afford
<PB N="65" REF="113"/>
much nourishment to Persons of <HI>weak Digestions.</HI> Some say, <HI>Chocolate</HI> gives them an Appetite; the meaning of which may be, that when they have a good Ap∣petite for their <HI>Breakfast</HI>; it is not unlike∣ly it may continue all the Day: But I am of opinion, 'tis a <HI>false</HI> and <HI>hysterical Appetite,</HI> such as sharp Wines, and sharp Humours in the Stomach give. For <HI>fat</HI> and <HI>oily</HI> Things, such as all Nuts are, are hard to digest, and lie long in the Sto∣mach, for reasons I have already ex∣plain'd: It may lubricate and sheath against the <HI>Irritation</HI> of <HI>salt</HI> and <HI>sharp Humours</HI> in the Bowels, and therefore may be good in the <HI>Colicks</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> of those of strong and stout Digestion; but can ne∣ver be good Food for those of <HI>weak Nerves</HI> and <HI>poor Constitutions.</HI> Nothing is so light and easy to the Stomach, most certainly, as the <HI>Farinaceous</HI> or mealy <HI>Vegetables</HI>; such as <HI>Pease, Beans, Mil∣let, Oats, Barly, Rye, Wheat, Sago, Rice, Potatoes,</HI> and the like; of some of which on <HI>Milk</HI> or <HI>Water,</HI> I should ever advise the <HI>Valetudinary,</HI> and those of <HI>weak Nerves,</HI> to make their two <HI>lesser</HI> or <HI>secondary</HI> Meals. <HI>Tobacco</HI> is another <HI>foreign Weed,</HI> much in use here in <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>; though not among the <HI>best,</HI> yet among the <HI>middle</HI> and inferiour Ranks of the People: For those of gross and

<HI>Phlegmatick</HI> Constitutions, who abound in <HI>serous</HI> and watry Humours, who are subject to <HI>Coughs, Catarrhs,</HI> and <HI>asthma∣tick</HI> Indispositions; who labour under vio∣lent <HI>Tooth-achs,</HI> or are troubled with <HI>Rheums</HI> in their <HI>Eyes</HI>; who have cold and <HI>waterish</HI> Stomachs, and live fully and freely, both <HI>Smoaking</HI> and <HI>Chewing</HI> is a very beneficial Evacuation, drawing off <HI>superfluous</HI> Humours, <HI>Crudities,</HI> and cold <HI>Phlegm,</HI> provided they carefully avoid swallowing the <HI>Smoak,</HI> or the <HI>Juice</HI>; and drink nothing, but rinse their Mouths with some watry Liquor after it, and spit it out. But to <HI>thin, meagre,</HI> and <HI>hectick</HI> Constitutions, it is highly pernicious, and destructive; heating their Blood, dry∣ing their Solids, and defrauding the Food of that <HI>Saliva,</HI> which is so absolutely necessary towards <HI>Concoction. Snuffing</HI> the Leaves, or the grosser <HI>Cut</HI> in a Morning, will readily promote a <HI>Flux</HI> of <HI>Rheum</HI> by the Glands of the Nose; and will be of good use, to clear the <HI>Head</HI> and the <HI>Eyes.</HI> But the ridiculous Custom, of perpetually sucking in <HI>so∣phisticated</HI> Powders, and other Foreign <HI>Drugs</HI> sold for <HI>Snuff,</HI> cannot but be prejudicial both to the <HI>Eyes,</HI> and even to the <HI>Stomach</HI>; at least, if we believe the Reports of those who say they have brought it up from thence.</P>

<P>I have endeavour'd to assist the <HI>Reader,</HI> with some <HI>Observations</HI> and <HI>Reflexions,</HI> to enable him towards de∣termining the <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> of his <HI>solid Food,</HI> necessary either to prevent or cure <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers. It may not be amiss, here to make some Refle∣xions also on the fit Proportion of <HI>Drink</HI> proper for that purpose: As the <HI>Food</HI> is, so must <HI>that</HI> be, various and uncertain, with regard to the <HI>Age, Size, Labour,</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> of the Person, and the <HI>Season</HI> of the Year. I have of∣fer'd to limit the <HI>Quantity</HI> of strong Li∣quors, fittest to preserve Health and length∣en out Life in general, to a <HI>Pound</HI> or <HI>Pint,</HI> and that of the <HI>middling</HI> Kind. But the <HI>Sickly,</HI> the <HI>Aged,</HI> and those who would cure a <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, must even abate of <HI>this</HI> Quantity. The only remaining Question, is about the Quantity of <HI>Water,</HI> or watry Liquors, proper to be mix'd with this <HI>strong</HI> Li∣quor, or drunk by itself: For in this also, though in itself harmless and innocent, yet there is a <HI>Choice</HI> and Preference; because, too much Water will only serve to <HI>distend</HI> and <HI>swell</HI> up the Vessels, and wash off some of the finer and more nutritious parts of the <HI>Chyle</HI>; and too little, will not be sufficient to dilute the <HI>solid Food,</HI> or to make the Chyle <HI>thin</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="116"/>
and <HI>fluid</HI> enough, to circulate through the <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>small</HI> Vessels. I will suppose my <HI>Patient</HI> to deal in no other <HI>Cookery,</HI> but <HI>Roasting</HI> and <HI>Boiling</HI>; and that he eats only <HI>fresh</HI> Meat. <HI>Boiling animal</HI> Food, draws more of the <HI>rank, strong,</HI> Juices from it, and leaves it less <HI>nutri∣tive,</HI> more <HI>diluted, lighter</HI> and <HI>easier</HI> of Digestion. <HI>Roasting</HI> on the other hand, leaves it fuller of the <HI>strong</HI> nutri∣tive Juices, <HI>harder</HI> to digest, and wanting more <HI>Dilution:</HI> Those therefore, who must have full grown and <HI>adult animal</HI> Food, ought to eat it boiled, and <HI>well</HI> boiled too; if their Digestion be but weak. They who can live on <HI>young</HI> animal Food, (which is best for weak Stomachs,) ought to eat it <HI>roasted,</HI> but must lessen the Quantity, in respect of the same Food <HI>boiled</HI>; but they must di∣lute it more: For as <HI>roast</HI> Meat has a better Flavour, and more Nourishment, so it lies less <HI>flabby</HI> on the Stomach, and does not so readily <HI>slip</HI> from, or disap∣point the <HI>Action</HI> of <HI>Grinding,</HI> which has some share in <HI>Digestions,</HI> both <HI>pri∣mary</HI> and <HI>subsequent:</HI> But it will want more <HI>Dilution,</HI> with a watry <HI>Men∣struum,</HI> to soften its more <HI>rigid</HI> and <HI>crisp</HI> Fibres. If therefore, the whole Weight of the solid Food, in twenty four Hours, be supposed a <HI>Pound</HI> and a <HI>Half,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="117"/>
then <HI>three Pounds</HI> of Liquor, that is, one of strong Liquor, and two of some aqueous Fluid, will in a Medium, be sufficient to dilute it abundantly. For thus there will be two Particles of a Fluid, to one solid Particle; which abating the solid Parts thrown off by <HI>Siege,</HI> will suf∣fice to make the <HI>Chyle</HI> abundantly thin, to circulate through all the <HI>fine</HI> Channels, whose <HI>Diameters</HI> are <HI>larger</HI> than <HI>that</HI> of the solid Particle, the principal End of its <HI>Thinness</HI> and <HI>Fluidity.</HI> More than this, would but <HI>distend</HI> the Vessels, and carry off the <HI>finer</HI> Parts of the <HI>Chyle</HI> by <HI>Water</HI> or <HI>Perspiration</HI>; for we constant∣ly find <HI>both these</HI> encreased by an <HI>over∣dose</HI> of Fluids: And less would not suf∣ficiently dilute their Food. I should ad∣vise those therefore, who have <HI>weak</HI> Sto∣machs, or <HI>relaxed Nerves,</HI> to mix their Wine with the above-named quantity of boiled Water, with a burnt Crust, at least <HI>Blood-warm,</HI> and to drink it after their Meal is over, if they can do it with ease, rather than in the Time of Eating: For the more <HI>spirituous</HI> and most nourishing Parts of the Food, will readily run off, without much <HI>Dilution</HI>; and it will be the <HI>grosser</HI> and <HI>harder</HI> remaining Part, that will want it most. And if some time after their great Meal, they find their Stomach <HI>load∣ed,</HI> the Food rising, <HI>hard Belching,</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="118"/>
<HI>Heart-burning,</HI> or much <HI>Yawning,</HI> to swill down and dilute it with milk-warm, light <HI>Green Tea,</HI> or warm Water, rather than to run to <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Cordials,</HI> the usual, but most pernicious <HI>Antidote</HI> in such Cases. And upon great and heavy <HI>Op∣pression,</HI> much trouble and great struggle in the Digestion, to have recourse to <HI>Carduus</HI> or <HI>Camomile-Flower Tea,</HI> to bring it up, rather than to trespass in these <HI>poisonous</HI> and <HI>caustick</HI> Liquors; which, though they may at present les∣sen the suffering, and hurry on the <HI>first∣Concoction</HI>; yet make them dearly pay for it, when the <HI>unconcocted</HI> load of <HI>Crudities</HI> comes to pass by <HI>Siege</HI> or <HI>Per∣spiration,</HI> either in <HI>Colicks, Gripes, Va∣pours,</HI> and <HI>Oppression</HI> of Spirits; or by a general <HI>Disability</HI> and <HI>Rheumatick</HI> Stitches and Pains.</P>

<HEAD>General Rules for Health and Long Life, drawn from the Head of MEAT and DRINK.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE great <HI>Rule</HI> of Eating and Drinking for <HI>Health,</HI> is to adjust the <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Quantity</HI> of our Food to our <HI>digestive</HI> Powers. The <HI>Quality</HI> may be judged by the following <HI>Rules.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Those <HI>Substances</HI> that consist of the <HI>grossest</HI> Parts are hardest of <HI>Digestion</HI>; the constituent <HI>Particles</HI> coming into more <HI>Contacts,</HI> and consequently adher∣ing more firmly.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. These <HI>Substances</HI> whose Parts are brought together with the greatest <HI>Force,</HI> cohere proportionably closer, than those that come together with a smaller <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> Force.</NOTE><HI>Mo∣mentum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Salts</HI> are very hard to be separated, because united by plain <HI>Surfaces,</HI> under which they are always comprehended. And in the last Stages of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> where it is slower, <HI>shoot</HI> readily into lar∣ger <HI>Clusters,</HI> and so are harder to be dri∣ven out of the <HI>Habit.</HI> From these we may easily infer, that (1.) Those <HI>Vegeta∣bles</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> that come soonest to their full <HI>Growth</HI> are easier of Digestion, than those that are longer of attaining
<PB N="73" REF="121"/>
the State of <HI>Maturity.</HI> (2.) Those that are the <HI>smallest</HI> of their Kind, than the <HI>biggest.</HI> (3.) Those of a <HI>dry, fleshy</HI> and <HI>fibrous Substance,</HI> than the <HI>oily, fat,</HI> and <HI>glutinous.</HI> (4.) Those of a <HI>white</HI> Sub∣stance, than those of a more <HI>flaming</HI> Co∣lour. (5.) Those of a <HI>mild, soft,</HI> and <HI>sweet,</HI> than those of a <HI>strong, poignant, aromatical,</HI> or <HI>hot</HI> Taste. (6.) <HI>Land-A∣nimals,</HI> than <HI>Sea-Animals.</HI> (7.) Those <HI>Animals</HI> that live on <HI>Vegetables,</HI> or other <HI>light</HI> Food, than those that live on other <HI>Animals,</HI> or hard and <HI>heavy</HI> Food. (8.) The Nourishment Nature has appointed for young <HI>Animals,</HI> is lighter than the Flesh of these <HI>Animals</HI> themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. All <HI>cramm'd</HI> Poultry and <HI>stall-fed</HI> Cattle, and even <HI>Vegetables</HI> forced by hot Beds, tend more to <HI>Putrefaction,</HI> and consequently are more unfit for <HI>hu∣man</HI> Food, than those brought up in the natural Manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Plain-dressed</HI> Food is easier of Di∣gestion, than what is <HI>pickled, salted, baked, smoaked,</HI> or any Way <HI>high-seasoned.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Strong</HI> Men, those of <HI>large</HI> Stature, and much <HI>Labour,</HI> and the Inhabitants of a <HI>cold</HI> and clear Air, require <HI>more</HI> Food than <HI>Women, Children,</HI> the <HI>Weak,</HI> the <HI>Se∣dentary,</HI> and the <HI>Aged,</HI> and those that live in a <HI>warmer</HI> Climate, or <HI>grosser Air.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="74" REF="122"/>8. Nothing conduces more to <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life,</HI> than <HI>Abstinence</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> Food, with due <HI>Labour.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>9. Where <HI>Exercise</HI> is wanting (as in <HI>studious</HI> Persons) there is the greater Need of <HI>Abstinence</HI>; for these, 8 <HI>Ounces</HI> of <HI>animal,</HI> and 12 of <HI>vegetable</HI> Food, in 24 Hours, is sufficient.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. Most <HI>chronical</HI> Diseases proceed from <HI>Repletion</HI>; as appears from their being cured by <HI>Evacuation.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>11. <HI>Tender</HI> Persons ought to use as much <HI>Abstinence,</HI> as they possibly can: And, if they neglect it, their only Re∣lief is from frequent <HI>stomachick</HI> and <HI>Fa∣mily-Purges.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>12. A <HI>plain</HI> Rule for judging of the <HI>Quantity</HI> is, not to eat so much as in∣disposes for <HI>Business.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>13. A more <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>readier</HI> one is, first by <HI>Experience</HI> to find out how much fits one, so as to be <HI>lightsome</HI> and <HI>healthy</HI> under it, and ever after to judge the <HI>Quantity</HI> by the <HI>Eye</HI>; <HI>Nature</HI> requir∣ing therein no <HI>mathematical</HI> Exactness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>14. <HI>Pork</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI> are not fit Food for the <HI>Studious</HI> and the <HI>Tender.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>15. <HI>Water</HI> is the most natural and wholesome of all <HI>Drinks,</HI> quickens the Appetite, and strengthens the <HI>Digestion</HI> most.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="75" REF="123"/>16. <HI>Strong</HI> and <HI>spirituous</HI> Liquors free∣ly indulged, become a certain tho' a slow <HI>Poison.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>17. There is no Danger in leaving them off all at <HI>once</HI>; the <HI>Plea</HI> for con∣tinuing them being false and groundless.</ITEM>
<ITEM>18. The best <HI>strong Liquor</HI> for <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>studious</HI> People is <HI>Wine</HI>; the best <HI>Quantity,</HI> a <HI>Pint</HI> in 24 Hours; and the best Way of drinking it is, three Glasses <HI>with,</HI> and three <HI>without Water.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>19. The <HI>middling, light</HI> Wines, <HI>fully ripe,</HI> and of a <HI>due Age,</HI> are preferable to the <HI>strong Wines.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>20. Strong Liquors do not prevent the Mischiefs of a <HI>Surfeit,</HI> nor carry it off, so safely as <HI>Water,</HI> tho' they seem to give present <HI>Relief.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>21. The frequent <HI>Use</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> in <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Cordials,</HI> is so far from cu∣ring <HI>Low-spiritedness,</HI> that it increases it, and brings on more <HI>fatal</HI> Disorders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>22. And even when they are diluted with Water, in PUNCH, the Quantity taken down at once, and the Addition of a corroding <HI>Acid,</HI> produce equally <HI>pernicious</HI> Effects in human Constitutions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>23. <HI>Malt Liquors</HI> (excepting clear small Beer, of a due Age) are extremely hurt∣ful to <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>studious</HI> Persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="76" REF="124"/>24. <HI>Coffee</HI> is only an <HI>Infusion</HI> of a kind of <HI>Calx,</HI> and has the Effects of an <HI>absorbent</HI> Medicine; and so may be of some Service to <HI>watry Stomachs,</HI> if <HI>mo∣derately</HI> used.</ITEM>
<ITEM>25. <HI>Green Tea</HI> is a good <HI>Diluter</HI> of the Food, as it is an agreeable, <HI>warm, small</HI> Liquor: But <HI>Bohea</HI> is too <HI>heavy</HI> for the <HI>Stomach.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>26. <HI>Chocolate</HI> (as all Nuts else) is so <HI>heavy</HI> and <HI>hard</HI> of <HI>Digestion,</HI> that it can <HI>never be fit</HI> for the Stomachs of <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>27. <HI>Smoaking Tobacco,</HI> without <HI>drink∣ing</HI> after it, <HI>Chewing</HI> or <HI>Snuffing</HI> the gross cut <HI>Leaf</HI> in a Morning, are useful to <HI>fleg∣matick</HI> Constitutions; but to <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>lean</HI> Habits they are <HI>pernicious. Snuff</HI> is just <HI>good for nothing</HI> at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>28. The proper <HI>Quantity</HI> of <HI>watry Li∣quors</HI> in 24 Hours, to those that live re∣gularly, is <HI>two Pints,</HI> (as that of <HI>strong</HI> Liquor is <HI>one</HI> Pint) which is best drank <HI>warm,</HI> and rather <HI>after</HI> than in the Time of <HI>Eating.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>29. The Form of a <HI>Cordial</HI> fit to be kept in private Families, as a present and certian Relief, for sudden <HI>Qualms, Faint∣ness, Sickness,</HI> or <HI>low Spirits</HI>; but never to be taken but in Case of Necessity.</ITEM>

our <HI>Sleep</HI> is <HI>sound, sweet</HI> and <HI>refreshing,</HI> according as the alimentary <HI>Organs,</HI> are easy, quiet and clean. If any one not suffering under any disease, is disturbed in his Sleep, 'tis certain his Stomach is filled with <HI>Food,</HI> or <HI>Crudities</HI>; or his <HI>Guts</HI> filled with <HI>Wind, Choler,</HI> or <HI>super∣fluous Chyle:</HI> And those restless Nights, and the difficulty of going to Sleep, which are generally ascribed to <HI>Vapours,</HI> are entirely owing to these Causes; though they be not so <HI>strong,</HI> as to become sen∣sible; for then <HI>Pain</HI> is added to <HI>Watch∣ing</HI> and they are felt. And upon com∣plaints of such restless Nights, I never once failed, upon enquiry of finding the true Cause in the <HI>Diet,</HI> of the preceding Day, or of some few Days before; and constantly have discovered that some er∣ror in <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking,</HI> either in <HI>Quantity</HI> or <HI>Quality</HI> has produced them.

Yawnings, Coughing, Spitting, or Reach∣ing and Heaving, without <HI>Appetite, Spi∣rits</HI> or <HI>Life,</HI> all the Day-time; begin to live and breath, become <HI>cheerful</HI> and hun∣gry, about ten, eleven, or twelve a clock at Night; eat a <HI>hearty, various,</HI> and <HI>luxurious</HI> Supper; drink a <HI>cheeruping</HI> Cup of the best, become as merry as <HI>Crickets,</HI> and long to sit up later; at last, tumble to Bed, and repeat the same <HI>Farce</HI> over again. The Reason of all this Com∣plaint, is the Load on the Stomach, that will not suffer them to rest, till 'tis got off. The sharp and crude Humours, <HI>twitching</HI> and <HI>twinging</HI> the <HI>nervous Fi∣bres,</HI> and Coats of the <HI>Bowels,</HI> become like so many <HI>Needles</HI> and <HI>Pins,</HI> constant∣ly running through them; though not always with sensible pain: The <HI>uncon∣cocted</HI> Chyle stopping or circulating <HI>slow∣ly, first</HI> in the Bowels, <HI>then</HI> in the smal∣lest <HI>Vessels,</HI> begets these <HI>Convulsions, Fla∣tus, Night-Mares,</HI> and <HI>Oppressions</HI> of <HI>Spirits.</HI> So that the secondary Digesti∣ons are not over till next Evening, (hence their want of <HI>Appetite:</HI>) And when these are finished their <HI>Stomachs</HI> come, and their <HI>Spirits</HI> flow; and thus the perpe∣tual <HI>Round</HI> is carried on.

<P>The Seasons for <HI>Sleeping</HI> and <HI>Watching,</HI> which Nature seems to point out to us, at least in these our <HI>Climates</HI> near the <HI>Tropick,</HI> are the <HI>Vicissitudes</HI> of <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night.</HI> Those <HI>Damps, Vapours,</HI> and <HI>Exhalations,</HI> that are drawn up into the <HI>higher Regions,</HI> and are so rarified by the Heat and Action of the <HI>Sun,</HI> as to become <HI>innocent</HI> or very weak in the Day-time; are <HI>condensed, sink</HI> low, near the <HI>Surface</HI> of the Earth, and are perpe∣tually dropping down in the Night Sea∣son; and consequently must be <HI>injuri∣ous</HI> to those <HI>tender</HI> Persons, that <HI>unna∣turally</HI> watch in that Season; and must necessarily obstruct the <HI>Perspiration,</HI> which the <HI>Activity of Watching,</HI> and the <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Labour</HI> promotes. I have already shewn, that our Bodies <HI>suck</HI> and

<HI>draw</HI> into them, the good or bad qua∣lities of the <HI>circumambient Air,</HI> through the Mouths of all the <HI>perspiratory Ducts</HI> of the Skin. And if we were to view an <HI>animal</HI> Body with a proper Glass, it would appear with an <HI>Atmosphere</HI> quite round it, like the <HI>Steam</HI> of a boiling Pot. Now we may easily conceive, what injury a <HI>Constitution</HI> may receive, not only by stopping such a perpetual <HI>Dis∣charge</HI> of <HI>Superfluities,</HI> but also by force∣ing into the <HI>Habit,</HI> by the <HI>Air</HI>'s <HI>Weight</HI> and <HI>Pressure,</HI> those <HI>noxious Fumes</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> that are perpetually falling near the <HI>Surface</HI> of the Earth, in the Night∣time. Your true <HI>Topers</HI> are so sensible of this, that by Observation they have gathered it to be more safe for their <HI>Health,</HI> and better for prolonging their <HI>Lives,</HI> to get <HI>drunk</HI> betimes and go to Bed, than to sit up and be <HI>sober.</HI></P>

<P>Nothing can be more prejudicial to <HI>tender</HI> Constitutions, <HI>studious</HI> and <HI>con∣templative</HI> Persons, than lying long a Bed, or <HI>lolling</HI> and <HI>soaking</HI> in <HI>Sheets,</HI> any time after one is distinctly awake, or has slept a due and reasonable Time: It necessarily <HI>thickens</HI> the Juices, <HI>enervates</HI> the Solids, and <HI>weakens</HI> the Constitution. A free open <HI>Air</HI> is a kind of a <HI>cold Bath,</HI> especially after rising out of a warm Bed; and con∣sequently makes the <HI>Circulation</HI> brisker and more compleat, and <HI>braces</HI> up the Solids, which lying a Bed <HI>dissolves</HI> and

<HEAD>Rules for Health and Long Life, drawn from the Head of SLEEP and WATCHING.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE <HI>Valetudinary,</HI> the <HI>Sedentary,</HI> and the <HI>Studious</HI> should eat very light, or no <HI>Supper</HI>; if any, it ought to be <HI>vegetable</HI> Food; neither ought they to go soon to <HI>Bed,</HI> after any <HI>Supper</HI> whatsoever.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Going to <HI>Bed</HI> on a <HI>full Stomach,</HI> and <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Crudities</HI> somewhere in the in the <HI>alimentary</HI> Passages, is the Cause of the want of due <HI>Rest,</HI> which is <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>refreshing,</HI> always in <HI>Proportion</HI> to the <HI>Emptiness</HI> and <HI>Cleanness</HI> of these <HI>Pas∣sages,</HI> and their <HI>Vacation</HI> from their pro∣per Office of <HI>Digestion:</HI> And this is the Cause of the Want of <HI>kindly and refresh∣ing Rest,</HI> in <HI>hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>hysteri∣cal</HI> People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Watching</HI> by Night and <HI>Sleeping</HI> by Day, is of the most pernicious Conse∣quence to <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life</HI>; and plainly contrary to the Indications of <HI>Na∣ture</HI> and the <HI>Constitutions</HI> of our Bodies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Valetudinary, Sedentary,</HI> and <HI>Studious,</HI> ought carefully to avoid even∣ing <HI>Dews,</HI> nocturnal <HI>Studies,</HI> and unsea∣sonable <HI>Watching</HI>; go to Bed by <HI>eight,</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="136"/>
<HI>nine,</HI> or <HI>ten,</HI> and rise proportionably by <HI>four, five,</HI> or <HI>six</HI>; unless actually under a <HI>Fit</HI> of Sickness.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Nothing is more prejudicial to <HI>ten∣der</HI> Constitutions, than lying <HI>long</HI> a Bed, indulging a <HI>lethargical</HI> and drowsy Sleep, or <HI>lolling</HI> or <HI>loitering</HI> awake; as appears by their <HI>Heaviness,</HI> and want of <HI>Appe∣tite,</HI> upon doing so; and their good <HI>Sto∣machs, Cheerfullness,</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Spirits,</HI> when they rise <HI>early.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The most advantagious manner for the <HI>Tender, Sedentary,</HI> and <HI>Studious,</HI> to bestow their Time, on account both of their <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Studies,</HI> is to go <HI>early</HI> to Bed, rise <HI>betimes,</HI> go about their Studies till <HI>eleven,</HI> taking a light <HI>vegetable</HI> Break∣fast; prosecute them till about <HI>four</HI> in the Afternoon, then to take their great Meal of <HI>animal</HI> Food, and after that to employ the rest of their Time in some <HI>innocent Amusement,</HI> or gentle bodily <HI>Exercise</HI>; to retire betimes, to prepare for going to Bed, taking no farther Nourishment, ex∣cept a Draught of Water or warm <HI>Sack∣Whey,</HI> which will be particularly useful to those who labour under <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel.</HI></ITEM>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§. 1.</HEAD>
<P>WE proceed; in the next Place, to the Consideration of <HI>Exer∣cise</HI> and <HI>Quiet,</HI> the due <HI>Regulation</HI> of which, is almost as necessary to <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life,</HI> as <HI>Food</HI> itself. Whether we were so made before the <HI>Fall,</HI> as to live in <HI>intire</HI> Health, in a rigidly <HI>seden∣tary</HI> and <HI>contemplative</HI> Life, is a <HI>Specula∣tion</HI> of no great <HI>Consequence,</HI> nor easily determined in our present <HI>Situation</HI>; for there is no certain <HI>Analogy</HI> between Things as they now are, and as they might have been then. As there happen'd an intire <HI>Revolution</HI> in the <HI>Complexion</HI> and <HI>Qualities</HI> of the <HI>Minds</HI> of the <HI>First Pair</HI>; so, to me, there appear, to be evident <HI>Indications</HI> of a designed Change and <HI>Alteration</HI> of the <HI>material World,</HI> and the Nature of the <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> which subsist on this <HI>Globe,</HI> from what they were when GOD pronounced
<PB N="90" REF="138"/>
every Thing <HI>Good</HI> that he had made. Nor seem the <HI>Coelestial</HI> Bodies to have escaped, so far as they regard us. Whatever be in this, the Passage where God tells <HI>Adam,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> chap. iii. <HI>v.</HI> 19.</NOTE><HI>That in the Sweat of his Brow he shall eat Bread,</HI> seems to be the Injunction of a <HI>salutary</HI> Penance; that is, Not merely a <HI>Punishment,</HI> but also a <HI>Remedy</HI> against the Disorders his Body would be liable to in this <HI>new</HI> State of the Creation, and against the poisonous Ef∣fects of the <HI>Forbidden Tree</HI> he had eaten the Fruit of. I am the more confirmed in this Belief, that I observe, the <HI>absolute</HI> Necessity of <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> to pre∣serve the Body any Time in due plight, to maintain <HI>Health,</HI> and lengthen out <HI>Life.</HI> For let whatsoever <HI>Diet</HI> be pur∣sued, however adjusted both in <HI>Quan∣tity</HI> and <HI>Quality,</HI> let whatever <HI>Evacua∣tions</HI> be used to lessen the <HI>Malady,</HI> or any <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> Equivalent.</NOTE><HI>Succedaneum</HI> be proposed, to pre∣vent the ill Effects, our Bodies are so made, and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> now so contrived, that without due <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> the <HI>Juices</HI> will thicken, the
<PB N="91" REF="139"/>
<HI>Joints</HI> will stiffen, the <HI>Nerves</HI> will relax, and on these Disorders, <HI>Chronical Di∣stempers,</HI> and a crazy old <HI>Age</HI> must ensue. Nor is this necessary only in the <HI>colder</HI> Climates, and where the Food is <HI>gross,</HI> but even in the <HI>warmest</HI> Climates, and where the Food is <HI>lightest.</HI> For though the <HI>Warmth</HI> of the Air may keep the <HI>Perspiration</HI> free and open, or rather, where it is very great, promote <HI>Sweat∣ing</HI>; yet, at the same time, and by Con∣sequence, it will <HI>thicken</HI> the Fluids, and <HI>relax</HI> the Fibres; to prevent both which, <HI>Exercise</HI> is absolutely necessary: but in such a Climate it ought to be gone about in the Cool of the Day. And tho' <HI>light Food</HI> may, <HI>in a great measure,</HI> prevent the <HI>Thickening</HI> of the Fluids, yet it cannot do it <HI>sufficiently</HI> without Exercise; nor can it <HI>at all</HI> keep the Fibres in due <HI>Tension</HI>; for to that purpose Exercise is absolutely necessary. Nay, the <HI>joint</HI> Power of <HI>warm</HI> Air and <HI>light</HI> Food cannot supply the Place of Exercise in keeping the <HI>Joints pliant</HI> and <HI>moveable,</HI> and preserv∣ing them from growing <HI>resty</HI> and <HI>stiff.</HI></P>

<P>I have sometimes also, indulg'd a Conjecture, that <HI>Animal</HI> Food, and <HI>Made</HI> or <HI>Artificial</HI> Liquors, in the <HI>Original</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="140"/>
Frame of our Nature, and Design of our <HI>Creation,</HI> were not intended for <HI>Human Creatures.</HI> They seem to me, neither to have these strong and fit <HI>Organs</HI> for dige∣sting them (at least such as <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Beasts</HI> of <HI>Prey</HI> have, who live on <HI>Flesh</HI>); nor, naturally, to have those <HI>voracious</HI> and <HI>brutish.</HI> Appetites, that require <HI>Animal</HI> Food, and strong Liquors, to satisfy them; nor those <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>hard</HI> Hearts, or those <HI>diabolical</HI> Passions, which could easily suffer them to tear and destroy their <HI>Fellow</HI> Creatures; at least, not in the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>early</HI> Ages, before <HI>every Man had corrupted his Way,</HI> and God was forced to exterminate the whole Race, by an universal Deluge, and was also obliged (that the <HI>Globe</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> might not, from the long Lives of its Inhabitants, become a <HI>Hell,</HI> and a <HI>Habitation</HI> for in∣carnate <HI>Devils</HI>) to shorten their Lives from 900 or 1000 Years, to 70.

<P>Therefore, to the <HI>Asthmatick,</HI> and those of weak <HI>Lungs,</HI> I should re∣commend <HI>Talking much</HI> and <HI>loud,</HI> even by themselves, walking up an easy <HI>Ascent,</HI> and when any degree of <HI>Weariness</HI> warns them, to sit and rest, till they are easy, and then to return to their <HI>walking</HI> again, and so to increase it every Day, till they are able to walk a <HI>reasonable</HI> Distance, in a <HI>reasonable</HI> Time.

<P>There are Three Conditions of <HI>Exercise</HI> to make it the most Beneficial that may be. <HI>First,</HI> That it be upon an <HI>empty</HI> Stomach (as, indeed, that is the proper Time for all <HI>Medicinal</HI> Evacuations) for thereby, the now <HI>concocted</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cocta non cruda sunt evacuanda,</HI> Hippocrat.</NOTE><HI>Crudities,</HI> or those <HI>Super∣stuities</HI> Nature would be rid of, and has fitted, by going through the proper <HI>Secretions,</HI> for being <HI>ejected,</HI> but cannot throw off without foreign <HI>Assistance,</HI> will be readiest discharged.

<P>Under this Head of <HI>Exercise,</HI> I cannot forbear recommending <HI>Cold∣bathing</HI>; and I cannot sufficiently admire, how it should ever have come into such <HI>Disuse,</HI> especially among <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> when commanded by the great∣est <HI>Lawgiver</HI> that ever was, under the Direction of <HI>God's Holy Spirit,</HI>

to his <HI>Chosen</HI> People, and <HI>perpetu∣ated</HI> to us in the <HI>Immersion</HI> at <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> by the same <HI>Spirit,</HI> who, with <HI>infinite</HI> Wisdom in this, as in every Thing else that regards the <HI>Temporal</HI> and <HI>Eternal</HI> Felicity of his <HI>Creatures,</HI> combines their <HI>Duty</HI> with their <HI>eternal</HI> Happiness. <HI>First,</HI> The Necessity of a free <HI>Perspiration</HI> to the <HI>Preservation</HI> of <HI>Health</HI> is now known to every Body, and frequent <HI>washing</HI> the Body in <HI>Water,</HI> cleanses the Mouths of the <HI>Perspiratory Ducts</HI> from that <HI>Glutinous</HI> Foulness that is continually falling upon them, from their own condensed <HI>dewy Atmosphere,</HI> whereby the <HI>Perspi∣ration</HI> would be soon <HI>obstructed,</HI> and the <HI>Party</HI> languish. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The hav∣ing the <HI>Circulation, full, free</HI> and <HI>open,</HI> thro' all the <HI>Capillary Arteries,</HI> is of great Benefit towards <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life.</HI> Now nothing promotes that so much as Cold-bathing; for by the violent and sudden Shock it gives to the whole <HI>System</HI> of the <HI>Fluids,</HI> from the <HI>Circumference</HI> in∣ward towards the <HI>Centre,</HI> and the <HI>Fluids</HI> (because <HI>Reaction</HI> is always <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>con∣trary</HI> to <HI>Action</HI>) springing back again from the <HI>Centre</HI> to the <HI>Circumference,</HI> a <HI>Force</HI> is raised almost ever sufficient to break thro' all the <HI>Dams</HI> and <HI>Obstructions</HI> of the

<HI>smallest</HI> Vessels, where they mostly hap∣pen, and to carry the <HI>Circulation</HI> quite round. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Nothing is so injurious, and so much prevents the Benefit of <HI>Exercise</HI> to <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>tender</HI> Constitu∣tions, as <HI>sucking</HI> into their Bodies the <HI>Nitrous</HI> and <HI>Humid Particles</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> that is, <HI>Catching of Cold.</HI> Now nothing so effectually <HI>prevents</HI> this, as <HI>Cold∣bathing</HI>; as the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Thing shews, and <HI>Experience</HI> confirms: For if <HI>Exercise,</HI> to attenuate the <HI>Juices</HI> and strengthen the <HI>Solids,</HI> be added to <HI>Cold∣bathing,</HI> a new <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> will be given to the <HI>Blood,</HI> both to drive out these <HI>foreign</HI> and noxious <HI>Mixtures,</HI> and to unite the <HI>Cuticular Scales,</HI> which form the <HI>Scarf-Skin,</HI> so as to strengthen it for the future against such violent <HI>Entries.</HI></P>

<P>I should advise therefore, every one who can afford it, as regularly to have a <HI>Cold Bath</HI> at their House to wash their Bodies in, as a <HI>Bason</HI> to wash their Hands; and, constantly, <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three</HI> Times a Week, <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Win∣ter,</HI> to go into it. And those that can∣not afford such <HI>Conveniency,</HI> as often as they can, to go into a <HI>River</HI> or <HI>Living Pond,</HI> to wash their Bodies. But this
<PB N="103" REF="151"/>
ought never to be done under the actual <HI>Fits</HI> of a <HI>Chronical</HI> Distemper, with a <HI>quick Pulse, Head-ach, weak Lungs,</HI> or a <HI>foul Stomach</HI>; nor ought they to stay in till they are <HI>over-chill'd.</HI> And in <HI>Winter,</HI> they ought to pursue their <HI>Exercises</HI> im∣mediately after they come out; and those of tender <HI>Nerves,</HI> ought to pour <HI>Basons</HI> of Cold Water on their Head, or wash it well with a <HI>dripping Spunge</HI> before they go in. I cannot approve the <HI>precipitant</HI> Way of <HI>jumping</HI> in, or throwing the Head foremost into a <HI>Cold Bath</HI>; it gives too violent a Shock to Nature, and risques too much the <HI>Bursting</HI> some of the smaller Vessels. The Natural Way is, holding by the <HI>Rope,</HI> to walk down the Steps as fast as one can, and when got to the <HI>Bottom,</HI> bending their <HI>Hams</HI> (as Women do when they Curt'sy low) to <HI>shorten</HI> their Length, so as to bring their Heads a good Way under <HI>Water,</HI> and then <HI>popping</HI> up again to take Breath; and thus alternately for two or three Times, and out again, <HI>rubbing</HI> and <HI>currying</HI> well before they are dress'd. And this brings me to say something of another kind of <HI>Exercise.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Flesh Brush</HI> is an <HI>Exercise</HI> most useful for promoting a full and free <HI>Perspiration</HI> and <HI>Circulation</HI>; Almost every Body knows, what well <HI>Currying</HI> will do to <HI>Horses,</HI> in making them <HI>sleek</HI> and <HI>gay, lively</HI> and <HI>active</HI>; even so much, as to be worth half the <HI>Feeding.</HI> This it can no otherwise <HI>effectuate,</HI> than by assisting <HI>Nature</HI> to throw off by <HI>Perspi∣ration,</HI> the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The grosser Parts.</NOTE><HI>Recrements</HI> of the Juices which stop the full and free <HI>Circu∣lation,</HI> and by constant <HI>Friction, Ir∣ritation</HI> and <HI>Stimulation,</HI> to <HI>allicite Blood</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> to the Parts most distant from the Seat of <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Mo∣tion,</HI> and so to <HI>plump</HI> up the <HI>superficial Muscles.</HI> The same Effect it would pro∣duce in other <HI>Animals,</HI> even <HI>Human</HI> Creatures themselves, if they were managed in the same Manner, with the same Care and Regularity.

<ITEM>1. WHATEVER was the <HI>Ori∣ginal</HI> Constitution of <HI>Man,</HI> in our present State, a due Degree of <HI>Ex∣ercise</HI> is indispensably necessary towards <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Long Life.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Animal</HI> Food and <HI>Strong Liquors,</HI> seem not to have been designed for <HI>Man</HI> in his Original <HI>Make</HI> and <HI>Frame</HI>; but rather indulged, to shorten the <HI>Anti∣diluvian Length</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> in order to pre∣vent the <HI>excessive</HI> Growth of <HI>Wickedness.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Walking</HI> is the most Natural and effectual <HI>Exercise,</HI> did it not spend the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the tender too much. <HI>Riding</HI> a Horseback is less laborious, and more effectual for such. Riding in a <HI>Coach</HI> is only for the <HI>Infirm,</HI> and <HI>Young</HI> Children. <HI>House</HI> Exercises are never
<PB N="107" REF="155"/>
to be allow'd, but when the <HI>Weather</HI> or some Bodily <HI>Infirmity</HI> will not permit going abroad; for <HI>Air</HI> contributes mightily to the Benefit of <HI>Exercise. Children</HI> naturally love all kinds of <HI>Ex∣ercise,</HI> which wonderfully promotes their <HI>Health,</HI> increases their Strength, and stretches out their <HI>Organs.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The <HI>Organs</HI> of the Body that are most used, always become <HI>strongest,</HI> and therefore we may strengthen any weak <HI>Organ</HI> by <HI>Exercise.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The <HI>Lungs</HI> are fortified by <HI>loud</HI> Talking, and <HI>walking</HI> up an easy <HI>Ascent.</HI> The <HI>Digestion</HI> and the <HI>Nerves</HI> are strengthened, and most <HI>Head-aches</HI> cured, by <HI>Riding</HI>; the <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel</HI> eased by riding in a <HI>Coach</HI> over rough Ground; <HI>Rheumatick</HI> Pains by playing at <HI>Tennis, Bil∣liards,</HI> &amp;c. till one <HI>sweat,</HI> and then going to a warm Bed, to promote the <HI>Sweating</HI>; Feeble <HI>Arms</HI> by playing at <HI>Shittlecock</HI> or <HI>Tennis</HI>; Weak <HI>Hams</HI> by <HI>Foot-ball,</HI> and weak <HI>Backs</HI> by <HI>Ringing</HI> or <HI>Pumping.</HI> The <HI>Gouty</HI> best recover the Use of their <HI>Limbs</HI> by Walking in <HI>rough</HI> Roads; but prevent the <HI>Fits</HI> best, by <HI>Riding</HI> a Horse∣back, or in a <HI>Coach.</HI> The <HI>Valetudinary,</HI>

and the <HI>Studious,</HI> ought to have stated Times for <HI>Exercise,</HI> at least Two or Three Hours a Day, the one Half <HI>be∣fore</HI> Dinner, the other <HI>before</HI> going to Bed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Exercise,</HI> 1. should always be gone about with an <HI>empty Stomach:</HI> 2. Should never be continued to <HI>Weariness:</HI> 3. Af∣ter it, one must take Care not to catch <HI>Cold.</HI> And it should always be accom∣panied with <HI>Temperance,</HI> else, instead of a <HI>Remedy,</HI> it will become an <HI>Evil.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Cold-bathing</HI> is of great Ad∣vantage to Health; but should not be used under a <HI>Fit</HI> of a <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, with a quick Pulse, or with a <HI>Head-ach,</HI> or by those that have weak <HI>Lungs.</HI> It promotes Perspiration, inlarges the <HI>Circulation,</HI> and prevents the Danger of catching <HI>Cold.</HI> Those of tender <HI>Nerves,</HI> should pour Water on their <HI>Heads</HI> before they go in, and none ought to jump in suddenly, and with their <HI>Heads</HI> foremost.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The <HI>Flesh-Brush</HI> is a most use∣ful <HI>Exercise,</HI> as appears by its Advan∣tage to <HI>Horses,</HI> and ought not only to

be used on Human Bodies, but also on such of the <HI>Animals</HI> we design for our Food, as it can be applied to.</ITEM>

Motion of their Guts are too weak, whereby the Food staying too long a Time before the Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> is over-drained of its <HI>Moisture.</HI> Those who have <HI>purging Stools,</HI> have eat <HI>too much,</HI> or of Things <HI>too strong</HI> for their <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers. For <HI>superfluous</HI> Nou∣rishment leaves too much <HI>Chyle</HI> in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> The Food, after it is drain'd of its Nutri∣tious Parts.</NOTE><HI>Faeces,</HI> which fermenting in the <HI>Guts, stimulates</HI> them so as to become a <HI>Purge.</HI> I have often observed, That a <HI>full</HI> Meal of <HI>strong</HI> Meat, as <HI>Fish, Beef, Pork, Baked Meat,</HI> or <HI>made</HI> Dishes, in tender Persons, goes off with the <HI>Hurry</HI> and <HI>Irritation</HI> of a <HI>Purge,</HI> leaving the Bowels <HI>inflated, co∣licked,</HI> or <HI>griped,</HI> and the Spirits <HI>sunk</HI> to the last Degree. The <HI>Food,</HI> by its va∣rious <HI>Mixture, Weight,</HI> and <HI>Fermentation, stimulating</HI> all along from the <HI>Stomach</HI> to the <HI>Rectum,</HI> and being scarce ever drained of its <HI>Chyle,</HI> without affording any Nou∣rishment to the Body, runs off thus crudely, and becomes equal to a total <HI>Abstinence</HI> from Food for a long Time.

The <HI>Statical Chair</HI> invented by <HI>Sanctorius,</HI> for examining the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the <HI>Per∣spiration,</HI> however <HI>ingenious</HI> and <HI>delight∣ful</HI> in <HI>Speculation,</HI> is too <HI>cumbersome</HI> and <HI>laborious</HI> to be of any great Use in <HI>Com∣mon</HI> Life. 'Tis certain, however, that the free and full flowing of this <HI>Evacuation,</HI> is as necessary to <HI>Health</HI> as any of the grosser, since in <HI>Quantity</HI> it is at least equal to both the forementioned; and an <HI>Obstruction</HI> thereof, is generally the Source of all <HI>acute</HI> Diseases, as it is a <HI>Consequence</HI> of all <HI>Chronical</HI> ones. And therefore, I have advised those who are much abroad in <HI>Easterly</HI> and <HI>Northerly</HI> Winds (which most of any obstruct <HI>Perspiration</HI>) and have <HI>Fluxes</HI> of <HI>white</HI> and <HI>pale Water,</HI> to a ready <HI>An∣tidote</HI> to prevent the Beginnings of these <HI>Obstructions.</HI></P>

<HI>tossing,</HI> and <HI>tumbling</HI> abed, are certain Signs that the <HI>Perspiration</HI> is not duly carried on in the <HI>Night Season.</HI> And therefore, in order to remedy this, a greater Proportion of <HI>Exercise,</HI> a greater Degree of <HI>Abstinence,</HI> or some gentle domestick <HI>Purge,</HI> must be had recourse to the next Day. <HI>Colical</HI> Pains, <HI>Gripes</HI> and <HI>Purging,</HI> much <HI>Eructa∣tion</HI> and <HI>Belching</HI> of Wind, <HI>Low Spirited∣ness, Yawning</HI> and <HI>Stretching,</HI> are infalli∣ble <HI>Signs</HI> that the <HI>Perspiration</HI> flows not freely and plentifully then.

<P>There is an <HI>Evacuation</HI> in∣cident to Persons of weak Nerves, which could not conveniently come in
<PB N="133" REF="181"/>
under the general <HI>Division,</HI> because it happens too seldom to make a new Member of it. It is a <HI>Discharge</HI> of thin <HI>Rheum</HI> from the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Mouth, Throat and Stomach, and is called by some, A <HI>Nervous</HI> or <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Spitting. It rises sometimes to the Heighth of a <HI>petit Flux de Bouche,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call it, and threatens some tender Persons, as they apprehend, with a <HI>Consumption,</HI> though it imply nothing less. We may observe some, who are struck with a deep <HI>Palsey,</HI> to flow at the Mouth, and <HI>drivel</HI> down their Breasts; insomuch, that the Afflicted of this <HI>Sort,</HI> who are advanced in Years, can scarce speak intelligibly for the <HI>Flux,</HI> till they have first emptied and cleaned their Mouths. And this arises to so great a Heighth, in some much broken <HI>paralytick</HI> Persons, that upon the slightest Occasions, either of <HI>Joy</HI> or <HI>Grief,</HI> they are apt to run into a <HI>Profusion</HI> of Tears, Sighs and Sobbings. And some sorts of <HI>Ideots,</HI> and those <HI>Hysterically mop'd,</HI> and most of those who suffer from <HI>relaxed</HI> and weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> are more or less subject to these <HI>Salival</HI> Discharges, especially after <HI>Excesses</HI> in <HI>Diet.</HI> Hence the <HI>first</HI> Sort receive the Appellation of <HI>Snivellers</HI> or <HI>Drivellers.</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="182"/>
And the Difficulty of the Cure of all the Diseases of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> depends much on the Quantity and Constitution of this <HI>Flux.</HI> For much and long Spitting and Running off of this <HI>Rheum,</HI> implies a total <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the whole <HI>Nervous System,</HI> and shews neither the first nor second <HI>Concoctions</HI> have been duly performed. I have frequently had Occasion to shew, how <HI>Excesses</HI> in the <HI>Quantity</HI> or <HI>Quality</HI> of the Food, in Persons of <HI>relaxed</HI> and weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> begot a viscid and gross <HI>Chyle,</HI> of which <HI>that Part,</HI> which could not get through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> lay fermenting and putri∣fying in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Passages, begot <HI>Wind, Gripes</HI> and <HI>Colicks,</HI> and at last wrought itself off like a <HI>Purge</HI>; and that <HI>that Part,</HI> which got through the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and was received within the Limits of the <HI>Circulation,</HI> being too gross and glewy to be mixed with the old <HI>Mass</HI> of the <HI>Fluids,</HI> to circulate through the smallest Vessels, and to enter the fine <HI>Perspiratory Glands,</HI> would neces∣sarily be thrown into the wider, more spongy and loose <HI>Salivary Glands,</HI> which are appointed by Nature to secern the more <HI>Glutinous</HI> Parts of the Fluids. And from thence this <HI>Salivary</HI> Inunda∣tion
<PB N="135" REF="183"/>
proceeds. The <HI>Fact</HI> is, When those of weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> commit habitual Ex∣cesses in their <HI>Diet,</HI> the <HI>Glands</HI> and small Vessels of all the Body are <HI>tumified, swelled</HI> and <HI>obstructed</HI> thereby, as they needs must be. And 'tis from the Pressure of these <HI>inlarged Glands,</HI> and the obstructed <HI>capillary</HI> Vessels on the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and patent <HI>Blood Vessels,</HI> that most of the <HI>Evils</HI> they suffer under proceed. But more especially, are the <HI>Glands</HI> appointed to draw off the more viscid serous Part of the Blood, <HI>obstructed</HI> and <HI>tumified</HI> thereby. Upon which Ac∣count, as <HI>Baglivi</HI> advises to enquire well into the State of the <HI>Tongue</HI> and <HI>Mouth,</HI> in order to discover the Con∣dition of the <HI>Stomach, Guts</HI> and <HI>Bowels</HI>; so I think 'tis highly reasonable in a <HI>Chronical</HI> Case, to have great regard to the Condition of the <HI>Eyes</HI>; and if a dead, cold <HI>Languor</HI> be observed in the <HI>Hue</HI> or <HI>Water</HI> of them (as <HI>Jewellers</HI> speak of <HI>Diamonds</HI>) and more especially if the <HI>lachrymal Gland</HI> in the Corner next the Nose, which I always narrowly inspect; if, I say, this <HI>Gland</HI> be found harder, or larger than ordinary, <HI>swelled</HI> and <HI>tumified,</HI> it must certainly be con∣cluded, whatever else be in the Case,
<PB N="136" REF="184"/>
there must be a relaxed State of <HI>Nerves,</HI> much <HI>Vapours,</HI> weak natural <HI>Functions,</HI> and a mismanaged <HI>Regimen.</HI> And it is from the Obstruction and Swelling of this and the other <HI>Glands,</HI> in and about the <HI>Eyes,</HI> and their Pressure upon the <HI>Optical Nerves,</HI> and fine Blood Vessels, that those <HI>Spots, Flies, Atoms, Dimness, Darkness,</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> of Sight, in <HI>Vapourish</HI> and <HI>Hysterical</HI> People proceed. For this <HI>Gland</HI> shews, that the whole <HI>serous Glands</HI> in the upper Regions of the Body are, in Proportion, tumified and swelled with <HI>viscid</HI> Humours through <HI>Excess</HI> of Diet; unless the Person have suffered there by Accident, or labours under some natural Disorders of the <HI>Eyes.</HI> From the Obstruction and Swel∣ling of the <HI>Salivary Glands</HI> in the Mouth, Throat and Gullet, proceed also those <HI>Choakings, Gulping</HI> and <HI>Strangling,</HI> that <HI>Hysterick</HI> Persons so often complain of. The <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Crudities</HI> lodged in their Stomach and Guts, and the rest of the Cavities of the Body pressing to get <HI>vent</HI> upwards, are resisted and stopp'd in their Passage by the <HI>Diaphragm,</HI> where∣by the Inspiration is streightned, and by the Bulk of these <HI>Glands</HI> throughout the Gullet, the Way is intirely stopp'd;
<PB N="137" REF="185"/>
which raises such a <HI>Tumult</HI> and <HI>Struggle,</HI> as produces the mentioned <HI>Symptoms</HI>; which I have not Leisure to detail here more minutely. Now this <HI>Salivation</HI> or Discharge of the thinner <HI>Rheum,</HI> and that <HI>Coughing</HI> and <HI>Hawking</HI> of more viscid <HI>Flegm,</HI> commonly called a <HI>nervous Cough,</HI> as also the <HI>Chincough</HI> of Children, and all such Discharges of sharp <HI>Serum</HI> in Persons of weak and relaxed Nerves, is an <HI>Effort of Nature</HI> to relieve them. And, if discreetly managed, and duly heeded, would prove a <HI>Crise</HI> to their Disorders, and quite free them from their present <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sharpest Part of the suffering Fit of a Disease.</NOTE><HI>Paroxysms,</HI> and set the <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Perspiration,</HI> and conse∣quently the <HI>Spirits,</HI> at Freedom and Liberty again. Some Persons most distractedly run to <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Cordials</HI> to remedy this <HI>Evil,</HI> to stop the Violence of this <HI>Deluge,</HI> and to raise their drooping Spirits. But it serves only to thicken the <HI>Flegm,</HI> shut up the Mouths of the <HI>Salivary</HI> Glands closer, and so to perpetuate the <HI>Evil</HI> they mean to cure. Others devour large Quantities of <HI>high</HI> and <HI>generous Foods,</HI> because they find a

little Relief to their Spirits, from the first <HI>Run</HI> of the sweet, thin, and <HI>spirituous Chyle:</HI> But this is only adding <HI>Fewel</HI> to the <HI>Fire,</HI> and running on in a perpetual Round of <HI>Lowness</HI> and <HI>Slavering.</HI> Where∣as, would they suffer Nature to act her own Way, to carry on this <HI>critical Discharge</HI> as far as it will go, without offering in the least either to check or promote it; but by thin, light Food, and cool Liquors, in moderate, or rather under dosed Quantities, support her in the manner the <HI>Concoctive</HI> Powers are sufficient for; after she had dis∣charged all the <HI>Crudities</HI> from the Mass of the <HI>Fluids,</HI> by these <HI>Emunctory Glands,</HI> and thereby given a free Passage to the <HI>Wind</HI> to escape the Way it tends, the <HI>Salivation</HI> would lessen gradually, and at last stop of itself. And if then towards the <HI>Decline,</HI> a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> to pump up the slow and viscid Remains of the <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Flegm</HI> in the Upper Part of the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Passages, and afterwards a gentle <HI>Stomachick</HI> warm <HI>Purge,</HI> to scour the Lower Part of these <HI>Tubes,</HI> were carefully administred; the <HI>Patient</HI> would soon find a <HI>clear Head, lightsome Spirits,</HI> Ease and Freedom from Pain and Oppression; the <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Perspi∣ration</HI>

would be soon brought to their natural and sound State, and <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Cheerfulness</HI> restored together; unless a mortal or habitual <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spitting.</NOTE><HI>Ptyalism</HI> was the Case, which I have sometimes obser∣ved, as fatal and incurable as a true <HI>Dropsy,</HI> or inveterate <HI>Diabetes</HI>; all which owe their Being to a deep <HI>Scurvy,</HI> whereby the Globular Part of the Blood is intirely <HI>broken,</HI> and the <HI>Serum</HI> made a meer <HI>Lixivium</HI> or Lye.</P>

brought upon them, the <HI>Passions</HI> may be divided into <HI>Acute</HI> and <HI>Chronical,</HI> after the same Manner, and for the same Reason, as <HI>Diseases</HI> are. The <HI>acute Passions,</HI> whether <HI>pleasurable</HI> or <HI>painful,</HI> have much the same <HI>Effect,</HI> and work much after the same <HI>Manner</HI> as <HI>Acute Diseases</HI> do. They effect a brisk and lively <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Fluids, crisp</HI> up and <HI>constrict</HI> the Solids for some short Time. Thus sudden <HI>Gusts</HI> of <HI>Joy</HI> or <HI>Grief, Pleasure</HI> or <HI>Pain,</HI> stimulate and spur the <HI>Nervous</HI> Fibres, and the <HI>Coats</HI> of the <HI>Animal Tubes,</HI> and thereby give a <HI>Celerity</HI> and brisker Motion to their included Fluids, for the same Time. And the <HI>Functions</HI> of the <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Lungs</HI> being <HI>involuntary,</HI> they have their more immediate Effects upon them. Thus both sudden <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> make us <HI>breath</HI> short and quick, and make our <HI>Pulse</HI> small and frequent. The retaining our <HI>Breath</HI> for some Time (for so far our <HI>Breathing</HI> is <HI>volun∣tary</HI>) to reflect more <HI>intensely</HI> upon the painful Object, forces at last a strong <HI>Exspiration,</HI> which becomes a <HI>Sigh.</HI> Thus a sudden painful <HI>Idea,</HI> makes a quicker <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood, and thereby throwing a greater
<PB N="154" REF="202"/>
Quantity thereof upwards, through the <HI>proportionally</HI> larger Branch of the <HI>Aorta,</HI> makes it appear in the superficial Vessels of the <HI>Face, Neck</HI> and <HI>Breast,</HI> and so produces a <HI>Blush</HI>; which, when longer continued, and being very strong, is dispersed over the whole Surface of the Body. Hence the Observation of <HI>Blushing at the Back of one's Hand</HI>; and the Reasons why we <HI>sigh</HI> upon some Occasions, and <HI>blush</HI> upon others, de∣pend upon the different Structure of the <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Pulsation</HI> and <HI>Respiration.</HI> A quick surprizing Pain of Mind acts upon the <HI>Heart,</HI> because the Motion of the Heart is altogether <HI>involuntary:</HI> So that a sudden <HI>Constriction</HI> takes place there immediately to increase the <HI>Pulse.</HI> Whereas we have some Power over the <HI>Breathing</HI>; we can stop or suspend it for a Time; and when we are think∣ing <HI>intensely,</HI> our Attention partly makes us hold our <HI>Breath,</HI> and hence ensues <HI>Sighing</HI> rather than <HI>Blushing.</HI> For the Pain being <HI>slow,</HI> quickens the <HI>Pulse</HI> more gradually: But if it continues long, <HI>both</HI> Actions of <HI>both</HI> Organs are respectively produced; and hence it comes to pass, that upon <HI>Anxiety, Concern</HI> and <HI>earnest Expectation,</HI> the
<PB N="155" REF="203"/>
<HI>Pulse</HI> is found quick and small, and the <HI>Breath</HI> thick and difficult, as Experience shews. The same Principles will account for the Effects of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI> which make us change Colour, and look <HI>red</HI> or <HI>pale,</HI> as the Blood is accelerated or re∣tarded in its Course. The sudden <HI>Gusts</HI> of these Passions being thus ac∣counted for, when they become ex∣treme, they drive about the <HI>Blood</HI> with such a Hurricane, that Nature is over∣set, like a <HI>Mill</HI> by a <HI>Flood:</HI> So that what drove it only quicker round before, now intirely stops it, and renders the Countenance <HI>pale</HI> and <HI>ghastly.</HI> Sudden and great <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Grief,</HI> do so convulse the Nervous <HI>System,</HI> that sometimes they alter the Position of the Parts, and fix them in a new one. Thus the Hair stands on end in a <HI>Fright,</HI> and the whole <HI>System</HI> of the Nerves becomes so <HI>rigid</HI> and <HI>stiff,</HI> as to lose their <HI>Elasticity</HI>; whereby the <HI>Animal</HI> Functions are stopp'd at once; and <HI>Fainting,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Death,</HI> ensues.</P>

<P>To shew yet farther, the In∣fluence of the <HI>Passions</HI> on the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> let us consider the different Constitutions of Men.

hardly possible) in the <HI>Decline</HI> of Life they pay dearly for the greater bodily Pleasures they enjoyed in the Youthful Days of their <HI>Vanity.</HI> Those of <HI>rigid, stiff</HI> and <HI>unyielding</HI> Fibres, have <HI>less vivid Sensations,</HI> because it requires a greater Degree of <HI>Force</HI> to overcome a greater <HI>Resistance.</HI> Those excel most in the <HI>Labours</HI> of the <HI>Understanding,</HI> or the <HI>In∣tellectual</HI> Faculties, retain their <HI>Impres∣sions</HI> longest, and pursue them farthest; and are most susceptible of the slow and lasting <HI>Passions,</HI> which secretly consume them as <HI>chronical</HI> Diseases do. And <HI>Lastly,</HI> Those whose <HI>Organs</HI> of <HI>Sensation</HI> are (if I may speak so) <HI>un-elastick,</HI> or intirely <HI>callous, resty</HI> for want of Ex∣ercise, or any way <HI>obstructed,</HI> or na∣turally <HI>ill-formed,</HI> as they have scarce any <HI>Passions</HI> at all, or any lively Sen∣sations, and are incapable of lasting <HI>Impressions</HI>; so they enjoy the <HI>firmest</HI> Health, and are subject to the fewest <HI>Diseases:</HI> such are <HI>Ideots, Peasants</HI> and <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> and all those we call In∣dolent People.</P>

'Tis the <HI>Ten∣dency, Byass</HI> or <HI>Impulse</HI> of the Minds of Men and other Spirits, toward the most <HI>amiable</HI> Objects, communicated by their <HI>Creator</HI> in their <HI>original Formation,</HI> by virtue of which, they constantly <HI>tend, press</HI> and <HI>urge</HI> to unite (and, if Obstacles were removed, would unite) with one another, and be all united with their <HI>Origin.</HI> This <HI>Principle</HI> indeed, in this <HI>lapsed Estate</HI> of Man (where 'tis over∣laid and buried under <HI>Rubbish,</HI> involved in so many other <HI>Attractions,</HI> and stifled with such <HI>Letts</HI> and <HI>Contrarieties,</HI> that its Action is felt but just enough to know that it is, and wants to be a waked with Labour, and excited with <HI>Violence,</HI> as the Scripture mentions, the <HI>taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Force</HI>) on its first <HI>Developement</HI> and <HI>Expansion,</HI> and in its first Exercises, may be called a Spiritual <HI>Passion,</HI> as 'tis the first Motions, En∣deavours and <HI>Velleities</HI> toward the <HI>Love</HI>

that the Union of the Soul and Body (or <HI>Life,</HI> the so much coveted Good) consists in a kind of <HI>Harmonia praestabilita</HI> (though a kind very different from Mr. <HI>Leibnitz's</HI>) whereby an <HI>harmonious Touch</HI> or Action upon either of them, produces a <HI>pleasurable</HI> Sensation.

<HI>Analogy</HI> of Things; were our <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Supreme Good infinite,</HI> and that to others, in Comparison, <HI>none at all</HI>; we should have but one single View in all our <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> viz.

<P>MENTION having been so often made of <HI>Chronical,</HI> and some∣times of <HI>Acute</HI> Distempers, it may be con∣venient here, to suggest to the Readers, as clear an Account of their Nature and Difference, as I possibly can. <HI>Acute</HI> Distempers, then, are understood, Such as within some short <HI>limited Time</HI> have their Periods, either of a perfect <HI>Crise,</HI> and subsequent Recovery, or of putting an End to the <HI>Distemper</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> both together; and are therefore called
<PB N="173" REF="221"/>
<HI>quick, sharp</HI> or <HI>acute</HI> Distempers, whose Symptoms are more violent, their Dura∣tion shorter, and their Periods more <HI>quick,</HI> either of <HI>sudden Death,</HI> or a glorious <HI>Victory</HI> over the Disease. These are generally limited within <HI>Forty Days.</HI> And those that run out longer, turn into <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, whose Periods are more slow, their <HI>Symptoms</HI> less severe, and their <HI>Duration</HI> longer. They too (if new Fuel were not ad∣ministred to them) would, by the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> and the <HI>Animal Oeconomy,</HI> have their <HI>Periods,</HI> and ter∣minate at the last. The <HI>Viscidity</HI> of the <HI>Juices,</HI> and the <HI>Flaccidity</HI> of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> would, in a great measure, and to some very tolerable Degree, by <HI>proper Reme∣dies,</HI> and a due <HI>Regimen,</HI> be removed, and the Party recover in <HI>these,</HI> as well as <HI>acute</HI> Cases. But this requiring long Time, much Care, and great Caution, unwearied Patience and Perseverance, and so long a Course of <HI>Self-denial,</HI> as few People are willing to undergo, it is become the <HI>Reproach</HI> of <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Physicians,</HI> that <HI>acute</HI> Cases cure them∣selves (or rather Nature cures them) and <HI>chronical</HI> Cases are never cured. But both the Branches of the Reflexion
<PB N="174" REF="222"/>
are equally false. In the First, <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Care,</HI> judiciously applied, will al∣ways <HI>alleviate</HI> the <HI>Symptoms</HI> and Suffer∣ing, will help on Nature to the <HI>Relief</HI> she points out, and quicken the <HI>Crise,</HI> which it will constantly bring about, if the <HI>Distemper</HI> is not too strong for the <HI>Constitution.</HI> And even then it will <HI>mitigate</HI> the <HI>Pain,</HI> and lay the <HI>Patient</HI> gently and easily down. But in the <HI>last Case,</HI> if due Care be had, to follow time∣ously the Advice of an <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>expe∣rienced Physician,</HI> a <HI>Period</HI> certainly may be brought about to most <HI>chronical Di∣stempers,</HI> where the great <HI>Viscera</HI> are not spoiled and destroyed. The Fail∣ing is in the <HI>Patient</HI> himself, who will not, or cannot, <HI>deny himself</HI> for a Time sufficient to bring about the <HI>Cure.</HI> Some <HI>chronical Distempers</HI> indeed are such, either by having gone <HI>too far,</HI> or by being <HI>Hereditary,</HI> and interwoven with the <HI>Principles</HI> of Life, as never to be totally overcome. And then 'tis a Piece of <HI>great Wisdom,</HI> to know how far their Constitution will go, and sit down contented with that <HI>measure of Health</HI> their <HI>original</HI> Frame will admit of. But of this I am morally certain, If the <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Cautions</HI> laid down in this <HI>Treatise,</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="223"/>
be <HI>carefully, steadily,</HI> and <HI>constantly</HI> ob∣served, few <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers but will receive such <HI>Relief</HI> and <HI>Alleviation</HI> by them, as to make Life <HI>tolerably easy,</HI> and free from <HI>grievous Sufferings:</HI> And in the mentioned <HI>Case,</HI> that is all that is left for <HI>Art</HI> to do. But in other <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers taken in <HI>due Time,</HI> where the <HI>Viscera</HI> are not quite spoiled, they would infallibly bring about a <HI>final Period,</HI> and perfect Cure. The most certain distinguishing Mark of an <HI>acute</HI> Distemper, is, To have a <HI>quick Pulse</HI>; that of a <HI>Chronical,</HI> To have a <HI>slow</HI> one. The first will exhaust the <HI>Fluids,</HI> and wear out the <HI>Solids</HI> in a <HI>short</HI> Time; whereas the <HI>last</HI> will require a longer Time to produce the same Effect. Some <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, especially towards the <HI>last</HI> and <HI>fatal</HI> Period, turn <HI>acute.</HI> And some <HI>acute</HI> ones terminate in <HI>chro∣nical</HI> Distempers. But this <HI>Mark</HI> will not only keep them distinct; but also point out, when <HI>acute</HI> Distempers have <HI>chronical</HI> Remissions or Intermissions, and when <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers have <HI>acute</HI> Fits or Paroxysms.</P>

<P>Some Persons, who are ex∣tremely healthy and sound during
<PB N="176" REF="224"/>
their <HI>younger</HI> Days, about, or soon after the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life (that is, about Thirty-five or Thirty-six, ac∣cording to the Observation of an <HI>inspired King</HI>) fall into <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, which cut them off in few Years, or make them miserable all the rest of their Lives. Thus <HI>Consumptions</HI> prove mortal to some about that Time. Thus <HI>Stone</HI> and <HI>Gravel, Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheumatism, Scurvy</HI> and <HI>Dropsy, King's-Evil</HI> and <HI>Skin∣Diseases,</HI> either make their <HI>first</HI> Appear∣ances, or shew themselves in their true <HI>Type</HI> about this Time of Life. The Reason is, While the <HI>Juices</HI> are sweet, sufficiently thin and fluid, but espe∣cially while the <HI>solid</HI> Organs, the <HI>Mem∣branes</HI> and <HI>Fibres,</HI> are yet but <HI>unfolding</HI>; <HI>stretching</HI> and <HI>drawing</HI> out to their full <HI>Dimensions</HI>; any <HI>Acrimony,</HI> Sharpness, or <HI>corroding</HI> Humour, can affect them no other Way, than by making them <HI>vi∣brate,</HI> and so extend themselves farther and farther. For as Pain, so these sharp Salts by their Twitching and <HI>Irri∣tation</HI> on the tender <HI>Fibres,</HI> make them only contract, and so draw at both <HI>Extremities,</HI> and thereby unfold and extend themselves farther. So while the <HI>original Foldings</HI> and <HI>Complications</HI> of
<PB N="177" REF="225"/>
the <HI>Solids</HI> are not yet quite extended, this <HI>Irritation</HI> serves only to draw them out, and does not hurt them, till they are arrived at their full <HI>Extent,</HI> which generally happens about Five-and∣twenty. It takes a <HI>due</HI> Time after that for these <HI>sharp</HI> Humours to <HI>exalt</HI> them∣selves to their utmost <HI>Acrimony,</HI> to cor∣rupt and putrify the Juices, and also some more Time to <HI>wear</HI> out, to ob∣struct and break the great <HI>Organs,</HI> and their smaller <HI>capillary</HI> Vessels. The Sum of all which, brings the <HI>Periods</HI> of the great Attacks of these Distempers to the mentioned <HI>Time</HI> of <HI>Life.</HI> Those in whom the <HI>original Taint</HI> is deeper and more radicated, and the natural Con∣stitution <HI>weaker,</HI> suffer under these At∣tacks <HI>sooner.</HI> And those in whom it is <HI>slighter</HI> and more superficial, and whose Complexion is <HI>stronger</HI> and more <HI>hardy,</HI> hold out <HI>longer.</HI> But the Generality suffer first, <HI>eminently,</HI> about the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life.

And the <HI>Detail</HI> of these general Causes applied to particular Persons, must pro∣duce the <HI>respective</HI> Diseases mentioned. In a Word, The <HI>Scurvy</HI> is a kind of <HI>Catholick</HI> Distemper here in <HI>Britain,</HI> arising from <HI>constant</HI> and <HI>general Causes,</HI> from the <HI>Customs</HI> of the People, and from the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Climate,</HI> which renders the serous Part of the Blood too <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> breaks and divides the Union of the <HI>globulous</HI> Parts, ob∣structs the <HI>small</HI> Vessels, and destroys the <HI>Springiness</HI> and <HI>Elasticity</HI> of the <HI>Fibres.</HI> So that most <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers, can be little else, but <HI>Branches</HI> and <HI>Cions</HI> from this <HI>Root,</HI> which (like <HI>Pandora</HI>'s Box) is so fruitful of Variety of Mis∣chiefs. And its arising from the <HI>Climate</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of the People, is the Rea∣son why <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers are so fre∣quent in <HI>Britain,</HI> to what they are in <HI>warmer Climates</HI> (which, by a <HI>freer Per∣spiration</HI> and <HI>lighter Diet,</HI> not only pre∣vent those <HI>Diseases</HI> in their own <HI>Inhabi∣tants,</HI> but <HI>universally</HI> cure those of our <HI>Island</HI> who are afflicted with them,

if they flee to those <HI>Regions</HI> any <HI>reason∣able Time</HI> before Nature be quite worn out.) For though the Inhabitants of <HI>Britain,</HI> live, for the most part, as <HI>long,</HI> or rather <HI>longer</HI> than those of <HI>warmer</HI> Climates; yet scarce any one, espe∣cially those of the <HI>better</HI> Sort, but be∣comes <HI>crasy,</HI> and suffers under some <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper or other, before they arrive at <HI>old Age.</HI> The same Rea∣son is to be assigned for the Frequency of <HI>Self-murders</HI> here, in <HI>England</HI> espe∣cially, beyond any other Country. For few have <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Resignation</HI> enough, to suffer patiently the lasting Pains of a <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, or the yet more <HI>torturing</HI> and <HI>crucifying Anguish</HI> of a perpetual <HI>Dispiritedness</HI>; though I have observed <HI>generally,</HI> and have good Reason to conclude <HI>universally,</HI> That all <HI>Self-murderers</HI> are first <HI>distracted</HI> and distempered in their <HI>intellectual</HI> Faculties. Notwithstanding the <HI>Diffusiveness</HI> and <HI>Universality</HI> of this Disease, so that scarce a single Individual of the <HI>better</HI> Sort is altogether free from it; yet I never once in my Life, saw it <HI>totally extirpated</HI> in those who had it to any Degree, so as to be intirely free from it all the rest of their Lives after; but that it still ap∣peared,
<PB N="182" REF="230"/>
and sprang up again in some <HI>Symp∣tom</HI> or other, and at last brought forth that <HI>grand one,</HI> which put a <HI>final Period</HI> to all their Sufferings. One good Reason for this is, That it requires a <HI>Regimen</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> so intirely <HI>contrary</HI> and <HI>op∣posite</HI> to the <HI>natural Habits</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> and the universal <HI>Bent</HI> and <HI>Appetites</HI> of the Inhabitants of this <HI>Island,</HI> that it be∣comes a kind of perpetual <HI>Self-denial</HI> to them; which the <HI>British Nation,</HI> in general, does not mightily admire. Another Reason is, That <HI>fine Folks</HI> use their <HI>Physicians,</HI> as they do their <HI>Laun∣dresses,</HI> send their Linen to them to be cleaned, in order only to be dirtied again. Nothing less than a very mo∣derate Use of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and that of the Kind which abounds least in <HI>urinous Salts</HI> (as most certainly the young and the lighter-coloured do) and a more moderate use of <HI>Spirituous Liquors, due Labour</HI> and <HI>Exercise,</HI> and a careful guarding against the <HI>Inconstancy</HI> and <HI>Inclemency</HI> of the <HI>Seasons,</HI> can keep this <HI>Hydra</HI> under. And nothing else than a <HI>total Abstinence</HI> from <HI>animal Foods,</HI> and <HI>strong fermented Liquors,</HI> can totally ex∣tirpate it. And that, too, must be be∣gun
<PB N="183" REF="231"/>
early; before, or soon after the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life; or else there will re∣main too little <HI>Oil</HI> in the <HI>Lamp,</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> will sink too far, ever to be re∣covered again; and the remaining Part of Life, will be too short for so total a Change as must be made. So that those who suffer greatly under this <HI>British</HI> Distemper, must be contented to <HI>bear</HI> and <HI>forbear,</HI> a little, and must expect no greater <HI>Degree of Health,</HI> than their <HI>Time of Life,</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> of their Disease, and the State of their <HI>Constitu∣tion</HI> will admit of. But still a great Moderation in <HI>animal Foods,</HI> and <HI>spiritu∣ous and fermented Liquors, due Exercise,</HI> and a Care to fence against the <HI>Injuries</HI> of the Weather, will make Life tolera∣bly easy; especially if some gentle domestick <HI>Purges</HI> be interspersed. The <HI>Seeds</HI> and young <HI>Sprouts</HI> of Vegetables, have scarce any gross, <HI>fix'd,</HI> or <HI>essential Salts</HI> at all in them. This is not only evident from the Reasons formerly given (because they are young, or the Nourishment appointed by Nature for young Vegetables; for the <HI>Earth</HI> is only a proper <HI>Nest</HI> or <HI>Matrix</HI> for them; and the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat serves them in∣stead

Hence it comes to pass, that a <HI>vegetable</HI> Diet for a few Weeks or Months, together with drinking Water or unfermented Liquors (such as <HI>Tea, Coffee, Barley-Water, Liquorice-Water, Teas</HI> made of <HI>Oranges,</HI> or other Seeds and Plants) will fasten the Teeth when dropping out, from a <HI>Consumption</HI> of the <HI>Gums</HI> by <HI>scorbutick Salts,</HI> cure any <HI>cutaneous Foulnesses</HI> or <HI>Eruptions,</HI> and even any spreading <HI>Ulcer,</HI> if it is not <HI>Scrofulous,</HI> when no

Medicine on the Face of the Earth will touch it. Hence the grand <HI>Maxim</HI> in the Cure of all <HI>Ulcers</HI> is, by <HI>Diet</HI> to bring them to the State of a <HI>Wound,</HI> and then they will cure of them∣selves. And, as I have elsewhere ob∣served, there is scarce a <HI>thin, consump∣tive, hysterick</HI> or <HI>hypochondriack,</HI> and weakly Constitution in <HI>England,</HI> which has not for its Parent, a latent or manifest <HI>scorbutick Cachexy,</HI> excepting that which arises from a <HI>Scrofula.</HI> From the whole we may gather, how much a <HI>proper Regimen</HI> of <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>due Exercise,</HI> with the other <HI>Helps</HI> and <HI>Remedies</HI> already mentioned in this <HI>Treatise,</HI> is able to do in most <HI>British chronical</HI> Distempers.</P>

<P>Having had so often Occasion to speak of weak and relaxed Nerves, it will not be amiss to <HI>suggest,</HI> some of the outward and most sensible <HI>Signs</HI> and <HI>Characters,</HI> whereby it may be manifest, whether <HI>one's self,</HI> or any <HI>particular</HI> Per∣son he is concerned for, be of this <HI>Make</HI> and <HI>Constitution,</HI> before some <HI>chronical</HI> Distemper, or other dismal <HI>Symptom</HI> has made it plain; in order to prevent <HI>these</HI> as far as possible. To which purpose we must observe, that the <HI>Nerves</HI> are
<PB N="186" REF="234"/>
Bundles of <HI>solid, springy,</HI> and <HI>elastick</HI> Threads or <HI>Filaments</HI> (like twisted <HI>Cat∣Guts</HI> or <HI>Hairs</HI>) whose one <HI>Extremity</HI> is terminated at the <HI>common Sensory</HI> in the <HI>Brain,</HI> where the <HI>Soul</HI> is supposed to reside; the <HI>other</HI> is interwoven into every Point of the <HI>Scarf-skin,</HI> the <HI>Mem∣branes,</HI> the <HI>Coats</HI> of the <HI>Vessels,</HI> the <HI>Muscles</HI> and the other <HI>sensible Solids</HI> of the Body, in order to convey the <HI>Motions, Actions, Vibrations</HI> or <HI>Impulses</HI> of out∣ward <HI>Objects</HI> to the <HI>Soul.</HI> These <HI>Threads</HI> or <HI>Filaments</HI> are highly <HI>elastick</HI> or <HI>springy,</HI> as we may see from their hardned Sub∣stances, such as <HI>Whalebone, Ivory, Horn</HI> and <HI>Cartileges,</HI> which are more eminently <HI>so</HI> than any other Bodies known. Some Persons have their <HI>Fibres</HI> very <HI>quick,</HI> readily <HI>vibrating,</HI> highly <HI>springy</HI> and <HI>elastick,</HI> so as to <HI>tremble</HI> and <HI>shake</HI> violent∣ly, by the least <HI>Impulse.</HI> Others have more <HI>rigid, firm,</HI> and <HI>stretched Fibres,</HI> which yield not but to strong <HI>Impres∣sions,</HI> and move slowly, but move for a long Time. <HI>Lastly,</HI> There are those who have <HI>weak, loose, slender</HI> and <HI>relaxed Fibres,</HI> which though easily moved, and yielding to the weakest <HI>Impulse,</HI> yet communicate only <HI>imperfect, languid</HI> and <HI>faint Impressions</HI> and <HI>Vibrations</HI> to
<PB N="187" REF="235"/>
the <HI>Soul,</HI> and have all their other <HI>Animal Functions</HI> of the same <HI>languishing</HI> Nature. And 'tis of these last, I have been all along speaking. And we may readily discover them, by these out∣ward <HI>Characters</HI> and <HI>Signs.</HI> 1. Those who have naturally <HI>soft, thin, small</HI> and <HI>short Hair,</HI> are of a <HI>loose, flabby,</HI> and <HI>relaxed</HI> State of <HI>Nerves.</HI> For the <HI>Hair</HI> seems to be some of the fleshy <HI>Fibres,</HI> only lengthen'd outwards and harden'd. At least, like the <HI>Fibres,</HI> they consist of a great many lesser <HI>Filaments</HI> con∣tained in a common <HI>Membrane,</HI> are <HI>solid, transparent</HI> and <HI>elastick:</HI> And as these Hairs are in <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Bulk,</HI> so generally the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body are. 2. Those of the <HI>fairest Hair,</HI> are of the <HI>loosest Fibres</HI> (other Things being equal) because the <HI>Fairest</HI> are more <HI>rare, porous</HI> and <HI>fungous</HI>; And because Bodies of the <HI>lighter</HI> Colours, consist of <HI>smaller</HI> Parts, than those of the more flaming Colours; as has been formerly obser∣ved. 3. Those of large or (as they are called) <HI>mastiff Muscles.</HI> and of <HI>big Bones,</HI> are generally of a firmer State of <HI>Nerves,</HI> than those of <HI>little Muscles</HI> and <HI>Bones.</HI> Because the <HI>Muscles</HI> and <HI>Bones</HI> being <HI>similar</HI> to their <HI>Fibres,</HI> as is highly
<PB N="188" REF="236"/>
probable, and these being <HI>bigger,</HI> and consequently stronger, so must those be; and on the contrary. 4. <HI>Soft, yielding, pappy</HI> Flesh, is a sure <HI>Symptom</HI> of <HI>loose Fibres</HI>; whereas <HI>hard, firm</HI> and <HI>un∣yielding Muscles,</HI> are the constant Sign of <HI>firm Fibres.</HI> 5. A <HI>white, fair, blanch'd</HI> or <HI>ashen</HI>-coloured <HI>Complexion</HI> or <HI>Skin,</HI> constantly indicates a <HI>weaker</HI> and more <HI>relaxed</HI> State of <HI>Fibres,</HI> than a <HI>ruddy, fresh, dark sallow</HI> or <HI>black Hue</HI>; for Reasons already given. 6. A fat, <HI>cor∣pulent</HI> and <HI>flegmatick</HI> Constitution, is al∣ways attended with <HI>loose, flabby</HI> and <HI>re∣laxed Fibres,</HI> by their being dissolved and <HI>oversoaked</HI> in <HI>Moisture</HI> and <HI>Humidity.</HI> And, on the contrary, those of a <HI>dry, clean</HI> and <HI>firm Make,</HI> have <HI>strong, firm</HI> and <HI>tense Fibres.</HI> 7. Those who are subject to <HI>Evacuations</HI> of any kind, in any Degree greater than what is na∣tural; and those who by any <HI>Accident,</HI> have suffered long by any <HI>preternatural Evacuation</HI> whatsoever, are, or become of <HI>loose, relaxed Fibres</HI> and <HI>Nerves.</HI> Thus those who frequently run into <HI>Purging,</HI> or <HI>Floods</HI> of pale <HI>Water, flow</HI> at the Mouth or Nose, or <HI>melt</HI> into profuse <HI>Sweats,</HI> those who any Way have lost much <HI>Blood,</HI> have had a <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> have recovered of
<PB N="189" REF="237"/>
a <HI>Fever,</HI> and those of the <HI>Sex</HI> who have <HI>purified</HI> longer or more than is usual; all of these, are <HI>originally,</HI> or become <HI>acci∣dentally,</HI> of <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>relaxed Nerves</HI> and <HI>Fibres.</HI> 8. <HI>Lastly,</HI> Those who are of a <HI>cold Constitution,</HI> are apt to run into <HI>Coldnesses</HI> on their <HI>Extremities,</HI> or ready to catch <HI>Cold,</HI> are also of <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>loose Fibres</HI> and <HI>Nerves:</HI> because these are Signs of a <HI>slow</HI> and <HI>interrupted Circulation</HI> and <HI>Perspiration</HI>; which manifests a weak <HI>Spring</HI> in the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Coats</HI> of the <HI>Vessels,</HI> the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the <HI>Muscles,</HI> and a Weakness of the <HI>Spring</HI> of the <HI>Scales</HI> of the <HI>Scarf-skin.</HI></P>

<P>On this Occasion of rehearsing the Signs of weak Nerves, I cannot omit <HI>apprising</HI> those of the breeding Part of the <HI>Sex,</HI> and those who are concerned in them, of their Readiness of <HI>Miscarrying,</HI> unless duly tended and ma∣naged, especially those of them of <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>weak Nerves,</HI> or of too <HI>delicate</HI> a <HI>Con∣stitution.</HI> The Signs I have now laid down, will always make it evident, if any <HI>particular</HI> Person is so or not. And if upon <HI>Examination</HI> they be found to be <HI>such,</HI> they will be apt, upon the slightest Occasion, to run into frequent
<PB N="190" REF="238"/>
<HI>Miscarriages</HI>; whereby a great Part of their <HI>Posterity</HI> will be destroyed, and they themselves exposed to <HI>Dropsies</HI> or <HI>Con∣sumptions,</HI> or (which is worse than either) perpetual <HI>Lowness</HI> of <HI>Spirits, Vapours</HI> and other <HI>Hysterick</HI> Disorders. And by this Misfortune alone, a considerable Part of the <HI>better Sort</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> perish and are lost. <HI>Nature</HI> has formed the Generality of the Sex, of a <HI>soft, slender,</HI> and <HI>delicate Make.</HI> Want of due <HI>Exer∣cise,</HI> a full <HI>Table,</HI> indiscreet <HI>Nurses,</HI> over∣fond <HI>Mothers,</HI> and <HI>Hereditary</HI> Sharp∣nesses, make them much more so. And if by <HI>Neglect</HI> or <HI>Accident,</HI> they once begin to <HI>miscarry,</HI> every <HI>first Miscarriage</HI> paves the Way for a <HI>second,</HI> and a <HI>third,</HI> and so on, till the <HI>poor, pretty Creature,</HI> has neither <HI>Blood</HI> nor <HI>Spirits, Appetite</HI> nor <HI>Digestion</HI> left. For one Miscarriage weakens the <HI>Constitution,</HI> breaks and tears the <HI>nervous System</HI> more, than two <HI>ma∣ture Births.</HI> If ever this is to be secured or prevented effectually, 'tis to be done, at least attempted, in the <HI>first Instance,</HI> if possible, at least as soon as may be, before a total <HI>Relaxation</HI> and <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the <HI>nervous System</HI> is brought on. The <HI>Giddiness, Romping,</HI> and <HI>Gadding</HI> about of the young Crea∣ture
<PB N="191" REF="239"/>
herself, is often the Cause of her <HI>Miscarriage.</HI> But oftner the <HI>Forwardness</HI> and <HI>Indiscretion</HI> of <HI>Surgeons</HI> and <HI>Midwives,</HI> by <HI>bleeding</HI> on every little threatning <HI>Symptom,</HI> without considering the <HI>Con∣stitution. Bleeding</HI> may do well enough in <HI>sanguine, robust,</HI> and <HI>plethorick</HI> Consti∣tutions: But 'tis <HI>Death</HI> and certain <HI>Rain</HI> to those of <HI>slender</HI> and weak <HI>Nerves,</HI> and the surest <HI>Way</HI> to cause the <HI>Miscarriage</HI> 'tis designed to prevent, by <HI>relaxing</HI> the <HI>Nervous</HI> Fibres; which <HI>Bleeding</HI> does as certainly, as it lessens the <HI>Quantity</HI> of the <HI>Blood.</HI> The most effectual <HI>Method</HI> I have ever found to prevent such <HI>Misfortunes,</HI> is, To order those in such Circumstances, to drink plentifully <HI>Bristol Water,</HI> with a very little <HI>red Wine,</HI> for their <HI>constant Drink</HI>; to lay the <HI>Plaister ad Herniam,</HI> with <HI>Oil</HI> of <HI>Cinnamon,</HI> and <HI>London Laudanum,</HI> in a due Proportion, to their <HI>Reins</HI>; to keep them to a <HI>low, light, easily digested Diet,</HI> especially of the <HI>farinaceous Vegetables,</HI> and <HI>milk Meats</HI>; to strengthen their Bowels, with <HI>Diascordium</HI> and <HI>toasted Rhubarb,</HI> if they become too <HI>slippery</HI>; to <HI>air</HI> them once or twice a Day, in a <HI>Coach</HI> or <HI>Chair,</HI> and to keep them <HI>cheer∣ful,</HI> and in good <HI>Humour,</HI> as much as
<PB N="192" REF="240"/>
may be. This <HI>Method</HI> will scarce ever fail, unless a latent <HI>Scrofula,</HI> or some other <HI>Hereditary Sharpnesses</HI> in their <HI>Juices,</HI> destroy the <HI>Birth.</HI></P>

Nothing but <HI>Superfluity</HI> in <HI>Food</HI> or <HI>strong Liquors,</HI> requires <HI>Sweating:</HI> And that is the <HI>Reason,</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> run so much upon it.

<P>To the <HI>Aged,</HI> and those who are passing off the <HI>Stage</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> I have only <HI>two</HI> Things to recommend, if they would make the <HI>last Hour,</HI> as <HI>easy, in∣dolent</HI> and <HI>free</HI> from <HI>Pain</HI> as may be. The <HI>first</HI> is, That they would avoid the <HI>Injuries</HI> of the <HI>Weather,</HI> as much as ever they can. The <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Aged</HI> is ever most certainly <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>viscid.</HI> Their <HI>Perspiration</HI> little or none at all; and their <HI>concoctive</HI> Powers <HI>weak.</HI> And consequently, they must be <HI>subjected</HI> to, and suffer by the weakest <HI>Injuries</HI> of the <HI>Weather.</HI> Therefore I advise <HI>such,</HI> to keep <HI>Home,</HI> provide <HI>warm Rooms</HI> and <HI>Beds,</HI> and good <HI>Fires,</HI> whenever the <HI>Sky lowrs, Winds blow,</HI> or the <HI>Air</HI> is <HI>sharp.</HI> Such are not to expect to <HI>raise, improve,</HI> or <HI>exalt</HI> their <HI>Constitutions</HI> or <HI>Health. Freedom</HI> from <HI>Pain,</HI> to prevent the <HI>vital Flame</HI>'s being extinguished by <HI>Accidents,</HI> and to have it <HI>burn</HI> as clear, and as long as Nature, at their <HI>Age,</HI> has designed it should, is all they ought to <HI>aim</HI> at. <HI>Exercise</HI> is only to purge off <HI>Superfluities.</HI> If <HI>these</HI> therefore, be care∣ful not to <HI>exceed,</HI> they will want none, nor would it much contribute to their <HI>Ease.</HI> For in old Men the <HI>Bones petrify</HI>;
<PB N="206" REF="254"/>
the <HI>Cartilages</HI> and <HI>Tendons</HI> turn into <HI>Bones</HI>; and the <HI>Muscles</HI> and <HI>Nerves,</HI> into <HI>Cartilages</HI> and <HI>Tendons.</HI> And all the <HI>Solids</HI> lose their <HI>Elasticity,</HI> and turn, in a great measure, into that <HI>Earth</HI> they are going to be <HI>dissolved</HI> into. So that the <HI>Solids</HI> wanting <HI>Elasticity, Exercise</HI> can do but little to <HI>shake</HI> off the <HI>Load.</HI> It will therefore be <HI>enough</HI> for <HI>such,</HI> to air themselves when the <HI>Sun</HI> lights them, and the <HI>Summer</HI> Breezes can <HI>refresh</HI> them. Or, if they would lengthen out their <HI>Days,</HI> to remove to a warmer <HI>Climate,</HI> by which they may live as long as the <HI>Crow.</HI> The <HI>second</HI> Thing I would advise <HI>such,</HI> is, To lessen their <HI>Diet gradually,</HI> as they grow <HI>older,</HI> before <HI>Nature</HI> has forced this <HI>Diminution</HI> upon them. This is a powerful Mean to make their old Age <HI>green</HI> and <HI>indolent,</HI> and to preserve the <HI>Remains</HI> of their <HI>Senses</HI> to the very last. By this alone, <HI>Cornaro</HI> length∣ned out his <HI>Days,</HI> and preserved his <HI>Senses,</HI> in a great measure, intire to a <HI>hundred Years.</HI> He gradually lessened his <HI>Diet</HI> so far, that, as his <HI>Historian</HI> informs us, he came at last to live on the <HI>Yolk of an Egg</HI> three Days. I will not take upon me to advise others,
<PB N="207" REF="255"/>
in what <HI>Measure,</HI> either of Time or Quantity of <HI>Food,</HI> they ought to <HI>diminish.</HI> But this, I think, they ought to con∣sider, That since 'tis certain aged <HI>Per∣sons</HI> become <HI>Children,</HI> as to the <HI>Weakness</HI> of their <HI>Digestions,</HI> they ought to <HI>di∣minish,</HI> as <HI>Children</HI> increase in their Food, from <HI>weaker</HI> to <HI>weaker,</HI> and from <HI>less</HI> to <HI>less.</HI> For as their <HI>Solids</HI> are <HI>unela∣stick,</HI> their <HI>concoctive Powers</HI> weak, their <HI>Perspiration</HI> little, and the <HI>Expences</HI> of Living scarce any, their <HI>Repairs</HI> (not to <HI>overlay</HI> the <HI>Spark</HI> of <HI>Life</HI> remaining) ought to lessen <HI>proportionally.</HI> And 'tis to the Neglect of this, in <HI>aged Persons,</HI> that those <HI>Rheums, Catarrhs, Wind</HI> and <HI>Colicks,</HI> Loss of <HI>Memory</HI> and <HI>Senses,</HI> those <HI>Aches</HI> and <HI>Pains,</HI> and all that <HI>dismal and black Train of Miseries,</HI> that wait on <HI>Long Life,</HI> is mostly owing.

their Inconstancy, and Impatience of being confined in their Appetites, makes them either throw off all Remedies and Restraints in Despair, and give themselves up to an <HI>habitual</HI> Indul∣gence in all those Things that brought on or exasperated the Distemper, or run about changing, from Doctor to Doctor, till they end with a <HI>Quack,</HI> or die under the Hands of a <HI>Mountebank,</HI> and are <HI>fool'd</HI> out of their Lives and Money at once.

by Retrenching, Management or Saving, even joining to those <HI>Day-labour,</HI> that a <HI>few</HI> Months or Years would recover all, and bring his Estate to its first Condition.

If he gives over <HI>Saving,</HI> he must at last most certainly starve or go to Gaol; and if he begins to save in due Time, he will certainly <HI>retrieve</HI> all; but the whole consists in <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Saving</HI> for a <HI>due Time.

New Doctors must be had, and they must either be cashier'd if they pursue the same Inten∣tions (which, if they be honest Men, they must do) or else must write Things that can neither do Good nor Harm, or those which will actually hurt, for their Fees (for there is no <HI>Medium</HI>) till the miserable Person has run thro' the whole Faculty; and at last got into the <HI>Charlatan</HI> Tribe. It is certain, that when Nature has begun to throw the gross and viscid Parts of the Juices on those loose and spungy Glands, it will continue so to do, till it has deflegmated the whole Mass; and every new Vomit will make Room for another; and there is no other Remedy as long as
<PB N="212" REF="260"/>
there is any viscid Humour remaining, nor can the Decline of the Disease be discovered so certainly by any Thing, as by the Lessening of the Quantity ex∣cerned, and the Lengthening of the In∣tervals: As in a Vessel of Oil and Water incorporated, a sure Way to se∣parate the Oil from the Water is, to skim it off as it comes to the Top. Now <HI>as long</HI> as there is any Oil remaining it will swim, if you but give it Time to ex∣tricate itself from the Embraces of the <HI>Water,</HI> and then you may separate the vis∣cid Mixture intirely. No great Purpose in Life was ever brought about, but by <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> and by constantly <HI>pursuing</HI> the most natural and best ap∣proved Means that lead towards that End. Nature works not by sudden Jumps and Starts, but goes on steadily, <HI>fortement &amp; doucement,</HI> and 'tis Nature that is the true Physician: Art only re∣moves Obstacles, checks Violences, and gently sollicites Nature the Way she tends. This requires <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Pa∣tience. Tempus edax Rerum.</HI> It most cer∣tainly consumes chronical Diseases, if not fuelled and fed; <HI>Nothing else</HI> can.</P>

<P>In fine, Providence has been kind and gracious to us beyond all Ex∣pression, in furnishing us with a certain <HI>Relief,</HI> if not a Remedy, even to our most <HI>intense Pains</HI> and <HI>extreme Miseries.</HI> When our Patience can hold out no longer, and our Pains are at last come to be <HI>insupportable,</HI> we have always ready at Hand a Medicine, which is not only a present Relief, but, I may say, a standing and <HI>constant Miracle.</HI> Those only who have wanted it most, and have felt its friendly and kind Help in their Tortures, can best tell its <HI>wonderful Effects,</HI> and the great <HI>Goodness</HI> of Him who has bestowed it on us. I mean <HI>Opium,</HI> and its Solution <HI>Laudanum,</HI> which, when properly prescribed, and prudently managed, is a most <HI>certain</HI> and <HI>sudden</HI> Relief in all <HI>exquisite</HI> and <HI>intense</HI> Pain. The <HI>Manner of its Ope∣ration</HI> may be gathered, from the Ob∣servations I have made in the preceding Treatise. Pain constricts, crisps up, shortens and contracts animal Fibres. It acts like a Wedge in tearing, rending and dividing these small Filaments; it does to them in a living Body, what the Points of Salts do to all animal Sub∣stances,
<PB N="214" REF="262"/>
which are to be preserved for Food, <HI>viz.</HI> hardens, stiffens and con∣tracts them. The Fibres of live Ani∣mals being contractile, tonick and springy, when a hard pointed Body enters them (which is the Case in all bodily Pain) the Parts by their con∣tractile Nature, fly from, recede, and shun, as much as possibly they can, the wounding Instrument. This ap∣pears in the large Gash of a Wound, made across the Fibres of a Muscle; in the continual Bending towards the other Side, when any Part of one is pained; in the <HI>Cramps</HI> and <HI>Con∣vulsions,</HI> nay, and sometimes <HI>Fevers,</HI> produced by intense <HI>acute Pain.</HI> Plea∣sure, on the contrary, <HI>relaxes</HI> the Fibres by a gentle, soft, and bland, or (as the <HI>Mathematicians</HI> speak) a commensurate and harmonious Touch. It acts on the Fibres as two unison and concordant mu∣sical Instruments act on one another, and by stroaking, softening and smoothing, comes at last intirely to relax and un∣bend them. The Parts of the Fibres run after, follow and pursue, and at last break their Union in some Degree, to reach such a demulcent Touch. Some Persons have had the Faculty to
<PB N="215" REF="263"/>
allay Pain, by gently smoothing the afflicted Part with their Hands; which in some Measure was true of the <HI>Touching Doctor.</HI> Soft Oils, and emol∣lient Herbs, with gentle Warmth, by <HI>relaxing</HI> the crisped Fibres, will allay <HI>Pain.</HI> Soft Beds and Cloaths, and tepid Baths will relax and weaken the whole Habit. Now since Pain so cer∣tainly crisps up, constricts and <HI>contracts</HI> animal Fibres, and since <HI>Opiates</HI> in∣fallibly, if duly dosed, relieve and <HI>ease</HI> Pain, I can see no possible Way it can effect that, but by <HI>relaxing</HI> and <HI>un∣bending</HI> these Fibres as much, or near as much, as Pain contracts and draws them up. And that this is the real Fact, we may observe from many Effects of <HI>Opiates.</HI> 1. Nothing is so powerful, or so certain a <HI>Diaphoretick</HI> as an <HI>Opiate.</HI> Nothing causes such plenti∣ful Sweating, especially if joined with <HI>Volatiles,</HI> and promoted with plentiful drinking small, warm Liquors. This it can do only by relaxing the Fibres of the Skin and Perspiratory Glands. 2. Nothing so much <HI>palls</HI> the <HI>Appetite,</HI> and <HI>weakens</HI> the first <HI>Digestions,</HI> as the frequent Use of <HI>Opiates</HI>; insomuch, that most People, after a liberal Dose of
<PB N="216" REF="264"/>
them, seldom fail to reach, and never care for Food for a considerable Time after, till their Effects are wrought off; which are the constant Symptoms of a <HI>relaxed Stomach and Guts.</HI> 3. Nothing so much promotes the <HI>Eruption</HI> of the Small-Pox and Measles, the <HI>Expulsion</HI> of the Stone and Foetus, the Monthly, and the After-Birth <HI>Purifications</HI> of the Sex, as <HI>Opiates</HI>; insomuch, that in dif∣ficult Births, they are now the only Resource of the Midwife Physicians; and, when joined with <HI>Volatiles,</HI> will bring on the most powerful and <HI>vigorous</HI> Throws, in the most weak and <HI>lan∣guishing</HI> Constitutions. These Effects they can produce only by <HI>relaxing</HI> those Fibres Pain has <HI>contracted</HI> and render'd unelastick in some measure. 4. No∣thing quiets and stops <HI>Cramps, Convul∣sions</HI> and <HI>Hysterick</HI> Fits, so suddenly and certainly as <HI>Opiates</HI> do. And every one knows these arise from violent Con∣tractions, and crisping up of the mus∣cular Fibres. All these, and many more such Effects, <HI>Opiates</HI> produce, by <HI>unbending, loosening,</HI> and <HI>relaxing</HI> those Fibres violent and acute Pain had con∣stricted and <HI>contracted,</HI> and by giving a Respite and Reprieve from its Tortures,
<PB N="217" REF="265"/>
and thereby allowing Nature (the only true Physician) to go undisturbed about its own Work. The Way it stops Purging, and cures a <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> I take to be by carrying off the sharp and watry Humours in the Bowels by <HI>Perspiration,</HI> which <HI>Opium</HI> exceedingly promotes; by quieting those <HI>Spasms</HI> and <HI>Convulsions,</HI> and allaying those <HI>Stimula∣tions</HI> excited by Purging; and settling and calming the Violence of the <HI>Peri∣staltick</HI> Motion of the Guts, which <HI>hurries off</HI> their Contents. I will not take upon me here, to determine the proper Cases for <HI>Opiates,</HI> or their <HI>Doses.</HI> That is the Business of the Physician. But in general I may say, Wherever Pain is <HI>acute, intolerable</HI> and <HI>past</HI> endu∣ring, where it may indanger <HI>Convulsions,</HI> a <HI>Fever</HI> or <HI>Inflammation</HI>; after premising the proper universal <HI>Evacuations</HI> (such as Bleeding, Blistering, Cupping, Purging or Glistering, as the Case re∣quires, or will bear) <HI>Opiates</HI> then will most certainly relieve, and may be safely administred. If the Case is at∣tended with <HI>Vomiting,</HI> solid <HI>Opium</HI> will do best; because it will be in a smaller Volume, and will not be so readily re∣jected. If speedy Relief be required
<PB N="218" REF="266"/>
where there is no Vomiting, then <HI>Laudanum</HI> will disperse soonest through the Habit, because <HI>Liquid,</HI> and joined with a Spirituous Vehicle will <HI>soonest</HI> effect the Design, raise the oppressed Spirits more, and penetrate deeper and quicker. In common Cases a vinous Vehicle will be sufficient, because <HI>Opium</HI> is best dissolved in Wine, to make <HI>Laudanum.</HI> There are <HI>four Cases,</HI> in which 'tis absolutely and eminently necessary; the <HI>Cholick</HI>; the <HI>Stone</HI>; the hard <HI>Labours,</HI> After-Birth and Monthly sluggish <HI>Purifications</HI> of the Sex, espe∣cially if attended with violent Pain, as is common in such Cases; and in the <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Rheumatism.</HI> In the <HI>first,</HI> it ought always to be given with some Stomach Purge, as <HI>Elixir Salutis,</HI> or <HI>Tincture</HI> of <HI>Hiera Picra,</HI> with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Buckthorn,</HI> and in those of more tender Bowels, with <HI>Tincture</HI> of <HI>Rhubarb</HI>; espe∣cially if the Cholick is in the lower Bowels and attended with no Vomiting; in which Case an artificial Vomit is to be premised, if Circumstances forbid it not. In the <HI>Stone</HI> it ought to be given with <HI>Oil</HI> of sweet <HI>Almonds,</HI> or in some soft <HI>Emulsion,</HI> to lubricate the Parts. In the <HI>two last</HI> Cases, it ought always to
<PB N="219" REF="267"/>
be given with proper <HI>Volatiles, Anti∣hystericks</HI> and <HI>Attenuants.</HI> In violent and acute Pain, the first Dose ought to be large, at least from <HI>thirty</HI> to <HI>forty-five</HI> Drops of liquid <HI>Laudanum,</HI> or its Equi∣valent in <HI>Opium,</HI> from <HI>two</HI> Grains and a half, to <HI>three</HI> and a half; and after∣wards to be increased by <HI>fifteen</HI> Drops of Liquid, or half a Grain of solid <HI>Laudanum</HI> every half Hour, till the Pain begin to remit; and then an intire stop is to be put to its Administration. And thus the End will be obtained without any Fear of <HI>over-dosing.</HI> And the Truth is, there is less Hazard of that, than Persons are aware. For those who die of an Over-dose of <HI>Laudanum</HI> in the <HI>Opinion of the World,</HI> would have lived few Days without it. For there are those that by Custom, have brought themselves to <HI>two Drams</HI> of solid, that is, near <HI>six Ounces</HI> of liquid <HI>Laudanum</HI> a Day. And I know a Gentleman who took near <HI>three Ounces</HI> at once, instead of <HI>Elixir Salutis,</HI> and had <HI>never</HI> taken any in his Life <HI>before</HI>; who (though it extreamly weakened his Stomach for some Time, and that he dosed almost a Month under it) yet <HI>did well,</HI> and, for ought I know, is alive
<PB N="220" REF="268"/>
still, though it be many Years since. If the preceding Dose be rejected by Vomiting, about a Third Part may be supposed to stay; and then the subse∣quent Doses may be proportioned ac∣cordingly. The Difference of Consti∣tutions will make no great Alteration here, since very <HI>weak</HI> Persons seldom suffer very <HI>violent</HI> Pain, which is the only Case I am here considering.</P>

<P>To draw towards a Con∣clusion. The <HI>Grand Secret</HI> and Sole Mean of Long Life, is to keep the Blood and Juices in a due State of Thinness and <HI>Fluidity,</HI> whereby they may be able to make those Rounds and Circulations through the animal Fibres, wherein Life and Health consist, with the fewest Rubs and least Resistance that may be. In spite of all we can do, Time and Age will <HI>fix</HI> and <HI>stiffen</HI> our <HI>Solids.</HI> Our original Frame and Make renders this unavoidable and necessary. As in the <HI>greater</HI> World, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Sir <HI>Isaac Newton</HI>'s Princip.</NOTE>Quan∣tity of the Fluids is Daily lessening and decreasing; so in our <HI>lesser</HI> World after
<PB N="221" REF="269"/>
a limited Time, the Appetite and Concoctions failing, the <HI>Fluids</HI> are lessened and spent on the continual Re∣pairs of the Solids, and thereby lose their Nature, and become firm and hard. For by insinuating themselves into all the Pores of the <HI>Solids,</HI> and the Interstices of their Parts, and straitening and damming up the small Vessels, which carry in Nourishment to the in∣ternal Substance of the Solids, and so depriving them of their <HI>Moisture</HI> and Lubricating Juices, these Solids come at last to harden, stiffen and fix, and thereby lose their <HI>Elasticity</HI> and Springi∣ness. Here the Process is <HI>Mechanical</HI> and <HI>Necessary.</HI> Age and Time, by weakning the Concoctions, impairing the natural Heat, which consists in a brisk and extended Circulation of the Juices, by the turning those <HI>Juices</HI> into <HI>solid</HI> Substances, and thereby fixing and hardning these Solids, and depriving them of their due Elasticity, the <HI>Fluids</HI> circulate with less <HI>Velocity</HI> and Force, and seldom reach the <HI>Extremities</HI> and <HI>smallest Vessels,</HI> but pass through the more <HI>patent</HI> and larger <HI>Vessels,</HI> by their <HI>biggest</HI> lateral Branches. And if with all these unavoidable and irremediable
<PB N="222" REF="270"/>
Circumstances, both the nutritious and serous Part of the <HI>Blood,</HI> and the glo∣bular, become <HI>viscid, thick</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> the Circulation must stop at last, and come to an End. Now 'tis certainly in a great measure in our Power to maintain the <HI>Juices</HI> in a due State of <HI>Fluidity</HI> and <HI>Thinness,</HI> and to render them such, if they are not corrupted to an extreme Degree, so that the re∣maining Part of Life be not too short for such a tedious Work. We certain∣ly may <HI>dilute</HI> and <HI>thin</HI> any <HI>Fluid,</HI> that has an Inlet and Outlet. And the more <HI>fluid</HI> a circulating Liquor is, that is, the <HI>smaller</HI> and <HI>finer</HI> its Parts are, the <HI>less Force</HI> it will require to set it a going, and to continue its Motion. And in animal Bodies the thinner and more <HI>fluid</HI> the Juices are, they will not only circulate by the <HI>less Force,</HI> and with <HI>less Resistance</HI> (i. e. <HI>Pain</HI>) but also, they will preserve by their Circulation, the <HI>Solids</HI> the longer from <HI>stiffening</HI> and <HI>hardening.</HI> There is not a more mis∣chievous, nor greater Mistake than the common one, that <HI>thin</HI> Blood is <HI>poor</HI> Blood, which the Vulgar and Herd of Mankind are as terribly affrighted for, as outward Poverty and Want.
<PB N="223" REF="271"/>
For, on the contrary, the <HI>thinnest</HI> and most <HI>fluid</HI> Blood is the <HI>richest,</HI> that is, the <HI>best</HI> Blood (if <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>good</HI> mean the same Thing). For in <HI>Hydropical, Anasarcous, Cachectick,</HI> and <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Persons, both the serous and globular Part of the Blood is <HI>thick, glewy</HI> and <HI>acri∣monious,</HI> so that it can neither get thro' the <HI>small Vessels,</HI> nor can it be long con∣tained in them, but corrodes and frets them, and so falls (at least the thinnest Part of it) into the Cavities, and begets a <HI>Dropsy</HI>; or stops in and obstructs these small Vessels, and so becomes an <HI>Ana∣sarca</HI> or <HI>Scurvy.</HI> In all which Cases, the serous Part is overloaded with urinous Salts, and becomes a perfect <HI>Lixivium</HI>; so that by its <HI>Grossness</HI> it can∣not run into Globules, to facilitate the Circulation through the <HI>Capillaries</HI> (for these small elastick Globules, by turning Oval or Oblong, wonderfully facilitate the Circulation of the Juices through the <HI>small</HI> Passages) and the red or glo∣bular Part becomes a mere Cake of <HI>Glue</HI>; and thus the Quantity of <HI>Serum</HI> is increased, and the Quantity of the globular Part gradually lessened. And in <HI>this</HI> Sense (of a greater proportion of <HI>Serum</HI>) this State of the Blood may be
<PB N="224" REF="272"/>
called <HI>thin</HI>; but it can in no Sense be called <HI>good</HI> Blood. The thinnest and most fluid Blood, is ever to be look'd upon as the <HI>best</HI> Blood, as consisting of <HI>finest</HI> and <HI>smallest</HI> Parts, which most rea∣dily runs into red Globules, and most easily circulates thro' the <HI>capillary</HI> Vessels, which is the most solid Foundation of good Health and Long Life. Now as nothing but indulging in strong high Foods, which the concoctive Powers cannot break and divide into Parts <HI>small</HI> enough to run into red Globules, or circulate through the <HI>small</HI> Vessels, but overstock them with urinous Salts, which run into <HI>Clusters,</HI> and first <HI>ob∣struct,</HI> and afterwards <HI>break</HI> these small Vessels, and in wallowing in strong Liquors, which parboil and <HI>eat out</HI> the tender and delicate Fibres of the Solids; I say, as nothing but such an Indul∣gence, and such Excesses, long con∣tinued and obstinately persisted in, can beget such a State of the Fluids and Solids, and so bring on a <HI>Cachexy,</HI> which may end in a <HI>Dropsy,</HI> or some other fatal chronical Distemper, according to the Habits and particular Make and Constitution of the Party (for no Person that lived low and meagre, and drank
<PB N="225" REF="273"/>
only small and thin Liquors, ever be∣came Hydropical, if his Solids were originally firm, and his Fluids not tainted with some <HI>hereditary</HI> Sharpness) so I know nothing under the Sun, that can solidly and fully effectuate the con∣trary State of the <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Juices,</HI> to render them <HI>thin,</HI> sweet, and in a con∣stant <HI>flowing</HI> Condition, but taking the contrary Measures, and keeping to a strict Regimen of a <HI>thin, fluid,</HI> spare and lean Diet. We have no possible Way to attenuate, clean and dilute a <HI>Vessel</HI> full of <HI>gross, glewy,</HI> and foul Mixtures, that has only a small Inlet and Outlet, but by pouring into it a thin, clear, insipid <HI>Fluid,</HI> and by shaking it often and much. It is much the same with an animal Body. No <HI>voluptuous</HI> nor <HI>lazy</HI> Person, unless he has had an original Constitution of <HI>Brass,</HI> was ever a <HI>long Liver.</HI> And even then, as his Life has been more Misery and <HI>Pain,</HI> than ever a <HI>sober Gally Slave</HI> endured, his End, and the latter Part of his Days has been Rack and <HI>Torture, Horror</HI> and <HI>Despair.</HI> And though he has not had the Hope nor <HI>Consolation</HI> of a Martyr, yet his <HI>Sufferings</HI> have been far more <HI>exquisite</HI> and <HI>extreme.</HI> All those who have lived
<PB N="226" REF="274"/>
<HI>long</HI> and without much Pain, have lived <HI>abstemiously, poor</HI> and <HI>meagre. Cor∣naro</HI> prolonged his Life, and preserved his Senses, by almost <HI>starving</HI> in his latter Days; and some others have done the like. They have indeed thereby, in some measure, weakned their na∣tural <HI>Strength,</HI> and qualified the Fire and Flux of their <HI>Spirits:</HI> But they have preserved their <HI>Senses,</HI> weakened their <HI>Pains, prolonged</HI> their Days, and procured themselves a gentle and quiet <HI>Passage</HI> into another State. Gentle domestick <HI>Purges</HI> frequently repeated, due <HI>Exercise,</HI> and the Use of the other <HI>Means</HI> prescribed in the foregoing Trea∣tise, will mightily <HI>contribute</HI> toward this End. But the <HI>Ground work</HI> must be laid, carried on, and finished in <HI>Ab∣stemiousness</HI>; and though not in absolute <HI>Fasting</HI> (for that is no ways required, and would be prejudicial) yet in a <HI>thin, poor, low, light</HI> and <HI>meagre</HI> Diet. All the rest will be insufficient without <HI>this.</HI> And <HI>this</HI> alone, without <HI>these,</HI> will suffice to carry on Life, as long as by its natural Frame it was made to last, and will make the Passage <HI>easy</HI> and <HI>calm,</HI> as a Taper goes out for want of Fuel.</P>

<L>Naturamque sequi.—</L></Q> <PB N="231" REF="279"/>If Men would but observe the <HI>golden Mean</HI> in all their <HI>Passions, Appetites</HI> and <HI>Desires</HI>; if in all their <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions,</HI> they would but mind, I will not say the <HI>End</HI> of their <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Existence</HI> here, but the <HI>End</HI> to which their <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions</HI> natu∣rally tended in their last <HI>Resort</HI>; And, <HI>Lastly,</HI> If in the <HI>Gratifications</HI> of their <HI>Ap∣petites, Passions</HI> and <HI>Desires,</HI> they follow'd the uncorrupted <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and neither spurred her on beyond her <HI>Craving,</HI> nor too violently restrained her in her <HI>innocent Biass</HI>; they would enjoy a greater Measure of <HI>Health</HI> than they do; have their <HI>Sensations</HI> more <HI>delicate,</HI> and their <HI>Pleasures</HI> more <HI>exquisite</HI>; live with less <HI>Pain,</HI> and die with less <HI>Horror.</HI> For had it not been for the <HI>Lewdness, Luxury,</HI> and intem∣perate <HI>Gratifications</HI> of the <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Appetites,</HI> which first ruined and spoiled the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> whereby they could <HI>communicate</HI> only a <HI>diseased, crasy</HI> and <HI>untuneable Carcass</HI> to their <HI>Sons,</HI> so that with the <HI>World's Decay, vicious Souls</HI> and <HI>putrified Bodies,</HI> have in this our <HI>Age,</HI> arrived to their highest and most exalted <HI>Degrees</HI>; I say, Had it not been for these <HI>Evils,</HI> there never had

happened so much <HI>Sickness, Pain</HI> and <HI>Misery,</HI> so <HI>unhappy Lives,</HI> and such <HI>wretch∣ed Ends,</HI> as we now behold among <HI>Men.</HI> But even in this our <HI>lapsed Estate</HI> and Condition, had the <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Na∣ture</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> not to say <HI>Religion,</HI> been followed; we might have passed our Days in <HI>Indolence</HI> (at least from <HI>chronical</HI> Distempers) if not innocent <HI>Pleasures,</HI> arrived at a <HI>good old Age,</HI> with our Senses free, and our rational <HI>Faculties</HI> clear, and at last departed in <HI>Peace,</HI> as a <HI>Lamp</HI> goes out for Want of <HI>Oil.</HI> And let the Gentlemen of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> of <HI>Banter</HI> and <HI>Sneer,</HI> hug them∣selves ever so much in their boasted <HI>Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> gratify their <HI>Passions, Appetites</HI> and <HI>Humours</HI> to the <HI>Full,</HI> and despise <HI>Futurity</HI> and <HI>Whining</HI>; I dare promise, when the <HI>Farce</HI> is ended, and the <HI>last Minutes</HI> are drawing on, they would prefer a <HI>Life</HI> thus <HI>led,</HI> and an <HI>End</HI> so <HI>calm,</HI> to all the <HI>Pleasures</HI> of <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>Sensuality,</HI> and the <HI>Bounces</HI> of a false and ignorant <HI>Security.</HI></P>
