<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
ON THE
SOUTH-SEA
TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>A NEW Trade being now to be set on
Foot, and in a New Manner, with a
Capital Stock, and by the Encourage∣ment
of the Government, it has been
long expected when some Able Pen would have
undertaken to guide the People of this unsettled
Age how to think about it.</P>
<P>There has not been in our Memory an Under∣taking
of such Consequence, and so generally to
be engaged in; nor has there been an Undertaking,
about which the People, even those who are to
be concern'd have been so uneasie, their Opini∣ons
of it so confused, and their Knowledge of the
Manner and Circumstances of it so small.</P>
<P>There has not been an Undertaking in this Age
introduced in such a Method, against which so
many People, upon so differing Foundations, are
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
pleased (perhaps some of them hardly knowing
why) to oppose themselves: Before it was form∣ed
it had the general Suffrage of all Mankind,
every Man talk'd of it as a Thing fit to be under∣taken,
worthy of the Encouragement of Parlia∣ment,
Government, Queen and Nation: The o∣mitting
it was tax'd in Print as a Token of Na∣tional
Blindness, and a Want of Judgment in
the Ministry or Managers of all the past Years of
this War. The Advantages the <HI>French</HI> made of it
were look't upon as the great Supports of the War
to them, and what encouraged them to carry it on;
and we were reckon'd unaccountably Negligent, in
that we either did not make those Advantages our∣selves,
or prevent the Enemy from making use
of them against us.</P>
<P>Several Publick Printed Pamphlets disposed to
ridicule the carrying on a War in <HI>Spain,</HI> have
laid down this as the main Point, which the first
Contrivers of that War should have attempted in
the stead of it, and have made a Jest of their Po∣liticks
for the Defect; and when the great Quan∣tities
of Silver which the <HI>French</HI> Squadrons, and
Private Merchant Ships, have brought Home
from the <HI>South-Seas</HI> have been spoken of, it has
been frequently accompanied with Reflections,
and a general Regret, that those happy Advan∣tages
should pass by us▪ alledging, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Nation, who are so much better qualified
every Way, both by their Manufactures to Trade
<HI>with,</HI> Islands to Trade <HI>from,</HI> and Naval Strength
to manage and protect that Trade, should so
long lye still, and leave unattempted, a Trade,
which in the Enemies Hand is so fatal to us, and
which in our Hands might be so fatal to them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Yet notwithstanding all this, such is the evil
Genius of our Times, that now such an Under∣taking
is set on Foot, either it is so ill digested,
or the Persons ushering it into the World are
thought so Disagreeable, or Unskilful, or the Thing
itself so ill placed in our View, that no Under∣taking
of the Kind has met with such a Fate as
this; and if it must go on, it seems throng'd with
Difficulties, calculated to destroy it in its In∣fancy.</P>
<P>It is needful therefore with the utmost Impar∣tiality
to enquire into the Case, and see where
the Objections lye; for against the Trade itself,
<HI>quasi a Trade to the South-Seas,</HI> no Body will,
or can, raise any Objection; the Objection must
be founded either on
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Method.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Time of its Introduction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Or against some Part of the proposed Scheme
of carrying on this Trade.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To enquire out this, to weigh duly the Sub∣stance
of the Objections, and set the whole in
a true Light, that we may determine whether
this Trade is to be carried on, or no, is the Design
of this Essay.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament, which gives the Power
and Limits the Extent of this New Trade, has
given it Birth, and a Name, but has not in the
least directed in what Posture the Persons to be
concern'd shall put themselves, in what Manner
they shall carry it on, how they shall proceed,
or where they shall begin; nor was it necessary
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
that this should be made any Part of the Founda∣tion,
which principally belongs to the Super∣structer:
The Power of an Act of Parliament
was necessary to establish a Company, to give
them Exclusive Priviledges, to limit and restrain
these Priviledges, and settle Bounds between
them and other Trades; but how this Trade is
to be begun, how carried on, where they shall
fix their Footing, from whence to go on pro∣gressively
to the End design'd, this is left entirely
to the dispose of the Body, to whom the Power
and Priviledge of such Trade is deputed.</P>
<P>Now, tho' in the Order of Things we see no∣thing
can be objected against the Regularity of
this Proceeding, yet this seeming on one Hand
to leave the World in the Dark, as to the Man∣ner
of carrying on this Trade, has on the other
Hand filled us with the Crude and Indigested, or
Ill-digested Notions, and Guesses of the Town;
every Man giving his own Opinion in such a
Manner, that from the Variety of Proposals,
which every one makes, from the Difficulties rais∣ed,
and from the Objections brought up against
the Manner of carrying on this Trade, we are
now brought, by Unhappy Degrees, to all Manner
of Confusion of Thoughts about it, and from every
Body laying down a Way how to carry it on,
to every Body crowding in their Suspicions, their
Suggestions of <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> being Impracticable,
and the <HI>other</HI> too Hazardous; one Way <HI>not</HI> Safe,
another <HI>not</HI> Just, a Third <HI>not</HI> Feasible <HI>and the
like,</HI> as if because ye are not at a Certainty
which Way it shall be done, or which is the best
Way to do it, that therefore it cannot be done
at all.</P>
<P>Whether it be the real Opinion of these Ob∣jectors
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
that the Thing is impracticable in itself,
or whether some Men, for Reasons worse
grounded, think it convenient, if possible to have
it appear so, is not the present Debate; if the Mist
may be taken off by cool Reasoning, and People
brought to see by a clear Light, they will be the
less influenced by the Design of any, who may
find it convenient for other Purposes, that this
Case should be as much perplex'd as possible.</P>
<P>To this End this short Tract is made Publick,
in which, if the Case may be stated clearly, the
false Glosses, Mists and Shadows, with which
this Age is amused, taken away, and the Preju∣dices
of People on either Hand removed, per∣haps
we may come to a right Understanding of
the Case: Having premised this by Way of In∣troduction,
it seems naturally to lead the Reader
to a View of the Doubts, now started among us
about this Trade.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Whether this Trade to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> can
be carried on, or no?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Whether the Manner of proposing this
Trade be Rational and Just?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>It seems indispensably necessary to enquire into
these Things first, before we meddle with the
Manner how it is to be carried on, since the Ob∣jections
that seem most to perplex the Town
now, <HI>whether by Design or no,</HI> are laid against the
Thing in general, that it will come to Nothing
that it is a Chimera, a Sham, has Nothing, in it, is
Impracticable, will be Dropt again, was taken
up to serve a Turn, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>The Allegations to sustain this are such as these.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
1. They say the Scheme is Impracticable; that
you propose a Thing not to be done; impossible
in the general Notions of Trade; that this was
not a Season for it; that the Countries you pro∣pose
to Trade with are in the Possession of the
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> our declar'd Enemies;
that 'tis Time enough to talk of Trading thither
when you have some of the Country in Possessi∣on;
that Conquering Nations is a Work which
do's not belong to Merchants and Companies,
whose Stock will be exhausted by any Attempt of
that Kind; that to talk of Trade before Conquest,
and Conquest before any Attempt made, are
equally ridiculous.</P>
<P>2. That when any Part of this Country may
be taken from the Enemy and possess'd, it ought
to be proved that the Enemy shall not be in any
Manner able to dispossess you again, to attack or
molest you; in which Case Commerce and Trade
will not only be interrupted, but entirely disap∣pointed.</P>
<P>3. That neither of the Nations who possess
<HI>South America, viz.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spaniards,</HI> will
ever Capitulate with you, or upon any Terms,
whether in Peace or War, consent to a Free Trade,
and therefore it cannot be expected that the Scheme
as it is proposed can answer the Ends of Trade.</P>
<P>4. That it's evident the Affair of Trade was
not the main End of the Proposal, but other Aims
are couch'd under this Pretence, which other
Aims are not pleasing to the Parties concern'd,
and therefore were glossed over with this pretend∣ed
Advantage, to make them pass the more easily
and undiscovered with the People; but that the
Pretence being equally liable to Objection, as
the Thing design'd, so both together render the
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
Minds of the People more uneasie than they were
before.</P>
<P>The Second Question lies against the Manner
of proposing this Trade, which they say is violent
and unusual, a <HI>Force</HI> upon the People against
their Will, inconsistent with their Liberty, and
that therefore it is entred upon with a general
Dissatisfaction, curs'd by them that are to go in∣to
it, hated by those that refuse it, and ridicul'd
by all; that it is a meer Project of a Party, a Con∣trivance
to serve the Turn they are carrying on
by it, and to put a Face of Payment upon a Debt
which they know not what to do with, and which
made them uneasie; and all this without a Reality,
that they might stifle the Clamour of those whose
just Demands upon the Government could no o∣therwise
be answer'd.</P>
<P>If the Objectors have not full Scope given them
here in relating their Objections, it is only because
the Reproaches and Reflections which they study
to set them off with, and which they very plen∣tifully
bestow upon the Government, and upon
the Persons who they think are the Instruments of
it, are left out, as Things which seem not to be ne∣cessary
at all, either to make their Argument more
forcible, or add to the Number of Reasons; and
this Omission 'tis hoped they will excuse in an Au∣thor
who is not writing to reproach any Side, but
to calm and quiet the Minds of every Side, and
bring Things, if possible, to a clear and right Un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>The
Reader will pardon the Breach of Order, if
in speaking to the Objections the latter come first
in Course; because, as they lye rather against the
Part already acted Introductory to the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, rather than against the Part that shall after∣wards
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>
be acted, they seem to demand to be first
spoken to.</P>
<P>In Order to this it may seem necessary a little Hi∣storically
to enter into the Steps taken on every
Hand to introduce this Affair into the World, and
this without excusing or accusing one Side or other,
may be sufficient to give a right View of the Thing,
and restore People to their Temper in judging
about it.</P>
<P>In the Consultations which of Course employ
the Heads of the Ministers of State every Year
about the Time of the Sitting of the Parliament,
these Three Things generally are the chief.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. How and Where to carry on the War.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How to pay Debts and support Credit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. How to raise Money.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>When these Things in their Ordinary Course
came to be debated the last Parliament, Two
Things with a more than ordinary Weight seem'd
to press upon the Publick.</P>
<P>1. A Vast Debt, which, whether by the Misconduct
of the former Managers, or by the Necessity of the
Publick Affairs, is not to the Purpose here, was lying
upon the Nation in the several Offices of the Navy,
Victualling, Ordnance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with other
Deficiencies, amounting to several Millions, which
as Justice on one Hand called loudly upon them
to make good, so on the other Hand the Publick
Credit was touch'd by it; and if some Provision
was not made for it, there was Reason to fear
Parliamentary Credit would receive a Blow which
would not be easie to recover; and which might
be fatal to all the Schemes and Proposals for
Funds and Loans which might follow, since the
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
People who had trusted the Government with such
Great Sums of Money would too much influence
the future Lending and Lenders of Money, if
no Care was taken to make Payment to them,
whose Debts were so Just as well as so Great.</P>
<P>2. The Second Weight was, the long omitted
Article of attacking the Enemy in that most sen∣sible
Part, from whence they deriv'd so eminently
their Chief Support, and from whence the Si∣news
of War (<HI>viz.</HI> Their Money) were constantly
Supplied to them, I mean their Colonies in <HI>America;</HI>
the Omission of which seem'd a most unaccounta∣ble
Neglect in former Times, and Persons, and the
Attempting which seem'd so inviting at this Time
on Two Accounts. First, as it would interrupt
the Advantageous Commerce of the Enemy: And
Secondly, As it would open a Door of Trade to
our People, which they never yet had Opportuni∣ty
to meddle with, and this Occasion being lost
we were not to hope for another.</P>
<P><HI>Note, <HI>This last Notion is founded on the Trea∣ty
of the General Confederacy, call'd more com∣monly
the Grand Alliance, wherein by the 6th
Article it is stipulated,—That,</HI></HI> It shall be
Lawful for His Royal Majesty of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI>
and the Lords, the States-General,
by Common Advice, and for the Benefit and
Enlargement of the Davigation and Com∣merce
of their Subjects, to seize by their
Forces what Land and Cities they can be∣longing
to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominion in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI>
and whatsoever they shall so take, shall
be their own. <HI>Vid. <HI>the Treaty of the Grand Al∣liance,
p.</HI></HI> 68.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> This is the Occasion, which, as above, it is
humbly presumed may never happen again, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore was not now to be Omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
These Two material Articles coming into Con∣sideration
at the same Time, it came into the
Heads of some, whose Thoughts were more espe∣cially
Intent upon applying proper Remedies to
both these Maladies,—That perhaps some
Method might be found out to Cure them both
with One Plaister, or as we say more vulgarly,
Kill both these Birds with One Stone. To ex∣explain
it more fully.—A Scheme is formed,
wherein it is suggested, that bringing both Cases
together, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Debt which was to be paid,
and the attacking the Enemy in <HI>America,</HI> which
was necessary to be done, One might be so
made assisting and concurring to and with the O∣ther,
that Both might be with the more Ease
effected and brought to pass.</P>
<P>In examining nicely the State of these seve∣ral
Cases, it appear'd, they were naturally to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
divided into Two Heads of Proposals, contain'd
in the following Abridgement.</P>
<P>1. The Payment of the Debt,—and this re∣quir'd
Two Considerations.</P>
<P>1. To pay the principal Debt. O R,</P>
<P>2. To establish a Fund for the Payment of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Interest redeemable, and until redeemed, by Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣liament.</P>
<P>2. The Falling upon the Enemy in their <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Plantations, and this also had Two Branche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>1. The Dispossessing the <HI>French</HI> of the Footin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they had gained among the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> togethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with gaining such a Possession in that Part of <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rica,</HI>
now call'd <HI>New Spain,</HI> as might answer th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Great End, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Pinching the Enemy in that mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
sensible Part, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Fountain of Wealth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>
Treasure, by which, <HI>as before,</HI> they have be
enabled to carry on the War. <HI>And</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
2. The Planting our own People in those Rich
Climates, where, by laying a Foundation of Trade
which was never yet ingaged in, Our Subjects
might come to be enric'd, and made full amends
for the Loss of their <HI>Spanish Trade;</HI> and also the
Channel of Silver which has hitherto flowed
with so full a Stream into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> to
the Support of our Enemies, might be turn'd,
and might with the same Fullness and Freedom
empty itself among our Merchants; and farther,
the Settlements to be made there might be so ma∣ny
Magazines of Wealth to us and our Posterity.</P>
<P>It is Unhappy that a Design big with so many
Advantages has met with this Misfortune, that
the joining together these Two, tho' great and
just Prospects, has been casually and eventually
the Ruin of both; not that we grant them yet
ruined, but that the Difficulties started, and the
Uneasinesses among us rais'd at the Beginning, are
the Causes of ruinous Quarrels, Breaches and Cla∣mours
about it, which it is most easie to prove are
founded upon the want of a right Understanding
and Distinguishing the Case; by which also if
perhaps in the contriving and joining these great
Events together any Mistake has been made, it
might with Ease come to be rectified, without
gratifying those who seem glad of private Mi∣stakes,
in order to push on the greater Mistake,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Design of rendring the Whole abortive
and ineffectual.</P>
<P>To Distinguish therefore rightly of this Mat∣ter,
and thereby come to a Clear Understanding
in it, we ought to debate it Two Ways.</P>
<P>1. In its separate pre-existent State, as a Debt,
and as a Trade respectively.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14"/>
2. In the <HI>now</HI> Conjoined Circumstance, as blend∣ed
together, whereby the Debt and the Trade is
call'd, tho' wrong and erroneously, One <HI>South-Sea
Stock.</HI></P>
<P>In its Separate or Pre-existent State, we find,
as before, Two Things upon the Wheel; or to
speak more plain, the Ministry had Two Things
upon their Hands, either of them necessary to be
done, and both having their respective Difficulties
in the Management.</P>
<P>1. The Debt of the Navy, Ordnance, Victual∣ling,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is no Part of this Work to enquire
how the Government came to be embarrass'd
with so great a Debt unprovided for; whether
the concealing it from the Nation so long, or the
very being a Debt, may be laid to any Man's Door,
or no, is not the Case here: Perhaps the Wri∣ter
of these Sheets differs something from every
Side in his Opinion, and may reserve that Opi∣nion
to defend those who may be defended, and
charge those who may be charged, at another
Time; at present it is of no Signification to the
Point in Hand, and is therefore much better let
alone than meddled with.</P>
<P>The Case of the Debt is evident; the Act for
making Provision for it has set it forth at large;
there remain'd due and owing great Sums, for
which there seem'd to be no Parliamentary Provi∣sion
made, other than the Credit of the Publick;
and which there seem'd to be an absolute Ne∣cessity
to make some present Provision for, both
as it respected the People concern'd, who were
in Distress for their Money, and as it respected
the Publick Credit, which began to suffer by the
high Discounts allow'd on Sale of these Debts.</P>

<P>Not reckoning into this Account the Principal
and Interest of Money Lent the Year before upon
the General Mortgage, and the Interest of the
Whole Sum from the 25th of <HI>March</HI> to the 25th
of <HI>December,</HI> 1711, being Nine Months, both
which Sums amount to One Million Seven Hun∣dred
Fifty-seven Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty-three
Pound Nine Shillings One Peny more.</P>
<P>This is the Account as by the Act of Parlia∣ment
for settling this Matter it is cast up; a vast
Debt.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
A Vast Debt to be clear'd in One Session of Par∣liament,
and that in a Session too, in which so
great a Sum for the ordinary Service of the com∣ing
Year was absolutely necessary to be given,
and was given accordingly, amounting to
above Six Millions Sterling, so that Inclu∣sive
of the Sum above Voted to be provided for,
this Parliament were oblig'd to raise such a Sum as
never was heard of in the World, and such a Sum
as when talk'd of in Foreign Countries in the Dia∣lect
of their Finances will make such a Sound as
must amaze the World, and make them conclude,
That a Nation which can raise such Sums can ne∣ver
be subdued for Want of Money; let any Man
but think of Fourteen Millions Sterling to be
rais'd in One Session of Parliament, making in
<HI>Spain</HI> Seven and Forty Millions of Pieces of
Eight, or in <HI>French</HI> Livres, or <HI>German</HI> Florins,
above One Hundred and Sixty-four Millions.</P>
<P>These Things are not hinted to enlarge the
Sound of Words; but the Sum being really thus
great, which was of Necessity to be rais'd seems
to argue very strongly with those Gentlemen,
who being Creditors to the Government in the
Articles above, seem to quarrel the Manner of their
being paid, <HI>viz.</HI> by an Establish'd Interest, that
they ought to have been paid in Money, tho'
with Time; that they should have been left
to Payments in Course, and that they had Inte∣rest
running on their Bills, and were better be∣fore
than now.</P>
<P>Where I an utter Enemy to the very Name and
Persons of the Present Managers of Publick Affairs;
were I bent to quarrel at all they did, because they
did it; were I to set apart a Pen dipt in Gall to a∣sperse
and reproach every Action of their Ministry,
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
and resolv'd as far as in me lay to be a general
Evil Genius, to blast and scandalize Things for the
Sake of Men, Men for the Sake of Parties,
and Parties for the Sake of Prejudice, a Practice
too much the Mode among us for some Years
past; were this Paper, I say, directed by such a
Spirit as this, yet I could not find any Room in
this Part of the Affair to raise the least Objection;
for I cannot see, speaking with the utmost Impar∣tiality,
that in the Circumstances of Publick Af∣fairs
as they then stood, the Parliament could
do any Thing <HI>Less</HI> or <HI>More</HI> than they did.</P>
<P>1. They could not do <HI>Less</HI> than take some
Care to bring the Debt to some Point of Certainty.</P>
<P>The Demand was Great and Loud; the Sum
was branch'd out into Multitudes of Hands, and
those Hands such as being the Trading Sort of
People, could not <HI>the best of any</HI> be without their
Money; this was attended with several intolera∣ble
Evils.</P>
<P>1. It caused the Poor People to run to the Stock-jobbers,
to the Man-eating Discounters, and Money-lending
Extortioners, either to pledge or sell their
Bills; and the Payments in Course appearing
every Day more and more Remote and Uncer∣tain,
those <HI>Cannibals,</HI> for in some Sence they are
such, made every Day their Advantage of it to
prey upon the Necessitous and Indigent People,
till the Discount of these Bills came to near 40
<HI>per Cent.</HI> and the Tickets of Poor Sailors to a∣bove
50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Discount, if Sold; and Loans
upon them were worse, they being not to be had
under 10 to 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest, which in a
few Years would swallow up the whole Debt,
Principal and Interest, as is plain without putting
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
the Reader to the Trouble to run over Tables of
Calculation.</P>
<P>2. This every Day sunk the Credit of the Na∣vy,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> so that the Rates of every thing rising in
Proportion to the Discount of their Bills, would
soon have brought the Queen's Affairs to the same
or a wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Posture than his late Majesty King
<HI>William</HI> struggled with when the Sum given by
Parliament, thro' the Extravagance of Discount,
Prices of Goods, and Deficiences of Funds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were generally to be accounted in real Aid of the
Publick Service to be not above One Third of
what they were called in the Votes of the House.</P>
<P>These Things being before them, it is left to
any one to consider, whether the Parliament only
giving Money for the ordinary Service of the
Navy, Victualling, Ordnance, Transport▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
every Year, and so leaving Payments to be made
in Course, had been either Prudent or Practicable,
since every Year the ordinary Service brought us in
Debt farther than the Sums demanded by Acci∣dents
unforeseen, and impossible to be provided for.</P>
<P>There might be much more said, but it is left
to the most dissatisfied rational Man in the Na∣tion
to say, whether to have left the Case to Pay∣ments
in Course, as above, had been any Thing else
than just a putting off the Evil Day, and leaving
the Debt as a growing Disease, which may at pre∣sent
be borne with, but will at last infallibly prove
mortal, bring a slow, but certain, Death upon the
Body▪ encreasing every Day till at last it should
have been so great, that they could never have
paid it at all. This I take to be the True, Im∣partial
State of the Case at that Time, and there∣fore
I say the Parliament could not have done <HI>Less</HI>
than they did, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to bring the Debt to a Point:
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
fix the Sum; establish a Fund of Interest for the
Payment and Annual Discharge of the Increase, that
they might know what they were in Debt, and
might hereafter take a convenient Occasion, as the
Publick Affairs would permit, to discharge the
Whole.</P>
<P>To ha' paid neither Principal nor Interest
must at last have made the Debt intolerably
Great, reduc'd the Creditor to unsufferable
Hardships, and in Time the Discount of those
Bills would have run at 70 and 80 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and
the Offices would ha' been able to have bought
no Stores or Provisions at all, but what they must
have advanc'd ready Money for, which ready
Money either they would not have to pay, or the
Payments in Course must entirely stop.</P>
<P>Let any Man judge this with Impartiality, and
censure it if they can; I must own I do not see
what the Parliament could do <HI>Less</HI> than they did
in the Case of the Debt, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to put it upon a
Fund for the Payment of the Interest, till Provisi∣on
may be made for the Principal, which Principal
it is evident they were not in a Condition to make
a present Provision for; and this leads me to the
Second Head, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>2. That I do not see what they could do <HI>More.</HI>
There are but Two Articles in the Case of a Debt.
1. Payment of Principal. 2. Payment of Inte∣rest.—If
the first cannot be done, the last must;
this is only a Consideration for the Party's stay∣ing
till the other can be done. No Man tho' he
cannot pay a Debt can be call'd a Bankrupt, if he
offers Security, and pay the Interest; it is no
Reproach to the Nation or the Government to say
they cannot pay this Great Principal Debt, at least
Now; but you are offer'd in the Nation's Behalf
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>
the Payment of Interest, and that Interest conti∣nued
till the Principal be paid: So that in the
Common Course and the Nature of Things the Na∣tion
is no Way to be term'd Bankrupt; the Debt
is secured, and were there not something else
in it, this Payment would have been allowed to
be very good; for why should we tread on one a∣nother's
Heels to purchase Annuities of Interest
at but Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> and pay our ready Money
with such Eagerness for them; and yet refuse the
same Interest for a Debt which we would before
have sold for 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Discount, or perhaps
had bought with that Allowance. This is a most
unaccountable Paradox, and to consider the Debt
in its separate Capacity it is really something My∣sterious
on other Accounts, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>I might add here also to encrease the Wonder
that the Settlement allows the past Interest to be
cast up, and to be added to the Principal, and
the running Interest for the Future to be paid
upon the Whole; so that the Creditor turns Usu∣rer
upon the Government, and receives Interest
upon Interest, which he had no Title to before;
and which I mention, because it will occur again
to be spoken of, as being a full Equivalent to all
that Advance, which can be recalled out of his
Hands for the Stock of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company,
of which by itself.</P>
<P>(2.) This brings us to the Consideration of
this Affair in its Complex Posture, in its Con∣join'd
Circumstances; (<HI>viz.</HI>) as the Payment of
this Debt is blended together with a Thing Fo∣reign,
<HI>say some,</HI> in its Nature Exotic, and remote to
the Notions and Understandings of the Generality
of the People particularly concern'd in this
Debt; out of their Way, foreign to their Busi∣ness,
<PB N="23" REF="21"/>
and consequently Disagreeable and Unsa∣tisfying.</P>
<P>The
Ministry, <HI>if I may venture to say so,</HI> I be∣lieve
had quite other Notions of this Part of the
Case, and annexed this Article to the other as an
Additional Consideration to the Debt aforesaid,
expecting no doubt that the Exclusive Pri∣viledge
of a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> should be
receiv'd with a particular Satisfaction, should be
valued at something in the Rate of their Debt, and
should have made the Subscription more worth to
those that subscribed; that it was given in as an
Encouragement to all People who should hereaf∣ter
Trust the Government; that in Consideration
of their having been kept out of their Money,
these Things were thrown in, both to gratifie and
oblige them. (1.) The turning their past Interest
into Principal, and, (2.) The giving them an Exclu∣sive
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> a Trade so improved
in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and so capable to
be improved in ours.</P>
<P>I am perswaded, speaking without the least
Respect of Persons, the Projectors who contri∣ved,
the Government or Ministry who managed,
nay, the very Parliament who granted this Act,
understood this Case in some Measure as I have
put it, and the Reasons are these.</P>
<P>1. Because really in the Nature of the Thing,
abstracted from Prejudice and Party, it seems that it
is certainly so. How infinitely then does the Plague
of Parties influence all our Affairs! And how
does it change the very Nature and Consequence
of Things!</P>
<P>2. Because, had they not conceived thus of
it, they would never have tack'd it to a
<PB N="24" REF="22"/>
Thing of this Value and Consequence, since I
believe it will be readily granted, that either of
these Things, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the settling a Fund of Inte∣rest
for the Debt, and the erecting a Publick
Company for a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> would
have been leap'd at apart by every one concern'd in
the first, or capable of venturing in the last; and
I think I do not speak without Book in either
of these.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire, why that, which in a
seperate Consideration is so clear, and without
exception, should fall under such a general Dis∣like
when brought together; that there are some
Reasons to be assign'd, which are Invidious,
Personal, and which the Author of this cares not
to mention, is a Thing rather to be sigh'd for than
disputed; but some Reasons other than these may
be hinted at.</P>
<P>1. The seeming Force there is in the Act, to
make these the Company, and none else, and
to oblige these to be the People.</P>
<P>2. The unhappy sorting of the People, in the
Consequence of the Act, putting them up∣on
the Trade, who are neither qualified by Cir∣cumstances
or Genius to it, and who by their
Ignorance have brought themselves to dislike
it, even because they do not understand.</P>
<P>Both these I take to be Misfortunes to the Pro∣posers
of this Affair; and yet both are Things,
which, 1. They could not easily foresee. And,
2. Foreseeing they could not easily prevent,
without putting all upon a Hazard.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="23"/>
1. They could not easily <HI>foresee</HI> it; for who
could have imagin'd that a Thing so generally
applauded before, which we had been blam'd so
often and so publickly for neglecting, which our
Enemies the <HI>French</HI> have made such Infinite Ad∣vantage
of, should not be esteem'd an Advantage
to us? <HI>Or that,</HI> to oblige them all to an equal
and proportion'd Subscription would be taken as
an Imposition? I must own I'm against all
Manner of Force, and think it had been better
here left more to Choice; <HI>But how better?</HI> I do
not mean better for the <HI>People,</HI> but better for
the <HI>Ministry;</HI> that their Work had been easier,
and the Popular Clamour less without it; for
the Advantage proposed is to the People, not to
the Ministry; and the Force then is no more than
as you would have forc'd a Child or a Lunatick
out of a House that was on Fire; and I ra∣ther
put it thus upon a Supposition, that there
is some Constraint, than argue, tho' the Case
might hear it, strictly speaking, that really here
is no Force at all.</P>
<P>2. But suppose the Ministry had foreseen that
the Notion of a Force, how much soever to our
Advantage, is so Irksome a Thing, that it would
hazard the bringing the Proposal into a general
Dislike. Since Liberty is so Nice a Thing that
it should not be touch'd upon, tho' it was never
so much to the Advantage of the Person;
yet I own I do not see how they could go
forward (<HI>viz.</HI>) in joining the Two Proposals,
and leave the Thing more to Choice, than they
have done.</P>
<P>Liberty is an Invaluable Priviledge, and no
Man can in his right Understanding be easily a∣ble
to be too careful of it.—I remember a Story
<PB N="26" REF="24"/>
of Two <HI>English</HI> Soldiers in <HI>Catalonia</HI> this very
War.—The General finding that the Liberty our
People took in eating Grapes, and other Luscious
Fruits in those hot Countries, was very destructive
to the Health of the Men, that it threw them into
Fluxes and Fevers, and destroyed great Numbers
of them, made an Order that none of the Men
under great Penalty should eat any Grapes.—Two
<HI>English</HI> Soldiers had transgress'd the Order,
and carried the Punishment along with the Crime,
for they fell into a Flux, and were dangerously
III.—The Officer order'd them to be brought
before him, in Order to punish them: One of
the Men answer'd, <Q REND="inline">'The General may e'en let us
alone, for we shall not trouble him long. How∣ever,
Sick as they were, Orders in the Army
must be observed, and they were brought before
him, <HI>for go they could not.</HI> The Officer ask'd
them how they durst eat Grapes when they knew
the Order▪ the Fellow boldly told him, <HI>That in
all his Orders as to the Service they had obeyed
punctually, and never transgrest; but in this, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
what concern'd themselves only, they were</HI> English
men <HI>and</HI> Freemen, <HI>and thought they ought to be at</HI>
LIBERTY <HI>to Kill themselves whenever they
had a Mind to it.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Indeed upon these Nice Principles of Liberty
here may be some Force alledged, but in the main
it cannot be so properly called <HI>Force;</HI> because e∣very
Man that does not think fit to come in may
remain in the State he was before; nor do I think
that State is or can be made <HI>Worse</HI> than before
because other Provision than a Parliamentary
Fund of Interest could never be made, or be ex∣pected
to be made; and if I judge right of the
Additional Article, which they call the <HI>South-Sea
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
Stock,</HI> which is reckon'd an Incumbrance, it stands
upon this Foot, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it takes nothing from
the Subscription which it does not first add to it;
because the Interest which is paid by this Sub∣scription
upon the Arrear of Interest allowed to
be added to the Principal, amounts in Time to
much more than the 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which is to be
called in by the Company to form the Stock for
Carrying on the Trade.</P>
<P>Perhaps this has not been much thought of by
those who complain of the Hardships that this
Trade is to them; and this may be farther improved
by such whose Business it is to defend the Proposal
in General: These Sheets are not prepared to defend
one Side against another, but as far as is possible
to set the Matter in a clear Light between both,
that they may see for themselves what it is pro∣per
to do or say in the Case.</P>
<P>It seems very unhappy to this Nation that such
Uneasiness, and such Strife, and Clamour, and
Party-making, should be among us, about not
the Things themselves, but the meer joining them
together, since, as it is noted before, take them
asunder, and I make no Doubt but we should be
very ready to embrace them both: I explain my
self thus.</P>
<P>I cannot think but that all the Persons
concern'd in the Debt upon the Navy, Transport,
Victualling, Ordnance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whose Debt was in
the Posture and Condition as was before obser∣ved,
would have been very well contented and
satisfied with an Act of Parliament establishing a
Fund of Perpetual Interest at 6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their
Debt till the Principal shall be paid, and would
have taken it as a very great Advantage to have
the Arrear of Interest added to the Principal
<PB N="28" REF="26"/>
Debt; had the Act gone no farther than this, I
firmly believe every one had been fully satisfied
and thankful: My Reasons for it are these.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Why should we not think so</HI> when we reflect
on the precarious Condition of those Debts be∣fore?
(1.) How impossible to be paid in ma∣ny
Ages by the Course of the Navy? (2.) How
certain to encrease every Year by the same Ne∣cessity
that brought 'em to the Height they were
at.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Why should we not think so</HI> when we reflect
how well content People were with the like Me∣thod?
Tho' with but 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Interest in for∣mer
Cases, as in that of the Orphans Debts in
the City of <HI>London,</HI> and how long and earnestly
the Creditors of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Debt have been
soliciting for the same Grace, in either of which
Cases the Debt was not less Just, or more unlike∣ly
to be some Time or other paid than this: But
if these are thought remote Instances, there are
other nearer our View which I need not name▪
Let such as question this look back to our Old
Transport Debt, Parliamentary Deficiencies, Loans
on Coals, and Culm, Glass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Irish Estates
Army Debentures, <HI>and many other</HI> the Odd Ends
of the late Wars; for which, during the long So∣licitation
in Parliament, and at the Treasury, this
used to be the Plea, <HI>If they cannot pay us the
Debt, let them give us a Fund for the Interes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and we are satisfied, then we can sell it, then we
can make something of it.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Why should not we think so</HI> when we see, as
is hinted above, Annuities settled on Funds of In∣terest
at the same Rate, or rather lower? And
which Annuities are but just the same Thing a
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
this, so eagerly purchased with ready Money, so
easily filled before the very Signing of the Act,
and bought afterwards at the Advance of a Year's
and a Year and half's Purchase.</P>
<P>These are some of the Reasons why I think
had this Fund of Interest stood by itself as a Se∣curity
for the Payment of this Debt, adding the
Arrear of Interest to the Principal Debt, and turn∣ing
the Whole into an Annuity of 32 Years at
6 <HI>per Cent.</HI> with the Principal Money to be then
repaid, nay, tho' the Principal Money had been
then to sink, it would gladly have been accepted.</P>
<P>Now let us see the Misfortune of our Divisi∣ons
and Breaches among ourselves which occasi∣ons
all this Murmur.—The Annexing to this
Fund of Interest, the Priviledge of this Trade to
the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> to be carried on by a Stock
to be raised upon 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> only of this
Debt; and even this 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> obtain'd in the
Subscription over and above the Debt by giving
an Interest upon the Arrear of Interest in the
Debt. This is the Fly in the Sweet Ointment of
the Apothecary, which causes it, however heal∣ing
in itself, to send forth a stinking Savour.</P>
<P>Now it would be enquired here why this was
added by the Government? Was it for some Gain
the Ministry were to make of it? Or, Was it
given in as a supposed Advantage to the Subscri∣bers,
to encourage them, and to make amends, for
the Loss they sustain'd by being out of their Mo∣ney.</P>
<P>As
to any Advantage to the Government by
granting the Priviledge of a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI>
and erecting a Company for that Purpose,
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
I shall give full Space for any one that can to
set those Advantages down: I profess myself ig∣norant
of any real Advantage made by it, no, not
One Farthing to the Government, or to the Mi∣nistry,
either Publick or Private:—If there is
any supposed Advantage in the putting that Part
of the Stock which remains in the Treasury in∣to
a Form, so as it may be passed in
Payment, <HI>&amp;c. as it now is;</HI> I answer, this is
no Advantage at all, because the same
would have been made in the Annuities or
Funds of Interest without it, and perhaps more
to the Satisfaction of the Receiver, as well as
to the Credit of the Payer; and therefore this
cannot be placed to the Account of the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, or brought as a Reason why the Govern∣ment
joined it to the Interest of the Debt: Nor
indeed upon the strictest Examination can I find
that ever any Advantage was pretended either by
the Ministry in proposing it, or charg'd upon them
by the Objectors to it; but that truly and <HI>bona
fide</HI> the Ministry proposed this meerly as an
Advantage to the Subscribers; as an Encourage∣ment
to the People concern'd, and as a Means
to promote a Trade which might be in the End
so glorious to the Nation, so profitable to the
Parties concern'd, and so manifest a Foundation
of the Increase of Wealth and Commerce to the
Whole. If there are any other Clauses of Advan∣tage
to the Government than these, I must own
they are laid out of my Sight; nor I believe can
the greatest Enemies of the present Project find
them out, at least I have never heard them as∣sign'd,
and shall say more to it when I do.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29"/>
<HI>On the other Hand,</HI> had the Ministry proposed
such a Trade by itself; had Books been laid open
in the City for a Voluntary Subscription of a
Stock to carry it on; had the Adventure been
proposed with the Favour, and under the Pro∣tection,
of the Government, with all its Hazards,
with all its supposed Impracticable Parts; had
the Priviledges and Limitations of the present
Act been offered, What think you, <HI>Gentlemen
Objectors?</HI> Will you speak your Thoughts Im∣partially,
without Party Prejudice, under this
Ministry, or any Ministry? Would it ha' been
rejected? Would not any Sum ha' been subscri∣bed?
Would Adventurers ha' been found, or no?
I am perswaded no Man will say it would ha'
failed; no Man can doubt it, if they will consi∣der
the forward Humour of the Age in New Ad∣ventures;
or the long Interruption of Trade by
the War, which has left the Merchants of this
City and Nation less Room to extend their Com∣merce
than formerly; if they consider the Flush
Stocks which our Trading People are furnished
with, and their Readiness to launch out, where
there are probable Advantages: These Things
considered, there can be no doubt but such a Pro∣posal
standing by itself had been very well re∣lished
by the Generality of our People; nay, I
will not say but they would have purchased the
Priviledges and Protection, now slighted, with
the Advance of Money, as was done in the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade, and has been offered in others.
Nor am I alone, I believe, in my Opinion.</P>
<P>But have we not something then Peculiar in
the Fate of this Nation, which an indifferent
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
Man must needs lament, that the Surface of Af∣fairs
can so much alter our Temper, and that our
Judgments are so over rul'd by our Prejudices,
that we cannot approve of that join'd together,
which we would so freely embrace if offered a∣part?
I am not writing Satyrs here, nor plead∣ing
for a Party, if I were I should take some
Freedom on both Sides; I should perhaps re∣proach
those People who will reject Publick Ad∣vantages
for the Sake of Private Prejudices; and
because they cannot go along with the Publick in
all their Proceedings, will not therefore go along
with them in those wherein the general Good
is evidently carried on.—I should, on the other
Hand, perhaps say, that the joining these Two
Unhappy Happy Thoughts together was no To∣ken
of making a right Judgment of the Temper
of our Times, and the only Cause of the
Disorder that has happened among us upon this
Head.</P>
<P>Unhappy Conjunction! That Two Good
Things should make One Bad One; Two Things
equally Happy asunder, Advantageous, Pleasing
and Profitable, apart, but put together pleases every
Body the less, and hardly and Body so well as
they would do asunder.</P>
<P>If any Man enquires why this is so? Why
that, which in itself is Agreeable, Useful, and
Profitable, should not be so when join'd with ano∣ther
Thing equally so? Answer might be given
several Ways, in Brief thus.</P>
<P>1. The Thing is Party-curst, it is attack'd by
a Variety of Clashing, Quarrelling People; some
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
cry it so much up beyond its real Merit, and o∣thers
run it down so far below, that the Strife
has rendred it a Bone of Contention.</P>
<P>2. Some find fault with it, because they do
not understand it, and some because <HI>they think</HI>
they do;—and the Multitude of Inquirers on
one Hand, and Expositors on the other; some
asking what it is, who know well enough before;
others pretending to tell them what it is, while
they know nothing of it themselves; by this the
Text is rendred Intricate, which in itself was
plain enough, and we amuse ourselves with Dif∣ficulties
where there are none.</P>
<P>3. The Project and the People are unhappily
ill sorted, by putting the Trade as an Appendix
to the Debt; had the Debt been settled on a
Fund, as above; had Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> been allowed
for Interest till the Principal had been paid; or
had they added One <HI>per Cent.</HI> more, and sunk
the Principal, the People had gone away well satis∣fied,
and they had sold for the full Value; if the
Government had had any reserved Stock of them
they would ha' been as Current as <HI>Chequer</HI> Bills,
and might ha' been issued out on any Account
whatsoever; but clogg'd with this <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Trade, like Two Men in the Water, who are
but Young Swimmers, alone they might make
shift to get out well enough, and People at Hand
would help them; but clasping together they
sink out of reach, and drown one another.</P>
<P>So of the Trade, it falls among People unac∣quainted
with Trade, that have no Occasion to
venture to Sea, understand nothing of Merchan∣dizing,
<PB N="34" REF="32"/>
and therefore they cannot think of it with
any Temper. Butchers, Grasiers, Cheesemongers,
Ship chandlers, Carpenters. Smiths, (and other
Handicrafts,) Brewers, Bakers, Coopers, and the
like, and an infinite Number of these; to talk
to these of a <HI>South Sea</HI> Trade is to talk <HI>Hebrew</HI>
and <HI>Arabic:</HI> Like <HI>Esop</HI>'s Cock, they spurn the
Diamond with Contempt, and will sell Two
of them for an Handful of Barley.</P>
<P><HI>These are some of the Grounds and Reasons
of the Contempt of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade: The
Answers and Remedies I reserve to speak of in
its Course.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Particular Article of the
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> and since it is to no Pur∣pose
to Object against the Conjunction, let us
enquire into them complexly.</P>
<P>1. Is the Annuity the worse for the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Stock?</P>
<P>2. Is the Stock the worse for the Annuity?</P>
<P>The Annuity is the worse for the Stock thus far▪
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that 10 <HI>per Cent</HI> upon the Original Stock
is liable to be call'd for, to be set apart as a Stock
for carrying on a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> so
far you may say the Annuity is the worse.—But
then this is also upon a Supposition that this
<HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade shall entirely miscarry. And these
Objections lye against that Supposition.</P>
<P>1. If it does miscarry it does not follow that
they must run out all their Stock; there are In∣stances
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
of many Undertakings in Trade, where the
Parties finding a Stop to the Prospect, or an Im∣probability
of Success, have laid it down with lit∣tle
Loss, perhaps. One Quarter lost, or more; and
is all this Clamour worth while for the Hazard of 2
and 1/2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> supposing it should imscarry; for it
does not follow they must wind off all the Bot∣tom;
it is very probable the Company will see
whether they are likely to stand or no, get or
lose, hold or fail, before they have run out One
Quarter Part of so great a Stock as is proposed to
be adventured here.</P>
<P>2. If it should not miscarry, but the Trade be
established and thrive, all this Argument is then
at an End; then happy would be the Day that
the Stock was Subscrib'd, happy the Thought
that laid the Scheme; and he that cries it must
down, now flatters us then soonest with his good
Opinion of it, and pretends he thought so from
the Beginning; nor can the Trade be then the
worse for the Annuity.</P>
<P>But how can this be, <HI>say the Objectors?</HI> Suc∣ceed!
It cannot succeed! the Thing is not Practi∣cable,
the Door is not Open for a Trade; to set
People to trade now, is as if the Government
wanted more Confederates, and were to incorpo∣rate
a Body of Men to make War, not to Trade;
that the New Company shall join in the Grand
Alliance; and, like a little Republick, help to carry
on the War; that we must fight our Way thro',
and trade <HI>au coup de Canon.</HI> A Trade! <HI>says One,</HI>
It must be a Trade in Blood, we see no other
Trade in view; for let which Party soever pre∣vail
the Trade must be carried on by Force; nei∣ther
King <HI>Philip,</HI> nor King <HI>Charles,</HI> will let their
<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
Subjects Trade with you but by Force, on Pain of the
Gallows, and with all possible Difficulty and
Hazard. It is therfore but an Amusement of
Trade, say they without any Reality; and this
being so visible a Collusion, they tell us, makes
all the rest be suspected, and is a great Argu∣ment
of the General Dislike.</P>
<P>And thus I am brought to enquire, as <HI>in the
Title,</HI> Whether this Trade is to be carried on,
<HI>yea,</HI> or <HI>No?</HI> Whether in Reality such a Trade
is Probable or Feasible? Or, Whether it is Im∣practicable,
and not to be attempted but with a
Folly next to Lunacy, which is suggested.</P>
<P>To come at this Question in a Posture that
may render the Answer intelligible, it seems ne∣cessary
to state the Thing itself question'd about,
and to lay down in as clear Terms as possible
what this Thing call'd the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade is;
what it means as it is now vulgarly accepted;
and what we are to understand by it.</P>
<P>By the Trade to the <HI>South Seas</HI> we are to un∣derstand
One of these Three Things.</P>
<P>1. An Open, Free Commerce of the <HI>British</HI> Na∣tion
to and in the several Ports and Places of <HI>Ameri∣ca,</HI>
possess'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> either such as are, or
shall be, Reduced by us, or by King <HI>Charles</HI> III.
with Liberty to carry our Manufactures and Mer∣chandizes,
Ships and Factor, thither directly, with∣out
Stop in <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and to lade, return and
bring back from thence such Goods as shall be
purchased there; and in short, to Trade thither
as the <HI>French</HI> do now with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under
King <HI>Philip,</HI> or as we do to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI>—
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
And in this Sense I think it can be no Offence to
say this Trade can never be Carried on.</P>
<P>2. Or, <HI>We are to understand</HI> a Settling in some
Part of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> whe∣ther
by Way of Conquest, Factory, or otherwise,
as by the 6th Article of the Grand Alliance (quo∣ted
before) we are allowed to do; and keeping
the said Settlement as our own, erect there a Free
Market for our <HI>European</HI> Goods; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
having Free Access to come thither to Buy, and
we having Liberty from thence to trade to their
Dominions above.—And in this Sense it is as
Impracticable to carry on this Trade as in the
other.</P>
<P>3. Or, by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> we are
to understand our Seizing some such Part or Place
in <HI>America,</HI> whether already possess'd, or not pos∣sess'd,
as we shall think proper, and taking it as
our own, by Virtue of the Treaty above noted, to
settle, plant and inhabit the same as a Colony,
erecting there such Trade with the Adjacent
Countries, whether <HI>Spaniards</HI> or others, and im∣proving
the Native Fruitfulness of the Place as
much as possible, taking at the same Time all
Opportunities to open a Trade with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
as much as Circumstances will admit, and which
there is no Question will be considerable.—And
this is the Way a Trade may be carried on.—This
I am of the Opinion is the Way of
Trade the Government proposes, and what they
mean by a Trade to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> and this is
so far from being little or inconsiderable, howe∣ver
it may be less than the Golden Mountains some
People have form'd Notions of in their Imagi∣nation,
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
that this Trade is not only probable to
be Great, but capable of being the Greatest, most
Valuable, most Profitable, and most Encreasing
Branch of Trade in our whole <HI>British</HI> Commerce,
well worth all the Hazard, Adventure, Expence,
and Pains of the Undertaking; sufficient to encou∣rage
us in the Prospect, and reward us in the Exe∣cution;
a Trade, which had it been offer'd to the
Merchandizing Part of Mankind, who understood
Trade, who were employ'd in Commerce, and
accustom'd to Adventures, and not unhappily
join'd in and tied down to a Rabble of casual
Subscribers, neither inclin'd to, capable of, or in
the least having a Genius to trade, it would no
doubt have met with another kind of Reception
than now it has.</P>
<P>It were to be wisht that in order to set Things
right among us, People would give themselves
leave to distinguish a little between what <HI>is,</HI>
and what <HI>is not,</HI> the Design in this Thing, cal∣led
the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Trade, and between what <HI>may
be done,</HI> and <HI>may not be done,</HI> that we may not
presently argue ourselves out of all the Trade
because we have not the Gates of <HI>Mexico</HI> opened
to us. This is no Part of the Thing, the very
Word <HI>South-Seas</HI> in the Act of Parliament de∣notes
otherwise, the Words <HI>find out</HI> and <HI>discover</HI>
mention'd in the Act tell us otherwise.</P>
<P>We are to find out or discover some Place or
Places in <HI>America,</HI> where we may fix and settle
a <HI>British</HI> Colony, which by the Treaty is to be
our own; and is not this enough? Will not Trade
fall in? Will not the Country produce to us as well
as to the <HI>Spaniards?</HI> Are we less industrious
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
than they; if we fix in a barren Spot that's our
Fault, but why not somewhere among the Gold,
the Silver, the Drugs, the Indico, Cocoa, Coche∣neal,
and the like, as well as they; and being si∣tuated
here, fixt, and settled, can we want a
Trade? Did any Man think all we were to do
was only to carry Goods to <HI>Cartagena</HI> and <HI>Pana∣ma,</HI>
and bring home Money? This bears no Pro∣portion
to the Design, nor is of a Duration worth
our depending upon; for it would be every
Day in the Power of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to put an end
to it, and prohibit it again. But our Business is
to seize and possess, <HI>mark the Word in the Article
of the Grand Alliance,</HI> and to keep it for our own.</P>
<P>This is then what we are to understand by a
Trade to the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) that we shall,
under the Protection, in the Name, and by the
Power of Her Majesty, <HI>Seize, Take▪</HI> and <HI>Pos∣sess,</HI>
such Port or Place, or Places, Land, Ter∣ritory,
Country or Dominion, <HI>call it what you
please,</HI> as we see fit in <HI>America,</HI> and <HI>Keep it for
our own, Keeping it</HI> implies Planting, Settling,
Inhabiting, Spreading, and all that is usual in
such Cases: And <HI>when this is done,</HI> what are we
to do with it? <HI>Why,</HI> we are to Trade <HI>to</HI> it, and
<HI>from</HI> it; <HI>Whither?</HI> Where-ever we can with
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> or any Body that will Trade with us;
and it is not saying we shall have no Trade with
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when we say they will not suffer
their People freely to Trade with us; but let the
<HI>English</HI> get a good Footing on the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Coast of <HI>America,</HI> and let them and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
alone for Trading with one another, let the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> prevent it if he can.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="38"/>
This is what I am willing to have called the
True Design of this <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and I
am the rather so, because I have seen no Scheme,
nor can I form any Scheme in my Thoughts upon
any other Foundation that is Feasible in its Nature,
or Practicable in any of its Parts.</P>
<P>The Contrivers of this Undertaking know too
well the Temper, Constitution, and State of
Affairs, of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to have pro∣mis'd
to themselves, that by any Treaty, Capitu∣lation,
or Stipulation, either in <HI>New Spain</HI> or
<HI>Old,</HI> they will ever be brought to lay open the
Trade of their <HI>Indies</HI> to the <HI>English,</HI> or indeed to
any Nation of the World.</P>
<P>Perhaps they might be brought to admit a
Trade to particular Places for Provisions, Fish,
Corn, or such Things as they may more particu∣larly
want in those Places for the Subsistence of
their People: Or, they may be brought to treat
with you for an Assento or Permission to bring
Negroes to them; a Thing more proper for the
<HI>African</HI> Company than any other; and the Rea∣son
for that may be only because they know not
where else to have them. But that they will per∣mit
you to a Free Importation among them of your
<HI>European</HI> Manufactures, and Exportation of
Bullion from them, is so contrary to the Nature of
their Trade, so destructive to their own Interest,
and would be so fatal to the very Life and Be∣ing
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions in <HI>Europe,</HI> I mean
as to Commerce, that unless the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to
be divested of common Sense, Infatuate, and given
up, abandoning their own Commerce, throwing a∣way
<PB N="41" REF="39"/>
the only Valuable Stake they have left in
the World, and in short, bent to their own Ruin,
we cannot suggest that they will ever on any
Consideration, or for any Equivalent, part with so
Valuable, indeed so Inestimable a Jewel, as the
Exclusive Power of Trade to their own Plantati∣ons
in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Mistaking of this I believe to be another
Reason, and perhaps One of the Chief too, of the
pretended Dislike and Complaint against this Un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>It is always a Disadvantage to any Underta∣king
to have it represented in Unintelligible
Terms, and to have it make high Pretensions,
even to Things Impracticable in their own Na∣ture;
and nothing has been more the Misfortune
of this Affair before us.</P>
<P>I have spoken to this largely elsewhere, and
therefore shall say the less here; but without
doubt they who first represented this Design, as
an Undertaking to settle a Free Trade, with the
Consent, and by the Concession, of the Govern∣ment
of <HI>Spain</HI> to the Ports and Places possessed by
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> either ignorantly
amused themselves by their own wrong Concep∣tions
of Things; or formed these Notions, and
spread them about to amuse other People,
with a design to perplex their Heads about it, and
bring the Thing itself into Contempt, since no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
can tend more directly to render a Project
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, than to fill the Peoples Thoughts
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Notions of Things Impracticable in them∣selves,
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>
and then Banter them with the Impossibi∣lity
of putting them in Execution.</P>
<P>This is so much the worse too in this Case
by how much there was no Manner of Reason
or Occasion for this Mistake; and that the De∣sign
of Planting, Settling, and Possessing, as is
above noted on the Continent of <HI>America</HI> or <HI>South-Seas,</HI>
is every Way sufficient to all the Ends, and
to all the Reasonable Wishes, of the Government
in the First Proposal: Fruitful of all Manner of
Improvement, capable of as many, and indeed
many more, Advantages than the supposed Free
Trade with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions, which are
already planted; and this, if it were duly con∣sidered,
would set us right in our Thoughts
about it, I mean as to the Proposal of such a
Trade being Advantageous to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Subjects of this Project been Mer∣chants,
bred to Business, acquainted with Trade,
and whose Business it is as well to understand
as to seek out New Adventures, it had been
embraced with all imaginable Eagerness and
Satisfaction, far from being run down and blown
up in this Manner by the Town; the Disaster
lyes in this, as before noted, that the Debt and
the Trade going together is ill sorted with the
People it falls upon; they that are qualified to
claim the Debt, being some of them the worst
qualified to embark in the Trade of any People in
the Town, and consequently the best qualified
to find Fault with, and make a Noise about it.</P>
<P>No Men are so apt to dislike and complain of
a Thing, especially of this Nature, as those who
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
do not understand it; and as they are forwardest
to complain, so are they hardest to be answered
and satisfied by Reason; and this perhaps is not
the least Disafter which at present attends this
Project, which perhaps will never recover the
Blast of Reproach, thus cast upon it, but by
length of Time, the Remedy which Cures many
Distempers of the State besides this.</P>
<P>I know there is another Popular Reason given
us for the general Dislike of this Thing, and that
is, the obliging all the People to subscribe whe∣ther
they will or no; and much is said on this
Article, calling it a Force, an Invasion of Pro∣perty,
and a Breach of <HI>English</HI> Liberty.</P>
<P>Now, tho' the Act of Parliament may be
pleaded in Bar of this Charge; because, what is
done in Parliament is every Man's Act and Deed,
and a Voluntary Concession can be no Force; al∣so
it is no kind of a Force that the Law defends,
and the Nature of the Thing obliges to; yet is
here no real Force in the literal Sense, nor does
it say, that those who will not comply to sub∣scribe
his Debt shall never be paid; it does in∣deed
exclude them from the present Benefit, but
it takes away none of their Claim to both the
Principal and Interest from the Government, as
before. However, this is not my Business here,
the Parliament no question will defend the Ju∣stice
of their own Acts.</P>
<P>My Business now is to enquire how this lat∣ter
Trade, upon the Foot of a Colony or Planta∣tion,
can be carried on; for having Advanc'd, and,
I think, with good Reason, that it can be done no
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
other Way; if I do not shew you that it may ef∣fectually
be done this Way, I should be supposed
writing a Satyr upon the Undertaking, which I
assure you I am not.</P>
<P>The Design of possessing Part of <HI>America,</HI> I
think a Project worthy the Nation, and worthy
the Parliament; and that this War has been the
only Juncture for it that has happened these
Fifty Years, and the like whereof may never
happen again; I see no Misfortune in it, but its
being tack'd to the Debt above-mentioned; and
consequently, a Set of People, adapted to the
Concern, who are every Way unsuitable to it,
and uncapable of understanding it, better quali∣fied
to rail at it, than embark in it; this, I say,
I count the Misfortune of the Nation in it, and
nothing but an Exquisite Management can prevent
the Evil Effects of this Misfortune; nor had this
Disaster happened to it, but from the earnest De∣sire
the Proposers had to make the People some
amends, over and above, for the scop of Payment
they had met with in their Publick Debts; and in
any Age but ours perhaps it would ha' past for
an Amends, and for an Advantage, nay, in ours
it would ha' p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st so, had it not fallen upon such
a Promiscuous Multitude of People, not in Cir∣cumstances
to receive the Advantages, to under∣stand
the Thing, or put any Hand to help for∣ward
the Success of it.</P>
<P>If these Things have join'd in with the Pub∣lick
Uneasiness of the Times, to render the Pro∣ject,
as it now stands, unacceptable, I cannot
think that this does yet in the least lessen the
Value of a <HI>South-Sea</HI> Undertaking in general, as
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>
such and as it is; a taking Possession of some Part of
<HI>America,</HI> to establish an <HI>English</HI> Colony, and erect
a Trade thither from <HI>England,</HI> as aforesaid, against
which, (abstracted from the Ministry, the Publick
Credit, Parties and Factions, among us, with
which, in this Argument, I have nothing to do)
against this; I say, I believe no Man will raise
One Objection, but all unanimously agree▪ that
we wish to see it put in Execution, as a Foundati∣on,
upon which may be Built an Immense Trade,
a New, and very much Wanted Vent, for our
Manufactures of <HI>Britain,</HI> a New, and as
much Wanted, Vent for the Provisions, and Cat∣tle,
the Produce of our Colonies on the <HI>North</HI>
of <HI>America;</HI> and a wonderful Encrease of our
Navigation, Strength, and People.</P>
<P>It is Impossible for the Author of this to finish what
he had resolv'd to do here towards describing the
Nature of, and subsequent Measures for, pursuing
this Design. If this short Essay appears acceptable,
I may in a Second Part go forward with it, and
therein distinguish more plainly between carrying
on this Affair as an Improvement of Trade▪ and
carrying it on as a National Interest. I know
the Endeavours used to make it appear a Test
of Parties, and a Trial of Skill between Sides;
of this I shall take no Cognizance; but if a Se∣cond
Part of this Work comes to be Publish'd,
I shall endeavour rather to shew what you may
do, than what I fear you will not do.</P>
<P>I shall distinguish the Conquest of that Part we
may plant in, and the planting itself; or, in
short, between the Queen's Part and the Mer∣chants;
and shew you how absolutely necessary it
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
is that they be kept asunder. That the Trade must
be entirely unincumbered with War; that it is
the Governments Part, not only to take Possessi∣on,
but to keep the Possession when taken; that
Protection must be effectually provided for, or
else no Attempt can be Successful. I shall endea∣vour
to explain what this Protection will be, a∣gainst
whom, in what Manner needful, what
probable Opposition may be expected, and from
who.</P>
<P>2. I may give you an Essay at the Great Que∣stion
<HI>Where</HI> this Settlement may, or can, or must,
be made; and in doing this I may make Publick
some of the Schemes which I had the Honour to lay
were laid before his late Majesty in the Beginning
of this War, and which were so approved of both
by himself, and several of those whom his Majesty
was pleased to communicate them to, that nothing
but the unhappy Death of that Glorious Prince
prevented that this Attempt, (instead of that which
has proved so fatal at <HI>Barcelona,</HI>) had taken up the
last Seven Years▪ with the Blood and Treasure
of this Nation, which in all Probability e'er now
would have brought back as many Millions as the
other has carried out.</P>
<P>3. I shall in such an Essay give convincing
Proofs, that if such an Attempt may be made,
and in due Manner carried on, such a Trade may
be raised from it as shall sufficiently recompence
the Long, Tedious and Expensive Fatigues of
the Whole War.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="45"/>
I shall conclude this with what I heartily wish▪</P>
<P>1. That those Two likely and encouraging
Prospects of the Publick Good had not been
thus unhappily join'd.</P>
<P>2. That the Parliament may, if it pleases
God so far to enlighten them, yet separate
them, or rather restore them to their Inde∣pendent
Existence, which I doubt not would e∣qually
satisfie the People concern'd, the First
Proposer, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>And what the Advantage of both to the Nati∣on
might be in such a Restored, Separated Estate,
shall be the Subject of farther Consideration.</P>
