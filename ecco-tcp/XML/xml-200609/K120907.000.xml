<P>THis Day a Messenger (on a Highflying
Sorrel Horse) came Post from Dr. <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>l,</HI>
and rode as if the Devil drove him, to
signifie to our M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>r, <HI>That he designed to visit us</HI>;
upon which the wild, frantick, fiery, zealous Ma∣gistrate
summon'd his Brethren, the Ald<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="__"/>men,
to meet at the Common-Hall; but before they
were all Assembled, another Messenger brought
Advice, <HI>That the Champion was just at hand</HI>; so
that Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>r, and those with him, went to
the Town's End (clad in old fashion'd Forma∣lities)
to meet him. They found him very well
guarded by a vast Rabble and Mob, crying (with
loud Acclamations) <HI>Nonresistance! Nonresi∣stance!</HI>
Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>r, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (headed by one that
Records) Congratulated him upon his Deliver∣ance,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then the Publick Entry was or∣dered
as followeth:</P>
<P>FIrst came the Bellman and Sexton of the
Town, with Staves in their Hands.</P>
<P>Then Two Pursivants, bearing Pendants, with
the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>r's Crest (Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the XI's Head)
and his Motto in these Words, <HI>Ʋnlimited Passive
Obedience.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Then a Herald, carrying his Coat-Armour,
being a Field Sable, charged with Three Cardi∣nals
Caps, each with a Golden Band.</P>
<P>Then followed Two Old Women, one having
a Bundle of Addresses on her Back, and a Paper
on her Breast, with this Inscription, <HI>We defie all
Anti-Monarchial, Anti-Episcopal, and</HI> [almost all]
<HI>Atheistical and Popish Principles</HI>; the other was
covered all over with Pamphlets of divers sorts;
before her was <HI>The Elegy on High-Church Passive
Obedience,</HI> and <HI>The Champion pleading his own
Cause,</HI> but on her Bum the Effigies of <HI>Ben. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y,</HI>
with his Head downward.</P>
<P>Then the Serjeant of the Town, with a Mace
on his Shoulder.</P>
<P>Then came Mr. M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>y<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="_"/>r, with a Book in his
Hand, (upside down, according to Custom)
Intituled, <HI>The Perils of False Brethren both in
Church and State.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Ald<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="__"/>men (Two by Two) having
<HI>The Collections</HI> in their Hands.</P>
<P>Here followed a young Damsel, <HI>who had a Pro∣mise
from the</HI> High-C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>h Faction, <HI>to have any
thing she requested</HI>; whereupon she desired the
Head of <HI>Benj. H.</HI> which she brought in a <HI>Charger.</HI></P>
<P>Then 6 Men with Red Hats, having Beads in
their Hands, with this Inscription on their Fore∣heads,
<HI>Nunc aut Nunquam.</HI></P>
<P>Then an Old Man, with a long Beard, clothed
in pure white Raiment; having the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>r's Ef∣figies
[in Metzotinto] in one Hand, and in the
other, a Trinklet resembling a Cru<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>fix.</P>
<P>Then followed the Old Women with Green
Branches in their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Then a Woman, preciously deck'd, sitting (<HI>as
near as I could guess</HI>) upon a Scarlet-colour'd
Beast, having abundance of Names, written in
Capital Letters, <HI>MYSTERY,</HI> &amp;c</P>
<P>Then came the High-Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>ch IDOL [<HI>in
Garments as black as his Deeds</HI>] on a Sorrel Horse.</P>
<P>After him 24 Tinkers, beating on their Ket∣tles,
that the Spectators might know what La∣titude
they were in.</P>
<P>Then a vast Mob, hollowing, hooping and
playing the Devil.</P>
<P>In this Order he was conducted to his Inn,
where he was again Congratulated, and present∣ed
with Wine. In fine, the Evening concluded
with Ringing of Bells, Bonfires, Drunkenness,
and all manner of Lewdness.</P>
<P>The Champion left this Town next Morning,
and set out for <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>ck,</HI> where he was again
met, and Congratulated by the Monkeys in
their Formalities. They entreated him to tarry
some time with them; but he declined it, and
pursued his Journey to the next Corporation;
for, you must know, he expects the same Honours
to be paid him where-ever he goes; which (how
strange soever it may seem to some) is no new
thing; for he's not the first that has been waited
on by a Corporation in their Robes; for in the
Reign of Q. <HI>Eliz.</HI> a Fellow, who wore his Hat
button'd up on one side, and a Feather therein,
like a Tooth-drawer, with a Rose and Crown
on his Breast for a Badge, got a License to make
a Show of a great <HI>APE</HI> about the Country:
And coming to a certain Town, [☞Whether
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
<HI>Banbury,</HI> or not, I can't tell] they beat a Drum
about to give Notice, That there was a very
witty Ape to be seen; but the Towns-People,
being poor, thought it not worth their while
to see this sight; upon which the Fellow was
enraged, and was resolved to put a Trick upon
them; and thereupon sends the following War∣rant
to the Worshipful the Mayor.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">THese are to Require you, and every one
of you, with your Wives and Families,
(upon sight hereof) to make your personal Ap∣pearance
before the Queen's Ape, who is a Per∣son
of Rank and Quality, and of vast Parts, he
having been bred at an University; and is to
visit most Parts of the Kingdom, that by his
Conversation with the Queen's Subjects, he may
be the better enabled to discover their Fidelity and
Loyalty. Hereof fail not at your Peril.</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Mayor had open'd the Warrant, he
(who always did what he pleas'd) holds it topsie
turvy, and after some thoughts thereon, sends
his Maid to the further end of the Town, for a
Shoemaker to come and read it. When he heard
the Contents, he summon'd his Brethren the Al∣dermen
to the Town-Hall, to consult of this
weighty Affair; where they sat looking on one
another for some time, not knowing what to
say: At length the youngest Alderman, standing
up, said, <HI>Gentlemen, If I may speak without Offence,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<HI>I'll give you my Opinion in this Matter. — Speak on,</HI>
says Mr. Mayor, <HI>for though you are but a young Officer,
you may speak as much Sense as any of us. — Well
then,</HI> says he, <HI>my humble Opinion is, That this Ape-Fellow
is a sawcy Knave, and only designs to make our Town
ridiculous: For was it ever known, that a Warrant should
be sent, without either Name or Date, to a Mayor of a
Town, who is the Queen's Lieutenant; and that he, and his
Brethren, their Wives and Children, should be commanded
to appear before a</HI> Jackanapes? <HI>My Council is therefore,
That you take him and his Ape, and whip the whole Tribe
out of Town, which will be much to your Credit and Reputa∣tion.</HI>
The Words were scarce spoke, e're a grave Al∣derman
reply'd, <HI>Hold, Friend, you have spoke little less
than Treason; Remember 'tis the Queen's Ape. — True,
Brother,</HI> quoth the Mayor, <HI>therefore it behoves us to take
care what we say in this troublesom Business. — Marry,</HI>
says another grave Senior, <HI>we may see by the Feather in
his Cap, and the Badge he wears, that he is the Queen's
Man; and who knows what an Injury he may do us poor
Men in the Country for contemning the Warrant? there∣fore
let us e'ne go and see the Ape; 'tis but</HI> 2 d. <HI>apiece, and
no doubt but the Queen will tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it well, when she hears we
have shown so much Reverence to her Ape.</HI> — Upon this
Speech the Assembly resolved to pay the Ape a Visit,
and ordered the Town-Clerk to acquaint the Queen's
Man therewith.</P>
<P>Next Day the Mayor and Aldermen in their Robes,
(<HI>the Serjeant carrying the Mace before them, their Recorder
being at the Head of them</HI>) with whole Droves of
Townsmen, and their Wives, <HI>&amp;c. attended the Ape at
his Inn</HI>; where they found him sitting on a Table;
Mr. <HI>Mayor</HI> presented him with Wine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off his Hat,
and made a Leg; but Pag did not mind him. Next came
Mrs. <HI>Mayoress,</HI> in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Apron, and made <HI>Pug</HI> a
fine low Courtisie; upon which he put out his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and made a Mouth. — <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> quoth she, <HI>I think in
my Conscience, the Queen's Ape mocks me. — Sirrah,</HI> says
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
the Mayor, <HI>I see thy sawciness, and I'll make thee to know
that the Woman, whom thou mockest, is my Wife, an An∣cient
Woman, and a Midwife, and one who is old enough
to be thy Mother.</HI> And thereupon going to his Tutor,
<HI>Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>do you allow your Ape to abuse my Wife? — 
No,</HI> quoth he. — <HI>Truly,</HI> says the Mayor, <HI>there's sufficient
witness that saw him make Mops and Mows at her.</HI> — The
Tutor thereupon gave poor <HI>Pug</HI> half a Dozen smart
Lashes with his Whip, which made his Teeth chatter;
upon which Mr. <HI>Mayor</HI> cried out, <HI>Enough, Enough:
Good Sir, you have done like a Gentleman: I desire you
never to give Correction any more in your Wrath: And when
the Play is done, be pleased to come along with your Ape to
our Town-Hall, both of you to take a small Supper with me,
and the rest of my Brethren the Aldermen.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our Champion: After he had visited
several Corporations, and given Audience to the Mob,
(who were wonderfully taken with this new Raree-Show)
he dispatches a Trumpeter to <HI>Cov<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="__+"/>ry,</HI> to
give Notice of his coming. — The Bells immediately
rung for Joy: — But that avail'd him nothing; for the
Monkeys did not appear in their Robes! which was a
great Mortification to him, and those of his Faction.
However, he was met by 10 or 12 stiff Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> on
Sorrel Nags, attended by a few Butchers and Barbers,
who made a Purse, and bought Two Hogsheads of Ale,
which were set in the Publick Street, where the Rabble
got shamefully drunk in Toasting a Health to their be∣loved
IDOL.</P>
