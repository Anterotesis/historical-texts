<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE present Volume pretends to no other
merit, than that of being a laborious selection
of the most interesting parts of the various
ANA. To these valuable stores of Literature
I have added some Anecdotes, which appeared
to me amusive and curious; and some Obser∣vations,
which, I hope, will not be deemed im∣pertinent.</P>
<P>The ANA form a body of Literature not
universally known. It may, therefore, be use∣ful
to inform the reader, that in the early part
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
of the last century, it was prevailing custom
to take down for publication the Conversations,
or '<HI>Table-Talk,</HI>' as they have been sometimes
called, of the most eminent Wits and Scholars.
To satisfy the demands of Famine, rather than
those of Literature, some men were prompted to
sell their Collections to the Booksellers; and it
may be fairly presumed, were less attentive
to the richness of the materials then to the
number of pages they were calculated to fill.
Others published them at the death of a va∣lued
Friend, to display the extent of his science,
or the felicity of his genius; and it must be
confessed, that even these were not so scrupulous
as they should have been of what they ad∣mitted
into their Collections.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Had such Repositories of Literature been
judiciously formed, they would, have proved
a valuable acquisition to the Republic
of Letters: but their respective Compilers
have evinced great inattention, or little dis∣cernment;
nothing was discriminated in the
mass of their materials; they appear to have
listened to the mouth of the Scholar whose
sentiments they record, as the credulous Enthu∣siast
did in ancient times to the Oracle he wor∣shipped.
Thus, whatever was unintelligible,
obscure, or even false, was held by these Lite∣rary
Devotees in as great reverence as it's op∣posite.</P>
<P>It has been repeatedly urged, and allowed,
that the matter of elaborate Treatises, and even
ponderous Volumes, may not infrequently be
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
comprized in concise Essays, or short Remarks.
Some things of this kind are attempted in the
present Volume; and I have been prompted
towards it's publication, by a conviction that
it will furnish much useful information to the
generality of readers.</P>
<P>It is not just, however, that curiosity should
be raised too high. If expectations are formed,
which are impossible to be gratified, abilities
infinitely superior to mine must be humbled.
All the Anecdotes I offer will not be new: of
some, I pretend only to remind the reader; but
the greater part, I have frequently been tempted
to believe, will appear interesting.</P>
<P>The fashionable and commercial world are
too much occupied to attend to serious discus∣sion
and scientific research: the one labori∣ously
<PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
occupied in doing nothing, and the other
indefatigable in doing every thing. To the
literary labourer they leave the cultivation of
the fields and the gardens of Literature: they
are willing to purchase the productions of his
talents; but they expect to receive only the fruits
and the flowers. To such, who form indeed the
generality of readers, it is presumed, the pre∣sent
Collection will not be found unuseful.
Whatever is most interesting in books rarely to
be met with, or whatever is most agreeable in
compilations which it would be impossible for
them to peruse with patience, is here selected:
and, if it is not presumptuous to add, the Man
of Letters, at the same time, may be reminded
of important Observations, striking Anecdotes,
and attic Pleasantries; which, however they
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
deserve to be retained, will, without some Vade
Mecum of this kind, soon escape from the
most tenacious memory. In a word, if this
Collection answers the hopes of the Editor,
it will be found a Miscellany not unamusive
to the Literary Lounger.</P>
<P>As I have acknowledged that this Volume con∣tains,
for the most part, only a Collection from
the Works of others, some Aristarchus may sa∣gaciously
discover, that it is not difficult to
make books in this manner. With this I
shall agree. But it will be admitted, that it
has cost some care and some labour to collect
these materials. Should the useful and the
agreeable be found blended, I believe the
Public care little whether the Author has
written every sentence himself; or, like me,
<PB N="xi" REF="9"/>
stands deeply indebted to the works of other
Writers.</P>
<P>To improve an arrangement which is not al∣ways
so perfect as I could wish, I have added a
copious INDEX: each Article also is titled, so
that wherever the book is opened, the subject
discussed immediately appears.</P>
<P>To be useful, and to please the Public, is my
design. My Work is not adapted to extend,
or to bestow, reputation: it is sufficient, if it
attains it's humble pretension. A multifarious
Collection of this kind stands in great need of
Critical Candour: yet I should feel myself
little solicitous concerning it's reception, if I
were certain that the urbanity of the Critic was
to dicide it's fate.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>THE PERSECUTED LEARNED.</HEAD>
<P>VIRGILIUS, Bishop of Salisbury, hav∣ing
written, that there existed Anti∣podes;
Boniface, Archbishop of Mayence, the
Pope's Legate, declared him a heretic, and
consigned him to the flames.</P>
<P>Galileo, because he believed in the Copernican
System, now universally established, was con∣demned
at Rome publicly to disavow sentiments
the truth of which must have been to him
abundantly manifest.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="15"/>
The most valued of Gabriel Naudé's works
is his Apology for those great Men who have
been accused of Magic. In that book, he has
recorded a melancholy number of the most
eminent scholars, who have found, that to have
been successful in their studies, was a success
which harrassed them with a continued perse∣cution,
that sometimes led them into the prison,
and sometimes bound them to the stake.</P>
<P>Urbé Grandier, for whose life, replete with
interesting anecdote, I refer the reader to
Bayle, was burnt alive through the machina∣tions
of a rival, who formed a conspiracy
against this amiable and unfortunate scholar,
by contriving to get the depositions of some
nuns to prove the crime of magic. These wo∣men
must have been guilty of the most horrid
perjuries.</P>
<P>Cornelius Agrippa was necessitated to fly his
country, and the enjoyments of a rich income,
merely for having displayed a few philosophical
experiments which now every school-boy can
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
perform. The people beheld him as an object
of horror; and not infrequently, when he
walked the streets, he found them empty at
his approach. He died, of disease and famine,
in an hospital.</P>
<P>In the present day, when the lights of philo∣sophy
have become so generally expanded, we
perceive the little foundation of all these accusa∣tions
of magic. What a dreadful chain must
there have been of perjuries and conspiracies!
One is willing to imagine, for the honour of
human nature, that so deep a malignity, and
so sedate a cruelty, could not have tainted the
heart of men; but the simple recital of history
forms, too often, the severest satire on human
nature.</P>
<P>Our great Roger Bacon, by a degree of pene∣tration
which perhaps has never been equalled,
discovered some of the most occult secrets in
Nature. She seems, indeed—if I may so ex∣press
myself—to have stood naked before him.
His honours have been stolen from him by
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
more modern authors, who have appeared in∣ventors
when they were copying Bacon. Yet,
for the reward of all his intense studies, the
holy brethren, and the infallible Majesty of
Rome, occasioned him to languish in prison
during the greater part of his life.</P>
<P>The catalogue of the Persecuted Learned is
indeed voluminous. We need not waste our
tears on fictitious sorrows, while the remem∣brance
of these men shall exist!</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>FRIAR BACON.</HEAD>
<P>MY zeal for the memory of this illustrious
scholar impels me to transcribe, which it will
be found I seldom do, from a book that is in
every body's hands. From the faithful and
laborious Henry, have I collected what follows
concerning Roger Bacon—</P>
<P>' We cannot but lament that Friar Bacon
met with so many discouragements in the pur∣suit
of useful knowledge. If he had lived in
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
better times, or if he had even been permitted
to prosecute that course of enquiries and expe∣riments
in which he engaged after his return
from Paris, it is highly probable that the world
would have many valuable discoveries that are
still unknown.</P>
<P>' An excellent modern writer, Dr. Friend,
having enumerated some of Bacon's discoveries,
adds—"These are wonderful discoveries for a
man to make in so ignorant an age, who had
no master to teach him, but struck it all out of
his own brain: but it is still more wonderful
that such discoveries should lie so long con∣cealed;
till, in the next succeeding centuries,
other people should start up, and lay claim to
those very inventions to which Bacon alone
had a right."</P>
<P>' Bacon discovered the art of making Read∣ing-glasses,
the Camera Obscura, Microscopes,
Telescopes, and various other mathematical and
astronomical instruments. He discovered a
method of performing all the chymical opera∣tions
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
that are now in use. He combined the
mechanical powers in so wonderful a manner,
that it was for this he was accused of magic.
His discoveries in medicine were by no means
unimportant. That the ingredients of gun∣powder,
and the art of making it, were well
known to him, is now undeniable: but the
<HI>humane philosopher,</HI> dreading the consequences
of communicating this discovery to the world,
transposed the letters of the Latin words which
signify Charcoal, which made the whole obscure.
It was done thus—<HI>Luru mope can vbre,</HI> (<HI>car∣bonum
pulvere.</HI>) By this means he rendered it
difficult to discover this dangerous secret by the
perusal of his works; and, at the same time,
secured to himself the honour of having known
it, by specifying the other ingredients, if it
should be discovered by any other person.
This accordingly happened after Bacon's
death; for, about the beginning of the four∣teenth
century, one Barthold Schwartz, a Ger∣man
monk, and chymist, accidentally disco∣vered
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
gunpowder, as he was pounding salt∣petre,
sulphur, and charcoal, in a mortar, for
some other purpose.'</P>
<P>To this we may add, that the Chinese em∣ployed
gunpowder in their wars; and were
familiar with the art of printing, probably,
some centuries before we made use of them in
Europe.</P>
<P>Though Bacon is mentioned, in this artical,
as the inventor of optical glasses, Marville gives
a curious piece of information. He says, that
'it is generally known, that James Metius, a
Dutchman, invented, in 1609, <HI>spectacles</HI> and
<HI>telescopes</HI>; and that Galileo, being at Venice,
imitated as well as he could a telescope, and
astonished the learned Venetians from the
tower of St. Mark with this novel invention.'
And he adds—'But there are <HI>few</HI> who know
that the <HI>principles</HI> of optics, on which telescopes
are formed, are to be found in <HI>Euclid,</HI> and in
the antient geometricians; and that it is through
want of reflection that this wonderful inven∣tion,
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
<HI>as well as many others,</HI> have remained so
long concealed in the majesty of Nature, as
Pliny expresses it, till chance has drawn them
out.'</P>

<HEAD>THE RECOVERY OF MANUSCRIPTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a Florentine who found buried in a
heap of dust, and in a rotten coffer belonging
to the monastery of Saint Gal, the works of
Quintilian; and, by this fortunate discovery,
gave them to the Republic of Letters.</P>
<P>Papirius Masson found, in the house of a
book-binder of Lyons, the works of Agobart.
The mechanic was on the point of using the
manuscripts to line the covers of his books.</P>
<P>Raimond Soranzo, a celebrated lawyer in the
Papal Court at Avignon, about the middle of
the fourteenth century, had in his possession the
two books of Cicero on Glory. He made a
present of them to Petrarch, who lent them to
an aged and poor man of letters, formerly his
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>
preceptor. Urged by extreme poverty, the old
man pawned them; and, returning home, died
suddenly, without having revealed where he
had left them: since which time they have
never been recovered.</P>
<P>Leonard Aretin was one of the most distin∣guished
scholars at the dawn of literature; but
he has done that which reflects on him great
dishonour. He found a Greek manuscript of
Procopius <HI>de Bello Gothico.</HI> This he translated
into Latin, and published the work as his own.
Since, however, other manuscripts of the same
work have been discovered; and the fraud of
Leonard Aretin is apparent.</P>
<P>Machiavel acted more adroitly in a similar
case. A manuscript of the Apophthegms of the
Ancients, by Plutarch, having fallen into his
hands, he selected those which pleased him,
and put them into the mouth of one of his
heroes.</P>
<P>A page of the second Decade of Livy was
found by a man of letters on the parchment of
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
his battledore, as he was amusing himself in
the country. He ran directly to the maker of
the battledore: but arrived too late; the man
had finished the last page of Livy, in compleat∣ing
a large order for these articles about a
week before.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Cotton, being one day at his
tailor's, discovered that the man held in his
hand, ready to be cut up for measures, the ori∣ginal
Magna Charta, with all it's appendages of
seals and signatures. He bought this singular

It is not probable—for he was, I believe, igno∣rant

<HEAD>SKETCHES OF CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Yes, should Great Homer lift his aweful head,</L>
<L>Zoilus again would start up from the dead!</L></Q>
<P>THE greatest authors of antiquity have
smarted under the lash of Criticism. Chevrau
has collected a great number of instances. Lest
I should prove tedious, I only select a few.</P>
<P>It was given out, that Homer had stolen from
Hesiod whatever was most remarkable in the
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>
Iliad and Odyssey. The Emperor Caligula
suppressed the works of this great poet; and
gave, for reason, that he certainly had as much
right as Plato, who had so severely condemned
him.</P>
<P>Sophocles was brought to trial by his chil∣dren
as a lunatic: and some, who blamed
the inequalities of this poet, have also con∣demned
the vanity of Pindar; the hard and
rough verses of Aeschylus; and the manner in
which Euripides conducted his plots.</P>
<P>Socrates, who has even been compared to
Jesus Christ, as the wisest and the most moral
of men, Cicero has treated as an usurer, and
Athenaeus as an illiterate person. Mr. Cum∣berland,
in one of his Observers, has industri∣ously
revived a calumny which most assuredly
only took it's rise from the malignant buffoonery
of Aristophanes; who, as Jortin says, was a
great wit, but a great rascal. Should some fu∣ture
author draw his anecdotes from the writ∣ings
of Foote, or of Peter Pindar, we know
well that he might delineate a spirited cha∣racter;
<PB N="13" REF="26"/>
but nothing, at the same time, would
be more fictitious.</P>
<P>Plato, who has been called, by Clement of
Alexandria, the Moses of Athens; the Philo∣sopher
of the Christians, by Arnobius; and
the God of Philosophers, by Cicero; has un∣dergone
a variety of criticisms. Athenaeus
accuses him of envy; Theopompus, of lying;
Suidas, of avarice; Aulus Gellius, of robbery;
Porphyry, of incontinence; and Aristophanes,
of impiety.</P>
<P>Aristotle, who according to some writers
has composed more than four hundred vo∣lumes,
and who for his work on animals re∣ceived
from Alexander eight hundred talents,
has not been less spared by the critics. Dio∣genes
Laertius, Cicero, and Plutarch, have
forgotten nothing that can tend to shew his
ignorance, his ambition, and his vanity.</P>
<P>If the reader does not feel himself weary, he
may read on.</P>
<P>Virgil is destitute of invention, if we are to
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>
give credit to Pliny, Carbilius, and Seneca.
Caligula has absolutely denied him even medi∣ocrity;
Herennus has marked his faults; and
Perilius Faustinus has furnished a thick vo∣lume
with his plagiarisms. Even the author of
his Apology has confessed, that he has stolen
from Homer his greatest beauties.</P>
<P>Horace censures the coarse humour of Plau∣tus;
and Horace, in his turn, has been blamed
for fiction and obscurity.</P>
<P>The majority of the critics regard Pliny's
History only as a pleasing romance; and
seem to have quite as little respect for Quintus
Curtius.</P>
<P>Pliny cannot bear Diodorus and Vopiscus;
and, in one comprehensive criticism, treats all
the historians as narrators of fables.</P>
<P>Livy has been reproached for his aversion
to the Gauls; Dion, for his hatred of the Re∣public;
Velleius Paterculus, for speaking too
kindly of the vices of Tiberius; and Hero∣dotus
and Plutarch, for their excessive par∣tiality
<PB N="15" REF="28"/>
to their own country. Others have
said of Cicero, that there is no connection,
and, to adopt their own figure, no <HI>blood</HI> and
<HI>nerves,</HI> in what his admirers so warmly ex∣tol.
They say, he is cold in his extempo∣raneous
effusions, too artificial in his exor∣diums,
trifling in his strained witticisms, and
tiresome in his digressions.</P>
<P>Quintilian does not spare Seneca; and De∣mosthenes,
called by Cicero the Prince of
Orators, has, according to Hermippus, more of
art than of nature. To Demades, his ora∣tions
appear too much laboured; others have
thought him too dry; and, if we may trust
Eschines, his language is by no means pure.</P>
<P>Should we proceed with this list to our
own country, and our own times, it might be
curiously augmented; but, perhaps, enough has
been said, to soothe irritated genius, and to shame
fastidious criticism. 'I would beg the critics
to remember,' the Earl of Roscommon writes,
in his Preface to his Version of Horace's Art
<PB N="16" REF="29"/>
of Poetry, 'that Horace owed his favour and
his fortune to the character given of him by
Virgil and Varius; that Fundanius and Pollio
are still valued by what Horace says of them;
and that, in their Golden Age, there was a good
understanding among the ingenious, and those
who were the most esteemed were the best∣natured.'
I would hope, in spite of the daily
cries we hear from disappointed writers, that
those Journalists, whose style and sentiments
render them respectable in the eyes of every
man of letters, maintain with rigid integrity
the fountains of criticism pure and incor∣rupt.
They cannot be insensible that their
volumes are not merely read, and then forgot∣ten;
but that they will remain as surviving
witnesses, for or against them, from century to
century.</P>

<HEAD>TARTARIAN LIBRARIES.</HEAD>
<P>CARDINAL Perron, in the Perroniana, has
the following curious article of intelligence:
'In that part of Tartary which belongs to
the kingdom of Persia there exists a flourishing
university, where the Arabs cultivate literature.
Gioan Baptista Remondi, who was the first
who caused books in the Arabic language to
be printed in Europe, and who had even
studied in this university, has pretended to say,
that there were a number of Arabic books
translated from many Greek authors who re∣main
unknown to the Europeans. It was the
Arabians who have preserved a book of Archi∣medes:
with many authors who have written
on mathematics; such as Apollonius Pergeaeus,
and even Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen.'</P>
<P>To this account may be added that which
Bell has given us in his Travels to Tartary.
It is—'That in Siberia there exists an uncom∣mon
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
library, the rooms of which are filled with
scrolls of glazed paper, fairly wrote, and many
of them in gilt characters. The language in
which they are written is that of the Tongusts,
or Calmucs. Perhaps,' he adds, 'they may
contain some valuable pieces of antiquity, par∣ticularly
ancient history.'</P>
<P>At Mount Athos, Mr. Andrews, in his Anec∣dotes,
informs us, 'That travellers agree there
are several monasteries with libraries full of
books, which are illegible to those holy bro∣therhoods,
but whose contents are probably
well worth inspection.'</P>
<P>Every captain, who can write his own log∣book,
has of late obtruded his discoveries of
every ten yards of land he has happened to ob∣serve,
and worked up into pathos his account of
storms and short provisions. If they would,
in their voyages, endeavour to bring some in∣formation,
or some materials of this kind, to
Europe, a new source of knowledge would be
opened to our contemplation; many books,
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>
which are now lost, might probably be reco∣vered;
Science might be enlarged, and Amuse∣ment
gratified.</P>

<HEAD>THE BIBLIOMANIA.</HEAD>
<P>SHOULD ever the idea thrown out in the
last article be put into practice, the learned
must be careful, in their zeal, of not becoming
the dupes of the artful illiterate. The present
anecdote may serve as a beacon.</P>
<P>The Bibliomania, or the collecting an enor∣mous
heap of books, has long been the rage
with some who would fain pass themselves
upon us for men of vast erudition. Some, in∣dulging
this luxury of literature, desirous of
forming an immense and curious library, have
scoured all Europe, and sent out travellers to
the Indies to discover ancient books, or scarce
manuscripts. This has occasioned many cheats
and impositions. Towards the end of the last
century, some ignorant or knavish men sent to
<PB N="20" REF="33"/>
Paris a number of Arabic manuscripts, in ex∣cellent
condition and clear characters. They
were received with all imaginable respect by
the eager collectors of books; they were ra∣pidly
purchased at a high price: but, lo! when
they were examined by the connoisseurs, these
manuscripts, which were held so inestimable,
were discovered to be books of accounts and
registers, cleanly transcribed by certain Arabian
merchants.—<HI>Risum teneatis, Amici!</HI></P>
<P>A similar imposition was practised on the
great Peiresc. It was reported, that the
Ethiopians were in possession of a book writ∣ten
by Enoch. Many literati in Europe had
long ardently desired to inspect it, as they
imagined it would contain many valuable se∣crets
and unknown histories. Upon this, some
impostor having got an Ethiopic book into his
hands, he wrote for the title, '<HI>The Prophecies
and History of Enoch,</HI>' upon the front page.
M. Peiresc no sooner heard of it, than he pur∣chased
it of the impostor for a considerable sum
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
of money. Being afterwards placed in Car∣dinal
Mazarine's library, there Ludolf, famous
for his skill in Ethiopic literature, had access
to it; when, lo! this History of Enoch was
discovered to be nothing more than a Gnostic
Treatise upon the Mysteries of Heaven and
Earth, but which did not mention one word
concerning Enoch.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>THE TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>CHARPENTIER, in the Carpenteriana, says
that the Turks, whom the vulgar literati re∣gard
as having neglected the sciences and
literature in general, have many particular and
general histories, from Osman, the first of their
emperors, to the present. In the library of the
King of France, there are a number of these
historians. None have yet been translated, but
the Annals of Leunclavius; which, however,
are not very considerable. The library of the
Great Turk forms a part of his treasures; and
<PB N="22" REF="35"/>
there are historians paid by him, who record,
with care and accuracy, the actions and the
conquests of their Princes.</P>
<P>There are colleges established at Constan∣tinople,
where the Alcoran, the Mathematics,
and Rhetoric, are taught: but it is principally
at Cairo where there are a multitude of scho∣lars,
who live by transcribing books; as once
was practised in the university of Paris, where
the scribes assembled, sometimes to the number
of twenty or thirty thousand. The invention
of the art of printing having deprived them of
the means of subsistence, they have disap∣peared.
It is to prevent the same inconvenience,
that printing is prohibited throughout the Ot∣toman
Empire.</P>
<P>When a Jew, who was a famous Dutch
printer, brought to Constantinople printing-presses,
&amp;c. to introduce the art of printing in
that city, the Vizir caused him to be hanged;
declaring, that it would be a great cruelty that
one man should enrich himself by taking the
<PB N="23" REF="36"/>
bread of eleven thousand scribes, who gained
their living by their pen.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>THE PORTRAITS OF AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the ancients, it was undoubtedly a
custom to place the portraits of Authors
before their works. Martial will serve as a
testimony in this case. The hundred and
eighty-sixth Epigram of his fourteenth Book
is a mere play on words, concerning a little
volume which contained the works of Virgil,
and which had his portrait prefixed to it. The
volume and the characters must have been
very diminutive. Antiquity records many such
penmen, whose glory consisted in writing in
so small a hand, that it was not legible to the
naked eye. One wrote a verse of Homer on a
grain of millet; and another, more trifling
and indefatigable, transcribed the whole Iliad
in so consined a space, that it could be inclosed
in a nut shell. Menage says, that these things
<PB N="24" REF="37"/>
are not so improbable as they seem. This
trifling art is not lost in modern times. He
says, he has read whole sentences which were
not perceptible to the eye without the assistance
of the microscope. He has even seen <HI>portraits</HI>
and <HI>pictures</HI> of the same kind; and, which
seems wonderful, what appeared lines and
scratches thrown down at random, were letters
in capitals: and the lineaments of Madame
la Dauphiné's face were preserved with the
most pleasing delicacy, and with correctness of
resemblance. He read also an Italian poem,
in <HI>praise</HI> of this princess, which contained
<HI>some thousands</HI> of verses; [I transcribe his words]
It was written, by an officer, in a space of a
foot and a half.</P>
<P>Martial is not the only writer who takes
notice of the ancients prefixing their portraits
to their works. Seneca, in his ninth chapter
on the Tranquillity of the Soul, complains of
many of the luxurious great, who—like so
many of our own—possessed libraries as they
<PB N="25" REF="38"/>
do their estates and equipages. 'It is melan∣choly
to observe,' he continues, 'how the
portraits of men of genius, and the works of
their divine intelligence, but serve as the luxury
and the ornaments of their walls.'</P>
<P>Pliny has nearly the same observation.
<HI>Lib.</HI> xxxv. <HI>cap.</HI> 2. he remarks, that the custom
was rather modern in his time; and attributes
to Asinius Pollio the honour of having intro∣duced
it into Rome. 'In consecrating,' he
says, 'a library with the portraits of our il∣lustrious
authors, you have formed, if I may
so express myself, a republic of the intellectual
powers of men.'</P>

<HEAD>CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY after the re-establishment of letters,
(Huet writes) Criticism formed the chief occu∣pation
of those who applied themselves to their
cultivation. This was very necessary, after so
many ages of ignorance. They were obliged,
<PB N="24" REF="39"/>

<PB N="25" REF="40"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="41"/>
if we may so express ourselves, to disperse the
dust, to efface the mouldy spots, and to kill the
worms that gnawed and disfigured those ma∣nuscripts
which had escaped the fury of the
Barbarians, and the depredations of Time.</P>
<P>It was thus the art of criticism flourished in
all it's vigour, and was distinguished by it's
useful labours, during two centuries. The su∣preme
degree of erudition, consisted in bring∣ing
to light the ancient authors in the cor∣rection
of the errors of the scribes, through
whose hands they had passed, either by col∣lating
them with the best copies, or exerting
their own judgment and learning to the re∣storing
of those passages which were evidently
corrupt. At length, this avocation degenerated
into a low and obscure study, the chief merit
of which consisted in the recovery and collation
of the best manuscripts. This was the em∣ployment
of Gruter during his whole life.
Those to whom these assistances failed, em∣ployed
their critical acumen and literature to
<PB N="27" REF="42"/>
give the ancient writers in all their purity;
but, not infrequently, they dismembered that
which before was entire, and occasioned an
infinity of labours to the critics, their suc∣cessors,
who were somewhat more judicious
than themselves in restoring the passages to
their original state, and in healing those wounds
and unmerciful lacerations which they had
undergone.</P>
<P>Amongst these latter critics, Casaubon, Sal∣masius,
and Gronovius, hold distinguished
rank.</P>
<P>Now that the best authors are no more
scarce, but multiplied without end by the in∣vention
of printing, verbal criticism, the chief
merit of which is to catch syllables, deserves
no longer our esteem. Critics of this kind
may, not unaptly, be compared to weeders;
they eradicate the worthless plants, and leave
to more skilful cultivators the art of gathering
and distinguishing the more valuable ones.</P>

<P>NOTHING is so capable of disordering the

Judicial Astrology. While we are young, we

but it shews a great defect in judgment
to be occupied on them in an advanced age.
'It is proper, however,' Fontenelle remarks,
'to apply one's self to these enquiries; be∣cause
we find, as we proceed, many valuable
discoveries of which we were before ignorant.'
The same thought Cowley has applied, in an
address to his mistress, thus—<Q><L>Altho' I think thou never wilt be found,</L>
<L>Yet I'm resolv'd to search for thee:</L>
<L>The search itself rewards the pains.</L>

<HEAD>THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the present article, I am little more than
the translator of the lively and ingenious Vig∣neul
Marville.</P>
<P>The Republic of Letters is of an ancient
date. It appears by the pillars Josephus has
noticed, on which were engraven the principles
of the sciences, that this republic existed be∣fore
the Deluge; at least, it cannot be denied
that, soon after this great catastrophe, the
sciences flourished.</P>
<P>Never was a republic greater, better peopled,
more free, or more glorious: it is spread on
the face of the earth, and is composed of per∣sons
of every nation, of every rank, of every
age, and of both sexes. They are intimately
acquainted with every language, the dead as
well as the living. To the cultivation of let∣ters
they join that of the arts; and the me∣chanics
<PB N="31" REF="46"/>
are also permitted to occupy a place.
But their religion cannot boast of uniformity;
and their manners, like those of every other
republic, form a mixture of good and of evil:
they are sometimes enthusiastically pious, and
sometimes insanely impious.</P>
<P>The politics of this state consist rather in
words, in vague maxims and ingenious re∣flections,
than in actions, or their effects.
This people owe all their strength to the bril∣liancy
of their eloquence, and the solidity of
their arguments. Their trade is perfectly intel∣lectual,
and their riches very moderate; they
live in one continued strife for glory and for
immortality. Their dress is by no means splen∣did;
yet they affect to despise those who labour
through the impulse of avarice or necessity.</P>
<P>They are divided into many sects, and they
seem to multiply every day. The state is
shared between the Philosophers, the Physi∣cians,
the Divines, the Lawyers, the Historians,
the Mathematicians, the Orators, the Gram∣marians,
<PB N="32" REF="47"/>
and the Poets, who have each their
respective laws.</P>
<P>Justice is administered by the Critics, fre∣quently,
with more severity than justice. The
people groan under the tyranny of these go∣vernors,
particularly when they are capricious
and visionary. They rescind, they erase, or
add, at their will and pleasure, much in the
manner of the Grand Monarque—<HI>Car tel est
notre plaisir</HI>; and no author can answer for his
fate, when once he is fairly in their hands.
Some of these are so unfortunate, that, through
the cruelty of the treatment they receive, they
lose not only their temper, but their sense and
wits.</P>
<P>Shame is the great castigation of the guilty;
and to lose one's reputation, among this people,
is to lose one's life. There exist, however, but
too many impudent swindlers, who prey upon
the property of others; and many a vile spun∣ger,
who snatches the bread from the hands of
men of merit.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="48"/>
The Public are the distributors of glory;
but, too often, the distribution is made with
blindness, or undiscerning precipitation. It is
this which causes loud complaints, and excites
such murmurs throughout the republic.</P>
<P>The predominating vices of this state are
presumption, vanity, pride, jealousy, and ca∣lumny.
There is also a distemper peculiar to
the inhabitants, which is denominated <HI>hunger,</HI>
and which occasions frequent desolations
throughout the country.</P>
<P>This republic, too, has the misfortune to
be infected with numerous Plagiarists; a
species of banditti who rifle the passengers.
The corruptors of books, and the forgers, are
not less formidable; nor do there want im∣postors,
who form rhapsodies and bestow pom∣pous
titles on unimportant trifles, who levy
heavy contributions on the public.</P>
<P>There are also found an infinite number of
illustrious Idlers and Voluptuaries; who, only
seeking for those volumes that afford amusement,
draw all their subsistence from the state, without
<PB N="34" REF="49"/>
contributing any thing either to it's advantage
or it's glory. There are also Misanthropes,
born with an hatred of men: Pedants, who
are the terror of schoolboys, and the enemies
of urbanity and amiable manners.</P>
<P>I will not notice the licentious Geniuses of
the republic, who are in an eternal hostility of
sentiments, and a warfare of disputes; nor those
fastidious minds, who are too delicate not to
be offended every moment; nor those Vi∣sionaries,
who load their imagination with
crude and false systems.</P>
<P>All these may be supposed to exist in a re∣public
so vast as that of Letters; where it is
permitted to every one to reside, and to live
according to his own inclinations.</P>

<HEAD>ESDRAS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was Esdras who wrote what is at the con∣clusion
of the Books of Moses; which, as the
death of the latter is there mentioned, shews
<PB N="35" REF="50"/>
he could not have been the author. He, also,
at the return from the Babylonish captivity,
arranged into one body the Scriptures; and
many assure us, on the authority of the an∣cients,
that he corrected it in eighteen passages
which had been greatly altered and falsified. Is
there not reason to fear that he still has left so
much to correct, that the body of writings, which
pass under the name of the Holy Scriptures,
is little entitled to that sacred appellation? It's
corruptions and errors are at least evident.
Hobbes perfectly discredits Moses being the
author of the Pentateuch, in his Leviathan.
It appears that Moses delivered to Joshua some
materials, which he deposited in the ark; that
Joshua gave them to the Judges or Elders; and
that, in the course of time, they took the ar∣rangement
in which they now appear.</P>
<P>To this article we may add, that it is well
known to those who are most intelligent in
Biblical literature, that a great number of
books of the Old Testament are lost: some
have affirmed, that we are deprived of <HI>more</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="51"/>
than we possess. It is agreed, that there are
lost a book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Judah; the third Epistle to the Corinthians;
and the third Epistle of Peter. Samuel wrote
a book on the Office and Instruction of a King;
Solomon compiled a work containing three
thousand Parables, and five thousand and ninety
Songs; and some Treatises on the Nature of
Trees, Plants, and Herbs, from the Cedar to
the Hyssop; which are also lost.</P>

<HEAD>ARISTOTLE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all men of letters who have appeared,
perhaps there never was one on whom so
much praise and so much censure have been
lavished as on Aristotle: but he had this ad∣vantage,
of which some of the most eminent
scholars have been deprived, that he enjoyed
during his life a splendid reputation. Philip
of Macedon must have felt a strong con∣viction
of his merit, when he wrote to him
<PB N="37" REF="52"/>
in these terms, on the occasion of the birth of
Alexander. 'I receive from the gods, this
day, a son; but I thank them not so much
for the favour of his birth, as his having

should examine with critical acumen, and decree
with candour. The consequences are singular.
Gautier read Horace, became enamoured of his
verses, and never after quitted them: while
Brebeuf was so charmed with Lucan, that he
grew intoxicated with the Pharsalia; and, in
translating this epic, out-lucan'd Lucan him∣self
in his bombastic and tumid verses.</P>
<P>That Gautier should reject Lucan, after a
studious perusal of Horace, is not surprizing:
the wonder is, how Brebeuf could forget so
suddenly the graces and the rules of his ma∣ster,
<PB N="40" REF="55"/>
Horace, to give into Lucan's corrupted
taste.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, in his elegant Essay on the
Sublime and Beautiful, says, that 'what is
called <HI>Taste,</HI> in it's most general acceptation,
is not a simple idea, but is partly made up of
a perception of the primary pleasures of sense;
of the secondary pleasures of the imagination;
and of the conclusions of the reasoning faculty
concerning the various relations of these, and
concerning the human passions, manners, and
actions. All these are requisite to form Taste;
and the ground-work of all these is the same
in the human mind: for, as the senses are
the great originals of all our ideas, and con∣sequently
of all our pleasures, if they are not
uncertain and arbitrary, the whole ground∣work
of Taste is common to all; and, there∣fore,
there is a sufficient foundation for a con∣clusive
reasoning for these matters.'</P>
<P>In another place he observes—'<HI>Sensibility</HI>
and <HI>Judgment,</HI> which are the qualities that
<PB N="41" REF="56"/>
compose what is commonly called a <HI>Taste,</HI>
vary exceedingly in various people. From a
defect in the former of these qualities arises a
want of Taste: a weakness in the latter con∣stitutes
a wrong or a bad one.'</P>
<P>If this account is just, the sensibility and the
judgment of Brebeuf, of which the one was
so lively, and the other so vigorous, when in
his youthful days he was attached to Horace,
must have undergone a total change when he
became studiously fond of Lucan. Yet this
is not to be conceived: for it is possible to
enlarge and to strengthen our judgment; but,
surely, not to eradicate a correct one; at least,
when a man is in the vigour of life and
health.</P>

<HEAD>IMITATORS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some writers, and in general
they will be found to be pedants, who ima∣gine
they can supply by the labours of indus∣try
the deficiencies of nature. It is recorded
<PB N="42" REF="57"/>
of Paulus Manutius, that he frequently spent
a month in writing a single letter. He affected
to imitate Cicero. The consequences are, that
he has attained to something of the elegance of
his style; but he is still destitute of the native
graces of a flowing and unaffected compo∣sition.</P>
<P>May not such writers be said to create beau∣tiful
forms, without the power of bestowing
on them animation?</P>
<P>Some are very proud in the imitation of their
illustrious predecessors, but in general their abi∣lities
only reach to the imitation of their de∣fects;
as the courtiers of Alexander, who were
incapable of imitating his heroism, could mimic
his deformity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>CICERO.</HEAD>
<P>'I SHOULD,' says Menage, 'have receiv∣ed
a great pleasure to have conversed with
Cicero, had I lived in his time. He must have
<PB N="43" REF="58"/>
been a man very agreeable in conversation,
since even Caesar carefully collected his <HI>Bon
Mots.</HI> Cicero has boasted of the great actions
he has done for his country, because there is
no vanity in exulting in the performance of
our duties: but he has not boasted that he was
the most eloquent orator of his age, though he
certainly was; because nothing is more dis∣gustful
than to exult in our intellectual
powers.'</P>
<P>I must confess myself no admirer of the wit∣ticisms
of Cicero; for, in general, they are but
meagre puns, such as these—he said to a
Senator who was the son of a Taylor, '<HI>Rem
acu tetigisti.</HI>' To the son of a Cook, '<HI>Ego
quoque tibi jure favebo.</HI>'</P>

<HEAD>SOCRATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE following character of Socrates is to
be found in the Matanasiana. It deserves to
be snatched from that oblivion in which it lies
sunk.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="59"/>
Socrates, whom the Oracle of Delphos had
pronounced to be the wisest of men, inculcated
this maxim, that <HI>Science</HI> alone was <HI>Wealth,</HI>
and <HI>Ignorance, Evil.</HI> Born in the depth of
obscurity, his genius broke out like a superior
luminary amongst his fellow-citizens. He
had as many disciples as he had auditors.
Ever bold, yet moderate, chaste, patient,
and amiable, his continual application to study
had rendered every virtue familiar to him.
Yet he was so modest, that he affirmed he
knew nothing perfectly but one thing, which
was—that he was very ignorant. Such was his
consummate prudence, that he could predict
future events. It was this deep foresight into
human affairs which occasioned the Athenians
to attribute a familiar demon to him who was
careful to instruct him of the future. He en∣tertained
so sublime an idea of friendship, that,
according to him, no inheritance was so pre∣cious
as the possession of a friend. In a word,
he was so enlightened, and so resolute, that he
<PB N="45" REF="60"/>
triumphed over his natural evil inclinations, and
vanquished every opposition to virtue by his
science and his fortitude. So deep a tranquilli∣ty
had pervaded his soul, that the necessity of
swallowing poison, by the edict of the tyrants,
never disturbed his repose the evening before
it was to take place.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACES.</HEAD>
<P>A PREFACE being the porch, or the en∣trance,
to a book, should be perfectly beauti∣ful.
It is the elegance of a porch which an∣nounces
the splendor of an edifice. I have
observed, that ordinary readers skip over these
little elaborate compositions. Our fair ladies
consider them as so many pages lost, which
might better be employed in the addition of
a picturesque scene, or a tender letter to their
novels. For my part, I always gather amuse∣ment
from a Preface, be it aukwardly or skil∣fully
written; for dulness, or impertinence,
<PB N="46" REF="61"/>
may raise a laugh for a page or two, though
they become insufferable throughout a whole

<HEAD>THE ANCIENTS AND MODERNS.</HEAD>
<P>FREQUENT and violent disputes have arisen
on the subject of the preference which is to
be given to the Ancients, or the Moderns.
With the Battle of Books, by Swift, the rea∣der
is well acquainted. The controversy of
Perrault and Boileau makes a considerable
figure in French Literature; yet, surely, it
had been better if these acrid controversies had
never disgraced the Republic of Letters. The
advice of Sidonius Appollinaris is excellent:
he says, that we should read the Ancients with

<HEAD>MUTUAL PERSECUTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pagans were accustomed to accuse

which affected the Roman Empire, as Origen
remarks in his C. xxiv. on St. Matthew; St.
Cyprian, in the commencement of his book
<HI>ad Demetrianum</HI>; Tertullian, in his 40 C. of
his Apology; and Arnobius, in his first book.
When, in it's turn, Christianity became the

Empire the calamities which then happened.</P>

<HEAD>FINE THOUGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>APULEIUS calls those Neck-kerchiefs so
glassy fine, (may I so express myself?) which,
in veiling, discover the beautiful bosom of a
woman, <HI>ventum textilem</HI>; which may be trans∣lated,
<HI>woven air.</HI> It is an expression beauti∣fully
fanciful.</P>
<P>A Greek poet wrote this inscription for
a statue of Niobe—<Q>The Gods, from living, caused me to become stone.
Praxiteles, from stone, has restored me to life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="63"/>
Voiture has a fine thought in addressing
Cardinal Richelieu. How much more affect∣ing
is it to hear one's praises from the mouth
of the <HI>People,</HI> than from that of the <HI>Poets!</HI></P>
<P>Cervantes, with an elevation of sentiment,
observes, that one of the greatest advantages
which princes possess above other men, is
that of being attended by servants, as great
as themselves.</P>
<P>Buchanan has this charming thought in
one of his Elegies, to express the cruelty of
his mistress. It has the singular merit of be∣ing
a trite subject, treated in an uncommon
manner. 'She does nothing but practise
cruelties when I am in her presence; yet,
what tortures does she not feel when I am
absent! But it is not the regret of my absence,
nor the love she bears for me, which occasions
her thus to suffer: No! it is because she has
not the pleasure of beholding me suffering.'</P>
<P>Seneca, amongst many tortured sentiments
and trivial points, has frequently a happy
<PB N="49" REF="64"/>
thought. This on <HI>anger</HI> is eminently so—'I
wish,' he says, 'that the ferocity of this pas∣sion
could be spent at it's first appearance, so
that it might injure but <HI>once:</HI> as, in the case
of the Bees, whose sting is destroyed for ever
at the first puncture it occasions.'</P>
<P>Nor do these thoughts yield in felicity or
fancy.</P>
<P>Aristenetus says of a Beauty, that she seemed
most beautiful when <HI>dressed</HI>; yet appeared not
less beautiful when <HI>undressed.</HI> Of <HI>two</HI> Beauties
he says, 'they yielded to the Graces only in
<HI>number.</HI>'</P>
<P>Menage has these two terse and pointed lines
on the portrait of a lady—<Q><L>Ce portrait ressemble à la Belle;</L>
<L>Il est insensible comme elle.</L></Q>
Which a friend has thus imitated—<Q><L>In this portrait, my Fair, thy resemblance I see;</L>
<L>An insensible charmer it is—just like thee!</L></Q></P>
<P>A French poet has admirably expressed the
instantaneous sympathy of two lovers. A
<PB N="50" REF="65"/>
princess is relating to her <HI>confidante</HI> the birth
of her passion; and says—<Q><L>Et comme un jeune coeur est bientot enflammé,</L>
<L>Il me vit, il m'aima, je le vis, je l'aimai.</L></Q>
Which may be thus imitated in English; but
the Alexandrine seems here to have the advan∣tage
over the Heroic verse—<Q><L>Soon is the youthful heart by passion mov'd:</L>
<L>He saw, and lov'd me—him I saw, and lov'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>I recollect a similar passage in a Spanish play
of Calderon; but it partakes, I think, too
much of what Boileau calls '<HI>Le clinquant de
Tasse:</HI>' for it is well observed, by the same
critic, 'that nothing is beautiful which is false.'
The passage I allude to runs thus—</P>
<P>'I saw and I loved her so nearly together,
that I do not know if I saw her before I loved
her, or loved her before I saw her.'</P>
<P>It was said of Petronius, that he was <HI>pura
impuritas. Pura,</HI> because of his style; <HI>impu∣ritas,</HI>
because of his obscenities.</P>
<P><HI>Quam multa! Quam paucis!</HI> is a fine ex∣pression,
<PB N="51" REF="66"/>
which was employed to characterise a
concise style pregnant with meaning.</P>
<P>How exquisitely tender does Tasso, in one
verse, describe his Olindo! So much love, and
so much modesty, however beautiful they may
appear in poetry, the less romantic taste of the
modern fine lady may not probably admire—<Q><L>Brama assai, poco spera, nulla chiede.</L></Q><Q><L>He desires much, he hopes little, he asks nothing.</L></Q></P>
<P>Perrault has very poetically informed us,
that the ancients were ignorant of the circula∣tion
of the blood—<Q><L>—Ignoroit jusqu'aux routes certaines</L>
<L>Du meandre vivant qui coule dans les veines.</L></Q><Q><L>Unknown to them what devious course maintains</L>
<L>The living stream that flows along their veins.</L></Q></P>
<P>An Italian poet makes a lover, who has sur∣vived
his mistress, thus sweetly express him∣self—<Q><L>Piango la sua morte ela mia vita.</L></Q><Q><L>Much I deplore her death, and much my life.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="67"/>
It has been usual for poets to say, that rivers
flow to convey their tributary streams to the
sea. This figure, being a mark of subjection,
proved offensive to a patriotic Italian; and he
has ingeniously said of the River <HI>Po,</HI> because
of it's rapidity—<Q><L>Pare</L>
<L>Che porti guerra, e non tributo al mare.</L></Q>
Which may be thus imitated—<Q><L>See rapid <HI>Po</HI> to Ocean's empire bring</L>
<L>A <HI>war,</HI> and not a <HI>tribute,</HI> from his spring!</L></Q></P>
<P>I would distinguish these pastoral verses for
their elegant simplicity: they display—at least,
in the original—that amiable, light, and artless
style, which should characterise this enchanting,
though neglected, branch of poetry—<Q><L>Avec l'email de nos prairies,</L>
<L>Quand on le sçait bien faconner,</L>
<L>On peut aussi-bien couronner,</L>
<L>Qu'avec l'or et les pierreries.</L></Q></P>
<P>The following version is but a feeble attempt
to express them in our language—<PB N="53" REF="68"/>
<Q><L>Th' enamell'd flowers our meads disclose,</L>
<L>If the skill'd shepherd graceful frame,</L>
<L>A crown more precious can compose</L>
<L>Than the bright diamond's costlier flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>Perhaps this translation, produced extem∣pore
by a literary friend, in which the original
thought is almost literally preserved, and the
structure of the verse scrupulously adhered to,
is little less ingenious than the French; though
alternate rhimes, in our language, will certainly
be preferred by a correct English ear—<Q><L>With flowers th' enamell'd meads unfold,</L>
<L>By skilful hands in chaplets bound.</L>
<L>As nobly may desert be crown'd,</L>
<L>As with rich gems, and burnish'd gold.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>EARLY PRINTING.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN first the Art of Printing was disco∣vered,
they only made use of one side of a
page: they had not yet found out the expe∣dient
of impressing the other. When their
<PB N="54" REF="69"/>
editions were intended to be curious, they
omitted to print the first letter of a chapter,
for which they left a blank space, that it might
be painted or illuminated, at the option of the
purchaser. Several ancient volumes of these
early times have been found, where these letters
are wanting, as they neglected to have them
painted.</P>
<P>When the Art of Printing was first esta∣blished,
it was the glory of the learned to be
correctors of the press to the eminent printers.
Physicians, Lawyers, and Bishops themselves,
occupied this department. The printers then
added frequently to their names those of
the correctors of the press; and editions were
then valued according to the abilities of the
corrector.</P>

<HEAD>PATRONS.</HEAD>
<P>AUTHORS have too frequently received ill∣treatment
even from those to whom they dedi∣cated

Theodosius Gaza had no other recompence
for having inscribed to Sixtus the Fourth his
Translation of the book of Aristotle on the Na∣ture
of Animals, than the price of the binding,
which this charitable father of the church mu∣nificently
bestowed upon him.</P>
<P>Theocritus fills his Idyllimus with loud
complaints of the neglect of his Patrons; and
Tasso was as little successful in his Dedications.</P>
<P>Ariosto, in presenting his Orlando Furioso
to the Cardinal d'Este, was gratified with the
bitter sarcasm of—'Where the devil have you
found all this nonsense?'</P>
<P>When the French Historian, Dupleix, whose
pen was indeed fertile, presented his book to
the Duke d'Epernon, this Mecenas, turning to
the Pope's Nuncio, who was present, very
coarsely exclaimed—'Cadedis! ce Monsieur a
un fluxe enragé, il chie un livre tous les
lunes!'</P>
<P>It was Thomson, I believe, the amiable au∣thor
of the Seasons, who, having extravagantly
<PB N="56" REF="71"/>
praised a person of rank, afterwards appearing
to be undeserving of any eulogiums, very pro∣perly
employed his pen in a solemn recantation
of his error.</P>
<P>Poor Mickle, to whom we are indebted for
so beautiful a version of Camoen's Lusiad,

several good compositions.</P>
<P>Michael Cervantes composed the best and

<P>Louis the Twelfth, when he was Duke of
Orleans, being taken prisoner at the battle of

St. Aubin, was long confined in the Tower
of Bourges; and, applying himself to his stu∣dies,
which he had hitherto neglected, he be∣came
in consequence an able and enlightened
monarch.</P>
<P>Margaret, Queen of Henry the Fourth, King
of France, confined in the Louvre, pursued
very warmly the studies of elegant literature;
and composed a very skilful Apology for the
irregularities of her conduct.</P>
<P>Charles the First, during his cruel confine∣ment
at Holmsby, wrote that excellent book,
entitled, <HI>The Portrait of a King</HI>; which he
addressed to his son, and where the political
reflections will be found not unworthy of

<P>Queen Elizabeth, while confined by her sister

History of the World: of whom it is observed,
to employ the language of Hume, 'they had
leisure to reflect on the hardship, not to say the
injustice, of his sentence. They pitied his active

rigours of confinement. They were struck
with the extensive genius of the man who,
being educated amidst naval and military en∣terprizes,

<HEAD>THE POVERTY OF THE LEARNED.</HEAD>
<P>FORTUNE has rarely condescended to be the
companion of Merit. Even in these en∣lightened
times, men of letters have lived in
obscurity, while their reputation was widely
spread; and have perished in poverty, while
their works were enriching the booksellers.</P>
<P>Homer, poor and blind, resorted to the pub∣lic
places to recite his verses for a morsel of
bread.</P>
<P>The facetious poet, Plautus, gained a liveli∣hood
by assisting a miller.</P>
<P>Xylander sold his Notes on Dion Cassius

<P>Alde Manutius was so wretchedly poor, that
the expence of removing his library from
Venice to Rome made him insolvent.</P>
<P>To mention those who left nothing behind
them to satisfy the undertaker, were an end∣less
task.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="76"/>
Agrippa died in a workhouse; Cervantes is
supposed to have died with hunger; Camoens
was deprived of the necessaries of life, and is
believed to have perished in the streets.</P>
<P>The great Tasso was reduced to such a
dilemma, that he was obliged to borrow a
crown from a friend, to subsist through the
week. He alludes to his distress in a pretty
Sonnet, which he addresses to his Cat, entreat∣ing
her to assist him, during the night, with
the lustre of her eyes—<Q>Non avendo candele per iscrivere i suoi versi!</Q>
having no candle by which he could see to
write his verses!</P>
<P>The illustrious Cardinal Bentivoglio, the
ornament of Italy and of literature, languished,
in his old age, in the most distressful poverty:
and, having sold his palace to satisfy his credi∣tors,
left nothing behind him but his repu∣tation.</P>
<P>Le Sage resided in a little cottage on the
borders of Paris, and supplied the world with
<PB N="62" REF="77"/>
their most agreeable Romances; while he never
knew what it was to possess any moderate de∣gree
of comfort in pecuniary matters.</P>
<P>De Ryer, a celebrated French Poet, was
constrained to labour with rapidity, and to live
in the cottage of an obscure village. His
bookseller bought his Heroic Verses for one

<P>Purchas, who, in the reign of our First
James, had spent his life in travels and study
to form his <HI>Relation of the World</HI>; when he
gave it to the public, for the reward of his la∣bours,

sold his immortal work for ten pounds to a
bookseller, being too poor to undertake the
printing it on his own account: and Otway,
a dramatic poet in the first class, is known

<P>Samuel Boyce, whose Poem on Creation
ranks high in the scale of poetic excellence,
was absolutely famished to death; and was
found dead, in a garret, with a blanket thrown
over his shoulders, and fastened by a skewer,
with a pen in his hand!</P>
<P>Chatterton, while he supplied a variety of
monthly magazines with their chief materials,
found 'a penny tart a luxury!' and a luxury it
was, to him who could not always get bread to

fire to the library at Oxford, which was the
most curious in Europe.</P>
<P>The most violent persecution which ever the
Republic of Letters has undergone, is that of
the Caliph Omar. After having it proclaimed
throughout the kingdom, that the Alcoran
contained every thing which was useful to be∣lieve
and to know, he caused to be gathered to∣gether
whatever books could be found in his
wide realms, and distributed them to the owners
of the baths, to be used in heating their stoves;
and it is said that they employed no other ma∣terials
for this purpose during a period of six
months!</P>
<P>At the death of the learned Peiresc, a cham∣ber

who inherited his estates, that, although re∣peatedly
entreated to permit them to be pub∣lished,
she preferred employing them to other
purposes; and it was her singular pleasure to
regale herself occasionally with burning these
learned epistles, to save the expence of fire∣ing!</P>

professors in rhetoric frequently gave their
scholars the life of some saint for a trial of their
talent at <HI>amplification.</HI> The students, being
constantly at a loss to furnish out their pages,
invented these wonderful adventures. The
good fathers of that age, whose simplicity was
not inferior to their devotion, were so delighted
with these flowers of rhetoric, that they were
induced to make a collection of these mira∣culous
compositions; not imagining that, at
some distant period of time, they would be∣come
matters of faith. Yet, when James de
Voraigne, (Vicar-general of the Jacobins)
Peter Nadal, and Peter Ribadeneira, wrote the
Lives of the Saints, they sought for their ma∣terials
in the libraries of the monasteries; and,
awakening from the dust these manuscripts of
amplification, imagined they made an inva∣luable
present to the world by laying before
them these bulky absurdities. The people re∣ceived
them with all imaginable simplicity,
and, in the last century, it was dangerous
<PB N="69" REF="84"/>
for a man to dare even to suspect the reality
of these pious fictions. We are indebted to
Tillemont, to Fleury, Baillet, Launoi, and
Bollandus, for having cleared much of this
rubbish; and, rejecting what was false, by an
enlightened criticism, have made that probable,
which before was doubtful.</P>
<P>' What has been called <HI>The Golden Legend,</HI>
which is the compilation of the above Vo∣raigne'
observes Patin, 'is a book replete with
the most ridiculous and silly histories ima∣ginable'.
Melchior Canus, who was a learned
Dominican, greatly disapproves of this legend;
and had said, that 'it is a narrative at once un∣worthy
of the Saints, and every honest Chris∣tian.
I do not know why it should be called
<HI>golden,</HI> composed as it is by a man who had a
mouth of <HI>iron,</HI> and a heart of <HI>lead.</HI>'</P>
<P>It will, probably, be agreeable to the reader,
to inspect a specimen of these legends. To
gratify his curiosity, I have selected the follow∣ing;
and, that he may not complain of the
<PB N="70" REF="85"/>
tedious length of this article, it shall not be
given to him in the heavy style of James de
Voraigne, or of myself, but embellished by the
luminous diction of Mr. Gibbon—</P>
<P>' Among the insipid legends of Ecclesiastical
History, I am tempted to distinguish the me∣morable
fable of <HI>The Seven Sleepers</HI>; whose
imaginary date corresponds with the reign of
the younger Theodosius, and the conquest of
Africa by the Vandals. When the Emperor
Decius persecuted the Christians, seven noble
youths of Ephesus concealed themselves in a
spacious cavern, on the side of an adjacent
mountain; where they were doomed to perish
by the tyrant, who gave orders that the en∣trance
should be firmly secured with a pile of
stones. They immediately fell into a deep
slumber, which was miraculously prolonged,
without injuring the powers of life, during a
period of one hundred and eighty-seven years.
At the end of that time, the slaves of Adolius,
to whom the inheritance of the mountain had
<PB N="71" REF="86"/>
descended, removed the stones, to supply ma∣terials
for some rustic edifice. The light of the
sun darted into the cavern, and the Seven
Sleepers were permitted to awake. After a
slumber, as they thought, of a few hours, they
were pressed by the calls of hunger; and re∣solved
that Jamblichus, one of their number,
should secretly return to the city, to purchase
bread for the use of his companions. The
youth—if we may still employ that appel∣lation—could no longer recognize the once
familiar aspect of his native country; and his
surprize was increased by the appearance of a
large cross, triumphantly erected over the prin∣cipal
gate of Ephesus. His singular dress and
obsolete language confounded the baker, to
whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius,
as the current coin of the empire; and Jam∣blichus,
on the suspicion of a secret treasure,
was dragged before the judge. Their mutual
enquiries produced the amazing discovery, that
two centuries were almost elapsed since Jam∣blichus
<PB N="72" REF="87"/>
and his friends had escaped from the
rage of a Pagan tyrant. The Bishop of Ephe∣sus,
the Clergy, the Magistrates, the people,
and, it is said, the Emperor Theodosius himself,
hastened to visit the cavern of the Seven
Sleepers; who bestowed their benediction, re∣lated
their story, and at the same instant peace∣ably
expired.</P>
<P>' This popular tale,' Mr. Gibbon adds,
'Mahomet learned when he drove his camels
to the fairs of Syria; and he has introduced it,
as a <HI>divine revelation,</HI> into the Koran.'—The
same story has been adopted and adorned
by the nations, from Bengal to Africa, who
profess the Mahometan religion.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE FAIR-SEX HAVING NO SOULS.</HEAD>
<P>A SPANISH author has affirmed, that <HI>brutes</HI>
have no souls; a French writer supports the
same opinion; but an Italian, more bold, has
ventured to maintain that the <HI>fair-sex</HI> have
<PB N="73" REF="88"/>
likewise no souls, and are of another species of
animal to man. This the author shews by va∣rious
proofs drawn from the Scriptures, which
he explains according to his own fancy. While
this book was published in Latin, the Inquisi∣tion
remained silent but, when it was trans∣lated
into the vulgar tongue, they censured and
prohibited it. The Italian ladies were divided,
on this occasion, into two opposite parties: the
one was greatly enraged to be made so inferior
to the other sex; and the other, considering
themselves only as <HI>machines,</HI> were content to
amuse themselves in playing off the springs in
the manner most agreeable to themselves.</P>
<P>The Author of the Commentary on the
Epistles of St. Paul, falsely ascribed to St. Am∣brose,
says, on the eleventh chapter of the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, that <HI>women</HI> are not
made according to the image of the Creator.</P>
<P>The Mahometans are known to hold the
same opinions concerning the souls of the
female sex, and likewise the Jews. Very un∣gallantly,
<PB N="74" REF="89"/>
each Jew, among his morning bene∣dictions,
includes one, <HI>to thank God he has not
made him a woman.</HI></P>
<P>I must confess, it is a difficult task to resolve if—<Q><L>This Novelty on earth, this fair defect</L>
<L>Of Nature—</L><BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q>

are deprived of souls:
<Q><L>For 'tis in vain to think to guess</L>
<L>At Women by <HI>appearances</HI>;</L>
<L>That paint and patch their imperfections</L>
<L>Of intellectual complexions;</L>
<L>And daub their tempers o'er with washes,</L>
<L>As artificial as their faces.</L><BIBL>HUDIBRAS.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Let us, however, conclude that, if they are
not themselves in possession of a <HI>soul,</HI> they not
infrequently seem to infuse one into the most
unanimated of men. It is their white hand
that distributes with peculiar grace the laurels
of the Poet and the Hero. Through all classes
of mankind their power is alike displayed:
the smiles of his <HI>Nancy</HI> animate the <HI>Sailor</HI> and
the <HI>Soldier,</HI> as well as those of <HI>Laura</HI> and
<PB N="75" REF="90"/>
<HI>Geraldine</HI> the <HI>Bard</HI> and the <HI>Hero:</HI> and, to
finish by another quotation, let us acknowledge,

<HEAD>POETS, PHILOSOPHERS, AND ARTISTS,
MADE BY ACCIDENT.</HEAD>
<P>ACCIDENT has frequently occasioned the
most eminent geniuses to display their powers.
Father Mallebranche will serve for an example.
Having compleated his studies in Philosophy
and Theology, without any other intention
than devoting himself to some religious order,
he little expected to become of such celebrity
as his works have made him. Loitering, in
an idle hour, in the shop of a bookseller, in
turning over a parcel of books, <HI>L'Homme de
Descartes</HI> fell into his hands. Having dipt
into some parts, he was induced to peruse the
whole. It was this circumstance that produced
<PB N="76" REF="91"/>
those profound contemplations which gave birth,
to so many beautiful compositions in Physics,
Metaphysics, and Morality, which have made
him pass for the Plato of his age.</P>
<P>Cowley became a Poet by accident. In his
mother's apartment he found, when very young,
Spenser's Fairy Queen; and, by a continual
study of Poetry, he became so enchanted of the
Muse, that he grew irrecoverably a Poet.</P>
<P>Dr. Johnson informs, us, that 'the great
Painter of the present age had the first fondness
for his art excited by the perusal of Richard∣son's
Treatise.'</P>

<HEAD>PHYSICIANS WRITE LITTLE ON PROFES∣SIONAL

<P>IT is remarkable that, of all men of letters
who attach themselves to any profession, none
so willingly quit their occupations to write on

<P>Julius Scaliger, who was a Doctor in Physic,
has written much Criticism.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="92"/>
Viguier has compiled several bulky volumes
of Natural History.</P>
<P>Averroes, the Arabian Physician, has trans∣lated

<P>Ficinnius has given a Latin version of Plato,

<P>The great Cardan has written on a variety
of subjects, all very foreign to the studies of
Medicine.</P>
<P>Paul Jovius has composed numerous Histories.</P>
<P>Sorbiere, a Physician well known in France,
has translated the Utopia of our Sir Thomas
More, and other very curious works.</P>
<P>Spons, a Physician at Lyons, has written his
Voyages, and some Treatises, which display a
great depth of erudition.</P>
<P>The two Patins have written nothing con∣cerning
Medicine, but much in Polite Li∣terature.</P>
<P>Perrault, the antagonist of Boileau, translated
Vitruvius, and gave public Lectures on Geo∣metry
and Architecture.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="93"/>
Dr. Smollet had more frequently his pen,
than the pulse of a patient, in his hand.</P>
<P>Akenside and Armstrong are celebrated for
their Poetry; and the late Dr. Gregory, of
Edinburgh, has published several pleasing com∣positions
in prose.</P>
<P>Dr. Moore and Dr. Berkenhout are living
authors, whose pens have written—if I may
say it without offence—what is more valuable
than their prescriptions.</P>
<P>Why Physicians write so little on professional

<HEAD>AMUSEMENTS OF MEN OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>MEN of letters, for a relaxation from literary
fatigue—a fatigue which is more unsufferable
than that which proceeds from the labours of
the mechanic—form amusements, sometimes,
<PB N="79" REF="94"/>
according to their professional character; but,
more frequently, according to their whim.</P>
<P>Tycho Brahe diverted himself with polishing
glasses for all kinds of spectacles, and making
mathematical instruments.</P>
<P>D'Andilly, the Translator of Josephus, one
of the most learned men of his age, cultivated
trees; Barclay, in his leisure hours, was a
florist; Balzac amused himself with making
pastils; Peiresc found his amusement amongst
his medals and antiquarian curiosities; the
Abbé de Maroles with his engravings; and
Politian in singing airs to his lute.</P>
<P>Rohault wandered from shop to shop, to ob∣serve
the mechanics labour.</P>
<P>The great Arnauld read, in his hours of re∣laxation,
any amusing romance that fell into
his hands. This also did the critical War∣burton.</P>
<P>Galileo read Ariosto; and Christina, Queen
of Sweden, Martial.</P>
<P>Guy Patin wrote letters to his friends: an
<PB N="80" REF="95"/>
usual relaxation amongst men of letters, and
very agreeable to their correspondents, when
they are worth the postage.</P>
<P>Others have found amusement in composing
treatises on odd subjects. Seneca wrote a Bur∣lesque
Narrative on Claudian's Death. Pierrius
has written an Eulogium on Beards.</P>
<P>Virgil sported prettily with a gnat; Homer
with frogs and mice.</P>
<P>Holstein has written an Eulogium on the
North Wind; Heinsius, on the Ass; Menage,
the Transmigration of the Parasitical Pedant to
a Parrot; and also the Petition of the Dic∣tionaries.</P>
<P>Erasmus has composed—I think it was to
amuse himself when travelling in a post∣chaise—his Panegyric on Morus, or Folly;
which, authorized by the pun, he dedicated to
Sir Thomas More.</P>
<P>Montaigne found a very agreeable play-mate
in his cat.</P>
<P>Cardinal de Richelieu, amongst all his great
<PB N="81" REF="96"/>
occupations, found a recreation in violent exer∣cises;
and he was once discovered jumping
with his servant, to try who could reach the
highest side of a wall. De Crammont, ob∣serving
the Cardinal to be jealous of his powers
in this respect, offered to jump with him; and,
in the true spirit of a courtier, having made
some efforts which nearly reached the Car∣dinal's,
confessed he was surpassed by him.
This was jumping like a politician; and it
was by this means, it is said, he ingratiated
himself with the minister.</P>
<P>Dr. Campbell was alike fond of robust exer∣cise;
and the scholar has been found leaping
over tables and chairs.</P>
<P>What ridiculous amusements passed between
Dean Swift and his friends in Ireland, his dis∣cerning
Editors have kindly revealed to the
public. We are astonished to see a great mind
suffering itself to be levelled to trifles which
even our very Magazines consider as disgraceful
to <HI>their</HI> pages!</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="97"/>
The life of Shenstone was passed in an
amusement which was to him an eternal source
of disappointment and anguish. His favourite
<HI>ferme ornée,</HI> while it displayed all the taste and
elegancies of the poet, displayed also his cha∣racteristic
poverty. His feeling mind was
often pained by those invidious comparisons
which the vulgar were perpetually making
with the stately scenes of Hagley's neighbour∣ing
magnificence.</P>
<P>If Dr. Johnson suffered his great mind to
descend into trivial amusement, it was—to
borrow the image of a friend—like the ele∣phant,
who sometimes gives a shock to armies,
and sometimes permits himself to be led by a
naked infant.</P>

<HEAD>THE BELLES LETTRES.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to be the fate of the Belles Lettres,
an ingenious French writer observes, that they
break out in all their splendour during some
<PB N="83" REF="98"/>
ages, and then are again doomed to decline into
total neglect.</P>
<P>Athens long preserved a correct taste in Elo∣quence,
in Philosophy, and in Poetry. At the
same time, the Fine Arts flourished in all their
beauty; but a frightful barbarism soon suc∣ceeded
the refinement and the science of this
ingenious nation.</P>
<P>The Romans, having vanquished the Greeks,
awakened the Muses from their lethargy; and
the Augustan Age was for Italy what that
of Pisistratus had been for Greece. The de∣cline
of that empire soon occasioned that of
the Belles Lettres; and the invasions of those
people who dismembered the Roman Empire
threw all again into barbarism and ignorance.
Charlemagne attempted to revive the sciences:
he rewarded the learned; and he established
schools in the principal cities of the Empire.
It was his command, that a number of volumes
should be transcribed, to be dispersed through∣out
the kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="99"/>
Our illustrious Alfred began the same refor∣mation
in England. Engaged as he was in
one continued war with the Danes, nothing
could disturb the designs he had formed for
the restoration of letters. He laments the
ignorance of the times with all the indignation
of the philosopher, and the resentment of a
patriot prince.</P>
<P>The attempts of these great monarchs availed
little: the clash of arms taught a melancholy
silence to the Muses. Since those times, as the
monarchical government became more firmly
established, the Belles Lettres insensibly re∣vived.</P>
<P>But it was chiefly under the pontificate of
Leo the Tenth, that munificent patron of lite∣rature,
that they sprung up in all their richest
luxuriance. Assisted by the art of printing,
which had been discovered some time before,
they made those immense progresses, and
formed those heroes of literature, which so
forcibly claim our warmest admiration.</P>

<HEAD>ON TEACHING THE CLASSICS.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE, says Marville, who undertake the
instruction of youth, and who read the an∣cients
with their scholars, should point out to
their observation the characteristic <HI>trait</HI> of each
of these authors. This manner of teaching
might inspire them to emulate these perfect
models of composition.</P>
<P>Xenophon, for instance, and Quintilian,
are excellent to form the education of young
scholars.</P>
<P>Plato will fill the mind with great notions,
and elevate them into a contemplation of the
sublimest metaphysics.</P>
<P>Aristotle will instruct them acutely to analyse
the principle of composition, and to decide on
the beauties of the works of imagination.</P>
<P>Cicero will shew them how to speak and to
write with grace: Seneca, to philosophise.</P>
<P>The Elder Pliny opens the mind to a great
<PB N="86" REF="101"/>
diversity of knowledge. Aesop and Phaedrus,
in an amusive way, will form their manners.</P>
<P>Epictetus, and the Emperor Antoninus, will
afford them advice and counsels in every station
of human life.</P>
<P>Plutarch offers the noblest examples of an∣tiquity,
and furnishes excellent matter for attic
conversations.</P>
<P>Homer displays man in every possible situ∣ation,
and paints him always great.</P>
<P>Virgil inculcates piety towards the gods, and
filial tenderness towards our parents.</P>
<P>In Sallust, the portraits of the great may be
contemplated; in Plautus and Terence, those
of individuals; in Horace, and the Younger
Pliny, the delicate eulogiums which may be
administered to kings.</P>
<P>But, before these great models are offered to
the study of our youth, as they claim a maturity
of judgment, let them first be initiated by some
elementary works.</P>

<P>A gentleman did nearly the same thing, but

<PB N="88" REF="103"/>
put into the <HI>errata,</HI> instead of <HI>Chienne de

<P>THE <HI>Notes Variorum</HI> were, originally, but a
compilation of notes drawn from those nume∣rous

or had explained them in other works.
The first collections were very indifferent, their
selectors possessing no powers of discrimination.
Frequently, they have chosen the worst: they
bring no proofs from the authors whom they
have abridged; and they are continually maim∣ing
their ideas. To make their collections
bulky, they have written as much on the clear
as on the obscure passages, and have swelled
them with very frivolous digressions.</P>
<P>The later editions of the <HI>Notes Variorum</HI>
have been made by more able compilers. As
they are so much the more preferable to the

undertaken under the conduct of Messieurs
<PB N="93" REF="108"/>
De Montausier, Bossuet, and Huet. To a cor∣rect
text, they have added a clear and concise
paraphrase of the text, with notes. The dis∣similarity
of the genius, and the peculiar cha∣racters,
of all these authors, have been one
great cause that they have not all been
treated with the same ability, and with equal
felicity: but still, it must be allowed, they form
the most beautiful body in literature that the
public has ever been gratified with.</P>
<P>Another critic presents us with a more satis∣factory
account of this celebrated edition of the
Classics. The greater part of these interpre∣ters
have but indifferently executed their em∣ployment:
they have followed, in their text,
the inferiour editions, instead of making use of
the best; and they have left in the notes those
same faults which were so much censured in
the Dutch editions, with the Notes Variorum.
There is, however, one thing valuable in the
Paris editions—a Verbal Index, by which any
passage may be found on recollecting a few
<PB N="94" REF="109"/>
words. However, it must be confessed, the
munificent patronage of a great monarch has
not produced the adequate effects. The pro∣ject
was excellent, but the performance was
bad.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this article without ob∣serving
what benefits the student derives from
<HI>Verbal Indexes.</HI> He not only saves a great ex∣pence
of time, which is squandered in the ex∣amination
for passages; but he may more easily
trace the imitations of others, when they hap∣pen
to catch the words of the original. I have
received such services from Newton's edition
of Milton, which is enriched with a Verbal
Index, that I cannot recollect them without
gratitude. If a Verbal Index was formed to
Johnson's edition of the Poets, it would <HI>then</HI>
become invaluable; and I am sure there are

of magnitude. But, in those times, the nation
was little addicted to the cultivation of letters:
the writers were then few, and the readers were
not many. When, at length, a taste for lite∣rature
spread itself through the body of the
people, vanity induced the inexperienced and
<PB N="96" REF="111"/>
the ignorant to aspire to literary honours. To
oppose these inroads into the haunts of the
Muses, Periodical Criticism brandished it's
formidable weapon; and it was by the fall of
others that our greatest geniuses have been
taught to rise. Multifarious writings produced
multifarious strictures; and if the rays of cri∣ticism
were not always of the strongest kind,
yet so many continually issuing, formed
a focus, which has enlightened those whose
occupations had otherwise never permitted
them to judge on literary compositions.</P>
<P>The origin of so many Literary Journals
takes it's birth in France. Denis de Sallo,
Ecclesiastical Counsellor in the Parliament of
Paris, invented the scheme of a work of this
kind. On the 30th of May 1665, appeared
the first number of his <HI>Journal des Sçavans.</HI>'
What is remarkable, he published his Essay in
the name of the Sieur de Hédouville, who was
his <HI>footman.</HI> One is led to suppose, by this
circumstance, that he entertained but a faint
<PB N="97" REF="112"/>
hope of it's success; or, perhaps, he thought
that the scurrility of criticism might be sanc∣tioned
by it's supposed author. The work,
however, met with so favourable a reception,
that Sallo had the satisfaction of seeing it, in
the next year, imitated throughout Europe;
and his Journal, at the same time, translated
into various languages. But, as most authors
lay themselves too open to the severe critic, the
animadversions of Sallo were given with such
malignity of wit and asperity of criticism, that
the Journal excited loud murmurs, and the
most heart-moving complaints possible. Sallo,
after having published only his third Journal,
felt the irritated wasps of literature thronging
so thick about him, that he very gladly abdi∣cated
the throne of Criticism.</P>
<P>The reign of his successor, Abbé Galloys—intimidated by the fate of Sallo—was of a milder
kind. He contented himself with only giving
the titles of books, accompanied with extracts.
Such a conduct was not offensive to their au∣thors,
<PB N="98" REF="113"/>
and yet was not unuseful to the public.
I do not, however, mean to favour the idea,
that this simple manner of noticing books is
equal to sound and candid criticism.</P>
<P>On the model of the <HI>Journal des Sçavans</HI>
were formed our <HI>Philosophical Transactions</HI>;
with this difference, however, that they only
notice objects of science, such as Physics and
Mathematics The Journal of Leipsic, entitled
<HI>Acta Eruditorum,</HI> appeared in 1682, under the
conduct of the erudite <HI>Menkenius,</HI> Professor
in the University of that city. The famous
<HI>Bayle</HI> undertook, for Holland, a similar work,
in 1684; and his <HI>Nouvelles de la Republique de
Lettres</HI> appeared the first of May in that year.
This new Journal was every where well re∣ceived;
and deserved to be so, for never were
criticisms given with greater force. He pos∣sessed
the art of comprizing, in short extracts,
the justest notion of a book, without adding
any thing irrelevant or impertinent. Bayle
discontinued this work in 1687, after having
<PB N="99" REF="114"/>
given thirty-six volumes in 12mo. Others
continued it to 1710, when it was finally
closed.</P>
<P>A Mr. de la Roche formed an English
Journal, entitled <HI>Memoirs of Literature,</HI> about
the commencement of this century, which is
well spoken of in the Bibliotheque Raisonnée.
It was afterwards continued by Mr. Reid,
under the title of <HI>The Present State of the Re∣public
of Letters.</HI> He succeeded very well;
but, being obliged to make a voyage to China,
it interrupted his useful labours. He was suc∣ceeded
by Messieurs Campbell and Webster;
but the last, for reasons of which I am ignorant,
being dismissed, it was again resumed by Mr.
Campbell. This <HI>Journal</HI> does by no means
rival our modern <HI>Reviews.</HI> I do not perceive
that the criticism is more valuable; and cer∣tainly
the entertainment is inferior. Our
elder Journals seem only to notice a few of the
best publications; and this not with great ani∣mation
of sentiment, or elegance of diction.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="115"/>
Of our modern Journals it becomes me to
speak with caution. It is not treading on <HI>ashes</HI>
still glowing with latent fire, as Horace ex∣presses
it, but it is rushing through consuming
<HI>flames.</HI> Let it be sufficient, that from their
pages I acknowledge to have acquired a rich
fund of critical observation; and, if I have
been animated by their eulogiums, I ascribe
this honour, not so much to the confined abi∣lities
Nature has bestowed on me, as to their
strictures, which have taught me something of
the delicacy of Taste, and something of the
ardour of Genius.</P>

<HEAD>GUY PATIN.</HEAD>
<P>GUY PATIN was an author who made much
noise in his time: but, like many others of
this kind, Posterity, more temperate, as less
interested in the scandal of the day, will not
allow pertness to be <HI>wit,</HI> and multifarious anec∣dote,
<PB N="101" REF="116"/>
<HI>learning.</HI> We, as Englishmen, must pe∣culiarly
feel our indignation kindle at the
strictures which I shall notice; and which,
garbage as they are, have been hashed up by
D'Argens, Voltaire, and many a French lite∣rary
<HI>Cuisinier.</HI></P>
<P>The work, for which he gained so much un∣merited
applause, consists of three volumes of
letters, which were written to his friends in a
familiar style, replete with the anecdotes of
the day—a kind of newspaper, rather than an
epistolary correspondence; and, like a news∣paper,
since time has commented on it's text,
it will be found that the greater part of these
anecdotes is false and malicious. They were
read, however, with great avidity: but this
criticism of Menage will be found to be
just—</P>
<P>' The Letters of Guy Patin are replete with
falshoods. Mr. Bigot and I have detected
some in every page. He was not careful in
<PB N="102" REF="117"/>
what he wrote, and he took every thing as it
came.'</P>
<P>' These Letters,' says Voltaire, 'were read
eagerly, because they contained anecdotes of
such things as every body likes, and satires
which are liked still more. They shew what
uncertain guides in History those writers are,
who inconsiderately set down the news of the
day. Such accounts are frequently false, or
perverted by the malice of mankind.'</P>
<P>Bayle, in criticising them, observes—'It is
proper the Reader should know all the witty
sayings and stories he relates are not true.
There are some places, wherein he shews <HI>a
terrible malice,</HI> and <HI>a prodigious boldness,</HI> in giv∣ing
a criminal turn to every thing.'</P>
<P>This language is indeed forcible; it is cer∣tainly
just. The Reader may judge by the ex∣tract
I now make out of the Patiniana, Page
17. It was written when Salmasius finished
his Defence of King Charles, which was so ner∣vously
answered by Milton.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="118"/>
' The book of Mr. Salmasius, written for the
defence of the King of England, is now print∣ing
at Leyden, in French, and in Latin. This
apology for a king, who has been beheaded by
his people, is a delicate subject, and will not
please every body. The <HI>English,</HI> who are the
<HI>worst,</HI> the <HI>most</HI> cruel, and the <HI>most</HI> perfidious
of people, pretend that they are countenanced
by their Religion, and the political Law; but
<HI>Religio non fert Parricidas, Ecclesia nescit San∣guinem.</HI>
The most refined politics do not go
so far as <HI>to dare</HI> to punish kings, like other
malefactors, by the hand of the common
hangman. The grandfather of this Monarch
was strangled by the Puritans of Scotland. His
grandmother, Mary Stuart, was beheaded in
England, in the year 1587, by the command
of Queen Elizabeth. I, who <HI>naturally</HI> hate the
English, cannot but shudder with horror
when I think of this nation.'</P>
<P>I shall say nothing on this extraordinary
passage; but only remark that, though all this
<PB N="104" REF="119"/>
passed so near the times in which Patin lived,
he has committed, in this short extract, a gross
historical blunder.</P>
<P>It has been a custom to echo amongst the
Gallic writers, that the English nation are of
the race
<Q><L>—of the Cannibals that each other eat,</L>
<L>The Anthropophagi—</L></Q></P>
<P>The very executions of our malefactors at
Tyburn have been urged as a proof. Hear
Voltaire—</P>
<P>' There have been sanguinary times in all
nations; but, amongst the <HI>English,</HI> more illus∣trious
men have been brought to the block
than <HI>in all Europe</HI> besides. It was the cha∣racter
of this nation to commit legal murders.
The Gates of London have been infected with
human heads fixed to the walls.'</P>
<P>D'Argens, in his Philosophical Visions, has
given the character of the English nations, un∣der
the names of the Libertines, in the second
Vision. The passage is too long to be quoted;
<PB N="105" REF="120"/>
but the power of his pencil seems not inferior
to that of the lively Voltaire's, in drawing our
Portrait with a vermilion hue. 'Monsters!'
as Shakespeare says,
<Q><L>—whose heads</L>
<L>Do grow beneath their shoulders!—</L></Q></P>
<P>He says, that a civil war is our delight, and
the beheading a Monarch our amusement.
This hardly deserves the name of Wit; it is
certainly destitute of Truth. I have not infre∣quently
thought, that these lively and facetious
writers (for surely they did not mean to be
<HI>serious</HI>) are ignorant of their own history; no
improbable circumstance with those who pro∣bably
have <HI>written</HI> nearly as many books as they
have <HI>read.</HI> I maintain, that <HI>France</HI> has known
more sanguinary periods than England; and
that <HI>more</HI> of their Kings than of our own have
come to an untimely end. Let us recollect
the Assassinations of Henry the Third and
Fourth; the Reigns of Henry the Second and
Charles the Fourth; Louis the Thirteenth and
<PB N="106" REF="121"/>
Fourteenth; and let all the efforts of all the
<HI>Patins</HI> produce a massacre in <HI>England</HI> so dread∣ful
as that of St. Bartholomew in <HI>France!</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>THE TALMUD AND GEMARA.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Talmud</HI> is a collection of Jewish Tra∣ditions,
which had been orally preserved. It
comprizes the <HI>Mishna,</HI> which is the text; and
the <HI>Gemara,</HI> it's commentary. It is a compleat
system of the barbarous learning of the Jews.
They have persuaded themselves, that these tra∣ditional
explications are of a Divine origin: for
they tell us, that the Pentateuch was written
out by their Legislator before his death; that the
number of Copies was thirteen, one for each
tribe, and the remaining one was deposited in
the Ark. That the Oral Law, 'was what
Moses continually taught, in his Sanhedrim, to
the Elders, and the rest of the people;' the mode
of which honest David Levi informs us was
thus—</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="122"/>
' As soon as <HI>Moses</HI> was returned to his tent
from receiving the words of God, he called
<HI>Aaron</HI> thither unto him, and first delivered
unto him the <HI>Text,</HI> which was to be the Writ∣ten
Law; and after that, the interpretation of it,
which was the <HI>Oral Law,</HI> in the same order
as he received <HI>both</HI> from <HI>God</HI> in the Mount.
Then Aaron arising, and seating himself at the
right-hand of Moses, Eleazar, and Ithamar, his
sons, went in the next; and being taught both
these Laws at the feet of the Prophet, in the
same manner as Aaron had been, they also
arose and seated themselves; and then the
Seventy Elders, who constituted the Sanhedrim,
or Great Senate of the nation; and then enter∣ed
all such of the people as were desirous of
knowing the word of God.'</P>
<P>He then informs us that Moses, Aaron, his
sons, and the Elders, made the same repetition
before they withdrew—'So that the people
having heard <HI>both</HI> these Laws repeated to them
four times, they all had it thereby firmly fixed
<PB N="108" REF="123"/>
in their memories; but the interpretation thereof
was to be delivered down, <HI>only by word of
mouth,</HI> to the succeeding generations,' for which
no reason is alledged.</P>
<P>It appears afterwards, that at the end of the
40th year of their flight from Egypt, the me∣mory
of the people became treacherous, and
Moses was constrained to repeat, every now and
then, this same <HI>Oral Law</HI>; which (if it is not
profane to say) had been much better <HI>written</HI>
as the Pentateuch was.</P>
<P>This history some may be inclined to sup∣pose
to be apocryphal. It appears that the
Talmud was compiled by certain Jewish doc∣tors,
who were solicited for this purpose by
their nation, that they might have something
to oppose to their Christian adversaries. These
doctors were descendants of the Ten Tribes of
Israel, who were led into captivity by king Sal∣manazar,
father of Sennacherib, in the reign
of King Hosea. This book is a mixture of the
Syriac, the Hebrew, and the vulgar Hebrew,
<PB N="109" REF="124"/>
which was the language spoken in the schools
of the Rabbins, and which differs as much from
the other, as the Latin of Bartolinus from that
of Cicero. This work contains nothing that is
valuable, but a very heavy load of pious absur∣dities,
of insipid stories and palpable contradic∣tions.
The only apology that has been made
for these extravagancies and idle fictions, is,
that after the completion of the Talmud, those
who succeeded in the Schools are distinguished
by the name of <HI>Opinionists,</HI> and not by that of
<HI>Doctors</HI>; and that no Jew is compelled to receive
them as matters of faith, although we are in∣formed
that this work originated (as we have
already observed) from the Great Dictator of
the Written Law.</P>
<P>As the Reader may be curious to know one of
these Rabbinical Reveries, we have compiled
some notices which they have given concern∣ing
<HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>Adam's <HI>body</HI> was made of the earth of Ba∣bylon,
his <HI>head</HI> of the land of Israel, his <HI>other</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="125"/><HI>members</HI> of other parts of the world. R. Meir
thought he was compact of the earth gathered
out of the whole earth; as it is written—<HI>Thine
eyes did see my substance.</HI> Now it is elsewhere writ∣ten—<HI>The eyes of the Lord are over all the earth.</HI>
R. Aha expressly marks the twelve hours
in which his various parts were formed. His
stature was from one end of the world to the
other; and it was for his transgression that the
Creator, laying his hand in anger on him,
lessened him; for before, (says R. Eleazar)
'with his hand he reached the firmament.'
R. Jehuda thinks his sin was Heresy; but R.
Isaac thinks (as my author expresses it) that
'it was nourishing his foreskin.'</P>
<P>They farther inform us, that he was an
Hermaphrodite, having both sexes, and a
double body; the female parts joined at the
shoulders, and back parts to the male; their
countenances turned from each other. And
this they prove by Moses saying, '<HI>So God
created man in his image; male and female</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="126"/>
<HI>created he them, and he called their name</HI> ADAM.'
Adam, being solitary, cut himself in two, (a
hint this to the Managers for their Panto∣mimes)
and found himself fitted for pro∣creation.
Leo Hebraeus thus reconciles the
fable of Plato's <HI>Audrogynus</HI> with the narra∣tion
of Moses, from which he thinks it is
borrowed. Plato relates, that Jupiter, in the
first forming of mankind, made them such
<HI>audrogini,</HI> with two bodies, of two sexes joined
in the breast, which he divided for their pride,
the navel still remaining as a <HI>scar</HI> of the
wound then made.</P>
<P>This article may be sufficient to satiate
the Reader with a perusal of the Talmud.
For his farther satisfaction, I refer him to
<HI>Basnage's Histoire des Juifs, tome</HI> IV. p.

<HEAD>CARDINAL RICHELIEU.</HEAD>
<P>THE present anecdote concerning Cardinal
Richelieu may serve to teach the man of let∣ters,
<PB N="112" REF="127"/>
how he deals out Criticism to the <HI>Great,</HI>
when they ask his opinion of Manuscripts, be
they in verse or prose.</P>
<P>The Cardinal placed in a gallery of his
Palace the portraits of several illustrious men.
Among them was Blaise de Montluc, Mareschal
of France. He was desirous of composing
the inscriptions which were to be placed
round the portraits. That which he intend∣ed
for Montluc, was conceived in these terms:
<HI>Multa fecit, Plura scripsit, Vir tamen, Magnus
fuit.</HI> He shewed it to Bourbon, the Royal
Professor in Greek, and asked his opinion
concerning it. Having read it, he expressed
his dislike in warm terms, and thought it was
Latin much in the style of the Breviary; and,
if it had concluded with an <HI>Allelujah,</HI> it would
serve for an <HI>Anthem</HI> to the <HI>Magnificat.</HI> The
Cardinal agreed with the severity of his stric∣tures;
and even acknowledged the discernment
of the Professor; 'for,' he said, 'it is really writ∣ten
by a Priest.' But, however he might ap∣prove
<PB N="113" REF="128"/>
of Bourbon's critical power, he punish∣ed
without mercy his ingenuity. The pension
his Majesty had bestowed on him was withheld
the next year.</P>
<P>The Cardinal was one of those ambitious
men who foolishly aspire to excel in whatever
a true Genius is most excellent; and, because he
saw himsef constantly disappointed, he envied,
with all the venom of rancour, those talents
which are so frequently <HI>all</HI> that men of genius
possess.</P>
<P>Here are two interesting anecdotes—He
was jealous of Balzac, because his reputa∣tion
became so splendid: he even offered the
elder Heinsius ten thousand crowns to write
a Criticism which should ridicule his elaborate
compositions. This Heinsius refused, because
Salmasius threatened to revenge Balzac on his
<HI>Herodes Infanticida.</HI></P>
<P>He attempted to rival the reputation of Cor∣neille's
Cid, by opposing to it one of the most
ridiculous productions that was ever exhibited
<PB N="114" REF="129"/>
in the theatre. It was an allegorical Tragedy,
in which the <HI>Minister</HI> had congregated the four
quarters of the world: it was distinguished
by the name of <HI>Europe</HI>; and a great deal of
political matter was thrown together, and di∣vided
into scenes and acts. When he first sent
it anonymously to the French Academy, it was
reprobated. He then tore it in rage, and scat∣tered
it about his study. Towards evening, like
another Medea lamenting over the members
of her own children, he and his secretary
passed the night in uniting the scattered limbs.
He then ventured to avow himself; and, having
pretended to correct this incorrigible tragedy,
the submissive Academy retracted their censures—but the Public pronounced it's melancholy
fate, on it's first representation. This was the
tragedy which was intended to thwart Cor∣neille's
Cid. Enraged at it's success, Richelieu
even commanded the Academy to publish an
abusive <HI>Critique</HI> of it, which is well known in
<PB N="115" REF="130"/>
French literature. Boileau; on this occasion,
has these two well-turned verses—<Q><L>En vain, contre le Cid, un Ministre se ligue;</L>
<L>Tout Paris, pour Chimene, a les yeux de Rodrigue.</L></Q>
Thus translated by a friend—<Q><L>T' oppose the Cid, in vain a statesman tries;</L>
<L>All Paris, for <HI>Chimene,</HI> has <HI>Rodrigue's</HI> eyes.</L></Q></P>
<P>We must confess, however, that Cardinal
Richelieu was a great politician. Whether his
<HI>Nouveau Testament</HI> be his entire composition, is
uncertain. He must, however, have supplied
the materials, as it contains much of what none
but himself could know. These anecdotes will
serve to shew, to what a degree of self-opinion
Vanity may level a great man. He who would
attempt to display Universal Excellence, will
probably be disappointed; it is certain he will
be impelled to practise meannesses, and to act
follies, which if he has the least sensibility,
must occasion him many a pang, and many a
blush.</P>

<PB N="116" REF="131"/>
<HEAD>CARDAN.</HEAD>
<P>THE famous Cardan was born at Milan, or
at Padua, the place of his nativity being un∣certain,
in the year 1501. To great natural
powers, he added much acquired knowledge:
but, above all, he was ever desirous of informa∣tion;
and, to use the expression of a French
writer, he passed his life in continual medita∣tion.
On him the Italians have made this acute
observation—that he has written more than he
had read, and taught more than he had learnt.
He died at Rome in 1576, where he attended
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, in the character
of Physician. In his book, <HI>de Arcanis Aeter∣nitatis,</HI>
will be found a great number of cu∣rious
discoveries. Scaliger, who has written
against him, acknowledges that, in many parts
of his works, his intelligence seems greater than
that which any writer ever possessed; while, in
<PB N="117" REF="132"/>
other parts, he betrays an imbecillity of mind
which would not be excuseable in a boy. In
matters of Religion, his opinions were un∣settled:
he did not know where to chuse. All
that has been said of God, of Paradise, of Pur∣gatory,
of Hell, and of the Immortality of the
Soul, &amp;c. were things with him very disput∣able:
and we may add, that they have appear∣ed
so likewise to others not less eminent than
Cardan.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>MARTIN LUTHER AND CALVIN.</HEAD>
<P>To oppose the Church of Rome in their idea
of Prayers addressed to the Saints, <HI>Luther de∣nied
the immortality of the soul.</HI> He said it ex∣pired
with the body, but that God revived both.
So that, according to his opinion, no one could
enter into the visible presence of God till this
operation had taken place. The Romish
Church holding a contrary opinion, he treated
as impious what it inculcates concerning the
<PB N="118" REF="133"/>
immortality of the soul. These are dreadful
shifts for men who pretend to act by an im∣pulse
of the Divinity!</P>
<P>Calvin was originally named <HI>Cauvin.</HI> His
stipend, as Minister at Geneva, was as mise∣rable
as the income of a Welch Curate. He
was subject to <HI>eleven</HI> different maladies, which
continually afflicting him, irritated his dispo∣sitions.
He had, indeed, so much acerbity in his
temper, that he became unsupportable to those
who were near him. It was this that occasion∣ed
many Germans to say, 'that they preferred
being in Hell with Beza, to being in Paradise
with Calvin.' Every day he taught Theology,
preached, and held various conferences; yet,
in spite of all his occupations, he contrived to
leave behind him, as an author, nine ponderous
folios! He died at Geneva, in 1594, aged
fifty-five. He was a learned man; but he
has caused a world of woe. He strove ambi∣tiously
to overturn every thing. He was cruel
and vindictive: he occasioned the persecution
<PB N="119" REF="134"/>
of Michael Servetus, who was so cruelly put
to death in the name of a Christian Religion,
and by the hands of men who profess Evan∣gelical
Gentleness; and all this for a difference
about the Trinity!</P>
<P>It must, however, be recollected, that these
anecdotes, and these sentiments, are collected
from Catholic Writers: the first are probably
exaggerated, and the latter must be qualified by
the discernment of the Reader.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>TERTULLIAN.</HEAD>
<P>TERTULLIAN, a father of the Primitive
Church, was an African. He is a most terri∣ble
Author, and does not yield easily to the
hand of the Translator. He is all nerves; his
pen pierces like a graver: his style would ap∣pear
shocking to the present race of readers.</P>
<P>With him, <HI>Discipline</HI> means the Rights of Re∣ligion;
<HI>Faith,</HI> it's Theory; and <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Disci∣pline,</HI>
mean God and his Worship. He calls the
Christians <HI>Little Fish,</HI> because they are regene∣rated
in the <HI>waters</HI> of Baptism: those who
<PB N="120" REF="135"/>
are baptized, <HI>Candidatos Baptismi</HI>; alluding to the
White Robes the baptized wore till the suc∣ceeding
Sunday, which was therefore called
the White Sunday. This is surely burlesquing
the rites of Baptism. In this style are all his
works composed; and there have been many
writers on Sacred topics who greatly admire
these flourishes of his pen. We may approve
of their religious zeal, but not of their taste in
composition. Balzac, who pretends to be his
admirer, gives a very ingenious reason for it:
he says—'It must be confessed that his style is
obscure; but that, like the richest ebony,
through it's excess of darkness, it is bright.'
An idle conceit, like this, offers but a weak
apology for the defects of a writer.</P>
<P>Lactantius censures him for his inelegance
and harshness.</P>
<P>Malebranche says, that 'his manner of
writing dazzles the understanding; and that,
like certain authors whose imaginations are
vivid, he persuades us without the aid of rea∣son.
<PB N="121" REF="136"/>
But he was a visionary, and destitute of
judgment. His fire, his raptures, and his en∣thusiasm,
upon the most trivial subjects, plain∣ly
indicate a disordered imagination. What
hyperboles! What figures!'</P>
<P>Salmasius, the acutest commentator of the
moderns, when he undertook to examine his
writings, declared, that certainly no one ever
can understand him.</P>
<P>Yet this is one of the fathers who established
Christianity; and I am pained to observe,
that a candid criticism on so <HI>bad a writer</HI> will
be looked upon as committing an impiety to∣wards
Christianity, by certain zealots of reli∣gion,
who seem in their notions to be at least
some centuries remote from the enlightened
spirit of this Age. But let it be consider∣ed,
that I presume not to decide on matters
of religious faith, but only on those which
concern the four and twenty letters of the
Alphabet.</P>

<PB N="122" REF="137"/>
<HEAD>ABELARD.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH Abelard, an author so famous
for his writings, and his amours with Eloisa,
or rather Heloise, is ranked not among the
Orthodox, but the Heretics, because he ven∣tured
to publish opinions concerning the Tri∣nity,
which were in those times thought too
subtle and too bold; yet it is probably owing
to his superior genius that he appeared so cul∣pable
in the eyes of his enemies. The cabal
formed against him disturbed the earlier part
of his life with a thousand persecutions; till at
length they persuaded Bernard, his old <HI>friend,</HI>
but who had now turned <HI>saint,</HI> that poor
Abelard was what their malice described him
to be. Bernard, enflamed against him, con∣demned,
unheard, the unfortunate scholar. But
it is remarkable, that the book which was
burnt as unorthodox, and as the composition
of Abelard, was in fact written by Peter Lom∣bard,
<PB N="123" REF="138"/>
Bishop of Paris; a work which has
since been <HI>canonized</HI> in the Sorbonne, and on
which is founded the scholastic theology.
We may add also, that because Abelard, in the
warmth of honest indignation, had reproved
the Monks of St. Denis, in France, and St.
Gildas de Ruys, in Bretagne, for the horrid
incontinence of their lives, they joined his
enemies, and assisted to embitter the life of this
ingenious scholar; who, perhaps, was guilty of
no other crime than that of feeling too sensibly
an attachment to one who not only possessed
the enchanting attractions of the softer sex,
but what indeed is very unusual, a congeni∣ality
of disposition, and an enthusiasm of ima∣gination.</P>

<HEAD>ADAM NOT THE FIRST MAN.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the many singular opinions which
some have endeavoured to establish, and in
<PB N="124" REF="139"/>
which indeed they have themselves firmly
confided, not the least to be distinguished is
that of one Isaac de la Pereyre, of Bourdeaux.
He is the author of a book entitled, '<HI>The
Pre-Adamites,</HI>' where he attempts to shew that
Adam is not the first of men. He was always
dreaming on this during his life, and died in
it's firm belief. He would have been glad to
have known, that an ancient Rabbin was so
much inclined towards his system, that he has
even ventured to reveal the name of the <HI>Precep∣tor</HI>
of Adam! But this Rabbin (as Menage ob∣serves)
<HI>was a Rabbin,</HI> and that is saying enough.</P>
<P>When this book first made it's appearance,
it was condemned to be burnt by the hand of
the common hangman. Menage has preserv∣ed
a pretty <HI>Bon Mot</HI> of the Prince de Gue∣mene,
which passed about the time this book
made a noise. One Father Adam, a Jesuit,
preached at St. Germain, before the Queen.
The sermon was execrable; and being at the
same time very personal, was greately disliked at
<PB N="125" REF="140"/>
Court. The Queen spoke concerning it to the
Prince, and asked him his opinion. 'Madam,'
he replied, 'I am a <HI>Pre-Adamite.</HI>'—'What
does that mean?' said the Queen.'—'It is,
Madam,' the Prince wittily answered, 'that
I do not think <HI>Father Adam</HI> to be the <HI>first</HI>
of men.'</P>
<P>Voltaire, at Ferney, had also a <HI>Pere-Adam,</HI>
on whom he frequently played off this wit∣ticism
of the Prince; and those who are ac∣quainted
with his creed, may believe that his
observations on Father Adam were not a little
pungent.</P>
<P>These Pre-Adamites bring to my recollection
two humorous lines of Prior, in his Alma—<Q><L>And lest I should be wearied, Madam,</L>
<L>To cut things short, come down to Adam.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>THE ARABIC CHRONICLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arabic Chronicle of Jerusalem is only
valuable from the time of Mahomet. For such
is the stupid superstition of the Arabs, that they
<PB N="126" REF="141"/>
pride themselves on being ignorant of whatever
has passed before the mission of their Prophet.
The most curious information it contains, is
concerning the Croisades. The Abbé de
Longerue has translated several parts. He who
would be versed in the history of the Croisades,
should attend to this chronicle. It seems to
have been written with impartiality. It ren∣ders
justice to the Christian Heroes, and par∣ticularly
dwells on the gallant actions of the
Count de Saint Gilles.</P>
<P>What is worthyof observation is, that <HI>our</HI>
Historians chiefly write concerning <HI>Godfrey
de Bouillon</HI>; only the learned know that the
Count <HI>de Saint Gilles</HI> acted there so important
a character. The stories of the <HI>Saracens</HI> are
just the reverse: they speak little concern∣ing
Godfrey, and eminently distinguish Saint
Gilles.</P>
<P>Tasso has given into the more vulgar ac∣counts,
by making the former so eminent, at
the cost of the other heroes, in his Jerusalem

<HEAD>PRIOR'S HANS CARVEL.</HEAD>
<P>THE story of the Ring of Hans Carvel,
which Fontaine has so prettily set off, and Prior

yet of very ancient standing; but it has proved
so much a favourite, that a number of authors
have employed it. Menage says, that Poggius
Florentine, who died in 1459, has the merit of
it's invention▪</P>
<P>Rabelais, who has given it in his peculiar
manner, changed it's original name of Philel∣phus,
to that of Hans Carvel.</P>
<P>This tale will also be found in the eleventh
of the One Hundred New Novels collected in
1461.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="143"/>
Ariosto has borrowed it, at the end of his
fifth Satire; but, by his pleasant manner of re∣lating
it, we must confess it is fairly appro∣priated.</P>
<P>An anonymous writer, who published a Col∣lection
of Novels, at Lyons, in 1555, has also
employed it in his eleventh Novel.</P>
<P>Cellio Malespini has it again in page 288 of
the Second Part of his Two Hundred Novels,
printed at Venice in 1609.</P>
<P>Fontaine, and an anonymous writer who
has composed it in Latin Anacreontic verses,
have considered it to be a subject worthy of
their pens; and, at length, our Prior has given
it to us in his best manner: so that I may ven∣to

<HEAD>PLINY.</HEAD>
<P>PLINY was by much too bold to advance, in
his Natural History, lib. 7. cap. 35. that the
soul is not immortal. This is a dreadful senti∣ment
to be disseminated throughout a state;
for, if this principle is established, the good
will no more hope for a recompence of their
miseries, nor the bad dread a punishment for
their crimes.</P>
<P>Pliny was certainly a man of irreproachable
character: but the truth is, that, like most of
the Romans, he aspired to glory, by shewing
that he could be an honest man without the hope
of any future reward. The sentiment is noble,
but let it be confined to the narrow circle of
speculative philosophy.</P>
<P>Pliny, to express at the same time the in∣vention
and the malice of men, says, in writing
on <HI>Arrows,</HI> that they have given wings to iron,
and taught it to fly like a bird—had he even
<PB N="130" REF="145"/>
added, like a ravenous vulture, perhaps it might
have heightened this poetical image. Had he
lived when gunpowder, fire-arms, and bombs,
were invented, what metaphors could the phi∣losopher
have found to equal his indignation!
Ariosto and Milton have satirized this diabolical
machinery, when they gave them to be employ∣ed
by the demons.</P>
<P>The Younger Pliny has given (a French wit
observes) so exact a description of his house,
that it looks as if he wished to dispose of it.
Men of taste are fond of perpetuating those
scenes which their lives have been passed in
embellishing.</P>
<P>The Elder Pliny, who was so intimately ac∣quainted
with the human heart, says, on the
subject of <HI>Chrystal Vases,</HI> that their fragility
enhances their price; and that it is the boast of
Luxury to make use of things that may, at the
slightest blow, entirely perish.</P>
<P>The Younger Pliny has this admirable sen∣timent—That
he is a good man, and of strict

committed faults every day; and yet, who
endeavours to abstain from them, as if he par∣doned

<Q><L>Bien heureux Scudery, dont la fertile plume</L>
<L>Peut enfanter tous les mois une petite volume!</L></Q>
<P>IT is Boileau who has written the above
couplet on the Scuderies, the brother and sister,
both famous in their day for composing Ro∣mances,
which they sometimes extended to ten
or twelve volumes. It was the favourite lite∣rature
of that period, as much as the <HI>Novels</HI> of
the present times; or, to be more correct, of the
present hour. Our Nobility not infrequently
condescended to translate these voluminous
compositions.</P>
<P>The diminutive size of our modern Novels
is undoubtedly an improvement; but, in re∣sembling
the size of <HI>Primers,</HI> it were to be wished
that their contents had also resembled their in∣offensive
<PB N="132" REF="147"/>
page. Our great-grandmothers were
incommoded with overgrown folios; and, in∣stead
of finishing the eventful history of two
lovers at one or two sittings, it was sometimes
six months, <HI>including Sundays,</HI> before they could
get quit of their Clelias, their Cyrus's, and
Parthenissas.</P>
<P>Mademoiselle Scudery, Menage informs us,
had composed <HI>ninety volumes!</HI> the materials of
which were entirely drawn from her own fer∣tile
invention. She had even finished another
Romance; but which she would not give to the
Public, whose taste, she saw, no more relished
these kinds of works.</P>
<P>' What a pleasing description,' he elsewhere
observes, 'has Mademoiselle Scudery made in
her Cyrus of the Little Court at Rambouillet!
There are a thousand things in the Romances
of this learned lady that render them inesti∣mable.
She has drawn from the Ancients their
happiest passages, and has even improved upon
them. Like the Prince in the fable, whatever
<PB N="133" REF="148"/>
she touches becomes gold. We may read her
works with great profit, if we posses a correct
taste, and wish to gather instruction. Those
who censure their <HI>length,</HI> only shew the little∣ness
of their judgment; as if Homer and Virgil
were to be despised, because many of their
books are filled with episodes and incidents that
necessarily retard the conclusion. It does not
require much penetration to observe, that <HI>Cyrus</HI>
and <HI>Clelia</HI> are species of the <HI>Epic</HI> poem. The
Epic must embrace a number of events to su∣spend
the course of the narrative; which only
taking in a part of the life of the hero, would
terminate too soon to discover the skill of the
poet. Without this artifice, the charm of
uniting the greater part of the Episodes to the
principal subject of the Romance would be lost.
Mademoiselle de Scudery has so well treated
them, and so aptly introduced a variety of beau∣tiful
passages, that nothing in this kind is com∣parable
to her productions. If we except some
expressions, and certain turns, which have be∣come
<PB N="134" REF="149"/>
somewhat obsolete, all the rest will last
for ever, and outlive the criticisms they have
undergone.'</P>
<P>Menage has here certainly uttered a false
prophecy. Her Romances I only know by their
names; but this <HI>Critique</HI> must be allowed to be
given rather in the spirit of friendship than of
true criticism.</P>
<P>I shall add to this article the sentiments of a
modern French writer, who has displayed great
ingenuity in his strictures.</P>
<P>' The misfortune of her having written too
abundantly has occasioned an unjust contempt.
We confess there are many heavy and tedious
passages in her voluminous Romances; but if
we consider that, in the Clelia and the Artamene,
are to be found inimitable delicate touches, and
many splendid parts which would do honour to
some of our living writers, we must acknowledge
that the great defects of all her works arise from
her not writing in an age when taste had reached
the acmé of cultivation which it now has. Such
<PB N="135" REF="150"/>
is her erudition, that the French place her next
to the celebrated Madame Dacier. Her works,
containing many secret intrigues of the court
and city, her readers relished, on their early
publication, more keenly than we can at pre∣sent.'</P>

<HEAD>THE SCALIGERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Man of Letters must confess—re∣luctantly,
perhaps—that the literature which
stores the head with so many ingenious re∣flections,
and so much admirable intelligence,
may at the same time have little or no influence
over the virtues of the heart. The same vices,
and the same follies, disgrace the literate and
the illiterate. Who possessed a profounder
knowledge of the Grecian learning, or was a
more erudite critic, than <HI>Burman?</HI> Yet this
man lived unobservant of every ordinary de∣cency
and moral duty. Who displayed more
acuteness of mind, and a wider circle of lite∣rature,
<PB N="136" REF="151"/>
than the <HI>Scaligers?</HI> Yet, from the
anecdotes and characters I collect of them, let
the reader contemplate the <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>The two Scaligers, father and son, were two
prodigies of learning and of vanity. Schiop∣pius
has tore the mask of that principality with
which the father had adorned himself; for the
elder Scaliger maintained that he was descended
from the Princes of Verona. Schioppius says,
and he is now credited, that he was originally
named Jules Burden; that he was born in the
shop of a gilder; had passed some part of his
life with a surgeon; and then became a cor∣delier.
The elevation of his mind made him
aspire to honours greater than these: he threw
off his frock, and took the degree of Doctor
in Physic at Paris. In this character he ap∣peared
at Venice, and in Piedmont. He there
attached himself to a Prelate of the noble
House of Rovezza, and followed him to Agen,
of which his patron was made Bishop. He
there married the daughter of an apothecary.
<PB N="137" REF="152"/>
Such were the parents of Joseph Scaliger;
who, finding this chimerical principality in his
family, passed himself for a <HI>Prince</HI>; and, to
render the impositions of his father more
credible, he added many of his own.</P>
<P>Naudé speaks thus concerning them—'They
say, in Italy, that Scaliger's father married, at
Agen, the daughter of an apothecary; though
others affirm, the bastard of a bishop:' pro∣bably,
of the prelate he followed. 'His son
Scaliger was visited in the character of a <HI>Prince</HI>
at Leyden.'</P>
<P>By this, I think, it appears that Naudé
gives him credit for the principality; for he
seems not in the least to smile at the ho∣nour.</P>
<P>' The Duke de Nevers, having paid him a
visit, offered him a considerable present, which
Scaliger civilly refused.'</P>
<P>The pride of this supposititious Prince, who
was but a poor student, must have run high!</P>
<P>' Schioppius,' adds Naudé, 'must have
<PB N="138" REF="153"/>
been under the influence of some demon when
he wrote so bad a book against Scaliger:' yet
Menage observes of this work, that Joseph
Scaliger died of the chagrin he felt on the
occasion of Schioppius's book being published,
entitled, <HI>Scaliger Hypobolymaeus.</HI></P>
<P>' Yet we may,' observes Huet, 'say, with
Lipsius, that if the two Scaligers were not
actually Princes, they richly merited a princi∣pality
for the beauty of their genius and the
extent of their erudition; but we can offer
no apology for their ridiculous and singular
haughtiness.</P>
<P>' When a friend was delineating his character,
the father wrote to him in these terms—"En∣deavour
to collect whatever is most beautiful in
the pages of Masinissa, of Xenophon, and of
Plato, and you may then form a portrait which,
however, will resemble me but imperfectly."</P>
<P>Yet this man possessed little delicacy of taste,
as he evinces by the false judgments he passes
on Homer and Musaeus; and, above all, by
<PB N="139" REF="154"/>
those unformed and rude poems with which
he has dishonoured Parnassus. I have read
somewhere a French sonnet by this man, which
is beneath criticism. Menage says, that the
collection of Scaliger's poems, which forms a
thick octavo volume, will hardly find it's equal
for bad composition, considering them as the
productions of a man of letters. Of a great
number of epigrams, there are but four or five
which are in the least tolerable.</P>
<P>Huet thinks that his son composed those
letters which pass under his name; and, as he
is an exquisite judge of style, we should credit
his opinion. But, though his poetry is so
destitute of spirit or grace, his prose, it must
be allowed, is excellent: nothing can be more
noble, higher polished, or more happily
turned.</P>
<P>The son possessed a finer taste: his style is
more flowing and easy, and yet is not the less
noble. His writings, like those of the father,
breathe singular haughtiness and malignity.
<PB N="140" REF="155"/>
The Scaligerana will convince us that he was
incapable of thinking or speaking favourably
of any person. Although he has reflected
honour on his age by the extensiveness of his
learning, we must confess that he has not sel∣dom
fallen into gross errors, even on those
subjects to which he had most applied. As
for instance, Chronology, which was his fa∣vourite
study; and although he imagined that
he stretched the sceptre over the realms of
Criticism, no one has treated this topic with
less felicity. It was the reform of the Calendar
then pending at Rome which engaged him in
this study. He wished to shew the world that
he was more capable than all those who had
been employed. If the success of this labour
had depended on the extent and variety of
erudition, he had eminently surpassed all those
who had applied to this task; but he was their
inferior in the solidity of his judgment, in the
exactness of his arguments, and the profundity
of his speculations. When he fondly believed
<PB N="141" REF="156"/>
that he had found the Quadrature of the Circle,
he was corrected, and turned into ridicule, by
an obscure schoolmaster; who, having clearly
pointed out the paralogism which deceived him,
made his cyclometrics vanish at his touch.</P>
<P>' Scaliger, the father, was,' says Patin, 'an
illustrious impostor. He had never been at
any war, nor at any court of the Emperor
Maximilian, as he pretended. He passed the
first thirty years of his life in one continued
study. Afterwards, he threw off his monk's
frock, and palmed on all Europe the singular
imposition of his being a descendant of the
Princes of Verona, who bore the name of
Scaliger.</P>
<P>Julius Scaliger had this peculiarity in his
manner of composition: he wrote with
such accuracy, that his manuscript and the
printed copy always corresponded page for
page, and line for line. This may appear
trifling information; but I am persuaded that
<PB N="142" REF="157"/>
a habit of correctness in the lesser parts of com∣position
assists the higher.</P>
<P>George Psalmanazar, well known in the
literary world, exceeded in powers of decep∣tion
any of the great impostors of learning.
His Island of Formosa was an illusion emi∣nently
bold, and maintained with as much
felicity as erudition; and vast must have been
that erudition which could, on scientific prin∣ciples,
form a language and it's grammar.</P>

<P>The Society of the <HI>Port Royal des Champs—</HI>
that was the original title—took this name
from a valley about six leagues from Paris.</P>
<P>In the year 1637, <HI>Le Maitre,</HI> a celebrated
Advocate, renounced the Bar, and resigned
the honour of being <HI>Conseiller d'Etat,</HI> which
his uncommon merit had obtained him,
though then only twenty-eight years of age.
His brother, <HI>De Sericourt,</HI> who had followed
the military profession, quitted it at the same
time. Both consecrating themselves to the
service of God, they retired into a little house
near <HI>the Port Royal</HI> of Paris. Their brothers,
<HI>De Sacy, De St. Elme,</HI> and <HI>De Valmont,</HI> joined
them. For some political reason, they were
constrained to remove themselves from that
spot, and they then fixed their residence at
<HI>Port Royal des Champs.</HI> There again the
Court disturbed them, after a residence of
<PB N="147" REF="162"/>
little more than two months; but, about a
year afterwards, they again returned.</P>
<P>With these illustrious Recluses many per∣sons
of distinguished merit now retired: and
it was this Community which has been since
called <HI>the Society of Port Royal.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the members, was the celebrated
Arnauld, and others, whose names would re∣flect
a lustre on any society.</P>
<P>Here were no rules, no vows, no constitu∣tion,
and no cells formed. Prayer and study
were their only occupations. They applied
themselves to the education of young men,
and initiated the rising generation into science
and into virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Racine</HI> here received his education; and,
on his death-bed, desired to be buried in the
cemetery of the Port Royal, at the feet of
M. Hamon. An amiable instance, this, of
the Poet's sensibility!</P>
<P>Anne de Bourbon, a Princess of the blood-royal,
erected a house near the Port Royal,
<PB N="148" REF="163"/>
and was, during her life, the powerful pa∣troness
of these solitary and religious men:
but her death happening in 1679, gave the

<P>PERE BOUHOURS observes, that the Spanish
Poets display an extravagant imagination,
which is by no means destitute of <HI>wit</HI>; but
which evinces little taste or judgment.</P>
<P>Their verses are much in the style of
our Cowley—trivial Points, monstrous Me∣taphors,

<P>A true poetical taste is not pleased with
such wild chimeras, but requires the fine
touches of Nature and Passion.</P>
<P>Lopes de Vega, in describing an afflicted
Shepherdess, in one of his Pastorals, who is
represented weeping near the sea-side, says—<PB N="150" REF="165"/>

<HEAD>SAINT EVREMOND.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of St. Evremond, delineated
by his own hand, will not be unacceptable to
many readers.</P>
<P>A French Critic has observed of this writer,
that he had great wit, and frequently has
written well; but there is a strange inequa∣lity
throughout his works.</P>
<P>The comparisons which he has formed be∣twixt
some of the illustrious Ancients, are ex∣cellent;
the Criticisms which he has given on
several Authors, are valuable: but, in the greater
part of his works, he sinks to mediocrity.
His Poetry is insipid, and not the composi∣tion
of Genius, but Study. His prosaic style
is too full of points: the Antithesis was his
favourite figure, and he is continually employ∣ing
it.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="168"/>
This last censure, I am fearful, may reach
the present character which he has given of
himself: but still it is ingenious, and offers a
lively picture to the imagination—</P>
<P>' I am a Philosopher, as far removed from
superstition as from impiety; a Voluptuary,
who has not less abhorrence for debauchery
than inclination for pleasure; a Man, who
has never known want nor abundance. I oc∣cupy
that station of life, which is despised by
those who possess every thing; envied by
those who have nothing, and only relished by
those who make their felicity to consist in the
exercise of their reason. Young, I hated dis∣sipation;
convinced that a man must possess
wealth to provide for the comforts of a long
life: old, I disliked oeconomy; as I believed
that we need not greatly dread want, when
we have but a short time to be miserable. I
am satisfied with what Nature has done for
me; nor do I repine at Fortune. I do not
seek in men what they have of evil, that I
<PB N="154" REF="169"/>
may censure; I only find out what they have
ridiculous, that I may be amused. I feel a
pleasure in detecting their follies; I should
feel a greater in communicating my discove∣ries,
did not my prudence restrain me. Life
is too short, according to my ideas, to read
all kinds of books, and to load our memory
with an infinite number of things, at the cost
of our judgment. I do not attach myself to
the sentiments of scientific men, to acquire
Science; but to the most rational, that I may
strengthen my reason. Sometimes, I seek for
the more delicate minds, that my taste may
imbibe their delicacy; sometimes, for the
gayer, that I may enrich my genius with their
gaiety: and, although I constantly read, I
make it less may occupation than my pleasure.
In Religion, and in Friendship, I have only to
paint myself such as I am—in friendship, more
tender than a philosopher; and, in religion,
as constant, and as sincere, as a Youth who
has more simplicity than experience. My
<PB N="155" REF="170"/>
Piety is composed more of justice and charity,
than of penitence. I rest my confidence on
God, and hope every thing from His benevo∣lence.
In the bosom of Providence I find my

<HEAD>CORNEILLE AND ADDISON.</HEAD>
<P>THE Student, who may, perhaps, shine a
luminary of Learning and of Genius, in the

lie obscured beneath a thick cloud in collo∣quial
discourse.</P>
<P>It is the Superficial Mind that reflects little,
but speaks fluently; and that appears to the
vulgar, who are better judges of the quantity
than of the quality of words, a constellation
of abilities.</P>
<P>If you love the Man of Letters, seek him
in the privacies of his study; or, if he be
a Man of Virtue, take him to your bosom.
It is in the hour of confidence and tranquil∣lity,
<PB N="156" REF="171"/>
his Genius may elicit a ray of intelli∣gence,
more fervid than the labours of po∣lished
composition.</P>
<P>The great Peter Corneille, whose genius
resembled that of our Shakespeare, and who
has so forcibly expressed the sublime senti∣ments
of the Hero, had nothing in his exte∣rior
manners that indicated his genius: on the
contrary, his conversation was so insipid, that
it never failed of wearying his auditors. Na∣ture,
who had lavished on him the extraordi∣nary
gifts of Genius, had forgotten, or rather
disdained, to blend with them her more
ordinary ones. He did not even <HI>speak,</HI> cor∣rectly,
that language, of which he was such a
master.</P>
<P>When his friends represented to him, in
the trite cant of the vulgar, how much more
he might please, by not disdaining to correct
these trivial errors; he would smile, and say,
'<HI>I am not the less Peter Corneille!</HI>'</P>
<P>The deficiencies of Addison, in conversation,
<PB N="157" REF="172"/>
are well known. He preserved a rigid silence
amongst strangers; but, if he was silent, it
was the silence of Meditation. He, probably,
at that moment, laboured more in his reflec∣tions,
than had he been in his study.</P>
<P>The vulgar may <HI>talk</HI>; but it is for Genius

in the Alphonsean Tables, made by the order
of Alphonso, son of Ferdinand, King of Cas∣tile;
who employed, for this purpose, Isaac
Hazan, a Jew singer, of the Synagogue of
Toledo; and Aben Ragel, an Arabian. The
Arabs took them from the Indians, in 900.
The other Eastern nations received them
through the means of the Spaniards, in a

Greek who made use of them, was Plenudes,
in a work dedicated to Michael Paleologus, in
1270; so that the Greeks had them not from
the Arabs, but the Latins.</P>
<P>These cyphers were first used at Paris, in

<HEAD>NOBLEMEN TURNED CRITICS.</HEAD>
<P>I OFFER to the contemplation of those un∣fortunate
mortals, who are necessitated to
undergo the criticisms of <HI>Lords,</HI> this pair of
Anecdotes—</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="180"/>
A Cardinal having caused a statue to be
made at Rome, by the great <HI>Angelo,</HI> when it
was finished, he came to inspect it; and
having, for some time, sagaciously considered
it, poring now on the face, then on the arms,
the knees, the form of the leg, and, at length,
on the foot itself; the statue being of such per∣fect
beauty, he found himself at a loss to display
his powers of criticism, but by lavishing his
praise. But he recollected, that only to praise,
might appear as if there had been an obtuseness
in the keenness of his criticism. He trembled to
find a fault, but a fault must be found. At length,
he ventured to mutter something concerning
the nose; it might, he thought, be something
more Grecian. <HI>Angelo</HI> differed from his Grace,
but he said he would attempt to gratify his
taste. He took up his chissel, and concealed
some marble-dust in his hand; and, feigning to
retouch the part, he adroitly let fall some of the
dust he held concealed. The Cardinal observ∣ing
it fall, transported at the idea of his critical
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
acumen, exclaimed—'Ah, <HI>Angelo!</HI> you have
now given to it an inimitable grace!'</P>
<P>When <HI>Pope</HI> was first introduced to read his
Iliad to Lord Halifax, the noble Critic did not
venture to be dissatisfied with so perfect a
composition: but, like the Cardinal, this pas∣sage,
and that word, this turn, and that expres∣sion,
formed the broken cant of his criticisms.
The honest Poet was stung with vexation;
for, in general, the parts at which his lordship
hesitated, were those of which he was most sa∣tisfied.
As he returned home with Sir Samuel
Garth, he revealed to him the anxiety of his
mind. 'Oh,' replied Garth, laughing,
'you are not so well acquainted with his
lordship as myself; he must criticise. At your
next visit, read to him those very passages as
they now stand; tell him, that you have recol∣lected
his criticisms; and I'll warrant you of his
approbation of them. This is what I have
done a hundred times myself.' <HI>Pope</HI> made
use of this stratagem: it took, like the marble∣dust

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>THE ART OF CRITICISM.</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent French Writer has thus very
ingeniously traced the origin of Criticism.</P>
<P>The Art of Criticism is by no means a mo∣dern
invention; but it must be confessed, that
in the last age alone it hath reached it's pre∣sent
degree of perfection.</P>
<P>According to Dion Chrysostom, <HI>Aristotle</HI>
is the inventor of Criticism; it is, at least, cer∣tain
that it appeared about his time.</P>
<P><HI>Aristarchus,</HI> who flourished at Samos, about
one hundred and fifty years before the Chris∣tian
Aera, wrote nine books of Corrections of
the Iliad and Odyssey, and spread a general
alarm amongst the race of Authors; insomuch
that, to the present day, a <HI>Critic,</HI> and an <HI>Ari∣starchus,</HI>
are synonimous words.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183"/>
As the Sciences were, for a long time, neg∣lected,
Criticism shared the same fate. There
were, however, even in the most barbarous
ages, a few learned men who cultivated it. At
the restoration of Letters, Criticism, by the ef∣forts
of many celebrated Scholars, sprung up
with new vigour. But two important events
contributed equally to the revival of Letters
and of Criticism: the taking of Constantinople,
by the Turks, which occasioned several of the
learned to retire into Italy and France; and
the invention of Printing, which was discovered
about that time.</P>
<P>As soon as this admirable Art was made
public, they applied themselves to publish∣ing
excellent Editions of all the good Au∣thors,
according to the most correct Manu∣scripts.
They were indefatigable in their re∣searches
for the most ancient copies, and they
collated them with the modern ones, by the
strictest rules of Criticism.</P>
<P>Some formed <HI>Dictionaries</HI> and <HI>Grammars</HI> of
<PB N="169" REF="184"/>
different languages; and some <HI>Commentaries,</HI>
for illustrating the Text. Others composed
<HI>Treatises</HI> on Fabulous History, on the Religion,
Government, and the Military Operations of
the Ancients. They dwelt on the minutest
particularities which concerned their Manners,
their Apparel, their Repasts, their Amusements,
&amp;c. In a word, they neglected nothing which,
after so wide an interval, might throw new
lights on what remained of the Grecian and
the Roman Compositions.</P>
<P>The Learned of the Sixteenth Century made
new efforts, not only to clear the uncultivated
lands of the Republic of Letters, which had
remained unexplored by their predecessors, but
also to improve those they had inherited. They
prided themselves in the freest discussions; they
rummaged every library, to bring to light un∣noticed
Manuscripts; they compared them to∣gether:
they arranged those historical facts
which were necessary to restore the texts, and
to six the dates; and they were careful, above
<PB N="170" REF="185"/>
all things, not to decide on the sense of a pas∣sage,
without a mature examination, and a
laborious collation.</P>
<P>Yet, after the immense labours of Justus
Lipsius, the Scaligers, Turnebus, Budaeus, Eras∣mus,
and so many other learned men, Criticism
still remained imperfect; and it is only in the
last age that it attained to the height which it
now has reached.</P>
<P>This perfection of Criticism is owing to the
establishment of ACADEMIES, particularly
those of the French and the Belles Lettres
Academies. In their labours may be found
those numerous and judicious Remarks, which
had escaped the penetration of the first Scho∣lars
in Europe.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this Article, without observing,
that it is much to the dishonour of the na∣tional
character, no Academy, dedicated to the
BELLES LETTRES, has ever been established.
To raise such an ACADEMY, is a glory still
reserved for an Augustan Monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="186"/>
Louis XIV. has all his foibles forgiven
by Posterity, when they contemplate the mu∣nificent
patronage he bestowed on Men of
Letters. The splendours of Royalty, and the
trophies of Ambition, may elevate the voice of
Adulation; but they expire with the Hero and
the Monarch. The beneficial influence of Li∣terature
is felt through successive ages; and
they, indeed, are the Benefactors of mankind,
who bestow on posterity their most refined
pleasures, and their most useful speculations.</P>

<HEAD>THE ABSENT MAN.</HEAD>
<P>WITH the character of Bruyere's Absent
Man, it is probable, the reader is well ac∣quainted.
It is translated in the Spectator, and
it has been exhibited on the Theatre. The
general opinion runs, that it is a fictitious
character, or, at least, one the Author has too
highly coloured: it was well known, however,
to his contemporaries, to be the Count De
<PB N="172" REF="187"/>
Brancas. The present Anecdotes concerning
the same person, have been unknown to, or
forgotten by, Bruyere; and, as they are un∣doubtedly
genuine, and, at the same time,
to the full as extraordinary as those which
characterize <HI>Menalcas,</HI> or the Absent Man; it
is but reasonable to suppose, that the character,
however improbable it may appear, is a faith∣ful
delineation from Nature.</P>
<P>One day, when the Count was walking in
the street, the Duke de la Rochefoucault
crossed the way, to speak to him. 'God bless
thee, poor man!' exclaimed the Count. Ro∣chefoucault
smiled, and was beginning to ad∣dress
him—'Is it not enough,' cried the
Count, interrupting him, and somewhat in a
passion; 'is it not enough that I have said,
at first, I have nothing for you? Such lazy
beggars as you hinder a gentleman from walk∣ing
the streets.' Rochefoucault burst into a
loud laugh; and awakening the Absent Man
from his lethargy, he was not a little surprized,
<PB N="173" REF="188"/>
himself, that he should take his friend for an
importunate mendicant!</P>
<P>The Count was reading by the fire-side, but
Heaven knows with what degree of attention,
when the nurse brought him his infant-child.
He throws down the book; he takes the child
in his arms—he was playing with her, when
an important visitor was announced. Having
forgot he had quitted his book, and that it was
his child he held in his hands, he threw her
down violently on the table; and, probably,
was surprized to hear loud cries issue from his
book.</P>

<HEAD>METAPHORS.</HEAD>
<P>CARDINAL PERRON has a very judicious
criticism on <HI>Metaphors.</HI> Cicero compares
them to Virgins, who should not too fami∣liarly
shew themselves, and who must appear
without affection. We frequently meet with
many that are not only vicious, but disgustful,
<PB N="174" REF="189"/>
and have nothing of that by which Cicero is
desirous they should be distinguished.</P>
<P>Is it possible that some Authors are igno∣rant
that <HI>Style</HI> is meant to delight! And,
if they write vicious and disgustful <HI>Metaphors,</HI>
should they even convey to the reader their
meaning, they must offend?—Such as those
which a fanatical Preacher employed, when
he called on the Lord to wipe his lips with
the <HI>napkin</HI> of his love; and when he talked of
the <HI>lamp</HI> of love, and the <HI>candle</HI> of divine
grace.</P>
<P>Bishop Latimer preached, in the year 1527,
a sermon, in which he says—'Now, ye have
heard what is meant by this <HI>first card,</HI> and how
ye ought to <HI>play:</HI> I purpose again to <HI>deal</HI> unto
you another <HI>card</HI> of the same <HI>suit</HI>; for they be
of so nigh affinity, that one cannot be <HI>well
played</HI> without the other.'</P>
<P>About the middle of the Seventeenth Cen∣tury,
a country minister—Fuller informs us—imitated these ridiculous allusions of Latimer;
<PB N="175" REF="190"/>
but the congregation, now somewhat more re∣fined
than in the good Bishop's time, could not
refrain from immoderate peals of laughter.</P>
<P>Perron observes, that in employing <HI>Meta∣phors,</HI>
we must not descend from the <HI>general</HI>
to the <HI>particular:</HI> we may be allowed to say—the <HI>flames</HI> of love, but not the <HI>candle,</HI> the
<HI>lamp,</HI> and the <HI>wick</HI> of love. Saint Anselm
exclaims—'<HI>Draw</HI> me, O Lord! that I may
<HI>run</HI> after thee; fasten me with the <HI>cords</HI> of thy
Love!' The <HI>Metaphor</HI> is a little similitude, or
an abridgment of a similitude—it must pass
quick; we must not dwell upon it; when it
is too far continued, it is vicious, and degene∣rates
into an <HI>Enigma.</HI></P>
<P>Pere Bouhours also observes, that Meta∣phors
must not be continued too far, and
that when they are thus overstrained, they be∣come
trifling and frigid. These two instances
will explain what is here meant—</P>
<P>An Italian, on his return from Poland, said,
that the persons of that country were as white
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
as their snows; but, that they were even colder
than they were white; and that frequently,
from their conversations, he caught a <HI>cold.</HI></P>
<P>Costar says, that the Lectures of Malherbe
were satiating and cloying to a degre—so as to
destroy the <HI>appetite</HI> of those who heard them,
and to save them the expence of a <HI>dinner.</HI></P>
<P>Of the first it is to be observed, that <HI>Cold,</HI> as
a figure, is an established Metaphor; but that
from this cold we are likely to catch one, is
what passes the just limits of the Metaphor, as
well as those lectures, which cloyed till they
occasioned a loss of appetite, and saved the ex∣pence
of a dinner.</P>
<P>It was saying enough, that they were satiating
and disagreeable, without adding the rest, which
goes to such an extreme, and which is not
likely. This, however, must be understood,
when the Author speaks in a serious style:
for, if he means to employ such Metaphors
with levity, and in joking, they would then
not shock us; because, when we laugh, we
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
may be allowed great latitude; and, according
to Aristotle and Quintilian, whenever we
joke, the falsest thoughts have, in some mea∣sure,
a true sense.</P>
<P>To illustrate this criticism. Let us try these
two thoughts; which, however carried far,
have great merit, when we reflect on the man∣ner
in which they must be understood.</P>
<P>An ancient Satirist says, that if we wish to
temper an overheated bath, we have only to
beg a certain Rhetorician to enter; because he
was remarkable for frigidity in his discourses.
A modern Satirist declares, he was lately
frozen at reading a certain Elegy of a miserable
Poetaster; and that the polar frosts do not, by
many degrees, approach it.</P>

I had remarked, in reading Gibbon, two
matters, in which he has been grossly mista∣ken.
One was, the Standard of our English Coin,

Sect who used to fast on certain days,
he adds—'They probably derived this custom
from that of the Jews fasting on their Sab∣bath.'
This is a flagrant error; since it has
always been their custom, rather to indulge
in festal enjoyments on that day. It is, with
them, a rule to observe no Fast on the Sabbath,
though it might be the anniversary of the most
remarkable event. The day of Expiation is
the only Fast permitted to be kept on the
Seventh day. I have endeavoured to find out

the Lionnois, who assembled a Synod to re∣form
the regulations of Saint Anthony in that

pains of making <HI>eight repasts</HI> in one day, to

<P>There were some Jesuits, and some young

<P>The contest was renewed with vigour on the

out—<HI>Let us keep—let us keep—keep our∣selves—</HI>&amp;c.</P>

the force to resist all the salutary reforms
which Reason and Good-sense so loudly call

<HEAD>ON THE CUSTOM OF SALUTING AFTER
SNEEZING.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Catholics—says Father Feyjoo—have
attributed the origin of this custom to the or∣dinance
of a Pope—Saint Gregory—who is said
to have instituted a short Prayer to be used on
such occasions, at a time when a Pestilence
raged; the crisis of which was attended by
<HI>sneezing,</HI> and, in most cases, followed by <HI>death.</HI></P>
<P>The Rabbins have a tale, that, before Jacob,
men never sneezed but <HI>once,</HI> and then imme∣diately
<HI>died:</HI> but that that Patriarch obtained
the revocation of this law; the memory of
which was ordered to be preserved in <HI>all na∣tions,</HI>
by a command of every Prince to his
subjects to employ some salutary exclamation
after the act of sneezing.</P>
<P>These accounts are, probably, alike fabu∣lous;
the pious fictions of pious men; both
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
because—continues Feyjoo—the enquiries of
Aristotle concerning this strange circumstance,
and the allusions to it in Apuleius, Petronius,
Pliny, and others, prove it to have existed
many ages prior to Saint Gregory; and it is
related, in a Memoir of the French Academy
of Sciences, to have been found practised in
the New World, on the first discovery of Ame∣rica.
This is not only said to be a fact, but
some Writers also give us an amusing account
of the ceremonies which attend the <HI>sneezing</HI> of
a King of Monomotapa—Those who are near
his person, when this happens, salute him in
so loud a tone, that those who are in the anti∣chamber
hear it, and join in the acclamation.
Those who are in the adjoining apartments do
the same, until the noise reaches the street, and
becomes propagated throughout the city: so
that, at each sneeze of his Majesty, results a
most horrid cry from the saluations of many
thousands of his vassals.</P>
<P>That a custom, so universally prevalent,

should have no plausible reason to support it,
is rather curious.</P>

<P><PB N="184" REF="199"/>
' A Student at Law, who studied at Poitiers,
had tolerably improved himself in cases of
Equity; not that he was overburthened with
Learning, but his chief deficiency was a want
of assurance and confidence to display his know∣ledge.
His father passing by Poitiers, recom∣mended
him to read aloud, and to render his
memory more prompt by a continued exercise.
To obey the injunctions of his father, he deter∣mined
to read at the <HI>Ministery.</HI> In order to obtain
a certain assurance, he went every day into a
garden, which was a very secret spot, being at
a distance from any house, and where there
grew a great number of fine large cabbages.
Thus, for a long time, as he pursued his studies,
he went to repeat his lesson to these cabbages,
addressing them by the title of <HI>Gentlemen</HI>;
and dealing out his sentences, as if they had
composed an audience of Scholars at a Lec∣ture.
After having prepared himself thus
for a fortnight or three weeks, he began to
think it was high time to take the <HI>chair</HI>;
<PB N="185" REF="200"/>
imagining that he should be able to harangue
the Scholars, as well as he had before done his
cabbages. He comes forward, he begins his
Oration—but, before he had said a dozen
words, he remained dumb, and became so
confused, that he knew not where he was:
so that all he could bring out was—<HI>Domini,
Ego bene video quod non estis caules:</HI> that is to
say—for there are some who will have every
thing in plain English—<HI>Gentlemen, I now
clearly see you are not cabbages.</HI> In the <HI>garden,</HI>
he could conceive the <HI>cabbages</HI> to be <HI>Scholars</HI>;
but, in the <HI>chair,</HI> he could not conceive the
<HI>Scholars</HI> to be <HI>cabbages.</HI>'</P>
<P>The hall of the School of Equity, at Poi∣tiers,
where the Institutes were read, was
called <HI>La Ministerie.</HI> On which head, Flori∣mond
de Remond, (Book vii. Ch. 11.) speaking
of Albert Babinot, one of the first disciples of
Calvin, after having said he was called 'The

the ties of friendship. Attentive to fill

<HEAD>RELIGIOUS ENMITY.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK the present Article, which I have
drawn from Naudé, while it contains some
pleasing Anecdotes, is just and philosophical.</P>
<P>' When I was at Rome, I could not help tell∣ing
many Devotees, that when <HI>Religion</HI> seizes
and overpowers the Mind, it makes it consider
<PB N="188" REF="203"/>
<HI>actions</HI> and <HI>characters</HI> through the medium of
interest, and hence it should not be relied on▪
For instance: the ancient Fathers have said
every thing they could imagine to depreciate
the character of Julian the Apostate. Though
they had not done this, had he not proved an
apostate and a persecutor of the Christians;
they do not in the slightest manner notice his
many eminent qualities. He was rigorously just,
a man of strict morals, and a great politician.
See what Montaigne and La Mothe le Vayer
observe of him; and particularly his cha∣racter,
elaborately delineated by Mr. Gibbon.</P>
<P>It is thus also in Venice. Anthony Braga∣din
passes for a Martyr, because he was flayed
alive at the command of Mustapha, after the
taking of Famagusta. But the fact is, that the
Turks are only like other men; and they thus
punished Bragadin, and his other Christian
Captains, because, when they saw they must
be taken by Mustapha, they barbarously cut
the throats of all their Turkish prisoners.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="204"/>
It is owing also to this cause, that the De∣votees
say every thing favourable of Mary
Stuart, Queen of Scotland, because she at∣tended
Mass very constantly; though it must
be confessed, that her conduct was seldom re∣gulated
by decency and morality. I saw, at
Rome—adds Naudé—the Letters she wrote
to the Earl of Bothwell, <HI>Subactori suo.</HI> And I
cannot but believe whatever has been said of
her by Buchanan and De Thou—It is proba∣ble
that Mr. Whitaker, and the <HI>few</HI> who are
possessed with the same Quixotism, will not
agree with this last sentiment of Naudé.</P>

<HEAD>THE MONK TURNED AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prior of one of the most celebrated

wished to be governed by his opinion. Va∣rillas
<PB N="190" REF="205"/>
at length yielded to the entreaties of
the Prior; and, to regale the Critic, they laid
on two tables, for his inspection, Seven enor∣mous
Volumes in Folio!!</P>
<P>This rather disheartened our Reviewer; but
greater was his astonishment, when, having
opened the first volume, he found it's title to
be, <HI>Summa Dei-parae</HI>; and, as Saint Thomas
had made a <HI>Sum,</HI> or System of Theology, so
our Monk had formed a <HI>Sum</HI> of the <HI>Virgin!</HI>

had treated <HI>Three Thousand</HI> Questions concern∣ing

not a single one had ever yet been imagined

<P>Perhaps, a more extraordinary design was

with great prudence and good-nature, to amuse
the honest old Monk with the hope of print∣ing

these Seven Folios, but always to start
some new difficulties; for it would be inhu∣man

<HEAD>ALCHYMY.</HEAD>
<P>IT was but the other day, I read an Adver∣tisement
in a Newspaper, from one who pre∣tends
to have made great discoveries in the
Hermetic Art. With the assistance of 'a <HI>little
money,</HI>' he could '<HI>positively</HI>' assure the lover of
this Science, that he would repay him 'a <HI>thou∣sand
fold!</HI>' This Science, if it merits to be dis∣tinguished
by the name, is most certainly an
imposition; which, striking on the feeblest part
of the human mind, has so frequently been
successful in carrying on it's delusions.</P>
<P>As late as the days of Mrs. Manley, the
authoress of the Atalantis, is there on record
a most singular delusion of Alchymy. The
recollection, whether it was herself, or ano∣ther
person, on whom it was practised, has
now escaped me. From the circumstances, it
is very probable, the Sage was not less de∣ceived
than his Patroness.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="211"/>
It appears, that an infatuated lover of this
delusive Art met with one who pretended to
have the power of transmuting Lead to Gold.
This Hermetic Philosopher required only the
materials, and time, to perform his golden
operations. He was taken to the country resi∣dence
of his Patroness: a long laboratory was
built; and, that his labours might not be im∣peded
by any disturbance, no one was permit∣ted
to enter into it. His door was contrived
to turn round on a spring; so that, unseen, and
unseeing, his meals were conveyed to him,
without distracting the sublime contemplations
of the Sage.</P>
<P>During a residence of two years, he never
condescended to speak but two or three times
in the year to his infatuated Patroness. When
she was admitted into the Laboratory, she saw,
with pleasing astonishment, stills, immense
cauldrons, long flues, and three or four Vul∣canian
fires blazing at different corners of this
magical mine; nor did she behold with less
<PB N="197" REF="212"/>
reverence the venerable figure of the dusty
Philosopher. Pale and emaciated, with daily
operations and nightly vigils, he revealed to
her, in unintelligible jargon, his progresses:
and, having sometimes condescended to ex∣plain
the mysteries of the Arcana, she beheld,
or seemed to behold, streams of fluid, and heaps
of solid Ore, scattered around the laboratory.
Sometimes he required a new still, and some∣times,
vast quantities of lead. Already this
unfortunate lady had expended the half of her
fortune, in supplying the demands of the Phi∣losopher.
She began, now, to lower her ima∣gination
to the standard of Reason. Two
years had now elapsed, vast quantities of lead
had gone in, and nothing but lead had come
out. She disclosed her sentiments to the Philoso∣pher.
He candidly confessed, he was himself sur∣prized
at his tardy processes; but that now he
would exert himself to the utmost, and that he
would venture to perform a laborious opera∣tion
which, hitherto, he had hoped not to
<PB N="198" REF="213"/>
have been necessitated to employ. His Pa∣troness
retired, and the golden visions of Ex∣pectation
resumed all their lustre.</P>
<P>One day, as they sat at dinner, a terrible
shriek, and one crack followed by another,
loud as the report of cannon, assailed their ears.
They hastened to the laboratory: two of the
greatest Stills had burst; one part of the labo∣ratory
was in flames, and the deluded Philoso∣pher
scorched to death!</P>
<P>An Author, who wrote in the year 1704,
presents us with the following Anecdote, con∣cerning
an Alchymical speculation.</P>
<P>' The late Duke of Buckingham, being
over-persuaded by a pack of knaves, who called
themselves Chemical Operators, that they had
the secret of producing the Philosopher's Stone,
but wanted money to carry on the process; his
Grace engaged to assist them with money to
carry on the work, and performed his promise
at a vast expence. A laboratory was built,
utensils provided, and the family filled with
<PB N="199" REF="214"/>
the most famous Artists in the transmutation
of Metals—Adepts of a superior class, who
would concern themselves only about the
grand Elixir, and a pack of shabby curs, to
attend the fires, and do other servile offices;
and yet, forsooth, must be also called Philoso∣phers.</P>
<P>' This great charge continued upon the Duke
for some years; for, whoever was unpaid, or
whatever was neglected, money must be found
to bear the charge of the laboratory, and pay
the Operators; till this chimera, with other ex∣travagancies,
had caused the mortgaging and
selling many fine Manors, Lordships, Towns,
and good Farms.</P>
<P>' All this time, nothing was produced by
these sons of Art of any value; for, either the
glass broke, or the man was drunk and let
out the fire, or some other misfortune, still at∣tended
the grand process, at the time assigned
for a <HI>je ne sçai quoi</HI> to be produced, that must
turn all things to gold. The Duke encounter∣ing
<PB N="200" REF="215"/>
nothing but disappointments, and the
Operators finding themselves slighted, and
money very difficult to be had, the project
fell!'</P>
<P>Penotus, who died at ninety-eight years of
age, in the Hospital of Sierdon in Switzer∣land,
had spent nearly his whole life in re∣searches
after the Philosopher's Stone; and be∣ing,
at length, from affluent circumstances,
reduced to beggary and reason, was accustomed
to say—'That if he had a mortal enemy, that
he durst not encounter openly, he would ad∣vise
him, above all things, to give himself
up to the study and practice of Alchymy.'</P>
<P>Every philosophical mind must be convinced
that Alchymy is not an art, which some have
fancifully traced to the <HI>remotest times</HI>; it may
be rather regarded, when opposed to such a
distance of time, as a modern imposture. Caesar
commanded the treatises of Alchymy to be
burnt throughout the Roman dominions; and
this shews the opinion of one who is not less
<PB N="201" REF="216"/>
to be admired as a Philosopher than as a Mo∣narch.</P>
<P>Mr. Gibbon has this succinct passage relative
to Alchymy—'The ancient books of Alchymy,
so liberally ascribed to Pythagoras, to Solomon,
or to Hermes, were the pious frauds of more
recent adepts. The Greeks were inattentive
either to the use or the abuse of Chymistry.
In that immense Register, where Pliny has de∣posited
the discoveries, the arts, and the errors,
of mankind, there is not the least mention of
the transmutations of metals; and the perse∣cution
of Dioclesian is the first authentic event
in the history of Alchymy. The conquest of
Egypt, by the Arabs, diffused that vain science
over the globe. Congenial to the avarice of
the human heart, it was studied in China, as
in Europe, with equal eagerness and equal
success. The darkness of the middle ages en∣sured
a favourable reception to every tale of
wonder; and the revival of learning gave new
vigour to hope, and suggested more specious
<PB N="202" REF="217"/>
arts to deception. Philosophy, with the aid
of experience, has at length banished the study
of Alchymy; and the present age, however
desirous of riches, is content to seek them by
the humbler means of commerce and in∣dustry.'</P>
<P>After this, will it be credited that, even in
this enlightened age, a writer should stand
forth as it's advocate? Mr. Andrews, in his
Anecdotes, has an article concerning Alchymy.
His account of Nicholas Flamel is not accurate.
He attributes 'his mysterious prosperity to
that <HI>great secret</HI> which has been sought for
through ages, and which, <HI>to this day,</HI> has it's
<HI>believers.</HI>' Of these <HI>believers,</HI> undoubtedly, Mr.
Andrews is one!</P>

Student, who dedicated his life to the profession

<P>I cannot but wish that an <HI>Academy,</HI> or at
least a <HI>Professorship,</HI> were founded in England,
for the preservation of our language: they might
censure any faulty innovations which appeared
in the style of those compositions which were
likely to become extensive in their circulation.
They might detect the tinsel of Della Crusca,
the Gallicisms of Gibbon, and the Scotticisms
of Blair, on their earliest publication. They
would compel our Authors to be more vigi∣lant;
and we might thus be enabled to leave
our heirs the rich inheritance of a classical

style, who, in their gratitude, would recom∣pense
our labours, by delivering it down to
posterity uncontaminated.</P>
<P>Swift, and other good judges of the purity
of the English language, have testified their
desire for such an establishment; and, although
I have not forgotten the sentiments of Johnson
on this occasion, I cannot but oppose them.
Had there been such an <HI>Academy,</HI> or <HI>Professor∣ship,</HI>

<HEAD>THE STUDENT IN THE METROPOLIS.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN of Letters, who is more intent on
the acquisitions of literature than on the plots
of politics, or the speculations of commerce,
will find a deeper solitude in a populous Me∣tropolis
than if he had retreated to the seclusion
of the country. The Student, as he does not
flatter the malevolent passions of men, will not
be much incommoded with their presence. A
letter which <HI>Descartes</HI> wrote to Balzac—who,
incapable as he found his great soul to bend to
the servilities of the courtier, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to
retire from court—will illustrate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2+ letters" DISP="••…"/>ti∣ments
<PB N="208" REF="223"/>
with great force and vivacity. <HI>Descartes</HI>
then resided in the commercial city of Amster∣dam;
and thus writes to Balzac—</P>
<P>' You wish to retire; and your intention is
to seek the solitude of the Chartreux, or, pos∣sibly,
some of the most beautiful provinces of
France and Italy. I would rather advise you,
if you wish to observe mankind, and at the
same time to be plunged into the deepest soli∣tude,
to join me in Amsterdam. I prefer this
situation to that even of your delicious villa,
where I spent so great a part of the last year:
for, however agreeable a country-house may
be, a thousand little conveniences are wanted,
which can only be found in a city. One is not
alone so frequently in the country as one could
wish: a number of impertinent visitors are
continually besieging you. Here, as all the
world, except myself, is occupied in commerce,
it depends merely on myself to live unknown
to the world. I walk, every day, amongst im∣mense
ranks of people, with as much tranquil∣lity
<PB N="209" REF="224"/>
as you do in your green alleys. The men
I meet with make the same impression on my
mind as would the trees of your forests, or the
flocks of sheep grazing on your common. The
busy hum, too, of these merchants, does not
disturb one more than the purling of your
brooks. If sometimes I amuse myself in con∣templating
their anxious motions, I receive the
same pleasure which you do in observing those
men who cultivate your land; for I reflect, that
the end of all their labours is to embellish the
city which I inhabit, and to anticipate all my
wants. If you see with delight the fruits of
your orchards, which promise you such rich
crops, do you think I feel less in observing so
many fleets, that convey to me the productions
of either India? What spot on earth could you
find which, like this, can so interest your vanity,
and gratify your taste?'</P>

<HEAD>PHYSIOGNOMY AND PALMISTRY.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY one seems not a little to have studied
<HI>Lavater</HI>; so that—if the expression does not
offend—most men are ashamed to shew their
faces. Perhaps it is not generally known,
that an ancient Greek author has written on
<HI>Physiognomy.</HI> This work is translated into
Latin by the Count Charles de Montecuculli,
enriched with very learned annotations.</P>
<P>One Walfon assured George Weller, who
published his Travels into Dalmatia, Greece,
and the Levant—a very curious work—that he
had purchased a chest-full of very scarce Arabic
books; amongst which was a Treatise on Chi∣romancy,
more curious than that of John
Baptiste Porta; in which the author shews,
that the <HI>lines</HI> in the hand are <HI>letters,</HI> of which
he presents the reader with an <HI>alphabet.</HI></P>
<P>The following curious physiological definition
<PB N="211" REF="226"/>
of PHYSIOGNOMY is extracted from a Publi∣cation
by Dr. Gwither, of the year 1604—</P>
<P>' Soft wax cannot receive more various and
numerous impressions than are imprinted on a
man's face by <HI>objects</HI> moving his affections:
and not only the <HI>objects</HI> themselves have this
power, but also the very <HI>images</HI> or <HI>ideas</HI>; that
is to say, any thing that puts the animal spirits
into the same motion that the <HI>object</HI> present did,
will have the same effect with the object. To
prove the first, let one observe a man's face
looking on a pitiful object, then a ridiculous,
then a strange, then on a terrible or dangerous
object, and so forth. For the second, that <HI>ideas</HI>
have the same effect with the <HI>object,</HI> dreams
confirm too often.</P>
<P>' The manner I conceive to be thus—The
animal spirits, moved in the sensory by an
object, continue their motion to the brain;
whence the motion is propagated to this or
that particular part of the body, as is most
suitable to the design of it's creation; having
<PB N="212" REF="227"/>
first made an alteration in the <HI>face</HI> by it's
nerves, especially by the <HI>pathetic</HI> and <HI>oculorum
motorii</HI> actuating it's many muscles, as the dial∣plate
to that stupendous piece of clock-work,
which shews what is to be expected next from
the striking part. Not that I think the motion
of the spirits in the sensory continued by the
impression of the object all the way, as from
a finger to the foot: I know it too weak, though
the tenseness of the nerves favours it. But I
conceive it done in the medulla of the brain,
where is the common stock of spirits; as in an
organ, whose pipes being uncovered, the air
rushes into them; but the keys, let go, are
stopped again. Now, if by repeated acts, or
frequent entertaining of the ideas of a favourite
idea of a passion or vice which natural tem∣perament
has hurried one to, or custom dragged,
the <HI>face</HI> is so often put into that posture which
attends such acts, that the animal spirits find
such latent passages into it's nerves, that it is
sometimes unalterably set: as the <HI>Indian</HI> Re∣ligious
<PB N="213" REF="228"/>
are, by long continuing in strange
postures in their <HI>Pagods.</HI> But, most commonly,
such a habit is contracted, that it falls insensibly
into that posture, when some present object
does not obliterate that more natural impression
by a new, or dissimulation hide it.</P>
<P>' Hence it is that we see great <HI>drinkers</HI> with
<HI>eyes</HI> generally set towards the nose, the adducent
muscles being often employed to let them see
their loved liquor in the glass at the time of
drinking; which were, therefore, called <HI>bibi∣tory.
Lascivious persons</HI> are remarkable for the
<HI>Oculorum Mobilis Petulanta,</HI> as Petronius calls
it. From this also we may solve the <HI>Quaker's</HI>
expecting face, waiting the pretended Spi∣rit;
and the melancholy face of the <HI>Sectaries</HI>;
the <HI>studious</HI> face of men of great application of
mind; revengeful and <HI>bloody men,</HI> like execu∣tioners
in the act: and though silence, in a
sort, may awhile pass for wisdom, yet, sooner
or later, Saint Martin peeps through the dis∣guise,
to undo all. A <HI>changeable face</HI> I have
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>
observed to shew a <HI>changeable mind.</HI> But I
would by no means have what has been said
understood as without exception; for I doubt
not but sometimes there are found men with
great and virtuous souls under very unpro∣mising
outsides.'</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTERS DESCRIBED BY MUSICAL
NOTES.</HEAD>
<P>THE present communication is made by an
ingenious young friend. It is an Extract from
a Volume of 'Philosophical Transactions and
Collections,' published at the end of the year
1700; and the curious conjectures it contains,
being perfectly novel to me—my friend ob∣serves—may, perhaps, be so to you and many
others.</P>
<P>The idea of describing characters under the
names of Musical Instruments, has been al∣ready
displayed. The two most pleasing Pa∣pers
which embellish the <HI>Tatler,</HI> are written
by Addison. He there dwells on this idea
<PB N="215" REF="230"/>
with uncommon success; and it has been ap∣plauded
for it's <HI>originality.</HI> Let it, however,
be recollected, that the following Paper was
published in the year 1700, and the two
Numbers of Addison in the year 1710. It is
probable, that this inimitable Writer borrowed
his ideas from this Work. In the general Pre∣face
to the Tatler, his Papers on this similar
subject are distinguished for their felicity of
imagination.</P>
<P>' A conjecture at dispositions from the mo∣dulations
of the voice.</P>
<P>' Sitting in some company, and having been,
but a little before, musical, I chanced to take
notice, that, in ordinary discourse, <HI>words</HI> were
spoken in perfect <HI>notes</HI>; and that some of the
company used <HI>eighths,</HI> some <HI>fifths,</HI> some <HI>thirds</HI>;
and that his discourse which was most pleasing,
his <HI>words,</HI> as to their tone, consisted most of
<HI>concords,</HI> and were of <HI>discords</HI> of such as made
up harmony. The same person was the most
affable, pleasant, and best-natured, in the com∣pany.
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>
This suggests a reason, why many dis∣courses,
which one <HI>hears</HI> with much pleasure,
when they come to be <HI>read,</HI> scarce seem the
same things.</P>
<P>' From this difference of MUSIC in SPEECH,
we may conjecture that of TEMPERS. We
know the Doric mood sounds gravity and so∣briety;
the Lydian, buxomness and freedom;
the Aeolic, sweet stilness and quiet composure;
the Phrygian, jollity and youthful levity; the
Ionic is a stiller of storms and disturbances aris∣ing
from passion. And why may we not rea∣sonably
suppose, that those whose speech natu∣rally
runs into the notes peculiar to any of
these moods, are likewise, in nature, hereunto
congenerous? <HI>C Fa ut,</HI> may shew me to be of
an ordinary capacity, though good disposition.
<HI>G Sol re ut,</HI> to be peevish and effeminate. <HI>Flats,</HI>
a manly or melancholic sadness. He who hath
a voice which will, in some measure, agree with
all <HI>cliffs,</HI> to be of good parts, and fit for variety
of employments, yet somewhat of an inconstant
<PB N="217" REF="232"/>
nature. Likewise from the TIMES: so <HI>semi-briefs,</HI>
may speak a temper dull and phlegma∣tic;
<HI>minums,</HI> grave and serious; <HI>crotchets,</HI> a
prompt wit; <HI>quavers,</HI> vehemency of passion,
and scolds use them. <HI>Semi-brief-rest,</HI> may de∣note
one either stupid, or fuller of thoughts
than he can utter; <HI>minum-rest,</HI> one that deli∣berates;
<HI>crotchet-rest,</HI> one in a passion. So
that, from the natural use of MOOD, NOTE,
and TIME, we may collect DISPOSITIONS.'</P>

<HEAD>SCRIPTURE EXPRESSIONS DERIVED FROM
CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>IT was an ancient ceremony of the Jews,
which yet is religiously observed amongst
them, to tear their cloaths in mourning and
affliction. Some Orientals still practise this
custom, when any thing uncommonly distress∣ful
happens. The Jews make use of much
ceremony on this occasion—Sometimes, they
tear from the top to the bottom; and some∣times,
<PB N="218" REF="233"/>
from the bottom to the top. The rent
must be of a particular length. When it is
done for the loss of parents, it is never sewed;
for the loss of other persons, it is sewed at the
end of thirty days. This piece of religious
mummery, if it is of no other value, will at
least serve to explain a passage, in which Solo∣mon,
in his Proverbs, says, that '<HI>There is a time
to rend, and a time to sew.</HI>' Which means,
there is a time for affliction, and a time for
consolation. Many of the Scripture-phrases,
that appear unintelligible, are founded on
Jewish customs.</P>
<P>Mr. Bruce, in his Travels, observed in a ca∣valcade,
the head-dress of the Governors of
Provinces. A large broad fillet was bound
upon their forehead, and tied behind their
head. In the middle of this was a HORN, or a
conical piece of silver, gilt, much in the shape
of our candle-extinguishers. This is called
<HI>Kirn,</HI> or <HI>Horn,</HI> and is only worn in reviews,
or public rejoicings for victory. This custom,
<PB N="219" REF="234"/>
borrowed from the Hebrews, our Traveller
conceives, will explain the several allusions
made to it in Scripture. 'I said unto fools,
deal not foolishly; and to the wicked, lift not
up the HORN—Lift not up your HORN on
high; speak not with a stiff neck—But my
HORN shalt thou exalt like the horn of an
unicorn—And the HORN of the righteous
shall be exalted with honour.' And thus in
many other places throughout the Psalms.</P>

<HEAD>A VISIONARY's BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>I GIVE the singular title of a Work, which
is looked upon as the most extravagant
production that has ever been published. It
has given birth to a great number of disserta∣tions

it's Author. The last alone seems to have been
discovered, who confesses he neither knew to

<P>Among the great number of writers who
have attempted to discover the sense of the
Enigmas, and the foolish and extravagant Vi∣sions
with which this Work is loaded, there
have been some, who imagined that they per∣ceived
many remarkable events, which were
predicted in this Book. Others have led their
<PB N="221" REF="236"/>
imagination to behold it in another point of
view; and there have been even Chymists,
who have pretended to say, that the great se∣cret
of the Philosophical Stone was there con∣cealed
under mysterious phrases.</P>
<P>' If it is difficult'—says De Bure—'to give
a just idea of this extravagant Work, it is,
however, more easy to inform the reader of
it's rarity. It has been long known amongst
the Literary <HI>Connoisseurs</HI>; and it is certain,
that nothing is more difficult than to find a
compleat copy. Some curious Collectors have
endeavoured, by sacrificing a great number of
copies, to join it's separate parts; but they
have always found their endeavours frustrated.
This mysterious Work seems to have a myste∣rious
conclusion.</P>
<P>This rare Volume Consists—according to
the most compleat Copy extant—of one hun∣dred
and three fugitive and separate Pieces,
which the Author caused, himself, to have
<PB N="222" REF="237"/>
printed, and which he distributed, himself, in
streets, and houses, to those persons who made
him some pecuniary present, as he himself in∣forms
us, by the acknowledgments which he
makes in some of his pieces; where he puts
not only the name and the quality of those to
whom he presented them, but also the sums
which he received from each individual.'</P>
<P>The Abbé Ladvocat has given the following
succinct account of this man—'He knew the
art of gaining his livelihood by distributing his
extravagancies to whoever he found was will∣ing
to purchase them. They contain orations,
sentences, but more frequently prophecies.
Many have ill-spent their time in explaining
the mysteries of his work; and, as is usual in
these cases, every one found what he sought:
but the truth is, they are visions which come
from a head less ridiculous than those of the
persons who received them with respect, and
recompensed them with their money, unless
<PB N="223" REF="238"/>
they were guided to act thus by the benevolence
of Charity.'</P>
<P>After what has been laid before the reader,
will it be believed that a compleat collection of
the Comte de Permission's absurdities would
fetch a very high price among a certain class
of <HI>Literati?</HI> It happens, however, that his
<HI>leaves,</HI> which resemble in their design those of
the Roman <HI>Sybils,</HI> are as difficult to be found.
There are men who display a rich fund of

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>IMPOSITIONS OF AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE have been some Authors who have
practised singular Impositions on the public.
Varillas, the French Historian, enjoyed for
some time a great reputation in his own coun∣try
for his Historic Compositions. When they
<PB N="224" REF="239"/>
became more known, the scholars of other
countries destroyed the reputation he had un∣justly
acquired. 'His continual professions
of sincerity prejudiced many in his favour,
and made him pass for a writer who had pene∣trated
into the inmost recesses of the cabinet:
but the public were at length undeceived, and
were convinced that the Historical Anecdotes,
which Varillas put off for authentic facts, had
no foundation, being wholly his own invent∣ing!—though he endeavoured to make them
pass for realities, by affected citations of titles,
instructions, letters, memoirs, and relations, all
of them imaginary!'</P>
<P>Melchisedec Thevenot, Librarian to the
French king, was never out of Europe; yet
he has composed some folio volumes of his
'Voyages and Travels,' by information and
memoirs, which he collected from those who
had travelled. 'Travels,' observes the Com∣piler
of the Biographical Dictionary, 'related
at second hand, can never be of any great au∣thority
<PB N="225" REF="240"/>
or moment.' Assuredly not; but they
may be pregnant with errors of all kinds.</P>
<P>Gemelli Carreri, a Neapolitan gentleman,
who, for many years, never quitted his cham∣ber,
being confined by a tedious indisposition,
amused himself with writing a voyage round
the world; giving characters of Men, and de∣scriptions
of Countries, as if he had really
visited them. Du Halde, who has written so
voluminous an account of China, compiled it
from the Memoirs of the Missionaries, and
never travelled ten leagues from Pairs in his
life; though he appears, by his writings, to
be very familiar with the Chinese scenery.</P>
<P>This is an excellent observation of an ano∣nymous
Author. '<HI>Writers</HI> who never visited
foreign countries, and <HI>Travellers</HI> who have
run through immense regions with fleeting
pace, have given us long accounts of various
Countries and People; evidently collected from
the idle reports and absurd traditions of the
ignorant vulgar, from whom only they could
<PB N="226" REF="241"/>
have received those relations which we see
accumulated with such undiscerning credu∣lity.'</P>

<HEAD>TRANSLATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following observations on <HI>Translation</HI>
are offered to our modern <HI>doers into English.</HI>
To whom I am indebted for this article, has
escaped my recollection.</P>
<P>To render a <HI>Translation</HI> perfect, it is neces∣sary
to attend to these rules.—The Translator
must possess a thorough knowledge of the two
Languages. He must be exact, not only in
giving the thoughts of his Author, but even
his own words, when they become essential and
necessary. He must preserve the spirit and pe∣culiar
genius of his Author. He must distin∣guish
every character by it's manners and it's
nature, by unfolding the senfe and the words
with suitable phrases and parallel expressions.
He must yield beauties by other beauties, and
<PB N="227" REF="242"/>
figures by other figures, whenever the idiom
of Language does not admit of a close version.
He must not employ long Sentences, unless
they serve to render the sense more intelligible,
and the diction more elegant. He must at∣tempt
a neatness in his manner; and, to ef∣fect
this, he must know skilfully to contract or
enlarge his Periods. He must unite the too
concise Sentences of his Author, if his style,
like that of Tacitus, be close and abrupt. He
must not only sedulously attempt precision
and purity of diction, but he must strive also
to embellish his version with those graces and
images which frequently lie so closely hidden,
that nothing but a familiar conversancy with
his Author can discover them. And, lastly, he
must present us with the sentiments of his
Author, without a servile attachment to his
words or phrases, but rather, according to his
spirit and his genius.</P>
<P>A Translator is a Painter who labours after
an original. He must carefully reveal the <HI>traits</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="243"/>
of his model. He copies, he does not com∣pose.
Whenever he trespasses on his limits, he
ceases to be a <HI>Translator,</HI> and becomes an
<HI>Author.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF NEWSPAPERS AND PERIO∣DICAL
LITERATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Newspapers of the present day, con∣trasted
with their original models, have attain∣ed
a degree of excellence which is flattering
to modern industry to contemplate. While
political events are registered with a celerity
unknown to our ancestors, the sentiments of
liberty are disseminated in the warm impres∣sion
of the moment. The frivolous pursuits
of the age offer an ample field to those who
can point with force the keenness of Ridicule.
Fashion, however versatile, cannot escape the
eye of the satirist; and the follies of the night
are chronicled for the sober contemplation of
the morning. Literature has been called in to
<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
embellish these diurnal pages; and it has given
a stability and perfection of which the evanes∣cent
nature of such productions was hardly
thought susceptible. It is, however, a melan∣choly
truth, that such excellent purposes have
been frustrated by a vile spirit of faction; a
spirit that, according to the sensible <HI>Rapin,</HI>
will sooner overturn the English Constitution
than the united efforts of our most powerful
enemies. But such discussions we leave to the
sagacious politicians.</P>
<P>Periodical Papers seem first to have been
used by the English during the Civil Wars of
the usurper Cromwell, to disseminate amongst
the people the sentiments of Loyalty or Rebel∣lion,
according as their Authors were disposed.
We seem to have been obliged to the Italians
for the idea; and, perhaps, it was their <HI>Ga∣zettas</HI>—from <HI>Gazzera,</HI> a magpie or chatter∣er—which have given a name to these Pa∣pers.
Honest <HI>Peter Heylin,</HI> in the preface to
his <HI>Cosmography,</HI> mentions that—'the affairs
of each Town, or War, were better pre∣sented
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
to the reader in the <HI>Weekly News-Books.</HI>'
In their origin they were solely devoted to
political purposes: but they soon became a
public nuisance, by serving as receptacles
of party malice, and echoing to the farthest
ends of the kingdom the insolent voice of Fac∣tion.
They set the minds of Men more at va∣riance,
enflamed their tempers to a greater
fierceness, and gave a keener edge to the sharp∣ness
of civil discord.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, that such works will
always find writers adapted to their scurrilous
purposes; but of a vast crowd that issued from
the press, though little more than a century
has elapsed, they are now not to be found but
in a few private Collections. They form a
race of Authors unknown to most readers of
these times: the name of their Chief, however,
has just reached us, but is on the point of
disappearing.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Roger L'Estrange,</HI> who appears to have
greatly surpassed his rivals, and to have been
<PB N="231" REF="246"/>
esteemed as the most perfect model of political
writing, merits little praise. The temper of
the man was factious and brutal, and the com∣positions
of the Author very indifferent. In
his multifarious productions, and meagre
translations, we discover nothing that indicates
one amiable sentiment, to compensate for a
barbarous diction, and a heavy load of poli∣tical
trash. His attempts at Wit are clumsy
exertions; the aukward efforts of a German
who labours on a delicate toy. When he as∣sumes
the gravity of the sage, he seems more
fortunate in extorting a laugh; burlesquing
the most solemn reflections by quaint and un∣couth
expression.</P>
<P>In the reign of <HI>Queen Anne</HI>—not unjustly
characterized by being distinguished as the
Augustan Age of English Literature—Periodi∣cal
Prints, that till then had only served po∣litical
purposes, began to rank higher in the
estimation of the Public. Some had already
attempted to introduce literary subjects, and
<PB N="232" REF="247"/>
other topics of a more general speculation. But
we see nothing that has escaped the waste of
time, till <HI>Sir Richard Steele</HI> formed the plan
of his <HI>Tatler.</HI> He designed it to embrace the
three provinces, of Manners, of Letters, and
of Politics. He knew that this was an in∣valuable
improvement; and, doubtless, he
thought, that if the last portion could be omit∣ted,
it would still have made it more perfect.
But violent and sudden reformation is sel∣dom
to be used; and the Public were to be
conducted insensibly into so new and different
a track from that to which they had been
hitherto accustomed. Hence Politics were ad∣mitted
into his Paper. But it remained for the
chaster genius of <HI>Addison</HI> to banish this disa∣greeable
topic from his elegant pages. The
writer in Polite Letters felt himself degraded
by sinking into the dull narrator of Political
Events. It is from this time, that Newspapers
and periodical Literature became distinct
works.</P>

<PB N="233" REF="248"/>
<HEAD>LITERARY COMPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>IN a little Tract, printed in 1681, is to be
found some curious literary information. The
ingenious author attempts to mark out the
most profitable way of reading and writing
books. He first informs us of various vo∣luminous
writers; of some, so infected with
the <HI>cacoethes scribendi,</HI> that they have composed
from six to seven thousand volumes! He then
notices vast libraries; such as that of Ptolomy,
King of Egypt, which was said to contain
four hundred thousand; or, as others write,
seven hundred thousand volumes: and also that
of the younger Theodosius at Constantinople,
containing ten myriads of books.</P>
<P>He reflects that, since the invention of print∣ing,
an Author can publish as much in <HI>one day</HI>
as he has composed in <HI>one year.</HI> He laments,
that these multifarious volumes may prove pre∣judicial
<PB N="234" REF="249"/>
to the Student; that such a continued
novelty of matter will render his knowledge
less clear and digested than before this inven∣tion
took place: though he is willing to allow
that this evil originates rather from the ill use
made of books, than from their number.</P>
<P>He complains—a complaint, I fear, which
must ever exist—that the press is continually
pouring forth trivial, crude, and useless per∣formances:
yet he observes—'If men would
take care that ill books be not written, and that
good books be not ill written, but that in their
composition a due regard be always had to
<HI>prudence, solidity, perspicuity,</HI> and <HI>brevity,</HI> there
would be no cause left for us to complain of
the too great number of books.'</P>
<P>By the idea of <HI>prudence,</HI> he would have us
understand, that an Author should never rashly
or inconsiderately apply himself to composi∣tion:
let him learn well what he purposes to
teach to others. The greatest Scholars have
always taken time to make their compositions
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
approach perfection. Isocrates spent ten, or,
as some will have it, fifteen years, in polishing
one Panegyric. Dion Cassius employed twelve
years in writing his History, and ten years in
preparing his Memoirs. Virgil employed se∣ven
years to finish his Bucolics; and, after a
labour of eleven years, pronounced his Aeneid
imperfect. Jacobus Sannazarius wrote three
books <HI>de Partu Virginis,</HI> and dedicated twenty
years to this labour. Diodorus Siculus was
thirty years in composing his History. Hence
he advises writers to reflect on the reply of
Zeuxis to one who boasted of a more fluent
hand in painting—<HI>Diu pingo, quia eternitati
pingo</HI>—'I paint but a line every day; but I
paint for posterity.'</P>
<P>In works of importance, he would have us
be studious of what he calls <HI>solidity.</HI> He means,
that our arguments should be forcibly urged,
and skilfully applied; that every thing we
write tend to shew that we feel ourselves the
conviction of what we would convince our
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
reader; that nothing be feeble, doubtful, or
frivolous; that truth be firm, clear, and as in∣disputable
as possible. 'Not,' as he candidly
remarks, 'that this <HI>solidity</HI> can be every where
observed alike, it being above the infirmity of
man so to do; but men should be very wary
not to flatter themselves that others will be∣lieve
their bare say-so's.'</P>
<P>By <HI>perspicuity,</HI> he requires that the style
serve like a mirror to the mind of the Author;
so that the sense may be lucidly presented to
the reader. As for those Authors who are
pleased to throw over their compositions an
affected obscurity, he shrewdly remarks, that
they might gratify their humour and the
world much better by remaining silent.</P>
<P>Lastly, he would not have <HI>perspicuity</HI> so far
indulged as to neglect <HI>brevity.</HI> 'For, as ob∣scurity
makes a book useless; so, if drawn out
in length, it becomes tedious.' To observe
this <HI>brevity,</HI> he advises the writer not to give
into wild digressions, but always 'to keep close
<PB N="237" REF="252"/>
to his main subject;' to reject, as much as
possible, trite sentiments and familiar argu∣ments;
to be sparing of an idle amplification
of words; and, in controversy, not so much to
combat his adversaries by number as by weight
of argument.</P>
<P>To close this slight Review, which, I hope,
will not be found unuseful, he exhorts the in∣genuous
youth not to delight in a multiplicity
of authors; to be select in his choice, and then
studiously to unite himself to those authors
whom he finds most congenial to his own dis∣positions.
An excellent rule this! And, to
conclude with a verse from the Earl of Ros∣common—<Q>To chuse an Author as he would a Friend.</Q></P>
<P>For the benefit of young Authors, I will add
the advice of a Veteran on Publication—</P>
<P>Menage observes, that the works which are
most <HI>generally</HI> liked, give a more extensive re∣putation
than the most excellent ones, which
<PB N="238" REF="253"/>
are only relished by a few connoisseurs. The
dishes at a feast should rather be seasoned to the
taste of the invited than to that of the cooks,
however able they may be: for, as Martial
says—<Q><L>— Coenae fercula nostrae</L>
<L>Malim Convivis, quam placuisse Cocis.</L></Q></P>
<P>To give a work which may be crowned with
the approbation of the public, it must be read
<HI>three times:</HI> the first, perfectly to understand
it; the second, to criticise it; and the third, to
correct it.</P>

<HEAD>VIRGIL.</HEAD>
<P>VIRGIL has violated the immutable laws
of common sense, which exist in full force in
all ages, and in all countries, by his ridiculous
Miracles, which are not less insupportable than
those which the ancient Chroniclers relate of
their Saints. Among these, we may observe,
<PB N="239" REF="254"/>
is that of transforming into the Leaves of a
Tree, of which Polydore is the Root, the Lances
with which Polymnestor had pierced him in
the third book of the Aeneid; in making the
branch of a tree produce a Golden Bough, in
the sixth; and in metamorphosing into Sea
Nymphs, in the eleventh book, the Ships of
Aeneas, which were set on fire. The least ju∣dicious
of his admirers would even defend
these miracles: surely, these fictions are
not miraculous, but ridiculous, and only serve
to blemish so beautiful a composition!</P>
<P>We must also condemn, in Virgil, that cruel
Piety by which he has distinguished Aeneas, in
causing him to immolate eight persons on the
funeral-pile of Pallas. The example of Homer,
which he has here followed, cannot excuse a
barbarity which shocks our feelings. This
cruel action was characteristic of the furious
Achilles in the circumstance of the death of
Patroclus, but should not have been performed
by the pious Aeneas. Besides, Virgil, who
<PB N="240" REF="255"/>
had more judgment than Homer, and who
lived in a more polished age, is less excuseable
in having made his Hero commit so barbarous
an action.</P>
<P>In the fourth book of the Aeneid, we are
compelled to animadvert on another sault,
which pains our sensibility. In that book,
where the Poet expresses so well the madness
of a despairing Lover, Aeneas appears by much
too cold; and his excuses are, indeed, not very
ingenious for his desertion of Dido—in a word,
not a little unfeeling. To all the reproaches
of the passionate and tender Queen he has
only to oppose the orders of Jupiter, and the
severity of his sate. He cannot doubt of the
extreme violence of her passion; and he must
necessarily know to what an excess a woman
of her fervid spirit, who pretended to be united
to him as his wife, would carry it: yet he <HI>sleeps,</HI>
in the most perfect tranquillity, in his vessel,
till Mercury awakens him.</P>
<P>Some of his adventures seem copies of each
<PB N="241" REF="256"/>
other. Sinon and Acheminedes present them∣selves
to the Trojans on two very different
occasions, but in nearly a similar manner.
The one in his second book, and the other in
the third, say the same things. The descrip∣tions
of the tempests too frequently resemble
each other; and they begin two or three times
by the same verses. This beautiful verse—<Q>Obstupui, Steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit,</Q>
is too often repeated. There are also <HI>contra∣dictions</HI>;
which, probably, he would have cor∣rected,
had he lived.</P>
<P>He relates, in the fifth book, the circum∣stances
of the death of Palinurus in one man∣ner;
and Palinurus himself, in the sixth, re∣lates
it differently. In one, it is the god of
Sleep, under the figure of Phorbas, who hav∣ing
caused the pilot to fall asleep, precipitates
him and the rudder into the sea; in the other,
it is a gale of wind that carries them both
<PB N="242" REF="257"/>
away. In one place, Palinurus is swallowed
up in a profound sleep by the sea; in the other,
he is perfectly awake, and has time to reflect
that the ship will now wander without a pilot.</P>
<P>Virgil should not have caused Aeneas to re∣turn
from Hell by the gate of <HI>Ivory,</HI> but by
that of <HI>Horn.</HI> By employing here the gate of
Ivory, from whence issued fables and fictions,
formed at pleasure—<HI>Sed falsa ad Coelum mittunt
insomnia manes</HI>—is it not destroying, at a single
stroke, the whole that he has been recounting in
that incomparable book; and tacitly informing
Augustus, that all he had imagined most flat∣tering
for him and his anceftors is nothing but
a mere idle fiction?</P>
<P>In the second book of the Aeneid, Ascanius
appears a little child, led by the hand of his
father: he could not have attained to more
than seven years. In the third, Andromache,
calling to mind Astyanax her son, and addres∣sing
herself to Ascanius, says—'Were he
<PB N="243" REF="258"/>
living, he would now, like you, have reached
the age of puberty—<Q>Et nunc aequali tecum pubesceret oevo.</Q></P>
<P>Ascanius was not, then, a child, before he
went to Africa? Yet Virgil makes him again
but seven years in his fourth book, when Dido
holds Cupid in her lap, who had assumed his
figure: yet, in the <HI>very same book,</HI> he is repre∣sented,
not as a <HI>child,</HI> but as a young and vi∣gorous
<HI>man,</HI> in a hunting-match, of which he
gives a description.</P>
<P>These things are very irregular and dissimi∣lar:
contradictions which are very material,
and which cannot be reconciled. Virgil, on
his death-bed, commanded his friends to burn
his Aeneid. The great Poet was conscious
of it's unfinished state. Fortunately for poste∣rity,
they did not in this respect obey the
injunctions of their dying friend. The loss had,
indeed, been irreparable.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="259"/>
Let it not be considered, that I have collected
these criticisms to diminish the reputation of Vir∣gil.
His laurels are placed for above the reach of
envy. I am no Lauder; no Heron; but it is alone
by an enlightened criticism, and by contemplat∣ing
the errors of our Masters, that we may
hope, if we but faintly attain to their beauties,
at least to escape from their errors.</P>
<P>We can, however, defend Virgil from a
censure which attacks at once the Poet and the
Man. The Cardinal Sirlet, Turnebus, Muret,
Taubman, Julius Scaliger, and others not less
eminent, are much astonished that Virgil, in
his sixth book of the Aeneid, describing the
Laurel Grove which he has assigned for the
residence of the Poets, makes no mention
of Homer. On this they have taxed Virgil
with ingratitude and envy; since here an oc∣casion
presented itself so favourably to bestow
a beautiful eulogium on Homer, to whom he
stood so deeply indebted; and they have been
astonished why he preferred to do this honour
<PB N="245" REF="260"/>
to the ancient Musaeus. But this censure is
very unjust, and could only be occasioned by
not reflecting sufficiently on the order of time.
Let us consider, that Virgil only follows his
Hero: if he speaks of Musaeus, it is that he
had no other design but to mention those
Poets who died before the taking of Troy.
He was too judicious, to cause Aeneas to relate
that he had seen Homer amongst the Poets,
who was not born till at least one hundred and
sixty years after the destruction of Troy.</P>
<P>Virgil, in the second book of the Georgics,
has bestowed high eulogiums on the fertile
territory of Nole, in Campania: but, the inha∣bitants
of this city not chusing to allow their
waters to run through his lands, he erased
<HI>Nole,</HI> and put <HI>Ora</HI> in it's place. So dreadful
is the vengeance of a Poet!</P>
<P>The Banquet which Alcinous gives Ulysses,
in the Odyssey, is very beautiful, and perfectly
gallant: but it appears there are none but men
present. That with which Dido entertains
<PB N="246" REF="261"/>
Aeneas is not by any means comparable to it in
festal elegance. In one, they sing the adven∣tures
of the Gods, and other themes, not less
agreeable than gallant: in the other, they sing
concerning the stars, and other philosophical
matters. Let the festive splendours of Al∣cinous
be removed to the Court of Carthage,
and the feast of Dido to the Pheacian Island;
and every thing will then be in character.</P>
<P>To this article may be added an account of a
thirteenth book of the Aeneid. A Poet, named
<HI>Maphaeus Vegius Laudanensis</HI>—so Naudé writes
it, but I observe his Commentator tells us it
should be <HI>Laudensis</HI>—was born at Lodi, in the
year 1407. At sixteen years of age, he gave
evident marks of an excellent genius. What
is most remarkable of him, is, that he has with
great felicity added a thirteenth book to the
Aeneid. Has this book ever been translated
into English verse?</P>

<HEAD>MILTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is painful to observe the acrimony which
the most eminent Scholars infuse frequently
in their controversial writings. The polite∣ness
of the present times has, in some degree,
softened the malignity of the Man in the dig∣nity
of the Author; though it must be con∣fessed
there are living writers who pride them∣selves
on being—as they express it—of the
Warburtonian School; but who display the
asperity rather than the erudition of a War∣burton.</P>
<P>The celebrated controversy of <HI>Salmasius</HI> and
<HI>Milton</HI>—the first, the advocate of King Charles;
the other, the defender of the People—was of
that magnitude, that all Europe took a part in
the paper-war of these two great men. The
answer of Milton, who perfectly massacred
Salmasius, is now read but by the few. What∣ever
is addressed to the times, however great
<PB N="248" REF="263"/>
may be it's merit, is doomed to perish with
the times; yet, on these Pages, the Philoso∣pher
will not contemplate in vain.</P>
<P>It will form no uninteresting article to ga∣ther
a few of the rhetorical <HI>weeds</HI>—for <HI>flowers</HI>
we cannot well call them—with which they
mutually presented each other. Their rancour
was at least equal to their condition, though
they were the two most learned Scholars of a
learned Age.</P>
<P>That the deformity of the body is an idea
we attach to the deformity of the mind, the
vulgar must acknowledge; but surely it is un∣pardonable
in the enlightened Philosopher thus
to compare corporeal matter with intellectual
spirit: yet Milbourne and Dennis—the last a
formidable Critic—have frequently considered,
that comparing Dryden and Pope to what∣ever
the eye turned from with disgust, was
very good argument to lower their literary
abilities. Salmasius seems also to have enter∣tained
this idea, though his spies in England
<PB N="249" REF="264"/>
gave him wrong information; or, possibly, he
only drew the figure of his own distempered
imagination.</P>
<P>Salmasius sometimes reproaches Milton, as
being but a puny piece of Man; a dwarf de∣prived
of the human figure; a being compos∣ed
of nothing but skin and bone; a contemp∣tible
pedagogue, fit only to flog his boys: and
sometimes elevating the ardour of his mind
into a poetic frenzy, he applies to him these
words of Virgil—'<HI>Monstrum horrendum, in∣forme,
ingens, cui lumen ademptum.</HI>' Our
great Poet thought this senseless declamation
merited a serious refutation; perhaps he did
not wish to appear despicable in the eyes of
the Ladies. If the great Johnson could ex∣press
his pleasure at learning that Milton wore
latchets to his shoes, his admirers must be in∣terested
in this description of himself. He says,
that he does not think any one ever considered
him as unbeautiful; that his size rather ap∣proached
mediocrity than the diminutive; that he
<PB N="250" REF="265"/>
still felt the same courage and the same strength
which he possessed when young, when, with
his sword, he felt no difficulty to combat with
men more robust than himself; that his face,
far from being pale, emaciated, and wrinkled,
did him much credit; for though he had pas∣sed
his fortieth year, he was in all other re∣spects
ten years younger. For all this he cal∣led
for testimony on multitudes; who, though
they knew him but by sight, would hold him
ridiculous if he did not reveal the truth.</P>
<P>Morus, in his Epistle Dedicatory of his
<HI>Clamor Regii Sanguinis,</HI> compares Milton to a
Hangman: his disordered vision to the blind∣ness
of his soul; and vomits forth so much
rancour and venom, that to collect his calum∣nies
ceases to become an amusive employ∣ment.</P>
<P>When Salmasius found that his strictures
on the person of Milton were false, and that,
on the contrary, it was uncommonly beautiful,
he then turned his battery against those graces
<PB N="251" REF="266"/>
with which Nature had so liberally adorned his
adversary. And it is now that he seems to
have set no restrictions to his pen; but, rag∣ing
with the irritation of Milton's success, he
throws out the blackest calumnies, and the
most infamous aspersions.</P>
<P>It must be observed, when Milton first pro∣posed
to answer Salmasius, he had lost the use
of one of his eyes; and his physicians declar∣ed,
that if he applied himself to the contro∣versy,
the other would likewise close for ever!
His patriotism was not to be baffled but with
life itself. Unhappily, the prediction of his
physicians took place! Thus a learned man,
in the occupations of study, falls blind; a
circumstance which even now agonizes the
heart of Sensibility. Salmasius considers it as
one from which he may draw caustic ridicule,
and satiric severity.</P>
<P>Salmasius glories that Milton lost his health
and his eyes in answering his apology for
King Charles! He does not now reproach him
<PB N="252" REF="267"/>
with natural deformities; but he malignantly
sympathizes with him, that he now no more is
in possession of that beauty which rendered
him so amiable during his residence in <HI>Italy.</HI>
He speaks more plainly in a following page;
and, in a word, would blacken the austere
virtue of Milton with a crime too infamous to
name.</P>
<P>Impartiality of Criticism obliges us to con∣fess,
that Milton was not destitute of rancour.
And, when it was told him that his adversary
boasted he had occasioned the loss of his eyes,
he answered, with the ferocity of the irritated
Puritan—'<HI>And I shall cost him his life!</HI>' A
prediction which was soon after verified: for
Christina, Queen of Sweden, withdrew her
patronage from Salmasius, and sided with
Milton. The universal neglect the proud Scho∣lar
felt, in consequence, hastened his death.</P>
<P>The story of his expulsion from Cambridge
was not forgotten—nor forgotten to be aggra∣vated.
Milton denies this, and relates it in a
<PB N="253" REF="268"/>
manner honourable to himself. Salmasius as∣sures
his reader, that those who well knew
Milton affirm, that he was incapable of Latin
composition; but—in his manner of raillery—he confesses Milton to be an extraordinary Poet;
and this he maintains by pointing out how fre∣quently
he violates, in his Latin verses, the
laws of quantity. He adds, that the Author
might have spared himself the pains of indi∣cating
his Age; for, without this aid, his
reader must have been convinced that they
were the compositions of the raw Scholar. To
close the virulence of his invectives, he tells
us, that Milton's book is written by a French
schoolmaster in London, and that he only lent
his name.</P>
<P>What Patin writes in his Letters, in the
same times, will shew what lame reports the
enemies of Milton helped about. He writes—'Monsieur de la Mothe le Vaier informs me,
that the book of Milton against the King of
England has been burnt by the common
<PB N="254" REF="269"/>
hangman—in Paris: that Milton is in prison;
and, it is to be hoped, will be hung. Some
say that Milton wrote this Book in English;
and that a Peter de Moulin, who has put it in∣to
such fine Latin, is in danger, for his pains,
of being burnt.' This is in the usual style of
Patin's correspondence; some truth, with much
fiction. Moulin was a Confessor of the Royal
party; and was, on the contrary, a favourite
with our second Charles; and who, having
written against the Rebels, was one of the few
whose fidelity he rewarded.</P>
<P>It is raking in offals to transcribe from the
infamous <HI>Lauder.</HI> His virulence, however,
cannot now irritate; it may amuse. He seems
to have poached in Salmasius for Epithets.
His Pamphlets, with the common lyes of the
day, have met the common fate. The present
paragraph is an odd mixture of pedantry, of
vile composition, and viler abuse.</P>
<P>' Milton, whom the present generation of
Writers, if they do not on some occasions
<PB N="255" REF="270"/>
<HI>exeem</HI> from some human frailties and imper∣fections,
have yet in the main conspired to
daub with the <HI>untempered mortar</HI> of <HI>unbound∣ed</HI>
praise. By representing him as all perfect,
all excellent, without the least mixture of alloy,
was rather <HI>a devil</HI> incarnate: an abandoned
<HI>Monster</HI> of mankind, of insatiable <HI>avarice,</HI> un∣bounded
<HI>ambition,</HI> implacable <HI>malice,</HI> unparal∣leled
<HI>impudence,</HI> and shocking <HI>impiety.</HI>" Such
is the declamation which <HI>Lauder,</HI> in the pre∣sent
day, had the audacity to acknowledge as
his own composition.</P>
<P>We will close this Article with Bayle's Re∣view
of Milton's Controversial Latin Writings,
for of no others he pretended to judge.
'Milton is very expert in the Latin language.
No one can deny that his style is flowing,
animated, and flowery; and that he has de∣fended
the people adroitly and ingeniously.
But, without entering too deeply into this sub∣ject,
it must be confessed, that his manner is
exceptionable; it is not sufficiently serious for
<PB N="256" REF="271"/>
the importance of his subject. We see him
at every moment—I do not say pouring forth
sharp railleries against Mr. Salmasius; that
would not injure his Work, but gain the
laughers on his side—attempting to be far∣cical,
and to play off the buffoon. This cen∣sure
particularly extends to his two answers of
Mr. Morus. They are replete with outrage∣ous
jests. The character of the Author here
appears without a mask; he is one of those sa∣tiric
geniuses, who, indeed, are too fond of
collecting all the disadvantageous reports of
others, and of having written, by the enemies
of another, all the calumnies they know; but
who feel a greater gratification to insert those
calumnies in the first libel they publish against
any one.'</P>
<P>I hope this heavy charge laid to our great
Poet is not just. He felt great provocations
from Salmasius and Morus; and he was deeply
concerned in one of the greatest political re∣volutions.
Surely, the sublime conceptions of
<PB N="257" REF="272"/>
Milton could not descend to collect the tattle
of Scandal. To do this, one must have a mind
as little, and a heart as rancorous, as some of
our modern versificators.</P>

<HEAD>TRIALS AND PROOFS OF GUILT IN SUPER∣STITIOUS
AGES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a melancholy contemplation, to reflect on
the strange trials to which, in the remoter
ages, those suspected of guilt were put. The
Ordeal consisted of various kinds: walking
blindfold amidst heated plough-shares; passing
through two fires; holding in the hand a red∣hot
bar; and plunging the hand into boiling
water. Challenging the accuser to single com∣bat,
when frequently the stoutest champion
<PB N="260" REF="275"/>
was allowed to supply their place; the swal∣lowing
a morsel of consecrated bread; the
sinking or swimming in a river for witchcraft;
and various others. Though sometimes these
might be eluded by the artifice of the priest,
what numbers of innocent victims have been
sacrificed to such barbarous superstitions!</P>
<P>In the twelfth century, they were very com∣mon.
Hildebert, Bishop of Mans, being ac∣cused
of high-treason by our William Rufus,
was preparing to undergo one of these trials;
when Ives, Bishop of Chartres, convinced him
that they were against the canons of the con∣stitutions
of the church.</P>
<P>An Abbot of Saint Aubin of Angers, who
lived in 1066, having refused to present a horse
to the Viscount of Touars, which the Vis∣count
claimed in right of his lordship, when∣ever
an Abbot first took possession of the
said abbey; the Ecclesiastic offered to justify
himself by the trial of the ordeal, or by duel,
for which he proposed to furnish a man.
<PB N="261" REF="276"/>
The Viscount, at first, agreed to the duel; but,
reflecting that these combats, though sanction∣ed
by the church, depended wholly on the skill
or vigour of the adversary, and could there∣fore
afford no substantial proof of the equity
of his claim, he proposed to compromise
the matter in a manner which strongly cha∣racterizes
the times: he waved his claim, on
condition that the Abbot should not forget to
mention, in his prayers, himself, his wife, and
his brothers! As the <HI>orisons</HI> appeared to the
Abbot, in comparison with the <HI>horse,</HI> of little
or no value, he accepted the proposal.</P>
<P>Pope Eugene approved of, and even intro∣duced,
the trial by immersion in cold water.</P>
<P>It was about that time, also, that those who
were accused of robbery, were put to trial by a
piece of barley bread, on which the mass had
been said; and, if they could not swallow it,
they were declared guilty. This mode of trial
was improved, by adding to the <HI>bread</HI> a slice
of <HI>cheese</HI>; and such were the credulity and
<PB N="262" REF="277"/>
firm dependence on Heaven in these ridiculous
trials, that they were very particular in the
composition of this holy <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>cheese.</HI>
The bread was to be of unleavened barley,
and the cheese made of ewe's milk of the
month of May, no other of the twelve months
having any power to detect a criminal.</P>
<P>Du Cange has observed, that the expression
we long have employed—'<HI>May this piece of
bread choak me!</HI>' comes from this custom.</P>
<P>The anecdote of Earl Godwin's death by
swallowing a piece of bread, in making this
asseveration, is recorded in our history. If it be
true, it was a singular misfortune.</P>
<P>Voltaire says, that they were acquainted in
those times with <HI>secrets</HI> to pass, unhurt, these
singular trials. He particularly mentions one
for undergoing that of boiling water. These
are his words—'The whole secret is said to
consist in rubbing one's self a long time with
the spirit of vitriol and allum, together with
the juice of an onion. None of the Academies
<PB N="263" REF="278"/>
of Science, in our days, have attempted to
verify, by experiments, a truth well known to
quacks and mountebanks.'</P>
<P>But, amongst these trials, not the least ridi∣culous
was that of <HI>the bleeding of a corpse.</HI> If
a person was murdered, it was said that, at the
touch, or at the approach, of the murderer, the
blood gushed out of the body in various parts.
This was once allowed in England; and is
still looked on, in some of the uncivilized parts
of these kingdoms, as a detection of the cri∣minal.
It forms a rich picture to the imagina∣tion
of our old writers; and their narrations
and ballads are laboured into pathos by dwell∣ing
on this phenomenon. Yet, what is this
evidence in the eyes of the enlightened philo∣sopher?
It does not always happen in the pre∣sence
of the murderer; it bleeds suddenly in
that of the innocent: and is it not natural to

warmed by a sudden external heat, having
been considerably stirred or moved, and a

<HEAD>SINGULARITIES OBSERVED BY VARIOUS NA∣TIONS
IN THEIR REPASTS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE collected from a very curious book,
entitled—'<HI>L'Esprit des Usages et des Coutumes,</HI>'
the greater part of the present article.</P>
<P>The Maldivian Islanders eat alone. They
retire into the most hidden parts of their houses;
and they draw down the cloths that serve as
blinds to their windows, that they may eat
unobserved. This custom probably arises—re∣marks
our philosophic Author—from the Sa∣vage,
in the early periods of society, conceal∣ing
himself to eat: he fears that another, with
as sharp an appetite, but more strong than
himself, should come and ravish his meal from
<PB N="265" REF="280"/>
him. Besides, the ideas of Witchcraft are wide∣ly
spread among Barbarians; and they are not
a little fearful that some incantation may be
thrown amongst their victuals.</P>
<P>In noticing the solitary meal of the Maldi∣vian
Islander, another reason may be alledged
for this misanthropical repast. They never will
eat with any one who is inferior to them in
birth, in riches, or dignity; and, as it is a
difficult matter to settle this equality, they are
condemned to lead this unsociable life.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Islanders of the Phi∣lippines
are remarkably sociable. Whenever
one of them finds himself without a compa∣nion
to partake of his meal, he runs till he
meets with one; and, we are assured, that
however keen his appetite may be, he ventures
not to satisfy it without a guest.</P>
<P>Savages, (says Montaigne) when they eat,
'<HI>S'essuyent les doigts oux cuisses, à la bourse des
génitoires, et à la plante des pieds.</HI>' It is impos∣sible
to translate this passage without offending
<PB N="266" REF="281"/>
feminine delicacy; nor can we forbear exulting
in the polished convenience of napkins!</P>
<P>The tables of the rich Chinese shine with a
beautiful varnish, and are covered with silk
carpets very elegantly worked. They do not
make use of plates, knives, or forks: every
guest has two little ivory or ebony sticks, which
he handles very adroitly.</P>
<P>The Otaheiteans, who are lovers of society,
and very gentle in their manners, feed sepa∣rate
from each other. At the hour of repast,
the members of each family divide; two bro∣thers,
two sisters, and even husband and wife,
father and mother, have each their respective
basket. They place themselves at the distance
of two or three yards from each other; they
turn their backs, and take their meal in pro∣found
silence.</P>
<P>The custom of drinking, at different hours
from those assigned for eating, is to be met
with amongst many savage nations. It was
originally begun from necessity. It became an
<PB N="267" REF="282"/>
habit, which subsisted even when the fountain
was near to them. ''A people transplanted,'
observes our ingenious Philosopher, 'preserve,
in another climate, modes of living which re∣late
to those from whence they originally
came. It is thus the Indians of Brazil scru∣pulously
abstain from eating when they drink,
and from drinking when they eat.'</P>
<P>When neither decency or politeness are
known, the man who invites his friends to a
repast, is greatly embarrassed to testify his
esteem for his guests, and to present them with
some amusement; for the savage guest imposes
on him this obligation. Amongst the greater
part of the American Indians the host is con∣tinually
on the watch to solicit them to eat;
but touches nothing himself. In New France,
he wearies himself with singing, to divert the
company while they eat.</P>
<P>When civilization advances, we wish to shew
our confidence to our friends: we treat them as
relations; and it is said that, in China, the
<PB N="268" REF="283"/>
master of the house, to give a mark of his po∣liteness,
absents himself while his guests regale
themselves at his table in undisturbed revelry.</P>
<P>The demonstrations of friendship, in a rude
state, have a savage and gross character, which
it is not a little curious to observe. The Tartars
pull a man by the ear, to press him to drink;
and they continue tormenting him till he opens
his mouth. It is then they clap their hands,
and dance before him.</P>
<P>No customs seem more ridiculous than those
practised by a Kamtschadale, when he wishes
to make another his friend. He first invites
him to eat. The host and his guest strip them∣selves
in a cabin, which is heated to an uncom∣mon
degree. While the guest devours the food
with which they serve him, the other con∣tinually
stirs the fire. The stranger must bear
the excess of the heat as well as of the repast.
He vomits ten times before he will yield; but,
at length, obliged to acknowledge himself
overcome, he begins to compound matters.
<PB N="269" REF="284"/>
He purchases a moment's respite by a present
of cloaths or dogs; for his host threatens to
heat the cabin, and to oblige him to eat till he
dies. The stranger has the right of retaliation
allowed to him: he treats in the same manner,
and exacts the same presents. Should his host
not accept the invitation of his guest, whom he
has so handsomely regaled, he would come
and inhabit his cabin till he had obtained from
him the presents he had in so singular a manner
given to him.</P>
<P>For this extravagant custom a curious reason
has been alledged. It is meant to put the per∣son
to a trial whose friendship is sought. The
Kamtschadale, who is at the expence of the
fires and the repast, is desirous to know if the
stranger has the strength to support pain with
him, and if he is generous enough to share
with him some part of his property. While
the guest is employed on his meal, he continues
heating the cabin to an insupportable degree;
and, for a last proof of the stranger's constancy
<PB N="270" REF="285"/>
and attachment, he exacts more cloaths and
more dogs. The host passes through the same
ceremonies in the cabin of the stranger; and
he shews, in his turn, with what degree of
fortitude he can defend his friend. It is thus
the most singular customs would appear simple,
if it were possible for the Philosopher to con∣template
them on the spot.</P>
<P>As a distinguishing mark of their esteem, the
Negroes of Ardra drink out of one cup at the
same time. The King of Loango eats in one
house, and drinks in another. A Kamtscha∣dale
kneels before his guest; he cuts an enor∣mous
slice from a sea-calf; he crams it entire
into the mouth of his friend, furiously crying
out—'<HI>Tana!</HI>—There!' and, cutting away
what hangs about his lips, snatches and swal∣lows
it with avidity.</P>
<P>A barbarous magnificence attended the feasts
of the ancient Monarchs of France. We are
informed that, after their coronation or conse∣cration,
<PB N="271" REF="286"/>
when they sat at table, the nobility
served them on horseback.</P>

<HEAD>DISPENSATIONS FOR MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>GREGORY the Great was the first of the
Popes who introduced the custom of Dispen∣sations
for Marriage. It was occasioned by
William the Conqueror; who, having espous∣ed
Matilda, daughter of Baldwin the Fifth,
Count of Flanders, who was related to him in
a prohibited degree, the Pope permitted him
to live with her, on condition of him and Ma∣tilda
each founding an abbey. In this busi∣ness
it appears, the Pope got <HI>two abbeys</HI> for

<HEAD>ENGLISH LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to premise, that the present
strictures concerning our Country, our Di∣vines,
<PB N="272" REF="287"/>
and our lovely Country-Women, were
written in the days when our great grandmo∣thers
were Misses.</P>
<P>Menage says—'Mr. D. tells me that, in Eng∣land,
the <HI>public places</HI> are crouded with the
daughters and the wives of the Clergy. The
reason is, that the <HI>livings</HI> there, being very fat
ones, all the English Ladies who are fond of their
ease and good living, and who are more par∣tial
to the present hour than to the future, are
in raptures to marry a Parson; who, on his
side, never fails, according to the character of
a good Ecclesiastic, of selecting the most beau∣tiful.
After his death, mother and daughters
find themselves probably in the greatest di∣stress;
and, as they are in general very <HI>hand∣some,</HI>
they put into practice all their smiles and
all their graces; and, for this reason, chuse
the public resorts of Fashion where they may
attract notice. We Catholics should be grate∣ful
to the Council of Trent, that prohibited our
Ecclesiastics from marriage, and thus obviated

<HEAD>SPANISH MONKS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Monks in Spain have introduced a
custom which is very useful to them. It is,
that the money to pay the masses which a dy∣ing
man orders to be said for him, must be
paid out of the estate he leaves, in preference
to all his debts. The Spaniards, who seem
to have a terrible dread of his Satanic Ma∣jesty,
order frequently so great a number
of masses, that too often there remains little
or nothing for their unfortunate heirs and cre∣ditors.
On these occasions, they say, in their
humorous way—'<HI>Mr. Such-an-one has left
his soul his heir.</HI>' A Spanish monarch or∣dered
100,000 masses to be said for him. If
masses will stand in lieu of so many virtues, the
worst Kings will certainly have the best seats

<P>SAINT Chrysostom has a very acute obser∣vation

Good Kings desire it, as they imagine—con∣tinues
this pious Politician—that their glory

bad desire it, as they consider such Kings will
serve to countenance their own misdemeanors.</P>

<HEAD>THE VIRGIN MARY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Melchior Inchoffer, a Jesuit, pub∣lished
a book to vindicate a miracle of a <HI>Letter</HI>
which the Virgin Mary had addressed to the
citizens of Messina, Naudé brought him se∣rious
proofs of it's evident forgery. Inchoffer
ingenuously confessed, that he knew it was an
<PB N="275" REF="290"/>
imposture, but that he did it by the <HI>orders</HI> of
his <HI>superiors.</HI> The honest and indignant Naudé
observes—'It is thus errors and illusions are
spread about the world; and thus it is, that
simple minds are deceived every day!' There
is no danger, in the present times, of our being
cheated by <HI>Letters</HI> from the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI>
That post-office which yielded such consider∣able
revenues to the Ecclesiastics, has been
closed this century past. What a <HI>revolution</HI> has
there taken place in the human mind! The
most enlightened Writers about 1600 to 1650,
are either seriously combating, or seriously de∣fending,
<HI>Miracles!</HI> Patin very cautiously ven∣tures
to say, that he thinks there are <HI>no Ma∣gicians,</HI>
nor <HI>Sorcerers!</HI> He believes, however,
in <HI>Apparitions</HI> and <HI>Devils!</HI></P>
<P>Since I have got the Virgin Mary in my
mind, I recollect a <HI>Donation</HI> made to her by
Louis the Eleventh: nor can I but approve of
the <HI>manner</HI> he employed to present her with
this pious gift. He made a solemn donation of
<PB N="276" REF="291"/>
<HI>the whole county</HI> of Boulogne to the Holy Vir∣gin—retaining, however, for <HI>his own use, the
Revenues!</HI> This act bears the date of the year
1478; and it is thus entitled: the translation
is literal—'Conveyance of Louis the Ele∣venth,

<HEAD>PROTESTANTS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have frequently heard the oppressed Pro∣testants
bitterly complain of the Catholic ty∣ranny.
What I now transcribe from Patin,
will shew that there is something to be
said on the other side. The stubborn bigot is
alarmed; religious distinctions have been, how∣ever,
since his days, wearing fast away; and,
as Philosophy enlightens the mind, the heart
<PB N="277" REF="292"/>
insensibly will become more moral, though not
so religious.</P>
<P>' All the Huguenots—or Protestants—of
Europe, will <HI>one day agree</HI> together, and oc∣casion
a general revolt, under the name of
Religion; particularly, whenever they shall
have for their chief an enterprizing genius like
that of the King of Sweden—Charles the
Twelfth. I fear <HI>those people</HI>—he says con∣temptuously—if they get the upper hand of
us, will not spare us. They will treat us
savagely, and very differently from what <HI>we do
them</HI>—Witness the massacre of St. Bartholo∣mew,
and the <HI>once</HI> long flourishing state of
the Inquisition.—They will not even suffer us
to hold <HI>our mass,</HI> as we permit them their ser∣vice.
The Huguenots are dangerous politi∣cians;
insolent, and unmerciful, as they have
lately shewn us in England—the decapitation
of Charles the First—and in France, during
the troubles of the Prince de Condé, in 1562.'</P>
<P>When Patin wrote this, it must be recollect∣ed
that, as he turned his eyes on England, he
<PB N="278" REF="293"/>
had before him the austere and persecuting
Puritans, with Cromwell at their head.</P>

<HEAD>COFFEE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is curious to observe the description <HI>Pur∣chas</HI>—of whom an account has been given in
the first part of this Work—gives us of <HI>Cof∣fee,</HI>
when yet it had not been introduced into
Europe. He writes, that 'the Turks have
<HI>Coffa</HI>-houses more common than ale-houses
with us; in or near to which, on benches in
the street, they will sit chatting most of the
day, drinking their <HI>Coffa</HI>—so called of a berry
it is made of—as hot as they can endure it. It
is black as soot, and tastes not much unlike it:
good, they say, for digestion and mirth.'
The second Edition of this book was published
in 1625. Coffee was introduced into England
by Mr. Edwards, a Turkish merchant, in the
year 1652.</P>

<HEAD>INQUISITION.</HEAD>
<P>INNOCENT the Third, a Pope as enterpriz∣ing
as he was successful in his enterprizes,
having sent Dominic, with some missionaries,
into Languedoc, these men so irritated the
Heretics they were sent to convert, that most
of them were assassinated at Toulouse, in the
year 1200. It was then he called in for aid
temporal arms, and published against them
a crusade; granting, as is usual with the Popes
on similar occasions, all kinds of indulgences
and pardons to those who should arm against
these <HI>Mahometans,</HI> as he stiled these unfor∣tunate
men. Raimond, Count of Toulouse,
was constrained to submit. The inhabitants
were passed on the edge of the sword, without
distinction of age or sex. It was then he esta∣blished
that scourge of Europe, THE INQUI∣SITION:
for having considered that, though
<PB N="280" REF="295"/>
all might be compelled to submit by arms, there
might remain numbers who would profess par∣ticular
dogmas, he established this sanguinary
tribunal solely to inspect into all families, and
examine all persons who they imagined were
unfriendly to the interests of Rome. Dominic
did so much by his cares and continued perse∣cutions,
that he firmly established it at Tou∣louse.</P>
<P>It was as late as the year 1484 that it became
known in Spain. It was also to a Dominican,
John de Torquemada, that the Court of Rome
owed this obligation. As he was the Confessor
of Queen Isabella, he had extorted from her a
promise that, if ever she ascended the throne,
she would use every means to extirpate Heresy
and Heretics. Ferdinand had conquered Gre∣nada,
and had chaced from the Spanish realms
multitudes of unfortunate Moors. A few had
remained; who, with the Jews, he obliged to
become Christians: they at least assumed the
name; but it was well known that both these
<PB N="281" REF="296"/>
nations naturally respected their <HI>own prejudices,</HI>
rather than those of the Christians.</P>
<P>Torquemada pretended that this dissimula∣tion
would greatly hurt the interests of the
Holy Religion. The Queen listened with re∣spectful
diffidence to her Confessor; and, at
length, gained over the King to consent to the
establishment of this barbarous tribunal. Tor∣quemada,
indefatigable in his zeal for the Holy
Seat, in the space of fourteen years that he
exercised the office of Chief Inquisitor, perse∣cuted
one hundred thousand persons, of whom
six thousand were condemned to the flames!</P>
<P>Let us contemplate a slight sketch of that
DESPOTISM which, with the destruction of the
Bastile, we hope is extinguished throughout
Europe.</P>
<P>During the pontificate of Sixtus the Fifth,
the Inquisition was powerful and rigorous in
Rome. Muretus, in writing to De Thou the
Historian, says—'We do not know what be∣comes
of the people here. Almost every day,
<PB N="282" REF="297"/>
when I rise, I hear, with an alarming surprize,
how such an one has disappeared. We dare not
whisper our suspicions: the Inquisition would
be immediately at our doors.'</P>

<HEAD>THE ILLUSTRIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE title of <HI>Illustrious</HI> was never given, till
the reign of Constantine, but to those whose
reputation was splendid in arms or in letters.
Flattery had not yet adopted this noble word
into her Vocabulary. Suetonius has composed
a book, to mention those who had possessed this
title; and, as it was <HI>then</HI> bestowed, a moderate
book was sufficient to contain their names.</P>
<P>In the time of Constantine, the title of <HI>Il∣lustrious</HI>
was given more particularly to those
Princes who had distinguished themselves in
war; but it was not continued to their descen∣dants.
At length, it became very common;
and every son of a Prince was <HI>Illustrious.</HI> It
<PB N="283" REF="298"/>

<HEAD>CROMWELL.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Funeral Oration of Henrietta, Queen

though delicate—</P>
<P>' A man was seen with a profundity of mind
that exceeds our belief. As finished a Hypo∣crite
as he was a skilful Politician; capable of

foresight and prudence; but, for what remain∣ed,
always so vigilant and so ready, that he
never failed to improve the occasions she pre∣sented

daring and adventurous minds which seem
born to change the affairs of the world.'</P>
<P>The Ambassador from the French Court in
that day was an able Minister; and that he
was, at the same time, a fine Writer, the fol∣lowing
sketch of Cromwell evinces. It has
the advantage of being given by one who was
a witness to what he observes—</P>
<P>' He was gentle and cruel when either was
necessary for his interests. He had no faith
in religion, no honour in his professions, no
fidelity to his friends, than as the semblance
of these virtues served towards his aggrandize∣ment.
He knew better than any man to put
into practice all the pious grimaces and in∣sinuating
manners of the false votarists of re∣ligion;
and to conceal, under an humble air
and popular address, an unmeasurable ambi∣tion.
In a word, he possessed, in the supreme
degree, all the qualities of a great Politician;
and there was nothing wanting to compleat

by better means, to have lived longer, and

<HEAD>FASHIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of many, probably of most Fa∣shions,
was in the endeavour to conceal some
deformity of the inventor. Thus Charles the
Seventh, of France, introduced Long Coats, to
hide his ill-made legs. Shoes, with very long
points, full two feet in length, were invented
by Henry Plantaganet, Duke of Anjou, to
conceal a very large excrescence which he had
upon one of his feet.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="306"/>
Sometimes, Fashions are quite reversed in
one age from those of another. Thus Bags,
when first in fashion in France, were only wore
<HI>en dishabille.</HI> In visits of ceremony, the hair
was tied in a ribband, and floated over the
shoulders—all which is exactly contrary to our
present fashion. Queen Isabella, of Bavaria,
as remarkable for her gallantry as the fairness
of her complexion, introduced a fashion of
leaving the shoulders and part of the neck un∣covered.</P>
<P>In England, about the reign of Henry the
Fourth, they wore long-pointed Shoes, to such
an immoderate length, that they could not
walk till they were fastened to their knees
with chains. Luxury improving on this ridi∣culous
mode, it was the custom of an English
Beau of the fourteenth century to have these
chains of gold or silver. A very accurate ac∣count

what may serve as a hint for the heightening

<HEAD>THE GREAT AND LITTLE TURK.</HEAD>
<P>TITLES frequently remain when the occa∣sions
of making them are forgotten. Perhaps,
few know why the Ottoman Emperor is called
<PB N="293" REF="308"/>
<HI>The Great Turk:</HI> it is not, as some have ima∣gined,
to distinguish him from his own sub∣jects.
This was the occasion. Mahomet the
Second was the first of these Emperors on
whom the Christians bestowed the title of the
Great Turk. It was not owing to his great ac∣tions
that this splendid title was accorded to
him, but to the vast extent of his dominions,
in comparison with those of the Sultan of
Iconia, or Cappadocia, his contemporary, who
was distinguished by the title of <HI>The Little
Turk.</HI> After the taking of Constantinople,
Mahomet the Second deprived the latter of his
domains; and still preserved the title of the
Great Turk, though the propriety of it, by
this accident, was lost.</P>

<HEAD>THE POULIATS, AND THE POULICHES.</HEAD>
<P>THE present article, which I have drawn
from Abbé Raynal, presents two pictures of
<PB N="294" REF="309"/>
the debasement of the human race, which, per∣haps,
History has never paralleled.</P>
<P>' There is a tribe amongst the Indians which
is the refuse of the rest. The members of it
are employed in the meanest offices of society.
They bury the dead, carry away dirt, and live
upon the flesh of animals that <HI>die natural
deaths.</HI> They are prohibited from entering in∣to
the <HI>temples</HI> and public <HI>markets</HI>; neither are
they allowed the use of <HI>the wells,</HI> that are com∣mon
to all their inhabitants. Their dwellings
are at the <HI>extremity</HI> of the towns, or consist of
<HI>solitary</HI> cottages in the country; and they are
even <HI>forbidden to appear in the streets</HI> where
the Bramins reside. As all other Indians, they
may employ themselves in the labours of agri∣culture:
but only for the benefit of <HI>the other
tribes</HI>; for they are not permitted to have lands
of their own, not even upon lease. Such is
the degree of horror they excite, that if, by
chance, they were <HI>to touch any one</HI> not belong∣ing
to their tribe, they would be deprived, with
<PB N="295" REF="310"/>
impunity, of <HI>a life</HI> reckoned too abject to de∣serve
the protection of the laws. Most of them
are employed in the culture of rice. Near the
fields where they carry on this work, there is
a kind of hut, into which they retire when they
hear <HI>a cry,</HI> which always comes from a di∣stance,
to give them notice of some order from
the person on whom they depend; to which
they answer, not coming out of their retreat.
They take the same precautions whenever
they are warned, by a confused kind of noise,
of the approach of <HI>any man</HI> whatever. If they
have not time to hide themselves, they fall
<HI>prostrate</HI> on the ground, with their faces down∣wards,
with all the marks of humiliation
which the sense of their disgrace can suggest.</P>
<P>' Whenever the harvests do not answer to the
avidity of an oppressive master, he sometimes
cruelly <HI>sets fire</HI> to the huts of these unhappy
labourers; and if they <HI>attempt</HI> to escape the
flames, <HI>he fires upon them</HI> without mercy! The
condition of these wretched people is horrible
<PB N="296" REF="311"/>
in every respect, even in <HI>the manner</HI> in which
they are forced to provide for their most <HI>urgent
wants.</HI> In the dusk of the evening, they come
out from their retreats in bands; they direct
their steps towards the market, at a certain di∣stance
from which they begin <HI>to bellow!</HI> The
merchants approach; and they ask for what
they want. They are supplied, and the provi∣sions
are laid on the very spot where the mo∣ney
destined for the payment of them has been
previously deposited. When <HI>the purchasers</HI>
can be assured that they shall not be seen by
any one, they come out from behind the hedge
where they had <HI>concealed</HI> themselves, and carry
away, with <HI>precipitation,</HI> what they have ac∣quired
in so singular a manner.'</P>
<P>After contemplating this dishonourable pic∣ture
of Man, (a degeneracy in Human Nature
which probably the reader could hardly suspect)
he may deepen the philosophic reverie by what
the Abbé gives us in continuation.</P>
<P>' Yet this very tribe of <HI>Pouliats</HI> have <HI>an in∣ferior</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="312"/>
one among themselves, called <HI>Pouliches.</HI>
These last are forbidden the use of fire; they
are not permitted to build huts, but are re∣duced
to the necessity of living in a kind of <HI>nest
upon the trees,</HI> or in the forests. When pres∣sed
with hunger, they <HI>howl</HI> like wild beasts, to
excite compassion. The most charitable then
deposit some rice, or other food, at the foot of
a tree, and <HI>retire</HI> with all possible haste to give
the famished wretch an opportunity of taking
it without meeting with his benefactor, who
would think himself polluted by coming near
him.'</P>
<P>To clear up this curious information, which
stretches to the utmost the belief of the reader,
the Abbé presents us with an excellent philo∣sophical
argument. 'This extreme disgrace,' he
says, 'into which a considerable part of a nu∣merous
nation is plunged, has always appear∣ed
an inexplicable circumstance. Men of the
utmost sagacity have never been able to con∣ceive,
how a people, humane and sensible,
<PB N="298" REF="313"/>
could have brought themselves to reduce their
own brethren to so abject a state. To solve
this difficulty, let us be permitted to hazard a
conjecture. In our half barbarous govern∣ments,
dreadful torments, or an ignominious
death, are allotted to those criminals who have
disturbed, in a greater or less degree, the peace
of society. May we not therefore reasonably
suppose that, in the soft climate of India, a
more moderate system of legislature may have
been satisfied with <HI>excluding</HI> from their tribes
all kinds of malefactors? This punishment
must appear to them sufficient to put a stop to
the commissions of such crimes; and it was
certainly the best adapted to a country where
the effusion of blood was always forbidden
by religious as well as moral principles. It
would certainly have been a very proper cir∣cumstance,
if <HI>the children</HI> had not inherited the
infamy of their parents: but there were un∣furmountable
prejudices which militated against
this reinstatement; a family never being re∣ceived
<PB N="299" REF="314"/>
again into a tribe after it had been once
expelled from it.'</P>
<P>The solution of the Abbé is ingenious and
probable: but the Mosaic threat of vengeance
extending to the third and fourth generation, is
uncongenial to the mild spirit of humane philo∣sophy.
Yet is this threat on record in those Com∣mandments
which are said to have been written
by the finger of God himself. Surely this can∣not
accord with the unwearied benevolence of
a paternal Deity! Let us rather acknowledge,
with a sigh, that there are multitudes of the
human race who really believe themselves to
be the property of a small number of men who
oppress them. The image of the Creator is so
debased in some parts of the globe, that it may
be said, the hand of the oppressor has effaced
every mark of it's original greatness.</P>

to that sublime character they hold in the scale
of creation, and to write with their own blood
the <HI>charter</HI> of their liberty? We have just come
from meditating on nations who, beneath the
enervating skies of India, destitute of the de∣lights

turn our eyes to the bleak heaven, and the
snowy mountains, of Switzerland, where the
hardy native roams free and unconstrained, and
'knows himself a MAN.'</P>
<P>The pride, the insolence, and the tyranny,
of those governors who were given to the Hel∣vetians,
in the name of the Empire, by the

of this people, who regarded freedom as their

<HEAD>CHARLES THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>A FRENCH writer has recorded an anecdote
of this unfortunate Prince, which characterizes
the classical turn of his mind, and the placa∣bility
of his disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="317"/>
' A Frenchman, who had formed a tender
connection with the wife of one of the princi∣pal
enemies of Charles—who was then put
under arrest, but very carelessly guarded—having learnt from this lady, that they had re∣solved
to make the King perish on a scaffold,
communicated the intelligence to Mr. De Belli∣core,
the French Ambassador, who immedi∣ately
ran to the King, to give him the impor∣tant
notice. Bellicore was kept in waiting for
a long time: at last, the King came to him,
and said—I have been at a comedy; and I
never was more entertained.—Ah, Sire!
answered Bellicore, it is about a <HI>tragedy</HI> of
which I have to speak to you! And then in∣formed
him of what had been lately commu∣nicated
to him; entreating him, at the same
time, to save himself by a vessel which he
could instantly prepare. The King calmly
answered him with this fine line from Ovid—<HI>Qui procumbit humi, non habet unde cadat—</HI>
He who lies prostrate on the earth, need not
<PB N="303" REF="318"/>
fear to fall.'—'Sire,' said Bellicore, 'they may
occasion <HI>his head</HI> to fall!'</P>
<P>This shews, that he did not suspect their
cruelties would ever have been carried to the
length they were; and it must be confessed,
when he had been brought so <HI>low,</HI> all the rest
was persecuting inhumanity.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>'KING OF ENGLAND, FRANCE, &amp;c.'</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more empty and ridiculous
than the title which our Monarchs assume of
'<HI>The King of France.</HI>' It would characterize
a great Prince to eraze from his true honours
this fictitious one. An <HI>English</HI> Monarch should
not suffer his dignity to be exposed to the smile
of the Philosopher.</P>
<P>Charpentier very temperately states the only
two principles by which our Kings can assume
this title. The first, from Edward the Third
being son of Isabella of France, who was sister
<PB N="304" REF="319"/>
to three Kings of France—Louis Hutin, Philip
the Long, and Charles the Fair, who died
without children. So that Edward, their ne∣phew,
disputed the crown of France with
<HI>Philip de Valois,</HI> on the foundation of the
Salique Law, which had never yet been agi∣tated.
This law says, that the kingdom of
France <HI>ne tombant point en quenouille</HI>: <HI>i. e.</HI>
'the sceptre of France shall never degenerate
into a distaff.' The children of the daughters
of France can never succeed to it. As the pre∣sent
Monarchs of England are not descendants
of this <HI>Edward,</HI> they cannot have any preten∣sions
to the crown of France, if it had not
been a maxim with them, that the rights once
devolved on the crown are for ever unalienable
and imprescriptible. The second principle is,
the donation which Charles the Sixth made of
the Crown of France to our Henry the Fifth,
his son-in-law, to the exclusion of his son
Charles the Seventh.</P>
<P>We may add, here, that Cromwell offered
<PB N="305" REF="320"/>
to sell Cardinal Mazarine all the vouchers for
France which are preserved in the Tower, for
a hundred thousand crowns. It was at this
price he rated the claims of England to the
Crown of France; but the Cardinal wisely
deemed even that sum too high a price.</P>
<P>If it be a maxim with our crown, of which
I am ignorant, that the rights once devolved
upon it, are unalienable and imprescriptible, it
may be said that we possess the United States
of America; but, I believe, this sovereignty
would not be so easily permitted as that of the
French monarchy.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</HEAD>
<P>THAT it is dangerous to exercise our raillery

<P>Philip the First, of France, frequently in∣dulged
his humour at the expence of the Con∣queror's
<PB N="306" REF="321"/>
rather too large <HI>embonpoint</HI> and pro∣minent
belly. When William remained un∣commonly
long at Rouen, Philip, who did not
much approve of his proximity to his court,
frequently, in a jesting manner, enquired of
his courtiers if they did not know when Wil∣liam
would lie-in? The Conqueror, informed
of this <HI>jest,</HI> gave him to understand that, when
he should get abroad, he would come to re∣turn
his compliments, for his kind enquiries,
to Saint Genevieve, at Paris, with ten thou∣sand
lances, instead of candles! Whatever
might be the wit of these Monarchs, the arms
of William were not contemptible. Such was
the vengeance he took for the raillery of Philip,
that he desolated, in a short time, the French
Vexin, burnt the city of Mantes, and massacred
the inhabitants; and, had not his death im∣peded
his progress, he very probably would
have conquered France, as he had England.</P>

which had long been the idol of his ambition,
to sink into a solitary retreat, with a pension

<P><PB N="309" REF="324"/>
Attila died in 453; and was buried, in the
midst of a vast champaign, in a coffin which
was inclosed in one of gold, another of silver,
and the third of iron. With the body were
interred all the spoils of the enemy—harnesses,
embroidered with gold, and studded with
jewels; rich silks; and whatever they had
taken most precious in the palaces of the
Kings they had pillaged: and, that the place
of his interment might for ever remain con∣cealed,
the Huns deprived of life all who had
assisted at his burial.</P>
<P>The Goths had done nearly the same for Ala∣ric,
in 410, at Cosence, a town in Calabria. They
turned aside the River Vasento; and, having
formed a grave in the midst of it's bed where
it's course was most rapid, they interred this
King with prodigious accumulations of riches.

voice of Patriotism heard in a corrupted court
would have become a crime never to have been

manner of conveying to him his censure. He
caused to be laid on his table, one day, a letter,
sealed, which bore this address—'To the King

service of the Duke of Lerma.'</P>
<P>In a similar manner, Don Carlos, son to

Modern History has recorded many such in∣stances.</P>
<P>In Candide, or the Optimist, the reader will

Europe, who had been deprived of their
crowns.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="327"/>
What adds to this exquisite satire, is, that
the Eight Monarchs are not of the fictitious
Majesties of the Poetic Brain; Imperial Sha∣dows,
like those that appeared to Macbeth;
but living Monarchs, who were wandering at

<P>Theodore, King of Corsica, is not yet for∣gotten

Count Fathom, has given us some curious
anecdotes, which paint very forcibly the singu∣lar
distresses of that Monarch.</P>
<P>Here is another to be added to this list. In
the year 1595, died at Paris, Antonio, King of
Portugal. His body is interred at the Cor∣deliers,
and his heart deposited at the Ave
Maria. Nothing on earth was capable of
obliging this Prince to renounce his crown.
He passed over to England, and came to
France, where he resided; and died, in great
poverty, at the age of sixty-four years. This
dethroned Monarch was happy in one thing,
which is indeed rare. In all his miseries,
<PB N="313" REF="328"/>
he had a servant, who proved a tender and
faithful friend, and who only desired to parti∣cipate
in his misfortunes, and to soften his
miseries; and, for the recompence of his ser∣vices,
he only wished to be buried at the feet of
his dear master. This hero in loyalty, to whom
the ancient Romans had raised altars, was Don
Diego Bothei, one of the greatest Lords of the
Court of Portugal, and who drew his origin
from the Kings of Bohemia.</P>

an aversion for ugly and ill-made men,
who had been treated unfortunately by Nature,
that she could not endure their presence.</P>

hunch-backed, &amp;c. in a word, all those whose
appearance might shock her delicate sensa∣tions.</P>
<P>' There is this singular and admirable in the
conduct of Elizabeth, that she made her plea∣sures
subservient to her politics, and she main∣tained
her affairs by what in general occasions

the ruin of Princes. So secret were her amours,
that, even to the present day, their mysteries
cannot be penetrated; but the utility she drew
from them is public, and always operated for
the good of her people. Her lovers were her

her royal footsteps, Raleigh immediately spread
his new plush cloak across the miry place. The
Queen stepped cautiously on it, and passed over
dry; but not without a particular observation of

<P>OF these men, who are singular instances of
a patriarchal longevity of life, the reader will
not be displeased to attend to the following
well authenticated notices concerning them.</P>
<P>Thomas Parr was born in the last year of
King Edward the Fourth, anno 1483. He
married his first wife, Jane, at eighty years of
age; and, in above thirty years, she brought
him but two children, the eldest of which did
not live above three years. He married his
second wife, Catherine, when he was an hun∣dred
and twenty years of age, by whom he
had one child. He lived till he had attained
to something above one hundred and fifty years
of age. Thomas, Earl of Arundel, caused
him to be brought to Westminster about two
months before his death: there he passed
<PB N="319" REF="336"/>
most of his time in sleep; and an ocular wit∣ness
has thus described him—<Q><L>From head to heel, his body had, all over,</L>
<L>A quickset, thickset, nat'ral, hairy cover.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is supposed this removal, by taking him
from his native air, and the disturbance of
much company, hastened his death. He died
there, November 15, 1634, in the ninth year
of King Charles the First, and was buried in
the Abbey.</P>
<P>Henry Jenkins lived till he was an hundred
and sixty-nine years of age. A remarkable
circumstance discovered the age of this man.
Being sworn a witness in a cause of an hundred
and twenty years, the judge could not help
reproving him, till he said he was <HI>then</HI> butler
to the Lord Conyers; and, at length, his name
was found in some old register of the Lord
Conyers's menial servants. Dr. Tancred Ro∣binson,
who sent the account of this man to
the Royal Society, adds farther, that Henry
<PB N="320" REF="337"/>
Jenkins, coming into his sister's kitchen to beg
an alms, he asked him, how old he was? Af∣ter
a little pausing, he said, he was about one
hundred and sixty-two or three. The Doctor
asked him, what Kings he remembered? He
said, 'Henry the Eighth.' What public things
he could longest remember? He said, 'The
fight at Flowden Field.' Whether the King
was there? He said, 'No, he was in France,
and the Earl of Surrey was General.' How
old he was then? He said, 'About twelve
years old.' The Doctor inspected an old Chro∣nicle
that was in the house, and found that the
Battle of Flowden Field was one hundred and
fifty-two years before; that the Earl he named
was General; and that Henry the Eighth was
then at Tournay.</P>

<HEAD>FEUDAL TYRANNY.</HEAD>
<P>THE Feudal government introduced a species
of servitude which till that time was unknown,
and which was called the Servitude of the
Land. The Bondmen, or Villains, did not
reside in the house of the Lord: but they en∣tirely
depended on his caprice; and he sold
them, as he did the animals, with the field
where they lived, and which they cultivated.</P>
<P>It is difficult to conceive with what insolence
the petty Lords of those times tyrannized over
their Villains: they not only oppressed their
slaves with unremitted labour, instigated by a
vile cupidity; but their whim and caprice led
them to inflict miseries without even any mo∣tive
of interest.</P>
<P>In Scotland, they had a right to enjoy the
first-fruits of all the Maidens; and Malcolm
the Third did not abolish this shameful right
<PB N="322" REF="339"/>
but by ordering that they might be redeemed
by a quit-rent.</P>
<P>Others, to preserve this privilege when they
could not enjoy it in all it's extent, thrust their
leg, booted, into the bed of the new-married
couple. Others have compelled their subjects
to pass the first night at the top of a tree, and
there to consummate the marriage; to pass the
bridal hours in a river; to be bound naked to
a cart, and to trace some furrows as they were
dragged; or to leap, with their feet tied, over
the horns of stags.</P>
<P>Sometimes their caprice commanded the
bridegroom to appear in drawers at their castle,
and plunge into a ditch of mud; and some∣times
they were compelled to beat the waters
of the ponds, to hinder the frogs from dis∣turbing
the Lord!</P>
<P>There was a time when the German Lords
reckoned, amongst their privileges, that of
robbing on the highways of their territory!</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind the reader of the
<PB N="323" REF="340"/>
shameful behaviour of Geoffrey, Lord of Co∣ventry,
who compelled his wife to ride naked,
on a white pad, through the streets of the town;
that, by this mode, he might restore to the in∣habitants
those privileges of which his wan∣tonness
had deprived them.</P>
<P>When the Abbot of Figeac makes his entry
into that town, the Lord of Montbrun, dressed
in a Harlequin's coat, and one of his legs
naked, is compelled, by an ancient custom, to
conduct him to the door of his abbey, by lead∣ing
his horse by the bridle.</P>
<P>The Feudal Barons frequently associated to
share amongst them those children of their Vil∣lains
who appeared to be the most healthy and
serviceable, or who were remarkable for their
talents; and, not infrequently, sold them in
their markets as they did their beasts.</P>
<P>The Feudal servitude is not, even in the pre∣sent
enlightened times, entirely abolished in Po∣land,
in Germany, and in Russia. In those coun∣tries,
the Bondmen are still entirely dependent
<PB N="324" REF="341"/>
on the caprice of their masters. The Peasants
of Hungary, or Bohemia, frequently revolt,
and attempt to shake off the pressure of Feudal
tyranny; and it is ardently to be wished that
their wretched servitude should in some mea∣sure
be softened.</P>
<P>It is scarce thirty years past, when a Lord or
Prince of the Northern Countries, passing
through one of his villages, observed a little
assembly of Peasants and their families amusing
themselves with dancing. He commands his
domestics to part the men from the women,
and confine them in the houses. He or∣ders
that the coats of the women may be
drawn up above their heads, and tied with their
garters. He then permits the men to be libe∣rated,
and inflicts a severe castigation on all
those who did not recognize their wives in that
state!</P>
<P>Absolute dominion hardens the human heart;
and Nobles, accustomed to command their
Bondmen, will treat their domestics as slaves.
<PB N="325" REF="342"/>
Those of Siberia punish theirs by an abundant
use of the cudgel or rod. The Abbé Chappe
saw two Russian slaves undress a chambermaid,
who had, by some trifling negligence, given
offence to her mistress: after having uncovered
as far as her waist, one placed her head betwixt
his knees; the other held her by the feet;
while both, armed with two sharp rods, vio∣lently
lashed her back, till it pleased the tyrant
of the house to decree <HI>it was enough!</HI></P>
<P>After a perusal of these anecdotes of Feudal
Tyranny, I shall take leave to transcribe the
following lines from Goldsmith—<Q><L>Calm is my soul, nor apt to rise in arms,</L>
<L>Except when fast-approaching danger warms:</L>
<L>But, when contending Chiefs blockade the Throne,</L>
<L>Contracting Regal power, to stretch their own;</L>
<L>When I behold a factious Band agree</L>
<L>To call it Freedom, when themselves are free;</L>
<L>Fear, Pity, Justice, Indignation, start,</L>
<L>Tear off reserve, and bare my swelling heart;</L>
<L>Till half a Patriot, half a Coward, grown,</L>
<L>I fly from PETTY TYRANTS—to the THRONE.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>GAMING.</HEAD>
<P>GAMING appears to be an universal passion.
Some have attempted to deny it's universality;
they have imagined that it is chiefly prevalent
in cold climates, where such a passion becomes
most capable of agitating and gratifying the
torpid minds of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>But, if we lay aside speculation, and turn
to facts, we are surely warranted in the sup∣position
that, as the love of Gaming proceeds
from a varice—that dishonourable passion which,
probably, for some wise purposes, is so con∣genial
to the human heart—it is not unjust to
conclude, that it exists with equal force in
human nature; and, consequently, the fatal
propensity of Gaming is to be discovered, as
well amongst the inhabitants of the frigid and
torrid zones, as amongst those of the milder cli∣mates.
The savage and the civilized, the illi∣terate
and the learned, are alike captivated with
<PB N="327" REF="344"/>
the hope of accumulating wealth without the
labours of industry.</P>
<P>Mr. Moore has lately given to the Public
an elaborate Work, which professedly treats of
the three most important topics which a wri∣ter
of the present day can discuss—Suicide,
Gaming, and Duelling. He has collected a va∣riety
of instances of this destructive passion
being prevalent in all nations; and I shall just
notice those which appear most singular.</P>
<P><HI>Dice,</HI> and that little pugnacious animal the
<HI>Cock,</HI> are the chief instruments employed by
the numerous nations of the East, to agitate
their minds and ruin their fortunes; to which
the Chinese—who are desperate gamesters—add
the use of <HI>Cards.</HI> When all other property
is played away, the Asiatic gambler scruples
not to stake his <HI>wife,</HI> or his <HI>child,</HI> on the cast of
a die, or courage and strength of a martial
bird. If still unsuccessful, the last venture he
stakes is, <HI>himself!</HI></P>
<P>In the Island of Ceylon, <HI>cock-fighting</HI> is car∣ried
<PB N="328" REF="345"/>
to a great height. The Sumatrans are ad∣dicted
to the use of dice. A strong spirit of
play characterizes a Malayan. After having
resigned every thing to the good fortune of the
winner, he is reduced to a horrid state of des∣peration;
he then loosens a certain lock of
hair, which indicates war and destruction to all
the raving gamester meets. He intoxicates
himself with opium; and, working himself up
into a fit of phrenzy, he bites and kills every
one who comes in his way. But, as soon as
ever this lock is seen flowing, it is <HI>lawful</HI> to
fire at the person, and to destroy him as fast as
possible. I think it is this which our sailors
call, 'To run a muck.' Thus Dryden writes—<Q><L>Frontless, and satire-proof, he scours the streets,</L>
<L>And <HI>runs</HI> an Indian <HI>Muck</HI> at all he meets.</L></Q> Thus also Pope—<Q><L>Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet</L>
<L>To <HI>run a Muck,</HI> and tilt at all I meet.</L></Q></P>
<P>Johnson could not discover the derivation of
<PB N="329" REF="346"/>
the word <HI>Muck.</HI> I think I have heard that
it refers to their employing, on these fatal oc∣casions,
a <HI>muck,</HI> or lance; but my recollection
is, probably, imperfect.</P>
<P>To discharge their gambling debts, the
Siamese sell their possessions, their families,
and, at length, themselves. The Chinese play
<HI>night</HI> and <HI>day,</HI> till they have lost all they are
worth; and then they usually go and hang
themselves. Such is the propensity of the
Japanese for high play, that they were com∣pelled
to make a law, that 'Whoever ventures
his money at play, shall be put to death.' In
the newly-discovered islands of the Pacific
Ocean, they venture even their hatchets, which
they hold as invaluable acquisitions, on running
matches. 'We saw a man,' as Cooke writes
in his last voyage, 'beating his breast, and
tearing his hair, in the violence of rage, for
having lost three hatchets at one of these races,
and which he had purchased with nearly half
his property.'</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="347"/>
The ancient nations were not less addicted
to gaming. In the same volume are collected
numerous instances amongst the ancient Per∣sians,
Grecians, and Romans; the Goths, the
Germans, &amp;c. To notice the modern ones
were a melancholy task: there is hardly a
family in Europe who cannot record, from their
own domestic annals, the dreadful prevalence
of this unfortunate passion. Affection has felt
the keenest lacerations, and Genius been irre∣coverably
lost, by a wanton sport, which doom∣ed
to destruction the hopes of families, and
consumed the heart of the Gamester with cor∣rosive
agony.</P>

<HEAD>THE ATHENIANS.</HEAD>
<P>MARVILLE has given this pleasing ac∣count
of the Athenians—</P>
<P>' The Greeks were so polished a nation, that
they treated others as rude and barbarous;
but, of all the Greeks, the Athenians possessed
<PB N="331" REF="348"/>
a more refined delicacy in the politer Arts, and
an exquisite taste for Eloquence. The excel∣lent
Orators who arose amongst them had fa∣miliarized
them with the most perfect beauties
of composition.</P>
<P>' Pericles, whose eloquence they compared to
lightnings and thunders, had so accustomed
their minds to suffer nothing but what was
pure, elegant, and finished, that those who had
to speak in public, looked upon the lowest of
the people as so many censurers of what they
were going to say. But, if the genius of this
people had become so delicate by the attic elo∣quence
of their Orators, the native haughtiness
of the Greeks was much increased by their
servile adulation; so that it required a wonder∣ful
dexterity to stretch the empire of Per∣suasion
over men who always would be treated
like masters.</P>
<P>' The establishment of the singular law of
<HI>Ostracism,</HI> which was occasioned by the tyranny
of Pisistratus, caused a double increase of pride
<PB N="332" REF="349"/>
to this people, who were already so presumptu∣ous.
Thus runs the sentence of this famous
law—"Let no one of us excel the others; and,
if there should be one found of this description,
let him go and excel elsewhere." By this law,
those whose great merit and high reputation
gave umbrage to their citizens, were banished
for ten years.</P>
<P>' It was, in it's commencement, observed
with so much rigour, that Aristides, who was
surnamed <HI>The Just,</HI> and who had performed so
many great actions for the glory of his country,
was condemned to banishment: and, although
this severity had greatly abated of it's rigour
under Alcibiades, and that it was abolished in
the course of time; there remained, in the
manners and minds of the Athenians, a
great jealousy of those who had distinguished
themselves by some extraordinary merit; and
a rigorous severity towards their Orators, which
constrained them to be very circumspect. The
rules they had imposed on them went so far
<PB N="333" REF="350"/>
as to prohibit their displaying ornaments too
elaborate, which might disguise their real
sentiments—images and motions, capable of
affecting and softening their auditors—for they
regarded the first as false lights, that might
mislead their reason; and the latter, as at∣tempts
to encroach on their liberty, by swaying
their passions. It is to this we must attribute
that coldness and austerity which pervade the
discourses of these Orators, and which rather
proceeded from the restraint laid on them than
from the qualities of their genius.</P>
<P>' Besides that the Athenians were haughty,
jealous of their power, and austere towards
their Orators, they had an impatience, and a
volatility of disposition, which occasioned
them frequently to pass from one extreme to
another, by sudden and unexpected resolutions,
and often broke all the measures and schemes
of those who attempted to gain them over to
their sentiments.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="351"/>
' A hand raised, or a loud cry from some
factious person, in an assembly, was often the
signal for an advice that was to be disclosed, or
of a counsel which was to be taken: and as it
happens, that those who are the most insolent
when they command, are the most supple when
they obey; the Athenians, who had been so
haughty during the prosperity of their Re∣public,
were the most abject slaves to the suc∣cessors
of Alexander; and afterwards to the
Romans, when they became their masters.
This feeble people had, in the bottom of their
hearts, a fund of meanness and of timidity,
which made them constrain their Orators to
conform themselves to their manners and their
genius. To succeed with them, it became
necessary to appear to respect them, whilst
they taught them to fear; to flatter and to
censure them, at the same time—a policy
which Demosthenes, who well knew this
people, with great success so skilfully ap∣plied.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="352"/>
' This people has, however, produced great
men, and in great numbers; but they had so
seldom a share in the public resolutions, that
their merit, of which they have left so many
illustrious testimonies, cannot, however, make
a general rule to judge of the character of this
people.'</P>
<P>To this ingenious discrimination of the cha∣racter
of the Athenians, I cannot forbear trans∣cribing
an animated description of their luxu∣ries,
carried to such an excess of refinement,
and opulent elegance, that those who are fond
of censuring our modern dissipations, may be
reminded, that we have never yet approached
those of the Grecians or the Romans. It is
extracted from Dr. Gillies's History of Greece.</P>
<P>' Instead of the bread, herbs, and simple
fare, recommended by the Laws of Solon,
the Athenians, soon after the 80th Olympiad,
availed themselves of their extensive com∣merce,
to import the delicacies of distant coun∣tries,
which were prepared by all the refine∣ments
<PB N="336" REF="353"/>
of cookery. The wines of Cyprus were
cooled with snow in summer; in winter, the
most delightful flowers adorned the tables and
persons of the wealthy Athenians. Nor was it
sufficient to be crowned with roses, unless
they were likewise anointed with the most pre∣cious
perfumes. Parasites, dancers, and buf∣foons,
were an usual appendage of every en∣tertainment.
Among the weaker sex, the pas∣sion
for delicate birds, distinguished by their
voice or plumage, was carried to such excess,
as merited the name of madness. The bodies
of such youths as were not addicted to hunt∣ing
and horses, which began to be a prevail∣ing
taste, were corrupted by a commerce of
barlots, who had reduced their profession into
<HI>system,</HI> while their minds were still more pol∣luted
by the licentious philosophy of the So∣phists.
It is unnecessary to croud the picture;
vices and extravagance took root in Athens in
an administration the most splendid and prospe∣rous.'</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="354"/>
Perhaps, this last observation is cleared up
by the remarks of Marville; for it appears
that, although at the helm of administration
sat such illustrious characters, they had little
or no share in the administration, since the
haughtiness and volatility of the Athenians
were such, that they would not even bear the
reprimands of their Orators.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that even the Me∣chanics
in Athens possessed a classic taste, and a
niceness of ear, which could only be the ef∣fect
of a general diffusion of national ele∣gance.
For an anecdote of their <HI>Atticism,</HI> take
this.</P>
<P>Philip of Macedon, in the present age,
would have merited the title of a Classical
Scholar. I have already given the noble let∣ter
he wrote to Aristotle on the birth of his
son. The present anecdote will prove, that
he must have been—like the late Frederick—not
less partial to the contemplative Minerva,
than to the armed Pallas. To give a proof of
<PB N="338" REF="355"/>
his generosity, he made a present to the van∣quished
Athenians of five thousand measures
of wheat; but this was not to be given by him
without accompanying it by an oration. While
he was holding his discourse to the people, he
committed a solecism in language, which the
attic ear of an Athenian immediately catching,
he boldly reproved him. 'For this,' the Clas∣sic
Monarch continued, 'I grant you five thou∣sand
more.'</P>

<HEAD>POPE SIXTUS THE FIFTH.</HEAD>
<P>A SINGULAR revolution of fortune hap∣pened
to Pope Sixtus the Fifth. He was ori∣ginally
a swine-herd. When he first came to
Rome, he was constrained to beg alms. Hav∣ing
collected a little silver, he one day stood
deliberating with himself, whether he should
employ it in the purchase of a loaf, which the
keenness of his appetite reminded him would
<PB N="339" REF="356"/>
prove a very agreeable acquisition; or, in a
pair of shoes, which his ten toes terribly com∣plained
of wanting. In this conflict of irre∣solution,
his face betrayed the anxiety of his
mind. A tradesman, who had for some time
observed his embarrassment, asked him the oc∣casion
of it. He told him frankly the cause;
but he did it in so facetious a manner, that the
tradesman resolved to finish his perplexity by
inviting him to a good dinner. When Sixtus
became Pope, he did not forget to return the
dinner to the benevolent tradesman.</P>
<P>To give an instance of his abilities as a Po∣litician.
When he first aspired in his mind to
the Popedom, while he was yet a Cardinal, he
counterfeited illness and old age for several
<HI>years.</HI> During the Conclave, which was as∣sembled
to create a Pope, he continually lean∣ed
on his crutch; and very frequently inter∣rupted
the sage deliberations of the Conclave by
a hollow cough, and violent spitting. This
scheme took so well, that the Cardinals fell
<PB N="340" REF="357"/>
into the trap; and every one thinking that, by
electing Sixtus, he might himself stand a
chance of being in a short time elected, he
was chosen unanimously. Soon after the elec∣tion
was concluded, the new Pope perform∣ed
a <HI>Miracle</HI>: his legs became vigorous; his
body, that had been before curbed, became
firm and erect; his cough was dissipated; and
he shewed, in a short time, of what he was
capable.</P>

<HEAD>THE SENATE OF JESUITS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is to be found, in a book intitled—'Interêts
et Maximes des Princes et des Etats
Souverains, Par M. Le Duc de Rohan; Co∣logne,
1666'—an anecdote concerning the
Jesuits; so much the more curious, as neither
Puffendorf or Vertot have noticed it in their
Histories, though it's authority cannot be
higher. It was probably unknown to them.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="358"/>
When Sigismond, King of Sweden, was
elected King of Poland, he made a treaty with
the States of Sweden, by which he obliged
himself to pass every fifth year in that king∣dom.
In the course of time, being constrain∣ed,
by the wars he had with the Ottoman Court,
with Muscovy, and Tartary, to remain in Po∣land,
to animate, by his presence, the wars he
held with such powerful enemies; he failed,
during fifteen years, of accomplishing his pro∣mise.
To remedy this, in some shape, by the
advice of the Jusuits, who had gained the ascen∣dant
over him, he created a Senate, which was
to reside at Stockholm, composed of forty cho∣sen
Jesuits, to decide on every affair of state.
He published a declaration in their favour; and
presented them with letters-patent, by which
he clothed them with the Royal authority.</P>
<P>While this senate of Jesuits was at Dant∣zic,
waiting for a fair wind to set sail for Stock∣holm,
he published an edict, that they should
receive them as his own Royal person. A
<PB N="342" REF="359"/>
public Council was immediately held. Charles,
the uncle of Sigismond, the Prelates, and the
Lords, resolved to prepare for them a splendid
and magnificent entry.</P>
<P>But, in a private Council, they came to very
contrary resolutions: for the Prince said, he
could not bear that a Senate of Priests should
command, in preference to all the honours and
authority of so many Princes and Lords, na∣tives
of the country. All the others agreed
with him in rejecting this holy Senate. It was
then the Archbishop rose, and said—'Since
Sigismond has disdained to be our King, so also
we must not acknowledge him as such; and
from this moment we should no more consider
ourselves as his subjects. His authority is <HI>in
suspenso,</HI> because he has bestowed it on the
Jesuits who form this Senate. The People
have not yet acknowledged them. In this in∣terval
of resignation on the one side, and as∣sumption
of the other, I dispense you all of the
fidelity the King may claim from you as his
<PB N="343" REF="360"/>
Swedish subjects.' When he had said this,
the Prince of Bithynia, addressing himself to
Prince Charles, uncle of the King, said—'I
own no other King than you; and I believe
you are now obliged to receive us as your af∣fectionate
subjects, and to assist us to chase these
vermin from the state.' All the others joined
him, and acknowledged Charles as their lawful
Monarch.</P>
<P>Having resolved to keep their declaration for
some time secret, they deliberated in what
manner they were to receive and to precede
this Senate in their entry into the harbour,
who were on board a great galleon, which they
had caused to cast anchor two leagues from
Stockholm, that they might enter more mag∣nificently
in the night, when the fire-works
they had prepared would appear to the greatest
advantage. About the time of their reception,
Prince Charles, accompanied by twenty-five
or thirty vessels, appeared before the Senate.
Wheeling about, and forming a caracol of
<PB N="344" REF="361"/>
ships, they discharged a volley, and emptied
all their cannon on the galleon of this Senate,
which had it's sides pierced through with the
balls. The galleon was immediately filled
with water, and sunk, without one of the un∣fortunate
Jesuits being assisted; on the con∣trary,
they cried to them, that this was the
time to perform some miracle, such as they
were accustomed to do in India and Japan;
and, if they chose, they could walk on the
waters!</P>
<P>The report of the cannon, and the smoke
which the powder occasioned, prevented either
the cries or the submersion of the Holy Fathers
from being observed: and, as if they were con∣ducting
the Senate to the town, Charles en∣tered
triumphantly; went into the church,
where they sung <HI>Te Deum</HI>; and, to conclude
the night, he partook of the entertainment
which had been prepared for the ill-fated
Senate.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="362"/>
The Jesuits of the city of Stockholm hav∣ing
come, about midnight, to pay their respects
to the Fathers of the Senate, perceived their
loss: they directly posted up <HI>placards</HI> of ex∣communication
against Charles and his adhe∣rents,
who had caused the Senate to perish.
They solicited the people to rebel; but they
were soon chased from the city, and Charles
made a public profession of Lutheranism.</P>
<P>Sigismond, King of Poland, began a war
with Charles in 1604, which lasted two years.
Disturbed by the invasions of the Tartars, the
Muscovites, and the Cossacks, a truce was con∣cluded.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORICAL MISREPRESENTATION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a passion existing in the heart of
man that I am at a loss whether to consider as
proceeding from an excess of malevolence, or
an excess of patriotism. This passion cannot
bear even that the hero of a rival nation should
be found to merit praise, though an interval of
a thousand years may have elapsed since his
days! Whole histories have been written in
<PB N="347" REF="364"/>
this style, where the historian has set out with
a resolution of detracting from, or denying,
the merits of a rival nation. To give an in∣stance
in modern times—</P>
<P>A French writer has wilfully misrepresented
the famous anecdote recorded of our Canute,
and endeavoured to convey an idea that we
have ever been a nation of haughty barbarians.
It cannot be ignorance, but wilful misrepre∣sentation.
The anecdote was never related
but in one manner, and which reflects great
honour on our ancient Monarch. The author
attempts to prove, that the English nation have
been overbearing from the remotest times; and
this he instances by giving the anecdote of
Canute in this senseless narration—</P>
<P>' Canute, King of England, imitating his
predecessors, who called themselves Lords and
Sovereigns of the sea, resolved to take possession
of this title solemnly, that, in future times, it
should not be contested. Persuaded that he
could not render this act more authentic than
<PB N="348" REF="365"/>
by obliging the sea itself to come and pay him
homage, as to it's Sovereign, about the time of
the tide, he raised his throne by the sea-side;
and there, apparelled in his royal robes, he held
this language to the sea, when it rolled to∣wards
him—"Know, that thou art subjected
to me: the earth on which I sit is mine; and
that, till now, none has ever dared to revolt
from my will. I command thee, then, that
thou remain where thou art, without daring
to approach thy Lord, and soil his robes!"
Scarce had he concluded this speech, when a
wave overturned his throne; and, having
wetted him from his head to his feet, taught
him in what manner he was to rely on the
obedience of this element.'</P>
<P>Who does not here immediately perceive,
that, to throw out a satirical stroke on the
English nation for their naval power, the au∣thor
has wilfully disguised this famous reproof
of Canute to his courtiers, and endeavoured to
<PB N="349" REF="366"/>
turn into ridicule the pride and the boast of the

<HEAD>THE ITALIANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of the Italians, even so late
as in the last century, presents a melancholy
contemplation to the Philosopher. How are
we to account for a whole nation being infected
with some of the darkest passions that stain the
human soul? Atheism and Debauchery per∣vaded
every rank; and the hand of the Italian
continually grasped the dagger and the drug.
What yet heightens the enormity of these
crimes, is the 'immortal hatred'—to make use
of a poetical expression—which characterized
this Nation of Assassins. Naudé, who draws
his remarks from personal observation, with
one or two anecdotes, will inform the reader
that these censures are not unjust.</P>
<P>' Italy is crouded with those kinds of men
<PB N="350" REF="367"/>
who penetrate as far into Nature as their abi∣lities
permit them; and, having done this,
will believe nothing more. To trace God, in
the disorder in which the world is now, we
must possess modesty and humility. Italy
abounds with Libertines and Atheists; yet the
number of their writers, who have written on
the Immortality of the Soul, is incredible.
But I am apt to think that those very writers
believe no more than the rest: for I hold this
maxim certain, that <HI>the doubt</HI> in which they
are in is one of the first causes that obliges
them to write; and add, also, that all their
writings are so feeble, that no one can
strengthen, by their sentiments, his faith.
Thus, instead of instructing, they make a
reader perfectly sceptical.</P>
<P>'Italy is a country, at the same time, full
of Impostures and Superstitions: some do not
believe enough, and others believe every thing.
Every day, without truth, and without reason,
miracles take place. I remember that a cer∣tain
<PB N="351" REF="368"/>
poor man was nearly drowned, and was
drawn out of the water almost dead. He re∣covered;
and his recovery was firmly believed to
be, because he happened to have in his chaplet
a medal of Saint Philip of Neri. I did not see
any thing miraculous in this, I said; and that
it certainly was not always a miracle when a
man escaped from being drowned: nor did I
believe that Saint Philip thought one moment
concerning the fate of this man.</P>
<P>' It is but three months since, that the church
of this new saint fell in at Trepani, when more
than a dozen of the congregation, who were
invoking his favours, got wounded and killed.
It was then, rather, that the saint should have
shewn his miraculous powers, and have faved
those good Christians who were supplicating
God and his saintship. Had this been the case,
it would have turned out an excellent Miracle,
and, what few Miracles are accompanied by,
have had a considerable number of witnesses to
verify it.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="369"/>
' The Italians are an agreeable people
enough; but, too frequently, they are found
vindictive and treacherous. Revenge and trea∣chery
are the great sins of the Italians and the
Easterns; and they poison to the very mice in
their houses.</P>
<P>' It is a maxim received into the politics of
this country, however it may be inimical to
the laws of Christianity, that it is best to de∣fend
and to avenge ourselves before worse hap∣pens.
As they have great sense, they will never
offend you; but they will never pardon you,
if you offend them; and they will pursue their
revenge, after an interval of fifty years has
elapsed since the offence had been first given.
They have this Proverb much in esteem—'<HI>Chi
offende, non perdona mai.</HI>'</P>
<P>Descartes, in one of his Letters, writes thus—'Be not so desirous to live under Italian skies;
there is a contagion that poisons it's breezes;
the heat of the day kindles a fever in the deli∣cate
frame; the evening airs are unwholesome;
<PB N="353" REF="370"/>
and the deep shades of the night <HI>conceal</HI> rob∣beries
and assassinations!'</P>
<P>The following anecdotes of Italian revenge
are of good authority. An Italian feigned to
be reconciled with one who had offended him.
One evening, when they walked out together
in a retired spot, the Italian seized him by the
back; and, drawing a dagger, threatened to
stab him if he did not abjure, and curse the
Creator. The other, in vain, entreated that he
might not be obliged to commit what he felt a
horror in doing; but, to save his life, at length
he complied. The assassin, having now com∣pleated
his wish, plunged the poignard in his
bosom; and exultingly exclaimed, that he had
revenged himself in the most dreadful manner
possible; for he had caused the body and the soul
of his enemy to perish at a single stroke!</P>
<P>One Giuseppe Bertoldo, after an absence
of ten years, hearo that a person who had
served him an ill turn, resided in flourishing
circumstances at India. He embarks directly;
<PB N="354" REF="371"/>
he arrives; he follows him closely for two
years; and, at length, having found him one
day alone, and unarmed, in a solitary spot, he
assassinates him.</P>
<P>There is a narration, written in Italian, in a
manuscript in the French King's Library,
tacked to the end of a Volume intitled—'<HI>Le
glorie degl' incogniti di Padoua.</HI>' It displays a
chain of treachery dishonourable to the human
character. I had prepared a translation of this
singular transaction; but, as I now find that
Mr. Andrews has just given it in the Adden∣da
to his Anecdotes, I refer the reader to that
publication. In Addison's Travels, there is an
account of an assassination in Italy, not less re∣markable
than those we have noticed. I shall
add an instance of <HI>poisoning,</HI> which cannot fail
to interest the reader of sensibility.</P>
<P>Francis of Medicis, after the death of his
lady, fell deeply in love with a young noble
Venetian, named Bianca Capella, whom he
married. This lady, who passionately loved
<PB N="355" REF="372"/>
the Duke her husband, was the cause of his
death; attempting to revenge herself <HI>à l'Itali∣enne</HI>—as my Author expresses it—of a Prince
who was a relation of Francis. She had, with
this design, poisoned some olives that were to
have been presented to him. Francis, having
met the servant, took two, and eat them: very
shortly after, he began to feel their mortal ef∣fects.
Bianca Capella, who now saw the
mistake that had taken place, and the <HI>qui pro
quo</HI> that had caused the death of her beloved
Duke, took also of the same olives; and, hav∣ing
swallowed them, she threw herself on the
bed, embracing her dying Lord, and expired
in his arms.</P>

<HEAD>CRITICAL HISTORY OF POVERTY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Morin has formed a little History of
Poverty, which I shall endeavour to abridge.</P>
<P>It is difficult precisely to fix on the epoch
of Poverty, or to mark with accuracy the mo∣ment
<PB N="356" REF="373"/>
of it's birth. Chronologists are silent;
and those who have formed genealogies of the
Gods, have not noticed this Deity's, though
she has been admitted as such in the Pagan
heaven, and has had temples and altars on
earth. The Fabulists have pleasingly narrated
of her, that at the feast which Jupiter gave on
the birth of Venus, she modestly stood at the
gate of the palace, to gather the remains of the
celestial banquet; when she observed Plutus,
the God of Riches, inebriated, not with wine,
but with nectar, roll out of the heavenly resi∣dence;
and, passing into the Olympian gar∣dens,
he threw himself on a vernal bank. She
seized this opportunity to become familiar
with the God. The frolicksome Deity ho∣noured
her with his caresses; and, from this
amour sprung the God of Love, who resem∣bles
his father in jollity and mirth, and his
mother in his nudity. This fabulous narration
is taken from the divine Plato. Let us now turn
to it's historic extraction.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="374"/>
Poverty, though of remote antiquity, did
not exist from the earliest times. In the first
Age, distinguished by the epithet of the Golden,
it certainly was unknown. In the terrestrial
Paradise it never entered. This Age, how∣ever,
had but the duration of a flower: when
it finished, Poverty began to appear. The
ancestors of the human race, if they did not
meet her face to face, knew her in a partial de∣gree.
She must have made a rapid progress
at the time of Cain; for Josephus informs us,
he scoured the country with a banditti. Pro∣ceeding
from this obscure period, it is certain
she was firmly established in the Patriarchal
age. It is then we hear of Merchants, who
publicly practised the commerce of vending
slaves, which indicates the utmost degree of
Poverty. She is distinctly marked by Job:
this holy man protests, that he had nothing to
reproach himself with respecting the Poor, for
he had assisted them in their necessities.</P>
<P>As we advance in the Scriptures, we ob∣serve
<PB N="358" REF="375"/>
the Legislators paid great attentions to
their relief. Moses, by his wise precautions,
endeavoured to soften the rigours of this un∣happy
state. The division of lands, by tribes
and families; the septennial jubilees; the re∣gulation
to bestow, at the harvest-time, a certain
portion of all the fruits of the earth for those
families who were in want; and the obliga∣tion
of his moral law, to love one's neighbour
as one's self; were so many mounds erected
against the inundations of Poverty. It was
thus that the Jews, under their Aristocratic
government, had few or no Mendicants.—Their Kings were unjust; and, rapaciously seiz∣ing
on inheritances which were not their right,
increased the numbers of the poor. From the
reign of David, there were oppressive gover∣nors,
who devoured the people as their bread. It
was still worse under the foreign powers of
Babylon, of Persia, and the Roman Em∣perors.
Such were the extortions of their Pub∣licans,
and the avarice of their Governors, that
<PB N="359" REF="376"/>
the number of Mendicants was dreadfully
augmented; and, it was probably for that
reason that the opulent families consecrated
a tenth part of their property for their suc∣cours,
as appears in the time of the Evange∣lists.
In the preceding ages, no more was
given—as their Casuists assure us—than the
fortieth, or thirtieth part; a custom which this
unfortunate nation to the present hour preserve
and look on it as an indispensible duty; so
much so, that if there are no poor of their na∣tion
where they reside, they send it to the most
distant parts. The Jewish merchants always
make this charity a regular charge in their
transactions with each other; and, at the close
of the year, render an account to the poor of
their nation.</P>
<P>By the example of Moses, the ancient Legi∣slators
were taught to pay a similar attention
to their poor. Like him, they published laws
respecting the division of lands; and many
ordinances were made for the benefit of those
<PB N="360" REF="377"/>
whom fires, inundations, wars, or bad harvests,
had reduced to want. Convinced that <HI>idleness</HI>
more inevitably introduced poverty than any
other cause, they punished it rigorously. The
Egyptians made it criminal; and no vaga∣bonds
or medicants were suffered, under any
pretence whatever. Those who were con∣victed
of slothfulness, and still refused to labour
for the public, when labours were offered to
them, were punished with death. It was the
Egyptian task-masters who observed that the
Israelites were an idle nation, and obliged them
to furnish bricks for the erection of those fa∣mous
pyramids, which are the works of men
who otherwise had remained vagabonds and
mendicants.</P>
<P>The same spirit inspired Greece. Lycurgus
would not have in his republic either <HI>poor</HI> or
<HI>rich:</HI> they lived and laboured in common.
As, in the present times, every family has it's
stores and cellars; so they had public ones, and
distributed the provisions according to the ages
<PB N="361" REF="378"/>
and constitutions of the people. If the same
regulation was not precisely observed by the
Athenians, the Corinthians, and the other
people of Greece, the same maxim existed in
full force against idleness.</P>
<P>According to the laws of Draco, Solon, &amp;c.
a conviction of wilful poverty was punished
with the loss of life. Plato, more gentle in
his manners, would have them only banished.
He calls them enemies of the state; and pro∣nounces,
as a maxim, that where there are
great numbers of mendicants, fatal revolutions
will happen; for, as these people have nothing
to lose, they seize and plan opportunities to dis∣turb
the public repose.</P>
<P>The ancient Romans, whose universal object
was the public prosperity, were not indebted to
Greece on this head. One of the principal
occupations of their Censors was to keep a
watch on the vagabonds. Those who were
condemned as incorrigible sluggards, were sent
to the mines, or made to labour on the public
<PB N="362" REF="379"/>
edifices. The Romans of those times, unlike
the present race, did not consider the <HI>far niento</HI>
as a pleasing occupation: they were convinced,
that their liberalities were ill-placed in bestow∣ing
them on such men. The little republics
of the <HI>Bees</HI> and the <HI>Ants</HI> were often held out
as an example; and the last, particularly,
where Virgil says, that they have elected over∣seers,
who correct the sluggards—<Q><L>—Pars agmina cogunt</L>
<L>Castigant que moras.</L><BIBL>VIRGIL.</BIBL></Q>

And, if we may trust the narratives of our tra∣vellers,
the <HI>Beavers</HI> pursue this regulation
more rigorously and exact than even these in∣dustrious
societies. But their rigour, although
but animals, is not so barbarous as that of the
ancient Germans; who, Tacitus informs us,
plunged the idlers and vagabonds in the
thickest mire of their marshes, and left them
to perish by a kind of death that resembled
their inactive dispositions.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="380"/>
Yet, after all, it was not inhumanity that
prompted the ancients thus severely to chastise
idleness: they were induced to it by a strict
equity; and it would be doing them injustice
to suppose, that it was thus they treated those
<HI>unfortunate poor</HI> whose indigence was occa∣sioned
by infirmities, by age, or unforeseen
calamities. They, perhaps, exceeded us in
genuine humanity. Every family constantly
assisted it's branches, to save them from being
reduced to beggary; which, to them, appeared
worse than death. The magistrates protected
those who were destitute of friends, or inca∣pable
of labour. When Ulysses was disguised
as a mendicant, and presented himself to Eury∣machus,
this Prince, observing him to be ro∣bust
and healthy, offered to give him employ∣ment,
or otherwise to leave him to his ill for∣tune.
When the Roman Emperors, even in
the reigns of Nero and Tiberius, bestowed their
largesses, the distributors were ordered to ex∣cept
those from receiving a share whose bad
<PB N="364" REF="381"/>
conduct kept them in misery; for that it was
better the lazy should die with hunger than be
fed in idleness.</P>
<P>Whether the police of the ancients was more
exact, or whether they were more attentive to
practise the duties of humanity, or that slavery
served as an efficacious corrective of idleness;
it clearly appears how little was the misery,
and how few the numbers, of their poor. This
they did, too, without having recourse to hos∣pitals.</P>
<P>At the establishment of Christianity, when
the Apostles commanded a community of riches
among their disciples, the miseries of the poor
became alleviated in a greater degree. If they
did not absolutely live together, as we have
seen religious orders, yet the rich continually
supplied their distressed brethren: but matters
greatly changed under Constantine. This
Prince, with the best intentions, published
edicts in favour of those Christians who had
been condemned, in the preceding reigns, to
<PB N="365" REF="382"/>
slavery, to the mines, the galleys, or prisons.
The Church felt an inundation of prodigious
crowds of these unhappy men, who brought
with them urgent wants and corporeal in∣firmities.
The Christian families formed then
but a few: they could not satisfy these men.
The magistrates protected them: they built
spacious hospitals, under different titles, for
the sick, the aged, the invalids, the widows,
and orphans. The Emperors, and the most
eminent personages, were seen in these hos∣pitals,
examining the patients. Sometimes
they assisted the helpless, and sometimes dressed
the wounded. This did so much honour to the
new religion, that Julian the Apostate intro∣duced
this custom among the Pagans. But
the best things are seen continually per∣verted.</P>
<P>These retreats were found not sufficient.
Many slaves, proud of the liberty they had
just recovered, looked on them as prisons;
and, under various pretexts, wandered about
<PB N="366" REF="383"/>
the country. They displayed, with art, the
scars of their former wounds, and exposed the
imprinted marks of their chains. They found
thus a lucrative profession in begging, which
had been interdicted by the laws. The pro∣fession
did not finish with them: men of an
untoward, turbulent, and licentious disposi∣tion,
gladly embraced it. It spread so wide,
that the succeeding Emperors were obliged to
institute new laws; and it was permitted to
individuals to seize on these mendicants for
their slaves and perpetual vassals: a powerful
preservative against this disorder. It is ob∣served
in almost every part of the world but
ours; and it is thus that nowhere they so
abound with beggars. China presents us with
a noble example. No beggars are seen loiter∣ing
in their country. All the world are occu∣pied,
even to the blind and the lame. Those
who are incapable of labour, live at the public
expence. What is done <HI>there,</HI> may also be
performed <HI>here.</HI> Then, instead of that hide∣ous,
<PB N="367" REF="384"/>
importunate, idle, licentious poverty—as
pernicious to the police as to morality—we
should see the poverty of the earlier ages hum∣ble,
modest, frugal, robust, industrious, and
laborious. Then, indeed, the fable of Plato
might be realized: Poverty may be embraced
by the god of riches; and, if she did not pro∣duce
the vuluptuous offspring of Love, she
would become the fertile mother of Agricul∣ture,
and the ingenious mother of the fine
Arts, and of all kinds of Manufactures.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>SLAVERY.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE chiefly collected the present Anec∣dotes
from the ingenious Compiler of <HI>L'Esprit
des Usages et des Coutumes.</HI>'</P>
<P>It avails little to exclaim against Slavery; it
is an evil so natural to man, that it is impos∣sible
totally to eradicate it. Man will be a ty∣rant;
<PB N="368" REF="385"/>
and, if he possessed an adequate strength,
he would enslave whatever surrounded him.
Dominion is so flattering to pride, and to idle∣ness,
that it is impossible to sacrifice it's enjoy∣ments.
Even the Slave himself requires to be
attended by another Slave: it is thus with the
Negro of Labat; who, since his state permits
of none, assumes a despotic authority over his
wife and children.</P>
<P>There are Slaves even with savages; and, if
force cannot establish servitude, they employ
other means to supply it. The Chief of the
<HI>Natchès</HI> of Louisiana disposes at his will of
the property of his subjects: they dare not
even refuse him their head. He is a perfect
despotic prince. When the presumptive heir
is born, the people devote to him all the chil∣dren
at the breast, to serve him during his life.
This petit Chief is a very Sesostris; he is treated
in his cabin as the Emperor of China is in his
palace. Indeed, the origin of his power is
great: the <HI>Natchès</HI> adore the Sun, and this
<PB N="369" REF="386"/>
Sovereign has palmed himself on them for the
Brother of the Sun!</P>
<P>Servitude is sometimes as pleasing to the
slave as it is gratifying to the master; and can
any thing more strongly convince us, that the
greater part of men are unworthy of tasting
the sweets of liberty? It was thus, when the
Monarchs of France were desirous of despoiling
the Barons of the authority they had usurped,
the bondmen, accustomed to slavery, were slow
in claiming their liberty. To effect this, it be∣came
necessary to <HI>compel</HI> them by laws; and
Louis Hutin ordered, that those villains, or
bondmen, who would not be enfranchised,
should pay heavy fines.</P>
<P>The origin of Slavery, in some countries,
arises from singular circumstances. If a Tar∣tar
met in his way a man, or woman, who
could not shew a passport from the King, he
would seize on the person as his right and
property.</P>
<P>Formerly, in Circassia, when the husband
<PB N="370" REF="387"/>
and wife did not agree, they went to complain
to the governor of the town. If the husband
was the first who arrived, the governor caused
the woman to be seized on and sold, and gave
another to the husband; and, on the contrary,
he seized on and sold the husband, if the wife
arrived the first.</P>
<P>Liberality, and the desire of obliging—who
could credit it?—occasion the depriving others
of their liberty. An Islander of Mindanao, who
redeems his son from Slavery, makes him his
own slave; and children exercise the same be∣nevolence
and rigour on their parents.</P>
<P>In Rome, the debtor became the slave of his
creditor; and, when it happened that they could
take nothing from him who had lost every
thing, they took his liberty. It is even believed,
that the law of the Twelve Tables permitted
them to cut into pieces an insolvent debtor!</P>
<P>It is since the establishment of the commerce
and sale of Negroes, that men have committed
the most enormous crimes. The Mulattoes
<PB N="371" REF="388"/>
of Loanda seduce the young women wherever
they pass: they return to them, some years
afterwards; and, under the pretext of giving
the children a better education, they carry them
off to sell them.</P>
<P>Thus, also, the women of Benguela, in col∣lusion
with their husbands, allure other men
to their arms. The husband falls suddenly on
them, imprisons the unfortunate gallants, and
sells them the first opportunity; and he is not
punished for these violences.</P>
<P>Besides, the Negroes sell their children, their
parents, and their neighbours! They lead to
the country-house of the merchant their unsu∣spicious
victims, and there deliver them into
the hands of their purchaser. While they are
loaded with chains, and separated for ever from
their most endearing connections, it is in vain
they raise loud and melancholy cries: the infa∣mous
vender smiles, and says it is only a cunning
trick. Le Maire informs us, that an old Ne∣gro
resolved to sell his son: but the son, who
<PB N="372" REF="389"/>
suspected his design, hastened to the factor;
and, having taken him aside, sold him his
father!</P>
<P>The Islanders of Bissagos are passionately
fond of spirituous liquors; and, on the arrival
of a vessel, the weakest, without distinction of
age, friendship, or relationship, become the
prey of the strongest, that they may sell them
to purchase liquors.</P>
<P>It appears that, in the East, and particularly
at Batavia, the life of a slave entirely depends
on the caprices of his master: the slightest
fault brings on him the most afflicting treat∣ment.
They bind him to a gallows; they
flog him unmercifully with splitted canes; his
blood flows in a stream, and his body is co∣vered
with wounds: but, fearful that he may
not die in sufficient tortures, they scatter abun∣dantly
over them salt and pepper. So little
care is paid to these unfortunate men amongst
the Maldivians, that they lie entirely at the
mercy of every one. Those who practise on
<PB N="373" REF="390"/>
them any ill treatment, receive only half the
punishment that the laws exact from any one
who had ill-treated a free person. The slightest
chastisement which is inflicted on them, at
Java, is to carry about their necks a piece of
wood, with a chain, and which they are con∣demned
to drag all their lives.</P>
<P>The slaves of the kingdom of Angola, and
many other countries of Africa, never address
their masters but on their knees. They do
not even allow them the honours of decent
burial; they throw their bodies in the woods,
where they become the food of wild beasts.</P>
<P>If those on the Gold Coast escape, and are
retaken, they lose an ear for the first offence
of this kind: a second offence is punished with
the loss of the other. At the third, it is al∣lowed
their masters either to sell them to the
Europeans, or to cut off their heads.</P>
<P>Religious fanaticism increases the inhumanity
of the pirates of Africa. The Moors and the
Europeans reciprocally detest each other; and,
<PB N="374" REF="391"/>
since they redeem their captives, the Mahome∣tans
have become unmerciful, that they may
the more powerfully excite their friends to re∣deem
them with heavy ransoms. We must
not credit every thing Historians record; but
it is certain that the police does not punish the
master who kills his slaves; that religious pre∣judices
totally stifle the feelings of humanity;
and that the zealous Mussulman inflicts con∣tinual
tortures on these unfortunate men, that
they may abjure their religion.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, and the Knights of Malta,
for their reprisals, chain to the galley all the
Mahometans they make prisoners; and, it is
thus that the fate of the Christian slaves on the
Northern Coast of Africa, is the natural con∣sequence
of a war which never can termi∣nate.</P>
<P>When the NEGROES of the Colonies solely
depend on a brutal master, who can paint the
horrors of their situation? Without dwelling
on the cruelties which they suffer in Africa,
<PB N="375" REF="392"/>
before they are sold, and during the voyage;
the greater part believe, that, after their em∣barkment
from America, the Europeans intend
to massacre them in the most terrible manner
imaginable: to burn, calcine, and pulverize
their bones, to be employed as gunpowder;
and they also imagine, that the Europeans
manufacture an oil with their fat and marrow.</P>
<P>If they do not finish their task, they are
lashed with rods till they are covered with
blood. Sometimes they pour over their raw
wounds a pound of melted pitch; and some∣times
they heighten their unsupportable smart
by scattering over them handfuls of pepper!</P>
<P>The habit of suffering endows them with
an admirable patience. It is thus <HI>Labat</HI> ex∣presses
himself on this head. 'They are sel∣dom
heard to cry out, or to complain. It is
not owing to insensibility, for their flesh is ex∣tremely
delicate, and their feelings irritable.
It proceeds from an uncommon magnanimity
of soul, which sets at defiance pain, grief,
<PB N="376" REF="393"/>
and death itself. I have more than once seen
some broken on the wheel, and others torment∣ed
by the most dreadful machines inventive
cruelty could produce, without their giving
vent to one murmur, or shedding one tear. I
saw a Negro burnt, who was so far from being
affected, that he called for a little lighted to∣bacco,
on his way to the place of execution;
and I observed him smoak with great calmness,
at the moment his feet were consuming in the
midst of the flames. There were two Negroes
condemned; the one to the gallows, the other
to be whipped by the hand of the executioner.
The Priest, in a mistake, confessed him who
was not to have died. They did not perceive
it, till the moment the executioner was going
to throw him off; they made him descend; the
other was confessed; and, although he expect∣ed
only to be whipped, he mounted the ladder
with as much indifference as the first descend∣ed
from it, and as if the choice of either fate
was alike to him.'</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="394"/>
How grievous must be the unfortunate de∣stiny
of those Negroes, when they possess a
soul so great, and sentiments so sublime! At∣kins,
examining once some slaves, observed
one of a noble slature, who appeared to him
not less vigorous than imperious; he glanced
on his companions, whenever they murmured
or wept, looks of reproach and disdain. He
never turned his eyes on the overseer; and,
if commanded to rise, or to stretch his
leg, he did not by any means immediately
obey. His exasperated master wearied him∣self
with lashing his naked body with his rod.
He was going to dispatch him in his fury, had
it not been observed to him, that if he sold him,
he might get an uncommon price for a slave of
his appearance. The Negro supported this
persecution with heroic intrepidity; he pre∣served
a rigid silence; a tear or two only trick∣led
down his cheek; when, as if he blushed
for his weakness, he turned aside to hide them.
'I learnt,' Atkins writes, 'that he was a Chief
<PB N="378" REF="395"/>
of some villages who had just come from op∣posing
the slave-traffic of the English.' Mr.
Mackenzie, in one of his Novels, has de∣scribed
this scene with the pen of a Master; and
certainly draws the picture after the description
of Atkins.</P>
<P>Many European nations abandon the Ne∣groes
to the caprice of their masters, or to the
despotic decision of the Magistrate. The
French have drawn up some regulations, which
have been called <HI>the Black Code.</HI> This article
trespasses so much on our usual limits, that we
cannot extract any for the contemplation of
the reader; let it be sufficient, however, to ob∣serve,
that they are eternal records of Euro∣pean

<HEAD>A NEW RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the world knows how successful some
impostors have been in the establishment of
Religions. We Europeans are well persuaded,
that the Jewish and the Christian are derived
from Divine authority. We are perfectly satis∣fied
that Mahomet, Manco Capac, Confucius,
the Lama of Tartary, are impostors. Though
a greater number of nations respect <HI>their</HI> va∣rious
holy scriptures than the true Bible, as
voyagers have made new discoveries, new Re∣ligions
have been discovered. The list of re∣ligious
impostors it is not difficult to augment.
The Jews have seen five or six fictitious Mes∣siahs—Sabbatei Sevi the most remarkable of
them. I am convinced, that not a few Re∣ligions
<PB N="380" REF="397"/>
have failed in their establishment; and
I will oppose to these impostors a man, who
was more learned and able than any of them.
But circumstances were not favourable to his
system: he had not, like Mahomet, to join with
his Alcoran, a good armoury of swords in his
possession.</P>
<P>About the middle of the fifteenth century,
some time before the Turks had become ma∣sters
of Constantinople, a great number of
Philosophers flourished. <HI>Gemistus Plethon</HI>
was one distinguished by the excellence of his
genius, by the depth of his erudition, and
chiefly by his being a warm Platonist. Such
were his eminent abilities, that, in his old age,
those whom his novel system had greatly irri∣tated,
either feared or respected him. He had
scarcely breathed his last moments, when they
began to abuse Plato and our Plethon. Here
is an account, written by George of Trebi∣zond—</P>
<P>' There has lately arose, amongst us, a second
<PB N="381" REF="398"/>
Mahomet; and this second, if we do not take
care, will exceed in greatness the first, by the
dreadful consequences of his wicked doctrine,
as the first has exceeded Plato. A disciple and
rival of this Philosopher, in philosophy, in
eloquence, and in science, he had fixed his re∣sidence
in the Peloponnese. His common name
was <HI>Gemistus,</HI> but he assumed that of <HI>Plethon.</HI>
Perhaps Gemistus, to make us believe more
easily that he was descended from heaven, and
to engage us to receive more readily his doc∣trine
and his new law, wished to change his
name, according to the manner of the ancient
patriarchs; of whom it is said, that at the time
the name was changed they were called to the
greatest things. He has writen with wonder∣ful
art, and with great elegance. He has given
new rules for the conduct of life, and for the
regulation of human affairs; and, at the same
time, has vomited forth a great number of blas∣phemies
against the Catholic religion. It is cer∣tain,
he was so zealous a Platonist, that he enter∣tained
<PB N="382" REF="399"/>
no other sentiments than those of Plato,
concerning the nature of the Gods, Souls,
Sacrifices, &amp;c. I have heard him, myself,
when we were together at Florence, say that,
in a few years, all men on the face of the
earth would embrace, with one common con∣sent,
and with one mind, a single and simple
religion, at the first instructions which should
be given by a single preaching. And when I
asked him, if it would be the religion of Jesus
Christ, or that of Mahomet? he answered,
"Neither one nor the other; but a <HI>third,</HI>
which will not greatly differ from <HI>Paganism.</HI>"
These words I heard with so much indignation,
that since that time I have always hated him:
I look upon him as a dangerous viper; and I
cannot think of him without abhorrence.'</P>
<P>The pious writer of this account is too vio∣lently
agitated: he might, perhaps, have be∣stowed
a smile of pity, or contempt; but the
bigots of religion are not less insane than the
impious themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="400"/>
It was when Plethon died, that the malice
of his enemies collected all it's venom. We
cannot but acknowledge, from this circum∣stance,
that his abilities must have been astonish∣ingly
vast, to have kept such crowds silent:
and, it is not improbable, this scheme of
impiety was less impious than the majority
of the people imagined. Not a few Catholic
writers lament that his Book was burnt, and
greatly regret the loss of Plethon's work;
which, they say, was not meant to subvert the
Christian religion, but only to unfold the system
of Plato, and to collect what he and other
Philosophers had written on Religion and Poli∣ticks.
At the same time, however, we must
recollect the express words of Plethon, which
we come from transcribing as given us by
George of Trebizond.</P>
<P>Of his religious scheme, the reader may now
judge, by this summary account. The general
title of the volume ran thus—'This Book
treats of the Laws, of the best Form of Go∣vernment,
<PB N="384" REF="401"/>
and what all Men must observe in
their public and private Stations, to live toge∣ther
in the most perfect, the most innocent,
and the most happy Manner.' The whole was
divided into Three Books. The titles of the
chapters, where Paganism was openly incul∣cated,
are reported by Gennadius, who con∣demned
it to the flames, but who has not
thought proper to enter into the manner of his
arguments, &amp;c. The impiety and the extra∣vagance
of this new Legislator appeared, above
all, in the articles which concerned Religion.
He acknowledges a plurality of gods: some
superior, whom he placed above the heavens;
and the others, inferior, on this side the hea∣vens.
The first, existing from the remotest
antiquity; the others younger, and of different
ages. He gave a King to all these gods; and
he called him ΖΕΥΣ—or <HI>Jupiter</HI>—as the Pagans
named this power formerly. According to
him, the Stars had a Soul; the Demons were
not malignant Spirits; and the World was
<PB N="385" REF="402"/>
eternal. He established Polygamy; and was
even inclined to a community of women. All
his work was filled with such follies; and with
not a few impieties, which my pious Author
will not venture to give.</P>
<P>What the intentions of Plethon were, it
would be rash and ungenerous in us to deter∣mine.
If the work was only an arrangement
of the Heathen notions, it was an innocent
and curious volume. It is allowed, that he was
uncommonly learned and humane, and had
not passed his life entirely in the solitary re∣cesses
of his study.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this article, without recollect∣ing
two similar works even of the present day.
The ideas of the phrenetic <HI>Emanuel Sweden∣burgh</HI>
are warmly cherished by a sect, who have
so far disgraced themselves as to bestow on their
society the name of this man. It is but very
lately that a work was published, by a Mr. T.
Taylor, who openly professed Paganism! A
book published by the <HI>Athenian Stuart,</HI> as he
<PB N="386" REF="403"/>
is called, is not less to be distinguished—Yet
we have only <HI>one</HI> hospital dedicated to Saint
Luke in this metropolis!</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Edward the Fourth was a gay and
voluptuous Prince; and, what is singular, he
probably owed to his enormous debts, and
passion for the fair-sex, his crown. He had
not <HI>one</HI> Jane Shore, but <HI>many.</HI> Hear honest
Philip de Comines, his contemporary. He
says, that what greatly contributed to his en∣tering
London as soon as he appeared at it's
gates, was the great debts this Prince had con∣tracted,
which made his creditors gladly assist
him; and the high favour in which he was
held by the <HI>Bourgeoises,</HI> into whose good graces
he had frequently glided, and who gained him
over their husbands—who, I suppose, for the
<PB N="387" REF="404"/>
tranquillity of their lives, were glad to depose
or raise Monarchs.</P>
<P>These are De Comine's words—'Many
ladies, and rich citizens wives, of whom for∣merly
he had great privacies and familiar ac∣quaintance,
gained over to him their husbands
and relations.'</P>
<P>This is the description of his voluptuous
life: we must recollect, that the writer had been
an eye-witness, and was an honest man; while
modern Historians only view objects through
the coloured medium of their imagination, and
do not always merit the latter appellation.</P>
<P>' He had been, during the last twelve years,
more accustomed to his ease and pleasures than
any other Prince who lived in his time. He
had nothing in his thoughts but <HI>les dames,</HI> and
of them more than was <HI>reasonable</HI>; and hunt∣ing-matches,
good eating, and great care of
his person. When he went, in their seasons,
to these hunting-matches, he always caused to
be carried with him great pavilions for <HI>les</HI><PB N="388" REF="405"/>
<HI>dames</HI>; and, at the same time, gave splendid
entertainments: so that it is not surprizing
that his person was as jolly as any one I ever
saw. He was then young, and as handsome
as any man of his age; but he has since be∣come
enormously fat.'</P>
<P>Since I have got old Philip in my hand, the
reader will not, perhaps, be displeased, if he
attends to a little more of his <HI>naiveté,</HI> which
will appear in the form of a <HI>conversazione</HI> of
the times. He now relates what passed be∣tween
Edward and the King of France—</P>
<P>' When the ceremony of the oath was con∣cluded,
our King, who was desirous of being
friendly, began to say to the King of England,
in a laughing way, that he must come to Paris,
and be jovial amongst our Ladies; and that he
would give him the Cardinal de Bourbon for
his Confessor, who would very willingly ab∣solve
him of any <HI>sin</HI> which perchance he might
commit. The King of England seemed well-pleased
at the invitation, and laughed heartily;
<PB N="389" REF="406"/>
for he knew that the said Cardinal was <HI>un fort
bon compagnon.</HI> When the King was return∣ing,
he spoke on the road to me; and said,
that he did not like to find the King of Eng∣land
so much inclined to come to Paris. "He
is," said he, "a very <HI>handsome</HI> King; he likes
the women too much. He may probably find
one at Paris that may make him like to come
too often, or stay too long. His predecessors
have already been too much at Paris and in
Normandy." And that his company was not
agreeable <HI>this side of the sea</HI>; but that, beyond
the sea, he wished to be <HI>bon frere et amy.</HI>'</P>

<HEAD>A RELIC.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY the Third was deeply tainted with
the vilest superstition. He was a Prince of a
<PB N="390" REF="407"/>
dastardly disposition; and, like all bigots,
endeavoured, by mean subterfuge and low
cunning, to circumvent others: incapable of
that noble frankness which characterizes an
honest man not bigotted to the senseless rites
of superstition. As an instance of his bigotry,
take this account of a Relic which is too
curious to abridge—</P>
<P>' Henry summoned all the great men of
the kingdom, A. D. 1247, to come to London
on the festival of Saint Edward, to receive an
account of a certain sacred benefit which
<HI>Heaven</HI> had lately bestowed on England. The
singular strain of this summons excited the
most eager curiosity, and brought great multi∣tudes
to London at the time appointed. When
they were all assembled in Saint Paul's Church,
the King acquainted them, that the Great
Master of the Knights Templars had sent him,
by one of his Knights, a phial of crystal, contain∣ing
a <HI>small portion of the precious blood of Christ,</HI>
which he had shed upon the <HI>Cross</HI> for the sal∣vation
<PB N="391" REF="408"/>
of the world, <HI>attested to be genuine</HI> by
the seals of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, of
several Archbishops, Bishops, and Abbots.
This, he informed them, he designed to carry,
the next day, in solemn procession, to West∣minster,
attended by them, and by all the
Clergy of London, in their proper habits, with
their banners, crucifixes, and wax-candles;
and exhorted all who were present to prepare
themselves for that sacred solemnity, by spend∣ing
the night in watching, fasting, and devout
exercises. On the morrow, when the pro∣cession
was put in order, the King approached
the sacred phial with <HI>reverence, fear,</HI> and
<HI>trembling</HI>; took it in both his hands; and,
holding it up higher than his face, proceeded
under a canopy, two assistants supporting his
arms. Such was the devotion of Henry on
this occasion, that, though the road between
Saint Paul's and Westminster was very deep
and miry, he kept his eyes constantly <HI>fixed on
the phial,</HI> or on <HI>heaven.</HI> When the procession
<PB N="392" REF="409"/>
approached Westminster, it was met by two
Monks of that Abbey, who conducted it into
the church, where the King deposited the vene∣rable
Relic; which,' says the Historian, 'made
all England shine with glory, dedicating it to
God and Saint Edward.'</P>

Papist under the reign of Henry the Eighth,
and a Protestant under Edward the Sixth; he
was a Papist again under Queen Mary, and at

<HEAD>SPANISH ETIQUETTE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Etiquette—or Rules to be observed in
the royal palaces—is necessary, observes Baron
Bielfield, for keeping order at court. In Spain,
it was carried to such lengths as to make mar∣tyrs
of their Kings. Here is an instance; at
which, in spite of the fatal consequences it
produced, one cannot refrain from smiling—</P>
<P>Philip the Third being <HI>gravely seated</HI>—as
Spaniards generally are—by a chimney where
the fire-maker of the court had kindled so great
a quantity of wood that the Monarch was
nearly suffocated with heat, his <HI>grandeur</HI> would
not suffer him to rise from the chair; and the
domestics could not <HI>presume</HI> to enter the apart∣ment,
because it was against the <HI>Etiquette.</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="411"/>
At length, the Marquis de Potat appeared, and
the King ordered him to damp the fires: but
<HI>he</HI> excused himself; alledging, that he was
forbidden by the <HI>Etiquette</HI> to perform such a
function, for which the Duke D'Usseda ought
to be called upon, as it was his business. The
Duke was gone out; the <HI>fire</HI> burnt fiercer; and
the <HI>King</HI> endured it, rather than derogate from
his <HI>dignity.</HI> But his blood was heated to such
a degree, that an erysipelas broke out in his
head the next day; which, being succeeded
by a violent fever, carried him off in 1621,
and in the twenty-fourth year of his age.</P>
<P>The palace was once on fire; when a soldier,
who knew the King's sister was in her apart∣ment,
and must inevitably have been consumed
in a few moments by the flames, at the risk of
his life, rushed in, and brought her Highness
safe out in his arms: but the Spanish <HI>Etiquette</HI>
was here woefully broken into! The loyal
soldier was brought to trial; and, as it was im∣possible
to deny that he had entered her apart∣ment,
<PB N="395" REF="412"/>
the judges condemned him to die! The
Spanish Princess, however, condescended, in
consideration of the circumstance, to <HI>pardon</HI>
the soldier, and very benevolently saved his
life!</P>

<HEAD>HELL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cardinal Bellarmin, in his Treatise <HI>du
Purgatoire,</HI> seems to be as familiarly acquaint∣ed
with the secret tracks and the formidable di∣visions
of '<HI>the bottomless pit,</HI>' as Swedenburgh
was with the streets and bye-corners of '<HI>the
New Jerusalem.</HI>'</P>
<P>He informs us, that there are, beneath the
earth, four different places, or a profound
<PB N="396" REF="413"/>
place divided into four parts. He says, that
the deepest place is <HI>Hell</HI>; which contains
all the souls of the damned, where will be
also their bodies after the Resurrection, and
where likewise will be inclosed all the Demons.
The place nearest Hell is <HI>Purgatory,</HI> where
souls are purged; or, rather, where they ap∣pease
the anger of God by their sufferings.
He says, that the same fires, and the same
torments, alike afflict in both these places;
and that the only difference between Hell and
Purgatory, consists in their duration. Next to
Purgatory, is the <HI>Limbo</HI> of those <HI>Infants</HI> who
die without having received the Sacrament:
and the fourth place is the <HI>Limbo</HI> of the <HI>Fa∣thers</HI>;
that is to say, of those Just Men who
died before the death of Jesus Christ. But
since the days of the Redeemer, this last divi∣sion

<P>Such ideas are the <HI>tenets</HI> which some, from

by the bigots, that the more ridiculous,

for belief, the greater merit it is to receive it
without hesitation. Men have persuaded them∣selves,
that what bears the strongest evidence
of falshood, is the sacred truth of a pater∣nal

points, they had only <HI>differed</HI> with their

But these bigots have written, in the warm <HI>blood</HI>

have reared an altar to Superstition, on which
they have not sacrificed the Scape-Goat, or the
Paschal Lamb; but they have plunged the sa∣cerdotal

They have agonized the individual
with the flaming <HI>Auto da fés</HI> of the Inquisition:
with a more dreadful scope, they have sent
thousands, with the sword of the Crusade,
to spread desolation in parts which had never

<P>IT may be recorded as a species of Puritanic
savageness and Gothic barbarism, that, no
later than in the year 1757, a Man of Genius

rather elevate the soul, and purify the mind.</P>

<HEAD>THE LOVER'S HEART.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Tale is recorded in the Histo∣rical
Memoirs of Champagne, by Bougier. It
has been a favourite narrative with the old
Romance writers; and the principal incident,
however objectionable, has been displayed in se∣veral
modern poems. It is probable, that the
<HI>true</HI> History will be acceptable, for it's tender
and amorous incident, to the fair reader.</P>
<P>The Lord De Coucy, vassal to the Count De
Champagne, was one of the most accomplished
youths of his time. He loved, with an excess
of passion, the lady of the Lord Du Fayel, who
felt for him reciprocal ardours. It was with
the most poignant grief, this lady heard her
lover acquaint her, that he had resolved to ac∣company
the King and the Count De Cham∣pagne
<PB N="401" REF="418"/>
to the wars of the Holy Land; but she
could not oppose his wishes, because she hop∣ed
that his absence might dissipate the jealousy
of her husband. The time of departure hav∣ing
come, these two lovers parted with sorrows
of the most lively tenderness. The lady, in
quitting her lover, presented him with some
rings, some diamonds, and with a string that
she had woven herself of his own hair, inter∣mixed
with silk and buttons of large pearls,
to serve him, according to the fashion of those
days, to tie a magnificent hood which covered
his helmet. This he gratefully accepted, and
instantly departed.</P>
<P>When he arrived in Palestine, he received at
the siege of Acre, in 1191, in gloriously as∣cending
the ramparts, a wound, which was
declared mortal. He employed the few mo∣ments
he had to live, in writing to the Lady
Du Fayel; and he made use of those fervid
expressions which were natural to him in his
afflictive situation. He ordered his Squire to
<PB N="402" REF="419"/>
embalm his heart after his death, and to con∣vey
it to his beloved mistress, with the pre∣sents
he had received from her hands in quit∣ting
her.</P>
<P>The Squire, faithful to the dying commands
of his master, returned immediately to France,
to present the heart and the presents to the
Lady of Du Fayel. But, when he approached
the castle of this lady, he concealed himself in
the neighbouring wood, till he could find some
favourable moment to compleat his promise.
He had the misfortune to be observed by the
husband of this lady, who recognized him, and
who immediately suspected he came in search
of his wife with some message from his master.
He threatened to deprive him of his life, if he
did not divulge what had occasioned him to
come there. The Squire gave him for answer,
that his master was dead; but Du Fayel not
believing it, drew his sword to murder him.
This man, frightened at the peril in which he
found himself, confessed every thing; and put
<PB N="403" REF="420"/>
into his hands the heart and letter of his ma∣ster.
Du Fayel, prompted by the fellest re∣venge,
ordered his cook to mince the heart;
and, having mixed it with meat, he caused a
ragout to be made, which he knew pleased the
taste of his wife, and had it served to her.
This lady eat greedily of the dish. After the
repast, Du Fayel inquired of his wife, if she
had found the ragout according to her taste:
she answered him, that she had found it excel∣lent.
'It is for this reason,' he replied, 'that
I caused it to be served to you, for it is a kind
of meat which you very much liked. You
have, Madam,' the savage Du Fayel continued,
'eat the heart of the Lord De Coucy.' But this
she would not believe, till he shewed her the
letter of her lover, with the string of his
hair, and the diamonds she had given him.
Then, shuddering in the anguish of her sensa∣tions,
and urged by the darkest despair, she
told him—'It is true that I loved that heart,
because it merited to be loved: for never could
<PB N="404" REF="421"/>
it find it's superior; and, since I have eaten of
so noble a meat, and that my stomach is the
tomb of so precious a heart, I will take care
that nothing of inferior worth shall be mixed
with it.' Grief and passion choaked her ut∣terance.
She retired into her chamber: she
closed the door for ever; and, refusing to ac∣cept
of consolation or food, the amiable victim
expired on the fourth day.</P>

<P>THE present learned and curious disserta∣tion
I have compiled from the papers of an

into the antiquity of this part of dress; and

Some have given them a very early original,
imagining they are noticed in the 108th Psalm,
where the Royal Prophet declares, he will cast
his <HI>Shoe</HI> over Edom. They go still higher;
supposing them to be used in the times of the
Judges, Ruth iv. 7. where it is said, it
was the custom for a man to take off his <HI>Shoe,</HI>
and give it to his neighbour, as a token of re∣deeming
or exchanging any thing. They
tell us, <HI>the word</HI> which in these two texts is
usually translated <HI>Shoe,</HI> is by the Chaldee pa∣raphrast
in the latter, rendered <HI>Glove.</HI> Casaubon
is of opinion, that <HI>Gloves</HI> were worn by the
Chaldeans, because the word here mentioned
is in the Talmud Lexicon explained, <HI>the cloath∣ing
of the hand.</HI> But it must be confessed, all
these are mere conjectures; and the Chaldean
paraphrast has taken an unallowable liberty in
his version.</P>
<P>Let us, then, be content to begin with the
authority of <HI>Xenophon.</HI> He gives a clear and
distinct account of <HI>Gloves.</HI> Speaking of the
<PB N="406" REF="423"/>
manners of the Persians, he gives us a proof
of their effeminacy; that, not satisfied with
covering their head and their feet, they also
guarded their hands against the cold with <HI>thick
Gloves. Homer,</HI> speaking of Laertes at work
in his garden, represents him with <HI>Gloves on
his hands, to secure them from the thorns. Var∣ro,</HI>
an ancient Writer, is an evidence in favour
of their antiquity among the Romans. In Lib.
ii. Cap. 55. <HI>de Re Rustica,</HI> he says, that olives
gathered by the naked hand, are preferable to
those gathered with <HI>Gloves. Athenaeus</HI> speaks
of a celebrated glutton, who always came to
table with <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands, that he might
be able to handle and eat the meat while hot,
and devour more than the rest of the com∣pany.</P>
<P>These authorities shew, that the ancients
were not strangers to <HI>Gloves</HI>; though, perhaps,
their use might not be so common as amongst
us. When the ancient severity of manners
declined, the use of <HI>Gloves</HI> prevailed among
<PB N="407" REF="424"/>
the Romans; but not without some opposition
from the Philosophers. <HI>Musonius,</HI> a Philoso∣pher,
who lived at the close of the first cen∣tury
of Christianity, among other invectives
against the corruption of the age, says, <HI>It is a
shame, that persons in perfect health should clothe
their hands and feet with soft and hairy cover∣ings.</HI>
Their convenience, however, soon made
their use general. <HI>Pliny</HI> the Younger informs
us, in his account of his uncle's journey to
Vesuvius, that his secretary sat by him, ready
to write down whatever occurred remarkable;
and that he had <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands, that
the coldness of the weather might not impede
his business.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the ninth century, the
use of <HI>Gloves</HI> was become so universal, that
ever the Church thought a regulation in that
part of dress necessary. In the reign of <HI>Lewis
le Debonnaire,</HI> the Council of Aix ordered, that
the Monks should only wear <HI>Gloves</HI> made of
sheep-skin.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="425"/>
That Time has made alterations in the form
of this, as in all other apparel, appears from the
old pictures and monuments.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to point out the various
uses of <HI>Gloves</HI> in the several ages; for, beside
their original design for a covering of the
hand, they have been employed on several
great and solemn occasions: as in the cere∣mony
of <HI>Investitures,</HI> in bestowing lands; or,
in conferring <HI>dignities.</HI> Giving possession by
the delivery of a <HI>Glove,</HI> prevailed in several
parts of Christendom in later ages. In the
year 1002, the Bishops of Paderborn and Mon∣cerco
were put into possession of their Sees by
receiving a <HI>Glove.</HI> It was thought so essential
a part of the episcopal habit, that some Ab∣bots
in France, presuming to wear <HI>Gloves,</HI> the
Council of Poitiers interposed in the affair, and
forbid them the use of them, on the same
footing with the ring and sandals, as being pe∣culiar
to Bishops.</P>
<P>Monsieur Favin observes, that the custom of
<PB N="409" REF="426"/>
blessing <HI>Gloves</HI> at the Coronation of the Kings
of France, which still subsists, is a remain of
the Eastern practice of Investiture by <HI>a Glove.</HI>
A remarkable instance of this ceremony is re∣corded
in the German History. The unfortu∣nate
<HI>Conradin</HI> was deprived of his crown and
his life by the usurper <HI>Mainfroy.</HI> When, hav∣ing
ascended the scaffold, the injured Prince
lamented his hard fate, he asserted his right to
the Crown; and, as a token of Investiture,
threw his <HI>Glove</HI> among the crowd; begging it
might be conveyed to some of his relations,
who should revenge his death. It was ta∣ken
up by a Knight, who brought it to Peter,
King of Arragon, who was afterwards crown∣ed
at Palermo.</P>
<P>As the delivery of <HI>Gloves</HI> was once a part
of the ceremony used in giving possession; so
the depriving a person of them, was a mark of
divesting him of his office, and of degrading
him. Andrew Herkley, Earl of Carlisle, was,
in the reign of Edward the Second, impeach∣ed
<PB N="410" REF="427"/>
of holding a correspondence with the Scots,
and condemned to die as a traitor. Walsing∣ham,
relating other circumstances of his de∣gradation,
says—'His spurs were cut off
with a hatchet; and his <HI>Gloves</HI> and shoes
were taken off, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>Another use of <HI>Gloves</HI> was in a duel: on
which occasion, he who threw one down, was
thereby understood to give defiance; and he
who took it up, to accept the challenge.</P>
<P>The use of single combat, at first designed
only for a trial of innocence, like the ordeal
fire and water, was, in succeeding ages, prac∣tised
for deciding right and property. Chal∣lenging
by the <HI>Glove</HI> was continued down to
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, as appears by
an account given by Spelman, of a duel ap∣pointed
to be fought in Tothill Fields, in the
year 1571. The dispute was concerning some
lands in the county of Kent. The Plaintiffs
appeared in Court, and demanded a single
combat. One of them threw down his <HI>Glove.</HI>
<PB N="411" REF="428"/>
which the other immediately took up, carried
off on the point of his sword, and the day of
fighting was appointed; but the matter was
adjusted in an amicable manner by the Queen's
judicious interference.</P>
<P>Though such combats are now no longer in
use, we have one ceremony still remaining
among us, in which the challenge is given by
a <HI>Glove</HI>; viz. at the Coronation of the Kings
of England: upon which occasion, his Ma∣jesty's
champion, compleatly armed, and well
mounted, enters Westminster Hall, and pro∣claims
that, if any man shall deny the Prince's
title to the crown, he is ready to maintain and
defend it by single combat. After which de∣claration,
he throws down his <HI>Glove,</HI> or gaunt∣let,
as a token of defiance.</P>
<P>This custom of challenging by the <HI>Glove</HI> is
still in use in some parts of the world. It is
common in Germany, on receiving an affront,
to send a <HI>Glove</HI> to the offending party, as a
challenge to a duel.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="429"/>
The last use of <HI>Gloves</HI> to be mentioned here
was for carrying the <HI>Hawk,</HI> which is very an∣cient.
In former times, Princes and other
great men took so much pleasure in carrying
the Hawk on their hand, that some of them
have chosen to be represented in this attitude.
There is a monument of Philip the First
of France still remaining; on which he is
represented at length, on his tomb, holding a
<HI>Glove</HI> in his hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Chambers says that, formerly, judges
were forbid to wear <HI>Gloves</HI> on the bench. No
reason is assigned for this prohibition. Our
judges lie under no such restraint; for both
they and the rest of the court make no diffi∣culty
of receiving <HI>Gloves</HI> from the sheriffs,
whenever the session or assize concludes with∣out
any one receiving sentence of death, which
is called a <HI>Maiden Assize.</HI> This custom is of
great antiquity.</P>
<P>Our curious Antiquarian has also preserved
a very singular anecdote concerning <HI>Gloves.</HI>
<PB N="413" REF="430"/>
Chambers informs us, that it is not safe at pre∣sent
to enter the stables of Princes without
pulling off the <HI>Gloves.</HI> He does not, indeed,
tell us in what the danger consists. A friend
from Germany explains the matter. He says,
it is an ancient established custom in that coun∣try,
that whoever enters the stables of a Prince,
or great man, with his <HI>Gloves</HI> on his hands,
is obliged to forfeit them, or redeem them by
a fee to the servants. The same custom is ob∣served
in some places at the death of the stag;
in which case, the <HI>Gloves,</HI> if not taken off, are
redeemed by money given to the huntsmen
and keepers. This is practised in France; and
the late King never failed of pulling off one of
his <HI>Gloves</HI> on that occasion. The reason of this
ceremony is not known.</P>
<P>We meet with the term <HI>Glove-money</HI> in our
old records; by which is meant, money given
to servants to buy <HI>Gloves.</HI> This, no doubt,
gave rise to the saying of <HI>giving a pair of</HI>
<PB N="414" REF="431"/>
<HI>Gloves,</HI> to signify making a present for some
favour or service.</P>
<P>To the honour of the <HI>Glove,</HI> it has more
than once been admitted as a term of the tenure
or holding lands. One Bortran, who came in
with William the Conqueror, held the Manor
of Farnham Royal by the service of providing
a <HI>Glove</HI> for the King's right-hand on the day
of his coronation, and supporting the same
hand that day while the King held the royal
sceptre. In the year 1177, Simon de Mertin
gave a grant of his lands in consideration of
fifteen shillings, one pair of <HI>white Gloves</HI> at
Easter, and one pound of cummin.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTIFICIAL MEMORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE present is an article that, perhaps,
may be thought by many readers apo∣cryphal.</P>
<P>When Muretus was at Rome, (says Scaliger)—by was of Parenthesis, I must observe, the
relator and the auditor were the two first scho∣lars
in Europe—there came, one day, to the
palace of the French ambassador, a Florentine
of a very ill-favoured countenance, and whose
eyes were continually declined on the ground.
<PB N="416" REF="433"/>
It was said, that he possessed, in a wonderful
degree, an Artificial Memory. To give a proof
of his powers, he begged the company, who
were numerous, to seat themselves regularly,
that he might not be disturbed; and that they
would order to be written down to the number
of <HI>fifty thousand words:</HI> assuring them, that if
they pronounced them distinctly, and if after∣wards
they were read slowly, he would repeat
every word without hesitation. This was done.
They would only have troubled him with a
few: but he insisted that they should proceed.
The Secretary of the Ambassador was employed
full <HI>two hours</HI> in writing the most singular
words the company could select; and, among
them, was a Cardinal Peleve, who gave him
Polysyllables in the best or longest manner of
our late Lexicographer. The Florentine, to the
astonishment of the audience, recited them
without the smallest omission; and this he did,
beginning sometimes at the end, and sometimes
in the middle. He said, that this Artificial
<PB N="417" REF="434"/>
Memory had caused him totally to lose his na∣tural
one.</P>
<P><HI>Jedediah Buxton's</HI> singular memory appears
to have been of a different cast: he could only
<HI>count</HI> words, &amp;c. for when he went to the
play, he is said to have enumerated the <HI>words</HI>
of Garrick, and the <HI>steps</HI> of the dancers; but
he had not, like this man, any one who could
be capable of contradicting him.</P>

<HEAD>BEARDS THE DELIGHT OF ANCIENT

<P>WHEN the Fair were accustomed to behold
their Lovers with Beards, the sight of a shaved

as much indeed as, in this effeminate
age, would a gallant whose 'hairy excrement'
should <Q><L>Stream like a meteor to the troubled air.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="435"/>To obey the injunctions of his Bishops,
Louis the Seventh of France cropped his hair,
and shaved his beard. Eleanor of Acquitaine,
his consort, found him, with this uncommon
appearance, very ridiculous, and very con∣temptible.
She revenged herself, by becoming
something more than a coquette. The King
obtained a divorce. She then married the
Count of Anjou, who shortly after ascended
the English throne. She gave him, for her
marriage dower, the rich provinces of Poitou
and Guienne; and this was the origin of those
wars which for three hundred years ravaged
France, and which cost the French nation three
millions of men. All which, probably, had
never taken place, if Louis the Seventh had
not been so rash as to crop his hair and shave
his beard, by which he became so disgustful in
the eyes of the fair Eleanor.</P>

<HEAD>WAX-WORK.</HEAD>
<P>WAX-WORK has been brought sometimes
to a wonderful perfection. We have heard of
many curious deceptions occasioned by the
imitative powers of this plastic matter. There
have been several exhibitions in London, which
have pretended to an excellence they did not
attain. It must be confessed, that a saloon, oc∣cupied
by figures that represent eminent per∣sonages,
forms a grand idea. To approach
Voltaire, Franklin, or the great Frederick,
yields to their admirers a delightful sensation.
If we contemplate with pleasure an insipid
Portrait, how much greater is the pleasure,
when, in an assemblage, they appear wanting
nothing but that language and those actions
which a fine imagination can instantaneously
bestow!</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="437"/>
There was a work of this kind which Menage
has noticed, and which must have appeared a
little miracle. In the year 1675, the Duke of
Maine received a gilt cabinet, about the size
of a moderate table. On the door was in∣scribed—<HI>The Chamber of Wit.</HI> The inside
displayed an alcove and a long gallery. In an
arm-chair was seated the figure of the Duke
himself, composed of wax, the resemblance the
most perfect imaginable. On one side stood
the Duke de la Rochefoucault, to whom he pre∣sented
a paper of verses for his examination.
Mr. De Marcillac, and Bossuet, Bishop of
Meaux, were standing near the arm-chair. In
the alcove, Madame de Thianges, and Ma∣dame
de la Fayette, sat retired, reading a book.
Boileau, the Satirist, stood at the door of the
gallery, hindering seven or eight bad Poets
from entering. Near Boileau, stood Racine,
who seemed to beckon to La Fontaine to come
forwards. All these figures were formed of
wax; and this imitation must have been at
<PB N="421" REF="438"/>
once curious for it's ingenuity, and interesting
for the personages it imitated.</P>

<P>THE ancient Anatomists must have felt a

of Herophilus, an ancient Physician, who Ter∣tullian
very justly treats as a Butcher; or, as

<HEAD>MONKS.</HEAD>
<P>' THE Monks of the present day,' says
Charpentier, who died in the year 1702,
'lead sober lives, when compared with their
predecessors. Some religious Fathers were
called <HI>The Hogs of Saint Anthony.</HI> They re∣tired
<PB N="422" REF="439"/>
from the world to make eight repasts
<HI>per diem!</HI> The order of the Chartreux was of
a different complexion. It was, in it's orginal
institution, more austere than that of La
Trappe. Amongst other regulations of their
food, it was written, that with <HI>barley bread,</HI>
<HI>water,</HI> and <HI>pulse,</HI> they were fully satisfied.
And again, they promise to preserve 'perpetual
fasting, perpetual silence, and perpetual hair-cloth.
Every Saturday night was brought to
each Father his portion of food for the week,
with which they accommodated themselves
in their own cells, widely separated from
each other. But this <HI>mortification</HI> was not long
held in esteem: their severities were mitigated,
more and more, till at length they have im∣proved
the order greatly, by admitting many
of the luxuries of life. They now eat, instead
of the dry barley bread which was brought to
them on the Saturday nights, the newest loaves,
made of the whitest flour; instead of water,
they drink the richest wines, in greater quan∣tities
<PB N="423" REF="440"/>
than heretofore they drank water. The
pulse was found rather insipid food; so they
have joined to it excellent fish: and, in fact,
there is no luxury in which these Fathers, who
were enjoined by their Founder 'perpetual
fasts,' do not indulge their appetites.<Q><L>Ah, happy Convents! bosom'd deep in vines,</L>

<P>Mr. Merry, the Author of the <HI>Della Crusca

<HEAD>ROADS.</HEAD>
<P>THE magnificence of the Romans in their
public edifices, infinitely surpassed that of the
last ages. The sole inspection of <HI>their Roads</HI>
is a most convincing proof. These <HI>Roads</HI> set
out from the column erected in the middle of
Rome, and extended themselves to the remotest
borders of this vast Empire, for the conveni∣ence
and the expedition of those Legions which
had subjugated so many nations. These <HI>Roads,</HI>
of which some still remain, were high, broad,
solid, and in several places branched out into
<PB N="425" REF="442"/>
great squares, which the subverting hand of
Time seems yet to respect. <HI>Our Roads,</HI> on the
contrary, are in a variety of places in so pitiful
a condition, that three or four days of rain fre∣quently
interrupt the intercourse of commerce,
and delay the journeys of the best equipages.</P>
<P>All this is lamentably true; we need blush at
the Romans possessing more magnificent <HI>Roads</HI>

<HEAD>LIGHT SUMMER SHOWERS FORMING BURN∣ING
MIRRORS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Summer, after some days of fine wea∣ther,
during the heat of the day, if a storm
happens, accompanied with a few light Showers
of rain; and if the Sun appears immediately
after with all it's usual ardour, it burns the
foliage, and the flowers on which the rain had
<PB N="426" REF="443"/>
fallen, and destroys the hopes of the orchard.
The burning heat, which the ardour of the Sun
produces at that time on the leaves and flowers,
is equal to the intense heat of <HI>burning Iron.</HI>
Naturalists have sought for the cause of this
strange effect, but they have said nothing
which satisfies a reasonable mind. This is,
however, the fact. In the serene days of the
Summer, it is visible that there gathers on the
foliage and the flowers as, indeed, on every
other part, a little dust, sometimes more and
sometimes less, scattered by the wind. When
the rain falls on this dust, the drops mix to∣gether,
and take an oval or round form, as we
may frequently observe in our houses, on the
dusty floor or cieling, when they scatter water
before they sweep them. It is thus these globes
of water, mingled on the foliage, form so
many of those convex glasses which we call
Burning, Mirrors, and which produce the same
effect. Should the rain be heavy and last long,
the Sun would not then produce this burning
<PB N="427" REF="444"/>
heat, because the force, and the duration of the
rain, will have destroyed the dust which form∣ed
these drops of water; and these drops, losing
their globular form, in which alone consisted
their caustic power, will be dispersed without
any extraordinary effect. For this observation,
which, to the Naturalist must appear curious
and novel, he is indebted to the ingenious
Huet, Bishop of Avranches.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>BLEEDING AND EVACUATION, TWO REME∣DIES
FOR LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>HUET has a very singular observation on
Love, which he exemplifies by an Anecdote
as singular.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> he says, is not merely a passion of
the soul, but it is also a disease of the body,
like <HI>the Fever.</HI> It is frequently in the blood,
and in the mind, which are terribly agitated;
and, to be cured, it may be treated as <HI>metho∣dically</HI>
<PB N="428" REF="445"/>
as any other disorder. Great perspira∣tions,
and copious Bleedings, that carry away
with the humour the inflammable spirits, would
purge the blood, calm the emotions, and re∣place
every part in it's natural state.</P>
<P>The great Condé, having felt a violent passion
for Mademoiselle de Vigean, was constrained to
join the army. While his absence lasted, his pas∣sion
was continually nourished by the tenderest
recollections of Love, and by an intercourse of
a continued correspondence, till the conclusion
of the campaign, when a dangerous sickness
brought him to the most imminent danger.
To the violence of his illness, violent Reme∣dies
were applied; and every thing that was
most efficacious in physic was given to the
Prince. He regained his <HI>health,</HI> but he had
lost his <HI>Love:</HI> the great Evacuations had car∣ried
away his passion; and when he thought
himself a Lover, he found he had ceased to
Love.</P>
<P>On this Anecdote it is to be observed, that
<PB N="429" REF="446"/>
the fact is well authenticated; and, however the
reader may feel himself inclined to turn Wit on
this occasion, it's veracity cannot in the least be
injured. But it must be confessed, that <HI>Evacu∣ations</HI>
may not always have on a despairing
lover the same happy effect. 'When we would
explain the mechanism of the human passions,'
observes an ingenious writer, 'the observa∣tions
must be multiplied.' This fact, then,
does not tend to shew that the same remedies
will cure every lover, but that they did cure
the Prince de Condé.</P>
<P>There is, however, another species of eva∣cuation,
not less efficacious, for a despairing
swain, which will probably amuse the reader.</P>
<P>A German gentleman burned with an amo∣rous
flame for a German Princess. She was
not insensible to a reciprocal passion; and to
have him about her person, without giving
scandal, she created him her General. They
lived some time much pleased with each other;
but the Princess became sickle, and the Gene∣ral
<PB N="430" REF="447"/>
grew jealous. He made very sharp remon∣strances;
and the Princess, who wished to be
free, gave him his <HI>congé,</HI> and he was con∣strained
to quit her. But his passion at every
hour increased: he found he could not live out
of her presence; and he ventured to enter im∣perceptibly
into her cabinet. There he threw
himself at her feet, and entreated her forgive∣ness.
The Princess frowned, and condescended
to give no other answer than a command to
withdraw from her Royal Highness's presence.
The despairing lover exclaimed, that he was
ready to obey her in every thing but that; that
he was resolved, in this, to disobey her; and
that he preferred to die by her hand. In say∣ing
this, to give force to his eloquence, he pre∣sented
his naked sword to the German Princess;
who, perhaps, being little acquainted with the
flowers of rhetoric, most cruelly took him at
his word, and run him through the body.
Fortunately, the wound did not prove mortal:
<PB N="431" REF="448"/>
he was healed of his wound at the end of three
months; and likewise of his passion, which had
flowed away with the effusion of blood.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>INFECTIOUS DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>THE present article, from the learned Bishop
of Avranches, if not a valuable, forms at least
an ingenious speculation.</P>
<P>Neither Naturalists or Physicians have in∣formed
us, what is the cause which renders
contagious so many diseases, while others are
not in the least infectious. The gout, the gra∣vel,
the epilepsy, the apoplexy, are not caught
by frequenting the company of the diseased;
but the plague, the dysentery, the itch, the
bloody-flux, occasion frequently terrible ra∣vages
by their infection. This is very proba∣bly
the fact. It may be said, in general, that
all contagious diseases produce <HI>worms,</HI> which
are contained in ulcers, pustules, or pimples,
<PB N="432" REF="449"/>
either internal or external, some less and some
more, and of different kinds. We shall not
here examine the cause of the productions of
these <HI>worms</HI>; but their effect is common and
unvaried, and sometimes visible. It is also
well known that these worms, by undergoing
a revolution, which in them is natural, change
into the fly state, and become <HI>gnats</HI>; this is
done in a short time, and in infinite numbers.
As soon as these flies, imperceptible by their
diminutive size, can lift themselves by their
wings, they take their flight. They are there
scattered abroad; and, entering the bodies of
men by respiration, they infuse that poison by
which they are engendered, and communi∣cate
that corruption from whence they have
sprung.</P>
<P>It is thus great fires have been found very
serviceable in public contagions: kindled in
divers places, they have, as many imagine,
purified the air. The air is, indeed, purified,
but not in the manner generally supposed,
<PB N="433" REF="450"/>
by rarifying and changing it's composition,
but in burning and consuming these flying
<HI>gnats</HI> with which the air is filled; and which,
attracted by the light of the flames, mix with
them, and are destroyed in the same manner
as moths are by a candle. An opposite cause
produces also the same effect; I mean, a sharp
frost, that kills and destroys these terrible in∣sects,
if not entirely, at least, the greater
part: for it has been known, that so great have
been their numbers, that many have escaped
the rigours of the frost, and have continued the
infection; as it happened some centuries back,
in the dreadful Plague, which desolated Den∣mark,
and the neighbouring countries.</P>

we must not be astonished. Saint Bernard had
promised those who assisted to found it, as
much "<HI>Spatium,</HI>" or place in Heaven, as
they gave <HI>land</HI> to his Order of Citeaux. The
good people of those days had more faith in
Saints than their graceless posterity; and, had
the Magistrates not restrained their pious zeal,
this Abbey would have occupied a whole pro∣vince.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="455"/>
So also, when Pope Urban had to combat
with Clement the Seventh, he was obliged to
have recourse to the scheme of Saint Bernard.
This is not wonderful: but it is wonderful,
that, as soon as he published a Bull, promising
a plenary remission of their <HI>Sins,</HI> and a place
in <HI>Paradise,</HI> to all who fought in his cause,
or contributed money to support it, our own
nation flew up in arms; and, as an old Histo∣rian
observes—'As soon as these Bulls were
published in England, the whole people were
transported with joy, and thought that the
opportunity of obtaining such inestimable
graces was not to be neglected.' The repre∣sentative
of Saint Peter can no more issue such
roaring <HI>Bulls: tempora mutantur!</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHINESE PHYSICIANS.</HEAD>

the slowness, the increase, or quickness,
of the pulse, can judge of the cause, the nature,
the danger, and the duration, of his disorder.
Without their patient's speaking, they reveal
infallibly what part is affected. They are at
once Doctors and Apothecaries, composing the
remedies they prescribe. They are paid when
they have compleated a cure; but they receive
nothing when their remedies do not take effect.
Our Physicians, it must be confessed, are by no
means so skilful as the Chinese: but, in one
thing, they have the advantage over them;
which is, in taking their fees before they have
performed the cure. And it is thus that Phy∣sicians,
with little or no learning, ride in their

very learned, and walk on foot.</P>

<HEAD>FEMALE BEAUTY, AND ORNAMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ladies in Japan gild their teeth; and
those of the Indies paint them red. The blackest
<PB N="438" REF="457"/>
teeth are esteemed the most beautiful in Gu∣zurat,
and in some parts of America. In
Greenland, the women colour their faces with
blue and yellow. However fresh the com∣plexion
of a Muscovite may be, she would
think herself very ugly if she was not plaistered
over with paint. The Chinese must have
their feet as diminutive as those of the she∣goats;
and, to render them thus, their youth
is passed in tortures. In Ancient Persia, and
aquiline nose was often thought worthy of the
crown; and, if there was any competition be∣tween
two Princes, the people generally went
by this criterion of majesty. In some coun∣tries,
the mothers break the noses of their
children; and, in others, press the head be∣tween
two boards, that it may become square.
The modern Persians have a strong aversion
to red hair: the Turks, on the contrary, are
warm admirers of these disgusting locks. The
Indian Beauty is thickly smeared with bear's
fat; and the female Hottentot receives from
<PB N="439" REF="458"/>
the hand of her lover, not silks, or wreaths of
flowers, but warm guts and reeking tripe, to
dress herself with enviable ornaments.</P>
<P>At China, small eyes are liked; and the
girls are continually plucking their eye-brows,
that they may be small and long. The Turkish
women dip a gold brush in the tincture of a
black drug, which they pass over their eye-brows.
It is too visible by day, but looks
shining by night. They tinge their nails with
a rose-colour.</P>
<P>An ornament for the nose appears to us
perfectly unnecessary. The Peruvians, how∣ever,
think otherwise; and they hand on it a
weighty ring, the thickness of which is pro∣portioned
by the rank of their husbands. The
custom of boring it, as our Ladies do their ears,
is very common in several nations. Through
the perforation are hung various materials;
such as green crystal, gold, stones, a single and
sometimes a great number of gold rings. This
is rather troublesome to them in blowing their
<PB N="440" REF="459"/>
noses; and the fact is, some have informed us,
that the Indian Ladies never perform this very
useful operation.</P>
<P>The female head-dress is carried, in some
countries, to singular extravagance. The
Chinese Fair carries on her head the figure of
a certain bird. This bird is composed of cop∣per,
or of gold, according to the quality of the
person: the wings, spread out, fall over the
front of the head-dress, and conceal the temples.
The tail, long and open, forms a beautiful tuft
of feathers. The beak covers the top of the
nose; the neck is fastened to the body of the
artificial animal by a spring, that it may the
more freely play, and tremble at the slightest
motion.</P>
<P>The extravagance of the Myantses is far more
ridiculous than the above. They carry on their
heads a slight board, rather longer than a foot,
and about six inches broad: with this they
cover their hair, and seal it with wax. They
cannot lie down, nor lean, without keeping the
<PB N="441" REF="460"/>
neck very straight; and, the country being very
woody, it is not uncommon to find them with
their head-dress entangled in the trees. When∣ever
they comb their hair, they pass an hour
by the fire in melting the wax; but this comb∣ing
is only performed once or twice a year.</P>
<P>To this curious account, extracted from Du∣halde,
we must join that of the inhabitants of
the Land of Natal. They wear caps, or bon∣nets,
from six to ten inches high, composed of
the fat of oxen. They then gradually anoint the
head with a purer grease; which, mixing with
the hair, fastens these <HI>bonnets</HI> for their lives!</P>

<HEAD>MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>NATURALISTS pretend, that animals and
birds, as well as 'Knotted oaks,' as Con∣greve
informs us, are exquisitely sensible to the
charms of Music. This may serve as an in∣stance.
An officer, having spoken somewhat
too free of the Minister Louvois, was—as once
was the custom—immediately consigned to the
Bastile. He begged the Governor to permit
him the use of his lute, to soften, by the har∣monies
of his instrument, the rigours of his
prison. At the end of a few days, this mo∣dern
Orpheus, playing on his lute, was great∣ly
astonished to see frisking out of their holes
great numbers of mice; and, descending from
their woven habitations, crouds of spiders, who
formed a circle about him, while he continued
breathing his soul-subduing instrument. His
surpize was, at first, so great, that he was
<PB N="447" REF="466"/>
petrified with astonishment; when, having
ceased to play, the assembly, who did not
come to see his person, but to hear his instru∣ment,
immediately broke up. As he had a
great dislike to spiders, it was two days be∣fore
he ventured again to touch his instru∣ment.
At length, having conquered, for the
novelty of his company, his dislike of them, he
recommenced his concert; when the assembly
was by far more numerous than at first;
and, in the course of farther time, he found
himself surrounded by a hundred <HI>musical ama∣teurs.</HI>
Having thus succeeded in attracting this
company, he treacherously contrived to get rid
of them at his will. For this purpose, he
begged the keeper to give him a cat, which he
put in a cage, and let loose at the very instant
when the little hairy people were most entranced
by the Orphean skill be displayed.</P>

<HEAD>LOCUSTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Locusts, so frequently mentioned in
the Scriptures, and in many ancient Authors,
are a species of Grashoppers that have nothing
in them disgustful. The Parthians, the Ethio∣pians,
and the Arabs, found them delicious
food. After causing them to fall from the
trees by means of smoke, ascending from fires
kindled at their feet, they salted, dried them in
the sun, and preserved them for food through∣out
the year. Saint John the Baptist ate them
with wild honey, according to the custom of
the poor of those times. They appear some∣times
in Asia, and in Africa, in such prodigi∣ous
numbers, that they darken the air, and
consume in an instant the fruits and herbage of
a whole country; the heaps of those which die
infect the air and occasion a contagion. It is
probable, that these Phenomena are the <HI>Har∣pies</HI>
<PB N="449" REF="468"/>
of the ancients, which even came to devour
the meats on the table of the King of Bythinia;
and if we add, that Calais and Zethus, the
Children of Boreas, chased them from this
country, and pursued them to the Isles of Stro∣phades,
which are in the Ionian Sea, where
they caused them to perish, all this fiction may
be understood thus—that the Northern winds
had blown them into this Sea: and it is true,
that nothing so certainly delivers a country
which is infected with these insects, as a strong
wind that carries them off to the Sea, where
they infallibly must perish. On this head, the
Reader may consult Goldsmith.</P>

<HEAD>ANTI-MOINE, OR ANTIMONY; COFFEE; AND
JESUIT'S BARK.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin of <HI>Antimony</HI> is a remarkable
circumstance. Basil Valentin, Superior of a
College of Religionists, having observed that
<PB N="450" REF="469"/>
this mineral fattened the Pigs, imagined that
it would produce the same effect on the Holy
Brotherhood. But the case was seriously
different: the unfortunate Fathers, who gree∣dily
made use of it, died in a very short time.
This is the origin of it's name, which I have
written according to the pure French word. In
spite of this unfortunate beginning, Paracelsus
resolved to bring this mineral into practice;
he thought he could make it useful, by mixing
it with other preparations, but he did not suc∣ceed
according to his hopes. The Faculty, at
Paris, were on this occasion divided into two
parties: the one maintained, that <HI>Antimony</HI>
was a <HI>poison</HI>; the other affirmed, that it was an
excellent <HI>remedy.</HI> The dispute became more
general, and the Parliament and the Sorbonne
interfered in the matter: but some time after∣wards,
the world began to judge rightly con∣cerning
this excellent mineral; and it's won∣derful
effects have occasioned the Faculty to
place it among their best remedies.</P>
<P><PB N="451" REF="470"/>
The use of COFFEE is said to have a similar
origin; that, however, was never attended
with such dreadful effects. A Prior of a mo∣nastery
in the part of Arabia where this berry
grows, having remarked, that the Goats who
eat of it became extremely brisk and alert, re∣solved
to try the experiment on his Monks, of
whom he so continually complained for their
lethargic propensities. The experiment turn∣ed
out successful; and, it is said, it was owing
to this circumstance, that the use of this Ara∣bian
berry came to be so universal.</P>
<P>A casual circumstance discovered that ex∣cellent
febrifuge, the JESUIT'S BARK. An
Indian, in a delirious fever, having been left
by his companions by the side of a river, as in∣curable,
to quench his burning thirst, he na∣turally
drank copious draughts of the water,
which, having long imbibed the virtues of the
bark, which abundantly floated on the stream,
it quickly dispersed the fever of the Indian.
He returned to his friends; and, having ex∣plained
<PB N="452" REF="471"/>
the nature of his remedy, the indis∣posed
crouded about the margin of the holy
stream, as they imagined it to be, till they per∣fectly
exhausted all it's virtues. The Sages of
the tribe, however, found at length in what
consisted the efficacy of the stream. The Ame∣ricans
discovered it, in the year 1640, to the
lady of the Vice-roy of Peru, who recovered
by it's use from a dangerous fever. In 1649,
the reputation of this remedy was spread about
Spain, Italy, and Rome, by the Cardinal de
Lugo and other Jesuits. And thus, like the
Antimony, it's name is significant of it's
origin.</P>

<HEAD>SOLOMON AND SHEBA.</HEAD>
<P>I RECOLLECT a pretty Story, which, in
the Talmud of Gemara, some Rabbin has at∣tributed
to Solomon.</P>
<P>The power of this Monarch had spread his
wisdom to the remotest parts of the known
world. A private Scholar in general, passes
his life in obscurity; and Posterity—a solitary
consolation—spreads his name to the most dis∣tant
regions. But when a King is a Student,
the case is reversed. Queen Sheba, attracted
by the splendour of his reputation, or, more
<PB N="454" REF="473"/>
probably, urged by the insatiable curiosity of
the female, visited this poetical King at his
own court, with the sole intention of <HI>asking
him questions.</HI> The Rabbin cannot inform me,
if her examination of the Monarch was al∣ways
made in the chamber of audience; there
is reason to suspect that they frequently retired,
for the solution of many a hard problem, to the
philosophic solitude of a private cabinet. But
I do not intend by any means to make this
work (as my Lord Lyttleton answered to a
curious female concerning his History) 'a
vehicle for antiquated scandal.'</P>
<P>It is sufficient, that the incident I now re∣late
passed as Solomon sat surrounded by his
court. At the foot of the throne stood the
inquisitive Sheba; in each hand, she held a
wreath of flowers; the one, composed of na∣tural,
the other, of artificial flowers. Art, in
the labour of the mimic wreath, had exqui∣sitely
emulated the lively hues, and the varie∣gated
beauties of Nature; so that, at the dis∣tance
<PB N="455" REF="474"/>
it was held by the Queen for the inspec∣tion
of the King, it was deemed impossible
for him to decide—as her question imported—which wreath was the natural, and which the
artificial. The sagacious Solomon seemed
posed; yet, to be vanquished, though in a trifle
by a trifling woman, irritated his pride. The
son of David—he who had written treatises
on the vegetable productions 'from the ce∣dar
to the hyssop,' to acknowledge himself
outwitted by a woman, with shreds of papers
and glazed paintings! The honour of the
Monarch's reputation for divine sagacity
seemed diminished; and the whole Jewish
court looked solemn and melancholy. At length,
an expedient presented itself to the King; and,
it must be confessed, worthy of the Natural
Philosopher. Observing a cluster of Bees
hovering about a window, he commanded that
it should be opened: it was opened; the
Bees rushed into Court, and alighted im∣mediately
on one of the wreaths, while not a
<PB N="456" REF="475"/>
single one fixed on the other. The decision
was not then difficult; the learned Rabbins
shook their beards in rapture, and the baffled
Sheba had one more reason to be astonished at
the wisdom of Solomon.</P>
<P>This would make a pretty poetical Tale. It
would yield an elegant description, and a pleas∣ing
moral; that <HI>the Bee</HI> only <HI>rests</HI> on the na∣tural
beauties, and never <HI>fixes</HI> on the <HI>painted
flowers,</HI> however inimitable the colours may be
laid on. This, applied to the <HI>Ladies,</HI> would

a bell rung; which was usual when

twinkling of the Poet's eye, he beheld himself
deserted by all his auditors, except one person;
who, being very deaf, had not heard the bell.

possessed a correct taste, and for this reason
remained there to hear the last verse of his

and the answer of Pantagruel to Panurge con∣cerning
his intention of marrying, Menage
observes, is copied from a Latin Sermon on
Widowhood, by a Monk of Cluny. The ori∣ginal
passage has sufficient humour to induce
me to transcribe it—</P>
<P>A certain widow, who felt a very strong in∣clination
towards the holy bond of matrimony,
thought it most decent to take the advice of
the Curate of her parish, who passed for what
is called <HI>a very good-natured soul,</HI> because he
<PB N="459" REF="478"/>
was disposed to let every one act as they
thought proper. 'I am,' said she, 'a poor
unhappy woman, who has lost the best husband
in the world. My apprentice knows all the
ways of his old master. I have often thought
I should do well to marry this young man;
but I wish to take your advice.' The Curate
immediately answered, that she had then better
take him. 'Ah! but I have my fears,' re∣joined
the widow: 'when a servant becomes
a master, it is dangerous.' The Curate ap∣proved
of this sentiment, and advised her not
to marry him. 'But what shall I do?' ex∣claimed
the widow: 'I cannot proceed in the
business my late husband left, unless I find
another.'—'True,' the Curate replied; 'you
will then do well to marry him.'—'Very well,'
she answered: 'but, if he happens to turn out
bad, he may ruin me!'—'Very just,' replied
the Curate; 'you must not marry him then.'
It was in vain: the good-natured Ecclesiastic,
to get rid of her importunities, always agreed
<PB N="460" REF="479"/>
with her sentiments. He observed her incli∣nations
for the apprentice; and, at length, he
found this expedient to terminate her objec∣tions.
'Go, Madam, and take advice of the
Bells of the Steeple: when they ring, they
will tell you what you should do.' When the
bells rung, the widow attentively listened; and,
according to her wishes, she heard distinctly,
'<HI>Prens ton valet, prens ton valet!</HI>' Upon
these strong arguments, in favour of the young
man, she married him. Scarce had the honey∣moon
closed, when she received very cruel
treatment from her late apprentice; and she
who was mistress, now became a servant. She
went to complain to the good-natured Curate
of the advice he gave her; cursing the apocry∣phal
Bells of the Church, and her fond cre∣dulity.
He told her, that she had misunder∣stood
the Bells—'Observe them next time.'
The widow again listened; and very clearly
distinguished the sounds of '<HI>Ne le prens pas,
ne le prens pas!</HI>' For the blows and the cruel
<PB N="461" REF="480"/>
treatment which she had received had dissi∣pated
her passion; and the truth is, that all
the advice of the Bells consisted in her own
inclinations. Agreeably to our old English
couplet—<Q><L>As the Fool thinketh,</L>
<L>So the Bell tinketh.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>THE THREE RACANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE present anecdote, to it's merit as an hu∣morous
deception, may add that of being a fact.</P>
<P>When Mademoiselle De Gournay arrived at
Paris, she desired to see the Marquis of Racan,
an eminent wit and poet. Two of Racan's
friends knew the time they had appointed for
his waiting on her; and they resolved to be
revenged on Racan for many a ridiculous situ∣ation
to which he had exposed them. One of
these gentlemen, about two hours before the
time appointed, waited on Mademoiselle De
Gournay, and announced himself as Racan.
He endeavoured to talk with the lady about
<PB N="462" REF="481"/>
her own works, which he had purposely turned
over the night before; and, though he did not
perfectly satisfy Mademoiselle De Gournay in
point of his abilities, besides committing some
gross blunders, she could not, however, but
think the Marquis was a very polite gentle∣man.
He had scarce parted from her, when
another Marquis De Racan was announced.
She naturally supposed that it was the first,
who had forgotten to say something to her,
and returned for this purpose; when, to her
great surprize, another stranger entered. She
could not help questioning him repeatedly if
he was the real Marquis De Racan; and in∣formed
him of what had just passed. The pre∣tended
Racan appeared very much hurt; and
declared, that he would be revenged of the
insult the stranger had mutually offered them.
But, to cut the matter short, Mademoiselle De
Gournay softened the choleric man; and was
infinitely pleased with the second Marquis De
Racan, who exceeded the first in every respect.
<PB N="463" REF="482"/>
Scarce had this second counterfeit Racan issued,
when the <HI>real Racan</HI> was announced! This
began to exercise the patience of Mademoiselle
De Gournay. 'What, more Racans in one
morning!' she exclaimed. However, she re∣solved
to see the third. As soon as he entered,
she raised her voice, and asked him if he meant
to insult her? Racan, who, at the best, was but
an indifferent speaker, remained silent with
astonishment. He muttered something; and
Mademoiselle de Gournay, who was naturally
violent and irascible, imagined that he was sent
to impose upon her. She pulled off her slip∣per,
and fell upon the real and unfortunate
Racan with the rage of an irritated virago, and
made him gladly retreat from a visit where he
had expected to meet with a very different re∣ception.</P>

exclamations: such as <HI>fors, buts, ifs, yets,
ohs! ahs! you'll please to observe, &amp;c.</HI> Never
did a Preacher appear with more grace and
animation. He expanded his lungs, he made
pathetic exclamations, and waved his hand in
<PB N="465" REF="484"/>
a thousand graceful manners. The pulpit
shook; and the vault of the church, which was
vast, re-echoed to all the vociferations he sent
forth. The audience preserved a profound
silence: every one inclined his ear, and re∣doubled
his attention to catch sentences which
were never spoken. Those who sat near the
pulpit, said—'We are too near; we cannot
hear a sentence!' Those who sat remote, com∣plained
of the distance, which caused them to
lose the most wonderful sermon they ever
heard. In a word, our Preacher kept his audi∣tors
in this manner for three quarters of an
hour, all of them complaining of their seats.
When he withdrew, their acclamations fol∣lowed
him; and they resolved, the next time
he preached, to chuse their places with more
care, and not to deprive themselves of the fruits
of a sermon which they were sensible was never
equalled.</P>
<P>This anecdote will shew, that a Preacher
may succeed without reason or imagination;
<PB N="466" REF="485"/>
and, if we judge by some who enjoy a good
reputation, it will tend to prove that a musical
voice, balancing the hands, and uttering warm
exclamations, are the chief requisites for a

<HEAD>THE VENETIAN HORSEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>A HORSE in Venice, or a tree in Scotland,
I think Johnson observed, were singularities.
A Venetian, who was more accustomed to a
Gondola than to a Horse, being for the first
time mounted; and, as it not infrequently
happens to young riders, having the misfor∣tune
to be furnished with one that was restiff,
could not possibly make his nag advance a

out his handkerchief; and, holding it in the

<HEAD>THE PORRIDGE-POT OF THE CORDELIERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few at Paris who know why
they speak so much concerning the great Por∣ridge-Pot
of the Cordeliers of the great Con∣vent.
It is, in fact, a singular piece: it can
contain from five to six hundred pounds of
meat, and near two tuns of water; so that it is
no trifling occupation with those good Fathers
to make a soup. This deep Pot, broad and
high in proportion to it's depth, does not admit
of any thing being put in or drawn out with∣out
ascending a ladder. A gluttonous Cor∣delier
always took the opportunity, when the
cooks were gone to church, to repair there, and
steal some delicious bit from this enormous
Pot. He drew it up with an iron fork, and
conveyed it to his cell, to regale himself, with
two or three others of his comrades who had
the secret of conveying wine from the cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="487"/>
This Monk having one day mounted the
ladder, to draw, as usual, some delicate morsel
from the Pot, which then happened to be not
more than two-thirds full, he was obliged to
stretch himself to an unusual degree; and
the fork, by the ponderous weight of the piece
he had greedily stuck it into, slipped from his
hands. He did his best to extricate it; but,
overturned by his own weight and eagerness,
he tumbled into the Pot, and was soon suffo∣cated,
without any power of assistance, in the
boiling lake of broth. A few hours after∣wards,
the cooks came to serve the refectory.
All the broth was emptied, the basons were
filled, and brought to their usual places for the
use of the religionists. They then returned, to
bring the meat from the Pot; but how great
was their surprize, when, on ascending the
ladder, the first piece that presented itself was
the unfortunate Cordelier, quite entire! With
great labour they hauled him out. The Prior,
who was privately informed of this singular
<PB N="469" REF="488"/>
incident, thought proper to have him conveyed
to his bed. They then gave out that he died
suddenly: the world for some time believed it;
but the cooks could not keep the secret:</P>

<HEAD>FRENCH AND SPANIARDS.</HEAD>
<P>A LITTLE work, published after that fa∣mous
intermarriage which overcame the enmity
of the two Courts of France and Spain, though
it could not that of the two nations, presents
us with a humorous contrast of their manners,
dispositions, habits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>' A Frenchman,' says our Author, 'enter∣ing
his friend's house, will immediately ask
for some refreshment: a Spaniard would rather
perish with hunger or thirst. A Frenchman
salutes a lady by kissing her: a Spaniard, on
presenting a lady his hand, will cover it with
his cloak, and retreat back several paces to bow
to her at a hundred steps distant.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="491"/>
' I have often been tempted,' says the Au∣thor,
who was a Spaniard, 'to ask the mid∣wives
if it was possible that a French child
could be brought into the world in the same
manner as a Spanish infant—so dissimilar they
prove from their birth!</P>
<P>' The French have a lively apprehension,
hating idleness, and reducing their knowledge
into practical use; but they do not penetrate
deeply into any matter. The Spaniard, on the
contrary, is fond of abstract and abstruse spe∣culation,
and dwells continually on an object.
The French are afraid of believing too much;
the other, of believing too little. The former
will dispatch the weightiest business in the midst
of noise and tumult, amidst the levity of as∣semblies,
or gaieties of the table; whilst the
grave Spaniard cannot bear the buzzing of a
fly to disturb his fixed attention. In love, the
one are light and talkative; the other, constant
and secret. The Spaniard will disguise his po∣verty
under a thousand pretences, and invent
<PB N="473" REF="492"/>
as many fictions to persuade you his appearance
is owing to the necessity of concealing his per∣son;
whilst the Frenchman will press his wants
upon you with the most persevering impor∣tunity.
In every minutia, this difference
is traced; both at the toilette and table:
in mixing wine, the Spaniard puts the water
first in the glass; whilst the Frenchman puts
the wine first. A troop of Frenchmen will
walk abreast in the street with abundance of
tattle; whilst the Spaniards will walk with
measured gravity, in a defile, like a pro∣cession.
A Frenchman, discovering a person
at a distance, beckons with an uplifted hand,
drawn towards his face: the Spaniard bends
his hands downwards, and moves it towards
his feet.'</P>
<P>This contrast of humours and manners he
seems inclined to attribute to the difference of
climate: in the one country, settled and con∣stant;
in the other, ever varying, as the ge∣nius

<HEAD>ANIMALS IMITATE LANGUAGE AND
ACTION.</HEAD>
<P>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE, in his Memoirs,
relates a story concerning an old Parrot, be∣longing
to the Prince Maurice, that readily
answered to several questions promiscuously
put to it. However singular the fact may ap∣pear,
he assures us it was told him as such by
the Prince himself.</P>
<P>Scaliger tells us, that he saw a Crow, in the
French King's court, that was taught to fly at
Partridges, or any other fowl, from the fal∣coner's
hand.</P>
<P>Cardinal Assanio had a Parrot that was
taught to repeat the Apostles Creed, verbatim,
in Latin; and in the court of Spain there was
one that could sing the Gamut perfectly.</P>
<P>In the Roman History an anecdote is re∣corded,
the truth of which we have no reason
<PB N="475" REF="494"/>
to doubt. When the sovereignty of the world
was depending between Caesar and Antony, a
poor man at Rome bred up two Crows; and
taught them to pronounce, in their prattling
language, a salutation to the Emperor: and,
that he might be provided against all events,
one of them saluted Caesar, and the other An∣tony.
When Augustus was returning as the
conqueror, this man, with the Crow on his
hand, met him; and it was an ingenious and
agreeable flattery, to which Augustus was not
insensible, to be saluted by a Crow with the
acclamations of victory. He rewarded the
novel adulator munificently. The neighbour
of the man, however, having in vain essayed
to teach the same language to two Crows he
had destined for this purpose, stung with
envy at his happier fate, revealed to Augustus
that this man had another Crow at his house,
which he had intended to have saluted Antony,
had Fortune favoured his party. This mali∣cious
<PB N="476" REF="495"/>
intelligence intercepted the bounty of
Augustus.</P>
<P>Perhaps, nothing appears more wonderful
than the sight of an unwieldy Elephant danc∣ing.
The manner of teaching this grave ani∣mal
so ludicrous an action is thus cruelly prac∣tised—They bring a <HI>young Elephant</HI> upon an iron
floor heated underneath; and play on a musical
instrument, while he lifts up his legs, and shifts
his feet about, by reason of the torture of the
heat. This, frequently repeated, occasions him
to dance at the least sound of music.</P>
<P>But let us not suppose, that animals that
thus imitate the actions and language of Ra∣tional
Creatures, possess, therefore, in some de∣gree,
rationality and mental intelligence: for
when an Elephant, for instance, dances to
music, it is not from any principles of reason,
but from the concatenation of the two ideas of
<HI>heat</HI> and <HI>music,</HI> to which custom has habituated
him. So a Parrot may answer any question it
is accustomed to hear; but this action needs
<PB N="477" REF="496"/>
not the aid of reason, since it may be effected
by <HI>an habitual idea</HI> of things. Even the in∣ferior
ranks of animals receive their <HI>ideas</HI> by
the <HI>senses.</HI> Such and such sounds often re∣peated,
and such and such actions immediately
preceding or immediately following those
sounds, must necessarily form a <HI>complex idea</HI>
both of the sound and action; so that, when
either such action or such sound is repeated, an
idea of the other must necessarily attend it.
Thus Dogs are taught to fetch and carry; and
Parrots speak more words than one together.
These words, <HI>Poor Poll!</HI> for instance, being
often repeated together, if one be mentioned,
and the other left, there must necessarily be an
idea of the other sound, because custom and
habit link them together. As two words are
taught, so may three; and, if three, why not
many? It is thus, by a <HI>complex idea,</HI> the Ele∣phant
dances; for, when he hears music, the
idea of the heated floor occasions him to
dance.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="497"/>
The arguments here alledged for the power
which some animals shew in imitating our
speech and actions, are chiefly drawn from an
old Athenian Mercury.</P>

<HEAD>NOAH AND SATURN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE can be no doubt that <HI>Noah</HI> was the
Pagan <HI>Saturn.</HI> Noah was a just man in his
days: he endeavoured to enlighten the wicked
race amongst whom he lived by his counsels,
and to instruct them by his example. Thus,
according to Aurelius Victor, and Diodorus,
Saturn softened the wicked inclinations of
men, and endeavoured to bring them back to
their ancient purity of manners, by a civilized
and regulated life.</P>
<P>Between the Deluge and the birth of Phaleg
there was an interval of one hundred years;
when, the world not being yet shared out,
Noah had a natural right to be the Sovereign
of his children. This is the Golden Age the
Poets so much celebrate, where every thing
was in common.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="503"/>
Moses calls Noah, <HI>Isch—hadama—</HI> that is, the
Man of the Earth—for Labourer.</P>
<P>The Mythologists, who accommodated
their Fables to History, observing that the
Hebrew word bore two significations, either
<HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Husband,</HI> say, that <HI>Rhea,</HI> or the Earth,
was the wife of Saturn; and, as the Man of
the Earth also relates to Agriculture, they at∣tribute
to Saturn the art of cultivating fields,
vines, and meadows, representing him with a
scythe in his hands.</P>
<P>From the passage in Genesis, where it is said
Noah was intoxicated with the liquor of the
vines he had planted, they have said also that
Saturn presided over Ebriety. Hence they
called that day in the year in which the ma∣sters
attended their slaves, <HI>The Saturnalian
Feast.</HI></P>
<P>Plato says, in his Timaeus, that Saturn, Rhea,
and their family, were born of the Ocean and
Thetis; which corresponds with Noah and his
family coming from the waters of the Deluge.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="504"/>
Saturn had, for successors, his three children,
Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto; and Noah shared
out the earth to his three sons, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth. This last, who is Neptune, had for his
portion all the isles and peninsulas of the sea.</P>
<P>Moses says, that God consecrated to him∣self
a church in the family of Shem and, as he
must have been the greatest enemy of the Ido∣laters,
it is very probable that, hating him,
they made him Pluto, who is the god of Hell
and the Dead.</P>
<P>Cham, or Ham, had for his portion Africa,
Arabia, and Egypt; which, after his name,
was anciently called Chemie, where he was
adored, during many ages, under the name of
Jupiter Ham, Hammon, &amp;c. And why the
Pagans said of Jupiter, that he <HI>cut</HI> those parts
of his father Saturn which it is not allowed to
name, comes from this passage of the ninth
chapter of Genesis being misunderstood—<HI>Quod
cum videret Cham pater Canaan, verenda patris
sui esse nudata, nunnavit.</HI> This last word is, in
<PB N="486" REF="505"/>

<P>IF we seek for the origin of the opinion of
the Metempsichosis, or the Transmigration of
Souls into other bodies, we must plunge into
the remotest antiquity; and even then we shall
find it impossible to fix the epoch of it's first
author. We know that the notion was long
extant in Greece before the time of Pythagoras.
Herodotus assures us, that the Egyptian Priests
taught it; but he does not inform us about the
time it began to be spread. It is very pro∣bable
it followed the opinion of the Immor∣tality
of the Soul. As soon as the first Philo∣sophers
<PB N="487" REF="506"/>
had established this dogma, they
thought they could not maintain this immor∣tality
without a transmigration of souls. The
opinion of the Metempsichosis spread in al∣most
every region of the earth; and it con∣tinues,
even to the present time, in all it's
force amongst those nations who have not yet
embraced Christianity. The people of Ar∣racan,
Pegu, Siam, Camboya, Tonquin, Co∣chin-china,
Japan, Java, and Ceylon, are
still in that error, which also forms the chief

<HEAD>THE LATIN TONGUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fate of the Latin Tongue may be di∣vided
into six Ages. The Barbarous and Un∣cultivated
Age; the Middle Age; the Golden,
the Silver, the Brass, and the Iron Ages.</P>
<P>The Barbarous Age lasted from four to five
hundred years; from Romulus, in whose reign
<PB N="489" REF="508"/>
more Greek than Latin was spoken, till Li∣vius
Andronicus, the first who caused Plays to
be acted at Rome.</P>
<P>The Middle Age extends itself from An∣dronicus
till the days of Cicero. During this
interval of time, many Authors began to write
the Latin Language. The most distinguished
are, Ennius, Naevius, Plautus, Terence, and
Lucretius. The Poem of the last writer does
so much honour to this Age, that we must
candidly acknowledge, it would not be unwor∣thy,
even of the Golden Age of pure Latinity,
were it somewhat less obscure.</P>
<P>The Golden Age of the Latin Language be∣gan
in the reign of Circero, and finished
with the reign of Augustus; so that, without a
metaphor, it is but an Age. Then flourish∣ed
Varro, Cicero, Julius Caesar, Cornelius
Nepos, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Severus Albi∣novanus,
Sallust, and others; a part of whose
works have happily escaped the ravages of
Time.</P>
<P><PB N="490" REF="509"/>
The Silver Age, which commences at the
death of Augustus, and terminates with An∣tonine
the Pious, was very fruitful in excel∣lent
compositions; but it's Language began to
lose somewhat of it's richness and it's purity,
in spite of the indefatigable Quintilian, who
vainly attempted to revive the Golden Age.
Seneca, whose style is one continued affecta∣tion,
who is for ever on the stretch to catch
points, antithesis, and other trivial sports of
the mind, enervates manly sentiment, and
shocks a correct taste. It was him who cor∣rupted
the Latin Language.</P>
<P>The Age of Brass commences from the reign
of Antonine, and reaches till Honorius, under
whose reign the invasions of the Barbarians
took place. Besides profane Authors, who
abound in this Age, it produced Tertullian,
Arnobius, Lactantius, Cyprian, Saint Hilary,
Prudentius, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustin, Da∣mases,
and Sulpicius Severus.</P>
<P>The irruptions of the Barbarians occasion∣ed
<PB N="491" REF="510"/>
an Age of Iron to the Latin Language. Who
has not heard declamations against the Goths
and Vandals? This dreadful epoch lasted from
six to seven Ages. During this time, some
Authors, however, arose, who have done
honour to the Latin Tongue; but it must be
recollected, that the ignorance of these times
was so deplorable, that our great Alfred com∣plains,
that in England it was difficult to find
a Priest who could read; and the Historian of
Universal History must record, that the know∣ledge
of the Ecclesiastics consisted only in
some very barbarous Latin.</P>
<P>Aldensis Manutius composed the first Latin
Grammar. It was printed at Paris in 1500.
The <HI>Method of the Port Royal</HI> is the first which
freed itself from the bondage of prescribing
rules in Latin, to learn the Latin Language.</P>
<P>The Latin Language is ranked amongst those
they call <HI>dead,</HI> because they are no more the
Languages the vulgar of any nation speak;
and, being regulated by the ancient Authors,
<PB N="492" REF="511"/>
custom can no more tyrannize over them.

than to detract any thing from the worth
thereof, since out of every Language we have
culled the most significant words, and equally
participate in that which is excellent in them:
their imperfections being rejected; for it is
neither so boisterous as <HI>the Dutch,</HI> nor so ef∣feminate
as <HI>the French,</HI> yet as significant as <HI>the
Latin</HI>; and, in the happy conjunction of two
words into one, little inferior of <HI>the Greek.</HI>'</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan thus ingeniously has written
on the same topic—'Upon a fair comparison,
it will appear that <HI>the French</HI> have emasculated
their Tongue, by rejecting such numbers of
their consonants; and made it resemble one of
their painted <HI>Courtezans,</HI> adorned with frip∣peries
and fallals. That <HI>the German,</HI> by a∣bounding
too much in harsh Consonants and
Gutturals, has great size and strength, like the
statue of <HI>Hercules Farnese,</HI> but no grace. That
<HI>the Roman,</HI> like the bust of <HI>Antinous,</HI> is beau∣tiful
indeed, but not manly. That <HI>the Italian</HI>
has beauty, grace, and symmetry, like the <HI>Ve∣nus</HI>
<PB N="494" REF="513"/>
of Medicis, but is feminine; and that <HI>the
English</HI> alone resembles the ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> in
uniting the three powers, of strength, beauty,
and grace, like <HI>the Apollo of Belvedere.</HI>'</P>
<P>I contemplate with great pleasure the clas∣sical
statue which is here offered to the imagi∣nation.
When I recollect the sweetness of
<HI>Addison,</HI> the strength of <HI>Johnson,</HI> and the grace
of <HI>Melmoth,</HI> I rise into enthusiasm, and exult in
the conviction that <HI>the English</HI> is the most per∣fect
of the European Languages. The em∣barrassed
periods of Hooker, Raleigh, and
Clarendon, will no more languish on the ear.
We have polished the solid marble of our
ancestors. With strength, to which we have
no pretensions, they have extracted it from
the quarry; but we are the artificers who, with
the dexterous use of the file, can smooth their
asperities, can arrange into elegance, and can
heighten into lustre. No more shall some fu∣ture
<HI>Waller</HI> sing, that he who employs the
English Language, writes his verses on <HI>sand</HI>;
<PB N="495" REF="514"/>
and that, to endure to posterity, he must carve
in the <HI>marble</HI> of Latin and Greek.</P>
<P>The Golden Age of the English Language,
however, seems approaching to it's first state.
Nothing contributes so much to corrupt it's
purity as an inundation of Frech translations,
rather than translations from the French. The
avarice of some, and the hunger of others, are
continually pouring on us whole volumes, dis∣figured
with Gallicisms; and, not infrequently,
whole sentences in French are aukwardly in∣troduced
as improvements, doubtless, to sup∣ply
the deficiences of English Language, or
rather those of the Translator.</P>
<P>Yet, it must be confessed, there are some few
<HI>French words</HI> which, with great felicity, ex∣press
a sense of which we have no exact or
parallel expressions. We may, indeed, make
use of phrases which may serve tolerably well
to explain our meaning; but the delicacy of
expression seems to be lost.</P>
<P>The ingenious Vigneul Marville has ven∣tured
<PB N="496" REF="515"/>
to censure our Language. Perhaps, he
was no competent judge of it's demerits; at
least, his criticism is too often more sprightly
than sound. But we must confess, that it is
now a century since he flourished; and, if we
reflect on the state of our Language in his day,
it will not be found totally unjust.</P>
<P>' The style of the English writers is long
and embarrassed, very difficult to translate into
Latin, into French, or into Italian. We must
recollect this when we read the works of the
English Authors in their own language with
an intention to translate them. Perhaps, the
English would bear better to be translated into
Spanish than into French, as the French is
more happily rendered into Greek than into
Latin. The Italian will find no language which,
without injuring it's delicacies and it's dimi∣nutives,
can afford a version. The German
Language is well enough adapted to the
Latin.'</P>

The reader may be pleased, probably, to
hear an ingenious Frenchman writing on our

<P>' He who loves the sciences, should not ne∣glect
the English Language. If he would be∣come
acquainted with those excellent pro∣ductions
which breathe the warmest spirit of
liberty, let him give his studies to this Lan∣guage.
Sir Richard Steele, so celebrated for
his other compositions, has given us a good
Grammar, accompanied with excellent Notes.
The Grammar of Dr. Wallis is only proper
for those who are conversant with the Latin.'</P>
<P>Perhaps, the above-mentioned Grammar
is quite forgotten. I have in my possession 'A
Grammar of the English Tongue, with Notes,
giving the Grounds and Reason of Grammer
in general,' printed for John Brightland, 1711.'
To which is prefixed, 'The Approbation of
Isaac Bickerstaff, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>' who, I suppose, is Sir
Richard Steele, dressed out in masquerade.
He says, 'that this Grammer of the English

all my female correspondents to buy, read, and
study, this Grammar, that their letters may be

<HEAD>THE DUTCH AND GERMAN LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE knowledge of these two Languages is
more useful to travellers and merchants than
to men of letters. These two Languages are
disagreeable in their words and their pronunci∣ation;
nor is their manner of expression clear.
Neither the Dutch or the Germans make use
of that easy phraseology which simply follows
the connexion of our ideas, which joins na∣turally
word with word, according to their
<PB N="499" REF="518"/>
different signification: they imitate rather the
figurative turn of the Latin, in those inver∣sions
of phrase which hold the mind in su∣spence
till the close of the sentence. They
bear so strong an affinity to each other, that it
is easy for one, who is conversant with either,
to know the other. The Dutch is hardly any
thing else than the old German. The sound
of the German Language is more full and more
agreeable than the Dutch.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THE FRENCH, THE SPA∣NISH,
AND THE ITALIAN LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is this difference between these three
Languages. The <HI>Italian</HI> owes much of it's
merit and it's softness to it's peculiar turn of
phrase, and the manner in which it employs
it's diminutives: thus it expresses, with
great felicity, the sentiments of Love. The
<HI>Spanish</HI> draws all it nobleness, and it's pomp,
from gigantic expressions and hyperboles, of
which no other Language will admit. The
<HI>French</HI> appears to hold a middle rank between
these two Languages: it can express with
strength and vivacity the Language of Reason,
by representing things as they are; it is thus
well calculated for the compositions of History,
Controversy, Theology, and Philosophy. It
seems, however, to be very unfortunate in
<PB N="501" REF="520"/>
it's Poetical productions: the French are hard∣ly
aware of it themselves; but there is no cor∣rect
ear that has been accustomed to English
versification, that can bear with any degree of
patience it's tiresome monotony. A French
Poet, who was as great an admirer of Latin
verses as of wine, compares French versifica∣tion
to the drinking of water. It's satiric
verse, however, has the preference.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian,</HI> of all the European Langua∣ges,
after the French, is the most general in
use. The facility with which it is acquired,
is one great cause of it's universality. Yet it
must be remarked, that if it is attained in some
tolerable degree with so much ease, it is, in∣deed,
diffcult to grow conversant with all it's
delicacies, or to write or speak it to perfec∣tion.
Those who wish to be informed of
the best Authors who have written in this
language, should consult the '<HI>Reggionamento
d'ella Eloquenza Italiana,</HI>' of the Abbé Fonta∣nini,
corrected and illustrated by the Notes of
<PB N="502" REF="521"/>
Apostolo Zeno, printed in two volumes, quarto,
at Venice, 1753. A work, that bears for it's
title—'The Italian Library, containing an Ac∣count
of the Lives and Works of the most
valuable Authors of Italy, by Giuseppe Baretti,'
printed for Millar, 1757—is very useful for one
who wishes to recognize the numerous Atuhors
who have written in this polite Language, at
least by their names. The criticisms are amu∣sive
and bold, in the manner of Baretti; whose
pages, it must be confessed, whatever might be
his errors as a man, or as an author, seldom
were found to weary the reader.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIVING LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Living Language in Europe
which is older than five hundred years. If we
hope for immortality, we must write in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and an infinite
number of excellent writers, have fallen mar∣tyrs
to their patriotism by writing in their mo∣ther
tongue. Spenser is not always intelli∣gible
without a glossary; and when Shake∣speare's
<HI>Rape of Lucrece</HI> was republished, a few
years after his death, his Editor thought proper
<PB N="504" REF="523"/>
to explain certain expressions which had then
become obsolete.</P>
<P>' The Living Languages,' says Menage,
'are more difficult to acquire than the Dead.'
It is now fifty years I have laboured on my
own; and I must confess I am far from hav∣ing
attained perfection. To know and to write
excellently our mother tongue, one must be
acquainted with the ancient languages, even
more than with the modern. The greater part
of languages are closely connected by one
chain. The Dissertation of Pere Besnier, a
Jesuit, on this subject, is very curious. He
formed a project for the re-union of Lan∣guages,
or the art of learning them <HI>all</HI> by
a single <HI>one.</HI> This plan may be seen in a little
Book, printed at Liege, by Nicholas le Bara∣goin,

pleasing and so useful. His abilities were ade∣quate
to the task; but, unfortunately, he had
not the leisure to apply himself.'</P>

If this plan is valuable, which it appears to
be by the account of two critical French wri∣ters,
who must be allowed able judges of this
subject; let some Student, who burns with
the ambition of rendering an important ser∣vice,
not alone to his country, but to man∣kind,
eternize his name, by devoting his life

<P>I find, in the Matanasiana, page 171, the fol∣lowing
criticism on this Language. Besides Pos∣tel,
and other Maronites of Mount Libanus, who
have worked upon the Arabic Grammar, Thomas
Erpenius has composed it's Rudiments, which
<PB N="508" REF="527"/>
appeared in 1620; and some time afterwards,
a Grammar, by Jean Maire, printed at Leyden
in 1636, to which are appended the Fables of
Lockman. The Arabic Language is intelligent
and energetic. It is full of graceful turns,
and figurative expressions, which give it great
elevation and strength. It is harmonious; and
it's good Authors increase it's natural har∣mony
by the care they take in their prosaic
compositions, to vary their periods, and to in∣troduce
a cadence which has all the melody of
verse. The book the best written in this

<HEAD>THE HEBREW.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST all those writers who have treated
<PB N="509" REF="528"/>
on the Hebrew Language, would fain per∣suade
us, that it is the first that men have
spoken: but—what is more impertinent in
them—they have the assurance to inform us
that it is the Language of God himself; nor
is this opinion by any means novel, since Saint
Gregory of Nyssa has, even in his life-time,
reprobated the idea, and calls it a folly, and a
ridiculous vanity of the Jews; as if God him∣self,
he says, had been a master of Grammar.
La Motte le Vayer writes in his Letters, that
the most partial partizans which ever the
Hebrew has had, must confess, that excepting
the inferior Languages, such as the Bask and
the Breton, &amp;c. there is not among the living
or the dead Languages, any which do not
present us with more valuable compositions
than the Hebrew does, if we except the Old
Testament. He adds, that he can well do
without making use of a barbarous jargon that
never repays us for the laceration which it oc∣casions
<PB N="510" REF="529"/>
to our throats in pronouncing it's gut∣tural
letters.</P>
<P>The Hebrew Grammars which the Chris∣tians
have composed, are infinitely more perfect
than those of the Jews. Their knowledge in
the writings of their Rabbins is not inferior;
and to this they have added a clear and regu∣lar
method, which is very necessary in a Lan∣guage
whose idioms and modes of expression
the great distance of time has so obscured,
that it is almost impossible to attain to any
perfect knowledge, or to decide with any de∣gree
of certainty concerning it.</P>
<P>Buxtorf, the father, has surpassed all those
who have devoted their studies to this Lan∣guage;
and later writers have done little more
than copying or abridging his book. It is in∣tituled—'<HI>J. Buxtorfii Thesaurus Grammaticus

<P>We may add, that the Hebrew has no other

<HEAD>OF THE SAMARITAN, CHALDAIC, SYRIAC,
ETHIOPIAN, PERSIAN, ARMENIAN, TAR∣TARIAN,

<P>THE greater part of these Languages, and
the Arabic itself, are dialects of the Hebrew;
and some so closely resemble it, that the dif∣ference
is hardly perceivable. Such are, for
instance, the Samaritan, the Chaldee, and the
Syriac. Hottinger shews, in his Chaldaic
Grammar, the affinity the Hebrew bears to
the Chaldee, the Syriac, and the Arabic. The
Jews brought the Chaldee from Babylon. The
books of Daniel and Esdras are for the greater
part written in this Language. It was the
Syriac, Jesus Christ and the Apostles spoke;
and a knowledge of this Language is very
necessary for a perfect understanding of the
New Testament.</P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="531"/>
Ludolphus has given us a Grammar of the
Ethiopian Language. This Language has a
great mixture of Hebrew, Chaldee, and Ara∣bic
words. It has a distinct and peculiar cha∣racter;
and in writing it, the vowel points are
not marked according to the custom of the
Hebrews, the Arabs, the Chaldeans, and the
Syrians; but every letter is a syllable, being
at once composed of a vowel and a conso∣nant.</P>
<P>One Louis de Dieu has given a Persian
Grammar; but Mr. Richardson has lately
published a Dictionary, which is said to be a
very valuable labour. Our nation has of late
made such a progress in this study, that we
may expect, when it shall become more uni∣versal,
to receive not only Grammars and
Dictionaries, but to partake in it's original
compositions. Sir William Jones, whose learn∣ing
is great, and whose genius is equal to his
learning, has already laid the literary world
under great obligations for some curious prose
<PB N="513" REF="532"/>
and some enchanting verse. Scaliger observes,
that the Persian Language is very beautiful,
and is expressed in few words. It bears no
analogy with the Hebrew; but, what is sur∣prizing,
it does with the German: having ma∣ny
words in common, as Father, Brother, Sis∣ter,
and other similar ones. How are we to
account for this?</P>
<P>A Tartarian Grammar has been given by
Thevenot; and, by Abbé Bignon, a Chinese.
Have we Grammars of these Languages?</P>

<HEAD>ON THE USE OF THE PAGAN MYTHOLOGY
IN POETRY.</HEAD>
<P>A REVOLUTION has taken place in modern
Poetry, which is of the greatest importance to
<PB N="514" REF="533"/>
the lovers of the art. This is no less than a
total banishment of the Heathen Mythology
from our Poetry. The great <HI>Johnson</HI> prefer∣ring,
not infrequently, a singularity of opinion
to an enforcing of truth—or, let us confess,
who has given strong marks of a deficiency in
poetical taste—has confounded the beauties of
the Pagan Mythology with it's abuse. We
are to read the criticisms of this great man
with caution; we must recollect that, in his
examination of <HI>Milton,</HI> his prejudices warp
his judgment; and, in his animadversions on
<HI>Gray,</HI> his criticisms were uncandid and unpo∣etical.
He tells us, in his Life of <HI>Prior,</HI>
'That his fictions are Mythological, and that
they are surely despicable:' for he adds—'By
the help of such easy fictions, and vulgar
topics, without acquaintance with life, and
without knowledge of art or nature, a poem
of any length, cold and lifeless like this, may
be easily written on any subject.'</P>
<P>This is dictated by the uncharitable spirit of
<PB N="515" REF="534"/>
criticism. It is strange, that a man of such
active faculties, and of such critical sagacity,
should not have perceived, that when the Poet
wanders in the unbounded regions of Fancy,
he hath little to do with the mere state of
Nature; that, expatiating in the wide range
of Imagination, he does not so much <HI>borrow</HI>
from Nature, but rather <HI>adorns</HI> her by the
creation of new beings. Hence the pipe of
the shepherd is the <HI>shrill shell of Pan</HI>; the mur∣muring
of the waters is <HI>the sigh of the Naiad</HI>;
and the dewy flowers, that sparkle on the eye,
are the <HI>glittering tears of Aurora.</HI></P>
<P>I will allow that a Pedant, well-read in his
Pantheon, may produce, what some may be
apt to take for a Poem, by a mere mechanical
effort. He may call Apollo and the Muses,
Minerva and Venus; but let him beware of
what he is about. These celestial beings are
no less dangerous than what, in our British
Solomon's time, was thought to be the raising
of the devil; of whom one said, that he doubt∣ed
<PB N="516" REF="535"/>
not, with book in hand, he could raise him
easily enough; but, when he had done that,
the danger lay in the manner he was to em∣ploy
his devilship. The Pedant may, indeed,
lug into his verse the reluctant Gods and
Godesses; but they will not have the air of
divinities. It requires the most skilful hand,
and some of the finest touches of genius, to
place them in a novel situation; to polish the
finished piece into classical beauty, and exhaust
on them the pomp and brilliancy of his ima∣gination.</P>
<P>Let us not, then, hastily resign our faith, in
the theology of ancient Poetry. If it appears
trite and insipid in the hands of a mere versi∣fier,
let us reflect, that every thing in such a
writer will have the same effect. It is cer∣tain,
that no order of beings have yet been
found so agreeable to the imagination, when
this poetic machinery is displayed by the ad∣dress
of superior genius. How admirably has
<HI>Gray,</HI> in his Progress of Poetry, embellished
<PB N="517" REF="536"/>
with these beautiful forms the third stanza of
the first Antistrophy. Allegorical Personages,
which <HI>Spenser</HI> has unfortunately employed,
soon weary. The enchantment of mytholo∣gical
fiction is continued, and is susceptible of
continual variety.</P>
<P>The omnipotence of the divinities of Poetry
is eternal: it is true, they do not always yield
their inspiration. Venus still resides in Pa∣phos;
Diana still embellishes the woods; the
Nymphs inhabit their accustomed oak; and
there is not a pure stream but, in it's crystaline
cave, is still honoured with the presence of it's
Naiad.</P>
<P>I venerate the abilities of this our late <HI>Cory∣phaeus</HI>;
but, if we are blindly to follow the
<HI>dictum</HI> of our leader, farewel to that free dis∣cussion
by which, through the medium of con∣trary
opinions, we at length attain to truth. The
critical powers of <HI>Boileau</HI> may well be opposed
to those of <HI>Johnson</HI>; and however the English
<PB N="518" REF="537"/>
dress, which Sir <HI>William Soame</HI> has given him,
may be inferior to the original <HI>Boileau,</HI> he may
yet be understood.</P>
<Q><L>IN the narration of some great design,</L>
<L>Invention, art, and fable, all must join:</L>
<L>Here <HI>fiction</HI> must employ it's utmost grace;</L>
<L>All must assume a body, mind, and face.</L>
<L>Each <HI>virtue a divinity</HI> is seen;</L>
<L><HI>Prudence is Pallas</HI>—<HI>Beauty, Paphos' Queen:</HI></L>
<L>'Tis not a cloud from whence swift lightnings fly,</L>
<L>But <HI>Jupiter</HI> that thunders from the sky.</L>
<L><HI>Echo's</HI> no more an empty, airy sound,</L>
<L>But a <HI>fair nymph,</HI> that weeps her lover drown'd.</L>
<L>Thus, in the endless treasures of his mind,</L>
<L>The Poet does a thousand figures find:</L>
<L>Around the work his ornaments he pours,</L><L>* * * * * * *</L>
<L>Without these ornaments before our eyes,</L>
<L>Th' unsinewed poem languishes and dies:</L>
<L>Your Poet in his art will always fail,</L>

<L>In vain have our mistaken Authors try'd</L>

<HEAD>ON THE POETRY OF BARON HALLER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was once the intention of the Editor to have
presented a translation of the Poetry of Baron
Haller to the public.</P>
<P>The Poet, whom I am now going to intro∣duce
to the reader, is better known in this
country for his extensive learning and recon∣dite
labours in physiology, than for those ex∣quisite
pieces which place him so conspicuously
amongst the modern Poets of Germany.</P>
<P>If England hath not bestowed on him the
honours of a Poet, France, however, hath
not been backward in this respect. His Poetry
hath been elegantly translated, and multiplied
by repeated editions. There are those who
have placed him on an equality with the cele∣brated
Gesner: and, perhaps, he is only not
equal to him in not having produced a Poem
of the magnitude of his Death of Abel.</P>
<P><PB N="523" REF="542"/>
If it is allowed me to give the character of
Haller as a Poet, I will say, that he does not
swell into that turgid eloquence, which wea∣ries
the mental eye by a cumbrous accumula∣tion
of splendour. It is the characteristic of
the German Poets, that they do not know
when to stop; the strength of their genius
transports them into obscurity: by soaring too
high, they strain the temperate eye of the
Critics; judgment to them is a silken string,
too feeble to chain the wing of an eagle.</P>
<P>I do not mean, however, to countenance or
excuse certain pieces which, they inform us,
are translations from the German; and which,
indeed, may well disgust the world with all
German Poetry. But, I believe that the bom∣bast
of these writers is rather to be attributed
to themselves, than to the unfortunate Ger∣man;
who, certainly, had he originally writ∣ten
in so aukward a style, would not have been
thought worthy of a translation.</P>
<P><PB N="524" REF="543"/>
Haller is beautiful in his descriptions, sub∣lime
in his Odes, and tender in his elegies.
He is not less to be admired as a Satirist; and
Berne once trembled at the presence of it's Ju∣venal.
His numbers are highly polished; and
it is hard to render justice to the delicate lan∣guage
of his Muse.</P>
<P>The following Poem is not partially chosen,
but for it's convenient length. There is an
elegant simplicity, added to a closeness of
thought; which, if it does not always wear
the fantastic air of novelty, impresses in the
feeling heart that philosophical consolation
worthy of the genius of Haller.</P>

<HEAD>A DESIRE TO REGAIN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY.</HEAD>

<P>Ah! woods for ever dear! delightful
groves, whose verdure shades the heights of
<PB N="525" REF="544"/>
<HI>Hasel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The neighbourhood of Berne.</NOTE> when shall I return to repose on your
bosom, where Philomel wantons on the light
branches? When shall I lay myself on the
declivity of those little hills which Nature hath
spread with green carpets of moss, where
nought is heard save the trembling leaves, agi∣tated
by the vernal airs, or the murmurs of
a little brook that refreshes those solitary
meads.</P>
<P>' O Heaven! when wilt thou permit me to
visit, once more, those vales where I passed the
spring of my life; where, often to the mur∣murs
of a falling cascade, my verse flowed in
honour of my Sylvia: while the caresses of
Zephyr, animating the grove, threw on my
pensive soul a soft melancholy. There, every
care was banished, while I sat in the umbra∣geous
depth of those woods whose boughs
were impenetrable to the beams of the sun.</P>
<P><PB N="526" REF="545"/>
' Here, continually, have I to combat with
my sorrows: my mind is oppressed with grief
for ever renewed; and I know not the sweet∣ness
of tranquillity and joy. Far from the
country where first I sprung into life: with∣out
parents, a stranger to all the world, aban∣doned
to the ardours of youth, I find myself
in possession of a dangerous liberty, without
having learnt how to conduct myself.</P>
<P>' Now disease shoots through my languish∣ing
frame, and stifles even the wish for glory,
and for science! Now my disappointed hopes
droop in the despondence of discouragement
and grief: while the sea throws itself on the
ruins of broken dykes, and brings it's waves
and death to our gates; and Mars threatens
us with the flames of war which kindle from
the ashes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inundation of the sea, and the bursting of a dyke, happen very frequently, in winter, at Amsterdam.—The Dutch were then on the eve of a war.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="527" REF="546"/>
' But let us embrace comfort. All must
terminate! The storm is weakened at each
gust it blows. Passed evils teach us to enjoy
the present good. Who is a stranger to ad∣versity,
is alike a stranger to pleasure. Time,
who, with his rapid wing, hath brought my
affliction, conducts also my felicity. I may
yet inhale the purer air of my native hills!</P>
<P>' Ah! may I soon rejoin ye, groves be∣loved!
and landscapes of spring! Ah! if Fate
should indulge me once more to partake of the
silent tranquillity of your solitude! Perhaps,
the day is not distant. The blue sky shines
when the storm is departed, and repose suc∣ceeds
to pain. Flourish, ye scenes of delight!
while I prepare to make my last voyage, in re∣turning
to your peaceful shades.'</P>

<HEAD>THE POETRY OF HALLER VERSIFIED.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lover of Polite Literature will be much
gratified by the following enchanting Versi∣fication
of the Poem of <HI>Haller,</HI> which we have
feebly attempted to reduce into <HI>Prose.</HI> The
present Versification, as spirited as it is elegant,
is the production of a very superior Poet; to
whom the Editor stands too deeply indebted,
to pass over the recollection of benefits received
from his Criticisms without being alive to the
warmest sense of gratitude. This little pro∣duction,
to use one of his own classical allu∣sions,
will be but interweaving a transient
blossom in the laurels of it's amiable Author.</P>

<L>O Heav'n! when shall once more these eyes be cast</L>
<L>On scenes where all my spring of life was pass'd;</L>
<L>Where, oft responsive to the falling rill,</L>
