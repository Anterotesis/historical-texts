<HEAD>THE
TRANSLATOR
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS not so much the Itch of being thought an Au∣thor,
nor of following, the Method of those Wri∣ters,
whether Originals, or Translators, (especially
the last) who think Prefacing so necessary; that, rather
than forego their Opinion, they will spoil a good Work for
the sake of a Half-Sheet of their own Scribbling, that in∣duces
me to attempt one in this Place: If I had had no par∣ticular
Advantage in so doing, I must, without Flattery,
inform you, that I had wav'd the Trouble: But since 'twas
necessary, pray take it and make the best on't. And now all
I have to say, is to make these Pages have a good Run;
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
which I cannot pretend to do, by any Elogy on 'em; but
refer you to the Perusal. It has indeed Two of the
Best Recommendations Book can have, at this Time; It
is like our Fashions, FRENCH. (And as the <HI>Gal∣lican</HI>
Mode, tho' never so ridiculously adjusted upon an
<HI>English</HI> Person, meets not only with Reception, but Encou∣ragement,
I'm in great Hopes the very Place of this Pam∣phlet's
Birth, will hide the Blunders of the Version.) And
then 'tis against the JESUITES. If with these
Two Qualities it should not meet Acceptation, I shall be
apt to think <HI>Diogenes,</HI> who would be bury'd with his
Face downwards, that when the World turn'd upside∣down,
(which in his Days he expected) he might lye right
in his Grave, has now got his Wish; and, by the Ill-vent
of this Commodity, judge, that all the BEAUX,
GOOD PROTESTANTS, and WELL∣MEANING
PAPISTS, (if any such there
be) are lost in the Hurricane.</P>

<HEAD>A CURIOUS
Little Oration,
Deliver'd by
Little Father ANDREW, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was one <HI>Lent,</HI> and about the
Time that Monsieur <HI>Arnaud,</HI> had
his Famous Disputes with the
JESUITES; I mean, when
JANSENISM was at the greatest
height (a Fantome which the jealous Cunning
of those good Fathers knew how to improve
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
to the Detriment and Prosecution of many
better <HI>Christians</HI>) that <HI>Little Father ANDREW,</HI>
so famous for his <HI>Witty Jokes,</HI> preach'd at
<HI>Alby.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Custom, this LITTLE
Good Man, on the <HI>Samaritan</HI>'s Day, did not
fail to make a Discourse on Grace, and what
was more, upon Efficacious Grace by it self:
And solidly proved from St. <HI>Augustin</HI>'s Princi∣ples,
That no one ever resisted that Grace; not
but that Men can, but will not; for its Attri∣bute
is just to inspire what we will not oppugn.
He added, That sufficient Grace was a New
System, broach'd by the JESUIT. <HI>Molina,</HI>
to reconcile the pretended Contradictions of
its Omnipotent Power with Freewill. In
short, he asserted <HI>Jansenism</HI> to the last De∣gree.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Society who were present
at this Sermon, being nettled to hear <HI>Molina</HI>'s
Reverend School used at this Rate, took it
(as you may well suppose) in great Dudgeon,
and resolved to load the Poor Preacher with
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
the heavy Weight of their Holy and Implaca∣ble
Fury. They extracted several Tenets,
which, in their Opinion, contain'd the most
poisonous Venom of Heresy, pack'd away to
the Archbishop of <HI>Alby</HI>; and, giving the Con∣tents
into his Hand, <HI>Is it not an Errant Shame,</HI>
(say they, with a Zeal animated not for the
Glory of God, but of the Society) <HI>Is it not a
Shame, my Lord, That this Little Whisk of a
Monk shall come hither to preach <HI>JANSENISM</HI>
Tooth and Nail; whilst the Pope, Bishops,
Kings, Magistrates, and, indeed, all Powers,
as well Ecclesiastick as Secular, are endeavouring
to root this Cockle out of the Field of the
<HI>CHURCH.</HI></HI></P>
<P>THE Archbishop, who knew by Expe∣rience
how necessary their Good-Will was, at
that Time, to the making of a Man's Fortune;
and, on the contrary, the Danger as well as
Inconveniency of being hated by them; the
Archbishop, I say, came into their Resent∣ments,
and promised them condign and spee∣dy
Satisfaction. He cited <HI>Little Father AN∣DREW,</HI>
and sharply rebuked him, for ha∣ving
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
preach'd up Heresy, not without terrible
Threats, of inflicting on him the Punishments
ordain'd in such Cases by the Canons of the
Church.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Little</HI> Priest, who was too well ac∣quainted
with the JESUITES not to know
that they were not to be offended with Impu∣nity;
and that whoever offered to contradict
their Notions, was at least a Heretick, gave a
shrewd Guess at what was coming; and there∣fore
was not mightily dismay'd at the Bishop's
thundering Reprimand; but, with a becoming
Presence of Mind, made this Answer; <HI>God
preserve me, my Lord, from Preaching Heresy
I can assure you I never had the least Intention to
deviate from the Sentiments of the <HI>Catholick
Church</HI>; some unguarded Expressions may per∣haps,
in the Heat of Discourse, have fallenn
from me; which, having met with an Evil
Construction, have given Room for the Accusa∣tion
now intended against me. Therefore, be
pleased, my Lord, to let me know what Here∣tical
Propositions I am charg'd with advancing,
that I may confront them with my <HI>SER∣MON</HI>,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>which contains no such Matters; and
if I have said any Thing that is not Orthodox,
I will retract it next <HI>Sunday</HI>; and, by my Re∣cantation,
undeceive those whom I have scanda∣liz'd
by my Imprudence.</HI></P>
<P>THE Archbishop, satisfied with this Sub∣mission
of the <HI>Little</HI> FATHER, deliver'd to him
the Paper which contain'd such of his Propo∣sitions
as were condemn'd by the JESUITES;
and gave those <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s (as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>French</HI> Burlesque Author.</NOTE><HI>Guy Patin</HI>
calls them) an Account of what had passed;
who for once were out in their Politicks,
and sung <HI>Io Paean</HI> before the Victory; loud∣ly
publishing, through the Town, the intended
Recantation of <HI>Little Father ANDREW.</HI>
They cloy'd themselves beforehand, with the
mighty Pleasure they were to receive, from
the great Shame which they pretended he
would be obliged, at that Time, to un∣dergo.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
HEAVEN knows there was no want of them
at <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Sermon; and they had taken
special Care to invite all their Partisans, and
to place themselves over against the Preacher,
that they might more fully rejoice at his
Confusion. They that knew the LITTLE
Father better, did not doubt of finding this
Sermon curiously intermix'd with Scenes of
Mirth: So that with those who were of the
<HI>Jesuitical</HI> Faction, and those who came to the
unravelling of the LITTLE Gentleman's late
Discourse, there was a very numerous Audience.</P>
<P>FATHER ANDREW got into the Pulpit
and after having cross'd himself, said, <HI>Sirs▪
before I take my Text, give me Leave to re∣count
to you a Vision I had the other Night▪
You may now, perhaps, think me a superstitiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Coxcomb, for coming hither to tell you my Dreams▪
yet when I let you know, that I hope I am in
the Number of those Servants to whom our Lord
is pleas'd to manifest his Will in a misteriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Manner: As I think my Vision Instructive; and
besides, that it will not be tiresome to you, I can
boldly beg your Attention to what follows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
THIS Exordium attracted anew the Ears of
all. <HI>Sirs,</HI> continues this Little Father, <HI>The
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Night I dreamt that I was carry'd before
the Tribunal of Jesus Christ, to be Judg'd.
T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ink with your selves what a Terror invaded
me, an unpenitent and unprepar'd Sinner. I was
horribly frighten'd, and my Fears increas'd when
the Son of God thus accosted me:</HI> Come near,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Andrew,</HI> that I may judge you. <HI>Seiz'd
at once with Fear and Respect, I threw my
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at his Feet:</HI> Hark'ye, <HI>says our Lord to me,
with an irritated Aspect,</HI> Was it not to lead
My Flock of <HI>Alby</HI> into saving Pastures, that I
gave you to that Fold; and yet, instead of
nourishing them with sound Doctrines, you
are accus'd of preaching Heresy. My God,
<HI>says I,</HI> I preach Heresy: You who <HI>search the
Reins and Heart,</HI> know perfectly I had no such
intention; and if by Ignorance or Weakness
I have had the Misfortune to advance any
Doctrines that are inconsistent with Thy Holy
Verities, I am here ready to suffer whatever
Punishment Your Divine Majesty shall please
to inflict on me. Have not you, <HI>return'd our Sa∣viour,</HI>
preach'd up such and such Tenets? (And
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
then Father <HI>Andrew</HI> cited the very Passages
condemn'd by the <HI>Jesuites.</HI>) My Dear Re∣deemer,
<HI>continued I,</HI> I confess I have, but
hitherto, I thought they were not in the
least Heretical; for I took them from a
very Great Master. What Mighty Master
is this, <HI>says our Saviour?</HI> 'Tis St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of
<HI>Aquin,</HI> that Angel of the School, which
You, of late Ages, have rais'd, to be the
Pillar of Truth, and Scourge of Heresy: And
'tis so evident that this Great Doctor has
taught what they condemn as Hetorodox in
me; that my Quotationi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Word for Word; his
Sentiments—(And then the LITTLE PRIEST
made a Repetition of what St. <HI>Thomas</HI> had
written on that Subject; <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Man is converted by his Free-Will; but His Free-Will can never effect his Conversion, if God Himself works it not in him, according to the Words of the Prophet <HI>Jeremy</HI>; <Q REND="inline"><HI>Convert me, O Lord, and I shall be converted; because Thou art my God.</HI> <BIBL>S.

<P>HO! HO! <HI>says our Lord,</HI> Let him come

that you who have been so highly honour'd
by Me; that you of whom I have render'd
so glorious a Testimony, as that you have
well written of Me: Is it possible that you
could, notwithstanding all these Favours, pre∣tend
to teach, that My will must infal∣libly
and necessarily be accomplish'd when I
am pleas'd that Man shall consent to My
Grace; not from an Absolute Necessity, but
from an Infallible Necessity, which neverthe∣less
does not obstruct Free-Will? Yes, my
Dear Saviour, <HI>reply'd Saint</HI> Thomas, I did
teach this Doctrine; I assert it: And I took
it from St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> that Devout and Famous
Doctor, who is accounted the Last of the
Fathers of Thy Holy Church: 'Tis he that
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
has taught such and such Doctrines, in such
and such Places of his Writings. (And then

For as a Man ever falls easily down a Precipice, from the Hurt of which Fall he cannot so easily recover himself: So, when he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> precipitated himself into a Profundity of Sin, he has no Power to go back; not being able to forbear Sinning, tho' his Desire may be clean conttary. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.

<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
What means all this, <HI>says Jesus Christ?</HI> Is
sweet St. <HI>Bernard a Jansenist</HI> then? Call
him. What, <HI>Bernard,</HI> with your meek and
sanctify'd Air; would one think you capable
of asserting that My Grace has an absolute
Power over Free-Will; and yet that this
same Grace does not hinder the Free-Will;
and that every Man acts infallibly as well as
freely, when I please to attract him to Me
by the Sweetness of My efficacious Inspira∣tions?
Can it be true that you have taught
all this? Yes, (my Saviour) <HI>says St.</HI> Bernard,
I'll stand to't; but St. <HI>Augustine</HI> is my Guaran∣tee;
and I ought to refer to him; because Your
Church not only approves what he has written
concerning Grace; but has, in a Manner,
canoniz'd his Opinion of it, in making use
of that Doctor's Sayings only, to exemplify
its Sentiments on that Matter. (And then the
