<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author being very sensible how particu∣lar a Tenderness is due to the FEMALE SEX, and at the same time how little they generally show to each other; declares, upon his Honour, that no one <HI>Character</HI> is drawn from the Life, in this Epistle. It would otherwise be most improperly inscribed to a <HI>Lady,</HI> who, of all the Women he knows, is the last that would be entertain'd at the Expence of Another.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CHARACTERS of WOMEN: AN EPISTLE <HI>To a LADY.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>OTHING so true as what you once let fall,</L>
<L><HI>Most Women have no Characters at all.</HI></L>
<L>Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,</L>
<L>And best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many Pictures of one Nymph we view,</L>
<L>All how unlike each other, all how true!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HI>Arcadia</HI>'s Countess, here, in ermin'd pride,</L>
<L>There, <HI>Pastorella</HI> by a Fountain side:</L>
<L>Here <HI>Fannia</HI> leering on her own good man,</L>
<L>And there a naked <HI>Leda</HI> with a Swan.</L>
<L>Let then the Fair-one beautifully cry</L>
<L>In <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s loose hair and lifted eye,</L>
<L>Or drest in smiles of sweet <HI>Cecilia</HI> shine,</L>
<L>With simp'ring Angels, Palms, and Harps divine;</L>
<L>Whether the Charmer sinner it, or saint it,</L>
<L>When Folly grows romantic, we must paint it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come then, the Colours and the ground prepare!</L>
<L>Dip in the Rainbow, trick her off in Air,</L>
<L>Chuse a firm Cloud before it falls, and in it</L>
<L>Catch, e're she change, the <HI>Cynthia</HI> of this minute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Rufa,</HI> whose eye quick-glancing o'er the <HI>Park,</HI></L>
<L>Attracts each light gay Meteor of a Spark,</L>
<L>Agrees as ill with <HI>Rufa</HI> studying <HI>Locke,</HI></L>
<L>As <HI>Flavia</HI>'s diamonds with her dirty smock,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Or <HI>Flavia</HI>'s self in glue (her rising task)</L>
<L>And issuing flagrant to an evening Mask:</L>
<L>So morning Insects that in Muck begun,</L>
<L>Shine, buzz, and fly-blow, in the setting-sun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How soft is <HI>Silia!</HI> fearful to offend,</L>
<L>The frail one's Advocate, and weak one's Friend:</L>
<L>To her, <HI>Calista</HI> prov'd her Conduct nice,</L>
<L>And good <HI>Simplicius</HI> asks of her Advice.</L>
<L>Sudden, she storms! she raves! You tip the wink,</L>
<L>But spare your censure; <HI>Silia</HI> does not drink.</L>
<L>All eyes may see from what the change arose,</L>
<L>All eyes may see—a Pimple on her nose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Papillia,</HI> wedded to her am'rous Spark,</L>
<L>Sighs for the Shades—"How charming is a <HI>Park!</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Park</HI> is purchas'd, but the Fair he sees</L>
<L>All bath'd in tears—"Oh odious, odious <HI>Trees!</HI></L>
</LG>

<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>Ladies like variegated Tulips show,</L>
<L>'Tis to their Changes half their Charms we owe;</L>
<L>Such happy Spots the nice Admirer take,</L>
<L>Fine by defect, and delicately weak.</L>
<L>'Twas thus <HI>Calypso</HI> once our hearts alarm'd,</L>
<L>Aw'd without Virtue, without Beauty charm'd;</L>
<L>Her Tongue bewitch'd as odly as her Eyes,</L>
<L>Less Wit than Mimic, more a Wit than wise:</L>
<L>Strange Graces still, and stranger Flights she had,</L>
<L>Was just not ugly, and was just not mad;</L>
<L>Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create,</L>
<L>As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Narcissa</HI>'s nature, tolerably mild,</L>
<L>To make a Wash would hardly stew a Child;</L>
<L>Has ev'n been prov'd to grant a Lover's pray'r,</L>
<L>And paid a Tradesman once to make him stare;</L>
<L>Gave alms at <HI>Easter,</HI> in a christian trim,</L>
<L>And made a Widow happy, for a whim.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Why then declare Good-nature is her scorn,</L>
<L>When 'tis by that alone she can be born?</L>
<L>Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?</L>
<L>A Fool to Pleasure, yet a Slave to Fame!</L>
<L>Now deep in <HI>Taylor</HI> and the Book of <HI>Martyrs,</HI></L>
<L>Now drinking Citron with his Grace and <HI>Ch</HI>**:</L>
<L>Now Conscience chills her, and now Passion burns,</L>
<L>And Atheism and Religion take their turns;</L>
<L>A very Heathen in the carnal part,</L>
<L>Yet still a sad, good Christian at her heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Flavia</HI>'s a Wit, has too much sense to <HI>pray,</HI></L>
<L>To <HI>toast</HI> our wants and wishes, is her way;</L>
<L>Nor asks of <HI>God</HI> but of her <HI>Stars</HI> to give</L>
<L>The mighty blessing, "while we live, to live."</L>
<L>Then all for Death, that Opiate of the Soul!</L>
<L><HI>Lucretia</HI>'s Dagger, <HI>Rosamonda</HI>'s Bowl.</L>
<L>Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?</L>
<L>A Spark too fickle, or a Spouse too kind.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Wise Wretch! of Pleasures too refin'd to please,</L>
<L>With too much Spirit to be e'er at Ease,</L>
<L>With too much Quickness ever to be taught,</L>
<L>With too much Thinking to have common Thought:</L>
<L>You purchase Pain with all that Joy can give,</L>
<L>And die of nothing but a Rage to live.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Turn then from Wits; and look on <HI>Simo</HI>'s Mate,</L>
<L>No Ass so meek, no Ass so obstinate:</L>
<L>Or her, that owns her Faults, but never mends</L>
<L>Because she's honest, and the best of Friends:</L>
<L>Or her, whose Life the Church and Scandal share,</L>
<L>For ever in a Passion, or a Pray'r:</L>
<L>Or who in sweet Vicissitude appears</L>
<L>Of Mirth and Opium, Ratafie and Tears,</L>
<L>The daily Anodyne, and nightly Draught,</L>
<L>To kill those Foes to Fair ones, Time and Thought.</L>
<L>Woman and Fool are <HI>two</HI> hard Things to hit,</L>
<L>For true No-meaning puzzles more than Wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>Pictures like these, (dear Madam) to design,</L>
<L>Asks no firm hand, and no unerring line;</L>
<L>Some wandring Touches, some reflected Light,</L>
<L>Some flying Stroke, alone can hit them right:</L>
<L>For how should equal Colours do the knack,</L>
<L><HI>Camelions</HI> who can paint in White and Black?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN publick Stations Men sometimes are shown,</L>
<L>A Woman's seen in Private life alone:</L>
<L>Our bolder Talents in full view display'd,</L>
<L>Your Virtues open fairest in the Shade.</L>
<L>Bred to disguise, in Publick 'tis you hide;</L>
<L>Where none distinguish 'twixt your <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Pride,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Weakness</HI> or <HI>Delicacy;</HI> all so nice,</L>
<L>Each is a sort of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and of <HI>Vice.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In sev'ral Men we sev'ral Passions find,</L>
<L>In Women, two almost divide the Kind,</L>
<L>Those only fix'd, they first or last obey;</L>
<L>The Love of Pleasures, and the Love of Sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>That, Nature gives; and where the Lesson taught</L>
<L>Is but to please, can Pleasure seem a fault?</L>
<L>Experience, This; by Man's Oppression curst,</L>
<L>They seek the second not to lose the first.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Men, some to Business, some to Pleasure take,</L>
<L>But every Woman is, at heart, a Rake:</L>
<L>Men, some to Quiet, some to publick Strife,</L>
<L>But every Lady would be Queen for life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet mark the fate of a whole Sex of Queens!</L>
<L>Pow'r all their end, but Beauty all the means.</L>
<L>In Youth they conquer with so wild a rage,</L>
<L>As leaves them scarce a Subject in their Age:</L>
<L>For foreign Glory, foreign Joy, they roam;</L>
<L>No thought of Peace or Happiness at home.</L>
<L>But Wisdom's Triumph is well-tim'd Retreat,</L>
<L>As hard a Science to the Fair as Great!</L>
<L>Beauties like Tyrants, old and friendless grown,</L>
<L>Yet hate Repose, and dread to be Alone,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Worn out in publick, weary ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>Nor leave one sigh behind them when they di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleasures the Sex, as Children birds, pursue,</L>
<L>Still out of reach, yet never out of view,</L>
<L>Sure, if they catch, to spoil the Toy at most,</L>
<L>To covet flying, and regret when lost:</L>
<L>At last, to Follies Youth could scarce defend</L>
<L>It grows their Age's prudence to pretend;</L>
<L>Asham'd to own they gave delight before,</L>
<L>Reduc'd to feign it, when they give no more.</L>
<L>As Hags hold <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> less for joy than spight,</L>
<L>So these their merry, miserable Night;</L>
<L>Still round and round the Ghosts of Beauty glide,</L>
<L>And haunt the Places where their Honour dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See how the World its Veterans rewards!</L>
<L>A Youth of Frolicks, an old Age of Cards,</L>
<L>Fair to no purpose, artful to no end,</L>
<L>Young without Lovers, old without a Friend,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
A Fop their Passion, but their Prize a Sot,</L>
<L>Alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah Friend! to dazzle let the Vain design,</L>
<L>To raise the Thought and touch the Heart, be thine!</L>
<L>That Charm shall grow, while what fatigues the Ring</L>
<L>Flaunts and goes down, an unregarded thing.</L>
<L>So when the Sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight,</L>
<L>All mild ascends the Moon's more sober light,</L>
<L>Serene in Virgin Modesty she shines,</L>
<L>And unobserv'd the glaring Orb declines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh blest with <HI>Temper!</HI> whose unclouded ray</L>
<L>Can make to morrow chearful as to day;</L>
<L>That pleas'd can see a younger charm, or hear</L>
<L>Sighs for a Sister with unwounded ear;</L>
<L>That ne'er shall answer till a Husband cool,</L>
<L>Or, if you rule him, never show you rule;</L>
<L>Please by receiving, by submitting sway,</L>
<L>Yet have your humour most, when you obey;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Let Fops or Fortune fly which way they will;</L>
<L>Despise all loss of Tickets or Codille;</L>
<L>Spleen, Vapors, or Small-pox, above them all,</L>
<L>And Mistress of youtself, tho' China fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet believe me, good as well as ill,</L>
<L>Woman's at best a Contradiction still.</L>
<L>Heav'n, when it strives to polish all it can</L>
<L>Its last, best work, but forms a <HI>softer Man;</HI></L>
<L>Picks from each Sex, to make the Fav'rite blest,</L>
<L>Your love of Pleasure, our desire of Rest,</L>
<L>Blends, in exception to all gen'ral rules,</L>
<L>Your Taste of Follies, with our Scorn of Fools,</L>
<L>Reserve with Frankness, Art with Truth ally'd,</L>
<L>Courage with Softness, Modesty with Pride,</L>
<L>Fix'd Principles, with Fancy ever new;</L>
<L>Shakes all together, and produces—<HI>You.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ev'n such is Woman's Fame: With this un-blest,</L>
<L>Toasts live a scorn, and Queens may die a jest.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
This <HI>Phoebus</HI> promis'd, I forget the Year,</L>
<L>When those blue eyes first open'd on the Sphere;</L>
<L>Ascendant <HI>Phoebus</HI> watch'd that hour with care,</L>
<L>Averted half your Parents simple Pray'r,</L>
<L>And gave you <HI>Beauty,</HI> but deny'd the <HI>Pelf</HI></L>
<L>That buys your Sex a Tyrant o'er itself:</L>
<L>That gen'rous God, who Wit and Gold refines,</L>
<L>And ripens Spirits as he ripens Mines,</L>
