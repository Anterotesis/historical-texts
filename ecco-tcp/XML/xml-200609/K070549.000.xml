<P>MR. HUME, a few months be∣fore his death, wrote the following short account of his own Life; and, in a codicil to his will, defired that it might be prefixed to the next edi∣tion of his Works. That edition cannot be published for a considera∣ble time. The Editor, in the mean while, in order to serve the purcha∣sers of the former editions; and, at the same time, to gratify the impa∣tience of the public curiosity; has thought proper to publish it sepa∣rately, without altering even the ti∣tle or superscription, which was written in Mr. Hume's own hand on the cover of the manuscript.</P>

<HEAD>MY OWN LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity; therefore, I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative shall contain lit∣tle more than the History of my Writings; as, indeed, almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity.</P>
<P>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate, which my brother possesses, for several generati∣ons. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College of Jus∣tice; the title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother.</P>
<P>My family, however, was not rich; and being myself a younger brother, my pa∣trimony, according to the mode of my country, was of course very slender. My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and handsome, de∣voted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I passed through the ordinary course of education with success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments. My stu∣dious disposition, my sobriety, and my in∣dustry, gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me; but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning; and while they fan∣cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life. In 1734, I went to Bristol, with some recommendations to eminent merchants, but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of pro∣secuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to main∣tain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in litera∣ture.</P>
<P>During my retreat in France, first at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou, I composed my <HI>Treatise of Human Nature.</HI> After passing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down to my mother and my brother, who lived at his country-house, and was employing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8"/>
Never literary attempt was more unfor∣tunate than my Treatise of Human Nature. It fell <HI>dead born from the press,</HI> without reaching such distinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine tem∣per, I very soon recovered the blow, and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country. In 1742, I printed at Edin∣burgh the first part of my Essays: the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disap∣pointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</P>
<P>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found also, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of put∣ting him under my care and direction, for the state of his mind and health required it.—I lived with him a twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a con∣siderable accession to my small fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747,
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
I received an invitation from the General to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the General, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, now General Grant. These two years were al∣most the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life: I passed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune, which I called independent, though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so; in short I was now master of near a thousand pounds.</P>
<P>I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publishing the Trea∣tise of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscre∣tion, in going to the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, which was published while I was at Turin. But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature. On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account of Dr. Middle∣ton's Free Enquiry, while my performance
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
was entirely overlooked and neglected. A new edition, which had been published at London of my Essays, moral and political, met not with a much better reception.</P>
<P>Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made little or no im∣pression on me. I went down in 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his country house; for my mother was now dead. I there composed the second part of my Essays, which I called Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Princi∣ples of Morals, which is another part of my Treatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile, my bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfor∣tunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation; that the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were demanded. Answers by Reverends, and Right Reverends, came out two or three in a year; and I found, by Dr. Warburton's railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company. However, I had fixed a resolution, which I inflexibly maintained, never to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encourage∣ment, as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year.</P>
<P>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a man of let∣ters. In 1752, were published at Edin∣burgh, where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Mo∣rals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or litera∣ry, incomparably the best. It came unno∣ticed and unobserved into the world.</P>
<P>In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the His∣tory of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the accession of the House of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the misrepresen∣tations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my ex∣pectations of the success of this work. I thought that I was the only historian, that
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
had at once neglected present power, in∣terest, and authority, and the cry of po∣pular prejudices; and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected pro∣portional applause. But miserable was my disappointment: I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detesta∣tion; English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig, and Tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man, who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Straf∣ford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more morti∣fying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could indure the book. I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged.</P>
<P>I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my name, and never more have returned
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
to my native country. But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subse∣quent volume was considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to per∣severe.</P>
<P>In this interval, I published at London my Natural History of Religion, along with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrili∣ty, which distinguish the Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some con∣solation for the otherwise indifferent recep∣tion of my performance.</P>
<P>In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was published the second vo∣lume of my History, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revo∣lution. This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</P>
<P>But though I had been taught by expe∣rience that the Whig party were in posses∣sion of bestowing all places, both in the state and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
study, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty.</P>
<P>In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor. The clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the impressions of public folly, and conti∣nued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edinburgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the English History, which I gave to the pub∣lic in 1761, with tolerable, and but tole∣rable success.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons, to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances, that the copy-mo∣ney given me by the booksellers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen∣dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to set my foot out of it; and retain∣ing the satisfaction of never having pre∣ferred a request to one great man, or even
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
making advances of friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his em∣bassy to Paris, with a near prospect of be∣ing appointed secretary to the embassy, and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, how∣ever inviting, I at first declined, both be∣cause I was reluctant to begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Pa∣ris, would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour: but on his lord∣ship's repeating the invitation, I accepted of it. I have every reason, both of plea∣sure and interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother, General Conway.</P>
<P>Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and stations. The more I resiled from their excessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life.</P>
<P>I was appointed secretary to the embas∣sy; and in summer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was <HI>chargé d' affaires</HI> till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards the end of the year. In the beginning of 1776, I left Paris, and next summer went to Edinburgh, with the same view as for∣merly, of burying myself in a philosophi∣cal retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a competency. But in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be Under-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the person, and my connexions with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining. I returned to Edin∣burgh in 1769, very opulent (for I possess∣ed a revenue of 1000 l. a year), healthy, and, though somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease, and of seeing the increase of my reputation.</P>
<P>In spring 1775, I was struck with a dis∣order in my bowels, which at first gave me
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have, notwith∣standing the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment's abatement of my spirits; insomuch, that were I to name the period of my life, which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I con∣sider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmi∣ties; and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at last with additional lustre, I knew that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present.</P>
<P>To conclude historically with my own character, I am, or rather was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of my∣self, which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of mild dispositions, of command of tem∣per, of an open, social, and cheerful hu∣mour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great modera∣tion in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and lite∣rary; and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased with the recep∣tion I met with from them. In a word, though most men any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her beleful tooth: and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be dis∣armed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to in∣vent and propagate any story to my disad∣vantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH, LL. D. TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><PB REF="20"/><DATELINE>Kirkaldy, Fifeshire, <DATE>Nov. 9, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a real, though a very melan∣choly pleasure, that I sit down to give you some account of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his last illness.</P>
<P>Though, in his own judgment, his disease was mortal and incurable, yet he allowed himself to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he set out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his other papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, shall begin where his ends.</P>
<P>He set out for London towards the end of April, and at Morpeth met with Mr. John Home and myself, who had both come down from London on purpose to see him, expecting to have found him at Edin∣burgh. Mr. Home returned with him,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
and attended him during the whole of his stay in England, with that care and atten∣tion which might be expected from a tem∣per so perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that she might expect me in Scotland, I was under the necessity of continuing my journey. His disease seemed to yield to exercise and change of air, and when he arrived in Lon∣don, he was apparently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was advised to go to Bath to drink the wa∣ters, which appeared for some time to have so good an effect upon him, that even he himself began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opinion of his own health. His symptoms, however, soon returned with their usual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but submitted with the utmost cheerfulness, and the most per∣fect complacency and resignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found himself much weaker, yet his cheerfulness never abated, and he continued to divert himself, as usual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amusement, with the conversa∣tion of his friends; and, sometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whist. His cheerfulness was so great, and his conversation and amuse∣ments run so much in their usual strain,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
that, notwithstanding all bad symptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <Q REND="inline">"I shall tell your friend, Colonel Edmondstone,"</Q> said Doctor Dundas to him one day, <Q REND="inline">"that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery." </Q><Q REND="inline">"Doc∣tor,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"as I believe you would not chuse to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as fast as my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire."</Q> Colo∣nel Edmondstone soon afterwards came to see him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bidding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verses in which the Abbé Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approaching separation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare. Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firmness were such, that his most affectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that so far from being hurt by this frank∣ness, he was rather pleased and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had just received, and which he immedi∣ately showed me. I told him, that though I was sensible how very much he was weakened, and that appearances were in
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
many respects very bad, yet his cheerful∣ness was still so great, the spirit of life seemed still to be so very strong in him, that I could not help entertaining some faint hopes. He answered, <Q REND="inline">"Your hopes are groundless. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's standing, would be a very bad disease at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening, I feel myself weaker than when I rose in the morning; and when I rise in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am sen∣sible, besides, that some of my vital parts are affected, so that I must soon die."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> said I, <Q REND="inline">"if it must be so, you have at least the satisfaction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in par∣ticular, in great prosperity."</Q> He said, that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lucian's Dia∣logues of the Dead, among all the excuses which are alleged to Charon for not entering readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no house to finish, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself. <Q>"I could not well imagine,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"what excuse I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done every thing of consequence which I ever meant to do, and I could at no time expect to leave my relations and
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
friends in a better situation than that in which I am now likely to leave them; I, therefore, have all reason to die content∣ed."</Q> He then diverted himself with inventing several jocular excuses, which he supposed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very surly answers which it might suit the character of Charon to re∣turn to them. <Q REND="inline">"Upon further considera∣tion,"</Q> said he, <Q REND="inline">"I thought I might say to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may see how the Public receives the alterations."</Q> But Charon would answer, <Q REND="inline">"When you have seen the effect of these, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of such excuses; so, honest friend, please step into the boat."</Q> But I might still urge, <Q REND="inline">"Have a little patience, good Charon, I have been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfal of some of the prevailing systems of superstition."</Q> But Charon would then lose all temper and decency. <Q REND="inline">"You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a term? Get into the boat this instant, you lazy loitering rogue."</Q>
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching dissolution with great cheerfulness, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the subject but when the con∣versation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the course of the conversation happened to require: it was a subject indeed which occurred pretty frequently, in consequence of the inquiries which his friends who came to see him naturally made concerning the state of his health. The conversation which I men∣tioned above, and which passed on Thurs∣day the 8th of August, was the last, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become so very weak, that the com∣pany of his most intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulness was still so great, his complaisance and social disposition were still so entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talking more, and with greater exertion, than suited the weakness of his body. At his own desire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edinburgh, where I was staying partly upon his ac∣count, and returned to my mother's house here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wished to see me; the physician who saw him most frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occasionally an account of the state of his health.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26"/>
On the 22d of August, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Since my last, Mr. Hume has passed his time pretty easily, but is much weaker. He sits up, goes down stairs once a day, and amuses himself with reading, but seldom sees any body. He finds that even the con∣versation of his most intimate friends fa∣tigues and oppresses him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impatience, or low spirits, and passes his time very well with the assist∣ance of amusing books.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I received the day after a letter from Mr. Hume himself, of which the following is an extract.<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Edinburgh, <DATE>23d August, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAREST FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P>I go very fast to decline, and last night had a small fever, which I hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illness, but unluckily it has, in a great measure, gone off. I cannot submit to your coming over

here on my account, as it is possible for me to see you so small a part of the day, but Doctor Black can better inform you con∣cerning the degree of strength which may from time to time remain with me. Adieu, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Three days after I received the following letter from Doctor Black.<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Edinburgh, Monday, <DATE>26th August, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Yesterday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be∣tween Thursday and Friday, when his dis∣ease became excessive, and soon weakened him so much, that he could no longer rise out of his bed. He continued to the last perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or feelings of distress. He never dropped the smallest expression of impatience; but when he had occasion to speak to the peo∣ple about him, always did it with affection and tenderness. I thought it improper to write to bring you over, especially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you desiring you not to come. When he be∣came very weak it cost him an effort to speak, and he died in such a happy com∣posure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="28"/>Thus died our most excellent and never to be forgotten friend; concerning whose philosophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge variously, every one approving, or condemning them, according as they hap∣pen to coincide or disagree with his own; but concerning whose character and con∣duct there can scarce be a difference of opi∣nion. His temper, indeed, seemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be al∣lowed such an expression, than that per∣haps of any other man I have ever known. Even in the lowest state of his fortune, his great and necessary frugality never hindered him from exercising upon proper occasions, acts both of charity and generosity. It was a frugality founded, not upon a varice, but upon the love of independency. The ex∣treme gentleness of his nature never weak∣ened either the firmness of his mind, or the steadiness of his resolutions. His con∣stant pleasantry was the genuine effusion of good-nature and good-humour, tem∣pered with delicacy and modesty, and without even the slightest tincture of ma∣lignity, so frequently the disagreeable source of what is called wit in other men. It never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it seldom failed to please and delight, even those who were the objects of it. To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
his great and amiable qualities, which contributed more to endear his conversation. And that gaiety of temper, so agreeable in society, but which is so often accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the most severe application, the most extensive learning, the greatest depth of thought, and a capacity in every respect the most comprehensive.
