<L>BUT what are these to great <HI>Atossa</HI>'s Mind,</L>
<L>Scarce once herself, by Turns all Womankind?</L>
<L>Who with herself, and others from her Birth,</L>
<L>Finds all her Life one Warfare upon Earth;</L>
<L>Shines in exposing Knaves and painting Fools,</L>
<L>Yet is whate'er she hates or ridicules.</L>
<L>No Thought advances, but her eddy Brain</L>
<L>Whirls it about, and down it goes again.</L>
<L>Full sixty Years the World has been her Trade,</L>
<L>The wisest Fool much Time has ever made:</L>
<L>From Loveless Youth to unrespected Age,</L>
<L>No Passion gratify'd except her Rage;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
So much the Fury still out-ran the Wit,</L>
<L>The Pleasure miss'd her, and the Scandal hit;</L>
<L>Who breaks with her, provokes Revenge from Hell,</L>
<L>But he's a bolder Man who dares be well;</L>
<L>Her ev'ry Turn with Violence pursu'd,</L>
<L>Nor more a Storm her Hate, than Gratitude:</L>
<L>To that each Passion turns or soon or late,</L>
<L>Love, if it make her yield, must make her hate,</L>
<L>Superior 's Death! an Equal, what a Curse!</L>
<L>But an Inferior, not Dependant, worse.</L>
<L>Offend her, and she knows not to forgive,</L>
<L>Oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live.</L>
<L>But die, and she'll adore you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alludes to a Temple she erected with a Bust of Queen <HI>Anne</HI> in it, which mouldered away in a few Years.</NOTE>—Then the Bust</L>
<L>And Temple rise,—then fall again to Dust.</L>
<L>Last Night her Lord was all that's good and great;</L>
<L>A Knave this Morning, and his Will a Cheat.</L>
<L>Strange! by the Means defeated of the Ends.</L>
<L>By Spirit, robb'd of Power; by Warmth, of Friends;</L>
<L>By Wealth, of Followers; without one Distress,</L>
<L>Sick of herself thro' very Selfishness,</L>

<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L><HI>Atossa</HI>'s curs'd with ev'ry granted Prayer,</L>
<L>Childless with all her Children, wants an Heir:</L>
<L>To Heirs unknown, descends th' unnumber'd Store,</L>
<L>Or wanders, Heaven directed, to the Poor.</L>

<P>THESE Verses are Part of a Poem, entitled <HI>Characters of Women.</HI> It is generally said, the D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ss gave Mr. <HI>P.</HI> 1000<HI>l.</HI> to suppress them: He took the Money, yet the World sees the Verses; but this is not the first Instance where Mr. <HI>P</HI>'s practical Virtue has fallen very short of those pompous Profes∣sions of it he makes in his Writings.</P>
