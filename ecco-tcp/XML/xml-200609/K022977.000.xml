<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<PB N="1" REF="3"/>
<P ID="CT005481-1">* <HI>Of Taste,]</HI> Some of our little Second-Hand Smatterers in Criticism, will be apt to imagine our Author ought to have wrote <HI>On Taste,</HI> rather than <HI>Of Taste,</HI> as if <HI>Of</HI> and <HI>On</HI> had two different Significations. But Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has declar'd himself in fa∣vour of <HI>Of,</HI> and thereby clapt a Gag into the Mouths of all Gainsayers. His <HI>hoc volo, sic jubeo</HI> is sufficient to make any Ex∣pression▪ pass for Standard, and <HI>stet pro Ratione Voluntas.</HI></P>
<P ID="CT005481-2"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>'Tis strange,</HI> &amp;c.] This is a vast deal too strange to be true; and the Misfortune is, every common Observer knows it to be quite otherwise. The Miser's Enjoyment consists in hoard∣ing up his Wealth, and feasting his Eyes with the Sight there∣of. Our old Friend <HI>Horace</HI> has assured us of this, almost Two Thousand Years ago; for he introduces a Man of this Character, saying, <Q><L>—Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo</L><L>Ipse domi, simul ac Nummos contemplor in Arca.</L></Q></P>
<P ID="CT005481-3"><PB N="2" REF="4"/> <SUP>a</SUP> <HI>It is less strange,</HI> &amp;c.] This Assertion is equally weak, and inconclusive. The Prodigal, like every Body else, lays out his Money in something, which he chuses rather than the Mo∣ney he parts with. And tho' perhaps his Taste in Painting, Ar∣chitecture, &amp;c. may not be altogether so exquisite as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s in Philosophy or Poetry, yet still he certainly tastes the Purchase he makes, better than the Purchase Money; for otherwise, he de∣serves to be begg'd for a Fool for parting with it.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-4"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>Not for himself, he sees, or hears, or eats;]</HI> If this Sentence has any Meaning at all, it must certainly be, either that he sees, or hears, or eats for somebody else or that somebody else; sees, or hears, or eats for him. As for any Body's seeing, or hearing for me, I might not perhaps scruple it much; but for any Body's eat∣ing for me, I should humbly beg he would not insist upon it; my Stomach would never consent to it.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-5"><SUP>c</SUP> <HI>Artists must chuse,</HI> &amp;c.] I cannot forbear owning our Au∣thor perfectly in the right here, in allowing the Prodigal, Artists to chuse for him, when he is incapable of chusing for himself; for who, in his Wits, would not rather employ real Artists, in any Af∣fair, than a Parcel of Blunderers and Blockheads?</P>
<P ID="CT005481-6"><SUP>d</SUP> <HI>He buys]</HI> He buys! Who buys? Not the <HI>Miser,</HI> I hope, his Money is too fast lockt up in his Chest, ever to be let loose on any such Occasions. Nor the <HI>Prodigal!</HI> for he is forc'd to make use of other People's Eyes and Ears to supply some certain Defici∣encies in his own. Who can it be then? Why, it must certainly be the Artists, mentioned in the preceeding Line: But if so, why false Grammar? And why would not <HI>They buy,</HI> have done full as well as <HI>He buys?</HI> This I shall leave to be corrected in his next Edition.</P>

But the World needs not be inform'd, at this Time of Day, that few of These are the Produce of this Island; How famous soever we may be for modern Improvements in Me∣chanicks, Mathematicks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we certainly were never very fa∣mous for Antiquities, Drawings and Coins. <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> are well known to be the grand Magazines for all these; and whoever has not his present Residence in these Parts, must, of Necessity, pur∣chase the Produce of them from Second or Third Hands.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-8"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Rare Monkish Manuscripts for</HI> Hearne <HI>alone,]</HI> Poor <HI>Tom Hearne!</HI> I dare swear, so polite a Genius as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> never once strained his Optick Nerves with poring over one of thy Monkish Manuscripts. <HI>Robert of Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Jeffrey of Monmouth</HI> are quite out of his Way; and he knows no more of <HI>Florence of War∣cester,</HI> nor the <HI>Textus Roffensis,</HI> than a <HI>Dancing Master</HI> does of <HI>Algebra,</HI> or a <HI>Lawyer</HI>'s <HI>Clerk of Divinity.—</HI> But to the Matter in Hand.—I cannot imagine Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI> oblig'd to trot round the Kingdom in quest of Manuscripts, where-ever an old Abbey may have stood; or to travel into foreign Countries wherever such Books may have been dispers'd at the Reformation. 'Tis enough if he knows the Value of them when they are brought to him, and how to oblige the World with them afterwards, at a proper Opor∣tunity.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-9"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>And Books for</HI> Mead,] This worthy Gentleman has a vast and valuable Library, stor'd with all Sorts of Books Foreign and Domestic; and he is not only a Person of extraordinary Learning himself, but one of the greatest Patrons and Encouragers of it, in this Kingdom. However, it is not impossible but he may have bought Books from Second and Third Hands, and he may very likely have some, among so prodigious a Collection, which he has hardly deign'd a reading. But I hope Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Works are none of that Number, tho' he may well save himself the Trouble even of looking into them; for whether Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> knows it or no, he can read <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Statius,</HI> nay, and <HI>Chaucer</HI> and <HI>Shakespear,</HI> in <PB N="4" REF="6"/> their Originals, without Recourse either to a rhiming Translator, or a Modernizer to point him out their Meaning.—But <HI>Mead</HI> is not only famous for Books, but for several choice Curiosities, among which is his celebrated Head of <HI>Homer,</HI> for a Copy of which, if I mistake not, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has been oblig'd to him, to grace his <HI>Odyssey.—</HI> And the World tells strange Stories, if Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> be not oblig'd for the best Part of his own Head to some Body else, who may, not unlikely, meet the same Treatment in his next Per∣formance, as these have done in This.</P>

Sir <HI>Hans</HI> has purchased Rarities from all known Parts of the Globe.—But must he travel to all these Parts him∣self to pick them up? An Age would not bring that about: And between Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> and I, he has much better Business at Home, where he has Wealth enough to purchase whatever valuable Thing is offer'd him; and has, at this Time the richest private Collection in <HI>Europe,</HI> or perhaps in the <HI>Universe.</HI></P>
<P ID="CT005481-11"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Than his fine Wife (my Lord) or finer Whore.]</HI> What a spiteful Insinuation is here, against the poor Artists, that they keep their Whores finer than their Wives. I am sorry to hear our Author is a Batchelor, or we should see how he would manage in that important Affair of Life. He is certainly an Artist, for all the World owns him a Rhimer; and some per∣haps may look upon him as a Reasoner.—But these two Faculties do not always go together; and if they did,—He is not indispensably oblig'd to reason his best on every little Oc∣casion. Rhime may sometimes do the Business full as well with∣out it.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-12"><PB N="5" REF="7"/> <SUP>a</SUP> <HI>For what has</HI> Virro <HI>painted, built, and planted?</HI> &amp;c.] What pity it is that <HI>Virro</HI> did not consult our Author, before he went to work? Had he done that, I dare vouch, all would have been well, tho' every Thing appear'd just as it does. But for want of this <HI>Unum Necessarium,</HI> for want of consulting this universal Genius, his Paintings are monstrous, his Buildings barba∣rous, his Planting ridiculous, and he has no Taste, or what's worse, an ill one.</P>

How does he know, now, but <HI>Squires</HI> and private <HI>Gentlemen</HI> may put in for their respective Shares; If so, what an Inundation of Taste will then break in upon us: The Nation will be over run with it, and the Government o∣blig'd at last to put a Stop to it, as a growing Evil.</P>

<P ID="CT005481-16"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>Oft have you hinted to your Brother Peer,</HI> &amp;c.] How much had the World been obliged to this noble Lord, if he had once generously published that grand Secret to the World, which he so oft hinted to his Brother Peer in private Conversation.—But if he had, others would have been presented with that Experience, which they have since purchased at so dear a Rate; and this Lord's Buildings would never have been found <HI>Non-pareils,</HI> had not some hundreds fallen short of them, out of an Ambition of excelling them.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-17"><SUP>c</SUP> <HI>Good Sense which only is the Gift of Heaven,</HI> &amp;c.] This is a much greater Compliment to good Sense, than ever one would have expected from Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI> But the Truth is, he has a Mind to set Sense and the Sciences at Variance, by shewing that they have not the least Affinity with each other; and insinuating, that 'tis no great Difficulty for a Man to become an Adept in any of the Seven Sciences, tho' he was a Changeling himself, and his whole Family had been Fools for fifteen Generations.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-18"><PB N="7" REF="9"/> <SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Begin with</HI> Sense, &amp;c.] 'Tis somewhat odd that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> should be capable of giving so good Advice to others, and mind <PB N="8" REF="10"/> it so little himself.—What a woeful Beginning did he make, and how miserably did he blunder between his Miser and Prodi∣gal!—But enough of that:—I am surpriz'd to find Sense here styl'd the Soul of every Art or Science, when there was a strong Insinuation not much above a dozen Lines before, that they had very little Business together; or, in other Words, that Sense might, without any Detriment to the Sciencies, be divorc'd from them, and put to a separate Maintenance.</P>

<P ID="CT005481-22"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>The Wood supports the Plain;]</HI> I have heard of a Plain sup∣porting a Wood a thousand Times, because the Plain was below, and the Wood above.—But how Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Wood comes to support his Plain, I own myself unable to determine, un∣less His was a subterraneous Wood, which supported the Plain above, as a convenient Number of Columns do a Stately Cu∣pola.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-23"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>His bloomy Beds,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>with Silver quiv'ring Rills maeander'd o'er.]</HI> This is the most mysterious Passage I have lately met with. How, in the Name of Goodness, can Silver quiv'ring Rills maeander Beds o'er. Had it been maeander them thro', that is, divide them with a winding Stream, it had been Sense; but <PB N="10" REF="12"/> then the next Rhime must have suffered.—But now I recol∣lect, these superterraneous Rills were, perhaps, designed for his subterraneous Wood; and as such, I shall leave them to perform their Office.</P>

Where, the Majesty of Thought, The Sublimity of Diction?—But to pass these by, and proceed to the Sentiment. I can see no Manner of Wonder, why a Gentleman, in his declining Years should be tired with the Diversions of his Youth, when we find it common for most of us to dislike those Things to Day which we doted on but Yesterday.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-25"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>His Son's fine Taste an op'ner</HI> Vista <HI>loves,</HI> &amp;c.] The Father was of the same Opinion before he died, (if we may suppose <HI>Vil∣lario</HI> and <HI>Sabinus</HI> Relations, and believe what has been advanced half a Dozen Lines before.) But how comes his Son to have a Taste so much finer than his Father? The Father planted noble Gardens in his Youth, and delighted to walk in the Fields in his <PB N="11" REF="13"/> old Age. However he had his Choice, and might have taken a Turn in his Gardens whenever he had thought fit.—The Son, to shew a Specimen of his superior Taste, makes quick Work, grubs up his Father's Woods, and converts his thriving Plants to Broom∣sticks.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-26"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Yet hence the</HI> Poor <HI>are cloth'd,</HI> &amp;c.] This would certainly be a fine Reflection, were it not design'd for the sake of a Stroke of Satyr in the next Stanza. <HI>Villario</HI> is here brought upon the Stage again, and accus'd for what every wise and good Man ought to applaud him; namely, for setting the Poor to Work, and rather chusing to have his Money circulate thro' the Neighbour∣hood, than suffer it to lye pil'd up in his Chests, and see his Poor Dependants starve for want of Employment.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-27"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>Another Age shall see,</HI> &amp;c.] This is no more than what has ever been common to all Nations in all the later Ages of the World. The Stately Palaces of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Mo∣narchs lye now buried under huge Heaps of Dust and Rubbish: All <PB N="12" REF="14"/> the pleasant Gardens of Ancient <HI>Rome</HI> are long since turn'd to a Wilderness: Nay, the very situation of several of the most renowned Cities in the World are now become so obscure, that Travellers into those Parts, cannot agree where they have for∣merly stood.—In one Word, the whole of the Story rests here. <HI>Villario</HI> pleas'd himself with Planting and Gardening, and by that Means kept his poor Neighbourhood from Want. A descendant of his, of a different Taste (or, if Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> pleases, of a finer Taste) may possibly, some Ages hence, cut down his shady Woods, plow up his fine Walks, and turn the whole to Corn-Ground again. This will also be Employment and Bread for the Neighbourhood, whenever it happens.—And whether Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> be sensible of it, or no, Satyr rebounds back upon the Author, whenever it is pointed at a wrong Object.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-28"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Where all cry out, what Sums are thrown away!</HI> &amp;c.] 'Tis somewhat strange that all should conspire, with one Voice, to blame <HI>Timon</HI>'s profuseness in Building; and what is stranger still, how it came to our Author's Knowledge. But perhaps this is only his private Opinion, which he has a mind to father upon the Publick. —Be that as it will, any other Extravagance would have produced as ill an Effect, and several, much worse.—But <HI>Timon</HI> has thrown away vast Sums in Building.—The Publick <PB N="13" REF="15"/> certainly gathered up as much as he threw away, and this was no more than changing Hands. The whole was undoubtedly gi∣ven to Stone-Cutters, Carvers, Statuaries, Bricklayers, Carpenters, Joyners, Labourers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All the Materials too were undoubtedly the Produce of our own Island, except a little foreign Marble, and some other Trifles of small Importance. So that such a private Expence is so far from being a Publick Loss, that the Nation would not be one Farthing the poorer, if fifty such Fabricks were erected every ten or a dozen years.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-29"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Who but must laugh the Master]</HI> Who but must laugh at our Poet for writing such barbarous English? I am really surpriz'd to think how he suffered such an Impropriety to escape him. The Truth is, <HI>laugh at the Master</HI> would have stretch'd the Verse a Syllable beyond its ordinary Length, for which Rea∣son He, having more Regard to Sound than Sense, chose to omit the Particles.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-30"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>A puny Insect, shiv'ring at a Breeze!]</HI> The puny Insect in this Page, is declared a Lord in the next; and it is undenyable that there may be little Lords as well as great ones.—Every one who has the Honour to be acquainted with Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> owns him to be a fine, tall, proper, well-shap'd agreeable, jolly Gentleman, with a Constitution strong enough to enable him to defy Winds and Weather: But how he happens, here, to reflect upon a little Lord, meerly for shrinking at a fit of Cold Weather, is what I cannot well reconcile, either to good Sense, or good Manners. However, if our Author has here, confin'd himself to one Day, a he assures us, it seems a little extraordinary, methinks, that my <PB N="14" REF="16"/> Lord should be taken with a shivering Fit when several of his Visitors were sweating upon a Hot Terras. But if he takes in the Compass of several Months, 'tis not unlikely but the whole Company might shiver and sweat at different. Times of the Year, and by that Means keep his Lordship in Countenance.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-31"><SUP>a</SUP> <HI>A Lake behind improves the keenness of the Northern Wind.]</HI> 'Tis not improbable that the Lake mentioned here, may be the same with the Pond or Ocean in the preceeding Page; if so, it is no great Wonder it should chill the Part of the House adja∣cent to it, which our Author has assured us was the North Side. And if the Lake lay on the North Side of the House, then the House most certainly stood on the South Side of the Lake.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-32"><SUP>b</SUP> <HI>On every Side you look, behold the Wall!]</HI> If a Person could be∣hold my Lord's Garden Wall on every Side, from any particular Station within, 'tis strange how it was capable of containing that Down of a Parterre and that Ocean of a Pond: or how that <HI>Brob∣dignagian</HI> Palace, or Town of a House (mentioned about half a Score Lines ago) could lye adjacent to it.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-33"> <PB N="15" REF="17"/> <SUP>a</SUP> <HI>Grove nods at Grove, each Ally has a Brother,</HI> &amp;c.] This is the very first Time I ever heard either a House or Gardens condemned for Regularity. Groves, Allys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are, or may be all, in their proper Places, beautiful and agreeable; and why an exact Regularity should make them otherwise, is impossible to know. The best of all the Gardens, as well as Fabricks, of an∣cient Times, were perfectly Regular: And had Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> been the Designer of these, I dare almost venture to assert, he would either have plann'd them out in a regular Form, or every good Judge would have condemn'd his Gothick Fancy.</P>
<P ID="CT005481-34"><SUP>b</SUP> The <HI>suff'ring Eye inverted Nature sees,</HI> &amp;c.] 'Tis a thou∣sand Pities, one of so exquisite a Taste as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is own'd to be, should meet with any Thing disagreeable.

A dry Fountain, insupportable; (This indeed ought to have been set a playing to welcome so great a Personage to Lord <HI>Timon</HI>'s <HI>Villa)</HI> and an unshaded Summer-House, an unpardonable Object.</P>

But should the Case prove otherwise, and our Author takes my Lord's Igno∣rance, as most of the World do his Learning, meerly from Hear-say, then he will go a great Way towards the forfeiting so amiable a Character.—It is not improbable that he may have seen the dated Backs of my Lord's Books, and have made no further Observations than that some of them were bound in <HI>Vellum,</HI> and others in Past-board.

Solomon has assured us, long enough ago, that <HI>God dwells not in Houses made with Hands.</HI> And tho' the <HI>Pagans</HI> were taught that their Local Dieties might he confin'd within cer∣tain Limits, yet the wiser Sort among them, condemn'd the No∣tion; and <HI>Christianity</HI> has not only set us free from that, but a Thousand other Fopperies; so that whoever advances such Doc∣trine, at this Time of the Day, is making a fresh Attempt to put a Hook in our Noses, and a Bridle in our Lips, to draw us back to <HI>Paganism.</HI> or, which is much the same, to <HI>Popery.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF we will look a little into the Conduct and Custom of the World, it may not appear so extraordinary as some have thought it, that Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> because he cannot be the <HI>Foun∣tain of Honour</HI> to Mankind, should be fond of usurping the <HI>Fountain of Infamy,</HI> and please himself with dealing out a Fund of <HI>dirty</HI> Pro∣motions from that <HI>inexhaustible</HI> Spring. And as nothing yields a more sincere Delight than to see the Workings of a <HI>beneficent</HI> Mind; I doubt not but every <HI>good</HI> Man is rejoiced to observe this <HI>Great Prince</HI> creating <HI>Dunces</HI> upon <HI>Dunces,</HI> of his own free Will and Motion, with so much Alacrity, and all in a due Subordination. It is
<PB N="32" REF="34"/> certain, I ought to be very well satisfied with my Share of <HI>Honours</HI> in this Kingdom of <HI>Dul∣ness,</HI> since the Preamble to my Patent is, That <HI>He could not find One more fit to wear them.</HI> I would not willingly act like the Favourite, whom <HI>Shakespeare</HI> somewhere describes, who being made proud by his Prince, advanced his Pride against the Power that bred it: But I would rather, like a grateful Favourite, lay out my Talents in asserting the Legality of my Master's Title to those Dominions, in which he exercises so free a Sway, and from whence he so unsparingly dispenses his <HI>Promotions.</HI></P>
<P>And since I have mention'd <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> (one of the Tributaries by Conquest made subservi∣ent to his Throne) I will attempt to convince Unbelievers, by some few Instances of his <HI>Prowess,</HI> with what a Strength of Arm, and Fineness of Head, he has <HI>humbled</HI> that proud Adversary to his Sceptre; Or, (to step out of all <HI>Metaphor</HI> at once) I will attempt to shew with what Fidelity he has perform'd the <HI>dull</HI> Office of an <HI>Editor,</HI> hardly without aiming to under∣stand his Author himself, or having any Ambi∣tion that his Readers ever should: Or, where he does aim, to shew he has such a happy Fatality at Mistaking, that we are to wish he would not explain the Author into <HI>Nonsense.</HI> Give me Leave to subjoin some Examples just as they oc∣cur to my Observation.</P>
<P><HI>I. Much ado about Nothing. Act. 3. Scene 5.</HI> Sometimes fashioning them like <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s Soldiers▪
<PB N="33" REF="35"/> in the <HI>reechy</HI> Painting, sometimes like the God <HI>Bel</HI>'s Priests in the old Church-Window, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> is pleas'd to tell us, that <HI>reechie</HI> sig∣nifies <HI>valuable.</HI> But the Poet had no Intention here of complimenting the Richness, or Value of the Painting: On the other Hand, he would speak despieably of it, as of a common <HI>Wall-Painting;</HI> as he does in another Play of the Story of the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> and the <HI>German</HI>-hunt∣ing in <HI>Water-Work.</HI> We may be pretty sure therefore our Author wrote, <HI>the</HI> reechy <HI>Paint∣ing;</HI> i. e. Smoke-dry'd, exposed to Weather, or reeking and steaming with Nastiness. There are two other Passages, where, I remember, this Word again occurrs in our Author.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Coriolanus. Act 2. Scene 4.</BIBL>
<L>—The Kitchen-Maukin pins</L>
<L>Her richest Lockram 'bout her <HI>reechy Neck,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<Q><BIBL>And Hamlet. Act 3. Scene 11.</BIBL>
<L>And let him for a Pair of <HI>reechy</HI> Kisses,</L>
<L>Or padling in your Neck, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Now if <HI>reechy,</HI> in either of these Passages, sig∣nifies <HI>valuable,</HI> I shall be content to allow Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Gloss upon the Passage first quoted.</P>
<Q><BIBL>II. Henry VIII. Act 1. Scene 1.</BIBL>
<L>One sare that promises no <HI>Element</HI></L>
<L>In such a Business.</L></Q>
<P>Here we are told that <HI>Element</HI> is <HI>Rudiment,</HI> or <HI>Beginning:</HI> But here again the common Sense of the Passage is explain'd away. <HI>Shake∣speare</HI> means no more than that, He is One who
<PB N="34" REF="36"/> promises no <HI>Qualifications,</HI> no <HI>Talents</HI> for such a Business; or, is not in a <HI>Sphere</HI> for it. In these Acceptations, I think, our Poet generally uses the Phrase. So,</P>
<Q><BIBL>Merry Wives of Windsor. Act 4. Scene 4.</BIBL>
<L>And such Dawbry as this is beyond our <HI>Ele∣ment.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><BIBL>Twelfth-Night. Act 3. Scene 2.</BIBL>
<L>What you would is out of my Welkin, I might say <HI>Element,</HI></L>
<L>but the Word is over-worn.</L></Q>
<Q><BIBL>And again. Act 3. Scene 9.</BIBL>
<P>You are idle shallow Things, I am not of your <HI>Element.</HI></P></Q>
<P>In every one of which Quotations Mr. <HI>Pope's</HI> Gloss would be out of the Way: It were not amiss, perhaps, that this Commentator should remember, <HI>A Man may sometimes be out of his</HI> Element.</P>
<Q><BIBL>III. King Lear. Act 3. Scene 2.</BIBL>
<L>Crack Nature's Mould, all<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>All Relations, or kindred Elements that com∣pose Man, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> expounds it. But, with Submission, the Text must first be slightly a∣mended, and we shall easily come at a better Explication. Read,</P><Q><L>—all <HI>Germins</HI> spill at once, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>i. e. <HI>Germina,</HI> Seeds of Matter.</L></Q>
<P>So, again, in <BIBL>Mackbeth. Act 4. Scene 2.</BIBL></P>
<L>—tho' the Treasure</L></NOTE> <HI>Germains</HI> spill at once</L>
<L>That make ingrateful Man.</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
<L>Of Nature's <HI>Germins</HI> tumble all together,</L>
<L>Ev'n 'till Destruction sicken.—</L></Q>
<P>For so it must here like wise be corrected. And to put this Emendation beyond all Doubt, I will produce one more Passage, where our Author not only uses the same Thought again, but the Word that ascertains my Explication into the Bargain.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Winter's Tale. Act 4. Scene 9.</BIBL>
<L>Let Nature crush the Sides o'th'Earth together,</L>
<L>And marr the <HI>Seeds</HI> within.</L></Q>
<Q><BIBL>IV. King Lear, Act 1. Scene 6.</BIBL>
<L>—wherefore should I</L>
<L>Stand in the Plague of Custom, and permit</L>
<L>The <HI>Nicety</HI> of Nations to deprive me, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I would very willingly know, as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> de∣clares against his having made any <HI>Innovations,</HI> from what Authority he has adopted this quaint Word, <HI>Nicety.</HI> It is in none of the Old Co∣pies, that ever I have seen; and if he derives it either from Mr. <HI>Row</HI>'s Edition, or Mr. <HI>Tate</HI>'s Alteration of this Play, he must give me Leave to except against it. The Old Reading, (which, I presume, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> did not know what to make of) 'tis true, is corrupted.—<HI>The</HI> Curi∣osity <HI>of Nations.</HI>—but out of it I will venture to restore the Poet's genuine Word;</P>
<Q>The <HI>Courtesy</HI> of Nations to deprive me, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
<P>Our accurate <HI>Editor</HI> might have observ'd, that his Author chuses the very Term upon the like Occasion, in another of his Plays. <HI>As you like it.</HI> Act 1. Scene 1.</P>
<Q><PB N="36" REF="38"/> The <HI>Courtesy</HI> of Nations allows you my bet∣ter, in that you are the <HI>first-born.</HI></Q>
<P>So, in another Place, he substitutes it for Birth∣right.
<BIBL><HI>Cymbelyne.</HI> Act 4. Scene 8.</BIBL></P>
<Q><L>—aye hopeless</L>
<L>To have the <HI>Courtesy</HI> your Cradle promis'd.</L></Q>
<P>And, for the more vulgar Use of the Phrase, I do not doubt but Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> may have heard, that certain Lands and Honours are held by the <HI>Cour∣tesy</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<Q><BIBL>V. Measure for Measure. Act. 3. Scene 4.</BIBL>
<L>—say to thyself,</L>
<L>From their abominable and beastly Touches,</L>
<L>I drink, I eat <HI>away</HI> myself, and live.</L></Q>
<P>This is a very excellent Instance of our Editor's <HI>Sagacity,</HI> and I wish heartily he would have obliged us with his physical Solution, how a Man may <HI>eat away</HI> himself and <HI>live.</HI> Till he does this, I would crave Leave to substitute by Conjecture;</P>
<Q><L>—say to thyself,</L>
<L>By their abominable, and beastly Touches,</L>
<L>I drink, I eat, <HI>array</HI> myself, and live.</L></Q>
<P><HI>i. e.</HI> I feed myself and put Cloaths on my Back, by exercising the vile Trade of a Bawd.</P>

<Q><BIBL>VII. Love's Labour Lost. Act 3. Scene 3.</BIBL>
<L>This <HI>Signior</HI> Junio, giant dwarf, Dan <HI>Cupid.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Some Readers, 'tis probable, would have been glad to know why the Poets call <HI>Cupid</HI> Signior <HI>Junio.</HI> Has it an Allusion to any old Tale, or to any Charactar in any old Play? No such Thing. As there is a Contrast of Terms in <HI>Giant-Dwarf,</HI> so I have a great Suspicion there should be in these other Words, if we could retrieve the true Reading. And why might it not have been?</P>
<Q><L>This <HI>Senior-junior,</HI> giant-Dwarf, Dan <HI>Cupid.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>i. e.</HI> this Old Young Man. I am sure there is a Description afterwards of him in this very Play, which will be no bad Confirmation of this Conjecture.</P>
<Q><L>That was the way to make his Godhead wax,</L>
<L>For he hath been <HI>Five thousand Years</HI> a <HI>Boy.</HI></L>
<BIBL>VIII. Ibid. Act 4. Scene 3.</BIBL></Q>

<PB N="38" REF="40"/> of Invention <HI>imitary</HI> is Nothing: So doth the Hound his Master, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sagacity with a Vengeance! What? Neither osund Sense, true Grammar, right Inserence, Pointing, or Meaning?—Then, what is <HI>In∣vention imitary?</HI> Invention and Imitation are certainly two distinct Things. In short, is Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> won't merrily call it <HI>pidling,</HI> I will venture to give Light to this very difficult Passage. The Speech is by a Pedant, who frequently throws in a Word of <HI>Latin</HI> amongst his <HI>English;</HI> and he is here flourishing upon the Merit of Invention, beyond that of Imitation, or copy∣ing after another. Correct it thus, and all is plain and intelligible.</P>
<P><Q>—And why indeed <HI>Naso,</HI> but for smelling out the odoriserous Flowers of Fancy? the Jerks of Invention?—<HI>imitari,</HI> is nothing; so doth the Hound his Mlaster, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>imitari, <HI>i. e.</HI> to imitate, copy, <HI>or</HI> follow after.</P>
<Q><BIBL>IX. Titus Andronicus. Act 3. Scene 3.</BIBL>
<L>Which of your Hands hath not defended <HI>Rome,</HI></L>
<L>And rear'd alost the bloody Battle-Ax,</L>
<L>Writing Destruction on the Enemies <HI>Castle?</HI></L></Q>
<P>Sagacity again! unless Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> means an Im∣provement of the <HI>Art Military,</HI> by teaching us that it was ever a Custom to hew down Castles with a Battle-Ax. Or, how if he should have a Mind to tell us, that they wore <HI>Castles,</HI> former∣ly, upon their Heads for <HI>defensive</HI> Armour? There is, indeed a Passage in <HI>Troilus</HI> and <HI>Cressida,</HI> which such a Commentator might take in such a Sense.</P>
<Q><PB N="39" REF="41"/> <HI>—And,</HI> Diomede,</Q>
<P><HI>Stand fast and wear a</HI> Castle <HI>on thy Head,</HI> &amp;c. But as I cannot come in to this Interpretation, I shall venture to read the Passage in <HI>Andronicus</HI> thus,</P>
<P>Writing Destruction on the Enemies <HI>Caske?</HI></P>
<P>A broken <HI>k</HI> in the Manuscript might be mista∣ken for a <HI>tl,</HI> and thus a Castle was built at once: But I think it would be something easier to split an <HI>Helmet</HI> with a Battle-Ax, than cut down a <HI>Castle,</HI> and that is one Reason which induces me to propose this Reading.</P>
<P>I had design'd to throw in another Emenda∣tion upon the Word <HI>Castle;</HI> but I have already transgress'd the Limits of a Letter, and there are two, or three, Topicks still behind, that I have an Occasion to touch upon.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s DUNCIAD having lately made its Appearance in so pompous a Shape, with <HI>Notes variorum,</HI> (I am sorry the Editor could not spare us this short Scrap in a <HI>single</HI> Lan∣guage;) I am very well content to pass over the <HI>Slander</HI> of his <HI>Wit;</HI> but ought not, as I apprehend, to rest Silent under <HI>that</HI> of his <HI>Malice,</HI> in which he would fix a pretended Charge of Ingratitude upon Me, a Vice, I hope, of all others the least ingrasted in my Nature. This Charge is, <Q>That during the Space of two Years, while Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> was preparing his Edition of <HI>Shakespeare,</HI> I, who had then some Correspondence with him, and was sol∣liciting Favours by Letters, did wholly con∣ceal
<PB N="40" REF="42"/> my Design (upon that Author) till after his Publication.</Q></P>
<P>To one Part of this Accusation I have re∣ply'd in a former Letter in this <HI>Paper.</HI> To say I concealed my Design, is a slight Mis∣take: for I had no such certain Design, till I saw how <HI>incorrect</HI> an Edition Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> had gi∣ven the Publick. To the other Part, I think, I dare securely charge my Memory with all the <HI>Favours</HI> that ever I ventur'd to ask of Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI> and I challenge him to produce my Let∣ters against me, if he thinks there is any Room for it. The first Favour that I ask'd, was, when I introduced a Play upon the Stage, that he would assist me in a few Tickets towards my Benefit. In about a Month after this Request, I received my Packet back, with this civil Excuse, That he had been all the while from home, and had not my Parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it. This, I confess, induced me, when I put out my Proposals for <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> to sollicit Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> for this <HI>Second Favour,</HI> that he would please to recommend <HI>that</HI> my <HI>Design,</HI> if it did not interfere with his own Affair of the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> To this Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> reply'd by Letter, <Q>That <HI>he was glad I had undertaken this Work, and should be as glad to promote my Interest, notwithstanding his own Subscription to the</HI> Odyssey: <HI>That his own Awkwardness, and indeed Inability, of solliciting in any Kind, made him quite use∣less
<PB N="41" REF="43"/> to his own Interest; but that he might not be intirely so to mine, he would ask those of his Friends for me, with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing.</HI></Q>—But from that Day to the Publication of my <HI>Shake∣speare Restored,</HI> (an Interval of above Two Years) I never received one Line more from Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> no Intimation of <HI>one</HI> Subscriber by his Interest, not even an Order that I should put his <HI>own</HI> Name down in my List. Upon this naked Fact, I submit the Censure both of my <HI>Obligations</HI> and <HI>Ingratitude.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Publick</HI> should not have been troubled with this State of the Case, had not these Insi∣nuations been industriously propagated at this Crisis, both to hurt my Interest in my <HI>Subscrip∣tion</HI> for my <HI>Remarks on</HI> SHAKESPEARE, which will now shortly appear in the World; and in that <HI>Play,</HI> which is designed for my <HI>Benefit</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> next in the Theatre at <HI>Drury Lane.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Double Falshood.</NOTE> It is my Misfortune, I can boast but of a very scanty Interest, and much less Merit; and, con∣sequently, Both are the more easily to be shock∣ed. I had no Method, but This, of appealing to those Many, whom I have not the Honour of approaching, for their <HI>Favour:</HI> and of hum∣bly hoping it the rather, because all my poor Attempts in Writing are calculated to entertain, and none <HI>at the Expence of any Man's Character.</HI></P>
