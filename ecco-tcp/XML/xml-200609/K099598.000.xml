<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentle Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE good Town of <HI>Ipswich</HI> now boasts the Honour of <HI>my Birth,</HI> as it for∣merly did that of the great Cardinal <HI>Wolsey.</HI></P>
<P>I was conceived in <HI>Sin</HI> and brought forth in <HI>Iniquity, Anno</HI> 1680, so that I am double the Age of my Cousin <HI>Stephen Duck,</HI> and have therefore, you may rationally sup∣pose, <HI>Ploughed, Harrowed,</HI> and <HI>Threshed,</HI>
<PB REF="6"/>
twice as long, and all to no Purpose, unless the good Earl of <HI>Macclesfield</HI> will likewise read some of my <HI>Parnassian</HI>-Labours to our most Gracious Queen; but, I live in hopes that his Lordship will grant me this humble Boon, and that my Kinsman and I, may share one equal Fate.</P>
<P>As to my Education, the most learned Dr. <HI>Arthur Duck,</HI> being my Godfather, I was by his Interest got upon the Foundation of <HI>Eton</HI>-College, and having gone through my School-Studies, I was, as well as my Country∣man <HI>Thomas Tusser,</HI> for sometime a Student in the University of <HI>Cambridge.</HI> In this seminary of the Muses, our <HI>Alma-Mater</HI> being peevish, fretful, and generally out of Humour, I could not so much as Rhime my self into a College-Fellowship. This I took, as <HI>Hudibras</HI> says, in great <HI>Dudgeon,</HI> more especially, since it is well known that the whole <HI>Race of the DUCKS were born Poets.</HI></P>
<P>I left <HI>King's</HI>-College, and came to assist my Parents in their Farming-Business at <HI>Ipswich</HI>; where I soon found that <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Hops</HI> came to a much better Market than <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>La∣tin.</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
Tho' in this first Part of my Rustic-Miscellany,<Q><L>I hope th' impartial Reader will discern,</L>
<L>I ne'er invok'd the Muses in a Barn.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the Death of my intestate Parents, being an only Child, there fell to me, by right of Inheritance, a very decent Country-Legacy, <HI>viz.</HI> Good store of Grain, the Pastures well stockt with Cattle, Provender for their Win∣ter-Sustenance, and a round sum of Money. But, as <HI>Horace</HI> says,<Q><L>My Way-ward, wandring Mind did not approve,</L>
<L>My happy State; I was inclin'd to rove:</L></Q></P>
<P>And soon experienced the fatal Consequences attending such a Temper. In short, I had no Notion of foreign Travel; nothing would serve me, but making the Tour of <HI>Change-Alley</HI>; where, in that memorable Year of Chronology 1720, I fell a Victim on the Altar which made a daily Sacrifice both of <HI>Cit</HI> and <HI>Bumpkin.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having sunk the <HI>Scholar</HI> in the <HI>Farmer</HI>; and the <HI>Farmer</HI> having undergone a <HI>South-Sea</HI>
<PB REF="8"/>
Ship wreck; I am now reduced to my Kins∣man's Pristine Vocation of <HI>God speed the Plough.</HI></P>
<P>My Wages, are indeed, five Shillings and Six-pence <HI>per</HI> Week, our County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> giving one Shilling more than they do in <HI>Wilt∣shire</HI>; tho' alas, at this Price, it is with great Difficulty that <HI>Buckle</HI> and <HI>Throng,</HI> as we say, are brought together. However, I am in hopes of seeing better Days,<Q>Redeunt <HI>Saturnia</HI> Regna.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, in one Word, my sole Trust is in my noble Patron, therefore<Q><L>Whate'er thro' <HI>Carolina</HI>'s Hand is sent,</L>
<L>I'll praise Earl <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> and be Content.</L></Q></P>
