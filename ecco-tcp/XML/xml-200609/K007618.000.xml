<HEAD>PREFATORY DEDICATION, TO <HI>Mrs <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/></HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>Edications, <HI>Madam,</HI> ought in Po∣licy to be addrest to the most powerful, and in Justice to the most deserving. These I think I have united by applying to You in this Manner, who have gain'd the former of these Advantages by means of the latter. Accomplishments like Your's give the most absolute Authority of any: I mean that over the Judgments, as well as Hearts of Mankind.</P>
<P>I intended here, <HI>Madam,</HI> after the Man∣ner of other well-meaning Dedicators, to have given some Sketches of Your Cha∣racter. Not so much from the Ostenta∣tion of my Art in describing, as of the peculiar Diligence I have used in observ∣ing it. An indifferent Painter may trace some Features of his Sov'reign's Face, whose Loyalty has render'd him accurate in studying the Original—Besides, 'Twere

hard a Lady of Your Perfections shou'd be the only one exempted from the Pleasure of being acquainted with 'em. 'Tis true, You have a quick Eye, and penetrating Judgment in distinguishing both natural, and moral Beauties: But You must inevi∣tably remain a Stranger to the greatest, were it not for the Assistance of those im∣portant Utensils, a Poet and a Looking∣Glass.</P>
<P>'Twere dangerous indeed You might suffer by any Representation I am capable of. But 'twas not Incapacity alone dis∣courag'd me. There is something in Your Character vastly disadvantageous to any that attempts it. To proclaim You possess'd of every imaginable good Quality, wou'd be saying it was Day, when the Sun shines in its Meridian. As for Your Faults, (if You have any,) they indeed are far enough from being liable to the former Exception: but the extreme Difficulty I shou'd have found in selecting a few minute ones, (And some I must have selected, if possible, as the Shades of my <HI>Piece</HI>;) together with the small Share of Credit I shou'd have gain'd in the World, dis-hearten'd me. Such indeed were my only Objections. Unless I may adjoin this, that to Strangers your real and genuine Character must have
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="y"/>
pass'd for Flattery. I say to Strangers, for, where you are known, You must be acknowledg'd incapable of it: As the Sun's Brightness can be set off by no Allu∣sion. Hence, in short, I laid aside all thoughts of a Portraiture. Those, that wou'd love You as You deserve, must know You; as necessarily, as those, who know You, must consequently love You.</P>
<P>As to the Poetry, I beg Leave to de∣clare, that 'tis the Product of a young Ge∣nius, little exercis'd in Versification. And the Muses, you know, <HI>Madam,</HI> are not like a great many of their Sex, that have the most Esteem for those, who neglect them; tho' they have had sometimes, in Appearance. <HI>Horace,</HI> and <HI>Swift</HI> (whom to you I wou'd chuse to mention) have at∣tended them whole Mornings at their <HI>Toi∣lette,</HI> that they might conduct them into the World, in a more agreeable Undress. But my Negligences, <HI>Madam,</HI> are of such a Nature, that I must beg you'd impute them to Disuse and Inexperience. How∣ever, by this Confession, I may proba∣bly put you in Mind of a Lady, who, having thrum'd over a Spinnet for a con∣siderable Space, without the least shew of Harmony, took much pains to prove she had never play'd before. 'Tis with an
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Author much the same as with a Sports∣man; <HI>Hippolitus</HI> may excuse his Ill-success to himself, and, perhaps justly alledge se∣veral alleviating Circumstances; But in vain may he attempt his vindication to the World. That has been so frequently de∣luded by these Apologies, that it has made it a Rule to fix the Fault upon the Marks∣man.</P>
<P>I indeed ever despair'd of affording much entertainment this way to a Lady of your refin'd Taste: And I'm positive, that Indolence, has with me prov'd, and always will do, more than a Ballance to any <HI>other</HI> Ambition. This is my only Encou∣ragement, that, as one almost insensibly con∣forms to a taste one very much admires, I can't but think these Trifles won't prove absolutely disagreeable to Your's.</P>
<P>You'll perhaps find other Names in these Pages, than that, which includes all that's agreeable, and is indeed the most compre∣hensive word that is; I mean your own. But as there is some thing mean in an aver∣sion to the Praises of another, or a con∣tinual Apprehension of being rival'd, which I take to be it's original; I'm secure of giving You no uneasiness. Especially, since a Lady of Your Merit may give all others infinitely more than their due, without the least Shadow of Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
I ask Pardon for the Pedantry of Latin Mottoes and Quotations: But You may ea∣sily dispense with the loss of them, whether You consider them, merely as a Compliance with custom, or as certain scraps of Anti∣quity, to indemnify the Poet with those Critic's, who approve only what's ancient. As there are some, who fix a tutelary Piece of Iron on their Thresholds, to elude the Fury of Ill-designing <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the happiness of being possess'd of Merit, is to shew one's Approbation of those who are; And this is really no small addition to a Man's Character. So that, shou'd these Papers appear ever so ridicu∣lous, I shall value them on <HI>one</HI> Account; And shou'd their Fame prove equal to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, I shou'd value them on none so much as <HI>that</HI>; which is, that they enable me to declare openly how much I am,</P>

<L><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>ITHER, dear Boy, direct thy wan∣dring Eyes,</L>
<L>'Tis here the lovely Vale of <HI>Plea∣sure</HI> lies.</L>
<L>Debate no more—to me thy self resign;</L>
<L>Her mossy Caves, her Groves, and all are mine.</L>
<L>For me the Goddess opes her various Pow'r,</L>
<L>Springs in a Tree, or blossoms in a Flow'r:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="8"/>
To please my Ear she breaths celestial Strains:</L>
<L>To please my Eye, with Lillies strews the Plains:</L>
<L>To form my Couch in mossy Beds she grows:</L>
<L>To gratify my Smell she blooms a Rose.</L>
<L>Oft' in some Nymph the Deity I find,</L>
<L>Where in one Form the various Sweets are join'd.</L>
<L>Yield but to me,—a Choir of Nymphs shall rise,</L>
<L>And with the blooming Sight regale thy Eyes:</L>
<L>Their beauteous Cheeks a fairer Rose shall wear,</L>
<L>A brighter Lilly in their Necks appear:</L>
<L>Thou on their Breasts thy wearied Head recline,</L>
<L>Nor at the Swan's less pleasing Nest repine:</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Philomel</HI> in each soft Voice complains,</L>
<L>And gently lulls thee with her dying Strains:</L>
<L>Whilst spicy Gums round each fair Bosom glow;</L>
<L>And in each Accent myrrhy Odours flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For thee with softest Art the Dome shall rise,</L>
<L>And spiring Turrets glitter thro' the Skies.</L>
<L>For thee the Robe shall glow with purple Rays;</L>
<L>The Side-board sparkle, and gilt Chariot blaze,</L>
<L>In brilliant Mines, be other Hands employ'd.</L>
<L>So the gay Product be by thine enjoy'd.</L>
<L>For thee the Poplar shall her Amber drain:</L>
<L>For thee in clouded Beauty spring the Cane.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="9"/>
To please thy Taste shall <HI>Gallia</HI> prune the Vine:</L>
<L>To swell thy Treasures <HI>India</HI> sink the Mine.</L>
<L>For thee each Nations nicer Stores shall grow,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Wind some lovely Tribute blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Learning shall ne'er molest thy tranquil Reign,</L>
<L>Nor Science puzzle thy inactive Brain:</L>
<L>Sometimes perhaps thy Fancy take her Wing</L>
<L>To grace a Fan, or celebrate a Ring:</L>
<L>Fix various Dyes to suit each varying Mien:</L>
<L>Prescribe where Patches shou'd in Crouds be seen;</L>
<L>Or sigh soft Strains along the vocal Grove,</L>
<L>And tell the Charms, the sweet Effects of Love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or if more specious Ease thy Care shou'd claim,</L>
<L>And thy Breast glow with faint Desire of Fame,</L>
<L>Some trivial Science shall thy Thoughts amuse;</L>
<L>And Learning's Name a solemn Sound diffuse.</L>
<L>To Thee all Nature's shelly Store I'll bring,</L>
<L>To thee the Sparklings on the Insect's Wing.</L>
<L>Pleasure in infant Forms shalt thou descry;</L>
<L>View, in an Ant, or hear her in a Fly;</L>
<L>When near thy Path, as oft as Spring appears,</L>
<L>The sportive Goddess buzzes round thy Ears:</L>
<L>Now in some Pebble's curious Vein is seen,</L>
<L>Or on some Leaf bestows unusual Green.</L>

<L>Then Sleep shall wrap thee in her downy Arms,</L>
<L>And round thy weary'd Head diffuse her Charms;</L>
<L>Lest growing Pride thy peaceful Schemes o'erthrow,</L>
<L>And Thought succeed,—my most destructive Foe.</L>
<L>The watry Nymphs shall tune the tinkling Vales,</L>
<L>And gentle Zephyrs harmonize their Gales:</L>
<L>For thy repose instruct, with Rival Joy,</L>
<L>Their Streams to murmur, and their Winds to sigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus shalt thou spend the sweetly flowing Day,</L>
<L>Till lost in Bliss thou breath thy Soul away:</L>
<L>How easy a Transition should'st thou find,</L>
<L>Were to thy Fate Annihilation join'd!</L>

<L>Tho' no gay Rose, or purple Product shine,</L>

<L>More lasting Pleasure, more substantial Joy.</L>

<L>But shou'd those airy glittr'ing Toys allure,</L>

<L>Or whence receive, or how those Gifts bestow,</L>
<L>Which I alone possess—her greatest Foe?</L>
<L>I from old Ocean rob the treasur'd Store,</L>
<L>And hidden Gems thro' ev'ry Realm explore:</L>
<L>'Twas I the rugged Brilliant first reveal'd,</L>
<L>By tenfold Strata in the Earth conceal'd:</L>
<L>'Tis I the shapeless Surface still refine,</L>

<L>Where smiles the Grape, without fair Industry?</L>

<L>And <HI>Philomela</HI> breath in ev'ry Gale;</L>
<L>Let Brilliants sparkle, (dear Machines of Pride!)</L>
<L>And from the Poplar flow the Amber Tide:</L>
<L>Let gay <HI>Pomona,</HI> quitting all around,</L>
<L>For choicest Fruits select the hallow'd Ground;</L>
<L>To tread the favour'd Soil shou'd <HI>Virtue</HI> cease,</L>

<L>See'st thou those Rocks in dreadful Pomp arise,</L>
<L>And barren Cliffs that sweep the vaulted Skies?</L>
<L>Those Fields whence <HI>Phoebus</HI> all their Moisture drains,</L>
<L>And, too profusely kind, disrobes the Plains?</L>
<L>When I vouchsafe to tread the lonely Soil,</L>
<L>Those Rocks seem lovely, and those Desarts smile;</L>
<L>Oft' on those pathless Wilds as I appear,</L>
<L>(With Converse sweet his lonely Steps to chear)</L>
<L>Those Cliffs the Exile has with Pleasure view'd,</L>
<L>And call'd that Desart, "Blissful Solitude!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Known by its airy Height and tow'ring Spires,</L>
<L>Behind that Scene <HI>Fame's</HI> lofty Dome retires.</L>
<L>Steep the Ascent by which to Fame we rise,</L>
<L>Yet equal to the Labour is the Prize:</L>
<L>From thence you gain an earthly Crown; from thence—you reach the Skies.</L>

<LG>
<L>Far, far below the downy Throne is seen</L>
<L>That lulls to Rest <HI>Ignavia's</HI> softer Queen:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="13"/>
Thence to Fame's Turrets oft' She lifts her Eyes,</L>
<L>Desirous still, still impotent to rise.</L>
<L>Oft', when resolv'd to gain those shining Tow'rs,</L>
<L>The pensive Queen the dire Ascent explores;</L>
<L>Comes onward, wafted by the gummy Trees,</L>
<L>Some Sylvan Musick, or some scented Breeze;</L>
<L>She turns her Head; her own gay Realm she spies,</L>
<L>And all the airy Resolution dies.</L>
</LG>

<L>Thus still in vain these gilded Visions please</L>

<L>Whatever fav'rite Passion reign'd,</L>
<L>The Poet still his Right maintain'd</L>
<L>O'er all that rang'd the Plain:</L>
<L>The siercer Tyrants cou'd asswage,</L>
<L>Or fire the tim'rous into Rage,</L>
<L>Whene'er he chang'd the Strain.</L>

<L>In milder Lays the Bard began;</L>
<L>Soft Notes thro' every Finger ran,</L>
<L>And echoing charm'd the place:</L>
<L>See! fawning Lions gaze around,</L>
<L>And, taught to quit their savage Sound,</L>
<L>Assume a gentler Grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Cymon</HI> view'd the fair One's Charms,</L>

<L>When <HI>Love</HI> reform'd his awkard Tone,</L>
<L>And made each clownish Gesture known,</L>
<L>It shew'd but equal Pow'r.</L>

<L>The Bard now tries a sprightlier sound,</L>
<L>When all the feather'd Race around</L>
<L>Perceive the vary'd Strains;</L>
<L>The soaring Lark the Note pursues;</L>
<L>The tim'rous Dove around him cooes,</L>

<L>Underneath the myrtle Shade,</L>

<L>Round him, in Disorder strewn,</L>

<L>Pleasures, which I seldom share!</L>
<L>Other Deities are blest,</L>
<L>They have each their time of Rest;</L>

From this End o'th World to t'other,</L>

<L>From these Cares to set me free,</L>

</LG>

<L>In fair <HI>Albion</HI> Isle renown'd,</L>
<L>Is a certain Lady found,</L>
<L>Furnish'd well with ev'ry Grace,</L>

<L>Then her Eyes! no Rivals know:</L>
<L>None—but what her Glass can shew.</L>
<L><HI>They</HI> supply the distant Sun,</L>

<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> ne'er approaches nigh,</L>

<L><HI>Phoebus</HI> will not; why shou'd I?</L>
<L>Yet to make her Pow'r divine,</L>
<L>And the more resemble mine,</L>
<L>I'll a share of Darts consign.</L>
<L>She their Business understands,</L>
<L>She shall take it of my Hands—</L>

<L>Here my Muse must change the strain,</L>

<L>Can I wield your filthy Bow?</L>
<L>Can I—O ye odious Boy!</L>
<L>Your rough Implements employ?—</L>
<L>I'm no <HI>Amazon,</HI> nor can</L>

Speak the word, the <HI>wanton</HI> cries,</L>
<L>Hence a Snuff-box shall arise:</L>
<L>Then the Feather, plac'd with Care,</L>
<L>May Demolish—from your Hair:</L>
<L>And the <HI>Sticks</HI>—while Ten is counting—</L>

<LG>
<L>Not Mamma—I needs must tell ye—</L>
<L>Can in guiding these, excell ye;</L>
<L>Which conducted by your Art,</L>

<L>Fear not, tho' Flow'rs and Beauty grace my Lay,</L>
<L>To praise one Fair, <HI>another</HI> shall decay.</L>
<L>No <HI>Lilly,</HI> bright with painted Foliage, here,</L>
<L>Shall only languish, when <HI>Selinda's</HI> near:</L>
<L>A Fate revers'd no smiling <HI>Rose</HI> shall know,</L>
<L>Nor with reflected Lustre doubly glow—</L>
<L>Praises, which languish, when apply'd to You,</L>

<L>Yet sure your <HI>Sex</HI> is near to Flow'rs ally'd,</L>
<L>Alike in Softness, and alike in Pride:</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="74"/>
Foes to retreat, and ever fond to shine,</L>
<L>Both rush to Danger, and the Shades decline;</L>
<L>Expos'd, the short-liv'd Pageants of a Day,</L>
<L>To painted Flies, or glitt'ring Pops a Prey:</L>

<L>Some visionary Fair she cheats our View,</L>

<LG>
<L>Yet Nature some for sprightlier Joys design'd,</L>
<L>For brighter Scenes, with nicer Care, refin'd.</L>
<L>When the gay Jewel radiant Streams supplies,</L>

<L>Tho' roseate Scents in ev'ry Wind exhale,</L>
<L>And silvan Warblers charm in ev'ry Gale.</L>

<L>Of these be HER'S the Choice, whom all approve,</L>

<L>By Nature model'd, by Experience taught,</L>
<L>To know, and pity ev'ry female Fault:</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="77"/>
Pleas'd ev'n to hear her Sex's Virtuews shewn,</L>
<L>And blind to none's Perfections, but her own:</L>
<L>Whilst, humble Fair! of <HI>these</HI> too few she knows,</L>
<L>Yet owns too many for the World's Repose:</L>
<L>From Wit's wild Petulance serenely free,</L>
<L>Yet blest in all that Nature can decree,</L>
<L>Not like a Fire, which, whilst it burns, alarms;</L>
<L>A modest Flame, that gently shines and warms;</L>
<L>Whose Mind, in ev'ry Light, can Charms display,</L>
<L>With Wisdom serious, and with Humour gay;</L>
<L>Just as her Eyes in each bright Posture warm,</L>
<L>And fiercely strike, or languishingly charm:</L>
<L>Such are your Honours—mention'd to your Cost,</L>
<L>Those least can hear them, who deserve them most:</L>
<L>Yet ah! forgive—the less inventive Muse,</L>
<L>If e'er she sing, a copious Theme must chuse.</L>
