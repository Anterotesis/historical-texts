<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Necessity of publishing a new PEERAGE of SCOTLAND, and the Utili∣ty
of it, is acknowledged by all. The Compiler of this present Work
has attempted it upon a more regular and accurate Plan than has hitherto appear∣ed:
How far he has succeeded the World must judge: But if the most assidu∣ous
Application for many Years; if a painful Enquiry into the public Records,
and ancient Chartularies; if an unwearied Search after every Degree of Know∣ledge,
necessary for carrying on so arduous a Task; if these have any Merit, or
deserve the Favour of the Public, the Author flatters himself this Work, on Per∣usal,
will not be found deficient. Neither has he relied solely upon his own
Skill: He acknowledges, with the utmost Gratitude, the Obligations he lies un∣der
to <HI>Walter MacFarlane,</HI> Esq; of that Ilk, for the generous and benevolent
Communication of that Treasury of <HI>Scotch</HI> Antiquities of which he is possessed.
Nor have the Keepers of the public Archives been wanting in contributing all
in their Power to forward the Design.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding all that has been done, there doubtless may, and will be,
Mistakes, such are unavoidable in a Work of this Kind, though the Author hopes
they will not be found numerous, as all Manner of Pains has been taken to avoid
them, as well by the Labour bestowed upon the Compilation, as by putting it
in the Power of every Peer to correct or add to the History of his own Family,
by sending him a Manuscript Copy some Time before Publication, they produc∣ing
sufficient Documents in Support of any Alteration made: And where the
History of any particular Family in this Work varies, either from former Au∣thors,
or from received Family Opinions, Care has been taken to justify the Dif∣ference
of Sentiment, by undoubted Authorities quoted on the Margin.</P>
<P>ANY <HI>Inaccuracies that may be in Point of Language, 'tis hoped the Reader will
overlook.</HI> It must be owned that has not been so much attended to. The chief
and principal Point the Author had in View, and the great Object of his Attention
being, in a plain and distinct Manner, to deduce the History of each Family from
its Origin to the present Generation, and to ascertain their Genealogy and Chro∣nology
by undisputed Documents. This, 'tis hoped, is done, and nothing fur∣ther
is pretended. Such Escapes or Omissions as have been discovered in parti∣cular
Families since they were printed off, are carefully inserted in the Addenda
at the End of the PEERAGE.</P>
<P>IT will probably be observed by our Readers, that certain Chartularies, and
other Vouchers, quoted on the Margin, are said to be <HI>penes MacFarlane,</HI> though
the Originals are actually in the Possession of others; but as that great and inge∣nious
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
Antiquary, in his valuable Collection, has authenticated Copies of all these
Documents, the Author was obliged to quote those Copies when he had not Ac∣cess
to the Originals.</P>
<P>'Tis thought proper here also to inform our Readers, that in engraving the Arms
of the Nobility, as prefixed to this Work, the Order is followed in which they
are ranked in the Roll made up at the Union Parliament in 1706 and 1707,
which has been looked on as an authentic Roll ever since.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged, that, according to our printed Proposals, there should have
been added a short System of Heraldry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but as this Volume has swelled to
a much greater Bulk than was expected, that Treatise must be reserved for the
second Part of this Work, the BARONAGE, or an Account of the GENTRY of <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
and as there are few Peers but have some Descendents who will appear in
the BARONAGE, there will then be a proper Opportunity of publishing any re∣markable
Event that has been omitted here.</P>
<P>THE Addenda, or Alterations since this Work has been put to the Press, the
Author has thrown at the End of this Volume; and, for the greater Ease to the
Reader, has reduced them to alphabetical Order, by which Means any Thing
wanted may easily be found out.</P>
<P>THE Reader is desired to excuse some seeming Inaccuracies that appear in
numbering the Pages of this Work. These were occasioned by the Additions
made to several Families since they were first printed off, whereby the Num∣bers
of many Pages are doubled.</P>

PEERAGE
OF
SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="peerage">
<HEAD>HAMILTON Earl of ABERCORN.</HEAD>
<P>THE first of the illustrious peerage of
Scotland that presents to our readers,
in alphabetical order, is HAMILTON Earl of
ABERCORN, the undoubted heir-male of the
great and noble family of Hamilton; a fami∣ly
who have equally distinguished themselves
in the field and at the council-board, and have
been no less remarkable in the histories of fo∣reign
nations, than in the annals of Scotland.</P>
<P>But as the dignity, estate, and honours of
this house, have descended in the female as
well as in the male succession, for its origin
and antiquity, we refer our readers to the Ti∣tle
<HI>Duke of Hamilton,</HI> and deduce the family of
Abercorn from their immediate predecessor,</P>
<P>X. JAMES, second earl of Arran, and duke
of Chatelherault, the tenth generation of the
family of Hamilton, in a direct male line.
This earl married lady Margaret Douglas,
eldest daughter of James earl of Morton, by
whom he had four sons and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Arran and duke of
Chatelherault, who died without issue.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>john,</HI> who was the first marquis
of Hamilton, and carried on the line of the
family.</P>
<P>3. Lord <HI>Claud,</HI> the first of the family of
Abercorn.</P>
<P>For the other children, and their marri∣ages,
<HI>vide</HI> Title <HI>Duke of Hamilton.</HI></P>
<P>XI. Lord CLAUD HAMILTON, third son
of James earl of Arran and duke of Cha∣telherault,
when very young was appointed
commendator of the abbacy of Paisley, up∣on
the resignation of John archbishop of St.
Andrews, <HI>anno</HI> 1553,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's Peerage of Scotl. Lodge's Peerage of Ire∣land. Scots Compend.&amp;c.</NOTE> which was ratified and
approved by pope Julius III. He was a brave
and gallant gentleman, of steady honour, and
unchangeable integrity; who, by a series of
virtuous actions, reflected lustre on his great
ancestors, and ennobled the illustrious blood
that ran in his veins, During the melancho∣ly
discords that prevailed in Scotland, under
the unhappy reign of queen Mary, he ad∣hered
to her interest in all her misfortunes.
Prompted by his own innate bravery, and
his loyalty to his royal mistress, he appear∣ed
and distinguished himself in the last effort
that was made in her cause at the battle of
Langside, <HI>anno</HI> 1568. In vain he displayed
the skill and courage of a great commander:
the battle was lost, and proved fatal to the
queen's party.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle, lord Claud,
with many others, was summoned to attend
a parliament, called together by the earl of
Murray, then regent, and, upon his refusal,
was outlawed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> and his estate forfeited.</P>
<P>During the regency of the earl of Mar,
his lands were given to the lord Semple,
who kept a strong garrison in his castle, and
exercised all around a severe military disci∣pline,
displaying every violence and oppressi∣on
that power can do, to maintain a precari∣ous
possession. At length this gallant lord,
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
supported by his faithful tenants, rose in arms,
besieged the castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland, page 151, vol. III. M. S. Hist. of the family pe∣nes com. de Abercorn.</NOTE> and obliged lord Semple
to Iurrender at discretion.</P>
<P>During the regency of Morton, lord Claud
was a sharer of the oppressions that bore down
the Hamilton family. He was obliged to fly
to England for safety, not daring to trust the
prevailing faction, though his forfeiture had
been repealed by the act of parliament con∣firming
the pacification of Perth, <HI>anno</HI> 1573.
But when the king took the management of
affairs into his own hands, and reflected on
the different parties that divided the nation,
he soon perceived that the flood of persecuti∣on,
that overwhelmed the Hamiltons, was ow∣ing
to no other cause but their zealous and
steady attachment to his unhappy mother; he
therefore restored them to all their estates and
honours, and heaped many other favours
upon them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. et Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> in particular, he bestowed upon
lord Claud, and his heirs-male, or assigneys,
by charter, all the lordship and barony of
Paisley, with the pertinents belonging to the
abbacy and monastery thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an∣num 1585.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1585.
And, as a further testimony of his esteem and
regard for him, he was pleased, in considera∣tion
of his constant loyalty, great losses and
sufferings, to create him a peer, by the title
of lord Paisley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an∣num 1587.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1587.</P>
<P>His majesty likewise granted, by another
charter, to lord Claud Hamilton, now lord
Paisley, and his heirs-male whatever, the ba∣rony
and regality of the burgh of Paisley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an∣num 1591.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.
anno</HI> 1591.</P>
<P>And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad an∣num 1593.</NOTE> by another charter, the five pound
land of Sanquhar, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1593.</P>
<P>This lord died advanced in age and cha∣racter,
<HI>anno</HI> 1621, having married Margaret
daughter of George lord Scton, by whom
he had four sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards earl of Abercorn.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Cland Hamilton,</HI> who married the
daughter and heiress of sir Robert Hamilton
of Elieston, in the county of Tyrone in Ire∣land,
by whom he had six sons and two daugh∣ters;
of them the Hamiltons of Elicston, Mon∣terlony,
and several other considerable families
in Ireland, are descended. He was gentle∣man
of the bedchamber to the King, and was
made constable and commander of the castle
of Toome in the county of Antrim for life,
<HI>anno</HI> 1618.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE></P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>George Hamilton</HI> of Greenlaw and
Roserea, in the county of Tipperara in Ire∣land,
who behaved with great bravery in
the service of his majesty king Charles I.
He married, Ist, Isabella of the family of Ci∣vicot
of Bruges in Flanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tory of the family penes com. de Aber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn.</NOTE> by whom he had
a daughter, Margaret, married to sir Archi∣bald
Achinson of Gosford: 2dly, Mary,
daughter of Walter earl of Ormond and Osso∣ry,
by whom he had a son James, who died Ibid.
unmarried.</P>
<P>4. Sir <HI>Frederic Hamilton,</HI> a gallant officer,
who acquired great reputation under Gustavus
Adolphus, and was colonel of a regiment
under king Charles I. He married Sidney,
daughter of sir John Vaughan, and was an∣cestor
of the viscount of Boyne in Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and peerage of Ireland.</NOTE></P>
<P>His daughter Margaret was married to
William marquis of Douglas.</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, first son of Claud lord Pais∣ley,
commonly designed master of Paisley,
was a man of eminent parts, and much tak∣en
notice of at court. He was highly esteem∣ed
by the King, who made him one of the
lords of his privy-council, and gentleman
of his bed-chamber, when he was but a
young man; and gave him by a charter, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1600,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad ann. 1600.</NOTE> the office of high-sheriff of the
county of Linlithgow, with all the fees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
thereto belonging, to him and his heirs-male
whatever.</P>
<P>And by another charter in 1601,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. ad ann. 1601.</NOTE> the
lands and manour of Abercorn, Braidmeadows,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The king was afterwards pleased, on ac∣count
of his great merit, to create him ba∣ron
of Abercorn; and, by a new charter, to
erect the lands of the lordship and barony of
Abercorn, the lands of Duddingston, New∣ton
and Duntarvie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into one free barony,
<HI>anno</HI> 1603;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. ad ann. 1063.</NOTE> and in 1606, his majesty fur∣ther
honoured him with the titles of earl of
Abercorn, baron of Paisley, Hamilton, Mount∣castle
and Kilpatrick, by patent to him and
his heirs-male whatever;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's Peerage. Peerage of Ireland. Scot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Compend.</NOTE> and the same year
appointed him one of the commissioners to
treat of an union with England.</P>
<P>He likewise granted him by charter, in
1612, the eight-merk land of Moryhagane,
Keirmouer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad ann. 1612.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was appointed one of the lords of the
privy-council of the kingdom of Ireland, and
was summoned to attend the parliament there
with the precedency of an earl; and had a
large grant of lands in the barony of Stra∣bane,
upon which he built a strong and fair
castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE> and a church.</P>
<P>He married Mariana, daughter of Thomas
lord Boyd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad ann. 1589.</NOTE> by whom he had five sons and
three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Claud Hamilton,</HI> afterwards baron
of Strabane.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>William Hamilton</HI> knight, who was
long resident at Rome from Henrietta Maria
queen-dowager of England; and married
Jane, daughter of sir Alexander Colquhoun
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
of Luss, widow of Alan lord Cathcart, but
died without issue.</P>
<P>4. Sir <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> ancestor of the
present earl of Abercorn.</P>
<P>5. Sir <HI>Alexander Hamilton</HI> knight, who
married Elizabeth of the family of Beding∣field
of Oxburgh, and had a son who settled
in Germany, and was raised by the emperor
Leopold to the rank of a count of the em∣pire,
where his posterity still enjoy large pos∣sessions
and privileges.</P>
<P>1. Daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to Hugh
lord Semple.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to sir Willi∣am
Cuninghame of Caprington.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Lucy,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>The earl died before his father, <HI>anno</HI> 1618,
and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, second earl of Abercorn,
who succeeded also to his grandfather, lord
Paisley, in 1621.</P>
<P>He was in great favour with his majesty
king James VI. who, on account of his own
personal merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE> and the great loyalty and
faithful services of his noble ancestors, was
pleased to advance him to the peerage of the
kingdom of Ireland, where he had a vast e∣state,
by the title of lord Hamilton of Stra∣bane,
18th Oct. 1616. But the patent be∣ing
to his father's heirs-male, and the Irish
estates being provided to his younger bro∣thers,
he, on that account, resigned that ti∣tle
to king Charles I. who immediately con∣ferred
it on his next brother, Claud Hamil∣ton,
with the precedency of the former cre∣ation
by patent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and M. S. history of the family.</NOTE> bearing date 14th August
1634.</P>
<P>He married Catharine, daughter and sole
heiress of Gervais Clifton of Leighton Broom∣swold,
widow of Esme Stewart duke of Len∣nox
and Richmond, by whom he had three
sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> lord Paisley, who died before
him, having married a daughter of William
Lenthall of Burford in the county of Oxford,
Esq; speaker of the house of commons in
the long parliament, by whom he had an on∣ly
daughter, Catharine, married, 1st, to her
cousin, William Lenthall, Esq; to whom she
had two sons: and, 2dly, to her cousin,
Charles earl of Abercorn; of whom here∣after.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> was colonel of a regiment,
and killed in the wars in Germany, without
issue.</P>
<P>3. <HI>George,</HI> who succeeded to his father's
estate and honours, and was third carl of A∣bercorn;
but dying unmarried at Padua in his
fourney to Rome, in him the male-line of the
eldest son of James first earl of Abercorn be∣came
extinct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE> we therefore return to</P>
<P>XIII. CLAUD, second son of James first earl
of Abercorn, dignified, as already observed,
with the title of lord Hamilton of Strabane,
by a charter under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad ann. 1631.</NOTE> <HI>Claudo
Hamilton Domino de Strabane, &amp;c.</HI> married
lady Jean Gordon, daughter of George mar∣quis
of Huntley, by whom he had two sons
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> lord Strabane.</P>
<P>2. <HI>George,</HI> who succeeded his brother.</P>
<P>1. Daughter, <HI>Catharine,</HI> married, Ist, to
James, eldest son of sir Frederick Hamilton,
fourth son of Claud, first lord Paisley: 2dly,
to Owen Wynne of Lurganbuy, Esq; and
3dly, to John Bingham of Castlebar, Esq;</P>
<P>2. <HI>Mariana,</HI> married to Richard Perkins
of Lifford, Esq;</P>
<P>Claud died <HI>anno</HI> 1638, and was succeed∣ed
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIV. JAMES, third lord Strabane, who,
from his loyalty and steady adherence to the
interest of his masters king Charles I. and
II. suffered many hardships and variety of
losses.</P>
<P>He was unhappily drowned as he was bath∣ing
himself in the river Maine, <HI>anno 1655;</HI>
and having no issue, was succeeded by his
brother,</P>
<P>XIV. GEORGE, fourth lord Strabane, who
married Elizabeth, daughter, and at length sole
heiress, of Christopher Fagen of Filtrim, Esq;
by whom he had two sons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland, and M. S. history of the family.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. <HI>Claud,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> who succeeded his brother.</P>
<P>1. Daughter, <HI>Anne,</HI> married to John Broun
of Neale, Esq;</P>
<P>2. <HI>Mary,</HI> married to Gerard Dillon, esq;
prime serjeant at law to king James VII.</P>
<P>And dying <HI>anno</HI> 1668, was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. CLAUD, fifth lord Strabane, and
fourth earl of Abercorn, who succeeded as
heir-male to George third earl, as remark∣ed
above.</P>
<P>He followed the fortune of king James
VII. at the revolution in 1688, attended
that prince in his expedition to Ireland, where
he was sworn one of his privy-council, and
had a considerable command in his army; in
consequence of which he was attainted of
high treason, and his title of lord Hamilton
of Strabane forseited, by the parliament of
that kingdom, after king James had retired
into France; and, dying unmarried in 1690,
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
he was succeeded in all his Scotch honours
and titles by his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland, and M. S. history of the family.</NOTE></P>
<P>XV. CHARLES, fifth earl of Abercorn,
who got his brother's attainder reversed in
1692, and was restored to his estate and ho∣nours
of lord Hamilton of Strabane in Ire∣land,
which he enjoyed till the general re∣sumption
of grants was made by the English
sumption of grants was made by the English
parliament.</P>
<P>He married, as already observed, Catha∣rine,
only daughter of James lord Paisley,
eldest son of James second earl of Abercorn,
and widow of William Lenthall of Burford,
Esq; by whom he had only one child, who
died an infant before himself. And he dy∣ing
in 1701, without issue, the male line of
the second son of the first earl of Abercorn
failed, whereby the title of lord Hamilton
of Strabane became extinct; and the third
son of the first earl dying without issue, as
before observed, the estate and honours of
Abercorn devolved upon the next heir-male,
descended of the fourth son of the said-first
earl, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XIII. Sir GEORGE HAMILTON, fourth
son of James first earl of Abercorn, was a
man of steady loyalty, great gallantry, and
invariably attached to the interest both of
king Charles I. and II. During the civil
war, he exerted himself with extraordinary
courage in the royal cause, under the directi∣on
of his brother-in-law the marquis, after∣wards
duke of Ormond; and, after living
several years in exile, during the usurpation
of Oliver Cromwel, he returned at the resto∣ration
of king Charles II. who immediately
created him a baronet.</P>
<P>He married Mary, daughter of Thomas
viscount Thurles, eldest son of Walter earl
of Ormond, and sister of the first duke, by
whom he had six sons and three daughters.</P>
<P>1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>George,</HI> who was a count and ma∣jor-general
in France, and was killed at the
battle of Saverne, having married Frances,
daughter and co-heiress of Richard Fennings
of Sandbridge in the county of Hereford,
Esq; maid of honour to Anne, duchess of
York, by whom he had three daughters, all
nobly married, <HI>viz.</HI> Elizabeth, to Richard
viscount Ross; Frances, to Henry viscount
Dillon; Mary, to Nicholas viscount Kings∣land.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who went to France with king
James VII. and was there raised to the rank
of a lieutenant-general. He is said to be au∣thor
of some French pieces that bear the name
of count Hamilton.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Thomas,</HI> who was captain of a ship of
war.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Richard,</HI> who followed king James VII.
to France, where he rose to the rank of a lieu∣tenant-general.</P>
<P>6. <HI>John,</HI> who was killed in the king's ser∣vice
at the battle of Aghrim.</P>
<P>1. Daughter, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to Phil∣bert
count of Gramont, brother to Anthony
duke of Gramont in France.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Lucia,</HI> married to Sir Donald O'Brian
of Leminegh, Bart.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Matthew Ford
of Coolgreny, Esq;</P>
<P>XIV. JAMES HAMILTON, eldest son and
apparent heir of Sir George, was a great fa∣vourite
of king Charles II. whom he attend∣ed
during his exile, and was one of the gen∣tlemen
of his bed-chamber, and colonel of a
regiment; but going a volunteer aboard the
fleet, under the command of James, then

<P>I. PATRICK GORDON of Methlic, liv∣ed
in the reign of king James I. and made
a great figure in Scotland in the beginning
of the reign of king James II. to whom he
was a firm and steady friend.</P>

having acquitted himself with honour and re∣putation

<P>THE family of Abernethy is of great an∣tiquiry,
and made a considerable figure
in Scotland before sirnames were used. And
tho' 'tis evident there was no peerage in the
family, till Laurence Abernethy of Salton was
created a lord of parliament by king James II.
yet, in compliance with the example of our
historians, who have always looked upon them
in this rank, on account of the considerable
place they held amongst the great barons, we
have here inserted them in the first part of
this work, and have followed the same ex∣ample
in some other families, which the can∣did
reader will easily discover.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of some antiquaries, that
the Abernethies are of Pictish extraction, and
that Alan, or Alexander, one of their ance∣sters,
was a man of the first rank in the reign
of king Malcolm Canmore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 446.

daughter of Walter first lord high steward of
Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as this is only tradition,
we proceed to deduce their descent by incon∣testable
documents, from</P>
<P>1. HUGH, who flourished in the reign of
king David I. son of king Malcolm Canmore,
who succeeded to the crown of Scotland, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1124, and died in 1153.</P>
<P>This Hugh is particularly mentioned in se∣veral
charters and confirmations of William
the Lion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Douglas.</NOTE> still preserved. He was father of</P>
<P>II. ORME, a man of considerable distincti∣on
in the reigns of Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olm IV. and William
the Lion, who succeeded him, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He was in possession of the lands of Dun∣loppin
in the reign of king Malcolm, which
appears from a confirmation of these lands to
his son Laurence, by king Alexander III. here∣after
mentioned. He had also at that time the
lands of Balbrennin; for we find him, in the
next reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> excambing them, with earl Dun∣can,
for the lands of Glenduogyn and Balma∣dethyn.</P>
<P>This Orme is witness in a charter of king
Malcolm's,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St. Andrews, penes Mac∣Farlane.</NOTE> with Arnsold bishop of St. An∣drews,
in or before the year 1162; in which
year that bishop died.</P>
<P>He obtained from king William a grant of
the lands of Abernethyn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in Strathearn, <Q REND="inline">"to
him and his heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> from which his
son and successors assumed their sirnames.</P>
<P>He got also a charter of confirmation from
the same prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. pence fam de Douglas.</NOTE> of the lands of Glenduogyn
and Balmadethyn, which he received from
Duncan earl of Fife, in exchange for Balbren∣nin,
<Q REND="inline">"to and in favours of Orme the son of

Caithness, Nichol chancellor of Scotland, Ri∣chard
de Morvile constable, David Oli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard
justiciar, are witnesses, in or before the year
1185, in which year the bishop died.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P><HI>Laurence,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter, mar∣ried
to Henry Rule of Balmerino,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simson's es∣say on the fa∣mily of Dou∣glas.</NOTE> with whom
he got a ten merk land of old extent; a merk
then being one third of a pound weight of
silver. He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>III. LAURENCE, lord Abernethy, who
made a donation of the patronage of the church
of Abernethy to the monastery of Arbroath;
and legated to the canons regular of St. An∣drews
ten shillings yearly, payable out of his
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
lands of Bambreich, and that with consent of
sir Patrick Abernethy his son and heir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartularv of St. Andrews.</NOTE> whose
seal is also appended to the said donation.</P>
<P>He got a charter of the lands of Dunlop∣pin
from king Alexander II. <Q REND="inline">"to Laurence
son of Orme, son of Hugh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> and bears,
that it was conformable to a charter of king
Malcolm, and confirmation of king William,
to his father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes fam. de Douglas.</NOTE> in these words: <HI>Sicut charta

<P>He also got a charter of confirmation of

from the same prince; to which William earl

between king Alexander II of Scotland, and
king Henry III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae, tom. I. p. 428.</NOTE> of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1244; and

<P>His daughter, <HI>Margaret,</HI> was married to
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="marg">Contract penes fam. de Douglas.</NOTE> Hugh, son and heir to William lord Dou∣glas,
eldest brother to William the Hardy, in
1259; but by him she had no issue.</P>
<P>He died before the year 1257, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>V. HUGH lord Abernethy, who, together
with the earls of Menteith, Mar, Athol, and
Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han, surprized king Alexander III. at Kin∣ross,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 91.</NOTE>
and carried him captive to Stirling castle,
<HI>anno</HI> 1257.</P>
<P>He was a party contracter for his sister
Margaret with Hugh de Douglas, and gave
with her in frank marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes fam. de Douglas.</NOTE> a twenty merk
land, either in his village of Glencorse, or his
fen of Chamberlain-Newton. The contract
is dated <HI>anno</HI> 1259, as before observed.</P>
<P>He made several donations to the monaste∣ry
of Coupar in Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Cupar.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1268 and 1269;
and was witness to a confirmation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Coldstream, penea Mac∣Farlane.</NOTE> by king
Alexander III. of a donation to the monaste∣ry
of Coldstream, <HI>anno</HI> 1270.</P>
<P>He married Mary, an English lady, for
whom he obtained a safe conduct from the
king of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 727.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1269. By her he had
a son and successor,</P>
<P>VI. ALEXANDER lord Abernethy, who,
with the rest of the nobility of Scotland,
swore fealty to king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 571.</NOTE> of England,
<HI>anno</HI> 1292.</P>
<P>He made a great figure in the reign of
king Robert Bruce, though he was sometimes
on the Baliol's side, and often in the English
interest against his country; which, it is
thought, he was chiefly induced to by his
connections in England with his mother's
friends. And certain it is, he was in great
favour with king Edward II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. tom. III. p. 211.</NOTE> who appointed
him governor on this side of the Forth, and
the mountains of Scotland, and captain-gene∣ral
of all his subjects fit to bear arms in those
parts. This deed bears date 15th of June
1310.</P>
<P>He, together with David de Strabogie earl
of Athole, and sir Adam Gordon, were named
plenipotentiaries by king Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 300. Abercromby, vol. I. p. 591.</NOTE> then at
York, to treat of a peace with king Robert
Bruce, <HI>anno</HI> 1312.</P>
<P>He left issue three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John Stewart
earl of Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes fam. de Douglas. et chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> who got with her the barony
of Abernethy, the superiority whereof is still
possessed by the family of Douglas, as repre∣sentatives
of the earl of Angus.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Helen,</HI> married to David de Lindsay,
ancestor of the earls of Crawfurd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and father Hay's collections.</NOTE> with whom
he got the barony of Downie in the shire of

the lands and barony of Bambreich, in Fife,
which was long in that family's possession.</P>
<P>We shall only here observe, that these three
noble families, in consequence of the marri∣ages
above mentioned, have ever since con∣tinued
to quarter the arms of Abernethy with
their own.</P>
<P>Alexander lord Abernethy dying without
sons, in him ended the male line of Hugh,

<P>THIS noble family, remarkable for ma∣ny
instances of loyalty to their sove∣reigns,
and attachment to the interest of their

<P>GILBERT, second son of Gilibred, and
brother of Gileh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist earl of Angus, a man of
high distinction, in the reign of king William

<P>He is a frequent witness in his brother earl
Gilchrist's charters to the abbacy of Arbroath,
particularly to one granted by him to that
convent, of the church of Monyfod (now
Moniseith.) The charter is without date;
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
but as John bishop of Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Arbroath, penes Mac∣Farlane, p. 124.</NOTE> is also a wit∣ness,
it must have been granted in or before
the 1207, in which year that bishop died.</P>
<P>1. This GILBERT assumed his sirname
from his lands and barony of Ogilvie, as was
the custom of those early times; and from
him we proceed, by indisputable evidence, to
deduce the descent of this noble family.</P>
<P>He had a son,</P>
<P>II. ALEXANDER de OGILVIE, who suc∣ceeded
him, and was one of the inquest who

<HEAD>STUART Duke of ALBANY.</HEAD>
<P>ROBERT STUART, third son of king
Robert II. by Elizabeth More, was
the first who enjoyed this title. He was
first earl of Menteith, which title he got by
his marriage, and afterwards earl of Fife, by
the resignation of the countess thereof.</P>
<P>He was a man of high accomplishments,
equally qualified to shine in the arts of peace,
or in the troubles of war; for which reason
the king, his father, being infirm with age,
made him governor of Scotland in his own
lifetime; and his brother, king Robert III.
after his accession to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and several Scotch writers.</NOTE> being like∣wise
valetudinary, thought fit to continue
him in the regency, and dignified him with
the title of duke of Albany, <HI>anno</HI> 1399.</P>
<P>Upon the death of king Robert III. his
son king James I. being prisoner in England,
the duke of Albany of right became gover∣nor
of the kingdom for his nephew; in which
office he continued till his death.</P>
<P>He commanded the Scotch army in seve∣ral
engagements against the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and Stuart's hist. of the family of Stuart.</NOTE> and al∣ways
behaved with such courage and conduct,
that he generally came off victorious, though
inferior in numbers to the enemy. And as
he had discharged his trust, in all the high
offices he enjoyed, with great wisdom, pru∣dence
and integrity, his death, which hap∣pened
in 1420, was universally lamented.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Margaret, grandchild and
sole heiress of Alan earl of Menteith, with
whom he got the estate and honours: he had
by her one son,</P>
<P><HI>Murdoch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stuart's hist. of the Stuarts.</NOTE> his heir,—and five daughters.</P>

<P>MURDOCH, first son of Robert duke of
Albany, succeeded to his father's estate and
honours, and also to the government of the
kingdom; but he did not inherit all his fa∣ther's
good qualities. However he was both
active and very instrumental in bringing home
king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which was happily accomplish∣ed
in 1424, and, as earl of Fife, he placed the
king in his chair of state at his coronation in
Scoon.</P>
<P>But as the duke became too great for a
subject, he was suspected to have a design
upon the crown; and being discovered to be
engaged in some secret plots and transactions,
(the nature of them all our historians are si∣lent
about,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun. lib. 14. cap. 10▪ Abercromby, Crawfurd, &amp;c.</NOTE> probably being very criminal
and treasonable) he was, with two of his
sons, tried, condemned and executed, and
his estate and honours forfeited to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1425.</P>
<P>He married Isabel, daughter and heiress of
Duncan earl of Lennox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stuart's hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> by whom he had

he had seven sons, three whereof were
legitimated by king James III. of whom several
considerable families are descended; particu∣larly
the families of Evandale and Ochiltree.</P>

<P>The next who enjoyed this high title, was
ALEXANDER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> second son of king James II.
who was created duke of Albany in 1452.
But having been engaged in a most unnatural
rebellion against his brother king James III.
his wicked practices were discovered; his
measures broke; and he himself obliged to
retire to France, where he ended his days.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Catharine, daughter
of William earl of Orkney and Caithness, it
seems, uncanonically; for they were after∣wards
divorced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad an∣num 1477.</NOTE> upon account of propinquity
of blood; but by her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> who was bishop of Murray.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, a daughter of the earl
of Boulogne, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> duke of Albany, who was a wise,
brave, and virtuous prince. He was nine years
governor of Scotland in the minority of king
JamesV. and behaved in that high office with
great fidelity and prudence.</P>
<P>By act of parliament he was declared next
heir to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story of the royal family.</NOTE> failing issue of king James
V. But upon some discontent happening a∣mong
the nobility, he laid down his office,
and retired to France, where he died <HI>anno</HI>
1536, having married Anna de la Tour of
the family of Vendosme, by whom he had
no issue: so that the title of Albany lay ex∣tinct,
until Mary queen of Scotland bestowed
it on Henry lord Darnley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> son of Matthew
earl of Lennox and lady Margaret Douglas,
daughter of Archibald earl of Angus by queen
Margaret, daughter of king Henry VII. sister
of king Henry VIII. of England, and widow
of king James IV. of Scotland, and grand-aunt
to her majesty queen Mary.</P>
<P>This Henry lord Darnley and Man, creat∣ed
duke of Albany and earl of Rose by queen
Mary of Scotland, she afterwards took to be
her husband; and he, with his royal consort,
were proclaimed king and queen of Scotland,
<HI>&amp;. c.</HI></P>
<P>The title of Albany was thus again vested
in the crown, and continued in it till king
Charles I. conferred it on his son prince
Charles, <HI>anno</HI> 1601; and he (who was after∣wards
king Charles II.) bestowed that title
on his brother the duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1660,
which he always kept till he became king of
Great-Britain himself, <HI>anno</HI> 1685.</P>

<HEAD>KER Earl of ANCRUM.</HEAD>
<P>THE first person who was dignified with
this title,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes Thom. Dun∣das de Fin∣gask.</NOTE> was sir ROBERT KER, eldest
son of William Ker of Ancrum, by Margaret
his spouse, daughter of Alexander Dundas of
Fingask, ancestor of the present Thomas Dun∣das
of Fingask, Esq; and sir Laurence Dun∣das,
Bart.</P>
<P>This sir Robert was a man of fine parts,
and deservedly a favourite at court, being
made gentleman of the bed-chamber to king
James VI. and continued in the same office
under king Charles I. both which princes he
served with distinguished honour and fidelity.</P>
<P>At length, in reward of his merit, he was
created earl of Ancrum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by letters patent,
bearing date 24th June, 1633.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Elizabeth, daughter of
sir John Murray of Blackbarony, by whom
he had a son, sir <HI>William Ker,</HI> who became earl
of Lothian, on his marriage with Anne countess
and heiress thereof.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Engl. vol. II. p. 83.</NOTE> lady Anne Stanley, eldest
daughter of William earl of Derby, by whom
he had a son, <HI>Charles,</HI> his successor in this title.</P>
<P>CHARLES, second earl of Ancrum, suc∣ceeded
his father, in virtue of the special li∣mitation
of the patent, to the heirs-male of
earl Robert's second marriage with lady Anne
Stanley; and dying without issue, the title
devolved upon the family of Lothian, descend∣ed
of sir William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Report of the lords of session to the house of peers in 1739.</NOTE> the son of earl Robert's
first marriage, as the patent settled it on the

was created earl of Angus by that

<P>II. GILIBREDE, second earl of Angus,
who succeeded him, and is mentioned by
many of our historians as a great warrior. He
lived in the reigns of king David I. king Mal∣colm
IV. and king William the Lion.</P>
<P>He was one of the chief commanders of
the Scotch army (tho' then but a young man)

they invaded England in king Stephen's reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, vol. II. p. 162.</NOTE>

Earl Gilebrede died about the year 1180,

<P>III. GILCHRIST, third earl of Angus,
who was one of the greatest men of his time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan, Lesly, &amp;c.</NOTE>
and performed many glorious exploits in king
William's wars.</P>
<P>When the king was a prisoner, the Eng∣lish
invaded Cumberland, of which they ima∣gined
to have made an easy conquest; but
the brave Gilchrist, who had the chief com∣mand
of the Scotch forces, gave them such
a warm reception,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 260.</NOTE> that they were obliged to
agree to a truce, whereby Cumberland and
Huntington remained in the hands of the
Scots.</P>
<P>Soon after this he quelled a most dange∣rous
insurrection in Galloway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE> which was of
more service to his king and country, than
many of his other great actions.</P>
<P>He had the honour to be married to the
king's sister, which his merit and great ser∣vices
highly deserved; but was unhappily led
into a suspicion of her having dishonoured his
bed, which fatally prompted him to put an
end to her life, whereupon he was obliged
to abscond. He was condemned in absence,
his houses demolished, and his estate forfeited.</P>
<P>He wandered long in his own country in
the utmost misery and want; till at last he
was accidentally met (in the habit of a pea∣sant)
by the king on the high road to Perth.
The king observing something more in his
air and mien,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. p. 268, and Boethius in vita regis Gulielmi.</NOTE> than his dress denoted, spoke
to him, and desired to know who he was.
The old general falling on his knees, begged
forgiveness; and gave such a lively account
of his misfortunes and sufferings, that the
king was greatly moved therewith, and not
only restored him to his honours and estate,
but to the same degree of favour he had for∣merly
enjoyed.</P>
<P>He made a donation to the abbacy of

<HEAD>UMFRAVILLE Earl of ANGUS.</HEAD>
<P>I. SIR ROBERT UMFRAVILLE, lord of
Tours and Vian in Normandy, a near
kinsman of William the conqueror, came o∣ver
to England with that great prince, <HI>anno</HI>
1066, and had a considerable command in
his army; and as William divided his con∣quered
lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the extinct peer∣ages of Eng∣land, penes Macfarlane, v. II. p. 111.</NOTE> and rewarded his officers ac∣cording
to their merit, so he bestowed upon
sir Robert, the valley, forest, and lordship
of Riddisdale, in the county of Northumber∣land.</P>
<P>He lived after the year 1100, and left a
son,</P>
<P>II. ROBERT de UMFRAVILLE, who is
often mentioned in the annals of king Henry
I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of England.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>III. GILBERT de UMFRAVILLE, who
came to Scotland in the reign of king Da∣vid
I. with whom he had contracted a friend∣ship
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
while he resided in England; and as he
was in great favour with him, he shared of
his bounty, and got from him several lands
in the shire of Stirling, which appears from
the donations to the abbacy of Cambusken∣neth.
It is therefore certain he settled in
Scotland, and survived that good prince eight
or ten years.</P>
<P>He was witness in several charters of king
Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of St. Andrews, penes Mac∣farlane, and Chartul. of Paisly, penes eundem.</NOTE> betwixt the years 1154 and
1162; and dying before 1165, was succeed∣ed
by his son,</P>
<P>IV. GILBERT de UMFRAVILLE, who
appears to have had considerable possessions
in Scotland, where he chiefly resided, though
he also had a great estate in England.</P>
<P>He made a donation to the abbacy of Ho∣lyroodhouse
of a carucate of land in Kinnaird
in Stirling-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of ori∣ginal writs, penes Mac∣farlane.</NOTE> about the year 1187, <HI>pro sa∣lute

<P>He left a son and successor,</P>
<P>V. RICHARD de UMFRAVILLE, who
having great interest in England, was pre∣vailed
upon to join the barons against king
John, <HI>anno</HI> 1201; for which his lands in
England were forfeited, and given to Hugh
de Baliol:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the extinct peers of England.</NOTE> but king Henry III. restored him
to his castle of Pruden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He also appears to have resided more in
Scotland than in England, and was succeed∣ed
by his son,</P>
<P>VI. GILBERT de UMFRAVILLE, who
was in great favour with king Alexander III.
whom he accompanied to York, where they
met king Henry of England, and concluded
the marriage betwixt his daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> princess
Margaret, and king Alexander, <HI>anno</HI> 1252.</P>
<P>A good historian says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Matt. Paris.</NOTE> that this Gilbert de
Umfraville was a famous baron, guardian, and
chief slower of the North, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1262, and left issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. GILBERT de UMFRAVILLE, who
succeeded him, and was one of the greatest
men of his time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the extinct peers of England, &amp;c.</NOTE> He joined the barons of
England against king Henry III. but was af∣terwards
reconciled to that prince.</P>
<P>He married Matilda, countess of Angus, in
whose right he became earl of Angus, as be∣fore
noticed, by which he got a vast acces∣sion
to his estate and interest in Scotland.</P>
<P>He was one of the <HI>magnates Scotiae,</HI> that
negotiated the marriage between king Alex∣ander's
daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 1082.</NOTE> princess Margaret, and E∣ric
king of Norway, <HI>anno</HI> 1281.</P>
<P>In 1284 he was one of the Scotch nobles
that obliged themselves to maintain and sup∣port
queen Margaret's title to the crown, af∣ter
the death of her grandfather king Alex∣ander
III.</P>
<P>By the said countess of Angus he left issue
two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Gilbert.</HI></P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Ingelram,</HI> who, being a man of great
parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, v. II. p. 153.</NOTE> was sent ambassador to France by king
John Baliol, <HI>anno</HI> 1284. He was also one
of the Scotch nobles who signed that famous
letter to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 275.</NOTE> asserting the independen∣cy
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1320. But we can
give no account of his posterity.</P>
<P>The earl dying <HI>anno</HI> 1285, was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VIII. GILBERT, second earl of Angus of
the name of Umfraville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 471.</NOTE> who was one of the
great barons that agreed to the marriage of
queen Margaret of Scotland with prince Ed∣ward
of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>He was also one of the commissioners chos∣en
by John Baliol to support his interest a∣gainst
Robert Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 553.</NOTE> in the competition for
the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1292.</P>
<P>After king Robert Bruce began to assert
his title to the crown, the earl still continu∣ed
firm to the Baliol's interest, and having a
great estate in England, he turned a most
implacable enemy to Scotland.</P>
<P>As soon as king Robert had attained the
crown, he endeavoured to reclaim the earl
of Angus, and bring him over to his party,
but all to no purpose, the earl being intirely
devoted to the English interest; for which
king Robert deprived him of his estate and
honours in Scotland, and annexed them to
the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1307, where they remain∣ed,
till king David bestowed them upon sir
John Stuart of Bonkill, <HI>anno</HI> 1330, as will
be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>This earl had been long in great favour
with king Edward I. and was called by him
to the parliament as a baron of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the extinct peer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of England, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1295; and he and his posterity, as long as
the family subsisted, continued to sit in the
English parliament, though they still retain∣ed
the title of earls of Angus.</P>
<P>He did not long survive his forfeiture; but
dying <HI>anno</HI> 1307,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> was succeeded in his great
estate in England by his son,</P>

<P>THE Johnstons were a bold and hardy

<P>They began to make a figure in Scotland
in the reign of king Alexander II. who suc∣ceeded

they became numerous, and were pos∣sessed
of considerable estates in many different

<P>There were two families of this sirname,

is a crescent and a star, which, with very
little variation, is at this day the arms of the

<P>He died about the end of the thirteenth
century, and was buried amongst his ancestors

<P>THAT the noble and illustrious name of

the reign of king Malcolm Canmore."</Q></P>
<P>In the traditional accounts of our bards
and senachies, it is said, that their predeces∣sors

that the first appellation they used, was O-Dubhin,
which, according to an early custom,
they assumed from Diarmed O-Dubhin, one
of their ancestors, who was a brave and war∣like
man; and from him, in the Galic lan∣guage,
they are called Siol Diarmed; that is,
the posterity and offspring of Diarmed.</P>
<P>The bards have recorded a long series of
the barons of Lochow, descended of the fore∣said
Diarmed O-Dubhin, who were renown∣ed
both for courage and conduct: amongst
whom was Paul O-Dubhin, lord of Lochow,
who was denominated Paul Inspuran, from
his being the king's treasurer. But he hav∣ing
no male issue, his estate went to his daugh∣ter
Eva, who being married to Gillespick O-Dubhin,
a relation of her own, he got their
name changed to Campbell, to perpetuate the
memory of a noble and heroic action perform∣med
by him for the crown of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in the

XVII. ARCHIBALD, fourth earl of Ar∣gyle,
who was one of the noble Scotch peers,
that strenuously opposed the match betwixt
Mary queen of Scotland, and king Edward
VI. of England; believing, that an union be∣twixt
the kingdoms must necessarily ensue,
which could not but be derogatory to the ho∣nour
of his country: Upon which a war
breaking out with England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb. hist. of the campaigns, 1548 &amp; 1549.</NOTE> he greatly di∣stinguished
himself by his valour and conduct
both at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, and at
the siege of Haddington in 1548.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. inter 1545 &amp; 1555.</NOTE></P>
<P>He got charters, from queen Mary, <HI>Ar∣chibaldo

<P>XVIII. ARCHIBALD, fifth earl of Argyle,
who was a man of singular accomplishments,
and a great promoter of the reformation of
religion.</P>
<P>In 1559, he went over to France, to sup∣plicate
Queen Mary's favour to the Prote∣stant
religion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biograph.</NOTE> and immediately upon his re∣turn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Britannica.</NOTE>

thereof, which at last they got
established by act of Parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1560.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he espoused the interest of queen Mary hear∣tily
and sincerely, and was general of her
forces at the battle of Langside, and though
the queen's troops were entirely routed, yet
he still persisted in his loyalty and fidelity to
her majesty, of which she was so much con∣vinced,
that after she was prisoner in Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. XV. p. 687. ad ann. 1570.</NOTE>
she nominated the duke of Chattlerault,
the earls of Argyle and Huntly her lieute∣nants
throughout the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>The earl concurred and greatly promoted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
every measure that was proposed for the reco∣very
of her majesty's liberty, but when all their
endeavours proved fruitless, he at last sub∣mitted
to the authority of king James VI. and
was immediately admitted one of the lords of
the privy-council, <HI>anno</HI> 1571.</P>
<P>He was also appointed justice general, keep∣er
of the great seal, and lord high chancellor

<P>His son James, who, was a man of great
valour and courage, was by king James VI.
created lord Kintyre, <HI>anno</HI> 1622, and having
served Lewis XIII. in his wars against the
Spaniards, where he had the command of a
regiment, he acquitted himself with such ho∣nour
and reputation, that upon his return
home, king Charles I. was pleased to raise
him to the dignity of earl of Irvine in 1642;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creations of the nobility.</NOTE>
but he dying without heirs-male, the honours
became extinct.</P>

succeeded by his eldest son.</P>
<P>XX. ARCHIBALD, eighth earl, afterwards
marquis of Argyle, who was a man of great
learning and singular endowments.</P>
<P>He was one of the privy-council to king
Charles I. into whose hand he resigned the jus∣ticiary
of all Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1628, which had
been in his family for several ages, reserving
to himself and his heirs the jurisdiction of the
western isles and Argyle, and wherever else he
had lands in Scotland, all which was ratisied
by act of parliament past in his majesty's pre∣sence,
<HI>anno</HI> 1633. And in respect of his own
merit, as well as the remarkable loyalty of his
ancestors, his majesty was pleased to create
him marquis of Argyle by letters patent, dat∣ed
in November 1641.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. regist.</NOTE></P>
<P>He afterwards got two charters under the
great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. ad ann. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>Archibaldo marchioni de Argyle, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When king Charles's troubles begun, he join∣ed
the parliament of Scotland, and was a zeal∣ous
asserter of the Presbyterian church-govern∣ment;
but after the horrid murder of the king,
he contributed much to the reception and
coronation of king Charles II. on the 1st of
January 1650, and had the honour to put the
crown on the king's head at Scoon. But hav∣ing
afterwards joined and sided with Oliver
Cromwell (a common fault in those times) he
was soon after the restoration convicted of high
treason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of the marquis of Argyle. Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> condemned by the parliament, and
beheaded at Edinburgh on the 27th of May
1661, and his estate and honours forfeited to
the crown.</P>
<P>He was a consummate statesman, and one of
the ablest politicians of his time. When he
was going to death, he declared his abhor∣rence
of the murder of king Charles I.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Douglas, daugh∣ter
of William earl of Morton, by whom he
had two sons and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Archibald,</HI> afterwards earl of Argyle.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>Neil Campbell</HI> of Armadie, who
was twice married, and had issue Dr. Archi∣bald
Campbell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>1. Daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to Robert marquis
of Lothian.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married, 1st, to George
earl of Caithness: and, 2dly, to John earl of
Breadalbine.</P>
<P>XXI. ARCHIBALD, lord Lorn, eldest son
of the marquis, adhered firmly to the king's
interest, during all the time of the usurpati∣on,
and was captain of his majesty's foot∣guards,
<HI>anno</HI> 1650. He continued to serve
the king with great steadiness and fidelity, and
signalized himself upon several occasions a∣gainst
the parliament's forces; which so in∣censed
Oliver Cromwell against him, that in
April 1654,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel's act of indem∣nity.</NOTE> when he granted a general in∣demnity
to the Scots, this lord, with some
other loyalists, were particularly excepted,
and he was made prisoner.</P>
<P>During his confinement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biographia Britannica. p. 1156.</NOTE> he had his skull
accidentally fractured, for which he was o∣bliged
to be trepaned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding all his sufferings, he never
could be prevailed upon to submit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawsurd's peerage, and state tracts.</NOTE> or come
to any composition with Cromwell, till he got
his majesty's permission by general Middleton
so to do, which was dated 31st December
1655. He then returned to his own house,
where he lived privately and quietly, still per∣sisting
in his integrity and loyalty, till king
Charles II. was happily restored, <HI>anno</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>His majesty being perfectly satisfied of this
lord's good behaviour, was graciously pleased
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
to restore him to his father's estate, and the
honours and precedency of the ancient earls
of Argyle:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in archiv. Caro∣li II. &amp;c.</NOTE> The onerous cause in the pa∣tent
(which is dated in 1663) being for his
eminent loyalty and zeal for the restoration,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he was the ninth earl of Argyle.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter he was made one of
his majesty's privy-council, and a commissio∣ner
of the treasury; which offices he discharg∣ed
with great sidelity; but as he was a stre∣nuous
asserter and firm friend to the Prote∣stant
religion, and Presbyterian church go∣vernment,
he thereby had some considerable
enemies at court.</P>
<P>About the year 1680, the test act passed,
whereby all ranks of people were enjoined,
by act of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Test act in the records.</NOTE> to defend the govern∣ment
in church and state, as presently esta∣blished,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the pains of treason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and this act went very ill down with a great
many well-meaning men, particularly with
this noble earl, who, having a tender and
scrupulous conscience, could not comply with
it in these terms, but offered to take it with his
own explanation, part whereof was in these
words:</P>
<P><Q>"I take it, in so far as it is consistent with
itself, and the protestant religion; and I
do declare, I mean not to bind up myself
in my station, but, in a lawful way, to en∣deavour
any thing I think for the advan∣tage
of the church or state, not repugnant
to the protestant religion and my loyalty;
and this I understand as a part of my oath."</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE></P>
<P>This being declared treason by the learn∣ed
of the law, he was sent prisoner to the
castle of Edinburgh, soon after tried, found
guilty, his estate forfeited, and himself sen∣tenced
to suffer death: but he made his escape
in the dress of a lady's page, and got over to
Holland, where he remained about four years.
However, in the beginning of king James
VII.'s reign, he got some officers and sol∣diers
together in Holland, with which he in∣vaded
Scotland, and landed in Argyleshire.</P>
<P>He raised about two thousand men, mostly
of his own clan. He then emitted a manifesto,
declaring, <Q REND="inline">"That he had not invaded his coun∣try
for any private ends, but in defence of
his own just right, and for the recovery of
his estate, which was unjustly forfeited in
the reign of the late king. And the duke
of York having invaded the religion and
liberties of the kingdom, he thought it not
only just, but his duty to God and his coun∣try,
to oppose his tyrannical usurpation, and
invited all true protestants to join him."</Q></P>
<P>The earl's little army being defeated and
dispersed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch comp. p. 103.</NOTE> and himself taken prisoner, he was
again sent to the castle of Edinburgh, and
soon thereafter beheaded at the mercat-cross,
in consequence of his former sentence, upon
the 30th of June 1685; it being the opini∣on
of the lawyers, that as he was already dead
in law, he could not be tried again for this
last act of rebellion.</P>
<P>He left issue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> by lady Mary Stewart his
wife, daughter of James earl of Murray, four
sons and two daughters.</P>

Richard earl of Lauderdale, and 2dly to
Charles earl of Murray.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to William mar∣quis
of Lothian.</P>
<P>XXII. ARCHIBALD, tenth earl, after∣wards
duke of Argyle, eldest son of Archi∣bald
the ninth earl, came over with the prince
of Orange, from Holland, in 1688; and was
owned by the convention of estates to be
earl of Argyle, before his father's forfeiture
was rescinded.</P>
<P>He was a great promoter of the revolution,
and was sent to London by the nobility and
gentry of Scotland, with sir James Montgo∣mery
and sir John Dalrymple, to make an
offer of the crown of Scotland, in name of
the convention of estates, to the prince and
princess of Orange,</P>
<P>Who, on the 11th of April 1689, were
crowned king and queen of Scotland; and on
the 11th of May following, the earl, with the
other commissioners tendered the oath of co∣ronation
to their Majesties, which they took
accordingly.</P>
<P>He afterwards, for the king's service, sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
over to Flanders a regiment, both officers and
soldiers of his own name and clan, who upon
many occasions signalized their bravery and
courage.</P>
<P>This noble earl was made one of the pri∣vy-council
in May 1689, and one of the lords
of the treasury in 1690.</P>
<P>He was also made colonel of the Scotch
horse guards, and one of the extraordinary
lords of Session, and, at last for his many emi∣nent
services, he was created duke of Argyle,
marquis of Kintyre and Lorne, earl of Camp∣bell
and Cowal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in cancellaria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Haeredibus masculis qui∣buscunque.</NOTE> viscount of Lochow and Glen∣isla,
lord Inverara, Mull, Morvien and Tyrie,
by letters patent to his heirs-male whatsom∣ever,
bearing date at Kensington, the 23d of
June 1701.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51"/>
He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir Lio∣nel
Talmash of Helingham, by his wife E∣lizabeth,
dutchess of Lauderdale, daughter and
heir of William Murray earl of Dysart, by
whom he had two sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> duke of Argyle.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Archibald,</HI> earl of Islay, thereafter duke
of Argyle.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married James
Stewart earl of Bute.</P>
<P>Archibald, first duke of Argyle, died in
1703, and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XXIII. JOHN, second duke of Argyle,
whose genius leading him to a military life,
he went early into the British service, and
bravely distinguished himself thro' the whole
course of queen Anne's wars.</P>
<P>In 1701, he had the command of a regi∣ment
of foot; was made one of the extraordina∣ry
lords of session in 1704; one of the knights
of the thistle, and her majesty's high com∣missioner
to the parliament of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI>
1705.</P>
<P>He remarkably signalized himself at the
battle of Ramillies in 1706, and at the at∣tack
of the counterscarp of Menin, of which
place he took possession.</P>
<P>He commanded at reducing the fort of Ple∣pondale,
assisted at the siege of Ostend, and
was very serviceable at the battle of Aude∣nard,
<HI>anno</HI> 1708.</P>
<P>He assisted at the siege of Lisle (of which
city he took possession;) also at the siege of
Ghent and Bruges in 1709.</P>
<P>In the same year he particularly aggrandiz∣ed
himself at the siege of Tournay, and at
the terrible attack of the wood in the great
battle of Malplaquet, upon which desperate
command he was ordered by the duke of
Marlborough, who, ('tis alledged) then be∣gun
to be jealous of his rising glory.</P>
<P>He was created baron of Chatham, earl
of Greenwich in England, and was general
and commander in chief of her majesty's forces
in Spain, <HI>anno</HI> 1710; was governor of Mi∣norca,
and one of the privy-council in Eng∣land,
and was made knight of the most noble
order of the garter.</P>
<P>On the death of queen Anne, he was one
of the lords justices till the arrival of king
George I. and was soon thereafter made gen∣tleman
of the bed-chamber, and groom of
the stole to his royal highness George prince
of Wales, and commander in chief of all his
majesty's forces in North-Britain.</P>
<P>In 1715, a rebellion broke out in Scot∣land,
and the earl of Mar had the address to
get together no less than six or seven thou∣sand
Highlanders, who marched from Perth
about the 12th of November. The duke of
Argyle marched out from Stirling about the
same time to oppose them. They came to
an engagement at Sheriffmuir upon the 13th,
where the duke of Argyle's courage and con∣duct
was very remarkable; for tho' the rebels
were far more numerous (and many of the
clans fought very gallantly) yet they were
forced to retreat to Perth, and the duke of
Argyle returned to Stirling; however, the
rebels never came to a head again.</P>
<P>In the year 1718, he was made lord stew∣ard
of the houshold, and was created duke
of Greenwich, but the patent was limited to
the heirs-male of his body.</P>
<P>He was colonel, first, of the queen's regi∣ment
of horse, and then of the royal blue
horse guards. He was likeways master-gene∣ral
of the ordnance, and field-marshal of Great
Britain.</P>
<P>He was no less conspicuous for his spirited
eloquence in the house of peers, than for his
courage and conduct in the field. He parti∣cularly
distinguished himself in the noble de∣fence
he made of the privileges of the town
of Edinburgh, when it was moved that they
should be taken away, on account of the mur∣der
of captain Porteous.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, he merited the celebrat∣ed
character which Pope gives him:</P>
<P>ARGYLE, <HI>the state's whole thunder born to
weild,</HI></P>
<P><HI>And shake alike the senate and the field.</HI></P>
<P>He married, 1st, Mary, daughter of John
Brown Esq; but she died without issue.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Mrs. Jean Warburton,
one of the maids of honour, both to queen
Anne, and queen Caroline, when princess of
Wales, and by her had five daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Caroline,</HI> married, 1st, to Fran∣cis
earl of Dalkeith, eldest son of Francis
duke of Buccleugh. And, 2dly, to Charles
Townshend, Esq; second son to lord viscount
Townshend, now secretary at war.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to William earl of
Strafford.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> died young.</P>

James Stewart M'Kenzie, son of James earl
of Bute.</P>
<P>5. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married to Edward vis∣count
Coke, son and heir apparent to the earl
of Leicester.</P>
<P>The Duke died in October 1743, in the
63d year of his age, and having no sons, the
titles of Duke of Greenwich and baron of
Chatham expired with him, but he was suc∣ceeded
in his estate and other titles by his bro∣ther,</P>

XXIII. ARCHIBALD, third duke of Ar∣gyle,
who was born at Hamhouse, in Eng∣land,
in June 1682, and was educated at the
university of Glasgow. He afterwards ap∣plied
himself to the study of the law at U∣trecht;
but upon his father's being created a
duke, he laid aside the scheme of appearing
at the bar, and betook himself to a military
life, served under the great duke of Marlbo∣rough,
was colonel of the thirty-sixth regi∣ment
of foot, and governor of Dambarton
castle: But his genius pointing more strong∣ly
to the statesman than the soldier, he did
not continue long in the army, but applied
himself chiefly to that study, which made the
after part of his life so shining and conspi∣cuous.</P>
<P>In 1705, he was made treasurer of Scot∣land,
and took his seat in the parliament,
where he made so great a figure, that in 1706
he was nominated one of the commissioners
for the treaty of union, and got a patent, cre∣ating
him earl and viscount Islay, lord Oron∣say,
Dunoon and Arrois, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In 1708; he was made an extraordinary
lord of session, was elected one of the sixteen
peers for the first British parliament, and was
chosen member to every future session, ex∣cepting
that called to meet in November
1713.</P>
<P>In 1710, he was made justice-general of
Scotland; and in 1711 he was called to the
privy council.</P>
<P>In 1714, upon the accession of king George
I. he was nominated lord register; and tho'
he had long before given up all command in
the army, yet, upon the breaking out of the
rebellion 1715, he again betook himself to
arms, in defence of the house of Hanover,
and, by his prudent conduct in the west high∣lands,
prevented general Gordon, at the head
of 3000 men, from penetrating into the coun∣try,
and raising levies. He afterwards join∣ed
his brother at Stirling, and was wounded
at the battle of Dumblane.</P>
<P>In 1725, he got the privy seal, and was
trusted with the direction of Scotch affairs.</P>
<P>In 1734, upon his resigning the privy seal,
he was made keeper of the great seal, which
he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>Upon the dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of his brother, he be∣came
dake of Argyle, hereditary justice ge∣neral,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>euten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, sheriff and commissary of
Argyleshire, and the western isles, hereditary
great master of the houshold, hereditary keep∣er
of Dunstaffnage, Carrick, and several other
castles.</P>
<P>He was a man of great natural and acquired
endowments, quick, penetrating, and tho∣roughly
versant in the knowledge of man∣kind;
of an accurate and distinct elocution,
and a ready judgment. His thorough know∣ledge
of the laws of his country qualified him
to shine in the great council of the nation,
and in the cabinet of his sovereign. His great
sagacity and uncommon abilities, pointed him
out as a proper person for the chief manage∣ment
of all Scotch affairs; and the propriety
of the choice will appear from his attention
to promote trade and manufactures, to en∣courage
learning and learned men, and for∣ward
every improvement for the good of his
country.</P>
<P>During his administration; the manufac∣ture
of linen cloth was raised to an uncom∣mon
pitch, both in quality and quantity.
The universities received distinguishing marks
of his favour, by establishing new profes∣sions,
and in every shape promoting their
good: particularly, he encouraged the pro∣fession
of physic in the university of Edin∣burgh,
which is now a school for that sci∣ence,
famous all over Europe.</P>
<P>He procured from his late majesty, king
George II. for the infirmary of Edinburgh,
the invalid money, to the extent of about
8000l. a sum that enabled the managers of
that hospital to enlarge their plan considerab∣ly,
the utility of which is daily felt by the
numbers of poor patients, both civil and mi∣litary,
who find relief from this charity.</P>
<P>After 1745, in order to destroy the seeds
of future rebellions, he advised his majesty
to employ the highlanders in the army; a
proposal worthy of the patriot who contrived
it, magnanimous in the king who approved
it, and most honourable to themselves who
executed it; for it must be owned that, to
this wise counsel, 'tis in some measure ow∣ing,
that Cape Breton, Canada, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> are
now under the government of this kingdom,
as the courage and intrepidity of these brave
and heroic men, wherever they were called,
doubtless contributed greatly to the conquests.</P>
<P>Such was Archib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d in a public sphere;
nor was he less distinguished in private life.
His eminent learning, and strong natural ta∣lents,
contributed to make him pass his hours
of recess from business agreeably to himself,
and for the instruction and good of others.
He was qualified for every subject of conver∣sation,
with the greatest philosopher, or the
meanest and most ingenious mechanic. For
the amusement of the closet, he collected the
most valuable private library in Great Bri∣tain,
where he unbent his mind from the
cares of ministerial affairs, and added to the
immense stock of knowledge he had already
acquired.</P>
<P>The noble and magnificent palace which
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
he has built at Inverara, will stand a lasting
monument of the regard he had for his fami∣ly,
who before had no house suitable to their
dignity.</P>
<P>This great man enjoyed all the faculties of
his mind found and entire till his death, which
happened very suddenly, on the 15th day of
April 1761, in the 79th year of his age;
and was, according to his own orders, buried
at Kilmun, in the parish of Dunoon in Ar∣gyleshire,
the burying-place of the family.
And having no issue, his estate and honours
devolved upon his cousin and heir-male ge∣neral
John Campbell, (now duke of Argyle)
eldest son and heir of the honourable John
Campbell of Mammore, to whom we now
return.</P>

<P>During the rebellion in 1715, he served
as aid-de-camp to John then duke of Argyle,
who commanded the king's army; and dur∣ing
the rebellion 1745, he had the honour
to command all his majesty's troops and gar∣risons
in the west of Scotland. He served in
the rank of brigadier-general at the battle of
Dettingen in the year 1741, where the Bri∣tish
troops were victorious over the French;
and thereafter as major-general in sundry o∣ther

to be so to his majesty during the whole of

commands. He is also lieutenant-general on
the staff in England, and governor of Lime∣rick
castle in Ireland.</P>

of Dumbarton in every parliament since the

for that county, but succeeding immediately
thereafter to the estate and honours of Argyle,
he was, on the 5th day of May 1761, elec∣ted
one of the sixteen peers for representing
the peerage of Scotland in parliament, and is
now the fourth duke.</P>
<P>In the 1720, he married the honourable

<HEAD>Earl of ATHOLE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is one of the most antient and
most honourable titles in the king∣dom
of Scotland. It has been enjoyed by
more of the royal family than any other,
and was first conferred upon</P>
<P>I. MALCOLM, son of king Donald VII.
brother of king Malcolm Canmore. He was
one of the greatest men of his time, was cre∣ated

<P>He died before the year 1300, leaving is∣sue

<P>VI. DAVID de STRABOGIE, ninth earl of
Athole, who married Isabella, daughter of Ri∣chard,
natural son of John king of England, by
whom he got a vast estate in that kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Bal∣four's collect.</NOTE>
which at last proved the ruin of the fami∣ly.</P>
<P>He did not long survive his father, but was
succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VII. JOHN de STRABOGIE, tenth earl of
Athole, who was one of those worthy pa∣triots,
that joined king Robert Bruce as soon
as he began to assert his title to the crown;
and was with him at the battle of Methven,
but was afterwards unfortunately taken priso∣ner,
and carried to London.</P>
<P>And, having formerly been obliged, with
many of his brave countrymen, to swear feal∣ty
to king Edward I. he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England, and all the Scotch historians.</NOTE> on that account,
tried for high treason, found guilty, condemn∣ed,
and executed in the flower of his age, with

<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VIII. DAVID de STRABOLGIE, eleventh
earl of Athole, who, for several years, was
a faithful subject, and in high favour with
king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>He was sent prisoner to London, for ad∣hering

he returned to king Robert, who made him
lord high constable of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Arbroath.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1311,
and conferred many other favours upon him.</P>
<P>But he having large possessions in England,
was strongly attached to that kingdom. At
last he withdrew his allegiance from his law∣ful
sovereign and benefactor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IV. p. 437.</NOTE> joined the inter∣est
of the Baliols, and went to England, where
he was well received by king Edward, from
whom he got grants of many lands, and pen∣sions
to a considerable extent.</P>
<P>King Robert, on account of the great me∣rit
of his ancestors, and sufferings of his fa∣ther,
was very tender in degrading or for∣seiting
him, and used all possible means to re∣claim
him, but in vain.</P>
<P>At length, the office of constable of Scot∣land,
which had formerly been given during the
king's pleasure only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. pe∣nes comitem de Errol.</NOTE> was bestowed upon that

to him and his heirs for ever, <HI>anno</HI> 1315.</P>
<P>In 1327, there was a treaty of peace be∣twixt
Scotland and England concluded at
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
Northamton, whereby it was provided, that
no Scotch, or Englishman could possess lands
or titles in Scotland, unless he resided in that
kingdom. This earl then absolutely refus∣ing
to return to his allegiance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, and hist. of Scot∣land.</NOTE> was outlawed,
and his estate and titles forfeited to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1327. Which he resented highly, and
was ever after an implacable enemy to his
country. In the minority of king David Bruce,
he accepted of the command of a body of Eng∣lish
troops, in favours of Edward Baliol, and
was killed at the battle of Kilblain, <HI>anno</HI>
1335.</P>
<P>He married Jean or Johanna,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE> eldest daugh∣ter
and co-heiress of John Cummin lord of
Badenoch, by whom he got a considerable ac∣cession
to his estate, and by her had a son,</P>

<P>'Tis alledged, he had several other sons,
who, after their father's forfeiture, laid aside

in Scotland. 'Tis said also, that of these

other families in the North, are descended.</P>

the earldom of Athole upon the lord

<HEAD>MURRAY Duke of ATHOLE, Earl of TUL∣LIBARDIN,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our historians agree; that the sir∣name
of MURRAY is amongst the
most antient of any in Scotland. Some de∣rive
their origin from a warlike people called
the Moravii,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's ge∣nealogical collections, vol. 1st, page 367, &amp;c.</NOTE> who came from Germany, and
are said to have performed many great ex∣ploits
in Scotland, in favours of king Cor∣bred
I. against the Romans.</P>
<P>Others are of opinion, they assumed that
sirname from the county of Murray, where
they had large possessions in very early times.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the progenitors of this great
and illustrious family had considerable estates,
both in Perthshire and the northern counties,
in the tenth and eleventh centuries. But we
shall pass over all traditional accounts, and
proceed to our documents.</P>
<P>I. FRISKINUS de MORAVIA was pro∣prietor
of a vast many lands and baronies in
different counties, and made a great figure in
Scotland in the reign of king David I. who
succeeded to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1124, and died
<HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>This Friskin was father of</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM de MORAVIA, who got a

the lyon, <HI>Willielmo de Moravia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilio Fris∣kini,</HI>
of the lands of Strabrock, Duffus, Rossile,

were possessed by his father Friskin in the
reign of king David I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quas terras Friskinus pa∣ter suus te∣nuit, tempore regis David; &amp;c. Chart. penes comi∣tem de Bu∣chan.</NOTE> The charter has no
date; but as Felix, bishop of Murray, was wit∣ness

the year 1171, in which that bishop died.</P>
<P>William had issue two sons, betwixt whom
he divided his lands.</P>

<P>III. HUGH, the eldest son, got possession
of the lands of Dussus; which then was the

<P>IV. WALTER, who, in an agreement a∣bout
the division of some lands with Archi∣bald
bishop of Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Murray, pe∣nes Macfar∣lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 10.</NOTE> is designed <HI>Walterus

<P>Walter was father of</P>

<HI>Friskinus de Moravia, dominus de Duffus, fili∣us
Walteri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. p. 92.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1248.</P>
<P>This Friskinus had no male-issue, and but
two daughters,</P>

de Cheyne, who with her obtained the ba∣rony
of Duffus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. and Nis∣bet's append. p. 192.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. <HI>Christian,</HI> married to William de Fede∣rith.</P>
<P>In a charter by Malise, earl of Strathern,
to his sister Annabella of the lands of Kin∣cardine,
the above Friskinus de Moravia de
Duffus, together with sir Malcolm de Mo∣ravia,
are witnesses.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE> The charter is dated
at Selkirk the 28th of June, the 22d year

<P>This sir Malcolm was the undoubted an∣cestor
of the Murrays of Tullibardin, and
was son of sir John de Moravia, high sheriff of
Perth, who probably was a grandson of the
first Friskin, and brother of Hugh, tho' we
cannot, at this distance of time, positively as∣certain
the relation.</P>
<P>From this sir John therefore (by good au∣thority)
we shall deduce the descent of this
illustrious family, which hath flourished in
Perthshire, with great lustre, about six hun∣dred
years.</P>
<P>I. Sir JOHN de MORAVIA, or MURRAY,
appears to have been a man of the first rank;
and made a considerable figure in the end of
the reign of king William the lion, and be∣ginning
of king Alexander II. who succeeded
to the crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>He is particularly named in a donation to
the abbacy of Arbroath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Arbroath, pe∣nes Macfar∣lane, p. 247, and 248.</NOTE> together with Gui∣do

who, when a young man, together with
his cousin; David viscount of Stormont, had
the good fortune to be greatly instrumental in
the rescue of the king at Perth, from the attempt
of the earl Gowrie and his brother against the
sacred persori of his majesty, <HI>anno</HI> 1600. For
that signal service, he got the sheriffship of
Perthshire (which had heretably belonged to
the house of Ruthven) conferred upon him
during the king's pleasure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's app. p. 200.</NOTE> and it has mostly
continued in the family of Athole ever since.</P>
<P>He married Dorothea, eldest daughter and

had one son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> who afterwards became earl of A∣thole,—and
one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to sir John Moncrief
of that ilk.</P>
<P>This earl, a little before his death, know∣ing
that his son was heir of line to the earldom
of Athole, and being unwilling that the e∣state
and honours of Athole and Tullibardin
should be conjoined in the same person, made
a resignation of his title of Tullibardin into the
king's hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in cancellaria, 1mo Aprilis 1686.</NOTE> iu favours of his brother Patrick, in

<P>We now return to</P>

<P>XVI. JOHN MURRAY, his only son by
lady Dorothea Stewart, eldest daughter of
John fifth earl of Athole, and undoubted heir
of line to John the first earl of that illustrious
house.</P>
<P>It seems the writs of the family had not
hitherto been carefully looked into, which
occasioned several mistakes in this peerage;
but these were all at last rectified: for, as
the estate and honours of Athole, by the char∣ters
dated 1460, 1473, and 1477, before
recited, in Title, <HI>Stewart earl of Athole,</HI> de∣scended
to the heirs of the patentee's body

appears to have been unquestionable; and he
was accordingly served and retoured heir, in

of Athole, brother uterine to King James II.

<P>This John earl of Athole was a man of sin∣gular
worth and probity. As soon as the ci∣vil
war broke out, he attached himself en∣tirely
to his majesty's interest, in which he
persisted with great firmness and fidelity. He
raised about two thousand of his own men for
the king's service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pendix.</NOTE> and declared he would op∣pose
every measure that was contrary to the

<P>This earl died in 1642, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XVII. JOHN earl of Athole, who adhered
firmly to the interest both of king Charles I.
and II. In 1653, he raised for the king a∣bove
two thousand men, for which he suffer∣ed
great hardships before the restoration;
but, in consideration thereof, his majesty
was pleased to constitute him one of his pri∣vy-council,
and master of his houshold, in
1661.</P>
<P>He got a charter under the great seal <HI>hae∣reditarii

<P>His majesty king James VII. having like∣ways
a great opinion of his loyalty and me∣rit,
gave him the command of the troops sent
to suppress the insurrection of the earl of Ar∣gyle
in the West.</P>
<P>In the year 1687, he was created one of
the knights of the thistle, and the revolution
happening soon thereafter, he retired from all
public business, and spent the remainder of his
days, at some of his fine seats in Perthshire,
in great peace and tranquillity.</P>
<P>He married lady Emilia Stanly, daughter of
that loyal and valiant patriot James earl of
Derby in England, (who was beheaded for
his inviolable attachment to the royal family
in 1651) by his wife lady Charlotte, daughter

<HEAD>CUMMIN Lord of BADENOCH.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of CUMMIN is of great
antiquity, but the origin is doubtful.
Some deduce them from Hungary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And. Win∣ton's M. S. Chron. of Scotland in the lawyer's library, Edr.</NOTE> others
say they are of Norman extract.</P>
<P>There were certainly several considerable
and flourishing families of that sirname in
Scotland in very early times, and many great
men amongst them who were an ornament to
their country, tho' some of them had the
misfortune to act against it.</P>
<P>They flourished for the space of 250 years,
<HI>viz.</HI> from 1080 to 1330, about which last
aera they begun to decline; but there arc still
some considerable gentlemen's families in Scot∣land
descended of them.</P>
<P>The first we can give an account of, with
any certainty, is</P>
<P>I. COMES ROBERTUS CUMMIN, who
appears to have been a man of the first rank
in the reign of king Malcolm Canmore, and
was killed with that prince at the battle of
Alnwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. of Melross.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1093, leaving issue two in∣fant

<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> a man eminent for natural
and acquired endowments, and highly esteem∣ed
by king David I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. and lives of the officers of state, p. 8.</NOTE> who constituted him
lord high chancellor of Scotland in the begin∣ning
of his reign. In 1142, he was prefer∣red
to the episcopal see of Durham by Maud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 9. &amp; D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rymple's Collections, p. 174.</NOTE>
the empress, and died before the year 1159.</P>
<P>II. JOHN de CUMMIN succceded Robert,
but we never find him designed <HI>Comes,</HI> tho'
he made a considerable figure in the reign of
king Alexander I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's ge∣nealogical collections, vol. II. p. 75.</NOTE> and of this John, 'tis said,

<P>He was father of</P>

Hexetilda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Kelso, penes Mac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arlane.</NOTE> grandchild of Donald king of

but, according to Mr. Martin and others, he
was <HI>ostiarius domini regis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>

<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
in Tweedale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Register of Kelso, p. 243.</NOTE> to the monks of Kelso, <HI>pro sa∣lute

<P>He left issue three sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Walter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Dumfermline penesMacfar∣lane, p. 210.</NOTE> who was created earl of

<P>Sir Richard's third son, sir <HI>William,</HI> was
afterwards earl of Buchan.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. Sir JOHN, who was called the Red
Cummin, and was the first we find designed
lord of Badenoch.</P>
<P>He was a man of great abilities, and was
sent ambassador to Lewis IX. king of France,
by king Alexander II. <HI>anno</HI> 1240, where he
negotiated some affairs of importance, greatly
to the king's satisfaction.</P>
<P>According to Cambden, he married Ada,
daughter of Patrick Galloway, earl of Athole;
but, according to Buchanan (by whom he is
also designed earl of Mar) he married Mary,
daughter of Alan lord of Galloway, by whom
he had a son,</P>

<P>1. <HI>Jean,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE> or <HI>Johanna,</HI> married to David

called the Black Cummin, inferior to no sub∣ject
then in the kingdom for wealth and pow∣er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lections, v. III. p. 651.</NOTE>
and was designed John Cummin senior de
Badenoch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was one of the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> who a∣greed
to stand by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 266.</NOTE> and support queen Marga∣ret,
grandchild to king Alexander III. and
defend her title to the crown of Scotland a∣gainst
all mortals, <HI>anno</HI> 1284.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the six governors
of this kingdom <HI>anno</HI> 1286,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 431 and 471.</NOTE> and agreed to the
marriage of the queen with king Edward of
England's eldest son, <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>After queen Margaret's death, he became
one of the competitors for the crown, as son
and heir of John, who was son and heir of
Richard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne, vol III. p. 515.</NOTE> son and heir of William, son and
heir of Hexetilda, daughter and heiress of Goth∣rick,
son and heir of Donald, king of Scotland.
But it is well known how that affair was de∣termined
by king Edward of England, in fa∣vours
of John Baliol;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom II. p. 558.</NOTE> and we find him soon
thereafter swearing allegiance to king Edward
I, of England, as over-lord of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI>
1292.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 776. liberati sunt Johannes Cummin de Badenoch, et Johannes Cummin de Badenoch, jun. &amp;c.</NOTE> both he and his son were carried
prisoners to England, and were not set at li∣berty
till the year 1297, and he died soon
thereafter.</P>
<P>He married Marjory daughter of John,
and sister of king John Baliol, by whom he
had a son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>'Tis said he had also a daughter married to
Archibald Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Home's hist. of the family of Douglas, Abercrombie, &amp;c.</NOTE> lord of Galloway, ance∣stor
of the duke of Douglas.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VIII. JOHN CUMMIN, lord of Badenoch,
who was a man of extensive property, pow∣erful
by his wealth and dependents, cunning,
artful and dissembling, fond of dignity and
rank; and, provided he could obtain his wishes,
extremely careless by what means, however
base and dishonourable.</P>
<P>Scotland had now for a considerable time
groaned under the yoke of English servitude;
Baliol had meanly given up his pretended
right to the crown to Edward; Bruce had
secretly intimated to his friends his intention
of asserting his title to the royal dignity, and
redeeming the liberty of his country. Cum∣min,
ever mindful of his own interest, enter∣ed
into the design, and made a solemn engage∣ment
with Robert to assist him with all his
power in mounting the throne; provided,
upon the success of the affair, he should be
restored to the vast possessions his family had
enjoyed, which would have aggrandized him
much beyond any other subject, and placed
him in a condition little inferior to royal:
but, upon maturer consideration, and weigh∣ing
the matter in the balance of self-interest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, For∣dun, Aber∣crombie, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>
he began to doubt the event; the attempt was
hazardous; he dreaded the strength of Eng∣land;
every chance seemed against the cause;
if it failed, he was undone: how to mend the
step he had taken was to be determined; his
own black heart suggested the detestable re∣medy,
either from the hopes of great re∣wards
from the English, or perhaps with a
view to the crown itself, in virtue of his mo∣ther,
who was Baliol's sister; he divulged the
whole schemes of the Scotch patriots to the
king of England. Bruce was then in Lon∣don,
but happily in time discovered he was be∣trayed,
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
and, not without difficulty, made his
escape to Scotland, where finding clear proof
of the villainy of Cummin, he caused pursue
him to the church of Dumfries; whither; from
conscious guilt, he had fled for refuge; and
punished him as his crime deserved. Not the
house of GOD, not even the altar; was to be
allowed an asylum to protect such infamous
treason and persidy. He fell indeed by too
honourable hands, as a hangman or common
executioner should have performed what was
done by the Boyd, the Fleming, and the
Lindsay, on 10th February 1306.</P>
<P>Having no issue, he was the last lord of
Badenoch, of the name of Cummin.</P>

<P>XI. ALEXANDER, second earl of Craw∣furd,

<P>3. Sir <HI>James,</HI> the first of the family of
Balmerino.</P>
<P>I. Sir JAMES ELPHINGSTON, third son
of Robert third lord Elphingston, designed
of Barnton, was a man of great parts and a∣bilities,
and highly esteemed by king James
VI. who constituted him one of the senators
of the college of justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1586, one of
the lords of the treasury, then called Octa∣vians,
<HI>anno</HI> 1595, secretary of state in 1598,
and lord president of the session soon there∣after;
in all which high offices he acquitted
himself with great integrity, judgment, and
sufficiency.</P>
<P>He was also appointed one of the commis∣sioners
to treat of an union with England,
which at that time took no effect.</P>
<P>King James, in consideration of his faith∣ful
services and great merit, was pleased to
erect the lands, belonging to the abbacy of
Balmerino, into a temporal lordship and ba∣rony,
in favours of sir James Elphingston of
Barnton, knight, secretary of state, one of the
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
lords of secret council, and senator of the col∣lege
of justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. haere∣dibus mascu∣lis, talliae &amp; provisionis.</NOTE> and raised him to the dignity
of the peerage, by the title of lord Balmerino,
to him, and his heirs-male, tailzie, and pro∣vision,
by a charter, under the great seal, dat∣ed
the 20th of February 1603.</P>
<P>He was possessed of a great estate, which
appears from no less than nine charters under
the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. inter 1661 &amp; 1609.</NOTE> in the public registers; parti∣cularly
he purchased from Robert Logan of
Restalrig the lands and barony of Restalrig,
<HI>anno</HI> 1604, upon which lands he got a char∣ter,
under the great seal, <HI>Jacobo domino de
Balmerinoch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad annum 1605.</NOTE> <HI>terrarum baroniae de Restalrig,</HI>
dated 16th May 1605.</P>
<P>This circumstance of the purchase of the ba∣rony
of Restalrig, evidently disproves a story,
which has long prevailed with many, that Lo∣gan
was forfeited by the king, after he was
dead, for the immediate purpose of bestowing
his lands on his favourite secretary Balmeri∣no;
Logan was not forfeited till the 24th
June 1609: 'Tis plain from the above char∣ter,
that Balmerino purchased these lands at
least four years before, and it may be further
observed, that tho' Logan had once a good
estate, he appears to have been denuded of
all, and entirely bankrupt some years before
his death. For,</P>
<P>His lands of Mount Lothan and Nether Go∣gar,
were purchased by Andrew Logan of
Coatfield, <HI>anno</HI> 1596.</P>
<P>His lands of Fastcastle, and others in the
shire of Berwick, were acquired by Archi∣bald
Douglas of Pittendreich, <HI>anno</HI> 1602.</P>
<P>His lands of Restalrig, by lord Balmerino,
in 1604, as before observed.</P>
<P>And his lands of Quarrelholes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
1605.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> All which is fully instructed by char∣ters

betwixt 1612 and 1616,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> got charters, under
the great seal, of his lands of Balmerino, Rest∣alrig,
and many others.</P>
<P>He was likewise a man of great parts and
learning. At the beginning of the civil wars,
he was on the parliament's side but he no
sooner observed them making too great en∣croachments
upon the royal prerogative, than
he joined the king's party, and continued stea∣dy
in his majesty's interest till his death.</P>
<P>He married Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas
Ker of Fernyhurst, sister to Andrew lord Jed∣burgh
and Robert earl of Somerset, by whom

true lover of his country.</P>
<P>At the parliament 1706, he opposed the
union with all his interest; however, some
years after it was concluded, he was elected
one of the sixteen peers to represent Scot∣land
in the British parliaments, called to
meet <HI>anno</HI> 1710 and 1713, and was made
general of the mint and sheriff of Edinburgh.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Christian Montgo∣mery,
daughter of Hugh earl of Eglington,
by whom he had two sons, and two daughters,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Hugh,</HI> master of Balmerino, who was kil∣led
at the siege of Lisle in 1708, without issue.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards lord Balmerino.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to sir
John Preston of Prestonhall, and had issue a
son, and a daughter.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Jean,</HI> married to Francis earl of Murray,
and was mother of James now earl of Murray.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Anne daughter of Dr.
Arthur Ross, archbishop of St. Andrews, by
whom he had two sons, and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Arthur,</HI> afterward lord Balmerino.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Alexander Elphingston,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>His daughter,—, died also without issue.</P>
<P>This worthy lord died in 1736, and was
succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>V. JAMES fifth lord Balmerino, a man of
great worth, honour, and integrity. He was
one of the senators of the college of justice,
and always behaved with judgment and im∣partiality.</P>
<P>He married lady Betty Carnegie, daughter
of David carl of Northesk, but died without
issue, and was succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>V. ARTHUR, sixth lord Balmerino, a man
of great honour, courage, and intrepidity.
He was bred to the army, and, in the queen's
time, was captain of a company of foot.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="75"/>
In 1745 he engaged in the rebellion, and,
after the battle of Culloden, was taken priso∣ner,
carried to London, tried before the
house of lords, found guilty of high treason,
condemned, and beheaded on Towerhill the
18th of August 1746, in the fifty-eight year
of his age, where he behaved with uncom∣mon
constancy and resolution.</P>
<P>As this lord's behaviour was magnanimous
and great, during his confinement, and at his
execution, we shall take the liberty here to
insert a few passages from a paper published,
by the authority of the sheriff of London, af∣ter
his death.</P>
<P>A little before he was carried to Towerhill,
he demanded an interview with lord Kilmar∣nock,
who was in the same unhappy situation
with himself, which was granted: After it
was ended, the two lords saluted one another,
and Balmerino <Q REND="inline">"bid lord Kilmarnock an eternal
happy adieu, and, with a chearful counte∣nance,
added, My dear lord, I wish I could
alone pay the reckoning, and suffer for us
both, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>During the time the scaffold was putting
in order for the execution of lord Balmerino,
the sheriff, that attended at the first exe∣cution,
went to Balmerino's apartments, as a
notice to his lordship that his time was come;
upon whose entrance his lordship said, <Q REND="inline">"I sup∣pose
lord Kilmarnock is no more;"</Q> and hav∣ing
asked how the executioner performed his
duty; upon receiving the account, said, <Q REND="inline">"Then
it was well done; and now, gentlemen, said
his lordship, I will detain you no longer,
for I desire not to protract my life."</Q> He
then saluted the company, in a manner so
chearful, as drew tears from every eye but
his own, and hastened to the scaffold.</P>
<P>But before we view his lordship on the
scaffold, 'tis but just to the memory of that
great, but unhappy man, to acquaint the pu∣blic
what was his deportment in his retire∣ment
here: 'Twas graceful, without affecta∣tion;
chearful, but not presumptuous: He
conversed freely with his friends, twice re∣freshed
himself with a bit of bread and a glass
of wine, and desired the company to drink to
him, <HI>Ain degrae ta haiven;</HI> but, above all,
he called frequently upon God, and seemed
both willing and prepared to die.</P>
<P>When he mounted the scaffold, he did it with
so undaunted a step, as surprised every spectator
that was unacquainted with the greatness of his
soul.</P>
<P>He walked round the scaffold, bowed to
the people, read the following inscription on
his coffin: <HI>Arthurus dominus de Balmerino, de∣collatus</HI>
18 <HI>die Augusti</HI> 1746, <HI>aetatis suae</HI> 58;
said it was right, and, with seeming plea∣sure,
looked on the block, which he called
his pillow of rest.</P>
<P>He then called for the executioner, who,
being introduced to him, was about to ask
his forgiveness; but my lord stopt him, and
said, <Q REND="inline">"Friend, you need not ask me forgive∣ness,
the execution of your duty is com∣mendable;"</Q>
then presenting the executio∣ner
with three guineas, said, <Q REND="inline">"Friend, I never
had much money; this is all I have; I wish
it was more for your sake, and am sorry I
can add nothing else to it but my coat and
waistcoat,"</Q> which he instantly took off, and
placed on his coffin for the executioner. Hav∣ing
prepared himself for the block, he took
his last farewel of them; and, having once
more taken a view of the great number of
spectators, his lordship said, <Q REND="inline">"I am afraid
there are some who may think my behavi∣our
bold;"</Q> and, speaking to a gentleman
near him, added, <Q REND="inline">"Remember, sir, what I
tell you; it arises from a confidence in
God, and a clear conscience."</Q></P>
<P>Then observing the executioner with the
ax in his hand, took it from him, and having
felt the edge, return'd it him again, at the same
time showing him where to strike the blow,
and animating him to do it with resolution,
<Q REND="inline">"For in that, friend, said he, will consist your
mercy."</Q></P>
<P>His lordship then, with the same surprising
countenance, kneeled down at the block, and
having, with his arms extended, said this short
prayer, <Q REND="inline">"O Lord, reward my friends, forgive
my enemies, and receive my soul,"</Q> sub∣mitted,
and gave the signal to the executioner.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of Capt. Chalmers,
by whom he had no issue, whereby the male-line
of this family is extinct.</P>

is dated at Whitehall, the 10th day of Feb∣ruary

<P>The lord Belhaven died <HI>anno</HI> 1679, and,
according to the above-mentioned patent, his
estate and honours devolved upon the said sir
John, who being married to his grandchild by
his daughter Anne, to her we now return.</P>
<P>VII. ANNE, second daughter of John first

by whom she had an only child,</P>
<P>VIII. MARGARET, married to the said
sir John Hamilton of Biel, who, upon the
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
death of the first lord, succeeded to his estate
and honours as before observed.</P>
<P>John, second lord Belhaven, was eldest son
and heir of sir Robert Hamilton of Pressmanan,
one of the senators of the college of justice,
descended from the family of Udston, whose
lineal ancestor was Andrew Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Bel∣haven, and Nisbet, vol. I. page 176.</NOTE> third
son of sir David lord of Cadzow, who flou∣rished
in the reigns of king Robert II. and
III.</P>
<P>, This lord was a man of great honour, and
integrity, and his behaviour in the parliaments
1681 and 1685 showed him to be a strenu∣ous
defender of the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>testant religion.</P>
<P>He was a great promoter of the revolution
in 1688, and was very active, at the conven∣tion
of estates of Scotland, to get the crown
settled upon the prince and princess of Orange,
and had the command of a troop of horse in
their service at the battle of Killiecrankie in
1689.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of king William and
queen Mary to the crown, he was appointed
one of their privy-council, and soon after one
of the commissioners for executing the office
of lord-register.</P>
<P>He was likewise, by queen Anne, consti∣tuted
one of the lords of her privy-council,
and one of the commissioners of the treasury,
all which offices he executed with honour and
integrity.</P>
<P>In the parliament 1706, he strenuously
opposed the union of the two kingdoms, con∣ceiving
it derogatory to the honour of his
country.</P>
<P>Upon that great occasion he made several
learned and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laborate speeches, which are still
preserved, and show the uprightness of his
heart, that nothing could prevail with him
to concur with the court in a measure that he
judged to be inconsistent with the interest and
independency of his country, for which posterity
do him the justice to celebrate his name with
honour, as a patriot, as well as an orator.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, <HI>anno</HI> 1708, and,
by the said Margaret Hamilton, left issue two
sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Hamilton,</HI> Esq; advocate, assist∣ant
solicitor to the two boards of customs and
excise. This gentleman married Anne, daugh∣ter
of John Walkingshaw of that ilk, who
died without issue in 1732.</P>
<P>John, second lord Belhaven, was succccd∣ed
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IX. JOHN, third lord Belhaven, who was
a man of good parts, great, worth and merit.</P>
<P>He was chosen one of the sixteen peers for
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1715, and a lord of the bed-chamber
to George then prince of Wales,
afterwards king George II.</P>
<P>He had the command of a troop of horse,
raised by the county of Haddington, in the
time of the rebellion 1715, and served as a
volunteer at the battle of Dumblain, where
he gave distinguishing proofs of his valour and
intrepidity.</P>
<P>In 1721 he was appointed governor of Bar∣badoes,
but unfortunately perished at sea, in
the beginning of his voyage thither, in the
Royal Anne galley, near the Lizard Point,
where the ship having struck on the Stag
rocks, about midnight, was staved in pieces,
and, of two hundred and forty persons, only
two men and a boy were saved, being drove
ashore on pieces of the wreck.</P>
<P>He married Mary, daughter of Andrew
Bruce, merchant in Edinburgh, a cadet o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the

sons and one daughter.</P>

himself to a military life, was a major in the
expedition to America, under the late lord
Cathcart, and died a batchelor soon after his
return from Carthagena.</P>
<P>His daughter <HI>Margaret,</HI> was married to
Alexander Baird, Esq; son to sir William

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>

<P>V. WALTER, only son of the second
marriage of sir John Stewart of Minto, de∣signed
commendator of Blantyre, was a man
of great accomplishments, both natural and ac∣quired,
and having been bred; with king
James VI. under that famous scholar George
Buchanan, was always in favour and greatly
esteemed by his majesty.</P>
<P>He got charters, under the great seal,
<HI>Waltero,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. inter 1587 &amp; 1595.</NOTE> <HI>commendatorio de Blantyre,</HI> of all
the lordships, baronies, regalities, offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which belonged to the episcopal see of Glas∣gow,
with many other lands and baronies.</P>
<P>In the year 1580, when but a young man,
he was made one of the gentlemen of the bed-chamber
to the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the officers of state, and Stuart's hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> and one of his privy-council;
one of the senators of the college of
justice, and lord privy-seal, <HI>anno</HI> 1582; one
of the octavians of exchequer in 1595, and
lord high treasurer of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1596;
all which high offices he discharged with ho∣nour
and reputation.</P>
<P>The preamble to the grant of the office of
treasurer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. 6to Martii 1596.</NOTE> <HI>Waltero, commendatorio de Blantyre,</HI>
contains many honourable clauses, shows the
particular esteem and regard his majesty had
for him, and is fully narrated in the lives of
the officers of state.</P>
<P>We must here observe what is alledged by
former authors, that he was not created a peer
till the 10th of July 1606; but this must be a
mistake, for he was certainly raised to that
dignity at least seven years sooner, though
we have not seen the patent. This appears
from a charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad ann. 1598.</NOTE> under the great seal, erecting
all his lands, therein mentioned, into one free
barony, to be called the lordship and barony
of Blantyre for ever, and is expresly granted,

<HEAD>BORTHWICK Lord BORTHWICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE traditional accounts of the origin of
this antient family are various. Some
say, they are descended of one Andreas, a son
of the lord of the castle of Burtick in Livo∣nia,
who accompanied queen Margaret from
Hungary to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's ge∣nealogical collections, vol. II.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1057, and got
possession of some lands in the south or west
parts of this country, and that his posterity
assumed their sirname of Borthwick from the
place from whence this Andreas came: Others
are of opinion, that it is a local sirname.</P>
<P>It is evident, from our histories, that they
were long a great, numerous, and flourishing
family in Scotland; they had large possessions
in lands; and the noble alliances they made,
by their frequent marriages with the greatest
families in the kingdom, sufficiently appear
from the following narration: We shall there∣fore
deduce their descent, by unquestionable
authority, from</P>
<P>I. THOMAS de BORTHWICK, who ob∣tained
some lands near Lauder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> dom. Andre∣am Lauder de Fountainhall, Bart.</NOTE> in the shire of
Berwick, from Robert Lander of Quarrel∣wood,
in the reign of king David II. who
succeeded to the crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI>

<P>He lest issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>II. Sir WILLIAM de BORTHWICK, who
was in possession of the lands of Catkune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mr. Sinclair de Herdman∣ston.</NOTE> in
the reign of king Robert II▪ which appears
from a charter dated in 1378.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI>—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William Abernethy,
ancestor of lord Abernethy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> of Salton, who
was designed, <HI>Filia domini Willielmi de Borth∣wick

<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>III. Sir WILLIAM BORTHWICK, who
was witness in a charter of James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Queensberry.</NOTE> second earl
of Douglas, to his son sir William Douglas,
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
of the lands and barony of Drumlanrig, <HI>&amp;c.
circa annum</HI> 1387.</P>
<P>He was one of the guarantees of a treaty
of peace with the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VIII. p. 54.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1398, and
died soon thereafter, leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI>—and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Janet,</HI> married, 1st, to James Dou∣glas,
lord Dalkeith; 2dly, to George Crich∣ton,
earl of Caithness.</P>
<P>2.—, married to sir John Oliphant.</P>
<P>IV. Sir WILLIAM succeeded, and was
designed <HI>Willielmus de Borthwick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>dominus
de eodem, miles,</HI> in several authentic writs.</P>
<P>Before this family acquired the lands of
Borthwick, they were promiscuously designed
by the titles of Catkune, Legertwood, and
Heriotmuir, but were afterwards designed
Borthwicks of that ilk.</P>
<P>This sir William was a man of great parts,
was often employed in negotiations of impor∣tance,
and was concerned in most of the pu∣blic
transactions of his time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VIII. p. 185.</NOTE> He was one of
the commissioners appointed to treat with the

<P>He was again appointed one of the com∣missioners
for prolonging the truce <HI>anno</HI> 1404,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 369.</NOTE>
and obtained a safe conduct to treat with the
English about other matters, particularly with
the earls of Fife and Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 389, 411 &amp; 417.</NOTE> then prisoners
in England, <HI>anno</HI> 1405.</P>

of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 584.</NOTE> <HI>Willielmo de Borthwick, de Le∣gertwood,

<P>And got a charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> from Robert duke of
Albany, governor of Scotland, of the lands
and barony of Borthwick, in the shire of Sel∣kirk,
which formerly belonged to Robert
Scot, dated 4th day of June 1410.</P>
<P>He was again one of the ambassadors ap∣pointed
to the court of England in the years
1411 and 1413.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VIII. p. 703, and tom. IX. p. 45.</NOTE></P>
<P>Also, in the year 1421, to treat about the
king's liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. X. p. 125.</NOTE> which is the first time we find
him designed <HI>dominus de Borthwick.</HI></P>
<P>He was one of the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> that
sat on the assize of the duke of Lennox and
Murdoch duke of Albany's two sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 484.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1424.</P>
<P>This William appears to have been created
lord Borthwick before the year 1430; for,
in October that year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 490.</NOTE> at the baptism of the
king's two sons, there were several knights
created, and, amongst the rest, William, son
and heir of William lord Borthwick, was one.</P>
<P>He obtained, from king James I. a licence
to build a castle upon the lands of Lochwarret,

A stately castle was accordingly built, called
Borthwick castle, which afterwards became
the chief seat and title of the family.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>V. WILLIAM, second lord Borthwick,
who made a considerable figure when but a
young man. He was one of the hostages for
king James I.'s ransom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. X. p. 344 and 348.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1424; and hav∣ing
got liberty to return to his own country,
we find him appointed one of the ambassadors
to the court of Rome, <HI>anno</HI> 1425; but it seems
he had again returned prisoner to England; for
it appears he only obtained his liberty <HI>anno</HI>
1427,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 369.</NOTE> and had the honour of knighthood con∣ferred
upon him <HI>anno</HI> 1430, as before observed.</P>
<P>This lord was also a man of knowledge in
state affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament▪</NOTE> sat in the first parliament held by
king James II. <HI>anno</HI> 1437, and in several other
parliaments afterwards.</P>

<P>I. FRISKINUS de MORAVIA made a

<HEAD>HEPBURN Earl of BOTHWELL.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the general opinion of our antiquaries
that this is a local sirname taken from the
lands and barony of Hebborne, or Hayborne,
in the county of Northumberland, where
there were several considerable families of
that sirname in very early times; and Ralph
Heborne is mentioned as proprietor of these
lands as late as the reign of king Charles II.
and probably his posterity still continue there.</P>
<P>Though the Hepburns made a much great∣er
figure in Scotland than ever they did in
England, yet the precise time of their arri∣val
here is uncertain. The first of them we
find upon record is,</P>
<P>I. ADAM HEBBURN, who remarkably di∣stinguished
himself in Scotland in the reign of
king Robert Bruce, with whom he was in
great favour, and obtained from that Prince
a charter of the lands of south and north
Hales, and Traprene, in the shire of Had∣dingtoun,
upon the forfeiture of Hugh Gour∣lay
of Beinstone.</P>
<P>As also another charter of the lands of
Mordington,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inventary of old authentic writs, &amp;c. in the advocates library, Edr.</NOTE> Ronaldstoun, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the shire
of Berwick, all holding of Patrick Dunbar,
earl of March, and lying within that earl∣dom.</P>
<P>This Adam Hebburn gave a charter of
some lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 237.</NOTE> lying in the village of Mording∣ton,
to John Renton burgess of Berwick, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1320.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Patrick.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>John Hebburn,</HI> who obtained from Pa∣trick
Dunbar, earl of March, the lands of
Over and Nether Merkhill in East Lothian,
which is confirmed by king David II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chivis regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> David.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>

of the family of Waughton, from which

Beinstone, Humbie, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Adam was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>

intrepidity and resolution, and eminently
signalized themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 406.</NOTE> at the famous battle of
Otterburn, betwixt James earl of Douglas,
and Henry Percy, eldest son to the earl of
Northumberland, the 5th of August 1388.</P>
<P>III. Sir PATRICK HEBBURN younger of
Hales, a man of great honour, courage, and
intrepidity, married a daughter and one of
the co-heiresses of the <HI>de Vallibus,</HI> or Vauses,
lords of Dirleton, in the shire of Haddington,
by whom he got a great accession to his estate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, and Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>

<P>He was likeways in great savour with king
James VII. was one of his privy council, and
served him faithfully while he continued on

there appeared no further hopes of his re∣turning,
the great love and affection he had

a firm friend to the present establishment,
both in church and state. He was one of the
privy council to King William; also to Queen
Anne, who appointed him one of the com∣missioners
of exchequer, and governor of the
castle of Blackness.</P>
<P>In the parliament 1706, he strennously op∣posed
the union, believing it to be inconsist∣ent
with the honour and independency of
Scotland; and when he found it would be
concluded in spite of all the opposition it met
with, he entered a solemn protest against it,
which, being still upon record, shows the sin∣cere
attachment he had to what he thought
the ancient privileges of his native country.
Soon thereafter, he was removed from all his
places of public trust: But, upon the accessi∣on
of King George I. to the crown, he was
appointed one of the commissioners of trade
and police, lord-lieutenant of the counties of
Stirling and Clackmannan, and was elected
one of the sixteen Scotch peers to the three
succeeding British parliaments, <HI>viz.</HI> 1715,
1722, and 1727.</P>

<P>ALL our historians agree, that the sir∣name

<P>It is needless to trouble our readers with
more examples of the antiquity of the name
of Scot; and as we cannot positively ascer∣tain
the first ancestor of the house of Buck∣cleugh,
we shall take the succession of the
first four generations from a M. S. history of
that family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family of Buccleugh, penes M'Far∣farlane.</NOTE> written by a good antiquary, who
had perused their old writs, the connection
whereof is submitted to the judgment of our
readers, and is as follows:</P>
<P>1. UCHTREDUS filius SCOT, before men∣tioned,
was the progenitor of this illustrious
family, and from him all the Scots in Scot∣land
are descended.</P>
<P>This Uchtredus was witness to the foun∣dation-charters
of the Abbays of Holyrood∣house
and Selkirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal∣rymple's hist. coll. p. 225.</NOTE> by king David I. <HI>anno</HI>
1128 and 1130.</P>
<P>The author of the M. S. does not affirm
that this Uchtred had taken Scot for his sir∣name;
only, that being the son of a Scotsman,
he was designed filius Scot, to distinguish him
from other Uchtreds, which was a numerous
christian name in Scotland about that time.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>II. RICHARD, who certainly assumed the
sirname of Scot, and lived in the reigns of
king Malcolm IV. and king William the lion.</P>
<P>Richardus Scot is witness to a charter of
Robert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> bishop of St. Andrews, to the abbacy
of Holyroodhouse. This Robert, who found∣ed
the priory of St. Andrews, died <HI>anno</HI> 1158;
so the charter, which has no date, must have
been granted in or before that year.</P>
<P>This Richard is said to have had two sons,
Richard and Michael: which was the eldest
we shall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> carried on the line of this family,
and</P>
<P><HI>Michael</HI> was the undoubted ancestor of the
Scots of Balweary, and had considerable pos∣sessions
in lands about Dumfermline before
the year 1200,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Dumfermline penes Mac∣Farlane.</NOTE> particularly the lands of Gas∣cumemefen, <HI>&amp;c Vide</HI> vol. II. of this work.</P>

to the abbacy of Kelso, of eight acres of land,
<HI>pro salute animae suae, &amp;c.</HI></P>

to a charter of Thomas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Coldinghame penes eund. p. 169.</NOTE> prior of Colding∣hame,

1503,</P>
<P>He accompanied king James IV. to the fa∣tal
field of Floudon, where he remarkably di∣stinguished
himself; and tho' he had the good
fortune to come off the field alive, where he
left many of his brave countrymen dead, yet
he did not long survive it, but died in 1516,
having married Elizabeth, daughter of Walter
Ker of Cessford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Buckcleugh.</NOTE> widow of Philip Rutherford,
son and apparent heir of James Rutherford of
that ilk, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>XIV. Sir WALTER SCOT of Branxholm
and Buckcleugh, who was served heir to his
father on 27th October 1517.</P>
<P>All our historians agree, that this sir Wal∣ter
was a man of intrepid valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. &amp; chart. inpub. archiv.</NOTE> magnanimi∣ty
and courage, and performed many brave
actions in the service of his country, in the
minority of king James V.</P>
<P>After that prince begun to take the ma∣nagement
of affairs into his own hands, he
thought himself too much confined, and kept
little better than a prisoner by the earl of An∣gus;
wherefore he sent a private message to
sir Walter Scot of Buckcleugh, then one of
the greatest men in the south of Scotland, to
try to relieve him.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="111"/>
Buckcleugh, being informed that the king
and the earl were coming to Melross with a
considerable train of attendants, raised about
1000 horse of his friends and followers, in
order to rescue his majesty; but Angus hav∣ing
intelligence of his design, was well pre∣pared
to receive him. They came in sight
of one another near Melross, soon came to
blows, and a bloody conflict ensued, where
several men of rank fell on both sides, but
the earl of Angus had the better.</P>
<P>On his side the brave sir Andrew Ker of
Cessford was killed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan, &amp; M. S. hist. of the family of Buckcleugh, p. 20.</NOTE> which afterwards occasi∣oned
great feuds betwixt the Kers and the
Scots. Sir Walter himself was wounded, and
narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. This
action happened on the 18th July 1526.</P>
<P>Tho' the attempt was not attended with
success, yet the king always retained a grate∣ful
sense of what sir Walter intended to have
done for him, and he continued to be in high
favour with his majesty as long as he lived.</P>
<P>After queen Mary's accession to the crown,
he strenuously opposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and greatly suppressed
the insurrections on the borders; and the de∣feat
of the English army, under the command
of sir Ralph Ewers and Bryan Stapleton at
Ancrum-hills, was chiefly owing to the pru∣dent
conduct of sir Walter Scot, <HI>anno</HI> 1544.</P>
<P>He got a charter of the lands of Deloraine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
and others, <HI>Waltero Scot de Branxholm, mili∣ti,
anno</HI> 1545.</P>
<P>He remarkably signalized his valour and
courage at the battle of Pinkie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1547;
upon which he got from the queen the estate
of Henderland, upon the forfeiture of sir John
Cockburn, and was made warden of the west
marches towards England, in which office he
did his country signal service.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Margaret, daughter of
—Carmichael of that ilk, ancestor of the
earl of Hyndford, by whom he had three sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>David,</HI> who died before his father,
without issue.</P>

<HI>anno</HI> 1574, and afterward was de∣puty
for the province of Zealand. His grand∣son,
Apollonius Scot, was president of the
high court of justice at the Hague; and it is
said his family still subsists in Holland, and carry
the arms of the family of Buckcleugh, with a
suitable difference.</P>
<P>Sir Walter married, 2dly, Janet, daughter

<P>XV. Sir WALTER, designed of Kirkurd,
son and apparent heir of sir Walter Scot of

daughter of John Bethune of Creich, sister
to his father's second wife, by whom he had
a son,</P>

who succeeded also to his grandfather in 1552,
to whom he was served heir, <HI>anno</HI> 1553.</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and fine
accomplishments, a firm and steady friend of
queen Mary.</P>
<P>He, with—Ker of Ferny hirst, in hopes
that embroiling matters with England might
serve the queen's party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> made several incursi∣ons
into the borders about the year 1572,
and also endeavoured to take possession of the
town of Jedburgh for her majesty.</P>
<P>In 1574, sir Walter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's me∣moirs, &amp; M. S. of the family.</NOTE> with lord Claud Ha∣milton,
and others, surprised the earl of Len∣nox,
and eleven or twelve of the chief nobili∣ty,
at Stirling, whom they had almost carri∣ed
off prisoners, but were prevented by their
own men being too intent upon the plunder.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding his firm adherence to
the queen's interest, yet he always maintain∣ed
a fair character, even with those of the op∣posite
party.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad an∣num 1574.</NOTE> daugh∣ter

was knighted, assisted at the coronation
of queen Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 60.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1590, and was made

<P>XX. Lady ANNE SCOT, who, in 1665,
was married to James <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itzroy duke of Mon∣mouth,
eldest natural son of king Charles II.
by Lucy daughter of Richard Walters of Ha∣verford,
in the county of Pembroke, Esq;
Upon which marriage he took the name of
Scot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Buckcleugh, et chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and they were created duke and dut∣chess
of Buckcleugh, by letters patent to
their heirs whatsoever, dated 20th April
1673.</P>
<P>As the life and fatal end of the duke is
fully set forth in many different histories, we
shall here only mention some of the most re∣markable
particulars.</P>
<P>He was born at Rotterdam in 1649, and
was bred chiefly at Paris, under the eye of
the queen-mother. He had a fine person,
and a most graceful behaviour, and was a
great favourite of his father, who not only
bestowed on him many great and lucrative
posts, but was instrumental in procuring him
the above marriage, which at that time was
one of the greatest in the kingdom.</P>
<P>He came to England in 1662, was creat∣ed
baron of Tyndale, earl of Doncaster, duke
of Monmouth, and knight of the garter in
1663; and the next session of parliament he
took his seat in the house of peers.</P>
<P>In 1665, he was made captain of the
the king's life guards of horse, captain-gene∣ral
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
of the king's forces, and had many other
instances of the royal bounty and favour.
His brave and gallant behaviour in the wars
abroad, gained him the reputation of an able
general.</P>
<P>In 1679, there happened an insurrection
in Scotland, after the murder of archbishop
Sharp, which was raised by the presbyteri∣ans,
in hopes of overturning episcopacy:
The duke had the command of the king's
troops, and fought and defeated the rebels at
Bothwell-bridge, which put an end to that
rebellion.</P>
<P>He afterwards became very popular, espe∣cially
with the discontented party, and those
who were against the duke of York's succes∣sion
to the crown, who thought of nothing
less than making the duke of Monmouth
king; and though the duke had been guilty
of some very suspicious practices, yet, upon
his submission, the king was pleased to par∣don
him.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter, being again banish∣ed
the court, he retired to Holland, where he
stayed till the king's death in 1684.</P>
<P>In May 1685, being persuaded to attempt
the crown, he invaded the country, from
Holland, with seven or eight hundred officers
and men; landed at Lyme in Dorsetshire;
and emitted a manifesto or declaration, set∣ing
forth, <Q REND="inline">"That he came in defence of the
protestant religion, the laws, rights, and
privileges of England, and invited all
people to join him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The king, being informed of all these pro∣ceedings,
acquainted his parliament; where∣upon
both houses voted an address of thanks
to his majesty, and the commons ordered in
a bill to attaint the duke of high treason,
which passed accordingly.</P>
<P>In the mean time, great numbers of people
flocked into his army from all hands, and at
Bridgewater, and other places, he was pro∣claimed
king.</P>
<P>The earl of Feversham commanded the
king's troops, which were then encamped at
Sedge-muir. On the 6th July, at four in
the morning, the duke, with his army,
thought fit to attack him; but they being
upon their guard, gave them such a warm
reception, that the duke's army was entire∣ly
routed, and himself taken prisoner.</P>
<P>He was beheaded on Tower-hill the 15th
July 1685, leaving issue by the said dutchess
of Buckcleugh, four sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of Doncaster, born in 1672,
and died young.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> born in 1674, who, after his
father's attainder, was called earl of Dalkeith,
and carried on the line of this family.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Henry,</HI> born in 1676, created earl of
Deloraine.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Francis,</HI> born in 1678, and died young.</P>

Buckcleugh, in May 1688, married to Charles
lord Cornwallis, by whom she had a son,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> who died young,—and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who also died young.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Isabella.</HI></P>
<P>The dutchess died in 1732, in the eighty-first
year of her age,</P>
<P>XXI. JAMES, earl of Dalkeith, son of the
duke of Monmouth, and dutchess of Buck∣cleugh,
married lady Henriet Hyde, daughter
of Laurence earl of Rochester, by whom he
had three sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Francis,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> who died young.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Henry,</HI> who also died young.</P>
<P>His daughters, lady <HI>Anne</HI> and lady <HI>Char∣lotte,</HI>
died unmarried.</P>
<P>He was made knight of the thistle in 1703,
and dying in 1704, was succeeded by his
son,</P>
<P>XXII. FRANCIS, earl of Dalkeith, who
was made knight of the thistle in 1724, and
succeeded to the honours and title of duke of
Buckcleugh, upon the death of his grandmo∣ther
the dutchess, <HI>anno</HI> 1732, and was chosen
one of the sixteen peers for Scotland to the
next <HI>British</HI> parliament.</P>
<P>In 1743, he was restored to two of the
duke of Monmouth's titles, by act of parlia∣ment,
<HI>viz.</HI> earl of Doncaster, and baron Scot
of Tyndale, by which he became a British
peer.</P>
<P>In 1720, he married lady Jane Douglas,
daughter of James duke of Queensberry, by
whom he had two sons and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Francis,</HI> earl of Dalkeith.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> who died unmarried at Oxford,

<P>It appears from our histories, that the Bal∣sours
were a very numerous and flourishing
family in Fife in the reign of king David
Bruce, when Johannes de Balfour, <HI>dominus de
eodem, miles,</HI> died without sons, and left only
one daughter, Margaret, his sole heiress, who
married <HI>dominus Robertus de Bethune familia∣ris
regis Roberti II.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Bal∣four's annals. Sir Rob. Sib∣bald, Craw∣furd, &amp;c.</NOTE> who thereby got posses∣sion
of the barony and mannor of Balfour,
which his posterity still enjoys, but he re∣tained
the name of Bethune, and of him se∣veral
families of that sirname are descended.</P>
<P>And though there are many considerable
families of the name of Balfour in Scotland
at this day, yet we must here confine our∣serves
to the families of Burleigh and Mont∣whanie,

<P>The ancestor of the family of Burleigh ap∣pears
to have been,</P>

<P>The first of the other family was sir Mi∣chael
Balfour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Char. penes magist. Cal∣derwood de Polton.</NOTE> who obtained the lands of
Montwhanie, in exchange for the lands of
Pittencriess, by a charter from king David

lineally descended sir James Balfour of Mont∣whanie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. inter 1400 et 1550.</NOTE>

<HEAD>Earl of CAITHNESS.</HEAD>
<P>SOME historians say, that this title is of
very great antiquity, and mention one
Duncan earl of Caithness, in the reign of king
Kenneth III. but as we have no documents of
any earls in Scotland for several ages after that
aera, we shall pass by these traditional accounts,
and proceed to our documents.</P>
<P>The first we find upon record, who enjoy∣ed
this title, was one</P>
<P>I. MACWILLIAM, who was designed
earl of Caithness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Dumfermline and Martin's genealogical collections, p. 169.</NOTE> in a charter granted by king
David I. to the monastery of Dunfermline,
the fifth year of his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1129. He liv∣ed
till about 1160, and was succeeded by his
son,</P>
<P>II. HAROLD, whom Spottiswood calls earl
of Orkney and Caithness. He was a very wick∣ed
and turbulent man, and committed vast cru∣elties
against John bishop of Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Spottis∣wood's Ch. hist. &amp; chron. of Melross.</NOTE> for which
he was deservedly punished by king William,
<HI>anno</HI> 1179, and his estate and honours forfeit∣ed
to the crown.</P>
<P>The next who enjoyed this title, was</P>
<P>I. MAGNUS, son of Gilibred earl of An∣gus,
upon whom king Alexander II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalrymple's collections.</NOTE> bestow∣ed
that title, <HI>anno</HI> 1222.</P>
<P>He was also designed <HI>Magnus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Arbroath, p. 18.</NOTE> <HI>filius comitis
Anegus, &amp;c. anno</HI> 1227.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>II. MALCOLM,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's ge∣nealogical collections.</NOTE> earl of Caithness, of whom
we have nothing memorable, but that he was
succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>III. JOHN, earl of Caithness, who was one
of the Scotch nobles that swore fealty to king
Edward I. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's hist. vol. III.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>He had issue one daughter, <HI>Isabel;</HI> and hav∣ing
no sons, the honours again returned to
the crown.</P>
<P>He died about the year 1330, and his
daughter <HI>Isabel</HI> married to William earl of
Ross,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Su∣therland and Crawfurd's Peerage.</NOTE> to whom she had only two daughters.
1. <HI>Eupham,</HI> afterwards countess of Ross. 2.
<HI>Isabel,</HI> married to Alexander Frazer of Phi∣lorth.</P>
<P>This title continued in the crown till king
Robert II. bestowed it upon his own son Da∣vid,
(by queen Eupham Ross) whom he cre∣ated
earl of Strathern and Caithness upon his
accession to the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1371; but he dy∣ing
without male succession, both these titles
devolved upon his brother Walter, earl of A∣thole;
and he resigned the title of Caithness
in favours of his son Alan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hawthorden, Crawford, Stewart, &amp;c.</NOTE> who was killed at
<PB N="112" REF="121"/>
the battle of Inverlochie <HI>anno</HI> 1428, or, ac∣cording
to others, in 1431; and he having no
male-issue, the title of Caithness returned to
his father, which, upon his forfeiture, came
again to the crown.</P>

<HEAD>DALZIEL Earl of CARNWATH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS noble family is of great antiquity
in the shire of Lanark, where they flou∣rished,
and matched with several of the most
considerable families, before they settled in
Dumfries-shire, where they now have their
chief residence.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that this is a local
sirname,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks up∣on Ragman's roll, p. 45.</NOTE> and was first assumed by the posses∣sors
of the lands and barony of Dalziel; but,</P>
<P>The account of their origin, given by Mr.
Nisbet, and other historians, is, that in the
reign of king Kenneth II. a kinsman, and fa∣vourite
of that king, being taken prisoner by
the Picts, was put to death, and hung up up∣on
a gallows in view of the Scotch camp.
King Kenneth being highly provoked and in∣censed
at the affront, offered a considerable
reward to any of his subjects who would take
down, and carry off the corpse; but, for some
time, none would venture to undertake the
dangerous enterprise. At last, a gentleman
of more spirit and courage than the rest, said
<HI>dal zell,</HI> which, in the old Scotch language,
signifies, <HI>I dare.</HI> He effectually performed
it to the king's satisfaction, who accordingly
rewarded him nobly. His posterity assumed
the word DALZELL for their sirname, and
that remarkable bearing of a man hanging on
a gallows for their arms, with <HI>I dare</HI> for their
motto, in memory of the above brave action,
though they now bear only a naked man pro∣per.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the great antiquity of
this noble family, the first of them we find
upon record is,</P>
<P>I. Sir THOMAS de DALZELL, who was
one of the great barons that swore sealty to
king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. vol. III. p. 662.</NOTE> of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>He was afterwards one of these worthy
patriots who joined king Robert Bruce; and
always continued steady in his interest till his
death.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>

succeeded him, and was a faithful subject, and

<HEAD>BRUCE Lord of ANNANDALE and Earl of CARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>HAD the name of BRUCE been distin∣guished
by no other person but the
great and immortal king Robert, he alone is
sufficient, not only to ennoble a name but a
nation: but, to his glory and renown, we
have that of other kings, and other heroes to
be added, to raise this family to the highest
pitch of grandeur amongst the illustrious hou∣ses
of the Scotch nobility.</P>
<P>We shall therefore deduce their descent
from the Norman conquest of England, which,
we presume, was their first settlement in this
island.</P>
<P>Amongst the great number of noble and
valiant Normans, that came over to England
with William the Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066,
none made a greater figure than Robert de
Bruce, the undoubted ancestor of this family.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="138"/>
I. ROBERT BRUIS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nobilis miles de Normand. Monasticon Anglicnum, v. II. p. 146. in bibl. jurid. Edin.</NOTE> (or Bruce,) whom
sir William Dugdale calls a noble knight of
Normandy, seems to have had no small share
in the conquest of England.</P>
<P>And as William divided the conquered
lands amongst those of his followers, who had
most remarkably distinguished themselves for
conduct and bravery, so none appears to have
got so large a share as this Robert de Bruis;
for both Scotch and English historians agree,
that he got possession of the castle and ma∣nor
of Skelton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrom∣bie's hist. Dugdales ba∣ronage. Mon. anglic. where most of his lands are par∣ticularly men∣tioned.</NOTE> (which became the chief title
of his family) with above ninety lordships in
the east, west, and north Ridings of Yorkshire,
whereof Gysburn in Cleveland, (which we
shall have occasion often to mention hereaf∣ter,)
was one.</P>
<P>This Robert died about the year 1100,
(some say <HI>anno</HI> 1094,) and left issue a son
and successor.</P>
<P>II. ROBET de BRUIS, second lord of Skel∣ton,
a man of great worth and honour, who,
having contracted a friendship with king
David I. while he resided in England, and
his lady being then dead, by whom he had a
son and heir, he came to Scotland with Da∣vid,
who was a generous prince, and always
conferred his favours upon persons of merit.</P>
<P>We shall observe, that during the reign of
king Alexander I. his brother David was de∣signed
<HI>comes,</HI> and prince of Cumberland,
and was superior of the whole lordship of An∣nandale.
He was also earl of Northumber∣land,
Huntington,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal∣rymple's col. p. 168. and 176.</NOTE> and Northampton, in right
of his wife Mathilda, which is fully docu∣mented
from the register of the episcopal see
of Glasgow.</P>
<P>That Robert de Bruis came to Scotland
with David, and was accounted one of his
nobles or vassals, is clear from the said regi∣ster
of Glasgow, where <HI>comes</HI> David gives
<HI>centum solidorum in</HI> Hardingestra (in North∣ampton-shire)
for repairing the church of
Glasgow. The original writ bears, <Q REND="inline">"with

inter ann.</HI> 1120, and 1124."</Q></P>
<P>This alone is sufficient proof of Robert's
being in Scotland with David. It is no less
certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Register of the church of Glasgow, cir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iter ann. 1120.</NOTE> that he got possession of the lordship
of Annandale, of which there are many do∣cuments:
and it is affirmed by some histori∣ans,
that king David procured him in mari∣riage
Agnes Annand, heiress to the rich lord∣ship
of Annandale, which contained all the
lands from the bounds of Dunegal and Strath∣nith,
to the lands of Ranulph de Meschines,
then earl of Chester, and lord of Cumber∣land,
which king David confirmed to him,
whereby he came to have large possessions
both in Scotland and in England.</P>
<P>And being a man of great parts, and equal∣ly
qualified for the cabinet and the field, was
long in high favour both with king David I.
of Scotland, and king Henry I. of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>In the year 1137, Robert, being at the
court of England, king Stephen joined him
in commission with Bernard de Baliol, to en∣deavour
to dissuade or divert king David of
Scotland from his intended invasion of Eng∣land,
for which Robert used all his interest;
but David, either neglecting or despising the
advice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal∣rymple and Sir William Dugdale.</NOTE> pursued his former resolutions, and en∣tered
England with a considerable army. Up∣on
which Robert withdrew his allegiance from
David for his lands he held of him in Scotland,
and was on the English side at the battle of
Standard <HI>anno</HI> 1138,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monasticon Angli. vol. II. p. 146.</NOTE> where he took prisoner
his own son Robert, whom he had left in
Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nutrici suae custodiendum emendavit, &amp;c.</NOTE> and was then about 14 years of
age. When his father presented him to the
king of England, he desired him to deliver
him to his nurse to be taken care of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. II. p. 448.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir William Dugdale says, he was more
sit to be eating wheat bread with his mother,
than by force of arms to be defending his
patrimony of Annandale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>However, the year thereafter a peace was
concluded upon very honourable terms for
Scotland, Northumberland having been de∣livered
up to prince Henry, and Robert con∣tinued
in friendship and favour with king
David ever after.</P>
<P>He was very liberal in his donations to the
religious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monast. Angl. Charta funda∣tionis priora∣tus de Gys∣burn.</NOTE> having in 29th of Henry I. <HI>anno</HI>

<P>The male line of Adam de Bruce, eldest

<P>He obtained also from king Henry II. of
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdales's baronage of Eng. v. II. p. 449.</NOTE> the privilege of a weekly market,

<P>And to show that he looked upon his chief

<P>He confirmed the donations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Glasgow.</NOTE> which had
been formerly given by his father to the
monks of Gysburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal∣rymple's coll. &amp;c.</NOTE> of all the churches with∣in

<P>And dying before 1183, was succeeded
by his son,</P>
<P>IV. ROBERT de BRUCE, third lord of An∣nandale,
a man of great valour and magna∣nimity,
and at the same time both pious and
religious.</P>
<P>He ratified and confirmed to the abbacy
of Gysburn all the grants of his predecessors
in these words: <HI>Sciatis me confirmasse Deo et

<P>He entered into an agreement with Joce∣line
bishop of Glasgow, with consent of the

<P>Robert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalrymple's appendix, p. 353.</NOTE> third lord of Annandale, died <HI>an∣no</HI>
1191, and was succeeded by his only son,</P>
<P>V. ROBERT de BRUCE, fourth lord of
Annandale, who, on account of his great va∣lour
and merit, was sirnamed the Noble.</P>
<P>He married lady Isabel, second daughter of
prince David, earl of Huntington and Ches∣ter,
son of Henry prince of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun and all Scotch hi∣storians.</NOTE> eldest
son of king David I. brother of king Malcolm
IV. and king William the Lyon, by which
royal marriage the Bruces of Annandale came
to be among the greatest subjects in Europe;
for by this lady (who was one of the three
sisters and co-heiresses of John, sirnamed
Scot, earl of Huntington, and last count pa∣latine
of Chester, whose only daughter Maud,
had been married to prince David) besides
their paternal estates in both kingdoms, Ro∣bert
came to be possessed of the manors of
Uritile and Hatfield, in exchange for those
lands that descended to his lady, by the death
of the earls palatine her brothers, three
whereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England. Rymer's foed.</NOTE> Henry, David, and John, died
without issue, she also brought him the
lordship of Garioch in Scotland, and the ma∣nors
of Connington and Exton in England.</P>
<P>He died in an advanced age, <HI>anno</HI> 1245,
and was interred with his ancestors in the ab∣bay
of Gysburn, under a stately monument,
leaving issue by the said lady Isabel a son and
successor,</P>
<P>VI. ROBERT de BRUCE, fifth Lord of
Annandale, who, together with John Cum∣min,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Dugdale, vol. II. 450. Sir Ja. Bal∣four, &amp;c.</NOTE>
were sent to England with auxiliaries,
to the assistance of king Henry III. against the
barons, and were both taken prisoners with
king Henry and prince Edward, <HI>anno</HI> 1264.</P>
<P>After the death of queen Margaret, daugh∣ter
of the king of Norway, grandchild and
undoubted heiress of king Alexander III. this
Robert claimed the crown in right of his
mother.</P>
<P>It was alledged, among many other argu∣ments
in his behalf, that it was customary in
Scotland for the brother of the last king to
be preferred before his son; and produced for
an example, that Donald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. Abercrom∣bie &amp;c.</NOTE> brother of Ken∣neth
Macalpine, attained the crown prefe∣rable
to Constantine, his brother Kenneth's
son.</P>
<P>That king Alexander II. (failing heirs of
his own body) looked upon Robert Bruce as
his heir, even to the knowledge of Dornagild,
his mother's elder sister, who was then alive,
and assented to it, at least did not contradict
it, having no male issue of her own.</P>
<P>And that it was a constant maxim in Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. tom. II. p. 542. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>
for the son of the second daughter to
be preferred to the heir female of the eldest
daughter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's coll. vol. III. p. 516, 517.</NOTE></P>
<P>And further, that king Alexander III. ac∣knowledged
this Robert to be next heir to
the crown, failing heirs of his own body; all
which he offered to prove by living witnesses.</P>
<P>But as that subject has been largely hand∣led
by several able historians, 'tis needless
to insist further on it here, since it is well
known how king Edward of England de∣termined
the controversy.</P>
<P>Robert, the competitor, married Isabel de
Clare, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, earl of
Glocester and Hartfield, by whom he had
three sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert de Bruce.</HI></P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Bernard Bruce,</HI> who got from his
father the lands of Connington in Hunting∣ton-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir William Dugdale's ba∣ronage of England.</NOTE>
and Exton in Rutland-shire, whose
male line failed in the end of the reign of
king Edward III.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John,</HI> ancestor of the Bruces of Clack∣mannan.
<HI>Vide</HI> Title <HI>Elgin</HI> and <HI>Kincardin.</HI></P>
<P>His daughter <HI>Christian,</HI> married to Patrick
Dunbar earl of March, one of the competi∣tors
for the crown.</P>
<P>As Robert Bruce thought that John Bali∣ol,
in the competition for the crown, was
unjustly preferred to him, so he could never
be prevailed upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baronage of England. Chron. Wal∣teri abbatis de Gysburn.</NOTE> either to give up his title,
or to acknowledge king Edward to be superi∣or,
or John Baliol to be king of Scotland,
but in great discontent retired to England,
where he did not remain long, but returned
to his castle of Lochmaben, where he died,
and was buried with his ancestors in the ab∣bay
of Gysburn, <HI>anno</HI> 1295.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VII. ROBERT de BRUCE, sixth lord of
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
Annandale, afterwards earl of Carrick, who,
in his younger years, together with Adam de
Kilconath (in right of his wife, earl of Car∣rick)
accompanied Edward prince of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He died in 1270, by the chron. of Melross, and in 1272. by Sir William Dugdale.</NOTE>
and king Lewis I. of France to the holy war,
where, by his courage and conduct, he gain∣ed
immortal honour, and where the earl of
Carrick died, <HI>anno</HI> 1272, as before noticed.</P>
<P>Robert, after his return, retired to Eng∣land,
where he had a considerable estate; and
though he never would submit to, or ac∣knowledge
John Baliol to be king of Scot∣land,
he continued in the English interest
for some time, and with his son Robert (af∣terwards
king of Scotland) contributed great∣ly
to the English gaining the battle of Dunbar
against the loyalists, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, countess of Carrick,
daughter and sole heiress of Neil earl of Car∣rick,
and widow of the foresaid Adam de Kil∣conath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chronicle of Melross.</NOTE>
earl of Carrick, in whose right he
also became earl of Carrick, and by her had
issue five sons and seven daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> afterwards king of Scot∣land.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Edward Bruce,</HI> a brave soldier, who
was very serviceable to his brother in his
wars against the English. He was king of
Ireland, and was killed at the battle of Dun∣dalk,
<HI>anno</HI> 1318.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb. and Stuart's history of the royal family.</NOTE> He left no lawful issue,

by king Edward, sent to London, and put

<P>The said Thomas and Alexander were
both taken prisoners by Duncan Macdougal in

<P>1. Daughter, lady <HI>Isabel,</HI> married, 1st, to

chamberlain of Scotland, whose son, Thomas
Randulph, earl of Murray, lord of Annandale
and the Isle of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several char∣ters in the public register.</NOTE> guardian of Scotland,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> was one of the greatest heroes of his time.

<P>7. Lady—,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> married to David lord

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1303, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>VIII. ROBERT BRUCE, earl of Carrick,
seventh lord of Annandale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In 1297, he joined sir William Wallace;
but having large possessions in England, he
submitted to king Edward, and fought against
the Scotch army at Falkirk, <HI>anno</HI> 1298, where
he had a memorable interview with sir Wil∣liam
Wallace, narrated at large by several
good historians.</P>
<P>In 1299, he revolted from king Edward,
and was made one of the guardians of Scot∣land,
but was again reconciled to Edward in
1304.</P>
<P>In 1305, he was employed by king Ed∣ward,
with some other Scotchmen, to settle
the disordered state of their country: the
following year he determined to assert his just
title to the crown, was joined by the loyal∣ists
or patriots, and crowned at Scoon on
palm-sunday, the 27th of March 1306.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he relieved, and entirely
redeemed his distressed country from the
usurpations and tyranny of a foreign power;
but as the great actions of this hero are ful∣ly
set forth, and recorded by many able hi∣storians,
and do not properly fall within the
plan of this work, we shall only add, that no
age or country ever produced a man of more
eminent qualities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie and all other Scotch histo∣rians.</NOTE> either for peace or war,
than the famous and renowned king Robert
Bruce.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Isabel, daughter of
Donald, and sister of Gratney, earl of Mar,
by whom he had lady Marjory, who was
married to Walter, lord high steward of Scot∣land,
then the greatest man in the kingdom.

Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and their daughter Egidia, or

<P><HI>David,</HI> his heir to the crown,—and
three daughters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pu∣blic. regist.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William earl of

<P>3. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes Mr. Oliphant of Gask.</NOTE> married to sir Walter Oli∣phant,

<P>King Robert had likeways a natural son,
called Robert Bruce, who was a brave and
gallant man, and highly esteemed by his fa∣ther,
who, in many charters, designs him
<HI>dilectus filius meus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes Mr. Lockhart of Lee.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He was also design∣ed
<HI>dominus de Liddel</HI> or Liddisdale; and it is
not improbable, that it was by his daughter
and heiress, that the estate and lordship of
Liddisdale came to that great patriot sir Wil∣liam
Douglas, <HI>dominus de</HI> Liddisdale.</P>
<P>This Robert was killed at the battle of
Duplin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, &amp;c.</NOTE> fighting in defence of his king and
country, <HI>anno</HI> 1332.</P>
<P>King Robert Bruce died in June 1329,
and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>IX. King DAVID BRUCE, who was not
then nine years of age. He was a prince en∣dowed
with many excellent qualities, of great
courage and conduct; yet he was not always
successful.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb.</NOTE> He retired to France after the
battle of Halidonhill, in 1333, where he re∣mained
till 1342.</P>
<P>After his return, he made several expedi∣tions
into England, (to make a diversion in
favour of the French) with very good success;
but, at the fatal battle of Durham, he was
wounded and taken prisoner, <HI>anno</HI> 1346.</P>
<P>He was detained long in England, though
many treaties were set on foot by his faithful
and loyal subjects for his liberty, which, at
last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. and all Scotch historians.</NOTE> was brought about, and accomplished for
a ransom of 100,000 merks Sterling, <HI>anno</HI>
1357.</P>
<P>And as the particular transactions of this
long reign are fully recorded by many histo∣rians,
to these we refer our readers.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Joanna or Jean, daughter
of king Edward II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autograph. penes com. de Errol, ad an∣num 1366.</NOTE> of England; 2dly, he
married the widow of sir John Logie of that
ilk; but died without issue in the castle of
Edinburgh, on 22d February 1371, which
ended the male-line of the body of king Ro∣bert
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawf. peer∣age, and hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> formerly earl of Carrick.</P>
<P>Upon king Robert's accession to the crown,
he bestowed the title of earl of Carrick upon
his valiant and faithful brother Edward king
of Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta in ro∣tul Roberti I.</NOTE> who was third earl of Carrick of
the Brucian race; and he being killed, as
above, without lawful issue, the king bestow∣ed
that earldom upon Edward's eldest natural
son, Robert Bruce, and his heirs-male, he be∣ing
fourth earl; and, as he was killed at the
battle of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI> 1332, without male-issue,
the earldom went to his brother,</P>
<P>ALEXANDER, fifth earl of Carrick, who
was killed at the battle of Halidonhill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. History of the royal family.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1333, leaving only one daughter,</P>

<P>THOMAS, earl of Carrick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stuart's hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> who joined
Robert Stewart, guardian of Scotland, in
1344, but died also without issue, whereby
the earldom of Carrick fell to the crown.</P>
<P>And as that title was never after conferred
upon any but the sons of our kings, till king
Charles I. bestowed it upon James lord Kin∣cleven,
we shall therefore briefly mention
those who enjoyed it.</P>
<P>I. JOHN STEWART, eldest son of king
Robert II. by Elizabeth More, his first wife,
was created earl of Carrick by king David
Bruce. He was afterwards king of Scotland,
by the name of king Robert III.</P>
<P>II. DAVID, prince of Scotland, and duke
of Rothsay, eldest son of king Robert III. was
created earl of Carrick by his father, but died

<P>That a family of rank and figure in Car∣rick,

their sirname from their being head or

by king Alexander III. the 27th year of his
reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1276; in which he is designed
<HI>Rolandus de Carrick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>filius Nicolai, filii Dun∣cani,
&amp;c.</HI> All which is fully narrated and
confirmed by king Robert II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno regni se∣cundo.</HI></P>
<P>This family, being evidently possessed of
a large estate, and head of a considerable
tribe or clan, began to be called Kennadies,
from the <HI>Galic</HI> or <HI>Celtic</HI> word Kean-na-ty,
which signifies head of the house, or chief of
the clan; and in that country the word Ken∣nady
is called Kennaty to this day.</P>
<P>There are several charters in the records,
wherein the same persons are designed Car∣rick
in the body, and Kennady on the mar∣gin,
in the reign of king Robert II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> by which
it is certain that Carrick and Kennady wete
promiscuously used by the heads of this fami∣ly
for a considerable time, though their ca∣dets
generally took the name of Kennady.</P>
<P>Roland was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir GILBERT de CARRICK, who,
in several authentic writs, is designed son of
Roland, particularly in a submission of a dif∣ference
betwixt him and the nuns of North∣berwick,
in which Robert Bruce, earl of Car∣rick,
father of king Robert Bruce, and Ro∣bert
bishop of Glasgow were arbiters. He is
therein designed <HI>Gilbertus de Carrick, miles,
filius Rolandi, &amp;c.</HI> and his seal, which is
thereto appended, hath the very same shield
of arms which the family of Cassilis carries at
this day; which shows, that they had the
double tressure sloree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. et cart. in pub. arch.</NOTE> and contraflorce, with
flower de lisses to their arms, long before they
matched with the royal family.</P>
<P>This sir Gilbert was often designed Kenna∣dy,
and had lands in his possession of the same
designation, which appears by the following
charter of confirmation from the earl of Len∣nox
to his son,</P>
<P>V. Sir GILBERT de CARRICK, or Ken∣nady,
who succeeded him. There is a charter
of Malcolm earl of Lennox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Levenax, pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 70.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. facta Gil∣berto

Cromiearne, Blairsode, &amp;c.</HI> to which
Malcolm, son of the above earl, sir Adam
More, and Gilbert Drummond, are witnesses.</P>
<P>This sir Gilbert died about the 1290, and
was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VI. DUNCAN de CARRICK, or Kennady,
who made a donation of his patronage of the
church of Kilbryde in Carrick to the nuns of
North-berwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd. p. 39.</NOTE> wherein he is designed <HI>Dunca∣nus

<P>As he had begun to drop the name of Car∣rick,
and was more frequently designed by the
name of Kennedy, as <HI>caput totius prosapiae,</HI> so
the cadets of the family, who were now be∣come
numerous, followed his example, laid
aside the name of Carrick altogether, and em∣braced
that of Kennedy, of which there are
many examples in our records; but whether
any of them were brothers or sons of this
Duncan, I cannot determine, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Duncan was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>

to the English;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> in which charter he is design∣ed

<P>By the same charter, king Robert again re∣ceives
him into favour, restores him to the

<P>He got also possession of the lands of Dun∣nure,
which afterwards became their chief
title; and he was the last of this family who
was designed by the name of Carrick.</P>
<P>He left issue a son and successor,</P>

<P>He was a man of good parts, was often
employed in negotiations of the greatest im∣portance,

<P>3. <HI>John,</HI> who appears to have been an∣cestor

<P>1. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> who died in the French ser∣vice

<P>2. <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's Peerage, p. 73.</NOTE> who, according to Mr. Craw∣furd,

<P>Sir Gilbert married, 2dly, Marian, daugh∣ter

Stewart, two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Gilbert,</HI> afterwards lord Kennedy.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> who devoted himself to the
church, entered into holy orders, and became
a great ornament to his profession. For true
piety, and universal benevolence, he was ex∣ceeded
by none.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Keith's catalogue of bishops, p. 18.</NOTE> He was promoted to the
see of Dunkeld <HI>anno</HI> 1438, and translated to

He was one of the privy council to king
James II. and chancellor of Scotland in <HI>anno</HI>

<P>He was one of the regents of the kingdom
in king James III.'s minority, and had the
chief direction of all state affairs, which he
managed with such prudence and discretion,
that his whole conduct was universally ap∣proven.</P>
<P>He founded St. Salvator's college in St.
Andrews, and nobly endowed it. His other
acts of piety and munificence, are too nu∣merous
to be here narrated.</P>
<P>He died on 10th May 1466, and was in∣terred
in the noble chapel of St. Salvator's
college, in a beautiful and stately monument,
which he erected himself.</P>
<P>We shall sum up this great man's charac∣ter
from Buchanan, who says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage Buchanan, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"that he sur∣passed

<P>XI. GILBERT, first son of sir James Ken∣nedy,

of the lands and barony of Cassilis, and a great

his undoubted heir male; but the ho∣nours
being claimed both by him and the earl
of March, the heir of line, the controversy
is now depending, and will soon be deter∣mined
by the parliament of Great-Britain.</P>

had issue.</P>
<P>He died in the 85th year of his age, <HI>anno</HI>
1732, and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XX. CHARLES, eighth lord Cathcart.
In his early youth he betook himself to the
study of arms, and learned the first rudiments
of that art under the great duke of Marlbo∣rough,
where his genius soon displayed itself,
and his actions pointed the future general.</P>
<P>In 1704, he had a company in general
M<SUP>c</SUP>Cartney's regiment of foot, and was soon
after made a captain of grenadiers. In 1706,
he was promoted to a troop of the Royal
Scotch dragoons. In 1707, he was appointed
brigade-major. In 1709, he was made ma∣jor
of the royal regiment of dragoons, then
commanded by the earl of Stair. And in
1711, he got a lieutenant-colonel's breviate.</P>
<P>Upon king George I's accession to the
throne, he was appointed, first, groom; next,
lord of the bedchamber; also colonel of a re∣giment
of horse in Ireland, and governor of
Duncannon castle.</P>
<P>In 1734, he was elected one of the sixteen
peers for Scotland to the eighth British par∣liament.</P>
<P>In 1740, when the expedition was resolved
upon to attack the king of Spain in his Ame∣rican
settlements, lord Cathcart was pitched
upon, as a person whose conduct and courage
fitted him for the command of such an impor∣tant
enterprise, and accordingly was appoint∣ed
general in chief. He set sail from Spithead
in October 1740, but, unhappily both for the
expedition and the honour of the nation, he
was seized with a dysentery, and died at Do∣minica,
one of the leeward islands, the 20th
of December thereafter.</P>
<P>Charles lord Cathcart had a head that qua∣lified
him to shine in that distinguished rank
to which his birth and merit raised him; but
he had more: He had a heart full of benevo∣lence,

<HEAD>COLVILE Lord COLVILE of CULROSS.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of COLVILE is original∣ly
from France, and it is the general
opinion of our historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goodal's in∣troduction to Fordun's hist. page 60.</NOTE> that they came from
Normandy to England, with William the
Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, and to Scotland with
king David I. who succeeded to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1124.</P>
<P>There were some considerable families of
the name of Colvile in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba∣ronage of England. Rymer's foed.</NOTE> that subsisted
several centuries after the conquest, but they
appear to be now extinct.</P>
<P>The first of this noble family we find up∣on

in the reigns of king Malcolm IV. and
king William the Lyon, which last succeed∣ed
to the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>

<P>In another confirmation by the same

a man of the first rank in the reign of king
William.</P>

<HEAD>LINDSAY Earl of CRAWFURD.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble and illustrious name of Lind∣say
is of very great antiquity in Scot∣land;
but there are many different accounts
of their origin.</P>
<P>Some say, that a man of considerable rank
and courage, who gave great assistance to
king Kenneth II. in his wars against the Picts,
about the year 838, was the first of the sir∣name
of Lindsay in this country.</P>
<P>Sir William Dugdale, in his baronage,
mentions several considerable families of the
name of Lindsay in England, in the eleventh
and twelfth centuries; that their sirname was
local, and was first assumed by the proprietors
of the lands and manor of Lindsai, in the
county of Essex.</P>
<P>Our best antiquaries therefore are of opi∣nion,
that one of these Lindsays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lesly, Boe∣thius, Aber∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rombie, &amp;c.</NOTE>
having con∣tracted
a friendship with king Malcolm Can∣more,
when in England, came with him to
Scotland, where he settled, and had several
lands bestowed upon him by that generous
prince, particularly the lands of Wachopdale,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that he was progenitor of the Lind∣says
in Scotland. Certain it is they began to
make a figure in this country, in the reign of
king Alexander I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. &amp; Fordun.</NOTE> who was son of king Mal∣colm
Canmore, succeeded to the crown, <HI>anno</HI>
1107, and died, <HI>anno</HI> 1124: and in the
reigns of king William the Lion, and king
Alexander II. there were a number of patri∣ots
and great men of that sirname in Scot∣land,
which is attested by all Scotch histori∣ans.</P>
<P>There flourished in the reign of king Da∣vid
I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Dal∣rymple's hi∣storical col. p. 351, 2, &amp;c.</NOTE> two brothers,
Willielmus and Walte∣rus
de Lindsay, but which of them was the

<P>I. WILLIELMUS de LINDSAY, was the

is documented by many authentic writs. He
appears to have been much about the court
of king David I. who succeeded to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1124, and died <HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>He was witness to most of the charters and
donations made by that good prince to the re∣ligious;

<P>This Alexander, master of Crawfurd, and

possession of his houses and revenues; for
which they were tried, and found guilty, at
a justice-court, held in Dundee.</P>
<P>The old earl, being most justly provoked,
thought fit to disinherit them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family, &amp; Crawfurd's peerage</NOTE> and therefore
assigned and disponed his estate and honours
(with the approbation of the crown) in fa∣vours
of his cousin, David Lindsay of Edzel,

next heir-male of the family. The original
disposition, which is still extant, is dated 20th
December 1541; about which time Alex∣ander,
the master, was killed in Dundee;
and his brother died without issue.</P>

heirs-male of this David's body, the estate

<HEAD>CRICHTON Lord CRICHTON, Viscount
FRENDRAUGHT.</HEAD>
<P>THE noble and ancient sirname of Crich∣ton
is mentioned by our historians, in
the reign of king Malcolm Canmore, and
some antiquaries trace their origin even
higher; but it is probable their sirname is
local, and was first assumed by the pro∣prietors
of the lands and barony of Crichton
in the shire of Edinburgh, which has been
long in the possession of this family.</P>
<P>The first of them we find upon record is
Thurstanus de Crichton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> who
is witness to
the soundation charter of the abbacy of Holy∣roodhouse,
<HI>anno</HI> 1128; tho' it appears from
our histories, that there were several great
men of this sirname, betwixt the time that
this Thurstanus lived and the reign of king
Alexander II. yet as we cannot exactly con∣nect
them, we shall deduce their descent, by
authentic documents, from</P>
<P>I. WILLIELMUS de CRICHTON, who
flourished in the reign of king Alexander II.
and in a charter of Maldwin earl of Lenox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Levenax, pen▪ MacFarlane, p. 44.</NOTE>

have been before 1240.</P>
<P>He lived after the year 1260, and was
succeeded by his son,</P>

one of those great barons or freeholders that
swore fealty to king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. vol. III p. 659.</NOTE> for lands ly∣ing

<P>I. Sir RODERICK MACKENZIE, second
son of sir Colin of Kintail, was a man of singular
prudence, great courage and resolution, and
was very instrumental in civilizing the north∣ern
parts of this kingdom, which was of
great service to the nation, and extremely
agreeable to his majesty king James VI. who
was pleased not only to confer the honour of
knighthood upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage,</NOTE> but likeways to give
him a grant of several lands in the north coun∣try,
then in the crown by forfeiture.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter of Tor∣quill

<P>In 1654, he was joined in commission
with general Middleton, by king Charles II.
to raise forces for his majesty's service, which
they did, and maintained a war against the
English for above twelve months; but at last,
being defeated by general Morgan, he was
forced to capitulate, which he did upon ho∣nourable
terms.</P>
<P>His majesty, being perfectly sensible of his
loyalty and faithful services, was pleased, soon
after his restoration, to make him one of the
senators of college of justice, and one of his
privy council, <HI>anno</HI> 1661.</P>
<P>In 1678, he was constituted justice-gene∣ral,

his commission for being lord register,
which office he lost at the revolution; but
king William, being no stranger to his great
abilities, was pleased to restore him to the
lord register's office, <HI>anno</HI> 1692.</P>
<P>About this time he published, from authentic
documents and records, his learned vindicati∣on
of king Robert III. from the imputation of
bastardy; and rectified an error, which many
of our historians had most unaccountably fal∣len
into.</P>
<P>In the beginning of queen Anne's reign,
he was constituted secretary of state, <HI>anno</HI>
1702; and on the 1st of January 1703, her

appointed a captain of foot, and in 1745,
was sent, with a detatchment from Ireland,

he, with his son, lord MacLeod, were sur∣prised
and taken by a party of lord Suther∣land's

<P>They were sent prisoners to Inverness, and

<P>ANTIQUARIES do not exactly a∣gree
about the origin of the illustri∣ous
name of Ramsay.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that it came origin∣ally
from Germany, the armorial bearing be∣ing
an eagle displayed.</P>
<P>Others, with more probability, say, from
England; that it is local, and was first assum∣ed
from the lands and abbacy of Ramsay, in
Nottinghame-shire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Certain it is, the Ramsays were settled in
this country as early as the reign of king Da∣vid
I. who succeeded to the crown of Scot∣land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1124.—And it appears, from
Rymer's foedaera Angliae, and Prynne's collec∣tions,
that there were many considerable fa∣milies
in Scotland of that sirname, long be∣fore
the reign of king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>It is evident also from our histories and re∣cords,
that (besides the Ramsays in Mid-Lo∣thian)
there were many eminent families of
that sirname in Fife, Angus, and Perth-shire,
in very early times, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ramsays of Co∣luthie,
Carnock, Corston, Forthar, Parbroath,
Auchterhouse, Balmain, Banff, and many o∣thers,
some whereof have been hereditary
sheriffs of Angus, sheriffs of Fife, Edinburgh,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have enjoyed the highest offices in
the state; but whether they are all descend∣ed
from the Ramsays of Dalhousie, who are
certainly the head or chief of the Ramsays in
Midlothian, we shall not pretend to determine,
but shall proceed to deduce the descent of this
noble family by authentic documents, from</P>
<P>I. SIMON de RAMSAY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Char. in pub. arch.</NOTE> who flourished
in the reign of king David I. and Malcom IV.
and is witness in a grant of the church of Li∣vingston,

in West-Lothian, by <HI>Thurstanus fi∣lius
Livingi,</HI> to the monastery of Holyrood∣house,
<HI>anno</HI> 1140.</P>
<P>He is also witness to a charter, in the reign
of king Malcolm, wherein William de Mor∣ville,
constable of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. of the Episcopal see of Glasgow.</NOTE> grants the lands
of Gilmorstoun in Mid-Lothian, <HI>Eudulpho fi∣lio

<P>V. Sir WILLIAM, who, in several au∣thentic
writs, is designed <HI>Willielmus Ramsay
de Dalwolsy, miles, &amp;c.</HI> and is the first we
find designed by that title.</P>
<P>He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's coll. vol. III. p. 662.</NOTE> with many of his brave countrymen,
was forced to swear fealty to king Edward I.
of England, for his lands lying in Mid-Lo∣thian,
<HI>viz.</HI> Dalwolsy, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1296; and
also for his lands in the shire of Berwick, <HI>viz.</HI>
Fowlden, <HI>&amp;c. eodem anno.</HI></P>
<P>The Ramsays were now become so nume∣rous,
that it is not easy to distinguish what fa∣mily
they belonged to, except when they are
locally designed: there are no less than nine
of that sirname that swore fealty to king Ed∣ward
I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> for lands lying in different counties,
<HI>anno</HI> 1296 and 1297.</P>
<P>And though this sir William was after∣wards
obliged to renew the same oath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 2015.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1304, yet being convinced in his own mind,
that an oath imposed by an enemy, who had
the power in his own hands, could not bind
him against the interest of his country, he was
amongst the first that joined king Robert
Bruce, when he begun to assert his title to
the crown, adhered firmly to his interest ever
after, and performed many brave and heroic
actions in the service of his country, under
the conduct of that great prince.</P>
<P>His brave friend and cousin sir Edmund
Ramsay was, with others of the chief nobili∣ty,
carried to London by king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in
1296, but had the good fortune to get back
to Scotland in 1297: he also took the first op∣portunity
of joining king Robert Bruce, and
contributed not a little to the freeing of his
country from the oppressions of the English.</P>
<P>Sir William was one of the worthy patri∣ots,
who signed that famous letter to the pope▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE>
asserting the independency of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI>

<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>

<P>He per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormed many glorious actions in
the wars against the enemies of his country,
in the reign of king David II, particularly,
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
he, with remarkable courage and conduct,
raised the siege of Dunbar, then reduced to
great straits by the English, and soon after
surprised and took the strong castle of Rox∣burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 334.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1342.</P>
<P>King David, being perfectly sensible of his
worth and merit, thought he could never do
too much for so great a patriot; he therefore
made him constable of the castle of Roxburgh,
warden of the middle marches, and sheriff of
the county of Teviotdale.</P>
<P>This was highly resented by William Dou∣glas,
lord of Liddisdale, who having, by his
own valour and conduct, retaken most of
these lands from the English, and reduced
that country to the king's obedience, thought
none but himself had any title to the chief of∣fices
in those parts; he therefore beset sir A∣lexander,
when holding a court at Hawick,
and suspecting no danger, took him prisoner,
and confined him in his castle of Hermitage,
where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 335.</NOTE> 'tis said, he was starved to death, <HI>an∣no</HI>

lost no opportunity of exerting his courage
in the wars against the English.</P>

<HEAD>DOUGLAS Duke of DOUGLAS.</HEAD>
<P>IF a long train of illustrious ancestors, di∣stinguished
by the highest titles, and
connected with the most august and noble fa∣milies
in Europe, can make any name re∣markable
and great, there is no subject can
plead a higher claim than the Douglas; but
it is the least part of the glory of this fami∣ly,
that it has been honoured with alliances
by marriage into the first rank of nobility in
Scotland, England, and France, even with
crowned heads, having matched eleven times
with the royal house of Scotland, and once
with that of England.</P>
<P>That, besides the honours conferred on
them by their own sovereigns, they have
been dukes of Turenne, counts of Longue∣ville,
and marishals of France; they were
more distinguished by their virtue and merit,
than by their titles and opulency, and the
lustre of their actions outshone the splendour
of their birth.</P>
<P>Hence we see them leading the van of our
armies in Scotland; supporting, by their va∣lour,
the kingdom and crown of France, tot∣tering
on the head of Charles VII. when re∣duced
to the last extremity by the bravery
of the English; raising the siege of Dantzick,
for which they had the highest honours con∣ferred
upon them; conquering the Saracens
in Spain; with many other acts of military
glory that have made this family renowned
through all the corners of Europe, for which
we must refer to our historians, as our busi∣ness
is more properly genealogy than biogra∣phy.</P>
<P>The traditional account of the origin of
this noble family, transmitted to us by histo∣rians,
is,</P>
<P>About the year of God 770, in the reign
of Solvathius king of the Scots, one Donald
Bane, of the western isles, having invaded
the Scotch territories, and routed the royal
army, a man of rank and figure came season∣ably
with his friends and followers to the
king's assistance; he renewed the battle, and
obtained a compleat victory over the invad∣er.
The king being desirous to see the man,
who had done him so signal a piece of service,
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>
he was pointed out to him by his colour or
complexion, in these words of the old Ga∣lic
or Celtic language, SHOLTO DU-GLASH;
in English, <HI>Behold that black or swarthy colour∣ed
man,</HI> from which he was named Sholto the
Douglas.</P>
<P>The king royally rewarded his great ser∣vices,
and gave him a grant of several lands
and large possessions in the county of Lanark,
which were called Douglas, and from hence
came the sirname of the family.</P>
<P>This Sholto is said to have left issue two
sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Hugh,</HI> ancestor of the Douglases in
Scotland.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> progenitor of the Scoti Du∣glassii
in Italy.</P>
<P>As the illustrious and numerous family of
the Scoti in Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Umbertus Locatus, Franc. San <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp;c.</NOTE> are acknowledged by Ita∣lian
historians, as well as our own, to be de∣scended
of the Douglases, we shall therefore
take the liberty here to give a short account
of them from the best authorities.</P>
<P>Achaius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrom∣bie, vol. I. p. 111 Lib. Ferdun, Ib. II. cap. 15.</NOTE> king of the Scots, entered into a
league with Charlemagne, king of France, a∣bout
the year 800, which subsisted inviolate
betwixt the two crowns above 800 years. In
consequence of this league, Achaius sent his
brother William with 4000 auxiliaries to
the emperor, who was marching an army in∣to
Italy to the pope's assistance against Desi∣derius,
king of the Lombards, who had in∣vaded
the ecclesiastical territories.</P>
<P>William Douglas, second son of the said
Sholto, accompanied him in this expedition;
and, being one of his chief commanders, had
a large share of the glory acquired by the
Scots in that enterprize.</P>
<P>After the war was ended, William de Dou∣glas,
being indisposed, was left behind at Pla∣centia,
when the auxliaries went home; and
being recovered, he married the daughter of
Antonio Spetino, one of the most honourable
families in that country. He settled there,
and from him all that great and numerous fa∣mily
of the Scoti Duglassii are descended,
who have always carried the same armorial
bearings with the Douglases in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacK<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nzie. Nisbet's he∣raldry, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>viz▪

<P>An Italian historian says, <HI>Quando Carolo
Magno sece l' impresa in Italia contra Deside∣rio
Re de Longobardi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Franciscus Sansovinus de prima o∣rigine delle ease illustri d' Italia lib. I.</NOTE> <HI>hebbe per suo condutiere

familia de conti de Duglasi, &amp;c.</HI> which suf∣ficiently
shows, that the Scoti in Italy ac∣knowledge
their descent from the Douglases.</P>
<P>And as there was a full account of these
Scoti transmitted by Marc Antonio Scoto,
count de Agusano, to William marquis of
Douglas, with their descent from the above
period, an exact copy whereof, together with
the large genealogical tree of the Douglases
in Scotland, finely done and beautifully illu∣minate,
is in possession of sir William
Dou∣glas
of Glenbervy, to that we refer, and re∣turn
to the Douglases in Scotland.</P>
<P>And as we cannot, from certain docu∣ments,
connect their descent, till about three
hundred years after Sholto, we shall pass over
the traditional account, and deduce their ge∣nealogy
where we have vouchers from hi∣story
or records.</P>
<P>I. WILLIAM de DOUGLAS, said to be li∣neally
descended from the above Sholto, was
created lord or <HI>dominus de</HI> Douglas, by king

year of his reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> is designed <HI>Williel∣mus

<P>He is also witness in another charter with
Joceline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Kelso penes Mac∣Farlane, p. 319.</NOTE> bishop of Glasgow, which must have
been betwixt 1174 and 1199, in which last

<P>1. <HI>Archibald,</HI> lord of Douglas.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Bricius Douglas,</HI> who was bred to the

<P>Sir William died before the year 1200,

who appears to have been possessed of a vast
estate; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Murray, p. 82, 97, 125. &amp;c.</NOTE> being a man of great parts, was
much in favour with king Alexander II. and

<P>1. <HI>Hugh,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> who succeeded his brother.</P>
<P>VI. HUGH, sixth lord of Douglas, suc∣ceeded
his father, and was a man of singular
valour and courage: he, when a young man,
eminently signalized himself at the battle of
Largis in Cunningham, where king Alexan∣der
III. commanded in person, and obtained a
compleat victory over Haco king of Norway,
who had invaded Scotland with a numerous
army, <HI>anno</HI> 1263.</P>

noticed; but, dying without issue, was
succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>VI. WILLIAM, seventh lord of Douglas,
who, on account of his singular boldness and
intrepidity, was called William the hardy.
He was amongst the first men of rank that
joined Sir William Wallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the royal family of Stewart.</NOTE> and embraced e∣very
opportunity of exerting his valour and
courage against the enemies of his country.</P>
<P>He confined William de Abernethy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, lib II. cap. 2.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
in his castle of Douglas, for the slaughter of
Duncan earl of Fife, <HI>anno</HI> 1288.</P>
<P>He was one of the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> that
signed a letter to the king of England about
the marriage of queen Margaret of Scotland
to his eldest son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom▪ II. p. 472.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>In 1295 he was governor of Berwick,
then in the hands of the Scots, which he
gallantly defended for a long time against
king Edward I. and the English army, but
was at last overpowered, and forced to sur∣render.</P>
<P>And though almost the whole country was
soon after over-run by the English, yet Wil∣liam
lord Douglas was the only man of rank
in Scotland that could never be prevailed up∣on
to submit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rapin's hist. of England, vol. I. p. 375</NOTE> or swear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealty to a prince who
had no title or right to the kingdom, but
what force gave him.</P>
<P>He was thereafter carried prisoner to Eng∣land,
where he remained confined for seven
years.</P>
<P>He married,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the royal family▪ p. 519.</NOTE> 1st, Elizabeth, eldest daughter

He married, 2dly,—daughter of sir
William Keith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 3. Home, Craw∣furd, &amp;c.</NOTE> great marishal of Scotland.</P>
<P>He married, 3dly,—daughter of Fer∣rairs
earl of Derby; and, dying prisoner in
England <HI>anno</HI> 1303,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromb. vol. II. p. 497.</NOTE> was succeeded by his el∣dest
son,</P>
<P>VII. JAMES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 3.</NOTE> eighth lord of Douglas, well
known by the name of good sir James, who,
by all our historians, is allowed to have been
one of the greatest heroes of his time.</P>
<P>He joined king Robert Bruce as soon as
he began to assert his title to the crown. He
assisted at his coronation at Scoon, <HI>anno</HI> 1306.
and never deserted him when reduced to the
last extremity, but was always assisting to him
in his greatest distress. According to a ce∣lebrated
author, <HI>in omnibus guerris suis ath∣leta
fidissimus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun▪ lib. 43. cap. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>In 1313 he assaulted and took the castle
of Roxburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. lib. 12. cap. 19.</NOTE> then in the hands of the En∣glish.</P>
<P>In June 1314, he commanded the left
wing of the Scotch army at the battle of Ban∣nockburn,
and had no small share of the glo∣ry
gained by the Scots against the English
on that memorable day; where, on account of
his gallant behaviour, he received from king
Robert the honour of knighthood, under the
banner in the field, which, in these days, was
in higher esteem than the peerage.</P>
<P>He was constituted warden of the marches
towards England. He often invaded that
country, and always returned with success.
According to Fordun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. cap. 25.</NOTE> he killed three chief
commanders, in three different engagements,
with his own hands.</P>
<P>He got a grant from king Robert, to him
and his heirs, of the town, castle, and forest
of Jedworth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The charter contains ma∣ny
noble and honourable clauses: and that it
might remain for ever, he was invested with
the king's emerald ring at Berwick the 8th
of November, and 19th year of his reign, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1324.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in archiv. famil. de Douglas.</NOTE> There was then added to his ar∣morial

wreath of stakes, in commemoration of his
having wreathed in the English in the said fo∣rest,
so that they could not escape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George M'Kenzie, Nisbet, &amp;c.</NOTE> and then
defeated them.</P>
<P>He afterwards obtained a new charter from
king Robert the Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ro∣tulis Roberti I. &amp; chart. in archiv. fam. de Douglas.</NOTE> of all the lands and
town of Douglas, tenement of Kirkmichael,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which he is designed <HI>Jacobus dominus

<P>He obtained also, from king Edward of
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tom. IV. p. 34, 400.</NOTE> a right of all the lands and castles
that belonged to his father William lord
Douglas, in Northumberland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in May
1329.</P>
<P>King Robert finding him hear his end, and
unable to undertake a journey to the Holy
Land, to perform a certain vow he had made,
requested his faithful friend sir James Dou∣glas,
that he would carry his heart to Jeru∣salem,
and bury it near our Saviour's sepul∣chre.
Sir James chearfully undertook the
arduous task,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun. lib. 13. cap. 20.</NOTE> and had the good fortune to ex∣ecute
it, though it cost him his life. For
which the family got added to their armorial
bearing, <HI>argent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M'Kenzie, Nisbet, &amp;c.</NOTE> a man's heart, <HI>gules,</HI> ensigned
with an imperial crown, <HI>proper.</HI></P>
<P>Sir James, in his expedition to the holy
and, took with him three valiant knights,
sir William Sinclair of Rosline, sir William
Keith, and sir Robert Logan, with about two
hundred gentlemen of approven courage,
(some historians say a great many more,)
but having interred king Robert's heart at
the holy sepulchre, he joined the king of
Arragon against the Infidels, and was killed
in Spain on 31st of August 1331, after having
been thirteen times victorious against the
Turks and Saracens;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun. lib. 13. cap. 21.</NOTE> and, according to the
same author, fifty seven times against the
English.</P>
<P>Thus died the brave and valiant sir James
Douglas, who, having never married, left on∣ly
a natural son.</P>
<P><HI>Archibald de Douglas,</HI> a brave and gallant
officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. lib. 14. cap. 16.</NOTE> who accompanied William first earl
of Douglas to the battle of Poictiers in France,

<P>According to the M. S. history of the
family, he settled near Bourdeaux, married
there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. in arch. famil. de Douglas.</NOTE> and was progenitor of some consider∣able
families of the name of Douglas, which
are subsisting in France to this day.</P>
<P>James lord Douglas was succeeded by his
brother,</P>

son of William the hardy, who never mar∣ried,
but resigned his lands in favours of his

his death bestowed it upon this Archibald; and
that he was afterwards designed lord of Gal∣loway,
is attested by many historians, both
Scotch and English.</P>
<P>He was a man of great bravery and cou∣rage,
of which he gave many proofs in seve∣ral
rencounters against the English; and tho'
he was not always successful, yet he still came
off with honour even when discomfited.</P>
<P>He was a faithful and steady friend to king
David Bruce, and had the chief command of

the memorable battle of Otterburn was fought
with incredible courage and obstinacy on both
sides, on 31st July 1388.</P>
<P>The Scots obtained the victory, though far
inferior in numbers to the English, which was

<P>In 1420, he invaded England, laid waste
the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. cap. 32.</NOTE> burnt Alnwick, and returned to

<P>Being highly esteemed for his valour and

of 10,000 men, according to For∣dun,
<HI>anno</HI> 1423, where he had the chief com∣mand,
and did such signal service to the crown
of France, that king Charles VII. gave the
dutchy of Turenne to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. cap. 25. Abercromby, &amp;c.</NOTE> and his heirs for

and succeeded him <HI>anno</HI> 1424.</P>
<P>He went to France in 1419,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, lib. XV. cap. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> when a young

<P>He died in February 1440, and was suc∣ceeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. WILLIAM, sixth earl of Douglas,
third duke of Turenne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a youth of a fine
genius, a noble and undaunted spirit, and of
great expectation. Soon after his father's
death, he came to a meeting of a parliament
at Edinburgh, with a splendid and numerous
retinue, and behaved with all due obedience
and submission; was in great favour with the
young king, and gave all the marks of a sin∣cere,
generous, and loyal disposition. How∣ever,
it seems his grandeur made him to be
looked upon with a jealous eye by the ruling
faction at the time, though he was then on∣ly
about sixteen years of age.</P>
<P>He and his young brother were invited to
an entertainment in the castle of Edinburgh,
by chancellor Crichton: they went without
the least suspicion or distrust, and were both
barbarously assassinated, with their trusty
friend sir Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld,
in the king's presence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. page 514. All Scotch hi∣storians relate this fact.</NOTE> who had the tragical
event in the utmost abhorrence, and wept bit∣terly;
but had not the power to prevent it.
This happened upon the 24th November
1440; and the earl and his brother being
both unmarried, the estate and honours de∣volved
upon their uncle James earl of Aber∣corn,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XI. JAMES, seventh earl of Douglas,
fourth duke of Turenne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> second son of
Archibald fourth, and brother of Archibald
fifth earl of Douglas, being a big corpulent
man, was called James the Gross.</P>
<P>He was warden of the marches towards
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the royal family, p. 115. &amp; Chart. in ar∣chivis familiae de Douglas.</NOTE> in the reign of king James II. and
married Beatrix, daughter of Robert duke of
Albany, governour of Scotland, and is de∣signed

and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>William</HI> earl of Douglas.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Douglas</HI> of Herriotmuir, who
succeded his brother.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Archibald,</HI> earl of Murray, a man of
singular courage, conduct, and magnanimity.
He had the chief command of the Scotch ar∣my
at the battle of Sark, where they obtain∣ed
a compleat victory over the English. He
married lady Mary, daughter and co-heiress
of James Dunbar earl of Murray, with whom
he got the earldom.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Hugh,</HI> earl of Ormond, whose son Hugh
was dean of Brechin, and died without issue.</P>
<P>5. <HI>John,</HI> lord Balvenie, died without
issue.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Henry Douglas,</HI> went into holy orders.</P>
<P>1st Daughter, lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to
James earl of Morton.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Beatrix,</HI> married to Robert Stew∣art
lord d' Aubigny.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Janet,</HI> married to Robert lord
Fleming, ancestor of the earl of Wigton.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to—
Wallace of Craigie. The earl lived but three
years after the murder of his nephews; and,
dying in 1443, was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. WILLIAM, eighth earl of Douglas,
fifth duke of Turenne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> He had vast
possessions, great superiorities, and an incre∣dible
number of vassals and followers; so that
he was envied by some, and dreaded by o∣thers.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 254.</NOTE> he was long in great favour
with king James II. was one of his privy
council in 1444, and lord lieutenant of the
kingdom. He had the disposal of all offices
and places of trust till 1449, that the king
took the management into his own hands;
and in that year he was appointed one of the
guarantees of a treaty with the English; but
upon some changes happening at court, he
laid down all his employments, and retired
to the country, where, 'tis said, he lived
more like a sovereign prince than a subject,
which gave great offence to the king and mi∣nistry.
But it seems he was conscious to
himself of no ill intentions; and, apprehend∣ing
no danger, he went to Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, p. 515.</NOTE> accompani∣ed
with a splendid retinue of gentlemen of
the first rank, <HI>anno</HI> 1450, being the year of
the Jubilee.</P>
<P>The enemies of his family, who had been
accomplices in the murder of his cousins, be∣ing
jealous of his power, and afraid of his re∣turn,
endeavoured to instil bad notions, of him
into the mind of the king, and got several
suits and processes commenced against his
friends and family in his absence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aberer. v. II. p. 149 &amp; 150.</NOTE> which be∣ing
fully narrated in Doctor Abercrombie's
history, we shall here pass them over.</P>
<P>The earl being informed of what was do∣ing
against him, thought proper to make the
best of his way home. He dismissed his grand
retinue, and, passing through England incog.
sent a dutiful message to the king, full
of obedience and submission.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 315.</NOTE> The king ac∣cepted
it most graciously, received him kind∣ly,
and he got again greatly into his majesty's
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour.</P>
<P>In April 1451,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. tom. II. page 285.</NOTE> he was one of the ambas∣sadors
sent to England, to confer and make
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
up the differences about the breaches of the
late truce.</P>
<P>After which, having been guilty of some
arbitrary proceedings in his own country, he
went to the court of England, where king
James was informed he had been engaged in
some treasonable practices.</P>
<P>Upon his return he was ordered to attend
the king at Stirling; but, knowing he had
many enemies at court, refused to come with∣out
a safe conduct, which the king granted
him in the strongest terms, and most ample
form.</P>
<P>He went to Stirling accordingly, was in∣troduced
to the king, who retired with him
into a closet, where they had a long confe∣rence
by themselves.</P>
<P>Doctor Abercrombie acknowledges he an∣swered
the king dutifully and submissively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie vol. II. p. 354.</NOTE> to
all the points insisted on, till he desired
him to cancell and give up a treasonable
league or association entered into by him, the
earl of Crawford, and others of the nobility:</P>
<P>He answered, That that bond or contract
was not in his possession at the time: that it
contained no treason; and that he could not
give it up without the consent of his associ∣ates.
The king being incensed at his refusal,
and not able to bear such disobedience in a
subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi∣storians agree in this fact.</NOTE> drew out a dagger, and stabbed the earl
to the heart, of which he died instantly, 2d
February <HI>anno</HI> 1452.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, ninth earl of Douglas, and
sixth duke of Turenne, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who, in resent∣ment
of his brother's slaughter, took up arms
against his lawful sovereign, and soon got to∣gether
a far greater army than the king was
able to raise in so short a space; but how they
were dispersed at that time, our authors give
no account.</P>
<P>It is alledged by most of our historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boethius, Buchanan, Hauthornden Home, Craw∣furd, &amp;c.</NOTE>
that this rebellion subsisted without intermis∣sion
till it was entirely extinguished <HI>anno</HI> 1455;
but as this appears to be a mistake, we beg
leave here to insert some unquestionable do∣cuments,
which we submit to the judgment
of our readers.</P>
<P>Earl James's rebellion certainly broke out
in the end of February 1452; yet we find
this earl not only reconciled to the king, but
employed in public negotiations of state the
very year after the rebellion commenced.

<P>As to what acts of treason the Douglases
committed in England about this period, our

<P>It is most certain that the earl, immediate∣ly
upon his return to Scotland, commenced a
new rebellion, and began to raise forces a∣gainst
the king. He soon found himself a∣gain
at the head of an army superior in num∣ber
to his majesty's. He went in quest of
the royal troops, and overtook them near A∣bercorn,
where the two armies encamped in
sight of one another; but it seems the seeds
of loyalty still took place in the earl's breast,
or he was unwilling to spill the blood of his
fellow-subjects; for certain it is he declined
fighting, at least was not so forward to en∣gage
the royal army as was expected on so fa∣vourable
an opportunity; on which account
lord Hamilton, and some of the chiefs of his
followers, not only openly upbraided him, but
that very night deserted him; went over to
the king's party; were brought before his
majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Godscraft.</NOTE> who graciously received them, ac∣cepted
their submission, and pardoned them;
whereby the royal army daily encreased, and
the rebels diminished, which the king per∣ceiving,
for some time avoided coming to
blows.</P>
<P>The earl of Angus, a faithful and loyal
subject, who detested his cousin's rebellion,
was the king's lieutenant, and commander in
chief of the royal army, finding himself at
last able to encounter the rebels, gave them
battle at Ancrum-muir, and entirely routed
them, <HI>anno</HI> 1455.</P>
<P>The earl of Douglas's brother, the earl of
Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie and Fordun, vol. II. p. 515.</NOTE> was killed on the spot, his brothers,
the earl of Ormond, and lord Balveny, were
taken prisoners, and both beheaded.</P>
<P>The earl himself made his escape to Eng∣land,
where he remained long; and as all
his estates and honours were forfeited to the
crown, his majesty was pleased soon after∣wards
to bestow the whole lands and lordship
of Douglas upon the earl of Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in archiv. fam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. de Douglas. ad ann. 1457.</NOTE> his cou∣sin

<P>The earl, while he staid in England, gave
his king and country great disturbance and
trouble; at last the duke of Albany and he,
having got assistance from king Henry, invad∣ed
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1483.</P>
<P>The old earl was taken prisoner, and
brought into the king's presence, who, out of
his great goodness and lenity, pardoned his
rebellion, and gave him his life.</P>
<P>He retired to the abbacy of Lindores, where
he became a religious and sincere penitent,
and continued a most faithful and loyal sub∣ject,
as long as he lived. When the mal∣contents
took up arms in the end of king
James the III's reign, they knowing the old
earl's great capacity, either for peace or war,
applied to him to join and head them; but
he not only absolutely refused to engage with
them, but used many arguments to make them
change their measures, and return to their
duty; and wrote to all his friends and the
cadets of his family, exhorting them to keep
stedfast in their loyalty, and to continue in
the king's interest, which many of them did,
particularly Cavers Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original let∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦missions, pe∣nes Cavers-Douglas.</NOTE> then sheriff of
Teviotdale, a man of great power in the south
of Scotland, who, being himself a good sub∣ject,
followed the advice of his chief, and
joined the king, on which account he suffer∣ed
many hardships, though he afterwards got
two remissions, one from king James IV. and
another from the states.</P>
<P>The earl quite wore out with age and in∣firmities,
died without issue at Lindores, 15th
April 1488, was the last earl of Douglas, and
in him ended the first branch of this noble
and illustrious house, whose ruin was chiefly
owing to their grandeur, riches, and power,
being rather too great for subjects in a mo∣narchical
state.</P>
<P>The male line of the first and second sons
of William, first earl of Douglas, thus end∣ing,
his third son George, who was ancestor
of the earls of Angus, and duke of Douglas,
and also heir-male of the earls of Douglas,
was the next great branch of this illustrious
family, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>IX. GEORGE, son of William, first earl of
Douglas, by lady Margaret Stewart, countess

and he was the first earl of Angus of the name
of Douglas.</P>
<P>In an original charter of king Robert III.

his father, and was sent to England
to negotiate his uncle, king James I.'s ran∣som,
<HI>anno</HI> 1423,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. X. p. 307.</NOTE> which was happily accom∣plished
the following year, when the earl had
the honour of knighthood conferred upon

and honours devolved upon his uncle George,

<P>X. GEORGE, fourth earl of Angus, se∣cond
son of George, the first earl, and bro∣ther-german
of William, the second earl, was
a man of eminent loyalty, a true patriot, and
of great ability, both in the cabinet and the
field.</P>
<P>In 1449,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 254.</NOTE> he was one of the Scotch com∣missioners
that concluded a treaty with the

<P>He had the chief command of the king's

which he effectually suppressed, <HI>anno</HI> 1455;
and upon the forfeiture of that great branch
of this illustrious family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. in archiv. fam. de Douglas.</NOTE> he obtained a grant
of the whole lands and lordship of Douglas,
being next heir-male, as before observed, up∣on
which he got a charter, under the great
seal, 8th April <HI>anno</HI> 1457.</P>
<P>In the year 1459,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 426, 434, &amp;c.</NOTE> he was again appointed
one of the commissioners to treat with the
English; a truce was concluded, and he was
made one of the wardens of the marches on
the borders.</P>
<P>About the year 1461, king Henry VI. of
England, being dispossessed of his kingdom
by Edward duke of York, retired to Scot∣land,
and was kindly received by the states,
in the minority of king James III. and find∣ing
the earl of Angus, the greatest man then
in the kingdom, entered into an indenture
with him, wherein he binds himself to erect
into a dukedom or lordship, as much land be∣twixt
Humber and Trent, as would yield two
thousand merles Sterling of yearly rent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indenture in archiv. fam. de Douglas. ad ann. 1462.</NOTE> to the
earl and his heirs for ever; and that for his
assistance to restore him to his kingdom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
The earl immediately begun to persorm his
part of the contract by a singular gallant ac∣tion,

<P>Mr. Brisac, with the French troops under
his command, being then closely besieged in
the castle of Alnwick, the earl raised an ar∣my
of ten thousand horse, marched into Eng∣land
the length of Alnwick, and brought off
the French troops in sight of the whole En∣glish
army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the officers of state, p. 53.</NOTE> and marched with them into Scot∣land,
to the great satisfaction of king Henry.</P>
<P>Upon the death of king James II. he was
appointed one of the governours of king
James III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simson's essay on the family of Douglas.</NOTE> which office he discharged with
honour and reputation.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir An∣drew
Sibbald of Balgonie, <HI>in vicecom. de Fife,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="202"/>
by whom he had two sons, and four daugh∣ters.</P>

<P>3. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to sir Dun∣can
Campbell of Glenurchy.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Isabel,</HI> married to sir Alexander
Ramsay of Dalhousie.</P>
<P>And dying in 1463, was succeeded by his
eldest son,</P>
<P>XI. ARCHIBALD, fifth earl of Angus,
commonly called the great earl, who was a
man of many eminent qualities, and no less
a great statesman than a brave soldier. He
was warden of the east and middle marches,
and one of the privy council to king James
III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Char. in pub. arch.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et chart. in archiv: fam de Dou∣glas.</NOTE> He got a grant of the lands and castle of
Tantallon, all erected into a free barony, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1479.</P>
<P>There is one stain upon this great man's
character, <HI>viz.</HI> he was one of many more of
the nobility that consented to the execution
of two of the king's servants upon Lauder
bridge, without legal trial, <HI>anno</HI> 1481. It
is said they had given the king bad council,
and had put him upon many wrong measures
in the management of public affairs; but we
find this earl soon in favour with his majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and appointed warden of the marches the ve∣ry
year thereafter in very ample form, and
with many singular privileges, <HI>anno</HI> 1482.
He was also appointed one of the commission∣ers
to treat with the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. tom. XII. p. 172</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1483.</P>
<P>In the beginning of king James the IV.'s
reign, he was again appointed warden of the
east marches by act of parliament; one of the
privy council to his majesty; and in 1493,
was constituted lord high chancellor of Scot∣land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the officers of state</NOTE> all which offices he discharged with ho∣nour,
fidelity, and reputation.</P>
<P>1496, he obtained from John earl of
Crawfurd a right to the lordship of Craw∣furd,
<HI>in vicecom.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in archivis fa∣miliae de Dou∣glas.</NOTE> <HI>de Lanark,</HI> (for which he
gave him an equivalent in Angus,) and was
insest in the said lordship, <HI>anno</HI> 1499. He
was one of the guarantees of a treaty with
the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 268.</NOTE> renewed and confirmed <HI>anno</HI>
1509.</P>
<P>The earl being a man of great experience
and knowledge in military affairs, the king
asked his advice and opinion the day before the
battle of Flowdon, which he gave honestly,
and with great judgment, and alledged it was
highly imprudent to fight the English at that
time, for which he advanced many strong ar∣guments;
but this wholesome council has
been most unjustly censured by some histori∣ans,
as proceeding from cowardice or disloy∣alty,
he not being in the action himself, tho'
it appears from good authority, that nothing
but his great age and infirmities hindered him
from going on with the rest; for his two
sons, and about two hundred of his name and
family, were killed oh the spot in that fatal
field, on 9th September 1513.</P>
<P>At length, oppressed with years and sorrow
for the loss his country had sustained, in the
death of their sovereign, the flower of the
nobility, the fate of his two sons, and so ma∣ny
of his family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the officer, of state, &amp;c.</NOTE> at that unfortunate battle,
he retired to a religious house, and died in the
beginning of the year thereafter, <HI>viz.</HI> 1514.</P>
<P>He married thrice: 1st, Elizabeth, daugh∣ter
of Robert lord Boyd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> lord high chancel∣lor

and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> master of Angus.</P>

<P>He accompanied the king to the fatal field
of Flowdon, and there lost his life, with his
royal master, on 9th September 1513.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. ARCHIBALD, who succeeded also to
his grandfather, <HI>anno</HI> 1514, and was sixth
earl of Angus.</P>
<P>He was a man of many noble accomplish∣ments;
was highly honoured at foreign courts
in the course of his travels, and was made a
knight of St. Michael by king Henry II. of
France.</P>
<P>Immediately upon his return home, he ap∣plied
himself to the business of the state, sat
in the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 600.</NOTE> was one of the Scotch
nobles that confirmed a treaty with England,
7th October 1517, and was, by a special act,
made one of the counsellors to king James
V. <HI>anno</HI> 1521.</P>
<P>In 1525, he was appointed one of the com∣missioners
to treat with the English;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. XIV. p. 91.</NOTE> and in
the year 1527, he was made lord high chan∣cellor
of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. and lives of the of∣fiers of state. Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 276.</NOTE> guardian, and lieutenant
of the east and middle marches, and, by act of
parliament, was joined in commission with
some others to negotiate a peace with Eng∣land,
which they happily concluded, <HI>anno</HI> 1528.</P>
<P>He afterwards assumed the sole manage∣ment
of all affairs; and, it is said, kept the
king little better than a prisoner: However,
his majesty made his escape from him, went
to Stirling, was joyfully received by the
queen-mother, and was immediately attend∣ed,
and congratulated by the chief of the no∣bility.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter, the earl of Angus was
turned out of all his employments, was ac∣cused
of several misdemeanors, outlawed, and
attainted of treason.</P>
<P>He retired to England, where he was kind∣ly
entertained by king Henry, and remained
there till 1543, that his attainder was repeal∣ed
by act of parliament, and he was amply
restored to all his estates and honours.</P>
<P>He then returned to Scotland, where he
shewed himself a true patriot, and afterwards
performed many brave actions in the service
of his country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was a zealous promoter of the match
betwixt our young queen and prince Edward
of England, as judging it might put an end
to the great animosities that still subsisted be∣twixt
the two crowns; but it was so strong∣ly
opposed by others of the nobility and great
men, that his endeavours proved fruitless.</P>
<P>When the king of England found that the
marriage could not be brought about by fair
means, he invaded Scotland with an army,
under the command of sir Ralph Ivers and
Brian Layton, in hopes of accomplishing it by
force.</P>
<P>The earl of Angus immediately joined the
governor, with a great party of his friends
and followers, to oppose the enemies of his
country, and the victory obtained over the
English at Ancrum muir, was chiefly ascribed
to this earl's conduct and resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> for which
the king of England, his brother-in-law, tax∣ed
him with ingratitude; but nothing could
prevent him from doing his duty in defence
of his country.</P>
<P>He commanded the van of the army at the
unfortunate battle of Pinky, where his brave
and gallant brother, sir George, lost his lise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and where the earl behaved himself with re∣markable
courage and intrepidity, though the
English obtained the victory, <HI>anno</HI> 1547.</P>
<P>He was now much in favour at court, and
continued to concur with the queen and go∣vernor,
in every measure that was for the
good of his country, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>He made a resignation of his estate and ho∣nours
in the queen's hands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. familiae de Douglas.</NOTE> upon which he
got a new charter under the great seal, in fa∣vours

<P>THE traditional accounts of the origin of
this ancient and illustrious sirname are
various. Some deduce them from a noble
Hungarian, that came to Scotland with queen
Margaret, in the reign of king Malcolm
Canmore.</P>
<P>Others are of opinion, that it is a local sir∣name,
and was first assumed by the proprie∣tors
of the lands and barony of Crichton in
Mid-Lothian.</P>
<P>Certain it is they were settled, and had
possessions in that county, when sirnames be∣gan
to be used in Scotland.</P>
<P>Thurstanus de Crichton was witness to
the foundation charter of the abbay of Holy∣roodhouse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalrymple's historical col∣lect. p. 418.</NOTE>
by king David I. <HI>anno</HI> 1128.</P>
<P>And though we cannot connect this noble
family with Thurstanus, yet we shall deduce
their descent from one of his posterity, who
was their immediate ancestor, and proprietor
of the lands and barony of Crichton, above
five hundred years ago, which is fully instruc∣ted
under the title of lord Crichton, and here∣after
by authentic documents.</P>

<P>WE have good authority to affirm, that
no sirname or family in England can
boast a more noble descent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genealogical coll. by D. J. Burton, au∣thor of Mo¦nast. Ebor. &amp; Monast. An∣glica.</NOTE> than that of the

from the Saxon kings of England, the

<P>But we shall only here briefly deduce their
descent, from the Norman conquest of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>I.—de CONSTABLE, who appears
to have been a man of the first rank in Nor∣mandy,
came over to England with William
the conqueror, (to whom he was nearly re∣lated,)
<HI>anno</HI> 1066, had a considerable com∣mand
in his army, and is mentioned in the

Henry I. of England, and married—
de Burton, with whom he got several lands;
and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monast. Ebor. p. 253.</NOTE> by her donations to the religious in Swyne∣abbay,
she appears to have had large possessi∣ons.</P>
<P>By her lie had issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. Sir ROBERT CONSTABLE, designed
of Halsham in Holderness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There is a
charter still preserved in the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. chart. 144.</NOTE> wherein
he gave four oxgangs of land in Halsham, to Wil∣liam,
son of Utred, his servant; and on his seal
is represented the figure of a man on horse∣back,
properly accoutered, brandishing his
drawn sword in his right hand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which
denotes his being of the equestrian order.</P>
<P>This sir Robert got from William le Gross,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. chart. 134, and 138.</NOTE>
earl of Albemarle, five pound rent charge,

<P><PB N="207" REF="218"/>
Lord George Douglas, second son of the
second marriage of William first marquis of
Douglas, a man of a rare military genius,
was created earl of Dunbarton by king
Charles II. on the 9th March 1675, by pa∣tent
to the heirs-male of his body.</P>
<P>In his younger years he went to France,
and was appointed one of the pages of ho∣nour
to Lewis XIV. but soon went into the
army, where, for his remarkable good beha∣viour,
he rose gradually to the rank of a ma∣jor-general,
was present in most of the
sieges and actions betwixt the French and the
confederates, and, by his valour and conduct,
gained immortal honour.</P>
<P>After the treaty of Nimeguen, he was cal∣led
over to Britain by king Charles II. and re∣sided
mostly at court during the remainder of
that prince's reign, with whom he was in
great favour.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of king James VII. to
the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1685, he was appointed
commander in chief of all the forces in Scot∣land;
and, in that station, went against Ar∣chibald
ninth earl of Argyle, upon his invasi∣on
of this country, and soon put an end to
that rebellion, by dispersing the earl's troops,
and taking himself prisoner.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1687, king James revived the order
of St. Andrew, which had lain dormant for
145 years, and the earl of Dunbarton was
elected one of the knights of that most noble
order.</P>
<P>He had the command of the Scotch royal
regiment, which then consisted of 5000 men,
and adhered firmly to the interest of king
James, as long as he staid in Britain. He
afterwards followed him to France, and died
at St. Germains, <HI>anno</HI> 1692, leaving issue, by
a sister of the dutchess of Northumberland, a
son,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> second earl of Dunbarton, who
succeeded him. He also betook himself to a
military life, and rose to the degree of a co∣lonel
in the British service.</P>
<P>In March 1716, he was appointed envoy
extraordinary, by king George I. to the court
of Russia; but dying without issue, the ho∣nours
became extinct.</P>

<HEAD>SCRYMGEOUR Earl of DUNDEE.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our antiquaries agree, that one sir
Alexander Carron, a brave and valiant
knight, was the first who enjoyed the sirname
of Scrymgeour in Scotland; but our histori∣ans
differ a little about the aera in which he
lived. Buchanan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> places it in the reign
of king Malcolm Canmore; but Fordun, the
best and most ancient author, says, <Q REND="inline">"That in
the beginning of the reign of king Alex∣ander
I. <HI>anno</HI> 1107, there was a plot laid
by the Mearns and Murray men, (then in
rebellion,) to seize the king's person; that
a party of them actually beset his palace in
the night; that sir Alexander Carron, one
of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber, hav∣ing
timeously discovered it, got his ma∣jesty,
by some private passage, safely con∣veyed
away.</Q></P>
<Q><P>The king immediately raised what for∣ces
he could, went in pursuit of the rebels,
and came in sight of them on the banks of
the river Spey, where they were encamp∣ed
in a very great body on the other side.</P>
<P>The water being then extremely high,
it was thought impossible, at least, very
hazardous for the king's troops to pass:
however, the king being incensed at the
audaciousness of the rebels, and eager to
attack them, though they were far superi∣or
in numbers, gave his standard to his
trusty friend sir Alexander Carron, (<HI>quia
noverat in viribus et audacia praevalere,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. I. page 285.</NOTE> says
Fordun) who, with it, immediately jump∣ed
into the river, got safe through, fixed the
royal standard, and displayed the king's co∣lours
on the other side, in sight of the ene∣my;
upon which the whole body passed.
The rebels seeing a royal army so near,
and ready to attack them, were seized with
a panick, took to their heels, and fled with
great precipitation, whereby the king ob∣tained
a compleat and easy victory; but
did not forget to reward the brave and
faithful sir Alexander Carron: he made
him a grant of some lands, and constituted
him heretable standard-bearer to the kings
of Scotland, the office to him and his heirs∣male
for ever. He also gave him the sir∣name
of Scrymgeour, (a hardy fighter)
which his posterity have enjoyed ever
since."</P></Q>
<P>He got likeways a part of the royal arms
of Scotland for his armorial bearing, <HI>viz.
gules,</HI> a lion rampant <HI>or,</HI> armed and langued
<HI>azure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pendix, p. 50.</NOTE> with a sword in his dexter paw pro∣per,
hil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and pommelled of the 2d; and to
perpetuate the memory of the above action,
he took for motto, <HI>Dissipate.</HI></P>
<P>Buchanan, in his account of the affair on
the water of Spey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan, lib. 7. page 199.</NOTE> says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Verum rex a suis
retentus, Alexandro Carroni, Alexandri, cujus
supra meminimus, filio, partem exercitus de∣dit,
qui subito cum suis amnem ingressus, au∣daciae

in fugam statim se conjecerint, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This sir Alexander Scrymgeour was son of
Alexander Carron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and A∣bercrom. vol. I. p. 238.</NOTE> often mentioned with ho∣nour
in the Scotch history.</P>
<P>And though we can give no particular ac∣count
of his marriage and issue, yet, as all our
historians agree that sir Alexander Scrym∣geour,
who flourished in the end of the reign
of king Alexander III. was his lineal repre∣sentative,
therefore we deduce the descent of
this noble family from him.</P>
<P>I. Sir ALEXANDER SCRYMGEOUR, he∣retable
standard-bearer of Scotland, inherit∣ing
the valour and virtue of his ancestors,
joined the brave sir William Wallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, p. 529.</NOTE> in de∣fence
of the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>He was also amongst the first who took
the field with king Robert Bruce, and faith∣fully
adhered to him as long as he lived; and
obtained from that great prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 50.</NOTE> in reward of
his faithful services, several lands about Inner∣keithing
in Fyfe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>II. Sir JOHN SCRYMGEOUR, heretable
standard-bearer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who, like his father,
was a staunch loyalist, and, upon every oc∣casion,
exerted his valour against the enemies
of his country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and at last lost his life at the
fatal battle of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI> 1332, leaving is∣sue

<P>He was a man of great honour and integri∣ty,
a firm and steady friend of the royal fa∣mily.</P>
<P>He was colonel of the Forfar-shire horse
that were raised for duke Hamilton's engage∣ment,
<HI>anno</HI> 1648, and accompanied king
Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> to the battle of Worcester, <HI>anno</HI>

to make his escape, yet he suffered great and
many hardships on account of his loyalty dur∣ing
the usurpation: But the king, in reward
of his constant loyalty and sufferings, was plea∣sed
to create him earl of Dundee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1661,
and appointed him one of his privy council.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Ramsay, daugh∣ter

without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1668, in him ended the
male line of John of Glastre, second son of sir
James the constable, who died <HI>circa annum</HI>
1503.</P>
<P>The representation therefore certainly de∣volved
upon John Scrymgeour of Kirkton,
who was not only heir-male,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and of line, but
also heir of entail, by two solemn deeds, con∣firmed
by charters under the great seal, in
1541 and 1587, before recited.</P>
<P>Yet the duke of Lauderdale had interest
enough with king Charles II. to procure a

got a gift of recognition, whereby Kirk∣ton
was deprived of his just right.</P>

he had finished the course of his studies at
the university of St. Andrews, greatly im∣proved
his excellent parts, by travelling into
foreign countries; and betaking himself to a
military life, he soon discovered an uncommon
genius for the art of war.</P>
<P>He was first a volunteer in the French ser∣vice;
but in 1672, he went into that of the
States of Holland, got a cornet's commission
in the prince of Orange's guards of horse, and
eminently signalized himself at the battle of
Senese, where William prince of Orange com∣manded
the confederates, and the prince of
Conde the French, in August 1674.—He
immediately got the command of a troop of
horse, and served with great reputation as
long as he stayed in that country.</P>
<P>When he came over to Britain, he had
particular recommendations from the prince
of Orange to king Charles II. and the duke
of York.</P>
<P>The king immediately nominated him cap∣tain
of one of the three independent troops,
which were raised to bring the dissenters in
the western counties into a compliance with
the constitution of the church established by
law, <HI>anno</HI> 1678; the other two were com∣manded
by the earls of Home and Airly.</P>
<P>In 1682, he was appointed sheriff of Wig∣ton,
in Scotland; and in 1683, his brother
David was joined in commission with him.</P>
<P>In 1684, he was constituted captain of the
royal regiment of horse.</P>
<P>Upon king James's accession to the crown,
in 1685, he was sworn of the privy council
to his majesty.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1686, he was made a
brigadier-general, and had the constabulary
of Dundee, and barony of Dudhope confer∣red
upon him.</P>
<P>When the prince of Orange landed in Eng∣land,
he marched against him at the head of his
regi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, king James having first made him
a major-general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, p. 117. where the patent printed at large.</NOTE> then raised him to the dig∣nity

<PB N="215" REF="226"/>
whatever, dated 12th November, the fourth
year of the king's reign.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1689, he came to Scot∣land,
and sat in the convention of estates, till
he saw a great majority were for forfeiting king
James; and having got private information,
that the mob had a design to assassinate him,
he made a complaint to the house; but it not
being regarded, and justice denyed him, he
thought proper to retire to his house in the
country, whereupon the convention voted him
an intercommun'd person, and sent a messenger
to require him to appear before them at Edin∣burgh;
but his lordship did not think it safe
to comply; upon which they sent a party to
apprehend him. This forced him to go to
the Highlands for refuge, where, by king
James's authority, he raised about 15 or
1600 of the clans, and being joined by about
300 Irish, under the command of colonel Ca∣non,
he was marching south with his little ar∣my,
when he was informed that general Mac-Kay
was marching against him, with more
than double his number of regulars.</P>
<P>On the 27th of July 1689, they met,
and fought at Killicrankie in Athole, where
the Highlanders obtained the victory, tho'
their brave general lost his life in the action.</P>
<P>By Jean his wife, daughter of William
lord Cochran; son and heir of William, first
earl of Dundonald, he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who died an infant.</P>
<P>And leaving no other issue, the honours
devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>Mr. DAVID GRAHAM, second viscount
of Dundee; who, having been with his bro∣ther
at the battle of Killicrankie, was out∣lawed
and forfeited, <HI>anno</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>He followed king James to France, and
was made knight of the order of St. Andrew
at St. Germains, <HI>anno</HI> 1692. But dying
without issue <HI>anno</HI> 1700, the estate aud ho∣nours,
had it not been for the forfeiture,
would have devolved upon</P>
<P>William Graham of Duntroon, his cousin∣german

Walter before-mentioned.</P>

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. Sir JOHN COCHRAN of that ilk, a
man of singular worth and honour, a firm and
steady friend to king Charles I. was a colonel

<P>In 1644, he was sent ambassador to solli∣cit
assistance from several princes in behalf
of the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Wishart's life of Mont∣rose.</NOTE> and acquitted himself with great
prudence, conduct and fidelity.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he attend∣ed
king Charles II. to foreign parts, who hav∣ing
great confidence in his abilities and loyal∣ty,
sent him on a particular embassy into Po∣land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1650; but before his return, the
king and his army were overthrown at Wor∣cester.</P>
<P>Sir John remained with his majesty dur∣ing
his exile, and married—Butler,
a daughter of the family of Ormond; but dy∣ing
a little before the restoration, without is∣sue,
his estate devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>XV. Sir WILLIAM COCHRAN of Cowdon,
before-mentioned, a man of great parts and
learning, and though, in the beginning of the
civil war, he appeared to be on the parlia∣ment's
side, and was for some time employed
in their service, yet he was inviolably at∣tached
to the interest of the royal family.
He eminently distinguished himself in their
service upon every occasion; particularly in
the parliament 1647,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of the rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> of which he was a
member, and none was more forward than
sir William in raising forces for the relief of
the king, who, on account of his great me∣rit

him to the dignity of the peerage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes comitem de Dundonald, et diploma in Mill's collect.</NOTE> by the title

<P>Some little time thereafter he acquired the
lordship of Paisley, which became one of the
chief seats of the family, and where he af∣terwards
lived in great splendor and magnifi∣cence;
and though it is alledged by bishop
Guthrie, that he was one of the Scotch lords
who voted for the delivering up of the king
to the English, yet it appears he continued
steady in his loyalty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's act of indem∣nity.</NOTE> for which the common∣wealth
of England imposed no less a fine up∣on
him than five thousand pounds Sterling,
<HI>anno</HI> 1654.</P>
<P>And as none had contributed more heartily
and sincerely to bring about a restoration
than lord Cochran, so it was no sooner ac∣complished
than he was made one of the lords
of the privy council to his majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>

of his majesty's treasury and exche∣quer,

station of life to the satisfaction of the

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1622, and was succeeded by

<P>II. CHARLES, second earl of Dunferm∣line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
who got charters, under the great seal,
of several lands and baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1635 <HI>et</HI>
1641.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the troubles in king
Charles I. his reign, he was engaged with
the covenanters, and was one of the com∣mittee
of parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1640.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch commissioners
appointed to treat with the king's, in order
to a peace, and was made a privy counsellor
for life by the parliament <HI>anno</HI> 1641. He
was also one of the committee of estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescind. acts of parl. and Guthrie's me∣moirs.</NOTE> in
the years 1644, 1645, and 1646; but at
last returned to his duty, became a faithful
and loyal subject, was trusted by his majesty,
and continued steady in the interest of the
royal family ever after.</P>
<P>When he was commissioner to the gene∣ral
assembly, he behaved with great prudence
and moderation, and endeavoured all he could
to bring the people to a true sense of their
duty.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he retired
to the country, and lived privately all the
time of the usurpation.</P>
<P>But, upon the first appearance of a resto∣ration,
none was more zealous and forward
in expressing their loyalty, and contributing
their utmost endeavours to bring it about;
of which king Charles II. was so sensible, that
he appointed him one of the lords of his pri∣vy
council, immediately after his restoration.</P>
<P>Upon the death of William earl Marishal,
he was appointed lord privy seal, <HI>anno</HI> 1671.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Douglas, daughter
of William earl of Morton, by lady Agnes
Keith, daughter of George earl Marishal, by
whom he had three sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> who, betaking himself to a ma∣ritime
life, was killed in one of his Majesty's
ships of war in an engagement against the
Dutch, <HI>anno</HI> 1672.</P>
<P>3. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards earl of Dunsermline.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Henriet,</HI> married, 1st,
to William earl of Wigton, and was mother
of John and Charles, earls of Wigton; she
married, 2dly, William earl of Crawfurd, to
whom she had a son and six daughters.</P>
<P>The earl died in 1674, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>III. ALEXANDER, third earl of Dun∣fermline,
who dying unmarried, his estate
and honours devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>III. JAMES, fourth earl of Dunfermline,
a man of great loyalty, honour and probity,
who, being bred in the army, was engaged
in several memorable expeditions, in the ser∣vice
of the States of Holland, where he al∣ways
behaved with remarkable conduct and
resolution; but, upon his brother's death, he
quitted the service, and returned home, where
he lived in great splendor and magnificence,
till the revolution in 1688; but being sin∣cerely
attached to the interest of king James
VII. never deserted or forsook him in his
greatest distress.</P>
<P>When lord Dundee declared for king
James, and began to raise the Highlanders for
his service, he immediately joined him with
a troop of horse, and fought on their head at
the battle of Killicranky, where he behaved
with the courage and conduct becoming so ex∣perienced
an officer, for which he was outlaw∣ed
and forfeited by parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>When he found there was no prospect of a∣ny
thing being done effectually for the resto∣ration
of king James, he followed him to the
court of St. Germains in France, where he
had the honour of the most noble order of
the thistle conferred upon him by that prince,
and died at St. Germains, <HI>anno</HI> 1694, having
married lady Jean Gordon, daughter of George
marquis of Huntly, by whom he had no issue,
whereby the estate and honours (had it not
been for the forfeiture) would have devolved
upon George Seton of Barns, his next heir∣male,
being lineally descended of sir John Se∣ton
of Barns, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>I. Sir JOHN SETON, second son of George
seventh lord Seton, and immediate elder bro∣ther
of Alexander first earl of Dunfermline,
in whose favours the honours of Fyvie were
limited, failing heirs-male of the patentee's
body, as before observed, got from his fa∣ther
the lands and barony of East-barns,
which were given by king Robert Bruce to
the family of Seton, for their good and faith∣ful
services.</P>
<P>He was a man of excellent parts, and in
his travels visited most of the courts in Eu∣rope,
<PB N="222" REF="233"/>
where he was remarkably distinguish∣ed
for his polite behaviour and fine accom∣plishments.
He was so highly esteemed at
the court of Spain, that king Philip II. made
him master of his houshold, one of the gentle∣men
of his bed-chamber, and afterwards cre∣ated
him one of the knights of the order of
St. Jago; in memory whereof, he and his
successors added to their armorial bearing a
sword, which is the badge of that order. King
Philip also settled a pension of 2000 crowns
<HI>per annum</HI> on him and his heirs.</P>
<P>He was at last called home by king James
VI. who did not like to be deprived of the
services of a subject of so much merit; but,
immediately upon his return, appointed him
one of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber,
and comptroller of his exchequer and treasu∣ry
in Scotland.</P>
<P>He married Anne, daughter of William
sixth lord Forbes, by whom he had two sons
and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>George Seton,</HI> Esq;.</P>
<P>His daughter, <HI>Anne,</HI> died without issue.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>II. Sir JOHN SETON of Barns, a man of
Singular honour and loyalty, a firm and stea∣dy
friend of the royal family.</P>
<P>He was one of the gentlemen of the privy∣chamber
to king Charles I. and never desert∣ed
his interest during all the time of the civil
war.</P>
<P>He went over to Ireland with the forces
that were sent to suppress the rebellion there,
where he purchased a considerable estate from
sir Robert Gordon of Lochinvar.</P>
<P>After his return, he joined the marquis of
Montrose, for which he was fined and impri∣soned
by the covenanters, <HI>anno</HI> 1646.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Isabel, daughter of Gil∣bert
Ogilvie of Powrie, widow of Kenneth
lord Kintail, by whom he had a son,</P>

a promising boy, and of a sine genius.
His uncle, Mr. Thomas Murray, who was
preceptor, and afterwards secretary to king
Charles I. introduced the youth to his ma∣jesty.
They were much about an age. He
had his whole education along with the king;
and being of a lively and sprightly disposition,
his majesty conceived a mighty friendship and
affection for him.</P>
<P>Soon after his accession to the crown, he
appointed him one of the gentlemen of his

employed in several negotiations of importance,
during the troubles of that reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parl. ad ann. 1633, Gu∣thrie's me∣moirs, &amp;c.</NOTE> but it ap∣pears
he was not faithful to him, having got
no less than forty thousand merks from the

France, to endeavour to get Scotland com∣prehended
in their treaty with the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 509.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1515; and being a man of extraordi∣nary

Albany, when he went to France to concert
measures about carrying on the war with Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollinshed's history.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1520. He acquitted himself so

<P>He got charters, under the great seal, <HI>Hu∣goni,

governors of Scotland.</P>
<P>He married Marian, daughter of George
lord Seton, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>XVI. HUGH, third earl of Eglington, who
succeeded him. He was a great loyalist, and
adhered firmly to the interest of queen Ma∣ry,
in her greatest distress. He raised for∣ces,
was personally engaged for her majesty
at the battle of Langside, where he was ta∣ken
prisoner, and suffered many hardships on
account of his loyalty; but he afterwards
submitted to king James VI. was received in∣to
favour, and lived peaceably at home ever
after.</P>
<P>He got charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> under the great seal, of
many lands and baronies, between 1578 and
1584.</P>
<P>He married Agnes, daughter of sir John
Drummond of Innerpeffry, widow of sir Hugh
Campbell of Lowdon, by whom he had two
sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Hugh,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert Montgomery</HI> of Giffen, who
married Margaret, daughter of sir Matthew
Campbell of Lowdon, by whom he had one
daughter, Elizabeth, his sole heiress, who was
married to her cousin Hugh earl of Egling∣ton.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> the earl's eldest daughter,
was married to Robert earl of Winton, and
carried on the line of this family; of whom
afterwards.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Agnes,</HI> his second daughter, was mar∣ried
to Robert lord Semple.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Helen, daughter of Gil∣bert
lord Kennedy, but by her had no issue.
After his death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> she married Thomas Gra∣ham
of Knockdolion.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1585, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XVII. HUGH, fourth earl of Eglington,
a youth of great hopes and singular endow∣ments;
but had the misfortune to be mur∣dered,
in the flower of his age, by John Cun∣ningham
of Colnheath and his accomplices,
on the 12th April 1589,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. John¦ston's Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heroes.</NOTE> leaving issue by
Giles his wife, daughter of Robert lord Boyd,
only one son,</P>
<P>XVIII. HUGH, fifth earl of Eglington, who
succeeded him.</P>
<P>He obtained a grant to himself, his heirs
and assignies, upon the resignation of Mr.

that belonged to the dissolved abbay of Kil∣winning,
erecting them into a temporal lord∣ship,
together with the patronages of sixteen

of Giffen, by whom, it is said by for∣mer
historians, he had no issue; but this is
<PB N="231" REF="242"/>
certainly a mistake; for by her he had one
son,</P>
<P>XIX. ROBERT, designed master of E∣glington,
and son of Hugh the fifth earl, who
was put in possession of the lands and barony
of Eastwood in his father's lifetime, and got
two charters of these lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the
great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Roberto, magistro de Eglington,
&amp;c.</HI> but he died before his father, <HI>anno</HI>
1602, leaving issue only one daughter,</P>
<P>XX. Lady MARGARET MONTGOMERY,
who succeeded her father in the lands and ba∣rony
of Eastwood, as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>In a charter under the great seal, granted
to Alexander, sixth earl of Eglington, she was
designed <HI>Domina Margareta Montgomerie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>u∣nica
filia et haeres quondam Roberti Montgo∣merie,
magistri de Eglington, &amp;c.</HI> dated the
penult day of July 1613.</P>
<P>She was married to Robert lord Boyd, but
died without issue. Though she survived her
grandfather several years, and immediately
after his death assumed the titles of Egling∣ton,
as his heir of line, yet she afterwards yield∣ed
them to Alexander, the sixth earl of E∣glington.
This appears by a charter of con∣firmation,
under the great seal, to the said
sixth earl; wherein are these words: <HI>Domina
Margareta Montgomery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>olim comitissa de E∣glington,

March 1615.</P>
<P>Robert, master of Eglington, being now
dead, and no appearance of his daughter la∣dy
Boyd's having any children; and lady Mar∣garet
Montgomery, countess of Winton, be∣ing
heir of line of the family, failing heirs of
Hugh, the fifth earl of Eglington's body,
whereby the estates and honours of Egling∣ton
and Winton would both devolve upon
the eldest son of lady Margaret; the old earl
therefore made a resignation and entail of his
estate and honours (which was afterwards
confirmed by the king) to and in favours of
sir Alexander Seton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> second son of the said lady
Margaret his aunt, dated <HI>anno</HI> 1603.</P>
<P>The earl dying in 1612, was accordingly
succeeded by the said sir Alexander; we must
therefore return to his mother lady Mar∣garet,
who was undoubted heir of line of the
last earl, failing issue of the body of his
grandchild the lady Boyd, as before observed.</P>
<P>XVII. Lady MARGARET MONTGOMERY,
eldest daughter of Hugh, third earl of Egling∣ton,
was married to Robert earl of Winton, to
whom she had several sons.</P>
<P>I. <HI>George,</HI> who succeeded to the earldom
of Winton.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Alexander,</HI> who succeeded to the earl∣dom
of Eglington, in virtue of the above re∣signation
and entail.</P>
<P>XVIII. ALEXANDER, sixth earl of E∣glington,
grandson of Hugh the third earl, thus
succeeding, got a charter, under the great seal,
ratifying and confirming all the honours, dig∣nities,
and precedency, enjoyed by any former
earl of Eglington. The confirmation is sign∣ed
by the king, <HI>apud palatium de Whitehall,</HI>
March 4th 1615; and in the clause of <HI>novo

in the king's service, particularly at the
battle of Dunbar, on the 3d of April 1650,
where he performed the part of a brave and
gallant commander; also at the fatal battle of
Worcester, in 1651, where he was major-general
of the royal army, and behaving like

<HEAD>ELPHINSTONE Lord ELPHINSTONE.</HEAD>
<P>THE traditional account of the origin of
this ancient family, is, that one Peter
d'Aelphingstone, a noble Hungarian, came to
Scotland with queen Margaret, got some lands
in Mid Lothian from king Malcolm Canmore,
which he called after his own name, and that
from him all the Elphinstones in Scotland
are descended.</P>
<P>Others, with more probability, think that
the sirname is local; that these lands had the
name of Elphinstone long before sirnames
were much used in Scotland; and that the
proprietors of that barony assumed their sir∣name
from their lands, as was very custom∣ary
in those early times.</P>

<HEAD>HAY Earl of ERROL.</HEAD>
<P>THE grandeur and antiquity of the great
and illustrious name of HAY being suf∣ficiently
set forth, and attested both by anci∣ent
and modern historians, we shall only hint
briefly at the traditional account of their ori∣gin,
as it is handed down to us by many emi∣nent
authors.</P>
<P>In the reign of king Kenneth III. the Danes
having invaded Scotland, about the year 980,
with a great and numerous army, were op∣posed
by king Kenneth, who gave them battle
near Loncartie, in Perthshire, where the Scots
were worsted and fled.</P>
<P>In their flight through a narrow pass, they
were met by a brave Scotsman, and his
two sons, who were labouring their ground
near by; they stopt them, encouraged them
to rally, telling them it was better and more
honourable to die in the field, fighting for
their king and their country, than to fly, and
afterwards be killed by the merciless Danes:
by thus upbraiding their cowardice, they
were prevailed upon to stop.</P>
<P>There were many gallant men amongst them,
who fled more from the desertion of their com∣panions,
than want of courage They join∣ed
the brave old man and his sons, stopt all
the flyers, and soon got a considerable body
of men together.</P>
<P>The father and his sons having only such
arms as their ploughs furnished them with,
led back their countrymen, who returned to
the charge. They renewed the fight, fell
upon the Danes, and made a most furious on∣set,
crying aloud, Help is at hand. The Danes
believing that a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh army had fallen on
them, soon gave way, whereby the Scots
obtained a compleat victory, and effectually
freed their country from servitude.</P>
<P>The battle being over, the old man (after∣wards
known by the name of Hay,) was
brought to the king, who gave him and his
sons, as a just reward of their valour and me∣rit,
so much land on the side of the river
Tay, in the Carse of Gowrie, as a falcon, set
off a man's hand, should fly over before she
settled. She flew over about six miles of
ground in length, which was afterwards cal∣led
Errol, and has been the possession and
chief title of the Hays their successors ever since.</P>
<P>The king further promoted them to the
order of the nobility, and assigned them a
coat of arms, <HI>viz. argent,</HI> three se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tcheons,
<HI>gules,</HI> to intimate that the father and the two
sons had been the three fortunate shields of
Scotland.</P>
<P>Thus all ancient Scotch authors: But</P>
<P>It appears from many histories, that there
were families of the name of Hay, both in
Italy and France, even before the aera of the
battle of Loncarty. The late countess of Er∣rol,
as head or chief of the Hays in Scotland,
had some time ago a most elegant letter from
the learned—Hay, archbishop of Marnis,
wherein he mentions the above account of
the battle of Loncarty, as a piece of history
contained in the memoirs of the Hays in I∣taly;
but says, that the first of the Hays in
Scotland and Italy came both from Armenia.</P>
<P>There are some other probable accounts
of the origin of this noble family, with which
we shall not trouble our readers here, but re∣fer
to title, marquis of Tweeddale.</P>
<P>In the genealogical account of the family
of Errol, it is said, that the name of the brave
old man, at the battle of Loncarty, was Tho∣mas,
afterwards sirnamed Hay; that the name
of his eldest son was Sereld Hay; and the name
of his second Achaius. These are said to be
the first of the name of Hay in Scotland, and
the ancestors of the Hays of Errol; but as we
have no authentic documents for the next
three or four generations, we shall begin to
deduce the descent of this noble family from
certain authority, <HI>viz,</HI> original charters, and
our public records.</P>
<P>I. WILLIAM de la HAYA, said to be li∣neally
descended of the first Thomas, lived
in the reign of king David I. who succeeded
to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1124, and died in 1153.</P>
<P>This William was a great man at the court
of king Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of the priory of St. Andrews, pe∣nes eom. de Panmure.</NOTE> and is witness in many
of his royal deeds, by the title of <HI>pincerna
domini regis.</HI></P>
<P>In king Malcolm's original charter to the
abbacy of Scoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Scoon, Fol. II. III. and IV. penes vice co∣mit. de Stor∣mont.</NOTE> <HI>Willielmus de Haya,</HI> An∣drew
bishop of Caithness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are witnesses.
The charter is without date, but granted <HI>inter</HI>
1153 <HI>et</HI> 1165, in which last year king Mal∣colm
died.</P>
<P>He is witness also to an order or prohibiti∣on
of the same prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Scoon, Fol. VII.</NOTE> that no person what∣soever
shall molest or distress the abbot of
Scoon, <HI>&amp;c. ante</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He married Julia or Juliana, sister of Ra∣nulphus
de Soulis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartul. of Cupar, Fol. XII.</NOTE> one of the most consider∣able
families in Scotland at that time, by
whom he had a son,</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM de HAYA, who succeeded
him, and made no less a figure at the court
<PB N="248" REF="259"/>
of king William than his father had done at
that of king Malcolm.</P>
<P>He was a witness to that convention be∣twixt
king Henry of England and king Wil∣liam
of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 39.</NOTE> when the latter obtained
his liberty, <HI>anno</HI> 1174.</P>
<P>He appears to have had large possessions in
Perthshire, by the considerable donations made
to the religious by him and his sons.</P>
<P>He gave a grant of some lands to the con∣vent
of Cupar, which is confirmed by king
William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Willielmus de Haya dedisse, &amp;c.

was a man of great probity and merit. He
always continued sirm in the Roman Catho∣lic

who having been brought up at court, and
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>
educated in the protestant religion, was in
great favour with king Charles I.</P>
<P>He acted as constable in Scotland, at his
coronation in the abbay of Holyroodhouse, on
18th June 1633.</P>
<P>He lived in so splendid and grand a man∣ner,
that he brought great incumbrances on
the family, which obliged them to sell their
old paternal estate in the Carse of Gowrie,
reserving only some superiorities, which are
still in the family.</P>

all that was in his power.</P>
<P>He waited on the king at Aberdeen, was
most graciously received, and raised a regi∣ment
for his majesty's service on his own
charges.</P>
<P>King Charles II. being perfectly sensible
of his loyalty, constituted him one of his
privy council, <HI>anno</HI> 1661, and he always
behaved with prudence, candour and mode∣deration.</P>
<P>He married lady Catharine Carnegy, daugh∣ter
of James earl of Southesk, by whom he

<P>Earl John died <HI>anno</HI> 1705, and was suc∣ceded

<P>XIX. CHARLES, thirteenth earl of Errol,
a man of singular honour and probity.</P>
<P>In the parliament 1706, he opposed the
union with all his power and interest, as be∣lieving
it derogatory to the honour and inde∣pendency
of Scotland, and entered a solemn
protest against it, which still remains upon re∣cord,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>

whom, and his descendants, we are now to
treat.</P>
<P>This John, in his early youth, betook
himself to a military life, which so well suit∣ed
his genius, that from an ensign in the foot∣guards,
he rose to the chief command, not
only of all the forces in Great-Britain, but
of the confederate army in Flanders, where
he performed so many great and glorious ac∣tions
in the reign of queen Anne, that if they
were not recorded by many faithful cotem∣porary
historians, posterity would scarce be∣lieve
them.</P>

<P>Philip, a grandson of the house of France, united to
the interests, directed by the policy, supported by the

King William III. beheld this formidable union of two
great, and once rival, monarchies. At the end of a
life spent in defending the liberties of Europe, he saw
them in their greatest danger. He provided for their se∣curity
in the most effectual manner. He took the duke of

<P>His great grand-son, sir William Carey of

<P>II. Sir HENRY CAREY of Berkstead, suc∣ceeded
his father, and was the first who
brought the news of the death of Queen E∣lizabeth
to Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1603, whereupon
king James appointed him one of the gentle∣men
of his bed-chamber, and comptroller of
his houshold.</P>
<P>When his son Charles was created prince
of Wales, sir Henry was made a knight of the
Bath, <HI>anno</HI> 1616.</P>
<P>He was afterwards created a peer of Scot∣land,
by the title of viscount Falkland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> 10th
November 1620; which title, with his na∣turalization,
were confirmed by king Charles
I. by a diploma, <HI>Hemico Carey vicecom. de

<P>And, being a man of great parts and abili∣ties,
was appointed deputy-governor of Ire∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
where he acquitted himself with great
dexterity and moderation.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir

by whom he had a son,</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1633,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE> and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>III. LUCIUS, second viscount Falkland,
a man of great parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and fine accomplish∣ments,
a firm and steady friend of the royal
family. He was chosen member of par∣liament
for Newport, in the county of South∣ampton,
<HI>anno</HI> 1640. And being greatly,
and deservedly, in high esteem with his
majesty, he was advanced to be one of the
principal secretaries of state, upon the remo∣val
of sir Henry Vane, which high office
he executed with universal applause; but
afterwards, out of his great zeal for his maje∣sty's
service, venturing himself too far at the
battle of Newbury, he there lost his life on
the 20th September 1643, in the 34th year
of his age, greatly regreted by the king and
all good men.</P>
<P>We shall sum up that great man's character
in the words of the celebrated author of the
history of the grand rebellion, lord Claren∣don:</P>
<Q><P>"The lord Falkland was a man of im∣mense
wit and judgment, and an admi∣rable
memory, that retained all it read and
heard, which he theatrically set forth
upon every occasion.</P>
<P>He was superior to all those passions and
affections which attend vulgar minds, be∣ing
of that inimitable sweetness and de∣light
in conversation, of so flowing and
obliging goodness to mankind, and of such
integrity of life, that if there was no other
brand upon this odious and cursed civil
war than that one single loss, it must be
infamous and execrable to all posterity."</P></Q>
<P>By Alicia his wife, daughter of Richard
Morison, Esq; of Tooly-park in the county
of Leicester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he had a son,</P>
<P>IV. HENRY, third viscount Falkland, who
succeeded him, and was also a man of great a∣bilities,
and well versed in every kind of li∣terature.
He was a particular friend of the
muses, and a great patron of poetry, of which
his own performances show he was an orna∣ment.</P>
<P>Immediately after the restoration, he was
chosen a member of the house of commons,
for Arundel in Suffex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Eng∣land.</NOTE> and appointed lord Lieu∣tenant
of the county of Oxford, but he died
in the flower of his age, <HI>anno</HI> 1664, as much
missed when dead, as beloved when living, says
our author, leaving behind him a son and
successor,</P>
<P>V. ANTHONY, fourth viscount Falkland,
who, in the latter end of the reign of king
Charles II. and that of king James VII. was
paymaster of the forces.</P>
<P>He came early into the revolution, was

then served queen Mary as steward of her
houshold, came over from France to recover
the estate, which belonged to him by birth∣right,
but was now claimed by the Gordons,
as before mentioned. At this time there ap∣pears
to have been a submission to queen Ma∣ry
of Lorrain, then regent, who pronounced
a decreet-arbitral betwixt the parties. This
decreet-arbitral is not now to be found; but
it is mentioned in the second decreet-arbitral
which restored the estate to the right owner.
This first decreet-arbitral, it would appear,
was unfavourable for James of Cardell, who,
upon queen Mary's coming over from France,
raised a reduction thereof in the courts of
law. These proceedings caused great animo∣sities
betwixt the families of Gordon and O∣gilvie,
in which the friends of both were
mostly embarked. To this was owing the
scuffle that happened in the streets of Edin∣burgh
betwixt John Gordon and the above
James, who is there designed lord Ogilvie of
Airly, mentioned in Robertson's history, vol.
I. page 245.</P>
<P>When queen Mary made her progress in∣to
the north country, she was attended by
James of Cardell, who was extremely active
and instrumental in bringing the MacIntoshes,
and others of his friends, as well as the Ogil∣vies
from Angus, to her assistance.</P>
<P>On the 8th February 1563, queen Mary,
out of her regard to James of Cardell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> grant∣ed
him a charter, under the great seal, of the
lands and baronies of Deskford, Finlater, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">"to James Ogilvie of Cardell, son and heir
of Alexander Ogilvie of that ilk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this charter, it seems the
Gordons still claimed part of the Ogilvies
lands; but at last all differences between the
families were ended by a submission to the
following persons, arbiters, <HI>viz.</HI> James earl of
<PB N="262" REF="273"/>
Bothwell, and sir John Ballenden, justice∣clerk,
on the part of the earl of Huntly, James
and Adam Gordons, his brothers, and William
Maitlend, younger of Leithington, and Mr.
John Spence, his majesty's advocate, for James
Ogilvie, the queen being overs-woman; and
by their decreet-arbitral, which is dated 23d
March 1566, the lands and barony of Desk∣ford,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Decreet. arbi∣tral penes co∣mitem de Fin∣later.</NOTE> as contained in the above charter,
were affirmed to the said James Ogilvie, and
the lands of Auchindoun and Kethmore, to
the said Adam Gordon.</P>
<P>The lands and superiorities in Strathearn
and Strathnaven, and the other lands in the
shires of Nairn and Inverness, had been seiz∣ed
by the Gordons, at the same time that
they took possession of the rest of the estate
of this family. These lands and superiorities
came soon thereafter into the hands of the
regent, earl of Murray, and have been pos∣sessed
by that family ever since; but there is
no distinct, or at least certain, account of the
cause of the regent's getting possession of them.</P>
<P>He was one of those Scotch barons who
entered into an association to stand by and
support the queen with their lives and for∣tunes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. in the lawiers libra∣ry Edinburgh.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1568.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Janet, daughter of sir Ro∣bert
Gordon of Lochinvar, without issue; he
married, 2dly, dame Marian Livingston, of the
family of Linlithgow, one of the ladies who
attended queen Mary to France; and it is of
her the family was continued. Amongst the
family papers is a charter, 13th of February
1558, of the lands of Findochty, granted to
him and her by Mr. George Hay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes comitem de Finlater.</NOTE> rector of
Rathven, and a charter of confirmation there∣of
by Francis and Mary, 20th June 1559.</P>
<P>By the said dame Marian Livingston, his
second wife, he had a son,</P>
<P>VI. ALEXANDER, who married Barbara
Ogilvie, daughter of sir William Ogilvie of

with the approbation of the crown, succeeded
to the honours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 247.</NOTE> as before observed, and was
the second earl of Finlater.</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and merit, a
steady loyalist, and suffered many hardships
on account of his attachment to the interest
of the royal family. He was excepted from
pardon by Oliver Cromwell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's act of indem∣nity.</NOTE> and fined in fif∣teen

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1711, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, fourth earl of Finlater, born
<HI>anno</HI> 1664, a man of extraordinary parts, rare
accomplishments, and great knowledge of the
laws.</P>
<P>Immediately after his return from his tra∣vels,
he entered advocate with great applanse,
<HI>anno</HI> 1685, and was chosen member to the
convention of estates for the burgh of Cullen,
<HI>anno</HI> 1689, where he made a remarkable
speech in favours of king James VII. and was
one of the five members that dissented from
the act for forfeiting him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 247.</NOTE> but after the go∣vernment
was settled under king William, he
went into all the measures of the court, and
soon became a favourite of his majesty; and
being an eminent lawyer, was made sollicitor
for the crown, sheriff of Banff, and knighted
<HI>anno</HI> 1693.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1695, he was appoint∣ed
secretary of state, in conjunction with the
earl of Tullibardine, afterwards duke of A∣thole,
who having resigned, he acted as sole
secretary until lord Carmichael was joined
with him.</P>
<P>In the year 1698, he was appointed pre∣sident
of the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Finlater.</NOTE> (the earl of March∣mont
chancellor, being then commissioner)
and he was at the same time created viscount
Seafield.</P>
<P>In 1700, he was appointed his majesty's
high commissioner to the general assembly of
the church of Scotland, and was thrice pre∣ferred
to the same high dignity afterwards,
<HI>viz.</HI> in 1703, 1724, and 1727.</P>
<P>In 1701, he was created earl of Seafield.</P>
<P>He continued secretary of state all king
William's reign; and upon queen Anne's
accession, that office was continued to him
until November 1702, when he was made
chancellor.</P>
<P>In 1703, he was made a knight of the
thistle; and in 1704, he was again made se∣cretary
of state, in conjunction with the duke
of Roxburgh, and at the same time he pre∣sided
in parliament.</P>
<P>In the same year 1704, he was again ap∣pointed
chancellor: in which office he con∣tinued
till the union was compleated, having
been first commissioner for Scotland at the
treaty of union, and presided in the Scotch
parliament that ratified it.</P>
<P>In 1708, he was appointed chief baron of
the court of exchequer in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> with a
salary of 3000 <HI>l. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>After the union took place, he was appoint∣ed
one of the privy council in England, and
was continued to be one of that number all
his life. He was chosen one of the sixteen
Scotch peers to the first British parliament,
and was re-elected to the second, third, sixth,
and seventh.</P>
<P>In 1713, he was again appointed chancel∣lor,
and keeper of the great seal in Scotland;
and during all the periods in which he enjoy∣ed
the office of chancellor, he presided in the
court of session. In which learned court, he
remarkably displayed his eloquence, and great
abilities in the law, and a peculiar talent of
dispatch in business, and shortening law suits.</P>
<P>The family estate having been reduced by
cautionry, and other incidents, so low as to
be almost bankrupt, he paid all his father's
<PB N="263" REF="276"/>
debts without composition; and though he
lived always in a manner suitable to his high
stations, yet by a prudent oeconomy, he great∣ly
increased his family estate.</P>
<P>This earl of Finlater and Seafield married
Anne, daughter of sir William Dunbar of
Durn, baronet, by whom he had two sons
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> now earl of Finlater.</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1730, and was succeeded by

<P>XIII. JAMES, fifth earl of Finlater and
Seafield. In the year 1734, he was chosen
one of the sixteen peers, and made one of
the lords of police.</P>
<P>In the year 1737, he was promoted to be
vice-admiral of Scotland; in which office he
has continued ever since.</P>
<P>He was chosen one of the sixteen peers for
Scotland to all the successive parliaments un∣til
the 1761, when, by reason of his age, he
chose to retire from public business; but be∣cause
of the zeal he had shown upon every
occasion for the service of the present royal
family, and the preservation of the constituti∣on,
his majesty has been graciously pleased to
continue him in the office of vice-admiral.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Elizabeth Hay,

<P>THAT this noble and ancient family
hath flourished in Scotland above five
hundred years, appears both from our histo∣ries
and records, though some traditional ac∣counts
deduce their origin and descent much
higher.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin of Clermont, a learned and ju∣dicious
antiquary, says, that one Solvathius
Forbes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's gen. collect. v. II. p. 17.</NOTE> married Moravilla, daughter of king
Gregory the great, about the year 870, and
that all the Forbes's in Scotland are descend∣ed
of him.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="277"/>
Other historians say, that one Achonacher,
a man of rank, who came from Ireland, hav∣ing
killed a monstrous wild boar, took the
name of For-bear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 327.</NOTE> which was afterwards turn∣ed
to Forbeas; that he was ancestor of the
Forbes's, and that they took the boar's head
for their armorial bearing, in memory of their
having killed the boar.</P>
<P>Cambden says, that one of the name of
Bois, in king John Baliol's time, after kil∣ing
a mighty wild boar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd. fol. edit. p. 712.</NOTE> was called For-bois,
which afterwards was turned to Forbes; but
this must be a mistake, (at least as to the
aera,) for there were Forbes's in Scotland long
before that time.</P>
<P>It is alledged by others, with more probabi∣lity,
that Forbes is a local sirname, and was first
taken up by the proprietors of the lands and
barony of Forbes, soon after the reign of king
Malcolm Canmore, about which time several
men of rank in Scotland assumed their sir∣names
from the lands they possessed, and were
progenitors of some of the most considerable
families in the kingdom.</P>
<P>We shall therefore pass over the tradition∣al
accounts, and deduce the descent of this
noble family, by authentic documents, from
the first of them we find upon record, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>I. JOHN de FORBES, a man of rank and
figure, who flourished in the reign of king
William the Lion. He possessed the lands and
barony of Forbes, and was father of,</P>

<P>He le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. ALEXANDER FORBES, who was a

a true lover of his country. He was captain
and governour of the castle of Urquhart, which
he gallantly defended against king Edward I.

In the end the castle was taken by

was delivered of a son, who succeeded him,

<P>IV. ALEXANDER FORBES, when a young
man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lumisden's M. S. hist. of the family of Forbes, Scots compend. and chart. penes dom. Forbes.</NOTE> joined king Robert Bruce, performed
many brave actions in his service, and never
deserted his interest; for which, and in re∣gard
of the great sufferings of his family, and
his own eminent loyalty, he obtained a grant
of several other lands from that great monarch,
to him and his heirs for ever.</P>
<P>He was no less faithful to king David
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem and Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> and adhered firmly to his interest, till
he lost his life in his service at the fatal battle
of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI> 1332.</P>

without success. Lord Forbes carried with
him, in his own retinue, forty launces and one
hundred horse, which sufficiently shews the
grandeur of this family at that time; and it
was chiefly owing to his valour, lord Gordon's,
and some others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. II. p. 256.</NOTE> that the Scots obtained a

<HEAD>MACDUFF Thane and Earl of FYFE.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are many full and elaborate ac∣counts
of this great and antient fami∣ly,
wrote by good historians, we shall here
briefly deduce their descent from the best au∣thorities.</P>
<P>Fifus Duffus, or Fyfe MacDuff, was a
man of vast wealth and power in the reign of
king Kenneth II. and gave that prince great
assistance in his wars with the Picts, about
the year 834.</P>
<P>After they were subdued (about the year
840) king Kenneth gave to this MacDuff, in
reward of his great and eminent services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Bal∣four's descrip∣tion of Fife.</NOTE> all
the lands then called Otholinia, which he
himself had conquered from the Picts, which
extended from Fife-Ness to Clackmannan,
from east to west, from the river Forth on
the south, to the river Tay and Earn on the
north.</P>
<P>This great tract of land he called Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, af∣ter
his own name, according to these words
of Boethius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boeth. lib. X. p. 199.</NOTE> <HI>regio ad id tempus Otholinia a
Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Duffo, in Fifi nomen concessit, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As he was now proprietor of all Fyfe, he
was also appointed heretable thane thereof,
the highest jurisdiction then known in Scot∣land
under our kings; which dignity was en∣joyed
by his posterity in a direct male-line to
that hero and eminent patriot MacDuff, the
eighth thane, and first earl.</P>
<P>I. MACDUFF, eighth thane, afterwards
earl of Fyfe, was one of the greatest and most
powerful subjects in the kingdom; and as he
was no less good than great, he was conse∣quently
much dreaded by MacBeath the usur∣per.</P>
<P>The great share he had in bringing about
king Malcolm Canmore's restoration, and his
killing MacBeath with his own hand, are facts
so well known, that it is needless here to in∣sist
on them.</P>
<P>And as Malcolm was a prince both gene∣rous
and grateful, he did not fail to reward
his benefactor according to his merit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. I.</NOTE> He
confirmed to him the county of Fyfe, and cre∣ated
him earl thereof at his first <HI>conventus pro∣cerum</HI>
held at Forfar, <HI>anno</HI> 1057; or, accord∣ing
to others, <HI>anno</HI> 1061.</P>
<P>He likeways conferred on him many great
and noble privileges, all to descend to his po∣sterity,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1st, To have the honour of placing the
kings of Scotland in the chair of state at their
coronation.</P>
<P>2d, That they should lead the van of the
royal army in the day of battle.</P>
<P>3d, That if any within the ninth degree
of relation to his family, should be guilty of
man-slaughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. I. p. 252.</NOTE> he should be free by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lying to
Cross MacDuff (a sanctuary or place of girth)
upon paying twenty-four merks of silver for
the death of a gentleman, and twelve for that
of a plebeian, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This last privilege was often claimed and
obtained; particularly by sir Hugh Aberne∣thy,
sir Alexander Murray of Abercairny,
Spens of Wormiston, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This great man was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>II. DUFFAGAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Scoon, penes vicecom. de Stormont, &amp; sir James Dal∣rymple's col∣lections.</NOTE> second earl of Fyfe, who

<P>She married; 3dly; sir Thomas Bysset of

<HEAD>CUNNINGHAME Earl of GLENCAIRN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS noble family is of very great anti∣quity
in the west of Scotland, but our
antiquaries are not agreed about their origin.</P>
<P>Frederic Van Bassen, a learned Norvegi∣an,
who wrote an account of the origin of
several Scotch families,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. in the advocate's library, Edr.</NOTE> says, that one Mal∣colm
son of Friskin, assisted Malcolm prince
of Scotland, (afterwards king Malcolm Can∣more)
to make his escape from the tyranny
of Macbeath, who had murthered his father
king Duncan; and, being hotly pursued, he
took shelter in a barn, where Malcolm con∣cealed
the prince, by forking straw or hay
over him. The pursuit being over, the prince
made his escape to England, accompanied by
his faithful Malcolm.</P>
<P>Prince Malcolm was no sooner in possessi∣on
of his kingdom, than he rewarded his
preserver with the Thanedom of Cunning∣hame,
from which his posterity assumed their
sirname, and took a shake-fork for their arms,
with <HI>Over fork over</HI> for their motto, to per∣petuate
the memory of this happy escape.</P>
<P>Cambden says, that the Cunninghames
came originally from England, which possi∣bly
may be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, fo∣lio edition, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>3.</NOTE> for there came several persons
of rank from that country to Scotland, with
king Malcolm Canmore, and we find Cun∣ninghames
settled in the shire of Ayr, very
soon thereafter.</P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie is of opinion, that the
sirname is local, and was first assumed by the
proprietors of lands in Cunninghame, where
the ancestors of this noble family had great
possessions in very early times; and having
the office of master of horse in the king's sta∣bles,
took for their armorial figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacKenzie's heraldry.</NOTE> the in∣strument
wherewith hay is thrown up to the
horses, <HI>viz.</HI> a shake-fork, with <HI>Over fork over</HI>
for their motto: but we shall submit these con∣jectural
accounts to the judgment of our read∣ers,
and deduce the descent of this illustrious
family, by authentic documents, from the first
of them we find upon record, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>He was one of the privy council to king
Charles I. from whom he got a ratification
of the titles and honours of Glencairn, as con∣ferred
upon his predecessor Alexander the first
earl, by king James III. his majesty's <HI>atavus,</HI>
in which all the privileges, dignities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
his former patent are fully narrated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Williel∣mo

<P>He got also other two charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> under the
great seal, <HI>Willielmo comiti de Glencairn,</HI> of
several lands.</P>
<P>Though this earl did not appear to act stre∣nuously
for his majesty's interest, in the be∣ginning
of his troubles, yet he was far from
engaging on the other side.</P>
<P>In the convention 1643, he joined the
duke of Hamilton, and others, and vigorous∣ly
opposed the nation's sending an army into
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> to join the parliament's forces un∣der
the obligation of the solemn league and
covenant, for which he had a letter of thanks
under his majesty's own hand, acknowledging
the service he had done him, and assuring him
he never would retract any thing he had grant∣ed,
either in religion or liberty, to his subjects
in Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The original letter is still
preserved in the family.</P>
<P>Upon the death of sir Thomas Hope of
Carse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he was made justice-general, in 1646.</P>
<P>In 1648, he was very zealous in engaging
the nation to endeavour to rescue the king
from his confinement.</P>
<P>He was deeply concerned in duke Hamil∣ton's
engagement, for which, after the duke's
deseat, the then ruling faction turned him out
of his office of justice-general, and conferred
it upon the earl of Castilis.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he got a
commission from king Charles II. appointing
him general and commander in chief of all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orces he could raise for his majesty's service,
which, upon general Middleton's arrival, he
willingly resigned in his savours.</P>
<P>In 1653, he received a new commission
from king Charles II. impowering him to
raise men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he effectually did, and
gave great uneasiness to general Monk; in
consequence whereof he received a letter un∣der
king Charles's own hand from Paris,
which is still preserved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 217. and 218.</NOTE> is very honourable for
the family, and may be seen in the lives of

as also the above-mentioned letter from king
Charles I. together with a full account of this
great man's conduct.</P>
<P>We shall only add, that, immediately af∣ter
his majesty's restoration, the earl, in con∣sideration
of his many faithful services, was
made sheriff of Air, and bailie of the stew∣arty
of Kyle, in October 1660, and was
constituted lord high chancellor of Scotland,
on 19th of January 1661, which high of∣fice
he exerced with honour and reputation
till he died in July 1664.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Anne Ogilvie, daugh∣ter
of James earl of Finlater, by whom he
had four sons, and four daughters.</P>

succeeded by his third son,</P>

co-heiress of sir James Stewart of Strabrock
and Kirkhill, by whom he had but one daugh∣ter,</P>

<HEAD>GORDON Duke of GORDON.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH there are many elegant hi∣stories
of this ancient and illustrious fa∣mily,
written by learned and judicious anti∣quaries,
yet they differ greatly as to their
origin and first settlement in this island.</P>
<P>Some bring them from Greece to Gaul, and
from thence to Scotland, at least a thousand
years ago; others bring them from Italy; o∣thers
from Spain, Flanders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Certain it is, there were many consider∣able
families of the name of Gordon in
France, long before the Norman conquest of
England, whose posterity we shall have occa∣sion
to mention hereafter, and whose descen∣dents
are subsisting in France to this day.</P>
<P>The most probable conjecture therefore is,
that some of these Gordons came to England
with William the Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, and
to Scotland with king Malcolm Canmore, or
his son king David I. for it is well known,
that the ancestors of several of the best fami∣lies
in this kingdom are of Norman extract,
and came to Scotland with one or other of
these princes.</P>
<P>It is also said, that in the reign of king
Malcolm Canmore, a valiant knight, of the
name of Gordon, came to Scotland, and was
kindly received by that prince; and having
killed a wild boar, which greatly infested the
borders, the generous Malcolm gave him a
grant of several lands in the Merse, or Ber∣wickshire,
which he called Gordon, after his
own sirname. He settled there, took the
boar's head for his armorial bearing, in me∣mory
of his having killed that monstrous ani∣mal;
that he was progenitor of all the Gor∣dons
in Scotland; and mention is made of
Adam de Gordon the father, and Adam his
son, in the reigns of the said Malcolm and
David.</P>
<P>It is most certain the Gordons were mak∣ing
no small figure in Scotland immediately
after that aera; we shall therefore insist no
more on the historial accounts; but proceed
to deduce the descent of this great and most
noble family, by unquestionable authority,
from their immediate ancestor.</P>
<P>I. RICARDUS de GORDON, said to be
grandson of the knight who killed the boar,
or son of the second Adam. He was a man
of considerable distinction in Scotland in the
reigns of king Malcolm IV. and king William
the Lion, who succeeded Malcolm, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He was undoubtedly proprietor of the
lands and barony of Gordon, and others, in
Berwickshire, which is instructed by a dona∣tion
he made, <Q REND="inline">"To St. Mary's church of
Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, in the Lawyer's lib∣rary, Edin. and printed in the appendix to Mr. Gor∣don's hist. of the family of Gordon.</NOTE> and the monks serving God there,
and to the church of St. Michael in his
village of Gordon, (a bounded piece of his
lands and estate of Gordon, lying contigu∣ous
to the church-yard of Gordon,) in a
free and perpetual alms; and grants to
whatever minister they shall place in the
said church of Gordon, all the ordinary
privileges of pasturage, moss, muir, and
other conveniencies that the inhabitants of
the lands of Gordon enjoyed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This deed has no date, but by the subse∣quent
confirmations, appears to have been
made <HI>inter</HI> 1150 <HI>et</HI> 1160.</P>
<P>He died about the year 1200, and was suc∣ceeded
by his son,</P>
<P>II. Sir THOMAS de GORDON, who, by
his charter, confirms all the donations made
by his father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to God and St. Mary's church
at Kelso, and to the Monks serving God
there, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that in as full, free, and ample
a manner as expressed in the deeds of his fa∣ther;
and he is then designed <HI>Thomas de
Gordon, filius Ricardi, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Cotemporary with this Thomas, there
flourished in France, Bertram de Gordon, who
wounded with an arrow king Richard I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hovedon's hi∣story, p. 791.</NOTE> of
England, before the castle of Chalons, of
which he died, <HI>anno</HI> 1199.</P>
<P>About this time lived also Adam de Gor∣don
in Scotland. This appears by a charter
of confirmation, in which Richard bishop of
St. Andrews confirms to the abbacy of Kelso,
in a free and perpetual alms, the church of
Gordon, with the whole of its parish, (<HI>viz.</HI>
of Gordon and Spotiswood,) and in which he,
at the desire of the abbot and monks, point∣ed
out a church-yard or burial place to that
parish;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, and Gordon's ap∣pendix.</NOTE> but granting liberty to the inhabi∣tants
of the other half of the lands of Gor∣don,
belonging to Adam de Gordon, to take
their sacrament, and bury either there, or, at
their pleasure, in their mother-church of
Home, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Richard was bishop of St. Andrews, from
1163 to 1178, so this deed must have been
made within that space.</P>
<P>If this Adam was not a younger son of
Richard, he was certainly a near relation of
the family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and chartul. of Cold-stream.</NOTE> seeing he possessed part of the lord∣ship
of Gordon. He is a frequent witness in
charters and donations to the monastery of
Kelso, in the reign of king William the Lion,
<PB N="296" REF="309"/>
and was probably grandfather of Adam, who
married the heiress Alicia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thomas died in the reign of king Alex∣ander
II. and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>III. Sir THOMAS de GORDON, who, by a
charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> confirms to the monks and abbot
of Kelso, all the donations and concessions
made to them by Richard de Gordon his
grandfather, and Thomas his father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In two other charters granted by him, with
consent of Marjory his wife, to the said ab∣bot
and monks of Kelso, for the salvation of
his own soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Gordon's ap∣pendix.</NOTE> and that of his wise and daugh∣ters,
his ancestors and successors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he con∣firms
all his father's and grandfather's donati∣ons,
and grants them several other privileges
and possessions, in his lordship of Gordon, and
commits his body to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Coldstream.</NOTE> to be buried at
Kelso as they shall see meet.</P>
<P>He also makes a donation to the religious
at Coldstream, of pasturage upon the lands of
Thorndyke and Gordon, <HI>tempore Alexandri
II.</HI> and is then designed <HI>filius domini Thomae,
militis.</HI></P>
<P>This sir Thomas is mentioned in two other
charters to the monastery of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1258,
in which he is designed <HI>dominus Thomas de
Gordon, miles, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Pontius de Gordon, of a considerable fa∣mily
in Normandy, lived about this time.
In a convention with king Henry III. of Eng∣land,
this Pontius did homage to king Henry,
<HI>pro castro et honore de castellania de Gordon,</HI> in
Normandy, and for all his other castles and lands
which he held of the king of France, and that
he shall hold these lands in the same manner of
the king of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 761.</NOTE> as he held them former∣ly
of the king of France, for which king Hen∣ry
grants him many noble privileges, <HI>anno</HI>
1263.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas de Gordon had no male issue,
and was succeeded in his whole lands and e∣state
by his daughter,</P>
<P>IV. ALICIA de GORDON,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Coldstream and Kelso.</NOTE> who, in many
charters, is designed daughter and heiress of
sir Thomas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>She married her cousin Adam de Gordon,
who, in the beginning of the reign of king
Alexander, in a donation to the monastery of
Coldstream, is designed <HI>Adam filius Adae de
Gordon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and was probably the grandson of
Adam, proprietor of part of the estate of Gor∣don,
before mentioned; by which marriage
the whole lordship of Gordon was now uni∣ted
in one family.</P>
<P>This Adam mortified to the monastery of
Dryburgh, a bounded piece of land, lying in
his territory of Fawns, in Berwickshire, for
the salvation of his own soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dryburgh pe∣nes MacFar∣lane.</NOTE> the soul of Alicia
his spouse, his ancestors and successors, <HI>&amp;c.
ante annum</HI> 1270.</P>
<P>When king Alexander III. sent one thou∣sand
auxiliaries to king Lewis of France, to
attend him in his expedition to the Holy
Land, <HI>anno</HI> 1270, Adam de Gordon was
one of the chief commanders, and lost his
life in that enterprise, leaving issue by the
said Alicia, a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Adam,</HI> their heir.</P>
<P>Alicia survived her husband, which ap∣pears
by her charter of confirmation to the
religious in Kelso, in these words: <HI>Alicia de
Gordon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, and Gordon's ap∣pendix.</NOTE> <HI>filia et haeres quondam domini Thomae
de Gordon, militis, in pura viduitate, &amp;c. pro
salute animae meae et animarum fratris mei, et
Adae de Gordon quondam sponsi mei, &amp;c. confir∣masse,
&amp;c. omnes donations, &amp;c. a domino Ri∣cardo
proavo meo, five a domino Thoma quondam
avo meo, five a domino Thoma quondam patre
meo, &amp;c.</HI> to which deed her seal is appended.</P>
<P>V. ADAM, designed <HI>dominus de Gordon,</HI>
succeeded Adam and Alicia, his father and
mother, and confirms all the donations of his
predecessors to the religious at Kelso.</P>
<P>This Adam appears to have had some pro∣perty
in England, whether his own inheri∣tance,
or in right of his wife, who was an
English lady, cannot now be determined;
but in a writ, dated at Westminster the 14th
June 1287, he, as a subject of England, is
ordered to meet Edmund earl of Cornwall,
king Edward's lieutenant, at Glocester, in or∣der
to give advice and assistance in certain
great affairs of state, which should be com∣municated
at meeting, but whether he obey∣ed
the summons or not is uncertain.</P>
<P>He was always on the Baliols side, which
probably proceeded both from inclination and
interest, for most of his lands then held of
that prince, or of the earls of March, his fast
friends; but he died before king John (as
he is then called) resigned the sovereign∣ty
of Scotland to king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom, II. p. 727.</NOTE> for Mar∣jory
his wife obtained a safe conduct from
king Edward to go up to England, and is
then designed <HI>Uxor quondam Adae de Gordon,
anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>By the said Marjory, (but of what family
we know not) he left issue a son and succes∣sor,</P>
<P>VI. Sir ADAM de GORDON, <HI>dominus
ejusdem,</HI> who was certainly one of the great∣est
men of that age, being equally qualified
for the cabinet and the field.</P>
<P>As all the Gordons in Scotland appear to
be descended of this sir Adam, and as he is
<PB N="297" REF="310"/>
variously represented by different authors,
we shall endeavour to trace his conduct, step
by step, from authentic documents, and submit
his character to the judgment of our readers.</P>
<P>The first appearance he makes is, his assisting
the brave sir William Wallace, then guardian
of Scotland, in his expedition into Galloway,
who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> having made himself master of the castle
of Wigton, gave the keeping of it to sir A∣dam,
<HI>anno</HI> 1297.</P>
<P>About that time he acquired the lands of
Glenkenns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. fam. de Kenmure.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Galloway, which he gave
to his second son William, as will be shown
hereafter.</P>
<P>He was afterwards appointed warden of the
marches by the guardians of Scotland, in the
absence of John Baliol then their king;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> for to
him is intimated, as warden aforesaid, a truce
concluded betwixt Scotland and England, at
Dumfries, 30th October 1300.</P>
<P>In 1305, sir Adam, for being along with
John Cummin lord of Badenoch, sometime
guardian of Scotland, is fined by king Edward
of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> then acting as over-lord of Scot∣land,
in three years rent of his estate, for ad∣hering
to the Baliol's party.</P>
<P>In 1308, sir Adam de Gordon, John de
Moubray, Alexander de Abernethy, Robert de
Keith, and Henry Haliburton, are sureties for
the good behaviour of William bishop of St.
Andrews, whose relief out of prison they had
procured.</P>
<P>About this time sir Adam settled a difference
that had long subsisted, betwixt him and the
abbot and convent of Kelso, whereby he got
liberty to build a chapel for the use of his fa∣mily,
in any place of his parish of Gordon he
should think fit:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, and Gordon's ap∣pendix.</NOTE> he then made a donation to
the church of Kelso, with consent of Anabel∣la
his wife, of a bounded piece of ground on
his lands of Gordon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and he is there de∣signed
<HI>filius et haeres quondant Adae, &amp;c.</HI> 1308.</P>
<P>In January 1312, David earl of Athole,
sir Adam de Gordon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III. p. 300.</NOTE> and Alexander de Aber∣nethy,
are appointed plenipotentiaries by king
Edward, to treat of a peace with king Robert,
which at that time took no effect.</P>
<P>In April 1313, he, with the earl of March,
were sent to England by Baliol's party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to en∣deavour
to get some of their grievances re∣dressed.</P>
<P>And in November thereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he is again
employed by king Edward to negociate a
peace with king Robert, which was the last
of his actions in favours of the Baliol party. King
John died in 1314, and we find sir Adam e∣ver
after, one of king Robert's firmest and
most respected friends.</P>
<P>He obtained from Thomas Randolph, earl
of Murray, a grant of the lands and barony of
Stitchell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes dom. Rober∣tum Pringle de Stitchell.</NOTE> in Roxburgh-shire, which king Ro∣bert
ratified and confirmed to him and his son
William, by his charter, dated at Perth, 28th
June 1315.</P>
<P>King Robert knowing sir Adam to be a
man of great abilities, joined him in commis∣sion
with sir Edward Odard de Mombuisson,
to go to Rome, to manage the affair of his ex∣communication
with the pope;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun.</NOTE> and they car∣ried
with them that famous letter from the
nobility of Scotland to his holiness, asserting
the independency of their country, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>King Robert afterwards, in reward of his
faithful services, gave a grant to him and his
heirs, of the noble lordship of Strabolgie,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Aberdeen-shire, then in the crown
by the forfeiture of David de Strabolgie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> earl
of Athole, which was afterwards confirmed to
his family, by several charters under the great
seal, as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>Sir Adam fixed his residence there, and
gave these lands and lordship the name of
Huntly, which hath been one of the chief
titles of his family ever since.</P>
<P>By the said Annabella his wife, he left is∣sue
four sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> to whom he gave the lands
of Glenkenns in Galloway, and Stitchell in
Roxburgh-shire, of whom the family of Ken∣mure,
aud several others in the south of Scot∣land,
are descended. <HI>Vide</HI> title viscount Kenmure.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>The last two went into the service of the
church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III, p. 396.</NOTE> and obtained letters of recommenda∣tion
to the pope, from king Edward of Eng∣land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1313.</P>
<P>His daughter <HI>Mary,</HI> was married to sir Walter
Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ro∣tul. Rob. 1.</NOTE> ancestor of the duke of Hamilton,
as appears from a charter under the great seal,
<HI>anno</HI> 1319.</P>
<P>Sir Adam was at last killed in the service
of his king and country, at the battle of Ha∣lidon-hill,
<HI>anno</HI> 1333, and was succeeded by</P>
<P>VII. Sir ALEXANDER GORDON, now de∣signed
of Huntly, a great patriot, a firm and
steady friend to king David Bruce, and who had
behaved gallantly at the battle of Halidon∣hill,
where his father was killed, though he
had the good fortune to escape.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. II. p. 98.</NOTE></P>
<P>He attended king David in his unfortunate
expedition into England, and was slain at the
battle of Durham, where his royal master
was taken prisoner, <HI>anno</HI> 1346.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VIII. Sir JOHN GORDON of Huntly, who
was also a great loyalist, and was taken priso∣ner
<PB N="298" REF="311"/>
with king David, at the foresaid battle of
Durham.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. VI. p. 30 &amp; 82.</NOTE> He was not released, till the be∣ginning
of 1357, and then the earl of Dou∣glas
was one of his sureties, where <HI>Elizabetha
uxor Johannis de Gordon,</HI> is mentioned.</P>
<P>He obtained from the said king David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Gordon.</NOTE> a
confirmation of the lands and lordship of Strath∣bogie,
which had been granted by king Robert
I. to his grandfather, (<HI>avo suo</HI>) dated 20th
March 1358.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, leaving issue by the
said Elizabeth, a son and successor.</P>
<P>IX. Sir JOHN GORDON of Huntly, a great
warrior, and of an undaunted spirit. He with
his own vassals and followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie vol. II. p. 171</NOTE>, routed a consi∣derable
body of the English, under the com∣mand
of sir John Lilburn, whom he took pri∣soner
at Carram, <HI>anno</HI> 1372.</P>
<P>Immediately after this he surprised and took
prisoner sir Thomas Musgrave,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 172.</NOTE> governor of
Berwick, but released him soon thereafter.</P>
<P>He got a new charter from king Robert
II. confirming the lands and lordship of Strath∣bogie,
to him and his heirs, <HI>quas terras, Ro∣bertus

after which he was designed lord Gordon of
Strathbogie or Huntly.</P>
<P>In the year 1378, sir John Gordon, along
with the earl of Douglas came up with another
considerable body of the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie vol. II. p. 178.</NOTE> under the
command of sir Thomas Musgrave, and killed
or took prisoners every man of them.</P>
<P>This great man lost his life with his
brave general the earl of Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gordon shist. of this family, vol. I. p. 30.</NOTE> at the bat∣tle
of Otterburn, <HI>anno</HI> 1388.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>X. Sir ADAM GORDON, <HI>dominus de</HI> Gor∣don
and Huntly, who was inferior to none of
his brave ancestors in magnanimity and cou∣rage.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir Wil∣liam
Keith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. &amp; Craw∣furd's peer∣age.</NOTE> great marishal of Scotland, by
whom he had only one daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth</HI> his sole heiress.</P>
<P>He was killed at the battle of Homildon,
<HI>anno</HI> 1402, and was succeeded in his whole
great and opulent estate by his daughter,</P>
<P>XI. ELIZABETH, who married sir Alex∣ander
Seton, second son of sir William Seton
of that ilk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Gordon, et in pub. archiv.</NOTE> ancestor of the earls of Winton,
who thereupon got charters from Robert duke
of Albany, governor of Scotland, of the baro∣nies
of Gordon, Huntly, and many others, <HI>A∣lexandra Seton, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was afterwards designed Alexander Se∣ton,

a man of great parts and abilities.</P>

This Alexander lord Gordon having per∣formed
many great services to his country, in

prince created earl of Huntly, <HI>anno</HI> 1449, the
honours being limited to the heirs-male of his
last marriage with Elizabeth Crichton, they
being obliged to carry the name and arms
of Gordon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

one of the earl of Douglas's chief asso∣ciates,

<P>He married Jean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist. of the royal fam. p. 83.</NOTE> natural daughter of king

<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> afterwards earl of Huntly.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Alexander,</HI> who, by queen Mary, was

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1517.</P>
<P>XVI. GEORGE, eldest son of John lord
Gordon, succeeded his grandfather earl Alex∣ander,
<HI>anno</HI> 1523, and was fourth earl of
Huntly.</P>
<P>He was a man of a sine genius, and excel∣lent
natural parts, which were greatly improv∣ed
by a liberal education and travelling.</P>
<P>He got charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> under the great seal, of a
vast number of lands, lordships and baronies,
<HI>inter</HI> 1530 <HI>et</HI> 1540.</P>
<P>In 1535, the king appointed him one of
his privy council, and also constituted him one
of the regency, when he went to France, in
order to espouse princess Magdalene, daugh∣ter
of king Francis I. The lords regents were
James archbishop of St. Andrews, Gavin
archbishop of Glasgow, chancellor, George
earl of Huntly, William earl of Montrose,
Hugh earl of Eglington, and Robert lord
Maxwell, whose ample commission is fully
narrated in the lives of the officers of state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, page, 82.</NOTE>
and is dated at Stirling, 29th August 1536.</P>
<P>The king, upon his return, having entire
confidence of the loyalty and fidelity of this
earl, constituted him lieutenant of the north,
and captain-general of the forces that were
raised to oppose the English under the com∣mand
of sir Robert Bowis, whom he pursued
closely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 83.</NOTE> defeated the whole party at Halden∣rig,
and took their general prisoner.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. then sent a much greater
force to the borders, under the command of
the duke of Norfolk; but the brave earl
of Huntly, by his prudence, dextrous conduct,
and frequent skirmishes, so hemmed him in,
that he never durst advance two miles on this
side of the Tweed.</P>
<P>After the death of the king, the earl of
Huntly was, by act of parliament, appointed
one of the lords of the privy council, to the
earl of Arran, the governor; and upon the
death of Cardinal Bethune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and records of par∣liament.</NOTE> he was constitut∣ed
lord high chancellor of Scotland: his com∣mission,
and the great seal were delivered to
him in open parliament on 10th June 1546.</P>
<P>He had a considerable command at the un∣fortunate
battle of Pinkie; and though he be∣haved
with the utmost conduct and resoluti∣on,
was taken prisoner, and sent to England;
but made his escape from Morpeth about one
year thereafter, returned immediately to Scot∣land,
and went directly upon the administra∣tion
of the chancellor's office.</P>
<P>He always strenuously opposed the match
betwixt queen Mary and the prince of Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and accompanied the queen dowager to
France, when she went to visit her daughter;
was made a knight of the antient order of St.
Michael by king Francis I. and upon his return,
had a grant of the earldom of Murray, then
in the crown, by the death of earl James, the
queen's natural uncle.</P>
<P>When the queen dowager was made re∣gent,
she gave the great seal to Monsieur
Rubie, a Frenchman; which, upon queen
Mary's return from France, was delivered
back to the chancellor, but her Majesty was
pleased to give the earldom of Murray to her
natural brother the prior of St. Andrews, and
created him earl of Murray; between whom
and the chancellor, there was always a mor∣tal
enmity.</P>
<P>When the queen went on an expedition to
visit the northern parts of her dominions, it was
alledged the earl had amind to apprehend her
majesty's person, and get her out of the hands
of the earl of Murray;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state. p. 87.</NOTE> he had got together
about 1500 men, but the queen having been
joined by some MacKenzies, Monros, Frasers,
and MacIntoshes, attacked Huntly near Cor∣richie,
where he was deseated, and himself kill∣ed,
<HI>anno</HI> 1562.</P>
<P>His son, sir John, was executed the next
<PB N="301" REF="314"/>
day at Aberdeen; another of his sons, sir A∣dam,
was pardoned; but the earl's estate and
honours were forfeited to the crown for trea∣son,
though her majesty was pleased to re∣verse
the forfeiture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and records of par∣liament.</NOTE> and restore his son to the
whole estates, honours, and dignities of the
family, <HI>anno</HI> 1567.</P>
<P>By Elizabeth, daughter of Robert lord
Keith, son and apparent heir of William third
earl Marishal, he had issue seven sons and three
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> afterwards earl of Huntly.</P>
<P>2. Mr. <HI>James,</HI> who went into holy orders,
and died at Paris, <HI>anno</HI> 1620.</P>

Boyne.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to John earl
of Athole.</P>
<P>XVII. GEORGE, fifth earl of Huntly, was
restored to all his estates, and honours of his
ancestors, <HI>anno</HI> 1567, as before observed.</P>
<P>Though his forfeiture was not reversed in
parliament till 1567,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> yet we find him in
great favour with her majesty before that
time, who appointed him lord high chancel∣lor
of the kingdom, on 20th march 1565;
which high office he held till the queen re∣signed
the government;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and lives of the officers of state.</NOTE> then the earl of
Murray conferred it upon his good friend the
earl of Morton.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he adhered to the queen's interest with great
firmness and fidelity, and was appointed com∣mander
in chief of all the forces raised, or
to be raised in the north for her majesty's
service. He soon got together a considerable
body, both of horse and foot, which gave the
other party a great deal of trouble; but they
being strongly supported by the queen of Eng∣land,
Huntly was forced to come to an ac∣commodation
with the earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and re∣cords of parlt.</NOTE> then
regent, <HI>anno</HI> 1573.</P>
<P>The earl after this retired to his country
feat, where he lived all the rest of his days,
without meddling any more in publick af∣fairs.</P>
<P>He married lady Anne Hamilton, daughter
of James duke of Chattelherault, by whom he
had a son,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to George earl of
Caithness.</P>
<P>He died in May 1576, and was succeeded
by his son,</P>
<P>XVIII. GEORGE, sixth earl of Huntly, who
continuing steady in the Roman catholick re∣ligion,
he, the earls of Angus, Errol, and
others, were unjustly suspected to have had
some correspondence with the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 198 and 305.</NOTE> a∣bout
the time of their armado, and of course
became obnoxious to the court.</P>
<P>The king was very sensible that these noble
earls were no enemies, either to himself or the
country, but were only arming in defence of
their religion and estates, and was unwilling
to drive them to extremities. The earl of
Bothwell was then in actual rebellion; the
king, therefore, in the beginning of the year
1594,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 247.</NOTE> proposed that the general assembly
should order it to be intimate from the pul∣pits,
that he was determined to prosecute, ac∣cording
to law, the earl of Bothwell, and all
his rebellious subjects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The ministers answered, and insisted, that
he should first prosecute the enemies to God
and religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 248.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the earls of Angus, Huntly,
and Errol, the laird of Strathdon, and sir James
Chisholm, and then prosecute the traitors and
rebels against himself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There was therefore an army levied, and
sent north against these earls, under the com∣mand
of Archibald earl of Argyle, the king's
lieutenant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scots hi∣storians.</NOTE> They came to an engagement
near Glenlivet; the king's troops were de∣feated,
and some persons of rank killed on
both sides, in October 1594</P>
<P>However, the earls were soon thereafter
pardoned, and Huntly got so much into the
king's favour, that he obtained from his ma∣jesty
a grant of the dissolved abbacy of Dun∣sermline,
was constituted lord lieutenant of
the north, and raised to the honour of mar∣quis
of Huntly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by patent, dated 17th April
1599.</P>
<P>He got charters, under the great seal, <HI>(Geor∣gio

and baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1608 <HI>et</HI> 1625.</P>

who was a great loyalist, and inviolably
attached to the interest of the royal family.</P>
<P>While a young man, he was a captain of
the Scotch gens d'armes to Lewis the XIII. of
France; but upon the breaking out of the
civil war, he returned to his native country,
joined the loyalists, and was appointed lieute∣nant
in the north;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> and for his steady adhe∣rence

<P>This earl, who was truly a great man, had

<P>XVI. JAMES, eldest son of William, first
earl of Gowrie, by the king's great lenity and
goodness, was restored to his father's estate
and honours, and was the second earl.</P>
<P>He was a youth of great hopes, and of a
sweet disposition; but died unmarried, <HI>anno</HI>
1588, whereby the estate and honours de∣volved
upon his brother,</P>
<P>XVI. JOHN, third earl of Gowrie, who,
with his brother Alexander, made that auda∣cious
attempt upon the king's sacred person
at Perth, on the memorable fifth of August
1600, when both the brothers were slain in
the enterprize.</P>
<P>Though there are particular histories of
Gowrie's conspiracy wrote by several histo∣rians,
yet we have only hereto subjoined the
account given by a learned author.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>No transaction in the Scotch history can be so little accounted for, as that of Gowrie's conspiracy. A reason for an attempt so horrid, is scarcely so much as hinted; and the methods used, even supposing such had been the intention, were so preposterous, that it cannot reconcile, either with the character of the two young gentlemen, or with the other circumstances of the story itself. Nature and education had joined in adorning them, especially the elder, with the most noble accomplishments: More learned than is usual among persons of their rank; more religious than is common at their age of life; generous, brave, popular: their country-men, far from thinking them capable of any atrocious crime, conceived the most sanguine hopes of their early virtues.</P>
<P>This remarkable incident happened on the fifth August 1600. Historians tell us, that as the king was going out in the morning to the chace from his palace of Falkland, he was accosted by the younger of the two Ruthvens, Alexander, who, with an air of secrecy and importance, acquainted him, that the evening before, a stranger had been seized near his brother's house at Perth, and secured; and, on searching him, a vast quantity of foreign gold was found upon him. The king immediately suspecting this unknown person to be a trafficking priest, supplied with foreign coin, in order to excite new commotions in the kingdom, ordered him to be sent to Falkland; but this Mr. Ruthven strenuously opposed, and, with many arguments, urged the king to proceed to Perth, and examine into the matter himself. The king, whose curiosity was awakened by the strangeness of the affair, promised to go when the chace was over, during the whole of which Ruthven continued his importunity in so strong at manner, that, even after it was over, he would not allow the king to wait a fresh horse, but insisted on his setting out on the same he had hunted with the whole day. Mr. Ruth∣ven, too, was very desirous that the king should set out without attendants; but this he refused, and, with a train of about twenty persons, set out for Perth.</P>
<P>The earl of Gowrie apprised by his brother of the king's approach, met him at a little distance from the town, and conducted him to his house: mean time no preparations for entertaining his majesty appeared; the earl seemed em∣barassed, nor did he apologize for the seanty fare with which he entertained his royal guest. The king's repast be∣ing over, his attendants were conducted by the earl to dine in another apartment. At that time Mr. Ruthven took the opportunity of whispering the king, that now he might have an opportunity of seeing the unknown person. The king desired sir Thomas Erskine to go with him; but Mr. Ruthven would not consent: he then conducted the king by a narrow stair-case, through several apartments, all of which he locked behind him, till at last he came to a small room, where, instead of a fettered criminal, as the king expected, he found a man standing compleately armed, with a sword and dagger at his side. Ruthven, upon his entrance, snatched the dagger from the man's side, and addressing the king, spoke to him of his father's execution; that he was now his prisoner, and at his mercy; but added, that if he would be quiet, and make no noise, his life should be in safety. He then delivered back the man the dagger, told him to take care of the king, and at same time binding the king with an oath not to make any noise or disturbance during his absence, he returned to acquaint his brother with what he had done.</P>
<P>Mean while the king's attendants, impatient at his not appearing, inquired at Gowrie what had become of him: at that instant one of Gowrie's domestics entered the room, and acquainted them, that the king had just mounted his horse, and rode off for Falkland; on which all of them immediately left the house, and called for their horses. At this time Mr. Ruthven had returned to the king, and told him, that now he behoved to die, and at same time offer∣ed to bind his hands. Unarmed as the king was, he would not submit to such an indignity, but closing with Mr. Ruthven, a fierce struggle ensued; during which the man in armour stood by trembling, dismaid, and motionless, without offering the least assistance to his master, or violence to the king.</P>
<P>In the scuffle the king had pulled Mr. Ruthven near a window, part of which was open, and, putting out his head, called out, with a wild affrighted voice, Treason! Murder! His attendants knew the voice, and observing a hand at the window, collaring the king, they immediately rushed up stairs to his assistance. The greater number took the principal stair-case, but found all the doors fast, which while they were attempting to force open, sir John Ramsay entered by a back stair, and seeing Mr. Ruthven struggling with the king, drew his dagger, plunged it twice into his body, then pulled him from the king, and threw him down stairs, where he was met by sir Thomas Erskine, and sir Hugh Herries, who, with their daggers, dispatched him; Mr. Ruthven calling out with his last breath, alas! alas! I am not to blame. During this scuffle the man in armour, who had been concealed in the apartment, made his escape unknown.</P>
<P>There were now in the apartment with the king, Ramsay, Erskine, and Herries, and one Wilson a footman, who en∣tered the room along with them. Before they had time to congratulate the king on his narrow escape, the earl came up the same back-stair, and rushed in with a sword in each hand, attended by seven servants, compleatly armed, threat∣ening them all with immediate death. Notwithstanding the inequality of the numbers, the three gentlemen immedi∣ately attacked the earl, and sir John Ramsay having run him through the heart, his followers immediately fled.</P>
<P>The king's attendants, who were endeavouring to force a passage from the other stair-case, were now let in, and, with transports of joy, congratulated the king on his deliverance; and he falling on his knees, with his attendants a∣round him, offered thanks to God for his wonderful preservation.</P>
<P>The danger however was not quite over: the inhabitants of Perth hearing of the death of the earl, their beloved provost and patron, surrounded the house, and vowed vengeance against the king; but the magistrates being admitted into the king's presence, and acquainted with the fact, they, by their influence, by degrees appeased the multitudes, who soon after dispersed. The king then returned to Falkland, having left the care of the dead bodies of the earl and his brother to the magistrates.</P>
<P>Such is the story handed down to us by many writers; but all of them are at a loss to account for the motives of a conduct so contrary to the known character of these two brothers, whose gentle and peaceable dispositions made them idolized by all who knew them.</P>
<P>Three of Gowrie's servants were afterwards hanged at Perth, for being concerned in the attempt; but from them no light could be drawn into this intricate affair; and the man who was concealed in the study, and who, upon promise of pardon, had revealed himself, and proved to be the earl's steward, was as much a stranger to his master's design as the rest; and though placed in the study, by the earl's immediate command, he did not even know for what end that station was assigned him; the truth of which seems strongly to appear from his behaviour to the king while alone in the apartment with him; and when, instead of appearing to have a design upon his life or liberty, he stood motion∣less, trembling and affrighted; in short, altogether unfit for so horrid an office.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>All the honours and estates of the earldom
<PB N="307" REF="320"/>
of Gowrie were forfeited and annexed to the
crown, and the fifth of August in time coming
ordered to be regularly observed as a day of

<HEAD>GRAY Lord GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH Scotch and English antiquaries
agree, that the noble and antient sir∣name
of Gray is originally from France; and
that Fulbert, great chamberlain to Robert
duke of Normandy, got from that prince the
castle and honour of Croy, <HI>alias</HI> Gray, in Pi∣cardy,
from which he assumed his sirname.</P>
<P>This Fulbert had a son,</P>
<P>John lord Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of England, vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE> who succeeded him,—and
a daughter,</P>
<P>Arlette, who was mother of William the
Conqueror.</P>
<P>Certain it is there were several of that sir∣name
came from France to Britain with that
great prince, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, and had considerable
commands in his army; and as he divided the
lands of England amongst his brave officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
we find that the Grays got a large share, made
a great figure, and became very numerous
soon after William was master of the country.
They were progenitors of several noble families
that have flourished with great lustre in that
kingdom ever since,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salmon's a∣bridgment, p. 124.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the dukes of Suffolk,
and Kent, the marquis of Dorset, the earls of
Tankerville, and Stamford, the barons Gray
of Codnor, Ruthin, Wilton, Roleston, Wark,
and Chillingham, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from which last is de∣scended
the lord Gray in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the northern counties there are still ma∣ny
antient families of that name, which en∣joy
considerable estates, as appears from the
acts of parliament, nominating the justices of
the peace, commissioners of supply, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
those parts.</P>
<P>And it is observable, that the Grays in Scot∣land
carry the same armorial bearings with
those in the north of England, which may be
seen in their churches, tomb-stones, and other
monuments of antiquity: and as Northum∣berland
formerly belonged to Scotland, it is
the general opinion, that lord Gray of Chil∣lingham
of that county, (whose predecessor
came over with William the Conqueror,) gave
the lands of Browfield or Broxmouth, in the
county of Roxburgh adjoining to it, to a
younger son of his family, of whom all the
Grays in Scotland are said to be descended.</P>
<P>But both Scotch and English historians,
who assert, that the Grays came first into
Scotland in the reign of king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, Boethius, Bu∣chanan, &amp;c.</NOTE> are in
a mistake; for we have undoubted proof,
that they were settled and making a figure in
this country near two hundred years before
that aera; or, above five hundred years ago.</P>
<P>And though we cannot six the precise time
of their coming, yet we shall deduce the de∣scent
of this noble family, by authentic docu∣ments,
in a direct line from</P>
<P>I. Sir HUGH de GRAY, a man of consi∣derable
rank and figure in the reign of king
Alexander II. (who succeeded to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 1214;) was then proprietor of the lands
of Browfield or Broxmouth in Roxburgh∣shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 173.</NOTE>
and is particularly documented by a
charter of Walter de Lundin to his kinsman
Philip de Feodary, ancestor of the Meldrums
of that ilk, of the lands of Balcormack in
Fife, in which sir Hugh de Gray, Alexander
earl of Buchan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes dominum de Lundin, and Book of ori∣ginal writs, penes Mac∣Farlane. vol. II. p. 1.</NOTE> William lord of Brechin, sir
Philip de Melville, and several others were
witnesses; and his being therein designed <HI>do∣minus
Hugo de Gray,</HI> and inserted before some
other honourable persons, is a sufficient proof,
that he was a man of the first rank; and it is
not to be imagined he was the first of this fa∣mily
that was settled in Scotland. This char∣ter
is without date; but, by the witnesses,
must have been before 1248.</P>
<P>He left issue three sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Hugh de Gray.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Henry de Gray,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lections, vol. III. p. 658.</NOTE> who swore fealty to
king Edward I. of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>

to the monastery of Coldstream;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. of Col∣dinghame pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 15, 35, &amp;c.</NOTE> par∣ticularly
to one of Patrick earl of March, to∣gether
with Philip de Halyburton, Adam de

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>II. Sir HUGH de GRAY, <HI>dominus de Brox∣mouth,</HI>
who flourished in the reign of king A∣lexander
III. and survived him many years.</P>

will be shown hereafter: and as he was eldest
son and heir of sir William Gray of Pitten∣drum,
who made a considerable figure in his
time, and of whom the present lord Gray is
lineally descended, I hope we shall be par∣doned
for briefly inserting here some part of
that gentleman's descent and character.</P>
<P>Sir William Gray of Pittendium, (descend∣ed
of Alexander Gray of Schives, grand-son of

Andrew, second lord Gray, as before noticed,)
was bred a merchant in Edinburgh, by which
employment he acquired vast riches to him∣self
with a fair character, and did great ser∣vice
to his country in the mercantile way.</P>
<P>He got charters, under the great seal, of
many lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Willielmo Gray de Pittendrum
mercatori burgen. burgi de Edinburg, anno</HI>

<P>He was a man of great sagacity, singular
worth and merit, and highly esteemed by
king Charles I. who created him a knight
baronet.</P>
<P>He was a great loyalist, and suffered many
hardships on that account.</P>
<P>He was fined in an hundred thousand merks
by the parliament at St. Andrews, for corre∣sponding
with Montrose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, at the de∣sire
of general Lesly, was carried prisoner to
the castle of Edinburgh, till he should pay the
sum; but, upon application of his friends to
the committee of estates, it was modified to
thirty-five thousand merks, which was in∣stantly
paid by his son the master of Gray,
upon which he was liberate on the 15th A∣pril
1646.</P>
<P>There was afterwards extorted from him,
by way of loan, the sum of ten thousand
pounds sterling, which was never re-paid.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1648, having married dame
Giles Smith, sister to sir John Smith of Gro∣tel,
provost of Edinburgh, by whom he had
five sons, and ten daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>William,</HI> who married Anne mistress
of Gray.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert,</HI> whose son, John Gray of Crie∣chie,

<P>1st daughter, <HI>Agnes,</HI> married to Archibald
earl of Roseberry, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We now return to the family.</P>
<P>Andrew, eighth lord Gray, died in an
advanced age, <HI>anno</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>XVII. ANNE, mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tress of Gray, his daugh∣ter
and heiress, married to William Gray,
younger of Pittendrum, as before observed,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This William, upon the resignation of his
father-in-law, got a patent under the great
seal, (in which the great loyalty and services
to the crown, by the lords Gray his predeces∣sors,
are fully narrated,) <Q REND="inline">"to and in favours
of William Gray, eldest lawful son and ap∣parent
heir of sir William Gray of Pitten∣drum,

<P>The diploma is dated 8th January 1639,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
which was afterwards ratified in parliament,

<P>The master was likeways a great loyalist,
and strongly attached to the interest of the
royal family. He had the command of a regi∣ment
in the king's army at the battle of Wor∣cester,
mostly raised upon his own charges,

Richard de Fawnys, and his uncle Adam Faw∣nys,

</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="peerage">
<HEAD>FALCONER Lord HALKERTOUN.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this family is of very great an∣tiquity,
and hath flourished long with
lustre in the north of Scotland, yet we cannot
pretend to give so full an account of it as could
be wished, one of their chief seats having been
accidentally burnt down, wherein most of their
ancient writs were destroyed, <HI>anno</HI> 1679.</P>
<P>The following descent therefore is chiefly
documented from the writs of other families,
and our public registers.</P>
<P>The first of them we have upon record is,</P>
<P>I. WALTERUS, who appears to have been
a man of rank and figure, and flourished in
<PB N="323" REF="336"/>
the reigns of king David I. and Malcolm IV.
which last succeeded to the crown of Scot∣land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>His sirname, according to sir George Mac∣Kenzie,
was Loncorp; and in Crawfurd's
peerage of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genealogical collect. in the lawyers lib. Edin.</NOTE> he is called <HI>Walterus de
Lenorp;</HI> but none of these are right.</P>
<P>He was possessed of an estate in the shire
of Kincardin, <HI>viz.</HI> the lands of Lunkyir, (now
Longair) from which he derived his sirname,
as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>II. RANULPHUS, or RANULFUS, design∣ed
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lius Walteri de Lunkyir,</HI> who obtained the
office of king's falconer from king William the
Lion, from whom he got a charter of the
lands of Luthra, Balbegno, and several others,
lying in the shires of Kincardin and Mearns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
near the castle of Kincardin, where king Wil∣liam
often resided, in which he is designed
<HI>Ranulfus filius Walteri de Lonkyir, falconarius
noster, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From which office he assumed the sirname
of Falconer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 353.</NOTE> and the armorial bearing of the
family, both ancient and modern, alludes to
that office.</P>
<P>The lands of Luthra, which seems to be so
called from its situation on the water of Lu∣ther,
and Rath or Ra, which signifies a town
or farm, is said to have had its name changed
long ago to Halkertoun or Hawkertoun, from
the office of its proprietor, which hath conti∣nued
to be the chief title of the family ever
since.</P>
<P>He left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. WALTERUS, promiscuously designed
<HI>Le Falconer, et de Lunkyer, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He is witness to the charter of vendition
of the lands of Drumsleid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Arbroath, pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 48.</NOTE> <HI>in vicecom. de Kin∣cardin,
circa</HI> 1250, in which he is designed
<HI>Walterus de Lunkyir, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert le Falconer.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Petrus Falconer,</HI> who is mentioned in
two donations to the abbacy of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, penes eund. p. 132 and 151.</NOTE> with
Galsrede de Lempetlaw, chamberlain of Scot∣land,
<HI>circa</HI> 1260.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IV. ROBERT le FALCONER, who is the
first we find designed by the title of Halker∣toun.</P>
<P>He, together with William, Thane of Mo∣thes,
and Dovenald,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes dominum de Culravock:</NOTE> Thane of Calder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were called to estimate the valuation of the
barony of Culravock and Geddes, <HI>anno</HI>
1295.</P>
<P>He was then possessed of a considerable e∣state,
which appears from his being obliged
to swear fealty to king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne, vol. III. p. 651, 661, &amp;c.</NOTE> of England,
for lands lying in different counties, in 1296.</P>
<P>He died about 1320, and left issue a son
and successor,</P>
<P>V.—FALCONER of Halkertoun,
whose christian name we have not found up∣on
record; but he seems to have been in fa∣vour
with king David Bruce, which appears
by the care and kindness he shewed to his in∣fant
son and heir,</P>
<P>VI. DAVID FALCONER of Halkertoun,
who succeeded him, and to whom king Da∣vid
stood god-father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. reg. Da∣vid.</NOTE> and shewed a paternal
concern for him, by settling a pension of eight
pounds sterling <HI>per annum</HI> upon him, (a con∣siderable
sum in those days,) by his charter,

dated <HI>anno</HI> 1365.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VII. ANDREW FALCONER of Halkertoun,
who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Murray, pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 187.</NOTE> in his father's life time, was designed by
the title of Lethenbar, and was one of the
north-country barons that attended Alexander
Stewart earl of Buchan, lord of Badenoch,
fourth son of king Robert II. when he was
the king's lieutenant on the north-side of
Forth, 11th October 1380.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>VIII. ALEXANDER FALCONER of Hal∣ertoun,
who succeeded him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and, in his fa∣ther's
life time, was designed by the title of
Lethins, a barony which hath been long in

<P>He married—, daughter of—,
by whom he had issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert Falconer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> who obtained a char∣ter

<P>He founded, and amply endowed the col∣legiate
church at Hamilton, <HI>anno</HI> 1451, and
dying in 1460, was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VIII. JAMES, second lord Hamilton, who
was a man of remarkable courage and con∣duct,
which he manifested upon many occasi∣ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and was in so great favour with king
James II. that he was called to his privy coun∣cil
when but a young man, <HI>anno</HI> 1440; and
being no less a good statesman than a brave
soldier, he was often employed in negotiations
of importance, particularly <HI>anno</HI> 1461, 1471,
and 1472; in which last year he was appoint∣ed
one of the ambassadors extraordinary to
the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 476, 716, 740, &amp;c.</NOTE> and met lord Howard,
and the English commissioners, on the borders,
and acquitted himself greatly to the king's sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>He was now possessed of a vast estate, which
appears by his charters in the public records,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
<HI>inter</HI> 1460 <HI>et</HI> 1470.</P>
<P>And being one of the greatest men in the
kingdom, and highly esteemed by the king,
he was pleased (in consideration of his emi∣nent
qualities, and great and faithful services)
to bestow upon him in marriage his eldest sister
<PB N="330" REF="343"/>
lady Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist. of the royal family, p. 69.</NOTE> then widow of Thomas Boyd,
earl of Arran, who died at Antwerp, <HI>anno</HI>
1471. To which princess he was married
with consent of parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1474.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great seal, from
king James III. to James lord Hamilton, and
his dearest sister Mary Stewart, to them and
their heirs-male,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Ha∣milton.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the lands of Kinncil,

and, by him, was great grandmother of
Henry lord Darnly and duke of Albany, who
married Mary queen of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist. p. 154 &amp; 155.</NOTE> and by her
was father of king James VI.</P>
<P>He got another charter from the king, <HI>Ja∣cobo

<P>He died in November 1479, and was suc∣ceeded
by his only son,</P>
<P>IX. JAMES, third lord Hamilton, and first
earl of Arran, who, being endowed with all
the princely qualities suitable to his high
birth, was particularly distinguished, and ta∣ken
notice of by king James IV. and was ap∣pointed
one of his privy council before he was
twenty-one years of age.</P>
<P>He was insest in the heretable sheriffship of
Lanark, and all the rights and privileges there∣to
belonging, 1st August 1489.</P>
<P>He got a charter of the lands and barony
of Kinneil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dated 28th April 1490.</P>
<P>Also a charter of the lands of Padoeruke,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dated 30th May 1498.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1502, he was sent to England to ne∣gotiate
a marriage betwixt his royal master
and princess Margaret,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 45.</NOTE> eldest daughter of
king Henry VII. of England, which he hap∣pily
concluded, <HI>anno</HI> 1503.</P>
<P>He solemnized and celebrated the nuptials
with such splendour and magnificence, that
the king, in recompence of his good services,
and the great expence he had been at, be∣stowed
upon him the island of Arran, and
created him earl thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scots com∣pend. p. 57, &amp; Chart. in pub. arch.</NOTE> by patent, dated the

<P>He also obtained a commission of justiciary

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1504, he got the command of the
forces that were sent to the assistance of king
Christiern II. of Denmark; which service he
performed with conduct and fidelity.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter he got the command
of four thousand auxiliaries that were sent to
France to the assistance of Lewis the XII.
where he gained immortal honour.</P>
<P>After the death of king James IV. in the
fatal field of Flowdon, <HI>anno</HI> 1513, the earl of
Arran was become so very popular, that he
stood fair to have been elected regent and
governour to the young king, but he gene∣rously
yielded his pretensions to his cousin∣german
John duke of Albany, who indeed
had the better title, being in the same degree
of propinquity to the royal family in the male
line that the earl was in the female.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> He was
then appointed captain and governour of the
castle of Edinburgh.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1517, when the duke of Albany went
to France, to renew the ancient league, which
had subsisted so many centuries betwixt the
two crowns, he nominated six guardians, who
were to take care of the state, and govern by
turns during his absence, <HI>viz.</HI> the earls of Ar∣ran,
Angus, Huntly, Argyle, and the archbi∣shops
of St. Andrews and Glasgow. He also
joined to them his trusty friend sir Anthony
Darcy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 222 &amp; 225.</NOTE> le sieur de la Beauti, on whom he

<P><PB N="331" REF="344"/>
2. Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> married to Alexander fifth
earl of Glencairn.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1530, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>X. JAMES, second earl of Arran, who
got charters from king James V. <HI>Jacobo comi∣ti
Arraniae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>domino Hamilton, &amp;c. terrarum ba∣roniae
de Machanshire, Drumsargard, Stanhouse,

and many other lands, too numerous to be here
inserted.</P>
<P>He was a man of consummate prudence,
honour and integrity, and was in great favour
with king James V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hawthorn∣den's hist. p. 268.</NOTE> whom he accompanied
to France, when he espoused Magdalene, el∣dest
daughter of king Francis I. <HI>anno</HI> 1536.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1539, he had the honour to stand
godfather to James duke of Rothsay, eldest
son of the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 274.</NOTE> by his second wife Mary of
Lorrain, daughter of Rene, and sister of Fran∣cis
duke of Guise, widow of Lewis duke of
Longueville, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After the death of king James V. <HI>anno</HI>
1542, he was chosen guardian to the young
queen, and governor of Scotland, and was, by
an act of the three estates, declared next heir
to the crown, failing issue of queen Mary:
to which act the seals of the noblemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes ducem de Hamilton.</NOTE> pre∣lates,
barons, and members of the burrows in
parliament assembled, are appended, 13th of
March 1543.</P>
<P>About this time there was a match propo∣sed
betwixt Mary queen of Scotland and prince
Edward of England, which the earl of Arran
agreed to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 4.</NOTE> believing it might put an end to
the wars and perpetual sends that had so long
subsisted betwixt the two nations; but the
earls of Huntly, Argyle, Montrose, Bothwell,
Menteith, lord Fleming, and many other
worthy Scotsmen opposed it strenuously, be∣ing
convinced that it would prove derogatory
to the dignity and independency of Scotland,
so that it could never be got accomplished,
though king Henry VIII. had it very much at
heart.</P>
<P>There was then a treaty on foot with the
English, the articles whereof were agreed to
by a Scotch parliament; king Henry not only
refused to ratify it, but caused seize several
Scotch ships, laden with Scotch and French
commodities, upon the faith of the treaty,
which they thought was concluded. This no∣torious
violation of the articles, the governor
resented highly; and in December 1543, cal∣led
a parliament, who declared the treaty
void and null, and the governor immediately
raised what forces he could to oppose the En∣glish,
who had invaded our country with an
army of seven or eight thousand men, under
the command of lord Evers. The Scots en∣countered
them near Ancrum, in Teviotdale,
with an army not half their number, and to∣tally
defeated them.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter the earl of Hertford
invaded Scotland with another army, and the
governor being now joined by 3500 French
auxiliaries, marched to oppose them; but up∣on
the approach of the Scots, the English re∣treated.</P>
<P>The governor, in his turn, invaded Eng∣land,
defeated the English wherever he met
them, and returned crowned with laurels, and
his soldiers laden with great booty. He had
then the ensigns of the most noble order of
St. Michael sent him from France by king
Francis I. <HI>anno</HI> 1546.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. dying in January there∣after,
the duke of Somerset, protector of Eng∣land,
and tutor to king Edward VI. invaded
Scotland with a powerful army, supported by
a strong fleet. The governor of Scotland en∣countered
them at Pinky-cleugh, where the
Scots behaved with the utmost courage and
resolution, but being overpowered by num∣bers,
were at last totally defeated, and about
8000 of them killed in the field, on 10th
September 1547.</P>
<P>The governor, not at all dismayed with
this loss, appointed a meeting of the nobility
at Stirling, and, in a most pathetic speech, he
first condoled with them for their loss at Pin∣ky,
then he put them in mind of the great
spirit and magnanimity with which their an∣cestors
had defended themselves, and main∣tained
their independency against their im∣placable
enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This had such an ef∣fect
upon them, that they unanimously resolved
rather to hazard all than submit to the English.</P>
<P>They then applied to their old allies the
French; and, at the same time, proposed a
match betwixt their young queen and the
dolphin, son of king Francis I. who was then
pleased to create the governor duke of Chat∣telherault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extract from the register of the parliament of Paris.</NOTE>
with a revenue of 30,000 livres <HI>per
annum,</HI> to enable him to support that dignity,
to him and his heirs for ever.</P>
<P>The duke of Chattelherault, the governor,
after several conventions with the English
commissioners in 1551 and 1552,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom XV. p. 263, 319, 326, &amp;c.</NOTE> at last con∣cluded
a treaty with them, and settled the
marches on the borders, in December 1552.</P>
<P>The duke Cattelherault continued gover∣nor
of Scotland till the year 1555, and then
resigned, in full parliament, to the queen's mo∣ther,
when his whole conduct was approven
of; and he was again declared next heir to the
crown, failing heirs of the queen's body, after
he had delivered up the <HI>regalia</HI> and ensigns of
government.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="345"/>
When queen Mary returned from France,
<HI>anno</HI> 1561, the duke of Chattelherault, who was
a great friend to the reformation, was appoint∣ed
one of the privy council; and, in 1566,
was sent to France to take care of her maje∣sty's
interest there, where he continued till
the queen was forced to make a resignation of
the government in favours of her son: up∣on
which he was called home to be head of
the loyalists. He used all his interest to get
the earl of Murray degraded, and did every
thing in his power for her majesty's service;
but at last, when he found that all attempts
to get the queen restored to the government
were in vain, he entered into an agreement
with the regent, for himself, the earl of Cassilis,
lord Herris, and others of the queen's friends,
the articles whereof are at large in Crawford's
peerage of Scotland, page 197, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon the
faith of which, the duke came to Edinburgh,
trusting to the regent's engagements, but was
no sooner in his power, than he was confined
in the castle of Edinburgh, where he was kept
prisoner till the regent was put to death by
James Hamilton of Bothwelhaugh, on 23d
January 1570.</P>
<P>The earl of Lennox being then made re∣gent,
the duke, with his two sons, and many
more of his name and family, were outlawed
and forfeited: however, the duke continued
firm and steady in the queen's interest to the
very last; and, for his untainted loyalty, shar∣ed
greatly in her majesty's misfortunes; but
being now old and infirm, he retired to France,
where he remained till the heat of the civil
war was over, and died soon after his return
home, <HI>anno</HI> 1575.</P>
<P>By lady Margaret Douglas, his wife, eldest
daughter of James earl of Morton, he left is∣sue
sour sons and sour daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his successor.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>John,</HI> afterwards marquis of Ha∣milton,
who carried on the line of this family,

<P>3. Lord <HI>Claud,</HI> ancestor of the earl of A∣bercorn.

<P>4. Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> married to Hugh earl of
Eglington.</P>
<P>XI. JAMES, third earl of Arran, and ele∣venth
duke of Chattelherault, was a youth of
great hopes and expectations, and seemed to
inherit all the virtues of his worthy ancestors.
He went to France <HI>anno</HI> 1555, was much ta∣ken
notice of by king Henry II. who made
him captain of his Scotch life-guards; but
some time thereafter he came to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE>
turned melancholy, retired from the world,
died without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1609, and was suc∣ceeded
by his nephew James, son of his bro∣ther
lord John, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XI. Lord JOHN, afterwards marquis of
Hamilton, second son of James second earl of
Arran,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. arch. and se∣veral charters penes ducem de Hamilton.</NOTE> and duke of Chattelherault, born <HI>anno</HI>
1532, was appointed commendator of Ar∣broath,
by king James V. <HI>anno</HI> 1541, by
which title he was designed for many years
thereafter.</P>
<P>He was most zealous in support of the queen's
cause, in opposition to those who assumed the
government in the name of king James her
son; was deeply engaged in the civil wars that
ensued thereupon, and never deserted the in∣terest
of queen Mary, in her deepest distress.</P>
<P>When she was carried prisoner to the castle
of Lochleven, the commendator entered into
that memorable association, with several o∣thers
of the nobility, obliging themselves to
stand by one another in defence of the queen,
and to endeavour to procure her liberty at
the hazard of their lives and fortunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
for which, and his other acts of loyalty, he,
with his brother lord Claud, was, by the rul∣ing
faction at the time, outlawed and sorfeit∣ed,
as before hinted, <HI>anno</HI> 1570.</P>
<P>He then made his escape to France, where
he continued in banishment for several years;
and the queen was so sensible of his unshaken
fidelity, that when that cruel sentence of death
was passed upon her in England, she pulled a
ring off her finger, and ordered one of her ser∣vants
to deliver it to her cousin lord John Ha∣milton,
as a token of the just sense she had
of his constant fidelity and sufferings for her
interest; which ring is still preserved in the
family.</P>
<P>When he heard that the king had begun
to take the management of affairs upon him∣self,
he returned to Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1585; and
being joined by his brother lord Claud, with
several others of the nobility, they advanced,
with what forces they could raise, to Stirling,
where the king then was, and represented to
him, that as their enemies had contrived their
ruin, and had deprived them of all other
means of imploring his protection, they were
reduced to the hard neceslity of coming in
that manner. They were then admitted into
<PB N="333" REF="346"/>
the king's presence, and received their par∣dons;
and the king addressing himself to lord
John, said, <Q REND="inline">"My lord, I never did see you
before, and must confess that you have
been wronged. You was a faithful servant
to my mother, and hardly used when I un∣derstood
not the state of things as I now
do."</Q> Lord John was soon thereafter made
governor of Dunbarton castle, and admitted
of the privy council.</P>
<P>When the king went to Norway to bring
home his queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 27 &amp; 28, ad annum 1588.</NOTE> he deputed lord John to pre∣serve
the peace of the borders, and appointed
him one of the regency, till his return.</P>
<P>The king's favour for him still increasing,
he was pleased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacKenzie's heraldry.</NOTE> in regard of his great suffer∣ings,
and long and faithful services, to dignify
him with the title of marquis of Hamilton, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1599.</P>
<P>The king afterwards visited him osten at
his palace of Hamilton, and he continued to
enjoy a large share of his majesty's esteem
and favour as long as he lived.</P>
<P>He married Margaret Lyon, daughter of
John lord Glammis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Ha∣milton.</NOTE> ancestor of the earl of
Strathmore, widow of Gilbert earl of Cassilis,
by whom he had one son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI>—and one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John lord
Maxwell, ancestor of the earl of Nithsdale.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1604, and was succeded by
his only son,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, second marquis of Hamilton,
born <HI>anno</HI> 1589, who succeeded also to his
uncle James, earl of Arran, and duke of Chat∣telherault,
<HI>anno</HI> 1609, as before observed.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the gentlemen of
the king's bed-chamber, and one of the lords
of his privy council, before he arrived at the
age of twenty-one.</P>
<P>The king also, in consideration of his fa∣ther's
fidelity and sufferings for queen Mary,
erected into a temporal lordship the abbay∣lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
with the patronages and tythes of the
monastery of Arbroath, in favours of the mar∣quis,
by his royal charter dated <HI>anno</HI> 1608,
which was a great accession to his estate.</P>
<P>He was afterwards made steward of the
king's houshold, and, as another great instance
of his majesty's favour, he was created a peer
of England, by the titles of lord Innerdale,
and earl of Cambridge, <HI>anno</HI> 1619, the ho∣nours
being limited to the heirs-male of his
body.</P>
<P>He was appointed lord high commissioner
to the parliament 1621, when the five ar∣ticles
of the assembly of Perth were ratified;
and having managed matters in these ticklish
times with great prudence and dexterity, he
dissolved the parliament 27th August there∣after,
and was installed at Windsor one of the
knights of the most noble order of the gar∣ter,
7th July 1623.</P>
<P>He married lady Anne Cunninghame daugh∣ter
of James earl of Glencairn, by whom he
had three sons, and three daughters.</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1625, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, third marquis of Hamilton,
and second earl of Cambridge, born in 1606.
He was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet's me∣moirs of the family of Ha∣milton.</NOTE> by king Charles I. appointed a mem∣ber
of his privy council in both kingdoms;
and was also made one of the gentlemen of

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1630, he had the honour to repre∣sent
the king of Bohemia, and stood god-fa∣ther
to king Charles II.</P>
<P>The same year, by the king's direction,
he entered into treaty with Gustavus Adol∣phus,
of Sweden, to raise 6000 men for the
service of that prince, to be employed against
the Imperialists, for the recovery of the Pa∣latinate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
with which force he sailed from
Yarmouth the following year, having just be∣fore
his departure been elected and installed
knight of the most noble order of the gar∣ter.</P>
<P>In 1638, he was sent by the king into
Scotland, to endeavour to appease the com∣motions
beginning there, and was made his
majesty's high commissioner to the general as∣sembly
of the kirk; but they were then be∣come
so very untractable, that, according to
his instructions, he was obliged to dissolve
them. The next year he had the command
of the fleet that was sent to try to bring the
covenanters to reason, the king having ad∣vanced
as far as Berwick, with about six
thousand land forces; and by the marquis's
mediation, a treaty was set on foot, and a pa∣cification
ensued.</P>
<P>But as the behaviour and conduct of this
great man, during the whole course of the
civil war, is recorded by many able histori∣ans,
we shall say little more of it here; but
for his good and faithful services to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
he was created duke of Hamilton, marquis of
Clydsdale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by patent, in which all the
<PB N="334" REF="347"/>
titles of the family are narrated, <Q REND="inline">"to him and
the heirs-male of his body; which failing,
to the heirs-male of his brother, the earl of
Lanark, his body; which failing, to the eldest
heir-female of his own body without divisi∣on,
and the heirs-male of her body, they bear∣ing
the name and arms of Hamilton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> which
failing, to the heirs whatsoever of the said
James's body, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q> dated 12th
April, <HI>anno</HI> 1643.</P>
<P>We shall here add also the speech he made
to the Scotch parliament, against delivering
up the king to the English, which was in
these words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Will Scotland now quit her possession
and interest in her sovereign, and do it to
those whose emnity to him and us doth vi∣sibly
appear?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and Scots com∣pend. p. 61.</NOTE> Is this the consequence of all
your protestations of duty and affection to
his majesty? Is this the keeping of your
covenant, wherein you have sworn to de∣fend
the king's majesty, person, and au∣thority?
Is this a suitable return for the
king's goodness, both in consenting to all
your desires in 1641, and in his late trust∣ing
his person with you What censures
will the world pass upon this action? What
a stain will it be to the whole reformed re∣ligion?
and what danger may we not ap∣prehend,
both to the king's person, and to
Scotland, from the party that now prevails
in England?"</Q></P>
<P>However, all he could do or say did not
prevail; the king was delivered up to the
English, the fatal consequence of which we
need not repeat.</P>
<P>The duke, who did every thing in his
power to wipe off that everlasting stain upon
the Scotch nation, at the parliament 1648,
prevailed so far, that it was agreed to raise an
army in defence, and for the relief of the
king, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which the duke of Hamilton
got the command. He marched directly in∣to
England, was attacked by the parliament's
forces, near Preston, where his army was to∣tally
deseated, and himself taken prisoner.</P>
<P>After several months confinement, he was
brought to a trial before that infamous high
court of justice, where he received sentence
of death, and was accordingly beheaded in
Palace-yard, Westminster, on 9th March
1649, a few weeks after one of the best of
kings had suffered the same sate.</P>
<P>He died with undaunted courage, and re∣markable
tranquillity and composure of mind,
declared his steady and firm attachment to the
protestant religion, and prayed for the re∣storation
of the royal family, the moment be∣sore
he laid his head upon the block.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Fielding, daughter
of William earl of Denbigh, by Susanna his
wife, sister to George Villiers, the great duke
of Buckinghame, and by her had three sons,
and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. Charles.</P>
<P>2. James.</P>
<P>3. William.</P>
<P>All the above sons died young.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Mary,</HI> died young.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who became dutchess of
Hamilton, of whom more afterwards.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Susanna,</HI> married to John earl of
Cassilis.</P>
<P>The duke was succceded in his estate and
honours by his brother,</P>
<P>XIII. WILLIAM, second duke of Hamilton,
and third earl of Cambridge, born 14th De∣cember
1616, who was a man of great ac∣complishments,
honour, and integrity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. Careli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> and was
soon distinguished by king Charles I. by whom
he was highly esteemed, and raised to the ho∣nour
of the peerage, when he was a young
man, by the titles of earl of Lanark, lord Ma∣chanshire
and Polmont, by letters patent dat∣ed
31st March 1639.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the earl of Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. penes ducem de Hamilton.</NOTE> he
was appointed secretary of state for Scotland,
<HI>anno</HI> 1640, and was made knight of the most
noble order of the garter.</P>
<P>We shall not trouble our readers with an
account of his noble conduct during the civil
war, it being fully set forth in the histories
of these times; we shall only add, that after
the murder of the king, he raised a troop of
horse at his own charge for the service of
king Charles II. in order to his restoration,
with which he marched to the fatal battle of
Worcester, fought valiantly upon their head,
on 3d September 1651, and received a wound
in his leg, of which he died in eight days
thereafter, and was buried in the cathedral
of Worcester.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this great man's charac∣ter,
with the earl of Clarendon's words, who
will not be suspected of partiality in his fa∣vours.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was a man not inferior in partsor un∣derstanding
to the wisest men in the nati∣on,
of great honour, courage, and sincerity
in his nature, and, (which was a rare vir∣tue
in the men of that time,) was still the
same man he pretended to be; and, in truth,
was, in all respects, a very accomplished
person, of an excellent judgment, and rea∣dy
expression; and though he had been
been driven into some unwarrantable acti∣ons,
he made it evident, that he had not
been led by any inclination of his own,
and heartily run into all opportunies of re∣deeming

it; and in the very article of his
death, he exprest a great chearfulness, that
he had the honour to lose his life in the
king's service, and thereby to wipe out the
memory of his former transgressions, which
he always professed were odious to him∣self."</Q></P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Maxwell, daugh∣ter
and co-heiress of James earl of Dirleton,
by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who died an infant,—and four
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to Robert earl of
Southesk, and had issue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married, 1st, to James
lord Kilmaurs, eldest son of William earl of
Glencairn; and, 2dly, to sir David Cunning∣hame
of Robertland.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married, 1st, to Alexander
earl of Calendar; 2dly, to sir James Living∣ston
of Westquarter; and, 3dly, to James
earl of Finlater.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William
Blair of that ilk, an antient baron in the shire
of Air, and had issue.</P>
<P>Upon the death of duke William, without
surviving male-issue, the estates and titles de∣scending
by several patents to the heirs gene∣ral,
he was succeeded by his niece lady Anne,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XIV. Lady ANNE HAMILTON, eldest
daughter of James first duke of Hamilton,
the undoubted heir of line of the family, and
now dutchess of Hamilton, married William
Douglas earl of Selkirk, eldest son of Willi∣am
marquis of Douglas, by his second wife
lady Mary Gordon, daughter of George mar∣quis
of Huntly; in consequence of which
marriage, upon a petition from the dutchess,
he was created duke of Hamilton for life,
with all the titles, dignities, and precedency
belonging to the family, which appears by the
diploma,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in archivis Ca∣roli II.</NOTE> <HI>Willielmi ducis de Hamilton, mar∣chionis

Selkirk, domini Acon, Machanshire, et Daer,
&amp;c.</HI> dated 12th October 1660.</P>
<P>He was soon thereafter made one of the
privy council, and knight of the most noble
order of the garter.</P>
<P>Upon king James VII.'s accession to the
crown, he was made a lord of the treasury,
an extraordinary lord of session, and a privy
councillor for both kingdoms, in which office
he continued all king James's reign.</P>
<P>When the prince of Orange came over to
England, he was chosen, by divers Scotch no∣bility
and gentry then in London, to be their
president, when they addressed that prince to
take upon him the administration of all affairs,
civil and military, and was also chosen presi∣dent
of the convention of estates, who de∣clared
the crown vacant, and settled it on that
prince.</P>
<P>After he was crowned king, the duke was
appointed president of the council, one of the
extraordinary lords of session, and lord high
admiral of Scotland.</P>
<P>By said lady Anne dutchess of Hamilton he
left issue seven sons, and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Arran.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>William,</HI> who died in France
without issue.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of Selkirk.</P>
<P>4. <HI>John,</HI> earl of Ruglen.</P>
<P>5. <HI>George,</HI> earl of Orkney.</P>
<P>6. Lord <HI>Basil,</HI> who married Mary, daugh∣ter
and sole heiress of sir David Dunhar of
Baldoon, Bart. and was grandfather of Dun∣bar,
now earl of Selkirk.</P>
<P>7. Lord <HI>Archibald,</HI> who was appointed go∣vernor
of Jamaica by queen Anne, was a flag-officer
in the navy, and governor of Green∣wich
hospital. He married lady Jane Ha∣milton,
daughter of James earl of Abercorn,
and had issue two sons.</P>
<P>The duke's 1st daughter, lady <HI>Catharine,</HI>
married to John duke of Athole.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Susanna,</HI> married, 1st, to John
earl of Dundonald; and, 2dly, to Charles
marquis of Tweeddale.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to James earl
of Panmure.</P>
<P>And dying <HI>anno</HI> 1694, was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. JAMES, fourth duke of Hamilton, in
his father's lifetime designed earl of Arran,
was born 11th April 1658, had a noble and
liberal education suitable to his high birth and
quality.</P>
<P>Upon his return from his travels, he was
particularly distinguished by king Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Eng∣land, vol. III.</NOTE>
and was made one of the gentlemen of his bed∣chamber,
<HI>anno</HI> 1679, and was sent ambassador
extraordinary to the court of France, 1683.</P>
<P>When king James VII. succeeded to the
crown, he was made master of the wardrobe,
knight of the thistle, and colonel of the royal
regiment of horse.</P>
<P>He was steady in the interest of that un∣fortunate
prince, and never left him till he
embarked for France, 23d December 1688,
and was always suspected of retaining a warm
affection to him, even when the revolution
had altered the system of government, and
directed the subjects allegiance to a new king;
which plainly appears from the speech he made
in the beginning of 1689, when the prince
of Orange asked the opinion of the Scotch
<PB N="336" REF="349"/>
nobility and gentry then at London, in rela∣tion
to the affairs in Scotland. Upon this oc∣casion
the earl of Arran delivered his opinion
as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I have all the honour and deference for
the prince of Orange imaginable. I think
him a brave prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscellaneous collections of the year 1689. Crawfurd's peerage, p. 215.</NOTE> and that we owe him
great obligations, in contributing so much
to our delivery from popery: but while I
pay those praises, I cannot violate my duty
to my master. I must distinguish between
his popery and his person; I dislike the
one, but have sworn and do owe allegiance
to the other, which makes it impossible
for me to assign away that which I cannot
forbear believing is the king my master's
right; for his present absence from us in
France can no more affect my duty, than
his longer absence from us has done before;
and the prince desiring our advice, mine is,
that we should move his majesty to re∣turn,
and call a free parliament, for the se∣curing
our religion and property, which,
in my humble opinion, will at last be found
the best way to heal all our breaches."</Q></P>
<P>After king William was established in the
throne, the earl of Arran was twice sent pri∣soner
to the tower, on suspicion of correspond∣ing
with king James; but was never prose∣cuted;
however, he lived a retired life the
greatest part of king William's reign.</P>
<P>His father, being created duke only for
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem deHa∣milton, et Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> as before noticed, the hereditary honours
of the family still remained in the dutchess,
and did not descend to the earl of Arran their
son upon his father's death; wherefore the
dutchess made a surrender of her titles into the
king's hands, upon which a patent past, creat∣ing
him duke of Hamilton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the pre∣cedency
of his grand-father's patent in 1643,
as if he had succeeded thereto by his father's
death. This patent is dated at Loo, 10th
August 1698.</P>
<P>He opposed the union of the two crowns,
and, at the invasion 1708, was, by order of
council, taken into the custody of a messenger,
upon suspicion of his being privy to that ex∣pedition;
but he was soon admitted to bail,
the duke of Newcastle, earl of Wharton, and
lord Halifax being his sureties; and that same
year he was elected one of the sixteen peers
for Scotland to the British parliament.</P>
<P>In 1710, he was created a peer of Great-Britain,
by the titles of duke of Brandon, and
baron Dutton in England, by patent; the pre∣amble
whereof, (which is very honourable
for the family,) is to be found in the Scots
compendium, page 65; but in December the
same year his English peerage was disputed in
the British parliament, and was found to be
inconsistent with the articles of union, and
was therefore at that time set aside.</P>
<P>In 1712, he was constituted master of the
ordnance, and knight of the most noble order
of the garter as well as the thistle, the queen
having declared she would wear both orders
herself; and immediately thereafter, upon the
conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht, he was
appointed her majesty's ambassador extraordi∣nary
to the court of France; but a little be∣fore
he was to have set out for that kingdom,
he fought a duel with lord Mohun, wherein
they were both killed, on 15th November
1712.</P>
<P>Had not the duke been a man of uncom∣mon
bravery, he might well have refused the
challenge, being a privy councillor, and her
majesty's ambassador extraordinary; but that
he thought was inconsistent with his honour:
and some suspected he was killed unfairly by
general MacCartney, lord Mohun's second,
who, after king George's accession to the
crown, stood his trial, and was acquitted.</P>
<P>His grace's mother, Anne, the dutchess
dowager, survived him four years, and died
<HI>anno</HI> 1716, aged eighty.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Anne Spencer, daugh∣ter
of Robert earl of Sunderland, by whom
he had two daughters, that died young.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Elizabeth, daughter and
sole heiress of Digby, lord Gerard of Bromly,
by Elizabeth his wife, daughter to Charles
earl of Macclesfield, by whom he had issue
three sons, and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> marquis of Clydsdale, after∣wards
duke of Hamilton.</P>
<P>2. Lord <HI>William,</HI> who married Anne,
daughter and heiress of Francis Hawes, Esq;
but died without issue.</P>

the queen was his god-mother. He married

of the thistle, and installed at the abbay of Ho∣lyroodhouse,
<HI>anno</HI> 1726.</P>

of the bedchamber to king George I. and so

<P>THOUGH the sirname of this noble fa∣mily

an origin as that of Home, being a branch of
the great and illustrious house of Dunbar, earls

of Patrick, fifth earl of Dunbar, who had
been formerly married to—Courtenay.
By her he got the lands and barony of Home,
which had been given to her by her father up∣on
her marriage. This is clearly instructed
<PB N="342" REF="355"/>
by a charter upon a donation made by the

<P>From the lands and castle of Home this
William took his sirname, the family of March
having assumed the sirname of Dunbar a few
years before. He also carried the armorial
bearings of the earls of Dunbar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I.</NOTE> which his
posterity, the family of Home, have continu∣ed
to do ever since, with little variation; all
which is fully documented afterwards.</P>
<P>Here we have taken the liberty to differ
from former authors, who have deduced the
descent of the family of Home from <HI>Williel∣mus,
filius comitis Patricii,</HI> which is certainly
a mistake; for that William married Christi∣ana,
daughter and heiress of Walter de Cor∣bet
of Mackerston, by whom he had two sons,
Nicholaus and Patricius de Corbet; and nei∣ther
he nor his posterity ever took the name
of Home; all which is well vouched, and
more fully set forth under the title of Dunbar
earl of March, and sufficiently prove, that <HI>Wil∣lielmus,
filius comitis Patricii,</HI> could not be
progenitor of the family of Home.</P>

was a man of good parts, great honour, and a

his interest; and as he made a great figure in
that transaction, we shall give you his charac∣ter
from a cotemporary author, who writes a
full account of that affair: <Q REND="inline">"He was master

no temptation could seduce him in the least
from prosecuting and adhering, with the ut∣most
vigour, to what he owned to be his
principle and opinion; and was so zealous
for the interest of his country, that would
he have deserted her, he might more than
once have made his own terms with the

<HEAD>HOPE Earl of HOPETON.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Hope is of great antiqui∣ty
in Scotland.</P>
<P>John de Hope flourished in the reign of
king Alexander III. and was afterwards forced
to swear fealty to king Edward I. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lections, vol. III. p. 659.</NOTE>
when he over-run Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>Another John de Hope is mentioned in
Rymer's <HI>soedera Angliae,</HI> and got a protection
from king Henry IV. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VIII. p. 399.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1405.</P>
<P>Thomas de Hope got a charter from king
James III. of some lands lying near Leith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> in
January 1488.</P>
<P>There are many others of the sirname of
Hope to be sound in the publick records, but
as we cannot connect them with this noble
family, we proceed to deduce their descent
by good authority from,</P>
<P>1. JOHN de HOPE, who is said to have
come from France in the retinue of princess
Magdalene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nishet's ap∣pend. p. 97</NOTE> queen to king James V.</P>
<P>He settled in Scotland, having married Bet∣ty
Cummin, (but of what family we know
not) by whom he had a son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. EDWARD HOPE, who was one of the
most considerable inhabitants of the city of E∣dinburgh,
in the reign of queen Mary, and be∣ing
a great promoter of the reformation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calderwood's church hist. M. S.</NOTE> was
chosen one of the commissioners for that me∣tropolis
to the general assembly, <HI>anno</HI> 1560.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>III. HENRY HOPE, who, having applied
himself to the business of commerce, did great
<PB N="349" REF="362"/>
service to his country, and acquired a conside∣rable
estate to himself in the mercantile way.</P>
<P>He went often to Holland, where he carri∣ed
on a very advantageous trade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, Scots compend. and Nisbet's ap∣pend.</NOTE> and then
married Jacque de Tott, a French lady, whom
he brought with him to Scotland, and by her
had a son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir THOMAS HOPE, designed of Crai∣giehall,
a man of great parts and learning, who,
being bred to the law, became so eminent in
that profession, that even when a young man,
he was pitched upon to plead the cause of the
presbyterian ministers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calderwood's church hist.</NOTE> who were indicted for
denying the king's authority in matters eccle∣siastical,
<HI>anno</HI> 1606.</P>
<P>He acquitted himself so much to the satis∣faction
of the clergy, that he was ever after ad∣vised
in all their councils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop of Dunkeld's memoirs.</NOTE> and was the oracle
of their party.</P>
<P>He got charters, under the great seal, <HI>magistro
Thomae Hope advocato,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>et Johanni Hope, ejus filio,
terrarum dominicalium de Edmonstoun, baroniae de

<P>Also charters of the lands of Kinninmonth,
Ladeddys easter and wester, the lands of Ar∣nydie,
the lands of Kinkell, with the office of bai∣lliary
of the provostry of Kirkhaugh, the church
lands of Ceres, with the whole lands and ba∣ronies
of Craigiehall, Grantham, and many o∣thers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
too numerous to be here inserted, <HI>inter</HI>
1616 <HI>et</HI> 1624.</P>
<P>In the end of the reign of king James VI.
he was appointed joint king's advocate with
sir William Oliphant, who dying soon there∣after,
he was made sole advocate by king
Charles I. <HI>anno</HI> 1627,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE> and created knight and
baronet by the same Prince.</P>
<P>He got a new charter of confirmation from
king Charles I. <HI>domino Thomae Hope,</HI> of all the
above named lands and baronies; also char∣ters
of many others, together with all mines,
minerals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> coals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon his whole estates,
<HI>inter</HI> 1627 <HI>et</HI> 1642.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he attached himself entirely to the parliament's
side, and was by them appointed a privy coun∣cillor,
and advocate for life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1641, also
planter of kirks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But it seems the king did not suspect him
of disloyalty, for he appointed him high com∣missioner
to the general assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bp. Guthrie's memoirs.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1643,
then an office of high trust and estimation;
and to which dignity no commoner hath at∣tained
since.</P>
<P>In 1635, he was made one of the commis∣sioners
of exchequer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reseinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> He died in the end of
the year 1646, and left considerable estates to
all his sons, three of whom being lords of the
session, while their father sir Thomas was king's
advocate, it was thought indecent that he
should plead uncovered before them; which
was the origin of the privilege the king's ad∣vocates
have ever since enjoyed, of pleading
with their hats on if they please.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas was a man of very great abili∣ties,
and his works extant are still highly e∣steemed,
and sufficiently show his extensive
knowledge of our laws.</P>
<P>By Elizabeth, his wife, daughter of John
Bennet of Wallingford, Esq; he lest issue four
sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John Hope</HI> of Craigiehall, who suc∣ceded
him, and carried on the line of that fa∣mily,
which is now represented by sir John

<P>V. Sir JAMES HOPE of Hopeton, fourth
son of sir Thomas Hope of Craigiehall, was a
man of good parts, and being bred to the law,
was likeways a great proficient in that study.
He was also a good alchymist, and the first
who brought the art of mining to any degree
of perfection in Scotland.</P>
<P>He was made governor of the mint,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haddington's collections.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>

<P>He dying without issue, the estate and ho∣nours,

devolved upon the said master of Newbottle:
and as these titles are now in the marquis of
Lothian's family, we must refer our readers to
title Ker marquis of Lothian, where the suc∣cession
is deduced from the first of that most
noble house, to the present generation; we
shall only add what is said on this peerage by
our lords of session, in their report to the

<Q><P>"William master of Newbottle succeeded

his father, the marquis of Lothian, also sat

his father's decease, he succeeded to
the honours of Lothian. Therefore, if a
judgment were to be formed on what thus
appears, it would be natural to conclude,
that the honours of Jedburgh and Lothian

it appears, that the present marquis of Lo∣thian,

I. SOMERLED, thane of Argyle, (the im∣mediate
ancestor of this noble family) flou∣rished
in the reign of king David I. who suc∣ceeded
to the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1124,
and died in 1153.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged by all our historians,
that this Somerled was a man of great power
and interest. He married the daughter and
heiress of Olaus, one of the kings of the Ae∣budae,
whereupon he and his posterity, for se∣veral
generations, assumed to themselves the
title of kings of the Isles.</P>
<P>Somerled being no less ambitious than great,
raised an army, and invaded the territories of
Malcom IV. who succeeded David, was join∣ed
by Donald, son of Malcolm MacBeth, who
had been at the head of a formidable rebellion
in the preceeding reign; but king Malcolm
sent the brave Gilchrist, earl of Angus, against
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 248.</NOTE> who defeated them, took Donald pri∣soner,
and obliged Somerled to fly to Ireland,
<HI>anno</HI> 1157.</P>
<P>Somerled afterwards returned, raised a new
army, made a descent at a bay in the river
Clyde, and penetrated into the country as far
as Renfrew, where he was met and attacked
by the king's army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chronicle of Melrose.</NOTE> under the command of
Walter high steward of Scotland, was entirely
routed, and himself stain, <HI>anno</HI> 1164.</P>
<P>He had issue four sons.</P>

which appears from a ratification by the king of
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IV. p. 711.</NOTE> of an indenture entered into betwixt
Edward Baliol king of Scotland, and John
lord of the Isles, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1335.</P>
<P>That same year he got a charter from king
Edward, as he is then called, of the lands of
Kintyre, Knapdale, the islands of Mull, Skye,
Lewis, and a great many others, for which he
obliged himself, by all means possible, to mo∣lest
and annoy the enemies of Edward, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He afterwards got a safe conduct to go up
to England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 831.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1337; and it seems he
then set up for an independent prince;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. V.</NOTE> for as
such king Edward of England entered into a
league, offensive and defensive, with John
lord of the Isles, <HI>anno</HI> 1353.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter he was again recon∣ciled
to his lawful sovereign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. VI.</NOTE> offered himself
one of the hostages for king David's ran∣som,
<HI>anno</HI> 1357, and appears to have continu∣ed
a dutiful subject all his life afterwards.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist of the royal family, p. 57.</NOTE> second
daughter of king Robert II. and is then de∣signed
lord of Isla and Isles.</P>
<P>By her he had three sons, and two daugh∣ters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Donald,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John de Yle,</HI> ancestor of the MacDo∣nalds
of Dunveg and Glens, of whom the earls
of Antrim in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family.</NOTE> the MacDonalds of Lar∣gy

<P>He got a charter under the great seal from

<P>He got likeways a third charter of the
lands of Lochaber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and a fourth of the lands
of Kintyre and Knapdale, both of the same
tenor and date with the charter last-mention∣ed.</P>
<P>This John had other two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Godfridus,</HI> who, in a treaty with the
<PB N="360" REF="375"/>
king of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VII.</NOTE> is designed <HI>filius Johannis
del Yle, &amp;c. anno</HI> 1388; but we know no∣thing
of his posterity.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Reginald,</HI> who got from his father a
considerable estate, confirmed to him by a
charter under the great seal in these words:
<HI>Robertus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. Rob. II.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c. sciatis nos approbasse, confirmas∣se

<P>This Reginald was progenitor of the Mac∣Donalds
of Moydart, Clanronald, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of whom
Glengary, Moror, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are descended; but
whether he was a son of a former marriage,
or older or younger than John's successor, we
shall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>But as the different branches of the clan
MacDonald do not agree about this part of
their history, we shall only make an obvious
remark or two upon the preceeding charters,
and leave the determination of the points in
dispute to the judgment of our readers.</P>
<P>John of the Isles got his first charter, under
the great seal, of all the lands therein menti∣oned,
<Q REND="inline">"to himself and his heirs-general, hold∣ing
of the king,"</Q> before narrated, 1372.</P>
<P>About ten months thereafter, he gave a
considerable estate to his son Reginald, and
the heirs-male of his body, confirmed and ap∣proved
by the king, not holding of the crown,
but of John himself, and his heirs, whereby
John's lawful successor became Reginald's su∣perior;
and in the charter Reginald is neither
designed <HI>filius legitimus,</HI> nor <HI>dilectus filius,</HI> (the
common stile in old charters,) but simply <HI>fili∣us
meus:</HI> therefore, by any thing that appears
upon record, John's lawful heir was a diffe∣rent
person from Reginald.</P>
<P>John died in the end of 1387, or beginning
of 1388, and was insallibly succeeded in all
the estates he died possessed of, and in the su∣periority
of the other lands he had given off
to his children, by his son,</P>
<P>VIII. DONALD lord of the isles, who, it
seems, set out upon an independent sooting; for
Richard king of England entered into a trea∣ty
with him as a sovereign prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VII.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1388,
and his father John is then said to be <HI>nuper
defunitus.</HI></P>
<P>This Donald was a man of an aspiring ge∣nius,
and had vast possessions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> he gave off
parts of his lands to his friends and neighbours,
<HI>viz.</HI> the MacLeans, MacIntoshes, MacKenzies,
MacKinnons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all holding of himself for
military service, which greatly encreased his
power; but, upon the forfeiture of this fami∣ly,
these clans got their lands holding of the
crown.</P>
<P>In the year 1400, Donald, lord of the isles,
and John de Isle his brother, got a safe con∣duct
from king Henry IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. VIII. p. 146.</NOTE> to come to Eng∣land
with one hundred horse in their retinue,
to treat of a peace with the English, for them∣selves
and their friends.</P>
<P>The king of England afterwards gave pow∣er
to his commissioners to treat of a final peace
with them in their own country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 418.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1405.</P>
<P>In a truce concluded betwixt the king of
England and France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. IX.</NOTE> Donald, lord of the Isles
and John Stanely of Man, are included as in∣dependent
princes, <HI>anno</HI> 1414.</P>
<P>They are again both included in a treaty
with France as allies of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. XII. p. 400.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1416;
whereby it appears, that this lord was more
in the English interest than the Scotch.</P>
<P>He married dame Margaret Lesly, only
daughter of Walter Lesly, by lady Eupheme,
eldest daughter and co-heiress of William, the
last male of the antient earls of Ross, and up∣on
whose heirs the estate and honours of
Ross were settled by act of parliament. By
her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>As the battle of Harlaw happened in con∣sequence
of this marriage, we shall briefly ac∣count
for it as follows:</P>
<P>Walter Lesly, who married Eupheme,
countess of Ross, (besides his daughter, mar∣ried
to the lord of the isles,) had a son Alex∣ander,
who became earl of Ross, as heir to his
mother: He married Isabel, daughter of Ro∣bert
duke of Albany, governor of Scotland,
by whom he had an only daughter, Eupheme,
countess of Ross, his sole heiress: she became
a nun, and died without issue, whereby the
successi on to the earldom of Ross, in right
of blood, ought to have devolved upon the
said dame Margaret Lesly, lady of the Isles,
her undoubted heir of line.</P>
<P>But the duke of Albany having obtained
from his grand-child, Eupheme the nun, a re∣signation
of her honours in favours of his se∣cond
son the earl of Buchan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resign. penes comitem de Rothes.</NOTE> and failing heirs∣male
of his body, to fall to the crown, the
earl of Buchan thereupon added that of Ross
to his other titles.</P>
<P>Donald lord of the Isles claimed that earl∣dom
in right of his wife; the duke of Albany
determined his son should have it, in virtue of
the nun's resignation.</P>
<P>Donald being denied what he thought he
had a just title to, resolved to assert his right
by force of arms, and raised an army of about
<PB N="361" REF="376"/>
ten thousand men, chiefly of his own friends
and followers, the clans before-mentioned.</P>
<P>The duke was not behind-hand with him
in raising forces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 414.</NOTE> but soon got together an ar∣my
much about the same number, command∣ed
by the brave Alexander Stewart, earl of
Mar.</P>
<P>They met near a village called Harlaw,
within ten miles of Aberdeen, where a most
bloody battle ensued, fought with incredible
obstinacy on both sides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in which many brave
men lost their lives; but neither had reason
to brag much of the victory. The lord of
the isles, rather wearied than conquered, re∣treated
the next day, and the earl of Mar was
not in a condition to pursue him. This hap∣pened
<HI>anno</HI> 1411.</P>
<P>It seems Donald afterwards made up mat∣ters
with the governor; for the earl of Buchan
possessed the earldom of Ross without further
disturbance, till he was slain at the battle of
Vernoil in France, <HI>anno</HI> 1424; then that earl∣dom
came to the crown, in virtue of the re∣signation
by Eupheme the nun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> before-menti∣oned.
This is fully instructed by many char∣ters
under the great seal, to be seen in our
public records, though it does not appear
that the said dame Margaret, lady of the Isles,
ever gave up her title;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II.</NOTE> for she always de∣signed
herself countess of Ross, even after the
crown was in possession of that earldom.</P>
<P>Donald died in France, <HI>anno</HI> 1427, and was
succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>IX. ALEXANDER afterwards earl of Ross,
of whom Buchanan says, he was <HI>unus post regem
longe potenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>simus, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In his mother's lifetime he designed him∣self
<HI>dominus insularum et magister comitatus
Rossiae;</HI> for it seems he still intended to assert
his title to that earldom. He raised an army
of above ten thousand men, burnt the town
of Inverness, and laid waste a great part of
the country. The king, being highly incen∣sed
at this insolence, raised an army to oppose
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 489.</NOTE> and came up with him in Lochaber.
The clan Chatton, and the Camerons, seeing
the standard of their lawful sovereign, desert∣ed
the lord of the Isles, whose forces, being
immediately attacked by the king's troops,
were soon routed and put to slight, in the
year 1429.</P>
<P>Sometime thereafter, Alexander, repenting
of his disloyal practices, threw himself at the
king's feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 490.</NOTE> and implored mercy; who, not∣withstanding
his open rebellion, was graci∣ously pleased to pardon him.</P>
<P>At last king James, out of his great good∣ness
and love of justice, yielded the earldom
of Ross to him, being sensible he had a good
title to it in right of his mother, who was re∣ally
heir of line of the family, as before ob∣served,
by which accession to his estate he be∣came
one of the greatest and most powerful
subjects in the kingdom.</P>
<P>This Alexander, earl of Ross, grants a char∣ter
to John Ross of Kilravock in liferent, and
his son Hugh his apparent heir in fee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> of the
lands of Kilravock, Easter-Geddes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon
Kilravock's resignation to the earl, as his law∣ful
superior, 22d June 1440, confirmed by a
charter under the great seal.</P>
<P>In the minority of king James II. he was,
by the estates of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> appointed ju∣sticiar
of Scotland, benorth the river Forth;
and it is acknowledged he kept all that coun∣try
in peace and good order as long as he liv∣ed.</P>
<P>He granted several charters and other deeds
as earl of Ross, and lord of the Isles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> all con∣firmed
by charters under the great seal, which
is a sufficient proof, that the crown acquieseed
in his possession of that earldom.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Gordon.</NOTE> daughter of sir A∣lexander
Seton, lord of Gordon, and sister of
Alexander, first earl of Huntly, by whom he
had three sons, and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugh,</HI> progenitor of the MacDonalds
of Slate, as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Celestine,</HI> ancestor of lord MacDonald.
<HI>Vide</HI> title lord MacDonald.</P>
<P>1st daughter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the family of Su∣therland.</NOTE> <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John
earl of Sutherland, and was mother of Eliza∣beth,
heiress of that noble family.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Florence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> married to Duncan MacIntosh,
captain of the clan Chatton.</P>
<P>This earl died in the end of 1448, or be∣ginning
of 1449, and was succeeded by his
eldest son,</P>
<P>X. JOHN, earl of Ross, and lord of the
Isles, who was certainly one of the greatest
and most powerful men in the kingdom, and
behaved like a dutiful and loyal subject, ex∣cepting
his engagement with the earl of Dou∣glas,
as long as king James II. lived, with
whom he appeared to be in great favour.</P>
<P>There was a truce concluded with the En∣glish
in November 1449,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 254, &amp;c.</NOTE> in which John earl
of Ross was one of the guarantees; and to an∣other
in 1451.</P>
<P>And though he was engaged in the earl of
Douglas's rebellion, yet it is certain he made
his peace with the king very soon thereafter;
for in the year 1457, he is one of the gua∣rantees
of a treaty with the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 397, and 434.</NOTE> and one
of the wardens of the marches; and again in
1459.</P>
<P>But after the death of king James II. he be∣gun
<PB N="362" REF="377"/>
to revive the old pretensions of his fa∣mily
to independency; and, shaking off his al∣legiance
to his lawful sovereign, he entered
into a treaty with the king of England in the
following terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>"That John de Yle, earl of Ross, and lord
of the Isles, Donald Balagh, and John of
Yle, son and heir apparent of the said Do∣nald,
and all their subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The MacDo∣nalds of Moy∣dart or Clanronald.</NOTE> men, people, and
inhabitants of the earldom of Ross and Isles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> become liegemen and subjects to king
Edward IV. his heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to do homage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and that they shall remain for ever subjects
to the kings of England, and assist them a∣gainst
all their enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> King Edward,
on the other part, agrees, and gives the earl
of Ross, during life, a yearly pension of one
hundred merks sterling in time of peace,
and two hundred pounds sterling in time of
war; and twenty pounds sterling to Do∣nald
Balagh in time of peace, and forty
pounds sterling in time of war: and fur∣ther,
in case of a treaty for a final peace be∣twixt
the two kingdoms, that England shall
not agree with Scotland without getting the
earl of Ross,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 486.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> comprehended in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P></Q>
<P>This treaty was concluded 8th February
1462, but was kept secret for several years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and was never discovered till there was actu∣ally
a final peace concluded between Scotland
and England; by an article whereof it was
provided, that both the respective kings should
renounce all former engagements made against
each other; the English were thereby oblig∣ed
to produce their treaty with the earl of
Ross, by which this treasonable intrigue came
to light, <HI>anno</HI> 1474.</P>
<P>In the interim the earl of Ross got char∣ters
under the great seal from king James III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
of many lands and baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1468 <HI>et</HI>
1474.</P>
<P>At last John earl of Ross was summoned
before the parliament 1475, was indicted for
high treason, found guilty, and, by sentence
of the three estates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> was outlawed and forfeit∣ed,
and the earldom of Ross unalienably an∣nexed
to the crown by act of parliament.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter the earl submitted to the
king, who, out of his great elemency, restor∣ed
him to all the honours, lands, and islands
he possessed, as lord of the Isles, with the ap∣probation
of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"to him and the

<P>But notwithstanding the many acts of be∣nevolence
and favour conferred upon him by
king James III. we find him again relapsed in∣to
his former misdemeanors, and contracting
alliances with the enemies of his country.</P>
<P>He reassumed the titles of earl of Ross, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which appears by a correspondence betwixt
him and king Richard of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XII. p. 140.</NOTE> who sent
his commissioners <HI>ad tractandum cum dilectis

<P>His treasonable practices being fully made
known to the court, he was again outlawed
and forfeited, his estate, honours, and lord∣ship
of the Isles, annexed to the crown.</P>
<P>This second forfeiture is instructed by ma∣ny
charters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> under the great seal, <HI>inter</HI> 1490
<HI>et</HI> 1498.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of James

but dying without lawful issue, <HI>anno</HI>
1498, the representation of this great and no∣ble
family devolved upon the descendents of
his brother Hugh, of whom sir James Mac∣Donald
of that ilk is lineally descended: but
before we proceed to deduce his descent, we
must here observe, that this last John's two
natural sons,</P>
<P><HI>Angus,</HI> and</P>
<P>John,</P>
<P>Who, by the investiture of the lordship
of the Isles by parliament, in July 1476,
were both provided to the fee of the estate

John's body, as before observed, yet they
were both cut out by their father's last for∣feiture.</P>
<P>Angus, the eldest son, married lady Mar∣garet
Campbell, daughter of Colin earl of Ar∣gyle;
but dyed before his father without
lawful issue. He left a natural son, Donald,
who usurped the title of lord of the Isles, and,

<P>After the battle of Durham, in 1346, it
seems he had been guilty of some unwarrant∣able

<P>The earl of Douglas, having been long a

numerous, flourishing, and considerable family
that of Lochinvar then was.</P>

<P>In 1562, he made a resignation of his

legitimate in 1574.</P>
<P>Sir John dying in 1604, was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XVI. Sir ROBERT GORDON, formerly of
Glen, now of Lochinvar, who, in his young∣er
days, was one of the strongest and most
active men of his time.</P>
<P>He was one of the three defendants at the
famous tournament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Medulla hi∣stor. Scoti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Johnston's hist. p. 714.</NOTE> proclaimed by king James
VI. to whom his daughter, princess Elizabeth,
delivered the prizes, though her own brother
prince Henry, and several others of the first
rank, were challengers.</P>
<P>He also gave many remarkable instances of
his strength and courage, in defence of Gal∣loway
against the inhabitants of Annandale,
whose cattle, having been carried off by the
English, they were in use of making reprisals
on their next neighbours.</P>
<P>In one of those encounters, they having
killed James Gordon of Lochinkitt, his friend
and follower, he went down the country,
and burnt the houses of Gratney, Wamphrey,
Lockerby, Reidhall, Langrigs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and killed
Richard Irvine of Gratney, and took several
others of them prisoners, for which, and some
other daring actions of that kind, king James
sent out a strong party to apprehend him;
but he audaciously deforced the king's par∣ty,
laid violent hands on the officer who com∣manded
them, and made him eat and swallow
his majesty's warrant for apprehending him.</P>
<P>However, being at last weary of these law∣less
practices, his father and friends made in∣tercession
with the king, and obtained from
him an ample remission for all his former mis∣behaviour,
upon which he came to court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fam. de Ken∣mure.</NOTE> and
soon became so great a favourite of the king,
that he made him one of the gentlemen of his
bed-chamber.</P>
<P>After his accession to the crown of Eng∣land,
he bestowed upon him several lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
then in the crown by the annexation in 1587,

<P>And as a further testimony of his majesty's
favour, he got part of his lands erected into a
royal burrow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> with ample jurisdiction, to be
called the burgh of Galloway, now New-Galloway.</P>
<P>This sir John sold his barony of Stitchel,
which had been so long in the possession of
his family; and, it is said, gave the price of
it in a purse to the duke of Buckingham, in
hopes that he would favour his title to the
earldom of Gowrie, which he claimed in right
of his mother, eldest daughter of John the
last earl: but, this is said to have happened
the very night before the duke was stabbed
by Felton, and so had no effect.</P>
<P>He married lady Jean Campbell, daughter
of Archibald seventh earl of Argyle, by whom
he had a son and successor,</P>

<P>XVII. JOHN the eldest son succeeded to
the estate and honours of Kenmure, as above,
and was the third viscount Kenmure; but he
dying without issue, was succeeded by his bro∣ther,</P>
<P>XVII. ROBERT, fourth viscount Kenmure,
a man of great loyalty and integrity, who
suffered many hardships on account of his firm
attachment to the royal family. His estate
was forfeited by the parliament, and a reward
put upon his head by Oliver Cromwell, to a∣ny
who should bring him in dead or alive.</P>
<P>However, he survived the restoration, went
to court, and married one of the ladies of the
bedchamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. Hist. of the family of Kenmure.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1661. He returned to
Scotland immediately thereafter, and died at

<P>XVII. ALEXANDER GORDON of Penny∣game,
who was a great loyalist, but died about
1645, having contracted a great deal of debt
in the beginning of the civil commotions. This
appears by several apprisings and adjudications

<P>He died about the year 1300, and was

<P>That king Robert had a high esteem and

on the 9th of July 1439, by sir
Alexander Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> in revenge of lord Darn∣ly's
death, whom sir Thomas had killed some∣time
before.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>X. Sir ROBERT BOYD lord of Kilmarnock,
who was a man of great parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 313.</NOTE> and an emi∣nent
statesman. He was in high favour with
king James II. who created him a lord of par∣liament,
by the title of lord Boyd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 423.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1459,
and that same year he was one of the com∣missioners
appointed to treat of a peace with
the English, when a truce was concluded.</P>
<P>After the death of king James II. the lord
Boyd was appointed justiciar of Scotland, and
one of the lords of the regency, together
with the archbishops of St. Andrews and
Glasgow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> the bishop of Dunkeld, the earl of
Orkney, the lords Graham, Kennedy and E∣vandale,
who was chancellor; and it is ac∣knowledged
by all our historians, that the af∣fairs
of the nation were for several years ma∣naged
with great prudence, equity and justice.</P>
<P>The lord Boyd was twice sent one of the
ambassadors extraordinary to the court of Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 517, and 541.</NOTE>
in the years 1464 and 1465, and con∣ducted
his negociations with great dexterity,
honour and fidelity.</P>
<P>After the death of archbishop Kennedy,
the chief management of all public affairs de∣volved
upon the lord Boyd, who was a man
of fine address, and great authority and power.
His brother sir Alexander was employed to teach
the king the manly and military exercises, and
consequently much about his person: in short,
there was scarce any body could have access
to his Majesty, without the Boyds permission.
The king was still in the palace of Linlith∣gow,
where the lord Kennedy one of the re∣gents,
(and no friend of the Boyds,) kept a ve∣ry
watchful eye over him; the lord Boyd
therefore thought it necessary for his own in∣terest,
to have his majesty out of lord Ken∣nedy's
hands, which, by the blind of a hunt∣ing-match,
(no doubt with his majesty's ap∣probation)
he accomplished, and got him safe∣ly
conducted to Edinburgh, much against the
lord Kennedy's inclination, but where he was
afterwards entirely under the direction of the
Boyds.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="390"/>
However, lord Boyd, like a wife statesman,
prevailed with the king to call a parliament,
wherein it was declared, that the lord Boyd
had done the king and country good service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
in bringing his majesty from Linlithgow to E∣dinburgh,
and he was entirely acquitted there∣of;
this act of exoneration past 25th October
1466. And further, the lord Boyd was declar∣ed
governor to the young king and his brother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
<HI>ex consensu dominorum concilii nostri, &amp;c.</HI> which
was also ratified in parliament.</P>
<P>Upon the death of lord Livingston, he was
appointed great chamberlain of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by
a charter from the king, <HI>anno</HI> 1467.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great seal, of a
vast number of lands and baronies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Roberto
domino Boyd, gubernatori regni et regis, &amp;c.
inter</HI> 1466 <HI>et</HI> 1469.</P>
<P>And tho' this lord was certainly at the head
of all public affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Black acts of parliament.</NOTE> yet it appears he never
acted in any great matters of state, without
the advice and concurrence of those joined in
commission with him by parliament, such as
the king's marriage, his brother's, the duke
of Albany, earl of Mar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About this time the lord Boyd's eldest son,
who was certainly one of the most accom∣plished
young men in the kingdom, married
lady Mary Stewart, the king's eldest si∣ster,
with the consent and approbation of his
majesty. He got by her a great accession to
his estate, and was by king James III. cre∣ated
earl of Arran; this indeed greatly ag∣grandized
his family, and at the same time, was
one of the causes of its being so soon pulled
down and brought to ruin.</P>
<P>They became greatly envied by some, and
for their exorbitant power, and their having
engrossed the whole authority of the nation
to themselves, were as much hated by others.
And tho' there are no particular misdemean∣ors
or acts of oppression laid to their charge,
yet their enemies became innumerable.</P>
<P>The old lord was obliged to be much from
court, in the execution of his office of great
chamberlain; his son the earl of Arran was at
Denmark upon an embassy, and his lady with
him, who always accompanied him wherever
he went. The enemies of the family took
that opportunity of working their ruin. They
first got the king's favour and affection alie∣nated
from them; they then prevailed with
his majesty to call a parliament in 1469,
to which lord Boyd, his son the earl of Ar∣ran,
and his brother sir Alexander Boyd of
Duncow, were summoned to appear, and an∣swer
for such crimes as should be exhibited a∣gainst
them. The old lord being sensible of
the great authority and power of the faction
that was formed against him, and being also
shocked at the king's so suddenly withdraw∣ing
his countenance from him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> offic. of state.</NOTE> did not think
fit to appear and stand his trial, but retired
to England, and died at Alnwick the year
thereafter, <HI>anno</HI> 1470.</P>
<P>His son the earl of Arran was out of the
kingdom, so could not attend; but his bro∣ther
sir Alexander, trusting to his own inno∣cence,
appeared and stood his trial. The
chief crime of which they were all accused,
was their carrying off the king from Linlith∣gow
to Edinburgh, which was declared trea∣son;
and tho' they were all acquitted for that
crime,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> by act of parliament <HI>anno</HI> 1466, as be∣fore
observed, yet the torrent against them
was now become so violent, that the old lord
and his son were found guilty of treason, con∣demned
in absence, and all their estates and
honours were forfeited to the crown. Sir A∣lexander
who stood his trial, was found guil∣ty
art and part of carrying the king from
Linlithgow, condemned, and executed on the
Castle-hill, <HI>anno</HI> 1469. A remarkable in∣stance
of the instability of human grandeur.</P>
<P>Robert lord Boyd married Mariota, daugh∣ter
of sir Robert Maxwell of Calderwood, by
whom he had three sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Thom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> earl of Arran.</P>

fifth earl of Angus, lord high chancellor
of Scotland, and had issue.</P>
<P>XI. THOMAS, eldest son of Robert lord
Boyd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> created earl of Arran, as before ob∣served,
got charters under the great seal,
<HI>Thomae Boyd comiti Arramae et Mariae Stewart
ejus conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gi,</HI> of many lands and baronies, in
the years 1468 and 1469.</P>
<P>He was a man of fine parts and great ho∣nour,
was often employed in negociations of
state, which he always managed with great
fidelity. There is not the least stain upon
his character, transmitted to us by any histo∣rian,
except that of his being along with his
father, when the king was brought from
Linlithgow to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>The earl, upon the ruin of his family, re∣tired
with his lady to Denmark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> and afterwards
went into the service of the duke of Burgun∣dy;
where, for his brave and gallant behavi∣our,
he was highly esteemed, caressed, and
well supported by that prince, but he died
soon thereafter at Antwerp, <HI>anno</HI> 1471.</P>
<P>His lady then returned to Scotland, was
graciously received by her brother, and <HI>anno</HI>

<HEAD>KINNAIRD Lord KINNAIRD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS sirname is local, and was assumed
by the proprietors of the lands and ba∣rony
of Kinnaird in Perth-shire, as soon as sir∣names
began to be frequently used in this
country.</P>
<P>I. RADULPHUS, the immediate ancestor
of this noble family, flourished in the reign of
king William the Lion (who succeeded to the
crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165) and from the
colour of his hair was called Rufus.</P>
<P>He got a charter, from king William, of the
lands and barony of Kinnaird in Perth-shire,
<HI>Radulpho Rufo per suas rectas divisas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes dom. Kin∣naird.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to
which Matthew bishop of Aberdeen, Andrew
bishop of Caithness, William de Bosch chancel∣lor,
Philip de Colvile, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are witnesses.
The charter has no date; but must have been
granted in or before 1184, in which year
the bishop of Caithness died.</P>
<P>This Radulphus assumed his sirname from
his lands, and to him all the Kinnairds of
Scotch extraction owe their origin and de∣scent.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P><HI>Richard de Kinnaird,</HI>—and a daugh∣ter,</P>
<P><HI>Isabella,</HI> married to John of Invertuyl,
which appears from a charter of the lands of
Dunort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> granted by Richard de Kinnaird to

haill the lands of Dunort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in free marri∣age
with his sister Isabel, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Radulphus lived after the year 1200, and
was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>II. RICARDUS de KINNAIRD, who had
reserved to himself the superiority of the lands
of Dunort, though he gave the property to
John of Innertuyl with his sister, which shows,
that the family were proprietors of other lands
besides the barony of Kinnaird.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> This appears
by another charter of king William, which
must have been granted in or before 1214, in
which year that prince died.</P>
<P>He left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. RADULPHUS de KINNAIRD, who
granted a charter of confirmation to Richard
son of John of Innertuyl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of all and haill the
lands of Dunort, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Richard his fa∣ther
gave to John, son of Richard of Inner∣tuyl,
in free marriage with his sister Isabel∣la.
The witnesses to the confirmation were
Galsred bishop of Dunkeld, Alexander abbot
of Coupar, and William abbot of Scoon, which
must have been in or before 1249, in which
year the bishop of Dunkeld died.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>

where he spent some years under the tuition
of the learned Edmund Hay his uncle.</P>
<P>On his return home, being about twenty-four
years of age, he was brought into court

well qualified, by his improvements and con∣versing
with the muses, for any service his
master should honour him with. By which
introduction, and his fine accomplishments, he
so far engaged the king's favour, that he soon

<HEAD>MACLELLAN Lord KIRKCUDBRIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of MacLellan is of very
great antiquity in the south of Scotland.
They had vast possessions in lands, and were
very numerous and powerful.</P>
<P>David MacLellan is mentioned in a char∣ter
of king Alexander II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Murray.</NOTE> the third year of
his reign, which was <HI>anno dom.</HI> 1217.</P>
<P>All our historians agree, that the Mac∣Lellans
of Bombie were heretable sheriffs of
Galloway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> flourished with great lustre for ma∣ny
ages; and there were twelve knights of
that sirname in the south of Scotland at one
time, of which Bombie was the chief.</P>
<P>But as there are few of them mention∣ed
in our publick records, before the reign
of king James I. we shall from that aera be∣gin
to deduce their descent.</P>
<P>I. Sir PATRICK MACLELLAN of Bom∣bie,
lived about 350 Years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes dom. Gray.</NOTE> and married
a daughter of sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth,
ancestor of lord Gray, by whom he had a
son and heir,</P>
<P>II. Sir PATRICK MACLELLAN of Bom∣bie,
who flourished in the reigns of king
James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage,</NOTE> and II. and having been prevailed
upon to take part with lord Herries his rela∣tion
against the earl of Douglas, was besieged
in his own castle of Raeberry, and being at
last forced to surrender, was put to death <HI>an∣no</HI>
1452, leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI> of whom afterwards.</P>
<P>The clan MacLellan were so incensed at
their chief's being slain, that they all joined,
took up arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and committed vast depreda∣tions
upon the Douglases territories, in de∣fiance
of all law and justice, for which king
James outlawed and forseited them, and the
estate of Bombie was thereupon annexed to
the crown.</P>
<P>About this time the county of Galloway
was greatly infested with a company of rob∣bers
or gypsies from Ireland, whereupon the
king issued a proclamation, promising a con∣siderable
reward to any who would disperse
them, and bring in their captain dead or alive;
which was at last performed by the said sir
William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem. Mac∣Kenzie, Nis∣bet, &amp;c.</NOTE> son of the last sir Patrick of Bombie,
who, with the assistance of his friends, dispers∣ed
that lawless crew, killed their chiestain, and
brought his head upon the point of his sword
to his majesty; for which gallant behaviour
the king put him immediately in possession of
his barony of Bombie: and to perpetuate the
memory of that brave action, he took for his
crest, a Moor's head on the point of a sword,
with <HI>Think on</HI> for his motto.</P>
<P>III. Sir WILLIAM MACLELLAN now a∣gain
of Bombie, was ever after in great favour
both with king James II. and III.</P>

<P>IT is alledged by some antiquaries, that the

in the reign of king Kenneth II. about

<P>Others, with more probability, assert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduct. to Fordu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 60.</NOTE>
that they came originally from France.</P>
<P>Certain it is, some of that sirname came
from Normandy with William the conqueror,
<HI>anno</HI> 1066, had considerable commands in his
army, and afterwards settled in England.</P>
<P>'Tis also certain, that while king David I.
resided in England, he contracted a friendship
with several persons of Norman extract of the

that amiable prince, and settled here, of
whom some of the most considerable families
in Scotland are descended; and it is evident
from our histories and records, that the Mait∣lands
began to make a figure in this country,

<P>In 1558, he was constituted principal se∣cretary
of state to queen Mary; and in 1561
he was nominated one of her privy council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was many times afterwards sent as her
majesty's ambassador to the court of England,
where he had the management of affairs of
the utmost importance; and though his nego∣tiations
were sometimes not attended with the
desired success, yet he always acquitted him∣self
with fidelity and good conduct.</P>
<P>In 1561 he was sent ambassador to Eng∣land,
to desire queen Elizabeth's friendship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's histo∣ry, p. 181.</NOTE>
and to assure her majesty of queen Mary's sin∣cere
intention of cultivating a good under∣standing
with her dearest sister of England.</P>
<P>In 1562, queen Mary sent him to sollicit
an interview with queen Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotiswood'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hist. p. 185.</NOTE> and tho'
he used all the arguments that could be de∣vised
<PB N="394" REF="409"/>
by an able statesman, it could not be
brought about.</P>
<P>In 1563, he was sent to endeavour to get
queen Mary declared heir to the crown of Eng∣land;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's hist. p. 235, 236. and 237.</NOTE>
and certainly none had a better title;
but queen Elizabeth could never be prevail∣ed
on to yield that point.</P>
<P>In 1564, he was sent to treat about a match
for the queen of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, p. 396.</NOTE> and was at this
time most graciously received by queen Eli∣zabeth;
but that negotiation took no effect.</P>
<P>In 1565, he was at last sent to desire queen
Elizabeth's concurrence and approbation of
queen Mary's marriage with Henry lord Darn∣ly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith, An∣derson, Cambden, &amp;c.</NOTE>
but the queen of England likeways op∣posed
that, as she had done most of queen
Mary's other overtures,</P>
<P>When the civil war broke out in 1567,
his reputation for wisdom and integrity made
him greatly courted by both parties; but
what he had chiefly at heart was, the honour
and safety of the queen, and the interest and
good of his country. He strenuously opposed
every measure that was taken against her ma∣jesty,
both at home and at the court of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>He assisted sir William Kirkaldy in keeping
out the castle of Edinburgh against the young
king and the regent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. Jacobi VI.</NOTE> for which he was de∣prived
of the secretary's place, <HI>anno</HI> 1570.</P>
<P>He still continued steady in his loyalty to
the queen till his death, which happened in
1573,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> having married, 1st, Janet Menteith,
by whom he had no issue; 2dly, Mary,
daughter of Malcolm lord Fleming, by whom
he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI>—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Mary,</HI> married to Robert first earl of Rox∣burgh.</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, only son of sir William, el∣dest
son of sir Richard Maitland of Leithing∣ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. ad an∣num 1592.</NOTE>
married Agnes Maxwell; but dying
without issue, the estate and honours devolv∣ed
upon his uncle,</P>
<P>XII. Sir JOHN MAITLAND, second son
of the above sir Richard, a man of excellent
natural parts, which, by his father's care,
were highly improved by a liberal education.</P>
<P>He was a most faithful and loyal subject,
and a firm and steady friend to the interest of
queen Mary.</P>
<P>He first had the abbacy of Kelso in com∣mendam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta in ar∣chivis Mariae reginae.</NOTE>
which he afterwards exchanged with
Francis Stewart, the queen's nephew, for the
priory of Coldinghame, <HI>anno</HI> 1566.</P>
<P>In 1567, he was preferred to be lord pri∣vy
seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> upon his father's resignation, as be∣fore
observed.</P>
<P>But being inviolably attached to the queen's
interest, and entirely disapproving of the me∣thods
that were used to induce her majesty to
resign the government in favours of her in∣fant
son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament, ad annum 1570.</NOTE> he suffered many hardships, both in
his person and fortune; his benefice was taken
from him, and given to Alexander Home of
Manderston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and he was deprived of the of∣fice
of privy seal by act of parliament, which
was immediately bestowed upon George Bu∣chanan
the historian, <HI>anno</HI> 1570.</P>
<P>And being sensible that the regent, who

<P>As no subject had a greater share of his roy∣al

<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XIII. JOHN, second lord Thirlestane, a
man of great probity and honour, and was
likeways highly esteemed by king James VI.
who, in 1616, created him a viscount, and

Lauderdale, by letters patent, <Q REND="inline">"to him and

<P>He was appointed one of the senators of

<P>He married lady Isabel Seton, daughter of
Alexander earl of Dunfermline, lord high
chancellor of Scotland, by Lilias, daughter of
Patrick lord Drummond, by whom he had
three sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> afterwards duke of Lauderdale.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert,</HI> who married Margaret, daugh∣ter
and sole heiress of John Lundin of that
ilk, by whom he had one daughter, Sophia,
heiress of Lundin, married to John earl of
Melfort.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Charles,</HI> afterwards earl of Lauderdale,
who carried on the line of this family, of
whom hereafter.</P>
<P>And dying in 1645,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p. Guthry's memoirs.</NOTE> was succeeded by his
eldest son,</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN, second earl of Lauderdale, a
man of great abilities, and singular accomplish∣ments.</P>
<P>According to my lord Clarendon, he was
deeply engaged with the covenanters in the
beginning of the civil war, and, when a young
man, was one of the commissioners appointed
by the church of Scotland to meet with the
assembly of divines at Westminster, in 1643,
in order to new-model the government of the
church.</P>
<P>In 1644, he was one of the commissioners
from the estates of Scotland, to treat with
the king at Uxbridge; but that treaty taking
no effect, he was again commissioned by the
parliament to treat with his majesty at Hamp∣ton-Court,
<HI>anno</HI> 1647, the result whereof was,
the raising an army to rescue the king, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When the Scots were ready to march into
England, the earl was sent over to Holland,
to endeavour to prevail with the prince of
Wales to repair to the Scotch army; but it
could not possibly be accomplished at that
time. Before the earl got back to Scotland,
the bloody tragedy of his majesty's murder
was perpetrated, and the earl returned direct∣ly
to Holland, to offer his service to the prince
of Wales, now king Charles II. and was most
graciously received.</P>
<P>In 1650, the king came to Scotland, and
the earl accompanied him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's history, v. III. p. 286.</NOTE> but (according to
the noble historian) duke Hamilton and he
were obliged to conceal themselves amongst
their friends for some time after the king
landed, they being both very disagreeable to
Argyle and the covenanters, who ruled all
at that time.</P>
<P>After the parliament at Stirling in 1651,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 308.</NOTE>
all parties were (in appearance) heartily u∣nited
in the service of his majesty; and now
duke Hamilton and Lauderdale seemed to have
most of the king's confidence.</P>
<P>Lauderdale never after left his majesty, till
the fatal battle of Worcester, where he was
taken prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibident.</NOTE> sent to the tower of London,
underwent a severe confinement of nine years,
till he was released by the restoration of king
Charles II. <HI>anno</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>After which, in recompence of his suffer∣ings,
and on account of his great learning
and knowledge in the management of affairs
of state, he became the king's first favourite,
and prime minister.</P>
<P>He was made secretary of state, president
of the council, heretable high sheriff of the
county of Edinburgh, one of the extraordina∣ry
lords of session, first commissioner of the
treasury, one of the lords of his majesty's
bed-chamber, lord high commissioner to the
parliament, and governor of Edinburgh castle.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="411"/>
On second May 1672, he was created
marquis of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and duke of Lauderdale,
by patent to him and the heirs-male of his
body.</P>
<P>On third June thereafter, he was installed
at Windsor, a knight of the most noble order
of the garter.</P>
<P>On 25th June 1674, he was created a
peer of England, by the titles of baron Peter∣sham,
and earl of Guilford, by patent also to
the heirs-male of his body, and was made one
of the privy council for the kingdoms of Scot∣land,
England, and Ireland.</P>
<P>As this great man hath been most unjustly
aspersed by some historians, we shall take the
liberty to sum up his character in the words
of an author of good reputation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">North's exa∣mination of the history of the reign of king Charles II. p. 79.</NOTE> who, though
an Englishman, seems to have examined the
whole conduct of this Scotsman, without pre∣judice,
and says, <Q REND="inline">"It is well known, that,
by the prudent conduct of the duke of
Lauderdale, Scotland was in a posture not
only of safety, but of giving assistance to
the king, if needed.</Q></P>
<Q><P>He was an inexpugnable loyalist, and
keeped the door of Scotland close shut,
that no harm could get in or out there
while he was commissioner, which, in the
sense of the earl of Shaftsbury and his par∣ty,
was the worst of offences</P><P>In the mean time all the party foul∣mouths
vented against him the utmost
obloquy that could possibly be imagined,
as if he had been the basest of men, and
the modern time-serving historians chime
in with it, though most injurious to the
character and honour of the best and wisest
of statesmen that ever England had, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P></Q>
<P>John duke of Lauderdale married, 1st, la∣dy
Anne, daughter and co-heiress of Alexan∣der

had no succession.</P>
<P>And dying on the 24th of August 1682,

of the royal family, he followed the fortune

<HEAD>Old Earls of LENNOX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Irish antiquaries claim the honour
of the origin of this noble family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Kea∣tine, Peter Walsh, &amp;c.</NOTE> and
assert, that their first ancestor came from Ire∣land.</P>
<P>Some Scotch authors alledge, that they are
descended from Alexander, second son of Ken∣neth
thane of Lochaber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Simson's essays. Hist. of the Stew∣arts, &amp;c.</NOTE> and immediate young∣er
brother of Bancho, predecessor of the Scotch
royal family.</P>
<P>But the following narration will make it
plainly appear, that they came from Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Although upon the great victory obtained
by William duke of Normandy (afterwards
called the Conqueror) over Harold king of
England, at Hastings, in October 1066, all
the southern provinces of England submitted
quietly to the government of the victor; yet
several earls, great lords, and powerful ba∣rons,
in the northern provinces, much attach∣ed
to their old race of kings, and impatient
of servitude, stood up valiantly in defence of
their liberties, and the independency of their
country; and having carried on a bloody, but
unsuccessful, war against the Conqueror, whom
they looked upon as an usurper, were at last
compelled to leave their country, abandon
their estates, and save their lives by flying to
Scotland, where they were kindly received
by king Malcolm III. as will be shown here∣after.</P>
<P>The most eminent of these families was,
the ancestor of the Dunbars earls of March,
who are treated of under that title, page 437
of this work.</P>
<P>The next was the progenitor of the old
earls of Lennox, of whom we are now to
give an account.</P>
<P>The first of them we can fix upon, with
any certainty, is</P>
<P>1. AYKFRITH, or EGFRITH, an English
Saxon lord, who was possessed of a great e∣state
in Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi∣tali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> which, with Cum∣berland
and Westmorland, belonged to the
Scots for several generations: it is therefore
probable, that he was of Scotch extract. He
had also the lordships of Dent and Sadbergh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by du∣catus Loidien∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 71.</NOTE>
in York-shire, and was cotemporary with the
kings Canute and Edward the Confessor.</P>
<P>He made a great addition to his paternal
estate, by the marriage of Ecksrida, a rich
York-shire heiress,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doomsday book in regi∣stro honoris de Richmond.</NOTE> with whom he got vast
possessions, <HI>viz.</HI> the lands and baronies of
Askrig, Holteby, Marrig, Burgh, Ilkton, New∣ton,
Taulield, Wath, Melmorby, Normanby,
with several others, all in the same county.</P>
<P>He died about the year 1064, and left is∣sue
a son,</P>
<P>II. ARKYLL, or ARKILL, who succeeded
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and, in old records, is designed Arkill
chevalier, the son of Egfrith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was possessor not only of all the above
baronies in York-shire, but also of the lands
of Hakeford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> Hornebye, Layburn, Brumpton,
Carthorp, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the same county.</P>
<P>He had likeways a great estate in Nor∣thumberland,
which appears from a cotempo∣rary
author, who mentions him as one of the
most powerful men in that country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi∣talis, ad ann. 1068. Histor. Normann. scriptores, p. 511.</NOTE> accord∣ing
to these remarkable words: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Arkyllus
Nordankymbrorum potentissimus, cum rege
concordiam fecit, eique filium suum obsidem
tradidit, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>He married Sigrida, daughter to a power∣ful
baron in York-shire, <HI>viz. Kilvert filius Li∣gulfi,</HI>
by Ekfrida his wife, daughter of Aldu∣nus
bishop of Durham, by which it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simon Dun∣elmensis, p. 80.</NOTE>
that the celibacy of the clergy had not then
obtained in England. By her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Cospatrick,</HI> who marrying the daughter
of Dolphin, the son of Torphin, had a son,
Cospatrick, cotemporary with Simon of Dur∣ham;
a descendant of which Cospatrick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doomsday book, ap∣pendix, p. 61.</NOTE> by an
heir-female, was Adam de Steavolay, who
succeeded to his York-shire estate.</P>
<P>Arkyll being a great sticklet for the old
Saxon race, bore a principal share in all the
insurrections against William the Conqueror;
and being defeated by him, <HI>anno</HI> 1067, was
obliged to give his son Cospatrick an hostage
for his fidelity, who being too young to have
been concerned in his father's conspiracies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
got a good share of his York-shire estate.</P>
<P>Another dangerous insurrection having
been raised against the Conqueror, by the
Northern counties, in the year 1068, Arkyll
joined heartily in it; and being again defeat∣ed,
was forfeited, and obliged to leave Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordericus Vi∣talis, p 513. etSimon Dun∣elmensis, p. 82.</NOTE>
according to these words of the said
author, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Eodem tamen anno Arkyllus fuit in∣ter
rebelles Eboracenses; quibus profligatis,
a conquestore in exilium actus est, &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Arkyll fled to Scotland to king Malcolm
C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nmore, who having married Margaret, si∣ster
to Edgar Atheling, the true and lineal
heir of the English crown, received all the
Saxon exiles with open arms, gave them e∣states
in Scotland, and other rewards suitable
<PB N="399" REF="414"/>
to their birth, merit, and the losses they had
sustained in England, on account of their
loyalty</P>
<P>Arkyll obtained from that king a large
tract of land in the shires of Dunbarton and
Stirling, which was afterwards erected into
the earldom of Lennox, in favours of Alwin
Mac Arkyll his grand-son.</P>
<P>From this Arkyll his descendents, the old
earls of Lennox, are denominated by the Gae∣lic
bards and senachies, <HI>Siol Arkyll, i. e.</HI> the
posterity of Arkyll.</P>
<P>It is said he married a Scotch lady to his
second wife, by whom he had a son of his
own name, who succeeded him in his estate
in Scotland.</P>
<P>III. ARKYLL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartularies of Glasgow, Paisley, and Kelso.</NOTE> second of that name, in old
writs is always designed <HI>Arkyllus filius Arkyll,

<P>It does not appear that he survived his fa∣ther
long; and we have little of him on re∣cord,
only that he was father of</P>
<P>IV. ALWYN, according to the Saxon, or
Alwin according to the Celtic, who succeed∣ed
him, and is always designed MacArkill or

<P>We find him mentioned in our records in

most of that good prince's charters and dona∣tions
to the religious, which were very nu∣merous.</P>
<P>He was also witness to a general confirma∣tion
to the abbacy of Dunfermline, by king
Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dunfermline.</NOTE> who succeeded king David, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1153.</P>
<P>He was possessed of a vast estate, and be∣ing
also in great favour with the said king
Malcolm, was by that prince raised to the
dignity of earl of Lennox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Glasgow.</NOTE> in the beginning of
his reign.</P>
<P>He mortified to the church of Kilpatrick,
in the earldom of Lennox, the lands of Cock∣nach,
Edinvernan, Baccun, Finbealuch, Drum∣creve,
Craigintulloch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartularies of Paisley and Lennox.</NOTE> Monach, Kinnern, Drum∣glenan,

<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Alwin,</HI> his heir to the earldom of Len∣nox.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Ethus,</HI> or <HI>Eth,</HI> who is designed son to
the earl of Lennox, in a charter granted to
the monastery of Melross, by Duncan, the
son of Gilbert,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autogr. penes comitem de Morton; and chronicle of Melross.</NOTE> the son of Fergus, created af∣terwards
earl of Carrick, of the lands of
Maybothle-Beg, or Little Maybole, in Air∣shire,
in 1193; but we know nothing of his
posterity, unless Dovenald Lefitz, Michae
More de Levenax, mentioned in Prynne's
collections, <HI>anno</HI> 1296, is descended of him.</P>
<P>Though we cannot fix upon the precise
time of this earl's death, yet we are sure it
happened in the reign of king Malcolm, who
died <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>The earl was succeeded in his whole estates
and dignities in Scotland, by his eldest son,</P>
<P>V. ALUIN, second earl of Lennox, who
being very young at his father's death, king
William (who succeeded king Malcolm) as
superior of the earldom of Lennox, gave the
ward thereof, during earl Alwin's minority,
to his own brother, David earl of Hunting∣ton
and Garioch, which appears from an in∣quisition
taken by the abbot and convent of
Paisley, concerning the lands of Monach-Kenneran,
now supposed to be Balchonran,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley, p. 102.</NOTE>

the earldom of Lennox, according to

<P>Earl Alwin died about the year 1224, and
was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. MALDWIN, third earl of Lennox,

his brother Gilchrist is a witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autogr. penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1225;

<P>He confirmed all the donations made by

which he afterwards gave, with all its lands

also, the lands of Drumochar and Duntegle∣nan,

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is confirmed by king Alexander

<P>He gave also to the said abbacy the lands

<P>When the differences betwixt king Alex∣ander

Lennox was one of the guarantees on the
part of king Alexander,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 377.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1237.</P>
<P>He afterwards confirmed to the see of

by his predecessors to that abbacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and chartulary of Glasgow.</NOTE> to which
Malcolm his son and apparent heir was a wit∣ness,

<P>He made also considerable donations to
the religious at Arbroath, and several other
places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Arbroath, &amp;c.</NOTE> which is a sufficient proof of his great
piety, and the largeness of the estate he was
possessed of.</P>
<P>Nor was his loyalty and regard for his so∣vereign
less remarkable; so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, understanding
that king Alexander II. had a great inclinati∣on
to have into his own possession the castle
of Dunbarton, a place very strong both by
nature and art, and then the principal messu∣age
of the earldom of Lennox; also a large
extent of territory called Morach, with its
harbour and fishing contiguous thereto. The
earl immediately made a surrender of the whole
earldom into the king's hands, and thereup∣on
obtained a new charter, dated in 1238,
in which neither the castle nor territory were
contained, according to these remarkable
words in the charter:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox.</NOTE> <HI>quae</HI> (says the king)
<HI>ex consensu et bona voluntate ipsius Maldovini
comitis in manu nostra retinuimus, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The castle has ever since continued a royal

fort, and the town of Dunbarton was im∣mediately
erected by the king on the terri∣tory
of Morach.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Glasgow.</NOTE></P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of Walter,
son of Alan, hereditary lord high steward of
Scotland, ancestor of the royal family of Stew∣art,
by Beatrix his wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley, and history of the Stewarts.</NOTE> daughter of Gilchrist
earl of Angus. By her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Malcolm,</HI> lord of Lennox,—and a daugh∣ter,</P>
<P><HI>Ada,</HI> married to Malcolm Drummond, an∣cestor
of the great and ancient family of the
Drummonds earls of Perth.</P>
<P>The last mention we find made of this earl
in any public deed, is a general confirmation
granted by him to the monks of Paisley, dat∣ed
<HI>anno</HI> 1250, to which Walter Cumin earl
of Menteith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley.</NOTE> Gilchrist, Amelic, and Duncan,
the earl's brothers, are witnesses.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, in the beginning
of the reign of king Alexander III.</P>
<P>VII. MALCOLM, lord of Lennox, only son
and apparent heir of earl Maldwin, is menti∣oned
in many writs in the chartularies of Len∣nox

his father, <HI>anno</HI> 1248, leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>VIII. MALCOLM, second of that name,
who succeeding his grandfather earl Maldwin,
was fourth earl of Lennox.</P>
<P>King Alexander III. erected a large tract
of land of the earldom of Lennox into a free
forestry, with all the privileges and emolu∣ments
which any mortal could justly claim or
enjoy on account of any free forestry what∣ever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox.</NOTE>
in favours of this earl, dated at Kintore,

<P>He confirmed all the donations made by
his predecessors to the religious at Paisley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and chartulary of Paisley.</NOTE> in
1273.</P>
<P>He was a man of singular worth and me∣rit,
and a true lover of his country.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles that bound
themselves to stand by, and support the title
of, princess Margaret, daughter of the king of
Norway, to the crown of Scotland, failing
heirs-male of king Alexander III.'s body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 266.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>

<P>After king Alexander's death, he was one
of the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> who agreed to the
marriage of the king of Norway's daughter
(then queen Margaret) with Edward prince
of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>He confirmed the barony of Arrochar to
his cousin Duncan, the son of his grand-uncle
Gilchrist, ancestor of the laird of MacFarlane.
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was afterwards confirmed by a
charter under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> from king James
I. at a parliament held at Perth, <HI>anno</HI> 1430.</P>
<P>He died betwixt the years 1290 and 1292,
leaving issue only one son,</P>
<P>IX. MALCOLM, third of that name, who
succeeded him, and was fifth earl of Lennox.</P>
<P>We find him designed <HI>Malcolmus comes de
Lennox,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartularies of Lennox &amp; Paisley.</NOTE> <HI>filius et haeres quondam Malcolmi co∣mitis
de Lennox, anno</HI> 1292; and that same
year he was chosen one of the arbiters on the
part of Robert Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 644, ad ann. 1292.</NOTE> in his competition for
the crown with John Baliol; yet he, with
many others of the Scotch nobility, was for∣ced
to submit to, and acknowledge the supe∣rior
power of king Edward I. of England,
when he had over-run Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 644.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1294.</P>
<P>He was a worthy patriot, and firmly attach∣ed
to the interest of his country; for the liber∣ty
and independency whereof he fought all
his life, and was at last slain in defence of it.</P>
<P>In the year 1297,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walsingham, Matthew of Westminster, Hen. Knigh∣ton.</NOTE> he, in conjunction with
the earls of Buchan, Menteith, Strathearn,
Ross, Athole, and Marr, at the head of a Scotch
army, invaded, ravaged, and laid waste, all
the north of England.</P>
<P>As soon as Robert earl of Carrick (after∣wards
the valiant and victorious king Robert
Bruce) began to assert his just right to the
crown of Scotland, he was the first of the
nobility who joined him, was present with
him in most of his battles and distresses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 323 Bu∣chanan, &amp;c.</NOTE> and,
during all his life, adhered firmly to the best
of sovereigns in the worst of times.</P>
<P>He obtained from that great prince many
charters, under the great seal, of different
lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox.</NOTE> lordships, and baronies, and got from
him the hereditary <HI>sheriff-ship</HI> of the county
of Clackmannan, <HI>anno</HI> 1310.</P>
<P>The king also confirmed to him the she∣riff-ship
and lord lieutenancy of the earldom
of Lennox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which had been long enjoyed by
his predecessors.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles who
signed that famous letter to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> assert∣ing
the independency of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>He got also from that same prince a char∣ter
under the great seal, <HI>dilecto et fideli suo
Malcolmo comiti de Levenax,</HI> of the lands of
Lecky, lying near Buchanan, in recompence
of some lands in the territory of Cardross,
which the earl had yielded to the king. This

been near the end of king Robert's reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in Ro∣tul. Rob. I.</NOTE> <HI>an∣te</HI>

by Malcolm earl of Lennox, with all
his friends and followers. The two armies
came to an engagement, at a place called Ha∣lidonhill,
near Berwick; the Scots were ut∣terly
overthrown, and losta great number of
brave men, who all died fighting valiantly
in defence of their country, amongst whom
were the governor himself, the earls of Len∣nox,

<P>Into what family this heroic earl marri∣ed,
we cannot, with any degree of certainty,
affirm; but, if tradition can be credited, it
was to a sister or daughter of Donald earl of
Marr, and certain it is he had issue two sons,
who survived him.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Donald,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Murdoch,</HI> who obtained in patrimony,

of Lennox, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes dom. Napier.</NOTE> upon his death with∣out
succession, returned again to the family.</P>
<P>X. DONALD, sixth earl of Lennox, suc∣ceeded
his father in 1333, and was one of
the earls and great men of Scotland, who
granted commission to several plenipotentia∣ries
to treat with the English about the re∣demption
of king David II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 43.</NOTE> 26th September
1357.</P>
<P>He was also one of the <HI>magnates Scotiae,</HI>
who, in a parliament held at Scoon, 27th
March 1371, unanimously acknowledge and
declare, that John earl of Carrick (afterwards
king Robert III.) was eldest lawful son of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autogr. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
and undoubted heir and successor, to king Ro∣bert II.</P>
<P>To this famous deed earl Donald's seal was

it is lost; but the tag to which it was af∣fixed
still remains, with his name at it.</P>
<P>In the year 1372, king Robert II. gave to
his son Alexander, lord Badenoch, afterwards
earl of Buchan, the <HI>relevium</HI> or <HI>compositum</HI>
money, due to the king out of the estate of
Lennox at the entry of the next heir, to
which he succeeded upon this earl's death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul. Rob. II.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1373.</P>
<P>Earl Donald left issue only one daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Margaret,</HI> his sole heiress, of whom after∣wards.</P>
<P>He dying without sons, in him ended the
male-line of Maldwin, eldest son of Alwin
second earl of Lennox. The representation,
therefore, sell to Malcolm MacFarlane of Ar∣rochar,
the next heir-male, being grandson's
grandson of Gilchrist, fourth son of the said
second earl, of whom the present Walter
MacFarlane of that ilk is the lineal represen∣tative,
and is the only branch of that illustri∣ous
and once flourishing family, now subsist∣ing,
in a direct male-line.</P>
<P>XI. MARGARET, only child of earl Do∣nald,
succeeded to the estate of Lennox by
her father's destination, but not to the ho∣nours,
which he could not give, and neither
she nor her husband ever assumed them.</P>
<P>She married Walter of Faslane, son of A∣lan
of Faslane, the first of this family we find
upon record, who obtained the lands of Fa∣slane
from Malcolm fifth earl of Lennox; and
his son Donald the sixth and last of the old
earls of Lennox, gives a charter of confirma∣tion
to Walter of Faslane, the son of the said
Alan, of the lands of Faslane, Keppach, Cul∣grayn,
Kirkmichael, Glenfrone, Ballernock,
Letter-duald Moyleig, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> dated at Bellach,
<HI>in festo omnium sanctorum, anno</HI> 1351, where∣in
mention is made of the original donation
by earl Malcolm to Alan of Faslane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autogr. pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> MacFarlane.</NOTE> before
observed.</P>
<P>Though this family used no other sirname
but that of Faslane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duncan Stu∣art in the history of the royal family.</NOTE> yet a late author derives
their descent from Walter third lord high
steward of Scotland; and this seems to be in
some measure confirmed by a charter of Alan
of Faslane, to which his seal was appended,
having thereon a fess cheque of three tracts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dincaple.</NOTE>
with some other mark of distinction. But
be this as it will, it is certain that Walter of
Faslane, soon after his marriage with Marga∣ret
the heiress, relinquished his own paternal
coat, and assumed the armorial bearing of this
family, and his posterity took on the sirname
of Lennox, whereof the eldest son was to get
the estate of Lennox, which came by his mo∣ther,
and his second was to get his own pa∣ternal
estate of Faslane, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was at last designed <HI>dominus de Lennox,</HI>
which appears by a charter, <HI>Waltero de Fa∣slane,

de Lennox, &amp;c. anno</HI> 1384.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox p. 18.</NOTE> And in
November 1385, this Walter of Faslane in
person, and Margaret the heiress his wise, by
letters patent, resigned their right to the e∣state
of Lennox into the king's hands for new

<P>What became of these three brothers, or

were succeeded in the territory of Lennox

<P>XII. Sir DUNCAN LENNOX, knight, grand∣son
of Donald the sixth earl, and heir of line
of the family, who having the prospect of a
great estate, and Malcolm MacFarlane, ancest∣or
of the laird of MacFarlane, the undoubted
heir-male of the old earls, declining to accept
a dignity which he thought he had not estate
sufficient to support, king Robert II. out of a
grateful remembrance of the many and emi∣nent
services performed to the kings his pre∣decessors
by the family of Lennox, conferred,

heirs, the dignity of earl of Lennox, after it
had lain dormant for the space of eight or ten

said earl and his heirs, <HI>&amp;c. Item,</HI> it is agreed,
that the said earl of Lennox, or his heirs-male,
if he any has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Autogr. penes comitem de Panmure, et penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE> shall pay to the said sir Mur∣doch,

<P>The earl of Lennox, soon after the con∣summation

<P>He again renewed this entail, <HI>anno</HI> 1411,
to the same series of heirs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta pene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comitem de Panmure.</NOTE> whereby it is e∣vident
the heirs of line could never succeed
to the earldom of Lennox, while there were
any lawful heirs-male of the earl's body sub∣sisting.</P>
<P>Some time after king James I. returned
from England, Duncan earl of Lennox was
arrested at the king's instance, was incarce∣rate
in the castle of Edinburgh, and from
thence carried to the castle of Stirling, where
he was accused, not of treason, but of high
crimes and misdemeanors; of which, by the
verdict of an assize, he was found guilty, and
condemned to lose his head; which sentence
was executed upon him at Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordan, vol. II. p. 483.</NOTE> in May
1425, when he was about eighty years old.</P>
<P>That his estate was not forfeited, will af∣terwards
appear. He, with his son-in law
Murdoch duke of Albany, and his two grand∣sons
Walter and Alexander Stewarts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extract ex Chron. Sco∣tiae in biblio∣theca jurid. p. 272.</NOTE> who
suffered at the same time, were buried in the

three whereof were legitimated by
king James III. <HI>anno</HI> 1479.</P>
<P>After the entail in 1392, before narrated,
all the vassals of the earldom of Lennox
thought it absolutely necessary to have the
charters, granted by earl Duncan, confirmed
to them by his eldest daughter and undoubted
heiress Isabel; of this we have many instances
in the records, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> particularly a charter
granted to William lord Graham, ancestor to
the duke of Montrose, <HI>anno</HI> 1423, of the
lands of Errachy, Gartcarron, Strahblane,

<P>After her father's death, and the melancho∣ly
catastrophe of her family, which s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e long
survived, and bore with great equanimity,
firmness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromby.</NOTE> and resolution, she still continued to
possess the earldom of Lennox, and to grant
charters to the vassals; in some of which she

in one of the lands of Balgro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hyr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmum Lennox de Woodhead.</NOTE> held of

their titles.</P>
<P>XIII. ELIZABETH, second daughter of
Duncan earl of Lennox, was married to sir
John Stewart of Darnly, whose great actions
and death are inserted under the next title.
Their eldest son sir Alan Stewart of Darnly, fa∣ther
of John, afterwards lord Darnly and earl of
Lennox, obliges himself in his son John's con∣tract
of marriage with Margaret, daughter of
Alexander lord Montgomery, to infeft her in
a forty merk land of the lands of Dreghorn

<P>This John, on 16th December 1460, took
instruments upon his requiring Andrew lord
Evandale, chancellor of Scotland, to grant
him brieves furth of the chancellary, direct∣ed
to the sheriffs of Stirling and Dunbarton,
for serving him one of the heirs portioners of
the deceast Duncan earl of Lennox, father of
Elizabeth of Lennox, grand-mother to the
said John,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in all the lands in which the earl
died last seized and infeft, and is afterwards
actually served and retoured heir to him, in
the half of the lands of the said earldom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and
the principal messuage of the same, on 23d
July 1473; and of this John the earls and
dukes of Lennox are descended, as in the
next title, Stewart duke of Lennox.</P>
<P>XIII. MARGARET, third daughter of earl
Duncan (though by some authors said to be
second) was married to Robert Menteith of
Rusky,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> who insefts her in some of his lands,
25th July 1392. By her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Murdoch Menteith</HI> of Rusky, who married
Christian, daughter of sir David Murray of
Tullibardine, ancestor of the duke of Athole,
and had by her a son Patrick, who died with∣out
succession. Murdoch had also two daugh∣ters.
1. Agnes, married to sir John Haldane of

son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et pe∣nes Rob Hal∣dane de Glen∣eagles.</NOTE> John Haldane of Rusky, was, in the

She is served heir to her great-grand-father at
Dunbarton, 4<HI>to die Novembris</HI> 1473, before
this inquest, <HI>viz.</HI> Alexander Cunninghame of

<P>The above mentioned heirs portioners had
a long contest amongst themselves, concern∣ing
the division and succession to the earldom
of Lennox, which was at last determined in
favours of the family of D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly, <HI>anno</HI> 1477,
whereby that earldom came to the Stewarts;
and, in consequnence of the above descent, the
Stewarts of Darnly, and Haldanes of Glen∣eagles,
quarter the arms of Lennox with their
own; but the Napiers of Merchiston have e∣ver
since assumed the arms of Lennox, in
place of the old bearing of the Napiers.</P>
<P>By the preceeding narration it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet. vol. I. p. 139.</NOTE>
that the earldom of Lennox, according to the
above mentioned entail, went in a regular
course of succession to the lawful heirs of line
of that antient family, which is fully instruc∣ted
by the above indisputable documents; and
if earl Duncan had had a son lawfully born,
he would have had a just and undoubted right
to both the estate and title of earl of Lennox,
in which case the female succession could ne∣ver
have taken place.</P>
<P>Yet we must here observe, that the said
earl Duncan had a son Donald, who, in an
authentic charter of confirmation from the
countess of Lennox, of the lands of Balgro∣chyr,
is designed <HI>filius legitimus quondam Dun∣cani
comitis de Lennox, &amp;c.</HI> These lands of
Balgrochyr ly in the parish of Camsie, and
earldom of Lennox. The charter is granted
by sir William Graham of Kincardine, ance∣stor
of the duke of Montrose, in 1423, which
lands he held of the laird of Craigbernard,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he of the family of Lennox: therefore
Isabel, then designed dutchess of Albany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes Willielmum Lennox de Woodhead.</NOTE> and
countess of Lennox, as superior thereof, con∣firms
the same to the said Donald, <HI>anno</HI> 1444;

Esq; the Lennoxes of Calzie, Plump∣toun,

the line of this family, of whom afterwards.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Helen,</HI> married, 1st, to
William sixth earl of Errol; 2dly, to John
earl of Sutherland.</P>
<P>The earl of Lennox endeavouring to rescue
the king out of the earl of Angus's hands,
who, it is said, kept him little better than a
prisoner, was killed in the attempt near Lin∣lithgow-bridge
by his cousin sir James Hamil∣ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story, &amp;c.</NOTE>
son of the earl of Arran, after he had
been made prisoner by Pardowie, <HI>anno</HI> 1526.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>X. MATTHEW, fourth earl of Lennox,
who betook himself to a military life, and
served in the wars of France with great repu∣tation.</P>
<P>After the death of king James V. he re∣turned
to Scotland, and put several projects
on foot, which were thought inconsisent with
the honour and dignity of the nation; but
being disappointed in his expectations, he re∣tired
to England, was outlawed and forfeit∣ed.</P>
<P>He was kindly received by king Henry
VIII. who bestowed upon him in marriage
his niece lady Margaret Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi∣storians.</NOTE> daughter of
Archibald earl of Angus, by the queen of
Scotland, king Henry's sister, and gave him
with her an estate in England, according to
Mr. Crawfurd, worth 1700 merks sterling
<HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>The earl entered into a contract or treaty
with king Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XV. p. 19. 22. 29, &amp;c.</NOTE> whereby he bound himself
to deliver up to the king of England his ter∣ritory
of Dunbarton, the isle of Bute, the
castle of Rothsay, with several other lands
and lordships in Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1544, but it
never was performed.</P>
<P>He continued in England till he was re∣called
by queen Mary, <HI>anno</HI> 1563; and his
<PB N="402" REF="423"/>
forfeiture was then repealed by act of parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>His son Henry lord Darnly came to Scot∣land
soon after him, was married to queen
Mary, and declared king of Scotland. He
was afterwards most barbarously murdered,
and the earl of Lennox prosecuted those
suspected to have been concerned in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi∣storians.</NOTE>
particularly the earl of Bothwell, who was
tried by his peers, but was then acquitted.</P>
<P>After the death of the regent Murray, the
earl of Lennox was appointed regent of Scot∣land,
but was killed at Stirling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist. Crawford, &amp;c.</NOTE> having enjoy∣ed
that office only about thirteen months, <HI>an∣no</HI>

<P>By the said lady Margaret Douglas he had
issue several children, but they all died young,
except,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Henry,</HI> lord Darnly, who married queen
Mary, as before observed, and was father of
king James VI.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles.</HI></P>
<P>XI. This CHARLES succeeded his father,
and was fifth earl of Lennox.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth Cavendish, sister of
William first earl of Devonshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of England, vol. I. p. 304.</NOTE> by whom he
had only one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Arabella Stewart,</HI> married to Willi∣am
marquis of Hartford, but died without issue.</P>
<P>The earl dying also without other children,
<HI>anno</HI> 1576, the representation devolved upon
his uncle Robert, the bishop before mention∣ed,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>X. ROBERT, second son of John third
earl of Lennox,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's bi∣shops, p. 128.</NOTE> being born a younger bro∣ther,
was bred to the church, and was bishop
of Caithness. Upon the death of his nephew
Charles, he succeeded to the earldom of Len∣nox,
and was the sixth earl; but he then
having no children, made a resignation of the
earldom of Lennox in the king's hands, in fa∣vours
of his nephew Esme Stewart, lord d' Au∣bigny;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Stew∣art's hist. &amp;c.</NOTE>
on which account he was created
earl of March.</P>
<P>He turned protestant, and married lady E∣lizabeth
Stewart, daughter of John earl of
Athole, but dying without issue, the estate
and honours of Lennox devolved upon his ne∣phew
Esme, son of his brother John, before
mentioned, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>X. JOHN, lord d' Aubigny, third son of
John third earl of Lennox, was captain of the
Scotch gens d'arms in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the office. of state, p. 331.</NOTE> and governor
of Avignon in the reign of king Francis I.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>XI. ESME, lord d'Aubigny, upon whom
the earldom of Lennox devolved, as before
observed. He had his education in France,
came over to Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1579, and was
most kindly received by his majesty, who im∣mediately
gave him a grant of the lordship of
Arbroath; then in the crown by the forfeiture
of lord John Hamilton. He created,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the privy seal, ad annum 1580.</NOTE> or ra∣ther
confirmed the earldom of Lennox to
him, and the heirs-male of his body allenarly;
which failing, to return to the crown. He
then appointed him governor of the castle of
Dunbarton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the office. of state, Spotiswood's history, &amp;c.</NOTE> captain of the guards, first gentle∣man
of the bed-chamber; great chamberlain
of Scotland, and duke of Lennox, <HI>anno</HI> 1581.</P>
<P>This sudden rise to power and honours,
procured him envy, though he was a man
of a mild and sweet disposition, and a lover of
peace; but it being alledged that he was too
much attached to the Roman catholic religi∣on,
he was strangely persecuted by the re∣formers.
The king, who was convinced he
was not so, continued his firm friend, and was
like to be brought to trouble upon his ac∣count;
he therefore, much against his maje∣sty's
inclination, retired to France, and died
soon thereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> in May 1583. A staunch
protestant according to Mr. Crawford.</P>
<P>He married Catharine de Balsack, daugh∣ter

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. LUDOVICK, second duke of Lennox,
whom the king immediately brought from
France, took great care of his education, and
confirmed to him all the estates and honours
which belonged to his father.</P>
<P>He also bestowed upon him the lordship of
Methven and Balquhidder, and appointed him
heretable admiral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and lord high chamberlain

<P>He assisted at the queen's coronation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XVI. p. 60.</NOTE> 1590.</P>

<P>AS the rise and descent of the ancient

proceed directly to the immediate ancestor of
this branch of that noble family, being de∣scended
of the house of Balquhain, which, for
antiquity, yields to few of the name of Les∣ly
in Scotland.</P>
<P>WILLIAM LESLY, who flourished in the

<P>2. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>II. This GEORGE LESLY of Drummuir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the fam. of Lesly, M. S. penes Mr. David Rae advocate; and Mr. Mar∣tin's collecti∣ons.</NOTE>
progenitor of this noble family, married Ma∣ry,
daughter of—Stewart of Kilcowie,
by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>III. Captain GEORGE LESLY, a brave
soldier, who had the command of the garri∣son
in the castle of Blair, in the reign of king
James VI.</P>
<P>He married Anne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ib. and Craw∣furd's peer∣age.</NOTE> daughter of—Stew∣art
of Ballechin, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir ALEXANDER LESLY, who hav∣ing
a strong military genius, went abroad to
push his fortune in the foreign wars, where
he had the opportunity of signalizing his cou∣rage
and conduct so often,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Nis∣bet, vol. I. p. 97.</NOTE> that he justly ac∣quired
the reputation of a man of great know∣ledge
in the military art.</P>
<P>He first served a volunteer in lord Vere's
regiment in Holland, where he soon rose to
the degree of a captain.</P>
<P>He then went to Sweden, and entered in∣to
the service of Gustavus Adolphus, and per∣formed
such heroic actions under that great
monarch, that he raised him to the rank of a
lieutenant-general, then to that of velt mar∣shal
of his armies.</P>
<P>In 1628, when the town of Stralsund was
besieged by a victorious army, under the com∣mand
of Count Walsten, and reduced almost
to the last extremity, the king of Sweden sent
general Lesly to take upon him the command
of the garrison, where he behaved with such
singular resolution and conduct, that he obli∣ged
the Count to raise the siege. The
burghers were so sensible of the great service
he had done them, that they made him con∣siderable
presents, and struck several medals in
honour of him upon that occasion, some where∣of
are still preserved in the family.</P>
<P>In 1630, he drove the Imperialists intire∣ly
out of Rugen, and continued in the Swe∣dish
service with great glory and renown, till
the troubles broke out in his own country,
that he returned home.</P>
<P>He immediately laid out some of his mo∣ney
upon lands in the north country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and got
charters under the great seal, <HI>domino Alexandro
Lesly, militi, et Gustavo Lesly filio suo,</HI> of the
lands of Auchintoul, <HI>&amp;c. inter</HI> 1635 <HI>et</HI>
1637.</P>
<P>In 1638, he was invited by the covenan∣ters
to take upon him the command of their
army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me∣moirs.</NOTE> which he accepted of, and was made
governor of the castle of Edinburgh in March
1639.</P>
<P>In <HI>anno</HI> 1640, he invaded England upon
the head of the Scotch army, and defeated a
party of the king's troops, under the com∣mand
of lord Conway at Newburn, and took
possession of Newcastle.</P>
<P>His behaviour and conduct is approved by
parliament, and he got an order for 100,000
merks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament, and rescinded acts.</NOTE> to be paid out of the first and readiest
of the public money, for his good and faithful
services, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately thereafter, there was a treaty
set on soot with the king at Rippon, general
Leslie being one of the parliament's commis∣sioners,
at the conclusion of which the king
was so well pleased with the general's beha∣viour,
that he first created him lord Balgony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Leven.</NOTE>
then raised him to the dignity of earl of Le∣ven,
by patent to his heirs whatsomever,
<HI>anno</HI> 1641.</P>
<P>He got a charter under the great seal, <HI>A∣lexandro
Leslie domino de Balgony,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>militi, an∣no</HI>
1641; and afterwards got charters, <HI>Alex∣andro
comiti de Leven,</HI> of several lands and
baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1641 <HI>et</HI> 1643.</P>
<P>In 1642, he was sent over to Ireland with
some forces, to suppress an insurrection in
that country; and returning in 1643, had
again the command of the Scotch army that
was sent to the assistance of the parliament's
forces against the king; and the victory ob∣tained
over his majesty's forces at Marston∣muir,
<PB N="406" REF="427"/>
<HI>anno</HI> 1644, was chiefly ascribed to the
conduct of the earl of Leven.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the committee of
estates by the Scotch parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1645,
one of the supernumeraries of the com∣mittee,
<HI>anno</HI> 1646, and got a new commis∣sion
to be lord general, <HI>anno</HI> 1647.</P>
<P>He was one of the planters of kirks, and
had a considerable pension settled on him, be∣sides
1529l. <HI>per</HI> month for the payment of
his troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> including trumpeters, kettle drums,
<HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1649.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding what is above observed,
his after-behaviour would induce one to be∣lieve,
that his real principles were rather loy∣al
than otherways; and that, had he imagin∣ed
the parliament would have driven matters
to such extremities, he would not have been
so hearty in their interest; yet a reverend
author says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me∣moirs.</NOTE> that he was one of the peers that
sat in the parliament in January 1649, and
did nothing to hinder the king's murder.</P>
<P>However, none appeared more forward
than the earl of Leven afterwards for raising
an army, and restoring king Charles II.</P>
<P>He served as a volunteer against Oliver
Cromwell at the battle of Dunbar, and hear∣tily
joined and concurred with the loyalists
in every measure for re-establishing our old
constitution in church and state; but when
he, with others of the loyal party, had a
meeting in Angus, to concert matters for
their future conduct, general Monk, who

<HEAD>KER Marquis of LOTHIAN.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the noble and illustrious name of
Ker is of very great antiquity in Scot∣land,
appears from many authentic docu∣ments.</P>
<P>Some deduce them from a noble family of
that sirname in France, one whereof came o∣ver
to England with William the Conqueror,
had a considerable command in his army, and
afterwards settled in England; in confirmati∣on
of which they alledge, that baron Ker, and
several other families of that sirname, now
subsisting in France, trace their origin even
higher than that aera.</P>
<P>Others are of opinion, that Ker is a local
sirname, and was first assumed by the posses∣sors
of the lands and baronies of Ker and Kers∣hall,
in Lancashire, where several families of
that name have made a considerable figure for
many ages past: But it must be observed,
that the Kers in England and France have the
very same armorial bearings; so whether they
came from France to England, or from Eng∣land
<PB N="417" REF="438"/>
to France, we shall not pretend to deter∣mine.</P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie, that learned and
judicious antiquary, is of opinion, that the
Kers first settled in the south parts of Scot∣land
about the year 1330; but it is most cer∣tain
they were a numerous and flourishing fa∣mily
in this country long before that time;
for we find many of that sirname swearing
fealty to king Edward I. of England, betwixt
the years 1291 and 1297, for lands lying in
different parts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>Henricus Ker swore fealty in 1296.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect vol. III. p. 657.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nicol Ker ditto, Prynne, ibid. page 660.</P>
<P>Andrew del Ker—, ibid. page 661.</P>
<P>Willielmus Ker, who swore fealty for lands
in Air-shire, <HI>anno</HI> 1291,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on Ragman's roll, p. 29.</NOTE> and is said to be an∣cestor
of the Kers of Kersland.</P>
<P>Thomas Ker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 14.</NOTE> <HI>miles, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie mentions two bro∣thers
of that sirname, who settled in the south
parts of Scotland, <HI>viz.</HI> Ralph and Robert Kers;
but whether they came from England or
France, or were sons of any of the above∣named
Kers, he does not determine; but
thinks that Ralph, ancestor of the Kers of Fer∣nyhirst,
was the eldest brother, because that
family carried the same arms with the Kers
in England and France, without any difference
either of tincture or charge. We shall there∣fore
follow that great author, and deduce
their descent according to his account.</P>
<P>I. RALPH KER, who settled in Teviotdale
about the year 1330, got possession of the
lands lying betwixt the water of Jed and the
lands of Straseburgh, of which the earls of
Douglas were superiors.</P>
<P>He afterwards called the lands by the name
of Kers-haugh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MacKenzie's collect. in the lawiers library, Edin.</NOTE> which continued for some time

<P>King James VI. no sooner took the go∣vernment
upon himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the privy seal.</NOTE> than he gave sir Tho∣mas
liberty to return home, <HI>anno</HI> 1579; and

<P>He married Christian, daughter of sir A∣lexander
Hamilton of Innerwick, widow of
sir Patrick Home of Polwarth; but dying
without issue, in him ended the male-line of
the first and second sons of sir Andrew Ker of
Fernyhirst, No. IX of this account, whereby
the representation devolved upon the descend∣ant
of the third son, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Before we return to sir Andrew's third
son, it must be observed, that Robert, third
lord Jedburgh, finding that he had no issue,
made an entail of his estate and honours, with
consent of the crown, in consequence of the
above-mentioned patent, in favours of Willi∣am
lord Newbottle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mac Kenzie's collect. in the lawiers libra∣ry, et chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> son of Robert, then earl,
afterwards marquis of Lothian, his nearest
heir-male; and after him to the eldest son of
the house of Lothian for the time, as a di∣stinct
peerage for ever; by which entail and
confirmation it is provided, that albeit the el∣dest
son of that family bear the title of lord
Jedburgh, and thereby have the privilege of
a peer, yet it shall not prejudge him as to the
precedency due to the eldest son of the fami∣ly
of Lothian. This deed is dated 11th of
July 1670.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when William lord Newbottle
succeeded to Robert third lord Jedburgh, in
virtue of the above entail, he took his place
in parliament as lord Jedburgh; and the el∣dest
sons of the family of Lothian have since
that time exerted the same privilege of sitting
and voting in parliament, as well as their fa∣thers,
which appears from the parliament rolls

Charles I. a grant of the lands and lordship of

1634; by which the peerages of Lothian,
Ancrum and Jedburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> were now all in this
family.</P>
<P>Earl William was a man of great honour
and integrity; and though he was on the par∣liament's
side during the greatest part of king
Charles I. his troubles, yet he had the utmost
abhorrence of the barbarous treatment the king
met with from the parliament of England.</P>
<P>In 1648, he, with some others, were sent
commissioners from the estates of Scotland, to
treat with the English in behalf of the king;
and though Oliver Cromwell had, by that
time, expelled most of the members of both
houses of parliament, and was then perfectly
master of the rump, yet he remonstrated in the
name of the whole kingdom of Scotland, a∣gainst
the using any violence or indignity up∣on
the sacred person of the king: He added, that
the whole nation had the very thoughts thereof
in the utmost abhorrence and detestation, and
took a solemn protest against their proceed∣ings;
but all his honest endeavours proved
fruitless; upon which the earl transmitted to
the estates of Scotland an account of what he
had done, and his conduct was highly approv∣ed
of.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, the earl conti∣nued
steady in his loyalty to his son king Charles
II. and contributed all that was in his power
towards his restoration, and was one of the
commissioners appointed to treat with his ma∣jesty
at Breda, <HI>anno</HI> 1650.</P>

sons and seven daughters.</P>

<P>As the earl was a man of staunch presby∣terian
principles, he was deeply engaged with

most sincerely to bring about a paci∣fication,

king and them.</P>
<P>At last, when a peace was concluded, and
ratified in parliament in 1641, the king was
so sensible of the good intentions and friend∣ly
offices of the earl of Loudoun, that he con∣stituted
him lord high chancellor of Scotland
that same year.</P>

<P>THOSE of the sirname of Fraser yield
to none in Scotland for antiquity, and
all our historians agree, that they are of
French extraction.</P>
<P>In the M. S. history of the family, it is
said that one Julius de Berry, a French gentle∣man
of rank, who lived near Bourbon, made
a great entertainment at his house for the
king of France as he passed that way; that
amongst other delicacies, there were fine
strawberries, fully ripened before the ordina∣ry
time, wherewith the king was so well
pleased, that he assigned him strawberry leaves
for his arms, which in the French language
are called Frases or Frasiers; from which he
assumed Fraser for his sirname; and certain
it is, the Frasers continue to carry strawber∣ry
leaves, or frases, for their armorial bearing
to this day.</P>

is uncertain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Kenzie's ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tin's col∣lections, &amp;c.</NOTE> Some authors say, that a

<P>The Frasers were undoubtedly settled, and
had considerable possessions in lands in the

Malcolm Canmore, which is sufficiently in∣structed
by their donations to the religious.</P>
<P>Gilbert de Fraser is witness to the founda∣tion

by Cospatrick earl of Dunbar and March, in

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which last place was one of

<P>He is often in publick records designed sir

auditors of the debate in the competition for
the crown betwixt Bruce and Baliol, on 5th
June 1291;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 553, and 567.</NOTE> and on the 12th of the same
month, we find him, with many others of his
countrymen, swearing fealty to king Edward
I. of England.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, leaving issue two
sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> who carried on the line
of this family, as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir SIMON FRASER of Oliver-castle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
who is acknowledged by all Scotch historians
to have been one of the greatest heroes of his
time, and performed many great and glorious
actions, in defence of the liberties of his coun∣try.</P>
<P>He was lieutenant-general of the Scotch
forces when sir John Cummin of Badenach
was guardian of the kingdom; and it is well
known how these two, with scarce 10,000
Scots, defeated three English armies in one
day, each of them of equal, if not superior,
numbers to themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 552.</NOTE> near Roslin, <HI>anno</HI>

glory gained by the Scots on that day chief∣ly
to the remarkable courage and conduct of
sir Simon.</P>
<P>As it is inconsistent with the brevity of
this work, to enumerate all the glorious ac∣tions
of this great man, we shall only add,
that he was at last taken prisoner, and sent to
London, where king Edward most cruelly

daughters, the one married to the ancestor of
the marquis of Tweeddale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">MacKenzie, Nisbet, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the other to
the predecessor of the family of Wigton. In
consequence of which marriages, these two fa∣milies
have continued to quarter the arms of
Fraser with their own.</P>
<P>Sir Simon dying without male-issue, the
representation devolved upon his brother sir
Alexander before mentioned, to whom we
now return.</P>
<P>IV. Sir ALEXANDER FRASER, second son
of sir Simon of Oliver-castle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was also a
great patriot, and a man of singular valour
and intrepidity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 571.</NOTE> He joined king Robert Bruce
as soon as he began to assert his title to the
crown, and never deserted him in his greatest

<P>He was taken prisoner at the battle of
Methven, in endeavouring to rescue his royal
master, <HI>anno</HI> 1306, and did not obtain his li∣berty

several bodies of the English, retook sir Tho∣mas
Randolph the king's nephew, sir Alexan∣der
Fraser, and others, <HI>anno</HI> 1308.</P>
<P>King Robert being perfectly sensible of
the great merit of this sir Alexander, daily
heaped new favours upon him, he being mar∣ried
to his sister lady Mary Bruce.</P>
<P>He afterwards made him lord high cham∣berlain
of Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve of the officer of state.</NOTE> which high office he en∣joyed
as long as the king lived.</P>
<P>Sir Alexander, by the king's bounty, and
the lucrative offices he enjoyed, became pos∣sessed
of a vast estate in the North, consisting
of many lands and baronies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 274.</NOTE> too numerous to

<P>As he had been a faithful and steady friend

son king David, and at last lost his life in his
service at the battle of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI> 1332.</P>
<P>By the said lady Mary Bruce, daughter of
Robert earl of Carrick, he left issue five sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 276.</NOTE> his heir, who left issue only
one daughter, Margaret, married to sir Willi∣am
Keith, great marishal of Scotland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>His other four sons were <HI>Simon, William,
James,</HI> and <HI>Andrew.</HI> Which was the eldest
we shall not pretend to determine; but</P>
<P><HI>Simon</HI> carried on the line of this noble fa∣mily.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was ancestor of the Frasers, lords
Salton.</P>
<P><HI>James</HI> and <HI>Andrew</HI> were both killed at the
battle of Halidon-hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 311.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1333.</P>
<P>V. Sir SIMON FRASER, son of sir Alex∣ander,
great chamberlain of Scotland, seemed
to inherit the virtues of his worthy ancestors,
and embraced every opportunity of fighting
in defence of the liberties of his country, even
when a young man.</P>
<P>He became possessed of the barony of Lo∣vat,
whether from the king's bounty, or from
his father, we shall not determine, but the
king assigned him the three crowns for part of
his armorial bearing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 115.</NOTE> as being so nearly relat∣ed
to his family, which, by some, hath been
mistaken for the arms of the Bissets.</P>
<P>This sir Simon was also killed in the ser∣vice
of his country, at the battle of Halidon∣hill,

<HEAD>DUNBAR Earl of MARCH.</HEAD>
<P>This great and illustrious family is
undoubtedly sprung from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
kings of England, and the princes or earls of
Northumberland, which is sufficiently attested
by many eminent historians, and other au∣thentic
documents: we shall therefore de∣duce
their descent by unquestionable authori∣ty
from</P>
<P>I. CRINAN, a man of the first rank and
quality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hovedon's last of Eng∣land, Franc∣fort edit. page 424.</NOTE> and head of one of the greatest and
most opulent families in the north of Eng∣land,
who flourished about the end of the
tenth century, and was father of</P>
<P>II. MALDREDUS, who married Algatha,
daughter and heiress of Uthred prince of Nor∣thumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. of the kings of England, and Salmon's chronology, p. 6.</NOTE> and grand-child of Ethelred
king of England, who succeeded to the crown,
<HI>anno</HI> 979, and died <HI>anno</HI> 1016.</P>
<P>A good historian, who lived about this aera,
has these words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hovedon, p. 424.</NOTE> <HI>Hane Algathan later (U∣thredus)

<P>By her he had a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. COSPATRICIUS or GOSPATRICI∣US,
who was earl of Northumberland in right
of his mother.</P>
<P>When William the Conqueror had over-run
the greatest part of England, he allowed Cos∣patrick
to possess his earldom of Northumber∣land
for some time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> upon his paying him a
considerable sum of money; but, being after∣wards
jealous of his greatness and power, al∣ledged
he had been carrying on some private
correspondence with his enemies, the mal∣contents
of England; he therefore deprived
him of his titles and estates, and expelled him
the kingdom, <HI>anno</HI> 1071.<NOTE PLACE="marg">All our histo∣rians agree in this-, Also Simon Dunel∣mensis; char∣tulary of Cold∣stream, penes MacFarlane, p. 69, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Cospatrick sled to Scotland, and was kind∣ly
received by king Malcolm Cammore, who,
being a generous prince, bestowed upon him
the lands and manor of Dunbar, in East-Lo∣thian,
and several baronies in Berwick-shire.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="459"/>
His future conduct and behaviour showed,
that king Malcolm's favours were not mis∣placed;
for he served him faithfully, and con∣tributed
greatly to establish peace and order
in the kingdom.</P>
<P>And as the manor of Dunbar then be∣came
his chief seat, it was afterwards assumed
for the sirname of the family.</P>
<P>He left issue three sons, and one daughter.</P>

<P>IV. COSPATRICIUS succeeded his father,
and made a great figure in Scotland. He was
a brave warrior, often fought valiantly with
the Scots against the English, and was ap∣pointed
warden of the marches.</P>
<P>He is witness to many of our kings char∣ters,

<P>He appears to have been created earl soon
after this aera;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin. writs of Colding∣hame penes MacFarlane, p. 67.</NOTE> for he made a donation to

<P>This donation of the lands of Edram and

which day earl Cospatrick died.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 9.</NOTE> This is do∣cumented

<P><HI>Cospatrick,</HI>—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Philip de Montgo∣mery,
ancestor of the earl of Eglington.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>V. COSPATRICIUS, second earl, who,
like his father, was a strenuous defender of
the borders of Scotland.</P>
<P>He was a great benefactor to the religious,
and is witness to many of their charters and
donations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle, penes eund.</NOTE> particularly one by king David I.
to the abbacy of Newbottle, and is therein
designed <HI>Cospatricius comes filius Cospatricii,</HI>

<P>Also a donation to the church of St. Ni∣cholas
of Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of a carucate of land, to which
his three sons, Cospatrick, Edward, and Ed∣gar,
gave their consent, and are witnesses.</P>
<P>By the above donations, and several others
too numerous to be here inserted, it suffici∣ently
appears, that this family had vast pos∣sessions
in the shire of Berwick as early as the
reign of king David I. particularly the lands
and barony of Home, which afterwards be∣came
the property, sirname, and title of one
of the greatest and most noble branches of this
illustrious house, as has been shown under the
title earl of Home, page 341 of this work.</P>

<P>He was a brave soldier, was engaged in

<P>Here we beg leave to observe, that the a∣bove
William, third son of Patrick fifth earl
of Dunbar, is said, by former authors, to have
been ancestor of the family of Home, which
certainly is a mistake; for <HI>Willielmus filius

kept the sirname of Corbet, and were the
only sons that this William ever had.—All
which is attested by many documents, and suf∣ficiently
prove that <HI>Willielmus filius comitis

of Home.</P>
<P>This William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chronicle of Melrose.</NOTE> son of earl Patrick, died
<HI>anno</HI> 1253, and Christiana de Corbet, his

<P>Earl Patrick died <HI>anno</HI> 1232,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, v. II. p. 59, cui suc∣cessit Patricius filius ejus, et nepos regis.</NOTE> and was suc∣ceeded
by his son,</P>
<P>IX. PATRICK, second of that name, and
sixth earl, promiscuously designed of Dunbar
and March.</P>
<P>He was a man of fine parts, and in great
savour with king Alexander II. who often
employed him in negotiations of importance,
and he always acquitted himself with fidelity
and honour.</P>
<P>He, with Walter lord high steward of Scot∣land,
subdued that great and formidale rebel
Thomas Dow-MacAllan, and obliged him to
submit to the king's mercy, <HI>anno</HI> 1235.</P>
<P>He also reduced, and brought to a submis∣sion

Fraser, were guarantees for the king of
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1237.</P>
<P>He was also one of the guarantees in ano∣ther
treaty betwixt the kings of Scotland and
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 428.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1244.</P>
<P>He afterwards went to the holy war with
Lewis IX. of France, accompanied by Walter
lord high steward of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chronicle of Melrose.</NOTE> and David
Lindsay of Glenesk, but died at the siege of
Damieta in Egypt, <HI>anno</HI> 1249.</P>
<P>He left issue by Christian his wife, second
daughter of said Walter lord high steward of
Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story, p. 49.</NOTE> only one son,</P>
<P>X. PATRICK, seventh earl, who succeed∣ed
him, and was a man of great worth and
merit, and a true patriot.</P>
<P>When Walter Cummin earl of Menteith
fortified the castle of Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 90.</NOTE> and refused
to surrender it to the king, Patrick earl of
March reduced it, and obliged Walter to im∣plore

<P>King Alexander likeways employed him in

king of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 558, &amp; 566.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1255.</P>
<P>He married Cecilia, daughter of John de

<P>XI. PATRICK, eighth earl, who was high∣ly
esteemed by king Alexander III. to whom
he did many signal services.</P>
<P>He commanded the left wing of the royal
army at the memorable battle of Largis, where
the lord high steward commanded the right,
and the king the main body or center, and
obtained a glorious victory over Haco king
of Norway, who had invaded Scotland with a
great army, <HI>anno</HI> 1263.</P>
<P>The year thereafter, the earl of March,
with the lord high steward, reduced the Isle
of Man, with all the Ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udae or Western
Isles; and in 1266, Magnus king of Norway,
yielded all pretensions to those islands, for
4000 merks, and an annuity of 100 merks,
which brought about the marriage betwixt
Eric, son of Magnus, with princess Margaret,
daughter of king Alexander III.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1284, this earl was one of the <HI>mag∣nates
Scotiae</HI> that entered into a solemn engage∣ment,
acknowledging princess Margaret, daugh∣ter
to Eric king of Norway, to be true and
undoubted heir to the crown of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. II. p. 266, &amp; 284.</NOTE> and
to receive her as queen, upon the death of
king Alexander III. her grandfather.</P>
<P>He was also one of the Scotch nobles that
wrote to the king of England about the mar∣riage
of Margaret queen of Scotland with his
eldest son prince Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>After the death of the queen, he became
one of the competitors for the crown, as be∣ing
grandson of Ada,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 553.</NOTE> daughter of king Willi∣am
the Lion, but it seems he afterwards gave
up his pretensions; for in the competition be∣twixt
Bruce and Baliol, we find this earl of
March was one of the arbiters chosen on the
part of Bruce, <HI>anno</HI> 1292.</P>
<P>He died 1294, having married Christian
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story, p. 34.</NOTE> daughter of Robert lord of Annandale,
competitor for the crown of Scotland, by
whom he had a son and successor,</P>
<P>XII. PATRICK, ninth earl, who, like ma∣ny
of his brave countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. vol. III.</NOTE> was forced to
submit to the superior power of king Edward
of England, and swore fealty to him, <HI>anno</HI>
1296.</P>
<P>In 1304, the parliament of England chose
him one of the representatives for Scotland,
but the Scotch affairs beginning then to have a
more favourable aspect, he refused to serve in
such a parliament, though he had lands lying
both in Scotland and England.</P>
<P>Soon after Robert Bruce was king of Scot∣land,
we find him in the enemy's interest, his
strong castle of Dunbar in the hands of the
English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer. tom. III. p▪ 14.</NOTE> and himself appointed by king Ed∣ward
one of the keepers of the peace upon
the English borders, <HI>viz.</HI> Lancashire, Cum∣berland,
Westmorland, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1307; yet
he was afterwards reconciled, and in great
friendship with king Robert, and was one of
the <HI>magnates Scotiae</HI> that attended him to his
convention at Air, when the succession to the
crown was settled, to which he affixed his
seal, <HI>anno</HI> 1315.</P>
<P>He married Marian, daughter of Duncan,
tenth earl of Fife, by whom he had two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Patrick,</HI> tenth earl of March.</P>
<P>2. <HI>George,</HI> of whom it is said the Dunbars

<P>He died in the end of 1315, or beginning
of 1316, and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. PATRICK, sixth of that name, and
tenth earl, who was a man of great honour,
loyalty, and integrity, and always a firm friend
to the royal family.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles that sign∣ed
that famous letter to the Pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> asserting
the independency of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Thomas Randolph, re∣gent

<HI>anno</HI> 1342.</P>
<P>And was one of the chief commanders at

David, by being too forward, was taken pri∣soner;
but the earl of March, after the battle
was lost, made a glorious retreat, and by his
good conduct, saved a great part of the army.</P>
<P>This earl was afterwards employed in ma∣ny
embassies and negociations with the En∣glish,
to procure the king's liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> which at

continued a dutiful and loyal subject during all
the reign of king Robert II.</P>
<P>He was warden of the marches, and was
very successful in repressing the insolences of
the English borderers.</P>
<P>In 1380, he was one of the commissioners

which ended only in a truce.</P>
<P>In 1384, he joined the earl of Douglas,
and they burnt the town of Roxburgh, took
the castle of Lochmaben, defeated the En∣glish,
who had invaded the South borders, and
took a rich convoy that followed their army.</P>
<P>After all these services, he revolted to the
English; for which our historians give the
following reason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</P>
<P>The earl's daughter, lady Elizabeth Dun∣bar,
was contracted to David prince of Scot∣land,
the king's eldest son, and it is said the
earl had actually paid a considerable sum to
the king, in part of his daughter's portion.</P>
<P>The earl of Douglas being then the great∣est
man in the kingdom, proposed to the king
to marry the prince to his daughter lady Mar∣jory
Douglas, which accordingly was accom∣plished,
notwithstanding the former contract.</P>
<P>The earl of March being a man of a great
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit, highly resented this affront, turned an
enemy to his country, and determined to do
it all the mischief in his power.</P>
<P>He committed the care of his castle of
Dunbar to his nephew sir Robert Maitland
of Leithington, renounced his allegiance to
his lawful sovereign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> withdrew to England
with a considerable retinue of his friends and
followers, was well received by king Henry,
who gave him possession of several lands, and
settled an annuity of 500 merks sterling up∣on
him, became a liege man to the king of
England, and did him many signal services a∣gainst
his native country.</P>
<P>He entered into a strict friendship with sir
Henry Piercy, and other English borderers,
the constant enemies of the Scotch nation, and
with them invaded Scotland with a conside∣rable
force, made great havock, and destroy-all
with fire and sword wherever he came;
for which he was most justly outlawed and
forfeited: and being one of the best generals
of his time, the English gained several ad∣vantages
over the Scots under his conduct,
particularly at Homildon, in 1402, and at the
battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, where the vic∣tory
was chiefly ascribed to the earl of March's
military skill.</P>
<P>After all, he became weary of distressing
his native country, and made application to
Robert duke of Albany, governor of Scot∣land,
for a pardon, who gave him a favour∣able
answer; upon which he came to Scot∣land,
and was restored to all his estates and
honours by the governor, <HI>anno</HI> 1409, and liv∣ed
peaceably in his own country all the re∣mainder
of his days.</P>
<P>He married Christian, daughter of sir Wil∣liam
Seton of that ilk, ancestor of the earls of
Winton, by whom he had six sons and one
daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> earl of Murray.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>Gavin Dunbar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 447.</NOTE> a brave soldier.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Colin Dunbar.</HI></P>

mill of Mersington, in Berwickshire, to Ro∣bert
Lauder of Edrington, 12th September
1489.—All these four brothers are men∣tioned
in a charter in our public records.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. ad ann. 1425, &amp; char∣ter in Mac∣Farlane's book of ori∣nal writes, p. 374.</NOTE></P>
<P>6. <HI>David Dunbar</HI> of Cockburn, whose on∣ly
daughter and heiress, Mariota, married A∣lexander
earl of Crawfurd.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="463"/>
His daughter, lady <HI>Janet,</HI> married, 1st, to
John lord Seton; and, 2dly, to sir Adam
Johnston of that ilk.</P>
<P>The earl died in 1416, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. GEORGE, twelfth earl of March, who
was one of the commissioners appointed to
treat with the English about the redemption
of king James I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1423, which was hap∣pily
accomplished the year thereafter, and the
earl had the honour of knighthood conferred
upon him at the solemnity of the king's co∣ronation.</P>
<P>Though it does not appear that this earl
was ever guilty of any bad practices against
the state, yet the ravages and devastations,
committed by his father against his country,
during his rebellion, made many good sub∣jects
enemies to his family. They endea∣voured
to prepossess the king against him, and
to convince him that it was not in the power
of a governor to restore to his estate, and
fully to pardon so great and formidable a re∣bel
as his father was, who had been justly
outlawed and forfeited by the Iaws of the
land.</P>
<P>The earl was apprehended, and committed
prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh; but the
king would suffer nothing to be done against
him contrary to law: he therefore called a
parliament to meet at Perth, in order for his
trial, on 10th January 1434.</P>
<P>The earl pled, that his father had been
fully pardoned by the duke of Albany, then
governor of Scotland, and that he had never
been guilty of any crime against the state.</P>
<P>The advocates for the king replied, that
the power of restoring rebels and exiles was
lodged in the king alone, and never in the
person of a governor.</P>
<P>At last, after long debate, the parliament
passed sentence against him, in these words:
<Q REND="inline">"<HI>Quod ratione forisfacturae domini Georgii de

ac esse, spectare, et pertinere debere, tam in
possessorio quam in petitorio, ad dominum

<P>The earldom of March was thus annexed
to the crown, where it remained till king
James III. conferred it upon his unnatural
brother Alexander duke of Albany, <HI>anno</HI> 1478.</P>
<P>Yet such was the king's goodness and
bounty to this earl, that he bestowed upon
him a pension out of the earldom of Buchan,
(then in the crown) which supported him ac∣cording
to his quality during his life.</P>
<P>We have not been able to discover to whom
this earl was married, but it is certain he left
issue a son,</P>
<P>XVI. PATRICK DUNBAR, who, in ma∣ny
authentic documents, is designed <HI>filius et

when he got a pension from the king
of 400 merks <HI>per annum,</HI> the very year after

no inconsiderable sum in those days, and suf∣ficiently
shows the king's lenity and good-will
towards the family.</P>
<P>It appears also, that the parliament only
forfeited his lands that held of the king; for
we find that this Patrick, and his heirs, pos∣sessed
the lands and barony of Kilconquhar
in Fife, which was the undoubted property of
the earls of March; but they held these lands
of the bishop of St. Andrews, who granted a
new charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of ori∣ginal charter belonging to MacFarlane.</NOTE> <HI>Patricio Dunbar, filio et haeredi

<P>AS the origin and descent of the noble

of the earl of Home, 2. sir David, of whom
this noble family is lineally descended.</P>

<P>He died in April 1648, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>X. Sir PATRICK HUME, eighth baron of
Polwarth, who was scarce seven years old at
his father's death.</P>
<P>He had an education suitable to his birth,
and was chosen knight for the shire of Ber∣wick,
to the parliament 1665, where he soon
discovered an extraordinary genius, and great
abilities. He strenuously opposed the court
in every measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state,</NOTE> when he thought there was
the least encroachment upon the liberties of
his country; and as the whole behaviour and
conduct of this great man, is fully narrated in
the lives of the officers of state, page 240,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> we shall only here briefly mention the
most remarkable occurrences of his life.</P>
<P>In 1674, he went to London with the
duke of Hamilton and earl of Tweeddale, to
apply for redress of some grievances during
the duke of Lauderdale's administration.</P>
<P>In 1675, some disturbances happening in
the country, with regard to the militia, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
he protested and took instruments against it,
in such bold and daring terms, that the coun∣cil,
for his insolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> (as they called it) first
declared him incapable of all public trust, then
sent him prisoner to the tolbooth of Edinburgh,
then to Dunbarton castle, and from thence
to the castle of Stirling, where he suffer∣ed
a long and tedious confinement, but was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
last set at liberty by the interest of his relati∣on
the countess of Northumberland; but he,
believing he had several enemies at court, re∣tired
first to England, then to Geneva, and at
last to Holland, where he was greatly cares∣sed
by the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>In 1685, he came over to Scotland with
the earl of Argyle; and upon the suppression
of that rebellion, he narrowly escaped being
made prisoner; he again retired to Holland,
where he remained, till he came over with
the prince of Orange in 1688.</P>
<P>He was chosen a member of the conventi∣on
<PB N="447" REF="468"/>
which sat down at Edinburgh in March
1789, was very instrumental in getting the
crown settled upon their royal highnesses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in can∣cellaria, here∣dibus mascu∣lis de corpore suo et eorum haered. qui∣buscunque.</NOTE> was
immediately named one of the new privy
council by king William and queen Mary, and
was raised to the dignity of the peerage, by
the title of lord Polwarth of Polwarth, the
26th December 1690; and by the patent; the
king adds to his armorial bearing, in a surtout,
an orange proper, ensigned with an imperial
crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 243.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as a lasting mark of his Majesty's
esteem and regard for the family of Polwarth.</P>
<P>He was constituted sheriff-principal of Ber∣wick-shire,
<HI>anno</HI> 1692, one of the extraordi∣nary
lords of session, <HI>anno</HI> 1693, lord high
chancellor of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1696, and was
further dignified with the title of earl of
Marchmont,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid▪ et chart. penes com. de Marchmont.</NOTE> viscount Blassonberry, lord Pol∣warth
of Polwarth, Redbraes and Greenlaw,
23d April 1697.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he was named one of the
commissioners of the treasury and admiralty,
and was appointed his majesty's high com∣missioner
to the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which met at Edin∣burgh,
19th July 1698.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of queen Anne to the
crown, he was named one of the privy coun∣cil,
and was appointed her majesty's high com∣missioner
to the general assembly of the kirk
of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1702, and discharged his
duty in all the high offices he enjoyed, with
great sufficiency, candor, and fidelity.</P>
<P>As his commissions of lord chancellor and
sheriff of Berwick tell upon the death of king
William, her majesty queen Anne immediate∣ly
conferred the first upon the earl of Seafield,
and the other upon the earl of Home. The
earl of Marchmont continued to act with the
same publick spirit as formerly, and in the first
parliament of queen Ange, <HI>anno</HI> 1703, he
moved to bring in a bill, for settling the suc∣cession
on princess Sophia, dutchess dowager
of Hanover, the next protestant heir; but
this motion was dropped at that time.</P>
<P>He was a great promoter of the union, the
chief motive whereof was the protestant suc∣cession,
than which he had nothing more at
heart.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of king George I. to the
throne, he was immediately restored to the high
sheriff-ship of Berwick, and made one of the
lords of police. He died, in the 84th year of
his age, <HI>anno</HI> 1724.</P>
<P>By Grizel his wife, a daughter of sir Tho∣mas
Ker of Cavers, he had issue three sons
and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Patrick,</HI> lord Polwarth, who, as lord
high treasurer of Scotland, sat in the parlia∣ment
<HI>anno</HI> 1698. He married, Ist, Elizabeth,
daughter of sir James Home of Home-castle,
in the kingdom of Ireland; 2dly, lady Jean,
daughter of Charles earl of Home, but died
without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1710.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Alexander,</HI> who succeeded his father.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>Andrew Hume</HI> of Kimmergham,
who being bred to the law, became one of the
senators of the college of justice. He marri∣ed
Elizabeth, daughter of John Douglas, Esq;
and had issue.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Grizel,</HI> married to George
Baillie of Jerviswood, Esq; one of the commis∣sioners
of the treasury, and had issue.</P>

Dunglass, baronet, without issue.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Juliana,</HI> married to Charles Bil∣lingham,
Esq; and had issue.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to James lord Tor∣phichen,
and had issue.</P>
<P>XI. ALEXANDER, second earl of March∣mont,
was a man of good parts, great learning,
and knowledge in the laws. He was chosen
into the parliament of Scotland, often before
the union. In 1704, he was made one of
the senators of the college of justice in Scot∣land,
and soon after one of the privy-coun∣cil
and exchequer. His place in the session
he resigned in favours of his brother sir An∣drew,
upon his being appointed, in March
1715, envoy extraordinary to the courts of
Denmark and Prussia. In December 1716, he
was made clerk register for Scotland.</P>
<P>In January 1721, he was appointed first
ambassador in the congress to be held at Cam∣bray,
and in March following, made his pub∣lick
entry into that city, with a splendor and
magnificence becoming the British nation.</P>
<P>In 1725, he, by a commission from the king,
was invested with the most noble order of the
thistle.</P>
<P>In 1726, he was sworn one of the privy
council to his majesty.</P>
<P>In 1733, he was removed from all his offices.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter and heiress
of sir George Campbell of Cesnock, on which
account this family has added the name of
Campbel to that of Hume. By her he had
four sons and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> who died in 1724.</P>

<HEAD>KEITH Earl MARISHAL.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY and remotest antiquity are
agreed, that the family of Keith is one
of the most ancient and illustrious the Scotch
nation ever has produced: a family, fruitful
in a race of great men, who, not indebted to
the nobility of their origin, have always re∣flected
greater glory on their progenitors, on
the hereditary titles and offices they enjoyed,
than they ever deduced from them.</P>
<P>Our best antiquaries derive their origin from
a certain great man called Robert, who per∣formed
glorious exploits against the Danes,
when they invaded Scotland with a numerous
army in the reign of king Malcolm II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, A∣bercrombie, vol. 1. p. 207. Stewart's hist. of the royal family, and many other authors.</NOTE> tho' some
trace their origin much higher; however,
this hero remarkaby distinguished himself at
the battle of Barry or Camustone in Angus,
where, with his own hand, he killed the fa∣mous
Camus, general and champion of the
Danish army, whereby the Scots gained a
compleat victory, <HI>anno</HI> 1010.</P>
<P>King Malcolm, in recompence of his great
and signal services, bestowed upon him several
lands, particularly the barony of Keith in East-Lothian,
from which his posterity assumed
their sirname. He also appointed him here∣ditary
great marishal of Scotland, which high
office hath continued in his family, and hath
never been enjoyed by any other since that
time.</P>
<P>Of this great warrior was lineally descend∣ed,
Herveus, or Hervieus de Keth, of whom
we have many authentic documents in the ar∣chives
of the kingdom, which sufficiently prove
that he was great marishal of Scotland, and
proprietor of the lands and barony of Keth;
and as he was undoubted progenitor of this il∣lustrious
family, from him we deduce their
descent by unquestionable vouchers.</P>
<P>I. HERVEUS de KETH, great marishal of
Scotland, flourished in the reign of king Da∣vid
I. who succeeded to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1124,
and died <HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>This Herveus had a dispute with the abbot
and convent of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, penes MacFarlane, p. 72.</NOTE> who claimed the church
of Keth, in the village of this Herveus, de∣signed
<HI>Herveus de Keth marescallus regis Sco∣tiae,</HI>
at a convention held on that cause, to
which J. bishop of Glasgow, and R. abbot of
Jedworth, are witnesses, <HI>inter annos</HI> 1164 <HI>et</HI>
1174, in which last year the bishop died.</P>
<P>That there had been many meetings and
conventions about this contest, sufficiently
appears from the writs in the chartulary of
Kelso.</P>
<P><PB N="449" REF="470"/>
At last the pope interposed his authority,
and Joceline bishop of Glasgow, and Osbert
prior of Paisley, were delegated by him as
judges of the plea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 73.</NOTE> which had long sublisted
between the monks of Kelchou, and Herveus
great marishal, about the church of Keth, in
the village of the said Herveus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their
sentence in favours of the monastery was con∣firmed
by Richard bishop of St. Andrews,
who died <HI>anno</HI> 1178;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 74.</NOTE> and Joceline having
been constituted bishop of Glasgow, <HI>anno</HI>
1174,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> the controversy must have been deter∣mined
between these two periods.</P>
<P>It may here be observed, that of old there
were two Keiths; that which belonged to
this family was promiscuously called Keith-Hervey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 67, &amp; Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
and Keith-Marishal; the other, which
sometime belonged to the Frasers, was called
Keith-Symons, or Keith-Hundely (now Hum∣by;)
but the great marishals soon became
proprietors of both, as will be shown here∣after.</P>
<P>Herveus de Keth lived to a great age,
died betwixt the years 1190 and 1195, and
was father of</P>
<P>II. MALCOLMUS de KETH, who, in a
donation to the monastery of Arbroath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Arbroath, pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 105.</NOTE> is de∣signed
son of Herveus de Keth, great mari∣shal
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1178.</P>
<P>And in a donation to the monastery of
Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, p 127, 128, and 132.</NOTE> concerning the teinds of the miln of
of Molla, Malcolm, son of Herveus de Keth,
great marishal of Scotland, is a witness <HI>anno</HI>
1185.</P>
<P>He is also mentioned in another donation
to the same monastery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 228.</NOTE> together with Robert
de Ednem, Thomas de Heriz, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the

<P>This Malcolm appears to have died before
his father, for we never find him designed

who is said to have been progenitor of
those who assumed Marishal for their sir∣name,
of whom there were several families
in Scotland afterwards; but some historians
have most erroncously taken them for great
marishals of Scotland, tho' it is most certain
that that office was never enjoyed by any fa∣mily
but the Keiths, as before observed.</P>
<P>III. PHILIP de KETH, great marishal of
Scotland, eldest son of Malcolm, succeeded his
grandfather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary o Arbroath, p 153.</NOTE> and in a donation to the mona∣stery

he meddled in no public affairs, but re∣tired
to his castle of Dunotter, from whence
he never stirred abroad, and was therefore nick∣named,
by the common people, William in the

<P>XIX. GEORGE, fifth earl marishal, eldest

the great seal of a vast number of lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
to George earl marishall, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was a man of fine natural parts, which,
by the care of his grandfather, were greatly
improved by a liberal education. He studied
several years with the best masters at the uni∣versities
abroad; and, in the course of his tra∣vels,
he visited most of the courts of Europe,
in the space of about seven years.</P>
<P>When he returned to his native country,
he soon gained the esteem of every body, and
was acknowledged to be one of the finest
gentlemen of the age.</P>
<P>He became greatly in favour with king
James VI. who appointed him one of his pri∣vy
council.</P>
<P>In the year 1589, he was sent ambassador
extraordinary to the court of Denmark, to
espouse princess Anne, a daughter of that
crown, in name of king James VI. and being
possessed of one of the greatest estates in this
country, he appeared with all the lustre and
magnificence with which the wealth of Scot∣land
could adorn him, and that mostly upon
his own charges. He had in his retinue Andrew
Keith lord Dingwall, sir James Scrimgeour of
Dudhope, Mr. John Skeen king's advocate,
Mr. George Young arch-dean of St. Andrews,
and several other persons of distinction, and
acquirred himself so much to the satisfaction
of the king and ministry, that they granted
him a full, ample, and honourable acquittance
and discharge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 8th. where part of his discharge is narrated.</NOTE> by an act of the privy council,
in which are inserted several ancedots, very
much to his honour, and wherein his great a∣bilities
and fidelity are fully set furth.</P>
<P>In the year 1593, this earl made a noble
foundation of a college at Aberdeen, called
the marishal college, and endowed it with
sufficient funds for the support and mainte∣nance
of a principal and four professors of phi∣losophy,
of which this family are perpetual
patrons; and the seal of the college bears the
arms of earl marishal quartered with those
of the town of Aberdeen.</P>
<P>After king James went up to England, his
esteem and favour for the earl never abated.
He conferred upon him the greatest honours
that a subject is capable of, and appointed him
his high commissioner, or vice-roy, to repre∣sent
his royal person in the parliament of
Scotland in the year 1609.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> He served his
majesty in every station of life, with fidelity,
honour, and reputation.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Margaret, daughter of
Alexander fourth lord Home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Privy seal.</NOTE> by whom he
had a son,</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> lord Keith,—and two daughters.</P>

<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> who got from his father the

2. Margaret,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contract pe∣nes Methven, ad ann. 1652.</NOTE> who died unmarried. 3.

<P>2. <HI>John de Keith,</HI> who was also provided
to the lands of Benholm, by his father's de∣stination,
failing heirs of his brother's body;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Privy seal.</NOTE>
but these lands were sold by James in the
reign of king Charles I. and whether John
had any succession or not we can give no ac∣count.</P>
<P>This noble lord died at his castle of Dun∣otter,
April 2d 1623, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XX. WILLIAM, sixth earl marishal, who
got charters under the great seal of many
lands and baronies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to William earl marishal,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was a man of great learning and inte∣grity,
which made him highly esteemed
by king Charles I. who called him to his
privy council, where he soon discovered him∣self
to be well affected to the crown and go∣vernment
in church and state.</P>
<P><PB N="456" REF="477"/>
He married lady Margaret Erskine, daugh∣ter

<P>He died in the flower of his age, univer∣sally
lamented, 28th October 1635, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XXI. WILLIAM, seventh earl marishal,
who was a great loyalist, and adhered firmly
to the interest of the royal family, during all
the time of the civil war.</P>
<P>He raised a troop of horse upon his own
charge, marched with them into England, in
hopes of procuring the king's liberation in
the year 1648, and fought gallantly upon their
head at Preston, where the king's army was
defeated, and the earl narrowly escaped being
made prisoner: however, he got safe back to
Dunotter castle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Nisbet's appendix, and M. S. hist. of the family.</NOTE> where he had the honour
to entertain king Charles II. the duke of
Buckingham, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> in the year 1650.
He never left his majesty while he staid in
Scotland, and gladly would have accompanied
him into England, had he not been expressly
ordered by the king to remain with the earls
of Crawfurd and Glencairn, to govern the na∣tion;
but while he was busily employed in
raising forces for the royal cause, he was sur∣prised,
with several of his friends, at Elli∣ot
in Angus, by a strong party of English
horse, and sent prisoner to London by sea;
where, after a ten year's confinement in the
tower, which he bore with great sirmness and
constancy, he was released at the happy re∣storation
of king Charles II. who, in recom∣pence
of his great merit and sufferings, nomi∣nated
him one of his privy council in the year
1660,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. arch.</NOTE> and soon thereafter made him lord pri∣vy
seal, which office he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Seton, daugh∣ter
of George earl of Winton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> by whom he
had four daughters.</P>

<P>The earl dying without male issue in the
year 1661, his estate and honours devolved
upon his brother,</P>
<P>XXI. GEORGE, eighth earl marishal, a
man of undaunted courage and intrepidity,
who, in his younger days, served in the wars
in France, and soon rose to the degree of a
colonel; but when the unhappy civil war
broke out, he returned to his native country,
and immediately joined the loyalists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family.</NOTE> and suf∣fered
many hardships during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he usurpation.</P>
<P>He died in an advanced age in the year
1694, leaving issue, by lady Mary Hay, daugh∣ter
of George earl of Kinnoul, one only son
and successor,</P>
<P>XXII. WILLIAM, ninth earl marishal, a
man of an active spirit, solid judgment, great
hospitality, and a true lover of his country,
and so strongly attached to the interest of the
Stewart family, that he never came into the
measures of the court, during all the reign of
king William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and a great part of queen
Anne's.</P>
<P>He opposed with all his interest the union
of the two kingdoms in every article, as being
inconsistent with the liberty, and derogatory
to the honour of his country in general, and
that of his hereditary office of great marishal
in particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestatlarge in Crawfurd's peerage, page 323, and Nis∣bet's append. p. 10.</NOTE> wherefore he entered a solemn
protest against it, which is still upon record,
and will be a lasting monument of the sincere
regard he had for the ancient privileges of his
country.</P>
<P>He was elected one of the sixteen Scotch
peers to serve in the parliament of Great Bri∣tain,
in the year 1710.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Drummond, daugh∣ter
of James earl of Perth, lord high chancel∣lor
of Scotland, by lady Jean Douglas, daugh∣ter
of William marquis of Douglas, by whom
he had issue two sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Keith,</HI> who betaking himself to
a military life, served in the wars abroad,
rose to the highest degree in the army, and
was inferior to no general of his time for mi∣litary
capacity. After the battle of Dum∣blain,
where he was engaged with his brother
earl marishal, he went abroad to seek prefer∣ment
at the Spanish court; but not finding
a quick promotion there, he entered into the
service of Peter the Great, emperor of Russia,
who soon promoted him to the rank of a ge∣neral
officer. He afterwards went into the
service of Frederick III. king of Prussia, who
raised him to the rank of a field marshal; but
after many signal services, when the right
wing of the Prussian army was surprised by
<PB N="457" REF="478"/>
the Austrians under marshal Daun, at Hoch∣kirchen,
he making a glorious defence, was
unfortunately killed, 14th October 1758, and
was buried in the church-yard of Hochkir∣chen;
but the king of Prussia, who could not
sufficiently regret the loss of so great a com∣mander,
had his corpse taken up and sent to
Berlin, where he was interred a second time,
with great military honours.</P>
<P>The earl's Ist daughter, lady <HI>Mary,</HI> was
married to John earl of Wigton, whose only
child, lady Clementina Fleming, married to
Charles, tenth lord Elphingston, to whom she
hath a numerous issue.</P>

lady Mary, married to Kenneth lord For∣trose,
to whom she had a numerous issue.</P>
<P>The earl died in the year 1712, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XXIII. GEORGE, tenth earl Marishal, who
having been engaged in the rebellion 1715,
was attainted of treason, and his estate and
honours forfeited to the crown. He went
beyond seas, and at different times resided at
the courts of France, Spain, Rome, and Prussia.</P>
<P>In 1750, he was appointed ambassador ex∣traordinary
by his Prussian majesty to the court
of France, and was afterwards invested with
the order of the Black Eagle.</P>
<P>In 1759, he went by Turin to the court
of Spain, being, as was generally believed,
sent there from the king of Prussia, who ap∣pointed
him governor of Neufchatell.</P>
<P>In the same year 1759, there was a pardon
obtained for him from king George II. upon
which he came over to England, has since suc∣ceeded
to the estate of Kintore, and went a∣gain

from the reign of that king, since which aera
the uninter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>ed possession of it, down to

or parliament, at Forsar, in the begin∣ning

was Martacns, Thane, afterwards earl of

his possessions, as was the custom of those

<P>He is also said to have had another daugh∣ter
<PB N="460" REF="481"/>
married to the lord Lyle, <HI>Vide</HI> page 433d
of this work.</P>
<P>Earl Gratney died before the year 1300,
and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>X. DONALD, twelfth earl of Marr, often
designed Donald Bayne.</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and merit,
a firm and steady friend of king Robert Bruce,
whom he joined as soon as he begun publick∣ly
to assert his title to the crown; but had
the misfortune to be taken prisoner fighting
gallantly in defence of the liberties of his
country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 1014.</NOTE> at the battle of Methven, <HI>anno</HI> 1306.</P>
<P>He was immediately sent prisoner to Lon∣don,
where he was closely confined for the
space of eight years; but was at last exchan∣ged
for an English nobleman, who had been
taken prisoner at the battle of Bannockburn,
and obtained a safe conduct from king Ed∣ward
of England to return to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. III. p. 488.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1314.</P>
<P>He got several charters from king Robert
Bruce, <HI>Donaldo comiti de Marr, viz.</HI> charter of
all his thanage of Colvith in Angus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al∣so
charter of the lands of Saline in File,
Mount-Blairy in Banff-shire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with char∣ters
of several other lands and baronies, too
numerous to be here inferrted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart in ar∣chi. tam. de Marr.</NOTE> in the years
1324, 1328, and 1329, in all which he is
designed the king's nephew.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Thomas Randolph, earl
of Murray, regent of Scotland, in the minority
of king David II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of the royal family.</NOTE> Donald earl of Marr was
elected to succeed him in that high office.</P>
<P>He married Isabel, daughter of sir Alexan∣der
Stewart of Bonkill, sister of John Stewart
earl of Angus, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Thomas,</HI> his heir,—and one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William first
earl of Douglas, of whom more afterwards.</P>
<P>This great man lost his life in the service
of his country, at the battle of Duplin, <HI>anno</HI>
1332, and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XI. THOMAS, thirteenth earl of Marr, also a
man of great abilities, a faithful and loyal
subject of king David Bruce, in all the vari∣ous
vicissitudes of fortune in that long reign,
during which there was scarce any public
transaction wherein the earl of Marr was not
concerned.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the ambassadors
extraordinary by the estates of the kingdom,
to treat with the English about king David's
liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p. 711.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1351.</P>
<P>He was one of the hostages for his ransom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. VI. P. 212, and 323.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1357, and was constituted great cham∣berlain
of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>He was again named one of the ambassa∣dors
to treat with the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1362.</P>
<P>He was afterwards one of the guarantees
of a treaty with that nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 395, 633, 760, &amp; tom. VII. p. 30.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1369, and
again got a safe conduct to go up to England
to negotiate, <HI>anno</HI> 1373, and returned the
year thereafter.</P>
<P>This earl obtained a charter of confirmati∣on
from king David II. to him and his heirs
whatsomever, of the whole lands and lordship
of Garrioch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chivis fam. de Marr.</NOTE> to be holden by him and his
heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as freely as David earl of Hunt∣ington
held the same.</P>
<P>There are amongst the archives of the fa∣mily
of Marr, many charters to their friends,
and vassals, which do great honour to, and is a
good proof of the grandeur of, this noble fa∣mily;
but they are too numerous to be here
inserted.</P>
<P>This earl married, 1st, Mary, daughter
and heiress of Alan earl of Menteith, from
whom, according to a good author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 150.</NOTE> he was
divorced upon false and unjust grounds.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Margaret Stewart,
daughter, and at last sole heiress, of Thomas
earl of Angus, who, after his death, mar∣ried
to her second husband William earl
of Douglas, and by him was mother of George
Douglas earl of Angus.</P>
<P>Earl Thomas dying without issue, <HI>anno</HI>
1377, in him ended the whole male line of
Gratney, eleventh earl of Marr, and his estate
and honours devolved upon his only sister,</P>
<P>XI. MARGARET, countess of Marr, mar∣ried,
as before observed, to William first earl
of Douglas, who, according to the courtesy of
Scotland at that time, became earl of Marr,
lord of Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in her right, and was
fourteenth earl.</P>
<P>There are innumerable charters and other
vouchers in the archives of the families of
Douglas and Marr, as well as in Rymer's
Foedera Angliae, instructing the above, with
which we shall not trouble our readers.</P>
<P>By William earl of Douglas and Marr, she
had issue a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who succeeded his father and mo∣ther
in the earldoms of Douglas and Marr,
lordship of Garioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—and a daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Isabel,</HI> countess of Marr, of whom
more hereafter.</P>
<P>Margaret, countess of Douglas and Marr,
having been divorced from her first husband,
married, 2dly, sir John Swinton, but to him
she had to issue.</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, second earl of Douglas, and
fifteenth earl of Marr, married lady Isabel

Stewart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the royal family.</NOTE> daughter of king Robert II. by whom
he had one son, who died in infancy; and he
being killed at the battle of Otterburn, <HI>anno</HI>
1388, without any surviving lawful issue, the
earldom of Douglas went to his brother Ar∣chibald,
son of his father's second marriage,
and the earldom of Marr, lordship of Gar∣rioch,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> devolved upon his sister,</P>
<P>XII. Lady ISABEL DOUGLAS, countess
of Marr, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before mentioned. She mar∣ried,
1st, sir Malcolm Drummond of that ilk,
or Cargill, who, upon the death of her bro∣ther,
in her sight became earl of Marr, of
which there are many vouchers both in the
public register, and amongst the writs of the
family of Marr; also <HI>ide</HI> title Drummond
earl of Perth. But sir Malcolm died without
issue, and she married, 2dly, sir Alexander
Stewart, earl of Buchan, fourth lawful son of
king Robert II. and made a resignation of the
estate and honours of Marr, lordship of Gai∣rioch,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the king's hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for new in∣feftment

sir Alexander besieged the countess in her

<P>There is also an instrument of sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of the

by king Robert III. dated the 21st of
January 1404-5, by which it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> that
the destination in the above resignation of
the 12th of August 1404, whether volunta∣ry
or by force, was now altered and set aside.</P>
<P>This earl was truly a man of great parts
and magnanimity, equally skilled in the arts
of peace and war.</P>
<P>He was appointed ambassador extraordina∣ry
to treat of a peace with the court of Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom, VIII. p. 450, and 461.</NOTE>
and got a safe conduct from that crown
(<HI>Alexandro comiti de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> et Garrioch</HI>) to go
up to London with seventy horses in his re∣tinue,
<HI>anno</HI> 1406.</P>
<P>He got another safe conduct to go up to
England and negotiate with that court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 500</NOTE> 1407.</P>
<P>He had the chief command of the royal ar∣my
against Donald earl of Ross, lord of the
Isles, at the memorable and bloody battle of
Harlaw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. and p. 361st of this work.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1411, where he behaved with
the valour and conduct of a brave and expe∣rienced
general.</P>
<P>In the year 1416 he was again appointed
ambassador extraordinary to the court of Eng∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IX p. 418. and tom. X. p. 491.</NOTE>
and soon thereafter he was constituted
lord warden of the marches.</P>
<P>Lady Isabel Douglas, countess of Marr, died
<HI>anno</HI> 1419, without issue, and in her ended
the whole line of Donald, only son of
Gratney, eleventh earl of Marr; the repre∣sentation
therefore of this most noble and an∣tient
family undoubtedly devolved upon Ro∣bert
lord Erskme, lineally descended of lady
Helen, only daughter of the said eleventh earl,
as before observed.</P>
<P>Alexander earl of Marr, in right of his
wise, in manner above-mentioned, being
a man of an enterprizing genius, became
weary of a peaceable life at home; he there∣fore
raised a large company of gentlemen,
<PB N="462" REF="483"/>
his followers, carried them to Flanders, and,
with them, entered into the service of John
duke of Burgundy, where he and his follow∣ers
performed such feats of chivalry at the
siege of Liege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromby.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as acquired great reputa∣tion
both to himself and his countrymen.</P>
<P>He then married Jean dutchess or countess
of Brabant, and, in her right, claimed that so∣vereignty;
but the Brabanters refusing to sub¦mit
to the government of a foreigner, and the
countess dying within little more than a year
after their marriage, he returned home great∣ly
incensed against the Brabanters.</P>
<P>He therefore immediately fitted out a fleet,
and failed to the coast of Flanders, where he
attacked a large fleet of the Brabanters re∣turning
from Dantzick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hathornden, &amp;c.</NOTE> richly ladened, all
which he took, pillaged and destroyed, and
returned to Scotland with vast wealth and
booty.</P>
<P>Though this sir Alexander had no right to
the earldom of Marr, but by his charters
from Isabel countess thereof, as is above nar∣rated,
whereby the whole was limited to the

failing, to return to her heirs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet soon
after his return to Scotland, he made a re∣signation
of the earldom of Marr, lordship of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> into the king's hands for new
infeftment to himself, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon which the
king granted a new charter to the said sir A∣lexander,
and Thomas Stewart his natural
son, and their heirs-male; which failing, to
the king and his heirs whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> dated 28th
May 1426.</P>
<P>Thomas, the natural son, died before his
father, without issue, and sir Alexander him∣self
died in 1435, also without lawful chil∣dren;
whereupon ensued a long contest about
the earldom of Marr, betwixt the king, as
having right by the resignation and charter a∣bove
narrated, and Robert lord Erskine, who,
as this earldom appears to have descended to
heirs general, had an undoubted right and title
thereto; for the whole descendents of Grat∣ney,
eleventh earl of Marr, were now failed,
except those of his daughter,</P>
<P>I. Lady ELYNE, before-mentioned, who
married sir John Menteith, lord of Arran, by
whom she had issue only one daughter,</P>
<P>II. CHRISTIAN MENTEITH, married
to sir Edward Keith, to whom she had an on∣ly
child,</P>
<P>III. JANET KEITH, who married Tho∣mas
seventh lord Erskine, to whom she had
issue</P>
<P><HI>Robert,</HI> lord Erskine, who was undoubted
representative and heir to one of the most
antient earldoms in the kingdom, and was
accordingly served heir before the sheriff of
Aberdeen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several re∣tours in the archives of the family of Marr.</NOTE> 23d April 1436, to Elizabeth
countess of Marr, the last descendent of the
body of Donald twelfth earl of Marr, only
son of Gratney eleventh earl, who was the
common great great grand-father, or <HI>atavus,</HI>
of Isabel last countess of Marr, and of Robert
lord Erskine, as above deduced.</P>
<P>We shall only here observe, before we
proceed to the history of the family of Er∣skine,
that though the earls of Marr, as far
back as we have any records, were amongst
the greatest and most illustrious families in
the kingdom, yet we find few or none of
their descendents who assumed Marr for their
sirname.</P>
<P>Nicol de Marr is witness in a charter of
king Malcolm IV. to the town of Inverness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haddington's collections.</NOTE>
<HI>ante</HI> 1165, in which year king Malcolm died.</P>
<P>Thomas earl of Marr grants a charter to
John de Marr, of some lands in Aberdeen-shire,

<P>But we cannot connect any of these with
this family.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="peerage">
<HEAD>ERSKINE Earl of MARR.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our antiquaries agree, that this no∣ble
family is of very great antiquity;
but the history of its origin, like that of
most other antient families, is chiefly found∣ed
on tradition.</P>
<P>Some authors deduce their descent from a
noble Florentine, who is said to have come
to Scotland in the reign of king Kenneth II.</P>
<P>It is said by others, that in the reign of
king Malcolm II. a Scotsman of high distinc∣tion
having killed, with his own hand, En∣rique,
one of the Danish generals, at the bat∣tle
of Murthill, cut off his head, and, with
the bloody dagger in his hand, shewed it to
the king, and, in the Gaelic, said, Eris-skyne,
alluding to the head and dagger, and, in the
same language, also said, I intend to perform
greater actions than what I have done, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="463" REF="484"/>
whereupon king Malcolm imposed upon him
the sirname of Erskyne, and assigned him for
his armorial bearing, a hand holding a dagger,
with <HI>je pense plus</HI> for a motto, which hath
continued to be the crest and motto of this
noble family ever since.</P>
<P>But we shall insist no further on these tra∣ditional
accounts, and shall here only observe,
that it is most certain that this family had
vast possessions in the shires of Renfrew and
Air, in very early times, particularly the
lands, barony, and castle of Erskine, a beau∣tiful
seat upon the banks of the river Clyde.
Whether the Erskines gave their name to
their lands, or took it from them, we shall
not pretend to determine; but certain it is
there is no account, either from records or
tradition, of any persons being possessed of the
lands of Erskine before them.</P>
<P>The first of the family we can mention,
from any good authority, is,</P>
<P>I. HENRICUS, or HENRY de ERSKINE.
He was proprietor and lord of the barony of
Erskine in Renfrew-shire, and flourished in
the reign of king Alexander II.</P>
<P>In a donation of Amelick, brother of Mald∣win
earl of Lennox, of the patronage of the
church of Roseneath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley, penes com. de Dun∣donald.</NOTE> and tythes thereto be∣longing,
to the monastery of Paisley, <HI>Henricus
dominus de Erskine</HI> is a witness, in the year
1226.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>II. Sir JOHN, second lord of Erskine, by
whom there is a charter of some lands in Ren∣frew-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lections.</NOTE>
<HI>Roberto dicto Boyd, &amp;c.</HI> in the end
of the reign of king Alexander II.</P>
<P>In a charter of king Alexander III. <HI>domi∣nus
Johannes de Erskine, miles,</HI> together with
<HI>Radulphus de Insulis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley</NOTE> <HI>dominus de Duchal, &amp;c.</HI>
are witnesses, <HI>anno</HI> 1252.</P>
<P>He is witness also in another charter of a
donation to the monastery of Paisley by Wal∣ter
earl of Menteith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of the church of Cor∣monell,
<HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1262.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William de Erskine,</HI> who obtained from
his father some lands in the shire of Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of ori∣ginal writs, penes Mac-Farlane.</NOTE>
confirmed to him by James, lord high steward
of Scotland, the superior; but we can give
no account of his posterity.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>III. Sir JOHN, third lord of Erskine, who,
with many of his brave countrymen, was o∣bliged
to submit to the superior sorce of king
Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III. p. 657.</NOTE> of England, when he had over∣run
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>He lived after the year 1300, and left is∣sue
a son and successor,</P>
<P>IV. Sir JOHN, fourth lord of Erskine, who,
in his father's lifetime, obtained a grant of
some lands, <HI>in tenemento de Largis,</HI> and shire
of Air, confirmed to him by James lord high
steward of Scotland, <HI>Johanni de Erskine, filio
Johannis de Erskine, filii et haeredis Johannis
de Erskine, militis, &amp;c.</HI> to which Robert
bishop of Glasgow, sir Reginald de Crawfurd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of ori∣ginal writs, penes Mac-Farlane, vol. I.</NOTE>
sir John Erskine his father, and several others,
are witnesses. His uncle William is also men∣tioned
in that charter, which has no date,
but must have been before 1310, in which
year the lord high steward died.</P>
<P>He had issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William,</HI> his heir,—and three daugh∣ters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Mary,</HI> who married, 1st, sir Thomas
Bruce, brother to king Robert; but he being
taken prisoner by the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and put to
death at London, she married, 2dly, sir Ing∣ram
Morvile.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Alice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the royal family, p. 54.</NOTE> married to Walter lord high
steward of Scotland, to whom she had one
daughter, Jean, married to Hugh earl of Ross.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Agnes,</HI> married to sir William Living∣ston
of that ilk.</P>
<P>He died soon after his father, and was suc∣ceeded
by his son,</P>
<P>V. Sir WILLIAM, fifth lord of Erskine,
who, according to all our historians, was a
man of singular merit and bravery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercromby, &amp;c.</NOTE> and always
a firm adherent to king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>He joined, with his forces, the earl of Mur∣ray,
and sir James Douglas, when they in∣vaded
England in 1322, defeated all that op∣posed
them, and was knighted in the field un∣der
the banner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Craw∣furd, &amp;c.</NOTE> for the great services he did
in that expedition.</P>
<P>To whom this great man was married, we
have not been able to discover; but he left
issue four sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Robert,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Alan,</HI> who obtained from his fa∣ther
the lands of Barachan. He married Isa∣bel,
daughter and sole heiress of sir Pa∣trick
Inchmartine of that ilk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Fin∣later, &amp;c.</NOTE> and was an∣cestor
of the Erskines of Inchmartine. <HI>Vide</HI>
pages 263d and 687th of this work.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Andrew Erskine</HI> of Raploch.</P>
<P>4. Sir <HI>Archibald Erskine.</HI></P>
<P>Sir William died <HI>anno</HI> 1329, and was suc∣ceeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. Sir ROBERT, who was sixth lord of
Erskine, a great patriot, a brave soldier, and
an able statesman, as eminently loyal and faith∣ful
<PB N="464" REF="485"/>
to king David Bruce, as his father had
been to king Robert.</P>
<P>In king David's minority, he joined the
lord high steward, and was very instrumental
in recovering a great part of the country for
that prince, which had been over-run by the
English and the Baliol party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> while David was
in France.</P>
<P>After his return home, the king, sensible of
the great merit and faithful services of the lord
Erskine, appointed him constable, keeper
and captain of the castle of Stirling for life,
with all the privileges, devoirs, duties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which any of his predecessors, keepers there∣of,
enjoyed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and that office continued in this
family till the attainder of earl John, in 1715.</P>
<P>After the unfortunate battle of Durham,
<HI>Robertus dominus de Erskine, miles,</HI> was ap∣pointed,
by the estates of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p 618.</NOTE> one of the
ambassadors extraordinary to negotiate king
David's liberty, <HI>anno</HI> 1348.</P>
<P>And though his negotiation did not then
take effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv and lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> he was by his majesty appointed
great chamberlain of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1350.</P>
<P>In the years 1351, 1352, and 1354, he
was again nominated one of the ambassadors
to treat of the king's liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p. 711, 736, &amp; 791.</NOTE> in the last of
which years he offered himself and his son as
hostages.</P>
<P>In the year 1355,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 362.</NOTE> he went ambassador
from the estates of Scotland to the Pope.</P>
<P>He was also one of the ambassadors in
1357,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom VI. p. 17, &amp; 35.</NOTE> when the king's liberty was accom∣plished,
and gave his son as one of the ho∣stages
for his ransom.</P>
<P>This noble lord got a charter from Tho∣mas,
thirteenth earl of Marr, <Q REND="inline">"to and in sa∣vours
of his special consederate and cousin,
Robert lord Erskine, and Christian Keith

charter is confirmed by king David in a par∣liament
held at Scoon, <HI>anno regni</HI> 39 <HI>to</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>The king being now at liberty, and in full
possession of his kingdom, renewed the lord
Erskine's commission as lord great chamber∣lain
of Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, &amp; writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and likeways appointed
him justiciar benorth the river Forth, con∣stable
and keeper of the castles of Edinburgh
and Dunbarton.</P>
<P>In the year 1359, he was appointed am∣bassador
extraordinary in a very solemn em∣bassy
to the court of France, to renew the
antient league,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI.</NOTE> which had subsisted for so ma∣ny
centuries betwixt the two nations.</P>
<P>He went five times ambassador to Eng∣land,
between the years 1360 and 1366, in
which last year his two sons, Thomas and A∣lan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 534.</NOTE>
went with him.</P>
<P>In 1367, he was appointed warden of the
marches;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 570, and writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> and in this year we find him men∣tioned
as heretable sheriff of the county of
Stirling, which probably he had by successi∣on.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobility who, in
the year 1371,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 369, &amp; 382.</NOTE> ratified king Robert II.'s title
to the crown, and is said by our historians to
have been instrumental in his majesty's peace∣able
accession thereto. He continued in no
less favour with that prince than he had been
with his uncle king David,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. regis David &amp; Rob. II.</NOTE> from both which
kings he obtained several charters, under the
great seal, of many lands and baronies, and
had several other instances of the royal favour
and bounty conferred on him.</P>
<P>But as the brevity of this work will not
permit us to enumerate all the great actions
performed by this patriot in the service of
his king and country: we must refer our
readers to our historians, and the lives of the
officers of state, for a more particular account
of them; and shall only add, that during the
course of a long life, he was constantly em∣ployed
in the most arduous negotiations of
state, and enjoyed the greatest offices in the
kingdom, in all which he discharged his duty
with great ability, honour, and fidelity, e∣qually
to the satisfaction of his sovereigns and
fellow-subjects.</P>
<P>He married,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> 1st, Beatrix, daughter of sir
David Lindsay; 2dly, Christian, widow of
sir Edward Keith, and left issue three sons,
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Thomas,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Nichol,</HI> first of the Erskines of
Kinnoul, in Perth-shire, which family subsist∣ed
in the male-line, till the reign of king

<P>2. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir Walter Oli∣phant
of Aberdalgie, ancestor of lord Oli∣phant.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1385, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>VII. THOMAS, seventh lord Erskine, who
was one of the noble Scotch heirs that were
given as hostages for king David's ransom,
as before observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 399.</NOTE> and is then designed <HI>filius

<P>The lord Erskine, with his brother sir Ni∣chol,
(designed by Fordun, <HI>nobiles milites

<PB N="465" REF="486"/>
English, who had burnt the monastery of
Inchcolm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 399.</NOTE> that few or none of them escaped,
<HI>anno</HI> 1383.</P>
<P>This Thomas was a man of great ac∣complishments,
of singular worth and merit,
and highly esteemed both by kings Robert II.
and III. By the first he was continued in
his father's government of the castle of Stir∣ling;
and by the last he was appointed am∣bassador
extraordinary to treat with the En∣glish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VII. p. 788.</NOTE>

of which there was little probability by rea∣son
of her age, we hope we shall be pardoned
for inserting at large some of the steps
taken by this noble lord, for securing his
wife and her son's right thereto, as they are
somewhat curious, and tend to give light in∣to
the manners of those times.</P>
<P>There is an instrument of protestation
made in parliament to the king by Thomas

Isabel countess of Marr, the said sir Malcolm's

the king not to give any confirmation

<P>He further shewed, that Thomas lord Er∣skine,

<P>There is a precept for infefting Robert
lord Erskine, as heir to Isabel countess of
Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> sealed and dated November 1438.</P>
<P>And an instrument of sasine following
thereon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dated 21st November the same year.</P>
<P>After which lord Erskine took the title
of earl of Marr, lord of Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
granted many charters of lands belonging
thereto.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding that Robert lord Erskine
was acknowledged as earl of Marr, and acted
as such, yet he was never entirely in peace∣able
possession of that earldom; for king
James II.'s council got an act passed in his
first parliament, declaring, that whatsoever
lands his majesty's father died possessed of, or
had claimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> should remain with the king dur∣ing
his minority.</P>
<P>By an indenture betwixt the king's coun∣cil,
and Robert lord Erskine, calling himself
earl of Marr, it was agreed, for the guid and
quiet of the land, that the king shall deliver
up to lord Erskine, the castle of Kildrimmie,
to be kept by him till the king's majority;
which done, the said lord shall come before
the king, and three estates, and show his
rights and claims as far as law will. And
further, it is accordit, that half the revenues
belonging to the earldom of Marr, shall re∣main
with the said lord till the ending of the
plea; and that whenever the said lord shall
receive the castle of Kildrimmie, he shall de∣liver
up not only the castle of Marr, but
<PB N="467" REF="488"/>
likeways the castle of Dumbarton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Marr.</NOTE> dated 10th
August 1440.</P>
<P>There is a protest taken by said lord Er∣skine,
in the hands of Richard Cadie notar,
in the presence of the king and council, in
Stirling castle, 9th August 1442, complain∣ing
upon the chancellor for refusing to retour
him to the lordship of Garrioch, and put him
in possession of the castle of Kildrimmie, pro∣testing,
that he might and should be free to
intromit at his own hand with the haill lands
of Marr and Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly he immediately after be∣sieged
and took the castle of Kildrimmie,
whereupon the king seized the castle of Alloa.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>For the recovery of which there was an
indenture entered into between the king and
council on the one part, and lord Erskine on
the other, by which lord Erskine oblige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
himself to deliver up the castle of Kildrim∣mie
betwixt and the third July next, to any
the king should appoint, to be kept by them
till the king's majority, and then to be deliver∣ed
up to either of them who should be found
to have right to it, at the sight of the three
estates, and to account to the king at his ma∣jority
for the one half of the earldom of Marr.
And the king and council on their part, o∣bliged
themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat so soon as the castle
of Kildrimmie should be delivered up to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se
appointed by the king, his majesty should de∣liver
up to lord Erskine his castle of Alloa,
and all the furniture and warlike stores found
therein. This indenture is sealed by the king's
privy seal, and the seals of William bishop of
Glasgow, and of James of Livingston, then
keepers of the king's person; and the lords
of Graeme and Gray bind themselves as cauti∣oners
for the king and council's fulfilling their
part of the indentures: and on the part of
lord Erskine, his seal, and the seal of his son
and heir sir Thomas Erskine, is affixed. And
sir Henry Douglas of Lochleven, Thomas of
Wemyss, and William Auchterlony of Kelly,
bind themselves as cautioners for the father
and son's performing their part of the inden∣tures,
which bears date the 20th June 1448.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 4th September 1449, sir Thoma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Erskine appeared in parliament as procurator
for his father, and took instruments in the
hands of John Anthrie notar, that lord Er∣skine
was ready to fulfil the terms of the above
indenture, and that his right should not be
prejudised by lapse of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> he being willing
to submit all questions to be determined by a
full and free parliament, suspected persons,
burgesses, being removed.</P>
<P>There are many other protests taken by
Robert lord Erskine, and his son sir Thomas,
betwixt this time and the year 1456; but as
they are all to the same purpose with the last
mentioned one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> it is unnecessary to insert
more of them here.</P>
<P>At last, in the year 1457, the king brought
a reduction against sir Thomas, now lord Er∣skine
(his father being then dead) of his fa∣ther
lord Erskine's service,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> above-mentioned,
to Isabel countess of Marr.</P>
<P>The heads of the reduction are, 1<HI>st,</HI> That
lord Erskine ought not to have been served
heir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In pub. ar∣chiv.</NOTE> because there were no witnesses who
could swear to his being come of Elyne of
Marr, who was long since dead.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Because the said service was contra∣ry
to the act of parliament, anent the king's
keeping possession of all lands or rights his ma∣jesty's
father was in possession of, or had
claimed at the time of his decease.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> Because Isabel countess of Marr was
not the person who died last vested and fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ed
in that earldom, but Alexander Stewart
and Thomas his natural son, to both whom
the king was heir.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> Because the king himself was near∣est
heir to Isabel countess of Marr, as being
descended from Isabel of Marr, king Robert
Bruce's first queen, mother of princess Mar∣jory;
and Isabel of Marr being eldest daugh∣ter
of Gratney earl of Marr, ought to be pre∣ferred
to the descendents of Elyne her second
sister in the earldom of Marr, which was an
indivisable subject.</P>
<P>Upon these grounds an assize of error met
at Aberdeen, where the king himself was pre∣sent,
and they, by their verdict, dated 15th
May 1457, reduced the service of Robert
lord Erskine; and sound, that the king only
had right to the earldom of Marr, lordship of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This reduction was confirmed in parlia∣ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
5th November 1457.</P>
<P>But against all these proceedings, Thomas
lord Erskine, entered his protest; and he
and his posterity always continued to as∣sert
their right to the earldom of Marr, and
to complain of the violence with which they
said it was wrested from them.</P>
<P>At last, in the reign of queen Mary,
John, then lord Erskine, obtained leave to
have this question tried a-new, and to have
it determined by an inquest, whether he was
nearest heir to Isabel countess of Marr or not.
And lord Erskine having laid before the in∣quest
the proofs of his propinquity, as above
deduced, and shown, that there was nothing
in the four reasons of reduction, at the in∣stance
of the king, 1457;</P>
<P>1<HI>st,</HI> Because it never was before heard of,
or pretended, that the proof of propinquity
to one's ancestors, by undoubted records, was
<PB N="468" REF="489"/>
not as valid as that by witnesses, which in
many cases, by lapse of time, was rendered
impossible. That if this was to be establish∣ed
as a rule, the king would be found to have
right to one half of the lands of Scotland, as
well as to the earldom of Marr.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>second</HI> reason, the act of
parliament anent the king's keeping possessi∣on
during his minority; that could be no rea∣son
for reducing the service of Robert lord
Erskine to Isabel countess of Marr, but only
for not giving him possession till the king's
majority.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>third</HI> reason, that Isabel
countess of Marr did not die last vested and
saised, but earl Alexander her husband, and
Thomas his natural son; it was of no weight,
because that Alexander was only saised of
that estate in right of liferent, failing issue of
the marriage, as appeared by the charter of
the said countess Isabel, and earl Alexander,
dated 9th December 1404.</P>
<P>And which is confirmed by king Robert's
charter of confirmation, 21st January 1404-5,
by which it undeniably appears, that the
charter of resignation by Isabel countess of
Marr, 12th August 1404, was altered both
by the parties concerned, and their sovereign
lord the king; and therefore the resignation
and charter that followed thereon, 28th May
1426, in favours of the said Alexander, and
Thomas his natural son (who died before him
without issue) was null and void.</P>
<P>That as to the <HI>fourth</HI> reason, that Isabel of
Marr, queen to Robert Bruce, was daughter
to Gratney earl of Marr, and eldest sister to
Elyne, who married sir John Menteith; that
it was well known, that Isabel of Marr, queen
to Robert Bruce, was sister to Gratney earl
of Marr▪ and not his daughter, but daughter
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>∣earl of Marr, his father, which
was fully proved by Gratney earl of Marr
being always stiled, in king Robert's charters,
his brother, but never his father.</P>
<P>The inquest accordingly met, and found
by their retour, dated 5th May 1555, that
he was the nearest heir to Robert earl of Marr
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, lord Erskine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Ro∣bert
was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heir to Isabel countess of
Marr, and to Gratney earl of Marr, her great
grand-father.</P>
<P>And in 1562, he was restored to the earl∣dom
of Marr, <HI>per u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dum justitiae,</HI> which was
ratified in parliament, 4th June 1563.</P>
<P>He obtained a charter under the great
seal, as heir to lady Isabel countess of Marr,
of the whole estate and earldom of Marr,
comprehending Strathdon, Braemarr, Cromarr,
St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and lordship of Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 23d
June 1565.</P>
<P>And there is an instrument of sasine, dated
the 25th of July thereafter.</P>
<P>The lands above-mentioned, having been
all in non-entry from the year 1435, to the
1565, being 130 years.</P>
<P>We have chosen to give the reader the
whole of this remarkable suit at one view,
and shall now return to</P>
<P>Robert, first earl of Marr, of the name of
Erskine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story of the royal family.</NOTE> who married a daughter of Robert
Stewart, lord of Lorn and Innermeath, by
whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Thomas,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir Henry Douglas of
Lochleven.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1453, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>IX. THOMAS, ninth lord Erskine, and se∣cond
earl of Marr of the name of Erskine.</P>
<P>Although this noble lord seems to have
had good reason to be offended with the
court, for denying him in such an extraordi∣nary
manner, what he had a just title to, as
above set forth; yet he was a man of such
honour and integrity, that nothing could shake
his loyalty and affection to his prince: and
we find him in the very year 1457, in which
he was dispossessed of the earldom of Marr,
employed in many negotiations of state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 40<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> and
was then one of the guarantees of a treaty
with the English.</P>
<P>He was also a firm and steady friend of
king James III. and entered into none of the
cabals with the rest of the nobility against
him, but continued stedfast in his loyalty to
him to the very last, notwithstanding the
king had taken from him the castle of Stir∣ling,
which had been enjoyed for many gene∣rations
by his ancestors.</P>
<P>He appears to have been possessed of a vast
estate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. Jacobi III. et archiv. fam. de Marr.</NOTE> by the different charters, under the
great seal, granted to him, of many great ba∣ronies
and other lands, betwixt the 1460
and 1480.</P>
<P>He married lady Janet Douglas, daughter
of James earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Mor∣ton.</NOTE> by lady Jean Stew∣art
his wife, daughter of king James I. and by
her had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir,—and three daugh∣ters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir Alexander Se∣ton
of Touch.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Mary,</HI> married to William Livingston
of Kilsyth.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Muricla,</HI> married to the second earl of
Marishall.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>X. ALEXANDER, tenth lord Erskine, and
<PB N="461" REF="490"/>
third earl of Marr of the Erskine family, who
was always in great favour with king James
IV. having been intrusted with the keeping
of him in his minority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. Jacobi IV. et archiv. fam. de Marr.</NOTE> and was by his maje∣sty
appointed one of his privy council, and
restored to the government of the castle of
Dunbarton.</P>
<P>He got a charter under the great seal, upon
his father's resignation, <HI>Alexandro filio et haere∣di
Thomae domini Erskine,</HI> of the lands and ba∣rony
of Alloa, forestry of Clackmannan, Nis∣bet,
and Dunglass in Roxburgh-shire, Calin-house,
Tulch-Gorme, and Middlestead, in
Stirling-shire, Pittarrow, in Forfar-shire, the
barony of Kelly, in Aberdeen-shire, Balma∣kellie
and Newton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Haddington's collections.</NOTE> in Kincardine-shire, and
one hundred pounds out of the customs of A∣berdeen,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> 12th August 1489.</P>
<P>There are many charters under the great
seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Alexandro domino Erskine,</HI> of baronies
and other lands, betwixt 1490 and 1500.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Christian, daughter of sir
Robert Crichton of Sanquhar, ancestor of the
earl of Dumfries.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Helen, daughter of A∣lexander
first lord Home, widow of Adam,
son and heir of sir Patrick Hepburn lord of
Hailes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Archiv. fam. de Marr.</NOTE> by whom he had three sons, and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Mr. <HI>Alexander Erskine.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Walter Erskine</HI> of Over-Donottars.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Christian,</HI> married to sir
David Stewart of Rosyth.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Agnes,</HI> married to sir William
Menteith of Carse.</P>
<P>He was a most liberal benefactor to the re∣ligious.
He founded and largely indowed a
chaplainry at Alloa,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> for the safety of the
souls of the late king James III. and the pre∣sent
king James, and for the souls of Christi∣an
his late spouse, and Helen Home his pre∣sent,
and all his ancestors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his heirs and suc∣cessors,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He died before the year 1510, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XI. ROBERT, eleventh lord Erskine, and
fourth earl of Marr, who, in his father's life∣time,
<HI>anno</HI> 1506, got a charter under the
great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>Roberto magistro de Erskine, officii

<P>He also appears to have been heretable

<P>There is likeways a charter, <HI>Roberto magi∣stro

1507. After his father's death, he got char∣ters,
under the great seal, of many lands and
baronies, in 1510 and 1511.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir
George Campbell of Loudoun, by whom he
had five sons, and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert,</HI> who died before his father, un∣married.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>3. <HI>James</HI> of Little-Sauchie, ancestor of

of Lawndies.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir James
Forbes of Torwood.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Janet,</HI> married to John Murray
of Touchaddam.</P>
<P>He accompanied king James IV. to the fa∣tal
field of Floudon, where he lost his life,
with his royal master, <HI>anno</HI> 1513.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XII. JOHN, twelfth lord Erskine, and
fifth earl of Marr, who, in the beginning of
the year 1515, was sent to France by the e∣states
of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIII. p. 509.</NOTE> to endeavour to get
Scotland included in their treaty with the
English; and immediately upon his return,
being a man of great abilities, singular probi∣ty
and honour, was intrusted with the keep∣ing
of the young king James V. and was ap∣pointed
governor of Stirling castle, where
the king and he resided; and he acquitted
himself in that great charge so much to his
majesty's satisfaction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hathornden.</NOTE> that he held him in
high esteem ever after.</P>
<P>In the year 1517,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. XIII. p. 60<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> John lord Erskine is
one of the guarantees of a treaty with the En∣glish.</P>
<P>There is a charter 15th May 1525, con∣stituting
John lord Erskine, and his heirs,
captain and constable of the castle of Stirling,
together with the keeping of his majesty's
parks and wards of the same, with apparte∣nances,
and all lands, sees, profits, privileges,
devoirs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Marr.</NOTE> customs, duties, sicklike, and as free∣ly,
as he or any of his ancestors had done
heretofore.</P>
<P>In the year 1534, he was sent ambassador
to the court of England, to negotiate some
matters of the highest importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 540.</NOTE> and con∣cluded
a treaty with that nation to the satis∣faction
of his royal master.</P>
<P>He accompanied king James to France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hathornden, and Stewart's history.</NOTE>
when he went to marry princess Magdalene
de Valois, daughter of Francis I. <HI>anno</HI> 1537.</P>
<P>After the death of James V. 1542, the
keeping of his insant sovereign was commit∣ted
<PB N="462" REF="491"/>
to him. Indeed the care and keeping of
the king's children had been so often given
to this family, that they now claimed it as
their privilege, and actually enjoyed the
same, till such time as king James VI. suc∣ceeded
to the crown of England. He dis∣charged
his duty in that high and difficult trust
of the guardianship of his young sovereign
with the greatest fidelity and prudence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All our histo∣rians.</NOTE> and
though this noble lord was one of those that
inclined to the reformation, then beginning in
Scotland, yet he always steadily and vigorous∣ly
opposed the practices of the court of Eng∣land,
which he thought inconsistent with the
honour and independency of his country, and
showed himself equally incapable of being
moved by English gold, or the threatenings
of a party. Queen Mary remained in his
keeping till the year 1548, when the estates
of the kingdom, to avoid the practices of the
court of England, and of the faction in Scot∣land
that had joined with them, thought pro∣per
to order him to carry the queen to the
court of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> there to be educated under
the eye and care of Francis I. which he ac∣cordingly
did, and delivered her safe into the
hands of that monarch, and immediately re∣turned
home.</P>
<P>By many charters in the public records,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et in archiv. fa∣miliae de Marr.</NOTE>
<HI>inter</HI> 1516 <HI>et</HI> 1540, of the different lands
and baronies he was possest of, he appears to
have had an immense estate.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Campbell, eldest
daughter to Archibald second earl of Argyle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
by whom he had six sons, and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Robert,</HI> master of Erskine, who marri∣ed
lady Margaret Graeme, daughter of Willi∣am
earl of Montrose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes duc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m de Montrose.</NOTE> He got a charter, up∣on
the resignation of his father, under the

Margaret Graeme his spouse, of the lands and
barony of Kelly, in Aberdeen-shire, 20th
May 1536.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XIV. p. 796.</NOTE> He was taken prisoner at Sol∣way-moss,
and ransomed, <HI>anno</HI> 1543. He was
killed at the battle of Pinkie 1547, without
lawful issue; but left a natural son by Mrs.
Jean Home, Mr. David Erskine, commenda∣tor
of Dryburgh, of whom the Erskines of
Seafield are descended.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Thomas,</HI> master of Erskine, a youth of
great hopes. He, when a young man, was
one of the secret council who got the Scots
included in the treaty betwixt England and
France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, tom. XV. p. 255.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1551, and that same year he
was one of the Scotch ambassadors appointed
to treat with the court of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> He mar∣ried
Margaret, daughter of Malcolm lord Fle∣ming,
but died also without lawful issue. He left
a natural son, Adam Erskine, commendator of
Cambuskenneth, who, with his cousin, the
commendator of Dryburgh, and the famous
George Buchanan, were preceptors to king
James VI.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John,</HI> his father's heir.</P>
<P>4. Sir <HI>Alexander Erskine</HI> of Gogar, ance∣stor
of the earls of Kelly, commonly design∣ed
by our historians master of Marr.</P>

<P>2. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> mother to James prior of
St. Andrews, and earl of Murray, by James V.
She afterwards married sir Robert Douglas of
Lochleven, ancestor of the earl of Morton.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1552, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>XIII. JOHN, thirteenth lord Erskine, and
sixth earl of Marr, who was a man of unble∣mished
honour and integrity; and although
he was concerned in every transaction of im∣portance
in this country, from his father's
death till his own, yet he conducted himself
so in those factious unquiet times, that he is
allowed by the historians of both sides to have
been a steady friend to his country, and a
man of as unspotted a character as any person
then upon the stage.</P>
<P>Being born a younger brother, he was e∣ducated
for the church, and was, when very
young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith's bi∣shops.</NOTE> by king James V. appointed commen∣dator
of Cambuskenneth, and Inchmahomo in
Perth-shire.</P>
<P>Immediately after his father's death, he
was appointed governor of the castle of Edin∣burgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In archiv. fa∣miliae de Marr.</NOTE>
which, to the satisfaction of the nati∣on,
he nobly kept against all foreigners, both
French and English. Immediately upon queen
Mary's return from France, <HI>anno</HI> 1561, he
was nominated one of her privy council, and
got from her several grants of church lands,
at that time newly dissolved.</P>
<P>He then likeways, as has been beforemen∣tioned,
renewed his claim to the earldom of
Marr, and obtained liberty to have that cause
re-heard; and his right being clearly and di∣stinctly
proven, he was restored, <HI>per modum
justitiae,</HI> to the earldom of Mair, lordship of
Garrioch, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1562. The same was af∣terwards
ratified and confirmed by parliament,
4th June 1563, as before observed. He took
his seat accordingly as earl of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rolls of par∣liament.</NOTE> and he
and his successors have always since protested,
that they ought to be called as the first earl.</P>
<P>There is a charter from queen Mary and
king Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In archiv. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Marr.</NOTE> to John earl of Marr, 18th Ju∣ly
1566, narrating, that the family of Erskine
of long and bygone times had the custody and
<PB N="463" REF="492"/>
keeping of the principal forts and places of
strength in the kingdom, and had always dis∣charged
their trust faithfully and stoutly;
and their majesties being desirous to keep no∣ble,
antient, and untainted families in their
native lands, rights, and possessions, and to
make them secure of the same; and particu∣larly
considering, that John earl of Marr,
and his predecessors, had, for a long time by∣gone,
been keepers of the castle of Stirling,
and sheriffs of the shire thereof; therefore
they gave and granted, heretably and irre∣deemably,
to the said earl of Marr, and his
heirs, bearing the arms and sirname of Er∣skine,
the office of sheriff of Stirling-shire, or
the prefecture or captainship, and custody of
the castle of Stirling, with the park, garden,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> together with the office of bailiary
and chamberlainry of the lands and lordship of
Stirling, and of the water of Forth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1566, how soon king James
VI. was born, the care and keeping of him
was committed to the earl of Marr, which
great trust he faithfully discharged, and with
great prudence and firmness, took all imagin∣able
care of his royal education, and to pro∣tect
his sacred person from the violence and
snares of the two contending parties, who left
no means whatsoever untried of getting him
into their hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's me∣moirs, and all our histo∣rians.</NOTE> For this reason he remov∣ed
the king from Edinburgh to Stirling,
where he was governor, and had the sole
command. Although he always behaved with
the utmost submission to the queen, and had
the greatest regard for her majesty, yet the
unhappy situation of his country at that time
forced him to concur with those who set the
crown on the prince's head, <HI>anno</HI> 1567. And
as he appears not to have been satisfied with
the intentions of either of the parties, nor
with their method of pursuing them, he de∣clined
being engaged on either side, further
than the preservation of the king's person,
and the liberties of his country made it abso∣lutely
necessary for him to be. And altho',
when the factions came to blows, he general∣ly
joined and supported the party that called
themselves the king's, yet as he plainly show∣ed
that he thought them too much guided
and influenced by the court of England, it is
certain they never let him into any of their
secrets.</P>
<P>When the earl of Lennox, the regent,
was surprized, and killed in the town of Stir∣ling,
he, by the timely assistance he brought
to the king's party, prevented the whole heads
of it from being cut off or made prisoners:
and when a new regent was to be chosen, the
confidence that the nation in general had in
the earl of Marr's integrity and moderation,
forced the king's party to consent to his be∣ing
made regent, notwithstanding all the
practices used by queen Elizabeth and her
ambassadors to prevent it.</P>
<P>So soon as he was in possession of that
high office, he applied himself vigorously to
allay, as far as possible, the factions which tore
his country in pieces, and to free it from the
influence of English councils. In order to
these things he had accomodated matters with
Kirkcaldie of Grange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and others who were
in possession of the castle of Edinburgh, and
persuaded them to join and co-operate with
him, to bring about peace and tranquillity,
thing so much to be wished for: but just
when he was on the point of bringing these
good purposes to bear, he, to the great mis∣fortune
of his country, died a young man, in
November 1572; as some say, not without
the suspicion of poison.</P>
<P>He married Annabella Murray, daughter of
lord Tullibardine, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Archibald earl
of Angus.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN, fourteenth lord Erskine, and
seventh earl of Marr, who was very young at
the time of his father's death, and was edu∣cated
in the castle of Stirling, along with
king James VI. whom the states of the king∣dom,
after the death of lord Marr, commit∣ted
to the care of his widow the countess of
Marr; and though this earl had been edu∣cated
with king James, yet he, in his young∣er
days, was so far seduced by some others of
the nobility, as to forget himself, and the un∣blemished
loyalty of his ancestors, and to join
with them in surprizing the king at Ruth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en,
<HI>anno</HI> 1582, for which his whole lands were
justly seized, and he obliged to fly the coun∣try:
however, he soon became sensible of the
crime he had committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣mil. de Marr.</NOTE> and the king was so
gracious as to pardon him, restore to him his
whole estate, and receive him again into his
favour.</P>
<P>In the year 1595, the king intrusted the
keeping of his new born son and heir, as usu∣al,
to the earl of Marr, with a strict order
to him not to deliver him up to any person
whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> without a written mandate under
his own hand; and, in case of his death, not
to deliver him to any person whatsomever,
neither to the queen his mother, nor even to
the parliament, if they required it, till he was
eighteen years of age, then he would com∣mand
himself.</P>
<P>Lord Marr was naturally a man of great
abilities, and being bred from his infancy in
<PB N="464" REF="493"/>
the factious court of king James VI. he be∣came
an able statesman. He was the person
the king chose to send to England, to con∣gratulate
queen Elizabeth upon the suppressi∣on
of the attempt of the earl of Essex.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil, &amp; all our historians.</NOTE> And
it is acknowledged, he entered into some se∣cret
negotiations and measures for securing
the king's succession to the crown of England.
He was accompanied by the abbot of Kinloss,
and matters were managed with such dexteri∣ty
and address, that most of the queen's mi∣nisters
and great men of England, entered in∣to
engagements, unknown to her majesty, and
to one another, to support king James's title
to the crown of England.</P>
<P>When king James went to England, <HI>anno</HI>
1603, he carried lord Marr along with him;
but before he came to York, lord Marr was
obliged to return to Scotland to appease queen
Anne, who had demanded her daughter prin∣cess
Elizabeth, and her son prince Charles,
whom lord Marr had left under the care of
his countess, with express command, not to
deliver them to any person whatever, with∣out
an order under his hand. It is said, that
the queen never forgave him this,</P>
<P>However, immediately thereafter he fol∣lowed
the king to England, and so soon as he
got to London he was appointed a privy coun∣cillor
of that kingdom, and was enstalled one
of the knights of the garter at Windsor 1603.</P>
<P>He continued much at court, and greatly
in the king's favour, for the first eight or ten
years after he went to England, who entrust∣ed
and confided much in him with regard to
the management of foreign affairs, and he was
said to be at the head of the French saction,
as it was then called.</P>
<P>On the 3d of February 1620, he obtained
a charter, upon his own resignation, of the
earldom of Marr, lordship of Strathdon, and
Strathdee, of Garrioch, and Alloa, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> toge∣ther
with the heretable offices of captainship
of the castle of Stirling, and sheriff of the
shire thereof, chamberlainry of the lordship of
Stirling, Menteith, Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chin, and Navarre,
bailiary and admiralty of the water of Forth,
to him and his heirs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv is fam. de Marr, et in pub. archi∣vis.</NOTE> This charter has a <HI>de

offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> contained therein, into one whole
and free earldom of Marr, and declares infeft∣ment,
taken at the tower or castle of Alloa,
shall be sufficient for the whole.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of Henry prince of
Wales, whose education he had had the care
of, he left the court, and returned to Scot∣land,
where he was made lord high treasurer,
in which office he continued till the 1631,
that he resigned it, and retired to the coun∣try
from all public business.</P>
<P>It does not appear that he received from
his royal master any gratuities in England,
but he was most bountiful to him in his
grants of lands in Scotland; by which, and
his paternal possessions, he became possest of
one of the greatest estates of any person in
this kingdom.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Anne, daughter of David
lord Drummond, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Mary Stewart,
daughter of Esme, and sister of Ludovick
duke of Lennox, by whom he had seven sons
and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> earl of Buchan.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Henry,</HI> lord Cardross, ancestor of the
present earl of Buchan, (<HI>vide</HI> p. 97th of this
work.) Lord Marr, having in 1604 obtained
the peerage of Cardross, with power to as∣sign
it to any of his sons he thought proper,
he accordingly disponed it to his son Henry,
who, in consequence thereof, sat as lord Car∣dross
in the parliament of Scotland even dur∣ing
his father's life.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>Alexander Erskine,</HI> one of the se∣nators
of the college of justice, who was blown
up in Dunglass house, <HI>anno</HI> 1640, without is∣sue.</P>
<P>4. Sir <HI>Charles Erskine</HI> of Alva, of whom
the present sir Harry Erskine, the late Charles
Erskine of Tinwald lord justice-clerk, his
son lord Barjarg, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are descended.</P>
<P>5. Sir <HI>John Erskine</HI> of Otterstown.</P>
<P>6. Sir <HI>Arthur Erskine</HI> of Scotscraig.</P>
<P>7. <HI>William Erskine,</HI> cup-bearer to king
Charles II. and master of the charter-house at
London.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married, 1st, to
William sixth earl marishal, and had issue;
2dly, to Patrick earl of Panmure; but to
him she had no issue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to John earl of
Rothes, and by him was mother of John
duke of Rothes.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John earl
of Kinghorn, ancestor of the earl of Strath∣more,
without issue.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Katharine,</HI> married to Thomas
second earl of Hadmton, and had issue.</P>
<P>John earl of Marr died in an advanced
age in the year 1634, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>XV. JOHN, fifteenth lord Erskine, and
eighth earl of Marr, who was a man of learn∣ing,
and a great projector, whereby he spent
a considerable part of his estate.</P>
<P>He was made one of the knights of the
bath, at the coronation of Henry prince of
Wales, <HI>anno</HI> 1610.</P>
<P><PB N="465" REF="494"/>
He was appointed one of his majesty's pri∣vy
council in Scotland, one of the senators of
the college of justice, and governor of the
castle of Edinburgh, <HI>anno</HI> 1615.</P>
<P>He continued a lord of session till the year
1626.</P>
<P>He was removed from being governor of
the castle of Edinburgh <HI>anno</HI> 1638, and ge∣neral
Ruthven put in his place.</P>
<P>In the same year, king Charles having
formed the design of purchasing all the here∣table
jurisdictions, prevailed with lord Marr,
to enter into a minute with him, obliging
himself to sell to his majesty the heretable
sheriff-ship of Stirling-shire, and the bailiary
of the water of Forth, for the sum of eight
thousand pound sterling; dated at Whitehall,
15th February 1638. And accordingly the
earl resigned these two offices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Marr.</NOTE> 4th November
1641, and of the same date, gets a bond for
the eight thousand pound.</P>
<P>Upon the first breaking out of the great
rebellion in king Charles the I.'s time, he
appears to have inclined to join with the co∣venanters,
and was by them appointed a privy
councillor for life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1641; but so soon as
he discovered their true intention, he openly
deserted them, joined the loyal party, and
continued to act steadily with them as long
as he lived; and on that account, he had
his estate sequestrated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me∣moirs.</NOTE> and suffered many other
hardships.</P>
<P>He sold many of his lands in Scotland, and
purchased a large estate in Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Marr.</NOTE> which he
and his family totally lost in the Irish rebellion.</P>
<P>He married lady Christian Hay, daughter of
Francis ninth earl of Errol, by whom he had
three sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Francis Erskine.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>William Erskine.</HI></P>
<P>The last two died without issue.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to
Archibald second lord Napier, to whom she
had two sons and three daughters.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Mary Erskine,</HI> who died unmar∣ried.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1654, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>XVI. JOHN, sixteenth lord Erskine, and
ninth earl of Marr, who, in his father's life∣time,
got charters under the great seal, <HI>Jo∣hanni
domino Erskine, totius comitatus de Marr,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> This is instructed by several char∣ters
in the public register, between the years
1640 and 1642</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and merit,
and invariably attached to the interest of his
king and country.</P>
<P>He was much courted by the covenanters
and their party, to accept of a command in
their army: But, upon his absolute refusal to
have any connection with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's me∣moirs, p. 60. and 70.</NOTE> the command
designed for him in their army, together with
the Stirling-shire regiment, was given to lord
Livingston.</P>
<P>He having joined with the marquis of
Montrose, the parliament ordered his houses
of Erskine and Alloa to be plundered.</P>
<P>After the battle of Kilsyth, he advertised
the marquis of Montrose of general Lesly's
advancing against him, and warned him of
the danger he was in.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthry's memoirs.</NOTE> But this could not
prevent the fatal battle of Philiphaugh, from
whence he, (then only lord Erskine) with
great difficulty, made his escape to his father's
estate in Marr, where he raised some of the
friends and vassals of his family for his ma∣jesty's
service. For these, and his other loy∣al
actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE> the parliament fined him in 24,000
merks, to be disposed of by general Lesly's
advice, <HI>anno</HI> 1645.</P>
<P>After his father's death, he had several fines
imposed upon him, though his whole estate
was sequestrated, and continued so till the re∣storation;
during which time, he lived pri∣vately
in a little cottage at the gate of his
house of Alloa.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the restoration, he got charters un∣der
the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> from king Charles II.
<HI>Johanni comiti de Marr,</HI> of many lands and
baronies, <HI>inter</HI> 1662 <HI>et</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>He married,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Buc∣cleuch.</NOTE> 1st, lady Mary Scot, daugh∣ter
of Walter earl of Buccleugh, by whom
he had no surviving issue.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Mary MacKenzie,
daughter of George earl of Seaforth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Seaforth.</NOTE> by
whom he had two sons and three daughters,</P>
<P>1. <HI>Charles,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>George,</HI> who died young.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Barbara,</HI> married to

<P>2. lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to John eleventh
earl of Glencairn.</P>
<P>3. lady <HI>Sophia,</HI> married to Alexander lord
Pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igo. They all had issue.</P>
<P>He died, <HI>anno</HI> 1664, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XVII. CHARLES, seventeenth lord Er∣skine,
and tenth earl of Marr, who, tho' he
died a young man, yet, he showed himself,
while he lived, worthy of his ancestors, and
strongly attached to the interest of his country.</P>
<P>King Charles the II. appointed him one of
the lords of his privy council, <HI>anno</HI> 1682.</P>
<P>About the same time, he raised a regiment
of foot upon his own expences for his maje∣sty's
service, which has since been known by
<PB N="466" REF="495"/>
the name of the Scotch Fuzileers; and he
continued colonel of this regiment till he died.</P>
<P>The great debts his grandfather and father
had been obliged to contract, during the time
of the grand rebellion, obliged him to sell a
great part of his estate; and, among other
lands, the lordship of Erskine, which had
never before been out of the family, and
which is now possest by the lord Blantyre.</P>
<P>Although he was one of king James VII.'s
privy councillors, yet he was far from approving
of the measures followed in the latter end of
that reign, and had actually left his house in
order to retire and live privately abroad,
when the news of king William's landing
came to Scotland.</P>
<P>He joined the convention of estates, and
raised a large body of his vassals and follow∣ers
in support thereof; but dyed very soon
thereafter.</P>
<P>He married lady Mary Maule, daughter of
George earl of Panmure, by whom he had
eight sons, and one daughter. Two of his
sons were named Charles, two of them George,
and one by the name of Francis, who all died
young.</P>
<P>The surviving sons were,</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Erskine</HI> of Grange, a man of ex∣traordinary
abilities, who, being bred to the
law, became so eminent in that profession,
when very young, that he was by her maje∣sty
queen Anne, appointed one of the se∣nators
of the college of justice, <HI>anno</HI> 1706,
and thereafter lord justice-clerk; in which
offices he had many opportunities of display∣ing
the great talents he was possessed of.</P>
<P>3. Colonel <HI>Henry Erskine,</HI> a young man
of a great military genius, who was unfortu∣nately
killed at the battle of Almanza in Spain,
<HI>anno</HI> 1707.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to sir
Hugh Paterson of Bannockburn, and had is∣sue.</P>
<P>He died in the slower of his age, in 1689,
and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XVIII. JOHN, eighteenth lord Erskine,
and eleventh earl of Marr, who was a man of
the most shining parts, and greatest capacity,
of most men in the age he lived in.</P>
<P>He was very young when his father died,
and, upon his becoming of age, was appointed
one of the lords of the privy council in Scot∣land,
had the command of a regiment of foot,
and was made knight of the most noble order
of St. Andrew.</P>
<P>In the year 1705, he was made one of the
principal secretaries of state for Scotland, and,
the year following, was appointed one of the
commissioners for the treaty of union betwixt
the two nations. He joined and concurred
heartily with others of the Scotch nobility,
who at last brought that great affair to a con∣clusion,
notwithstanding the great opposition
it met with from several other Scotch lords,
whose spirited protests are still preserved in the
records of that parliament.</P>
<P>He was elected one of the sixteen peers
for Scotland, to the four first British parlia∣ments,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the years 1707, 1708, 1710,
and 1713.</P>
<P>In the year 1708, he was appointed one
of the lords of the privy council, and was al∣ways
in the greatest favour with his royal
mistress queen Anne, who was thought to
confide in him more than in most men, with
regard to her most secret councils and affairs
of state.</P>
<P>And in the year 1712, she again appoint∣ed
him one of the principal secretaries of
state.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of king George the I. he
was deprived of all his offices, and, in the year
1715, he retired to his estate in the North
of Scotland, where he, unhappily for his coun∣try
and himself, raised a rebellion, and pro∣claimed
the pretender at Kirkmichael in
Perth-shire, on the 11th of September that
year; and being joined by several of the dis∣affected
nobility and gentry, he got together
about 6 or 7000 men, most of them unarm∣ed,
and all undisciplined, who rendesvouzed
at Perth about the beginning of November,
from whence they marched to Sheriff-muir,
near Dumblane, where, on the 13th of that
month, being met by the king's army, com∣manded
by John duke of Argyle, inferior in
numbers, but superior in regularity and dis∣cipline,
a smart engagement ensued, in which
a good deal of blood was shed on both sides.
The earl of Marr behaved like a brave officer,
having his horse shot under him, and showing
every token of spirit and gallantry, but neither
of the generals could claim the victory, the
duke retiring to Stirling, and the earl to Perth:
however, it had all the effect of a victory to
the government, for the earl of Marr was
never, after his retreat to Perth, able again
to bring the rebels forces together, but was
obliged to make his escape beyond seas, and
in the year 1716, was attainted of high trea∣son,
along with the duke of Ormond and lord
Bolingbroke, and their honours and estates
were forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>This unhappy lord, after his going abroad,
followed the pretender to Rome, and remain∣ed
in his service till the year 1721. He
then went to Paris, and continued there
till 1729; when, on the account of his bad
<PB N="467" REF="496"/>
state of health, he was obliged to go to Aix la
Chapelle, where he continued till his death,
Which happened in May 1732.</P>
<P>His estate was sold by the commissioners of
enquiry into the forfeited estates, and bought
by the earl's brother, the said Mr. Erskine of
Grange, for the benefit of his nephew lord Er∣skine,
to whom Mr. Erskine conveyed the
same, <HI>anno</HI> 1739.</P>
<P>This earl married, 1st, lady Margaret Hay,
daughter of Thomas earl of Kinnoul, by whom
he had two sons,</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> who died an infant.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Thomas,</HI> now lord Erskine.</P>
<P>He married 2dly, lady Frances Pierpont,
daughter of Evelyn duke of Kingston, in
England, by whom he had one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Frances Erskine,</HI> on whom king
George the I. was graciously pleased to settle,
out of her father's estate, the same fortune she
was intitled to by her mother's marriage-set∣tlement.</P>
<P>His majesty was likewise pleased to give
the countess of Marr, from the time of her
husband's attainder, the same jointure she was
intitled to by her marriage-settlements in case
of his death.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Frances Erskine,</HI> married her cousin
James Erskine, son of her uncle Mr. Erskine
of Grange, and has issue two sons, John-Fran∣cis,
and James-Francis Erskines, both officers
in the British service.</P>
<P>XIX. THOMAS lord Erskine, only son of
John late earl of Marr, is in possession of his
estate in the manner above-mentioned: and,
had it not been for his father's attainder,
would have been the thirteenth earl of Marr
of this family, and nineteenth lord Erskine, in
a direct line from father to son.</P>
<P>He married lady Charlotte Hope, daughter
of Charles earl of Hopeton.</P>

<P>THE immediate ancestor of this noble

generation of that illustrious house, in a di∣rect

daughter of George marquis of Huntly,
by whom he had two sons, and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> fourth earl of Perth, lord high

<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> afterwards earl of Melfort.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to John
earl of Errol, lord high constable of Scotland,
and had issue.</P>
<P>I. JOHN, second son of James third earl
of Perth, being a man of great parts, both
natural and acquired, made a considerable fi∣gure
in his time, and married, 1st, Sophia,
sole heiress and representative of the most an∣tient
family of Lundin of that ilk, in the
county of Fife, whose issue by her will be
mentioned under the title of Drummond earl
of Perth.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Eupheme, daughter of
sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, baronet,
lord justice-clerk. To the issue of this mar∣riage
only was the peerage granted, and they
were the only sufferers by the attainder.</P>
<P>Mr. Drummond was in great favour with
king Charles II. who, in 1680, made him
general of the ordnance, and deputy gover∣nor
of Edinburgh castle.</P>
<P>In 1682, when the duke of Queensberry

<P>THE sirname of Melvile is of great anti∣quity
in this country. The traditional
accounts of the family are, that a man of con∣siderable
rank of that sirname accompanied
queen Margaret from Hungary to Scotland,
obtained a grant of some lands in Mid-lothian
from king Malcolm Canmore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leslie, Mac-Kenzie, Mar∣tin, &amp;c.</NOTE> where he set∣tled,
called his mansion-house Castle Melvile,
and was progenitor of all the Melviles in Scot∣land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction to Fordun's history. p. 60.</NOTE>
Others are of opinion, that they came
originally from France.</P>
<P>It appears from our records, that the Melviles
were numerous, and made a figure in Scotland
soon after the reign of king Malcolm Canmore.</P>

<P>He was afterwards suspected, tho' it is said
most unjustly, of having had a correspondence
with the enemies of his country in England,
and being a great promoter of the reformati∣on,
he became very obnoxious to the catholic
clergy.</P>
<P>His son was then in England, either for his
education or travelling. A letter from him

sent prisoner to Stirling castle, accused and

the privy council by queen Mary, <HI>anno</HI> 1562.</P>
<P>When king James VI. took the manage∣ment

this Robert, with the master of Grange, to
the court of England, to interceed with queen

is acknowledged by all our historians, that he
acted the part of an intrepid and faithful

<P>What part he acted during the rebellion,

<P>THE sirname of Middleton is of great an∣tiquity,

<P>Their immediate ancestor was,</P>
<P>I. KENNETH, who lived in the reigns of
king Malcolm IV. and king William who
succeeded Malcolm, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>

<P>This Malcolm assumed the sirname of Mid∣dleton
from his lands, and from him all the

<P>This John, who made so great a figure in
this country, was a man of good parts, and
bred a scholar; but upon the breaking out of
the civil war, he betook himself to arms,
which seemed to suit his genius better.</P>
<P>He first engaged in the service of the par∣liament
of England, where he so remarkably
distinguished himself by his courage and mili∣tary
capacity, that he soon got the command
of a troop of horse, and sir William Waller
thereafter made him a lieutenant-general.</P>
<P>After the earl of Essex was cashiered, he
returned to Scotland, and when the army was
raised to rescue the king (then a prisoner in
the isle of Wight) he was appointed lieute∣nant-general
of the horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> his commission be∣ing

<P>After this period he became a loyal subject,
continued a steady and firm friend of the roy∣al
family, performed many brave actions in
their service, was excepted from pardon by O∣liver
Cromwel, and none suffered greater
hardships during the usurpation than general
Middleton; but he lived to see the restora∣tion,
and soon received from his majesty king
Charles II. the rewards of his faithful services.</P>
<P>He was raised to the dignity of the peer∣age
by the titles of earl of Middleton, lord
Clermont and Fettercairn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> by patent, <HI>Johan∣ni

<P>On the 12th of that month, he was made
governor of the castle of Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> and was
made his majesty's high commissioner to the
parliament of Scotland, on the 29th of No∣vember

<P>He was made general of all the forces in

<P>Sometime thereafter, upon some disgust he
had given the ministry, he was divested of all
his public employments; but his majesty ap∣pointed
him governor of the new English fort
at Tangier in Africa, where he continued as
long as he lived.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Grizel, daughter of—

being a man of parts, and bred at the court of

<P>He was appointed envoy extraordinary to
the emperor of Germany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> where he acquitted
himself so much to his majesty's satisfaction,
that immediately upon his return, he was made

<P>He was sworn one of his majesty's privy

<HEAD>GRAHAM Duke of MONTROSE.</HEAD>
<P>NO sirname in Scotland claims a higher
origin than the Graham.</P>
<P>The traditional account thereof, handed
down to us by our historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. Aber∣crombie, p. 549, v. I. &amp;c.</NOTE> is, that they
are descended of the renowned Graeme, who,
in the year 404, was general of king Fergus
II's. army, and was governor of Scotland in
the minority of his grandchild king Eugene
II. fought with the Romans, defeated the Bri∣tons,
and in the 420, made a breach in,
and forced that mighty wall which the em∣peror
Severus had reared up between the
rivers Forth and Clyde, as the utmost limits
of the Roman empire, to keep out the Scots
from molesting them in their possessions;
which wall has ever since retained, and to
this day goes under the name of Graeme's
Dyke.</P>
<P>The foundation of this great rampart has
been of late traced from the one river to the
other, and is fully instructed by several stones
found therein, which have Roman inscripti∣ons
cut out upon them, denoting the limits
where, and by whom they were set, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A
good many of these stones are at present to
be seen in the college of Glasgow, and are
well described in Mr. Gordon's <HI>Itinerarium
septentrionale.</HI></P>
<P>This great man is said to have married a
lady of the royal house of Denmark, and was
progenitor of all the Grahams in the kingdom
of Scotland.</P>
<P>We shall, however, insist no further on
these traditional accounts, but directly pro∣ceed
to deduce the descent of this illustrious
and antient family by authentick documents
from,</P>
<P>I. WILLIAM de GRAEME. He flourished in
the reign of king David I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foundation charter▪ print∣ed in the ap∣pendix to Ri∣chard Hay's vindication of Elizab. More, p. 127.</NOTE> who succeeded to
the crown of Scotland in 1124, and founded
the abbacy of Holyroodhouse, in the year
1128, to which<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his William de Graeme is a
witness.</P>
<P>He appears to have been much about king
David's court, being witness to many of that
good prince's donations to the religious; and,
according to sir James Dalrymple, was propri∣etor
of several lands in Mid-Lothian, which
also appears from the chartulary of St. An∣drews.</P>

<HI>Willielmus de Graeme</HI> is a witness,

to the priory of St. Andrews, the same Willi∣am

<P>He was father of,</P>

the reigns of king Malcolm IV. and king Wil∣liam
the Lyon; which last succeeded king
Malcolm <HI>anno</HI> 1165, and died in 1214.</P>

The confirmation has no date, but appears to
have been about the year 1170.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P>III. WILLIAM de GRAEME, who succeed∣ed
him. In a charter of Alexander de Setun
to Adam de Polisworth, of the lands of Beeth,
in marriage with his sister Emma, confirmed

William de Graeme, David, son of earl Hen∣ry,
John de Methkill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are witnesses.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir DAVID de GRAEME, the undoubt∣ed
progenitor of the most noble family of
Montrose.</P>
<P>He obtained from king William, a grant of
the lands of Charleton and Barrowfield, near
Montrose; also the lordship of Kinnebber,
<HI>cum dominiis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE> <HI>tenendriis, et thanagiis ejusdem,

has no date, but must have been granted in,
or before 1214, being the year in which king
William died.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of king A∣lexander II.
who succeeded king William, he
got a charter from Henry de Graeme, (where∣in

the lands of Clifton and Clifton-hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in Mid∣Lothian;
the superiority whereof remains
<PB N="479" REF="510"/>

<P>This Henry de Graeme being a near relation
of sir David, they are undoubtedly descend∣ed
of the same stock; and as Henry was pro∣genitor
of the Graemes of Abercorn, who
made a considerable figure in this country
for several generations, we shall here give a
brief account of that family.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Petrus de Graeme,</HI> who lived in the
reign of king Malcolm IV. was probably a
younger son or nephew of the first William,
and left issue two sons. 1. Henry, his heir.

<P>Petrus was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>

<P>He married the daughter and heiress of

<P>He died in the beginning of the reign of

<P>He left issue a son,</P>

and confirmed the donations made by his pre∣decessors
to the monks of Melross, in these
words: <HI>Johannes de Graham de Eskdale, mi∣les,

<P>This sir John had no surviving male-issue,
but he had a daughter,</P>
<P>6. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William Douglas,
lord of Liddisdale, of the family of Morton,
called the flower of chivalry, one of the

the lands and lordship of Dalkeith, which was
enjoyed by, and continued to be one of the
chief titles of, the family of Morton above
three hundred years. <HI>Vide</HI> title earl of Mor∣ton,

<P>Though we can trace the male line of this

the constant companion and bosom friend
of the brave sir William Wallace, governor of
Scotland, who, with him, shared the glory of
all the illustrious victories that were then
obtained by the Scots over the common ene∣mies

king Edward I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. III.</NOTE></P>
<P>He afterwards, in reward of his constant

<P>3. Sir <HI>William Graham</HI> of Braco.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Lilias,</HI> married to John
earl of Wigton.</P>
<P>He died in November 1608, in the 61st
year of his age, and was succeeded by his el∣dest
son,</P>
<P>XIX. JOHN, fourth earl of Montrose, who
got charters under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Johanni co∣miti
de Montrose,</HI> of many lands, <HI>inter</HI> 1609
<HI>et</HI> 1620.</P>
<P>He was also a man of parts, and much e∣steemed
by king Charles I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> who, immediately
upon his accession to the crown, constituted
him president of the council.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Ruthven, daugh∣ter
of William earl of Gowrie, by whom he
had a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> afterwards marquis of Montrose,
—and four daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Lilias,</HI> married to sir John Col∣quhoun

<P>2. Lady <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Archibald
lord Napier.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Dorothea,</HI> married to James first
lord Rollo.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Beatrix,</HI> married to David lord
Maderty.</P>
<P>He died in November 1626, and was suc∣ceeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XX. JAMES, fifth earl of Montrose, born
in 1612, whose education was suitable to his
high birth. He was possessed of many emi∣nent
qualities, with an uncommon military
genius, which he nobly exerted in the service
of his king and country.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he was at first engaged on the covenanters
side; but no sooner did he perceive their in∣tentions,
and the measures they were pursuing,
than he deserted their party, went over to the
king's service, was created marquis of Mon∣trose
on 16th May 1644, and continued stea∣dy
and unalterable in the interest of the royal
family to the end of his life.</P>
<P>The many great actions he performed, and
the glorious victories he obtained with hand∣fuls
of loyalists against the numerous forces of
their enemies, <HI>viz.</HI> at Tippermuir, Alfurd, A∣berdeen,
Inverlochy, Kilsyth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will scarce
be believed by after-ages; and as they are all
narrated in the life of that great man, written
by doctor Wishart, who was an eye-witness,
to that we must refer our readers, as it is in∣consistent
with the brevity of this work to be
more particular.</P>
<P>However, we must here, for the sake of
truth, vindicate him of one aspersion which
hath been most unjustly cast upon him by
some authors, who have alledged, that he ac∣tually
took the solemn league and covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE>
consequently was guilty of the breach of that
oath: but this is absolutely false; for in Oc∣tober
1643, he was summoned to appear be∣fore
the parliament to take that solemn league,
betwixt and the beginning of January then
next: but at that time he was with the king,
so did not appear.</P>
<P>Upon the 12th of January 1644, there
was a decreet of parliament pronounced against
him for not complying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> upon which he was
outlawed, forfeited, and his estate ordered to
be sequestrate.</P>
<P>He was afterwards intercommuned under
the designation of James Graham, sometime
<PB N="485" REF="516"/>
earl of montrose, for being in rebellion a∣gainst
God and his covenant; and all his ma∣jesty's
good subjects were discharged to reset
or give him the least supply, under the pain
of treason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> this was enacted on 20th March
1646, in which year he was surprised by ge∣neral
Lesly, and the parliament's forces, at
Philiphaugh, and his army routed and dispers∣ed.</P>
<P>He was at last taken prisoner, himself
brought up to Edinburgh, where he suffered
all the indignities of a common malefactor
with the utmost constancy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Wish∣art, &amp;c.</NOTE> a very few days
thereafter he was tried, condemned, and exe∣cuted,
in the most cruel manuer, on 21st May
1650: the firmness, resolution, and mag∣nanimity,
with which he behaved at his trial
and execution, were inimitable. We shall
sum up his character in the words of a noble
author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Claren∣don.</NOTE> who was far from being partial in his
favour, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"He gave as great testimonies
of loyalty and courage as a subject could do,
and performed as wonderful actions in se∣veral
battles, upon as great inequality of
numbers, and as great disadvantages in re∣spect
of arms and other preparations for
war, as have been performed in this age,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q> His body was interred at the
place of execution, where it rested till the re∣storation
of king Charles II. who gave orders
to have the scattered remains raised, and col∣lected
together, and by his majesty's appoint∣ment
were interred with great funeral pomp,
in the isle of the cathederal church of St.
Giles, which belonged to his family, on 14th
May 1661.</P>
<P>He married lady Magdalen Carnegie, daugh∣ter
of David earl of Southesk, by whom he
had one son,</P>
<P>XXI. JAMES, second marquis of Montrose.
Though he was too young to be engaged in
the wars with his worthy father, and lived a
retired life during the usurpation, yet he gave
many instances of his being a man of staunch
loyalty, great probity and honour.</P>
<P>Immediately after the restoration of king
Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawsurd's peerage.</NOTE> his father's forfeiture was repeal∣ed,
he was restored to the whole estates of
the family, and appointed one of his majesty's
most honourable privy council.</P>
<P>He married lady Isabel Douglas, daughter
of William earl of Morton, widow of Robert
first earl of Roxburgh, by whom he had two
sons, and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1669, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XXII. JAMES, third marquis of Mon∣trose,
who, being young at his father's death,
was carefully educated under the particular
inspection of his majesty, and was a man of
fine accomplishments, both natural and ac∣quired.</P>
<P>The king made him a captain of the guards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. &amp; charta penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE>
president of the privy council, sheriff of Dun∣barton,
bailie of the regality of Lennox, Glas∣gow,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He died in the flower of his age, great∣ly
regreted, <HI>anno</HI> 1684; and by lady Chri∣stian
Lesly, his wife, daughter of John duke
of Rothes, left issue an only son,</P>

was a man of distinguished parts and good

with her majesty queen Anne, who, as

high admiral of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1705, and pre∣sident
of the council in 1706.</P>
<P>And in regard of his inviolable attachment
and zeal for the protestant succession, and his
hearty concurrence in the union of the two
kingdoms, her majesty was pleased further to
dignify him by the titles of duke of Mon∣trose,

<P>He was appointed lord privy seal, in the
room of the duke of Queensberry, in 1709;
but was removed from all his offices in 1713,
for declining to comply with the measures of
the court.</P>
<P>Upon the death of her majesty queen Anne,
being at his seat in the country, he made a
speedy journey to Edinburgh, and assisted at
the proclamation of his majesty king George

<P>3. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to James Dou∣glas,
brother of David earl of Angus, who af∣terwards
came to be earl of Morton, and re∣gent
of Scotland.</P>
<P>This earl, having no male-issue, made a re∣signation
and entail of his estate and honours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Morton.</NOTE>
in favours of his cousin sir Robert Douglas of

Douglas, who accordingly succeeded to, the
earldom of Morton, <HI>anno</HI> 1553.</P>
<P>The life and transactions of this James,
who was regent of Scotland, being fully set
forth in the lives of the officers of state, page
94th, <HI>et infra,</HI> to that we refer our readers,
as the brevity of this work will not permit us
to give a particular detail of them.</P>
<P>We shall only observe, that James the re∣gent,
having no lawful issue, made an entail of
the estate and honours of Morton in favours
of his nephew, Archibald earl of Angus, and
the heirs-male of his body; which failing, to
sir William Douglas of Lochleven, son and
heir of the foresaid sir Robert, <HI>anno</HI> 1567.</P>
<P>Upon the death and forfeiture of the re∣gent,
<HI>anno</HI> 1581, John lord Maxwell, grand∣son
of James third earl of Morton, by lady
Beatrix his second daughter, took upon him
the title of earl of Morton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and obtained a

afterwards laid aside that title.</P>
<P>The king having taken the management of
public affairs upon himself, was graciously pleas∣ed
to pass a general act of indemnity, <HI>anno</HI>
1585.</P>
<P>The earl of Morton's forfeiture was then
reversed, upon which Archibald earl of Angus
assumed also the titles of Morton, in virtue of
the regent's destination and entail before-mentioned;
but he likeways dying without
issue in 1588, the estate and honours of Mor∣ton
devolved upon sir William Douglas of
Lochleven, as having undoubted right both
by the last mentioned deed of James the re∣gent,
and the other resignation and entail of
James third earl of Morton, in favours of his
father sir Robert of Lochleven, ratified under
the great seal of king James V. <HI>anno</HI> 1540,
before observed.</P>
<P>James, third and last earl of Morton, of
the house of Dalkeith, descended in a direct
line from the first son of sir John Douglas and
Agnes Monsode, dying without male issue,
the estate and honours of Morton devolved
upon the land of Lochleven, lineally descend∣ed
of Henry, third son of the said sir John (the
second son, William having left no succession)
to whom we now return.</P>

<P>It is proper here to observe, that though it
has been said by some authors, that these sons
were born before their father and mother
were married, consequently not lawful, yet it
must be owned, that the subsequent marriage
of their parents, by the law of Scotland, le∣gitimated
them to all intents and purposes.
But further, because they were born out of
the kingdom, it was thought necessary to get
an act of legitimation from the crown, which
they obtained, both under the privy and great

male issue, succeeded to his estate and honours,
and was second lord Evandale.</P>
<P>He sat as a peer in the parliaments called
to meet at Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1505, and dying

<P>VI. ANDREW, third lord Evandale, who
exchanged with sir James Hamilton of Fin∣nart
the barony and lordship of Evandale, in
Lanark-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist.</NOTE> for the barony of Ochiltrie, in

<P>In his father's lifetime, he married Marga∣rer,

by whom he had three sons, and three

<P>There is a remarkable protest taken in par∣liament
by sir James Stewart earl of Arran,
grandson of Andrew second lord Ochiltrie,
which properly should come in under the title
Ochiltrie; but that family being now extinct,
as before observed, we shall insert it here. It
is in these words:</P>
<Q><P>"James earl of Arran, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> protests for
himself, and in name of his father's house
of Ochiltrie, that neither the duke of Len∣nox's

<P>He was killed at Dunblain by the laird of

of several lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> which were all erected into
one free barony, to be called the barony of
Down, <HI>anno</HI> 1565.</P>
<P>He was commendator of St. Colme, and was
made a knight baronet when Henry lord
Darnly was created earl of Ross.</P>
<P>He was a steady friend of queen Mary dur∣ing
the civil war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd, Stewart, &amp;c.</NOTE> and his castle of Down was

<P>He was also appointed collector-general of

to be possessed of many eminent quali∣ties,
even when a young man, and was in great
favour with king James VI. by whose special
appointment he married lady Elizabeth Stew∣art,
eldest daughter and co-heiress of the late

which he got a charter under the great seal,

of many lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>inter</HI> 1581, <HI>et</HI> 1584.</P>

<P>X. JAMES, fourth earl of Murray, who,
by the king's mediation and special appoint∣ment,
<HI>anno</HI> 1601, married lady Anne Gordon,
daughter of George sixth earl of Huntly, in
hopes thereby to remove the animosities that
subsisted between the two families, which had
already occasioned much bloodshed, by their
burning and plundering one another's lands;
the earl of Athole, with the Grants, Dunbars,
MacIntosnes, Clanchatton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> having taken
part with the earl of Murray, and the Gor∣dons,

<P>I. DAVID LESLY, fifth son of Patrick first
lord Lindores, being a younger brother,
and having a genius for arms, went abroad to
push his fortune in the foreign wars, got into
the service of the king of Sweden in Germa∣ny,
and having remarkably distinguished him∣self
upon several occasions for his military skill
and capacity, soon rose to the rank of a colo∣nel
of horse.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the civil war,
he returned to Scotland, entered into the ser∣vice
of the parliament, was appointed lieute∣nant-general
of the forces they sent to Eng∣land,
to the parliament's assistance against the
king.</P>
<P>Immediately after the battle of Nasby, he
made a quick march with a considerable bo∣dy
of horse to Scotland, surprised and defeated
the great Montrose at Philiphaugh, <HI>anno</HI>
1645, and, for his good and faithful services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE>
got a gift from the parliament of fifty thou∣sand
merks, to be paid out of the fine impos∣ed
upon the marquis of Douglas for being on
the king's side, 18th March 1646.</P>
<P>He was declared lieutenant-general of all
the forces in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> had a pension of one
thousand pounds <HI>per</HI> month settled on him,
29th February 1647, and that besides his pay
as colonel of the Perth-shire horse.</P>
<P>When the Scots determined to raise an ar∣my
to rescue the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts, and mi∣nutes of parlt.</NOTE> Mr. Lesly was made
general of the horse, by a commission dated
11th May 1648; and from this time fore∣ward,
he appears to have been a loyal subject;
however, he was then laid aside, and general
Middleton obtained the chief command,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> by
a commission dated 19th June, that same year.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king (which hor∣rible
scene general Lesly had in the utmost
detestation) none appeared more desirous of
a restoration of the royal family than the ge∣neral.</P>
<P>When the Scots declared for king Charles
II. and began to raise forces for his service,
in 1650, general Lesly was appointed one of
their chief commanders, and soon got into
great favour with his majesty.</P>
<P>And though he was defeated at Dunbar by
Oliver Cromwell, yet it is acknowledged he
acted the part of a brave and able officer.</P>
<P>After the king was crowned at Scoon, in
January 1651, there was a new army levied,
which the king commanded in person, and
Mr. Lesly was appoined major-general. But at
the unfortunate battle of Worcester he was
taken prisoner, and committed to the tower
of London, where he continued confined till
the restoration of king Charles II. in May
1660.</P>
<P>The king, in reward of his faithful ser∣vices,
and great sufferings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in pub. archiv. haered. masc. ex ejus corp.</NOTE> was pleased to
raise him to the dignity of the peerage, by
the title of baron of Newark, in the county
of Fife, by patent to the heirs-male of his bo∣dy,
dated 31st August 1660, and settled on
him a pension of five hundred pounds <HI>per ann.</HI></P>
<P>Lord Newark at that time had some ene∣mies
at court, who endeavoured to inpress the
king with bad notions of his sincerity and in∣tegrity;
but the king, being convinced of
his honesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original let∣ter, pen. dom. Newark.</NOTE> wrote a letter to him with his
own hand, which is still preserved in the fa∣mily;
wherein his majesty assures him, that
he is perfectly satisfied of his honour and loy∣alty;
that it is not in the power of the ma∣lice
of his enemies to lessen his esteem of
him; that if he had occasion to levy an army
for his own service, he would not fail to give
his lordship a command in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He married Jean, daughter of sir John
York, of the kingdom of England, knight, by

<HEAD>MAXWELL Earl of NITHSDALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Maxwell is mentioned
in our oldest records, as soon as sirnames
began to be frequently used in Scotland.</P>
<P>Their immediate ancestor, Machus, or Ma∣cus,
lived in the reign of king Malcolm Can∣more,
appears to have been a man of rank,
and had considerable possessions in the county
of Roxburgh, which were afterwards called
the barony and parish of Macuswell, and from
thence the sirname of the family.</P>
<P>A learned and judicious antiquary says, he
has often met with the name of Machus in

<P>He says also, that Herbert, the donor of the

<P>This lord having been divested of his of∣fice

upon John Johnston of that ilk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which

found an opportunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, &amp;c.</NOTE> and put to death sir
James Johnston of that ilk, son of the last
John, for which he was tried, condemned,

to whom we now return.</P>
<P>IV. Sir JAMES STEWART of Bothwel∣muir,
second son of Andrew, third lord Ochil∣trie,
was a man of good parts, an aspiring ge∣nius,
and most unbounded ambition. He be∣came
a great favourite of king James VI. and
was raised to the highest offices of state.</P>
<P>As there is a full account of his life and
transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 137. &amp;c.</NOTE> published in the lives of the of∣ficers
of state, to that we re er our readers,
and shall only here briefly mention some of
the most remarkable occurrences of his life.</P>
<P>He was created earl of Arran, lord Hamil∣ton,
Abercorn, Bothwel-haugh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he was
captain of the guards, provost of the town of
Edinburgh, governor of the castles of Edin∣burgh
and St<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rling, and chancellor of Scotland,
<HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Stewart, daugh∣ter
of John fourth earl of Athole, by whom
he had two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>James</HI> of Killeth, afterwards lord
Ochiltrie.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Henry,</HI> who had issue only two daugh∣ters;
the first married to Henry third lord
Methven; the second married to colonel
—Stewart.</P>
<P>The earl of Arran, after many and various
scenes of life, was divested of all his offices
and titles of honour, and for several years liv∣ed
a retired life, without any other designa∣tion
than that of captain Stewart; and he hav∣ing
been the regent Morton's accuser, was, in
revenge thereof, put to death by sir James Dou∣glas
of Torthorald, <HI>anno</HI> 1596.</P>
<P>V. Sir JAMES STEWART of Killeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hist.</NOTE> el∣dest
son of James earl of Arran, became lord
Ochiltrie, upon the resignation of Andrew
the fourth lord, as before observed, <HI>anno</HI>
1615.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Ja∣cobo
domino Ochiltrie,</HI> of the lands and superi∣ority
of Polquharn, and others, <HI>anno</HI> 1616.</P>
<P>He afterwards most foolishly and unjustly
accused the marquis of Hamilton of having a
design upon the crown, which upon trial was
<PB N="524" REF="555"/>
found to be without the least foundation;
whereupon the lord Ochiltrie was ordered to
be confined in the castle of Blackness for life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journals of justiciary.</NOTE>
He remained there many years, but was at last
liberate by the English, after the battle of
Worcester, <HI>anno</HI> 1652.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1659, having married Mar∣garet,
daughter of Uchtred MacDougal of
Garthland, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>VI.—master of Ochiltrie, who
died before his father, leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. WILLIAM lord Ochiltrie, who suc∣ceeded
his grandfather, and was a youth of
great hopes and spirit. He died at the uni∣versity
of Edinburgh, in the 16th year of his
age, unmarried, <HI>anno</HI> 1675, whereby the ho∣nours
became extinct.</P>

<HEAD>OLIPHANT Lord OLIPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>THO' few families have made a greater fi∣gure
in the annals of Scotland, than
that of Oliphant, yet the traditional accounts
of their origin are various. Some alledge,
that when Harold king of Norway invaded
Scotland with a powerful fleet and army, in
the reign of king Donald VI. a noble Nor∣wegian,
called sir Donald Oliphard, was taken
prisoner by the king of Scots, and being a
man of rank and distinction, was treated ac∣cording
to his quality and merit. A peace
being afterwards concluded betwixt the two
crowns, sir Donald had liberty to return home;
but being pleased with the entertainment he
met with, and having contracted a friendship
with several of the first quality, he married
and settled in this country, and he is said to
have been progenitor of all the Oliphants in
Scotland.</P>
<P>However, we shall insist no longer on tra∣ditional
accounts, but proceed to deduce the
descent of this most ancient and noble fami∣ly,
by unquestionable documents from,</P>
<P>I. DAVID de HOLIFARD or OLIFARD,
a man of rank and figure in Scotland, in the
reign of king Alexander I. He appears to have
been much about the court of king David,
who, upon the death of king Alexander, suc∣ceeded
to the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1124.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch barons, who ac∣companied
that prince to England, when he
went with an army to the assistance of Maud
the empress, his niece, against king Stephen,
but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrvmple's collections, p. 174.</NOTE> upon the raising of the siege of Wince∣ster,
king David was so hotly pursued by the
English army, that had it not been for the va∣lour
and courage of this David de Oliphard,
he had been taken prisoner, <HI>anno</HI> 1142.</P>
<P>King David, in reward of this noble action,
is said to have made him a grant of several
lands, both in the Lothians and in Perth-shire,
but we do not find them so early mentioned
in our records.</P>
<P>In king David I.'s grants to the priory of
Coldingham, David de Olifard is a witness, and
his seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Coldingham, Nisbet, vol. I. p. 244.</NOTE> being three crescents, is thereto ap∣pended,
which is the armorial bearing of the
Oliphants to this day, a convincing proof that
this David was progenitor of this noble fami∣ly.</P>
<P>In the reign of the same king David, there
happened a dispute betwixt Robert bishop of
St. Andrews, and G. abbot of Dunfermline:
It was submitted to king David and his son
prince Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concordia fact, &amp;c. Chartulary of Dunfermline.</NOTE> and was by them accorded to
the satisfaction of both parties, to which Da∣vid
de Olifard, and Herbert, great chamber∣lain
of Scotland, were witnesses. This deed
is without date, but Herbert was chamberlain
from 1122 to 1144, in which space that a∣greement
must have been concluded.</P>
<P>This David appears to have had issue five
sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>David,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William de Olifard,</HI> who was one of the
hostages for king William the Lyon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom▪ I. p. 39.</NOTE> when
he was set at liberty by the English, after the
battle of Alnwick, <HI>anno</HI> 1174; and was, with

<P>3. <HI>Walter de Olifard,</HI> who was witness to

<P>5. <HI>Fulcione de Olifard,</HI> who is witness in a

worth and merit, and highly esteemed by king
Malcolm IV. who succeeded king David, <HI>anno</HI>
1153.</P>
<P>In a charter of that prince, to the abbot
and convent of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> Herbert bishop of Glas∣gow,
William bishop of Murray, David de O∣lifard,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are witnesses, in or before 1162,
in which year William bishop of Murray di∣ed.</P>
<P>He is witness also in several charters and
donations of king William, who succeeded
king Malcolm, <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He was likewise in great favour with that
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Scoon.</NOTE> who, in the beginning of his reign,
constituted him justiciar of Lothian, which
office was long enjoyed by him and his poste∣rity.</P>
<P>In a donation of the said king William, to
the abbacy of Dunfermline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dunfermline.</NOTE> Nicol the chan∣cellor,
Richard de Morvile constable, David
de Olifard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are witnesses, in or before
1171, in which year the chancellor died.</P>
<P>This David had issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>David de Olifard,</HI> who is witness in a
donation of king Alexander II. to the abbot
and convent of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> and is then designed
brother of Walter de Olifard, justiciar of Lo∣thian,
<HI>anno</HI> 1234.</P>
<P>He died before the year 1200, and was
succeeded by his eldestson,</P>
<P>III. Sir WALTER OLIFARD, who married
Christian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strathallan's history of the Drummonds.</NOTE> daughter of the earl of Strathearn,
by whom he got the lands and parish of Stra∣geith,
<HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1200.</P>
<P>He afterwards exchanged the lands of Stra∣geith
for some others in Perth-shire, with Gil∣bert
earl of Strathearn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his brother-in-law, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1220.</P>
<P>He was in great favour with king Alexan∣der
II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Scoon.</NOTE> who, in the beginning of his reign,
constituted him justiciar of Lothian.</P>
<P>When the marriage betwixt king Alexan∣der
II. and princess Johanna, eldest daughter
of king Henry III. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 241.</NOTE> was set on
foot, this sir Walter was one of the sureties
on the part of king Alexander, <HI>anno</HI> 1220.</P>
<P>And when the queen's jointure was adjust∣ed
and settled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 252,</NOTE> <HI>dominus Walterus de Olifard
justiciarius Loudoniae,</HI> is one of the witnesses,
<HI>anno</HI> 1221.</P>
<P>He was witness also to king Alexander II.'s
confirmation charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> of the privileges of the
monastery of Kelso, <HI>anno</HI> 1222.</P>
<P>He appears to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esided constantly about
the court of king Alexander; for he is wit∣ness
to innumerable charters and donations
of that prince to the religious of Kelso, Dun∣fermline,
Holyrood-house, Newbottle, and
Paisley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chronicle of Melrose.</NOTE> betwixt the years 1220 and 1242,
in which last year he died, according to these
words; <HI>dominus Gualterus de Olifard justici∣arius
Loudoniae obiit anno</HI> 1242.</P>
<P>By the said Christian he left issue a son and
successor,</P>
<P>IV. WALTERUS de OLIFARD, who
appears to have been proprietor of lands
in Striling-shire, as well as in the Lothi∣ans;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle.</NOTE>
for in a convention betwixt the abbots

there are mentioned the lands of Kal∣lantyr,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Stirling-shire, which they held
in seu-farm of Walter de Olifard and David
Cummin, <HI>anno</HI> 1245.</P>
<P>This Walter afterwards renounced any
right, he had by his mother, to the church
of Strageith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> in favours of Gilbert earl of
Strathearn, the patronage whereof that earl
had made over to the monks of Inchaflry, <HI>pro

<P>He had issue three sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>William,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugh.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Walter.</HI></P>
<P>These two last became bound with their
brother sir William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 950.</NOTE> to surrender the castle
of Stirling to king Edward of England, if it
was not relieved in a certain space, in 1304.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>V. Sir WILLIAM de OLIFARD, <HI>dominus
de Aberdalgy,</HI> the first of the family we find
designed by that title.</P>
<P>He was a great hero and patriot, a strenuous
defender of the liberties of his country.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles whom
king Edward I. of England compelled to
swear allegiance to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 769.</NOTE> when he had over∣run
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1297; but it seems he
did not depend much upon their fidelity; for
he carried him, and several others of the first
rank, prisoners to London: however, the
year thereafter they obtained liberty to return
to Scotland, upon their obliging themselves,
or finding bail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 498.</NOTE> to stay no longer at home
than was necessary to equip themselves in or∣der
to return, and serve king Edward in the
army he designed to employ against France.
But those worthy patriots were so far from
thinking,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> that oaths extorted by force were
binding, that they immediately joined the
nonjurors and loyalists, in defence of the li∣berties
of their country.</P>
<P>This brave man was appointed governor of
the castle of Stirling, which he gallantly de∣fended
for a long time.</P>
<P>King Edward at last besieged it in person,
with the whole English army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in 1303, but
<PB N="526" REF="557"/>
sir William made such a glorious defence, that
he obliged that great prince to raise the siege.</P>
<P>The year thereafter, king Edward set down
before it again, with all the forces he was
able to bring to the field, and it was then the
only fort in Scotland that he was not in pos∣session
of.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. and Ry∣mer, v. II. p. 950.</NOTE> Sir William defended it for
three months more against them all; but at

<HEAD>VALONIIS Lord of PANMURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Valoniis is originally
from France, is local, and was first as∣sumed
by the proprietors of the viscounty
and town of Valoines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden, Hollinshed, &amp; du Chesne's hist. Norman script.</NOTE> in the country of Con∣stantine
in Normandy, where they had large
possessions.</P>
<P>The immediate ancestor of this noble fa∣mily
was,</P>
<P>I. Sir PETER de VALONIIS, a man of
the first rank in Normandy, who accompa∣nied
William the Conqueror to England, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1066, and was one of his chief comman∣ders.</P>
<P>And as that great prince divided the con∣quered
lands amongst his brave officers accord∣ing
to their merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba∣ronage, and Lives of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffic. of state.</NOTE> so this sir Peter had a large
share in six different counties, <HI>viz.</HI> Essex,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Hartford, Cambridge,
and Lincoln-shire.</P>
<P>He being possessed of no less than fifty-seven
lordships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his posterity became peers, or
<HI>barones majores,</HI> and were amongst the most
powerful subjects in England.</P>
<P>Sir Peter de Valoniis was high sheriff of
Essex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and had his chief residence at the castle
of Orford in Suffolk.</P>
<P>He lived long after William the Conquer∣or
and his son William Rufus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and was in
great favour with king Henry I. from whom
he obtained the manors of Essenden, Bedge∣ford,
the mills of Hartford, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And being no less an able statesman than
a brave soldier, he was joined in commission
with the bishop of Lincoln,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monast. An∣glican.</NOTE> and others, to
accommodate the differences concerning the
church of Rippon, which was done to the sa∣tisfaction
of all parties.</P>
<P>He was a liberal benefactor to the religi∣ous,
and, with consent of Abreda his wife,
he founded and largely endowed the priory of
Benham in Norfolk, for the salvation of
the souls of William the Conqueror, Maud
his queen, for the good state of king Henry
I. <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>

and there being no succession of the

as before observed, the representation of that
most noble family devolved upon the descend∣ants
of Philip the fifth son, before-mentioned,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>III. PHILIP, fifth son of Roger second
lord de Valoniis, came to Scotland in the
end of the reign of king Malcolm IV. who
succeeded to the crown <HI>anno</HI> 1153.</P>
<P>He being a man of great parts and merit,
became a mighty favourite of king William,
who succeeded king Malcolm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley, Ar∣broath, Dun∣fermline, New bottle, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1165.</P>
<P>He appears to have been much about that

charters and donations to the religious.</P>
<P>After the king had the misfortune to be
taken prisoner at the battle of Alnwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, Ro∣ger Hovedon, &amp;c.</NOTE> this
Philip de Valoniis was one of the hostages for
his ransom, <HI>anno</HI> 1174.</P>
<P>The king, in reward of his merit, and good
and faithful services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes comitem de Panmure,</NOTE> made him a grant of the
baronies of Panmure and Benvine, in Forfarshire,
which first became the chief seat and
title of his family.</P>
<P>And as his majesty thought he could never
do too much for so good and faithful a sub∣ject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE>
he appointed him lord great chamber∣lain
of Scotland, in 1180, of which there are
innumerable documents in our records and
chartularies.</P>
<P>As he was possessed of lands in many dif∣ferent
counties in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermline, Melross, Pai∣sley, New∣bottle, &amp;c.</NOTE> besides that of

<P>He also gave a tost and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of land in his
barony of Panmure to the monks at Coupar,
which was afterwards confirmed by his de∣scendant,
sir Thomas Maule of Panmure, in
1456.</P>
<P>He succeeded also to part of his brother
Geoffrey's possessions in England, as before
observed, whereby he became possessed of a
large estate in that kingdom as well as in
Scotland.</P>

to the crown, this Philip de Valoniis was a∣gain

at the first <HI>conventus procerum</HI> held by that

<HEAD>MAULE Earl of PANMURE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the noble and illustrious name of
Maule is of very great antiquity, is ac∣knowledged
by all our historians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction to Fleming's edition of For∣dun, p. 60.</NOTE> and our
best antiquaries are of opinion, that they are
originally from France, and that a noble fa∣mily,
who had large possessions in that coun∣try,
assumed their sirname from the town of
Maule on the confines of Normandy, which
had been their own property in very early
times.</P>
<P>Certain it is the family of Maule made a
considerable figure in France before William
the Conqueror came over to England, and
flourished with great lustre in that kingdom
for many ages thereafter, which will sufficient∣ly
appear from what follows.</P>
<P>I. ANSOLD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Labourer's history of Chamont.</NOTE> lord of Maule, with Rectrude

his military skill in the wars of Italy and
Greece. He was with Robert duke of Apu∣lia,
at the siege of Durazzo, and distinguished
himself at that great battle, where Alexis em∣peror
of Constantinople was overthrown, <HI>an∣no</HI>

<P>As a further account of the Maules in

France, does not regularly fall within the plan
of this work, but is to be found in many
French historians, an abridgment whereof is
in Mr. Nisbet, vol. II. p. 48 and 49, to these
we refer our readers, and shall only add, that
this family flourished in France with much
grandeur, till the end of the XIVth century,
that Robert the last lord was killed at the
battle of Nicopolis in Hungary, fighting a∣gainst
the Turks, <HI>anno</HI> 1398. His coat of
arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. II. p. 49.</NOTE> which is the very same with the earl of
Panmure's, was set up in Notre Dame church
of Maule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland, vol. II. p. 183,&amp;c.</NOTE> and all his great estate went to his
daughter and sole heiress,</P>
<P><HI>Reginolde de Maule,</HI> who was married to
Simon de Moranvilliers, lord of Harcourt.</P>
<P>The male line of Peter, eldest son of An∣sold,
third lord of Maule, thus ending, the re∣presentation
of that noble family fell to the
descendants of his brother Guarin, to whom
we now return.</P>
<P>I. GUARIN, second son of Ansold, third
lord of Maule, progenitor of this noble fami∣ly.
Being then a younger brother, and a
man of great spirit and resolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ire∣land, vol. II. p. 183.</NOTE> accompa∣nied
William the Conqueror to England, <HI>anno</HI>
1066, where he had a considerable command,
and is particularly named as one of his chief
officers in the roll of Battle-abbey.</P>
<P>And as that great prince shared the lands
of England, amongst those who distinguished
themselves in the conquest of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holinshed, v. II. p. 296.</NOTE> Guarin de
Maule had the great lordship of Hatton de
Cleveland, in Yorkshire assigned him.</P>
<P>He died before 1100, leaving issue two sons,</P>
<P>Robert.</P>
<P>Stephen.</P>
<P>Which of them was the eldest we shall not
pretend to determine, but,</P>
<P>II. ROBERT de MAULE, carried on the
line of this family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monast. An∣glican. vol. II. p, 75.</NOTE> and with his brother Ste∣phen,
made donations to the abbacy of Whit∣by

<P>This Robert having contracted a friendship

came to Scotland with that good prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Ireland.</NOTE>

that generous prince rewarded with the lands
and barony of Foulis in Perthsnire, out of

Suffolk, Cambridge, Essex, and Hartford, by

in Scotland and England; but king Edward I.
deprived his grand-son, sir Henry Maule, of
all his English estates, on account of his great
attachment and firm adherence to king Ro∣bert
Bruce.</P>

leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>XIV. Sir THOMAS MAULE of Panmure,
who succeeded his grandfather. He was
highly esteemed by king James IV. who
knighted him. He was also in great favour
with the clergy, having been appointed bailie
of Barry by the abbot of Cupar in 1511, a
jurisdiction of considerable weight before the
reformation, and only bestowed on those who
were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irm friends of the church.</P>
<P>He attended king James to the battle of
Flowdon, and, to his singular honour, when
many of the first quality left the king before
the armies engaged, he, though well advanc∣ed
in years,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Scotl. Ireland, Scots comp. et chart. pe∣nes comit. de Panmure.</NOTE> and very corpulent, would not
desert him, but fought with remarkable cou∣rage,
and received many wounds, of which he
instantly died in the field, on 9th of Septem∣ber
1513.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Elizabeth, daughter and
coheiress of sir David Rollo of Ballachie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by

<P>His daughter, <HI>Isabel,</HI> was married to—
Ramsay of Panbride.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Christian, daughter of
William lord Graham, ancestor of the duke of
Montrose, by Jean his wife, daughter of Ar∣chibald
earl of Angus, but by her he had no
issue.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. ROBERT MAULE, <HI>dominus de Pan∣mure,</HI>
who was one of those loyal barons that
endeavoured to rescue king James V. from
the earls of Arran and Angus, by whom he
was kept little better than a captive, and
with that view, joined the earl of Lennox at
the fight near Linlithgow bridge, <HI>anno</HI> 1526;
of which generous design, the king, when he
came of age, retained so lasting a sense, that
he treated him ever after with the greatest
respect and esteem; and in 1528, granted him
a dispensation (for his true and faithful ser∣vices)
to remain at home, during life, free
from all attendance in parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes com. de Pan∣mure.</NOTE> courts of
justiciary, hostings, roads, within or without
the realm, by sea or land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, he no sooner saw
his country threatened with danger by party
and faction, after the death of that king, than
he raised his vassals and followers, and with
lord Gray, attacked lord Ruthven in Perth,
and held out that town against the queen's
authority. He began the attack, and was
taken prisoner, but the affair was soon there∣after
compromised.</P>
<P>He strenuously opposed the match between
queen Mary and prince Edward of England,
from an apprehension that his country might
suffer in its independency and its privileges
by such an union.</P>
<P>When the war between the two nations
commenced, his loyalty being well known,
<PB N="544" REF="575"/>
the English, after the battle of Pinkie, sent a
strong party to surprise and attack him at his
own house, where he made a vigorous de∣fence,
but, being over-powered, received ma∣ny
wounds, and was at last forced to surren∣der.
He was immediately sent prisoner to
London, and was confined in the tower above
twelve months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peerage of Scotland, Ire∣land, &amp;c.</NOTE> and at last was released by
the interest of the marquis d'Elbuife, the
French ambassador for Scotland, in whose com∣pany
he returned home, <HI>anno</HI> 1549.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Isabel, daughter of sir
Laurence Mercer of Aldie, and got a charter
of the lands of Panlethy, in the regality of
Kirriemuir, upon the forfeiture of Archibald
earl of Angus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haddington's collections.</NOTE> to him and Isabel Mercer, his

with consent of Robert Maule his father,
granted a charter to Elizabeth Beaton, daugh∣ter
of cardinal David Beaton, of half of the
lands of Skryne and an annualrent of twenty
merks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haddington's collections.</NOTE> for a certain sum paid him, <HI>anno</HI> 1541.

<P>He was a man of great natural accomplish∣ments,
which were much improved by a libe∣ral
education. Soon after he returned from
his travels, he signalized himself at the battle
of Haldonrig against the English.</P>
<P>He was taken prisoner, and sent to Mor∣peth,
where he remained till king Henry VIII.
after the death of king James V. politically
released all the Scotch prisoners of note, hop∣ing
to engage them to promote the intended
marriage of his son prince Edward with queen
Mary; which not succeeding, and the war
breaking out afresh, he was in the van of the
Scotch army at the bloody battle of Pinky∣cleugh,
where, with great difficulty, he e∣scaped,
many of his friends and vassals having
been killed on the spot.</P>
<P>In 1563, John Scrimgeour, constable of

2. Robert, who was gentleman of the privy
chamber to king Charles I. Thomas was a
man of great honour, loyalty and courage:
he adhered firmly to the king's interest dur∣ing
all the time of the civil war. He was
first lieutenant-colonel of the marquis of Or∣mond's
regiment, and afterwards acted as ge∣neral
in Ireland, where he always behaved
with conduct and resolution. He at last mar∣ried
and settled there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and became the head
of a numerous and considerable family in that

Thomas, <HI>dominus de Panmure,</HI> died on 7th
March 1600,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes comitem de Panmure.</NOTE> and was succeeded by his eld∣est
son,</P>
<P>XVII. PATRICK, <HI>dominus de Panmure,</HI>
who was appointed bailie of the barony of
Barry by king James VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which jurisdiction
his ancestors had long exerced by commission
from the abbots of Coupar and Balmerino,
but it has been enjoyed heretably by the fa∣mily
ever since.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter of sir John
Erskine of Dun, superintendant of Angus and
Mearns, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Patrick,</HI>—and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Jean,</HI> married to David Erskine of
Dun.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Barbara,</HI> married to James Strachan of
Carmylie.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1605, and was succeeded by
his only son,</P>
<P>XVIII. PATRICK MAULE of Panmure,
afterwards earl, who, being endowed with
many excellent qualities, and of singular affa∣bility,
was a mighty favourite of king James
VI. whom he accompanied to London at his
majesty's desire, when he went to take pos∣session
of the English throne, <HI>anno</HI> 1603, and
was made one of the gentlemen of his bed-chamber.
The king, being perfectly sensible
of his great capacity and fine accomplishments,
had him always in great esteem.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1610, he got a new charter of his
antient barony of Panmure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> also charters of
a great many other baronies.</P>
<P>In the reign of king Charles I. with his
majesty's approbation, he purchased the abbacy
of Arbroath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> which had been erected into a
temporal lordship, <HI>anno</HI> 1608, whereby he
became proprietor of a greater number of pa∣tronages
than were possest by any other sub∣ject.</P>
<P>And the king's regard for him still increas∣ing,
he recommended him, in the strongest
manner, to his son prince Charles, as one he
might entirely rely on for honour and fideli∣ty,
of which king Charles, in his trouble∣some
reign, had many convincing proofs.</P>
<P>He was continued in the bed-chamber,
and made keeper of his majesty's house and
park at Eltham in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chivis Car. I.</NOTE> and sheriff prin∣cipal
of the county of Forfar in Scotland,
<HI>anno</HI> 1632, and got also charters from the king,
of a great many other lands and baronies.</P>
<P>During the civil wars he attended the king
in all his battles, and never deserted him on
any occasion whatsomever. The king, in re∣gard
and recompence of his constant loyalty
and faithful services, was pleased, as a lasting
mark of his affection and esteem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mure, Crawfurd &amp; Lodge.</NOTE> to create
him earl of Panmure, lord Maule of Brechin
and Navar, upon the 30th day of August,
1646.</P>
<P>When the king, by order of parliament,
was deprived of all his domesticks at Holmby,
in Northampton-shire, he only desired that
two of his old servants should be allowed to
remain with him, of which the earl of Pan∣mure
was one. He attended him close in all
his removes, till at last he and all his attend∣ants
were finally discharged by colonel Ham∣mond,
in the isle of Wight, which was a most
sensible affliction both to his majesty and the
earl, who immediately repaired to Scotland,
when he could do no more service to his roy∣al
master.</P>
<P>And though he lived quietly at home, be∣ing
very aged, yet Cromwell thought fit to
impose a fine upon him often thousand pounds
sterling;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Printed ordi∣nance of Cromwell's council, anno 1654.</NOTE> but it was afterwards mitigated to
four thousand pounds sterling, which he paid
on 25th June 1655, besides one thousand
pounds more for his second son, on 29th Sep∣tember
thereafter.</P>
<P>However, he had the happiness to outlive
all these misfortunes, and to see the accom∣plishment
of his most ardent wishes, <HI>viz.</HI> the
king's restoration, though he did not long
survive it.</P>
<P>He married thrice: 1st, Frances, daughter
of sir Edward Stanhope of Grin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and peerage of Ireland, &amp;c.</NOTE> in the
county of York, lord president of the council
of the north, uncle to the first earl of Chel∣terfield,
by whom he had two sons, and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> earl of Panmure.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Henry</HI> of Balmakellie, who was like∣ways
a great loyalist, and had the command
of a regiment both under king Charles I. and
II. and always performed the part of a gallant
officer, and never deserted the royal cause.
He married, 1st, lady Jean, daughter of John
earl of Wemyss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by whom he had one daugh∣ter,
Mary, who died young. He married,
2dly, Margaret, daughter of—Dou∣glas
of Spot, by whom he had another daugh∣ter,
Margaret, married to Alexander Coch∣ran
of Balbachly.</P>
<P>The earl's 1st daughter, lady <HI>Jean,</HI> was
married to David earl of Northesk, and had
a numerous issue.</P>
<P>His 2d daughter, lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was mar∣ried,
1st, to John earl of Kinghorn; 2dly,
to George earl of Linlithgow, and was mo∣ther
of three earls, <HI>viz.</HI> Strathmore, Linlith∣gow,
and Kalendar.</P>
<P>The earl married, 2dly, Mary Waldrum,
maid of honour to queen Henrietta.</P>
<P>And, 3dly, he married lady Mary Erskine,
<PB N="546" REF="577"/>
daughter of John earl of Marr; but by nei∣ther
had he any issue.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1661, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIX. GEORGE, second earl of Panmure,
who chanced to be travelling through Italy
and France for his education, during the heat
of the civil war, yet he no sooner returned
home, than he gave sufficient proof of his in∣heriting
the same virtues and loyal principles
with his predecessors.</P>
<P>When king Charles II. came to Scotland
in 1650, he immediately waited on his ma∣jesty,
and heartily engaged in his service;
and being appointed colonel of the Forfar re∣giment
of horse, many of the principal gentle∣men
of the county, out of respect to his lord∣ship,
joined his regiment, and served under
him as officers.</P>
<P>He fought upon their head at the battles
of Dunbar and Innerkeithing, at the latter of
which he was wounded, his lieutenan-colonel,
his major, and many of his officers, being
killed on the spot.</P>
<P>After the defeat at Worcester, the loyal∣ists,
from all parts, resorted to him, and put
themselves under his command; in which
station,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and peerage of Ireland, &amp;c.</NOTE> by frequent skirmishes and incursions,
he gave great uneasiness to general Monk,
who then commanded in Scotland; but at
last he was forced to capitulate (when he
found he could do no more service to the
king) without any other terms, than these of
laying down his arms.</P>
<P>He married lady Jean Campbell, daughter
of John earl of Loudoun, lord high chancellor
of Scotland, in the reign of king Charles I.
by whom he had issue seven sons, and two
daughters, though only three sons, and one
daughter, came to age.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> earl of Panmure.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James Maule</HI> of Balumby, who succeed∣ed
his brother.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Harry Maule</HI> of Kelly, who carried on
the line of the family.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Mary,</HI> was married, 1st,
to Charles earl of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and was mother of
John earl of Marr; she married, 2dly, colo∣nel
John Erskine, son of sir Charles Erskine
of Alva.</P>
<P>The earl died on 24th March 1671, and
was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XX. GEORGE, third earl of Panmure,
who was of the privy council both to king
Charles II. and king James VII.</P>
<P>He married lady Jean Fleming, only daugh∣ter
of John earl of Wigton, by whom he had
only one son,</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> lord Maule, who died an infant.</P>
<P>And he dying in 1686,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his estate and ho∣nours
devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>XX. JAMES of Balumby, fourth earl of
Panmure, who, having got a liberal education
abroad, served in the army as a volunteer,
and signalized himself at the siege of Luxem∣burgh.</P>
<P>He was sworn one of the privy council to
king James VII. but as he could not comply
with the court in abrogating the penal laws,
he was soon removed from being a privy
councillor; and tho' he was always a staunch
protestant, yet at the convention of estates
in 1689, he vigorously appeared for the in∣terest
of king James; and when the crown
was settled on king William and queen Mary,
he refused to take the oaths to them, and left
the house.</P>
<P>He likeways opposed the union with all
his interest, as judging it inconsistent with
the honour and independency of Scotland.</P>
<P>In 1715 he joined his nephew, John earl
of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodge's peer∣age of Ireland vol. II. p. 194, and Scots compend.</NOTE> and behaved most he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oically at the
battle of Sheriffmuir, notwithstanding his
age, and the delicacy of his constitution. He
was taken prisoner in the field, but was in∣stantly
rescued by his brother Harry.</P>
<P>He afterwards retired to Paris, and being
attainted of high treason, his estate and ho∣nours
were forfeited to the crown.</P>
<P>He married lady Margaret Hamilton,
daughter of William duke of Hamilton, and
died at Paris without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1723.</P>
<P>XX. HARRY MAULE of Kellie, his bro∣ther,
would have succeeded both to the e∣state
and honours of Panmure, had it not
been for the earl his brother's attainder.</P>
<P>This Harry was a man of great parts, both
natural and acquired, and had spent much of
his time at the courts of England and France.</P>
<P>He was a member of the convention of e∣states
at the revolution, and followed his bro∣ther's
example, when he found they were re∣solved
to forfeit king James, and then left
the assembly.</P>
<P>He afterwards retired, and being a man of
great learning, spent most of his time in the
study of the laws and antiquities of his coun∣try,
and was one of the greatest antiquaries
of the age he lived in.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Mary Fleming, daugh∣ter
of William earl of Wigton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and peerage of Ireland.</NOTE> by whom he
had three sons, and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> who died young.</P>

<P>He married, 2dly, Anne, daughter of Pa∣trick
Lindsay of Kilbirnie, sister of John first
viscount of Garnock, by whom he had five
sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Patrick,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John Maule</HI> of Inverkeillor, Esq; who,
being an advocate, was made keeper of the
register of sasines in 1737. In 1739, he was

<P>3. Thomas.</P>
<P>4. David.</P>
<P>5. Charles.</P>
<P>These three last died unmarried, as did

<P>He died in 1734, and was succeeded by
his only surviving son of the first marriage,</P>
<P>XXI. WILLIAM, now earl of Panmure,
who was chosen member of parliament for
the shire of Forfar in 1735, and hath conti∣nued
to represent that county ever since; and
as his genius inclined him to a military life,
he was made a captain in the third regiment
of guards, <HI>anno</HI> 1737.</P>
<P>In 1741, he was made colonel thereof,
with which he served in Flanders during all
the course of the late war, having been en∣gaged
in the battles of Dettingen, Valdt,
Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tenoy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and always acquitted himself
with honour and reputation.</P>
<P>In 1747, he got the command of a regi∣ment

<P>He was created a peer of Ireland by his

<HEAD>DRUMMOND Earl of PERTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE family of Drummond has been al∣ways
ranked amongst the most ancient
and illustrious names of the Scotch nation,
highly distinguished by a long train of worthy
ancestors, no less remarkable for the noble al∣liances
they made, and the dignities conferred
upon them, than for personal merit.</P>
<P>They have the honour to be several times
sprung from the royal house of Stewart, and
can boast what few subjects can do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strathallan, Lesly, Van Bassan, sir G MacKenzie, Hathornden, Bayle, Mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> That most
of the crowned heads in Europe are descend∣ed
from them, as will clearly appear by the
following memoirs.</P>
<P>The traditional account of their origin,
handed down to us by several good histori∣ans,
is,</P>
<P>I. That an Hungarian gentleman named
MAURICIUS, or MAURICE, a son of George,
a younger son of Andrew, king of Hungary,
had the command of the ship in which Ed∣gar
Atheline, the rightful heir to the English
crown, his mother Agatha, and his sisters, the
princesses Margaret and Christian, were em∣barked,
in their return from England to Hun∣gary.
They were overtaken by a storm,
driven on the coast of Scotland, and landed
in the frith of Forth, at a place which to this
day retains the name of St. Margaret's Hope,
so called after princess Margaret, who became
queen to king Malcolm III. called Canmore,
and is well known by the name of St. Mar∣garet.</P>
<P>This Maurice being a man of parts and
merit, was highly esteemed by king Malcolm,
who, to induce him to settle in Scotland, con∣ferred
many favours upon him, and gave him
considerable possessions in the shires of Dun∣barton
<PB N="548" REF="579"/>
and Stirling, particularly the lands of
Roseneath, Cardross, Auchindown, the lands
and parish of Drymen or Drummond, which
last afterwards became the chief title and sir∣name
of the family. He also made him sene∣scal
or steward of Lennox, and assigned him
for his armorial bearing three bars wavy, or
undy, <HI>gules,</HI> in memory of his having been
the happy conductor of her majesty's safe
landing in Scotland.</P>
<P>The queen also bestowed some marks of
her esteem upon him, and, for his good ser∣vices,
gave him one of her maids of honour
in marriage. By her he had a son named,</P>
<P>II. MALCOLM, of whom all the Drum∣monds
in Scotland are descended.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P>III. MAURICE, who succeeded him, and
was father of</P>
<P>IV. JOHN, his heir, who had a son and
successor,</P>
<P>V. Sir MALCOLM DRYMEN, or DRUM∣MOND,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus our historians have deduced their de∣scent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strathallan, Sir George MacKenzie, Hathornden, Bayle, Mar∣tin, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>
without mentioning their marriages.</P>
<P>The following succession is attested by in∣disputable
documents.</P>
<P>This sir Malcolm flourished in the reign of
king William, who succeeded to the crown of
Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165, and died in 1214.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Malcolm Beg Drummond,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Roderick Drummond,</HI> who, in an inqui∣sition
on the division of some lands in Dun∣barton-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox, p. 117.</NOTE>
is designed brother of Malcolm
Beg, <HI>&amp;c. anno</HI> 1234.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. MALCOLM de DRUMMOND, who,
on account of his low stature, was called Beg,
which, in the old Galick language, signifies
short.</P>
<P>Though this Malcolm is the first of the fa∣mily
for whom we have any written docu∣ments,
the situation in which we find him
seems to be a strong confirmation of the tra∣ditional
account already narrated. He is in pos∣session
of all the lands said to have been given
to his predecessors by Malcolm Canmore, is in
high reputation in Scotland, and married a lady
of the very first distinction for birth and for∣tune,
Ada, daughter of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddwin third earl of
Lennox, by Beatrix his spouse, daughter of
Walter lord high steward of Scotland. Cir∣cumstances,
so distinguished, could only agree
with a person descended of ancestors, whose
rank and consequence were established in the
nation.</P>

of St. Andrews, Thomas Randolph earl
of Murray, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. anno</HI> 1323.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Margaret.</HI> They obtained a charter
from Malcolm fourth earl of Lennox, of the
lands of Ardcurane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox, p. 80.</NOTE> <HI>Christianae et Margaretae
de Drummond, filiabus domini Johannis de
Drummond, &amp;c. anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IX. Sir MALCOLM DRUMMOND, <HI>domi∣nus
de eodem.</HI> He made a great figure in the
reign of king Robert Bruce, to whom he was
a firm and steady friend, and immediately af∣ter
the battle of Bannockburn, obtained from
that great prince, for his good and faithful
services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et chart. in ar∣chiv. familiae de Perth.</NOTE> a grant of several lands in Perth∣shire,
<HI>anno</HI> 1315: and perhaps it is no im∣probable
conjecture, that the caltrops were
then first added by way of copartment to his
coat of arms, as they were used on that me∣morable
occasion, with great success, against
the English horse, and very possibly by the
advice or under the direction of sir Malcolm.</P>
<P>The year thereafter, in a full parliament,
where he sat as one of the <HI>barones majores
regni,</HI> he made a resignation into the king's
hands, in favours of sir Malcolm Fleming, fa∣ther
of the first earl of Wigton, of his lands
and barony of Auchindon in Dunbarton-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. etchart▪ in archiv. Ro∣berti I.</NOTE>
upon which lord Fleming got a charter under
the great seal, confirming the same to him,
<HI>anno</HI> 1316.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of sir Patrick Gra∣ham
of Kincardine, ancestor of the duke of
Montrose, by whom he had a son and suc∣cessor,</P>
<P>X. Sir MALCOLM DRUMMOND, <HI>dominus
de eodem,</HI> a man of singular worth and merit.
He was concerned in all the noble efforts
that were made by the loyalists in the mino∣rity
of king David Bruce, in defence of the
liberties of their country; on which account
he suffered many hardships: and about the time
that king Edward of England pretended to
forfeit that loyal subject the earl of Strathearn,
he also gave a grant of several lands belong∣ing
to sir Malcolm Drummond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba∣ronage of England, title Clinton.</NOTE> to sir John
Clinton of England, because sir Malcolm had
been in arms against his lawful sovereign, as
Edward designed himself.</P>
<P>He afterwards got a charter from Malise
earl of Strathearn, of the lands of Culquhalie,
<HI>in comitatu suo de Strathearn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. familiae de Perth.</NOTE> wherein he is
designed <HI>Malcolmus filius Malcolmi Drum∣mond,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We have not been able to discover whom
sir Malcolm married, but he left issue three
sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Maurice,</HI> ancestor of the Drummonds
of Concraig, of whom several considerable
families are descended, who make a good fi∣gure
in Scotland to this day.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Walter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. sir G. MacKenzie, &amp;c.</NOTE> a man of great merit, and in
high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour with king David II. from whom
he got a charter, <HI>Waltero Drummond, nostro∣rum
rotulorum registro, ac a consiliis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Malcolm was either slain at the battle
of Durham, <HI>anno</HI> 1346, or died immediately
thereafter, and was succeeded by his eldest
son,</P>
<P>XI. Sir JOHN DRUMMOND, <HI>dominus de
<PB N="550" REF="581"/>
eodem,</HI> a man of a noble spirit, and highly e∣steemed
by king David, who conferred upon
him the honour of knighthood.</P>
<P>He maintained a long and troublesome con∣troversy
with the house of Menteith, which
proved fatal to several of that noble family,
but was at last compromised by the king's
command, very honourably for sir John. The
arbiters were Robert, lord high steward of
Scotland, and earl of Strathearn, afterwards
king Robert II. the earls of Douglas and An∣gus,
sir Walter Murray of Tullibardine, sir
Archibald Campbell of Lochow, and sir Colin
his son, before the two lords justiciars of
Scotland, sir Robert Erskine, and sir Hugh
Eglington,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv fam. de Perth.</NOTE> who, having met on the banks of
the Forth, passed sentence, to which the par∣ties
seals are appended, 1st of May 1360.</P>
<P>By this indenture he gives up several of
his lands in Dunbarton-shire, on a promise
from the king of other lands of greater va∣lue
in Perth-shire; and, in consequence of
this it was, that he got so large a share of the
Montefex estate: for, having married Mary,
eldest daughter and co-heiress of sir William
de Montesex, justiciar of Scotland, and head
or chief of a great and most antient family,
with her he got the lands and baronies of
Cargill, Stobhall, Kincardin, Auchterarder,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby he became one of the most o∣pulent
subjects in the kingdom, and from this
aera the residence and designation of the fa∣mily
were both changed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>By her he had issue four sons, and four
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Malcolm,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>John,</HI> who carried on the line of
this family.</P>
<P>3. <HI>William,</HI> who married Elizabeth, one
of the daughters and co-heiresses of sir William
Airth of that ilk, with whom he got the
lands of Carnock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of him the Drum∣monds
of Carnock, Hawthornden, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are
descended.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Dougal Drummond,</HI> who was bishop of
Dunblain, but died soon after he was conse∣crated.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Annabella,</HI> a lady of the most
exquisite beauty, and most distinguished me∣rit,
who had the honour of being married to
Robert third king of Scotland. Cambden,
in his account of Strathearn, takes notice of
this marriage, and has these remarkable words;
<Q REND="inline">"The women of the family of Drummond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambden.</NOTE>
for charming beauty and complexion, are
beyond all others, in so much that they
have been most delighted in by the kings,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> It was certainly so with regard to
Annabella; and all our historians agree, that
the beauties of her mind were superior to
those of her body, and that she was the grace
and dignity of that court of which she was
queen, according to these words of another
author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ab regina incolumis aulae dignitas
est sustentata.</HI>"</Q> By him she was mother
of king James I. who, besides his son, king
James II. had six daughters, four whereof
were married to foreign princes.</P>
<P>Sir John Drummond's second daughter,
<HI>Margaret,</HI> married to sir Colin Campbell,
lord of Lochow, ancestor of the duke of Ar∣gyle.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Jean,</HI> married to—Stewart, lord
of Dowallie.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Mary,</HI> married to—MacDonald,
lord of the Isles.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. Sir MALCOLM DRUMMOND, lord
of that ilk. As he was a man of the highest
rank and distinguished merit, he obtained in
marriage a lady of the first quality, and the
greatest fortune in the kingdom, <HI>viz.</HI> lady
Isabel Douglas, only daughter of William first
earl of Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et in archiv. fami∣liae de Perth, et Douglas, &amp;c.</NOTE> by lady Margaret his first la∣dy,
daughter of Donald earl of Marr.</P>
<P>Which lady Isabel, after the death of her
brother Thomas, in her own right, became
countess of Marr, and sir Malcolm was ever
after designed <HI>dominus de Marr.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1385, the king of France sent
40,000 franks to be divided amongst his
faithful allies the Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VII. p. 485.</NOTE> of which sir Malcolm
got 400 <HI>l.</HI> sterling.</P>
<P>He was a man of remarkable courage and
fortitude. He accompanied his brother-in-law,
James earl of Douglas, to the battle of
Otterburn in 1388; and sir Malcolm, in re∣compence
of his gallant behaviour on that oc∣casion,
got a charter from king Robert III.
<HI>dilecto fratri suo Malcolmo de-Drummond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et in archiv. fami∣liae de Perth.</NOTE> <HI>do∣mino
de Marr,</HI> of an annuity of 20 <HI>l.</HI> out of
the customs of Inverness, in satifaction to
him of his third part of the ransom of sir Ralph
Percy, he having greatly contributed to the
taking of that gentleman prisoner.</P>
<P>This great man dying without issue, <HI>anno</HI>
1400, the earldom of Marr remained with
his lady, the countess and heiress thereof, but
he was succeeded in his own great and opu∣lent
estate by his brother,</P>
<P>XII. Sir JOHN DRUMMOND, promiscu∣ously
designed of Cargill and Stobhall. He
was one of the greatest men of his time, and
was justiciar of Scotland, while his elder bro∣ther
was alive. This appears by his pro∣nouncing
sentence in a very remarkable case,
<HI>viz.</HI> sir Alexander Moray of Abercairny and
Ogilvie, having accidentally, and without any
<PB N="551" REF="582"/>
premeditated design,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes Jacobum Mo∣ray de Aber∣cairny.</NOTE> slain a gentleman of the
name of Spalding, he pled his privilege of his
being nearly allied to the clan MacDuff, and
having proven his propinquity, was assoilzied
by sir John Drummond, at a court of justici∣ary
held at Foulis, 10th May 1391.</P>
<P>It does not appear that he meddled in court
affairs during the administration of the dukes
of Albany; but when the ambassadors for
negotiating king James his liberty were ap∣pointed,
he was one of those delegated to
meet his majesty, who was his nephew, at
Durham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. X. p. 309, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1423, and became one of the
hostages for his ransom in 1424.</P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Sinclair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart in ar∣chiv fam. de Perth, and M. S. hist. of the fam. by Craw∣ford.</NOTE> daugh∣ter
of Henry earl of Orkney, by whom he had
three sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert,</HI> who married Barbara, daughter
and heiress of sir John Moubray of Barn∣bougle,
who thereupon was obliged to change
his name to Moubray.</P>
<P>3. <HI>John Drummond,</HI> who settled in the
Madeiras, and was progenitor of several con∣siderable
families, who have flourished with
lustre in the dominions both of the kings of
Spain and Portugal.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir Ar∣chibald
Kinnaird of that ilk, ancestor of lord
Kinnaird.</P>
<P>2.—, married to John Lockhart of
Bar, in the county of Air.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1428, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. Sir WALTER DRUMMOND of that
ilk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> lord of Cargill and Stobhall, who had the
honour of knighthood conferred upon him by
king James II.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter of sir Wil∣liam
Ruthven of that ilk, heretable sheriff of
Perthshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and ancestor of the earls of Gow∣rie,
and by her had three sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Malcolm,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John Drummond,</HI> who was dean of
Dunblain.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Walter</HI> of Liddercrieff, of whom the
Drummonds of Blair, Gairdrum, Newton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are descended.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1455, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIV. Sir MALCOLM DRUMMOND, lord
of that ilk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who, by his charters under the
great seal, appears to have had vast possessions
in lands in the counties of Perth, Dunbarton
and Stirling.</P>
<P>He married Mariota, daughter of sir Da∣vid
Murray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indent. penes ducem de A∣thole.</NOTE> lord of Tullibardin, ancestor of

of sir John Stewart, lord Innermeath and

<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> afterwards lord Drummond.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Walter Drummond,</HI> a man of great parts,
who was first rector of St. Andrews, then
chancellor of the episcopal see of Dunkeld,
dean of Dunblain, and was at last appointed

descended.</P>
<P>5. <HI>William Drummond</HI> of Muthil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>6. <HI>Andrew Drummond,</HI> a clergyman.</P>
<P>Sir Malcolm died <HI>anno</HI> 1470, and was suc∣ceeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. Sir JOHN DRUMMOND, lord of that
ilk, and Stobhall, a man of extraordinary parts
and merit, who made a great figure in the
reigns of king James III. and IV. and was
concerned in most of the public transactions
of his time.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the lords of sessi∣on,
for the administration of justice, <HI>anno</HI> 1471.</P>
<P>He purchased from sir Maurice Drummond
of Concraig,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. Offic. Senesc. et coronat. de Strathearn, &amp;c.</NOTE> the stewarty and coronership
of the earldom of Strathearn, upon which he
got a charter under the great seal, <HI>anno</HI> 1474.</P>
<P>In August 1484, he was, by king James
III. appointed one of the ambassadors extraor∣dinary
to the court of England; and in No∣vember
thereafter, obtained a safe conduct,
<HI>ad tractandum cum rege Angliae, &amp;c.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XII. p. 230, and 251.</NOTE> and a truce
was agreed upon to last for three years.</P>
<P>Sir John, having acquitted himself in his
negociations, greatly to the satisfaction of his
majesty and the whole nation, was, at the next
ensuing parliament, raised to the dignity of
the peerage by the title of lord Drummond,
on the 14th January 1487, according to these
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> <HI>Quo die dominus Johannes Drummond
de Cargill effectus fuit dominus parliamenti,
omni tempore futuro nuncupand. dominus Drum∣mond,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He afterwards got a charter under the great
seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Johanni domino Drummond,</HI> of several
lands, <HI>anno</HI> 1488.</P>
<P>This noble lord was unhappily engaged
with the discontented party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE> against king
James III. after the coronation of James IV.
when the earl of Lennox, in the West, in
the North, and other parts of the kingdom,
the earl marishal, lords Forbes and Lyle, took
arms, and justified their rebellion by the pre∣tence
of revenging the late king's death.
Lord Drummond was sent to stop Lennox's
progress, and prevent him from joining his
friends and confederates; and finding him
<PB N="552" REF="583"/>
encamped at Tillymoss, a few miles above
Stirling, with 2000 men, careless of danger,
and dreading no surprise, he attacked his camp
in the night, with the greatest intrepidity;
the advanced guards were killed, or driven
back, confusion and discord spread through e∣very
quarter, and the whole body in a very
short time, wereall destroyed, taken prisoners,
or dispersed by this spirited enterprise, quash∣ing
a formidable insurrection in the begin∣ning,
giving nerves and strength to the new
established government, and peace and quiet
to the whole nation.</P>
<P>The lord Drummond was appointed one
of the privy council to king James IV. and
justiciar of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1489.</P>
<P>He got many charters under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE>
<HI>Johanni domino Drummond, justiciario Scotiae,
inter</HI> 1490 <HI>et</HI> 1500, and was afterwards made
justice general of all Scotland.</P>
<P>As he had some time before acquired the
lands and barony of Concraig, in Perthshire,
from the above designed Maurice Drummond,
he obtained a licence, under the great seal, to
build a castle and fortalice on these lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et in ar∣chiv. fam. de Perth.</NOTE> and
accordingly built a most noble and stately
castle, and gave it the name of Drummond-castle,
which hath ever since been one of the
chief seats of the family.</P>
<P>He was appointed one of the ambassadors
extraordinary to the court of England, <HI>anno</HI>
1495, and again in 1503, where he is design∣ed
<HI>justiciarius totius regni Scotiae.</HI> He was al∣so
one of the Scotch plenipotentiaries to the
court of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1511, and again in
1513; and was one of the Scotch nobility
who signs the answer of refusal to the king of
England, touching his advice to remove the
duke of Albany from the guardianship of the
young king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XII. p. 557, tom. XIII. p. 305, 346, 551, &amp;c.</NOTE> to which his seal is appended,
4th July 1516. This is the last time we
find him engaged in any public business.</P>
<P>But we cannot omit here to mention one
remarkable occurrence that happened to this
great man in his old age, <HI>viz.</HI> He had given
some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence to the duke of Albany, then re∣gent,
by promoting the marriage of his grand∣son,
the earl of Angus, with Margaret Tudor,
the widow of king James IV. The lord lyon
king at arms was therefore sent to apprehend
him. It seems the lord lyon did not treat
him with that respect that he thought his qua∣lity
deserved, he therefore gave him a box o'
the ear, which was thought a degree of trea∣son,
and was made use of as a handle against
him by his enemies. In short, he was tried
capitally, found guilty, and forfeited, <HI>anno</HI>
1515;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> but in the very next parliament, his
attainder was repealed, and himself restored to
all his estates, honours and dignities, <HI>anno</HI> 1516.</P>
<P>We have many instances of his acts of pie∣ty,
<HI>viz.</HI> he having acquired the lands of Inch∣affrie,
<HI>anno</HI> 1508, founded there a collegiate
church, which he largely endowed with a
revenue sufficient for the maintenance of a
provost, and several prebends, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth Lindsay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Perth, and Crawf. M. S. hist. thereof.</NOTE> daugh∣ter
of David earl of Crawfurd, by whom he
had three sons and five daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Malcolm,</HI> master of Drummond, who
died before his father, unmarried.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> master of Drummond, who
carried on the line of this family.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>John Drummond,</HI> who got from his
father the lands of Innerpeffry, of whom the
Drummonds of Innerpeffry, Riccarton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are descended.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Margaret.</HI> She was greatly
beloved by king James IV. who was contrac∣ted
to her, and would have married her, had
not his counsellors, and the great men of the
state, interposed, and taken her away, to make
room for a daughter of England. She bore
to his majesty, a daughter, lady Margaret
Stewart, married to John lord Gordon, eldest
son and apparent heir of Alexander earl of
Huntly.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Elizabeth Drummond,</HI> married to George
master of Angus, son and apparent heir of
Archibald fifth earl of Angus, to whom she
had a numerous issue. Her grand-daughter,
lady Margaret Douglas, was mother of Henry
lord Darnly, father of king James VI. of
whom the kings of Britain, France, Spain,
Prussia, the emperor of Germany, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> are
descended.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Beatrix Drummond,</HI> married to James
lord Hamilton and earl of Arran, nephew of
king James III.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Annabella Drummond,</HI> married to Wil∣liam
earl of Montrose, ancestor of the duke

<P>5. <HI>Eupheme Drummond,</HI> married to John

<P>They all had issue.</P>
<P>The lord Drummond died in an advanced
age, <HI>anno</HI> 1519.</P>
<P>XVI. WILLIAM master of Drummond,
son and apparent heir of John lord Drum∣mond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Perth.</NOTE>
married lady Isabel Campbell, daugh∣ter
of Colin first earl of Argyle, by whom he
had two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Walter,</HI> also designed master of Drum∣mond.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Andrew,</HI> ancestor of the Drummonds of
Bellyclone.</P>
<P>This William, master of Drummond, was
a man of parts and spirit; but being at vari∣ance
<PB N="551" REF="584"/>
with the Murrays, who had openly de∣fied
him, and had actually gone, in a forcible
manner, to draw teinds on the Drummonds
lands in the parish of Monivaird, he marched
with his followers in order to prevent them,
and being accidentally joined by Duncan
Campbell, captain of Dunstaffnage, who had
come down from Argyle-shire with a party of
his men to revenge the death of his father-in-law,
Drummond of Meuie, whom, with
his two sons, some of the Murrays had late∣ly
killed; upon their approach, the Murrays
fled to the kirk of Monivaird for refuge, whi∣ther
they were also followed by the Drum∣monds
party. The master being satisfied with
driving them off the field, was returning home,
when a shot, fired from the kirk, unluckily
killed one of the Dunstaffnage men, which so
enraged the Highlanders, that they immedi∣ately
set fire to the kirk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. hist. of the family, Strathallan's memoirs.</NOTE> and it being cover∣ed
with heather, was soon consumed to ashes,
and all within it burnt to death.</P>
<P>The master of Drummond was immediate∣ly
apprehended, and sent prisoner to Stirling,
where he was tried; and tho' he pled inno∣cence,
as having no hand in the burning the
church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> yet being head of the party, and no
favourite at court, he was condemned and ex∣ecuted,
<HI>anno</HI> 1511: However, this variance
betwixt the Drummonds and the Murrays
was made up soon thereafter.</P>
<P>XVII. WALTER, eldest son of William
the master, grandson and apparent heir of
John lord Drummond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. penes ducem de Montrose.</NOTE> married lady Eliza∣beth
Graham, daughter of William earl of

4. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to Alexander lord

<P>5. <HI>Anne,</HI> married 1st, to Patrick Barclay
of Towie, and, 2dly, to Andrew Fraser of
Murthil, ancestor of lord Fraser.</P>
<P>They all had issue.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Agnes, daughter and co∣heiress
of John Drummond of Innerpeffry,
by whom he had no issue.</P>
<P>He died before the year 1600, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XX. JAMES, fourth lord Drummond, a
man of extraordinary natural endowments,
improved by a polite and learned education.
After having spent a considerable time in
France, and acquired the easy manners and
address of that elegant nation, he returned
to Britain, where he soon distinguished him∣self
at the court of king James VI. by hi
graceful behaviour, and shining parts. He
was sent ambassador to Philip the III. of Spain,
together with the earl of Nottinghame, lord
high admiral of England, in order to settle
the ratification of the treaty of peace betwixt
the two nations, and to endeavour to recon∣cile
matters betwixt Spain and Holland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in arch. fam. de Perth, haered. masc. quibus∣cunq. Craw∣furd's M. S. p, 123.</NOTE> and
having acquitted himself in that negotiation
with dexterity and success, his majesty, im∣mediately
upon his return, was pleased to dig∣nify
him with the title of earl of Perth, by
patent, to him and his heirs-male whatsom∣ever,
dated 4th March 1605; and got char∣ters
under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Jacobo comiti de
Perth,</HI> of many lands, <HI>inter</HI> 1606 <HI>et</HI> 1609:
But these promising appearances, that portend∣ed
such honour to his family and country,
were soon blasted by an untimely death,
which carried him off in the very bloom of
his years, <HI>anno</HI> 1611.</P>
<P>He married lady Isabel Seton, daughter of
Robert first earl of Winton, by whom he had
only one daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Jane Drummond,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Sutherland.</NOTE> married to John
earl of Sutherland, and had issue.</P>
<P>He having no sons, his estate and honours
devolved upon his brorher,</P>
<P>XX. JOHN, second earl, who got charters
under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Johanni comiti de Perth,
domino Drummond et Stobhall,</HI> of many lands
and baronies, betwixt the years 1612 and
1616.</P>
<P>He was a man of great learning, probity
and integrity, of unshaken loyalty to his prince,
of steady attachment to the interest of his
country, kind and benevolent to his friends,
careful in managing the affairs of his family
with prudence and oeconomy, and singularly
just in all his dealings.</P>
<P>He was one of the peers that sat on the
jury when Patrick earl of Orkney was tried
for treason and rebellion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotiswood's history.</NOTE> who suffered accord∣ingly,
<HI>anno</HI> 1614.</P>
<P>Though this noble lord was appointed a
privy councillor for life, by the parliament in
1641,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parl.</NOTE> yet he was a man of steady loyalty,
and a most faithful subject to the king.</P>
<P>He joined the great Montrose, was taken
prisoner at the battle of Philiphaugh; was,
with his son lord Drummond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthrie's me∣moirs, and Cromwell's act of indem∣nity.</NOTE> fined by Oliver
Cromwell, in the sum of five thousand pounds
sterling, <HI>anno</HI> 1654, and suffered many other
hardships on account of his attachment to the
royal family.</P>
<P>He married lady Jean Ker, eldest daughter
of Robert earl of Roxburgh, by whom he had
four sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Henry,</HI> lord Drummond, who died in
infancy.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> afterwards earl of Perth.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>John Drummond</HI> of Logiealmond,
grand-father of John Drummond, now of Lo∣giealmond,
Esq; and of Dr. Thomas Drum∣mond.</P>

<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Jane,</HI> married to John
earl of Wigton, and had issue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Lilias,</HI> married to James earl of
Tullibardin.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1662, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>XXI. JAMES, third earl of Perth, who, be∣ing
young when the unhappy troubles in king
Charles I.'s reign began, was at first engaged
on the parliament's side, but so soon as Mon∣trose
appeared with the king's commission, he
joined him at the battle of Tippermuir, and
continued steady in his loyalty ever after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's act of indem∣nity.</NOTE> He
was (with his father) fined by Oliver Crom∣well
in five thousand pounds sterling, <HI>anno</HI>
1654, as before observed.</P>
<P>He married lady Anne Gordon, eldest daugh∣ter
of George third marquis of Huntly, by
whom he had two sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> afterwards earl of Melfort, of
whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Anne Drummond,</HI> marri∣ed
to John earl of Errol, lord high constable
of Scotland.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1675, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XXII. JAMES, fourth earl of Perth, a man
of fine natural parts, great probity and ho∣nour;
who having got an education suitable
<PB N="553" REF="586"/>
to his noble birth, became one of the most ac∣complished
men of his time.</P>
<P>He was in great favour with king Charles
II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of council, and commissions in the public register.</NOTE> who appointed him one of his privy coun∣cil,
<HI>anno</HI> 1678, lord justice-general, <HI>anno</HI> 1682,
and lord high chancellor of Scotland, 23d June
1684.</P>
<P>When the duke of York, (afterwards king
James VII.) came to Scotland in 1679, he
contracted a more than ordinary friendship
for the earl of Perth, which subsisted invio∣late
to the end of his days.</P>
<P>Upon his royal highness's accession to the
throne of great Britain, in 1685, he not only
continued the earl of Perth in the chancellor's
office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commission in the public register.</NOTE> but appointed him high sheriff of Mid-Lothian,
and governor of the Bass.</P>
<P>Certain it is no man in Scotland had a
greater share of king James's confidence and
esteem than this noble lord; and it is as cer∣tain
his majesty had not one subject in the
whole kingdom, that served him with more
fidelity and honour.</P>
<P>It is observed by a noble author, that the
administration of justice was never carried
on with more temper and impartiality than
during this period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs.</NOTE></P>
<P>He made a resignation in the king's hands,
of the earldom of Perth, and his whole other
lands, with the heretable offices of the stew∣arty,
coronership and forestry of Strathearn,
Glenerty, and Ballwhidder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in favours
of James lord Drummond, his eldest son, and
the heirs-male procreate, or to be procreate,
of his body; which failing, to the said James
lord Drummond, and his other heirs-male
whatsoever, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereupon he expede a
charter under the great seal, in which their
whole lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family, and chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> lying in the stewarty of Strath∣earn,
are particularly enumerated, dated in
November 1687.</P>
<P>In the same year, when the ancient order
of the thistle was revived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs</NOTE> the lord chancel∣lor
was named the first knight of that or∣der.</P>
<P>At the revolution, when king James went
over to France, the mob begun to commit
great disorders in Scotland. The chancellor
being obnoxious to them, on account of his
religion, was advised by his friends (and in∣deed
it was his own inclination) to follow his
majesty. He accordingly, (with his lady and
family) embarked in a small vessel at Burnt-island,
but was pursued by a long-boat from
Kirkcaldy, full of armed men. His lordship,
being noways provided for such an attack,
was soon forced to surrender. He and his
lady were plundered of all they had by the ruf∣fians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and brought back. The chancellor was
imprisoned in the common tolbooth of Kirk∣caldy,
and most barbarously used.</P>
<P>He was afterwards carried to the castle of
Stirling, where he remained prisoner near four
years, and was at last set at liberty upon his
promising to transport himself beyond seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
without any reason being given for his being
so long confined.</P>
<P>He went first to Rome, where he staid a∣bout
two years, when his old master sent for
him. He came to him at St. Germains in
France, where his majesty heaped all the ho∣nours
and favours upon him that were in his
power to bestow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's M. S. hist. of the fam. and lives of the offic. of state, p. 233.</NOTE> He created him duke of
Perth, (the patent is said to be to his heirs-male,)
first lord of the bed-chamber, knight
of the garter, and chamberlain to the queen.
He also appointed him governor to his son.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Jane Douglas, daugh∣ter
of William marquis of Douglas, by lady
Mary Gordon his second lady, and by her had
issue one son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> lord Drummond,—and two
daughters.</P>
<P>1. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married to William ninth
earl Marishal, and had issue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Lilias, daughter of sir
James Drummond of Machany, countess dow∣ager
of Tullibardin, by whom he had two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Charles,</HI> who died without issue.</P>
<P>He married, 3dly, lady Mary Gordon,
daughter of Lewis marquis of Huntly, by whom
he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> commonly called lord Edward,
who will be mentioned hereafter,—and a
daughter,</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Teresa.</HI></P>
<P>This noble peer died at St. Germains in
May 1716, and was interred in the chapel of
the Scotch college at Paris.</P>
<P>XXIII. JAMES, eldest son of the chancel∣lor,
commonly designed marquis of Drum∣mond,
was educated in France, and improved
his education by travelling into all the coun∣tries
in Europe, where strangers resort to ac∣quire
the knowledge of men and things. His
acquaintance with the most polite courts, gave
him all the easy address and genteel behavi∣our
that distinguish the man of fashion; and
an abundant stock of good natural parts made
him reap the advantages that men of sense on∣ly
can acquire from an intercourse with fo∣reign
nations. He stuck fast to the princi∣ples
of his family, and attached himself firm∣ly
to the house of Stewart. He attended
king James VII. in his expedition to Ireland,
<PB N="554" REF="587"/>
and after the battle of the Boyne, and the total
reduction of that kingdom by king William,
when there seemed no further appearance of
any scheme to bring about his favourite cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. S. history of the family.</NOTE>
he returned to Scotland.</P>
<P>As he was zealous for the honour and in∣dependency
of his country, he opposed the u∣nion
strenuously, as, in his opinion, evidently
tending to destroy both.</P>
<P>It is much for the credit, and shows the
disinterestedness, of this nobleman, that though
he was forward on every occasion, to contri∣bute
every thing, to the utmost of his power,
to bring back the exiled family, and was edu∣cated,
and firmly established in the principles
of the church of Rome, yet when the plot
was carrying on in 1708 to effectuate that re∣storation,
he insists, as a preliminary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hook's nego∣tiations.</NOTE> to se∣cure
to a Protestant people the Protestant re∣ligion,
as well as their civil liberties.</P>
<P>Upon the earl of Marr's insurrection in
1715, the marquis of Drummond was a man
of great consequence in that cause, by the
connections he had with some of the most
considerable chieftains of the clans, and the
trust they reposed in him. Accordingly he
joined the earl with all the force he could
raise, and behaved with great gallantry at the
battle of Dunblain. After that attempt was
disconcerted, and the partizans of the house of
Stewart were entirely dispersed, he made his
escape to France, where he died, and was bu∣ried
near his father, in the chapel of the Scotch
college of Paris.</P>
<P>He married lady Jane, daughter of George
duke of Gordon, by whom he had two sons,
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> commonly called lord John
Drummond.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Mary Drummond.</HI></P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Henriet,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>XXIV. JAMES, eldest son of John marquis
of Drummond, commonly called duke of
Perth, succeededed to the whole estate. He
was sent abroad in his infancy, to be educat∣ed
at the Scotch college of Doway; and, af∣ter
having gone through the course of stu∣dies
usually taught in such seminaries, and ob∣tained
a competent share of academical learn∣ing,
for his further improvement he went to
Paris, where he acquired those exercises and
accomplishments that are necessary for a
young nobleman. He was a good mathema∣tician,
and drew with the accuracy and taste
of a master. About the time of his majori∣ty,
he returned to Scotland, and applied him∣self
entirely to the management of his pri∣vate
affairs, to the encouragement of the li∣beral
as well as the useful arts, to the improve∣ment
of husbandry and the manufactures, not
only upon his own estate, but through the
whole kingdom, wherever his influence ex∣tended,
and thereby became a most excellent
member of civil life. As he had early im∣bibed
all the principles of his family, and de∣voted
himself to the service of the house of
Stewart, so soon as Charles, the young pre∣tender,
arrived, he was amongst the first of
those who joined his standard, with all the
force he could raise. He was his first lieu∣tenant-general
at the battle of Preston, com∣manded
at the siege of Carlisle and Stirling,
and during the whole time of the rebellion,
on every occasion acted with the greatest
courage and conduct, having no other point
in view, but, as far as in him lay, to promote
the good of the cause in which he was em∣barked.
In spite of a very delicate constitu∣tion,
he underwent the greatest of fatigues,
and was the first on every occasion of duty,
where his head or his hands could be of use,
bold as a lion in the field of battle, but ever
merciful in the hour of victory. With an heart
open to all the delicate feelings of humanity,
these mild and gentle affections that peculi∣arly
distinguished the brave, filled his breast
with universal benevolence, made him atten∣tive
to relieve the miseries and calamities of
the distressed, where-ever he found them,
and put him always in remembrance, that
no distinction of party can blot out the cha∣racter
of MAN.</P>
<P>After the battle of Cullodden he embark∣ked
for France; but by this time his consti∣tution
being quite exhausted, with the fa∣tigues
he had undergone, he died in the pas∣sage
upon the 13th day of May 1746. His
body was kept for some days, in expecta∣tion
of making the land, but being detain∣ed
by contrary winds, at last it was obliged
to be buried in the sea.</P>
<P>By an act of parliament it was declared,
that all persons that were concerned in the
rebellion, and did not surrender before the
month of July, should be deemed convicts
for high treason. But as this James died be∣fore
the limited time, the attainder did not
take place against him: however it sell with
all its weight upon his brother and heir lord
John, who was embarked in the same cause,
and in his person the whole estate of Perth
was forfeited to the crown. This John
was educated at Doway, where he very soon
discovered a strong propensity and forward ge∣nius
towards a military life, and accordingly
the bent of his studies were turned that way.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="588"/>
After having acquired some of the accomplish∣ments
necessary for a soldier, he entered into
the service of the king of France; and when
he had passed through several gradations, got
the command of a regiment, which he raised
himself, and was named the Royal Scotch.
He had the same warmth and affection for the
interest of the house of Stewart that his bro∣ther
and father had, and commanded the
French piquets that were sent over in 1745,
in support of that cause. During the time
of the rebellion, he always acted as a good
officer, and his corps was of considerable ad∣vantage
on several occasions to his party. Af∣ter
the defeat at Cullodden, he made his e∣scape
to France in the same ship in which
his brother embarked, and resumed the com∣mand
of his own regiment under the conduct
of Marshal Saxe in Flanders, where he distin∣guished
himself on many occasions, but in none
more than in the care and concern he show∣ed
for any of the British subjects that were
taken prisoners, or in distress. Here he ex∣erted
the generosity of his mind, and display∣ed
that goodness of heart that ever distin∣guishes
true nobility. After the siege of Ber∣gen-op-Zoom,
he was appointed a major-ge∣neral,
when lying ill of a fever, of which he
soon thereafter died, and was buried in the
chapel of the English nuns at Antwerp. He
also leaving no issue, the representation de∣volved
upon his uncle,</P>
<P>Lord John Drummond, before mentioned,
who was eldest son of the chancellor's second
marriage. He had a noble and liberal edu∣cation,
having spent a great part of his young∣er
years in foreign parts, particularly at the
courts of France and Spain. He was master
of a dignity of manners, that claimed the e∣steem
of every body, kind and benevolent to
his friends, affable and polite in his behaviour
to all men, firm and steady in the principles
which he believed right; and though divest∣ed
of an opulent estate, by the attainder of
his nephew, upon an inconsiderable fortune of
his own, he maintained the dignity of his
family, and always appeared on every occasi∣on
in a manner suitable to his rank. He mar∣ried,
1st, the heiress of Balegarno; 2dly, la∣dy
Mary Stewart, daughter of Charles earl
of Traquair, but died without issue at Edin∣burgh,
<HI>anno</HI> 1757, and was buried in the ab∣bay
church of Holyrood-house. The next in
succession was his brother,</P>
<P>Lord Edward Drummond, only son of the
chancellor's third marriage, born in Stir∣ling
castle, during his father's confinement.
He went very early abroad to France, where
he spent the greatest part of his time, and liv∣ed
in a great retirement, being very bookish,
and, in a manner, quite devoted to religious
duties.</P>
<P>He married lady Elizabeth, daughter of
Charles earl of Middleton; but dying with∣out
issue at Paris, <HI>anno</HI> 1760, in him ended
the male-line of the chancellor's body, where∣by
the representation of that most noble and
illustrious family devolves upon James Drum∣mond
of Lundin, grand-son of John earl of
Melfort, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XXII. JOHN, earl of Melfort, was se∣cond
son of James third earl of Perth, and
brother-german to the chancellor.</P>
<P>To the account we have already given of
this noble peer, page 468th of this work,
we must here subjoin, that after the revolu∣tion,
when principle induced him to sacrifice
all, and follow the fortunes of king James
VII. that same address, that same genius, and
acuteness of parts which distinguished him
in Britain, made him admired at the court of
France, and continued him a first favourite
of his unfortunate master. The favourites
of princes are always the objects of envy, and
the voice of slander, and detraction is ever
loud and noisy against them. This Melfort
found from the tongues and pens of many,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's diary.</NOTE>
as much beneath the consideration of the pu∣blick,
as unworthy the nobility and rank of
those who propagated the calumny:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Balcarras's memoirs.</NOTE> As we
dare venture to challenge any person to shew,
from sufficient proof, that he ever betrayed
the interest of his master, or deviated from
these principles of honour and truth for which
his family have always been remarkable.</P>
<P>He married, 1st, Sophia, daughter and sole
heiress of Margaret Lundin of that ilk (heiress
of that antient family) by her husband Ro∣bert
Maitland, second brother of John duke
of Lauderdale, by whom he had two sons,
and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir apparent, who died un∣married.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Robert,</HI> who carried on the line of the
family.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to sir
John Houstoun of that ilk, baronet, and had
issue.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to William
viscount of Strathallan, and had issue.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Mary,</HI> married, 1st, to Walter
Scot of High-Chester; 2dly, to sir James
Sharp, Bart. and had issue to both.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, Eupheme, daughter of
sir Thomas Wallace, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>XXIII. ROBERT, son of John earl of Mel∣fort's
<PB N="556" REF="589"/>
first marriage, succeeding to his mo∣ther's
estate, retained the name of Lundin, as
representative of that most antient and illu∣strious
family.</P>
<P>He married Anne, daughter of sir James
Inglis of Cramond, Bart. by whom he had
two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> of whom afterwards.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1716, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>John, who dying unmarried, <HI>anno</HI> 1735,
was succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>XXIV. JAMES, grand-son and heir of
John earl of Melfort's first marriage.</P>
<P>Upon the death of lord Edward Drum∣mond,
the last male descendant of the chan∣cellor's
body, the representation of that most
noble family devolved upon this James, as be∣fore
observed, who now carries the name of
Drummond, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it being understood,
that the attainder of the lord Drummond,
son of the chancellor, affected himself only,
the chancellor never having been attainted,
and his issue-male being now extinct, this
James (as we are informed) is entitled to the
dignity of the earl of Perth; and as his claim
to the peerage appears to be well founded,
he will no doubt take up all the honours his
ancestors enjoyed.</P>
<P>He married lady Rachel Bruce, daughter
of Thomas seventh earl of Kincardine, by
whom he had issue three sons, and one daugh∣ter.</P>

Adamo de Hope-Pringle, Alano de Laudre,
cum multis aliis.</HI> The charter is without date;
but appears to have been granted about the
year 1387.</P>
<P>It may be here observed, that this noble
family hath always carried the arms of the
earls of Marr quartered with their own,
which denotes their descent from Margaret
heiress and countess of Marr,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 77.</NOTE> as before-noti∣ced.</P>
<P>This sir William was a man of fine natural
parts, which were greatly improved by a li∣beral
education; and he always appeared like
a man of the first rank.</P>
<P>He obtained a safe conduct from king Ri∣chard
II. for himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae, tom. VIII. p. 25.</NOTE> with twenty persons in
his retinue, to go into England, <HI>anno</HI> 1397.</P>
<P>He got another from king Henry IV. to
travel through England, <HI>anno</HI> 1405, in which
he is designed <HI>Willielmus dominus de Drum∣lanrig.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 421. 429.</NOTE>
Also one, <HI>anno</HI> 1406.</P>
<P>He, like many of his brave ancestors, was a
great warrior, and signalized himself upon seve∣ral
occasions against the enemies of his country.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1411, he and Gavin Dunbar, son of
the earl of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extract ex chron. Scot. &amp; Scotch comp. p. 87.</NOTE> with remarkable conduct
and resolution, attacked, retook, and plunder∣ed
the town of Roxburgh, then in the hands
of the English.</P>
<P>He being equally qualified for the cabinet
and the field, was concerned in all the public
state-transactions of his time.</P>
<P>In 1412, the duke of Albany, governor of
Scotland, sent him ambassador to the court of
England, to negotiate the release of king James
I. then their prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae. tom. VIII. p. 703. &amp; ib. p. 735.</NOTE> where he acquitted him∣self
with honour and reputation, tho' his ne∣gotiation
at that time was not attended with
the desired success: however he obtained from
his majesty a charter, all fairly writ with his
own hand, which, for the sake of the curious,
we have here inserted, and is as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"James, through the grace of God, kynge

<P>In 1416, a treaty was set on foot for re∣lieving
the king, which proceeded so far, that
the king of England consented to his coming
to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae, tom. IX. p. 417.</NOTE> provided he should return against
a certain time, or pay the sum of 100,000
merks sterling, and give hostages for the per∣formance.</P>
<P>This sir William of Drumlanrig, with the
earls of Fife, Athole, Buchan, Marr, Douglas,
Crawfurd, the bishops of St. Andrews, Glas∣gow,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were named the hostages as well as
commissioners to bring the treaty to a conclu∣sion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
but for reasons of state even this treaty
did not take effect.</P>
<P>In 1420, the English carried king James
to France, in hopes of drawing the Scotch
auxiliaries over to their interest, by their
king's presence in their army.</P>
<P>Sir William, at this time, intending to wait
on the king in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. X. p. 9.</NOTE> obtained a safe conduct
from king Henry V. of England, for himself
and twenty of his retinue. He arrived in France,
and waited on the king accordingly; but it
does not appear that he or any of the Scots
could be prevailed on to desert their old allies
the French, tho' their king was in the army
against them; well knowing, that if their
royal master had not been a prisoner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, vol. I. p. 254.</NOTE> he would
not have been there on that side.</P>
<P>This great man, being in high favour with
king James I. had the honour of knighthood
conferred upon him at the solemnity of his
majesty's coronation, <HI>anno</HI> 1424; and having
afterwards joined the Scotch auxiliaries in
France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simson's ac∣count of the family of Queensberry.</NOTE> lost his life in the service of that
crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1427, having married Elizabeth,
daughter of sir Robert Stewart of Durisdeer
and Rosythe, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM, second baron of Drumlan∣rig,
who succeeded him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Queensberry. et Rymer's foed.</NOTE> and that same year
was sent an hostage to England (in exchange
of another lord) for payment of the remain∣der
of king James's ransom, but was releived
soon afterwards.</P>
<P>He was a great patriot, and a gallant officer,
having remarkably signalized himself at the
battle of Sark, where the Scotch army ob∣tained
an important victory over the English,
under the command of his cousin the brave

<P>He was likeways engaged in the bold at∣tempt

relieved and brought off Mr. Brysack with the
French forces, then closely besieged by the
English in the castle of Alnwick:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. Vide title Douglas.</NOTE> this was
done in sight of the whole English army,
which was more than double the number of

<P>He married Margaret Carlyle, daughter of

<P>3. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to John lord Cath∣cart.</P>
<P>VII. Sir JAMES DOUGLAS, seventh ba∣ron
of Drumlanrig, succeeded his father. He
was a man of great worth, probity, and ho∣nour,
and a faithful subject both to king James
V. and queen Mary.</P>
<P>In 1526, he was one of the loyalists that
attempted to deliver king James V. from the
earl of Angus, and others of the nobility, who,
it's said, kept his majesty in the condition of
a prisoner; but their attempt was not attend∣ed
with success at that time, which obliged
him to take a remission.</P>
<P>He continued faithful and steady to the in∣terest
of queen Mary, for which the duke of
Chattelherault, then regent, conferred the ho∣nour
of knighthood upon him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer's foed. Angliae.</NOTE> and in 1553,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes ducem de Queensberry.</NOTE>
the queen and the regent were pleased to

He
suppressed several incursions on the borders
with singular prudence and conduct.</P>
<P>When the civil wars broke out in queen
Mary's time, he joined the king's party, whose
interest he always adhered to with great fide∣lity.</P>

<P>He obtained a charter of a great many
lands from king James VI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1586.</P>
<P>He was a man of great judgment and pru∣dence,
and was very instrumental in reconcil∣ing
the differences amongst the contending
parties, which gave great trouble and uneasi∣ness
to king James VI. before his accession to
the crown of England.</P>
<P>He was also very active in suppressing the
insurrections on the borders, which were too
frequent in those days; for all which, and
his steady adherence to the king's interest,
he was in great favour, and highly esteemed
by his majesty.</P>

and learning, was a great favourite of king
James VI. whom he had the honour of enter∣taining
at his house of Drumlanrig, in 1617,
and to whom he continued a faithful, dutiful,
and loyal subject all his reign; and being in
no less favour with king Charles 1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> he was by

of Glencairn, who had raised a great force
for the defence of their country, as they pre∣tended,
surprised him in the mean time▪ car∣ried
him prisoner to Carlyle, and there deli∣vered
him to the governor, who closely con∣fined
him for some time.</P>
<P>After he obtained his liberty, thinking to
be even with the Glencairn men, he obtained
from the king a grant of jurisdiction over
their country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> the ampleit that could be be∣stowed,
but that grant was taken from him
by the parliament 1649.</P>
<P>In 1654. He was again condemned by O∣liver

Lockhart of Carstairs.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1671, and was succeeded by
his eldest son,</P>
<P>XII. WILLIAM, third earl of Queensber∣ry,
who was a man of fine accomplishments,
and great abilities, was highly esteemed by
his majesty king Charles II. who constituted
him one of the lords of his privy council, <HI>an∣no</HI>
1667; and in 1680, by a commission un∣der
the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> he was made justice-gene∣ral
of Scotland.</P>
<P>In his father's lifetime he got two charters
under the great seal, <HI>Willielmo domino de
Drumlanrig,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Queensberry.</NOTE> <HI>domino de Sanquhar, officiorum
vicecomitis de Dumfries, et coronatoris ejusd.
&amp;c.</HI> in 1664 and 1667.</P>
<P>In February 1682, he was created lord
Douglas of Kinmont, Middlebie and Dornock,
viscount of Nith, Torthorald and Ross, earl
of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and marquis of
Queensberry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as a mark of the royal fa∣vour,
on account of his own, and the unsha∣ken
loyalty of his noble progenitors.</P>
<P>In April 1682, he obtained the king's ma∣nuel,
to the lord lyon king at arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 77.</NOTE> ordering
the double tressure to be superadded to his
armorial bearings, as it is in the royal at∣chievement.</P>
<P>In May thereafter, he was constituted lord
high treasurer of Scotland.</P>
<P>In September, he was made constable and
governor of the castle of Edinburgh, and one
of the extraordinary lords of session, holding
at the same time divers military commissions
besides: and indeed there were few great of∣fices
in Scotland, whether sacred, civil, or
military, that, upon every vacancy, were not
left to his disposal during the latter part of
this reign; the king, and his brother the duke
of Albany and York, having delegated to him
almost all their authority in that kingdom.
This is fully instructed by a vast number of
letters from the duke of Albany to this noble
duke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes ducem de Queens∣berry.</NOTE> still preserved in the family.</P>
<P>And that no honour might be wanting
which his prince could bestow, he was crea∣ted
marquis of Dumfries-shire, and duke of
Queensberry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by letters patent, to him and
his male issue, dated 3d November 1684,
and was afterwards made one of the lords of
the privy council in both kingdoms.</P>
<P>Upon king James's accession to the crown,
he was not only continued in his former po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s
by that prince, but was appointed high com∣missioner
to represent his majesty's royal per∣son
<PB N="566" REF="599"/>
in the parliament of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1685;
and he and his son, the earl of Drumlanrig,
were at the same time constituted the king's
lieutenants in the county of Dumfries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In 1686, he was made president of the
council; but as he did not altogether comply
with the measures of these times, but opposed
the project of taking away the penal laws and
test, he was soon after laid entirely aside.</P>
<P>He then retired to his seat at Drumlanrig,
where he lived to the end of his days, in great
splendor and magnificence: he rebuilt his fine
castle there, which, with it's gardens, now
highly improved and finished, yields to none
in Scotland for stateliness and elegance.</P>
<P>He also greatly improved his estate, which
had been much impaired by the loyalty and
sufferings of his father and grand-father, and
the iniquities of these unhappy times.</P>
<P>He married lady Isabel, daughter of Willi∣am
marquis of Douglas, by whom he had
three sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> created earl of March, to
whom he gave a considerable estate in Tweed∣dale.

who died unmarried, <HI>anno</HI> 1693.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to David
earl of Wemyss, and had issue.</P>
<P>The duke dying in 1695, was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIII. JAMES, second duke of Queensberry,
a man of great abilities, and fine accomplish∣ments,
both natural and acquired.</P>
<P>After he had finished the course of his tra∣vels,
king Charles II. immediately upon his
return home, made him one of his privy
council for Scotland, and lieutenant-colonel of
the regiment of horse commanded by general
Graham, afterwards viscount of Dundee, <HI>anno</HI>
1684: which offices he enjoyed till the year
1688, that he was laid aside for not comply∣ing
with the measures of the court.</P>
<P>He came early into the revolution, and was
made colonel of the Scotch horse-guards by
the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>After that prince was declared king, his com∣mission
was renewed, and he was made one of
the lords of the privy-council and exchequer,
and one of the lords of the bed-chamber.</P>
<P>In 1690, king William sent him to com∣mand
a body of troops in Scotland under ge∣neral
Mackay.</P>
<P>In 1692, he was made one of the lords of
the treasury, and in 1693, he had a patent to
sit and vote in parliament as a peer, being then
lord high treasurer of Scotland, and an officer
of state, his father being then alive.</P>
<P>In 1695, he gave up all his military em∣ployments,
was made lord privy seal, and one
of the extraordinary lords of session.</P>
<P>In 1700, he was appointed lord high com∣missioner,
to represent his majesty's royal per∣son
for two sessions of parliament in Scotland.
When he returned to court in 1701, he was
elected a knight of the most noble order of
the garter, and was installed at Windsor on
the 10th July following.</P>
<P>Queen Anne, being sensible that the duke
had served king William with great fidelity,
immediately upon her accession to the throne,
made him secretary of state for Scotland;
and having a great opinion of his abilities and
good conduct, did also constitute him her high
commissioner in 1702, to represent her maje∣sty
in the Scotch parliament; and then being
appointed first commissioner, on the part of
Scotland, to treat of an union between the two
nations, he set out for London accordingly.</P>
<P>The commissioners met at the Cockpit on
22d October; but things not being ripe for
accomplishing the intended union, her majesty
again honoured the duke with the office of
high commissioner to the parliament of Scot∣land,
<HI>anno</HI> 1703.</P>
<P>At first matters went on pretty smoothly;
but after the act of security for the kingdom
of Scotland came to be strongly insisted on,
nothing could be brought to a conclusion that
session, tho' the disputes (which run very high)
were managed with great dexterity by the com∣missioner;
and having passed some useful bills,
he put an end to that session the 6th September.</P>
<P>In 1704, upon a change of some measures
at court, he was removed from all his public
employments; but in July 1705, he was a∣gain
made first commissioner of the treasury,
and lord privy seal, and also restored to his
places in the privy council and exchequer.</P>
<P>In November following, her majesty was
pleased to direct a commission to him to re∣present
her person as sovereign of the noble
order of St. Andrew; by virtue whereof, he,
with the usual solemnity, did invest William
Ker, marquis of Lothian, with the said order.</P>
<P>The English ministry, on account of the
forementioned act of security, thought them∣selves
under a necessity of endeavouring to ef∣fectuate
an union betwixt the two crowns; and
her majesty being impowered, by the parlia∣ment
1705, to nominate commissioners to
treat with those of England, for that purpose,
the duke of Queensberry, now lord privy
seal, was one of the number.</P>
<P>The commissioners of both kingdoms met
accordingly at London in April 1706, and a∣gainst
the 22d day of July thereafter, every
article thereof was by them agreed to.</P>
<P><PB N="567" REF="600"/>
In June the same year, upon his own re∣signation,
he obtained a new diploma, extend∣ing
the titles of duke of Queensberry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to
the heirs of entail of his family, whether male
or female,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes ducem de Queens∣berry.</NOTE> with rank and precedency accord∣ing
to the former diploma in 1684.</P>
<P>The parliament of Scotland being to meet
at Edinburgh on the 3d of September follow∣ing,
his grace the duke of Queensberry was a∣gain
appointed her majesty's high commissioner,
being judged the fittest person in the kingdom
to bring about that great and important work
of the union, which was accordingly brought
to a conclusion (though not without great op∣position)
on 10th January 1707. After which,
the duke was elected one of the sixteen Scotch
peers, in the first British parliament.</P>
<P>Before he arrived at London, he was met
at some miles distance from that great metro∣polis,
by many noblemen and gentlemen in
their coaches, and on horseback; and next
morning waited on the queen at Kensington,
where he found that gracious reception which
his great services had merited.</P>
<P>Her majesty immediately settled on him a
pension of 3000<HI>l.</HI> sterling <HI>per annum</HI> out of
the post office; and, as a further mark of her
royal favour, in May 1708, created him a
peer of Great Britain, by the titles of baron of
Rippon, marquis of Beverly, and duke of Do∣ver;
which honours were to descend to
Charles earl of Solway, then his second son.</P>
<P>In 1710, he was appointed one of the
principal secretaries of state for both king∣doms:
which office he enjoyed as long as he
lived. He was also made joint keeper of the
signet with William lord Dartmouth.</P>
<P>He married Mary Boyle, second daughter of
Charles lord Clifford, eldest son to Richard earl
of Burlington and Cork, by lady Jean Seymour,
daughter to William duke of Somerset, by
whom he had four sons and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>William,</HI> earl of Drumlanrig, born in
1696, who died an infant.</P>
<P>2. <HI>James,</HI> who also died young.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Charles,</HI> earl of Solway, now duke of
Queensberry.</P>
<P>4. Lord <HI>George,</HI> a youth of great hopes, who
died at Paris, in the 24th year of his age.</P>
<P>1st daughter, lady <HI>Isabel,</HI> died unmarried.</P>
<P>2. Lady <HI>Jean,</HI> married to Francis earl of
Dalkeith, and had issue.</P>
<P>3. Lady <HI>Anne,</HI> married to the honourable
William Finch, Esq; brother to the earl of
Winchelsea and Nottingham, his majesty's
ambassador at the Hague, without issue.</P>
<P>The duke died at London on the 6th July
1711, and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>XIV. CHARLES, third duke of Queensber∣ry
and Dover, who, on account of the great
services done to the crown by his father and
ancestors, was created earl of Solway, <HI>anno</HI>
1706, when very young, his elder brother
being then alive.</P>
<P>When he came to be of age, he claimed
his seat in the house of peers, as duke of Do∣ver;
but as, by the articles of the union, 'tis
alledged that no Scotch peer can be made a
British peer, the house of lords therefore set
aside his claim at that time.</P>
<P>This duke was made lord of the bed-cham∣ber
to king George I. was one of the privy
council both to kings George I. and II. and
was appointed vice admiral of Scotland by the
latter. He was also lord of the bed-chamber
to his late royal highness Frederick prince of
Wales, was appointed lord keeper of the great
seal for Scotland; one of the lords of the privy
council to his present majesty; and, upon the
death of the marquis of Tweeddale, in 1762,
was constituted lord justice general of Scotland.</P>
<P>He married lady Catharine Hyde, daughter
of Henry earl of Clarendon and Rochester,
by whom he had two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Henry,</HI> earl of Drumlanrig, who, after fi∣nishing
his studies at Oxford, betook himself
to a military life, and served two campaigns in
the last war, under the earl of Stair, and three
campaigns under the king of Sardinia, where
he gave singular proofs of his military genius,
particularly at the siege of Coni, for which his
Sardinian majesty ordered his ambassador at the
court of Britain to wait on the duke of Queens∣berry,
and return him thanks for the services
his son had done in the course of that war.
He afterwards got the commission of a regi∣ment
in the service of the states of Holland,
consisting of two battalions. He married lady E∣lizabeth
Hope, daughter of John earl of Hope∣ton,
but died soon afterwards, without issue.</P>
<P>The duke's second son, lord <HI>Charles,</HI> after∣wards
earl of Drumlanrig, was chosen member
of parliament for the county of Dumfries, <HI>anno</HI>
1747. Being of a delicate constitution, he
went to Lisbon for his health, and narrowly e∣scaped
in the dreadful earthquake 1755; but
soon thereafter paid the common debt to nature
on his return to Great Britain, dying unmarri∣ed
in the 30th year of his age, <HI>anno</HI> 1756.</P>

<HEAD>MACKAY Lord REAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE progenitors of the house of Mac∣Kay
were settled, and had considerable
possessions in the northern counties of Scot∣land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. and Scotch compend. &amp;c.</NOTE>
as early as the reign of king Alexander
II. who succeeded to the crown, <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>A learned author, who wrote the history
of the earls of Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob. Gor∣don's history, penes com. de Sutherland, p. 35, et 214.</NOTE> in a very elegant
manner, says, that before they had the sir∣name
of MacKay, they were called the clan
Wic-Worgan.</P>
<P>Other authors are of opinion, that one A∣lexander,
son of Ochonacker, came from Ire∣land
to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch comp. and Salmon's abridgement.</NOTE> about the end of the 12th
century, settled in the northern parts, and was
progenitor of the clan MacKay.</P>
<P>The traditional account of the family is,
that Alexander, a younger son of John, first
of the family of Forbes, was the immediate
ancestor of this noble family. This seems
probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family, &amp;c.</NOTE> as in many authentic writs they
are designed MacKay <HI>alias</HI> Forbes, and some∣times
there are Forbeses <HI>alias</HI> MacKay.</P>
<P>We therefore proceed to deduce their de∣scent
from,</P>
<P>I. ALEXANDER, who flourished in the
reign of king Alexander II. and was father of,</P>
<P>II. MAGNUS, who left issue a son and suc∣cessor,
called,</P>
<P>III. MORGAN, whose descendents were
generally called the clan Wic-Worgan.</P>
<P>He lest issue a son,</P>
<P>IV. DONALD, who succeeded him, and
was designed son of Morgan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob. Gor∣don's hist. of Sutherland.</NOTE> son of Mag∣nus,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He lived in the reign of king David Bruce,
and married the daughter of Jye MacNeil-Ghika,
by whom he had a son and successor,</P>
<P>V. JYE MORE, whose son Donald was
called Mack-Jye, (that is the son of Jye)
and from hence he and his posterity assumed
the sirname of MackJye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> afterwards called
Mackie, MacKay, or Macky.</P>
<P>This Jye More made a great figure in the
reign of Robert II. He was proprietor of the
lands of Farre, and several others, in Strath∣naver,
and had many vassals and followers.</P>
<P>This appears from the history of the earls
of Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 35.</NOTE> wherein are these words:
<Q REND="inline">"Nicholas earl of Sutherland had great con∣troversy
with the house and family of Mac∣kie,
chief of the clan Wic-Worgan, in
Strathnaver."</Q> <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These families, it seems, had been at vari∣ance
for some time; and in the beginning of
the reign of king Robert III. there was a meet∣ing
appointed at Dingwall, to accommodate
and make up matters betwixt them. The
earl of Sutherland, Jye More, and Donald
MackJye, his son, met at the time appointed,
but instead of a reconciliation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> a scuslle ensu∣ed,
wherein both Jye More, and his son Do∣nald,
lost their lives, <HI>anno</HI> 1395. However,
this sufficiently shows, that the house of Mac∣kie,
or the clan Wic-Worgan, were very con∣siderable
in the reign of king Robert III.</P>
<P>VI. DONALD MACK'Y, or MACKIE, son
and apparent heir of Jye More, married a
daughter of—MacLeod of Lewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE> by
whom he had four sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Angus,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hutcheon Dou Mackie,</HI> who married,

<P>3.—<HI>Martin,</HI> of whom it is said the
Mackies in Galloway are descended.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Neil Mackie, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And it may be observed, that all these bro∣thers
were brave and gallant men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and often
sought with remarkable courage and intrepi∣dity
against their enemies.</P>
<P>VII. ANGUS MACKIE, eldest son of Do∣nald,
succeeded his father in the lands and ba∣rony
<PB N="569" REF="602"/>
of Farre, and many others in Strathna∣ver,
<HI>anno</HI> 1395.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the 15th century, Do∣nald,
lord of the Isles, having been disappoint∣ed
of the earldom of Ross, to which he
thought he had a good title in right of his
wife, raised a great body of men, and laid
waste all Sutherland, Ross, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Angus Mac∣kie
of Farre raised his Strathnaver men to op∣pose
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 38.</NOTE> They came to an engagement
near Dingwall and a bloody conflict ensued,
but at last Mackie, being overpowered with
numbers, was taken prisoner, <HI>anno</HI> 1410.</P>
<P>The lord of the Isles keeped him confined
for some time; but at last, he not only gave
him his liberty, but bestowed his daughter
upon him in marriage. He brought her home
with him to Strathnaver,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE> and by her he had a
son,</P>
<P><HI>Neil,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter Angus raised a consi∣derable
body of his vassals and followers, and
invaded Caithness, where he committed vast
outrages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and ravaged and spoiled the whole
country, <HI>anno</HI> 1425.</P>
<P>But king James coming to the north coun∣try
in person, <HI>anno</HI> 1426, Mackie threw him∣self
at his majesty's feet, and implored his
mercy, who, out of his innate lenity and good∣ness,
granted him pardon, but took his son,
Neil, an hostage for the father's good behavi∣our.
He confined him in the Bass for some
months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> but set him at liberty <HI>anno</HI> 1427.</P>
<P>Angus died in 1428, and was succeeded by
his son,</P>
<P>VIII. NEIL MACKIE of Farre, who was
no sooner in possession of his estate, than he
raised his men, invaded Caithness, spoiled the
country, had several skirmishes with the in∣habitants,
in which he generally had the bet∣ter,
and then returned home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>He married a daughter of the family of

<P>He had also another son, who was ancestor
of the MacKays in Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>Neil died about the year 1436 or 1437,
and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IX. ANGUS DOU MACKAY of Farre, a
brave soldier.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of king James
II. there happened some variance between the
Keiths and the inhabitants of Caithness. The
Keiths desired the assistance of the MacKays,
which was readily granted. Angus and his
brother John Roy, joined them with a consi∣derable
body of men, and they invaded Caith∣ness.
The Caithness men were apprised of
their coming, and were prepared for them.
The two armies met at a place called Blair-Tannie,
where a cruel fight followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and the
Caithness men were overthrown, chiefly by
the bravery and conduct of Angus, <HI>anno</HI>
1438.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of the family of
MacKenzie, by whom he had three sons and
one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>

<P>In the end of the year 1442, or beginning
of 1443, Angus was burnt to death in the
church of Tarbet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 216.</NOTE> by the Ross men, whom he
had often molested, and was succeeded by his
eldest son,</P>

men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 47.</NOTE> but they being apprised of his coming,
were prepared for him, overcame him, and

<HEAD>ROLLO Lord ROLLO.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Rollo is of very great
antiquity, and appears to be originally
from Denmark, from thence to France, and
from France to Britain.</P>
<P>Fordun, that learned historian, mentions
one Rello,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. I. p. 195.</NOTE> a Dane, a man of rank and figure,
in the reign of king Gregory the Great, who
was crowned at Scoon in the year 875.</P>
<P>The same author afterwards says, that king
Charles III. of France, son-in-law to Edward
the elder, king of England, about the year 900
converted to the Christian faith one Rollo,
a famous general of Normandy (afterwards
called Robert Rollo.) To him he gave his
daughter Gilla in ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riage, and with her the
whole dukedom of Normandy, to be held of
the kings of France, according to the words
of that celebrated author:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 401, and 402.</NOTE> <HI>Normaniam ei de∣dit

<P>He was succeeded in that dukedom by
his eldest son William, who was father of
Richard, father of a second Richard, father of
the famous Robert duke of Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> whose
natural son William conquered and became
king of England, <HI>anno</HI> 1066.</P>
<P>Puffendorf, in his introduction to the hi∣story
of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puffendorf, p. 88.</NOTE> says, <Q REND="inline">"That William the
Conqueror was son of Robert duke of Nor∣mandy,
descended from Rollo, who was of
Danish extraction, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Robert Rollo, the first duke of Normandy,
besides his successor William, had several o∣ther
sons who settled in Normandy, and they
and their posterity retained the sirname of
Rollo.</P>
<P><PB N="572" REF="605"/>
Some of their descendents came over to
England with William the Conqueror, and
being nearly related to that great prince, had
considerable commands in his army.</P>
<P>Richard de Rollo, a son or grand-son of
one of these, came to Scotland in the reign of
king David I. settled in Perth-shire, and was
progenitor of all the Rollos in Scotland.</P>

manor of Elwick, or Ailewick, <HI>Ricardus de
Rollo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extracts from the Cotton li∣brary, penes MacFarlane, p. 98.</NOTE> <HI>Walterus Espec, Petrus de Bruis, &amp;c.</HI>

<P>And he dying soon after his father, was
succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>IV. Sir ARCHIBALD PRIMROSE, who
having got a liberal education, was a man of
great accomplishments, both natural and ac∣quired,
and of singular loyalty, honour and
integrity.</P>
<P><PB N="576" REF="609"/>
He applied himself chiefly to the study of
the laws, in which he became a great profi∣cient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of council, and charta penes comitem de Roseberry.</NOTE>
and being highly esteemed by king
Charles I. for his many eminent qualities,
was, by his majesty, with the approbation of
his whole council, appointed chief clerk of
the privy council, 2d September 1641; and,
by a letter under the king's own hand, was
ordered to transmit to court weekly all the
transactions of the council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> as his father had
done; in which he acquitted himself entirely
to his majesty's satisfaction, till the troubles
in the country rose to such a height, that a
correspondence of that kind was absolutely
impracticable.</P>
<P>As he was a most sincere loyalist, he join∣ed
the marquis of Montrose immediately af∣ter
the battle of Kilsyth, and continued with
him till the unfortunate battle of Philiphangh,
where he was taken prisoner.</P>
<P>He was afterwards tried by the parliament
of St. Andrews for high treason, and was
found guilty, <HI>anno</HI> 1646; but by the inter∣cession
of the marquis of Argyle, and his o∣ther
friends, his life was spared, though he
remained in prison till the marquis of Mon∣trose's
capitulation with the committee of e∣states,
whereby the marquis was obliged to
depart the kingdom, and sir Archibald, with
some others, obtained their liberty.</P>
<P>When the king was a prisoner in the Isle
of Wight, none was more forward in raising
an army for his relief than sir Archibald; and
after the murder of his royal master, he still
persisted in his loyalty, and accompanied king
Charles II. into England, where he was created
a baronet by a royal patent, dated at the camp
of Woodhouse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Roseberry.</NOTE> 1st August 1651; the pre∣amble
whereof runs thus: <Q REND="inline">"In considera∣tion
of the many good and faithful services
performed to us, and our royal father of
blessed memory, in our most special affairs,
by sir Archibald Primrose, clerk to our
privy council; and being desirous to grati∣fy
the deservings of so faithful a servant
with some special mark of our royal fa∣vour,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>After the unfortunate battle of Worcester,
sir Archibald's estate was sequestrated, and he
suffered many other hardships during the u∣surpation,
all which he bore with great firm∣ness
and constancy.</P>
<P>King Charles II. was not forgetful of his
faithful services; but, immediately after the
restoration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> begun to reward him according to
his great merit. He was made lord register
for Scotland in August 1660, and one of the
senators of the college of justice, under the
title of lord Carrington, in which office he
acquitted himself with great probity, judg∣ment,
and candour, for a considerable number
of years.</P>
<P>And as he was a true patriot, and had no∣thing
so much at heart as the interest of his
country, he often opposed the measures of the
court, when he thought they were acting
contrary to it, and joined those lords who
were for the redress of grievances; for which
he, with the duke of Hamilton, the earls of
Dumfries and Kincardin, the lord Cochran,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> were turned out of the council.</P>
<P>But the king was so much convinced of
his loyalty and fidelity, that for a long time
he could not be prevailed upon to deprive him
of the register's place; till at last, sir Archibald
being old and infirm, the king appointed sir
George MacKenzie of Tarbet lord register;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Roseberry.</NOTE>
and at the same time to shew the real esteem
and regard he had for sir Archibald, made him
justice-general in October 1678.</P>
<P>I shall conclude the memoirs of this great
man, with a letter written to him by the earl
of Clarendon, when chancellor of England,
in these words:</P>
<Q><P>"I cannot, my lord, but congratulate you
for the meritorious part you had in restor∣ing
his majesty, and the kingdom of Scot∣land,
to its primitive honour and interest.
I wish the same good spirit may possess you
to the end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Scots comp. p. 339.</NOTE> and with the same success,
while we here shall endeavour to follow
your example, which indeed hath already
been of great use to us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</P></Q>

<P>VII. ARCHIBALD, second viscount Prim∣rose,
was a youth of fine spirit and great hopes:
but dying unmarried, <HI>anno</HI> 1716, his estate
and honours devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>VII. HUGH, third viscount Primrose, a
man of undaunted courage and resolution, and
was a lieutenant-colonel in the army.</P>
<P>He served as a volunteer in the war be∣tween
the emperor and France, under the
imperial general, prince Eugene, and received
a dangerous wound under his ear, in 173—.</P>
<P>In 1740, he married miss Dielincourt,
daughter of the dean of Armagh in Ireland,
and died in 1741, without issue, in the 39th
year of his age, which ended the male-line of
sir William of Carrington, son of the first
marriage of the lord register. And as the
present earl of Roseberry is the next heir-male,
who is descended of Archibald of Dal∣menie,
before mentioned, to him we return.</P>
<P>V. ARCHIBALD PRIMROSE of Dalmenie,
only son of the second marriage of sir Archi∣bald
Primrose of Carrington, lord register of
Scotland, was a man of good natural parts,
which were greatly improved by a liberal e∣ducation,
and travelling.</P>
<P>He served a campaign or two in Hungary;
and, after his return home, lived a retired life
till 1695, that he was chosen member of par∣liament
for the county of Edinburgh, where
he soon displayed his extraordinary talents;
and being highly esteemed by king William,
was raised to the honour of the peerage, by
the title of lord viscount Roseberry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by letters
patent, dated 1st April 1700.</P>
<P>And being in no less favour with her ma∣jesty
queen Anne, he was made one of the
lords of her privy council immediately upon
her accession to the throne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in cancel. haered. masculis ex ejus corpore, quibus defici∣en. haered. faemellis.</NOTE> and was further
dignified with the titles of earl of Roseberry,
viscount Innerkeithing, lord Dalmenie and
Primrose, by letters patent to the heirs-male
of his body; which failing, to the heirs-fe∣male,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> bearing date 10th April 1703.</P>
<P>He was also one of the gentlemen of the
bed-chamber to prince George of Denmark,
with whom he was in great favour, and was
appointed one of the commissioners for the
treaty of union betwixt Scotland and Eng∣land,
which was concluded <HI>anno</HI> 1707.</P>
<P>After which he was chosen one of the six∣teen
peers for Scotland, to the first four parli∣aments

<P>And as Dorothea countess of Roseberry,

<P>2. <HI>John</HI> lord Dalmenie, a man of singular
worth and merit, who very early discovered a
great attention to business, and was remarkable
for his morals and generosity. Upon his be∣coming
of age, and being insormed that no
provision had been made for his mother at her

no provision could be made out of it for young∣er
children of the family, he applied to parli∣ament,
and by his interest obtained an edict
to enable him to provide his mother in a join∣ture

had no issue, and was succeeded in her estate

<P>IX. EUPHEME, countess of Ross, who be∣came
a religieuse, and died without issue; but
having made a resignation of the earldom of
Ross in favours of her uncle John earl of Bu∣chan,
he thereupon added that of earl of Ross
to his other titles.</P>
<P>Donald, lord of the Isles, whose wife was
really heir to the earldom of Ross, thought
the above resignation in favours of the earl of
Buchan, both unjust and injurious; he there∣fore
highly resented it, and claimed that earl∣dom
as his wife's right, even by force of arms.
In consequence whereof, the bloody battle of
Harlaw ensued; but it did not entirely decide
the controversy as to the titles of Ross: how∣ever,
Alexander lord of the Isles, son of this
Donald, afterwards enjoyed the earldom of
Ross, as is fully set forth under the title of
MacDonald lord of the Isles, page 357, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>

<HEAD>ROSS Lord Ross.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Ross is of great antiqui∣ty
in this country. There were seve∣ral
considerable families of that name in the
south, north, and west parts of Scotland, in
very early times, and are said to be descended
from the Rosses of Werk or Hamleck in York∣shire,
who fettled in England in the reign of
William the Conqueror.</P>
<P>The Rosses of Sanquhar in Dumfries-shire,
of Tarbat in Cunningham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrymple's hist. collect.</NOTE> and of Halkhead
in Renfrew-shire, were all considerable fami∣lies
before the reign of king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>Also the Roses of Kilravock, an ancient
and flourishing family in the north of Scotland,
appears to be from the fame stock, as their
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial bearings were originally the same.</P>
<P>In the reign of king William the Lion, who
succeeded to the crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1165,
king John of England sent one Robert de
Ross to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story of the royal family, p. 17.</NOTE> who was well received by
king William, and married a daughter of that
prince, of whom was descended William de
Ross, competitor for the crown.</P>
<P>Sir James Dalrymple, that learned antiqua∣ry,
mentions one Godfridus de Ross, witness
in a charter of Richard de Morville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalrymple's collect. p. 420.</NOTE> constable
of Scotland, to the church of Glasgow, <HI>anno</HI>

composition between the monks of Melrose
and the said Richard de Morville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of orig. writs, penes MacFarlane.</NOTE> who died
<HI>anno</HI> 1189.</P>
<P>The immediate ancestor of this noble fa∣mily,
was,</P>
<P>I. Sir JAMES ROSS, who, in the reign of
the said king William, was proprietor of se∣veral
lands in the shire of Renfrew; in which
county the family have had their chief resi∣dence
ever since.</P>
<P>He made a donation to the monastery of
Paisley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley, penes com de Dun∣donald.</NOTE> of some lands in his village of Stewar∣ton

<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>II. ROBERT de ROSS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Lennox, pe∣nes MacFar∣lane, p. 163.</NOTE> who is witness in a

England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 224.</NOTE> when he went to have a conference

<P>THE traditional accounts of the origin
of this most noble and antient family
are various. Some authors are of opinion,
that the sirname is local, and was assumed by
the proprietors of the lands and barony of
Leslyn, in Aberdeen-shire, as soon as sirnames
began to be used in this country.</P>
<P>Others alledge, that one Bartholomew de
Leslyn, a noble Hungarian, came to Scotland
with queen Margaret about the year 1067:
that he was the son of Walter de Leslyn, who
had assumed his sirname from the castle of
Leslyn in Hungary, where he was born, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Robert Sibbald, Mr. Martin of Cler∣mont,
and other learned antiquaries, deduce
their descent from that</P>
<P>Bartholomew, who, being in great favour
with king Malcolm Canmore, obtained from
that prince grants of several lands in Aber∣deen-shire,
which he called Leslyn, after his
own sirname: that he died in the beginning
of the reign of king David I. leaving issue a
son,</P>
<P>Malcolm de Leslyn, who succeeded him,
and was progenitor of all the Leslies in Scot∣land.</P>
<P>No Scotch sirname has made a greater fi∣gure
in Europe than that of Leslie. We have
now subsisting in Scotland four peers of that
name. There were at one time three gene∣ral
officers of this name to three several crown∣ed
heads, <HI>viz.</HI> Count Walter Leslie to the
emperor of Germany, Alexander earl of Le∣ven
to king Charles I. of Britain, and David
(afterwards lord Newark) to Gustavus Adol∣phus
king of Sweden.</P>
<P>There are at this time several counts of
this name in Germany, besides many conside∣rable
families in France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bayle's dicti∣onary, &amp;c.</NOTE> Muscovy, Poland;
and one of the same name governed the king∣dom
of Hungary as the emperor's vice-roy,
whose daughter he had the honour to marry.</P>
<P>We now proceed to deduce the descent of
this illustrious family by unquestionable au∣thority.</P>
<P>I. BARTHOLF, or BARTHOLOMEW de
LESLYN, was proprietor of the lands and ba∣rony
of Leslyn, in Aberdeen-shire, in the reign
of king William the Lion, who succeeded to
the crown of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1165, and died
in 1214.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>II. MALCOLM de LESLYN, who obtain∣ed
from David earl of Huntington, the king's
brother, a new grant of the lands of Leslyn
in Garioch, which belonged to his father Bar∣tholf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta pene comitem de Rothes.</NOTE>
<HI>sicut perambulatae fuerunt coram A. e∣piscopo

&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This deed is without date; but as A. or
Adam became bishop of Aberdeen, <HI>anno</HI> 1207,
and David earl of Huntington died in 1219,
it must have been granted betwixt the years
1207 and 1219.</P>
<P>Malcolm left issue a son,</P>
<P>III. NORMANNUS de LESLY, <HI>dominus e∣jusdem,</HI>
who succeeded him.</P>
<P>He got a charter from John earl of Hant∣ington
and Chester, confirming his father's
grant, <HI>Normanno filio Malcolmi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>de terris de
Leslyn, sicut charta patris sui inde teslatur.</HI> It

<HI>propter servitium unius militis,</HI> reserv∣ing
a donation of the church of Leslyn to the
abbacy of Lindores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This charter is also without date; but as
John earl of Huntington died <HI>anno</HI> 1237, it
must have been granted in or before that year.</P>
<P>The armorial bearing of this family was
<HI>argent,</HI> on a bend <HI>azure,</HI> three buckles <HI>or.</HI></P>
<P>This Norman, according to sir Robert Sib∣bald,
married a daughter of the lord Lorn, by
whom he had a son and successor,</P>

<P>He was a man of good parts, great honour
and integrity; and though at the first break∣ing
out of the civil war, he joined the cove∣nanters
for the redress of grievances, yet he
was far from being disloyal to the king. He
was first commissioner from the Scots at the
treaty of Rippon, and by his prevailing ad∣dress,
a ratification was concluded, to the satis∣faction
of all well disposed men.</P>
<P>He had a pension of 10,000 <HI>l. per annum</HI>
settled on him for life by parliament, <HI>anno</HI>
1640,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and ratified <HI>anno</HI> 1641; yet the king
was perfectly well satisfied of his sincerity and
good inclinations. When he was at London,
he wrote to the estates at Edinburgh, desiring
them to be more moderate in their measures,
and to do nothing to irritate the king, who
was immediately coming down to Scotland,
and would give them all the satisfaction they
could in justice require or desire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This
letter is written in July 1641,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Minutes of parliament.</NOTE> and he died at
London, in August thereafter, much regreted
by his majesty, who, in his death, sustained
an irreparable loss. A noble author says, <Q REND="inline">"It
is certain the king expected, by his help
and interest, to have found such a party in
Scotland, as would have been more tender
of his honour than they after exprest them∣selves,
and he did always impute the failing

sick at London when the king went for
Scotland, within six weeks after died."</Q></P>
<P>He married,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes com. de Ro∣thes.</NOTE> lady Anne Erskine, daughter

who succeeded him,</P>
<P>XVII. JOHN, seventh earl of Rothes, who
was too young to be engaged on either side,
at the breaking out of the civil war; but he
soon discovered himself to be a man of good
parts, great spirit, and vivacity, and sincerely
attached to the interest of the royal family.</P>
<P>When king Charles II. came over from
Breda to Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1650, the earl imme∣diately
waited on him, was most graciously
received, and had the honour to carry the
sword of state at his majesty's coronation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 224.</NOTE> 1st
January 1651.</P>
<P>When the Scotch parliament at Stirling a∣greed
to raise an army for the king, the earl
of Rothes being now of age, and high sheriff
of Fife, by his interest in that county, got to∣gether
a regiment of horse, and charged on
their head at the battle of Worcester, in 1651.</P>
<P>A noble author tells us, that they made a
brave resistance, and charged the enemy so
vigorously, that they beat back the body that
opposed them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Claren∣don.</NOTE> but were quickly after over∣powered,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This brave young earl had the misfortune
to be taken prisoner, was sent to the tower of
London, where he suffered a long and tedious
confinement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> but at last obtained his liberty,
a year or two before the restoration.</P>
<P>He went over to Breda, and waited on the
king, with whom he was in great favour. He
returned with him to England at the restora∣tion;
and as soon as the ministry for Scot∣land
was settled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commission under the great seal.</NOTE> he was constituted president
of the council, and one of the extraordinary
lords of session.</P>
<P>In the year 1663, he was appointed his
majesty's high commissioner to the parliament
which met at Edinburgh, on the 18th of June
that year, in which many popular and loyal
acts were passed.</P>
<P>They made an offer to the king of 20,000
foot, and 2000 horse, to be ready to march
upon the first orders, with forty days provisi∣ons,
to any part of his majesty's dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 225.</NOTE> to
oppose invasions, suppress insurrections, or for
any other cause in which his authority, power,
or greatness was concerned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the same year also, he was made lord
high treasurer of Scotland, upon the resignati∣on
of his father-in-law, the earl of Crawfurd,
was made captain of the troop of life guards,
and general of the forces.</P>
<P>In the year 1664, he was made lord keep∣er
of the great seal: all which employments
he enjoyed till the year 1667, when he was
made lord high chancellor of the kingdom; in
which great office he continued till the day of
his death.</P>
<P>And having acquitted himself in every sta∣tion
of life entirely to his majesty's satisfacti∣on,
he was pleased further to dignify him with
the titles of duke of Rothes, marquis of Bal∣linbreich,

<P>This noble lord enjoyed many high offices
in the state. He was, by her majesty queen
Anne, appointed lord privy seal, and was elect∣ed

<HEAD>DUKE of ROTHSAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE first who enjoyed the title of duke
in this kingdom, was David, prince of
Scotland, eldest son of king Robert III. by
queen Aunabella Drummond. He was born
<HI>anno</HI> 1378, and created duke of Rothsay, earl
of Athole and Carrick, <HI>anno</HI> 1398.</P>
<P>He was a youth of great resolution and in∣trepidity.
He held out the castle of Edin∣burgh
against a royal army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the royal family, p. 162.</NOTE> commanded by
king Henry IV. of England.</P>
<P>He challenged king Henry to fight him,
with three or four, or a hundred nobles on
each side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to save the blood of his subjects, but
the challenge was not accepted.</P>
<P>He married lady Marjory Douglas, daugh∣ter
of Archibald third earl of Douglas, and
lord of Galloway, but by her he had no is∣sue.</P>
<P>Though this prince wanted neither parts
nor spirits, yet it is certain he gave himself
too much up to a voluptuous life, which gave
his old and virtuous father great vexation.
He therefore ordered him to be confined in the
palace of Falkland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winton, extract. e chron. Scotiae, &amp;c.</NOTE> and narrowly looked af∣ter
by some particular friends, where accord∣ing
to the best and cotemporary authors, he
died of a dysentery, <HI>anno</HI> 1401.</P>
<P>We are sensible it has been alledged, that
this prince was starved to death by the duke
of Albany's means; but as there is good rea∣son
to believe, that that calumny was raised
by the earl of Athole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruddiman's notes on Buchanan.</NOTE> on purpose to asperse
the duke of Albany, and as it is certain the
earl of Douglas, then one of the greatest
men in the kingdom, and brother-in-law to
the duke of Rothsay never resented it, we
think we have followed the best authority.</P>
<P>Ever since this duke's death, the eldest son
of the king of Scotland, is born duke of Roth∣say,
earl of Carrick, and lord of Renfrew,

<HEAD>KER Duke of ROXBURGH.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Ker or Car is of great
antiquity in Scotland, and some are of
opinion that they came originally to this is∣land
from France, where there were several
considerable families, who made a great figure,
even before the tenth century, and whose po∣sterity
are subsisting in that kingdom to this
day.</P>
<P>That one of these, a man of rank and spi∣rit,
came over to England with William the
Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066, had a considerable
command in his army, and having remarkably
distinguished himself for courage and conduct,
got from that great prince a large share of the
conquered lands, particularly in the north of
England, where his posterity still subsists, and
that of him all the Kers in Great Britain are
descended.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the armorial bearing of the
Kers in England and France are the very
same: But at what time the Kers settled first
in Scotland, or whether they came from Eng∣land
or France, cannot now be positively as∣certained:
yet it appears from good authori∣ty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. Rymer's foed. Aug. &amp;c.</NOTE>
that there were several families of that sir∣name
in the west of Scotland, in the reign of
king Alexander III. who succeeded to the
crown <HI>anno</HI> 1249.</P>
<P>Sir George MacKenzie, that learned anti∣quary,
says, that the first of this family, who
settled in the southern parts, was,</P>
<P>I. ROBERT de KER,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir G. Mac∣Kenzie's col∣lections in the lawyers libra∣ry, Edin.</NOTE> who flourished in
the reign of king Robert Bruce, and that of
his son king David, who succeeded to the
crown <HI>anno</HI> 1329.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>II. JOHN KER, who appears to have had
considerable possessions in lands, both in the
counties of Selkirk and Roxburgh, by two o∣riginal
charters, which we have seen, and he
was the undoubted progenitor of this illustri∣ous
family.</P>
<P>Upon the resignation of John de Cope∣land,
there is a charter, <HI>Johanni Ker de fo∣resta
de Selkirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Roxburgh.</NOTE> of all his lands and tenements
in Auldtounburn, with their pertinents, which
formerly belonged to Adam de Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
charter is dated the Monday after the pu∣rification
of the Blessed Virgin, <HI>anno</HI> 1357.</P>
<P>And upon the resignation of William de
Blackdene, of part of the lands of Mow and
Auldtounburn, in the regality of Sprouston, and
shire of Roxburgh, he got another charter,
<HI>Johanni Ker de foresta de Selkirk,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>et Mariotae

after the seast of St. Michael, <HI>anno</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>As he was soon afterwards proprietor of the
whole barony of Auldtounburn, that became
one of the chief titles of his family.</P>
<P>By the said Mariota, he had issue a son,</P>
<P>III. HENRICUS, or HENRY de KER, who
succeeded him, and appears to have been a
man of considerable rank and distinction, for
he obtained letters of safe conduct from king
Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer tom. V. p. 428.</NOTE> for himself, and twelve knights
in his retinue, to pass through England, <HI>&amp;c.
anno</HI> 1363.</P>
<P>He left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>IV. ROBERT, who got a charter from Ar∣chibald
fourth earl of Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes ducem de Roxburgh.</NOTE> <HI>Roberto Ker de
Auldtounburn,</HI> of the lands of Smellholme, and
others, holding blench of the earl, dated 20th

<P>He had issue two sons.</P>

<P>He was retoured heir to his brother Ri∣chard,
<HI>anno</HI> 1428,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and was armour-bearer to

<P>He died before the year 1450, and was
succeeded by his eldest son,</P>

of Auldtounburn and Cessford, who got a
precept from William earl of Douglas, for in∣fefting
him in the lands of Prymside,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and o∣thers,
as heir to his father, dated 19th August
1450.</P>
<P>He was a man of great parts, was highly
esteemed by king James II. and was concern∣ed
in most of the public transactions of his
time.</P>
<P>He accompanied William earl of Douglas
into England, <HI>anno</HI> 1450, for which he got a

in 1451,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom XI. p. 277 and 285.</NOTE> wherein he is designed <HI>Andreas
Ker, dominus de Auldtounburn.</HI></P>
<P>Though he was in strict friendship with the
earls of Douglas, who were superiors of many
of his lands, yet he does not appear to have
been concerned in their rebellion; on the
contrary, immediately after their forfeiture,
we find him employed in negociations of state,
and got all his lands, which formerly held of

<HEAD>RUTHERFOORD Lord RUTHERFOORD.</HEAD>
<P>THE traditional account of the origin of
this most ancient family is, that a man of
distinction, on the borders, having conducted
Ruther king of the Scots safely through the ri∣ver
Tweed, in an expedition against the Britons,
at a place from that event called Rutherfoord,
the king, after the expedition was over, be∣stowed
some lands, contiguous thereto, upon
his faithful conducter, from which his poste∣rity
assumed the name of Ruther-foord, as
soon as sirnames became hereditary in Scotland.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the Rutherfoords have always
been looked upon amongst the most antient
and most powerful families on the borders;
were a race of brave and gallant men, who,
on many occasions, signalized themselves, and
fought valiantly against their enemies, in de∣fence
of the liberties of their country.</P>
<P>There were several considerable families of
this sirname in the south of Scotland, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Rutherfoords of that ilk, of Hunthill, of Ed∣zerston,
of Hundelie, of Nisbet, of Fairny∣toun,
of Fernelie, of Capehope, and many o∣thers;
but the first of them we have found
upon record, is,</P>
<P>I. HUGO de RUTHERFOORD, who is wit∣ness
in a grant by Philip de Valoniis, of the
lands of Terpenhow, in Northumberland, to
Robert de Stuteville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of orig. writs, penes MacFarlane.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in or before 1215,
in which year Philip de Valoniis died.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>II. Sir NICHOL de RUTHERFOORD, who
flourished in the reign of king Alexander III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes eund.</NOTE>
and is mentioned in a charter of that prince,
<HI>anno</HI> 1261.</P>
<P>He is witness also in several donations to
the monastery of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso, penes eund.</NOTE> and is designed <HI>Ni∣cholaus
de Rutherfoord miles,</HI> in the years 1270
and 1272.</P>
<P>He had issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Nichol,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Aymer de Rutherfoord,</HI> who, with many
of his countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. vol. III. p. 655.</NOTE> was compelled to swear
allegiance to king Edward I. of England, <HI>anno</HI>
1296.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>III. Sir NICHOL de RUTHERFOORD, who
appears to have had considerable possessions;
for after king Edward I. had over-run Scot∣land,
we find him swearing fealty to him for
lands lying in different counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 651, &amp;c.</NOTE> and is design∣ed
<HI>Nicholaus de Rutherfoord, chevalier, dominus
Nicholaus de Rutherfoord. &amp;c. anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>He was father of,</P>
<P>IV. Sir ROBERT RUTHERFOORD, de∣signed
<HI>dominus de eodem,</HI> a great patriot, and
steady friend of king Robert Bruce.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barber, Nis∣bet and Craw∣furd.</NOTE> He is
particularly mentioned as a brave and gallant
man in Barber's history of that great prince.</P>
<P>He had issue a son,</P>
<P>V. Sir RICHARD RUTHERFOORD of that
ilk, who succeeded him. He is witness in a
charter granted to the abbacy of Coupar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. penes MacFarlane.</NOTE> and
is designed <HI>Ricardus dominus de Rutherfoord,

monastery of Kelso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Kelso.</NOTE> is designed <HI>Willielmus de

<P>It seems he was afterwards forseited of
part of his lands, though for what reason we

know not; but there is a charter under the
great seal from king Robert II. <HI>Johanni de

king David, in which are these words: <HI>omnes

<P>He had issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. Sir RICHARD RUTHERFOORD of
that ilk, who was in possession of all the e∣states
and dignities of the family.</P>
<P>He made a great figure in the reign of king
Robert III. with whom he was a mighty fa∣vourite.</P>
<P>In a confirmation of that prince, of a char∣ter
of William Turnbull of Minto, <HI>Willielmo

appointed one of the ambassadors extraordi∣nary
to the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VIII. p. 54.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1398, and
managed his negotiation with dexterity and
prudence.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he and his sons were made
wardens of the marches, <HI>anno</HI> 1400, and did
their country signal service in repelling the
insurrections on the borders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 162.</NOTE></P>
<P>He married—Douglas, by whom he
had three sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> his heir.</P>

of the Rutherfoords of Hunthill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> who at last
enjoyed the honours of lord Rutherfoord, as

<P>3. <HI>Nichol Rutherfoord,</HI> who got charters un∣der
the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of the lands of Grubet,
Mackerston, and others, in the years 1426
and 1430. He was ancestor of the Ruther∣foords
of Hundalee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VIII. JAMES RUTHERFOORD of that ilk,
who, together with his brother Nichol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. XI. p. 254.</NOTE> were
appointed guarantees of a treaty with the En∣glish,
<HI>anno</HI> 1449.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great seal, <HI>Ja∣cobo
Rutherfoord de eodem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> of the lands-of
Leithbert, Leithbertsheils, and many others,
in the years 1451 and 1452.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, leaving issue a son
and successor,</P>

2. <HI>Catharine,</HI> married to James Stewart of

the family of Traquair have ever since
continued to quarter the arms of Rutherfoord
with their own.</P>
<P>Philip died before his father, and was suc∣ceeded
by his son,</P>
<P>XI. RICHARD RUTHERFOORD of that
ilk, who was served heir to his grandfather
James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> on 5th May 1499; but he dying
without issue, there happened several disputes,
with regard to the succession to the estate, be∣tween
the heirs-male and the heirs of line.</P>
<P>Thomas, uncle to Richard, served himself
heir-male to him, but Richard's eldest sister,
Helen, reduced that service as heir of line;
and she dying without issue, as before observ∣ed,
sir William Stewart of Traquair, grandson
of Catharine, served himself heir to the said
Helen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his grandmother's sister, and got the
lands of Rutherfoord and Wells confirmed to
him as heir of line; but the lands and barony
of Edzerston remained with the heir-male, <HI>viz.</HI>
Richard, son of the said Thomas, who got a
charter under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of the lands and
barony of Edzerston, on 13th January 1559.
This family still subsists, and they now design
themselves Rutherfoords of that ilk.</P>
<P>The next great branch of this ancient fa∣mily,
is Rutherfoord of Hunthill, descended
from John of Chatto, before mentioned, to
whom we now return.</P>
<P>VIII. JOHN RUTHERFOORD, second son

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XV. Sir THOMAS RUTHERFOORD of
Hunthill, of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>We now proceed to give an account of the
first lord Rutherfoord.</P>
<P>William Rutherfoord of Quarryholes, a ca∣det
of the family of Hunthill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the royal family, p. 176.</NOTE> about the year
1600, married Isabel, daughter of James Stew∣art
of Traquair, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Andrew,</HI> afterwards lord Rutherfoord,—
and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Christian,</HI> married to Robert Durie of
Grange, in the county of Fife, whose de∣scendents
claim the peerage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will be
shown hereafter.</P>
<P>This Andrew betaking himself to a milita∣ry
life, went into the French service, where
he soon obtained the command of a company
of soot. He gave so many testimonies of his
valour and conduct, that he quickly rose to
the rank of a lieutenant general, and acquired
great reputation for his knowledge in the art
of war.</P>
<P>He continued in the French service till the
restoration of king Charles II. He then came
over to England, and having been particularly
recommended to his majesty by the king of
France, he soon became a favourite, and was
raised to the dignity of the peerage of Scot∣land,
by the title of lord Rutherfoord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in pub. archiv.</NOTE> 19th
January 1661.</P>
<P><PB N="600" REF="633"/>
The patent contains many clauses very ho∣nourable
for this great man, but we shall here
narrate only what concerns the dignity and
honours. <HI>Creasse, &amp;c. ipsum Andream Ru∣therfoord,

<P>This lord continued in great favour with
his majesty, and was appointed governour of
Dunkirk. He managed the sale of that im∣portant
place with such dexterity, and so
much to the king's satisfaction, that immedi∣ately
upon his return home, he was created
earl of Teviot, by patent, to the heirs-male
of his body, dated 2d February 1663. <HI>Vide</HI>
that title.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he was appointed governor
of Tangier; and according to the power gi∣ven
him by the crown, in his patent of lord
Rutherfoord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, by his deed of settlement,
duly signed and executed by him at Ports∣mouth
the 23d December 1663, did nominate
and appoint sir Thomas Rutherfoord of Hunt∣hill
to succeed him in his whole estate and
dignity of lord Rutherfoord, to him and his
eldest son; which failing, to his nearest heirs∣male,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This noble lord, immediately after execut∣ing
this deed, went and took possession of his
government at Tangier; and having made a
sharp and bold sally upon the Moors, they
were so well prepared to receive him, that
he and his whole party were cut off on the
3d May 1664;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> and he having no issue, the
honours of Rutherfoord, according to the a∣bove
destination, devolved upon sir Thomas
Rutherfoord of Hunthill, before mentioned,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>XV. Sir THOMAS RUTHERFOORD of
Hunthill, eldest son of John, thus succeeding
to the estate and honours of Rutherfoord, <HI>anno</HI>
1664,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Retour incan∣cellaria.</NOTE> was accordingly served and retoured
heir of tailzie in general and special to lord
Andrew, 16th March 1665, before a jury of
two peers, the lord president, six lords of ses∣sion,
the lord register, king's advocate, three
or four knights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and was second lord Ru∣therfoord.</P>
<P>He got a charter under the great seal, with
a <HI>novo damus, Thomae domino Rutherfoord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and
took his seat in parliament accordingly.</P>
<P>But he dying without male-issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1668,
was succeeded by his brother,</P>
<P>XV. ARCHIBALD, third lord Rutherfoord,
who was served heir-male in special to him,
in his whole lands, titles, and dignities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Retour ibid.</NOTE> on
8th March 1670.</P>
<P>He also sat in parliament as a peer; but
dying without male-issue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1685, the e∣state
and honours devolved upon his brother,</P>
<P>XV. ROBERT, fourth lord Rutherfoord,
who sat as a peer in the parliaments of Scot∣land
till the union,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and thereafter voted at
the elections for the sixteen Scotch peers;
but he dying also without male-issue, <HI>anno</HI>
1724, the honours have been since claimed
by the next collateral heir-male, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Captain John Rutherfoord, lineally de∣scended
from Richard Rutherfoord of Little∣haugh,
before mentioned, to whom we now
return.</P>
<P>XIII. RICHARD RUTHERFOORD of
Littlehaugh, third son of John, called the Cock
of Hunthill, and grand uncle of Thomas the
second lord, was father of,</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN RUTHERFOORD, designed of
Capehope, who had issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Walter,</HI> whose male line is extinct.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>XV. JOHN RUTHERFOORD, second son of
John of Capehope, was designed of Kirkraw.</P>
<P>He had issue a son,</P>
<P>XVI. Captain JOHN RUTHERFOORD, who
claimed the honours of Rutherfoord, as heir-male
to Robert the fourth lord, and was ac∣cordingly
served and retoured heir-male to
him, on 2d September 1737. His connexi∣on
and descent, as above deduced, being ful∣ly
and distinctly proven, before a jury of the
most considerable gentlemen of the county of
Roxburgh, he thereby became fifth lord Ru∣therfoord.</P>
<P>In like manner his son,</P>
<P>XVII. ALEXANDER, who also claims the
same honours, (if his claim is sustained by the
house of peers) will be sixth lord Rutherfoord.</P>
<P>But it must here be observed, that the ho∣nours
of Rutherfoord have also been claimed
<PB N="601" REF="634"/>
by George Durie of Grange, as heir of line
to the patentee, being lineally descended from
Christian, daughter of William Rutherfoord
of Quarryholes, before-mentioned, and sister
german of the first lord Rutherfoord. The
said George therefore served himself heir of
line to the first lord, <HI>anno</HI> 1733: he assumed
the titles of lord Rutherfoord; and that year
voted at an election of a peer without any ob∣jection;
but at the next election in 1734,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Report of the lords of sessi∣on to the house of peers</NOTE>
captain John Rutherfoord having claimed the

in his turn, protested against the said captain
John, and both voted. At the election in
1738, the two claimants renewed their pro∣tests
against each other, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> so that

of the lands of Kirkton-Malar, and a fishing
on the water of Earn, <HI>anno</HI> 1607.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter of sir Wil∣liam
Moncrief of that ilk, by whom he had a
son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> afterwards lord Ruthven,—
and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Mary,</HI> married to George Hay of Naugh∣ton,
and had issue.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to sir David Mac∣Gill
of Rankeillor, and had issue.</P>
<P>He died of the plague, <HI>anno</HI> 1608, and
was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>III. Sir THOMAS RUTHVEN of Freeland,
a man of great parts and spirit.</P>
<P>He was deeply engaged on the parliament's
side during the civil war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parl.</NOTE> and was appointed
one of the commissioners to the treaty of Rip∣pon,
<HI>anno</HI> 1641.</P>
<P>He was made colonel of one of the regi∣ments
that were sent against the earl of Hunt∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guthrie's me∣moirs.</NOTE>
<HI>anno</HI> 1644.</P>
<P>He was one of the committee of estates

one of the colonels for Perth-shire, for
putting the nation in a posture of defence,
after the murder of the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rescinded acts of parlt.</NOTE> and was made
one of the commissioners of exchequer, <HI>anno</HI>
1649.</P>
<P><PB N="602" REF="635"/>
However king Charles II. was so much
convinced of his attachment to the interest of
the royal family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rolls of par∣liament in the public regist.</NOTE> that he was pleased to raise
him to the dignity of the peerage, by the title
of lord Ruthven of Freeland, <HI>anno</HI> 1651.</P>
<P>After the restoration he got a charter un∣der
the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Thomae domino Ruthven,</HI> of
the lands of Forgundenny, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> in 1663.</P>
<P>He married Isabel Balfour, daughter of Ro∣bert
lord Burleigh, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>David,</HI> his heir,—and three daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Anne,</HI> married, 1st, to sir William Cun∣ningham
of Cunninghamhead; 2dly, to Wil∣liam
Cunningham younger of Craigends;
but of her there is now no succession.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who carried on the line of
this family, of whom more afterwards.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Jean,</HI> died without issue.</P>
<P>This lord Ruthven died in an advanced
age, <HI>anno</HI> 1674, and was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>IV. DAVID, second lord Ruthven, who
was in great favour with king William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Martin's collections, vol. II. p. 127.</NOTE> and
was one of the lords of the treasury, but di∣ed
without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1701; and there being
no descednents of his eldest sister Anne, as
before observed, the representation devolved
upon the issue of Elizabeth his second sister,
to whom we now return.</P>
<P>IV. ELIZABETH, second daughter of Tho∣mas
first lord Ruthven, and sister-german of
David the second lord, married sir Francis
Ruthven of Reidcastle, descended of the house
of Gowrie, by whom she had only one sur∣viving
daughter,</P>
<P>V. ISABEL, grand-child of Thomas first
lord Ruthven, who, upon the death of her
uncle David the second lord, and his eldest
sister Anne, without succession, became un∣doubted
representative of this noble family.</P>
<P>She succeeded accordingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penes dom. Ruthven.</NOTE> and had letters
as a baroness to the coronations of both king
George I. and II.</P>
<P>She married colonel James Johnston of
Gratney, a cadet of the most noble family of
Annandale, to whom she had a son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> now lord Ruthven, and a daughter.</P>
<P><HI>Anne,</HI> married, 1st, to Henry Rollo, Esq;
second son of Robert fourth lord Rollo; 2dly,
to Frederick Bruce of Bunzeon, Esq; but hath
no issue.</P>
<P>Isabel baroness of Ruthven died <HI>anno</HI>
1732, and was succeeded by her son,</P>
<P>VI. JAMES, who now enjoys the estate
and honours of lord Ruthven of Freeland, is
the third lord of this family, and hath voted
as a peer at several elections.</P>
<P>The patent was accidentally burnt with the
house of Freeland some years ago, and is
not upon record; but if the honours were to
the heirs general of the patentee's body, this
lord's title to the peerage is indisputable.</P>
<P>And it must be observed, that in the year
1706, when the roll of the Scotch peers was
adjusted for the union parliament, the lord
Ruthven was continued on the roll, though
the male line of the first lord was extinct
some years before. He was ranked, accord∣ing
to his creation, immediately after the lord
Colvile, and before lord Rutherfoord; and
by the articles of the union this was to be
the established and fixed roll <HI>in futuram rei
memoriam, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1739, when the house of peers
gave an order to the lords of session to make
a particular enquiry into the titles of the
Scotch peerage, the roll of 1706 was their
rule; and they found the titles of no less than
twenty-five peers of that roll dubious:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Report of the lords of sessi∣on to the H. of peers, printed in 1740.</NOTE> the
lord Ruthven was none of that number; but
has continued on the rolls in his proper place
uncontraverted to this day.</P>
<P>James, third lord Ruthven, married, 1st,
Janet, daughter of William Nisbet of Dirle∣ton,
Esq; by whom he had two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>James,</HI> master of Ruthven, an officer
in the army.</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> who died unmarried.</P>
<P>He married, 2dly, lady Anne Stewart,
daughter of James earl of Bute, by lady Anne
Campbell, daughter of Archibald duke of Ar∣gyle,
by whom he had two sons, and eight
daughters.</P>

<HEAD>FRASER Lord SALTON.</HEAD>
<P>AS the origin of the great and illustrious
name of Fraser is fully set forth, page
427th of this work, under the title lord Lo∣vat,
we proceed to deduce the descent of this
noble family from,</P>
<P>Sir Alexander Fraser, second son of sir Si∣mon
of Oliver-castle, and brother of that he∣ro
and patriot sir Simon, who had so great a
share of the glory acquired by the Scots near
Roslin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch historians.</NOTE> where they defeated three English ar∣mies
in one day, in the year 1303.</P>
<P>This sir Alexander was one of the greatest
men of his time, was lord high chamberlain
of Scotland in the reign of king Robert Bruce,
and married lady Mary, sister of that great
prince, by whom he had five sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> his heir, who died without
male-issue.</P>
<P>The other sour sons were sir <HI>William, Si∣mon,
James</HI> and <HI>Andrew. Vide</HI> page 429th.</P>
<P>The undoubted ancestor of this noble fa∣mily
was,</P>
<P>I. Sir WILLIAM, son of the above sir A∣lexander,
who obtained from his father the
thanedom of Cowie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> and lands of Assentully,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were confirmed to him by a char∣ter
from king David Bruce.</P>
<P>He also got from the same prince, a confir∣mation-charter
of the lands of Dores,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and o∣thers,
which were the property of his father.</P>
<P>And though there is a full and elegant hi∣storical
account of this noble family, publish∣ed
in the lives of the officers of state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 268, &amp;c.</NOTE> to which
we refer our readers, yet we shall here, by
authentic vouchers, briefly deduce their de∣scent,
with the most remarkable occurrences
that happened in the family.</P>
<P>This sir William was a man of great ho∣nour
and loyalty, and performed many brave
actions in defence of the liberties of his
country, in the minority of his cousin king
David Bruce, with whom he was afterwards
in great favour.</P>
<P>He accompanied him in his unfortunate ex∣pedition
into England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 343.</NOTE> where he lost his life,
and his royal master was taken prisoner at the
battle of Durham, <HI>anno</HI> 1346.</P>
<P>By a lady of the family of Douglas, he
left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>John,</HI> who got a charter under the great

<P>Sir William was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>II. Sir ALEXANDER FRASER, designed
thane of Cowie, afterwards of Philorth, who
being young at his father's death, we find
little mention made of him till after the year
1360.</P>
<P>He first got charters of confirmation from
king David Bruce, of the whole thanedom of
Cowie. He then got the lands of Dores e∣rected
into one free barony, by a charter from
the same prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in which he is designed <HI>di∣lectus
consanguineus suus,</HI> dated the 40th year

<P>This sir Alexander was also a man of great
parts and merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Haddington's collections, p. 120.</NOTE> and highly esteemed by king
Robert II. who appointed him high sheriff of
Aberdeen.</P>
<P>He remarkably signalized himself at the
battle of Otterburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Froissart, and lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> where the brave earl of
Douglas their general was slain, <HI>anno</HI> 1388.</P>
<P>He married lady Johanna, second daughter
of William earl of Ross, with whom he got
the lands and barony of Philorth, which af∣terwards
became one of the chief titles of his
family.</P>

<HEAD>MACKENZIE Earl of SEAFORTH.</HEAD>
<P>ALL our historians agree, that the imme∣diate
ancestor of this illustrious family
was from Ireland, being a son of the Geralds
or Fitzgerald, earls of Desmonds, Kildare,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> one of the most considerable and power∣ful
families in that kingdom.</P>
<P>He was called Calinus, and, upon some dis∣content,
having left his own country, came to
Scotland about the year 1261, with a consi∣derable
number of his friends and followers.
He and his retinue were kindly received by
king Alexander III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac∣Kenzie, Aber∣crombie, Crawfurd, &amp;c.</NOTE> and he served him faith∣ully
as long as he lived.</P>
<P>About two years after his arrival, Haco king
of Norway invaded Scotland with a powerful
fleet and army, with which he landed in the
shire of Air.</P>
<P>King Alexander immediately marched
against him, and was joined by this brave
stranger and his followers: they soon came
to an engagement, and king Alexander obtain∣ed
a complete victory over king Haco at Largis
in Cunningham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch hi∣storians.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1263.</P>
<P>In this action the gallant Calinus acquired
great glory and reputation, by his conduct
and intrepidity, and became a mighty favour∣ite
of king Alexander, who, to encourage

and in reward of his great merit and faithful
services (as the charter bears) made him a
grant of the whole lands of Kintail in Inver∣ness-shire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chiv. familiae de Seaforth.</NOTE>
erected into a free barony to him
and his heirs for ever, by his royal charter,
dated 9th January 1266. From him there∣fore
we proceed to deduce the descent of this
noble family.</P>
<P>I. CALINUS or CALIN, first baron of
Kintail, having been naturalized by king A∣lexander
III. as before observed, was much
about that prince's court; and having, at a
hunting match, with an arrow, killed a stag,
that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac∣Kenzie's hist. of this fami∣ly, p. 31.</NOTE> in full career, was making towards the
king; his majesty, on that account, assigned
ed him a stag's head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for his armorial
bearing.</P>
<P>He was a man of good parts, and took great
pains to make himself agreeable to the inha∣bitants
of that part of the country where he
resided, and became greatly beloved and e∣steemed.</P>
<P>According to doctor George MacKenzie,
who has wrote a full and elaborate history of
this noble family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. I. p. 32.</NOTE> he married a daughter of
Walter lord high steward of Scotland, by
whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Kenneth,</HI> who succeeded him.</P>
<P>He died at his castle of Island-Donan, and
was buried in the famous monastery of Icolm∣kill,
<HI>anno</HI> 1278.</P>
<P>II. KENNETH, second baron of Kintail,
being a man of great affability and benevo∣lence,
became very popular in the northern
parts; but what part he acted during the dis∣putes
betwixt the Bruce and the Baliol, our
historians are silent.</P>
<P>He married Morba MacDowal, daughter
of Alexander lord of Lorn;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and dying <HI>anno</HI>
1304, by her he left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>III. KENNETH, third baron of Kintail, who
in the Galic (the language then used) was
called Kenneth MacKenneth, or the son of
Kenneth. This in English came to be call∣ed
MacKenny or MacKenzie, and from him
all the MacKenzies in Scotland are descended.</P>
<P>He was a great loyalist, and a firm friend
of king Robert Bruce.</P>

in the greatest distress, before he was settled
on the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Mac∣Kenzie's his<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vol. I.</NOTE> and behaved gallantly at the

of Kintail, who succeeded him, and mar∣ried

<P>He had also a natural son called Murdoch
Reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> a brave and gallant man, of whom se∣veral
families of the name of MacKenzie are
descended.</P>
<P>This Kenneth, at the instigation of the earl
of Ross, was murdered at Perth, in the slow∣er
of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> when he was going to join king
David Bruce, in his expedition into England,
<HI>anno</HI> 1346.</P>

Dow, or Black Murdoch.</P>

<HEAD>SINCLAIR Lord SINCLAIR.</HEAD>
<P>AS the origin of the great and illustrious
name of Sinclair, is to be found under
the title of Sinclair earl of Orkney, page
529th of this work, we proceed to deduce
the descent of this noble family from their
immediate ancestor,</P>
<P>William third earl of Orkney, who was
also earl of Caithness. He lived in the reigns
of king James I. II. and III. and had to his
first wife lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of
Archibald fourth earl of Douglas, by lady
Margaret Stewart, daughter of king Robert
III. By her he had one son,</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> the first of this family,—and
a daughter,</P>

duke of Albany.</P>

<P>I. WILLIAM, eldest son of William earl
of Orkney, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Though he did not succeed to his father in
his titles of honour, yet we have undoubt∣ed
proof of his being his eldest son, and he
certainly obtained considerable possessions in

<P>THE Somervilles are of Norman extrac∣tion,
and came over to Britain with
William the Conqueror, <HI>anno</HI> 1066.</P>
<P>The rank they bore in Normandy intitled
them to the highest regard of their prince;
the considerable commands they had in the
army, and their gallant behaviour in England,
gave them a just claim to a share of the con∣quests
of that country; and accordingly,</P>
<P>I. Sir GUALTER, or WALTER de SO∣MERVILLE,
obtained from the Conqueror,
<PB N="624" REF="657"/>
(having been one of his chief commanders)
the whole lordship and territory of Whitch∣nour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roll of Battle Abbay, du Moulin's hist. of Normandy, and Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE>
in the county of Stafford, where he set∣tled,
as also Somerville Aston in Glocester∣shire.
He was progenitor of all the Somer∣villes
in Great Britain.</P>
<P>He lived after the year 1100, and left issue
several sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Walter de Somerville,</HI> who succeed∣ed
him in the lordship of Whitchnour, and
carried on the line of that great and opulent
family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba∣ronage.</NOTE> which flourished with lustre in England
for many ages. He lived in the reigns of
king Henry I. and king Stephen, and of him
was lineally descended sir Philip de Somerville,
lord of Whitchnour, who made a considerable
figure in the reigns of kings Henry IV. and V.
and was so famous for his great hospitality, that
he is recorded for having given a flitch of ba∣con
as a reward to any husband and wife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Addison's works.</NOTE> who
could say that they never had the least diffe∣rence,
nor contradicted one another within
the space of twelve months after marriage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The figure of a flitch of bacon, neatly
carved on wood, is at this day in Whitchnour
house, near Litchfield, now the seat of—
Offby, Esq; but the male line of the Whitch∣nour
family is long since extinct, having end∣ed
in a single daughter, married to the great
Stafford duke of Buckingham, constable of
England, forfeited and beheaded in Henry the
VIII's time.</P>
<P>Sir Gualter's second son was,</P>
<P>2. <HI>William,</HI> of whom all the Somervilles
in Scotland are descended, as will be shown
hereafter.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Roger,</HI> who got from his father the ba∣tony
of Aston in Glocestershire, which, after
him, was called Somerville Aston, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir John of Somerville-Aston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdal. hist. of Warwick∣shire, and Ar∣cher's hist. of Glostershire.</NOTE> son or
grandson of Roger, flourished in the reign of
king Henry III. and married Cecilia de Limefie,
with whom he got the manor of Stockton,
and several other considerable possessions in
Warwick-shire.</P>
<P>Sir William of Somerville-Aston lineally
descended of the above sir John, about the
year 1607, married Elizabeth, daughter of sir
Humphry Ferrers, descended of William lord

in Glocester-shire, who was author of that
celebrated poem called the Chace, was his li∣neal
heir; but having no issue, and desiring
to continue his estate in this antient family,
in the year 1730, concluded a bargain with
the present lord Somerville, for the reversion
of his estates at his death, which took place
in the year 1742, and since his accession
thereto, he hath greatly improved and beau∣tified
it.</P>
<P>We now return to the progenitor of the
Somervilles in Scotland.</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM de SOMERVILLE, second
son of the first sir Gualter, having contracted
a friendship with king David I. when in Eng∣land,
came with him to Scotland, and being
highly esteemed, and in great favour with
that prince, he bestowed upon him the lands
and barony of Carnwath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p 79.</NOTE> in the county of

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1103, and was succeeded by

<P>X. Sir THOMAS de SOMERVILLE, who
succeeded also to his uncle Thomas's estates
of Gilmerton, Drum, and Goodtrees, and was
the first lord Somerville.</P>
<P>He was a man of great honour and virtue,

<P>He made a donation to the monastery of
Lesmahagoe, to which William Somerville his
brother was a witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1421; and it
was afterwards confirmed by king James I.
<HI>anno</HI> 1427.</P>
<P>He made another mortification out of his
lands of Manuel, for a chaplain to the same
monastery, with consent of William Somer∣ville

<P>He was one of the commissioners sent to

return home the year thereafter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> X. p. 308.</NOTE> he was cal∣led
to parliament by his majesty, as a lord ba∣ron,

<P>He was one of the sureties for a seven

<P>As therefore there is sufficient proof that
lord Somerville was a lord of parliamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
the year 1424, he appears to be the first lord
baron of Scotland; and by a resolution of the

this lord, there is a saving clause, that, upon
application to that house at any time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records or parliament</NOTE> and

with king James V. who did him the
honour to be frequently (with his whole re∣tinue)
at his house of Cowthaly, (called, by
king James V. in a jocular way, Cowdaily,
because he observed a cow and ten sheep kil∣led
every day,) for several days together,
which put this noble lord to such extraordi∣nary
expence, that he greatly incumbered his
vast estate; for though none of the nobility
had a greater share of the king's favour than
this lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memoirs of the family of Somerville.</NOTE> yet he never accepted of any place
or pension from the government, and conti∣nued
a most faithful and loyal subject to the
end of his days.</P>
<P>In the year 1542, he accompanied the king
in his unfortunate expedition to Solway,

court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stow's chron.</NOTE> and confined; but he and

friendship with king Henry VIII. became en∣tirely
of his party, and an enemy to the
French interest.</P>

Mary queen of Scts, and prince Ed∣ward
of England, believing it might turn to
the advantage of his country; but it never
took effect, though king Henry had it very
much at heart.</P>
<P>He got three charters under the great seal,

<P>V. DUTHACUS de CARNEGIE, made a

<P>He acquired the lands of Kinnaird in An∣gus

<P><PB N="632" REF="665"/>
The castle and barony of Kinnaird after∣wards
became their chief residence, and the

<P>He was killed at the battle of Harlaw, <HI>an∣no</HI>

<P>VI. WALTER CARNEGIE, who succeed∣ed
him, and was promiscuously designed of
Kinnaird, and of that ilk.</P>
<P>He was a man of great spirit, courage and
resolution, but had the misfortune to be en∣gaged
in the Douglases rebellion, and was with
the earl of Crawfurd at the battle of Brechin,
where the earl of Huntly obtained a remark∣able
victory over the rebels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's col∣lections, vol. I. p. 331.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1452; af∣ter
which his house of Kinnaird was burnt by
order of the earl of Huntly, and all their an∣tient
writs consumed, which is the reason of
their being so few documents extant of the an∣cestors
of this noble family.</P>
<P>Here we have taken the liberty to differ
from Mr. Crawford, who says, that this Wal∣ter
joined the earl of Huntly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have

which gave great satisfaction to the whole na∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>DALRYMPLE Earl of STAIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Dalrymple is local, and
of great antiquity in the west of Scot∣land.
It was assumed by the possessors of the
lands and barony of Dalrymple, in the county
of Air, as soon as sirnames became hereditary
in this country.</P>
<P>I. ADAM de DALRYMPLE flourished in
the reign of king Alexander III. who suc∣ceeded

<P>He married Agnes Kennedy, heiress of
Stair, with whom he got that barony, which
afterwards became the chief title of his fami∣ly;
but they being within the degrees of
consanguinity, forbidden by the church, there
was a dispensation obtained from archbishop

<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1625, and by the said Janet,
a daughter of Fergus Kennedy of Knockdaw,
he left issue a son and successor,</P>
<P>XII. JAMES, seventh baron, afterwards
viscount Stair, born 1619, who studied at the
college of Glasgow was a fine scholar, and
passed all the regular degrees of learning at
that university.</P>
<P>When the civil war broke out in the reign
of king Charles I. he accepted of a captain's
commission from the parliament in the earl of
Glencairn's regiment; but it does not appear
that he did any thing remarkable in that ser∣vice.</P>
<P>He was a man of great parts and know∣ledge,
applied himself chiefly to the study of
the laws, and became most eminent in that
profession.</P>
<P>In the year 1649, when the estates of the
nation sent commissioners to Breda, to invite
king Charles II. to come to Scotland, and
take possession of his just right, the baron of
Stair was appointed secretary to that embas∣sy,
and acquitted himself so much to his ma∣jesty's
satisfaction, that he held him in high
esteem ever after.</P>
<P>He arrived in Scotland with the commis∣sioners,
before the king; and upon his maje∣sty's
landing in 1650, he immediately waited
upon him, was most graciously received, and
contributed all that lay in his power to raise
forces for his majesty's service, which, after
the fatal battle or Worcester, were dispersed.</P>
<P>The baron of Stair continued his practice
at the bar with great reputation; but never
could be prevailed on to take any oaths to
the goverment during the usurpation, though
he had great offers made him.</P>
<P>As the brevity of this work will not per∣mit
us to give a full account of all the trans∣actions
of this great man's life, we shall on∣ly
briefly mention some of the most remark∣able
occurences, and refer our readers to Mr.
Crawfurd's peerage, page 453, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the restoration of king Charles II.
he went to London with the earl of Cassilis,
a great loyalist, to congratulate his majesty
upon that happy event. The king, having
a great opinion of his abilities, first conferred
the honour of knighthood upon him, then
appointed him one of the senators of the col∣lege
of justice in the beginning of 1661;
and in November thereafter, upon sir John
Gilmour the lord president's being called up
to London, he was constituted vice-president
during his absence.</P>
<P>In the year 1664, the king, as a further
mark of his royal favour, created him a knight
baronet, by patent to him and the heirs-male
of his body for ever.</P>
<P>He afterwards got a charter under the great
seal, <HI>domino Johanni Dalrymple de Stair, mi∣liti
baronetto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub archiv.</NOTE> of the lands and barony of
Stair, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> dated the 15th day of Febru∣ary
1669.</P>
<P>In the year 1671, he was appointed lord
president of the session, in which high office
he discharged his duty with great sufficiency,
knowledge, and integrity.</P>
<P>As the lord president did not approve of
all the measures of the court towards the end
of king Charles II.'s reign, he spoke his mind
very freely in parliament; and having ma∣ny
enemies in the ministry, was removed
from all his offices, <HI>anno</HI> 1682. He thereup∣on
retired to Holland, where he remained till
the year 1688, when he came over with the
prince of Orange, with whom he was in great
favour; and who was no sooner settled on the
throne, than he restored him to his office of
lord president of the session, <HI>anno</HI> 1689, and
raised him to the dignity of the peerage, by
the title of viscount Stair, lord Glenluce and
Stranrawer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cellaria.</NOTE> by patent to him and the heirs∣male
of his body, dated at Kensington, 1st
April 1690.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter of James
Ross of Balneil, by whom he got a great ac∣cession
to his estate in lands; and in conse∣quence
thereof the family ever since continu∣ed
to quarter the arms of Ross with their
own. By her he had issue five sons, and four
daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> afterwards earl of Stair.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>James Dalrymple</HI> of Borthwick, ba∣ronet,
one of the principal clerks of session, a
man of great merit, learning, and knowledge,
and one of the best antiquaries of his time,
which the works he has published sufficiently
testify. He married and had issue.</P>
<P>3. Sir <HI>Hugh Dalrymple</HI> of North-Berwick,
Bart. a man of great abilities and knowledge
in our laws, and was long lord president of
the session. He also married and had issue.</P>
<P>4. Doctor <HI>Thomas Dalrymple,</HI> physician
in ordinary to the king for Scotland.</P>
<P>5. Sir <HI>David Dalrymple</HI> of Hailes, Bart. also
an eminent lawier, who was lord advocate in
the reigns of queen Anne, and king George I.
He also married and had issue.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Janet,</HI> married to David, son
<PB N="639" REF="672"/>
and apparent heir of sir David Dunbar of Bal∣doon,
Bart. but died without issue.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> married to Alan, seventh
lord Cathcart.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Sarah,</HI> married to Charles lord Crich∣ton,
son and apparent heir of William earl of
Dumfries.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Isabel,</HI> married to sir David Cunning∣ham
of Millcraig, Bart. The last three had issue.</P>
<P>The viscount died in the 76th year of his
age, <HI>anno</HI> 1695, and was succeeded by his el∣dest
son,</P>
<P>XIII. JOHN, second viscount Stair, who
was also bred to the law, and acquired great
knowledge in that profession.</P>
<P>He was a man of fine parts, and great abi∣lities,
was appointed advocate by king James
VII. <HI>anno</HI> 1686, and afterwards lord justice-clerk
by the same prince.</P>
<P>He went early and most zealously into the
revolution, and at the convention of estates in
1689, he expressed a great desire that a trea∣ty
of union might be set on foot between the
two nations, which afterwards he had a great
hand in accomplishing; and as he had been
very instrumental in getting the crown de∣clared
vacant by the convention, he was one
of the commissioners appointed to make an of∣fer
thereof to the prince and princess of O∣range,
in the same year, 1689.</P>
<P>He was, by their majesties, appointed lord
advocate for Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1690; and the
year thereafter was constituted one of the
principal secretaries of state. As the massacre
of Glencoe happened while he was in that of∣fice,
the parliament begun to make some en∣quiry
into the authors of it, in the year 1695;
and no doubt he was able to justify himself:
for as the orders for that bloody tragedy were
generally believed to have proceeded from a
higher power, the affair was immediately
dropped; but the secretary was laid aside for
the time.</P>
<P>Upon queen Anne's accession to the crown,
he was nominated one of her privy council;
and, as a testimony of her majesty's favour
and esteem, he was further dignified with the
titles of earl of Stair, viscount Dalrymple,
lord Newliston, Glenluce, and Stranrawer, by
patent to the heirs-male of his body; which
failing, to the heirs-male of the body of the
deceast James viscount Stair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in cancellaria.</NOTE> his father, dated
8th April 1703.</P>
<P>He was named one of the commissioners
for the treaty of union, of which he was a
most sincere and servent promoter; but he
died of an apoplexy just before it was com∣pleated,
on 8th January 1706-7, in the 59th
year of his age.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress
of sir John Dundas of Newliston, in conse∣quence
whereof he quartered the arms of
Dundas with his own, and by her had issue
three sons, and one daughter.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Colonel <HI>William Dalrymple</HI> of Glen∣mure,
of whom more afterwards.</P>
<P>3. <HI>George,</HI> one of the barons of exchequer,
who married a daughter of sir Andrew Myr∣ton
of Gogar; and dying <HI>anno</HI> 1745, left issue
a son, captain John Dalrymple, who married
miss Middleton.</P>
<P>His daughter, lady <HI>Margaret Dalrymple;</HI>
was married to Hugh third earl of Loudoun.</P>
<P>XIV. JOHN, second earl of Stair, succeed∣ed
his father in January 1707, and was in
his stead appointed one of the commissioners
to finish the treaty of union betwixt the two
nations.</P>
<P>He had a liberal education, was a man of
great integrity, and good parts, both natural
and acquired.</P>
<P>He gave early proofs of his having an ex∣traordinary
military genius. In 1702, he was
appointed lieutenant-colonel to the third re∣giment
of guards, and served as a volunteer
in Flanders, under the duke of Marlborough,
where he remarkably distinguished himself,
particularly at the taking of Venlo and Liege.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter he was made aide-de-camp
to that great general; and colonel of the royal
Scotch dragoons.</P>
<P>He commanded a brigade of soot at the
battle of Ramellies. In 1706, he was made
a brigadier, and served in that post at the
battle of Audenard, and brought the news of
that victory to England, <HI>anno</HI> 1708.</P>
<P>He was elected one of the sixteen Scotch
peers to the first parliament of Great-Britain,
and was re-elected to the fifth, sixth, and se∣venth.</P>
<P>In 1709, he commanded as a major-gene∣ral
at the taking of Tanier, and as a lieute∣nant-general
at the taking of Doway, <HI>anno</HI>
1710, in which year he was, by a special or∣der
from queen Anne, invested with the most
noble order of the thistle.</P>
<P>In the end of the queen's reign, he not
coming into the measures of the court, was
laid aside, and sold his regiment to the earl of
Portmore; but upon the accession of king
George I. to the throne, he was named one
of his privy council, was appointed one of
the lords of his bed-chamber, and was restor∣ed
to his regiment of dragoons.</P>
<P>And being no less an able statesman than a
good soldier, he was sent ambassador extraor∣dinary
to the court of France, upon a negoti∣ation
<PB N="640" REF="673"/>
of the highest importance. He made
his public entry in January 1718, and per∣formed
the business of his embassy with great
dexterity and honour. In the year 1733, he
resigned all his offices, and retired from pu∣blic
business for some years.</P>
<P>Iu 1741, he was made a field marishal of
the forces, and sent ambassador to the states
general. He had the government of Minor∣ca,
and was commander in chief of the allied
army, <HI>anno</HI> 1743, till his majesty took the
command at the battle of Dettingen.</P>
<P>In 1745, he had a third time the com∣mand
of the royal Scotch dragoons.</P>
<P>He married lady Eleanor Campbell, daugh∣ter
of James second earl of Loudoun, dow∣ager
of James viscount Primrose; but died
without issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1747.</P>
<P>Sometime before his death, he assigned his
estate and honours (which he thought he had
a right to do by the patent) to John, son of
his youngest brother George the baron, in
prejudice of the sons of colonel William, the
eldest brother; but the same being contested
in the house of lords, the honours were ad∣judged
to James, son of the said colonel Wil∣liam,
to whom we now return.</P>

Stair, and immediate younger brother of John
the second earl, married Penelope countess of

accomplishments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, Chart. Willi∣elmo domino Alexander e∣quiti. domi∣nii et baroniae Novae Scotiae in America, &amp;c.</NOTE> and became a great favou∣rite

<P>After the death of king James VI. his son
king Charles resolved, that no encouragement
should be wanting to the settlement of a colo∣ny
that appeared to be of so great advantage to
the nation: he therefore appointed sir Willi∣am
lieutenant of Nova Scotia, and instituted
the order of knight baronet for the advance∣ment
of it, of which order sir William was
the first, and obtained the privilege of coin∣ing
small copper money, which was a step
greately inveighed against at that time: how∣ever
the king being fully convinced of his abi∣lities
and integrity, appointed him one of his
privy council, and secretary of state, in the
year 1626, which high offices he enjoyed with
honour and reputation as long as he lived.</P>

<P>The earl being one of the council of Ply∣mouth
for the affairs of New-England, in con∣sideration
of his interest therein, the said coun∣cil,
by a deed bearing date the 22d day of A∣pril
1635, granted to him all that part of
New-England between the rivers of Kene∣beek
and St. Croix; also all those islands of
Stirling, or Long-Island, which now make a
considerable part of the province of New-York;
and he was at a very great expence in
settling colonies therein, particularly in Long-Island,
where he introduced the first British
inhabitants; which settlement gave rise to the
now flourishing colony of New-York.</P>

by his eldest son,</P>
<P>IV. Sir ANDREW MURRAY of Arngosk
and Balvaird, who was one of the gentlemen
of the bedchamber to king James VI. with
whom he was in great favour.</P>
<P>He got charters under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> of the
lands and baronies of Arngosk, Kippo, Park,
and a great many others, betwixt the years
1572 and 1588, and took a new investiture
of his estate, by way of entail, to himself in
liferent, and Andrew Murray his son and ap∣parent
heir, and the heirs-male of his body, in
fee; which failing, to David Murray his bro∣ther-german,
and the heirs-male of his body;
which failing, to Mr. Robert, then to sir Pa∣trick,
and their heirs-male; which failing, to
David Murray of Airdith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> his uncle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
This is confirmed by a charter under the great
seal, <HI>anno</HI> 1588.</P>
<P>It may here be observed, that William Mur∣ray
of Letter-Bannachie, uncle to this sir An∣drew,
and elder brother to David of Airdith,
is omitted in this substitution, for what reason
we know not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> but he was afterwards repon∣ed
and put in his due place.</P>
<P>Sir Andrew married Margaret, daughter of
John Crichton of Strathurd, descended of
George earl of Caithness, lord high admiral
of Scotland in the reign of king James II.
and by her he had issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Andrew,</HI>—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Anne,</HI> married to sir Mungo Murray of
Drumcairn, a younger son of John earl of
Tullibardine, of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>He died before 1604, and was succeeded
by his only son,</P>
<P>V. Sir ANDREW MURRAY of Balvaird,
who was the first of this family that relin∣quished
the title of Arngosk.</P>
<P>He made a new entail of his estates of Bal∣vaird,
Arngosk, Pitlochie, Conland, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to
himself and the heirs-male of his own body;

<P>The charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in which he is designed <HI>An∣dreas

dated 8th May 1604.</P>
<P>He married Margaret, daughter of sir
William Menteith of Carse; but dying with∣out
issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1624, his estate devolved up∣on
his uncle and heir-male,</P>
<P>IV. Sir DAVID MURRAY of Gospitrie,
<PB N="646" REF="679"/>
second son of sir Andrew Murray of Arngosk
and Balvaird, who, from his youth, was bred
at the court of king James VI. and being a
man of extraordinary parts, great honour, and
integrity, was highly esteemed by his maje∣sty,
who first made him his cup-bearer; then
master of the horse, and captain of the guard;
and having conferred on him the honour of
knighthood, made him comptroller of the
royal revenue, upon the removal of sir David
Home of Wedderburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. et chart. penes vice∣com. de Stor∣mont.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1599; in which
offices he served his majesty with great fide∣lity
and loyalty.</P>
<P>He attended the court from Falkland to
Perth, on the memorable 5th of August 1600,
when the earl of Gowrie and his brother
made that audacious attempt upon his maje∣sty's
sacred person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">History of Gowry's con∣spiracy.</NOTE> where he was greatly in∣strumental
in saving the king's life.</P>
<P>He did another remarkable piece of service
to the court at this juncture; for after the
earl of Gowrie, then provost of Perth, was
killed, the whole town was in an uproar, and
heavily threatened the authors of his death;
but sir David, by his great prudence and re∣solute
conduct, with the assistance of his young
cousin William second earl of Tullibardine,
quelled the tumult,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and conducted the king
and court safe back to Falkland.</P>
<P>For which good services, he was ever after
amongst the first favourites of the king, who
thought he could never bestow too much
upon so good and faithful a subject and servant.</P>
<P>He first gave him the barony of Ruthven,
the chief seat of the Gowrie family, which
came to the crown by the earl's forfeiture,
and was afterwards called Huntingtower.
Soon thereafter he bestowed upon him the
lands of the whole abbay of Scoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv. et pe∣nes vicecom. de Stormont.</NOTE> of which
the earl of Gowrie had been commendator,
erected it into a temporal lordship, to be cal∣led
the lordship of Scoon, with a seat and
vote in parliament; and he was therein, with
the greatest solemnity, invested, 7th April
1605, by a special commission, directed to
the earl of Dunfermline, then chancellor for
that effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Workman's M. S. a herald who assisted at the investi∣ture.</NOTE> the earls of Angus, Sutherland,
Marishal, Linlithgow, the lords Fleming,
Drummond and Thirlestane, being witnesses
to the ceremony; which erection was con∣firmed
to the lord Scoon by a special act of
parliament, <HI>anno</HI> 1606; about which time he
had the office of ranger of the Lummonds,
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orestry of the woods, and the old castle-stead
of Falkland conferred upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes vicecom▪ de Stormont.</NOTE> with
several other beneficial grants.</P>
<P>Some time thereafter, he made a settle∣ment
of his estate and honours, which was
ratified and confirmed by a charter from king
James VI. under his own hand, in these terms:</P>
<P>1st, To our well-beloved cousin David lord
Scoon, and the lawful heirs-male of his bo∣dy;
which failing,</P>
<P>2dly, To sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird,
his nephew, and the lawful heirs-male of his

family); which failing,</P>
<P>7thly, To William Murray, son of sir Wil∣liam
Murray of Clermonth, and the heirs-male
of his body, (of whom sir James Murray,
general-receiver of the customs of Scotland is
now the representative.) <HI>Quibus omnibus defi∣cientibus,</HI></P>

14th October 1616.</P>
<P>The lord Scoon being a man of great un∣derstanding
and steady resolution, was appoint∣ed
his majesty's high commissioner to several
general assemblies of the church, where he
conducted himself with such prudence, and
intrepidity, that he had a great hand in car∣rying
through some things that met with
much opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotiswood's and Calder wood's eccle∣siast. histories.</NOTE> in reference to the bringing
the church of Scotland to some nearer degrees
of uniformity with that of England, which
the king had very much at heart.</P>
<P>And as he behaved with no less zeal for
his majesty's service, when the five articles of
Perth assembly were ratified in the parliament
1621, he was immediately dispatched by the
marquis of Hamilton, the king's high com∣missioner,
to communicate his success to the
court, when his majesty was graciously plea∣sed,
in recompence of his great and many ser∣vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vicecom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Stormont.</NOTE>

<P>III. General WILLIAM DRUMMOND of
Cromlix, son of John second lord Maderty, was
a man of good parts, great honour, and most
sincerely attached to the interest of the roy∣al
family.</P>
<P>He betook himself to a military life when a
young man; by his merit he rose to the high∣est
rank in the army, and was inferior to
none of his cotemporaries for his knowledge
in the art of war.</P>
<P>He had a considerable command in the
army that was raised for the king's relief,
when he was prisoner in the Isle of Wight,
<HI>anno</HI> 1648.</P>
<P>He had the command of a regiment at the
battle of Worcester, where he was taken pri∣soner;
but afterwards made his escape, retir∣ed
to the North, joined the loyalists, and kept
close with them till they were dispersed by
general Morgan, <HI>anno</HI> 1654.</P>
<P>When he found he was able to do no more
for the king at home, he went abroad into
the service of the czar of Muscovy, where he
had the highest commands; and by his bra∣very
and conduct acquired to himself great
reputation and honour.</P>
<P>After the restoration, king Charles II. cal∣led
him home, and made him major-general
of all the forces in Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1666; in
which character he served the crown with
great fidelity for many years, and was made
general of the ordnance in 1684.</P>
<P>Upon king James VII.'s accession to the
crown, he was made general of all the forces
in the kingdom, and one of the lords of the
treasury.</P>

<HEAD>Earl of STRATHERN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS dignity, by some authors, is said
to have been first conferred upon</P>
<P>WALENUS, a man of rank in England,
who having contracted a friendship with king
Malcolm Canmore, when in that kingdom,
accompanied him to Scotland, and assisted
him in recovering his crown; wherefore that
generous prince nobly rewarded him, promot∣ed
him to great honours, gave him consider∣able
possessions in lands in Perthshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ja. Bal∣four, Martin, &amp;c.</NOTE> and cre∣ated

signalized himself in the service of
his king and country at the battle of Standard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abb. Revel's hist. p. 342.</NOTE>

in Perth, in the beginning of the reign of king
Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. I. p. 450.</NOTE> who succeeded to the crown of

<P>When a peace was concluded between king
Alexander II. of Scotland, and king Henry III.

one of the council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 559 and 566.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1255.</P>
<P>He married a daughter of Eugene de Erga∣dia,

<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VI. MALISE, sixth earl of Strathern, also
a man of singular merit, and a true lover of
his country. He was one of the Scotch nobles
who agreed to the marriage of princess Mar∣garet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. II. p. 1083.</NOTE>
daughter of king Alexander III. with
Eric king of Norway, <HI>anno</HI> 1281.</P>
<P>He was also one of those worthy patriots
who entered into a solemn engagement to
maintain and defend princess Margaret's right
to the crown of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 266.</NOTE> in case of king A∣lexander's
death without male-issue, <HI>anno</HI> 1284.</P>
<P>This earl, with several others of the nobi∣lity,
joined in a letter to king Edward I. of
England, concerning a marriage between Mar∣garet
of Norway, undoubted heir to the crown
of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> and prince Edward of England,

determination in favours of John Bali∣ol,
and was obliged to acknowledge him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 644.</NOTE> <HI>an∣no</HI>
1294; but he died soon thereafter.</P>
<P>He married Mary, daughter of sir John Cum∣min
of Badenoch, who, in Mr. Rymer's col∣lections,
is designed spouse of Malise earl of
Strathern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 727.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1296.</P>
<P>By her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>Malise,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Mary,</HI> married to sir John Murray of Drum∣sargard,
knight, of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his only son,</P>
<P>VII. MALISE, seventh earl of Strathern,
a worthy patriot, a steady loyalist, and always
unvariably attached to the interest of his king
and country.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch nobles who sign∣ed
that famous letter to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> asserting
the independency of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>During the minority of king David Bruce,
he opposed Edward Baliol with all his inte∣rest;
wherefore, when that prince prevailed,
he was by him forfeited, and his earldom of
Strathern given to an English lord, John de
Warren earl of Surrey, cousin to king Ed∣ward
III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. IV. p. 595.</NOTE> in compensation <HI>sumptum et labo∣rum

&amp;c.</HI> 2d March 1334.</P>
<P>Earl Malise used all his interest to recover
his estate, by the influence of his friends with
Edward Baliol, and lest he should have suc∣ceeded,
king Edward III. of England wrote
two letters to Baliol in favours of his cousin
the earl of Surrey, dated also in March 1334.
Immediately thereafter, we find this John de
Warren designed <HI>comes Surriae et de Strathern,</HI>
in that scandalous deed, whereby Edward Ba∣liol
renounces and surrenders to king Edward
of England, these counties of Scotland, with
their castles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 614.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> Berwick, Roxburgh, Jed∣worth,
Selkirk, Etrick, Edinburgh, Hadding∣ton,
Linlithgow, Peebles, and Dumfries, 12th
June 1334.</P>
<P>This worthy earl (according to Mr. Craw∣furd)
married, 1st, a daughter of the earl of
Orkney, but she having been concerned in
some treasonable practices against the king,
was, with some others, condemned to perpe∣tual
imprisonment, where she died, according
to these remarkable words of a good author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 274.</NOTE>

<P>He married, 2dly, Marjory, daughter of

Robert de Muscamp, which is instructed by a

said, <HI>Malisius comes de Strathern, uxorem ha∣buit

&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But it seems he had no surviving issue by
either; for the earldom of Strathern, of which
earl Malise had been forfeited by Baliol, was
again resumed by king David, carl Malise hav∣ing
died without children; and that earldom
was, by the said king David, conferred upon his
friend and favourite sir Maurice Moray, the
heir of line of the family, being son of his
sister Mary, before mentioned, to whom we
now return.</P>
<P>VII. MARY, only daughter of Malise sixth
earl of Strathern, and sister of the seventh
earl, married to sir John Moray of Drumsar∣gard,
as before observed, who got with her
from her father the lands of Abercairny, O∣gilvie,
Glensherop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes Abercairny.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were afterwards
confirmed to him by Malise earl of Strath∣ern,
her brother. The charter is still ex∣tant.</P>
<P>We shall here only observe, that, accord∣ing
to Mr. Crawfurd, this sir John was son
of sir Andrew Moray lord of Bothwell, <HI>et
panetarius Scotiae,</HI> whose succession is deduced
under the title Moray lord of Bothwell, page
80th, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of this work, to which we refer
our readers.</P>
<P>By the said Mary he had issue three sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Maurice,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> who succeeded his bro∣ther,
and carried on the line of the family of
Abercairny.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Walter,</HI> ancestor of the Morays of O∣gilface,
in Linlithgowshire.</P>
<P>VIII. Sir MAURICE MORAY, eldest son
of the above Mary, by the said sir John, was
a steady loyalist, and firm friend of king Da∣vid
Bruce, with whom he was in great fa∣vour.</P>
<P>The earldom of Strathern being now in the
crown, by the expulsion of the English pos∣sessors,

<HEAD>LYON Earl of STRATHMORE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS illustrious family is of French ex∣traction,
and descended from the anti∣ent
house of de Leonne in that kingdom, who
derived their origin from the noble race of
the Leones of Rome.</P>
<P>As there were several great and flourishing
families of the de Leonnes in France in the
tenth century, one of the first rank amongst
them came to England with William the Con∣queror,
<HI>anno</HI> 1066, and had a considerable
command in his army. His son, sir Roger
de Leonne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Carse's history of the family, M. S. penes comi∣tem de Strath∣more.</NOTE> came to Scotland with king Ed∣gar,
son to king Malcolm Canmore, about the
year 1098; and for the good and faithful
services performed by him against Donald
Bain the usurper, he obtained from king Ed∣gar
certain lands in Perth-shire, which, after
him, were called Glen-Lyon; and this sir
Roger de Leonne is witness in a charter of
that prince to the monastery of Dunfermline,
which the author of the manuscript says he
has seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dated <HI>anno regni</HI> 7<HI>mo,</HI> which is <HI>anno
dom.</HI> 1105.</P>
<P>Of this sir Roger was lineally descended,</P>
<P>I. Sir JOHN LYON, a man of great worth
and merit, who flourished in the reigns of
king Robert Bruce, and his son king David,
from which last prince he obtained a charter,
<HI>dilecto et fideli suo Johanni Lyon, militi, prop∣ter
fidelem et fortem operam sibi et patri suo
praestitam, &amp;c.</HI> of the lands and baronies of
Forteviot and Forgundenny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Strathmore.</NOTE> in Perth-shire;
the lands of Curtestoun and Drumgovan, in
Aberdeen-shire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This charter has no
date; but, by the witnesses, appears to have
been granted about the year 1342 or
1343.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John,</HI> afterwards lord Glammis.</P>
<P>2.—<HI>Lyon,</HI> who had two sons, Pa∣trick
and Michael,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> both mentioned in a char∣ter

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>II. Sir JOHN LYON, first designed of For∣teviot,
who obtained from king David Bruce,
<HI>pro fideli servitio suo impenso et impendendo,</HI>
an annuity of ten merks sterling yearly, dur∣ing
all the days of his life, to be uplifted out
of the proceeds of the justice eyres benorth
the river Forth. This is instructed by a char∣ter
proceeding upon a precept, directed to
the king's chamberlain for the time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> dated
10th April 1368.</P>
<P>He acquired from John de Barclay, lord
of Tullibothwel, the lands of Tullinact, in the
forest of Boyn, in Banf-shire, with the lands
of Ballandirest, in the barony of Culace, in
the shire of Forfar. This appears by two
charters still extant;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> the one without a date;
the other dated 28th May 1369.</P>
<P>He also acquired from Walter Lesly, after∣wards
earl of Ross, all his lands in the terri∣tory
of Forgundenny,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> by a charter, dated <HI>anno</HI>
1370.</P>
<P>This sir John was a man of great parts and
fine accomplishments, and became a mighty
favourite of king Robert II. from whom he
got a charter under the great seal, <HI>pro lauda∣bili

<HEAD>SUTHERLAND Earl of SUTHERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great and illustrious family yields
to none in the kingdom for antiquity.
Our historians mention thanes and earls of
Sutherland, as soon as those dignities were
known in Scotland.</P>
<P>They are said to be sprung from a warlike
people called the Moravii, who came from
Germany to this country, in the reign of king
Corbred I. to whom they gave great assistance
in his wars against the Romans.</P>
<P>King Corbred rewarded them nobly, gave
them large possessions in the Northern parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's col∣lect. Gordon's history of Su∣therl. Camb∣den, Collier's dict. Scotch compend. &amp;c.</NOTE>
where they settled; from them the county
of Murray had, its name; and their posterity
became proprietors of all that large tract of
country now called Murray, Ross, Sutherland,
Caithness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a very good history of this noble
family written by sir Robert Gordon of Gor∣donstoun,
a man of great ingenuity, learning
and knowledge; but he deduces their descent
no farther back than,</P>
<P>ALAN, thane of Sutherland, a man of great
power and authority, who flourished in the
reigns of king Duncan and MacBeth the u∣surper.
When the Northern parts had been
invaded by a considerable body of Danes and
Norvegians, under the conduct of their king
Olaus, and had possessed themselves of a great
part of Rossshire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this Alan raised his vas∣sals
and followers, attacked them, gave them
a total overthrow on a muir called Drumlea,
near Creigh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gordon's hi∣story of Su∣therland, pe∣nes comit. de Sutherland.</NOTE> in Sutherland, and drove them
entirely out of the country, <HI>anno</HI> 1031, and
the vestiges of that conflict are still to be seen
on the said muir of Drumlea, where a helmet
and coat of mail were lately dug up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After MacBeth had murdered king Dun∣can,
he greatly dreaded the power of the
thane of Sutherland. He knew he was a great
patriot, and had been very active in keeping
up the spirits of the loyalists in favours of
prince Malcolm, the rightful heir of the
crown: he therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound means to get
him put to death also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> a little before the re∣storation
of king Malcolm.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>WALTER, thane of Sutherland, who, in
reward of his father's faithful services,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gord. Home, Buchanan, Crawf. &amp;c.</NOTE> and
great sufferings, and his own merit, was cre∣ated
earl of Sutherland by king Malcolm III.
in the very beginning of his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1057,
and was one of the first in the kingdom who
enjoyed that dignity.</P>
<P>He died in 1097, leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>ROBERT, second earl of Sutherland, who
succeeded him, and flourished in the reign of
king Alexander I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE></P>
<P>He built the castle of Dunrobin, which
hath ever since been one of the chief seats of
the family.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>HUGH FRISKIN, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> Thus our
authors have accounted for the first earls of
Sutherland.</P>
<P>This Hugh was indeed the real and un∣doubted
progenitor of this noble family, but
was not the son of Robert, which will appear
from unquestionable authority.</P>
<P>He was the son of Friskin or Friskinus, who
was proprietor of all those Northern countries.</P>
<P>Whether this Friskin was brother or cou∣sin
to Robert second earl of Sutherland, we
cannot pretend to determine, but from him
we proceed to deduce the descent of this most
ancient family, by indisputable documents.</P>
<P>I. FRISKINUS, who, it is said, had that
name put upon him by his being a great war∣rior;
Friskin, in the old language, signifying
the man with the ready hanger, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He was one of the greatest men in the
kingdom, had vast possessions in lands in the
counties of Murray, Ross, Sutherland, and
Caithness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he divided amongst his
children, whose posterity assumed their sir∣names
from their possessions, as was the cu∣stom
of those early times.</P>
<P>To his son <HI>William</HI> he gave a great estate
in Murray; the lands of Duffus, Rossile, Inchi∣kil,
Machir, Kintrai, and many others, all
mentioned in a charter of confirmation of
king William, in which are these remarkable
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> com. de bu∣chan, et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tul. of Mur∣ray.</NOTE> <HI>Quas terras Friskinus, pater ejus, te∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it

<HI>Vide</HI> titles Murray duke of Athole, Mur∣ray
lord Bothwell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pages 51st and 80th.</P>
<P>Friskin had another son,</P>
<P>II. HUGH, who in many authentick writs,
is designed son of Friskin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalrymple's collections.</NOTE> and brother of
William, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In a confirmation charter by king William,
of a donation of the church of Kingussen, by
Bricius bishop of Murray, <HI>Willielmus filius
Friskini,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Murray, page 156.</NOTE> <HI>et Hugo Friskin frater ejus,</HI> are wit∣nesses.
This charter has no date, but as Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins
was made bishop in 1203, and king Wil∣liam
died <HI>anno</HI> 1214, it must have been with∣in
that space.</P>
<P>In another charter of the same prince, of
<PB N="661" REF="694"/>
the church of Aberkerdor, upon the determi∣nation

<P>Though many more documents might be

the descendents of William son of Fris∣kin,
and the Sutherlands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet's ap∣pend. p. 191.</NOTE> the descendents of
his brother Hugh, had the same armorial bear∣ing,
<HI>viz.</HI> three stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Hugh got from his father Friskin, se∣veral
lands in Sutherland, which are still in
the family's possession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrymple.</NOTE> and from which his po∣sterity
assumed their sirname. He, according
to sir Robert Gordon, Mr. Crawfurd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
was third earl of Sutherland, but was only the
first of this line.</P>
<P>He was also a gallant officer, and defeated
a considerable body of the Danes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gordon and Crawfurd.</NOTE> and slew
their general at Embo in Sutherland, in the
end of the reign of king William the Lyon.</P>
<P>He made a donation to Gilbert archdeacon
of Murray (afterwards St. Gilbert) of the
lands of Skelbo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comit. de Su∣therland.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Sutherland, confirm∣ed
by a charter under the great seal from king
William, which is still extant.</P>
<P>He died in the beginning of the reign of
king Alexander II. who succeeded king Wil∣liam,
<HI>anno</HI> 1214, and left issue a son,</P>
<P>III. WILLIAM, second earl of Sutherland,
who succeeded him.</P>
<P>He confirmed his father's donation of the
lands of Skelbo to St. Gilbert, and built the ca∣thedral
church of Dornock in Sutherland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family of Su∣therland.</NOTE> and
called it St. Gilbert's church: the south-isle
whereof hath been the burial place of the fa∣mily
ever since.</P>
<P>This noble earl had also several encounters
with the Danes and Norvegians, who often
invaded that part of the country. He gain∣ed
one remarkable victory over them in the
reign of king Alexander II. in memory
whereof, there was a cross erected, called
Ree-cross to this day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gordon's hi∣story of Su∣therland.</NOTE> Ree-cross in Galic,
signifies the king's cross, to denote that the
Danish king or general was buried there.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1248, and was succeeded by
his infant son,</P>
<P>IV. WILLIAM, third earl of Sutherland,
who was a man of great parts, a true patriot,
and no less a brave soldier than an able states∣man.</P>
<P>There was a controversy, which had long
subsisted betwixt the bishops of Caithness and
earls of Sutherland, about the lands of Skelbo,
Pronsie, Thirbolt, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was at last ami∣cably
compromised between Archibald bishop
of Caithness and this earl. The indenture or
agreement, which is still preserved, bears, <HI>con∣troversia,

The agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indent. penes comit. de Su∣therland.</NOTE> to which the bishop's and the
earls seals are appended, is dated the 10th of
the calends of October 1275.</P>
<P>This earl was one of the Scotch nobles
who entered into a solemn agreement or as∣sociation,
to receive and defend princess Mar∣garet
of Norway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 266.</NOTE> for their lawful queen and
sovereign, in case of king Alexander III.'s death
without issue-male, <HI>anno</HI> 1284.</P>
<P>He, with several others of the nobility,
joined in a letter to king Edward I. of Eng∣land,
concerning a marriage between queen
Margaret of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 471.</NOTE> and his eldest son Ed∣ward
prince of Wales, <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>He was also one of the arbiters chosen on
the part of Robert Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> in his competition
for the crown with John Baliol.</P>
<P>And though he, with many others of his
countrymen, was forced to swear allegiance
to king Edward I. of England, when he had
over-run Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lections, vol. III. p. 653.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1296; yet he join∣ed
king Robert Bruce as soon as he began to
assert his title to the crown, continued steady
in his interest as long as he lived, and per∣formed
many brave actions in defence of the
liberties of his country, under the conduct of
that great prince; particularly at the battle of
Bannockburn, where he was one of the chief
commanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd, Gordon, &amp;c.</NOTE> and had no small share of the
glory acquired by the Scots on that memo∣rable
24th June 1314.</P>
<P>He was also one of the first of the Scotch
nobility who signed that famous letter to the
pope, asserting the independency of Scotland,
<HI>anno</HI> 1320,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> to which his seal is appended.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1325, in the 77th year of

a man of singular worth and merit, a firm and

his son king David, and one of the ablest ge∣nerals

lost his life fighting valiantly in defence
of the liberties of his country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 311.</NOTE> on 22d July

a great statesman, and a gallant soldier;
and in king David's minority, did signal ser¦vices
to his country, by often invading Eng∣land,
and distressing the enemy.</P>
<P>He accompanied king David Bruce in his

<HEAD>SANDILANDS Lord TORPHICHEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Sandilands is by some
authors said to be of English extraction:
that a considerable family of that name, in
the county of Northumberland, being driven
from their possessions by William the Con∣queror,
took refuge in Scotland, and were
<PB N="669" REF="702"/>
kindly received by king Malcolm Canmore,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Others are of opinion that it is a local sir∣name,
and was first assumed by the proprietors
of the lands and barony of Sandilands, in the
county of Lanark, as soon as sirnames became
hereditary in Scotland.</P>
<P>The immediate ancestor of this noble fa∣mily
was,</P>
<P>I. Sir JAMES SANDILANDS, who flou∣rished
in the reign of king David Bruce, and
obtained from that prince a grant of the lands
of Craiglokard and Stanipath; also <HI>annuos red∣ditus

which William Douglas lord of Liddisdale, sir
Andrew, and sir John Douglas, knights, with
many others, are witnesses.</P>
<P>He married Eleanora, daughter of Archi∣bald
the tenth lord, and sister of William the
first earl of Douglas, relict of Alexander earl
of Carrick, nephew of king Robert Bruce.</P>
<P>He obtained a grant from the said William

<HI>anno</HI> 1350. In consequence of which mar∣riage,
this family hath ever since continued to
quarter the arms of Douglas with their own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I: p. 94.</NOTE></P>
<P>By the said Eleanora, he had issue a son,</P>
<P>Sir <HI>James,</HI> his heir,—and a daughter,</P>

Sandilands and of Calder; which last conti∣nued
long to be the chief title of his family.</P>
<P>He made a great figure in the reign of king
Robert II. and was a mighty favourite of that
prince, who bestowed upon him in marriage
his daughter lady Jean Stewart, relict of sir
John Lyon lord of Glammis.</P>
<P>He obtained from the said king Robert, upon

<P>By the said Mariotte, a daughter of Archi∣bald
Forrester of Corstorphin, he had issue
two sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>John,</HI> who carried on the line of this
family, of whom more hereafter.</P>

<P>2. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to William Wachop

<P>He died about the year 1530.</P>
<P>As sir James was the first of this family
who was raised to the dignity of the peerage,
we proceed to give an account of him before
his elder brother.</P>
<P>Sir JAMES SANDILANDS, second son of
sir James of Calder, a man of great parts
and learning, who having, in the course of
his travels, resided some time in the island of
Malta, he there gave such proofs of his great
capacity and universal knowledge, that upon
the death of sir Walter Lindsay, lord of St.
John, he was preferred by the knights of
Malta to the preceptory of Torphichen, the
chief residence of the knights of the order of
St. John of Jerusalem and the temple of So∣lomon,
in Scotland. He was received by the
grand prior of the hospital, with all the necessa∣ry
forms, and was constituted chief or head
of that order, with the jurisdiction of lord St.
John of Jerusalem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage, and father Hay's vindication of Eliz. More.</NOTE> in Scotland, and got pos∣session
of the whole revenues of the precep∣tory
of Torphichen, which then were very
considerable, <HI>anno</HI> 1543.</P>
<P>He was also a man of great honour and in∣tegrity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
as well as of prudence and sagacity,
and was often employed in negotiations of im∣portance,
both by king James V. and queen
Mary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and always acquitted himself with dex∣terity
and reputation.</P>
<P>When the reformation was established in
1560, the lord St. John embraced the prote∣stant
religion. He resigned in the queen's
hands the whole preceptory of Torphichen,
and got that military benefice erected into a
temporal lordship, containing the baronies of
Torphichen, Liston, Balintrode, Tankerton,
Denny, Marycoulter, Stenhope, Galtna, <HI>&amp;c.
&amp;c.</HI> lying within the shires of Edinburgh,
Peebles, Linlithgow, Stirling, Lanark, Kin∣cardin,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be called the barony and
lordship of Torphichen, with all the dignities
and privileges of a lord of parliament, to him
and his heirs and assignees whatever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by a
charter under the great seal, dated 24th Ja∣nuary
1563; for which he instantly paid
down ten thousand crowns of the sun, and he
and his successors became bound to pay a seu∣duty
of five hundred merks <HI>per annum.</HI></P>
<P>We must here observe, that both the bro∣thers,
sir John and sir James, were great pro∣moters
of the reformation; and it is report∣ed,
that the first protestant sacrament that was
administred in Scotland, was by John Knox,
in the great hall of Calder-house, sir James
being then lord Torphichen.</P>
<P>He married Janet, daughter of—
Murray of Polmais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> but dying without is∣sue,
his estate and honours devolved upon
James Sandilands of Calder, his grand ne∣phew,
and heir-male, and of line, being line∣ally
descended of his brother John before
mentioned, to whom we now return.</P>

<P>THE immediate ancestor of this great

was,</P>
<P>Sir JAMES STEWART, called the black

queen Jean, daughter of John duke of

son of king Edward III. of England,
and widow of king James I. of Scotland.</P>
<P>By her he had two sons.</P>

ended in John the fifth earl, only son of his

<PB N="673" REF="706"/>
of Auchterhouse, by whom he had a
son, Alexander, who succeeded him in the
earldom of Buchan, and whose male line end∣ed
in his great grandson.</P>
<P>This earl, by Margaret his second wife, a
daughter of Patrick Murray of Philiphaugh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart's hi∣story, and Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE>
an antient family in the county of Selkirk,
had another son,</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> the first of this family.—He had
also three daughters; for which <HI>vide</HI> title
Stewart earl of Buchan, page 94th.</P>
<P>I. JAMES STUART, second son of James
earl of Buchan, obtained from his father, in
patrimony, the lands and barony of Traquair
in the county of Peebles, which is instructed
by a charter from the said earl, <Q REND="inline">"to and in
favours of James Stuart his son, of the
lands and barony of Traquair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes comitem de Traquair.</NOTE> to him and

Traquair confirmed to him, by a charter un∣der
the great seal from king James IV. dated
23d January 1492;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> which barony hath ever
since continued to be one of the chief titles
of the family.</P>
<P>This James also obtained from his brother,
Alexander earl of Buchan, a grant of the
lands of Melross in Banss-shire, to be holden
of the said earl, <HI>Jacobo Stuart fratri suo caris∣simo;</HI>
also a precept for infefting him there∣in;

<P>He married Christian, sister and co-heiress
of Richard Rutherfoord of that ilk, and
daughter of Philip Rutherfoord by Eliza∣beth
his wife, daughter of sir Walter Kerr of
Cessford, ancestor of the duke of Roxburgh;
for which marriage, they being within the
degrees of consanguinity forbidden by the
church, they obtained a dispensation from the
pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original bull ibid.</NOTE> dated 9th November 1505.</P>
<P>He got with her the lands of Rutherfoord
and Wells, in Roxburgh-shire; and in con∣sequence
of this marriage, the family have e∣ver
since continued to quarter the arms of
Rutherfoord with their own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nisbet, vol. I. p. 180.</NOTE></P>
<P>By her he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> who succeeded him.</P>
<P>This James being a man of great spirit and
fortitude, accompanied king James IV. to
the fatal field of Flowdon, where he lost his
life with his royal master, <HI>anno</HI> 1513.</P>
<P>II. WILLIAM, second baron of Traquair,
upon his father's resignation, got a charter un∣der
the great seal from king James IV. <HI>Wil∣lichno
Stuart, filio et haeredi apparenti Jacobi de

<P>He got afterwards a charter from king
James V. <Q REND="inline">"to and in favours of William Stu∣art
of Traquair, and Christian Hay his
spouse in liferent, and Robert Stuart their
eldest son and apparent heir in fee, of the

<P>In the reign of king James V. John earl of
Buchan, who was cousin-german to this Wil∣liam

earldom of Buchan, <Q REND="inline">"to and in favours of

the laird of Traquair; which failing, to
the heirs-male of the earl of Athole;
which all failing, to his own nearest heirs

<P>This is instructed by a confirmation and
signature, (wherein the above entail is fully
narrated,) signed by king James VI. by Mon∣trose
his chancellor, and sir Robert Melvile
his secretary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original sig∣nature penes comitem de Traquair.</NOTE> ordering a charter under the
great seal to pass upon the same. The sig∣nature
is dated the penult day of April 1585.</P>
<P>We must here observe, that though the
male issue of the laird of Traquair and the
earl of Athole are, in the above substitution,
preferred by the earl of Buchan to his own
daughters; yet it never took effect; and in
the end the heir of line succeeded to that
earldom, but the laird of Traquair is justly
preferred to the earl of Athole, he being one
degree nearer in propinquity to the said earl.</P>
<P>This William, by the said Christian Hay,
a daughter of John second lord Yester, ance∣stor
of the marquis of Tweeddale, had issue
four sons.</P>

<P>He was a man of great integrity and merit,
and a steady friend of queen Mary. He had
the honour of knighthood conferred upon
him at the creation of the duke of Albany,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stewart and Crawfurd.</NOTE>
and was captain of her majesty's guards.</P>
<P>He was one of those who, with the queen

<P>He died without issue about the year 1580,

of the castle of Dunbarton, <HI>anno</HI> 1582,
and got a charter under the great seal, <HI>Wil∣lielmo

Craig-Douglas, Black-house, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> dated 26th
March 1495.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE></P>
<P>He was also a man of worth and honour,
and was one of the gentlemen of the bedcham∣ber
to king James VI. but dying unmarried,
<HI>anno</HI> 1604, his whole estates devolved upon
his brother,</P>

<P><HI>Isabel,</HI> daughter of James of Traquair, was
married to William Rutherfoord of Quarrie∣holes,

<P>This James died in the beginning of the

<P>IV. JOHN STUART of Caverston, eldest

<P>This John was a man of extraordinary na∣tural
parts, which were greatly improved by
a liberal education, of remarkable steadiness
and integrity, of great learning, a consummate
statesman, and invariably attached to the in∣terest
of the royal family, on which account
he afterwards suffered great and many hard∣ships.</P>
<P>When a young man, he was elected knight
of the shire of Tweeddale to the parliament

talents, and had the honour of knight∣hood
conferred upon him by king James VI.

dated 29th January 1622.</P>
<P>Upon the accession of king Charles I. to
the crown, who soon discovered his great ca∣pacity,
he became a mighty favourite of that
prince; who, first, appointed him treasurer-depute,
then raised him to the dignity of the
peerage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diploma in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by the title of lord Stuart of Tra∣quair,

26th July 1634.</P>
<P>In the year 1635, he was made lord high
treasurer of Scotland; and his majesty,
having had many proofs of his loyalty and fi∣delity,
<PB N="675" REF="708"/>
appointed him his high commissioner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Records of parliament of the church.</NOTE>
both to the parliament and general assembly
<HI>anno</HI> 1639.</P>
<P>In that high station he asserted the king's
prerogative with such firmness and intrepidi∣ty,
that he gained himself many enemies, even
amongst the more moderate sort; so that his
majesty was most unwillingly forced to lay
him aside, though he knew him to have been
a most faithful minister.</P>
<P>He was afterwards impeached for treason
by the parliament 1641, of which they found
him guilty; but submitted his punishment to
the king, who knew his only crime had been
his steady attachment to his interest; he there∣fore
ordered him a pardon under the great
seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> wherein is fully narrated an ample testi∣mony
of his great abilities, and singular inte∣grity
in the discharge of his duty.</P>
<P>Though the brevity of this work will not
permit us to give a minute detail of all the
transactions and vicissitudes of fortune that at∣tended
this noble lord, yet we cannot but ob∣serve,
that though he has been most unjustly
aspersed by the sactious party which then
prevailed, yet his royal master was always
convinced of his fidelity, and the uprightness
of his heart, which many original letters from
his majesty, all written with his own hand,
and still preserved in the family, which we
have seen, do sufficiently testify; we there∣fore
take the liberty to insert some few of
them here; the first was written immediately
after the parliament had passed sentence a∣gainst
him.</P>

After the parliament passed sentence upon
him in 1641, his estate was sequestrated, and
he was banished his native country. He went
directly to the king, was most graciously re∣ceived;
and the above letters show, that he
was constantly trusted and employed by his
majesty ever after.</P>
<P>He was with the king at Oxford in 1644,
when the Scotch army was to march into Eng∣land,
which they bound themselves to do by
the solemn league and covenant.</P>
<P>He was one of the few Scotch peers who
signed a remonstrance against that conjuncti∣on
of their countrymen with the parliament
at Westminster.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rushworth's collect. and Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE></P>
<P>He afterwards came to Scotland, but lived
retired till 1647.</P>
<P>He was then permitted to come to parlia∣ment,
where he used all his interest to get an
army raised for the king's relief, then a pri∣soner
in the isle of Wight. He levied a regi∣ment
of horse upon his own charges, and,
with his son the lord Linton, marched into
England, and fought on their head at the
battle of Preston, <HI>anno</HI> 1648, where they
were both taken prisoners. The lord Lin∣ton
obtained his liberty some time thereafter,
but the old earl was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, minutes of parliam. and rescind. acts.</NOTE> by order of the English
parliament, confined in the castle of Warwick
for four years, and the sequestration of his e∣state
still continued.</P>
<P>At last Oliver Cromwell, believing he
could do him no more harm, being denuded
and deprived of all his possessions, permitted
him to return to Scotland, where he led a
private life till he died.</P>
<P>This noble earl married lady Catharine
Carnegie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contr. penes comitem de Traquair.</NOTE> daughter of David first earl of
Southesk, by whom he had a son,</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> lord Linton,—and four daughters.</P>

<P>All these three had issue.</P>
<P>4. Lady <HI>Catharine,</HI> married to John Stew∣art,
Esq; without issue.</P>
<P>We shall sum up this great man's character
in the words of a noble historian, who is not
suspected of partiality towards the Scots.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"He was without doubt not inferior to a∣ny
of the Scotch nation, in wisdom and
dexterity, and though he was often pro∣voked
by the insolence of some of the bi∣shops
to a dislike of their over-much ser∣vor,

to the king was without blemish, and his
affection to the church so notorious, that
he never deserted it, till both it and he
were overthrown and trode under foot,

<P>AS the origin and descent of the great and

<HEAD>HAY Marquis of TWEEDDALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE antiquity of the noble and illustri∣ous
name of Hay, is sufficiently attested
both by antient and modern historians; and
though we shall not pretend to disprove the
traditional account of their origin from the
battle of Loncarty about the year 980, which
is so fully narrated in many Scotch histories,
and particularly under the title of Errol, page
247th of this work, yet we beg leave to of∣fer
to the reader's consideration some conjec∣tures,
which are supported by many presump∣tive
proofs, and concurring circumstances,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That the sirname of Hay came originally
from France: that there were lands and a
lordship or that deno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ation in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yormandy,
from which its pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able the sirname was
first assumed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histoire som∣maire de Nor mandie par le sireur de Mas∣savile, penes MacFarlane.</NOTE> long before the time or Willi∣am
the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. This is attested by un∣doubted
authority.</P>
<P>Humphry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Vetulis, lord of
Pont-Aude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd one of
the most considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in that country,
married Albreda de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by
whom he had a son, Roger de Bellamont, or
Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mont, lord o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pont-Andemar, who gave
the name of Beaumont-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oger to a town in
Normandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Dugdale's ba∣ronage of England.</NOTE> and was one of the council who
persuaded William duke of Normandy to in∣vade
England, before the year 1066.</P>
<P>In the list of the great captains that came
over from Normandy to England with that
heroic prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. of Nor∣mandy, vol. I. p. 201. and roll of Battle Abbay, &amp;c.</NOTE> le sieur de la Haya is express∣ly
mentioned, with several others of the same
name; which plainly shows, that they were a
numerous and flourishing family before the
conquest.</P>
<P>That there were several religious houses
founded by them, appears from the same hi∣story:
particularly le Abbay de Blancheland,
in the diocese of Contasines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histoire de Normandie.</NOTE> was founded and
endowed by Richard de la Haya in Norman∣dy,
<HI>anno</HI> 1155.</P>
<P>That the Hays in Normandy had the same
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morial bearings with these in Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Books of arms of old French families, pen. MacFarlane.</NOTE></P>
<P>And that for some generations after they
were settled in Scotland, many of them were
designed by the appellation of de la Haya: all
which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> strong presumptive proofs, that
they came originally from France;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. Rymer's foed. Angliae.</NOTE> and it is
certain, that there are families of that sirname
subsisting in Normandy to this day, who de∣duce
their pedigree above a hundred years
before the conquest.</P>
<P><PB N="678" REF="711"/>
As then there is clear proof, that several
of that name came to Britain in the year
1066; and as it appears, from our records,
that they were settled and making a figure
in Scotland within less than an hundred years
thereafter, it is extremely probable, that
some of that race came to Scotland with our
king David I. as it appears from all our histo∣ries,
that several of Norman extraction, who
had contracted a friendship with that amiable
prince, when in England, came along with
him, and settled in this country, of whom
some of the most considerable families in Scot∣land
are descended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduction to Fordun's hist. p. 60.</NOTE> such as Bruces, Maules,
Somervilles, Colviles, Normanviles, Montgo∣meries,
Baliols, and many others.</P>
<P>'Tis hoped, therefore, that it reflects no
dishonour on this illustrious family, to appear
to have sprung from a noble family in France,
who certainly settled in this island within less
than an hundred years after the battle of Lon∣carty,
and were a great and flourishing fami∣ly
in Normandy before it.</P>
<P>And as he first of the family of Errol we
find upon record,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Scoon, Mur∣ray, Cupar, St. Andrews, &amp;c.</NOTE> was William de la Haya,
who was settled in Perthshire in the reigns of
king David I. and king Malcolm IV. so there is
sufficient proof, that William de la Haya,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle, Kelso, Dun∣fermline, &amp;c.</NOTE> an∣cestor
of the family of Tweeddale, was set∣tled
in Lothian much about the same aera.</P>
<P>And as it does not appear from any
record, that they were of the same fami∣ly,
it is highly probable, that the latter was a
son or grandson of one of those great captains,
of the name of Hay, who came over to Eng∣land
with William the Conqueror; and at∣tending
king David into Scotland, settled in
the South parts, as the ancestor of the family
of Errol settled in the North of that kingdom.</P>
<P>We now proceed to our documents.</P>
<P>I. WILLIELMUS de la HAYA, the un∣doubted
ancestor of this noble family, flou∣rished

about the year 1290.</P>
<P>He was a lover of peace, and a true friend
to his country. He used his utmost endea∣vours
to get the differences between Bruce
and Baliol, about the succession to the crown,
settled and adjusted in an amicable manner,
without the aid of foreigners; but died about
1292 or 1293, without having the pleasure

under him performed many brave actions in
the service of his country.</P>
<P>He entered into a memorable association
with sir Alexander Seton and sir Neil Camp∣bell,
wherein they bound themselves to de∣fend
the liberties of their country, and king
Robert Bruce's title to the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The original is amongst the archives of the family of Marr.</NOTE> against all

When king James took the admini∣stration

A singular event happened in this lord's fa∣mily,
<HI>viz.</HI> His page, Hepburn, accused his ma∣ster
of horse of a design to poison him; the

<P>He was a man of great parts and judgment,
and opposed the introduction of the liturgy
with all his interest, in the parliaments 1633
and 1637; yet was a great loyalist, and had
the command of a regiment in the king's
army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotch comp. p. 141.</NOTE></P>
<P>He, with his son the master of Yester, and
several of the nobility, waited on the king at
Newcastle. His majesty was so well satisfied
with his fidelity and good behaviour, that he
raised him to the dignity of earl of Tweeddale,
1st December 1646.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in can∣cellaria.</NOTE></P>
<P>He married, 1st, lady Jean Seaton, daugh∣ter

<P>XIX. JOHN, second earl of Tweeddale,
who was a nobleman of great accomplishments,
and always steady in the interest of king
Charles I.</P>
<P>When the king set up his standard at
Nottingham in 1642, he joined him, and
continued in his army for some time.</P>
<P>In 1648, when several of the loyal nobili∣ty
went into a resolution of raising an army
to rescue the king, the lord Yester joined
them, and had the command of the East Lo∣thian
regiment, consisting of twelve hundred
men. He marched with them into England,
was at the battle of Preston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 236.</NOTE> where their ar∣my
was defeated, and the duke of Hamilton,
their general, taken prisoner.</P>
<P>After the murder of the king, he continu∣ed
with the loyal party, and assisted at the co∣ronation
of king Charles II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> at Scoon, <HI>anno</HI>
1651.</P>
<P>When the king marched into England, he
garrisoned his castle of Niedpath for his ma∣jesty's
service, which held out against Oliver
Cromwell longer than any place besouth the
Forth.</P>
<P>Immediately after the restoration, he got
charters under the great seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> of all his lands;
and king Charles II. as a reward of his loyal∣ty
and fidelity, appointed him one of the
lords of his privy council, a commissioner of
the treasury, and one of the extraordinary
lords of session. In all which offices he con∣tinued
till 1674, when he resigned them, on
account of some differences between him and
the duke of Lauderdale, whose daughter his
son had married; but in 1682, he was again
restored to his employments in the council
and exchequer; in both which offices he con∣tinued
till the end of the reign of king James
VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state, p. 238.</NOTE> who appointed him one of his privy coun∣cil
in March 1685.</P>
<P>In the year 1686, finding himself greatly
oppressed with debts, chiefly occasioned by
cautionry for the earl of Dunfermline, and
others, he sold his whole estate in Tweeddale,
to William duke of Queensberry, which he
gave to his second son the earl of March.</P>
<P>The earl of Tweeddale came early into the
revolution, and king William and queen Mary
knowing his great abilities and skill in the
management of public business, appointed him
one of the lords of the privy council in May
1689,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commissions in pub. arch.</NOTE> and one of the commissioners of the
treasury in September thereafter.</P>
<P>In January 1692, he was made lord high

<HEAD>WEMYSS Earl of WEMYSS.</HEAD>
<P>AS the descent of the noble and illustri∣ous
family of Wemyss, from the anci∣ent
earls of Fife, is instructed by charters in
our public records, and other authentic do∣cuments,
still preserved in the family, and
mentioned by several historians, to these we
refer our readers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Rob Sib∣bald's hist of Fife, sir James Dalrymple's hist. collect appendix to Nisbet, 2dvol. Malcolm's history of the family, who had perused all their writs, &amp;c.</NOTE> and shall here only give a
brief account of the origin of their sirname,
which, like many others in this country, is
certainly local, and was first assumed by the
proprietors of the lands (of old) called
Wemyss-shire, which contained all that tract
of ground lying betwixt the lower part of
the water of Ore and the sea.</P>
<P>These lands got their name from the great
number of caves that are on them, all along
the sea coast. A cave in the old Galic or
Celtic language was called Vumhs; from that
these lands got the name of Vams-shire. In
process of time they came to be called
Wemyss-shire; which name they still retain,
as will appear from several charters under the
great seal, hereafter narrated; and from hence
the sirname of the family.</P>
<P>The lands of Wemyss-shire, the parishes
of Kennoway, Markinch, Lochoreshire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which lye contiguous to one another, were
the undoubted property of the ancient earls
of Fife; a great part whereof were given by
Gillimichael the fourth earl, and Duncan, his
eldest son, to his second son Hugo, the proge∣nitor
of this noble family. And as the ma∣ny
ample privileges conferred upon the great
MacDuss by king Malcolm Canmore, and en∣joyed
by his posterity, are fully narrated by
our historians, and briefly under the title earl
of Fife, page 27 4th of this work, we pro∣ceed
to deduce the descent of the family of
Wemyss from their immediate ancestor.</P>
<P>IV. GILLIMICHAEL, fourth earl of Fife,
great grandson of MacDuff the first earl, was
witness to the foundation charter of the ab∣bay
of Holyroodhouse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St Andrews, and Dun∣fermline.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1128, and is
mentioned in several other charters of king
David I.</P>
<P>He died <HI>anno</HI> 1139, leaving issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Duncan,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugo,</HI> of whom the family of Wemyss is
lineally descended.</P>
<P>Duncan, fifth earl of Fife, succeeded his fa∣ther
Gillimichael,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St. Andrews, penes Mac∣Farlane, page 301.</NOTE> and made a donation, <HI>Deo et
ecclesiae Sti. Andreae, &amp;c. ecclesiam de Markinch,
cum omnibus pertinen. &amp;c. pro salute animae suae,
et Helae comitissae sponsae suae, &amp;c.</HI> before the
year 1154; in which year earl Duncan died.
His male line ended in Duncan the thirteenth
earl, who died <HI>anno</HI> 1353, leaving issue only
one daughter, who died without children.</P>
<P>V. HUGO, second son of Gillimichael, the
fourth earl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. &amp; Char∣tul. of Dun∣fermline.</NOTE> got from his father the lands of
Wemyss-shire, some lands in Lochore-shire,
and in the parish of Kennoway, all holding of
himself and his successors, earls of Fife.</P>
<P>He obtained also from his brother Duncan,
the fifth earl, some lands in the parish of
Markinch, with the superiority of the pa∣tronage
of the church thereof, which is in∣structed
by a donation hereafter mentioned.</P>
<P>There is, in the chartulary of Dunferm∣line,
in the reign of king Malcolm IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 187.</NOTE> a pre∣cept
directed to Duncan earl of Fife, and Hugo
son of Gillimichael, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> before the year 1165;
in which year king Malcolm died.</P>
<P>Hugo died in the year 1167 or 1168, and
was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VI. HUGO or EGO, who, being proprie∣tor
of the lands of Markinch, confirmed his
uncle's donation, in these words: <HI>Omnibus,
&amp;c. Hugo, filius Hugonis filii Gillimichael,
<PB N="685" REF="718"/>

chancellor, who died in 1171, and Richard
bishop of St. Andrews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of St. Andrews, p. 302.</NOTE> who died <HI>anno</HI> 1173,
are witnesses.</P>
<P>This Hugo lived after the year 1200, and
left issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. Sir JOHN, who succeeded him in all
his lands. He appears to have been a man
of distinguished rank and figure, and in his
younger days took the app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llation of John of
Methkil, from a sea-port town of that name,
which is situate near the east end of Wemyss-shire.</P>
<P>This is instructed by a convention betwixt
the prior and convent of St. Andrews, and
the archdean thereof, wherein <HI>Johannes de
Methkill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 382.</NOTE> <HI>Andreas de Moravia, Robertus de
Haya, Galfridus vicecomes de Fife,</HI> are wit∣nesses,
<HI>anno</HI> 1212.</P>
<P>He afterwards made a donation of the pa∣tronage
of the church of Wemyss to the mo∣nastery
of Soltray, in these words: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Domi∣nus
Johannes de Methkill, miles, &amp;c.—

donation has no date, but appears to have
been made in the end of the reign of king
William, who died <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>As sirnames began about this time to be
frequently used in Scotland, sir John, in the
beginning of the reign of king Alexander II.
from his lands of Wemyss-shire, assumed that
of Wemyss for his sirname, which his whole
posterity hath enjoyed ever since.</P>
<P>He had issue three sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Michael de Wemyss,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de Wemyss,</HI> who is mentioned in

his father's donation to the monastery
of Soltray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> of the patronage of the church of

<P>He died before the year 1260, leaving issue

<HI>dominus de Wemyss.</HI> He renewed the
donations of his predecessors to the monaste∣ry

<P>This sir John was a man of parts and ho∣nour,
a brave soldier, and in great favour
with king Alexander III. He is particular∣ly
mentioned by a good author, who designs
him <HI>Johannes de Wemyss, miles strennus, &amp;c.</HI>

Cunningham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 97.</NOTE> where king Alexander III. ob∣tained

<P>After the death of king Alexander III.
king Edward I. of England was extremely
desirous to have princess Margaret, daughter

the crown of Scotland) married to his eldest
son prince Edward. In 1290, the estate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
the kingdom sent two noble knights, sir Mi∣chael

<P>A monument of this honourable embassy

<P>He was one of the commissioners chosen

for the crown with Robert Bruce, <HI>anno</HI>

<P>In the same year the commissioners met at
Berwick upon Tweed, and sir Michael took
the oath to king Edward, as sole arbiter in
the case,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 594.</NOTE> and it is well known how king Ed∣ward
determined that important affair in fa∣vours
of Baliol.</P>
<P>There is still extant an indenture betwixt
<HI>dominus Michael de Wemyss,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">In archivis familiae de Wemyss.</NOTE> <HI>dominus de eodem,

1329.</P>
<P>It may here be observed, that by the pre∣ceeding
account it is fully proven by authen∣tick
documents, before 1330, that the family
of Wemyss had in their possession all the
lands premised to have been given by Gilli∣michael
fourth earl of Fife, and his eldest son
Duncan, to Hugo his second son, their un∣doubted
ancestor, <HI>viz.</HI> the lands of Wemyss-shire,
some lands in Lochore-shire, lands in

all which they continued to hold of the earls
of Fife, their superiors, till Isabel countess of
Fife, only daughter and heiress of Duncan the

resigned all her lands and superiorities in fa∣vours
of Robert duke of Albany, which were
afterwards annexed to the crown by the for∣feiture
of duke Murdoch, (<HI>Vide</HI> title earl of

<P>ALL our historians and antiquaries agree,

in Scotland, and was called Le Flammang,
from the country from whence he came;

Luss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> to Malcolm son of John de Luss, <HI>Mal∣colmus

has no date, but appears to have been granted
before the year 1280. Whether this sir Hugh
was brother of sir Malcolm, we cannot pre∣tend
to determine; but the Flemings were
become numerous in Scotland before the reign
of king Robert Bruce, there being no less
than eight of that sirname to be found swear∣ing
allegiance to king Edward I. of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prynne's col∣lect. vol. III. p. 651, 654, &amp;c.</NOTE>

<P><PB N="694" REF="727"/>
Sir Malcolm was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>V. Sir ROBERT FLEMING, a great hero
and patriot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. II. p. 471.</NOTE> He was one of the Scotch nobles
who wrote to king Edward I. of England, con∣cerning
the marriage of queen Margaret with
his son prince Edward, <HI>anno</HI> 1290.</P>
<P>And though he, with many of his coun∣trymen,
had been compelled to swear allegi∣ance
to king Edward I. of England, yet as
he believed a forced oath was not binding,
he was amongst the first men of rank in the
kingdom that joined king Robert Bruce, in
defence of the liberties of his country, was
with him at Dumfries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, and all Scotch historians.</NOTE> when the Cummin
was dispatched for betraying him, and was
very instrumental in getting the crown set
upon that great man's head, <HI>anno</HI> 1306.</P>
<P>Sir Robert being deservedly in great favour,
and highly esteemed by king Robert Bruce,
obtained from him, for his many faithful ser∣vices,
grants of several lands, particularly the
lordship of Lenzie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam. of Wig∣ton.</NOTE> and barony of Cumber∣nauld,
then in the crown, by the forfeiture
of the Cummins.</P>
<P>He left issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Malcolm,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. Sir <HI>Patrick Fleming</HI> of Biggar, who car∣ried
on the line of this family, of whom after∣wards.</P>
<P>This great man died before the year 1314,
and was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. Sir MALCOLM FLEMING, designed
of Fulwood and Cumbernauld, a man of sin∣gular
honour and integrity, who, on account
of his own merit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta in ro∣tul. Rob. I. baroniam de Kirkintul∣loch, cum per∣tinen. quae fuit quondam Jo∣hanni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cum∣min, militis, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the great services of
his worthy father, obtained from his majesty
a new grant of the whole lands and barony
of Kirkintulloch, in Dunbartonshire, which
formerly belonged to sir John Cummin,
knight, by his royal charter, dated <HI>anno</HI>
1314.</P>
<P>He got another charter under the great
seal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ro∣tul. Rob. I.</NOTE> of the lands and barony of Auchindoun,
in the same county, upon the resignation of
sir Malcolm Drummond of that ilk, <HI>anno</HI>
1316.</P>
<P>He obtained also from Walter lord high
steward of Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the fam▪ of Wig∣ton.</NOTE> an annuity out of the
barony of Kers, by a charter dated on the
feast of St. Dunstan, <HI>anno</HI> 1321.</P>
<P>He was likeways, by his majesty, appoint∣ed
high sheriff of the county,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and chartulary of Lennox.</NOTE> and governor
of the castle of Dunbarton; which offices he
executed with great fidelity.</P>
<P>He died in the end of the reign of king
Robert Bruce, and left issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. Sir MALCOLM FLEMING of Cum∣bernauld,
who succeeded him, and inherited
all the virtues of his worthy ancestors, was a
firm and steady friend of the royal family;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE>
and in the beginning of the reign of king
David Bruce, was constituted governor of
Dunbarton castle; in which office he did his
country signal service.</P>
<P>This sir Malcolm's capacity and integrity
being well known to the whole nation, he
was intrusted with the tuition of the young
king.</P>
<P>After the unfortunate battles of Duplin
and Halidonhill, when the Baliol's party be∣gun
to prevail and increase, the governor and
estates of the nation thought it adviseable to
send his majesty and his royal consort to France,
for the more security of their persons, and
the faithful sir Malcolm was pitched upon to
be their conductor; which important charge
he executed with dexterity and success.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abercrombie, and all Scotch historians.</NOTE> They
arrived safe in France, and met with a most
noble and kind reception from king Philip.</P>
<P>Sir Malcolm immediately returned to his
government and command of the castle of
Dunbarton, which he nobly defended, ahd
kept out against the whole Baliol party, when
almost every other fort in the kingdom had fur∣rendered
to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 311.</NOTE> so that it became the only
asylum and safe retreat for the loyalists during
the absence of king David.</P>
<P>The guardians of Scotland, having at last re∣covered
a great part of the nation to the king's
obedience, longed much to have his majesty
again amongst them. The brave sir Mal∣colm
Fleming was thought the fittest man in
the kingdom to be employed in that great
trust. He went to France accordingly. He
again performed his office with prudence and
fidelity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> and had the good fortune to conduct
his majesty safe back to Scotland in July
1342.</P>
<P>King David was no sooner in possession of
his kingdom, than he begun to reward his
faithful servants. He created sir Malcolm
Fleming earl of Wigton, and bestowed upon
him all the lands belonging to that earldom,
to him and the heirs male of his body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in the archives of the family of Wigton, hae∣red. de corp. suo perlineam mascul. de∣scendentibus.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
by his royal charter, dated at Air, 9th No∣vember
1342; and as this charter, which
contains many clauses very honourable for the
family, is fully narrated in Crawfurd's peer∣age,
page 493, to that we refer our readers.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1346, he made
a donation to the monastery of Newbottle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Newbottle, p. 169.</NOTE>
<HI>pro salute animae suae, &amp;c.</HI> to which Duncan
and Walter Flemings were witnesses.</P>
<P>This noble earl accompanied king David
in his unfortunate expedition into England,
was taken prisoner with him at the battle of
Durham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. V. p. 537.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1346; was for some time con∣fined
<PB N="695" REF="728"/>
in the tower of London, but was re∣leased
soon afterwards, and was very instru∣mental
in forming embassies for procuring his
royal master's liberty, which at last was hap∣pily
accomplished in the year 1357; the earl
himself being then one of the Scotch com∣missioners
who managed that important ne∣gotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. VI. p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>The earl had a son,</P>
<P>VIII.—, his apparent heir, whose
Christian name is not come to our knowlege,
but he died before the year 1351, leaving
issue a son,</P>
<P>Thomas.</P>
<P>The old earl died about the year 1362,
and was succeeded in his estate and honours
by his grandson,</P>
<P>IX. THOMAS, second earl of Wigton. He
was one of the noble Scotch heirs proposed to
be sureties for king David's liberty, in the
year 1351, and is then designed <HI>nepos et hae∣res
comitis de Wigton;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. V. p. 724.</NOTE> but that negotiation
took no effect.</P>
<P>He was afterwards sent to England one of
the hostages for his majesty's ransom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. tom. VI. p. 109.</NOTE> and is
still designed grandson and apparent heir of
Malcolm earl of Wigton, <HI>anno</HI> 1358.</P>
<P>After the death of his grandfather, he got
a charter, under the great seal from king Da∣vid
II. <HI>totius comitatus de Wigton, cum perti∣nen.</HI>
to be holden, and possessed as fully and
freely by this Thomas earl of Wigton, as the
same was granted to, and enjoyed by the
deceased Malcolm earl of Wigton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in ar∣chivis regis Davidis.</NOTE> his grand∣father,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The charter is dated 26th Ja∣nuary,
the 37th year of his reign, <HI>anno</HI> 1366.</P>
<P>This earl having no lawful children, and
being very sensible that in consequence of the
king's royal grant of the earldom of Wigton,
failing lawful male issue of his body, that
earldom must return to the crown: he there∣fore,
and on account of the seuds subsisting
betwixt him and the great men of that earl∣dom
(as the deed bears) fells and dispones to
Archibald Douglas, lord of Galloway, for the
sum of five hundred pounds sterling, the
whole foresaid earldom, with its pertinents,
by his charter thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In archiv. fa∣miliae de Wig∣ton.</NOTE> dated 16th February
1371, which was afterwards ratified and con∣firmed
to the earls of Douglas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> by many char∣ters
under the great seal.</P>
<P>Immediately thereafter, the earl resigned
his baronies of Lenzie, Cumbernauld, and se∣veral
others of his lands, in favours of his
cousin and heir-male, sir Malcolm Fleming of
Biggar, which were also ratified and confirm∣ed
by charters under the great seal, as will be
shown hereafter.</P>
<P>This earl dying without lawful issue, in
him ended the male line of sir Malcolm of
Cumbernauld, eldest son of the said sir Ro∣bert
Fleming. The representation, therefore,
of this noble family devolved upon sir Mal∣colm
Fleming of Biggar, son of sir Patrick,
before mentioned, to whom we now return.</P>
<P>VI. Sir PATRICK FLEMING, second son
of sir Robert, and brother german of the first
sir Malcolm of Cumbernauld, was likeways
a faithful and steady friend of king Robert
Bruce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charta penes marchionem de Tweeddale</NOTE> who appointed him high sheriff of the
county of Peebles.</P>
<P>He married one of the daughters and co∣heiresses
of the brave sir Simon Fraser of Oli∣ver-castle,
by whom he got the lands and ba∣rony
of Biggar, which became one of the
chief titles of the family; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SirGeo. Mac∣Kenzie, Nis∣bet, Craw∣furd, &amp;c.</NOTE> in conse∣quence
of this marriage, they have ever since
continued to quarter the arms of Fraser with
their own.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his son,</P>
<P>VII. Sir MALCOLM FLEMING of Big∣gar,
who obtained from Malcolm earl of Wig∣ton,

<P>He was also a man of great worth and me∣rit,
and was by king David II. appointed she∣riff
of the county of Dunbarton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Levenax.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI>
1364.</P>
<P>Upon the resignation of his cousin Thomas
earl of Wigton, he got the lands and barony
of Lenzie, and others, as before observed,
which were confirmed to him by a charter
under the great seal from king Robert II.

payable by the religious at Holyrood-house,
by his royal charter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chart. in pub. archiv.</NOTE> <HI>Davidi Fleming domino

<P>Sir David, with a considerable body of his
friends and followers, accompanied prince
James (afterwards king James I.) when he
went to take shipping at the Bass, intending to
go to France. He saw him safe on board,
and, in his return home, was, at the instiga∣tion
of sir Alexander Seton, attacked at Long∣hermiston-muir
by sir James Douglas, with
a body of men; where, after a smart conflict,
sir David was slain on 24th February 1405.

<P>During the duke of Albany's regency,
Scotland being threatened with an invasion

France to desire succours from that crown. The
affair took up longer time than was expected,
and the estates of the nation in 1519 sent
the lord chamberlain to hasten his return
home: he was very assisting to him in his
negotiation, and managed his business with
such prudence and dexterity, that the duke

<P>The lord chamberlain was at first on the
king of England's side, in relation to the
match between the young queen Mary and
prince Edward of England; but the refor∣mation
being begun in that kingdom, and he
being a staunch Roman Catholic, determined
to oppose every appearance of innovation or
change in the established religion of the king∣dom:
he therefore left the English party,
and went over to the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> believing it
more for the interest of his country.</P>
<P>In the year 1545, he founded and largely
endowed a collegiate church at Biggar, for a
provost, eight prebends, sour singing boys
and six poor men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foundation amongst the writs of the family.</NOTE> reserving the presentation
and patronage thereof to himself and his suc∣cessors
for ever.</P>
<P>Soon after this a war broke out between
Scotland and England. The earl of Hart∣ford,
protector of that kingdom, invaded this
country with a powerful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet and army. The
governor of Scotland raised what forces he
could to oppose him. They came to an en∣gagement
at Pinkie-field, near Musselburgh.
The English obtained the victory, and the
lord chamberlain, with a great many of the
flower of the nobility of Scotland, were kil∣led
on the spot,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ves of the offic. of state.</NOTE> on the 10th day of Septem∣ber

of Leithington, secretary of state in the reign
of queen Mary.</P>
<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XIV. JAMES, sourth lord Fleming, also a
man of great worth and merit.</P>
<P>He was, by the favour of queen Mary,
with consent of the duke of Chattelherault,
the governor, constituted great chamberlain of
Scotland for life, by a patent under the great
seal, 10th March 1553, in which are ful∣ly
set forth the great and faithful services done
to the crown by his father and noble ance∣stors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patent in the writs of the family.</NOTE>
with many other clauses very honour∣able
for the family.</P>
<P>As his capacity and integrity were well
known to the whole nation, he was nam∣ed
one of the commissioners by parliament,
to go to France, and assist in compleating
the queen's marriage with the dauphine, <HI>anno</HI>
1557, where he strenuously stood up for the
rights and liberties of his country; but he
died at Paris in the year 1558,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> not without

<P>By lady Barbara Hamilton, his wise, daugh∣ter
of James duke of Chattelherault, he had
only one daughter,</P>
<P><HI>Jean,</HI> married, 1st, to John lord Thirle∣stane;
2dly, to Gilbert earl of Cassilis.</P>

<P>He was a man of great integrity, honour,

in the service of the royal family,
was pleased to appoint him lord high cham∣berlain
of Scotland for life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Writs of the family.</NOTE> by patent dated

entered into a solemn bond of association, to
stand by and defend queen Mary with their

at Hamilton the 8th day of May 1568.</P>
<P>He held out the castle of Dunbarton long

was at last surprised and taken by captain
Crawford of Jordanhill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lives of the offic. of state.</NOTE> and the governor,
with great difficulty, escaped in a small boat,
<HI>anno</HI> 1571.</P>
<P>He married Elizabeth, only daughter and
heiress of Robert master of Ross, son and ap∣parent
heir of Ninian second lord Ross, by
whom he had one son,</P>

<P>This worthy lord was accidentally wound∣ed
in the knee by a musket ball,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> on the street

<P>THIS noble family yields to none in the
kingdom for antiquity, and their sirname
is said to have been assumed by the proprie∣tors
of the lands and barony of Seaton, in
East Lothian, in the reign of king Malcolm
Canmore. Certain it is, they had vast pos∣sessions
in lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's baronage of England.</NOTE> both in Scotland and Eng∣land,
in very early times; but they were de∣prived
of their English territories by king Ed∣ward I.
as will be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>Their sirname of old was variously syllabi∣cated,
<HI>viz.</HI> Seatoun, Seaton, Setton, and Se∣tun,
but are all the same name.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin's gen. collect. vol. II. p. 226, Sir Ri∣chard Mait∣land's hist. of the fam. Nis∣bet, vol. I. p. 236, Scotch compend. &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>Some of our antiquaries deduce their de∣scent
from,</P>
<P>DOUGAL de SEATON, who flourished in
the reigns of king Edgar and king Alexander
I. both sons of king Malcolm Canmore; which
king Alexander succeeded to the crown of
Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1107, and died in 1124.</P>
<P>That he was father of.</P>
<P>SECHER de SEATON, who is said by the

lands, both in East and West Lothian;
that he was progenitor of all the Seatons in
Scotland, and died in the reign of king David
I. leaving issue a son,</P>
<P>Alexander de Seaton, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As this Alexander is the first we have found
mentioned in any authentic document, from
him we proceed to deduce the descent of this
noble family.</P>
<P>I. ALEXANDER de SEATON lived in the
reign of king David I. who succeeded to the
crown of Scotland <HI>anno</HI> 1124,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir James Dalrymple's collect. page 426.</NOTE> and died in

by that prince to Walter de Riddel, of seve∣ral
lands in Roxburgh-shire, which are now
called the barony of Riddel.</P>
<P>This Alexander was proprietor of the lands
of Seaton and Winton, in East Lothian, and
Winchburgh, in Linlithgow-shire, which is in∣structed
by a charter hereafter narrated.</P>
<P>He died in the end of the reign of king
Malcolm IV. who succeeded king David, and
left issue a son and successor,</P>

<P>He was succeeded by his eldest son,</P>
<P>VI. Sir CHRISTOPHER SEATON, lord
of that ilk, a worthy patriot, and one of the
greatest heroes of his time. He joined the
brave sir William Wallace, in defence of the
liberties of his country, and was a firm and
steady friend of king Robert Bruce, whose
sister, lady Christian, he had the honour to
marry.</P>
<P>At the unhappy battle of Methven, when
king Robert was actually in the English hands,
and in the greatest distress, sir Christopher
was one of the brave Scotch worthies who
rescued his majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Scotch Authors.</NOTE> and got him set at liber∣ty
at that time; from whence he retired to
the Highlands.</P>
<P>Soon thereafter, sir Christopher had the
misfortune to be taken prisoner himself in the
castle of Lochdown, and was, with his brother
John, and several other brave loyalists, most
cruelly put to death by king Edward, in diffe∣rent
places in Scotland and England. Both
Scotch and English historians agree in this,
but we shall here narrate the words of an En∣glish
author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. West∣minster, apud Prynne, page <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>126.</NOTE> who says, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Post hoc captum est

<P>King Robert afterwards, in memory of this
brave sir Christopher, erected a chapel near
Dumfries, where he was put to death; the
ruins whereof are still to be seen, and it re∣tains
the name of Christel's chapel to this
day.</P>
<P>By the said lady Christian Bruce, daughter
of Robert earl of Carrick, and sister of king
Robert, he left issue a son,</P>
<P>VII. Sir ALEXANDER SEATON, lord of
that ilk, who succeeded him, a man of singu∣lar
worth and merit; and, according to doc∣tor
Abercrombie, one of king Robert's fastest
friends. That great prince soon put him in
possession of all the estates his father enjoyed
in Scotland, of which he had been most un∣justly
forfeited by king Edward I. for his
loyalty to his lawful prince. That monarch
also deprived him of his estates in England,
which were very considerable, and bestowed
them upon his English nobles, who had been
most active in the Scotch wars.</P>
<P>His lands in Yorkshire, called Whitby∣strand,
he gave to sir Edmund Manly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dugdale's ba∣ronage, tom. 11.</NOTE> who
had performed many brave actions against the
Scots; and his lands in Northumberland he
gave to the noble family of Dalavale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem and Nisbet.</NOTE> which
retains the name of Seaton-Dalavale to this
day; but it was never afterwards in the
power of this family to recover these lands
out of the hands of the English: However,
king Robert, in reward of his own merit, and
the sufferings of his predecessors, granted him
several noble privileges, made him his own
secretary, and governor of Berwick, erected
his lands of Seaton into a free barony, with
the privileges of a free warreny, discharging
all persons to hunt, hawk, or fish within his
bounds, without the consent of sir Alexander,
or his successors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter in the archives of the family.</NOTE> by his royal charter, dated
the 16th year of his reign.</P>
<P>He was one of the Scotch patriots who
signed that famous letter to the pope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 275.</NOTE> assert∣ing
the independency of Scotland, <HI>anno</HI> 1320.</P>
<P>He got a charter under the great seal, <HI>A∣lexandro

Longniddry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which formerly be∣longed

Barns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem, and Mill's genea∣log. collect.</NOTE> in East Lothian, with many others, by
his charter, dated at Berwick upon Tweed,

<P>He got likeways, on account of his mater∣nal
descent, his armorial bearing of three cres∣scents,
surrounded with a double tressure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir George MacKenzie; and Mr. Nis∣bet.</NOTE>
flowered and counterflowered with flowers de
lis▪ which, with the coat of augmentation
given to his father, being <HI>gules,</HI> a sword, sup∣porting
an imperial crown, hath remained in

<P>He married lady Isabel, daughter of Dun∣can,
tenth earl of Fife, by whom he had two
sons.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>Alexander,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2.—, who was killed with his father
near Kinghorn in Fife,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 304.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1332.</P>
<P>After the death of king Robert Bruce, his
son king David being but a child, the Baliols
thought this a fit opportunity to renew their
pretensions to the crown of Scotland: Edward
Baliol therefore, with the assistance of the king
of England, invaded Scotland with a fleet and
army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, vol. II. p. 304. Cui Alex. deSeton et filius, cum paucis in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acie resistens, ibid. occubuit.</NOTE> and landed in Fife: though the Scots
were no ways prepared for such an unexpect∣ed
attack, yet the brave sir Alexander Seaton
immediately got together what forces he
could to oppose them, but lost his life in the
encounter, near Kinghorn, <HI>anno</HI> 1332.</P>
<P><PB N="704" REF="737"/>
He was succeeded both in his estate and
the government of Berwick, by his son,</P>
<P>VIII. Sir ALEXANDER SEATON, a man
of most remarkable valour and magnanimity,
who gallantly defended the town of Berwick
against king Edward, and the whole English
army.</P>
<P>King Edward having summoned the town
to surrender, threatened, in case of a refusal,
to put to death the governor's two sons, then
in his hands as hostages; but nothing could
prevail with the brave sir Alexander to give
up the town, as long as it was possible to de∣fend
it. King Edward thereupon most bar∣barously
executed those two hopeful young
men, William and Thomas Seatons, even in
their father's view;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fordun, v. II. p. 311, Aber∣crombie, &amp;c.</NOTE> which shocking sight he
bore with a constancy of mind scarce to be
paralleled.</P>
<P>After the unfortunate battle of Halydon∣hill,
when there was no further hope of re∣lief,
sir Alexander was at last obliged to sur∣render
that important place to the then vic∣torious
English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibidem.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1333.</P>
<P>He married Christian, daughter of—
Cheyne of Straloch, a lady endowed with a
most heroic spirit, who was a great comfort
to her husband, in the afflicting scene of their
sons murder, which she also bore with a con∣stancy
of mind beyond her sex.</P>
<P>By her he had issue four sons.</P>

<HEAD>GIFFARD Lord YESTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE sirname of Giffard is of Norman ex∣traction.
According to Mr. Nisbet, and
the manuscript history of the family of Tweed∣dale,
a man of rank of that name came to Eng∣land
with William the Conqueror, where he
settled, and having had a considerable com∣mand
in the army, got a share of the conquer∣ed
lands.</P>
<P>Osbert de Giffard is said to have obtained
from that prince, the lands and barony of Fon∣teil
in Wilt-shire, and was father of another
Osbert de Giffard, lord of Fonteil, who left
issue two sons.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Osbert de Giffard,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hugo,</HI> the first of this family.</P>
<P>I. HUGO de GIFFARD, according to that
learned antiquary sir James Dalrymple, settled
in Scotland in the reign of king Malcolm IV.
who succeeded king David I. <HI>anno</HI> 1153,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface to sir James Dal∣rymple's coll. p. 75.</NOTE> and
died in 1165.</P>
<P>He was father of</P>
<P>II. HUGO de GIFFARD, afterwards lord
of Yester. He appears to have been much a∣bout
the court of king William the Lion, and
was witness to many of that prince's charters,
who succeeded king Malcolm IV. in 1165,
and died <HI>anno</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>In a charter of a donation to the monastery
of Dunfermline, by Walter, son of Alan lord
high steward of Scotland, Hugo de Giffard is
a witness, together with Richard bishop of
St. Andrews, Ingelram bishop of Glasgow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dunfermline, p. 520.</NOTE>
Gregory bishop of Dunkeld, Andrew bishop
of Caithness, and Duncan earl of Fife, in or

died.</P>

When king William obtained his liberty,
after being unfortunately taken prisoner by
the English at Alnwick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 39.</NOTE> <HI>anno</HI> 1174, Hugo de
Giffard was one of the hostages for his ran∣som,
and being in great favour with that
prince, obtained from him a grant of the lands
of Yester in East-Lothian, to which Richard
de Morvile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> constable, and Philip de Valoniis,
chamberlain to king William, were witnesses;
and Yester continued ever after to be the chief
title of this family.</P>

March, of a donation of the patronage of the
church of Innerkeithing, to the monastery of
Dunfermline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Dunfermline, p. 522.</NOTE> Hugo de Giffard is a witness, in

with William bishop of St. Andrews, <HI>an∣te</HI>
1214.</P>
<P>He appears to have been possessed of other
lands besides those of Yester, and made a do∣nation
to the priory of St. Andrews, of the
patronage of his church of Theiling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
confirmed by king William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Book of ori∣ginal writs, i∣bid. p. 326. vol. I.</NOTE> to which Hugh
the chancellor, and earl Duncan justiciar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
were witnesses, <HI>ante annum</HI> 1214.</P>
<P>He left issue a son,</P>
<P>III. WILLIAM de GIFFARD, second ba∣ron
of Yester, who succeeded him, and in his
father's lifetime is mentioned in a charter of
king William, of a donation to the monastery
of Paisley, to which Hugo the chancellor is a
witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chartulary of Paisley. p. 63.</NOTE> in or before 1199, in which year
the chancellor died.</P>
<P>He got a new grant from king William, of
his lands of Yester, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which Florence
elect of Glasgow is a witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawfurd's peerage.</NOTE> who obtained
that office <HI>anno</HI> 1202.</P>
<P>When a peace was concluded between king
Alexander II. of Scotland, and king Henry III.
of England, this William de Giffard, lord of
Yester,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer, tom. I. p. 428.</NOTE> was one of the guarantees of the trea∣ty,
<HI>anno</HI> 1244.</P>
<P>He died soon thereafter, leaving issue a son
and successor,</P>
<P>IV. HUGO de GIFFARD, third lord of
Yester, who was admitted one of the council
to king Alexander III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. p. 559. and 566.</NOTE> upon the change of

the courtesy of Scotland, without any other title;
whereupon sir Thomas Maule of Panmure claimed
this lordship, as nearest heir to Margaret Barelay
countess of Athole, to whose heirs it was provided,
failing heirs of her own body, which is instructed
<PB N="712" REF="745"/>
by a charter in the public register, dated <HI>anno</HI>
1378. Accordingly sir Thomas took instruments
in the tolbooth of Edinburgh, immediately before
the earl's execution, wherein his right by proximi∣ty
of blood to the lordship of Brechin is fully set
forth, the original instrument being still in the earl
of Panmure's custody; and Thomas Bysset of Bal∣wylo
judicially declares, that dame Jean Barclay,
wife to sir David Fleming, was grand-mother to
sir Thomas Maule, who was killed at Harlaw, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which also appears from the writs of the family of
Panmure; notwithstanding all which, the lordship
of Brechin was forfeited, with the earl of Athole's
other estates, and annexed to the crown.</P>

<P>Page 272. of the Peerage, after line 30. <HI>read,</HI></P>
<P>VIII. GEORGE, first lord Forrester, (the eighth
generation of that family) married Christian, daugh∣ter
to Sir William Livingston of Kilsyth, by whom
he had five daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Helen,</HI> married to William lord Ross.</P>

<P>5. <HI>Lilias Forrester,</HI> married to William, second
son of the said lieutenant-general William Baillie,
who carried on the line of this family, as will be
shown hereafter.</P>
<P>On occasion of these two last marriages, this
George, lord Forrester, having no male-issue, he,
and the said lieutenant-general William Baillie,
made a joint settlement of their respective estates
of Corstorphine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Torwood-head, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
favours of the said James Baillie, and the issue-male of
his marriage with the said Jean Forrester; <Q REND="inline">"which

of his marriage with the said Lilias Forre∣ster;
which failing, to their respective heirs
whatsomever, or heirs-general, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In consequence of this settlement, the said George,
lord Forrester, made a resignation of his peerage in∣to
the king's hands; upon which he obtained a new
patent, exactly in terms of the above settlement,
in these words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>in favorem dicti Jacobi

the said James being therein designed master of
Forrester; and he and his successors are obliged to
carry the name and arms of lord Forrester, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
This patent is dated 13th August 1650, and do∣cumented
by a charter in the public register, and
records of parliament.</P>
<P>George lord Forrester dying soon thereafter,
was accordingly succeeded by his son-in-law,</P>
<P>IX. JAMES BAILLIE, who having, in terms
of the patent, assumed the name and arms of this
family, was second lord Forrester.</P>
<P>After the death of the said Jean Forrester his
first wife, he married, 2dly, lady Jean Ruthven,
daughter of Patrick earl of Forth and Brentford;
but dying without issue by either, the estate and
honours, according to the last-mentioned patent,
devolved upon his brother and heir,</P>
<P>IX. WILLIAM, third lord Forrester, who, by
the said Lilias, daughter of the first lord, left issue
a son and successor,</P>
<P>X. WILLIAM, fourth lord Forrester, grandson
of the first lord, who married a daughter of Sir
Andrew Birnie of Saline, one of the senators of the
college of justice, by whom he had four sons and
two daughters.</P>
<P>1. <HI>George,</HI> his heir.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Andrew Forrester,</HI> who was major to the
third troop of horse-guards, but died unmarried.</P>

<P>4. <HI>John,</HI> captain of a ship of war, who married
Elizabeth Tyrrel, sister of sir Charles Tyrrel of the
county of Southampton, by whom he had a son,
William, who succeeded to the honours, as will
be shown hereafter.</P>
<P>1st daughter, <HI>Lilias Forrester,</HI> married to Wil∣liam
Stirling of Herbert-shire, Esq; without issue.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Margaret,</HI> married to Patrick Haldane, Esq;
advocate, to whom she had a son, brigadier gene∣ral
George Haldane, who died governor of Jamaica,
and a daughter, Margaret Haldane.</P>
<P>This lord died <HI>anno</HI> 1705, and was succeeded
by his eldest son,</P>
<P>XI. GEORGE, fifth lord Forrester, who having
gone into the army, served some years in Flanders
under the duke of Marlborough, and rose to the
rank of a lieutenant-colonel.</P>
<P>He signalized himself in the government's service
at Preston in Lancashire, <HI>anno</HI> 1715. He receiv∣ed
a dangerous wound at the attack of that place,
but happily recovered, and was soon thereafter ad∣vanced
to be colonel of one of the troops of horse-grenadier-guards,
and was afterwards made colonel
of the fourth troop of horse-guards.</P>
<P>He married Charlotte, daughter and co-heiress

cousin-german and heir-male, William, son of his
uncle John before-mentioned, to whom we now
return.</P>
<P>XII. WILLIAM, only son of captain John For∣rester,
fourth son of William the fourth lord,
succeeded to the honours as above, and was seventh
lord Forrester.</P>
<P>This William was also a lieutenant in the royal
navy; but dying unmarried in November 1763,
in him ended the whole male line of the saids James
and William, the two brothers named in the sub∣stitution
of the patent 1650, as before observed:
yet the peerage does not appear to be extinct; for
both the patent in 1633, and that in 1650, are
