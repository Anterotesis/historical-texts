<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN Men mistake in one Thing,
'tis very usual to have the World
think they mistake in every Thing;
and 'tis an easy thing to find a
Stone to throw at a Dog.</P>
<P>Had the poor <HI>Weavers,</HI> who I am now to
speak of, brought their Complaints against the
exorbitant Wearing of <HI>Callicoes</HI> in a regular
and justifiable Manner, and before the pro∣per
Judges of those Things; as their Conduct
could not have been reproach'd, so the Grie∣vance,
which now suffers by their mistake,
would, perhaps, have met with more Friends.</P>
<P>But wise and impartial Men will learn to
distinguish between the Justice of a Cause, and
the Mistakes of the Managers of it; between
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
the Reason of the Complaint, and the disor derly
manner of Complaining: And this is all we shall
have occasion to say of the poor mistaken tumul∣tuous
<HI>Weavers,</HI> leaving them to the Clemency
and Compassion of the Government, whom they
have offended, but recommending the Grie∣vance
under which they groan, to the serious
Consideration of those in whose Power it is to
redress it.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Weavers</HI> suffer under the general
Calamity of Trade; that they, and even the
whole Manufacturing part of the Nation, are
oppress'd by the exorbitant growth of clande∣stine
Trade, and the unreasonable pouring in
of <HI>East-India</HI> Wrought Goods upon us. This
will admit of no Debate, at least, none that
can be supported by Reason: What little can be
said for it is so easily confuted and expos'd, and
has so often been fully answer'd, that little
will be wanting now: But according to my Ti∣tle,
to state the Case clearly and impartially be∣tween
Woollen and Silk Goods made at Home,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
and the Callicoes and Wrought Silks printed
here, or clandestinely imported from Abroad.</P>
<P>In order to enter upon this Affair with all
possible Clearness and Plainness, and, if we can,
to strike at the Root of the Mischiefs we com∣plain
of, I shall first lay down some general Pro∣positions
as Fundamentals in this Question of
Trade, obliging my self to give such Evidence
for the proof of them, as shall take away all pos∣sible
Pretences to deny the Fact; and this I do
at first, that we may have no stum bling at the
Threshold, no cavelling at the Terms, or shuf∣fling
off the Question from one thing to ano∣ther;
but that as I may talk to Men of Busi∣ness,
I may talk likewise to their Understand∣ing
and Conviction. My Propositions are,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Woollen and Silk Manufactures
of this Kingdom being the Staple of our
Trade, and the most considerable and assential
part of our Wealth, the Fund for our Expor∣tation,
the Support of our Navigation, and
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
the only Means we have for the Employing
and Sunsisting our Poor; it is therefore the
common Interest of the whole Kingdom to dis∣courage
every other Manufacture, whether
foreign or assum'd, so far as those Manu∣factures
are ruinous to, and inconsistent with
the Prosperity of the said <HI>British</HI> Manufactures
of Wool and Silk.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Wearing and Using Printed or
Painted Callicoes, as they are now almost uni∣versally
worn and used in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is
ruinous to, and inconsistent with the Pro∣sperity
of our <HI>English</HI> Manufactures, as well
those of Wool as those of Silk.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the total prohibiting the Wearing
and using of Printed and Painted Callicoes in
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is not ruinous to, or inconsi∣stent
with the Prosperity of the <HI>East India</HI>
Trade; or, <HI>to put it into an Affirmative that
may be more capable of Evidence,</HI> the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade may and would remain in a very
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
thriving and flourishing Condition, and be
carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the
Adventurers, tho all the Subjects of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and of <HI>Ireland</HI> were effectually limitted
from, and prohibited the wearing and using of
Printed and Painted Callicoes.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Printed and Painted Callicoes
now worn and used in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> come un∣der
four Denominaitons, <HI>ALL pernicious and
destructive</HI> to our Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) such as be∣ing
inported by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are either printed
in the <HI>Indies</HI> or in <HI>Holland,</HI> and clandestinely
run on Shoar here, in spite of former Prohi∣bitions:
<HI>OR</HI> such as being imported here by
our own <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and prohibited
to be worn because printed in <HI>India,</HI> are pre∣tended
to be exported, but are privately run
on Shoar again and sold: <HI>OR</HI> such as being
printed here, are entered and ship'd for Ex∣portatian,
in order to dram back the Duties
on the Stamps but are re landed and sold
here; and lastly, such as are Printed here,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
and legally worn and used, and under the
<HI>Colour of which ALL</HI> the other Frauds are
practis d and conceal'd.</P>
<P N="5">5. That this clandestine Importation and Re∣landing
of Printed and Painted Callicoes, is
no way to be prevented, neither is it in the
reach of the Wit and Power of Man to put a
stop to it by any other Means but by effectu∣ally
preventing and prohibiting the wearing,
and use of them.</P>
<P>I have some other essential Propositions in
Trade, which will come in course to be laid
down for the carrying on this Argument, as
we proceed in the Consideration of these; but
I shall reserve them <HI>in petto</HI> till I see whether
the Age is weak enough to struggle with things
so selfevident as these, and till I see what it
is can be offer'd, <HI>if any thing shall be mu∣stred
up,</HI> against these five.</P>

<HEAD>A brief State of the Question
Between the
PRINTED and PAINTED
CALLICOES,
AND THE
Woollen and Silk Manufacture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT the IMPORTATION of
Wrought Silks and Printed Cal∣licoes
from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and
allowing the use of them here
when imported, has all along been found
prejudicial to the Home Consumption of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures in <HI>Great-Britan,</HI>
needs no other Proof than the late
Acts of Parliament, which were obtain'd in
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Consequence of the general Application of
the <HI>Manufacturers,</HI> as well Masters as Work∣men,
through the whole Kingdom, to pro∣hibit
and limit their Consumption.</P>
<P>In doing this, the Parliament, whose
Wisdom and Justice was very conspicuous
in that very Case, entred into the true Me∣rits
of the Cause, search'd it to the bottom,
and weigh'd the Allegations on every side.
The Members were neither clamour'd into
it by the <HI>Weavers,</HI> byafs'd to it by Parties,
or hurry'd into it by the multitude of Pe∣titions
from the Counties and Corporations
they represented; but the Weight of the
Cause supported it self; the Nature of the
Thing pleaded it, and their own well∣weigh'd
Reason importun'd them to it: The
thing was self-evident; the Humor of the
People, <HI>as too often is the Fate of Nations,</HI>
seem'd, at that time, possess'd against their
Interest, and being hurry'd down the Stream
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
of their Fancy, they ran headlong into the
greatest Neglect and Contempt of the
Growth and Manufactures of their own
Country and People, and embrac'd, with
a Violence in their Temper not to be re∣sisted,
the Silks and Callicoes of <HI>India,</HI> in
a manner even ridiculous to themselves, as
well as fatal to their Interest.</P>
<P>The Extravagance of that Time cannot
be so entirely forgot, as that we should not
reflect how the Ladies converted their Car∣pets
and Quilts into Gowns and Petticoats,
and made the broad and uncouth Bordures
of the former serve instead of the rich La∣ces
and Embroideries they were used to
wear, and dress more like the Merry-An∣drews
of <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, than like the
Ladies and Wives of a Trading People.</P>
<P>The Consequence was, what any one
might thave foreseen would be, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the
Ruin of our Manufactures, the stagnating
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
of our Trade, the stop of Employment, and
the starving our Poor: The Cry was uni∣versal,
not the <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> Weavers only,
selt it; the Calamity was general, and the
Complaint came from every Corner of the
Nation.</P>
<P>As all Mischiefs in their Exorbitance tend
naturally to their own Cure, so it was hear;
seeing the thing was fatal in it self to our
Trade, it was our Felicity that it run on to
such Extremes as allarm'd the whole King∣dom;
for this awaken'd the Parliament to
its Redress; Such we cannot but hope will
be the Case again; for like Causes generally
produce like Effects.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of the Legislature might
pass with us all, for Reason, in a Case of
much more Consequence than this; but we
have yet more powerful Auxiliaries to bring
in Aid of the Case before us; I'll insist
upon two only, 1<HI>st,</HI> The Pattern of our
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Neighbours; 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Success of our own
Prohibitions. I begin with the last.</P>
<P>What the Parliament did in the Cafe I
just now mentioned, was abundantly justify'd
in the Success: What can be more encou∣raging
to apply the same way, seeing the
Cafe is the same?</P>
<P>No sooner was the Flux of foreign Manu∣factures
stopp'd and the <HI>East-India</HI> Goods
prohibited, but the Trade reviv'd; the Face
of Things chang'd; Business and Plenty
succeeded to want of Employment, and
want of Bread; the Numbers of Poor flock∣ing
to the Manufactures for Employment,
and the Encrease of the Consumption of
our Manufactures reviv'd the whole Nation.
Nothing could be a stronger and more
convincing Evidence of what had been
alledg'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the so general wearing
and using <HI>East. India</HI> printed Callicoes, &amp;c.
had been the Ruin of our Trade, had put a
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
stop to the Employment of the Weavers,
and, in a word, had <HI>starv'd our Poor.</HI> I
shall come to this again in its Place.</P>
<P>I come, in the next place, to the Exam∣ple
of our Neighbours, and particularly
the <HI>French,</HI> a Nation but too wife in the
most proper Methods for erecting and en∣couraging
Manufactures; of which there
are such Testimonies given in the Admini∣stration
of Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> who was just∣ly
call'd, <HI>The Father of the</HI> French <HI>Manu∣factures,</HI>
as we have felt the Consequences
of in Trade for many Years past.</P>
<P>The <HI>French East-India</HI> Company was E∣stablish'd
by the enterprising <HI>Genius</HI> of the
said Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> in the Year 1664, and
the Edict pass'd the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>th of <HI>August</HI> 1686,
settling all their Privileges for 50 Years;
and they begun with great Advantages, tho'
they had not Success, occasioned by their
own Mismanagement: However, the King
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
of <HI>France,</HI> finding the using and wearing
of <HI>India</HI> wrought Silks, Cottons, and Cal∣licoes
painted and printed, whether in <HI>In∣dia</HI>
or at Home, began to encroach upon
the Manufactures of his Subjects, as well
Silk as Wool; and fore-seeing that it would
be the Ruin of both, for which he thought
himself oblig'd to preserve the utmost Con∣cern,
as being the Fundamental of the Ri∣ches
of his Kingdom, he effectually prohi∣bited
the Wearing and Use of them, whe∣ther
printed at Home or Abroad, among his
Subjects, by an Edict in the Year 1686,
and under very severe Penalties: And the
late King of <HI>France,</HI> being mov'd by his
Council of Trade, from time to time, by
several subsequent Edicts, confirm'd those
Prohibitions, adding farther Penalties, more
severe than before, for enforcing the Exe∣cution:
By all which it appears, of what
Consequence this Matter was thought to be
for the preserving the Manufactures of his
own Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
The Government of <HI>France</HI> proceeding
still upon the same Maxims, of a just Policy
in Trade, continue as Tenacious of their
former Care for their own Manufactures as
ever: And this appears by the Provision
made by subsequent Edicts to continue the
same Prohibitions, in the strictest manner,
of all such <HI>East-India</HI> Goods as are hurtful
to their Manufactures, of which the follow∣ing
is a flaming Instance: (<HI>viz.</HI>) We all
know, that the present Government has u∣nited
their old <HI>East-India</HI> Company to their
new <HI>West-India</HI> Company; and what great
Advances of Credit that Union has made in
<HI>France</HI>; yet, so far is the present Govern∣ment
from neglecting their own Manufa∣ctures,
by forgetting to prohibit the Use of
the Callicoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the said Company
may import; and so far are they from ima∣gining
that the said Company should not
flourish and thrive, notwithstanding the
Prohibition of those Goods, tho' so consi∣derable
a Branch of their Importation, that
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
those Prohibitions are all expresly renew'd,
repeated and confirm'd, by the Edict of Re∣union,
as appears by the IXth and Xth Ar∣ticles
of the Grant to the said new Esta∣blish'd
Company, as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Artic.</HI> IX. 'We permit the said Com∣pany
to import from the Countries within
their Grant, all sorts of Stuffs of pure
Silk, and of Silk and Cotton mix'd with
Gold and Silver, Bark of Trees, and
Callicoes dy'd, painted and strip'd. We
require, that the said Merchandizes pro∣hibited
in this Kingdom may not be sold,
but on express Conditions of being export∣ed
to foreign Parts, and that for this End
they may be laid up in the Ware-Houses
of our Farmer-Generals, under two Keys,
of which the Farmer-General, or his De∣puties,
shall keep one, and the Directors of
the Company, or their Substitutes, the o∣ther;
and that all other necessary Precau∣tions
be taken to hinder the Sale of the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
said Merchandize for Domestick Consump∣tion.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Artic.</HI> X. 'The said Company may also
import, from the Countries within their
Grant, all forts of White Callicoes, Raw
Silks, Coffee, Drugs, Spices, Metals, and
other Things, except those prohibited by
the preceeding Article, paying the Duties
which are actually paid by the <HI>India</HI> Com∣pany,
according to the Edicts, Declara∣tions,
Arrets and Regulations, of the Kings
our Predecessors.'</Q></P>
<P>Here we see the very Thing done in <HI>France</HI>
which we want here; and for the very same
Reasons for which we stand so much in need
of it here; which Reasons we cannot doubt
will subsist with the same Force here as there;
the Foundations of Foreign Import, &amp; Home
Manufactures, being the same, and especially,
because he cannot doubt, but that a <HI>British</HI>
Parliament will appear inspir'd with all the
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
just Principles of Care and Concern for the
Good of our People, and the Prosperity of
our Trade, as the Councils of the late King
of <HI>France</HI> could be for his Subjects.</P>
<P>But I cannot forbear taking Notice here,
how much stronger the Argument is on our
Side for the doing this now, than it ever
was before, even for this particular Reason,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Because the <HI>French</HI> have, upon their
new Establishment, continued their Prohi∣bitions.
I explain my self thus:</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have not only re-establish'd
the <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> but they have put it into
Hands which are not like to neglect it, run
in Debt in the <HI>Indies</HI>; or sell the Liberty
of Trade to others; but they who are now
entrusted with the Privilege, know very
well how to make use of it, and want no
Stock to carry it on: And as they are capa∣ble
both in Knowledge of the Business, and
Stock for the managing of it, so they appear
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
resolute to proceed immediately upon it, and
we are told, they have already taken up four
large Ships for the carrying on the Trade,
and that they talk of taking up several more.
The <HI>Flemmings</HI> under the Inperial Com∣mission
or Charter, are not only doing the
same, but are actually embark'd in the <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade, have several Ships now Abroad
and one great Ship just arriv'd from <HI>India</HI> at
<HI>Ostend,</HI> being the second that they have re∣ceived
since their entring upon that Trade:
And we are likewise told, that the Govern∣ment
of the <HI>Austrian Netherlands</HI> has already
resolv'd on the prohibiting the Consumption
of Printed &amp; Painted Callicoes among them;
and that they will be publickly prohibited
there as they are in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Let any impartial Person then judge,
whether we have not just Reason to be
allarm'd at these Measures, while we lie
open to a smuggling Trade so generally
carried on thro' this whole Kingdom, and
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
so impossible now to be prevented: Whither
must the vast Quantities of Callicoes which
thess two new <HI>East-India</HI> Companies will
import, I say, Whither must they go?
Whither but to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
<HI>Ireland,</HI> where the People are so fond of
them, and where it is so easy to get them
on Shore.</P>
<P>Our <HI>East-India</HI> Company has already
shew'd themselves apprehensive of Success
of the new Establish'd Imperial Company in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> nor can they be justly unconcern'd
at the setting up a Company in <HI>France,</HI>
upon so potent a Stock as that of 50 Mil∣lions:
But what then have we not to fear
for our Woollen and Silk Manufactures,
which are so oppress'd already with clan∣destine
Importations of Silks and Callicoes
from Abroad, as well as Printing them at
Home, and when the <HI>French</HI> will not fail
to bring in Quantities equal to the Opportu∣nities
which they have to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind them?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
We may appeal for this, to any one that
is acquainted on those Shores of <HI>England</HI>
which lie nearest to <HI>France</HI>; are not <HI>French</HI>
Brandies, <HI>French</HI> Wines, and <HI>French</HI> Silks to
be had almost in as great Plenty in our Port-Towns
on that side of the Country, as in
some Parts of <HI>France</HI> it self, and will it not
be the same thing with <HI>India</HI> Goods? Can
<HI>Rumney Marsh</HI> want <HI>French</HI> Callicoes, where
all <HI>French</HI> Goods are, <HI>as it were,</HI> as familiar
to them as in <HI>France?</HI> Can those People
that know how to carry off whole Freights
of Wool, the most bulky of all Merchan∣dize,
be ignorant to take on Shoar <HI>French</HI>
Callicoes, <HI>French</HI> Wrought Silks, <HI>French
East-India</HI> Goods of all Kinds? It cannot be
doubted, but when the <HI>French</HI> come to have
a Quantity of Callicoes always by them, and
no consumption for them at Home, they will
find Ways and Means to croud them in up∣on
us, with much more Ease than they do
now their Wines and Brandies. What the
Consequence of this will be to our Wool∣len
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
and Silk Manufactures, is very plain:
They must be destroy'd nothing can pre∣vent
it.</P>
<P>These Things serve to let us see, that the
present Debate is not the Concern of a few
People in <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> only, tho' their Po∣verty
and Distress happens to be nearest our
View at this time, as their Complaints have
been loudest: But, in a word, the whole
Body is effected, the whole Interest of our
Woollen and Silk Manufactures throughout
the Kingdom is concern'd in it; I mean, as
to those Goods which concern our Wearing
Apparel and Furniture, which is the Bulk
of our Manufactures; nay, the <HI>East-India</HI>
Company themselves are concern'd in it;
and, I believe, it might be very easy to
prove, by a just Calculation, that if these
Companies now set up in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
prosper and thrive, as it is more than
probable they will, the <HI>East-India</HI> Company
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will suffer more by their
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Importing their Callicoes here, and thereby
sharing the Trade with them, or rather
taking it from them, then they will, by the
general putting a stop upon the Consumpti∣on,
and thereby checking the Foreigners
in their beginning; so that upon the whole
of the two, the Prohibition seems to me
to be no Evil at all, but, rather an Advan∣tage
to them.</P>
<P>It was, without question, an unaccount∣able
Mistake in those who sollicited the first
Prohibition of <HI>India</HI> printed Callicoes, that
they contented themselves with prohibiting
the Use of Callicoes printed Abroad, but
did not insist upon prohibiting the Wearing
and Use of those printed at Home, as Things
in themselves equally ruinous to our Manu∣factures;
they had not then left the Door
open to the Printing and Painting them in
<HI>England,</HI> a Trade then scarce known; under
colour of which, all sorts of Callicoes, where∣soever
printed, have been worn here, and
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Foreigners thereby encouraged to pour them
in upon us by the Arts of clandestine Trade,
and our People impose upon us by re-landing
their own; in which, by the way, the known
and wilful Perjury that attends it, is one of
the least Things in our Consideration.</P>
<P>But now the Work is to be done over a∣gain,
with this Difficulty in the Difference,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that now we have the Pretences of
the <HI>Callicoe Printers</HI> to struggle with, their
calling the Callicoes a Manufacture, because
Painted and Printed here; tho' these are in
themselves meer Trifles, like that of the Num∣bers
of Families employ'd in Printing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
I say, Trifles, when compar'd with the Ma∣nufactures
themselves which we plead for,
and the Numbers of Families and People
maintain'd by, and employ'd in them; of
which I believe I am not arrogant, when I
say, it is ridiculous to talk of any Proportion.</P>
<P>The Work has also another Difficulty in
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
its way, or rather a pretended Difficulty;
that is to say, I foresee that some People in∣tend
to call this a Difficulty, I mean, the
Fund form'd upon the Stamps on Callicoes,
appropriated, perhaps, to such or such Uses,
or as Security for such and such Loans:
But as all those Funds are, to our great
Satisfaction, made redeemable by Parlia∣ment,
we have no more to do but to convince
our Representatives of the Necessity of re∣deeming
them, and leave the House, which
is the in exhaustible Fund of Funds, to their
own Methods for finding an equivalent Se∣curity
to the Satisfaction of the Lenders;
and yet, even in this Point, when the House
shall legitimate such an Attempt, something
may be said farther.</P>
<P>Difficulties therefore are no Discourage∣ment,
where absolute Neccessity is the Mo∣tive:
The Thing carries an apparent Neces∣sity
in it; it must be remedied, or our Trade
must be Ruin'd, our Manufactures be at an
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
End, and our poor not sent a Begging on∣ly,
but indeed be Starv'd. And here,
were it any thing to the Purpose, I could
spend some time in Exclamation, at the
preposterous unthinking Humour of our
People, who, upon all Occasions, run di∣rectly
counter to their Interest, as a Trad∣ing
Nation, in so visible and so evident a
manner as this of wearing Printed Callicoes;
or, at least, wearing them so as to make it an
universal Mode. We often see Clothiers,
Drugget-Makers, Sergemakers, Stuff-makers
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> dress themselves and their Families
in the Cloth, or Druggets, or Serges, or
Stuffs they make; and tho' they may not
be so very like their Neighbours, they will
give this ready Answer, (<HI>viz.</HI>) '<HI>Tis my
own Trade; 'tis my own Manufacture.</HI> And
the Answer is allow'd to be very rersona∣ble;
Why should it not be a National An∣swer,
as well as a Family Answer? Why
should not an <HI>English</HI> Man, or an <HI>English</HI>
Lady, reject foreign and destructive <HI>Gew∣gaws,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
and chusing to wear the Woollen and
Silk of our own Product and Manufacture,
give this for a Reason for it, <HI>Tis our own
Trade; 'tis our own Manufacture.</HI></P>
<P>Let us go to the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>Chineses</HI>
for Instruction, as <HI>Solamon</HI> sends the Sluggard
to the Ant: Are they prevaild with to lay
by their own Manufactures for any of Ours?
No; 'tis evident, we are so far from being
able to place any of our Manufactures among
them, that they despise the Proposal; and
refuse to sell those Goods, which we have
<HI>so little need of,</HI> but for that ready Money,
which we have <HI>so little need to part with.</HI></P>
<P>But this is a large Field; I refer it to the
Time when the Battle shall be more closely
join'd; then we may find time to talk more
feelingly of the Folly of carrying Money to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> to buy that, which we ought
rather to give Money to be without.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who, as un∣capable
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
as they may be to judge of their Na∣tional
Interests, are yet wiser in this part, by
the Strength of meer Nature, than we are,
who pretend to so much Knowledge; for
they wear their own Manufactures; not can
we bring them to alter the manner of their
Cloathing, any more than the Matter of it.</P>
<P>Some have alledg'd for a Reason of this,
the Climate in the <HI>Indies</HI> being suited to the
Manufactures they make; and that nothing
can be so light, so clean, so pleasant in such
hot Countries, as the Callicoes and Silks of
their own making: But we might very well
answer this, by giving the Patterns of
our fine Stuffs; some of which, as well as
the manner of wearing them in hot Coun∣tries,
are much Cooler, and much more
suited to the Heat of the warmest Climate,
than the uncouth Fassions, great Sleeves
and pleated Gowns of the <HI>Indians</HI> who even
load themselves, rather than dress them∣selves
with their Callicoes and other Manu∣factures
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
of their own Make. Any Traveller
might be left to judge of this, who has seen
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Peru,</HI> at <HI>Lima,</HI> at <HI>Panama
Carthagena,</HI> and such-like hot Places, where
they dress much cooler and lighter in <HI>British</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> Stuffs and Cloth, nay, even in
<HI>English</HI> Black Bayes, than the <HI>Indians</HI> on the
Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> and <HI>Coromandel,</HI> or in the
Bay of <HI>Bengale,</HI> do in their Silks and Cal∣licoes;
but Nature dictates to these Nations
to cultivate their own Produce, to con∣sume
their own Manufacture, and en∣courage
their own Commerce: And Nature
would dictate the same thing to us, if we did
not obstinately put out Nature's Eyes, and
act against Nature, in the pursuit of the
most untractable part of our Faculties, I
mean, Humour and Fancy.</P>
<P>Certainly, if we were free from this Trade-Frenzy,
and were to act by the Dictates of
Common Sense, we should reflect, that the
Woollen Manufacture is the Staple of our
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
ginal Fountain of our Wealth, and, as I said
in my <HI>Introduction,</HI> it is <HI>the most essential part
of the Riches of the Rich, and the principal
Means we have for the employing our Poor.</HI>
Many things might be said to prove, and
some to illustrate whatever is contain'd in
these Generals, concerning our Woollen-Manufacture;
but I am loath to suppose my
self talking to any People so ignorant as not
to know it, or so partial as not to acknow∣ledge
it. If I can meet with any <HI>Englishman</HI>
so weak as to dispute it, I undertake, at
Demand, to expose them, and prove my
Proposition, both at once.</P>
<P>The Premises then being granted, my In∣ference
is as just, namely, <HI>that it is the com∣mon
Interest of the whole Kingdom to discou∣rage
every other Manufacture, so far as
those Manufactures, ruinous</HI> to, <HI>and incon∣sistent</HI>
with <HI>the Prosperity of</HI> our Own.</P>
<P>The late King of <HI>France,</HI> who so well un∣derstood
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
the Interest of his Subjects in Trade,
is a standing Authority for this very thing:
All the Edicts publish'd in <HI>France</HI> on this
Subject, such as in the Year 1686, and in
1689, and in 1697, prohibiting the Printing
and Painting of Callicoes in <HI>France,</HI> and the
selling Callicoes Printed or Painted in <HI>India</HI>
when Imported into <HI>France,</HI> are fortified
with this Reason, as sufficient to justify
their Government in the said Prohibition.
(viz.) <HI>that they were prejudicial to the Ma∣nufactures
of Wooll and Silk, already esta∣blisbed
in</HI> France.</P>
<P>And there are two things in those Edicts
of the King of <HI>France</HI> which are very re∣markable,
and which I reserve for farther
Explanation, if I find occasion to speak in
this Cause hereaster; I say, two things are
very remarkable in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s
Prohibitions and Limitation of his <HI>East-India</HI>
Company's Trade, which stand as
Precedents for our Practice; the same Rea∣sons
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
being much more strong and forcible at
this time in our Circumstances, than they
could then be in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That in the Edict or Arret, prohi∣biting
or forbidding the Painting &amp; Print∣ing
of Callicoes in <HI>France,</HI> is also included a
strict Prohibition of the Painting and Print∣ing
any kind of Linen Cloath of Hemp or
Flax, tho' such Linen was the Growth and
Manufacture of his own Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That in his Limitation of the
importations of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company,
there is this Clause; That whereas the
Company were allow'd to import some cer∣tain
Wrought Silks, named in the Edict, to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, so,
<HI>first,</HI> they were oblig'd to bring in no more;
and, <HI>secondly,</HI> they were oblig'd, in consi∣deration
of that Liberty only, I say, they
were obliged to export to the <HI>Indies</HI> the
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
value of 500000 Livers a Year in Goods of
the Growth and Manufactures of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And even this Condition did not continue
long; for the Council of Trade there, consi∣dering
that the consumption of the Manu∣factures,
was by no means an Equivalent
for the Injury those Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' but to
the value of 150000 Livers a Year, did to
the Manufactures of <HI>France,</HI> that Grant was
also revok'd and the Goods entirely prohi∣bited,
under the most rigorous Penalties,
as they continue to be this Day.</P>
<P>These two Clauses are of such moment in
the Case before us, and dictate so clearly
not only what we have to seek, and what
to complain of, with respect to our Maun∣factures,
and to our <HI>East-India</HI> Company,
but also the Reasons of it, that I cannot
but think it very much for the Publick Ser∣vice
to publish the sevral Edicts, in which
these Clauses, and the Reason and Causes
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
given for them are contain'd, accordingly
they are plac'd in the Close of this
Work.</P>
<P>Thus I have touch'd at the Heads of this
Matter, and have pass'd them over without
other Enlargments then such as the present
Occasion makes necessary. This Essay, <HI>for
it is no more,</HI> is but a Specimen of the Con∣troversy,
every one of these Heads having
necessary Explanations attending them, and
long debated Points of Commerce to speak
to, in order to set the whole Affair in a
clear Light; all which it may be to the pur∣pose
to enlarge upon hereaster.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, I cannot dismiss this
Affair, without turning a little to the Trad∣ing
part of Mankind, and especially the
Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures in this
Nation: 'Tis not a little strange to observe,
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
how unconcern'd we sit, and seem to enjoy
our selves in a perfect composure of Mind,
and a most inimitable Tranquility; when our
general Commerce, by which we all subsist,
langushes, and, as it were, expires in our
sight. At Home, foreign Manufactures en∣croach
upon us; Abroad, they are prepa∣ring
new Projects to attack us; and as they
seem united to Undo us, so, I must say,
we seem unanimous in the Resolution of
being Undone.</P>
<P>How can we sit still and see the Bread
thus taken out of our labouring Peoples
Mouths, even by those very Men who ought
to be equally concern'd with us to prevent
it? The Wearing and Use of Callicoes, is
evidently the Ruin of our Manufactures:
If we can distinguish between the Manu∣factures
and the Manufacturers; if the Em∣polyment
can be lost, and the Workmen
not suffer; if the Trade can die, and the
Tradesmen live; then I have no Foundati∣on
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
for my Discourse, no Reason for this
Expostulation.</P>
<P>Nay, if this was a particular Article of
Trade only, if a few Families were to be
ruin'd of this or that particular Employ∣ment
only, and the main of our People
not be effected with it; we might be silent,
and the Opposers might say, we made more
Noise of it than there was occasion for.</P>
<P>But since the Evil is general, and the Mis∣chiefs
which attend it are so spreading, that
the whole Nation is more or less effected,
from the Gentleman of the greatest Quality
and Estate, to the meanest Wool-cumber,
and that we are inevitably to feel the Con∣sequences
of it: How can we, I say, sit un∣concern'd,
and see out Families impoverish'd,
and the Foundation laid for the Ruin of our
Posterity, and yet take no Notice of it? It
is certainly our Concern, in a more particu∣lar
manner, to APPEAR, not in Arms, not
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
in Mobs and Tumults, that neither is a
lawful Way of Appearing, nor would it
give the least Aid in the Matter. Trade
is the Daughter of Peace, and draws its
principal Nourishment from the publick
Tranquillity: No Men in their Senses can
propose raising Tumults and Riots for the
promoting Trade, neither is it the way to
engage the Government, the Parliament,
or the Ministry, to redress our Grievances
in Trade. Such violent Ways only arm
Power against us, and engage Governors to
be our Enemies. My Arguments all run
another Way, and if I mistake not, have
ten times more Force in them with wise
Governments, than all the Clamours of a
Rabble can suppose to have.</P>
<P>I move you first to see the Mischief: To
that end, I set it in a clear Light, prove
the Fact, shew you the slow degrees by
which the Poison works, how insensibly it
grows upon you, and yet how sensibly some
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
parts of Trade feel it already, and how cer∣tainly
all other parts will be effected by it.</P>
<P>I move you then to put your Hands to
all Legal Preventions; I aim at no other:
I move you to joyn in all just Representa∣tions,
both of the Mischief and the Remedy,
to those in whose Power it is to relieve you
I mean, your Parliament-Men; your Re∣presentatives;
who, as they are most of them
chosen by the several Trading Corporations
of <HI>England,</HI> may be more particularly call'd
the Representatives of the Trading-Part
of the Nation.</P>
<P>These are the profest Physicians of all our
Trading Maladies; I may say, 'tis their Bu∣siness
to heal you, and I am sure it is in their
Power; represent it to them in Parliament,
and represent it to them out of Parliament;
let them come up to Parliament fairly ap∣pris'd
of the Case; fully convine'd of the
Justice of your Complaints, and the abso∣lute
Necessity there is of relieving you: Let
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
them see it; make them Witnesses, in the
Countries where they live, of the Decay
of the Manufactures; of the Abatement
made upon the Poor in their Wages; of the
Numbers of Poor that desert, and run from
one Work to another for want of Employ∣ment.
Shew them the Rolls of your Pari∣shes,
which, I am satisfy'd, will discover
how many Families, more than ever, are
listed among your Pensioners; for whom
Parish Provision is necessarily made, for want
of their getting Bread by the Works they
were wont to be employ'd in; shew them
the languishing Circumstances of the People,
as <HI>the Effect</HI>; and then lay before them the
languishing Circumstances of the Trade, as
the Cause; then they will come up to Par∣liament
convinc'd of your Distresses,
fully prepar'd to receive your Petitions, and
fill'd with Compassionate Thoughts for your
Redress.</P>
<P>I must consess, this seems to me to be the
most proper Method, to spirit the approach∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
Assembly of Parliament with Sentiments
of Pity for their County, and with a just
Knowledge of the Reallity of, and Reason
for the Complaints you make; and if I
might be allow'd to suppose, that these
Sheets shall any where come to the Hands of
the particular Members in the Manufactur∣ing
Counties and Corporations for which
they serve, I would, with all possible Hu∣mility,
but also with the utmost Importuni∣ty,
petition them to look a little into the
State of the Manufactures in their respective
Countries where they live.</P>
<P>It is without doubt, the just Concern, of
our Representatives, to study the Interest
and the Circumstances of the People who
they represent. If these Gentlemen please
but to look round them, they must of Ne∣cessity
see that the Manufactures decline,
that Trade languishes, and the Poor stretch
our their Hands to them for Help. They
must needs also see the Causes of it, even at
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
their own Doors, while they cannot but see
a wilfully-possess'd Nation, dress'd up in the
Manufactures of Foreigners, and despising
the Workmanship of their own People:
Madly sending their Money to <HI>India</HI> and
<HI>China,</HI> to feed and support Heathens and
Savages; and neglecting, nay, I may say,
Rejecting the Manufactures of their own
Country, tho' they see the poor Families
starving for want of Work.</P>
<P>I press the People in the Countries to lay
open their Case before their Representatives
and convince them of the melancholly Cir∣cumstances
they are in, by the Decay of
Trade, and the Stop of their Manufactures;
and give them a clear View of the Nature
of the Grievance, and whence it proceeds;
and there is no room to doubt, but the
Members would be affected with it, as well
as other Men.</P>
<P>'Tis from the same Principle, that I move
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
the Gentlemen themselves to enquire into
the Case, and make themselves fully Masters
of both the Fact and the Reason of it: Af∣ter
which, I would not suffer it to be nam'd
as a Doubt, but that the natural Concern
every Member of Parliament must have for
the Prosperity of the People he represents,
will move him effectually to apply himself
in Parliament to the Remedy.</P>
<P>'Tis a great Mistake to suggest, that <HI>Spit∣tle-Fields</HI>
alone Complains, or has cause to
Complain; tho', as I said before, the Manu∣facturers
there feel the Burthen sooner; but
all the Country, and almost all the Branches
of the Woollen and Silk Manufactures feel it:
And 'tis easy to shew, why the Town Work∣men
feel the stop of Trade sooner than the
Country Workmen. The Case is this:</P>
<P>The Clothiers, and Drugget or Stuff-ma∣kers
in the Country, who are the head Ma∣nagers
of the Woollen Manufactures, are
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
generally Men of Substance and good Stocks;
they have often whole Towns and Villages
employ'd in their particular Works; and tho'
they do feel a stop of the Trade at Markets,
they do not so immediately put a stop to
their works, but they must keep their Markets
and make their Circuits, to take in the Yarn,
and put out the Wool, or their Neighbours
will break in upon them, their Spinners will
seek Work in other Hands, and, perhaps, not
be gotten again when they may want them.</P>
<P>Thus they go on a great while, tho' the
Goods, when made, do not sell, 'till <HI>Black∣well-Hall</HI>
lies piled up to the Roof with
Goods, and the Wholesale-Men and Factors
Ware-Houses are throng'd with them; nay,
even then they go on, and are forc'd to draw
upon the Factors and Wholesale Dealers for
the Money, whether the Goods sell, or no:
The Factors again are sometimes forced to
sell them to Mony'd-Men under the Price,
and perhaps to Loss; nay, and even some∣times
to pawn or pledge them for Money,
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
in hopes of a Market to come; and still with
the Money answer'd by those Bills, the Clo∣thier
in the Country goes on, as long as he
can get Credit for a Bag of Wool to Work,
or a Penny of Money to pay his VVorkmen:
And this causes the Country Poor not to
feel the Check and Decays of their Trade so
soon as the Town Workmen. But then we
must take this with us, as we go, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
when the Trade droops so long together,
and the Country Manufacturer or Clothier
is forced to stop, 'tis more fatal to the Poor,
<HI>as above</HI>; for then as they are long before
they stop, so they are longer before they
recover, and the Poor are, as it were, en∣tirely
destitute for a great while.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Spittle-Fields</HI> the Case alters; here
the Manufacturers, I mean, the Masters, are
near the Market: They do not put out the
Wool to Spinning, but generally buy it in
the Yarn: As soon is the Market stops, they
stop; if they cannot sell their Work, they
immediately knock off their Looms, and the
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
Journeymen as immediately starve and want
Work. Thus as Distempers near the Heart,
or in the Vital Parts, are sooner and more
sensibly felt, than in the less Noble Parts of
the Body; so the Disease, of Trade, the
Decay and Stop of Sale, is most sensibly
and sooner felt here, than in the Country,
and therefore Here the Complaint is first
made, and loudest.</P>
<P>But this on the other hand, testifies
to us, that if it be not provided for forwith,
if some present Remedy be not apply'd to it,
the spreading malignity will soon extend it
self, and the most extream Part will then
feel it: And what's the Consequence? but
that then the Complaint will come up louder
and be more uneasy to us.</P>
<P>All these things urge us, if possible, to
apply some speedy, some immediate Reme∣dy
to the Evil. What that Remedy is, and
what alone can cure us, I refer to the Sea∣son
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
of it; the present Business is to lay down
the Fundamental, (<HI>viz.</HI>) shew the Disease,
awaken the Nation, open their Eyes to the
Consequences of it, and guide them in their
Applications to the proper Persons, who a∣lone
can take it in hand, and that is, <HI>as a∣bove,</HI>
the Parliament.</P>
<P>Certainly if the Members of Parliament
in the several Countries would but enquire
a little into the Particulars, now they are at
leisure, they would come up big with a De∣sire
to set their helping hand to it; they
would come up fill'd with Resentment at
those who have been Instruments to ruin the
flourishing Trade of their Country and noth∣ing
could influence them against the humble
proposals that may be made to them for re∣storing
the Trade and Prosperity of the King∣dom.</P>
<P>It
is suggested, that all Applications of
this King will meet with a powerfull Oppo∣sition,
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
and that the Manufacturers, however
numerous they are, will not find Friends
enough to carry their Point against the
Wearing and Using the Printed Callicoes.</P>
<P>For my part, I cannot be of this Opinion:
It is true, I have not <HI>told Noses,</HI> as they call
it, or cast up the Strength on either side, or
examin'd who shall be the Friends, or who
the Enemnies of the VVeavers Petitions; but
this I venture to say, that as I have prov'd
the Grievance is National, this, I think
will follow, that none of the Nation's
Friends can be Enemies to the Proposals for
a Remedy. It is our Satisfaction that this is
no Party Cause, unless any one should vilely
insinuate, that there is a Party that would
not have the Manufactures thrive, or would
have the Poor starv'd and perish; and I can∣not
have such ill Notions of any Man as to
think Party can carry them that length;
Trade is a perfect Neuter in all our unhappy
Strife: Spinning and Weaving are neither
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
<HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory,</HI> but the great Articles by
which we live, by which the consumption
of our Produce is carry'd on, and by which
the Poor are subsisted, who without it,
would, in a word, eat us up all.</P>
<P>If this Cause Meets with Enemies; if any
one Man can be found in <HI>Britan,</HI> who
would not have us leave off Painted Feathers,
and stick to our own Manufactures; I say
if one Man can be found so prepossess'd, it
must be either a Man perfectly ignorant in
Matters of Trade, and so not worth talking
to; or it must be some Callicoe Printer, or
his Employer and Dependant, who, find∣ing
his Account in the Mischief, acts upon
the corrupt Principle of being willing to get
Money tho' at the Expence of the Ruin of
his Country; something like the wretched
Sexton of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> in the Year 1665,
who, being employ'd at the <HI>Pest-bouse</HI> near
<HI>Old-street,</HI> would have had the <HI>Plague</HI> con∣tinue,
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
that his Fees might not abate, but that
he might have People enough to Bury.</P>
<P>But let us not fright our selves with the
imaginary Notion of Enemies, and a strong
Opposition: <HI>Nil Desperandum,</HI> let us take
but true Measures, setting the Fact in a clear
light, and convincing our Representatives,
in a peaceable but effectual manner, of the
Weight of the Case, and how justly they
are concern'd, as Representatives, to espouse
the Trading Interest of their Country; I
can never imagine, that any Cabals of Dra∣pers,
<HI>East-India</HI>-Men, Brokers, and Job∣bers
shall be able to byass the Members of a
<HI>British</HI> Parliament against it, or to blind
their Eyes in a Case so clear as this, that
wearing a foreign Manufacture, and despi∣sing
our own, is the most preposterous, tho'
the most certain Method of straving us all,
that can possibly be invented.</P>
