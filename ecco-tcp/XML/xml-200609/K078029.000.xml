<HEAD>AN
ESSAY
UPON THE
Trade to <HI>Africa, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is, no Question, the hardest Thing
in the World, to Convince Men's
Judgments against their Interest, and
persuade Men to Believe, what they
desire should not be true.</P>
<P>This I conceive has been one Cause, why
the <HI>African</HI> Company and the Separate Tra∣ders
have Argued so long against one ano∣ther
to so little purpose; till at last, they
seem to give over Disputing for Conviction
of one antoher, and labour to possess other
Men, with the Reasonableness of their re∣spective
Pretensions; that the World being
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Judges of their Arguments, they that have
the Strength of Reason on their Side may
have most Voices, and make their Cause
most Popular.</P>
<P>But in this they have not been without
their Difficulties, and the Ground they
have gotten on either Side, seems hardly
worth the Noise it has made: This
seems owing Principally to the back∣wardness
of People's making themselves
Masters of the Cause, either on one Side
or other, and perhaps a little to the unhappy
Custom of the Age, <HI>viz.</HI> Of appearing for
or against, as Parties, Prejudices, Friend∣ships,
Examples, or Interests Guide us, ra∣ther
than by the true Method of Enquiring
into the Bottom of Things, and Impartial∣ly
Judging, according to the Weight of their
proper Merit.</P>
<P>We chuse to lay the Blame however, up∣on
the first of these, <HI>viz.</HI> Peoples Ignorance
in the Cause, and hope the Time may
come again, when Men of Sense shall judge
Things as they are, rather than as Men of
Art would make them seem to be: In
hopes of this, and to shorten this Dispute if
possible, these few Thoughts are put into
Print, that Unbyass'd Men may see by a
clear Light, and make a Judgment of Truth
upon the Matter,</P>
<P>In order to this, we shall briefly, and with
all possible plainness, enter a little into the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Merits of the Cause, and search to the
Bottom the Transaction it self, between
the Company and the Separate Traders:
We shall enquire into their Management
of the Trade, as it respects themselves,
the Trade itself, and the Nation: Their
Behaviour to one another, how, and up∣on
what Foundation they have begun
the present War between them; how
they become, as no doubt they now are,
Inconsistent with one another; and how
their present contending Circumstances are
Inconsistent with the Trade it self, and with
the Publick Good of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The Original of the Company is known,
and needs take up none of our Time, only
it may a little concern the present Dispute,
to make this one Remark, <HI>viz.</HI> That they
came in by Purchase, a Just, Lawful, and
Honourable Way; the Circumstances of
the former Company declining, and they
being in no Condition to carry on the Trade;
and the Trade itself appearing then in its
Infancy, to be a most Profitable, Useful, and
absolutely necessary Branch of our Com∣merce;
for these Reasons, the Government
concern'd itself, as no doubt all wise Govern∣ments
will, that so great an Advantage
should not be lost to the Nation.</P>
<P>This they did by Encouraging a new Sub∣scription,
to which his late Majesty K. <HI>Cha.</HI> II.
and his Royal Brother then D. of <HI>York,</HI> after∣wards
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
King of <HI>England,</HI> gave particular En∣couragement,
Subscrib'd a considerable
Stock, was pleas'd to grant a Royal Char∣ter,
Dated <HI>Anno</HI> 1672. from whence they
derive the Title of the <HI>Royal African Compa∣ny;</HI>
this is not repeated in Compliment
to the Company, but for the sake of the o∣ther
part of the Story.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Authority of their
New Foundation, and the Favour of their
Prince, which they had then to so great a
degree as above; yet such was the Respect
had to the Necessity of Possessing the Coast
of <HI>Africa,</HI> by Forts and Castles, and the
Settlement of Factories, for the Manage∣ment
and Security of the Trade; so evi∣dently
did it appear, that without these
Forts, Castles, and Settlements, it was im∣possible
to carry on the Trade, or to pre∣serve
and enlarge it; that this New Com∣pany
were oblig'd to take off these Forts
and Castles, from the Hands of the Compa∣ny
that went before them.</P>
<P>As the Necessity for having these Forts
and Castles for carrying on the War, pre∣vail'd,
so the Sense of Justice to the Old
Company prevail'd; and tho' they were
not able to carry on the Trade, yet no
Thoughts were Entertain'd of taking away
their Property, without a valuable Consi∣deration;
such a Barbarous Thought ne∣ver
entred into the Counsels of those juster
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Nor were the Old Company in all their
most despicable Circumstances, oblig'd to
part with them as Heaps of Materials, and
old Stuff for Building; the Price was not
run down as of old Houses, to be Demo∣molish'd
and good for little, tho' they
were at that Time really in but a mean
Condition, of small Strength, and no way
proportionable to what they are now, or
what the Security of the Trade call'd for.</P>
<P>But they were consider'd at a moderate
reasonable Value between both, as Things
necessary to the New Company, and
that had been very chargeable to the
Old; useful for the Security of the Com∣merce,
and essential to the very Being and
Nature of the Thing: Thus the New Com∣pany
came in upon a very fair Purchase,
and gave at first, in the very Infancy of the
Trade 34000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, for but one of
those very Forts and Castles which are
since that made the Subject of some Peoples
Jest; and which <HI>first</HI> they would have be
thought of no Use to the Trade; but when
that was not to be made out, then they
would have it, that the Number was too
great, and the Value of them but a Trifle.</P>
<P>This is the more needful to be obser∣ved
here, to give all Men leave to take
Notice of the remarkable Justice of the
present Separate Traders who oppose the
Company; who would not only have the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Company's Forts and Castles vallued at lit∣tle
or nothing, but would not have that
little paid them neither, but would have
them taken from them; either by dive∣sting
the Company of their Property upon
a pretended Assignment for Payment of
Debts, or which is equally just, would
have them put into the Hands of the
Government, without making any Satis∣faction
to the present Company for them,
which is little better than endeavouring
to get an Act to make a General Plunder
of the Company's Effects.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but when they pro∣posed
that the Government should have
the Forts and Castles, their Juftice to the
Government was as Eminent as their Justice
to the Company, for they were not to
make any Settled Payment to the Govern∣ment,
for the Expence of Maintaining the
Garrisons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Forts, except a
Certain Rate <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon an uncertain
Degree of Trade; for no Man was to
Export more than he pleased, or to pay
for more than he Exported. These are
Speciments of the Justice of the Treat∣ment
both the Company and the Govern∣ment
were to meet with with from these
Gentlemen.</P>
<P>But to return to the Case in Hand. The
Company having obtain'd a Charter from
the Crown, and their Trade secur'd with
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
exclusive Privileges, suited to its Preserva∣tion
at Home, and with Forts, Castles,
and Settlements, for its Defence Abroad,
went on prosperously for many Years.</P>
<P>If any Persons yet remain'd doubt∣ful
of the Necessity and Advantage of
this Trade, or of the Magnitude it rose to
under the Protection of the several Princes
aforesaid, it might not be amiss to enlarge
here, by telling them, What in the Space of
Twenty Years, or thereabout, they Ex∣ported
in <HI>English</HI> Manufactures; How many
Negroes, they sent to the <HI>English</HI> Colonies
in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> and how many Thousand,
Ounces of Gold they brought into <HI>England,</HI>
beside the Export of Foreign Goods by De∣bentures,
and the Import of many Thousand
Pounds <HI>Sterl.</HI> in Wax, Elephants Teeth, Drugs
and valuable Commodities, the Growth of
the Country there, and necessary to ours
here.</P>
<P>We might tell you how, had this Trade
been neglected and left languishing, as it
has been since, under the Depredations of
Interlopers and Separate Traders, the Ha∣zards
of the War, and Losses at Sea; had
they been worryed, and kept in constant
Alarm by the Attacks and Barking of their
Rivals in the Trade, not a third Part of the
Poor had been employ'd, whom their Trade
kept Alive; not a third Part of the Negroes
had been carryed to <HI>America,</HI> tho' at double
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Price; and not a Tenth Part of the Gold
had been brought in to help our declining
Cash to circulate, in a Time when a long
War had stopt the Channels of Bullion from
<HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>But these Things need not to be enlarg'd
on, they come within every Man's Reach;
and the most ignorant in Trade know them.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the Prosperity of the
Company was such, that they had very
little Debt upon them, an unlimited Cre∣dit,
a full Cash, a vast Stock, and their
Actions run the highest upon a real Bot∣tom
to support them, of any Company that
ever was in <HI>England;</HI> being once Sold at Four
Hundred Pound <HI>per Cent.</HI> being the same
Thing that has since been Sold for Ten
Pounds, or very little more.</P>
<P>This Remark is Needful to let the World
see, that the Great Debt upon the Com∣pany,
which the Separate Traders make
use of as an Argument, why they should
be given up, is meerly occasion'd by the
Convulsions of their Trade, from the In∣vasions
of those very People that Com∣plain;
for that before there were any In∣telopers,
or that they went on with Impu∣nity,
the Company had no need to run
into Debt.</P>
<P>It is true, That during the Reign of
those very Princes, the just Protectors of
this Trade, some Attempts were made by
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Interlopers and clandestine Traders, to
break in upon their Trade: And the Com∣pany
suffer'd always by those Attempts, of
which large Accounts have already been
given by the Company in Print; but
their Right being clear, and that Right be∣ing
always supported by the Publick Good,
and the Justice of the Government, the
Company were enabled to do themselves
Justice upon the said Interlopers; and they
met with such frequent Discouragements,
by the Legal Prosecutions of the Company
in Defence of Right, that the Interloping
Trade gain'd but little Ground of them
for many Years.</P>
<P>It was very hard, that when the Revo∣lution
happen'd in <HI>England,</HI> which was
esteem'd a general Deliverance of the Na∣tion
from Oppression and Injustice, and
Men rejoyc'd every where for the more
free and Legal Possession of their Rights
and Properties, that the <HI>African</HI> Company
should be the Only Sufferer; the only Peo∣ple
that were left in a worse Condition than
before; the only People that seem'd to have
less Security for the Possession of their Pro∣perties,
and to feel more Oppression than
they did before; and that they, of all the
Nation, should have the true Cause of Re∣joycing
at that Great Affair taken from 'em.</P>
<P>But then it was, that from the Revoluti∣on
to the Year 1700, or thereabouts, the
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Interloper, as if the Liberty of doing Wrong
was restor'd among the other Freedoms of
the Nation, by the Revolution, began from
that Time to appear openly; Fit out Ships
here in the Face of Goverment; and appear
on the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> in Defiance of the
Company's Forts, carrying on an open Trade
without Regard to the Laws of the Land
or the Lawful Privileges of the Company.</P>
<P>It could not be, but that such an Open
Invasion of their Trade must be a great
Discouragement, as well as a great Loss to
the Company: Especially, considering
two great Things that attended it, 1. The
subtle but unfair and dishonourable Me∣thods
which these Interlopers took, to car∣ry
on their Trade to <HI>Africa.</HI> Such as Bri∣bing
the Company's Officers and Factors
Abroad; confederating and corresponding
with the Company's Enemies in <HI>Africa,</HI>
whether Natives or <HI>Europeans;</HI> running
down the Price of their Goods to the
Negroes, teaching them the Craft and
Knowledge of the Trade, and how to Buy
and Sell to their Advantage; raising the
Rates of the Slaves they buy; and thus in
every Article rendring the Company's
Trade more difficult to manage, and less
profitable than it was before. 2. The Dif∣ficulty,
and, as it appear'd at last, the Im∣possibility
of obtaining Redress of these
Grievances, or Gaining any New Confir∣mation
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
of the exclusive Privileges, on the
Foot of which their Trade had flourish'd
for so many Years before.</P>
<P>Nay, so far was the Company from re∣ceiving
Assistance at Home, against those
People who daily made Havock of their
Trade, and grew Rich upon the Spoil of
the Company; that on the contrary, the
Impunity of the Times hardened the said
Interlopers to go on, and claim that for a
Right, which they had nothing but their
own Practice to justify; as if the long break∣ing
in upon a legal Constitution had di∣vested
that Constitution of its Foundation.</P>
<P>These Things running to a height, In∣terloping
became Popular, and the Com∣pany
had a just Alarm, from having seen
the Books for a New Subscription to the
<HI>India</HI> Trade laid open, and the Interlopers
of that Trade Incorporated in a distinct
Society: Tho' the Necessity of their re∣turning
into the Hands of the Old Compa∣ny,
soon brought them into a Coallition.
Of which by it self.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>African</HI> Company were al∣larm'd
with this Precedent, if they ap∣pear'd
apprehensive of the like Invasion
of their Trade, and expected every Day
when their Interlopers would be also
Incorporated into a New Company: The
said Interlopers themselves deliver'd them
from that Fear when they soon let them
<PB N="14" REF="13" MS="y"/>
see, that it was not the Setting up against
the Company, but an utter Dissolution of
the Company, and laying open, <HI>Anglicè</HI>
blowing up the Trade, was in their
View.</P>
<P>Not to enter into a Detail of their Pra∣ctices
to this Purpose, which yet are many
and very visible, the Variety of which
would very well bear a History, and long
Accounts of which have been already
made Publick; it shall suffice to note,
that the Company languishing under the
Insolence and Oppression of these In∣vasions,
and at the same time lying
under many discouraging Losses by the
War, resolved (that they might rather
save the Trade to the Nation, than enjoy
the Profits of it) to take them into, what
they could not keep them out of; and ra∣ther
grant something upon Conditions of
saving the rest, than see the whole de∣voured
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who in a short time
would effectually destroy both.</P>
<P>Upon this Principle the Company ap∣ply'd
themselves to the Parliament about the
Year 1698, and obtained an Act to permit
all People who thought fit to Adventure,
to Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI> and from thence to the
<HI>English</HI> Colonies, paying only to the Com∣pany
the rate of 10 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> besides the
ordinary Duties to the Crown: Which Ten
<HI>per Cent.</HI> was of the
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Forts, Castles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for receiving the
Protection of them in their Trade.</P>
<P>It would be worth while here, and in
the pursuit of these Papers We shall not fail,
in order to let indifferent People judge of
the Pretences on both sides, to examine
the Dimensions of the Trade, the Export
and Import from and to <HI>England,</HI> the Num∣ber
of Negroes sent to the Colonies in the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and the Price which is given
there now for them; and comparing these
with the like Article of the Trade during
the Company's free Enjoyment of their
exclusive Privileges, draw a State of the
Difference; that it may be plain to every
Man's Eye, who are or are not the best
qualify'd to carry on this great and advan∣tageous
Trade for the Good of the Nation.
But We adjourn this for a little.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament for Granting this
Liberty of Commerce, upon the Payment
of the Sum aforesaid, has done the Inter∣lopers
one Favour, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That it has le∣gitimated
them under a New Name, dis∣daining
the scandalous Title of Interlopers,
which are indeed but the Raparees or
Highway-men of Trade; They have chri∣stened
themselves by the Name or Title of
10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Men, <HI>alias</HI> Separate Traders,
and by this new Dignity we are to under∣stand
them.</P>
<P>The Company, as it may well be ima∣gin'd,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
under the Torture of this growing
Evil, like a Body under the Weight of a
cruel and incurable Disease, has sensibly
wasted and decay'd, suffer'd innumerable
Inconveniences and Discouragements, e∣nough
to sink them far lower than they are
yet fallen.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Decay of their Trade has
made the Charge of maintaining their Set∣tlement
be an Article that has continually
fed upon their Dead Stock, and eaten long
upon their Capital; the Charge being the
same as when their Trade was most Flou∣rishing;
the 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> which was
allow'd them by Act of Parliament go∣ing
but a very little way to defray the
Charge.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> As they have grown weaker and
less able to protect their Trade, so that
Weakness has happened at a time when
their Strength was most needful; having
not only the Natives on Shore to resist,
but the Enemies of <HI>England</HI> to contend
with, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>And here it is humbly noted, in behalf
of the Company, That their Forts
and Castles indeed were built for the
Defence and Protection of their Com∣merce,
either against the Insults of
the <HI>African</HI> Natives, or the Encroach∣ments
of the Trading Force of other
Nations; such as the <HI>Dutch, French,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/><HI>Danes, Prussians</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI> And
they are able and sufficient to defend
themselves and their Trade against
any or all of them, as Traders. But
it is own'd, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French,</HI>
or any other come to make War with
us, and send regular Forces, Squa∣drons
and Armies, we are not pre∣par'd
for such Work as that. It can∣not
be expected, a private Society of
Merchants can be at an Expence for
it, or Maintain Garrisons to defend
such Forts as might resist in such a
Case; nor could any of those Nations
resist ours in like Circumstances.</P>
<P>And therefore they have suffered irrepa∣rable
Damage and Losses by the Attacks
which the <HI>French</HI> have made upon them
during this War; by which several of their
Forts and Settlements have been destry'd,
their Effects plundred, their Servants and
Factors carried away, and the Charges
laid out, as well as the Trade it self, lost
together.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> They have sustained other Great
Losses, both at Sea and Land, unusual;
and they believe to any Society of
Men in Trade, intollerable; such as</P>
<P>Taking their Ships by the Enemy,
the Hurricane at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> &amp;c.
the Descent of the <HI>French</HI> upon
the Islands of <HI>Mevis</HI> and St. <HI>Christo∣phers,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and by Shipwreck; all which
put together, as they have represent∣ed
it to the Government, amount to
above 400000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>The Company's being reduc'd to great
Difficulties and Extremities under all this,
can be strange to no Body; nor is it to be
wondred, that to keep themselves up, and
to preserve a Trade in it self so benefical, in
hopes at one time or other to recover them∣selves
by the Favour and Assistance of the
Government, they have call'd in great
Sums of Money out of the private Estates
of the Adventurers; and owe great Sums
upon the Common Seal of their Company.
Of all which things the Separate Traders
make their present Advantage; as if the
Distresses and Difficulties the Company la∣bours
under, were a good Reason why
there should be no Company at all. Where∣as,
were the Company set free from the
Assaults and Encroachments of these Py∣rates,
and restor'd to the legal Privileges
of their Charter, they would soon both re∣store
themselves by the Trade, and restore
the Trade to the Nation.</P>
<P>If we were permitted to Argue for the
Company, by the usual Topicks which en∣force
things in other Cases; the Heavy
Losses, the Difficulty and Dissasters, which
the Adventurers and Creditors have had in
all these Particulars; the several Sums of
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Money call'd in, the long time they have
been out of both Principal and Interest,
would be of some weight to move those in
whose Power it lies to re-establish them,
that by a fair honest Application to the
Trade they might restore their Affairs and
make up their Losses again; Especially
when the giving them such Preferences,
consists with the preserving and securing
the Trade, to the Advantage of the Na∣tion.
But on the contrary, the Clamours
of these People, have made the very Mis∣fortunes
of the Company Arguments to
ruin them; as if the Creditors of a Tradse∣man
should be excited to be more severe
upon him than they would be, because he
has had his House Burnt, or because
Thieves have Broke up his Shop and
Robb'd him, which Distaster would move
Men of Reason to Forbear and Encourage
him.</P>
<P>But much stronger will this Argument
be, when it shall appear in the Company's
Favour, that private Interest, Plunder of
the Company's Effects, and violent taking
away the Property of other Men, appears
to be the chief View of the Separate Tra∣ders;
and that they are so far from aim∣ing
at the Publick Advantage, by securing
the Trade to the Nation, that on the con∣trary,
they do not pretend to give, nor
are they able to offer any Security that
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
can be Depended upon to that purpose,
and by the Nature of the thing, it seems
morrally Impossible, but the Trade must
dye in their Hands, and be Irrecoverably
Lost to the Nation.</P>
<P>This short Abstract of the Company's
Affairs brings us down to the present
Times; and this is the true Design of
making it thus Public; also it gives any
one that pleases impartially to consider it,
a clear View of the true Rise and Founda∣tion
of all the Diseases of the <HI>African</HI> Trade,
with the Capacity the Companies Ene∣mies
are in to hurt them, and by Conse∣quence
a View of the proper Remedy for
those Disasters.</P>
<P>From this brief Account also Answers
will indeed form themselves to most of
the Cavils of the present Opposers of the
Company; as to the Usefulness, the Ne∣cessity,
and the Right of Property which
the Company have in the Forts in <HI>Africa;</HI>
it will convince the impartial Reader,
as to the several Circumstances of the Com∣pany,
and their Incapacity either to carry
on the Trade, or to satisfie their Creditors;
also as to the Nature of the Trade, and
whether laying it open, or limiting it, is the
best Method to preserve it; of which the
Separate Traders themselves have made
woful Experiments; and as to several o∣ther
Objections, to which we shall speak
their Turn.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
The Company languishing under these
Difficulties, finding it in vain to struggle
any longer with their Misfortunes, and re∣solved
to put it to the trial, whether they
or the Separate Traders had most Right
to, and the best Plea for the Trade; and
very loth both the Trade it self should sink
and be lost to the Nation, Humbly ap∣ply'd
themselves to the Parliament in the
Year 1709. by their Petition setting forth
their Circumstances, Praying a Confir∣mation
of their Priviledges, and an Esta∣blishment
of their Company, as then de∣sign'd
for a New Subscription.</P>
<P>In the Pursuit of this Petition, the Com∣mons
having referr'd it to a Committee of
the whole House, and the Separate Tra∣ders
having also petition'd to be heard a∣gainst
them, several Hearings were ob∣tain'd
on both Sides; wherein the Persons
who appear'd for the Separate Traders,
treated the Company with all the Indigni∣ty
and Indecency that they could possibly
beftow, consistent with the Place they were
in; bringing their own Servants to betray
the Secrets committed to them, when un∣der
Pay and Employment; betraying the
Privacies of Conversation, and Letters of
Friendship; and all possible Methods were
us'd to blacken the Company's Proceedings
of which nothing more need be said than,
this, That they had the full Satisfaction of
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
doing the Company's Reputation some
Harm, and convincing the World they had
no Regard at all to their own; some of
their Witnesses not sticking to own the
greatest Villanies, upon a Supposition that
they should have it believ'd, that the Com∣pany
had approv'd of them, as done in
their Service. But failing in producing
either Authority from, or Approbation
of the Company in such Things, they
effectually branded themselves first, and
yet failed in the main Design of Reproach∣ing
their Masters.</P>
<P>The Pleadings, or rather Scoldings, on
both Sides being over, and the Separate
Traders having, as they thought, brought
their Business to an Issue; in the Midst of
their Triumphs, they run themselves upon
a Rock which split their Cause; And be∣ing
Shipwreck'd to all Intents and Purpo∣ses,
the Parliament broke up, without be∣ing
able to do any thing for them, or in∣deed
without their putting themselves into
a Condition to make it possible for that
Parliament to do any thing for them, or
they to expect it; unless they had expected
the House should have acted against their
own Judgment, against the Sense of the
People, against the Nature of the Thing,
and against the Interest of the Whole Na∣tion;
and thus like the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> at
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
<HI>Villa Vitiosa,</HI> they got the Victory, but
they lost the Day.</P>
<P>It is true nevertheless, that how much
Reproach soever their Cause obtain'd, and
how ill soever they lookt in the Eyes of in∣different
Men; And tho' their Failing at
last overthrew them, and caused the House
to drop their proposed Chimaera of a Com∣pany
and no Company, of which we may
speak hereafter: Yet the Negative this
Delay gave the Company in their propos'd
Establishment, left them and the Trade
with them in the same languishing Condi∣tion
they were in before, or rather worse.</P>
<P>The Rock which as is said Shipwreckt
the whole Project, and in midst of their Tri∣umph
split all their Cause, was this; the
Want of being able to propose a real and
substantial Security for the Preservation of
the Trade, to the Nation. This was al∣low'd
to be necessary, as without which
the House could not make any Thing that
was to be done for them rational: But when
all their Proposals were lookt into, not the
Security it self only was missing; but no
Foundation or possible Foot upon which
any such Security could be form'd was to
be found; at which some of their best
Friends grew very much asham'd of their
Cause, and appear'd no more in their Be∣half,
for Fear of being oblig'd to blush for
them.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Nor was this Rock an Error of Pilotage,
which with better Conduct they might
have avoieed: It was not a Rock under
Water, or in the Dark: It was an open
Plain and Mountain-Difficulty. They saw
it clearly; every Body told them of it; the
publick Prints warn'd them of it; the Au∣thor
of the <HI>Review</HI> banter'd them with it,
and challeng'd them to avoid it if they
could. But their Cause would steer no
other Course; it was built upon Possibili∣ties
hardly possible, and split upon the Pro∣babilities
hardly probable.</P>
<P>And indeed the relating this Historically,
seems to be the most Convincing and the
Keenest way of Arguing that can be made
use of in this Case. The Company were seem∣ingly
Cast in their Cause, the Stream both
in the House and elsewhere was against
them; the Separate Traders cry'd <HI>Victoria,</HI>
and thought the Day was their own: Why
did they not then obtain the Settlement
their own Way? Why did not the Parlia∣ment
do the Work as they desired? Why
were not the Schemes they offered put into
a Bill and brought to the Vote? The Rea∣son
was Plain, and will be a Reason for
ever, neither that Parliament did, nor
any Parliament with their Eyes open
ever can Establish them, or set up the
Trade their Way, (Viz.) Because they
proposed no Foundation to make it ratio∣nal,
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
no Substance to build on, nothing
that look'd like a Security for the Nation,
<HI>And why did they not?</HI> The Answer is Plain,
they did not because they could not, the
Men were not Fools, but the Nature of the
thing would not bear it, the Proposal had
nothing of that kind in it, it was impossi∣ble,—and
it is so still, <HI>let them do it if they
can,</HI> and no Man can be so Unjust to any
Parliament as to think they will ever settle
the Trade without such a Security.</P>
<P>However this was, yet as above, it
the left Company's Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iness undone, and
their Affairs unsettl'd, a Thing, which,
as it was fatal to them, so it seem'd to
be the utmost that the other People ex∣pected,
as what they suppos'd would at
last be the Ruin of the Company, with∣out
any Help: And no doubt they took
their Aim here much righter than they
did in any Thing else; some of them ha∣ving
been heard to say, They car'd not
whether the Parliament did any Thing or
no, provided they did but delay the Com∣pany;
for then they knew the Thing would
fall into their Hands of Course, the Com∣pany
not being able to stand of themselves,
without some Act was passed in their Fa∣vour,
which they had nothing to do but to
prevent.</P>
<P>It is true, This Prospect seem'd more
rational to them at that Time, than it has
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
done since; and they had but too much
Reason for that wicked Suggestion.</P>
<P>The CASE was this:</P>
<P>The Company had taken in Great Sums
of Money upon Bonds, under their Com∣mon
Seal at Interest, after the Rate
of Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> the Whole amounting to
near 200000<HI>l.</HI> Several Proposals for the Sa∣tisfying
this Debt had been made by the
Company; all which, however well found∣ed,
were rendred Abortive by the Practices
of these People call'd Separate Traders; and
not only so, but many of them bought up
the Company's Bonds, that so becoming Cre∣ditors,
they might both by the Authority
of their Bond, as well as Example, prevent
the Creditors coming into any such Propo∣sal
however reasonable.</P>
<P>Several of these Bonds were put in Suit
against the Company, and some very hard
Things done on those Heads, which we care
not to repeat, because they may oblige us
to descend to Personal Reflections, which
shall be avoided as much as possible.</P>
<P>By these Prosecutions the Company's Af∣fairs
were still farther embarrass'd, their
Commerce interrupted, their Ships stopt,
their Effects attach'd, and all possible In∣sults
offer'd them upon every Occasion, as
well to perplex and discourage them in their
Affairs as to run down their Credit, and in
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
the End oblige them to break up and
dissolve.</P>
<P>To counter-act these wicked Designs and
if possible to defeat them in their Grand
Hopes, the Company set on Foot several
Proposals, at several Times, to their Cre∣ditors.</P>
<P>1. A Proposal of assigning over their
Forts, Factories, and Settlements, with
all their Quick and Dead Stock, into a
New Subscription, at a certain Rate, in or∣der
to have both the said Stock and Im∣provement
apply'd to the Payment of their
whole Debt, as well Principal as Interest.</P>
<P>2. A Proposal of a certain Majority of
their Creditors in Number and Value, be∣ing
impowered to accept such Terms and
Proposals as the Company should make
for the Payment of their whole Debt with
Interest, and that the rest should be bound
by such Agreement.</P>
<P>3. A Coallition or Encorporation of
their Debts with the Stock of the Compa∣ny,
for the Carrying on the Trade: The
Conditions of those Proposals, Especially
the last, were so fair, and the Design
so visibly Honest; so Calculated for the Sa∣tisfaction
of the Creditors, and the Preser∣vation
of the Trade together, that the
Town was for some time in hopes none
could have stood so much in their own
Light, as to have refused them, and a very
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
great Number of the Creditors came rea∣dily
into them.</P>
<P>But it could not be Expected that the
Separate Traders, who were Creditors,
whether by real Original Loan, or Politick
Purchase as aforesaid, and had another
Game to play, would comply with these
or any other Proposals for the Preservation
of that, which it was manifest they de∣sign'd
to Destroy; and therefore the Dif∣ficulty
in these Proposals were many.—The
Separate Traders both openly, by stan∣ding
out themselves in their Bond Capacity;
and underhand by their Private, but since
known Solicitations, used their utmost
Endeavours to prevent this Design, <HI>however
fair,</HI> coming to any Head.</P>
<P>The Company finding that in the Con∣clusion
their Affair in Parliament, was
like either to be delay'd, <HI>the Session draw∣ing
near a Close,</HI> or to go against them
in the House; Presented a most Humble
Petition to the House, tending to the Sa∣tisfaction
of their Creditors, setting forth
the reasonableness of Improving their Ef∣fects
in the best manner possible for that
End, and Praying that what the Majority
in Number and Value of their Creditors,
might agree to, might bind the rest; a Fa∣vour
granted to Private Traders, in case of
their Losses and Dissasters, and thought
to be much more Reasonably expected here
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
The Separate Traders on the other hand,
get some of themselves, being Bond Credi∣tors
as well as Separate Traders, to Petiti∣on
against this, Praying to have the Com∣pany
Divested of their Estate in their Forts
and Castles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to have those Forts
and Castles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Vested in the Cre∣ditors,
with Power to Sell them, towards
Satisfaction of their Debts.</P>
<P>These were certainly the first Creditors
that ever Petitioned that they might have
but part of their Debt, when they might
have had the whole; but the Design was
Evident, <HI>as for the Honesty of it I shall let
that alone,</HI> (Viz.) that this was the only
Turn they could give to the Company, by
which they might come at what they wan∣ted,
(Viz.) a Possession of the Forts and
Castles; for had these Gentlemen obtained
a Power to sell the said Forts and Castles,
as by such an Act of Parliament would have
been given them, they had no more to do,
but to Sell them to themselves at such Sum
or Price, as they should think fit, and the
Affair had been at an End.</P>
<P>We shall not Venture to say, what pro∣bability
there was; as things run at that
time, of obtaining this Request, however
hard and Unreasonable. But the Session
drawing to an End, there was no time left
for these things, and so the Parliament
broke up and nothing was done in it, but
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
Company was left to struggle with their
own Difficulties, and to languish another
Year in the Decay it was brought to, by
the Particulars aforesaid.</P>
<P>Two Sessions of Parliament past in this
manner, the Proceedings both of the Com∣pany,
the Separate Traders, and of the
House being much the same, and the Con∣clusion
the same, (Viz.) leaving the
Trade unsettled and the Company weaker
and weaker, drawing on, as we may say, to
its Dissolution.</P>
<P>When the Company saw their own Con∣dition
still growing worse and worse, and
no visible Prospect of Relief, by their Ap∣plication
to Parliament, they resolve to try
if they could come to some tollerable A∣greement
with their Creditors, that if pos∣sible
they might put them in a way to be
paid, and at the same time to preserve the
Trade; and this was by making the third
Proposal mentioned, (Viz.) a Coallition
or Encorporating their Debt together with
the Stock of the Company; so that both to∣gether
making one new Fund, together
with such Addition as was proposed in the
Articles of Coallition for the carrying on
the Trade, and this upon the Foot of their
present Charter; that thus being at once free
from the Embarssaments of their Debt, they
might carry on a clear Trade, the Profits
whereof in time, might be supposed to rise
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
high enough to Answer the said Debt and
Stock, as if paid off by the Company.</P>
<P>This New Birth suffered strong Travel in
its bringing Forth, and all the last Year
was spent in vain to effect it; the Separate
Traders having done their utmost to render
it Abortive. But at last it has taken Effect
and appears Perfect. The Creditors have∣ing
their Eyes open to their true Interest,
and beginning to see every Day plainer
than before the Destructive Designs of the
Separate Traders, who constantly opposed
every thing that might tend to the Settle∣ment
of the Company's Affairs, and that
meerly as tending to such Settlement.</P>
<P>And now we see the Creditors and the
Company fully agreed, and joyning in
their Applications to the Parliament, for
Confirming their Agreement, and Esta∣blishing
them as One Company, for the
carrying on the Trade. Now the Cla∣mour
of Creditors is at an End; the Cry
that they cannot pay their Debts is Over;
They Owe nothing, for it is all put to one
Common-Stock, and Creditors and Adven∣turers,
make now One Company. What
the Separate Traders can now have to say
against it, what Pretensions they can make
now to a Right in, or what Demands to a
Share of the Trade, separate from the Com∣pany,
what Security they can give for the
Preservation of the Trade, if they had it;
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
What Assurances of Supplying the Colony's
with Negroes, and at what Price; what
Quantity of Manufactures they will Engage
to carry out of <HI>England,</HI> and what Ship∣ping
to Employ?</P>
<P>These all as material Articles for the
Prosperity of our General Commerce, and
for the Encouragement of our Plantations,
are very proper Questions to be ask'd
them, and no doubt will be ask'd of them
in the House. If they appear then to op∣pose
the Company's Petition, what An∣swer
they give to them and what Deficien∣cies
their Proposals may have as to these
needful Questions, may be considered in a
Second Essay upon this Subject.</P>
<P>In the mean time to finish this Dis∣course,
and that the Gentlemen who are
now to take Cognizance of this Affair,
may have a true Notion of the Case, and a
full Knowledge of what has already pass'd
thereupon, the following Observations,
'tis hoped may be usefully enlarged upon.</P>
<P>First it is to be observed, that upon this
Agreement of the Company and their
Creditors, and their forming a Coallition
for the Carrying on the Trade; All Room
for Complaint against the Company, as
Bankrupt, and as having Drawn in Great
Sums of Money, and run into Debts they
are not able to Discharge, is removed;
and the Arguments Drawn from them
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Turn'd with Advantage against the Sepa∣rate
Traders; and therefore the first step
taken upon it, was to let the Government
know of this Coalition, which was done
by the Creditors Joyning with the Com∣pany
in an Humble Petition to Her Ma∣jesty,
fully setting forth their Circum∣stances,
as now United, and Humbly
Praying Her Majesty's Gracious Assistance,
Encouragement and Protection, for the
Enjoyment of their Trade, Privileges and
Property, on the Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>Together with this Petition, the said
Company and their Creditors subjoyn'd a
Scheme or Proposal, for securing and car∣rying
on the Trade, Exporting Manufa∣ctures
and supplying the Plantations with
Negroes; such Security being as they
think Essential to the Trade of this Nati∣tion;
a Copy of the Scheme is as follows.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="scheme">
<HEAD>The Scheme most humbly laid before the
Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by the
Royal <HI>African</HI> Company.</HEAD>
<P>1. THE Royal <HI>African</HI> Company do
most Humbly Conceive, in Concur∣rence
with their Experience, that the Main∣taining
Forts and Settlements on the Coast
are agreed to be absolutely necessary, for pre∣serving
and improving that Trade, that the
most Effectual and Certain Method for Carrying
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
on that Trade, for Purchasing, Building,
Maintaining and Preserving a sufficient Num∣ber
of Forts and Settlements, for receiving
Grants and making Agreements with the Na∣tives,
for furnishing the Plantations with suf∣ficient
supplies of Negroes at moderate Prices,
for giving a necessary Credit to the Planters
and Contracting for the <HI>Assiento,</HI> or with the
<HI>Portugueze,</HI> can only be Effected by a Company
with a sufficient Joint-Stock.</P>
<P>2. That the Trade may be carried on to the
utmost Extent, the Company be obliged to ex∣port
Annually for the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> in Ma∣nufactures
and other Merchandizes, to the
amount of One Hundred Thousand Pounds
Sterling or upwards; and if it shall at any time
appear, by Application to Your Majesty in
Council, that greater Number of Negroes are
required to be sent to the Plantations, the
Company may be subject to the Direction of
Your Majesty in Council, to Export Annually
such further Value in Goods and Merchandize,
as shall be judged necessary.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>As the Company had always insisted
that their Trade, being a great Trust
from the Nation, ought not to be commit∣ted
to any Hands that could not give a
firm and unquestionable Security, to Pre∣serve
and Maintain it for the Good of the
whole Body; and as they had always in∣sisted
upon the Impossibility of any such
Security being given by Separate Traders,
with an open Trade, in which every Man
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
was at Liberty to Export or not Export
to Trade or not to Trade, as his own Af∣fairs
Directed; so they thought it reasona∣ble
to lay before Her Majesty their Rea∣diness
to give such Security themselves.</P>
<P>This Petition and Scheme being Graci∣ously
received by Her Majesty, and refer'd
to the Lords Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations; and their Lordships having
also received a Scheme from the Separate
Truders; the Company received the fol∣lowing
Order to attend their Lordships
thereupon, with a Paper of Queries hap∣pily
stated by their Lordships to the Sepa∣rate
Traders, and given them to Answer,
which Queries also are as follow.</P>

<P>THE Lords commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, having under their Consi∣deration
the Scheme proposed by the Separate
Traders, for carrying on the Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI>
to which Scheme some Objections are made;

<HEAD>Queries for the Separate Traders to Africa.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHat Security can there be, that the
Trade to <HI>Africa,</HI> if laid open, should
be Preserved, so as to produce a Certain Suffi∣cient
Fund, for maintaining such Forts and
Settlements on that Coast, as shall be found ne∣cessary,
to be vested in, or at any time hereaf∣ter
possessed and maintained by the Crown, for
Preserving, Carrying on and Improving the
Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How will there be a sufficient Stock of
Goods always lying ready in the several Forts,
to be from time to time, as occasion shall re∣quire,
Charg'd or Dispos'd of, for Preserving,
Securing and Encreasing the number of Con∣tracts
and Alliances with the Natives, and the
several Neighbouring Petty Kings of the Coun∣try;
and for Encreasing the number of Forts
and Settlements, as mentioned in the foregoing
Query, with Sufficient and Proper Powers for
those Purposes.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="37" REF="36"/>
3. What have you to say in Answer to what
is Objected, if the Trade be Open, and there
are several Sellers and Buyers of Goods from
<HI>Great Britain</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> that
those Goods will be greatly Depreciated, and
those of the Natives as much Enhanced by
them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To these Queries the Company humbly
Presented, by way of Answer, several
Heads of Observation, and then prepared to
Petition the Parliament once more, in or∣der
to obtain such an Act as may Effectu∣ally
Unite the said Company and Credi∣tors,
and Confirm to them the Antient
Priviledges of their Charter, which Petiti∣on
is now depending before the House, and
all the Reports and Proceedings of the
Lords Commissioners of Trade, and Pa∣pers
relating thereto, are Ordered to be
laid before the House.</P>
<P>This short Re-capitulation of the Af∣fair
seems to carry with it a clear Vindi∣cation
of the <HI>African Company,</HI> and an An∣swer
to all the Objections of their Enemies;
for it is observable, that in most Cases
where Truth is on the Side, a clear rela∣tion
of Matter of Fact is the best Vindica∣tion;
for Truth is always most clearly ex∣plain'd
by it self, and History, rather than
Argument, pleads an Honest Cause best.</P>
<P>The Impartial Reader therefore is re∣ferr'd
to the Matter of Fact, which is thus
faithfully related, and is made Judge of
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
the Merits of the Cause, by being made
Master of the Story. The Company seeks
no better Vindication than the Judgment
of Impartial Men, when those Impartial
Men shall be rightly inform'd; and they
are perswaded that most of the Gentlemen
in <HI>England,</HI> who have appear'd in their
Opinion against them, have done so more
for want of right Information, than any
other Defect.</P>
<P>The Weakness of the Answers, the Cla∣mour
and the Noise, which the Separate
Traders have made, tho' they may have
amused the World a little, have hitherto a∣mounted
to so little, that they have not
been able to obtain One Resolution in fa∣vour
of their particular Schemes; nor have
they been ever able to give One direct
Answer to the first Query before-men∣tion'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> How they can secure the
Trade to this Kingdom, which all Sides
agree, must not be lost?</P>
<P>If, after this, they will proceed to oppose
such clear Arguments, if they have any
thing to alledge against the preserving the
Trade in a Company, and the paying Two
Thousand Families of Creditors a just
Debt, many of whom wou'd be utterly
ruin'd in the Loss. If they have any more
Suggestions, Possibilities and Probabilities
to offer, instead of real Securities, it's hoped
the House will give them their due Cen∣sure,
since there seems nothing to be ask'd
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
but this short Question, <HI>Who can secure
the Trade, and who cannot?</HI></P>
<P>This Question the Separate Traders
could never yet be brought to speak directly
to; in all their Answers, and in all their
Papers, they shift and shuffle it off, they
run out to Clamour at the Company, and
cry out of Monopoly; examine the Defect
of Exportations, and the Decay of the
Trade, and reflect upon the Companies
bad Success; the Reasons of which are all
in themselves, as appears by what has been
said. But not a word appears in all their
Papers given in, or in all their Pleadings
in the <HI>House of Commons</HI> to secure the
Trade; all their Schemes are empty of
this main Point, tho' this is the only Que∣stion
upon which the whole matter turns.</P>
<P>They have sometimes mention'd it when
it has been put so close to them that they
could no longer shift it off; and then they
tell the World, there is no doubt but the
Mony to be raised will be sufficient; and
it is highly probable, and the like. But it
is humbly referr'd to all Impartial Judg∣ments,
whether these are things for a Na∣tion
to be satisfy'd with, and for a Parlia∣ment
to grant an Establishment upon?
Whether the Government in their just re∣gard
for the preservation of the Trade,
ought to depend upon Probabilities and
Possibilities, without a real Security, in a
thing of this Consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
All the Foundation upon which the Se∣parate
Traders have suggested the Trade
should be maintain'd, is, That it being left
Open and Free to all Men to Trade, the
Merchants will launch out into Trade, and
send a great number of Ships and Goods
every Year to <HI>Africa,</HI> out of which a cer∣tain
Mulct, or Fine, shall be laid to raise
Money for the support of their Trade, and
maintaining such Forts and Factories as
they think needful; and this they call a
Security, and indeed this is all the Security
they can propose.</P>
<P>If then this Security be duly examin'd,
and the Uncertainties and Weakness of the
Pretences laid open, it cannot be doubted
but the Honourable Members of Parlia∣ment,
who are not to be supposed easie
to be Imposed upon, will see thro' the
Fallacy, and reject such an Attempt to a∣buse
the Nation, with the just Contempt
that it deserves.</P>
<P>To this End it is humbly recommend∣ed
to the Honourable House of Commons
to observe,</P>
<P>1. It is suggested, the Merchants will
launch out into the Trade when it is laid
Open and Free; and as long as they can
carry it on to their Advantage, we may,
without prejudice to the Argument, grant
they will, or at least may do so.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40"/>
But supposing, <HI>which also is very rational
to suppose,</HI> that a time may come when that
Gain may stop, or cease for a Time: It is
evident to all Men, that the carrying on
the Trade will always depend upon the
Gain of the Trade; and if by the Accident
of War, any Invasion from Neighbours, a∣ny
Difficulties with the Natives, or any
other contingent Casualties, which that
Trade is subject to more than other Trades.
The Gain of the Trade ceases, <HI>the Trade
ceases of course;</HI> and if the Trade ceases,
or declines, the Tax to be raised for the
Maintenance of the Forts and Castles cea∣ses,
or is proportionably reduc'd.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> As the Difficulties of the Trade
decrease, it is evident the Expence of those
Forts and Castles, and Settlements always
encrease; the carrying on Wars with the
Natives, the Exorbitances of Presents, and
Expences among such of them as are to be
kept in Friendship, encrease. If then the
Expences encrease by the same Casualty
that makes the Tax to maintain it decline;
It is a most rational Consequence, that those
two Circumstances tend to a Dissolution of
the Trade.</P>
<P>2. It is suggested, that there is no doubt
but the Money to be raised, will exceed
the Charge of maintaing the Forts and
Castles.</P>
<P>This has been so left to the uncertainty
of a loose Assertion, that it seems to leave
the Case more to be doubted, and is a
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
meer begging the Question of the Com∣pany.</P>
<P>For if no Man is bound to Trade to any
Sum, if no Man is oblig'd to Trade far∣ther
than he pleases, which is just as far as
his Profit invites; if that Profit ceases as
above, why shou'd we think the Man will
Trade? So that instead of not doubting but
the Trade will support it self, it is out of
doubt that it will not, in case of Accident
as aforesaid.</P>
<P>3. As there is no Obligation to any Man
to Trade longer than Advantage prompts
him to it; so the Separate Traders never
yet offer'd, nor can they bring in a Num∣ber
of Men that would be personally bound,
<HI>even tho' the Advantages of the Trade should
continue,</HI> that they would Trade to such
or such a degree. This leaves the Trade
in such an Uncertainty, that no dependance
can be proposed, either for the Encourage∣ment
of our Manufactures, or the Supply of
<HI>Negroes</HI> to our Colonies. Nor is this an
Omission of the Separate Traders; a thing
forgotten by them, or which they may
make up when it is demanded of them.
The House may soon put them to the Test
in these things; they cannot bring a Num∣ber
of Men together that will be bound in
their separate Capacities to do these things,
either to Trade at all, in case of Loss, or
War, or to a certain degree in times of
Peace, and Currency of Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
If these things are so, it is humbly left
to any indifferent Judgement to observe,
upon what Foundation the Trade, if laid
Open, is like to stand. How the Nation
shall be Treated, if by any Accident of
War, or otherwise, the Traders shall de∣cline,
or discontinue their Exports; and
what Condition our Colonies shall be like
to fall into, when no Men are oblig'd by
Authority to supply them with <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>4. By the same Rule there can be no
Security obtain'd from these Free Traders,
as to the Quantity of Goods of the Growth
and Manufacture of <HI>Britain</HI> they will Ex∣port,
or as to the Number of Negroes they
shall carry Yearly for the supply of our
Plantations. Upon both which Articles
the Usefulness of the Trade does depend;
and which is still more, they cannot easily
be brought to stated and certain Prices for
which those Negroes shall be Deliver'd;
but as by their Means the Price of Negroes
has been brought from 20 to 40, and 45 <HI>l.
per</HI> Head, to the great Oppression and Dis∣couragement
of the Plantations; so they
still will be at Liberty by the Scarcity of
their Number, to Extort from the Planters
what Exorbitant Price they think fit.</P>
<P>These things are so Evident, and have
appear'd hitherto so Unanswerable, none
of the Separate Traders, in their Nume∣rous
Papers, having offer'd the least satis∣factory
Reply to them, that there seems
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
no occasion to enlarge upon them. Only
here it may not be amiss to observe,</P>
<P>That in a settled Exclusive Company, all
these Objections are fairly Answer'd; the
Difficulties of the other Trade are all Re∣duced
here to a Certainty, and to a meer
Demonstration. An Establist'd Company
under Privileges and Charters, are Enabled
by their very Constitution, to bring all
these things to a Head.</P>
<P>They Engage to support the Factories
and Settlements; to Carry on the Trade,
whether Loss or Gain; to Defend and
Maintain the Forts and Castles; and tho'
an Inverval of Trade, or Cessation of Pro∣fits
for a Year or Years, were to happen,
they go on; Depending on being better
Gainers heareafter; if Twenty Thousand
Pound Loss falls at a time, they cannot be
Discourag'd; the Trade is sure to be kept
up till better Times return; the Forts and
Castles, tho' Cut off from their Trade by
the Insurrections and Wars with the Na∣tives,
receive their Constant Support and
Supply. This has been the Company's
Case frequently, yet they have never A∣bandon'd
the Settlements; whereas, had
Free Traders been left to have Supported
them, they had long ago been Lost and
Forsaken.</P>
<P>The Company have often, in their
Schemes and Proposals, offer'd, and they
now offer to give real and sufficient Se∣curity
to the Nation to preserve the Trade,
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
by obliging themselves in the Forfeiture of
their Charter, or such Penalties as the Go∣vernment
shall think reasonable, to carry
on the Trade, support the Settlements, and
supply the Colonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They have frequently offer'd to enter in∣to
Stipulations, for Exporting Yearly, a
certain and very considerable Quantity of
Manufactures of the Growth and Produce
of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and to supply the Plan∣tations
with a certain Number of Negroes;
and not only so, but to come to a Reason∣able
Stated Price for the said Negroes, as
well in Times of War as Peace; that so the
Colonies may not only be brought to a Cer∣tainty,
as to the Number, but may be sure
not to be Imposed upon in Price.</P>
<P>This very Part of their Proposal seems
a direct Answer to Two Things, and after
what has been said, it seems something
Wonderful to see them Insisted upon.</P>
<P>1. The Pretence of a Monopoly: All
the Grievance of a Monopoly lies in the
Engrossers of a Trade, being in a Condition
to Impose a Price upon either Buyer or
Seller; which in this Case is effectually
Answer'd; for if they are bound to Export
a certain Quantity of Manufactures, they
are under a Necessity of Buying, and so
cannot Command the Price of the Seller.</P>
<P>If they are Ty'd to a Price of their
Negroes, they cannot Impose upon the
Market where they Sell; and so all Pre∣tence
of a Monopoly ceases of Course.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
And this seems to make the Petitions
from the Merchants and Planters of the
Colonies the more unaccountably strange;
for tho' it is True, that the said Petitions
are Sign'd by but few, and those none of
the most Considerable of either Merchants
or Planters; yet that any should be found
among those who have an Interest in the
Colonies, who shou'd be so Weak thus to
Join in a Petition against themselves, is
really one of the most unaccountable things
in the World.</P>
<P>The Dearness of Negroes is their Grie∣vance,
and the Uncertainty of their Sup∣ply:
For them then to Petition against a
Company who offers Security to bring in
their Full Number, and at such Seasons as
they shall propose, and to lower the Price
to such a Reasonable Rate as they shall a∣gree
to; and this in Behalf of a Set of
Men, who have not only been already the
Occasion of their Scarcity, and of raising
the Prices, but in whose Schemes their
Supply, as well as the Price too, is still left
Precarious and Uncertain.</P>
<P>This is indeed the greatest Discovery of
Infatuation that was ever seen in any thing
that bears the Title of a Merchant, and
makes it Edvident, that the power of Pre∣judice
may sometimes prevail upon Man∣kind,
to blind their Eyes against their own
Interest, and make them <HI>Felo dese</HI> in mat∣ters
of Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>
But this is indeed best Answered, by re∣presenting
to the Members in Parliament,
that this Blindness is not a Judgment from
Heaven, upon the whole Body of the Plan∣ters
and Merchants in the Colonies; but
on the contrary, the Company have an
Humble Petition from the greatest Part and
the most Considerable for Interest, of all the
Planters in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to the Honour∣able
House of Commons, humbly represent∣ing
the Necessity of Establishing the said
Trade in an Exclusive Company, under such
Limitations as shall be necessary, as being
the only way to secure and preserve the said
Trade to the Nation, and to reduce the Ex∣orbitant
Rates of Negroes in the Colonies,
which is now imposed upon them by the
Separate Traders.</P>
<P>By all which Arguments it seems beyond
Contradiction, that the only way to secure
and preserve this Beneficial Trade to this
Nation, is to settle it upon a firm Founda∣tion,
in a Company with Exclusive Privi∣ledges,
and yet to have those Exclusive
Priviledges under such Limitations and Re∣gulations
as may remove all the Scandal
and Suggestions of Monopolies, Engross∣sings
and Unfair Trading; that the Trade
may be once more restor'd to its former
flourishing Circumstances, and both the
Nation at home and the Colonies abroad,
may be made Easy and be Gainers by the
Trade, which can never be as it now stands.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
The Justice in this to the Company
who have suffer'd so Deeply in the long
Contention with their Supplanters.</P>
<P>The Justice in this to the Creditors, who
have now Voluntarily and Unanimously
Come in, and Given up all their Debts to
