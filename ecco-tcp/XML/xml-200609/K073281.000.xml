<HEAD>THE VISION. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TWAS on the fatal Day that claims a Sigh</L>
<L>From ev'ry Heart, a Tear from ev'ry Eye;</L>
<L>Ere <HI>Albion</HI>'s Joys were wholly snatch'd away,</L>
<L>Or <HI>Britons</HI> for their Queen forbid to pray:</L>
<L>While Hope and Fear contended in my Breast,</L>
<L>Intruding Sleep my weary Eyes opprest:</L>
<L>Wrapt in a Vision,—where I cannot say,</L>
<L>Nor can the Muse the glorious Place display:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
It seem'd some blessed Angel's happy Sphere,</L>
<L>(Or blessed Angels might inhabit there;)</L>
<L>For sure the beauteous Scene did far excel,</L>
<L>What Heathen Bards of blest <HI>Elysium</HI> tell.</L>
<L>A Cloud of Glory shone before my Face,</L>
<L>Which shed refulgent Rays around the Place,</L>
<L>And scatter'd Colours, various to behold,</L>
<L>Here blushing Rubies, there the burnish'd Gold.</L>
<L>As, wond'ring at the Scene, I gazing stood,</L>
<L>(Struck with religious Awe, that chill'd my Blood)</L>
<L>I saw BRITANNIA, with dejected Air,</L>
<L>Pale was her Face, dishevell'd was her Hair:</L>
<L>Her trembling Hand had dropt the Laurel Bough,</L>
<L>A mournful Cypress wreath'd her pensive Brow:</L>
<L>Before the shining Cloud she prostrate lay,</L>
<L>And thus she pray'd, or seem'd, at least, to pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" ALMIGHTY Father! whose Commanding Pow'r,</L>
<L>Can hasten, or adjourn, the fatal Hour;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Can lengthen, or contract, a Monarch's Reign,</L>
<L>Or raise the silent Dead to Life again:</L>
<L>Oh! stop thy threat'ning Arm, and spare awhile</L>
<L>One sacred <HI>Life,</HI> so precious to my Isle.</L>
<L>For Royal CAROLINA'S Health I sue,</L>
<L>The best of Sov'reigns, and of Subjects too;</L>
<L>In ev'ry State her Goodness has been prov'd,</L>
<L>When rul'd, obedient; and when ruling, lov'd.</L>
<L>Securely blest, beneath her gentle Sway,</L>
<L>'Tis Happiness to serve, and Pleasure to obey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOR fewer Charms adorn her private Life,</L>
<L>The tend'rest Mother, most submissive Wife;</L>
<L>Who never yet her Consort disobey'd,</L>
<L>By Honour, Duty, Love, and Virtue sway'd:</L>
<L>In Virtue's Path she constantly proceeds,</L>
<L>By Virtue's Rule she measures all her Deeds.</L>
<L>Ev'n now, tho' tortur'd with severest Pains,</L>
<L>Her patient Tongue adores Thee, not complains.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
To Thee her ardent Pray'rs and Praises tend,</L>
<L>On Thee, on Thee alone, her Hopes depend;</L>
<L>Firm Faith and Patience fortify her Mind,</L>
<L>To live, indiff'rent; or to die, resign'd.</L>
<L>Yet spare her longer from her heav'nly Throne;</L>
<L>Spare her, for others Good, tho' not her own.</L>
<L>Look down, and see her duteous Children's Tears;</L>
<L>Look down, and hear the best of Monarch's Pray'rs:</L>
<L>See, round her Bed her tender Offspring kneels,</L>
<L>While ev'ry Pang her Royal Consort feels.</L>
<L>Nor only <HI>They</HI> intreat Thee for her Breath,</L>
<L>Three Kingdoms beg Thee to avert her Death:</L>
<L>Religion, Learning, Art, and Science fear</L>
<L>To find a Period, and a Grave with Her.</L>
<L>For Her, the Widows weep a briny Tide;</L>
<L>For Her, whose Bounty has their Loss supply'd:</L>
<L>For Her, unhappy, helpless Orphans mourn,</L>
<L>And shed more Tears than o'er their Parents Urn;</L>
<L>Their Parents Death they need no longer grieve,</L>
<L>Might CAROLINE, their better Parent, live;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Who feeds the Hungry, succours the Distrest;</L>
<L>And from Oppression rescues the Opprest.</L>
<L>Ev'n in the Height of Power her Power was shown</L>
<L>In Acts of Love and Mercy like Thy own.</L>
<L>Oh! were She like Thee more in ev'ry State;</L>
<L>Oh! were She, were She, like Thee, free from Fate!</L>
<L>But <HI>That,</HI> alas! is not to Mortals giv'n;</L>
<L>Yet surely <HI>This</HI> is in the Grant of Heav'n:</L>
<L>Increase her Days, restore her native Bloom,</L>
<L>Nor crop the Royal Fruit till <HI>Autumn</HI> come.</L>
<L>Few are the Years to Mortal Man assign'd,</L>
<L>Ah! let not Her—to fewer be confin'd:</L>
<L>But stop thy threat'ning Arm, and spare awhile</L>
<L>Her sacred Life, so precious to my Isle."</L>
<L>She said: The Tears ran trickling as she spoke;</L>
<L>While from the radiant Cloud these Accents broke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" BRITANNIA, cease thy fruitless Tears, and know,</L>
<L>One certain Day is fix'd for all below:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
That Day permit to Heav'n; for Heav'n alone</L>
<L>Knows when the noble Work of Virtue's done.</L>
<L>Few are the Years, you say, of human Kind;</L>
<L>But Years add nothing to the perfect Mind.</L>
<L>Improperly, by <HI>Time,</HI> you count the Date;</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>virtuous Actions</HI> make a Life complete.</L>
<L>Suppose the Sun, that chears your earthly Clime,</L>
<L>Should run his destin'd Course in half the Time,</L>
<L>Performing all the Offices of Light,</L>
<L>Of Heat, of circling Seasons, Day and Night:</L>
<L>Say, Could you think his Race too swiftly run?</L>
<L>Or, Could you call him an imperfect Sun?</L>
<L>Heav'n's greatest Lord, that over All presides;</L>
<L>Who rules that Sun, and all his Motions guides;</L>
<L>In Length of Years an Equal ne'er survey'd;</L>
<L>But is not <HI>therefore</HI> worshipp'd, or obey'd:</L>
<L>His <HI>Goodness</HI> only claims that Tribute due;</L>
<L>His Goodness, not his <HI>Age,</HI> tho' ever New.</L>
<L>If then, your gracious Queen, tho' few her Days,</L>
<L>Has practis'd ev'ry Virtue worthy Praise,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
Worthy immortal Bliss: What can she more,</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n again her former Health restore?</L>
<L>Tho' Heav'n a Thousand added Years bestow,</L>
<L>Her Soul can be no perfecter below.</L>
<L>'Tis Time She now should quit her mortal Throne,</L>
<L>To change an Earthly for a Heav'nly Crown.</L>
<L>And, see! She mounts Triumphant to the Skies,</L>
<L>Of all her Virtues reaps the glorious Prize!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STARTING to hear the fatal Sentence spoke,</L>
<L>With trembling Joints, and streaming Eyes, I 'woke.</L>
<L>When strait I hear Complaints from ev'ry Tongue,</L>
<L>On ev'ry Face a Cloud of Sorrow hung:</L>
<L>Sad Sighs and Floods of fruitless Tears bemoan</L>
<L>The Noblest Queen that ever grac'd a Throne.</L>
