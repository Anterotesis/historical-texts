<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable <HI>RICHARD</HI> Lord Visc<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>COBHAM.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>ES, you despise the Man to Books confin'd,</L>
<L>Who from his Study rails at human kind;</L>
<L>Tho' what he learns he speaks, and may advance</L>
<L>Some gen'ral Maxims, or be right by Chance.</L>
<L>The coxcomb Bird, so talkative and grave,</L>
<L>That from his Cage cries Cuckold, Whore and Knave,</L>
<L>Tho' many a Passenger he rightly call,</L>
<L>You hold him no Philosopher at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet the Fate of all Extremes is such,</L>
<L>Men may be read, as well as Books, too much.</L>
<L>To Observations which our selves we make,</L>
<L>We grow more partial for th' Observer's sake;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
To written Wisdom, as another's, less:</L>
<L>Maxims are drawn from Notions, those from Guess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There's some <HI>Peculiar</HI> in each Leaf and Grain;</L>
<L>Some unmark'd Fibre, or some varying Vein:</L>
<L>Shall only Man be taken in the gross?</L>
<L>Grant but as many sorts of Mind, as <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There are above 300 Sorts of Moss observed by Naturalists.</NOTE>Moss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That each from other differs, first confess;</L>
<L>Next, that he varies from himself no less:</L>
<L>Add Nature's, Custom's, Reason's, Passion's strife,</L>
<L>And all Opinion's Colours cast on Life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet more; the Diff'rence is as great between</L>
<L>The Optics seeing, as the Objects seen.</L>
<L>All Manners take a tincture from our own,</L>
<L>Or come discolour'd, thro' our Passions shown,</L>
<L>Or Fancy's beam inlarges, multiplies,</L>
<L>Contracts, inverts, and gives ten thousand dyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Depths who fathoms, or our Shallows finds?</L>
<L>Quick Whir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and shifting Eddies of our minds?</L>
<L>Life's Stream for Observation will not stay,</L>
<L>It hurries all too fast to mark their way.</L>
<L>In vain sedate Reflections we would make,</L>
<L>When half our Knowledge we must snatch, not take▪</L>
<L>On human Actions reason tho' you can,</L>
<L>It may be Reason, but it is not Man:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
His Principle of Action once explore,</L>
<L>That instant 'tis his Principle no more;</L>
<L>Like following Life thro' Creatures you dissect,</L>
<L>You lose it, in the Moment you detect.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft, in the Passions wild rotation tost,</L>
<L>Our Spring of Action to our selves is lost:</L>
<L>Tir'd, not determin'd, to the last we yield,</L>
<L>And what comes then is master of the field.</L>
<L>As the last Image of that troubled heap,</L>
<L>When sense subsides, and fancy sports in sleep,</L>
<L>(Tho' past the recollection of the thought)</L>
<L>Becomes the stuff of which our Dream is wrought;</L>
<L>Something, as dim to our internal view,</L>
<L>Is thus perhaps the cause of all we do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In vain the grave, with retrospective Eye,</L>
<L>Would from th' apparent <HI>what</HI> conclude the <HI>why,</HI></L>
<L>Infer the Motive from the Deed, and show</L>
<L>That what we <HI>chanc'd,</HI> was what we <HI>meant,</HI> to do.</L>
<L>Behold! if Fortune, or a Mistress frowns,</L>
<L>Some plunge in bus'ness, others shave their Crowns:</L>
<L>To ease the Soul of one oppressive Weight,</L>
<L>This quits an Empire, that embroils a State:</L>
<L>The same adust Complection has impell'd</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHARLES V. PHILIP II.</NOTE><HI>Charles</HI> to the Convent, <HI>Philip</HI> to the Field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not always <HI>Actions</HI> shew the Man: we find,</L>
<L>Who does a Kindness is not therefore kind;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Perhaps Prosperity becalm'd his Breast;</L>
<L>Perhaps the Wind just shifted from the East.</L>
<L>Not always humble he who seeks Retreat,</L>
<L>Pride guides his Steps, and bids him shun the Great.</L>
<L>Who combats bravely, is not therefore brave;</L>
<L>He dreads a Death-bed like the meanest Slave.</L>
<L>Who reasons wisely, is not therefore wise;</L>
<L>His pride in reas'ning, not in acting lies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But grant that Actions best discover Man;</L>
<L>Take the most <HI>strong,</HI> and <HI>sort</HI> them as you can:</L>
<L>The <HI>few</HI> that glare, each Character must mark,</L>
<L>You balance not the <HI>many</HI> in the dark.</L>
<L>What will you do with such as disagree?</L>
<L>Suppress them, or miscal them Policy?</L>
<L>Must then at once (the Character to save)</L>
<L>A plain, rough Hero turn a crafty Knave?</L>
<L>Alas! in Truth the Man but chang'd his Mind,</L>
<L>Perhaps was sick, in Love, or had not din'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ask how from <HI>Britain Caesar</HI> made retreat?</L>
<L><HI>Caesar</HI> perhaps had told you, he was beat.</L>
<L>The mighty <HI>Czar</HI> what mov'd to wed a Punk?</L>
<L>The mighty <HI>Czar</HI> might answer, he was dunk,</L>
<L>But sage Historians! 'tis your task to prove</L>
<L>One action Conduct, one Heroic Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis from <HI>high Life,</HI> high Characters are drawn;</L>
<L>A Saint in Crape is twice a Saint in Lawn;</L>
<L>A Judge is just, a Chanc'lor juster still;</L>
<L>A Gownman learn'd; a Bishop, what you will:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Wise, if a Minister; but if a King,</L>
<L>More wise, more learn'd, more just, more ev'ry thing.</L>
<L>Court-Virtues bear, like Gems, the highest rate,</L>
<L>Born where Heav'ns influence scarce can penetrate.</L>
<L>In Life's low vale, (the soil the Virtues like)</L>
<L>They please as Beauties, here as Wonders strike.</L>
<L>Tho' the same Sun with all-diffusive rays</L>
<L>Blush in the Rose, and in the Diamond blaze,</L>
<L>We prize the stronger effort of his Pow'r,</L>
<L>And always set the Gem above the Flow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis <HI>Education</HI> forms the vulgar mind;</L>
<L>Just as the Twig is bent, the Tree's inclin'd.</L>
<L>Boastful and rough, your first Son is a Squire;</L>
<L>The next, a Trades-man, meek, and much a Liar;</L>
<L><HI>Tom</HI> struts a Soldier, open, bold and brave;</L>
<L><HI>Will</HI> sneaks a Scriv'ner, an exceeding Knave:</L>
<L>Is he a Churchman? then he's fond of Pow'r;</L>
<L>A Quaker? fly; a Presbyterian? sour;</L>
<L>A smart Free-thinker? all things in an Hour.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>True, some are open, and to all Men known;</L>
<L>Others so very close, they're hid from none;</L>
<L>(So Darkness fills the Eye no less than Light)</L>
<L>Thus gracious CHANDOS is belov'd at sight:</L>
<L>And ev'ry Child hates <HI>Shylock,</HI> tho' his Soul</L>
<L>Still sits at squate, and peeps not from its hole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At half Mankind when gen'rous <HI>Manly</HI> raves,</L>
<L>All know 'tis Virtue, for he thinks them Knaves:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
When universal homage <HI>Umbra</HI> pays,</L>
<L>All see 'tis Vice, and itch of vulgar praise.</L>
<L>Who but detests th' Endearments of <HI>Courtine?</HI></L>
<L>While <HI>One</HI> there is, who charms us with his <HI>Spleen.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But these plain Characters we rarely find,</L>
<L>Tho' strong the Bent, yet quick the Turns of Mind,</L>
<L>Here puzzling Contraries confound the whole,</L>
<L>There Affectations quite reverse the Soul:</L>
<L>The dull, flat Falshood serves for Policy,</L>
<L>And in the Cunning, Truth itself's a Lye;</L>
<L>Unthought of Frailties cheat us in the Wise;</L>
<L>The Fool lies hid in Inconsistencies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the same Man, in vigour, in the gout:</L>
<L>Alone, in company; in Place, or out;</L>
<L>Early at Bus'ness, and at Hazard late;</L>
<L>Mad at a Fox-chase, wise at a Debate;</L>
<L>Drunk at a Borough; civil at a Ball;</L>
<L>Friendly at <HI>Hackney,</HI> faithless at <HI>Whitehall.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Catius</HI> is ever moral, ever grave,</L>
<L>Thinks who endures a Knave, is next a Knave;</L>
<L>Save just a Dinner—then prefers, no Doubt,</L>
<L>A Rogue with Ven'son to a Saint without.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who would not praise <HI>Patritio</HI>'s high desert?</L>
<L>His Hand unstain'd, his uncorrupted Heart,</L>
<L>His comprehensive head? all Int'rests weigh'd,</L>
<L>All <HI>Europe</HI> sav'd, yet <HI>Britain</HI> not betray'd?</L>
<L>He thanks you not; his Pride was in Piquette,</L>
<L><HI>Newmarket</HI>-fame, and Judgment at a Bett.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>What made (say <HI>Montagne,</HI> or more sage <HI>Charron!</HI>)</L>
<L><HI>Otho</HI> a Warrior, <HI>Cromwell</HI> a Buffoon?</L>
<L>A perjur'd Prince a <HI>leaden Saint</HI> revere?</L>
<L>A god-less Regent tremble at a <HI>Star?</HI></L>
<L>The Throne a <HI>Bigot</HI> keep, a <HI>Genius</HI> quit,</L>
<L>Faithless thro' Piety, and dup'd thro' Wit?</L>
<L><HI>Europe,</HI> a Woman, Child, or Dotard rule;</L>
<L>And just her <HI>ablest</HI> Monarch made a Fool?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know, God and Nature only are the same:</L>
<L>In Man, the Judgment shoots at flying Game;</L>
<L>A Bird of Passage! lost, as soon as found;</L>
<L>Now in the Moon perhaps, now under Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ask Mens Opinions: <HI>J * * n</HI> now shall tell</L>
<L>How trade increases, and the World goes well;</L>
<L>Strike off his Pension by the setting Sun,</L>
<L>And <HI>Britain,</HI> if not <HI>Europe,</HI> is undone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Manners</HI> with Fortunes, <HI>Humours</HI> change with Climes,</L>
<L><HI>Tenets</HI> with Books, and <HI>Principles</HI> with Times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Judge we by <HI>Nature?</HI> Habit can efface,</L>
<L>Int'rest o'ercome, or Policy take Place:</L>
<L>By <HI>Actions?</HI> those Un certainty divides:</L>
<L>By <HI>Passions?</HI> these Dissimulation hides:</L>
<L><HI>Affections?</HI> they still take a wider range:</L>
<L>Find, if you can, in what you cannot change?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis in the <HI>ruli ng Passion:</HI> There, alone,</L>
<L>The wild are constant, and the cunning known,</L>
<L>The Fool consistent, and the false sincere;</L>
<L>Priests, Princes, Women, no Dissemblers here.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
This Clue once found unravels all the rest;</L>
<L>The Prospect clears, and <HI>Clodio</HI> stands confest.</L>
<L><HI>Clodio,</HI> the Scorn and Wonder of our Days,</L>
<L>Whose ruling Passion was the <HI>Lust of Praise;</HI></L>
<L>Born with whate'er could win it from the Wise,</L>
<L>Women and Fools must like him, or he dies.</L>
<L>Tho' wond'ring Senates hung on all he spoke,</L>
<L>The Club must hail him Master of the <HI>Joke.</HI></L>
<L>Shall parts so various aim at nothing new?</L>
<L>He'll shine a <HI>Tully,</HI> and a <HI>Wilmot</HI> too:</L>
<L>Then turns repentant, and his God adores</L>
<L>With the same Spirit that he drinks and whores:</L>
<L>Enough, if all around him but admire,</L>
<L>And now the Punk applaud, and now the Fry'r.</L>
<L>Thus, with each Gift of Nature and of Art,</L>
<L>And wanting nothing but an honest Heart;</L>
<L>Grown all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, from no one Vice exempt,</L>
<L>And most contemptible to shun Contempt;</L>
<L>His Passion still to covet gen'ral praise,</L>
<L>His Life, to forfeit it a thousand Ways;</L>
<L>His constant Bounty no one Friend has made;</L>
<L>His Angel Tongue no mortal can persuade:</L>
<L>A Fool, with more of Wit than half Mankind,</L>
<L>Too rash for Thought, for Action too refin'd:</L>
<L>A Tyrant to the Wife his Heart approves;</L>
<L>A Rebel to the very King he loves:</L>
<L>He dies, sad out-cast of each Church and Sate!</L>
<L>And (harder still) flagitious, yet not great!</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Ask you why <HI>Clodio</HI> broke thro' every Rule?</L>
<L>'Twas all for Fear, the Knaves shou'd call him Fool.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nature well known, no Miracles remain,</L>
<L>Comets are regular, and <HI>Clodio</HI> plain.</L>
<L>Yet, in the search, the wisest may mistake,</L>
<L>If second Qualities for first they take.</L>
<L>When <HI>Catiline</HI> by rapine swell'd his Store,</L>
<L>When <HI>Caesar</HI> made a noble Dame a Whore,</L>
<L>In this the Lust, in that the Avarice</L>
<L>Were Means, not ends, Ambition was the Vice.</L>
<L>That very <HI>Caesar,</HI> born in <HI>Scipio</HI>'s Days,</L>
<L>Had aim'd, like him, by Chastity at praise:</L>
<L><HI>Lucullus,</HI> when Frugality could charm,</L>
<L>Had roasted Turnips in the <HI>Sabin</HI> farm:</L>
<L>In vain th' Observer eyes the Builder's toil,</L>
<L>But quite mistakes the <HI>Scaffold</HI> for the <HI>Pile.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In this one Passion Man can strength enjoy,</L>
<L>As Fits give vigour, just when they destroy.</L>
<L>Time, that on all Things lays his lenient Hand,</L>
<L>Yet tames not this: It sticks to our last sand.</L>
<L>Consistent in our Follies, and our Sins,</L>
<L>Here honest Nature ends as she begins.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold a rev'rend Sire, whom Want of Grace</L>
<L>Has made the Father of a nameless Race,</L>
<L>Crawl thro' the Street, shov'd on, or rudely press'd</L>
<L>By his own Sons, that pass him by un-bless'd!</L>
<L>Still to his Wench he creeps, on knocking Knees,</L>
<L>And envies ev'ry Sparrow that he sees.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Salmon's Belly, <HI>Helluo,</HI> was thy Fate.</L>
<L>The Doctor call'd declares all help too late.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Mercy! cries <HI>Helluo,</HI> Mercy on my Soul!</L>
<L>Is there no Hope? Alas!—then bring the Jowl.</L>

<L>(Were the last Words that poor <HI>Naroissa</HI> spoke)</L>
<L>" No, let a charming Chintz, and <HI>Brussels</HI> lace</L>
<L>" Wrap my cold Limbs, and shade my lifeless Face:</L>
<L>" One wou'd not, sure, be frightful when one's dead—</L>
<L>" And, <HI>Betty!</HI> give this Cheek a little Red,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Old Politicians chew on Wisdom past,</L>
<L>And blunder on in Bus'ness to the last;</L>
<L>As weak as earnest; and as gravely <HI>out,</HI></L>
<L>As sober <HI>L * * w,</HI> dancing in the Gout.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Courtier smooth, who forty Years had shin'd</L>
<L>An humble Servant to all Human Kind,</L>
<L>Just brought out this, when scarce his Tongue cou'd stir.</L>
<L>" If—where I'm going—I could serve you, Sir?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>" I give and I devise (old <HI>Euclio</HI> said,</L>

<L>Your Money Sir? "My Money Sir! what all?</L>
<L>" Why—if I must—(then wept) I give it <HI>Paul.</HI>"</L>
<L>The Mannor, Sir?—"The Mannor! hold, he cry'd,</L>
<L>" Not that—I cannot part with that"—and dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And You! brave COBHAM, to the latest Breath</L>
<L>Shall feel your <HI>ruling Passion</HI> strong in Death:</L>
<L>Such in those Moments, as in All the past,</L>
