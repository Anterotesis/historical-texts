<HEAD>CAESAR's CAMP;
OR,
St. GEORGE'S HILL.
A
POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IF lofty hills the tuneful Muse delight,</L>
<L>Ye tuneful Muses hither take your flight:</L>
<L>Forsake Parnassus and your virgin spring,</L>
<L>And soar where Caesar's eagles spread their wing;</L>
<L>When mad Ambition fir'd the warrior's brain</L>
<L>To seek new conquests o'er the British main.</L>
<L>What tho' few laurels on the mountains grow?</L>
<L>A thousand fruitful landscapes smile below;</L>
<L>Where Phoebus' trees perpetual honours wear,</L>
<L>And cedars flourish verdant all the year.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Rich pasture <HI>here</HI> adorns the flow'ry mead,</L>
<L>There golden Ceres waves her bending head;</L>
<L>A mingled scene of profit and delight;</L>
<L>Which chears the peasant, charms the poet's sight,</L>
<L>His sight, which o'er the various prospect roves,</L>
<L>Now pleas'd with gardens, and now pleas'd with groves:</L>
<L>Now wanders over Guilford's lovely plain,</L>
<L>Where the fleet courser stretches every vein;</L>
<L>He paws, he pants, impatient for the chace,</L>
<L>Then sweeps along the scarcely-bending grass.</L>
<L>Not swifter swallows skim along the flood,</L>
<L>To seize the wanton fly, their destin'd food;</L>
<L>Than o'er the plain the nimble coursers bound,</L>
<L>And champ the shining bit, and toss their foam around.</L>
<L>Let lofty Pindar sing the Grecian steed,</L>
<L>Britannia glories in as choice a breed:</L>
<L>As gallant heroes too adorn her coast,</L>
<L>As fam'd Olympia's plain could ever boast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy groves, O! Weston, next the Muse invite,</L>
<L>Thy beechen groves must ev'ry Muse delight.</L>
<L>Here may she tune her lyre beneath the shade,</L>
<L>Or meditate along thy open glade,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Where once she<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The house now Mr. Weston's was formerly Sir Walter Raleigh's.</NOTE> Raleigh's noble soul inspir'd,</L>
<L>When he from business, war, or courts retir'd.</L>
<L>Raleigh! whose actions merit deathless fame,</L>
<L>The nation's glory, and the monarch's shame.</L>
<L>Ah! what avail wit, wisdom, learning, arts;</L>
<L>Superior courage, and sublimer parts?</L>
<L>The wit, the scholar, statesman, hero, sage,</L>
<L>Falls a sad victim to Iberian rage,</L>
<L>Yet still he's pleas'd to see his beauteous grove,</L>
<L>(If aught below can please the bless'd above)</L>
<L>Reward the gen'rous virtue of a son,</L>
<L>Who for a father's good, despis'd his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, when the golden autumn's ripen'd stores</L>
<L>Have plenteously enrich'd the farmer's floors;</L>
<L>Soon as Aurora ushers in the day,</L>
<L>While pearly dews embellish every spray;</L>
<L>The well-breath'd beagles snuff the scented air;</L>
<L>Before them swiftly flies the tim'rous hare.</L>
<L>O'er hills and vales the sprightly coursers bound,</L>
<L>While various-sounding musick floats around.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
The joyous youth pursue the noble chace,</L>
<L>Fresh health and vigor blooming in their face:</L>
<L>Unknown to those who drink the night away,</L>
<L>And waste in dozing idleness the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As o'er the chequer'd landscape Fancy strays,</L>
<L>Nature a thousand sylvan scenes displays:</L>
<L>Plantations rise—the hills and vallies smile</L>
<L>With various groves, that suit the various soil.</L>
<L>Dry rising ground the spreading beech improves,</L>
<L>Wet spungy earth the weeping willow loves;</L>
<L>In vales the stately elms delight to grow,</L>
<L>And pines rejoice upon the mountain's brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So should the parent with judicious care,</L>
<L>(If tender youth with plants we may compare)</L>
<L>Explore the temper of his children's mind,</L>
<L>And six them where their genius seems inclin'd:</L>
<L><HI>This</HI> son delights the flaming sword to wield,</L>
<L>And longs to thunder in the martial field:</L>
<L>A merchant <HI>that,</HI> and plows the foaming main;</L>
<L>While milder natures cultivate the plain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Nor woods alone the pleasing prospect grace,</L>
<L>The Naiads and the Dryads oft embrace.</L>
<L>See, thro' the groves descend the winding streams,</L>
<L>To pay their liquid tribute to the Thames.</L>
<L>First chalky Wey, for rav'nous pikes renown'd,</L>
<L>Rolls thro' the meads and fructifies the ground:</L>
<L>His milky waves enrich the thirsty soil,</L>
<L>And joyous crops reward the mower's toil.</L>
<L>Next gentle Mole thro' shady vallies strays,</L>
<L>And under ground her silent wave conveys.</L>
<L>The Muse shall sing the cause (if fame be true)</L>
<L>And tell what judgments Avarice pursue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mole, once a wood-nymph, beautiful and vain,</L>
<L>Like modern beauties thirsted after gain:</L>
<L>The sordid passion mov'd her to explore</L>
<L>Hills, vallies, rocks, and caves for glitt'ring ore:</L>
<L>And as she o'er the Surry mountains rov'd,</L>
<L>Pan saw the beauteous dame, he saw, and lov'd.</L>
<L>In tender verse he fung his pleasing pains;</L>
<L>And tun'd his oaten pipe to am'rous strains;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Ten thousand fleecy flocks, he cry'd, are mine,</L>
<L>Indulge my flame, my fleecy flocks are thine.</L>
<L>In vain he strives her cruel breast to move,</L>
<L>She scorns alike his musick and his love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next old Sylvanus left his sacred wood,</L>
<L>And smitten with her charms the nymph pursu'd:</L>
<L>Return my passion, lovely maid, he cry'd,</L>
<L>Nor scorn the forests where the gods reside.</L>
<L>In vain he strives her cruel breast to move,</L>
<L>She scorns alike his forests and his love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Apollo next, advancing to the dame,</L>
<L>In tuneful numbers told his am'rous flame:</L>
<L>Long sung the god, and long the list'ning maid</L>
<L>Was pleas'd to hear the courtship Phoebus paid:</L>
<L>Till grasping eager to enjoy her charms,</L>
<L>She swiftly turn'd, and glided from his arms.</L>
<L>When from a cave a dusky Gnome arose,</L>
<L>And various rocks of gold and di'mond shows:</L>
<L>And here, says he, delight your eyes, behold</L>
<L>These flaming jewels, this attractive gold:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Ten thousand treasures in my palace shine,</L>
<L>Love me, ten thousand treasures shall be thine.</L>
<L>So saying, down the cave he shot in haste,</L>
<L>The yielding damsel follow'd him as fast;</L>
<L>Then quickly sunk into his longing arms,</L>
<L>And in a golden grot resign'd her charms.</L>
<L>Apollo, to revenge his slighted flame,</L>
<L>Into a sullen stream converts the dame:</L>
<L>And since she durst despise the god of day,</L>
<L>The god depriv'd her of his chearful ray;</L>
<L>Condemn'd her justly under ground to flow,</L>
<L>And visit mines of glitt'ring dirt below:</L>
<L>'Tis hence her lazy waves impurely glide,</L>
<L>Till Thames refines them in his crystal tide.</L>
<L>Thames, on whose banks a stately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hampton court; which was first built by cardinal Wolsey, en∣larg'd
by K. Henry the 8th, and nobly finish'd by K. William the 3d.</NOTE> frame appears,</L>
<L>Finish'd by glorious William's gen'rous cares.</L>
<L>The stern imperious monarch of our isle,</L>
<L>Eliza's sire, enlarg'd the noble pile;</L>
<L>And made it wear a more majestic face,</L>
<L>Yet still it wanted symmetry and grace:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Till William form'd the spacious courts complete,</L>
<L>Bade strength and order, use and beauty meet;</L>
<L>And rais'd the fabric uniformly great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By equal steps our church and state improv'd,</L>
<L>'Twas Henry first the papal yoke remov'd;</L>
<L>But government, religion and the law</L>
<L>Were settled by the wisdom of Nassau.</L>
<L>For this he bravely cross'd the stormy main,</L>
<L>Whilst adverse winds and waves oppos'd in vain.</L>
<L>When kings deceiv'd with dreams of right divine,</L>
<L>Had stretch'd their pow'r beyond its true design;</L>
<L>When laws and liberty expiring lay,</L>
<L>And Britain mourn'd an arbitrary sway;</L>
<L>Great William, born to succour human race,</L>
<L>Reform'd our government, and fix'd it's base;</L>
<L>Restor'd our laws, made freedom smile again,</L>
<L>And to confirm them bade Augustus reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er Twit'nam bow'rs I next direct my sight,</L>
<L>Where nature, art and elegance unite:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Three graces which on Radnor's will attend,</L>
<L>To deck the mansion of their noble friend.</L>
<L>From hence a lofty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richmond hill.</NOTE> hill attracts my eyes,</L>
<L>Round which a thousand various beauties rise,</L>
<L>Yet tho' it can such various beauties boast,</L>
<L>Extensive bounty dignifies it most.</L>
<L>Rise, Muse, and catch a spark of heav'nly flame,</L>
<L>To celebrate the gen'rous Richmond<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mrs Knipe of Richmond, whose truely christian virtues and ex∣tensive

<L>Who modish pleasures bravely has withstood,</L>
<L>And dares be most unfashionably good:</L>
<L>Who feeds the hungry, succours the distress'd,</L>
<L>Is daily blessing others, daily bless'd.</L>
<L>Nor to their bodies is her care confin'd,</L>
<L>Her care with christian knowledge forms the mind;</L>
<L>Her pious<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Religious books which this lady sends to America.</NOTE> treasures reach remotest lands,</L>
<L>New worlds are bless'd with bounties from her hands.</L>
<L>O! would the deathless Muse my tongue inspire,</L>
<L>Or Phoebus warm me with celestial fire;</L>
<L>To sing her virtues and record her praise,</L>
<L>Her fame should live immortal in my lays:</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
The man of Ross's celebrated name</L>
<L>Should yield in honour to the Richmond dame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not far remote appear the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Richmond gardens.</NOTE> verdant scenes,</L>
<L>The groves which once imbow'r'd the best of queens;</L>
<L>Whose bounty rais'd the meanest Muse's wing,</L>
<L>And bade the poorest bard rejoyce and sing.</L>
<L>While flocks in vernal pastures shall delight,</L>
<L>While sun and moon divide the day and night:</L>
<L>While mem'ry holds her traces in the brain,</L>
<L>My grateful heart her goodness shall retain.</L>
<L>Muse quit the subject, nor renew the tide</L>
<L>Of tears that flow'd when Carolina dy'd:</L>
<L>Then wept the willows, sigh'd the conscious bow'rs,</L>
<L>Then droop'd the myrtles, and decay'd the flow'rs:</L>
<L>Again the flow'rs a blooming aspect wear,</L>
<L>Is she return'd? or is Augusta here?</L>
<L>Yes, here Augusta with her children roves,</L>
<L>A widow'd Venus with her little loves;</L>
<L>Who round their mother fondly sport and toy,</L>
<L>Their mother smiles, <HI>rejoycing in their joy.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<L>Here could the grateful Muse contemplate long,</L>
<L>But other subjects claim the Muse's song.</L>
<L>Windsor, that wing'd the nervous Denham's flight,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with lofty tow'rs attracts the sight:</L>
<L>Where strength and dignity and beauty meet,</L>
<L>Gracefully bold, majestically sweet.</L>
<L>Thy forests, Windsor, equal praises claim,</L>
<L>And <HI>now</HI> shall flourish in immortal fame;</L>
<L>Since GEORGE has thither sent his martial son</L>
<L>To plant the laurels which his valour won;</L>
<L>When on Culloden's field he bravely stood,</L>
<L>'Mid storms of fire and deluges of blood:</L>
<L>Pouring his Father's thunder on his foes,</L>
<L>To rescue Albion from impending woes.</L>
<L>But now rebellious wars and tumults cease,</L>
<L>He cultivates the milder arts of peace;</L>
<L>Embellishes the hills with waving woods,</L>
<L>And thro' the valley leads expansive floods:</L>
<L>Or bids the stately Belvidere ascend,</L>
<L>Or wond'rous arches o'er the water bend:</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Subdues the rude, rough, wildness of the soil,</L>
<L>Adorns the waste with groves, and bids the desart smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice happy had it been for human kind,</L>
<L>Had Caesar thus employ'd his martial mind:</L>
<L>Had he, like glorious Cumberland, subdu'd</L>
<L>His country's foes, then peaceful arts pursu'd,</L>
<L>His hostile eagles ne'er had stretch'd their wings</L>
<L>To ravage Albion, and dethrone her kings:</L>
<L>Nor had the Druids mourn'd their groves, when round</L>
<L>This Hill he form'd his military mound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As thoughts like these revolv'd within my breast,</L>
<L>Intruding sleep my weary eyes opprest;</L>
<L>Yet mimic Fancy still pursu'd her theme,</L>
<L>And painted Caesar present in my dream.</L>
<L>My dream the faithful Muse remembers well,</L>
<L>And what the Muse remembers she shall tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As round this Hill the Roman army lay,</L>
<L>The neighb'ring vale became their destin'd prey:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
To feed them fruitful fields their harvests lend,</L>
<L>To fence their Camp the lofty woods descend:</L>
<L>But while the legions fell'd a sacred oak,</L>
<L>Thus to the chief a captive Druid spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Illustrious Robber! when shall ruin cease?</L>
<L>Thou enemy to property and peace.</L>
<L>Is't not sufficient that your eagles soar</L>
<L>From Asia's empire to Iberia's shore?</L>
<L>But must you shake <HI>our</HI> island with alarms?</L>
<L>Must Britain <HI>too</HI> submit to Roman arms?</L>
<L>Must all our crops be ravish'd from the land?</L>
<L>Must all our forests fall beneath your hand?</L>
<L>Yet tho' they fall by thy ambitious crimes,</L>
<L>Again restor'd, they rise in future times—</L>
<L>I see those future times—I see, with joy,</L>
<L>Those who can faster plant than thou destroy.</L>
<L>Thy Camp, where now embattled legions shine,</L>
<L>Shall bear the spreading beech and tow'ring pine.</L>
<L>Roll swift ye years—produce the men of taste,</L>
<L>To crown with verdant woods the barren waste.</L>
<L>And lo! they come—I see the sylvan swains,</L>
<L>Whose shady groves shall decorate the plains;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
And owe their beauty, many ages hence,</L>
<L>To nature's children, Hamilton and Spence.</L>

<L>Spence shall in Nature's choicest mould be cast,</L>
<L>Of manners gentle, elegant of taste;</L>
<L>In whom the passions shall so sweetly blend,</L>
<L>He ne'er shall make a foe, or lose a friend:</L>
<L>Judicious, learned, and sincere of heart;</L>
<L>Skill'd in the poet's and the planter's art.</L>
<L>Whose care and culture shall rejoice the soil,</L>
<L>And make the gloomy marshes round him smile.</L>
<L>What pleasure shall he feel to form his grove?</L>
<L>To plant new beauties, and the old improve?</L>
<L>To open vistas to the circling hill,</L>
<L>Or wind about his mount the pleasing rill?</L>

<L>Encompassing his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to a field of Mr. Spence's, which he calls the Field of

<L>Prescient of future times, my mental eyes</L>

the parliament of Normandy; and which is, perhaps, the boldest, if

<L>To plant his woods, to spread the lawn, or lead</L>

<L>'Tis thine to ruin, his to serve mankind.</L>
<L>Not far remote a venerable sage,</L>
<L>Woodford, the silver'd ornament of age,</L>
<L>Shall fix his seat in Nature's artless bow'rs,</L>
<L>And there improve his philosophic hours:</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Till hoary Time shall end his studious days,</L>
<L>In peaceful honour, dignity and ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What cannot art and human toil produce?</L>
<L>Converting useless things to public use.</L>
<L>A<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new river, made navigable from Weybridge to Guilford,</NOTE> river o'er that barren heath shall flow,</L>
<L>And vessels swim where pointed thistles grow.</L>
<L>Upon the pleasing borders of the flood</L>
<L>I see a rising hospitable wood:</L>
<L>Where glades shall open, verdant lawns extend,</L>
<L>And northern pines to kiss the elouds ascend;</L>
<L>Where birds and beasts at liberty shall rove,</L>
<L>And future ages call it Cote's grove.</L>
<L>Where wanton fawns shall skip, and tim'rous hares</L>
<L>Shall feed securely and forget their fears;</L>
<L>But ah! their fears return—who gave them food</L>
<L>Pursues them thro' the field and echoing wood:</L>
<L>To hunt the puny prey his bosom glows;</L>
<L>The only cruel joy his bosom knows.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here paus'd the Druid; for his heaving breast</L>
<L>Now swell'd with scenes superior to the rest.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Then thus again—What noble prospects rise!</L>
<L>What majesty and beauty strike my eyes!</L>
<L>The grand and amiable together meet,</L>
<L>The awful terrace and the happy seat:</L>
<L>The slope descending to the plain below,</L>
<L>Where gently winding waters calmly flow;</L>
<L>Till lost in shades, the broad extensive streams</L>
<L>Look like a bending bay of silver Thames.</L>
<L>Here, Nature's boldest beauties are design'd—</L>
<L>Fly swistly, Time—let Lincoln bless mankind.</L>
<L>He comes humanely gen'rous and polite,</L>
<L>In whom the courtier, patron, friend, unite;</L>
<L>Bless'd with a consort, gracefully serene;</L>
<L>Who walks a goddess o'er the vendant scene.—</L>
<L>Wak'd with the pleasing sound of Lincoln's name,</L>
<L>I felt my bosom glow with grateful flame:</L>
<L>For, after many storms and tempests past,</L>
<L>He brought me to this quiet port at last.</L>
<L>My fondest wish was such a rural scene;</L>
<L>The sage's pray'r was such a golden mean:</L>
<L>Above pale Poverty's dejected state;</L>
<L>Below the storms which often wreck the great:</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Remote from giddy crowds, and noisy strife;</L>
<L>Yet near the few, whose converse sweetens life.</L>
<L>Here let me live—be mindful of my end,</L>
<L>Adore my Maker, and enjoy my friend.</L>
<L>That friend to whom—officious Muse forbear,</L>
<L>Nor with distasteful numbers wound his ear;</L>
<L>His ear, too delicate to hear the lay</L>
<L>His virtues claim, and gratitude would pay.</L>
