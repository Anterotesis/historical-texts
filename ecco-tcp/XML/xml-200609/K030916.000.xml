<L>O'er arm Herculean heave th' enormous shield,</L>

<L>With the loud voice of thund'ring JOVE defy,</L>

<L>With partial rage rush forth,—Oh! shame to tell!—</L>
<L>To crush a bard just bursting from the shell?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GREAT are his perils in this stormy time</L>
<L>Who rashly ventures on a sea of Rhime.</L>
<L>Around vast surges roll, winds envious blow,</L>

<L>O'er-run with wit, and destitute of sense,</L>
<L>If any novice in the rhiming trade,</L>
<L>With lawless pen the realms of verse invade;</L>
<L>Forth from the court, where scepter'd sages sit,</L>
<L>Abus'd with praise, and flatter'd into wit;</L>
<L>Where in lethargic majesty they reign,</L>

<L>Ne'er was Lie made which was not welcome there.—</L>
<L>Thence, on maturer judgment's anvil wrought,</L>
<L>The polish'd falshood's into public brought.</L>
<L>Quick circulating slanders mirth afford,</L>
<L>And reputation bleeds in ev'ry word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A CRITIC was of old a glorious name,</L>
<L>Whose sanction handed merit up to fame:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
Beauties as well as faults he brought to view:</L>
<L>His Judgment great, and great his Candour too.</L>
<L>No servile rules drew sickly taste aside;</L>
<L>Secure he walk'd, for Nature was his guide.</L>
<L>But now, Oh strange reverse! our Critics bawl</L>
<L>In praise of Candour with a Heart of Gall.</L>
<L>Conscious of guilt, and fearful of the light,</L>
<L>They lurk enshrouded in the veil of night:</L>
<L>Safe from detraction, seize the unwary prey,</L>
<L>And stab, like bravoes, all who come that way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN first my Muse, perhaps more bold than wise,</L>
<L>Bad the rude trifle into light arise,</L>
<L>Little she thought such tempests would ensue,</L>
<L>Less, that those tempests would be rais'd by you.</L>
<L>The thunder's fury rends the tow'ring oak,</L>
<L>Rosciads, like shrubs, might 'scape the fatal stroke.</L>
<L>Vain thought! A Critic's fury knows no bound;</L>
<L>Drawcansir like, he deals destruction round;</L>
<L>Nor can we hope he will a stranger spare</L>
<L>Who gives no quarter to his friend VOLTAIRE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>UNHAPPY Genius! plac'd, by partial Fate,</L>
<L>With a free spirit in a slavish state;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Where the reluctant Muse, oppress'd by kings,</L>
<L>Or droops in silence, or in fetters sings.</L>
<L>In vain thy dauntless fortitude hath borne</L>
<L>The bigot's furious zeal, and tyrant's scorn.</L>
<L>Why did'st thou safe from home-bred dangers steer?</L>
<L>Reserv'd to perish more ignobly here.</L>
<L>Thus, when the Julian tyrant's pride to swell</L>
<L>Rome with her POMPEY at Pharsalia fell,</L>
<L>The vanquish'd chief escap'd from CAESAR's hand</L>
<L>To die by ruffians in a foreign land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HOW could these self-elected monarchs raise</L>
<L>So large an empire on so small a base?</L>
<L>In what retreat, inglorious and unknown,</L>
<L>Did Genius sleep when Dullness seiz'd the throne?</L>
<L>Whence, absolute now grown, and free from awe,</L>
<L>She to the subject world dispenses law.</L>
<L>Without her licence, not a letter stirs;</L>
<L>And all the captive criss cross row is her's.</L>
<L>The stagyrite, who rules from Nature drew,</L>
<L>Opinions gave, but gave his reasons too.</L>
<L>Our great Dictators take a shorter way—</L>
<L>Who shall dispute what the Reviewers say?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
Their word's sufficient; and to ask a reason,</L>
<L>In such a state as their's, is downright treason.</L>
<L>True judgment, now, with Them alone can dwell;</L>
<L>Like church of Rome they're grown infallible.</L>
<L>Dull superstitious readers they deceive,</L>
<L>Who pin their easy faith on critic's sleeve,</L>
<L>And, knowing nothing, ev'ry thing believe!</L>
<L>But why repine we, that these Puny Elves</L>
<L>Shoot into Giants?—We may thank ourselves.</L>
<L>Fools that we are, like Israel's fools of yore,</L>
<L>The Calf ourselves have fashion'd we adore.</L>
<L>But let true Reason once resume her reign,</L>
<L>This God shall dwindle to a Calf again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FOUNDED on arts which shun the face of day,</L>
<L>By the same arts they still maintain their sway.</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in mysterious secrecy they rise,</L>
<L>And, as they are unknown, are safe and wise.</L>
<L>At whomsoever aim'd, howe'er severe</L>
<L>Th' envenom'd slander flies, no names appear.</L>
<L>Prudence forbid that step.—Then all might know,</L>
<L>And on more equal terms engage the foe.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>
But now, what Quixote of the age would care</L>
<L>To wage a war with dirt, and fight with air?</L>
<L>By int'rest join'd, th' expert confed'rates stand,</L>
<L>And play the game into each other's hand.</L>
<L>The vile abuse, in turn by all deny'd,</L>
<L>Is bandy'd up and down from side to side:</L>
<L>It flies—hey!—presto!—like a jugler's ball,</L>
<L>'Till it belongs to nobody at all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL men and things they know, themselves unknown,</L>
<L>And publish ev'ry name—except their own.</L>
<L>Nor think this strange—secure from vulgar eyes</L>
<L>The nameless author passes in disguise.</L>
<L>But vet'ran critics are not so deceiv'd,</L>
<L>If vet'ran critics are to be believ'd.</L>
<L>Once seen they know an author evermore,</L>
<L>Nay swear to hands they never saw before.</L>
<L>Thus in the ROSCIAD, beyond chance or doubt,</L>
<L>They, by the writing, found the writers out.</L>
<L>" That's LLOYD's—his manner there you plainly trace,</L>
<L>" And all the ACTOR stares you in the face.</L>
<L>" By COLMAN that was written.—On my life,</L>
<L>" The strongest symptoms of the JEALOUS WIFE.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>
" That little disingenuous piece of spite,</L>
<L>" CHURCHILL, a wretch unknown, perhaps might write."</L>
<L>How doth it make judicious readers smile,</L>
<L>When authors are detected by their stile:</L>
<L>Tho' ev'ry one who knows this author, knows</L>
<L>He shifts his stile much oftner than his cloaths?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHENCE could arise this mighty critic spleen,</L>
<L>The Muse a trifler, and her theme so mean?</L>
<L>What had I done, that angry HEAVEN should send</L>
<L>The bitt'rest Foe, where most I wish'd a Friend?</L>
<L>Oft hath my tongue been wanton at thy name,</L>
<L>And hail'd the honours of thy matchless fame.</L>
<L>For me let hoary FIELDING bite the ground</L>
<L>So nobler PICKLE stand superbly bound.</L>
<L>From LIVY's temples tear th' historic crown</L>
<L>Which, with more justice blooms upon thine own.</L>
<L>Compar'd with thee, be all life-writers dumb,</L>
<L>But he who wrote the Life of TOMMY THUMB.</L>
<L>Who ever read the REGICIDE but swore</L>
<L>The author wrote as man ne'er wrote before?</L>
<L>Others for plots and under-plots may call,</L>
<L>Here's the right method—have no plot at all.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
Who can so often in his cause engage,</L>
<L>The tiny Pathos of the Grecian stage,</L>
<L>Whilst horrors rise, and tears spontaneous flow</L>
<L>At tragic Ha! and no less tragic Oh!?</L>
<L>His NERVOUS WEAKNESS all to praise agree;</L>
<L>And then, for sweetness, who so sweet as he?</L>
<L>Too big for utterance when sorrows swell</L>
<L>The too big sorrows flowing tears must tell:</L>
<L>But when those flowing tears shall cease to flow,</L>
<L>Why,—then the voice must speak again you know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>RUDE and unskilful in the Poet's trade,</L>
<L>I kept no Naiads by me ready-made;</L>
<L>Ne'er did I colours high in air advance,</L>
<L>Torn from the bleeding fopperies of France:</L>
<L>No flimsey linsey-woolsey scenes I wrote</L>
<L>With patches here and there like Joseph's coat.</L>
<L>Me humbler themes befit: Secure, for me,</L>
<L>Let Playwrights smuggle nonsense duty free:</L>
<L>Secure, for me, ye lambs, ye lambkins bound,</L>
<L>And frisk and frolic o'er the fairy ground:</L>
<L>Secure, for me, thou pretty little fawn</L>
<L>Lick SYLVIA's hand, and crop the flow'ry lawn:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
Uncensur'd let the gentle breezes rove,</L>
<L>Thro' the green umbrage of th' enchanted grove:</L>
<L>Secure, for me, let foppish Nature smile,</L>
<L>And play the coxcomb in the DESART ISLE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Stage I chose—a subject fair and free—</L>
<L>'Tis yours—'tis mine—'tis Public Property.</L>
<L>All Common Exhibitions open lye</L>
<L>For Praise or Censure to the Common Eye.</L>
<L>Hence are a thousand Hackney-writers fed;</L>
<L>Hence Monthly Critics earn their Daily Bread.</L>
<L>This is a gen'ral tax which all must pay,</L>
<L>From those who scribble, down to those who play.</L>
<L>Actors, a venal crew, receive support</L>
<L>From public bounty, for the public sport.</L>
<L>To clap or hiss, all have an equal claim,</L>
<L>The cobbler's and his lordship's right the same.</L>
<L>All join for their subsistence; all expect</L>
<L>Free leave to praise their worth, their faults correct.</L>
<L>When active PICKLE Smithfield stage ascends,</L>
<L>The three days wonder of his laughing friends;</L>
<L>Each, or as judgment, or as fancy guides,</L>
<L>The lively witling praises or derides.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
And where's the mighty diff'rence, tell me where,</L>
<L>Betwixt a Merry Andrew and a Play'r?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE strolling tribe, a despicable race,</L>
<L>Like wand'ring Arabs, shift from place to place.</L>
<L>Vagrants by law, to justice open laid,</L>
<L>They tremble, of the beadle's lash afraid,</L>
<L>And fawning cringe, for wretched means of life,</L>
<L>To Madam May'ress or his Worship's Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mighty monarch, in theatric sack,</L>
<L>Carries his whole regalia at his back;</L>
<L>His royal consort heads the female band,</L>
<L>And leads the heir-apparent in her hand;</L>
<L>The pannier'd ass creeps on with conscious pride,</L>
<L>Bearing a future prince on either side.</L>
<L>No choice musicians in this troop are found</L>
<L>To varnish nonsense with the charms of sound;</L>
<L>No swords, no daggers, not one poison'd bowl;</L>
<L>No lightning flashes here, no thunders roll;</L>
<L>No guards to swell the monarch's train are shewn;</L>
<L>The monarch here must be an host ALONE.</L>
<L>No solemn pomp, no slow processions here;</L>
<L>No Ammon's entry, and no Juliet's bier.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
<L>BY need compell'd to prostitute his art,</L>
<L>The varied actor flies from part to part;</L>
<L>And, strange disgrace to all theatric pride,</L>
<L>His character is shifted with his side.</L>
<L>Question and Answer he by turns must be,</L>
<L>Like that small wit in MODERN TRAGEDY;</L>
<L>Who, to support his fame,—or fill his purse,—</L>
<L>Still pilfers wretched plans, and makes them worse;</L>
<L>Like gypsies, least the stolen brat be known,</L>
<L>Defacing first, then claiming for his own.</L>
<L>In shabby state they strut, and tatter'd robe;</L>
<L>The scene a blanket, and a barn the globe.</L>
<L>No high conceits their mod'rate wishes raise,</L>
<L>Content with humble profit, humble praise.</L>
<L>Let dowdies simper, and let bumpkins stare,</L>
<L>The strolling pageant heroe treads in air:</L>
<L>Pleas'd for his hour he to mankind gives law,</L>
<L>And snores the next out on a truss of straw.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT if kind Fortune, who we sometimes know</L>
<L>Can take a heroe from a puppet-shew,</L>
<L>In mood propitious should her fav'rite call,</L>
<L>On royal stage in royal pomp to bawl,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Forgetful of himself he rears the head,</L>
<L>And scorns the dunghill where he first was bred:</L>
<L>Conversing now with well-dress'd kings and queens,</L>
<L>With gods and goddesses behind the scenes,</L>
<L>He sweats beneath the terror-nodding plume,</L>
<L>Taught by Mock Honours Real Pride t' assume.</L>
<L>On this great stage the World, no monarch e'er</L>
<L>Was half so haughty as a Monarch-Player.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DOTH it more move our anger or our mirth</L>
<L>To see these THINGS, the lowest sons of earth,</L>
<L>Presume, with self-sufficient knowledge grac'd,</L>
<L>To rule in Letters and preside in Taste.</L>
<L>The TOWN's decisions they no more admit,</L>
<L>Themselves alone the ARBITERS of Wit;</L>
<L>And scorn the jurisdiction of that COURT</L>
<L>To which they owe their being and support.</L>
<L>Actors, like monks of old, now sacred grown,</L>
<L>Must be attack'd by no fools but their own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LET the Vain Tyrant sit amidst his guards,</L>
<L>His puny GREEN-ROOM Wits and Venal Bards,</L>
<L>Who meanly tremble at the Puppet's frown,</L>
<L>And, for a Playhouse Freedom lose their own;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
In spite of new-made Laws, and new-made Kings,</L>
<L>The free-born Muse with lib'ral spirit sings,</L>
<L>Bow down, ye Slaves; before these Idols fall;</L>
<L>Let Genius stoop to them who've none all;</L>
<L>Ne'er will I flatter, cringe, or bend the knee</L>
<L>To those who, Slaves to ALL, are Slaves to ME.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ACTORS, as Actors, are a lawful game;</L>
<L>The poet's right; and Who shall bar his claim?</L>
<L>And, if o'er-weening of their little skill,</L>
<L>When they have left the Stage they're Actors still;</L>
<L>If to the subject world they still give laws,</L>
<L>With paper crowns, and sceptres made of straws;</L>
<L>If they in cellar or in garret roar,</L>
<L>And Kings one night, are Kings for evermore;</L>
<L>Shall not bold Truth, e'en there, pursue her theme,</L>
<L>And wake the Coxcomb from his golden dream?</L>
<L>Or if, well worthy of a better fate,</L>
<L>They rise superior to their present state;</L>
<L>If, with each social virtue grac'd, they blend</L>
<L>The gay companion and the faithful friend;</L>
<L>If they, like PRITCHARD, join in private life</L>
<L>The tender parent and the virtuous wife;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
Shall not our Verse their praise with pleasure speak,</L>
<L>Though Mimics bark and Envy split her cheek?</L>
<L>No honest worth's beneath the Muse's praise;</L>
<L>No greatness can above her censure raise:</L>
<L>Station and wealth, to Her, are trifling things;</L>
<L>She stoops to Actors, and she soars to Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IS there a man, in vice and folly bred,</L>
<L>To sense of honour as to virtue dead;</L>
<L>Whom ties nor human, nor divine, can bind;</L>
<L>Alien to GOD, and foe to all mankind;</L>
<L>Who spares no character; whose ev'ry word,</L>
<L>Bitter as gall, and sharper than the sword,</L>
<L>Cuts to the quick; whose thoughts with rancour swell:</L>
<L>Whose tongue, on earth, performs the work of Hell?</L>
<L>If there be such a monster, the REVIEWS</L>
<L>Shall find him holding forth against Abuse.</L>
<L>" Attack Profession!—'tis a deadly breach!—</L>
<L>" The Christian laws another lesson teach:—</L>
<L>" Unto the end should charity endure,</L>
<L>" And Candour hide those faults it cannot cure."</L>
<L>Thus Candour's maxims flow from Rancour's throat,</L>
<L>As devils, to serve their purpose, Scripture quote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
<L>THE Muse's office was by HEAVEN design'd,</L>
<L>To please, improve, instruct, reform mankind;</L>
<L>To make dejected Virtue nobly rise</L>
<L>Above the tow'ring pitch of splendid Vice;</L>
<L>To make pale Vice, abash'd, her head hang down,</L>
<L>And trembling crouch at Virtue's awful frown.</L>
<L>Now arm'd with wrath, she bids eternal shame;</L>
<L>With strictest justice brands the villain's name:</L>
<L>Now in the milder garb of Ridicule</L>
<L>She sports, and pleases while she wounds the Fool.</L>
<L>Her shape is often varied; but her aim,</L>
<L>To prop the cause of Virtue, still the same.</L>
<L>In praise of Mercy let the guilty bawl,</L>
<L>When Vice and Folly for Correction call;</L>
<L>Silence the mark of weakness justly bears,</L>
<L>And is partaker of the crimes it spares.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT if the Muse, too cruel in her mirth,</L>
<L>With harsh reflexions wound the man of worth;</L>
<L>If wantonly she deviate from her plan,</L>
<L>And quits the Actor to expose the Man;</L>
<L>Asham'd, she marks that passage with a blot,</L>
<L>And hates the line where Candour was forgot.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
<L>BUT what is Candour, what is Humour's vein,</L>
<L>Tho' Judgment join to consecrate the strain,</L>
<L>If curious numbers will not aid afford,</L>
<L>Nor choicest music play in ev'ry word?</L>
<L>Verses must run, to charm a modern ear,</L>
<L>From all harsh, rugged interruptions clear:</L>
<L>Soft let them breathe, as Zephyr's balmy breeze;</L>
<L>Smooth let their current flow as summer seas;</L>
<L>Perfect then only deem'd when they dispense</L>
<L>A happy tuneful vacancy of sense.</L>
<L>Italian fathers thus, with barb'rous rage,</L>
<L>Fit helpless infants for the squeaking stage;</L>
<L>Deaf to the calls of pity, Nature wound,</L>
<L>And mangle vigour for the sake of sound.</L>
<L>Henceforth farewell then, fev'rish thirst of fame;</L>
<L>Farewell the longings for a Poet's name;</L>
<L>Perish my Muse;—a wish 'bove all severe</L>
<L>To him who ever held the Muses dear,</L>
<L>If e'er her labours weaken to refine</L>
<L>Th' gen'rous roughness of a nervous line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OTHERS affect the stiff and swelling phrase;</L>
<L>Their Muse must walk in stilts and strut in stays:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20"/>
The sense they murder, and the words transpose,</L>
<L>Lest Poetry approach too near to Prose.</L>
<L>See, tortur'd Reason how they pare and trim,</L>
<L>And, like Procrustes, stretch or lop the limb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WALLER, whose praise succeeding bards rehearse,</L>
<L>Parent of harmony in English verse,</L>
<L>Whose tuneful Muse in sweetest accent flows,</L>
<L>In couplets first taught straggling sense to close.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN polish'd numbers, and majestic sound,</L>
<L>Where shall thy rival, POPE, be ever found?</L>
<L>But whilst each line with equal beauty flows,</L>
<L>E'en excellence, unvary'd, tedious grows.</L>
<L>Nature, thro' all her works, in great degree,</L>
<L>Borrows a blessing from VARIETY.</L>
<L>Music itself her needful aid requires</L>
<L>To rouze the soul, and wake our dying fires.</L>
<L>Still in one key, the Nightingale would teize:</L>
<L>Still in one key, not BRENT would always please.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE let me bend, great DRYDEN, at thy shrine,</L>
<L>Thou dearest name to all the tuneful nine.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
What if some dull lines in cold order creep,</L>
<L>And with his theme the poet seems to sleep?</L>
<L>Still when his subject rises proud to view,</L>
<L>With equal strength the poet rises too.</L>
<L>With strong invention, noblest vigour fraught,</L>
<L>Thought still springs up and rises out of thought;</L>
<L>Numbers, ennobling numbers in their course,</L>
<L>In varied sweetness flow, in varied force;</L>
<L>The pow'rs of Genius and of Judgment join,</L>
<L>And the Whole Art of Poetry is Thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT what are Numbers, what are Bards to me,</L>
<L>Forbid to tread the paths of Poesy?</L>
<L>" A sacred muse should consecrate her Pen;</L>
<L>" Priests must not hear nor see like other Men;</L>
<L>" Far higher themes should her ambition claim;</L>
<L>" Behold where STERNHOLD points the way to Fame."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILST, with mistaken zeal, dull bigots burn,</L>
<L>Let REASON for a moment take her turn.</L>
<L>When Coffee-sages hold discourse with kings,</L>
<L>And blindly walk in Paper Leading-strings,</L>
<L>What if a man delight to pass his time</L>
<L>In spinning Reason into harmless Rhime;</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Or sometimes boldly venture to the Play?</L>
<L>Say, Where's the Crime?—Great Man of Prudence, say?</L>
<L>No two on earth in one thing can agree,</L>
<L>All have some darling singularity.</L>
<L>Women and men, as well as girls and boys,</L>
<L>In Gew-gaws take delight, and sigh for toys.</L>
<L>Your sceptres, and your crowns, and such like things,</L>
<L>Are but a better kind of toys for kings.</L>
<L>In things indiff'rent, REASON bids us chuse,</L>
<L>Whether the Whim's a MONKEY or a MUSE.</L>

<LG>
<L>WHAT the grave triflers on this busy scene,</L>
<L>When they make use of this word REASON, mean,</L>
<L>I know not; but, according to my plan,</L>
<L>'TIS LORD-CHEIF-JUSTICE in the COURT OF MAN,</L>
<L>Equally form'd to rule in age and youth,</L>
<L>The Friend of Virtue and the Guide to Truth.</L>
<L>To HER I bow, whose sacred power I feel;</L>
<L>To HER decision make my last appeal;</L>
<L>Condemn'd by HER, applauding worlds, in vain,</L>
<L>Should tempt me to resume the Pen again:</L>
<L>By HER absolv'd, my course I'll still pursue:</L>
<L>If REASON's for me, GOD is for me too.</L>
