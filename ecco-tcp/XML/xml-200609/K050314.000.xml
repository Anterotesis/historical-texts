<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF
Count TARIFF, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>COUNT <HI>Tariff,</HI> whose History we
are now to write, is a Person
who has been so much misrepre∣sented
among us, and painted
in such monstrous Shapes, that 'tis but
a piece of Justice to a Stranger to rescue
his Character from the Mob, and to
search what may be found in ancient
History concerning him.</P>
<P>So far as we have search'd into Anti∣quity,
we find him lineally descended
from the ancient Line of the <HI>Tariffs,</HI> a
Family of such Quality as well as Anti∣quity
in <HI>France,</HI> that they trace their Ge∣nealogy
as high as any History can be
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
found; and they appear equal in Birth
to <HI>Commerce</HI> it self, whose Antiquity no
Body doubts of.</P>
<P>The present Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> the chief of
his Family, is a Person, who, as well
for his proper Merit as his high Birth as
aforesaid, has been esteemed and respected
all over <HI>Europe;</HI> and for the great Inte∣rest
he has in his Country, has been
sought unto by most of the Nations in
<HI>Europe,</HI> upon many occasions.</P>
<P>He always appear'd to be a Patron of
Trade, as what he esteem'd was exceed∣ingly
conducive to the general Good of
Mankind: As this was his especial Aim,
so he did not so much apply himself to
this or that particular Branch or part of
Trade, but endeavour'd upon all occa∣sions
to shew himself a Friend to univer∣sal
Commerce; as it respected the Im∣provement
and general Advantage of
the World, and from this Rule he con∣stantly
employ'd the Influence he had
on Affairs, <HI>which was not small</HI> to the Re∣gulation
and good Government of Trade
in his own Country.</P>
<P>He took on him the general Manage∣ment
of Commerce on the 18th of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI>
1664. which being the first time
of his publick Appearance in the World,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
we shall not enquire into any part of his
Conduct before that time.</P>
<P>He had no sooner settled and made pub∣lick
<HI>his Rules</HI> of Commerce; but all the
Trading part of the World were made
sensible of the Advantage they receiv'd
thereby, and consequently began to en∣tertain
a true and very great Opinion
of his Worth, and very quickly courted
his Friendship: This Nation especially
made great Advantage of his Corre∣spondence,
for he was a particular Friend
to the <HI>English Trade,</HI> and encourag'd it
upon all Occasions: It is true, he acted
upon open Measures of Correspondence,
and was a Friend to universal Trade, <HI>as
above:</HI> He abhorr'd Prohibitions, Restric∣tions
and Exclusion of Nations in Trade;
but if he had any Peculiar, if he treated
any one Nation with Distinction more
than another, it was <HI>England;</HI> which was
all the Reason that has yet been assign'd,
why some People in the Kingdom have
treated him with such Rudeness and
Disrespect ever since: But however, they
have used him, it is most certain <HI>England</HI>
felt the sensible Advantage of his Acquain∣tance,
and corresponded with him to
their great Profit, as well as Satisfaction
for several Years, receiving every Year
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
great Sums of Money from him, and by
his means.</P>
<P>He was particularly a very great Friend
to the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture: He always
appear'd at Court in a Suit of <HI>English
Broad Cloth,</HI> and cloth'd all his Servants in
the same; and tho' his Liveries were plain,
they were handsomer and richer than any
in that Country.</P>
<P>It happen'd however, after some time,
Divisions prevailing there as well as in
other Courts, that he began to be in
less Repute with some People than be∣fore,
yet he still went on as well as Cir∣cumstances
would admit, in his own
way, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of encouraging Trade; he
receiv'd all the Equipages of his Servants
and Furniture of his Houses from <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
Notwithstanding the fine Brocades
and rich Silks which are made in <HI>France,</HI>
he cloathed his Countess, and the young
Ladies his Daughters, and their Atten∣dants
in rich <HI>East-India</HI> Silks, fine Mus∣lins,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> bought in <HI>England,</HI> and brought
from the <HI>Indies</HI> by the <HI>English East-India</HI>
Company.</P>
<P>Upon building his fine Country-Seat
of TARIFF-CASTLE, in <HI>France,</HI>
all the fine Locks and Keys, and several
other parts of the Furniture came from
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>England;</HI> the Roof was cover'd with Lead
to distinguish his Respect for the <HI>English</HI>
Commerce, and all the Vessels and Uten∣sils
of his Family, which it was proper to
have so, were of <HI>English</HI> Pewter.</P>
<P>This particular Conduct of the Count,
with respect to the <HI>English</HI> Trade, gave
some Umbrage in <HI>France;</HI> and whether
it were by the Artifice of some of his
Neighbours, who always envy'd and
rivall'd the <HI>English;</HI> or whether it was
meerly the Inclination of the People there
to set up Manufactures of their own, Au∣thors
are not agreed about it; but it pro∣cured
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> many Enemies at home,
as is before observ'd; nay, even his own
Tenants and Neighbours complain'd that
he favour'd Foreigners and foreign Ma∣nufactures,
alledging that his Coaches
were lined with <HI>English</HI> CLOTH, his
Rooms hang'd with <HI>English</HI> STUFFS,
that all his Servants smoaked TOBACCO,
and other Circumstances falling in with
this at the same time, the <HI>Count</HI> was
oblig'd to alter his Measures, and first
declined some part of the <HI>English</HI> Trade
by several publick Acts, as particularly
on the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 1665. the 20th
of <HI>December,</HI> 1687. and at last he was
obliged wholly to renounce it on the 7th
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
of <HI>September,</HI> 1701. Upon these Distur∣bances
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> being necessitated, as
abovesaid, to lay aside all Correspon∣dence
with his <HI>English</HI> Friends; they, on
the other hand, acted the weakest part
that ever was known among Trading Men
and Merchants; for however he had
been their Friend, and however absur'd,
it was on their side to forbid the Expor∣tation
of their own Manufactures; yet
they took that simple Step, and without
respect to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> or the Injury
they did to their own Workmen in the
Countries, and their Families, truly,
they cut off their own Trade, and would
not suffer any more Broad-Cloth, or Ser∣ges,
Stuffs, Bays, Kersies, Dozens, or
any Woollen Manufactures, or other
Goods, to be sent to Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> by
which piece of Wisdom they lost their
Country, the Exportation of above Six
hundred thousand Pounds a Year, in Goods
of their own Growth or Manufactures;
besides those of the Growth and Pro∣duce
of their Plantations and other Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> being treated thus by his
<HI>English</HI> Friends, it was not to be wondred
if Mynheer <HI>Coopmanschap,</HI> an old Car∣rier,
and a cunning, tricking, circum∣venting,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
sharping <HI>Dutch</HI> Broker, fell in
with him: This <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> was a great
Dealer in the Manufactures and Produce
of other Countries, but had very few or
none at all of his own: He drove indeed
a great Trade to most parts of the World:
It was he who made that famous Voy∣age
to <HI>Japan,</HI> where when he was asked
by the Emperour, whether he was a
<HI>Christian</HI> or not, he answer'd, he was a
a HOLLANDER: He had been all
over the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and particularly was
Governour at <HI>Amboyna</HI> upon a certain
Butcherly occasion, which <HI>Authors say</HI> is
nothing to the purpose now, because it
was a great while ago: He has driven
a great Trade ever since by Interloping
into the Trade of other Nations, but is
especially remarkable for keeping his Word
no longer than he finds it for his Gain,
and then complaining that others DO
SO: It was not many Years before this,
that he was in Partnership with a great
<HI>German</HI> Merchant, one Mynheer <HI>Leopol∣dus</HI>
of <HI>Vienna;</HI> in which they had agreed
not to lay down their Trade but by mu∣tual
Consent, and particularly old <HI>Coop∣manschap</HI>
bound himself, not to contract
any Partnership without the Consent of
<HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and without taking him in;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
but he broke his Word, and left old <HI>Leo∣poldus</HI>
in the Lurch before the Voyage
was half finish'd; which is mention'd
for their Service, who pretend to say he
was injured lately <HI>that may</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was not ignorant of the
Subtilty and Knavery of this Tricking
<HI>Dutchman,</HI> for he had heard his Character,
and had dealt with him before; but his
Circumstances requiring him to settle a
Correspondence <HI>some where,</HI> and having
been ill used where he inclined to settle,
he found it for his Advantage to engage
with <HI>Mynheer;</HI> and accordingly Articles
of Partnership were sign'd between them
on the 7th of <HI>December,</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>It was no small Surprize to the rest of
the Trading Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> that Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> had settled with <HI>Mynheer;</HI> and tho'
it had been better for them all, that he
had continu'd to Trade with the whole
World on equal Terms, as before; yet
when they found that could not be,
they would all have been glad to have
had him exclusively to themselves; but
old <HI>Coopmanschap,</HI> according to Custom,
was too cunning for them all, and
knowing the Worth of the <HI>Count,</HI> he
supplanted all the World, and got him to
himself.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
One of the principal Businesses of <HI>Myn∣heer,</HI>
after he had secur'd Count <HI>Tariff</HI> to
himself, was to prevent his Trading with
any Body else; and fain he would have
had the Count have entered into some ex∣clusive
Terms with him, which at first
he could not obtain, it being not inclu∣ded
in their Articles; but it fell in af∣terwards
upon the occasion of some of
his old Correspondents prohibiting their
Factors to send him any Woollen Manu∣factures,
<HI>as aforesaid.</HI></P>
<P>No sooner had old <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> and
the Count engaged, but the <HI>Dutchman</HI>
began to insult all Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s old
Correspondents, and put the Dice upon
all that Traded with him before; for
no Body could Trade with Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
at all NOW, but they must pay
TOLL to old <HI>Coopmanschap,</HI> no Goods
could be sent to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> but in old
<HI>Coopmanschap</HI>'s Waggons and Ships, so that
he became the general <HI>Carryer</HI> to all the
Trade of that side of the World, and
got something by every thing that <HI>other
People</HI> dealt in.</P>
<P>This made him so Insolent, that if
any Proposals of Peace or Trade were
made to him, his Answer was always,
Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> Count <HI>Tariff, ick vil hab
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Count Tariff,</HI> nothing must be done with∣out
Count <HI>Tariff.</HI></P>
<P>At last <HI>Mynheer</HI> thinking he had effec∣tually
secured all the Trade of the World,
and that he was able to keep every Body
else out of it; truly he began to use
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> himself very scurvily, and
on several Occasions abused him very
grosly; insomuch that <HI>the Count</HI> who ea∣sily
saw himself maltreated, grew weary
of him: He found that this <HI>Coopmanschap</HI>
was but a Jobber of other Peoples Trade,
a meer <HI>Pedlar,</HI> a <HI>Waggoner,</HI> or <HI>Carrier</HI> for
other Merchants; that all the Goods he
(Count <HI>Tariff</HI>) bought of him, were
brought to him at <HI>Second Hand,</HI> and that
he might much better have them direct∣ly
from the Makers and Manufacturers,
and the Countries where they were pro∣duced:
Wherefore he (Count <HI>Tariff.</HI>)
resolved at last, to put an end to it; and
accordingly, he wrote him a very plain
Letter, telling him what a cozening old
Knave he had been, how rich he was
grown by means of the Partnership, and
yet how basely he had treated his Part∣ner▪
and in short told him in so many
Words at the end of his Letter, that
he would have no more to do with
him.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
It is not to be wondred if <HI>Mynheer</HI>
was Thunder-struck at this surprizing
Letter; for by it, on a sudden, he lost
all those Advantages which had for some
time raised up both his Purse and his
Pride; and which had enabled him to
hold up his Head, and think himself e∣qual
with the richest Merchant in <HI>Eu∣rope.</HI>
But from this Disappointment he
began to alter his Tone, and talk a lit∣tle
humbler than he was wont to do;
mean time he omitted nothing to recover
his former Interest in Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and
if possible, to retrieve the Partnership;
and to that purpose, he dispatched two
of his Factors to go to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s
House, and to try if they could by any
Offers, Submissions, and Promises, and on
any Conditions whatsoever, retrieve this
Blow; that he might preserve his govern∣ing
Influence on the Trade of <HI>Europe:</HI>
But after several vain Attempts of this na∣ture,
<HI>he found</HI> that it was impracticable,
and that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was resolved, <HI>for
his sake,</HI> that he would never more engage
in a separate Partnership; but that he
had reassumed his former generous Prin∣ciple,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>encouraging universal Com∣merce,</HI>
a thing that did not suit with
Mynheer's Designs at all; who always
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
advanced himself by encroaching on
other Mens Trade, rather than by car∣rying
on any particular Trade of his own;
as is evident by his Trade to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
which he rifled a great <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Merchant of; his <HI>Herring Fishery,</HI> which
he got by Encroachment on the Scots
Merchants, and by his Trade to the <HI>Bra∣zils</HI>
and <HI>Surinam,</HI> which he stole from the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>But Mynheer, who never used to give
a Game over while he had any Cards
left in his hand to play, when he found
he could not get Count <HI>Tariff</HI> to him∣self;
his next Concern was to take care
that the Count should not engage with
any body else; and particularly, he was
sensible it would be a very great Loss
to him if any English Merchants should
embark with him: It seems he had had
some private Intimation, that Count <HI>Ta∣riff</HI>
was about making a new Partner∣ship
with one Mr. <HI>Traffick,</HI> an eminent
Merchant and Alderman of <HI>London.</HI>
This Mr. <HI>Traffick</HI> traded, it seems, in
Company with one <HI>Harry Woolpack,</HI> a fa∣mous
Clothier in the West; and toge∣ther,
they two manag'd the whole Trade
of the Woollen Manufacturers on that
side of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
It was a mortal Blow to Mynheer,
to think that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> should en∣gage
with these People, and it put him
into a cold Sweat immediately; for these
were the very Men that he had bubbled
for so many Years past; for having kept
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> under his Thumb, he got
all the Trade into his own Hand, made
those English Merchants glad to sell their
Woollen Manufactures to him, some <HI>fi∣nish'd,</HI>
some <HI>unfinish'd,</HI> as he pleased to
take them, and at <HI>what Price</HI> he pleased
to give for them; so that they only fur∣nish'd
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> at second-hand, and
old <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> got the Profit.</P>
<P>All the while he did thus he wheed∣led
Mr. Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Harry
Woolpack</HI> with fine Stories of his being
their only Friend; of his taking off such
vast Quantities of their Manufactures
more than other Nations; nay sometimes
he would say more than all the Nations
of the World; and, that no body could
do this but he; <HI>whereas the Truth was,</HI>
that all this while he was only the <HI>Mid∣dleman,</HI>
or Broker, between both; for
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was really the Man who
procured most of the Trade, and made
the great Consumption of the Woollen
Manufactures by encouraging the wear∣ing
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
thereof, as aforesaid, among his Te∣nants
and Servants: and this subtle Dutch∣man
had only been a Pick-pocket on
both Sides. As soon as Mr. <HI>Traffick</HI> and
<HI>Harry Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lpack,</HI> and their other Partners,
came to understand this, it gave them a
most contemptible Opinion of old <HI>Coop∣man
schap,</HI> and made them reflect with
great Regret on those Councils which
had led them into such a Noose, and cau∣sed
them to be so dup'd, and made Fools
of, by this old Dutch Man for so many
Years, to the Ruin of their Trade, and
the enriching of him and his Hangers
on: When their Eyes were thus open∣ed,
and they saw clearly how they had
been play'd upon and cozen'd, they enter∣tained
with great Readiness the Proposals
of <HI>a new Partnership</HI> with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI>
which the Count, by his Agents, had of∣fered
them about that time.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Treaty of Partnership
between Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and the Count,
having gone on with great Sincerity and
Application on both sides, it was conclu∣ded
and signed between Arbitrators em∣ployed
by both Parties on the 31st of
<HI>March</HI> 1712. tho' this was not brought
to pass without a mighty Opposition of old
<HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opmanschap</HI> and his Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
It was thought at first, that the Treaty
having been thus finished, and all Par∣ties
being thus agreed, there could not
have been any room for a Miscarriage
after that; and it was not doubted but
Messieurs <HI>Traffick and Company</HI> would have
driven a gallant Trade the next Year
with Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> but it proved quite
otherwise, by the Subtilty and indefati∣gable
Cunning and Diligence of that old
Fox <HI>Coopmanschap;</HI> the Particulars of whose
Intrigues make the next part of our
Story.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> having been alarmed,
as is said already, by the Report of a
Treaty being set on foot between Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> on one hand, and the said Mr. Al∣derman
<HI>Traffick</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and his Part∣ners
in the Country, <HI>on the other hand;</HI>
he found there was no time to be lost;
for these, as aforesaid, were the greatest
Dealers in the <HI>British</HI> Woollen Manu∣factures
that were in the World; and
the very same Men who he had bought
all the Woollen Goods of, which he had
supplied Count <HI>Tariff</HI> with, during their
late Partnership; he knew also if the
Count sell in with them, he should not
only be circumvented and become useless
in the Trade, but that all his Cunning
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and Knavery would be exposed on either
Hand; That first Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would see
how he had made him pay thro' the Nose
for every thing which he had bought,
and that he could buy cheaper of Alder∣man
<HI>Traffick</HI> and Company; and not on∣ly
so, but the Alderman and his Partners
would discover also, how when he had
beaten down the Price, and brought them
to sell their Goods so monstrous cheap,
that their poor Workmen could hardly
get Bread by their Labour, he sold those
Goods at the same time for a great Price to
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> and so he had gotten the
Profit of all the Trade to himself.</P>
<P>He was conscious that when both Sides
came thus to see into his Knavery, they
would equally resent his former Corre∣spondence
with them, and never have
any thing to do with him in that respect
again; that by this means he should lose his
Cullies, and be quite stript of the Ad∣vantage
he had always made by them.</P>
<P>Upon this and many other Mischiefs
which he foresaw would follow, he re∣solved
to go over for <HI>England,</HI> and by
all means possible, endeavour to prevent
the Partners making their new Treaty
of Partnership EFFECTUAL.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
He was encouraged to make this At∣tempt
by a secret Correspondence, which
he always held in that Country with a
certain CLUB or Society of Men, who
having certain private wicked Projects of
their own to carry on by his Assistance,
were declared Enemies to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
for his sake; and by consequence would
be sure, right or wrong, to oppose the
new Partnership Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was making
with their Fellow-Citizens, however it
might be to the prejudice of their Coun∣try
or of themselves; Envy and Revenge
being the most Self-denying Vices in the
World. These People pretended indeed
to be very great Friends to Alderman
<HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Henry Woollpack</HI> his Partner,
yet they had given several sufficient Te∣stimonies
of their being willing to Sacri∣fice
them both for the Interest of old
<HI>Coopmanschap;</HI> and even to sell them and
their Country too into Slavery to him,
to work in his <HI>Rasp-house</HI> in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
rather than not oblige him to be their
Friend in those other Projects which they
were carrying on, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Having such an Interest there, he
made the best of his way for <HI>England,</HI>
and had the good Luck to come there
before the Articles of Copartnership, which
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
the Arbitrators on both Sides had made
between Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and his new Part∣ners,
were arrived.</P>
<P>As soon as he was come to <HI>London,</HI>
he gave notice to his trusty Friend Sir
<HI>Politick Falshood,</HI> who was generally Chair∣man
of that Society, that he Purposed
to be at the Club the next Day, who ac∣cordingly
intimated the same to the whole
Party, in order to have a full Assembly.</P>
<P>Being come to the Club, and having
saluted the Members, he stood up and
made a Speech to them to the following
Purpose.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Here follows an Account of the Speech which
Mynheer VAN COOPMANSCHAP made
at his first Appearance in the Club.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, He gave them thanks for the
great Services they had done him
upon all Occasions in time past, and the
great Obligations which they had laid
upon him; <HI>for That,</HI> not regarding their
Country, their Liberty, their present
Advantages, or their Posterity, they had,
with a steady and unshaken Zeal, al∣ways
preferred his <HI>Interest</HI> to THEIR
OWN.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
He acknowledged, that in a former
Partnership, wherein they had been en∣gaged
with him, they never insisted up∣on
his paying in the Proportions of
STOCK agreed upon between them;
But had very kindly carried on <HI>their own
Part,</HI> and most of <HI>his too,</HI> tho' at the
same time they were fain to run them∣selves
into heavy Debts, <HI>more than ever
they were like to have paid,</HI> besides several
other Inconveniencies to <HI>do</HI> it; and also
altho' the <HI>greatest part</HI> of the Profit of
the Partnership fell to HIS SHARE; all
which, he told them, added to the Ge∣nerosity
of their Treatment of him, and
which therefore obliged him to this
grateful Remembrance thereof.</P>
<P>He owned, and <HI>therewith he made them
a Grimace,</HI> that they had been very
Friendly to him, in not examining his
Accounts relating to the said Partner∣ship,
but had passed them upon <HI>his Credit,</HI>
which he (being utterly unable to make
a fair Account) was very much obliged
to them for.</P>
<P>He could not forget, <HI>he said,</HI> how
frankly they had furnished the greatest
part of the Ships employed in their Part∣nership,
even without charging him for
his share of the Freight, whereby he
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
had been at leisure to carry on the
<HI>North-Seas-Trade,</HI> which was quite out
of the Partnership, at their Expence; and
which had encouraged him to charge
even those Ships also which were em∣ployed
in the said separate Trade to the
<HI>North-Seas,</HI> as if employed in the said
Partnership, to his unspeakable Advan∣tage;
for which he said he was infi∣nitely
obliged to them.</P>
<P>That whereas they had been equally
concerned for several Years past, in car∣rying
on an Undertaking for the French
PHILOSOPHERS STONE, which
as it had been both hazardous and ex∣pensive,
so it had been owned to be,
<HI>as such Projects generally are,</HI> very unlike∣ly
to succeed, especially to the height that
some proposed; he told them he thought
himself obliged to confess, that they
had generously supplied more Workmen
for the said Undertaking than they were
bound to furnish by their Agreement,
and yet had not made him pay toward
the extraordinary Charge of it. It is
true▪ <HI>said</HI> he, you once proposed to me,
that in Consideration thereof, I should
break my Partnership with Count <HI>Ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3+ letters" DISP="•••…"/>,</HI>
and have no more to do with him;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, upon my representing to
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
you faithfully how much it would be
to my Prejudice tho' to your Advan∣tage,
you were so kind as not to insist
upon it; which I acknowledge, <HI>said he,
and made them a Dutch Bow,</HI> was a great
Instance of <HI>Self-denial</HI> in you, and disin∣terested
Friendship to me.</P>
<P>But <HI>he told them</HI> he had yet greater
things than those to thank them for,
and particularly, that <HI>bold Step</HI> they took
on his Account, and which few Partners
but they would have ventur'd at, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That when several of his principal Corre∣spondents
in <HI>England</HI> were in danger of
being turned out of their Shops and
Employments by their LANDLADY,
the Club had appeared so much interest∣ed
in their Behalf, as to depute some of
their RUDEST Members to Her, to
tell her <HI>very respectfully,</HI> that she ought
not to do so; that she ought to have
consulted them in the Management of
her Servants and Family; that if she
ventur'd to do it, she would entirely
lose their Favour, and did not stick to
threaten her, <HI>tho' she was their own Land∣lady</HI>
too, that in such case they would
shew their Resentment, and would nei∣ther
give her or her Tenants, or her
Workmen, Credit for one Farthing of
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
Mony, nor suffer any body else to do
it, nay nor pay her their Rent neither,
if they could help it; which Threatning,
tho' it did not succeed according to Ex∣pectation,
yet was such an extraordina∣ry
Step in his Favour, as he could not
but think himself very much obliged to
them for it.</P>
<P>He told them farther, that he was
particularly obliged to thank them for
another Instance of their Zeal for his
Interest, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that when some British
Merchants came over to a Place called
<HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> a City in his Country, in order
to recover a certain Branch of Trade
out of his Hands which he had circum∣vented
them of before, the Society had
endeavoured to expose and ruin those
Merchants, loudly declaring in all their
Societies, as well <HI>Grecian</HI> as <HI>English,</HI> that
it was neither just nor honest to take
any thing away from Mynheer <HI>Van
Coopmanschap,</HI> or to get any thing for
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> and Company, with∣out
letting him have an equal Share
of it, <HI>or, in short,</HI> to disoblige him in any
respect whatsoever: So that they justi∣fied
him highly in the Practice of what
every one knew was his Principle, <HI>viz.</HI>
That what every one else got should
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
be part of it his, and what he himself
got should be all his own.</P>
<P><HI>He thank'd them,</HI> he said, that in their
late famous Voyage or Adventure to
<HI>Terra</HI> (Gertrudenburg) <HI>Incognita,</HI> in
which they had been also Partners, yet
the Club had generously left the Ma∣nagement
of the whole Voyage to him,
owning themselves not fit to be trusted
in Affairs (tho' their own) of so nice
a nature; by which, had not his un∣happy
native Avarice prompted him to
grasp the Shadow and let slip the Sub∣stance,
he might have made a very good
Voyage for himself, at the Expence of
all the rest of his Partners; but as he
had no body to blame for the Miscar∣riage
but himself, so he thank'd them
for their Good-will, whatever Loss he
sustain'd by the Voyage.</P>
<P>It was true, he said, that another
Miscarriage of his had been the Effect
of their Advice to him, (<HI>viz.</HI>) when
they perswaded him to adhere to the
Executors of old <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and preferr
his German-Partnership to all other En∣gagements;
which piece of Council
overthrew the whole Voyage; for as <HI>on
the one hand</HI> he slip'd a good Opportu∣nity,
and refused an advantageous Of∣fer
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
of another Partnership, which he
inclined to embark in; and which, had
he closed with it, would have preven∣ted
the dismal Events that followed:
So, <HI>on the other hand,</HI> he not only was
disappointed in all his chimerical Hopes
of that Voyage, but had all his Vessels
plundered, his Goods and Merchandizes
taken away, and most of his Agents
and Servants were knock'd on the Head,
and thrown over-board, or carried into
Slavery; which forced him, at last,
shamefully to quit the said <HI>German Part∣nership,</HI>
and to lose all those Advantages
that had been offered him at first, as
aforesaid; however, he said, as he be∣lieved
the Society did it for the best,
and had only acted by him as they did
for themselves, and according to their
kown Politicks, (viz.) <HI>Never to know
when they are well,</HI> so he could not blame
them in the least.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, that their general
Conduct had been always with an Eye
to his Interest and Grandeur, which
they had given him so many Testimo∣nies
of that it was very much to his
Satisfiction, and which he had so far
depended upon, as had made him talk
in a different Tone from what he used
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
to do, to several of his other Partners;
for that he knew they were always rea∣dy
to back him in and approve of all
the Measures he took for advancing his
own Trade: and that they were always,
willing to sink their own Stocks, and
throw away their own Estates, rather
than he should be a Sufferer.</P>
<P>He told them also, that he thankfully
remembred how they had given him
timely notice, when they designed to
ruin the Publick Credit, if it had been
in their Power, that he might have suf∣ficient
time to draw out his Mony;
whereas had their Design succeeded, he
might, without such notice, have been
a very great Loser.</P>
<P>It was true, <HI>he said,</HI> he had observed
that altho' they had informed him that
their <HI>Landlady</HI> was a Bankrupt, and her
Credit broke, and perswaded him not
to lend her Mony; yet, as soon as she
had offered them a small Advantage in
the Loan, they all run in privately, and
lent their own Mony, leaving him out:
But as this was nothing but what he
taught them, and as he would have
done by them if it had been in his
Power, he was not at all disobliged by
it, knowing they would make him amends
for it many other ways.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
He told them, he was in a particu∣lar
manner obliged to them in other
Affairs of their Partnership, especially
for drawing up proper Memorials for
him upon certain Occasions, in which
they were so zealou, for his Interest,
and so willing to make him popular,
that they had frequently ventur'd to
Print them before they had been deli∣vered;
and if at any time his secret
Management had been discovered, and
the People began to entertain a mean
Opinion of his Honesty, they always
had employed their whole Set of Pam∣phleteers
to vindicate him, who had
covered the foulest of his Actions with
the most popular Lyes they could in∣vent;
of which they were very fruit∣ful,
and by an infinite number of Abu∣ses,
Invectives, and Libels, even against
<HI>their Landlady herself,</HI> and all her Fami∣ly,
and Servants, they had diverted the
Rage of the People, and impos'd upon
them in such a manner, that his Cha∣racter,
which was much in Danger by
some Mistakes he had fallen into, stood
very right again with the People; and
as he had maintained a kind of Corre∣spondence,
<HI>from the Teeth outward only,</HI>
with their <HI>Landlady,</HI> which however he
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
was alwas ready to break off when their
Interest should require it, he had there∣by
he hop'd kept himself in a Condition
to requite the Favours he had received
from them.</P>
<P>That for his part, he said, tho' he
should not boast of his Merit, yet he
hoped he had not been wanting on all
Occasions to shew his respect to them,
and to lay all the Obligations upon
them which it was in his Power to do.
That upon all Occasions he had supported
them in their private Designs and Con∣trivances
against their <HI>Landlady</HI> and her
Adherents, Family, and Servants; that
he had acquiesced in all the Memorials
they had drawn up for him, and been
as well satisfied with them when they
were drawn up at the farther End of
<HI>Piccadilly,</HI> as when they were done at
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which also had saved him a
great deal of Trouble; and tho' in one of
those Memorials they had committed a
fatal Mistake, in acknowledging the Fact
which it was intended to deny, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
about his having not supplyed the Quota
of Ships to the Partnership which he
had agreed to furnish, yet he was very
well satisfied with the Invention they
found out to cover it, whether it were
Truth of Fact or no.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="29"/>
He modestly put them in mind of
his great Concern for them in another
Affair, wherein he had made himself
Arbitrator for the Succession of their
Trade in the next Age; and preserving
a Partnership, which it was agreed
should be entered into, after a certain
Engagement was expired, with some
Merchants of <HI>Brunswick;</HI> which tho' they
all knew there was not the least need
of, that it was in it self nothing at
all, that Contract being effectually
secured by the Circumstances and na∣ture
of the thing; yet as it was of use
to them otherways, and served to make
the Reputation of the Club swell among
some People, so he had done it to serve
them; at the same time taking such effec∣tual
Care to preserve their Trade in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI>
by securing it all into his own
Hands, that he hoped it was to their
exceeding great Satisfaction: He put
them in mind how for their sakes he
had continued his Partnership with the
Executors of old <HI>Leopolaus</HI> Merchant of
<HI>Vienna,</HI> altho' Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had made
him very great Offers to break the
same; and altho' he had met with very
great Losses in carrying it on, and altho'
one Merchant <HI>Eugene,</HI> who was Factor
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
for the said Partnership, had imposed up∣on
him, and outstood his Market, having
been outwitted by Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Fac∣tors,
and so had spoiled the whole Voy∣age,
as he had just now told them.</P>
<P>He assured them in the next place, that
as he had served them with all his <HI>usual</HI>
Sincerity in these and many other occasi∣ons;
so he was still ready to assist and stand
by them in their private Concerns, and
to renew the Partnership they had carried
on so long, and which they had so suc∣cessfully
been engaged in, for as many
Years as they should think fit; that es∣pecially
he was ready to support them
and assist them in any Measures which
they should think proper against their
Landlady, whether to expose, ridicule,
and affront her Person and the Manage∣ment
of her Family and Houshold, or
to oppose any of her Designs, however
laudable and useful for the good of her
Tenants; (at which words the Assembly,
in token of Gratitude, and accepting the
Offer, stood all up) and Mynheer ma∣king
another <HI>Dutch</HI> Bow went on—</P>
<P>He told them, that he was still very
ready to settle Matters of Trade for
this part of the World, if they would
but stick fast to their old Maxims of lea∣ving
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
it all to him, and being willing that
his Interest should be secured first and
then their own brought in as subservi∣ent;
and finally, he profest himself ready
to require their Kindness at all times,
if he might but enjoy the Benefit of
their Trade, exclusive of themselves, <HI>as
he had d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne.</HI></P>
<P>He then came to the main Point: He
told them, that he understood there
was a private Clandestine Negociation
on foot between Merchant <HI>Traffick</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> and his Partner <HI>Henry Woolpack</HI> of
the <HI>West,</HI> for a Partnership with Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the Articles whereof, if
they came to be <HI>made Effectual,</HI> would be
very prejudicial to his Affairs, and that
therefore he desired their utmost As∣sistance
against is: He told them, that
this Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was always Partner
with him, and had left him without
warning, that it would disable him
from driving his Trade, and consequent∣ly
from buying so many Woollen Ma∣nufactures
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as he used to do because
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would take them here him∣self,
and, in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt he told them that
if they had any Respect for him, or
expected any of his Assistance in their
other secret Affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which he had al∣ways
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
been their Friend in, they must
stand his Friend at this time, and pre∣vent
the Articles of this Partnership from
being MADE EFFECTUAL.</P>
<P>Then he fell to railing at Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> told them he was a <HI>Frenchman</HI>
and a <HI>Papist,</HI> and a tricking false Fel∣low
that never kept his word with any
Body, that he was a Bankrupt, and not
able to make good what he had pro∣mised,
that he would crowd them with
his own Goods, such as Wine, Brandy,
Silk, Linnen, Paper, &amp;c. but would
take little or nothing of them in re∣turn,
only give them large Promises
and good Words, with which he would
feed them till the Partnership was set∣tled
and made effectual, and then he
would laugh at them; and with much
more of this kind he ended his Speech.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Mynheer <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> having thus fi∣nished
his Speech and sat down, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> the
Chairman seeing the Club in an unusual
Agitation, and mightily incensed against
Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and also against Alderman
<HI>Traffick</HI> and his Partners, called for a Bottle
of <HI>Neat-Port,</HI> for they always drink <HI>Port</HI> at
that Club, and beginning a Health, <HI>which
for their Reputations sake, as they pretend to be
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
Christians,</HI> is not fit to be named; the unna∣tural
Pleasure of that Infamous practice
took them a little off of their Fury. Indeed
Authors do not say it cooled the Ferment
they were in, but it turned it another
way, tho' by a worse Inflamation, and
having twice Cursed the <HI>Landlady,</HI> and
five times her Servants, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> stood up,
and addressing himself to <HI>Mynheer,</HI> he
spoke in the Name of the whole Society,
by way of Answer to his Speech, to the
purpose following.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'FIrst, He told him they were very
glad the Endeavours of the Club
had been of Service to him, that they
had faithfully pursued his Interest at all
times, without respect to any Obligation
they were under to the contrary, either
to their <HI>Landlady,</HI> or otherwise; and that
it was very much to their Satisfaction
that he was sensible thereof.</P>
<P>They condoled with him, <HI>he said,</HI> in
all his Misfortunes; particularly that
which he had mentioned to them, <HI>viz.</HI>
of having the <HI>British</HI> Merchants get the
better of him in all his projects of Trade,
especially that with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Philippo,</HI> and his Factor Seignior
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which he could not but be sen∣sible
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
they had done their Endeavour to
prevent; however it might be against
the Honour and the Interest of their
Country.'</P>
<P>'He told him, <HI>the Club</HI> was very sorry
they had been any way instrumental to
the loss of that Voyage of his, where
his Ships were taken, his Goods plun∣dered,
and his Men thrown overboard,
or carryed into Slavery; but that the
Advice they gave him for adhering to
his <HI>German Partnership,</HI> was chiefly foun∣ded
on the Assurances, which he had sent
them word were given him, that Mer∣chant
<HI>Eugene,</HI> who was Factor for
Mynheer <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> would carry on that
Trade successfully, without any farther
help, or any Auxiliary Stock; and that
they never suspected that those Promises
of <HI>Merchant Eugene</HI> had been all but
meer Gasconades, and that he was not
able to perform them, for that the said
<HI>Eugene</HI> was always esteemed an expert
Merchant, and one who being bred to
Business, always <HI>kept right Accounts,</HI> and
might be depended upon in Adventures
of the nicest Nature; that therefore the
Miscarriage ought to be placed to Mer∣chant
<HI>Eugene</HI>'s Account, and not to
theirs, who had advised him for the best.'</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>'
He told him, the Society were sorry
he had been obliged to quit his <HI>German
Partnership</HI> in such a manner as he did;
but they were glad <HI>for his sake,</HI> that he
had at last put an end to it, being afraid
his <HI>German</HI> Partner would ruin him∣self,
by following the precipitant Mea∣sures
of his said Factor Merchant <HI>Eu∣gene,</HI>
especially in carrying on that Trade,
which was too hazardous and expensive
for <HI>his</HI> Strength of Stock; and that it
was rumoured already upon Change,
that his Bills had been protested in di∣vers
parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> so that it was
feared we should quickly hear there was
a Commission of Bankrupt taken out
against him, and that he would make a
Composition with his Creditors.'</P>
<P>'He told him, tho' the Society had
been disappointed in every thing they
had undertaken for him, and were at
this time but in mean Circumstances;
their Character declining, their Repu∣tation
very low, and most of their valu∣able
Men gone off from them to the
Interest of their <HI>Landlady,</HI> having by
her Advice joined in a new Partnership
with Merchant <HI>Moderation,</HI> an old and
known Enemy to the whole Society,
yet as their Spirit (<HI>Malice</HI>) was not in
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
the least abated, and that they had yet
Members enough left to make a great
Effort (Noise) in his Favour, so he
might depend upon their utmost Assist∣ance
in every thing whatsoever that
he desired; in return whereof, they
hoped <HI>Mynheer</HI> would continue to be
their constant Friend and Correspon∣dent
in the same manner as he had
done before; adding, that they had one
farther Request to make to him, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That whereas they might probably find
it needful sometimes, in carrying on
his Intrigues, or their own; to make
themselves obnoxious to the Law, and
which was likely to be very frequent,
to fly from Justice, run away from Bail,
and <HI>such like,</HI> he would engage to re∣ceive
their Criminals, and make them
Burgesses in his Cities and free Denizens,
Naturalizing them among the Servants
of his Family, as would be most sui∣table
to them, and to him also, whe∣ther
they were felonious-Bankrupts,
Murtherers of Nobility, Duellers, Scots
Libellers, Traytors, or what kind of Of∣fenders
soever.'</P>
<P>'That as to the new Treaty of Part∣nership
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> he told him
there was no doubt but the Club would
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
espouse his Cause, <HI>right</HI> or <HI>wrong,</HI> against
that <HI>Frenchman</HI> and all his Attempts;
that the name of <HI>French</HI> would make it
exceeding Popular, and they would pre∣sently
spread it over the whole Nation,
that he was a Pick-pocket, a Conjurer,
and dealt with the Devil, and they
doubted not to have him Mobb'd if he
came hither.'</P>
<P>'He <HI>told him,</HI> that as to Alderman <HI>Traf∣fick,</HI>
he knew he was an eminent Dealer,
and understood Trade, and perhaps he
might be steady as to his old Notions of
the Liberty of Trade; but as for ho∣nest
<HI>Woolpack</HI> he knew him well enough,
that he was a well-meaning Country-Fellow,
but very Passionate, and
Ignorant, and he did not question but
the Club would find means to Impose
upon his Judgment, by telling him a
hundred Stories and Shams of this
<HI>Frenchman Count Tariff;</HI> and if they
did but once make him believe that
<HI>Count Tariff</HI> would take off none of his
Manufactures, he would go stark Mad,
and break off the new Partnership at
once, or quarrel with Alderman <HI>Traf∣fick</HI>
his Partner, and refuse to go on
with the Trade; concluding upon the
whole, in the Name of the Society,
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
that he might depend upon it, they
were all <HI>Mynheers</HI> hearty Friends more
than their own.'</P></Q>
<P>The Chairman having ended his Speech,
a Tool of his who sat at his Elbow, lately
turned Malecontent because he was left
out of a certain Commission, made a mo∣tion
to the Club, that they should declare
their Assent to all that Sir <HI>Pol</HI> had said,
which was done, the following Minute
being extracted out of the Journal of the
Club.</P>
<Q>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente,</Q>
<P>That the Thanks of the Club be given
to Sir <HI>Pol Falshood</HI> the Chairman, for his
excellent Speech to Mynheer <HI>van Coop∣manschap.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> having gone thus far, proceeded
then to put the <HI>grand Question,</HI> which was
also carried, as follows.</P>
<Q>Resolved, Nemine Contradicente,</Q>
<P>That this Club will stand by, assist,
and support <HI>Mynheer van Coopmanschap,</HI>
their old and constant Partner, Confede∣rate
and Ally, with all their Art and
Skill, not only against <HI>Count Tariff</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> but against all the <HI>Harry
Woolpacks</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and against all other
Opposers whatsoever, <HI>Landlady</HI> and all.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
This Vote being past, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> stood up and
made another Speech, and directed him∣self
then to the <HI>Club, Mynheer</HI> being with∣drawn,
in which he spoke with a great
deal of Heat, and with all that Sense and
Passion he used to speak with elsewhere.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'He told them, that having heard
what had been said by <HI>Mynheer van Coop∣manschap,</HI>
and what return had been
made to him, he expected no other, but
that they would Resolve to assist and
stand by him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as they had done;
and that now having thus entered upon
the thing, the next and immediate Step
was, that they should consider of <HI>Ways</HI>
and <HI>Means,</HI> to put in execution what
they had Resolved on; that no time was
to be lost; that they expected every Post
to hear that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was come over,
and that the Articles of Partnership be∣tween
him and Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> &amp;c.
would presently be Ratifyed, and a Law
pass to make them EFFECTUAL,
and that then all was lost, and their fast
Friend <HI>Coopmanschap</HI> would be ruined.'</P>
<P>'Then he run out in the praise of <HI>Myn∣heer,</HI>
how necessary it was to them to
Support him, how they could never
hope to carry on their secret Designs
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
against the <HI>Landlady,</HI> if they lost <HI>Mynheer,</HI>
and that all their Trade (juggling) which
they had carried on so long with <HI>Mynheer
van Coopmanschap</HI> would be spoiled, if
they did not prevent it just now.'</P>
<P>'<HI>Then he fell foul upon Count Tariff,</HI> you
have heard his Character, said he, from
<HI>Mynheer van Coopmanschap</HI>'s own Mouth,
what a Tricking, Cozening, Bankrupt
Fellow he is, and what a Trade we are
like to have with him, if this Partner∣ship
should proceed; and therefore, <HI>con∣tinued
Sir Pol,</HI> my good Friends, I would
not have you be deceived by those who
talk of your having a great Trade with
him; It is all a Cheat: How should
he want any of your Manufactures when
he can make them all himself by his own
Tenants and Servants whom he has
lately set up, and given great Encou∣ragement
to them out of his own Estate?
and as to the defect of Wooll, which
they pretend to say will prevent this,
that is effectually Answered by the News
which came to me by the last Post, and
which I thought fit to communicate to
you, that it may by your Diligence and
Correspondence in the Country, be
spread about among the Woollen Manu∣facturers
and Clothiers of <HI>Britain, (viz.</HI>)
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
That this Count <HI>Tariff</HI> has found out a
new Invention not only to supply his
own Tenants and Servants with good
Woollen Manufactures, but that in a
little time he would be able to supply
the whole World with Woollen Manu∣factures,
even <HI>Britain</HI> and all; for that
by this new Invention, they could make
FINE Manufactures of COARSE Wooll,
and he was told of another new Project
setting up just now among them of making
all the <HI>English</HI> Manufactures in <HI>France with∣out
any Wooll AT ALL,</HI> which, if they
should bring to Perfection, <HI>as he feared
they would,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Trade would be
quite ruined, and the <HI>French</HI> Tenants of
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> would Undersell them at
all the Markets in <HI>Europe,</HI> so that he
doubted not but <HI>the Club</HI> would be con∣vinced
that it was their own Interest as
well as his, to prevent Count <HI>Tariff</HI> en∣tering
into any Measures here.'</P></Q>
<P>The Club were mightily affected with
this part of Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Speech, and the Noise
interrupted him for some time; they ap∣peared
in a great Consternation, as well
they might, at the mention of such a Pro∣ject
being set on foot in <HI>France,</HI> for making
<HI>Broad-Cloth, Sarges,</HI> &amp;c. WITHOUT
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
WOOLL, and a wise Senator of the Club
wrs observed to shake his Head, and with
a deep Sigh to send forth this Ejaculation,
LAURD! said he, <HI>What will become of
poor</HI> England! <HI>This will ruin us all with a
Witness!</HI> What! <HI>The</HI> French <HI>Manufactures</HI>
without Wooll! good lack! <HI>This is the ef∣fect
of making Peace with the</HI> French! <HI>This
is a</HI> French <HI>Popish Project indeed! I'll war∣rant
the</HI> New Ministry <HI>have a Hand in
it! We shall be all undone! alas! poor</HI>
England.</P>
<P>There was a general Murmur thro
the whole Society on this surprizing In∣formation,
insomuch that the House seem∣ed
in some Commotion, and Sir <HI>Pol</HI> could
not yet proceed; but the wise Expressions
which on that Occasion dropt from sundry
Members of the Society being yet reserved
in Whispers only; History has made men∣tion
of no more than what is hinted above,
which Silence has been a sensible loss to
Posterity, who are thereby deprived of
the many weighty Sentences dropt on that
Occasion.</P>
<P>After some time, the Club being a lit∣tle
recovered, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> reassumed his for∣mer
Discourse, and went on to lay down
his Measures, which, <HI>as he said,</HI> he would
have them take to prosecute this Design,
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
and the Ways and Means thereof, as
aforesaid: And <HI>First,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'He told them he had been with <HI>Al∣derman
Traffick,</HI> and it is true, <HI>says he,</HI> I
found him inflexible, he talked loudly of
the vast Advantages of the Partnership
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> the great Quantities
of <HI>English</HI> Manufactures he was formerly
accustomed to take off, and would now
again take off of our Hands; but said
Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> I will confute them all by one
piece of Conduct of mine, for since <HI>Al∣derman
Traffick</HI> cannot be brought over,
we must overpower him, and run him
down by our Numbers and Noise; for
this end, <HI>says he,</HI> it is absolutely necessary
to separate <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> from him,
<HI>that is,</HI> to sow such Jealousies and Mis∣understandings
between the Country
Manufacturers and the Merchants, that
they may not join together in this Part∣nership;
and therefore, <HI>continues he,</HI> I
design in the next place, to attack my
old Acquaintance <HI>Harry Woolpack,</HI> and I
doubt not, with a little help, to make
this Affair so popular, that I will make
<HI>Harry</HI> ashamed to show his Face in the
Country, if he does not break off this
Partnership with <HI>Tariff.</HI>'</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44"/>'
To this purpose, <HI>says he,</HI> we must in
the first place, set to work all our Agents
to expose, bespatter, villify, blacken,
and defame Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and that not
only here in the Town, which we can
do by the Assistance of our Friends at
<HI>North</HI>'s, and at the <HI>Amsterdam</HI> Coffee-Houses,
not forgetting our learned States∣men
at the <HI>Grecian;</HI> but also in all the
Cloathing and Manufacturing Towns
and Countries throughout <HI>England;</HI> for
this Work, <HI>says he,</HI> turning to two
<HI>Blackwell-Hall-Factors,</HI> who sat next him,
here's my Friend <HI>Josiah White-Cloth</HI> and
<HI>Phil. Medley,</HI> Men of Interest in the
Country, shall write our Minds to <HI>Harry
Wool-pack;</HI> and if they should not be
able to prevail, there's old <HI>Joshua Double-dozen,</HI>
the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Man, shall threaten
him with his Mob out of the <HI>North;</HI>
and there is no doubt but <HI>Harry Wooll∣pack</HI>
will come up to Town, and tell
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> to his Face, that he
will have nothing to do with Count
<HI>Tariff.</HI>'</P></Q>
<P>Sir <HI>Poll</HI> received several Humms, and
other Testimonies of Applause, from the
Club, as he went on with this; by which
they signified their full Approbation of
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
every thing he said to them; which en∣couraged
him to proceed as follows.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'<HI>He told them,</HI> the breaking of <HI>Harry
Wooll-pack</HI> from his Engagements with
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> was, <HI>tho' in it self a
Trifle,</HI> of very great Consequence to
many other of their Designs, as well as
this of Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> for it would im∣mediately
affect all the People of <HI>Bri∣tain;</HI>
it would alarm all the Manufa∣cturers,
and make them believe their
Trade was to be lost and undone, and
that they should be ruined; it will
make, <HI>says he,</HI> all the Clothing Towns
write up to their Representatives, and
perswade them that all is at stake, and
that they'll CHOOSE them NO
MORE, if they do not take care about
it in Parliament: nay, <HI>says Sir Poll in
some Extacy,</HI> it is not to be imagined
how far we may run this Thought; I
question not, <HI>srys he,</HI> but we shall make
it a <HI>DOCTOR SACHEVERELL</HI> to us,
and perhaps may make as good use of
it for our purpose, as was made by
other People of that Affair of Dr. <HI>Sache∣verell</HI>'s,
which it is evident was impro∣ved
to a quite contrary purpose to what
it was designed for; and as the former
part said he will be easily managed by
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
our Assistants at the places before named,
so we can never want a Detachment of
Bullies from <HI>Jenny Man</HI>'s and <HI>St. James</HI>'s
Coffee-house, to assist in the latter, and
make a Tumult for us if there be occa∣sion.'</P>
<P>'Our Business then, <HI>continued he,</HI> is to
raise <HI>Harry Wool pack</HI>'s Passions, for he
is naturally a hot-headed Fellow, and
as furious and inconsiderate <HI>as my self</HI>
when he is moved; and when we have
screw'd him up to a pitch, he'll make
<HI>such a Noise,</HI> no body <HI>else</HI> shall be heard
all over the Kingdom but he: besides,
he has a prodigious Interest in the
Country; as well <HI>Landed-men</HI> and <HI>Tra∣ding-men,</HI>
as <HI>Monied-men,</HI> they are all of
his side; and if once he raises his Voice,
he can call a strange multitude about
him: There's <HI>Sergius Perpetuanus</HI> the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> of <HI>Exeter,</HI> is always at his El∣bow,
with an hundred thousand <HI>Devon∣shire-men,</HI>
and as many from <HI>Taunton∣dean;</HI>
There's <HI>Joshua Double-dozen</HI> and
<HI>Tom Kersie</HI> out of the <HI>North,</HI> from <HI>Hal∣lifax</HI>
and <HI>Leeds;</HI> they were famous for
their Numbers in Qu. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time:
Then there's <HI>Goad Cotton</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Fla∣nel
ap Plane</HI> the Welch-man; they are
all at his Beck, and are able to raise
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
all <HI>North-Wales, Shropshire,</HI> and <HI>Lanca∣shire</HI>
for him; besides <HI>Henry Stroudwater</HI>
of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> Sir <HI>Isaac Re-Bay</HI> of <HI>Colche∣ster,
Jack All-Stuff</HI> of <HI>Norwich, Benjamin
Drugget</HI> of <HI>Newberry,</HI> and several others,
who are all such Dependants upon this
<HI>Wooll-pack,</HI> that if he does but hold up
his Finger, they are at his Beck; so
that, <HI>in short,</HI> the Sum of this Matter
is to perswade <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> to break
this Bargain, and to fright him with
the Apprehensions of losing all his
Trade. Let us get but this done then,
<HI>says he,</HI> and we need not value <HI>Old Traf∣fick;</HI>
for if he insists upon it never so
much, if <HI>Wool-pack</HI> does not come in,
it can never go on, or be made EFFE∣CTUAL.'</P>
<P>'It follows next, says <HI>Sir Pol,</HI> that we
consider of the Methods to bring this
to pass; and the only way to do this,
<HI>as I said before,</HI> is to bespatter Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> and heap up all the Scandal we
can upon him, by which we shall make
him frightful and odious to <HI>Wooll-pack</HI>
and his Friends; and if he should ven∣ture
after this to come over hither, to
get the Articles of his new Partnership
made EFFECTUAL, we'll bring <HI>Har∣ry
Wooll-pack</HI> in, as Plaintiff, get him In∣dicted
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
for a Cheat, and a Pick-pocket,
and have him Tried for his Life.</P></Q>
<P>This Speech was too full of Gall, Party-Rage,
and particular Malice, not to suit
well and be very acceptable to the whole
Assembly; for Temper and Moderation
was long ago hiss'd out of the Club, as
an Enemy to the Being and Nature of
their Constitution; like a Coward, who
is Troop'd out of a Camp by <HI>Beat of
Drum,</HI> as a Person of no manner of use
in the Army.</P>
<P>Being then sufficiently prepared by this
Plan of their Proceedings, laid down by
<HI>Sir Poll,</HI> they fell to work immediately,
and first they voted that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was
a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and therefore let the Gain
of the Partnership be what it would, we
had better be without him. This was
voted with such a Clamour in the Club,
that nothing could be heard for a great
while but the repeated Cry of No <HI>French
Man!</HI> no <HI>French Wine!</HI> no <HI>French Trade!</HI>
no <HI>Brandy!</HI> sell no Manufactures to a
<HI>French-man!</HI> and the like.</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'The last Word startled a certain
<HI>Warehouse-man</HI> in the Club, whose Inte∣rest
could not tell how to lye like the
rest, <HI>Hold there a little, says he,</HI> sell no
Manufactures to a <HI>French-man!</HI> Hang it,
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
<HI>says he,</HI> I can't go that Length neither,
for I sold one of Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Friends
a thousand Pounds worth of Druggets
and Serges but last Week: <HI>That won't do
says he;</HI> and so taking the Opportunity
of the Hurry, he sneak'd out of the
Club.'</P></Q>
<P>But the Vote passed, <HI>as above,</HI> with too
much Noise for any thing of Reason
or Argument to be heard. This was no
sooner over, but another Wise-man stands
up, (whether he was a <HI>Salter</HI> or a <HI>Grocer,</HI>
Authors are not agreed about it.) But
addressing himself to the Chair, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Sir Pol,</HI>
says he. I understand this Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
is a <HI>French-man,</HI> then to be sure he is a
<HI>Jacobite,</HI> and will bring in the <HI>Pretender</HI>
upon us; <HI>ergo,</HI> all they who are for
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> are <HI>Jacobites.</HI> I desire it
may be put to the Question; which was
done thus:'</Q></P>
<P>RESOLVED, That it is the Opinion
of this Society, that all those who are
for Trading with a <HI>French-man</HI> are <HI>JA∣COBITES:</HI>
Upon which the House divi∣ded,
<HI>Yeas 116, No's</HI> 11.</P>
<P>So it was carried by a great Majority;
But that not being satisfactory to the Ci∣tizen
who proposed it, <HI>who was for thorough
Work,</HI> he moved again, and said, it was a
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
Dishonour to the Club, that such a signi∣ficant
Vote <HI>as that</HI> should not have passed
<HI>Nemine contradicente;</HI> and therefore the
11 <HI>No</HI>'s ought to be Expelled the House,
<HI>which was accordingly done.</HI></P>
<P>The 11 Members who were voted ex∣pell'd,
desired to explain themselves; but
a Scots Pamphleteer, <HI>since fled from Justice,</HI>
stood up, <HI>and said,</HI> the Tories condemned
a Peer to lose his Head, in his Country,
for offering an Explanation to a publick
Act: and he was sure those 11 Members
were Tories in Disguise; for sure none
but a Tory would Trade with a <HI>French∣man;</HI>
and therefore he was for farther
Prosecution against them: <HI>Ʋpon which</HI> the
11 withdrew, for fear of some of his
Justice.</P>
<P>The next Question was, <HI>What Religion
Count</HI> Tariff <HI>was of?</HI> This produced a hi∣deous
Cry, of a <HI>Papish,</HI> a <HI>Papish,</HI> a <HI>Papish!</HI>
no Trade with a <HI>Papish!</HI> no Trade with
a <HI>Papish!</HI> and such as that: and this rung
round the Club-Room, like a Vote in the
Common-Hall when a Sheriff is put up
from the Hustings, which is usually a
Quarter of an Hour a sounding.</P>
<P>After many Debates of this nature, <HI>it
was resolved,</HI> That the Votes of the Club
should be made publick, and be sent down
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
into the <HI>West</HI> to their honoured Friend <HI>Hen∣ry
Wooll-pack,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and, that he be admo∣nished
by his trusty Correspondent <HI>Josiah
White-cloth,</HI> and <HI>Phil. Medley,</HI> that as it is
resolved in the Committee, that it cannot
be safe for <HI>England</HI> that he should trade
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> who is a <HI>French-man,</HI>
a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and a <HI>Papist;</HI> so that this is
the Advice of the whole Club to him, and
that he should take care not to be wheed∣led
into it by Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> for that
altho' the said <HI>Traffick</HI> was an experienc'd
Merchant, and generally speaking, an
honest Man; yet he was lately turned
about, and was on the wrong Side; that
it was to be feared he was inclined to the
<HI>Pretender,</HI> and therefore he should have
a care of him; for if he was drawn in
to join in the Partnership, he was un∣done.</P>
<P><HI>Nor did they stop here;</HI> but they order'd
that the Character of Count <HI>Tariff</HI> should
be defamed, and bespattered as much as
possible by their Scots Pamphleteer afore∣said,
as long as he durst stay for fear of
the Pillory; and by their <HI>Lying Posts,</HI> their
daily Libels, circular Letters, and scurri∣lous
Prints of every kind, for which they
had their Authors and Printers of the So∣ciety
always in Pay: and they gave them
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
a general Order, not to stick at any thing,
so it would but blacken Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick;</HI> nor to stick at any
Person that spake in their behalf, tho' it
were the <HI>Landlady</HI> herself; agreeing also,
that they would carry on the same De∣sign
themselves in all their Conversation,
and at all the Committees of their Socie∣ty
held at the usual Places, <HI>to wit,</HI> the <HI>Gre∣cian,
Jenny Man</HI>'s, <HI>St. James</HI>'s, and those
in the City, <HI>viz. North</HI>'s, the <HI>Amsterdam,
Hamlin</HI>'s, &amp;c. and that this should be car∣ried
on universally, without Respect of
Persons as aforesaid; but especially upon
their <HI>Landlady,</HI> who they reported to be
sick and dying, and openly acknowledged
they <HI>wish'd it was so,</HI> till the Brewer in
<HI>Thames-street</HI> was taken up for it, which
terrified the disbanded Officer aforesaid,
and others his Neighbours, and made
them more careful of their Tongues.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI>
whose Genius was turned for Trade, and
who understood it better than Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> or
any of them, being convinc'd that the
Partnership with Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was well-grounded,
and that it was calculated for
the general Good, not of himself only,
but of his Partner <HI>Harry Wooll-pack,</HI> and
all his Dependants, he resolved to regard
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
none of them, but to go on steadily in
his Design of making the Partnership
EFFECTUAL.</P>
<P>But the Alderman knowing what sort
of People he had to do with and what
he was to expect from them afterwards;
that he might leave them without Excuse,
resolved to have their own Testimonials
to what he was doing; and therefore long
before he concluded the Treaty for this
Partnership by his Agents abroad, he
s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Letters down into the Country, not
only to <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> himself, but to all
his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rementioned Friends and Dealers,
such as <HI>Joshua Double-dozen</HI> of <HI>Leeds. Tom
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Perpetuanus</HI> of <HI>Exe∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI>
Sir <HI>Isaac <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Colchester, Goad Cot∣ton</HI>
<ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and <HI>Flannel ap Plane.</HI> Clothiers of
<HI>North-Wales;</HI> and to many more, which it
would be too long to name here signifying
his Intention of entering into Partnership
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and asking their Opini∣on
of the same, whether they thought it
might be for the Publick Advantage or
no; particularly and expresly desiring
them, if they had any Objections to make,
or any thing to propose for their own Ad∣vantage
in the said Trade and Partner∣ship
with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> that they would
send up their said Requests and Objecti∣ons
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
before the Partnership was conclu∣ded,
and particularly their Opinions as
to the Trade it self, after it should be
agreed, whether it was for the Publick
Advantage or no.</P>
<P>In Answer to this, <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> in
particular, and all the rest also, however
they have been misguided since, sent up
long Memorials and Representations, ex∣pressing
their full Satisfaction in the said
Partnership, and proposing such and such
Alterations and Additions as they thought
necessary to be provided against, altered
or added; upon doing whereof, <HI>they all</HI>
gave it under their hands, that the said
<HI>Partnership</HI> would be very advantageous
to them, and that a Trade with Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> had been <HI>before,</HI> and would be <HI>again,</HI>
with such Regulations, a very beneficial
Trade to them and all their Neighbours:
Which Memorials and Representations,
under their Hands, are yet to be produ∣ced
to their Faces, when occasion re∣quires.</P>
<P>As
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> was thus confirm∣ed
in his Opinion of the Goodness of
his Design, not only by his own Judgment,
but by the said Memorials and Repre∣sentations
of <HI>Harry Woollpack,</HI> and all his
Friends, he gave Count <HI>Tariff</HI> an Invita∣tion
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
to come over to <HI>England,</HI> in order to
have the Partnership consummated, and
the Articles MADE EFFECTUAL,
who accordingly arrived here the 31st
Day of <HI>March</HI> last, being the same Day
that Sir <HI>Pol</HI> laid the Plan in the Club for
his Destruction, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>No sooner was the <HI>Count</HI> arrived, but the
Club began to put their Measures, <HI>which they
had resolved on,</HI> in Execution: And FIRST,
In order to make the Affair of the said
Partnership a <HI>Party-Cause,</HI> they railed at
him as a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and caused a Report
to be spread all over the Kingdom, that
he had brought the <HI>Pretender</HI> with him,
and particularly they took care to make
<HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> really believe it; which
was the first beginning of the Breach on
that Side.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Count,</HI> who never knew what
<HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> meant, and was of no Party,
but for the Universal Good of Mankind,
was surprized to hear them call him a <HI>Ja∣cobite,</HI>
and askt, <HI>What Trade that was?</HI>
<Q REND="inline">'He told them, he never concerned him∣self
with Government, it was his Busi∣ness
always to submit to the legal Esta∣blishment
of the Country he was in,
to pay Customs and Duties chearfully,
and not only to augment the Revenues
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
of the Princes who Reigned, but to as∣sist
and enable their People to pay chear∣fully
and willingly whatever the Laws
obliged them to; that it was his con∣stant
Custom to acknowledge the Power,
but never concerned himself about the
Persons Reigning, much less about those
who should or should not succeed;
and that for being a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> he knew
nothing of it.'</Q></P>
<P>But let the <HI>Count</HI> say what he would,
it was to no purpose, Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his
Club had Voted it, and the Cry was gone
out into the Country, that Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
was come over with the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dor,
and had brought over the <HI>Pretender,</HI>
nay, and that he was actually lodged in
<HI>Somerset-house:</HI> The Design of this was to
have the <HI>Count</HI> Mobb'd and torn to pieces
in the Street; <HI>or else,</HI> which would an∣swer
<HI>Mynheer Coopmanschap</HI>'s end better,
that he should be terrified with the Ap∣prehensions
of it, and should be obliged
to retire with him to <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>But they were disappointed in the first
part of their Project, for the <HI>Count</HI> ha∣ving
given Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> full Satis∣faction,
that he was a Person wholly con∣cerned
in Matters of Trade, and in them
only; and that he desired to have no
<PB N="58" REF="57"/>
other Busines, here; the <HI>Alderman</HI> pro∣tected
him from the Mob, and from the
fury of Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and also cleared up his
Character, as to <HI>Jacobitism,</HI> well enough.</P>
<P>The Party then finding themselves un∣able
to hurt the <HI>Count</HI> this way, apply
themselves to their OTHER METHOD,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) To attack his Character, as to
Trade; and here indeed they met with
better Success, tho' it was by the help
of the most scandalous Methods, and the
unjust Practices in the World, as will
appear in the sequel of our History.</P>
<P>To enter into the better Description of
these things, we must go back to the
<HI>Club,</HI> and to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> their Director: Sir
<HI>Pol,</HI> who is naturally Cholerick, and abo∣minably
revengeful, having been heated
with the Disappointment he had received,
<HI>as above,</HI> and not being able to get the
<HI>Count</HI> Mobb'd for a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and for
bringing over the <HI>Pretender;</HI> he called <HI>a
Club</HI> on a <HI>Saturday</HI> Night late, and co∣ming
into the Assembly in a great Passion,
told them, the Alderman had basely enter∣tained
Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> by Authority; and that
he believed that even the LANDLADY
her self was a <HI>Jacobite;</HI> and he did not
question but the <HI>Pretender</HI> might have
been found hid under Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Cloak,
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
or was pack'd up in his Equipage, if
the Officers might have searched him;
whereas Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had forbidden
them to Affront him; but that he had
been even both with the <HI>Alderman</HI> and
the <HI>Landlady</HI> too for that, and had ta∣ken
Care they should be both Exposed
for it over the whole Nation; and upon
this he called for the <HI>Scots</HI> Pampleeter
who pulled out two Printed Ballads,
which, he said, would do their Business;
one was <HI>The Merchant Alamode;</HI> the other
<HI>The Ambassadresses Speech,</HI> which he gave
about to the whole Club, and ordered
Copies to be distributed to <HI>Harry Wooll∣pack</HI>
and his Friends, by the Printer to the
Society.</P>
<P><HI>It was true,</HI> that those Wicked Mea∣sures
of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Fraternity, did
a little stagger <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends, so that they began to decline the
Partnership which Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had
made, and sent up Letters and Addresses to
the <HI>Alderman,</HI> not to go on with it; and
made some Clamours against making it
EFFECTUAL, as shall be shewn in its
place; which Proceedings occasioned some
delay in the Matter at first, but their Eyes
were soon opened, and they were all
convinced of their Mistake at last; and
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
tho' 'tis true it was too late to retrieve
the first Damages of the thing, yet it
taught them to know Sir <HI>Pol</HI> a little bet∣ter
than they did before, and to have a
care of him accordingly; which tended,
in the end, to the Effectual settling the
Affair. But to return to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and the
Club.</P>
<P>The Club received his last Harangue
with great Satisfaction, and were more
especially diverted with the Ballads; for
any thing that affronted their <HI>Landlady</HI>
was always agreeable to the Club: But
their Mirth was almost spoiled by an un∣lucky
Motion, made by one of their own
Body, <HI>tho' Innocently,</HI> for he was as much a
well-wisher to Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and to his Country's
disorder, as any of them, but was not
let into the whole Secrets of Management,
and did not know that the Work was to
be done <HI>Per fas</HI> aut <HI>Ne fas:</HI> This grave
Citizen was a <HI>Warehouseman</HI> by Occupa∣tion,
and therefore mightily concerned
for the Woollen Manufacture, tho' History
has not recorded his Name: This Man
standing up in his place, told the Chair∣man
that he approved very well of what
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> had proposed, as to defaming and
blackning Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and his Adherents,
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and his Friends
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
against the proposed Partnership, and to
raise the Mob upon <HI>Count Tariff;</HI> only,
<HI>says he,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'I think it would be necessary to
get a certain eminent old Citizen,
whom I was formerly acquainted with,
on our Side, in all we do of this Na∣ture;
one, says he, you have all heard
of, for he fined for Alderman in the time
of Sir <HI>William Turner,</HI> was well ac∣quainted
with the <HI>French</HI> Trade; and
might be a match for old Alderman
<HI>Traffick,</HI> or any of them, and this is old
Merchant FACT; for, <HI>continues he,</HI> the
Reputation of this old Gentleman is
such, that no Body will question what
we say, if he is on our Side; and on the
other hand, if Count <HI>Tariff</HI> should get
him <HI>from us,</HI> it will put us to a very
great <HI>Nonplus.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this Motion Sir <HI>Pol</HI> stood up, and
first looking about to see if the Door
was shut, and none of the Drawers in
the Room, <Q REND="inline">'GENTLEMEN, <HI>says he,</HI>
what Deputy …….. has proposed
is very good, and would be to the Pur∣pose,
and I have been trying some time
to get this old Gentleman on our Side;
but I must tell you <HI>in Confidence,</HI> that he
is gone out of the way, and <HI>I fear</HI> is
gone over to the Enemy, or at least
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
has withdrawn himself; whereupon,
having seriously bethought my self, I
have found out two Expedients in order
to supply his Place.'</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'1. Says he, I own 'tis absolutely ne∣cessary
to make <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and his
People believe that Merchant FACT
is really on our Side; and therefore I
have resolved to take that part upon
my self, and set up a Counterfeit Mer∣chant
FACT in his room, which I will
show to the Mob, as I find occasion:
nay, rather than fail, says Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> I'll
counterfeit Merchant FACT my self;
indeed I must be concealed from those
People's View who are well acquainted
with his Countenance, or with his Mind;
but as to <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> he will take
any thing we say to him upon Trust;
and we have nothing to do, as to him,
but to say we have got Merchant FACT
on our Side, and he will presently cry
out of all that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and his
Friends can say, that <HI>it is all Lyes,</HI> and
therefore, if you please, leave this to my
Management; it is but putting a good
Face to it: I make no question, but
we shall carry it as well, as if we had
Merchant FACT along with us, for
Noise and Falshood, at this time of
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
Day, will with good Management go
as far as Fact and Truth can do.'</P>
<P>'2. To carry on this Disguise with the
greater certainty of Success, continues
he, I have found out an excellent As∣sistant,
and one that stood a fast Friend
to me, in former Days, when the Citi∣zens
our Ancestors had just such another
Game to play upon King <HI>Charles</HI> II.</P>
<P>This Assistant, <HI>says he,</HI> has misled the
City these thirty Years with such Dex∣terity
and such admirable Success, that
no Body has discovered or detected him
yet, having thirteen or fourteen Hands
of the principal Merchants of <HI>London,</HI>
to a Certificate of his Integrity in the
Year 1674; these he drew in at that
time, without any enquiry, to Vouch
for him, taking all he said upon Trust:
And that I may hold you in suspence
no longer, this is the famous SCHEME
OF TRADE brought up with old
<HI>Whiston,</HI> the Devil's Broker, and as ac∣curate
a Lvar as ever his Master was.'</P></Q>
<P>The Assembly received this Proposal of
Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s with a general Approbation, and
recommended to him the necessary Dis∣patch:
In the mean time, Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
began to appear abroad again, and Al∣derman
<HI>Traffick</HI> declared that he had en∣tered
<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
into Partnership with him, and
that he had resolved to apply to the <HI>Land∣lady</HI>
to have the Articles of the said Part∣nership
MADE EFFECTUAL by Law.</P>
<P>Now was Sir <HI>Pol</HI> to play his Game, or
never, for Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> pushed on
his Design to a Hearing, before such Judges
as the LANDLADY had directed it to
be laid before; wherefore, <HI>in the First
place,</HI> Sir <HI>Pol</HI> attacks him with publick
Defamation, <HI>as was agreed before,</HI> and
spread a thousand Clandestine Stories
about of his Behaviour; as that he was
Clandestinely run away from his Part∣ners
abroad, that he had broke his
word there, and never kept his Arti∣cles
with any Body; so that there was
no depending upon any thing he said;
that he was a Bankrupt, and had not
paid his Debts, and therefore it was not
safe to enter into any Treaty of Part∣nership
with him; that he pretended
to come hither for Trade, and to buy
a great many Woollen Manufactures,
but that his Design was of another kind;
that he was no Friend to Trade at all,
but a meer <HI>Papish,</HI> and a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and
had a Design to bring in the <HI>Pretender;</HI>
that he intended not to buy any of
our Manufactures, and was so far from
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
wanting Woollen Manufactures at
home, that he was the Inventor and
Encourager of that new Invention among
his own Tenants, of making <HI>fine</HI> Goods
of <HI>coarse</HI> Wooll, as abovesaid; and of
making sundry Woollen Manufactures
without any Wooll AT ALL; in
which he had made a very considerable
Progress; now tho' among Merchants,
this way of Defaming a Man, is very
Barbarous and Infamous also, yet Count
<HI>Tariff</HI> bore it without any Concern, and
went on with his Business.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and his Party, then finding
this would not do neither, and that <HI>Count
Tariff</HI>'s Reputation was so clear, that if
they did not find out some other way to
Ruin him, he would not carry his Point;
they resolved to spring their <HI>last Mine,</HI>
and blow him up at once; to this pur∣pose
OLD SCHEME, the Fellow men∣tioned
before; who, <HI>as above,</HI> had lived
several Years by Cheating, and Counter∣feiting
Names, making false Accounts,
forming Abstracts of the Custom-House
Books, <HI>and the like,</HI> is brought out to act
his part upon Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> to get him
Indicted for a Cheat, and so they resol∣ved
to bring him to a Tryal. This old
<HI>Knight of the Post</HI> having his Lesson given
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
him, alledged, that the <HI>Count</HI> came hi∣ther
to sell his Goods for ready Mony,
and carry it away in Specie, contrary to
the Act of Parliament in that Case made
and provided; that he had Contracted to
turn OWLER, and carry away our Wooll
<HI>Ʋnmanufactured</HI> into <HI>France;</HI> that all the
Accounts given by Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> of the
large Commissions the <HI>Count</HI> had brought
from <HI>France,</HI> for buying <HI>English</HI> Wooll∣en
Manufactures, was a meer Cheat;
that he had 25 Ships already upon the
Coast loaden with Wine and Brandy,
which must be all paid for in Mony, the
Bills being drawn already, and accepted;
that he was in a Plot to introduce the
French Wines to be the common Draught,
instead of <HI>neat-Port,</HI> contrary to the In∣clination
of our <HI>Soveraign Lord the Peo∣ple;</HI>
and to poison us all with <HI>French</HI> Brandy;
our own Malt Spirits being known to be
much wholsomer.</P>
<P>These, and many other heinous Crimes,
being laid to Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Charge
by this suborner old SCHEME,
they pushed on the Process, and got
Count TARIFF arraigned for a Cheat,
in the Name, and at the Suit of <HI>Henry
Woollpack</HI> and Company; tho' without
their actual Consent too.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="66"/>
The <HI>Count,</HI> who knew his own Inno∣cence,
did not question but in such a
Religious Nation as this was fam'd to be,
he should have Justice done him; and
therefore tho' he might have pleaded <HI>to
the Jurisdiction of the Court,</HI> as having
entered into a Partnership, which those
who contracted it with him, were <HI>un∣doubtedly
impowered</HI> by their own <HI>Natural
Right</HI> to engage in; and that without
giving an Account to any Body; <HI>and
tho' also</HI> he might have pleaded the Law
of Nations for Protection; yet waving
all these things, he frankly offered him∣self
to the Court, and desired to be
brought <HI>to Tryal,</HI> which accordingly was
done.</P>
<P>Upon his Tryal, the usual Forms ha∣ving
passed, and <HI>the Charge</HI> being read,
the first thing that gave the Court some
Diversion, was the detecting Sir <HI>Pol;</HI>
for he had Disguised himself, and appeared
in Court under the Name of MER∣CHANT
FACT; but as he was perso∣nating
the old Man, and endeavouring
also to speak as if he had lost his Teeth,
that he might conceal the Hesitations
which <HI>want of Truth</HI> obliged him fre∣quently
to make; by great Misfortune,
all on a sudden his FALSE BEARD <HI>fell
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
off,</HI> this made him be more strictly ob∣served,
and some Persons in Court, who
formerly had some Acquaintance with the
real Merchant FACT, spoke openly,
and offered to prove that this was not the
Man; upon which all the honest Peo∣ple
that stood by, hissed at him most
intolerably; and if ever he could have
Blushed in his Life, it was thought it
would have been at this time.</P>
<P>Tho' he found himself thus detected, yet
wanting no Assurance, he turned it off with
a ready shift, that indeed he was not Mer∣chant
FACT of <HI>London,</HI> but he was Good∣man
FACT of <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> and he ho∣ped,
he said, that if he was a true FACT,
the Difference of City-Fact or Country-FACT
would not be much.</P>
<P>The Court allowed that in his favour,
and then put him to the proof of what
he had said, for which he appealed all
along to his FACT-OR old <HI>Scheme.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Charge being read, and all
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Voucher <HI>old Scheme</HI> had to
say, being heard with the utmost patience
by the Court; Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was allowed
to speak for himself.</P>
<P>He spoke with great Modesty of him∣self:
He said, <Q REND="inline">'That he was no Cheat,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP="〈◊…〉"/> and had no Evil Design; that he had
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
always been a Friend to the <HI>British</HI>
Commerce, and that he had been sus∣pected
in his own Country on that Ac∣count;
that he came to reside here
for the Benefit of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> that he
could have had very advantageous Con∣ditions,
if he would have joined with
<HI>Mynheer van Coopmanschap,</HI> and never have
come here at all; and that he could still
be very well received, if he would en∣gage
with him, instead of the <HI>English</HI>
Merchants; that he was so far from
being in Debt abroad, that on the
contrary, <HI>Mynheer van Coopmanschap</HI> owed
him twenty Millions of Guilders, and
he was ready to prove it by his Books;
but that he feared very much he should
never get his Money.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'<HI>He told them,</HI> that considering how
well it was known, that he came hi∣ther
with no other Intent but purely
to do the Nation Service, and that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> might not run away with their
Trade; he was surprized that he should
meet with such Treatment: That he
expected better Usage; that he had
been promised he should be Amicably
received when he came hither, and
that by some who <HI>he saw</HI> appeared very
warm against him now, and who he
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
took for Men of more Honour.'</Q> This
Reflected upon <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends who indeed began to be asha∣med
of Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> and to sneak away one
by one.</P>
<P><HI>He went on</HI> to Complain, <Q REND="inline">'That the
Witnesses who appeared against him
were scandalous Fellows; that Mer∣chant
<HI>Fact</HI> was personated indeed, but it
was a Counterfeit; for Merchant FACT
was his old Acquaintance and Corre∣spondent,
and he knew him very well;
he was a <HI>middle sized</HI> FAIR <HI>Gentleman,</HI>
of an honest Countenance, and a calm
composed Temper: But as to that tall,
black, passionate, hangman look'd Fellow,
who called himself Merchant FACT, he
was not in the least like him; and he much
wondered, he said, that any Court of
Justice should admit <HI>counterfeit</HI> FACTS
for <HI>true,</HI> especially after they were so
openly Detected.'</Q></P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'Then, a to OLD SCHEME, <HI>he
said,</HI> he was an Upstart that indeed he
had not heard of before, but upon hear∣ing
his Evidence, he would undertake
to prove upon the spot, that he was
guilty of <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Counterfeiting,</HI> and
that he had practised those things ever
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
since the Year 1674. and he desired he
might call his Witnesses to this.'</P></Q>
<P>The Court was very much moved at
this Discourse, and readily gave the
<HI>Count</HI> leave to call his Witnesses, which
made every Body believe that he would
carry his Cause, and indeed Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s
Friends began to despair for him; for
the <HI>Count</HI> in the first place produced a
whole Cart-load of Books, Draughts, Ac∣counts,
and other Papers from the Cu∣stom-house,
with the proper Officers at∣tending,
to Vouch their being Authen∣tick,
and the Commissioners Hands to
them; upon Examining whereof, it ap∣peared
that OLD SCHEME had really
drawn false Accounts, counterfeited the
Names who he had pretended had at∣tested
them, and that none of all the
Accounts he had produced, agreed with
the Originals in the Custom-house
Books; from whence he pretended he had
copied them.</P>
<P>This caused the Court very much to
resent the Usage they had met with from
the old Knave, and some Authors affirm,
that it was moved he should be exposed,
and his Accounts burnt by the Hangman;
but the turn that afterwards happened to
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
these things, saved him from receiving his
just Reward <HI>at that time.</HI></P>
<P>This put Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Party into a great
Consternation: But Sir <HI>Pol,</HI> who never
was at a loss, produced in the next place,
a great Number of Petitions from Coun∣try
and City, <HI>the first</HI> procured by the
two <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factors, formerly men∣tioned:
These had sent blank Petitions of
their own drawing up, to <HI>Harry Wooll∣pack</HI>'s
Friends all over <HI>England,</HI> telling the
Country Clothiers by Letters, that if they
did not Sign them they were undone; and
their Trade would be all given away to
<HI>France; the last</HI> was from the Weavers
and Companies in <HI>London,</HI> procured by
the same Sollicitation, and most of the said
last Petitions having the same Hands to
them all.</P>
<P>Against these, Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> in be∣half
of Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> produced a Multi∣tude
of Representations from all parts
of <HI>England</HI> to himself, being the same
formerly mentioned, entreating him
to invite Count <HI>Tariff</HI> over hither, and to
engage in Partnership with him; expres∣sing
their great Satisfaction, and how ad∣vantageous
it would be to the Nation, if
he could be prevailed upon to become
Partner with <HI>Harry Woolpack</HI> and himself,
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
as aforesaid; representing also what an
advantageous Trade <HI>Great-Britain</HI> enjoyed
formerly, when the old real Merchant
FACT, and the <HI>Count</HI> corresponded to∣gether:
And that which was most sur∣prizing
in this part of the <HI>Count</HI>'s Defence
was, that many of these Petitions and
Representations were from the very same
Places, and Signed by the very same
Hands which had Signed Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Petiti∣ons,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) from <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI> and his
Friends, abovenamed; which was a clear
Proof, that Party and Faction had pro∣cured
the <HI>last,</HI> and Truth and Reason had
procured the <HI>first.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> finding that it thus went
against him, and that he was in danger
of losing his Cause, had got one Card left
to play, which indeed carried the whole
Cause, and ruined all the Measures which
<HI>Alderman Traffick</HI> had laid for making this
Partnership EFFECTUAL; and this was
to bring a MOB and make a Tumult
round about the Court; These <HI>old Scheme</HI>
had prepared for his Attendants, consist∣ing
of <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI>'s Servants and De∣pendants,
tho' their Master was with∣drawn,
as before, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Cloth-workers,
Dyers, Packers, Calenders, Setters, Hot∣pressers,
<HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> FACT-ORS, with
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
their Apprentices. Porters, Carmen, and
whatever Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and <HI>Scheme</HI> by their
mighty Interest could get together. These
raised a Hubbub without the Court,
crying out, no Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> no <HI>Tariff;</HI>
send away Count <HI>Tariff!</HI> Let the <HI>Dutch</HI>
or the Devil have Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> too, we care not; no
TARIFF, no TARIFF; likewise all the
while the Court were considering of the
Case, and preparing to give their Opi∣nion,
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and <HI>old Scheme,</HI> who had
now no other Game to play, and were
at their Wits end, interrupted them with
a hideous Noise and Clamour; crying no
<HI>Tariff,</HI> no <HI>Tariff;</HI> nay, some it seems cryed,
no <HI>Trade,</HI> no <HI>Tariff.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>as Noise generally does in the like
Cases,</HI> was said to have influenced many,
whether it intimidated any or no, History
is silent as to that; but Sir <HI>Pol</HI> saw evi∣dently,
that it had turned the Scale very
much on his Side: At length a certain
<HI>Suffolk Gentleman</HI> then in Court, desired
leave to offer an Expedient to appease
the present Tumult, and satisfy all Parties;
which having been granted, he began to
speak He acknowledged, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>That</HI> he had
been as forward as any for the <HI>Count</HI>'s co∣ming
over; he said, <HI>that</HI> he was still of the
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
Opinion, that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was capable
of laying a good Foundation for the In∣terest
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and <HI>that</HI> he ab∣horred
the Tricks and Forgeries of Sir
<HI>Pol,</HI> and his Sham-Evidence <HI>Old Scheme,</HI>
as much as any one did; <HI>that</HI> he had
given his Assistance in drawing the
Partnership now in Debate, and did
think the Articles of it were a sufficient
Ground to establish the Commerce of
the Nation upon: <HI>But that,</HI> in regard
the Noise was so great, and the Cla∣mour
without doors so loud, <HI>that</HI> nei∣ther
the Count nor his Witnesses could
be heard; and that the Term being now
expiring, <HI>the Court</HI> could not sit long
enough to determine a thing of so great
Consequence; he proposed therefore <HI>that</HI>
Persons might be chosen on both sides,
and appointed <HI>to adjust such Matters as were
not fully settled,</HI> and to <HI>explain the several
Meanings</HI> of both sides; so that <HI>an entire
Scheme of the Trade,</HI> which Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
proposed, <HI>might be framed, which might
fully answer the good Intentions of the
LANDLADY for the Good and Welfare
of her Tenants:</HI> And that to this pur∣pose,
the Debate about confirming the
Articles of the Partnership with Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> and making the same EFFEC∣TUAL,
<PB N="76" REF="75"/>
might be delayed for the pre∣sent,
to be reassumed the first Cause
next <HI>Michaelmas-Term,</HI> and then to be
fully discussed, try'd and determined,
by a Jury of <HI>Landed-Men,</HI> to be retur∣ned
by all the High Sheriffs of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI>
and that in the mean time Di∣rection
might be given, that the Court
might be imposed upon by no more
Counterfeits, no more Goodman FACTS,
but that the true Merchant FACT of
<HI>London</HI> might be found out, and desired
to appear; to whom all due Respect,
Honour and Regard, should be shewn
by the Court.'</Q></P>
<P>This, after some Debate, being put to
the Question, and carry'd by a Majority
of nine Voices, the Cause was put off
accordingly.</P>
<P>As soon as Mynheer <HI>Van Coopmanschap,</HI>
who lay all this while concealed at a cer∣tain
Lawyer's Chamber in the <HI>Temple,</HI>
had an Account of this Success, he came
down to the Club with great Joy, having
first, by Advice of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and other Mem∣bers
of his Acquaintance, sent several
Loads of Fagots to <HI>Basinghall-street, Spittle∣fields,
Ludgate-bill,</HI> and other convenient
Places, to make Bonfires and please their
Mob.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76"/>
Being come into the Club, <Q REND="inline">'he return'd
them his hearty Thanks for the great
Service they had done him, which he
assured them he would endeavour to re∣turn,
upon all occasions; if they should
have any need of him, whether upon
falling out with their LANDLADY,
or in whatever Business, they should re∣quire
his Assistance.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>He told them,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'He hop'd they would
continue the same Care for his Affairs,
against the next Term; and especially,
to provide good Advocates to plead for
him: He likewise told them, he doubted
not but he should renew his Partner∣ship
with Count <HI>Tariff</HI> the next Morn∣ing,
for he was a Person that could not
be out of Business:'</Q> And so making a
<HI>very low Bow,</HI> he offered to take his Leave.</P>
<P>But Sir <HI>Pol</HI> making a Sign to him to
stay, stood up, and spoke to him to the
following Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>He told him,</HI> <Q REND="inline"><P>The Society was very
glad they had been serviceable to him
in this Affair; that they were well sa∣tisfied
that he should enter into the
Partnership with Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> as he
desired, tho' thereby he should engross
all the Trade to himself; that they
would not fail to use their Interest, to
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
get him good Lawyers to plead for him
against next Term; and particularly he
told him, that they would use their
Endeavours to get the High Sheriffs to
return him a good Jury, who should
be as willing to give up the Trade of
the Kingdom to him as the Club had
been; which, he said, required a great
deal of Art and good Management on
their part to bring to pass.</P>
<P><HI>He put him in mind however,</HI> That the
Club had pawn'd their Credit with
<HI>Harry Wool-pack</HI> and his Friends in the
Country, and with all the Mob that
they had gotten together to make a
Noise for him: that he (<HI>Mynheer</HI>) and
his Partners in <HI>Holland,</HI> would take off
all their Woollen Manufactures and Fish;
and, that they should have no Loss by
their refusing the Partnership with
Count <HI>Tariff:</HI> which if <HI>I</HI> had not done,
<HI>says Sir Pol,</HI> and my good Friend here
Mr. SCHEME, you had had no Ap∣pearance
for you to day, and had cer∣tainly
lost your Point: And therefore
<HI>Mynheer,</HI> said Sir <HI>Pol</HI> we hope you will
be as good as your Word, and keep up
our Credit with the Country, without
which we shall never be able to get
you a good Jury chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="78"/>
<HI>Mynheer</HI> chang'd the Air of his Coun∣tenance
upon this Proposal, and told
them <HI>coldly,</HI> he would do them what
Service he could; but that as to the
Fish-Trade, it was out of his way to
buy any in <HI>Britain,</HI> he having Ships of
his own with which he could catch them
on our <HI>North-coasts</HI> sooner than we did
our selves.</P>
<P>But as to our Woollen Manufactures,
he said he would take a pretty large
Quantity of <HI>Glocestershire-cloths</HI> and <HI>Exe∣ter-serges;</HI>
only he said he must have
the Cloths WHITE, and the Serges
in the GREASE, because the Dying,
Dressing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was to be done in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
that his own poor Servants might
be employed.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Having said thus, he withdrew; and
the next Morning having enter'd into a
Parnership with Count <HI>Tariff, for one
Year certain,</HI> they went away together for
<HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where, as we are informed,
they drive a very great Trade; and Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> in particular, has already bought
a very great Quantity of <HI>East-India</HI> Goods
of him, with 20000 Hogsheads of <HI>Guel∣derland</HI>
Tobacco, and other Goods in pro∣portion.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79"/>
The Club being thus disappointed, ap∣peared
very much dejected; and we hear
that <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> and his Friends are
gone home into the Country, in a Fret,
disoblig'd and dissatisfied; as they might
very well be, their Manufactures being
thrown back upon their hands by the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> now his own Ends were ser∣ved.</P>
<P>Mynheer <HI>Van Coopmanschap</HI> being gone,
and Count <HI>Tariff</HI> also, the Chair-man
thought fit to appoint, that the Com∣mittee
should meet every Evening to
concert Measures for the carrying on the
Interest of <HI>Mynheer,</HI> according to their
Promise; and to oppose every one that
in the least countenanced the Partnership
with Alderman <HI>Traffick:</HI> And to the end
that this might be done more effectually,
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> proposed, that they should send
for their Scots Pamphleteer, who had for∣merly
done them very good Service in
frequent publishing their Scandals, and
who being lately fled from Justice, had
been entertained in <HI>Coopmanschap</HI>'s Family
abroad. This was no sooner agreed to,
but the Fugitive appeared in the Club,
having been lurking about the Town for
some time; and was set immediately to
work to write Pamphlets in Favour of
Mynheer <HI>Coopmanschap.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="80"/>
It cannot be expected we can collect all
the scurrilous Invectives which History has
given an Account of, that were written up∣on
this Occasion, as well against Count
<HI>Tariff,</HI> as against the LANDLADY her
self; the first were especially directed to re∣concile
the People to the breaking off the
Partnership between Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> and to inflame <HI>Harry
Wooll-pack</HI> again; so that instead of being
sensible of his Loss, and the Injury done
to his Trade, he should like well to have
all the Business go through old <HI>Coopman∣schap</HI>'s
Hands, and himself be a <HI>Jack-hold-my-staff</HI>
to the <HI>Dutch-man.</HI></P>
<P>This was the more difficult for them
to effect, because <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> had
been so ill used by <HI>Mynheer,</HI> and had
seen so much of his Knavery in the <HI>late
Tryal;</HI> especially when the pretended Mer∣chant
FACT's false Beard <HI>dropt off,</HI> and
discover'd him to be no FACT, but meer
<HI>Sir Pol Falshood,</HI> disguised in the Habit of
the true Merchant FACT; that he
was gone down in the Country disgusted,
and had openly said, they were a Pack
of Knaves; and, that he would never
have any more to do with them; that
they were in a Confederacy with <HI>Old
Coopmanschap,</HI> to enrich him at the Ex∣pence
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
of their Country, and to let him
make a Monopoly of the English Trade.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Pol</HI> was not ignorant, that it was abso∣lutely
necessary, in order to prevent their pre∣sent
Design, that they should bring over this
<HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> again; and to this end,
they were to set all their Engines at work
to blow Dust into his Eyes, that he should
not see too far into their Measures. The
Methods they took for this, as is said be∣fore,
are too many to be inserted in this
place; but the Histories of those Times
cannot fail to supply the Want. It may
suffice to let the Reader know, that this
was diligently endeavoured by charging
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> with the Breach of a
Partnership he had been engaged in with
<HI>Don Sebastian,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchant, and
with threatning what a great Damage it
would be to <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> if <HI>Don Se∣bastian</HI>
should take the Pett, and refuse to
Trade with him and his Friends; altho'
it was well known that <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> had
no other Market for his own Goods, nor
could he be supplied any other way with
such Goods as <HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> Traded
in; and besides all that, <HI>Don Sebastian</HI>
was so Embarrassed, with reference to
a neighbouring Merchant, who de∣manded
great Arrears from him, of an
<PB N="83" REF="82"/>
old Contract that was between them,
which amounted to more than the said
<HI>Don Sebastian</HI> was able to pay; that he
was fain to make use of Alderman <HI>Traf∣fick,</HI>
and his Interest, to prevent a very
great Suit at <HI>Law</HI> being commenc'd against
him; and it was very improbable that he
would do any thing so very affronting to
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> as what these Men
talked of, at the same time that he was
so much obliged to him other ways.</P>
<P>On the other hand, <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> saw
that there was so much Necessity for
what Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> had done, with
respect to some Particulars of their Part∣nership,
that he appeared very well sa∣tisfied
therewith, and did not pretend to
take any Step that look'd as if there was
any Unkindness between them: So that
all the Clamour on that side ceased, and
<HI>Don Sebastian</HI> very freely offered to renew
his Partnership with Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>
upon Terms of Friendship, and good
Correspondence, and to Trade together
as much as ever they did. On the other
hand, Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> espoused the In∣terest
of <HI>Don Sebastian</HI> so heartily and so
effectually, being made Arbitrator between
him and his Neighbour <HI>Don Philippo</HI> the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant, that he got that Breach
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
amicably made up, and a chargeable Suit
at Law, which he was threatned with,
effectually prevented.</P>
<P>This was such a piece of Service to
<HI>Don Sebastian,</HI> and he being a Person of
great Honour and Gratitude, was made
so sensible of it, that it prevented all
manner of Misunderstanding between
him and Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> to the great
Mortification of Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Friends,
who had made a mighty great Noise of
this Business.</P>
<P>Being disappointed in their Measures
in this Particular, and not able to bring
over <HI>Harry Wooll-pack,</HI> as they designed to
do, to their Party; the next thing they
went about was, to see what they were
able to do as to getting a pack'd Jury
against Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s Tryal came on.</P>
<P>Writing Pamphlets, and filling the
Country with most abominable Untruths,
Scandal, Slander, and false Rumours, to
make the People uneasy, this was their
stated never-failing Method; but the
main Point was, to bring the Character
of Count <HI>Tariff</HI> into Contempt; to which
nothing was wanting, that could possibly
be done by Men who neither valued their
own Reputation, or any Man's else; nay,
even the LANDLADY her self was in
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
a most unchristian manner insulted by
their Writers, and treated with the great∣est
Indecency imaginable, although they
knew her to be the best of Landladies,
and though they enjoyed their Shops with
the utmost Quiet under her, paying as
little Rent as could be expected; and
although she had successfully protected
them against all those who would have
disturbed them.</P>
<P>Whenever these Pamphleteers had
printed any thing that treated their said
LANDLADY either disrespectfully or
injuriously, or that insulted her in the
Government of her own Affairs; the
Club industriously conveyed those Prints
throughout the whole Kingdom, and
spread them among all her Tenants and
Servants, in order to accustom and inure
them to treat her in the same manner.</P>
<P>As to her immediate Servants, they were
treated by these People in the most scan∣dalous
manner imaginable; and upon all
Occasions so scurrilously and injuriously
used in their ordinary Business, and in the
Discharge of their Duty to their <HI>Landlady</HI>
and <HI>Mistress,</HI> that it look'd not only as if
these Men had a Right superior even to
their <HI>Landlady</HI> her self, but that she
was not lawfully Lady of the Manour,
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
or were not rightful Possessor of the Te∣nements
which she had let to them.</P>
<P>This they thought was useful to awe
and brow-beat those good Country Peo∣ple
whose proper Business it was to bring
the Names of those Gentlemen to the
High Sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who were to return
the Jury by whom Count <HI>Tariff</HI> was to
be tryed.</P>
<P>But this had a quite contrary Effect;
for when the Country Tenants, especially
<HI>Harry Wooll-pack</HI> and his People, came to
see how their good <HI>Landlady</HI> was served,
for whom they had an unseigned Zeal
and Affection; and upon what Account,
and with what little Reason she was so
unmannerly and undutifully handled, it
raised their Passions to the highest degree,
and they resolved to have nothing to do
with Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his Party.</P>
<P>This also had a good effect the other
way; for, it discovered the Designs of
Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and his CLUB, and it gave the
People Warning against being farther im∣posed
upon; by which means there ap∣pears
a general good Disposition among
them all, to choose such a Jury as shall
hear the Cause of Count <HI>Tariff</HI> with Im∣partiality,
and that will not be bullied
by Sir <HI>Politick Falshood</HI> and his <HI>False-beard,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="86"/>
or be put off from doing Justice by the
Noise of his Rabble; so that there is no
Question but the Partnership between
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> and Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> will
be approved, and the Articles thereof,
upon a fair and full hearing of the Cause,
be made EFFECTUAL.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the aforesaid Memoirs were
written, we are given to under∣stand,
that there are divers Ac∣counts
come from abroad, of the great
Joy which the rejecting Count <HI>Tariff</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> had occasioned in <HI>France,</HI> espe∣cially
among the Manufacturers of Woollen
Goods in the several Provinces of <HI>Languedoc,
Pictou, Anjou,</HI> &amp;c. where upon the first
News of the Treaty of a Partnership be∣tween
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> and <HI>Harry Woollpack,</HI>
Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> and others in <HI>London,</HI>
the People were under the greatest Conster∣nation
imaginable; knowing that if that
<HI>Partnership</HI> went on, and should be made
EFFECTUAL by Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s
<HI>Landlady;</HI> and that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had come
off at his Tryal with that Applause which
they heard was expected, their several
Undertakings of Woollen Manufactures
in those Places would be ruined.</P>
<P>They had represented this before to
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> himself, humbly Addressing
<PB N="89" REF="88"/>
and Entreating him not to enter into
Partnership with Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> for
that it would be to the ruin of his own
Country if he did: They also applyed
themselves to their own <HI>Landlord,</HI> to try
if he could be prevailed upon to prevent
Count <HI>Tariff</HI> from entering into any En∣gagement
which would be so fatal to all
his Tenants.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Landlord</HI>'s Circumstances were
at that time such, that he could not con∣veniently
interpose in the Matter; for
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s <HI>Landlady,</HI> and he, had
newly ended a long and chargeable SUIT
at LAW, and being made Friends, he
was unwilling to Disoblige her, tho' he
complyed with Conditions, which at other
Times he would not have done; nor had
the Partnership with Count <HI>Tariff</HI> ever
been made upon such advantageous Terms,
if it had not been so.</P>
<P>Being thus repulsed by their <HI>Landlord,</HI>
the poor Manufacturers had no recourse
but to Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> entreating him not
to engage with Alderman <HI>Traffick,</HI> and
representing that it would be their utter
ruin, <HI>if they did;</HI> that they should never
get any WOOLL to go on with their
Manufactures, and without which it was
impossible for them to carry on their
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
Trade: They knew, <HI>they said,</HI> that Al∣derman
<HI>Traffick,</HI> and his Partner <HI>Harry
Woollpack,</HI> were utter Enemies to them
and to their Employment, and would
Effectually put a stop to their having any
Wooll from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> with∣out
which they should be all undone;
whereas those People who had managed
the Trade in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> formerly, were
very easie in that Affair, and at least
were slack in preventing the Exportation
of their Wooll; so that they could get over
whatever Quantity they had occasion
for.</P>
<P>They farther represented to him, that
if he went on with this Partnership, it
would bring in such a prodigious Quan∣tity
of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> from <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
upon them; and that so much bet∣ter
than any they could make at home,
that no one would buy their Goods made
in <HI>France:</HI> As to the high Duties which
they were informed he would take off,
they represented, that the <HI>English</HI> Manu∣factures
would not only be better than
theirs, but would thereby be <HI>cheaper also;</HI> for
that notwithstanding their People worked
as cheap, and fared as hard as any Peo∣ple
in the World, yet they were but
young, and unexperienced in the Trade,
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
and had not the Arts of doing every
thing so at first hand, as the <HI>English:</HI> Nor
had they Materials as the <HI>English</HI> had,
but at very remote distances, and upon
much dearer Terms than the <HI>English</HI> had;
so that AS it had been impossible for them
to set up their several Manufactures, if
it had not been for Count <HI>Tariff</HI>'s break∣ing
off his former Partnerships in <HI>Britain,</HI>
in the Years 1667, 1687, and 1701, by
which the Markets were their own, and
they were admitted to sell at what Price
they pleased; SO it would be impossible
for them to go on with any Success, if he
should renew his said Business; and en∣gage
anew with the said <HI>Traffick</HI> and
<HI>Woollpack,</HI> who were sworn Enemies to
their Trade.</P>
<P>These Representations, however im∣portunate,
and made by vast Numbers
of the said <HI>Count</HI>'s Tenants and Servants,
yet could not prevail with the <HI>Count</HI> at
all; especially when Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI>'s
<HI>Landlady</HI> interposed her good Offices to
have the Partnership agreed on; <HI>so that</HI>
as you have heard the Affair went on
successfully, and the Partnership was con∣cluded;
only that it wanted some Ratifi∣cations
to make the same EFFECTUAL
among <HI>Harry Woollpack</HI>'s Friends, and
others, as has been shewn.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91"/>
The poor Manufacturers being thus re∣pulsed,
were driven even to Despair, and
had no remedy but Prayers and Tears,
for they are not such noisie Fellows as
our Sir <HI>Pol</HI> and old <HI>Scheme</HI> brought along
with them to the Parliament: They dare
not come up with their Mob at their heels,
and interrupt the Assembly and Parlia∣ments
of their Country, with their Cla∣mours
and Cries of <HI>no Tariff!</HI> no <HI>Tariff!</HI>
no <HI>English Partnership!</HI> and the like; but
seeing the same like to go on, they sat down
with a profound Submission to their <HI>Land∣lord,</HI>
but at the same time crying uni∣versally
to one another, that they were all
undone, and their Trade ruined.</P>
<P>As their Grief was inexpressible at the
prospect of the opening of the <HI>English</HI>
Commerce into <HI>France,</HI> so when they
understood how things were like to go
in <HI>England,</HI> they began to revive in
their Hopes; and having their trusty
Agents in the Club in self, at <HI>London,</HI>
by whom they had Intelligence every
Post, how things went on, those
Agents did not fail to push forwards Sir
<HI>Pol</HI> and the <HI>Club,</HI> to insult Count <HI>Tariff</HI>
as much as possible, and in order to this,
they scattered about private Papers, sig∣nifying,
that Count <HI>Tariff</HI> had little or
<PB N="93" REF="92"/>
no Influence on the Woollen Manufa∣ctures
in his own Country; that they
were now come to that Perfection, that
they valued <HI>no English</HI> Manufactures <HI>at
all,</HI> but made them better at home;
and were able not only to supply them∣selves,
but all the World, and even <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
it self.</P>
<P>These were the Men that put it into
Sir <HI>Pol</HI>'s Head, to impose a distracted
Notion upon the Club, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
there was a Project set up in <HI>France</HI> to
make Woollen Manufactures without
WOOLL at all; and thus they help'd
blow the Coals up in the Club against
Count <HI>Tariff;</HI> when, at the same time,
they in <HI>France</HI> were in the utmost Con∣sternation,
for fear his Articles with
Alderman <HI>Traffick</HI> should be made EF∣FECTUAL.</P>
<P>But
it is impossible to express the Joy
of the poor People, all over the afore∣said
Provinces, where the Woollen Ma∣nufactures
are made, when their Agents
in the Club wrote them the following
Letter, which being written in <HI>French,</HI>
we thought fit to Translate for the be∣nefit
of the Publick.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Messieurs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE do our selves the Honour to
acquaint you, that we are just
now returned from the Assembly of
Estates of this Country, where the Case
of Count <HI>Tariff,</HI> and his new Partner∣ship,
was brought to a Tryal; we have
been assisting in the Club of the City-Malecontents,
<HI>and others,</HI> in raising an
hideous outcry in the Streets and outer
Courts of the Parliament, where we
met with a great Number of their
Canaille to say, <HI>no Tariff! no Tariff!</HI> which
has had the desired Success; for the
Court has refused to make the said
Partnership EFFECTUAL; and have
put off the Cause till the next Meeting:
So, <HI>Messieurs,</HI> you are secure of enjoying
your Manufactures for one whole Year
longer; and that you may carry them
on the more successfully, we have, ac∣cording
to your Order, bought you a
large parcel of fine Wooll, to be ready,
as usual, when your Boats shall come for
it; which, with what we formerly
Shipp'd off from <HI>Ireland,</HI> will be of
great Service to you.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your most Obedient Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></SIGNED><POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
<P>P. S. The Club are very well satisfied,
that you should have what Wooll can be
conveyed away; tho' <HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Wooll∣pack</HI>
had Proposals ready for the pre∣venting
it, if their Partnership had
gone forward—</P>

<DATELINE>London, <DATE>August 3. 1713.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This News occasioned such a Universal
Joy thro' all that Country, that nothing
could exceed it, except the Extravancies
of the Club and their Agents in <HI>Britain,</HI>
tho' History has not yet let us know how
their Friends reconciled it to Reason, that
both the <HI>French</HI> could rejoyce, and they
also, upon the same Occasion; perhaps
Time may assist us to unfold the Mystery.</P>
