<HEAD>Farther THOUGHTS
ON
TAR-WATER.</HEAD>
<P>AS the many Experiments that are daily made
of the Virtues of Tar-Water, furnish new
Discoveries and Reflexions, some of these I have
thrown together, and offer to the Public in hopes
they may prove useful.</P>
<P>It is a frequent Complaint, that Tar-Water is
made of bad Tar, being of a reddish Colour, sweetish
or disagreeably insipid. But though the Dregs of
Tar are often foul, and make foul Tar-Water, and
though Tar already used is often made use of by un∣fair
Dealers a second, if not a third Time, which
produceth a vile Potion, void of the genuine Flavour
and Virtue of Tar-Water. Yet I apprehend these
Defects may sometimes be ascribed, rather to the
Vessel wherein the Tar-Water is made, than to the
Tar itself.</P>
<P>Tar-Water being made in an earthen Vessel un∣glazed,
or that hath lost Part of its Glazing, may
extract (as it is a strong Menstruum) from the Clay,
a fade Sweetishness, offensive to the Palate. It should
seem therefore that the best Way of making Tar-Water
is in a Stone Jug, or earthen Vessel through∣out
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
well glazed, and, as it will not fail to extract a
Tincture from any metallic Vessel, it should be
warmed in a well glazed Pipkin, rather than a
Sauce-pan.</P>
<P>By increasing the Proportion of Tar to the Water,
and by stirring it longer, Tar-Water may be made
strong enough for a Spoonful to impregnate a large
Glass, a Thing very useful on a Road.</P>
<P>Those who in chronical Disorders, or as a Pre∣servative,
have for a long time drunk Tar-Water,
must in acute Cases drink the more.</P>
<P>Tar-Water must be drunk warm in Agues, Small-pox,
Measles and Fevers, in Colics and Disorders
of the Bowels, in Gout also, and Rheumatism, in
most other Ailments cold or warm, at the Choice of
the Patient.</P>
<P>In Fevers the Patient cannot begin too soon, or
drink too much. By undoubted Experience it is
found to cool the hot, and warm the cold, and to be
a most successful Medicine in Fevers, notwithstand∣ing
its great Virtue in Palsies and Dropsies.</P>
<P>When not long since an Inflammation attacked
the Throat, Breast, and Lungs of Children, and
became general in my Neighbourhood, Numbers
were recovered by the Use of Tar-Water, nor did
I hear that any miscarried who used it, though many
perished who did not.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Medicine less proper and efficacious in
old Age. At the same time that this inflammatory
Distemper raged among the Children, a Woman in
her sixty-eighth Year, from violent Cold was seized
at once with Ague, Colic, and Jaundice, of all
which Maladies she was cured in a Fortnight, by
drinking three Pints of warm Tar-water every Day.
Numberless such Instances daily occur, which shew
it to be a safe and efficacious Medicine both for old
and young.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Evacuations by Sweat, which usually render Pa∣tients
very weak and dispirited, have not the same
bad Effects when produced by Tar-Water, which
I have frequently known to give high Spirits in all
the Stages of a Fever, and under the lowest Regi∣men,
therefore old People and weak Persons, who
cannot well bear common Evacuations, are best
cured by Tar-Water, which in some Sort seemeth
to renew those who are worn out with Age and
Infirmities.</P>
<P>Tar-Water is of singular Use in strengthening the
Stomach and Bowels, and agrees particularly well
with Infants, taken either by themselves or by the
Nurse, and best by both. Though as it throws the
ill Humours out into the Surface of the Skin, it
may render them for a Time, perhaps, unseemly
with Eruptions, but withal healthy and lively. And
I will venture to say, that it lays in them the Prin∣ciples
of a good Constitution for the rest of their
Lives.</P>
<P>Nor is it only useful to the Bodies of Infants, it
hath also a good Effect on their Minds, as those who
drink it are observed to be remarkably forward and
sprightly. Even the most heavy, lumpish, and un∣promising
Infants, appear to be much improved
by it. A Child there is in my Neighbourhood, of
fine Parts, who at first seemed stupid and an Idiot,
but, by constant Use of Tar-Water, grew lively
and observing, and is now noted for Understand∣ing
beyond others of the same Age.</P>
<P>Infants are easily brought to take it by Spoon, and
even grow to a Liking of it, and as their Disorders
arise chiefly from Indigestion, they receive the great∣est
Benefit from a Medicine so well calculated to
strengthen the Intestines, and preserve them from
Fits. In a word, if it were the common Practice
to accustom Infants from the Beginning to take Tar-Water,
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
this would greatly conduce to the Health
both of their Minds and Bodies. There is, I am
verily persuaded, no one Thing in the power of
Art or Nature, that would so generally and effectually
contribute to repair the Constitutions of our Gentry
and Nobility, by strengthning the Children, and
casting off in their Infancy those Impurities and
Taints, which they often bring into the World.</P>
<P>An Infant may take one Quarter of a Pint in the
Day, warm, by Spoonfuls; less may do good, and
there is no fear of Excess. When I consider the
private Woe of Families, as well as the public
Loss occasioned by the Death of such an incredible
Number of Infants, under two Years of Age, I
cannot but insist on recommending Tar-Water, both
as a Remedy and Preservative in that tender Age,
which cannot bear the common Treatment and
Methods of Physic, or with safety take those Drugs
which are fitter for grown Persons.</P>
<P>Another Reason which recommends Tar-Water,
particularly to Infants and Children, is the great
Security it brings against the Small-pox, to those
that drink it, who are observed, either never to
take that Distemper, or to have it in the gentlest
Manner.</P>
<P>There is no Distemper more contagious and de∣structive
than the Small-pox, or more generally
dreaded, attended with worse Symptoms, or that
leaves behind it worse Effects; I observe at the
same time, that Tar-Water is in no other Case a
more safe and sure Remedy than in this; of which
Captain <HI>Drape</HI>'s Certificate, sworn to before the
Mayor of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> in the presence of several
principal Persons of that Town, is a most evident
Proof.</P>
<P>That one hundred and seventy Persons, seized at
once with the Small-pox, deprived of all Conve∣niencies,
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
and in the worst Circumstances of a nar∣row
Ship and hot Climate, should all recover by
the single Medicine of Tar-Water, except one who
would not drink it, is a matter of Fact, so plain
and convincing, and so well attested, as to leave no
Doubt in Minds free from Prepossession, about the
Usefulness and Efficacy of Tar-Water in the Small-pox;
a Point I had been before sufficiently convinced
of, by many Instances in my own Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It hath been surmised by some celebrated Phy∣sicians,
that one Day a Specific may be discovered
for the peculiar Venom of the Small-pox. There
seems to be some Reason for thinking that Tar-Water
is such a Specific. I say this on good Grounds,
having by many Experiments observed its Virtue
in curing, as well as in preventing, that cruel Dis∣temper;
during the whole Course of which, it is to
be drank warm; a moderate Glass (about Half a
Pint) every Hour, in common Cases, may suffice,
in bad Cases more may be given; there is no Fear
of Excess.</P>
<P>Those who endeavour to discredit this cooling
Cordial, and salutary Medicine, as an Inflamer of
the Blood, do very consistently decry its Use in the
Small-pox; but there can be nothing more clear,
full, and satisfactory than Captain <HI>Drape</HI>'s Affida∣vit,
to convince reasonable People of the great and
surprising Efficacy of Tar-Water, in the Cure of
the Small-pox; and consequently of the ground∣lesness
of that Report, which ascribes a heating or
inflaming Quality to it. And yet that groundless
Report hath hindred many from reaping the Benefit
they might otherwise have done, from the Use of
this Water, which is of excellent Virtue in all kinds
of inflammatory Disorders, Fevers, Quinsies, Pleu∣risies,
and such like of the hot and inflamed Kind,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
whereof the Public as well as myself have known a
Multitude of Examples.</P>
<P>I ask whether the Fact sworn before the Magi∣strates
of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> be not a sufficient Answer to
all that is objected, from an inflaming Quality, to
Tar-Water. Can any Instance be produced in the
whole <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> or History of Physic, of
the Virtue of a Medicine tried on greater Numbers,
or under greater Disadvantages, or with greater
Success, or more credibly attested. I wish for
the common Good of Mankind, that the same Ex∣periment
was tried in our Hospitals. Probably
the World would soon be relieved from that great
and general Terror of the Small-pox.</P>
<P>When I hear of the Devastations made by this
Distemper, in great Cities and populous Towns,
how many Lives are lost, or (as may be said) thrown
away, which might have been in all likelihood easily
preserved, by the Use of a Medicine, so cheap and
obvious, and in eyery one's power, it seems Matter
of great Concern and Astonishment, and leaves one
at a loss to guess at the Motives, that govern hu∣man
Actions in Affairs of the greatest moment.
The Experiment may be easily made, if an equal
Number of poor Patients in the Small-pox, were put
into two Hospitals at the same Time of the Year,
and provided with the same Necessaries of Diet and
Lodging, and, for further Care, let the one have a
Tub of Tar-Water and an old Woman; the other
Hospital, what Attendance and Drugs you please.</P>
<P>In all obstinate Sores and Ulcers, I very much re∣commend
the drinking of Tar-Water, and washing
them with a strong Lotion of it, will hasten the
Cure.</P>
<P>One of the most painful and dangerous Cases is
that of a Woman's fore Breast. How many poor
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Creatures after long languishing in Misery, are
obliged to suffer the most severe chirurgical Opera∣tions,
often the cutting off the entire Breast? The
Use of Tar-Water in those Cases hath been attended
with such Success, that I do earnestly recommend
the drinking thereof, both as a Cure and Preserva∣tive,
as a most effectual Medicine to remove the
shooting Pains that precede a Cancer, and also to
cure the Cancer itself, without Amputation. Can∣cerous
and sore Breasts are such cruel Cases, occa∣sioned
by so many internal Causes, as well as out∣ward
Accidents, that it is a necessary Piece of Hu∣manity,
to contribute all we can to the Prevention
and Cure thereof.</P>
<P>In the King's Evil, Leprosy, and foulest Cases,
Tar-Water cannot be too much recommended. The
poor Vagabonds of <HI>Ireland,</HI> are many of them in∣fected
and eaten up with the foul Disease, which
with them passeth for a Canker, as they call it.
Several Instances of extraordinary Cures have been
performed on such Persons, by drinking Tar-Water
copiously, for some Weeks or Months together,
without Confinement or other Restraint, than that
of a regular cool Diet. It is indeed a Specific, both
for this and all other Taints and Impurities of the
Blood.</P>
<P>An Extract of <HI>Siris</HI> was made, and Accounts of
the Effects of Tar-Water were reprinted in <HI>America,</HI>
in which Continent, as well as in the Islands, much
Use hath been made thereof, particularly by those
who possess great Numbers of Slaves: Of this I have
been informed by Letters, and by Word of Mouth,
from Persons belonging to those Parts, who have
assured me of the extensive and successful Use of
this Medicine in many Cases, and more especially
in the most inveterate Kinds of the soul Disease.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
I need not say how dearly they purchase Health
who obtain it by Salivation, and yet long and se∣vere
as that Course is, it is often unsuccessful. There
are Instances of such as having passed through it
with much Misery and Patience, have been after∣wards
cured by the simple Use of Tar-Water.</P>
<P>The King's Evil, so lothsom in its Symptoms
and Effects, and withal so difficult, if at all possible,
to cure by any other Method, is most surely and
easily cured by the Tar-Water, even when the Pa∣tient
is far gone, even when he derives it from his
Ancestors. A Quart <HI>per diem</HI> for a few Months,
I have known to cure the most deplorable and
abandoned Cases.</P>
<P>How many wealthy Families, otherwise at their
Ease, are corrupted with this Taint in their Blood?
How many want Heirs and Husbands, through this
odious Malady? A Specific for this Disease alone,
would be justly esteemed a most valuable Secret, and
the plenty and cheapness of the Medicine ought not
in Reason to make it less esteemed.</P>
<P>Salivating, Bleeding, and Purging, are attended
with great Hardships and Inconveniencies (even
where the Patient recovers) reducing the Strength
and Spirits of those who use them, whereas Tar-Water
greatly adds to both.</P>
<P>In Fractures and Wounds, a Quart or two drank
daily, while the Patient is under Cure, doth very
much assuage the Pain and promote his Recovery,
both as by its balsamic Nature it disposeth the Parts
to heal, and also as it lessens if not totally prevents
the Fever.</P>
<P>A poor Boy in <HI>Cloyne,</HI> having fallen from a
Tree, broke both Arm and Wrist. This Accident
was concealed or neglected for two or three Weeks;
he was then put under the Care of a skilful Bone∣setter,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
who finding the Bones knit and grown
crooked, and that it would be necessary to break
them again, in order to set them right, and withal
considering the hot Season of the Year (in <HI>July</HI>) he
apprehended his Patient's being thrown into a Fe∣ver
that might prove fatal. But the Boy being
made to drink copiously of Tar-Water, this pre∣vented
or lessened the Fever in such sort, that the
Bones were broke and set again, and the Cure pro∣ceded
as easily and speedily as Could be wished.</P>
<P>I have known several Instances of Bruises and
Wounds cured by Tar-Water. A Person in my
Neighbourhood ran over by a Horse was much
bruised, and cured only by drinking Tar-Water.
Another knocked down with a Mallet, thereupon
thrown into a violent Fever, and given for dead;
another wounded with an Axe, so that his Life was
thought in danger, were both recovered by the Use
of Tar-Water; which, as it is sovereign against
Gangrenes and Fevers, hath great Success in all
Sorts of Wounds, Contusions, and Fractures, being
taken throughout the whole chirurgical Process,
along with whatsoever other Methods or Remedies
are applied.</P>
<P>Tar-Water operates variously. In Dropsies and
Bruises it hath been known to work by purging.
The stronger Kind being used as a Wash, is good
against ulcerous Eruptions. But in all Cases where
the Lotion is used, I believe the drinking of Tar-Water
might alone suffice, albeit the Sores may be
longer withering and drying away.</P>
<P>There is a certain Age or Time of Life, when the
female Sex runs no small Risk from the ceasing of
their natural Evacuations. In this Case Tar-Water
is a good Preservative, purifying the Blood, and
clearing it from that cancerous Tendency, which it
is sometimes subject to, about that time. I take it
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
to be a Specific in all cancerous Cases, even the
bleeding Cancer, esteemed incurable by Physicians,
hath been cured by Tar-Water.</P>
<P>In Diseases peculiar to Women it is of no small
Use. Several who had suffered much by Accidents
in Child-bearing, have found themselves relieved by
Tar-Water. In all Sorts of Tumours, Wens, and
praeternatural Excrescences, it hath been found an
excellent Remedy.</P>
<P>Many dangerous Symptoms, and even sudden
Death are often owing to a Polypus, in some or
other of the Vessels, through which the Blood cir∣culates,
than which it seems there is no inward Cause
of Death or Disease more to be dreaded and guard∣ed
against; how many drop down dead in our
Streets, or at Table, or in the midst of Business or
Diversions? how many are found dead in their Beds?</P>
<P>Tremors, Palpitations of the Heart, irregular
Pulses, Apoplexies, sudden Deaths, often proceed
from a slow, stagnating, interrupted Motion, or
stoppage of the Blood, in its Circulation through
the Body; and there seemeth to be no Cause so cer∣tainly
productive of obstructed Circulation, as the
Polypus, a Case, perhaps, much more frequent
than is commonly imagined. <HI>Morgagni,</HI> the cele∣brated
Professor at <HI>Padua,</HI> and most eminent Ana∣tomist,
who was supposed to have dissected more
human Bodies than any Man living, assured me,
above thirty Years ago, that in the far greater Part
of such Bodies, he found Polypuses, if not in the
Ventricles of the Heart or larger Vessels, yet in
some other Vessel or Cavity; to which he attributes
many Disorders, and which he supposed to be form∣ed
by the obstructed Motion of the Blood. To
prevent this, he dissuaded from all tight Ligatures,
especially in Sleep, unbuttoning the Neck and
Wrist-bands of his Shirt every Night, a Practice he
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
had learned (as he said) from his Master, the famous
<HI>Malpighi.</HI></P>
<P>When the Circulation is once quite stopped, no∣thing
can restore it, which would be the same thing
as restoring a dead Man to Life, and in Proportion,
as the Circulation of the Blood is obstructed, the
Body is disordered. Total Obstruction is Death;
partial Obstruction is Disease. The Polypus there∣fore
is always hurtful, if not mortal. It is, indeed,
matter of serious Reflexion, that we may probably
carry about with us a Principle of Death, always
at work within, and of a Nature so violent and
sudden in its Effects, so hard to come at, and so
difficult to subdue.</P>
<P>It may well be thought at first View, a vain Un∣dertaking,
to attempt to dissolve a fleshy or mem∣branous
Substance, so latent and inaccessible, by
common Means or Medicines. But, as Tar-Water
hath been undoubtedly known to dissolve and dis∣perse
Wens, and other fleshy or membranous Tu∣mours,
in the outward Parts of the Body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Effects of Tar Water, Sect 228, and 229.</NOTE>, having
been drank and circulated with the Blood, it should
seem by a Parity of Reason, that it may also dis∣solve
and put an End to those Concretions that
are formed in the Ventricles of the Heart or Blood
Vessels, and so remove one great Cause of Apo∣plexies
and sudden Death; and what cures may
prevent. I have been the longer on this Subject,
for the sake of many who lead sickly Lives, as
well as several who are snatched away by untimely
Death.</P>
<P>Universally, in all Cases where other Methods
fail, I could wish this of Tar-Water was tried. It
hath been sometimes known, that the most inve∣terate
Head-aches, and other nervous Disorders,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
that would yield to no other Medicine, have been
cured by a Course of Tar-Water, regularly and con∣stantly
pursued.</P>
<P>Wheresoever pure Blood or Plenty of Spirits are
wanting, it may be concluded from manifold Ex∣perience,
that Tar-Water is of singular Benefit.
Several Persons have acknowledged themselves to be
much fitter to go through Business or Study from
the Use of it.</P>
<P>Nor is it only medicinal to human Kind: it is
also of no small use in the Curing of brute Ani∣mals.
It hath been tried on several Kinds, particu∣larly
with great Success in the late epidemical Dis∣temper
of our Horses. And I have been credibly
informed, that being drank in plenty, it hath re∣covered
even a glandered Horse, that was thought
incurable.</P>
<P>And as it is of such extensive use, both to Man
and Beast, it should seem, that a Tub of Tar-Wa∣ter
constantly supplied in a Market-Town, would
serve, in some sort, for an Hospital. Many other
Drugs are not easily got, this is every where plenty
and cheap; many are of a doubtful Nature, this of
known Innocence; others soon perish, this lasts
for Years, and is not the worse for keeping. This,
in short, is a Medicine for the common People,
being a safe and cheap Remedy; for such as cannot
afford to be long sick, or to make use of costly
Medicines.</P>
<P>A Patient who drinks Tar-Water, must not be
alarmed at Pustules or Eruptions in the Skin; these
are good Symptoms, and shew the Impurities of the
Blood to be cast out. It is also not amiss to observe,
that, as Tar-Water by its active Qualities, doth
stir the Humours, entering the minutest Capillaries,
and dislodging Obstructions, it may happen that
this working shall sometimes be felt in the Limbs,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
or discharge itself in a Fit of the Gout, which, how∣ever
disagreeable, proves salutary.</P>
<P>I am credibly informed of several strange Con∣veyances,
which Tar-Water hath found out, where∣by
to discharge Impurities from the human Con∣stitution.
A Person who had been in a bad state
of Health above twenty Years, upon a Course of
Tar-Water was thrown into a most extraordinary
Fit of an Ague, and from that time recovered a
good State of Health. An old Gentleman in the
County of <HI>Cork,</HI> who for a long time had been a
Valetudinarian, afflicted with many Infirmities, be∣ing
advised to drink Tar-Water, found himself re∣lieved,
but it produced and soon cured a Pthiriasis
or lousy Distemper, in which the putrid Humours
having discharged themselves, left him quite sound
and healthy.</P>
<P>In a Course of Tar-Water, if any Disorder hap∣pens
from some other Cause, as from Cold, from
the use of strong Liquors, from a Surfeit, or such
like Accident, it would not be fair to impute it
to Tar-Water; and yet this hath been sometimes
done.</P>
<P>The Effects of Vomiting occasioned by Tar-Water
are not to be apprehended. Some are dis∣couraged
from drinking because their Stomachs
cannot bear it. But when it takes a turn towards
working upwards, Nature, by that very way, hath
been often known to carry on the Cure. A worthy
Gentleman, Member of Parliament, came into my
Neighbourhood, in the Autumn of the Year 1750;
he was cachectic and extremely reduced, so that his
Friends thought him near his End. Upon his en∣tering
into a Course of Tar-Water, it produced a
prodigious Vomiting, which weakened him much
for the present; but persisting to continue the Use
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
thereof for about two Months, he was restored to
his Health, Strength and Spirits.</P>
<P>Tar-Water is very diuretic, thereby preventing
Stone and Gravel, and carrying off by Urine, those
Salts that might otherwise occasion Fevers, Rheu∣matisms,
Dropsies, Head-aches, and many other
Disorders, if retained in the Blood. Hence, some
have apprehended a Diabetes, from the continued
Use thereof, but it is so far from causing a Diabetes,
that it hath been known to cure that Disorder.</P>
<P>The Constitution of a Patient sometimes requireth
during a Course of Tar-Water, that he take Water
and Honey, also rosted Apples, stewed Prunes and
other Diet of an opening Kind. A Hint of this is
sufficient. If the Reader now and then meets with
some Remarks, contained in my former Writings
on this Subject, he may be pleased to consider, I
had rather repeat than forget what I think useful to
be known.</P>
<P>Some, endeavouring to discourage the Use of
Tar-Water in <HI>England,</HI> have given out that it may
indeed be serviceable in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where People live
on such low Diet as sour Milk and Potatoes, but it
cannot be of the same Service in <HI>England,</HI> where
Men are accustomed to a more liberal and hearty
Food; and indeed it must be owned, that the
Peasants in this Island, live but poorly, but no
People in <HI>Europe</HI> live better (in the Sense of Ea∣ting
and Drinking) than our Gentry and Citizens;
and from these the Instances of Cures by Tar-Water
have been chiefly taken. Those who would con∣fine
its Use to the moist Air and poor Diet of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> may be assured that all over <HI>Europe,</HI> in
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany, Italy, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI>
Tar-Water works the same Effect. In both <HI>North</HI>
and <HI>South,</HI> in <HI>West</HI> and <HI>East-Indies,</HI> it hath been
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
used and continues to be used with great Success.
It hath reached all our Colonies both on the Con∣tinent
and the Islands, and many Barrels of Tar-Water
have been sent from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to <HI>Batavia;</HI>
of all which I have had authentic Accounts. But
its Use is no where more conspicuous than at Sea,
in curing that Plague of sea-faring Persons, the
Scurvy, as was found in the late Attempt to discover
a north-west Passage; and (as I doubt not) will be
found as oft as it is tried. Every Ship in his Ma∣jesty's
Navy should always have a Vessel of Tar-Water
upon Deck, for the Use of the Sailors, both
in the Scurvy and other Maladies.</P>
<P>It is indeed a Medicine equally calculated for all
Climates, for Sea and Land, for rich and poor,
high and low Livers; being, as hath been else∣where
mentioned, a Cordial which doth not heat;
a peculiar Privilege this, and of excellent Use.
That it is a Cordial, is manifest from its cheering
and enlivening Quality, and that it is not heating,
is as manifest, from its singular Use in all Cases
where the Blood is inflamed. As this Medicine
imparts a genial friendly Warmth, suited to the
human Constitution, those who pass through a
Course of Tar-Water, would do well not to in∣crease
such friendly Warmth to an inflaming Heat,
by a wrong Regimen of high-seasoned Food and
strong Liquors, which are not wanted by the Drink∣ers
of Tar-Water. There is a certain Degree of
Heat necessary to the Well-being and Life of Man.
More than this will be uneasy, and this Uneasiness
indicates a proper Choice of Diet.</P>
<P>I have myself drank above a Gallon of Tar-Water
in a few Hours, and been cooled and re∣covered
from a Fever by it. So many Instances of
the same Nature I have known, as would make it
evident to any unprejudiced Person, that Tar-Water
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
is a cooling Medicine; of which Truth I
am as thoroughly convinced, as it is possible to be
of any Theorem in Physic or natural Science.</P>
<P>The Unsuccessfulness of other Methods, should
rather be an Encouragement than a Bar to the Trial
of Tar-Water. A young Lady, Daughter to a
worthy Gentleman near <HI>Cork,</HI> had been long af∣flicted
with a grievous Pain in her Side, and having
had the best Advice that could be got, was not
relieved until she drank Tar-Water, which quite
removed her Pain. Some time after she was again
seized with the same Disorder, but returning to the
Use of Tar-Water, she grew well and still con∣tinues
so.</P>
<P>A Woman turned out of the Infirmary at <HI>Cork,</HI>
as incurable, because she would not submit to the
cutting off her Leg, came to, <HI>Cloyne,</HI> where she
continued half a Year drinking Tar-Water, and
living upon Bread and Milk, by which Course she
recovered, and went to Service.</P>
<P>There is at present, while I am writing, a most
remarkable Case here at <HI>Cloyne,</HI> of a poor Soldier
in a Dropsy, whose Belly was swoln to a most im∣moderate
Size. He said he had been five Months
in an Hospital at <HI>Dublin,</HI> and having tried other
Methods in vain, left it to avoid being tapped. It
is a Fortnight since he came to <HI>Cloyne,</HI> during which
Time he hath drunk two Quarts of Tar-Water
every Day. His Belly is now quite reduced: his
Appetite and Sleep which were gone are restored:
he gathers Strength every Moment: and he who
was despaired of, seems to be quite out of Danger,
both to himself, and to all who see him. It is re∣markable,
that upon drinking the Tar-Water, he
voided several Worms of a very extraordinary Size.
This Medicine, which is observed to make some
Persons costive, is to hydropic Patients a strong
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
Purge. The present is but one of several Instances,
wherein the Dropsy hath been cured by Tar-Water;
which I never knew to fail in any Species of that
Malady.</P>
<P>I am very credibly informed, that an aged
Clergyman of <HI>Maidstone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> being reduced to
the last Extremity by the Gout in his Stomach, after
having tried strong Liquors, and the Methods
usual in that Case without Success, betook himself
to drink a vast Quantity of warm Tar-Water, still
replenishing and letting it take its Course; by which
it pleased God to deliver him from the Jaws of
Death.</P>
<P>A Gentleman in the County of <HI>Clare,</HI> near <HI>Ennis,</HI>
had a Fever and Pleurisy, and Inflammation of the
Lungs, being at the last Extremity, and given over
by two Physicians, he was advised to drink Tar-Water,
which he did, eight Quarts. Next Morn∣ing
one of the Doctors asking at what Hour his
Patient died? to his great Surprise found he was
recovered. This I had from a Parliament-Man his
Neighbour.</P>
<P>When the yellow Fever (as it was called) raged
in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> the Negroes, with a Tub of
Tar-Water in their Quarters, did well: but some
of the better Sort miscarried, among whom the
Physician himself lay at the Point of Death; but
his Brother recovered him by pouring down his
Throat in Spoonfuls, some of the same Liquor that
recovered the Negroes. The Fact was related to
me by a Gentleman who was then in the Island of
<HI>St. Christopher's,</HI> and knew it to be true.</P>
<P>A Physician himself, not long since assured me,
he had cured an Ulcer in the Bladder, by ordering
his Patient to drink Tar-Water, when he had tried
all other Methods in vain, and thought the Case
incurable</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>
But it would be endless to relate the Effects of
Tar-Water, in desperate Cases. The Recovery of
Mrs. <HI>Wilson,</HI> Daughter to the late Bishop of <HI>London,</HI>
from a lingering hopeless Disorder, was a noted
Case, and attested to by his Lordship. I have
even been informed upon good Authority, of two
or three Instances, wherein Persons have been re∣covered
by Tar-Water, after they had Rattles in
the Throat.</P>
<P>In certain Cases, a smaller Quantity of Tar-Water
hath proved ineffectual, when a larger hath
perfected the Cure. A Woman of <HI>Cloyne</HI> got cold
after Child-bearing, which occasioned a great Pain
in her Thigh, Swelling also and Redness; she con∣tinued
in great Torment above three Weeks. She
then began to drink Tar-Water, but not drinking
much she did not perceive much good; and when
there was not any Hopes of her Life, she was per∣suaded
to try what a Gallon a Day might do; upon
this she grew better, the Swelling broke and ran; no
Dressing was used but Tar, and no Washing but
Tar-Water, until she was quite recovered.</P>
<P>In Ailments of an odd and untried Nature, it
may be worth while to try Tar-Water. In Proof
of this many Instances might be given. A Gentle∣man
with a wither'd Arm had it restored by drink∣ing
Tar-Water. Another who, by running his
Head against a Post, had a Concussion of the Brain
attended with very bad Symptoms, recovered by
drinking Tar-Water after other Medicines had failed.
In my own Neighbourhood, one had lost the use of
his Limbs by Poison, another had been bitten by a
mad Ass; these Persons drank Tar-Water, and their
Cure was attributed to it.</P>
<P>When Tar-Water is copiously drank in Fevers,
the great Danger to be guarded against, is an ex∣cessive
Flow of Spirits, which excites the Patient to
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
talk and divert himself with Company, which may
produce a Relapse; of this I have known fatal
Effects.</P>
<P>If in a Course of Tar Water the Patient should
find himself heated, let him abstain from or lessen
his Dose of spirituous and fermented Liquors; for
Tar-Water alone never heats.</P>
<P>In chronical Disorders it is not adviseable, to
break off a Course of Tar-Water at once, but rather
to diminish the Quantity by Degrees.</P>
<P>The Acid alone hath not the medicinal Virtues
of Tar-Water. This is agreeable to Reason and
Experience, as well as the Opinion of the ablest
Judges. Doctor <HI>Linden</HI> justly observes, <Q REND="inline">"that when
the empyreumatic Oil is entirely separated from
the Acid, it is not in any Shape superior to any
other distilled Acids or Vinegars whatsoever."</Q>
<BIBL><HI>Treatise on Selter Water,</HI> p. 307.</BIBL></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Something of this Nature hath been long expected, and hoped for, if we may credit that learned Chymist Dr. <HI>Linden,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"at last (saith he) the long delayed Wishes of the most eminent Men of the Faculty are fulfilled, in the B. of <HI>C—yne</HI>'s Discovery."</Q> <BIBL>See <HI>Treatise on Selter Water,</HI> p. 303.</BIBL> Again (speaking of empyreumatic Oils of Plants) he hath these Words, <Q REND="inline">"There has always prevailed a Notion among the Chymists, and particularly with <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and his Fol∣lowers, that in those Oils there lay a great Secret undis∣covered. This Notion was occasioned by the strange Effects which a small Quantity thereof hath upon the human Machine. Several have been very diligent to discover this Secret, and to find out a Method to administer these Oils with Safety; yet nothing was performed salutary, until the B. of <HI>C.</HI> discovered to us the Tar-Water, to him alone we are indebted, for rendering the empyreumatic Oils a safe Medicine, in every respect."</Q><BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 302.</BIBL></NOTE> That extraordinary Virtues should be contained
in Tar-Water, will not seem strange, if we consider
that Pitch is nothing else but hardened Tar, or Tar
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
drained of its Moisture; and that an extraordinary
Quantity of Light is retained in the Substance of
Pitch, as appears from certain Electrical Experi∣ments,
which, having been made since, seem not
a little to confirm what had before been suggested
in <HI>Siris.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN
ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the Prosperity that preceded,
or the Calamities that succeed the South
Sea Project have most contributed to our undoing,
is not so clear a Point as it is that we are actually
undone, and lost to all Sense of our true Interest;
nothing less than this could render it pardonable, to
have Recourse to those old fashioned trite Maxims
concerning Religion, Industry, Frugality, and pub∣lic
Spirit, which are now forgotten, but if revived
and put in practice, may not only prevent our final
Ruin, but also render us a more happy and flourish∣ing
People than ever.</P>
<P>Religion hath in former Days been cherished and
reverenced by wise Patriots and Lawgivers, as know∣ing
it to be impossible that a Nation should thrive
and flourish without Virtue, or that Virtue should
subsist: without Conscience, or Conscience without
Religion: insomuch that an Atheist or Infidel was
looked on with Abhorrence, and treated as an
Enemy to his Country. But in these wiser Times,
a cold Indifference for the national Religion, and
indeed for all Matters of Faith and divine Worship,
is thought good Sense. It is even become fashion∣able
to decry Religion; and that little Talent of
Ridicule is applied to such wrong Purposes, that
<PB N="32" REF="30"/>
a good Christian can hardly keep himself in Coun∣tenance.</P>
<P>Liberty is the greatest human Blessing that a
virtuous Man can possess, and is very consistent
with the Duties of a good Subject and a good
Christian, but the present Age aboundeth with in∣judicious
Patrons of Liberty, who not distinguish∣ing
between that and Licentiousness, take the surest
Method to discredit what they would seem to pro∣pagate;
for, in effect, can there be a greater Affront
offered to that just Freedom of Thought and
Action, which is the Prerogative of a rational Crea∣ture,
or can any Thing recommend it less to honest
Minds than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scur∣rility
and Profaneness on the World? But it hath
been always observed of weak Men, that they
know not how to avoid one Extreme without run∣ning
into another.</P>
<P>Too many of this Sort pass upon vulgar Read∣ers
for great Authors, and Men of profound
Thought, not on account of any Superiority either
in Sense or Stile, both which they possess in a very
moderate Degree, nor of any Discoveries they have
made in Arts and Sciences, which they seem to be
little acquainted with: but purely because they flatter
the Passions of corrupt Men, who are pleased to
have the Clamours of Conscience silenced, and those
great Points of the Christian Religion made sus∣pected,
which withheld them from many Vices of
Pleasure and Interest, or made them uneasy in the
Commission of them.</P>
<P>In order to promote that laudable Design of
effacing all Sense of Religion from among us, they
form themselves into Assemblies, and proceed with
united Counsels and Endeavours; with what Suc∣cess,
and with what Merit towards the Public, the
Effect too plainly shews; I will not say, these
<PB N="33" REF="31"/>
Gentlemen have formed a direct Design to ruin
their Country, or that they have the Sense to see
half the ill Consequences, which must necessarily
flow from the spreading of their Opinions, but the
Nation feels them, and it is high time the Legis∣lature
put a stop to them.</P>
<P>I am not for placing an invidious Power in the
Hands of the Clergy, or complying with the nar∣rowness
of any mistaken Zealots, who should in∣cline
to persecute Dissenters: but whatever Conduct,
common Sense, as well as Christian Charity obligeth
us to use, towards those who differ from us in some
Points of Religion, yet the public Safety requireth,
that the avowed Contemners of all Religion should
be severely chastised, and perhaps it may be no
easy matter to assign a good Reason why Blasphemy
against God should not be inquired into, and pu∣nished
with the same Rigour as Treason against the
King.</P>
<P>For though we may attempt to patch up our
Affairs, yet it will be to no Purpose, the Finger of
God will unravel all our vain Projects, and make
them Snares to draw us into greater Calamities, if
we do not reform that scandalous Libertinism which
(whatever some shallow Men may think) is our
worst Symptom and the surest Prognostic of our
Ruin.</P>
<P>Industry is the natural sure Way to Wealth; this
is so true, that it is impossible an industrious free
People should want the Necessaries and Comforts of
Life, or an idle enjoy them under any Form of
Government. Money is so far useful to the Public,
as it promoteth Industry, and Credit having the
same Effect, is of the same Value with Money; but
Money or Credit circulating through a Nation
from hand to hand without producing Labour and
Industry in the Inhabitants, is direct Gaming.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="32"/>
It is not impossible for cunning Men to make
such plausible Schemes, as may draw those who are
less skilful into their own and the public Ruin.
But surely there is no Man of Sense and Honesty,
but must see and own, whether he understands the
Game or not, that it is an evident Folly for any
People, instead of prosecuting the old honest
Methods of Industry and Frugality, to sit down to
a public Gaming-table, and play off their Money
one to another.</P>
<P>The more Methods there are in a State for ac∣quiring
Riches without Industry or Merit, the less
there will be of either in that State; this is as evi∣dent
as the Ruin that attends it. Besides, when
Money is shifted from hand to hand in such a
blind fortuitous Manner, that some Men shall from
nothing in an instant acquire vast Estates, without
the least Desert; while others are as suddenly stript
of plentiful Fortunes, and left on the Parish by their
own Avarice and Credulity, what can be hoped for
on the one hand, but abandoned Luxury and
Wantonness, or on the other, but extreme Mad∣ness
and Despair.</P>
<P>In short, all Project for growing rich by sudden
and extraordinary Methods, as they operate violent∣ly
on the Passions of Men, and encourage them
to despise the slow moderate Gains that are to be
made by an honest Industry, must be ruinous to the
Public, and even the Winners themselves will at
length be involved in the public Ruin.</P>
<P>It is an easy matter to contrive Projects for the
Encouragement of Industry; I wish it were as easy
to persuade Men to put them in Practice. There
is no Country in Europe where there is so much
Charity collected for the Poor, and none where it is
so ill managed. If the Poor-tax was fixed at a
Medium in every Parish, taken from a Calculation
<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
of the last ten Years, and raised for seven Years by
Act of Parliament, that Sum (if the common
Estimate be not very wrong) frugally and pru∣dently
laid out in Work-houses, would for ever
free the Nation from the Care of providing for the
Poor, and at the same time considerably improve
our Manufactures. We might by these means rid
our Streets of Beggars, even the Children, the
maimed and the blind, might be put in a way of
doing something for their Livelihood. As for the
small Number of those, who by Age or Infirmities
are utterly incapable of all Employment, they
might be maintained by the Labour of others; and
the Public would receive no small Advantage from
the Industry of those, who are now so great a
Burden and Expence to it.</P>
<P>The same Tax, continued three Years longer,
might be very usefully employed in making high
Roads, and rendering Rivers navigable, two Things
of so much Profit and Ornament to a Nation, that
we seem the only People in <HI>Europe</HI> Who have neg∣lected
them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was published before Turnpikes were erected.</NOTE>. So that in the space of ten Years
the Public may be for ever freed from a heavy Tax,
Industry encouraged, Commerce facilitated, and
the whole Country improved, and all this only by
a frugal honest Management, without raising one
Peny extraordinary.</P>
<P>The Number of People is both Means and Mo∣tives
to Industry; it should therefore be of great
use to encourage Propagation, by allowing some
Reward or Privilege to those who have a certain
Number of Children; and on the other hand, en∣acting
that the Public shall inherit half the unin∣tailed
Estates of all who die unmarried of either
Sex.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="34"/>
Besides the immediate End proposed by the fore∣going
Methods, they furnish Taxes upon Passen∣gers,
and dead Bachelors, which are in no sort
grievous to the Subject, and may be applied towards
clearing the public Debt, which, all Mankind agree,
highly concerneth the Nation in general, both Court
and Country. <HI>Caesar</HI> indeed, mentions it as a Piece
of Policy, that he borrowed Money from his Officers
to bestow it on the Soldiers, which fixed both to
his Interest; and though something like this may
pass for Skill at certain Junctures in civil Govern∣ment,
yet if carried too far, it will prove a dan∣gerous
Experiment.</P>
<P>There is still Room for Invention or Improve∣ment
in most Trades and Manufactures, and it is
probable, that Praemiums given on that Account to
ingenious Artists, would soon be re-paid an hundred-fold
to the Public. No Colour is so much wore
in <HI>Italy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> as Black; but our
black Cloth is neither so lasting, nor of so good a
Dye as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which is the Reason of their in∣grossing
the Profit of that Trade; this is so true,
that I have known <HI>English</HI> Merchants abroad wear
black Cloth of <HI>Holland</HI> themselves, and sell and re∣commend
it as better than that of their own
Country. It is commonly said the Water of <HI>Leyden</HI>
hath a peculiar Property for colouring Black, but it
hath been also said and passed current, that good
Glasses may be made no where but at <HI>Venice,</HI> and
there only in the Island of <HI>Murano:</HI> which was at∣tributed
to some peculiar Property in the Air; and
we may possibly find other Opinions of that sort
to be as groundless, should the Legislature think it
worth while to propose Praemiums in the foregoing,
or in the like Cases of general Benefit to the Public;
but I remember to have seen, about seven Years ago,
a Man pointed at in a Coffee-House, who (they said)
<PB N="37" REF="35"/>
had first introduced the right scarlet Dye among us,
by which the Nation in general, as well as many
private Persons, have since been great Gainers
though he was himself a Beggar, who, if this be
true, deserved an honourable Maintenance from the
Public.</P>
<P>There are also several Manufactures which we
have from abroad, that may be carried on to as
great Perfection here as elsewhere. If it be con∣sidered
that more fine Linen is wore in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
than in any other Country of <HI>Europe,</HI> it will be
difficult to assign a Reason why Paper may not be
made here as good, and in the same Quantity, as in
<HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Genoa.</HI> This is a Manu∣facture
of great Consumption, and would save much
to the Public. The like may be said of Tapestry,
Lace, and other Manufactures, which is set on foot
in cheap Parts of the Country, would employ many
Hands, and save Money to the Nation, as well as
bring it from abroad. Projects for improving old
Manufactures, or setting up new ones, should not
be despised in a trading Country, but the making
them Pretences for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal
Imposition.</P>
<P>As Industry dependeth upon Trade, and this, as
well as the public Security, upon our Navigation,
it concerneth the Legislature to provide, that the
Number of our Sailors do not decrease, to which it
would very much conduce, if a Law were made
prohibiting the Payment of Sailors in foreign Parts;
for it is usual with those on board Merchant-Men
as soon as they set foot on Shore to receive their
Pay, which is soon spent in riotous Living; and
when they have emptied their Pockets, the Tempta∣tion
of a Pistole present Money, never faileth to
draw them into any foreign Service. To this, (if
I may credit the Information I have had from some
<PB N="38" REF="36"/>
<HI>English</HI> Factors abroad) it is chiefly owing, that
the <HI>Venetians, Spaniards,</HI> and others, have so many
<HI>English</HI> on board their Ships; some Merchants
indeed and Masters of Vessels may make a Profit
in defrauding those poor Wretches when they pay
them in strange Coin (which I have been assured
often amounts to twelve Pence in the Crown) as well
as in ridding themselves of the Charge of keeping
them when they sell their Ships, or stay long in
Port, but the Public lose both the Money and the
Men; who, if their Arrears were to be cleared at
home, would be sure to return, and spend them in
their own Country: It is a Shame this Abuse should
not be remedied.</P>
<P>Frugality of Manners is the Nourishment and
Strength of Bodies politic. It is that by which
they grow and subsist, until they are corrupted by
Luxury; the natural Cause of their Decay and Ruin.
Of this we have Examples in the <HI>Persians, Lace∣daemonians,</HI>
and <HI>Romans:</HI> not to mention many later
Governments which have sprung up, continued a
while, and then perished by the same natural Causes.
But these are, it seems, of no use to us; and, in
spite of them, we are in a fair Way of becoming
ourselves, another useless Example to future Ages.</P>
<P>Men are apt to measure national Prosperity by
Riches, it would be righter to measure it by the
Use that is made of them. Where they promote
an honest Commerce among Men, and are Motives
to Industry and Virtue, they are without doubt of
great Advantage; but where they are made (as too
often happens) an Instrument to Luxury, they
enervate and dispirit the bravest People. So just is
that Remark of <HI>Machiavel,</HI> that there is no Truth
in the common Saying, Money is the Nerves of
War; and though we may subsist tolerably for a
Time among corrupt Neighbours, yet if ever we
<PB N="39" REF="37"/>
have to do with a hardy, temperate, religious Sort
of Men, we shall find to our Cost, that all our
Riches are but a poor Exchange for that Simplicity
of Manners which we despise in our Ancestors.
This sole Advantage hath been the main Support of
all the Republics that have made a Figure in the
World; and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a
Kingdom to form itself upon the Manners of a
Republic.</P>
<P>Simplicity of Manners may be more easily pre∣served
in a Republic than a Monarchy; but if once
lost, may be sooner recovered in a Monarchy, the
Example of a Court being of great Efficacy, either
to reform or to corrupt a People; that alone were
sufficient to discountenance the wearing of Gold or
Silver, either in Cloaths or Equipage, and it the
same were prohibited by Law, the saving so much
Bullion would be the smallest Benefit of such an
Institution; there being nothing more apt to debase
the Virtue and good Sense of our Gentry of both
Sexes, than the trifling Vanity of Apparel, which
we have learned from <HI>France,</HI> and which hath had
such visible ill Consequences on the Genius of that
People. Wiser Nations have made it their Care to
shut out this Folly by severe Laws and Penalties, and
its spreading among us can forbode no good, if
there be any Truth in the Observation of one of the
Ancients, that the direct Way to ruin a Man is to
dress him up in fine Cloaths.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dress giveth
a light Behaviour to our Women, which may pass
for a small Offence, because it is a common one, but
is in truth the Source of great Corruptions. For
this very Offence the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> denounced a
severe Judgment against the Ladies of his Time.
I shall give the Passage at length; <Q REND="inline">'Moreover, the
LORD saith, because the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> are
<PB N="40" REF="38"/>
haughty, and walk with stretched forth Necks
and wanton Eyes, walking and mincing as they
go, and making a Tinkling with their Feet;
therefore the LORD will smite with a Scab the
Crown of the Head of the Daughters of <HI>Zion,</HI>
and the LORD will discover their secret Parts. In
that Day the Lord will take away the Bravery
of their tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and
their Cauls, and their round Tires like the Moon,
the Chains, and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers,
the Bonnets, and the Ornaments of the Legs, and
the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Earrings,
the Rings, and Nose jewels, the change∣able
Suits of Apparel, and the Mantles, and the
Wimples, and the crisping Pins, the Glasses, and
the fine Linen, and the Hoods and the Vails.
And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet
Smell there shall be a Stink; and instead of a
Girdle a Rent; and instead of well-set Hair, Bald∣ness;
and instead of a Stomacher, a Girding of
Sackcloth; and Burning instead of Beauty:'</Q> The
Scab, the Stench, and the Burning are terrible
pestilential Symptoms, and our Ladies would do
well to consider, they may chance to resemble those
of <HI>Zion,</HI> in their Punishment as well as their
Offence.</P>
<P>But Dress is not the only Thing to be reformed,
sumptuary Laws are useful in many other Points.
In former Times the natural Plainness and good
Sense of the <HI>English</HI> made them less necessary. But
ever since the luxurious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
second, we have been doing violence to our Na∣tures,
and are by this time so much altered for
the worse, that it is to be feared, the very same
Dispositions that make them necessary, will for
ever hinder them from being enacted or put in
Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="39"/>
A private Family in difficult Circumstances, all
Men agree, ought to melt down their Plate, walk
on Foot, retrench the Number of their Servants,
wear neither Jewels nor rich Cloaths, and deny
themselves expensive Diversions; and why not the
Public? had any Thing like this been done, our
Taxes had been less, or which is the same thing,
we should have felt them less. But it is very re∣markable,
that Luxury was never at so great a
Height, nor spread so generally through the Na∣tion,
as during the Expence of the late Wars, and
the heavy Debt that still lieth upon us.</P>
<P>This Vice draweth after it a Train of Evils
which cruelly infest the Public; Faction, Ambi∣tion,
Envy, Avarice, and that of the worst kind,
being much more hurtful in its Consequences,
though not so infamous as Penury. It was the
great Art of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu,</HI> by encouraging
Luxury and Expence to impoverish the <HI>French</HI> No∣bility,
and render them altogether dependent on
the Crown, which hath been since very successfully
effected. These and many more Considerations
shew the Necessity there is for sumptuary Laws,
nor can any thing be said against them in this
Island, which might not with equal Force be ob∣jected
in other Countries, which have nevertheless
judged the public Benefit of such Institutions, to be
of far greater Importance than the short Sufferings
of a few, who subsist by the Luxury of others.</P>
<P>It is evident, that old Taxes may be better born,
as well as new ones raised by sumptuary Laws ju∣diciously
framed, not to damage our Trade, but
retrench our Luxury. It is evident, that for want
of these, Luxury (which, like the other Fashions,
never faileth to descend) hath infected all Ranks of
People, and that this enableth the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI>
to undersell us, to the great Prejudice of our
<PB N="42" REF="40"/>
Traffic. We cannot but know that in our present
Circumstances, it should be our Care, as it is our
Interest to make Poverty tolerable; in short we
have the Experience of many Ages to convince us,
that a corrupt luxurious People must of themselves
fall into Slavery, although no Attempt be made
upon them. These and the like obvious Reflecti∣ons
should, one would think, have forced any
People in their Senses upon frugal Measures.</P>
<P>But we are doomed to be undone. Neither the
plain Reason of the Thing, nor the Experience of
past Ages, nor the Examples we have before our
Eyes, can restrain us from imitating, not to say
surpassing, the most corrupt and ruined People, in
those very Points of Luxury that ruined them.
Our Gaming, our Operas, our Maskerades, are,
in spite of our Debts and Poverty, become the
Wonder of our Neighbours. If there be
any Man so void of all Thought and common Sense,
as not to see where this must end, let him but com∣pare
what <HI>Venice</HI> was at the League of <HI>Cambray,</HI>
with what it is at present, and he will be convinced,
how truly those fashionable Pastimes are calculated
to depress and ruin a Nation.</P>
<P>But neither <HI>Venice</HI> nor <HI>Paris,</HI> nor any other
Town in any Part of the World, ever knew such
an expensive ruinous Folly as our Maskerade.
This alone is sufficient to inflame and satisfy the se∣veral
Appetites for Gaming, Dressing, Intriguing,
luxurious Eating and Drinking. It is a most skil∣ful
Abridgment, the very Quintessence, the abstract
of all those senseless Vanities, that have ever been
the Ruin of Fools and Detestation of wise Men.
And all this under the Notion of an elegant Enter∣tainment,
hath been admitted among us; though
it be in truth a Contagion of the worst Kind.
The Plague, dreadful as it is, is an Evil of short
<PB N="43" REF="41"/>
duration; Cities have often recovered and flourish∣ed
after it; but when was it known that a People
broken and corrupt by Luxury recovered them∣selves?
not to say, that general Corruption of
Manners never faileth to draw after it some heavy
Judgment of War, Famine, or Pestilence. Of
this we have a fresh Instance in one of the most
debauched Towns of <HI>Europe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marseilles.</NOTE>, and no Body
knows how soon it may be our own Case. This
elegant Entertainment is indeed suspended for the
present, but there remains so strong a Propension
towards it, that, if the Wisdom of the Legislature
does not interpose, it will soon return with the ad∣ditional
Temptation of having been forbid for a
Time. It were stupid and barbarous to declaim
against keeping up the Spirit of the People by pro∣per
Diversions, but then they should be proper,
such as polish and improve their Mind, or increase
the Strength and Activity of their Bodies; none
of which Ends are answered by the Maskerade,
no more than by those <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Follies,
which, to our Shame, are imported and encourag∣ed
at a Time, when the Nation ought to be too
grave for such Trifles.</P>
<P>It is not to be believed, what Influence public
Diversions have on the Spirit and Manners of a Peo∣ple.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> wisely saw this, and made a very
serious Affair of their public Sports. For the
same Reason, it will perhaps seem worthy the Care
of our Legislature, to regulate the public Diversions,
by an absolute Prohibition of those which have a
direct Tendency to corrupt our Morals, as well as
by a Reformation of the Drama; which, when
rightly managed, is such a noble Entertainment,
and gave those fine Lessons of Morality and good
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>
Sense to the <HI>Athenians</HI> of old, and to our <HI>British</HI>
Gentry above a Century ago; but for these last
ninety Years, hath entertained us, for the most
part, with such wretched Things as spoil, instead
of improving the Taste and Manners of the Audi∣ence.
Those who are attentive to such Proposi∣tions
only, as may fill their Pockets, will probably
slight these Things as Trifles below the Care of
the Legislature. But I am sure, all honest think∣ing
Men must lament to see their Country run
headlong into all those luxurious Follies, which, it
is evident, have been fatal to other Nations, and
will undoubtedly prove fatal to us also, if a timely
Stop be not put to them.</P>
<P>Public Spirit, that glorious Principle of all that
is great and good, is so far from being cherished
or encouraged, that it is become ridiculous in this
enlightened Age, which is taught to laugh at every
Thing that is serious as well as sacred. The same
atheistical narrow Spirit, centring all our Cares upon
private Interest, and contracting all our Hopes
within the Enjoyment of this present Life, equally
produceth a Neglect of what we owe to God and
our Country. <HI>Tully</HI> hath long since observed, <Q REND="inline">"that
it is impossible for those, who have no Belief of
the Immortality of the Soul or a future State
of Rewards and Punishments, to sacrifice their
particular Interests and Passions to the public
Good, or have a generous Concern for Poste∣rity,"</Q>
and our own Experience confirmeth the
Truth of this Observation.</P>
<P>In order therefore to recover a Sense of public
Spirit, it is to be wished that Men were first affect∣ed
with a true Sense of Religion; <HI>pro aris &amp; focis,</HI>
having ever been the great Motive to Courage and
Perseverance in a public Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="43"/>
It would likewise be a very useful Policy, and
warranted by the Example of the wisest Govern∣ments,
to make the natural Love of Fame and Re∣putation
subservient to promoting that noble Prin∣ciple.
Triumphal Arches, Columns, Statues, In∣scriptions,
and the like Monuments of public Ser∣vices,
have in former Times been found great In∣centives
to Virtue and Magnanimity, and would
probably have the same Effects on <HI>Englishmen</HI> which
they have had on <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And per∣haps
a Pillar of Infamy would be found a proper
and exemplary Punishment in Cases of signal pub∣lic
Villany, where the Loss of Fortune, Liberty,
or Life, are not proportioned to the Crime; or,
where the Skill of the Offender, or the Nature of
his Offence, may skreen him from the Letter of
the Law.</P>
<P>Several of these are to be seen at <HI>Genoa, Milan,</HI>
and other Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> where it is the Custom
to demolish the House of a Citizen, who hath con∣spired
the Ruin of his Country, or been guilty of
any enormous Crime towards the Public, and in
place thereof to erect a Monument of the Crime,
and Criminal described, in the blackest manner.
We have nothing of this sort, that I know, but
that which is commonly called the Monument,
which in the last Age was erected for an Affair
no way more atrocious than the modern unex∣ampled
Attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Project.</NOTE> of Men easy in their Fortunes,
and unprovoked by Hardships of any sort, in cool
Blood, and with open Eyes to ruin their native
Country. This Fact will never be forgotten, and
it were to be wished that with it the public Detes∣tation
thereof may be transmitted to Posterity,
which would in some measure vindicate the Honour
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>
of the present, and be a useful Lesson to future
Ages.</P>
<P>Those noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture,
and Paintings do not only adorn the Public, but
have also an Influence on the Minds and Manners
of Men, filling them with great Ideas, and spirit∣ing
them up to an Emulation of worthy Actions.
For this Cause they were cultivated and encourag∣ed
by the <HI>Greek</HI> Cities, who vied with each other
in building and adorning their Temples, Theatres,
Porticos, and the like public Works, at the same
Time that they discouraged private Luxury, the
very Reverse of our Conduct.</P>
<P>To propose the building a Parliament House,
Courts of Justice, Royal Palace, and other public
Edifices, suitable to the Dignity of the Nation, and
adorning them with Paintings and Statues, which
may transmit memorable Things and Persons to
Posterity, would probably be laughed at as a vain
Affair, of great Expence, and little Use to the
Public; and it must be owned, we have reduced
ourselves to such Straits, that any Proposition of
Expence-suiteth ill with our present Circumstances.
But how proper soever this Proposal may be for
the Times, yet it comes so properly into a Discourse
of public Spirit, that I could not but say something
of it. And at another Time it will not seem un∣reasonable,
if we consider that it is no more than
the wisest Nations have done before us, that it would
spirit up new Arts, employ many Hands, keep the
Money circulating at home, and lastly, that it would
be a notable Instance of public Spirit, as well as a
Motive to it.</P>
<P>The same noble Principle may be also encou∣raged
by erecting an Academy of ingenious Men,
whose Employment it would be to compile the
History of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to make Discourses pro∣per
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>
to inspire Men with a Zeal for the Public, and
celebrate the Memory of those who have been Or∣naments
to the Nation, or done it eminent Service.
Not to mention that this would improve our Lan∣guage,
and amuse some busy Spirits of the Age;
which perhaps would be no ill Policy.</P>
<P>This is not without Example; for to say nothing
of the <HI>French</HI> Academy, which is prostituted to
meaner Purposes, it hath been the Custom of the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Senate to appoint one of their Order to con∣tinue
the History of the Republic. This was intro∣duced
in the flourishing State of that People, and is
still in force. We fall short of other Nations in
the Number of good Historians, though no Nation
in Christendom hath produced greater Events, or
more worthy to be recorded. The <HI>Athenian</HI> Senate
appointed Orators to commemorate annually, those
who died in Defence of their Country, which Solem∣nity
was performed at the Monuments erected in Ho∣nour
of them by the Public; and the Panegyrics,
composed by <HI>Isocrates</HI> and <HI>Pericles,</HI> as well as
many Passages in <HI>Tully,</HI> inform us with what Plea∣sure
the ancient Orators used to expatiate in Praise
of their Country.</P>
<P>Concord and Union among ourselves is rather to
be hoped for, as an Effect, of public Spirit, than
proposed as a Means to promote it. Candid, ge∣nerous
Men, who are true Lovers of their Coun∣try,
can never be Enemies to one half of their
Countrymen, or carry their Resentment so far as to
ruin the Public for the sake of a Party. Now I
have fallen upon the mention of our Parties, I shall
beg leave to insert a Remark or two, for the Ser∣vice
both of Whig and Tory, without entering
into their respective Merits. First, it is impossible
for either Party to ruin the other, without involv∣ing
themselves and their Posterity in the same Ruin.
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
Secondly, it is very feasible for either Paty to get
the better of the other, if they could first get the
better of themselves; and instead of indulging the
little womanish Passions of Obstinacy, Resentment,
and Revenge, steadily promote the true Interest of
their Country, in those great clear Points of Piety,
Industry, Sobriety of Manners, and an honest Re∣gard
for Posterity; which, all Men of Sense agree,
are essential to public Happiness. There would be
something so great and good in this Conduct, as
must necessarily overbear all Calumny and Oppo∣sition.
But that Men should act reasonably, is ra∣ther
to be wished than hoped.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that to talk of public Spirit,
and the Means of retrieving it, must to narrow sor∣did
Minds be matter of Jest and Ridicule, how con∣formable
soever it be to right Reason, and the
Maxims of Antiquity. Though one would think,
the most selfish Man might see it was their Interest
to encourage a Spirit in others, by which they, to
be sure, must be Gainers. Yet such is the Corrup∣tion
and Folly of the present Age, that a public
Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the World, and
want of Sense; and all the Respect is paid to cun∣ning
Men, who bend and wrest the public Interest
to their own private Ends, that in other Times
hath been thought due to those who were generous
enough to sacrifice their private Interest to that of
their Country.</P>
<P>Such Practices and such Maxims as these must
necessarily ruin a State. But if the contrary
should prevail, we may hope to see Men in Power
prefer the public Wealth and Security to their own,
and Men of Money make free Gifts, or lend it
without Interest to their Country. This, how
strange and incredible soever it may seem to us,
hath been often done in other States. And the
<PB N="49" REF="47"/>
natural <HI>English</HI> Temper considered, together with
the Force of Example, no one can tell how far a
Proposal for a free Gift may go among the moneyed
Men, when set on foot by the Legislature, and
encouraged by the Example of two or three Men
of Figure, who have the Spirit to do a generous
Thing, and the Understanding to see it is every
private Man's Interest to support that of the Public.</P>
<P>If they who have their Fortunes in Money should
make a voluntary Gift, the Public would be eased,
and at the same time maintain its Credit. Nor
is a generous Love of their Country the only Motive
that should induce them to this. Common Equity
requires, that all Subjects should equally share the
public Burden. And common Sense shews, that
those who are foremost in the Danger, should not
be the most backward in contributing to prevent it.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Subject, I cannot but take
notice of that most infamous Practice of Bribery,
than which nothing can be more opposite to public
Spirit, since every one who takes a Bribe plainly
owns, that he prefers his private Interest to that of
his Country. This Corruption is become a national
Crime, having infected the lowest as well as the
highest among us, and is so general and notorious,
that, as it cannot be matched in former Ages, so it
is to be hoped it will not be imitated by Posterity.</P>
<P>This calls to mind another national Guilt, which
we possess in a very eminent Degree; there being
no Nation under the Sun, where solemn Perjury
is so common, or where there are such Temptations
to it. The making Men swear so often in their
own Cases, and where they have an Interest to con∣ceal
the Truth, hath gradually wore off that awful
Respect which was once thought due to an Appeal
to Almighty God; insomuch, that Men now a
Days break their Fast, and a Custom-House Oath
<PB N="50" REF="48"/>
with the same Peace of Mind. It is a Policy pe∣culiar
to us, the obliging Men to perjure or betray
themselves, and hath had no one good Effect, but
many very ill ones. Sure I am, that other Nations,
without the hundredth Part of our Swearing, con∣trive
to do their Business, at least as well as we do.
And perhaps our Legislature will think it proper to
follow their Example. For whatever Measures are
taken, so long as we lie under such a Load of Guilt,
as national Perjury and national Bribery, it is im∣possible
we can prosper.</P>
<P>This poor Nation hath sorely smarted of late,
and to ease the present Smart, a sudden Remedy
(as is usual in such Cases) hath been thought of.
But we must beware not to mistake an Anodyne
for a Cure. Where the Vitals are touched, and the
whole Mass of Humours vitiated, it is not enough
to ease the Part pained, we must look further, and
apply general Correctives; otherwise the ill Hu∣mour
may soon shew itself in some other Part.</P>
<P>The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Affair, how sensible soever, is not
the original Evil, or the great Source of our Mis∣fortunes,
it is but the natural Effect of those Prin∣ciples,
which for many Years have been propagated
with great Industry. And as a sharp Distemper, by
reclaiming a Man from Intemperance, may pro∣long
his Life, so it is not impossible but this pub∣lic
Calamity that lies so heavy on the Nation may
prevent its Ruin. It would certainly prove the
greatest of Blessings, if it should make all honest
Men of one Party; if it should put Religion and
Virtue in Countenance, restore a Sense of public
Spirit, and convince Men it is a dangerous Folly to
pursue private Aims in Opposition to the Good of
their Country, if it should turn our Thoughts from
Cozenage and Stock-jobbing, to Industry and
frugal Methods of Life; in fine, if it should re∣vive
<PB N="51" REF="49"/>
and inflame that native Spark of <HI>British</HI> Worth
and Honour, which hath too long lain smothered
and oppressed.</P>
<P>With this View I have, among so many Projects
for remedying the ill State of our Affairs in a par∣ticular
Instance, ventured to publish the foregoing
general Hints, which as they have been thrown to∣gether
from a Zeal for the public Good, so I heartily
wish they may be regarded neither more nor less,
than as they are fitted to promote that End.</P>
<P>Though it must be owned, that little can be
hoped if we consider the corrupt degenerate Age we
live in. I know it is an old Folly to make peevish
Complaints of the Times, and charge the common
Failures of human Nature on a particular Age.
One may nevertheless venture to affirm, that the
present hath brought forth new and portentous Vil∣lanies,
not to be paralleled in our own or any other
History. We have been long preparing for some
great Catastrophe. Vice and Villany have by
degrees grown reputable among us; our Infidels
have passed for fine Gentlemen, and our venal
Traitors for Men of Sense, who knew the World.
We have made a Jest of public Spirit, and cancelled
all Respect for whatever our Laws and Religion re∣pute
sacred. The old <HI>English</HI> Modesty is quite
worn off, and instead of blushing for our Crimes,
we are ashamed only of Piety and Virtue. In short,
other Nations have been wicked, but we are the
first who have been wicked upon Principle.</P>
<P>The Truth is, our Symptoms are so bad, that
notwithstanding all the Care and Vigilance of the
Legislature, it is to be feared the final Period of our
State approaches. Strong Constitutions, whether
politic or natural, do not feel light Disorders. But,
when they are sensibly affected, the Distemper is for
the most part violent and of an ill Prognostic.
<PB N="52" REF="50"/>
Free Governments like our own were planted by
the <HI>Goths</HI> in most Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and though we
all know what they are come to, yet we seem
disposed rather to follow their Example, than to
profit by it.</P>
<P>Whether it be in the Order of Things, that civil
States should have, like natural Products, their
several Periods of Growth, Perfection, and Decay;
or whether it be an Effect, as seems more probable,
of human Folly, that as Industry produces Wealth,
so Wealth should produce Vice, and Vice Ruin.</P>
<P>God grant the Time be not near, when Men shall
say, <Q REND="inline">'This Island was once inhabited by a religious,
brave, sincere People, of plain uncorrupt Manners,
respecting inbred Worth rather than Titles and
Appearances, Assertors of Liberty, Lovers of their
Country, jealous of their own Rights, and unwill∣ing
to infringe the Rights of others; Improvers
of Learning and useful Arts, Enemies to Luxury,
tender of other Mens Lives, and prodigal of their
own; inferior in nothing to the old <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
and superior to each of those People in the
Perfections of the other. Such were our Ancestors
during their Rise and Greatness; but they de∣generated,
grew servile Flatterers of Men in
Power, adopted Epicurean Notions, became venal▪
corrupt, injurious, which drew upon them the
Hatred of God and Man, and occasioned their
final Ruin.'</Q></P>

DISCOURSE
ADDRESSED TO
MAGISTRATES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pretensions and Discourse of Men,
throughout these Kingdoms, would, at first
View, lead one to think the Inhabitants were all
Politicians; and yet, perhaps, political Wisdom
hath in no Age, or Country, been more talked of,
and less understood. Licence is taken for the End
of Government, and popular Humour for its Origin.
No Reverence for the Law, no Attachment to the
Constitution, little Attention to Matters of Conse∣quence,
and great Altercation upon Trifles, such
idle Projects about Religion and Government, as
if the Public had both to choose, a general Contempt
of all Authority, divine and human, an Indifference
about the prevailing Opinions, whether they tend to
produce Order or Disorder, to promote the Empire
of God or the Devil: These are the Symptoms that
strongly mark the present Age; and this could
never have been the Case, if a Neglect of Religion
had not made Way for it.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="53"/>
When the <HI>Jews</HI> accused <HI>Paul</HI> upon religious
Matters and Points of their Law before <HI>Gallio,</HI> the
<HI>Roman</HI> Magistrate; it is said, that GALLIO <HI>cared
for none of those Things.</HI> And, it is to be feared,
there are not a few Magistrates in this Christian
Country who think with the same Indifference on
the subject of Religion. Herein, nevertheless,
they judge amiss, and are much wanting to their
Duty. For, although it be admitted, that the
Magistrate's peculiar Object, is the temporal Wel∣fare
of the State; yet, this will by no Means exclude
a proper Care about the prevailing Notions and
Opinions of Religion, which influence the Lives
and Actions of Men, and have therefore a mighty
Effect on the Public. Mens, Behaviour is the Con∣sequence
on their Principles. Hence it follows, that
in order to make a State thrive and flourish, Care
must be taken, that good Principles be propagated
in the Minds of those who compose it.</P>
<P>It would be vain to depend on the outward Form,
the Constitution, and Structure of a State; while
the Majority are ever governed by their inward
Ways of thinking, which at Times will break out
and shew themselves paramount to all Laws and In∣stitutions
whatsoever. It must be great Folly there∣fore
to overlook Notion, as Matters of small Mo∣ment
to the State; while Experience shews there
is nothing more important; and that a prevailing
Disorder in the Principles and Opinions of its
Members, is ever dangerous to Society, and capable
of producing the greatest public Evils.</P>
<P>Man is an Animal, formidable both from his
Passions and his Reason; his Passions often urging
him to great Evils, and his Reason furnishing
Means to atchieve them. To tame this Animal,
and make him amenable to Order, to inure him
to a Sense of Justice and Virtue, to withhold him
<PB N="57" REF="54"/>
from ill Courses by Fear, and encourage him in
his Duty by Hopes; in short, to fashion and model
him for Society, hath been the Aim of civil and
religious Institutions, and in all Times, the En∣deavour
of good and wise Men. The aptest
Method for attaining this End, hath been always
judged a proper Education.</P>
<P>If Mens Actions are an Effect of their Principles,
that is, of their Notions, their Belief, their Per∣suasions;
it must be admitted, that Principles early
sown in the Mind, are the Seeds which produce
Fruit and Harvest in the ripe State of Manhood.
How lightly soever some Men may speak of No∣tions;
yet, so long as the Soul governs the Body,
Mens Notions must influence their Actions, more
or less, as they are stronger or weaker; and to
Good or Evil, as they are better or worse.</P>
<P>Our Notions and Opinions are a constant Check
on our Appetites, and Balance to our Passions;
and, although they may not in every Instance con∣trol
and rule, yet they will never fail, strongly to
affect both the one and the other. What is it that
bridles the impetuous Desires of Men? That re∣strains
them when they are driven by the most vio∣lent
Passions? In a word, what is it that renders
this World habitable, but the prevailing Notions
of Order, Virtue, Duty and Providence? Some,
perhaps, may imagine, that the Eye of the Ma∣gistrate
alone is sufficient to keep Mankind in Awe,
But, if every Man's Heart was set to do all the
Mischief his Appetite should prompt him to, as
often as Opportunity and Secrecy presented them∣selves,
there could be no Living in the World.</P>
<P>And although too many of those intrusted with
civil Power, in these our Days, may be said with
GALLIO, to <HI>care for none of those Things;</HI> and
many more who would pass for Men of Judgment
<PB N="58" REF="55"/>
and Knowledge, may look on Notions early im∣bibed,
before their Grounds▪ and Reasons are ap∣prehended
or understood, to be but mere Pre∣judices;
yet this will detract nothing from their
Truth and Usefulness. To place this Matter in a
due Light, I propose to shew, that a System of
salutary Notions, is absolutely necessary to the Sup∣port
of every civil Constitution. I shall enforce
this Point, by the Testimony of those who are
esteemed the wisest Men; and I shall make some
Remarks on the modern prevailing Spirit, and the
Tendency of the Maxims of our Times.</P>
<P>Order is necessary, not only to the Well-Being,
but to the very Being of a State. Now, Order
and Regularity in the Actions of Men, is not an
Effect of Appetite or Passion, but of Judgment;
and the Judgment is governed by Notions or
Opinions. There must therefore, of Necessity, in
every State, be a certain System of salutary Notions,
a prevailing Set of Opinions, acquired either by
private Reason and Reflexion, or taught and in∣stilled
by the general Reason of the Public, that
is, by the Law of the Land. True it is, that
where Men either cannot, or will not use their own
Reason, think and examine for themselves; in such
Case, the Notions taught or instilled into their
Minds are embraced rather by the Memory, than
the Judgment. Nor will it be any Objection to
say, that these are Prejudices; inasmuch as they are
therefore, neither the less useful, nor the less true,
although their Proofs may not be understood by all
Men.</P>
<P>Prejudices are Notions, or Opinions, which the
Mind entertains without knowing the Grounds and
Reasons of them, and which are assented to with∣out
Examination. The first Notions which take
possession of the Minds of Men, with regard to
<PB N="59" REF="56"/>
Duties social, moral, and civil, may therefore be
justly stiled Prejudices. The Mind of a young
Creature cannot remain empty; if you do not put
into it that which is good, it will be sure to receive
that which is bad.</P>
<P>Do what you can, there will still be a Bias from
Education; and if so, is it not better this Bias
should lie towards Things laudable and useful to
Society? This Bias still operates, although it may
not always prevail. The Notions first instilled, have
the earliest Influence, take the deepest Root, and
generally are found to give a Colour and Com∣plexion
to the subsequent Lives of Men, inasmuch
as they are in Truth, the great Source of human
Actions. It is not Gold, or Honour, or Power,
that move Men to act, but the Opinions they en∣tertain
of those Things. Hence it follows, that if
a Magistrate should say, No Matter what Notions
Men embrace, I will take heed to their Actions;
therein he shews his Weakness; for such as are
Mens Notions, such will be their Deeds.</P>
<P>For a Man to do, as he would be done by; to
love his Neighbour as himself; to honour his Su∣periors;
to believe that God scans all his Actions,
and will reward or punish them; and to think,
that he who is guilty of Falshood, or Injustice,
hurts himself more than any one else: Are not these
such Notions, and Principles, as every wife Gover∣nor,
or Legislator, would covet above all Things,
to have firmly rooted in the Mind of every Indi∣vidual
under his Care? This is allowed, even by
the Enemies of Religion, who would fain have it
thought the Offspring of State Policy; honouring
its Usefulness at the same Time that they disparage
its Truth. What, therefore, cannot be acquired
by every Man's Reasoning, must be introduced by
Precept, and riveted by Custom; that is to say, the
<PB N="60" REF="57"/>
Bulk of Mankind must in all civilized Societies,
have their Minds by timely Instruction well season∣ed
and furnished with proper Notions, which, al∣though
the Grounds or Proofs thereof be unknown
to them, will nevertheless influence their Conduct,
and so far render them useful Members of the State,
But, if you strip Men of these their Notions, or,
if you will, Prejudices, with regard to Modesty,
Decency, Justice, Charity, and the like; you will
soon find them so many Monsters, utterly unfit for
human Society.</P>
<P>I desire it may be considered, that most Men want
Leisure, Opportunity, or Faculties, to derive Con∣clusions
from their Principles, and establish Morality
on a Foundation of human Science. True it is, (as
St. <HI>Paul</HI> observes) that <HI>The invisible Things of God
from the Creation of the World, are clearly seen.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROM. Ch. i. Ver. 20.</NOTE>
And from thence the Duties of natural Religion
may be discovered. But these Things are seen and
discovered by those alone who open their Eyes, and
look narrowly for them. Now, if you look through∣out
the World, you shall find but few of these nar∣row
Inspectors and Inquirers, very few who make
it their Business to analyse Opinions and pursue them
to their rational Source, to examine whence Truths
spring, and how they are inferred. In short, you
shall find all Men full of Opinions, but Knowledge
only in a few.</P>
<P>It is impossible from the Nature and Circum∣stances
of human Kind, that the Multitude should
be Philosophers, or that they should know Things
in their Causes. We see every Day, that the Rules,
or Conclusions alone, are sufficient for the Shop∣keeper
to state his Account, the Sailor to navigate
his Ship, or the Carpenter to measure his Timber;
<PB N="61" REF="58"/>
none of which understand the Theory; that is to
say, the Grounds and Reasons either of Arithmetic
or Geometry. Even so in moral, political, and
religious Matters, it is manifest, that the Rules and
Opinions early imbibed at the first Dawn of Un∣derstanding,
and without the least Glimpse of
Science, may yet produce excellent Effects, and be
very useful to the World: And that in Fact they
are so, will be very visible to every one who shall
observe what passeth round about him.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to inculcate, that the Dif∣ference
between Prejudices and other Opinions doth
not consist in this; that the former are false, and
the latter true; but in this, that the former are taken
upon Trust, and the latter acquired by Reasoning.
He, who hath been taught to believe the Immor∣tality
of the Soul, may be as right in his Notion,
as he who hath reasoned himself into that Opinion.
It will then by no means follow, that because this
or that Notion is a Prejudice, it must be therefore
false. The not distinguishing between Prejudices
and Errors, is a prevailing Oversight among our
modern Free-thinkers.</P>
<P>There may be, indeed, certain mere Prejudices
or Opinions, which having no Reasons either as∣signed
or assignable, to support them, are neverthess
entertained by the Mind, because they intruded be∣times
into it. Such may be supposed false, not be∣cause
they were early learned, or learned without
their Reasons; but because there are in truth no
Reasons to be given for them.</P>
<P>Certainly, if a Notion may be concluded false,
because it was early imbibed, or because it is with
most Men an Object of Belief rather than of
Knowledge, one may by the same Reasoning con∣clude
several Propositions of <HI>Euclid</HI> to be false. A
simple Apprehension of Conclusions as taken in
<PB N="62" REF="59"/>
themselves without the Deductions of Science, is
what falls to the Share of Mankind in general.
Religious Awe, the Precepts of Parents and
Masters, the Wisdom of Legislators, and the ac∣cumulated
Experience of Ages, supply the Place
of Proofs and Reasonings with the Vulgar of all
Ranks: I would say, that Discipline, national Con∣stitution,
and Laws human or divine, are so many
plain Land Marks, which guide them into the
Paths wherein it is presumed they ought to tread.</P>
<P>From what hath been premised, it plainly ap∣pears
that in the Bulk of Mankind, there are, and
must be Prejudices; that is, Opinions taken upon
Trust; or, in other Words, that there are Points
of Faith among all Men whatsoever, as well as
among Christians.</P>
<P>And, as it is evident, that the unthinking Part
of every Age, Sex, and Condition among us, must
necessarily receive Notions with the Submission of
Faith; so it is very reasonable, that they should
submit their Faith to the greatest Authorities human
and divine, the Law and the Gospel. But, if once
all Reverence for these be destroyed, our Pretenders
to moral Knowledge will have no Authority to
imbue the Multitude with such Notions as may
control their Appetites. From all which it follows,
that the modern Schemes of our Free-thinkers, who
pretend to separate Morality from Religion, how
rational soever they may seem to their Admirers,
are, in Truth and Effect, most irrational and per∣nicious
to civil Society.</P>
<P>Let any one, who thinks at all, consider the savage
State of undisciplined Men, whose Minds are
nurtured to no Doctrine, broke by no Instruction,
governed by no Principle. Let him at the same
Time reflect on a Society of Persons educated in
the Principles of our Church, formed betimes to
<PB N="63" REF="60"/>
fear God, to reverence their Superiors, to be grate∣ful
to their Benefactors, forgiving to their Ene∣mies,
just and charitable to all Men; and he will
then be able to judge of the Merits of those who
are so active to weed out the Prejudices of Edu∣cation.</P>
<P>Among the many wild Notions broached in these
giddy Times, it must be owned, that some of our
Declaimers against Prejudice have wrought them∣selves
into a Sort of Esteem for Savages, as a vir∣tuous
and unprejudiced People. In Proof of which,
they alledge their being free from many Vices
practised in civilized Nations. Now, it is very
true, among Savages there are few Instances to be
found of Luxury, Avarice, or Ambition; not that
the contrary Virtues take place, but because the
Opportunities and Faculties for such Vices, are want∣ing.
For the same Reason you do not see them in
Brutes.</P>
<P>What they esteem and admire in those Creatures,
is not Innocence, but Ignorance; it is not Virtue,
but Necessity. Give them but the Means of trans∣gressing,
and they know no Bounds. For Example:
Supply the Water-drinking Savage with strong
Liquor, and he shall be drunk for several Days and
Nights together. Again; we admit an unedu∣cated
Savage knows not how to supplant a Rival
with the refined Treachery of a Courtier; yet, if
you put his Foe once in his Power, you shall soon
see what a horrible Relish and Delight the Monster
hath in Cruelty.</P>
<P>Above all others, religious Notions, or if you
will, Prejudices, (since this, as hath been already
observed, detracts nothing from their Truth and
Usefulness) have the most Influence, they are the
strongest Curb from Vice, and the most effectual
<PB N="64" REF="61"/>
Spur to worthy Conduct. And indeed, whether
we consider the Reason of Things, or the Practice
of Men in all Times, we shall be satisfied, that
nothing truly great and good can enter into the
Heart of one attached to no Principles of Religion,
who believes no Providence, who neither fears Hell,
nor hopes for Heaven.</P>
<P>Punishments and Rewards have always had, and
always will have the greatest Weight with Men;
and the most considerable of both Kinds are pro∣posed
by Religion, the Duties whereof fall in with
the Views of the civil Magistrate; it undeniably
follows, that nothing can add more Strength to
a good and righteous Government than Religion.
Therefore it mainly concerns Governors to keep an
attentive Eye on the Religion of their Subjects.
And indeed, it is one Lesson to Magistrate and
People, Prince and Subject, <HI>Keep my Command∣ments
and live, and my Law as the Apple of thine
Eye.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PROV. Ch. vii. Ver. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>Although it is no Consequence from what hath
been said, that Men should be debarred the free
Use of Reason and Inquiry; yet, surely it will
follow, that without good Reason, a Man should
not reject those Notions which have been instilled
by the Laws and Education of his Country. And
even they who think they have such Reason, have
nevertheless no Right of dictating<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Though a Man's private Judgment be a Rule to himself, it will not thence follow, that he hath any Right to set up for a Rule to others.</NOTE> to others. It
is true, divine Authority is superior to all human
Prejudices, Institutions and Regards whatsoever.
And it is wise, although at the Risk of Liberty,
or Life, to obey God rather than Man. But our
<PB N="65" REF="62"/>
modern Reformers of Prejudice, have nothing to
plead<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">No Man can say he is obliged in Conscience, Honour, or Prudence, to insult the public Wisdom, or to ridicule the Laws under whose Protection he lives.</NOTE> of that kind.</P>
<P>There is no Magistrate so ignorant as not to
know that Power, physical Power, resides in the
People; but Authority is from Opinion, which
Authority is necessary to restrain and direct the
People's Power, and therefore Religion is the great
Stay and Support of a State. Every Religion that
inculcates Virtue, and discourageth Vice, is so far
of public Benefit. The Christian Religion doth
noth only this, but further makes every legal Con∣stitution
sacred by commanding our Submission
thereto. <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the higher
Powers,</HI> saith St. PAUL, <HI>for the Powers that be, are
ordained of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROM. Ch. xiii. Ver. 1.</NOTE>. And, in effect, for several Years
past, while the Reverence for our Church and Re∣ligion
hath been decaying and wearing off from
the Minds of Men, it may be observed, that Loy∣alty
hath in Proportion lost ground; and now the
very Word seems quite forgotten. Submission
for Conscience, as well as for Wrath, was once
reckoned an useful Lesson; but now, with other
good Lessons, is laid aside as an obsolete Preju∣dice.</P>
<P>That Prince or Magistrate, however great or
powerful, who thinks his own Authority suffi∣cient
to make him respected and obeyed, lies un∣der
a woful Mistake, and never fails to feel it sooner
or later. Obedience to all civil Power is rooted in
the religious Fear of God; it is propagated, pre∣served
and nourished by Religion. This makes
Men obey, not with Eye-Service, but in Sincerity
of Heart. Human Regards may restrain Men
<PB N="66" REF="63"/>
from open and penal Offences; but the Fear of
God is a Restraint from all Degrees of all Crimes,
however circumstanced. Take away this Stay and
Prop of Duty, this Root of civil Authority; and
all that was sustained by it, or grew from it, shall
soon languish. The Authority, the very Being of
the Magistrate, will prove a poor and precarious
Thing.</P>
<P>An inward Sense of the supreme Majesty of the
King of Kings, is the only Thing that can beget
and preserve a true Respect for subordinate Maje∣sty
in all the Degrees of Power, the first Link of
Authority being fixed at the Throne of God. But
in these our Days, that <HI>Majestas imperii,</HI> that Sa∣credness
of Character, which rooted in a religious
Principle, was the great Guard and Security of
the State, is through Want thereof become the
public Scorn. And indeed, what Hold can the
Prince or Magistrate have on the Conscience of
those who have no Conscience? How can he build
on the Principles of such as have no Principles?
Or how can he hope for Respect where God him∣self
is neglected?</P>
<P>It is manifest that no Prince upon Earth can
hope to govern well, or even to live easy and se∣cure,
much less respected by his People, if he do
not contribute by his Example and Authority, to
keep up in their Minds an awful Sense of Religion.
As for a moral Sense and moral Fitness, or eter∣nal
Relations, how insufficient those Things are
for establishing general and just Notions of Mora∣lity,
or for keeping Men within due Bounds, is
so evident from Fact and Experience, that I need
not now enter into a particular Disquisition about
them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> ALCIPHRON, Dial. III. and IV.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="64"/>
It must be owned, that the Claws of Rapine
and Violence, may in some Degree be pared and
blunted by the outward Polity of a State. But
should we not rather try, if possible, to pull them
quite out? The evil Effects of Wickedness may be
often redressed by public Justice. But would it
not be better to heal the Source, and by an in∣ward
Principle extirpate Wickedness from the
Heart, rather than depend altogether on human
Laws for preventing or redressing the bad Effects
thereof? <Q REND="inline">'I might (said the <HI>Chinese</HI> Doctor <HI>Confu∣cius</HI>)

other.'</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Scientia SIN. Lib. I. Fol. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>Too many in this Age of free Remarks and
Projects, are delighted with republican Schemes,
and imagine they might remedy whatever was
amiss, and render a People great and happy, meerly
by a new Plan or Form of Government. This
dangerous Way of Thinking and Talking, is grown
familiar, through the foolish<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Men forget that Liberty consists in a Mean, or that there is any other Extreme beside Tyranny.</NOTE> Freedom of the
Times. But alas! Those Men do not seem to
have touched either the true Cause or Cure of public
Evils. Be the Plan ever so excellent, or the Ar∣chitects
ever so able, yet no Man in his Wits would
undertake to build a Palace with meer Mud or Dirt.
There must be fit Materials; and without a religi∣ous
Principle, Men can never be fit Materials for
any Society, much less for a Republic. Religion
is the Centre, which unites, and the Cement which
connects the several Parts or Members of the poli∣tical
Body. Such it hath been held by all wise
<PB N="68" REF="65"/>
Men, from the remotest Times, down to our inge∣nious
Contemporaries; who, if they are in the
Right, it must be admitted that all the rest of the
World have been in the Wrong.</P>
<P>From the Knowledge of its being absolutely ne∣cessary
to the Government of a State, that the
Hearts and Minds of the People be inwardly imbued
with good Principles, <HI>Plato</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In PROTAGORA.</NOTE> tells, that <Q REND="inline">'<HI>Jupi∣ter,</HI>
to preserve the Race of Men from perishing,
sent <HI>Mercury</HI> with Orders to introduce Modesty
and Justice among them, as the firmest Ties of

subsist."</Q> And elsewhere, the same Author gives
it plainly as his Sense, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De legibus, Lib. VIII.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">'Concerning those
great Duties which Mens Appetites and Passions
render difficult, it should seem rather the Work
of God to provide, than of human Legislators,

You see how agreeable the <HI>Mosaic</HI> and Chris∣tian
Institutions are to the Wishes of the wisest
Heathen.</P>
<P><HI>Moses,</HI> indeed, doth not insist on a future State,
the common Basis of all political Institutions. Nor
do other Lawgivers make a particular mention of
all Things necessary, but suppose some Things as
generally known or believed. The Belief of a future
State, (which it is manifest the <HI>Jews</HI> were possessed
of, long before the Coming of CHRIST) seems to
have obtained among the <HI>Hebrews</HI> from primaeval
Tradition; which might render it unnecessary for
<HI>Moses</HI> to insist on that Article. But the <HI>Sadducee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and <HI>Epicureans</HI> had, in Progress of Time, gone so
far towards rooting out this ancient and origina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="69" REF="66"/>
Sentiment, that it was in Danger of being lost,
had it not been taught and promulgated in a new
Light by our blessed SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>But many among us, who would pass for Asser∣tors
of Truth and Liberty, are accustomed to rail
at this, and all other established Opinions, as Preju∣dices
which People are taught whether they will or
no, and before they are able to distinguish whether
they are right or wrong. These Lovers of Truth
would do well to consider, that in political, moral
and religious Matters, the Opinions of the Vulgar,
whether they go in Coaches, or walk on Foot, are
for the most part Prejudices; and are so like to be
whatever Side of the Question they embrace; whe∣ther
they follow the old Maxims of the Religion
of their Country, or the modern Instructions of
their new Masters. I have already observed, that
a Point's being useful, and inculcated betimes, can
be no Argument of its Falshood, even although it
should be a Prejudice; far otherwise, Unity and
Truth are not to be divided; the general Good of
Mankind, being the Rule or Measure of moral
Truth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> ALCIPHRON, Dial. I. Sect. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall now add, that it is to be apprehended,
many of those who are the most forward to banish
Prejudices, would be the first to feel the Want of
them. It is even pitiful to think what would be
come of certain moderate Declaimers on that Arti∣cle,
were Prejudice really set aside, and were all Men
to be weighed in the exact Scale of Merit, and con∣sidered
in Proportion only to their intrinsic Worth.
Some Prejudices are grounded in Truth, Reason and
Nature. Such are the Respects which are paid to
Knowledge, Learning, Age, Honesty and Cou∣rage,
in all civilized Countries. Others are purely
<PB N="70" REF="67"/>
the Effect of particular Constitutions; such are the
Respects, Rights and Preeminences ascribed to
some Men by their Fellow-Subjects, on account of
their Birth and Quality; which, in the great Em∣pires
of <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> pass for nothing; and will
pass for nothing elsewhere, as soon as Men have
got rid of their Prejudices, and learned to des∣pise
the Constitutions of their Country. It may
behove those who are concerned, to reflect on this
betimes.</P>
<P>GOD, comprehending within himself the Be∣ginning,
End and Middle of all Things and Times,
exerts his Energy throughout the whole Creation.
He never ceaseth to influence by Instinct, by the
Light of Nature, by his declared Will. And it
is the duty of Magistrates and Lawgivers, to culti∣vate
and encourage those divine Impressions in the
Minds of all Men under their Care. We are not
to think, it is the Work of God, and therefore not
to be seconded by human Care. Far otherwise, for
that very reason it claims our utmost Care and Di∣ligence,
it being the indispensible Duty of all good
Men, throughout the whole Course of their Lives,
to co-operate with the Designs of Providence. In
Religion, as in Nature, God doth somewhat, and
somewhat is to be done on the Part of Man. He
causes the Earth to bring forth Materials for Food
and Raiment; but human Industry must improve,
prepare, and properly apply both the one and the
other, or Mankind may perish with Cold and Hun∣ger.
And according to this fame Analogy,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It will be sufficient, if such Analogy appears between the Dispensations of Grace and Nature, as may make it probable to suppose them derived from the same Author.</P>
<P>ALCIPHRON Dial. VI. Sect. 31.</P></NOTE> the
Principles of Piety and Religion, the Things that
belong to our Salvation, although originally and
<PB N="71" REF="68"/>
primarily the Work of God, yet require the Pro∣tection
of human Government, as well as the Fur∣therance
and Aid of all wise and good Men.</P>
<P>And if Religion in all Governments be necessa∣ry,
yet it seems to be so more especially in Monar∣chies:
Forasmuch as the frugal Manners, and more
equal Fortunes in Republics, do not so much in∣flame
Mens Appetites, or afford such Power or
Temptation to Mischief, as the high Estate and great
Wealth of Nobles under a King. Therefore al∣though
the Magistrate (as was already observed)
hath for his peculiar Object, the temporal Well-be∣ing
of the State; yet this will by no means exempt
him from a due Concern for the Religion of his
Country.</P>
<P>What was the Sense of our Ancestors on this
Point, appears throughout the whole Constitution
of these Kingdoms; and in order to justify this
Constitution, and the Wisdom of those who framed
it, I shall crave leave to make use of some unsus∣pected
Testimonies, ancient and modern, which will
shew, that the public Care of a national Religion,
hath been always a most principal Point in the Es∣teem
of wise Men, however run down by the pre∣vailing
Licence of our Times.</P>
<P>The first Testimnny I shall produce, is that of
<HI>Zaleucus,</HI> the famous Lawgiver of the <HI>Locrians;</HI>
who, in his Preamble to his Laws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STOBAEUS de leg. &amp; consuet. Ser. 145.</NOTE> begins with
Religion, laying it down as the Corner-stone, or
Foundation of his whole Superstructure, <Q REND="inline">'That

He further admonishes those who are difficult
to persuade, <Q REND="inline">'To bethink themselves of God's

<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Historians and Poets do so abound
with Passages ascribing the Successes of their Govern∣ment
<PB N="73" REF="70"/>
to Religion, and its Declension to the Want
or Neglect thereof, that it may seem impertinent
to enter into a Detail of what every School-Boy
knows.</P>
<P>To come from ancient to modern Authority,
<HI>Machiavel</HI> himself, represents Religion as absolute∣ly
necessary to maintain civil Order and Govern∣ment.
He observes, that for many Years, there
was a most awful Sense of Religion in the old <HI>Ro∣mans;</HI>
and that this did much facilitate their great
Undertakings. He likewise observes, and shews by
divers Instances, that the <HI>Romans</HI> were more afraid
to break an Oath, than to transgress the Laws;
and that those Things which even the Love of their
Country and Constitution could not bring them to,
they were brought to through a Sense of Religion.
Upon the whole, he concludes, that old <HI>Rome</HI>
was more obliged to <HI>Numa,</HI> who established a national
Religion, than to <HI>Romulus</HI> himself, the Founder
of that State.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DISCORSI, Lib. I. Cap. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>And here by the by, I shall take notice, that
some may imagine, the various Forms and Institu∣tions
of Religion ought to unsettle Mens Minds,
with regard to the Truth and Certainty of any.
But this Matter rightly considered, will, I think,
produce a contrary Effect. It sheweth, indeed, that
Men groping out their Way by the dim Twilight
of Nature did only approach, some nearer, some
farther off, while all were short of the Truth. But
then sheweth likewise, upon the whole, and in gene∣ral,
that Religion is so natural to our Minds, so
useful to Society, and of so necessary Importance
to the World, as might well prove its Truth, and
render it worthy of the divine Care to propagate by

of God.</P>

<P>It would be no hard Matter to produce a Cloud
of Testimonies in behalf of a national Religion,
from the most eminent of our own Writers; but I
shall content myself with adding one only, and that
from a very unsuspected Writer, Mr. <HI>Harrington,</HI>
Author of the <HI>Oceana,</HI> who shews that to be just
and fair, which others have shewed to be expedi∣ent.
<Q REND="inline">'<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 27. First Edit.</NOTE> A Man (saith he) that pleading for Li∣berty

<P>All these Authorities are taken from thinking
Men, and able Politicians, none of which can be
supposed to say what he did not really think; and
it had been very easy to have increased the Num∣ber.
But, I am sorry, I was obliged to mention any
at all, in proof of so plain and fundamental a Point
as that of a national Religion. It is indeed, a
<PB N="75" REF="72"/>
shameful Necessity we lie under, of proving at this
Time of Day the first Elements, I will not say of
Christianity, but even of natural Light, from Rea∣sons
and from Authorities. The Spirit of the
Times hath rendered this unavoidable.</P>
<P>If it should be asked after all, how comes it
then to pass, that the fashionable and prevailing
Maxims among our Betters, in a neighbouring Na∣tion,
should run directly counter to all such Rea∣sons
and Authorities? I will answer this Question,
by asking when were our Neighbours known to
abound to that Degree in Highwaymen, Murderers,
House-breakers, Incendiaries? When did such Num∣bers
lay violent Hands on themselves? When was
there such a general and indecent Contempt of
whatever is esteemed sacred, in the State as well as
the Church? When were there known among
them such public Frauds, such open Confederacies
in Villany, as the present Age hath produced?
When were they lower in Esteem of Mankind, more
divided at home, or more insulted abroad?</P>
<P>We of this Land have a fatal Tendency to over∣look
the good Qualities, and imitate whatever is
amiss in those whom we respect. This leads me to
make some Remarks on the modern Spirit of Re∣formation,
that works so strongly in both these
Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Freedom of Thought is the general Plea and Cry
of the Age; and we all grant, that thinking is the
Way to know; and the more real Knowledge there
is in the Land, the more likely it will be to thrive.
We are not therefore against Freedom of Thought,
but we are against those unthinking, overbearing
People,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It is not Reason candidly proposed that offends, but the Reviling, Insulting, Ridiculing of the national Laws and Re∣ligion, all this profiteth for Free-thinking, and must needs be offensive to all reasonable Men.</NOTE> who, in these odd Times, under that Pre∣tence,
<PB N="76" REF="73"/>
set up for Reformers, and new Molders of
the Constitution. We declare against those, who
would seduce ignorant and unexperinced Persons
from the Reverence they owe to the Laws and Re∣ligion
of their Country; and under the Notion of
extirpating Prejudices, would erase from their Minds
all Impressions of Piety and Virtue, in order to in∣troduce
Prejudices of another Kind, destructive of
Society.</P>
<P>We esteem it a horrible Thing, to laugh at the
Apprehensions of a future State, with the Author
of the <HI>Charasterictics</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. Miscel. III. C. 2.</NOTE>; or with him who wrote
the <HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> to maintain that <HI>moral Virtues
are the political Offspring which Flattery begot upon
Pride</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Inquiry into the Origin of moral Virtue. Ed. 6. p. 37.</NOTE>; that <HI>in Morals there is no greater Certainty,
than in Fashions of Dress</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Author's Re∣marks on his Fable of the Bees, p. 379.</NOTE>; <HI>that,</HI> indeed, <HI>the Doctrine

who setting out upon opposite Principles, are calcu∣lated
to draw all Mankind, by flattering either their
Vanity or their Passions, into one or other Sys∣tem.
And yet, the People among whom such
Books are published, wonder how it comes to
pass, that the civil Magistrate daily loseth his Au∣thority,
that the Laws are trampled upon, and
the Subject in constant Fear of being robbed, or
murdered, or having his House burnt over his
Head?</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="74"/>
It may be presumed, that the Science of finding
Fault, which above all others is easiest to learn, suits
best with a modern Education. Too many there
are of better Fortunes than Understandings, who
have made the Inquiry after Truth, a very small
Part of their Care: These see somewhat, but not
enough. It were to be wished, they knew either
less or more. One Thing it is evident they do not
know; to wit, that while they rail at Prejudice,
they are undoing themselves: They do not com∣prehend,
(what hath been before hinted) that their
whole Figure, their political Existence, is owing to
certain vulgar Prejudices, in Favour of Birth,
Title, or Fortune, which add nothing of real
Worth either to Mind or Body; and yet, cause
the most worthless Person to be respected.</P>
<P>Feedom of Thought is the Prerogative of hu∣man
Kind; it is a Quality inherent in the very
Nature of a thinking Being. Nothing is more
evident, than that every one can think his own
Way, in spite of any outward Force or Power
whatsoever. It is therefore ridiculous for any Man
to declaim in Defence of a Privilege, which can∣not
be denied or taken from him. But this will
not infer a boundless Freedom of Speech,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Is there no Difference between indulging scrupulous Con∣sciences, and tolerating public Deriders of all Conscience and Religion?</NOTE> an open
Contempt of Laws, and a prescribing from private
Judgment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">A Man who is himself permitted to follow his own pri∣vate Judgment, cannot well complain, although he may not set it up as a public Rule.</NOTE> against public Authority, Things never
borne in any well-ordered State; and which make
the crying Distemper of our Times.</P>
<P>The Constitution of these Kingdoms, hath been
one while over-heated by the indiscreet Zeal of one
Set of Men: Again, it hath been cold and lifeless,
<PB N="78" REF="75"/>
through the Indifference of another.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">There is a Medium in Things, which wise Men find out, while the unwise are always blundering in Extremes.</NOTE> We have
alternately felt the furious Effects of Superstition
and Fanaticism; and our present impending Danger,
is from the setting up of private Judgment, or an
inward Light, in Opposition to human and divine
Laws. Such an inward conceited Principle always
at work, and proceeding gradually and steadily,
may be sufficient to dissolve any human Fabric of
Polity or civil Government. To pretend to be
wiser than the Laws, hath never been suffered
in any wise State, saith <HI>Aristotle.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhet. Lib. I. Cap. 15.</NOTE> And indeed,
what wise State would encourage or endure a Spirit
of Opposition,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Reason modestly pleading from a conscientious Principle, hath nothing cruel to apprehend from our Laws, and I hope it never will. At the same time, it must be allowed, that every Plea against Law, ought to be very meek and modest.</NOTE> publicly to operate against its
own Decrees? who can say to such a Spirit, <HI>Thus
far shalt thou come, and no farther?</HI></P>
<P>The Magistrate, perhaps, may not be sufficiently
aware, that those pretended Advocates for private
Light and free Thought, are in reality seditious
Men, who set up themselves against national Laws
and Constitutions. And yet, one would think,
all Mankind might see, that the Spirit which pre∣vails
against the Church and Religion, proceeds
from an Opposition rather to the Laws of the Land,
than to the Gospel. Men quarrel not so vehemently
against Articles of Faith themselves, as against the
establishing of such Matters; which is the sole
Effect of Law and the supreme Power. It clearly
follows, the Freedom pleaded for is not so much
Freedom of Thought against the Doctrines of the
Gospel, as Freedom of Speech and Action against
<PB N="79" REF="76"/>
the Laws of the Land. It is strange, that those
who are not blind in other Matters, should yet not
see this; or, that seeing it, they should not discern
the Consequences thereof.</P>
<P>I am sensible, that whatever looks like a Re∣straint
on Freedom of Inquiry, must be very disa∣greeable
to all reasoning and inquisitive Men. But
against this, I have said nothing.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The profane and lawless Scorner is one Thing, and the modest Inquirer after Truth another.</NOTE> On the con∣trary,
I will freely own, a judicious and impartial
Search after Truth, is the most valuable Employ∣ment
of the Mind. Those who have the Talents,
and will be at the Pains, cannot do better than en∣gage
in that noble Pursuit. But those who are not
qualified by Age or Education; those who have
neither Disposition nor Leisure, nor Faculties to dig
in the Mine of Truth themselves, must take it as
retailed out by others. I see no Remedy. GOD
who knows the Opportunities of every Man, re∣quires
Impossibilities from no Man. And where
there is a sincere Love of Truth and Virtue, the
Grace of GOD can easily supply the Defect of hu∣man
Means.</P>
<P>It hath been before observed, and shewed at large,
that the Bulk of Mankind must have their Minds
betimes imbued with good and wholsom Notions
or Principles, by their Parents, Pastors, and Tutors,
or else bad Notions, hurtful to themselves and
others, will undoubtedly take possession thereof.
Such bad Notions have, for several Years past, been
propagated with uncommon Industry in these
Kingdoms: They now bring forth Fruit every Day
more and more abundant. It is to be feared, that
what hath been long ripening, is now near ripe.
Many are the Signs and Tokens. He that runs,
may read.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="77"/>
But there cannot be a higher, or more flagrant
Symptom of the Madness of our Times, than
that execrable Fraternity of Blasphemers, lately set
up within this City of <HI>Dublin.</HI> Blasphemy against
GOD, is a great Crime against the State. But that
a Set of Men should, in open Contempt of the
Laws, make this very Crime their Profession,
distinguish themselves by a peculiar Name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Blasters.</NOTE>, and
form a distinct Society, whereof the proper and
avowed Business shall be, to shock all serious
Christians by the most impious and horrid Blas∣phemies,
uttered in the most public Manner: This
surely must alarm all thinking Men. It is a new
Thing under the Sun reserved for our worthy Times
and Country.</P>
<P>It is no common Blasphemy I speak of: It is not
simple Cursing and Swearing: It is not the Effect
either of Habit or Surprise; but a Train of studied
deliberate Indignities against the divine Majesty;
and those of so black and hellish a Kind, as the
Tongues alone which uttered them, can duly
characterize and express. This is no speculative
Heresy, no remote or doubtful Inference from an
Author's Tenets. It is a direct and open Attack on
GOD himself. It is such a calm premeditated Insult
upon Religion, Law, and the very Light of Na∣ture,
that there is no Sect or Nation of Men,
whether Christians, Jews, Mahometans, or even
civilized Heathens, that would not be struck with
Horror and Amazement at the Thought of it, and
that would not animadvert<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">They (if there be any such) who think to serve the Re∣formation, by joining with Blasters and Devil-worshippers in a Plea for Licence, are in truth a Scandal and Reproach to the Protestant Cause.</NOTE> on its Authors with
the utmost Severity.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="78"/>
Deliberate, atheistical Blasphemy, is of all Crimes
most dangerous to the Public, inasmuch as it opens
the Door to all other Crimes, and virtually contains
them all. A religious Awe and Fear of GOD, be∣ing
(as we have already observed) the Centre that
unites, and the Cement that connects all human
Society. He, who makes it his Business, to lessen
or root out from the Minds of Men this Principle,
doth in effect, endeavour to fill his Country with
Highwaymen, Housebreakers, Murderers, fraudulent
Dealers, perjured Witnesses, and every other Pest of
Society. Therefore, it would be the greatest Cruelty
to our Children, Neighbours, and Country, to con∣nive
at such a Crime; a Crime! which hath no
natural Passion or Temptation to plead for it, but is
the pure Effect of an abandoned Impudence in
Wickedness; and, perhaps, of a mistaken Hope,
that the Laws and Magistrates are asleep.</P>
<P>The Question is not now, whether Religion shall
be established by Law: The Thing is already done,
(and done with good Reason, as appeareth from the
Premises) but whether a Reverence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">They who plead a Right to contradict the Laws, can pretend none for doing it with Insolence or Disrespect.</NOTE> for the Laws
shall be preserved. Religion, considered as a System
of saving Truths, hath its Sanction from Heaven;
its Rewards and Penalties are divine. But Religion,
as useful and necessary to Society, hath been wisely
established by Law; and so established, and wrought
into the very Frame and Principles of our Govern∣ment,
is become a main Part of the civil Consti∣tution.
Our Laws, are the Laws of a Christian
Country: Our Government hath been constituted
and modelled by Christians; and is still admini∣stered
and maintained by Men professing Belief in
CHRIST. Can it then be supposed, that impious
<PB N="82" REF="79"/>
Men shall with Impunity invent and<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">To make the Cause of such Men the Cause of Liberty or Toleration, would be monstrous. A Man is not suffered pub∣licly to blaspheme, therefore he may not think freely: A profane Miscreant is not indulged in the public Worship of the Devil, therefore a conscientious Person may not serve God his own Way: Is not this absurd?</NOTE> publicly
utter the most horrid Blasphemies; and at the same
Time, the whole Constitution not be endangered?
Or can it be supposed, that Magistrates, or Men
invested with Power, should look on, and see the
most sacred Part of our Constitution trampled under
foot, and yet imagine their own Dignity and Au∣thority
to be secure, which rest intirely thereupon?
I will venture to say, that whoever is a wise Man,
and a Lover of his Country, will not only be
solicitous to preserve the Honour of GOD sacred
and intire; he will even discourage that prevailing
Prejudice against the Dispensers of GOD'S Word,
the Teachers of those salutary Doctrines, without
which the Public cannot thrive or subsist. He will
be no Contemner, not even of those Rites and
Ordinances enjoined by Law, as necessary to im∣print
and retain a Sense of Religion in the Minds
of Men. He will extend his Care to the Out∣works,
as knowing that when these are gone, it
may be difficult to preserve the rest.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the vain Assertion of those
Men, who would justify the present, by saying <HI>All
Times are alike,</HI> it is most evident, that the Ma∣gistrates,
the Laws, the very Constitution of these
Realms, have lost no small Share of their Autho∣rity
and Reverence, since this great growth and
spreading of impious Principles. Whatever be the
Cause, the Effect is apparent. Whether we ascribe
it to the natural Course of Things, or to a just
Judgment upon those, who, having been careless
<PB N="83" REF="80"/>
to preserve a due Sense of the divine Authority,
have seen and shall see their own despised.</P>
<P><HI>Darius,</HI> a Heathen Prince, made a Decree, that
in every Dominion of his Kingdom, Men should
tremble and fear before GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. Ch. VI. Ver. 26.</NOTE><HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
likewise, another Heathen, made a Decree, that
every People, Nation and Language which spoke
any Thing amiss against GOD, should be cut in
Pieces, and their Houses made a Dunghill.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DAN. Ch. III. Ver. 29.</NOTE> And
if these Things were done in <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Babylon,</HI>
surely it may be expected, that impious Blasphemers
against GOD and his Worship, should, at least, be
discouraged and put out of Countenance in these
Christian Countries. Now, a constant Course of
Disfavour from Men in Authority, would prove a
most effectual Check to all such Miscreants. When
therefore they are public and bold in their Blasphemies,
this is no small Reflexion on those who
might check them if they would.</P>
<P>It is not so much the Execution of the Laws, as
the Countenance of those in Authority, that is
wanting to the Maintenance of Religion. If Men
of Rank and Power, who have a Share in dis∣tributing
Justice, and a Voice in the public Councils,
shall be observed to neglect divine Worship them∣selves,
it must needs be a great Temptation for
others to do the same. But if they, and their Fa∣milies,
should set a good Example, it may be pre∣sumed
that Men of less Figure would be disposed
to follow it. Fashions are always observed to de∣scend,
and People are generally fond of being in
the Fashion: Whence one would be apt to suspect,
the prevailing Contempt of GOD'S Word, and Estrangement
from his House, to a Degree that
<PB N="84" REF="81"/>
was never known in any Christian Country, must
take its Rise from the Irreligion and bad Example
of those who are stiled <HI>the better Sort.</HI></P>
<P>Offences must come, but Woe be to him, by
whom the Offence cometh. A Man who is in∣trusted
with Power and Influence in his Country,
hath much to answer for, if Religion and Virtue
suffer through Want of his Authority and Coun∣tenance.
But in Case he should, by the Vanity
of his Discourse, his Favour to wicked Men, or
his own apparent Neglect of all religious Duties,
countenance what he ought to condemn, and au∣thorize
by his own Example what he ought to punish;
such a one, whatever he may pretend, is in Fact
a bad Patriot, a bad Citizen, and a bad Subject, as
well as a bad Christian.</P>
<P>Our Prospect is very terrible, and the Symptoms
grow stronger every Day. The Morals of a People
are in this, like their Fortunes; when they feel a
national Shock, the worst doth not shew itself
immediately. Things make a Shift to subsist for
a Time, on the Credit of old Notions and dying
Opinions. But the Youth born and brought up
in wicked Times, without any Bias to Good from
early Principle or instilled Opinion, when they
grow ripe must be Monsters indeed. And it is to
be feared, that Age of Monsters is not far off.</P>
<P>Whence this Impiety-springs, by what means it
gains ground among us, and how it may be
remedied, are Matters that deserve the Attention
of all those who have the Power and the Will to
serve their Country. And although many Things
look like a Prelude to some general Ruin; although
it is much to be apprehended, we shall be worse
before we are better; yet who knows what may
ensue, if all Persons in Power, from the supreme
Executor of the Law, down to a petty Constable,
<PB N="85" REF="82"/>
would, in their several Stations, behave themselves
like Men, truly conscious and mindful, that the
Authority they are clothed with, is but a derivative
Ray from the supreme Authority of Heaven?
This may not a little contribute to stem that Tor∣rent,
which from small Beginnings, and under
specious Pretences, hath grown to such a Head, and
daily gathers Force more and more to that Degree,
as threatens a general Inundation and Destruction
of these Realms.</P>

<P>BE not startled, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> to find yourselves
addressed to by one of a different Communion.
We are indeed (to our Shame be it spoken) more
inclined to hate for those Articles wherein we differ,
than to love one another for those wherein we agree.
But if we cannot extinguish, let us at least suspend
our Animosities, and forgetting our religious Feuds,
consider ourselves in the amiable Light of Country∣men
and Neighbours. Let us for once turn our
Eyes on those Things, in which we have one com∣mon
Interest. Why should Disputes about Faith
interrupt the Duties of civil Life? or the different
Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the
same Steps on Earth? Do we not inhabit the same
Spot of Ground, breathe the same Air, and live
under the same Government? why then should we
not conspire in one and the same Design, to pro∣mote
the common Good of our Country?</P>
<P>We are all agreed about the Usefulness of Meat,
Drink, and Clothes, and without Doubt, we all
sincerely wish our poor Neighbours were better
supplied with them. Providence and Nature have
<PB N="90" REF="85"/>
done their Part: no Country is better qualified to
furnish the Necessaries of Life, and yet no People
are worse provided. In vain is the Earth fertile,
and the Climate benign, if human Labour be
wanting. Nature supplies the Materials, which
Art and Industry improve to the Use of Man, and
it is the Want of this Industry that occasions all our
other Wants.</P>
<P>The Public hath endeavoured to excite and
encourage this useful Virtue. Much hath been
done; but whether it be from the Heaviness of
the Climate, or from the <HI>Spanish,</HI> or <HI>Scythian</HI> Blood
that runs in their Veins, or whatever else may be
the Cause, there still remains in the Natives of
this Island a remarkable Antipathy to Labour. You,
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> can alone conquer their innate hereditary
Sloth. Do you then, as you love your Country,
exert yourselves.</P>
<P>You are known to have great Influence on the
Minds of your People, be so good as to use this
Influence for their Benefit. Since other Methods
fail, try what <HI>you</HI> can do. <HI>Be instant in Season, out
of Season, reprove, rebuke, exhort.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</NOTE> Make them
thoroughly sensible of the Sin and Folly of Sloth.
Shew your Charity in clothing the naked and feed∣ing
the hungry, which you may do by the mere
Breath of your Mouths. Give me leave to tell
you, that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in
their Power to do Good on easier Terms, with
more Advantage to others, and less Pains or Loss
to themselves. Your Flocks are of all others,
most disposed to follow Directions, and of all others
want them most; and indeed what do they not want?</P>
<P>The House of an <HI>Irish Peasant</HI> is the Cave of
Poverty; within, you see a Pot and a little Straw;
<PB N="91" REF="86"/>
without, a Heap of Children tumbling on the
Dunghill. Their Fields and Gardens are a lively
Counterpart of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Description in the Pro∣verbs;
<HI>I went,</HI> saith that wise King, <HI>by the Field
of the slothful, and by the Vineyard of the Man void
of Understanding, and lo! it was all grown over with
Thorns, and Nettles had covered the Face thereof, and
the Stone Wall thereof was broken down</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xxiv. ver. 30, 31.</NOTE>. In every
Road the ragged Ensigns of Poverty are displayed;
you often meet Caravans of Poor, whole Families
in a Drove, without Clothes to cover, or Bread to
feed them, both which might be easily procured by
moderate Labour. They are encouraged in this
vagabond Life by the miserable Hospitality they
meet with in every Cottage, whose Inhabitants
expect the same kind Reception in their Turn,
when they become Beggars themselves; Beggary
being the last Refuge of these improvident Crea∣tures.</P>
<P>If I seem to go out of my Province, or to pre∣scribe
to those who must be supposed to know their
own Business, or to paint the lower Inhabitants of
this Land in no very pleasing Colours, you will
candidly forgive a well meant Zeal, which obligeth
me to say Things, rather useful than agreeable, and
to lay open the Sore in order to heal it.</P>
<P>But whatever is said must be so taken, as not to
reflect on Persons of Rank and Education, who
are no way inferior to their Neighbours; nor yet
to include all even of the lowest Sort, though it
may well extend to the Generality, of those especially
in the <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Parts of the Kingdom,
where the <HI>British</HI> Manners have less prevailed. We
take our Notions from what we see, mine are a
faithful Transcript from Originals about me.</P>

The <HI>Scythians</HI> were noted for Wandering, and
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Sloth and Pride; our <HI>Irish</HI> are

more abject than <HI>Negroes.</HI> The <HI>Negroes</HI> in our Plan∣tations

<P>Having long observed and bewailed this wretched
State of my Countrymen, and the Insufficiency of
several Methods set on foot to reclaim them, I have
recourse to <HI>your Reverences,</HI> as the <HI>dernier Resort.</HI>
Make them to understand that you have their In∣terest
at heart, that you persuade them to work for
their own Sakes, and that GOD hath ordered Mat∣ters
so as that, they who will not work for them∣selves,
must work for others. The Terrors of
Debt, Slavery, and Famine should, one would
think, drive the most slothful to Labour. Make
them sensible of these Things, and that the Ends
of Providence and Order of the World require
Industry in human Creatures. <HI>Man goeth forth to

<HI>Idle Man</HI> is of no use, it follows, that he hath no
Right to a Subsistence. <HI>Let them work,</HI> saith the
<HI>Apostle, and eat their own Bread</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Thess. ch. iii. ver. 12.</NOTE>; not Bread got
by Begging, not Bread earn'd by the Sweat of
other Men; but their own Bread, that which is got
by their own Labour. <HI>Then shalt thou eat the
Labour of thine Hands,</HI> saith the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> to which
he adds, <HI>Happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with
thee</HI><NOTE N="‖‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxxxviii. ver. 2.</NOTE>; intimating, that to work and enjoy the
Fruits thereof is a great Blessing.</P>
<P>A slothful Man's Imagination is apt to dress up
Labour in a horrible Mask; but horrible as it is,
Idleness is more to be dreaded, and a Life of
<PB N="94" REF="89"/>
Poverty (its necessary Consequence) is far more
painful. It was the Advice of <HI>Pythagoras, To choose
the best kind of Life,</HI> for that Use would render it
agreeable, reconciling Men even to the roughest
Exercise. By Practice, Pains become at first easy,
and in the Progress pleasant; and this is so true,
that whoever examines Things will find, there can
be no such Thing as a happy Life without Labour,
and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands,
must in his own Defence labour with his Brains.</P>
<P>Certainly, planting and tilling the Earth is an
Exercise not less pleasing than useful; it takes the
Peasant from his smoky Cabin, into the fresh Air
and the open Field, rendering his Lot far more de∣sirable
than that of the Sluggard, who lies in the
Straw, or sits whole Days by the Fire.</P>
<P>Convince your People that not only Pleasure in∣vites,
but Necessity also drives them to labour. If
you have any Compassion for these poor Creatures,
put them in mind how many of them perished in
a late memorable Distress, through want of that
provident Care against a hard Season, observable
not only in all other Men, but even in irrational
Animals. Set before their Eyes in lively Colours,
their own indigent and sordid Lives, compared
with those of other People, whose Industry hath
procured them hearty Food, warm Clothes, and
decent Dwellings. Make them sensible what a Re∣proach
it is, that a Nation which makes so great
Pretensions to Antiquity, and is said to have
flourished many Ages ago in Arts and Learning,
should in these our Days turn out a lazy, destitute,
and degenerate Race.</P>
<P>Raise your Voices, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> exert your
Influence, shew your Authority over the Multitude,
by engaging them to the Practice of an honest
Industry, a Duty necessary to all, and required in all,
<PB N="95" REF="90"/>
whether <HI>Protestants,</HI> or <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> whether
<HI>Christians, Jews,</HI> or <HI>Pagans.</HI> Be so good among
other Points to find room for <HI>This,</HI> than which none
is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your
Hearers, nor consequently deserves to be more
amply, or frequently insisted on.</P>
<P>Many and obvious are the Motives that recom∣mend
this Duty. Upon a Subject so copious, you
can never be at a loss for something to say. And
while by these Means you rescue your Countrymen
from Want and Misery, you will have the Satis∣faction
to behold your Country itself improved.
What Pleasure must it give you to see these waste
and wild Scenes, these naked Ditches, and miserable
Hovels, exchanged for fine Plantations, rich
Meadows, well-tilled Fields, and neat Dwellings;
to see People well fed, and well clad, instead of
famished, ragged Scarecrows; and those very Per∣sons
tilling the Fields that used to beg in the Streets.</P>
<P>Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterprise
to frighten you from attempting it. It must be
confessed a Habit of Industry is not at once intro∣duced;
Neighbour, nevertheless, will emulate
Neighbour, and the Contagion of good Example
will spread as surely as of bad, though perhaps not
so speedily. It may be hoped, there are many that
would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner
of Life to take Pains, especially when they observe
it to be attained by the Industry of their Neigh∣bours,
in no Sort better qualified than themselves.</P>
<P>If the same gentle Spirit of Sloth did not sooth
our Squires as well as Peasants, one would imagine
there should be no idle Hands among us. Alas!
how many Incentives to Industry offer themselves
in this Island, crying aloud to the Inhabitants for
Work? Roads to be repaired, Rivers made navi∣gable,
Fisheries on the Coasts, Mines to be wrought,
<PB N="96" REF="91"/>
Plantations to be raised, Manufactures improved,
and, above all, Lands to be tilled and sowed with
all Sorts of Grain.</P>
<P>When so many Circumstances provoke and ani∣mate
your People to Labour, when their private
Wants, and the Necessities of the Public, when the
Laws, the Magistrates, and the very Country calls
upon them, you cannot think it becomes you alone
to be silent, or hindmost in every Project for pro∣moting
the public Good. Why should you, whose
Influence is greatest, be least active? why should
you, whose Words are most likely to prevail, say
least in the common Cause?</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be said the Discouragements at∣tending
those of your Communion are a Bar against
all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable In∣dustry.
Men are stirred up to labour by the Pro∣spect
of bettering their Fortunes, by getting Estates,
or Employments; but those who are limited in the
Purchase of Estates, and excluded from all civil Em∣ployments,
are deprived of those Spurs to Industry.</P>
<P>To this it may be answered, that admitting these
Considerations do, in some measure, damp In∣dustry
and Ambition in Persons of a certain Rank,
yet they can be no Let to the Industry of poor
People, or supply an Argument against endeavouring
to procure Meat, Drink, and Clothes. It is not
proposed, that you sould persuade the better Sort
to acquire Estates, or qualify themselves for becom∣ing
Magistrates; but only that you should set the
lowest of the People at Work, to provide them∣selves
with Necessaries, and supply the Wants of
Nature.</P>
<P>It will be alledged in Excuse of their Idleness,
that the Country People want Encouragement to
labour, as not having a Property in the Lands.
There is small Encouragement, say you, for them
<PB N="97" REF="92"/>
to build, or plant upon another's Land, wherein
they have only a temporary Interest. To which I
answer, that Life itself is but temporary; that all
Tenures are not of the same Kind; that the Case
of our <HI>English</HI> and the original <HI>Irish</HI> is equal in this
Respect; and that the true <HI>Aborigines,</HI> or natural
<HI>Irish</HI> are noted for Want of Industry in improving
even on their own Lands, whereof they have both
Possession and Property.</P>
<P>How many industrious Persons are there in all
civilized Countries, without any Property in Lands,
or any Prospect of Estates, or Employments?
Industry never fails to reward her Votaries. There
is no one but can earn a little, and little added to
little makes a Heap. In this fertile and plentiful
Island, none can perish for Want but the Idle
and Improvident. None who have Industry, Fru∣gality,
and Foresight, but may get into tolerable,
if not wealthy Circumstances. Are not all Trades
and Manufactures open to those of your Commu∣nion?
have you not the same free Use, and may
you not make the same Advantage of Fairs and
Markets as other Men? do you pay higher Duties,
or are you liable to greater Impositions than your
fellow Subjects? and are not the public Praemiums
and Encouragements given indifferently to Artists
of all Communions? have not, in Fact, those of
your Communion a very great Share of the Com∣merce
of this Kingdom in their Hands? and is not
more to be got by this than by purchasing Estates,
or possessing civil Employments, whose Incomes are
often attended with large Expences?</P>
<P>A tight House, warm Apparel, and wholsom
Food are sufficient Motives to labour. If all had
them, we should be a flourishing Nation. And if
those who take pains may have them, those who
will not take pains are not to be pitied; they are to
<PB N="98" REF="93"/>
be looked on and treated as Drones, the Pest and
Disgrace of Society.</P>
<P>It will be said, the Hardness of the Landlord
cramps the Industry of the Tenant. But if Rent
be high, and the Landlord rigorous, there is more
need of Industry in the Tenant. It is well known
that in <HI>Holland</HI> Taxes are much higher, and Rent
both of Land and Houses far dearer than in <HI>Ireland.</HI>
But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Indus∣try
of the People, who are rather animated and spur∣red
on to earn a Livelihood by Labour, that is not
to be got without it.</P>
<P>You will say, it is an easy Matter to make a
plausible Discourle on Industry, and its Advantages;
but what can be expected from poor Creatures, who
are destitute of all Conveniencies for exerting their
Industry, who have nothing to improve upon, no∣thing
to begin the World with? I answer, they
have their four Quarters, and five Senses. Is it no∣thing
to possess the bodily Organs found and entire!
That wonderful Machine the Hand, was it formed
to be idle?</P>
<P>Was there but Will to work, there are not want∣ing
in this Island either Opportunities or Encourage∣ments.
Spinning alone might employ all idle
Hands (Children as well as Parents) being soon
learned, easily performed, and never failing of a
Market, requiring neither Wit nor Strength, but
suited to all Ages and Capacities. The Public
provides Utensils, and Persons for teaching the Use
of them; but the Public cannot provide a Heart
and Will to be industrious. These, I will not deny,
may be found in several Persons in some other Parts
of the Kingdom, and where-ever they are found,
the comfortable Effects shew themselves. But
seldom, very seldom are they found in these
<HI>Southern</HI> Peeple, whose Indolence figureth a Lion
<PB N="99" REF="94"/>
in the Way, and is Proof against all Encouarge∣ment.</P>
<P>But you will insist, how can a poor Man, whose
daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent, be
able to provide present Necessaries for his Fa∣mily,
much less to lay up a Store for the future.
It must be owned, a considerable Share of the poor
Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his
Rent. But how are his Wife and Children employ∣ed,
or how doth he employ himself the rest of his
Time? The same Work tires, but different Works
relieve. Where there is a true Spirit of Industry,
there will never be wanting something to do, with∣out
Doors, or within, by Candle-light, if not by
Day-light. <HI>Labor ipse Voluptas,</HI> saith the Poet, and
this is verified in Fact.</P>
<P>In <HI>England,</HI> when the Labour of the Field is over,
it is usual for Men to betake themselves to some
other Labour of a different kind. In the <HI>Northern</HI>
Parts of that industrious Land, the Inhabitants
meet, a jolly Crew, at one another's Houses, where
they merrily and frugally pass the long and dark
Winter Evenings; several Families by the same
Light, and the same Fire, working at their differ∣ent
Manufactures of Wooll, Flax, or Hemp, Com∣pany
mean while mutually cheering and provoking
to labour. In certain other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">e. g. <HI>Newport-Pagnel</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire.</HI></NOTE> Parts you may see,
on a Summer's Evening, the common Labourers
sitting along the Street of a Town or Village,
each at his own Door, with a Cushion before him
making Bone-lace, and earning more in an Even∣ing's
Pastime than an <HI>Irish Family</HI> would in a whole
Day. Those People instead of closing the Day
with a Game on greasy Cards, or lying stretched be∣fore
the Fire, pass their Time much more chear∣fully
<PB N="100" REF="95"/>
in some useful Employment, which Custom
hath rendered light and agreeable.</P>
<P>But admitting, for the various Reasons above
alledged, that it is impossible for our Cottagers to
be rich, yet it is certain they may be clean. Now
bring them to be cleanly, and your Work is half
done. A little Washing, scrubbing, and rubbing,
bestowed on their Persons and Houses, would intro∣duce
a sort of Industry, and Industry in any one
kind is apt to beget it in another.</P>
<P>Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symptom, which
shews itself in our lower <HI>lrish</HI> more, perhaps, than
in any People on this Side <HI>The Cape of Good Hope.</HI>
I will venture to add, that look throughout the
Kingdom, and you shall not find a clean House in∣habited
by clean People, and yet wanting Necessa∣ries;
the same Spirit of Industry that keeps Folk
clean, being sufficient to keep them also in Food
and Raiment.</P>
<P>But alas! our poor <HI>Irish</HI> are wedded to Dirt up∣on
Principle. It is with some them a Maxim, that
the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them
dirty. And I do verily believe, that the Familiari∣ty
with Dirt, contracted and nourished from their
Infancy, is one great Cause of that Sloth which
attends them in every Stage of Life. Were Chil∣dren
but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt, and
obliged to keep themselves clean, they would
have something to do, whereas now they do
nothing.</P>
<P>It is past all doubt, that those who are educated
in a supine Neglect of all Things, either profitable
or decent, must needs contract a Sleepiness and In∣dolence,
which doth necessarily lead to Poverty,
and every other Distress that attends it. <HI>Love not
Sleep,</HI> cries <HI>Solomon, lest thou come to Poverty; open
<PB N="101" REF="96"/>
thine Eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with Bread</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xx. ver. 13.</NOTE>.
It is therefore greatly to be wished, that you would
persuade Parents, to inure their Children betimes to
a Habit of Industry, as the surest Way to shun the
Miseries that must otherwise befal them.</P>
<P>An early Habit, whether of Sloth, or Diligence,
will not fail to shew itself throughout the whole
Course of a Man's Life. <HI>Train up a Child,</HI> saith
the <HI>Wiseman, in the Way he should go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. ch. xxii. ver. 6.</NOTE>. The first Tinc∣ture
often leaves so deep a Stain as no Afterthought
or Endeavour can wash out. Hence Sloth in some
Minds is Proof against all Arguments and Exam∣ples
whatsoever, all Motives of Interest and Duty,
all Impressions even of Cold and Hunger. This
Habit rooted in the Child, grows up and adheres
to the Man, producing a general Listlessness,
and Aversion from Labour. This I take to be our
great Calamity.</P>
<P>For admitting, that some of our Squires and
Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels, and that
their Hardness and Severity is a great Discourage∣ment
to the Tenant, who will naturally prefer Want
and Ease before Want and Toil; it must at the same
time be admitted, that neither is the Landlord, ge∣nerally
speaking, so hard, nor the Climate so severe,
nor the Soil so ungrateful, as not to answer the
Husbandman's Labour, where there is a Spirit of
Industry; the Want of which is the true Cause of
our national Distress. Of this there are many evi∣dent
Proofs.</P>
<P>I have myself known a Man, from the lowest
Condition of Life, without Friends or Education,
not knowing so much as to write or read, bred to
no Trade or Calling, by pure Dint of Day-labour,
<PB N="102" REF="97"/>
Frugality, and Foresight, to have grown wealthy,
even in this Island, and under all the abovementi∣oned
Disadvantages. And what is done by one, is
possible to another.</P>
<P>In <HI>Holland</HI> a Child five Years old is maintained
by its own Labour; In <HI>Ireland</HI> many Children of
twice that Age do nothing but steal, or incumber
the Hearth and Dunghill. This shameful Neglect
of Education shews itself through the whole Course
of their Lives, in a matchless Sloth bred in the ve∣ry
Bone, and not to be accounted for by any out∣ward
Hardship or Discouragement whatever. It is
the native Colour, if we may so speak, and Com∣plexion
of the People. <HI>Dutch, English, French,</HI> or
<HI>Flemish</HI> cannot match them.</P>
<P>Mark an <HI>Irishman</HI> at Work in the Field; if a
Coach, or Horseman go by, he is sure to suspend
his Labour, and stand staring until they are out of
Sight. A Neighbour of mine made it his Remark
in a Journey from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> that all the
Labourers, of whom he enquired the Road, con∣stantly
answered without looking up, or interrupt∣ing
their Work, except one who stood staring and
leaning on his Spade, and him he found to be an
<HI>Irishman.</HI></P>
<P>It is a shameful Thing and peculiar to this Nati∣on,
to see lusty Vagabonds strolling about the Coun∣try,
and begging without any Pretence to beg.
Ask them why they do not labour to earn their own
Livelihood, they will tell you. They want Em∣ployment;
offer to employ them, and they shall re∣fuse
your Offer; or, if you get them to work one
Day, you may be sure not to see them the next. I
have known them tdecline even the lighrest Labour,
that of Hay-making, having at the same time
neither Clothes for their Backs, nor Food for their
Bellies.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="98"/>
A sore Leg is an Estate to such a Fellow, and
this may be easily got and continued with small
Trouble. Such is their Laziness, that rather than
work they will cherish a Distemper. This I know
to be true, having seen more than one Instance,
wherein the second Nature so far prevailed over the
first, that Sloth was preferred to Health. To these
Beggars who make much of their Sores, and pro∣long
their Diseases, you cannot do a more thankless
Office than cure them, except it be to shave their
Beards, which conciliate a sort of Reverence to that
Order of Men.</P>
<P>It is indeed a difficult Task to reclaim such Fel∣lows
from their slothful and brutal Manner of Life,
to which they seem wedded with an Attachment
that no temporal Motives can conquer; nor is there,
humanly speaking, any Hopes they will mend, ex∣cept
their Respect for your Lessons, and Fear of
something beyond the Grave be able to work a
Change in them.</P>
<P>Certainly, if I may advise, you should in Return
for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government,
endeavour to make yourselves useful to the Public;
and this will best be performed by rousing your
poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth. I
shall not now dispute the Truth, or Importance of
other Points, but will venture to say, that you may
still find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an
<HI>honest Industry,</HI> and that this would by no means be
Time thrown away, if promoting your Country's
Interest, and rescuing so many unhappy Wretches
of your Communion from Beggary, or the Gallows,
be thought worth your Pains.</P>
<P>It should seem you cannot in your Sermons do
better than inveigh against Idleness, that extensive
Parent of many Miseries and many Sins; Idleness
the Mother of Hunger and Sister of Theft; <HI>Idle∣ness
<PB N="104" REF="99"/>
which,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Sirach</HI> assures us, <HI>teacheth
many Vices.</HI></P>
<P>The same Doctrine is often preached from the
Gallows. And indeed the Poverty, Nakedness,
and Famine which Idleness entaileth on her Vota∣ries,
do make Men so wretched, that they may
well think it better to die than to live such Lives.
Hence a Courage for all villanous Undertakings,
which bringing Men to a shameful Death, do then
open their Eyes when they are going to be closed
for ever.</P>
<P>If you have any Regard (as it is not to be doubt∣ed)
either for the Souls, or Bodies of your People,
or even for your own Interest and Credit, you can∣not
fail to inveigh against this crying Sin of your
Country. Seeing you are obnoxious to the Laws,
should you not in Prudence try to reconcile your∣selves
to the Favour of the Public; and can you do
this more effectually, than by co-operating with
the public Spirit of the Legislature, and Men in
Power?</P>
<P>Were this but done heartily, would you but <HI>be
instant in Season, and out of Season, reprove, rebuke,
exhort</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</NOTE>, such is the Ascendent you have gained over
the People, that we might soon expect to see the
good Effects thereof. We might hope <HI>that our
Garners would be soon full, affording all manner of
Store, that our Sheep would bring forth thousands,
that our Oxen would be strong to labour, that there
would be no breaking in, nor going out,</HI> (no Robbery,
nor Migration nor Bread) <HI>and that there would be no
Complaining in our Streets.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxliv. ver. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>It stands you upon to act with Vigour in this
Cause, and shake off the Shackles of Sloth from
your Countrymen, the rather, because there be
<PB N="105" REF="100"/>
some who surmise, that yourselves have put them
on. Right, or wrong, Men will be apt to judge
of your Doctrines by their Fruits. It will reflect
small Honour on their Teachers, if instead of Ho∣nesty
and Industry those of your Communion are
peculiarly distinguished by the contrary Qualities,
or if the Nation converted by the great and glori∣ous
<HI>Saint Patrick,</HI> should, above ail other Na∣tions,
be stigmatised and marked out as good for
nothing.</P>
<P>I can never suppose you so much your own Ene∣mies,
as to be Friends to this odious Sloth. But
were this once abolished, and a laudable Industry
introduced in its Stead, it may perhaps be asked,
who are to be Gainers? I answer, <HI>your Reverences</HI>
are like to be great Gainers; for every Peny you
now gain, you will gain a Shilling: you would
gain also in your Credit: and your Lives would be
more comfortable.</P>
<P>You need not be told, how hard it is to take
from Rags and Penury a tolerable Subsistence; or
how offensive to perform the Duties of your Func∣tion,
amidst Stench and Nastiness; or how much
Things would change for the better, in Proportion
to the Industry and Wealth of your Flocks. Duty
as well as Interest calls upon you to clothe the
Naked, and feed the Hungry, by persuading them
to <HI>eat</HI> (in the Apostle's Phrase) <HI>their own Bread,</HI> or,
as the <HI>Psalmist</HI> expresseth it, <HI>the Labour of their
own Hands.</HI> By inspiring your Flocks with a Love
of Industry, you will at once strike at the Root of
many Vices, and dispose them to practise many
Virtues. This therefore is the readiest Way to im∣prove
them.</P>
<P>Consult your Superiors. They shall tell you the
Doctrine here delivered is a sound Catholic Doctrine,
not limited to <HI>Protestants,</HI> but extending to all, and
<PB N="106" REF="101"/>
admitted by all, whether <HI>Protestants</HI> or <HI>Roman Ca∣tholics,
Christians</HI> or <HI>Mahometans, Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles.</HI>
And as it is of the greatest Extent, so it is also of
the highest Importance. <HI>Saint Paul</HI> expresly saith,
<HI>That if any provide not for his own, and especially for
those of his own House, he hath denied the Faith, and
is worse than an Infidel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ch. v. ver. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In vain then do you endeavour to make Men
Orthodox in Points of Faith, if at the same time
in the Eyes of <HI>Christ</HI> and his Apostles, you suffer
them to be worse than Infidels, than those who
have no Faith at all. There is something it seems
worse than even Infidelity; and to incite and sti∣mulate
you to put away that cursed Thing from
among you, is the Design and Aim of this <HI>Address.</HI>
The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch
of the Law of Nature; it was taught by Prophets,
inculcated by Apostles, encouraged and inforced
by Philosophers, Legislators, and all wise States,
in all Ages, and in all Parts of the World. Let
me therefore intreat you to exert yourselves, <HI>To be
Instant in Season, and out of Season, rebuke, reprove,
exhort.</HI> Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion
out of the Way; raise your Voices, omit no
Occasion, public or private, of awakening your
wretched Countrymen from their sweet Dream of
Sloth.</P>
<P>Many suspect your Religion to be the Cause of
that notorious Idleness, which prevails so generally
among the Natives of this Island, as if the <HI>Roman
Catholic</HI> Faith was inconsistent with an honest
Diligence in a Man's Calling. But whoever con∣siders
the great Spirit of Industry that reigns in
<HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and even beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> must
acknowledge this to be a groundless Suspicion. In
<PB N="107" REF="102"/>
<HI>Piedmont</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> in the <HI>Milanese</HI> and the <HI>Ve∣netian
State,</HI> and indeed throughout all <HI>Lombardy,</HI>
how well is the Soil cultivated, and what Manu∣factures
of Silk, Velvet, Paper, and other Com∣modities
flourish? The King of <HI>Sardinia</HI> will suffer
no idle Hands in his Territories, no Beggar to live
by the Sweat of another's Brow; it has even been
made penal at <HI>Turin,</HI> to relieve a strolling Beggar.
To which I might add, that the Person whose Au∣thority
will be of the greatest Weight with you,
even the <HI>Pope</HI> himself, is at this Day endeavouring
to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures
of his Country.</P>
<P>Though I am in no Secret of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI>
yet I will venture to affirm, that neither <HI>Pope,</HI>
nor <HI>Cardinals,</HI> will be pleased to hear, that those of
their Communion are distinguished above all others,
by Sloth, Dirt, and Beggary; or be displeased at
your endeavouring to rescue them from the Reproach
of such an infamous Distinction.</P>
<P>The Case is as clear as the Sun; what we urge
is inforced by every Motive that can work on a
reasonable Mind. The Good of your Country,
your own private Interest, the Duty of your Func∣tion,
the Cries and Distresses of the Poor do with
one Voice call for your Assistance. And if it is
on all hands allowed to be right and just, if agree∣able
both to Reason and Religion, if coincident
with the Views both of your temporal and spiritual
Superiors, it is to be hoped, <HI>this Address</HI> may find a
favourable Reception, and that a Zeal for disputed
Points will not hinder your concurring to propagate
so plain and useful a Doctrine, wherein we are all
agreed.</P>
<P>When a Leak is to be stopped, or a Fire extin∣guished,
do not all Hands co-operate without Dis∣tinction
of Sect or Party? Or if I am fallen into a
<PB N="108" REF="103"/>
Ditch, shall I not suffer a Man to help me out,
until I have first examined his Creed? Or when I
am sick, shall I refuse the Physic, because my Phy∣sician
doth, or doth not believe the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Su∣premacy?</P>
<P><HI>Fas est et ab Hoste doceri.</HI> But in truth, I am no
Enemy to your Persons, whatever I may think of
your Tenets. On the contrary, I am your sincere
Well-wisher. I consider you as my Countrymen,
as Fellow-Subjects, as professing Belief in the same
<HI>Christ.</HI> And I do most sincerely wish, there was
no other Contest between us but <HI>Who shall most com∣pleatly
practise the Precepts of Him by whose Name
we are called, and whose Disciples we all profess to be.</HI></P>

and the true Patriot. All this hath so great an
Effect, upon them, that they have already directed
circular Letters to the Parish Priests of this Dio∣cese,
recommending, in the most earnest Manner,
the Perusal, and zealous Execution of what is con∣tained
in the said Address; and it is hoped, that by
publishing this in your Journal, the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic
Clergy of the other Parts of this Kingdom will be
induced to follow their Example, which must pro∣mote
the laudable Views of that great and good
Man. At the same Time he may be assured, that
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Clergy of this City, have fre∣quently
taken considerable Pains to recommend, to
their respective Flocks, Industry, and a due Ap∣plication
to their different Trades and Callings, as
an indispensible Duty, and the Means of avoiding
the many Vices and bad Consequences which
generally attend criminal Poverty and Want. But
the more effectually to prevent these Evils, and
remove all Excuses for Sloth and Idleness,
they have, several Months ago, pursuant to the Example of
many Bishopricks in <HI>Lombardy, Spain, Naples,</HI> &amp;c.
taken the Steps most proper and expedient, in their
Opinion, to lessen considerably the Number of
Holidays in this Kingdom; and they make no
Doubt but their Expectations will, in a short time,
be fully answered, to the great Advantage of the
Public.</P>

<HEAD>A
LETTER
TO THE
ROMAN CATHOLICS of the
Diocese of Cloyne.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Published in the late Rebellion, A. D. MDCIXLV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Countrymen and Fellow Subjects,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOtwithstanding the Differences of our religi∣ous
Opinions, I should be sorry to be want∣ing
in any Instance of Humanity, or good Neigh∣bourhood
to any of you. For which Reason I find
myself strongly inclined, at this critical Juncture,
to put you in mind, that you have been treat∣ed
with a truly Christian Lenity under the present
Government, that your Persons have been protect∣ed,
and your Properties secured by equal Laws,
and that it would be highly imprudent as well as
ungrateful to forfeit these Advantages, by making
yourselves Tools to the Ambition of foreign Prin∣ces,
who fancy it expedient to raise Disturbances
among us at present, but as soon as their own Ends
are served, will not fail to abandon you, as they
have always done.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="106"/>
Is it not evident that your true Interest consists in
lying still, and waiting the Event, since <HI>Ireland</HI>
must necessarily follow the Fate of <HI>England;</HI> and that
therefore Prudence and Policy prescribe Quiet to
the Roman Catholics of this Kingdom, who, in
case a Change of Hands should not succeed, after
your attempting to bring it about, must then expect
to be on a worse Foot than ever?</P>
<P>But we will suppose it succeeds to your Wish.
What then? Would not this undermine even your
own Interests and Fortune, which are often inter∣woven
with those of your Neighbours? Would
not all those, who have Debts or Money, or other
Effects in the Hands of Protestants, be fellow Suf∣ferers
with them? Would not all those who hold
under the Acts of Settlement, be as liable as Protes∣tants
themselves to be dispossessed by the old Pro∣prietors?
Or, can even those who are stiled Pro∣prietors,
flatter themselves with Hopes of possessing
the Estates which they claim, which, in all likeli∣hood,
would be given to Favourites, (perhaps to
Foreigners) who are near the Person, or who fought
the Battles, of their Master.</P>
<P>Under Protestant Governments, those of your
Communion, have formerly enjoyed a greater Share
of the Lands of this Kingdom, and more ample
Privileges. You bore your Part in the Magistracy
and the Legislature, and could complain of no
Hardships on the Score of your Religion. If these
Advantages have been since impaired or lost, was
it not by the wrong Measures yourselves took to
enlarge them, in several successive Attempts, each
of which left you weaker and in a worse Condi∣tion
than you were before. And this, notwith∣standing
the vaunted Succours of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
whose vain Efforts in Conjunction with yours con∣stantly
recoiled on your own Heads, even when
<PB N="112" REF="107"/>
your Numbers and Circumstances were far more
considerable than they now are.</P>
<P>You all know these Things to be true. I appeal
to your own Breasts. Dear bought Experience
hath taught you, and past Times instruct the pre∣sent.
But perhaps you follow Conscience rather
than Interest. Will any Men amongst you pretend
to plead Conscience against being quiet, or against
paying Allegiance and peaceable Submission to a
Protestant Prince, which the first Christians paid
even to Heathen, and which those of your Com∣munion,
at this Day, pay to Mahometan and to Ido∣latrous
Princes in <HI>Turky</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and which you
yourselves have so often professed to pay to our
present gracious Sovereign? Conscience is quite
out of the Case. And what Man in his Senses
would engage in a dangerous Course, to which nei∣ther
Interest doth invite, nor Conscience oblige
him?</P>
<P>I heartily wish, that this Advice may be as well
taken, as it is meant, and that you may maturely
consider your true Interest, rather than rashly repeat
the same Errors which you have so often repented
of. So recommending you to the merciful Guid∣ance
of Almighty God, I subscribe myself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your real Well-wisher,
GEORGE CLOYNE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<PB N="113" REF="108"/>
<HEAD>MAXIMS
CONCERNING
PATRIOTISM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">First Published, A. D. MDCCL.</HEAD>
<P>1. EVERY Man, by consulting his own Heart,
may easily know whether he is or is not a
Patriot. But it is not so easy for the Bystanders.</P>
<P>2. Being loud and vehement either against a
Court, or for a Court, is no Proof of Patriotism.</P>
<P>3. A Man whose Passion for Money runs high,
bids fair for being no Patriot. And he likewise
whose Appetite is keen for Power.</P>
<P>4. A Native than a Foreigner, a married Man
than a Bachelor, a Believer than an Infidel, have
a better Chance for being Patriots.</P>
<P>5. It is impossible an Epicure should be a Patriot.</P>
<P>6. It is impossible a Man who cheats at Cards,
or cogs the Dice, should be a Patriot.</P>
<P>7. It is impossible a Man who is false to his
Friends and Neighbours should be true to the Public.</P>
<P>8. Every Knave is a thorough Knave. And a
thorough Knave is a Knave throughout.</P>
<P>9. A Man who hath no Sense of God or Con∣science:
would you make such a one Guardian to
your Child? if not, why Guardian to the State?</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="109"/>
10. A Sot, a Beast, benummed and stupified by
Excess, is good for nothing, much less to make a
Patriot of.</P>
<P>11. A Fop or Man of Pleasure makes but a
scurvy Patriot.</P>
<P>12. A sullen, churlish Man, who loves no Body,
will hardly love his Country.</P>
<P>13. The Love of Praise and Esteem may do
something: but to make a true Patriot there must
be an inward Sense of Duty and Conscience.</P>
<P>14. Honesty (like other Things) grows from its
proper Seed, good Principles early laid in the
Mind.</P>
<P>15. To be a real Patriot, a Man must consider
his Countrymen as God's Creatures, and himself as
accountable for his acting towards them.</P>
<P>16. If <HI>pro Aris et Focis</HI> be the Life of Patriotism,
he who hath no Religion or no Home makes a
suspected Patriot.</P>
<P>17. No Man perjures himself for the sake of
Conscience.</P>
<P>18. There is an easy Way of reconciling Male-contents.—<HI>Sunt
verba &amp; voces quibus hunc lenire
dolorem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>19. A good Groom will rather stroke than strike.</P>
<P>20. He who saith there is no such Thing as
an honest Man, you may be sure is himself a
Knave.</P>
<P>21. I have no Opinion of your bumper Patriots.
Some eat, some drink, some quarrel for their
Country. MODERN PATRIOTISM!</P>
<P>22. <HI>Ibycus</HI> is a carking, griping, close-fisted Fellow.
It is odds that <HI>Ibycus</HI> is not a Patriot.</P>
<P>23. We are not to think every clamorous Ha∣ranguer,
or every splenetic Repiner against a Court,
is therefore a Patriot.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="110"/>
24. A Patriot is one who heartily wisheth the
public Prosperity, and doth not only wish, but also
study and endeavour to promote it.</P>
<P>25. Gamesters, Fops, Rakes, Bullies, Stock-jobbers:
alas! what Patriots?</P>
<P>26. Some Writers have thought it impossible
that Men should be brought to laugh at public
Spirit. Yet this hath been done in the present
Age.</P>
<P>27. The Patriot aims at his private Good in
the Public. The Knave makes the Public subser∣vient
to his private Interest. The former considers
himself as Part of a Whole, the latter considers
himself as the Whole.</P>
<P>28. There is and ever will be a natural Strife be∣tween
Court and Country. The one will get as
much, and the other give as little as it can. How
must the Patriot behave himself?</P>
<P>29. He gives the necessary. If he gives more,
it is with a View of gaining more to his Country.</P>
<P>30. A Patriot will never barter the public Money
for his private Gain.</P>
<P>31. Moral Evil is never to be committed, phy∣sical
Evil may be incurred, either to avoid a greater
Evil, or to procure a good.</P>
<P>32. Where the Heart is right, there is true Pa∣triotism.</P>
<P>33. In your Man of Business, it is easier to meet
with a good Head than a good Heart.</P>
<P>34. A Patriot will admit there may be honest
Men, and that honest Men may differ.</P>
<P>35. He that always blames or always praises is
no Patriot.</P>
<P>36. Were all sweet and sneaking Courtiers, or
were all four Malecontents; in either Case the
Public would thrive but ill.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="111"/>
37. A Patriot would hardly wish there was no
Contrast in the State.</P>
<P>38. Ferments of the worst Kind succeed to per∣fect
Inaction.</P>
<P>39. A Man rages, rails and raves; I suspect his
Patriotism.</P>
<P>40. The fawning Courtier and the surly 'Squire
often mean the same Thing, each his own Interest.</P>
<P>41. A Patriot will esteem no Man for being of
his Party.</P>
<P>42. The factious Man is apt to mistake himself
for a Patriot.</P>

<P>THE
QUERIST. CONTAINING
Several <HI>QUERIES,</HI>

CONSIDERATION
OF THE

<Q>I the Lord have brought down the high Tree, have

and have made the dry Tree to flourish.</Q>

<HEAD>Advertisement by the AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE QUERIST was first printed in the
Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and
Thirty-five; since which Time, the Face of Things
is somewhat changed. In this Edition, some Al∣terations
have been made. The three Parts are
published in one; some Few Queries are added, and
many omitted, particularly, of those relating to the
Sketch or Plan of a national Bank; which it may
be time enough to take again in hand, when the
Public shall seem disposed to make use of such an
Expedient. I had determined with myself never to
prefix my Name to the Querist, but in the last
Edition was over-ruled by a Friend, who was re∣markable
for pursuing the publics Interest with as
much Diligence, as others do their own. I appre∣hend
the same Censure on this, that I incurred upon
another Occasion, for meddling out of my pro∣fession.
Though to feed the Hungry and clothe
the Naked, by promoting an honest Industry, will,
perhaps, be deemed no improper Employment for
a Clergyman, who still thinks himself a Member
of the Commonwealth. As the Sum of human
Happiness is supposed to consist in the Goods of
Mind, Body and Fortune, I would fain make my
Studies of some Use to Mankind, with regard to
each of these three Particulars, and hope it will not
be thought faulty or indecent in any Man, of what
Profession soever, to offer his Mite towards, im∣proving
the Manners, Health and Prosperity of his
Fellow-creatures.</P>

<HEAD>THE
QUERIST.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> 1. WHETHER there ever was, is, or
will be, an industrious Nation poor,
or an idle rich?</P>
<P>2. Whether a People can be called poor, where
the common Sort are well fed, clothed and lodged?</P>
<P>3. Whether the Drift and Aim of every wise
State should not be, to encourage Industry in its
Members? And, whether those, who employ neither
Heads nor Hands for the common Benefit, deserve
not to be expelled like Drones out of a well go∣verned
State?</P>
<P>4. Whether the four Elements, and Man's Labour
therein, be not the true Source of Wealth?</P>
<P>5. Whether Money be not only so far useful, as
it stirreth up Industry, enabling Men mutually to
participate the Fruits of each others Labour?</P>
<P>6. Whether any other Means, equally conducing
to excite and circulate the Industry of Mankind,
may not be as useful as Money?</P>
<P>7. Whether the real End and Aim of Men be
not Power? And whether he who could have every
Thing else at his Wish or Will, would value
Money?</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="115"/>
8. Whether the public Aim in every well go∣verned
State be not, that each Member, according
to his just Pretensions and Industry, should have
Power?</P>
<P>9. Whether Power be not referred to Action; and
whether Action doth not follow Appetite or Will?</P>
<P>10. Whether Fashion doth not create Appetites;
and whether the prevailing Will of a Nation is not
the Fashion?</P>
<P>11. Whether the Current of Industry and Com∣merce
be not determined by this prevailing Will?</P>
<P>12. Whether it be not owing to Custom, that
the Fashions are agreeable?</P>
<P>13. Whether it may not concern the Wisdom
of the Legislature to interpose in the making of
Fashions; and not leave an Affair of so great In∣fluence,
to the Management of Women and Fops,
Taylors and Vintners?</P>
<P>14. Whether reasonable Fashions are a greater
Restraint on Freedom than those which are un∣reasonable?</P>
<P>15. Whether a general good Taste in a People
would not greatly conduce to their thriving? And
whether an uneducated Gentry be not the greatest
of national Evils?</P>
<P>16. Whether Customs and Fashions do not sup∣ply
the Place of Reason, in the Vulgar of all Ranks?
Whether, therefore, it doth not very much import
that they should be wisely framed?</P>
<P>17. Whether the imitating those Neighbours in
our Fashions, to whom we bear no Likeness in our
Circumstances, be not one Cause of Distress to this
Nation?</P>
<P>18. Whether frugal Fashions in the upper Rank,
and comfortable Living in the lower, be not the
Means to multiply Inhabitants?</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="116"/>
19. Whether the Bulk of our <HI>Irish</HI> Natives are
not kept from thriving, by that Cynical Content in
Dirt and Beggary, which they possess to a Degree
beyond any other People in Christendom?</P>
<P>20. Whether the creating of Wants be not the
likeliest Way to produce Industry in a People?
And whether, if our Peasants were accustomed to
eat Beef and wear Shoes, they would not be more
industrious?</P>
<P>21. Whether other Things being given, as Cli∣mate,
Soil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Wealth be not proportioned
to the Industry, and this to the Circulation of Credit,
be the Credit circulated or transferred by what
Marks or Tokens soever?</P>
<P>22. Whether, therefore, less Money, swiftly cir∣culating,
be not, in effect, equivalent to more
Money slowly circulating? Or, whether, if the
Circulation be reciprocally as the Quantity of Coin,
the Nation can be a Loser?</P>
<P>23. Whether Money is to be considered as hav∣ing
an intrinsic Value, or as being a Commodity,
a Standard, a Measure, or a Pledge, as is variously
suggested by Writers? And whether the true Idea
of Money, as such, be not altogether that of a
Ticket or Counter?</P>
<P>24. Whether the Value or Price of Things, be
not a compounded Proportion, directly as the De∣mand,
and reciprocally as the Plenty?</P>
<P>25. Whether the Terms Crown, Livre, Pound
Sterling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not to be considered as Exponents
or Denominations of such Proportion? And whether
Gold, Silver and Paper, are not Tickets or Coun∣ters
for Reckoning, Recording, and Transferring
thereof?</P>
<P>26. Whether the Denominations being retained,
although the Bullion were gone, Things might not
nevertheless be rated, bought and sold, Industry
<PB N="122" REF="117"/>
promoted, and a Circulation of Commerce main∣tained?</P>
<P>27. Whether an equal raising of all Sorts of
Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin, can have any
Effect in bringing Money into the Kingdom? And
whether altering the Proportions between the se∣veral
Sorts, can have any other Effect, but multiply∣ing
one Kind and lessening another, without any
Increase of the Sum total?</P>
<P>28. Whether arbitrary changing the Denomi∣nation
of Coin, be not a public Cheat?</P>
<P>29. What makes a wealthy People? Whether
Mines of Gold and Silver are capable of doing this?
And whether the Negroes amidst the Gold Sands of
<HI>Afric,</HI> are not poor and destitute?</P>
<P>30. Whether there be any Virtue in Gold or
Silver, other than as they set People at Work, or
create Industry?</P>
<P>31. Whether it be not the Opinion or Will of
the People, exciting them to Industry, that truly
enricheth a Nation? And whether this doth not
principally depend on the Means for counting, trans∣ferring,
and preserving Power, that is, Property of
all Kinds?</P>
<P>32. Whether if there was no Silver or Gold in
the Kingdom, our Trade might not nevertheless
supply Bills of Exchange, sufficient to answer the
Demands of Absentees in <HI>England.</HI> or elsewhere?</P>
<P>33. Whether current Bank-Notes may not be
deemed Money? And whether they are not actually
the greater Part of the Money of this Kingdom?</P>
<P>34. Provided the Wheels move, whether it is
not the same Thing, as to the Effect of the Ma∣chine,
be this done by the Force of Wind, or Water, or
Animals?</P>
<P>35. Whether Power to command the Industry
of others be not real Wealth? And whether Money
<PB N="123" REF="118"/>
be not in truth, Tickets or Tokens for convey∣ing
and recording such Power, and whether it be
of great Consequence what Materials the Tickets
are made of?</P>
<P>36. Whether Trade, either foreign or domestic,
be in truth any more than this Commerce of In∣dustry?</P>
<P>37. Whether to promote, transfer, and secure
this Commerce, and this Property in human Labour,
or, in other words, this Power, be not the sole
Means of enriching a People, and how far this may
be done independently of Gold and Silver?</P>
<P>38. Whether it were not wrong to suppose Land
itself to be Wealth? And whether the Industry of
the People is not first to be considered, as that
which constitutes Wealth, which makes even Land
and Silver to be Wealth, neither of which would
have any Value, but as Means and Motives to In∣dustry?</P>
<P>39. Whether in the Wastes of <HI>America,</HI> a Man
might not possess twenty Miles square of Land, and
yet want his Dinner, or a Coat to his Back?</P>
<P>40. Whether a fertile Land, and the Industry
of its Inhabitants, would not prove inexhaustible
Funds of real Wealth, be the Counters for convey∣ing
and recording thereof what you will, Paper,
Gold, or Silver?</P>
<P>41. Whether a single Hint be sufficient to over∣come
a Prejudice? And whether even obvious
Truths will not sometimes bear repeating?</P>
<P>42. Whether if human Labour be the true
Source of Wealth, it doth not follow that Idleness
should of all Things be discouraged in a wise State?</P>
<P>43. Whether even Gold, or Silver, if they should
lessen the Industry of its Inhabitants, would not be
ruinous to a Country? And whether <HI>Spain</HI> be not
an Instance of this?</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="119"/>
44. Whether the Opinion of Men, and their
Industry consequent thereupon, be not the true
Wealth of <HI>Holland,</HI> and not the Silver supposed to
be deposited in the Bank at <HI>Amsterdam?</HI></P>
<P>45. Whether there is in truth any such Treasure
lying dead? And whether it be of great Conse∣quence
to the Public, that it should be real, rather
than notional?</P>
<P>46. Whether in order to understand the true
Nature of Wealth and Commerce, it would not
be right to consider a Ship's Crew cast upon a de∣sert
Island, and by degrees forming themselves to
Business and civil Life, while Industry begot Credit,
and Credit moved to Industry?</P>
<P>47. Whether such Men would not all set them∣selves
to Work? Whether they would not subsist
by the mutual Participation of each other's Industry?
Whether when one Man had in his Way procured
more than he could consume, he would not ex∣change
his Superfluities to supply his Wants?
Whether this must not produce Credit? Whether
to facilitate these Conveyances, to record and cir∣culate
this Credit, they would not soon agree on
certain Tallies, Tokens, Tickets, or Counters?</P>
<P>48. Whether Reflexion in the better Sort might
not soon remedy our Evils? And whether our real
Defect be not in a wrong Way of Thinking?</P>
<P>49. Whether it would not be an unhappy Turn
in our Gentlemen, if they should take more Thought
to create an Interest to themselves in this or that
County, or Borough, than to promote the real In∣terest
of their Country?</P>
<P>50. Whether if a Man builds a House he doth
not in the first Place provide a Plan which governs
his Work? And shall the Public act without an
End, a View, a Plan?</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="120"/>
51. Whether by how much the less particular
Folk think for themselves, the Public be not so
much the more obliged to think for them?</P>
<P>52. Whether small Gains be not the Way to
great Profit? And if our Tradesmen are Beggars,
whether they may not thank themselves for it?</P>
<P>53. Whether some Way might not be found for
making Criminals useful in public Works, instead
of sending them either to <HI>America,</HI> or to the other
World?</P>
<P>54. Whether we may not, as well as other Na∣tions,
contrive Employment for them? And
whether Servitude, Chains, and hard Labour, for a
Term of Years, would not be a more discouraging,
as well as a more adequate Punishment for Felons,
than even Death itself?</P>
<P>55. Whether there are not such Things in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
as bettering Houses, for bringing young Gen∣tlemen
to Order? And whether such an Institution
would be useless among us?</P>
<P>56. Whether it be true, that the Poor in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
have no Resource but their own Labour, and
yet there are no Beggars in their Streets?</P>
<P>57. Whether he whose Luxury consumeth foreign
Products, and whose Industry produceth nothing
domestic to exchange for them, is not so far forth
injurious to his Country?</P>
<P>58. Whether Necessity is not to be hearkened
to before Convenience, and Convenience before
Luxury?</P>
<P>59. Whether to provide plentifully for the Poor,
be not feeding the Root, the Substance whereof will
shoot upwards into the Branches, and cause the Top
to flourish?</P>
<P>60. Whether there be any Instance of a State
wherein the People, living neatly and plentifully,
did not aspire to Wealth?</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="121"/>
61. Whether Nastiness and Beggary do not, on
the contrary, extinguish all such Ambition, making
Men listless, hopeless, and slothful?</P>
<P>62. Whether a Country inhabited by People
well fed, clothed and lodged, would not become
every Day more populous? And whether a nume∣rous
Stock of People in such Circumstances would
not constitute a flourishing Nation; and how far the
Product of our own Country may suffice for the
compassing of this End?</P>
<P>63. Whether a People, who had provided them∣selves
with the Necessaries of Life in good Plenty,
would not soon extend their Industry to new Arts
and new Branches of Commerce?</P>
<P>64. Whether those same Manufactures which
<HI>England</HI> imports from other Countries, may not be
admitted from <HI>Ireland?</HI> And, if so, whether Lace,
Carpets and Tapestry, three considerable Articles,
of <HI>English</HI> Importation, might not find Encourage∣ment
in <HI>Ireland?</HI> And whether an Academy for
Design might not greatly conduce to the perfect∣ing
those Manufactures among us?</P>
<P>65. Whether <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> could have
drawn so much Money from <HI>England,</HI> for figured
Silks, Lice, and Tapestry, if they had not had
Academies for Designing?</P>
<P>66. Whether when a Room was once prepared,
and Models in Plaister of <HI>Paris,</HI> the Annual Expence
of such an Academy need stand the Public in above
two hundred Pounds a Year?</P>
<P>67. Whether our Linen-Manufacture would not
find the Benefit of this Institution? and whether
there be any Thing that makes us fall short of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> in Damasks, Diapers, and printed Linen
but our Ignorance in Design?</P>
<P>68. Whether those, who may slight this Affair
as notional, have sufficiently considered the exten∣sive
<PB N="127" REF="122"/>
Use of the Art of Design, and its Influence in
most Trades and Manufactures, wherein the Forms
of Things are often more regarded than the Ma∣terials<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the first Publication of this Query, the Art of De∣sign seems to be more considered and countenanced among us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>69. Whether there be any Art sooner learned
than that of making Carpets? And whether our
Women, with little Time and Pains, may not
make more beautiful Carpets than those imported
from <HI>Turkey?</HI> And whether this Branch of the
Woollen-Manufacture be not open to us?</P>
<P>70. Whether human Industry can produce, from
such cheap Materials, a Manufacture of so great
Value, by any other Art, as by those of Sculpture
and Painting?</P>
<P>71. Whether Pictures and Statues are not in Fact
so much Treasure? And whether <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI>
would not be poor Towns without them?</P>
<P>72. Whether they do not bring ready Money,
as well as Jewels? Whether in <HI>Italy</HI> Debts are not
paid, and Children portioned with them, as with
Gold and Silver?</P>
<P>73. Whether it would not be more prudent, to
strike out, and exert ourselves in permitted Branches
of Trade, than to fold our Hands and repine, that
we are not allowed the Woollen?</P>
<P>74. Whether it be true, that two Millions are
yearly expended by <HI>England</HI> by foreign Lace and
Linen?</P>
<P>75. Whether immense Sums are not drawn yearly
into the <HI>Northern</HI> Countries, for supplying the
<HI>British</HI> Navy with Hempen Manufactures?</P>
<P>76. Whether there be any Thing more profitable
than Hemp? And whether there should not be great
Praemiums for encouraging our Hempen Trade?
<PB N="128" REF="123"/>

not reap the Benefit of such public Banks, as well
as other Countries?</P>
<P>223. Whether a Bank of national Credit, sup∣ported
by public Funds and secured by Parliament,
be a Chimera or impossible Thing? and if not,
what would follow from the Supposal of such a
Bank?</P>
<P>224. Whether the Currency of a Credit so well
secured would not be of great Advantage to our
Trade and Manufactures?</P>
<P>225. Whether the Notes of such public Bank
would not have a more general Circulation than
those of private Banks, as being less subject to
Frauds and Hazards?</P>
<P>226. Whether it be not agreed that Paper hath
in many Respects, the Advantage above Coin, as
being of more Dispatch in Payments, more easily
transferred, preserved and recovered when lost?</P>
<P>227. Whether, besides these Advantages, there
be not an evident Necessity for circulating Credit
by Paper, from the Defect of Coin in this King∣dom?</P>
<P>228. Whether it be rightly remarked by some,
that, as Banking brings no Treasure into the King∣dom
like Trade, private Wealth must sink as the
Bank riseth? And whether whatever causeth In∣dustry
to flourish and circulate, may not be said to
increase our Treasure?</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="139"/>
229 Whether the ruinous Effects of <HI>Mississippi,
South-Sea,</HI> and such Schemes, were not owing to
an abuse of Paper-Money or Credit, in making it
a Means for Idleness and Gaming, instead of a Mo∣tive
and Help to Industry?</P>
<P>230. Whether the Rise of the Bank of <HI>Amster∣dam</HI>
was not purely casual, for the Security and Dis∣patch
of Payments? And whether the good Effects
thereof, in supplying the Place of Coin, and pro∣moting
a ready Circulation of Industry and Com∣merce,
may not be a Lesson to us, to do that by
Design, which others fell upon by Chance?</P>
<P>231. Whether plenty of small Cash be not ab∣solutely
necessary for keeping up a Circulation
among the People; that is, whether Copper be not
more necessary than Gold?</P>
<P>232. Whether that, which increaseth the Stock
of a Nation, be not a Means of increasing its
Trade? And whether that, which increaseth the
current Credit of a Nation, may not be said to in∣crease
its Stock?</P>
<P>233. Whether the Credit of the public Funds
be not a Mine of Gold to <HI>England?</HI> And whether
any Step that should lessen this Credit ought not to
be dreaded?</P>
<P>234. Whether such Credit be not the principal
Advantage that <HI>England</HI> hath over <HI>France?</HI> I may
add, over every other Country in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>235. Whether by this the Public is not become
possessed of the Wealth of Foreigners as well as
Natives? And whether <HI>England</HI> be not in some sort
the Treasury of <HI>Christendom?</HI></P>
<P>236. Whether as our current domestic Credit
grew, Industry would not grow likewise? and if
Industry, our Manufactures; and if these, our fo∣reign
Credit?</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="140"/>
237. Whether foreign Demands may not be an∣swered
by our Exports without drawing Cash out of
the Kingdom?</P>
<P>238. Whether as Industry increased, our Manu∣factures
would not flourish? and as these flourished,
whether better Returns would not be made from
Estates to their Landlords, both within and with∣out
the Kingdom?</P>
<P>239. Whether the sure Way to supply People
with Tools and Materials, and to set them at Work,
be not a free Circulation of Money, whether Silver
of Paper?</P>
<P>240. Whether in <HI>New England,</HI> all Trade and
Business is not as much at a Stand, upon a Scarcity
of Paper-Money, as with us from the Want of
Specie?</P>
<P>241. Whether it be certain, that the Quantity
of Silver in the Bank of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> be greater now
than at first? but whether it be not certain that
there is a greater Circulation of Industry and Ex∣tent
of Trade, more People, Ships, Houses and
Commodities of all Sorts, more Power by Sea and
Land?</P>
<P>242. Whether Money, lying dead in the Bank
of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> would not be as useless as in the
Mine?</P>
<P>243. Whether our visible Security in Land could
be doubted? And whether there be any Thing like
this in the Bank of <HI>Amsterdam?</HI></P>
<P>244. Whether it be just to apprehend Danger
from trusting a national Bank with Power to extend
its Credit, to circulate Notes which it shall be Felo∣ny
to counterfeit, to receive Goods on Loans, to
purchase Lands, to sell also or alienate them, and
to deal in Bills of Exchange; when these Powers
are no other than have been trusted for many Years
<PB N="146" REF="141"/>
with the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> although in Truth but
a private Bank?</P>
<P>245. Whether the Objection from Monopolies
and an Over-Growth of Power, which are made
against private Banks, can possibly hold against a
national one?</P>
<P>246. Whether the evil Effects, which of late
Years have attended Paper-Money and Credit in
<HI>Europe,</HI> did not spring from Subscriptions, Shares,
Dividends and Stock-Jobbing?</P>
<P>247. Whether the great Evils attending Paper-Money
in the <HI>British</HI> Plantations of <HI>America</HI> have
not sprung from the over-rating their Lands, and
issuing Paper without Discretion, and from the
Legislators breaking their own Rules in Favour of
themselves, thus sacrificing the Public to their pri∣vate
Benefit? And whether a little Sense and Ho∣nesty
might not easily prevent all such Inconveni∣encies?</P>
<P>248. Whether the Subject of Free-thinking in
Religion be not exhausted? And whether it be not
high Time for our Free-Thinkers to turn their
Thoughts to the Improvement of their Country?</P>
<P>249. Whether it must not be ruinous for a Na∣tion
to sit down to game, be it with Silver or
with Paper?</P>
<P>250. Whether, therefore, the circulating Paper,
in the late ruinous Schemes of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI>
was the true Evil, and not rather the circulating
thereof without Industry? And whether the Bank
of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where Industry had been for so ma∣ny
Years subsisted and circulated by Transfers on
Paper, doth not clearly decide this Point?</P>
<P>251. Whether there are not to be seen in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>
fair Towns, wherein the People are well lodg∣ed,
fed and clothed, without a Beggar in their
<PB N="147" REF="142"/>
Streets, although there be not one Grain of Gold
or Silver current among them?</P>
<P>252. Whether these People do not exercise all
Arts and Trades, build Ships and navigate them to
all Parts of the World, purchase Lands, till and
reap the Fruits of them, buy and sell, educate and
provide for their Children? Whether they do not
even indulge themselves in foreign Vanities?</P>
<P>253. Whether, whatever Inconveniencies those
People may have incurred, from not observing
either Rules or Bounds in their Paper-Money, yet
it be not certain that they are in a more flourishing
Condition, have larger and better built Towns,
more Plenty, more Industry, more Arts and Civi∣lity,
and a more extensive Commerce, than when
they had Gold and Silver current among them?</P>
<P>254. Whether a View of the ruinous Effects of
absurd Schemes and Credit mismanaged, so as to
produce Gaming and Madness instead of Industry,
can be any just Objection against a national Bank
calculated purely to promote Industry?</P>
<P>255. Whether a Scheme for the Welfare of this
Nation should not take in the whole Inhabitants?
And whether it be not a vain Attempt, to project
the flourishing of our Protestant Gentry, exclusive
of the Bulk of the Natives?</P>
<P>256. Whether an Oath, testifying Allegiance to
the King and disclaiming the Pope's Authority in
Temporals, may not be justly required of the Ro∣man-Catholics?
And whether, in common Pru∣dence
or Policy, any Priest should be tolerated who
refuseth to take it?</P>
<P>257. Whether there is any such Thing as a Bo∣dy
of Inhabitants, in any Roman-Catholic Coun∣try
under the Sun, that profess an absolute Submis∣sion
to the Pope's Orders in Matters of an indif∣ferent
<PB N="148" REF="143"/>
Nature, or that in such Points do not think it
their Duty, to obey the civil Government?</P>
<P>258. Whether since the Peace of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Mass
was not celebrated, and the Sacraments administred
in divers Dioceses of <HI>Sicily,</HI> notwithstanding the
<HI>Pope</HI>'s Interdict?</P>
<P>259. Whether a Sum, which would go but a
little Way towards erecting Hospitals for maintain∣ing
and educating the Children of the native <HI>Irish,</HI>
might not go far in binding them out Apprentices
to Protestant Masters, for Husbandry, useful Trades,
and the Service of Families?</P>
<P>260. Whether there be any Instance, of a Peo∣ple's
being converted in a Christian Sense other∣wise
than by preaching to them and instructing
them in their own Language?</P>
<P>261. Whether Catechists in the <HI>Irish</HI> Tongue
may not easily be procured and subsisted? And
whether this would not be the most practicable
Means for converting the Natives?</P>
<P>262. Whether it be not of great Advantage to
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that she hath Clergy suited to
all Ranks of Men, in gradual Subordination from
Cardinals down to Mendicants?</P>
<P>263. Whether her numerous poor Clergy are not
very useful in Missions, and of much Influence with
the People?</P>
<P>264. Whether in Defect of able Missionaries,
Persons conversant in low Life, and speaking the
<HI>Irish</HI> Tongue, if well instructed in the first Princi∣ples
of Religion and in the popish Controversy,
though for the rest on a Level with the Parish
Clerks, or the School-masters of Charity-Schools,
may not be fit to mix with and bring over our poor
illiterate Natives to the established Church? Whe∣ther
it is not to be wished that some Parts of our
<PB N="149" REF="144"/>
Liturgy and Homilies were publicly read in the
<HI>Irish</HI> Language? And whether, in these Views, it
may not be right to breed up some of the better
Sort of Children in the Charity-Schools and qualify
them for Missionaries, Catechists and Readers?</P>
<P>265. Whether a 'Squire possessed of Land to
the Value of a thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> or a
Merchant worth twenty thousand Pounds in Cash
would have most Power to do good or evil upon
any Emergency? And whether the suffering Roman
Catholics to purchase forfeited Lands, would not
be good Policy as tending to unite their Interest
with that of the Government?</P>
<P>266. Whether the Sea-ports of <HI>Galway, Limerick, Cork,</HI>
and <HI>Waterford,</HI> are not to be looked on as
Keys of this Kingdom? And whether the Mer∣chants
are not possessed of these Keys; and who are
the most numerous Merchants in those Cities?</P>
<P>267. Whether a Merchant cannot more speedily
raise a Sum, more easily conceal or transfer his
Effects, and engage in any desperate Design with
more safety than a landed Man, whose Estate is a
Pledge for his Behaviour?</P>
<P>268. Whether a wealthy Merchant bears not
great Sway among the Populace of a trading City?
And whether Power be not ultimately lodged
in the People?</P>
<P>269. Whether, as others have supposed an <HI>At∣lantis,</HI>
or <HI>Eutopia,</HI> we also may not suppose an <HI>Hy∣perborean</HI>
Island inhabited by reasonable Creatures?</P>

<P>271. Whether there be any Country in Chris∣tendom
more capable of Improvement than <HI>Ireland?</HI></P>
<P>272. Whether we are not as far before other

Misery?</P>
<P>274. Whether my Countrymen are not readier
at finding Excuses than Remedies?</P>
<P>275. Whether the Wealth and Prosperity of our

Fortunes without being the better for it?</P>
<P>288. Whether the same Evils would be appre∣hended
from Paper-Money under an honest and

<P>289. Whether, therefore, a national Bank would
not be more beneficial than even a Mine of Gold?</P>
<P>290. Whether without private Banks what little
Business and Industry there is would not stagnate?
But whether it be not a mighty Privilege for a pri∣vate
Person, to be able to create an hundred Pounds

<P>291. Whether the wise State of <HI>Venice</HI> was not
the first that conceived the Advantage of a national

Goods in gross and Letters of Exchange, must not
be made by Transfers in the Bank Books, provided
the Sum exceed three hundred Florins?</P>
<P>295. Whether it be not owing to this Bank,
that the City of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> without the least Con∣fusion,
Hazard or Trouble, maintains and every
Day promotes so general and quick a Circulation of
Industry?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="147"/>
296. Whether it be not the greatest Help and
Spur to Commerce, that Property can be so readily
conveyed and so well secured by a <HI>Compte en Banc,</HI>
that is, by only writing one Man's Name for ano∣ther's
in the Bank-Book?</P>
<P>297. Whether at the beginning of the last Cen∣tury,
those who had lent Money to the Public dur∣ing
the War with <HI>Spain,</HI> were not satisfied by the
sole Expedient of placing their Names in a <HI>Compte
en Banc,</HI> with Liberty to transfer their Claims?</P>
<P>298. Whether the Example of those easy Trans∣fers
in the <HI>Compte en Banc,</HI> thus casually erected,
did not tempt other Men to become Creditors to
the Public, in order to profit by the same secure
and expeditious Method of keeping and transferring
their Wealth?</P>

proved better than a Mine of Gold to <HI>Amsterdam?</HI></P>

such extraordinary Growth?</P>
<P>302. Whether the Success of those public Banks,

<P>445. Whether in the rude Original of Society,
the first Step was not the exchanging of Commo∣dities,
the next a substituting of Metals by Weight

<P>447. Whether there can be a worse Sign than
that People should quit their Country for a Live∣lihood?
Though Men often leave their Country

bad, and sheweth some peculiar Misma∣nagement?</P>

artificial Helps are not most wanted, in a Land

all Ranks imagine?</P>
<P>450. Whether it be not evident that we may
maintain a much greater inward and outward Com∣merce,

<P>465. Whether, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> it be not true
that the Prices of Things increase, as the Quantity

such Necessaries as other Countries cannot well be

every State, that its Money should rather circulate
than stagnate?</P>

its ready passing from hand to hand, to answer com∣mon

not often at a Stand and often hindred, even though
the Seller hath his Commodities at hand, and the

by a Shilling that circulates, than a Pound that lies
dead?</P>
<P>478. Whether Six-pence twice paid, be not as
good as a Shilling once paid?</P>
<P>479. Whether the same Shilling circulating in
a Village may not supply one Man with Bread,
another with Stockings, a third with a Knife, a fourth
with Paper, a fifth with Nails, and so answer
many Wants which must otherwise have remained
unsatisfied?</P>
<P>480. Whether facilitating and quickening the
Circulation of Power to supply Wants, be not

promoting of Wealth and Industry among the lower
People? And whether upon this the Wealth of

it be not vain to hope for thriving Ma∣nufacturers

that <HI>England</HI> may hereaster prohibit, limit, or dis∣courage

merely by making Pins?</P>

idle Fingers among the Wives and Daughters of
our Peasants?</P>

from Saffron, dying Drugs and the like Products,
which may do with us as well as with them?</P>
<P>510. Whether we may not have Materials of
our own Growth to supply all Manufactures, as well
as <HI>France,</HI> except Silk, and whether the Bulk of
what Silk, even France manufactures, be not im∣ported?</P>
<P>511. Whether it be possible for this Country to
grow rich, so long as what is made by domestic
Industry is spent in foreign Luxury?</P>
<P>512. Whether our natural <HI>Irish</HI> are not partly
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and partly <HI>Tartars?</HI> and whether they
do not bear Signatures of their Descent from both
these Nations, which is also confirmed by all their
Histories?</P>
<P>513. Whether the <HI>Tartar</HI> Progeny is not nume∣rous
in this Land? And whether there is an idler
Occupation under the Sun than to attend Flocks
and Herds of Cattle?</P>
<P>514. Whether the Wisdom of the State should
not wrestle with this hereditary Disposition of our
<HI>Tartars,</HI> and with a high hand introduce Agri∣culture?</P>
<P>515. Whether once upon a Time <HI>France</HI> did not,
by her Linen alone, draw yearly from <HI>Spain</HI> about
eight Millions of Livres?</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="171"/>
516. Whether the <HI>French</HI> have not suffered in
their Linen-Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> by not making their
Cloth of due Breadth? and whether any other Peo∣ple
have suffered, and are still likely to suffer through
the same Prevarication?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Things, we hear, are in a Way of being mended with us in this Respect.</NOTE></P>
<P>517. Whether the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not rich and
lazy, and whether they have not a particular Incli∣nation
and Favour for the Inhabitants of this Island?
But whether a punctual People do not love punctual
Dealers?</P>
<P>518. Whether about fourteen Years ago we
had not come into a considerable Share of the
Linen-Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> and what put a Stop to
this?</P>
<P>519. Whether if the Linen-Manufacture were
carried on in the other Provinces, as well as in the
<HI>North,</HI> the Merchants of <HI>Cork, Limerick</HI> and <HI>Galway</HI>
would not soon find the Way to <HI>Spain?</HI></P>
<P>520. Whether the Woollen-Manufacture of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
is not divided into several Parts or Branches,
appropriated to particular Places, where they are
only, or principally manufactured; fine Cloths in
<HI>Somersetshire,</HI> coarse in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> long Ells at <HI>Exeter,</HI>
Saies at <HI>Sudbury,</HI> Crapes at <HI>Norwich,</HI> Linseys at <HI>Ken∣dal,</HI>
Blankets at <HI>Whitney,</HI> and so forth?</P>
<P>521. Whether the united Skill, Industry and
Emulation of many together on the same Work,
be not the Way to advance it? And whether it had
been otherwise possible for <HI>England,</HI>
to have carried on her Woollen-Manufacture to so great Per∣fection?</P>
<P>522. Whether it would not on many Accounts
be right, if we observed the same Course with re∣spect
to our Linen-Manufacture; and that Diapers
<PB N="177" REF="172"/>
were made in one Town or District, Damasks in
another, Sheeting in a third, fine wearing Linen in
a fourth, coarse in a fifth, in another Cambricks, in
another Thread and Stockings, in others stamped
Linen, or striped Linen, or Tickings, or dyed
Linen, of which last Kinds, there is so great a
Consumption among the Sea-faring Men of all

are in Request among different People?</P>
<P>524. Whether we do not yearly consume of
<HI>French</HI> Wines about a thousand Tuns more than
either <HI>Sweden</HI> or <HI>Denmark,</HI> and yet, whether those
Nations pay ready Money as we do?</P>
<P>525. Whether it be not a Custom for some thou∣sands
of <HI>Frenchmen</HI> to go about the Beginning of
<HI>March</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> and having tilled the Lands
and gathered the Harvest of <HI>Spain,</HI> to return home
with Money in their Pockets, about the End of
<HI>November?</HI></P>
<P>526. Whether of late Years our <HI>Irish</HI> Labour∣ers
do not carry on the same Business in <HI>England,</HI>
to the great Discontent of many there? But whe∣ther
we have not much more Reason than the Peo∣ple
of <HI>England</HI> to be displeased at this Com∣merce?</P>
<P>527. Whether, notwithstanding the Cash sup∣posed
to be brought into it, any Nation is, in truth,
a Gainer by such Traffic?</P>
<P>528. Whether the Industry of our People em∣ployed
in foreign Lands, while our own are left un∣cultivated,
be not a great Loss to the Country?</P>
<P>529. Whether it would not be much better for
us, if, instead of sending our Men abroad, we could
draw Men from the neighbouring Countries to cul∣tivate
our own?</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="173"/>
530. Whether, nevertheless, we are not apt to
think the Money imported by our Labourers to be
so much clear Gains to this Country; but whether
a little Reflexion and a little political Arithmetic,
may not shew us our Mistake?</P>
<P>531. Whether our Prejudices about Gold and
Silver are not very apt to infect or misguide our
Judgments and Reasonings about the public Weal?</P>
<P>532. Whether it be not a good Rule whereby
to judge of the Trade of any City, and its Useful∣ness,
to observe whether there is a Circulation
through the Extremities, and whether the People
round about are busy and warm?</P>
<P>533. Whether we had not, some Years since, a
Manufacture of Hats at <HI>Athlone,</HI> and of Earthen-Ware
at <HI>Arklow,</HI> and what became of those Manu∣facures?</P>
<P>534. Why do we not make Tiles of our own,
for Flooring and Roofing, rather than bring them
from <HI>Holland?</HI></P>
<P>535. What Manufactures are there in <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Venice</HI> of gilt Leather, how cheap and how splen∣did
a Furniture?</P>
<P>536. Whether we may not for the same Use,
manufacture divers Things at home, of more Beau∣ty
and Variety than Wainscot, which is imported at
such Expence from <HI>Norway?</HI></P>
<P>537. Whether the Use and the Fashion will not
soon make a Manufacture?</P>
<P>538. Whether if our Gentry used to drink Mead
and Cider, we should not soon have those Liquors
in the utmost Perfection and Plenty?</P>
<P>539. Whether it be not wonderful, that with
such Pastures, and so many black Cattle, we do not
find ourselves in Cheese?</P>
<P>540. Whether great Profits may not be made by
Fisheries? but whether those of our <HI>Irish</HI> who live
<PB N="179" REF="174"/>
by that Business, do not contrive to be drunk and
unemployed, one half of the Year?</P>
<P>541. Whether it be not Folly to think, an in∣ward
Commerce cannot enrich a State, because it
doth not increase its Quantity of Gold and Silver?
And whether it is possible a Country should not
thrive, while Wants are supplied, and Business goes
on?</P>
<P>542. Whether Plenty of all the Necessaries and
Comforts of Life be not real Wealth?</P>
<P>543. Whether <HI>Lions</HI> by the Advantage of her
midland Situation and the Rivers <HI>Rhone</HI> and <HI>Sone,</HI>
be not a great Magazine, or Mart for inward Com∣merce?
And whether she doth not maintain a con∣stant
Trade with most Parts of <HI>France;</HI> with <HI>Pro∣vence</HI>
for Oils and dried Fruits, for Wines and Cloth
I with <HI>Languedoc,</HI> for Stuffs with <HI>Champaign,</HI> for Li∣nen
with <HI>Picardy, Normandy</HI> and <HI>Bretagny,</HI> for Corn
with <HI>Burgundy?</HI></P>
<P>544. Whether she doth not receive and utter all
those Commodities, and raise a Profit from the Dis∣tribution
thereof, as well as of her own Manufac∣tures,
throughout the Kingdom of <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P>545. Whether the Charge of making good
Roads and navigable Rivers across the Country,
would not be really repaid by an inward Com∣merce?</P>
<P>546. Whether as our Trade and Manufactures
increased, Magazines should not be established in
proper Places, fitted by their Situation, near great
Roads and navigable Rivers, Lakes or Canals, for
the ready Reception and Distribution of all Sorts of
Commodities, from and to the several Parts of the
Kingdom; and whether the Town of <HI>Athlone,</HI> for
Instance, may not be fitly situated for such a Ma∣gazine,
or Centre of domestic Commerce?</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="175"/>
547. Whether an inward Trade would not cause
Industry to flourish, and multiply the Circulation
of our Coin, and whether this may not do as well
as multiplying the Coin itself?</P>
<P>548. Whether the Benefits of a domestic Com∣merce
are sufficiently understood and attended to,
and whether the Cause thereof be not the preju∣diced
and narrow Way of thinking about Gold and
Silver?</P>
<P>549. Whether there be any other more easy and
unenvied Method of increasing the Wealth of a
People?</P>
<P>550. Whether we of this Island are not from
our peculiar Circumstances determined to this very
Commerce above any other, from the Number of
Necessaries and good Things that we possess within
ourselves, from the Extent and Variety of our Soil,
from the navigable Rivers and good Roads which
we have or may have, at a less Expence than any
People in <HI>Europe,</HI> from our great Plenty of Mate∣rials
for Manufactures, and particularly from the
Restraints we lie under with regard to our foreign
Trade?</P>
<P>551. Whether annual Inventories should not be
published of the Fairs throughout the Kingdom, in
order to judge of the Growth of its Commerce?</P>
<P>552. Whether there be not every Year more
Cash circulated at the Card-Tables of <HI>Dublin,</HI> than
at all the Fairs of <HI>Ireland?</HI></P>
<P>553. Whether the Wealth of a Country will not
bear Proportion to the Skill and Industry of its
Inhabitants?</P>
<P>554. Whether foreign Imports that tend to pro∣mote
Industry should not be encouraged, and such as
have a Tendency to promote Luxury should not be
discouraged?</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="176"/>
555. Whether the annual Balance of Trade be∣tween
<HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Lions</HI> be not about four Millions in
Favour of the former, and yet, whether <HI>Lions</HI> be
not a Gainer by this Trade?</P>
<P>556. Whether the general Rule, of determining
the Profit of a Commerce by its Balance, doth
not, like other general Rules, admit of Excep∣tions?</P>
<P>557. Whether it would not be a monstrous Fol∣ly
to import nothing but Gold and Silver, supposing
we might do it, from every foreign Part to which
we trade? And yet, whether some Men may
not think this foolish Circumstance a very happy
one?</P>
<P>558. But whether we do not all see the Ridicule
of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects, who take from us nothing
but our Silver, and bury it under Ground, in order
to make sure thereof against the Resurrection?</P>
<P>559. Whether he must not be a wrong-headed
Patriot or Politician, whose ultimate View was
drawing Money into a Country, and keeping it
there?</P>
<P>560. Whether it be not evident, that not Gold
but Industry causeth a Country to flourish?</P>
<P>561. Whether it would not be a silly Project in
any Nation, to hope to grow rich by prohibiting
the Exportation of Gold and Silver?</P>
<P>562. Whether there can be a greater Mistake
in Politics, than to measure the Wealth of the Na∣tion
by its Gold and Silver?</P>
<P>563. Whether Gold and Silver be not a Drug,
where they do not promote Industry? Whether
they be not even the Bane and undoing of an idle
People?</P>
<P>564. Whether Gold will not cause either Indus∣try
or Vice to flourish? And whether a Country,
where it flowed in without Labour, must not be
<PB N="182" REF="177"/>
wretched and dissolute like an Island inhabited by
Buccaneers?</P>
<P>565. Whether Arts and Virtue are not likely to
thrive, where Money is made a Means to Industry?
But whether Money without this would be a Bles∣sing
to any People?</P>
<P>566. Whether keeping Cash at home, or send∣ing
it abroad, just as it most serves to promote In∣dustry,
be not the real Interest of every Nation?</P>
<P>567. Whether Commodities of all Kinds do not
naturally flow where there is the greatest Demand?
Whether the greatest Demand for a Thing be not
where it is of most Use? Whether Money, like
other Things, hath not its proper Use? Whether
this Use be not to circulate? Whether therefore
there must not of course be Money where there is a
Circulation of Industry?</P>
<P>568. Whether it is not a great Point to know
what we would be at? And whether whole States,
as well as private Persons, do not often fluctuate
for want of this Knowledge?</P>
<P>569. Whether Gold may not be compared to
<HI>Sejanus</HI>'s Horse, if we consider its Passage through
the World, and the Fate of those Nations which
have been successively possessed thereof?</P>
<P>570. Whether Means are not so far useful as
they answer the End? And whether, in different
Circumstances, the same Ends are not obtained by
different Means?</P>
<P>571. If we are a poor Nation, abounding with
very poor People, will it not follow, that a far
greater Proportion of our Stock should be in the
smallest and lowest Species, than would suit with
<HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>572. Whether, therefore, it would not be high∣ly
expedient, if our Money were coined of pecu∣liar
Values, best fitted to the Circumstances and
<PB N="183" REF="178"/>
Uses of our own Country; and whether any other
People could take Umbrage at our consulting our
own Convenience, in an Affair entirely domestic,
and that lies within ourselves?</P>
<P>573. Whether every Man doth not know, and
hath not long known, that the Want of a Mint
causech many other Wants in this Kingdom?</P>
<P>574. What Harm did <HI>England</HI> sustain about three
Centuries ago, when Silver was coined in this
Kingdom?</P>
<P>575. What Harm was it to <HI>Spain</HI> that her Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> had all along Mints of
their own?</P>
<P>576. Whether it may not be presumed, that our
not, haying a Privilege, which every other King∣dom
in the World enjoys, be not owing to our
own want of Diligence and Unanimity in soliciting
for it?</P>
<P>577. Whether it be not the Interest of <HI>England,</HI>
that we should cultivate a domestic Commerce
among ourselves? And whether it could give them
any possible Jealousy, if our small Sum of Cash was
contrived to go a little further, if there was a little
more Life in our Markets, a little more buying
and selling in our Shops, a little better Provision
for the Backs and Bellies of so many forlorn
Wretches throughput the Towns and Villages of
this Island?</P>
<P>578. Whether <HI>Great Britain</HI> ought not to pro∣mote
the Prosperity of her Colonies, by all Me∣thods
consistent with her own? And whether the
Colonies themselves ought to wish or aim at it by
others?</P>
<P>579. Whether the remotest Parts from the Me∣tropolis,
and the lowest of the People, are not to be
regarded as the Extremities and Capillaries of
the political Body?</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="179"/>
580. Whether, although the capillary Vessels
are small, yet Obstructions in them do not produce
great chronical Diseases?</P>
<P>581. Whether Faculties are not enlarged and
improved by Exercise?</P>
<P>582. Whether the Sum of the Faculties put into
Act, or in other Words, the united Action of a
whole People doth not constitute the <HI>Momentum</HI> of
a State?</P>
<P>583. Whether such <HI>Momentum</HI> be not the real
Stock or Wealth of a State; and whether its Cre∣dit
be not proportionable thereunto?</P>
<P>584. Whether in every wise State the Faculties
of the Mind are not most considered?</P>
<P>585. Whether the <HI>Momentum</HI> of a State doth
not imply the whole Exertion of its Faculties, intel∣lectual
and corporeal; and whether the latter with∣out
the former, could act in concert?</P>
<P>586. Whether the divided Force of Men, act∣ing
singly, would not be a Rope of Sand?</P>
<P>587. Whether the particular Motions of the
Members of a State, in opposite Directions, will
not destroy each other, and lessen the <HI>Momentum</HI> of
the whole; but whether they must not conspire to
produce a great Effect?</P>
<P>588. Whether the ready Means to put Spirit in∣to
this State, to fortify and increase its <HI>Momentum,</HI>
would not be a national Bank, and Plenty of small
Cash?</P>
<P>589. Whether that which employs and exerts
the Force of a Community, deserves, not to be
well considered and well understood?</P>
<P>590. Whether the immediate Mover, the Blood
and Spirits, be not Money, Paper or Metal, and
whether the Soul or Will of the Community, which
is the prime Mover that governs and directs the
Whole, be not the Legislature?</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="180"/>
591. Supposing the Inhabitants of a Country
quite sunk in Sloth, or even fast asleep, whether
upon the gradual Awakening and Exertion, first,
of the sensitive and locomotive Faculties, next of
Reason and Reflexion, then of Justice and Piety,
the <HI>Momentum</HI> of such Country or State, would not,
in Proportion thereunto, become still more and
more considerable?</P>
<P>592. Whether that which in the Growth is last
attained, and is the finishing Perfection of a People,
be not the first Thing lost in their Declension?</P>
<P>593. Whether Force be not of Consequence, as
it is exerted; and whether great Force without
great Wisdom may not be a Nusance?</P>
<P>594. Whether the Force of a Child applied with
Art, may not produce greater Effects than that of
a Giant? And whether a small Stock in the Hands
of a wise State, may not go further, and produce
more considerable Effects, than immense Sums in
the Hands of a foolish one?</P>
<P>595. Whose Fault is it if poor <HI>Ireland</HI> still con∣tinues
poor?</P>

<HEAD>A PROPOSAL
FOR
The better Supplying of Churches in
our foreign Plantations, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH there are several excellent
Persons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> whose
good Intentions and Endeavours have not been
wanting to propagate the Gospel in foreign Parts,
who have even combined into Societies for that very
Purpose, and given great Encouragement, not only
for <HI>English</HI> Missionaries in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but also,
for the Reformed of other Nations, led by their
Example, to propagate Christianity in the <HI>East:</HI>
It is nevertheless acknowledged, that there is at
this Day, but little Sense of Religion, and a most
notorious Corruption of Manners, in the <HI>English</HI>
Colonies settled on the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and
the Islands. It is also acknowledged, that the
Gospel hath hitherto made but a very inconsiderable
Progress among the neighbouring <HI>Americans,</HI> who
still continue in much the same Ignorance and Bar∣barism,
<PB N="192" REF="185"/>
in which we found them above a hundred
Years ago.</P>
<P>I shall therefore venture to submit my Thoughts
upon a Point, that I have long considered, to better
Judgments, in Hopes that any Expedient will be
favourably hearkened to, which is proposed for the
Remedy of these Evils. Now, in order to effect
this, it should seem the natural proper Method, to
provide, in the first Place, a constant Supply of
worthy Clergymen for the <HI>English</HI> Churches in those
Parts; and in the second Place, a like constant
Supply of zealous Missionaries, well fitted for pro∣pagating
Christianity among the Savages.</P>
<P>For though the surest Means to reform the
Morals, and soften the Behaviour of Men, be, to
preach to them the pure uncorrupt Doctrine of the
Gospel, yet it cannot be denied, that the Success of
preaching dependeth in good measure on the Cha∣racter
and Skill of the Preacher: Forasmuch as
Mankind are more apt to copy Characters than to
practise Precepts, and forasmuch as Argument, to
attain its full Strength, doth not less require the Life
of Zeal, than the Weight of Reason; and the same
Doctrine, which maketh great Impression, when
delivered with Decency and Address, loseth very
much of its Force by passing through aukward or
unskilful Hands.</P>
<P>Now the Clergy sent over to <HI>America</HI> have proved,
too many of them, very meanly qualified both in
Learning and Morals for the Discharge of their
Office. And indeed little can be expected from the
Example or Instruction of those, who quit their
native Country on no other Motive, than that they
are not able to procure a Livelihood in it, which is
known to be often the Case.</P>
<P>To this may be imputed the small Care that hath
been taken to convert the Negroes of our Planta∣tions,
<PB N="193" REF="186"/>
who, to the Infamy of <HI>England,</HI> and Scandal
of the World, continue Heathen under Christian
Masters, and in Christian Countries. Which could
never be, if our Planters were rightly instructed
and made sensible, that they disappointed their own
Baptism by denying it to those who belong to them:
That it would be of Advantage to their Affairs, to
have Slaves who should <HI>obey in all Things their
Masters according to the Flesh, not with Eye-service
as Men-pleasers, but in Singleness of Heart as fear∣ing
God:</HI> That Gospel Liberty consists with temporal
Servitude; and that their Slaves would only become
better Slaves by being Christians.</P>
<P>And though it be allowed that some of the Clergy
in our Colonies have approved themselves Men of
Merit, it will at the same time be allowed, that the
most zealous and able Missionary from <HI>England</HI> must
find himself but ill qualified for converting the
<HI>American</HI> Heathen, if we consider the Difference of
Language, their wild Way of Living, and above
all, the great Jealousy and Prejudice which savage
Nations have towards Foreigners, or Innovations
introduced by them.</P>
<P>These Considerations make it evident, that a
College or Seminary in those Parts is very much
wanted; and therefore the providing such a Semi∣nary,
is earnestly proposed and recommended to all
those, who have it in their Power to
contribute to so good a Work. By this, two Ends would be
obtained.</P>
<P>First, the Youth of our <HI>English</HI> Plantations
might be themselves fitted for the Ministry; and
Men of Merit would be then glad to fill the
Churches of their native Country, which are now
a Drain for the very Dregs and Refuse of ours.</P>
<P>At present, there are, I am told, many Churches
vacant in our Plantations, and many very ill sup∣plied;
<PB N="194" REF="187"/>
nor can all the Vigilance and Wisdom of
that great Prelate, whose peculiar Care it is, pre∣vent
this, so long as the aforesaid Churches are
supplied from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And supplied they must be, with such as can be
picked up in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> until a Nursery of
Learning for the Education of the Natives is
founded. This indeed might provide a constant
Succession of learned and exemplary Pastors; and
what Effect this must be supposed to have on their
Flocks, I need not say.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Children of savage <HI>Americans,</HI>
brought up in such a Seminary, and well instructed
in Religion and Learning, might make the ablest
and properest Missionaries for spreading the Gospel
among their Countrymen; who would be less apt
to suspect, and readier to embrace a Doctrine re∣commended
by Neighbours or Relations, Men of
their own Blood and Language, than if it were pro∣posed
by Foreigners, who would not improbably be
thought to have Designs on the Liberty or Property
of their Converts.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Americans</HI> necessary for this Purpose,
may in the Beginning be procured, either by
peaceable Methods from those savage Nations,
which border on our Colonies, and are in Friend∣ship
with us, or by taking captive the Children of
our Enemies.</P>
<P>It is proposed to admit into the aforesaid College
only such Savages as are under ten Years of Age,
before evil Habits have taken a deep root; and yet
not so early as to prevent retaining their Mother
Tongue, which should be preserved by Intercourse
among themselves.</P>
<P>It is further proposed, to ground these young
<HI>Americans</HI> thoroughly in Religion and Morality,
and to give them a good Tincture of other Learn∣ing;

particularly of Eloquence, History, and prac∣tical
Mathematicks; to which it may not be im∣proper
to add some Skill in Physic.</P>
<P>If there were a yearly Supply of ten or a dozen
such Missionaries sent abroad into their respective
Countries, after they had received the Degree of
Master of Arts in the aforesaid College, and Holy
Orders in <HI>England,</HI> (till such Time as Episcopacy
be established in those Parts) it is hardly to be doubt∣ed,
but, in a little time, the World would see
good and great Effects thereof.</P>
<P>For, to any considering Man, the employing
<HI>American</HI> Missionaries for the Conversion of <HI>America,</HI>
will, of all others, appear the most likely Method
to succeed; especially if care be taken, that, dur∣ing
the whole Course of their Education, an Eye
should be had to their Mission; that they should
be taught betimes to consider themselves as trained
up in that sole View, without any other Prospect
of Provision, or Employment; that a Zeal for
Religion, and Love of their Country, should be
early and constantly instilled into their Minds, by
repeated Lectures and Admonitions; that they
should not only be incited by the common Topics
of Religion and Nature, but farther animated and
inflamed by the great Examples in past Ages, of
public Spirit and Virtue, to rescue their Country∣men
from their savage Manners, to a Life of Ci∣vility
and Religion.</P>
<P>If his Majesty would graciously please to grant a
Charter for a College to be erected in a proper
Place for these Uses, it is to be hoped a Fund may
be soon raised, by the Contribution of well dis∣posed
Persons, sufficient for building and endowing
the same. For as the necessary Expence would be
small, so there are Men of Religion and Humanity
in <HI>England,</HI> who would be pleased to see any Design
<PB N="196" REF="189"/>
set forward for the Glory of God and the Good of
Mankind.</P>
<P>A small Expence would suffice to subsist and
educate the <HI>American</HI> Missionaries in a plain simple
Manner, such as might make it easy for them to
return to the coarse and poor Methods of Life in
use among their Countrymen; and nothing can
contribute more to lessen this Expence, than a ju∣dicious
Choice of the Situation, where the Seminary
is to stand.</P>
<P>Many Things ought to be considered in the
Choice of a Situation. It should be in a good
Air; in a Place where Provisions are cheap and
plenty; where an Intercourse might easily be kept
up with all Parts of <HI>America</HI> and the Islands; in a
Place of Security, not exposed to the Insults of
Pirates, Savages, or other Enemies; where there
is no great Trade, which might tempt the Readers
or Fellows of the College to become Merchants,
to the Neglect of their proper Business; where
there are neither Riches nor Luxury to divert, or
lessen their Application, or to make them uneasy
and dissatisfied with a homely frugal Subsistence;
lastly, where the Inhabitants, if such a Place may be
found, are noted for Innocence and Simplicity of
Manners. I need not say of how great Importance
this Point would be toward forming the Morals of
young Students, and what mighty Influence it must
have on the Mission.</P>
<P>It is evident the College long since projected in
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> would be defective in many of these
Particulars; for though it may have its Use among
the Inhabitants, yet a Place of so high Trade, so
much Wealth and Luxury, and such dissolute
Morals, (not to mention the great Price and Scarcity
of Provisions;) must at first Sight seem a very im∣proper
Situation for a general Seminary intended
<PB N="197" REF="190"/>
for the forming Missionaries, and educating Youth
in Religion and Sobriety of Manners. The same
Objections lie against the neighbouring Islands.</P>
<P>And if we consider the Accounts given of their
Avarice and Licentiousness, their Coldness in the
Practice of Religion, and their Aversion from
propagating it, (which appears in the withholding
their Slaves from Baptism) it is to be feared, that
the Inhabitants in the populous Parts of our Plan∣tations
on the Continent are not much fitter, than
those in the Islands abovementioned, to influence
or assist such a Design. And as to the more remote
and less frequented Parts, the Difficulty of being
supplied with Necessaries, the Danger of being ex∣posed
to the Inroads of Savages, and above all, the
Want of Intercourse with other Places, render
them improper Situations for a Seminary of Re∣ligion
and Learning.</P>
<P>It will not be amiss to insert here an Observation
I remember to have seen in an Abstract of the
Proceedings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> annexed to the Dean of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>'s
Sermon, before the Society for the Propa∣gation
of the Gospel in foreign Parts; that the
savage <HI>Indians,</HI> who live on the Continent, will not
suffer their Children to learn <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> lest
they should be debauched by conversing with
their <HI>European</HI> Neighbours; which is a melancholy
but strong Confirmation of the Truth of what hath
been now advanced.</P>
<P>A general Intercourse and Correspondence with
all the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, both on the Islands and
the Continent, and with other Parts of <HI>America,</HI>
hath been before laid down, as a necessary Circum∣stance,
the Reason whereof is very evident. But
this Circumstance is hardly to be found. For on
the Continent, where there are neither Inns, nor
Carriages, nor Bridges over the Rivers, there is
<PB N="198" REF="191"/>
no travelling by Land between distant Places.
And the <HI>English</HI> Settlements are reputed to extend
along the Sea-coast for the Space of fifteen hun∣dred
Miles. It is therefore plain, there can be
no convenient Communication between them,
otherwise than by Sea; no Advantage therefore,
in this Point, can be gained by settling on the
Continent.</P>
<P>There is another Consideration which equally
regards the Continent and Islands, that the general
Course of Trade and Correspondence lies from all
those Colonies to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> alone: Whereas,
for our present Purpose, it would be necessary to
pitch upon a Place, if such could be found, which
maintains a constant Intercourse with all the other
Colonies, and whose Commerce lies chiefly or alto∣gether
(not in <HI>Europe,</HI> but) in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one Spot that I can find, to which
this Circumstance agrees; and that is the Isles of
<HI>Bermuda,</HI> otherwise called <HI>The Summer Islands.</HI> These
having no rich Commodity or Manufacture, such as
Sugar, Tobacco, or the like, wherewithal to trade
to <HI>England,</HI> are obliged to become Carriers for
<HI>America,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are for <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Ber∣mudans</HI>
are excellent Shipwrights and Sailors, and
have a great Number of very good Sloops, which
are always passing and repassing from all Parts of
<HI>America.</HI> They drive a constant Trade to the
Islands of <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antego,</HI> &amp;c. with
Butter, Onions, Cabbages, and other Roots and
Vegetables, which they have in great Plenty and
Perfection. They have also some small Manu∣factures
of Joiners Work and Matting, which
they export to the Plantations on the Continent.
Hence <HI>Bermudan</HI> Sloops are oftner seen in the Ports
of <HI>America,</HI> than any other. And indeed, by the
best Information I could get, it appears they are the
<PB N="199" REF="192"/>
only People of all the <HI>British</HI> Plantations, who hold
a general Correspondence with the rest.</P>
<P>And, as the Commerce of <HI>Bermuda</HI> renders it a
very fit Place, wherein to erect a Seminary, so
likewise doth its Situation, it being placed between
our Plantations on the Continent, and those in the
Isles, so as equally to respect both. To
which may be added, that it lies in the Way of Vessels
passing from <HI>America</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> all which
makes it plain, that the Youth, to be educated in
a Seminary placed in the <HI>Summer Islands,</HI> would
have frequent Opportunities of going thither and
corresponding with their Friends. It must indeed
be owned, that some will be obliged to go a long
Way to any one Place, which we suppose resorted
to, from all Parts of our Plantations; but if we
were to look out a Spot the nearest approaching
to an equal Distance from all the rest, I believe it
would be found to be <HI>Bermuda.</HI> It remains, that
we see whether it enjoys the other Qualities or Con∣ditions
laid down as well as this.</P>
<P><HI>The Summer Islands</HI> are situated near the Latitude
of thirty three Degrees; no Part of the World
enjoys a purer Air, or a more temperate Climate,
the great Ocean which environs them, at once mo∣derating
the Heat of the South Winds, and the
Severity of the North-West. Such a Latitude on
the Continent might be thought too hot; but the
Air in <HI>Bermuda</HI> is perpetually fanned and kept cool
by Sea-breezes, which render the Weather the most
healthy and delightful that could be wished, being,
(as is affirmed by Persons who have long lived there)
of one equal Tenour almost throughout the whole
Year, like the latter End of a fine <HI>May;</HI> insomuch
that it is resorted to as the <HI>Montpellier</HI> of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are these Isles (if we may believe the Ac∣counts
given of them) less remarkable for Plenty
<PB N="200" REF="193"/>
than for Health; there being, besides Beef, Mut∣ton
and Fowl, great Abundance of Fruits, and
Garden-stuff of all Kinds in Perfection: To this,
if we add the great Plenty and Variety of Fish,
which is every Day taken on their Coasts, it would
seem, that a Seminary could no where be supplied
with better Provisions, or cheaper than here.</P>
<P>About forty Years ago, upon cutting down many
tall Cedars that sheltered their Orange-trees from
the North-West Wind, (which sometimes blows
even there, so as to affect that delicate Plant)
great Part of their Orange Plantations suffered; but
other Cedars are since grown up, and no doubt, a
little Industry would again produce as great Plenty
of Oranges as ever was there heretofore. I men∣tion
this, because some have inferred from the
present Scarcity of that Fruit, for which <HI>Bermuda</HI>
was once so famous, that there hath been a change
in the Soil and Climate for the worse. But this,
as hath been observed, proceeded from another
Cause, which is now in great measure taken away.</P>
<P><HI>Bermuda</HI> is a Cluster of small Islands, which lie
in a very narrow Compass, containing in all, not
quite twenty thousand Acres. This Groupe of Isles
is (to use Mr. <HI>Waller</HI>'s Expression) walled round
with Rocks, which render them inaccessible to Pi∣rates
or Enemies; there being but two narrow
Entrances, both well guarded by Forts. It would
therefore be impossible to find any where, a more
secure Retreat for Students.</P>
<P>The Trade of <HI>Bermuda</HI> consists only in
Gardenstuff, and some poor Manufactures, principally of
Cedar and the Palmetto-leaf. <HI>Bermuda</HI> Hats are
worn by our Ladies: They are made of a Sort of
Mat, or (as they call it) Platting made of the Pal∣metto-leaf,
which is the only Commodity that I
can find exported from <HI>Bermuda</HI> to <HI>Great-Britain;</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="194"/>
and as there is no Prospect; of making a Fortune by
this small Trade, so it cannot be supposed to tempt
the Fellows of the College to engage in it, to the
Neglect of their peculiar Business, which might
possibly be the Case elsewhere.</P>
<P>Such as their Trade is, such is their Wealth;
the Inhabitants being much poorer than the other
Colonies, who do not fail to despise them upon
that Account. But if they have less Wealth, they
have withal less Vice and expensive Folly than
their Neighbours. They are represented as a con∣tented,
plain, innocent Sort of People, free from
Avarice and Luxury, as well as the other Corruptions
that attend those Vices.</P>
<P>I am also informed, that they are more constant
Attendants on divine Service, more kind and re∣spectful
to their Pastor (when they have one) and
shew much more Humanity to their Slaves, and
Charity to one another, than is observed among
the <HI>English</HI> in the other Plantations: One Reason
of this may be, that condemned Criminals, being
employed in the Manufactures of Sugar and To∣bacco,
were never transported thither. But, what∣ever
be the Cause, the Facts are attested by a
Clergyman of good Credit, who lived long among
them.</P>
<P>Among a People of this Character, and in a
Situation thus circumstantiated, it would seem that
a Seminary of Religion and Learning might very
fitly be placed. The Correspondence with other
Parts of <HI>America,</HI> the Goodness of the Air, the
Plenty and Security of the Place, the Frugality and
Innocence of the Inhabitants, all conspiring to fa∣vour
such a Design. Thus much at least is evident,
that young Students would be there less liable to
be corrupted in their Morals; and the governing
Part would be easier, and better contented with a
<PB N="202" REF="195"/>
small Stipend, and a retired academical Life, in a
Corner from whence Avarice and Luxury are ex∣cluded,
than they can be supposed to be in the
midst of a full Trade and great Riches, attended
with all that high Living and Parade which our
Planters affect, and which, as well as all fashionable
Vices, should be far removed from the Eyes of
the young <HI>American</HI> Missionaries, who are to lead
a Life of Poverty and Self-denial among their
Countrymen.</P>
<P>After all, it must be acknowledged, that though
every Thing else should concur with our Wishes,
yet if a Set of good Governors and Teachers be
wanting, who are acquainted with the Methods of
Education, and have the Zeal and Ability requisite
for carrying on a Design of this Nature, it would
certainly come to nothing.</P>
<P>An Institution of this Kind should be set on
Foot by Men of Prudence, Spirit and Zeal, as well
as competent Learning, who should be led to it
by other Motives than the Necessity of picking up
a Maintenance. For upon this View, what Man of
Merit can be supposed to quit his native Country,
and take up with a poor College Subsistence in
another Part of the World, where there are so
many considerable Parishes actually void, and so
many others ill supplied for want of fitting In∣cumbents?
Is it likely, that Fellowships of fifty
or sixty Pounds a Year should tempt abler or wor∣thier
Men, than Benefices of many Times their Value?</P>
<P>And except able and worthy Men do first engage
in this Affair, with a Resolution to exert themselves
in forming the Manners of the Youth, and giving
them a proper Education, it is evident the Mission
and the College will be but in a very bad Way.
This Inconvenience seems the most difficult to pro∣vide
<PB N="204" REF="196"/>
against, and, if not provided against, it will
be the most likely to obstruct any Design of this
Nature. So true it is, that where Ignorance or ill
Manners once take place in a Seminary, they are
sure to be handed down in a Succession of illiterate
or worthless Men.</P>
<P>But this Apprehension, which seems so well
grounded, that a College in any Part of <HI>America,</HI>
would either lie unprovided, or be worse provided
than their Churches are, hath no Place in <HI>Bermuda;</HI>
there being at this Time several Gentlemen, in all
Respects very well qualified, and in Possession of
good Preferments, and fair Prospects at home, who
having seriously considered the great Benefit that
may arise to the Church and to Mankind from such
an Undertaking, are ready to engage in it, and to
dedicate the Remainder of their Lives to the in∣structing
the Youth of <HI>America,</HI> and prosecuting
their own Studies upon a very moderate Subsistence
in a Retirement, so sweet and so secure, and every
way so well fitted for a Place of Education and
Study, as <HI>Bermuda.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much the Writer hereof thought himself
obliged to say of his Associates: For himself, he
can only say, that as he values no Preferment upon
Earth, so much as that of being employed in
the Execution of this Design; so he hopes to
make up for other Defects, by the Sincerity of his
Endeavours.</P>
<P>In <HI>Europe,</HI> the Protestant Religion hath of late
Years considerably lost ground, and <HI>America</HI> seems
the likeliest Place, wherein to make up for what
hath been lost in <HI>Europe,</HI> provided the proper
Methods are taken: Otherwise the <HI>Spanish</HI> Missi∣onaries
in the South, and the <HI>French</HI> in the North,
are making such a Progress, as may one Day
spread the Religion of <HI>Rome,</HI> and with it the usual
<PB N="202" REF="197"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="204" REF="198"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="204" REF="199"/>
Hatred to Protestants, throughout all the savage
Nations in <HI>America;</HI> which would probably end in
the utter Extirpation of our Colonies, on the Safety
whereof depends so much of the Nation's Wealth,
and so considerable a Branch of his Majesty's Re∣venue.</P>
<P>But if this Scheme were pursued, it would in
all probability have much greater Influence on the
<HI>Americans,</HI> than the utmost Endeavours of Popish
Emissaries can possibly have; who from the Dif∣ference
of Country, Language and Interest, must
lie under far greater Difficulties and Discourage∣ments
than those, whom we suppose yearly sent
out from <HI>Bermuda</HI> to preach among their Coun∣trymen.</P>
<P>It cannot indeed be denied, that the great Num∣ber
of poor Regulars, inured to hard Living, and
brought up in an implicit Obedience to their Su∣periors,
hath hitherto given the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
in regard to her Missions, great Advantage over
the Reformed Churches. But from what hath been
said, it is, I think, evident, that this Advantage
may be over-balanced by our employing <HI>American</HI>
Missionaries.</P>
<P>Nor is the Honour of the Crown, Nation, and
Church of <HI>England</HI> unconcerned in this Scheme;
which, it is to be hoped, will remove the Reproach,
we have so long lain under, that we fall as far short
of our Neighbours of the <HI>Romish</HI> Communion in
Zeal for propagating Religion, as we surpass them
in the Soundness and Purity of it. And at the same
time, that the doing what may be so easily done,
takes away our Reproach; it will cast no small
Lustre on his Majesty's Reign, and derive a Blessing
from Heaven on his Administration and those who
live under the Influence thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="200"/>
Men of narrow Minds have a peculiar Talent at
Objection, being never at a loss for something to
say against whatsoever is not of their own proposing.
And perhaps, it will be said in Opposition to this
Proposal, that if we thought ourselves capable of
gaining Converts to the Church, we ought to begin
with Infidels, Papists, and Dissenters of all De∣nominations
at home, and to make Proselytes of
these before we think of Foreigners; and that there∣fore
our Scheme is against Duty. And further,
that considering the great Opposition, which is
found on the Part of those who differ from us at
home, no Success can be expected among Savages
abroad, and that therefore it is against Reason and
Experience.</P>
<P>In answer to this I say, that Religion like Light
is imparted without being diminished. That what∣ever
is done abroad, can be no Hindrance or Lett
to the Conversion of Infidels or others at home.
That those who engage in this Affair, imagine they
will not be missed, where there is no want of
Schools or Clergy; but that they may be of singu∣lar
Service in Countries but thinly supplied with
either, or altogether deprived of both: That our
Colonies being of the same Blood, Language and
Religion, with ourselves, are in effect our Country∣men.
But that Christian Charity, not being limited
by those Regards, doth extend to all Mankind.
And this may serve for an Answer to the first Point,
that our Design is against Duty.</P>
<P>To the second Point I answer: That Ignorance
is not so incurable as Error; that you must pull
down as well as build, erase as well as imprint, in
order to make Proselytes at home: Whereas, the
savage <HI>Americans,</HI> if they are in a State purely na∣tural,
and unimproved by Education, they are also
unincumbred with all that Rubbish of Superstition
<PB N="206" REF="201"/>
and Prejudice, which is the Effect of a wrong one.
As they are less instructed, they are withal less
conceited and more teachable. And not being
violently attached to any false System of their own,
are so much the fitter to receive that which is true.
Hence it is evident, that Success abroad ought not
to be measured by that which we observe at home,
and that the Inference, which was made from the
Difficulty of the one to the Impossibility of the
other, is altogether groundless.</P>
<P>It hath more the Appearance of Reason to object
(what will possibly be objected by some) that this
Scheme hath been already tried to no Purpose, se∣veral
<HI>Indians</HI> having returned to their savage Man∣ners
after they had been taught to write and read,
and instructed in the Christian Religion; a clear
Proof that their natural Stupidity is not to be over∣come
by Education.</P>
<P>In answer to this, I say that the Scheme now
proposed hath never been tried, forasmuch as a
thorough Education in Religion and Morality, in
divine and human Learning, doth not appear to
have been ever given to any savage <HI>American:</HI> That
much is to be hoped from a Man ripe in Years,
and well grounded in Religion and useful Know∣ledge,
while little or nothing can be expected from
a Youth but slightly instructed in the Elements of
either: That from the Miscarriage or gross Stu∣pidity
of some, a general Incapacity of all <HI>Americans</HI>
cannot be fairly inferred: That they shew as much
natural Sense as other uncultivated Nations: That
the Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> were evident
Proofs of their Capacity, in which there appeared
a Reach of Politics, and a Degree of Art and Po∣liteness,
which no <HI>European</HI> People were ever known
to have arrived at without the Use of Letters or of
<PB N="207" REF="202"/>
Iron, and which some perhaps have fallen short of
with both those Advantages.</P>
<P>To what hath been said, it may not be improper
to add, that young <HI>Americans,</HI> educated in an
Island at some Distance from their own Country,
will more easily be kept under Discipline till they
have attained a compleat Education, than on the
Continent; where they might find Opportunities
of running away to their Countrymen, and return∣ing
to their brutal Customs, before they were
thoroughly imbued with good Principles and
Habits.</P>
<P>It must nevertheless be acknowledged a difficult
Attempt, to plant Religion among the <HI>Americans,</HI>
so long as they continue their wild and roving
Life. He who is obliged to hunt for his daily Food,
will have little Curiosity or Leisure to receive In∣struction.
It would seem therefore the right Way,
to introduce Religion and civil Life at the same
Time into that Part of the World: either Attempt
will assist and promote the other. Those therefore
of the young Savages, who upon Trial are found
less likely to improve by academical Studies, may
be taught Agriculture, or the most necessary Trades.
And when Husbandmen, Weavers, Carpenters,
and the like, have planted those useful Arts among
their savage Countrymen, and taught them to live
in settled Habitations, to canton out their Land and
till it, to provide vegetable Food of all Kinds, to
preserve Flocks and Herds of Cattle, to make
convenient Houses, and to clothe themselves decent∣ly:
This will assist the spreading the Gospel among
them; this will dispose them to social Virtues, and
enable them to see and to feel the Advantages of a
religious and civil Education.</P>
<P>And that this View of propagating the Gospel
and civil Life among the savage Nations of <HI>America,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="203"/>
was a principal Motive which induced the Crown
to send the first <HI>English</HI> Colonies thither, doth ap∣pear
from the Charter granted by King <HI>James</HI> I.
to the Adventurers in <HI>Virginia. See</HI> Purchas'<HI>s Pil∣grims,
Vol. 4. b.</HI> I. <HI>c.</HI> 9. And it is now but just
(what might then seem charitable) that these poor
Creatures should receive some Advantage with re∣spect
to their spiritual Interests, from those who
have so much improved their temporal, by settling
among them.</P>
<P>It is most true, notwithstanding our present
Corruptions, that there are to be found in no
Country under the Sun Men of better Inclinations,
or greater Abilities for doing Good, than in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
But it is as true, that Success, in many
Cases, depends not upon Zeal, Industry, Wealth,
Learning, or the like Faculties, so much as on the
Method, wherein these are applied. We often see
a small Proportion of Labour and Expence in one
Way, bring that about, which in others, a much
greater Share of both could never effect. It hath
been my Endeavour to discover this Way or
Method in the present Case. What hath been
done, I submit to the Judgment of all good and
reasonable Men; who, I am persuaded, will never
reject or discourage a Proposal of this Nature, on
the Score of slight Objections, Surmises, or Diffi∣culties,
and thereby render themselves chargeable
with the having prevented those good Effects, which
might otherwise have been produced by it.</P>
<P>For it is, after all, possible, that unforeseen
Difficulties may arise in the Prosecution of this
Design, many Things may retard, and many
Things may threaten to obstruct it; but there is
hardly any Enterprise or Scheme whatsoever, for
the public Good, in which Difficulties are not often
shewing themselves, and as often overcome by the
<PB N="209" REF="204"/>
Blessing of God, upon the Prudence and Resolution
of the Undertakers; though, for ought that ap∣pears,
the present Scheme is as likely to succeed,
and attended with as few Difficulties, as any of this
Kind can possibly be.</P>
<P>For to any Man, who considers the divine Power
of Religion, the innate Force of Reason and Virtue,
and the mighty Effects often wrought by the con∣stant
regular Operation even of a weak and small
Cause; it will seem natural and reasonable to sup∣pose,
that Rivulets perpetually issuing forth from a
Fountain, or Reservoir, of Learning and Religion,
and streaming through all Parts of <HI>America,</HI> must
in due time have a great Effect, in purging away
the ill Manners and Irreligion of our Colonies, as
well as the Blindness and Barbarity of the Nations
round them: Especially, if the Reservoir be in a
clean and private Place, where its Waters, out of
the Way of any Thing that may corrupt them, re∣main
clear and pure; otherwise they are more likely
to pollute than purify the Places through which they
flow.</P>
<P>The Greatness of a Benefaction is rather in Pro∣portion
to the Number and Want of the Receivers,
than to the Liberality of the Giver. A wise and
good Man would therefore be frugal in the Manage∣ment
of his Charity; that is, contrive it so as that
it might extend to the greatest Wants of the greatest
Number of his Fellow-creatures. Now the greatest
Wants are spiritual Wants, and by all Accounts
these are no where greater than in our western Plan∣tations,
in many Parts whereof divine Service is
never performed for want of Clergymen; in others,
after such a Manner and by such Hands, as scan∣dalize
even the worst of their own Parishioners;
where many <HI>English,</HI> instead of gaining Converts,
are themselves degenerated into Heathens, being
<PB N="210" REF="205"/>
Members of no Church, without Morals, with∣out
Faith, without Baptism. There can be there∣fore,
in no Part of the Christian World, a great∣er
Want of spiritual Things than in our Plan∣tations.</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, no Part of the Gen∣tile
World are so inhuman and barbarous as the sa∣vage
<HI>Americans,</HI> whose chief Employment and De∣light
consisting in Cruelty and Revenge, their Lives
must of all others, be most opposite, as well to the
Light of Nature, as to the Spirit of the Gospel.
Now to reclaim these poor Wretches, to prevent
the many Torments and cruel Deaths which they
daily inflict on each other, to contribute in any
sort to put a Stop to the numberless horrid Crimes
which they commit without Remorse, and instead
thereof to introduce the Practice of Virtue and
Piety, must surely be a Work in the highest
Degree becoming every sincere and charitable
Christian.</P>
<P>Those, who wish well to Religion and Mankind,
will need no other Motive to forward an Under∣taking
calculated for the Service of both: I shall,
nevertheless, beg leave to observe, that whoever
would be glad to cover a Multitude of Sins by an
extensive and well-judged Charity, or whoever,
from an excellent and God-like Temper of Mind,
seeks Opportunities of doing Good in his Genera∣tion,
will be pleased to meet with a Scheme that so
peculiarly puts it in his Power, with small Trouble
or Expence, to procure a great and lasting Benefit
to the World.</P>
<P>Ten Pounds a Year, would (if I mistake not) be
sufficient to defray the Expence of a young <HI>Ameri∣can</HI>
in the College of <HI>Bermuda,</HI> as to Diet, Lodg∣ing,
Clothes, Books and Education: And if so,
the Interest of two hundred Pounds may be a per∣petual
<PB N="211" REF="206"/>
Fund for maintaining one Missionary at the
College, for ever; and in this Succession, many,
it is to be hoped, may become powerful Instru∣ments
for converting to Christianity and civil Life
whole Nations, who now sit in Darkness and the
Shadow of Death, and whose cruel brutal Manners
are a Disgrace to human Nature.</P>
<P>A Benefaction of this Kind seems to enlarge the
very Being of a Man, extending it to distant Places
and to future Times; inasmuch as unseen Coun∣tries
and after Ages, may feel the Effects of his
Bounty, while he himself reaps the Reward in the

<BIBL>JOHN xvii. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>This is Life Eternal, that they may know thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT human Kind were not designed meer∣ly
to sojourn a few Days upon this Earth:
that a Being of such Excellence as the Soul of
Man, so capable of a nobler Life, and having such
a high Sense of Things moral and intellectual, was
not created in the sole View of being imprisoned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few Pains
and Pleasures which checker this mortal Life, with∣out
aspiring to any Thing either above or beyond
it, is a fundamental Doctrine as well of natural Re∣ligion
as of the Christian. It comes at once re∣commended
by the Authority of Philosophers and
Evangelists. And that there actually is in the
Mind of Man a strong Instinct and Desire, an Ap∣petite
and Tendency towards another and a better
State, incomparably superior to the present, both
in point of Happiness and Duration, is no more
than every one's Experience and inward Feeling
may inform him. The Satiety and Disrelish at∣tending
sensual Enjoyments, the Relish for Things
of a more pure and spiritual Kind, the restless Mo∣tion
of the Mind, from one terrene Object or Pur∣suit
to another, and often a Flight or Endeavour
above them all towards something unknown, and
perfective of its Nature, are so many Signs and
Tokens of this better State, which in the Stile of
the Gospel is termed Life Eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="211"/>
And as this is the greatest Good that can befal
us, the very End of our Being, and that alone
which can crown and satisfy our Wishes, and with∣out
which we shall be ever restless and uneasy; so
every Man, who knows and acts up to his true In∣terest,
must make it his principal Care and Study
to obtain it: And in order to this, he must endea∣vour
to live suitably to his Calling, and of conse∣quence
endeavour to make others obtain it too.
For how can a Christian shew himself worthy of
his Calling, otherwise than by performing the Du∣ties
of it? And what Christian Duty is more es∣sentially
so, than that of Charity? And what Ob∣ject
can be found upon Earth more deserving our
Charity, than the Souls of Men? Or, how is it
possible for the most beneficent Spirit to do them
better Service, than by promoting their best and
most lasting Interest, that is, by putting them in
the Way that leads to eternal Life.</P>
<P>What this eternal Life was, or how to come at
it, were Points unknown to the Heathen World.
It must be owned, the wise Men of old, who fol∣lowed
the Light of Nature, saw even by that Light,
that the Soul of Man was debased, and borne down∣wards,
contrary to its natural Bent, by carnal and
terrene Objects; and that, on the other hand, it
was exalted, purged, and in some sort assimulated
to the Deity, by the Contemplation of Truth and
Practice of Virtue. Thus much in general they
saw or surmised. But then about the Way and
Means to know the one, or perform the other, they
were much at a loss. They were not agreed con∣cerning
the true End of Mankind; which, as they
saw, was mistaken in the vulgar Pursuits of Men;
so they found it much more eafy to consute the Er∣rors
of others, than to ascertain the Truth them∣selves.
Hence so many Divisions and Disputes
<PB N="217" REF="212"/>
about a Point which it most imported them to know,
insomuch as it was to give the Bias to human Life,
and govern the whole Tenor of their Actions and Conduct.</P>
<P>But when Life and Immortality were brought to
Light by the Gospel, there could remain no Dispute
about the chief End and Felicity of Man, no more
than there could about the Means of obtaining it,
after the express Declaration of our blessed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <HI>This is Life eternal, that
they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI> For the right Under∣standing
of which Words we must observe, that by
the Knowledge of God, is not meant a barren Spe∣culation,
either of Philosophers or Scholastic Di∣vines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Disputes and Dissensions among Men; but, on the
contrary, an holy practical Knowledge, which is
the Source, the Root, or Principle of Peace and
Union, of Faith, Hope, Charity, and universal Obe∣dience.
A Man may frame the most accurate No∣tions,
and in one Sense attain the exactest Know∣ledge
of God and Christ that human Faculties can
reach, and yet, notwithstanding all this, be far from
knowing them in that saving Sense. For St. <HI>John</HI>
tells us, that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John. iii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>whosoever sinneth, hath not seen Christ,
nor known him.</HI> And again,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE> <HI>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</HI> To know God as we ought, we
must love him; and love him so as withal to love
our Brethren, his Creatures and his Children. I
say, that Knowledge of God and Christ, which is
Life eternal, implies universal Charity, with all the
Duties ingrafted thereon, or ensuing from thence,
that is to say, the Love of God and Man. And
our Lord expresly saith,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 21.</NOTE> <HI>He that hath my Com∣mandments,
<PB N="218" REF="213"/>
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI>
From all which it is evident, that this saving Know∣ledge
of God is inseparable from the Knowledge
and Practice of his Will; the explicit Declaration
whereof, and of the Means to perform it, are con∣tained
in the Gospel, that divine Instrument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men. The Meta∣physical
Knowledge of God, considered in his ab∣solute
Nature or Essence, is one Thing, and to
know him as he stands related to us as Creator, Re∣deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The former
Kind of Knowledge (whatever it amounts to) hath
been, and may be, in Gentiles as well as Chris∣tians,
but not the latter, which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>From what has been said, it is a plain Conse∣quence,
that whoever is a sincere Christian cannot
be indifferent about bringing over other Men to
the Knowledge of God and Christ; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that Title, is
indispensably obliged in Duty to God, and in Cha∣rity
to his Neighbour, to desire and promote, so
far as there is Opportunity, the Conversion of Hea∣thens
and Infidels, that so they may become Par∣takers
of Life and Immortality. For, <HI>this is Life
eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou hast sent.</HI></P>
<P>In my present Discourse upon which Words; I
shall,</P>
<P>First, consider in general the Obligation that
Christians lie under, of bringing other Men to
the Knowledge of the only true God, and of
Jesus Christ. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, I shall consider it in reference to
this laudable Society, instituted for the Pro∣pagation
of the Gospel. And under each
Head; I propose to obviate such Difficulties
as may seem to retard, and intermix such Re∣marks
<PB N="219" REF="214"/>
as shall appear proper to forward so
good a Work.</P>
<P>Now although it be very evident, that we can
really have neither a just Zeal for the Glory of
God, nor a beneficent Love of Man, without wish∣ing
and endeavouring, as occasion serves, to spread
the glad Tidings of Salvation, and bring those who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to Life eter∣nal,
by the Knowledge of the only true God, and
of Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. Yet this
Duty, plain and undoubted as it seems, happens
to be too often overlooked, even by those whose
Attention to other Points would make one think
their Neglect of this, not an Effect of lukewarm
Indifference, so much as of certain mistaken Noti∣ons
and Suppositions. Two principal Considera∣tions
occur, which, in this particular, seem to have
slackened the Industry of some, otherwise zealous
and serious Christians.</P>
<P>One I apprehend to be this, that it is surmised,
the Christian Religion is in a declining State, which
by many Symptoms seems likely to end either in Po∣pery,
or a general Infidelity. And that of course
a prudent Person has nothing to do, but to make
sure of his own Salvation, and to acquiesce in the
general Tendency of Things, without being at any
fruitless Pains to oppose what cannot be prevented,
to steer against the Stream, or resist a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and Rapidity,
and in the End will be sure to overflow, and carry
before it. When a Man of a desponding and
foreboding Spirit hath been led, by his Observation
of the Ways of the World, and the prevailing Hu∣mour
of our Times, to think after this Manner; he
will be inclined to strengthen this his preconceived
Opinion, as is usual in other the like Cases, by Mis-application
of holy Scripture: For Instance, by
<PB N="220" REF="215"/>
those Words of our blessed Saviour,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xviii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>When
the Son of Man cometh, shall he find Faith on the
Earth?</HI> which have been applied to this very Pur∣pose,
as importing that before the final Judgment,
Christian Faith should be extinguished upon Earth;
although these Words do, from the Context, seem
plainly to refer to the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and
the obstinate Blindness of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who even then
when they felt the Hand of God, should not ac∣knowledge
it, or believe the <HI>Roman</HI> Army to be
the Instrument of divine Vengeance, in the Day of
their Visitation, by him whom they had injuriously
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</P>
<P>But, granting the former Sense might be sup∣ported
by no absurd Hypothesis, or no improbable
Guess; yet shall the Endeavours of Christian Men
for propagating the Gospel of Christ be forestalled
by any Suppositions or Conjectures whatsoever?
Admitting, I say, those Words regard the future
Advent of Jesus Christ, yet can any one tell how
near or how far off that Advent may be? Are
not the Times and Seasons foreknown only to God?
And shall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmise of what is to come hereafter?
This Way of thinking might furnish as strong
Reasons against Preaching at home, as abroad,
within, as without the Pale of the Church. It
would be as specious an Argument against the one as
the other, but in reality can conclude against neither.
For, as we know not when that supposed Time of
general Infidelity is to be, or whether it will be at
all; so, if it were ever so sure, and ever so near, it
would nevertheless become us to take care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particular Indif∣ference
and Neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="216"/>
But if we take our Notions, not from the uncer∣tain
Interpretation of a particular Text, but from
the whole Tenor of the divine Oracles, from the
express Promise and reiterated Predictions of our
blessed Lord and his Apostles, we shall believe,
that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>Jesus Christ is highly exalted of God, to the
End; that at his Name every Knee shall bow, and
every Tongue confess that he is the Lord, to the Glory
of God the Father.</HI> That<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 25.</NOTE> <HI>he must reign till he hath
put all Enemies under his Feet.</HI> That<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>he is with us
alway, even unto the End of the World.</HI> And that,
the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground
of Truth, is so far from being destroyed by human
Means,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi. 28.</NOTE> <HI>that the Gates of Hell</HI> (all the infernal
Powers) <HI>shall not prevail against it.</HI> Let us there∣fore
banish all such Conceits as may seem to justify
our Indolence, as may reason us out of all Courage
and Vigour in the Race that is set before us; let us
not, I say, slacken our own Hands, nor enfeeble
our own Knees, by preconceived Fancies and Sup∣positions,
considering that as the Success of all En∣terprises
in great measure depends on the Spirit of
the Undertakers, so nothing is more apt to raise a
Spirit than Hope; nor to depress it, than Despon∣dency.
We ought therefore to shake off every
vain Fear in our spiritual Warfare. The Number,
the Presumption, and the Abilities of those, who
take Counsel together against the Lord and against
his Anointed, should not dishearten, but rather ex∣cite
and encourage us to stand in the Gap.</P>
<P>Another Consideration, that may possibly with∣hold
divers sincere Believers from contributing their
Endeavours for bringing Men to the Knowledge of
God and Christ, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the present Age. Men natu∣rally
<PB N="222" REF="217"/>
cast about for Reasons to countenance the Part
they take. And as the Gift of Miracles was of
mighty Influence and Help to those, who were
commissioned to spread abroad the Light of the
Gospel in its first Promulgation, so no Pretence of∣fers
itself more naturally to excuse a Man from exe∣cuting
any Purpose, than the Want of Authority,
which, in the Opinion of Men, cannot be without
a just Commission, nor this unless distinguished
by those proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to this
Defect of Miracles, I shall beg leave to make two
Observations.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is to be observed, that if we have not
Miracles, we have other Advantages which make
them less necessary now, than in the first spreading
of the Gospel: Whole Nations have found the Be∣nefit
of Christ's Religion, it is protected by Princes,
established and encouraged by Laws, supported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by the Experience
of many Ages, as well as by the Authority and
Example of the wisest it and most knowing Men.
Certainly, if the greatest Part of Mankind are Gen∣tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied, that the
most knowing, most learned, and most improved
Nations, profess Christianity; and that even the
Mahometans themselves bear Testimony to the di∣vine
Mission of Jesus Christ. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wanderers, of
the meanest of the People, had the Prejudices, the
Learning, and the Power of their own, as well as
other Nations, in one World, the whole World, to
oppose and overcome: Those who at this Day
engage in the Propagation of the Gospel, do it up∣on
Terms in many Respects far more easy and ad∣vantageous.
It is Power against Weakness, Civili∣ty
against Barbarism, Knowledge against Ignorance,
<PB N="223" REF="218"/>
some or other, if not all these Advantages, in the
present Times, attending the Progress of the Chris∣tian
Religion, in whatever Part of the World Men
shall attempt to plant it.</P>
<P>In the second Place we may reflect, that if we
have not the Gift of Miracles, this is a good Rea∣son
why we should exert more strongly those human
Means which God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the Head, or the
Hand, or the Tongue, our Interest, our Credit, or our
Fortune, subservient to the great Giver of them;
and chearfully contribute our humble Mite towards
hastening that Time, wherein<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxvi. 9.</NOTE><HI>all Nations whom
thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O
Lord, and shall glorify thy Name.</HI> It is at least
a plain Case, that the Want of Apostolical Gifts
should not be pleaded as a Bar to our doing that,
which in no Respect, either of Difficulty or Danger,
equals, or approaches the Apostolical Office. What
Pretence can this supply for Mens being quite uncon∣cerned
about the Spreading of the Gospel, or the
Salvation of Souls? for Mens forgetting that they
are Christians, and related to human Kind? How
can this justify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not contributing
a small Part of their Fortune towards forwarding a
Design, wherein they share neither Pains nor Pe∣ril;
the not bestowing on it, even the cheap As∣sistance
of their Speech, Attention, Counsel, or
Countenance, as Occasion offers? How unlike is
this worldly, selfish Indifference, to that Account
which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of himself, that<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 33.</NOTE> <HI>he sought
not his own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they
may be saved.</HI> And yet herein he expected the <HI>Co∣rinthians</HI>
(and the same Reason will hold for us)
<PB N="224" REF="219"/>
should be like him; for he subjoins, <HI>Be ye Followers
of me as I also am of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Having considered the Duty in general, I come
now to treat of it with reference to <HI>America,</HI> the
peculiar Province of this venerable Society; which
I suppose well informed of the State and Progress
of Religion in that Part of the World, by their
Correspondencies with the Clergy upon their Mis∣sion.
It may nevertheless be expected that one who
had been engaged in a Design upon this very View,
who hath been upon the Place, and resided a consi∣derable
Time in one of our Colonies, sould have
observed somewhat worth reporting. It is to be
hoped, therefore, that one Part of my Audience will
pardon, what the other may perhaps expect, while
I detain them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have observed, and such Reflexions as thereupon
suggested themselves; some Part of which may pos∣sibly be found to extend to ether Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> with a Portion of the adjacent
Continent, under the same Government, is inha∣bited
by an <HI>English</HI> Colony, consisting chiefly
of Sectaries of many different Denominations, who seem
to have worn off part of that Prejudice, which they
inherited from their Ancestors, against the national
Church of this Land; though it must be acknow∣ledged
at the same Time, that too many of them
have worn off a serious Sense of all Religion. Se∣veral
indeed of the better Sort are accustomed to
assemble themselves regularly on the Lord's Day
for the Performance of divine Worship. But most
of those, who are dispersed throughout this Colony,
seem to rival some well-bred People of other Coun∣tries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is s∣acred,
being equally careless of outward Worship,
and of inward Principles, whether of Faith or
Practice. Of the Bulk of them it may certainly
<PB N="225" REF="220"/>
be said, that they live without the Sacraments, not
being so much as baptized: And as for their Morals,
I apprehend there is nothing to be found in them
that should tempt others to make an Experiment of
their Principles, either in Religion or Government.
But it must be owned; the general Behaviour of the
Inhabitants in those Towns where Churches and
Meetings have been long settled, and regularly at∣tended,
seems so much better, as sufficiently to shew
the Difference, which a solemn regular Worship of
God makes between Persons of the same Blood,
Temper, and natural Faculties.</P>
<P>The native <HI>Indians,</HI> who are said to have been
formerly many Thousands, within the Compass of
this Colony, do not at present amount to one
Thousand, including every Age and Sex. And
these are either all Servants or Labourers for the
<HI>English,</HI> who have contributed more to destroy
their Bodies by the Use of strong Liquors, than by
any means to improve their Minds, or save their
Souls. This slow Poison, jointly operating with
the Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much more
destructive than both) hath consumed the <HI>Indians,</HI>
not only in our Colonies, but also far and wide upon
our Consines. And having made Havock of them,
is now doing the same thing by those who taught
them that odious Vice.</P>
<P>The Negroes in the Government of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI>
are about half as many more than the <HI>Indians;</HI> and
both together scarce amount to a seventh Part of
the whole Colony. The Religion of these People,
as is natural to suppose, takes after that of their
Masters. Some few are baptized; several frequent
the different Assemblies; and far the greater Part
none at all. An ancient Antipathy to the <HI>Indians,</HI>
whom it seems, our first Planters (therein as in cer∣tain
other Particulars affecting to imitate <HI>Jews</HI> rather
<PB N="226" REF="221"/>
than <HI>Christians</HI>) imagined they had a Right to treat
on the Foot of <HI>Canaanites</HI> or <HI>Amalekites,</HI> together
with an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had no Right to
be instruced or admitted to the Sacraments, have
proved a main Obstacle to the Conversion of these
poor People.</P>
<P>To this may be added, an erroneous Notion,
that the being baptized, is inconsistent with a State
of Slavery. To undeceive them in this Particular,
which had too much Weight, it seemed a proper
Step, if the Opinion of his Majesty's Attorney and
Solicitor-General could be procured. This Opi∣nion
they charitably sent over, signed with their
own Hands; which was accordingly printed in
<HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> and dispersed throughout the Plan∣tations.
I heartily wish it may produce the intend∣ed
Effect. It must be owned, our reformed Planters,
with respect to the Natives and the Slaves, might
learn from those of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> how it is
their Interest and Duty to behave. Both <HI>French</HI>
and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have intermarried with <HI>Indians,</HI> to
the great Strength, Security and Increase of their
Colonies. They take care to instruct both them
and their Negroes, in the <HI>Popish</HI> Religion, to the
Reproach of those who profess a better. They
have also Bishops and Seminaries for Clergy; and
it is not found that their Colonies are worse Sub∣jects,
or depend less on their Mother Country, on
that Account.</P>
<P>It should seem, that the likeliest Step towards
converting the Heathen would be to begin with the
<HI>English</HI> Planters; whose Influence will for ever be
an Obstacle to propagating the Gospel, till they
have a right Sense of it themselves, which would
shew them how much it is their Duty to impart it
to others. The Missionaries employed by this
<PB N="227" REF="222"/>
venerable Society have done, and continue to do,
good Service, in bringing those Planters to a serious
Sense of Religion, which, it is hoped, will in Time
extend to others. I speak it knowingly, that the
Ministers of the Gospel, in those Provinces which
go by the Name of <HI>New-England,</HI> sent and sup∣ported
at the Expence of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of Manners, discreet Behaviour, and
a competent Degree of useful Knowledge, shewn
themselves worthy the Choice of those who sent
them; and particularly in living on a more friendly
Foot with their Brethren of the Separation; who,
on their Part, were also very much come off from
that Narrowness of Spirit, which formerly kept
them at such an unamicable Distance from us. And
as there is Reason to apprehend, that Part of <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>
could not have been thus distinguished, and
provided with such a Number of proper Persons,
if one half of them had not been supplied out of
the dissenting Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal Improve∣ments
of Learning, are observed to quit their Pre∣judice
towards an episcopal Church; so I verily
think it might increase the Number of such useful
Men, if Provision were made to defray their Charges
in coming hither to receive Holy Orders; passing
and repassing the Ocean, and tarrying the necessary
Time in <HI>London,</HI> requiring an Expence that many
are not able to bear. It would also be an Encou∣ragement
to the Missionaries in general, and pro∣bably
produce good Effects, if the Allowance of
certain Missionaries were augmented, in proportion
to the Services they had done, and the Time they
had spent in their Million. These Hints I venture
to suggest, as not unuseful in an Age, wherein all
human Encouragements are found more necessary,
than at the first Propagation of the Gospel. But
<PB N="228" REF="223"/>
they are, with all due Deference and Respect,
submitted to the Judgment of this venerable Au∣dience.</P>
<P>After all, it is hardly to be expected, that so
long as Infidelity prevails at home, the Christian
Religion should thrive and flourish in our Colonies
abroad. Mankind, it must be owned, left to them∣selves,
are so much bewildered and benighted, with
respect to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a loss about the Means
of being freed; that the Doctrines of the lapsed
State of Man, his Reconciliation by Christ, and
Regeneration by the Spirit, may reasonably be
hoped to find an easy Admission, as bringing with
them Light and Comfort, into a Mind not hardened
by Impenitency, nor fore-closed by Pride, nor bi∣ased
by Prejudice. But such is the Vanity of Man,
that no Prejudice operates more powerfully than
that in Favour of Fashion; and no Fashions are so
much followed by our Colonies, as those of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt in their
Modes of living, to their great Inconvenience,
without allowing for the Disparity of Circumstance
or Climate. This same Humour hath made Infi∣delity
(as I find it too credibly reported) spread in
some of our wealthy Plantations; uneducated Men
being more apt to tread in the Steps of Libertines
and Men of Fashion, than to model themselves by
the Laws and Institutions of their Mother Country,
or the Lives and Professions of the virtuous and
religious Part of it.</P>
<P>But this is not all: While those abroad are less
disposed to receive, some at home are, perhaps,
less disposed to propagate the Gospel, from the
same Cause. It is to be feared, I say, that the pre∣vailing
Torrent of Infidelity, which staggers the
Faith of some, may cool the Zeal and damp the

Spirit of others, who, judging from the Event and
Success of those who impugn the Church of Christ,
may possibly entertain some Scruple or Surmise,
whether it may not be, for the present at least,
abandoned by Providence, and that human Care
must ineffectually interpose, till it shall please God,
<HI>yet once more to shake not the Earth only, but also the
Heavens.</HI> This Point hath been touched before,
but deserves farther Consideration: to the End,
that the peculiar Impiety of a profane Age, may
not be a Bar to those very Endeavours, which itself
renders more necessary, and calls for more loudly
now than ever.</P>
<P>Whatever Men may think, the Arm of the Lord
is not shortened. In all this Prevalency of Atheism
and Irreligion, there is no Advantage gained by
the Powers of Darkness, either against God, or
godly Men, but only against their own wretched
Partisans. The Christian Dispensation is a Dis∣pensation
of Grace and Favour. The Christian
Church a Society of Men intitled to this Grace, on
performing certain Conditions. If this Society is
diminished, as those who remain true Members of it
suffer no Loss to themselves, so God loseth no
Right, suffereth no Detriment, forgoeth no Good;
his Grace resisted or unfruitful, being no more
lost to him, than the Light of the Sun shining
on desert Places, or among People who shut their
Eyes.</P>
<P>Besides, this Excess, this unstemmed Torrent of
Profaneness, may possibly, in the Conclusion, de∣feat
itself, confirm what it meant to extirpate, and
instead of destroying, prove a Means of preserving
our Religion; the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being so notorious and flagrant, and so sensibly felt,
as in all likelihood to be able to open the Eyes,
and rouse the Attention of those, who may be blind
<PB N="230" REF="225"/>
and deaf to every other Argument and Con∣sideration.
Or, who knows but the Christian
Church corrupted by Prosperity, is to be restored
and purified by Adversity? which may prove for
ought we can tell, as salutary in future, as it hath
been in past Ages. Many insolent and presumptu∣ous
Foes have set themselves against the Church of
God; whole Hook nevertheless may be in their
Nostrils, and his Bridle in their Lips, managing
and governing, even their Rage and Folly, to the
fulfilling of his own wise Purposes; and who may
not fail in the End, to deal by them as he did by
the King of <HI>Assyria,</HI> when he had<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. x. 12.</NOTE> <HI>performed his
Work upon</HI> Sion <HI>and upon</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>punishing their
stout Heart and high Looks.</HI> This presumptuous
Conqueror was, without knowing it, a Tool or In∣strument
in the Hands of that God whom he blas∣phemed.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. x. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>O</HI> Assyrian, <HI>the Rod of mine Anger! I
will send him against an hypocritical Nation, and
against the People of my Wrath will I give him a
Charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and
to tread them down like the Mire of the Streets.
Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his Heart
think so, but it is in his Heart to destroy and cut off
Nations not a few.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much at least is evident: It is no new
Thing, that great Enormities should produce great
Humiliations, and these again noble Virtues, which
have often recovered both single Men, and whole
States, even in a natural and civil Sense. And if
the Captivities, Distresses, and Desolations of the
Jewish Church, have occasioned their Return to
God, and reinstated them in his Favour; nay, if it
was actually foretold, whenever they lay under the
Curse of God, at the Mercy of their Enemies,
<PB N="202" REF="226"/>
peeled and scattered in a foreign Land, that never∣theless
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 3.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord their God would
turn their Captivity, and have Compassion upon them.</HI>
I say, if Things were so, why may we not in
Reason hope for something analogous thereto, in
behalf of the Christian Church, It cannot be de∣nied,
that there was a great Analogy between the
Jewish Institutions, and the Doctrines of the
Gospel; for Instance, between the Paschal Lamb,
and the Lamb of God slain from the Foundation
of the World; between the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, and
that of Sin; the earthly <HI>Canaan,</HI> and the heavenly;
the fleshly Circumcision, and the spiritual.
In these and many other Particulars, the Analogy seems so
plain, that it can hardly be disputed. To be con∣vinced
that the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Jewish
Oeconomy were Figures and Shadows of the Evan∣gelical,
we need only look into the Epistle to the
<HI>Hebrews.</HI> May we not therefore, in pursuance
of this same Analogy, suppose a similar Treatment
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Christian</HI> Church?</P>
<P>Let us then see, on what Terms the former
flood with God, in order to discover what the latter
may reasonably expect. The solemn Denunciation
to the <HI>Jews</HI> was,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut, xxviii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>If thou shall hearken diligently
unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and
to do all his Commandments, which I command thee
this Day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high
above all the Nations of the Earth.</HI> But in case of
Disobedience, it is added among many other
Threats and Maledictions:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ver. 22, 23.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord shall smite
thee with Blasting and with Mildew: and thy Heaven
that is over thy Head shall be Brass, and the Earth
that is under thee shall be Iron.</HI> And again,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ver. 28.</NOTE> <HI>The
<PB N="232" REF="227"/>
Lord shall smite thee with Madness, and Blindness,
and Astonishment of Heart.</HI> Have not the People of
this Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the just Judgments of Heaven? Surely
we have felt in a Metaphor the first of the fore∣mentioned
Judgments; and the last hath been
literally fulfilled upon us. Is it not visible that we
are less knowing, less virtuous, less reasonable, in
Proportion as we are less religious? Are we not
grown drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity and
Presumption, and Free-thinking, and Extravagance
of every Kind? to a Degree that we may truly be
said to be <HI>smitten with Madness, and Blindness, and
Astonishment of Heart.</HI></P>
<P>As anciently most unchristian Schisms and Dis∣putes,
joined with great Corruption of Manners,
made way for the <HI>Mahometan</HI> in the East, and the
Papal Dominion in the West; even so here at home
in the last Century, a weak Reliance upon human
Politics and Power on the one hand, and enthusi∣astic
Rage on the other, together with Carnal∣mindedness
on both, gave occasion to introduce
Atheism and Infidelity. If the temporal State,
and outward Form of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church was, upon
their Defection, overturned by Invaders; in like
manner, when Christians are no longer governed
by the Light of Evangelical Truth, when we resist
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<HI>the Heaven above will be as Brass,</HI> that the divine Grace
will no longer shower down on our obdurate Hearts,
that our Church and Profession will be blasted by
licentious Scorners, those Madmen, who in Sport
<HI>scatter Firebrands, Arrows, and Death?</HI> As all this
is no more than we may reasonably suppose will
ensue upon our Backsliding, so we may, with equal
Reason, hope it will be remedied upon our Return
to God.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="228"/>
From what hath been said it follows, that in
order to propagate the Gospel abroad, it is necessary
we do it at home, and extend our Charity to do∣mestic
Infidels, if we would convert or prevent
foreign ones. So that a View of the declining
State of Religion here at home, of those Things
that produced this Declension, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected with
the Subject of this Discourse. I shall therefore beg
your Patience, while I just mention a few Remarks
or Hints, too obvious, perhaps, in themselves
to be new or unknown to any present, but too little
visible in their Effects, to make one think they are,
by all, much attended to.</P>
<P>Some, preferring Points notional or ritual to the
Love of God and Man, consider the national
Church only as it stands opposed to other Christian
Societies. These generally have a Zeal without
Knowledge, and the Effects are suitable to the
Cause; they really hurt what they seem to espouse.
Others more solicitous about the Discovery of
Truth, than the Practice of Holiness, employ
themselves, rather to spy out Errors in the Church,
than enforce its Precepts. These, it is to be feared,
postpone the great Interests of Religion to Points
of less Concern, in any Eyes but their own. But
surely they would do well to consider, that an
humble, though confused or indistinct, Faith in the
Bond of Charity, and productive of good Works,
is much more Evangelical than any accurate disput∣ing
and conceited Knowledge.</P>
<P>A Church which contains the Fundamentals, and
nothing subversive of those Fundamentals, is not to
be set at naught by any particular Member; be∣cause
it may not, in every Point, perhaps, cor∣respond
with his Ideas, no not, though he is sure
of being in the right. Probably there never was,
<PB N="234" REF="229"/>
or will be, an established Church in this World,
without visible Marks of Humanity upon it. Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> supposeth, that<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>on the Foundation of Jesus
Christ, there will be human Superstructures of Hay
and Stubble,</HI> Things light and trivial, wrong or
superstitious, which indeed is a natural Consequence
of the Weakness and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid in the
Mind, there will not fail to grow and spring from
thence those Virtues and Graces, which are the ge∣nuine
Effects and Tokens of true Faith, and which
are by no means inconsistent with every Error in
Theory, or every needless Rite in Worship.</P>
<P>The Christian Religion was calculated for the
Bulk of Mankind, and therefore cannot reasonably
be supposed to consist in subtle and nice Notions.
From the Time that Divinity was considered as a
Science, and human Reason inthroned in the Sanc∣tuary
of God, the Hearts of its Professors seem to
have been less under the Influence of Grace. From
that Time have grown many unchristian Dissen∣sions
and Controversies, of Men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>knowing nothing,
but doting about Questions and Strifes of Words,
whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Sur∣mises,
perverse Disputings of Men of corrupt Minds
and destitute of Truth.</HI> Doubtless, the making Re∣ligion
a notional Thing, hath been of infinite Dis∣service.
And whereas its holy Mysteries are rather
to be received with Humility of Faith, than
de∣fined and measured by the Accuracy of human
Reason; all Attempts of this Kind, however well
intended, have visibly failed in the Event; and
instead of reconciling Infidels, have, by creating
Disputes and Heats among the Professors of Chris∣tianity,
given no small Advantage to its Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="230"/>
To conclude, if we proportioned our Zeal to the
Importance of Things: If we could love Men
whose Opinions we do not approve: If we knew
the World more, and liked it less: If we had a
due Sense of the divine Perfection and our own
Defects: If our chief Study was the Wisdom from
above, described by St. <HI>Paul:</HI> And if, in order
to all this, that were done in Places of Education,
which cannot so well be done out of them: I say,
if these Steps were taken at home, while proper
Measures are carrying on abroad, the one would
very much forward or facilitate the other. As it is
not meant, so it must not be understood, that
foreign Attempts should wait for domestic Success,
but only that it is to be wished they may co-operate.
Certainly if a just and rational, a genuine and sincere,
a warm and vigorous Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would soon reach
our foreign Plantations, and extend throughout
their Borders. We should soon see Religion shine
forth with new Lustre and Force, to the Conversion
of Infidels, both at home and abroad, and to
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 5.</NOTE> <HI>the casting down Imaginations, and every high
Thing that exalteth itself against the Knowledge of God, and
bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience
of Christ.</HI></P>
<CLOSER>To whom with the FATHER, and the HOLY
GHOST, be ascribed all Praise, Might, Ma∣jesty,
and Dominion, now and for ever.</CLOSER>

De motus principio &amp; natura, &amp; de causa
communicationis motuum.</HEAD>
<P>1. AD veritatem inveniendam praecipuum est
cavisse ne voces malè intellectae nobis offi∣ciant:
quod omnes fere monent philosophi, pauci
observant. Quanquam id quidem haud adeo diffi∣cile
videtur, in rebus praesertim Physicis tractandis,
ubi locum habent sensus, experientia, &amp; ratiocinium
geometricum. Seposito igitur, quantum licet, omni
praejudicio, tam à loquendi consuetudine, quam à
philosophorum auctoritate nato, ipsa rerum natura
diligenter inspicienda. Neque enim cujusquam
auctoritatem usque adeo valere oportet, ut verba
ejus &amp; voces in pretio sint, dummodo nihil clari &amp;
certi iis subesse comperiatur.</P>
<P>2. Motus contemplatio mirè torsit veterum phi∣losophorum
mentes, unde natae sunt variae opiniones
supra modum difficiles, ne dicam absurdae, quae
quum jam fere in desuetudinem abierint, haud me∣rentur
ut iis discutiendis nimio studio immoremur.
Apud recentiores autem &amp; saniores hujus aevi Phi∣losophos,
ubi de motu agitur, vocabula haud pauca
<PB N="240" REF="233"/>
abstractae nimium &amp; obscurae significationis oc∣currunt,
cujusmodi sunt <HI>solicitatio gravitatis, conatus,
vires mortuae,</HI> &amp;c. quae scriptis alioqui doctissimis
tenebras offundunt, sententiisque, non minus à vero
quam à sensu hominum communi abhorrentibus
ortum prae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent. Haec vero necesse est ut, veritatis
gratia, non alios refellendi studio, accuratè discu∣tiantur.</P>
<P>3. Solicitatio &amp; nisus sive conatus rebus solum∣modo
animatis revera competunt. Cum aliis rebus
tribuuntur, sensu metaphorico accipiantur necesse
est. A metaphoris autem abstinendum philosopho.
Porro seclusâ omni tam animae affectione quam
corporis motione, nihil clari ac distincti iis vocibus
significari cuilibet constabit, qui modò rem seriò
perpenderit.</P>
<P>4. Quamdiu corpora gravia à nobis sustinentur,
sentimus in nobismet ipsis nisum, fatigationem, &amp;
molestiam. Percipimus etiam in gravibus cadenti∣bus
motum acceleratum versus centrum telluris: ope
sensuum praeterea nihil. Ratione tamen colligitur
causam esse aliquam vel principium horum phaeno∣menôn,
illud autem <HI>gravitas</HI> vulgò nuncupatur.
Quoniam verò causa descensus gravium caeca sit &amp;
incognita: gravitas ea acceptione propriè dici nequit
qualitas sensibilis: est igitur qualitas occulta. Sed
vix, &amp; ne vix quidem, concipere licet quid sit
qualitas occulta, aut qua ratione qualitas ulla agere
aut operari quidquam possit. Melius itaque foret,
si, missa qualitate occulta, homines attenderent
solummodo ad effectus sensibiles, vocibusque ab∣stractis,
(quantumvis illae ad disserendum utiles sint)
in meditatione omissis, mens in particularibus &amp;
concretis, hoc est in ipsis rebus, defigeretur.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Vis</HI> similiter corporibus tribuitur; usurpatur
autem vocabulum illud, tanquam significaret qua∣litatem
cognitam, distinctamque tam à motu, figura,
<PB N="241" REF="234"/>
omnique alia re sensibili, quam ab omni animalis
affectione, id vero nihil aliud esse quàm qualitatem
occultam rem acriùs rimanti constabit. Nisus ani∣malis
&amp; motus corporeus vulgo spectantur tanquam
symptomata &amp; mensurae hujus qualitatis occultae.</P>
<P>6. Pater igitur gravitatem aut vim frustra poni
pro principio motus: nunquid enim principium
illud clarius cognosci potest ex eo quod dicatur qua∣litas
occulta? Quod ipsum occultum est nihil ex∣plicat.
Ut omittamus causam agentem incognitam
rectius dici posse substantiam quam qualitatem.
Porro, <HI>vis, gravitas,</HI> &amp; istiusmodi voces saepius,
nec ineptè, in concreto usurpantur, ita ut connotent
corpus motum, difficultatem resistendi, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ubi
vero à Philosophis adhibentur ad significandas
naturas quasdam ab hisce omnibus praecisas &amp; ab∣stractas,
quae nec sensibus subjiciuntur nec ulla
mentis vi intelligi nec imaginatione effingi possunt,
tum demùm errores &amp; confusionem pariunt.</P>
<P>7. Multos autem in errorem ducit, quod voces
generales &amp; abstractas in disserendo utiles esse vide∣ant,
nec tamen earum vim satis capiant. Partim
vero à consuetudine vulgari inventae sunt illae
ad sermonem abbreviandum, partim, à Philosophis ad
docendum excogitatae: non, quod ad naturas rerum
accommodatae sint, quae quidem singulares, &amp; con∣cretae
existunt, sed quod idoneae ad tradendas disci∣plinas,
propterea quod faciant notiones vel saltem
propositiones universales.</P>
<P>8. Vim corpoream esse aliquid conceptu facile
plerumque existimamus: ii tamen qui rem accura∣tiùs
inspexerunt in diversa sunt opinione, uti appa∣ret
ex mira verborum obscuritate qua laborant, ubi
illam explicare conantur. Toricellius ait vim &amp;
impetum esse res quasdam abstractas subtilesque,
&amp; quintessentias quae includuntur in substantia cor∣porea,
<PB N="242" REF="235"/>
tanquam in vase magico Circes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">La materia altro non e che un vaso di Circe incantato, il quale serve per ricettacolo della forza &amp; de momenti dell' impeto la forza &amp; l'imperi sono astratti tanto sottili, sono quintessenze tanto spiritose, che in altre ampolle non si possono racchiudere, fuor che nell' intima corpulenza de solidi naturali. Vid. Lezioni Academiche.</NOTE>. Leibnitius
item in natura vis explicanda haec habet. <HI>Vis activa,
primitiva, quae est <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, animae vel
formae substantiali respondet. vid. Acta erudit. Lips.</HI>
Usque adeo necesse est ut vel summi viri quamdiu
abstractionibus indulgent, voces nulla certa signi∣ficatione
praeditas &amp; meras scholasticorum umbras
sectentur. Alia ex neotericorum scriptis, nec pauca
quidem ea, producere liceret, quibus abunde con∣staret,
metaphysicas abstractiones non usquequaque
cessisse mechanicae &amp; experimentis, sed nogotium
inane philosophis etiamnum facessere.</P>
<P>9. Ex illo fonte derivantur varia absurda cujus
generis est illud, <HI>vim percussionis utcunque exiguae esse
infinitè magnam.</HI> Quod sane supponit, gravitatem
esse qualitatem quandam realem ab aliis omnibus
diversam: &amp; gravitationem esse quasi actum hujus
qualitatis à motu realiter distinctum; minima autem
percussio producit effectum majorem quam maxima
gravitatio sine motu. Illa scilicet motum aliquem
edit, haec nullum. Unde sequitur, vim percussionis
ratione infinita excedere vim gravitationis, hoc est
esse infinitè magnam. Videantur experimenta Galilaei
&amp; quae de definita vi percussionis scripserunt Torri∣cellius,
Borellus &amp; alii.</P>
<P>10. Veruntamen fatendum est vim nullam per
se immediate sentiri, neque aliter quam per effec∣tum
cognosci &amp; mensurari; sed vis mortuae seu
gravitationis simplicis, in corpore quiescente sub∣jecto
nulla facta mutatione, effectus nullus est. Per∣cussionis
autem, effectus aliquis. Quoniam ergo
<PB N="243" REF="236"/>
vires sunt effectibus proportionales: concludere licet
vim mortuam esse nullam: neque tamen propterea
vim percussionis esse infinitam: non enim oportet
quantitatem ullam positivam habere pro infinita,
propterea quod ratione infinita superet quantitatem
nullam sive nihil.</P>
<P>11. Vis gravitationis à momento secerni nequit,
momentum autem sine celeritate nullum est, quum
sit moles in celeritatem ducta, porro celeritas sine
motu intelligi non potest, ergo nec vis gravitationis.
Deinde, vis nulla nisi per actionem innotescit &amp; per
eandem mensuratur, actionem autem corporis à
motu praescindere non possumus, ergo, quamdiu
corpus grave plumbi subjecti vel chordae figuram
mutat, tamdiu movetur: ubi vero quiescit, nihil
agit, vel, quod idem est, agere prohibetur. Bre∣viter,
voces istae <HI>vis mortua</HI> &amp; <HI>gravitatio,</HI> etsi per
abstractionem metaphysicam aliquid significare sup∣ponuntur
diversum à movente, moto, motu &amp;
quiete, revera tamen id totum nihil est.</P>
<P>12. Siquis diceret pondus appensum vel imposi∣tum
agere in chordam, quoniam impedit quominus
se restituat vi elastica: dico, pari ratione corpus
quodvis inferum agere in superius incumbens, quo∣niam
illud descendere prohibet: dici vero non potest
actio corporis, quod prohibeat aliud corpus existere
in eo loco quem occupat.</P>
<P>13. Pressionem corporis gravitantis quandoque
sentimus. Verum sensio ista molesta oritur ex
motu corporis istius gravis fibris nervisque nostri
corporis communicato, &amp; eorundem situm immu∣tante,
adeoque percussioni accepta referri debet.
In hisce rebus multis &amp; gravibus praejudiciis labo∣ramus,
sed illa acri atque iteratâ meditatione subi∣genda
sunt, vel potius penitùs averruncanda.</P>
<P>14. Quo probetur, quantitatem ullam esse infi∣nitam,
ostendi oportet partem aliquam finitam ho∣mogeneam
<PB N="244" REF="237"/>
in eâ infinities contineri. Sed vis mortua
se habet ad vim percussionis non ut pars ad totum,
sed ur punctum ad lineam, juxta ipsos vis infinitae
percussionis auctores. Multa in hanc rem adjicere
liceret sed vereor ne prolixus sim.</P>
<P>15. Ex principiis praemissis lites insignes solvi
possunt, quae viros doctos multum exercuerunt.
Hujus rei exempium sit controversia illa de propor∣tione
virium. Una pars dum concedit, momenta,
motus, impetus, data mole, esse simpliciter ut
volocitates, affirmat vires esse ut quadrata volocita∣tum.
Hanc autem sententiam supponere, vim
corporis distingui à momento, motu, &amp; impetu,
eaque suppositione sublata corruere, nemo non
videt.</P>
<P>16. Quo clarius adhuc appareat, confusionem
quandam miram per abstractiones metaphysicas in
doctrinam de motu introductam esse, videamus
quantum intersit inter notiones virorum celebrium
de vi &amp; impetu. Leibnitius impetum cum motu
confundit. Juxta Newtonum impetus revera idem
est cum vi inertiae. Borellus asserit impetum non
aliud esse quam gradum velocitatis. Alii impetum
&amp; conatum inter se differre, alii non differre vo∣lunt.
Plerique vim motricem motui proporti∣onalem
intelligunt, nonnulli aliam aliquam vim
praeter motricem, &amp; diversimodè mensurandam,
utpote per quadrata velocitatum in moles, in∣telligere
prae se ferunt. Sed infinitum esset haec
prosequi.</P>
<P>17. <HI>Vis, gravitas, attractio,</HI> &amp; hujusmodi voces
utiles sunt ad ratiocinia, &amp; computationes de motu
&amp; corporibus motis: sed non ad intelligendam
simplicem ipsius motus naturam, vel ad qualitates
totidem distinctas designandas. Attractionem cer∣te
quod attinet, patet illam ab Newtono adhiberi,
non tanquam qualitatem veram &amp; physicam, sed
<PB N="245" REF="238"/>
solummodo ut hypothesin mathematicam. Quin
&amp; Leibnitius, nisum elementarem seu solicitationem
ab impetu distinguens, fatetur illa entia non re ipsa
inveniri in rerum natura, sed abstractione facienda
esse.</P>
<P>18. Similis ratio est compositionis &amp; resolutio∣nes
virium quarumcunque directarum in quascunque
obliquas, per diagonalem &amp; latera parallelogram∣mi.
Haec mechanicae &amp; computationi inserviunt:
sed aliud est computationi &amp; demonstrationibus
mathematicis inservire, aliud, rerum naturam ex∣hibere.</P>
<P>19. Ex recentioribus multi sunt in eâ opinione,
ut putent motum neque destrui nec de novo gigni,
sed eandem semper motus quantitatem permanere.
Aristoteles etiam dubium illud olim proposuit,
utrum motus factus sit &amp; corruptus, an vero ab
aeterno? phys. l. 8. Quod vero motus sensibilis
pereat, patet sensibus, illi autem eundem impetum,
nisum, aut summam virium eandem manere velle
videntur. Unde affirmat Borellus, vim in percus∣sione,
non imminui sed expandi, impetus etiam
contrarios suscipi &amp; retineri in eodem corpore.
Item Leibnitius nisum ubique &amp; semper esse in ma∣teria,
&amp;, ubi non patet sensibus, ratione intelligi
contendit. Haec autem nimis abstracta esse &amp; ob∣scura,
ejusdemque ferè generis cum formis substan∣tialibus
&amp; Entelechiis, fatendum.</P>
<P>20. Quotquot ad explicandam motus causam
atque originem vel principio Hylarchico, vel natu∣rae
indigentiâ, vel appetitu, aut denique instinctu
naturali utuntur, dixisse aliquid potius quam cogi∣tâsse
censendi sunt. Neque ab hisce multùm ab∣sunt

aut etiam spiritus iis implantatos ad instar formae,</HI> ut

assignent causam accelerationis gravium cadentium.
Aut qui dixerit<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leibnitius.</NOTE> <HI>in corpore praeter solidam extensionem
debere etiam poni aliquid unde virium consideratio oria∣tur.</HI>
Siquidem hi omnes vel nihil particulare &amp;
determinatum enuntiant: vel, si quid sit, tam diffi∣cile
erit illud explicare, quam id ipsum cujus ex∣plicandi
causâ adducitur.</P>
<P>21. Frustra ad naturam illustrandam adhibentur
ea quae nec sensibus patent, nec ratione intelligi
possunt. Videndum ergo quid sensus, quid experi∣entia,
quid demùm ratio iis innixa suadeat. Duo
sunt summa rerum genera, corpus &amp; anima. Rem
extensam, solidam, mobilem, figuratam, aliisque
qualitatibus quae sensibus occurrunt praeditam, ope
sensuum, rem vero sentientem, percipientem, in∣telligentem,
conscientiâ quâdam internâ cognovi∣mus.
Porro, res istas planè inter se diversas esse,
longèque heterogeneas, cernimus. Loquor autem
de rebus cognitis, de incognitis enim differere nil

<P>22. Totum id quod novimus, cui nomen <HI>corpus</HI> in∣didimus,
nihil in se continet quod motus principium

contrario non modo illas verum etiam alias, quot∣quot
sint, corporis qualitates sigillatim percurrentes,
videbimus omnes esse revera passivas, nihilque iis
activum inesse, quod ullo modo intelligi possit
tanquam fons &amp; principium motus. Gravitatem
quod attinet, voce illa nihil cognitum &amp; ab ipso
effectu sensibili, cujus causa quaeritur, diversum signi∣ficari
jam ante ostendimus. Et sanè quando cor∣pus
grave dicimus nihil aliud intelligimus, nisi quod
<PB N="247" REF="240"/>
feratur deorsum, de causâ hujus effectus sensibilis
nihil omnino cogitantes.</P>
<P>23. De corpore itaque audacter pronunciare li∣cet,
utpote de re comperta, quod non sit princi∣pium
motûs. Quod si quisquam, praeter solidam
extensionem ejusque modificationes, vocem <HI>corpus</HI>
qualitatem etiam occultam, virtutem, formam,
essentiam complecti sua significatione contendat;
licet quidem illi inutili negotio sine ideis disputare,
&amp; nominibus nihil distinctè exprimentibus abuti.
Caeterùm sanior philosophandi ratio videtur ab no∣tionibus
abstractis &amp; generalibus (si modo notiones
dici debent quae intelligi nequeunt) quantum fieri
potest abstinuisse.</P>
<P>24. Quicquid continetur in idea corporis novi∣mus:
quod vero novimus in corpore id non esse
principium motûs constat. Qui praeterea aliquid
incognitum in corpore, cujus ideam nullam habent,
comminiscuntur, quod motûs principium dicant:
ii revera nihil aliud quam principium motus esse in∣cognitum
dicunt. Sed hujusmodi subtilitatibus
diutiùs immorari piget.</P>
<P>25. Praeter res corporeas alterum est genus re∣rum
cogitantium, in iis autem potentiam inesse
corpora movendi, propria experientia didicimus,
quandoquidem anima nostra pro lubitu possit ciere
&amp; sistere membrorum motus, quacunque tandem
ratione id fiat. Hoc certè constat, corpora moveri
ad nutum animae, eamque proinde haud ineptè
dici posse principium motus; particulare quidem
&amp; subordinatum, quodque ipsum dependeat à primo
&amp; universali principio.</P>
<P>26. Corpora gravia feruntur deorsum, etsi nullo
impulsu apparente agitata, non tamen existiman∣dum
propterea in iis contineri principium motus:
cujus rei hanc rationem assignat Aristoteles, <HI>gravia
&amp; levia,</HI> inquit, <HI>non moventur à seipsis, id enim
<PB N="248" REF="241"/>
vitale esset, &amp; se sistere possent.</HI> Gravia omnia unâ
eâdemque certâ &amp; constanti lege centrum telluris
petunt, neque in ipsis animadvertitur principium
vel facultas ulla motum istum sistendi, minuendi
vel, nisi pro rata proportione, augendi, aut deni∣que
ullo modo immutandi: habent adeò se passivè.
Porro idem, strictè &amp; accuratè loquendo, dicendum
de corporibus percussivis. Corpora ista quamdiu
moventur, ut &amp; in ipso percussionis momento, se
gerunt passivè, perinde scilicet atque cum quiescunt.
Corpus iners tam agit quam corpus motum, si res
ad verum exigatur: id quod agnoscit Newtonus,
ubi ait, vim inertiae esse eandem cum impetu.
Corpus autem iners &amp; quietum nihil agit, ergo nec
motum.</P>
<P>27. Revera corpus aequè perseverat in utrovis
statu, vel motûs vel quietis. Ista vero perseveran∣tia
non magis dicenda est actio corporis, quam
existentia ejusdem actio diceretur. Perseverantia
nihil aliud est quam continuatio in eodem modo
existendi, quae propriè dici actio non potest.
Caeterùm resistentiam, quam experimur in sistendo
corpore moto, ejus actionem esse fingimus vana
specie delusi. Revera enim ista resistentia quam
sentimus, passio est in nobis, neque arguit corpus
agere, sed nos pati: constat utique nos idem pas∣suros
fuisse, sive corpus illud à se moveatur, sive ab
alio principio impellatur.</P>
<P>28. Actio &amp; reactio dicuntur esse in corporibus:
nee incommodè ad demonstrationes mechanicas.
Sed cavendum, ne propterea supponamus virtutem
aliquam realem quae motûs causa, sive principium
sit, esse in iis. Etenim voces illae eodem modo
intelligendae sunt ac vox <HI>attractio,</HI> &amp; quemadmo∣dum
haec est hypothesis solummodo mathematica
non autem qualitas physica; idem etiam de illis
intelligi debet, &amp; ob eandem rationem. Nam si∣cut
<PB N="249" REF="242"/>
veritas &amp; usus theorematum de mutua corpo∣rum
attractione in philosophia mechanica stabiles
manent, utpote unicè fundati in motu corporum,
sive motus iste causari supponatur per actionem
corporum se mutuo attrahentium, sive per actionem
agentis alicujus à corporibus diversi impellentis
&amp; moderantis corpora; pari ratione, quaecunque
tradita sunt de regulis &amp; legibus motuum, simul ac
theoremata inde deducta, manent inconcussa, dum∣modo
concedantur effectus sensibiles, &amp; ratiocinia
iis innixa; sive supponamus actionem ipsam, aut
vim horum effectuum causatricem, esse in corpore,
sive in agente incorporeo.</P>
<P>29. Auferantur ex idea corporis extensio, soli∣ditas,
figura, remanebit nihil. Sed qualitates istae
sunt ad motum indifferentes, nec in se quidquam
habent, quod motus principium dici possit. Hoc
ex ipsis ideis nostris perspicuum est. Si igitur voce
<HI>corpus</HI> significatur, id quod concipimus: planè
constat inde non peti posse principium motus: pars
scilicet nulla aut attributum illius causa efficiens vera
est, quae motum producat. Vocem autem proferre,
&amp; nihil concipere, id demùm indignum esset phi∣losopho.</P>
<P>30. Datur res cogitans activa quam principium
motûs esse in nobis experimur. Hanc <HI>animam,
mentem, spiritum</HI> dicimus; datur etiam res extensa,
iners, impenetrabilis, mobilis, quae à priori toto
coelo differt, novumque genus constituit. Quan∣tum
intersit inter res cogitantes &amp; extensas, pri∣mus
omnium deprehendens Anaxagoras vir longè
sapientissimus, asserebat mentem nihil habere cum
corporibus commune, id quod constat ex primo
libro Aristotelis de anima. Ex neotericis idem
optimè animadvertit Cartesius. Ab eo alii rem
satis claram vocibus obscuris impeditam ac difficilem
reddiderunt.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="243"/>
31. Ex dictis manifestum est eos qui vim activam,
actionem, motus principium, in corporibus revera
inesse affirmant, sententiam nulla experientia fun∣datam
amplecti, eamque terminis obscuris &amp; ge∣neralibus
adstruere, nec quid sibi velint satis intel∣ligere.
E contrario, qui mentem esse principium
motus volunt, sententiam propria experientia mu∣nitam
proferent, hominumque omni aevo doctissi∣morum
suffragiis comprobatam.</P>
<P>32. Primus Anaxagoras <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> introduxit, qui
motum inerti materiae imprimeret, quam quidem
sententiam probat etiam Aristoteles pluribusque
confirmat, apertè pronuncians primum movens
esse immobile, indivisibile, &amp; nullam habens
magnitudinem. Dicere autem, omne motivum
esse mobile, rectè animadvertit idem esse ac siquis
diceret, omne aedificativum esse aedificabile, physic.
l. 8. Plato insuper in Timaeo tradit machinam
hanc corpoream, seu mundum visibilem agitari &amp;
animari à mente, quae sensum omnem fugiat.
Quinetiam hodie philosophi Cartesiani principium
motuum naturalium Deum agnoscunt. Et New∣tonus
passim nec obscurè innuit, non solummodo
motum ab initio à numine profectum esse, verum
adhuc systema mundanum ab eodem actu moveri.
Hoc sacris literis consonum est: hoc scholasticorum
calculo comprobatur. Nam etsi peripatetici na∣turam
tradant esse principium motûs &amp; quietis,
interpretantur tamen naturam naturantem esse
Deum. Intelligunt nimirum corpora omnia sys∣tematis
hujusce mundani à mente praepotenti, juxta
certam &amp; constantem rationem moveri.</P>
<P>33. Caeterùm qui principium vitale corporibus
tribuunt, obscurum aliquid &amp; rebus parùm con∣veniens
fingunt. Quid enim aliud est vitali principio
praeditum esse quam vivere? aut vivere quam se
movere, sistere, &amp; statum suum mutare? Philoso∣phi
<PB N="251" REF="244"/>
autem hujus saeculi doctissimi, pro principio in∣dubitato
ponunt, omne corpus perseverare in statu
suo, vel quietis vel motûs uniformis in directum,
nisi quatenus aliunde cogitur statum illum mutare;
è contrario, in anima sentimus esse facultatem tam
statum suum quam aliarum rerum mutandi; id
quod propriè dicitur vitale, animamque à corpori∣bus
longe discriminat.</P>
<P>34. Motum &amp; quietem in corporibus recertiores
considerant velut duos status existendi, in quorum
utrovis corpus omne sua natura iners permaneret,
nulla vi externa urgente. Unde colligere licet,
eandem esse causam motûs &amp; quietis, quae est exis∣tentiae
corporum. Neque enim quaerenda videtur alia
causa existentiae corporis successivae in diversis parti∣bus
spatii, quam illa unde derivatur existentia ejus∣dem
corporis successiva in diversis partibus temporis.
De Deo autem optimo maximo rerum omnium
conditore &amp; conservatore tractare: &amp; qua ratione
res cunctae à summo &amp; vero ente pendeant de∣monstrare,
quamvis pars sit scientiae humanae
praecellentissima, spectat tamen potius ad philoso∣phiam
primam seu metaphysicam &amp; theologiam,
quam ad philosophiam naturalem, quae hodie fere
omnis continetur in experimentis &amp; mechanicâ.
Itaque cognitionem de Deo vel supponit philosophia
naturalis, vel mutuatur ab aliqua scientia superiori.
Quanquam verissimum sit, naturae investigationem
scientiis altioribus argumenta egregia ad sapientiam,
bonitatem &amp; potentiam Dei illustrandam &amp; pro∣bandam
undequaque subministrare.</P>
<P>35. Quod haec minus intelligantur, in causa est,
cur nonnulli immerito repudient physicae principia
mathematica, eo scilicet nomine quod illa causas
rerum efficientes non assignant. Quum tamen re∣vera
ad physicam aut mechanicam spectet regulas
solummodo, non causas efficientes, impulsionum
<PB N="252" REF="245"/>
attractionumve &amp;, ut verbo dicam, motuum leges
tradere: ex iis vero positis phaenomenôn particu∣larium
solutionem, non autem, causam efficientem
assignare.</P>
<P>36. Multum intererit considerasse quid propriè
sit principium, &amp; quo sensu intelligenda sit vox illa
apud philosophos. Causa quidem vera efficiens,
&amp; conservatrix rerum omnium jure optimo appel∣latur
fons &amp; principium earundem. Principia vero
philosophiae experimentalis propriè dicenda sunt
fundamenta, quibus illa innititur, seu fontes unde
derivatur, (non dico existentia, sed) cognitio rerum
corporearum, sensus utique &amp; experientia. Si∣militer,
in philosophia mechanica, principia di∣cenda
sunt, in quibus fundatur &amp; continetur uni∣versa
disciplina, leges illae motuum primariae, quae
experimentis comprobatae, ratiocinio etiam excultae
sunt &amp; redditae universales. Hae motuum leges
commodè dicuntur principia, quoniam ab iis tam
theoremata mechanica generalia quam particulares
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> explicationes derivantur.</P>
<P>37. Tum nimirum dici potest quidpiam expli∣cari
mechanicè, cum reducitur ad ista principia
simplicissima &amp; universalissima, &amp; per accuratum
ratiocinium, cum iis consentaneum &amp; connexum
esse ostenditur. Nam, inventis semel naturae legi∣bus,
deinceps monstrandum est philosopho, ex
constanti harum legum observatione, hoc est, ex
iis principiis phaenomena quodvis necessario con∣sequi:
id quod est phaenomena explicate &amp; solvere,
causamque, id est rationem cur fiant, assignare.</P>
<P>38. Mens humana gaudet scientiam suam ex∣tendere
&amp; dilatare. Ad hoc autem notiones &amp;
propositiones generales efformandae sunt, in qui∣bus
quodam modo continentur propositiones &amp;
cognitiones particulares, quae tum demùm intelligi
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reduntur. Hoc geometris notissimum est. In
<PB N="253" REF="246"/>
mechanica etiam praemittuntur notiones, hoc est
definitiones, et enunciationes de motu primae &amp;
generales, ex quibus postmodùm methodo mathe∣matica
conclusiones magis remotae, &amp; minus ge∣nerales
colliguntur. Et sicut per applicationem
theorematum geometricorum, corporum particu∣larium
magnitudines mensurantur; ita etiam per
applicationem theorematum mechanices universa∣lium,
systematis mundani partium quarumvis mo∣tus,
&amp; phaenomena inde pendentia innotescunt &amp;
determinantur: ad quem scopum unicè collinean∣dum
physico.</P>
<P>39. Et quemadmodum geometrae disciplinae
causa, multa comminiscuntur, quae nec ipsi descri∣bere
possunt, nec in rerum natura invenire: si∣mili
prorsus ratione mechanicus voces quasdam
abstractas &amp; generales adhibet, fingitque in cor∣poribus
vim, actionem, attractionem, solicitatio∣nem,
&amp;c. quae ad theorias &amp; enunciationes, ut &amp;
computationes de motu apprime utiles sunt, etiamsi
in ipsâ rerum veritate &amp; corporibus actu existenti∣bus
frustra quaererentur, non minus quàm quae à
geometris per abstractionem mathematicam fin∣guntur.</P>
<P>40. Revera, ope sensuum nihil nisi effectus seu
qualitates sensibiles, &amp; res corporeas omnino passi∣vas,
sive in motu sint sive in quiete, percipimus:
ratioque &amp; experientia activum nihil praeter men∣tem
aut animam esse suadet. Quid quid ultra fin∣gitur,
id ejusdem generis esse cum aliis hypothesi∣bus
&amp; abstractionibus mathematicis existimandum;
quod penitus animo infigere oporter. Hoc ni fiat,
facilè in obscuram scholasticorum subtilitatem, quae
per tot saecula, tanquam dira quaedam pestis, phi∣losophiam
corrupit, relabi possumus.</P>
<P>41. Principia mechanica legesque motuum aut
naturae universales, saeculo ultimo feliciter inven∣tae,
<PB N="254" REF="247"/>
&amp; subsidio geometriae tractatae &amp; applicatae,
miram lucem in philosophiam intulerunt. Prin∣cipia
vero metaphysica causaeque reales efficientes
motus &amp; existentiae corporum attributorumve cor∣poreorum
nullo modo ad mechanicam aut experi∣menta
pertinent, neque eis lucem dare possunt,
nisi quatenus, velut praecognita inserviant ad li∣mites
physicae praefiniendos, eaque ratione ad tol∣lendas
difficultates quaestionesque peregrinas.</P>
<P>42. Qui à spiritibus motus principium petunt,
ii vel rem corpoream vel incorpoream voce <HI>spiri∣lus</HI>
intelligunt: si rem corpoream, quantumvis
tenuem, tamen redit difficultas: si incorpoream,
quantumvis id verum sit, attamen ad physicam non
propriè pertinet. Quod si quis philosophiam na∣turalem
ultra limites experimentorum &amp; mecha∣nicae
extenderit, ita ut rerum etiam incorporearum,
&amp; inextensarum cognitionem complectatur: latior
quidem illa vocis acceptio tractationem de anima,
mente, seu principio vitali admittit. Caeterùm
commodius erit, juxta usum jam ferè receptum,
ita distinguere inter scientias, ut singulae propriis
circumscribantur cancellis, &amp; philosophus natura∣lis
totus sit in experimentis, legibusque motuum,
&amp; principiis mechanicis, indeque depromptis ra∣tiociniis;
quidquid autem de aliis rebus protulerit
id superiori alicui scientiae acceptum referat. Ete∣nim
ex cognitis naturae legibus pulcherrimae theo∣riae,
praxes etiam mechanicae ad vitam utiles con∣sequuntur.
Ex cognitione autem ipsius naturae
auctoris considerationes, longe praestantissimae qui∣dem
illae, sed, metaphysicae, theologiae, morales
oriuntur.</P>
<P>43. De principiis hactenus: nunc dicendum de
natura motus, atque is quidem, cum sensibus
clare percipiatur non tam natura sua, quam doctis
philosophorum commentis obscuratus est. Motus
<PB N="255" REF="248"/>
nunquam in sensus nostros incurrit sine mole cor∣porea,
spatio, &amp; tempore. Sunt tamen qui mo∣tum,
tanquam ideam quandam simplicem &amp; ab∣stractam,
atque ab omnibus aliis rebus sejunctam,
contemplari student. Verùm idea illa tenuissima
&amp; subtilissima intellectûs aciem eludit: id quod
quilibet secum meditando experiri potest. Hinc
nascuntur magnae difficultates de natura motus, &amp;
definitiones, ipsa re quam illustrare debent, longe
obscuriores. Hujusmodi sunt definitiones illae
Aristotelis &amp; Scholasticorum, qui motum dicunt
esse actum <HI>mobilis, quatenus est mobile, vel actum en∣tis
in potentia quatenus in potentia.</HI> Hujusmodi etiam
est illud, viri inter recentiores celebris, qui asserit
<HI>nihil in motu esse reale praeter momentaneum illud quod
in vi ad mutationem nitente constitui debet.</HI> Porro,
constat, horum &amp; similium definitionum auctores in
animo habuisse abstractam motus naturam, seclusa
omni temporis &amp; spatii consideratione, explicare,
sed qua ratione abstracta illa motus quintessentia (ut
ita dicam) intelligi possit non video.</P>
<P>44. Neque hoc contenti, ulterius pergunt par∣tesque
ipsius motus à se invicem dividunt &amp; secer∣nunt,
quarum ideas distinctas, tanquam entium
revera distinctorum, efformare conantur. Etenim
sunt qui motionem à motu distinguant, illam velut
instantaneum motus elementum spectantes. Ve∣locitatem
insuper, conatum, vim, impetum toti∣dem
res essentia diversas esse volunt, quarum quae∣que
per propriam atque ab aliis omnibus segrega∣tam
&amp; abstractam ideam intellectui objiciatur. Sed
in hisce rebus discutiendis, stantibus iis quae supra
disseruimus, non est cur diutius immoremur.</P>
<P>45. Multi etiam per <HI>transitum</HI> motu desiniunt,
obliti scilicet transitum ipsum sine motu intelligi
non posse, &amp; per motum definiri oportere. Ve∣rissimum
adeo est definitiones, sicut nonnullis re∣bus
<PB N="256" REF="249"/>
lucem, ita vicissim aliis tenebras afferre. Et
profecto, quascumque res sensu percipimus, eas
clariores aut notiores definiendo efficere vix quis∣quam
potuerit. Cujus rei vana spe allecti res fa∣ciles
difficillimas reddiderunt philosophi, mentesque
suas difficultatibus, quas ut plurmum ipsi peperis∣sent, implicavere. Ex hocce definiendi, simulac
abstrahendi studio, maltae, tam de motu, quam
de aliis rebus natae subtilissimae quaestiones, eaedem∣que
nullius utilitatis, hominum ingenia frustra tor∣serunt,
adeo ut Aristoteles ultro &amp; saepius fateatur
motum esse <HI>actum quendam cognitu difficilem,</HI> &amp; non∣nulli
ex veteribus usque eo nugis exercitati devenie∣bant,
ut motum omnino esse negarent.</P>
<P>46. Sed hujusmodi minutiis distineri piget. Satis
sit fontes solutionum indicasse: ad quos etiam illud
adjungere libet: quod ea quae de infinita divisione
temporis &amp; spatii in mathesi traduntur, ob con∣genitam
rerum naturam paradoxa &amp; theorias spinosas
(quales sunt illae omnes in quibus agitur de infinito)
in speculationes de motu intulerunt. Quidquid
autem hujus generis sit, id omne motus commune
habet cum spatio &amp; tempore, vel potius ad ea refert
acceptum.</P>
<P>47. Et quemadmodum, ex una parte nimia ab∣stractio
seu divisio rerum verè inseparabilium, ita,
ab altera parte, compositio seu potius confusio
rerum diversissimarum motus naturam perplexam
reddidit. Usitatum enim est motum cum causa
motus efficiente confundere. Unde accidit ut
motus sit quasi biformis, unam faciem sensibus ob∣viam,
alteram caliginosa nocte obvolutam habens.
Inde obscuritas &amp; confusio, &amp; varia de motu para∣doxa
originem trahunt, dum effectui perperam
tribuitur id quod revera causae solummodo com∣petit.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="250"/>
48. Hinc oritur opinio illa, eandem semper mo∣tus
quantitatem conservari; quod, nisi intelligatur
de vi &amp; potentia causae, sive causa illa dicatur na∣tura,
sive <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, vel quodcunque tandem agens sit,
falsum esse cuivis facile constabit. Aristoteles qui∣dem
l 8. physicorum, ubi quaerit <HI>utrum motus
factus sit &amp; corruptus, an vero ab aeterno tanquam
vita immortalis insit rebus omnibus,</HI> vitale principium
po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius, quam effectum externum, sive mutationem
loci intellexisse videtur.</P>
<P>49. Hinc etiam est, quod multi suspicantur mo∣tum
non esse meram passionem in corporibus,
Quod si intelligamus id quod, in motu corporis,
sensibus objicitur, quin omnino passivum sit nemo
dubitare potest. Ecquid enim in se habet succes∣siva
corporis existentia in diversis locis, quod ac∣tionem
referat, aut aliud sit quam nudus &amp; iners
effectus?</P>
<P>50. Peripatetici, qui dicunt motum esse actum
unum utriusque, moventis &amp; moti, non satis dis∣criminant
causam ab effectu. Similiter, qui ni∣sum
aut conatum in motu fingunt, aut idem cor∣pus
simul in contrarias partes ferri putant, eâdem
idearum confusione, eâdem vocum ambiguitate
ludificari videntur.</P>
<P>51. Juvat multum, sicut in aliis omnibus, ita in
scientia de motu accuratam diligentiam adhibere,
tam ad aliorum conceptus intelligendos quam ad
suos enunciandos: in qua re nisi peccatum esset,
vix credo in disputationem trahi potuisse, utrùm
corpus indifferens sit ad motum &amp; ad quietem
necne. Quoniam enim experientia constat, esse
legem naturae primariam, ut corpus perinde per∣severet
in <HI>statu motus ac quietis, quamdiu aliunde
nihil accidat ad statum istum mutandum.</HI> Et propterea
vim inertiae sub diverso respectu esse vel resisten∣tiam,
vel impetum, colligitur. Hoc sensu, pro∣fecto
<PB N="258" REF="251"/>
corpus dici potest sua natura indifferens ad
motum vel quietem. Nimirum, tam difficile est
quietem in corpus motum, quam motum in qui∣escens
inducere; cum vero corpus pariter conservet
statum utrumvis, quid ni dicatur ad utrumvis se
habere indifferenter?</P>
<P>52. Peripatetici pro varietate mutationum, quas
res aliqua tubire potest, varia motus genera distin∣guebant.
Hodie de motu agentes intelligunt so∣lummodo
motum localem. Motus autem localis
intelligi nequit nisi simul intelligatur quid sit <HI>locus;</HI>
is vero à neotericis definitur <HI>pars spatii quam corpus
occupat,</HI> unde dividitur in relativum &amp; absolutum
pro ratione spatii. Distinguunt enim inter spa∣tium
absolutum sive verum, ac relativum sive ap∣parens.
Volunt scilicet dari spatium undequaque
immensum, immobile, insensibile, corpora uni∣versa
permeans &amp; continens, quod vocant spatium
absolutum. Spatium, autem, à corporibus com∣prehensum,
vel definitum, sensibusque adeo sub∣jectum,
dicitur spatium relativum, apparens, vul∣gare.</P>
<P>53. Fingamus itaque corpora cuncta destrui &amp;
in nihilum redigi. Quod reliquum est vocant spa∣tium
absolutum, omni relatione quae à situ &amp; dis∣tantiis
corporum oriebatur, simul cum ipsis corpo∣ribus,
sublatâ. Porro spatium illud est infinitum,
immobile, indivisible, insensibile, sine relatione
&amp; sine distinctione. Hoc est, omnia ejus attribu∣ta
sunt privativa vel negativa: videtur igitur esse
merum nihil. Parit solummodo difficultatem ali∣quam
quod extensum sit. Extensio autem est
qualitas positiva. Verùm qualis tandem extensio
est illa, quae nec dividi potest, nec mensurari,
cujus nullam partem, nec sensu percipere, nec
imaginatione depingere possumus? Etenim nihil
in imaginationem cadit, quod, ex natura rei, non
<PB N="259" REF="252"/>
possibile est ut sensu percipiatur, siquidem imagi∣natio
nihil aliud est quam facultas representatrix
rerum sensibilium, vel actu existentium, vel saltem
possibilium. Fugit insuper intellectum purum,
quum facultas illa versetur tantum circa res spiri∣tuales
&amp; inextensas, cujusmodi sunt mentes nostrae,
earumque habitus, passiones, virtutes &amp; similia.
Ex spatio igitur absoluto, auferamus modò voca∣bula,
&amp; nihil remanebit in sensu, imaginatione aut
intellectu; nihil aliud ergo iis designatur, quam
pura privatio aut negatio, hoc est, merum nihil.</P>
<P>54. Confitendum omnino est nos circa hanc
rem gravissimis praejudiciis teneri, à quibus ut li∣beremur,
omnis animi vis exerenda. Etenim
multi, tantum abest quod spatium absolutum pro
nihilo ducant ut rem esse ex omnibus (Deo ex∣cepto)
unicam existiment, quae annihilari non pos∣sit:
statuantque illud suapte natura necessariò ex∣istere,
aeternumque esse &amp; increatum, atque adeo
attributorum divinorum particeps. Verum enim∣vero
quum certissimum sit, res omnes, quas no∣minibus
designamus, per qualitates aut relationes,
vel aliqua saltem ex parte, cognosci, (ineptum
enim foret vocabulis uti quibus cogniti nihil, ni∣hil
notionis, ideae vel conceptus subjiceretur.)
Inquiramus diligenter, utrum formare liceat ideam
ullam spatii illius puri, realis, absoluti, post om∣nium
corporum annihilationem perseverantis ex∣istere.
Ideam porro talem paulo acrius intuens,
reperio ideam esse nihili purissimam, si modo idea
appellanda sit. Hoc ipse summa adhibita diligen∣tia
expertus sum: hoc alios pari adhibita diligentia
experturos reor.</P>
<P>55. Decipere nos nonnunquam solet, quod aliis
omnibus corporibus imaginatione sublatis, nostrum
tamen manere supponimus. Quo supposito, mo∣tum
membrorum ab omni parte liberrimum imagi∣namur.
<PB N="260" REF="253"/>

credimus tertium aliquod, spatium, videlicet, im∣mensum

Quam absentiam, sive privationem cor∣porum,
nihil esse positivum fateamur necesse est.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide quae contra spatium absolutum disseruntur in libro de principiis cognitionis humanae, idiomate anglicano, decem a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinc annis edito.</NOTE></P>
<P>56. Caeterum hasce res nisi quis libero &amp; acri
examine perspexerit, verba &amp; voces parum valent.
Meditanti vero, &amp; rationes secum reputanti, ni
fallor, manifestum erit, quaecunque de spatio puro
&amp; absoluto praedicantur, ea omnia de nihilo praedi∣cari
posse. Qua ratione mens humana facillimè
liberatur à magnis difficultatibus, simulque ab ea
absurditate tribuendi existentiam necessariam ulli rei
praeterquam soli Deo optimo maximo.</P>
<P>57. In proclivi esset sententiam nostram argu∣mentis
à posteriori (ut loquuntur) ductis confirmare,
quaestiones de spatio absoluto proponendo, exempli
gratia, utrum sit substantia vel accidens? Utrum
creatum vel increatum? &amp; absurditates ex utravis
parte consequentes demonstrando. Sed brevitati
consulendum. Illud tamen omitti non debet, quod
sententiam hancce Democritus olim calculo suo com∣probavit,
uti auctor est Aristoteles l. 1. phys. ubi
haec habet; <HI>Democritus solidum &amp; inane ponit prin∣cipia,
quarum aliud quidem ut quod est, aliud ut quod
non est esse dicit.</HI> Scrupulum si forte injiciat, quod
distinctio illa inter spatium absolutum &amp; relativum
<PB N="261" REF="254"/>
à magni nominis philosophis usurpetur, eique quasi
fundamento inaedificentur multa praeclara theore∣mata,
scrupulum istum vanum esse, ex iis, quae
secutura sunt, apparebit.</P>
<P>58 Ex praemissis patet, non convenire, ut de∣finiamus
locum verum corporis, esse partem spatii
absoluti quam occupat corpus, motumque verum
seu absolutum esse mutationem loci veri &amp; absoluti.
Siquidem omnis locus est relativus, ut et omnis motus.
Veruntamen ut hoc clarius appareat, animadver∣tendum
est, motum nullum intelligi posse sine de∣terminatione
aliqua seu directione, quae quidem in∣telligi
nequit, nisi praeter corpus motum, nostrum
etiam corpus, aut aliud aliquod, simul intelligatur
existere. Nam sursum, deorsum, sinistrorsum,
dextrorsum omnesque plagae &amp; regiones in relatione
aliqua fundantur, &amp;, necessario, corpus à moto
diversum connotant &amp; supponunt. Adeo ut, si
reliquis corporibus in nihilum redactis, globus,
exempli gratia, unicus existere supponatur; in illo
motus nullus concipi possit; usque adeo necesse est,
ut detur aliud corpus, cujus situ motus determinari
intelligatur. Hujus sententiae veritas clarissime elu∣cebit,
modo corporum omnium tam nostri quam
aliorum praeter, globum istum unicum, annihila∣tionem
recte supposuerimus.</P>
<P>59. Concipiantur porro <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> globi, &amp; praeterea
nil corporeum, existere. Concipiantur deinde
vires quomodocunque applicari, quicquid tandem
per applicationem virium intelligamus, motus cir∣cularis
duorum globorum circa commune cen∣trum
nequit per imaginationem concipi. Suppo∣namus
deinde coelum fixarum creari: subito ex
concepto appullu globorum ad diversas coeli istius
partes motus concipietur. Scilicet cum motus
natura sua sit relativus, concipi non potuit prius∣quam
darentur corpora correlata. Quemadmo∣dum
<PB N="262" REF="255"/>
nec ulla alia relatio sine correlatis concipi
potest.</P>
<P>60. Ad motum circularem quod attinet, putant
multi, crescente motu vero circulari, corpus ne∣cessario
magis semper magisque ab axe niti. Hoc
antem ex eo provenit, quod, cum motus circu∣laris
spectari possit tanquam in omni momento à
duabus directionibus ortum trahens, una secun∣dum
radium, altera secundum tangentem; si in
hac ultima tantùm directione impetus augeatur,
tum à centro recedet corpus motum, orbita vero
desinet esse circularis. Quod si aequaliter augean∣tur
vires in utraque directione, manebit motus
circularis, sed acceleratus conatu, qui non magis
arguet vires recedendi ab axe, quam accedendi ad
eundem, auctas esse. Dicendum igitur, aquam
in situla circumactam ascendere ad latera vasis,
propterea quod, applicatis novis viribus in di∣rectione
tangentis ad quamvis particulam aquae, eo∣dem
instanti non applicentur novae vires aequales
centripetae. Ex quo experimento nullo modo se∣quitur,
motum absolutum circularem per vires re∣cedendi
ab axe motus necessariò dignosci. Porrò,
qua ratione intelligendae sunt voces istae, <HI>vires cor∣porum
&amp; conatus,</HI> ex praemissis satis superque inno∣tescit.</P>
<P>61. Quo modo curva considerari potest tanquam
constans ex rectis infinitis, etiamsi revera ex illis
non constet, sed quòd ea hypothesis ad geome∣triam
utilis sit, eodem motus circularis spectari po∣test,
tanquam à directionibus rectilineis infinitis
ortum ducens, quae suppositio utilis est in philoso∣phia
mechanica. Non tamen ideo affirmandum,
impossibile esie, ut centrum gravitatis corporis cu∣jusvis
successive existat in singulis punctis periphe∣riae
circularis, nulla ratione habita directionis ullius
rectilineae, sive in tangente, sive in radio.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="256"/>
62. Haud omittendum est, motum lapidis in
fundâ, aut aquae in situlâ circumactâ dici non posse
motum vere circularem, juxta mentem eorum qui
per partes spatii absoluti definiunt loca vera corpo∣rum;
cum sit mirè compositus ex motibus non so∣lum
situlae vel fundae, sed etiam telluris diurno cir∣ca
proprium axem, menstruo circa commune cen∣trum
gravitatis terrae &amp; lunae, &amp; annuo circa solem.
Et propterea, particula quaevis lapidis vel aquae de∣scribat
lineam à circulari longe abhorrentem. Ne∣que
revera est, qui creditur, conatus axifugus,
quoniam non respicit unum aliquem axem ratione
spatii absoluti, supposito quod detur tale spatium:
proinde non video quomodo appellari possit cona∣tus
unicus, cui motus vere circularis tanquam pro∣prio
&amp; adaequato effectui respondet.</P>
<P>63. Motus nullus dignosci potest, aut mensurari,
nisi per res sensibiles. Cum ergo spatium absolutum
nullo modo in sensus incurrat, necesse est ut inutile
prorlus sit ad distinctionem motuum. Praeterea,
determinatio sive directio motui essentialis est, ilia
vero in relatione consistit. Ergo impossibile est ut
motus absolutus concipiatur.</P>
<P>64. Poriò, quoniam pro diversitate loci relativi,
varius sit motus ejusdem corporis, quinimò, uno
respectu moveri, altero quiescere dici quidpiam
possit: ad determinandum motum verum &amp; quie∣tem
veram, quo scilicet tollatur ambiguitas, &amp;
consulatur mechanicae philosophorum, qui systema
rerum latius contemplantur, satis fuerit spatium
relativum fixarum coelo, tanquam quiescente specta∣to,
conclusum adhibere, loco spatii absoluti. Mo∣tus
autem &amp; quies tali spatio relativo definiti, com∣modè
adhiberi possunt loco absolutorum, qui ab il∣lis
nullo symptomate discerni possunt. Etenim
imprimantur utcunque vires: sint quicunque cona∣tus:
concedamus motum distingui per actiones in
<PB N="264" REF="257"/>
corpora exercitas; nunquam tamen inde sequetur,
dari spatium illud, &amp; locum absolutum, ejusque
mutationem esse locum verum.</P>
<P>65. Leges motuum, effectusque, &amp; theoremata
eorundem proportiones &amp; calculos continentia, pro
diversis viarum figuris, accelerationibus itidem &amp;
directionibus diversis, mediisque plus minusve re∣sistentibus,
haec omnia constant sine calculatione
motus absoluti. Uti vel ex eo patet quod, quum
secundum illorum principia qui motum absolutum
inducunt, nullo symptomate scire liceat, utrum
integra rerum compages quiescat, an moveatur
uniformiter in directum, perspicuum sit motum ab∣solutum
nullius corporis cognosci psse.</P>
<P>66. Ex dictis patet ad veram motus naturam
perspiciendam summopere juvaturum: 1<SUP>o</SUP>. Distin∣guere
inter hypotheses mathematicas &amp; naturas
rerum. 2<SUP>o</SUP>. Cavere ab abstractionibus. 3<SUP>o</SUP>. Con∣fiderare
motum tanquam aliquid sensible, vel sal∣tem
imaginabile: mensurisque relativis esse con∣tentos.
Quae si fecerimus, simul clarissima quae∣que
philosophiae mechanicae theoremata, quibus
referantur naturae recessus, mundique systema cal∣culis
humanis subjicitur, manebunt intemerata:
et motus contemplatio à mille minutiis, subtilitatibus,
ideisque abstractis libera evadet. Atque haec de
natura motûs dicta sufficiant.</P>
<P>67. Restat, ut disseramus de causa communica∣tionis
motuum. Esse autem vim impressam in
corpus mobile, causam motus in eo plerique existi∣mant.
Veruntamen, illos non assignare causam
motus cognitam, &amp; à corpore motuque distinctam,
ex praemissis constat. Patet insuper vim non esse
rem certam &amp; determinatam, ex eo quod viri sum∣mi
de illa multùm diversa, immo contraria, profe∣rant,
salva tamen in consequentiis veritate. Si∣quidem
Newtonus ait vim impressam consistere in
<PB N="265" REF="258"/>
actione sola, esseque actionem exercitam in corpus
ad statum ejus mutandum, nec post actionem ma∣nere.
Torricellius cumulum quendam sive aggre∣gatum
virium impressarum per percussionem in
corpus mobile recipi, ibidemque manere atque im∣petum
constituere contendit. Idem fere Borellus
aliique praedicant. At vero, tametsi inter se pug∣nare
videantur Newtonus &amp; Torricellius, nihilo∣minus,
quum dum singuli sibi consentanea profe∣runt,
res satis commodè ab utrisque explicatur.
Quippe vires omnes corporibus attributae, tam sunt
hypotheses mathematicae quam vires atrtactivae in
planetis &amp; sole. Caeterùm entia mathematica in
rerum natura stabilem essentiam non habent: pen∣dent
autem à notione definientis: unde eadem res
diversimodè explicari potest.</P>
<P>68. Statuamus motum novum in corpore per∣cusso
conservari, sive per vim insitam, qua corpus
quodlibet perseverat in statu suo, vel motus, vel
quietis uniformis in directum: sive per vim im∣pressam,
durante percussione in corpus percussum
receptam ibidemque permanentem, idem erit quoad
rem, differentia existente in nominibus tantùm.
Similiter, ubi mobile percutiens perdit, &amp; percus∣sum
acquirit motum, parum refert disputate, utrum
motus acquisitus sit idem numero cum motu per∣dito,
ducit enim in minutias metaphysicas, &amp;
prorsus nominales de identitate. Itaque sive di∣camus
motum transire à percutiente in percussum,
sive in percusso motum de novo generari, destrui
autem in percutiente, res eodem recidit. Utro∣bique
intelligitur unum corpus motum perdere, al∣terum
acquirere, &amp; praeterea nihil.</P>
<P>69. Mentem, quae agitat &amp; continet universam
hancce molem corpoream, estque causa vera effi∣ciens
motus, eandem esse, propriè &amp; strictè lo∣quendo,
causam communicationis ejusdem haud
<PB N="266" REF="259"/>
negaverim. In philosophiâ tamen physicâ, causas
&amp; solutiones phaenomenôn à principiis mechanicis
petere oportet. Physicè igitur res explicatur non
assignando ejus causam verè agentem &amp; incorpo∣ream,
sed demonstrando ejus connexionem cum
principiis mechanicis: cujusmodi est illud, <HI>actio∣nem
&amp; reactionem esse semper contrarias &amp; aequales,</HI> à
quo, tanquam fonte &amp; principio primario, eruuntur
regulae de motuum communicatione, quae à neo∣tericis,
magno scientiarum bono, jam ante repertae
sunt &amp; demonstratae.</P>
<P>70. Nobis satis fuerit, si innuamus principium
illud alio modo declarari potuisse. Nam si vera
rerum natura, potius quam abstracta mathesis spec∣tetur,
videbitur rectius dici, in attractione vel
percussione passionem corporum, quam actionem,
esse utrobique aequalem. Exempli gratia, lapis
fune equo alligatus tantum trahitur versus equum,
quantum equus versus lapidem: corpus etiam mo∣tum
in aliud quiescens impactum, patitur eandem
mutationem cum corpore quiescente. Et quoad
effectum realem, percutiens est item percussum,
percussumque percutiens. Mutatio autem illa est
utrobique, tam in corpore equi quam in lapide,
tam in moto quam in quiescente, passio mera.
Esse autem vim, virtutem, aut actionem corpoream
talium effectuum verè &amp; propriè causatricem non
constat. Corpus motum in quiescens impingitur,
loquimur tamen activè, dicentes illud hoc impel∣lere:
nec absurdè in mechanicis, ubi ideae mathe∣maticae
potius quam verae rerum naturae spectantur.</P>
<P>71. In physica, sensus &amp; experientia, quae ad
effectus apparentes solummodo pertingunt, locum
habent; in mechanica, notiones abstractae mathe∣maticorum
admittuntur. In philosophia prima seu
metaphysica agitur de rebus incorporeis, de causis,
veritate, &amp; existentia rerum. Physicus series sive
<PB N="267" REF="260"/>
successiones rerum sensibilium contemplatur, qui∣bus
legibus connectuntur, &amp; quo ordine, quid
praecedit tanquam causa, quid sequitur tanquam
effectus animadvertens. Atque hac ratione dici∣mus
corpus motum esse causam motûs in altero,
vel ei motum imprimere, trahere etiam, aut im∣pellere.
Quo sensu causae secundae corporeae in∣telligi
debent, nullâ ratione habità verae sedis virium,
vel potentiarum actricum, aut causae realis cui insunt.
Porro, dici possunt causae vel principia mechanica,
ultra corpus, figuram, motum, etiam axiomata
scientiae mechanicae primaria, tanquam causae
con∣sequentium spectata.</P>
<P>72. Causae verè activae meditatione tantum, &amp;
ratiocinio è tenebris erui quibus involvuntur pos∣sunt,
&amp; aliquatenus cognosci. Spectat autem ad
philosophiam primam, seu metaphysicam, de iis
agere. Quod si cuique scientiae provincia sua tri∣buatur,
limites assignentur, principia &amp; objecta ac∣curatè
distinguantur, quae ad singulas pertinent,
tractare licuerit majore, cum facilitate, tum per∣spicuitate.</P>
