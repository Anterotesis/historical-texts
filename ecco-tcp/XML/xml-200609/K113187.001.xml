<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age advanced to the highest degree of refinement, that species of curiosity commences, which is busied in contemplating the progress of social life, in displaying the gradations of science, and in tracing the transitions from barbarism to civility.</P>
<P>That these speculations should become the fa∣vourite pursuits, and the fashionable topics, of such a period, is extremely natural. We look back on the savage condition of our ancestors with the triumph of superiority; we are pleased to mark the steps by which we have been raised from rudeness to elegance: and our reflections on this subject are accom∣panied with a conscious pride, arising in great measure from a tacit comparison of the infinite disproportion between the feeble efforts of remote ages, and our present improvements in knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
In the mean time, the manners, monuments, customs, practices, and opinions of antiquity, by forming so strong a contrast with those of our own times, and by exhibiting human nature and human inventions in new lights, in in unexpected appearances, and in various forms, are objects which forcibly strike a feeling imagination.</P>
<P>Nor does this spectacle afford nothing more than a fruitless gratification to the fancy. It teaches us to set a just estimation on our own acquisitions; and encourages us to cherish that cultivation, which is so closely connected with the existence and the exercise of every social virtue.</P>
<P>On these principles, to develop the dawnings of genius, and to pursue the progress of our national poetry, from a rude origin and obscure beginnings, to its perfection in a polished age, must prove an interesting and instructive investigation. But a his∣tory of poetry, for another reason, yet on the same principles, must be more especially productive of en∣tertainment and utility. I mean, as it is an art, whose object is human society: as it has the peculiar merit, in its operations on that object, of faithfully re∣cording the features of the times, and of preserving
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
the most picturesque and expressive repre∣sentations of manners: and, because the first mo∣numents of composition in every nation are those of the poet, as it possesses the additional advantage of transmitting to posterity genuine delineations of life in its simplest stages. Let me add, that anec∣dotes of the rudiments of a favourite art will always be particularly pleasing. The more early speci∣mens of poetry must ever amuse, in proportion to the pleasure which we receive from its finished productions.</P>
<P>Much however depends on the execution of such a design, and my readers are to decide in what degree I have done justice to so specious and promising a disquisition. Yet a few more words will not be perhaps improper, in vindication, or rather in explanation, of the manner in which my work has been conducted. I am sure I do not mean, nor can I pretend, to apologise for its defects.</P>
<P>I have chose to exhibit the history of our poetry in a chronological series: not distributing my mat∣ter into detached articles, of periodical divisions, or of general heads. Yet I have not always adhered so scrupulously to the regularity of annals, but that I
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
have often deviated into incidental digressions; and have sometimes stopped in the course of my career, for the sake of recapitulation, for the purpose of collecting scattered notices into a single and uniform point of view, for the more exact inspection of a topic which required a separate consideration, or for a comparative survey of the poetry of other nations.</P>
<P>A few years ago, Mr. MASON, with that liberality which ever accompanies true genius, gave me an authentic copy of Mr. POPE'S scheme of a History of English Poetry, in which our poets were classed under their supposed respective schools. The late lamented Mr. GRAY had also projected a work of this kind, and translated some Runic odes for its illustration, now published: but soon relinquishing the prosecution of a design, which would have de∣tained him from his own noble inventions, he most obligingly condescended to favour me with the sub∣stance of his plan, which I found to be that of Mr. POPE, considerably enlarged, extended, and improved.</P>
<P>It is vanity in me to have mentioned these com∣munications. But I am apprehensive my vanity will justly be thought much greater, when it shall appear, that in giving the history of English poetry,
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
I have rejected the ideas of men who are its most distinguished ornaments. To confess the real truth, upon examination and experiment, I soon discovered their mode of treating my subject, plausible as it is, and brilliant in theory, to be attended with difficul∣ties and inconveniencies, and productive of embarass∣ment both to the reader and the writer. Like other ingenious systems, it sacrificed much useful intelli∣gence to the observance of arrangement; and in the place of that satisfaction which results from a clearness and a fulness of information, seemed only to substi∣tute the merit of disposition, and the praise of contri∣vance. The constraint imposed by a mechanical atten∣tion to this distribution, appeared to me to destroy that free exertion of research with which such a history ought to be executed, and not easily recon∣cileable with that complication, variety, and extent of materials, which it ought to comprehend.</P>
<P>The method I have pursued, on one account at least, seems preferable to all others. My performance, in its present form, exhibits without transposition the gradual improvements of our poetry, at the same time that it uniformly represents the progression of our language.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
Some perhaps will be of opinion, that these annals ought to have commenced with a view of the Saxon poetry. But besides that a legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate subject would have almost doubled my labour, that the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries, that our Saxon poems are for the most part little more than religious rhapsodies, and that scarce any compositions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan state, every reader that reflects but for a mo∣ment on our political establishment must perceive, that the Saxon poetry has no connection with the nature and purpose of my present undertaking. Be∣fore the Norman accession, which succeeded to the Saxon government, we were an unformed and an unsettled race. That mighty revolution obliterated almost all relation to the former inhabitants of this island; and produced that signal change in our policy, constitution, and public manners, the effects of which have reached modern times. The begin∣ning of these annals seems therefore to be most properly dated from that era, when our national character began to dawn.</P>
<P>It was recommended to me, by a person eminent in the republic of letters, totally to exclude from
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
these volumes any mention of the English drama. I am very sensible that a just history of our Stage is alone sufficient to form an entire and extensive work; and this argument, which is by no means pre∣cluded by the attempt here offered to the public, still remains separately to be discussed, at large, and in form. But as it was professedly my intention to comprise every species of English Poetry, this, among the rest, of course claimed a place in these annals, and necessarily fell into my general design. At the same time, as in this situation it could only become a subordinate object, it was impossible I should examine it with that critical preci∣sion and particularity, which so large, so curious, and so important an article of our poetical literature demands and deserves. To have considered it in its full extent, would have produced the unwieldy excrescence of a disproportionate episode: not to have considered it at all, had been an omission, which must detract from the integrity of my intended plan. I flatter myself however, that from evidences hitherto unexplored, I have recovered hints which may facilitate the labours of those, who shall here∣after be inclined to investigate the antient state of dramatic exhibition in this country, with due com∣prehension and accuracy.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
It will probably be remarked, that the citations in the first volume are numerous, and sometimes very prolix. But it should be remembered, that most of these are extracted from antient manuscript poems never before printed, and hitherto but little known. Nor was it easy to illustrate the darker and more distant periods of our poetry, without producing ample specimens. In the mean time, I hope to merit the thanks of the antiquarian, for enriching the stock of our early literature by these new accessions: and I trust I shall gratify the reader of taste, in having so fre∣quently rescued from oblivion the rude inventions and irregular beauties of the heroic tale, or the romantic legend.</P>
<P>The design of the DISSERTATIONS is to prepare the reader, by considering apart, in a connected and comprehensive detail, some material points of a ge∣neral and preliminary nature, and which could not either with equal propriety or convenience be intro∣duced, at least not so formally discussed, in the body of the book; to establish certain fundamental princi∣ples to which frequent appeals might occasionally be made, and to clear the way for various observations arising in the course of my future enquiries.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE ORIGIN OF ROMANTIC FICTION in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">DISSERTATION I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT peculiar and arbitrary species of Fiction which we commonly call Romantic, was entirely unknown to the writers of Greece and Rome. It appears to have been imported into Europe by a people, whose modes of thinking, and habits of invention, are not natural to that country. It is generally supposed to have been borrowed from the Arabians. But this origin has not been hitherto perhaps examined or ascertained with a sufficient degree of accuracy. It is my present design, by a more distinct and extended inquiry than has yet been applied to the subject, to trace the manner and the period of its introduction into the popular belief, the oral poetry, and the literature, of the Europeans.</P>
<P>It is an established maxim of modern criticism, that the fictions of Arabian imagination were communicated to the
<PB REF="16"/>
western world by means of the crusades. Undoubtedly those expeditions greatly contributed to propagate this mode of fabling in Europe. But it is evident, although a circum∣stance which certainly makes no material difference as to the principles here established, that these fancies were intro∣duced at a much earlier period. The Saracens, or Arabians, having been for some time seated on the northern coasts of Africa, entered Spain about the beginning of the eighth cen∣tury <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See ALMAKIN, edit. Pocock. p. 72.</NOTE>. Of this country they soon effected a complete con∣quest: and imposing their religion, language, and customs, upon the inhabitants, erected a royal seat in the capital city of Cordoua.</P>
<P>That by means of this establishment they first revived the sciences of Greece in Europe, will be proved at large in another place <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the second Dissertation.</NOTE>: and it is obvious to conclude, that at the same time they disseminated those extravagant inventions which were so peculiar to their romantic and creative genius. A manuscript cited by Du Cange acquaints us, that the Spaniards, soon after the irruption of the Saracens, entirely neglected the study of the Latin language; and captivated with the novelty of the oriental books imported by these strangers, suddenly adopted an unusual pomp of style, and an affected elevation of diction <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Arabico eloquio <HI>sublimati,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> <BIBL>Du Cang. Gloss. Med. Inf. Latinitat. tom. i. Praef. p. xxvii. §. 31.</BIBL></NOTE>. The ideal tales of these eastern invaders, recommended by a brilliancy of descrip∣tion, a variety of imagery, and an exuberance of invention, hitherto unknown and unfamiliar to the cold and barren conceptions of a western climate, were eagerly caught up, and universally diffused. From Spain, by the communica∣tions of a constant commercial intercourse through the ports of Toulon and Marseilles, they soon passed into France and Italy.</P>
<P><PB REF="17" MS="y"/>
In France, no province, or district, seems to have given these fictions of the Arabians a more welcome or a more early reception, than the inhabitants of Armorica or Basse Bretagne, now Britany; for no part of France can boast so great a number of antient romances <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The reason on which this conclusion is founded will appear hereafter.</NOTE>. Many poems of high antiquity, composed by the Armorican bards, still re∣main <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><P>In the British Museum is a set of old French tales of chivalry in verse, writ∣ten, as it seems, by the bards of Bretagne.

<P>This description of a chamber painted with Venus and the three mysteries of nature, and the allusion to Ovid, prove the tales before us to be of no very high antiquity. But they are undoubtedly taken from others much older, of the same country. At the end of ELIDUC'S tale we have these lines. f. 181.</P>

Not succeeding in his designs, he was obliged to retire with his British troops to the continent, as in the text.

The Armoric language now spoken in Britany is a dialect of the Welsh: and so strong a resemblance still subsists between the two languages, that in our late conquest of Belleisle, such of our soldiers as were natives of Wales were understood by the peasantry. Milton, whose imagination was much struck with the old British story, more than once alludes to the Welsh colony planted in Armorica by Maximus and the prince of Meiriadoc.

<P>This migration of the Welsh into Britany or Armorica, which during the distractions of the empire, in consequence of the numerous armies of barbarians with which Rome was surrounded on every side, had thrown off its dependence on the Romans, seems to have occasioned a close connection between the two countries for many centuries <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This secession of the Welsh, at so cri∣tical a period, was extremely natural, into a neighbouring maritime country, with which they had constantly trafficked, and which, like themselves, had disclaimed the Roman yoke. It is not related in any Greek or Roman historian. But their silence is by no means a sufficient warrant for us to re∣ject the numerous testimonies of the old British writers concerning this event. It is mentioned, in particular, by Llywarchen, a famous bard, who lived only one hundred and fifty years afterwards. Many of his poems are still extant, in which he cele∣brates his twenty-four sons who wore gold chains, and were all killed in battles against the Saxons.</NOTE>. Nor will
<PB REF="19"/>
it prove less necessary to our purpose to observe, that the Cornish Britons, whose language was another dialect of the antient British, from the fourth or fifth century downwards, maintained a no less intimate correspondence with the natives of Armorica: intermarrying with them, and perpetually re∣sorting thither for the education of their children, for ad∣vice, for procuring troops against the Saxons, for the pur∣poses of traffick, and various other occasions. This con∣nection was so strongly kept up, that an ingenious French antiquary supposes, that the communications of the Armori∣cans with the Cornish had chiefly contributed to give a roughness or rather hardness to the romance or French language in some of the provinces, towards the eleventh century, which was not before discernible <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>M. l'Abbé Lebeuf. RECHERCHES, &amp;c.

And this inter∣course will appear more natural, if we consider, that not only Armorica, a maritime province of Gaul, never much frequented by the Romans, and now totally deserted by them, was still in some measure a Celtic nation; but that also the inhabitants of Cornwall, together with those of Devonshire and of the adjoining parts of Somersetshire, intermixing in a very slight degree with the Romans, and having suffered fewer important alterations in their original constitution and customs from the imperial laws and police than any other province of this island, long preserved their genuine manners and British character: and forming a sort of separate princi∣pality under the government of a succession of powerful chieftains, usually denominated princes or dukes of Corn∣wall, remained partly in a state of independence during the Saxon heptarchy, and were not entirely reduced till the Nor∣man conquest. Cornwall, in particular, retained its old Celtic dialect till the reign of Elizabeth <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See Camd. Brit. i. 44. edit. 1723. Lhuyd's Arch. p. 253.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB REF="20"/>
And here I digress a moment to remark, that in the circum∣stance just mentioned about Wales, of its connection with Ar∣morica, we perceive the solution of a difficulty which at first sight appears extremely problematical: I mean, not only that Wales should have been so constantly made the theatre of the old British chivalry, but that so many of the favorite fictions which occur in the early French romances, should also be literally found in the tales and chronicles of the elder Welsh bards <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The story of LE COURT MANTEL, or the BOY AND THE MANTLE, told by an old French troubadour cited by M. de Sainte Palaye, is recorded in many manuscript Welsh chronicles, as I learn from original letters of Lhuyd in the Ashmolean Museum. See Mem. Anc. Chev. i. 119. And Obs. Spenser, i. §. ii. p. 54. 55. And from the same authority I am informed, that the fiction of the giant's coat composed of the beards of the kings whom he had con∣quered, is related in the legends of the bards of both countries. See Obs. Spens. ut supr. p. 24. seq. But instances are in∣numerable.</NOTE>. It was owing to the perpetual com∣munication kept up between the Welsh, and the people of Armorica who abounded in these fictions, and who na∣turally took occasion to interweave them into the history of their friends and allies. Nor are we now at a loss to give the reason why Cornwall, in the same French romances, is made the scene and the subject of so many romantic adven∣tures <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hence in the Armorican tales just quoted, mention is made of Totness and Exeter, anciently included in Cornwall.

Their languages, customs, and alliances, as I have hinted, were the same; and they were separated only by a strait of inconsiderable breadth. Cornwall is frequently styled West-Wales by the British writers. At the invasion of the Saxons, both countries became indiscriminately the receptacle of the fugitive Bri∣tons. We find the Welsh and Cornish, as one people, often uniting themselves as in a national cause against the Saxons. They were frequently subject to the same prince <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Who was sometimes chosen from Wales and Cornwall, and sometimes from AR∣MORICA. Borlase, ubi supr. p. 403.

<P>About the year 1100, Gualter, archdeacon of Oxford, a learned man, and a diligent collector of histories, travelling through France, procured in Armorica an antient chronicle written in the British or Armorican language, entitled, BRUT∣Y-BRENHINED, or THE HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRI∣TAIN <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">In the curious library of the family of Davies at Llanerk in Denbighshire, there is a copy of this chronicle in the hand∣writing of Guttyn Owen, a celebrated Welsh bard and antiquarian about the year 1470, who ascribes it to Tyssilio a bishop, and the son of Brockmael-Yscythroc prince of Powis. Tyssilio indeed wrote a HIS∣TORY OF BRITAIN; but that work, as we are assured by Lhuyd in the ARCHAEO∣LOGIA, was entirely ecclesiastical, and has been long since lost.</NOTE>. This book he brought into England, and communi∣cated it to Geoffrey of Monmouth, a Welsh Benedictine monk, an elegant writer of Latin, and admirably skilled in the British tongue. Geoffrey, at the request and recommen∣dation of Gualter the archdeacon, translated this British chronicle into Latin <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Galfr. Mon. L. i. c. 1. xii. 1. 20. ix. 2.

<P>I am obliged to an ingenious antiqua∣rian in British literature, Mr. Morris of Penbryn, for the following curious remarks concerning Geoffrey's original and his trans∣lation. <Q>"Geoffrey's SYLVIUS, in the British original, is SILIUS, which in Latin would make JULIUS. This il∣lustrates and confirms Lambarde's, BRU∣TUS JULIUS. Peramb. Kent, p. 12. So also in the British bards. And hence Milton's objection is removed. Hist. Engl. p. 12. There are no FLAMINES or ARCHFLAMINES in the British book. See Usher's Primord. p. 57. Dubl. edit. There are very few speeches in the ori∣ginal, and those very short. Geoffrey's FULGENIUS is in the British copy SU∣LIEN, which by analogy in Latin would be JULIANUS. See Milton's Hist. Eng. p. 100. There is no LEIL in the Bri∣tish; that king's name was LLEON. Geoffrey's CAERLISLE is in the British CAERLLEON, or West-Chester. In the British, LLAW AP CYNFARCH, should have been translated LEO, which is now rendered LOTH. This has brought much confusion into the old Scotch history. I find no BELINUS in the British copy; the name is BELI, which should have been in Latin BELIUS, or BELGIUS. Geoffrey's BRENNUS in the original is BRAN, a common name among the Bri∣tons; as BRAN AP DYFNWAL, &amp;c. See Suida's <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It appears by the original, that the British name of CA∣RAUSIUS was CARAWN; hence TRE∣GARAUN, i. e. TREGARON, and the river CARAUN, which gives name to ABERCORN. In the British there is no division into books and chapters, a mark of antiquity. Those whom the trans∣lator calls CONSULS of Rome, when Brennus took it, are in the original TWYSOGION, i. e. princes or generals. The Gwalenses, GWALO, or GWALAS, are added by Geoffrey, B. xii. c. 19."</Q> To what is here observed about SILIUS, I will add, that abbot Whethamsted, in his MS. GRANARIUM, mentions SILOIUS the father of Brutus. <Q REND="inline">"Quomodo Brutus SILOII filius ad litora Angliae venit," &amp;c.</Q> <BIBL>GRANAR. Part. i. Lit. A. MSS. Cotton. NERO, C. vi. Brit.

The manuscript in Jesus college library at Oxford, which Wynne pretends to be the same which Geoffrey himself made use of, is evidently not older than the sixteenth century. Mr. Price, the Bodleian librarian, to whose friendship this work is much indebted, has two copies lately given him by Mr. Banks, much more antient and perfect. But there is reason to suspect, that most of the British manuscripts of this history are translations from Geoffrey's Latin: for <HI>Britannia</HI> they have BRYTTAEN, which in the original would have been PRYDAIN. Geoffrey's translation, and for obvious reasons, is a very common manuscript. Compare Lhuyd's Arch. p. 265.</P></NOTE>. It was probably finished after the year 1138 <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Thompson says, 1128. ubi supr. p. xxx. Geoffrey's age is ascertained beyond a doubt, even if other proofs were wanting, from the cotemporaries whom he mentions. Such as Robert earl of Glocester, natural son of Henry the first, and Alexander bi∣shop of Lincoln, his patrons: he mentions also William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon. Wharton places Geoffrey's death in the year 1154. Episc. Assav. p. 306. Robert de Monte, who continued Sigebert's chronicle down to the year 1183, in the preface to that work expresly says, that he took some of the materials of his supplement from the HISTORIA BRITO∣NUM, <HI>lately translated out of British into Latin.</HI> This was manifestly Geoffrey's book. Alfred of Beverly, who evidently wrote his ANNALES, published by Hearne, between the years 1148 and 1150, bor∣rowed his account of the British kings from Geoffrey's HISTORIA, whose words he sometimes literally transcribes. For in∣stance, Alfred, in speaking of Arthur's keeping Whitsuntide at Caerleon, says, that the HISTORIA BRITONUM enume∣rated all the kings who came thither on Arthur's invitation: and then adds, <Q REND="inline">"Prae∣ter hos non remansit princeps alicujus pretii citra Hispaniam qui ad istud edic∣tum non venerit."</Q> <BIBL>Alured. Bev. Annal. p. 63. edit. Hearne.</BIBL> These are Geoffrey's own words; and so much his own, that they are one of his additions to the British original. But the curious reader, who de∣sires a complete and critical discussion of this point, may consult an original letter of bishop Lloyd, preserved among Tanner's manuscripts at Oxford, num. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB REF="23"/>
It is difficult to ascertain exactly the period at which our translator's original romance may probably be supposed to have been compiled. Yet this is a curious speculation, and will illustrate our argument. I am inclined to think that the work consists of fables thrown out by different rhap∣sodists at different times, which afterwards were collected and digested into an entire history, and perhaps with new decorations of fancy added by the compiler, who most pro∣bably was one of the professed bards, or rather a poetical historian, of Armorica or Basse Bretagne. In this state, and under this form, I suppose it to have fallen into the hands of Geoffrey of Monmouth. If the hypothesis hereafter ad∣vanced concerning the particular species of fiction on which this narrative is founded, should be granted, it cannot, from what I have already proved, be more antient than the eighth century: and we may reasonably conclude, that it was composed much later, as some considerable length of time must have been necessary for the propagation and establish∣ment of that species of fiction. The simple subject of this chronicle, divested of its romantic embellishments, is a de∣duction of the Welsh princes from the Trojan Brutus to Cadwallader, who reigned in the seventh century <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This notion of their extraction from the Trojans had so infatuated the Welsh, that even so late as the year 1284, arch∣bishop Peckham, in his injunctions to the diocese of St. Asaph, orders the people to abstain from giving credit to idle dreams and visions, a superstition which they had contracted from their belief in thedream of their founder Brutus, in the temple of Diana, concerning his arrival in Britain. The archbishop very seriously advises them to boast no more of their relation to the conquered and fugitive Trojans, but to glory in the victorious cross of Christ. Con∣cil. Wilkins, tom. ii. p. 106. edit. 1737. fol.</NOTE>. It must
<PB REF="24"/>
be acknowledged, that many European nations were antiently fond of tracing their descent from Troy. Hunnibaldus Fran∣cus, in his Latin history of France, written in the sixth cen∣tury, beginning with the Trojan war, and ending with Clovis the first, ascribes the origin of the French nation to Francio a son of Priam <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">It is among the SCRIPTORES RER. GERMAN. Sim. Schard. tom. i. p. 301. edit. Basil. 1574. fol. It consists of eighteen books.</NOTE>. So universal was this humour, and car∣ried to such an absurd excess of extravagance, that under the reign of Justinian, even the Greeks were ambitious of being thought to be descended from the Trojans, their an∣tient and notorious enemies. Unless we adopt the idea of those antiquaries, who contend that Europe was peopled from Phrygia, it will be hard to discover at what period, or from what source, so strange and improbable a notion could take its rise, especially among nations unacquainted with history, and overwhelmed in ignorance. The most rational mode of accounting for it, is to suppose, that the revival of Virgil's Eneid about the sixth or seventh century, which re∣presented the Trojans as the founders of Rome, the capital of the supreme pontiff, and a city on various other accounts in the early ages of christianity highly reverenced and dis∣tinguished, occasioned an emulation in many other European nations of claiming an alliance to the same respectable origi∣nal. The monks and other ecclesiastics, the only readers and writers of the age, were likely to broach, and were in∣terested in propagating, such an opinion. As the more bar∣barous countries of Europe began to be tinctured with lite∣rature, there was hardly one of them but fell into the fashion of deducing its original from some of the nations most cele∣brated in the antient books. Those who did not aspire so
<PB REF="25" MS="y"/>
high as king Priam, or who found that claim preoccupied, boasted to be descended from some of the generals of Alexander the Great, from Prusias king of Bithynia, from the Greeks or the Egyptians. It it not in the mean time quite impro∣bable, that as most of the European nations were provincial to the Romans, those who fancied themselves to be of Trojan extraction might have imbibed this notion, at least have ac∣quired a general knowledge of the Trojan story, from their conquerors: more especially the Britons, who continued so long under the yoke of Rome <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See infr. SECT. iii. p. 127, 128.</NOTE>. But as to the story of Brutus in particular, Geoffrey's hero, it may be presumed that his legend was not contrived, nor the history of his successors invented, till after the ninth century: for Nennius, who lived about the middle of that century, not only speaks of Brutus with great obscurity and inconsistency, but seems totally uninformed as to every circumstance of the British affairs which preceded Cesar's invasion. There are other proofs that this piece could not have existed before the ninth century. Alfred's Saxon translation of the Mercian law is mentioned <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">L. iii. c. 13.</NOTE>. Charlemagne's Twelve Peers, and by an ana∣chronism not uncommon in romance, are said to be present at king Arthur's magnificent coronation in the city of Caer∣leon <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">L. ix. c. 12.</NOTE>. It were easy to produce instances, that this chronicle was undoubtedly framed after the legend of saint Ursula, the acts of saint Lucius, and the historical writings of the venerable Bede, had undergone some degree of circulation in the world. At the same time it contains many passages which incline us to determine, that some parts of it at least were written after or about the eleventh century. I will not insist on that passage, in which the title of legate of the apostolic see is attributed to Dubricius in the character of primate of Britain; as it appears for obvious reasons to have been an artful interpolation of the translator, who was an ecclesiastic. But I will select other arguments. Canute's forest, or Cannock-wood

in Staffordshire occurs; and Canute died in the year 1036 <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">L. vii. c. 4.</NOTE>. At the ideal coronation of king Arthur, just mentioned, a tournament is described as exhibited in its highest splendor. <Q REND="inline">"Many knights, says our Armoric fa∣bler, famous for feats of chivalry, were present, with ap∣parel and arms of the same colour and fashion. They formed a species of diversion, in imitation of a fight on horseback, and the ladies being placed on the walls of the castles, darted amorous glances on the combatants. None of these ladies esteemed any knight worthy of her love, but such as had given proof of his gallantry in three several encounters. Thus the valour of the men encou∣raged chastity in the women, and the attention of the wo∣men proved an incentive to the soldier's bravery <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">L. ix. c. 12.</NOTE>."</Q> Here is the practice of chivalry under the combined ideas of love and military prowess, as they seem to have subsisted after the feudal constitution had acquired greater degrees not only of stability but of splendor and refinement <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pitts mentions an anonymous writer un∣der the name of EREMITA BRITANNUS, who studied history and astronomy, and flourished about the year 720.

And although a species of tournament was exhibited in France at the recon∣ciliation of the sons of Lewis the feeble, in the close of the ninth century, and at the beginning of the tenth, the co∣ronation of the emperor Henry was solemnized with mar∣tial entertainments, in which many parties were introduced fighting on horseback; yet it was long afterwards that these games were accompanied with the peculiar formalities, and ceremonious usages, here described <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>See infr.

In the mean time, we
<PB REF="27"/>
cannot answer for the innovations of a translator in such a description. The burial of Hengist, the Saxon chief, who is said to have been interred not after the <HI>pagan</HI> fashion, as Geoffrey renders the words of the original, but after the <HI>manner of the</HI> SOLDANS, is partly an argument that our ro∣mance was composed about the time of the crusades. It was not till those memorable campaigns of mistaken devotion had infatuated the western world, that the soldans or sultans of Babylon, of Egypt, of Iconium, and other eastern kingdoms, became familiar in Europe. Not that the notion of this piece being written so late as the crusades in the least invalidates the doctrine delivered in this discourse. Not even if we sup∣pose that Geoffrey of Monmouth was its original composer. That notion rather tends to confirm and establish my system. On the whole we may venture to affirm, that this chronicle, supposed to contain the ideas of the Welsh bards, entirely consists of Arabian inventions. And, in this view, no dif∣ference is made whether it was compiled about the tenth century, at which time, if not before, the Arabians from their settlement in Spain must have communicated their ro∣mantic fables to other parts of Europe, especially to the French; or whether it first appeared in the eleventh cen∣tury, after the crusades had multiplied these fables to an ex∣cessive degree, and made them universally popular. And al∣though the general cast of the inventions contained in this romance is alone sufficient to point out the source from whence they were derived, yet I chuse to prove to a demon∣stration what is here advanced, by producing and examining some particular passages.</P>
<P>The books of the Arabians and Persians abound with ex∣travagant traditions about the giants Gog and Magog. These they call Jagiouge and Magiouge; and the Caucasian wall,

This wall, some few fragments of which still remain, they pre∣tend to have been built with all sorts of metals. See Abulfaraj Hist. Dynast. edit. Pococke, p. 62. A. D. 1673. It was an old tradition among the Tartars, that the people of Jajgioue and Majiouge were perpetually endeavouring to make a passage through this fortress; but that they would not succeed in their attempt till the day of judgment. See Hist. Geneal. des Tartars, d'Abulgazi Bahadut Khân. p. 43. About the year 808, the caliph Al Amin having heard wonderful reports concerning this wall or barrier, sent his interpreter Salam, with a guard of fifty men, to view it. After a dangerous journey of near two months, Salam and his party arrived in a desolated country, where they beheld the ruins of many cities destroyed by the people of Ja∣jiouge and Majiouge. In six days more they reached the castles near the mountain Kokaiya or Caucasus. This mountain is inaccessibly steep, perpetually covered with snows and thick clouds, and encompasses the country of Jagiouge and Magiouge, which is full of cultivated fields and cities. At an opening of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mountain the fortress appears: and trave ling forwards, at the distance of two stages, they found another mountain, with a ditch cut through it one hundred and fifty cubits wide; and within the aperture an iron gate fifty cubits high, supported by vast buttresses, having an iron bulwark crowned with iron turrets, reach∣ing to the summit of the mountain itself, which is too high to be seen. The valves, lintels, threshold, bolts, lock and key, are all represented of proportionable mag∣nitude. The governor of the castle above∣mentioned, once in every week mounted on horseback with ten others on horseback, comes to this gate, and striking it three times with a hammer weighing five pounds, and then listening, hears a murmuring noise from within. This noise is supposed to proceed from the Jagiouge and Magiouge confined there. Salam was told that they often appeared on the battlements of the bulwark. He returned after passing twenty∣eight months in this extraordinary expedi∣tion. See Mod. Univ. Hist. vol. iv. B. i. § 2. pag. 15. 16. 17. And Anc. vol. xx. pag. 23.

In some other parts it is still six or seven feet in heighth. It seems at first sight to be built of stone: but it consists of petrified earth, sand, and shells, which compose a substance of great solidity. It has been chiefly destroyed by the neighbouring inhabitants, for the sake of its materials: and most of the adjacent towns and villages are built out of its ruins.

By the way, this work probably preceded the time of Alexander: it does not appear, from the course of his victories, that he ever came near the Caspian gates. The first and fa∣bulous history of the eastern nations, will perhaps be found to begin with the exploits of this Grecian hero.</NOTE>. One of the most formidable giants, according to our Armorican romance,
<PB REF="29"/>
which opposed the landing of Brutus in Britain, was Goemagot. He was twelve cubits high, and would unroot an oak as easily as an hazel wand: but after a most obsti∣nate encounter with Corineus, he was tumbled into the sea from the summit of a steep cliff on the rocky shores of Corn∣wall, and dashed in pieces against the huge crags of the de∣clivity. The place where he fell, adds our historian, taking its name from the giant's fall, is called LAM-GOEMAGOT, or GOEMAGOT'S LEAP, to this day <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. c. 16.</NOTE>. A no less monstrous giant, whom king Arthur slew on Saint Michael's Mount in Corn∣wall, is said by this fabler to have come from Spain. Here the origin of these stories is evidently betrayed <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">L. x. c. 3.</NOTE>. The Ara∣bians, or Saracens, as I have hinted above, had conquered Spain, and were settled there. Arthur having killed this redoubted giant, declares, that he had combated with none of equal strength and prowess, since he overcame the mighty giant Ritho, on the mountain Arabius, who had made himself a robe of the beards of the kings whom he had killed. This tale is in Spenser's Faerie Queene.

It is obvious to suppose how these countries became so familiar to the bard of our chronicle. The old fictions about Stonehenge were derived from the same inexhaustible source of extravagant imagina∣tion. We are told in this romance, that the giants con∣veyed the stones which compose this miraculous monument from the farthest coasts of Africa. Every one of these stones is supposed to be mystical, and to contain a medicinal virtue: an idea drawn from the medical skill of the Arabians <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See infr. SECT. i. p. 10. And SECT. xiii. p. 378. infr.</NOTE>, and more particularly from the Arabian doctrine of attri∣buting healing qualities, and other occult properties, to stones <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">This chronicle was evidently compiled to do honour to the Britons and their affairs, and especially in opposition to the Saxons. Now the importance with which these romancers seem to speak of Stone∣henge, and the many beautiful fictions with which they have been so studious to em∣bellish its origin, and to aggrandise its history, appear to me strongly to favour the hypothesis, that Stonehenge is a British monument; and indeed to prove, that it was really erected in memory of the three hun∣dred British nobles massacred by the Saxon Hengist. See SECT. ii. infr. p. 52. No DRUIDICAL monument, of which so many remains were common, engaged their at∣tention or interested them so much, as this NATIONAL memorial appears to have done.</NOTE>. Merlin's transformation of Uther into Gorlois, and of Ulfin into Bricel, by the power of some medical pre∣paration, is a species of Arabian magic, which professed to work the most wonderful deceptions of this kind, and is men∣tioned at large hereafter, in tracing the inventions of Chaucer's poetry. The attribution of prophetical language to birds was common among the orientals: and an eagle is supposed to speak at building the walls of the city of Paladur, now Shaftesbury <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii. c. 9.

<P>Arthur and Charlemagne are the first and original heroes of romance.

The christians under Charlemagne are said to have found in Spain a golden idol, or image of Mahomet, as high as a bird can fly. It was framed by Mahomet himself of the purest metal, who by his knowledge in necromancy had sealed up within it a legion of diabolical spirits. It held in its hand a prodigious club; and the Saracens had a prophetic tradition, that this club should fall from the hand of the image in that year when a certain king should be born in France, &amp;c.

<P>Some suppose, as I have hinted above, this romance to have been written by Turpin, a monk of the eighth century; who, for his knowledge of the Latin language, his sanctity, and gallant exploits against the Spanish Saracens, was pre∣ferred to the archbishoprick of Rheims by Charlemagne.

<P>Voltaire, a writer of much deeper research than is ima∣gined, and the first who has displayed the literature and customs of the dark ages with any degree of penetration and comprehension, speaking of the fictitious tales concern∣ing Charlemagne, has remarked, <Q REND="inline">"Ces fables qu'un moine ecrivit au onzieme siecle, sous le nom de l'archeveque Turpin <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">"Hist.

That is, on the recent pub∣lication of this fabulous history of Charlemagne. Historical evidence concurs with numerous internal arguments to prove, that it must have been compiled after the crusades.

<P>There is another strong internal proof that this romance was written long after the time of Charlemagne. Our his∣torian is speaking of the numerous chiefs and kings who came with their armies to assist his hero: among the rest he mentions earl Oell, and adds, <Q REND="inline">"Of this man there is a song commonly sung among the minstrels <HI>even to this day</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q>"De hoc canitur in Cantilena <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sque <HI>ad hodiernum diem.</HI>"</Q> <BIBL>cap. xi. f. 4. b. edit.

However we may suspect it appeared before, yet not long before, Geof∣frey's romance; who mentions Charlemagne's TWELVE PEERS, so lavishly celebrated in Turpin's book, as present at king Arthur's imaginary coronation at Caer-leon.

I will re∣late one from that lively picture of the Spaniards, RELATION DU VOYAGE D'ES∣PAGNE, by Madamoiselle Danois. With∣in the antient castle of Toledo, they say, there was a vast cavern whose entrance was strongly barricadoed. It was universally believed, that if any person entered this cavern, the most fatal disasters would hap∣pen to the Spaniards. Thus it remained closely shut and unentered for many ages. At length king Roderigo, having less cre∣dulity but more courage and curiosity than his ancestors, commanded this formidable recess to be opened. At entering, he began to suspect the traditions of the peo∣ple to be true: a terrible tempest arose, and all the elements seemed united to embar∣rass him. Nevertheless, he ventured for∣wards into the cave, where he discerned by the light of his torches certain figures on sta∣tues of men, whose habiliments and arms were strange and uncouth. One of them had a sword of shining brass, on which it was written in Arabic characters, that the time approached when the Spanish nation should be destroyed, and that it would not be long before the warriors, whose images were placed there, should arrive in Spain. The writer adds, <Q REND="inline">"Je n'ai jamais été en aucun endroit, où l'on fasse PLUS DE CAS des CONTES FABULEUX qu'en Espagne."</Q> <BIBL>Edit. a la Haye, 1691. tom. iii. p. 158. 159. 12mo.</BIBL> See infr.

And, by the way, from the translator's declaration, that there was a great im∣propriety in translating Latin prose into verse, we may con∣clude, that at the commencement of the thirteenth century the French generally made their translations into verse.</P>
<P>In these two fabulous chronicles the foundations of romance seem to be laid. The principal characters, the leading sub∣jects, and the fundamental fictions, which have supplied such ample matter to this singular species of composition, are here first displayed. And although the long continuance of the crusades imported innumerable inventions of a similar complexion, and substituted the atchievements of new cham∣pions and the wonders of other countries, yet the tales of Arthur and of Charlemagne, diversified indeed, or enlarged with additional embellishments, still continued to prevail, and to be the favourite topics: and this, partly from their early popularity, partly from the quantity and the beauty of the fictions with which they were at first supported, and especially because the design of the crusades had made those subjects so fashionable in which christians fought with infi∣dels. In a word, these volumes are the first specimens
<PB REF="36"/>
extant in this mode of writing. No European history before these has mentioned giants, enchanters, dragons, and the like monstrous and arbitrary fictions. And the reason is obvious: they were written at a time when a new and unnatural mode of thinking took place in Europe, intro∣duced by our communication with the east.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have considered the Saracens either at their immigration into Spain about the ninth century, or at the time of the crusades, as the first authors of romantic fabling among the Europeans. But a late ingenious critic has advanced an hypothesis, which assigns a new source, and a much earlier date, to these fictions. I will cite his opinion of this matter in his own words. <Q REND="inline">"Our old romances of chivalry may be derived in a LINEAL DES∣CENT from the antient historical songs of the Gothic bards and scalds.—Many of those songs are still preserved in the north, which exhibit all the seeds of chivalry before it became a solemn institution.—Even the com∣mon arbitrary fictions of romance were most of them familiar to the antient scalds of the north, long before the time of the crusades. They believed the existence of giants and dwarfs, they had some notion of fairies, they were strongly possessed with the belief of spells and in∣chantment, and were fond of inventing combats with dragons and monsters <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Percy, on, ANTIENT METR. ROM. i. p. 3. 4. edit. 1767.</NOTE>."</Q> Monsieur Mallet, a very able and elegant inquirer into the genius and antiquities of the northern nations, mantains the same doctrine. He seems to think, that many of the opinions and practices of the Goths, however obsolete, still obscurely subsist. He adds, <Q REND="inline">"May we not rank among these, for example, that love and admiration for the profession of arms which prevailed among our ancestors even to fanaticism, and as it were through system, and brave from a point of honour?—
<PB REF="37"/>
Can we not explain from the Gothic religion, how judi∣ciary combats, and proofs by the ordeal, to the astonish∣ment of posterity, were admitted by the legislature of all Europe <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">For the judiciary combats, as also for common athletic exercises, they formed an amphitheatrical circus of rude stones. <Q REND="inline">"Quae∣dam [saxa] CIRCOS claudebant, in qui∣bus gigantes et pugiles DUELLO strenue decertabant."</Q><BIBL>Worm. p. 62.</BIBL> And again, <Q REND="inline">"Nec mora, CIRCUATUR campus, milite CIRCUS stipatur, concurrunt pugiles."</Q> <BIBL>p. 65.</BIBL> It is remarkable, that circs of the same sort are still to be seen in Cornwall, so famous at this day for the athletic art: in which also they sometimes exhibited their scriptural interludes. See infr. SECT. vi. p. 237. Frotho the Great, king of Denmark, in the first century, is said to have been the first who commanded all controversies to be decided by the sword. Worm. p. 68. In favour of this barbarous institution it ought to be remembered, that the practice of thus marking out the place of battle must have prevented much blood∣shed, and saved many innocent lives: for if either combatant was by any accident forced out of the circus, he was to lose his cause, or to pay three marks of pure silver as a redemption for his life. Worm. p. 68, 69. In the year 987, the ordeal was substituted in Denmark instead of the duel; a mode of decision, at least in a political sense, less absurd, as it promoted military skill.</NOTE>: and how, even to the present age, the people are still infatuated with a belief of the power of magi∣cians, witches, spirits, and genii, concealed under the earth or in the waters?—Do we not discover in these religious opinions, that source of the marvellous with which our ancestors filled their romances; in which we see dwarfs and giants, fairies and demons," &amp;c <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mallet, Introduction a l' Histoire de Dannemarc, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 9.</NOTE>.</Q> And in another place. <Q REND="inline">"The fortresses of the Goths were only rude castles situated on the summits of rocks, and rendered inaccessible by thick misshapen walls. As these walls ran winding round the castles, they often called them by a name which signified SERPENTS or DRAGONS; and in these they usually secured the women and young virgins of distinction, who were seldom safe at a time when so many enterprising heroes were rambling up and down in search of adven∣tures. It was this custom which gave occasion to antient romancers, who knew not how to describe any thing simply, to invent so many fables concerning princesses of great beauty guarded by dragons, and afterwards delivered by invincible champions <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ib. ch. ix. p. 243. tom. ii.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>This migration is confirmed by the concurrent testimo∣nies of various historians: but there is no better evidence of it, than that conspicuous similarity subsisting at this day between several customs of the Georgians, as described by Chardin, and those of certain cantons of Norway and Swe∣den, which have preserved their antient manners in the purest degree <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>toppidan.

Mahomet, not so great an inventor as is imagined, adopted into his religion many favourite no∣tions and superstitions from the bordering nations which were the offspring of the Scythians, and especially from the Turks. Accordingly, we find the Alcoran agreeing with the Runic theology in various instances. I will mention only one. It is one of the beatitudes of the Mahometan paradise, that blooming virgins shall administer the most luscious wines.

be added, some of which will occasionally arise in the future course of our inquiries.</P>
<P>It is notorious, that many traces of oriental usages are found amongst all the European nations during their pagan state; and this phenomenon is rationally resolved, on the supposition that all Europe was originally peopled from the east. But as the resemblance which the pagan Scandina∣vians bore to the eastern nations in manners, monu∣ments, opinions, and practices, is so very perceptible and apparent, an inference arises, that their migration from the east must have happened at a period by many ages more recent, and therefore most probably about the time specified by their historians. In the mean time we must re∣member, that a distinction is to be made between this expe∣dition of Odin's Goths, who formed a settlement in Scandi∣navia, and those innumerable armies of barbarous adventu∣rers, who some centuries afterwards, distinguished by the same name, at different periods overwhelmed Europe, and at length extinguished the Roman empire.</P>
<P>When we consider the rapid conquests of the nations which may be comprehended under the common name of Scythians, and not only those conducted by Odin, but by Attila, Theodoric, and Genseric, we cannot ascribe such suc∣cesses to brutal courage only. To say that some of these irresistible conquerors made war on a luxurious, effeminate, and enervated people, is a plausible and easy mode of ac∣counting for their conquests: but this reason will not ope∣rate with equal force in the histories of Genghizcan and
<PB REF="43"/>
Tamerlane, who destroyed mighty empires founded on arms and military discipline, and who baffled the efforts of the ablest leaders. Their science and genius in war, such as it then was, cannot therefore be doubted: that they were not deficient in the arts of peace, I have already hinted, and now proceed to produce more particular proofs. Innumerable and very fundamental errors have crept into our reasonings and systems about savage life, resulting merely from those strong and undistinguishing notions of barbarism, which our prejudices have hastily formed concerning the character of all rude nations <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See this argument pursued in the fol∣lowing DISSERTATION.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among other arts which Odin's Goths planted in Scandi∣navia, their skill in poetry, to which they were addicted in a peculiar manner, and which they cultivated with a won∣derful enthusiasm, seems to be most worthy our regard, and especially in our present inquiry.</P>
<P>As the principal heroes of their expedition into the north were honourably distinguished from the Europeans, or ori∣ginal Scandinavians, under the name of Asae, or Asiatics, so the verses, or language, of this people, were denominated ASAMAL, or ASIATIC speech <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Linguam Danicam antiquam, cujus in rythmis usus fuit, veteres appellarunt ASAMAL, id est Asiaticam, vel ASARUM SERMONEM; quod eum ex Asia Odinus secum in Daniam, Norwegiam, Sueciam, aliasque regiones septentrionales, invex∣erit."</Q> <BIBL>Steph. Stephan. Praefat. ad Saxon. Grammat. Hist.</BIBL></NOTE>. Their poetry contained not only the praises of their heroes, but their popular traditions and their religious rites; and was filled with those fictions which the most exaggerated pagan superstition would natu∣rally implant in the wild imaginations of an Asiatic people. And from this principle alone, I mean of their Asiatic origin, some critics would at once account for a certain capricious spirit of extravagance, and those bold eccentric conceptions, which so strongly distinguish the old northern poetry <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">A most ingenious critic observes, that <Q REND="inline">"what we have been long accustomed to call the ORIENTAL VEIN of poetry, because some of the EARLIEST poetical productions have come to us from the east, is probably no more ORIENTAL than OCCIDENTAL."</Q> <BIBL>Blair's Crit. Diss. on Ossian. vol. ii. p. 317.</BIBL> But all the LA∣TER oriental writers through all ages have been particularly distinguished for this VEIN. Hence it is here characteristical of a country not of an age. I will allow, on this writer's very just and penetrating principles, that an early northern ode shall be as sublime as an eastern one. Yet the sublimity of the latter shall have a different character; it will be more inflated and gigantic.</NOTE>. Nor

is this fantastic imagery, the only mark of Asiaticism which appears in the Runic odes. They have a certain sublime and figurative cast of diction, which is indeed one of their pre∣dominant characteristics <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thus, a Rainbow is called,</HI> the bridge of the gods. <HI>Poetry,</HI> the mead of Odin. <HI>The earth,</HI> the vessel that floats on ages. <HI>A ship,</HI> the horse of the waves. <HI>Ice,</HI> the vast bridge. <HI>Herbs,</HI> the fleece of the earth. <HI>A Battle,</HI> a bath of blood, the hail of Odin, the shock of bucklers. <HI>A Tongue,</HI> the sword of words. <HI>Night,</HI> the veil of cares. <HI>Rocks,</HI> the bones of the earth. <HI>Arrows,</HI> the hailst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el∣mets, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE>. I am very sensible that all rude nations are naturally apt to cloath their sentiments in this style. A propensity to this mode of expression is necessarily occasioned by the poverty of their language, which obliges them frequently to substitute similitudes and circumlocu∣tions: it arises in great measure from feelings undisguised and unrestrained by custom or art, and from the genuine efforts of nature working more at large in uncultivated minds. In the infancy of society, the passions and the imagination are alike uncontrouled. But another cause seems to have con∣curred in producing the effect here mentioned. When ob∣vious terms and phrases evidently occurred, the Runic poets are fond of departing from the common and established dic∣tion. They appear to use circumlocution and comparisons not as a matter of necessity, but of choice and skill: nor are these metaphorical colourings so much the result of want of words, as of warmth of fancy <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">In a strict geographical sense, the ori∣ginal country of these Asiatic Goths might not be so situated as physically to have produced these effects. Yet it is to be ob∣served, that intercourse and vicinity are in this case sometimes equivalent to climate. The Persian traditions and superstitions were current even in the northern parts of Tartary. Georgia, however, may be fairly considered as a part of Persia. It is equal in fertility to any of the eastern Turkish provinces in Asia. It affords the richest wines, and other luxuries of life, in the greatest abundance. The most beautiful virgins for the seraglio are fetched from this province. In the mean time, thus much at least may be said of a warm climate, exclusive of its supposed immediate physi∣cal influence on the human mind and tem∣perament. It exhibits all the productions of nature in their highest perfection and beauty: while the excessive heat of the sun, and the fewer incitements to labour and in∣dustry, dispose the inhabitants to indolence, and to living much abroad in scenes of na∣ture. These circumstances are favourable to the operations of fancy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB REF="45"/>
Their warmth of fancy, however, if supposed to have proceeded from the principles above suggested, in a few ge∣nerations after this migration into Scandinavia, must have lost much of its natural heat and genuine force. Yet ideas and sentiments, especially of this sort, once imbibed, are long remembered and retained, in savage life. Their reli∣gion, among other causes, might have contributed to keep this spirit alive; and to preserve their original stock of images, and native mode of expression, unchanged and una∣bated by climate or country. In the mean time we may suppose, that the new situation of these people in Scan∣dinavia, might have added a darker shade and a more savage complexion to their former fictions and superstitions; and that the formidable objects of nature to which they became familiarised in those northern solitudes, the piny precipices, the frozen mountains, and the gloomy forests, acted on their imaginations, and gave a tincture of horror to their imagery.</P>
<P>A skill in poetry seems in some measure to have been a national science among the Scandinavians, and to have been familiar to almost every order and degree. Their kings and warriors partook of this epidemic enthusiasm, and on fre∣quent occasions are represented as breaking forth into spon∣taneous songs and verses <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Harold Hardraade, king of Norway, composed sixteen songs of his expedition into Africa.

talent was properly confined to a stated profession: and with their poetry the Goths imported into Europe a species of poets or singers, whom they called SCALDS or POLISHERS of LANGUAGE. This order of men, as we shall see more distinctly below, was held in the highest honour and vene∣ration: they received the most liberal rewards for their verses, attended the festivals of heroic chiefs, accompanied them in battle, and celebrated their victories <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The Sogdians were a people who lived eastward of the Caspian sea, not far from the country of Odin's Goths.

From the correspondence of manners and princi∣ples it holds forth between the Scandina∣vians and the Sogdians, it contains a strik∣ing proof of Odin's migration from the east to the north: first, in the spontaneous exercise of the poetical talent; and se∣condly, in the opinion, that a glorious or warlike death, which admitted them to the company of their friends and parents in another world, was to be embraced with the most eager alacrity, and the highest sensations of pleasure. This is the doc∣trine of the Edda. In the same spirit, RIDENS MORIAR is the triumphant close of Regner Lodbrog's dying ode.

<P>These Scandinavian bards appear to have been esteemed and entertained in other countries besides their own, and by that means to have probably communicated their fictions to various parts of Europe. I will give my reasons for this supposition.</P>
<P>In the early ages of Europe, before many regular govern∣ments took place, revolutions, emigrations, and invasions, were frequent and almost universal. Nations were alternately
<PB REF="47"/>
destroyed or formed; and the want of political security exposed the inhabitants of every country to a state of eternal fluctuation. That Britain was originally peopled from Gaul, a nation of the Celts, is allowed: but that many colonies from the northern parts of Europe were afterwards suc∣cessively planted in Britain and the neighbouring islands, is an hypothesis equally rational, and not altogether destitute of historical evidence. Nor was any nation more likely than the Scandinavian Goths, I mean in their early periods, to make descents on Britain. They possessed the spirit of adventure in an eminent degree. They were habituated to dangerous enterprises. They were acquainted with distant coasts, exercised in navigation, and fond of making expe∣ditions, in hopes of conquest, and in search of new acqui∣sitions. As to Scotland and Ireland, there is the highest probability, that the Scutes, who conquered both those coun∣tries, and possessed them under the names of Albin Scutes and Irin Scutes, were a people of Norway. The Caledo∣nians are expressly called by many judicious antiquaries a Scandinavian colony. The names of places and persons, over all that part of Scotland which the Picts inhabited, are of Scandinavian extraction. A simple catalogue of them only, would immediately convince us, that they are not of Celtic, or British, origin. Flaherty reports it as a re∣ceived opinion, and a general doctrine, that the Picts mi∣grated into Britain and Ireland from Scandinavia <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>It is conjectured by Wormius, that <HI>Ire∣land</HI> is derived from the Runic Yr, a bow, for the use of which the Irish were once famous.

I for∣bear to accumulate a pedantic parade of authorities on this occasion: nor can it be expected that I should enter into a formal and exact examination of this obscure and complicated
<PB REF="48"/>
subject in its full extent, which is here only intro∣duced incidentally. I will only add, that Scotland and Ire∣land, as being situated more to the north, and probably less difficult of access than Britain, might have been objects on which our northern adventurers were invited to try some of their earliest excursions: and that the Orkney-islands remained long under the jurisdiction of the Norwegian potentates.</P>
<P>In these expeditions, the northern emigrants, as we shall prove more particularly below, were undoubtedly attended by their scalds or poets. Yet even in times of peace, and without the supposition of conquest or invasion, the Scan∣dinavian scalds might have been well known in the British islands. Possessed of a specious and pleasing talent, they fre∣quented the courts of the British, Scottish, and Irish chief∣tains. They were itinerants by their institution, and made voyages, out of curiosity, or in quest of rewards, to those islands or coasts which lay within the circle of their mari∣time knowledge. By these means, they established an in∣terest, rendered their profession popular, propagated their art, and circulated their fictions, in other countries, and at a distance from home. Torfaeus asserts positively, that various Islandic odes now remain, which were sung by the Scandinavian bards before the kings of England and Ireland, and for which they received liberal gratuities <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Torf. Hist. Orcad. in Praefat.</NOTE>. They were more especially caressed and rewarded at the courts of those princes, who were distinguished for their warlike character, and their passion for military glory.</P>
<P>Olaus Wormius informs us, that great numbers of the northern scalds constantly resided in the courts of the kings of Sweden, Denmark, and England <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lit. Dan. p. 195. ed. 4to.</NOTE>. Hence the tradition in an antient Islandic Saga, or poetical history, may be ex∣plained; which says, that Odin's language was originally
<PB REF="49"/>
used, not only in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, but even in England <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. iii. 2. p. 651. It was a constant old British tradition, that king Arthur conquered Ireland, Gothland, Den∣mark, and Norway. See Galfrid. Monum. ix. 11. Rob. of Glouc. ed. Hearne, p. 180. 182. What is said in the text must have greatly facilitated the Saxon and Danish conquests in England. The works of the genuine Caedmon are written in the lan∣guage of the antient Angles, who were nearly connected with the Jutes. Hence that language resembled the antient Danish, as appears from passages of Caedmon cited by Wanley. Hence also it happened, that the later Dano-Saxonic dialect, in which Junius's POETICAL PARAPHRASE OF GENESIS was written, is likewise so very similar to the language of the antient Angles, who settled in the more northern parts of England. And in this dialect, which indeed prevailed in some degree almost over all England, many other poems are composed, mentioned likewise in Wan∣ley's Catalogue. It is the constant doctrine of the Danish historians, that the Danes and Angles, whose successors gave the name to this island, had the same origin.</NOTE>. Indeed it may be naturally concluded from these suggestions, that the Scandinavian tongue became fami∣liar in the British islands by the songs of the scalds: unless it be rather presumed, that a previous knowledge of that tongue in Britain was the means of facilitating the admission of those poets, and preparing the way for their reception.</P>
<P>And here it will be much to our present argument to observe, that some of the old Gothic and Scandinavian su∣perstitions are to this day retained in the English language. MARA, from whence our Night-mare is derived, was in the Runic theology a spirit or spectre of the night, which seized men in their sleep, and suddenly deprived them of speech and motion <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See Keysler, Antiquitat.

And in ADDEND. ibid. p. 588.</NOTE>. BOH was one of the most fierce and formidable of the Gothic generals <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Keysler, ibid. p. 105. p. 130.</NOTE>, and the son of Odin: the mention of whose name only was sufficient to spread an immediate panic among his enemies <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Temple's Essays, part 4. pag. 346. See also instances of conformity between English and Gothic superstitions in Bar∣tholinus, L. ii. cap. 2. p. 262. 266. It may be urged, that these superstitions might be introduced by the Danes; of whom I shall speak below. But this brings us to just the same point. The learned Hickes was of opinion, from a multitude of instances, that our trials by a jury of Twelve, was an early Scandinavian in∣stitution, and that it was brought from thence into England. Yet he supposes, at a period later than is necessary, the Nor∣man invasion. See Wootton's Conspectus of Hickes's Thesaur. pag. 46. Lond. 1708. And Hickes. Thesaur. Dissertat.

In the Dia∣logue between Hervor and Angantyr, the latter promises to give Hervor TWELVE MENS DEATHS. Hervarer-Saga, apud Ol. Verel. cap. vii. p. 91. The Druidical circular monuments of separate stones erect, are more frequently of the number TWELVE, than of any other number. See Borlase, ANTIQUIT. Cornw. B. iii. ch. vii. edit. 1769. fol. And Toland, Hist. Druid. p. 89. 158. 160. Se also Martin's Hebrid. p. 9. In Zealand and Sweden, many antient circular monuments, consisting each of twelve rude stones, still remain, which were the places of judicature. My late very learned, ingenious, and respected friend, doctor Borlase, pointed out to me monuments of the same sort in Cornwall. Compare Keysler, p. 93. And it will illustrate remarks already made, and the principles insinuated in this Dissertation, to observe, that these monuments are found in Persia near Tanris. Geoffrey of Monmouth affords instances in his British History. The knights sent into Wales by Fitzhammon, in 1091, were TWELVE. Powel, p. 124. sub anno.

But I will give a literal English translation of this poem, which can∣not be well understood without premising its occasion. In the year 938, Anlaff, a pagan king of the Hybernians and the adjacent isles, invited by Constantine king of the Scots, en∣tered the river Abi or Humber with a strong fleet. Our Saxon king Athelstan, and his brother Eadmund Clito, met them with a numerous army, near a place called Brunen∣burgh; and after a most obstinate and bloody resistance, drove them back to their ships. The battle lasted from day∣break till the evening. On the side of Anlaff were slain six petty kings, and seven chiefs or generals. <Q>"King Adelstan, the glory of leaders, the giver of gold chains to his nobles, and his brother Eadmund, both shining with the bright∣ness of a long train of ancestors, struck [the adversary] in war; at Brunenburgh, with the edge of the sword, they clove the wall of shields. The high banners fell. The earls of the departed Edward fell; for it was born within them, even from the loins of their kindred, to defend the treasures and the houses of their country, and
<PB REF="53"/>
their gifts, against the hatred of strangers. The nation of the Scots, and the fatal inhabitants of ships, fell. The hills resounded, and the armed men were covered with sweat. From the time the sun, the king of stars, the torch of the eternal one, rose chearful above the hills, till he returned to his habitation. There lay many of the northern men, pierced with lances; they lay wounded, with their shields pierced through: and also the Scots, the hateful harvest of battle. The chosen bands of the West-Saxons, going out to battle, pressed on the steps of the detested nations, and slew their flying rear with sharp and bloody swords. The soft effeminate men yielded up their spears. The Mercians did not fear or fly the rough game of the hand. There was no safety to them, who sought the land with Anlaff in the bosom of the ship, to die in fight. Five youthful kings fell in the place of fight, slain with swords; and seven captains of Anlaff, with the innumerable army of Scottish mariners: there the lord of the Normans [Northern-men] was chased; and their army, now made small, was driven to the prow of the ship. The ship sounded with the waves; and the king, marching into the yellow sea, escaped alive. And so it was, the wise northern king Constantine, a veteran chief, returning by flight to his own army, bowed down in the camp, left his own son worn out with wounds in the place of slaughter; in vain did he lament his earls, in vain his lost friends. Nor less did Anlaff, the yellow∣haired leader, the battle-ax of slaughter, a youth in war, but an old man in understanding, boast himself a con∣queror in fight, when the darts flew against Edward's earls, and their banners met. Then those northern sol∣diers, covered with shame, the sad refuse of darts in the resounding whirlpool of Humber, departed in their ships with rudders, to seek through the deep the Irish city and their own land. While both the brothers, the
<PB REF="54"/>
king and Clito, lamenting even their own victory, toge∣ther returned home; leaving behind them the flesh-de∣vouring raven, the dark-blue toad greedy of slaughter, the black crow with horny bill, and the hoarse toad, the eagle a companion of battles with the devouring kite, and that brindled savage beast the wolf of the wood, to be glutted with the white food of the slain. Never was so great a slaughter in this island, since the Angles and Saxons, the fierce beginners of war, coming hither from the east, and seeking Britain through the wide sea, over∣came the Britons excelling in honour, and gained pos∣session of their land <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The original was first printed by Whe∣loc in the Saxon Chronicle, p. 555.

<P>This piece, and many other Saxon odes and songs now remaining, are written in a metre much resembling that of the scaldic dialogue at the tomb of Angantyr, which has been beautifully translated into English, in the true spirit of the original, and in a genuine strain of poetry, by Gray. The extemporaneous effusions of the glowing bard seem na∣turally to have fallen into this measure, and it was probably more easily suited to the voice or harp. Their versification for the most part seems to have been that of the Runic poetry.</P>
<P>As literature, the certain attendant, as it is the parent, of true religion and civility, gained ground among the Saxons, poetry no longer remained a separate science, and the profession of bard seems gradually to have declined among them: I mean the bard under those appropriated characteristics, and that peculiar appointment, which he sustained among the Scandinavian pagans.

Fabyan, speaking of Blage∣bride, an antient British king, famous for his skill in poetry and music, calls him <Q REND="inline">"a conynge musicyan, called of the Bri∣tons god of GLEEMEN.</Q> <BIBL>CHRON. f. xxxii. ed. 1533.</BIBL> This, Fabyan tran∣slated from Geoffrey of Monmouth's ac∣count of the same British king, <Q REND="inline">"ut DEUS JOCULATORUM videretur."</Q> <BIBL>Hist.

<PB REF="55"/>
rise to the order of English Minstrels, who flourished till the sixteenth century.</P>
<P>And here I stop to point out one of the principal reasons, why the Scandinavian bards have transmitted to modern times so much more of their native poetry, than the rest of their southern neighbours. It is true, that the inhabitants of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, whether or no from their Asiatic origin, from their poverty which compelled them to seek fortunes at foreign courts by the exercise of a popular art, from the success of their bards, the nature of their republican government, or their habits of unsettled life, were more given to verse than any other Gothic, or even Celtic, tribe. But this is not all: they re∣mained pagans, and retained their original manners, much longer than any of their Gothic kindred. They were not completely converted to christianity till the tenth century <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See bishop Lloyd's Hist. Account of Church Government in Great Britain, &amp;c. chap. i. §. 11. pag. 4to. Lond. 1684. And Crymog. Arngrim. L. i. cap. 10. p. 104.</NOTE>. Hence, under the concurrence however of some of the causes just mentioned, their scaldic profession acquired greater degrees of strength and of maturity: and from an uninterrupted pos∣session through many ages of the most romantic religious superstitions, and the preservation of those rough manners which are so favourable to the poetical spirit, was enabled to produce, not only more genuine, but more numerous, compo∣sitions. True religion would have checked the impetuosity of their passions, suppressed their wild exertions of fancy, and banished that striking train of imagery, which their
<PB REF="56"/>
poetry derived from a barbarous theology. This circum∣stance also suggests to our consideration, those superior advantages and opportunities arising from leisure and length of time, which they enjoyed above others, of circulating their poetry far and wide, of giving a general currency to their mode of fabling, of rendering their skill in versifica∣tion more universally and familiarly known, and a more conspicuous and popular object of admiration or imitation to the neighbouring countries. Hence too it has happened, that modern times have not only attained much fuller information concerning their historical transactions, but are so intimately acquainted with the peculiarities of their character.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the Danish invasions produced a con∣siderable alteration in the manners of our Anglo-Saxon an∣cestors. Although their connections with England were transient and interrupted, and on the whole scarcely lasted two hundred years, yet many of the Danish customs began to prevail among the inhabitants, which seem to have given a new turn to their temper and genius. The Danish fashion of excessive drinking, for instance, a vice almost natural to the northern nations, became so general among the Anglo-Saxons, that it was found necessary to restrain so pernicious and contagious a practice by a particular statute <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Lambarde's Archaionom. And Bartholin. ii. c. xii. p. 542.</NOTE>. Hence it seems likely, that so popular an entertainment as their poetry gained ground; especially if we consider, that in their expeditions against England they were of course attended by many northern scalds, who constantly made a part of their military retinue, and whose language was understood by the Saxons. Rogwald, lord of the Orcades, who was also himself a poet, going on an expedition into Palestine, carried with him two Islandic bards <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><SUP>g</SUP> Ol. Worm. Lit.

<Q><P>"The goddesses who preside over battles come, sent forth by Odin. They go to chuse among the princes of the illustrious race of Yngvon a man who is to perish, and to go to dwell in the palace of the gods."</P>
<P>"Gondola leaned on the end of her lance, and thus bespoke her companions. The assembly of the gods is going to be increased: the gods invite Hacon, with his numerous host, to enter the palace of Odin."</P>
<P>"Thus spake these glorious nymphs of war: who were seated on their horses, who were covered with their shields and helmets, and appeared full of some great thought."</P>
<P>"Hacon heard their discourse. Why, said he, why hast thou thus disposed of the battle? Were we not worthy to have obtained of the gods a more perfect vic∣tory? It is we, she replied, who have given it thee. It is we who have put thine enemies to flight."</P>

<P>"At length king Hacon approaches; and arriving from the battle is still all be∣sprinkled and running down with blood. At the sight of Odin he cries out, Ah! how severe and terrible does this god appear to me!"</P>
<P>"The hero Brago replies, Come, thou that wast the terror of the bravest war∣riors: Come hither, and rejoin thine eight brothers: the heroes who reside here shall live with thee in peace: Go, drink Ale in the circle of heroes."</P>

An action is carried on by a set of the most aweful ideal personages, finely imagined. The goddesses of battle, Odin, his sons Hermode and Brago, and the spectre of the deceased king, are all in∣troduced, speaking and acting as in a drama. The panegyric is nobly conducted, and arises out of the sublimity of the fiction.</P></NOTE>, king of Norway, was composed on a battle in which that prince, with eight of his brothers fell, by the scald Eyvynd; who for his superior skill in poetry was called the CROSS of POETS, and fought in the battle which he celebrated. Hacon earl of Norway was accompanied by five celebrated bards in the battle of Jomsburgh: and we are told, that each of them sung an ode to animate the soldiers before the en∣gagement began <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. p. 172.</NOTE>. They appear to have been regularly brought into action. Olave, a king of Norway, when his army was prepared for the onset, placed three scalds about
<PB REF="58"/>
him, and exclaimed aloud, <Q REND="inline">"You shall not only record in your verses what you have HEARD, but what you have SEEN."</Q> They each delivered an ode on the spot <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Olaf. Sag. apud Verel. ad HERV. SAG. p. 178. Bartholin. p. 172.</NOTE>. These northern chiefs appear to have so frequently hazarded their lives with such amazing intrepidity, merely in expecta∣tion of meriting a panegyric from their poets, the judges, and the spectators of their gallant behaviour. That scalds were common in the Danish armies when they invaded England, appears from a stratagem of Alfred; who, availing himself of his skill in oral poetry and playing on the harp, entered the Danish camp habited in that character, and procured a hospitable reception. This was in the year 878 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ingulph: Hist. p. 869. Malmesb. ii. c. 4. p. 43.</NOTE>. Anlaff, a Danish king, used the same disguise for re∣connoitring the camp of our Saxon monarch Athelstan: tak∣ing his station near Athelstan's pavilion, he entertained the king and his chiefs with his verses and music, and was dis∣missed with an honourable reward <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Malmesb. ii. 6. I am aware, that the truth of both these anecdotes respecting Alfred and Anlaff has been controverted. But no sufficient argument has yet been of∣fered for pronouncing them spurious, or even suspicious. See an ingenious Disserta∣tion in the ARCHAEOLOGIA, vol. ii. p. 100. seq. A. D. 1773. 4to.</NOTE>. As Anlaff's dialect must have discovered him to have been a Dane; here is a proof, of what I shall bring more, that the Saxons, even in the midst of mutual hostilities, treated the Danish scalds with favour and respect. That the Islandic bards were com∣mon in England during the Danish invasions, there are numerous proofs. Egill, a celebrated Islandic poet, having murthered the son and many of the friends of Eric Blodoxe, king of Denmark or Norway, then residing in Northum∣berland, and which he had just conquered, procured a pardon by singing before the king, at the command of his queen Gunhilde, an extemporaneous ode <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Crymogr. Angrim. Jon. Lib. ii. pag. 125 edit. 1609.</NOTE>. Egill compliments the king, who probably was his patron, with the appellation of the
<PB REF="59"/>
English chief. <Q REND="inline">"I offer my freight to the king. I owe a poem for my ransom. I present to the ENGLISH CHIEF the mead of Odin <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Ol. Worm. Lit. Run. p. 227. 195. All the chiefs of Eric were also present at the recital of this ode, which is in a noble strain.</NOTE>."</Q> Afterwards he calls this Danish conqueror the commander of the Scottish fleet. <Q REND="inline">"The com∣mander of the Scottish fleet fattened the ravenous birds. The sister of Nera [Death] trampled on the foe: she trampled on the evening food of the eagle."</Q> The Scots usually joined the Danish or Norwegian invaders in their attempts on the northern parts of Britain <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See the Saxon epinicion in praise of king Athelstan. supr. citat. Hen. Hunting. L. v. p. 203. 204.</NOTE>: and from this circumstance a new argument arises, to shew the close com∣munication and alliance which must have subsisted between Scotland and Scandinavia. Egill, although of the enemy's party, was a singular favourite of king Athelstan. Athelstan once asked Egill how he escaped due punishment from Eric Blodoxe, the king of Northumberland, for the very capital and enormous crime which I have just mentioned. On which Egill immediately related the whole of that transaction to the Saxon king, in a sublime ode still extant <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Torfaeus Hist. Orcad. Praefat. <Q REND="inline">"Rei statim ordinem metro nunc satis obscuro exposuit."</Q> Torfaeus adds, which is much to our purpose, <Q REND="inline">"nequaquam ita narraturus NON INTELLIGENTI."</Q></NOTE>. On another occasion Athelstan presented Egill with two rings, and two large cabinets filled with silver; promising at the same time, to grant him any gift or favour which he should chuse to request. Egill, struck with gratitude, immediately composed a panegyrical poem in the Norwegian language, then com∣mon to both nations, on the virtues of Athelstan, which the latter as generously requited with two marcs of pure gold <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Crymog. Arn. Jon. p. 129. ut supr.</NOTE>. Here is likewise another argument that the Saxons had no small esteem for the scaldic poetry. It is highly rea∣sonable to conjecture, that our Danish king Canute; a po∣tentate of most extensive jurisdiction, and not only king of
<PB REF="60"/>
England, but of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, was not without the customary retinue of the northern courts, in which the scalds held so distinguished and important a sta∣tion. Human nature, in a savage state, aspires to some species of merit; and in every stage of society is alike suscep∣tible of flattery, when addressed to the reigning passion. The sole object of these northern princes was military glory. It is certain that Canute delighted in this mode of entertain∣ment, which he patronised and liberally rewarded. It is related in KNYTLINGA-SAGA, or Canute's History, that he commanded the scald Loftunga to be put to death, for daring to comprehend his atchievements in too concise a poem. <Q REND="inline">"Nemo, said he, ante te, ausus est de me BREVES CANTILENAS componere."</Q> A curious picture of the tyrant, the patron, and the barbarian, united! But the bard extorted a speedy pardon, and with much address, by producing the next day before the king at dinner an ode of more than thirty strophes, for which Canute gave him fifty marcs of purified silver <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. Antiquit. Danic. Lib. i. cap. 10. p. 169. 170. See KNYTLINGA SAGA, in Catal. Codd. MSS. Bibl. Holm. Hickes. Thesaur. ii. 312.</NOTE>. In the mean time, the Danish language began to grow perfectly familiar in England. It was eagerly learned by the Saxon clergy and nobility, from a principle of ingratiating themselves with Canute: and there are many manuscripts now remaining, by which it will appear, that the Danish runes were much studied among our Saxon ancestors, under the reign of that monarch <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hickes, ubi supr. i. 134. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The songs of the Irish bards are by some conceived to be strongly marked with the traces of scaldic imagination; and these traces, which will be reconsidered, are believed still to survive among a species of poetical historians, whom they call TALE-TELLERS, supposed to be the descendants of the original Irish bards <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><P>We are informed by the Irish histo∣rians, that saint Patrick, when he converted Ireland to the Christian faith, destroyed three hundred volumes of the songs of the Irish bards. Such was their dignity in this country, that they were permitted to wear a robe of the same colour with that of the royal family. They were constantly sum∣moned to a triennial festival: and the most approved songs delivered at this assembly were ordered to be preserved in the custody of the king's historian or antiquary. Many of these compositions are referred to by Keating, as the foundation of his history of Ireland. Ample estates were appro∣priated to them, that they might live in a condition of independence and ease. The profession was hereditary: but when a bard died, his estate devolved not to his eldest son, but to such of his family as discovered the most distinguished talents for poetry and music. Every principal bard retained thirty of inferior note, as his attendants; and a bard of the secondary class was fol∣lowed by a retinue of fifteen. They seem to have been at their height in the year 558. See Keating's History of Ireland, p. 127. 132. 370. 380. And Pref. p. 23. None of their poems have been translated.</P>
<P>There is an article in the LAWS of Ke∣neth king of Scotland, promulged in the year 850, which places the bards of Scot∣land, who certainly were held in equal esteem with those of the neighbouring countries, in the lowest station. <Q REND="inline">"Fugi∣tivos, BARDOS, otio addictos, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urras et hujusmodi hominum genus, loris et fla∣gris caedunto."</Q> <BIBL>Apud Hector.

Temple's Essays, part iv. p. 349.</NOTE>."</Q> These are topics in which the Runic poetry is said to have been greatly conversant.</P>
<P>Nor is it improbable that the Welsh bards <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>The bards of Britain were originally a constitutional appendage of the druidical hierarchy. In the parish of Llanidan in the isle of Anglesey, there are still to be seen the ruins of an arch-druid's mansion, which they call TRER DREW, that is the DRUID'S MANSION. Near it are marks of the habitations of the separate conven∣tual societies, which were under his imme∣diate orders and inspection. Among these is TRER BEIRD, or, as they call it to this day, the HAMLET OF THE BARDS. Row∣lands's MONA, p. 83. 88. But so strong was the attachment of the Celtic nations, among which we reckon Britain, to poetry, that, amidst all the changes of government and manners, even long after the order of Druids was extinct, and the national reli∣gion altered, the bards, acquiring a sort of civil capacity, and a new establish∣ment, still continued to flourish. And with regard to Britain, the bards flourished most in those parts of it, which most strongly retained their native Celtic character. The Britons living in those countries that were between the Trent or Humber and the Thames, by far the greatest portion of this island, in the midst of the Roman garrisons and colonies, had been so long inured to the customs of the Romans, that they pre∣served very little of the British; and from this long and habitual intercourse, before the fifth century, they seem to have lost their original language. We cannot dis∣cover the slightest trace, in the poems of the bards, the LIVES of the British saints, or any other antient monument, that they held any correspondence with the Welsh, the Cornish, the Cumbrian, or the Strath∣cluyd Britons. Among other British insti∣tutions grown obsolete among them, they seem to have lost the use of Bards; at least there are no memorials of any they had, nor any of their songs remaining: nor do the Welsh or Cumbrian poets ever touch upon any transactions that passed in those countries, after they were relinquished by the Romans.</P>
<P>And here we see the reason why the Welsh bards flourished so much and so long. But moreover the Welsh, kept in awe as they were by the Romans, harrassed by the Saxons, and eternally jealous of the attacks, the encroachments, and the neigh∣bourhood of aliens, were on this account attached to their Celtic manners: this situa∣tion, and these circumstances, inspired them with a pride and an obstinacy for man∣taining a national distinction, and for pre∣serving their antient usages, among which the bardic profession is so eminent.</P></NOTE> might have been acquainted with the Scandinavian scalds. I mean before
<PB REF="62"/>
their communications with Armorica, mentioned at large above. The prosody of the Welsh bards depended much on alliteration <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See infr. SECT. x. p. 32.</NOTE>. Hence they seem to have paid an at∣tention to the scaldic versification. The Islandic poets are said to have carried alliteration to the highest pitch of exact∣ness in their earliest periods: whereas the Welsh bards of the sixth century used it but sparingly, and in a very imper∣fect degree. In this circumstance a proof of imitation, at least of emulation, is implied <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I am however informed by a very in∣telligent antiquary in British literature, that there are manifest marks of alliteration in some druidical fragments still remaining, undoubtedly composed before the Britons could have possibly mixed in the smallest degree with any Gothic nation. Rhyme is likewise found in the British poetry at the earliest period, in those druidical triplets called ENGLYN MILWR, or the WAR∣RIOR'S SONG, in which every verse is closed with a consonant syllable. See a metrical Druid oracle in Borlase's Antiquit. Cornwall. B. iii. ch. 5. p. 185. edit. 1769.</NOTE>. There are moreover, strong instances of conformity between the manners of the two nations; which, however, may be accounted for on general principles arising from our comparative observations on rude life. Yet it is remarkable that mead, the northern nectar, or favourite liquor of the Goths <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">And of the antient Franks. Gregory of Tours mentions a Frank drinking this liquor; and adds, that he acquired this habit from the BARBAROUS or Frankish nations. Hist. Franc. lib. viii. c. 33. p. 404. ed. 1699.

On the three feast days he is to have the steward's robe for a fee. He is to attend, if the queen desires a song in her chamber. An ox or cow is to be given out of the booty or prey (chiefly consisting of cattle) taken from the English by the king's dome∣stics: and while the prey is dividing, he is to sing the praises of the BRITISH KINGS or KINGDOM.

<P>The caliphs, and other eastern potentates, had their bards: whom they treated with equal respect. Sir John Maundeville, who travelled in 1340, says, that when the em∣peror of Cathay, or great Cham of Tar∣tary, is seated at dinner in high pomp with his lords, <Q REND="inline">"no man is so hardi to speak to him except it be MUSICIANS <HI>to solace the emperour.</HI>"</Q> <BIBL>chap. lxvii. p. 100.</BIBL> Here is another proof of the correspon∣dence between the eastern and northern customs: and this instance might be brought as an argument of the bardic institution being fetched from the east. Leo Afer mentions the <HI>Poetae curiae</HI> of the Caliph's court at Bag∣dad, about the year 990. De Med. et Philos. Arab. cap. iv. Those poets were in most repute among the Arabians, who could speak extemporaneous verses to the Caliph. Euseb. Renaudot. apud Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xiii. p. 249. Thomson, in the CASTLE of INDOLENCE, mentions the BARD IN WAITING being introduced to lull the Caliph asleep. And Maundeville men∣tions MINSTRELLES as established officers in the court of the emperor of Cathay.</P></NOTE>. Nor must I pass over, what reflects much light on this reasoning, that the establishment of the houshold of the old Irish chiefs, exactly resembles that of the Welsh kings. For, besides the bard, the musician, and the smith, they have both a physician, a huntsman, and other corresponding officers <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Temple, ubi supr. p. 346.</NOTE>. We must also remember, that an intercourse was necessarily produced between the Welsh and Scandinavians, from the piratical irruptions of the latter: their scalds, as I have already remarked, were respected and patronised in the courts of those princes, whose territories were the prin∣cipal objects of the Danish invasions. Torfaeus expressly affirms this of the Anglo-Saxon and Irish kings; and it is
<PB REF="66"/>
at least probable, that they were entertained with equal re∣gard by the Welsh princes, who so frequently concurred with the Danes in distressing the English. It may be added, that the Welsh, although living in a separate and detached situation, and so strongly prejudiced in favour of their own usages, yet from neighbourhood, and unavoidable communications of various kinds, might have imbibed the ideas of the Scandinavian bards from the Saxons and Danes, after those nations had occupied and overspread all the other parts of our island.</P>
<P>Many pieces of the Scottish bards are still remaining in the high-lands of Scotland. Of these a curious specimen, and which considered in a more extensive and general respect, is a valuable monument of the poetry of a rude period, has lately been given to the world, under the title of the WORKS OF OSSIAN. It is indeed very remarkable, that in these poems, the terrible graces, which so naturally characterise, and so generally constitute, the early poetry of a barbarous people, should so frequently give place to a gentler set of manners, to the social sensibilities of polished life, and a more civilised and elegant species of imagination. Nor is this circumstance, which disarranges all our established ideas concerning the savage stages of society, easily to be accounted for, unless we suppose, that the Celtic tribes, who were so strongly addicted to poetical composition, and who made it so much their study from the earliest times, might by de∣grees have attained a higher vein of poetical refinement, than could at first sight or on common principles be expected among nations, whom we are accustomed to call barbarous; that some few instances of an elevated strain of friendship, of love, and other sentimental feelings, ex∣isting in such nations, might lay the foundation for intro∣ducing a set of manners among the bards, more refined and exalted than the real manners of the country: and that panegyrics on those virtues, transmitted with improvements
<PB REF="67"/>
from bard to bard, must at length have formed characters of ideal excellence, which might propagate among the peo∣ple real manners bordering on the poetical. These poems, however, notwithstanding the difference between the Gothic and the Celtic rituals, contain many visible vestiges of Scan∣dinavian superstition. The allusions in the songs of Ossian to spirits, who preside over the different parts and direct the various operations of nature, who send storms over the deep, and rejoice in the shrieks of the shipwrecked mariner, who call down lightning to blast the forest or cleave the rock, and diffuse irresistible pestilence among the people, beautifully conducted indeed, and heightened, under the skilful hand of a master bard, entirely correspond with the Runic system, and breathe the spirit of its poetry. One fiction in particular, the most EXTRAVAGANT in all Ossian's poems, is founded on an essential article of the Runic belief. It is where Fingal fights with the spirit of Loda. Nothing could aggrandise Fingal's heroism more highly than this marvellous encounter. It was esteemed among the antient Danes the most daring act of courage to engage with a ghost <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. De Contemptu Mortis apud Dan. L. ii. c. 2. p. 258. And ibid. p. 260. There are many other marks of Gothic customs and superstitions in Ossian. The fashion of marking the sepulchres of their chiefs with circles of stones, cor∣responds with what Olaus Wormius relates of the Danes. Monum. Danic. Hafn. 1634. p. 38. See also Ol. Magn. Hist. xvi. 2. In the HERVARER SAGA, the sword of Suarfulama is forged by the dwarfs, and called Tirsing. Hickes, vol. i. p. 193. So Fingal's sword was made by an enchanter, and was called the SON of LUNO. And, what is more, this Luno was the Vulcan of the north, lived in Juteland, and made complete suits of armour for many of the Scandinavian heroes. See TEMORA, B. vii. p. 159. OSSIAN, vol. ii. edit. 1765. Hence the bards of both countries made him a celebrated enchanter. By the way, the names of sword-smiths were thought worthy to be recorded in history.

<P>We must be careful to distinguish be∣tween the poetry of the Scandinavians, the Teutonics, and the Celts.

But I must ex∣cept the poems of Ossian, which are noble and genuine remains of the Celtic poetry.</P></NOTE>.
<PB REF="69"/>
But we are not informed whether these were Scandinavian, Celtic, or Teutonic poems.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the tenth century, France was invaded by the Normans, or NORTHERN-MEN, an army of adventurers from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. And although the conquerors, especially when their success does not solely depend on superiority of numbers, usually assume
<PB REF="70"/>
the manners of the conquered, yet these strangers must have still further familiarised in France many of their northern fictions.</P>
<P>From this general circulation in these and other countries, and from that popularity which it is natural to suppose they must have acquired, the scaldic inventions might have taken deep root in Europe <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Of the long continuance of the Celtic superstitions in the popular belief, see what is said in the most elegant and judicious piece of criticism which the present age has produced, Mrs. Montague's ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE. p. 145. edit. 1772.</NOTE>. At least they seem to have prepared the way for the more easy admission of the Arabian fabling about the ninth century, by which they were, however, in great measure, superseded. The Arabian fictions were of a more splendid nature, and better adapted to the increasing civility of the times. Less horrible and gross, they had a novelty, a variety, and a magnificence, which carried with them the charm of fascination. Yet it is probable, that many of the scaldic imaginations might have been blended with the Arabian. In the mean time, there is great reason to believe, that the Gothic scalds enriched their vein of fabling from this new and fruitful source of fiction, opened by the Arabians in Spain, and afterwards propagated by the crusades. It was in many respects cogenial with their own <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Besides the general wildness of the imagery in both, among other particular circumstances of coincidence which might be mentioned here, the practice of giving names to swords, which we find in the scaldic poems, occurs also among the Arabians. In the HERVARER SAGA, the sword of Suar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulama is called TIRFING. Hickes. Thes. i. p. 193. The names of swords of many of the old northern chiefs are given us by Olaus Wormius, Lit Run. cap. xix. p. 110. 4to. ed. Thus, Herbe∣lot recites a long catalogue of the names of the swords of the most famous Arabian and Persic warriors. V. SAIF. p. 736. b. Mahomet had nine swords, all which are named. As were also his bows, quivers, cui∣rasses, helmets, and lances. His swords were called <HI>The Piercing, Ruin, Death,</HI> &amp;c. Mod. Univ. Hist. i. p. 253. This is com∣mon in the romance-writers and Ariosto. Mahomet's horses had also pompous or heroic appellations. Such as the <HI>Swift, The Thunderer, Shaking the earth with his hoof, The Red,</HI> &amp;c. As likewise his mules, asses, and camels. Horses were named in this manner among the Runic heroes. See Ol. Worm. ut supr. p. 110. Odin's horse was called SLEIPNER. See EDDA Island. fab. xxi. I could give other proofs. But we have already wandered too far, in what Spenser calls, <HI>this delightfull londe of Faerie.</HI> Yet I must add, that from one, or both, of these sources, king Arthur's sword is named in Geoffrey of Monmouth, Lib. ix. cap. 11. Ron is also the name of his lance. ibid. cap. 4. And Turpin calls Charlemagne's sword <HI>Gau∣diosa.</HI> See Obs. Spens. i. §. vi. p. 214. By the way, from these correspondencies, an argument might be drawn, to prove the oriental origin of the Goths. And some perhaps may think them proofs of the doctrine just now suggested in the text, that the scalds borrowed from the Arabians.</NOTE>: and the northern bards, who visited the countries
<PB REF="71"/>
where these new fancies were spreading, must have been naturally struck with such wonders, and were certainly fond of picking up fresh embellishments, and new strokes of the marvellous, for augmenting and improving their stock of poetry. The earliest scald now on record is not before the year 750. From which time the scalds flourished in the northern countries, till below the year 1157 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ol. Worm. Lit.

It is not likely that these pieces, to say no more, were composed till the Scandinavian tribes had been converted to christianity; that is, as I have before observed, about the close of the tenth century.

It has, however, been urged, that as the irruption of the Normans into France, under their leader Rollo, did not take place till towards the beginning of the tenth century, at which period the scaldic art was arrived to the highest perfection in Rollo's native country, we can easily trace the descent of the French and English romances of chivalry from the Northern Sagas. It is supposed, that Rollo carried with him many scalds from the north, who transmitted their skill to their children and successors: and that these, adopting the religion, opinions, and language, of the new country, substituted the heroes of christendom, instead of those of their pagan ancestors, and began to celebrate the feats of Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver, whose true history they set off and embellished with the scaldic figments of dwarfs, giants, dragons, and inchantments <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Percy's Ess. Metr. Rom. p. viii.</NOTE>. There is, however, some reason to believe, that these fictions were current among the French long before; and, if the principles advanced in the former part of this dissertation be true, the fables adhering to Charlemagne's real history must be referred to another source.</P>
<P>Let me add, that the inchantments of the Runic poetry are very different from those in our romances of chivalry. The former chiefly deal in spells and charms, such as would preserve from poison, blunt the weapons of an enemy, pro∣cure victory, allay a tempest, cure bodily diseases, or call the dead from their tombs: in uttering a form of mysterious words, or inscribing Runic characters. The magicians of romance are chiefly employed in forming and conducting a train of deceptions. There is an air of barbaric horror in the
<PB REF="75"/>
incantations of the scaldic fablers: the magicians of romance often present visions of pleasure and delight; and, although not without their alarming terrors, sometimes lead us through flowery forests, and raise up palaces glittering with gold and precious stones. The Runic magic is more like that of Canidia in Horace, the romantic resembles that of Armida in Tasso. The operations of the one are frequently but mere tricks, in comparison of that sublime solemnity of necromantic machinery which the other so awefully displays.</P>
<P>It is also remarkable, that in the earlier scaldic odes, we find but few dragons, giants, and fairies. These were intro∣duced afterwards, and are the progeny of Arabian fancy. Nor indeed do these imaginary beings often occur in any of the compositions which preceded the introduction of that species of fabling. On this reasoning, the Irish tale-teller mentioned above, could not be a lineal descendant of the elder Irish bards. The absence of giants and dragons, and, let me add, of many other traces of that fantastic and bril∣liant imagery which composes the system of Arabian ima∣gination, from the poems of Ossian, are a striking proof of their antiquity. It has already been suggested, at what period, and from what origin, those fancies got footing in the Welsh poetry: we do not find them in the odes of Taliessin or Aneurin <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Who flourished about the year 570. He has left a long spirited poem called GO∣DODIN, often alluded to by the later Welsh bards, which celebrates a battle fought against the Saxons near Cattraeth, under the conduct of Mynnydawe Eiddin, in which all the Britons, three only ex∣cepted, among which was the bard Aneurin himself, were slain. I will give a specimen. <Q REND="inline">"The men whose drink was mead, comely in shape, hastened to Cattraeth. These impetuous warriors in ranks, armed with red spears, long and bending, began the battle. Might I speak my revenge against the people of the Deiri, I would overwhelm them, like a deluge, in one slaughter: for unheeding I have lost a friend, who was brave in resisting his enemies. I drank of the wine and metheglin of Mordai, whose spear was of huge size. In the shock of the battle, he prepared food for the eagle. When Cydwal hastened forward, a shout arose: before the yellow morning, when he gave the signal, he broke the shield into small splinters. The men hastened to Cattraeth, noble in birth: their drink was wine and mead, out of golden cups. There were three hundred and sixty three adorned with chains of gold; but of those, who filled with wine, rushed on to the fight, only three escaped, who hewed their way with the sword, the warrior of Acron, Conan Dacarawd, and I the bard Aneurin, red with blood, otherwise I should not have survived to compose this song. When Caradoc hastened to the war, he was the son of a wild boar, in hewing down the Saxons; a bull in the conflict of fight, he twisted the wood [spear] from their hands. Gurien saw not his father after he had lifted the glistening mead in his hand. I praise all the warriors who thus met in the battle, and attacked the foe with one mind. Their life was short, but they have left a long regret to their friends. Yet of the Saxons they slew more than seven ..... There was many a mo∣ther shedding tears. The song is due to thee who hast attained the highest glory: thou who wast like fire, thunder and storm: O Rudd Fedell, warlike champion, excellent in might, you still think of the war. The noble chiefs deserve to be celebrated in verse, who after the fight made the rivers to over∣flow their banks with blood. Their hands glutted the throats of the dark∣brown eagles, and skilfully prepared food for the ravenous birds. Of all the chiefs who went to Cattraeth with golden chains,"</Q> &amp;c. This poem is extremely difficult to be understood, being written, if not in the Pictish language, at least in a dialect of the Britons very different from the modern Welsh. See the learned and ingenious Mr. Evans's DISSERTATIO DE BARDIS, p. 68.—75.</NOTE>. This reasoning explains an observation
<PB REF="76"/>
of an ingenious critic in this species of literature, and who has studied the works of the Welsh bards with much attention. <Q REND="inline">"There are not such extravagant FLIGHTS in any poetic compositions, except it be in the EASTERN; to which, as far as I can judge by the few translated speci∣mens I have seen, they <HI>bear a near resemblance</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Evans, ubi supr.

is found in the compositions of the Welsh bards only, who flourished after the native vein of British fabling had been tinctured by these FAIRY TALES, which the Arabians had propagated in Armorica, and which the Welsh had received from their connection with that province of Gaul. Such a fiction as this is entirely different from the cast and com∣plection of the ideas of the original Welsh poets. It is easy to collect from the Welsh odes, written after the tenth century, many signatures of this EXOTIC imagery. Such as, <Q REND="inline">"Their assault was like strong lions. He is valourous as a lion, who can resist his lance? The dragon of Mona's sons were so brave in fight, that there was horrible con∣sternation, and upon Tal Moelvre a thousand banners.

In a word, not only that elevation of allusion, which many suppose to be peculiar to the poetry of Wales, but that fertility of fiction, and those marvellous fables recorded in Geoffrey of Monmouth, which the generality of readers, who do not sufficiently attend to the origin of that historian's ro∣mantic materials, believe to be the genuine offspring of the Welsh poets, are of foreign growth. And, to return to the ground of this argument, there is the strongest reason to suspect, that even the Gothic EDDA, or system of poetic mythology of the northern nations, is enriched with those higher strokes of oriental imagination, which the Arabians had communicated to the Europeans. Into this extravagant tissue of unmeaning allegory, false philosophy, and false theology, it was easy to incorporate their most wild and romantic conceptions <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><P>Huet is of opinion, that the EDDA is entirely the production of Snorro's fancy. But this is saying too much. See Orig. Roman. p. 116. The first Edda was com∣piled, undoubtedly with many additions and interpolations, from fictions and tra∣ditions in the old Runic poems, by Soe∣mund Sigfusson, surnamed the Learned, about the year 1057. He seems to have made it his business to select or digest into one body such of these pieces as were best calculated to furnish a collection of poetic phrases and figures. He studied in Ger∣many, and chiefly at Cologne. This first Edda, being not only prolix, but perplexed and obscure, a second, which is that now extant, was compiled by Snorro Sturleson, born in the year 1179.</P>
<P>It is certain, and very observable, that in the EDDA we find much more of giants, dragons, and other imaginary be∣ings, undoubtedly belonging to Arabian romance, then in the earlier Scaldic odes. By the way, there are many strokes in both the EDDAS taken from the REVEL ATIONS of Saint John, which must come from the compilers who were Christ ians.</P></NOTE>.</P>

It must be confessed, that the ideas of chivalry, the appen∣dage and the subject of romance, subsisted among the Goths. But this must be understood under certain limitations. There is no peculiarity which more strongly discriminates the manners of the Greeks and Romans from those of modern times, than that small degree of attention and re∣spect with which those nations treated the fair sex, and that inconsiderable share which they were permitted to take in conversation, and the general commerce of life. For the truth of this observation, we need only appeal to the classic writers: in which their women appear to have been devoted to a state of seclusion and obscurity. One is surprised that barbarians should be greater masters of complaisance than the most polished people that ever existed. No sooner was the Roman empire overthrown, and the Goths had over∣powered Europe, than we find the female character assuming an unusual importance and authority, and distinguished with new privileges, in all the European governments established by the northern conquerors. Even amidst the confusions of savage war, and among the almost incredible enormities committed by the Goths at their invasion of the empire, they forbore to offer any violence to the women. This perhaps is one of the most striking features in the new state of manners, which took place about the seventh century: and it is to this period, and to this people, that we must refer the origin of gallantry in Europe. The Romans never intro∣duced these sentiments into their European provinces.</P>
<P><PB REF="80"/>
The Goths believed some divine and prophetic quality to be inherent in their women; they admitted them into their coun∣cils, and consulted them on the public business of the state. They were suffered to conduct the great events which they predicted. Ganna, a prophetic virgin of the Marcomanni, a German or Gaulish tribe, was sent by her nation to Rome, and admitted into the presence of Domitian, to treat con∣cerning terms of peace <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dio. lib. lxvii. p. 761.</NOTE>. Tacitus relates, that Velleda, another German prophetess, held frequent conferences with the Roman generals; and that on some occasions, on account of the sacredness of her person, she was placed at a great distance on a high tower, from whence, like an oracular divinity, she conveyed her answers by some chosen messenger <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hist. lib. iv. p. 953. edit.

Germ. pag. 972. ut supr.</NOTE>. From these circumstances, the women even claimed a sort of precedence, at least an equality subsisted between the sexes, in the Gothic constitutions.</P>
<P>But the deference paid to the fair sex, which produced the spirit of gallantry, is chiefly to be sought for in those strong and exaggerated ideas of female chastity which prevailed among the northern nations. Hence the lover's devotion to his mistress was encreased, his attentions to her service multiplied, his affection heightened, and his sollicitude ag∣gravated, in proportion as the difficulty of obtaining her was enhanced: and the passion of love acquired a degree of delicacy, when controlled by the principles of honour and purity. The highest excellence of character then known was a superiority in arms; and that rival was most likely to gain his lady's regard, who was the bravest champion. Here we see valour inspired by love. In the mean time, the same heroic spirit which was the surest claim to the favour of the ladies, was often exerted in their protection: a protection much wanted in an age of rapine, of plunder, and piracy; when the weakness of the softer sex was exposed to conti∣nual dangers and unexpected attacks <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See instances of this sort of violence in the antient HISTORY of HIALMAR, a Runic romance, p. 135. 136. 140. Diss. Epist. Ad calc. Hickes. Thesaur. vol. i. Where also is a challenge between two champions for king Hialmar's daughter. But the king composes the quarrel by giv∣ing to one of them, named Ulfo, among other rich presents, an inestimable horn, on which were inlaid in gold the images of Odin, Thor, and Freya: and to the other, named Hramur, the lady herself, and a drum, embossed with golden imagery, which foretold future events. This piece, which is in Runic capital characters, was written before the year 1000. Many sto∣ries of this kind might be produced from the northern chronicles.</NOTE>. It is easy to sup∣pose the officious emulation and ardour of many a gallant young warrior, pressing forward to be foremost in this ho∣nourable service, which flattered the most agreeable of all passions, and which gratified every enthusiasm of the times,
<PB REF="82"/>
especially the fashionable fondness for a wandering and mili∣tary life. In the mean time, we may conceive the lady thus won, or thus defended, conscious of her own importance, affecting an air of stateliness: it was her pride to have pre∣served her chastity inviolate, she could perceive no merit but that of invincible bravery, and could only be approached in terms of respect and submission.</P>
<P>Among the Scandinavians, a people so fond of cloathing adventures in verse, these gallantries must naturally become the subject of poetry, with its fictitious embellishments. Accordingly, we find their chivalry displayed in their odes; pieces, which at the same time greatly confirm these obser∣vations. The famous ode of Regner Lodbrog, affords a striking instance; in which, being imprisoned in a loath∣some dungeon, and condemned to be destroyed by venomous serpents, he solaces his desperate situation by recollecting and reciting the glorious exploits of his past life. One of these, and the first which he commemorates, was an at∣chievement of chivalry. It was the delivery of a beautiful Swedish princess from an impregnable fortress, in which she was forcibly detained by one of her father's captains. Her father issued a proclamation, promising that whoever would rescue the lady, should have her in marriage. Regner suc∣ceeded in the attempt, and married the fair captive. This was about the year 860 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See Torf. Hist. Norw. tom. i. lib. 10. Saxo Grammat. p. 152. And Ol. Worm. Lit. Rom. p. 221. edit. 4. I suspect that the romantic amour between Regner and Aslauga is the forgery of a much later age See REGNARA LODBROG'S Saga. C. 5. apud Biorneri Histor. Reg. Her. et Pugil. Res. praeclar. gest. Stockholm. 1737.</NOTE>. There are other strokes in Reg∣ner's ode, which, although not belonging to this particular story, deserve to be pointed out here, as illustrative of our argument. Such as, <Q REND="inline">"It was like being placed near a beau∣tiful virgin on a couch.—It was like kissing a young widow in the first seat at a feast. I made to struggle in the twilight that golden-haired chief, who passed his mornings among the young maidens, and loved to converse with
<PB REF="83"/>
widows.—He who aspires to the love of young virgins, ought always to be foremost in the din of arms <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">St.. 13. 14. 19. 23.</NOTE>."</Q> It is worthy of remark, that these sentiments occur to Regner while he is in the midst of his tortures, and at the point of death. Thus many of the heroes in Froissart, in the greatest extremities of danger, recollect their amours, and die think∣ing of their mistresses. And by the way, in the same strain, Boh, a Danish champion, having lost his chin, and one of his cheeks, by a single stroke from Thurstain Midlang, only re∣flected how he should be received, when thus maimed and disfigured, by the Danish girls. He instantly exclaimed in a tone of savage gallantry, <Q REND="inline">"The Danish virgins will not now willingly or easily give me kisses, if I should perhaps return home <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chron. Norveg. p. 136.</NOTE>."</Q> But there is an ode, in the KNYTLINGA-SAGA, written by Harald the VALIANT, which is professedly a song of chivalry; and which; exclusive of its wild spirit of ad∣venture, and its images of savage life, has the romantic air of a set of stanzas, composed by a Provencial troubadour. Harald, appears to have been one of the most eminent ad∣venturers of his age. He had killed the king of Drontheim in a bloody engagement. He had traversed all the seas, and visited all the coasts, of the north; and had carried his pira∣tical enterprises even as far as the Mediterranean, and the shores of Africa. He was at length taken prisoner, and de∣tained for some time at Constantinople. He complains in this ode, that the reputation he had acquired by so many hazardous exploits, by his skill in single combat, riding, swimming, gliding along the ice, darting, rowing, and guiding a ship through the rocks, had not been able to make any impression on Elissiff, or Elisabeth, the beautiful daughter of Jarilas, king of Russia <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bartholin. p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Here, however, chivalry subsisted but in its rudiments. Under the feudal establishments, which were soon afterwards erected in Europe, it received new vigour, and was invested
<PB REF="84"/>
with the formalities of a regular institution. The nature and circumstances of that peculiar model of government, were highly favourable to this strange spirit of fantastic heroism; which, however unmeaning and ridiculous it may seem, had the most serious and salutary consequences in assisting the gene∣ral growth of refinement, and the progression of civilisation, in forming the manners of Europe, in inculcating the prin∣ciples of honour, and in teaching modes of decorum. The genius of the feudal policy was perfectly martial. A nu∣merous nobility, formed into separate principalities, affecting independence, and mutually jealous of their privileges and honours, necessarily lived in a state of hostility. This situa∣tion rendered personal strength and courage the most requi∣site and essential accomplishments. And hence, even in time of peace, they had no conception of any diversions or public ceremonies, but such as were of the military kind. Yet, as the courts of these petty princes were thronged with ladies of the most eminent distinction and quality, the ruling passion for war was tempered with courtesy. The prize of contending champions was adjudged by the ladies; who did not think it inconsistent to be present or to preside at the bloody spectacles of the times; and who, themselves, seem to have contracted an unnatural and unbecoming ferocity, while they softened the manners of those valorous knights who fought for their approbation. The high notions of a noble descent, which arose from the condition of the feudal constitution, and the ambition of forming an alliance with powerful and opulent families, cherished this romantic system. It was hard to obtain the fair feudatary, who was the object of universal adoration. Not only the splendor of birth, but the magnificent castle surrounded with embattelled walls, guarded with massy towers, and crowned with lofty pinnacles, served to inflame the imagination, and to create an attachment to some illustrious heiress, whose point of honour it was to be chaste and inaccessible. And the difficulty
<PB REF="85"/>
of success on these occasions, seems in great measure to have given rise to that sentimental love of romance, which acquiesced in a distant respectful admiration, and did not aspire to possession. The want of an uniform administration of justice, the general disorder, and state of universal anarchy, which naturally sprung from the principles of the feudal policy, presented perpetual oppor∣tunities of checking the oppressions of arbitrary lords, of delivering captives injuriously detained in the baronial castles, of punishing robbers, of succouring the distressed, and of avenging the impotent and the unarmed, who were every moment exposed to the most licentious insults and injuries. The violence and injustice of the times gave birth to valour and humanity. These acts conferred a lustre and an im∣portance on the character of men professing arms, who made force the substitute of law. In the mean time, the crusades, so pregnant with enterprize, heightened the habits of this warlike fanaticism. And when these foreign expedi∣tions were ended, in which the hermits and pilgrims of Palestine had been defended, nothing remained to employ the activity of adventurers but the protection of innocence at home. Chivalry by degrees was consecrated by religion, whose authority tinctured every passion, and was engrafted into every institution, of the superstitious ages; and at length composed that singular picture of manners, in which the love of a god and of the ladies were reconciled, the saint and the hero were blended, and charity and revenge, zeal and gallantry, devotion and valour, were united.</P>
<P>Those who think that chivalry started late, from the na∣ture of the feudal constitution, confound an improved effect with a simple cause. Not having distinctly considered all the particularities belonging to the genius, manners, and usages of the Gothic tribes, and accustomed to contemplate nations under the general idea of barbarians, they cannot look for the seeds of elegance amongst men, distinguished
<PB REF="86"/>
only for their ignorance and their inhumanity. The rude origin of this heroic gallantry was quickly overwhelmed and extinguished, by the superior pomp which it necessarily adopted from the gradual diffusion of opulence and civility, and that blaze of splendor with which it was surrounded, amid the magnificence of the feudal solemnities. But above all, it was lost and forgotten in that higher degree of embel∣lishment, which at length it began to receive from the repre∣sentations of romance.</P>
<P>From the foregoing observations taken together, the following general and comprehensive conclusion seems to result.</P>
<P>Amid the gloom of superstition, in an age of the grossest ignorance and credulity, a taste for the wonders of oriental fiction was introduced by the Arabians into Europe, many countries of which were already seasoned to a reception of its extravagancies, by means of the poetry of the Gothic s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alds, who perhaps originally derived their ideas from the fame fruitful region of invention. These fictions, coinciding with the reigning manners, and perpetually kept up and improved in the tales of troubadours and minstrels, seem to have centered about the eleventh century in the ideal histories of Turpin and Geoffrey of Monmouth, which record the supposititious atchievements of Charlemagne and king Arthur, where they formed the ground-work of that species of fabulous narrative called romance. And from these be∣ginnings or causes, afterwards enlarged and enriched by kindred fancies fetched from the crusades, that singular and capricious mode of imagination arose, which at length composed the marvellous machineries of the more sublime Italian poets, and of their disciple Spenser.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">DISSERTATION II.</HEAD>
<P>THE irruption of the northern nations into the western empire, about the beginning of the fourth century, forms one of the most interesting and im∣portant periods of modern history. Europe, on this great event, suffered the most memorable revolutions in its govern∣ment and manners; and from the most flourishing state of peace and civility, became on a sudden, and for the space of two centuries, the theatre of the most deplorable devastation and disorder. But among the disasters introduced by these irresistible barbarians, the most calamitous seems to have been the destruction of those arts which the Romans still conti∣nued so successfully to cultivate in their capital, and which they had universally communicated to their conquered pro∣vinces. Towards the close of the fifth century, very few traces of the Roman policy, jurisprudence, sciences, and literature,
<PB REF="88"/>
remained. Some faint sparks of knowledge were kept alive in the monasteries; and letters and the liberal arts were happily preserved from a total extinction during the confusions of the Gothic invaders, by that slender degree of culture and protection which they received from the prelates of the church, and the religious communities.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding the famous academy of Rome<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Theodosius the younger, in the year 425, founded an academy at Con∣stantinople, which he furnished with able professors of every science, intending it as a rival institution to that at Rome. Gianon. Hist. Napl, ii. ch. vi. sect. 1. A noble library had been established at Con∣stantinople by Constantius and Valens be∣fore the year 380, the custody of which was committed to four Greek and three Latin antiquaries or curators. It contained sixty thousand volumes. Zonaras relates, that among other treasures in this library, there was a roll one hundred feet long, made of a dragon's gutt or intestine, on which Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were written in golden letters. See Bibl. Histor. Literar. Select. &amp;c. Ienae, 1754: p. 164. seq. Literature flourished in the eastern empire, while the western was depopulated by the Goths; and for many centuries af∣terwards.

He wrote with little elegance, but he was the first that ever digested a series of royal charts or instruments; a monument of singular utility to the historian, and which has served to throw the
<PB REF="89"/>
most authentic illustration on the public transactions and legal constitutions of those times. Theodoric's patronage of learning is applauded by Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris. Many other Gothic kings were equally attached to the works of peace; and are not less conspicuous for their justice, pru∣dence, and temperance, than for their fortitude and magna∣nimity. Some of them were diligent in collecting the scat∣tered remains of the Roman institutes, and constructing a regular code of jurisprudence <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gianon. Hist. Nap. iii. c. 1</NOTE>. It is highly probable, that those Goths who became masters of Rome, sooner acquired ideas of civility, from the opportunity which that city above all others afforded them of seeing the felicities of polished life, of observing the conveniencies arising from political economy, of mixing with characters respectable for prudence and learning, and of employing in their counsels men of supe∣rior wisdom, whose instruction and advice they found it their interest to follow. But perhaps these northern adventurers, at least their princes and leaders, were not even at their first migrations into the south, so totally savage and uncivilised as we are commonly apt to suppose. Their enemies have been their historians, who naturally painted these violent disturbers of the general repose in the warmest colours. It is not easy to conceive, that the success of their amazing en∣terprizes was merely the effect of numbers and tumultuary depredation: nor can I be persuaded, that the lasting and flourishing governments which they established in various parts of Europe, could have been framed by brutal force alone, and the blind efforts of unreflecting savages. Superior strength and courage must have contributed in a consider∣able degree to their rapid and extensive conquests; but at the same time, such mighty atchievements could not have been planned and executed without some extraordinary vigour of mind, uniform principles of conduct, and no common talents of political sagacity.</P>

Although these commotions must have been particularly unfavourable to the more elegant literature, yet Latin poetry, from a concurrence of causes, had for some time begun to relapse into barbarism. From the growing encrease of christianity, it was deprived of its old fabulous embel∣lishments, and chiefly employed in composing ecclesiastical hymns. Amid these impediments however, and the necessary degeneration of taste and style, a few poets supported the character of the Roman muse with tolerable dignity, during the decline of the Roman empire. These were Ausonius, Paulinus, Sidonius, Sedulius, Arator, Juvencus, Prosper, and Fortunatus. With the last, who flourished at the be∣ginning of the sixth century, and was bishop of Poitiers, the Roman poetry is supposed to have expired.</P>
<P>In the sixth century Europe began to recover some degree of tranquillity. Many barbarous countries during this pe∣riod, particularly the inhabitants of Germany, of Friesland, and other northern nations, were converted to the christian faith <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cave. Saecul. Monoth. p. 440.</NOTE>. The religious controversies which at this time di∣vided the Greek and Latin churches, roused the minds of men to literary enquiries. These disputes in some measure called forth abilities which otherwise would have been un∣known and unemployed; and, together with the subtleties of argumentation, insensibly taught the graces of style, and the habits of composition. Many of the popes were persons of distinguished talents, and promoted useful knowledge no less by example than authority. Political union was by degrees established; and regular systems of government, which alone can ensure personal security, arose in the various provinces of Europe occupied by the Gothic tribes. The Saxons had taken possession of Britain, the Franks be∣came masters of Gaul, the Huns of Pannonia, the Goths of
<PB REF="91"/>
Spain, and the Lombards of Italy. Hence leisure and re∣pose diffused a mildness of manners, and introduced the arts of peace; and, awakening the human mind to a con∣sciousness of its powers, directed its faculties to their proper objects.</P>
<P>In the mean time, no small obstruction to the propagation or rather revival of letters, was the paucity of valuable books. The libraries, particularly those of Italy, which abounded in numerous and inestimable treasures of literature, were every where destroyed by the precipitate rage and undistin∣guishing violence of the northern armies. Towards the close of the seventh century, even in the papal library at Rome, the number of books was so inconsiderable, that pope Saint Martin requested Sanctamand bishop of Maestricht, if possible to supply this defect from the remotest parts of Ger∣many <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Concil. Tom. xv. pag. 285. edit. Pa∣ris, 1641.</NOTE>.

Poggius Florentinus, an eminent restorer of classical literature, says, that in the year 1446, he found a much more correct copy of Quintilian's Institutes than had been yet seen in Italy, almost perishing, at the bottom of a dark neglected tower of the monastery of saint Gall, in France, together with the three first books, and half the fourth of Vale∣rius Flaccus's Argonautics, and Asconius Pe∣dianus's comment on eight orations of Tully. See Poggii Op. p. 309. Amst. 1720. 8vo. The very copy of Quintilian, found by Poggius, is said to have been in lord Sunderland's noble library now at Blenheim. Poggius, in his Dialogue De Infelicitate Principum, says of himself, that he travelled all over Germany in search of books. It is certain that by his means Quintilian, Tertullian, Asconius Pedianus, Lucretius, Sallust, Silius Italicus, Colu∣mella, Manilius, Tully's Orations, Am∣mianus Marcellinus, Valerius Flaccus, and some of the Latin grammarians, and other antient authors, were recovered from ob∣livion, and brought into general notice by being printed in the fifteenth century.

If any person gave a book to a religious house, he believed that so valuable a donation merited eternal salvation, and he offered it on the altar with great ceremony. The most formidable anathemas were pe∣remptorily denounced against those who should dare to alien∣ate a book presented to the cloister or library of a religious house.

Sometimes a book was given to a monastery on con∣dition that the donor should have the use of it during his life: and sometimes to a private person, with the reservation that he who receives it should pray for the soul of his benefactor. The gift of a book to Lincoln cathedral, by bishop Repingdon, in the year 1422, occurs in this form and under these curious circumstances. The memorial is written in Latin, with the bishop's own hand, which I will give in English, at the beginning of Peter's BREVIARY OF THE BIBLE. <Q REND="inline">"I Philip of Repyndon, late bishop of Lincoln, give this book called Peter de Aureolis to the new library to be built within the church of Lincoln: reserving the use and possession of it to Richard Trysely, clerk, canon and pre∣bendary of Miltoun, in fee, and to the term of his life: and afterwards to be given up and restored to the said library, or the keepers of the same, for the time being, faithfully and without delay.

And although the invention of paper, at the close of the ele∣venth century, contributed to multiply manuscripts, and con∣sequently to facilitate knowledge, yet even so late as the reign of our Henry the sixth, I have discovered the following re∣markable instance of the inconveniencies and impediments to study, which must have been produced by a scarcity of books.

This collection was principally made by Charles the fifth, who began his reign

in 1365. This monarch was passionately fond of reading, and it was the fashion to send him presents of books from every part of the kingdom of France. These he ordered to be elegantly transcribed, and richly illuminated; and he placed them in a tower of the Louvre, from thence called, <HI>la toure de la libraire.</HI> The whole consisted of nine hundred volumes. They were deposited in three chambers; which, on this oc∣casion, were wainscotted with Irish oak, and cieled with cypress curiously carved. The windows were of painted glass, fenced with iron bars and copper wire. The English became masters of Paris in the year 1425. On which event the duke of Bedford, regent of France, sent this whole li∣brary, then consisting of only eight hundred and fifty-three volumes, and valued at two thousand two hundred and twenty∣three livres, into England; where perhaps they became the ground-work of duke Humphrey's library just mentioned <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See M.

<P>After the calamities which the state of literature sustained in consequence of the incursions of the northern nations, the first restorers of the antient philosophical sciences in Europe, the study of which, by opening the faculties and extending the views of mankind, gradually led the way to other parts of learning, were the Arabians. In the beginning of the eighth century, this wonderful people, equally fa∣mous for their conquests and their love of letters, in ravaging the Asiatic provinces, found many Greek books, which they read with infinite avidity: and such was the gratification they received from this fortunate acquisition, and so power∣fully their curiosity was excited to make further discoveries in this new field of knowledge, that they requested their ca∣liphs to procure from the emperor at Constantinople the best Greek writers. These they carefully translated into Arabic <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See Abulfarag. per Pocock, Dynast. p. 160. Greek was a familiar language to the Arabians. The accompts of the caliph's treasury were always written in Greek till the year of Christ 715. They were then ordered to be drawn in Arabic. Many proofs of this might be mentioned. Greek was a familiar language in Mahomet's houshold. Zaid, one of Mahomet's secre∣taries, to whom he dictated the Koran, was a perfect master of Greek. Sale's Prelim. Disc. p. 144, 145. The Arabic gold coins were always inscribed with Greek legends till about the year 700.</NOTE>. But every part of the Grecian literature did not equally gratify their taste. The Greek poetry they rejected, because it inculcated polytheism and idolatry, which were inconsistent with their religion.

Of the Greek history they made no use, because it recorded events which preceded their prophet Mahomet. Accustomed to a despotic empire, they neglected the political systems of the Greeks, which taught republican freedom. For the same reasons they despised the eloquence of the Athenian orators. The Greek ethics were super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded by their Alcoran, and on this account they did not study the works of Plato <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Yet Reinesius says, that about the year 750, they translated Plato into Arabic: to∣gether with the works of S.

This system was composed at the desire of Robert duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror's brother: who returning from Jerusalem in one of the crusades, and having heard of the fame of those Salernitan physicians, applied to them for the cure of a wound made by a poisoned arrow. It was written not only in verse, but in rhyming verse, that the prince might more easily retain the rules in his memory. It was published 1100. The author's name is Giovanni di Milano, a celebrated Salernitan physician. The monks of Cassino, hereafter mentioned, much improved this study. See Chron. Cassin. 1. iii. c. 35.

He expended immense sums in purchasing valuable books written in Hebrew, Syriac, and Greek, that they might be translated into Arabic. Many Greek treatises of medicine were translated into that language by his orders. He hired the most learned persons from all quarters of his vast dominions to make these translations.

<P>A curious circumstance of the envy with which the Greeks at Constantinople treated this growing philosophy of the Arabians, is mentioned by Cedrenus. Al-Manun hearing of one Leo, an excellent inathe∣matician at Constantinople, wrote to the emperor, requesting that Leo might be permitted to settle in his dominions, with a most ample salary, as a teacher in that science. The emperor by this means being made acquainted with Leo's merit, esta∣blished a school, in which he appointed Leo a professor, for the sake of a specious ex∣cuse. The caliph sent a second time to the emperor, entreating that Leo might reside with him for a short time only; of∣fering likewise a large sum of money, and terms of lasting peace and alliance. On which the emperor immediately created Leo bishop of Thessalonica. Cedren. Hist. Comp. 548. seq. Herbelot also relates, that the same caliph, so universal was his search after Greek books, procured a copy of Apollonius Pergaeus; the mathemati∣cian. But this copy contained only seven books. In the mean time, finding by the Introduction that the whole consisted of eight books, and that the eighth book was the foundation of the rest, and being in∣formed that there was a complete copy in the emperor's library at Constantinople, he applied to him for a transcript.

Hence it is, that we find our early Latin authors of the dark ages chiefly employed in writing systems of the most abstruse sciences: and from these beginnings the Aristotelic philoso∣phy acquired such establishment and authority, that from long prescription it remains to this day the sacred and un∣controverted doctrine of our schools <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Yet it must not be forgot, that S. Austin had translated part of Aristotle's logic from the original Greek into Latin before the fifth century; and that the peripatetic phi∣losophy must have been partly known to the western scholars from the writings and translations of Boethius, who flourished about the year 520.

And it is easy to conceive, that among these visionary philosophers, so fertile in speculation, logic, and metaphysics, contracted much of that refinement and perplexity, which for so many centuries exercised the genius of profound reasoners and captious disputants, and so long obstructed the progress of true knowledge. It may perhaps be regretted, in the mean time, that this predilection of the Arabian scholars for phi∣losophic enquiries, prevented them from importing into Europe a literature of another kind. But rude and barba∣rous nations would not have been polished by the history, poetry, and oratory of the Greeks. Although capable of comprehending the solid truths of many parts of science, they are unprepared to be impressed with ideas of elegance, and to relish works of taste. Men must be instructed before they can be refined; and, in the gradations of knowledge, polite literature does not take place till some progress has first been made in philosophy. Yet it is at the same time probable, that the Arabians, among their literary stores, brought into Spain and Italy many Greek authors not of the scientific species <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It must not be forgot, that they tran∣slated Aristotle's POETICS.

Literature, however, seems at this period to have flourished with equal reputation at the other extremity of the island, and even in our most northern provinces.

<P>The best writers among the Saxons flourished about the eighth century. These were Aldhelm, bishop of Shirburn, Ceolfrid, Alcuine, and Bede; with whom I must also join king Alfred. But in an enquiry of this nature, Alfred de∣serves particular notice, not only as a writer, but as the illustrious rival of Charlemagne, in protecting and assisting the restoration of literature. He is said to have founded the university of Oxford; and it is highly probable, that in imi∣tation of Charlemagne's similar institutions, he appointed learned persons to give public and gratuitous instructions in theology, but principally in the fashionable sciences of logic, astronomy, arithmetic, and geometry, at that place, which was then a considerable town, and conveniently situated in the neighbourhood of those royal seats at which Alfred chiefly resided. He suffered no priest that was illite∣rate to be advanced to any ecclesiastical dignity <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">MS. Bever. MSS. Coll. Trin. Oxon. Codd. xlvii. f. 82.</NOTE>. He invited his nobility to educate their sons in learning, and requested those lords of his court who had no children, to send to school such of their younger servants as discovered a pro∣mising capacity, and to breed them to the clerical profession <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Bever, ibid.</NOTE>. Alfred, while a boy, had himself experienced the inconve∣niencies arising from a want of scholars, and even of com∣mon instructors, in his dominions: for he was twelve years of age, before he could procure in the western kingdom a master properly qualified to teach him the alphabet. But, while yet unable to read, he could repeat from memory a great variety of Saxon songs <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Flor. Vigorn. sub ann. 871. Bromp∣ton, Chron. in ALFR. p. 814. And MS. Bever, ut supr. It is curious to observe the simplicity of this age, in the method by which Alfred computed time. He caused six wax tapers to be made, each twelve inches long, and of as many ounces in weight: on these tapers he or∣dered the inches to be regularly marked; and having found that one of them burned just four hours, he committed the care of them to the keepers of his chapel, who from time to time gave due notice how the hours went. But as in windy weather the candles were more wasted; to remedy this inconvenience he invented lanthorns, there being then no glass to be met with in his dominions. Asser. Menev. Vit.

In the mean time, and during this very period, the Persians im∣ported into Europe a machine, which pre∣sented the first rudiments of a striking clock. It was brought as a present to Charlemagne, from Abdella king of Persia, by two monks of Jerusalem, in the year 800. Among other presents, says Eginhart, was an horologe of brass, wonderfully con∣structed by some mechanical artifice, in which the course of the twelve hours <HI>ad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dram vertebatur,</HI> with as many little brasen balls, which at the close of each hour dropped down on a sort of bells un∣derneath, and sounded the end of the hour. There were also twelve figures of ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>semen, who, when the twelve hours were completed, issued out at twelve windows, which till then stood open, and returning again, shut the windows after them. He adds, that there were many other curiosities in this instrument, which it would be te∣dious to recount. Eginhart, Kar. Magn. p. 108.

He was fond of cultivating
<PB REF="112"/>
his native tongue: and with a view of inviting the people in general to a love of reading, and to a knowledge of books which they could not otherwise have understood, he tran∣slated many Latin authors into Saxon.

<P>Aldhelm, nephew of Ina king of the West Saxons, fre∣quently visited France and Italy.

Leland mentions his CANTIONES SAXONICAE, one of which continued to be commonly sung in William of Malmesbury's time: and, as it was artfully interspersed with many allusions
<PB REF="114"/>
to passages of Scripture, was often sung by Aldhelm him∣self to the populace in the streets, with a design of alluring the ignorant and idle, by so specious a mode of instruction, to a sense of duty, and a knowledge of religious subjects <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Malms<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ubi supr. p. 4.</NOTE>.

<P>In the mean time we must not form too magnificent ideas of these celebrated masters of science, who were thus invited into foreign countries to conduct the education of mighty monarchs, and to plan the rudiments of the most illustrious academies. Their merits are in great measure relative. Their circle of reading was contracted, their systems of phi∣losophy jejune; and their lectures rather served to stop the growth of ignorance, than to produce any positive or im∣portant improvements in knowledge. They were unable to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcursions from their circumscribed paths of scientific instruction, into the spacious and fruitful regions of liberal and manly study. Those of their hearers, who had passed through the course of the sciences with applause, and aspired to higher acquisitions, were exhorted to read Cassiodorus and Boethius; whose writings they placed at the summit of profane literature, and which they believed to be the great boundaries of human erudition.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned Ceolfrid's presents of books to Benedict's library at Weremouth abbey. He wrote an account of his travels into France and Italy.

<P>But Bede, whose name is so nearly and necessarily connected with every part of the literature of this pe∣riod, and which has therefore been often already mentioned, emphatically styled the Venerable by his cotemporaries, was by far the most learned of the Saxon writers.

perspicuity and facility in his Latin style. But it is void of elegance, and often of purity; it shews with what grace and propriety he would have written, had his mind been formed on better models. Whoever looks for digestion of mate∣rials, disposition of parts, and accuracy of narration, in this writer's historical works, expects what could not exist at that time. He has recorded but few civil transactions: but besides that his history professedly considers ecclesiastical affairs, we should remember, that the building of a church, the preferment of an abbot, the canonisation of a martyr, and the importation into England of the shin-bone of an apostle, were necessarily matters of much more importance in Bede's conceptions than victories or revolutions. He is fond of minute description; but particularities are the fault and often the merit of early historians <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">An ingenious author, who writes under the name of M. de Vigneul Marville, ob∣serves, that Bede, <Q REND="inline">"when he speaks of the Magi who went to worship our Saviour, is very particular in the account of their names, age, and respective offerings. He says, that Melchior was old, and had grey hair, with a long beard; and that it was he who offered gold to Christ, in acknowledgment of his sove∣reignty. That Gaspar, the second of the magi, was young, and had no beard, and that it was he who offered frankin∣cense, in recognition of our Lord's di∣vinity: and that Balthasar the third, was of a dark complexion, had a large beard, and offered myrrh to our Saviour's humanity."</Q> He is likewise very circumstantial in the description of their dresses.

<P>The strict and superabundant attention of these Latin poets to prosodic rules, on which it was become fashionable to write didactic systems, made them accurate to excess in the metrical conformation of their hexameters, and produced a faultless and flowing monotony.

I have already observed, and from good authorities, that many of these Saxon scholars were skilled in Greek. Yet scarce any considerable monuments have descended to modern times, to prove their familiarity with that language. I will, however, mention such as have occurred to me. Archbishop Parker, or rather his learned scribe Jocelin, affirms, that the copy of Homer, and of some of the other books im∣ported into England by archbishop Theodore, as I have above related, remained in his time <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Antiquitat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit. p. 80.</NOTE>. There is however no allusion to Homer, nor any mention made of his name, in the writings of the Saxons now existing <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See SECT. iii. p. 124. infr. Where it is observed, that Homer is cited by Geof∣frey of Monmouth. But he is not men∣tioned in Geoffrey's Armoric original.</NOTE>. In the Bodleian library are some extracts from the books of the Prophets in Greek and Latin: the Latin is in Saxon, and the Greek in Latino-greek capital characters. A Latino-greek alphabet is prefixed. In the same manuscript is a chapter of Deutero∣nomy, Greek and Latin, but both are in Saxon characters <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">NE. D. 19. MSS. membr. 8vo. fol. 24. 19.</NOTE>. In the curious and very valuable library of Bennet college in Cambridge, is a very antient copy of Aldhelm DE LAUDE VIRGINITATIS. In it is inserted a specimen of Saxon poetry full of Latin and Greek words, and at the end of the ma∣nuscript some Runic letters occur <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cod. MSS. K 12.</NOTE>. I suspect that their Grecian literature was a matter of ostentation rather than use. William of Malmesbury, in his life of Aldhelm, cen∣sures an affectation in the writers of this age; that they were fond of introducing in their Latin compositions a difficult and abstruse word latinised from the Greek <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ubi supr. p. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. There are many instances of this pedantry in the early charters of Dugdale's Monasticon.

Pontific. i. f. 114.</NOTE>."</Q> Probably to be able to read Greek at this time was esteemed a knowledge of that language. Eginhart relates, that Charlemagne could speak Latin as fluently as his native Frankish: but slightly passes over his accomplishment in Greek, by artfully saying, that he un∣derstood it better than he could pronounce it <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vit. Kar. Magn. p. 30.</NOTE>. Nor, by the way, was Charlemagne's boasted facility in the Latin so remarkable a prodigy. The Latin language was familiar to the Gauls when they were conquered by the Franks; for they were a province of the Roman empire till the year 485. It was the language of their religious offices, their laws, and public transactions. The Franks who conquered the Gauls at the period just mentioned, still continued this usage, imagining there was a superior dignity in the language of imperial Rome: although this incorporation of the Franks with the Gauls greatly corrupted the latinity of the latter, and had given it a strong tincture of barbarity before the reign of Charlemagne. But while we are bringing proofs which tend to extenuate the notion that Greek was now much known or cultivated, it must not be dissembled, that John Erigena, a native of Aire in Scotland, and one of king Alfred's first lecturers at Oxford <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wood Hist.

<P>As to classic authors, it appears that not many of them were known or studied by our Saxon ancestors. Those with which they were most acquainted, either in prose or verse, seem to have been of the lower empire; writers who, in the declension of taste, had superseded the purer and more an∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Roman models, and had been therefore more recen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and frequently transcribed. I have mentioned Alfred's trans∣lations of Boethius and Orosius. Prudentius was also per∣haps one of their favorites. In the British Museum there is a manuscript copy of that poet's PSYCOMACHIA.

<PB REF="124"/>
that Aldhelm wrote his book DE VIRGINITATE, which is both prose and verse, in imitation of the manner of Sedu∣lius <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Eccl. Hist. 19.</NOTE>. We learn from Gregory of Tours, what is not foreign to our purpose to remark, that king Chilperic, who began to reign in 562, wrote two books of Latin verses in imitation of Sedulius.

It is certain that literature was at its height among our Saxon ancestors about the eighth century. These happy be∣ginnings were almost entirely owing to the attention of king Alfred, who encouraged learning by his own example, by founding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eminaries of instruction, and by rewarding the labours of scholars. But the efforts of this pious monarch were soon blasted by the supineness of his successors, the incursions of the Danes, and the distraction of national af∣fairs. Bede, from the establishment of learned bishops in every diocese, and the universal tranquillity which reigned over all the provinces of England, when he finished his ec∣clesiastical history, flatters his imagination in anticipating
<PB REF="126"/>
the most advantageous consequences, and triumphantly closes his narrative with this pleasing presentiment. The Picts, at this period, were at peace with the Saxons or English, and converted to christianity. The Scots lived contented within their own boundary. The Britons or Welsh, from a natural enmity, and a dislike to the catholic institution of keeping Easter, sometimes attempted to disturb the national repose; but they were in some measure subservient to the Saxons. Among the Northumbrians, both the nobility and private persons rather chose their children should receive the mo∣nastic tonsure, than be trained to arms <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Bede, Eccl. Hist. v. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But a long night of confusion and gross ignorance suc∣ceeded. The principal productions of the most eminent monasteries for three centuries, were incredible legends which discovered no marks of invention, unedifying homilies, and trite expositions of the scriptures. Many bishops and abbots began to consider learning as pernicious to true piety, and confounded illiberal igno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance with christian simplicity. Leland frequently laments the loss of libraries destroyed in the Danish invasions <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Malmesb. apud Lel. Coll. 1. p. 140. edit. n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p.</NOTE>. Some slight attempts were made for restoring literary pursuits, but with little success. In the tenth century, Oswald archbishop of Canterbury, finding the monasteries of his province extremely ignorant not only in the common elements of grammar, but even in the canonical rules of their respective orders, was obliged to send into France for competent masters, who might remedy these evils <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wharton.

Ital. Med. aev. iii. 831. ii. 141. And Boulay, Hist. Acad. Paris. i. 288.</NOTE>. In the mean time, from perpetual commotions, the manners of the people had degenerated from that mildness which a short interval of peace and letters had introduced,
<PB REF="127"/>
and the national character had contracted an air of rudenes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ferocity.</P>
<P>England at length, in the beginning of the eleventh cen∣tury, received from the Normans the rudiments of that cultivation which it has preserved to the present times. The Normans were a people who had acquired ideas of splendor and refinement from their residence in France; and the gallantries of their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udal system introduced new magni∣ficence and elegance among our rough unpolished ancestors. The conqueror's army was composed of the flower of the Norman nobility; who sharing allotments of land in different parts of the new territory, diffused a general knowledge of various improvements entirely unknown in the most flou∣rishing eras of the Saxon government, and gave a more libe∣ral turn to the manners even of the provincial inhabita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. That they brought with them the arts, may yet be seen by the castles and churches which they built on a more extensive and stately plan <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This point will be further illustrated in a work now preparing for the press, en∣titled, OBSERVATIONS CRITICAL AND HISTORICAL, ON CASTLES, CHURCHES, MONASTERIES, and other MONUM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NTS O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ANTIQUITY IN VARIOUS P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RTS OF ENGLAND.

<P>Towards the close of the tenth century, an event took place, which gave a new and very fortunate turn to the state of letters in France and Italy. A little before that time, there were no schools in Europe but those whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> belonged to the monasteries or episcopal churches; and the monks were almost the only masters employed to educate the youth in the principles of sacred and profane erudition.

most capital cities of France and Italy this important charge. The Latin versions of the Greek philosophers from the Arabic, had now become so frequent and common, as to fall into the hands of the people; and many of these new preceptors having travelled into Spain with a design of studying in the Arabic schools <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This fashion continued for a long time. Among many who might here be men∣tioned was Daniel Merlac, an Englishman, who, in the year 1185, went to Toledo to learn mathematics, and brought back with him into England several books of the Arabian philosophy.

These and other beneficial effects, arising from this practice of admitting others besides ecclesiastics to the profession of letters, and the education of youth, were imported into Eng∣land by means of the Norman conquest.</P>
<P>The conqueror himself patronised and loved letters. He filled the bishopricks and abbacies of England with the most learned of his countrymen, who had been educated at the university of Paris, at that time the most flourishing school in Europe. He placed Lanfranc, abbot of the monastery of Saint Stephen at Caen, in the see of Canterbury; an eminent master of logic, the subtleties of which he employed with great dexterity in a famous controversy concerning the real presence. Anselm, an acute metaphysician and theologist, his immediate successor in the same see, was called from the government of the abbey of Bec in Normandy. Herman, a Norman bishop of Salisbury, founded a noble library in the antient cathedral of that see <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"Nobilem bibliothecam, comparatis in hoc optimis juxta ac antiquissimis illus∣trium autorum monumentis, Severiae po∣suit."</Q> <BIBL>Leland.

A circumstance, which by the way shews that the literature of the monks at this period was of a more liberal cast than that which we commonly annex to their character and profession. Geoffrey, a learned Norman, was invited from the university of Paris to superintend the direction of the school of the abbey of Dunstable; where he composed a play called the Play of SAINT CATHARINE <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See infr.

This was perhaps the first spectacle of the kind that was ever at∣tempted, and the first trace of theatrical representation which appeared, in England. Mathew Paris, who first records this anecdote, says, that Geoffrey borrowed copes from the sacrist of the neighbouring abbey of saint Alban's to dress his characters.

Robert d'Oilly, constable of Oxford castle, was ordered to pay for the board of the young prince in the convent, which the king himself frequently visited <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hist. Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Univ. Oxon. i. 46.</NOTE>. Nor was Wil∣liam wanting in giving ample revenues to learning: he founded the magnificent abbies of Battel and Selby, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other smaller convents. His nobles and their successors co∣operated with this liberal spirit in erecting many monaste∣ries. Herbert de Losinga, a monk of Normandy, bishop of Thetford in Norfolk, instituted and endowed with large possessions a Benedictine abbey at Norwich, consisting of sixty monks. To mention no more instances, such great institutions of persons dedicated to religious and literary leisure, while they diffused an air of civility, and softened the manners of the people in their respective circles, must have afforded powerful invitations to studious pursuits, and have consequently added no small degree of stability to the interests of learning.</P>
<P>By these observations, and others which have occurred in the course of our enquiries, concerning the utility of monas∣teries, I certainly do not mean to defend the monastic system. We are apt to pass a general and undistinguishing censure on the monks, and to suppose their foundations to have been the retreats of illiterate indolence at every period of time. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it should be remembered, that our universities about the time of the Norman conquest, were in a low condition: while the monasteries contained ample endowments and ac∣commodations, and were the only respectable seminaries of literature. A few centuries afterwards, as our universities began to flourish, in consequence of the distinctions and
<PB REF="131"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onours which they conferred on scholars, the establishment of colleges, the introduction of new systems of science, the universal ardour which prevailed of breeding almost all persons to letters, and the abolition of that exclusive right of teaching which the ecclesiastics had so long claimed; the monasteries of course grew inattentive to studies, which were more strongly encouraged, more commodiously pursued, and more successfully cultivated, in other places: they gradually became contemptible and unfashionable as nurseries of learn∣ing, and their fraternities degenerated into sloth and igno∣rance. The most eminent scholars which England produced, both in philosophy and humanity, before and even below the twelfth century, were educated in our religious houses. The encouragement given in the English monasteries for transcribing books, the scarcity of which in the middle ages we have before remarked, was very considerable. In every great abbey there was an apartment called the SCRIPTORIUM: where many writers were constantly busied in transcribing not only the service-books for the choir, but books for the library <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">This was also a practice in the monas∣teries abroad; in which the boys and no∣vices were chiefly employed.

<P>Latin rhymes seem to have been first used in the church-hymns. But Leonine verse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are properly the Roman hexamet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs or pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tameters rhymed. And it is not improbab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that they took their name from the monk abovementioned, who was the most popular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd almost only Latin poet of his time in France. He wrote many Latin pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es not in rhyme, and in a good style of Latin ver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ification. Particularly a Latin heroi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poem in twelve books, containing the history of the bible from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> creation of the world to the story of Ruth. Also some elegies<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which have a tolerable degree of classic purity. Some suppose, that pope Leo the second, about the year 680, a great reformer of the chants and hymns of the church, in∣vented this sort of verse.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that Bede who lived in the eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h century, in his book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E ART<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TRICA, does not see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that rhyme was a common ornament of the church hymns of his time, many of which he quotes. See Opp. tom. i. 34<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cap. pe∣nult. But this chapter, I think, is all take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom Marius Victorinus, a much older writer. The hymns which Bede quotes are extremely barbarous, consisting of a modu∣lated structure, or a certain number of fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without quantity; like the odes of the minstrels or scalds of that age. <Q REND="inline">"Ut sunt, he says, carmina VULGARIUM POETA∣RUM."</Q> In the mean time we must not forget, that the early French troubadours mention a sort of rhyme in their vernacular poetry partly distinguished from the com∣mon species, which they call Leonine or Leonime. Thus Gualtier Arbalestrier de Belle-perche, in the beginning of his ro∣mance of Judas Maccabeus, written before the year 1280.</P>

<P>Smoothness of versification was an excellence which, like their Saxon predecessors, they studied to a fault. Henry of Huntingdon, commonly known and celebrated as an histo∣rian, was likewise a terse and polite Latin poet of this pe∣riod. He was educated under Alcuine of Anjou, a canon of Lincoln cathedral. His principal patrons were Aldwin and Reginald, both Normans, and abbots of Ramsey. His turn for poetry did not hinder his arriving to the dignity of an archdeacon. Leland mentions eight books of his epi∣grams, amatorial verses <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See Wharton, Angl. Sacr. ii. 29.</NOTE>, and poems on philosophical sub∣jects <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lel.

But Leland appears to have been most pleased with Henry's poetical epistle to Elfleda, the daughter of Alfred <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ut supr.</NOTE>.

His credulity as an historian has been deservedly censured: but fabulous histories were then the fashion, and he well knew the recommendation his work would receive from comprehending all the popular traditions <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Leland, Script.

<P>We must not judge of the general state of society by the more ingenious and dignified churchmen of this period; who seem to have surpassed by the most disproportionate degrees in point of knowledge, all other members of the commu∣nity. Thomas of Becket, who belongs to the twelfth cen∣tury, and his friends, in their epistles, distinguish each other by the appellation of philosophers, in the course of their correspondence <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In the British Museum, MSS. Cot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> TIT. A. xix. VESPAS. E. iv.</NOTE>.

from many passages in their writings, appear, and not with¦out reason, to have considered the rest of the world as totally immersed in ignorance and barbarity. A most distinguished ornament of this age was John of Salisbury <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Studuit in Italia omnium bonarum artium facile post Graeciam parente."</Q> <BIBL>Leland. Script.

Montfaucon asserts, that some parts of the supplement to Petronius, published as a genuine and valuable discovery a few years ago, but since supposed to be spurious, are quoted in the POLICRATICON <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>Bibl.

He was promoted to high stations in the church by Henry the second, whose court was crouded with scho∣lars, and almost equalled that of his cotemporary William king of Sicily, in the splendor which it derived from encou∣raging erudition, and assembling the learned of various countries <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Leland, Script.

by the brilliancy of his genius, and the variety of his litera∣ture, to Anselm, archbishop of that see <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Leland, Script. Brit. p. 178. There is a poem DE LAUDIBUS ANSELMI, and an epicedion on that prelate, commonly ascribed to Eadmer. See Fabric. Bibl. Med. Lat. ii. p. 210. seq. Leland doubts whether these piece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> belong to him or to William of Chester, a learned monk, pa∣tronised by Anselm. Script. Brit. p. 185.</NOTE>. He was an elegant writer of history, but exceeded in the artifices of composi∣tion, and the choice of matter, by his cotemporary William of Malmesbury. The latter was a monk of Malmesbury, and it reflects no small honour on his fraternity that they elected him their librarian <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lel. p. 195. But see Wharton, Angl. Sacr. ii. Praef. p. xii.</NOTE>. His merits as an historian have been justly displayed and recommended by lord Lyttelton <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">In his History of Henry the second.</NOTE>. But his abilities were not confined to prose. He wrote many pieces of Latin poetry; and it is remarkable, that almost all the professed writers in prose of this age made experiments in verse. His patron was Robert earl of Glo∣cester; who, amidst the violent civil commotions which disquieted the reign of king Stephen, found leisure and opportunity to protect and promote literary merit <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See Cave, Hist. Lit. p. 661.</NOTE>. Till Malmesbury's works appeared, Bede had been the chief and principal writer of English history. But a general spirit of writing history, owing to that curiosity which more polished manners introduce, to an acquaintance with the antient histo∣rians, and to the improved knowledge of a language in which facts could be recorded with grace and dignity, was now pre∣vailing. Besides those I have mentioned, Simeon of Dur∣ham, Roger Hoveden, and Benedict abbot of Peterborough, are historians whose narratives have a liberal cast, and whose
<PB REF="142"/>
details rise far above the dull uninteresting precision of pa∣tient annalists and regular chronologers. John Hanvill, a monk of Saint Alban's, about the year 1190, studied rhe∣toric at Paris, and was distinguished for his taste even among the numerous and polite scholars of that flourishing semi∣nary <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lel. p. 259.</NOTE>. His ARCHITRENIUS is a learned, ingenious, and very entertaining performance. It is a long Latin poem in nine books, dedicated to Walter bishop of Rouen. The design of the work may be partly conjectured from its af∣fected Greek title: but it is, on the whole, a mixture of satire and panegyric on public vice and virtue, with some historical digressions. In the exordium is the following ner∣vous and spirited address.</P>

Such was the pedantry of the times, that in the year 1503, archbishop Wareham, chancellor of Oxford, at his feast of inthronisation, ordered to be intro∣duced in the first course a curious dish, in which were exhibited the eight towers of the university. In every tower s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bedell; and under the towers were figures of the king, to whom the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncellor Wareham, encircled with many doctors pro∣perly habited, presented four Latin verses, which were answered by his majesty. The eight towers were those of Merton, Mag∣dalene, and New College, and of the mo∣nasteries of Oseney, Rewley, the Dominican, Augustine, and Franciscan friars, which five last are now utterly destroyed.

I cannot resist the pleasure of transcribing from this book his picture of the romantic situation of the abbey of Lantony in Monmouthshire. I will give it in English, as my meaning is merely to shew how great a master the author was of that selection of circumstances which forms an agreeable descrip∣tion, and which could only flow from a cultivated mind. <Q REND="inline">"In the deep vale of Ewias, which is about a bowshot over, and enclosed on all sides with high mountains, stands the abbey church of saint John, a structure covered with lead, and not unhandsomely built for so lonesome a situation: on the very spot, where formerly stood a small chapel dedicated to saint David, which had no other ornaments than green moss and ivy. It is a situation fit for the exer∣cise of religion; and a religious edifice was first founded in this sequestered retreat to the honour of a solitary life, by two hermits, remote from the noise of the world, upon the banks of the river Hondy, which winds through the midst of the valley.—The rains which mountainous countries usually produce, are here very frequent, the winds exceedingly tempestuous, and the winters almost

continually dark. Yet the air of the valley is so happily tempered, as scarcely to be the cause of any diseases. The monks sitting in the cloisters of the abbey, when they chuse for a momentary refreshment to cast their eyes abroad, have on every side a pleasing prospect of moun∣tains ascending to an immense height, with numerous herds of wild deer feeding aloft on the highest extremity of this lofty horizon. The body of the sun is not visible above the hills till after the meridian hour, even when the air is most clear."</Q> Giraldus adds, that Roger bishop of Salisbury, prime minister to Henry the first, having visited this place, on his return to court told the king, that all the treasure of his majesty's kingdom would not suffice to build such another cloister.

<P>But a miracle of this age in classical composition was Joseph of Exeter, commonly called Josephus Iscanus. He wrote two epic poems in Latin heroics. The first is on the Trojan War; it is in six books, and dedicated to Baldwin archbishop of Canterbury <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See lib. i. 32.

The existence and name of this poem seem to have been utterly unknown in England when Leland wrote. He first met with a manuscript copy of it by mere accident in Magdalene college library at Oxford. He never had even heard of it before. He afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound two more copies at Paris. But these were all imperfect, and without the name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the author, except a marginal hint. At length he discovered a complete copy of it in the library of Thorney abbey in Cambridgeshire, which seems to have ascertained the author's name, but not his country. Script. Brit. p. 238. The neglect of this poem among our ancestors, I mean in the ages which followed Isca∣nus, appears from the few manuscripts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now remaining in England.

But all the printed copies have omitted passages which I find in the Digby manuscript. Particularly they omit, in the address to Baldwin, four lines after v. 32. lib. i. Thirteen lines, in which the poet alludes to his intended ANTIOCHEIS, are omitted before v. 962. lib. vi. Nor have they the verses in which he compliments Henry the second, said by Leland to be at the end of the fourth book, Script. Brit. p. 238. The truth is, these passages would have betrayed their first editor's pretence of this poem being written by Cornelius Nepos.

There seems to have been a rival spirit of writing Latin heroic poems about this period. In France, Guillaume le Breton, or William of Bretagny, about the year 1230, wrote a Latin heroic poem on Philip Augustus king of France, about the commencement of the thirteenth century, in twelve books, entitled PHILIPPIS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">He wrote it at fifty-five years of age.

Robert Grosthead, bishop of Lincoln, an universal scholar, and no less conver∣sant in polite letters than the most abstruse sciences, culti∣vated and patronised the study of the Greek language.

<P>But, to return to the leading point of our enquiry, this promising dawn of polite letters and rational know∣ledge was soon obscured. The temporary gleam of light did not arrive to perfect day. The minds of scholars were diverted from these liberal studies in the rapidity of their career; and the arts of composition, and the ornaments of language were neglected, to make way for the barbarous and barren subtleties of scholastic divinity. The first teachers of this art, originally founded on that spirit of intricate and metaphysical enquiry which the Arabians had communicated to philosophy, and which now became almost absolutely necessary for defending the doctrines of Rome, were Peter Lombard archbishop of Paris, and the celebrated Abelard: men whose consummate abilities were rather qualified to re∣form the church, and to restore useful science, than to cor∣rupt both, by confounding the common sense of mankind with frivolous speculation <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">They both flourished about the year 1150.</NOTE>. These visionary theologists never explained or illustrated any scriptural topic: on the contrary, they perverted the simplest expressions of the sacred text, and embarrassed the most evident truths of the gospel by laboured distinctions and unintelligible solutions.

<P><PB REF="164"/>
Nor was the profession of the civil and canonical laws a small impediment to the propagation of those letters which humanise the mind, and cultivate the manners. I do not mean to deny, that the accidental discovery of the imperial code in the twelfth century, contributed in a considerable degree to civilise Europe, by introducing, among other be∣neficial consequences, more legitimate ideas concerning the nature of government and the administration of justice, by creating a necessity of transferring judicial decrees from an illiterate nobility to the cognisance of scholars, by lessening the attachment to the military profession, and by giving ho∣nour and importance to civil employments: but to suggest, that the mode in which this invaluable system of jurispru∣dence was studied, proved injurious to polite literature. It was no sooner revived, than it was received as a scholastic science, and taught by regular professors, in most of the universities of Europe. To be skilled in the theology of the schools was the chief and general ambition of scholars: but at the same time a knowledge of both the laws was become an indispensable requisite, at least an essential re∣commendation, for obtaining the most opulent ecclesiastical dignities. Hence it was cultivated with universal avidity. It became so considerable a branch of study in the plan of academical discipline, that twenty scholars out of seventy were destined to the study of the civil and canon laws, in one of the most ample colleges at Oxford, founded in the year 1385. And it is easy to conceive the pedantry with which it was pursued in these seminaries during the middle ages. It was treated with the same spirit of idle speculation which had been carried into philosophy and theology, it was over∣whelmed with endless commentaries which disclaimed all elegance of language, and served only to exercise genius, as it afforded materials for framing the flimsy labyrinths of casuistry.</P>
<P><PB REF="165"/>
It was not indeed probable, that these attempts in elegant literature which I have mentioned should have any per∣manent effects. The change, like a sudden revolution in go∣vernment, was too rapid for duration. It was moreover premature, and on that account not likely to be lasting. The habits of superstition and ignorance were as yet too powerful for a reformation of this kind to be effected by a few polite scholars. It was necessary that many circumstances and events, yet in the womb of time, should take place, before the minds of men could be so far enlightened as to receive these improvements.</P>
<P>But perhaps inventive poetry lost nothing by this relapse. Had classical taste and judgment been now established, ima∣gination would have suffered, and too early a check would have been given to the beautiful extravagancies of romantic fabling. In a word, truth and reason would have chased before their time those spectres of illusive fancy, so pleasing to the imagination, which delight to hover in the gloom of ignorance and superstition, and which form so considerable a part of the poetry of the succeeding centuries.</P>

<P>The last of these three dialects, with which these Annals of English Poetry commence, formed a language extremely bar∣barous, irregular, and intractable; and consequently pro∣mises no very striking specimens in any species of composi∣tion. Its substance was the Danish Saxon, adulterated with French. The Saxon indeed, a language subsisting on uni∣form principles, and polished by poets and theologists, how∣ever corrupted by the Danes, had much perspicuity, strength, and harmony: but the French imported by the Conqueror and his people, was a confused jargon of Teutonic, Gaulish, and vitiated Latin. In this fluctuating state of our national speech, the French predominated. Even before the conquest the Saxon language began to fall into contempt, and the French, or Frankish, to be substituted in its stead: a circum∣stance, which at once facilitated and foretold the Norman accession. In the year 652, it was the common practice of
<PB N="3" REF="168"/>
the Anglo-Saxons, to send their youth to the monasteries of France for education <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dugd. Mon. i. 89.</NOTE>: and not only the language, but the manners of the French, were esteemed the most polite accom∣plishments <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ingulph. Hist. p. 62. sub. ann. 1043.</NOTE>. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, the resort of Normans to the English court was so frequent, that the affectation of imitating the Frankish customs became almost universal: and even the lower class of people were ambitious of catching the Frankish idiom. It was no difficult task for the Norman lords to banish that language, of which the na∣tives began to be absurdly ashamed. The new invaders com∣manded the laws to be administered in French <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">But there is a precept in Saxon from William the first, to the sheriff of Somer∣setshire. Hickes. Thes. i. par. i. pag. 106. See also Praefat. ibid. p. xv.</NOTE>. Many char∣ters of monasteries were forged in Latin by the Saxon monks, for the present security of their possessions, in consequence of that aversion which the Normans professed to the Saxon tongue <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The Normans who practiced every specious expedient to plunder the monks, demanded a sight of the written evidences of their lands. The monks well knew, that it would have been useless or impoli∣tic to have produced these evidences, or charters, in the original Saxon; as the Normans not only did not understand, but would have received with contempt, instru∣ments written in that language. There∣fore the monks were compelled to the pious fraud of forging them in Latin: and great numbers of these forged Latin charters, till lately supposed original, are still extant.

An intermixture of the Saxon character is common in English and Latin manuscripts, before the reign of Edward the third: but of a few types only.</NOTE>. Yet this is almost a single example. That monarch's motive was perhaps political: and he seems to have practised this expedient with a view of obliging his queen, who was of Saxon lineage; or with a design of flat∣tering his English subjects, and of securing his title already strengthened by a Saxon match, in consequence of so specious and popular an artifice. It was a common and indeed a very natural practice, for the transcribers of Saxon books, to change the Saxon orthography for the Norman, and to sub∣stitute in the place of the original Saxon, Norman words and

phrases.

The plan of the great royal revenue-rolls, now called the pipe-rolls, were of their construction, and in that language. But from the declension of the barons, and pre∣valence of the commons, most of whom were of English ancestry, the native language of England gradually gained ground: till at length the interest of the commons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o far succeeded with Edward the third, that an act of parliament was passed, appointing all pleas and proceedings of law to be carried on in English <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">But the French formularies and terms of law, and particularly the French feudal phraseology, had taken too deep root to be thus hastily abolished. Hence, long after the reign of Edward the third, many of our lawyers composed their tracts in French. And reports and some statutes were made in that language. See Fortescut. de Laud. Leg.

It abolished a token of subjection and disgrace: and in some degree, contributed to prevent further French innovations in the language then used, which yet remained in a compound state, and retained a considerable mixture of foreign phraseo∣logy. In the mean time, it must be remembered, that this corruption of the Saxon was not only owing to the admis∣sion of new words, occasioned by the new alliance, but to changes of its own forms and terminations, arising from reasons which we cannot investigate or explain <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This subject will be further illustrated in the next section.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among the manuscripts of Digby in the Bodleian library at Oxford, we find a religious or moral Ode, consisting of one hundred and ninety-one stanzas, which the learned Hickes places just after the conquest <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ling. Vett. Thes. Part. i. p. 222. There is another copy not mentioned by Hickes, in Jesus College library at Ox∣ford, MSS. 85. infr. citat.

In deference however to so great an authority, I am obliged to mention it here; and especially as it exhibits a regular lyric strophe of four lines, the second and fourth of which rhyme together. Although these four lines may be perhaps resolved into two Alexandrines; a measure concern∣ing which more will be said hereafter, and of which it will be sufficient to remark at present, that it appears to have been used very early. For I cannot recollect any strophes of this sort in the elder Runic or Saxon poetry; nor in any of the old Frankish poems, particularly of Otfrid, a monk of Weissenburgh, who turned the evangelical history into Frankish verse about the ninth century, and has left several
<PB N="8" REF="173"/>
hymns in that language <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Petr. Lambec. Comment. de Bibl. Caesar. Vindebon. pag. 418. 457.</NOTE>, of Stricker who celebrated the atchievements of Charlemagne <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Petr. Lambec. ubi supr. lib. ii. cap. 5. There is a circumstance belonging to the antient Frankish versification, which, as it greatly illustrates the subject of allite∣ration, deserves notice here. Otfrid's de∣dication of his Evangelical history to Lewis the first, king of the oriental France, consists of four lined stanzas in rhyming couplets: but the first and last line of every stanzas begin and end with the same letter: and the letters of the title of the dedica∣tion respectively, and the word of the last line of every tetrastic. Flaccus Illyrius published this work of Otfrid at Basil, 1571. But I think it has been since more correctly printed by Johannes Schilterus. It was written about the year 880.

See MSS. Harl. 2247. fol. and 2371. 4to. and 2391. 4to. and 2402. 4to. and 2800. seq. Manuscript lives of Saints, detached, and not belonging to this collection, are fre∣quent in libraries. The <HI>Vitae Patrum</HI> were originally drawn from S. Jerome and Jo∣hannes Cassianus. In Gresham college li∣brary are metrical lives of ten Saints chiefly from the <HI>Golden Legend,</HI> by Osberne Boken∣ham, an Augustine canon in the abbey of Stoke-clare in Suffolk, transcribed by Thomas Burgh at Cambridge 1477. The Life of S. Katharine appears to have been composed in 1445. MSS. Coll. Gresh. 315. The French translation of the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nda Au∣rea</HI> was made by Jehan de Vignay, a monk, soon after 1300.</NOTE>.

I shall cite it under the title of MS. Vernon. Although pieces not absolutely religious are sometimes intro∣duced, the scheme of the compiler or trans∣criber seems to have been, to form a com∣plete body of legendary and scriptural his∣tory in verse, or rather to collect into one view all the religious poetry he could find. Accordingly the <HI>Lives of the Saints,</HI> a dis∣tinct and large work of itself, properly constituted a part of his plan. There is an∣other copy of the <HI>Lives of the Saints</HI> in the British Museum, MSS. Harl. 2277. And in Ashmole's Museum, MSS. Ashm. ut supr. I think this manuscript is also in Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> col∣lege library. The Lives seem to be placed according to their respective festivals in the course of the year. The Bodleian copy (marked 779.) is a thick folio, containing 310 leaves. The variations in these manu∣scripts seem chiefly owing to the transcribers. The <HI>Life</HI> of Saint Margaret in MSS. Bodl. 779. begins much like that of Trinity library at Cambridge.

<P>In the valuable library of Corpus Christi college in Cam∣bridge, is a sort of poetical biblical history, extracted from the books of Genesis and Exodus. It was probably composed about the reign of Henry the second or Richard the first. But I am chiefly induced to cite this piece, as it proves the excessive attachment of our earliest poets to rhyme: they were fond of multiplying the same final sound to the most tedious monotony; and without producing any effect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legance, strength, or harmony.

<P>This mode of writing is not uncommon in antient manu∣scripts of French poetry. And some critics may be inclined to suspect, that the verses which we call Alexandrine, acci∣dentally assumed their form merely from the practice of ab∣surd transcribers, who frugally chose to fill their pages to the extremity, and violated the metrical structure for the sake
<PB N="36" REF="201"/>
of saving their vellum. It is certain, that the common stanza of four short lines may be reduced into two Alexandrines, and on the contrary. I have before observed, that the Saxon poem cited by Hickes, consisting of one hundred and ninety one stanzas, is written in stanzas in the Bodleian, and in Alexandrines in the Trinity manuscript at Cambridge. How it came originally from the poet I will not pretend to de∣termine.</P>
<P>Our early poetry often appears in satirical pieces on the established and eminent professions. And the writers, as we have already seen, succeeded not amiss when they cloathed their satire in allegory. But nothing can be conceived more scurrilous and illiberal than their satires when they descend to mere invective. In the British Museum, among other ex∣amples which I could mention, we have a satirical ballad on the lawyers <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">MSS. ut sup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. f. 70. b.</NOTE>, and another on the clergy, or rather some par∣ticular bishop. The latter begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Hyrd-men hatieth ant vch mones hyne,</L>
<L>For ever uch a parosshe heo polketh in pyne</L>
<L>Ant clastreth wyf heore celle:</L>

<P>The elder French poetry abounds in allegorical satire: and I doubt not that the author of the satire on the monastic profession, cited above, copied some French satire on the subject. Satire was one species of the poetry of the Proven∣cial troubadours. Anselm Fayditt a troubadour of the ele∣venth century, who will again be mentioned, wrote a sort of satirical drama called the HERESY of the FATHERS, HERE∣GIA DEL PREYRES, a ridicule on the council which con∣demned the Albigenses. The papal legates often fell under
<PB N="37" REF="202"/>
the lash of these poets; whose favour they were obliged to court, but in vain, by the promise of ample gratuities <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fontenelle, Hist. Theatr. Fr. p. 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dit 1742.</NOTE>. Hugues de Bercy, a French monk, wrote in the twelfth cen∣tury a very lively and severe satire; in which no person, not even himself, was spared, and which he called the BIBLE, as containing nothing but truth <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">See Fauchett, Rec. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Harleian manuscripts I find an ancient French poem, yet respecting England, which is a humorous pane∣gyric on a new religious order called LE ORDRE DE BEL EYSE. This is the exordium.</P>
<Q><L>Qui vodra a moi entendre</L>
<L>Oyr purra e aprendre</L>
<L>L'estoyre de un ORDRE NOVEL</L>
<L>Qe mout est delitous bel.</L></Q>
<P>The poet ingeniously feigns, that his new monastic order consists of the most eminent nobility and gentry of both sexes, who inhabit the monasteries assigned to it promiscu∣ously; and that no person is excluded from this establish∣ment who can support the rank of a gentleman. They are bound by their statutes to live in perpetual idleness and lux∣ury: and the satyrist refers them for a pattern or rule of prac∣tice in these important articles, to the monasteries of Sem∣pringham in Lincolnshire, Beverley in Yorkshire, the Knights Hospitalers, and many other religious orders then flourish∣ing in England <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">MSS. ibid. f. 121.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>When we consider the feudal manners, and the magnifi∣cence of our Norman ancestors, their love of military glory, the enthusiasm with which they engaged in the crusades, and the wonders to which they must have been familiarised from those eastern enterprises, we naturally suppose, what will hereafter be more particularly proved, that their retinues
<PB N="38" REF="203"/>
abounded with minstrels and harpers, and that their chief entertainment was to listen to the recital of romantic and martial adventures. But I have been much disappointed in my searches after the metrical tales which must have pre∣vailed in their times. Most of those old heroic songs are perished, together with the stately castles in whose halls they were sung. Yet they are not so totally lost as we may be apt to imagine. Many of them still partly exist in the old English metrical romances, which will be mentioned in their proper places; yet divested of their original form, polished in their style, adorned with new incidents, successively mo∣dernised by repeated transcription and recitation, and retain∣ing little more than the outlines of the original composition. This has not been the case of the legendary and other reli∣gious poems written soon after the conquest, manuscripts of which abound in our libraries. From the nature of their subject they were less popular and common; and being less frequently recited, became less liable to perpetual innovation or alteration.</P>
<P>The most antient English metrical romance which I can discover, is entitled the GESTE OF KING HORN. It was evi∣dently written after the crusades had begun, is mentioned by Chaucer <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rim. Thop. 3402. Urr.</NOTE>, and probably still remains in its original state. I will first give the substance of the story, and afterwards add some specimens of the composition. But I must premise, that this story occurs in very old French metre in the manu∣scripts of the British Museum <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 527. b. f. 59. Cod. membr.</NOTE>, so that probably it is a translation: a circumstance which will throw light on an argument pursued hereafter, proving that most of our me∣trical romances are translated from the French.</P>
<P>Mury, king of the Saracens, lands in the kingdom of Sud∣dene, where he kills the king named Allof. The queen, Godylt, escapes; but Mury seizes on her son Horne, a beautiful
<PB N="39" REF="204"/>
youth aged fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teen years, and puts him into a galley, with two of his play-fellows, Achulph and Fykenyld: the vessel being driven on the coast of the kingdom of West∣nesse, the young prince is found by Aylmar king of that country, brought to court, and delivered to Athelbrus his steward, to be educated in hawking, harping, tilting, and other courtly accomplishments. Here the princess Rymenild falls in love with him, declares her passion, and is betrothed. Horne, in consequence of this engagement, leaves the princess for seven years; to demonstrate, according to the ritual of chivalry, that by seeking and accomplishing dan∣gerous enterprises he deserved her affection. He proves a most valorous and invincible knight: and at the end of seven years, having killed king Mury, recovered his father's king∣dom, and atchieved many signal exploits, recovers the prin∣cess Rymenild from the hands of his treacherous knight and companion Fykenyld; carries her in triumph to his own country, and there reigns with her in great splendor and prosperity. The poem itself begins and proceeds thus:</P>

<P>It is the force of the story in these pieces that chiefly en∣gages our attention. The minstrels had no idea of conduct∣ing and describing a delicate situation. The general manners were gross, and the arts of writing unknown. Yet this simplicity sometimes pleases more than the most artificial touches. In the mean time, the pictures of antient manners presented by these early writers, strongly interest the ima∣gination: especially as having the same uncommon merit with the pictures of manners in Homer, that of being founded in truth and reality, and actually painted from the life. To talk of the grossness and absurdity of such manners is little to the purpose; the poet is only concerned in the justness and faithfulness of the representation.</P>

<P>HITHERTO we have been engaged in examining the state of our poetry from the conquest to the year 1200, or rather afterwards. It will appear to have made no very rapid improvement from that period. Yet as we proceed, we shall find the language losing much of its antient barba∣rism and obscurity, and approaching more nearly to the dialect of modern times.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the reign of Henry the third, a poem occurs, the date of which may be determined with some degree of certainty. It is a satirical song, or ballad, written by one of the adherents of Simon de Montfort earl of Lei∣cester, a powerful baron, soon after the battle of Lewes, which was fought in the year 1264, and proved very fatal to the interests of the king. In this decisive action, Richard king of the Romans, his brother Henry the third, and prince Edward, with many others of the royal party, were taken prisoners.</P>

<P>These popular rhymes had probably no small influence in encouraging Leicester's partisans, and diffusing his fc∣tion.

<P>A learned and ingenious writer, in a work which places the study of the law in a new light, and proves it to be an entertaining history of manners, has observed, that this ballad on Richard of Alemaigne probably occasioned a statute against libels in the year 1275, under the title, <Q REND="inline">"Against slanderous reports, or tales to cause discord betwixt king and people <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">OBSERVATIONS UPON THE STA∣TUTES, CHIEFLY THE MORE ANCIENT, &amp;c. edit. 1766. p. 71.</NOTE>."</Q> That this spirit was growing to an extra∣vagance which deserved to be checked, we shall have occasion to bring further proofs.</P>

And although this poet was a Frenchman, and most probably wrote in French, yet this first instance of an officer who was afterwards, yet with sufficient impropriety, denominated a <HI>poet laureate</HI> in the English court, deservedly claims particular notice in the course of these annals.

<P>The first poet whose name occurs in the reign of Edward the first, and indeed in these annals, is Robert of Glocester, a monk of the abbey of Glocester. He has left a poem o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerable length, which is a history of England in verse, from Brutus to the reign of Edward the first. It was evi∣dently written after the year 1278, as the poet mentions king Arthur's sumptuous tomb, erected in that year before the high altar of Glastenbury church <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Pag. 224. edit. Hearne. Oxon. 1724.</NOTE>: and he declares him∣self a living witness of the rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kably dismal weather which distinguished the day on which the battle of Evesham above∣mentioned was fought, in the year 1265 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Pag. 560.</NOTE>. From these and other circumstances this piece appears to have been composed about the year 1280. It is exhibited in the manuscripts, is cited by many antiquaries, and printed by Hearne, in the Alexandrine measure: but with equal probability might have been written in four-lined stanzas. This rhyming chronicle is totally destitute of art or imagination. The author has cloathed the fables of Geoffrey of Monmouth in rhyme, which have often a more poetical air in Geoffrey's prose. The
<PB N="49" REF="214"/>
language is not much more easy or intelligible than that of many of the Norman Saxon poems quoted in the preceding sec∣tion: it is full of Saxonisms, which indeed abound, more or less, in every writer before Gower and Chaucer. But this ob∣scurity is perhaps owing to the western dialect, in which our monk of Glocester was educated. Provincial barbarisms are naturally the growth of extreme counties, and of such as are situated at a distance from the metropolis: and it is probable, that the Saxon heptarchy, which consisted of a cluster of seven independent states, contributed to produce as many different provincial dialects. In the mean time it is to be considered, that writers of all ages and languages have their affectations and singularities, which occasion in each a peculiar phraseology.</P>

<P>That is, <Q REND="inline">"This cruel giant yelled so horribly, and so vehe∣ment was his fall, that he fell down like an oak cut through at the bottom, and all the hill shook while he fell."</Q> But this stroke is copied from Geoffry of Monmouth; who tells the same miraculous story, and in all the pomp with which it was perhaps dressed up by his favourite fablers. <Q REND="inline">"Exclamavit vero invisus ille; et velut quercus ventorum viribus eradi∣cata, cum maximo sonitu corruit."</Q> It is difficult to determine which is most blameable, the poetical historian, or the pro∣saic poet.</P>

That Stone∣henge is a British monument, erected in memory of Hengist's ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acre, rests, I be∣lieve, on the sole evidence of Geoffry of Monmouth, who had it from the British bards. But why should not the testimony of the British bards be allowed on this oc∣casion? For they did not invent facts, so much as fables. In the present case, Hen∣gist's massacre in an allowed event. Re∣move all the apparent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iction, and the bards only say, that an immense pile of stones was raised on the plain of Ambresbury in memory of that event. They lived too near the time to forge this origin of Stone∣henge. The whole story was recent, and from the immensity of the work itself, must have been still more notorious. Therefore their forgery would have been too glaring. It may be objected, that they were fond of re∣ferring every thing stupendous to their fa∣vourite hero Arthur. This I grant: but not when known authenticated facts stood in their way, and while the real cause was remembered. Even to this day, the mas∣sacre of Hengist, as I have partly hinted, is an undisputed piece of history. Why should not the other part of the story be equally true? Besides the silence of Nennius, I am aware, that this hypothesis is still at∣tended with many difficulties and impro∣babilities. And so are all the systems and conjectures ever yet framed about this amazing monument. It appears to me, to be the work of a rude people who had some ideas of art: such as we may suppose the Romans left behind them among the Bri∣tons. In the mean time I do not remem∣ber, that in the very controverted etymolo∣gy of the word <HI>Stone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enge</HI> the name of HEN∣GIST has been properly or sufficiently con∣sidered.</NOTE>.</L></Q>

It appears from this and previous instances, that political bal∣lads, I mean such as were the vehicles of political satire, prevailed much among our early ancestors. About the pre∣sent era, we meet with a ballad complaining of the exhor∣bitant fees extorted, and the numerous taxes levied, by the king's officers <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 64. There is a song half Latin and half French, much on the same subject. Ibid. f. 137. b.</NOTE>. There is a libel remaining, written indeed in French Alexandrines, on the commission of trayl-baston <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See Spelman and Dufresne in Voc. And Rob. Brunne's Chron. ed. Hearne, p. 328.</NOTE>, or the justices so denominated by Edward the first, during his absence in the French and Scotch wars, about the year 1306. The author names some of the justices or commis∣sioners, now not easily discoverable: and says, that he served the king both in peace and war in Flanders, Gascony, and Scotland <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. ibid. f. 113. b.</NOTE>. There is likewise a ballad against the Scots, trai∣tors to Edward the first, and taken prisoners at the battles of Dunbar and Kykenclef, in 1305, and 1306 <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. f. 59.</NOTE>. The licen∣tiousness of their rude manners was perpetually breaking out in these popular pasquins, although this species of pe∣tulance usually belongs to more polished times.</P>
<P>Nor were they less dexterous than daring in publishing their satires to advantage, although they did not enjoy the many conveniencies which modern improvements have afforded for the circulation of public abuse. In the reign of Henry the sixth, to pursue the topic a little lower, we find a ballad of this species stuck on the gates of the royal palace, severely reflecting on the king and his counsellors then sitting in par∣liament. This piece is preserved in the Ashmolean museum, with the following Latin title prefixed. <Q>"Copia scedul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e valvis domini regis existentis in parliamento suo tento apud Westmonas∣terium mense marcii anno regni Henrici sexti vicesimo octavo."</Q> But the antient ballad was often applied to better purposes: and it appears from a valuable collection of these little pieces,
<PB N="59" REF="224"/>
lately published by my ingenious friend and fellow-labourer doctor Percy, in how much more ingenuous a strain they have transmitted to posterity the praises of knightly he∣roism, the marvels of romantic fiction, and the complaints of love.</P>
<P>At the close of the reign of Edward the first, and in the year 1303, a poet occurs named Robert Mannyng, but more commonly called Robert de Brunne. He was a Gilbertine monk in the monastery of Brunne, or Bourne, near Depyng in Lincolnshire: but he had been before professed in the priory of Sixhille, a house of the same order, and in the same county. He was merely a translator. He translated into English metre, or rather paraphrased, a French book, written by Grosthead bishop of Lincoln, entitled, MANUEL PECHE, or MANUEL de PECHE, that is, the MANUAL OF SINS. This translation was never printed <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">MSS. Bibl. Bodl. N. 415. membr. fol. Cont. 80. pag. Pr.<Q> "Fadyr and sone and holy goste." </Q>And MSS. Harl. 1701.</NOTE>. It is a long work, and treats of the decalogue, and the seven deadly sins, which are illustrated with many legendary stories. This is the title of the translator. <Q REND="inline">"Here bygynneth the boke that men clepyn in Frenshe MANUEL PECHE, the which boke made yn Frenshe Robert Groosteste byshop of Lyncoln."</Q> From the Prologue, among other circumstances, it appears that Robert de Brunne designed this performance to be sung to the harp at public entertainments, and that it was written or begun in the year 1303 <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fol. 1. a.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>But Robert de Brunne's largest work is a metrical chro∣nicle of England <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The second part was printed by Hearne at Oxford, which he calls PETER LANG∣TOFT'S CHRONICLE, 1725. Of the First part Hearne has given us the Prologue, Pref. p. 96. An Extract, ibid. p. 188. And a few other passages in his Glossary to Robert of Gloucester.

It appears that our author was educated and graduated at Cambridge, from Chron. p. 337.</NOTE>.

It is esteemed one of the oldest of the French romances; and begun to be written by Eustace, sometimes called Eustache, Wistace, or Huistace, who finished his part under the title of BRUT D'ANGLETERRE, in the year 1155. Hence Robert de Brunne, somewhat in∣accurately, calls it simply the BRUT <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The BRUT OF ENGLAND, a prose Chronicle of England, sometimes continued as low as Henry the sixth, is a common ma∣nuscript. It was at first translated from a French Chronicle [MSS. Harl. 200. 4to.] written in the beginning of the reign of Edward the third. I think it is printed by Caxton under the title of <HI>Fructus Temporum.</HI> The French have a famous ancient prose romance called BRUT, which includes the history of the Sangreal.

soon afterwards continued to William Rufus, by Robert Wace or Vace, Gasse or Gace, a native of Jersey, educated at Caen, canon of Bayeux, and chaplain to Henry the second, under the title of LE ROMAN LE ROU ET LES VIES DES DUCS DE NORMANDIE, yet sometimes preserving its original one, in the year 1160 <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Lenglet, Biblioth. des Romans, ii. p. 226. 227.

In the Cotton library, a Saxo-norman manuscript occurs twice, which seems to be a translation of Geoffry's History, or very like it. Calig. A. ix. And Otho. C. 13. 4to. In vellum. The translator is one Lazamon, a priest, born at Ernly on Severn. He says, that he had his original from the book of a French clergyman, named <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;</HI> which book <HI>Wate</HI> the author, had presented to Eleanor, queen of Henry the second.

Whereas Lazamon un∣doubtedly means Wace, perhaps written or called Wate, author of LE ROMAN LE ROU above-mentioned. Nor is the Saxon t [t] perfectly distinguishable from c. See Wanley's Catal.

Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough this romance, in its antient and early manu∣scripts, has constantly passed under the name of its finisher, Wace; yet the accurate Fauchett cites it by the name of its first author Eustace <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rec. p. 82. edit. 1581.</NOTE>. And at the same time it is extraor∣dinary, that Robert de Brunne, in his Prologue, should not once mention the name of Eustace, as having any concern in it: so soon was the name of the beginner superseded by that of the continuator. An ingenious French antiquary very justly supposes, that Wace took many of his descrip∣tions from that invaluable and singular monument the <HI>Tapestry of the Norman conquest,</HI> preserved in the treasury of the ca∣thedral of Bayeux <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mons.

<P>I am of opinion, that some of the great military battering engines, so frequently mentioned in the histories and other writers of the dark ages, were fetched from the crusades.

These expeditions into the east undoubtedly much improved the European art of war. Tasso's warlike machines, which seem to be the poet's invention, are formed on descriptions of such wonderful machines which he had read in the crusade historians, particularly Wilhelmus Tyrensis.</P></NOTE>,</L>

<P>From these passages it appears, that Robert of Brunne has scarcely more poetry than Robert of Glocester. He has however taken care to acquaint his readers, that he avoided

high description, and that sort of phraseology which was then used by the minstrels and harpers: that he rather aimed to give information than pleasure, and that he was more studious of truth than ornament. As he intended his chronicle to be sung, at least by parts, at public festivals, he found it expedient to apologise for these deficiencies in the prologue; as he had partly done before in his prologue to the MANUAL OF SINS.</P>

<P>Erceldoune and Kendale are mentioned, in some of these lines of Brunne, as old romances or popular tales. Of the latter I can discover no traces in our antient literature.

In the British Museum a manuscript English poem occurs, with this French title prefixed, <Q REND="inline">"La Countesse de Dunbar, demanda a Thomas Essedoune quant la guere d' Escoce prendret fyn <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 2253. f. 127. It begins thus,
<Q><L>When man as mad a kingge of a capped man</L>

One of his predictions is mentioned in an antient Scots poem entitled, A NEW YEAR'S GIFT, writ∣ten in the year 1562, by Alexander Scott <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ancient Scots poems, Edinb. 1770. 12mo. p. 194. See the ingenious editor's notes, p. 312.</NOTE>. One Thomas Leirmouth, or Rymer, was also a prophetic bard, and lived at Erslingtoun, sometimes perhaps pronounced Erseldoun.

This is therefore probably the same person. One who per∣sonates him, says,

It was undoubtedly a great impediment to the cultivation and progressive improvement of the English language at these early periods, that the best authors chose to write in French. Many of Robert Grosthead's pieces are indeed in Latin; yet where the subject was popular, and not imme∣diately addressed to learned readers, he adopted the Romance or French language, in preference to his native English. Of this, as we have already seen, his MANUEL PECHE, and his CHATEAU D' AMOUR, are sufficient proofs, both in prose and verse: and his example and authority must have had consi∣derable influence in encouraging this practice. Peter Lang∣toft, our Augustine canon of Bridlington, not only compiled the large chronicle of England, above recited, in French; but even translated Herbert Boscam's Latin Life of Thomas of Beckett into French rhymes <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pits. p. 890.

<P>In the same manuscript I find a French poem probably written by an Englishman, and in the year 1300, containing the adven∣tures of Gilote and Johanne, two ladies of gallantry, in various parts of England and Ireland; particularly at Winchester and Pontefract. f. 66. b. The curious reader is also referred to a French poem, in which the poet supposes that a minstrel, <HI>jugleour,</HI> travelling from London, cloathed in a rich tabard, met the king and his retinue. The king asks him many questions; particularly his lord's name, and the price of his horse. The minstrel evades all the king's questions by impertinent answers; and at last pre∣sumes to give his majesty advice. Ibid. f. 107. b.</P></NOTE>. Yet this fashion proceeded rather from necessity and a principle of convenience, than from affectation. The vernacular English, as I have before remarked, was rough and unpolished: and al∣though these writers possessed but few ideas of taste and ele∣gance, they embraced a foreign tongue, almost equally familiar, and in which they could convey their sentiments with greater ease, grace, and propriety. It should also be considered, that our most eminent scholars received a part of their education at the university of Paris. Another, and a very material circ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣stance, concurred to countenance this fashionable practice of composing in French. It procured them readers of rank and distinction. The English court, for more than two hundred years after the conquest, was totally French: and our kings, either from birth, kindred, or marriage, and from a perpe∣tual intercourse, seem to have been more closely connected with France than with England. It was however fortunate that these French pieces were written, as some of them met
<PB N="87" REF="252"/>
with their translators: who perhaps unable to aspire to the praise of original writers, at least by this means contributed to adorn their native tongue: and who very probably would not have written at all, had not original writers, I mean their cotemporaries who wrote in French, furnished them with models and materials.</P>
<P>Hearne, to whose diligence even the poetical antiquarian is much obliged, but whose conjectures are generally wrong, imagines, that the old English metrical romance, called RY∣CHARDE CUER DE LYON, was written by Robert de Brunne. It is at least probable, that the leisure of monastic life pro∣duced many rhymers. From proofs here given we may fairly conclude, that the monks often wrote for the minstrels: and although our Gilbertine brother of Brunne chose to relate true stories in plain language, yet it is reasonable to suppose, that many of our antient tales in verse containing fictitious adventures, were written, although not invented, in the reli∣gious houses. The romantic history of <HI>Guy earl of Warwick,</HI> is expressly said, on good authority, to have been written by Walter of Exeter, a Franciscan Friar of Carocus in Cornwall, about the year 1292 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Carew's Surv.

<P>As to the <HI>Mirabilia Mundi,</HI> mentioned in the statutes of New College at Oxford, in conjunction with these <HI>Poemata</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="266"/>
and <HI>Regnorum Chronicae,</HI> the immigrations of the Arabians into Europe and the crusades produced numberless accounts, partly true and partly fabulous, of the wonders seen in the eastern countries; which falling into the hands of the monks, grew into various treatises, under the title of <HI>Mira∣bilia Mundi.</HI> There were also some professed travellers into the East in the dark ages, who surprised the western world with their marvellous narratives, which could they have been contradicted would have been believed <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The first European traveller who went far Eastward, is Benjamin a Jew of Tude∣la in Navarre. He penetrated from Con∣stantinople through Alexandria in Aegypt and Persia to the frontiers of Tzin, now China. His travels end in 1173. He mentions the immense wealth of Constan∣tinople; and says that its port swarmed with ships from all countries. He exag∣gerates in speaking of the prodigious num∣ber of Jews in that city. He is full of marvellous and romantic stories. William de Rubruquis, a monk, was sent into Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic Tartary, and by the command of S. Louis king of France, about the year 1245. As was also Carpini, by Pope Innocent the fourth. Their books abound with im∣probabilities. Marco Polo a Venetian no∣bleman travelled eastward into Syria and Persia to the country constantly called in the dark ages Cathay, which proves to be the northern part of China. This was about the year 1260. His book is entitled <HI>De R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gionibus Ori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntis.</HI> He mentions the im∣mense and opulent city of Cambalu, un∣doubtedly Pekin. Hakluyt cites a friar; named Oderick, who travelled to Cambalu in Cathay, and whose description of that city corresponds exactly with Pekin. Friar Bacon about 1280, from these travels form∣ed his geography of this part of the globe, as may be collected from what he relates of the Tartars. See Purchas Pilgr. iii. 52. And Bac. Op. Maj. 228. 235.</NOTE>. At the court of the grand Khan, persons of all nations and religions, if they discovered any distinguished degree of abilities, were kindly entertained and often preferred..</P>
<P>In the Bodleian library we have a superb vellum manu∣script, decorated with antient descriptive paintings and illu∣minations, entitled, <HI>Histoire de Graunt Kaan et des</HI> MERVEILLES DU MONDE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">MSS. Bodl. F. 10. fol. praegrand. ad calc. Cod. The hand-writing is about the reign of Edward the third. I am not sure whether it is not Mandeville's book.</NOTE>.

This was Frederick Barbarossa, emperor of Ger∣many, or his successor; both of whom were celebrated for their many successful enterprises in the holy land, before the year 1230. Prester John, a christian, was emperor of India. I find another tract, DE MIRABILIBUS <HI>Terrae Sanctae</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">MSS. Reg. 14 C. xiii. 3.</NOTE>.

His Itinerary might indeed have the same title <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">His book is supposed to have been in∣terpolated by the monks. Leland observes, that Asia and Africa were parts of the world at this time, <Q REND="inline">"Anglis de sola fere nomi∣nis umbra cognitas."</Q> Script. Br. p. 366. He wrote his Itinerary in French, English, and Latin. It extends to Cathay, or Chi∣na, before mentioned. Leland says, that he gave to Beckett's shrine in Canterbury cathedral a glass globe enclosing an apple, which he probably brought from the east. Leland saw this curiosity, in which the ap∣ple remained fresh and undecayed. Ubi supr. Maundeville, on returning from his travels, gave to the high altar of S. Alban's abbey church a sort of Patera brought from Aegypt, now in the hands of an ingenious antiquary in London. He was a native of the town of S. Alban's, and a physician. He says that he left many MERVAYLES unwritten; and refers the curious reader to his MAPPA MUNDI, chap. cviii. cix. A history of the Tartars became popular in Europe about the year 1310, written or dic∣tated by Aiton a king of Armenia, who having traversed the most remarkable coun∣tries of the east, turned monk at Cyprus, and published his travels; which, on ac∣count of the rank of the author, and his amazing adventures, gained great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</NOTE>.

<P>That the pope should here pronounce the funeral pane∣gyric of Edward the first, is by no means surprising, if we consider the predominant ideas of the age. And in the true spirit of these ideas, the poet makes this illustrious monarch's atchievements in the holy land, his principal and leading topic. But there is a particular circumstance alluded to in
<PB N="108" REF="273"/>
these stanzas, relating to the crusading character of Edward, together with its consequences, which needs explanation. Edward, in the decline of life, had vowed a second expedi∣tion to Jerusalem: but finding his end approach, in his last moments he devoted the prodigious sum of thirty thousand pounds to provide one hundred and forty knights <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">The poet says eighty.</NOTE>, who should carry his heart into Palestine. But this appointment of the dying king was never executed. Our elegist, and the chroniclers, impute the crime of witholding so pious a legacy to the advice of the king of France, whose daughter Isabel was married to the succeeding king. But it is more probable to suppose, that Edward the second, and his profligate mi∣nion Piers Gaveston, dissipated the money in their luxurious and expensive pleasures.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>WE have seen, in the preceding section, that the cha∣racter of our poetical composition began to be changed about the reign of the first Edward: that either fictitious adventures were substituted by the minstrels in the place of historical and traditionary facts, or reality disguised by the misrepresentations of invention; and that a taste for ornamental and even exotic expression gradually prevailed over the rude simplicity of the native English phraseology. This change, which with our language affected our poetry, had been growing for some time; and among other causes was occasioned by the introduction and increase of the tales of chivalry.</P>
<P>The ideas of chivalry, in an imperfect degree, had been of old established among the Gothic tribes. The fashion of challenging to single combat, the pride of se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king dangerous adventures, and the spirit of avenging and protecting the fair sex, seem to have been peculiar to the northern nations in the most uncultivated state of Europe. All these customs were afterwards encouraged and confirmed by corresponding circumstances in the feudal constitution. At length the crusades excited a new spirit of enterprise, and introduced into the courts and ceremonies of European princes a higher degree of splendor and parade, caught from the riches and magnificence of eastern cities <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I cannot help transcribing here a cu∣rious passage from old Fauchett. He is speaking of Louis the young, king of France about the year 1150. <Q REND="inline">"Le quel fut le premier roy de sa maison, qui monstra dehors ses richesses allant en Je∣rusalem.

<PB N="110" REF="275"/>
established a taste for hyperbolical description, and propagated an infinity of marvellous tales, which men returning from distant countries easily imposed on credulous and ignorant minds. The unparalleled emulation with which the nations of christendom universally embraced this holy cause, the pride with which emperors, kings, barons, earls, bishops, and knights strove to excel each other on this interesting occasion, not only in prowess and heroism, but in sumptuous equipages, gorgeous banners, armorial cognisances, splendid pavilions, and other expensive articles of a similar nature, diffused a love of war, and a fondness for military pomp. Hence their very diversions became warlike, and the martial enthusiasm of the times appeared in tilts and tournaments. These practices and opinions co-operated with the kindred superstitions of dragons <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Kircher's Mund. Subterran. viii. § 4. He mentions a knight of Rhodes made grand master of the order for killing a dra∣gon, 1345.</NOTE>, dwarfs, fairies, giants, and en∣chanters, which the traditions of the Gothic scalders had already planted; and produced that extraordinary species of composition which has been called ROMANCE.</P>
<P>Before these expeditions into the east became fashionable, the principal and leading subjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king Arthur with his knights of the round table, and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers. But in the romances written after the holy war, a new set of champions, of conquests and of countries, were intro∣duced. Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles, and Godfrey of Bulloigne, Solyman, Nouraddin, the caliphs, the soul∣dans, and the cities of Aegypt and Syria, became the favou∣rite topics. The troubadours of Provence, an idle and un∣settled race of men, took up arms, and followed their barons

in prodigious multitudes to the conquest of Jerusalem. They made a considerable part of the houshold of the nobility of France. Louis the seventh, king of France, not only en∣tertained them at his court very liberally, but commanded a considerable company of them into his retinue, when he took ship for Palestine, that they might solace him with their songs during the dangers and inconveniencies of so long a voyage <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Velley, Hist.

Many of the troubadours, whose works now exist, and whose names are recorded, accompa∣nied their lords to the holy war.

What a glory! The wor∣shipfull company of Merchant-taylors in London, if I recollect right, boast the names of many dukes, earls, and princes, enrolled in their community.

But poets can derive no lustre from counts, and dukes, or even princes, who have been enrolled in their lists; only in proportion as they have adorned the art by the excellence of their compositions.</NOTE>. Here a new and more copious source of fabling was opened: in these expeditions they picked up numberless extravagant stories, and at their return enriched romance with an infinite variety of oriental scenes and fictions.

<P>In the mean time we should recollect, that the Saracens or Arabians, the same people which were the object of the crusades, had acquired an establishm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt in Spain about the ninth century: and that by means of this earlier intercourse, many of their fictions and fables, together with their lite∣rature, must have been known in Europe before the chris∣tian armies invaded Asia. It is for this reason the elder Spanish romances have professedly more Arabian allusions than any other. Cervantes makes the imagined writer of

Yet exclusive of their domestic and more immediate connection with this eastern people, the Spaniards from temper and constitution were extravagantly fond of chivalrous exercises.

<P>It has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en imagined that the first romances were compos∣ed in metre, and sung to the harp by the poets of Provence at f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stival solemnities: but an ingenious Frenchman, who has made deep researches into this sort of literature, attempts to prove, that this mode of reciting romantic adventures was in high reputation among the natives of Normandy, above a century before the troubadours of Provence, who are ge∣nerally supposed to have led the way to the poets of Italy, Spain, and France, commenced about the year 1162 <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mons.

If the critic means to insinuate, that the French troubadours acquired their art of versifying from these Norman bards, this reasoning will favour the system of those, who contend that metrical romances lineally took their rise from the historical odes of the Scandinavian scalds: for the Normans were a branch of the Scandinavian stock. But Fauchett, at the same time that he allows the Normans to have been fond of chanting the praises of their heroes in verse, expressly <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><Q>"Ce que les Normans avoyent pris des François."</Q> Rec. liv. i. p. 70. edit. 1581.</NOTE>

<P>It is not my business, nor is it of much consequence, to discuss this obscure point, which properly belongs to the French antiquaries.

There is a curious story recorded by the French chroniclers, concerning Richard's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kill in the minstrel art, which I will here relate.—Richard, in his return from the crusade, was taken prisoner about the year 1193. A whole year elapsed before the English knew where their monarch was im∣prisoned. Blondell de Nesle, Richard's favourite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>instrel, resolved to find out his lord; and after travelling many days with∣out success, at last came to a castle where Richard was detained in custody. Here he found that the castle belonged to the duke of Austria, and that a king was there im∣prisoned. Suspecting that the prisoner was his master, he found means to place him∣self directly before a window of the cham∣ber where the king was kept; and in this situation began to sing a French chanson, which Richard and Blondell had formerly written together. When the king heard the song, he knew it was Blondell who sung it; and when Blondell paused after the first half of the song, the king began the other half and completed it. On this, Blondell returned home to England, and acquainted Richard's baro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with the place of his im∣prisonment, from which he was soon after∣wards released. See also Fauchett, Rec. p. 93. Richard lived long in Provence, where he acquired a taste for their poetry. The only relic of his sonnets is a small fragment in old French accurately cited by Mr. Walpole, and written during his cap∣tivity; in which he remonstrates to his men and barons of England, Normandy, Poic∣tiers, and Gascony, that they suffered him to remain so long a prisoner.

most early notice of a professed book of chivalry in England, as it should seem, appears under the reign of Henry the third; and is a curious and evident proof of the reputation and esteem in which this sort of composition was held at that period. In the revenue-roll of the twenty-first year of that king, there is an entry of the expence of silver clasps and studs for the king's great book of romances. This was in the year 1237. But I will give the article in its original dress. <Q REND="inline">"Et in firmaculis hapsis et clavis argenteis ad mag∣num librum ROMANCIS regis <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rot. Pip. an. 21.

<P>But not only the pieces of the French minstrels, written in French, were circulated in England about this time; but translations of these pieces were made into English, which containing much of the French idiom, together with a sort of poetical phraseology before unknown, produced various innovations in our style. These translations, it is probable, were enlarged with additions, or improved with alterations of the story. Hence it was that Robert de Brunne, as we have already seen, complained of <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>quaint</HI> English, of the changes made in the story of SIR TRISTRAM, and of the liberties assumed by his cotemporary minstrels in altering facts and coining new phrases. Yet these circumstances en∣riched our tongue, and extended the circle of our poetry. And for what reason these fables were so much admired and encouraged, in preference to the languid poetical chro∣nicles of Robert of Gloucester and Robert of Brunne, it is obvious to conjecture. The gallantries of chivalry were ex∣hibited with new splendour, and the times were growing more refined. The Norman fashions were adopted even in Wales. In the year 1176, a splendid carousal, after the manner of the Normans, was given by a Welsh prince. This was Rhees ap Gryffyth king of South Wales, who at Christmas made a great feast in the castle of Cardigan, then
<PB N="116" REF="281"/>

Fouquett de Marseilles had a beautiful person, a ready wit, and a talent for singing: these popular accomplishments recommended him to the courts of king Richard, Raymond count of Tholouse, and Beral de Baulx; where, as the French would say, <HI>il fit les delices de cour.</HI> He fell in love with Adelasia the wife of Beral, whom he cele∣brated in his songs. One of his poems is entitled, <HI>Las com∣planchas de Beral.</HI> On the death of all his lords, he received absolution for his sin of poetry, turned monk, and at length was made archbishop of Tholouse <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See Beauchamps, Recherch. Theatr. Fr. Paris, 1735. p. 7. 9. It was Jeffrey, Ri∣chard's brother, who patronised Jeffrey Ru∣dell, a famous troubadour of Provence, who is also celebrated by Petrarch. This poet had heard, from the adventurers in the crusades, the beauty of a countess of Tripoly highly extolled. He became en∣amoured from imagination: embarked for Tripoly, fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick in the voyage through the fever of expectation, and was brought on shore at Tripoly half expiring. The countess, having received the news of the arrival of this gallant stranger, hastened to the shore and took him by the hand. He opened his eyes; and at once overpowered by his disease and her kindness, had just time to say inarticulately, that <HI>having seen her he died satisfied.</HI> The countess made him a most splendid funeral, and erected to his memory a tomb of porphyry, inscribed with an epitaph in Arabian verse.

between both nations, probably became no less fashionable in France: especially if we take into the account the general popularity of Richard's character, his love of chivalry, his gallantry in the crusades, and the favours which he so libe∣rally conferred on the minstrels of that country. We have a romance now remaining in English rhyme, which cele∣brates the atchievements of this illustrious monarch. It is entitled RICHARD CUER DU LYON, and was probably trans∣lated from the French about the period above-mentioned. That it was, at least, translated from the French, appears from the Prologue.

<P>It is not improbable that both these rhyming chroniclers cite from the English translation: if so, we may fairly sup∣pose that this romance was translated in the reign of Ed∣ward the first, or his predecessor Henry the third.

Indeed the Arabian writer of the life of the sultan Saladin, mentions some exploits of Richard almost incredible. But, as lord Lyttelton justly observes, this historian is highly valuable on account of the knowledge he had of the facts which he relates. It is from this writer we learn, in the most authentic manner, the actions and negotiations of Richard in the course of the enterprise for the recovery of the holy land, and all the particulars of that memorable war <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Hist. of Hen. ii. vol. iv. p. 361.

Here, among others, some of the most capital and favou∣rite stories of romance are mentioned, Arthur, Charlemagne, the Siege of Troy with its appendages, and Alexander the Great: and there are four authors of high esteem in the dark ages, Geoffry of Monmouth, Turpin, Guido of Co∣lonna, and Callisthenes, whose books were the grand repo∣sitories of these subjects, and contained most of the tradi∣tionary fictions, whether of Arabian or classical origin, which constantly supplied materials to the writers of ro∣mance. I shall speak of these authors, with their subjects, distinctly.</P>
<P>But I do not mean to repeat here what has been already observed<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See Diss. i.</NOTE> concerning the writings of Geoffry of Monmouth and Turpin. It will be sufficient to say at present, that these two fabulous historians recorded the atchievements of Char∣lemagne and of Arthur: and that Turpin's history was artful∣ly forged under the name of that archbishop about the year 1110, with a design of giving countenance to the crusades from the example of so high an authority as Charlemagne, whose pretended visit to the holy sepulchre is described in the twentieth chapter.</P>
<P>As to the Siege of Troy, it appears that both Homer's poems were unknown, at least not understood in Europe, from the abolition of literature by the Goths in the fourth cen∣tury, to the fourteenth. Geoffry of Monmouth indeed, who wrote about the year 1160, a man of learning for that age, produces Homer in attestation of a fact asserted in his his∣tory: but in such a manner, as shews that he knew little more than Homer's name, and was but imperfectly ac∣quainted with Homer's subject. Geoffry says, that Brutus having ravaged the province of Acquitain with fire and sword, came to a place where the city of Tours now stands, <HI>as Homer testifies</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">L. i. ch. 14.</NOTE>. But the Trojan story was still kept alive
<PB N="125" REF="290"/>
in two Latin pieces, which passed under the names of Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis. Dares's history of the de∣struction of Troy, as it was called, pretended to have been translated from the Greek of Dares Phrygius into Latin prose by Cornelius Nepos, is a wretched performance, and forged under those specious names in the decline of Latin literature <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">In the Epistle prefixed, the pretended translator Nepos says, that he found this work at Athens, in the hand-writing of Dares. He adds, speaking of the controvert∣ed authenticity of Homer, <HI>De <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a re At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enis</HI> JUDICIUM <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit, cum pro insano Homerus haberetur quod deos cum hominibus belligerasse descrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it.</HI> In which words he does not refer to any public decree of the Athenian judges, but to Plato's opinion in his REPUBLIC. Dares, with Dictys Cretensis next men∣tioned in the text, was first printed at Mi∣lan in 1477. Mabillon says, that a manu∣script of the Pseudo-Dares occurs in the Laurentian library at Florence, upwards of eight hundred years old. Mus. Ital. i. p. 169. This work was abridged by Vincen∣tius Bellovacensis, a friar of Burgundy, about the year 1244. See his Specul. Histor. lib. iii. 63.</NOTE>. Dictys Cretensis is a prose Latin history of the Trojan war, in six books, paraphrased about the reign of Dioclesian or Constantine by one Septimius, from some Grecian history on the same subject, said to be discovered under a sepulchre by means of an earthquake in the city of Cnossus, about the time of Nero, and to have been composed by Dictys, a Cretan, and a soldier in the Trojan war. The fraud of discovering copies of books in this extraordinary manner, in order to infer from thence their high and indu∣bitable antiquity, so frequently practised, betrays itself. But that the present Latin Dictys had a Greek original, now lost, appears from the numerous grecisms with which it abounds: and from the literal correspondence of many pas∣sages with the Greek fragments of one Dictys cited by antient authors. The Greek original was very probably forged under the name of Dictys, a traditionary writer on the subject, in the reign of Nero, who is said to have been fond of the Trojan story <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">See Perizon. Dissertat. de Dict. Cretens. sect. xxix. Constantinus Lascaris, a learned monk of Constantinople, one of the restorers of Grecian literature in Europe near four hundred years ago, says that Dictys Cre∣tensis in Greek was lost. This writer is not once mentioned by Eustathius, who lived about the year 1170, in his elaborate and extensive commentary on Homer.</NOTE>. On the whole, the work appears to

At length Guido de Colonna, a native of Messina in Sicily, a learned civilian, and no con∣temptible Italian poet, about the year 1260, engrafting on Dares and Dictys many new romantic inventions, which the taste of his age dictated, and which the connection between Grecian and Gothic fiction easily admitted; at the same time comprehending in his plan the Theban and Argonautic stories from Ovid, Statius, and Valerius Flaccus <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Argonautics of Valerius Flaccus are cited in Chaucer's <HI>Hypsipile and Medea.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Let him reade the boke Argonauticon."</Q> v. 90.

Dares Phrygius and Dictys Cretensis seem to have been in some measure superseded by this improved and comprehensive history of the Grecian heroes: and from this period Achilles, Jason, and Hercules, were adopted into romance, and celebrated in common with Lancelot, Rowland, Gawain, Oliver, and other christian champions, whom they so nearly resembled in the extra∣vagance of their adventures <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bale says, that Edward the first, hav∣ing met with our author in Sicily, in re∣turning from Asia, invited him into Eng∣land, xiii. 36.

To this place also they supposed Odin to return after his death, where he was to receive those who died in battle, in a hall roofed with glitter∣ing shields. See Bartholin. L. ii. cap. 8. p. 402, 403. seq. This hall, says the Edda, is in the city of Asgard, which is called the <HI>Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld of Ida.</HI> Bartholin. ibid. In the very sublime ode on the Dissolution of the World, cited by Bartholine, it is said, that after the twilight of the gods should be ended, and the new world ap∣pear, <HI>the Asae shall meet in the field of Ida, and tell of the destroyed habitations.</HI> Barthol. L. ii. cap. 14. p. 597. Compare Arngrim. Jon. Crymog, l. i. c. 4. p. 45, 46. See also Edda, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ab. 5. In the proem to Rese∣nius's Edda, it is said, <Q REND="inline">"Odin appointed twelve judges or princes, at Sigtune in Scandinavia, as at TROY; and established there all the laws of TROY, and the customs of the TROJANS."</Q> See Hickes. Thesaur. i. Dissertat. Epist. p. 39. See also Mallett's Hist. Dannem. ii. p. 34. Bartholinus thinks, that the compiler of the Eddic mythology, who lived A. D. 1070, finding that the Britons and Francs drew their descent from Troy, was am∣bitious of assigning the same boasted origin to Odin. But this tradition appears to have been older than the Edda. And it is more probable, that the Britons and Francs borrowed it from the Scandinavian Goths, and adapted it to themselves; un∣less we suppose that these nations, I mean the former, were branches of the Gothic stem, which gave them a sort of inhe∣rent right to the claim. This reasoning may perhaps account for the early existence and extraordinary popularity of the Trojan story among nations ignorant and illiterate, who could only have received it by tradi∣tion. Geoffry of Monmouth took this de∣scent of the Britons from Troy, from the Welsh or Armoric bards, and they perhaps had it in common with the Scandinavian scalders. There is not a syllable of it in the authentic historians of England, who wrote before him; particularly those antient ones, Bede, Gildas, and the uninterpolated Nennius. Henry of Huntingdon began his history from <HI>Caesar;</HI> and it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s only on further information that he added <HI>Brute.</HI> But this information was from a manuscript found by him in his way to Rome in the abbey of Bec in Normandy, probably Geoffry's original. <HI>H. Hunt. Epistol. ad Warin.</HI> MSS. Cantabr. Bibl. publ. cod. 251. I have mentioned in another place, that Witlaf, a king of the West Saxons, grants in his charter, dated A. D. 833, among other things, to Croyland-abbey, his robe of tissue, on which was embroidered <HI>The Destruction of Troy.</HI> Obs. on Spenser's Fairy Queen, i. sect. v. p. 176. This proves the story to have been in high veneration even long before that period: and it should at the same time be remembered, that the Saxons came from Scandinavia.</P>
<P>This fable of the descent of the Britons from the Trojans was solemnly alledged as an authentic and undeniable proof in a controversy of great national importance, by Edward the first and his nobility, with∣out the least objection from the opposite party. It was in the famous dispute con∣cerning the subjection of the crown of England to that of Scotland, about the year 1301.

In some of the manuscripts of this piece which I have seen, there is an account of Alex∣ander's visit to the trees of the sun and moon: but I do not recollect this in the printed copies. Undoubtedly the original has had both interpolations and omissions. Pseudo-Gorionides above-mentioned seems to hint at the ground-work of this history of Alexander in the following passage. <Q>"Caeteras autem res ab Alexandro gestas, et egregia ejus facinora ac quaecunque demum perpetravit, ea in libris Medorum et Persarum, atque apud Nicolaum, Titum, et Strabonem; et in libris na∣tivitatis Alexandri, rerumque ab ipso gestarum, quos Magi ac Aegyptii eo anno quo Alexander decessit, composue∣runt, scripta reperies."</Q> <BIBL>Lib. ii. c. 12.—22.

The Arabian books abound with the most incredible fictions and traditions concerning Alexander the Great, which they probably borrowed and improved from the Persians. They call him Escander. If I recollect right, one of the miracles of this romance is our hero's horn. It is said, that Alexan∣der gave the signal to his whole army by a wonderful horn of immense magnitude, which might be heard at the dis∣tance of sixty miles, and that it was blown or sounded by sixty men at once <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">It is also in a manuscript entitled <HI>Secre∣tum Secretorum Aristotelis,</HI> Lib. 5. MSS. Bodl. D. 1. 5. This treatise, ascribed to Aristotle, was antiently in high repute. It is pretended to have been translated out of Greek into Arabic or Chaldee by one John a Spaniard; from thence into Latin by Phi∣lip a Frenchman; at length into English verse by Lidgate: under whom more will be said of it. I think the Latin is dedi∣cated to Theophina, a queen of Spain.</NOTE>. This is the horn which Orlando won from the giant Jatmund, and which, as Turpin and the Islandic bards report, was endued with magical power, and might be heard at the distance of twenty miles.

Berni, and Ariosto have all such a horn: and the fiction is here traced to its original source. But in speaking of the books which furnished the story of Alexander, I must not forget that Quintus Curtius was an admired historian of the romantic ages. He is quoted in the POLICRATICON of John of Salisbury, who died in the year 1181 <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">viii. 18.</NOTE>. Eneas Syl∣vius relates, that Alphonsus the ninth, king of Spain, in the thirteenth century, a great astronomer, endeavoured to re∣lieve himself from a tedious malady by reading the bible over fourteen times, with all the glosses; but not meeting with the expected success, he was cured by the consolation he received from once reading Quintus Curtius <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Op. p. 476.</NOTE>.

<P>The French, to resume the main tenour of our argument, had written metrical romances on most of these subjects, before or about the year 1200. Some of these seem to have

been formed from prose histories, enlarged and improved with new adventures and embellishments from earlier and more simple tales in verse on the same subject. Chrestien of Troys wrote <HI>Le Romans du Graal,</HI> or the adventures of the San∣grale, which included the deeds of king Arthur, Sir Tris∣tram, Lancelot du Lake, and the rest of the knights of the round table, before 1191.

<P>Oddegir the Dane makes a part of Charlemagne's his∣tory; and, I believe, is mentioned by archbishop Turpin.

MSS. ii. p. 1669.</NOTE>. To this subject, although almost equally belonging to that of Charlemagne, we may also refer a French romance in verse, written by Philipes Mousques, canon and chancellor of the church of Tournay. It is in fact, a chronicle of France: but the author, who does not chuse to begin quite so high as Adam and Eve, nor yet later than the Trojan war, opens his history with the rape of Helen, passes on to an ample description of the siege of Troy; and, through an exact detail of all the great events which succeeded, conducts his reader to the year 1240. This work comprehends all the fictions of Turpin's Char∣lemagne, with a variety of other extravagant stories dispersed in many professed romances. But it preserves numberless cu∣rious particulars, which throw considerable light on histo∣rical facts. Du Cange has collected from it all that concerns the French emperors of Constantinople, which he has printed at the end of his entertaining history of that city.</P>
<P>It was indeed the fashion for the historians of these times, to form such a general plan as would admit all the absur∣dities of popular tradition. Connection of parts, and uni∣formity of subject, were as little studied as truth. Ages of ignorance and superstition are more affected by the marvel∣lous than by plain facts; and believe what they find written, without discernment or examination. No man before the sixteenth century presumed to doubt that the Francs derived their o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igin from Francus, a son of Hector; that the Spa∣niards were descended from Japhet, the Britons from Brutus, and the Scotch from Fergus. Vincent de Beauvais, who lived under Louis the ninth of France, and who, on account of his extraordinary erudition, was appointed preceptor to that king's sons, very gravely classes archbishop Turpin's Char∣lemagne among the real histories, and places it on a level with Suetonius and Cesar. He was himself an historian,
<PB N="138" REF="303"/>
and has left a large history of the world, fraught with a variety of reading, and of high repute in the middle ages; but edifying and entertaining as this work might have been to his cotemporaries, at present it serves only to record their prejudices, and to characterise their credulity <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">He flourished about 1260.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hercules and Jason, as I have before hinted, were involved in the Trojan story by Guido de Colonna, and hence became familiar to the romance writers <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The TROJOMANNA SAGA, a Scandic manuscript at Stockholm, seems to be pos∣teriour to Guido's publication. It begins with Jason and Hercules, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyage to Colchos: proceeds to the rape of He∣len, and ends with the siege and destruc∣tion of Troy.

But one of the most valuable pieces of the old French poetry is on the subject of this victorious monarch, entitled, <HI>Roman d' Alexandre.</HI> It has been called the second poem now remaining in the French language, and was written about the year 1200. It was confessedly trans∣lated from the Latin; but it bears a nearer resemblance to Simeon Seth's romance, than to Quintus Curtius. It was the confederated performance of four writers, who, as Fau∣chett expresses himself, were <HI>associez en leur</HI> JONGLERIE <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fauchett, Rec. p. 83.</NOTE>. Lambert li Cors, a learned civilian, began the poem; and it was continued and completed by Alexander de Paris, John le Nivelois, and Peter de Saint Clost <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fauchett, ibid.

It has been supposed, that before the appearance of this poem, the <HI>Romans,</HI> or those pieces which celebrated GESTS, were constantly com∣posed in short verses of six or eight syllables: and that in this <HI>Roman d' Alexandre</HI> verses of twelve syllables were first used. It has therefore been imagined, that the verses called ALEXANDRINES, the present French heroic measure, took
<PB N="141" REF="306"/>
their rise from this poem; Alexander being the hero, and Alexander the chief of the four poets concerned in the work. That the name, some centuries afterwards, might take place in honour of this celebrated and early effort of French poetry, I think is very probable; but that verses of twelve syllables made their first appearance in this poem, is a doctrine which, to say no more, from examples already produced and examined, is at least ambiguous <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Pref. <HI>Le Roman de la Rose,</HI> par Mons.

The caliph is fre∣quently mentioned in this piece; and Alexander, like Char∣lemagne, has his twelve peers.</P>
<P>These were the four reigning stories of romance. On which perhaps English pieces, translated from the French, existed before or about the year 1300.

Bevis was a Saxon chieftain, who seems to have extended his dominion along the southern coasts of England, which he is said to have defended against the Norman invaders. He lived at Downton in Wiltshire. Near Southampton is an artificial hill called <HI>Bevis Mount,</HI> on which was probably a fortress <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">It is now inclosed in the beautiful gar∣dens of General Sir John Mordaunt, and gives name to his seat.</NOTE>. It is pretended that he was earl of Southampton. His sword is shewn in Arundel castle.

<P>GUY EARL OF WARWICK is recited as a French romance by Labbe <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ubi supr.</NOTE>. In the British Museum a metrical history in very old French appears, in which Felicia, or Felice, is called the

This Harold d'Arden is a distinguished warriour of Guy's history, and therefore his atchievements sometimes form a separate romance: as in the royal manuscripts of the British Museum, where we find <HI>Le Romant de Herolt Dardenne</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">15 E. vi. 8. fol.</NOTE>. In the English romance of Guy, mentioned at large in its proper place, this champion is called <HI>Syr Heraude of Arderne</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sign. L. ii. vers.</NOTE>.

This romance was composed, or perhaps enlarged, after the crusades; as we find, that Guy's redoubted encounters with Colbrond the Danish giant, with the monster of Dunsmore heath, and the dragon of Nor∣thumberland, are by no means equal to some of his at∣chievements in the holy land, and the trophies which he won from the soldan under the command of the emperor Fre∣derick.</P>
<P>The romance of SIDRAC, often entitled, <HI>Le Livere Sydrac le philosophe le quel hom appele le livere de le funtane de totes Sciences,</HI> appears to have been very popular, from the present frequency of its manuscripts. But it is rather a romance of Arabian philosophy than of chivalry. It is a system of natural knowledge, and particularly treats of the virtues of
<PB N="144" REF="309"/>
plants. Sidrac, the philosopher of this system, was astro∣nomer to an eastern king. He lived eight hundred and forty∣seven years after Noah, of whose book of astronomy he was possessed. He converts Bocchus, an idolatrous king of India, to the christian faith, by whom he is invited to build a mighty tower against the invasions of a rival king of India. But the history, no less than the subject of this piece, displays the state, nature, and migrations of literature in the dark ages. After the death of Bocchus, Sidrac's book fell into the hands of a Chaldean renowned for piety. It then successively becomes the property of king Madian, Namaan the Assyrian, and Grypho archbishop of Samaria. The latter had a priest named Demetrius, who brought it into Spain, and here it was translated from the Greek into Latin. This translation is said to be made at Toledo, by Roger de Palermo, a mino∣rite friar, in the thirteenth century. A king of Spain then commanded it to be translated from Latin into Arabic, and sent it as a most valuable present to Emir Elmomenim, lord of Tunis. It was next given to Frederick the Second, em∣peror of Germany, famous in the crusades. This work, which is of considerable length, was translated into English verse, and will be mentioned on that account again. Sidrac is recited as an eminent philosopher, with Seneca and king Solomon, in the <HI>Marchaunt's Second tale,</HI> ascribed to Chau∣cer <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Urr. p. 616. v. 1932.

<P>It is natural to conclude, that most of these French ro∣mances were current in England, either in the French ori∣ginals, which were well understood at least by the more polite readers, or else by translation or imitation, as I have before hinted, when the romance of <HI>Richard Cuer de Lyon,</HI> in whose prologue they are recited, was translated into English. That the latter was the case as to some of them,
<PB N="145" REF="310"/>
at least, we shall soon produce actual proofs. A writer, who has considered these matters with much penetration and judg∣ment, observes, that probably from the reign of our Richard the first, we are to date that remarkable intercommunica∣tion and mutual exchange of compositions which we discover to have taken place at some early period between the French and English minstrels. The same set of phrases, the same species of characters, incidents, and adventures, and often the identical stories, being found in the metrical romances of both nations <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Percy's Ess. on Anc. Engl. Minstr. p. 12.</NOTE>. From close connection and constant in∣tercourse, the traditions and the champions of one kingdom were equally known in the other: and although Bevis and Guy were English heroes, yet on these principles this cir∣cumstance by no means destroys the supposition, that their atchievements, although perhaps already celebrated in rude English songs, might be first wrought into romance by the French <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Dugdale relates, that in the reign of Henry the fourth, about the year 1410, a lord Beauchamp, travelling into the east, was hospitably received at Jerusalem by the Soldan's lieutenant: <Q REND="inline">"Who hearing that he was descended from the famous Guy of Warwick, <HI>whose story they had in books of their own language,</HI> invited him to his palace; and royally feasting him, pre∣sented him with three precious stones of great value, besides divers cloaths of silk and gold given to his servants."</Q> <BIBL>Baron. i. p. 243. col. 1.</BIBL> This story is delivered on the credit of John Rouse, the traveller's cotemporary. Yet it is not so very impro∣bable that Guy's history should be a book among the Saracens, if we consider, that Constantinople was not only a central and connecting point between the eastern and western world, but that the French in the thirteenth century had acquired an esta∣blishment there under Baldwin earl of Flan∣ders: that the French language must have been known in Sicily, Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Antioch, in consequence of the con∣quests of Robert Guiscard, Hugo le Grand, and Godfrey of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulloigne: and that pil∣grimages into the holy land were excessive∣ly frequent. It is hence easy to suppose, that the French imported many of their stories or books of this sort into the east; which being thus understood there, and suiting the genius of the orientals, were at length translated into their language. It is remarkable, that the Greeks at Constan∣tinople, in the twelfth century, and since, called all the Europeans by the name of Franks; as the Turks do to this day. See Seld. Polyolb. §. viii. p. 130.</NOTE>. And it seems probable, that we continued for some time this practice of borrowing from our neighbours.

<P>Various causes concurred, in the mean time, to multiply books of chivalry among the French, and to give them a superiority over the English, not only in the number but in the excellence of those compositions. Their barons lived in greater magnificence. Their feudal system flourished on a more sumptuous, extensive, and lasting establishment. Schools were instituted in their castles for initiating the young nobility in the rules and practice of chivalry. Their tilts and tournaments were celebrated with a higher degree of pomp; and their ideas of honour and gallantry were more exaggerated and refined.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="312"/>
We may add, what indeed has been before incidentally remarked, that their troubadours were the first writers of metrical romances. But by what has been here advanced, I do not mean to insinuate without any restrictions, that the French entirely led the way in these compositions. Un∣doubtedly the Provencial bards contributed much to the progress of Italian literature. Raimond the fourth of Ar∣ragon, count of Provence, about the year 1220, a lover and a judge of letters, invited to his court the most celebrated of the songsters who professed to polish and adorn the Pro∣vencial language by various sorts of poetry <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Giovan. Villani, Istor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. vi. c. 92.</NOTE>. Charles the first, his son-in-law, and the inheritor of his virtues and dignities, conquered Naples, and carried into Italy a taste for the Provencial literature. At Florence especially this taste prevailed, where he reigned many years with great splendour, and where his successors resided. Soon afterwards the Roman court was removed to Provence <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Villani acquaints us, that Brunetto Latini, Dante's master, was the first who at∣tempted to polish the Florentines by im∣proving their taste and style; which he did by writing his grand work the TESORO in Provencial. He died in 1294. See Villan. ibid. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. ix. c. 135.</NOTE>. Hitherto the Latin language had only been in use. The Provencial writers established a common dialect: and their examples convinced other nations, that the modern languages were no less adapted to composition than those of antiquity <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dante designed at first that his <HI>Inferno,</HI> and Treatise on monarchy, should appear in Latin. But finding that he could not so effectually in that language impress his sa∣tirical strokes and political maxims on the laity, or illiterate, he altered his mind, and published those pieces in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>talian. Had Petrarch written his <HI>Africa,</HI> his Eclogues, and his prose compositions in Italian, the li∣terature of his country would much sooner have arrived at perfection.</NOTE>. They introduced a love of reading, and diffused a general and popular taste for poetry, by writing in a language intelligible to the ladies and the people. Their verses being conveyed in a familiar tongue, became the chief amusement of princes and feudal lords, whose courts had now begun to assume an air of
<PB N="148" REF="313"/>
greater brilliancy: a circumstance which necessarily gave great encouragement to their profession, and by rendering these arts of ingenious entertainment universally fashionable, imperceptibly laid the foundation of polite literature. From these beginnings it were easy to trace the progress of poetry to its perfection, through John de Meun in France, Dante in Italy, and Chaucer in England.</P>
<P>This praise must undoubtedly be granted to the Provencial poets. But in the mean time, to recur to our original ar∣gument, we should be cautious of asserting in general and indiscriminating terms, that the Provencial poets were the first writers of metrical romance: at least we should ascer∣tain, with rather more precision than has been commonly used on this subject, how far they may claim this merit. I am of opinion that there were two sorts of French trou∣badours, who have not hitherto been sufficiently distin∣guished. If we diligently examine their history, we shall find that the poetry of the first troubadours consisted in satires, moral fables, allegories, and sentimental sonnets. So early as the year 1180, a tribunal called the <HI>Court of Love,</HI> was instituted both in Provence and Picardy, at which ques∣tions in gallantry were decided. This institution furnished eternal matter for the poets, who threw the claims and argu∣ments of the different parties into verse, in a style that afterwards led the way to the spiritual conversations of Cyrus and Clelia <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This part of their character will be insisted upon more at large when we come to speak of Chaucer.</NOTE>. Fontenelle does not scruple to acknowledge, that gallantry was the parent of French poetry <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Theatr. Fr. p. 13.</NOTE>. But to sing romantic and chivalrous adventures was a very different task, and required very different talents. The troubadours therefore who composed metrical romances form a different species, and ought always to be considered separately. And
<PB N="149" REF="314"/>
this latter class seems to have commenced at a later period, not till after the crusades had effected a great change in the manners and ideas of the western world. In the mean time, I hazard a conjecture. Cinthio Giraldi supposes, that the art of the troubadours, commonly called the <HI>Gay Science,</HI> was first communicated from France to the Italians, and after∣wards to the Spaniards <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Apud Huet, Orig. Rom. p. 108.</NOTE>. This perhaps may be true: but at the same time it is highly probable, as the Spaniards had their JUGLARES or convivial bards very early, as from long connection they were immediately and intimately acquaint∣ed with the fictions of the Ara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians, and as they were naturally fond of chivalry, that the troubadours of Provence in great measure caught this turn of fabling from Spain. The communication, to mention no other obvious means of intercourse in an affair of this nature, was easy through the ports of Toulon and Marseilles, by which the two na∣tions carried on from early times a constant commerce. Even the French critics themselves universally allow, that the Spaniards, having learned rhyme from the Arabians, through this very channel conveyed it to Provence. Tasso preferred <HI>Amadis de Gaul,</HI> a romance originally written in Spain, by Vasco Lobeyra, before the year 1300 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nic. Antonius, Bibl. Hispan. Vet. tom. ii. l. viii. c. 7. num. 291.</NOTE>, to the most celebrated pieces of the Provencial poets <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Disc. del Poem. Eroic. l. ii. p. 45. 46.</NOTE>. But this is a subject which will perhaps receive illustration from a writer of great taste, talents, and industry, Monsieur de la Curne de Sainte Palaye, who will soon oblige the world with an ample history of Provencial poetry; and whose researches into a kindred subject, already published, have opened a new and extensive field of information concerning the manners, institutions, and literature of the feudal ages <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Memoires sur l'ancienne Chevalerie,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS matters suggested by the Prologue of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON, cited in the last section, have betrayed us into a long digression, and interrupted the regularity of our annals. But I could not neglect so fair an opportunity of preparing the reader for those metrical tales, which having acquired a new cast of fiction from the cru∣sades and a magnificence of manners from the encrease of chivalry, now began to be greatly multiplied, and as it were professedly to form a separate species of poetry. I now therefore resume the series, and proceed to give some speci∣mens of the English metrical romances which appeared be∣fore or about the reign of Edward the second: and although most of these pieces continued to be sung by the minstrels in the halls of our magnificent ancestors for some centuries afterwards, yet as their first appearance may most probably be dated at this period, they properly coincide in this place with the tenour of our history. In the mean time, it is natural to suppose, that by frequent repetition and successive changes of language during many generations, their original simplicity must have been in some degree corrupted. Yet some of the specimens are extracted from manuscripts writ∣ten in the reign of Edward the third. Others indeed from printed copies, where the editors took great liberties in ac∣commodating the language to the times. However in such as may be supposed to have suffered most from depravations of this sort, the substance of the ancient style still remains, and at least the structure of the story. On the whole, we mean to give the reader an idea of those popular heroic tales in verse, professedly written for the harp, which began to be multiplied among us about the beginning of the fourteenth

century. We will begin with the romance of RICHARD CUEUR DE LYON, already mentioned.</P>
<P>The poem opens with the marriage of Richard's father, Henry the second, with the daughter of Carbarryne, a king of Antioch. But this is only a lady of romance. Henry mar∣ried Eleanor the divorced queen of Louis of France. The minstrels could not conceive any thing less than an eastern princess to be the mother of this magnanimous hero.</P>

This <HI>fyre grekys,</HI> or Grecian fire, seems to be a composi∣tion belonging to the Arabian chemistry. It is frequently mentioned by the Byzantine historians, and was very much used in the wars of the middle ages, both by sea and land. It was a sort of wild-fire, said to be inextinguishable by water, and chiefly used for burning ships, against which it was thrown in pots or phials by the hand. In land engagements it seems to have been discharged by machines constructed on purpose. The oriental Greeks pretended that this artificial fire was invented by Callinicus, an architect of Helio∣polis, under Constantine; and that Constantine prohi∣bited them from communicating the manner of making it to any foreign people. It was however in common use among the nations confederated with the Byzantines: and Anna Commena has given an account of its ingredients <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Du Cange, Not. ad Joinvil. p. 71. And Gl. Lat. V. IGNIS GRAECUS.</NOTE>, which were bitumen, sulphur, and naptha. It is called <HI>feu gregois</HI> in the French chronicles and romances. Our minstrell, I believe, is singular in saying that Richard scattered this fire on Saladin's ships: many monkish historians of the holy war, in describing the siege of Acon, relate that it was em¦ployed on that occasion, and many others, by the Saracens against the Christians <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See more particularly Chron.

It is an historical fact, that Richard was killed by the French from the shot of an arcubalist, a machine which he often worked skillfully with his own hands: and Guillaume le Briton, a Frenchman, in his Latin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poem called Philippeis, introduces Atropos making a decree, that Richard should die by no other means than by a wound from this destruc∣tive instrument; the use of which, after it had been inter∣dicted by the pope in the year 1139, he revived, and is supposed to have shewn the French in the crusades <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Carpentier's Suppl.

Joinville says, that the Greek fire thrown from a mortar looked like a huge dragon flying through the air, and that at midnight the flashes of it illu∣minated the christian camp, as if it had been broad day. When Louis's army was encamped on the banks of the Thanis in Aegypt, says the same curious historian, about the year 1249, they erected two <HI>chats chateil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> or covered galleries, to shel∣ter their workmen, and at the end of them two <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>frois,</HI> or vast moveable wooden towers, full of cross-bow men who kept a continual discharge on the opposite shore.

<P>Richard arming himself is a curious Gothic picture. It is certainly a genuine picture, and drawn with some spirit; as is the shock of the two necromantic steeds, and other parts of this description. The combat of Richard and the Soldan, on the event of which the christian army got possession of the city of Babylon, is probably the DUEL OF KING RICHARD, painted on the walls of a chamber in the royal palace of Clarendon <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 114.</NOTE>. The soldan is represented as meeting Richard with a hawk on his fist, to shew indifference, or a contempt of his adversary; and that he came rather prepared for the chace, than the combat. Indeed in the feudal times, and long afterwards, no gentleman appeared on horseback, unless going to battle, without a hawk on his fist. In the <HI>Tapestry of the Norman conquest,</HI> Harold is exhibited on horseback, with a hawk on his fist, and his dogs running before him, going on an embassy from king Edward the Confessor to William Duke of Normandy <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The hawk on the fist was a mark of great nobility. We frequently find it, upon antique seals and miniatures, attri∣buted to persons of both sexes. So sacred was this bird esteemed, that it was forbid∣den in a code of Charlemagne's laws, for any one to give his hawk or his sword as part of his ransom. <Q REND="inline">"In compositionem Wirigildi volumus ut ea dentur quae in lege continentur excepto <HI>accipitre et spatha.</HI>"</Q> Lindebrog.

This piece of sacrilege, indeed, was com∣mitted during service-time in the choir: and the hawk was the property of the bishop. Registr. Adami Orleton, Episc. Winton. fol. 56. b. In Archiv. Winton.

<P>As the minstrell profession became a science, and the au∣dience grew more civilised, refinements began to be
<PB N="182" REF="347"/>
studied, and the romantic poet sought to gain new attention, and to recommend his story, by giving it the advantage of a plan. Most of the old metrical romances are, from their nature, supposed to be incoherent rhapsodies. Yet many of them have a regular integrity, in which every part contri∣butes to produce an intended end. Through various obsta∣cles and difficulties one point is kept in view, till the final and general catastrophe is brought about by a pleasing and unexpected surprise. As a specimen of the rest, and as it lies in a narrow compass, I will develope the plan of the fable now before us, which preserves at least a coincidence of events, and an uniformity of design.</P>
<P>A king's daughter of England, extremely beautiful, is sol∣licited in marriage by numerous potentates of various king∣doms. The king her father vows, that of all these suitors, that champion alone shall win his daughter who can unhorse him at a tournament. This they all attempt, but in vain. The king every year assisted at an anniversary mass for the soul of his deceased queen, who was interred in an abbey at some distance from his castle. In the journey thither, the princess strays from her damsels in a solitary forest: she is discovered by a knight in rich armour, who by many sollici∣tations prevails over her chastity, and, at parting, gives her a sword without a point, which he charges her to keep safe; together with a pair of gloves, which will fit no hands but her own <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gloves were antiently a costly article of dress, and richly decorated. They were sometimes adorned with precious stones. Rot. Pip. an. 53. Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. iii. [A.

Et de ii. paribus chirothecarum cum LAPI∣DIBUS."</Q> This golden comb, set with jewels, realises the wonders of romance.</NOTE>. At length she finds the road to her father's castle, where, after some time, to avoid discovery, she is se∣cretly delivered of a boy. Soon after the delivery, the princess having carefully placed the child in a cradle, with twenty pounds in gold, ten pounds in silver, the gloves given her by the strange knight, and a letter, consigns him to one
<PB N="183" REF="348"/>
of her maidens, who carries him by night, and leaves him in a wood, near a hermitage, which she discerned by the light of the moon. The hermit in the morning discovers the child; reads the letter, by which it appears that the gloves will fit no lady but the boy's mother, educates him till he is twenty years of age, and at parting gives him the gloves found with him in the cradle, telling him that they will fit no lady but his own mother. The youth, who is called Degore, sets forward to seek adventures, and saves an earl from a terrible dragon, which he kills. The earl in∣vites him to his palace, dubs him a knight, gives him a horse and armour, and offers him half his territory. Sir Degore refuses to accept this offer, unless the gloves, which he had received from his foster-father the hermit, will fit any lady of his court. All the ladies of the earl's court are called before him, and among the rest the earl's daughter, but upon trial the gloves will fit none of them. He therefore takes leave of the earl, proceeds on his adventures, and meets with a large train of knights; he is informed that they were going to tourney with the king of England, who had promised his daughter to that knight who could conquer him in single combat. They tell him of the many barons and earls whom the king had foiled in several trials. Sir Degore, how∣ever, enters the lists, overthrows the king, and obtains the princess. As the knight is a perfect stranger, she submits to her father's commands with much reluctance. He marries her; but in the midst of the solemnities which preceded the consummation, recollects the gloves which the hermit had given him, and proposes to make an experiment with them on the hands of his bride. The princess, on seeing the gloves, changed colour, claimed them for her own, and drew them on with the greatest ease. She declares to Sir Degore that she was his mother, and gives him an account of his birth: she told him that the knight his father gave her a pointless sword, which was to be delivered to no person but the son
<PB N="184" REF="349"/>
that should be born of their stolen embraces. Sir Degore draws the sword, and contemplates its breadth and length with wonder: is suddenly seized with a desire of finding out his father. He sets forward on this search, and on his way enters a castle, where he is entertained at supper by fifteen beautiful damsels. The lady of the castle invites him to her bed, but in vain; and he is lulled asleep by the sound of a harp. Various artifices are used to divert him from his pur∣suit, and the lady even engages him to encounter a giant in her cause <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">All the romances have such an obstacle as this. They have all an enchantress, who detains the knight from his quest by objects of pleasure; and who is nothing more than the Calypso of Homer, the Dido of Virgil, and the Armida of Tasso.</NOTE>. But Sir Degore rejects all her temptations, and pursues his journey. In a forest he meets a knight richly accoutred, who demands the reason why Sir Degore presumed to enter his forest without permission. A combat ensues. In the midst of the contest, the combatants being both un∣horsed, the strange knight observing the sword of his ad∣versary not only to be remarkably long and broad, but with∣out a point, begs a truce for a moment. He fits the sword to a point which he had always kept, and which had for∣merly broken off in an encounter with a giant; and by this circumstance discovers Sir Degore to be his son. They both return into England, and Sir Degore's father is married to the princess his mother.</P>

They are then married, and the wedding is solemnised with a grand tournament, which they both view from a high tower. She is afterwards delivered of a son, which is so deformed as to be almost a monster. But at length she per∣suades the Soldan to turn christian; and the young prince is baptised, after which ceremony he suddenly becomes a child of most extraordinary beauty. The Soldan next pro∣ceeds to destroy his Saracen idols.</P>

<P>The Soldan then releases thirty thousand christians, whom he had long detained prisoners. As an apostate from the pagan religion, he is powerfully attacked by several neigh∣bouring Saracen nations: but he sollicits the assistance of his father in law the king of Tars; and they both joining their armies, in a pitched battle, defeat five Saracen kings, Kenedoch, Lesyas king of Taborie, Merkel, Cleomadas, and Membrok. There is a warmth of description in some pas∣sages of this poem, not unlike the manner of Chaucer. The reader must have already observed, that the stanza resembles that of Chaucer's RIME OF SIR TOPAS <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The romance of SIR LIBEAUX or LYBIUS DISCONIUS, quoted by Chaucer, is in this stanza.

IPOMEDON is mentioned among the romances in the Pro∣logue of RICHARD CUER DE LYON; which, in an antient copy of the British museum, is called SYR IPOMYDON: a name borrowed from the Theban war, and transferred here to a tale of the feudal times <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">MSS. Harl. 2252. 44. f. 54. And in the library of Lincoln cathedral, (K k. 3. 10.) is an ancient imperfect printed copy, wanting the first sheet.</NOTE>. This piece is evidently derived from a French original. Our hero Ippomedon is son of Ermones king of Apulia, and his mistress is the fair heiress of Calabria. About the year 1230, William Ferra∣bras <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Bras de fer. <HI>Iron arms.</HI></NOTE>, and his brethren, sons of Tancred the Norman, and well known in the romantic history of the Paladins, ac∣quired the signories of Apulia and Calabria.

<P>Ippomedon, although the son of a king, is introduced waiting in his father's hall, at a grand festival. This ser∣vitude was so far from being dishonourable, that it was al∣ways required as a preparatory step to knighthood <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See p. supr.</NOTE>.</P>

is neither my inclination nor intention to write a catalogue, or compile a miscellany. It is not to be expected that this work should be a general repository of our antient poetry. I cannot however help observing, that English literature and
<PB N="209" REF="374"/>
English poetry suffer, while so many pieces of this kind still remain concealed and forgotten in our manuscript libraries. They contain in common with the prose-romances, to most of which indeed they gave rise, amusing images of antient customs and institutions, not elsewhere to be found, or at least not otherwise so strikingly delineated: and they preserve pure and unmixed, those fables of chivalry which formed the taste and awakened the imagination of our elder English classics. The antiquaries of former times overlooked or re∣jected these valuable remains, which they despised as false and frivolous; and employed their industry in reviving ob∣scure fragments of uninstructive morality or uninteresting history. But in the present age we are beginning to make ample amends: in which the curiosity of the antiquarian is connected with taste and genius, and his researches tend to display the progress of human manners, and to illustrate the history of society.</P>
<P>As a further illustration of the general subject, and many particulars, of this section and the three last, I will add a new proof of the reverence in which such stories were held, and of the familiarity with which they must have been known, by our ancestors. These fables were not only perpetually repeated at their festivals, but were the constant objects of their eyes. The very walls of their apartments were clothed with ro∣mantic history. Tapestry was antiently the fashionable fur∣niture of our houses, and it was chiefly filled with lively representations of this sort. The stories of the tapestry in the royal palaces of Henry the eighth are still preserved <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q>"The seconde part of the Inventorye of our late sovereigne lord kyng Henry the eighth, conteynynge his guardrobes, hous∣hold-stuff, &amp;c. &amp;c."</Q> <BIBL>MSS.

He was canonised. Dugdale, among many other curious particulars re∣lating to his shrine, says, that in the year 1339 it was decorated anew, when three goldsmiths, two at the wages of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive shil∣lings by the week, and one at eight, worked upon it for a whole year.

<P>Edward the second is said to have carried with him to the siege of Stirling castle, in Scotland, a poet named Robert Baston. He was a Carmelite friar of Scarborough; and the king intended that Baston, being an eye-witness of the ex∣pedition, should celebrate his conquest of Scotland in verse. Hollingshead, an historian not often remarkable for pene∣tration, mentions this circumstance as a singular proof of Edward's presumption and confidence in his undertaking against Scotland: but a poet seems to have been a stated officer in the royal retinue when the king went to war <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Leland. Script. Brit. p. 338. Hol∣lingsh. Hist. ii. p. 217. 220. Tanner men∣tions, as a poet of England, one Guliel∣mus Peregrinus, who accompanied Richard the first into the holy land, and sung his at∣chievements there in a Latin poem, entitled ODOEPORICON RICARDI REGIS, lib. i. It is dedicated to Herbert archbishop of Canterbury, and Stephen Turnham, a cap∣tain in the expedition. He flourished about A. D. 1200. Tann. Bibl. p. 591. See Voss. Hist. Lat. p. 441. He is called <Q REND="inline">"poeta per eam aetatem excellens."</Q> See Bal. iii. 45. Pits. 266.</NOTE>. Baston, however, appears to have been chiefly a Latin poet, and therefore does not properly fall into our series.

In the mean time, the bare existence of dramatic compositions in England at this period, even if written in

the Latin tongue, deserve notice in investigating the progress of our poetry. For the same reason I must not pass over a Latin piece, called a comedy, written in this reign, perhaps by Peter Babyon; who by Bale is styled an admirable rheto∣rician and poet, and flourished about the year 1317. This comedy is thus entitled in the Bodleian manuscript, <HI>De Ba∣bione et Croceo domino Babionis et Viola filias<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra Babionis quam Croceus duxit invito Babione, et Pecula uxore Babionis et Fodio suo,</HI> &amp;c <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Arch. B. 52.</NOTE>. It is written in long and short Latin verses, without any appearance of dialogue. In what manner, if ever, this piece was represented theatrically, cannot easily be discovered or ascertained. Unless we suppose it to have been recited by one or more of the characters concerned, at some public entertainment. The story is in Gower's CON∣FESSIO AMANTIS. Whether Gower had it from this per∣formance I will not enquire. It appears at least that he took it from some previous book.</P>

<P>In the mean time it seems most probable, that this piece has been attributed to Peter Babyon, on account of the likeness of the name BABIO, especially as he is a ridiculous character. On the whole, there is nothing dramatic in the structure of this nominal comedy; and it has certainly no claim to that title, only as it contains a familiar and comic story carried
<PB N="234" REF="399"/>
on with much scurrilous satire intended to raise mirth. But it was not uncommon to call any short poem, not serious or tragic, a comedy. In the Bodleian manuscript, which com∣prehends Babyon's poem just mentioned, there follows CO∣MEDIA DE GETA: this is in Latin long and short verses <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Carmina composuit, voluitque placere poeta.</NOTE>, and has no marks of dialogue <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">f. 121.</NOTE>.

He bequeath∣ed estates to that society, part of which were appropriated to buy liveries for some of the senior scholars.

In the British Museum there is an antient Cornish poem on the death and resurrection of Christ. It is on vellum, and has some rude pictures. The beginning and end are lost.

Our drama seems hitherto to have been almost entirely confined to religious subjects, and these plays were nothing more than an ap∣pendage to the specious and mechanical devotion of the times. I do not find expressly, that any play on a profane subject, either tragic or comic, had as yet been exhibited in England. Our very early ancestors scarce knew any other history than that of their religion. Even on such an occa∣sion as the triumphant entry of a king or queen into the city of London, or other places, the pageants were almost entirely scriptural <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">When our Henry the sixth ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red Paris in 1431, in the quality of king of France, he was met at the gate of Saint Denis by a Dumb Shew, representing the birth of the Virgin Mary and her mar∣riage, the adoration of the three kings, and the parable of the sower. This pageant indeed was given by the French: but the readers of Hollingshead will recollect many instances immediately to our purpose. See Monstrelet. apud Fonten. Hist. Theatr. ut supr. p. 37.</NOTE>. Yet I must observe, that an article in one of the pipe-rolls, perhaps of the reign of king John, and con∣sequently about the year 1200, seems to place the rudiments of histrionic exhibition, I mean of general subjects, at a much higher period among us than is commonly imagined.

<P>It is certain, that these MIRACLE-PLAYS were the first of our dramatic exhibitions. But as these pieces frequently re∣quired the introduction of allegorical characters, such as Charity, Sin, Death, Hope, Faith, or the like, and as the common poetry of the times, especially among the French, began to deal much in allegory, at length plays were formed entirely consisting of such personifications. These were called MORALITIES. The miracle-plays, or MYSTERIES, were to∣tally destitute of invention or plan: they tamely represented stories according to the letter of scripture, or the respective legend. But the MORALITIES indicate dawnings of the dra∣matic art: they contain some rudiments of a plot, and even attempt to delineate characters, and to paint manners. From hence the gradual transition to real historical person∣ages was natural and obvious. It may be also observed, that many licentious pleasantries were sometimes introduced in these religious representations. This might imperceptibly lead the way to subjects entirely profane, and to comedy, and perhaps earlier than is imagined. In a<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">MSS. Digb. 134. Bibl.

This tragical business is treated with the most ridi∣culous levity. The good women of Bethlehem attack our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>night-errant with their spinning-wheels, break his head with their distaffs, abuse him as a coward and a disgrace to chivalry, and send him home to Herod as a recreant cham∣pion with much ignominy. It is in an enlightened age only
<PB N="243" REF="408"/>
that subjects of scripture history would be supported with proper dignity. But then an enlightened age would not have chosen such subjects for theatrical exhibition. It is certain that our ancestors intended no sort of impiety by these monstrous and unnatural mixtures. Neither the writers nor the spectators saw the impropriety, nor paid a separate attention to the comic and the srious part of these motley scenes; at least they were persuaded that the solemnity of the subject covered or excused all incongruities. They had no just idea of decorum, consequently but little sense of the ri∣diculous: what appears to us to be the highest burlesque, on them would have made no sort of impression. We must not wonder at this, in an age when courage, devotion, and ignorance, composed the character of European manners; when the knight going to a tournament, first invoked his God, then his mistress, and afterwards proceeded with a safe conscience and great resolution to engage his antagonist.

The reader will perhaps smile at some of these COMBINATIONS. This is the substance and order of the former part of the play. God enters creating the world: he breathes life into Adam, leads him into Paradise, and opens his side while sleeping. Adam and Eve appear naked and <HI>not ashamed,</HI> and the old serpent enters lamenting his fall. He converses with Eve. She eats of the for∣bidden fruit and gives part to Adam.

The serpent <HI>exit</HI> hissing. They are driven from Paradise by four angels and the cherubim with a flaming sword. Adam appears digging the ground, and Eve spinning. Their children Cain and Abel enter: The former kills his brother. Adam's lamentation. Cain is banished, &amp;c.</NOTE>, Adam and Eve are both exhibited on the stage naked, and conversing about
<PB N="244" REF="409"/>
their nakedness: this very pertinently introduces the next scene, in which they have coverings of fig-leaves. This extraor∣dinary spectacle was beheld by a numerous assembly of both sexes with great composure: they had the authority of scrip∣ture for such a representation, and they gave matters just as they found them in the third chapter of Genesis. It would have been absolute heresy to have departed from the sacred text in personating the primitive appearance of our first parents, whom the spectators so nearly resembled in sim∣plicity: and if this had not been the case, the dramatists were ignorant what to reject and what to retain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, profane dramas seem to have been known in France at a much earlier period <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">John of Salisbury, a writer of the ele∣venth century, speaking of the common di∣versions of his time, says, <Q REND="inline">"Nostra aetas prolapsa ad fabulas et quaevis inania, non modo aures et cor prostituit vanitati, &amp;c."</Q> <BIBL>POLICRAT. i. 8.</BIBL> An ingenious French writer, Mons.

But perhaps <HI>fabula</HI> has too vague and general a sense, especially in its present combination with <HI>quaevis inania,</HI> to bear so precise and critical an interpreta∣tion. I will add, that if this reasoning be true, the words will be equally applicable to the English stage.—At Constantinople it seems that the stage flourished much under Justinian and Theodora, about the year 540.

This indeed was a subject of a religious tendency; but not long afterwards, in the year 1395, perhaps before, the interesting story of PATIENT GRISILDE appears to have been acted at Paris.

<P>In France the religious MYSTERIES, often called PITEAUX, or PITOUX, were certainly very fashionable, and of high antiquity: yet from any written evidence, I do not find them more antient than those of the English.

But the French MYSTERIES were chiefly performed by the religious communities, and some of their FETES almost entirely con∣sisted of a dramatic or personated shew. At the FLAST of ASSES, instituted in honour of Baalam's Ass, the clergy walked on Christmas day in procession, habited to represent the prophets and others. Moses appeared in an alb and cope, with a long beard and rod. David had a green vestment. Baalam with an immense pair of spurs, rode on a wooden ass, which inclosed a speaker. There were also six Jews and six Gentiles. Among other characters the poet Virgil was introduced as a gentile prophet and a translator of the Sibylline oracles. They thus moved in procession, chanting versi∣cles, and conversing in character on the nativity and king∣dom of Christ, through the body of the church, till they came into the choir. Virgil speaks some Latin hexameters, during the ceremony, not out of his fourth eclogue, but wretched monkish lines in rhyme.

to deduce the practice of our plays being acted by the choir-boys of St. Paul's church, and the chapel royal, which continued, as I before observed, till Cromwell's usurpa∣tion. The English and French stages mutually throw light on each other's history. But perhaps it will be thought, that in some of these instances I have exemplified in nothing more than farcical and gesticulatory representations. Yet even these traces should be attended to. In the mean time we may observe upon the whole, that the modern drama had its foundation in our religion, and that it was raised and supported by the clergy. The truth is, the members of the ecclesiastical societies were almost the only persons who could read, and their numbers easily furnished per∣formers: they abounded in leisure, and their very relaxa∣tions were religious.</P>
<P>I did not mean to touch upon the Italian stage. But as so able a judge as Riccoboni seems to allow, that Italy derived her theatre from those of France and England, by way of an additional illustration of the antiquity of the two last, I will here produce one or two MIRACLE-PLAYS, acted much earlier in Italy than any piece mentioned by that in∣genious writer, or by Crescimbeni. In the year 1298, on <Q REND="inline">"the feast of Pentecost, and the two following holidays, the representation of the PLAY OF CHRIST, that is of his passion, resurrection, ascension, judgment, and the mis∣sion of the holy ghost, was performed by the clergy of

<P>In this transient view of the origin and progress of our drama, which was incidentally suggested by the mention of Baston's supposed Comedies, I have trespassed upon future periods. But I have chiefly done this for the sake of con∣nection, and to prepare the mind of the reader for other anecdotes of the history of our stage, which will occur in the course of our researches, and are reserved for their res∣pective places.

At his triumphant re∣turn from Scotland, he was met by two hundred and thirty knights at Dunstable, who received their victorious monarch with a grand exhibition of these martial exercises.

Nothing could be more natural to such a romantic monarch, in such an age, than the renovation of this most antient and revered institution of chivalry. It was a prelude to the renowned order of the garter, which he soon after∣wards founded at Windsor, during the ceremonies of a magnificent feast, which had been proclaimed by his heralds in Germany, France, Scotland, Burgundy, Heynault, and Brabant, and lasted fifteen days <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Barnes, i. ch. 22. p. 292.

At an earlier period, the growing gallantry of the times appears in a public instrument. It is in the reign of Ed∣ward the first. Twelve jurymen depose upon oath the state of the king's lordship at Woodstock: and among other things it is solemnly recited, that Henry the second often resided at Woodstock, <Q REND="inline">"pro amore cujusdam mulieris nomine Rosamunda."</Q> <BIBL>Hearne's Avesbury, Append. p. 331.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even Philippa, a queen of singular elegance of manners <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">And of distinguished beauty. Hearne says, that the statuaries of those days used to make queen Philippa a model for their images of the Virgin Mary. Gloss. Rob. Brun. p. 349. He adds, that the holy virgin, in a representation of her as∣sumption was constantly figured young and beautiful; and that the artists before the Reformation generally <Q REND="inline">"had the most beautiful women of the greatest quality in their view, when they made statues and figures of her."</Q> <BIBL>ibid. p. 550.</BIBL></NOTE>, partook so much of the heroic spirit which was univer∣sally diffused, that just before an engagement with the king of Scotland, she rode round the ranks of the English army encouraging the soldiers, and was with some diffi∣culty persuaded or compelled to relinquish the field <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Froissart. i. c. 138.</NOTE>. The countess of Montfort is another eminent instance of female heroism in this age. When the strong town of Hennebond, near Rennes, was besieged by the French, this redoubted

amazon rode in complete armour from street to street, on a large courser, animating the garison <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Froissart says, that when the English proved victorious, the countess came out of the castle, and in the street kissed Sir Walter Manny the English general, and his cap∣tains, one after another, twice or thrice, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omme noble et valliant dame.</HI> On another like occasion, the same historian relates, that she went out to meet the officers, whom she kissed and sumptuously entertained in her castle. i. c. 86. At many magnificent tournaments in France, the ladies determined the prize. See Mem. anc. Cheval. i. p. 175. seq. p. 223. seq. An English squire, on the side of the French, captain of the castle of Beaufort, called himself <HI>le Poursuivant d'amour,</HI> in 1369. Froissart, l. i. c. 64. In the midst of grand engagements between the French and English armies, when per∣haps the interests of both nations are vitally concerned, Froissart gives many instance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of officers entering into separate and per∣sonal combat to dispute the beauty of their respective mistresses. Hist. l. ii. ch. 33. 43. On this occasion an ingenious French writer observes, that Homer's heroes of antient Greece are just as extravagant, who in the heat of the sight, often stop on a sudden, to give an account of the genealogy of them∣selves or of their horses. Mem. anc. Che∣val. ubi supr. Sir Walter Manny, in 1343, in attacking the castle of Guigard ex∣claims, <Q REND="inline">"let me never be beloved of my mistress, if I refuse this attack, &amp;c."</Q> <BIBL>Froissart, i. 81.</BIBL></NOTE>. Finding from a high tower that the whole French army was engaged in the as∣sault, she issued, thus completely accoutred, through a con∣venient postern at the head of three hundred chosen soldiers, and set fire to the French camp <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froissart, i. c. 80. Du Chesne, p. 656. Mezeray, ii. 3. p. 19. seq.</NOTE>. In the mean time riches and plenty, the effects of conquest, peace, and prosperity, were spread on every side; and new luxuries were imported in great abundance from the conquered countries. There were few families, even of a moderate condition, but had in their possession precious articles of dress or furniture; such as silks, fur, tapestry, embroidered beds, cups of gold, silver, porcelain, and crystal, bracelets, chains, and necklaces, brought from Caen, Calais, and other opulent foreign cities <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Walsing. Ypodigm. 121. Hist. 159.</NOTE>. The encrease of rich furniture appears in a foregoing reign. In an act of Parliament of Edward the first <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">A. D. 1300. Edw. i. an. 28. cap. xx.</NOTE>, are many regulations, directed to goldsmiths, not only in London, but in other towns, concerning the sterling allay of vessels and jewels of gold and silver, &amp;c. And it is said, <Q REND="inline">"Gra∣vers or cutters of stones and seals shall give every one their just weight of silver and gold."</Q> It should be
<PB N="255" REF="420"/>
remembered, that about this period Europe had opened a new commercial intercourse with the ports of India <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Anderson, Hist. Comm. i. p. 141.</NOTE>. No less than eight sumptuary laws, which had the usual effect of not being observed, were enacted in one session of parliament during this reign <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ann. 37. Edw. iii. cap. viii. seq.</NOTE>. Amid these growing elegancies and superfluities, foreign manners, especially of the French, were perpetually encreasing; and the native simplicity of the English people was perceptibly corrupted and effaced. It is not quite uncertain that masques had their beginning in this reign <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 338.</NOTE>. These shews, in which the greatest personages of the court often bore a part, and which arrived at their height in the reign of Henry the eighth, encou∣raged the arts of address and decorum, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms of the rise of polished manners <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">This spirit of splendor and gallantry was continued in the reign of his successor.

<P>In a reign like this, we shall not be surprised to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d such a poet as Chaucer: with whom a new era in English poetry begins, and on whose account many of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se circumstances are mentioned, as they serve to prepare the reader for his character, on which they throw no inconsider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble light.</P>
<P>But before we enter on so ample a field, it will be per∣haps less embarrassing, at least more consistent with our prescribed method, if we previously display the merits of two or three poets, who appeared in the former part of the reign of Edward the third, with other incidental matters.</P>
<P>The first of these is Richard Hampole, an eremite of the order of saint Augustine. He was a doctor of divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, and lived a solitary life near the nuns of Hampole, four miles from Doncaster in Yorkshire. The neighbourhood of this female society could not withdraw our recluse from his devotions
<PB N="256" REF="421"/>
and his studies. He flourished in the year 1349 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wharton, App. ad Cave, p. 75. Saecul. Wickley.</NOTE>. His Latin theological tracts, both in prose and ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, are numerous; in which Leland justly thinks he has di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>played more erudition than eloquence. His principal pieces of English rhyme are a Paraphrase of part of the book of Job, of the lord's prayer, of the seven penitential psalms, and the PRICKE OF CONSCIENCE. But our hermit's poetry, which indeed from these titles promises but little entertainment, has no tincture of sentiment, imagination, or elegance. The fol∣lowing verses are extracted from the PRICKE OF CONSCIENCE, one of the most common manuscripts in our libraries, and I prophesy that I am its last transcriber. But I must ob∣serve first, that this piece is divided into seven parts. I. Of man's nature. II. Of the world. III. Of death. IV. Of purgatory. V. Of the day of judgment. VI. Of the tor∣ments of hell.

Most of his many theological pieces seem to have been translated into English soon after they appeared: and those pieces abound among our manuscripts.

The author and translator were easily confounded. As to the copy of the English poem given to bishop Grosthead, he could not be the translator, to say nothing more, if Hampole wrote the Latin original. On the whole, whoever was the author of the two translations, at least we may pronounce with some certainty, that they belong to the reign of Ed∣ward the third.</P>

<P>THE next poet in succession is one who deserves more attention on various accounts. This is Robert Long∣lande, author of the poem called the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN, a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cular priest, and a fellow of Oriel college, in Oxford. He flourished about the year 1350 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I have here followed a date commonly received. But it may be observed, that there is in this poem an allusion to the fall of Edward the second. The si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of Calais is also mentioned as a recent fact; and <HI>Bribery</HI> accuses <HI>Conscience</HI> of obstructing the conquest of France. See more in Observa∣tions on the Fairy Queen, ii. §. xi. p. 281.</NOTE>. This poem contains a series of distinct visions, which the author imagines himself to have seen, while he was sleeping, after a long ramble on Malverne-hills in Worcestershire. It is a satire on the vices of almost every profession: but particu∣larly on the corruptions of the clergy, and the absurdities of superstition. These are ridiculed with much humour and spirit, couched under a strong vein of allegorical invention. But instead of availing himself of the rising and rapid im∣provements of the English language, Longland prefers and adopts the style of the Anglo-Saxon poets. Nor did he make these writers the models of his language only: he likewise imitates their alliterative versification, which con∣sisted in using an aggregate of words beginning with the same letter. He has therefore rejected rhyme, in the place of which he thinks it sufficient to substitute a perpetual al∣literation. But this imposed constraint of seeking identical initials, and the affectation of obsolete English, by demand∣ing a constant and necessary departure from the natural and obvious forms of expression, while it circumscribed the powers of our author's genius, contributed also to render his
<PB N="267" REF="432"/>
manner extremely perplexed, and to disgust the reader with obscurities. The satire is conducted by the agency of several allegorical personages, such as Avarice, Bribery, Simony, Theology, Conscience, &amp;c. There is much imagination in the following picture, which is intended to represent human life, and its various occupations.</P>

<L>To Wy and to Winchester <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Antiently, before many flourishing towns were established, and the necessaries or ornaments of life, from the convenience of communication and the encrease of provincial civility, could be procured in various places, goods and commodities of every kind, were chiefly sold at fairs; to which, as to one universal mart, the people resorted periodically, and supplied most of their wants for the ensuing year. The dis∣play of merchandise, and the conflux of customers, at these principal and almost only emporia of domestic commerce, was pro∣digious: and they were therefore often held on open and extensive plains. One of the chief of them seems to have been that of St. Giles's hill or down near Win∣chester, to which our poet here refers. It was instituted and given as a kind of re∣venue to the bishop of Winchester, by William the conqueror; who by his charter permitted it to continue for three days. But in consequence of new royal grants, Henry the third prolonged its continuance to sixteen days. Its jurisdiction extended seven miles round, and comprehended even Southampton, then a capital trading town: and all merchants who sold wares within that circuit, forfeited them to the bishop. Officers were placed at a consider∣able distance, at bridges and other avenues of access to the fair, to exact toll of all merchandise passing that way. In the mean time, all shops in the city of Winchester were shut. In the fair was a court called the pavilion, at which the bishop's justi∣ciaries and other officers assisted, with power to try causes of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious sorts for seven miles round: nor among other singular claims could any lord of a manor hold a court-baron within the said circuit, without licence from the pavilion. During this time, the bishop was empowered to take toll of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very load or parcel of goods passing through the gates of the city. On Saint Giles's eve, the mayor, bailiffs, and citizens of the city of Winchester, delivered the keys of the
four city gates to the bishop's officers; who, during the said sixteen days, appointed a mayor and bailiff of their own to govern the city, and also a coroner to act within the said city. Tenants of the bishop, who held lands by doing service at the pavilion, attended the same with horses and armour, not only to do suit at the court there, but to be ready to assist the bishop's officers in the execution of writs and other services. But I cannot here enumerate the many ex∣traordinary privileges granted to the bishop on this occasion; all tending to obstruct trade, and to oppress the people. Nume∣rous foreign merchants frequented this fair: and it appears, that the justiciaries of the pavilion, and the treasurer of the bishop's palace of Wolvesey, received annually for a fee, according to antient custom, four basons and ewers, of those foreign mer∣chants who sold brasen vessels in the fair, and were called <HI>mercat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res diaunteres.</HI> In the fair several streets were formed, assigned to the sale of different commodities; and called the <HI>Drap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry,</HI> the <HI>Pottery,</HI> the <HI>Spicery,</HI> &amp;c. Many monasteries, in and about Win∣chester, had shops, or houses, in these streets, used only at the fair, which they held under the bishop, and often lett by lease for a term of years. One place in the fair was called <HI>Speciarium San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wythini,</HI> or <HI>the Spicery of Saint Swithin's monastery.</HI> In the revenue-rolls of the antient bishops of Winchester, this fair makes a grand and separate article of reception, under this title.

The whole re∣ception to the bishop this year from the fair, amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed only to 45 <HI>l.</HI> 18 <HI>s.</HI> 5<HI>d.</HI> Yet this sum, small as it may seem, was worth up∣wards of 400 <HI>l.</HI> Edward the first sent a pre∣cept to the sheriff of Hampshire, to restore to the bishop this fair; which his escheator Malcolm de Harlegh had seized into the king's hands, without command of the trea∣surer and barons of the exchequer, in the year 1292. Registr. Joh. de Pontissara, Episc. Wint. fol. 195. After the charter of Henry the third, many kings by char∣ter confirmed this fair, with all its privi∣leges, to the bishops of Winchester. The last charter was of Henry the eighth to bishop Richard Fox and his successors, in the year 1511. But it was followed by the usual confirmation-charter of Charles the second. In the year 1144, when Brian Fitz-count, lord of Wallingford in Berk∣shire, maintained Walling<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord castle, one of the strongest garrisons belonging to Maud the empress, and consequently sent out numerous parties for contributions and provisions, Henry de Blois bishop of Win∣chester enjoined him not to molest any pas∣sengers that were coming to his fair at Win∣chester, under pain of excommunication. <HI>Omnibus ad</HI> FERIAM MEAM <HI>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>entibus,</HI> &amp;c. MSS. Dodsworth. vol. 89. f. 76. Bibl. Bodl. This was in king Stephen's reign. In that of Richard the first, in the year 1194, the king grants to Portsmouth a fair lasting for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fteen days, with all the pri∣vileges of Saint Giles's fair at Winchester. Anders. Hist. Com. i. 197. In the year 1234, the eighteenth of Henry the second, the fermier of the city of Winchester paid twenty pounds to Ailward chamberlain of Winchester castle, to buy a robe at this fair for the king's son, and divers silver imple∣ments for a chapel in the castle. Madox, Exch. p. 251. It appears from a curious record now remaining, containing <HI>The Es∣tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishment and Expences of the houshold</HI> of Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland, in the year 1512, and printed by doctor Percy, that the stores of his lordship's house at Wresille, for the whole year, were laid in from fairs. <Q REND="inline">"He that standes charged with my lordes house for the houll yeir, if he may possible, <HI>shall be at all</HI> FAIRES where the groice emptions shall be boughte for the house for the houlle yeire, as wine, wax, beiffes, multons, wheite, and maltie."</Q> p. 407. This last quota∣tion is a proof, that fairs still continued to be the principal marts for purchasing necessaries
in large quantities, which now are supplied by frequent trading towns: and the mention of <HI>beiffes</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ultons,</HI> which were salted oxen and sheep, shews that at so late a period they knew but little of breeding cattle. Their ignorance of so im∣portant an article of husbandry, is also an evi∣dence, that in the reign of Henry the eighth the state of population was much lower among us than we may imagine.</P>
<P>In the statutes of Saint Mary Ot∣tery's college in Devonshire, given by bishop Grandison the founder, the stew∣ards and sacrist are ordered to purch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se annually two hundred pounds of wax for the choir of the college, at this fair. <Q REND="inline">"Cap. lxvii.—Pro luminaribus vero omnibus supradictis inveniendis, etiam statuimus, quod senescalli scaccarii per visum et auxi∣lium sacriste, omni anno, in NUNDINIS WYNTON, vel alibi apud Toryngton et in partibus Barnstepol, ceram sufficien∣tem, quam ad ducentas libras aestimamus pro uno anno ad minus, faciant pro∣videri."</Q> These statutes were granted in the year 1338.

In the accompts of the Priories of Maxtoke in Warwickshire, and of Bicester in Ox∣fordshire, under the reign of Henry the sixth, the monks appear to have laid in yearly stores of various yet common neces∣saries, at the fair of Sturbridge in Cam∣bridgeshire, at least one hundred miles distant from either monastery. It may seem surprising, that their own neighbourhood, including the cities of Oxford and Coven∣try, could not supply them with commodi∣ties neither rare nor costly, which they thus fetched at a considerable expence of carriage.

This, I suppose, was a favourite doctrine in Wickliffe's discourses. I cannot help tak∣ing notice of a passage in Piers Plowman, which shews how the reigning passion for chivalry infected the ideas and expressions of the writers of this period. The poet is describing the crucifixion, and speaking of the person who pierced our Saviour's side with a spear. This person our author calls <HI>a knight,</HI> and says that he came forth, <Q REND="inline">"with his spere in hand, and j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted with Jesus."</Q> Afterwards for doing so base an act as that of wounding a dead body, he is pronounced a disgrace to <HI>knighthood:</HI> and our <Q REND="inline">"Cham∣pion chevaler c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se knyght"</Q> is ordered to <HI>yield</HI> himself <HI>recreant.</HI> fol. lxxxviii. b. This knight's name is Longis, and he is blind: but receives his sight from the blood which springs from our Saviour's side. This miracle is recorded in the GOLDEN LEGENDE.

<P>It is not improbable, that Longland here had his eye on the old French ROMAN D' ANTECHRIST, a poem written by Huon de Meri, about the year 1228. The author of this piece supposes that Antichrist is on earth, that he visits every profession and order of life, and finds numerous par∣tisans. The VICES arrange themselves under the banner of ANTECHRIST, and the VIRTUES under that of CHRIST.
<PB N="286" REF="451"/>
These two armies at length come to an engagement, and the battle ends to the honour of the Virtues, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> total defeat of the Vices. The BANNER OF ANTICHRIST has before occurred in our quotations from Longland. The title of Huon de Meri's poem deserves notice. It is TUR∣NOYEMENT DE L' ANTECHRIST.

<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<P>TO the VISION OF PIERCE PLOWMAN has been commonly annexed a poem called PIERCE THE PLOWMAN'S CREDE, and which may properly be considered as its appendage <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The first edition is by R. Wolfe, Lon∣don, 1553. 4<SUP>to</SUP>. In four sheets. It was re∣printed, and added to Rogers's, or the fourth edition of the <HI>Vision,</HI> 1561. It was evidently written after the year 1384. Wickliffe died in that year, and he is men∣tioned as no longer living in Signat. C. ii. edit. 1561. Walter Britte or Brit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, a fol∣lower of Wickliffe, is also mentioned, Signat. C. iii. Britte is placed by Bale in 1390. Cent. vi. 94. See also Fuller's Worth. p. 8. <HI>Wales.</HI> The reader will par∣don this small anticipation for the sake of connection.</NOTE>. It is professedly written in imitation of our VISION, but by a different hand. The author, in the character of a plain uninformed person, pretends to be ignorant of his creed; to be instructed in the articles of which, he applies by turns to the four orders of mendicant friers. This circumstance affords an obvious occasion of exposing in lively colours the tricks of those societies. After so unexpected a disappoint∣ment, he meets one Pierce, or Peter, a plowman, who re∣solves his doubts, and teaches him the principles of true religion. In a copy of the CREDE lately presented to me by the bishop of Gloucester, and once belonging to Mr. Pope, the latter in his own hand has inserted the following abstract of its plan. <Q REND="inline">"An ignorant plain man having learned his Pater-noster and Ave-mary, wants to learn his creed. He asks several religious men of the several orders to teach it him. First of a friar Minor, who bids him beware of the Carmelites, and assures him they can teach him no∣thing, describing their faults, &amp;c. But that the friars Minors shall save him, whether he learns his creed or not.
<PB N="288" REF="453"/>
He goes next to the friars Preachers, whose magnificent monastery he describes: there he meets a fat friar, who declaims against the Augustines. He is shocked at his pride, and goes to the Augustines. They rail at the Mi∣norites. He goes to the Carmes; they abuse the Domini∣cans, but promise him salvation, without the creed, for money. He leaves them with indignation, and finds an honest poor PLOWMAN in the field, and tells him how he was disappointed by the four orders. The plowman an∣swers with a long invective against them."</Q></P>
<P>The language of the CREDE is less embarrassed and ob∣scure than that of the VISION. But before I proceed to a specimen, it may not be perhaps improper to prepare the reader, by giving an outline of the constitution and cha∣racter of the four orders of mendicant friars, the object of our poet's satire: an enquiry in many respects connected with the general purport of this history, and which, in this place at least, cannot be deemed a digression, as it will il∣lustrate the main subject, and explain many particular pas∣sages, of the PLOWMAN'S CREDE <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">And of some perhaps quoted above from the VISION.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Long before the thirteenth century, the monastic orders, as we have partly seen in the preceding poem, in consequence of their ample revenues, had degenerated from their primi∣tive austerity, and were totally given up to luxury and indo∣lence. Hence they became both unwilling and unable to execute the purposes of their establishment: to instruct the people, to check the growth of heresies, or to promote in any respect the true interests of the church. They forsook all their religious obligations, despised the authority of their superiors, and were abandoned without shame or remorse to every species of dissipation and licentiousness. About the beginning therefore of the thirteenth century, the condition and circumstances of the church rendered it absolutely necessary
<PB N="289" REF="454"/>
to remedy these evils, by introducing a new order of religious, who being destitute of fixed possessions, by the severity of their manners, a professed contempt of riches, and an unwearied perseverance in the duties of preaching and prayer, might restore respect to the monastic institution, and recover the honours of the church. These were the four orders of mendicant or begging friars, commonly deno∣minated the Franciscans, the Dominicans, the Carmelites, and the Augustines <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The Franciscans were often styled friars-minors, or minorites, and grey∣friars: the Dominicans, friars-preachers, and sometimes black-friars: The Carme∣lites white-friars; and the Austins grey∣friars. The first establishment of the Do∣minicans in England was at Oxford in 1221. Of the Franciscans at Canterbury. These two were the most eminent of the four orders. The Dominican friary at Ox∣ford stood in an island on the south of the city, south-west of the Franciscan friary, the site of which is hereafter described.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These societies soon surpassed all the rest, not only in the purity of their lives, but in the number of their privileges, and the multitude of their members. Not to mention the success which attends all novelties, their reputation arose quickly to an amazing height. The popes, among other uncommon immunities, allowed them the liberty of travel∣ling wherever they pleased, of conversing with persons of all ranks, of instructing the youth and the people in general, and of hearing confessions, without reserve or restriction: and as on these occasions, which gave them opportunities of appearing in public and conspicuous situations, they ex∣hibited more striking marks of gravity and sanctity than were observable in the deportment and conduct of the mem∣bers of other monasteries, they were regarded with the highest esteem and veneration throughout all the countries of Europe.</P>
<P>In the mean time they gained still greater respect, by cul∣tivating the literature then in vogue, with the greatest assi∣duity and success. Gianoni says, that most of the theological
<PB N="290" REF="455"/>
professors in the university of Naples, newly founded in the year 1220, were chosen from the mendicants <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hist. Nap. xvi. 3.</NOTE>. They were the principal teachers of theology at Paris, the school where this science had received its origin <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Boul. Hist. Academ. Paris. iii. p. 138. 240. 244. 248, &amp;c.</NOTE>. At Oxford and Cambridge respectively, all the four orders had flourishing monasteries. The most learned scholars in the university of Oxford, at the close of the thirteenth century, were Franciscan friars: and long after this period, the Franciscans appear to have been the sole support and ornament of that university <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><P>This circumstance in some degree rous∣ed the monks from their indolence, and induced the greater monasteries to procure the foundation of small colleges in the uni∣versities for the education of their novices. At Oxford the monks had also schools which bore the name of their respective orders: and there were schools in that uni∣versity which were appropriated to particu∣lar monasteries. Kennet's Paroch. Ant. p. 214. Wood, Hist. Ant. Univ. Oxon. i. 119. Leland says, that even in his time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Stamford, a temporary university, the names of halls inhabited by the novices of Peterborough, Sempringham, and Vaul∣drey abbies, were remaining. Itin. vi. p. 21. And it appears, that the greater part of the proceeders in theology at Oxford and Cambridge, just before the reformation, were monks. But we do not find, that in consequence of all these efforts, the monks made a much greater figure in literature.</P>
<P>In this rivalry which subsisted between the mendicants and the monks, the latter sometimes availed themselves of their riches: and with a view to attract popula∣rity, and to eclipse the growing lustre of the former, proceeded to their degrees in the universities with prodigious parade. In the year 1298, William de Brooke, a Be∣nedictine of Saint Peter's abbey at Glou∣cester, took the degree of doctor in divi∣nity at Oxford. He was attended on this important occasion by the abbot and whole convent of Gloucester, the abbots of West∣minster, Reading, Abingdon, Evesham, and Malmesbury, with one hundred noble∣men and esquires, on horses richly capari∣soned. These were entertained at a sump∣tuous feast in the refectory of Gloucester college. But it should be observed, that he was the first of the Benedictine order that attained this dignity. Wood, Hist. Ant. Univ. Oxon. i. 25. col. 1. See also Stevens, Mon. 1. 70.</P></NOTE>. Hence it was that bishop Hugh de Balsham, founder of Peter-house at Cambridge, orders in his statutes given about the year 1280, that some of his scholars should annually repair to Oxford for improvement in the sciences <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><Q>"De scholaribus emittendis ad univer∣sitatem Oxonie pro doctrina."</Q> Cap. xviii.</NOTE>. That is, to study under the Franciscan readers. Such was the eminence of the Franciscan friary at Oxford, that the learned bishop Grosthead, in the year 1253, bequeathed all

In the eleventh century, Aristotle's philosophy had been condemned in the university of Paris as heretical. About a hundred years afterwards, these prejudices began to subside; and new translations of Aristotle's writings were published in Latin by our countryman Michael Scotus, and others, with more attention to the original Greek, at least without the pompous and perplexed circumlocutions which appeared in the Arabic versions hitherto used. In the mean time the mendicant orders sprung up: who hap∣pily availing themselves of these new translations, and making them the constant subject of their scholastic lectures, were the first who revived the doctrines of this philosopher, and acquired the merit of having opened a new system of science <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See Joann.

In the year 1336, says he, on the feast of Epiph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny, the first feast of the three kings was celebrated at Milan, by the convent of the friars preachers. The three kings appeared crowned on three great horses, r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chly habited, surrounded by pages, body-guards, and an innumerable retinue.

<P>The buildings of the mendicant monasteries, especially in England, were remarkably magnificent, and commonly much exceeded those of the endowed convents of the second mag∣nitude. As these fraternities were professedly poor, and could not from their original institution receive estates, the munificence of their benefactors was employed in adorning their houses with stately refectories and churches: and for these and other purposes they did nor want address to pro∣cure multitudes of patrons, which was facilitated by the notion of their superior sanctity. It was fashionable for persons of the highest rank to bequeath their bodies to be buried in the friary churches, which were consequently filled with sumptuous shrines and superb monuments <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Their churches were esteemed more sacred than others.</NOTE>. In the
<PB N="294" REF="459"/>

It is probable that they derived more benefit from casual charity, than they would have gained from a regular endowment. The Franciscans indeed enjoyed from the popes the privilege of distributing indulgences, a valuable indemnification for their voluntary poverty <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Baluz. Miscellan. tom. iv. 490. vii. 392.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the whole, two of these mendicant institutions, the Dominicans and the Franciscans, for the space of near three centuries, appear to have governed the European church and state with an absolute and universal sway: they filled, during that period, the most eminent ecclesiastical and civil stations, taught in the universities with an authority which silenced all opposition, and maintained the disputed prerogative of the Roman pontiff against the united influence of prelates and kings, with a vigour only to be paralleled by its success. The Dominicans and Franciscans were, before the Reforma∣tion, exactly what the Jesuits have been since. They disre∣garded their monastic character and profession, and were employed, not only in spiritual matters, but in temporal affairs of the greatest consequence; in composing the dif∣ferences of princes, concluding treaties of peace, and con∣certing alliances: they presided in cabinet councils, levied national subsidies, influenced courts, and managed the ma∣chines of every important operation and event, both in the religious and political world.</P>
<P>From what has been here said it is natural to suppose, that the mendicants at length became universally odious. The high esteem in which they were held, and the transcendent degree of authority which they had assumed, only served to
<PB N="295" REF="460"/>
render them obnoxious to the clergy of every rank, to the monasteries of other orders, and to the universities. It was not from ignorance, but from a knowledge of mankind, that they were active in propagating superstitious notions, which they knew were calculated to captivate the multitude, and to strengthen the papal interest; yet at the same time, from the vanity of displaying an uncommon sagacity of thought, and a superior skill in theology, they affected no∣velties in doctrine, which introduced dangerous errors, and tended to shake the pillars of orthodoxy. Their ambition was unbounded, and their arrogance intolerable. Their en∣creasing numbers became, in many states, an enormous and unweildy burthen to the commonwealth. They had abused the powers and privileges which had been entrusted to them; and the common sense of mankind could not long be blinded or deluded by the palpable frauds and artifices, which these rapacious zealots so notoriously practised for en∣riching their convents. In England, the university of Ox∣ford resolutely resisted the perpetual encroachments of the Dominicans <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Wood, ut supr. i. 150. 154. 196.</NOTE>; and many of our theologists attacked all the four orders with great vehemence and severity. Exclusive of the jealousies and animosities which naturally subsisted be∣tween four rival institutions, their visionary refinements, and love of disputation, introduced among them the most violent dissensions. The Dominicans aimed at popularity, by an obstinate denial of the immaculate conception. Their pretended sanctity became at length a term of reproach, and their learning fell into discredit. As polite letters and ge∣neral knowledge encreased, their speculative and pedantic divinity gave way to a more liberal turn of thinking, and a more perspicuous mode of writing. Bale, who was himself a Carmelite friar, says, that his order, which was eminently distinguished for scholastic erudition, began to lose their estimation about the year 1460. Some of them were imprudent
<PB N="296" REF="461"/>
enough to engage openly in political controversy; and the Augustines destroyed all their repute and authority in England by seditious sermons, in which they laboured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o supplant the progeny of Edward the fourth, and to establish the title of the usurper Richard <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Newcourt, Repert. i. 289.</NOTE>. About the year 1530, Leland visited the Franciscan friary at Oxford, big with the hopes of finding, in their celebrated library, if not many valuable books, at least those which had been bequeathed by the learned bishop Grosthead. The delays and difficulties with which he procured admittance into this venerable re∣pository, heightened his curiosity and expectations. At length, after much ceremony, being permitted to enter, instead of an inestimable treasure, he saw little more than empty shelves covered with cobwebs and dust <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Leland describes this adventure with some humour. <Q REND="inline">"Contigit ut copiam pete∣rem videndi bibliothecam Franciscano∣rum, ad quod obstreperunt asini aliquot, rudentes nulli prorsus mortalium tam sanctos aditus et recessus adire, nisi Gar∣diano <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et sacris sui collegii baccalariis.

Gervasius Dorobernensis, in his account of the burning of Canterbury Cathedral in the year 1174, says, that not only the beam-work was destroyed, but the cieling underneath it, or concameration called coelum, being of wood beautifully painted, was also consumed. <Q REND="inline">"Coelum inferius <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gre∣gie depictum,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> <BIBL>p. 1289. Dec. Script. Lond. 1652.</BIBL> And Stubbes, <HI>Actus Pontif. Eborac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsium,</HI> says, that arch bishop Aldred, about 1060, built the whole church of York from the Presbytery to the Tower, and <Q REND="inline">"superius <HI>opere pictorio</HI> quod Coelum vocant <HI>auro multi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormiter intermixto,</HI> mirabili arte construxit."</Q> <BIBL>p. 1704. Dec. Script. ut supr.</BIBL> There are many instances in the pipe-rolls, not yet printed. The roof of the church of Cassino in Italy is or∣dered to be painted in 1349, like that of St. John Lateran at Rome. Hist. Cassin. tom. ii. p. 545. col. 1. Dugdale has printed an antient French record, by which it appears that there was a hall in the cas∣tle of Dover called <HI>Arthur's hall,</HI> and a chamber called <HI>Geneura's chamber.</HI> Monast. ii. 2. I suppose, because the walls of these apartments were respectively adorned with paintings of each. Geneura is Arthur's queen. In the pipe-rolls of Henry the third we have this notice, A. D. 1259. <Q REND="inline">"Infra portam castri et birbecanam, etc. ab exitu CAMERAE ROSAMUNDAE usque capel∣lam sancti Thomae in Castro Wynton."</Q> Rot. Pip. Henr. iii. an. 43. This I once supposed to be a chamber in Winchester castle, so called because it was painted with the figure or some history of fair Rosamond. But a ROSAMUND-CHAMBER was a com∣mon apartment in the royal castles, per∣haps in imitation of her BOWER at Wood∣stock, literally nothing more than a <HI>cham∣ber,</HI> which yet was curiously constructed and decorated, at least in memory of it. The old prose paraphrast of the Chronicle of Robert of Glocester says, <Q REND="inline">"BOURES hadde the Rosamonde a bout in Enge∣londe, which this kynge [Hen. ii.] for hir sake made: atte Waltham bishope's, in the castelle of Wynchester, atte park of Fremantel, atte Marteleston, atte Woodestoke, and other fele [many] places."</Q> Chron. edit. Hearne, 479. This passage indeed seems to imply, that Henry the second himself provided for his fair concubine a BOWER, or chamber of peculiar construction, not only at Wood∣stock, but in all the royal palaces; which, as may be concluded from the pipe-roll just cited, was called by her name. Leland says, that in the stately castle of Pickering in Yorkshire, <Q REND="inline">"in the first court be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oure Toures, of the which one is caullid <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣samundes Toure.</HI>"</Q> Itin. fol. 71.

<P>I must not quit our Ploughman without observing, that some other satirical pieces anterior to the Reformation, bear the adopted name of PIERS THE PLOWMAN. Under the character of a plowman the religious are likewise lashed, in a poem written in apparent imitation of Longland's VISION, and attributed to Chaucer. I mean the PLOWMAN'S TALE <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Perhaps falsely. Unless Chaucer wrote the <HI>Crede,</HI> which I cannot believe. For in Chaucer's PLOWMAN'S TALE this Crede is alluded to. v. 3005.

This was a recent and notorious instance. But in this appointment the king probably paid a compliment to that prelate's singular talents for business, his activity, circumspection, and management, rather than to any scientific and professed skill in architecture which he might have possessed. It seems to me that he was only a supervisor or comptroller on this occasion. It was common to depute churchmen to this department, from an idea of their superior prudence and probity. Thus John, the prior of St. Swithin's at Winchester in 1280, is commissioned by brief from the king, to supervise large repairs done by the sheriff in the castle of Winchester, and the royal manor of Wol∣mer. MS. Registr. Priorat. Quat. 19. fol. 3. The bishop of S. David's was master of the works at building King's College. Hearne's Elmh. p. 353. Alcock, bishop of Ely, was comptroller of the royal buildings under Henry the seventh. Parker Hist. Cambr. p. 119. He, like Wykeham, was a great builder, but not therefore an architect. Ri∣chard Williams, dean of Litchfield and chaplain to Henry the eighth, bore the same office. MSS. Wood, Litchfield. D. 7. Ashmol. Nicholas Townley clerk, was master of the works at Cardinal College. MS. Twyne, 8. f. 351. Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also Wal∣pole, i. Anecd. Paint. p. 40.</NOTE>: who maintained,

among other things, that the clergy should not pos∣sess estates, that the ecclesiastical ceremonies obstructed true devotion, and that mendicant friars, the particular object of our Plowman's CREDE, were a public and insupportable grievance. But Wickliffe, whom Mr. Hume pronounces to have been an enthusiast, like many other reformers, carried his ideas of purity too far; and, as at least it appears from the two first of these opinions, under the design of destroying superstition, his undistinguishing zeal attacked even the necessary aids of religion. It was certainly a lucky circumstance, that Wickliffe quarrelled with the pope. His attacks on superstition at first probably proceeded from resentment. Wickliffe, who was professor of divinity at Oxford, finding on many occasions not only his own pro∣vince invaded, but even the privileges of the university fre∣quently violated by the pretensions of the mendicants, gra∣tified his warmth of temper by throwing out some slight censures against all the four orders, and the popes their principal patrons and abettors. Soon afterwards he was deprived of the wardenship of Canterbury hall, by the arch∣bishop of Canterbury, who substituted a monk in his place. Upon this he appealed to the pope, who confirmed the archie∣piscopal sentence, by way of rebuke for the freedom with which he had treated the monastic profession. Wickliffe, highly exasperated at this usage, immediately gave a loose to his indignation, and without restraint or distinction attacked
<PB N="308" REF="475"/>
in numerous sermons and treatises, not only the scandalous enormities of the whole body of monks, but even the usur∣pations of the pontifical power itself, with other ecclesiastical corruptions. Having exposed these palpable abuses with a just abhorrence, he ventured still farther, and proceeded to examine and refute with great learning and penetration the absurd doctrines which prevailed in the religious system of his age: he not only exhorted the laity to study the scriptures, but translated the bible into English for general use and popular inspection. Whatever were his motives, it is certain t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at these efforts enlarged the notions of mankind, and sowed those seeds of a revolution in religion, which were quickened at length and brought to maturity by a favourable coinci∣dence of circumstances, in an age when the encreasing growth of literature and curiosity naturally led the way to innovation and improvement. But a visible diminution of the authority of the ecclesiastics, in England at least, had been long growing from other causes. The disgust which the laity had contracted from the numerous and arbitrary en∣croachments both of the court of Rome, and of their own clergy, had greatly weaned the kingdom from superstition; and conspicuous symptoms had appeared, on various occa∣sions, of a general desire to shake off the intolerable bondage of papal oppression.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding what has been supposed above, it is not quite certain, that Longland was the first who led the way in this singular species of versification. His VISION was written on a popular subject, and is the only poem, composed in this capricious sort of metre, which has been printed. It is easy to conceive how these circumstances contributed to give him the merit of an inventor on this occasion.</P>
<P>The ingenious doctor Percy has exhibited specimens of two or three other poems belonging to this class <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Essay on the Metr. of P. P. Vis. p. 8. seq.</NOTE>. One of these is entitled DEATH AND LIFE: it consists of two hun∣dred and twenty-nine lines, and is divided into two parts or <HI>Fitts.</HI> It begins thus:</P>
<Q><L>Christ christen king that on the cross tholed,</L>
<L>Hadde paines and passyons to defend our soules;</L>
<L>Give us grace on the ground the greatlye to serve</L>
<L>For that royall red blood that rann from thy side.</L></Q>
<P>The subject of this piece is a VISION, containing a contest for superiority between <HI>Our lady Dame</HI> LIFE, and the <HI>ugly fiend</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="480"/>
<HI>Dame</HI> DEATH: who with their several attributes and conco∣mitants are personified in a beautiful vein of allegorical paint∣ing. <HI>Dame</HI> LIFE is thus forcibly described.</P>
<Q><L>Shee was brighter of her blee than was the bright sonn:</L>
<L>Her rud redder than the rose that on the rise hangeth:</L>
<L>Meekely smiling with her mouth, and merry in her lookes;</L>
<L>Ever laughing for love, as shee like would:</L>
<L>And as she came by the bankes the boughes eche one</L>
<L>They lowted to that ladye and layd forth their branches;</L>
<L>Blossomes and burgens breathed full sweete,</L>
<L>Flowers flourished in the frith where she forth stepped,</L>
<L>And the grasse that was gray grened belive.</L></Q>
<P>The figure of DEATH follows, which is equally bold and expressive. Another piece of this kind, also quoted by doc∣tor Percy, is entitled CHEVELERE ASSIGNE, or DE CIGNE, that is the <HI>Knight of the Swan.</HI> This is a romance which is extant in a prose translation from the French, among Mr. Garrick's noble collection of old plays <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">K. vol. 10. <Q REND="inline">"Imprinted at London by me Wylliam Copland."</Q> There is an edition on parchment by W. de Worde, 1512. <Q REND="inline">"Newly translated out of Frenshe into Englyshe at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt prynce lorde Edward duke of Buckynghame."</Q> Here I understand French prose.</NOTE>.

<P>This alliterative measure, unaccompanied with rhyme, and including many peculiar Saxon idioms appropriated to poetry, remained in use so low as the sixteenth century. In doctor Percy's <HI>Antient Ballads,</HI> there is one of this class called THE SCOTTISH FEILDE, containing a very circumstantial narrative of the battle of Flodden fought in the year 1513.</P>
<P>In some of the earliest of our specimens of old English poetry <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See Sect. i.</NOTE>, we have long ago seen that alliteration was esteemed a fashionable and favourite ornament of verse.

<P>ALTHOUGH this work is professedly confined to England, yet I cannot pass over two Scotch poets of this period, who have adorned the English language by a strain of versification, expression, and poetical imagery, far superior to their age; and who consequently deserve to be mentioned in a general review of the progress of our national poetry. They have written two heroic poems. One of them is John Barbour, archdeacon of Aberdeen. He was edu∣cated at Oxford; and Rymer has printed an instrument for his safe passage into England, in order to prosecute his studies in that university, in the years 1357 and 1365 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. vi. 31. 478.</NOTE>.

Beside the earl a little by,</L>
<L>They sembled all so hardily,</L>

<L>For with weapons stallwort of steel,</L>
<L>They dang on them with all their might,</L>
<L>Their foes received well, I heght,</L>
<L>With swords and spears, and als with mass,</L>
<L>The battle there so fellon was,</L>
<L>And so right great spilling of blood,</L>
<L>That on the erd the slouces stood.</L>
<L>The Scottishmen so well them bare,</L>
<L>And so great slaughter made they there,</L>
<L>And fra so feil the lives they reav'd,</L>
<L>That all the field was bloody leav'd.</L>

To keep the wood while it wa, day they thought.</L>
<L>As Wallace thus in the thick forest sought,</L>
<L>For his two men in mind he had great pain,</L>
<L>He wist not well, if they were tane or slain,</L>
<L>Or scaped haill by any jeopardy.</L>
<L>Thirteen were left with him, no more had he;</L>

<L>Fire got they soon, but meat then had they nane;</L>
<L>Two sheep they took beside them of a fold,</L>

<L>Graithed in haste some food for them to dight:</L>
<L>So heard they blow rude horns upon hight.</L>
<L>Two sent he forth to look what it might be;</L>
<L>They bode right long, and no tidings heard he,</L>
<L>But bousteous noise so bryvely blowing fast;</L>
<L>So other two into the wood forth past.</L>
<L>None came again, but bousteously can blaw,</L>
<L>Into great ire he sent them forth on raw.</L>
<L>When that alone Wallace was leaved there,</L>
<L>The awful blast abounded meikle mare;</L>
<L>Then trow'd he well they had his lodging seen;</L>
<L>His sword he drew of noble metal keen,</L>
<L>Syne forth he went where at he heard the horn.</L>
<L>Without the door Fawdoun was him beforn,</L>
<L>As to his sight, his own head in his hand;</L>
<L>A cross he made when he saw him so stand.</L>
<L>At Wallace in the head he swakked there,</L>
<L>And he in haste soon hint it by the hair,</L>
<L>Syne out again at him he could it cast,</L>
<L>Into his heart he greatly was agast.</L>
<L>Right well he trow'd that was do sprit of man,</L>

<L>He wist uo wale there longer for to bide.</L>
<L>Up through the hail thus wight Wallace can glide,</L>
<L><PB N="326" REF="493"/>
To a close stair, the boards they rave in twin,</L>
<L>Fifteen foot large he lap out of that inn.</L>
<L>Up the water he suddenly could fare,</L>

<L>Trust right well that all this was sooth indeed,</L>

<L>I cannot speak of sik divinity,</L>

<P>About the present period, historical romances of recent events seem to have commenced. Many of these appear to have been written by heralds <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See Le Pere Mene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rier, Cheval. An∣cien. c. v. p. 225. Par. 12<SUP>mo</SUP>.</NOTE>. In the library of Worcester college at Oxford, there is a poem in French, reciting the atchievements of Edward the Black Prince, who died in the year 1376. It is in the short verse of romance, and was written by the prince's herald, who attended close by his person in all his battles, according to the established mode of those times. This was John Chandois-herald, frequently mentioned in Froissart. In this piece, which is of consider∣able length, the names of the Englishmen are properly spelled, the chronology exact, and the epitaph <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">It is a fair and beautiful manuscript on vellum. It is an oblong octavo, and for∣merly belonged to Sir William Le Neve Clarencieux herald.</NOTE>, forming a sort of peroration to the narrative, the same as was ordered by the prince in his will <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The hero's epitaph is frequent in ro∣mances. In the French romance of SAINTRE, written about this time, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> epitaph is introduced.</NOTE>. This poem, indeed, may seem to claim no place here, because it happens to be written in the French language: yet, exclusive of its subject, a circumstance I have mentioned, that it was composed by a herald, deserves particular attention, and throws no small illustration on the poetry of this era. There are several proofs which indicate that many romances of the fourteenth century, if not in verse, at least those written <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>n</SUP> p. 150.</NOTE>
<PB N="332" REF="499"/>
in prose, were the work of heralds. As it was their duty to attend their masters in battle, they were enabled to record the most important transactions of the field with fidelity. It was customary to appoint none to this office but persons of discernment, address, experience, and some degree of education <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Le Pere Menestrier Cheval. Ancien. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t supr. p. 225. ch. v. <Q REND="inline">"Que l'on croyoit avoir <HI>l'Esprit,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> Feron says, that they gave this attendance in order to make a true report.

<P>In the FLOURE and the LEAF, the same poet has de∣scribed, in eleven long stanzas, the procession to a splendid tournament, with all the prolixity and exactness of a herald <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">From v. 204. to v. 287.</NOTE>. The same affectation, derived from the same sources, occurs often in Ariosto.</P>
<P>It were easy to illustrate this doctrine by various examples. The famous French romance of SAINTRE was evidently the performance of a herald. John De Saintre, the knight of the piece, was a real person, and, according to Froissart, was taken prisoner at the battle of Poitiers, in the year 1356 <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Froissart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hist. i. p. 178.</NOTE>. But the compiler confounds chronology, and ascribes to his hero many pieces of true history belonging to others. This was a common practice in these books. Some au∣thors have supposed that this romance appeared before the year 1380 <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bysshe, Not. in Upton. Milit. Offic. p. 56. Menestrier, Orig. Arm. p. 23.</NOTE>. But there are reasons to prove, that it was written by Antony de la Sale, a Burgundian, author of a book of CEREMONIES, from his name very quaintly entitled LA SALLADE, and frequently cited by our learned antiquary Selden <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Tit. Hon. p. 413, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This Antony came into England to see the solemnity

I have not seen any French romance which has preserved the practices of chivalry more copiously than this of SAINTRE. It must have been an absolute master-piece for the rules of tilting, martial customs, and public ceremonies prevailing in its author's age. In the library of the Office of Arms, there remains a very accurate description of a feast of Saint George, celebrated at Windsor in 1471 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MSS. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic. Arm. M. 15. fol. 12. 13.</NOTE>. It appears to have been written by the herald Blue-mantle Poursuivant.

The pompous circumstances of which these heraldic narratives consisted, and the minute prolixity with which they were displayed, seem to have infected the professed historians of this age. Of this there are various instances in Froissart, who had no other design than to compile a chronicle of real facts. I will give one example out of many. At a treaty of marriage between our Richard the second and Isabel daughter of Charles the fifth king of France, the two monarchs, attended with a noble retinue, met and formed several encampments in a spacious plain, near the castle of Guynes. Froissart expends many pages in relating at large the costly furniture of the pavilions, the riches of the side-boards, the profusion and variety of sumptuous liquors, spices, and dishes, with their order of service, the number of the attendants, with their address and exact discharge of duty in their respective offices, the presents of gold and precious stones made on both sides, and a thousand other particulars of equal importance, relating to the parade of this royal interview <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See Froissart's CRONYCLE, translated by Lord Berners. Pinson, 1523. vol. ii. f. 242.</NOTE>. On this account, Cax∣ton, in his exhortation to the knights of his age, ranks Froissart's history, as a book of chivalry, with the romances of Lancelot and Percival; and recommends it to their attention, as a manual equally calculated to inculcate

This indeed was in an age when not only the courts of princes, but the castles of barons, vied with one another in the lustre of their shews: when tournaments, coronations, royal inter∣views, and solemn festivals, were the grand objects of man∣kind. Froissart was an eye-witness of many of the ceremo∣nies which he describes. His passion seems to have been that of seeing magnificent spectacles, and of hearing reports concerning them <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">His father was a painter of armories. This might give him an early turn for shews. See M. de la Curne de S. Palaye, Mem. Lit. tom. x. p. 664. edit. 4<SUP>to</SUP>.</NOTE>.

Froissart will be mentioned again as a poet.</NOTE>. This turn, it must

be confessed, might have some share in communicating that romantic cast to his history which I have mentioned. During his abode at the court of the earl of Foix, where he was en∣tertained for twelve weeks, he presented to the earl his col∣lection of the poems of the duke of Luxemburgh, consisting of sonnets, balades, and virelays. Among these was included a romance, composed by himself, called, MELIADER, or THE KNIGHT OF THE SUN OF GOLD.

<P>As we are approaching to Chaucer, let us here stand still, and take a retrospect of the general manners. The tourna∣ments and carousals of our antient princes, by forming splendid assemblies of both sexes, while they inculcated the most liberal sentiments of honour and heroism, undoubtedly contributed to introduce ideas of courtesy, and to encou∣rage decorum. Yet the national manners still retained a great degree of ferocity, and the ceremonies of the most refined courts in Europe had often a mixture of barbarism, which rendered them ridiculous. This absurdity will always appear at periods when men are so far civilised as to have lost their native simplicity, and yet have not attained just ideas of politeness and propriety. Their luxury was inelegant, their pleasures indelicate, their pomp cumbersome and un∣wieldy. In the mean time it may seem surprising, that the many schools of philosophy which flourished in the middle ages, should not have corrected and polished the times. But as their religion was corrupted by superstition, so their philosophy degenerated into sophistry. Nor is it science alone, even if founded on truth, that will polish nations.
<PB N="340" REF="507"/>
For this purpose, the powers of imagination must be awakened and exerted, to teach elegant feelings, and to heighten our natural sensibilities. It is not the head only that must be informed, but the heart must also be moved. Many classic authors were known in the thirteenth century, but the scholars of that period wanted taste to read and admire them. The pathetic or sublime strokes of Virgil would be but little relished by theologists and metaphy∣sicians.</P>

<P>THE most illustrious ornament of the reign of Edward the third, and of his successor Richard the second, was Jeffrey Chaucer; a poet with whom the history of our poetry is by many supposed to have commenced; and who has been pronounced, by a critic of unquestionable taste and discernment, to be the first English versifier who wrote poetically <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Johnson's DICTION. Pref. p. 1.</NOTE>. He was born in the year 1328, and educated at Oxford, where he made a rapid progress in the scholastic sciences as they were then taught: but the liveliness of his parts, and the native gaiety of his disposition, soon recom∣mended him to the patronage of a magnificent monarch, and rendered him a very popular and acceptable character in the brilliant court which I have above described. In the mean time, he added to his accomplishments by frequent tours into France and Italy, which he sometimes visited under the advantages of a public character. Hitherto our poets had been persons of a private and circumscribed edu∣cation, and the art of versifying, like every other kind of composition, had been confined to recluse scholars. But Chaucer was a man of the world: and from this circum∣stance we are to account, in great measure, for the many new embellishments which he conferred on our language and our poetry. The descriptions of splendid processions and gallant carousals, with which his works abound, are a proof that he was conversant with the practices and diversions of polite life. Familiarity with a variety of things and objects, opportunities of acquiring the fashionable and courtly modes
<PB N="342" REF="509"/>
of speech, connections with the great at home, and a per∣sonal acquaintance with the vernacular poets of foreign countries, opened his mind and furnished him with new lights <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The earl of Salisbury, beheaded by Henry the fourth, could not but patronise Chaucer. I do not mean for political rea∣sons. The earl was a writer of verses, and very fond of poetry. On this account, his acquaintance was much cultivated by the famous Christina of Pisa; whose works, both in prose and verse, compose so consi∣derable a part of the old French literature. She used to call him, <Q REND="inline">"Gracieux chevalier, aimant dictiez, et lui-meme gracieux dic∣teur."</Q> See M. Boivin, Mem. Lit. tom. ii. p. 767. seq. 4<SUP>to</SUP>. I have seen none of this earl's <HI>Ditties.</HI> Otherwise he would have been here considered in form, as an English poet.</NOTE>. In Italy he was introduced to Petrarch, at the wedding of Violante, daughter of Galeazzo duke of Milan, with the duke of Clarence: and it is not improbable that Boccacio was of the party <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Froissart was also present.

Although Chaucer had un∣doubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante, before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables. His travels likewise enabled him to cultivate the Italian and Provencial languages with the greatest success; and induced him to polish the asperity, and enrich the sterility of his native versification, with softer cadences, and a more copious and variegated phraseology. In this attempt, which was authorised by the recent and popular examples of Petrarch in Italy and Alain Chartier in France <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Leland Script. Brit. 421.</NOTE>, he was countenanced and assisted by his friend John Gower, the early guide and encourager of his studies <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gower, Confess. Amant. l. v. fol. 190. b.

<PB N="343" REF="510"/>
not yet been studied. The writers therefore of such periods are chiefly and very usefully employed in importing the ideas of other languages into their own. They do not venture to think for themselves, nor aim at the merit of inventors, but they are laying the foundations of literature: and while they are naturalising the knowledge of more learned ages and countries by translation, they are imperceptibly improving the national language. This has been remarkably the case, not only in England, but in France and Italy. In the year 1387, John Trevisa canon of Westbury in Wiltshire, and a great traveller, not only finished a translation of the Old and New Testaments, at the command of his munificent patron Thomas lord Berkley <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See H. Wharton, Append. Cav. p. 49.</NOTE>, but also translated Higden's POLYCHRONICON, and other Latin pieces <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Such as Bartholomew Hantwille De <HI>Propri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibus Rerum,</HI> lib. xix.

He also translated some pieces of Richard Fitzralph, archbishop of Armagh. See supr. p. 291. He wrote a tract, prefixed to his version of the POLYCHRONICON, on the utility of translations. <HI>De Utilitate Translationum, Dialogus int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Clericum et Patronum.</HI> See more of his translations in MSS. Harl. 1900. I do not find his ENGLISH BIBLE in any of our libraries, nor do I believe that any copy of it now remains. Caxton mentions it in the preface to his edition of the English POLYCHRONICON.</NOTE>. But these trans∣lations would have been alone insufficient to have produced or sustained any considerable revolution in our language: the great work was reserved for Gower and Chaucer. Wickliffe had also translated the bible <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">It is observable, that he made his translation from the vulgate Latin version of Jerom. It was finished 1383. See MS. Cod. Bibl. Coll. Eman. Cant. 102.</NOTE>: and in other respects his attempts to bring about a reformation in religion at this time proved beneficial to English literature. The orthodox divines of this period generally wrote in Latin: but Wickliffe, that his arguments might be familiarised to common readers and the bulk of the people, was obliged to compose in English his numerous theological treatises against the papal corrup∣tions. Edward the third, while he perhaps intended only to banish a badge of conquest, greatly contributed to establish
<PB N="344" REF="511"/>
the national diaiect, by abolishing the use of the Nor∣man tongue in the public acts and judicial proceedings, as we have before observed, and by substituting the natural lan∣guage of the country. But Chaucer manifestly first taught his countrymen to write English; and formed a style by naturalising words from the Provencial, at that time the most polished dialect of any in Europe, and the best adapted to the purposes of poetical expression.</P>
<P>It is certain that Chaucer abounds in classical allusions: but his poetry is not formed on the antient models. He appears to have been an universal reader, and his learning is sometimes mistaken for genius: but his chief sources were the French and Italian poets. From these originals two of his capital poems, the KNIGHT'S TALE <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>Chaucer alludes to some book from whence this tale was taken, more than once, viz. v. 1. <Q REND="inline">"Whilom, as <HI>olde stories</HI> tellin us."</Q> v. 1465. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>As</HI> olde bookes <HI>to us saine, that</HI> all this storie telleth more plain."</Q> v. 2814. <Q REND="inline">"Of soulis fynd I nought in this <HI>registre.</HI>"</Q> That is, this History, or narrative.

<P>Boccacio was the disciple of Petrarch: and although prin∣cipally known and deservedly celebrated as a writer or in∣ventor of tales, he was by his cotemporaries usually placed in the third rank after Dante and Petrarch. But Boccacio having seen the Platonic sonnets of his master Petrarch, in a fit of despair committed all his poetry to the flames <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Goujet, Bibl. Fr. Tom. vii. p. 328.

<PB N="345" REF="512"/>
its author but a slender proportion of that eminent degree of poetical reputation, which he might have justly claimed from so extraordinary a performance. It is an heroic poem, in twelve books, entitled LE TESEIDE, and written in the octave stanza, called by the Italians <HI>ottava rima,</HI> which Boc∣cacio adopted from the old French chansons, and here first introduced among his countrymen <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See Crescimben. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor. Volgar. Poes. vol. i. L. i. p. 65. Ven. 1731. 4<SUP>to</SUP>.</NOTE>. It was printed at Fer∣rara, but with some deviations from the original, and even misrepresentations of the story, in the year 1475 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Poema della TESEIDE del Boccacio chiosato, e dichia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ato du Andrea de Bassi in Ferrara, 1475. fol.</NOTE>.

<P>Whether Boccacio was the inventor of the story of this poem is a curious enquiry. It is certain that Theseus was an early hero of romance <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">In Lydgate's TEMPLE OF GLAS, never printed, among the lovers painted on the wall is The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eus killing the Mino∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aure.

In the royal library at Paris, there is a manuscript entitled, The ROMAN DE THESEUS ET DE GA∣DIFER <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">MSS. Bibl. [Reg. Paris.] Tom. ii. 974. E.</NOTE>.

But whether or no this prose HISTOIRE DU CHEVALIER THESEUS is the story of Theseus in question, or whether this is the same Theseus, I cannot ascertain. There is likewise in the same royal library a manuscript, called by Montfaucon, HIS∣TORIA THESEI IN LINGUA VULGARI, in ten books <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Bibl. MSS. ut supr. p. 773.</NOTE>. The Abbe Goujet observes, that there is in some libraries of France an old French translation of Boccacio's THESEID, from which Anna de Graville formed the French poem of PALA∣MON and ARCITE, at the command of queen Claude, wife of Francis the first, about the year 1487 <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ut supr. p. 329.</NOTE>. Either the transla∣tion used by Anna de Graville, or her poem, is perhaps the second of the manuscripts mentioned by Montfaucon.

I confess I am of opinion, that Boccacio's THESEID is an original composition. But there is a Greco-barbarous poem extant on this subject, which, if it could be proved to be antecedent in point of time to the Italian poem, would de∣grade Boccacio to a mere translator on this occasion. It is a matter that deserves to be examined at large, and to be traced with accuracy.</P>
<P>This Greek poem is as little known and as scarce as Boc∣cacio's THESEID. It is entitled, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It was printed in quarto at Venice in the year 1529. <HI>Stam∣pata in Vinegia per Giovanantonio et fratelli da Sabbio a requisitione de M. Damiano de Santa Maria de Spici</HI> M. D.

It is not mentioned by Crusius or Fabricius; but is often cited by Du Cange in his Greek glossary, under the title, DE NUPTIIS THESEI ET AEMILIAE. The heads of the chapters are adorned with rude wooden cuts of the story. I once suspected that Boccacio, having received this poem from some of his learned friends among the Grecian exiles, who being driven from Constantinople took refuge in Italy about the fourteenth century, translated it into Italian. Under this supposition, I was indeed surprised to find the ideas of chivalry, and the ceremonies of a tournament minutely de∣scribed, in a poem which appeared to have been written at Constantinople. But this difficulty was soon removed, when I recollected that the Franks, Venetians, and Germans had been in possession of that city for more than one hundred years; and that Baldwin earl of Flanders was elected emperor of Constantinople in the year 1204, and was succeeded by four Latin or Frankish emperors, down to the year 1261 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">About which period it is probable that the anonymous Greek poem, called the <HI>Loves of Lybister and Rhodamna,</HI> was writ∣ten.

He adds, <Q REND="inline">"et mu∣sicae testudines."</Q> It is written in the iambic measure mentioned below. It is a series of wandering adventures with little art or invention.

He meets Clitophon son of a king of Armenia. They undergo various dangers in different countries. Ly∣bister relates his dream concerning a par∣tridge and an eagle; and how from that dream he fell in love with Rhodamna daughter of Chyses a pagan king, and communicated his passion by sending an arrow, to which his name was affixed, into a tower, or castle, called Argyrocastre, &amp;c.

From the same communication likewise, I mean the Greek exiles, I fancied Boccacio might have procured the stories of several of his tales in the DECA∣MERON: as, for instance, that of CYMON and IPHIGENIA, where the names are entirely Grecian, and the scene laid in Rhodes, Cyprus, Crete, and other parts of Greece belonging

to the imperial territory <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Giorn. v. Nov. 1.</NOTE>. But, to say no more of this, I have at present no sort of doubt of what I before asserted, that Boccacio is the writer and inventor of this piece. Our Greek poem is in fact a literal translation from the Italian THESEID. It consists of twelve books, and is written in Boccacio's octave stanza, the two last lines of every stanza rhyming together. The verses are of the iambic kind, and something like the VERSUS POLITICI, which were common among the Greek scholars a little before and long after Con∣stantinople was taken by the Turks, in the year 1443. It will readily be allowed, that the circumstance of the stanzas and rhymes is very singular in a poem composed in the Greek language, and is alone sufficient to prove this piece to be a translation from Boccacio. I must not forget to ob∣serve, that the Greek is extremely barbarous, and of the lowest period of that language.</P>
<P>It was a common practice of the learned and indigent Greeks, who frequented Italy and the neighbouring states about the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, to translate the popular pieces of Italian poetry, and the romances or tales most in vogue, into these Greco-barbarous iambics <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">That is <HI>versus politici</HI> abovementioned, a sort of loose iambic. See Langii PHI∣LOLOGIA GRAECO-BARBARA. Tzetes's Chiliads are written in this versification. See Du Cange, Gl. Gr. ii. col. 1. 96.</NOTE>. PASTOR FIDO was thus translated. The romance of AL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>XANDER THE GREAT was also translated in the same manner by Deme∣trius Zenus, who flourished in 1530, under the title of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and printed at Venice in the year 1529 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Crus. ut supr. p. 373. 399.

In passing through Chaucer's hands, this poem has received many new beauties. Not only those capital fictions and de∣sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iptions, the temples of Mars, Venus, and Diana, with their allegorical paintings, and the figures of Lycurgus and Emetrius with their retinue, are so much heightened by the bold and spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed manner of the British bard, as to strike us with an air of originality. In the mean time it is to be re∣marked, that as Chaucer in some places has thrown in strokes of his own, so in others he has contracted the un∣interesting and tedious prolixity of narrative, which he found in the Italian poet. And that he might avoid a servile imi∣tation, and indulge himself as he pleased in an arbitrary departure from the original, it appears that he neglected the embarrassment of Boccacio's stanza, and preferred the En∣glish heroic couplet, of which this poem affords the first conspicuous example extant in our language.</P>

This groupe is the effort of a strong imagination, unac∣quainted with selection and arrangement of images. It is rudely thrown on the canvas without order or art.

I think Statius is copied in a simile, v. 1640. The introduction of this poem is also taken from the Thebaid, xii. 545. 481. 797. Compare Chaucer's lines, v. 870. seq. v. 917. seq. v. 996. seq. The funeral pyre of Arcite is also translated from Theb. vi. 195. seq. See Ch. v. 2940. seq. I likewise take this opportunity of observing, that Lucretius and Plato are imitated in this poem. Together with many passages from Ovid and Virgil.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>Statius was a favourite writer with the poets of the middle ages. His bloated magnificence of description, gi∣gantic images, and pompous diction, suited their taste, and were somewhat of a piece with the romances they so much admired. They neglected the gentler and genuine graces of Virgil, which they could not relish. His pictures were too correctly and chastly drawn to take their fancies: and truth of design, elegance of expression, and the arts of compo∣sition,
<PB N="362" REF="529"/>
were not their objects <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Troilus and Cresside</HI> he has translated the arguments of the twelve books of the The∣baid of Statius. See B. v. p. 1479. seq.</NOTE>. In the mean time we must observe, that in Chaucer's Temple of Mars many personages are added: and that those which existed before in Statius have been retouched, enlarged, and rendered more distinct and pic∣turesque by Boccacio and Chaucer. Arcite's address to Mars, at entering the temple, has great dignity, and is not copied from Statius.</P>

<P>We are surprised to find, in a poet of such antiquity, numbers so nervous and flowing: a circumstance which greatly contributed to render Dryden's paraphrase of this poem the most animated and harmonious piece of versifi∣cation in the English language. I cannot leave the KNIGHT'S TALE without remarking, that the inventor of this poem, appears to have possessed considerable talents for the artificial construction of a story. It exhibits unexpected and striking turns of fortune; and abounds in those incidents which are calculated to strike the fancy by opening resources to sublime description, or interest the heart by pathetic situa∣tions. On this account, even without considering the poetical and exterior ornaments of the piece, we are hardly disgusted with the mixture of manners, the confusion of times, and the like violations of propriety, which this poem, in common with all others of its age, presents in almost every page. The action is supposed to have happened soon after the marriage of Theseus with Hippolita, and the death of Creon in the siege of Thebes: but we are soon transported into more recent periods. Sunday, the celebration of matins, judicial astrology, heraldry, tilts and tournaments, knights of Eng∣land, and targets of Prussia <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">The knights of the Teutonic order were settled in Prussia, before 1300.

<P>CHAUCER'S ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE is translated from a French poem entitled, LE ROMAN DE LA ROSE. It was begun by William of Lorris, a student in jurispru∣dence, who died about the year 1260 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fauchet, p. 198.</NOTE>. Being left unfinished, it was completed by John of Meun, a native of a little town of that name, situated on the river Loire near Orleans, who seems to have flourished about the year 1310 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. p. 200. He also translated Boethius <HI>De Consolatione,</HI> and <HI>Abelard's Letters,</HI> and wrote <HI>Answers of the Sybills,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>. This poem is esteemed by the French the most valuable piece of their old poetry. It is far beyond the rude efforts of all their preceding romancers: and they have nothing equal to it before the reign of Francis the first, who died in the year 1547. But there is a considerable difference in the merit of the two authors. William of Lorris, who wrote not one quarter of the poem, is remarkable for his elegance and luxuriance of description, and is a beautiful painter of allegorical personages. John of Meun is a writer of ano∣ther cast. He possesses but little of his predecessor's inven∣tive and poetical vein; and in that respect was not properly qualified to finish a poem begun by William of Lorris. But he has strong satire, and great liveliness <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>The poem consists of 22734 verses. William of Lorris's part ends with v. 4149. viz.</P>
<Q><L>"A peu que je ne m'en desespoir."</L></Q></NOTE>. He was one of the wits of the court of Charles le Bel.</P>
<P>The difficulties and dangers of a lover, in pursuing and obtaining the object of his desires, are the literal argument of this poem. This design is couched under the allegory of
<PB N="369" REF="536"/>
a Rose, which our lover after frequent obstacles gathers in a delicious garden. He traverses vast ditches, scales lofty walls, and forces the gates of adamantine and almost impregnable castles. These enchanted fortresses are all inhabited by vari∣ous divinities; some of which assist, and some oppose, the lover's progress <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In the preface of the edition printed in the year 1538, all this allegory is turned to religion. The Rose is proved to be a state of grace, or divine wisdom, or eternal beatitude, or the Holy Virgin to which heretics cannot gain access. It is the white Rose of Jericho, <HI>Quasi plantatio Ros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Jericho,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. The chemists, in the mean time, made it a search for the Philo∣sopher's Stone: and other professions, with laboured commentaries, explained it into their own respective sciences.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Chaucer has luckily translated all that was written by William of Lorris <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See Occleve's <HI>Letter of Cupide,</HI> writ∣ten 1402. Urry's <HI>Chaucer,</HI> p. 536. v. 283.

<Q><L>"Vous aurez absolution."</L></Q>
<P>But Chaucer has made several omissions in John of Meun's part, before he comes to this period. He has translated all William of Lorris's part, as I have observed; and his translation of that part ends with v. 4432. viz.</P>
<Q><L>"Than shuldin I fallin in wanhope."</L></Q>
<P>Chaucer's cotemporaries called his <HI>Ro∣mant of the Rose,</HI> a translation. Lydgate says that Chaucer</P>
<Q><L>—Notably did his businesse</L>
<L>By grete avyse his wittes to dispose,</L>
<L>To <HI>translate</HI> the ROMANS OF THE ROSE.</L></Q>
<P>Prol. Boch. st. vi. It is manifest that Chaucer took no pains to disguise his translation. He literally follows the French, in saying, that a river was <Q REND="inline">"lesse than <HI>Saine.</HI>"</Q> i. e. the Seine at Paris. v. 118. <Q REND="inline">"No wight in all Paris."</Q> v. 7157. A grove has more birds <Q REND="inline">"than ben in all the relme of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> </Q>v. 495. He calls a pine, <Q REND="inline">"A tree in <HI>France</HI> men call a pine."</Q> v. 1457. He says of roses, <Q REND="inline">"so faire werin nevir in <HI>Rone.</HI>"</Q> v. 1674. <Q REND="inline">"That for Paris ne for Pavie."</Q> v. 1654. He has sometimes reference to French ideas, or words, not in the original. As <Q REND="inline">"Men clepin hem Sereins in France."</Q> v. 684. <Q REND="inline">"From Jerusalem to Burgoine."</Q> v. 554. <Q REND="inline">"Grein de Paris."</Q> v. 1369. Where Skin∣ner says, <HI>Paris</HI> is contracted for <HI>Paradise.</HI> In mentioning minstrells and juglers, he says, that some of them <Q REND="inline">"Songin songes of Loraine."</Q> v. 776. He adds,
<Q><L>For in Loraine there notis be</L>
<L>Full swetir than <HI>in this contre.</HI></L></Q>
There is not a syllable of these songs, and singers, of Loraine, in the French. By the way, I suspect that Chaucer translated this poem while he was at Paris. There are also many allusions to English affairs, which I suspected to be Chaucer's; but they are all in the French original. Such as, <Q REND="inline">"Hornpipis of Cornevaile."</Q> v. 4250. These are called in the original, <Q REND="inline">"Chale∣meaux de Cornouaille."</Q> v. 3991. A knight is introduced, allied to king <Q REND="inline">"Ar∣thour of Bretaigne."</Q> v. 1199. Who is called, <Q REND="inline">"Bon roy Artus de Bretaigne."</Q> Orig. v. 1187. Sir Gawin, and Sir Kay, two of Arthur's knights, are characterised, v. 2206. seq. See Orig. v. 2124. Where the word <HI>Keulx</HI> is corrupt for Keie. But there is one passage, in which he mentions a <HI>Bachelere</HI> as fair as <Q REND="inline">"The Lordis sonne of Windisore."</Q> v. 1250. This is added by Chaucer, and intended as a compliment to some of his patrons. In the <HI>Legende of good Women,</HI> Cupid says to Chaucer, v. 329.</P>

One of the most striking pictures in the style of allegorical personifica∣tion, which occurs in Chaucer's translation of the additional part, is much heightened by Chaucer, and indeed owes all its merit to the translator; whose g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nius was much better adapted to this species of painting than that of John of Meun, the continuator of the poem.</P>

<P>The fiction that Sickness, Melancholy, and other beings of the like sort, were counsellors in the palace of OLD AGE, and employed in telling her day and night, that <Q REND="inline">"DEATH stood <HI>armed</HI> at her gate,"</Q> was far beyond the sentimental and satirical vein of John of Meun, and is conceived with great vigour of imagination.</P>
<P>Chaucer appears to have been early struck with this French poem. In his DREME, written long before he begun this translation, he supposes, that the chamber in which he slept was richly painted with the story of the ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">v. 322. Chaucer alludes to this poem in The MARCHAUNT'S TALE, v. 1548. p. 72. Urr.</NOTE>. It is natural to imagine, that such a poem must have been a favorite with Chaucer. No poet, before William of Lorris, either Italian or French, had delineated allegorical personages in so distinct and enlarged a style, and with such a fullness of characteristical attributes: nor had descriptive poetry selected such a variety of circumstances, and disclosed such an exuberance of embellishment, in form∣ing agreeable representations of nature. On this account, we are surprised that Boileau should mention Villon as the first poet of France who drew form and order from the chaos of the old French romancers.</P>
<Q><L>Villon sçeut le PREMIER, dans ces siecles grossiers</L>
<L>Debroüiller l'ART CONFUS de nos vieux ROMANCIERS <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Art. Poet. ch. i. He died about the year 1456.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>But the poetry of William of Lorris was not the poetry of Boileau.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="550"/>
That this poem should not please Boileau, I can easily conceive. It is more surprising that it should have been censured as a contemptible performance by Petrarch, who lived in the age of fancy. Petrarch being desired by his friend Guy de Gonzague to send him some new piece, sent the ROMAN DE LA ROSE. With the poem, instead of an encomium, he returned a severe criticism; in which he treats it as a cold, inartificial, and extravagant composition: as a proof, how much France, who valued this poem as her chief work, was surpassed by Italy in eloquence and the arts of writing <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Petrarch. Carm. L. i. Ep. 30.</NOTE>. In this opinion we must attribute some∣thing to jealousy. But the truth is, Petrarch's genius was too cultivated to relish these wild excursions of imagination: his favorite classics, whom he revived, and studied with so much attention, ran in his head. Especially Ovid's ART OF LOVE, a poem of another species, and evidently formed on another plan; but which Petrarch had been taught to vene∣rate, as the model and criterion of a didactic poem on the passion of love reduced to a system. We may add, that al∣though the poem before us was founded on the visionary doctrines and refinements concerning love invented by the Provencial poets, and consequently less unlikely to be fa∣vourably received by Petrarch, yet his ideas on that delicate subject were much more Platonic and metaphysical.</P>

<P>CHAUCER'S poem of TROILUS and CRESSEIDE is said to be formed on an old history, written by Lollius, a native of Urbino in Italy <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Petrus Lambeccius enumerates Lollius Urbicus among the <HI>Historici Latini profani</HI> of the third century. Prodrom. p. 246. Hamb. 1659. See also Voss. Historic. La∣tin. ii. 2. p. 163. edit. Ludg. Bat. But this could not be Chaucer's Lollius. Chau∣cer places Lollius among the historians of Troy, in his House of Fame, iii. 380.

<P>Pathetic description is one of Chaucer's peculiar excellencies.</P>
<P>In this poem are various imitations from Ovid, which are of too particular and minute a nature to be pointed out here, and belong to the province of a professed and formal commentator on the piece.

Our author, from his excessive fondness for Statius, has been guilty of a very diverting and what may be called a double anachronism.

See Man. of L. T. v. 54. Urr. There was an old French Ro∣mance called PARTONEPEX, often cited by Du Cange and Carpentier. Gl. Lat. This is Parthenopeus, a hero of the Theban story.

<P>Whether the HOUSE OF FAME is Chaucer's invention, or suggested by any French or Italian poet, I cannot determine. But I am apt to think it was originally a Provencial compo∣sition, among other proofs, from this passage.</P>

<P>The Oyse is a river in Picardy, which falls into the river Seine, not many leagues from Paris. An Englishman would not have expressed distance by such an unfamiliar illustration. Unless we reconcile the matter, by supposing that Chaucer wrote this poem during his travels. There is another passage where the ideas are those of a foreign romance.

<P>This poem contains great strokes of Gothic imagination, yet

This aerial journey is partly copied from Ovid's Phaeton in the chariot of the sun. But the poet apologises for this extravagant fiction, and explains his meaning, by alledging the authority of Boethius; who says, that Contem∣plation may soar on the wings of Philosophy above every element. He likewise recollects, in the midst of his course, the description of the heavens, given by Marcianus Capella in his book <HI>De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii</HI> <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See The MARCHAUNT'S TALE, v. 1248. p. 70.

The northern side of the rock was alike covered with names; but being here shaded from the warmth of the sun, the characters remained unmelted and uneffaced.

The praises of each petitioner are then re∣sounded, according to the partial or capricious appointment of Fame; and equal merits obtain very different success. There is much satire and humour in these requests and re∣wards, and in the disgraces and honours which are indis∣criminately distributed by the queen, without discernment and by chance. The poet then enters the house or labyrinth of RUMOUR. It was built of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allow twigs, like a cage, and there∣fore admitted every sound. Its doors were also more numerous than leaves on the trees, and always stood open. These are romantic exaggerations of Ovid's inventions on the same subject. It was moreover sixty miles in length, and perpe∣tually turning round. From this house, says the poet, issued tidings of every kind, like fountains and rivers from the sea. Its inhabitants, who were eternally employed in hearing or telling news, together with the rise of reports, and the formation
<PB N="396" REF="563"/>
of lies are then humourously described: the com∣pany is chiefly composed of sailors, pilgrims, and pardoners. At length our author is awakened at seeing a venerable per∣sonage of great authority: and thus the Vision abruptly concludes.</P>
<P>Pope has imitated this piece, with his usual elegance of diction and harmony of versification. But in the mean time, he has not only misrepresented the story, but marred the character of the poem. He has endeavoured to correct it's extravagancies, by new refinements and additions of another cast: but he did not consider, that extravagancies are essential to a poem of such a structure, and even constitute it's beau∣ties. An attempt to unite order and exactness of imagery with a subject formed on principles so professedly romantic and anomalous, is like giving Corinthian pillars to a Gothic palace. When I read Pope's elegant imitation of this piece, I think I am walking among the modern monuments unsuitably placed in Westminster-abbey.</P>

<P>NOTHING can be more ingeniously contrived than the occasion on which Chaucer's CANTERBURY TALES are supposed to be recited. A company of pilgrims, on their journey to visit the shrine of Thomas a Beckett at Canterbury, lodge at the Tabarde-inn in Southwark. Al∣though strangers to each other, they are assembled in one room at supper, as was then the custom; and agree, not only to travel together the next morning, but to relieve the fatigue of the journey by telling each a story <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is an inn at Burford in Oxford∣shire, which accommodated pilgrims on their road to Saint Edward's shrine in the abbey of Gloucester. A long room, with a series of Gothic windows, still remains, which was their refectory. Leland men∣tions such another, Itin. ii. 70.</NOTE>. Chaucer undoubtedly intended to imitate Boccacio, whose DECAMERON was then the most popular of books, in writing a set of tales. But the circumstance invented by Boccacio, as the cause which gave rise to his DECAMERON, or the relation of his hundred stories <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that Boccacio chose a Greek title, that is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, for his Tales. He has also given Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k names to the ladies and gentlemen who recite the tales. His Eclogues are full of Greek words. This was natural at the revival of the Greek language.</NOTE>, is by no means so happily conceived as that of Chaucer for a similar purpose. Boccacio supposes, that when the plague began to abate at Florence, ten young per∣sons of both sexes retired to a country house, two miles from the city, with a design of enjoying fresh air, and passing ten days agreeably. Their principal and established amusement, instead of playing at chess after dinner, was for each to tell a tale. One superiority which, among others, Chaucer's plan afforded above that of Boccacio, was
<PB N="398" REF="565"/>
the opportunity of displaying a variety of striking and dra∣matic characters, which would not have easily met but on such an expedition. A circumstance which also contributed to give a variety to the stories. And for a number of persons in their situation, so natural, so practicable, so pleasant, I add so rational, a mode of entertainment could not have been imagined.</P>
<P>The CANTERBURY TALES are unequal, and of various merit. Few, if any, of the stories are perhaps the inven∣tion of Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cer. I have already spoken at large of the KNIGHT'S TALE, one of our author's noblest compositions <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The reader will excuse my irregularity in not considering it under the CANTER∣BURY TALES. I have here given the reason, which is my apology, in the text.</NOTE>. That of the CANTERBURY TALES, which deserves the next place, as written in the higher strain of poetry, and the poem by which Milton describes and characterises Chaucer, is the SQUIER'S TALE. The imagination of this story con∣sists in Arabian fiction engrafted on Gothic chivalry. Nor is this Arabian fiction purely the sport of arbitrary fancy: it is in great measure founded on Arabian learning. Cam∣buscan, a king of Tartary, celebrates his birth-day festival in the hall of his palace at Sarra, with the most royal mag∣nificence. In the midst of the solemnity, the guests are alarmed with a miraculous and unexpected spectacle: the minstrells cease on a sudden, and all the assembly is hushed in silence, surprise, and suspence.</P>

<L>For marveile of this knight him to behold <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">v. 96. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a fine romantic story of a Count de Macon: who, while revelling in his hall with many knights, is suddenly alarmed by the entrance of a gigantic figure of a black man, mounted on a black steed. This terrible stranger, without re∣ceiving any obstruction from guards or gates, rides directly forward to the high table; and, with an imperious tone, orders the count to follow him, &amp;c. Nic.

<P>These presents were sent by the king of Araby and Inde to Cambuscan in honour of his feast. The Horse of brass, on the skillful movement and management of certain secret springs, transported his rider into the most distant region of the world in the space of twenty-four hours; for, as the rider chose, he could fly in the air with the swiftness of an eagle: and again, as occasion required, he could stand mo∣tionless in opposition to the strongest force, vanish on a sud∣den at command, and return at his master's call. The Mir∣rour of glass was endued with the power of shewing any future disasters which might happen to Cambuscan's king∣dom, and discovered the most hidden machinations of trea∣son. The Naked Sword could pierce armour deemed im∣penetrable,

And he who was wounded with it could never be healed, unless its possessor could be entreated to stroke the wound with its edge.

<P>I have mentioned, in another place, the favorite philoso∣phical studies of the Arabians <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Diss. i. ii.</NOTE>. In this poem the nature of those studies is displayed, and their operations exemplified: and this consideration, added to the circumstances of Tar∣tary being the scene of action, and Arabia the country from which these extraordinary presents are brought, induces me to believe this story to be one of the many fables which the Arabians imported into Europe. At least it is formed on their principles. Their sciences were tinctured with the warmth of their imaginations; and consisted in wonderful discoveries and mysterious inventions.</P>
<P>This idea of a horse of brass took it's rise from their chemical knowledge and experiments in metals. The trea∣tise of Jeber a famous Arab chemist of the middle ages, called LAPIS PHILOSOPHORUM, contains many curious and useful processes concerning the nature of metals, their fusion, purification, and malleability, which still maintain a place in modern systems of that science <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Arabians call chemistry, as treat∣ing of minerals and metals, SIMIA. From SIM, a word signifying the veins of gold and silver in the mines. Herbelot, Bibl. Orient. p. 810. b. Hither, among many other things, we might refer Merlin's two dragons of gold finished with most exqui∣site workmanship, in Geoffrey of Monmouth, l. viii. c. 17. See also ibid. vii. c. 3. Where Merlin prophesies that a brazen man on a brazen horse shall guard the gates of London.</NOTE>. The poets of romance,

We are told by William of Malmesbury, that Pope Sylvester the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd, a profound mathematician who lived in the eleventh century, made a brazen head, which would speak when spoken to, and oracularly resolved many difficult questions <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Gest.

Albertus Magnus, who was also a profound adept in those sciences which were taught by the Arabian schools, is said to have framed a man of brass; which not only answered questions readily and truly, but was so loquacious, that Thomas Aquinas while a pupil of Albertus Magnus, afterwards a seraphic doctor, knocked it in pieces as the disturber of his abstruse speculations. This was about the year 1240 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Delrio, Disquis. Magic. lib. i. cap. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>. Much in the same manner, the notion of our knight's horse being moved by means of a con∣cealed engine, corresponds with their pretences of producing preternatural effects, and their love of surprising by geome∣trical powers. Exactly in this notion, Rocail, a giant in fome of the Arabian romances, is said to have built a palace, together with his own sepulchre, of most magnificent architecture,
<PB N="402" REF="569"/>
and with singular artifice: in both of these he placed a great number of gigantic statues, or images, figured of different metals by talismanic skill, which, in consequence of some occult machinery, performed actions of real life, and looked like living men <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lot, Bibl. Orient. V. ROCAIL. p. 717. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. We must add, that astronomy, which the Arabian philosophers studied with a singular en∣thusiasm, had no small share in the composition of this mira∣culous steed. For, says the poet,</P>
<Q><L>He that it wrought couth many a gin,</L>
<L>He waitid many a constellation</L>
<L>Ere he had don this operation <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">v. 149. I do not precisely under∣stand the line immediately following.

Sele, i. e. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al,</HI> may mean a talismanic sigil used in astrology. Or the Hermetic seal used in chemistry. Or, connected with <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,</HI> may signify contracts made with spirits in chemical operations. But all these belong to the Arabian philosophy, and are alike to our purpose. In the Ara∣bian books now extant, are the alphabets out of which they formed Talismans to draw down spirits or angels. The Arabian work KIMIA, not only signifies chemistry, but a magical and superstitious science, by which they bound spirits to their will and drew from them the information required. See Herbelot, Dict. Orient. p. 810. 1005. The curious and more inquisitive reader may consult Cornelius Agrippa, De Vanit. Scient. cap. xliv. xlv. xlvi.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>Thus the buckler of the Arabian giant Ben Gian, as fa∣mous among the orientals as that of Achilles among the Greeks, was fabricated by the powers of astronomy <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Many mysteries were concealed in the composition of this shield.

<P>Natural magic, improperly so called, was likewise a favorite pursuit of the Arabians, by which they imposed false appear∣ances on the spectator. This was blended with their astrology. Our author's FRANK<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>LEIN'S TALE is entirely founded on the miracles of this art.</P>

This art, with others of the experimental kind, the philosophers of those times were fond of adapting to the purposes of thaumaturgy; and there is much occult and chimerical speculation in the discoveries which Bacon affects to have made from optical experi∣ments.

They pretend that some years before the Spaniards entered Mexico, the inha∣bitants caught a monstrous fowl, of unusual magnitude and shape, on the lake of Mexico. In the crown of the head of this wonderful bird, there was a mirrour or plate of glass, in which the Mexicans saw their future invaders the Spa∣niards, and all the disasters which afterwards happened to their kingdom. These superstitions remained, even in the doctrines of philosophers, long after the darker ages. Cor∣nelius Agrippa, a learned physician of Cologne, about the year 1520, author of a famous book on the Vanity of the Sciences, mentions a species of mirrour which exhibited the form of persons absent, at command <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">It is diverting in this book to observe the infancy of experimental philosophy, and their want of knowing how to use or apply the mechanical arts which they were even actually possessed of.

Nearly allied to this, was the infatuation of <HI>seeing things</HI> in a beryl, which was very popular in the reign of James the first, and is alluded to by Shakespeare. The Arabians were also famous for other machineries of glass, in which their chemistry was more immediately concerned. The philosophers of their school invented a story of a magical steel-glass, placed by Ptolemy on the summit of a lofty pillar near the city of Alexandria, for burning ships at a distance.

Ptolemy, who seems to have been confounded with Ptolemy the Egyptian astrologer and geographer, was famous among the eastern writers and their followers for his skill in operations of glass.

But to understand the language of birds, was peculiarly one of the boasted sciences of the Arabians; who pretend that many of their country∣men have been skilled in the knowledge of the language of birds, ever since the time of king Solomon. Their writers relate, that Balkis the queen of Sheba, or Saba, had a bird called <HI>Hudhud,</HI> that is, a lapwing, which she dispatched to king Solomon on various occasions; and that this trusty bird was the messenger of their amours. We are told, that Solomon having been secretly informed by this winged confident, that Balkis intended to honour him with a grand embassy, enclosed a spacious square with a wall of gold and silver bricks, in which he ranged his numerous troops and attend∣ants in order to receive the embassadors, who were astonished at the suddenness of these splendid and unexpected prepara∣tions <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Herbelot, Dict.

<P>The CLERKE OF OXENFORDES TALE, or the story of Pa∣tient Grisilde, is the next of Chaucer's Tales in the serious style which deserves mention. The Clerke declares in his Prologue, that he learned this tale of Petrarch at Padua.

But it was the invention of Boccacio, and is the last in his DECAMERON <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Giorn. x. Nov. 10.

Petrarch, although most intimately connected with Boccacio for near thirty years, never had seen the Deca∣meron till just before his death. It accidentally fell into his hands, while he resided at Arque between Venice and Padua, in the year one thousand three hundred and seventy-four. The tale of Grisilde struck him the most of any: so much, that he got it by heart to relate it to his friends at Padua. Finding that it was the most popular of all Boccacio's tales, for the benefit of those who did not understand Italian, and to spread its circulation, he translated it into Latin with some alterations. Petrarch relates this in a letter to Boccacio: and adds, that on shewing the translation to one of his Paduan friends, the latter, touched with the tenderness of the story, burst into such frequent and violent fits of tears, that he could not read to the end. In the same letter he says, that a Veronese having heard of the Paduan's exquisiteness of feeling on this occasion, resolved to try the experiment. He read the whole aloud from the beginning to the end, without the least change of voice or countenance; but on returning the book to Petrarch, confessed that it was an af∣fecting story: <Q REND="inline">"I should have wept, added he, like the Pa∣duan, had I thought the story true. But the whole is a manifest fiction. There never was, nor ever will be, such a wife as Grisilde <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vie de Petrarch, iii. 797.</NOTE>."</Q> Chaucer, as our Clerke's declara∣tion in the Prologue seems to imply, received this tale from Petrarch, and not from Boccacio: and I am inclined to think, that he did not take it from Petrarch's Latin trans∣lation, but that he was one of those friends to whom Pe∣trarch used to relate it at Padua. This too seems sufficiently pointed out in the words of the Prologue.</P>

<P>Our author's JANUARY and MAY, or the MARCHAUNT'S TALE, seems to be an old Lombard story. But many pas∣sages in it are evidently taken from the POLYCRATICON of John of Salisbury. <HI>De molestiis et oneribus conjugiorum secundum Hieronymum et alios philosophos. Et de pernicie libidinis. Et de mulieris Ephesinae et similium fide</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">L. viii. c. 11. fol. 193. b. edit. 1513.</NOTE>. And by the way, about forty verses belonging to this argument are translated from the same chapter of the POLYCRATICON, in the WIFE OF BATH'S Prologue <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mention is made in this Prologue of St. Jerom and Theophrast, on that subject, v. 671. 674. The author of the Polycraticon quotes Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophrastus from Jerom, viz. <Q REND="inline">"Fer∣tur auctore <HI>Hieronimo</HI> aurcolus <HI>Theophrasti</HI> libellus de non ducenda uxore."</Q> fol. 194. a. Chaucer likewise, on this occasion, cites <HI>Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rie,</HI> v. 671. This is not the favorite historian of the middle ages, Valerius Maxi∣mus. It is book written by Walter Mapes, archdeacon of Oxford, under the assumed name of Valerius, entitled, <HI>Valerius ad Ru∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inum de non ducenda uxore.</HI> This piece is in the Bodleian library with a large Gloss. MSS. Dibg. 166. ii. 147. Mapes per∣haps adopted this name, because one Va∣lerius had written a treatise on the same subject, inserted in St. Jerom's works. Some copies of this Prologue, instead of <Q REND="inline">"Valeric and <HI>Theophrast,"</HI></Q> read <HI>Paraphrast.</HI> If that be the true reading, which I do not believe, Chaucer alludes to the gloss above∣mentioned. <HI>Helowis,</HI> cited just afterwards, is the celebrated Eloisa. Trottula is men∣tioned, v. 677. Among the manuscripts of Merton College in Oxford, is, <Q REND="inline">"Trottula Mulier Salernitana de passionibus mulic∣rum."</Q> There is also extant, <Q REND="inline">"Trottula, seu potius Erotis medici muliebrium li∣ber."</Q> Basil. 1586, 4to. See also Mont∣fauc. Catal. MSS. p. 385. And Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xiii. p. 439.</NOTE>. In the mean time it is not improbable, that this tale might have originally been oriental.

<P>Dryden and Pope have modernised the two last mentioned poems. Dryden the tale of the NONNES PRIEST, and Pope that of JANUARY and MAY: intending perhaps to give pat∣terns of the best of Chaucer's Tales in the comic species. But I am of opinion that the MILLER'S TALE has more true humour than either. Not that I mean to palliate the levity of the story, which was most probably chosen by Chaucer in compliance with the prevailing manners of an unpolished age, and agreeable to ideas of festivity not always the most delicate and refined. Chaucer abounds in liberties of this kind, and this must be his apology. So does Boccacio, and perhaps much more, but from a different cause. The licen∣tiousness of Boccacio's tales, which he composed <HI>per cacciar le malincolia delle femine,</HI> to amuse the ladies, is to be vindicated, at least accounted for, on other principles: it was not so much the consequence of popular incivility, as it was owing to a particular event of the writer's age. Just before Boc∣cacio wrote, the plague at Florence had totally changed the customs and manners of the people. Only a few of the
<PB N="424" REF="591"/>
women had survived this fatal malady; who having lost their husbands, parents, or friends, gradually grew regard∣less of those constraints and customary formalities which before of course influenced their behaviour. For want of female attendants, they were obliged often to take men only into their service: and this circumstance greatly con∣tributed to destroy their habits of delicacy, and gave an opening to various freedoms and indecencies unsuitable to the sex, and frequently productive of very serious conse∣quences. As to the monasteries, it is not surprising that Boccacio should have made them the scenes of his most libertine stories. The plague had thrown open their gates. The monks and nuns wandered abroad, and partaking of the common liberties of life, and the levities of the world, forgot the rigour of their institutions, and the severity of their ecclesiastical characters. At the ceasing of the plague, when the religious were compelled to return to their cloisters, they could not forsake their attachment to these secular in∣dulgences; they continued to practice the same free course of life, and would not submit to the disagreeable and un∣social injunctions of their respective orders. Cotemporary historians give a shocking representation of the unbounded debaucheries of the Florentines on this occasion: and eccle∣siastical writers mention this period as the grand epoch of the relaxation of monastic discipline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boccacio did not escape the censure of the church for these compositions. His con∣version was a point much laboured; and in expiation of his follies, he was almost persuaded to renounce poetry and the heathen authors, and to turn Carthusian. But, to say the truth, Boccacio's life was almost as loose as his writings; till he was in great measure reclaimed by the powerful re∣monstrances of his master Petrarch, who talked much more to the purpose than his confessor. This Boccacio himself acknowledges in the fifth of his eclogues, which like those
<PB N="425" REF="592"/>
of Petrarch are enigmatical and obscure, entitled PHILO∣SOTROPHOS.</P>
<P>But to return to the MILLER'S TALE. The character of the Clerke of Oxford, who studied astrology, a science then in high repute, but under the specious appearance of de∣corum, and the mask of the serious philosopher, carried on intrigues, is painted with these lively circumstances.</P>

<P>In the mean time the scholar, intent on accomplishing his intrigue, locks himself up in his chamber for the space of two days. The carpenter, alarmed at this long seclusion, and supposing that his guest might be sick or dead, tries to gain admittance, but in vain. He peeps through a crevice of the door, and at length discovers the scholar, who is con∣scious that he was seen, in an affected trance of abstracted meditation. On this our carpenter, reflecting on the danger of being wise, and exulting in the security of his own ignorance, exclaims,</P>
<Q><L>A man wott littil what shall him betide!</L>

<P>But the scholar has ample gratification for this ridicule. The carpenter is at length admitted; and the scholar conti∣nuing the farce, gravely acquaints the former that he has been all this while making a most important discovery by means of astrological calculations. He is soon persuaded to believe the prediction: and in the sequel, which cannot be repeated here, this humourous contrivance crowns the scho∣lar's schemes with success, and proves the cause of the car∣penter's disgrace. In this piece the reader observes that the humour of the characters is made subservient to the plot.</P>
<P>I have before hinted, that Chaucer's obscenity is in great measure to be imputed to his age. We are apt to form romantic and exaggerated notions about the moral innocence of our ancestors. Ages of ignorance and simplicity are thought to be ages of purity. The direct contrary, I believe, is the case. Rude periods have that grossness of manners which is not less friendly to virtue than luxury itself. In the middle ages, not only the most flagrant violations of modesty were frequently practised and permitted, but the most infamous vices. Men are less ashamed as they are le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s polished. Great refinement multiplies criminal pleasures, but
<PB N="432" REF="599"/>
at the same time prevents the actual commission of many enormities: at least it preserves public decency, and suppresses public licentiousness.</P>

It was at least evidently written

after the time of Chaucer. It is the work of some tasteless imitator, who has sufficiently disguised his original, by re∣taining none of its spirit. I mention these circumstances, lest it should be thought that this frigid abridgment was the ground-work of Chaucer's poem on the same subject. In the class of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umourous or satirical tales, the SOMPNOUR'S TALE, which exposes the tricks and extortions of the men∣dicant friars, has also distinguished merit. This piece has incidentally been mentioned above with the PLOWMAN'S TALE, and Pierce Plowman.</P>
<P>Genuine humour, the concomitant of true taste, consists in discerning improprieties in books as well as characters. We therefore must remark under this class another tale of Chaucer, which till lately has been looked upon as a grave heroic narrative. I mean the RIME OF SIR THOPAS. Chau∣cer, at a period which almost realised the manners of roman∣tic chivalry, discerned the leading absurdities of the old romances: and in this poem, which may be justly called a prelude to Don Quixote, has burlesqued them with exquisite ridicule. That this was the poet's aim, appears from many passages. But, to put the matter beyond a doubt, take the words of an ingenious critic. <Q REND="inline">"We are to observe, says he, that this was Chaucer's own Tale: and that, when in the progress of it, the good sense of the host is made to break in upon him, and interrupt him, Chaucer approves his disgust, and changing his note, tells the simple instructive Tale of MELIBOEUS, <HI>a moral tale vertuous,</HI> as he terms it; to shew what sort of fictions were most expressive of real life, and most proper to be put into the hands of the people. It is further to be noted, that the <HI>Boke of Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Giant Olyphant, and Chylde Thop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> was not a fiction of
<PB N="434" REF="601"/>
his own, but a story of antique fame, and very cele∣brated in the days of chivalry: so that nothing could better suit the poet's design of discrediting the old ro∣mances, than the choice of this venerable legend for the vehicle of his ridicule upon them <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Hurd's LETTERS ON CHIVALRY AND ROMANCE. Dialogues, &amp;c. iii. 218. edit. 1765.</NOTE>.</Q> But it is to be re∣membered, that Chaucer's design was intended to ridicule the frivolous descriptions, and other tedious impertinencies, so common in the volumes of chivalry with which his age was overwhelmed, not to degrade in general or expose a mode of fabling, whose sublime extravagancies constitute the marvellous graces of his own CAMBUSCAN; a composition which at the same time abundantly demonstrates, that the manners of romance are better calculated to answer the pur∣poses of pure poetry, to captivate the imagination, and to produce surprise, than the fictions of classical antiquity.</P>

<P>BUT Chaucer's vein of humour, although conspicuous in the CANTERBURY TALES, is chiefly displayed in the Characters with which they are introduced. In these his know∣ledge of the world availed him in a peculiar degree, and enabled him to give such an accurate pic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure of antient man∣ners, as no cotemporary nation has transmitted to post<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity. It is here that we view the pursuits and employments, the cus∣toms and diversions, of our ancestors, copied from the life, and represented with equal truth and spirit, by a judge of man∣kind, whose penetration qualified him to discern their foibles or discriminating peculiarities; and by an artist, who un∣derstood that proper selection of circumstances, and those predominant characteristics, which form a finished portrait. We are surprised to find, in so gross and ignorant an age, such talents for satire, and for observation on lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; qualities which usually exert themselves at more civilised periods, when the improved state of society, by subtilising our speculations, and establishing uniform modes of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha∣viour, disposes mankind to study themselves, and renders deviations of conduct, and singularities of character, more immediately and necessarily the obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of censure and ridi∣cule. These curious and valuable remains are specimens of Chaucer's native genius, unassisted and unalloyed. The figures are all British, and bear no suspicious signatures of classical, Italian, or French imitation. The characters of Theophrastus are not so lively, particular, and appropriated. A few traites from this celebrated part of our author, yet too little tasted and understood, may be sufficient to prove and illustrate what is here advanced.</P>

<P>The following anecdotes and obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvations may serve to throw general light on the learning of the authors who com∣pose this curious library. The Aristotelic or Arabian philo∣sophy continued to be communicated from Spain and Africa to the rest of Europe chiesly by means of the Jews: parti∣cularly to France and Italy, which were over-run with Jews about the tenth and eleventh centuries. About these p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riods, not only the courts of the Mahometan princes, but even that of the pope himself, were filled with Jews. Here they principally gained an establishment by the profession of
<PB N="444" REF="611"/>
physic; an art then but imperfectly known and practiced in most parts of Europe. Being well versed in the Arabic tongue, from their commerce with Africa and Egypt, they had studied the Arabic translations of Galen and Hippo∣crates; which had become still more familiar to the great numbers of their brethren who resided in Spain. From this source al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Jews learned philosophy; and Hebrew versions made about this period from the Arabic, of Aristotle and the Greek physicians and mathematicians, are stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extant in some libraries <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Euseb. Renaudot. apud Fabric. Bibl. Gr. xii. 254.</NOTE>. Here was a beneficial effect of the dispersion and vagabond condition of the Jews: I mean the diffusion of knowledge. One of the most eminent of these learned Jews was Moses Maimonides, a physician, philosopher, astrologer, and theologist, educated at Cordoua in Spain under Averroes. He died about the year 1208. Averroes being accused of heretical opinions, was sentenced to <HI>live with the Jews in the street of the Jews</HI> at Cordoua. Some of these learned Jews began to flourish in the Arabian schools in Spain, as early as the beginning of the ninth century. Many of the treatises of Averroes were translated by the Spanish Jews into He∣brew: and the Latin pieces of Averroes now extant were translated into Latin from these Hebrew versions. I have already mentioned the school or university of Cordoua. Leo Africanus speaks of <Q REND="inline">"Platea bibliothecariorum Cordouae."</Q> This, from what follows, appears to be a street of booksel∣lers. It was in the time of Averroes, and about the year 1220.

<P>With these unhallowed and untrue sons of the church is contrasted the PARSOUNE, or parish-priest: in describing whose sanctity, simplicity, sincerity, patience, industry, cou∣rage, and conscientious impartiality, Chaucer shews his good sense and good heart. Dryden imitated this character of the GOOD PARSON, and is said to have applied it to bishop Ken.</P>
<P>The character of the SQUIRE teaches us the education and requisite accomplishments of young gentlemen in the gallant reign of Edward the third.

<P>The poet in some of these lines implies, that after the Christians were driven out of Palestine, the English knights of his days joined the knights of Livonia and Prussia, and attacked the pagans of Lithuania, and its adjacent territories.

<P>Among the rest, the character of the HOSTE, or master of the Tabarde inn where the pilgrims are assembled, is conspi∣cuous. He has much good sense, and discovers great talents for managing and regulating a large company; and to him we are indebted for the happy proposal of obliging every pil∣grim to tell a story during their journey to Canterbury. His interpositions between the tales are very useful and enliven∣ing; and he is something like the chorus on the Grecian stage. He is of great service in encouraging each person to begin his part, in conducting the scheme with spirit, in mak∣ing proper observations on the merit or tendency of the several

stories, in settling disputes which must naturally arise in the course of such an entertainment, and in connecting all the narratives into one continued system. His love of good cheer, experience in marshalling guests, address, authoritative deportment, and facetious disposition, are thus expressively displayed by Chaucer.</P>

<P>Chaucer's scheme of the CANTERBURY TALES was evidently left unfinished. It was intended by our author, that every pilgrim should likewise tell a Tale on their return from Can∣terbury <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Or rather, two on their way thither, and two on their return. Only Chaucer himself tells two tales. The poet says, that there were twenty-nine pilgrims in company: but in the CHARACTERS he describes more. Among the TALES which remain, there are none of the Prioresse's Chaplains, the Haberdasher, Carpynter, Webbe, Dyer, Tapicer, and Hoste. The Chanon Yeman has a TALE, but no CHA∣RACTER. The Plowman's Tale is cer∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inly supposititious. See supr. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. And Obs.

K. 50. Bibl. Bodl. written by John Barcham. But the dis∣cussion of these points properly belongs to an editor of Chaucer.</NOTE>. A poet who lived soon after the CANTERBURY TALES made their appearance, seems to have designed a supplement
<PB N="455" REF="622"/>
to this deficiency, and with this view to have written a Tale called the MARCHAUNT'S SECOND TALE, or the HISTORY OF BERYN. It was first printed by Urry, who supposed it to be Chaucer's <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Urr. Chauc. p. 595.</NOTE>. In the Prologue which is of considerable length, there is some humour and contrivance: in which the author, happily enough, continues to charac∣terise the pilgrims, by imagining what each did, and how each behaved, when they all arrived at Canterbury. After dinner was ordered at their inn, they all proceed to the cathedral. At entering the church one of the monks sprinkles them with holy water. The Knight with the better sort of the company goes in great order to the shrine of Thomas a Beckett. The Miller and his companions run staring about the church: they pretend to blazon the arms painted in the glass windows, and enter into a dispute in heraldry: but the Hoste of the Tabarde reproves them for their improper beha∣viour and impertinent discourse, and directs them to the martyr's shrine. When all had finished their devotions, they return to the inn. In the way thither they purchase toys for which that city was famous, called <HI>Canterbury brochis:</HI> and here much facetiousness passes betwixt the Frere and the Sompnour, in which the latter vows revenge on the former, for telling a Tale so palpably levelled at his profession, and protests he will retaliate on their return by a more severe story. When dinner is ended, the Hoste of the Tabarde thanks all the company in form for their several Tales. The party then separate till supper-time by agreement. The Knight goes to survey the walls and bulwarks of the city, and explains to his son the Squier the nature and strength of them. Mention is here made of great guns. The Wife of Bath is too weary to walk far; she proposes to the Prioresse to divert themselves in the garden, which abounds with herbs proper for making salves. Others wander about the streets. The Pardoner has a low adventure, which ends
<PB N="456" REF="623"/>
much to his disgrace. The next morning they proceed on their return to Southwark: and our genial master of the Tabarde, just as they leave Canterbury, by way of putting the company into good humour, begins a panegyric on the morning and the month of April, some lines of which I shall quote, as a specimen of our author's abilities in poetical description <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">There is a good description of a magical palace, v. 1973—2076.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>On casting lots, it falls to the Marchaunt to tell the first tale, which then follows. I cannot allow that this Prologue and Tale were written by Chaucer. Yet I believe them to be nearly coeval.</P>

<P>IT is not my intention to dedicate a volume to Chaucer, how much soever he may deserve it; nor can it be ex∣pected, that, in a work of this general nature, I should enter into a critical examination of all Chaucer's pieces. Enough has been said to prove, that in elevation, and elegance, in har∣mony and perspicuity of versification, he surpasses his predeces∣sors in an infinite proportion: that his genius was universal, and adapted to themes of unbounded variety: that his merit was not less in painting familiar manners with humour and propriety, than in moving the passions, and in representing the beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and sub∣limity. In a word, that he appeared with all the lustre and dignity of a true poet, in an age which compelled him to struggle with a barbarous language, and a national want of taste; and when to write verses at all, was regarded as a singular qualification. It is true indeed, that he lived at a time when the French and Italians had made considerable advances and improvements in poetry: and although proofs have already been occasionally given of his imitations from these sources, I shall close my account of him with a distinct and comprehensive view of the nature of the poetry which subsisted in France and Italy when he wrote: pointing out in the mean time, how far and in what manner the po∣pular models of those nations contributed to form his taste, and influence his genius.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the troubadours of Provence, and have observed that they were fond of moral and alle∣gorical fables <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See supr. p. 148.</NOTE>. A taste for this sort of composition they
<PB N="458" REF="625"/>
partly acquired by reading Boethius, and the PSYCHOMACHIA of Prudentius, two favorite classics of the dark ages; and partly from the Saracens their neighbours in Spain, who were great inventors of apologues. The French have a very early metrical romance DE FORTUNE ET DE FELICITE, a translation from Boethius's book DE CONSOLATIONE, by Reynault de Louens a Dominican friar <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Mem.

<P>But the principal subject of their poems, dictated in great measure by the spirit of chivalry, was love: especially among the troubadours of rank and distinction, whose castles being crowded with ladies, presented perpetual scenes of the most splendid gallantry. This passion they spiritualised into various metaphysical refinements, and filled it with abstracted notions of visionary perfection and felicity. Here too they were perhaps influenced by their neighbours the Saracens, whose philosophy chiefly consisted of fantastic abstractions. It is

manifest, however, that nothing can exceed the profound pedantry with which they treated this favorite argument. They defined the essence and characteristics of true love with all the parade of a Scotist in his professorial chair: and bewildered their imaginations in speculative questions con∣cerning the most desperate or the most happy situations of a sincere and sentimental heart <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In the mean time the greatest libertie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and indecencies were practiced and encou∣raged.

Their object was to prove the excess of their love, by shewing with an invin∣cible fortitude and consistency of conduct, with no less ob∣stinacy of opinion, that they could bear extremes of heat and cold. Accordingly the resolute knights and esquires, the dames and damsels, who had the hardiness to embrace this severe institution, dressed themselves during the heat of summer in the thickest mantles lined with the warmest fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In this they demonstrated, according to the antient poets, that love works the most wonderful and extraordinary changes.

It must be remembered, that in the mean time they passed the greater part of the day abroad, in wandering about from castle to castle; insomuch, that many of these devotees, during so desperate a pilgrimage, perished by the inclemency of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the weather, and died martyrs to their profession <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">See D.

<P>The early universality of the French language greatly contributed to facilitate the circulation of the poetry of the troubadours in other countries. The Frankish language was familiar even at Constantinople and its dependent provinces in the eleventh century, and long afterwards. Raymond Mon∣taniero, an historian of Catalonia, who wrote about the year 1300, says, that the French tongue was as well known in the Morea and at Athens as at Paris. <Q REND="inline">"E parlavan axi belle Francis com dins en Paris <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hist.

Petrarch's refined ideas of love are chiefly drawn from those amorous reveries of the Provencials which I have above described; heightened perhaps by the Platonic system, and exaggerated by the subtilising spirit of Italian fancy. Varchi and Pignatelli have written professed treatises on the nature of Petrarch's love. But neither they, nor the rest of the Italians who, to this day, continue to debate a point of so much consequence, consider how powerfully Petrarch must have been influenced to talk of love in so peculiar a strain by studying the poets of Provence. His TRIUMFO DI AMORE has much imagery copied from Anselm Fayditt, one of the most celebrated of these bards. He has likewise many imitations from the works of Arnaud Daniel, who is called the most eloquent of the troubadours <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See p. 117. supr. He lived about 1189. Recherch.

It is a proof of the decay of invention among the French in the beginning of the fourteenth cen∣tury, that about that period they began to translate into prose their old metrical romances: such as the fables of king Arthur, of Charlemagne, of Oddegir the Dane, of Renaud of Montauban, and other illustrious champions, whom their early writers had celebrated in rhyme <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">These translations, in which the ori∣ginals were much enlarged, produced an infinite number of other romances in prose: and the old metrical romances soon became unfashionable and neglec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. The romance of PERCEFORREST, one of the largest of the French romances of chivalry, was writ∣ten in verse about 1220.

Falconet, an ingenious enquirer into the early literature of France, is of opinion, that the most antient romances, such as that of the ROUND TABLE, were first written in Latin prose: it being well known that Turpin's CHARLEMAGNE, as it is now extant, was originally composed in that language. He thinks they were translated into French rhymes, and at last into French prose, <HI>tels que nous les avons aujourduy.</HI> See Hist. Acad. Inscript. vii. 293.

<P>This might have been Froissart's song: at least this is one of his subjects.

Flora is introduced <Q REND="inline">"of these flouris goddesse."</Q> The lady of the leaf invites the lady of the flower to a banquet. Under these symbols is much morality couched. The leaf signifies perseverance and virtue: the flower denotes indolence and pleasure.

<P>But these fancies seem more immediately to have taken their rise from the FLORAL GAMES instituted in France in the year 1324 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mem.

She published an edict, which assembled all the poets of France in artificial arbours dressed with flowers: and he that produced the best poem was re∣warded with a violet of gold. There were likewise inferior prizes of flowers made in silver. In the mean time the con∣querors were crowned with natural chaplets of their own respective flowers. During the ceremony, degrees were also conferred. He who had won a prize three times was created a doctor <HI>en gaye Science,</HI> the name of the poetry of the Pro∣vencial troubadours.

<P><PB N="468" REF="635"/>
The French and Italian poets, whom Chaucer imitates, abound in allegorical personages: and it is remarkable, that the early poets of Greece and Rome were fond of these creations. Homer has given us, STRIFE, CONTENT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ON, FEAR, TERROR, TUMULT, DESIRE, PERSUASION, and BENEVOLENCE. We have in Hesiod, DARKNESS, and many others, if the Shield of Hercules be of his hand. COMUS occurs in the Agamemnon of Eschylus; and in the Promet heus of the same poet, STRENGTH and FORCE are two persons of the drama, and perform the capital parts. The fragments of Ennius indicate, that his poetry consisted much of personi∣fications. He says, that in one of the Carthaginian wars, the gigantic image of SORROW appeared in every place: <Q REND="inline">"Omnibus endo locis ingens apparet imago TRISTITIAS."</Q> Lucretius has drawn the great and terrible figure of SU∣PERSTITION, <Q REND="inline">"Quae caput e coeli regionibus ostende∣bat."</Q> He also mentions, in a beautiful procession of the Seasons, CALOR ARIDUS, HYEMS, and ALGUS. He introduces MEDICINE <HI>muttering with silent fear,</HI> in the midst of the deadly pestilence at Athens. It seems to have escaped the many critics who have written on Milton's noble but romantic alle∣gory of SIN and DEATH, that he took the person of Death from the Alcestis of his favorite tragedian Euripides, where ΘΑΝΑΤΟΣ is a principal agent in the drama. As knowledge and learning encrease, poetry begins to deal less in imagination: and these fantastic beings give way to real manners and living characters.</P>

<P>AN INDEX TO THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY By THOMAS WARTON, B. D. FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD, AND OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES, AND LATE PROFESSOR OF POETRY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Index to WARTON'S HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY, which is here presented to the world, was not originally intended for pub∣lication. The great inconvenience arising from the want of its assistance, must have been severely felt by all who have, in the course of their literary pursuits, had occasion to refer to this noble treasure of poetical knowledge. To obviate the disadvantage, as it related exclusively to himself, the compiler, at a period of leisure, drew out the present Index. The experience of its utility suggested the idea of multiplying the copies, by which it is trusted that a commendable service has been rendered to literature. Though none can with reason think these pages wholly useless, some may not find it needful to their studies to possess them; therefore, it has been thought fit to suffer the impression of them to fall far short of that of the History. It does not exceed one-fourth of the number.</P>
<P>Whether an entire Index of the three volumes together would not have been a plan more desirable than that which has been pursued, is a question not now to be examined. It has been considered, and this is the reply: The HISTORY of ENGLISH POETRY is an un∣finished work. The learned and elegant historian was "gathered to his fathers" almost in the midst of his instructive and entertaining labours. Much yet remains to be done; and as it is the reverse of improbable that some other foot (we <HI>faintly</HI> hope, <HI>"passibus aequis,")</HI> will traverse the ground, which he has left untrodden, it cannot be denied, that with regard to uniformity, a separate table to each volume was the preferable mode to adopt.</P>
<P>If an Index be copious and correct, it possesses the first qualities belonging to the nature of such an undertaking. This merit, as far as human diligence could succeed, the compiler claims, with, in his opinion, the no mean praise of having been useful.</P>
