<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT
From <HI>Daniel De Foe,</HI>
To <HI>Mr. Clark.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT was my fix't Resolution never to foul any Paper, or
take up any Bodys time to Read, or my own, to Write
any thing about the quarrell Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> would fain make
with me; but I am oblidged to speak to it, which shall be
very short; Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> who denys a passage Relating to him∣self
in the History of the Union, would fain Rail and huss me
into a Recantation of the passage in publick, and since he de∣sires
it, he shall have all I can possibly make.</P>
<P>I had once the Honour to meet a Gentleman of Worth, and
a Friend of Mr. <HI>Clarks</HI> upon this affair to whom (Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
present) I said, and to Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> I said at the same time, that
I would Write to my Friends at <HI>Glasgow</HI> from whom I had
my Information, and if they would not stand to it, justify,
own, and upon occasion prove what they had reported of
Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> I would give him any Reasonable Satisfaction,
but if they would he could not expect, I would recant what I
had clear evidence of.</P>
<P>Now being very desirous of giving all Men Satisfaction that
have any Objection to make against me, I accordingly have
Written to my Friends at <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and no doubt should
readily have complyed with Mr. <HI>Clark.</HI> But to my great
misfortune they Unamiously Write me word, that what I
have Written in my History is all true, and they are ready to
give ample Testimony of it in my Vindication when ever I
please, and have sent me the Name of five Gentlemen of that
City, each of them of equall Reputation, Character and Cre∣dite
as Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> himself (no Reflection I hope upon Mr.
<HI>Clark</HI>) who they say, particularly Remember the very words.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2"/>
What to do in this case I cannot tell, and would be glad
Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> would advise me, I have a very great Respect, nay
a Veneration and indeed the utmost regard to the office of a
Minister of the Gospel, and I believe I have shown it upon
several occasions; but I cannot perswade my self to oppose Mr.
<HI>Clark's</HI> single Negative, to five clear Affirmatives: Besides
what if one or more of the five should be Ministers too, will
Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> advise me to take his word and Condemn theirs?
When Truth is brought into such a straight, I cannot but
think I am oblidged to go by the Number and Reputation of
the Witnesses, and there I leave it. If Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> has a mind
to push it any further, for he talked much of going to Law
with me, my Answer is Brief, <HI>The Law is open;</HI> and tho' I
am a great way off, yet if he will inform me, what way he
would have me proceed I'll oblidge him as much as possible in
Answering (tho' at this distance) all the course of Justice de∣mands,
being fully convinc't of the Truth and Impartiality
of my History.</P>
<P>I had last Post a Printed Paper sent me which some Body (I
really know not who) has Write in my Vindication, I cannot
but thank the Author of that Paper for the good will he has
shown to me, and for his concern for Truth which to me ar∣gues
him an honest Man; And had he left out that needless
thing called Praise (which asking his Pardon) the World al∣ways
calls Flattery, and I thank God I do not seek, nor can
upon no Terms accept from any Body, had this been left out
I would have set my hand to the Truth of every thing in that
Paper.</P>
<P>I see but one thing in it requires Explication, <HI>viz.</HI> where
he speaks of my asking Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> pardon, and this I say needs
Explication; not that it is wrong related, but least Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>
or any Body for him should suggest that I had own'd, I had
Injur'd him in the History, and had asked his Pardon—<HI>The
Case is plain,</HI> I did at the Intercession of two Honest Gentle∣men,
and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s Friends, they alledging it would be ve∣ry
prejudicial to him, agree to alter the Sheet as it was first
Printed to leave out his Name, and some Reflections I had
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
made upon his Conduct (I appeal to those Gentlemen, I told them
at first I would not leave out the Matter of Fact) according to
my promise, I caused the sheet to be altered and Re-printed
and gave strict orders to the Printer, that none of the first
should be published, as Mrs. <HI>Anderson</HI> and her Servants, I
doubt not will do me the Justice to own: But by the mistake
of her Servants, and without my knowledge, many of the first
sheets were delivered out, which I resented very much, and
caused the leaf to be torn out of those that came to my know∣ledge,
<HI>even after the binding,</HI> and when I saw Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> I told
him how it was, and tho' it was not my fault; yet I ask't his
Pardon, for it is a mistake.</P>
<P>But the good Gentleman is pleased to forget this civility,
and Reproach me with it, after that acknowledgement as a
wilful Act of mine, which obliges me to tell him, I think my
self acquitted of my Capitulation, and shall in any future Edi∣tion
let Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> see it more plainly.</P>
<P>This I say by way of Explanation, of the Paper which is
published in my Vindication, I am told Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> is mighty
warm to find the Author of that Paper: Indeed were I the
Author, and had witten it in Vindication of another Person, I
would for a Muskin of Wine own it to him at the <HI>Cross</HI> of
<HI>Edinburgh</HI>—The Articles of Personal Characters aforesaid on∣ly
accepted, and I must say in Justice to the Author, and meer
Dictates of Conscience, <HI>that abating,</HI> what I call Flattery (<HI>a
thing I abhor</HI> (and which I wish heartily that Gentleman had
left out—I see nothing in that Paper, but I believe to be very
true, all that is suggested seems just and fairly deduced, and
all that is affirm'd, I dare say can be proved, and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s
Paper is so well Answered by that Gentleman, that I need
add nothing to it.</P>
<P>As for Scurrilous Treatment, and Abusive Language upon
me, in which Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> is pleased to abound, he that loves to
roll himself in his own Mire, let him do it, Railing never
mended an Argument, many a good one has it marr'd, many
a bad one made worse; I thank GOD, I have not been used
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
to it, 'tis neither the Sin of my Education, or Inclination;
Less still is it my Talent, and least of all do I value it, when
it flys at me from another; If it moves any thing in me 'tis
my pity, for I take a Man when he is come to Railing to be
but a few steps off, of distraction—And all Men commiserate
a Lunatick, in short <HI>Passion and ill Language</HI> is below a Gentle∣man,
inconsistent with a Wise Man, remote from a good
Man, the disease of a Learned Man, and above all indecent
and unbecoming a Minister—'Tis a breach of good Manners
a Reproach to Letters, a Scandal to Argument, and a Test of
Human Frailty; on these accounts, I take no notice of all
Mr. <HI>Clark'</HI>s Gall; 'tis throwing Dust against the Wind, and it
all flys back in his own Eyes, let him Rail on.</P>
<P>I cannot think it needful to say any more, if Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> pleases
to Writ Annually, or Monthly, or Daily, he is welcome, I
desire all my Friends, may let him alone, as I shall; when he has
made an end, he will have done—and I am very well con∣tent,
to let him have the last word of Flighting, as he had the
first.</P>
<P>As to the History of the Union—what I have written, <HI>I
have written,</HI> there it stands supported by <HI>Truth,</HI> and sufficient
evidence ready to be produced, when Justice requires it, and
what can any Historian desire more.</P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> thinks the World is to be amused with his <HI>Ne∣gative,</HI>
and with a bare denying the words upon his meer
Reputation, I tell him again, there are Men of equal Repu∣tation
(and since he moves me to it, I do say) of Superiour
Reputation to him, that do affirm he spoke them, and if I
might advise him for his Reputation, it is my Opinion, he had
better let it alone, than stir in this lay still any further, least the
smell of it offend his Neighbours.</P>
