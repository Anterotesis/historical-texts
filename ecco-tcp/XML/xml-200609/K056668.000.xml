CONDUCT
OF THE
ALLIES, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Reception a former Work
of this Kind has met with in the
World, and the little which has
been said against it, as to Mat∣ters
of Fact, must be acknowledged to be
all owing to the Truth, coming with an
irresistible Force upon the Minds of Men,
and which always carries its own Evidence
along with it; when we have met with
the Enemy descanting upon it, we have
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
heard them, even in the midst of a Thou∣sand
Curses, and hard Names, which they
cast upon the Author, yet at every
Pause cry out, <HI>Damn the Circumstance,</HI> I
doubt there is too much Truth in it, tho'
I hate the Design of making it Publick.
This makes it clear, which has often,
and upon many other Occasions, been
said, that our late People had a kind of
Popery in their Politicks, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that much
of their Success consisted in keeping the
People Blind and Ignorant in the Main
and most Essential Points of their Affairs,
and which it was most necessary for them
to know; that they were so far from know∣ing
what Usage they had received Abroad
from their Allies, that when they came to
be a little rightly inform'd, they could
not Frame Idea's of so much Knavery in
their Heads, or think it possible that any
People, who called themselves Allies, could
at the same time carry themselves in such a
Manner, to those for whom they had
made the least Professions of any Respect,
or for whose common Safety they had the
least Concern.</P>
<P>As the Truth of what has been thus spo∣ken,
is hereby acknowledged and con∣fest
by the Enemy, which is the best
kind of Evidence; so the Seasonableness
of making that Truth Publick in the Man∣ner
it hath been by the former Tract, and
as it shall or may be in this, is justified
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
and clear'd beyond all Possibility of Ob∣jection,
by the late Publick Resolutions of
the Honourable House of Commons, where
it comes into the World with the Sanction
and Authority of the great Representative of
the Nation; it is true, the Particulars in
the Votes amount to a most excessive
Height; and tho' it was known and be∣lieved
by many to be very great, yet I
must confess few imagined them to be so
surprizing, the Account so large, and the
Particulars so many, as they appear to
be; also one Thing is obtain'd by this Re∣port
of the House of Commons, which
the Credit of a single Author was by no
Means sufficient for, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
had any Share in the Deficiency, and in
the Injuries which this Nation has suffered
under the Weight of this Confederacy;
many would be brought by the Power
of Reasoning, and the Force of Demon∣strations,
which are Things all People are
not equally furnished to resist; they would,
I say, be brought to confess, that there
might have been Defects in general, and
that those Defects appeared in the Affairs of
the Empire, the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and such like,
any Thing but the <HI>Dutch</HI>; but such an
Ascendant had the Influence of the Poli∣ticks,
and the Confederacy of the late Ad∣ministration
with the Parties concern'd, ob∣tain'd
over the People, that tho' any thing
would go down with them against other
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
People, yet if the Dear <HI>Dutch</HI> came into
the Dispute, nothing could be born with,
but all the rest was the pure Effect of Ja∣cobitism,
and the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>How fatal this has been to us I may
hereafter have Leisure to examine, and
every Day is like to discover more and
more of it to us; indeed Things were
mounted to such a violent Prepossession up∣on
us in Favour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that we began
to think even our own Constitution stood in
need of further Security from them,
and politickly brought the <HI>Dutch</HI> into our
National Concerns; thus making ourselves
beholden to them for a Guarantee,
or Safety to the Succession of <HI>Hannover,</HI>
that this might be a Handle to our doing
other Things for them, so exorbitant in
their own Nature, as that no Nation, but
such as depended upon them for something
very weighty and significant, would
ever consent to, or could upon any
other Pretence be perswaded into; yet this
was not all, for when we had brought our
People to stoop to so mean a Thought, as
that our Succession, Ratified by both King∣doms,
and Incorporated by both the Par∣liaments
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the late
Solemn Treaty of Union, could receive any
Addition of Strength from Abroad, more
than that of the Interest and Alliance of so
powerful a Prince, as his Electoral High∣ness
of <HI>Hannover,</HI> and his Allies; that we
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
stood in Need of that incoherent Article
of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Guarantee; when I say we had
stoop'd so low, as to level our Constitution
to the Common Notion of Leagues and
Treaties between other and differing Nati∣ons,
and that it should receive a farther
Sanction thereby, it was not hard then
to fill the Heads of the poor People with a
Belief, that whoever made the least Obje∣ction
against any Thing hereafter, which
either the <HI>Dutch</HI> might do by us, or which
we might do by them, acted therein against
the Protestant Succession: This was a Point
so well gain'd by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that on the
Faith of a Man, if they gain'd it for no∣thing,
it was the best Bargain they made
during the whole War; and if our late
Managers granted it so also, they must
either have given up their Sences to the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> or had most despicable Thoughts of
the Strength of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of our be∣ing
able to support our own Settlement; or
which I speak most unwillingly, there must
have been some private Bargain driven,
of which I shall venture to say no more,
but that I hope no <HI>Englishman</HI> could be
found that would be guilty of it.</P>
<P>To wave therefore a Reflection so un∣welcome,
let us go back to the Observation
before, <HI>viz.</HI> this Threefold End we have
seen it answer to the <HI>Dutch</HI>; what End it
will ever answer to us remains a Mystery,
and will in all Probability remain so for
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
many Years to come, if not for ever; the
Ends which I say it answered for the <HI>Dutch</HI>
were Three.</P>
<P>1. The Barrier Treaty, which with the
separate Article, was join'd as the Advance
Money of a Loan, by Way of what our
People call Prompt-Payment, and which
the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the Confidence to Paum up∣on
us as a small Matter, and a Thing due to
them for the great Kindness done for
us by them, in taking upon them to se∣cure
our Succession. I am not ignorant of
that weak and foolish Use which the Enemies
of Peace made of that Objection spoken
of in the other foremention'd Tract, p. 21.
<HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"That it may not be right in Point
of Policy, or good Sense, that a Foreign
Power should be call'd in to confirm our
Succession, by Way of Guarantee, but
only to acknoledge it; otherwise we
put it out of the Power of our own Le∣gislature
to change our Succession with∣out
the Consent of that Prince or State
who is Guarantee. However, our Po∣sterity
may hereafter, by the Tyranny
and Oppression of any succeeding Prin∣ces,
be reduced to the Fatal Necessity of
breaking in upon the Excellent and Hap∣py
Settlement now in Force."</Q></P>
<P>This by all Means they will have as an
Aim taken for the Pretender, as if, be∣cause
we ought not to put it out of the
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Power of our Legislature to limit the Suc∣cession,
whatever Necessity may happen;
even when this Race may be all in their
Graves; that therefore we have an imme∣diate
Alteration of the Succession in our
View; these People who contend thus,
forget the mighty Noise we have had from
them about <HI>Parliamentary Limitations,</HI> a
Word the Whigs have made so Sacred, that
it has been like the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of their
Liberties, and with which they run down
the Hereditary Right of their Princes, as if
there had been nothing at all in it but Ty∣ranny,
and Arbitrary Government, till at
Length it was happily discovered, that
they were very well consistent together;
and that they who best understood He∣reditary
Right, had proved it to be agree∣able
to Parliamentary Limitation, and then
all was well again. But after all this Bu∣stle,
was it to be imagined that the same
People could so easily give up the Parlia∣ments
Right of limiting the Succession to
a Foreign Nation; and by making a League
of Guarantee for the Succession, legitimate
the Impertinence of Strangers, who may
hereafter intermeddle with our Constitution,
and may tell a <HI>British</HI> Parliament, they have
no Power to alter or meddle with the Set∣tlement
of the Crown, for that it is already
Settled, and they are Guarantees of it?
What has been, may be; and what may be,
may be supposed to be; if then any of
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the Family of <HI>Hannover</HI> should Tyrannize or
Abdicate, or the same, or like Circumstances
should happen, as have happened before,
the Parliament would be disabled from
declaring the Throne vacant, and filling
up the same with such other of the Family
as they find convenient; which according
to all the Whig Principles which we have so
often heard of, is inseparable from the
Constitution, and much more Sacred than
any Thing which has been Hereditary in
the World. I do not encline to concern
these Papers with the popular Disputes
which have troubled the World so much
and so long, about the Difference between
Hereditary and Parliamentary Right; how
far they are the same, or which is best fur∣nished
with Authorities, and Originals,
whether of Divine or Civil Right; it is
enough to take hold here of the Whigs
own Argument, and allowing all they have
said on this Head to be Orthodox, whether
it really be so or no; it must necessarily
follow, that this Parliamentary Right can∣not,
or ought not, to be given out of our
Hinds, and put, by a Treaty, into the Hands
of Foreigners; so that it shall be in their
Power to put their Negative into our next
Limitation of the Crown. If this be not
to give away our Liberties, I would be glad
to know what it is to keep them; if there
be any Choice of Tyrants, and if it weighs
any Thing, when our Priviledges are given
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
up, who is it they should be given up to?
I confess myself more willing to be a Slave
at Home than Abroad, and to be tyran∣niz'd
on by a Prince of our own, than by a
Foreign Nation; and if there were no other
Reason for that than this, it would be suf∣ficient
to justifie the Choice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
there are more Ways to avoid the Mischief
of it, that an oppressing Prince has some
times chang'd his Measures, or he may be
restrain'd, or may die, and thereby a Nation
may be delivered; but such a Convention
as this, made with a Foreign Nation, en∣gages
that whole Nation upon all Occasions
to embark itself, and its whole Strength, in
Defence of the Capitulation agreed on; and
thus by this Method the Power of Parlia∣ment
in future Limitations of the Crown
seems to be effectually given up: How the
Whigs would have liked this Doctrine if it
had come from any one but themselves, may
be best guess'd at by the Warmth they
shewed about the League said to be made
by the late King <HI>James</HI> and the King of
<HI>France</HI>; which put this whole Nation into a
Flame, and Reason good so far as that
League appear'd; for what was it, or what
could we imagine it to be, but a Treaty
of Guarantee with the <HI>French</HI> for the secu∣ring
the Succession of Popery in <HI>England?</HI>
Whereas the Settling the Religion and Li∣berties
of this Nation was the undoubted
Right of the People in Parliament, and so
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
by the same Rule must the Succession of
our Princes be. The Sum of all this is,
that by the Whigs own Arguments, and by
their own Principles, which they have al∣ways
professed, and adher'd to, and by
the same Rule from which they acted in
the Revolution, the accepting a Guarantee,
for the securing the Succession of the Crown
of this Kingdom to any Family, or Branch
of a Family, Race, or Line whatsoever, is
no less than giving up the Privileges of
the People, and divesting the Parliament
of the Power of limiting the Succession to
the Crown.</P>
<P>It may be remember'd, that in the late
Treaty of Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> some Se∣cret
Overtures were made, to have engaged
the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be Guarantees of that Treaty;
and though that Proposal seem'd to come
from such Hands, as gave Reason to be∣lieve
it was rather a Design to destroy,
than secure the said Treaty, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
having at that Time discover'd Willingness
enough to have prevented the Conclusion
of that Treaty, yet those that knew any
Thing of the Resentment expressed at that
Time here against that Proposal, as dis∣honourable
to <HI>England,</HI> and destructive of
the Constitution of both Kingdoms, would
wonder that ever the same Ministry should
so far change their Notions, as to admit
the same Guarantee in so Nice an Affair, as
the Succession to their own Crown, which
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
they rejected with Contempt in a Treaty
with the Neighbouring Nation.</P>
<P>Secondly, Another End answered by this
Treaty of Guarantee, was giving an Oppor∣tunity
to the <HI>Dutch</HI> to play their own Game
with us, with Respect to other Treaties, Quo∣ta's,
Proportions of Payments, Ships, Troops,
and the like; of this so much has been said
already, and is yet like to be said farther in
Publick, that I shall need say the less to it
here, my Design being rather to justifie the
Resentment all honest Men entertain, at the
mean Politicks and Submissions of our Peo∣ple
here, and to show the Necessity of ta∣king
wiser for the future, than to Animate
People against any of our Confederates.
I am as forward as any to agree, that the
Advantages of a strict Union among the
Confederates are very great; and that,
as Her Majesty exprest it, the Interest of
the States of <HI>Holland</HI> be looked upon as our
own; but this by no means hinders us from
desiring that the <HI>Dutch</HI> should use us well,
should shew a Reciprocal Kindness, and
should act with a mutual Concern for the
General Confederated Interest; and that
we should not be willing to see them im∣pose
upon us in any of those Particulars,
or be easie, and submit quietly to it when
they do; and this is so much Justice, that
none can object against; and what is the
best, if not the only Way, to cultivate and
maintain that Friendship, and good Un∣derstanding,
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
on both Sides, which is so
much the Interest of the Confederacy in
General, and of the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves in
Particular. They who contend, that the
enquiring into these Things seems to show
a Disregard to the Confederacy in General,
or to the several Parties concerned in Par∣ticular,
seem to make severer Satyrs upon
the <HI>Dutch</HI> than they are aware of. The
Deficiencies of the Performance they can∣not
deny, the want of a due Regard then
to the Confederacy must certainly lye rather
in those that have been the Cause of those
Deficiencies, than those that have not; for
who are most justly to be charged with
slighting and disregarding the mutual In∣terest
of the Consederacy, they that have
failed in the Performance of the Conditi∣tions,
or they that complain of it, in or∣der
to have them performed? <HI>Britain</HI> has
all along shown, by a Zeal Fatal to herself,
her Willingness to push on the War with
all imaginable Vigour; in order to which,
when Her deficient Allies, having less Con∣cern
for the general Good, have run the
Venture of Miscarriage, to shorten their
Expence; <HI>Britain,</HI> as if the whole Charge
of the War had been her Due to pay, has
zealously supply'd both their Quota's, and
her own: While she was willing to do thus,
her Confederates daily encreas'd their De∣ficiencies,
and her Expence, as they might
very well do, finding her so easie; and
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
while she was willing to sit still, and see
herself, thus used, it was very remarkable
how Augmentations, and Increase of For∣ces,
was every Year proposed by the Con∣federates,
as well in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as in <HI>Spain,</HI>
and none so forward as the Emperor him∣self
to increase the Quota's of the Troops,
and the Charges of the War, upon the
rest of his Confederates; quietly waiting
for their supplying Additional Troops, and
taking Care to have very few of his
own.</P>
<P>While we submitted to all these Things,
the War went quietly on, but whether
so successfully, or no, as it might have
done, if the Allies had answered what we
had Reason to expect from them, is left
for them to Answer. At last, the <HI>British</HI>
Court entering into a more narrow Inspe∣ction
of Things, have not thought fit so
calmly to suffer the Weight of the War to
lye heavier upon one Shoulder than ano∣ther;
and tho' equally willing to bear their
Share of the Burthen, yet not forward
to carry that Load, which ought to lye up∣on
other Shoulders. They are now calling
upon their Confederates, to consider a little
the Justice of their several Treaties, and to
look back, and see what they are obliged
to do, if they expect the War should be
carried on any farther; if they are diffident
of the Success of these Remonstrances from
their Experience, how fruitless the like
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
have been before, and have therefore at
the same Time embrac'd the Occasion that
has offer'd, towards putting an End to the
War, by an Honourable Peace; they will
be justified in it before all the World, both
now, and for ever; when it shall be at the
same Time understood, in what Man∣ner,
and for how many Years, this War
has been carried on; nor can the Artifices
of an Adverse Party among us delude ma∣ny
in their suggesting to the World, that
the Government here is in the Interest of
<HI>France,</HI> since they can have no other Reason
to back that Suggestion, than that they were
not willing to carry on a War upon unequal
Terms, and in a Confederacy with Allies,
who would not perform their own Con∣ditions,
and in which those, who expected
the greatest Advantages from it, paid the
least Part of the Expence towards it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the Third End which this ge∣neral
Complaint against a Peace has been
Calculated to Answer, and which the Party
has taken Care to make as popular as they
can, is a general Notion, that those who
are for a Peace, do it with a Design, by
the Assistance of <HI>France,</HI> to introduce the
Pretender; however weak and inconsistent
such a Consequence may be, nothing is
more certain, than that many innocent, and
well-meaning People, have been prevailed
upon to believe it; and tho' the Impro∣bilities
of the Thing in its own Nature,
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
and the steady Zeal of the Persons who they
charge with it, and who have all along, in
a Course of many Years, testified their Ab∣horrence
of that Interest, and taken such
Steps against it, as have been most effectual
to the cutting off all Hope, both from him
and his Party, might suffice to any reasonable
People; yet this seems to be one of those
Difficulties which can be solved only by
a little Patience and Time: To those who
will be convinced by Argument, it seems
sufficient, that our putting a stop to a War,
which we carried on at so much Disadvan∣tage,
and which had in View rather an
utter Empoverishing the Nation, than a
timely Reducing our Enemies to Reason,
however, was not only necessary on many
other Accounts, but greatly our Advantage
on this Account, in especial Manner; that
thereby we might be left in a Condition to
defend our Constitution, and to preserve
Power to maintain our Succession, as our
Parliament had thought fit to limit it, with∣out
the Help of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and without
being put to so weak, so scandalous, and
so dishonourable a Shift, as to accept of
the Guarantee of Foreign States, to pre∣seve
our own Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>When I look farther into this scandalous
Thing, called a Guarantee for our Succes∣sion,
methinks it represents to me our
People on their Knees to the <HI>Dutch</HI> for the
Mighty Favour of taking us into their High
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and Mighty Protection; and indeed, when
this is compared with the Manner with
which the States of <HI>Holland</HI> carried on the
<HI>Geentruydenbergh</HI> Treay, wherein the ma∣king
a Peace for us was also left wholly to,
or engrossed by, the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the
Thing seems very much of a Peice. The
Barrier Treaty also has much of the same
Manner in it, which being handled at large
by itself, I say no more to here. I have
observed, that at the Time when we be∣gan
to talk here of Peace, and when the
<HI>French</HI> Articles began to appear, we were
mightily amused with the <HI>Dutch</HI> making
Offers, that they would take away the Ex∣cuse
from us of want of Money, or Cre∣dit,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> would advance to us
Four Millions Sterling, to encourage us to
carry on the War. That the <HI>Dutch</HI> made
such an Offer Publickly in Form is known
to be a Mistake; but that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might
be willing to lend, or to give as much as
that amounts to, to have the Sole Direction
of making the Peace, that so their particu∣lar
Interest, which they never forget, might
be principally provided for, this there can
be no great Question of; and the <HI>Dutch</HI>
are not without Cunning enough to make
it so well worth their while, as that such
a Sum of Money should not be ill laid out.
But those People should do well to consi∣der
Two or Three Things which lye hid
in this Notion, of the <HI>Dutch</HI> lending us so
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
much Money, and which by Way of Co∣rollary,
may be of great Use to us, in the
understanding of other Parts of Manage∣ment
on that Side. (1.) That if the States
of <HI>Holland</HI> for the carrying on the War,
could spare us so much Money to encou∣rage
us that we might not make a Peace
without them, tho' that has not yet been
thought of, them however, all they thought
fit to say in former Times, of their being
impoverished, and exhausted, and not in
a Condition to pay their Quota's, must be
a manifest Fraud and Cheat, and must be
with Design to put upon us the Necessity
of carrying it on upon unequal Conditions;
and this they could not have entertained a
Thought of, without first being sensible
that they had us at so much Advantage, as
that they knew, whenever they thought fit
to ease their own Charge, they might-put
the Hardship upon us. (2.) Since it
was obtained by the Arts of their other
Conduct, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had the Sole Di∣rection
of the Peace, it followed then, that
we were under an Obligation to carry on
the War at their bidding; from whence it
was most natural to believe, they were not
dark-sighted enough not to make their other
Advantages. (3.) These Things make it
no longer a Mystery, why the <HI>Dutch</HI> would
advance any Sum of Money for the en∣couraging
us to carry on the War, because
it followed, that we should carry it on
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
under the same Inequalities and Disadvan∣tages
which we did before; but now these
Things are detected, and if we should come
to a Necessity of carrying on the War,
which God forbid, yet that it should be more
than probable we may not only demand
that they begin upon a new Foot, and
make up all their Quota's for the Time to
come, but also may call upon them for what
is past; also it is more than probable, that
they may then plead Poverty with us, as they
did before, and talk no more of the great
Sums they would lend us. (4.) There is yet
another Remark to be made upon this Head,
<HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> advancing such great
Sums of Money to us; we have never found
but these Sums were to be all lent upon
good Parliamentary Security and on the In∣terest
current in <HI>England</HI>; and we might not
be thought ungrateful to the Lenders, if
we asked them, where was the Advantage
of all that? Was it to us, or to themselves?
They must not know the <HI>Dutch</HI> so well as
we have Reason to know them, who ex∣pect
to find them ever forgetful of their
own Interest in any Proposal they may
make. It is true, we have complained of
our being impoverislsed and exhausted, and
not in a Condition to carry on the War, espe∣cially
at the rate which it hath been carried
on at, without great Inconveniencies, and
Involving, Mortgaging, and Anticipating
for us, and our Posterity, at a Rate, which
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
neither are like to see the End of; but what
is our Defect? We do not want Lenders, but
Funds to borrow upon; we have Usurers
enough among us to devour us, we want
no Help from the <HI>Dutch</HI>; we are not with∣out
a Sort of Men among us, who having
little or no Interest in the Freehold, have
amassed infinite Sums of Money in Cash,
with which they Trade upon the rest, and
live upon the Blood and Vitals of the Go∣vernment;
these, like the Eagles where the
Carkass falls, gather together; and if the
Parliament can but find Funds, tho' they
boast of having the Power of Credit in
themselves, and often think of making
themselves Formidable, by threatning the
Government that they will lend no Money,
and that they can ruin the Publick Credit,
by refusing to advance their Money, yet
they can no more forbear, than a Vulture
can forbear his Prey; the Funds are the
Carkass they feed on; they are as Hungry
for them, as a Lion that has been Hunting,
and found no Food; and in spight of their
Faith, often Pledg'd to their Party and
Friends, to run down Credit, and lend no
Money, let but the Ministry find a Fund,
and the Parliament establish a Lottery, or
Subscription, or Loan, and they are ready
to trample one another to Death to get in
their Money. So that after all that hath
been said of the <HI>Dutch</HI> lending us Money,
we see nothing to be said to it, but what
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
was said in Answer to some Bantering Lines
in the Time of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. made upon
the King, which his Majesty by Repartee
answered himself thus.<Q><L>" <HI>Charles</HI> at this Time having no Need,</L>
<L>" Thanks you as much as if he did.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is apparent in our Case we want no
Lenders; we have been devoured with
Harpies already, who think, as no doubt
the <HI>Dutch</HI> would also think, and perhaps
say too, that <HI>the Borrower is Servant to the
Lender.</HI> But we must acknowledge we
want <HI>Funds</HI> to borrow, and where to find
them, such excepted as will plunge us yet
farther and farther into a Gulph, whence no
less than a Hundred Years can redeem us,
is past the Skill of the best Advocates for a
War to find out; indeed I cannot but won∣der,
that in all the Noise the Faction have
made at these Things, they have not de∣scended
to one Argument against the Diffi∣culty
of raising Funds; they have indeed
told us Great Things, <HI>a la Gasconade,</HI> that
there are Funds enough, that <HI>England</HI> is
vastly rich, that there is Money enough,
that we can with Ease carry on the War
this Seven Years, and such Rhodomontade,
that they have Surfeited the People with it
for some Time; but we do not see one of
them that offers any Scheme how, and up∣on
what destructive ruinous Fund, this
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Money may be raised, that the People
may judge whether what is alledged be
true, yea, or no; and whether those Funds
they shall so propose, shall not be as fatal
to the general Good, as those that have
gone before; with such fallacious Ways have
the People been managed, till they have
led them on to the brink of inevitable Ruin;
and now, as if it were not enough, that
the Nation hath for so many Years been
oppressed by the War, through the Negli∣gence
or Knavery of our Consederates,
we are modestly desired to proceed in the
War upon the same Foot. I confess, this
among our own People is a Sign of some
National Stupidity and Blindness, which
one would hardly think possible; but for
our Neighbours, whether the States Gene∣ral,
or others, to desire in, seems to smell
of something we want a Word for in our
Tongue, and may be better express'd in
<HI>French</HI> by <HI>Marveillieux Surprenant,</HI> and the
like. I must needs say I have not yet met
with any Man so weak, but what begins
to feel the Force of this Argument enter in∣to
his Soul, if the Allies have not perform'd
according to their Agreement, they should
be reminded of it; and if we cannot pre∣vail
with them to make up former Defects,
we ought at least to be careful that they
comply punctually for the Time to come.
Can any People be so besotted to a Party,
as to expect or desire that a Nation, already
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
impoverished by the unfair Impositions of
Her Allies, and not able to carry on the
War on the Terms she hath done for some
Time, should not insist upon more Justice
for the future, that she may be able to hold
it out?</P>
<P>Neither is this an unnecessary Argument
at this Time, for if we can carry on this War
at the Expence of Three Millions and Half
Yearly, instead of Seven, then we are bet∣ter
able to go on Two Years upon the Square
with our Allies, than One Year upon the
unequal Foundation we have gone upon all
along; so that to bring our Allies to do us
Justice, and to exert themselves to the utter∣most, in carrying on the War, is the truest
and best Step towards the main Point, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of carrying it on, if we are assured we shall
no more be imposed upon; if we see the
full Quota's of Troops in the Field, the full
Numbers of Ships in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and
all Things in Readiness in Time, and fit for
Action; if any Thing will revive the droop∣ing
Spirits of the Nation it must be this;
it must be that they have some Hopes of not
being cheated again, and that the powerful
Assistance of the Allies will be a Means of
putting a happy and speedy End to the
War, that a safe Peace may follow; and
it is easie to find that nothing but this wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
do it; nothing else can perswade an ex∣hausted
Nation to bleed anew, but some
Assurance that they shall not be suffered by
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
their Allies to bleed to Death, that there
shall be some End of their Sorrows and
Miseries, and that every Hand is fairly
engaged in bringing Things to a happy
End.</P>
<P>But these Things seem to call for no further
Remark from us, they are so natural and
plain in themselves, that every Child in these
Affairs may understand them; for if we must
carry on the War; it must be needful that we
suffer ourselves to be no more abused by our
Allies; if we are not to expect Justice from our
Allies, then we must be unaccountably besot∣ted
if we carry on the War; nay, tho' a
worse Peace were to follow than Her Ma∣jesty
hath good Reason to expect from the
Negotiations now on Foot.</P>
<P>But it may not be amiss to enquire here
what Prospect there appears of these Things,
and what Hopes our Allies do put us in, of
expecting for the future better Treatment;
and that in the Pursuit of the War they
will go on upon a different Foot from that
which they have hitherto gone upon; for if
there was but some Appearance of an A∣mendment
for the future, it might be some
Encouragement to us to think of prosecuting
the ensuing Campaigns with more Comfort;
but instead of this, all we yet see amounts to
little that Way, for at Home all the Fruit
of the Discovery shows only a kind of Re∣gret
that it is made publick, an inward
fretting that the Fact is too obvious, so that
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
they cannot contradict it, and an envious
Warmth at the Justice done their own
Countrey in it, because it touches upon the
States-General, as if to touch them were
fatal to us all; and perhaps it may indeed be
fatal to some Projects the Party had ser on
Foot here, destructive enough to the Liber∣ty
of their Country, and of which a little
Time may give us a farther View: This is
clear, in that all the Reply we have here to
the detecting the hard Usage we have met
with from our Allies, issues in Exclamations
at our exposing the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and falling upon
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> spreading Reports that we de∣sign
to fall out with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that
we are for a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> and a
VVar with the <HI>Dutch</HI>; as if we must refrain
a due Inspection into our own Affairs, for
fear of the Effects it will or may have upon
the <HI>Hollanders</HI>; it is no less the Duty of
every. Faithful Representative to enquire
how other Nations may impose upon the
People, and waste and destroy us, than it is
how we are embezzelled at Home, for every
Breach of Treaty is in this kind a Depredation
upon the People; and it is most reasonable,
that when they have thus discovered the
Fraud, and by who, as well as by what
Means, the Nation is exhausted and worn
out, they should so far expose the Matters of
Fact, and the Persons, that the People may
know by what Means they are impoverished;
this hath been the constant Method and
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
Usage of Parliaments, and the Members of
Parliament could not have discharged the
Trust they have committed to them by
the People they Represent, it they had
omitted it. Nor can this be called exposing
the <HI>Dutch</HI>; they lay open the Truth, if that
exposes the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or any other Persons or
States, the Misfortune is their own to be
liable to such a Charge; but let such People
answer what they would have had the
House of Commons have done, when upon
Enquiry into the State of the War, they
found that we had not been fairly used by
the Confederates; if they had held their
Peace, had they not been Criminally Silent?
Had they not betrayed their Countrey? Had
they not been Accessary to all the Frauds of
the like Kind which should have happen'd
for the Future? And what would the Lan∣guage
of Posterity have been, when they
should have seen that the House of Com∣mons
knew these Things, but took no No∣tice
of them, or any Care to have the Nati∣on
informed of them? Must it not have been
a just Reproach upon them, as it is now up∣on
those who knew it before, and yet took
no. Notice of it, or made any Application to
former Parliaments to have it redressed? But
it is evident these People, who make now
such loud Complaints of the Reflections cast
upon our Allies, appear more concerned that
the Matter is made Publick, than that it is
true; and are so far from desiring any Cure
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
for the Disease, that they spend all their
Heat and Resentment at the Discoveries of
it; and it is to be observed from their Con∣duct,
that they make Ten Reflections upon
the House of Commons, and the Present
Ministry, for the Industry and Pains taken
in finding out how, and by whom, the
Nation has been abused, for One just Remark
upon the Integrity and Zeal in the War of
those Allies, who have used us in such a
Manner: Whence such a Spirit can proceed,
and what Reason can be given for it, is not
so hard to find out, as it is melancholy to
reflect, that so it should be.</P>
<P>I might go forward in this Observation
to expose the Foundation from whence all
this proceeds, and by which we should soon
see for what Uses and Purposes some People
are so desirous of pushing on the War; and
how to do it they care not, upon what
Disadvantages, and unequal Conditions,
they did it; being willing to bear any
part of the Burthen, nay, all the Burthen,
so the beloved War were but to be pursued;
the Enquiry into this will open many Scenes
of private Treachery, not yet brought to
Light, and for that I purpose to do it in a
Tract by itself; I shall leave it to a fit Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>It
falls next in View to Interrogate the
Ministers at <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> how they proceed, and
see thereby what Measures the <HI>Dutch</HI> take
to convince us, that we shall have a better,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
and more equal, Ballance kept up among
us, in case the War is to be continued.
But here you shall find Measures calculated
rather to compel the Queen of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain</HI>
to carry on the War, than to invite
Her Majesty to it by Assurances of perform∣ing
Treaties better than in the Times past.
This is a Temper so different from what
might be expected from a People, who had
so treated their Allies, to us who complain
of being so treated, that it is as before,
<HI>Marvellieux</HI>; or to put it plainer, a kind of
throwing off the Mask; as if we were obli∣ged
to submit to be cheated, after we had
first discovered that it was so; and that what
before was done covertly, and under
the Appearance of a Treaty, was now to
be done more effectually, openly, avowed∣ly,
and in the Teeth of the rest of the
Allies.</P>
<P>This appeared upon the first Conference
after the <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentiaries had deli∣vered
in their Paper of Explanation, as they
called it, on the Proposals of the Peace,
which they had formerly given in. It came
then to the Turn of the Allies to consider
in what manner to deliver in their Answer
to the <HI>French</HI> Proposals; this it was resolved
should be by the Confederate Ministers de∣livering
in their Demands, or the several
Pretensions of their respective Principles,
without taking any Notice of the Project
contain'd in the Paper given in by the Mini∣sters
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
of <HI>France</HI>; it should have been noted
here in the first Place, that after all the
<HI>Dutch</HI> had said, and after all that had been
said to them, in order to come to this Trea∣ty,
prepared to preserve a good Under∣standing
among the Allies, and to bring
the Treaty to the desired Conclusion, <HI>viz.</HI>
a good Peace: The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers ap∣peared
there without any Character, having
neither Powers as Plenipotentiaries, or as
Ambassadors, or any Thing more than
meer Commissioners, Empowered only
to hear what was said, make Report
to their Masters the States, and give back
their Answers, which one of the Queen's
common Messengers may as well do on our
Side. Nor were the Persons, the Equipa∣ges,
or the Sallaries allowed to their said
Commissioners, any more than what was
suitable to common Messengers, whose Bu∣siness
it was to carry a Message, and return
with an Answer; so that in the Conferences,
either General or Particular, there was no
debating Things with them, only just giv∣ing
in what any one had to say, and all the
Answer these Men could give, was that
they would Report it to their High-Migh∣tinesses
the States General, and would bring
their Answer. The <HI>French</HI> Plenipotentia∣ries
presently objected against these Powers,
as not sufficient to admit the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini∣sters
into the Conferences. The <HI>British</HI> Ple∣nipotentiaries,
tho' they were sensible of the
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Affront offered in it to their Royal Mistress,
after such Assurances on Her Majesties Part,
of Her sincere Intention to make the Interest
of all Her Allies to be as Her own, yet wil∣ling
to wave every Thing that might give
an Obstruction to the happy Issue of the
Peace, did not insist on this; though they
could not but complain that it greatly ob∣structed
that happy Concert of Measures,
which they hoped might have been the
constant Fruit of the private Conferences of
the Confederate Ministers, which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
having no Powers that extended any farther
than barely to Hear, and Report, and bring
back a Resolution; was for want of those
Powers quite disappointed; so that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers might as justly be deemed
and termed Porters, as Plenipotentiaries.
Well, notwithstanding all this, the <HI>British</HI>
Plenipotentiaries, willing to promote the
great End for which they assembled, which,
as the Lord Bishop of <HI>Bristol</HI> exprest it,
was in the Name of God, to bring the Wars
to a happy Conclusion, in an Equitable and
Honourable Peace, all these Obstructions
were past over on their Side, and they la∣bour'd
to have the Powers of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mi∣nisters
accepted, as at last they were, with
some Difficulty; and thus they proceed to
the Affair of the Demands, as above, which
were to be delivered in as the 5th of <HI>March.</HI>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers concealing the Resolu∣tion
taken at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to give in no De∣mands,
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
but the very immediate Copy of
the Preliminaries last treated on, insisted that
all the Confederates Demands should be
formed into one Instrument, and be given
in jointly by all the Plenipotentiaries, as the
general Demands of the whole Alliance.
This, tho' something surprizing in itself, yet
was the less so, when it was more known
that this was, in order to execute the Mea∣sures
above noted, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of bringing in the
Preliminaries of <HI>Geertruydenbergh,</HI> as the
Summary Demands of the Allies. But the
<HI>British</HI> Plenipotentiaries taking Notice of it,
insisted, that this seem'd to be destructive
of the Treaty itself, that <HI>France</HI> had Twice
ventured to carry on the War, rather than
agree to those Preliminaries. That they had
been declared Impracticable, and could not
be treated on here; and to insist on the very
literal Form of those Preliminiaries now, and
prescribe the Plenipotentiaries to treat on
them, was to declare against a Treaty at
all. That this Meeting was understood by
all Parties, to be not a Treaty of Prelimina∣ries
in order to a Treaty of Peace, but a Ge∣neral
Treaty of Peace itself, wherein the
Specifick Demands of every Ally were to
be heard, debated, and finally discussed, ad∣justed,
and answered, to their Satisfaction,
which could by no Means be done by Preli∣minary
Articles, which had in them several
References to a farther Treaty, and some
suggested Demands left to be farther discus∣sed
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
at another Time; whereas they were
now met to make a final and general Con∣clusion
of all Demands and Pretensions what∣soever,
that there might be no more Blood
shed in the Christian World, that an
End might be put to the Miseries of <HI>Europe</HI>;
it was also alledged, that the said Prelimina∣ries
had not been concerted with a due Re∣gard
to the Interest of all the Allies; in
especial Manner it was asked, what Article
there was to be found in them which re∣garded
the Interest of Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje∣jesty,
farther than what meerly respected
Her Title to the Crown, and the Banish∣ment
of the Pretender; whereas there seemed
a great deal of Reason for admitting farther
Demands for the Security, and enlarging the
Commerce and Possessions of Her Majesty,
and Her Subjects; for this Reason, as
well as in Behalf of the rest of the Confede∣rates,
the said <HI>British</HI> Plenipotentiaries in∣sisted
upon giving in the Instrument of their
Demands in particular, every Ally by them∣selves.</P>
<P>It
must be something astonishing to such
true Lovers of their Countrey, who can look
back on these Things with unprejudiced
Judgements, to reflect on the Temper reign∣ing
in this Part of <HI>Europe</HI> at the Time of
the Treaty aforesaid, when in all the nume∣rous
Articles adjusted at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and af∣terwards
debated again at <HI>Geertruydenberg</HI> by
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> the former left out
nothing which concerned their own Interest,
Security or Advantage; nay, engaged the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Court to concern and engage themselves
for their particular Security and Advantages,
but not one Word. Clause, Article, or Debate,
was ever thought of for the <HI>English,</HI> either as
to the Security of their Commerce, as it then
stood, or the Encrease of it for the future.
On the other Hand, all the Stress on the
<HI>British</HI> Side, and for which we were to
think ourselves infinitely obliged to the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> was to engage their Assistance to
keep out the Pretender, and secure the Suc∣cession
of the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to his
Electoral Highness of <HI>Hannover</HI>; a Thing
which is so the Universal Resolution of all
the People and Parties in <HI>Britain,</HI> and to
which they think all the Opposition that can
be made from either <HI>French,</HI> or any else, is
so trifling and insignificant, that they cannot
be sensible of the exceeding Obligation on
that Behalf to their Confederates, or of the
great Danger which they were in of
the Pretender, although no Foreign Assi∣stance
had been engaged on that Behalf,
esteeming the Favourers of the Preten∣der
in <HI>Britain,</HI> not withstanding their great
Clamours of a Party among us, to be
so sew, and so inconsiderable, as that there
is nothing to be seared from them; but sup∣posing
there had been more Danger of this
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
Clause, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Succession, then we are
willing to hope there is Ground to appre∣hend
it cannot but be reminded, that it
is as much the Interest of the States-General
to secure that Succession in the Illustrious
House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> as it is even of <HI>Great∣Britain</HI>
itself, and much more than it can
be supposed to be to <HI>Britain</HI> to secure to
them the Barrier of <HI>Flanders</HI>; for should the
Dominions of her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty ever
fall into the Hands of a <HI>Popish</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Inte∣rest,
or into the Hands of a Prince, who is or
may be in the Interest of <HI>France,</HI> the Ter∣ritories
of the States-General being stript of
the Powerful Assistance of the <HI>British</HI> Troops
by Land, and Fleets by Sea, must inevita∣bly
be exposed to the Powerful Invasion of
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>British</HI> Fleets united, and their
Trade in particular eaten up and destroyed,
as was verified by woful Experience to the
said States in the Year 1672, when, if the
<HI>English</HI> Court had not broken off from the
said <HI>French</HI> Alliance, the States-General had
inevitably sunk under the Power of <HI>France,</HI>
and their Government been dissolved and
destroyed; so that upon the whole it is ma∣nifest
there was no need on our Part to
engage the <HI>Dutch</HI> to appear for the Security
of our Succession to the House of <HI>Hannover</HI>;
for that the Sovereign Law of their own
Preservation will always put them under a
Necessity of doing it, the contrary being
most sure to be a great Step in their Injury,
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
if not their evident Destruction: It may be
argued, that in Rules of Government we
are not to depend upon this or that State
being obliged by their own Interest to assist
us, but we are to regard what Necessity,
either for Security of Trade, common Safe∣ty
of Government, or other Political Inte∣terest,
we are in, or may be in, of the As∣sistance
of the Powers we are treating
with, and if that Necessity appears it is a
sufficient Reason for us to secure that Assi∣stance;
and this we have frequent Exam∣ples
of, as of the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves treating
with us in 1676, when notwithstanding it
was the undoubted Interest of <HI>England</HI> not
to let <HI>Holland</HI> upon any Terms whatever fall
into the Hands of <HI>France</HI>; and if ever the
<HI>French</HI> do again make that Attempt, we
ought to assist the <HI>Dutch</HI> with all our Troops
and Power; and that not so much from any
Care and Kindness to them as a Nation, but
for our own Interest and Preservation; yet
the <HI>Dutch</HI> knowing the Eyes of a Nation are
not always open to their own Interest,
thought fit to tie us to assist them in that
Case, and even Articled with us for the
Proportion, <HI>viz.</HI> the Number of Ten Thou∣sand
Men. This is brought for a Reason
why, not withstanding its being so much the
Interest of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> to preserve
the Succession of the House of <HI>Hannover</HI> to
the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> we ought also
to bind them to it by Treaty: But tho' we
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
were to grant all this, it will not follow that
this Treaty should have such a Price put
upon it, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> should demand of
us all they want for this little Equivalent;
and the Reasons above, tho' they should
not be allowed to subsist against the Treaty
of Guarantee itself, will certainly take off
much of that High Price which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have put upon it, as if we were under such
Infinite Obligations to them to secure it for
us, as that we were quite out of Condition
to defend it ourselves, or as if they had
no Concern, or were to receive no Security,
Benefit, or Advantage, at all by it to them∣selves:
Again, it might pass for some Ar∣gument
in this Case, that if any Power in
<HI>Europe</HI> ought to have sought this Guarantee
from the States-General, it should have been
the Elector himself, who on his Part might
probably have some more Occasion to se∣cure
his Passage over to <HI>England,</HI> and the
March of any Troops which his Highness
might find necessary to bring with him, to
assist his Faithful People of <HI>Britain</HI> to place
him on the Throne, in Case a <HI>French</HI> or
<HI>Popish</HI> Interest should make Opposition.
Here indeed the States-General might be
very useful Allies, and his Electoral High∣ness
would have thought very well of such
a Guarantee of the States; but it cannot be
conceived that <HI>Britain</HI> can be under like
Necessity of such a Security: The Succession,
which is their own Act and Deed, being uni∣versally
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
approved by the whole Nation, a
few People excepted, who are contemptible
either for their Number or Interest; so
that on all these Accounts it seems however
a Treaty of Guarantee may be useful enough
for our Succession, and no Harm in it; yet
it cannot be a Thing of that Weight as to
have so great a Value set upon it, and that
<HI>Britain</HI> should suffer herself so much to be
impos'd upon for it, as it is apparent to all
the World she has been on that Account.</P>
<P>We return now to the Manner of the
carrying on of the Treaty of Peace at <HI>Ʋtrecht:</HI>
The <HI>British</HI> Plenipotentiaries having, as I
said above, insisted upon the giving in the
Demands of the Allies in a separate Manner,
have by this Means an Occasion of secu∣ring
for the Subjects of Her Majesty some
other Advantages than by the former Trea∣ty
was thought of; and the People of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
may now see, not only on what Disad∣vantage
for us the former Treaty was nego∣tiated,
when we were to have our Markets
made for us by our <HI>Dutch</HI> Neighbours; but
they may see that all the Noise that hath
been made of the Present Ministry; and of
the present Managers being in the Interest
of <HI>France,</HI> amounts only to this, That
whereas the other gave up all our Interest to
the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the Emperor, these Men are
careful that <HI>Britain</HI> may reap some Advan∣tages
by the Treaty as well as the rest of the
Confederates.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Indeed it has been something wonderful
in the common Discourse of the People on
these Subjects to find the Generality poison∣ed
by these self-denying Notions, <HI>viz.</HI> that
all which can be obtained from <HI>France</HI> must
be given to the Emperor, and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but nothing to the
Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; as if our Strength
were no Acquisition, or our Power any Safe∣ty,
to the Alliance; nay, rather, as if it were
dangerous to the Confederacy to entrust any
Part of that we have fought so long for, and
bought so dear, to the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI>
One would think the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves
went on that Notion, when, as was apparent,
they appeared uneasie and jealous at the
Preparations made by Her Majesty to send a
Fleet and Forces to <HI>Canada</HI>; while not know∣ing
the Design, they apprehended it to be for
the taking Possession of some Place or other
in the <HI>Spanish America,</HI> altho' by the <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>th
Article of the Grand Alliance it was agreed
that Her Majesty might lawfully have done
so if she had thought fit. These Things,
however of no other Consequence, yet
serve to let us see how different, as respecting
us, the Manner of the Allies hath been in all
the Transactions of this War, and how
different their Views have been in all their
Steps towards a Peace, from our constant
Behaviour in the same Heads as they respe∣cted
them; and that in all these Occasions
it has been the constant Maxim of our Con∣federates,
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
that we were to have no Share
in any Thing, but that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> under a
Notion of a Barrier and Security to their
Frontiers, should make large Acquisitions, both
to their Territory and their Commerce, both
which have been consented to from hence;
whether it be to the Honour or to the Infa∣my
of those who have given in to these
Measures is left to the Impartial Part of Man∣kind
to determine: It is evident that at
length the Just Representations of the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI>
Ministers took Place, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> after
much Difficulty have yeilded that the De∣mands
of the Allies be given in to the <HI>French,</HI>
altho' in one and the same Instrument, yet
in separate Heads; and the <HI>British</HI> Plenipo∣tentiaries
agree and propose to add at the
End of every Head this General <HI>and Satisfa∣ction
of all the rest of the Allies,</HI> a Clause suf∣ficient
to remove the Scandal and Reproach
early cast upon the Present Management,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That they designed to make a Separate
Peace, and had actually concluded the Con∣ditions
there of with <HI>France</HI> before the Congress
was to begin; I must crave Pardon if I make
these several Instances of the Usage of Her
Majesty hath met with from Her Allies,
Rank in with their other Conduct relating
to Forces and Quota's, which have already
been made Publick, and all together to come
under the Title of Deficiencies; for if
there had been a more disinterested Con∣junction
of Counsel and Assistance of Mea∣sures
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
in the Proceedings of the Allies, to
and with Her <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, and Her
Ministers, no Question this Treaty had
been with more Ease brought on, with
more Mutual Assistance to, and Confidence
in one another entred into, and perhaps
the Success might have been more promi∣sing
also.</P>
<P>There seems to be no Occasion here of
Entring into the Clauses which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have obtain'd in any of their Treaties and
Agreements with us, by which they have
gain'd Advantages in Commerce, particu∣larly
to our Prejudice, because even the
<HI>Dutch</HI> themselves acknowledge them in
their late Letter to Her Majesty; only de∣claring.
That they do not design to take
the Advantage of those Articles. I am ve∣ry
willing to believe the States-General, es∣pecially
while a good Understanding among
the Allies, and particularly between Them
and Us, is so necessary to them, would not
make Use of the Advantages which were
given them by that Treaty; but this does
by no Means deny, nay, it not Tacitly on∣ly,
but even Explicitly, as it seems to Indif∣ferent
Judgments, grants that such Advan∣tages
are given to the <HI>Dutch</HI> by that Trea∣ty.
See the Declaration of the <HI>Dutch</HI> on
this Head more particularly, as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'For having learnt that the Principal Ex∣ceptions
taken to the said Treaty were,
that it might prove Prejudicial to the
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
Commerce of Her Majesty's Subjects in
the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI>; and that some
had entertain'd an ill-grounded and erro∣neous
Opinion, that the States might de∣sign
to take Advantage by it to make
themselves Masters of the said <HI>Spanish Ne∣therlands,</HI>
their High Mightinesses did
declare postively, and by this Letter do
voluntarily repeat it, that it never was
their Intention, nor ever will be, to make
use of the said Treaty, or of their Garri∣sons
in the Fortified Places of the Country,
to prejudice in any Manner the Com∣merce
of Her Majesty's Subjects; but
that their Opinion is, That whatever re∣lates
to Navigation and Commerce there,
ought to be settled on an intire Equality,
that so Her Majesty's Subjects may not be
charged with higher Duties of Importa∣tion
or Exportation than theirs, to the
end Commerce may be carried on there
by both Nations on an equal Foot.'</Q></P>
<P>Here the States-General acknowledge,
That whatever relates to Navigation and
Commerce in the <HI>Spanish Netherlands</HI>
ought to be settled on an entire Equality:
This is owning what Her Majesty has since
claimed to be Just, and yet that it has not
been so is apparent also; and in the same
Letter they acknowledge it again, by ad∣ding.
<Q REND="inline">'That if there be some Articles of
the said Treaty which without affecting
the Essentials of it, may be thought to
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
want Explanation, Her Majesty shall find
them willing and ready to treat there∣upon,
with all the Facility and Con∣descension
that can reasonable be required
of them.'</Q></P>
<P>Now however Satisfactory such an Offer
is from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who indeed cannot be
suppos'd to be Ignorant of the Justice of Her
Majesty's Demands in this Case, as not to
come to a farther Explanation on these Heads;
yet all this adds to, and confirms, the Com∣plaint
against the Conduct, at least of those
employ'd from hence, who in behalf of
their own Country could pass such a Trea∣ty,
and sign such a Convention, by which
it appears, were not the <HI>Dutch</HI> willing to
explain themselves upon it, there was Ef∣fectually
given up to them both the Sove∣reignty
and the Commerce of the <HI>Spanish
Netherlands,</HI> the last being Exclusive of the
<HI>English.</HI> There is no doubt to me that this
was evident at that Time, and therefore it
is that I cannot place it to the Account of
Ignorance or Inadvertency; for the Duke
of <HI>Marlborough</HI> saw into it, and therefore
how willing soever in other Cases to oblige
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he had not so little Concern for
his own Safety, as not to know a <HI>British</HI>
Parliament would certainly one Time or o∣ther
call a Treaty so Dishonourable and
Prejudicial to <HI>Britain</HI> in question, and there∣fore
no doubt whatever other Reasons his
Grace might have also, he thought fit not
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
to be drawn in to set his Hand to it, but
refus'd to be a Party to it, tho' at that
Time a Plenipotentiary from hence; but
another Hand and other Management ef∣fected
it; and now the <HI>Dutch</HI> are willing to
explain these Things to our Satisfaction,
which would admit of many Remarks as
to the former Part of it, which I omit, be∣cause
Satisfaction will be now obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d:
Only this cannot in Justice to the Present
Ministry and Parliament be omitted, <HI>viz.</HI>
That if this Enquiry into these Things had
not been begun, those Explanations had ne∣ver
been obtain'd, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> had been
left in a Capacity when they thought fit
to exclude the Subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> from all
Trade and Commerce in the <HI>Spanish Ne∣therlands</HI>;
and had been enabled, whenever
their Occasions made it for their Purpose,
to have seiz'd upon the <HI>Spanish Netherlands,</HI>
and have made themselves entire Masters
thereof; so that the preventing these Things
seems wholly owing to the Vigilance of
the Present Ministry, and to the vigorous
Resolutions of the Present Parliament.</P>
<P>There seems indeed one Clause in the
said Letter, which some People are very
forward here to take hold of; insinuating,
That the <HI>Dutch</HI> complain of being trick'd
in <HI>England</HI> into a Consent to a Negotiation
of Peace, by being put in Hopes, that after
they should do so, the other Affair of the
Barrier should be adjusted to their Satisfacti∣on;
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
the Words are these, <Q REND="inline">'That however,
having not long since been inform'd, that
in <HI>England</HI> some were of Opinion, that
the said Treaty in some Articles might be
prejudicial to Her Majesty's Subjects,
the Commissioned M. <HI>Buys,</HI> their Envoy
Extraordinary then going to <HI>England</HI> to
inquire what those Points were that might
be thought Grievances, and authorized
to treat about them with Her Majesty's
Ministers, and to remove, it possible, the
Difficulties by all the Explanations that
should appear necessary; <HI>which they were
put in Hopes would not be very hard to do,
when once they should have consented to con∣cur
with Her Majesty, as they did, to pro∣cure
a Congress for the Negotiation of a Ge∣neral
Peace.</HI> But that the Misfortune
was, that the said M. <HI>Buys,</HI> during his
Residence in <HI>England,</HI> was not able to fi∣nish
that Affair to reciprocal Satisfaction;
and that it having been remitted to the
<HI>Hague,</HI> no Way has hitherto been found
to terminate it there neither; tho' their
High Mightinesses think they have shewn
all the Readiness to comply with any Just
Expedient that could reasonably be expect∣ed
from them.'</Q></P>
<P>This seems to be very ill turn'd by a
Party among ourselves, and implies, as they
pretend, as if the <HI>British</HI> Court had made
Light of the Matter, and promised to adjust
it if the <HI>Dutch</HI> would do <HI>so</HI> and <HI>so</HI>; but
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
that after the <HI>Dutch</HI> had complied and <HI>con∣curr'd
with Her Majesty to procure a Congress
for the Negotiation of a General Peace,</HI> they
could never obtain the promised Condition,
altho they had shewn <Q REND="inline">'all the Readiness to
comply with any just Expedient that
could reasonably be expected from them.'</Q></P>
<P>This is a Black Charge, and had not the
<HI>Dutch</HI> with much more Integrity than these
People, anticipated this Calumny, and gi∣ven
the true Reason for their said Concur∣ring
with Her Majesty, to be their Disposi∣tion
and Persuasion of the Absolute Neces∣sity
there was in the present Conjuncture,
for the Cultivating and <HI>Maintaining a good
Friendship, Perfect Confidence and Ʋnion, be∣tween
their said States and Her Majesty,</HI>
which for the better Authority, I give you
also from their own Letter, <Q REND="inline">'That during
the whole Course of Her Majesty's Glori∣ous
Reign they have had nothing more
at Heart than to cultivate and maintain
with Her a Good Friendship, Perfect Con∣fidence
and Union, and to corroborate
them the most they possibly could; ha∣ving
always judged them absolutely Ne∣cessary,
and especially in the present Con∣juncture.
That they likewise judged they
could not give a better Proof of this their
Disposition and Persuasion, than that
which they lately gave in agreeing to the
Proposition which Her Majesty had cau∣sed
to be made to them, to begin the Ne∣gotiation
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
of a General Peace with the E∣nemy,
and in concurring with Her Maje∣sty
to facilitate the bringing together of
the Ministers of all the High Allies to the
Congress at <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>This effectually Contradicts what as
before is suggested, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were
induced <Q REND="inline">'<HI>to concur with Her Majesty, as
they did, to procure a Congress for the
Negotiation of a General Peace.</HI>'</Q> Upon
their being put in Hopes that it would
not be very hard to do after they had
consented so to concur with Her Maje∣sty;
I say, this is so contradicted by what
is said before, that I was tempted to doubt
both the said Paragraphs could not be in one
and the same Letter; and indeed it seems
shocking to any Reader, that their High
Mightinesses should say in one Part of their
Letter, that they concurr'd with Her Ma∣jesty,
<HI>to give the best Proof of their Disposi∣tion
to cultivate a good Friendship, Perfect
Confidence and Ʋnion with Her Majesty,</HI> and
in another Part of the same Letter to say,
that they concurr'd <Q REND="inline">'<HI>with Her Majesty, as
they did, to procure a Congress for the Nego∣tiation
of a General Peace.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>These Considerations being too hard for
my Understanding, are left to the Logical
Discussion of the Party here, whole Talent
so eminently lyes in Equivocation and Insigni∣ficant

Railery; who when they have chew∣ed
it, and mumbled it, like an Ass upon Thi∣stles,
will bring it out the same thorny crab∣bed
Inconsistency that they found it.</P>
<P>But while we are leaving them to this
difficult Work, it may be needful to look
farther, for we have yet much more Work
cut out from <HI>Holland</HI> than in the foregoing
Piece; the States-General having receiv'd
a new Brush from the <HI>British</HI> Parliament,
are very solicitous to wash their Negro
Skin as clean as they can from the Impu∣tations
which have lain so plainly against
them; but now they find it more difficult
than they did before; for till now they had
only Pamphlets and general Clamours to
answer, such as the Suspicions of the Peo∣ple,
and the Information of a Few had
made loud; and which began to make them
uneasy, these were treated with some Con∣tempt
by the States, and more by their
Friends here.</P>
<P>But the Parliament finding more Truth
in these Things than perhaps they expected,
and much more than the Faction pretend∣ed,
thought it requir'd an Extraordinary
Sanction to make them less disputed, and
thought it Just to make them Publick with an
undisputed authority, that the People ought
to be undeceiv'd, and that the Quarrels a∣bout
the Truth of Fact ought to cease among
the People; for this Reason, having cau∣sed
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
all the Particulars to be exactly and
faithfully laid before them, by the Report
of the Commissioners of the Admiralty,
and other proper Officers, and those Parti∣culars
to be critically examin'd, they dedu∣ced
from thence the Matters of Fact as they
really were, and making all the Cases plain
in which the Government had been impos'd
upon by their Allies, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Defici∣ent
among others; they came to several
Resolves about the same, and drawing those
Resolves up into General Heads, referring
to the Particulars for their Demonstration,
they Humbly represented all in an Address
to Her Majesty, and caused both the said
Resolves and the Address to be Printed, for
the Conviction of all Her Majesty's good
Subjects, and to confute and silence a Par∣ty,
who, as abovesaid, had made it their
Business to ridicule all that had been said of
these Matters as false and empty Notions
infused into Peoples Heads, to raise ill
Blood and create Prejudices against the
<HI>Dutch.</HI> If these Things coming forth with
such an undisputed Authority did a little
surprize the World, and consequently open
the Eyes of the People, much more would
they surprise the States-General, whose In∣terest
it had so long been to have the Peo∣ple
of <HI>Britain</HI> kept as ignorant as possible of
these Matters; and finding it absolutely Ne∣cessary
that something should be said to
puzzle the Cause a little, and to furnish
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
their Friends with Arguments for their De∣fence,
they issue a Paper, Entituled, as fol∣lows.<Q>A Memorial, serving to prove that the States-General
of the Ʋnited <HI>Netherlands</HI> are un∣justly
charged by the Resolutions or Votes of
the House of Commons of the Parliament of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and by the Subsequent Ad∣dress
of the said House of Commons there∣upon
presented to Her Majesty the Queen of
<HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with having been deficient in
divers Respects during the present War, in
furnishing what according to their Quota or
Contingent they stood engaged for, towards
carrying on the said War.</Q></P>
<P>This is the Paper which I come now to
examine, and in which if I should discover
that the States-General have really been so
far from clearing themselves of the Charge
so positively laid upon them in Parliament,
that in every Part they either directly or ta∣citly
acknowledge it, then there will re∣main
little Force in the rest of their Paper.</P>
<P>In considering this New and Great Af∣fair
of the <HI>Dutch Memorial,</HI> it seems ve∣ry
proper to make as few Circumlocutions
as possible, and come directly to the Point.
Our Introduction therefore shall consist ra∣ther
of laying down a List of the Particu∣lars
which we shall leave out, than of what
we shall put into the following Tract; what
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
shall be dropp'd as foreign to the Case in
Hand, and not worth either the Author's
while to Note, or the Readers to be con∣cern'd
about. As First, It shall take up lit∣tle
of our Time to animadvert on the Inso∣lence
Unparallell'd, of a Scandalous Merce∣nary,
who in Defiance of a <HI>British</HI> Parlia∣ment,
and while that Parliament was actu∣ally
sitting, should have the Face to pub∣lish
the Answer or Defence of a Foreign
Nation against his own Country.</P>
<P>If a Man have receiv'd an Affront from
another, and meets one of his Servants,
and says to him, you <HI>Jack,</HI> or you <HI>Thomas,</HI>
pray tell your Master I say he is a Villain
and a Rascal; will not the Servant if he
have any Manners or Sense of his Duty say
to him, <HI>Sir,</HI> let him be what he will, he is
my Master, and it is not fit for me to tell
him so, pray employ Somebody else? On
the other Hand, if the Ignorant. Fellow
should have so little Wit or Manners as to
carry this Message to his Master, would not
the Master say to him, let the Man be what
he will, you are an Unmannerly Rascal for
bringing me such a Message, since you
were my Servant, and not his? And would
he not very justly cane him, and turn him
out of his Service for his Impudence.</P>
<P>This Case, as it is unprecedented, unless
in the same Person who did the like once
before, so it will be doubly unprecedented
in the Publick Justice, if he is uncorrected
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
for it. Nay, by how much more the Par∣ty
glory in and boast of having insulted
the Parliament and the Government in this
Publication, by so much the more Necessi∣ty
they bring upon the said Parliament to
vindicate themselves, and punish the Per∣sons
with their utmost Rigour: But this is
Humbly left and submitted to the Parlia∣ment,
who no doubt will do themselves
and their Defender Justice in this Case.</P>
<P>Next it shall take up no Part of this Dis∣course
to enquire whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> have
ordered these Sheets to be thus published in
<HI>England,</HI> or no. We are not ignorant how
many Ways of Late the Foreign Powers
concern'd in this War have privately en∣deavour'd
to make themselves and their
Actings with Her Majesty Popular here,
appealing at it were from Her Majesty to
her Subjects; but we shall not suppose
however that they are yet arrived to such
a Contempt of their Alliances with Her
<HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, as to appear in an Acti∣on
which derogates so much from the usual
Civilities due from one Ally to another, as
that they should openly and avowedly
make an Attempt of this Nature.</P>
<P>This Leads us to consider how prudent∣ly
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> has acted in
this Case, in which perhaps the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as
subtle a Nation as they are, and how good
soever their Politicks have been in other
Cases, will be put to it, how to behave
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
themselves between the Two Extreams of
Owning or Disowning this Publication of
their <HI>Memorial.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament have first stigmatiz'd
the Paper itself as a <HI>False and Scandalous Li∣bel,</HI>
but in this Censure they do not call it
the <HI>Memorial of the States-General,</HI> but a
<HI>Pretended Memorial:</HI> Now as the Lie is
here given by the whole <HI>British</HI> Nation,
and that most justly also, it remains for the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to show us how they please to take
it; if they own the Paper and the Publica∣tion
of it here, they take the Lie aforesaid
to themselves, and are obliged to fall under
the Charge, hush it up, and thereby own
in Just, or resent it, which we suppose they
will consider of, before they go about it.
On the other Side, if they take upon them
to mention, answer, or vindicate this Pa∣per,
they own not the Paper only, but the
mean Step of Causing it to be published in
<HI>England</HI> in especial Insult to Her Majesty,
and to the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> then sitting,
and what evil Consequences may follow
such a Thing must lye at their Doors. It
is true, that as the Parliament has not
thought fit to take it but as a spurious and
pretended Paper, we might very well do
so also; but as we see it published in all
Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as allow'd in those Prints
in <HI>Holland,</HI> who are said to write <HI>cum Privi∣legio</HI>;
and as it is in these Countries stiled,
<HI>The Answer of the States,</HI> &amp;c. we cannot
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
but treat it as such, or at least as an Answer
<HI>for</HI> the States, if not, <HI>The Answer <HI>of</HI> the
States.</HI> And that this may be justified by
good Evidence, the Reader may observe,
that our Prints after the Resentment of
the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> had made it too
dangerous for our Newsmen to go on
with the Printing it, gave this Account, <HI>A∣pril</HI>
4th.<Q>Hague April 17. All our Publick Prints,
<HI>Published by Authority,</HI> have been
and continue full of the States Reply to
the Resolutions of the Commons of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
in Vindication of their Conduct.</Q></P>
<P>This we cannot but think gives sufficient
Authority to a Writer, whether the States-General
are concern'd in the Publication at
<HI>London</HI> or no, to suppose them to be the
real Authors of the Paper itself, and that
it is really the <HI>States Reply,</HI> as above,
and as such we shall therefore consider it.</P>
<P>The First Thing meet for Observation in
it, is what we ought not by any Means to
pass over, <HI>viz.</HI> That the States-General
confess the Charge, acknowledging the Fact,
directly, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Quota's for Sea Ser∣vice
were not supply'd, or as the Resoluti∣on
of the House of Commons express it,
viz. <HI>That the States-General have been desici∣ent
in their Quota's for Sea Service in Propor∣tion</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
<HI>to the Numbers of Ships provided by Her
Majesty,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this the States in their <HI>Memorial,</HI> after
a very long Introduction, answer Two
Things; First, That the Quota the <HI>British</HI>
Court proposed to fit out, particularly in
the Years 1704 and 1705, were too many,
or more than was needful for the Service;
<HI>viz.</HI> More than was needed to make the
Confederates Superior to the <HI>French</HI> in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and that therefore they the
States did not think themselves obliged to
furnish so many. That whereas we should
have Seventy-four Ships the Year 1704,
and Seventy-nine the Year 1705, they
thought the Rate of Twenty-four Ships of
their State a Proportion against Sixty of
Her Majesty's, and that they concerted it
so with Admiral <HI>Mitchel.</HI> So that it is plain
here from this very <HI>Memorial,</HI> that the
States do no Manner of Way deny the Defi∣ciency
itself, but evade the Force of the
Charge by Disputing the Proportions; and
explaining what they understood by the
Two Fifths to Three Fifths, so insisted on
by the Parliament, and how they ought
to be understood by others. Again, they
would patch up the Deficiency aforesaid,
by bringing in the Number of their Men
of War employ'd in the North Seas to
make up their Quota, and they express this
very Subtilly, as a Thing which they think
ought to be set against the Number of Ships
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
employ'd by the <HI>British</HI> in the Narrow
Seas; this may be consider'd immediately
in their own Terms; but First, it is fit to
Note, that both these Arguments confess
the Charge in Fact, only offer these Expla∣nations
or Extenuations: So that the Truth
of what the Parliament has publish'd in
their Representation and Address stand fast,
is acknowledg'd and confess'd by the States,
and needs no farther Defence. But it comes
next of Course to see what Force this Alle∣gation
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as to their Ships in the
North Seas ought to have in this Argument;
and if it appears that these are not, and
ought not to be reckon'd in the Proportion
above, and that they were not reckon'd in
the First Proportion stated and agreed with
the States-General, then all the Consequen∣ces
drawn from those Proportions will stand
the States in no Stead, as to any Defence to
be made by them against the Charge. In
the Examination of this, we meet with this
Clause in the State of Proportions laid before
the House; by the Lords of the Admiralty,
which stands Diametrically Opposite to
what the States alledge in their <HI>Memorial,</HI>
in these Words, <HI>viz. That by the Treaties
between the Queen of</HI> Great-Britain <HI>and the
States-General, their Proportion of the Ships of
the Line of Battle, to act in Conjunction with
those of this Kingdom in the</HI> Channel, <HI>and in
and about the</HI> Mediterranean, <HI>ought to be Three
to our Five.</HI> The First Observation meet to
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
be made here, is, that the Treaties be∣tween
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the
States, have expresly settled their Respe∣ctive
Proportions, which indeed the <HI>Memo∣rial</HI>
seems to evade, by alledging, that in
the Grand Alliance the Respective Parties
were to assist with <HI>all their Forces</HI>; then
Complimenting <HI>Britain</HI> (I do not say Flat∣tering)
with being more Powerful than the
States, they thence deduce the Reasonable∣ness
of the Forces of one being more than
the other. But the States-General would
think themselves but ill answer'd if this
Way of Argument was made use of with
them, for what is all this to the Equality of
Proportions? Have not the <HI>Dutch</HI> always, as
the <HI>Memorial</HI> acknowledges, treated every
Year with the Queen upon the just Propor∣tions
of every Year's Service? And has not
the Queen sent Admiral <HI>Mitchel</HI> always to
settle that Point? Now the present Question
is not whether Nation is most Powerful, or
whether we are to send more Troops than
the States-General, or more Ships; but
whether the Proportions being settled An∣nually
by Agreement, the States-General
have supply'd the Numbers agreed on by
those Treaties, and sent as many as they a∣greed
to send or no; if they have done this,
then it is true, the First settled Proportions
are of no Weight. On the other Hand, if
they have not the General Treaty of Em∣polying
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
all their Forces, or any other are
Equally of no Force.</P>
<P>Now it is apparent that the States-Gene∣ral
have not supply'd their Quota of Ships
for the Services for which they agreed to sup∣ply
them, and therefore we on our Side justly
Complain, and the Account as it was laid
before the House by the Lords Commissio∣ners
of the Admiralty, and by Her Majesty
Command, is very plain in the Case,
admitting of no Dispute; wherefore we
have for a further and more effectual Con∣vincing
the Advocates for the States-Gene∣ral
in this Case, caused it to be annexed at
large, and is as follows.<Q>By the Lords Commissioners for Executing
the Office of Lord High Admiral of
<HI>Great-Britain, Ireland,</HI> &amp;c. of all Her
Majesty's Plantatious.</Q></P>
<P>HER Majesty's Pleasure having been
signify'd to Us by Mr Secretary <HI>St. John,</HI>
that we should in Pursuance of an
Address from the House of Commons) pre∣pare
an Account of the Quota's of Her Ma∣jesty's
Ships and those of Her Allies during
this present War, and what Agreements and
Conventions have been made for the said
Quota's, and how the same have been ob∣servd,
We do in Obedience to Her Majesty
Command Humbly Report.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60"/>
That by the Treaties between the Queen
of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States-General,
their Proportion of the Line of Battel to act
in Conjunction with those of this Kingdom
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in and about the <HI>Mediter∣ranean,</HI>
ought to be Three to our Five.</P>
<P>That since the Commencement of this
War, not only Sir <HI>David Mitchel</HI> but Sir
<HI>James Wishart</HI> have been appointed by Her
Majesty's Command to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> and
adjust with the States-General or their De∣puties,
the Quota's of their Ships of War
to act in Conjunction with those of Her
Majesty's, as aforesaid, and what was done
in Pursuance of those Treaties was sent to
Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State,
to which we Humbly refer.</P>
<P>And as to the Number of Ships in the
Line of Battle which the States-General
each Year during the War have join<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
to Her Majesty's on the foremention'd Ser∣vices,
the same will appear by the following
Account, which hath been computed with
as much Exactness as the Nature of the
Things will bear, <HI>viz.</HI> In the Year 1702,
Her Majesty had Forty four Ships employ'd
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and <HI>Soundings</HI> of the Line of
Battel, and Thirty in and about the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI>
making in the whole Seventy-four,
and they were join'd with no more
than Thirty-three of the States-General,
whereas they should have been Forty-four.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61"/>
1703, Seventy-nine of Her Majesty's
Ships were employ'd in the aforesaid Ser∣vices,
and but Twenty-two of the States-General,
which should have been Forty∣seven.</P>
<P>1704, There was Seventy-four of the
Queen's Ships and Eighteen <HI>Dutch,</HI> which
should have been Forty-four.</P>
<P>1705, Seventy-nine of Her Majesty's
Ships and Twenty-eight <HI>Dutch,</HI> which
should have been Forty-seven.</P>
<P>1706, There were but Fifteen Ships of
the <HI>Dutch</HI> acted in Conjunction with Seven∣ty-eight
of the Queen's Ships, whereas they
should have been Forty-six.</P>
<P>1707, To Seventy-two of Her Majesty's,
they were no more than Twenty-seven of
the States-General, instead of Forty-three.</P>
<P>1708, The States-General join'd Twenty∣five
Ships of the Line to Sixty-nine of Her
Majesty's, instead of Forty-two.</P>
<P>1709, No more than Eleven Ships of the
States were join'd to Sixty-seven of the
Queen's, instead of Forty-three.</P>
<P>1710, Her Majesty had Sixty-two em∣ploy'd
in the aforesaid Service, and the
States-General appointed no more than
Thirteen to act in Conjunction with them,
instead of Thirty-seven.</P>
<P>1711, There was no more than Twelve
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships instead of Thirty-five appoint∣ed
to act with Fifty-nine of the Queen's
Ships, which as well as those in the Pre∣ceeding
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
Year were employ'd in the <HI>Mediter∣ranean,</HI>
and not so much as one allotted by
the States-General to act in Concert with
those of Her Majesty against the Enemies
Ships at <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and in the <HI>Channel.</HI></P>
<P>Here seemeth a most convincing Proof of
the Matter of Fact. Now let us see what
<HI>Dutch</HI> Cunning will bring them off of this,
for it is a home Charge, and they will not
easily parry the Thrust. The <HI>Memorial</HI> in
Truth does not attempt it, and therefore
the Matter of Fact as I said before stands
granted. But they plead then that we have
not treated them fairly, for say they, <Q REND="inline">'Se∣condly,
It must be observ'd, that in the
aforesaid Account Notice is taken only of
the Ships of this State, which in Conjun∣ction
with those of Her Majesty were em∣ploy'd
in the <HI>Mediterr anean</HI> and the <HI>Chan∣nel,</HI>
and that the North Sea, which this
State, during the War, has generally had
the Care of, is wholly omitted: Which
Mention of those Ships only of this State
which have acted in Conjunction with
those of Her Majesty, and the Omission
of the North Sea, make so great a Dif∣ference
between the Number of Ships
reckoned by the foresaid Account to have
been furnished by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that
said in the same Account to be furnished by
this State, that probably this Difference
gave Occasion to the forming the foresaid
prejudicial Resolution or Vote of the
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
Lower House, which possibly would not
have been formed, might this State have
first been heard upon it.'</Q></P>
<P>This Plea needs no farther Examination
than to look back to the Second Paragraph
of the Admiralty's Report above, where it
is affirm'd, <Q REND="inline">'That by the Treaties between
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States-General,
their Proportion of Ships of the
Line of Battle to act in Conjunction with
those of this Kingdom in the <HI>Channel</HI> and
in about the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> ought to be
Three to our Five.'</Q></P>
<P>It must be surprizing to all that read the
<HI>Memorial</HI> of the States, to hear them insist
with so many Introductory Paragraphs, and
lay so much stress upon their Employing
Ships in the North Seas, when it is thus
proved that the North Seas are quite left
out of the Question, and the Treaties they
had made were only for Ships to be em∣ploy'd
<HI>in the Channel in and about the Medi∣terranean.</HI>
Now if they have furnished their
Quota as agreed upon with us for the <HI>Chan∣nel</HI>
and the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> tho' they had sent
no Ships to the North Seas, we conceive
the Commons had made no Representation;
nor had they any Reason, for there was no
mention of it in the Agreements of Treaties
aforesaid; but if they have not furnished
their Quota's for the <HI>Channel,</HI> altho' they
had sent an Hundred Sail to the North Seas,
it had been nothing to the Case any more
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
than their sending Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> for the
same Reason as above; the North Sea
Guard being not mention'd in the said Trea∣ties
and Annual Agreements. To what Pur∣pose
then is all the long Description of the
Necessity of the sending Ships to the North
Seas? And what can be more surprizing than
to find their High Mightinesses arguing
what <HI>is,</HI> or <HI>was</HI> their Sentiments, against
what <HI>is</HI> and <HI>was</HI> at that very Time <HI>concert∣ed</HI>
and <HI>adjusted</HI> by them, with the Persons
actually sent over by the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
for that Purpose; and which in the
very same Paragraph they acknowledge
was so <HI>concerted</HI> and <HI>adjusted.</HI> For the more
ready assisting the Reader to make a Full
and Free Judgment hereof, the long pretend∣ed
Defence on that Head is here copied out
of the said <HI>Memorial,</HI> and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q REND="inline">'It must be observ'd, That by the Seventh
Article of the Treaty of the Ninth of
<HI>June</HI> 1703, by which that Agreement
was renewed, 'Tis provided, that the
Number of Ships of War to be furnished
by each for their whole Quota according
to the said Agreement, should be regula∣ted
every Year, and that the Rendezvous,
as well as the Places where the Ships
should be employed, should likewise be
agreed upon every Year; accordingly this
has been concerted Yearly, Her Majesty
having to that Purpose for several Years
sent over one of Her Admirals, at which
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
Times Two Things principally were ta∣ken
into Deliberation, namely, the Num∣ber
of Shipping and the Places where they
should be employ'd; upon which the Pro∣jects
on the Part of Her Majesty proposed
commonly the employing a greater Num∣ber
than was proposed by this State, and
also more Regard was had to the <HI>Channel</HI>
than to the North Sea, of which North
Sea not the least Mention is made in the
aforesaid Account of the Lords Commis∣sioners
of the Admiralty, from which O∣mission
it partly comes that they reckon
so low what this State has furnished to
the Sea-service. The Sentiment of this
State upon this Subject has alway been,
that the Number of Ships to be sent Year∣ly
to Sea ought to be regulated according
to the Force which it might reasonably
be judged the Enemy could Yearly bring
into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> the <HI>Channel,</HI> and
the North Sea, so that Men might be
morally sure that the Fleets and Squa∣drons
which on the Part of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>
and this State should act in Conjunction
or Seperately, would be superiour to those
of the Enemy. The Term, in Conjun∣ction
or Separately, was used, because it
was ever the Opinion of this State, that
Her Majesty's Ships, and those of this
State, sent to <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>Medi∣terranean,</HI>
ought to act in Conjunction;
and that the Security of the <HI>Channel</HI> ought
to be left to the Care of Her Majesty,
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
and that of the North Sea to the Care of
this State, because the <HI>Channel</HI> is best si∣tuate
for <HI>Great-Britain</HI> with respect to its
Countries, Harbours, and Commerce, and
the North Sea for this State with respect
to its Countries, Harbours and Com∣merce;
yet so, that if unexpectedly the
Enemy should bring any Fleet or consi∣derable
Squadrons into the <HI>Channel,</HI> or
into the North Sea, then the Squadrons
on both Sides, in Whole or in Part, ac∣cording
to the Circumstances of Affairs,
might join each other.'</Q></P>
<P>It is observed here, the States General
First acknowledge in this Paragraph of
their <HI>Memorial,</HI> That <HI>both the Number of
Ships to be furnish'd by each Party, and the
Places where those Ships should be employ'd,
was concerted Yearly, Her Majesty having to
that Purpose for several Years sent over one
of Her Admirals:</HI> Nay, they repeat it a∣gain,
<HI>viz. At which Times Two Things prin∣cipally
were taken into Deliberation,</HI> viz. <HI>The
Number of Shipping, and the Places where
they should be employ'd.</HI> We can have no
Occasion to make Answer to this in any o∣ther
Manner than by Appeal to the States∣General
themselves, and Enquiring then
whether in the Quota's of Ships at those
Times agreed on, and the Place where they
should be employ'd, any Place but the
<HI>Channel</HI> and in and about the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
was ever included or incerted: If it were,
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
then we must give it against the Represen∣tation
of the House of Commons, and ac∣quit
the States-General: But if not, what
means all the Preamble and Circumlocution
of this long <HI>Memorial?</HI> And to what Pur∣pose
is it said this or that was the Senti∣ments
of the States-General? The Repre∣sentation
and Address of the Commons,
and the Report of the <HI>British</HI> Admiralty,
can say nothing to what was, or was not,
the Sentiments of the States-General. But
to what was their Agreement, and what
was concerted Yearly between the Queen of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the States, that they
may enquire about, and that they do re∣present
Fairly and Faithfully, <HI>viz.</HI> That
the <HI>Dutch</HI> have not furnished the Quota's
which they were obliged by Treaty to do,
for the Service of the Consederates in the
<HI>Channel,</HI> and in or about the <HI>Mediterra∣nean</HI>;
what they did in the North Seas
as being no Part of the said Agreement,
the said Representation has no Ground to
meddle with it, nor does it take the least
Notice of it as is supposed for that Reason.</P>
<P>It may not be foreign to this Case to en∣quire
a little here into the Reason and E∣quity
also of this Argument about the
North S as Service, in doing whereof, if it
shall be found that this Service ought not
to be thought of in Establishing the said
Quota's of Ships, as being wholly and sole∣ly
a Work of Interest, Protecting their own
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
Commerce Fishing, <HI>&amp;c</HI> in which the Allies
have no Concern, and that the <HI>English</HI> had
at the same Time several Squadrons in those
Seas which were never esteemed Part of
the said Quota on the <HI>British</HI> Side, and
therefore that the like ought not to be in∣sisted
on on the Part of the States-Gene∣ral,
then all the Argument drawn from
these Things will fall to the Ground, and
the Impressions which those Resolutions
of the House of Commons have made on
the People must necessarily remain.</P>
<P>It is not question'd at all, nor does it
seem material to this Case, but that in the
several Alliances made between <HI>England</HI>
and the States-General they were Mutual∣ly
oblig'd to assist each other with <HI>all their
Forces.</HI> But this is so far from taking off
the Edge of the Complaint, that it rather
fixes and confirms the same; for that we
alledge that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have not assisted
with all their Forces, and to determine the
Signification of the said Term, and how
the same is to be understood, we are to
observe, that lest it should create here∣after
any Misunderstanding among the Al∣lies,
the several Quota's or Proportions of
the Allies were settled between every the
particular Nations Annually. Now the
Parliament's Complaint is clear in this, nor
does the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the States offer one
Word of Answer to it; they do not com∣plain
in general, that the States have not
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
supply'd their whole Forces, but that they
have not supply'd those several Proporti∣ons
by which their whole Forces were by
vertue of their Subsequent Agreement to be
understood; and this appears from the very
<HI>Memorial</HI> itself, where their High Mighti∣nesses
acknowledge it, and better Proof
cannot be desired. See their own Words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'By the Seventh Article of the Treaty
of the Ninth of <HI>June</HI> 1703, by which
that Agreement was renewed, 'tis pro∣vided,
that the Number of Ships of War
to be furnished by each for their whole
Quota according to the said Agreement
should be regulated every Year, and that
the Rendezvous, as well as the Places
where the Ships should be employed,
should likewise be agreed upon every
Year; accordingly this has been concert∣ed
Yearly, Her Majesty having to that
Purpose for several Years sent over one
of Her Admirals, at which Times Two
Things principally were taken into Deli∣beration,
namely, the Number of Ship∣ping
and the Places where they should
be employ'd.'</Q></P>
<P>Here it is acknowledg'd by the States
that the Quota's were adjusted between us
and them, both as to Number of Ships,
and where to be employ'd. There are but
Two Objections which the <HI>Memorial</HI> pre∣tends
to make after this, the First is, Whe∣ther
the Ships which the States furnished
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
for the Guard of the North Seas should
not be esteemed Part of their Quota, and
Secondly, Whether the Number of Ships
mentioned to be employ'd by Her Majesty
in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
were necessary; these are also their own
Words, to which may be briefly answer'd,
First, That after they had acknowledged,
as above is said, That <HI>the Number of Ships
and Places where the same should be employ'd
were every Year concerted,</HI> it can no more
be asked whether they were necessary; the
Question rather lyes fairly, Whether the
Numbers concerted were respectively sup∣ply'd,
if there had appear'd any subse∣quent
Alteration in the Face of the War.
So that if it had seem'd to the States less ne∣cessary
to send so large a Number of Ships
as was agreed, it must have been reasona∣ble
that a new Concert between the Allies
should have been made, and some mutual
Agreement offer'd for lessening the said
Number on both Sides. But to agree First
that such a Number on both Sides should
be supplied, and then shortning that
Number on their Side, without signifying
to the <HI>British</HI> Court that they thought few∣er
Ships enough, so that the <HI>British</HI> should
be left to send their full Quota as agreed,
and the States only make an Abatement,
this can be no Fair Treatment of the <HI>Bri∣tish,</HI>
nor is it esteemed fair Dealing in our
Country, whatever it may be in <HI>Holland</HI>;
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
therefore the Complaint of the Com∣mons
in this Case seems very just, and is
not at all answer'd by this <HI>Memorial,</HI> for
that the States-General did not supply the
Number of Ships which by their Annual
Agreement was concerted between them
and Her Majesty; Secondly, But say the
States, we did supply a great Squadron in
the North Seas, which ought to be esteem∣ed
a Part of our Proportion, and all the
Reasons given for this Way of acting are,
that such were the Sentiments of the States∣General;
yet in another Part of the said
<HI>Memorial</HI> it is own'd, and in the Report
of the Commissioners of the Admiralty it
is expresly said, those Quota's were settled
only for such Ships as were to act Con∣junctly
or Separately in the <HI>Channel</HI> and the
<HI>Mediterranean.</HI> But because this Argument
is of too much Value to have it depend up∣on
the dubious Construction of Terms, it
may be observ'd, First, That there is no
Parity or Equality in this Argument, for
that the Concert of Proportions of Ships
to be supply'd by us and the States re∣spected
only the particular Seas, in which
the Power of the <HI>French</HI> was particularly
Formidable, and where their main Fleets
were to be expected, as in the <HI>Streights,</HI>
and the <HI>Channel,</HI> or on the Coasts of <HI>Portu∣gal</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI> And that the <HI>British</HI> Nation
have kept great Squadrons and Fleets out
in sundry other Parts of the World, as the
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
<HI>Dutch</HI> have done in the <HI>North Sea,</HI> with∣out
reckoning any such Ships into the
Quota or Proportions of the Fleets to be
furnished as before, for the Carrying on
the War, such have been the Fleets and
Ships constantly sent to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
to <HI>St. Helena,</HI> to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &amp;c. by
which it appears, that whatever the Sen∣timents
of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> have been,
as above, the Sentiments of the <HI>British</HI>
Court have always been, that each Ally
ought to have supply'd their full Quota of
such Ships as were concerted for the Ser∣vice
of the War in the <HI>Channel</HI> and in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> without esteeming such
Ships as Part thereof which they respective∣ly
were obliged to furnish for the Prote∣ction
of their Commerce in any other Part
of the World; and that this was the real
Sentiments of the States-General as well as
of Her Majesty, appears for that in all the
Ships sent by either of the Powers into o∣ther
Parts of the World, as into the North
Seas, the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the <HI>West-Indies, St. He∣lena,</HI>
and the like, they very seldom acted
in Conjunction, but sent their respective
Squadrons separately, as the Necessity of
their Affairs requir'd. Nor did those Ships
act in Conjunction on any Occasion, save
only as they found it necessary to take the
Ships of each other Nation under Convoy,
or in their Protection, and made use of
the Harbours of each Confederate as there
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
might be Occasion. This is manifest, in
that notwithstanding the great Fleets
which the States-General have upon all
Occasions sent to the North Seas, as is al∣ledg'd,
the <HI>British</HI> Court have been oblig'd
also to send Annual Squadrons to those
Seas for the Safety of their Trade, as well
to <HI>Russia</HI> as to the <HI>East-Country,</HI> the <HI>Elbe</HI>
and the <HI>Weser,</HI> as also for the Defence of
the Coast of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI>; which
Ships, tho' equal, if not superiour, to the
Numbers sent into those Seas by the States-General,
have not been accounted by Her
Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty as any Part of the Proportion of
Ships concerted as abovesaid with the
States.</P>
<P>This therefore can never be the Reason
of the Report of the Commissioners of
the Admiralty; and it is surprizing to
all those who know the State of those
Things, to hear the <HI>Memorial</HI> say, the
States General had the Care of the North
Seas, as they do when they sum up that
Part of their Case as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'It must
be observed, that in the aforesaid Ac∣count
Notice is taken only of the Ships
of this State, which in Conjunction with
those of Her Majesty were employed in
the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and the <HI>Channel</HI>; and
that the North Sea, which this State, du∣ring
the War, has generally had the Care
of, is wholly omitted: Which Two
Things, namely, the Mention of those
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
Ships only of this State which have acted
in Conjunction with those of Her Ma∣jesty,
and the Omission of the North
Sea, make so great a Difference be∣tween
the Number of Ships reckoned
by the foresaid Account to have been
furnished by this State, that probably
this Difference gave Occasion to the
forming the foresaid prejudicial Resolu∣tion
or Vote of the Lower House, which
possibly would not have been formed
might this State have first been heard
upon it.'</Q></P>
<P>It should seem Needful here to enter
into an Enquiry what Number of Ships
Her Majesty has from Time to Time sent
into the North Seas, and how the States-General
may be said to have had the Care
of the North Seas, when it is well known
the <HI>British</HI> Trade, nay, and even often the
<HI>Dutch</HI> to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> have been Convoy'd
Out and Home by Her Majesty's Ships;
and the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Mouth of
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the <HI>Elbe,</HI> have been con∣stantly
Guarded by the <HI>British</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>Thus by the plainest Reasoning in the
World the <HI>Memorial</HI> is fallacious, for that
the Desiciencies complain'd of remain
consest by the States themselves, the
Reasons pretended to justify themselves
are directly contrary to the concerted Pro∣portions
and Treaties made between the
said States-General and the Queen's Ma∣jesty;
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
and this is exactly agreeable to
the Report of the Commissioners of the
Admiralty, and the Resolutions of the
House of Commons.</P>
<P>The like fallacious Way of Arguing ap∣pears
in the Case of the Land-Forces or
Troops, in which still their High Migh∣tinesses
do not deny the Matter of Fact
alledged in the said Address, but excuse
and extenuate the same by their Efforts
otherways, as particularly, they alledge
an Article of their Raising Troops before
us, and this they say deserves some Com∣pensation;
<HI>that is,</HI> that they having rai∣sed
Fifty Thousand Men before us, they
should be therefore allowed to maintain
Fewer than they agreed for afterwards;
or to speak plainly, that because they
were obliged to a quicker Armament than
the <HI>British,</HI> therefore they were to have
leave to break in upon future Concert,
and fail in the Numbers they were to
bring in afterward: This seems no un∣fair
Construction of the First Clause of
the <HI>Memorial</HI> relating to the Troops, which
is as follows.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'In the First Place, it must not be
omitted to observe on the said Estimate,
that in the general Charge for the
Year 1701, the Forty-four Thousand
Nine Hundred Ninety-two Men which
the <HI>Ʋnited-Netherlands</HI> kept up after the
Peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> are mixed with the
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
Thirty-four Thousand Eight Hundred
Sixty-six Men which were taken into
Service immediately after the Death of
<HI>Charles</HI> the Second King of <HI>Spain</HI>; and
that for the Year 1702, not only the
Troops which this State took into Ser∣vice
that Year, but those hired the
Beginning of the foregoing Year, are
reckon'd all together; which if put down
more distinctly would have shewn, that
this State had reinforced their I roops
with above Fifty Thousand Men a con∣siderable
Time before <HI>Great-Britain</HI> came
to make any particular Augmentation;
which earlier Arming, to the excessive
Expence of this State, well deserved to
be allowed for by some kind of Com∣pensation.'</Q></P>
<P>What can the Words <HI>deserve some Com∣pensation</HI>
be suppos'd to signify, but that
the States-General concluded from thence
that their future Deficiency was to be al∣low'd
because of their more Arming than
the <HI>English?</HI> Which any one that remem∣bers
the Occasion may find other Rea∣sons
to give for, and which the States-General
themselves seem to acknowledge,
or at least to hint at, which was in short,
that the Parliament and People of <HI>England</HI>
did not come into the Measures for the
last War, or perhaps believe it so ne∣cessary
at first as the States did, and
therefore did not Vote such large Sums
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
for their Proportion as the States-Gene∣ral
requir'd, and this they now alledge
should be made up afterwards. This is
gathered from the following Words in
the <HI>Memorial.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This State were obliged to be con∣tent
with <HI>Great-Britain's</HI> furnishing in
the Beginning of the War no more
than Forty Thousand Men in the <HI>Ne∣therlands,</HI>
in so great a Disproportion
with respect to this State; not because
there was any Convention or Agree∣ment
made about it, or that it was
at all reasonable, but because no more
was consented to by the Parliament,
the Reasons of which are probable fresh
still in the Remembrance of many;
and at that Time the only Course
this State could take, was to burthen
itself with so great a Disproportion,
and to wait till in the Continuance of
the War it should be made good to
them'</Q></P>
<P>This may imply that the States-Gene∣ral
desired to have this Disproportion
made good to them afterwards by the
<HI>English,</HI> but does not prove that it
ought to have been made good, or that
the Queen of <HI>Great-Britian</HI> had agreed
to make it good much less did it signifie
that they were thereby Entituled to make
it good to themselves by a Deficiency in
such Quota's and Proportions as they
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
should agree afterwards to bring into the
Field.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then it seems the
Sum of the Case is this, that the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have really been Deficient in the said Quo∣ta's,
but that according to their own Senti∣ments
they might lawfully be so, notwith∣standing
express Treaties and Conventions
to the contrary; and that these Sentiments
arise from their thinking fit to make Repri∣zal
or Stoppage upon <HI>England,</HI> for the
<HI>Dutch</HI> coming into the War a Year before
us; and because we did not think fit to
come into the Alliance sooner, they are
making us pay for our standing out.</P>
<P>More or less than this cannot be made of
their long <HI>Memorial,</HI> and as to the Justice
and Equity of this the World is left to judge
of that Affair.</P>
<P>The Author of this had resolved to add
here some Remarks about the Pretence of
carrying on the War with all their Forces;
and the States saying that <HI>Britain</HI> is more
Powerful, and therefore must bring in more
Forces, making themselves Judges of who
is, or is not, most Powerful; but Her Ma∣jesty's
Answer to the States, since published,
has made this so clear, and prest it so close
upon the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that it seems needless to
say any more to that Point.</P>
