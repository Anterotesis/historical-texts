<P>THE following Scenes were written with
no other View than to serve Mr. <HI>Wood∣ward</HI>
last Year at his Benefit; and to expose a
Set of People, (the <HI>Daffodils</HI>) whom the Au∣thor
thinks more prejudicial to the Community,
than the various Characters of <HI>Bucks, Bloods,</HI>
<HI>Flashes</HI> and <HI>Fribbles,</HI> which have by Turns in∣fested
the Town, and been justly ridicul'd upon
the Stage. He expects no Mercy from the Cri∣tics:
But the more indulgent Public, perhaps,
will excuse his Endeavours to please them, when
they shall know, that the Performance was
plan'd, written, and acted in less than a Month.</P>

<L>WHY to this Farce this Title given,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Seventeen Hundred Fifty Seven?</HI></L>
<L>Is it a Register of Fashions,</L>
<L>Of Follies, Frailties, fav'rite Passions?</L>
<L>Or is't design'd to make appear,</L>
<L>How happy, good, and wise you were,</L>
<L>In this same <HI>memorable</HI> Year?</L>
<L>Sure with our Author Wit was scarce,</L>
<L>To croud so many Virtues in a Farce.</L>
<L>Perhaps 'tis meant to make you stare,</L>
<L>Like Cloths hung out at Country Fair;</L>
<L>On which strange Monsters glare and grin,</L>
<L>To draw the gaping Bumpkins in.—</L>
<L>Tho' 'tis the Genius of the Age,</L>
<L>To catch the Eye with Title-Page;</L>
<L>Yet here we dare not so abuse ye—</L>
<L>We have some Monsters to amuse ye.</L>

<L>Ye Slaves to Fashion, Dupes of Chance;</L>
<L>Whom Fortune leads her fickle Dance:</L>
<L>Who, as the <HI>Dice</HI> shall smile or frown,</L>
<L>Are rich and poor, and up and down;</L>
<L>Whose Minds eternal Vigils keep;</L>
<L>Who—like <HI>Macbeth,</HI> have murder'd Sleep!—</L>
<L>Each modish Vice this Night shall rise,</L>
<L>Like <HI>Banquo</HI>'s Ghost, before your Eyes;</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>
While, conscious you, shall start and roar—</L>
<L><HI>Hence, horrid Farce!—we'll see no more!</HI>—</L>
<L>—Ye Ladies, too—Maids, Widows, Wives—</L>
<L>Now tremble for your naughty Lives!</L>
<L>How will your Hearts go pit-a-pat?—</L>
<L>Bless me!—Lord!—what's the Fellow at?—</L>
<L>Was Poet e'er so rude before?</L>
<L>Why sure the Brute will say no more—</L>
<L>Again!—O Gad!—I cannot bear—</L>
<L>Here—you Boxkeeper,—call my Chair:</L>
<L>Peace, Ladies—'tis a false Alarm—</L>

<L>Th' unnatural Fool has drawn a Plan,</L>
<L>Where Women like a worthless Man,</L>
<L>A Fault ne'er heard of since the World began.</L>
<L>This Year he lets you steal away—</L>

<P>Indeed, my Dear, then it will be the
first Frolic I ever repented in all my
Life. Lookee, <HI>Bell,</HI> 'tis in vain to
oppose me, for I am resolv'd—the only Way to
find out his Character, is to see him thus, and con∣verse
freely with him. If he is the Wretch he is
reported to be, I shall away with him at once;
and if he is not, he will thank me for the Trial, and
our Union will be the stronger.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never knew a Woman yet, who had Prudence
enough to turn off a pretty Fellow, because he had
a little more Wickedness than the rest of his Neigh∣bours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will be the first to set a better Example.
—If I did not think a Man's Character was of some
Consequence, I should not now run such Risques, and
encounter such Difficulties, to be better acquainted
with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, <HI>Sophy!</HI> if you have Love enough to be jea∣lous,
and Jealousy enough to try these Experiments
—don't imagine, tho' you should make terrible
Discoveries, that you can immediately quit your In∣clinations,
with your Breeches; and return so very
philosophically to your Petticoats again, ha, ha!—</P>

<P>You may be as merry with my Weaknesses, as
you please, Madam; but I know my own Heart,

<P>We are great Bullies by Nature; but Courage

<P>That's the Question, my Dear—<HI>Tukely,</HI> I say,
either stung by Jealousy, or unwilling to lose me,
without a Struggle, has intreated me to know more
of his Rival, before I engage too far with him—
Many strange Things he has told me, which have
piqu'd me I must confess, and I am now prepar'd
for the Proof.</P>

<SP>

<P>You'll certainly be discover'd, and put to Shame.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you went to Lady <HI>Fanny</HI>'s last Night, and
left me, as you thought, little dispos'd for a Frolic,
I dress'd me as you see, call'd a Chair, and went to
the <HI>King's-Arms</HI>—ask'd for my Gentleman, and
was shewn into a Room—he immediately left his
Company, and came to me.</P>

with all the Openness imaginable, and wou'd have
introduc'd me to his Friends; I begg'd to be ex∣cus'd,

now ready, as you see, to keep my Word.</P>

<SPEAKER>ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Astonishing!—and what did you talk about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of various Things—Women among the rest; and
tho' I have not absolutely any open Acts of Rebel∣lion
against him, yet, I fear he is a Traytor at Heart
—and then such Vanity!—but I had not Time

to make great Discoveries—It was merely the Pro∣logue—

<P>I met Miss <HI>Sophy</HI> this Moment in a Hackney Chair,
at the End of the Street: I knew her by the Pink
Negligeè; but upon my crossing the Way to speak
to her, she turn'd her Head away, laugh'd violently,

<P>Yes, yes, Madam; I imagine she had some Engage∣ment
upon her Hands—But sure, Madam, her
great Desire to see her more agreeable Friends, need
not be attended with Contempt and Disregard to
the rest of her Acquaintance.</P>

<P>Answer, Miss!—No, Heav'n forbid you should—
for my Part, I have given up all my Hopes as a
Lover, and only, now, feel for her as a Friend—
and indeed as a Friend, a sincere Friend—I can't but
say, that going out in a Hackney Chair, without a
Servant, and endeavouring to conceal herself, is some∣what
incompatible with Miss <HI>Sophy</HI>'s Rank and Re∣putation
—This I speak as a Friend—not as a
Lover, Miss <HI>Bell</HI>—pray mind that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARABELLA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see it very plainly, Mr. <HI>Tukely</HI>—and it gives
me great Pleasure, that you can be so indifferent in
your Love, and yet so jealous in your Friendship.</P>

Vices and Fopperies of every other Nation, to the

this poor Fellow, and my dear Cousin <HI>Sophy?</HI> Little
do they imagine, with all their wise Discoveries, that
<HI>Daffodil</HI> is as faithful a Lover, as he is an accom∣plish'd

when they find that he has artfully pretended a Re∣gard
for them, the better to conceal his real Pas∣sion
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
for me—They will certainly tear my Eyes out;
and what will Cousin <HI>Sophy</HI> say to me, when we are
oblig'd to declare our Passion? No Matter what—
'Tis the Fortune of War—And I shall only serve
her, as she and every other Friend wou'd serve me
