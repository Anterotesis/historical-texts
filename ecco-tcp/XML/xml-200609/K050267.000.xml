<P>A BRIEF CASE OF THE DISTILLERS, And of the Distilling Trade IN
<HI>ENGLAND,</HI> SHEWING How far it is the Interest of 
<HI>England</HI> to encourage the said Trade, as it is so 
considerable an Advantage 

To the Landed Interest,
To the Trade and Navigation,
To the Publick Revenue, and
To the Employment of the Poor.

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS almost every thing in this
criticising Age is liable to be
cavil'd at and disputed, so
contrary to the Rules of
Charity and good Humour, it is the
avow'd Temper, or at least the Practice
of the Age, where any thing so disputed
is liable to a double or differing Con∣struction,
always to take it in the
worst.</P>
<P>To prevent this, and anticipate the
Cavils of those who would suggest E∣vil
where no Evil ought to be suggested,
a short Preface is thought needful to
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
this Work, tho otherwise plain enough,
to prepare the Reader to be at least ho∣nest
and just, if he should not incline to
be candid and generous, in his looking
over the following Sheets.</P>
<P>Here's no Apology to be made for Vice,
no extenuating of Crimes, no Harangues
for Drunkenness; when, at the same
time, the Liquors, which it has been
suggested are instrumental to our Immo∣ralitys,
are, as the Reader may think,
spoken favourably of.</P>
<P>But we are stating the Case of the
Distilling Business as a Commerce, and
of the Distillers as a Society improving
that Commerce, for the Good of their
Country; enquiring whether they are a
publick Good, and Encouragers of the
Trade yea or no: if they are, the Par∣liament
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> now sitting will
judge whether it is meet to encourage
them or not; and if not, <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5"/>
But it seems needful to hint, and this
is the Reason of this Preface, That the
Question does not seem to lie here, Whe∣ther
the Spirits shall be distill'd and con∣sum'd
among us, and whether the Poor
shall drink them? But, Whether the
<HI>Dutch</HI> shall surnish us with them, and
cheat and impose upon us, as well pub∣lickly
as privately, in the grossest and
most barefac'd manner? or whether our
own Manufacture shall supply us, our
own Growth be consum'd, and our own
People employ'd?</P>
<P>These are indeed very short Questi∣ons,
and I think few Words will decide
them: If the first be encourag'd, and
Fraud and clandestine Trade be continu∣ed,
for want of due Regulations, and
proper Measures taken to prevent it,
I shall only say it shall not be for want
of due Information. But if our own
Manufacture, the Labour and In∣dustry
of our own People, and the Con∣sumption
of our own Growth be encou∣rag'd,
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
as we cannot doubt they will, I
take the Liberty to say, the Distilling-Trade
in <HI>England,</HI> which is already so
much improv'd and encreas'd, will in a
very few Years conquer all foreign Im∣portations,
all the clandestine and cor∣rupt
Management of other Countries,
who impose upon us, and even the
smuggling and running of <HI>French</HI> Bran∣dy
itself.</P>
<P>The same Ignorance that occasions most
of the Prejudice at the Distilling Trade
among us, oblig'd me to enter into the
Detail of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Operations with
their Malt Spirits; and the first In∣troduction
of <HI>Geneva</HI> among the common
People, which otherwise some might
pretend is useless in the Case before us.
But 'tis needful we should know Things
in their Original, and be able to see
from what Fountain every Mischief
flows, that we may not lay the Weight
where it ought not to lie.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> were doubtless look'd up∣on
as great Benefactors to our Com∣merce,
and who by taking off yearly so
great a Quantity of our Corn, were so
great an Advantage to our Landed In∣terest,
our Navigation, and our Poor;
and while the Product, let it be what
it will, was consum'd abroad, and their
Geneva and other Spirits reach'd no
farther than their Camps and Fleets
(and withal while they did not cheat us
in the Draw-backs too, if ever that time
was) they were really so.</P>
<P>But here you will see that it is possible,
in the general turn of things, and the
Changes which matters of Trade, in com∣mon
with the rest of human Affairs, are
subject to, what is a publick Good to day,
may be a publick Grievance to morrow;
and what a Law is made to encourage
at one time, may require a Law to pro∣hibit
and prevent at another: And
this is the true Case of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dis∣tilling
Trade, as it shocks with, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
this time interferes with our own, as
will be seen from <HI>p.</HI> 24 to 36. of this
Work, in which an Account of that Part
is given.</P>
<P>Time, and a short Discourse, swell'd
also beyond expectation in other needful
parts, prevents entring further into
these things at present; but by this may
be seen the great Difficultys this valua∣ble
Business of the <HI>English</HI> Distillery
has struggled with, and the great and
just Arguments for its farther Encou∣ragement.
All which is humbly sub∣mitted
to the Wisdom and Justice of the
Parliament.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF
STATE
OF THE
CASE
OF THE
DISTILLERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Distilling of Spirits, is indeed an
antient Art; and the Distillers Com∣pany
is antient, having been incor∣porated
in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI>
But as the Nature of their Business is quite
chang'd, that they work in a new Method,
and from new Materials, are under new Limi∣tations,
and their Interest and Trade stand in a
new and quite different Situation from what
was the Case formerly; so it may be said,
their very Constitution is modern, and they
are young in the Manufacture.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
But however young the Trade may be, and
that the Materials they work from are diffe∣rent
from what they formerly made use of,
it is apparent, that they are infinitely more a
publick Benefit to the Nation, than they were
before; and that the Distilling Trade, consi∣dered
in its present Magnitude, is one of the
greatest Improvements, and the most to the
Advantage of the Publick, of any Business
now carried on in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In former Times, the Distillers, like other
incorporated Arts and Mysterys, work'd whol∣ly
for themselves and for their own Profit:
now they, without a <HI>Pun,</HI> may be truly said to
be <HI>publick spirited People;</HI> for they work for
the whole Body, and that immediately and
in a particular manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. They work for the Gentlemen or Land∣ed
Interest, in consuming the Produce of their
Soil, and encouraging Tillage and Husbandry.</P>
<P N="2">2. They work for the Tenant and Farmer,
in helping them off with their Corn, and
particularly in finding them a Market for those
Grains of the meanest Quality, and which it
would be difficult, if not impossible for them
to dispose of to Advantage any other way.</P>
<P N="3">3. They work for the Navigation of the
Kingdom; abundance of Shipping and other
Vessels, being daily and constantly, and some
wholly employ'd, in bringing the Corn and
Coal which is consum'd by the Distillers Trade,
up to <HI>London,</HI> from the remotest Parts of the
Kingdom.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
4. They work for the Poor; many Thou∣sands
of Familys being necessarily employ'd as
well in the Husbandry of the Corn they use,
as in the Malting it, then in carrying and re∣moving
it to and from the Malting-Places, to
the Ports for shipping it to <HI>London,</HI> or other∣wise
to <HI>London</HI> directly by Land.</P>
<P N="5">5. But above all this, they work for the
Publick in the extraordinary Sums of Money,
which they pay to the Crown, as well in the
Excise upon the Spirits they extract, as in
the Duty upon the Malt paid before it comes
to their Hands, and in the Tax upon Coals.</P>
<P>To explain these Particulars a little farther,
tho as briefly as we can, let it be consider'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. The landed Gentlemen must be sensible
the Distillers work for them, since the Distil∣ling
Trade in and about <HI>London</HI> only, con∣sumes
about 200000 Quarters of Corn, and
that Corn necessarily employs 100000 Acres
of Land for the Produce of it; for this kind of
Corn being generally the Product of the re∣mote
Countys, where the Lands are not rich,
we may venture to say, two Quarters upon
an Acre one with another, is no mean Crop,
and is sufficient to make a due Calculation
upon.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Horses employ'd in the Hus∣bandry
of 100000 Acres of Land every Year,
and in the Carriage of this Corn to the Mal∣sters,
and the Re-carriage of the Malt either to
the Market, or to the Port where it is to be
shipp'd, tho no guess can be made at their
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
Number; yet this may with Modesty be al∣lowed,
that those Cattle being very many,
must necessarily consume the Growth and Pro∣duce
of many Thousands of Acres of Land
more.</P>
<P>Nor is it sufficient to say, that if those Lands
did not produce this Corn, they would pro∣duce
something else; or that if the Distillers
did not take off and consume this Corn, some∣body
else would; seeing it is evident, <HI>England</HI>
being now become what they properly call
a Corn Country, produces much more Corn
than it can consume: And if that Consumption
should be lessen'd, many of those Lands must
lie uncultivated, as it is manifest many Thou∣sands
of Acres did before. It is also a receiv'd
Maxim, that every Quarter of Corn which is
carried off, and consum'd more than was con∣sum'd
before, (no Scarcity being occasioned at
Home) is so much clear Gain to the publick
Stock of the Nation.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that the Liquor distill'd is
consumed at Home, and so is not equally be∣neficial
to the publick Stock, as what is ex∣ported;
'tis answered, (1.) But much of it is
also exported, and more would be, if Encou∣ragement
were given. (2.) That most of what
is consumed at Home, is us'd in the stead and
room of French and Foreign Brandys and
Spirits, which are generally bought abroad with
ready Money, and smuggl'd on Shore to the
Ruin of the fair Trader, and lessening the Re∣venue
by a constant abcminable Fraud, and
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
which it appears no Laws yet made, have been
sufficient to prevent.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Tenant or Farmer is particularly
work'd for, being assisted by the Distilling
Trade, and that in several respects; as the
Distillers not only take off a great Quantity
of their Corn, but also take off those Kinds
which are not marketable for other Uses: As,
particularly, (1.) When thro' long Drought the
Grain appears thin and light, as is often the
Case; or by unseasonable Rains in Harvest the
Farmers cannot get their Corn well in; or when
by that or other Disasters and Accidents it is
damaged, either in the <HI>Field,</HI> or in the <HI>Barn,</HI>
in the <HI>Ear,</HI> or in the <HI>Sack;</HI> in all which Ca∣ses
the Farmer is put to great Difficulty to dis∣pose
of it, and were it not for the Distilling∣Trade
could do little with it but feed his Hogs,
which would not enable him to pay his Rent.
(2.) The Farmers have oftentimes Lands which
not only will not bear any other Corn, but
that for want of Manure and Improvement.
(which in some Places is hard to be had) of
thro' the Sterility and Poverty of the Soil, are
unable to produce either better Corn, or a bet∣ter
and fuller Grain of the Kind; and which
Lands, if they could not employ them thus,
must lie waste and untill'd, but are profitably
cultivated by the Vent which they find for that
meaner Kind of Grain to the Distillers. This
is visible in the Northern and Eastern Countys
and Coasts of <HI>England,</HI> where a very great
Quantity of poor and unimproveable Lands,
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
which formerly lay waste, are now plow'd and
sow'd, to the Advantage of the poor Tenants,
tho much more of the Landlord.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Encouragement given to Navigation
by the Distilling-Trade in <HI>England,</HI> is visible
in many Branches of it: For the Corn and the
Coals which they consume, being a bulky and
heavy Carriage, and not to be easily brought
far by Land, the Number of Coasting Ships and
Vessels of all Kinds are visibly encreas'd since
the Encrease of this Trade, and consequently
the Number of Seamen employ'd are encreas'd;
the Advantage of which is so well known, it
needs not be enlarg'd on: The Coasting-Navi∣gation
also being the greatest and best Nursery
of able Seamen in the whole Nation.</P>
<P>To the Encrease of the Number of Ships
and Vessels thus employ'd, might be added
here, the Addition which that Encrease is to
all the numerous Trades, both Foreign and
Home-Trades, and to the Employment of
Hands, and Encrease of Business, which ne∣cessarily
attends the building, fitting out, fur∣nishing,
and victualling all those Vessels. But
I forbear to run it out to its full Length, con∣tenting
my self to represent that this Trade is
a great Addition to the Marine Interest, and
an Encrease and Encouragement of all its De∣pendencys.</P>
<P>That
they work for the Poor is evident by
their setting the Poor to work, which indeed
is the best way of working for them. The
Number of Hands employ'd, or whose Em∣ployments
are bettered and encreased by this
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
Trade, would take up a Volume by it self to
calculate and cast it up. It is sufficient to say,
that as all Encrease of Business is an Encrease
of Employment for the Poor, so all Encrease
of Employment for the Poor is an Encrease of
the publick Stock; as it enables those People
to gain their Bread, who were not able to do
it, or not so well able, before. And this again
assists the landed Interest too, in abating the
heavy Rates of the Parish-Poor, and enabling
several thousands of poor People to support
themselves and Familys, which must otherwise
be left upon the Parishes to maintain.</P>
<P>This runs thro' all the several Branches of
Business and People, thro' whose Hands the said
Manufactures pass, as well the Distilling Part it
self, as the Materials made use of for the Pro∣duction,
as Corn and Coals, and the Shipping
and other Carriages already mentioned; as al∣so
the vast expensive Works of the Distillers
themselves, the Copper and Iron-Work they
make use of, the Vessels and large Utensils,
and the Number of Hands employ'd, and the
exceeding Charge daily expended by them in
all these Things.</P>
<P>But we wave the multiplying Particulars, and
come to the last Article, namely, the great Be∣nefit
to the Publick, arising by the Dutys with
which this Trade is loaded, and which have
now for many Years encreased the Funds upon
which the Publick Credit has been so long up∣upheld;
and these are considerable in three
Branches.<LIST>
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
<ITEM>1. The several Excises upon the Spirits
themselves, laid in several Branches and at seve∣ral
Times, and which amount in the whole to
above a hundred thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Duty upon Malt, which is paid by
the Distillers in the Price of the Goods, when
they buy, and which amounts to a very great
Sum.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Duty upon Coals, of which the
Distillers consume, by Calculation, above twen∣ty
thousand Chaldrons a Year.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Advantages of this Trade being thus
consider'd, it occurs in the next Place, to shew,
(1.) That this Trade is yet improving, that
it is a growing Trade, and that if not discou∣raged
by unreasonable Hardships and Imposi∣tions,
it is likely to encrease in an extraordi∣nary
manner. And, (2.) That this Encrease
is likely to be obtain'd, not by an Encrease of
Excesses and Immoralities, but by changing the
Gust of the People, from drinking those other
Spirits and Brandys, which being manufactu∣red,
corrupted, and adulterated abroad, are
not only imported, as well clandestinely as
otherwise, to the great Injury of the Health of
our People, but being bought by our ready
Money, are a great Disadvantage to our Com∣merce,
and Injury to the Revenue.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Distilling Trade is a still improv∣ing
and growing Business; and it is worth con∣sidering
to what a Height, and on what a just
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
Foundation it is likely to improve; for if it be
already, even while it is not much above twen∣ty
Years old, in its present Magnitude, so ad∣vanced,
as has been already said, as to pay so
great a Revenue to the Crown, and employ
such a prodigious Number of Acres of Land,
besides Ships, Cattle and Men, what may it
not do, when by the Improvement of the Art,
and the granting such Regulations by which
it would flourish, it shall from the mere Good∣ness
of the Goods that shall be produc'd, en∣tirely
suppress the Importation of Foreign Mix∣tures,
and even of French Brandy itself; the
Spirit distill'd from Corn in <HI>England,</HI> prevail∣ing
over them all by the Force of its own Me∣rit?</P>
<P>Nor
is this Question unworthy the Consi∣deration
of the Crown it self; whether the
Encouraging the Distilling Trade, is not really
a better and more effectual way to raise a Re∣venue
by it, than loading it with new Taxes,
which can have no other Effect than to lessen
the Consumption, and bring a rising Manufac∣ture
under a Decay.</P>
<P>It is evident, that as well by the Dearness of
French Brandy, and the Corruption and Fraud of
the Dutch Importation, as by the improv'd and
still advancing Goodness of the English Malt
Spirit, which I shall make appear is coming
fairly up to be equal to the best French Brandy;
the great and opiniated Gust of the People to
French and Foreign Brandy, is already much
abated, and the Consumption of our own Pro∣duct
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
gains Ground on them every Day, to
the great Advantage of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>As the Consumption encreases, the publick
Revenue encreases of course, without the
Addition of new Taxes, with this undeniable
Difference to the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI>
namely, That this way as the Revenue en∣creases,
all the fore-mentioned Advantages
will encrease: The Quantity of Lands to be
cultivated, will encrease: The Advantage to
the Farmer, the Employment of Cattle, Ships
and Men, will all encrease with it▪ where∣as
by burdening the Trade with new Dutys,
it cannot be pretended the Consumption will
encrese, tho the Duty should; on the con∣trary,
if it should decrease, as is most natural,
the Dearness of all Goods lessening the Con∣sumption,
then all those national Advantages
above must decrease in proportion.</P>
<P>As to the weak Pretences of the Malt Spi∣rits
being destructive to the Health of the Peo∣ple,
they seem only fit to be jested with, as they
have been: and I must say, I am sorry to see
some Magisterial People have expos'd their
Weakness in this Point so much.</P>
<P>They have no where shew'd the World a
Reason why as good and wholesom a Spirit may
not be drawn from the Corn, (whose mere De∣coction
in other Preparations is allow'd to be
so good) as from any other Materials; and if, as
the Learned say, the Spirit only is the nutritive
Part of all our Food, whether Meat or Drink,
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
there can then be no question, but that a Spirit
carefully extracted from the gross and humid
Parts, and faithfully prepared without any A∣dulterations
or corrupt Mixtures, must be as
wholesom to the Body, as the same Spirit un∣extracted
and mix'd with the common Liquids
by Infusion and Ebullition; or as any Spirit ex∣tracted
from other Principles of any kind what∣soever.</P>
<P>As
for the Excesses and Intemperances of
the People, and their drinking immoderate
Quantitys of Malt Spirits, the Distillers are
not concern'd in it at all; their Business is to
prepare a Spirit wholesom and good. If the
People will destroy themselves by their own
Excesses, and make that Poison, which is o∣therwise
an Antidote; 'tis the Magistrate's Bu∣siness
to help that, not the Distillers. 'Tis
humbly conceiv'd also, they would do the
same with Foreign Brandy and Spirits, if there
was no distilling at Home in the whole Na∣tion.</P>
<P>It
is in the next place, humbly offered to
the Publick to consider, what a Trade, and
how ruinous to the Nation in several consi∣derable
Articles, the Distilling Trade in <HI>England</HI>
is now opposed to; and how necessary it is to
have that pernicious Commerce, if possible,
suppress'd. And this Part is the more useful,
because it seems very few, even of our most
penetrating Gentlemen, are fully Masters of
it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="20"/>
Were the Foreign Importation of Spirits
confin'd only to that Species we call French,
which it is generally allow'd is a wholesom
and well extracted Spirit; yet as the French
Brandys are a Product infinitely injurious to
our Commerce, bought from a Nation with
whom we having no Treaty of Commerce,
cannot exchange our Manufactures, but must
pay for them in Specie, to the evident turning the
Ballance of Trade against us: In this respect
they are injurious to the Health of the Publick,
if not to the Health of particular Bodys; and
consequently 'tis a publick Good to discourage
them, and abate their Consumption.</P>
<P>But when we come to speak of the Foreign
Spirits, (however falsly call'd Brandys) it is e∣vident
there the Case differs extremely, and we
are so great Sufferers in that Part, as well in
respect to the Health of the Body as the Pros∣perity
of Commerce, and the Frauds put upon
the Crown to the great Loss of the Revenue;
that as it is a publick Good in our Distilling
Trade, that we gain upon and lessen that
Trade, so it must be some Service to expose
the Abuses of it, and let our People see how
gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly they are impos'd upon in it, both in
the publick and private Interest of our Coun∣try</P>
<P>To
set this dark Commerce in a clear Light,
'tis needful to take notice, by what unhappy
Artifice the subtle Dutch Traders are enabled,
our own Weakness concurring, not only to un∣derwork
us, but to impose upon us, and sell
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
us Spirits distill'd from our own Materials,
cheaper than we can make them at Home;
tho as it happens, their Avarice, so natural to
their Climate, will not suffer them to make
them so good.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, we are to suppose they have the
Malt from <HI>England,</HI> as generally they have
from <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>The Fraud begins at the very Beginning; for
the <HI>Dutch</HI> approving to have their Malt far
grown on the Floor, and without dressing and
skreening off the Tails, as we call them; the
Malster lets it run in such manner, that 20
Quarter of Barley shall measure out 40 Quar∣ter
of Malt: I speak within Compass, for it
has been known to measure 50 to 60 Quar∣ter,
from 20. Now the Fraud of this lies
here, The Malt in the Maker's Hands be∣ing
gaged in the Barley, the Duty, which is
4<HI>s. per</HI> Quarter, is paid by the Measure or
Gage of the Barley wetted; so the Score, or
20 Quarter pays 4<HI>l.</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>When this Barley is malted, and the Malt
comes to be exported, the Duty of 4<HI>s. per</HI>
Quarter is drawn back by Debenture; and then
the Malt being measured anew, the 20 Quar∣ter
being encreased to 40, draws back upon
that Measure, and so the Exporter receives 8<HI>l.</HI>
Draw-back, upon that which paid but 4<HI>l.</HI> Du∣ty.
This is so vile a Fraud, and so openly
practis'd, that nothing is more wonderful to
me, than that no notice has yet been taken of
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
it, except this, that being so well known no
care has been taken to put a stop to it.</P>
<P>But it does not end here: As there is a
Draw-back allowed for the Malt-Duty, upon
all the exported Malt, so there is a Bounty
paid to the Exporter, by the Crown, for the
encouraging the Exportation; and this is 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.
per</HI> Quarter more, which being likewise paid
upon the 40 Quarter made out of 20, encrea∣ses
the Fraud 5<HI>l.</HI> more. So that the Crown
pays back to the Exporter 13<HI>l.</HI> for every Score
of Barley malted, and receives but 4<HI>l.</HI> by
which it is no wonder that the Malt-Tax should
be deficient.</P>
<P>Suppose then the <HI>Dutch</HI> pay a sham Price <HI>per</HI>
Quarter for their Malt, and thus receive double
for it again, it is no wonder that they can distil
a Spirit from it cheaper than the Distillers in
<HI>England,</HI> who fairly pay 6<HI>s. per</HI> Bushel to
the Crown for all their Malt, and full 6<HI>d.</HI> a
Gallon for the Spirits they draw from it.</P>
<P>Nor have the <HI>Dutch</HI> done with us yet; but
let us examine it thorowly, and we shall see a
greater Fraud yet behind.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> I know not by what Error on
our Side, are allow'd to import here foreign
Brandy, the Duty upon Importation being 4<HI>s.</HI>
2<HI>d. per</HI> Gallon, or thereabouts; whereas the
<HI>French</HI> Brandy pays 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d. per</HI> Gallon. This
our People take up with, and call it <HI>French</HI>
Brandy; and having sufficient Proof that it
comes from abroad, are satisfied with it as
such.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="23"/>
The <HI>Dutch</HI> tell us, it is not <HI>French,</HI> tho we
have good Reason to believe that all the real
Brandy that is in it is <HI>French,</HI> by which we
are cheated that way. But that is not the
Case; 'tis apparent, the <HI>Dutch</HI> mix their own
Malt Spirits with this Brandy, and send it to
us, while our People, deluded with the Notion
that it must be right Brandy, because it comes
by a foreign Permit, eagerly buy it for right
Brandy, and give a Price accordingly.</P>
<P>Let any one judge then under what Disad∣vantages
we carry on this Trade with the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and how much it is the Interest of
<HI>England</HI> to put a Stop to it; and granting it is
our Interest, the next thing is to consider what
is the Way to do it: And that is easily an∣swer'd;
the only Way is, to discourage the
Importation of their adulterated Brandys, and
encourage and encrease the Distilling Trade at
home, by which so many Advantages accrue
to the Nation, and the Consequences of which
would yet be greater than perhaps is expected,
or than is thought possible, except by some Men
of more Penetration than ordinary, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The People will by little and little be
brought off from being so fond of foreign Spi∣rits,
by the Difficulty of coming at them, and
the Badness of their Quality; as we see the
Taste of the Nation was effectually brought
off from the <HI>French</HI> to <HI>Portuguese</HI> Wines, by
the Prohibitions and high Dutys of the late
War.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="24"/>
2. The Distillers here are apparently able
to make as good, as fine, as clean and as whole∣som
a Spirit, from our own Materials, as any
of those imported from abroad; infinitely bet∣ter
than the <HI>Dutch:</HI> and as they are every
Day improving, will very soon, if they are
not discourag'd, be able to outdo even the
<HI>French</HI> Brandy itself. And it is apparent they
produce so fine a Spirit already, that a very
nice Palate cannot distinguish it from <HI>French;</HI>
and had they the <HI>Dutch</HI> Trick of importing it
from abroad, they might easily sell it for
<HI>French</HI> Brandy, among the People.</P>
<P>I foresee, that as abundance of People are
apt ignorantly to charge the Immoralitys, and
particularly the Drunkenness of the Age, up∣on
the great Encouragement of the distilling
Malt Spirits; so they would make that grow∣ing
Evil, a Reason against the just Encou∣ragement,
which ought to be given to the
Business of the Distillers as a Trade; as if
the encouraging the Distillers Business, would
be an encouraging of Drunkenness: whereas
we are speaking of it, as a needful and an
advantageous Commerce; a Benefit to the
Publick, to the Poor, and to the whole Na∣tion.
And that would be infinitely more so,
if it may be encourag'd, in keeping out and
putting a stop to that Foreign pernicious Com∣merce,
carried on to our great Loss and Disad∣vantage.
As to the Vice of Drinking to Ex∣cess,
we are no way concern'd in it; the
Brewing Trade, and the Wine Trade, are liable
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
to the same Objections: Yet I do not find it
argued by any body, that therefore we must
have no Beer, nor Wine.</P>
<Q><L>So hasty Showers, when they from Heaven flow down,</L>
<L>Are sent to fructify, and not to drown;</L>
<L>And in the Torrent if a Drunkard sink,</L>
<L>'Tis not the Brook that drowns him but the Drink.</L>
<L>But twou'd be hard, because the Sinner's slain,</L>
<L>For fear of Drowning, we must have no Rain.</L></Q>
<P>But to clear up this Case, upon which so
much weak Cavilling has been made, I beg
leave in a kind of Historical way, to enter a
little into the State of National Drinking in
<HI>England,</HI> as it has been, and as it now is. And
tho I shall be very brief, I slatter myself it
shall be both useful and diverting; especially,
I answer for it, that it shall come directly to
the Case in hand; and clear not only the Dis∣tillers
and the Distilling Trade, but even all
the Liquors they make, from the Charge of
being destructive to the Morals of the People,
or an Encouragement to Drunkenness and Ex∣cess,
any otherwise than, nay not so much as,
all strong Liquors are so to those, who drink to
Excess.</P>
<P>Our Drunkenness as a National Vice, takes
its Epocha at the Restoration <HI>Anno</HI> 1661-62, or
within a very few Years after. Some run it back
to <HI>James</HI> I. Time, and refer us to the Paint∣ings
on the Ceiling of the Banqueting-House,
for Proof of it; but I am not writing Satyres;
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
I am upon a Search after not so much the Vice,
as the Materials and Manufactures upon which
it is fed, and by which it was supported.</P>
<P>Joy, Mirth, good Cheer, and good Li∣quor,
were the Solace of the common People
in the Year 1661. They rejoiced that after
a long Usurpation, the King should enjoy his
own again; that after a long Series of Blood
and Confusion, and a Civil War in the Bowels
of their Country, the People should enjoy a
publick Peace and Tranquillity; that Trade
should flourish, and Plenty succeed Misery and
Want. These were the several Reasons of their
Joy; and very merry, and very mad, and very
drunken, the People were, and grew more and
more so every Day.</P>
<P>As to the Materials, Beer and Ale were con∣siderable
Articles; they went a great way in
the Work at first, but were far from being suf∣ficient.
Strong Waters, which had not been
long in Use, came in play; the Occasion was
this: In the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, it had been obser∣ved,
That the Captains of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Men
of War, when they were to engage with our
Ships, usually set a Hogshead of Brandy a∣broach,
afore the Mast; and bid the Men <HI>drink
lustick,</HI> then they might <HI>fight lustick:</HI> and our
poor Seamen felt the Force of the Brandy,
sometimes to their cost.</P>
<P>We were not long behind them; but sudden∣ly
after the War, we began to abound in strong
Water-Shops. These were a sort of petty Dis∣tillers,
who made up those compound Waters
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
from such mixt and confus'd Trash, as they
could get to work from, such as damag'd and
eager, or sour Wines; Wines that had taken
Salt Water in at Sea; Lees and Bottoms; also
damag'd Sugars, and Melasses, Grounds of Sy∣der,
and innumerable other such like. For till
then there was very little Distilling known
in <HI>England,</HI> but for physical Uses. The Spi∣rits
they drew were foul, and gross; but they
mixt them up with such Additions as they
could get, to make them palatable, and so
gave them in general, the Name of <HI>Cordial Wa∣ters.</HI>
And thus the strong-Water-Shops usu∣ally
made a vast Show of Glasses, labell'd
and written on, like the <HI>Gallypot Latin of
the Apothecarys,</HI> with innumerable hard
Names to set them off.</P>
<P>Here, as at a Fountain, the good Wives fur∣nish'd
their little Fire-side Cupboards, with a
needful Bottle for a cherishing Cup: And
hence, as from wholesale Dealers, all the little
Chandlers Shops, not in <HI>London,</HI> and its ad∣jacent
Parts only, but over great Part of
<HI>England,</HI> were furnish'd for Sale; and to the
personal Knowledge of the Writer hereof, and
of Thousands still living, not the Chandlers
Shops only, but just as is now complain'd of,
the Barbers Shops (<HI>Barber Chirurgeons</HI> they
were then called) were furnished with the same,
and sold it by Retail, to the poor People who
came under their Operations.</P>
<P>And why should it be so suprising a Thing
then in our Opinion, that the <HI>Geneva</HI> which,
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
as I shall show presently, is but the same Thing
returned again, should be so generally received
among the inferior Poor? seeing would we but
look thus a little way behind us, it would ap∣pear
that it was so with our Ancestors; and
our poor People are only set down where their
Fore-fathers were before them, (as to the Li∣quors
I mean.) As to the Difference of the
Quantitys, and whether they drank more to
Excess, than our People do now, that is a
Question by itself, and not much to the pre∣sent
Case.</P>
<P>But it is objected, They did not drink such
destructive Liquors then, as we do now: That
is, in short, they did not drink <HI>Geneva;</HI> for
that is the Meaning of it.</P>
<P>This Objection must be spoken to as we go
along; because it comes into the History I am
upon; for it leads me to give a brief Account
of what they did drink, and where they had
it. I have mentioned the Introduction of the
strong-Water-Shops, and petty Distillers, who
began this Trade. I come now to the Liquors;
some of their Names were as follow.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Aqua Vitae.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aqua Mirabilis.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aqua Solis.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Aqua Dulcis.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>Cholick Water, which in short was <HI>Geneva.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>These and many more in <HI>English.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
<P>But to sum up the whole, <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> and An∣niseed
Water, were the Captains or Leaders;
and the strong Inclinations of the People run all
into those two: And in a little while the latter
prevail'd over the former too; and as Anniseed
Water was the only Liquor for some Years, the
Quantity that was drunk of it, was prodigious
great: In a word, it was the <HI>Geneva</HI> of these
Times, it was not only sold in the Chandlers
Shops, and in the Barbers Shops, as above;
and perhaps in Bulks and Stalls too; but it
had this particular Article attending it, (which
we are not yet arrived to with the <HI>Geneva</HI>)
<HI>viz.</HI> That it was cried about Sreets, of which,
the Memory of the famous <HI>Anniseed Robin,</HI>
will be a never-dying Testimony; who was so
well known in <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> and the <HI>Stocks-Market</HI>
for his Liquor, and his broad-brim'd∣Hat,
that it became proverbial, when we saw
a Man's Hat hanging about his Ears, to say,
<HI>he looks like Anniseed Robin.</HI></P>
<P>This Part, <HI>viz.</HI> of going about the Streets,
and into the Fields, to Shows, and Musters of
the Trained Bands, to cry a <HI>Dram of the Bot∣tle,</HI>
has not been so long omitted, but that we
can all remember it: And the Bumboats, who
continue to this Day, crying a <HI>Dream of the
Bottle,</HI> in the River, among the Ships, are a
Remainder of that Custom, and which was ne∣ver
left off at-all.</P>
<P>I should not however have troubled you
with these Instances from <HI>Low Life,</HI> but that
it is in the Scene we are now acting; and this
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
<HI>Anniseed Robin</HI> was a magnipotent Fellow in
his Day, I assure you.</P>
<P>Having thus brought you back to the Dram∣drinking
Age, I must let you see how a full
Stop was put to it on a sudden, and what be∣came
of the drinking World in the mean time.</P>
<P>As all these various sorts of good Liquor
had their Meridian, so they had too their De∣clination,
and after some time they fell into a
general Dislike: For the French out-did them
exceedingly, and pouring in their Liquors at
a very cheap rate, and the Goodness of the
Brandy recommending it self also, the famous
<HI>Anniseed Water</HI> began to lose Ground, and
the People took their Drams in plain Brandy;
the Physicians also, on all Occasions, telling
the People, it was better than any of their com∣pounded
Waters.</P>
<P>Thus the best Brandy being sold for 2<HI>d. per</HI>
Quartern, the Poor could have a large Dram
for a Half-penny; and the Fellows that cry'd
it about the Streets, carry'd with them little
double Dram-Cups, which being held up on one
side was a Penny, and on the other side a
Half-penny.</P>
<P>This held on for several Years, and the Cus∣tom-house
Books will shew the prodigious Con∣sumption,
till the late Revolution; when a fu∣rious
and continu'd War the <HI>France</HI> breaking
out, a Prohibition of Trade follow'd, Brandy
rose from 2<HI>d.</HI> to 6<HI>d. per</HI> Quartern, and from
thence to a Scarcity, so that none good was
be had. The Distillers not being yet come into
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
the way of Distilling from Malt, could not sup∣ply
them; and thus the Poor were thrown off
from the Dram-Cup to the Alehouse-Pot, to
their great Regret, as well as Expence: For
now they could call for nothing less than a
Pint, which tho for a while it was but a Pen∣ny,
yet soon after, by doubling the Excise,
came up to three Half-pence, where it still
stays. And thus I have gone thro' the first
Part of my History.</P>
<P>It remains a Question, which I believe is
not yet determin'd, tho I see not much Diffi∣culty
in it, Whether the Morals of the People
were the better or the worse by this Change?
If I may use so much Freedom, I insist that they
are much the worse: And as my Reasons for
it are of some weight in the present Debate, I
beg you will hear them summ'd up as briefly for
your Convenience as I can.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Charge was immediately increas'd,
and a poor Man that could before be refresh'd
in his Labour, at the small Expence of a Half∣penny,
was now oblig'd to spend three Half∣pence
at a time, as often as either Necessity or
Inclination call'd him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Expence of Time was immediately al∣so
encreas'd; for then poor Men in their Stails,
or Garrets, or Shops, or wherever they were
at their work, could call in, and call up, poor
<HI>Anniseed Robin,</HI> or any of his Contemporarys
or Successors, and take a Dram, without the
least Loss of their Time, and go on with their
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
Work: Or if they were at Day-Labour in the
Field or the Street, in the Wet and the Cold,
they could call for a Dram for a Penny or a
Half-Penny, as their Pockets could afford, and
go on with their Business; whereas upon this
Change the Poor were really distress'd, and
they made loud Complaints of it, as I very well
remember.</P>
<P>Having thus gone thro' the History of what's
past, and given you some Account of the man∣ner
of our Drinking till within these few Years,
allow me to bring it on to our own Times, and
view our Poor in the present Situation of their
great Affair, I mean of Liquor; for what they
shall drink is (I assure you) no matter of mean
Concern to them.</P>
<P>The Poor, as above, having been reduc'd to
the miserable Necessity of this Alehouse-Tip∣pling,
and grown sick of the tedious and dull,
as well as expensive way of Drinking, were ap∣parently
ripe for a Change, if they could have
found any way to their Advantage; when on
a sudden the diligent <HI>Dutch,</HI> fruitful <HI>at Inven∣tion,</HI>
as the <HI>English</HI> are at <HI>Imitation,</HI> (and
with their own Advantage at the bottom you
may be sure,) help'd them out again, <HI>as they
had done once before:</HI> for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Sutlers
carry'd into the Camps in <HI>Flanders,</HI> during
the late long Wars against <HI>France,</HI> a certain
new distill'd Water call'd <HI>Geneva,</HI> being a good
wholesom Malt Spirit, if rightly prepar'd,
wrought up with Juniper-Berries; a Thing not
only wholesom, but really physical, and for
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
many Years allow'd to be so by the most cele∣brated
Physicians.</P>
<P>It was strange to observe, how this Liquor
prevail'd in the Army; how the Soldiers were
surprized at the Goodness of it; the Spirit,
the Vigor it put into them: They declar'd
publickly to one another, there never was
any such Liquor heard of in the World; it put
a perfectly new Spirit, and new Life into
them; and invigorated them at such a rate,
that it made them quite a new kind of Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>At
first, like the Champaign and Burgundy,
it was drank among the Gentlemen only; a
Drink for Generals, and for Officers: Nay,
they tell us in <HI>Holland,</HI> that even the great
D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> of <HI>M<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> gave it a Character as a Thing
that inspir'd Nature with a new Flame; and
put a sort of Vigor into the Mind, which Nature
itself was a Stranger to before; and that he
recommended the (moderate) Use of it, to
the greatest Men, when they were going at
any time to engage the Enemy.</P>
<P>It is a great Mistake to argue from hence,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> always made their Soldiers mad
with Drink, before they led them out to
fight; for what I am saying of them now, is
of the Generals and Officers, before the Sol∣diers
came to have any fellow-feeling of this
Article.</P>
<P>At first, no doubt the <HI>Dutch</HI> made a fine
Spirit of it, and as perfect as it was possible to
be expected: But as the <HI>Dutch</HI> are hardly to
be charged with any Deficiency in needful
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
Craft, and that they saw plainly what was good
for the High, was also good for the Low; and
that the poor Soldiers Money was as good to
them as the great Generals, if they could but
make it out in Quantity; they soon came into
the old Trading Maxim, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapness
causes Consumption, and found out a Way to
make a Sort of the same Spirit, and drawn
perhaps from the same Ingredients; that be∣ing
made meaner in Quality, should be propor∣tioned
to the Purse, as well as to the Palate
of the common Soldiers.</P>
<P>And thus the Soldiers in the Confederate
Camp, came to the honour of Drinking upon
a Level with their Officers, or at least, flat∣tering
themselves that they did so, which in∣deed
was almost the same Thing; and if there
was any apparent Difference, it was such that
neither Officers or Soldiers were nice enough
in their Palates to judge of.</P>
<P>It would interrupt our Business and the main
Design of this Work, to dwell too long upon
the particular Steps and Gradations, by which
<HI>Geneva</HI> gain'd so much upon the Minds of the
common People; or to enquire into the Rea∣sons
of it: If what I have said, <HI>viz.</HI> its being
thus approved by their general Officers, gave
the first Occasion, it is sufficient to tell you,
that by this means the <HI>Geneva</HI> gain'd a vast Cre∣dit
among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops; from the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> it spread universally among all the Con∣federate
Armys; and the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers be∣came
as great Admirers of it, as any other
Nation whatsoever; except the mere <HI>Dutch</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
themselves, for they indeed drank it like Mo∣thers-Milk.</P>
<P>But
you are to take notice here, that the subtle
Distillers, and particularly the wise Merchants
of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> who had felt the Sweet of the
Trade, had consulted together to bring this Part
to sute with their Interest also; namely, That
the <HI>Geneva</HI> which they sent to the Army for the
Use of the Officers and Gentlemen, (especially
General Officers) bore a different Price from
that which was open'd for the ordinary use of
the Army, and for the common Soldiers: Whe∣ther
it differ'd in Virtue and Value or not, I
cannot enter into here; for in such Liquors as
these, I shall not answer for it, that what is sold
for the highest Price, is always of best Qua∣lity
in proportion: sometimes, Fancy ground∣ed
upon an advanc'd Demand, answers to
Goodness, and makes an Equivalent to the
Quality of the Liquor; nor could those litle
needful Frauds be always carried on without it:
but of that by itself.</P>
<P>Let this Part be one way or other, and be
the Liquor better or worse, this is certain, the
Price was reduc'd in the common Suttlers-Car∣riages;
and the poor Soldiers had their <HI>Gin</HI> at
a Rate fit for a poor Soldier to pay: And this
too betray'd a Secret in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commerce,
which it has been proper to mention already;
and for the sake of which, this Part has been
mention'd here; and is absolutely necessary to
speak of, namely, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> were ena∣bled
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
to bring down the Price of their <HI>Geneva,</HI>
even without reducing the Goodness.</P>
<P>I must be allow'd to say, that it seems ex∣ceeding
hard, that as our Distillers were not
then come into the Thing, and that <HI>Geneva</HI> was
not known here; they should find themselves
so oppressed, at their first Entrance; and the
<HI>Dutch</HI> should be able not only to make their
own Spirits <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI> cheapter than we
could, but that they shall be still able to import
them upon us fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than we
can make them, and yet raise them from the
same Materials, namely, from our own Corn.</P>
<P>And here there is such an allow'd Conces∣sion
made by the whole Legislature of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> to one of the Articles summ'd up in
the first Part of this Work, namely, of the
vast Advantage the consuming of Corn is to the
Landed Interest, that I could not but remind the
Reader of it; namely, The allowing back all
the Duty upon Malt, and 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> Bounty-Money
upon the exporting it as Barley, which
if the Sums drawn back by Certificate, in the
Countries of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> only, are cast
up, will appear surprising in Value: I say, it
is a full Concession to our Argument, and no∣thing
but a full Conviction that the exporting
it, is infinitely advantageous to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
can be a justifiable Reason for it.</P>
<P>Were the Commons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to have
been told when that Law was made, that all
or the greatest Part of the Bounty, whatever
Sums were drawn from the Publick by it, would
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
only have two Effects, and both of them per∣nicious
to the British Commerce in general, and
to the Revenue in particular; it is my Opinion
they would have consider'd better of it, before
they had pass'd it into a Law, or have put it in
the Power of a voracious Set of Men, to have
ruin'd so great and rising a Manufacture, and
Branch of our Commerce, at our own Expence.</P>
<P>Were those Bountys taken off for a while,
or were they reduc'd a little to a tolerable De∣gree,
the Consequence would presently be this,
That the <HI>Dutch</HI> could no more draw a Spirit
50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper from our own Materials,
than we could, or import it upon us, mixt
among <HI>French</HI> or other Foreign Brandys, so
much to our Disadvantage.</P>
<P>What Reason can be alledged, why the
<HI>Dutch</HI> should be able to extract a better Spirit
from the fame Goods? Nay, it is evident,
they do not, and we are assur'd they cannot;
but they have gotten into a Course of uncon∣trolled
K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ry, and by this they can send it
over cheaper, and that is sufficient to all the
rest; for Cheapness causes Consumption.</P>
<P>But to return to the Article above: When
first the <HI>Dutch</HI> came into this Trade, as I
hinted before <HI>p.</HI> 25. they took their Malt so
rough, so grown, and so undress'd, that it was
frequent for a Score of <HI>English</HI> Barley at that
time, to hold out 50 to 60 quarters of Malt,
at the Exportation; which accordingly magni∣fied
the Fraud, and entitled the Exporter to
receive back twelve Pound for a Score of Bar∣ley;
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
which upon being gaug'd in the Cistern,
paid to the Crown but 4<HI>l.</HI> Duty; and so again
in the Bounty: But they have been pleas'd to
be a little less barefac'd since, and have (thanks
to their Modesty) reduc'd it by a slight Dres∣sing,
as above, to forty Quarters for twenty.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> There is a little Cavil which may
be rais'd here; and we doubt not our Oppo∣sers
will think, they have some Advantage in
it, namely, That the Barley does generally
swell one in the Score, before the gauging:
but we may answer that by itself.</P>
<P>To what Extremes do we see wise Men run,
upon wrong Information of Things; and yet
how little Care do they take to be rightly and
better inform'd of the Things they are mista∣ken
about? It will perhaps be very hard to
persuade Men of common Sense to believe,
that the <HI>Dutch</HI> can import their Spirits ex∣tracted
from our Materials, 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheap∣er
than we can make them; and yet, at the
same time prove too, that all the ordinary Parts
of the Workmanship about them, may be per∣formed
as cheap in <HI>London,</HI> as in <HI>Amsterdam.</HI></P>
<P>But it must be confessed, that when they
come to be more fully and rightly inform'd of
things, and to see what a Cheat is put upon the
<HI>English</HI> Crown, in the Conditions upon which
they get their Corn, which are the Materials;
the Riddle is expounded presently, and we
cannot suppose Men to have common Sense,
who will not then open their Eyes to it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="39"/>
But to come back to theCamp: Our sol∣diers
tasting this Liquor, brought the De∣sire,
as well as the Fame of it, over with
them <HI>at the ensuing Peace;</HI> and our Dis∣tillers
preparing it as well here, as the <HI>Dutch</HI>
abroad, they supply'd the People with it,
wrought from our own Corn the Product of
our own Land, very much to our Advan∣tage,
as has been said already: the Encrease
of the Demand, afterwards encreassing the Con∣sumption
of our own Malt, to a very great
degree.</P>
<P>It seems, <HI>Bacchus</HI> and the <HI>Brewer</HI> take Um∣brage
at this Invasion: and tho what between
the <HI>Wine-Brewer,</HI> and the <HI>Beer-Brewer,</HI> they
have had the poisoning Trade to themselves to
long, that one would think they should be sa∣tiated
with the Mischiefs of it, tho they were
not with the Profits, yet it seems they do not
sit easy under it; tho I am told the Pretence
of the Brewing Trade being declined on this
Account, is but a Pretence, and no more. It
seems they could have been content with it in
the Apothecarys Shops, and allow'd it among
the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to pass for good Phy∣sick:
but when they found it applied to the
defeat of <HI>Tippling</HI> and <HI>Sotting,</HI> as above, they
resolv'd against it, as fatal and destructive to the
Health, and Understanding; and that as to the
Tempers of the People, it was safer to be drunk
with any thing, rather than <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="40"/>
It is a poor Foundation to raise Clamour
upon; <HI>viz.</HI> To single out the vicious Temper
of the Poor, to exclaim against; when here
is a Vice in our Trade, that wants reforming
first, and which if an End were put to it,
would both do the Crown and the Revenue
Justice: It would block up the Door to any
more <HI>Dutch</HI> Cheats, (of this kind at least) and
put it into our own Power to reform the rest
with more ease; and till then, I doubt, it will
never be reformed, while we live.</P>
<P>It has been suggested by some, (how weak∣ly,
we shall see presently) that burdening the
Distilling Trade in <HI>England</HI> with new Dutys,
will be a Means to cure all the Evils which
they acknowledge seem to be growing upon
us, by the immoderate Use or drinking of the
Malt Spirits, among the Poor. If these Mens
Zeal for the Reformation of the People, was
no greater than their Knowledge of the true
Interest of their Country; they would never
propose a Method which should only shut the
Door against the drinking our own Manufac∣ture,
our Spirits distill'd at home, and open the
Door to a Flux or Tide of the same, or worse
Spirits imported from <HI>Holland,</HI> and so bring
in <HI>Dutch</HI> Drunkenness among us too: which,
by the way, is yet something of a worse kind
than our own, feeding the Intemperance of the
People with the same or worse Ingredients;
but giving the <HI>Dutch</HI> the Profit of it, and lea∣ving
us nothing but the Poverty and the Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="41"/>
Had not this preposterous Notion started itself
into the World, just when these Sheets were in
the Press, and so fair an Opportunity was left to
answer and expose it, this Tract had not swell'd
to such a bulk: but since the Politicks of these
Gentlemen have taken such a Turn, and this
Flight of their Wit has carried them to such a
height, I must trespass a little on the Patience
of the Gentlemen, that shall see these Sheets, to
give in a Word or two, upon so weighty a Sug∣gestion.</P>
<P>All
wise Crowns, and ours of <HI>England</HI> in
particular, make it a Maxim in their laying
Dutys, <HI>never by loading their own Product,</HI>
to encourage Importations from abroad, in
prejudice of the same Goods manufactur'd at
Home. But if it shall be prov'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. That burthening the <HI>English</HI> Distillery,
will only serve to encrease the Advantage of
Foreigners, and ruin the Manufacture of Spirits
distill'd from our own Corn at Home; how
will it answer the wise Maxims of State and
of Trade, which we all depend so much upon?</P>
<P N="2">2. If it shall appear that such a burthening
the Manufacture at Home, will but encrease
the Frauds of Foreigners; and instead of detec∣ting
the vilest clandestine Commerce in <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
and the opennest and grossest Abuse of
Parliamentary Bounty, with a lessening to the
publick Good, which it was appointed to en∣crease;
wherre then will the good End of the
Parliament be answered; and how well are
such People qualified for Politicians?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="42"/>
And if after all it should further appear that
the Proposal itself comes from a Quarter where
no such sanative Principles as these of preserving
our Trade are to be found; but that it is all
from a View to separate and corrupt Ends,
tending in themselves to support the Interest of
a Set of Men, who carry on a Trade a thou∣sand
times more pernicious to Trade and to the
Morals of the People than this: I say, if this
should be prov'd by it all, then it must give
a new Turn to our Conceptions about these
Things themselves; we must run 'em all over
again in our Thoughts.</P>
<P>Let us then endeavour to state the Case clear∣ly,
among us</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <HI>Dutch</HI> do cheat, and impose
upon us already, most grosly and barefacedly;
or rather to put it right, the Exporters of the
Malt to <HI>Holland,</HI> do cheat and impose upon
us: (for if the <HI>Dutch</HI> are not the Men, let us
not wrong the Devil, but lay the Saddle on the
right Horse.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That by this Cheat, let who will be in it,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Distillers (for we are not talking
of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as a Nation, but as Traders, and
especially as Distillers) are enabled to buy
their Malt for less than half the Price which
our <HI>English</HI> Distillers give for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. That by this means they are likewise ena∣bled
to work their Spirits (whether the <HI>Gene∣va</HI>
or other Spirits) for we are not now speaking
of one sort more than another, so cheap as to
sell them one time with another for at least 50
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
<HI>per Cent.</HI> less Price, than our Distillers can
work them for, from the same Materials.</P>
<P N="4">4. That by the Advantages, Disguises, and va∣rious
Kinds of crafty Ways which the <HI>Dutch</HI>
have, for disposing and dispersing these Spirits
among our People, under the Names of Fo∣reign
Brandys, and by the Aid of Foreign Per∣mits,
(for they always find the way to
make us the Tools of our own Delusions) they
have an Opportunity to sell that 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
dearer than we do, which they can make 50
<HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper.</P>
<P>Let any considering Person take these Things
in pieces a little, and examine them separately.</P>
<P>All Errors and Mistakes of Mankind, are
much better and easier prevented in Principle,
than corrected in Practice; as Fire is easier
suppress'd in the Sparks, than in the Flame:
The first and grossest of all the Mischiefs that
can be complain'd of in the Distilling Trade, are
founded in this Original Fraud of putting 13<HI>l.</HI>
of the Crown-Money in the Pocket of the
Exporters, for every Score of Barley which is
malted for their Exportation, whether to <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
or any other Part, and for which they
pay 4<HI>l.</HI> Duty, and no more, or very little
more, as has been said.</P>
<P>Let us first see the Magnitude of this Cheat,
and then a little of the Consequence of it:
Suppose the <HI>Dutch</HI> take off an hundred thou∣sand
Quarters of Malt a Year for their Distille∣ry;
if I under-calculate it, the Gentlemen can
make an Allowance for that, upon all their own
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
Estimations; and I doubt not but I speak
much below the Quantity: But, I say, suppose
the <HI>Dutch</HI> take off for the Use of their Distil∣ling
Trade, one hundred thousand Quarters of
Malt from <HI>England</HI> every Year;<TABLE>

<P>This Encouragement, were there nothing
more in it, is very considerable; and gives
the <HI>Dutch</HI> a vast Advantage over our Distillers
here at home, who pay this whole Duty with∣out
any Draw-back, Bounty, or other Encou∣ragement
whatsoever; except it be, that they
also pay a heavy Duty upon the Spirits again,
after they are distill'd; instead of which, the
<HI>Dutch</HI> sending their Spirits hither, by the help
of another Fraud subsequent to all the rest,
have a Price for theirs superior to ours, and
pay no Duty at all; and whatever Duty is paid,
we pay it our selves, as we are the last Con∣sumers.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45"/>
But after we have considered the heavy
Weight of 32500<HI>l.</HI> upon every hundred thou∣sand
Quarter of Malt, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> take
off, and the Disadvantages which our Distillers
lie under upon this account, let us add to it,
what is mentioned <HI>p.</HI> 13. and undeniably made
out, namely, That the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or some∣body
for them, draw off from us just two
and thirty Thousand five hundred Pounds
Sterling more, upon every hundred Thousand
Quarter of Malt they take off, and which is
done by the mere Craft and Fraud of the Ex∣porter,
as has been said; which our Offices are
so supinely negligent in, as to pass upon them∣selves
for Law; or our Officers so well inte∣rested
in as to connive at. I do not pretend
to enquire, whether it is Ignorance or Cor∣ruption,
let the Gentlemen concern'd acquit
themselves of it as well as they can; it is equal
to the poor discourag'd Distillers, whether they
are oppress'd by one or the other; 'tis mani∣fest
they are oppress'd by it, be it which way
it will: 'tis the same thing, if my House be
fir'd, whether it were done by a <HI>Fool-Ser∣vant,</HI>
or a <HI>Rogue-Servant;</HI> the House is burnt,
and I feel the Loss, let it be done how it will.</P>
<P>Not but that it may come in my way in this
Debate, to say something of the probable Cau∣ses,
or at least the Encouragements of these
gross pieces of Fraud; and how a wise Nation,
as we are esteem'd to be, or at least think our
selves to be, should come to shut our Eyes so
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
apparently to our own Interest, as to lie open
to such Cheats as these are, and to be so abus'd
every Day; nay not to shut our Eyes to them,
but to be abus'd with our Eyes open, (for cer∣tainly
this can never be said to be a Secret)
if it has been practis'd so long, and never
seen before; we must have been as unhappy
in the Ignorance, as I think we are expos'd
in the Fraud of it.</P>
<P>But to return to the Point, about loading the
Distillers Trade with farther Weight: I would
humbly recommend to those Gentlemen who
have this Design under Consideration, if any are
so weak, that they would first consider of un∣loading
it; and then they may put it into a
Condition to bear any Hardships they shall
afterwards put upon it, with the greater Ease.</P>
<P>Let them unload it from the dead Weight,
which these clandestine Practices are not to
the Trade only, but to the whole Nation; for
in short, 'tis a Tax levied upon us, to give to
a set of clandestine Traders: whether they are
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> or <HI>Englishmen,</HI> or any Men, where
the Malt is ship'd for <HI>Holland,</HI> 'tis the same
thing, 'tis a National Grievance, and a Bur∣den
upon the Trade, which ought to be remo∣ved.</P>
<P>All
Inequality of Burthens, is a Prejudice
to the fair Trader; in the Sense of which
Maxim, it has always been the Care of our
Crown by an Equality of Burthens, to give
the fair Trader a due Advantage: Hence smug∣gling
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
and clandestine Trade, is on so many Ac∣counts
guarded against, and by so many Laws
made criminal among us, tho so impossible to
be fully prevented.</P>
<P>But here is a Law, which however good in
it self, and intended with the same just View,
is unhappily, and by the Craft of a set of Fo∣reigners,
perverted, the Point of it turn'd up∣on
the fair Traders; and the greatest clandes∣tine
Fraud that ever was, (of its kind) prac∣tised
in <HI>England,</HI> is set up by its Authority:
So that the Cheat is supported by the very
Law that was made to prevent it; may, it is
founded upon the very Execution of that Law
of Equality, on which Justice was to have
been expected.</P>
<P>Instead of an encouraging Draw-back, by
which the Consumption of our Growth was
supposed to be secur'd, and in order to which
the Exporter to have the Benefit of all; the
Duty that was paid being return'd to him, he
receives 4<HI>l. per</HI> Score in one Article more than
ever was paid, and 2<HI>l.</HI> 10<HI>s.</HI> in another, more
than ever was intended.</P>
<P>I have often heard it spoken of, with some
wonder, in <HI>England,</HI> how it came to pass, that
in some particular Places on the Coasts, the
Draw-back upon the Duty on Malt came to
more than the Duty it self; as was alledg'd
once likewise in the Affair of the <HI>Salt-Duty,</HI>
and by which, as I have been told, a gross
Abuse of the Publick afterwards was detected.
Whether it was so in the Salt or no, and how
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
it came about, is none of my Business: But
if it be so likewise in the Malt Draw-back, I
believe, upon a due Enquiry into the Reason
of it, some of these wicked Things might come
to light, and perhaps more than some People
are aware of.</P>
<P>But to reduce all this to the true End for
which all such Complaints ought to be made,
namely, the preventing the like; and suppo∣sing
it to be detected and prevented, as we hope
it may, what are we to enquire next?</P>
<P>The next Question is, How would this re∣form
the Abuses of the Distilling? My Answer
is direct, in two Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. You would then have no Abuses to cor∣rect
but our own; whereas now all the Cor∣ruptions
and Adulterations of Foreigners, are
put to our home-Account.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Distillers then being, as is said, again
secur'd and form'd into a Body, with due Pow∣ers
to act by, and sufficient Encouragement, are
able to answer for all Abuses of the Trade, that
is, they are able to answer that there should be
no Abuses committed, no unwholesom Liquors
distilled, or sold if they were distill'd.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This being the Case, there would be nothing
left for the Crown to be concern'd in, but to
prevent if they can, the Intemperance of the
People,</P>
<P>Nor would such a Regulation want its En∣couragement
even in the Nature of the thing;
there are many Ways to encrease the Revenue,
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
besides loading Trade with new Taxes. If this
particular Branch, clogg'd with Difficulties, and
oppress'd by Foreigners, Smuglers, and the
like, may be set free from those Oppressions
and Weights, giving it room to encrease,
encreases the Revenue of course; whereas
while it sinks under those Weights, adding Du∣tys
only serves to sink it deeper, and so even
lessens the Revenue which it paid before.</P>
<P>This was the Case exactly with the late high
Dutys upon Pepper; while those Dutys sub∣sisted,
the Revenue was devour'd, I think I may
say wholly devour'd, by the Draw-backs; and
all the Home-Consumption of Pepper was sup∣ply'd
by clandestine Trade, that is to say, by
Smuglers; whereas those high Duties being
again taken off, the Trade return'd into its
own Channel, and the Revenue reviv'd which
was sunk before.</P>
<P>Thus if the Distilling Trade should be
loaded with more Duties, while these Frauds
on the Foreign Trade still remain unredress'd,
what must be the Case but this, namely, The
Foreigners would have all the Business, and the
Distillers might put out their Fires and sit
still?</P>
<P>But I meet with another popular Objection
still, and it shews a little from what Quarter
all the rest has come. The Objection is this:</P>
<P>That the Distillers pay too small an Excise,
that they may pay a little higher Duty very
well, and that they do not pay an Equality
with the Brewer upon a Quarter of Malt.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50"/>
Now, tho this seems a little envious at best,
supposing we should grant the Suggestion, as
if the Brewer was uneasy that any Malt should
be consum'd but what should pay as great a
Duty as that which their own Trade pay;
yet as it happens not to be so in fact, it ex∣poses
the Objector so much the more, and
leaves us to guess (a little the plainer) whence
these Clamours at the Distillers had at least
some of their Original. I shall enquire into
the Particulars presently, but shall name ano∣ther
Objection of something a like nature along
with it.</P>
<P>It is also said, there is a sudden and great De∣cay
of the Brewing Trade in <HI>London;</HI> and this
too they would place to the account of the
Distilling Trade; as if the Distillers were rising
upon the Fall of the Brewers; all which are
mere groundless Jingles of a few designing
Men, who would deserve more regard if they
spoke truth, and as they are mistaken, de∣serve
indeed little or none at all.</P>
<P>It is true, we have not room here to give
a large and particular Answer to all these
Cavils; for such we hope to prove them to
be and no more. But yet we cannot close
this Tract without letting them know that we
have heard all they have to say upon these ma∣terial
Heads; which upon the whole, amounts
to but very little in Substance, tho much
perhaps in Noise and Pretences. The whole
may be briefly answer'd in the following Par∣ticulars,
reserving a more full and particular
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
Answer, as we may hereafter see occasion.
But to take them as they lie:</P>
<P N="1">1. It is so far from being true, that the
Distillers pay less Duty upon a Quarter of
Malt than the Brewer, that 'tis evident they
pay <HI>more.</HI> And not to enter at this time
into a Calculation of the Particulars, here not
being room for it, this we may undertake to
assert, namely, That the Distillers pay near
12<HI>s. per</HI> Quarter upon the Malt they use,
allowing a just proportion for its being not
drest down to the same Fineness, and con∣sequently
the same Measure as that of the
Brewers.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, the Brewers, the
Dressing of their Malt being likewise consi∣der'd,
do not pay above 8<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> on
each Quarter.</P>
<P>For let it be considered here what is observ'd
already in its place, and ought to have notice
taken of it on all occasions; namely, that for
the Double-Beer, Pale-Ales, Stout, and such
like Drinks, which the Brewers now run so
much upon, and in which they do not draw
near so great a length from a Quarter as in
the ordinary Brewing, they of course do not
pay so much to the Crown for the Excise;
nay, for these Liquors they may be said not
to pay six Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter on the Malt:
whereas the Distillers always extracting the
utmost Spirit the Malt will put forth, and
paying as much Duty for the meanest Malt
as the Brewer does for the best, has an infi∣nite
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
Disadvantage, and pays more for his Malt,
by how much the less Spirit he extracts from
it.</P>
<P>This, as above, will require a more full Ex∣planation,
and on occasion such an Explana∣tion
will not be wanting; but in the mean
time, those who make the Objection know
so much of the Truth of it, that they are
able to save us the Labour, and answer them∣selves,
tho at this time perhaps such generous
Treatment may not be for their Interest.</P>
<P>I go back then to the first Head, namely,
That there is a great and sudden Decay of the
Brewing Trade. My Answer is,</P>
<P N="1">1. There has been no apparent Decay of
the Brewing Trade, one Year with another, for
above four Years past, to last <HI>Midsummer;</HI> what
Decay has been must be since that time.</P>
<P N="2">2. By consequence then the great encrease
of the Consumption of Spirits in <HI>England</HI> has
not been the Cause of the Decay of the said
Brewing: for as that Encrease has been of three
or four Years continuance, why, if it decay'd
the Brewing Trade, was it never felt till since
<HI>Midsummer</HI> last?</P>
<P N="3">3. There has been no proportion'd Advance
upon the Distillery since <HI>Midsummer</HI> last;
why then should the Decay of one be occasion'd
by the other, which has not felt the Effect of
it? If the Distilling had encreas'd in propor∣tion
during that time, and that, so much more
than ever it had done before, then indeed the
Water of one Channel being found in the
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
Stream of another, would account for the
difference. But as that is not so in fact, the
Deficiency must be from some other more ap∣parent
Cause, and that we shall see presently.</P>
<P>The apparent Causes of the Decay or sud∣den
stop of the Brewing, so far as the Fact
may be granted, (for it is not so mighty in
Fact as in Noise) are these:</P>
<P N="1">1. The excessive Dearness of Hops the last
Season, which was so heavy a Rent-Charge
upon the Brewer, that it really put a check
to their whole Business; and some of them
found it hard to furnish themselves with a
suitable Stock upon any Terms whatever: That
Difficulty has of course caused them to lessen
the Quantity of Beer among their Customers,
as much as they could, when they came to
lay in their Stores.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Dearness of Malt it self, which by
the universal Badness of the Season in all the
Malting Counties, has had an effect upon the
Malt as well as upon other Grain; this has both
lessen'd the Quantity and advanc'd the Price,
so that Malt in particular has been 5 to 6<HI>s.
per</HI> Quarter dearer this Year than it was the
last. These things have been so apparent,
and here so well known to other People as
well as to the Brewers themselves, that 'tis
something strange they should lay themselves
open to so effectual a Reply.</P>
<P>But this too will appear less strange when
we shall add, that the K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ery of the Brewers
themselves, to say no worse of it, may have
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
some share in the Reasons for a sudden Decay
of their Trade; especially if it be true that they
have come into that bare-fac'd piece of Policy,
<HI>viz.</HI> To strike their Work in order to lessen
the Excise, and so make a joint Clamour for
promoting the Design. But of this we may
say more in its proper Place.</P>
<P>But now, to put in a Word for the Poor, as
well as for the Trade, and so to close this Dis∣course;
you must allow me to say, that were
it so that they had quite forsaken the drinking
Beer and Ale, and were wholly come in∣to
the drinking of Spirits, Brandy, Geneva,
or what you please; it seems to me they have
done not only that which their Ancestors did
before them, but even what their Superiors
have seem'd to lead them into just now, by a
general Example. As follows.</P>
<P>There has been for some Years, and still
continues among us. a national Gust or Inclina∣tion
to drinking stronger and highe pric'd Li∣quors
than formerly; I do not say we drink
more, or more to Excess, that is a Subject of
another Nature, and however true, is not to
my present Purpose. But the Stream of the
Nation's Palate runs, I say, for stronger and
dearer Liquors. Let me begin at the Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ladys</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of Quality and
Distinction, not content with the usual, and
as I have said above, most wholesom Dram,
call'd right <HI>French</HI> Brandy, now treat with
<HI>Ratafia</HI> and <HI>Citron,</HI> at a Guinea a Bottle.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="55"/>
The <HI>Punch Drinkers</HI> of Quality, (if any
such there be) not contented with the best
<HI>French</HI> Brandy in their Bowls, must have <HI>Ar∣rack</HI>
at 16<HI>s.</HI> to 18<HI>s. per</HI> Gallon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wine Drinkers</HI> of the better sort, not
content with the <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Barcelona</HI>
Wines, must have high Country <HI>Morgeau,
O Brian</HI> and <HI>Hermitage</HI> Clarets, at 5<HI>s.</HI> to
6. <HI>per</HI> Bottle; and after that <HI>Champagn</HI> and
<HI>Burgundy</HI> at 7<HI>s.</HI> to 8<HI>s. per</HI> Bottle.</P>
<P>The common <HI>Draft</HI> of Red Wine of <HI>Opor∣to</HI>
and <HI>Viana,</HI> tho all stronger than the <HI>French</HI>
Wines formerly drank, is not now strong e∣nough
for the <HI>Citizens;</HI> but they must be
<HI>made up</HI> (so the Wine-Brewers call it) with
<HI>Lisbons,</HI> with <HI>Alicants,</HI> and <HI>Bene-Carloes:</HI>
and the <HI>Oporto</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> Whites, tho very
strong, are turn'd out of Doors, for the yet
stronger <HI>Mountain Malaga.</HI></P>
<P>To descend still lower: Our common Drink∣ers
of <HI>Ale</HI> or <HI>Beer,</HI> are not contented as for∣merly,
with the ordinary <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Beer,</HI> or
Porters <HI>Ale;</HI> but they are advanced, first to
<HI>Two-penny,</HI> then to <HI>double-Beer,</HI> and <HI>Stout;</HI>
and now to the strongest North-Country <HI>Bur∣ton,</HI>
and <HI>Tamworth Pale Ale; Dorchester</HI> and
<HI>Newbury Beers,</HI> and the like; of which
great Quantitys are brought up by Land Car∣riage,
above 100 Miles, and for which, above
300 small-Brew-houses, have, as I am told,
been erected within these few Years, in the City
and the adjacent Parts; which Ales are sold
from 6<HI>d.</HI> to 10<HI>d. per</HI> Quart.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="56"/>
In like manner then, the Poor following
this unhappy Humour of the Rich, and find∣ing
themselves as willing to gratify their Palate,
only not equally able to bear the Expence, are
fallen into the old Dram-drinking Way, which
their Fathers practis'd before them; and which,
as it is easy to their Pockets, spends less of
their Time; and unless they please, no more
prompts their Excesses, than the <HI>Beer</HI> and the
<HI>Ale</HI> did before; and if I may give my Opi∣nion,
I think indeed not so much. And thus
I have brought down the History to our pre∣sent
Times.</P>
<P>I shall close this Tract, which is already
swell'd to a larger Bulk than was intended,
with a few very short Hints at the Disadvan∣tage
which the Distillers at present are under in
the Course of their Trade, and which they hope
to be deliver'd from, by the Justice of the
Parliament, and the Encouragements which
they have reason to hope for and expect.</P>
<P>Some of the Disadvantages they are under,
are as follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. That whereas all the Malt exported to
<HI>Holland,</HI> and from which the <HI>Dutch</HI> extract
the Spirits which they import upon us, draws
back the whole Duty, besides a Bounty of
2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Quarter to the Exporter (not to
speak of the Fraud mentioned above, and
which doubles both the Draw-back and the
Bounty) yet our own distill'd Spirit upon Ex∣portation
draws back but 4<HI>l.</HI> 4<HI>s. per</HI> Tun of
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
the Excise paid, and nothing at all of the Malt
Duty.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Dutch</HI> are enabled exceedingly to
under-work and under-sell the <HI>English</HI> Distiller
(even by our selves) and at the Expence of
our own Crown, whom they so many ways in∣jure
in the said Allowances.</P>
<P N="2">2. That by the Advantages given to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> for the importing Brandy 2<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI>
Gallon Duty less than the <HI>French,</HI> which Du∣tys
are also paid by the Importers, not by the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> they have an unrestrain'd Liberty of
imposing their Mixtures upon us, of a baser
Kind; which Mixtures, because they appa∣rently
come from abroad, and are called Bran∣dy
at the Custom-house, our People are easily
persuaded to take for true Brandy, whereas it
is very well known, that many times it is in∣ferior
to our common Malt Spirits, and our
Distillers affirm, they are able to out-do even
the best of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> by the like Artifice, come in∣to
our Rivers and Ports, or at least into the
open Roads where our Ships ride, as in <HI>Yar∣mouth</HI>
Roads, the <HI>Downs, St. Helens,</HI> and
even into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> up to the
<HI>Nore</HI> and the <HI>Hope,</HI> and there supply our out∣ward-bound
Ships with their Spirits, or Brandys
(as they call them) not only for the said
Ship's use, but also in Quantities for Trade;
for all which no Entry is made, or any Duty
at all paid: So that our <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>East-In∣dia</HI>
Ships in particular, which used to take
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
in large Quantities of Liquors of our Distillers,
go away now with little or no Stores, de∣pending
to be supply'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the
<HI>Downs</HI> and other Places.</P>
<P>These are all great Obstructions to the Dis∣tilling
Trade; and as they are withal great A∣buses
upon the fair Traders in general, and in∣jurious
to the Crown in particular, we cannot
doubt, but if fairly represented, the Distil∣lers
shall have such Relief, as in right and
justice they ought to expect.</P>
<P>Besides these apparent Discouragements in
favour of Foreigners, and in favour of clandes∣tine
Trade, they are unjustly attack'd with
Clamours and popular Pretences, as if their
Trade was a publick Nusance, and ought to
be regulated by the Magistrates; suggesting,
that their Liquors are unwholesom, and destruc∣tive,
Incentives to Vice, and tempting to the
Poor, to the Waste of their Health, Money,
Time and Understandings; Things which tho
not worth replying to, their apparent Partiali∣ty
being sufficiently already exposed, and as
all the Excesses of the People, either in these
Liquors or any other are founded in their own
Intemperance; the Distillers say, if they may
obtain such Powers and just Authority, which as
a Company they once had, and still ought to
have, and which other Companys in Cases less
essential to the Health of the People now have,
so as they may be able to inspect and regulate
the Trade as it ought to be regulated, they
would answer to the World for the Wholesom∣ness
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
of the Liquors they extract, and appeal to
the Understanding and Sense of the most experi∣enc'd
Physicians, if unprejudic'd.</P>
<P>As for the learned and worthy Physician,
who, if Report lyes not, is to be employ'd to
show to the World the pernicious Consequence
of drinking <HI>Geneva</HI> or Malt Spirits, and how
many Thousands it has slain, we impatiently
wait his elaborate Performance; and to help
it forward, only beg he will not omit to prove
also, the few needful Particulars following.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Malt Spirits made in <HI>England</HI>
are much more pernicious than those made
in <HI>Holland</HI> and sent over hither, tho made
all from the same Materials.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Liquor call'd <HI>Geneva</HI> is mortal
in it self, and that the Juniper-Berries put into
it are Poison.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it is the Liquor it self, not the im∣moderate
Use or Excess of it, that does the
Mischief.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That 'tis much better to be drunk with
Strong-Beer and Pale-Ales brew'd from Malt,
than with Spirits extracted from the same Malt,
tho it is the Spirit alone in the Beer and Ale
that intoxicates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That Drunkenness by Ale and Beer, de∣stroys
no Health, wastes no Time, spends no
Money, weakens no Understandings; and that
it is only the <HI>Geneva</HI> that does such wicked
Things as those.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That there are more People drunk with
<HI>Geneva</HI> than with Ale and Beer, and that
a poor Man can be drunk for a Half-penny.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="52" REF="60"/>
7. And lastly, to clench it all, Let him
prove that more People die of drinking <HI>Gene∣va,</HI>
than die of the <HI>Doctor;</HI> not failing to tell
to the World, where that formidable <HI>Geneva</HI>
Shop stands, that has slain more Christians than
himself.</ITEM>
