<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Faction now having lost all
Hopes of Success by their unnatural
Rebellion, they apply themselves
with the utmost Industry and Malice
to cry down the Proceedings of Ju∣stice
against the Rebels who are taken, as Barba∣rous
and cruel, and having no Precedent in Hi∣story.
This Clamour is so very ill founded, and
so remote from Truth, that it might be justly
thought needless to give it any Answer; but
since it is made use of by the Party farther to in∣cense
the ignorant Mob against the Government,
it can't be thought amiss to convict our Adversa∣ries
of Falshood, by putting them in mind of the
barbarous Cruelty of the late King <HI>James</HI> II. a∣gainst
those who took Arms under the Duke of
<HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>;
and likewise of that Prince's Barbarity to the
Protestants in <HI>Ireland,</HI> after the Revolution.</P>
<P>These Things are still remember'd by Thou∣sands
of Eye-Witnesses, and therefore can admit
of no Contradiction, but from such as have bid
Defiance to Truth, because they know the Inte∣rest
of Tyranny and Popery, which they espouse,
can never be supported by any other Methods
than Cruelty and Falshood.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
I shall begin with the Proceedings in that
King's Reign against those who took Arms in
the West of <HI>England</HI> under the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI>
The Lists of those who were executed, or other∣wise
punish'd on that Account, are in the follow∣ing
Treatise, and more large and exact than
what has yet been published; so that I shall say
nothing of them here, but proceed to give some
Account of the Difference betwixt that and the
present Rebellion.</P>
<P>Every one knows, that those who join'd the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> did not do it till after King
<HI>James</HI> II. had declared himself a Papist, and con∣trary
to Law encourag'd those of his own Per∣swasion
to set up their Worship publickly; and
he had likewise in an arbitrary and tyrannical
Manner invaded our Civil Liberties, as may be
seen by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Declaration, and
that of the Earl of <HI>Argyle.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The DECLARATION of <HI>James</HI>
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the No∣blemen,
Gentlemen, and others,
now in Arms for the Defence and
Vindication of the <HI>Protestant Reli∣gion,</HI>
and the <HI>Laws, Rights,</HI> and
<HI>Privileges</HI> of England.</HEAD>
<P>' AS Government was originally instituted
by God, and this or that Form of it
chosen and submitted to by Men, for the Peace,
Happiness, and Security of the Governed, and
not for the private Interest, and personal
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Greatness of those that rule; so that Govern∣ment
hath always been esteemed the best, where
the Supreme Magistrates have been invested
with all the Power and Prerogatives that might
capacitate them, not only to preserve the Peo∣ple
from Violence and Oppression, but to pro∣mote
their Prosperity; and yet, where no∣thing
was to belong to them by the Rules of
the Constitution, that might enable them to
injure and oppress them. And it hath been the
Glory of <HI>England,</HI> above most other Nations,
that the Prince had all entrusted with him that
was necessary, either for the advancing the
Welfare of the People, or for his own Prote∣ction
in the Discharge of the Office; and withal
stood so limited and restrained by the Funda∣mental
Terms of the Constitution, that with∣out
a Violation of his own Oath, as well as the
Rules and Measures of the Government, he
could do them no Hurt, nor exercise any Act of
Authority, but through the Administration of
such Hands as stood obnoxious to be punished
in case they transgressed: So that according to
the primitive Frame of the Government, the
Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Privileges
of the Subject, are so far from jostling one a∣nother,
that the Rights reserved unto the Peo∣ple
tended to render the King Honourable and
Great, and the Prerogatives settled on the
Prince were in order to the Subjects Protection
and Safety. But all Human Things being sub∣ject
to Perversion, as well as Decay, it hath
been the Fate of the <HI>English</HI> Government to be
often changed, and wrested from what it was
in the first Settlement and Institution. And
we are particularly compelled to say, that all
the Boundaries of the Government have of late
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
been broken, and nothing less unattempted for
turning our limited Monarchy into an absolute
Tyranny: For such hath been the Transaction
of Affairs within this Nation for several Years
last past, that though the Protestant Religion
and Liberties of the People were fenced and
hedged about by as many Laws, as the Wisdom
of Man can devise for their Preservation against
Popery and Arbitrary Power, our Religion
hath been all along countermined by popish
Counsels, and our Privileges ravished from us
by Fraud and Violence. And more especially
the whole Course and Series of the Life of the
<HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Y.</HI> hath been but one continued Conspi∣racy
against the Reformed Religion, and the
Rights of the Nation: For, whoever considers
his contriving the burning of <HI>London,</HI> his insti∣gating
a Confederacy with <HI>France,</HI> and a War
with <HI>Holland,</HI> fomenting the Popish Plot, and
encouraging the Murther of Sir <HI>Ed. Godfrey,</HI>
his charging Treason against Protestants, sub∣orning
Witnesses to swear the Patriots of our
Religion and Liberties out of their Lives; his
hiring execrable Villains to assassinate the late
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> and causing those others to be
clandestinely cut off in Hopes to conceal it;
his advising and procuring the Prorogation and
Dissolution of Parliaments, in order to prevent
their looking into his Crimes, and that he might
escape the Justice of the Nation; such can i∣magine
nothing so black and horrid in it self,
or so ruinous and destructive to Religion and
the Kingdom, which we may not expect from
him.'</P>
<P>' The very Tyrannies which he hath exerci∣sed
since he snatched the Crown from his Bro∣ther's
Head, do leave none under a Possibility
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
of flattering themselves with Hopes of Safety,
either in their Consciences, Persons, or E∣states:
For, in Defiance of all the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm, made for the Security
of the Reformed Protestant Religion, he not
only began his Reign with a bare-fac'd Avow∣ing
himself of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, but call'd in
Multitudes of Priests and Jesuits, for whom the
Law makes it Treason to come into this King∣dom;
and hath impower'd them to exercise I∣dolatries:
And besides his being daily present
at the Worship of the Mass, he hath publickly
assisted at the greatest Fopperies of their Su∣perstition.
Neither hath he been more tender
in trampling upon the Laws which concern
our Properties, seeing in two Proclamations,
whereof the one requires the collecting of the
Customs, and the other the continuing that
part of the Excise which was to expire at the
late King's Death; he hath violently, and a∣gainst
all the Law of the Land, broken in up∣on
our Estates. Neither is it any Extenuation
of his Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it
by an extrajudicial Opinion of seven or eight
suborned and forsworn Judges; but rather de∣claring
the Greatness and Extent of the Conspi∣racy
against our Rights; and that there is no
Means left for our Relief, but by Force of
Arms: For, advancing those to the Bench that
were the Scandal of the Bar; and constituting
those very Men to declare the Laws, who are ac∣cused
and branded in Parliament for pervert∣ing
them, we were precluded all Hopes of Ju∣stice
in <HI>Westminster-Hall:</HI> And by packing Ju∣ries
together by false Returns, new illegal
Charters, and other corrupt Means, he doth at
once deprive us of all Expectations of Succour
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
where our Ancestors were wont to find it; and
hopes to render that which ought to be the
People's Fences against Tyranny, and the Con∣servator
of their Liberties, the Means of sub∣verting
all our Laws, and of establishing of his
Arbitrariness, and confirming our Thraldom.
So that unless we could be contented to see the
Reformed Protestant Religion, and such as
profess it, extirpated, Popish Superstition and
Idolatry establish'd, the Laws of the Land
trampled under Foot, the Liberties and Rights
of the <HI>English</HI> People subverted, and all that is
Sacred and Civil, or of Regard amongst Men of
Virtue or Piety, violated; and unless we could
be willing to be Slaves as well as Papists, and
forget the Example of our Noble and Generous
Ancestors, who conveyed our Privileges to us
at the Expence of their Blood and Treasure;
and withal, be unmindful of our Duty to God,
our Country and Posterity; deaf to the Cries
and Groans of our oppressed Friends, and be
satisfied not only to see them and our selves
imprison'd, robb'd, and murdered, but the Pro∣testant
Interest throughout the whole World,
betrayed to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI>; we are bound, as
Men and Christians, and that in Discharge of
our Duty to God, and our Country, and for
the Satisfaction of the Protestant Nations round
about us, to betake our selves to Arms; which
we take Heaven and Earth to witness, we
should not have done, had not the Malice of
our Enemies deprived us of all other Means of
Redress; and were not the Miseries that we al∣ready
feel, and those which do further threaten
us, worse than the Calamities of War. And it
is not for any personal Injuries, or private Dis∣contents,
nor in pursuance of any corrupt In∣terest,
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
that we take our Swords in our Hands;
but for vindicating our Religion, Laws and
Rights, and rescuing our Country from Ruin
and Destruction, and for the preserving our
selves, Wives and Children, from Bondage and
Idolatry. Wherefore, before God, Angels and
Men, we stand acquitted from, and do charge
upon our Enemies, all the Slaughter and De∣vastations
that unavoidably accompany inte∣stine
War.'</P>
<P>' Now, therefore, we do hereby solemnly de∣clare
and proclaim War against <HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI> as
a Murderer, and an Assassin of innocent Men,
a Traytor to the Nation, and a Tyrant over
the People: And we would have none that ap∣pear
under his Banner to flatter themselves with
Expectation of Forgiveness, it being our firm
Resolution to prosecute him, and his Adhe∣rents,
without giving Way to Treaties and Ac∣commodations,
until we have brought him
and them to undergo what the Rule of the
Constitution, and the Statutes of the Realm,
as well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture, and
Nations, adjudge to be Punishment due to the
Enemies of God, Mankind, their Country, and
all Things that are Honourable, Virtuous, and
Good.'</P>
<P>' And though we cannot avoid being sensible
that too many have, from Cowardise, Cove∣tousness
and Ambition, co-operated to the
subverting of our Religion, and enslaving their
Country; yet we would have none, from a
Despair of finding Mercy, persevere in their
Crimes, nor continue the Ruin of the King∣dom:
For we exclude none from the Benefit
of Repentance, that will join with us in retrie∣ving
that they have been accessary to the Loss
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
of: Nor do we design Revenge upon any, but
the obstinate, and such as shall be found at this
Juncture yielding Aid and Assistance to the said
<HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI>'</P>
<P>' And that we may both govern our selves in
the Pursuit of this glorious Cause wherein we
are engaged, and give Encouragement to all
that shall assist us in so righteous and necessary
an Undertaking, we do, in the Presence of the
Lord, who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts,
and is the Avenger of Deceit and Falshood,
proclaim and publish what we aim at; and for
the obtaining whereof, we have both determi∣ned
to venture, and are ready to lay down our
Lives. And though we are not come into the
Field to introduce Anarchy and Confusion, or
for laying aside any Part of the Old <HI>English</HI> Go∣vernment,
yet our Purposes and Resolutions
are, to reduce Things to that Temperament
and Ballance, that future Rulers may remain
able to do all the Good that can be either desi∣red
or expected from them: and that it may
not be in their Power to invade the Rights, and
infringe the Liberties of the People.'</P>
<P>' And whereas our Religion, the most valua∣ble
thing we lay claim unto, hath been shaken
by unjust Laws, undermined by Popish Coun∣sels,
and is now in Danger to be subverted, we
are therefore resolved to spend our Blood for
preserving it to our selves and Posterity: Nor
will we lay down our Arms till we see it esta∣blished
and secured beyond all Probability of
being supplanted and overthrown, and until
all the Penal Laws against all Protestant
Dissenters be repealed, and legal Provision
made against their being disturbed, by reason
of their Consciences, and for their enjoying
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
an equal Liberty with other Protestants.'</P>
<P>' And that the Meekness and Purity of our
Principles, and the Moderation and Righte∣ousness
of our End may appear unto all Men,
we do declare, That we will not make War up∣on
or destroy any for their Religion, how
false and erroneous soever: So that the very
Papists, provided they withdraw from the
Tents of our Enemies, and be not found Guil∣ty
of conspiring our Destruction, or Abettors
of them that seek it, have nothing to fear or
apprehend from us, except what may hinder
their altering our Laws, and endangering our
Persons in the Profession of the Reformed Do∣ctrine,
and Exercise of our Christian Worship.'</P>
<P>' Our Resolution in the next Place is, To
maintain all the just Rights and Privileges of
Parliament, and to have Parliaments annually
chosen and held, and not prorogued, dissolved,
or discontinued within the Year, before Peti∣tions
be first answered, and Grievances redres∣sed.'</P>
<P>' And seeing many of the Miseries under
which the Nation doth groan, arise from dis∣placing
such out of the Number of Judges as
would not, for the promoting Popish and Ar∣bitrary
Designs, wrest and misapply the Laws,
and from constituting Corrupt and Mercenary
Men in their Rooms, on purpose to stretch the
Laws beyond the Reason and Intention of them;
and to declare that for Law which is not; we
can neither with Silence pass over the mention∣ing
of them; nor should we have Peace in our
selves, if we did not endeavour to prevent the
like Mischief in Time to come. For by Reason
of ill Men's being advanced to the Bench, and
holding their Places only <HI>durante bene placito,</HI>
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
many Persons have been condemned in exorbi∣tant
Fines for no Crimes, or for very small
ones: Many Statutes made for the Safety of the
Subject, particularly the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act,
have been wickedly eluded, to the Oppression
of the Innocent and Loyal Men. The Popish
Lords that were impeached in Parliament for
a most hellish Conspiracy, have, to the sub∣verting
the Rights of the House of Lords, been
discharged, and set free. The imposing a
Mayor and Sheriffs upon the City of <HI>London,</HI>
by Fraud and Violence, have been justified,
and those who in discharge of their Duty op∣posed
it, illegally prosecuted, and arbitrarily
punished. <HI>London,</HI> and other Cities and Cor∣porations,
have been robbed of their Char∣ters,
upon unrighteous Judgments of pretended
Forfeitures. Sir <HI>Thomas Armstrong</HI> executed
without being allowed the Benefit of a Tryal.
Colonel <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> condemn'd to die up∣on
the Deposition of one scandalous Witness.
And that Loyal and Excellent Person, the late
<HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Russel,</HI> murthered for alledged
Crimes; in reference to which, if all had been
true which was sworn against him, yet there
was nothing which according to Law could
have reached his Life. Upon the Considera∣tions
aforesaid, we further declare, that we will
have Care taken for the future, for the debar∣ring
ignorant, scandalous, and mercenary Men
from the Administration of Justice; and that
the Judges shall hold their Places by the anci∣ent
Tenure of <HI>quam diu se bene gesserint</HI>; and to
leave it to the Wisdom of a Parliament, to set∣tle
some Way and Method for the Approbation
of such as shall be advanced to the Degree and
Dignity of Judges.'</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
' And forasmuch as the Invasion made on the
Right of Cities, Burroughs, and Towns Cor∣porate;
the Seisure of their Charters, whether
by Surrender, or upon pretence of Forfeiture,
have been wholly arbitrary and illegal; we
likewise therefore declare, we will, to our ut∣most,
endeavour to see them repossessed in what
they formerly had, and could legally lay claim
to; and that we do esteem all Judgments given
against them, and all Surrenders made by a cor∣rupt
and perjured Party amongst them, null and
void in Law; and do hold and declare their
old Charters, notwithstanding the new ones
lately granted, to be good and valid: And ac∣cordingly
we do invite and encourage all ho∣nest
Burgesses and Free-men to re-assume the
Rights and Privileges, which by Virtue of the
said old Charters, belonged to their several and
respective Corporations; and to deliver them∣selves
from those late Parasites, and Instru∣ments
of Tyranny set up to oppress them.'</P>
<P>' Moreover, for the restoring the Kingdom to
its Primitive Condition of Freedom and Safety,
we will have the <HI>Corporation</HI> and <HI>Militia Acts</HI>
repealed: And all Outlawries of Treason against
any Person whatsoever, upon the late pretend∣ed
Portestant Plot, reversed; and also, all other
Outlawries, Banishments, Warrants, Judg∣ments,
Imprisonments, and injurious Proceed∣ings
against any other Persons, upon any of
the Penal Statutes made against Protestant Dis∣senters,
made null and void. And we will
have new Laws enacted for placing the Electi∣on
of Sheriffs in the Freeholders of the several
Countries, for settling the Militia in the several
Shires, and for preventing all Military standing
Forces, except what shall be raised and kept up
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
by Authority and Consent of Parliament.'</P>
<P>' And whereas several Gentlemen and others,
who have been worthy and zealous Assertors
of the Protestant Interest, and Laws of the
Kingdom, are now in Custody in divers Places
within the Realm, upon most unjust Accusati∣ons,
Pretences, Proceedings and Judgments;
we do hereby further declare the said Imprison∣ments
to be illegal; and that in case any Vio∣lence
shall be offered to them, or any of them,
we will revenge it to the utmost upon such of
our Enemies as shall fall into our Hands.'</P>
<P>' And whereas the said <HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI> in order to
the expenditing the Idolatrous and Bloody De∣signs
of the Papists, the gratifying his own
boundless Ambition after a Crown, and to hin∣der
Enquiry into the Assassination of <HI>Arthur</HI>
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> hath poyson'd the late King, and
thereby manifested his Ingratitude, as well as
Cruelty to the World, in murthering a Brother
who had almost ruin'd himself to preserve and
protect him from Punishment; We do there∣fore
further declare, That for the aforesaid
villanous and unnatural Crime, and other his
Crimes before mentioned, and in pursuance of
the Resolution of both House of Parliament,
who voted to revenge the King's Death, in
case he came to an <HI>untimely End,</HI> we will prose∣cute
the said <HI>J.</HI> D. of <HI>Y.</HI> till we have brought
him to suffer what the Law adjudged to be
the Punishment of so execrable a Fact.'</P>
<P>' And in a more particular manner, His Grace
the Duke of <HI>Manmouth,</HI> being sensible of the
barbarous and horried Parricide committed upon
his Father, doth resolve to pursue the said <HI>J.</HI>
D. of <HI>Y.</HI> as a mortal and bloody Enemy; and
will endeavour, as well with his own Hand, as
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
by the Assistance of his Friends, and the Law,
to have Justice executed upon him.'</P>
<P>' And the said <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the
now Head and Captain-General of the Prote∣stant
Forces in this Kingdom, assembled for the
End aforesaid, from the Generousness of his
own Nature, and the Love he bears to these
Nations, whose Welfare and Settlement he in∣finitely
prefers to whatsoever concerns himself,
doth not at present insist upon his Title, but
leaves the Determination thereof to the Wis∣dom,
Justice, and Authority of a Parliament
legally chosen, and acting with Freedom;
and in the mean time doth profess and declare,
by all that is sacred, That he will, in Conjun∣ction
with the People of <HI>England,</HI> employ all
the Abilities bestowed upon him by God and
Nature, for the Re-establishment and Preserva∣tion
of the Protestant Reformed Religion in
these Kingdoms, and for restoring the Subjects
of the same to a free Exercise thereof, in Op∣position
to Popery, and the Consequences of it,
Tyranny and Slavery. To the obtaining of
which End, he doth hereby Promise and Ob∣lige
himself to the People of <HI>England,</HI> to con∣sent
unto, and promote the passing into Laws
all the Methods aforesaid; that it may never
more be in the Power of any single Person on
the Throne, to deprive their Subjects of their
Rights, and to subvert the Fundamental Laws of
the Government design'd for their Preservation.'</P>
<P>' And whereas the Nobility and Gentry, and
Commons of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are now in Arms upon the
like Motives and Inducements that we are, and in
Prosecution of Ends agreeable with ours, we do
therefore approve the Justice of their Cause, com∣mend
their Zeal and Courage, expecting their,
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
and promising our Assistance, for carrying on
that Glorious Work we are jointly engaged in;
being obliged, avoiding Tediousness, to omit the
recounting many Oppressions under which that
Kingdom hath groaned, and the giving a De∣duction
of the several Steps that have been ta∣ken
for introducing of Popery and Tyranny. We
think fit, therefore, to signifie both to our Coun∣try-men
and Foreigners, that we intend a larger
Testimony and Remonstrance of the Grievances,
Persecutions, Cruelties and Tyrannies, we have
of late lain under; and therein a full and more
particular Account of the unparallel'd Crimes
of the D. of <HI>Y.</HI> And we make our Appeal unto
GOD, and all Protestant Kings, Princes, States,
and People, concerning the Justice of our Cause,
and the Necessity we are reduced unto of ha∣ving
our Recourse to Arms. And as we do be∣seech,
require and adjure all sincere Protestants,
and true <HI>English</HI> Men, to be assisting to us against
the Enemies of the Gospel, Rights of the Na∣tion,
and Liberties of Mankind; so we are con∣fident
of obtaining the utmost Aid and Succour
which they can yield us with their Prayers,
Persons, and Estates, for the dethroning the
said Tyrant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nor do we doubt being justi∣fied,
countenanced, and assisted by all Prote∣stant
Kings, Princes, and Common-wealths,
who either regard the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
or their own Interest. And above all, our De∣pendance
and Trust is upon the Lord of Hosts,
in whose Name we go forth, and to whom we
commit our Cause, and refer the Decision be∣twixt
us and our Enemies in the Day of Battle.
<HI>Now let us play the Men for our People, and for
the Cities of our GOD; and the Lord do that
which seemeth good unto him.</HI>'</P>

having taken off his Mask, and abandoned and
invaded our Religion and Liberties, resolving
to enter into the Government, and exercising
it contrary to Law, I think it not only just,
but my Duty to God and my Country, to use
my utmost Endeavours to oppose and redress
his Usurpations and Tyranny.'</P>
<P>' And therefore being assisted and furnished
very nobly by several good Protestants, and in∣vited
and accompanied by several of both Na∣tions
to lead them, I resolve, as God shall ena∣ble
me, to use their Assistance of all Kinds,
towards the Ends exprest in the said <HI>Declaration.</HI>'</P>
<P>' And I do hereby earnestly Invite and Obtest
all honest Protestants, and particularly all my
Friends, and Blood Relations, to concur with
us in the said <HI>Declaration</HI>; and as I have writ∣ten
several Letters, so having no other Way
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
fully to intimate my Mind otherwise, I do
hereby require all my Vassals any where, and
all within my several Jurisdictions, with their
fencible Men within their Command, to go to
Arms, and to join and concur with us accord∣ing
to the said <HI>Declaration,</HI> as they shall be an∣swerable
at their Peril; and that they obey
the particular Orders they shall receive from
me, from Time to come.'</P>

<P>By these 'tis plain that those unfortunate Lords,
and others who join'd them, took up Arms in
Defence of our Religion and Liberties, which
were then invaded, and as it afterwards appear'd,
were design'd to be totally subverted.</P>
<P>But the present Rebellion is rais'd in Oppositi∣on
to our Laws for maintaining the Protestant
Succession, and British Liberties, which <HI>James</HI> II.
had destroy'd as far as he cou'd, and wou'd in all
Probability have compleated the Ruin of them,
had not God by a wonderful Turn of Providence
spirited the Nations to call in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
to their Rescue. Nor would the Pretender have
fail'd to prosecute the same wicked Designs
which had been set on Foot by his supposed Fa∣ther;
as will appear by his Declaration publish'd
at <HI>Perth,</HI> as follows;</P>

<SALUTE>to all Our Loving Sub∣jects,

<P>As we are firmly resolved never to lose
any Opportunity of asserting Our undoubted
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
Title to the Imperial Crown of these Realms,
and of endeavouring to get the Possession of
that Right which is devolved upon Us by the
Laws of God and Man; so must We, in Justice
to the Sentiments of Our own Heart, declare,
That nothing in the World can give Us so great
Satisfaction, as to owe to the Endeavours of
Our Loyal Subjects both Our own and their
Restoration to that happy Settlement which
can alone deliver this Church and Nation from
the Calamities which they lie at present under,
and from these future Miseries which must be
the Consequences of the present Usurpation.
During the Life of Our dear Sister, of Glorious
Memory, the Happiness which our People
enjoyed, softened, in some Degree, the Hard∣ship
of our own Fate; and we must further
confess that when we reflected on the Good∣ness
of her Nature, and her Inclination to Ju∣stice,
We could not but perswade Our self, that
she intended to establish and perpetuate the
Peace which she had given to these Kingdoms,
by destroying for ever all Competition to the
Succession of the Crown, and by consenting
to us, at last, the Enjoyment of that Inheri∣tance
out of which we had been so long kept,
which her Conscience must inform Her was our
Due, and which her Principles must lead her
to desire, that We might obtain. But since the
Time, it pleased God to put a Period to her
Life, and not to suffer Us to throw Our self,
as We then firmly purposed to have done, upon
Our People; We have not been able to look
upon the present Condition of Our Kingdoms,
or to consider their future Prospect, without all
the Horror and Indignation which ought to
fill the Breast of every <HI>Scotsman.</HI> We have be∣held
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
a Foreign Family, Aliens to our Country,
distant in Blood, and Strangers even to our
Language, ascend the Throne. We have seen
the Reins of Government put into the Hands of
a Faction, and that Authority which was de∣sign'd
for the Protection of all, exercised by a
few of the worst, to the Oppression of the
best and greatest Number of Our Subjects.
Our Sister has not been left at Rest in her
Grave, her Name has been scurrilously abused,
her Glory, as far as in these People lay, inso∣lently
defaced, and her faithful Servants inhu∣manly
persecuted. A Parliament has been pro∣cured
by the most unwarrantable Influences,
and by the grossest Corruptions to serve the
vilest Ends, and they, who ought to be the
Guardians of the Liberties of the People, are
become the Instruments of Tyranny: Whilst
the principal Powers engaged in the late Wars,
do enjoy the Blessings of Peace, and are atten∣tive
to discharge their Debts, and ease their
People; <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in the midst of Peace,
feels all the Load of War. New Debts are
contracted, new Armies are raised at Home,
<HI>Dutch</HI> Forces are brought into these King∣doms,
and by taking Possession of the Dutchy
of <HI>Bremen,</HI> in Violation of the Publick Faith,
a Door is opened by the Usurper, to let in an
Inundation of Foreigners from abroad, and to
reduce these Nations to the State of a Province,
to one of the most inconsiderable Provinces of
the Empire.'</P>
<P>' These are some few of the many real Evils
into which these Kingdoms have been betray∣ed,
under Pretence of being rescued and se∣cured
from Dangers purely imaginary; and
these are such Consequences of abandoning
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>
the old Constitution, as we perswade Our selves
very many of those who promoted the present
unjust and illegal Settlement never intended.'</P>
<P>' We observe, with the utmost Satisfaction,
that the Generality of Our Subjects are awa∣ken'd
with a just Sense of their Danger, and
that they shew themselves resolv'd to take such
Measures as may effectually rescue them from
that Bondage which has, by the Artifice of a
few designing Men, and the Concurrence of ma∣ny
unhappy Causes, been brought upon them.'</P>
<P>' We adore the Wisdom of Divine Provi∣dence,
which has opened a Way to our Resto∣ration,
by the Success of those very Measures
that were laid to disappoint Us for ever: And
We must earnestly conjure all Our Loving
Subjects, not to suffer that Spirit to faint or
die away, which has been so miraculously rai∣sed
in all Parts of our Kingdom; but to pursue,
with all the Vigour and Hopes of Success,
which so Just and Righteous a Cause ought to
inspire, those Methods, which the Finger of
God seems to point out to them.'</P>
<P>' We are coming to take Our Part in all the
Dangers and Difficulties to which any of Our
Subjects, from the Greatest down to the Mean∣est,
may be exposed, on this important Occa∣sion,
to relieve our Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> from
the Hardships they groan under, on account of
the late unhappy Union; and to restore the
Kingdom to its Ancient, Free, and Indepen∣dent
State. We have before our Eyes the Ex∣ample
of Our Royal Grandfather, who sell a
Sacrifice to Rebellion; and of Our Royal Un∣cle,
who, by a Train of Miracles, escaped the
Rage of Barbarous and Blood-thirsty Rebels, and
lived to exercise his Clemency towards those
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>
who had waged War against his Father and
himself; who had driven him to seek Shelter
in Foreign Lands, and who had even set a
Price upon his Head.'</P>
<P>' We see the same Instances of Cruelty renew∣ed
against Us, by Men of the same Principles,
without any other Reason, than the Conscious∣ness
of their own Guilt, and the implacable Ma∣lice
of their own Hearts: For in the Account
of such Men, it's a Crime sufficient to be their
King; but God forbid that we should tread in
these Steps, or that the Cause of a Lawsul Prince,
and an Injuried People, should be carried on like
that of Tyranny and Usurpation, and owe its
Support to Assassins. We shall copy after the
Patterns above-mentioned, and be ready with
the former of Our Royal Ancestors, to Seal the
Cause of our Country, if such be the Will of
Heaven, with Our Blood: But we hope for
better Things, we hope for the latter, to see
our just Rights, and those of the Church and
People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> once more settled in a Free
and Independent <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, on their an∣cient
Foundation; to such a Parliament, which
we will immediately call, shall we entirely re∣fer
Our, and their Interests, being sensible that
these Interests rightly understood, are always
the same: Let the Civil, as well as Religious
Rights of all our Subjects, receive a Confirma∣tion
in such a Parliament; let Consciences tru∣ly
tender be indulged; let Property of every
Kind be better than ever secured; let an Act
of General Grace and Amnesty, extinguish the
Faults, even of the most Guilty; if possible,
let the very Remembrance of all which have
preceeded this happy Moment, be utterly blot∣ted
out, that our Subjects may be united to Us,
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>
and to each other, in the strictest Bonds of Af∣fection,
as well as Interest.'</P>
<P>' And that nothing may be omitted, which is
in Our Power to contribute to this desirable
End; we do, by these Presents, absolutely
and effectually, for Us, Our Heirs and Suc∣cessors,
Pardon, Remit and Discharge all
Crimes of High-Treason, Misprision of Trea∣son,
and all other Crimes and Offences what∣soever
done or committed against Us, or Our
Royal Father of blessed Memory, by any of Our
Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, who
shall, at, or after Our Landing, and before they
engage in any Action against Us, or Our For∣ces,
from that Time, lay hold on Mercy, and
return to that Duty and Allegiance they owe to
Us, their only Rightful and Lawful Sovereign.'</P>
<P>' By the joint Endeavours of Us and Our Par∣liament,
urged by these Motives, and directed
to these Views, we may hope to see the Peace
and Flourishing Estate of this Kingdom, in a
short Time restor'd; and we shall be equally
forward to concert with our Parliament such
further Measures as may be thought necessary
for leaving the same to future Generations.'</P>
<P>' And we hereby require all Sheriffs of Shires,
Stewarts of Stewartries, and their Deputies,
and Magistrates of Burghs, to publish this Our
Declaration, immediately after it shall come
to their Hands, in the usual Place and Man∣ner,
under the Pain of being proceeded against
for Failure thereof, and forfeiting the Benefit
of our General Pardon.'</P>

<P><PB N="xxv" REF="24"/>
It is to be observed, That the Declarations by
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI>
insist on such Acts of Tyranny committed by
<HI>James</HI> II. as all the World knew to be true,
whereas the Pretender, and those who have now
rebell'd for the Support of his Claim, have no
such Thing to charge upon King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> but
traiterously misrepresent the legal Methods
which he has taken, with Consent of Parliament,
for the Defence of our Religion and Liberties,
and retrieving the Honour of the Nation, on
purpose to inflame the High-Church Mob.</P>
<P>It also deserves a Remark, that tho' the Duke
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was so weak as to be prevail'd on
by the Importunity of those who join'd him,
to take the Title of King, yet he did not posi∣tively
assert this Title to the Crown in his Decla∣ration,
but left it to be Determined by Parlia∣ment;
whereas King <HI>James</HI> II. never offer'd to
submit the Examination of the Pretender's Birth
to a Parliament, to whom the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
referr'd it, but on the contrary, abandon'd the
Kingdom, with his Queen, the Pretender, and
all the material Witnesses, as if he had been con∣scious
to himself, that such an Examination
wou'd have fully discover'd the Cheat. Nor has
the Pretender offer'd to make any Proof of his Le∣gitimacy,
or even to give such a feign'd Secu∣rity
for our Religion and Liberties as <HI>James</HI> II.
did, but on the contrary did absolutely refuse
the <HI>Scots</HI> Coronation Oath that was in Force be∣fore
the Union of the Crowns, because it oblig'd
him to maintain the Protestant Religion, as esta∣blish'd
in that Nation in the Reign of <HI>Mary</HI>
Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> and confirm'd by her Son <HI>James</HI>
VI. of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the First of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxvi" REF="25"/>
This is enough to shew the Difference betwixt
the Causes of the Rebellion against King <HI>James</HI>
II. and that against King <HI>GEORGE</HI>; and tho'
the latter has been much more universal and for∣midable
than the other, it will appear by the
following Accounts, that the Proceedings against
the present Rebels, have been kept within the
due Bounds of Law, and temper'd with great
Clemency, whereas those against the Rebels in
the Time of <HI>James</HI> II. did not only exceed Law,
but were carred on with such Barbarity as is
shocking to Human Nature.</P></Q>

<HEAD><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Account of what was done
against those in Scotland, who
took Arms there under the
Earl of Argyle, &amp;c. and a∣gainst
the Protestants in Ire∣land,
by the late King James,
and his Deputy Tyrconnel.</HEAD>
<P>IT is proper in the next Place, to give a brief
Account how the <HI>Scots,</HI> who took Arms in
their own Country against the Tyranny
of King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> II. were treat∣ed.
There were several Insurrections there, oc∣casion'd
by the barbarous Oppression of the Pres∣byterians,
for not conforming to the Tyranny
in Church and State then set up, which they
protested they could not in Conscience do, since
that Government was not only contrary to the
Fundamental Laws of the Nation, but to their
Principles, and the solemn Obligations which
the King and Kingdom lay under by Oaths a∣gainst
it; and that it was attended by such an un∣limited
Prerogative given the King by a pack'd
Parliament, as empower'd him by Virtue of his
Supremacy, which they called <HI>an inherent Right</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="58"/>
<HI>to the Crown,</HI> <Q REND="inline">' That he and his Successors might
settle, enact, and emit such Constitutions,
Acts, and Orders, concerning the Administrati∣on
of the External Government of the Church,
and the Persons employed in the same, and
concerning all Ecclesiastical Meetings, and
Matters to be proposed and determin'd there∣in,
as they in their Royal Wisdom should think
fit.'</Q> These are the very Words of the first Act
of the 2d Sessions of the first Parliament of <HI>Charles</HI>
II. and of the first Act of the second Parliament.</P>
<P>To force a Conformity to this sort of Govern∣ment
in Church and State, which King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
had solemnly abjur'd at his taking the Crown of
<HI>Scotland</HI> upon him, High Commission Courts
were not only set up by the Prerogative, which
acted contrary to Law, but Soldiers were em∣ploy'd
to oppress, pillage, harrass, imprison,
fine, and confine, beat and bind like Beasts,
those who refus'd it. Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> a bloody
and atheistical Man, commanded in three such
Expeditions against the <HI>Western</HI> Shires of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in 1663, 1665, and 1666. where he and his
Troops exacted from the poor People of <HI>Galloway</HI>
and <HI>Nithsdale,</HI> for their Nonconformity, betwixt
4 and 5000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, besides the great Charge
they were at by giving free Quarters, and Mo∣ney,
to the Soldiers, to forbear the Barbarities
which they practised on their Persons and Fa∣milies.
There was also levied by way of Fine,
without any Crime alledged, from 132 Gentle∣men,
and others, near 7000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, besides
free Quarters to the Soldiers sent to levy it,
which amounted to as much; and notwithstand∣ing
the Money which was paid to those barbarous
Troops to make them forbear Cruelties, it was
their common Custom to destroy all the Provi∣sions
<PB N="34" REF="59"/>
and Substance of those they quartered upon,
and to fill the Bellies of their Servants and Dogs,
before they would suffer the poor Families to eat
any of their own Provisions; nor did they be∣have
themselves thus only to those who did not
conform, but to many Gentlemen and others
who did; it being plainly the Design of the Court
to ruin the West of <HI>Scotland</HI>; because that Part
of the Kingdom had always, from the Time of
the Reformation, signalized their Zeal for their
Religion and Liberty. It was usual with them af∣ter
they had ruin'd the Tenants to quarter upon
their Landlords; and thus they harrass'd and
plunder'd that Part of the Country three Times
successively in the Years above-mention'd: And
besides the Money thus exacted, they forced Peo∣ple
to give Bonds for such other Sums as they
thought fit, by which they beggar'd abundance
of Families. And when any complain'd to the
commanding Officer of those Inhumanities, they
were commonly beaten, or otherwise barbarously
treated. The Soldiers did likewise behave
themselves so atheistically, that they publickly
mock'd at all Religion, utter'd most horrible
Curses and Oaths, ravish'd Women, and in short,
their Behaviour was more like Savages and Pa∣gans
than civilized Men and Christians: and af∣ter
they had thus ruin'd the Country, they extor∣ted
Certificates from the People, That they had
been civilly used, on purpose to prevent their
making Application to the Government for Re∣dress;
and when they had nothing left to pay
what the Soldiers demanded, they were barba∣rously
used in their Persons, and carried to Pri∣sons,
tied Hand and Foot, like Beasts. After
the Country had been 7 Months thus oppress'd in
Sir <HI>James</HI>'s third Expedition, three Country-men
<PB N="35" REF="60"/>
met four of his Soldiers carrying a poor old Man,
one of their Neighbours, in that Manner to
<HI>Dumfries</HI>; they begg'd the Soldiers to unty him,
who, instead of doing it, attack'd the Country∣men
with their Swords, but were worsted in the
Scuffle, one of them wounded, and the other
three threw down their Arms. This encourag'd
these Men, with some others, to attack 10 or 12
more of the Soldiers, who were in like manner
oppressing the People in that same Parish, and
these they also disarmed, having kill'd one that
made an obstinate Resistance. The Neighbour∣hood
knowing that Sir <HI>James</HI> would take a terri∣ble
Revenge upon them, about 54 of them took
Horse, and with a few Footmen marched to
<HI>Dumfries,</HI> where they took Sir <HI>James,</HI> and dis∣arm'd
his Men. Having done this, they march∣ed
to the <HI>West,</HI> where the People were oppress'd
in the like Manner, and being join'd by others,
came at last to be 7 or 800. Upon this Lieute∣nant
General <HI>Dalzeel</HI> was ordered to march a∣gainst
them with the regular Troops, they were
declared Rebels, and order'd to lay down their
Arms within 24 Hours after the Proclamation
was published, without the least Assurance of
Pardon, and all the Subjects were ordered to as∣sist
the General, on pain of Rebellion. This poor
Handful being thus made desperate, they march∣ed
within two Miles of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and a Cessa∣tion
was agreed between the General and them
for one Night, until their Grievances and Peti∣tion
might be presented by him to the Council.
This made them secure, and the General, con∣trary
to Agreement, surpriz'd them just at the
Time when his Messenger was delivering their
Petition to the Council. They made a stout Re∣sistance,
and repuls'd his advanced Troops three
<PB N="36" REF="61"/>
Times, but being vastly inferior in Number, and
fatigued with long Marches, Hunger, Rain and
Cold, they were defeated on the 28th of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI>
1666. 40 of 'em kill'd, and above 130 of
them taken, many of whom were executed with
the greatest Cruelty and Barbarity, and some of
them tortured by an Engine called a Boot, to
make them discover others, and such as had gi∣ven
them any Assistance or Relief. Besides, it
was made Treason for any one to harbour such
of them as had escaped. This was the first In∣surrection
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> known by the Name of
<HI>Pentland-Hills,</HI> which was the Place where they
fought.</P>
<P>These Barbarities served only to incense the
Country, and to make the People of the Western
Shires more averse to Conformity than before.
This occasion'd many severe Laws to force them
to a Compliance, which not having the design'd
Effect, an Army of barbarous Highlanders was
twice brought down upon the Country, which
they plunder's, treated the People with all sort
of Inhumanity, garrison'd Gentlemen's Houses
contrary to Law, impos'd Bonds and Oaths upon
the People without Authority of Parliament,
and committed such other Outrages, as if they
had been in an Enemies Country. But all this
not prevailing with the People to conform, or to
abstain from Worship in the Fields, when they
could not do it in Houses, Troops were employ∣ed
to attack the People where-ever they were as∣sembled,
which oblig'd them frequently to stand
on their Defence, and all that did so being made
Guilty of Death, this brought on the second In∣surrection
at <HI>Bothwell-bridge,</HI> in 1679. where the
poor oppressed People being vastly out-number'd
by the King's Army, under the Command of the
<PB N="37" REF="62"/>
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> about 300 of 'em, after a
stout Resistance, were kill'd, the rest put to
flight, and above 1000 taken, and carried to <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI>
where they were a long time kept in
an open Church-yard without any Shelter from
Cold or Rain; several Ministers and others were
executed, and about 1700 taken there, and at
other Places before, sold for Slaves to <HI>America,</HI>
and other Parts, 200 of which were cast away
near <HI>Orkney,</HI> thro' the Barbarity of the Captain
of the Ship, who order'd them to be kept under
Hatches, when his Ship struck, otherwise they
might have escaped as well as he, and his Men,
and about 50 others of their Fellow Prisoners.</P>
<P>The Country was made a perfect Scene of Hor∣ror
and Cruelty, by the Pursuits which were
made after those who escaped from the Field,
and the proscribing, or putting to Death such
as were found to give them any Relief, though
their nearest Relations. And Acts were made
to make it Death for any Presbyterian Ministers
to preach, or People to hear them, in House or
Field.</P>
<P>These barbarous Oppressions made a Part of
the People so mad, that some of them thought
themselves absolved from giving any further O∣bedience
to King <HI>Charles</HI> II. or those commission∣ed
under him; and therefore took upon them to
declare, That he had forfeited his Crown by his
Perjury and Tyranny, and that they would no
more own him as their Sovereign. Though this
was known to be contrary to the declared Princi∣ples
of the Presbyterians, and perfectly inconsi∣stent
with what they held themselves to be obli∣ged
to by the <HI>Solemn League and Covenant,</HI> which
bound them to maintain the King's just Preroga∣tive,
and the Authority of Parliaments, from
<PB N="38" REF="63"/>
whom their Kings derived their Authority, and
without whose Consent they held they could not
be depriv'd of it; yet the Practice of those few
desperate Men was made a Handle to oppress all
the Presbyterians, and to impose new Oaths and
Bonds upon them. In the mean time that Hand∣ful
of Men who had thus thrown off the King's
Authority, were pursued from Place to Place,
and kill'd without any Tryal, where-ever they
were found; and the Soldiers had an illegal
Power given them by the Council to tender a
Bond or Oath, to all that they pleased, to dis∣own
the Declaration of those Men; and if they
refused it, they were presently to kill them; and
thus they murder'd, without any Trial, about 78
People, in several Parts of the Country, and in
such a barbarous Manner, that they would not
allow those poor People Time to recommend
themselves to God, before they were shot or
stabb'd, but answer'd them with this atheistical
Sarcasm, <HI>What the Devil have you been doing so
many Years? Ha'n't you had Time enough to pray in
the Caves and Mountains!</HI></P>
<P>The murmuring Faction cannot pretend that
the present Rebels were forced by any such Ex∣tremities
as these, to take Arms, nor have they
any Ground to complain of any such Inquisitor∣like
Proceedings against their Friends; and 'tis
well for them 'tis so; otherwise there had been
such a Havock long e'er now among the High∣Church
Party, that few or none of them would
have been left to belch out Lies and Treason eve∣ry
Day against the Government.</P>
<P>I come now to the last Insurrection in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
before the Revolution, which was that un∣der
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> already mention'd: The
Causes of it are to be seen in his Declaration,
<PB N="39" REF="64"/>
as above, so that there's little more to be said of
it, but that his Lordship not being able to raise
above 2000 Men, because of the Precautions
which the Government had taken against him
upon the early Notice they had of his Design, he
only wander'd about for 6 or 7 Weeks, in the
Western Highlands, where being block'd up by
the King's Men of War, and straiten'd for Pro∣visions,
abundance of his Men deserted; and com∣ing
at last towards <HI>Dumbarton</HI> and <HI>Glasgow,</HI> he
was intercepted by a numerous Army; and his
Men perceiving that the Enemy was ten times
their Number, and being also wearied out with
long Marches, want of Provisions, and Sleep,
most of them withdrew in the Night, and the
few that kept together, were, after some Skir∣mishes
with a Party of the Enemy, whom they
defeated, obliged likewise to disperse; the Earl
himself, with a few more, were taken, and exe∣cuted
at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as about 20 of his Men were
at his Seat at <HI>Innerary</HI> in the Highlands; and ma∣ny
others taken up afterwards on Suspicion, or o∣therwise,
were banish'd to <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis observable, That the Earl was not execu∣ted
upon the Account of this Rebellion; but be∣cause
of an Explanation which he offered of the
Test that had been made, for all those in Places
of Power and Trust, when the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> settled the Succession upon the Duke of
<HI>York:</HI> This was so much the more extraordinary,
that several of the Episcopal Party had been al∣low'd
to take it with such Explanations, because
it was contradictory in it self, and were never
called in question for it: But the Reason why
the Earl was pick'd out to be a Sacrifice, was
the Greatness of his Quality and Power, which
the Court knew would make it difficult for them
<PB N="40" REF="65"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Scotland,</HI> so long as a person of his Weight and
Interest in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="4+ letters" DISP="••••…"/>try was left in being.</P>
<P>After his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>James</HI> II. thought he might do
what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would in <HI>Scotland:</HI> He persecuted the
Presbyterians with the Height of Barbarity, and
overturn'd the Constitution by an arbitrary Pro∣clamation, <HI>Feb.</HI> 12. 168<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. wherein he granted
an unlimited Toleration by his <HI>Sovereign Autho∣rity,</HI>
<HI>Prerog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive Royal,</HI> and <HI>Absolute Power,</HI> which
he alledg'd <HI>all his Subjects ought to obey without</HI> Re∣serve:
This, with other things mentioned in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Declaration of Rights, brought on the Re∣volution
there, as appears by the 13th Act of
their Convention, <HI>Apr.</HI> 11. 1689, wherein they
charge him with having invaded the Fundamen∣tal
Constitution of the Kingdom; That he alter∣ed
it from a legal limitted Monarchy to an arbi∣trary
despotick Power; and in a publick Procla∣mation
asserted an absolute Power to annul all
the Laws, and particularly arraign'd those which
establish'd the Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>I come next to take a View of King <HI>James</HI> II's
Administration in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Soon after his Acces∣sion
to the <HI>British</HI> Throne, he sent that bigotted
Papist and Tyrant, the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnel,</HI> to be
Lord Lieutenant of that Kingdom, at the Re∣quest
of the Popish Clergy there, who, in their
letter to the King, of <HI>July,</HI> 1625. said, <Q REND="inline">' That <HI>Tyr∣connel</HI>
was the Person that did first espouse, and
chiefly maintain their Cause for the last 25
Years, and was the only Man on whose Forti∣tude
and Popularity they durst with Chear∣fulness
own their Lovalty, and assert his Ma∣jesty's
interest: Therefore they prayed, That
his Majesty would be pleased to lodge his Au∣thority
in his Hands, to the Terror of the Fa∣ction,
meaning the Protestants.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="66"/>
<HI>Tyrconnel</HI> fully answered their Expectations,
and in a little Time cashier'd the Protestant Ar∣my
in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which consisted of about 7000
Men, and form'd another of Papists, most of
whom were the Descendants, or near Relations
of those that had been attainted for the Rebellion
and Massacre in 1641, or had signalized them∣selves
by notorious Villanies, and implacable
Hatred to the <HI>English,</HI> and Protestant Interest in
that Nation.</P>
<P>In the next Place he set up Judges there, who
were engaged by Interest and Inclination to
destroy the Protestant Religion; and one of
them, called <HI>Rice,</HI> a prosligate Papist, who was
advanced to be Lord Chief Baron, had the Im∣pudence
to declare, he would draw a Coach and
six Horses through the Act of Settlement, which
was the Chief Security the Protestants had in that
Kingdom. Sir <HI>Alexander Fitton,</HI> who had been
convicted of Forgery at <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and
<HI>Chester,</HI> and fin'd for it by the Lords in Parlia∣ment,
was taken out of Goal, and made Lord
High Chancellor of <HI>Ireland,</HI> because he turned
Papist; and was so zealous to shew himself a true
Convert, that he several times declared with the
Height of Impudence from the Bench, <HI>That the
Irish Protestants were all Rogues, and that there was
not one among</HI> 40000 <HI>of 'em, but was a Traytor, Re∣bel
and Villain.</HI></P>
<P>The Privy Council in <HI>Ireland</HI> was compos'd of
a Majority of Papisis; so that the Protestants na∣med
as Members of it, declined to act; because
they were sensible that they could do their Religi∣on
and the <HI>English</HI> Interest no manner of Service.</P>
<P>There wanted nothing else but to model a
House of Commons to the Designs of the Court,
and in order to that the Charters of all Corpora∣tions
<PB N="42" REF="67"/>
were seiz'd by <HI>Quo Warranto</HI>'s, without a∣ny
Cause or Shadow of Law; so that the Magi∣stracies
of Corporations were fill'd up with Pa∣pists,
and Men of desperate, or no Fortunes; and
the new Charters had a Clause by which the
chief Governour was impower'd to turn out and
put in whom he pleased, without shewing a Rea∣son.</P>
<P>The
Protestant Clergy were oppressed by <HI>Tyr∣connel,</HI>
and the Popish Priests did openly demand
the Tythes belonging to them, and forbad their
People to pay the Tythes to the Protestant In∣cumbents,
on Pain of Damnation. This pass'd
afterwards into an Act, by which the Papists
were to pay their Tythes only to their own
Priests; and afterwards, as any Protestant Bi∣shop
or Clergyman died, Papists were put into
their Places by the King's Privy Signet, or Sign
Manual.</P>
<P>In the next Place <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> stopp'd the Salaries
of the University of <HI>Dublin,</HI> because they would
not, contrary to the Laws and their Oaths, admit
a vicious ignorant Papist into a vacant Fellow∣ship;
and when King <HI>James</HI> arrived there after
the Revolution, the Protestant Vice President,
Fellows and Scholars, were all turn'd out, their
Furniture, Library, Communion Plate, and e∣very
thing belonging to the College was taken a∣way,
the House made a Garrison, and their
Chambers made Prisons for Protestants; tho'
King <HI>James</HI> had promised to preserve their
Liberties and Properties, and rather augment
than diminish the Privileges which had been
granted them by his Predecessors. At last most
of the Churches in and about <HI>Dublin,</HI> were seiz'd
on by the Government, and an Order was issu∣ed,
forbidding more than 5 Protestants to meet,
<PB N="43" REF="68"/>
under Pain of Death, so that all religious Assem∣blies
through the whole Kingdom, were prohi∣bited
to Protestants.</P>
<P>To complete their Ruin, an Act of Attainder
was pass'd in Parliament, in order to which, eve∣ry
Member of the House of Commons returned
the Names of all such Protestant Gentlemen as
lived near them, or in the County or Borough
for which he served; or if he was a Stranger to
any of them, he sent to the Country for Infor∣mation
about them. When the Bill was present∣ed
to the King for his Assent, the Speaker told
him, That many were attainted in that Act up∣on
such Evidence as satisfied the House, and the
rest upon Common Fame.</P>
<P>In this Act, no fewer were attainted than two
Archbishops, one Duke, 17 Earls, 7 Countesses,
28 Viscounts, 2 Viscountesses, 7 Bishops, 18 Ba∣rons,
33 Baronets, 51 Knights, 83 Clergymen,
2182 Esquires and Gentlemen, <HI>and all of 'em un∣heard,</HI>
declared and adjudged Traytors, convict∣ed
and attainted of High-Treason, and adjudged
to suffer the Pains of Death and Forseiture. The
famous Proscription of <HI>Rome</HI> during the last Tri∣umvirate,
came not up in some Respects to the
Horror of this; for there were condemned in this
little Kingdom more than double the Number
that were proscribed through the vast Bounds of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. And to make this of <HI>Ireland</HI>
yet the more terrible, and to put the Persons at∣tainted
out of a Possibility of escaping, the Act
it self was concealed, and no Protestant allow'd a
Copy of it, till four Months after it was past:
Whereas in that of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Names of the Per∣sons
proscribed were affixed upon all the publick
Places of the City, and the very Day the Proscrip∣tion
was concerted; and thereby Opportunity
<PB N="44" REF="69"/>
was given to many of the noblest Families in
<HI>Rome,</HI> to preserve themselves by a speedy Flight
for better Times.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>LET our Murmerers speak from their Con∣sciences,
if they have any: Can the most
abandon'd of them have the Face to say, That
there is not a very great Difference betwixt the
Cause of those who took Arms against Tyranny
and Popery in the three Nations, during the
Reigns of King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> II. and
of such as have taken Arms to set up an Impostor,
and to bring in Tyranny and Popery in the
Reign of King <HI>G E O R G E.</HI> Is there not a very
great Difference betwixt those who ventur'd their
Lives and Fortunes to save Us from the Slavery
of <HI>France,</HI> and Idolatry of <HI>Rome,</HI> and those who
would have delivered us up in Chains to both.</P>
<P>And as the Difference betwixt the Causes is
remarkable, the Difference betwixt the Conduct
of the Parties is no less so. Can Envy and Ma∣lice
charge the <HI>Whigs</HI> in those Reigns to have
join'd with Papists in pulling down Places of
Protestant Worship, whilst Mass-Houses pass'd
untouched? Can they be charged to have join∣ed
with Papists to insult Prince and Parliament,
in order to interrupt the Course of Justice a∣gainst
an Incendiary, for preaching Sedition and
Treason? Can they be charged with a Rebelli∣on
to screen a Ministry from Justice, who had
betrayed their Religion, their Liberty, their
Country, their Trade, their Sovereign, and all
<HI>Europe,</HI> into the Hands of <HI>France?</HI> Can they be
<PB N="45" REF="70"/>
charged with taking Arms for Ministers who had
perswaded their Sovereign to break Oaths and
Leagues, to betray our Allies in Council and
Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and to utter the grossest Contradictions
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alshoods from the Throne? Can they be
charged with concurring in a Design to defeat a
Protestant Succession, and set a Papist on the
Throne by execrable Tricks and Perjuries, and
particularly by taking Oaths to the Government,
on purpose to undermine it. Or can they be
charged, when in Arms, with burning and plun∣dering
their Native Country, or to have join'd
with Domestick and Foreign Papists, to set up a
Popish Pretender, and murther and dethrone a
Protestant King, and his whole Royal Family.</P>
<P>The Faction, tho' Case-harden'd to the great∣est
Degree, can't charge such Things upon those
who took Arms against the Male-Administrations
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and King <HI>James</HI> II.</P>
<P>Then, as to the Difference betwixt the Treat∣ment
of those who took Arms against those Prin∣ces,
and our present Rebels, can the Faction
have the Impudence to say, That our Generals
have treated the present Rebels, as <HI>Kirk</HI> did
those who took Arms under the Duke of <HI>Mon∣mouth,</HI>
when he ordered 90 of the poor wounded
Prisoners to be immediately hang'd at <HI>Taunton,</HI>
without allowing their poor Wives and Children
to speak to them, and at the same time made his
Pipes to play, his Drums to beat, and his Trum∣pets
to found, that the People might not hear
what they said at the Place of Execution; after
which he order'd their Quarters to be boil'd in
Pitch, and set up in several Parts of the Town;
for which, when he was afterwards question'd,
he pleaded the Orders of the King and his Gene∣ral.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="71"/>
Can they say that our Judges have hector'd Ju∣ries
to bring in any of the Rebels Guilty, after
they had three times acquitted them: as <HI>Jefferies</HI>
did in the Case of the Lady <HI>Lisle?</HI></P>
<P>Can they say that our Judges have trapanned
any of the Rebels to confess themselves Guilty,
in Hopes of Pardon, as <HI>Jefferies</HI> did, and then
hang them up afterwards by Scores, without al∣lowing
them Time to prepare for Death?</P>
<P>Can they say that our Judges have extorted a∣ny
Sums from the Rebels for procuring them Par∣dons,
or much less that they have extorted 14500<HI>l.</HI>
from any Rebel of Note for a Pardon, as he did
in order to purchase himself an Estate?</P>
<P>Can they say that our Judges have condemn'd
above 500 Persons upon very slight, or no Evi∣dence,
as he did at <HI>Taunton</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> where a∣bove
239 were executed, and their Quarters dis∣pers'd
in the principal Places and Roads of the
Country?</P>
<P>Can they say that our Judges have prosecuted
Girls of 8 or 9 Years old for High-Treason, be∣cause
they presented a few Colours to the Rebels,
as <HI>Jefferies</HI> did, and forc'd their Parents to pay as
much for their Pardon as would have made them
handsome Fortunes?</P>
<P>Let them look upon the Lists above, and com∣pare
them with the Lists of those tryed lately at
<HI>Liverpoole,</HI> and publish'd in the <HI>Flying-Post</HI> of <HI>Feb.</HI>
14. and then tell us, whether the Clemency of
King <HI>James</HI> II. or that of King <HI>GEORGE</HI> is
the greatest.</P>
<P>Let them turn their Eyes to the abovemen∣tion'd
Accounts of the Proceedings against the
Rebels in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Reigns of the two Bro∣thers,
and see if they can find such Barbarities
now as were practis'd there at that Time.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="72"/>
Have any of the present Rebels been tortur'd
with Boots and Thumbkins to make them disco∣ver
the rest, and who gave them any Relief or
Encouragement?</P>
<P>Can they tell us of any that have been pro∣scrib'd,
or put to Death for entertaining the pre∣sent
Rebels, tho' their nearest Relations?</P>
<P>Let them tell us, if they can, where any of the
present Rebels have been drown'd on purpose,
under the Pretence of being transported to Fo∣reign
Plantations.</P>
<P>Can they give us any Instances that the pre∣sent
Rebels have been examin'd upon captious
Questions by Privy-Councils and Judges, and
hang'd for not answering such Questions, as was
practis'd in <HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>Can they tell us of any Parties of Soldiers sent
out to murder those whom they met in the Fields
and Roads, that would not disown the Preten∣der's
Declaration or Title. And let them tell us
if they can, whether Inn-keepers and Hostlers
are empower'd to examine their Guests and Tra∣vellers
upon such Questions; and of Magistrates
being empower'd to hang such Persons immedi∣ately,
as had not Certificates of their having dis∣own'd
the Pretender and his Title, or would not
do it when brought before them?</P>
<P>Have the present Rebels, taken in the Act,
been exposed without Cover to the Rigour of the
Season by Hundreds together, and left to strave,
as those that were taken at <HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge in
<HI>Scotland?</HI></P>
<P>Let them next take a Tour to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
find out Instances there, where the Pretender's
Friends have been attainted in Parliament upon
Common Fame, and the Act concealed that they
might have no Opportunity to make their Es∣cape.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="73"/>
A great deal more might be said of the Inhu∣man
and Barbarous Proceedings of those Reigns;
but this is more than enough to convict our Mur∣murers
of Falshood, who cry out against the
gentle Methods of Justice now made use of to
punish such as have rais'd the most unnatural and
ill-grounded Rebellion that was ever heard of up∣on
Earth.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with one Rebuke to the Jaco∣bite
Females, who take upon them to make
Treason their ordinary Tattle, that 'tis well for
them that they don't live under such an Admi∣nistration,
as that of <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>James</HI> II. in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
when poor Country Girls were hang'd with∣out
Mercy, for saying that <HI>Charles</HI> had forfeited
his Title to the Crown by breaking the Original
Contract, or Covenant, on which he took it, and
that <HI>James</HI> being a profess'd Papist, had no Right
to the Crown, because it was coutrary to the
Fundamental Laws of the Nation, and particu∣larly
that of King <HI>James</HI> VI. which obliged al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Princes to swear at their Coronation that
they were Protestants, would maintain that Reli∣gion,
as then established, and abolish all false
Religion, Idolatry, and Heresy. I would also
advise those Jacobite Ladies who make so bold
with the present Government at their Tea-Ta∣bles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and discover so much Inclination to fa∣vour
the Rebels, to remember what the Lady
<HI>Lisle,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Gaunt</HI> suffer'd, for Crimes of a
far less Nature in the Eye of the Law, as it then
stood, or rather was wrested.</P>
