<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable <HI>RICHARD</HI> Earl of <HI>BURLINGTON.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>'TIS strange, the Miser should his Cares imploy</L>
<L>To <HI>gain</HI> those Riches he can ne'er <HI>enjoy:</HI></L>
<L>Is it less strange, the Prodigal should <HI>waste</HI></L>
<L>His Wealth to purchase what he ne'er can <HI>taste?</HI></L>
<L>Not for himself he sees, or hears, or eats;</L>
<L>Artists must chuse his Pictures, Music, Meats:</L>
<L>He buys for <HI>Topham</HI> Drawings and Designs,</L>
<L>For <HI>Fountain</HI> Statues, and for <HI>Curio</HI> Coins,</L>
<L>Rare Monkish Manuscripts for <HI>Hearne</HI> alone,</L>
<L>And Books for <HI>Mead,</HI> and Rarities for <HI>Sloan.</HI></L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Think we all these are for himself? no more</L>
<L>Than his fine Wife (my Lord) or finer Whore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For what has <HI>Virro</HI> painted, built, and planted?</L>
<L>Only to shew <HI>how many</HI> Tastes he wanted.</L>
<L>What brought Sir <HI>Shylock</HI>'s ill-got Wealth to waste?</L>
<L>Some Daemon whisper'd, "<HI>Knights</HI> shou'd have a <HI>Taste.</HI>"</L>
<L>Heav'n visits with a <HI>Taste</HI> the wealthy Fool,</L>
<L>And needs no Rod, but <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>d</HI> with a Rule.</L>
<L>See sportive Fate, to punish aukward Pride,</L>
<L>Bids <HI>Babo</HI> build, and sends him such a Guide:</L>
<L>A standing Sermon! at each Year's expence,</L>
<L>That never Coxcomb reach'd Magnificence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft have have you hinted to your Brother Peer,</L>
<L>A certain Truth, which many buy too dear:</L>
<L>Something there is, more needful than Expence,</L>
<L>And something previous ev'n to Taste—'Tis <HI>Sense;</HI></L>
<L>Good Sense, which only is the Gift of Heav'n,</L>
<L>And tho' no Science, fairly worth the Seven.</L>
<L>A Light, which in <HI>yourself</HI> you must perceive;</L>

<L>To build, to plant, whatever you intend,</L>
<L>To rear the Column, or the Arch to bend,</L>
<L>To swell the Terras, or to sink the Grot;</L>
<L>In all, let <HI>Nature</HI> never be forgot.</L>
<L>Consult the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>Place</HI> in all,</L>
<L>That tells the Waters or to rise, or fall,</L>
<L>Or helps th' ambitious Hill the Heav'ns to scale,</L>
<L>Or scoops in circling Theatres the Vale,</L>
<L>Calls in the Country, catches opening Glades,</L>
<L>Joins willing Woods, and varies Shades from Shades,</L>
<L>Now breaks, or now directs, th' intending Lines;</L>
<L><HI>Paints</HI> as you plant, and as you work, <HI>Designs.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>Begin with <HI>Sense,</HI> of ev'ry Art the Soul,</L>
<L>Parts answ'ring Parts, shall slide into a Whole,</L>
<L>Spontaneous Beauties all around advance,</L>
<L>Start, ev'n from <HI>Difficulty,</HI> strike, from <HI>Chance;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nature</HI> shall join you; <HI>Time</HI> shall make it grow</L>
<L>A Work to wonder at—perhaps a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Seat and Gardens of the Lord Viscount <HI>Cobham</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire.</HI></NOTE>STOW.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Without it, proud <HI>Versailles!</HI> thy Glory falls,</L>
<L>And <HI>Nero</HI>'s Terrasses desert their Walls:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
The vast <HI>Parterres</HI> a thousand hands shall make,</L>
<L>Lo! <HI>Bridgman</HI> comes, and floats them with a <HI>Lake:</HI></L>
<L>Or cut wide <HI>Views</HI> thro' Mountains to the Plain,</L>
<L>You'll wish your Hill, and shelter'd Seat, again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold <HI>Villario</HI>'s ten-years Toil compleat,</L>
<L>His <HI>Quincunx</HI> darkens, his Espaliers meet,</L>
<L>The Wood supports the Plain; the Parts unite,</L>
<L>And strength of Shade contends with strength of Light;</L>
<L>His bloomy Beds a waving Glow display,</L>
<L>Blushing in bright Diversities of Day,</L>
<L>With silver-quiv'ring Rills maeander'd o'er—</L>
<L>—Enjoy them, you! <HI>Villario</HI> can no more,</L>
<L>Tir'd of the Scene Parterres and Fountains yield,</L>
<L>He finds at last he better likes a Field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thro' his young Woods how pleas'd <HI>Sabinus</HI> stray'd,</L>
<L>Or sate delighted in the thick'ning Shade,</L>
<L>With annual Joy the red'ning Shoots to greet,</L>
<L>And see the stretching Branches long to meet!</L>

<L><PB N="9" REF="7"/>
One <HI>boundless Green</HI> or <HI>flourish'd Carpet</HI> views,</L>
<L>With all the mournful Family of <HI>Yews;</HI></L>
<L>The thriving Plants ignoble Broomsticks made</L>
<L>Now sweep those Allies they were born to shade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet hence the <HI>Poor</HI> are cloth'd, the <HI>Hungry</HI> fed;</L>
<L><HI>Health</HI> to himself, and to his Infants <HI>Bread</HI></L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears; What thy hard Heart denies,</L>
<L>Thy charitable Vanity supplies.</L>
<L>Another Age shall see the golden Ear</L>
<L>Imbrown thy Slope, and nod on thy Parterre,</L>
<L>Deep Harvests bury all thy Pride has plann'd,</L>
<L>And laughing <HI>Ceres</HI> re-assume the Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At <HI>Timon</HI>'s <HI>Villa</HI> let us pass a Day,</L>
<L>Where all cry out, "What Sums are thrown away!</L>
<L>So proud, so grand, of that stupendous Air,</L>
<L><HI>Soft</HI> and <HI>Agreeable</HI> come never there.</L>
<L>Greatness, with <HI>Timon,</HI> dwells in such a Draught</L>
<L>As brings all <HI>Brobdignag</HI> before your Thought:</L>
<L>To compass this, his Building is a Town,</L>
<L>His Pond an Ocean, his Parterre a Down;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="8"/>
Who but must laugh the Master when he sees?</L>
<L>A puny Insect, shiv'ring at a Breeze!</L>
<L>Lo! what huge Heaps of Littleness around!</L>
<L>The Whole, a labour'd Quarry above ground!</L>
<L>Two <HI>Cupids</HI> squirt before: A Lake behind</L>
<L>Improves the keenness of the Northern Wind.</L>
<L>His <HI>Gardens</HI> next your Admiration call,</L>
<L>On ev'ry side you look, behold the Wall!</L>
<L>No pleasing Intricacies intervene,</L>
<L>No artful Wildeness to perplex the Scene:</L>
<L>Grove nods at Grove, each Ally has a Brother,</L>
<L>And half the Platform just reflects the other.</L>
<L>The suff'ring Eye inverted Nature sees,</L>
<L>Trees cut to Statues, Statues thick as Trees,</L>
<L>With here a Fountain, never to be play'd,</L>
<L>And there a Summer-house, that knows no Shade.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Amphitrite</HI> sails thro' Myrtle bow'rs;</L>
<L>Then <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The two famous Statues of the <HI>Gladiator pugnans, &amp; Gladiator moriens.</HI></NOTE><HI>Gladiators</HI> fight, or die, in flow'rs;</L>

<L>And Swallows roost in <HI>Nilus'</HI> dusty Urn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>Behold! my Lord advances o'er the Green,</L>
<L>Smit with the mighty pleasure, to be seen:</L>
<L>But soft—by regular approach—not yet—</L>
<L>First thro' the length of yon hot Terras sweat,</L>
<L>And when up ten steep Slopes you've dragg'd your thighs,</L>
<L>Just at his Study-door he'll bless your Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His <HI>Study?</HI> with what Authors is it stor'd?</L>
<L>In Books, not Authors, curious is my Lord;</L>
<L>To all their <HI>dated Backs</HI> he turns you round,</L>
<L>These <HI>Aldus</HI> printed, those <HI>Du Suëil</HI> has <HI>bound.</HI></L>
<L>Lo some are <HI>Vellom,</HI> and the rest as good</L>
<L>For all his Lordship knows, but they are <HI>Wood.</HI></L>
<L>For <HI>Lock</HI> or <HI>Milton</HI> 'tis in vain to look,</L>
<L>These Shelves admit not any Modern book.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the Chappel's silver bell you hear,</L>
<L>That summons you to all the Pride of Pray'r:</L>
<L>Light Quirks of Musick, broken and uneven,</L>
<L>Make the Soul dance upon a Jig to Heaven.</L>
<L>On painted Cielings you devoutly stare,</L>
<L>Where sprawl the Saints of <HI>Verrio,</HI> or <HI>Laguerre,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
On gilded Clouds in fair expansion lie,</L>
<L>And bring all Paradise before your Eye.</L>
<L>To Rest, the Cushion, and soft <HI>Dean</HI> invite,</L>
<L>Who never mentions Hell to Ears polite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hark! the chiming Clocks to Dinner call;</L>
<L>A hundred Footsteps scrape the marble Hall:</L>
<L>The rich Buffet well-colour'd <HI>Serpents</HI> grace,</L>
<L>And gaping <HI>Tritons</HI> spew to wash your Face.</L>
<L>Is this a Dinner? this a Genial Room?</L>
<L>No, 'tis a Temple, and a Hecatomb;</L>
<L>A solemn Sacrifice, perform'd in State,</L>
<L>You drink by Measure, and to Minutes eat.</L>
<L>So quick retires each flying Course, you'd swear</L>
<L><HI>Sancho</HI>'s dread Doctor and his Wand were there:</L>
<L>Between each Act the trembling Salvers ring,</L>
<L>From Soup to Sweetwine, and <HI>God bless the King.</HI></L>
<L>In Plenty starving, tantaliz'd in State,</L>
<L>And complaisantly help'd to all I hate,</L>
<L>Treated, caress'd, and tir'd, I take my leave,</L>
<L>Sick of his civil Pride, from Morn to Eve;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="11"/>
I curse such lavish Cost, and little Skill,</L>
<L>And swear, no Day was ever past so ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In you, my <HI>Lord,</HI> Taste sanctifies Expence,</L>
<L>For Splendor borrows all her Rays from Sense.</L>
<L>You show us, <HI>Rome</HI> was glorious, not profuse,</L>
<L>And pompous Buildings once were things of use.</L>
<L>Just as they are, yet shall your noble Rules</L>
<L>Fill half the Land with <HI>Imitating Fools,</HI></L>
<L>Who random Drawings from your Sheets shall take,</L>
<L>And of one Beauty many Blunders make;</L>
<L>Load some vain Church with old Theatric State;</L>
<L>Turn Arcs of Triumph to a Garden-gate;</L>
<L>Reverse your Ornaments, and hang them all</L>
<L>On some patch'd Doghole ek'd with Ends of Wall,</L>
<L>Then clap four slices of Pilaster on't,</L>
<L>And lac'd with bits of Rustic, 'tis a Front:</L>
<L>Shall call the Winds thro' long Arcades to roar,</L>
<L>Proud to catch cold at a <HI>Venetian</HI> door;</L>
<L>Conscious they act a true <HI>Palladian</HI> part,</L>
<L>And if they starve, they starve by Rules of Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<L>Yet thou proceed; be fallen Arts thy care,</L>
<L>Erect new Wonders, and the Old repair,</L>
<L><HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Palladio</HI> to themselves restore,</L>
<L>And be whate'er <HI>Vitruvius</HI> was before:</L>
<L>Till Kings call forth th' Idea's of thy Mind,</L>
<L>Proud to accomplish what such hands design'd,</L>
<L>Bid Harbors open, publick Ways extend,</L>
<L>And Temples, worthier of the God, ascend;</L>
<L>Bid the broad Arch the dang'rous Flood contain,</L>
<L>The Mole projected break the roaring Main;</L>
<L>Back to his bounds their subject Sea command,</L>
<L>And roll obedient Rivers thro' the Land:</L>
<L>These Honours, Peace to happy <HI>Britain</HI> brings,</L>
<L>These are Imperial Works, and worthy <HI>Kings.</HI></L>
