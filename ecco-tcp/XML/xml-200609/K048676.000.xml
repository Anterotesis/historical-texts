<HEAD>The DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception: They have been call'd by a very general name, THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION. Like the external senses, they relate to matter and motion; and at the same time, give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike. As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures we are acquainted with, men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford, independent of the objects which originally produc'd them. This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts; some of which, as painting and sculpture, directly copy the ex∣ternal appearances which were admir'd in nature; others, as music and poetry, bring them back to remembrance by signs universally establish'd and understood.</P>
<P>But these arts, as they grew more correct and deliberate, were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imagina∣tive powers; especially poetry, which making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates, is consequently become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being. Yet as their primary intention was only to express the objects of imagination, and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class, they of course retain their original character, and all the different pleasures they excite, are term'd, in general, PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION.</P>
<P>The Design of the following poem is to give a view of <HI>these,</HI> in the largest acceptation of the term; <HI>so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature, and all the various entertain∣ment we meet with either in poetry, painting, music, or any of the elegant arts, might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the consti∣tution of the human mind, which are here establish'd and explain'd.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties, and then to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant, and which are by nature adapted to it, as light is to the eyes, or truth to the understanding. These properties Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> had reduc'd to the three general classes of greatness, novelty, and beauty; and into these we may analyse every object, however complex, which, properly speaking, is delightful to the imagination. But such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure, and its beauty, or novelty, or grandeur, will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence. Besides this, the imitative arts, especially poetry, owe much of their effect to a <HI>similar</HI> exhibition of properties quite <HI>foreign</HI> to the imagination; insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems, we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses, or truths discover'd to the understanding, or illustrations of contrivance and final causes, or above all the rest, with circumstances proper to awaken and ingage the passions. It was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify these different species of pleasure; especially that from the passions, which as it is supreme in the noblest works of human genius, so being in some particulars not a little surpri∣zing, gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem, by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance.</P>
<P>After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration, or naturally warm and interest the mind, a pleasure of a very different nature, that which arises from ridicule, came next to be consider'd. As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts, and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers, it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration, and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd. Here too a change of stile became necessary; such a one as might yet be consistent, if possible, with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject: nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind, without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mock-heroic, or the familiar and pointed raillery of profess'd satire; neither of which would have been proper here.</P>
<P>The materials of all imitation being thus laid open, nothing now remain'd but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another, or from the nature of imitation itself. Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
worlds, which is the foundation of metaphor and wit. As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early associations of our ideas, and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life, and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts, it is therefore mention'd here and its effects describ'd. Then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts, and the secondary pleasure, as it is call'd, arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature. After which, the design is clos'd with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination, and on their natural and moral usefulness in life.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece, little can be said with propriety by the author. He had two mo∣dels; that antient and simple one of the first <HI>Graecian</HI> poets, as it is refin'd by <HI>Virgil</HI> in the <HI>Georgics,</HI> and the familiar epistolary way of <HI>Horace.</HI> This latter has several advantages. It admits of a greater variety of stile; it more readily ingages the generality of readers, as partaking more of the air of conversation; and especially with the assistance of rhyme, leads to a closer and more concise expression. Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets, who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy, that the public taste is in a great measure form'd to it alone. Yet, after all, the subject before us tend∣ing almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm, seem'd rather to demand a more open, pathetic and figur'd stile. This too appear'd more natural, as the author's aim was not so much to give formal precepts, or enter into the way of direct argumentation, as by exhibiting the most ingaging prospects of nature, to enlarge and harmonize the imaginati∣on, and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to the same dignity of taste in religion, morals, and civil life. 'Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on; and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the meer external objects of good taste; thus recommending them in common to our natural propenstiy for admiring what is beauti∣ful and lovely. The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as not quite direct to the subject; but since they bear an obvious relation to it, the authority of <HI>Virgil,</HI> the faultless model of didactic poetry, will best support him in this particular. For the sentiments themselves he makes no apology.</P>

Whence it comes to pass, that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination, which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that sur∣rounds us. Let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence, and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects, he will soon acknowledge for what injoyments and pursuits we were destined.

<L>Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown</L>

<L N="235">Of all familiar prospects, tho' beheld<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P> <Q REND="inline"><L>—the neglect</L><L>Of all familiar prospects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q>It is here said, that in consequence of the love of novelty, objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind, lose that effect by repeated attention to them. But the instance of <HI>habit</HI> is oppos'd to this observation; for <HI>there,</HI> objects at first distasteful are in time render'd intirely agreeable by repeated attention.</P>
<P>The difficulty in this case will be remov'd, if we consider, that when objects at first agreeable, lose that influence by frequently recurring, the mind is wholly <HI>pas∣sive</HI> and the perception <HI>involuntary</HI>; but habit, on the other hand. generally supposes <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> accompanying it: so that the pleasure arises here not from the object, but from the mind's <HI>conscious</HI> determination of its own activity; and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination.</P>
<P>It will still be urged perhaps, that a familiarity with disagreeable objects ren∣ders them at length acceptable, even when there is no room for the mind to <HI>resolve</HI> or <HI>act</HI> at all. In this case, the appearance must be accounted for, one of these ways.</P>
<P>The pleasure from habit may be meerly negative. The object at first gave un∣easiness: this uneasinest gradually wears off as the object grows familiar; and the mind finding it at last intirely removed, reckons its situation really pleasura∣ble, compar'd with what it had experienced before.</P>
<P>The dislike conceiv'd of the object at first, might be owing to prejudice or want of attention. Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often, may at length perceive its own mistake, and be reconcil'd to what it had look'd on with aversion. In which case, a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury, by running toward th e other extreme of fondness and attachment.</P>
<P>Or lastly, tho' the object itself should always continue disagreeable, yet cir∣cumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it. Thus an as∣sociation may arise in the mind, and the object never be remember'd without those pleasing circumstances attending it; by which means the disagreeable im∣pression it at first occasion'd will in time be quite obliterated.</P></NOTE></L>

Have you not observ'd that these appearances always co-incide? Virtue, for instance, in the same respect as to which we call it good, is ever acknowledg'd to be beautiful also. In the cha∣racters of men we always</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This the <HI>Athenians</HI> did in a peculiar manner by the words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> <HI>join the two denominations together. The beauty of human bodies corresponds, in like manner, with that oeconomy of parts which constitutes them good; and in all the circumstances which occurr in life, the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good, inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was design'd.</HI> <BIBL>Xenophont. memorab. Socrat. 1. 3. c. 8.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy; <HI>see the Characteristicks,</HI> vol. 2. p. 399. &amp; 422. &amp; vol. 3. p. 181. And his most ingenious disciple has particularly shewn, that it holds in the general laws of nature, in the works of art, and the conduct of the sciences. <HI>Inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue</HI>; <HI>Treat.</HI> 1. §. 8. As to the connection between <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> there are two opinions concerning it. Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature, in consequence of which <HI>all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions, and deformity in the contrary.</HI> And this necessity be∣ing supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding, it follows of course that <HI>beauty</HI> is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>But others there are who believe <HI>beauty</HI> to be meerly a relative and arbitrary thing; that indeed it was a benevolent design in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are <HI>best and most perfect in themselves,</HI> that so we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their <HI>usefulness</HI> from their structure and effects; but that it is not impossible, in a physical sense, that two beings, of equal capacities for <HI>truth,</HI> should perceive, one of them <HI>beauty,</HI> and the other <HI>deformity,</HI> in the same relations. And upon this supposition, by that <HI>truth</HI> which is always connected with <HI>beauty,</HI> nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which, after careful examination, the beauty of that species is found to depend. <HI>Polycletus</HI> for instance, the famous sculptor of <HI>Sicyon,</HI> from an accurate mensu∣ration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies, deduced a canon or system of proportions, which was the rule of all succeeding artists. Suppose a statue modell'd according to this canon. A man of meer natural taste, upon looking at it, without entering into its proportions, confesses and admires its <HI>beauty</HI>; whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head, the neck, or the hand, and, without attending to its beauty, pronounces the work∣manship to be <HI>just</HI> and <HI>true.</HI></P></NOTE></L>

<L N="15">Each muse and each fair science pin'd away</L>
<L>The sordid hours: while foul, barbarian hands</L>

They at∣tempted both the epic ode and satire, and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable, partly allegorical, and partly founded on traditionary legends of the <HI>Saracen</HI> wars. These were the rudiments of the <HI>Italian</HI> poetry. But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous, as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times; such as <HI>Boiardo, Bernardo Tasso, Ariosto,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

It is hardly pos∣sible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the revolu∣tion, when <HI>Locke</HI> stood at the head of one party, and <HI>Dryden</HI> of the other. But the general spirit of liberty, which has ever since been growing, naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion give them with the people, by applying them to subjects of impor∣tance to society. Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable; and philo∣sophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their imbellishments, in order even to gain audience with the public.</P></NOTE></L>

<L N="70"><PB N="50" REF="48"/>
Of adventitious pleasure, which adjoin</L>
<L>Their grateful influence to the prime effect</L>
<L>Of objects grand or beauteous, and inlarge</L>
<L>The complicated joy. The sweets of sense,</L>
<L>Do they not oft with kind accession flow,</L>
<L N="75">To raise harmonious fancy's native charm?</L>
<L>So while we taste the fragrance of the rose,</L>
<L>Glows not her blush the fairer? While we view</L>
<L>Amid the noontide walk a limpid rill</L>
<L>Gush thro' the trickling herbage, to the thirst</L>
<L N="80">Of summer yielding the delicious draught</L>
<L>Of cool refreshment; o'er the mossy brink</L>
<L>Shines not the surface clearer, and the waves</L>
<L>With sweeter music murmur as they flow?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor this alone; the various lot of life</L>
<L N="85">Oft from external circumstance assumes</L>
<L>A moment's disposition to rejoice</L>
<L>In those delights which at a different hour</L>
<L>Would pass unheeded. Fair the face of spring,</L>
<L>When rural songs and odours wake the morn,</L>
<L N="90"><PB N="51" REF="49"/>
To every eye; but how much more to his</L>
<L>Round whom the bed of sickness long diffus'd</L>
<L>Its melancholy gloom! how doubly fair,</L>
<L>When first with fresh-born vigour <HI>he</HI> inhales</L>
<L>The balmy breeze, and feels the blessed sun</L>
<L N="95">Warm at his bosom, from the springs of life</L>
<L>Chasing oppressive damps and languid pain!</L>

<LG>
<L>Or shall I mention, where coelestial truth</L>
<L>Her awful light discloses, to effuse</L>
<L>A more majestic pomp on beauty's frame?</L>
<L N="100">For man loves knowledge, and the beams of truth</L>
<L>More welcome touch his understanding's eye,</L>
<L>Than all the blandishments of sound, his ear,</L>
<L>Than all of taste his tongue. Nor ever yet</L>
<L>The melting rainbow's vernal-tinctur'd hues</L>
<L N="105">To me have shone so pleasing, as when first</L>
<L>The hand of science pointed out the path</L>
<L>In which the sun-beams gleaming from the west</L>

<L>Th' internal surface of each glassy orb</L>
<L>Repells their forward passage into air;</L>
<L N="115">That thence direct they seek the radiant goal</L>
<L>From which their course began; and, as they strike</L>

<L>Of colours changing from the splendid rose</L>
<L N="120">To the pale violet's dejected hue.</L>
</LG>

<L>Or shall we touch that kind access of joy,</L>
<L>That springs to each fair object, while we trace,</L>
<L>Thro' all its fabric, wisdom's artful aim</L>
<L>Disposing every part, and gaining still</L>

<L>The object of its rapture, vast of size,</L>
<L N="140">With fiercer colours and a night of shade?</L>
<L>What? like a storm from their capacious bed</L>
<L>The sounding seas o'erwhelming, when the might</L>

As if a man was never pleas'd in being moved at the distress of a tragedy, with∣out a cool reflection that tho' these fictitious personages were so unhappy, yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety. The ingenious and candid author of the <HI>reflexions critiques sur la poesie &amp; sur la peinture,</HI> accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity, and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and unattentive state: And this, join'd with the moral applause of its own temper, which attends these emotions when natural and just, is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure, which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic, deserved a very particular consideration in this poem.</P></NOTE></L>
<L>Essential pleasure. Passion's fierce illapse</L>

As midnight storms, the scene of human things</L>
<L>Appear'd before me; desarts, burning sands,</L>

<L>Clearer than glass it flow'd. Autumnal spoils</L>
<L>Luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn,</L>
<L N="290">Blush'd o'er the cliffs, whose half-incircling mound</L>
<L>As in a sylvan theatre inclos'd</L>

<L>Inhabitant of earth, to whom is giv'n<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>Inhabitant of earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The account of the oeconomy of providence here introduced, as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind, when under the compunction of private evils, seems to have come originally from the <HI>Pythago∣rean</HI> school: but of all the ancient philosophers, <HI>Plato</HI> has most largely insisted upon it, has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding, and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination. He has one passage so full and clear on the head, that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here, tho' somewhat long. Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine providence, <Q REND="inline"><HI>The being who presides over the whole,</HI> says he, <HI>has dispos'd and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole, every part of which, according to the extent of its influence, does and suffers what is fit and proper. One of these parts is yours, O unhappy man! which tho' in itself most inconsiderable and minute, yet being connected with the universe, ever seeks to co-operate with that supreme order. You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence, that the all-comprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy; existing, as it does, not for your sake, but the cause and reason of your existence, which, as in the symmetry of every artificial work, must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist, and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part. Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless; since according to the various energy of creation, and the common laws of nature, there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole.—For the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and self∣moving creatures, and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them, con∣sidering first of all by what disposition of things, and what situation of each indi∣vidual in the general system, vice might be depressed and subdued, and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible. In this manner he order'd thro' the entire circle of being, the internal constitution of every mind, where should be its station in the universal fabric, and thro' what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence.</HI> He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution, <HI>as well for those who, by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated to the divine virtue, are consequently removed to a place of unblemish'd sanctity and happiness; as of those who by the most flagitious arts have arisen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power, and whom therefore you look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the Gods, because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient, and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole.</HI> <BIBL>Plato de Leg. x. 16.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This theory has been deliver'd of late, especially abroad, in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions; whereas <HI>Plato</HI> appears very careful to preserve it, and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers.</P>

<L>WHAT wonder therefore, since th'indearing ties</L>

As man to man. Nor only where the smiles</L>

<L>On virtue's graceful deeds. For since the course</L>
<L N="15">Of things external acts in different ways</L>
<L>On human apprehensions, as the hand</L>
<L>Of nature temper'd to a different frame</L>
<L>Peculiar minds; so haply where the pow'rs</L>
<L>Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>—where the pow'rs</L><L>Of fancy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy. It were easy by an in∣duction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions, and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure. Let any man, even of the coldest head and soberest industry, analyse the idea of what he calls his interest; he will find that it consists chiefly of certain images of decency, beauty and order, variously combined into one system, the idol which he seeks to injoy by labour, hazard, and self-denial. It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental, whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune; it may be answer'd, that tho' no man is born <HI>ambitious</HI> or a <HI>miser,</HI> yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind, which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects, consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill, and entertain passions of a par∣ticular turn. Some men, for instance, by the original frame of their minds, are more delighted with the vast and magnificent, others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature. And it is very remarkable, that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination; that those who are most inclin'd to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world, are also most inclin'd to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral. While those who are charm'd rather with the <HI>deli∣cacy</HI> and <HI>sweetness</HI> of colours, and forms, and sounds, never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a dome∣stic life. And this is sufficient to account for the objection.</P>
<P>Among the ancient philosophers, tho' we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the <HI>Socratic</HI> school, yet the <HI>Stoics</HI> were the first who paid it a due attention. <HI>Zeno,</HI> their founder, thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life, without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the imagina∣tion offers to the mind. (<HI>Diog. Laert. l.</HI> vii.) The meditations of <HI>M. Aurelius,</HI> and the discourses of <HI>Epictetus,</HI> are full of the same sentiments; insomuch that this latter makes the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>right management of the fancys,</HI> the only thing for which we are accountable to providence, and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic. <HI>Arrian. l.</HI> i. <HI>c.</HI> 12. &amp; <HI>l.</HI> ii. <HI>c.</HI> 22.

<L><PB N="91" REF="89"/>
Their genuine hues, the features which they wore</L>
<L>In nature; there opinion will be true,</L>
<L>And action right. For action treads the path</L>
<L>In which opinion says he follows good,</L>
<L N="25">Or flies from evil; and opinion gives</L>
<L>Report of good or evil, as the scene</L>
<L>Was drawn by fancy, lovely or deform'd:</L>
<L>Thus her report can never there be true,</L>
<L>Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye,</L>
<L N="30"><PB N="92" REF="90"/>
With glaring colours and distorted lines.</L>
<L>Is there a man, who at the sound of death,</L>
<L>Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur'd up,</L>
<L>And black before him; nought but death-bed groans,</L>
<L>And fearful pray'rs, and plunging from the brink</L>
<L N="35">Of light and being, down the gloomy air,</L>
<L>An unknown depth? Alas! in such a mind,</L>
<L>If no bright forms of excellence attend</L>
<L>The image of his country; nor the pomp</L>
<L>Of sacred senates, nor the guardian voice</L>
<L N="40">Of justice on her throne, nor aught that wakes</L>
<L>The conscious bosom with a patriot's flame;</L>
<L>Will not opinion tell him, that to die,</L>
<L>Or stand the hazard, is a greater ill</L>
<L>Than to <HI>betray</HI> his country? And in act</L>
<L N="45">Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live?</L>
<L>Here vice begins then. From th' inchanting cup</L>
<L>Which fancy holds to all, th' unwary thirst</L>
<L>Of youth oft swallows a Circaean draught,</L>
<L>That sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eye</L>
<L N="50">Of reason, till no longer he discerns,</L>
<L><PB N="93" REF="91"/>
And only guides to err. Then revel forth</L>
<L>A furious band that spurn him from the throne;</L>
<L>And all is uproar. Thus ambition grasps</L>
<L>The empire of the soul: thus pale revenge</L>
<L N="55">Unsheaths her murd'rous dagger; and the hands</L>

Suffice it to have said,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>—suffice it to have said, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other, and examining the ridiculous in other objects, we may obtain a general definition of it equally applicable to every species. The most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referr'd to; but others more minute we shall subjoin here. <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s account of the matter seems both imperfect and false; <Q REND="inline"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says he, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: <HI>the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpi∣tude without pain, and not destructive to its subject.</HI> <BIBL>(<HI>Poetic. c.</HI> v.)</BIBL></Q> For allow∣ing it to be true, as it is not, that the ridiculous is never accompany'd with pain, yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous. So that the definition does not distinguish the thing defined. Nay farther, even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject, we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance, till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds. For the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas; but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception. So that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement, and yet not feel the ridiculous, because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion. Thus it hap∣pens that some men think those objects ridiculous, to which others cannot endure to apply the name; because in them they excite a much intenser and more im∣portant feeling. And this difference, among other causes, has brought a good deal of confusion into this question.</P>
<P><HI>That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances, comparatively worthless or de∣formed; or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful: the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate; belonging always to the same order or class of being, implying sentiment or design; and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart.</HI></P>
<P>To prove the several parts of this definition: <HI>The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed,</HI> is ri∣diculous; for instance, pompous pretensions to wisdom join'd with ignorance and folly in the <HI>Socrates</HI> of <HI>Aristophanes</HI>; and the applause of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the <HI>Thraso</HI> of <HI>Terence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable,</HI> is also ridiculous: for instance, the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station.</P>
<P><HI>The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves, or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate:</HI> in the last-mention'd instances they both exist in the objects; in the instance from <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> one of them is objective and real, the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character.</P>
<P><HI>The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being.</HI> A coxcomb in fine cloaths bedaubed by accident in foul weather, is a ridiculous object; because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referr'd to the splendour and expence of his dress. A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances, is not counted ridiculous; because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him, is, both in fact and in his own apprehension, of a very different species.</P>
<P><HI>Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design.</HI> A column placed by an architect without a capital or base, is laugh'd at: the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation.</P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart,</HI> such as terror, pity, or indignation; for in that case, as was observ'd above, the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous.</P>
<P>Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description, and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous, must be deter∣mined by repeated applications of it to particular instances.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Ask we for what fair end,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>Ask we for what fair end, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a <HI>natural</HI> sense or feeling of the ridiculous, and since so good a reason may be assign'd to justify the supreme being for bestowing it; one cannot without astonish∣ment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction, and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause. Ridicule is not concerned with meer speculative truth or falsehood. It is not in abstract propositions or theorems, but in actions and passions, good and evil, beauty and deformity, that we find mate∣rials for it; and all these terms are <HI>relative,</HI> implying approbation or blame. To ask then <HI>whether ridicule be a test of truth,</HI> is, in other words, to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be <HI>morally true,</HI> can be just and becoming; or whether that which is just and becoming, can be ridiculous. A question that does not deserve a serious answer. For it is most evident, that as in a metaphysical pro∣position offer'd to the understanding for its assent, the faculty of reason exa∣mines the terms of the proposition, and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another, to be in fact unequal, of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood: so in objects offer'd to the mind for its esteem or applause, the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim, urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt. When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind, and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of public, it is our business, if the matter be of importance to society, to drag out those latent circumstances, and by setting them full in view, convince the world how ridiculous the claim is; and thus a double advantage is gained; for we both detect the <HI>moral falsehood</HI> sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry, and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors. And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule.</P>
<P>But it is said, the practice is dangerous, and may be inconsistent with the re∣gard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence. I answer, the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous; men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object, and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us; but the sense of ridicule always judges right: the <HI>Socrates</HI> of <HI>Aristophanes</HI> is as <HI>truly</HI> ridiculous a character as ever was drawn.—True; but it is not the character of <HI>Socrates,</HI> the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom. What then? did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character, and thus rendering the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn? No: but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people. And so has the reasoning of <HI>Spinoza</HI> made many atheists; he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false, but allow him these, and his con∣clusions are unavoidably true. And if we must reject the use of ridicule, be∣cause by the imposition of false circumstances, things may be made to seem ridiculous, which are not so in themselves; why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason, because by proceeding on false principles, conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature, let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine.</P></NOTE> th' almighty sire</L>

<L>Condemns the fair inchantment. On, my strain,</L>
<L>Perhaps ev'n now some cold, fastidious judge</L>
<L N="445"><PB N="116" REF="114"/>
Casts a disdainful eye; and calls my toil,</L>
<L>And calls the love and beauty which I sing,</L>
<L>The dream of folly. Thou grave censor! say,</L>
<L>Is beauty then a dream, because the glooms</L>
<L>Of dullness hang too heavy on thy sense</L>
<L N="450">To let her shine upon thee? So the man</L>
<L>Whose eye ne'er open'd on the light of heav'n,</L>
<L>Might smile with scorn while raptur'd vision tells</L>
<L>Of the gay, colour'd radiance flushing bright</L>
<L>O'er all creation. From the wise be far</L>
<L N="455">Such gross, unhallow'd pride; nor needs my song</L>
<L>Descend so low; but rather now unfold,</L>
<L>If human thought could reach, or words unfold,</L>
<L>By what mysterious fabric of the mind,</L>
<L>The deep-felt joys and harmony of sound</L>
<L N="460">Result from airy motion; and from shape</L>
<L>The lovely phantoms of sublime and fair.</L>
<L>By what fine ties hath GOD connected things</L>
<L>When present in the mind; which in themselves</L>
<L>Have no connection? Sure the rising sun,</L>
<L N="465">O'er the caerulean convex of the sea,</L>
<L>With equal brightness and with equal warmth</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="115"/>
Might rowl his fiery orb; nor yet the soul</L>
<L>Thus feel her frame expanded, and her pow'rs</L>
<L>Exulting in the splendor she beholds;</L>
<L N="470">Like a young conqu'ror moving thro' the pomp</L>
<L>Of some triumphal day. When join'd at eve,</L>
<L>Soft-murm'ring streams and gales of gentlest breath</L>
<L>Melodious Philomela's wakeful strain</L>
<L>Attemper, could not man's discerning ear</L>
<L N="475">Thro' all its tones the symphony pursue;</L>
<L>Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joy</L>
<L>Steal thro' his veins and fan th'awaken'd heart,</L>
<L>Mild as the breeze, yet rapt'rous as the song?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But were not nature still indow'd at large</L>
<L N="480">With all which life requires, tho' unadorn'd</L>
<L>With such inchantment? Wherefore then her form</L>
<L>So exquisitely fair? her breath perfum'd</L>
<L>With such aethereal sweetness? Whence her voice</L>
<L>Inform'd at will to raise or to depress</L>
<L N="485">Th' impassion'd soul? and whence the robes of light</L>
<L>Which thus invest her with more lovely pomp</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="116"/>
Than fancy can describe? Whence but from thee,</L>
<L>O source divine of ever-flowing love,</L>
<L>And thy unmeasur'd goodness? Not content</L>
<L N="490">With every food of life to nourish man,</L>
<L>By kind illusions of the wond'ring sense</L>
<L>Thou mak'st all nature beauty to his eye,</L>
<L>Or music to his ear: well-pleas'd he scans</L>
<L>The goodly prospect; and with inward smiles</L>
<L N="495">Treads the gay verdure of the painted plain;</L>
<L>Beholds the azure canopy of heav'n,</L>
<L>And living lamps that over-arch his head</L>
<L>With more than regal splendor; bends his ears</L>
<L>To the full choir of water, air, and earth;</L>
<L N="500">Nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought,</L>
<L>Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch,</L>
<L>Nor questions more the music's mingling sounds</L>
<L>Than space, or motion, or eternal time:</L>
<L>So sweet he feels their influence to attract</L>
<L N="505">The fixed soul; to brighten the dull glooms</L>
<L>Of care, and make the destin'd road of life</L>
<L>Delightful to his feet. So fables tell,</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="117"/>
Th' advent'rous heroe, bound on hard exploits,</L>
<L>Beholds with glad surprize, by secret spells</L>
<L N="510">Of some kind sage, the patron of his toils,</L>
<L>A visionary paradise disclos'd</L>
<L>Amid the dubious wild: with streams, and shades,</L>
<L>And airy songs, th' enchanted landscape smiles,</L>
<L>Chears his long labours and renews his frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="515">What then is taste, but these internal pow'rs</L>
<L>Active, and strong, and feelingly alive</L>
<L>To each fine impulse? a discerning sense</L>
<L>Of decent and sublime, with quick disgust</L>
<L>From things deform'd, or disarrang'd, or gross</L>
<L N="520">In species? This, nor gems, nor stores of gold,</L>
<L>Nor purple state, nor culture can bestow;</L>
<L>But GOD alone, when first his active hand</L>
<L>Imprints the secret byass of the soul.</L>
<L>He, mighty parent! wise and just in all,</L>
<L N="525">Free as the vital breeze or light of heav'n,</L>
<L>Reveals the charms of nature. Ask the swain</L>
<L>Who journeys homeward from a summer day's</L>
<L>Long labour, why, forgetful of his toils</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="118"/>
And due repose, he loiters to behold</L>
<L N="530">The sunshine gleaming as thro' amber clouds,</L>
<L>O'er all the western sky; full soon, I ween,</L>
<L>His rude expression and untutor'd airs,</L>
<L>Beyond the pow'r of language, will unfold</L>
<L>The form of beauty smiling at his heart,</L>
<L N="535">How lovely! how commanding! But tho' heav'n</L>
<L>In every breast hath sown these early seeds</L>
<L>Of love and admiration, yet in vain,</L>
<L>Without fair culture's kind parental aid,</L>
<L>Without inlivening suns, and genial show'rs,</L>
<L N="540">And shelter from the blast, in vain we hope</L>
<L>The tender plant should rear its blooming head,</L>
<L>Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring.</L>
<L>Nor yet will every soil with equal stores</L>
<L>Repay the tiller's labour; or attend</L>
<L N="545">His will, obsequious, whether to produce</L>
<L>The olive or the laurel. Diff'rent minds</L>
<L>Incline to different objects: one pursues</L>
<L>The vast alone, the wonderful, the wild;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>—One pursues</L>
<L>The vast alone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> See the note to ver. 18 of this book.</P></NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="121" REF="119"/>
Another sighs for harmony, and grace,</L>
<L N="550">And gentlest beauty. Hence when lightning fires</L>
<L>The arch of heav'n, and thunders rock the ground;</L>
<L>When furious whirlwinds rend the howling air,</L>
<L>And ocean, groaning from the lowest bed,</L>
<L>Heaves his tempestuous billows to the sky;</L>
<L>Amid the mighty uproar, while below</L>
<L N="555">The nations tremble, Shakespear looks abroad</L>
<L>From some high cliff, superior, and enjoys</L>
<L>The elemental war. But Waller longs,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>Waller longs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q>
<Q><L>O! how I long my careless limbs to lay</L>
<L>Under the plantane shade; and all the day</L>
<L>With am'rous airs my fancy entertain, &amp;c.</L>
<BIBL>WALLER, Battle of the Summer-Islands. Canto I.</BIBL></Q>
And again,

<L>All on the margin of some flow'ry stream</L>
<L N="560">To spread his careless limbs amid the cool</L>
<L>Of plantane shades, and to the list'ning deer,</L>
<L>The tale of slighted vows and love's disdain</L>
<L>Resound soft-warbling all the live-long day:</L>
<L>Consenting Zephyr sighs; the weeping rill</L>
<L N="565"><PB N="122" REF="120"/>
Joins in his plaint, melodious; mute the groves;</L>
<L>And hill and dale with all their echoes mourn.</L>
<L>Such and so various are the tastes of men.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! blest of heav'n, whom not the languid songs</L>
<L>Of luxury, the Siren! not the bribes</L>
<L N="570">Of sordid wealth, nor all the gaudy spoils</L>
<L>Of pageant honour can seduce to leave</L>
<L>Those ever-blooming sweets, which from the store</L>
<L>Of nature fair imagination culls</L>
<L>To charm th' inliven'd soul! What tho' not all</L>
<L N="575">Of mortal offspring can attain the heights</L>
<L>Of envied life; tho' only few possess</L>
<L>Patrician treasures or imperial state;</L>
<L>Yet nature's care, to all her children just,</L>
<L>With richer treasures and an ampler state</L>
<L N="580">Indows at large whatever happy man</L>
<L>Will deign to use them. His the city's pomp,</L>
<L>The rural honours his. Whate'er adorns</L>
<L>The princely dome, the column and the arch,</L>
<L>The breathing marbles and the sculptur'd gold,</L>

Beyond the proud possessor's narrow claim,</L>
<L>His tuneful breast injoys. For him, the spring</L>
<L>Distills her dews, and from the silken gem</L>
<L>Its lucid leaves unfolds: for him, the hand</L>
<L>Of autumn tinges every fertile branch</L>
<L N="590">With blooming gold and blushes like the morn.</L>
<L>Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings;</L>
<L>And still new beauties meet his lonely walk;</L>
<L>And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><L>—Not a breeze, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</L></Q> That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy, it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest, wisest, and best of men on this article; one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case, that he reckons it among those favours for which he was especially thankful to the gods, that they had not suf∣fered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry, lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station. Speaking of the beauty of universal nature, he observes that <Q REND="inline"><HI>there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive,</HI></Q> when once we consider its connection with that general order. He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities, and then adds, <Q REND="inline"><HI>that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order—will discern many amiable things, not credible to every mind, but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with nature and her works.</HI> <BIBL>M.

Fresh pleasure, unreprov'd. Nor thence partakes</L>
<L>Fresh pleasure only: for th' attentive mind,</L>
<L N="600">By this harmonious action on her pow'rs,</L>
<L>Becomes herself harmonious: wont so long</L>
<L>In outward things to meditate the charm</L>
<L>Of sacred order, soon she seeks at home</L>
<L>To find a kindred order, to exert</L>
<L N="605">Within herself this elegance of love,</L>
<L>This fair-inspir'd delight: her temper'd pow'rs</L>
<L>Refine at length, and every passion wears</L>
<L>A chaster, milder, more attractive mien.</L>
<L>But if to ampler prospects, if to gaze</L>
<L N="610">On nature's form where negligent of all</L>
<L>These lesser graces, she assumes the port</L>
<L>Of that eternal majesty that weigh'd</L>
<L>The world's foundations, if to these the mind</L>
<L>Exalt her daring eye; then mightier far</L>
<L N="615">Will be the change, and nobler. Would the forms</L>
<L>Of servile custom cramp her generous pow'rs?</L>
<L>Would sordid policies, the barb'rous growth</L>
<L>Of ignorance and rapine, bow her down</L>
<L><PB N="125" REF="123"/>
To tame pursuits, to indolence and fear?</L>
<L N="620">Lo! she appeals to nature, to the winds</L>
<L>And rowling waves, the sun's unwearied course,</L>
<L>The elements and seasons: all declare</L>
<L>For what th' eternal maker has ordain'd</L>
<L>The pow'rs of man: we feel within ourselves</L>
<L N="625">His energy divine: he tells the heart,</L>
<L>He meant, he made us to behold and love</L>
<L>What he beholds and loves, the general orb</L>
<L>Of life and being; to be great like him,</L>
<L>Beneficent and active. Thus the men</L>
<L N="630">Whom nature's works can charm, with GOD himself</L>
<L>Hold converse; grow familiar, day by day,</L>
<L>With his conceptions; act upon his plan;</L>
<L>And form to his, the relish of their souls.</L>
