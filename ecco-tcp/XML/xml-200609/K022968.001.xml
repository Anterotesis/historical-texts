<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HOWEVER sparing modern Authors
are in giving due praise to their Cotempora∣ries,
they seem to be more united in acknow∣ledging
the merit of those who, to use the
language of the Psalmist, <Q REND="inline">"have ceased from
their labours."</Q> Writers, whose works have
stood the test of years, have acquired a kind
of prescriptive title to celebrity, not on ac∣count
of that superior wisdom which is often
attributed to times we have survived, or the
supposed degeneracy of the present, but be∣cause,
what has been long known has been
more reflected upon, and what undergoes this
examination is better understood.</P>
<P>In the catalogue of Authors, whose wri∣tings
have met with public reception, none
have been more justly celebrated than those
of POPE, and <HI>his Cotemporaries</HI>; insomuch,
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
that their names have not only been honour∣ably
recorded, but the period in which they
lived has been pre-eminently distinguished by
the title of the <HI>Augustan Age.</HI> Other points
of time have here and there given birth to
a great genius, who, like a leading star, has
enlightened the horizon of literature, but no
particular aera, at least of our history, has
produced so general, and collected a light as
this; a light which, at once, shone upon every
part of science, at the same time that it il∣luminated
the circle of morality.</P>
<P>What could have been the cause why such
a cluster of great men flourished at the same
period of time, and why we have had no similar
succession ever since? Whether the first arose
from the emulation of authorship, which, like
the collision of hard bodies, struck a fire from
each other, or that the latter was occasioned
by the number of finished pieces they gave
to the world, which has ever since occasioned
a kind of literary satiety, is a question, per∣haps,
not so readily decided. This however
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
is as generally known, as assented to, that
from the very few eminent geniuses who
have arisen since the flourishing days of this
illustrious Junto, nature seems to have in∣dulged
herself in a temporary repose.</P>
<P>When Authors, therefore, have thus long
engaged the public attention, when their
works are read with avidity, and universally
receive a classical stamp, those who can add
any thing to their illustration, and recover
by time what has eluded former diligence,
bring an acceptable present to the public.
It is with good Authors as with good men;
the nearer, and more intimately they are
viewed, the more we are able to set a proper
value upon their characters, and look up to
them as more enforcing examples of imitation
and instruction.</P>
<P>Under this idea, the Editor thinks he need
make no apology in presenting the public
with two additional volumes to the Works of
Mr. POPE, which contain such of that celebrated
Bard's pieces, in prose and verse, together with
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
many of his Cotemporaries, as for particular
and local reasons were then suppressed, might
have been mislaid, or perhaps got into too
remote hands to be collected with ease. He
is aware, at the same time, that the public
rage for the remains of celebrated men, has
occasioned many spurious productions being
fathered on them, under the well-known titles
of <HI>second parts,</HI> and <HI>posthumous works.</HI> Our
best Authors, and principally our best, have
been subject to such impositions, which, tho'
they have been in time detected, have yet
answered the illiberal purposes of such a tem∣porary
publication. The Editor of the pre∣sent
Work, to get clear of the shadow of
an imputation in this line, is the first to
remind the public, that several of the pieces
here exhibited originally appeared in <HI>The St.
James's Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>The favourable reception they met with
in that fugitive mode of publication, first
suggested to him a wish to give them a more
durable form; he accordingly communicated
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
this wish to his friends, who assisted him in
his design, so much beyond his expectation,
that instead of <HI>one</HI> volume (his original in∣tention)
he has, by their favour, been able
to make out <HI>two</HI>; composed of such materials,
as he flatters himself will acquit him of the
charge of an hasty, or self-interested compiler.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Poems,</HI> of which
this publication consists, were transcribed
with accuracy from the originals, in the
collections of the late Lords Oxford and
Bolingbroke, who are well known to have
lived in the strictest intimacy with Mr. POPE,
as well as his literary friends and associates.
Some of the <HI>latter</HI> will be found no way in∣ferior
to other productions of the same Au∣thors.
All of the fragments, more or less,
carry the marks of a master. Others of the
Letters are taken from pamphlets printed
some years ago, which, in the detached man∣ner
they then appeared, will, it is to be hoped,
fully justify their present mode of publica∣tion.
They, for the most part, treat of cri∣tical,
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
friendly, humorous, and literary sub∣jects,
and abstracted from these, throw new
lights upon the character of Mr. POPE, as a
man.</P>
<P>His Letters to his favourite Miss Blount
lead to the support of a charge often urged
against him — <HI>his want of original inven∣tion</HI>;
for tho' the extent of his erudition, and
his elegant turn of thinking, gave him a
superiority to all his Cotemporaries in polishing,
to a degree of <HI>originality,</HI> other people's sen∣timents;
yet here, whether from the careless∣ness
arising from intimate friendship, idleness,
or the supposition of his not being detected
by his fair correspondent, he has committed
a plagiarism on Voiture, which would be un∣worthy
a much less celebrated pen than his.</P>
<P>His Letter to Jabez Hughes, Esq. brother
to the author of the Siege of Damascus, with
that of his to Mr. Dennis, the critic, are
melancholy proofs that the greatest genius
cannot always shield men from duplicity of
conduct in their literary characters, and bring
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
another corroboration to the testimony of
Gay's assertion, that
<Q><L>"Wits are game-cocks to each other."</L></Q>
But if these Letters shew the weaknesses,
perhaps the inseparable weaknesses from hu∣man
nature, others will shew some of its
fairest, and brightest sides; they will exhibit
the strongest <HI>traits</HI> of his humanity and
friendship, his wit, his learning, and his
morals; they will confirm his more than
Roman affection to his parents, and parti∣cularly
to his aged mother, whose life he
watched over with such soothing solicitude
and exemplary reverence, as force us for a
while to turn from the lustre of his talents to
admire the superiority of his silial character.</P>
<P>A few Poems and Letters will be found
in this collection, which appeared only in
some of the editions of his works, in none
of them quite perfect, which are particularly
distinguished in the latter, by the additional
paragraphs being printed in Italics. This will
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
justify their republication here, more parti∣cularly
as many of them are written in that
unreserved, open manner, which his original
Editor might have a wish to conceal for many
reasons, that now no longer remain; at pre∣sent,
the restoration of them can neither in∣dulge
vanity, nor gratify spleen: they may be
read without any other reason than the desire
of pleasure, and are therefore only to be
praised as that object is obtained.</P>
<P>To many, in an age like this, where
hypocrisy in morals is much practised, (as
is shewn by our dramatic, and other writers,)
perhaps a few of the Poems may appear
too loose and descriptive, particularly "The
Farewel to London," the conclusion of the
"Address to Miss Blount on leaving Town,"
and some passages in "The Sober Advice
from Horace, &amp;c." by Mr. POPE; together
with the Poem called "Virtue in Danger," and
others by Lady Mary Wortley Montague: but
on a proper examination this charge of in∣decency
will be found to lie more in the
readers turn of thinking, than the defects of
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
the writer. A poet who wants to give his sub∣ject
due force, should comply with the rules
of his profession, by using <Q REND="inline">"proper words in
proper places,"</Q> and provided he keeps a
steady eye on the moral of his piece, the more
he colours from nature, the more he assists
his design, whilst the <HI>hint</HI> and <HI>double entendrez,</HI>
those mock draperies of delicacy, often create
a more indecent meaning than the circum∣stance
will allow, and urge the young and in∣experienced
reader more to the exercise of his
passions than his reason.</P>
<P>Swift's delicacy has been often arraigned
on the same principle; and his "Lady's
Dressing Room," and others of his Poems
of a similar stamp, are ever sure to be ad∣duced
as convincing proofs of this charge.
But where is the woman of real sense and
cleanliness offended at it? Conscious she de∣serves
no such reprehension in her own con∣duct,
she sees the general force of the satire
only directed to the slatterns of her sex, and
is pleased with the hope of a consequent
reformation. In short, the Editor is entirely
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
of opinion, that the same rule respecting
decency, which a modern artist has laid down
in painting, will equally hold good in poetry.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It is not in shewing, or concealing the
naked, that modesty or lewdness depend.
They arise entirely from the choice and
intentions of the artist himself. A great
mind can raise great, or pleasing ideas,
though he shews all the parts of the body
in their natural way, whilst the Cheapside
prints of the <HI>Buck and Quaker Girl,</HI> the
charms of the <HI>Garter</HI> and <HI>High-wind,</HI> are
proofs that very lewd ideas might be pro∣duced,
though little or nothing of the
naked be discovered; and there is no doubt,
but that the <HI>Venus De Medicis</HI> might be
converted into a very lewd figure <HI>by dressing
her out for that purpose</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Barry on the Arts.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>The letters which passed between Mr.
POPE, and his booksellers, which are to be
found in the second of these volumes, may
appear to those who are to be no otherwise
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
pleased with human genius than seeing it
eternally on the stretch, rather too trisling;
and as the public voice is not a little raised
upon like occasions, the Editor thinks it
may be necessary to say something on this
subject.</P>
<P>It is objected, that most of our great wri∣ters
no sooner establish a reputation for their
works, but there are never wanting interested
people, who preferring a private lucre either
to the fame of the author, or national honour,
busy themselves in gleaning up their most un∣interesting
thoughts on the most uninteresting
subjects; such as letters to tradesmen, &amp;c.
and that kind of domestic correspondence,
which, to use the language of a modern au∣thor,
<Q REND="inline">"a wise man should be ashamed to re∣member."</Q></P>
<P>Was a collection of this kind purposely
made for the filling up a volume without the
least regard to amusement, curiosity, or in∣struction,
it must soon defeat its own pur∣poses;
for, however common readers may for
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
a while be pleased with the novelty, the re∣probation
it must receive from men of sense,
would soon distinguish it as the <HI>mortal part</HI> of
an author, and in this state consign it to ob∣livion.
But trifling as these Letters ap∣pear
to be, many of them referring to literary
business, help to settle dates, and explain re∣ferences,
which perhaps before were not quite
so intelligible, and like those well digested
questions on a legal examination, which how∣ever
simple they may appear in respect to
their immediate enquiries are yet important, as
they strengthen, or elucidate a fact in their
connections. Others will serve to shew the
degree of intimacy between the poet and book∣seller
of that time, the process of publica∣tion,
and many other little anecdotes of par∣ties
and places, too <HI>trifling</HI> to be otherwise
recorded, but by this mode of preservation,
and yet too <HI>curious</HI> (at least to literary enqui∣rers)
to fall down the stream of obscurity.</P>
<P>The Editor having now made those apo∣logies
which he thought necessary for offering
these volumes to the public, he will no longer
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
detain them from the exercise of their own
judgement. He cannot, however, conclude
without assuring them that his design in this
compilation was no more than to collect in one
view, such pieces of our celebrated English
Bard, and his Cotemporaries, as may be lost
to the world from a fugitive mode of pub∣lication,
and others which might be equally
lost from their being only open to the inspec∣tion
of the few. In this, as he has spared
no industry, or expence himself, and stands
much indebted to the researches and interest
of many of his friends, he hopes to have
the merit of a faithful and useful Com∣piler,
and that these volumes may not be
thought improper appendages to the present
edition of POPE'S WORKS.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all kinds of poetry the Didascalic is the most
valuable, if aiming at the good of mankind be what
justly entitles any thing to that character. The de∣scriptive
kind is like a fine landskip, where you meet
with two or three principal figures; the rest is all
rocks, rivulets, hanging woods and verdant lawns,
amusing to the eye, shewing the taste of the painter,
but carrying little instruction along with it. But
the Didascalic is like a curious piece of history paint∣ing,
where every figure must be highly wrought,
every passion strongly represented, all contributing in
their several degrees to express the main design; in
short, it must be a finished piece.</P>
<P>That this is a very difficult work may be collected
from the small number of those poets who have ever
attempted it. In the early ages of the Grecians, I
remember none who have wrote any thing in this way
but old Hesiod, Aratus, and Nicander; for Diony∣sius,
the Periegetic, and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agesilaus, Oppian's father, was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power, in the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia, where he liv'd: Severus making a progress, came to that town, and Agesilaus being not at the procession to meet the Emperor at his entrance, probably on account of his age and infirmities, that prince, to punish him for so heinous a crime, banish'd the poor old man to Malta. Oppian, to amuse his father under his misfortune, took to writing of poetry, and after∣wards dedicated his Halieutics to the Emperor's son. The Emperor was so pleas'd with the poem, that he or∣der'd him a piece of gold for each line, and offer'd him any other favour he would ask. The first part of the story is not at all wonderful, but I must confess the last part is a little surprizing.</NOTE> Oppian, liv'd not 'till the
<PB N="60" REF="79"/>
time of the Roman Emperors. Hesiod's works and
days is the only piece remaining that is allow'd to be
genuine without dispute; but by Virgil's, and especi∣ally
Manilius's compliments to him, 'tis highly pro∣bable
he wrote others, and perhaps more valuable
ones, tho' Quintilian allows him the <HI>Palma in illo
medio genere dicendi</HI> only, and Le Fevre is much more
hard upon him when he makes him little better than
an almanack-maker, and his work a mean perform∣ance.
Paterculus and Plutarch set him next to
Homer, as well in the value of his works, as in the
period of his age, says Mr. Kennet; but perhaps that
may be the other extreme. Aratus wrote a poem, in
two books, which he calls the Phaenomena, and
Diosemeia, the one astronomical, giving an account
of the situation and the affection of the heavenly
bodies, the other astrological, shewing the particular
influences arising from their various dispositions and
relations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Kennet's lives of the Greek poets.</NOTE>. Tully commends him for his versifica∣tion,
<PB N="61" REF="80"/>
and Quintilian says, he has fully answer'd his
argument, which put together, should make up a
pretty good character. As to Nicander, Vossius
places him amongst his Greek historians, but allows
him to have been <HI>egregius grammaticus, poeta, &amp;

medicus.</HI> His surviving works are, however, only
poetry upon poisons, and the methods of cure for
them. Of the two latter Greek poets, Dionysius
and Oppian, the one wrote a survey of the world,
and the other Cynegetics and Halieutics, in both which
'tis certain there are very fine parts, however judg∣ments
may differ about them.</P>
<P>Amongst the Romans, Lucretius and Manilius
may justly be said to be the chief of the Didascalic
poets. They both wrote with all the fire of their
youth about 'em; for neither of them liv'd to be old.
I have always fancy'd Manilius imitated Lucretius in
his manner, the beginning of his books being pretty
much in the same way, besides, that he loses no oc∣casion
of launching out into descriptions, and is
florid to a fault. He has likewise some reflections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The beginning of the fourth book.</NOTE> on
the follies of men, so very much of a piece with what
you meet with in the 5th book of Lucretius, that one
would almost think them taken from thence. In
general it may be said, they are both very noble poems,
tho' that of Manilius is far from being finish'd, as it
might have been, if the author had liv'd. What
errors are to be found in the philosophy of the one,
<PB N="62" REF="81"/>
and the astronomy of the other, are owing, perhaps,
as much to the age of the world at that time, as
their own, and their beauties may, in some measure,
atone for their faults.</P>
<P>Virgil's Georgics are in the same kind, tho' the
subjects are of less dignity; and I don't know whe∣ther
I might not likewise add Ovid, on the account
of his Fasti, the most correct of all his works:
Gratius too, about the same time, wrote his Cynege∣tics,
which are very justly esteem'd.</P>
<P>Amongst the moderns, Fracastorius's <HI>Syphilis,</HI> Quil∣let's
<HI>Callipaedia,</HI> and Vida's Art of Poetry, are the
best poems of this sort; Rapin of gardens, and
Vanier's <HI>Praedium Rusticum,</HI> are not without their
merit, but much inferior to the others. In our own
language too we have some poems of this instructive
kind: The Essays on Poetry, Translated Verse, and
Criticism, are fine instances of the worth and excel∣lency
of this manner of writing, to which may be
very truly apply'd what Dr. Young says of Satyr,<Q><L>" Heroes and gods make other poems fine,</L>
<L>" Plain satyr calls for sense in every line<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Universal Passion, Sat. II.</NOTE>."</L></Q> The strength of just observations, convey'd in smooth
and flowing numbers, has a prevailing influence,
insinuates itself into the mind almost imperceptibly,
and makes a more lasting impression there than one
would easily imagine. 'Tis true these subjects are
purely critical, and so of less consequence to man∣kind
<PB N="63" REF="82"/>
in general; but yet, polishing the understand∣ing,
improving the judgment, and regulating the
taste, are far from being things indifferent to the
world, since they tend not a little to the shaming
out of it that rusticity and barbarism, those follies
and affectations, in one word, all that littleness of
mind which is so effectual a bar in the way of ge∣nerous
and noble undertakings. But we have had of
late an undeniable proof that the finest and most use∣ful
sort of philosophy, which consists in the know∣ledge
of ourselves, may be convey'd in such clear,
strong, easy, and affecting strains, at the same time
convincing and captivating the understanding, that
there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands
of a great genius, may be made as beneficial as ever
it has been entertaining to mankind. The latter
effect is indeed what has been generally most aim'd at,
as it is compass'd with less difficulty to the writer, and
meets with a more universal reception amongst the
common sort of readers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Nec in turbam nec turbae carmina condam.</L>
<BIBL>MANIL. L. II.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> Imagery, fine colour∣ing,
and bright antitheses, often disguise the want of
justness and force, and by pleasing the imagination,
do, as it were, steal away from the judgment, or
sometimes impose upon it, as shadows pass for sub∣stances
with weak, distemper'd or fanciful men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Os magna sonaturum</HI> of Horace would make
one almost think the muse must never appear without
<PB N="64" REF="83"/>
her buskins, and that all simplicity of expression were
to be totally banish'd out of poetical writings. 'Tis
true, the Epic Poem, the Ode, and the Tragedy very
often require, and consequently justify the use of ele∣vated
language, as it may be more suitable to the
greatness of the subjects, and better fitted to raise the
several passions they are design'd to work upon. But
where the appeal lies only to the understanding, self∣evident
truths, naturally and beautifully express'd, can
never fail of the approbation of a sound head and a
good taste: And even Horace himself, as elevated
and great a poet as he must be allow'd in his <HI>Odes,</HI>
appears to much more advantage in his <HI>Sermones</HI> and
<HI>Epistles,</HI> where, as my Lord Roscommon observes on
another occasion,<Q><L>" Fancy labours less, but judgment more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill has met with
universal applause, tho' its subject seems rather de∣scriptive
than instructing; but 'tis not the hill, the
river, nor the stag chace; 'tis the good sense and the
fine reflections so frequently interspers'd, and as it were
interwoven with the rest, that gives it the value, and
will make it, as was said of true wit, everlasting like
the sun.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Prior's Solomon seems to have cost
him much time and pains, and was, I believe, his
favourite performance: He is in some doubt whe∣ther
to call it a Didascalic or Heroic poem. It has,
<PB N="65" REF="84"/>
indeed, something of both, and yet strictly speaking,
is perfectly neither: It has not fable, machinery,
nor variety enough to be an Heroic poem, and it is
too diffusive and luxuriant in the style, too florid
and full of descriptions to be of the Didascalic sort.
In general, it may be justly said to be a very fine
piece; though I must confess I cannot help giving the
preference to his Alma, in which the design is more
closely pursued, carried on with more spirit, and
never loses your attention.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, what Mr. Dryden has said in the
preface to his <HI>Religio Laici,</HI> is, I think, very true.
<Q REND="inline">"The expressions of a poem, design'd purely for
instruction, ought to be plain and natural, and
yet majestic: for here the poet is presum'd to
be a kind of lawgiver, and those three qualities
which I have named, are proper to the legislative
style. The florid, elevated and figurative way,
is for the passions; for love and hatred, fear and
anger are begotten in the soul by shewing their
objects out of their true proportion; either greater
than the life or less; but instruction is to be given
by shewing them what they naturally are. A man
is to be cheated into passion, but to be reasoned
into truth."</Q></P>
<P>The following short piece may be perhaps a little
too pompously introduced by the foregoing obser∣vations;
all I shall say for it is, I endeavoured to
<PB N="66" REF="85"/>
follow Mr. Dryden's rules: how far I have succeeded,
I can be no proper judge myself. But whatever may
be said of the poetry, and about that I am very indif∣ferent,
the sentiments must surely be allowed to be
just and good; and I am entirely of Mr. Prior's opi∣nion:
<Q REND="inline">"I had rather be thought a good Englishman,
(which is but another word for an honest man)
than the best poet, or greatest scholar that ever
wrote."</Q></P>

Life was printed soon after the Essay on Man was ushered into the world

<L>To lift your heart and hands to heaven.</L>
<L>In double beauty say your prayer:</L>
<L>Our Father first,—then, <HI>Notre Pere:</HI></L>
<L>And, dearest child, along the day,</L>
<L>In every thing you do and say,</L>
<L>Obey and please my Lord and Lady,</L>
<L>So God shall love, and angels aid ye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to these precepts you attend,</L>
<L>No second letter need I send,</L>
<L>And so I rest your constant friend.</L>

as he wishes at his court (particularly such as dare
think or speak the truth.) I dare not do otherwise,
and ought not; nor could I have imagined that it
would not have been the highest compliment that I
could possibly pay the King, to endeavour to support
truth and innocence in his house.</P>

Phaedra and Hippolitus) had been pitched on as a proper person to write the
history of the Revolution. In consequence of this ap∣pointment, he waited
on Mr. Addison, who encouraged him to undertake it. To this he agreed; but
asking what was to be done with the character of Lord Sunder∣land, Mr.
Addison seemed confused, and replied that he was not prepared to answer
such a question. From that instant, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> heard no more of
the design.</NOTE></L>

<L>INSPIR'D with joy, we see the learned throng</L>
<L>Listen propitious to our humble song.</L>
<L>Within these walls, the infant muse delights</L>
<L>To plume her new-fledg'd wings for future flights.</L>
<L>Here trembling voices uncouth strains repeat,</L>
<L>Here bards first totter on poetic feet;</L>
<L>Till by degrees grown bold, with active skill,</L>
<L>They gain the summit of the sacred hill.</L>
<L>Thus Cowley, Dryden, Buckhurst, Prior came</L>
<L>First in the lists of poetry and fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not by our steps, nor labours such as these,</L>
<L>The brazen-fac'd Corinthian try'd to please;</L>
<L>But spite of Phoebus and the muse's art,</L>
<L>The actor fondly play'd the poet's part:</L>
<L>While with harsh untaught notes he wakes the plains</L>
<L>The sweeter cat-call emulates his strains.</L>
<L>Hiss'd, hooted, damn'd, despis'd, the scribbling fool</L>
<L>Finds to his cost, he was not bred at school.</L>
<L>He might have 'scap'd a yawning gallery's curses,</L>
<L>Had our third form first known his nonsense verses;</L>
<L>By humble steps he might have ris'n to praise,</L>

<L>A second time these accents pierc'd the air:</L>
<L>Sweet was the sound, transported was the fair.</L>
<L>At length, mankind are just, her la'ship said;</L>
<L>Threw on her gown, and stepping out of bed</L>

<L>In vain your pert and forward airs you try,</L>

<L>When young, we're cruel, and with beauty play,</L>
<L>Which while we vainly parley, fades away.</L>

<L>So peevish maids when past their youthful bloom,</L>
<L>On sad remains, and fancy'd charms presume;</L>
<L>Lonely they wander, no companion find,</L>
<L>Then rail, and quarrel with all human kind.</L>
<L>But let us to ourselves for once be just,</L>
<L>And see our own decays and wrinkles first.</L>
<L>Whene'er to melting sighs we lend an ear,</L>
<L>Think, youth and beauty make the men sincere.</L>
<L>No other powers their stubborn hearts can move:—</L>
<L>Did ever virtue light the torch of love?</L>

<L>Th' extremest proof of my desire, I give,</L>
<L>And since you will not love, I will not live.</L>
<L>Condemn'd by you, I wait the righteous doom,</L>
<L>Careless and fearless of the woes to come.</L>
<L>But when you see me waver in the wind,</L>
<L>My guilty flame extinct, my soul resign'd,</L>

<HEAD>Mr. JOHN PHILIPS's designed Dedication to his Poem called THE SPLENDID
SHILLING.</HEAD>
<HEAD>To W. BROME, Esq. of <HI>Ewithington,</HI> in the County of
<HI>Hereford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be too tedious an under∣taking
at this time to examine the rise and progress
of Dedications. The use of them is certainly an∣cient,
as appears both from Greek and Latin authors;
and we have reason to believe that it was continued
without any interruption till the beginning of this
century, at which time, mottos, anagrams, and
frontispieces being introduced, Dedications were
mightily discouraged, and at last abdicated. But to
discover precisely when they were restored, and by
whom they were first usher'd in, is a work that far
transcends my knowledge; a work that can justly
be expected from no other pen but that of your
operose Doctor Bentley. Let us therefore at present
acquiesce in the dubiousness of their antiquity, and
think the authority of the past and present times a
<PB N="189" REF="208"/>
sufficient plea for your patronizing, and my dedi∣cating
this poem. Especially since in this age Dedi∣cations
are not only fashionable, but almost necessary;
and indeed they are now so much in vogue, that a
book without one, is as seldom seen as a bawdy-house
without a Practice of Piety, or a poet with money.
Upon this account, Sir, those who have no friends,
dedicate to all good christians; some to their book∣sellers;
some for want of a sublunary patron to the
manes of a departed one. There are, that have de∣dicated
to their whores: God help those hen-peck'd
writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own
wives! but while I talk so much of other mens
patrons, I have forgot my own; and seem rather to
make an essay on Dedications, than to write one.
However, Sir, I presume you will pardon me for
that fault; and perhaps like me the better for saying
nothing to the purpose. You, Sir, are a person
more tender of other mens reputation than your own;
and would hear every body commended but yourself.
Should I but mention your skill in turning, and the
compassion you shew'd to my fingers ends when you
<PB N="190" REF="209"/>
gave me a tobacco stopper, you would blush and be
confounded with your just praises. How much more
would you, should I tell you what a progress you
have made in that abstruse and useful language, the
Saxon? Since, therefore, the recital of your excel∣lencies
would prove so troublesome, I shall offend
your modesty no longer. Give me leave to speak a
word or two concerning the poem, and I have done.
This poem, Sir, if we consider the moral, the new∣ness
of the subject, the variety of images, and the
exactness of the similitudes that compose it, must
be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the
moderns or ancients. The subject of the poem is
myself, a subject never yet handled by any poets.
How it to be handled by all, we may learn by those
few divine commendatory verses written by the ad∣mirable
Monsieur le Bog. Yet since I am the sub∣ject,
and the poet too, I shall say no more of it,
lest I should seem vain-glorious. As for the moral,
I have took particular care that it should lie in∣cognito,
not like the ancients who let you know at
first sight they design something by their verses. But
<PB N="191" REF="210"/>
here you may look a good while, and perhaps, after
all, find that the poet has no aim or design, which
must needs be a diverting surprize to the reader.
What shall I say of the similes that are so full of
geography, that you must get a Welshman to un∣derstand
them? that so raise our ideas of the things
they are apply'd to? that are so extraordinarily quaint
and well chosen that there's nothing like them? So
that I think I may, without vanity, say <HI>Avia Pieri∣dum
peragro loca, &amp;c.</HI> Yet however excellent this
poem is, in the reading of it you will find a vast dif∣ference
between some parts and others; which pro∣ceeds
not from your humble servant's negligence, but
diet. This poem was begun when he had little
victuals, and no moneys, and was finished when he
had the misfortune at a virtuous lady's house to meet
with both. But I hope, in time, Sir, when hunger
and poverty shall once more be my companions, to
make amends for the defaults of this poem, by an
essay on Minced Pies, which shall be devoted to you
with all submission, by,</P>

<P>I Am entering into proposals with a

Translations. I beg you to be altogether silent in
the matter. Mr. Pope has used so little of the 23d

among the rest I shall hardly incur any danger of
the penalty concerning the patent. However, I will
not presume to publish a single line of it after Mr.
Pope's Translation, if you advise me (as I desire you
to do sincerely) to the contrary. I shall send you a
small specimen of my Translation, which if you
approve of, I can assure you the remainder of the

<P>PRAY inform my Lord Harley that
I have on Thursday last seen the daughter of Milton
the poet. I carry'd with me two or three different
<PB N="196" REF="215"/>
prints of Milton's picture, which she immediately
knew to be like her father; and told me her mother-in-law
(if living in Cheshire) had two pictures of
him, one when he was a school boy, and the other
when he was about twenty. She knows of no other
picture of him, because she was several years in
Ireland, both before and after his death. She was
the youngest of Milton's daughters by his first wife,
and was taught to read to her father several languages.</P>
<P>Mr. Addison was desirous to see her once, and
desired she would bring with her testimonials of be∣ing
Milton's daughter, but as soon as she came into
the room he told her she needed none, her face
having much of the likeness of the pictures he had
seen of him.</P>
<P>For my part, I find the features of her face very
much like the prints. I showed her the painting I
have to engrave, which she believes not to be her
father's picture, it being of a brown complexion,
and black hair, and curled locks. On the contrary,
he was of a fair complexion, a little red in his
cheeks, and light brown lank hair.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="216"/>
I desire you would acquaint Mr. Prior I was so
unfortunate to wait on him on Thursday morning
last, just after he was gone out of town. It was
with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers
a picture of Milton in the late Lord Dorset's col∣lection,
as I am told this was; or if he can inform
me how I shall enquire or know the truth of this
affair, I should be much obliged to him, being very
willing to have all the certainty on that account
before I begin to engrave the plate, that it may be
the more satisfactory to the publick, as well as to
myself.</P>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>WE are indebted to Heaven for all
things, and above all for our sense and genius (in
whatever degree we have it); but to fancy yourself
indebted to any thing else, moves my anger at your
modesty. The regard I must bear you, seriously
proceeds from myself alone; and I will not suffer
even one I like so much as Mrs. H. to have a share
in causing it. I challenge a kind of relation to you
on the <HI>soul's</HI> side, which I take to be better than
either on a father's or mother's; and if you can
overlook an ugly <HI>body</HI> (that stands much in the way
of any friendship, when it is between different sexes)
I shall hope to find you a true and constant kinswo∣man
in Apollo. Not that I would place all my
pretensions upon that poetical foot, much less con∣fine
them to it; I am far more desirous to be ad∣mitted
<PB N="202" REF="221"/>
as yours, on the more meritorious title of
friendship. I have ever believed this as a sacred
maxim, that the most ingenious natures were the
most sincere; and the most knowing and sensible
minds made the best friends. Of all those that I
have thought it the felicity of my life to know, I
have ever found the most distinguished in capacity,
the most distinguished in morality: and those the
most to be depended on, whom one esteemed so
much as to desire they should be so. I beg you to
make me no more compliments. I could make you
a great many, but I know you neither need them,
nor can like them: be so good as to think I do not.
In one word, your writings are very good, and very
entertaining; but not so good, nor so entertaining,
as your life and conversation. One is but the effect
and emanation of the other. It will always be a
greater pleasure to me, to know you are well, than
that you write well, though every time you tell me
the one, I must know the other. I am willing to
spare your modesty; and therefore, as to your wri∣ting,
may perhaps never say more (directly to your∣self)
than the few verses I send here; which (as a
<PB N="203" REF="222"/>
proof of my own modesty too) I made so long ago
as the day you sate for your picture, and yet never
till now durst confess to you.</P>
<LG>
<L>Tho' sprightly Sappho force our love and praise,</L>
<L>A softer wonder my pleas'd soul surveys,</L>

<L>All mild appears the moon's more sober light,</L>
<L>Serene, in virgin majesty, she shines;</L>
<L>And, un-observ'd, the glaring sun declines.</L>

<P>The brightest wit in the world, without the
better qualities of the heart, must meet with this
fate; and tends only to endear such a character as
I take yours to be. In the better discovery, and
fuller conviction of which, I have a strong opinion,
I shall grow more and more happy, the longer I live

<P>THOUGH I am extremely obliged
by your agreeable letter, I will avoid all mention of
the pleasure you give me, that we may have no more
words about compliments; which I have often ob∣served
people talk themselves into, while they en∣deavour
to talk themselves out of. It is not more
the diet of friendship and esteem, than a few thin
wafers and marmalade were of so hearty a stomach
as Sancho's. In a word, I am very proud of my
new relation, and like Parnassus much the better,
since I found I had so good a neighbour there. Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, who lives at court, shall teach two country-folks
sincerity; and when I am so happy as to meet
you, she shall settle the proportions of that regard,
or good-nature, which she can allow you to spare
me, from a heart, which is so much her own as
yours is.</P>
<P>That lady is the most trusty of friends, if the
imitation of Shakespear be yours; for she made me
<PB N="205" REF="224"/>
give my opinion of it with assurance it was none of
Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>. I honestly liked and praised it, whose∣soever
it was; there is in it a sensible melancholy,
and too true a picture of human life; so true an
one, that I can scarce wish the verses yours at the
expence of your thinking that way, so early. I
rather wish you may love the town (which the
author of those lines cannot <HI>immoderately</HI> do) these
many years. It is time enough to like, or affect to
like, the country, when one is out of love with all
but one's-self, and therefore studies to become agree∣able
or easy to one's-self. Retiring into one's-self
is generally the <HI>pis-aller</HI> of mankind. Would you
have me describe my solitude and grotto to you?
What if, after a long and painted description of
them in verse (which the writer I have just been
speaking of could better make, if I can guess by
that line,
<Q><L>No noise but water, ever friend to thought)</L></Q>
what if it ended thus?
<Q><L>What are the falling rills, the pendant shades,</L>
<L>The morning bow'rs, the evening colonnades:</L>
<L><PB N="206" REF="225"/>
But soft recesses for th' uneasy mind,</L>
<L>To sigh un-heard in, to the passing wind!</L>
<L>So! the struck deer, in some sequester'd part,</L>
<L>Lies down to die (the arrow in his heart);</L>
<L>There hid in shades, and wasting day by day,</L>
<L>Inly he bleeds, and pants his soul away.</L></Q>
If these lines want poetry, they do not want sense.
God Almighty long preserve you from a feeling of
them! The book you mention, Bruyere's Characters,
will make any one know the world; and I believe
at the same time despise it (which is a sign it will
make one know it thoroughly). It is certainly the
proof of a master-hand, that can give such striking
likenesses, in such slight sketches, and in so sew
strokes on each subject. In answer to your question
about Shakespear, the book is about a quarter printed,
and the number of emendations very great. I have
never indulged my own conjectures, but kept meerly
to such amendments as are authorized by old editions,
in the author's life-time: but I think it will be a
year at least before the whole work can be finished.
In reply to your very handsome (I wish it were a very
<PB N="207" REF="226"/>
true) compliment upon this head, I only desire you
to observe, by what natural, gentle degrees I have
sunk to the humble thing I now am: first from a pre∣tending

a piece of news Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> tells me, which ought
to be the most agreeable in the world to any author,
That you are determined to write no more—It is
now the time then, not for me only, but for every
body, to write without fear, or wit: and I shall
give you the first example here. But for this assu∣rance,
it would be every way too dangerous to cor∣respond
with a lady, whose very first sight and very
first writings had such an effect, upon a man used to
what they call fine sights, and what they call fine
writings. Yet he has been dull enough to sleep
quietly, after all he has seen, and all he has read;
till yours broke in upon his stupidity and indolence,
and totally destroyed it. But, God be thanked, you
will write no more; so I am in no danger of in∣creasing
my admiration of you one way; and as to
the other, you will never (I have too much reason to
fear) open these eyes again with one glimpse of you.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="229"/>
I am told, you named lately in a letter a place
called Twitenham, with particular distinction. That
you may not be mis-construed and have your mean∣ing
mistaken for the future, I must acquaint you,
Madam, that the name of the place where Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> is, is not Twitenham, but Richmond; which
your ignorance in the geography of these parts has
made you confound together. You will unthink∣ingly
do honour to a paltry hermitage (while you
speak of Twitenham) where lives a creature altoge∣ther
unworthy your memory or notice, because he
really wishes he had never beheld you, nor yours.
You have spoiled him for a solitaire, and a book,
all the days of his life; and put him into such a
condition, that he thinks of nothing, and enquires
of nothing but after a person who has nothing to say
to him, and has left him for ever without hope of
ever again regarding, or pleasing, or entertaining
him, much less of seeing him. He has been so mad
with the idea of her, as to steal her picture, and
passes whole days in sitting before it, talking to him∣self,

<P>I Am touched with shame when I look
on the date of your letter. I have answered it a
hundred times in my own mind, which I assure you
has few thoughts, either so frequent or so lively, as
those relating to you. I am sensibly obliged by you,
in the comfort you endeavour to give me upon the
loss of a friend. It is like the shower we have had
this morning, that just makes the drooping trees
hold up their heads, but they remain checked and
withered at the root: the benediction is but a short
relief, though it comes from Heaven itself. The
loss of a friend is the loss of life; after that is gone
from us, it is all but a gentler decay, and wasting
and lingering a little longer. I was the other day
<PB N="212" REF="231"/>
forming a wish for a lady's happiness, upon her
birth-day: and thinking of the greatest climax of
felicity I could raise, step by step, to end in this—a Friend. I fancy I have succeeded in the gradation,
and send you the whole copy to ask your opinion, or
(which is much the better reason) to desire you to
alter it to your own wish: for I believe you are a
woman that can wish for yourself more reasonably,
than I can for you. Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> made me promise
her a copy; and to the end she may value it, I beg
it may be transcribed, and sent her by you.</P>

<L>Oh! be thou blest with all that Heaven can send:</L>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>YOUR last letter tells me, that if
I do not write in less than a month, you will fancy
the length of yours frighted me. A consciousness
that I had upon me of omitting too long to answer
it, made me look (not without some fear and trem∣bling)
for the date of it: but there happened to be
none; and I hope, either that you have forgot how
long it is, or at least that you cannot think it so
long as I do, since I writ to you. Indeed a multi∣tude
of things (which singly seem trifles, and yet
all together make a vast deal of business, and wholly
take up that time which we ought to value above all
such things) have from day to day made me wanting,
as well to my own greatest pleasure in this, as to my
own greatest concerns in other points. If I seem to
neglect any friend I have, I do more than seem to
neglect myself, as I find daily by the increasing ill
constitution of my body and mind. I still resolve
this course shall not, nay I see it cannot, be long;
<PB N="215" REF="234"/>
and I determine to retreat within myself to the only
business I was born for, and which I am only good
for (if I am entitled to use that phrase for any thing).
It is great folly to sacrifice one's self, one's time,
one's quiet (the very life of life itself), to forms,
complaisances, and amusements, which do not in∣wardly
please me, and only please a sort of people
who regard me no farther than a meer instrument of
their present idleness, or vanity. To say truth, the
lives of those we call great and happy are divided
between those two states; and in each of them, we
poetical fiddlers make but part of their pleasure, or
of their equipage. And the misery is, we, in our
turns, are so vain (at least I have been so) as to
chuse to pipe without being paid, and so silly to be
pleased with piping to those who understand musick
less than ourselves. They have put me of late upon
a task before I was aware, which I am <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>sore</HI>
of: and yet engaged in honour to some persons
whom I must neither disobey nor disappoint (I mean
two or three in the world only) to go on with it.
They make me do as mean a thing as the greatest
<PB N="216" REF="235"/>
man of them could do; seem to depend, and to
solicit, when I do not want; and make a kind of
court to those above my rank, just as they do to
those above theirs, when we might much more wise∣ly
and agreeably live of ourselves, and to ourselves.
You will easily find I am talking of my translating
the Odyssey by subscription: which looks, it must
needs look, to all the world as a design of mine both
upon fame and money, when in truth I believe I
shall get neither; for one I go about without any
stomach, and the other I shall not go about at all.</P>
<P>This freedom of opening my mind upon my own
situation, will be a proof of trust, and of an opi∣nion
your goodness of nature has made me entertain,
that you never profess any degree of good-will with∣out
being pretty warm in it. So I tell you my griev∣ances;
I hope in God you have none, wherewith to
make me any return of this kind. I hope that was
the only one which you communicated in your last,
about Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> silence; for which she wanted
not reproaches from me; and has since, she says,
amply atoned for. I saw a few lines of yours to her,
<PB N="217" REF="236"/>
which are more obliging to me than I could have
imagined: if you put <HI>my welfare</HI> into the small num∣ber
of things which you heartily wish (for a sensible
person, of either sex, will never wish for many), I
ought to be a happier man than I ever yet deserved
to be.</P>
<P>Upon a review of your papers, I have repented of
some of the trivial alterations I had thought of,
which were very few. I would rather keep them till
I have the satisfaction to meet you in the winter,
which I must beg earnestly to do; for hitherto me∣thinks
you are to me like a spirit of another world,
a being I admire, but have no commerce with: I
cannot tell but I am writing to a Fairy, who has left
me some favours, which I secretly enjoy, and shall
think it unlucky, if not fatal, to part with. So
pray do not expect your verses till farther ac∣quaintance.</P>

<P>NO confidence is so great, as that
one receives from persons one knows <HI>may be</HI> believed,
and in things one is <HI>willing</HI> to believe. I have (at
last) acquired this; by Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> repeated assurances
of a thing I am unfeignedly so desirous of, as your
allowing me to correspond with you. In good earnest,
there is sometimes in men as well as in women, a
great deal of unaffected modesty: and I was sincere
all along, when I told her personally, and told you
by my silence, that I feared only to seem imperti∣nent,
while perhaps I seemed negligent, to you. To
tell Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> any thing like what I really thought
of her, would have looked so like the common
traffick of compliment, that pays only to receive;
and to have told it her in distant or bashful terms,
would have appeared so like coldness in my sense of
good qualities (which I cannot find out in any one,
without feeling, from my nature, at the same time
a great warmth for them) that I was quite at a loss
<PB N="219" REF="238"/>
what to write, or in what stile, to you. But I am
resolved, plainly to get over all objections, and faith∣fully
to assure you, if you will help a bashful man
to be past all preliminaries, and forms, I am ready
to treat with you for your friendship. I know
(without more ado) you have a valuable soul; and
wit, sense, and worth enough, to make me reckon
it (provided you will permit it) one of the happi∣nesses
of my life to have been made acquainted with
you.</P>
<P>I do not know, on the other hand, what you can
think of me; but this, for a beginning, I will ven∣ture
to engage, that whoever takes me for a poet, or
a wit (as they call it), takes me for a creature of less
value than I am: and that where-ever I profess it,
you shall find me a much better man, that is, a
much better friend, or at least a much less faulty
one, than I am a poet. That whatever zeal I may
have, or whatever regard I may shew, for things I
truly am so pleased with as your entertaining wri∣tings;
yet I shall still have more for your person,
and for your health, and for your happiness. I
<PB N="220" REF="239"/>
would, with as much readiness, play the apothecary
or the nurse, to mend your head-akes, as I would
play the critick to improve your verses. I have
seriously looked over and over those you intrusted me
with; and assure you, Madam, I would as soon
cheat in any other trust, as in this. I sincerely tell
you, I can mend them very little, and only in trifles,
not worth writing about; but will tell you every
tittle when I have the happiness to see you.</P>
<P>I am more concerned than you can reasonably
believe, for the ill state of health you are at present

<P>IT happened that when I determined
to answer yours, by the post that followed my re∣ceipt
of it, I was prevented from the first proof I
have had the happiness to give you of my warmth
and readiness, in returning the epitaph, with my
sincere condolements with you on that melancholy
subject. But nevertheless I resolved to send you the
one, though unattended by the other: I begged Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> to inclose it, that you might at least see I
had not the power to delay a moment the doing what
you bid me; especially when the occasion of obeying
your commands was such, as must affect every ad∣mirer
and well-wisher of honour and virtue in the
nation.</P>
<P>You had it in the very blots, the better to com∣pare
the places; and I can only say it was done to
the best of my judgement, and to the extent of my
sincerity.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="241"/>
I do not wonder that you decline the poetical
amusement I proposed to you, at this time. I know
(from what little I know of your heart) enough at
least to convince me, it must be too deeply concerned
at the loss, not only of so great, and so near a rela∣tion;
but of a good man (a loss this age can hardly
ever afford to bear, and not often can sustain). Yet
perhaps it is one of the best things that can be said
of poetry, that it helps us to pass over the toils
and troubles of this tiresome journey, our life; as
horses are encouraged and spirited up, the better to
bear their labour, by the jingling of bells about
their heads. Indeed, as to myself, I have been used
to this odd cordial, so long, that it has no effect
upon me: but you, Madam, are in your honey∣moon
of poetry; you have seen only the smiles, and
enjoyed the caresses, of Apollo. Nothing is so
pleasant to a Muse as the first children of the Ima∣gination;
but when once she comes to find it meer
conjugal duty, and the care of her numerous progeny
daily grows upon her, it is all a sour tax for past
pleasure. As the Psalmist says on another occasion,
the age of a Muse is scarce above five and twenty:
<PB N="223" REF="242"/>
all the rest is labour and sorrow. I find by experi∣ence
that his own fiddle is no great pleasure to a com∣mon
fiddler, after once the first good conceit of
himself is lost.</P>
<P>I long at last to be acquainted with you; and Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> tells me you shall soon be in town, and I blest
with the vision I have so long desired. Pray believe
I worship you as much, and send my addresses to you
as often, as to any female Saint in Heaven: it is
certain I see you as little, unless it be in my sleep;
and that way too, holy hermits are visited by the
Saints themselves.</P>

<P>AFTER a very long expectation
and daily hopes of the satisfaction of seeing and
conversing with you, I am still deprived of it in a
manner that is the most afflicting, because it is oc∣casioned
by your illness and your misfortune. I can
bear my own, I assure you, much better: and thus
to find you lost to me, at the time that I hoped to
have regained you, doubles the concern I should
naturally feel in being deprived of any pleasure
whatever.</P>
<P>Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> can best express to you the concern of
a friend, who esteems and pities: for she has the
liberty to express it in her actions, and the satisfac∣tion
of attending on you in your indisposition.</P>
<P>I wish sincerely your condition were not such as
to debar me from telling you in person how truly I
am yours. I wish I could do you any little offices of
friendship, or give you any amusements, or help you
to what people in your present state most want,
better spirits. If reading to you, or writing to you,
<PB N="226" REF="245"/>
could contribute to entertain your hours, or to raise
you to a livelier relish of life, how well should I
think my time employed! indeed I should, and think
it a much better end of my poor studies, than all
the vanities of fame, or views of a character that
way, which engage most men of my fraternity.</P>
<P>If you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I
am your servant, you would take some notice of the
advice I would give you, and suffer it to have a
weight with you proportionable to the sincerity with
which it is given.</P>
<P>I beg you to do your utmost to call to you all the suc∣cours,
which your own good sense and natural reflexion
can suggest, to avoid a melancholy way of thinking,
and to throw up your spirits by intervals of moderate
company; not to let your distemper fix itself upon
your mind at least, though it will not entirely quit
your body. Do not indulge too much solitariness.
Though most company be not proper or supportable
during your illness, force yourself to enter into such
as is good and reasonable, where you may have your
liberty, and be under no restraint.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="246"/>
Why will you not come to your friend Mrs.
H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, since you are able to go out, and since motion
is certainly good for your health? Why will you not
make any little sets of such as you are easiest with, to
sit with you sometimes?</P>
<P>Do not think I have any interested aim in this advice:
though I long to see you, and to try to amuse you, I
would not for the world be considered as one that would
ever require for my own gratification, any thing that
might be improper or hurtful to you.</P>
<P>Pray let me know, by our friend Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, if there
can be anything in my power to serve, or to amuse you.
But use me so kindly, as not to think ever of writing to
me till you are so well as that I may see you, and then
it will be needless. Do not even read this, if it be
the least trouble to your eyes or head.</P>
<P>Believe me, with great respect, and the warmest
good wishes for your speedy recovery,</P>

<P>IT was an inexpressible pleasure to me
to see your letter, as I assure you it had long been a
great trouble, to reflect on the melancholy reason of
your silence and absence. It was that only which
hindered my writing, not only again, but often, to
you; for fear your good-nature should have been
prompted to oblige me too much at your own ex∣pence,
by answering. Indeed I never expressed (and
never shall be able to express) more concern and good
wishes for you, than I shall ever feel for one of your
merit.</P>
<P>I am sorry, the moment you grow better, to have

lamented and felt your illness.</P>
<P>Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, I hope, will find it not impossible

will not be long out of Hertfordshire. I want
<PB N="229" REF="248"/>
nothing but the same happy pretence she has, of a
title through your friendship, and the privilege of
her sex, to be there immediately. I cannot but
wonder you have not heard from her, though I
should wonder if any body else had; for I am told
by her family she has had much of the head-ake at
Bath, besides the excuse of a great giddiness occa∣sioned
naturally by the waters. I writ to her at the
first going, and have not had a word from her; and
now you tell me the same thing, I conclude she has
been worse than I imagine. I hear she returns on
Wednesday, when I shall have the satisfaction (I
doubt not) to talk and hear a great deal of Mrs. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/>.</P>
<P>I wish I could say any thing, either to comfort
you when ill, or entertain you when well. Though
nothing could, in the proper proportion of friend∣ship,
more affect me than your condition; I have
not wanted other occasions of great melancholy, of
which the least is the loss of part of my fortune by
a late Act of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="249"/>
I am at present in the afflicting circumstance of
taking my last leave of one of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bishop Atterbury.</NOTE> truest friends I
ever had, and one of the greatest men in all polite
learning, as well as the most agreeable companion,
this nation ever had.</P>
<P>I really do not love life so dearly, or so weakly, as
to value it on any other score, than for that portion
of happiness which a friend only can bestow upon
it: or, if I must want that myself, for the pleasure
which is next it, of seeing deserving and virtuous
people happy. So that indeed I want comfort; and
the greatest I can receive from you (at least unless I
were so happy as to deserve what I never can) will
be to hear you grow better till you grow perfectly
well, perfectly easy, and perfectly happy, which no
one more sincerely wishes than,</P>

<P>IT would be a vanity in me to tell you
why I trouble you so soon again: I cannot imagine
myself of the number of those correspondents whom
you call favourite ones; yet I know it is thought,
that industry may make a man what merit cannot:
and if an old maxim of my Lord Oxford's be true,
That in England if a man resolve to be any thing,
and constantly stick to it, he may (even a Lord
Treasurer): if so, I say, it shall not be want of re∣solution
that shall hinder me from being a favourite.
In good earnest, I am more ambitious of being so
to you, Madam, than I ever was, or ever shall be,
of being one to any Prince, or (which is more) any
Prince's minister, in Christendom.</P>
<P>I wish I could tell you any agreeable news of what
your heart is concerned in; but I have a sort of
quarrel to Mrs. H<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> for not loving herself so well
as she does her friends: for those she makes happy,
but not herself.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="251"/>
There is an air of sadness about her which grieves
me, and which, I have learnt by experience, will
increase upon an indolent (I will not say an affected)
resignation to it. It will do so in men, and much
more in women, who have a natural softness that
sinks them even when reason does not. This I tell
you in confidence; and pray give our friend such
hints as may put her out of humour with melan∣choly:
your censure, or even your raillery, may
have more weight with her than mine: a man can∣not
either so decently, or so delicately, take upon
him to be a physician in these concealed distempers.</P>
<P>You see, Madam, I proceed in trusting you with
things that nearly concern me. In my last letter I
spoke but of a trifle, myself: in this I advance
farther, and speak of what touches me more, a
friend.</P>
<P>This beautiful season will raise up so many rural
images and descriptions in a poetical mind, that I
expect, you, and all such as you (if there be any
such), at least all who are not downright dull trans∣lators,
<PB N="233" REF="252"/>
like your servant, must necessarily be pro∣ductive
of verses.</P>
<P>I lately saw a sketch this way on the bower of
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lines here alluded to are as follows:
<Q><L>In Tempe's shades the living lyre was strung,</L>
<L>And the first Pope (immortal Phoebus) sung,</L>
<L>These happy shades, where equal beauty reigns,</L>
<L>Bold rising hills, slant vales, and far-stretch'd plains,</L>
<L>The grateful verdure of the waving woods,</L>
<L>The soothing murmur of the falling floods,</L>
<L>A nobler boast, a higher glory yield,</L>
<L>Than that which Phoebus stampt on Tempe's field:</L>
<L>All that can charm the eye, or please the ear,</L>
<L>Says, Harmony itself inhabits here.</L></Q></NOTE> BEDINGTON: I could wish you tried something
in the descriptive way on any subject you please,
mixed with vision and moral; like pieces of the old
provençal poets, which abound with fancy, and are
the most amusing scenes in nature. There are three
or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable: "The
Flower and the Leaf" every body has been de∣lighted
with.</P>
<P>I have long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale,
the more wild and exotic the better; therefore a
<PB N="234" REF="253"/>
<HI>vision,</HI> which is confined to no rules of probability,
will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of de∣scription
you will; provided there be an apparent
moral to it. I think, one or two of the Persian
Tales would give one hints for such an invention:
and perhaps if the scenes were taken from real places
that are known, in order to compliment particular
gardens and buildings of a fine taste (as I believe
several of Chaucer's descriptions do, though it is
what nobody has observed), it would add great
beauty to the whole.</P>
<P>I wish you found such an amusement pleasing to
you: if you did but, at leisure, form descriptions
from objects in nature itself, which struck you most
livelily, I would undertake to find a tale that should
bring them all together: which you will think an
odd undertaking, but in a piece of this fanciful and
imaginary nature I am sure is practicable. Excuse
this long letter; and think no man is more</P>

Nôtre amitié est trop etroite, elle est, ainsi que
le diroit Montaigne, trop libre et trop franche dans
ses allures, pour que je m'enveloppe avec vous

de cette fausse modestie, dont il faut quelquefois
se faire un bouclier contre l'envie. Je vous dirai
donc hardiment que ces trois hommes sont vous,
MOI, et POPE."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"MY dear friend, among the croud of
men whom it may have fallen in my way to
know, and whose understandings and characters
I have endeavoured to study, I have not yet
marked out above THREE that appeared to me
worthy of being trusted with the care of govern∣ing
nations. Our friendship is too intimate, and,
as Montaigne would perhaps choose to express
himself, too frank and free in its paces for me to
need, with you, the wrapping myself up in that
false modesty, of which there is sometimes a ne∣cessity
for making a shield against envy. I shall
then tell you boldly that these three men are YOU,
MYSELF, and POPE."</Q></P>
