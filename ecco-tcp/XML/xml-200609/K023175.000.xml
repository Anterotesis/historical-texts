<L>Vice with such Giant-strides comes on amain,</L>

<L>But Sir, I beg you, for the Love of Vice!</L>
<L>The matter's weighty, pray consider twice:</L>
<L>Have you less Pity for the needy Cheat,</L>
<L>The poor and friendless Villian, than the Great?</L>
<L>Alas! the small Discredit of a Bribe</L>

<L><HI>A.</HI> What always <HI>Peter? Peter</HI> thinks you mad,</L>

<L>The Scene, the Master, opening to my view,</L>

<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Ev'n in a Bishop I can spy Desert;</L>
<L><HI>Secker</HI> is decent, <HI>Rundel</HI> has a Heart,</L>
<L>Manners with Candour are to <HI>Benson</HI> giv'n,</L>
<L>To <HI>Berkley,</HI> ev'ry Virtue under Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But does the Court a worthy Man remove?</L>
<L>That instant, I declare he has my Love:</L>
<L>I shun his Zenith, court his mild decline;</L>
<L>Thus SOMMERS once, and HALIFAX were mine.</L>
<L>Oft in the clear, still Mirrour of Retreat,</L>
<L>I study'd SHREWSBURY, the wise and great:</L>
<L>CARLETON's calm Sense, and STANHOPE's noble Flame</L>
<L>Compar'd, and knew their gen'rous End the same:</L>
<L>How pleasing ATTERBURY's softer hour!</L>
<L>How shin'd the Soul, unconquer'd in the Tow'r!</L>
<L>How can I PULT'NEY, CHESTERFIELD forget,</L>
<L>While <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit charms, and <HI>Attic</HI> Wit:</L>
<L>ARGYLE, the States whole Thunder born to wield,</L>
<L>And shake alike the Senate and the Field:</L>
<L>Or WYNDHAM, arm'd for Freedom and the Throne,</L>
<L>The Master of our Passions, and his own.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Names, which I long have lov'd, nor lov'd in vain,</L>
<L>Rank'd with their Friends, not number'd with their Train;</L>
<L>And if yet higher the proud List should end,</L>
<L>Still let me say! No Follower, but a Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet think not Friendship only prompts my Lays;</L>
<L>I follow <HI>Virtue,</HI> where she shines, I praise,</L>
<L>Point she to Priest or Elder, Whig or Tory,</L>
<L>Or round a Quaker's Beaver cast a Glory.</L>
<L>I never (to my sorrow I declare)</L>
<L>Din'd with the MAN of ROSS, or my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Barnard.</NOTE>LORD MAY'R.</L>
<L>Some, in their choice of Friends (nay, look not grave)</L>
<L>Have still a secret Byass to a Knave:</L>
<L>To find an honest man, I beat about,</L>
<L>And love him, court him, praise him, in or out.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A.</HI> Then why so few commended?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>B.</HI> Not so fierce;</L>
<L>Find you the Virtue, and I'll find the Verse.</L>
<L>But random Praise—the Task can ne'er be done,</L>
<L>Each Mother asks it for her Booby Son,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Each Widow asks it for the Best of Men,</L>
<L>For him she weeps, and him she weds again.</L>
<L>Praise cannot stoop, like Satire, to the Ground;</L>
<L>The Number may be hang'd, but not be crown'd.</L>
<L>Enough for half the Greatest of these days</L>
<L>To 'scape my Censure, not expect my Praise:</L>
<L>Are they not rich? what more can they pretend?</L>
<L>Dare they to hope a Poet for their Friend?</L>
<L>What <HI>Richlieu</HI> wanted, <HI>Louis</HI> scarce could gain,</L>
<L>And what young <HI>Ammon</HI> wish'd, but wish'd in vain.</L>
<L>No Pow'r the Muse's Friendship can command;</L>
<L>No Pow'r, when Virtue claims it, can withstand:</L>
<L>To <HI>Cato, Virgil</HI> pay'd one honest line;</L>
<L>O let my Country's Friends illumin mine!</L>
<L>—What are you thinking? <HI>A.</HI> Faith, the thought's no Sin,</L>
<L>I think your Friends are out, and would be in.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>B.</HI> If merely to come in, Sir, they go out,</L>
<L>The way they take is strangely round about.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A.</HI> They too may be corrupted, you'll allow?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>B.</HI> I only call those Knaves, who are so now▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>Is that too little? Come then, I'll comply—</L>
<L>Spirit of <HI>Arnall!</HI> aid me while I lye.</L>
<L><HI>Cobbam</HI>'s a Coward, <HI>Polwarth</HI> is a Slave,</L>
<L>And <HI>Lyttleton</HI> a dark, designing Knave,</L>
<L>St. <HI>John</HI> has ever been a wealthy Fool—</L>
<L>But let me add, Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s mighty dull,</L>
<L>Has never made a Friend in private life,</L>
<L>And was, besides, a Tyrant to his Wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But pray, when others praise him, do I blame?</L>
<L>Call <HI>Clodius, Wolsey,</HI> any odious name?</L>
<L>Why rail they then, if but a Wreath of mine</L>
<L>Oh All-accomplish'd St. <HI>John!</HI> deck thy Shrine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What? shall each spur-gall'd Hackney of the Day,</L>
<L>When <HI>Pax<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>n</HI> gives him double Pots and Pay,</L>
<L>Or each new-pension'd Sycophant, pretend</L>
<L>To break my Windows, if I treat a Friend;</L>
<L>Then wisely plead, to me they meant no hurt,</L>
<L>But 'twas my Guest at whom they threw the dirt?</L>
<L>Sure, if I spare the Minister, no rules</L>
<L>Of Honour bind me, not to maul his Tools;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Sure, if they cannot cut, it may be said</L>
<L>His saws are toothless, and his Hatchets Lead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It anger'd <HI>Turenne,</HI> once upon a day,</L>
<L>To see a Footman kick'd that took his pay:</L>
<L>But when he heard th'Affront the Fellow gave,</L>
<L>Knew one a Man of Honour, one a Knave;</L>
<L>The prudent Gen'ral turn'd it to a jest,</L>
<L>And begg'd, he'd take the pains to kick the rest.</L>
<L>Which not at present having time to do—</L>
<L><HI>A.</HI> Hold Sir! for God's sake, where's th' Affront to you?</L>
<L>Against your worship what has <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>k</HI> writ?</L>
<L>When did <HI>Ty<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>l</HI> hurt you with his Wit?</L>
<L>Or grant, the Bard whose Distich all commend,</L>
<L>[<HI>In Pow'r a Servant, out of Pow'r a Friend.</HI>]</L>
<L>To <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>le</HI> guilty of some venial Sin,</L>
<L>What's that to you, who ne'er was out nor in?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Priest whose Flattery be-dropt the Crown,</L>
<L>How hurt he you? he only stain'd the Gown.</L>
<L>And how did, pray the Florid Youth offend,</L>
<L>Whose Speech you took, and gave it to a Friend?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L><HI>B.</HI> Faith it imports not much from whom it came;</L>
<L>Whoever borrow'd, could not be to blame,</L>
<L>Since the whole House did afterwards the same:</L>
<L>Let Courtly Wits to Wits afford supply,</L>
<L>As Hog to Hog in Huts of <HI>Westphaly</HI>;</L>
<L>If one, thro' Nature's Bounty or his Lord's,</L>
<L>Has what the frugal, dirty soil affords,</L>
<L>From him the next receives it, thick or thin,</L>
<L>As pure a Mess almost as it came in;</L>
<L>The blessed Benefit, not there confin'd,</L>
<L>Drops to the third who nuzzles close behind;</L>
<L>From tail to mouth, they feed, and they carouse;</L>
<L>The last, full fairly gives it to the <HI>House.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A.</HI> This filthy Simile, this beastly Line,</L>
<L>Quite turns my Stomach—<HI>B.</HI> So does Flatt'ry mine;</L>
<L>And all your Courtly Civet-Cats can vent,</L>
<L>Perfume to you, to me is Excrement.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But hear me further—<HI>Japhet,</HI> 'tis agreed,</L>
<L>Writ not, and <HI>Chartres</HI> scarce could write or read,</L>
<L>In all the Courts of <HI>Pindus</HI> guiltless quite:</L>
<L>But Pens can sorge, my Friend, that cannot write.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
And must no Egg in <HI>Japhet</HI>'s Face be thrown,</L>
<L>Because the Deed he forg'd was not my own?</L>
<L>Must never Patriot then declaim at Gin,</L>
<L>Unless, good man! he has been fairly in?</L>
<L>No zealous Pastor blame a failing Spouse,</L>
<L>Without a staring Reason on his Brows?</L>
<L>And each Blasphemer quite escape the Rod,</L>
<L>Because the insult's not on Man, but God?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ask you what Provocation I have had?</L>
<L>The strong Antipathy of Good to Bad.</L>
<L>When Truth or Virtue an Affront endures,</L>
<L>Th' Affront is mine, my Friend, and should be yours.</L>
<L>Mine, as a Foe profess'd to false Pretence,</L>
<L>Who think a Coxcomb's Honour like his Sense;</L>
<L>Mine, as a Friend to ev'ry worthy mind;</L>
<L>And mine as Man, who feel for all mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A.</HI> You're strangely proud.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>B.</HI> So proud, I am no Slave;</L>
<L>So impudent, I own myself no Knave:</L>
<L>So odd, my Country's Ruin makes me grave.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Yes, I am proud; I must be proud to see</L>
<L>Men not afraid of God, afraid of me:</L>
<L>Safe from the Bar, the Pulpit, and the Throne,</L>
<L>Yet touch'd and sham'd by <HI>Ridicule</HI> alone.</L>
<L>O sacred Weapon! left for Truth's defence,</L>
<L>Sole dread of Folly, Vice, and Insolence!</L>
<L>To all but Heav'n-directed hands deny'd,</L>
<L>The Muse may give thee, but the Gods must guide.</L>
<L>Rev'rent I touch thee! but with honest zeal;</L>
<L>To rowze the Watchmen of the Publick Weal,</L>
<L>To Virtue's Work provoke the tardy Hall,</L>
<L>And goad the Prelate slumb'ring in his Stall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye tinsel Insects! whom a Court maintains,</L>
<L>That counts your Beauties only by your Stains,</L>
<L>Spin all your Cobwebs o'er the Eye of Day!</L>
<L>The Muse's wing shall brush you all away:</L>
<L>All his Grace preaches, all his Lordship sings,</L>
<L>All that makes Saints of Queens, and Gods of Kings,</L>
<L>All, all bat Truth, drops dead born from the Press,</L>
<L>Like the last Gazette, or the last Address.</L>

<L>When black Ambition stains a Publick Cause,</L>
