<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following ODES were written at very
distant intervals, and with a view to very
different manners of expression and versification.
The author pretends chiefly to the merit of en∣deavouring
to be correct, and of carefully attend∣ing
to the best models. From what the ancients
have left of this kind, perhaps the ODE may be
allow'd the most amiable species of poetry; but
certainly there is none which in modern langua∣ges
has been generally attempted with so little
success. For the perfection of lyric poetry de∣pends,
beyond that of any other, on the beauty
of words and the gracefulness of numbers; in both
which respects the ancients had infinite advan∣tages
above us. A consideration which will alle∣viate
the author's disappointment, if he too should
be found to have miscarried.</P>

<L>THE radiant ruler of the year</L>
<L>At length his wintry goal attains,</L>
<L>Soon to reverse the long career,</L>
<L>And Northward bend his golden reins.</L>
<L>Prone on POTOSI's haughty brow</L>
<L>His fiery streams incessant flow,</L>
<L>Ripening the silver's ductile stores;</L>
<L>While, in the cavern's horrid shade,</L>
<L>The panting Indian hides his head,</L>
<L>And oft th' approach of eve explores.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But lo, on this deserted coast</L>
<L>How faint the light! how thick the air!</L>
<L>Lo arm'd with whirlwind, hail and frost,</L>
<L>Fierce winter desolates the year.</L>
<L>The fields resign their chearful bloom;</L>
<L>No more the breezes waft persume,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/> No more the warbling waters roll:</L>
<L>Desarts of snow fatigue the eye,</L>
<L>Black storms involve the louring sky,</L>
<L>And gloomy damps oppress the soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now thro' the town promiscuous throngs</L>
<L>Urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire;</L>
<L>Harmonious dances, festive songs,</L>
<L>To charm the midnight hours conspire.</L>
<L>While mute and shrinking with her fears,</L>
<L>Each blast the cottage-matron hears</L>
<L>As o'er the hearth she sits alone:</L>
<L>At morn her bridegroom went abroad,</L>
<L>The night is dark and deep the road;</L>
<L>She sighs and wishes him at home.</L>

<L>But thou, my lyre, awake, arise,</L>

<L>To-morrow nearer than to-day.</L>
<L>Then louder howl the stormy waste,</L>
<L>Be land and ocean worse defac'd,</L>
<L>Yet brighter hours are on the wing;</L>
<L>And fancy thro' the wintry glooms,</L>
<L>All fresh with dews and opening blooms,</L>
<L>Already hails th' emerging spring.</L>

<L>O fountain of the golden day!</L>

<L>INDEED, my PHAEDRIA, if to find</L>
<L>That gold a female's vow can gain,</L>

<L>I should have said that all the rules</L>

<L>When HESPER gilds the shaded sky,</L>

<L>No kindling blush you know not why?</L>
