<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I PRESENT the Reader with an im∣perfect
attempt on an important
topic. The materials designed for
this Essay, with others, have been
accidentally destroyed. The fol∣lowing
sketches are therefore not so
numerous as I could wish, and as
the subject appears to promise. They
claim all the indulgence of the title.</P>
<P>I have long considered, what I ima∣gine
will be readily acknowledged,
that there is a similarity in the cha∣racters
of Men of Genius, perceivable
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
to a contemplative mind, and that
reflections on their character may be
exemplified by a sufficient number
of facts. To seise the dispositions
of the Literary Character, I looked
therefore into Literary History, and
my collections exceeded my hopes.</P>
<P>When Rousseau composed his Dis∣sertation
on the Equality of Man,
this eloquent philosopher sought for
<HI>facts,</HI> on which to found his reason∣ings;
these he collected from an
extensive perusal of voyages and ac∣counts
of remote nations. I consi∣dered
that to form just reflections on
Men of Genius, it was proper to
collect facts from their biography,
and their concatenation produced all
my reflections.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>
The more I meditate, the more I
am persuaded that all speculations
are illusory and unsatisfactory, unless
they are established on prominent
facts, which are to be first collected
before we venture to indulge meta∣physical
disquisitions. It is an ob∣servation
of Bolingbroke, that <Q REND="inline">ab∣stract
or general propositions,
though never so true, appear ob∣scure
or doubtful to us very often,
till they are explained by <HI>exam∣ples</HI>—when
examples are pointed
out to us, there is a kind of appeal,
with which we are flattered, made
to our senses, as well as our un∣derstandings.
The instruction
comes then from our authority;
<HI>we yield to fact, when we resist
speculation.</HI></Q> If we compare the
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
labours of Machiavel with those of
Montesquieu, we may observe, that
the illustrious Frenchman had all the
delicacy, the refinement, and the
sensibility of his nation, and his gene∣ral
reflections are therefore brilliant,
but often fallacious, because not built
on the permanent base of experience.
The crafty Florentine, versant in the
manners of Princes, with sagacity
equal to his genius, deduces all his
reflections from those prominent
<HI>facts</HI> which passed under his eye, or
which he collected from the records
of instructive history. Lord Bacon
introduced that wise philosophy
which is only founded on <HI>experi∣ments</HI>;
the study of Nature in her
operations. And I believe every ju∣dicious
physician prefers the manner
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
of Sydenham, who derives his medical
fame from the vigilant observation,
and the continued experience of
tracing the progress of actual cases,
in the operation of actual remedies,
to that of some modern medical
writers, who, dazzled by specula∣tive
phantoms, promulge paradoxes,
which, unconfirmed by facts, produce
much more serious consequence than
literary paradoxes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Readers of "A Dissertation on Anecdotes" will please to accept these observations, as a final supplement to that tract.</NOTE></P>
<P>The LITERARY CHARACTER
has, in the present day, singularly
degenerated in the public mind. The
finest compositions appear with∣out
exciting any alarm of admiration,
they are read, approved, and suc∣ceeded
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
by others; nor is the presence
of the Author considered, as for∣merly,
as conferring honour on his
companions; we pass our evenings
sometimes with poets and historians,
whom it is probable will be admired
by posterity, with hardly any other
sensation than we feel from inferior
associates.</P>
<P>The youth who has more reading
than experience, and a finer imagi∣nation
than a sound logic, will often
be surprised when he compares the
splendid facts stored in his memory,
with the ordinary circumstances that
pass under his eye. In the history of
all ages, and of all nations, he ob∣serves
the highest honours paid to
the Literary Character. Statues,
tombs, festivals, and coronations,
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
croud in glittering confusion, while,
when he condescends to look around
him, he perceives the brilliant en∣chantment
dissolved, and not a ves∣tige
remains of the festivals and the
coronations.</P>
<P>Before I attempt to alledge a reason
for a singular revolution in the human
mind, I shall arrange a few striking
facts of the numerous honours which
have been paid to the Literary Cha∣racter.</P>
<P>I must not dwell on the distinc∣tions
bestowed on the learned by the
Greeks and the Romans; their tem∣ples,
their statues, their games, and
fleets dispatched to invite the Stu∣dent;
these honours were more
numerous and splendid than those of
modern ages. I must not detail the
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
magnificent rewards and the high
veneration paid by the Persians, the
Turks, the Arabians, the Chinese,
&amp;c. The Persian Ferdosi received
sacks of gold for his verses; the
Arabs have sent ambassadors to con∣gratulate
poets on the success of their
works; Mahomet took off his man∣tle
to present to an Author; and
literature in China confers nobility.
But I pass this romantic celebrity, to
throw a rapid glance on our own
Europe.</P>
<P>Not to commence more remotely
than at the thirteenth century,
when Nobles, and even Kings, aspi∣red
to literature. Authors, of course,
were held in the highest estimation.
Fauchet and Pasquier inform us, that
the learned received magnificent
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
dresses, steeds richly caparisoned,
and arms resplendent with diamonds
and gold. The Floral games at
Toulouse were established; and three
prizes of golden flowers were re∣served
for the happy poets. It was
in the fourteenth century that the Ita∣lians
raised triumphal arches, tombs,
and coronations, for distinguished
Authors. Ravenna erected a marble
tomb to the memory of Dante; Cer∣taldo
a statue to Boccaccio, and Pe∣trarch
was at once invited by the city
of Rome and the court of France, to
receive the crown of laurel. Rome
was preferred, and there he was pub∣lickly
crowned with such magnifi∣cence
of pomp, and ceremonies so
splendid and numerous, that his own
imagination could not have surpassed
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
the realities of this triumph.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I lament much that Dr. Burney, whose learning excels my praise, and whose elegance is not inferior to his learning, has treated this subject with great levity. He says, in his valuable History of Music, vol. 2. p. 332, that this was a censureable vanity—and that <Q REND="inline">the blame can only be laid on his <HI>youth,</HI> or rather on <HI>the practice of the times.</HI></Q> And he continues in a strain of ridicule to censure these testi∣monies of national sensibility. But I observe, that the learned Doctor, while he smiles at this popular display and vanity, has prefixed to his performance <HI>his own portrait</HI> in (what some may consider) <HI>the af∣fected posture</HI> of <HI>beating time,</HI> painted by Reynolds, and engraved by Bartolozzi. The Doctor makes an animated appearance; but this <HI>public exhibition</HI> of Burney, has not less vanity than that of Petrarch; must not we apply to the Doctor his own words, and <Q REND="inline">lay the blame on his youth, or rather <HI>on the practice of the times?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The error of Dr. Burney, in this instance, pro∣ceeds from his not confessing that there was <HI>no va∣nity</HI> in the coronation of Petrarch; for the love of glory is something very superior to vanity.</P></NOTE> Tasso
died the evening of his coronation.
In the fifteenth century, Sannazarius
received from the Venetians for six
verses, six hundred pistoles, and
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
poets were kissed by princesses. Later
times saw the phlegmatic Hollander
raise astatue to the excellent Erasmus.
Let us not omit that Charles IX. of
France reserved apartments in his
palace, and even wrote a poetical
epistle to Ronsard; and Baif received
a silver image of Minerva from his
native city. Charles V. and Francis I.
in the sixteenth century, poured
honours, preferments, and gifts, on
the learned of their age. Literary
merit was the road to promotion, and
seignories and abbeys, seats in the
state council, and ambassadorships
were bestowed upon the Literary
Character.</P>
<P>Since all this is truth, yet at
present appears much like fiction, it
may be enquired if our ancestors
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
were wiser than we, or we more wise
than our ancestors.</P>
<P>It is to be recollected, that before
the art of printing existed, great
Authors were like their works, very
rare; learning was then only ob∣tained
by the devotion of a life. It
was long after the art of multiplying
works at pleasure was discovered,
that the people were capable of par∣ticipating
in the novel benefit; what
Alexander feared, when he reproached
Aristotle for rendering learning po∣pular,
has happened to modern lite∣rature;
learning and talents have
ceased to be learning and talents, by
an universal diffusion of books, and
a continued exercise of the mind.
Authors became numerous, but as
the body of the people, till within
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
the present century, was sufficiently
unenlightened, their numbers were not
yet found inconvenient; and as dic∣tionaries
were not yet formed, every
man was happy to seise on whatever
particles of knowledge accident of∣fered;
so late as the middle of this
century, Translators were yet es∣teemed,
and Compilers were yet re∣spected.</P>
<P>But since, with incessant industry,
volumes have been multiplied, and
their prices rendered them accessible
to the lowest artisans, the Literary
Character has gradually fallen into
disrepute. It may be urged that a
superior mind, long cultivated, and
long exercised, adorned with polite,
and enriched with solid letters, must
still retain it's pre-eminence among
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
the inferior ranks of men; and there∣fore
may still exact the same respect
from his fellow-citizens, and still
continue the dignity of an Author
with the same just claims as in pre∣ceding
ages.</P>
<P>I believe, however, that he who
would be reverenced as an Author has
only one resource; and that is, by
paying to himself that reverence,
which will be refused by the multi∣tude.
The respect which the higher
classes shew to the Literary Character,
proceeds from habitual politeness,
and not from any sensibility of ad∣miration;
and that this is true, ap∣pears
from this circumstance, that,
should the Literary Character, in re∣turn,
refuse to accommodate himself
to their regulations, and have not the
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
art of discovering what quality they
expect to be remarked in themselves,
he will be soon forsaken; and he
may say what Socrates did at the
court of Cyprus, <Q REND="inline">what I know is
not proper for this place, and
what is proper for this place, I
know not.</Q> Men of the world
are curious to have a glance at a
celebrated Author, as they would be
at some uncommon animal; he is
therefore sometimes exhibited, and
spectators are invited. A croud of
frivolists gaze at a Man of Letters,
and catch the sounds of his ideas, as
children regard the reflections of a
magic lanthorn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The observation of the great Erasmus on Men of Letters, is not less just than admirable. He said, that they were like the great figures in the tapestries of Flanders, which lose their effect, when not seen at a distance.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
Nor will the Literary Character
find a happier reception among others
if he exacts an observance of his
dignity. Authors are a multitude;
and it requires no inconsiderable
leisure and intelligence to adjust the
claims of such numerous candidates.</P>
<P>De Foe called the last age, the
age of Projectors, and Johnson has
called the present, the age of Au∣thors.
But there is this difference
between them; the epidemical folly
of projecting in time cures itself, for
men become weary with ruination;
but writing is an interminable pur∣suit,
and the raptures of publication
have a great chance of becoming a
permanent fashion. When I reflect
that every literary journal consists of
50 or 60 publications, and that of
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
these, 5 or 6 at least are capital per∣formances,
and the greater part not
contemptible, when I take the pen
and attempt to calculate, by these
given sums, the number of volumes
which the next century must infal∣libly
produce, my feeble faculties
wander in a perplexed series, and
as I lose myself among billions, tril∣lions,
and quartillions, I am obliged
to lay down my pen, and stop at in∣finity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">Where all this will end, God
only knows,</Q> is the reflection of
a grave historian, in concluding the
Memoirs of his Age. Nature has,
no doubt, provided some concealed
remedy for this future universal de∣luge.
Perhaps in the progress of
science, some new senses may be dis∣covered
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>
in the human character, and
this superfluity of knowledge may be
essential to the understanding, We
are considerably indebted, doubtless,
to the patriotic endeavours of our
grocers and trunkmakers, whom I
respect as the alchemists of literature;
they annihilate the gross bodies, with∣out
injuring the finer spirits.</P>
<P>We are, however, sincerely to la∣ment
that the dignity of great Au∣thors
is at all impaired. Every kind
of writers find a correspondent kind
of readers, and the illiterate have their
admirers, and are of some use. But it
is time that we should distinguish be∣tween
Authors, and submit ourselves
to respect those, from whom we ac∣quire
instruction, and to cherish those,
from whom we derive the most ele∣gant
of our amusements.</P>

profound <HI>thinkers,</HI> deciding on a subject of

Their piety was too ponderous for
the exertion of their fancy. The divinity
of Clarke, and the logic of Johnson, were
alike fatal to certain delicious strokes in the

poetical refinement escaped their unelastic or∣gans,

ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of Literary Men.</HEAD>
<P>A NUMEROUS and an important body
of men, diffused over enlightened Eu∣rope,
and classed under no particular
profession, are, during the most arduous
period of their life, unassisted and unre∣garded;
and while often devoting them
selves to national purposes, are exposed
not only to poverty, the fate of the many;
to calumny, the portion of the great;
but to an ugly family of peculiar misfor∣tunes.
These are men of letters; men
whose particular genius often becomes
<PB N="2" REF="24"/>
that of a people; the sovereigns of rea∣son;
the legislators of morality; the ar∣tificers
of our most exquisite pleasures.</P>
<P>Every other body of ingenious men
(whether the corporation of useful me∣chanics,
or the society of great artists)
are allowed some common association;
some domestic seat devoted to the genius
of their profession, where they are mu∣tually
enlightened and consoled. Men
of letters, in our country resemble
<Q>Houseless wanderers,</Q>
scattered and solitary, disunited and lan∣guid;
whose talents are frequently un∣known
to their companions, and by the
inertness of an unhappy situation, often
unperceived by themselves.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that those men in the
nation who are most familiar with each
other's conceptions, and most capable
of reciprocal esteem, are those who are
often most estranged.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="3" REF="25"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of Authors.</HEAD>
<P>IT is necessary to distinguish between
an Author, and a Writer; because, the
descriptions which I propose to sketch
of the situations to which genius is fre∣quently
exposed, will not happen to those
whose productions are their occasional
effusions; and who seldom propose in
the puerile age, to become Authors. I
shall consider that no Writer, has a just
claim to the title of Author, whose
CHIEF EMPLOYMENT is not that of STUDY
and COMPOSITION. Richardson the no∣velist,
and Gessner the poet, were both
printers, and this will, occasionally, ex∣clude
them from the idea I at present
attach to an author. Hume and Bayle,
Johnson and Voltaire, are students who
assumed the profession of authors. The
<PB N="4" REF="26"/>
occasional productions of a man of genius
are so many sportive offerings laid on
the altar of the Graces; the more volu∣minous
labours of great authors, are so
many trophies raised on a triumphal
column.</P>
<P>I totally exclude from these specula∣tions
two kinds of writers. Those who
disgrace letters and humanity by an ab∣ject
devotion to their private interests,
and who like Atalanta, for the sake of
the apples of gold, lose the glory of
the race; and those who intrude on the
public notice without adequate talents,
whose vanity listens to a few encomiasts
whose politeness is greater than their dis∣cernment,
or who applaud loudly and
censure in whispers.</P>
<P>If we enquire into the character of an
author, we find that every class of men
entertains a different notion of his occu∣pations.
We perceive also that the lite∣rary
<PB N="5" REF="27"/>
world are divided into parties; and
that they are mutually unjust. Few are
capable of honouring this character; in∣dividuals
err from various motives; the
public only are enlightened and just.</P>
<P>The importance of an author in so∣ciety,
is yet so little known, that it is
rarely apparent even to authors them∣selves.</P>
<P>The fashionable circle conceive an au∣thor
must be an amusing companion;
they consider his presence, like the other
ornaments of their tables. It implies
that they are persons of taste.</P>
<P>The busy part of mankind suppose an
author to be a trader; and are only asto∣nished
to observe men persevere in an
occupation so unprofitable.</P>
<P>The statesman only regards a philoso∣phical
writer as a man of dangerous spe∣culations,
who, if left in security, is
daring, if attacked by persecution, is
<PB N="6" REF="28"/>
intrepid. One who makes him tremble
in the darkness of his most secret coun∣cils.</P>
<P>The man of science regards his pro∣ductions
with contempt, and at the most
favourable view only as so many amusing
futilities. He marks his superior success
with a jealous eye; and complains of a
frivolous public. A geometrician can
draw no deductions, and sees nothing
proved, by the finest verses of a poet;
an antiquary marvels that an elegant his∣torian
should be preferred to a chrono∣loger;
and a metaphysician wonders at
the delight communicated by faithful re∣presentations
of human life, written by
one whom he thinks incapable of com∣prehending
a page of Locke.</P>
<P>It will surprise the young and virtuous
reader, when I must also add that the
character is sometimes considered as a
kind of disgrace. To excel in those ac∣complishments
<PB N="7" REF="29"/>
which enlighten or amuse
a polished people, has ceased to be a
merit with some, because of the nume∣rous
claimants for this honour. But it
is with authors as with those military
fops who frequent the theatres, and as∣sume
with their cockade, the title of
captain. Enquire, and you find that
the obstreperous gentleman has been
only an ensign for a week, and often
that he has no claims at all to the bor∣rowed
cockade. Thus with authors, if
the pretenders are discerned, and the
ranks distinguished, a man will reduce
the number to a very inconsiderable por∣tion
of a numerous acquaintance. Every
one who prints a book is not an author;
publication is the test of literature, and
there are an infinite number of works
which are printed, but which all the in∣ventive
industry of the author could
never publish.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="30"/>
Many of that class of society whose en∣tire
nights are rotations of inanity, and
whose days are too short for necessary re∣pose,
blush for a friend who is an au∣thor;
and, as the daughter of Addison
was taught, despise even a parent who
had given to a fashionable and unworthy
woman, an illustrious name. These are
they who gaze in the silence of stupidity
when an unusual topic glides into con∣versation,
and will pardon any species of
rudeness, sooner than that of good sense.</P>
<P>Others know themselves incapacitated
to become authors, and ficken at the re∣collection
of their abortions. Literary
attainments are depreciated, to console
their deficiencies; as bankrupts, out of
mere envy, calumniate the successful
merchant.</P>
<P>There is, however, a race of ingenious
men, who derive their merit and their
fortune from their studies, and yet con∣temn
<PB N="9" REF="31"/>
literature and literary men. This
is a paradox of the heart, of which
the solution may appear difficult. Adrian
VI. obtained the pontificate, as the re∣ward
of his learning; and men of letters,
indulged the most golden hopes, at his
accession; but on the contrary, he con∣temned
literature, and persecuted stu∣dents.
A living orator, whose chief
merit consists in his literary powers, it has
been said, performs in the present day,
the part of Adrian. Such men treat
science, as a barbarous son, who spurns
at that parent, the milk of whose bosom
nurtured him in infancy, and whose
hand supported him in youth. A lite∣rary
friend observes, that the pope feared
lest men of letters might shake the pon∣tificate,
and the orator, lest they might
detect the errors of his politics; an ob∣servation
which shews the political in∣fluence
of authors.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="32"/>
Those to whom nature has bestowed
callous organs, and who are really insen∣sible
to the charms of fancy, or the force
of reason, we pardon; imbecillity must
be accepted as an apology for errors,
since it often is for crimes.</P>
<P>How hard is the fate of the author,
who, when he once publishes, becomes
in the minds of all, whatever they chuse
to make him!</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="11" REF="33"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of Men of Letters.</HEAD>
<P>WE distinguish two kinds of Men
of Letters. Both alike make <HI>their prin∣cipal
occupation</HI> to consist in study; but
the one are induced from many concur∣ring
circumstances not to publish their
labours; and the other devote their life
to communicate their speculations to the
world. Few men of letters reject the
honours of an author, out of modesty;
but some are inert through terror, and
some through ease. The French (rich
in expressions relative to polite letters)
distinguish these learned and tranquil
students, by the happy title of <HI>littera∣teurs.</HI></P>
<P>The popular notion of a man of let∣ters
is as unsettled, as unjust. It is sup∣posed
that because a taylor makes a
<PB N="12" REF="34"/>
fashionable coat, and a builder erects a
house according to modern taste, a man
of letters must therefore produce a book,
adapted to the reigning mode. It is
not necessary that every man of letters
should become an author, though it is
the indispensible duty of an author to be
a man of letters. Some suppose that it
is sufficient when they commence au∣thors,
to study what they write, it would
be advantageous if we write also what we
study; for without learning, few works
are valuable; and he who employs not a
useful cement, will see his brilliant edifice
scattered by the winds, in shining frag∣ments.</P>
<P>The man of letters, is in general, a
more amiable character than the author.
His passions are more ferene, his studies
more regular, his solitude more soothing.
He encounters no concealed or public
enemy, and his tranquillity is not a
<PB N="13" REF="35"/>
feather in the popular gale. Every dis∣covery
he makes is a happy conquest;
every charm of taste a silent enjoyment.</P>
<P>Nor are such characters as the multi∣tude
imagine unuseful in the republic of
letters. To the elegant leisure of these
students we are indebted for many of the
ornaments of literature; and authors
themselves have recourse to these sages,
as their conductors, and sometimes as
their patrons. These men of letters, like
guides over the Alps, though no travel∣lers
themselves, warn the adventurous
explorer of impending danger, and in∣struct
him in his passage.</P>
<P>No literary character is more fre∣quently
amiable than such a man of let∣ters.
The occupations he has chosen,
are justly called the studies of humanity;
and they communicate to his manners,
his understanding, and his heart, that
refined amenity, that lively sensibility,
<PB N="14" REF="36"/>
and that luminous acuteness which flow
from a cultivated taste. He is an enthu∣siast;
but an enthusiast for elegance. He
loves literature, like virtue, for the har∣mony
it diffuses over the passions; and
perceives, that like religion, it has the
singular art of communicating with an
unknown and future state. For the love
of posterity is cherished by these men of
letters; and though they want the energy
of genius to address the public, often for
that public, they labour in silence. It
is they who form public libraries; father
neglected, and nurture infant genius;
project and support benevolent institu∣tions,
and pour out the philanthropy of
their heart, in that world, which they ap∣pear
to have forsaken.</P>
<P>Their mild dispositions first led them
into the province of literature. They
found in books an occupation congenial
to their sentiments; labour without fa∣tigue;
<PB N="15" REF="37"/>
repose with activity; an employ∣ment,
interrupted without inconvenience,
and exhaustless without satiety. They
remain ever attached to their studies;
for to give a new direction to life, would
require a vast effort, and of exertion they
are incapable. Their library and their
chamber are contiguous; and often in
this contracted space, does the opulent
owner consume his delicious hours.—His pursuits are ever changing, and he
enlivens the austere by the lighter stu∣dies.
It was said of a great hunter, that
he did not live, but hunted; and it may
be said of the man of letters, that he
does not live, but meditates. He feels
that pleasing anxiety, which zests desire,
arising from irritative curiosity; and he
is that happy man who creates hourly
wants, and enjoys the voluptuousness of
immediate gratification. The world pity
the man of letters inhumed among his
<PB N="16" REF="38"/>
books, and their mistaken wit inscribes
on his door, <Q REND="inline">here lies the body of our
friend!</Q> Yet unthinking men are not
without excuse; his pleasures are silent
and concealed. Whatever is not tran∣quil
alarms; whatever is serene attracts;
he therefore becomes a Mecenas, but
never a Virgil; protects letters, but never
composes books; a lover of art, but never
an artist.</P>
<P>These men of letters form penetrating
critics, whose taste is habitual, and whose
touch is firm and unerring. Criticism
is happily adapted to their powers of
action; because in criticism they par∣take
of the pleasures of genius, without
the painful exertion of invention; and as
they are incapable of exerting invention,
and direct their studies to form and
polish judgment, this latter faculty is
often more cultivated, and more vigo∣rous,
than even that of men of genius.
<PB N="17" REF="39"/>
Few writers attain to any perfection un∣assisted
by such a connoisseur; the viva∣city
and enthusiasm of genius are indulged
often in violations of delicacy and truth;
and what the author wants is precisely
what this critic can alone give. It is
not to be doubted that the familiar ac∣quaintance
which existed between Racine,
Boileau, and Moliere, was most precious
to them. We know that they commu∣nicated
their arts of composition, and
stood centinels over each other with the
severest and most vigilant eye. Hence
that equable power, and finished elegance
which distinguish their productions.—Corneille, who associated with neither,
and like a sultan would inspire awe, by
concealing himself in solitary grandeur,
lost these invaluable conferences, and
indulged genius careless of the rasures of
taste. Hence his gross defects and ir∣regularities.
In England, where such
<PB N="18" REF="40"/>
an union has been rare, we can trace the
same effects. Pope, Swift, and Boling∣broke,
were of mutual advantage; Pope
had not been a philosopher without the
aid of Bolingbroke; and Swift, an in∣ferior
poet, without the salutary coun∣sels
of Pope. Milton, severed from all
literary friends, has left in his sublime
epics, too many traces of this separation;
and it may be said that his greatest works
contain his greatest blemishes. In the
finished pieces of his youth, when he
had a critical eye at every hour on every
page, we find no want of corrective
touches. Churchill, a great and irre∣gular
genius, with such friends had not
only left his fatires more terfe, and more
harmohious, but had been incapable, in
his feeblest hours, to have so frequently
composed, such a series of unconnected
and prosaic rhimes.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="41"/>
Often, by an excellent discernment,
these critics give a happy direction to
the powers of a young writer. Such
was the observation of Walsh, whose ad∣vice
to Pope, that correctness in our
poetry was the only means which re∣mained
to distinguish himself, animated
the poet, to form that prominent and
beautiful feature in his poetical character.</P>
<P>To prove their great utility to men of
genius, the following instance may serve.
Not always he whose abilities are capable
of adorning the page of history, is alike
capable of discovering the hidden and
perplexed tracks of learned research.
Men of genius rarely read catalogues. To
whom is the philosophic writer of mo∣dern
history to have recourse, but to such
a man of letters? When Robertson pro∣posed
writing his various histories, he
was ignorant of his subject, and irreso∣lute
in his designs. We had nearly lost
<PB N="20" REF="42"/>
his elegant compositions. He confessed
in letters, which I have seen addressed to
Dr. Birch, that <Q REND="inline">he had never access to
copious libraries, nor an extensive
knowledge of authors.</Q> Dr. Birch,
who was an admirable <HI>litterateur,</HI> in his
answer has given a copious and critical
catalogue of proper authors, accompa∣nied
by valuable information, which is
acknowledged by our elegant historian
with warmth. It was certainly that kind
of necessary knowledge, which only the
learning of our scholar could supply, and
without which the project of Robertson's
histories must have perished in the con∣ception.
These students are therefore
useful members in the republic of letters,
and may be compared to those subterra∣neous
streams, which flow into spacious
lakes, and which, though they flow in∣visibly,
enlarge the waters which attract
the public eye.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="43"/>
Sometimes these men of letters dis∣tinguish
themselves by their productions;
but though these may be excellent, they
always rank in the inferior departments
of literature; and they rarely occupy
more than the first place in the second
class. Their works are finished com∣positions
of taste, or eccentric researches
of curiosity, seldom the fervid labours of
high invention. They are ingenious
men, not men of genius. If they pour
forth their effusions in verse, we may
have some delicate opuscula; elaborate
beauties, but not of an original kind.
Such are many of our minor poets, dis∣tinguished
for the refinements, but not
the powers of their art. They may ex∣cel
in happy versions of a classic; of
which we have many admirable proofs.
Their inquiries may be learned, the fruits
of incessant labour, and long leisure;
and they sometimes chuse for their dis∣sertations,
<PB N="22" REF="44"/>
sertations, uncommon topics. These
they treat often with ingenuity, but
chiefly enchant by a seductive manner.
They have a certain glow, like a gentle
and regular fire; but which never flashes
and flames like a powerful inventive
mind. It is rather the fire raised in a
forge, than bursting from a natural vol∣cano.
Such writers are the authors of
those little essays, which are precious to
men of taste; on painting, and on poetry;
on beauty, and on deformity. Elegant
minds, that imbue with elegance light
subjects; their strokes are not continued
and grand, but occasional and brilliant;
and if they rarely excite admiration by
new combinations of reflection or ima∣gery,
often paint, with a mellow warmth,
the beauty of sentiment. In such at∣tempts
they succeed; because they select
their subject, with the fondness of a
lover, and are familiar with its reserved
<PB N="23" REF="45"/>
graces. When unfortunately they at∣tempt
higher topics, which require ele∣vated
conceptions, and fervid genius, we
perceive their feeble energies. Such
writers, like the lark, must only rise on
a playful wing, and resound their favou∣rite
notes; but a man of genius, like a
hawk, elevates himself to discover the
country, and to dart on his prey.</P>
<P>We shall elucidate these reflections by
the character of M. Sacy. He was
modest, ingenious, and sensitive. He
cultivated his talents with ardour, and
soothed the labours of the bar, with the
studies of polite letters. He gave a
version of Pliny, which has not injured
the delicacy of the original. Admitted
to the circle of the Marchioness de Lam∣bert,
he enjoyed the familiarity of men
of genius; and by the sensibility of his
heart, engaged the affections of the
Marchioness more forcibly than even the
<PB N="24" REF="46"/>
genius of superior minds. Animated by
his social enjoyments, he wrote with
amenity, an interesting Essay on Friend∣ship.
In this he succeeded; for no mind
could be more susceptible to it's soft and
domestic raptures. He afterwards com∣posed
an Essay on Glory; but here he
did not succeed. A man of genius alone
can write on such a topic; it requires a
mind that expands from the limits of a
family to a nation; from a nation to the
world; from the world to posterity. Vast
and gigantic operation of the soul! This
is no tranquil sentiment of taste, but an
impetuous passion of genius. A Cicero,
not a Sacy, should have written on
Glory; but Cicero did not feel more
exquisitely than the amiable Sacy, on
the subject of Friendship.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. On some Characteristics of a Youth of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>I PROPOSE to sketch some of the mis∣fortunes
which often attend a writer, or
an artist. Should my picture prove to be
a faithful representation, my feelings will
dispose me to lament my talent.</P>
<P>To what an unknown height might an
adequate education elevate the human
character, if it were possible at his birth
to detect the future genius. The ostrich
has the sagacity to discover in it's eggs,
those which are worthy of her genial
warmth, and separates them from the
rest, which would have proved sterile to
the solicitous cares of a mother. It is not
thus with the human race. If we could
perceive the man of genius, in "the na∣tal
hour," we might select him from
the croud, and nourish the giant, with
<PB N="26" REF="48"/>
the aliment a giant may be supposed to
require. At the age of twenty his ma∣turity
would appear; and he would have
performed at thirty whatever a Horace
or a Livy have done; while the vigour
of life yet remained to shew us something
more exquisite in fancy, and more com∣plicate,
yet clear in reasoning, than at
present we can possibly conceive. But,
alas! it is only the romantic eye of the
poet, which can observe the graces
wreathing his cradle with myrtles. I quit
my fantastic man of genius to descend to
nature and to experience.</P>
<P>It is rather singular that none but
princes, and monsters, have the privi∣lege
or exciting public curiosity at their
birth. A man of genius is dropt among
the people, and has first to encounter the
difficulties of ordinary men, without that
confined talent which is adapted to a
mean destimation. Parents, of honest
<PB N="27" REF="49"/>
dispositions, are the victims of the de∣termined
propensity of a son, to a Virgil
or an Euclid; and the first step into life
of a man of genius is disobedience and
grief.</P>
<P>The frequent situation of such a man
is described with great simplicity, by the
astrologer Lilly, whether he were a man
of genius or not, in the curious memoirs
of his life. He there tells us, that having
proposed to his father that he should
try his fortune in London, where he
hoped his learning and his talents might
prove serviceable to him, he observes
that his father (who was incapable of dis∣covering
his latent genius in his studious
dispositions) very willingly consented to
get rid of him, <Q REND="inline">for I could not <HI>work,</HI>
drive the plough, or endure any coun∣try
labour; my father oft would say I
was <HI>good for nothing.</HI></Q>—The fathers of
most of our men of genius have employed
<PB N="28" REF="50"/>
the same expressions as the father of
Lilly.</P>
<P>An apparent indolence hangs about
contemplative genius; he loves the re∣pose
of the body, and the activity of the
mind. It is known that most men of
great abilities in their puerile days, have
retired from the sports of their mates,
and while they were folded up in their
little wild abstractions, have appeared
dull to dunces. We often hear, from
the early companions or intimates of a
man of genius, that at school he had
been remarkably heavy and unpromising;
but, in truth, he was only remarkably
pensive, and often pertinaciously assi∣duous.
The great Bossuet at school would
never join with his young companions,
but preferred plodding over a book.—They revenged themselves by a boyish
jest of calling him, <HI>bos suetus aratro,</HI> an ox
daily toiling in the plough. It is curious
<PB N="29" REF="51"/>
to observe, that the young painters, to
ridicule the constant labours of Domeni∣chino
in his youth, did him the honour
to distinguish him also by the title of
great Ox. Chatterton offers still a
better, though a more melancholy in∣stance.
It is in this manner that one man
of genius generally resembles another.</P>
<P>This inaction of body, and activity of
mind, they retain throughout life. A
man of genius is rarely enamoured of
common amusements. And the boy who
was unadroit at marbles, and refused sca∣ling
the wall of an orchard, when a man,
seldom excels as an agile hunter, or an
elegant dancer. I am describing the en∣thusiasm
of talent, not it's uninteresting
mediocrity. A man of genius is the
surest testimony on this point. Let us
attend to the minstrel of Dr. Beattie.<Q><PB N="30" REF="52"/>
<L>Concourse, and noise, and toil he ever fled,</L>
<L>Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray</L>
<L>Of squabbling imps; but to the forest sped.</L></Q>
<Q><L>The exploit of strength, dexterity or speed,</L>
<L>To him nor vanity, nor joy could bring.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Would Edwin this majestic scene resign,</L>
<L>For aught the huntsman's puny craft supplies?</L></Q> I repeat, his mind alone has activity.—The fire side in the winter, and some
favourite tree in the summer, will be his
seats; his amusements become studies,
and his meditations are made in his
walks, as well as in his chair. These
are some of the marks which distinguish
him from the man of the world.</P>
<P>We have been able to discover this
disposition in youthful genius; the same
characterises his age. It was thus when
Mecenas, accompanied by Virgil and
Horace, retired one day into the country,
the minister amused himself with a ten∣nis-ball;
the two poets reposed on a
vernal bank, beneath a delicious shade.
<PB N="31" REF="53"/>
Pliny was pleased with the Roman mode
of hunting, which admitted him to sit a
whole day with his tablets and stylus,
that (he says) if I return with empty
nets, my tablets may at least be full.</P>
<P>Among the inauspicious circumstances
which frequently attend the first exertions
of juvenile genius, is the want of sensi∣bility
and discernment, in the literary
man or artist whose regard and counsels
he solicits. Remote from the world of
taste, he cultivates with ardour, but not
with art, talents which tremble in the
feebleness of infancy. When the intel∣lectual
offspring is struggling with pain,
and fear, into existence, the hand that
should aid it's delivery repels with an un∣natural
barbarity. As Churchill says,
<Q>They crush a Bard, just bursting from the shell!</Q>
In these wild hours of youth and fancy,
the juvenile writer roves like an insulated
<PB N="32" REF="54"/>
wanderer. Thrown on an enchanted isle,
his ear listens with an artless impatience
for the celestial tones of an Ariel. It is
his unhappy fate to encounter a brutal
and malicious Caliban. Such has been
the situation of several men of genius
when they first addressed themselves to
an unworthy man of letters for their
protector.</P>
<P>Another unfriendly influence over
young genius is the want of discernment
in those, who have the direction of their
talents. Pope was often heard to say,
that he could learn nothing from his
masters, for they wanted sagacity to dis∣cover
the bent of his genius; and the
preceptors of Thomson, reprimanded the
poet, for being too poetical in some of
his exercises. The judicious Quintilian
observes, that it is not sufficient that a
master instructs his scholars in science;
but he should also cultivate those par∣ticular
<PB N="33" REF="55"/>
good qualities nature has be∣stowed
on each; to add, to those which
are deficient, to correct some, and to
change others.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy truth, that the
period at which men receive the colour
of their life, is that which is generally
least regarded. When we most want
judgment, we have none; and age is
often passed only in lamentations over
youth. The eventful moment which
determines our future years, is min∣gled
and lost among hours which can∣not
be recalled. Physicians tell us,
that there is a certain point in youth, at
which our constitution takes it's form,
and on which the sanity of life revolves.
The existence of genius, experiences a
similar dangerous moment. Taste er∣roneously
directed, or genius unsubdued;
feebleness not invigorated, or vigour not
softened; are the accidents which render
<PB N="34" REF="56"/>
even a superior mind defective in it's
best performances. Children by the neg∣ligence
of their parents become ricketty,
and all their life retain some trace of the
unhappy distortion of their limbs. The
predominant blemishes of an author, if
enquired into, will be found generally to
originate in their indulgence at a time
when they wanted a Quintilian, to deter
them by exercising some contrary quality
to that, of which they were vitiously en∣amoured.
The epigrammatic points, and
swelling thoughts of Young; the remote
conceits of Cowley, and the turgidity of
Johnson, might probably have been
avoided by their authors, had the bent
of their mind at an early period, been
moulded by a critic hand. Few literary
vices are radical, unless permitted to
strike deeply in the soil. Oaks, are but
saplings, till they are suffered to become
oaks.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="57"/>
The peculiarities of genius are often
derived from local habits, or accidental
circumstances; and this remark shews
the unwearied vigilance necessary to be
observed in the progress and formation
of genius. Rembrandt is one instance;
his peculiarity of shade was derived from
the circumstance of his father's mill re∣ceiving
light from an aperture at the top,
which habituated him afterwards to that
singular manner of broad shades. The
same analogy may be traced in the hu∣man
intellect. A man of genius is often
determined to shape his mind into a par∣ticular
form, by the books of his youth.
Dr. Franklin tells us, that when young,
and wanting books, he accidentally found
De Foe's Essay on Projects, from which
work he thinks impressions were derived
that afterwards influenced some of the
principal events of his life. It was by a
studious perusal of Plutarch's illustrious
<PB N="36" REF="58"/>
men, that Rousseau received that gran∣deur
of sentiment which distinguishes all
his compositions, and created him that
romantic and sensitive being he ever re∣mained.</P>
<P>If we except some rare instances, no
writer can display his talents so indispu∣tably
that the world shall be conscious of
his exalted genius, at an early period.
Du Bos and Helvetius have fixed that
great hour in the short day of man, about
the age of thirty; and I recollect an old
Spanish writer lays it down as an axiom,
that no author should publish a book
under the age of thirty-five. It is cer∣tain
that many of our first geniuses,
have not evinced their abilities till forty.
Some indeed spring suddenly like a
flower; while others expand gradually
like a tree. Some are like diamonds
which receive their fine polish from an ela∣borate
<PB N="37" REF="59"/>
art, while others resemble pearls
which are born with their beautiful lustre.</P>
<P>Is it enquired if during this long pe∣riod
a man of genius does not give some
evident marks of his future powers? I
answer that sometimes he does; some∣times
he does not; and sometimes they
are dubious. They are frequently dubi∣ous,
because the grossest pedant attends
to his studies, if not with the same af∣fection,
at least with as much constancy
as the finest genius. Who can distinguish
between pertinacity and genius? It is,
perhaps, impossible to know if a young
student will be a compiler, or an historian.</P>
<P>The first effusions of a man of genius
may be so rude, as were those of Swift
and Dryden, that no reasonable hope
can be formed of his happy progress.
The juvenile productions of many great
writers evince nothing of that perfection
they afterwards obtained; and probably
<PB N="38" REF="60"/>
Raphael when he first shadowed his rude
man, on his father's earthenware, had
not one stroke of that ideal beauty, which
one day his head was to conceive, and
his hand to attempt.</P>
<P>Sometimes a superior mind gives no
evidence of it's great powers; genius
may, like Aeneas, be veiled by a cloud,
and remain unperceived even by it's as∣sociates;
as in the case of Goldsmith,
whom even his literary companions re∣garded
as a compiler, not as a writer of
taste. Hume was considered for his so∣briety
and assiduity, as capable of be∣coming
a good merchant; of Johnson it
was said, that he would never offend in
conversation, and of Boileau, that he had
no great understanding, but would speak
ill of no one. Farquhar, who afterwards
joined to great knowledge of the world,
the liveliest talents, was at college a
heavy companion, and unreasonably dull.
<PB N="39" REF="61"/>
These, from numerous instances, will be
sufficient. Again, when a superior mind
evinces it's early genius, it is not always
done with all it's energy; we have several
who began versifiers, and concluded poets.</P>
<P>It happens, however, that sometimes
genius unequivocally discovers itself in
the puerile age. Some appear to have
meditated on the art they love, on the
bosom of their nurse; and they are pain∣ters
and poets before they know the
names of their colours, and the fabric of
their verse. Michael Angelo, as yet a
child, wherever he went, employed him∣self
in drawing, which so much alarmed
his noble parents, who were fearful their
family might be dishonoured by a man
of genius, that they mingled castigations
with their reprimands. Angelo relin∣quished
the pencil, but it was only to
take the brush. When he attempted
statuary, his father blushed to think his
<PB N="40" REF="62"/>
son was a stone-cutter. Angelo persisted,
and became a great man in opposition to
his noble progenitors. Velasquez, a Spa∣nish
painter, when he performed his
school tasks, filled them with sketches
and drawings; and, as some write their
names on their books, his were known
by exhibiting specimens of his genius.</P>
<P>An observation may be introduced
here which is due to the parents of a man
of genius.</P>
<P>We never read the biography of a
great character, whether he excelled in
letters, or the fine arts, without repro∣bating
the domestic persecution of those,
who opposed his inclinations, and en∣deavoured
to unfeather the tender pinion
of juvenile genius. No poet but is roused
with indignation, at the recollection of
the Port Royal Society thrice burning
the poetical romance, which Racine at
length got by heart; no geometrician
<PB N="41" REF="63"/>
but bitterly criminates the father of
Pascal for not suffering him to read
Euclid, which he at length understood
without reading; no painter, but exe∣crates
the parents of Angelo, for snatch∣ing
the pencil from his hand, though at
length he became superior to every artist.
All this is unjust.</P>
<P>Let us place ourselves in the situation
of a parent of a man of genius, and we
shall find another association of ideas
concerning him than those we have at
present. We see a great man, they a
disobedient child; we see genius, they
obstinacy. The career of genius is rarely
that of fortune; and very often that of
contempt. Even in it's most flattering
aspect, what is it, but plucking a few
brilliant flowers from precipices, while
the reward terminates in the honour?
The anxious parent is more desirous of
his son's cultivating the low-lands where
<PB N="42" REF="64"/>
industry may reap, in silent peace, no
precarious harvest. But I even confess
that many parents are themselves not so
insensible to glory, but that they would
prefer a splendid poverty, to an obscure
opulence; but who is to be certain that
a young man is obeying the solicitation
of true genius, or merely the fondness
for an art, in which he must never be an
artist? Literary men themselves fre∣quently
are averse to encourage the lite∣rary
dispositions of their children.</P>
<P>It is certain that a love for any art, in
youth, is no evidence of genius. The
casual perusal of Spenser, which might
produce a Cowley, has no doubt given
birth to a croud of unknown poets. We
have a considerable number of minor
artists, of all kinds, who never attain to
any degree of eminence, and yet in their
youth felt a warm inclination for their
art. If the impulse of genius, and the
<PB N="43" REF="65"/>
perseverance of desire, if conception and
imitation, could ever be accurately dis∣tinguished
in the philosophy of the mind,
it would be one of the most useful of me∣taphysical
speculations. But philoso∣phers
have not yet agreed of the nature
of genius, for while some conceive it to
be a gift; others think it an acquisition.</P>
<P>We now proceed to some reflections
on the friends of youthful genius.</P>
<P>The friends of a young writer are ge∣nerally
prejudicial. To find a sage
Quintilian in a private circle, is as rare
as to discover a silver mine in Devon∣shire;
it is supposed there are several,
but it is difficult to know where nature
has placed them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is a duty I owe as an individual, not to pass over in silence the mention of Devonshire, which I have long considered as the classical county of England. It has it's poets and it's antiquaries, it's musicians and it's painters. There is, perhaps, in consequence, that diffusion of urbanity in the manners of many of it's chief inhabitants, which graces enlightened opulence. Devonshire has produced more illustrious characters than I believe any other county. A Montesquien and a Du Bos would attribute this to the felicity of the climate, where myrtles grow unsheltered in the open air. And perhaps the air which cherishes myrtles in our northern clime, may have no inconsiderable effect on men. The speculation may not be merely fanci∣ful; here the earth displays a more luxuriant herbage on a softer mould; the skies a brighter azure, and the airs blow with what poets call,
<Q>The silky-soft favonian gale. <BIBL>Young.</BIBL></Q>
A Devonshire poet is the only English bard who has a right to transpose the epithets of Virgil in his de∣scriptions of Spring. It is a soil favourable to myrtles and artists.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="66"/>
We may observe, that the productions
of taste are much more unfortunate than
those of reasoning. Every man has a
tolerable degree of judgment, and with
a slight exertion, atchieves the compre∣hension
of a piece of argument; but
taste is of such rarity, that a long life
may be passed by some, without ever
meeting with a person of that cultured
and sure taste, which can touch and feel
<PB N="45" REF="67"/>
the public opinion, before the public
forms it's opinion.</P>
<P>When a young writer's first essay is
shown, some, through mere inability of
censure, see nothing but beauties; others,
with equal imbecillity can see none; and
others, out of pure malice, see nothing
but faults. Few great writers have been
born in that fortunate and rare circle,
where every man has taste, and some
have candour. A young writer, if he
suffers his mind to float from uncertainty
to uncertainty, will only lose many years
before he discovers the imbecillity and
defective taste of the narrow circle of
his critics.</P>
<P>A young artist must banish despon∣dence,
even in the rudest efforts of art.
He must obey the fervid impulse at the
cost of the pleasures of his age, and the
contempt of his associates. It may also
be no improper habit to preserve his ju∣venile
<PB N="46" REF="68"/>
compositions. By contemplating
them he may perceive some of his pre∣dominant
errors; reflect on the gradual
corrections; resume an old manner more
happily, invent a new one from the old
he had neglected; and often may find
something so fine, among his most irre∣gular
productions, that it may serve to
embellish his most finished compositions.
I cannot but apply to this subject, a
happy simile of Dryden, which a young
writer, in the progress of his studies,
should often recollect.<Q><L>As those who unripe veins in mines explore,</L>
<L>On the rich bed, again, the warm turf lay,</L>
<L>Till time digests the yet imperfect ore,</L>
<L>And knows it will be gold another day.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let him therefore at once supply the
marble, and be himself the sculptor; he
must learn to hew out, to form, and to
polish his genius. He must appeal from
a contracted circle, to the public; and
<PB N="47" REF="69"/>
throughout life, must hold this as a
maxim, if he would preserve the neces∣sary
tranquillity to pursue his studies,
that the opinion of an individual must be
accounted as nothing; not even if this
opinion should appear in print. Helve∣tius
justly observes, what does the opi∣nion
of any individual mean? Only,
that if favourable, he entertains the same
ideas as myself; and if unfavourable,
that we differ.</P>
<P>Who but the public can arbitrate be∣tween
an artist and his critic? Should
even the censures of the critic be just,
and the artist notwithstanding please, it
is an additional evidence, that he is
among the greatest artists. It is thus
with Shakespeare and Churchill.</P>
<P>If several of our first writers had at∣tended
to the sentiments of their friends,
we should have lost some of our most
precious compositions. The friends of
<PB N="48" REF="70"/>
Thomson could discern nothing but
faults in his early productions, not ex∣cepting
his sublime Winter! This poet
of humanity has left a vindictive epi∣gram
against one of these friends, and it
is perhaps the only ill-natured lines, he
ever wrote. He came with impatience
to London, published, and made his
genius known. Voltaire, when his Brutus
was unsuccessful, was advised not to turn
his attention to the stage. He replied to
his friends by writing Zara, Alzire, and
Mahomet. The Mirror when published
in Edinburgh was "fastidiously" re∣ceived;
the authors appealed from Edin∣burgh
to London, and they have pro∣duced
the literary pleasures of thousands!</P>
<P>It is dangerous for a young writer to
resign himself to the opinions of his
friends; it is alike dangerous to pass
them with inattention. What an em∣barrassment!
If he has not an excellent
<PB N="49" REF="71"/>
judgment he will not know what to re∣ject
and what to receive of those varying
opinions; and if he has an excellent
judgment, he wants little of their aid.</P>
<P>A young writer must long and dili∣gently
study his great models without
venturing on the vanity of criticism. He
who begins to analyse before he is ac∣quainted
with the nature of his materials,
like an ignorant chymist, may suppose
he is making experiments, when he is in
the act of injuring his untutored and au∣dacious
hand. He must read for many
years his authors, as some the gospels,
with the same faith and the same admi∣ration.
For what he once wanted in∣tellectual
relish, he will come to admire,
and what he admires he will imitate. He
cannot too often peruse those many criti∣cal
performances which the philosophical
taste of the age has produced. It should
be considered, that by reading an excel∣lent
<PB N="50" REF="72"/>
critic, he receives the knowledge of
many years in a few hours. The dis∣coveries
of art are tardy, and criticism
supplies this deficiency. The more ex∣tensive
an artist's knowledge of what has
been done, the more vast will be his
powers in knowing what to do. Those
who do not read criticism, will not even
merit to be criticised. Yet we have un∣reflecting
students who inquire of the
utility of criticism? Nothing may be
of happier consequence than a habit of
comparing his thoughts and his style
with the compositions of his masters. If
in the comparison, the silent voice of
sentiment exclaims in his heart, <Q REND="inline">I also
am a painter,</Q> it is not improbable
that the young artist may become a Cor∣regio.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This sentiment is nobly expressed by Montesquieu in the close of his preface to his great work on laws. There he says, with a consciousness of mind—<Q REND="inline">I do not think that I have been totally deficient in point of genius. When I have seen what so many great men, both in France and Germany, have writ be∣fore me, I have been lost in admiration, but I have not lost my courage. I have said with Corregio, Ed Io anche son Pittore.</Q></P></NOTE> If in meditating on the con∣fessions
<PB N="51" REF="73"/>
of Rousseau, he recollects that he
has experienced the same sensations from
the same circumstances, and that he has
encountered the same difficulties, and
vanquished them by the same means; he
may hope one day that the world will re∣ceive
him as their benefactor. If in a
constant perusal of the finest writers, he
sees his sentiments sometimes anticipa∣ted,
and in the tumult of his mind as it
comes in contact with their's, new ones
arise, let him prosecute his studies, with
ardour and intrepidity, with the fair
hope, that one day, he may acquire the
talents of a fine writer. Let him then,

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the domestic Life of a Man of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>IF we contemplate the domestic life of
a man of genius, we rarely observe him
placed in a situation congenial to his
pursuits.</P>
<P>The house of a man of letters should
be the sanctuary of tranquillity and vir∣tue.
The moral duties he inculcates,
the philosophic speculations he forms,
and the refinements of taste he discloses,
should be familiar to his domestic circle.
It is then he is great without effort, and
eloquent without art.</P>
<P>The porch and the academy of the
ancients must have communicated an
enthusiasm the moderns can never ex∣perience.
In the golden age of Greece,
a Demosthenes saw himself encompassed
by future orators; and Plato listened to
<PB N="53" REF="75"/>
the plaudits of future philosophers. It
was a moment of delicious rapture, not
felt in the solitary meditations of the
modern philosopher, in whose mind sen∣sations
arise cold and artificial compared
to their burst of sentiment and their fer∣vour
of passion.</P>
<P>Yet a virtuous citizen, amidst the dis∣solution
of manners, may give to his re∣sidence
a Roman austerity, and display
the sublime in life, as well as in compo∣sition.
He may be seated at an attic
supper, and,
<Q>Enjoy, spare feast! a radish and an egg.
<BIBL>Cowper.</BIBL></Q>
Nor is such a purity of manners incom∣patible
with refined passions, and delicacy
of sentiment; a penetrating glance, a
tender pressure, a silent smile, may in∣fuse
into his heart those genuine emo∣tions
which are ever wanted and never
<PB N="54" REF="76"/>
found at tables more splendidly profuse,
and more elegantly crouded. A vene∣rable
parent, a congenial friend, and a
female susceptible of a kindred enthu∣siasm,
are perhaps the utmost number
of happy companions, which a fortunate
man could ever assemble around him.</P>
<P>Is he deprived of these social consola∣tions,
like Johnson, he calls those whose
calamities have exiled them from so∣ciety;
and his house is an assemblage of
the blind, the lame, and the poor. In
the ardour of his emotions, he discovers
that a word is wanting in the vocabulary
of humanity, and like the Abbè de Saint
Pierre, has the honour of fixing a new
word in the language; a word that
serves to explain his own actions—<HI>Bien∣faisance.</HI></P>
<P>His look is serene, for study, not for∣tune,
forms his sole occupation; and
accident cannot injure the stability of his
<PB N="55" REF="77"/>
soul, for virtue has long been a habit.
Is it enquired why this man appears an
anomalous being among his fellow citi∣zens?—Because he is the contemporary
of the greatest men. He passes his morn∣ings
with Cicero and Demosthenes, and
gives his nights to Socrates and Plato.</P>
<P>Such an one is the living exemplar of
that sublime morality which we learn
with our latin at school, and which, when
we come into the world, we consider,
like our latin, to be merely a dead lan∣guage.</P>
<P>He renders poverty illustrious, and
proves that every man may be indepen∣dent.
But we would be independent
only, in commanding slaves. He who
lives like a Spartan in voluptuous Sybaris,
is, however, independent; and this age
has produced men who passed the fer∣vours
of youth in a philosophical severity,
and studied (as some study a language)
<PB N="56" REF="78"/>
to become great characters. Such were
Franklin and Elliot, Chatham and
Hume!</P>
<P>The actions and studies of such men
are not the only utility they bestow on
the world; they leave something of a
more diffusive energy; they leave the
eternal memory of their CHARACTER;
they leave to remotest posterity their im∣mortal
vestiges, while virtuous youth
contemplates them with enthusiasm, and
follows them with confidence.</P>
<P>We close any further reflections on the
character of a philosophic writer, and
restrain ourselves to observations more
obvious, and to facts more usual.</P>
<P>Too often we see the sublimest minds,
and the tenderest hearts, sublime and
tender only in their productions. They
are not surrounded by persons of ana∣logous
ideas, who are alone capable of
drawing forth their virtues and affec∣tions;
<PB N="57" REF="79"/>
as the powers of the magnet re∣main
dormant unless applied to particles
capable of attraction. We hear of seve∣ral
great men, that they were undutiful
sons—because they displeased their fa∣thers
in becoming great men—that they
were disagreeable companions—because
dullness or impertinence wearied—that
they were indifferent husbands—because
they were united to women who did no
honour to the sex. These are ordinary
accusations, ever received, while it is
forgotten that an accusation is not al∣ways
a crime.</P>
<P>It were not difficult to describe the
domestic life of most men of genius, and
to observe that their inmates have ren∣dered
their Lares but rugged deities. I
would never draw conclusions from par∣ticular
circumstances, such as, that Ad∣dison
describes his lady under the
character of Oceana, and Steele deline∣ates
<PB N="58" REF="80"/>
his wife under that of Miss Prue;
the one was a stormy ocean, and the
other a stagnated stream. But I re∣mark
that many of the conspicuous
blemishes of some of our great compo∣sitions
may reasonably be attributed to
the domestic infelicities of their authors.
The desultory life of Camoens probably
occasioned the want of connection in his
Epic; Milton's distracted family those
numerous passages which escaped era∣sure;
and Cervantes may have been led,
through the haste of publication, into
those little slips of memory observable
in his Satirical Romance. The best
years of Meng's life were embittered by
the harshness of his father; and it is
probable that this domestic persecution,
from which he was at length obliged to
fly, gave him those morose and saturnine
habits which he ever afterwards retained.
Of Alonso Cano, a celebrated Spanish
<PB N="59" REF="81"/>
painter, it is observed by Mr. Cumber∣land,
that he would have carried his art
much higher, had not the unceasing per∣secution
of the inquisitors deprived him
of that tranquillity which is so necessary
to the very existence of the fine arts.
Our poetry had probably attained to it's
acmè, before Pope, had the unfortu∣nate
circumstances of Dryden not occa∣sioned
his inequalities, his incorrectness,
and his copious page.</P>
<P>It is therefore an interesting observa∣tion
for a man of letters, and an artist,
to liberate himself early from domestic
anxieties. Let him, like Rousseau, leave
the rich financier, (though he might be∣come
one himself,) sell his watch, and
issue from the palace, in independence
and enthusiasm. He must also, if ne∣cessary,
like Crebillon, be satisfied with
the respectable society of a considerable
<PB N="60" REF="82"/>
number of grey hounds,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Crebillon passed much of his life in solitude, and pleased himself with the company of a dozen fine large dogs in his room, which rendered the approach to our poet as formidable to the timorous, as to the delicate.</NOTE> The most ar∣dent
passion for glory can alone stimulate
to such a retirement; and indeed it is
only in solitude that the most eminent
geniuses have been formed. Solitude is
the nurse of enthusiasm, and enthusiasm
is the parent of genius. Literary solitude
shall therefore form our next object for
speculation.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="61" REF="83"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. On Literary Solitude.</HEAD>
<P>MEN of Letters are reproached with
an extreme passion for retirement; and
some of the warmest philanthropists are
calumniated as haters of the human race.</P>
<P>Literary Retirement can have no guilt,
even if merely passed, in the uninter∣rupted
examination of the treasures of
literature. When taste is formed, and
curiosity becomes habitual, the mind
will not forego gratifications at once sa∣cile
and exquisite. If it is said why the
same ingenuity of mind, that loves to
trace the cause, and to arrange the ef∣fects,
is not turned to the objects of the
times, and thus render itself of more
apparent utility, I answer, that in the
contemplation of existing scenes, the
mind finds not the same gratification as
<PB N="62" REF="84"/>
in those of the past. What is present is
not yet terminated; the folly of the age
is not yet folly, and judgment pauses
over mysterious passions. But in the
history of the human mind, to be calmly
traced in the volumes of other times,
every illusion is dissipated; and we re∣ceive
the same pleasure, as the spectator
who beholds the catastrophe of the tra∣gedy,
or the comedy, which excited his
curiosity. The history of the past yields
a conclusion, and therefore a perfection
which cannot accompany that of the
present.</P>
<P>The horizon of Research is illimitable,
and the discoveries of Truth are infinite.
New materials serve but as the founda∣tions
of others; we do not remain sa∣tisfied
with building a house, a palace,
or a street; but by impereeptible gra∣dations
we erect a city.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="85"/>
This, perhaps, may serve as an apo∣logy
for Men of Letters, who consume
their days with innocence and philoso∣phy;
but who are frequently considered
to withdraw from duties which those
who live to bustle, and those who bustle
to live, are very far themselves from
practising. An active virtue, which in
the present day may be called heroism,
is frequently the amiable child of Soli∣tude,
but rarely the companion of the
busy and the gay.</P>
<P>I propose to shew the necessity, the
pleasures, and the inconveniencies of So∣litude,
to those who enlighten the world
from the obscurity of their retirement.</P>
<P>Solitude is indispensable for literary
pursuits. Every poet repeats,<Q>Carmina secessum scribentis et otia quaerunt.</Q> No considerable work has yet been com∣posed,
but it's author, like an ancient
<PB N="64" REF="86"/>
magician, retired first to the grove or
the closet, to invocate his spirits. Every
composition of genius is the production
of enthusiasm; and while enthusiasm
agitates the mind, the solitude of a man
of letters resembles a scene of antient
Greece; a grove becomes sacred, and
in every retired spot a divinity appears.</P>
<P>But it's enchantments are reserved
alone for him. When he sighs for the
intellectual decencies, and the grace of
fancy, and languishes in an irksome so∣litude
among crouds, that is the moment
to fly into seclusion and meditation. He
alone experiences the delights of that
day, which is compressed into a few
hours. Where can he indulge, but in
solitude, the delicious romances of his
soul? And where but in solitude can he
occupy himself in useful dreams by night,
and when the morning rises, fly, with∣out
interruption, to his unfinished la∣bours?
<PB N="65" REF="87"/>
He finds many secret pleasures,
and some glowing anticipations. There
is a society, in the deepest solitude, to
which a polished mind springs with ar∣dour;
it embraces a thousand congenial
sentiments, and mingles with a thousand
exquisite sensations. The solitude of
retirement to the frivolous presents a vast
and dreary desert; but to the man of
genius it blooms like the enchanted gar∣den
of Armida.</P>
<P>Such is the situation in which the poet
of sentiment and nature, amidst the
works of his masters, exclaims<Q>First of your kind, Society divine!
<BIBL>Thomson.</BIBL></Q> In this stillness of soul, nature seems
more beautiful, and more vast. We
observe men of genius, in public situa∣tions,
sighing for this solitude; it is
there only they feel their superiority,
<PB N="66" REF="88"/>
and live in a future age. Cicero was
uneasy amidst applauding Rome, and he
has distinguished his numerous works
by the titles of his various villas, where
they were composed. It will not be de∣nied
that Voltaire had talents and a taste
for society; yet he not only withdrew
by intervals, but at one period of his
life passed five years in the most secret
seclusion, and perseverance of study.
Montesquieu quitted the brilliant circles
of Paris for his books, his meditations,
and for his immortal work; and for this
he was ridiculed by the gay triflers he
relinquished. Harrington, to compose
his Oceana, severed himself from the
society of his friends, and was so wrapt
in abstraction, that he was pitied as a
lunatic.</P>
<P>A heart thus disposed, tears itself,
with reluctance, from it's contempla∣tions,
and comes into society without a
<PB N="67" REF="89"/>
possibility of receiving, or producing it's
pleasures. It may be urged that several
men of genius have found no difficulty
to level themselves to ordinary under∣standings.
I have heard that Hume
found great delight in the society of two
old maids, at his evening whist; Fonte∣nelle
and La Motte would patiently
listen to the frivolous and the dull; but
Fontenelle and La Motte, whose genius
our historian's greatly resembled, were
two ingenious Frenchmen, celebrated
for their politeness and their wit, not
for their sensibility and enthusiasm.</P>
<P>When a man of letters seeks the con∣solations
of society, he would rest a
mind enfeebled with one continued pur∣suit;
or exercise it by suffering it to take
those infinite directions which the diver∣sities
of conversation offer. If it is wea∣ried,
the simplest actions please; it is a
child that would sport with flowers and
<PB N="68" REF="90"/>
pebbles; if it issues in all it's force, it
is an athlet that leaps in the arena, and
calls for an adversary. It is Montaigne
sporting with his cat, or Johnson main∣taining
a thesis amidst his marvelling
friends.</P>
<P>In either case, ordinary society offers
no charms, and can never be charmed.
A feeble mind knows not to unbend,
because it was never yet extended; nor
can it elevate itself because the soul, ac∣cording
to the figure of Plato, has no
wings.</P>
<P>Thus the mind of genius feels a con∣tinued
irritation in the croud. Let us
attend to the expressions of genius,
which can best describe it's peculiar sen∣sibilities.
Petrarch frequently with∣drew
to his immortal valley, alike dis∣gusted
with the grossness of the vulgar,
and the frivolity of the courtier; he
could not patiently suffer that Being, whom
<PB N="69" REF="91"/>
he calls 'un huom del vulgo!' Cowley
regarded the common people as he did
beasts, and was displeased as much with
what he calls <Q REND="inline">the great as the little
vulgar.</Q> Among the perverted images
of a living orator, is that <Q REND="inline">of the hoofs
of the swinish multitude,</Q> and a ve∣nerable
ancient prefers the society of his
dog to such men. Fools (cries Du Clos)
reconcile men of genius to each other;
from the impossibility of living with
fools. And to close our testimonies, with
a fine expression from Milton,
<Q><L>Among unequals what society</L>
<L>Can sort, what harmony or true delight?</L></Q></P>
<P>The interruption of visitors have been
feelingly lamented by men of letters.—The mind, occupied in maturing it's
speculations, feels the approach of the
visitor by profession, as the sudden gales
of an eastern blast, passing over the blos∣soms
<PB N="70" REF="92"/>
of spring. We are afraid, said
some of the visitors to Baxter, that we
break in upon your time. To be sure
you do, replied the disturbed and blunt
scholar. Ursinus was laborious in his
literary avocations, and to hint as gently
as he could to his friends, that he was
avaricious of time; he placed an in∣scription
over the door of his study, de∣siring,
that if any one chused to remain,
they must join in his labours. The ami∣able
Melancthon, incapable of a harsh
expression, when he received these idle
visits, only noted down the time he had
expended, that he might reanimate his
industry, and not lose a day. Among
the disturbers of domestic tranquillity,
may be classed those unhappy wanderers
who besiege the houses of their neigh∣bours,
and like the barbarian soldier,
enter the apartment of an Archimedes,
and murder him in the midst of his
studies.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="93"/>
But I am how to sketch a different
picture of literary solitude.</P>
<P>Zimmerman has composed an elabo∣rate
work on Solitude, in a general
manner. His sentiments are glowing,
and perhaps they are dangerous. Of
solitude, men of genius must always be
sufficiently enamoured, without having
read that seducing description of it's
sublime pleasures. Let us not, how∣ever,
forget nature in enthusiasm. A
man of genius, though he addresses pos∣terity,
has sensibilities and desires which
can only be gratified by his contempo∣raries.
When great minds cannot readily
find that in the world they seek, they
hasten into seclusion. The craving void
remains unfilled; and for him who sighs
for popularity in solitude, every hour
sharpens desire, and aggravates disap∣pointment.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="94"/>
The solitude which is sought by the
young student is not borne without re∣pining.
To tame the fervid wildness of
youth, to the strict regularities of study,
is a sacrifice which requires all the en∣thusiasm
of the sincerest votary. The
Academic Bower is not without it's rainy
days. Milton, not apt to vent com∣plaints,
appears to have felt this irksome
period of life. He employs these ex∣pressions
in the preface to Smectymnus.
<Q REND="inline">It is but justice, not to defraud of due
esteem the <HI>wearisome labours</HI> and <HI>studious
watchings,</HI> wherein I have spent, and
<HI>tired out,</HI> almost a whole youth.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps solitude in a later period of
life, or rather the neglect which attends
that solitude, is felt with more sensibi∣lity.
It was thus that Cowley, that en∣thusiast
for rural seclusion, in his retire∣ment
called himself "the melancholy
Cowley;" and Mr. Mason has judici∣ously
<PB N="73" REF="95"/>
transferred the same epither to
Gray. Can we read his letters, and not
feel it's justness? we lament also, the
loss of Cowley's correspondence, through
the mistaken notion of Sprat, a loss cer∣tainly
as invaluable, as irrecoverable.
These are the best memoirs of a man's
heart; the register of his feelings. But
Shenstone has filled his pages with the
cries of an amiable heart that bleeds in
the oblivion of solitude. In one of his
letters, are these melancholy expres∣sions:
"Now I am come from a visit,
every little uneasiness is sufficient to in∣troduce
my whole train of melancholy
considerations, and to make me utterly
dissatisfied with the life I now lead, and
the life I foresee I shall lead. I am an∣gry,
and envious, and dejected, and fran∣tic,
and disregard all present things as
becomes a madman to do. I am infi∣nitely
pleased (though it is a gloomy joy)
<PB N="74" REF="96"/>
with the application of Dr. Swift's com∣plaint,
that he is forced to die in a rage,
like a poisoned rat in a hole." Without
exciting similar passages in prose, let
the lover of solitude muse on it's picture
throughout the year, in the following
stanza.<Q><L>Tedious again to curse the drizzling day!</L>
<L>Again to trace the wintery tracks of snow!</L>
<L>Or soothed by vernal airs again survey,</L>
<L>The self-same hawthorns bud, and cowslips blow.</L></Q></P>
<P>Swift's letters paint a terrifying picture
of solitude, and at length his despair
closed with idiotism. The amiable
Gresset, could not sport with the bril∣liant
wings of his fancy, without some
querulous expressions of an irksome soli∣tude.
In his "Epistle to his Muse,"
he thus exquisitely paints the situation
of men of genius.<Q><L>—Je les vois, victimes du genie,</L>
<L>Au foible prix d'un eclat passager,</L>
<L>Vivre isolès sans jouir de la vie.</L></Q> <PB N="75" REF="97"/>
And afterwards he adds,<Q>Vingt ans d'Ennuis pour quelque jours de gloire!</Q></P>
<P>The following anecdote may amuse
the reader. When Menage was attacked
by some, and abandoned by others, in
a splenetic humour, he retreated into the
country, and gave up his famous Mer∣curiales,
when the literati assembled at
his house. He expected to find that
tranquillity in the country which he had
frequently described in his verses; but,
as he was only a poetical plagiarist, it is
not wonderful that he was greatly dis∣appointed.
Some malicious person hav∣ing
killed his pigeons, it gave him more
vexation than his critics. He hastened
his return to Paris. It is better, he
cried, since we are born to suffer, to feel
only reasonable sorrows.</P>
<P>It is reasonably to be suspected, that
he only prefers solitude, who cannot ac∣complish
<PB N="76" REF="98"/>
his wishes in society. I have
not yet been able to discover a great ge∣nius,
who, courted by an attentive world,
persisted in his retirement. Voltaire,
when his reputation was not yet esta∣blished,
sees only happiness in seclusion;
all his letters abound with quotations
from the poets, of the raptures of soli∣tude.
When his tragedies gave him ce∣lebrity,
then his letters sound a different
strain, and he hesitates not to declare to
his friends, how unhappy was his situ∣ation;
constrained to remain in solitude
while his tragedies were acting every
night at Paris.</P>
<P>To have stood insulated amidst society
has been the hard fate of some whose
presence would have embellished the
most select. This neglect of the world
has inspired their compositions with a
querulous sensibility; a softening charm,
that whatever it may have cost their
<PB N="77" REF="99"/>
feelings, renders their beautiful lamenta∣tions
more interesting. The tender
shades of melancholy throw a grace
amidst the brilliant lights of their fancy.
It is said that the nightingale, with a
thorn in her breast, does not sing with
a less enchanting melody. Is not the
voice of the heart heard in these verses?<Q><L>Poor moralist! and what art thou?</L>
<L>A solitary fly.</L>
<L>No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets.</L>
<BIBL>Gray.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On the whole it may be said, that a
great experience of the world, united
with a great love of virtue, render soli∣tude
desirable. When they exist sepa∣rately,
it becomes irksome. A great
experience of the world, without virtue,
will pine in solitude, to exert it's talent
on those who are simple and unexperi∣enced.
A great love of virtue, without
experience of the world, forms in the
leisure of retirement, those utopian pro∣jects,
which it pants to call into existence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. On the Meditations and Conversations of
Men of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>A CONTINUITY of attention is one of
the grand characteristics of genius, and
in proportion to the degree of the in∣tenseness
of abstraction are it's powers
often obtained. A work on ABSTRAC∣TION,
or the ART OF MEDITATION, is a
desideratum. It would be a valuable
present to all, and might prove of im∣mense
advantage to him, who never had
more than one solitary idea.</P>
<P>Among the regulations of this art, it
might not be improper to recommend
darkness. Several profound thinkers,
could never pursue the operations of
their minds, in the distraction of light,
when the least remission of thought pro∣duces
a new object, and an extraneous
<PB N="79" REF="101"/>
idea. Mallebranche and others, closed
their shutters when they wished to ab∣stract
themselves. That darkness is a
great aid to thinking, would appear from
what most men experience relative to
their thoughts during the night. The
silence and obscurity of that time are
most friendly to abstraction, and often
when sleep forsakes us, and we muse, our
thoughts surprise by the vividness of
fancy. If at that moment, in the words
of one of our most elegant poems, we
do not,
<Q>Snatch the faithless fugitives to light.
<BIBL>Pleasures of Memory.</BIBL></Q>
If Memory does not chain the children
of Imagination, they are scattered, and
fly the beams of the morning. Our mind,
among a tumultuous croud, suddenly
finds itself forsaken and solitary. It is at
that unregarded period of our existence,
<PB N="80" REF="102"/>
that men of moderate capacities feel an
extraordinary expansion, and men of
genius some of their most original com∣binations.
Yet then, how few, like Pope,
have an old woman at hand, to bring
pens and paper!</P>
<P>Men of genius must consider them∣selves
as so many vigilant guardians of
the infinity of nature. So treacherous is
Recollection, and so capriciously does
Memory supply her treasures to Fancy,
that some of the happiest conceptions of
genius are fortuitous; they come, we do
not know from where, and spring we
do not know how; but if not seised at
the moment of perception, they are like
autumnal clouds, whose romantic figures
dissolve, as we gaze.</P>
<P>It is said that collections have been
made, small ones no doubt, of bon mots
by persons who never said but one good
thing; it would form no incurious mis∣cellany,
<PB N="81" REF="103"/>
if it were possible to select some
of those thoughts of great thinkers,
which were never written. We should
find many admirable ones. The painters
have this advantage over writers, their
slightest sketches are immediately siesed,
and become as valuable to posterity as
their more complete labours.</P>
<P>The ART OF MEDITATION is an art
which we may incessantly exercise, and
need not remit for long intervals of re∣pose,
as every other art. And yet, not∣withstanding
the facility of practice, and
we should suppose the hourly skill we
might obtain, every manual art, is
brought to perfection, while of the art
of the mind, millions are yet ignorant
of the first rudiments. Quintilian finely
observes, that men of genius command
it at all times, and in all places. In
their walks, at table, and at assemblies,
they turn their eye inwards, and can
<PB N="82" REF="104"/>
form an artificial solitude. The powers
of abstraction, which some men have
exercised, appear to puny thinkers to
have something of the marvellous; in
the regions of the mind, they look like
so many Gullivers among a million of
Lilliputians. Of Socrates it is said, that
he would frequently remain an entire day
and night in the same attitude, absorbed
in meditation; and why shall we doubt
this when we know that La Fontaine
and Thomson, Descartes and Newton,
experienced the same abstraction? In
Cicero's Treatise on Old Age, Cato
praises Caius Sulpitius Gallus, who,
when he sat down to write in the morn∣ing,
was surprised by the evening, and
when he took up his pen in the evening,
was surprised by the appearance of the
morning. Of the Italian poet Marini,
it is said, that he was once so absorbed
in the revision of his Adonis, that he
<PB N="83" REF="105"/>
suffered his leg to be burnt, for some
time, without any sensibility.</P>
<P>This enthusiasm renders every thing
that surrounds us as distant as if an im∣mense
interval separated us from the
scene. It is related of a modern astro∣nomer,
that one summer night when he
was withdrawing to his chamber, the
brightness of the heavens shewed a phe∣nomenon.
He passed the whole night in
observing it, and when they came to
him early in the morning and found him
in the same attitude, he said, like one
who had been recollecting his thoughts
for a few moments, <Q REND="inline">it must be thus;
but I'll go to bed before 'tis late.</Q> He
had gazed the entire night in meditation
and did not know it.</P>
<P>Enthusiasm, which is active genius,
presents an object more singular than
genius in it's quiescent meditations. The
flowing stream is lost in an ocean rolling
<PB N="84" REF="106"/>
impetuously. This phrenzy of abstrac∣tion,
and wonderful agitation of the
soul, is required not only in the fine arts,
but wherever a great exertion must be
employed. It was felt by Gray in his
loftiest excursions; and is it not the
same power which impels the villager,
when to astonish his rivals, in a contest
for leaping, he retires back some steps,
ferments his mind to a fervent resolu∣tion,
and clears the eventful bound? It
was a maxim with one of our ancient and
great Admirals, in the reign of Eliza∣beth,
that a height of passion, amounting
to phrenzy, was necessary to qualify a
man for that place. A variety of in∣stances
might be given of this fine en∣thusiasm,
which has ever accompanied
the artist, at the moment he produced
excellencies.</P>
<P>It has sometimes arisen into a delirium.
The soul of Rousseau was bewildered in
<PB N="85" REF="107"/>
the delusions of fancy, and the momen∣tary
dispositions of his mind coloured
exterior objects. Petrarch in that mi∣nute
narrative of a vision in which Laura
appeared to him, and Tasso in the con∣versations
with his invisible spirit, ex∣panded
their sublime imaginations to a
dangerous phrenzy. This delicious ine∣briation
of the heart, occasions so intense
a delight, that to describe this character
of the soul, requires, what one of these
exquisite minds has called
<Q>Thoughts that breathe and words that burn!</Q>
The ancients saw nothing short of a di∣vine
inspiration in this agitation of the
mind. It affects men of genius physi∣cally.
Fielding says, <Q REND="inline">I do not doubt
but that the most pathetic and affecting
scenes have been writ with tears!</Q>
He, perhaps, would have been pleased
to have confirmed his observation, by
<PB N="86" REF="108"/>
the following circumstance. Metastasio
has written a beautiful Sonnet, on occa∣sion
of having shed tears in writing an
Opera.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Sonnet shall be given at the close of the volume.</NOTE> When the first idea of the
Essay on the Arts and Sciences rushed
on the contemplation of Rousseau, it oc∣casioned
such a fever of the mind, and
trembling of his frame, that it ap∣proached
to a delirium. The tremors
of Dryden, after having written an Ode,
(a circumstance accidentally handed to
us by tradition) were probably not un∣usual
with him.</P>
<P>Chance has preserved but a few of
similar instances; this enthusiasm, in∣deed,
can only be observed by men of
genius themselves; but when it most
powerfully agitates them, they can least
perceive it. At that moment of exqui∣site
extravagance, like a religious visi∣onary,
they pierce into "the heaven of
<PB N="87" REF="109"/>
heavens," and when they return to
their chair and their table, the effect has
ceased, and the golden hour of sublime
rapture must terminate like other hours,
in vulgar appetites that offend Fancy
and gratify Nature.</P>
<P>This irritability of mind has some∣times
rendered society displeasing to se∣veral
men of genius. Whenever Rousseau
passed a morning in company, he says,
it was observed that in the evening he
was dissatisfied and disturbed. Rousseau
may be considered by some, as a mind
too peculiar, to be taken as a guide in
our examination into the character of
men of genius. If our young authors,
however, would meditate on certain
parts of his character, their virtues might
be more elevated, and their style more
exquisite, than the model which any
other literary character of this age pre∣sents
to them.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="110"/>
Absorbed in his meditations, the man
of genius lives in one continued series of
reflection; always himself, seldom ano∣ther;
frequently the real artist loves
nothing but his art, and his very amuse∣ments
and relaxations receive the im∣pression
of this enthusiasm. Not without
an apparent haughtiness, which often is
but the natural and dignified expression
of an elevated mind; and he appears
awkward or ignorant of those petty at∣tentions
which form the science of those
who have no science. A great Princess
was desirous of seeing one of the first
Literary Characters of the age; her dis∣appointment
was inconceivable; he sat
awkwardly and silently on his chair, and
made the most perplexed bow, she had
yet seen.</P>
<P>We often view the man of real genius
insulated in a brilliant circle; while the
intriguing and fashionable author, whose
<PB N="89" REF="111"/>
heart is more corrupt than his head, is
admired because he has discovered the
art of admiring. The triflers consider
him to be a man of genius; he employs
their own ideas; both are therefore
gratified.</P>
<P>It is however certain, that this ab∣straction
and awkwardness which render
a man of genius ridiculous and incon∣siderable
in the private circle, are the
cause of his success with the public.
Often his private defects are the source
of his public qualities; his bluntness may
be a lively perception of truth; his cold∣ness
a rigid candour; his tedious dis∣cussion
may be an accuracy of reasoning,
and his disagreeable warmth the ardour
which animates his works with the pub∣lic.
It was the excessive vanity and
self-love of Cicero and Voltaire, that gave
birth to all their vast designs. To please
the public, and his circle is incompa∣tible
<PB N="90" REF="112"/>
—to this the frivolous will not assent—when of their numerous body one ac∣complished
trifler shall be acknowledged
as a great genius, this observation shall
be deemed erroneous. But to close a
dispute of the most ancient date, I shall
quote the remark of a <HI>Lord.</HI> Shaftes∣bury
(for nobility loses it's title and often
it's rank in the republic of letters) has
said, <Q REND="inline">that it may happen that a person
may be so much the worse author for
being the finer gentleman.</Q></P>
<P>Many reasons may be alledged why
genius is defective in ordinary conver∣sation;
one may be sufficient; the want
of analogous ideas. The spirit of fashi∣onable
society and that of study, are in∣compatible.
The language of the politest
circle may be defined the art of speaking
idly to an idler. To speak idly, is not an
acquirement of facility. A man of ge∣nius
is rarely versant in the fashionable
<PB N="91" REF="113"/>
vocabulary, and in a dialogue of elegant
inanity, which should be rapid and
various, he hesitates to find a remote
idea, and stops to correct an imperfect
expression. How often will it be fortu∣nate
for him if he escapes being un∣derstood!
It is rather singular that our
polished society should bear so close a
resemblance to the conversations of the
Hottentots—of the Hottentots?—Yes!
for we are told that they consider <HI>think∣ing</HI>
as the scourge of human nature.</P>
<P>The refined sensibility of men of ge∣nius,
renders them uneasy companions.
They discover a character too early, and
too sagaciously, for the interests of con∣versation.
Dunces are excellent com∣panions
for dunces; the same ideas, and
the same judgments; the opacity of the
intellect is no detriment, for, like the
blind, they can perform their stated
rounds in the night without incon∣venience.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="114"/>
A man of genius can rarely be a fa∣vourite
with such a party, even if they
should have some taste and some infor∣mation.
His works they applaud, be∣cause
that is fashionable, but they neg∣lect
the author, who may happen to be
very unfashionable.</P>
<P>The frivolist author will be the even∣ing
favourite; he sports not without
grace on the brilliant surface of the soul;
but is irrecoverably lost when he passes
over it's depths; the swan that grace∣fully
glides down rivers, would perish on
seas. The man of genius sits like a me∣lancholy
eagle whose pinions are clip∣ped,
and who is placed to roost among
domestic fowls.</P>
<P>A man of genius utters many things
in conversation which appear extrava∣gant
or absurd; when printed they are
found admirable. How often the public
differs from the individual; there may
<PB N="93" REF="115"/>
be a century's opinion betwixt them.
This reflection reminds me of an Athe∣nian
anecdote. A statuary at Athens,
made a figure of Minerva. Those friends
who were admitted into his shop (an
ancient custom the moderns preserve)
were surprised at it's rough strokes and
colossal features. Before the artist they
trembled for him; behind him they ca∣lumniated.
The man of genius smiled
at the one, and forgave the other. When
the figure was fixed in a public place,
and inspected by the city, and not merely
by individuals, the attic judges admired
the softness of the traits, and the majesty
of the figure. We must never forget
that there is a certain distance, at which
opinions, as well as statues, are to be
viewed; and he who addresses an attic
public, knows, that it's enlightened sen∣timents,
are rarely to be found in a pri∣vate
circle.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="116"/>
It is not necessary to produce instances
of the deficiencies of men of genius in
conversation. It is sufficient to observe,
that the sublime Dante was taciturn or
satirical; Addison and Moliere were
silent; Corneille and Dryden were no
amusing companions. Vaucanson was
said to be as much a machine as any he
made.</P>
<P>To the intimates of these superior men,
who complained of their defects, I would
thus have replied—Do their productions
not delight and surprise you?—You are
silent; I beg your pardon. The <HI>public</HI>
has informed you of a great name; you
would not otherwise have perceived the
precious talent of your neighbour.—You
have examined his compositions; and
would you have him resemble <HI>yourselves?</HI>
You know nothing of your friend but his
<HI>name.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="117"/>
A man of genius may, however, be
rendered the most agreeable companion.
Few artists but are eloquent on the art
in which they excel. He is an exquisite
instrument if the hand of the performer
knows to call forth the rich confluence
of his sounds. If,<Q>The flying fingers touch into a voice.
<BIBL>D'Avenant.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>If you love the man of letters, seek
him in the privacies of his study; or if
he be a man of virtue, take him to your
bosom. It is in the hour of confidence
and tranquillity, his genius may elicit a
ray of intelligence, more fervid than the
labours of polished composition.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Men of Genius limited in their Art.</HEAD>
<P>WE have examined in the preceding
Chapter several reasons why men of ge∣nius
are often incapable of pleasing in
the versatile conversation of a mixed so∣ciety.
Another observation offers; their
powers of pleasing are even limited in
the art in which they excel. They are
confined (says Du Bos) to particular
branches in that art.</P>
<P>This observation, reiterated without
effect, has become trite, while it would
appear by most authors, considering
themselves universal geniuses, that it was
on the contrary, a dangerous novelty.
Literary history continually confirms it's
verity; and these failures of eminent men
are so many instructions which Nature
dictates; but her pupils receive her ad∣monitions
with contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="119"/>
Nature is "a jealous God," and seve∣ral
of our great writers when they have
risen in rebellion against her, have only
suffered by the violation. Fielding, ex∣cellent
in his novels, when his aid was
required for the theatre, could never
write a tolerable drama. Congreve, ce∣lebrated
for his pointed wit, when he
took up the reigning topic, wrote the
feeblest verse; Rowe, successful in the
soft tones of tragedy, is remarkable for
a miserable failure in comedy; La Fon∣taine,
that exquisite fabulist, found that
his opera was hissed. The absurdities of
Voltaire, the most successful of universal
writers, are only forgiven for his inex∣haustible
wit and happy irony.</P>
<P>The most original genius of our age,
with discernment equal to his wit, con∣fines
himself to that species of poetry in
which he can fear no rival. Songs, more
delicious than the odes of Anacreon, and
<PB N="98" REF="120"/>
satires, more pungent than those of
Horace; compositions more admirable
than imitable; these are the limits which,
like a great politician, he draws round
his empire. He has no disposition to
rival Milton in an epic, or Shakespeare
in a tragedy. Peter Pindar will never,
therefore, experience the fate of Louis
the Great; to make brilliant conquests
in the prime of life, and view his repu∣tation
die before himself, by a vain at∣tempt
at universal monarchy.</P>
<P>But some ingenious men are willing to
oppose this precept, and presume to
think that Nature is never ungrateful,
when she receives the proper attentions.
It is not difficult to find some ingenious
artists, who shew abilities in various
modes of composition; but to evince
<HI>abilities,</HI> and to display <HI>genius,</HI> are re∣moved
at a long interval from each other.
True genius has rarely this suppleness;
<PB N="99" REF="121"/>
but what the French call <HI>le bel esprit,</HI>
has it often in a wonderful degree. Wri∣ters
endowed with the <HI>bel esprit,</HI> can
compose history and romance, and moral
and poetical essays, with the same in∣genuity.
A man of genius will only write
a history, or a romance; moral, or poe∣tical
essays; but his performances remain
with the language, while the reputation
of a <HI>bel esprit,</HI> like some artificial fires,
become suddenly extinct. And it is cu∣rious
to observe, that the very ingenious
Du Clos is denied by the French critics,
to be a man of genius, because he wrote
equally well on a variety of subjects.</P>
<P>Nor is it surprising that even a man of
genius should fail in preserving an equal
power over every province of his art; the
genius of man being necessarily limited
compared to art itself; and he who raises
admiration by his skill in one depart∣ment,
will never equal his faculty in an∣other.
<PB N="100" REF="122"/>
He who <HI>excels,</HI> like a Butler in
wit and satire, will find it impossible to
<HI>excel</HI> like a Milton, in sentiment and
imagination. The minds of men are so
many different soils; and the great art
consists in planting the trees adapted to
the soil.</P>
<P>I know no instance to shew that a great
poet <HI>excelled</HI> as a painter, or that a great
musician <HI>excelled</HI> as a statuary. But it
is not difficult to prove, that the most
eminent men of genius have found their
talent confined to their art, and even to
departments of their art.</P>
<P>The ancients therefore wisely addicted
themselves only to one species of com∣position.
The poet was not an historian,
nor the historian a poet; but the poet
was a poet, and the historian an historian.</P>
<P>I have been induced to touch on this
critical admonition, because it is some∣times
denied; and I think the error
<PB N="101" REF="123"/>
arises from not distinguishing the grand
compositions of genius, from the pretty
curiosities of the <HI>bel esprit,</HI> which may
be defined mimetic genius. Whenever
this well-known verse shall be contro∣verted,
it will be fatal to the progress of
genius,
<Q>One science only will one genius fit.
<BIBL>Pope.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>He who writes on topics of different
species, cannot meditate much on any;
with him all is a beautiful distraction
rather than an accomplished beauty; he
can only repeat what has been already
given, or give what will not merit to be
repeated. Writers of mediocrity, by a
long and patient devotion to <HI>one kind</HI> of
composition, have often attained con∣siderable
merit; but how much more
forcibly must this resolute perseverance
act on a mind of original powers. We
<PB N="102" REF="124"/>
may compare those who write on dif∣ferent
arts, or multifarious topics, to
excursive merchants, who make small
fortunes in various places, and spend
them there; writers who concentrate
their powers on one object, are like those
who incessantly accumulate, but exhaust
their splendid opulence, in the proper
place, at their native residence.</P>
<P>It is the observation of one of our best
critics and poets, in his admirable pre∣face
to Homer, that <Q REND="inline">no author or man
ever excelled all the world in more
than one faculty.</Q> It is not, however,
denied that a man of genius should be
intimate with the principles of every art;
in many he may become an esteemed
artist, but in one only he can be a
master.<Q><L>On ne vit qu'a demi quand on n'a qu'un seul gout;</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Some Observations respecting the Infirmities
and Defects of Men of Genius.</HEAD>
<P>THE modes of life of a man of genius
are often tinctured with eccentricity and
enthusiasm. These are in an eternal con∣flict
with the usages of common life. His
occupations, his amusements, and his
ardour, are discordant to daily pursuits,
and prudential habits. It is the charac∣teristic
of genius to display no talent to
ordinary men; and it is unjust to cen∣sure
the latter when they consider him
as born for no human purpose. Their
pleasures and their sorrows are not his
pleasures and his sorrows. He often ap∣pears
to slumber in dishonourable ease,
while his days are passed in labours, more
constant and more painful than those of
<PB N="104" REF="126"/>
the manufacturer. The world are not
always aware that to meditate, to com∣pose,
and even to converse with some,
are great labours; and as Hawkesworth
observes, that <Q REND="inline">weariness may be con∣tracted
in an arm chair.</Q></P>
<P>Such men are also censured for an ir∣ritability
of disposition. Many reasons
might apologize for these unhappy vari∣ations
of humour. The occupation of
making a great name, is, perhaps, more
anxious and precarious than that of
making a great fortune. We sympathise
with the merchant when he communi∣cates
melancholy to the social circle in
consequence of a bankruptcy, or when
he feels the elation of prosperity at the
success of a vast speculation. The au∣thor
is not less immersed in cares, or
agitated by success, for literature has it's
bankruptcies and it's speculations.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="127"/>
The anxieties and disappointments of
an author, even of the most successful,
are incalculable. If he is learned, learn∣ing
is the torment of unquenchable thirst,
and his elaborate work is exposed to the
accidental recollection of an inferior
mind, as well as the fatal omissions of
wearied vigilance. If he excels in the
magic of diction, and the graces of
fancy, his path is strewed with roses,
but his feet bleed on invisible yet piercing
thorns. Rousseau has given a glowing
description of the ceaseless inquietudes
by which he acquired skill in the arts of
composition; and has said, that with
whatever talent a man may be born, the
art of writing is not easily obtained. The
depressions and elevations of genius, are
described by Pope
<Q><L>Who pants for glory finds but short repose,</L>
<L>A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128"/>
The anxious uncertainty of an author
for his compositions, is like the state of
the lover who writes to his mistress; he
repents, and thinks he has written too
much, and he recollects that he had
omitted things of the greatest moment.
When, indeed, his work is received with
favour, he resembles Latona, as described
by Ovid, who contemplated with secret
joy, her daughter Diana, distinguished
among the wood-nymphs, and whosc
appearance was taller, and more lovely
than her companions.</P>
<P>It is observed by M. La Harpe (an
author by profession) that as it has been
proved there are some maladies peculiar
to artists, there are also sorrows which
are peculiar to them; and which the
world can neither pity nor soften, be∣cause
it cannot have their conceptions.
We read not without a melancholy emo∣tion,
the querulous expressions of men of
<PB N="107" REF="129"/>
genius. We have a little catalogue <HI>de
calamitate Litteratorum</HI>; we might add a
volume by the addition of most of our
own authors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The materials are ready for publication; but the hope of it's utility has past, since a <HI>Literary</HI> Fund esta∣blished in attic London found too many claimants and too few subscribers. It has died away; while the <HI>Mu∣sical</HI> Fund is patronised by the Great, which seems to prove that they have finer ears than understandings.</NOTE> The too sensible Smollet
has left this testimonial to posterity of his
feelings. In one of his prefaces he says,
<Q REND="inline">had some of those who were pleased to
call themselves my friends, been at any
pains to deserve the character, and told
me ingenuously what I had to expect
in the capacity of an <HI>Author,</HI> I should
in all probability have spared myself
the <HI>incredible labour</HI> and <HI>chagrin</HI> I have
since undergone.</Q> This is a text
which requires no commentary. Hume
has given the history of his writings, and
we find that it required to the full, all
<PB N="108" REF="130"/>
his patient philosophy to support his ill
reception. The reasoning Hume pro∣posed
changing his name and his coun∣try.
Parties are formed against a man
of genius, as happened to Corneille and
Milton; and a Pradon and a Settle are
preferred to a Racine and a Dryden.
What must have been the agonies of the
neglected Collins when he burnt his ex∣quisite
odes at the door of his publisher!
The great Bacon bequeathed his name
and his works to foreigners, and to a fu∣ture
age; nor must we forget the dig∣nified
complaints of the Rambler, with
which he awefully closes his work in ap∣pealing
to posterity.</P>
<P>The votaries of the arts and sciencies,
are called by Cicero, Heroes of Peace;
their labours, their dangers, and their
intrepidity, make them heroes; but
peace is rarely the ornament of their fe∣verish
existence.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="131"/>
It is a mortification experienced by
several men of genius, that they have
never acquired that reputation they might
have merited, by not having been en∣abled
to carry their genius to it's per∣fection.
A variety of circumstances may
hinder such a writer from occupying the
distinguished place his abilities promised.
Some authors, of the first-rate genius,
are neglected, because deficient in that
taste, which is alone attained by long
culture and an enlarged education. Piron
was a writer of as great genius, and ori∣ginal
powers, as any of the French poets;
but he has failed of securing himself a
seat among the masters of the French
Parnassus. He has himself, in some
sketches of his life, assigned the reasons
of this failure; till the age of twenty-five,
he was confined to the narrow
circle of unlettered friends; he passed
ten or twelve years afterwards at Paris in
<PB N="110" REF="132"/>
obscurity; so that he was about forty,
when by the advice of Crebillon, he es∣sayed
his powers on his fastidious the∣atre,
and though he has evinced high
genius, he has only satisfied his refined
nation by one performance.</P>
<P>Some are now only agreeable, who
might have been great writers, had their
application to study, and the modes of
their life been different. In Mr. Greaves'
lively recollections of his friend Shen∣stone,
are some judicious observations on
this subject. He has drawn a compari∣son
between the elevated abilities of Gray,
and the humble talents of Shenstone;
and he has essayed to shew, that it was
the accidental circumstances of Gray's
place of birth, education, his admittance
into some of the best circles, and his
assiduous application to science, which
gave him that superiority over the indo∣lence,
the retirement, and the inertion
<PB N="111" REF="133"/>
of a want of patronage, which made
Shenstone, as Gray familiarly said, <Q REND="inline">hop
round his walks</Q> like a bird in a string.
I must again remind the reader of an∣other
apparent paradox of Helvetius,
who says, that it is the different modes
of education which influence men so
wonderfully; and that <HI>genius</HI> may be <HI>ac∣quired</HI>
whenever a proper study is accom∣panied
by a fervent passion for any par∣ticular
art or science. This fervent pas∣sion
may be only another name for what
is called genius. I believe, however, that
Shenstone, who now occupies a subordi∣nate
seat, in the Temple of Fame, might
have been placed among the higher
classes. Perhaps most men are born
with abilities nearly equal; and Mr.
Greaves has more reason on his side than
some may be aware, when he says, <Q REND="inline">of
two persons, born to equal fortune, if
one improves his stock by industry
<PB N="112" REF="134"/>
and traffic, and the other lives idly
upon the principal, the consequence is
obvious.</Q></P>
<P>Others, by an ignorance of a fine
manner, or by a wrong direction long
pursued, waste their talents, on the hum∣bler
departments of art, when they have
sufficient genius to excel in the highest.
This is the case among many of our
provincial writers, who, with no incon∣siderable
talents, are placed often in situ∣ations
where they study authors whose
taste is surpassed by the more modern.
We often see ingenious writers, who are
about half a century removed from the
public taste. Among the painters, Al∣bert
Durer may serve as an instance.
Vasari (quoted by Sir Joshua Reynolds)
justly remarked, that he would have pro∣bably
been one of the first painters of
his age, had he been initiated into the
great principles of the art, so well un∣derstood
<PB N="113" REF="135"/>
by his Italian contemporaries.
And Sir Joshua adds, but unluckily hav∣ing
never seen or heard of any other
manner, he considered his own, with∣out
doubt, as perfect.</P>
<P>Men of genius are often reverenced
only where they are known by their wri∣tings.
In the romance of life they are
divinities, in it's history they are men.
From errors of the mind, and derelic∣tions
of the heart, they may not be ex∣empt;
these are perceived by their
acquaintance, who can often discern only
these qualities. The defects of great
men are the consolation of the dunces.</P>
<P>Degrading vices and singular follies
have dishonoured men of the highest
genius. Than others, their passions are
more effervescent, and their relish for
enjoyment more keen. Genius is a pe∣rilous
gift of Nature; for it is acknow∣ledged
that the same materials she em∣ploys
<PB N="114" REF="136"/>
to form a Cataline and a Cromwell,
make a Cicero and a Bacon. Plato, in
his visionary sketches of a man of genius,
lays great stress on his having the most
violent passions, with reason to restrain
them. Helvetius, an accurate observer
of men of genius, also enforces the idea
of their inflammable and physical passi∣ons.
Glory and infamy is the same
violent passion, but the direction is dif∣ferent,
and Voltaire has expressed this
in one verse,<Q>Si Je n'etois Cesar, j'aurois etè Brutus.</Q> Genius, like a storm of wind in Arabia,
either directs the myriads of locusts to
the land, or with a friendly influence dis∣perses
them away.</P>
<P>For their foibles it appears more dif∣ficult
to account than for their vices; for
a violent passion depends on it's direction
to become either excellence or depra∣vity;
but why their exalted mind should
<PB N="115" REF="137"/>
not preserve them from the imbecillities
of fools, appears a mere caprice of Na∣ture.
A curious list might be formed of
<Q>Fears of the brave and follies of the wise.
<BIBL>Johnson.</BIBL></Q>
In the note underneath I have thrown to∣gether
a few facts which may be passed
over by those who have no taste for
literary anecdotes.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voiture was the son of a vintner, and like our Prior, was so mortified whenever reminded of his ori∣ginal occupation, that it was said of him, that wine which cheared the heart of all men, sickened that of Voiture. Rousseau, the poet, was the son of a cobler; and when his honest parent waited at the door of the theatre, to embrace his son on the success of his first piece, the inhuman poet repulsed the venerable father with insult and contempt. Akenside ever considered his lameness as an unsupportable misfortune, since it continually reminded him of his origin, being occasi∣oned by the fall of a cleaver from one of his father's blocks, a respectable butcher. Milton delighted in contemplating his own person, and the engraver not having reached our sublime Bard's "ideal grace," he has pointed his indignation in four iambics. Among the complaints of Pope, is that of "the pictured shape." Even the strong-minded Johnson would not be painted "blinking Sam." Mr. Boswell tells us that Goldsmith attempted to shew his agility to be superior to the dancing of an ape, whose praise had occasioned him a fit of jealousy, but he failed in imitating his rival. The inscription under Boileau's portrait, describing his character with lavish panegyric, and a preference to Juvenal and Horace, is unfortu∣nately known to have been written by himself.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="138"/>
But it is also necessary to acknowledge,
that men of genius are often unjustly re∣proached
with foibles. The sports of a
vacant mind, are misunderstood as fol∣lies.
The simplicity of truth may ap∣pear
vanity, and the consciousness of
superiority, envy. Nothing is more usual
than our surprise at some great writer or
artist contemning the labours of another,
whom the public cherish with equal ap∣probation.
We place it to the account of
his envy, but perhaps this opinion is
erroneous, and claims a concise investi∣gation.</P>
<P>Every superior writer has a MANNER of
his own, with which he has long been
<PB N="117" REF="139"/>
conversant, and too often inclines to
judge of the merit of a performance by
the degree it attains of his favourite
manner. He errs, because impartial men
of taste are addicted to no manner, but
love whatever is exquisite. We often
see readers draw their degree of compa∣rative
merit from the manner of their
favourite author; an author does the
same; that is, he draws it from himself.
Such a partial standard of taste is erro∣neous;
but it is more excuseable in the
author, than in the reader.</P>
<P>This observation will serve to explain
several curious phenomena in literature.
The witty Cowley despised the natural
Chaucer; the classical Boileau, the rough
sublimity of Crebillon; the forcible Cor∣neille,
the tender Racine; the affected
Marivaux, the familiar Moliere; the ar∣tificial
Gray, the simple Shenstone. Each
alike judged by that peculiar manner
<PB N="118" REF="140"/>
he had long formed. In a free conver∣sation
they might have contemned each
other; and a dunce, who had listened
without taste or understanding, if he had
been a haberdasher in anecdotes, would
have hastened to reposit in his ware∣room
of literary falsities, a long decla∣mation
on the vanity and envy of these
great men.</P>
<P>But the charge of vanity has been
urged with great appearance of truth
against authors, for the complacence they
experience in their works, and the high
admiration of themselves. An author is
pictured as a Narcissus.</P>
<P>It has long been acknowledged that
every work of merit, the more it is ex∣amined,
the greater the merit will ap∣pear.
The most masterly touches, and
the reserved graces, which form the
pride of the artist, are not observable till
after a familiar and constant meditation.
<PB N="119" REF="141"/>
What is most refined is least obvious;
and to some must remain unperceived
for ever. Churchill, in the opening of
his second book of Gotham, justly ob∣serves,
that to form the beauties of
composition,
<Q><L>—few can do, and scarcely one,</L>
<L>One critic in an age can find when done.</L></Q></P>
<P>But ascending from these elaborate
strokes in composition, to the views and
designs of an author, the more profound
and extensive these are, the more they
elude the reader's apprehension. I re∣fine
not too much when I say, that the
author is conscious of <HI>beauties,</HI> that <HI>are
not in his composition.</HI> The happiest wri∣ters
are compelled to see some of their
most magnificent ideas float along the
immensity of mind, beyond the feeble
grasp of expression. Compare the state
of the author with that of the reader;
how copious and overflowing is the mind
<PB N="120" REF="142"/>
of the one to the other; how more sen∣sibly
alive to a variety of exquisite strokes
which the other has not yet perceived;
the author is familiar with every part,
and the reader has but a vague notion of
the whole. How many noble conceptions
of Rousseau are not yet mastered! How
many profound reflections of Montesquieu
are not yet understood! How many sub∣tile
lessons are yet in Locke, which no
preceptor can teach!</P>
<P>Such, among others, are the reasons
which may induce an author to express
himself in language which may sound
like vanity. To be admired, is the noble
simplicity of the ancients, (imitated by a
few elevated minds among the moderns)
in expressing with ardour the conscious∣ness
of genius. We are not more dis∣pleased
with Dryden than with Cicero,
when he acquaints us of the great things
he has done, and those he purposes to
<PB N="121" REF="143"/>
do. Modern modesty might, perhaps,
to some be more engaging, if it were
modesty; but our artificial blushes are
like the ladies' temporary rouge, ever
ready to colour the face on any occasion.
Some will not place their names to their
books, yet prefix it to their advertise∣ments;
others pretend to be the editors
of their own works; some compliment
themselves in the third person; and
many, concealed under the shade of ano∣nymous
criticism, form panegyrics, as
elaborate and long as Pliny's on Trajan,
of their works and themselves; yet in a
conversation, start at a compliment, and
quarrel at a quotation. Such modest au∣thors
resemble <HI>certain</HI> ladies, who in
<HI>public</HI> are equally celebrated for the
coldest chastity.</P>
<P>Consciousness of merit characterises
men of genius; but it is to be lamented
that the illusions of self-love, are not dis∣tinguishable
<PB N="122" REF="144"/>
from the realities of consci∣ousness.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following are instances. Epicurus wrote to a Minister of State, <Q REND="inline">if you desire glory, nothing can bestow it so much as the letters I write to you.</Q> Seneca, in quoting these words, adds, <Q REND="inline">what Epi∣curus promised to his friend, that my Lucilius I promise you.</Q> These were great men. But one La Serre, a French writer of epistles, when he addres∣sed them, used to say, <Q REND="inline">I immortalise you, Sir, and this merits at least your gratitude.</Q> How many La Serres might we quote!</P></NOTE>
Yet if we were to take from
some their pride of exultation, we anni∣hilate
the germ of their excellence. The
persuasion of a just posterity smoothed
the sleepless pillow, and spread a sun∣shine
in the solitude of Bacon, Montes∣quieu,
and Newton; of Cervantes, Gray,
and Milton. Men of genius anticipate
their contemporaries, and know they are
such, long before the tardy consent of
the public.</P>
<P>They have also been accused of the
meanest adulations; it is certain that
many have had the weakness to praise
<PB N="123" REF="145"/>
unworthy men, and some the courage to
erase what they have written. A young
writer unknown, yet languishing for en∣couragement,
when he first finds the
notice of a person of some eminence, has
expressed himself in language which gra∣titude,
a finer reason than reason itself,
inspired. Strongly has Milton expressed
the sensations of this passion, <Q REND="inline">the debt
immense of endless gratitude.</Q> Who
ever pays an "immense debt" in small
sums?</P>
<P>Even extravagant applauses may be
excused. Every man of genius has left
such honourable traces of his private af∣fections;
from Locke, whose dedication of
his immortal treatise is more adulative
than could be supposed from a temperate
philosopher, to Churchill, whose eulo∣gies
on his friends form so beautiful a
contrast with the acerbity of his satire.
As their susceptibility is more ardent,
<PB N="124" REF="146"/>
and their penetration keener, than other
men, it is not improbable that they often
discover traits in the characters of those
with whom they are familiar, unper∣ceived
and unknown to the world. The
most illustrious of the ancients placed the
name of some friend at the head of their
works; we too often prefix the name of
some patron; but the most graceful place
is, perhaps, in the midst of a work,
when a man of genius shows that he is
not less mindful of his social affection
than his fame.</P>

<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="125" REF="147"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Literary Friendships and Enmities.</HEAD>
<P>A DELIGHTFUL topic opens to our con∣templation.
I enter the scene, as Eneas
the green Elysium, where he viewed the
once illustrious inhabitants of the earth
reposing in social felicity. Among the
multitude, a Pythias and Damon are
rare; for friendship appears too serious
for the frivolous, and too romantic for
the busy. The mutable passions of the
frivolous oblige them to forsake those
bosoms in which they have reposited
their extinct passions; and the varying
object of the varying hour requires a new
set of associates. The busy suffer no in∣timacies
to intrude on their private
views; the mysterious magnet of friend∣ship
is attached only by invisible atoms
<PB N="126" REF="148"/>
of sympathy, but falls without cohesion,
on the solidity of gold.</P>
<P>It is honourable to Literature, that
among the virtues it inspires, is that of
ardent friendship, and it's history pre∣sents
no unfrequent instances of it's finest
enthusiasm. The delirium of love is
often too violent a passion for the student,
and it's caprices are still more incom∣patible
with his pursuits than it's deli∣rium.
But friendship is not only delight∣ful,
but necessary to soothe a mind alter∣nately
elated and depressed; when infirm,
it strengthens, when dubious, it en∣lightens,
when discouraged, it animates.</P>
<P>That however it should be rare in
literature, will excite no surprise. The
qualities necessary to constitute literary
friendship, compared with those of men
of the world, must render it's occasional
appearance a singularity. Literary friend∣ship
has no convivial gaieties or factious
<PB N="127" REF="149"/>
assemblies. Two atoms must meet, out
of the vast mass of nature, of so equal a
form that when they once adhere, they
shall appear as one, and resist the utmost
force of separation. Their studies must
be similar, and yet so far from becoming
rivals, each must find reciprocal assis∣tance;
when one of them is at length
found to excel, the other is to be the
protector of his fame. Each must live
for the other, decide with one judgment,
and feel with one taste. In this inter∣course
of minds, the private passions are
not to be gratified, but often to be cor∣rected,
and an energetic passion for study
must alone be indulged. In their fami∣liar
conversations, learning is commu∣nicated
without study, and wit without
art. What is given by one is improved
by the other; fancy is enriched by me∣mory:
and to such conversations the
world is indebted for many of it's hap∣piest
<PB N="128" REF="150"/>
productions. The greatest incon∣venience
attending such a friendship, is
to survive the friend; nor are there
wanting instances in which this has not
been suffered, and the violence of grief
has operated like a voluntary death.</P>
<P>The friendships of men of the world
are different both in their features and
their complections. There we find with
facility, men of analogous dispositions;
but such intimacies terminate in com∣plaint
and contempt. A feeble mind
acquires still more imbecillity with the
feeble; a dissolute heart riots in guilt
with the dissolute; and while we despise
our companion, we in return have be∣come
despicable.</P>
<P>Among the most pleasing effusions of
a man of genius, are those little pieces
which he consecrates to the cause of
friendship; and among his noblest ac∣tions,
are those fervid and spontaneous
<PB N="129" REF="151"/>
testimonies of affection, of which literary
history affords many examples. I shall
have no recourse to the abundant in∣stances
which the ancients have left; the
moderns may be instructed by the mo∣derns.
To notice a few will be sufficient,
and not to notice them, would be re∣fusing
the young reader no ordinary
gratification. Such is the memorable
friendship of Beaumont and Fletcher,
that as they have so closely united their
labours that we know not the productions
of either; it is with equal difficulty bio∣graphers
compose the memoirs of one,
without running into the life of the other.
They pourtrayed the same characters,
while they mingled sentiment with sen∣timent,
and their days were not more
closely interwoven than their verses. The
poem of Cowley, on the death of his
friend Harvey, is not, indeed, free from
some of his remote conceits; yet the fol∣lowing
<PB N="130" REF="152"/>
stanza presents a pleasing picture
of the employments of two young
students.<Q><L>Say, for you saw us ye immortal lights,</L>
<L>How oft unwearied have we spent the nights▪</L>
<L>Till the Ledaean stars, so famed for love,</L>
<L>Wond'red at us from above.</L>
<L>We spent them not in toys, in lust, or wine;</L>
<L>But search of deep philosophy,</L>
<L>Wit, eloquence, and poetry,</L>
<L>Arts which I loved, for they, my friend, were thine.</L></Q></P>
<P>Milton has not only given the exquisite
Lycidas to the memory of a young
friend, but in his <HI>Epitaphium Damonis,</HI>
to that of Deodatus, has poured forth
some interesting sentiments. It has been
versified by Langhorne. Now, says the
poet,<Q><L>To whom shall I my hopes and fears impart,</L>
<L>Or trust the cares and follies of my heart.</L></Q> The elegy of Tickel, maliciously called
by Steele, "prose in rhime," is alike
inspired by affection and fancy; it has a
<PB N="131" REF="153"/>
melodious languor, and a melancholy
grace. The sonnet of Gray, to the me∣mory
of West, is a beautiful effusion, and
a model for English sonnets. Helvetius
was the protector of men of genius,
whom he assisted not only with his cri∣ticism,
but his fortune. At his death,
M. Surin read in the French academy,
an epistle to the manes of his friend.
Saurin, wrestling with obscurity and po∣verty,
was drawn into literary existence
by the supporting hand of Helvetius.
Our poet thus addresses him in the warm
tones of gratitude.<Q><L>C'est toi qui me cherchant au sein de l'infortune</L>
<L>Relevas mon sort abattu,</L>
<L>Et scus me rendre chere, une vie importune.</L><L>* * *</L>


<L>Que 'importent ces pleurs—</L>
<L>O douleur impuissante! O regrets superflus!</L>
<L>Je vis, helas! Je vis, et mon ami n'est plus!</L>

<LG>
<HEAD>IMITATED.</HEAD>
<L>Thy friend, in Misery's haunts, thy bounties sieze,</L>
<L>And give an urgent life, some days of ease;</L>
<L>Ah! ye vain griefs, superfluous tears I chide!</L>
<L>I live, alas! I live, and thou hast died!</L>
</LG></Q> <PB N="132" REF="154"/>
The literary friendship of a father with
his son, is one of the most rare alliances
in the republic of letters. We have had
a remarkable instance in the two Richard∣sons;
and the father, in his fine original
and warm manner, has employed the
most glowing language to express his
sentiments on this affection. He says,
<Q REND="inline">my time of learning was employed in
business; but after all I have the
Greek and Latin tongues, because a
part of me possesses them, to whom I
can recur at pleasure, just as I have a
hand when I would write or paint, feet
to walk, and eyes to see. My son is my
learning, as I am that to him which he
has not; we make one man, and such
a compound man may probably pro∣duce
what no single man can.</Q> And
further, <Q REND="inline">I always think it my peculiar
happiness to be as it were enlarged, ex∣panded,
made another man by the
<PB N="133" REF="155"/>
acquisition of my son, and he thinks
in the same manner concerning my
union with him.</Q> All this is as cu∣rious
as it is uncommon.</P>
<P>But it must not be supposed that men
of genius have remained satisfied with
only giving a few verses to the duties of
friendship. The elevation of their minds
has raised them into domestic heroes,
whose actions are often only recorded in
the unpublished register of private life.
Some for their friend have died, pene∣trated
with inconsolable grief; some
have sacrificed their character to his own;
some have shared their limited fortune;
and some have remained attached to
their friend in the worst season of ad∣versity.
In the note underneath I adduce
my proofs of what is so honourable to
literature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jurieu denounced Bayle as an impious writer, and drew his testimonies from the "Avis aux Refugies." This work is written against Calvinists, and therefore becomes impious in Holland. Bayle might have ex∣culpated himself with facility, by declaring the work was composed by La Roque; but he preferred to be persecuted, rather than to ruin his friend; he there∣fore was silent, and condemned.—When the minister Fouquet was abandoned by all, it was the men of let∣ters he had patronised, who never forsook his prison; and many have dedicated their works to great men in their adversity, whom they scorned to notice, at the time when they were noticed by all.—The learned Goguet bequeathed his MSS. and library to his friend Fugere, with whom he had united his affections and his studies. His work on the Origin of the Arts and Sciences, had been much indebted to his aid. In vain was the legacy bequeathed; Goguet died of a slow and painful disorder; Fugere, who knew him to be past recovery, preserved a mute despair, retired home, and the victim of sensibility and friendship died, a few weeks after his friend.—The Abbè de Saint Pierre gave an interesting proof of literary friendship. When he was at College, he formed a union with Varignon, the geometrician. They were of congenial disposi∣tions; when he went to Paris, he invited Varignon to accompany him; but Varignon had nothing, and the Abbè was far from rich. A certain income was ne∣cessary for the tranquil pursuits of geometry. Our Abbè had an income of 1800 livres; from this he de∣ducted 300, which he gave to the geometrician, but accompanied by a delicacy which none but a man of genius could conceive. I do not give it you (he said) as a salary, but an annuity, that you may be inde∣pendent, and quit, when you dislike me. Something nearly similar embellishes our own scanty literary his∣tory. When Akenside was in great danger of experiencing famine as well as fame, Mr. Dyson al∣lowed him three hundred pounds a year. Of this gentleman, perhaps, nothing is known; yet whatever his life may be, it merits the tribute of the biographer; this single action will cast a lustre round the meanest objects. The <HI>race</HI> of the Dysons are, no doubt, long extinct; it would be rash for another Akenside to look round for another Dyson. To close with these honourable testimonies of literary friendship, we must not omit that of Churchill and Lloyd. It is known that when Lloyd heard of the death of our poet, he acted the port which Fugere did to Goguet. I conclude by remarking that the page is crouded, but my memory is by no means exhausted.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="156"/>
I shall be concise on the subject of their
enmities; for what could even ingenuity
<PB N="135" REF="157"/>
urge to distinguish literary calumny
from any other kind? The reflection
should humiliate men of genius, that
when they condescend to asperse with
rage and malignity, another artist, they
are only doing what the worst part of so∣ciety
can perform, as well as themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="158"/>
But reason trembles when wit is
united with malice, and malice with wan∣tonness.
Churchill says,
<Q>When Reason's for me, God is for me too.</Q>
But how rarely are satirists conducted by
reason! Our laws offer no protection from
a bitter epigram, and an artful satire.
Irony is not denominated by an attorney
a libel; by an honest man it may be felt
as something much worse. Fortune has
been lost, reputation destroyed, and every
charity of life been extinguished by witty
malice. To debase a man in the circle
of his acquaintance, if unfortunately his
sensibility is exquisite, has not infre∣quently
been committing a less crime
than murder. The Abbè Cassagne felt
so acutely the caustic verse of Boileau,
that, in the prime of life, he became
melancholy, and died insane. A modern
painter fell the victim of the criticism
<PB N="137" REF="159"/>
and the wit of a satirist, who shall be
nameless on this occasion. Dr. Johnson
related of Cummyns, a celebrated quaker,
that he confessed he died of an anony∣mous
letter in a public paper, which
said, he <Q REND="inline">fastened on my heart, and
threw me into this slow fever.</Q> Some,
like Racine, have died of a simple re∣buke;
and some by an epigram as well
as a satire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. The Characters of Writers not discoverable
in their Writings.</HEAD>
<P>IT has long been a cherished notion
among men of taste, that the dispositions
of an artist appear in his works; and the
sublime Angelo, and the graceful Ra∣phael,
are produced as splendid instances.
It has also been a very ancient opinion,
that the character of an author is dis∣coverable
in his writings. The echo from
biographers has been constant, and often
they pourtray the man, by the mirror of
his works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Ruffhead, in his dull book on Pope, says, (p. 8.) <Q REND="inline">To an accurate observer, the temper and morals of a writer breathe throughout his works.</Q> What has been the consequence of this false and popular opi∣nion? He has written a great deal about Pope and Poetry, and, as Johnson said, he knew as little of one as the other.</P></NOTE> The anecdote which Dr.
<PB N="139" REF="161"/>
Johnson has given of Thomson, has
served at least to suspect it's fallibility.
The subject, however, demands investi∣gation,
and perhaps may be finally ter∣minated
by the facts I now adduce.</P>
<P>We enquire whether he is a moral
man who composes moral essays; incon∣tinent,
who writes lascivious poems;
malignant, who publishes bitter satires;
and savage, whose imagination delights
in terror and in blood.</P>
<P>It is one characteristic of genius to say
things for their ingenuity, and to display
the felicity of fancy, than from any utility
which may be drawn from them. Of
many obscene poets, the greater part
have led chaste lives; and this topic has
engaged the acute examination of Bayle.
La Mothe le Váier wrote two works of a
free nature; yet his life was the unble∣mished
life of a retired sage. Of many of
the ancient poets, it appears that the li∣centiousness
<PB N="140" REF="162"/>
of their verse, was by no
means communicated to their manners.
Their page was lascivious, and their life
pure, for the fancy may be debauched,
and the heart austere.</P>
<P>The licentious tales of La Fontaine
are well known, but not a single amour
has been recorded of the "bon homme."
Bayle is a remarkable instance; no writer
is more ample in his detail of impurity,
but he resisted the pollution of the senses
as much as Newton. He painted his
scenes of lewdness merely as a faithful
historian, and an exact compiler. Smol∣let's
character is immaculate, yet what a
description has he given of one of his
heroes with Lord Straddle. I cannot
but observe on such scenes, that their
delineation answers no good purpose.
Modesty cannot read, and is morality
interested? He assumed the character
of Petronius Arbiter; we applaud and
<PB N="141" REF="163"/>
we censure this mere playfulness of fancy.
It is certain, however, by these instances,
that licentious writers may be very
chaste men.</P>
<P>We now turn to those works which, by
their cast, promise that the authors were
pious and moral men. Two celebrated
ancients must not be passed over in this
enumeration, Seneca and Sallust. The
first is an admirable stoic, elaborate in
his delineation of the moral duties; but
his essays on the advantages of poverty,
were written on a table of gold, and his
admonitions of supporting pain, on vo∣luptuous
sophas, and in fragrant baths.
This moral declaimer ruined my county.
Essex, by the most exorbitant usuries,
and inculcated the comforts of poverty
with a fortune of seven millions. Sallust
elegantly declaims against the licentious
manners of his age, but we happen to
know that he was repeatedly accused in
<PB N="142" REF="164"/>
the senate for public and habitual de∣baucheries.
He inveighs against the
spoilers of countries, yet, when he at∣tained
to a remote government, he be∣came
a Verres. Lucian, in his early
productions, declaims against the friend∣ships
of the great, as another name for
servitude; when his talents made him
known, he accepted a place under the
Emperor. He has attempted to apolo∣gize
for his conduct, by comparing him∣self
to those quacks, who, indisposed
with a severe cough, sell infallible reme∣dies
for it's cure. At the moment the
poet Rousseau was giving versions of the
psalms, he was occupied on the most in∣famous
epigrams. A living painter,
whose pictures only represent acts of be∣nevolence
and charity, is as little generous
as he is chaste.</P>
<P>We have been told that the sensibility
of Sterne was more that of the author
<PB N="143" REF="165"/>
than the man; perhaps those who gave
the information were incompetent jud∣ges;
but I do not find this any more
difficult to credit, than a circumstance
which happened to Klopstock. This
votary of Zion's muse astonished and
warmed the sage Bodmer, who supposing
him a poet of an advanced age, and an
enthusiast for retirement, invited him to
his residence; but when the epic poet
arrived, he was found no proper associate
for the grave professor; he had all the
levity and volatility of youth. So very
erroneous is the conception often of the
form and manners of a distant author.</P>
<P>Johnson would not believe that Horace
was a happy man, because his verses
were chearful; no more than he could
think Pope was so, because he is con∣tinually
informing us of it. He observed
that Dr. Young, who pined for prefer∣ment,
contemns it in his writings. It
<PB N="144" REF="166"/>
is singular that the sombrous author of
the night thoughts, was the first to
propose a subscription for the balls at
Wellwyn.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This anecdote is from Mr. Pye's commentary on the poetic of Aristotle. This work has great claims on the attention of the critical reader. It is not as it's title would seem to import, an arid pedantic and me∣taphysical discussion, but elegant, amusing, and useful criticism.</NOTE> Young was as chearful in
conversation as he was gloomy in his
compositions, and when a lady expressed
her surprise at his social converse, he
replied, <Q REND="inline">there is much difference be∣tween
writing and talking.</Q> Are we
to credit the good fortune with which
some poets so often felicitate themselves,
any more than their despondence and
menaces? Thomson paints the scenes of
domestic love with all the splendid de∣corations
of fancy, but knew nothing of
it's reality but a casual and gross in∣dulgence.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="167"/>
Inconstant men will write on constancy,
and licentious minds will elevate them∣selves
into poetry and religion. Moral
men will venture to write what they
would not act, while others of inferior
honesty will act what they will not ven∣ture
to write.</P>
<P>To prove that the writings of an au∣thor
give no indication of his personal
character, we have instances so multifa∣rious,
that to bring them forward might
weary the most patient curiosity. I con∣sult
my interest, by repressing the desire
of displaying my detections.</P>
<P>It is necessary, however, to adduce
a few, that the reader may not flatter
himself that he has discovered the dis∣positions
of an author, either by his style,
his mode of thinking, or any other lite∣rary
appearance he may assume. Balzac
and Voiture are so well known, that I
prefer them to shew the illusions of style.
<PB N="146" REF="168"/>
The letters of the first are pompous and
inflated; but his conversation was light
and agreeable. Voiture, who affected
gaiety and gracefulness in his compo∣sitions,
was in his domestic language,
harsh and stiff, for having frequented the
nobility, he ever assumed the Seigneur.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The comedies of M. de St. Foix are light, agree∣able, and delicate; his own character was remarkable for moroseness, rudeness, and insociability. Moliere, so gay and spirited in his comedy, was grave and pen∣sive in society.</NOTE>
Writers of great genius have felt them∣selves
in awkward situations, when the
extraordinary sentiments they make
their dramatis personae utter, are malici∣ously
applied to their own character. An
enemy of Shakespeare, might have re∣proached
him with his forcible deline∣ation
of the villain Iago. Crebillon,
indeed, complains in the preface to one
of his tragedies, of something similar.
He says, <Q REND="inline">they charge me with all the
<PB N="147" REF="169"/>
iniquities of Atreus; and they regard
me, in some places, as a wretch with
whom it is unfit to associate; as if all
which the mind invents, must be de∣rived
from the heart.</Q> Our poet is,
indeed, a striking instance of the little
alliance between the literary and personal
dispositions of an author. In his Atreus,
the father drinks the blood of his son;
in Rhadamistus, the son expires by the
hand of the father; and in his Electra,
the son assassinates his mother; yet was
Crebillon the gentlest and most amiable
of men, and who exulted on his entrance
into the French academy, that he had
never tinged his pen with the gall of
satire. The impiety of Satan, might
equally be attributed to the poet; and
Dr. Moore might be supposed the worst
of men, by his forcible delineation of
Zeluco. A poet is a painter of the soul;
if he seizes it's deformities, he is a great
artist, but not therefore a bad man.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="170"/>
I spare the reader a number of in∣stances
that croud on the memory, and
shall give only a few reflections which
offer themselves. One may display with
artful elegance, the moral brilliancy of
the mind, and with strokes of sentiment,
interest the heart by an animated elo∣quence.
But this may proceed from a
felicity of manner, and a flexible, versa∣tile,
and happy genius. The writer's
heart may be as little penetrated by the
charms and virtues he describes, as the
tragic poet would be incapable of com∣mitting
the assassinations and massacres
he commands in a verse, or details in a
scene.</P>
<P>Montagne appears to have been sen∣sible
of this fact in the literary character.
Of authors, he says, that he likes to read
their little anecdotes and private passions,
and adds, <Q REND="inline">Car j'ai une singuliére cu∣riositè
de connoitrE l'ame et les naifs
<PB N="149" REF="171"/>
jugemens de mes auteurs. Il faut bien
juger leur suffisance, mais non pas leurs
moeurs, ni eux, par cette montre de
leurs ecrits qu'ils etalent au theatre du
monde.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline">For I have a singular curiosity to know the soul, and simple opinions of my authors. We must judge of their ability, but not of their manners, nor them∣selves, by that shew of their writings which they dis∣play on the theatre of the world.</Q></P></NOTE></Q> This is very just; and I am
not yet persuaded that the simplicity of
this old and admirable favourite of Eu∣rope
might not have been a theatrical
gesture, as much as the sensibility of
Sterne.</P>
<P>I conclude by observing, that if we
consider that he who paints vice with
energy is therefore vicious, we may in∣jure
an honest man; and if we imagine
that he who celebrates virtue is therefore
virtuous, we may happen to deceive our∣selves
in reposing on a polluted heart.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of some private Advantages which induce
Men of Letters to become Authors.</HEAD>
<P>SOME private interest enters into his
view who assumes the profession of an
author. Such a motive fortunately ex∣ists;
for no reasoning man would volun∣tarily
place himself in a situation, fraught
with burning anxieties, and with sick∣ening
disgusts; with hope mingling with
despondence; with felicity so variable,
that the utmost happiness of an author is
as transient and rare, as those fine Italian
skies we sometimes see in our unsettled
climate.</P>
<P>Many are the motives which induce
to become authors; their motives, like
their misfortunes, are peculiar to them∣selves;
but the utility they produce ap∣pertains
to the public.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="173"/>
Some enter the perilous and brilliant
career of letters, as the only means of
distinguishing their abilities, and meriting
public esteem. To any other pursuit,
their situation, or their dispositions, may
be incompatible. The restless activity
of genius torments their repose; and
they feel like a young Columbus, con∣fined
to a petty port. These are men to
whom glory becomes a kind of aliment,
deprived of which, their passions, like a
concealed fire, would secretly consume
the frail machine of humanity. For
such, it is as impossible to remain silent,
as it is for some to be eloquent. They
give a voice to their feelings in their
works.</P>
<P>Others become authors, as the only
relief they find from the taedium of life.
Helvetius has maintained the singular
paradox, that <HI>Ennui</HI> produced many of
our superior writers. Several authors have
<PB N="152" REF="174"/>
invented their works, as so many schemes
to escape from the pressure of life.
It was an assertion drawn, perhaps, from
his own feelings. A financier, luxuria∣ting
in splendid opulence, courted by
each seductive form of voluptuousness,
already acknowledged as an elegant wri∣ter
and a liberal Mecenas, could only
have been induced by this motive to
encounter the close meditation, the la∣borious
arrangement, and the elaborate
elegance of a work which he resolved
should be posthumous. It is to <HI>Ennui</HI>
we owe that numerous race of opulent
scribblers, who after reiterated ill suc∣cess,
still pour their plenteous volumes
on a wearied and incurious public. Ma∣rolles
persisted to the last in his uninter∣rupted
amusement of printing books,
and his readers having long ceased, he
was compelled to present them to his
friends, who, however, were not his
<PB N="153" REF="175"/>
readers. There are many writers who
pass their days in amazing labours, and
are veterans without being known as vo∣lunteers.
Of some, a private press is
the literary horizon; composition pre∣serves
their mind from what a French
writer pleasantly calls "the horrors of
digestion." It is well if they would
only take their physic in private. These
are the Shakespeares whose plays have
been refused, and the Addisons whose
spectators have never been read.</P>
<P>Others follow the avocations of an au∣thor
as a means of subsisting on the
produce of virtuous talents; their mo∣derate
and precarious existence is more
honourable than a ducal revenue, and
more precious than a contractor's loan.
When we know that such a writer has
never violated the dignity of human na∣ture,
but has rigidly reverenced virtue,
and an elevation of soul has taught him
<PB N="154" REF="176"/>
to repel the insulting familiarity of the
great, his works receive a new and ac∣cidental
value. We pursue our medi∣tations
with confidence, and we dwell on
those fervid strokes which are the natural
expressions of a great genius, wrestling
with a heavy and oppressive fortune.</P>
<P>Literature is, indeed, the only refuge
for genius, placed in obscure situations.
It is an avenue to glory, open for those
ingenious men, who, deprived of ho∣nours
or of wealth, may by their medi∣tations,
sometimes obtain both; or if
they do not obtain either, may be ren∣dered
superior to them. To many young
writers the idea may be consolatory and
animating, that the greater part of our
first authors have ennobled themselves,
and owed nothing to their parents. The
great Grecian orator, was the son of a
sinith; the prince of Latin poets, of a
potter; the finest satirist and ode writer
<PB N="155" REF="177"/>
of antiquity, of a franchised man; the
brilliant Flechier, of a tallow chandler;
the eloquent Massillon, of a tanner; and
the philosophers Rousseau and Diderot,
of a watch-maker and a cutler; in Eng∣land,
the most nervous of moral essayists,
was the son of one who kept a book stall;
the author of the Pleasures of Imagina∣tion,
was the son of a butcher; and the
greater author of the American Revolu∣tion,
of a tallow chandler.</P>
<P>Genius has the prerogative of raising
the inferior ranks of men to the higher
classes of society. This once obtained,
the age is just; and the higher classes
become inferior.</P>
<P>We must not pass over in silence, ad∣vantages
better known, attending the
occupations of literary men. Those de∣rived
from studious habits, would be suf∣ficient
to attach the elegant mind to
literature, if reason had much power
<PB N="156" REF="178"/>
over the passions; the attraction is irre∣sistible,
when reason itself becomes a
passion.</P>
<P>The pleasures of literature have long
been a favourite amplification of elo∣quence;
and I quote not the admirable
reflections or of Cicero, or of Pliny, fa∣miliar
to every man of taste. He who
consecrates himself to letters, escapes
from the restless desires of the multitude.
The mephitic air of vulgar passions can∣not
reach him; as, we are informed of
the pernicious vapour of the lake of the
dogs in Italy, that if a person does not
bend downwards, it cannot affect him.
Is he opulent? he has sufficient firmness
to remain enamoured of literary labour.
Is he poor? he has sufficient intrepidity
to become illustrious. The first effect of
a love of letters communicates virtue and
independence; for he has silenced many
<PB N="157" REF="179"/>
private passions, and inhabits the inte∣rior,
not the superficies of his soul.</P>
<P>It is a curious observation of one
Martinelli, an Italian, who, to prove
that Study softens the manners, says, that
rarely men of letters are assassins in Italy,
duellists in France, or suicides in Eng∣land.
It is true we want not the opinion
of Martinelli, because it has been ele∣gantly
said by Horace, repeated by the
thinking Hume, and is to be found
in every book of rhetoric, in the first
chapter.</P>
<P>Literature is the only consolation in
those terrible afflictions, when we are re∣duced
by the privation of a sense, to take
our last refuge under the domestic roof.
Blindness itself is no impediment to ge∣nius;
fatal to all, it is an advantage to
an active imagination. It's powers collect
more forcibly and burn more intensely.
It is possible to form a catalogue of men
<PB N="158" REF="180"/>
of learning who have projected and
finished considerable works in this situ∣ation.
Often, too, has the gate of the
prison been the porch of fame, and a
slight indisposition conferred immorta∣lity.
A man of letters can never be said
to be exiled or imprisoned.</P>
<P>It is even to be supposed, against the
popular opinion, that study is friendly to
the constitution. A life of letters is calm
and uniform, and cherishes the mild af∣fections.
An author, if he feels not too
sensibly an occasional disappointment,
and can forgive the malice of an enemy,
finds his studies produce a happy influ∣ence
over his health. Hourly acquisi∣tions
bring new delights, and thought
from thought is pursued with tranquil∣lity;
and delight and tranquillity are
medicines to the soul, and promoters of
health. Every production of taste re∣spires
a softening balm, which sweetens
<PB N="159" REF="181"/>
that continuity of attention only expe∣rienced
by men of study. If an anatomist
could describe accurately the sensations
of a man of taste, and explain this pla∣cable
and harmonious play of the nerves,
no state of existence might, perhaps, be
found more friendly to the human frame.
Every one in the habits of study has per∣ceived
the influence of the mind over the
body; and Addison has noticed the
pleasures of the imagination as conducive
to health.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On this subject the following anecdote is curious. Alphonso of Arragon, was a prince passionately en∣amoured of literature. When he lay much indisposed, and could find no relief from his physicians, his cour∣tiers brought whatever presents they imagined might amuse him; Panormita judged proper to present him with books, among which was a Quintus Curtius, which appears to have had a wonderful effect over the studious Alphonso. He heard with such delight, the History of Alexander the Great, that after the first day he felt himself relieved, and before the conclusion of the work, astonished his physicians, by a perfect recovery. He ever afterwards contemned the doctors and their Hippocrates and Avicenna, and said he re∣quired no other medicine while he possessed Quintus Curtius. <HI>Valeant Hippocrates, Avicena, et Medici caeteri, Vivat Curtius sospitator meus.</HI></P></NOTE> The greater number of emi∣nent
writers have attained to an advanced
age. In an essay by Dr. Rushworth, a
number of ages of great students are col∣lected,
and his opinion is confirmed by
sufficient testimonies. Bayle still pro∣ceeds
<PB N="160" REF="182"/>
further, by saying, that study is
not hurtful to the constitution even in
early youth. Shenstone has, however,
echoed in one of his elegies, the vulgar
opinion,<Q>But soon the paths of health and and fame divide.</Q> If by the path of fame, our amiable wri∣ter
meant study, his ill health was never
occasioned by profound learning.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, will not deem as one
of the inferior advantages of an author,
that of his admission among the higher
circles. If in the present age, no writer
<PB N="161" REF="183"/>
can reasonably hope that his studies will
open the golden gate of preferment, or
of fortune, he may at least, when he at∣tains
to eminence, be certain of receiving
the tribute which opulent vanity pays to
his talents. But an author is little in∣debted
to such notice; the attentions of
a brilliant circle are ill-timed; it is, per∣haps,
twenty years too late. It is also
to be observed, that few men of taste can
accustom themselves to the refinements
of opulent grandeur, without creating
artificial wants, which they can never
gratify; and their future life may feel
the irritation of pleasures not to be pur∣chased,
and elegance not to be found.
To such may often be applied the ex∣clamation
of Milton's Adam, when obli∣ged
to exile himself from paradise—
<Q><L>—How shall I breathe in other air</L>
<L>Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?</L></Q>
The society of the great is little flatter∣ing;
<PB N="162" REF="184"/>
for it requires a painful vigilance to
preserve dignity with such associates.
D'Alembert has written an admired essay
on the connection between literary men,
and these men. A man of letters who
had the misfortune of living with a lord,
finely said of him, <Q REND="inline">he would familiarise
himself with me; but I repel him re∣spectfully.</Q>
An anecdote related of
Piron is not less interesting. This man
of genius had formed the most elevated
notion of the dignity of a man of letters;
nor would suffer the literary character to
be lowered in his presence. Entering the
apartment of a nobleman, who was con∣ducting
another peer to the stairs, the
noble stopped to make way for Piron,
pass on, my lord, said the noble master,
pass, he is only a poet.—Piron replied,
<Q REND="inline">since our qualities are declared, I shall
take my rank,</Q> and he placed himself
before the lord.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="185"/>
If the voice of an individual can weigh
with an author, it is when it speaks in a
foreign accent. The enquiry of an in∣telligent
foreigner sounds like the distant
plaudit of posterity. Fontenelle was never
more gratified than when a Swede, ar∣riving
at the gates of Paris, enquired of
the officers of the customs where Fon∣tenelle
resided, and expressed his indig∣nation
that none of them should have
ever heard of his name.</P>
<P>There are some hours in the life of a
man of genius, which, it may be sup∣posed,
communicate an exquisite sensa∣tion
to his feelings. It is when he
perceives the world spontaneously pay
their tribute of respect to his abilities.
It is said of Corneille, that he had his
particular seat in the theatre, and that
when he entered, the audience rose to
salute him. We know what excess of
honours was paid (the expression will be
<PB N="164" REF="186"/>
pardoned by men of taste) to the match∣less
Voltaire. Spinosa, while he gained
a humble livelihood by grinding glasses
at an obscure village in Holland, was
visited by the first general in Europe,
who, for this conference, suspended the
march of his army, and traversed a dis∣tant
province. Rousseau attracted a croud
as he passed the streets; and the people
followed him with tears of affection, as
the apostles of genius and humanity.
Lavater, receives daily the tribute of pos∣terity
in the personal admiration of every
traveller of sensibility and taste. Such
are the voluntary honours of the human
heart; honours which no monarch can
receive, unless he is that singular mo∣narch—
a man of letters on the throne.</P>
<P>I observe that this chapter on the ad∣vantages
of men of genius, is short, and
that it was with much trouble I could
even give it this amplification.</P>

<PB N="165" REF="187"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of the Utility of Authors to Individuals.</HEAD>
<P>WE have reason to believe, that
wherever authors are virtuous and free,
their nation partakes most of virtue and
of freedom; as on the contrary, where
they are dissolute and enslaved, their
nation have as little morals as liberty.
We want a dissertation on the influence
of manners on taste, and of taste on
manners. Sir Joshua Reynolds, in one
of his discourses, observes, that <Q REND="inline">in the
ornaments of the arts we find the cha∣racteristical
mark of a national taste,
as by throwing up a feather, we know
which way the wind blows, better than
by a more heavy matter.</Q></P>
<P>The morals of a nation are oftener di∣rected
by authors, than by those modern
apostles who possess vast incomes, and
<PB N="166" REF="188"/>
stolen sermons. Authors are the preach∣ers
of morality, and the arbiters of man∣ners.
They perform the office of the
<HI>Censor Morum</HI>; and if they do not al∣ways
live like the Catos of their age,
their works may effect the same benefi∣cial
influence; for, like the language of
Cato, they are so many reprimands for
folly, and remonstrances for vice.</P>
<P>An author sometimes appears, who
gives a new direction to the national cha∣racter.
In mechanics, no impulsion,
from a single hand, can communicate to
a body the force of eternal movement.
In morals it is different; for there an in∣dividual
power can for ever endow with
action the TRUTH it impels. These are
the few authors who form revolutions,
not, perhaps, in the sublime sciences,
which are reserved for the contemplation
of a few, but in that happier knowledge
which is of daily use, and addressed to
<PB N="167" REF="189"/>
those who most want instruction. These
authors are not a Newton and a Locke;
but an Addison and a Fontenelle. These
two eminent writers shall illustrate this
reflection. The Spectators introduced
literature and morals in the nation; the
young, the gay, and the fair, who flew
from the terrific form of a folio, were at∣tracted
by the light graces of a fugitive
page. Since that happy moment the dif∣fusion
of taste, and the curiosity of know∣ledge,
have produced readers who are
now enabled to discern the shades of ele∣gance;
to appreciate compositions of
genius; and to adjust the merits of in∣genious
competitors by the scale of phi∣losophical
taste. We have become a
reading, and of course a critical nation.
A refined writer is now certain of finding
readers who can comprehend him. Of
all our great men, whatever department
they have illustrated, who has left to the
<PB N="168" REF="190"/>
nation a more valuable inheritance than
Addison? Thousands hear the name of
Marlborough, but the battle of Blenheim
leaves no impression. The name of Ad∣dison
excites affection; and his Spectators
remind the modest reader where he first
gained instruction, and the great writer
where he first felt the influence of taste,
and where he still learns the art of com∣position.</P>
<P>Fontenelle operated the same kind of
revolution in France. Before his bril∣liant
wit and exact science were united,
learning was the solitary enjoyment of
the learned. Astronomy and erudition
were reserved for the astronomer and the
erudit. Each spoke his own language;
Fontenelle was their interpreter. He
explained vast totalities by gradual de∣ductions,
and sublime conceptions, by
familiar ideas. The lady at her toilette
described the motions of a heavenly body,
<PB N="169" REF="191"/>
while she was regulating her own; and
the beau monde had a finer penetration
into the nature of oracles, than the
pedant Van Dale, who had written so co∣piously,
and whom no one could read.</P>
<P>These are the valued authors who de∣light
and soothe their fellow-citizens;
the benefactors of every man. A mind
happily disposed imbibes their felicity of
character. We read, among the Persian
fables of Sadi, of a swimmer, who, hav∣ing
found a piece of common earth, was
astonished at it's fragrance, and enquired
if it were musk or amber? <Q REND="inline">No,</Q> re∣plied
the perfumed mould, <Q REND="inline">I am no∣thing
but common earth; but roses
were planted on my soil, and their
odorous virtues have deliciously pene∣trated
through all my pores. I have
retained the infusion of sweetness; I
had otherwise been but common
earth.</Q>—Sadi ingeniously applies this
<PB N="170" REF="192"/>
poetical incident to the effect his mistress
produces over him. We may also apply
it to an essay of Addison, or a dialogue
of Fontenelle, which, like the roses on
the common earth, impregnate with in∣tellectual
sweetness an uncultivated mind.</P>
<P>Those who feel with enthusiasm the
eloquence of a fine writer, insensibly re∣ceive
some particles from it; a virtuous
writer communicates virtue; a refined
writer, a subtile delicacy; a sublime
writer, an elevation of sentiment. All
these characters of the mind, in a few
years, are diffused throughout the nation.
Among us, what acute reasoners has the
refined penetration of Hume formed;
what amenity of manners has not Addison
introduced; to how many virtuous youths
have not the moral essays of Johnson im∣parted
fortitude, and illumined with re∣flection?</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="193"/>
It is presumed, that while they thus
powerfully operate on the <HI>minds</HI> of their
<HI>readers,</HI> their <HI>own minds,</HI> in the practice
of their studies, are influenced in a simi∣lar
manner. One of the most pleasing
passages in the platonic Shaftesbury, is
to this purpose; and though we have al∣ready
proved it, not exactly conformable
to facts, it is not entirely a brilliant re∣verie.
Our noble author, comparing the
writer with the sculptor and the painter,
says, that <Q REND="inline">there is this essential differ∣ence
between the artists of each kind;
that they who design merely after
<HI>bodies,</HI> and form the graces of this sort,
can never, with all their accuracy, or
correctness of design, be able to reform
themselves, or grow a jot more shapely
in their persons. But for those artists,
who copy from another life, who study
the graces and perfections of <HI>minds,</HI>
and are real masters of those rules which
<PB N="172" REF="194"/>
constitute this latter science, 'tis impos∣sible
they should fail of being them∣selves
<HI>improved</HI> and <HI>amended</HI> in their
better part.</Q> That delightful enthu∣siast
Richardson the father, in one of his
fine dreams, insists (as others indeed
have done) that great virtue is necessary
even for painters; and that genius has
been less or greater, as virtue and vice
prevailed in the mind of the artist. When
we read an amiable composition, and
observe the character of the author to be
the reverse, there appears an indecent
opposition, which revolts our sensibility,
and makes us contemn the writer as a
miserable impostor.</P>
<P>This science of the mind, noticed by
Shaftesbury, is not metaphysics, but
what has been happily called "the
proper study of mankind;" Man acting
in society. The philosophic genius ex∣cels
in the study of the world; he de∣rives
<PB N="173" REF="195"/>
this advantage from the obscurity
of his situation, the versatility of his
mind, and the habit of meditation.
Those whose <HI>chief occupation</HI> is not <HI>re∣flection,</HI>
limit the knowledge of human
nature to the particular society they are
accustomed. A courtier, a lawyer, and
a merchant, contemplate the human
heart, in different lights; but nature is
ill understood by those whose capacities
are habituated to detect one principle
among many. She has no character, but
many characters; she is not to be sys∣tematized,
but to be pursued. The
man of genius acts upon more general
principles; and makes the human heart
his amusement and his occupation. The
theatre, conducted by such writers, would
become a national school; but we must
then have fewer pantomimes, and such
operas and comedies as we have now,
still fewer than pantomimes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of the political Influence of Authors.</HEAD>
<P>OPINION, says Sophocles, is stronger
than Truth; Opinion is the sovereign of
man; and authors, who are the propa∣gators
of her decrees, are some of the
most important persons in society, and
may be called the ministers of state to
Opinion.</P>
<P>An author has the singular prerogative
of uniting in himself the powers that are
portioned among the higher orders of
society. This reflection may appear fan∣ciful
to those who are destitute of fancy;
and extravagant to those who consider
paper and pens as the composition of the
manufacturer, and who see nothing in
them but rags and feathers.</P>
<P>An eloquent author, who writes in the
immutable language of truth, will one
<PB N="176" REF="198"/>
day be superior to every power in the state.
His influence is active, though hidden;
every truth is an acorn which is laid in
the earth, and which often the longer
it takes to rise, the more vigorous and
magnificent will be it's maturity. What
has been long meditated in the silence of
the study, will one day refound in the
aweful voice of public opinion. The
chief magistrate can command; the se∣nator
can persuade; the judge can de∣cide;
the soldier can conquer. A great
author obtains these various purposes at
once by his solitary labours. His truths
command; his eloquence persuades; his
reason decides; and his works inspire a
rival nation with a more enduring re∣spect,
than even a victorious army.</P>
<P>An island, once inconsiderable in Eu∣rope,
now ranks among the first powers,
arbitrates among other nations, and the
very title of it's inhabitants ensures re∣spect.
<PB N="177" REF="199"/>
Is this owing, alone, to her com∣mercial
prosperity and military force?
One nation has the most flourishing mart
of trade, and another is one of the most
martial people; yet neither inspire man∣kind
with veneration or affection. To
themselves is confined their rude lan∣guage;
studied, perhaps, by merchants,
and corrupted as it is studied. It is
more by an interchange of opinions, than
of spices and specie, that a nation is
esteemed.</P>
<P>Not thus with England; for she derives
her splendour from her writers, as well
as her soldiers, and her navigators. An
empire merely founded on force, is sur∣rounded
by enemies, and often it's sin∣cerest
enemies are to be found in it's own
unparental bosom. An empire distin∣guished
by it's literature, conceals it's
martial iron under the sweetest flowers;
extends her conquests, and diffuses her
<PB N="178" REF="200"/>
pleasures, and among hostile foreigners,
acquires new friends.</P>
<P>This truth we ourselves have experi∣enced.
France preceded us in the stu∣dies
of humanity, and her polite litera∣ture
more forcibly operated on the world,
than even her armies and her fleet; her
civility and refinement vanquished, when
these were defeated. At that period in
society, when the intellectual tastes of
men become so many wants, these gave
an universal diffusion to her language.
The nation that supplies a harvest for
this appetency of the mind, extends it's
dominions in the hearts of the subjects of
other powers. Thus Pope, with equal
sagacity and taste, writes
<Q><L>We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms,</L>
<L>Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let us now contemplate the reverse of
the medal; and the reverse is more beau∣tiful
than the face. In the middle of the
<PB N="179" REF="201"/>
last century, our manners were as un∣known
as our language; and neither
were yet formed and polished. We were
nearly regarded as valorous barbarians,
partaking of the glooms of our clime;
and whom nature had benevolently sepa∣rated,
from neighbours more polished,
and airs more serene. We now hold to
Europe models of solid sense and pro∣found
reasoning. Our late admired
writers have made a neglected language
the study of reflecting foreigners; they
calmed the national hatred of France,
and compelled even our rivals incessantly
to celebrate our merits, when, unlike
themselves, we condescended not to ex∣ult,
but to perform our labours with a
modest silence. Before our present un∣happy
dissentions, it was our nation they
sighed to emulate; and the first writers
of France passed into England to learn
to think and write; or thought and
<PB N="180" REF="202"/>
wrote like Englishmen in France, undis∣mayed
by the terrors of a corrupted go∣vernment.
From our hands they received
the germs of reflection, and the flower of
liberty. This singular revolution in the
human mind was produced not by our
merchants or our admirals, but by our
Lockes, our Popes, and our Addisons.
They have subjugated the minds of mil∣lions
by the energy of an intellectual so∣vereignty.
The works of English authors
are now printed at foreign presses, and
this at least as much as the commerce
and the force of England, proves the
ascendancy of her genius.</P>
<P>The utility of men of letters to na∣tional
purposes is not attended to by
every statesman; for few statesmen (like
other men in office) are either worthy of,
or competent to their employments. The
author is considered by the great as a
subordinate character in society; as if
<PB N="181" REF="203"/>
the art of instructing men, the art of a
Socrates, was much inferior to that of
governing them, the art, often of a Nero,
or a Sardanapalus, and, according to
Machiavel, of a Cesar Borgia.</P>
<P>Political theorists, however, appear to
consider the worst actions of men, as of
far less consequence than the propagation
of their opinions. A dangerous man may
infect his neighbours, but the dangerous
writer spreads a contagion throughout a
nation. Books, and sometimes their au∣thors,
have been burnt; but even this
mode of criticism was found ineffectual.
The flame which destroyed an indivi∣dual,
ever enlightened a people; and the
burning of books, has not yet been con∣sidered
as their refutation.</P>
<P>If those who administer the public
duties of government, were more closely
allied with men of letters, the union
would be happy for the people, and use∣ful
<PB N="182" REF="204"/>
to both. It is unfortunate that those
who govern are not always the most en∣lightened.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The attic Harris of Salisbury, in his "Philosophi∣cal Arrangements," has touched on this topic, and adduced several splendid facts to enforce his judicious reflections. He has shewn, <Q REND="inline">that some of the most il∣lustrious actors upon the great theatre of the world, have been engaged in philosophical speculations.</Q> But what is more to our purpose, we may observe that some of the greatest statesmen have attached themselves to a philosopher. Pericles had his Anaxagoras; Sci∣pio his Polybius; Cesar and Pompey, their Aristo and Cratippus; Zenobia her Longinus; and Plutarch said of Alexander, <Q REND="inline">that he marched against the Persians with better supplies from his preceptor Aristotle, than from his father Philip.</Q></P>
<P>It is also very certain, that the philosophical is not incompatible with the political character. Sir Walter Raleigh; the De Wits; Thuanus; Grotius; Sir William Temple, Bolingbroke, &amp;c. are sufficient to name. Literary men may become ministers of state, but it is more difficult for ministers of state to become literary men.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Authors stand between the governors
and the governed; and they who practice
the art of arranging their thoughts, and
of agitating the passions, who at once
<PB N="183" REF="205"/>
penetrate by their reason, and inflame by
their eloquence, are, among the nations
of modern Europe, what the celebrated
orators of ancient Rome and Athens
were among the assembled citizens. They
awaken, they terrify, they excite, they
conduct the people.</P>
<P>Ministers are constrained to watch till
vigilance is exhausted, and solicitude
sleeps amidst the fluctuations of the pub∣lic
mind, and this public mind is the
creation of the philosophical writer. Is
it to be doubted, that since the immor∣tal
labour of Montesquieu, the old sys∣tems
of government have been often
changed? It is certain the minds of the
people have. Cromwell, the penetrating
Cromwell, was justly alarmed when he
saw the Oceana of Harrington, and
seems to have dreaded the terrible effects
of a little volume, much more than the
plots of the royalists. The single thought
<PB N="184" REF="206"/>
of a man of genius has sometimes chan∣ged
the dispositions of a people, and even
of an age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The great Frederick in his Examen of the Prince of Machiavel, observing that the minds of men are very different from the ferocious age of that Italian politician, says, <Q REND="inline">for which we are obliged to the WRITINGS of those LEARNED MEN, who OF LATE have contributed so much to polish and civilize EUROPE.</Q></P></NOTE> With every creative genius
that arises, a new day rises with him;
it was Montesquieu that introduced in
his nation a taste for the solid and pro∣found,
as well as the gayer and lighter
studies.</P>
<P>Wherever the liberty of the press is
established, authors form as powerful a
class in society, as the highest. For the
great, nothing remains but to annihilate
the press, or to respect the authors. In
Rome, a Persius may have been com∣pelled
to disguise the name of a Nero,
but in England, the name of a tyrant
<PB N="185" REF="207"/>
will be hitched in rhime. Authors are
most to be dreaded in that country where
the liberty and licentiousness of the press,
become a mere matter of sentiment, and
not of discussion; and this sentiment is
left to the people. We who enjoy the
freedom of the press in it's extreme de∣gree,
have no reason to complain of any
privileges of the great.</P>
<P>The people consider authors as their
property; and not unjustly, since the
great suffer them to depend on the
people. The public are never slow to
unite with authors, who, for the sake of
preserving equality, must continually
humble the great. The public, as pa∣trons,
are the most munificent; as abet∣tors,
the most formidable. Their favour
is equitably obtained; they expect an
author to be the bold interpreter of their
secret sentiments, and the protector of
their liberties, as well as the artist of
<PB N="186" REF="208"/>
their pleasures. If this author is perse∣cuted,
he is never forsaken; his cause
becomes the cause of the people; but if
he should prove a wretched adventurer;
who artfully seised on an occasion to serve
his private views, the author is justly
neglected, and the cause alone pursued.
We live in an age, in which an honest
man begins to know his value; and ob∣scurity
and poverty, if adorned with in∣tegrity
and philosophy, are not injurious
to the opinions of a great mind. We
consider that personal merit, is superior
to personal honour; because it now in∣cludes
personal honour. The contrary
will not hold, nor has this always been so.</P>
<P>The public are not displeased when the
great become the patrons of their emi∣nent
authors; it is a kind of homage paid
to the sentiments of the people. But the
author may be a considerable loser, if he
values fame, more than he does a pension.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="209"/>
It is curious to observe the solitary
man of letters in the concealment of his
obscure study, separated from the croud,
unknown to his contemporaries, col∣lecting
the materials of instruction from
every age and every country; combining
with the present the example of the past,
and the prediction of the future; pouring
forth the valuable secrets of his medita∣tions
to posterity; striking with the con∣cussion
of new light the public mind;
and forming the manners, the opinions,
the refinement, and the morals of his
fellow-citizens.—It is curious, I say, to
observe such a man, by some contemned,
by others hated; by some degraded to
an idler or an outcast, and by others
raised to a fancied monster; a Briareus
extending a hundred arms, and in every
arm a brand of sedition; an Argus open∣ing
a hundred eyes, and tracing the
vermin of corruption, creeping to their
<PB N="188" REF="210"/>
most hidden recesses; in a word, as awe∣ful
a figure as that of the vast mountain,
to which the caprice of a tyrant attempted
to give a Colossal form, by commanding
the people to hew it to his immoderate
fancy.</P>
<P>But the philosopher is not, as of late,
too often represented this Colossal ini∣quity.
Legal authority is most secure
when the people are most enlightened;
a simple truth, which I leave to profound
politicians to explain. I shall only cite
the sentiment of an old poet.<Q><L>—De la majestè des Loix,</L>
<L>Appuyant les pouvoirs supremes,</L>
<L>Fait demeurer les diademes</L>
<L>Fermes sur la tête des Rois.</L>
<BIBL>MALHERBE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is a dreadful moment when the
people and the great alike refuse the in∣structions
of the philosopher; whenever
he appears terrible, some great corruption
pervades the state, for he is only armed
<PB N="189" REF="211"/>
with truth. The occupations of the
philosophical student, as connected with
political speculations, are therefore du∣ties
of an exalted nature; some must give
their hands, some their blood, and some
their hours, to the various duties their
country exacts; but there is a small
portion of men, who appear marked out
by nature, for the purpose of cultivating
their thoughts in peace, and to give ac∣tivity
to their sentiments by disclosing
them to the people. The physiognomy
of their minds, wears all that shining
lustre, which distinguished the prophet
after his immediate conference with the
Divinity; for in their compositions, good
sense is embellished by eloquence, and
before they persuade, they convince.
None, but those who devote a life to me∣ditation,
can effect these great purposes;
for they who govern a people, cannot at
the same time enlighten them.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="212"/>
Legislators of extensive views, have
ever protected and honoured men of
letters. We have seen, in this age, two
great powers in Europe testify their pub∣lic
utility, and who have been as soli∣citous
to assemble philosophers, as to
form their armies. Prussia and Russia,
under the government of two great sove∣reigns,
have shewn how far by their aid
an obscure principality, and hordes of
barbarians, may be elevated in the scale
of humanity. The great Frederick in∣vited
to his court the persecuted and un∣happy
literati; and to this holy shrine of
philosophy resorted many a literary pil∣grim.
The imperial Catharine has not
only largely pensioned several illustrious
writers, but honours and animates, by her
gifts, the attempt of every philosopher
who produces a public utility. If these
sovereigns have displayed more art than
humanity, in forging chains for the free∣dom
<PB N="191" REF="213"/>
of men; it shews that an Antoninus and
an Alfred, are more rare than a Frederick
and a Catharine, as the love of philoso∣phy
is less difficult than practical philo∣sophy;
the only philosophy that merits
the name.</P>
<P>It is the philosophical writer who alone
reflects on what is not done, and on what
may be done. He goads the sluggish
veins of government, when a cold indo∣lence
spreads a torpor on it's unhealth∣ful
inactivity. He teaches philanthropy
to direct it's bounties in proper channels,
and this is no inconsiderable good; for
the humanity which distinguishes our
age, is often only retarded by an igno∣rance
of it's necessities; to perceive and
pathetically to describe these necessities,
is reserved for the sensitive philosopher.
It is the characteristic of a man of genius,
in such appeals to our bosoms, that his
glowing mind pours forth those servid ex∣pressions,
<PB N="192" REF="214"/>
that agitation of ideas, those
pictures of truth, which communicate his
own sensations, and animate with his
exquisite soul, the souls of others. The
people are a vast body, and men of
genius are the eyes and hands.</P>
<P>The thousand public utilities, I speak
not of the elegancies, derived from the
multifarious divisions of science and of
art, can alone be perfected by THE PHI∣LOSOPHICAL
GENIUS. Truth is a certain
point in knowledge; ages succeed ages;
and that point is passed, or not attained;
a philosophical genius arises, seises and
fixes it in the vast expanse of nature, se∣cured
by it's own weight from the mobi∣lity
of time. A Newton and a Locke ac∣complish
that in which an Aristotle and
a Descartes failed. But these truths,
which form so many epochs in the hu∣man
understanding, are covered in the
sublime obscurity of nature; how is the
<PB N="193" REF="215"/>
veil to be lifted from Isis? A painful
meditation alone elaborates them into
existence. In the arts, important dis∣coveries
are obtained by accident; but
the precious idea, which depends on a
long train of reasoning, can never be
formed by chance. Philosophers must
meditate; and too often their medita∣tions
are pursued at the cost of their
felicity.</P>
<P>Yet let us not confound true PHILOSO∣PHERS
with dreaming THEORISTS. They
are not more engaged in cultivating the
mind, than the earth; the annals of agri∣culture
are as valuable as the annals of
history; and while they instruct some to
think, they teach others to labour.
PHILOSOPHY extends it's thoughts on
whatever the eye has seen, or the hand
has touched; it herbalises in fields; it
sounds mines; it is on the waters, and
in the forests; it is in the library, and
<PB N="194" REF="216"/>
the laboratory; it arranges the calcula∣tions
of finance; it invents the police of
a city; it erects it's fortifications; it
gives velocity to our fleets; in a word,
it is alike in the solitude of deserts, as in
the populousness of manufactories. The
GENIUS of PHILOSOPHY pierces every
where, and on whatever it rests, like the
sun, it discovers what lay concealed, or
matures what it found imperfect.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. On an Academy of polite Literature, Pen∣sions,
and Prizes.</HEAD>
<P>TO deliver any novel observations on
an academy for the belles lettres is diffi∣cult;
but it is more difficult to pass
such an object in silent regret.</P>
<P>The munificent hand of majesty has
raised an institution to the mimetic art
of painting; and this is a legitimate
claim, which a prince, the commence∣ment
of whose reign was adorned by an
honourable love of the arts, has to the
estimation of posterity. But why polite
literature, which forms the delight and
the solace of a greater portion of the na∣tion
than this art, should have received
no such distinguished approbation from
the Brunswicks, is not to the philosopher,
<PB N="196" REF="218"/>
perhaps, so much an object of surprise
as of sorrow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must not be forgotten that several authors have received pensions; Dr. Henry, Dr. Johnson, and at present Mr. Cowper the poet, have been honoured by his Majesty's attentions. But such solitary rewards are like fountains in the burning deserts of Arabia. One of his Majesty's most illustrious actions is his conver∣sation with Dr. Johnson, in which an amiable and re∣flecting mind adds to the dignity of the Monarch. George II. remonstrated with Lord Hervey for writing verses, which be observed might be proper in Mr. Pope, or those who lived by the <HI>business,</HI> but very un∣becoming a <HI>Lord.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I begin these observations with a lite∣ral
transcription of the opening of Sir
Joshua Reynolds's first discourse. The
President says, <Q REND="inline">it is indeed difficult to
give any other reason why an empire,
like that of BRITAIN, should so long
have wanted an ornament so suitable
to it's greatness, than that slow pro∣gression
of things, which naturally
makes elegance and refinement the last
effect of opulence and power.</Q>—Of
<PB N="197" REF="219"/>
opulence and power, have the higher
classes of our nation a deficient measure?
I doubt, indeed, if they really possess, as
a body, or elegance or refinement. The
philosopher is not dazzled by elegance
and refinement in manners; he does not
confound the brilliancy of equipages with
the energies of the mind. To his con∣templative
eye it is possible that an opu∣lent
and splendid nation may be barba∣rous
and gross; as we observe in the
individual, who, adorned by the insignia
of honour, and loaded with incalculable
wealth, may at the same time have all
the barbarity of mind which marks and
degrades the lowest of the populace.
Should the greater part of the nobility of
any country be more partial to pugilists
and jockies, than to artists and philoso∣phers,
the historian would be justified in
recording that the genius of it's nobility
was barbarous and gross. It is almost
<PB N="198" REF="220"/>
peculiar to literature, that whenever it's
professors feel themselves contemned or
neglected, to vindicate their cause, they
have only to record this contempt and
this neglect.</P>
<P>I would ask why the art of writing is
not deserving of the same regard as the
art of painting? And then I would en∣quire,
what painting can urge in it's
own cause, which will entitle it to a su∣periority
over the art of composition?</P>
<P>But it may be urged that an institution
of this kind, while it has been recom∣mended
by some, has been opposed by
others. Perhaps, in our country, it has
never been examined with the attention
such an object claims; often it's defects
have been rendered prominent, and it's
benefits omitted; it's inabilities have
been displayed, and it's powers have been
concealed; it has often been regarded as
a common place for ridicule, not as a
discussion for reason.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="221"/>
Johnson, in his Life of Swift, has
given some plausible arguments against
the academy which Swift proposed; the
arguments of this great man, more spe∣cious
than just, relate not to our present
subject; for the academy Swift was de∣sirous
of establishing, was merely an imi∣tation
of the French academy; for the
polishing, refining, and embellishing the
language. The English language now
wants no academy for it's improvements;
it has few acquisitions to make, but much
to preserve.</P>
<P>A literary institution might be formed,
in which the errors of former academies
might be obviated, and the advanced
genius of our times might add it's own
valuable inventions. To improve the
past is not difficult; but whether such an
academy would be a national utility, is
an important question, not, perhaps,
difficult to resolve.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="222"/>
There is one kind of men, to whom
no student would address himself on sub∣jects
of science and taste. At the siege
of Athens, the barbarous Sylla com∣manded
the shady walks of the ACADEMY
(that resort of the Muses which has left
it's name to all future literary societies)
to be torn up, and the hallowed trees to
be converted into martial machines. I
address myself not to the living Syllas,
who are as inimical to a modern, as their
ferocious model was to the first academy.
The <HI>Omars</HI> of literature (the expression
be pardoned) we know are the enemies
of the <HI>Homers.</HI></P>
<P>On the first glance we take of the sub∣ject,
the French academy, properly so
distinguished, presents itself. It's la∣bours
have not been great; because it's
object was limited to the cultivation of
the language. But it obtained it's ob∣ject
with all it's possible accomplishment.
<PB N="201" REF="223"/>
I trace the history of French style, in the
harangues of this academy. The first
are cold, dry, and full of those common
turns of expression, which were doubtless
considered as the <HI>curiosa felicitas,</HI> but
which, by their reiterated appearance,
shew the barrenness of their diction, and
the paucity of happy expressions. The
language was not yet formed; and the
academy had commenced with nearly an
empty treasury. About the middle vo∣lumes,
eloquence occasionally appears,
an accession of new turns enrich the ha∣rangues,
and if the style is not yet splen∣did,
it is not devoid of grace. The con∣cluding
volumes wear a brilliant appear∣ance;
a warmth of colouring, a boldness
of expression, and all the seduction of
animated eloquence. If these volumes
owe something to happier topics, it is
necessary to observe, that some subjects
not less interesting, in the early volumes,
have all the deficiencies of style.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="224"/>
Some will urge that an author can
himself perform better than a society,
and the dictionaries of Furetiere and
Johnson, may be quoted as having been
performed without the aid of an aca∣demy.</P>
<P>I would not deny that one superior
genius is capable of obtaining what forty
inferior ones can never accomplish; and
I even add, that one great author can
perform better than forty great authors.
No celebrated work has yet been com∣posed
by the united talents of several;
but many great men have conjoined their
abilities in vain, in various works.</P>
<P>The mechanical operation of compi∣ling
a dictionary, however, I believe,
may be better effected by a society, than
by an individual. The dictionary of
Johnson, though perhaps it could not be
more finely executed, might have been
considerably augmented by a society.
<PB N="203" REF="225"/>
Does not this great man himself, hostile
as he appears to academies, inconsciously
acknowledge their utility, by complain∣ing
that his labour was not formed under
"the shelter of academic bowers."</P>
<P>It appears to me, that the happiest
effect is obtained when an academy and
an individual unite their powers. I ex∣plain
myself by the following circum∣stance.</P>
<P>D'Alembert, in his Eloge of the Abbè
Desmarais, observes, that the long arti∣cles
of the French dictionary were written
by him, and that the public considered
them as more finished, and more satis∣factory
than the short ones. D'Alembert
gives the reason. He observes, that
<Q REND="inline">the brevity of articles of little extent,
allowed of their being the work of the
whole society; and that a society col∣lected
in a body, disturbed in it's de∣cisions
by twenty different opinions,
<PB N="204" REF="226"/>
which cross and destroy one another,
must with difficulty attain to satisfy it∣self
and it's readers; but, on the con∣trary,
the great articles, indispensably
given to the care of an individual, ac∣quire,
in passing through his hands,
all the perfection which the self-love of
the writer can give, animated also by
the academical fervour.</Q></P>
<P>This judicious reflection of one of the
most judicious writers of France, may
serve to prove that a work is best per∣formed
by an individual; but that an
individual, while he labours under the
eye of a society, feels a stimulative in
that society, which otherwise had been
wanting.</P>
<P>And this is the great end and utility of
such an institution. It's various advan∣tages
are, perhaps, sufficiently obvious;
but the vast influence it has over writers,
has not, perhaps, been sufficiently re∣marked.
<PB N="205" REF="227"/>
It animates not only the indi∣viduals
of the society, but every indivi∣dual
who aspires to become a member
of the society, and to wear, as Voltaire
said, the blue ribband of literature. By
a distribution of prizes, it diffuses an
emulation to the remotest parts of the
kingdom, and introduces to the public
those ingenuous youths, whom their situ∣ation
conceals from the world. By it's
own memoirs, written by the members,
it forms the most valuable literary re∣positories
in a nation. To reflect on
these advantages may not be useless.</P>
<P>Some of the inferior benefits attending
such an institution, are indisputable. In
these literary conferences, the taste of
every associate would become more bril∣liant,
because it would continually re∣ceive
the attrition and contact, it is to

in the nation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following observations on <HI>Academies,</HI> cited by Goujet in his Bibliotheque Francoise, vol. 2. p. 453, are from one of the numerous political works of the Abbè de Saint Pierre. They are too ingenious to be passed in silence. He says, <Q REND="inline">what supplies among men the method of universities, is the method of academies, or conferences which are held on mat∣ters of their profession, or their taste. They do not hear a professor, or a regent, but they hear one an∣other. They hear, with greater attention, those who have acquired greater reputation in the com∣pany; they improve by a reciprocation of obser∣vations; they contradict their equals, and they are contradicted; and the authority of some, the con∣tradiction of others, the dread of contempt or ridi∣cule, the desire of applause, and of surpassing their equals; the wish of being useful to our country, animate all in their labour, and augment their ap∣plication and attention, from which arises the growth and extension of mind.</Q></P></NOTE> In cases of emergency,
recourse would be had to the academy,
and a Robertson would not stand in such
need, as we have seen, of the advice of an
inferior mind. The paradoxes in poetry
of a Johnson, would have been opposed
before their publication, or at least, the
work must have issued into the world
<PB N="207" REF="229"/>
without the sanction of the academy,
which would have been a tacit censure.
The society should be provided with as∣sociates
in the various classes of litera∣ture;
it should have it's grammarians,
it's historians, and it's metaphysicians,
as well as it's poets, it's orators, and it's
philosophers. In this hive of literary
bees, no indolent member should remain
a member; all must be animation, all
must be labour. And that no excuse
may be framed of neglect to the cause of
literature, pensions should be given to
those who may stand in want of them;
for pensions to all will not be wanted,
since some will labour for glory, though
some may also want bread.</P>
<P>But even LITERARY PENSIONS have
been ridiculed; and it is not unnecessary
to offer some reflections on them.</P>
<P>There are two opinions relative to the
state of men of genius. One party ima∣gine
<PB N="208" REF="230"/>
that no protection from the great,
or a court, is necessary for the encou∣ragement
of artists; and the other are
persuaded, that when honours and pen∣sions
are judiciously distributed, it ex∣cites
emulation in the young, and gives
that leisure to those on whom they are
bestowed, so necessary to some, to cul∣tivate
their talents. They think with
Boileau, that
<Q>Un AUGUSTE aisement peut faire des VIRGILES.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Orford, honourably known un∣der
the name of Horace Walpole (a name
that presents to the mind, taste, fancy,
and learning) has said in his preface to
his Anecdotes of Painting, <Q REND="inline">want of
protection is the apology for want of
genius. Milton and Fontaine did not
write in the bask of court favour. A
poet or a painter may want an equi∣page,
or a villa, by wanting protection:
<PB N="209" REF="231"/>
they can always afford to buy ink and
paper, colours and pencil. Mr. Ho∣garth
has received no honours, but
universal admiration.</Q></P>
<P>I reply to his Lordship, that it is true
the favour of a court knighted Blackmore,
and pensioned Quarles; and both were
miserable poets; but if a court cannot
convert dull men into men of genius, it
may preserve men of genius from be∣coming
dull men. It might have af∣forded
Dryden that studious leisure which
he ever wanted, and which has given us
imperfect tragedies, and incorrect poems,
in lieu of finished compositions, and the
regular flights of a noble genius. It
might have animated a Gainsborough to
form an English school in landscape,
which it is said was his favourite, but
neglected pursuit. As for the equipage
and villa of the poet or the painter, these
they leave to the idle connoisseur and
<PB N="210" REF="232"/>
the vain actor. Nor must we consent to
the insulting observation that they may
always buy ink and paper, colours and
pencils. Is it sufficient for a delicate and
sensitive mind to have such implements
to awaken the brilliancy of imagination?
Is the picture uncommon to see a great
genius with his pens or his pencils on the
table, leaning over them in that secret
agony of spirit, which murders fancy,
and spreads a torpor on the soul? Had
Chatterton been protected, not with an
equipage or a villa, but with a pension,
the youth had not perished; but this
unhappy poet instructs us, that pens and
paper are not the only requisites to cherish
genius.</P>
<P>On the other side, so different are the
opinions of even men of letters on this
subject, the French writers (and the
greatest of them received their pensions
without any injury to their genius) con∣tinually
<PB N="211" REF="233"/>
point to England as a model of
literary protection. They tell us that
Addison was Secretary of State; Newton
and Locke, Commissioners; Swift al∣most
Prime Minister; and Prior an
Ambassador.</P>
<P>If it is urged that the public are the
best patrons, and that several popular
authors have left fervid expressions as
memorials of their gratitude; I reply,
that the public are more munificent pa∣trons
than princes, provided that the
genius of an author happens to take a
popular turn. But of authors, few can
be popular; for most of the departments
in literature require the study of many
years, and cannot be perfected till a late
period. Such are all the exact sciences,
and every species of erudition. The
historian and the novelist may gratify the
public taste, but what is to become of
the antiquary and the mathematician?</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="234"/>
It is one certain evil, consequent to the
want of patronage, that a writer of great
genius, when he discovers that he has
nothing but his talents, and that the
public attention must be roused by some
extravagant novelty, will consult the
worst dispositions of the public; because
these are the most universal; and instead
of composing a beautiful poem, he will
write a dreadful satire; instead of a his∣tory,
a libel; and instead of a moral
romance, some scandalous memoirs.</P>
<P>Men of genius, pensioned by a court,
will be enabled to indulge their own
manner, though it might not immedi∣ately
be popular. He who writes in the
proper repose of mind, and with regu∣larity
of application, will give his own
natural physiognomy, and not that arti∣ficial
countenance which those who court
the mob are obliged to assume.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="235"/>
If I am told, that to accept pensions is
not congenial to the free spirit of a Briton,
I reply, that literary pensions, unlike
others, are honourable to the donor, and
the pensioner. There is surely less ser∣vility
in receiving a gratuitous gift from
an enlightened monarch, than the wages
of an inhuman bookseller.</P>
<P>There is, I think, a reward for litera∣ture,
of still greater utility than even
pensions.</P>
<P>The distribution of PRIZES appears of
greater utility than PENSIONS. A pension
preserves one man of letters, but a prize
may give birth to many. He who must
satisfy a judge, and surpass a rival, will not
satisfy himself till he has surpassed him∣self;
he will not try merely to give a good
work, but the best; and the vigilance of
ambition will sometimes supply the de∣ficiencies
of genius. If he is not yet
crowned with the splendid reward, he
<PB N="214" REF="236"/>
may merit the animation of an honour∣able
notice; if he cannot obtain a tri∣umph,
an ovation may be reserved for
him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An <HI>ovation,</HI> among the Romans, was a <HI>lesser tri∣umph.</HI> At an ovation, the General entered the city on foot or on horsebock; but in a triumph he rode in a chariot.</NOTE> Useful topics, which might not
have been attempted by an individual,
are dispersed about the nation. We
have seen lately, a prize in the Irish aca∣demy
produce a valuable "Essay on the
best means of providing for the Poor."
Subjects of national importance are not
attempted because a vender of literature
may not chuse to undertake them; a
prize would bestow honour and assistance
on the ingenious speculator. It is by
her prizes, as well as by her academies,
that France has always preceded us, and
that her ingenuity is made to surpass our
genius.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>When the imperfect sailing of our marine was dis∣cussed, January 6, in this year, Admiral Gardner al∣ledged the following reason for the superiority of the French in this particular. He said, <Q REND="inline">to his know∣ledge the French ships sailed better than the English, owing to their different construction. Whenever a ship was to be built in France, PREMIUMS were offered for the best plan; the several plans were then referred to an ACADEMY of Sciences, and the most perfect always adopted. He entertained no doubt, but if PREMIUMS were held out here, for good mo∣dels, our ships would be much better.</Q>—Here we observe, that an <HI>Admiral,</HI> on the subject of <HI>Marine,</HI> acknowledges the utility of PRIZES and ACADEMIES; and we presume, that not one enlightened artist but would employ the same language respecting his own art. By witholding these encouragements, many in∣genious artists have perished with grief, and many have renounced their country, and enriched foreigners with those improvements their ungrateful nation de∣nied even their notice.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="237"/>
While this academy for polite litera∣ture
would be thus effecting a great na∣tional
utility, their own memoirs would
be invaluable. The Academy of the
Belles Lettres in France, has formed a
collection of historical, critical, literary,
and miscellaneous information, unequal∣led
in any nation. Our most accom∣plished
historians cite them as their
<PB N="216" REF="238"/>
authorities. The learning of a learned
age is rendered instructive; and what
becomes dull and insipid in a Salmasius
and a Scaliger, delight with those who
do not think knowledge consists in the
heavy and unprofitable science of dates,
unconnected facts, and titles of books;
but in reflection and in taste. Know∣ledge
is only knowledge when it is render∣ed
accessible to the nation; it must be
shewn to, and handled by the multitude,
and not preserved like an useless piece of
antiquity in the collections of the curious.</P>
<P>France had literary societies of every
kind; her provincial academies were
numerous; and I cannot but attribute her
superiority in a fine and brilliant elo∣quence;
a language of criticism that
analyses and paints our sensations; and
their seductive art of composition to
these lettered confraternities. Her reli∣gion
was friendly to retirement; and the
<PB N="217" REF="239"/>
retirement of studious men is rarely a
barren leisure, and a proud indolence.
It is a justice we owe to letters, and to
an extinct order of men, to acknowledge
the invaluable labours of many monastic
societies of modern times. To the Port
Royal the European youth were long in∣debted
for the initiatory books of learn∣ing,
and for versions of the ancients, not yet
neglected. To the learned Benedictines
we owe their extensive "Literary History
of France," which, though carried to
13 volumes in 4to. reaches only to the
12th century. Many, not less interesting,
nor vast, might be mentioned. Labours
like these, can never be satisfactorily per∣formed
by any individual; One, may be
permitted to devote himself to the com∣position
of the work, but many hands and
many eyes must collect the materials, and
must watch over the execution. We
have no such Literary History of Eng∣land;
<PB N="218" REF="240"/>
and I may venture to predict we
never can, if an academy of polite lite∣rature
is not instituted.</P>
<P>There remains one observation to be
made on the beneficial effect of literary
societies dispersed in the kingdom.
Wherever such exist, there will never
appear in the vicinage a youth of genius,
but the members will perceive his abi∣lities,
and will receive him or as a parent,
or as a friend. A considerable number
of the illustrious literati of France, were
first induced to devote themselves to
study by the penetration of their supe∣riors,
or having found an asylum in some
monastery, indulged their prevailing dis∣position.</P>
<P>The institution of literary societies is
so much desired, and the want is so
urgent, that the discernment of indivi∣duals
has of late attempted to supply this
dishonourable deficiency by associations
<PB N="219" REF="241"/>
in the metropolis, as well as in some of
our provincial towns. The Manchester
society has merited the approbation of
the public.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the pleasure of announcing a volume of Miscellanies in the press, by a LITERARY SOCIETY established at EXETER. It is their first fruits.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we cannot reasonably expect that
a private society will ever answer the
ideas of the public, and become of na∣tional
utility. De Foe, in his "Essay
on Projects, (who projected millions
for the nation, but was generally con∣fined
for his own debts) gives some ob∣servations
respecting the institution of an
academy for polite literature, but he
chiefly regards it in the view of refining
and adjusting the language. He says,
p. 229, that he was once a member of
a society who attempted this noble de∣sign,
but it's failure he attributes to the
greatness of the work and the modesty of
<PB N="220" REF="242"/>
the gentlemen; and concludes by saying
that we want a Richelieu to commence
such a work. I believe it was not the
modesty of the members, nor the great∣ness
of the work, which occasioned it's
failure; but many other reasons, which
will always operate against private literary
societies.</P>
<P>A society of friends find no great dif∣ficulty
to be pleased with the composi∣tions
of each other; many will be ad∣mitted
to such a society, more out of
affection, than for their ability. It is
the great requisite of an academy, that
all the members should be professed stu∣dents,
whose SOLE OCCUPATION is litera∣ture,
and whose life is devoted to acade∣demical
functions. If PENSIONS and
PRIZES are added to the establishment,
we have then as perfect an ACADEMY,
perhaps, as possibly can exist.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="243"/>
This grand and desirable object can
alone be obtained, as such hitherto have
been obtained, by the sanction of the
Sovereign, and the applause of the
People. Such an institution would not
alone be a national ornament; for to
hold out rewards to genius, and to dif∣fuse
among the people the humanising
and peaceful pursuits of literature, has
never yet been considered by politicians
as a vain and an unimportant purpose.</P>
<P>Such is the wonderful influence of a
love of letters in a nation, that it has
often disguised the deformity of despo∣tism,
and rendered even a nation of
slaves, a polished, a refined, and a happy
people.</P>
<P>At the present melancholy moment,
when Europe appears hostile to Reason,
and to Humanity, let us indulge the
hope, that this institution may become
the ornament of PEACE—of a Peace, that
<PB N="222" REF="244"/>
by it's duration may resemble the vision
of an admirable philanthropist and a
poor politician, the vision of the Abbè
de Saint Pierre,—AN UNIVERSAL PEACE.
When the principle of Government is
VIRTUE, the action of that Government
will be PEACE; Governments are, how∣ever,
always in war.</P>

<P>In 1733, the Author composing his Olympiad, felt
himself suddenly moved, even to tears, in ex∣pressing
the separation of two tender Lovers.

how little reasonable and solid a foundation the
others had, which so frequently agitated us in
this state of our existence.</P>

<P>I TAKE this opportunity of declaring, that having
been repeatedly attacked in the most illiberal manner
by <HI>WILLIAM GRAHAM,</HI> respecting an Anecdote of
<HI>Mrs. MACAULEY'S</HI> mutilation of a Harleian MS.
that no just reason has yet been assigned to afford me
the pleasure of retracting this accusation against a
Lady of her eminent talents.</P>
<P>At present, the mysterious note of <HI>Dr. MORTON</HI>
remains unexplained, yet if it is allowed to have
any meaning, it must convey a charge against the
Historian, and as such will no doubt be received by
impartial posterity.</P>
<P>This, however, I concede, that I cannot <HI>prove</HI>
this circumstance, for I was not born when it took
place. It rests not upon the floating reports of thirty
years, but in the circumstantial evidence of the Note
which has been inserted in it's <HI>unmutilated</HI> state, in
several literary journals. I say unmutilated, for
<HI>Mr. G.</HI> had the ingenuity to give it only in the state
which was most adapted to his purpose.</P>
