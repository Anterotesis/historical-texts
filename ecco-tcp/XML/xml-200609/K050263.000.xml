<HEAD>And what if the Pretender should come? OR, SOME Considerations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the Danger of the Pretender is real∣ly so great as the Noise which some make about it seems to suppose, if the Hopes of his Coming are so well grounded, as some of his Friends seem to boast, it behoves us who are to be the Sub∣jects of the Approaching Revolution, which his Success must necessarily bring with it, to apply ourselves seriously to examine what our Part will be in the Play, that so we may prepare ourselves to act as becomes us, both with Respect to the Government we are now under, and with Respect to the Government we may be under, when the Success he promises himself shall (if ever it shall) answer his Expectation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
In order to this it is necessary to state, with what Plainness the Circumstances of the Case will admit, the several Appear∣ances of the Thing itself. (1.) <HI>As they are</HI> offered to us by the respective Parties who are for or against it. (2.) <HI>As they</HI> really appear by an Impartial Deduction from them both, without the least Byass either to one Side or other; that so the People of <HI>Britain</HI> may settle and compose their Thoughts a little in this Great, and at present Popular Debate, and may neither be terrified or affrighted with Mischiefs, which have no Reason or Foundation in them, and which give no Ground for their Apprehensions; and on the other Hand, may not promise to themselves greater Things from the Pretender, if he should come hither, than he will be able to perform for them; in order to this we are to consider the Pretender in his Person, and in his Circumstances. (1.) The Per∣son who we call the Pretender: It has been so much debated, and such strong Parties have been made on both Sides to prove or disprove the Legitimacy of his Birth, that it seems needless here to enter into that Dispute; the Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> one of the most Furious Opposers of the Name and Interest of the Pretender, openly grants his Legitimacy, and pretends to ar∣gue
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
against his Admission from Principles and Foundations of his own Forming; we shall let alone his Principles and Foundati∣ons here, as we do his Arguments, and on∣ly take him by the Handle which he fairly gives us, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he grants <HI>the Person of the Pretender Legitimate</HI>; if this be so, if the Person we contend about be the Lawful true Son of King <HI>James</HI>'s Queen, the Dispute whether he be the Real Son of the King will be quite out of the Question; because by the Laws of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and of the whole World, a Child Born in Wedlock shall inherit, as Heir of the Mother's Husband, whether Begotten by him, as his Real Father, or not. Now to come at the true Design of this Work, the Business is, to hear (as above) what either Side have to say to this Point. The Friends of his Birth and Succession argue upon it thus, if the Person be lawfully Begotten, <HI>that is,</HI> if Born really of the Body of the Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> during the Life of King <HI>James,</HI> he was without any Exception his Lawful Son; <HI>if</HI> he was his Lawful Son, he was his Lawful Heir; <HI>if</HI> he was his Law∣ful Heir, why is he not our Lawful King? <HI>Since</HI> Hereditary Right is Indefeasible, and is lately acknowledged to be so; and that the Doctrine of Hereditary Right being In∣defeasible, is a Church of <HI>England,</HI> Doctrine
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
ever received by the Church, and inse∣parable from the true Members of the Church, the contrary being the stigmati∣zing Character of Republicans, King-killers, Enemies to Monarchy, Presbyterians, and Phanaticks: The Enemies of the Birth and Succession of the Person called the Pre∣tender argue upon it thus, <HI>That</HI> he is the Lawfully Begotten, or Son Born really of the Body of the Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of the late King <HI>James, they doubt</HI>; and they are justified in doubting of it, because no sufficient Steps were taken in the proper Season of it, <HI>either before his Birth,</HI> to convince such Persons as were more immediately concerned to know the Truth of it, that the Queen was really with Child, which might have been done past all Contradiction at that Time, more than ever after: <HI>Or at his Birth,</HI> to have such Persons as were more immediately con∣cern'd, <HI>such as Her Present Majesty,</HI> &amp;c. thoroughly convinc'd of the Queen being really deliver'd of a Child, by being Present at the Time of the Queen's Labour and De∣livery. This being omitted, which was the Affirmative, <HI>say they,</HI> which ought to have been proved, we ought not to be concerned in the Proof of the Negative, which by the Nature of the Thing could not be equally certain; and therefore we might be justly permitted to conclude, that the Child was
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
a Spurious, Unfair Production, put upon the Nation; for which Reason we reject him, and have now, by a Legal and Just Authority, deposed his Father and him, and settled the Succession upon the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> being Protestants.</P>
<P>The Matter of his Title standing thus, divides the Nation into Two Parties, one Side for, and the other against, the Succes∣sion, either of the Pretender, or the House of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and either Side calling the other the Pretender; so that if we were to use the Parties Language, we must say, one Side is for, and the other Side against, either of the <HI>Pretenders</HI>; what the Visible Probabi∣lities of either of these Claims succeeding are, is not the Present Case; the Nation appears at this Time strangely agitated between the Fears of one Party, and the Hopes of the other, each extenuating and aggravating, as their several Parties and Affections guide them, by which the Publick Disorder is very much encreased; what either of them have to alledge is our present Work to en∣quire; but more particularly what are the real or pretended Advantages of the expect∣ed Reign of him, who we are allow'd to distinguish by the Name of <HI>the Pretender</HI>; for his Friends here would have very little to say to move us to receive him, if they were not able to lay before us such Pro∣spects
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
of National Advantages, and such Views of Prosperity, as would be sufficient to prevail with those who have their Eyes upon the Good of their Country, and of their Posterity after them.</P>
<P>That then a Case so Popular, and of so much Consequence as this is, may not want such due Supports as the Nature of the Thing will allow, and especially since the Advantages and good Consequences of the Thing itself are so many, and so easie to be seen as his Friends alledge; why should not the Good People of <HI>Britain</HI> be made easie, and their Fears be turned into Peaceable Satisfa∣ction, by seeing that this Devil may not be so Black as he is Painted; and that the Noise made of the Pretender and the frightful Things said of his Coming, and of his being receiv'd here, may not be made greater Scarecrows to us, than they really are; and <HI>after all that has been said, if</HI> it should appear that the Advantages of the Pretender's Succession are really greater to us, and the Dangers less to us, than those of the Succession of <HI>HANOVER,</HI> then much of their Dif∣ficulties would be over, who standing Neu∣ter as to Persons appear against the Preten∣der, only because they are made to believe strange and terrible Things of what shall befal the Nation in Case of his Coming in, <HI>such as</HI> Popery, Slavery, <HI>French</HI> Power,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
destroying of our Credit, and devouring our Funds, (as that Scandalous Scribler, the <HI>Review,</HI> has been labouring to suggest,) with many other Things which we shall endeavour to expose to you, as they deserve. <HI>If</HI> we say it should appear then that the Dangers and Disadvantages of the Pretender's Succession are less than those of the House of <HI>HANOVER,</HI> who, because of an Act of Parliament, you know must not be called <HI>Pretenders</HI>; then there will re∣main nothing more to be said on that Score, but the Debate must be of the Reasonableness and Justice on either Side, for their Admittance, and there we que∣stion not but the Side we are really plead∣ing for will have the Advantage.</P>
<P>To begin then with that most Popular and Affrighting Argument now made Use of, as the Bugbear of the People, against several other Things besides Jacobitism, we mean <HI>French Greatness:</HI> It is most evi∣dent that the Fear of this must, by the Na∣ture of the Thing, be effectually removed upon our receiving <HI>the Pretender</HI>; the Grounds and Reasons why <HI>French</HI> Great∣ness is rendred Formidable to us, and so much Weight supposed to be in it, that like the Name of <HI>Scanderberg,</HI> we fright our very Children with it, lye only in this, that we suggest the King of <HI>France</HI> being a pro∣fest
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Enemy to the Peace, and the Liberty of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will most certainly, as soon as he can a little recover himself, ex∣ercise all that Formidable Power to put the Pretender upon us, and not only to place him upon the Throne of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but to Maintain and Hold him up in it, against all the Opposition, either of the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> or the Confederate Princes Leagued with the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> who are in the Interest of his Claim, or of his Party. Now it is evident, that upon a Peaceable ad∣mitting this Person, whom they call the Pretender, to Receive and Enjoy the Crown here, all that Formidable Power becomes your Friend, and <HI>the being so</HI> must neces∣sarily take off from it every Thing that is called Terrible; forasmuch as the greater Terror and Amusement the Power we ap∣prehend really carries with it, the greater is the Tranquility and Satisfaction which accrues to us, when we have the Friend∣ship of that Power which was so Formida∣ble to us before: The Power of <HI>France</HI> is represented at this Time very terrible, and the Writers who speak of it apply it warm to our Imaginations, as that from whence we ought justly to apprehend the Impossi∣bility of keeping out the Pretender, and this, notwithstanding they allow themselves at the same Time to suppose all the Confede∣rate
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to be Engaged, as well by their own Interest, as by the New Treaties of Barrier and Guarantee, to Sup∣port and to Assist the Claim of the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and his Party. Now if this Power be so Great, and so Formidable, as they alledge, will it not on the other Side add a Proportion of Encrease to our Satis∣faction, that this Power will be wholly in Friendship and League with us; and en∣gaged to concern itself for the quieting our Fears of other Foreign Invaders; forasmuch as having once concern'd itself to set the Person of the Pretender upon the Throne, it cannot be supposed but it shall be equal∣ly concern'd to Support and Maintain him in that Possession, as what will mightily conduce to the carrying on the other Pro∣jects of his Greatness and Glory with the rest of <HI>Europe</HI>; in which it will be very much his Interest to secure himself from any Op∣position he might meet with from this Nati∣on, or from such as might be rendred Pow∣erful by our Assistance. An Eminent In∣stance we have of this in the Mighty Efforts the <HI>French</HI> Nation have made for Planting, and Preserving when Planted, a Grandson of <HI>France</HI> upon the Throne of <HI>Spain</HI>; and how Eminent are the Advantages to <HI>France</HI> from the Success of that Undertaking; of what less Consequence then would it be to
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
the August Monarchy of <HI>France,</HI> to Secure and Engage to himself the constant Friend∣ship and Assistance of the Power of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which he would necessarily do, by the placing this Person upon the Throne, who would thereby in Gratitude be engaged to contribute his utmost in Return to the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the carrying on his Glorious Designs in the rest of <HI>Europe.</HI> While then we become thus necessary to the King of <HI>France,</HI> Reason dictates that he would be our Fast Friend, our Constant Confederate, our Allie, firmly engaged to Secure our Sovereign, and Protect our People from the Insults and Attempts of all the World: Being thus engaged reciprocal∣ly with the King of <HI>France,</HI> there must ne∣cessarily be an End of all the Fears and Jealousies, of all the Apprehensions and Doubts, which now so Amuse us, and appear so Formidable to us from the Prospect of the Power and Greatness of <HI>France</HI>; then we shall on the contrary say to the World, the stronger the King of <HI>France</HI> is, the bet∣ter for the King of <HI>England</HI>; and what is best for the King, must be so for his Peo∣ple; for it is a most unnatural Way of Arguing, to suppose the Interest of a King, and of his People, to be different from one another.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
And is not this then an Advantage in∣comparably greater to <HI>Britain,</HI> when the Pretender shall be upon the Throne, than any we can propose to ourselves in the pre∣sent uneasie Posture of Affairs, which it must be acknowledged we are in now, when we cannot sleep in Quiet, for the terrible Apprehensions of being over-run by the For∣midable Power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Let us also consider the many other Ad∣vantages which may accrue to this Nation, by a nearer Conjunction, and closer Union, with <HI>France,</HI> such as Encrease of Com∣merce, Encouragement of Manufactures, Ballance of Trade; every one knows how vast an Advantage we reaped by the <HI>French</HI> Trade in Former Times, and how many Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year we gain'd by it, when the Ballance of Trade between us and <HI>France</HI> run so many Milli∣ons of <HI>Livres</HI> Annually <HI>against</HI> the <HI>French</HI> by the vast Exportation of our Goods to them, and the small Import which we re∣ceiv'd from them again, and by the Con∣stant Flux of Money in <HI>Specie,</HI> which we drew from them every Year, upon Court Occasions, to the inexpressible Benefit of the Nation, and Enriching of the Subject, of which we shall have Occasion to speak here∣after more fully.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
In the mean Time it were to be wished that our People, who are so bugbear'd with Words, and terrified with the Name of <HI>French, French Power, French Greatness,</HI> and the like, as if <HI>England</HI> could not Subsist, and the Queen of <HI>England</HI> was not Able to keep upon Her Throne any longer than the King of <HI>France</HI> pleased, and that Her Majesty was going to be a meer Servant to the <HI>French</HI> King, would consider that this is an unanswerable Argument for the Coming of the Pretender, that we may make this so Formidable Prince our Friend, have all his Power engaged in our Interest, and see him going on Hand in Hand with us, in the securing us against all Sorts of Encroachments whatsoever: For if the King of <HI>France</HI> be such an Invin∣cible Mighty Monarch, that we are nothing in his Eyes, or in his Hands; and that nei∣ther <HI>Britain,</HI> or all the Friends <HI>Britain</HI> can make, are able to deliver us from him; then it must be our great Advantage to have the Pretender be our King, that we may be out of the Danger of this Formida∣ble <HI>French</HI> Power, being our Enemy; and that on the other Hand, we may have so Potent, so Powerful, so Invincible, a Prince be our Friend. The Case is evidently laid down to every common Understanding, in the Example of <HI>Spain</HI>; <HI>till now,</HI> the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> for many Ages have been over-run,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
and impoverished, by their continued Wars with the <HI>French,</HI> and it was not doubted but one Time or other they would have been entirely conquered by the King of <HI>France,</HI> and have become a meer Province of <HI>France</HI>; whereas now, having but con∣sented to receive a King from the Hands of the invincible Monarch, they are made easie as to the former Danger they were always in, are now most safe under the Protection of <HI>France</HI>; and he who before was their Terror, is now their Safety, and being safe from him, it appears they are so from all the World.</P>
<P>Would it not then be the manifest Ad∣vantage of this Nation to be likewise se∣cur'd from the dangerous Power of <HI>France,</HI> and make that Potentate our fast Friend, who it is so apparent we are not able to resist as an Enemy? This is reducing the <HI>French</HI> Power the softest Way, if not the best and shortest Way; for if it does not reduce the Power itself, it brings it into such a Circumstance, as that all the Terror of it is removed, and we embrace that as our Safety and Satisfaction, which really is, and ought to be, our Terror and Aversion; this must of Necessity be our great Ad∣vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
How strange is it that none of our Peo∣ple have yet thought of this Way of secu∣ring their Native Country from the Insults of <HI>France?</HI> Were but the Pretender once re∣ceived as our King, we have no more Dis∣putes with the King of <HI>France,</HI> he has no Pretence to Invade or Disturb us; what a quiet World would it be with us in such a Case, when the greatest Monarch in the Universe should be our fast Friend, and be in our Interest to prevent any of the Incon∣veniencies which might happen to us from the Disgust of other Neighbours, who may be dissatisfied with us upon other Accounts: As to the terrible Things which some Peo¦ple fright us, and themselves with, from the Influence which <HI>French</HI> Councils may have upon us, and of <HI>French</HI> Methods of Government being introduced among us; these we ought to esteem only Clamours and Noise, raised by a Party to amuse and affright us; for pray let us enquire a little into them, and see if there be any Reason for us to be so terrified at them; suppose they were really what is alledged, which we hope they are not; <HI>for Example,</HI> the ab∣solute Dominion of the King of <HI>France</HI> over his Subjects, is such, say our People, as makes them Miserable; well, but let us examine then, are we not already miserable for Want of this Absolute Dominion? Are
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
we not miserably divided? Is not our Go∣vernment miserably weak? Are we not miserably subjected to the Rabbles and Mob? Nay, is not the very Crown mobb'd here every now and then, into whatever our Soveraign Lord the People demand? whereas on the contrary, we see <HI>France</HI> entirely united as one Man; no virulent Scriblers there dare Affront the Govern∣ment; no Impertinent P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ments there disturb the Monarch with their Addresses and Representations; no Superiority of Laws restrain the Administration; no In∣solent Lawyers talk of the Sacred Constitu∣tion, in Opposition to the more Sacred Pre∣rogative; but all with Harmony and Ge∣neral Consent agree to Support the Majesty of their Prince, and with their Lives and Fortunes; (not in Complimenting Sham Ad∣dresses only, but in Reality, and effectually) Support the Glory of their Great Monarch. In doing this they are all united together so firmly, as if they had but one Heart, and one Mind, and that the King was the Soul of the Nation: What if they are <HI>what we foolishly call</HI> Slaves to the Absolute Will of their Prince? That Slavery to them is meer Liberty; they entertain no Notions of that foolish Thing <HI>Liberty,</HI> which we make so much Noise about; nor have they any Oc∣casion of it, or any Use for it if they had
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
it; they are as Industrious in Trade, as Vigorous in Pursuit of their Affairs, go on with as much Courage, and are as well satis∣fied when they have wrought hard 20 or 30 Years to get a little Money for the King to take away, as we are to get it for our Wives and Children; and as they plant Vines, and plow Lands, that the King and his Great Men may eat the Fruit thereof, they think it as great a Felicity as if they Eat it themselves. The Badge of their Poverty, which we make such a Noise of, and Insult them about so much, (<HI>viz.</HI>) their Wooden Shoes, their Peasants make nothing of it; they say they are as happy in their Wooden Shoes, as our People are with their Luxury and Drunkenness; besides, do not our Poor People wear Iron Shoes, and Leather Doublets, and where is the Odds between them? All the Business forsooth is this Trifle we call Liberty, which rather than be plagued with so much Strife and Dissen∣tion about it as we are, who would be troubled with? Now it is evident <HI>the Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> which we should enjoy under the like Methods of Government here, which we hope for under the Happy Government of the Pretender, must needs be a full Equivalent for all the pretended Rights and Priviledges which we say we shall loose; and how will our Rights and
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Privileges be lost? Will they not rather be Centred in our Common Receptacle, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Sovereign, who is according to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s happy Govern∣ment the Common Magazine of Universal Privilege, communicating it to, and pre∣serving it for, the general Use of his Subjects, as their Safety and Happiness requires. Thus he protects their Commerce, encourages their Foreign Settlements, en∣larges their Possessions Abroad, encreases their Manufactures, gives them Room for spreading their numerous Race over the World; at Home he rewards Arts and Sci∣ences, cultivates Learning, employs innu∣merable Hands in the Labours of the State, and the like; what if it be true that all they Gain is at his Mercy? Does he take it away, except when needful, for the Sup∣port of his Glory and Grandeur, which is their Protection? Is it not apparent, that under all the Oppressions they talk so much of, the <HI>French</HI> are the Nation the most Im∣proved and Encreased in Manufactures, in Navigation, in Commerce, within these 50 Years, of any Nation in the World? And here we pretend Liberty, Property, Consti∣tutions, Rights of Subjects, and such Stuff as that, and with all these fine Gewgaws, which we pretend propagate Trade, and
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
encrease the Wealth of the Nation, we are every Day Declining, and become Poor; how long will this Nation be blinded by their own foolish Customs? And when will they learn to know, that the Absolute Go∣vernment of a Vertuous Prince, who makes the Good of his People his Ultimate End, and esteems their Prosperity his Glory, is the Best, and most Godlike, Government in the World.</P>
<P>Let us then be no more rendred uneasie with the Notions, that with the Pretender we must entertain <HI>French</HI> Methods of Go∣vernment, such as Tyranny and Arbitrary Power; Tyranny is no more Tyranny, when improv'd for the Subjects Advantage; perhaps when we have tried it we may find it as much for our Good many Ways, nay, and more too, than our present Exor∣bitant Liberties, especially unless we can make a better Use of them, and Enjoy them, without being always going by the Ears about them, as we see daily, not only with our Governours, but even with one ano∣ther; a little <HI>French Slavery,</HI> though it be a frightful Word among us, <HI>that is,</HI> being made so by Custom, yet may do us a great deal of Good in the Main, as it may teach us not to <HI>Over</HI> (Under) <HI>Value</HI> our Liber∣ties, when we have them, so much as some∣times we have done; and this is not one of
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
the least Advantages which we shall gain by the Coming of the Pretender, and conse∣quently one of the good Reasons why we should be very willing to receive him.</P>
<P>The next Thing which they fill us with Apprehensions of in the Coming of the Pretender, is the Influence of <HI>French</HI> Coun∣cils, which they Construe thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Pretender being restor'd here by the Assistance of <HI>France,</HI> will not only Rule us by <HI>French</HI> Methods, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by <HI>French</HI> Tyranny, but in Gratitude to his Restorer he will cause us to be always ready with <HI>English</HI> Blood and Treasure to Assist and Support the <HI>French</HI> Ambition in the Invasi∣ons he will ever be making upon <HI>Europe,</HI> and in the Oppressions of other Nations; till at last he obtain the Superiority over them all, and turn upon us too, devouring the Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> in his so long pur∣posed and resolved <HI>Universal Monarchy.</HI> As to the Gratitude of the Pretender to the King of <HI>France,</HI> why should you make that a Crime? Are not all People bound in Ho∣nour to retaliate Kindness? And would you have your Prince be ungrateful to him that brought him hither? By the same Rule you would expect he could be ungrateful to us that receive him; besides, if it be so great an Advantage to us to have him brought in, we shall be all concern'd also in Gratitude
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
to the King of <HI>France</HI> for helping us to him; and sure we shall not decline making a suitable Return to him for the Kindness; and is this any Thing more than common? Did we not pay the <HI>Dutch</HI> Six Hundred Thousand Pound <HI>Sterling</HI> for assisting the Late King <HI>William?</HI> And did we not imme∣diately Embark with them in the War against the King of <HI>France?</HI> And has not that Revolution cost the Nation One Hundred Millions of <HI>British</HI> Money to Support it? And shall we grutch to Support the Pre∣tender, and his Benefactor, at the same Expence, if it should be needful, for carry∣ing on the New Scheme of <HI>French</HI> Li∣berty, which when that Time comes may be in a likely and forward Way to prevail over the whole World, to the General Hap∣piness of <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P>There seems to be but one Thing more which those People, who make such a Cla∣mour at the Fears of the Pretender, take hold of, and this is Religion; and they tell us, that not only <HI>French</HI> Government, and <HI>French</HI> Influence, but <HI>French</HI> Religion, that is to say, <HI>Popery,</HI> will come upon us; but these People know not what they talk of, for it is evident that they shall be so far from being loaden with Religion, that they will rather obtain that so long desired Hap∣piness, of having no Religion at all. This
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
we may easily make appear has been the Advantage which has been long labour'd for in this Nation; and as the Attainments we are arriv'd to of that Kind are very considerable already, so we cannot doubt but that if once the Pretender were settled quietly among us, an Absolute Subjection, as well of Religious Principles, as Civil Li∣berties, to the Disposal of the Sovereign, would take Place. This is an Advantage so fruitful of several other manifest Improve∣ments, that though we have not Room in this Place to enlarge upon the Particulars, we cannot doubt but it must be a most grate∣ful Piece of News to a great Part of the Nation, who have long groan'd under the Oppressions and cruel Severities of the Clergy, occasion'd by their own strict Lives, and rigorous Virtue, and their imposing such Austerities and Restraints upon the People; and in this Particular the Cla∣mour of Slavery will appear very scanda∣lous in the Nation, for the Slavery of Religion being taken off, and an Universal Freedom of Vice being introduced, what greater Liberty can we enjoy.</P>
<P>But we have yet greater Advantages at∣tending this Nation by the Coming of the Pretender than any we have yet taken No∣tice of; and though we have not Room in
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
this short Tract to name them all, and en∣large upon them as the Case may require, yet we cannot omit such due Notice of them, as may serve to satisfie our Readers, and convince them, how much they ought to favour the Coming of the Pretender, as the great Benefit to the whole Nation; and therefore we shall begin with our Brethren of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and here we may tell them, that they, of all the Parts of this Island, shall receive the most evident Advantages, in that the setting the Pretender upon the Throne shall effectually set them free from the Bondage they now groan under, in their abhorr'd Subjection to <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Union, which</HI> may, no question, be de∣clar'd Void, and Dissolv'd, as a Violence upon the <HI>Scottish</HI> Nation, as soon as ever the Pretender shall be Established upon the Throne; a few Words may serve to recom∣mend this to the <HI>Scots,</HI> since we are very well satisfied we shall be sure to oblige every Side there, by it: The Opposition all Sides made to the Union at the Time of the Transaction of the Union in the Parliament there, cannot but give us Reason to think thus; and the present Scruple, even the Presbyterians themselves make, of taking the Abjuration, if they do not, as some pretend, assure us that the said Presbyterian Non∣jurers are in the Interest of the Pretender,
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
yet they undeniably prove, and put it out of all question, that they are ill-pleased with the Yoke of the Union, and would embrace every just Occasion of being qui∣etly and freely discharged from the Fetters which they believe they bear by the said Union; now there is no Doubt to be made, but that upon the very first Appear∣ance of the Pretender, the Antient King∣dom of <HI>Scotland</HI> should recover her former well-known Condition, we mean, of being perfectly free, and depending upon none but the King of <HI>France. How</HI> Inestimable an Advantage this will be to <HI>Scotland</HI> and how effectually he will Support and Defend the <HI>Scots</HI> against their Antient Enemies, the <HI>English,</HI> forasmuch as we have not Room to enlarge upon here, we may take Occasion to make out more particularly on another Occasion. But it may not be for∣gotten here, that the Union was not only justly Distasteful to the <HI>Scots</HI> them∣selves, but also to many Good Men, and Noble Patriots of the Church, some of whom entred their Protests against Passing and Confirming, or Ratifying the same, such as the late Lord <HI>Hav<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>sham,</HI> and the Right Wise, and Right Noble, E<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> of <HI>Nott<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>,</HI> whose Reasons for being against the said <HI>Union, besides those they gave in the House of P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>, which we do by</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
<HI>no Means mean or reflect upon in the least in this Place</HI>; we say, whose other Reasons for opposing the said Union were found∣ed upon an Implacable Hatred to the <HI>Scots</HI> Kirk, which has been Established thereby: It may then not admit of any Question, but that they would think it a very great Advantage to be delivered from the same, as they would effectually be by the Coming of the Pretender; wherefore by the con∣curring Judgment of these Noble and Wise Persons who on that Account opposed the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> the Coming of the Pretender must be an Inexpressible Advantage to this Nation; nor is the dissolving the Union so desirable a Thing, meerly as that Union was an Establishing among us a Wicked Schis∣matical Presbyterian Generation, and giving the Sanction of the Laws to their Odious Constitution, which we Esteem (you know) worse than Popery; but even on Civil Accounts, as particularly on Account of the P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who many of them think themselves Egregiously maltrea∣ted, and robb'd of their Birthright, as P<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s, and have express'd themselves so in a something Publick Manner. Now we cannot think that any of these will be at all offended that all this New Establish∣ment should be revoked; nay, we have heard it openly said, that the <HI>Scots</HI> are
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
so little satisfied with the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> at this Time, that if it were now to be put to the Vote, as it was before, whether they should Unite with <HI>England,</HI> or no, there would not be one Man in Fifteen, through∣out <HI>Scotland,</HI> that would Vote for it. <HI>If then</HI> it appears that the whole Nation thus seems to be averse to the Union, and by the Coming in of this most Glorious Pre∣tender that Union will be in all Appear∣ance dissolved, and the Nation freed from the Encumbrance of it, will any <HI>Scots</HI> Man, who is against the Union, refuse to be for the Pretender? Sure it cannot be; I know it is alledged, that they will lay aside their Discontent at the Union, and Unite together against the Pretender, be∣cause that is to Unite against Popery; we will not say what a few, who have their Eyes in their Heads, may do; but as the Generality of the People there are not so well reconciled together, as such a Thing requires, it is not unlikely that such a Uniting may be prevented, if the Pretender's Friends there can but play the Game of di∣viding them farther, as they should do; to which End it cannot but be very serviceable to them to have the real Advantages of re∣ceiving the Pretender laid before them, which is the true Intent and Meaning of the Present Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
But we have more and greater Advan∣tages of the Coming of the Pretender, and such as no question will invite you to receive him with great Satisfaction and Ap∣plause; and it cannot be unnecessary to inform you, for your Direction in other Cases, how the Matter, as to Real and Imaginary Advantage, stands with the Na∣tion in this Affair; and <HI>First,</HI> The Coming of the Pretender will at once put us all out of Debt. These Abomination-Whigs, and these Bloody Wars, carried on so long for little or nothing, <HI>have,</HI> as is evident to our Senses <HI>now,</HI> (whatever it was all along,) brought a heavy Debt upon the Nation; so that if what a known Author lately Published is true, the Government pays now almost Six Millions a Year to the Common People for Interest of Money; that is to say, the Usurers Eat up the Na∣tion, and Devour Six Millions Yearly; which is paid, and must be paid now for a long Time, if some <HI>kind Turn,</HI> such as this of the Coming of the Pretender, or such like, does not help us out of it; the Weight of this is not only Great, insuperably Great, but most of it is entailed for a terrible Time, not only for our Age, but beyond the Age of our Grand-children, even for Ninety-nine Years: By how much the Con∣sideration of this Debt is Intolerable and
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
Afflicting to the last Degree, by so much the greater must the Obligation be to the Person, who will Ease the Nation of such a Burthen, and therefore we place it among the Principal Advantages which we are to receive from the Admission of the Preten∣der, that he will not fail to rid us of this Grievance, and by Methods peculiar to himself, deliver us from so great a Burthen as these Debts are now, and, unless he de∣liver us, are like to be to the Ages to come: Whither he will do this at once, by remitting most Graciously to the Na∣tion the whole Payment, and consequently take off the Burthen, <HI>Brevi Manu,</HI> as with a Spunge wiping out the Infamous Score, leaving it to fall as Fate directs, or by pru∣dent Degrees, we know not, nor is it our Business to determine it here; no Doubt the doing it with a Jerk, as we call it, <HI>Comme une Coup de Grace,</HI> must be the most expe∣ditious Way; nay, and the kindest Way of putting the Nation out of its Pain; for lingering Deaths are counted cruel; and tho' <HI>Ʋne coup d'Eclat</HI> may make an Impres∣sion for the Present, yet the Astonishment is soonest over; besides, where is the Loss to the Nation in this Sense? Tho' the Money be stopt from the Subject on one Hand, if it be stopt to the Subjects on the other, the Nation Loses or Gains Nothing; we
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
know if will be Answer'd, that it is unjust, and that Thousands of Families will be ruin'd, because they who Loose, will not be those who Gain. But what is this to the Purpose in a National Revolution; unjust! Alas! Is that an Argument? Go and ask the Pretender! Does not he say you have all done unjustly by him? And since the Na∣tion in general loses Nothing, what Obli∣gation has he to regard the particular In∣jury that some Families may sustain? And yet farther, is it not remarkable, that most Part of the Money is paid by the Cursed Party of Whigs, who from the Beginning officiously appear'd to keep him from his Right? And what Obligation has he upon him to concern himself for doing them Right in Particular, more than other Peo∣ple? But to avoid the Scandal of Partia∣lity, there is another Thought offers to our View, which the Nation is beholding to a Particular Author for putting us in Mind of; if it be unjust that we should suppose the Pretender shall stop the Pay∣ment on both Sides, because it is doing the Whigs Wrong, since the Tories, who per∣haps being chiefly Landed Men, pay the most Taxes; then, to keep up a just Bal∣lance, he need only continue the Taxes to be paid in, and only stop the Annuities and Interest which are to be paid out.
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Thus both Sides having no Reason to Envy or Reproach one another with Hardships, or with suffering Unequally; they may eve∣ry one lose their Proportion, and the Mo∣ney may be laid up in the Hands of the New Sovereign, for the Good of the Na∣tion.</P>
<P>This being thus happily proposed, we cannot pass over the great Advantages which would accrue to this Nation in such a Case, by having such a Mass of Money laid up in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> at the Absolute Command of a most Gracious <HI>French</HI> So∣vereign. But as these Things are so Glo∣rious, and so Great, as to admit of no compleat Explication in this short Tract, give us Leave, <HI>O People</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to lay before you a little Scetch of your future Felicity, under the Auspicious Reign of such a Glorious Prince, as we all hope, and believe, the Pretender to be. (1.) You are to allow, that by such a Just and Righ∣teous shutting up of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> in about Seven Years Time, he may be supposed to have received about Forty Millions Sterling from his People, which not being to be found in <HI>Specie</HI> in the Kingdom, will, for the Benefit of Circulation, enable him to Treasure up Infinite Funds of Wealth in Foreign Banks, a prodigious Mass of Foreign Bullion, Gold, Jewels, and
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Plate, to be ready in the <HI>Tower,</HI> or else∣where, to be issued upon Future Emer∣gency, as Occasion may allow. This pro∣digious Wealth will necessarily have these happy Events, to the Infinite Satisfaction and Advantage of the whole Nation, and the Benefit of which I hope none will be so Unjust, or Ungrateful, to deny. (1.) It will for ever after deliver this Nation from the Burthen, the Expence, the Formality, and the Tyranny, of Parliaments. No one can perhaps at the first View be rightly sensible of the many Advantages of this Article, and from how many Mischiefs it will deliver this Nation. (1.) How the Countrey Gentlemen will be no longer har∣rass'd to come, at the Command of every Court Occasion, and upon every Summons by the Prince's Proclamation, from their Families, and other Occasions, whether they can be spared from their Wives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or no, or whether they can trust their Wives be∣hind them, or no; nay, whether they can spare Money or no for the Journey, or whether they must come <HI>Carriage Paid</HI> or no; <HI>then</HI> they will no more be unnecessa∣rily exposed to Long and Hazardous Jour∣neys, in the Depth of Winter, from the remotest Corners of the Island, to come to <HI>London,</HI> just to give away the Countrey's Money, and go Home again; all this will
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
be dispenced with by the Kind and Graci∣ous Management of the Pretender, when he, <HI>God bless us,</HI> shall be our more Gra∣cious Sovereign. (2.) In the happy Con∣sequence of the Demise of Parliaments, the Countrey will be eased of that intolerable Burthen of Travelling to Elections, some∣times in the Depth of Winter, sometimes in the Middle of their Harvest, whenever the Writs of Elections Arbitrarily Sum∣mons them. (3.) And with them the Poor Gentlemen will be eased of that abominable Grievance of the Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Expence of Elections, by which so many Gentlemen of Estates have been Ruin'd, so many innocent People, of ho∣nest Principles before, have been De∣bauched, and made Mercenary, Partial, Perjur'd, and been Blinded with Bribes, to Sell their Countrey and Liberties to who bids most. It is well known how often, and yet how in vain, this Distem∣per has been the constant Concern of Par∣liaments, for many Ages, to Cure, and to provide sufficient Remedies for. Now if ever the effectual Remedy for this is found out, to the inexpressible Advantage of the whole Nation; and this perhaps is the only Cure for it that the Nature of the Disease will admit of; what terrible Ha∣vock has this kind of Trade made among
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
the Estates of the Gentry, and the Morals of the Common People? (4.) How also has it kept alive the Factions and Divi∣sions of the Countrey People, keeping them in a Constant Agitation, and in Tri∣ennial Commotions? So that what with Forming New Interests, and Cultivating Old, the Heats and Animosities never cease among the People. But once set the Pre∣tender upon the Throne, and let the Funds be but happily stopt, and paid into his Hands, that he may be in no more Need of a Parliament, and all these Distempers will be cur'd as effectually as a Feaver is cur'd by cutting off the Head, or as a Hal∣ter cures the Bleeding at the Nose. How Infatuated then is this Nation, that they should so obstinately refuse a Prince, by the Nature of whose Circumstances, and the avowed Principles of whose Party, we are sure to obtain such Glorious Things, such Inestimable Advantages, Things which no Age, no Prince, no Attempt of Parties, or Endeavour, though often aim'd at of Ministers of State, have ever been able to procure for us. (2.) This Amas∣sing of Treasure, by the stopping the Funds on one Hand, and the receiving the Taxes on the other, will effectually enable the Pretender to set up, and effectually main∣tain, that Glorious, and so often-desir'd, Me∣thod
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
of Government, <HI>Au Coup de Cannon, Anglice,</HI> a Standing Army. This we have the Authority of the Antient Borough of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> that it is the Safety of the Prince, and the Glory of the Nation, as appears by their Renowned Address to King <HI>James</HI> II. Then we should see a new Face of our Na∣tion, and <HI>Britain</HI> would no more be a na∣ked Nation, as it has formerly been; then we should have Numerous and Gallant Ar∣mies surrounding a Martial Prince, ready to make the World, as well as his own Subjects, tremble; then our Inland Coun∣ties would appear full of Royal Fortifica∣tions, Citadels, Forts, and Strong Towns; the Beauty of the Kingdom, and Awe of Factious Rebels: It is a strange Thing that this Refractory People of ours could never be made sensible how much it is for the Glory and Safety of this Nation that we should be put into a Posture of De∣fence <HI>against ourselves:</HI> It has been often alledged, that <HI>this Nation can never be ruin'd but with their own Consent:</HI> If then we are our own Enemies, is it not highly requisite that we should be put in a Condi∣tion to have our Ruin prevented? And that since it is apparent we are no more fit to be trusted with our own Liberties, having a Natural and a National Propensity to de∣stroy and undo ourselves, and may be
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
brought to Consent to our own Ruin, we should have such Princes as for the future know how to restrain us, and how reason∣able is it to allow them Forces <HI>to do so?</HI></P>
<P>We might enlarge here upon the Great and Certain Advantages of this best of Go∣vernments, <HI>a Standing Army</HI>; we might go back to the <HI>Persian, Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Empires, which had never arriv'd to such a Pitch of Glory if the People and Nati∣ons who they subdued had been able to Nose them with such Trifles as what we call Constitution, National Right, Antient Privileges, <HI>and the like</HI>; we might descend also to particular Advantages of Govern∣ment, which it is hoped we may attain to in <HI>Britain</HI> when the Pretender arrives, some of which are grown Obsolete, and out of Use, by Custom, and long Possession of those troublesome Things call'd Liber∣ties; among these may be reckoned,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The whole Kingdom will be at once eased of that ridiculous Feather-caps Expence of Militia and Train'd-bands, which serve for little else but to justifie the Picking the Peoples Pockets, with an An∣nual Tax of Trophy-Money, and every now and then putting the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Parts Adjacent, to Ten Thousand Pound Charge, to beat Drums, and shoot Muskets, for nothing; when on the con∣trary,
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
you shall in the Blessed Revolution we now invite you to have all this done <HI>Gratis,</HI> by the Standing Troops kept con∣stantly in Pay; and your Lieutenancy may lay down their Commissions among the rest of <HI>Non-Significants</HI> of the Nation.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) You shall be for ever out of Danger of being ridden again by the <HI>Mob,</HI> your Meeting-houses shall no more be the Sub∣ject of the enraged Rabbles; nor shall the <HI>Bank</HI> of <HI>England</HI> desire the Drums to beat at Midnight to raise a Guard for <HI>Grocer's-Hall</HI>; your new Monarch will suffer none to In∣sult or Plunder the City <HI>but himself</HI>; and as the City itself shall never want Soldiers, <HI>how should it, when the whole Kingdom shall become a Garrison?</HI> The Money in the <HI>Bank</HI> shall always be defended by a strong Guard, who shall, whenever there is any Danger of its being too safe, convey it, for its Emi∣nent Security, from <HI>Grocer</HI>'s<HI>-Alley</HI> to the <HI>Tower,</HI> or to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> where it shall not fail to be kept for the Advantage of the Publick.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Again, upon this happy Change we shall immediately be delivered from that most Infamous Practice of Stock-jobbing, of which so much has been said to so little Purpose; for the Funds being turned all into One General Stock, and the Prince be∣ing himself your Security, you may even
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
write upon all your Companies this Gene∣ral Phrase, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>No Transfer,</HI> as they do when the Books are shut up at the <HI>Bank,</HI> or <HI>East-India</HI> House; so as all the Rivers of Water are swallowed up in the Sea, as One Ocean, to which they are all tending, so all these petty Cheats will be Ingulph'd at once in the General Ocean of State Trick, and the <HI>Exchange-Alley-Men</HI> may justly be said to Buy the <HI>Bear-Skin</HI> ever after.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Then</HI> (which is a Blessing we fear we cannot hope for before) we may expect to be deliver'd from the Throng of Virulent and Contumatious Libels which now Infest our Streets; and the Libellers themselves being most exemplarily Punished, for a Terror to the rest, will not dare to affront the Government with Ballads and Balder∣dash; if an impudent Fellow dares lift up his Pen against the Authority and Power of his Prince, he shall instantly feel the Weight of that Power to crush him, which he ought before to have feared; and Pamphleteers shall then not be Whipped and Pillor'd, but Hang'd; and when Two or Three of them have suffered that Way, it is hoped those wholesome Severities may put an effectual stop to the Noise and Clamour they now make in the Nation; above all, the Hands of the Government will then be set free from the Fetters of Law; and it shall
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
not be always necessary for the Ministers of State to proceed by all the Forms of the Courts of Justice, in such Cases, by which the Scriblers of the Age pretend to stand it out against the Government, and put their own Construction upon their Libels. But when these happy Days arrive, Juries and Judges shall find and determine in these, and all other Cases, bring Verdicts, and give Sentence, as the Prince in his Royal Justice shall direct.</P>
<P>We might enter here upon a long List of other happy Circumstances we shall all ar∣rive to, and of great Advantages not here named, which the Coming in of the Preten∣der shall infallibly bring us to the Enjoy∣ment of, particularly in Matters of Religion, Civil Right, Property and Commerce, but the needful Brevity of this Tract will not admit of it; we shall only add one Thing more, which gives Weight to all the rest, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the Certainty of these Things, and of their being the Natural Consequen∣ces of the bringing in the Pretender, adds to the certain Felicity of that Reign. This Sums up the Happiness of the Pretender's Reign; we need not talk of Security, as the <HI>Review</HI> has done, and pretend he is not able to give us Security for the Performance of any Thing he promises; every Man that has any Sense of the Principles, Honour,
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
and Justice of the Pretender, his Zeal for the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Cause, his Gratitude to his Benefactor, the <HI>French</HI> King, and his Love to the Glory and Happiness of his Native Countrey, must rest satisfied of his punctually performing all these Great Things for us; to ask him Security, would be not to Af∣front him only, but to Affront the whole Nation; <HI>No Man can doubt him</HI>; the Nature of the Thing allows that he must do us all that Kindness; he cannot be true to his own Reason without it; wherefore this Treaty <HI>executes itself,</HI> and appears so rational to believe, that whoever doubts it may be supposed to doubt even the Veracity of <HI>James</HI> the Just.</P>
<P>What unaccountable Folly then must those People be Guilty of, who stand so much in the Way of their own and their Countrey's Happiness, as to oppose, or pretend to argue against, the receiving this Glorious Prince, and would be for having <HI>Dutch</HI> Men and Foreigners forsooth to come, and all under the Notion of their being <HI>PROTE∣STANTS?</HI> To avoid and detect which Fallacy, we shall in our next Essay enter into the Examina∣tion of the Religion and Orthodox Principles of the Person of the Pretender, and doubt not to make it out, for the Satisfaction of all Tender Consciences, that he is a true Protestant of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> Establish'd by Law, and that in very Natural Primitive Sense of that Phrase as it was used by His Royal Predecessor, of Famous and Pious Memory, <HI>Charles</HI> II.—and as such, no doubt, he will endeavour for the Recovery of the Crown, which Crown, if he obtains it, you see what Glori∣ous Things he may do for himself, and us.</P>
