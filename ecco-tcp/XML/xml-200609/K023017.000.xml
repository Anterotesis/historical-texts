<HEAD>A CLUE to the
COMEDY
OF THE
NON-JUROR,
With some Hints of Consequence
relating to that PLAY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. <HI>Rowe,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Entirely agree with
you, That there has
not of late appear'd
in Publick, a more
<HI>exquisite Piece of Sa∣tire,</HI>
than the Come∣dy
call'd the <HI>Non-juror;</HI>
or that better deserv'd the
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Distinction that was shown it, not
only by your Self, as His Majesty's
Laureat, but by all the Loyal Party in
general. I also agree with you, that
perhaps there never was a Piece of fine
<HI>Drama-Theological Satire,</HI> the true Scope
of which has been less understood. I
am at a Loss which to admire most,
the noble, free Spirit of our Friend the
Author; the insensibility of those whom
the Satire is <HI>really Aim'd at,</HI> or the igno∣rant
Rage of those <HI>dissaffected Jacobite
Wretches</HI> who cry out when they are not
hurt. You were pleas'd to desire me,
when we met last, to put upon Paper
the few Hints I dropt to you in Con∣versation
upon this Subject, and which,
I doubt not, are sufficient to make any
unprejudic'd Rēader of your and my
Opinion; namely,</P>
<P>That Dissaffection to the Govern∣ment
is the smallest Immorality which
is pointed at by this Play; and which
indeed is only introduced to hide a far
<HI>deeper Design,</HI> and far <HI>more useful Satire.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
In order to set this in it's true Light,
I will but barely <HI>point</HI> at the several Fi∣gures
of the Comedy, and make some
short Remarks upon their Attitudes,
without the Ill-manners of naming any
particular Person, but leaving the free
and impartial Reader to draw his own
Inferences. Two general Observations
only, are necessary to be premised, be∣cause
every common Judge is not so
sensible of them, as we who have been
Writers all our Lives.</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> is, That when we <HI>Rebuke
our Superiours,</HI> the Fable ought to be so
coucn'd, as to make the Criminal give
Judgment against himself before he is
aware: (an Art as ancient at least as the
Days of <HI>Nathan)</HI> But if the Scene of
Action be laid in a Subject not only
quite <HI>foreign,</HI> but seemingly <HI>opposite</HI> to
the principal Aim of the Satire, the
Address will be still the more refined;
because by this Method the Author in∣troduceth
<HI>Facts</HI> and <HI>Personages</HI> which the
guilty will be sure to Condemn; not
only from <HI>natural Equity,</HI> but <HI>natural
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Aversion.</HI> Thus, for Example, To en∣gage
a <HI>Tory</HI> to condemn a Piece of Ini∣quity
in the Abstract, one need only lay
the Scene among <HI>Whigs,</HI> and so on the
contrary. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> I would put
the Reader in mind that in Fables of
this Nature, it is usual to represent <HI>whole
Parties of Men by single Personages.</HI></P>
<P>This premised, let us observe the
principal Figure thar presents it self to
our View; I mean Dr. <HI>Wolf;</HI> whose
Character answers to <HI>Moliere</HI>'s <HI>Tartuffe,</HI>
who is known to have represented a
<HI>certain puritanical Bishop in France.</HI></P>
<P>We next are to take Notice, That
<HI>Wolf</HI> in the Stile of <HI>Ecclesiastical Allegory</HI>
constantly signifies the <HI>Presbyterian Party:</HI>
You know it is thus in the <HI>Hind</HI> and
<HI>Panther,</HI> and most other Pieces of Con∣troversial
Divinity or Poetry. So Dr.
<HI>Wolf</HI> is a <HI>Presbyterian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>expects for his Services in</HI>
Betraying the Church, <HI>great</HI> Ecclesiasti∣cal
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
Preferment, <HI>(as Sir</HI> John <HI>ex∣presseth
it)</HI><NOTE N="1" PLACE="marg">Nonju∣ror, pag. 18.</NOTE> an Office for Life,
which, on whatsoever Pretence of
Misbehaviour, no Civil Government
can deprive him of. <HI>This is Ironi∣cally
represented afterwards by the</HI>
See of Thetford. <HI>So, in short,
Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>is a Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Bishop has
wrote something about the <HI>Case of
Schism;</HI> and the <HI>Colonel</HI> tells his
Father, <HI>That he</HI><NOTE N="2" PLACE="marg">pag. 3.</NOTE> <HI>has read enough
of him in the</HI> Daily Courant.
What Bishop has publish'd in the
<HI>Daily Courant,</HI> is <HI>lippis et tonsoribus
notum.</HI></P>
<P>This Bishop protests great Zeal
for the <HI>Church,</HI> at the same Time
that he is betraying it: On which
the <HI>Colonel</HI> tells Sir <HI>John, Tho'</HI><NOTE N="3" PLACE="marg">pag. 3.</NOTE>
<HI>I have always honour'd your Concern
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
for the Church, I little thought it
was for a Church that is Establish'd
no where.</HI> (i. e.) <HI>No visible Church.</HI></P>
<P>This Bishop is mark'd with
another strong Characteristick,
managing a Dispute with <HI>Heartly</HI>
about <HI>the Nature of Prayer.</HI> That
it ought not to be <HI>Tedious;</HI><NOTE N="4" PLACE="marg">pag. 13.</NOTE>
<HI>outward Expression not so absolutely
necessary, since Heaven knew the
true Intention of the Heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">pag. 12.</NOTE> And
then he talks of his own <HI>Manual
of Devotions.</HI></P>
<P>This Bishop also pretends a
mighty Regard to <HI>tender Conscien∣ces.</HI>
He tell's <HI>Heartly,</HI> That we
<NOTE N="5" PLACE="marg">pag. 13.</NOTE><HI>ought to allure them to what is
Good by the gentlest, easiest Means
we can,</HI> nor give the least colour
of Offence to tender Consciences.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<HI>The</HI> Colonel <HI>here urges the</HI> Con∣stitution
<HI>against him, and the force
of the Laws; and desires him to
explain himself; to which this
Bishop Answers</HI><NOTE N="6" PLACE="marg">pag. 13</NOTE><HI>Sir,</HI> I shall not
explain my Self: But make your best
of what I've said—But Power
perhaps may change it's Hands, and
you e're long as little dare to speak
your mind, as I do; <HI>viz.</HI> That there
may come a Time when this Consti∣tution
you talk so much of, may be
overturned.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> is fully satisfy'd that
the <HI>Doctor</HI> is all this while a<NOTE N="7" PLACE="marg">pag. 18.</NOTE>
<HI>true stanch Member of the</HI> English
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> mark, that is,
such a Church as <HI>comprehends all
Sects and Parties whatsoever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="10"/>
But lest these Lines shou'd not
be strong enough, the Author
gives the finishing Stroke.</P>
<P>This Bishop is at last disco∣ver'd
to be a <HI>Jesuit</HI> in Disguise,
By whom? By one of his <HI>School-Boys</HI>
in whom he had distilled.
some of his <HI>Jesuitical Principles</HI>
And most remarkable it is what
the <HI>Colonel</HI> says on this Occasion.
That<NOTE N="8" PLACE="marg">pag. 47.</NOTE><HI>Charles</HI> begs <HI>he will not
insist upon the Discovery, 'till his
Circumstances will allow it:</HI> Almost
in the very Stile of some <HI>Letters</HI>
that passed, upon a parallel Oc∣casion,
between a <HI>Master of a
School,</HI> and a <HI>Reverend Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>At last <HI>Substantial Affadavits</HI>
are produced, to prove Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>
to have been Educated a <HI>Jesuit;</HI>
by which (as it is usual in Alle∣gorical
Writers) <HI>the close Conjun∣ction
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
of a Reverend</HI> Prelate <HI>and a
certain</HI> Jesuit, is most injuriously
and scandalously insinuated.</P>
<P>So here is a <HI>Prelate</HI> and a <HI>Jesuit</HI>
and his <HI>Gang,</HI> got into the Family
of Sir <HI>John!</HI> Let us next see
what they are to do there. Why,
they contrive the <HI>Ruin</HI> of his Fa∣mily,
and the <HI>disinheriting</HI> and
<HI>expulsion</HI> of his <HI>Children</HI> with so
great an Assurance of Success, that
the <HI>Doctor</HI> talks of Sir <HI>John</HI> in
this manner:<NOTE N="9" PLACE="marg">pag. 68.</NOTE><HI>Poor Man! he
knows not his own Weakness; he is
moulded into any Shape, if you but
gently stroke his Humour. I intend
to Morrow, to perswade him 'tis for
the Interest of our Cause it should be
so; and then I have him sure.</HI> Poor
Sir <HI>John</HI> indeed!</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
I must here put you in mind
of my second Observation, that
by the single Person of Dr. <HI>Wolf,</HI>
without any forced Construction,
may be understood a whole Sett
or Party of Men. To proceed
then,</P>
<P>The Play Opens with a Dis∣pute
between Sir <HI>John</HI> and his
<HI>Daughter,</HI> about the Formality of
<HI>Christening,</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI> is at it
again, <HI>(pag</HI> 63) being extremely
rejoyced that <HI>Heartly</HI> is <HI>Christ'ned</HI>
according to the <HI>Right Form.</HI>
There is also mention made of
<HI>Searching the Register,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Next we see Dr.</HI> Wolf <HI>insulting
Sir</HI> John'<HI>s</HI> Son <HI>and</HI> Daughter; <HI>he
breaks into the</HI> Daughter's <HI>Bed∣chamber
before she is quite</HI> Up;
<HI>and when</HI> she resents it, <HI>he tell's
her</HI><NOTE N="10" PLACE="marg">pag. 15.</NOTE> Compose your Transport,
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
Madam: I came by your <HI>Father's
Desire;</HI> for what I have done,
Madam, I had your <HI>Father's Au∣thority,</HI>
and shall leave him to an∣swer
you. <HI>The</HI> Daughter <HI>replies,</HI>
<NOTE N="11" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE>It is false, he gave you no
Authority to insult me: What is it
you presume upon? your Function!
does that exempt you from the Man∣ners
of a Gentleman?</P>
<P>At last his foul Behaviour pro∣vokes
the <HI>Son</HI> to that degree, that
he call's him<NOTE N="12" PLACE="marg">pag. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Villain,</HI> and
<HI>Rascal.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir</HI> John <HI>is nettled at this; he
tells his</HI> Son <HI>and</HI> Daughter,<NOTE N="13" PLACE="marg">pag. 44.</NOTE>
I see your Aim: Your Malice on
your own vile Head: To me it
but the more endears him: Either
submit and <HI>ask his Pardon</HI> for this
Wrong,—or this Instant <HI>leave
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
my Sight,</HI> my <HI>House,</HI> my <HI>Family</HI>
for ever.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Son <HI>answers,</HI><NOTE N="14" PLACE="marg">pag. 45.</NOTE> Tho' I
would hazard Life to save you from
the Ruin he misleads you to, could
Die to Reconcile my Duty to your
Favour; yet on the Terms that Vil∣lain
offers, 'tis Merit to refuse it.
I Glory in the Disgrace your Errors
give me.</P>
<P>In short, Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Attachment
to Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> was so great, that
there appear'd but small Hopes of
ever opening Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Eyes:
And remarkable is the Lamenta∣tion
of the <HI>Son</HI> upon that Occa∣sion;<NOTE N="15" PLACE="marg">pag. 16.</NOTE>
<HI>What horrid Hands is
this poor Family fall'n into? How
little is my Father like himself, by
Nature Open, Just, and Generous?
but this vile Hypocrite drives his
weak Passions like the Wind; and I
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
foresee, at last, will dash him on his
Ruin.</HI></P>
<P>When Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> had wrought
up the Passion of Sir <HI>John</HI> to this
degree, as to turn his <HI>Children out
of Doors;</HI> then he interposeth his
good Offices, and proposeth a
<HI>Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>I beg the Reader to observe
the <HI>Terms</HI> of it. <HI>That his Child
should be at the sole Disposal of Dr.</HI>
Wolf, and do nothing without
<HI>his Consent.</HI></P>
<P>It must here be observ'd that
the Daughter had a Fortune of <HI>her
own, independent on the Father,</HI> upon
which she seems to value her Self.
<NOTE N="17" PLACE="marg">pag. 5.</NOTE><HI>Have not I</HI> 5000l. <HI>in my own
hands? have not I had the full Swing
of my own Airs and humours these
four years?</HI> Mark the precise
time But she is put in mind by
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
the <HI>Son,</HI> that tho' the Father
could not <HI>deprive her of her Fortune,
he might abridge</HI> her Equipage; in
these words<NOTE N="18" PLACE="marg">Ibid.</NOTE><HI>however a Father's
Consent might have clapt a pair of
horses more to your Coach.</HI></P>
<P>But at last he applauds her re∣solution,
and tells her she <HI>speaks
with the Spirit of a free-born English∣man.</HI></P>
<P>Mark now the modesty of
Dr. <HI>Wolf;</HI> he proposes, as the
Lowest and <HI>last condition, that she
should resign the half of this indepen∣dent
fortune</HI><NOTE N="19" PLACE="marg">pag. 54.</NOTE><HI>Is not two thousand
pounds worth two Thousand pounds?</HI>
Is not <HI>half</HI> better than <HI>nothing?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17"/>
Observe next, (good Mr.
<HI>Rowe)</HI> how Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> endea∣vours
to debauch Lady <HI>Woodvill,</HI>
and make her Subservient to his
Villainous designs: This Lady
is described as having a great As∣cendant
over Sir <HI>John's</HI> Spirit that
<HI>She keeps no Assemblys;</HI> that she
had been <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Beautiful,</HI> while
Sir <HI>John</HI> was <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Amourous.</HI>
This Lady proves honest and
trusty; and contributes, in the
conclusion, to the discovery of
the wicked purposes of Dr.
<HI>Wolf.</HI></P>
<P>Pray take notice too of a very
odd Episode that seem to contri∣bute
very little to the main
Action. That is Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>'s en∣deavouring
to Bring Sir <HI>John</HI> in∣to
a <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Church Comprehensi∣on;</HI>
Referring again to his <HI>Case of
Schism,</HI> he tells Sir <HI>John</HI> that<NOTE N="20" PLACE="marg">pag. 25</NOTE>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<HI>differences are not so material as
some would represent them. Ah!
could we be brought to a Temper,
a great many seeming Contradictions
might be reconciled.</HI> I allow this is a
<HI>Comprehension</HI> of a different kind;
but I beg leave to remind you
and my Readers of my first obser∣vation,
that the <HI>Circumstances of a
Fable</HI> do not determine the <HI>Satire.</HI>
But you, Sir, who are intimate
with Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> may examine and
know the Truth of this.</P>
<P>Nothing is so plain as the
Catastrophe; when Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI>
thought himself sure of his Blow,
and had brought Sir <HI>John</HI> to be∣lieve
that his<NOTE N="21" PLACE="marg">pag. 24.</NOTE><HI>hot brain'd</HI> Son
(as he calls him) had a Design to
get his Estate; he instantly makes
Sir <HI>John</HI> resolve to repay it in kind
by disinheriting him.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19"/>
But at last, there arises a
misfortune from a Corner where
the <HI>Doctor</HI> least suspected it.
Some of his own Party, whom
he thought inviolably attach'd to
his interests, discover his wicked
purposes. This Sett of Men is
represented by <HI>Charles</HI> an ingeni∣ous
Gentleman, a Servant of Sir
<HI>John</HI>'s, a man of Business, a good
<HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Scholar &amp;c.
This <HI>Charles</HI> (it seems) highly
obliged by the Generous treat∣ment
of the <HI>Son</HI> and enamour'd
of the good Qualities of the
<HI>Daughter,</HI> both reveals, and pre∣vents
the whole <HI>mystery of Iniquity:</HI>
Upon which Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> seeing his
project dissappointed vents his
Rage upon this honest Gentleman;
and attempts his Life.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20"/>
Lastly, Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> (to obviate
all possibility of mistaking his
meaning) upon the winding up
of the whole design, breaks on a
sudden into an open discourse of
<HI>Politicks;</HI> talks of <HI>embroiling the
Nation,</HI> and <HI>ending Publick disputes</HI>
and calls upon King <HI>George,</HI> with
abundance more good <HI>Morality</HI>
very well worth observing.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, according to your
desire, I have given a short Sketch
of the <HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Characters</HI> of this
Play; just enough to enable some
person of greater <HI>Sagacity</HI> to find
out who are meant by every par∣ticular
Personage of the <HI>Drama.</HI>
I am sure I would not presume
so much as to guess.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="21"/>
But one Thing I must observe,
which I remember we both took
particular notice of: It is, that
the Author tho' questionless a great
master of Stile puts <HI>bad English</HI> into
the mouths of most of his Per∣sonages:
So that indeed scarce any
of e'm talk at all like <HI>English Folks;</HI>
but perpetually make use of an
uncorrect, <HI>Foreign, Jargon.</HI> What
his drift is in this I cannot ima∣gine;
but the Instances of it are
obvious to every Reader; and
numerous <HI>in every Page.</HI></P>
