<L>Nothing a Princes Wisdom more displays,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>But we'll no more pursue the mighty Train,</L>
<L>Whom to describe our Verse attempts in vain;</L>
<L>The Muses vail before the Illustrious Throng,</L>
<L>Too bright for Verse, too num'rous for our Song;</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="52"/>
Our Ancestors had merited in vain,</L>
<L>If our new steps did not their old maintain:</L>
<L>But as our Modern Virtue stands as high,</L>
<L>The present Worthies do the past supply;</L>
<L><HI>A</HI> certain Pledge, our Name shall never dy.</L>

<L>Nor will their Virtue be exhausted here,</L>

<L>Blest Mixture, equally Devout and Gay,</L>
<L>For Virtue only can both smile and pray.</L>

<L>No Scale of calculated Right will ly</L>

<L><HI>England</HI> indeed the larger Roll may claim,</L>

<LG>
<L>And now to Wonders turn your listning Ear,</L>
<L>Visit the Commonwealth of Learning here;</L>
<L>See how <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Nurs'ry thrives, and how</L>
<L><HI>Wit blooms</HI> in spight of Climat, Storms and Snow;</L>
<L>The Muses all laborious and severe,</L>

<L>Here <HI>Epicks</HI> thick, as Groves of Laurel grow,</L>

<L>And ev'ry day <HI>'tis weeded</HI> of Conceit,</L>
<L>Kept thin, intrench'd, and never runs to seed,</L>
<L>But ripens gently in its flowry Bed;</L>
<L>For Wit's a Plant so apt to grow in haste,</L>
<L>It shakes the Root, and then decays as fast.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="54"/>
<HI>Strong Sciences</HI> in pleasing Order stand,</L>
<L>With Borders of Philosophy on either hand.</L>
<L>These well reward the Lab'rers constant Toil,</L>

<L>But above all the Wonders of the Spot,</L>

<L>How do the easy World appear content</L>

<L>Another Plant, <HI>but ah!</HI> how faint it grows?</L>
<L>Not that 'tis hurt by <HI>Climate, Frost,</HI> and <HI>Snows;</HI></L>
