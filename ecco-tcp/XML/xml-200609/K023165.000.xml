<HEAD>AN
EPISTLE
To the Right Honorable
<HI>ALLEN</HI> Lord <HI>BATHURST.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHO shall decide, when Doctors dis-agree,</L>
<L>And soundest Casuists doubt, like you
and me?</L>
<L>You hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</L>
<L>That Man was made the standing Jest of Heav'n,</L>
<L>And Gold but sent to keep the Fools in play,</L>
<L>For half to heap, and half to throw away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>
<L>But I, who think more highly of our Kind,</L>
<L>(And surely Heav'n and I are of a mind)</L>
<L>Opine, that Nature, as in duty bound,</L>
<L>Deep hid the shining Mischief under ground:</L>
<L>But when, by Man's audacious Labor won,</L>
<L>Flam'd forth this Rival to its Sire the Sun,</L>
<L>Then, in plain prose, were made two sorts of men,</L>
<L>To squander some, and some to hide agen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like Doctors thus, when much Dispute has past,</L>
<L>We find our Tenets just the same at last:</L>
<L>Both fairly owning Riches in effect</L>
<L>No Grace of Heav'n, or Token of th' Elect;</L>
<L>Giv'n to the Fool, the Mad, the Vain, the Evil,</L>
<L>To W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rd, to W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>t<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rs, Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>rs, and the Devil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Nature wants, commodious Gold bestows,</L>
<L>'Tis thus we eat the bread another sows:</L>
<L>But how unequal it bestows, observe,</L>
<L>'Tis thus we riot, while who sow it, starve.</L>
<L>What Nature wants (a phrase I much distrust)</L>
<L>Extends to Luxury, extends to Lust;</L>
<L>And if we count among the Needs of life</L>
<L>Another's Toil, why not another's Wife?</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Useful, we grant, it serves what life requires,</L>
<L>But dreadful too, the dark Assassin hires:</L>
<L>Trade it may help, Society extend;</L>
<L>But lures the Pyrate, and corrupts the Friend:</L>
<L>It raises Armies in a nation's aid,</L>
<L>But bribes a Senate, and the Land's betray'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! that such Bulky bribes as all might <HI>see</HI></L>
<L>Still, as of old, encumber'd Villainy!</L>
<L>In vain may Heroes fight, and Patriots rave,</L>
<L>If secret Gold saps on from knave to knave.</L>
<L>Could France or Rome divert our brave designs,</L>
<L>With all their brandies, or with all their wines?</L>
<L>What could they more than knights and squires con∣found,</L>
<L>Or water all the Quorum ten miles round?</L>
<L>A statesman's slumbers how this speech would spoil,</L>
<L>" Sir, Spain has sent a thousand jars of oyl;</L>
<L>" Huge bales of British cloth blockade the door;</L>
<L>" A hundred Oxen at your levee roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor Avarice one torment more would find,</L>
<L>Nor could Profusion squander all, in kind.</L>
<L>Astride his Cheese Sir Morgan might we meet,</L>
<L>And Worldly crying Coals from street to street,</L>

<L>With spurning heels and with a butting head;</L>
<L>To White's be carry'd, as to ancient Games,</L>
<L>Fair Coursers, Vases, and alluring Dames.</L>
<L>Shall then Uxorio, if the stakes he sweep,</L>
<L>Bear home six Whores, and make his Lady weep?</L>
<L>Or soft Adonis, so perfum'd and fine,</L>
<L>Drive to St. James's a whole herd of Swine?</L>

Gold, imp'd with this, may compass hardest things,</L>

<L>Like a tall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bully, lifts the head, and lyes:</L>
<L>There dwelt a Citizen of sober fame,</L>
<L>A plain good man, and Balaam was his name.</L>
<L>Religious, punctual, frugal, and so forth—</L>
<L>His word would pass for more than he was worth.</L>
<L>One solid dish his week-day meal affords,</L>

Constant at Church, and Change; his gains were sure,</L>
<L>His givings rare, save farthings to the poor.</L>

<L>The Dev'l was piqu'd, such saintship to behold,</L>
<L>And long'd to tempt him like good Job of old:</L>
<L>But Satan now is wiser than of yore,</L>
<L>And tempts by making rich, not making poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rouz'd by the Prince of Air, the whirlwinds sweep</L>
<L>The surge, and plunge his Father in the deep;</L>
<L>Then full against his Cornish lands they roar,</L>
<L>And two rich Ship-wrecks bless the lucky shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks,</L>
<L>He takes his chirping pint, he cracks his jokes:</L>
<L>" Live like your self," was soon my Lady's word;</L>
<L>And lo! two puddings smok'd upon the board.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Asleep and naked as an Indian lay,</L>
<L>An honest Factor stole a Gem away:</L>
<L>He pledg'd it to the Knight; the Knight had wit,</L>
<L>So kept the Diamond, and the Rogue was bit:</L>
<L>Some Scruple rose, but thus he eas'd his thought,</L>
<L>" I'll now give six-pence where I gave a groat,</L>
<L>" Where once I went to church, I'll now go twice,</L>
<L>" And am so clear too, of all other Vice."</L>

<L>The Tempter saw his time; the work he ply'd,</L>
<L>Stocks and Subscriptions pour on ev'ry side;</L>
<L>And all the Daemon makes his full descent,</L>
<L>In one abundant Show'r of <HI>Cent. per Cent.</HI></L>
<L>Sinks deep within him and possesses whole,</L>
<L>Then dubs <HI>Director</HI> and secures his Soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold Sir Balaam now a man of spirit,</L>
<L>Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit,</L>
<L>What late he call'd a Blessing, now was Wit,</L>
<L>And God's good providence, a lucky Hit.</L>
<L>Things change their titles as our manners turn,</L>
<L>His Compting-house imploy'd the Sunday-morn;</L>
<L>Seldom at church, ('twas such a busy life)</L>
<L>But duly sent his family and wife.</L>
<L>There (so the Dev'l ordain'd) one Christmas-tide,</L>
<L>My good old Lady catch'd a cold, and dy'd.</L>

<L>A Nymph of Quality admires our Knight;</L>
<L>He marries, bows at Court, and grows polite:</L>
<L>Leaves the dull Cits, and joins (to please the fair)</L>
<L>The well-bred Cuckolds in St. James's air:</L>
<L>First, for his son a gay commission buys,</L>
<L>Who drinks, whores, fights, and in a duel dies.</L>

<L>My Lady falls to Play: so bad her chance,</L>

<L>The House impeach him; Co * *. by harangues,</L>
<L>The Court forsakes him, and Sir Balaam hangs:</L>
<L>Wife, son, and daughter, Satan! are thy prize,</L>
<L>And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies.</L>
