<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ABelard</HI> and <HI>Eloisa</HI> flourish'd in the twelsth Cen∣tury;
they were two of the most dislinguish'd
persons of their age in learning and beauty, but for no∣thing
more famous than for their unfortunate passon.
After a long course of calamities, they retired each to a
several Convent, and consecrated the remainder of their
days to religion. It was many years after this sepa∣ration,
that a letter of <HI>Abelard</HI>'s to a friend, which
contain'd the history of his misfortunes, fell into the
hands of <HI>Eloisa.</HI> This awakening all her tenderness,
occasion'd those celebrated letters (out of which the fol∣lowing
is partly extracted) which give so lively a pi∣cture
of the struggles of grace and nature, virtue and
passion.</P>

<L>Oh write it not, my hand—The name appears</L>
<L>Already written—wash it out, my tears!</L>
<L>In vain lost <HI>Eloisa</HI> weeps and prays,</L>

<L>Heav'n claims me all in vain, while he has part,</L>

<L>Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,</L>
<L>That well-known name awakens all my woes.</L>
<L>O name for ever sad! for ever dear!</L>
<L>Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.</L>
<L>I tremble too where-e'er my own I find,</L>
<L>Some dire misfortune follows close behind.</L>
<L>Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,</L>
<L>Led thro' a sad variety of woe:</L>
<L>Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom,</L>
<L>Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!</L>
<L>There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,</L>
<L>There dy'd the best of passions, Love and Fame.</L>
</LG>

<L>Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join</L>
<L>Griefs to thy griess, and echo sighs to thine.</L>
<L>Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away:</L>
<L>And is my <HI>Abelard</HI> less kind than they?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,</L>
<L>Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r;</L>
<L>No happier task these faded eyes pursue,</L>
<L>To read and weep is all they now can do.</L>
</LG>

<L>Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;</L>
<L>Ah more than share it! give me all thy grief.</L>
<L>Heav'n first taught letters for some wretches aid,</L>
<L>Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;</L>
<L>They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,</L>
<L>Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,</L>
<L>The virgins wish without her fears impart,</L>
<L>Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,</L>
<L>Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,</L>
<L>And waft a sigh from <HI>Indus</HI> to the <HI>Pole.</HI></L>

<L>Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,</L>

<L>Dim and remote the joys of saints I fee,</L>
<L>Nor envy them, that heav'n I lose for thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft', when press'd to marriage, have I said,</L>
<L>Curse on all laws but those which love has made?</L>
<L>Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,</L>
<L>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</L>
<L>Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,</L>
<L>August her deed, and sacred be her fame;</L>
<L>Before true passion all thofe views remove,</L>
<L>Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?</L>

The jealous God, when we profane his fires,</L>
<L>Those restless passions in revenge inspires;</L>
<L>And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,</L>
<L>Who seek in love for ought but love alone.</L>
<L>Should at my feet the world's great master fall,</L>
<L>Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all:</L>

<L>No, make me mistress to the man I love:</L>
<L>If there be yet another name more free,</L>
<L>More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!</L>
<L>O happy state! when souls each other draw,</L>
<L>When love is liberty, and nature law:</L>
<L>All then is full, possessing, and possest,</L>
<L>No craving Void left aking in the breast:</L>
<L>Ev'n thought meets thought e'er from the lips it part,</L>

<HEAD>A Ballad, by Mr. GAY.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>'TWAS when the seas were roaring</L>
<L>With hollow blasts of wind;</L>
<L>A damsel lay deploring,</L>
<L>All on a rock reclin'd.</L>
<L>Wide o'er the rolling billows</L>
<L>She cast a wistful look;</L>
<L>Her head was crown'd with willows,</L>
<L>That tremble o'er the brook.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Twelve months are gone and over,</L>
<L>And nine long tedious days.</L>
<L>Why didst thou, vent'rous lover,</L>
<L>Why didst thou trust the seas?</L>
<L>Cease, cease, thou cruel ocean,</L>
<L>And let my lover rest;</L>
<L>Ah! what's thy troubled motion</L>
<L>To that within my breast?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>The merchant robb'd of pleasure,</L>
<L>Sees tempests in despair;</L>
<L>But what's the loss of treasure</L>
<L>To losing of my dear?</L>
<L>Should you some coast be laid on</L>
<L>Where gold and di'monds grow,</L>
<L>You'd find a richer maiden,</L>
<L>But none that loves you so.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>How can they say that nature</L>
<L>Has nothing made in vain?</L>
<L>Why then beneath the water</L>
<L>Should hideous rocks remain?</L>
<L>No eyes the rocks discover,</L>
<L>That lurk beneath the deep,</L>
<L>To wreck the wand'ring lover,</L>
<L>And leave the maid to weep.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>All melancholy lying;</L>
<L>Thus wail'd she for her dear;</L>
<L>Repay'd each blast with sighing,</L>
<L>Each billow with a tear;</L>
<L>When o'er the white wave stooping</L>
<L>His floating corpse she spy'd;</L>
<L>Then like a lilly drooping,</L>
<L>She bow'd her head, and dy'd.</L>

<L>Rouse up dull fellow, take thy reed

<SPEAKER>SANDY.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, no, it will not do; leave me to moan;</L>
<L>Till twice eight days are past I'll whistle none.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RICHY.</SPEAKER>
<L>That's strange indeed! has <HI>Jenny</HI> made thee sad?</L>
<L>Or, tell me, hath some horrid spectre, lad,</L>
<L>(Glaring from ruins old, in silent night)</L>
<L>Surpriz'd, and put thee in a panic fright?</L>
<L>Or ails that wether ought, thy favourite?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Such troubles might with much more ease be born:</L>
<L>What's goblins, wethers, or what's woman's
scorn?</L>
<L>Our loss is greater far; for <HI>Addy</HI>'s dead;</L>
<L><HI>Addy,</HI> who sang so sweetly on the mead.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RICHY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Dead is he, say'st thou? guard my heart, oh <HI>Pan!</HI></L>
<L>What burthens, Gods, ye lay on feeble man!</L>
<L>Alack I cannot blame thee for thy grief;</L>
<L>Nor hope I, more than thou, to find relief.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="56"/>
A better lad ne'er lean'd on shepherd's crook,</L>
<L>Nor after game halloo'd his dog to look.</L>
<L>How glad where ews give milk have we three been;</L>
<L>Merry on hills, and gay upon the green!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDY.</SPEAKER>
<L>That's true, indeed; but now, alas! in vain</L>
<L>We seek for pleasure on the rural plain:</L>
<L>I never thought a summer's-day too long</L>
<L>To hear his couplets, or his tuneful song.</L>
<L>How sweet he sang where vines and myrtles grow,</L>
<L>And winding streams which in old <HI>Latium</HI> flows!</L>
<L><HI>Titry,</HI> the <HI>Mantuan</HI> herd, who long ago</L>
<L>Sang best on oaten reed the lover's woe,</L>
<L>Did he, fam'd bard, but live in these our days,</L>
<L>He would with <HI>Addy</HI> freely share his bays.</L>
<L>As long as shepherd's <HI>Amaryllis</HI> hear,</L>
<L>So long his <HI>Rosamond</HI> shall please the ear.</L>
<L>While spangled daisie near the riv'let grows,</L>
<L>And tender lambs seek after bleating ews,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="58"/>
His fame shall last. Last shall his song of wars,</L>
<L>While <HI>British</HI> youngsters boast of ancestors.</L>
<L>Much shall we miss his merry witty jests</L>
<L>At weaning-times, and at our <HI>Lambmass</HI> feasts.</L>
<L>Oh <HI>Richy! Richy!</HI> death hath been unkind</L>
<L>To take the good, and leave the ill behind.</L>
<L>Bow down your heads, ye hills, weep dry ye springs,</L>
<L>For on your banks no more the shepherd sings.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RICHY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then he had always good advice to give,</L>
<L>And could my thoughts, like as my self, conceive.</L>
<L>When I've been drooping, vex'd, or in the spleen,</L>
<L>In one half hour with him I've merry been.</L>
<L>Had <HI>Jenny</HI> froward been, or <HI>Raynard</HI> bold,</L>
<L>Worry'd my lamb, or were my shoes grown old,</L>
<L>Kindly he'd smile, when he observ'd me grieve,</L>
<L>And by his talk divine my breast relieve.</L>
<L><HI>Addy</HI> did all things to perfection know;</L>
<L>Saw by the moon how tides would ebb or flow.</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="60"/>
He knew, what knew he not? E'en to a hair</L>
<L>He'd tell o'er-night if next day would be fair.</L>
<L>The fam'd blind bard sang in mysterious phrase</L>
<L>How envious Satan did first mischief raise;</L>
<L>But oft beneath the well-spread birchen-tree</L>
<L>The beauties of that song he made me see.</L>
<L>The lasses oft' flung down their rakes and pails,</L>
<L>And held their tongues, oh strange! to hear his tales.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDY.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sound be his sleep, and soft his waking be;</L>
<L>More happy is he far than thee or me:</L>
<L>Too good he was for us; the Gods but lent</L>
<L>Him here below, when hither he was sent.</L>
<L>Let us be good, if virtue be our aim,</L>
<L>Then we may meet above the skies again.</L>
<L>But see how tow'rds the glade the fatlings go;</L>
<L><HI>Thomas</HI> hath ta'en the oxen from the plough;</L>
<L><HI>Joan</HI> has prepar'd the supper 'gainst we come,</L>
<L>And late calf'd cows stand lowing near their home;</L>
<L>Then let's have done, and to our rest repair,</L>
<L>And what we cannot help, with patience bear.</L>

<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>Allan Ramsey,</HI> on his <HI>Richy</HI>
and <HI>Sandy.</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. BURCHET.</BYLINE>
<L>WELL fare thee, <HI>Allan,</HI> who, in mother tongue,</L>
<L>So sweetly hath of breathless <HI>Addy</HI> sung.</L>
<L>His endless fame thy nat'ral genius fir'd,</L>
<L>And thou hast written as if he inspir'd.</L>
<L><HI>Richy</HI> and <HI>Sandy,</HI> who do him survive,</L>
<L>Long as thy rural Stanzas last shall live.</L>
<L>The grateful swains thou'st made, in tuneful verse,</L>
<L>Mourn sadly o'er their late—lost patron's herse,</L>
<L>Nor would the <HI>Mantuan</HI> bard, if living, blame</L>
<L>Thy pious zeal, or think thou'st hurt his fame,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Addison</HI>'s inimitable lays</L>
<L>Give him an equal title to the bays.</L>
<L>When he of armies sang, in lofty strains,</L>
<L>It seem'd as if he in the hostile plains</L>
<L>Had present been. His pen hath to the life</L>
<L>Trac'd ev'ry action in the sanguine strife.</L>
<L>In council now sedate the chief appears,</L>
<L>Then loudly thunders in <HI>Bavarian</HI> ears;</L>
<L>And still pursuing the destructive theme,</L>
<L>He pushes them into the rapid stream.</L>
<L>Thus beaten out of <HI>Blenheim</HI>'s neighb'ring fields,</L>
<L>The <HI>Gallic</HI> gen'ral to the victor yields,</L>
<L>Who, as <HI>Britannia</HI>'s <HI>Virgil</HI> hath observ'd,</L>
<L>From threaten'd fate all <HI>Europe</HI> then preserv'd.</L>
<L>Nor dost thou, <HI>Ramsey,</HI> sightless <HI>Milton</HI> wrong</L>
<L>By ought contain'd in thy melodious song;</L>
<L>For none but <HI>Addy</HI> could his thoughts sublime</L>
<L>So well unriddle, or his mystick rhyme.</L>
<L>And when he deign'd to let his fancy rove</L>
<L>Where sun-burnt shepherds to the nymphs make love,</L>
<L>No one e'er told in softer notes the tales</L>
<L>Of rural pleasures in the spangled vales.</L>
<L>So much, oh <HI>Allan!</HI> I thy lines revere,</L>
<L>Such veneration to his mem'ry bear,</L>
<L>That I no longer could my thanks refrain</L>
<L>For what thou'st sung of the lamented swain.</L>
