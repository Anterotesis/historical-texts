<P>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa∣vour of yours of the 8th instant; and will make you a true excuse, (tho' per∣haps no very good one) that I defer'd the troubling you with a letter, when I sent back your Papers, in hopes of seeing you at <HI>Binfield</HI> before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I should freely now (as I have done too pre∣sumptuously in conversation with you) tell
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance with your desires than that I could think it reasonable. For I am not yet satisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of Poetry, who never have been practic'd in the Art. There may possibly be some hap∣py genius's, who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture: But this, tho' it may sometimes be in the right, must be subject to many mistakes, and is certainly but a superficial knowledge; with∣out entring into the art, the methods, and the particular excellencies of the whole composure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Besides my want of skill I have another reason why I ought to suspect my self, by reason of the great affection I have for you, which might give too much biass, to be kind to every thing that comes from you; but after all, I must say (and I do it with an old-fashion'd sincerity) that I en∣tirely approve of your Translation of those Pieces of <HI>Homer,</HI> both as to the versifica∣tion and the true sense that shines thro' the whole; nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion, that you
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
wou'd proceed in translating that incompa∣rable Poet, to make him speak good <HI>En∣glish,</HI> to dress his admirable characters in your proper, significant, and expressive con∣ceptions, and to make his works as useful and instructive to this degenerate age, as he was to our friend <HI>Horace,</HI> when he read him at <HI>Praeneste, Qui, quid sit pul∣chrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c. I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which I confess I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to send this presently to be added to the Mis∣cellanies, and I hope it will come time enough for that purpose.</P>
<P>I have nothing to say of my Nephew <HI>B.</HI>'s observations, for he sent them to me so late, that I had not time to consider them; I dare say he endeavour'd very faithfully (tho' he told me very hastily) to execute your commands.</P>
<P>All I can add is, that if your excess of mo∣desty shou'd hinder you from publishing this <HI>Essay,</HI> I shall only be sorry that I have no more credit with you, to persuade you to oblige the publick, and very particularly, dear Sir,</P>

<P>I Send you <HI>Dennis</HI>'s remarks on the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Criticism.</NOTE><HI>Es∣say,</HI> which equally abound in just Cri∣ticisms and fine Railleries: The few obser∣vations in my hand in the margins, are what a mornings leisure permitted me to make, purely for your perusal. For I am of opinion that such a Critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book, is but one way to be properly an∣swer'd, and that way I wou'd not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time persecuted by For∣tune. This I knew not before; if I had, his name had been spar'd in the Essay, for that only reason. I can't conceive what ground he has for so excessive a re∣sentment; nor imagine how those <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>But <HI>Appius</HI> reddens at each word you speak,</L><L>And stares tremendous with a threatning eye,</L><L>Like some fierce Tyrant in old Tapestry.</L></Q></NOTE> three lines can be call'd a reflection on his <HI>Per∣son,</HI> which only describe him subject a little to Anger on some occasions. I have heard of combatants so very furious, as to fall
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
down themselves with that very blow which they design'd to lay heavy on their anta∣gonists. But if Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienc'd writers from scribling, he shou'd frighten us with his Verse not Prose: for I have often known, that when all the precepts in the world would not re∣claim a sinner, some very sad example has done the business<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verse in the <HI>Dunciad, Book</HI> 1.</NOTE>. Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with reason, and I will alter 'em in ease of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury, and so serve instead of a friend. What he observes at the bottom of page 20th of his reflections, was objected to by your self, and had been mended but for the haste of the press: 'Tis right <HI>Hiber∣nian,</HI> and I confess it what the <HI>English</HI> call a <HI>Bull</HI> in the expression, tho' the sense be manifest enough: Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Bulls are seldom in the expression, they are always in the sense.</P>
<P>I shall certainly never make the least reply to him, not only because you advise me, but because I have ever been of opi∣nion, that if a book can't answer for itself
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no sort of purpose for its author to do it. If I am wrong in any sentiment of that Essay, I protest sin∣cerely, I don't desire all the world should be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill consequence) meerly that I my self may be thought right, (which is of very little con∣sequence). I'd be the first to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my self; for (as I take it) when a man owns himself to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wiser than he was. But I have had an advan∣tage by the publishing that book of <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>'s which otherwise I should never have known: It has been the occasion of ma∣king me friends, and open abetters, of se∣veral gentlemen of known sense and wit; and of proving to me what I have till now doubted, that my writings are taken some notice of by the world in general, or I should never be attack'd thus in par∣ticular. I have read that 'twas a custom among the <HI>Romans,</HI> while a General rode in triumph, to have common soldiers in the streets that rail'd at him and reproach'd him; to put him in mind, that tho' his services were in the main approved and rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep him humble.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
You will see by this, that whoever sets up for wit in these days ought to have the constancy of a primitive christian, and be prepar'd to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it. But sure this is the first time that a Wit was attack'd for his <HI>Religion,</HI> as you'll find I am most zealously in this treatise: and you know Sir, what alarms I have had from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ensuing Letters.</NOTE> opposite side on this account. Have I not reason to cry out with the poor fellow in <HI>Virgil,</HI><Q><L>Quid jam misero mihi denique restat?</L>
<L>Cui neque apud <HI>Danaos</HI> usquam locus, &amp; super ipsi</L>
<L><HI>Dardanidae</HI> infensi paenas cum Sanguine pos∣cunt!</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis however my happiness that you, Sir, are impartial,
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI> was alike to <HI>Latian</HI> and to <HI>Phrygian,</HI></L>
<L>For you well know, that Wit's of no Religion.</L></Q></P>
<P>The manner in which Mr. <HI>D.</HI> takes to pieces several particular lines, detach'd from their natural places, may shew how easy it is to a caviller to give a new sense, or
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
a new nonsence to any thing. And in∣deed his constructions are not more wrest∣ed from the genuine meaning, than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts, as they call'd 'em.</P>
<P>Our friend the <HI>Abbè</HI> is not of that sort, who with the utmost candour and free∣dom, has modestly told me what others thought, and shewn himself one (as he very well expresses it) rather of a <HI>Number</HI> than a <HI>Party.</HI> The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks most sorts of learning flourish'd a∣mong 'em, and I am of opinion that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by 'em: he believes, that in the most na∣tural and obvious sense, that line <HI>(A second deluge Learning over-run)</HI> will be under∣stood of Learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be understood only (as 'tis meant) of polite Learning, Criticism, Poetry, &amp;c. which is the only learning concern'd in the sub∣ject of the Essay. It is true, that the <HI>Monks</HI> did preserve what learning there was, about <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Fifth's time; but those who succeeded fell into the depth of Barba∣rism, or at least stood at a stay while others rose from thence, insomuch that even <HI>Eras∣mus</HI> and <HI>Reuchlin</HI> could hardly laugh them out of it. I am highly oblig'd to the <HI>Ab∣be</HI>'s zeal in my commendation, and good∣ness
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
in not concealing what he thinks my error. And his testifying some esteem for the book, just at a time when his brethren rais'd a clamour against it, is an instance of great generosity and candor, which I shall ever acknowledge.</P>

<P>IN your last you inform'd me of the mistaken zeal of some people, who seem to make it no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous, than Do∣ctors do that they are sick; only that they may magnify their own cure, and triumph over an imaginary distemper. The Simile objected to in my Essay,
<Q><L>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</L>
<L>To one small Sect, and all are damn'd beside.)</L></Q>
plainly concludes at this second line, where stands a full stop: and what follows <HI>(Mean∣ly they seek,</HI> &amp;c.) speaks only of <HI>Wit,</HI> (which is meant by <HI>that blessing,</HI> and <HI>that sun)</HI> for how can the sun of <HI>faith</HI> be said
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
to <HI>sublime the southern wits,</HI> and to <HI>ripen the genius's of northern climates?</HI> I fear these gentlemen understand grammar as little as they do criticism; and perhaps out of good nature to the Monks, are willing to take from 'em the censure of ignorance, and to have it to themselves. The word <HI>They</HI> refers (as I am sure I meant, and as I thought every one must have known) to those critics there spoken of, who are par∣tial to some particular sett of writers, to the prejudice of all others. And the very simile it self, if twice read, may convince them, that the censure here of damning, lies not on our Church at all, unless they call our Church <HI>one small Sect:</HI> and the cautious words, <HI>(by each man)</HI> manifestly show it a general reflection on all such (whoever they are) who entertain those narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi∣nisters and Presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living.</P>
<P>Yet after all, I promise you Sir, if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith tho' weak understand∣ing, I will (tho' it were from no other principle than that of common good na∣ture) comply with it. And if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies, (for it is in a very narrow
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
compass) that stumbling-block tho' it be but a little pebble, shall be removed out of their way. If the heat of these good disputants (who I am afraid being bred up to wrangle in the schools, cannot get rid of the humor all their lives) shou'd pro∣ceed so far as to personal reflections upon me, I assure you notwithstanding I will do, or say nothing, however provok'd (for some people can no more provoke than oblige) that is unbecoming the character of a true Catholick. I will set before me the example of that great man, and great Saint <HI>Erasmus;</HI> who in the midst of ca∣lumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence, and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christianity. However I wou'd advise them to suffer the mention of <HI>him</HI> to pass unregarded, lest I shou'd be forc'd to do that for his reputation which I wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to vindicate so great a light of our Church from the malice of past times, and the ig∣norance of the present, in a language which may extend farther than that in which the Trifle about Criticism is written. I wish these gentlemen wou'd be contented with finding fault with me only, who will sub∣mit to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on∣ly am concern'd; I have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb it
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
for things of so little consequence as my credit and my sense. A little humility can do a Poet no hurt, and a little Charity wou'd do a Priest none: For as St. <HI>Austin</HI> finely says, <HI>Ubi Charitas, ibi Humilitas; ubi Humilitas, ibi Pax.</HI></P>

<P>THE concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation, by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy Vandals have thought fit to pass upon me, makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of setting before you in a clear light the true state of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believ'd the best piece of service one cou'd do to our religion, was openly to express our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and <HI>Piae fraudes,</HI> which it stands so little in need of, and which have laid it under so great a scan∣dal among its enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them, as that too peremptory and seem∣ingly-uncharitable assertion of an utter <HI>Im∣possibility</HI> of <HI>Salvation</HI> to all but our selves; <HI>invincible</HI> ignorance excepted, which in∣deed some people define under so great li∣mitations and with such exclusions, that it seems as if that word were rather in∣vented as a salvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl'd about so freely on almost all mankind by the hands of ecclesiasticks) than as a real exception to almost-universal damnation. For besides the small number of the truly faithful in our Church, we must again subdivide; the <HI>Jansenist</HI> is damn'd by the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> the <HI>Jesuit</HI> by the <HI>Jansenist,</HI> the <HI>Scotist</HI> by the <HI>Thomist,</HI> and so forth.</P>
<P>There may be Errors I grant, but I can't think 'em of such consequence as to destroy utterly the charity of mankind; the very greatest bond in which we are ingag'd by God to one another. Therefore I own to you, I was glad of any opportnnity to ex∣press my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the religion I profess are com∣monly charg'd with; and I hop'd, a slight insinuation, introduc'd so easily by a ca∣sual similitude only, cou'd never have gi∣ven offence; but on the contrary must
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and time, wherein we are the smaller party, and consequently most misrepresented, and most in need of vindication.</P>
<P>For the same reason, I took occasion to mention the <HI>Superstition</HI> of some ages after the subversion of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> which is too manifest a truth to be deny'd, and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith who are free from it. Our silence in these points may with some reason make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those biggotries; which yet in reality all good and sensible Men despise, tho' they are persuaded not to speak against 'em; I can't tell why, since now, 'tis no way the interest even of the worst of our Priesthood (as it might have been then) to have them smother'd in si∣lence: For as the opposite Sects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being slander'd; 'tis our business now to show it is slander'd unjustly, and to vindicate our selves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't so well be brought about with serious faces; we must laugh with them at what deserves it; and then we need not doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi∣nions.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
As to particulars: you cannot but have observ'd that at first the whole objection against the simile of wit and faith lay to the word <HI>They</HI>: When that was beyond contradiction removed (the very Grammar serving to confute 'em) then the objection lies against the <HI>Simile itself;</HI> or if that si∣mile will not be objected to (sense and common reason being indeed a little stub∣born, and not apt to give way to every body) next the mention of <HI>Superstition</HI> must become a crime (as if <HI>Religion</HI> and she were sisters, or that scandal upon the family of <HI>Christ,</HI> to say a word against the Devil's bastard.) Afterwards, more mischief is discover'd in a place that seem'd innocent at first, the two lines about <HI>Schis∣matics,</HI> at the bottom of page 24. An or∣dinary man would imagine the author plainly declar'd against those schismatics, for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the understanding of some sew of its believers: But these believers are call'd <HI>Dull,</HI> and because I say that <HI>those schis∣matics</HI> think <HI>some</HI> believers <HI>dull,</HI> therefore these charitable interpreters of my mean∣ing will have it, that <HI>I</HI> think <HI>all</HI> believers dull. I was telling lately Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> these objections: who assur'd me I had said no∣thing which a Catholick need to disown,
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
and I have cause to know that gentle∣man's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head which I confess I can't but perfectly acquiesce in; that when a sett of people are piqu'd at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage, their method of re∣venge on the truth-speaker is to attack his reputation a By-way, and not openly to object to the place they are really gall'd by: What these therefore (in his opinion) are in earnest angry at, is, that <HI>Erasmus</HI> whom their tribe oppress'd and persecuted shou'd be vindicated after an age of ob∣loquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an honest truth in behalf of the dead, whom no man sure will flatter, and to whom few will do justice. Others, you know were as angry that I mention'd Mr. <HI>Walsh</HI> with honour; who as he never refus'd to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him, so honestly deserv'd it from all others, tho' of ever so diffe∣rent interests or sentiments. May I be ever guilty of this sort of liberty, and la∣titude of principle! which gives us the hardiness of speaking well of those whom envy oppresses ev'n after death. As I wou'd always speak well of my living friends when they are absent, nay because
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
they are absent; so would I much more of the dead, in that eternal absence; and the rather because I expect no thanks for it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you see I do in my conscience persist in what I have written; yet in my friendship I will recant and alter what∣ever you please, in case of a second edi∣tion (which I think the book will not so soon arrive at, for <HI>Tonson</HI>'s printer told me he drew off a thousand copies in this first impression, and I fancy a treatise of this nature, which not one gentleman in three∣score even of a liberal education can un∣derstand, can hardly exceed the vent of that number.) You shall find me a true <HI>Trojan</HI> in my faith, and friendship, in both which I will persevere to the end.</P>

I am afraid to insinuate to you how much I esteem you: Flatterers have taken up the stile which was once peculiar to friends, and an honest man has now no way left to express himself besides the common one of knaves: so that true friends now-a-days differ in their address from flatterers, much as right mastiffs do from spaniels, and show themselves by a dumb surly sort of fidelity, rather than by their complaisant and open kindness.—Will you never leave commending my Poetry? In fair truth Sir, I like it but too well my self already—Expose me no more, I beg you, to the great danger of Vanity, (the rock of all men, but most of young men) and be kindly content for the future, when you wou'd please me throughly, to say only you like what I write.</P>

<P>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter, by which I find you shift the scene of your life from the town to the country, and enjoy that mix'd state which wise men both delight in, and are quali∣lify'd for. Methinks the Moralists and Phi∣losophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending intirely either solitude, or publick life. In the former, men for the most part grow useless by too much rest, and in the latter are destroy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying still, putrify and are good for nothing, and
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others, and are swallow'd up and lost the sooner themselves. Those indeed who can be useful to all states, should be like gentle streams, that not only glide thro' lonely valleys and forests amidst the flocks and the shepherds, but visit populous towns in their course, and are at once of ornament and service to them. But there are an∣other sort of people who seem design'd for solitude, such I mean as have more to hide than to show: As for my own part, I am one of those of whom <HI>Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Tam umbratiles sunt, ut putent in turbido esse quic∣quid in luce est.</HI> Some men like some pic∣tures, are fitter for a corner than a full light; and I believe such as have a natural bent to solitude (to carry on the former similitude) are like waters which may be forc'd into fountains and exalted into a great height, may make a noble figure and a louder noise, but after all they would run more smoothly, quietly and plentiful∣ly, in their own natural course upon the ground. The consideration of this would <NOTE PLACE="foot">The foregoing Similitudes our Author had put into Verse some years before and inserted into Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s Poem on <HI>Mixt Life.</HI> We find him apparently in the Versification of them, as they are since printed in <HI>Wycherley</HI>'s posthumous Works, 8<SUP>o</SUP> <HI>Page</HI> 3<HI>d and</HI> 4<HI><HI>th.</HI></HI></NOTE>

make me very well contented with the possession only of that Quiet which <HI>Cowley</HI> calls the <HI>Companion of Obscurity.</HI> But who∣ever has the Muses too for his companions, can never be idle enough to be uneasy. Thus Sir you see I would flatter my self into a good opinion of my own way of living. <HI>Plutarch</HI> just now told me, that 'tis in hu∣man life as in a game at tables, where a man may wish for the highest cast, but if his chance be otherwise, he is e'en to play it as well as he can and to make the best of it.

<P>YOU formerly observ'd to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the disparity we often find in him sick and well: Thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the weak∣ness of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to consider my self in these diffe∣rent views, and I hope have receiv'd some
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> says be true, that
<Q><L>The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>
<L>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</L></Q></P>
<P>Then surely sickness, contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body, may discover the inward structure more plainly. Sickness is a sort of early old age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state, and inspires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thousand volumes of philosophers and divines. It gives so warning a con∣cussion to those props of our vanity, our strength and youth, that we think of for∣tifying our selves within, when there is so little dependance upon our out-works. Youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age: 'Tis like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank, and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight, but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me, it has afforded several Prospects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
world have not dazzled me very much; and I begin where most people end, with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition, and the unsatisfactory nature of all human pleasures. When a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that honest <HI>Hibernian,</HI> who being in bed in the great storm some years ago, and told the house would tumble over his head, made answer, What care I for the house? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the best time to die when one is in the best hu∣mour, and so excessively weak as I now am I may say with conscience, that I am not at all uneasy at the thought that ma∣ny men whom I never had any esteem for, are likely to enjoy this world after me. When I reflect what an inconsiderable little attom every single man is, with respect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a shame to be concern'd at the removal of such a trivial animal as I am. The morning af∣ter my Exit, the sun will rise as bright as ever, the flowers smell as sweet, the plants spring as green, the world will proceed in its old course, people will laugh as hear∣tily, and marry as fast as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is ele∣gantly express'd in the wisdom of <HI>Solomon)</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day. There are rea∣sons enough, in the fourth chapter of the same book, to make any young man con∣tented with the prospect of death. <HI>For ho∣nourable age is not that which standeth in length of time, or is measur'd by number of years.

<P>I Was the other day in company with five or six men of some learning; where chancing to mention the famous verses which the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> spoke on his death∣bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince in those circumstances. I could not but differ from this opinion: Methinks it was by no means a gay, but a very serious so∣liloquy to his soul at the point of his de∣parture; in which sense I naturally took
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
the verses at my first reading them when I was very young, and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put up∣on them.<Q><L>Animula vagula, blandula,</L>
<L>Hospes comesque corporis,</L>
<L>Quae nunc abibis in loca?</L>
<L>Pallidula, rigida, nudula,</L>

Now what is become of thy former wit and humour? thou shalt jest and be gay no more."</Q></P>
<P>I confess I cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this? 'Tis the most natu∣ral and obvious reflection imaginable to a dying man: and if we consider the Empe∣peror was a heathen, that doubt concer∣ning the future fate of his soul will seem so far from being the effect of want of thought, that 'twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise; not to mention that here is a plain confession included of his belief in its immortality. The dimi∣nutive epithets of <HI>vagula, blandula,</HI> and the

<P>YOU have at length comply'd with the request I have often made you, for you have shown me, I must confess, several of my faults in the sight of those letters. Upon a review of them, I find
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
many things that would give me shame, if I were not more desirous to be thought honest than prudent: so many things freely thrown out, such lengths of unreserv'd friendship, thoughts just warm from the brain, without any polishing or dress, the very dishabille of the understanding. You have prov'd your self more tender of an∣other's embryo's than the fondest mothers are of their own, for you have preserv'd every thing that I miscarry'd of. Since I know this, I shall in one respect be more afraid of writing to you than ever, at this careless rate, because I see my evil works may again rise in judgment against me: Yet in another respect I shall be less afraid, since this has given me such a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my slightest thoughts. The revisal of these let∣ters has been a kind of examination of conscience to me; so fairly and faithfully have I set down in 'em from time to time the true and undistinguish'd state of my mind. But I find that these, which were intended as sketches of my friendship, give as imperfect images of it, as the little landscapes we commonly see in black and white, do of a beautiful country; they can represent but a very small part of it, and that depriv'd of the life and lustre of nature. I perceive that the more I en∣deavour'd
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
to render manifest the real affe∣ction and value I ever had for you, I did but injure it by representing less and less of it: as glasses which are design'd to make an object very clear, generally contract it. Yet as when people have a full idea of a thing, first, upon their own knowledge, the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance, and are not dis∣pleasing on that score: So I hope the fore∣knowledge you had of my esteem for you, is the reason that you do not dislike my letters.</P>
<P>They will not be of any great service (I find) in the design I mentioned to you: I believe I had better steal from a richer man, and plunder your letters, (which I have kept as carefully as I would Letters Patents, since they intitle me to what I more value than titles of honour.) You have some cause to apprehend this usage from me, if what some say be true, that I am a great Borrower; however I have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challeng'd me for it: and those who say it are such, whose writings no man ever borrow'd from, so have the least reason to complain: Their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own.—Another has been pleas'd to declare, that my Verses are corrected by
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
other men: I verily believe theirs were ne∣ver corrected by any man: But indeed if mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have endeavour'd my utmost that they should.

<P>THough any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me, yet I must own your last letter made me uneasy: You really use a style of compliment, which I expect as little as I deserve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young Lady. From the moment one sets up for an author, one must be treated as ceremo∣niously, that is as unfaithfully,
<Q><L>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</L></Q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va∣nity which first makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a cox∣comb for life. But I must grant it is but a just judgment upon Poets, that they whose chief pretence is Wit, shou'd be treated just as they themselves treat Fools, that is, be cajoll'd with praises. And I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
I would not be thought to say this as if the obliging letter you sent me deserv'd this imputation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what <HI>Caesar</HI> said of his Wife. <HI>It was not sufficient that he knew her to be chast, himself, but she shou'd not be so much as suspected by others.</HI></P>
<P>As to the wonderful discoveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of my self; I treat it as you who are in the Secret treat common news, groundless reports of things at a distance, which I who look into the true springs of the affair at home, in my own breast, know to have no foundation at all. For <HI>Fame</HI> tho' it be as <HI>Milton</HI> finely calls it, <HI>The last Infirmity of noble Minds,</HI> is scarce so strong a temp∣tation as to warrant our loss of time here: It can never make us lie down contentedly on a death-bed (as some of the ancients are said to have done with that thought). You Sir have your self taught me, that an easy situation at that hour, can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by the strongest endeavours of the Wit, but may be gain'd by the sincere intentions of the Heart only. As in the next world, so in this, the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind, not the ex∣tent
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
of the capacity: Friendship here is an emanation from the same source as Beati∣tude there: the same benevolence and grate∣ful disposition that qualifies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other. The utmost point of my de∣sires in my present state terminates in the society and good-will of worthy men, which I look upon as no ill earnest and fore-taste of the society and alliance of happy souls hereafter.</P>
<P>The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy, but causes me to set some value upon my self as a part of your care.

To be uncensur'd and to be obscure, is the same thing. You may conclude from what I here say, that 'twas never in my thoughts to have offer'd you my pen in any direct reply to such a Critic, but only in some little raillery; not in defence of you, but in contempt of him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This relates to the Paper occasion'd by <HI>Dennis</HI>'s Remarks upon <HI>Cato,</HI> call'd, Dr. <HI>Norris</HI>'s <HI>Narrative of the Frenzy of</HI> John Den<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></NOTE>But indeed your opinion that 'tis intirely to be neglected, would have been my own had it been my own case: but I felt more warmth here than I did when first I saw his book a∣gainst myself, (tho' indeed in two minutes it made me heartily merry).

<P>I Have receiv'd your letter and am glad to find that you have laid so good a scheme for your great undertaking. I que∣stion not but the Prose will require as much care as the Poetry, but the variety will give your self some relief, and more pleasure to your readers.</P>

<P>YOUR last is the more obliging, as it hints at some little niceties in my conduct, which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me, and which (so trivial as things of this nature seem) are yet of no slight consequence, to people whom every body talks of, and every body as he pleases. 'Tis a sort of Tax that attends an estate in <HI>Parnas∣sus,</HI> which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small posses∣sion an author holds. For indeed an au∣thor who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thank'd for the pleasure, and sometimes ill-treated by those very persons that first debauch'd him. Yet to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way displeas'd that I have offend∣ed the violent of all Parties already; and at the same time I assure you conscien∣tiously, I feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me, or are dissatisfied with me. This frame of mind is so easy, that I am perfectly content with my condi∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52"/>
As I hope and would flatter my self, that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either, so 'tis a pleasure to me that you guess'd so right in regard to the Author of that <HI>Guardian</HI> you mention'd. But I am sorry to find it has taken air that I have some hand in those Papers, because I write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people, nor the disrepute of it with others. An honest <HI>Jacobite</HI> spoke to me the sense or non∣sense of the weak part of his Party ve∣ry fairly, that the good people took it ill of me, that I writ with <HI>Steele,</HI> tho' upon never so indifferent subjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I do: yet I doubt not but many little ca∣lumniators and persons of sower disposi∣tions will take occasion hence to bespatter me. I confess I scorn narrow souls, of all parties, and if I renounce my reason in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pass that the few <HI>Guardians</HI> I have written are so generally known for mine: that in par∣ticular which you mention I never disco∣ver'd to any man but the publisher, till ve∣ry lately: yet almost every body I met told me of it.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53"/>
The true reason that Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> laid down the Paper, was a quarrel between him and <HI>Jacob Tonson.</HI> He stood engag'd to his bookseller, in articles of penalty, for all the <HI>Cuardians:</HI> and by desisting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the <HI>Englishman,</HI> was quit of his obliga∣tion: these papers being printed by <HI>Buck∣lcy.</HI></P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I cannot any way enter into that secret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the rest of his politicks. Tho 'tis said, he will take into these papers also several sub∣jects of the politer kind, as before: But I assure you as to my self, I have quite done with 'em, for the future. The little I have done, and the great respect I bear Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> as a Man of Wit, has render'd me a suspected Whig to some of the vio∣lent, but (as old <HI>Dryden</HI> said before me) 'Tis not the Violent I design to please.</P>
<P>I generally employ the mornings in paint∣ing with Mr. <HI>Jervas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Epistle to him in Verse, writ about this time.</NOTE>; and the evenings in the conversation of such, as I think can most improve my mind, of whatever Party or Denomination they are.

that is honest Principles, with equal capa∣cities. The best way I know of overco∣ming Calumny and Misconstruction, is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right, and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it. 'Tis partly from this maxim that I depend upon your friendship, because I believe it will do ju∣stice to my intention in every thing; and give me leave to tell you, that (as the world goes) this is no small assurance I repose in you.

<P>I Have been lying in wait for my own imagination, this week and more, and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy, that were worth communicating to you in a letter. But I am at length convinc'd that my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort; so I must e'en be contented with telling you the old story, that I love you heartily. I have often found by experience, that na∣ture,
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
and truth, tho' never so low or vul∣gar, are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented; it would be divert∣ing to me, to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent in∣consistencies and tautologies just as it thought 'em. This makes me hope a let∣ter from me will not be unwelcome to you, when I am conscious I write with more unreservedness than ever man wrote, or perhaps talk'd to another. I trust your good nature with the whole range of my follies, and really love you so well, that I would rather you should pardon me than esteem me, since one is an act of goodness and benevolence, the other a kind of con∣strain'd deference.</P>
<P>You can't wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent, when I tell you how they are distracted. Ev'ry hour of my life, my mind is strangely divided; this minute per∣haps I am above the stars, with a thousand systems round about me, looking forward into a vast Abyss, and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of creation, in dialogues with <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> and the Astronomers; the next moment I am below all trifles, groveling with <HI>T<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> in the very center of nonsense. Now I am recreated with the brisk sallies and quick turns of wit, which Mr. <HI>Steele</HI> in his liveliest

<P>Good Good! What an incongruous ani∣mal is Man? how unsettled in his best part, his Soul; and how changing and variable in his frame of Body? The constancy of the one shook by every Notion, the tempe∣rament of the other affected by every blast of wind! What is Man altogether, but one mighty Inconsistency! Sickness and Pain is the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear the portion of the other! What a bustle we make about passing our time, when all our space is but a point? What aims and am∣bitions are crowded into this little instant of our life, which (as <HI>Shakespear</HI> finely words it) is <HI>Rounded with a Sleep?</HI> Our whole extent of Being no more, in the eyes of him who gave it, than a scarce perceptible moment of duration. Those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the Naturalists assure us, are yet as long-lived and possess as wide a scene of action as man, if we consider him with an eye to all Space, and all Eternity. Who knows what plots, what atchievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust, within his life of some minutes? and of how much less

consideration than even this, is the life of man in the sight of that God, who is from Ever, and for Ever!</P>
<P>Who that thinks in this train, but must see the world and its contemptible gran∣deurs lessen before him at every thought? 'Tis enough to make one remain stupify'd, in a poize of inaction, void of all desires, of all designs, of all friendships.</P>
<P>But we must return (thro' our very con∣dition of being) to our narrow selves, and those things that affect our selves: our pas∣sions, our interests, flow in upon us, and unphilosophize us into meer mortals.

and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com∣fortable prospect to be reflecting, that so long a siege as that of <HI>Troy</HI> lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progress. Indeed the <HI>Greek</HI> fortification upon a nearer ap∣proach does not appear so formidable as it did, and I am almost apt to flatter my self, that <HI>Homer</HI> secretly seems inclined to a cor∣respondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are indeed, a sort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo∣ple by their number and bulk, and perplex our progress under pretence of fortifying their author. These lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have digg'd, encompass'd with dirt of their own heaping up, but I think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by mining under ground, that is, by using the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly∣ing over their heads.</P>
<P>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find you are concern'd how I shall be paid, and are sollicitous that I may not have the ill fate of many discarded Generals, to be first envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd, and lastly neglected. The former (the
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
constant attendant upon all great and lau∣dable enterprizes) I have already experi∣enc'd. Some have said I am not a Master in the <HI>Greek,</HI> who either are so themselves or are not: If they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without having catechiz'd me. But if they can read (for I know some Critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying be∣fore them, some specimens of my tran∣slation from this Author in the <HI>Miscel∣lanies,</HI> which they are heartily welcome to. I have met with as much malignity another way, some calling me a Tory, because the heads of that party have been distinguishingly favourable to me; some a Whig because I have been favour'd with yours, Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and Mr. <HI>Craggs</HI> his friendship, and of late with my Lord <HI>Hal∣lifax</HI>'s Patronage. How much more natu∣ral a conclusion might be form'd, by any good-natur'd man, that a person who has been well us'd by all sides, has been offen∣sive to none. This miserable age is so sunk between animosities of Party and those of Religion, that I begin to fear, most men have politicks enough to make (thro' vio∣lence) the best Scheme of Government a bad one; and faith enough to hinder their own Salvation. I hope for my own part, never to have more of either than is con∣sistent

Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a <HI>Papist</HI> here, where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much, and to the fifth part as being so too little; I shall yet be easy under both their mistakes, and be what I more than seem to be, for I suffer for it.

<P>I remember to have heard you mention some half-form'd design of coming to <HI>Italy.</HI> What might we not expect from a Muse that sings so well in the bleak climate of <HI>England,</HI> if she felt the same warm Sun and breath'd the same Air with <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace?</HI></P>

Verse. If one who knows so well how to write like the old <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, came among them; it wou'd probably be a means to retrieve them from their cold, trivial con∣ceits, to an imitation of their Predeces∣sors.</P>
<P>As Merchants, Antiquaries, Men of Plea∣sure, &amp;c. have all different views in tra∣velling; I know not whether it might not be worth a Poet's while, to travel, in or∣der to store his mind with strong Images of Nature.</P>

<P>THE Question you ask in relation to Mr. <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> and <HI>Philips,</HI> I shall an∣swer in a few words. Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> did ex∣press himself with much indignation against me one evening at <HI>Button</HI>'s Coffee-house (as I was told) saying, That I was enter'd into a Cabal with Dean <HI>Swift</HI> and others to write against the <HI>Whig-Interest,</HI> and in par∣ticular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends <HI>Steel</HI> and <HI>Addison.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> never open'd his lips to my face, on this or any like occasion, tho' I was almost every night in the same room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> came to me a night or two after <HI>Philips</HI> had talk'd in this idle manner, and assur'd me of his dis∣belief of what had been said, of the friend∣ship we shou'd always maintain, and de∣sir'd I would say nothing further of it. My Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> did me the honour to stir in this matter, by speaking to several people to obviate a false aspersion, which might have done me no small prejudice with one Party. However <HI>Philips</HI> did all
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
he could, secretly to continue the report with the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club, and kept in his hands the Subscriptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have since given him to understand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with a man whom I think a scoundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for this money, but commission'd one of the <HI>Players,</HI> his equals, to receive it. This is the whole matter; but as to the secret grounds of <HI>Philips</HI>'s malignity, they will make a very pleasant History when we meet. Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> and some others have been much diverted with it, and most of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their Secretary. It is to this management of <HI>Philips,</HI> that the world owes Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s <HI>Pastorals.</HI> The ingenious Author is extream∣ly your servant, and would have comply'd with your kind invitation, but that he is just now appointed Secretary to my Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> in his Embassy to <HI>Hanover.</HI></P>

<P>YOU mention the account I gave you some time ago of the things which <HI>Philips</HI> said in his foolishness; but I can't tell from any thing in your Letter, whe∣ther you receiv'd a long one from me a∣bout a fortnight since. It was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence. I there launch'd into some account of my tem∣poral affairs, and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual. The conclu∣sion of your Letter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you <HI>pray'd</HI> for me: Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of most other Friends, who never talk of praying for a Man after they have done
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
him a service, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human Sciences, which I assure you I am daily more and more convinc'd of; and indeed I have for some years past, look'd upon all of 'em no better than amusements. To make them the ultimate end of our pursuit, is a miserable and short ambition, which will drop from us at ev'ry little dis∣appointment here, and even in case of no disappointments here, will infallibly desert us hereafter. The utmost fame they are capable of bestowing, is never worth the pains they cost us, and the time they lose us. If you attain the top of your desires that way, all those who envy you will do you harm; and of those who admire you, few will do you good. The unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies, and pro∣bably the successful your secret ones: For those hate not more to be excell'd, than these to be rivall'd. And at the upshot, after a life of perpetual application, to re∣flect that you have been doing nothing for your self, and that the same or less In∣dustry might have gain'd you a Friendship that can never deceive or end, a satisfaction which praise cannot bestow, nor vanity feel, and a glory which (tho' in one respect like fame, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
shall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. These, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my sentiments, whenever I think at all; for half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts, they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination: Our schemes of government, our systems of phi∣losophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but so many shadowy images, and airy pros∣pects, which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent, as we are more o'ercast with the darkness, and disturb'd with the fumes of human vanity.</P>
<P>The same thing that makes old men wil∣ling to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long-habit, and weariness of the same track. <HI>Homer</HI> will work a cure upon me; fifteen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years, to make one old in Rhime: And I shou'd be sorry and ashamed, to go on jingling to the last step, like a waggoner's horse, in the same road, and so leave my <HI>Bells</HI> to the next silly ani∣mal that will be proud of 'em. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason, who is measuring syllables and coupling rhimes, when he shou'd be mending his own Soul, and securing his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I should be unwor∣thy even of those small and limited parts

<P>I Have no better excuse to offer you, that I have omitted a task naturally so plea∣sing to me as conversing upon paper with you; but that my time and eyes have been wholly employ'd upon <HI>Homer,</HI> whom I al∣most fear I shall find but one way of imita∣ting, which is, in his blindness.

<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men. The notions of right and wrong are so far strain'd, that perhaps to be in the right so very violently, may be of worse consequence than to be easily and qui∣etly in the wrong. I really wish all men so well, that I am satisfied but few can wish me so; but if those few are such as tell me they do, I am content, for they are the best people I know: While you believe me what I profess as to Religion, I can bear any thing the bigotted may say; while Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> likes my poetry, I can endure <HI>Dennis</HI> and a thousand more like him; while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can easily support it, tho' the most violent and mad of all parties rose up to throw dirt at me.</P>

It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but endeavour to distinguish himself, or gratify others by his studies, he is immediately treated as a common enemy, instead of being look'd upon as a common friend; and assaulted as generally, as if his whole design were to prejudice the State, and ruin the publick. I will venture to say, no man ever rose to any degree of perfection in writing, but through obstinacy and an in∣veterate resolution against the stream of man∣kind: So that if the world has receiv'd any benefit from the labours of the Learned, it was in its own despite. For when first they essay their parts, all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then some particular persons who were before un∣fortunate in their own attempts, are sworn foes to them only because they succeed.—Upon the whole, one may say of the best writers, that they pay a severe fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please.</P>

<P>I Am just enter'd upon the old way of life again, sleep and musing. It is my employment to revive the old of past ages to the present, as it is yours to transmit the young of the present, to the future. I am copying the great Master in one art, with the same love and diligence with which the Painters hereafter will copy you in another.</P>
<P>Thus I should begin my Epistle to you, if it were a <HI>Dedicatory</HI> one. But as it is a friendly letter, you are to find nothing mention'd in your own praise but what only one in the world is witness to, your particular good-natur'd offices to me. What∣ever mankind in general would allow you, that I am not to give you to your face; and if I were to do it in your absence, the world would tell me I am too partial to be permitted to pass any judgment of you.</P>

And as for the last, what can you expect from a man who has not talk'd these five days? who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can, from all the present world, its customs and its manners, to be fully possest and absorpt in the past?

<P>I have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of Poetry, for it takes me up so intirely that I scarce see what passes under my nose, and hear nothing that is said about me. To fol∣low Poetry as one ought, one must forget father and mother, and cleave to it alone. My <HI>Rêverie</HI> has been so deep, that I have scarce had an interval to think my self un∣easy in the want of your company.

I fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours, because I am pretty sure there never was a friendship of so easie a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Va∣nity we have expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Artist you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope, (piously hope) to hear these things. At home we follow our business, when we have any; and think and talk most of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friendship of a stay'd man and his wife, who are seldom so fond as to hin∣der the business of the house from going on all day, or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the last, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantick friend∣ships, like violent loves, begin with dis∣quiets, proceed to jealousies, and conclude in animosities. I have liv'd to see the fierce advancement, the sudden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of these enormous friendships, and am perfectly con∣vinc'd of the truth of a Maxim we once agreed in, That nothing hinders the con∣stant agreement of people who live toge∣ther,

but meer vanity; a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity or merit, and an inward expectation of such an Over-measure of deference and regard, as answers to their own extravagant false scale; and which no body can pay, because none but themselves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts?</P>

<P>WHatever studies on the one hand, or amusements on the other, it shall be my fortune to fall into, I shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of 'em. The Task I undertook<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Translation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE>, tho' of weight enough in itself, has had a voluntary in∣crease, by the inlarging my design of the <HI>Notes;</HI> and the necessity of consulting a number of books has carry'd me to <HI>Ox∣ford:</HI> But I fear, thro' my Lord <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s and Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s means, I shall be more con∣versant with the pleasures and company of

the place, than with the Books and Manu∣scripts of it.</P>
<P>I find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of <HI>old Greece,</HI> since I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the publick libraries here. But with all the care I am capable of, I have some cause to fear the Engraver will prejudice me in a few situ∣ations. I have been forced to write to him in so high a style, that were my epistle in∣tercepted, it would raise no small admira∣tion in an ordinary man. There is scarce an order in it of less importance, than to remove such and such mountains, alter the course of such and such rivers, place a large city on such a coast, and raze another in another country. I have set bounds to the sea, and said to the land, <HI>thus far shalt thou advance</HI> and <HI>no further</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This relates to the Map of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> laid down by our Author in his Observations on the second <HI>Iliad.</HI></NOTE>. In the mean time, I who talk and command at this rate, am in danger of losing my horse, and stand in some fear of a country justice. To dis∣arm me indeed may be but prudential, con∣sidering what armies I have at present on foot, and in my service: a hundred thou∣sand <HI>Grecians</HI> are no contemptible body; for all that I can tell, they may be as for∣midable

as four thousand <HI>Priests;</HI> and they seem proper forces to send against those in <HI>Barcetona.</HI> That siege deserves as fine a poem as the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the machining part of poetry would be the juster in it, as they say the inhabitants expect Angels from hea∣ven to their assistance. May I venture to say, who am a <HI>Papist,</HI> and to say to you who are a <HI>Papist,</HI> that nothing is more a∣stonishing to me, than that people so greatly warm'd with a sense of Liberty, should be capable of harbouring such weak Supersti∣tion, and that so much bravery and so much folly, can inhabit the same breasts?</P>
<P>I could not but take a trip to <HI>London,</HI> on the death of the <HI>Queen,</HI> mov'd by the com∣mon curiosity of mankind, who leave their own business to be looking upon other men's. I thank God that as for my self, I am be∣low all the accidents of State-changes by my circumstances, and above them by my phi∣losophy. Common charity of man to man, and universal good will to all, are the points I have most at heart; and I am sure those are not to broken for the sake of any go∣vernors, or government. I am willing to hope the best, and what I more wish than my own or any particular man's advance∣ment, is, that this turn may put an end entirely to the divisions of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory;</HI> that the parties may love each other as

well as I love them both; or at least hurt each other as little as I would either; and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs; that is to say, that want of <HI>power</HI> it self in us may not be a surer prevention of harm, than want of <HI>will</HI> in them. I am sure if all <HI>Whigs</HI> and all <HI>Tories</HI> had the spirit of one <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> that I know, it would be well for all <HI>Roman-Catholicks;</HI> and if all <HI>Roman-Catholicks</HI> had always had that spirit, it had been well for all others, and we had never been charg'd with so wicked a spirit as that of Persecution.</P>
<P>I agree with you in my sentiment of the state of our nation since this change: I find my self just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own, hear∣tily wishing the good, that is the quiet of my country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by party∣spirit, which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few.</P>

He assured me that he wou'd make use not only of his interest, but of his art to do you some service; he did not mean his Art of Poetry, but his Art at Court; and he is sensible that nothing can have a better air for himself, than moving in your favour, especially since in∣sinuations were spread that he did not care you shou'd prosper too much as a Poet. He protests that it shall not be his fault if there is not the best intelligence in the world, and the most hearty friendship, &amp;c. He owns, he was afraid Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> might have carry'd you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animosity, but now

all is safe, and you are escap'd even in his opinion▪ I promis'd in your name, like a good Godfather, not that you should re∣nounce the devil and all his works, but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake; therefore prepare your self for some civilities.</P>

<P>I admire your <HI>Whig-principles</HI> of Resist∣ance exceedingly, in the spirit of the <HI>Bar∣celonians.</HI> I joyn in your wish for them. Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s verses on Liberty, in his let∣ter from <HI>Italy,</HI> would be a good form of prayer in my opinion, <HI>O Liberty! thou Goddess heavenly bright!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What you mention'd of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> and me, deserves acknowledg∣ments on my part. You thoroughly know my regard to his character, and my pro∣pensity to testify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the scandalous meanness of that proceeding which was used by <HI>Philips,</HI> to make a man I so highly value, suspect my dispositions toward him. But as, after all, Mr. <HI>Addi∣son</HI> must be the judge in what regards him∣self, and has seem'd to be no very just one to me; so I must own to you I expect no∣thing but civility from him, how much soever I wish for his friendship: And as for any offices of real kindness or service which it is in his power to do me, I should be asham'd to receive 'em from any man who had no better opinion of my morals, than to think me a party-man; nor of my temper, than to believe me capable of ma∣ligning,

or envying another's reputation as a Poet. So I leave it to time to convince him as to both, to shew him the shallow depths of those half-witted creatures who mis-inform'd him, and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person whom I would be proud to imitate, and therefore asham'd to flatter. In a word, Mr. <HI>Addison</HI> is sure of my respect at all times, and of my real friendship when∣ever he shall think fit to know me for what I am.</P>
<P>For all that pass'd betwixt Dr. <HI>Swift</HI> and me, you know the whole (without reserve) of our correspondence: The engagements I had to him were such as the actual ser∣vices he had done me, in relation to the subscription for <HI>Homer,</HI> obliged me to. I must have leave to be grateful to him, and to any one who serves me, let him be never so obnoxious to any party: nor did the <HI>Tory-party</HI> ever put me to the hardship of asking this leave, which is the greatest obligation I owe to it; and I expect no greater from the <HI>Whig-party</HI> than the same liberty.—A curse on the word <HI>Party,</HI> which I have been forc'd to use so often in this period! I wish the present Reign may put an end to the distinction, that there may be no other for the future than that of honest and knave, fool and man of sense;

<P>I Have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me, that you have lately been pleas'd to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect I have for you can deserve. May I hope that some late malevolencies have lost their effect? Indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene∣mies, to pretend to tell you whether I am your friend or not; but if you would judge by probabilities, I beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has so little In∣terest in pretending to be so? Methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who desires no real service: I am only to get as much from the <HI>Whigs,</HI> as I got by the <HI>Tories,</HI> that is to say, Civility; being neither so proud as to be insensible of any good office, nor so humble, as not
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice.</P>
<P>I will not value my self upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you; for (to say the truth) all the world speaks well of you, and I should be under a necessity of doing the same, whether I car'd for you or not.</P>
<P>As to what you have said of me, I shall never believe that the Author of <HI>Cato</HI> can speak one thing and think another. As a proof that I account you sincere, I beg a favour of you: It is, that you would look over the two first books of my translation of <HI>Homer,</HI> which are now in the hands of my Lord <HI>Halifax.</HI> I am sensible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it: 'tis therefore some evidence of the trust I repose in your good will, when I give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice, and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts, at the same time that you tell others your most favourable ones.</P>
<P>I have a farther request, which I must press with earnestness. My Bookseller is reprinting the <HI>Essay on Criticism,</HI> to which you have done too much honour in your <HI>Spectator</HI> of N<SUP>o</SUP> 253. The period in that paper, where you say, <Q REND="inline">"I have admitted some strokes of ill nature into that Essay,"</Q>
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
is the only one I could wish omitted of all you have written: but I wou'd not desire it should be so, unless I had the merit of removing your objection: I beg you but to point out those strokes to me, and you may be assured they shall be treated with∣out mercy.</P>
<P>Since we are upon proofs of sincerity (which I am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each others opinion) give me leave to name another passage in the same <HI>Spectator,</HI> which I wish you would alter. It is where you men∣tion an observation upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s Verses of <HI>Sysiphus</HI>'s Stone, as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These Words are since left out in Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s Edition, but were extant in all during Mr. <HI>Addison</HI>'s Life.</NOTE><HI>never having been made before by any of the Criticks:</HI> I happen'd to find the same in <HI>Dyonisius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus</HI>'s Treatise, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, who treats very largely upon these Verses.

<HEAD>Mr. POPE to the Earl of B<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your Mare could speak, she would give you an account of the extraordi∣nary company she had on the road; which since she cannot do, I will.</P>
<P>It was the enterprizing Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> the redoubtable rival of Mr. <HI>Tonson,</HI> who mount∣ed on a stonehorse, (no disagreeable compa∣nion to your Lordships mare) overtook me in <HI>Windsor-forest.</HI> He said, he heard I de∣sign'd for <HI>Oxford,</HI> the seat of the muses, and would, as my bookseller, by all means, ac∣company me thither.</P>
<P>I ask'd him where he got his horse? He answer'd, he got it of his publisher: <Q REND="inline">"For that rogue, my printer, (said he) disap∣pointed me: I hoped to put him in good humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two shillings, with two quarts of wine, be∣sides my conversation. I thought my self cocksure of his horse, which he readily promis'd me, but said, that Mr. <HI>Tonson</HI> had just such another design of going to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> expecting there the copy of <HI>a Comment upon the Revelations;</HI> and if
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
Mr. <HI>Tonson</HI> went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the said copy."</Q></P>
<P>So in short, I borrow'd this stonehorse of my publisher, which he had of Mr. <HI>Old∣mixon</HI> for a debt; he lent me too the pret∣ty boy you see after me; he was a smutty dog yesterday, and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face: but the De∣vil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his catechise: if you have any more baggs, he shall carry them.</P>
<P>I thought Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>'s civility not to be neglected, so gave the boy a small bagg, containing three shirts and an Elzevir <HI>Vir∣gil;</HI> and mounting in an instant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid Devil behind.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> began in this manner. <Q REND="inline">"Now damn them! what if they should put it into the news-paper, how you and I went together to <HI>Oxford?</HI> why what would I care? If I should go down into <HI>Sussex,</HI> they would say I was gone to the Speaker. But what of that? if my son were but big enough to go on with the business, by G-d I would keep as good company as old <HI>Jacob.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon I enquir'd of his son. <Q REND="inline">"The lad (says he) has fine parts, but is some∣what
<PB N="98" REF="97"/>
what sickly, <HI>much as you are</HI>—I spare for nothing in his education at <HI>Westmin∣ster.</HI> Pray don't you think <HI>Westminster</HI> to be the best school in <HI>England?</HI> most of the <HI>late Ministry</HI> came out of it, so did many of <HI>this Ministry;</HI> I hope the boy will make his fortune."</Q></P>
<P>Don't you design to let him pass a year at <HI>Oxford?</HI><Q REND="inline">"To what purpose? (said he) the Universities do but make Pedants, and I intend to breed him a man of Bu∣siness."</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> was talking, I observ'd he sate uneasy on his saddle, for which I express'd some sollicitude: Nothing says he, I can bear it well enough; but since we have the day before us, methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest a-while under the Woods. When were alighted, <Q REND="inline">"See here, what a mighty pretty <HI>Horace</HI> I have in my pocket? what if you amus'd your self in turning an Ode, till we mount again? Lord! if you pleas'd, what a clever <HI>Miscellany</HI> might you make at lei∣sure hours."</Q> Perhaps I may, said I, if we ride on; the motion is an aid to my fancy; a round trott very much awakens my spirits. Then jog on apace, and I'll think as hard as I can.</P>
<P>Silence ensu'd for a full hour; after which <HI>Mr. Lintott</HI> lug'd the reins, stopt
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
short, and broke out, <Q REND="inline">"Well Sir, how far have you gone?"</Q> I answer'd seven miles. <Q REND="inline">"Z<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>ds Sir, said <HI>Lintott,</HI> I thought you had done seven stanza's. <HI>Oldsworth</HI> in a ramble round <HI>Wimbleton-hill,</HI> would translate a whole Ode in half this time. I'll say that for <HI>Oldsworth,</HI> (tho' I lost by his <HI>Timothy</HI>'s) he translates an Ode of <HI>Horace</HI> the <HI>quickest</HI> of any man in <HI>En∣gland.</HI> I remember Dr. <HI>King</HI> would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could n't speak: and there's Sir <HI>Richard</HI> in that rumbling old Chariot of his, be∣tween <HI>Fleet-ditch</HI> and St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s pound shall make you half a <HI>Job.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Pray Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> (said I) now you talk of Translators, what is your method of ma∣naging them? <Q REND="inline">"Sir (reply'd he) those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world: In a hungry fit, they'll swear they un∣derstand all the languages in the uni∣verse: I have known one of them take down a <HI>Greek</HI> book upon my counter and cry, Ay this is <HI>Hebrew,</HI> I must read it from the latter end. By G-d I can never be sure in these fellows, for I nei∣ther understand <HI>Greek, Latin, French,</HI> nor <HI>Italian</HI> my self. But this is my way: I agree with them for ten shillings <HI>per</HI> sheet, with a proviso, that I will have their doings corrected by whom I
<PB N="100" REF="99"/>
please; so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author; my judgment giving the negative to all my Translators."</Q> But how are you se∣cure that those correctors may not impose upon you? <Q REND="inline">"Why I get any civil gentle∣man, (especially any <HI>Scotchman)</HI> that comes into my shop, to read the origi∣nal to me in <HI>English;</HI> by this I know whether my first Translator be deficient, and whether my Corrector merits his money or no?"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I'll tell you what happen'd to me last month: I bargain'd with <HI>S<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> for a new version of <HI>Lucretius</HI> to publish against <HI>Tonson</HI>'s; agreeing to pay the au∣thor so many shillings at his producing so many lines. He made a great pro∣gress in a very short time, and I gave it to the corrector to compare with the <HI>Latin;</HI> but he went directly to <HI>Creech</HI>'s translation, and found it the same word for word, all but the first page. Now, what d'ye think I did? I arrested the <HI>Translator</HI> for a cheat; nay, and I stopt the <HI>Corrector's pay</HI> too, upon this proof that he had made use of <HI>Creech</HI> instead of the original."</Q></P>
<P>Pray tell me next how you deal with the Critics? <Q REND="inline">"Sir (said he) nothing more easy. I can silence the most formidable
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
of them; the rich one's for a sheet a∣piece of the blotted manuscript, which costs me nothing. They'll go about with it to their acquaintance, and pre∣tend they had it from the author, who submitted to their correction: this has given some of them such an air, that in time they come to be consulted with, and dedicated to, as the top critics of the town.—As for the poor Critics, I'll give you one instance of my manage∣ment, by which you may guess at the rest. A lean man that look'd like a very good scholar, came to me t'other day; he turn'd over <HI>Homer,</HI> shook his head, shrug'd up his shoulders, and pish'd at every line of it; <HI>One would wonder</HI> (says he) <HI>at the strange presumption of men;</HI> Homer <HI>is no such easy task, that</HI> every <HI>Stripling,</HI> every <HI>Versifier</HI>—he was going on when my Wife call'd to dinner: Sir, said I, will you please to eat a <HI>piece of beef</HI> with me? Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> said he, <HI>I am sorry you should be at the expence of this great book, I am really con∣cern'd on your account</HI>—Sir I am much oblig'd to you: if you can dine upon a piece of beef, together with a slice of pudding—<HI>Mr.</HI> Lintott, <HI>I do not say but Mr.</HI> Pope, <HI>if he would condescend to ad∣vise with men of learning</HI>—Sir, the <HI>pud∣ding</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="101"/>
is upon the table, if you please to go in—My critic complies, he comes to a taste of your poetry, and tells me in the same breath, that the <HI>Book</HI> is commendable, and the <HI>Pudding</HI> excel∣lent."</Q></P>
<P>Now Sir (concluded Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI>) in re∣turn to the frankness I have shewn, pray tell me, <Q REND="inline">"Is it the opinion of your friends at Court that my Lord <HI>L<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> will be brought to the Bar or not?"</Q> I told him I heard <HI>not,</HI> and I hop'd it, my Lord be∣ing one I had particular obligations to. <Q REND="inline">"That may be (reply'd Mr. <HI>Lintott)</HI> but by G-d if he is not, I shall lose the print∣ing of a very good Trial."</Q></P>
<P>These my Lord are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of my friend Mr. <HI>Lintott,</HI> which I have chosen for the subject of a letter. I dropt him as soon as I got to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and paid a visit to my Lord <HI>Carlton</HI> at <HI>Middleton.</HI></P>
<P>The conversations I enjoy here are not to be prejudic'd by my pen, and the plea∣sures from them only to be equal'd when I meet your Lordship. I hope in a few days to cast my self from your horse at your feet.</P>

assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection I have long born you, and the memory of so many agreeable conver∣sations as we have pass'd together.

Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politicks as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine sense, refin'd sense, and exalted sense; but for use and happiness give me a little com∣mon sense. I say this in regard to some gentlemen, profess'd wits of our acquain∣tance, who fancy they can make Poetry of consequence at this time of day, in the midst of this raging fit of Politicks. For they tell me, the busy part of the nation are not more divided about <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> than these idle fellows of the Feather about Mr. <HI>Tickel</HI>'s and my Translation.

The new Translator of <HI>Homer</HI> is the hum∣blest slave he has, that is to say, his first Minister; let him receive the honours he gives him, but receive them with fear and trembling: let him be proud of the ap∣probation of his absolute Lord; I appeal to the People, as my rightful judges and masters; and if they are not inclin'd to condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high-flying proceedings from the small Court-faction at <HI>Button</HI>'s.

I cannot forbear to add a piece of ar∣tifice I have been guilty of, on occasion of my being oblig'd to congratulate the birth-day of a friend of mine: When finding I had no materials of my own, I very frankly sent him your imitation of <HI>Martial</HI>'s Epigram on <HI>Antonius Primus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Jam numerat placido felix Antonius aevo, &amp;c.</Q>
<P>Sir <HI>William Trumbull</HI> was born at <HI>Easthampsted</HI> in <HI>Berk∣shire:</HI> He was Fellow of <HI>All Souls</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> follow'd the Study of the Civil Law, and was sent by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second Judge-Advocate to <HI>Tangier,</HI> thence Envoy to <HI>Flo∣rence, Turin,</HI> &amp;c. and in his way back, Envoy Extraordinary to <HI>France:</HI> from thence, sent by King <HI>James</HI> the Second Ambas∣sador to the <HI>Ottoman Porte.</HI> Afterwards he was made Lord of the Treasury, then Secretary of State with the Duke of <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI> which Office he resign'd in 1697. He retir'd to <HI>East∣hamsted,</HI> in <HI>Windsor Forest,</HI> and died in the Place of his Na∣tivity in <HI>December</HI> 1716, aged 77 Years. Our Author cele∣brated that Retirement in his Poem on the Forest, and addrest to him his first Pastoral at 16 Years of Age.</P></NOTE>. This has been applauded so much, that I am in danger of commencing Poet, perhaps Laureat, (pray desire my good friend Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> to enter a Caveat) provided you will further increase my stock in this bank. In which proceeding I have laid the foun∣dation of my estate, and as <HI>honestly</HI> as many others have begun theirs. But now being a little tender, as young beginners often are, I offer to you (for I have con∣ceal'd the true author) whether you will give me orders to declare who is the Father of this fine child, or not?

<P>THO', as you rightly remark, I pay my Tax but once in half a Year, yet you shall see by this Letter upon the neck of my last, that I pay a double Tax, as we Non-Jurors ought to do. Your Ac∣quaintance on this side the Sea are un∣der terrible Apprehensions, from your long stay in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that you may grow too Polite for them; for we think (since the great success of so damn'd a Play as the Non-Juror) that Politeness is gone over the Water. But others are of opinion it has been longer among you, and was intro∣duced much about the same time with <HI>Frogs,</HI> and with equal Success. Poor <HI>Poetry!</HI> the little that's left of it here longs to cross the Seas, and leave <HI>Eusden</HI> in full

and peaceable Possession of the British Lau∣rel: And we begin to wish you had the singing of our Poets, as well as the croak∣ing of our Frogs, to yourselves in <HI>Saecula Saeculorum.</HI> It would be well in exchange, if <HI>Parnelle,</HI> and two or three more of your Swans, would come hither, especially that Swan, who, like a true modern one, does not sing at all, Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> I am (like the rest of the World) a Sufferer by his Idle∣ness. Indeed I hate that any Man should be idle, while I must translate and comment; And I may the more sincerely wish for good Poetry from others, because I am become a person out of the question; for a Trans∣lator is no more a Poet, than a Taylor is a Man.</P>
<P>You are doubtless persuaded of the Va∣lidity of that famous Verse,
<Q><L>'Tis Expectation makes a Blessing dear:</L></Q>
but why would you make your Friends fon∣der of you than they are? There's, no man∣ner of need of it—We begin, to expect you no more than <HI>Anti-christ.</HI> A Man that hath absented himself so long from his Friends, ought to be put into the Ga∣zette.</P>
<P>Every Body here has great need of you. Many Faces have died for ever for want of your Pencil, and blooming Ladies have

wither'd in expecting your return. Even <HI>Frank</HI> and <HI>Betty</HI> (that constant Pair) can∣not console themselves for your Absence; I fancy they will be forced to make their own Picture in a pretty Babe, before you come home: 'Twill be a noble Subject for a Family Piece. Come then, and having peopled <HI>Ireland</HI> with a World of beau∣tiful Shadows, come to us, and see with that Eye (which, like the Eye of the World, creates Beauties by looking on them) see, I say, how <HI>England</HI> has alter'd the Airs of all its heads in your Absence; and with what sneaking City Attitudes our most celebrated Personages appear in the meer mortal Works of our Painters.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fortescue</HI> is much yours; <HI>Gay</HI> com∣memorates you; and lastly (to climb by just steps and degrees) my Lord <HI>Burlington</HI> desires you may be put in mind of him. His Gardens flourish, his Structures rise, his Pictures arrive, and (what is far nobler and more valuable than all) his own good Qualities daily extend themselves to all about him: Whereof, I the meanest next to some <HI>Italian</HI> Chymists, Fidlers, Brick∣layers, and Opera-makers) am a living Instance.</P>

<P>IF I had not done my utmost to lead my Life so pleasantly as to forget all Misfortunes, I should tell you I reckoned your Absence no small one; but I hope you have also had many good and plea∣sant Reasons to forget your Friends on this side the World. If a wish could transport me to you, and your present Companions, I could do the same. Dr. <HI>Swift,</HI> I believe, is a very good Landlord, and a chearful Host at his own Table; I suppose he has perfectly learnt himself, what he has taught so many others, <HI>Rupta non insanire lagena.</HI> Else he would not make a proper Host for your humble Servant, who (you know) tho' he drinks a Glass as seldom as any Man, contrives to break one as often. But 'tis a Consolation to me, that I can do this, and many other Enormities, under my own Roof.</P>
<P>But that you and I are upon equal terms of all friendly Laziness, and have taken an inviolable Oath to each other, always to do what we will; I should reproach you for so long a silence. The best amends you can make for saying

<P>THAT you have not heard from me of late, ascribe not to the usual lazi∣ness of your Correspondent, but to a ram∣ble to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where your name is men∣tion'd with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of Doctor <HI>Clarke:</HI> He entertain'd me with several Drawings, and particularly with the origi∣nal designs of <HI>Inigo Jones</HI>'s <HI>Whitehall.</HI> I there saw and reverenced some of your first Pieces; which future Painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the <HI>Culex</HI> of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and <HI>Batrachom.</HI> of <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P>Having named this latter piece, give me leave to ask what is become of Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and his Frogs? <HI>Oblitusque meorum, oblivis∣cendus &amp; illis,</HI> might be <HI>Horace</HI>'s wish, but will never be mine, while I have such <HI>meo∣rums</HI> as Dr. <HI>Parnelle</HI> and Dr. <HI>Swift.</HI> I hope the spring will restore you to us, and with you all the beauties and colours of nature. Not but I congratulate you on the pleasure you must take in being admir'd in your own Country, which so seldom hap∣pens to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<PB N="121" REF="120"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are Master of an Art that must prosper and grow rich, as long as people love, or are proud of themselves, or their own persons. However, you have stay'd long enough, me∣thinks, to have painted all the numberless Histories of old <HI>Ogygiae.</HI> If you have begun to be Historical, I recommend to your hand the story which every pious <HI>Irishman</HI> ought to begin with, that of St. <HI>Patrick:</HI> To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. <HI>P.</HI> was, when he translated the <HI>Batrachomuo∣machia)</HI> to come into <HI>England</HI> to copy the Frogs, and such other Vermine as were ne∣ver seen in that land since the time of that Confessor.</P>
<P>I long to see you a History Painter. You have already done enough for the Private, do something for the Publick; and be not confined, like the rest, to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us. The Ancients too expect you should do them right; those Statues from which you learn'd your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the ac∣count you intend to write of their <HI>Charac∣ters.</HI> I hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble design.</P>
<P>As to your enquiry about your House, when I come within the walls, they put
<PB N="122" REF="121"/>
me in mind of those of <HI>Carthage,</HI> where your Friend, like the wandring <HI>Trojan,</HI>

For the spacious Mansion, like a <HI>Turkish</HI> Caravanserah, entertains the Vagabond with only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your Pictures about the Town. See what it is to have a Poet in your House! <HI>Frank</HI> in∣deed does all he can in such a Circumstance, for considering he has a wild Beast in it, he constantly keeps the Door chain'd. Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle, the rusty Hinges roar, the House seems so sensible that you are its support, that it is ready to drop in your Absence; but I still trust myself under its Roof, as depend∣ing that Providence will preserve so many <HI>Raphaels, Titian's</HI> and <HI>Guido's,</HI> as are lodg'd in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one Poet can hardly be so heavy, as to bring an old House over the Heads of so many Painters. In a word, your House is fal∣ling, but what of that? I am only a Lodger.</P>

<P>LAST post brought me the favour of your letter of the 10th <HI>Aug. O.

The proof I can give you of my sincerity in this Opinion, is, that I hope and desire you would not stop at this, but continue more of them.</P>
<P>I am in a place where Pleasure is con∣tinually flowing. The Princes set the Ex∣ample, and the Subjects follow at a distance. The Ladies are of all parties, by which means the conversation of the Men is very much softened and fashioned from those blunt disputes on Politicks, and rough Jests, we are so guilty of; while the Freedom of the Women takes away all Formality and Constraint. I must own, at the same time, these Beauties are a little too artificial for my Taste; you have seen a <HI>French</HI> Picture, the Original is more painted, and such a crust of Powder and essence in their Hair, that you can see no difference between

<P>I am surpriz'd to find I have wrote so much Scandal; I fancy I am either setting up for a Wit, or imagine I must Write in this Style to a Wit; I hope you'll prove a good natured one, and not only let me hear from you sometimes, but forgive the small Encouragement you meet with.

<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a Letter, but was discouraged for want of something that I could think worth sending fifteen hundred Miles. <HI>Italy</HI> is such an exhausted Subject, that, I dare say, you'd easily forgive my saying nothing of it; and the imagination of a Poet, is a thing so nice and delicate, that it is no easy matter to find out Images capable of giving Pleasure to one of the few, who (in any Age) have come up to that Character. I am nevertheless lately return'd from an Island, where I passed three or four Months, which, were it set out in its true Colours, might methinks amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The Island <HI>Inarime,</HI> is an Epitome of the whole Earth, containing within the compass of eighteen Miles, a wonderful variety of Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains, and barren Mountains, all thrown together in a most romantic Confusion. The Air is
<PB N="126" REF="125"/>
in the hottest Season, constantly refreshed by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales produce excellent Wheat and <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, but are mostly covered with Vineyards, in∣termixt with Fruit-trees. Besides the com∣mon kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Pea∣ches, &amp;c. they produce Oranges, Limes, Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Me∣lons, and many other Fruits unknown to our Climates, which lie every where open to the Passenger. The Hills are the greater part covered to the top with Vines, some with Chesnut Groves, and others with thickets of Myrtle and Lentiscus. The Fields in the Northern side are divided by hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Fountains and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land∣scape, which is likewise set off by the va∣riety of some barren Spots, and naked Rocks. But that which crowns the Scene, is a large Mountain, rising out of the middle of the Island (once a terrible <HI>Volcano,</HI> by the An∣cients called <HI>Mons Epomeus)</HI> its lower parts are adorned with Vines, and other Fruits, the middle affords Pasture to flocks of Goats and Sheep, and the top is a sandy pointed Rock, from which you have the finest Pro∣spect in the World, surveying at one view, besides several pleasant Islands lying at your Feet, a tract of <HI>Italy</HI> about three hundred Miles in length, from the Promontory of
<PB N="127" REF="126"/>
<HI>Antium,</HI> to the Cape of <HI>Palinurus.</HI> The greater part of which, hath been sung by <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> as making a considerable part of the Travels and Adventures of their two Heroes. The Islands <HI>Caprea, Prochyta,</HI> and <HI>Parthenope,</HI> together with <HI>Cajeta, Cumae, Monte Miseno,</HI> the Habitations of <HI>Circe,</HI> the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and the <HI>Lestrygones,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Promontory of <HI>Minerva,</HI> and the whole <HI>Campagnia felice,</HI> make but a part of this noble Landscape; which would demand an Imagination as warm, and num∣bers as flowing as your own, to describe it. The Inhabitants of this delicious Isle, as they are without Riches and Honours, so are they without the Vices and Follies that attend them; and were they but as much strangers to Revenge, as they are to Ava∣rice or Ambition, they might in fact answer the poetical Notions of the Golden Age. But they have got, as an alloy to their Hap∣diness, an ill habit of murdering one another on slight Offences. We had an Instance of this the second Night after our Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being shot dead by our Door: And yet by the sole secret of minding our own Business, we found a means of living securely among these dangerous People. Would you know how we pass the time at <HI>Naples?</HI> Our chief En∣tertainment is the Devotion of our Neigh∣bours.
<PB N="128" REF="127"/>
Besides the gayety of their Churches (where Folks go to see what they call <HI>una bella Devotione</HI> (i. e.) a sort of Religious Opera) they make Fireworks almost every Week, out of Devotion; the Streets are often hung with Arras, out of Devotion; and (what is still more strange) the Ladies invite Gentlemen to their Houses, and treat them with Musick and Sweetmeats, out of Devotion; in a word, were it not for this Devotion of its Inhabitants, <HI>Naples</HI> would have little else to recommend it, beside the Air and Situation. Learning is in no very thriving state here, as indeed no where else in <HI>Italy.</HI> However, among many pretenders, some Men of taste are to be met with. A Friend of mine told me not long since, that being to visit <HI>Salvini</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> he found him reading your <HI>Homer.</HI> He liked the Notes extreamly, and could find no other fault with the Version, but that he thought it approached too near a Paraphrase; which shews him not to be sufficiently ac∣quainted with our Language. I wish you Health to go on with that noble Work, and when you have that, I need not wish your Success.

<P>THE old project of a Window in the bosom, to render the Soul of Man visible, is what every honest friend has manifold reason to wish for; yet even that would not do in our case, while you are so far separated from me, and so long. I be∣gin to fear you'll die in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Denunciation will be fulfilled upon you, <HI>Hibernus es, &amp; in Hiberniam reverteris</HI>—I shou'd be apt to think you in <HI>Sancho</HI>'s case; some Duke has made you Governor of an Island, or wet place, and you are ad∣ministring Laws to the wild <HI>Irish.</HI> But I must own, when you talk of <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Planting,</HI> you touch my String; and I am as apt to pardon you, as the Fellow that thought himself <HI>Jupiter</HI> would have par∣don'd the other Madman who call'd him∣self his Brother <HI>Neptune.</HI> Alas Sir, do you know whom you talk to? One that had been a Poet, was degraded to a Transla∣tor, and at last thro' meer dulness is turn'd an Architect.

<PB N="130" REF="129"/>
<HI>to surprize</HI> (as <HI>Bays</HI> says.) The next you may expect to hear, is that I am in Debt.</P>
<P>The History of my Transplantation and Settlement which you desire, would require a Volume, were I to enumerate the many projects, difficulties, vicissitudes, and various fates attending that important part of my Life: Much more, should I describe the many Draughts, Elevations, Profiles, Perspectives, &amp;c. of every Palace and Gar∣den propos'd, intended, and happily raised, by the strength of that Faculty wherein all great Genius's excel, Imagination. At last, the Gods and Fate have fix'd me on the borders of the <HI>Thames,</HI> in the Districts of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Twickenham.</HI> It is here I have past an entire Year of my life, without any fix'd abode in <HI>London,</HI> or more than casting a transitory glance (for a day or two at most in a Month) on the pomps of the Town. It is here I hope to receive you, Sir, return'd in triumph from Eternizing the <HI>Ireland</HI> of <HI>this Age.</HI> For you my Structures rise; for you my Colonades extend their Wings; for you my Groves aspire, and Roses bloom. And to say truth, I hope Posterity (which no doubt will be made acquainted with all these things) will look upon it as one of the principal Motives of my Architecture, that it was a Mansion prepar'd to receive you, against your own
<PB N="131" REF="130"/>
should fall to dust, which is destin'd to be the Tomb of poor—and—and the immortal Monument of the Fidelity of two such Servants, who have excell'd in Con∣stancy the very Rats of your Family.</P>
<P>What more can I tell you of myself? so much, and yet all put together so little, that I scarce care, or know, how to do it. But the very reasons that are against putting it upon Paper, are as strong for telling it you in Person; and I am uneasy to be so long de∣ny'd the satisfaction of it.</P>
<P>At present I consider you bound in by the <HI>Irish</HI> Sea, like the Ghosts in <HI>Virgil,</HI>

whose Memory I am erecting the best Mo∣nument I can. What he gave me to publish, was but a small part of what he left behind him, but it was the best, and I will not make it worse by enlarging it.

Yet I have not neglected my Devoirs to Mr. <HI>Rowe;</HI> I am writing this very day his Epitaph for <HI>Westminster-Abbey</HI>—After these, the best natur'd of Men, Sir <HI>Samuel Garth,</HI> has left me in the truest concern for his loss. His Death was very Heroical, and yet unaffected enough to have made a Saint, or a Philosopher fa∣mous: But ill Tongues, and worse Hearts have branded even his last Moments, as wrongfully as they did his Life, with Ir∣religion. You must have heard many Tales on this Subject; but if ever there was a good Christian without knowing himself to be so, it was Dr. <HI>Garth.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had pleas'd myself sooner in writing to you, but that I have been your Suc∣cessor in a Fit of Sickness, and am not yet so much recovered, but that I have thoughts of using your <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Asses.</NOTE>Physicians. They are as grave Persons as any of the Faculty, and (like the Antients) carry their own Medi∣caments about with them.

I am glad you are so much in a better state of Health, as to allow me to jest about it. My concern, when I heard of your Danger, was so very serious, that I almost take it ill Dr. <HI>Evans</HI> should tell you of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly, if you and a few more such people were to leave the World, I would not give six-pence to stay in it.</P>
<P>I am not so much concern'd as to the point, whether you are to live fat or lean: Most Men of Wit or Honesty are usually decreed to live very lean; so I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you shall: However be comforted, and reflect that you'll make the better Busto for it.</P>
<P>'Tis something particular in you, not to be satisfied with sending me your own Books, but to make your Acquaintance continue the frolick. Mr. <HI>Wharton</HI> forc'd me to take <HI>Gorboduc,</HI> which has since done me great credit with several people, as it has done <HI>Dryden</HI> and <HI>Oldham</HI> some dis∣kindness, in shewing there is as much diffe∣rence between their <HI>Gorbuduc,</HI> and this, as between Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> and King <HI>George.</HI> It is truly a scandal, that Men should write with contempt of a Piece which they never once saw, as those two Poets did, who were ignorant even of the Sex, as well as Sense, of <HI>Gorboduc.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO convince you how little pain I give myself, in corresponding with Men of good Nature, and good Understand∣ing, you see I omit to answer your Letters till a time, when another man would be ashamed to own he had received them. If
<PB N="136" REF="136"/>
therefore you are ever moved on my ac∣count by that Spirit, which I take to be as familiar to you as a Quotidian Ague, I mean the Spirit of Goodness, pray never stint it, in any fear of obliging me to a Ci∣vility beyond my natural Inclination: I dare trust you, Sir, not only with my Folly when I write, but with my Negligence when I do not; and expect equally your pardon for either.</P>
<P>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the rest of this Paper, it should be spotted and diversified with Conceits all over; you should be put out of breath with Laughter at each Sentence, and pause at each Period, to look back over how much Wit you had pass'd. But I have found by experience, that people now-adays regard Writing as little as they do Preaching: The most we can hope is to be heard, just with Decency and Patience, once a week, by Folks in the Country: Here in Town we hum over a piece of fine Writing, and we whistle at a Sermon. The Stage is the only place we seem alive at; there indeed we stare, and roar, and clap hands for K. <HI>George</HI> and the Government. As for all other Virtues but this Loyalty, they are an obsolete Train, so ill-dress'd, that Men, Women, and Chil∣dren hiss 'em out of all good Company. Humility knocks so sneakingly at the door,
<PB N="137" REF="137"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes it give way to the free Entrance of Pride, Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> from having rusti∣cated in your Company too long, really behaves herself scandalously among us: She pretends to open her eyes for the sake of seeing the Sun, and to sleep because it is Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn∣ing, and is thought to have said her Prayers before; talks without any manner of shame of good Books, and has not seen <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Play of the <HI>Non-juror.</HI> I rejoyced the other day to see a Libel on her Toilette, which gives me some hope that you have at least a Taste of Scandal left you, in defect of all other Vices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wish you well; but as I cannot entirely desire the ruin of all the Joys of this City, so all that remains is to wish you wou'd keep your Happiness to yourselves, that the happiest here may not die with Envy at a Bliss which they cannot attain to.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU'LL think me very full of my self, when after a long Silence (which
<PB N="138" REF="138"/>
however to say truth has rather been em∣ploy'd to contemplate of you, than to for∣get you I begin to talk of my own Works. I find it is in the Finishing a Book, as in concluding a Session of Parliament, one al∣ways thinks it will be very soon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd-for Incidents to retard the Clearing <HI>any publick Account,</HI> and so I see it is in mine. I have plagued my self, like great Ministers, with undertaking too much for one Man, and with a Desire of doing more than was expect∣ed from me, have done less than I ought.</P>
<P>For having design'd Four very laborious and uncommon sorts of Indexes to <HI>Homer,</HI> I'm forc'd, for want of time, to publish two only; the design of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully exe∣cuted. I've also been oblig'd to leave un∣finish'd in my desk the Heads of two Essays, one on the <HI>Theology</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> and another on the <HI>Oratory</HI> of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> So they must wait for future Edi∣tions, or perish; and (one way or other, no great matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI></P>
<P>I think of you every day, I assure you, even without such good Memorials of you as your Sisters, with whom I sometimes talk of you, and find it one of the most agree∣able of all subjects to them. My Lord
<PB N="139" REF="139"/>
<HI>Digby</HI> must be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his Chil∣dren. There needs no more than an ac∣quaintance with your Family, to make all Elder Sons wish they had Fathers to their lives end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the subject of filial Love, without putting you in mind of an old Woman, who has a sincere, hearty, old∣fashion'd respect for you, and constantly blames her Son for not having writ to you oftner, to tell you so.</P>
<P>I very much wish (but what signifies my wishing? my Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> wishes, your Sisters wish) that you were with us, to com∣pare the beautiful Contraste this Season affords us, of the Town and the Country. No Ideas you could form in the Winter can make you imagine what <HI>Twickenham</HI> is (and what your Friend Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> of <HI>Twickenham</HI> is) in this warmer Season. Our River glitters beneath an unclouded Sun, at the same time that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers: Our Gardens are offering their first Nosegays; our Trees, like new Acquaintance brought happily together, are stretching their Arms to meet each other, and growing nearer and nearer every hour: The Birds are paying their thanksgiving Songs for the new Ha∣bitations I have made 'em: My Building rises high enough to attract the eye and
<PB N="140" REF="140"/>
curiosity of the Passenger from the River, where, upon beholding a mixture of Beauty and Ruin, he enquires what house is falling, or what Church is rising? So little taste have our common Tritons of <HI>Vitruvius;</HI> whatever delight the true, unseen, poetical Gods of the River may take, in reflecting on their Streams my <HI>Tuscan</HI> Porticos, or <HI>Ionic</HI> Pilasters.</P>
<P>But (to descend from all this Pomp of Style) the best account I can give of what I am building, is, that it will afford me a few pleasant Rooms for such a Friend as yourself, or a cool situation for an hour or two for Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> when she will do me the honour (at this Publick House on the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</P>
<P>The moment I am writing this, I am surprized with the account of the Death of a Friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talking of, a meer Jest! Build∣ings, Gardens, Writings, Pleasures, Works, of whatever stuff Man can raise! none of them (God knows) capable of advantaging a Creature that is Mortal, or of satisfying a Soul that is Immortal!

Nor should I have seem'd an un∣concern'd party in the Joys of your family, which I heard of from Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> whose short <HI>Eschantillon</HI> of a Letter (of a quarter of a page) I value as the short Glimpse of a Vision afforded to some de∣vout Hermit; for it includes (as those Re∣velations do) a promise of a better Life in the Elysian Groves of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> whither, I could almost say in the style of a Sermon, the <HI>Lord bring us all, &amp;c.</HI> Thi∣ther may we tend, by various ways to one blissful Bower: Thither may Health, Peace, and Good Humour, wait upon us as Associ∣ates: Thither may whole Cargoes of Nec∣tar (Liquor of Life and Longaevity!) by mortals call'd <HI>Spaw-water,</HI> be convey'd, and there (as <HI>Milton</HI> has it) may we, like the Deities,

<P>Turn your Eyes and Attention from this miserable mercenary Period; and turn yourself, in a just Contempt of these Sons of Mammon, to the Contemplation of Books, Gardens, and Marriage. In which I now leave you, and return (Wretch that I am!) to Water-gruel and <HI>Palladio.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Doctor is going to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and stays a Fortnight or more: Per∣haps you would be comforted to have a Sight of him, whether you need him or not. I think him as good a Doctor as any for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than any for one that is well. He would do admirably for Mrs. <HI>Mary Digby:</HI> She needed only to follow his Hints, to be in eternal business and amusement of mind, and even as active as she could desire. But indeed I fear she would out-walk him: For (as Dean <HI>Swift</HI> observ'd to me the very first time I saw the Doctor) <HI>He is a Man that can do every thing, but walk.</HI> His Brother, who is lately come into <HI>England,</HI> goes also to the <HI>Bath;</HI> and is a more extraordinary Man than he, worth your going thither on purpose to know him. The Spirit of <HI>Philanthropy,</HI> so long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him: He is a Philosopher all of fire; so warmly, nay so wildly in the right, that he forces all others about him to be so too, and draws them into his own <HI>Vortex.</HI> He is a Star that
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Benig∣nity, all gentle and beneficial Influence. If there be other men in the world that would serve a Friend, yet He is the only one I believe that could make even an Enemy serve a Friend.</P>
<P>As all human Life is chequer'd and mixed with Acquisitions and Losses (tho' the latter are more certain and irremediable, than the former lasting or satisfactory) so at the time I have gain'd the acquaintance of one wor∣thy Man I have lost another, a very easy, humane, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr. <HI>Stonor.</HI> It's certain the Loss of one of this Character puts us naturally upon setting a greater Value on the few that are left, tho' the degree of our Esteem may be different. Nothing, says <HI>Seneca,</HI> is so melancholy a circumstance in human life, or so soon re∣conciles us to the thought of our own death, as the reflection and prospect of one Friend after another dropping round us! Who would stand alone, the sole remaining Ruin, the last tottering Column of all the Fabrick of Friendship; once so large, seemingly so strong, and yet so suddenly sunk and buried?</P>

<P>I Have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family, to think you will all be pleas'd that I am arriv'd in safety at <HI>Twickenham;</HI> tho' 'tis a sort of Earnest, that you will be troubled again with me at <HI>Sher∣borne,</HI> or <HI>Coleshill;</HI> for however I may like One of your places, it may be in that as in liking One of your family; when one sees the rest, one likes them all. Pray make my services acceptable to them; I wish them all the happiness they may want, and the con∣tinuance of all the happiness they have; and I take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former. I must separate Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> from you, as I fear she will do herself, before this letter reaches you: So I wish her a good journey, and I hope one day to try if she lives as well as You do; tho' I much question if she can live as quiet∣ly: I suspect the Bells will be ringing at her arrival, and on her own and Miss <HI>Scudamore</HI>'s birthdays, and that all the Clergy in the County come to pay respects; both the Cler∣gy and their Bells expecting from her, and
<PB N="146" REF="146"/>
from the young Lady, further business, and further employment.

<P>I beg my Lord <HI>Digby</HI> to think me a better Man than to content myself with thanking him in the common way. I am in as sincere a sense of the word, His Servant, as you are his Son, or he your Father.</P>
<P>I must in my turn insist upon hearing how my last fellow-travellers got home from <HI>Cla∣rendon,</HI> and desire Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> to remember me in his Cyder, and to tell Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> that I am dead and buried.</P>

<P>YOUR making a sort of Apology for your not writing, is a very genteel reproof to me. I know I was to blame, but I know I did not intend to be so, and (what is the happiest Knowledge in the World) I know you will forgive me: For sure nothing is more satisfactory than to be certain of such a Friend as will overlook one's failings, since every such instance is a Conviction of his Kindness.</P>
<P>If I am all my life to dwell in In∣tentions, and never to rise to Actions, I have but too much need of that gentle disposi∣tion which I experience in you. But I hope better things of myself, and fully purpose to make you a visit this Summer at <HI>Sher∣bourn.</HI> I'm told you are all upon removal very speedily, and that Mrs. <HI>Mary Digby</HI> talks in a Letter to Lady <HI>Scudamore,</HI> of seeing my Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI>'s Wood in her way. How much I wish to be her Guide thro' that enchanted Forest, is not to be exprest: I look upon myself as the Magi∣cian appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the Recesses of those sacred Shades. I could pass whole Days, in only describing to
<PB N="148" REF="148"/>
her the future, and as yet visionary Beau∣ties, that are to rise in those Scenes: The Palace that is to be built, the Pa∣villions that are to glitter, the Colonnades that are to adorn them: Nay more, the meeting of the <HI>Thames</HI> and the <HI>Severn,</HI> which (when the noble Owner has finer Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's Embraces thro' secret Caverns of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till they rise and openly celebrate their Mar∣riage in the midst of an immense Amphi∣theatre, which is to be the Admiration of Posterity a hundred Years hence. But till the destin'd time shall arrive that is to manifest these Wonders, Mrs. <HI>Digby</HI> must content herself with seeing what is at present no more than the finest Wood in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different Na∣ture. Women of Quality are all turn'd Followers of the <HI>Camp</HI> in <HI>Hyde-Park</HI> this Year, whither all the Town resort to magnificent Entertainments given by the Officers, &amp;c. The <HI>Scythian</HI> Ladies that dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not more closely attached to the Luggage. The Matrons, like those of <HI>Sparta,</HI> attend their Sons to the Field, to be the Witnesses of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens
<PB N="149" REF="149"/>
with all their Charms display'd, provoke the Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee sup∣ply the place of <HI>Lacedemonian</HI> black Broth. This Camp seems crowned with perpetual Victory, for every Sun that rises in the Thunder of Cannon, sets in the Musick of Violins. Nothing is yet wanting but the constant presence of the <HI>Princess,</HI> to represent the <HI>Mater Exercitûs.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Twickenham</HI> the World goes other∣wise. There are certain old People who take up all my time, and will hardly al∣low me to keep any other Company. They were introduced here by a Man of their own sort, who has made me perfectly rude to all my Contemporaries, and won't so much as suffer me to look upon 'em. The Person I complain of is the Bishop of <HI>Rochester.</HI> Yet he allows me (from some∣thing he has heard of your Character and that of your Family, as if you were of the old Sect of Moralists) to write three or four sides of Paper to you, and to tell you (what these sort of People never tell but with Truth, and religious Sincerity) that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<P>THE same reason that hinder'd your writing, hinder'd mine, the pleasing Expectation to see you in Town. Indeed since the willing Confinement I have lain under here with my Mother, (whom it is natural and reasonable I should rejoice with as well as grieve) I could the better bear your Absence from <HI>London,</HI> for I could hardly have seen you there; and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick Room hither from the first Embraces of your Friends. My Mother is now (I thank God) wonderfully recovered, tho' not so much as yet to venture out of her Chamber, yet enough to enjoy a few particular Friends, when they have the good Nature to look upon her. I may recom∣mend to you the Room we sit in, upon one (and that a favourite) Account, that it is the very <HI>warmest</HI> in the House: We and our Fires will equally smile upon your Face. There is a <HI>Persian</HI> Proverb that says, I think very prettily, <HI>The Conversation of a Friend brightens the Eyes.</HI> This I take to be a

Splendor still more agreeable than the Fires you so delightfully describe.</P>
<P>That you may long enjoy your own Fire∣side, in the metaphorical Sense, that is, all those of your Family who make it pleasing to sit and spend whole wintry Months to∣gether, (a far more rational Delight, and better felt by an honest Heart, than all the glaring Entertainments, numerous Lights, and false Splendors, of an <HI>Assembly</HI> of empty Heads, aking Hearts, and false Faces) This is my sincere Wish to you and yours.</P>
<P>You say you propose much Pleasure in seeing some few <HI>Faces</HI> about Town of my Acquaintance, I guess you mean Mrs. <HI>How∣ard</HI>'s and Mrs. <HI>Blount</HI>'s.

<P>A Fever carry'd me on the high Gallop towards it for six or seven days—But here you have me now, and that's all I shall say of it: Since which time an impertinent Lameness kept me at home twice as long; as if Fate should say (after the other danger∣ous Illness) <Q REND="inline">"You shall neither go into the other World, nor any where you like in this."</Q> Else who knows but I had been at <HI>Hom-lacy?</HI></P>

<P>I AM glad your Travels delighted you, improve you I am sure they could not; you are not so much a Youth as that, tho' you run about with a King of Sixteen, and
<PB N="158" REF="158"/>
(what makes him still more a Child) a King of <HI>French-men.</HI> My own Time has been more melancholy, spent in an Attendance upon Death, which has seized one of our Family, my poor old Nurse. My Mother is something better, though at her advanc'd Age every Day is a Climacterick. There was join'd to this an Indisposition of my own, which I ought to look upon as a slight one, compar'd with my Mother's, (because my Life is not of half the Consequence to any Body, that hers is to me). All these Inci∣dents have hinder'd my more speedy Reply to your obliging Letter.</P>
<P>The Article you enquire of, is of as little Concern to me as you desire it shou'd; namely the Railing Papers about the <HI>Odyssey.</HI> If the Book has Merit, (and since you like it, it must) it will extinguish all such nasty Scan∣dal, as the Sun puts an end to stinks, meerly by <HI>coming out.</HI></P>
<P>I wish I had nothing to trouble me more; an honest Mind is not in the power of any dishonest one: To break its Peace, there must be some Guilt or Consciousness, which is inconsistent with its own Principles. Not but Malice and Injustice have their Day, like some poor short-liv'd Vermine, that die of shooting their own Stings. <HI>Falshood is Folly</HI> (says <HI>Homer),</HI> and Liers and Calumni∣ators at last hurt none but themselves, even
<PB N="159" REF="159"/>
in this World: In the next, 'tis Charity to say, God have Mercy on them! They were the Devil's Vice-gerents upon Earth, who is the Father of Lies, and I fear has a Right to dispose of his Children.</P>
<P>I've had an Occasion to make these Re∣flections of late, more justly than from any thing that concerns my Writings, for it is one that concerns my Morals, and (which I ought to be as tender of as my own) the good Character of another very innocent Person, who I'm sure shares your Friendship no less than I do. **** No Creature has better natural Dispositions, or would act more rightly, or reasonably, in every Duty, did she act by herself, or from herself: But you know 'tis the Misfortune of that Fa∣mily to be govern'd like a Ship, I mean the Head guided by the Tail, and that by every Wind that blows in it.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now the Season to wish you a good End of one Year, and a happy Beginning of another: but both these you know how to make yourself, by only continuing such
<PB N="160" REF="160"/>
a Life as you have been long accustomed to lead. As for Good Works, they are things I dare not name, either to those that do them, or to those that do them not; the first are too modest, and the latter too selfish, to bear the mention of what are become either too old-fashion'd, or too private, to consti∣tute any Part of the Vanity or Reputation of the present Age. However, it were to be wish'd People would now and then look upon Good Works as they do upon old Wardrobes, meerly in case any of'em should by chance come into Fashion again; as an∣cient Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd Petticoats, (which may be properly compar'd to Charities, as they cover a multitude of Sins.)</P>
<P>They tell me that at—certain anti∣quated Charities, and obsolete Devotions are yet subsisting: That a thing called Christian Chearfulness, (not incompatible with <HI>Christ∣mas</HI> Pyes and Plum-broth) whereof frequent is the mention in old Sermons and Alma∣nacks, is really kept alive and in Practise: That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good House-keeping, in a Latitude not more re∣mote from <HI>London</HI> than fourscore Miles: And lastly, that Prayers and Roast-beef actually make some People as happy, as a Whore and a Bottle. But here in Town
<PB N="161" REF="161"/>
I assure you, Men, Women, and Children have done with these things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home. Instead of the four Cardinal Virtues, now reign four Princely ones: We have Cunning for Pru∣dence, Rapine for Justice, Time-serving for Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance. Whatever you may fancy where you live in a State of Ignorance, and see nothing but Quiet, Religion and Good Humour, the Case is just as I tell you where People under∣stand the World, and know how to live with Credit and Glory.</P>
<P>I wish that Heaven would open the Eyes of Men, and make 'em sensible <HI>which</HI> of these is right: Whether upon a due Conviction, we are to quit Faction, and Gaming, and High-feeding and Whoring, and take to your Country Way? or you to leave Prayers, and Almsgiving, and Read∣ing and Exercise, and come into our Mea∣sures? I wish (I say) that this Matter were as clear to all Men, as it is to</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<P>I Know of nothing that will be so Inte∣ressing to you at present, as some cir∣cumstances of the last Act of that eminent Comick Poet, and our Friend, <HI>Wycherley.</HI> He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would Marry as soon as his life was despair'd of. Accord∣ingly a few days before his Death he un∣derwent the Ceremony; and join'd together those two Sacraments which wise Men say should be the last we receive; For if you ob∣serve, Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<PB N="166" REF="164"/>
Unction in our Catechism, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they are to be taken. The old Man then lay down, satisfy'd in the Conscience of having, by this one Act paid his just Debts, obliged a Woman who (he was told had) Merit, and shewn an heroick resentment of the ill usage of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, discharg∣ed those Debts; a Jointure of four hundred a year made her a Recompense; and the Nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could, with the miserable Remains of a mortgaged Estate. I saw our Friend twice after this was done, less peevish in his Sickness than he used to be in his Health; neither much afraid of Dying, nor (which in him had been more likely) much ashamed of Marrying. The Evening before he ex∣pired, he called his young Wife to the bed side, and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request, the last he should make. Upon her Assurances of consenting to it, he told her, <HI>My Dear, it is only this; that you will never marry an old Man again.</HI> I can∣not help remarking, that Sickness which often destroys both Wit and Wisdom, yet seldom has power to remove that Talent which we call <HI>Humour:</HI> Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> shew'd his, even in this last Compliment; tho' I think his request a little hard; for
<PB N="167" REF="165"/>
why should he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the same easy Terms?</P>
<P>So trivial as these Circumstances are, I should not be displeas'd my self to know such Trifles, when they concern or charac∣terise any eminent Person. The wisest and wittiest of Men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these sober Moments. At least, our Friend ended much in the Character he had lived in: And <HI>Horace</HI>'s Rule for a Play, may as well be apply'd to him as a Playwright,

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am just return'd from the Country, whither Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> accompanied me, and pass'd a Week in the Forest. I need not tell you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd me; but I must acquaint you there is a Vi∣vacity and Gaiety of Disposition almost pe∣culiar to him, which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which
<PB N="168" REF="166"/>
generally succeeds all our pleasures. I have been just taking a solitary walk by Moon∣shine, full of reflections on the transitory na∣ture of all human delights; and giving my Thoughts a loose in the contemplation of those Satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the Company of separate Spirits, when we shall range the Walks a∣bove, and perhaps gaze on this World at as vast a distance as we now do on those Worlds. The pleasures we are to enjoy in that Conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro∣ceed from the Discoveries each shall commu∣nicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the Happiness of Minds can surely be nothing but Knowledge.</P>
<P>The highest Gratification we receive here from Company is <HI>Mirth,</HI> which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that beats about the breast for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty.</P>
<P>Keeping good Company, even the best, is but a less shameful Art of losing Time.</P>
<P>What we here call <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> are little better: The greater number of Arts to which we apply ourselves are mere Grop∣ing in the Dark; and even the search of our most important Concerns in a future being, is but a needless, anxious, and uncertain haste to be knowing, sooner than we can,
<PB N="169" REF="167"/>
what without all this sollicitude we shall know a little later. We are but <HI>Curious Impertinents</HI> in the case of Futurity. 'Tis not our business to be guessing what the State of Souls shall be, but to be doing what may make our own State happy; We cannot be Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my Notion of a great part of that high Science, Divinity; you will be so civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stress up∣on the rest. Even of my darling Poetry I really make no other use, than Horses of the Bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they toss their Heads as if they were proud of 'em) only to Jogg on a little more merrily.</P>
<P>Your Observations on the narrow concep∣tions of Mankind in the point of Friend∣ship, confirm me in what I was so fortu∣nate as at my first knowledge of you to hope, and since so amply to experience. Let me take so much decent Pride and Dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini∣ons like these, which I discover'd in your Mind, I had never made the Trial I have done; which has succeeded so much to mine, and I believe not less to your Satisfaction: For if I know you right, your Pleasure is greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="168"/>
Your Remark, that the Variety of opini∣on in Politicks or Religion is often rather a Gratification, than Objection, to people who have Sense enough to consider the beau∣tiful order of Nature in her Variations; makes me think you have not construed <HI>Joannes Secundus</HI> wrong, in the Verse which precedes that which you quote: <HI>Bene nota Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way signify the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Religion, tho' <HI>Secundus</HI> was of it. I think it was a generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him, which divided the whole World. I am pretty sure You and I should no more make good <HI>Inquisitors</HI> to the mo∣dern Tyrants in Faith, than we could have been qualify'd for <HI>Lictors</HI> to <HI>Procrustes,</HI> when he converted refractory Members with the Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you what I think I have formerly said; that I as little fear God will damn a Man who has Charity, as I hope that any Priest can save him without it.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE>
<P>I Find that a real concern is not only a Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing too: The more time we give our selves to think over one's own, or a Friends unhappi∣ness, the more unable we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a Letter, at such a Season as this, as to retard a melancholy Visit to a Person one cannot relieve. One is ashamed in that Circumstance, to pretend to entertain people with trifling, insignificant affectations of Sorrow on the one hand, or unseasonable and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things sacred; to treat so solemn a matter as a generous vo∣luntary Suffering, with Compliments or Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as your's has no need of being Spirited up in∣to Honour, or like a weak Woman, Praised into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis enough to do and suffer what we ought; and Men should know, that the noble pow∣er of Suffering bravely is as far above that of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemish'd Conscience and inflexible Resolution are a∣bove
<PB N="172" REF="170"/>
an accidental Flow of Spirits, or a sud∣den Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious Business of Mankind be included in Resigna∣tion to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel∣low Creatures; there are now some People who give us the Opportunity of affording as bright an Example in practising the one, as themselves have given an infamous Instance of the Violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has always this Comfort when he is opprest, that he knows himself to be superior to those who injure him: For the greatest Power on Earth can no sooner do him that Injury, but the brave Man can make himself greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to seek for allevia∣ting Consolations in a Calamity of so much Glory, one might say that to be ruin'd thus in the Gross, with a whole People, is but like perishing in the General Conflagra∣tion, where nothing we can value is lest behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks in our present Condition, the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each others Load, and (opprest as we are) to succour such as are yet more opprest. If there are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give, our Money, there are yet others who may be relieved by our Coun∣sel, by our Countenance, and even by our
<PB N="173" REF="171"/>
Chearfulness. The Misfortunes of private Families, the Misunderstandings of People whom Distresses make suspicious, the Cold∣nesses of Relations whom Change of Religi∣on may dis-unite, or the Necessities of half∣ruin'd Estates render unkind to each other; these at least may be soften'd in some de∣grees, by a general well-manag'd Humanity among ourselves, if all those who have your Principles of Belief, had also your Sense and Conduct. But indeed most of 'em have given lamentable <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <HI>Preston.</HI></NOTE> proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want Sense, are only religious thro' weakness, and good-natur'd thro' Shame: These are narrow-minded Creatures that never deal in Essentials; their Faith never looks be∣yond Ceremonials, nor their Charity be∣yond Relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any distressed, conscientious <HI>French</HI> Refugee at this instant: what must my Concern then be, when I perceive so many Anxieties now tearing those Hearts which I have desired a place in, and Clouds of Melancholy rising on those Faces which I have long look'd upon with Affection? I begin already to feel both what some ap∣prehend, and what others are yet too stu∣pid
<PB N="174" REF="172"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old, for so many additional Inconveniencies, and Chagrins, more than their small Remain of Life seem'd destin'd to undergo; andwith the Young, for so many of those Gayeties and Pleasures (the Portion of Youth) which they will by this means be depriv'd of. This brings into my mind one or other of those I love best, and among them the Widow and Fatherless, late of—As I am certain no People living had an earlier and truer Sense of others Misfortunes, or a more gene∣rous resignation as to what might be their own; so I earnestly wish, that whatever part they must bear may be render'd as sup∣portable to them as it is in the power of any Friend to make it.</P>
<P>But I know you have prevented me in this Thought, as you always will in any thing that's good, or generous: I find by a a Letter of your Lady's (which I have seen) that their Ease and Tranquility is part of your Care. I believe there's some Fata∣lity in it, that you should always, from time to time, be doing those particular things that make me enamour'd of you.</P>
<P>I write this from <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest, of which I am come to take my last look. We here bid our Neighbours adieu, much as those who go to be hang'd do their Fellow-Prisoners, who are condemn'd to follow
<PB N="175" REF="173"/>
them a few weeks after. I parted from honest Mr. <HI>D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> with tenderness; and from old Sir <HI>William Trumball</HI> as from a venerable Prophet, foretelling with lifted hands the Miseries to come, from which he is just going to be remov'd himself.</P>
<P>Perhaps, now I have learnt so far as
<Q><L>—Nos dulcia linquimus arva,</L></Q>
My next Lesson may be
<Q><L>Nos Patriam fugimus—</L></Q></P>
<P>Let that, and all else be as Heaven pleases! I have provided just enough to keep me a Man of Honour. I believe you and I shall never be asham'd of each other. I know I wish my Country well, and if it undoes me, it shall not make me wish it other∣wise.</P>

<P>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private Affairs may plead a lawful Excuse in behalf of a negligent Correspondent, I have really a very good Title to it: I cannot say
<PB N="176" REF="174"/>
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappiness, tha I am obliged at this time to give up my whole Application to <HI>Homer;</HI> when without that Employment, my Thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable, the Violence, Mad∣ness and Resentment of modern War-makers, which are likely to prove (to some People at least) more fatal, than the same Qualities in <HI>Achilles</HI> did to his unfortunate Country∣men.</P>
<P>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life, from <HI>Windsor</HI> Forest to the Side of the <HI>Thames,</HI> be one of the grand <HI>Aera's</HI> of my days, and may be called a notable Period in so inconsiderable a History; yet you can scarce imagine any Hero passing from one Stage of Life to another, with so much Tranquillity, so easy a Transition, and so laudable a Behaviour. I am become so truly a Citizen of the World (according to <HI>Pla∣to</HI>'s Expression) that I look with equal In∣difference on what I have lost, and on what I have gained. The Times and Amusements past are not more like a Dream to me, than those which are present: I lie in a refresh∣ing kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort at least from Obscurity, that the <HI>Darkness</HI> helps me to <HI>sleep</HI> the better. I now and then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my Friends, whom I fancy I remember much as separate Spirits do us, at tender Intervals,
<PB N="177" REF="175"/>
neither interrupting their own Employ∣ments, nor altogether careless of ours: but in general constantly wishing us well, and hoping to have us one day in their Com∣pany.</P>
<P>To grow indifferent to the World is to grow Philosophical, or Religious; (which∣soever of those Turns we chance to take) and indeed the World is such a thing as one that thinks pretty much, must either laugh at, or be angry with: But if we laugh at it, they say we are proud; and if we are angry with it, they say we are ill∣natur'd. So the most politic Way is to seem always better pleas'd than one can be, greater Admirers, greater Lovers, and in short greater Fools, than we really are: So shall we live comfortably with our Fami∣lies, quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd by our Masters, and happy with our Mis∣tresses.

<P>I Think your leaving <HI>England</HI> was like a good Man's leaving the World, with the blessed Conscience of having acted

well in it: And I hope you have received your Reward, in being happy where you are.

<P>But I had a melancholy hint the other day, as if you were yet a Martyr to the fa∣tigue your Virtue made you undergo on this side the Water. I beg if your health be re∣stor'd to you, not to deny me the Joy of knowing it: Your endeavours of Service and good Advices to the poor Papists, put me in mind of <HI>Noah</HI>'s preaching forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last.

<P>If I durst mix prophane with sacred history, I would chear you with the old Tale of <HI>Brutus</HI> the wandering Trojan, who found on that very Coast the happy End of his Peregrinations and Adventures.</P>
<P>I have very lately read <HI>Jeffery</HI> of <HI>Mon∣mouth</HI> (to whom your <HI>Cornwall</HI> is not a little beholden) in the Translation of a Clergyman
<PB N="179" REF="177"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is highly concerned to vindicate <HI>Jeffery</HI>'s vera∣city as an Historian; and told me he was perfectly astonished, we of the <HI>Roman</HI> com∣munion could doubt of the Legends of his Giants, while we believ'd those of our Saints? I am forced to make a fair Composition with him; and, by crediting some of the wonders of <HI>Corinaeus</HI> and <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> have brought him so far already, that he speaks respect∣fully of St. <HI>Christopher</HI>'s carrying Christ, and the Resuscitation of St. <HI>Nicholas Tolentine</HI>'s Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in con∣verting each other from all manner of Infi∣delity.</P>
<P><HI>Ajax</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> are no more; compared to <HI>Corinaeus</HI> and <HI>Arthur,</HI> than the <HI>Guelphs</HI> and <HI>Ghibellines</HI> were to the <HI>Mohocks</HI> of ever∣dreadful memory. This amazing Writer has made me lay aside <HI>Homer</HI> for a week, and when I take him up again, I shall be very well prepared to translate with belief and reverence the Speech of <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Horse.</P>
<P>You'll excuse all this trifling, or any thing else which prevents a Sheet full of Compliment: And believe there is nothing more true (even more true than any thing in <HI>Jeffery</HI> is false) than that I have a con∣stant Affection for you, and am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE Question you proposed to me is what at present I am the most unfit Man in the world to answer, by my Loss of one of the best of Fathers.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="179"/>
He had liv'd in such a Course of Tem∣perance as was enough to make the longest Life agreeable to him, and in such a Course of Piety as suffic'd to make the most sud∣den Death so also. Sudden indeed it was: However, I heartily beg of God to give me such an one, provided I can lead such a Life. I leave him to the Mercy of God, and to the Piety of a Religion that extends beyond the Grave: <HI>Si qua est ea cura,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He has left me to the ticklish Management of a narrow Fortune, where every false Step is dangerous. My Mother is in that dispi∣rited State of Resignation, which is the ef∣fect of long Life, and the Loss of what is dear to us. We are really each of us in want of a Friend, of such an humane Turn as yourself, to make almost any thing desira∣ble to us. I feel your Absence more than ever, at the same time I can less express my Regards to you than ever; and shall make this, which is the most sincere Letter I ever writ to you, the shortest and faintest per∣haps of any you have receiv'd. 'Tis enough if you reflect, that barely to remember any Person, when one's Mind is taken up with a sensible Sorrow, is a great degree of Friendship. I can say no more but that I love you, and all that are yours; and that I wish it may be very long before any of yours shall feel for you what I now feel for my Father.</P>

<P>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this Country ever since your departure. I am pleas'd to date this from a place so well known to Mrs. <HI>Blount,</HI> where I write as if I were dictated by her Ancestors, whose faces are all upon me. I fear none so much as Sir <HI>Christopher Guise,</HI> who be∣ing in his Shirt, seems as ready to combate me, as her own Sir <HI>John</HI> was to demolish Duke <HI>Lancastere.</HI> I dare say your Lady will recollect his Figure. I look'd upon the Mansion, Walls, and Terraces; the Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has made to command a variety of Vallies and rising Woods; with a Veneration mixt with a Pleasure, that represented her to me in those puerile Amusements, which engaged her so many Years ago in this place: I fancy'd I saw her sober over a Sampler, or gay over a joynted Baby. I dare say she did one thing more, even in
<PB N="183" REF="181"/>
those early times; <HI>remember'd her Creator in the Days of her Youth.</HI></P>
<P>You describe so well your Heremitical state of life, that none of the ancient An∣chorites could go beyond you, for a Cave in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of the Accommodations that befit a Solitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of those venerable and holy Persona∣ges took with them a Lady, and begat Sons and Daughters. You must modestly be content to be accounted a Patriarch. But were you a little younger, I should rather rank you with Sir <HI>Amadis,</HI> and his fellows.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR very kind and obliging man∣ner of enquiring after me, among the first concerns of Life, at your Resuscitation, should have been sooner answer'd and ac∣knowledg'd. I sincerely rejoice at your re∣covery from an Illness which gave me less pain than it did you, only from my Igno∣rance of it. I should have else been seri∣ously and deeply affected, in the thought of your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a private Letter of <HI>Montaigne,</HI> giving an account of the last words of an intimate Friend of his: <Q REND="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain I feel will soon be over, but I grieve for
<PB N="185" REF="183"/>
that you are to feel, which is to last you for life.'</Q></P>
<P>I joyn with your Family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy Man some∣what longer. The Comforts you receive from their Attendance put me in mind of what old <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Saltoune</HI> said one day to me. <Q REND="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to dye; I am a poor Individual; no Crea∣ture to wish, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only reason I have to re∣pent being a single Man; now I grow old, I am like a Tree without a Prop, and without young Trees of my own shedding, to grow round me, for Company and De∣fence.'</Q></P>
<P>I hope the Gout will soon go after the Fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an Interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards, except the Gout. Pray come, and never stir from us again. Do away your dirty Acres, cast 'em to dirty People, such as in the Scripture Phrase <HI>possess the Land.</HI> Shake off your Earth like the noble Animal in <HI>Milton,</HI></P>
<Q><L>The tawny Lyon, pawing to get free</L>
<L>His hinder Parts, he springs as broke from Bonds,</L>
<L>And rampant shakes his brinded Main: the Ounce,</L>
<L>The Livard, and the Tiger, as the Mole</L>
<L>Rising, the crumbled Earth above them threw</L>
<L>In Hillocks▪</L></Q>
<P><PB N="186" REF="184"/>
But I believe <HI>Milton</HI> never thought, these fine Verses of his should be apply'd to a Man selling a parcel of dirty Acres; tho' in the main I think it may have some re∣semblance; for God knows this little space of Ground nourishes, buries, and confines us, as that of <HI>Eden</HI> did those Creatures, till we can shake it loose, at least in our Af∣fections and Desires.</P>
<P>Believe, dear Sir, I truly love and value you; let Mrs. <HI>Blount</HI> know that she is in the list of my <HI>Memento Domine's Famulorum Famularumque's,</HI> &amp;c. My poor Mother is far from well, declining; and I am watch∣ing over her, as we watch an expiring Taper, that even when it looks brightest, wastes fastest. I am (as you will see from the whole Air of this Letter) not in the gay∣est nor easiest Humour, but always with Sincerity,</P>

<P>YOU may truly do me the Justice to think no Man is more your sincere well-wisher than myself, or more the sin∣cere
<PB N="187" REF="185"/>
well-wisher of your whole Family; with all which, I cannot deny but I have a mixture of Envy to you all, for loving one another so well; and for enjoying the sweets of that life, which can only be tasted by people of good will.<Q><L>They from all Shades the Darkness can exclude,</L>
<L>And from a Desart banish Solitude.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Torbay</HI> is a Paradise, and a Storm is but an amusement to such people. If you drink Tea upon a Promontory that over∣hangs the Sea, it is preferable to an Assem∣bly; and the whistling of the Wind better Musick to contented and loving Minds, than the Opera to the Spleenful, Ambitious, Dis∣eas'd, Distasted, and Distracted Souls, which this World affords; nay, this World affords no other. Happy they! who are banish'd from us: but happier they, who can banish themselves; or more properly, banish the World from them!<Q><L>Alas! I live at <HI>Twickenham!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I take that Period to be very Sublime, and to include more than a hundred Sentences that might be writ to express Distraction, Hurry, Multiplication of Nothings, and all the fati∣guing perpetual Business of having no Busi∣ness to do. You'll wonder I reckon translating the <HI>Odyssey</HI> as nothing? But whenever I think
<PB N="188" REF="186"/>
seriously (and of late I have met with so many Occasions of thinking seriously, that I begin never to think otherwise) I cannot but think these things very idle; as idle, as if a Beast of Burden shou'd go on jingling his Bells, without bearing any thing valuable about him, or ever serving his Master.<Q><L>Life's vain Amusements, amidst which we dwell;</L>
<L>Not weigh'd, or understood by the grim God of Hell!</L></Q></P>
<P>Said a Heathen Poet; as he is translated by a Christian Bishop, who has, first by his Exhortations, and since by his Example, taught me to <HI>think</HI> as becomes a Reasonable Creature.—But he is gone! He carry'd a∣way more Learning than is left in this Nation behind him: but he left us more in the noble Example of bearing Calamity well. 'Tis true, we want Literature very much; but pray God we don't want Patience more! if these Precedents are to prevail.</P>
<P>I remember I promis'd to write to you, as soon as I should hear you were got home. You must look on this as the first Day I've been myself, and pass over the Mad Interval un-imputed to me. How punctual a Cor∣respondent I shall hence-forward be able, or not able to be, God knows: but he knows I shall ever be a punctual and grate∣ful Friend, and all the good Wishes of such an one will ever attend you.</P>

As to forgetfulness of you or yours, I assure you, the promiscuous Conversations of the Town serve only to put me in mind of bet∣ter, and more quiet, to be had in a Corner of the World (undisturb'd, innocent, serene, and sensible) with such as you. Let no Ac∣cess of any Distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny Weather. Let the young Ladies be assured I make nothing new in my Gardens without wishing to see the print of their Fairy Steps in every part of 'em. I have put the last Hand to my works of this kind, in happily finishing the subter∣raneous Way and Grotto; I there found a Spring of the clearest Water, which falls in a perpetual Rill, that ecchoes thro' the Cavern day and night. From the Ri∣ver <HI>Thames,</HI> you see thro' my Arch up a Walk of the Wilderness to a kind of open
<PB N="190" REF="188"/>
Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the Rustic Manner; and from that distance un∣der the Temple you look down thro' a slop∣ing Arcade of Trees, and see the Sails on the River passing suddenly and vanishing, as thro' a Perspective Glass. When you shut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the instant, from a luminous Room, a <HI>Camera obscura;</HI> on the Walls of which all the Ob∣jects of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture in their visible Radiations: And when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different Scene: it is finished with Shells interspersed with Pieces of Looking-glass in angular forms; and in the Cieling is a Star of the same Ma∣terial, at which when a Lamp (of an orbi∣cular Figure of thin Alabaster) is hung in the Middle, a thousand pointed Rays glitter and are reflected over the Place. There are con∣nected to this Grotto by a narrower Passage two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one toward the River, of smooth Stones, full of light and open; the other toward the Arch of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints and Iron Ore. The Bottom is paved with simple Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil∣derness to the Temple, is to be Cockle-shells, in the natural Taste, agreeing not ill with the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic Idea of the whole Place. It wants nothing
<PB N="191" REF="189"/>
to compleat it but a good Statue with an Inscription, like that beautiful antique one which you know I am so fond of,<Q><L>Hujus Nympha loci, sacri custodia fontis</L>

<L>And to the Murmur of these Waters sleep;</L>
<L>Whoe'er thou art, ah gently tread the Cave,</L>
<L>Ah bathe in silence, or in silence lave.</L></Q></P>
<P>You'll think I have been very Poetical in this Description, but it is pretty near the Truth. I wish you were here to bear Testimony how little it owes to Art, either the Place itself, or the Image I give of it.</P>

<P>I have had a Fever, a short one, but a vi∣olent: I am now well. So it shall take up no more of this Paper.</P>
<P>I begin now to expect you in Town, to make the Winter to come more tolera∣ble to us both. The Summer is a kind of Heaven, when we wander in a Paradisaical Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens; but at this Season, we are like our poor first Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' soli∣tary life, and forc'd to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get in∣to warmer Houses, and hive together in Ci∣ties.</P>
<P>I hope you are long since perfectly restor'd and risen from your Gout, happy in the delights of a contented Family, smiling at

Storms, laughing at Greatness, and merry over a Christmas-fire, exercising all the Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and Hospitality. I will not tell Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> what I think she is doing; for I conclude it is her opinion, that he only ought to know it for whom it is done: and she will allow herself to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady, not to desire to shine before Men.</P>
<P>Your Daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts, which even their Mother must excuse them for, because she is a Mo∣ther. I will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their Devotions, but rather excite 'em, and assist the warmth of them; while their Prayer may be, that they may raise up and breed as irreproach∣able a young Family as their Parents have done. In a Word, I fancy you all well, easy, and happy, just as I wish you; and next to that I wish you all with me.</P>
<P>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in dignity, and next in value. <HI>Minuisti eum paullo minus ab Angelis.</HI> If therefore I wish well to the good and the deserving, and de∣sire They only should be my companions and Correspondents; I must very soon, and very much think of you. I want your Company, and your Example. Pray make haste to Town, so as not again to leave us: Discharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,

<P>IT has been my good fortune within this Month past, to hear more things that have pleas'd me than (I think) al∣most in all my time beside. But nothing upon my word has been so Home-felt a sa∣tisfaction as the News you tell me of your self: and you are not in the least mista∣ken, when you congratulate me upon your own good Success, for I have more People to be happy out of, than any ill-natur'd man can boast. I may with honesty af∣firm to you, that notwithstanding the ma∣ny Inconveniencies and Disadvantages they commonly talk of in the <HI>Res angusti domi,</HI> I have never found any other, than the inability of giving people of Merit the only certain proof of our value for them, in doing 'em some real service. For after all, if we could but Think a little, Self∣love might make us Philosophers, and con∣vince us, <HI>Quantuli indiget Natura!</HI> Our∣selves are easily provided for; 'tis nothing but the Circumstantials, and the Apparatus or Equipage of humane life that costs so much the furnishing.

I must also put you in mind, tho' you are now Secretary to this Lady, that you are likewise Secretary to Nine other Ladies, and are to write sometimes for them too. He who is forc'd to live whol∣ly upon those Ladies favours, is indeed in as precarious a condition as any He who does what <HI>Chaucer</HI> says—for <HI>Sustenance;</HI> but they are very agreeable Companions, like other Ladies, when a Man only passes a Night or so with them at his leisure, and away.

<P>JUST as I receiv'd yours, I was set down to write to you with some shame that I had so long defer'd it. But I can hardly repent my neglect, when it
<PB N="121" REF="198"/>
gives me the knowledge how little you insist upon Ceremony, and how much a greater share in your memory I have than I deserve. I have been near a week in <HI>London,</HI> where I am like to remain, till I become by Mr. <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>s</HI>'s help, <HI>Elegans Forma∣rum Spectator.</HI> I begin to discover Beau∣ties that were till now imperceptible to me. Every Corner of an Eye, or Turn of a Nose or Ear, the smallest degree of Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim∣ple, have charms to distract me. I no lon∣ger look upon Lord <HI>Plausible</HI> as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear and pretty Elbow (as the <HI>Plain-dealer</HI> has it) but am in some danger even from the Ugly and Disagreeable, since they may have their retired beauties, in one Trait or other about 'em. You may guess in how uneasy a state I am, when every day the per∣formances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more despica∣ble. I have thrown away three Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s, each of which was once my Vanity, two Lady <HI>Bridgwaters,</HI> a Dutchess of <HI>Montague,</HI> besides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight of the Garter. I have crucify'd <HI>Christ</HI> over-again in effigie, and made a <HI>Madona</HI> as old as her mother St. <HI>Anne.</HI> Nay, what is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd St. <HI>Luke</HI> himself in Painting, and as 'tis said
<PB N="122" REF="199"/>
an Angel came and finish'd his Piece, so you would swear a Devil put the last hand to mine, 'tis so begrim'd and smut∣ted. However I comfort my self with a christian Reflection, that, I have not broken the Commandment, for my Pi∣ctures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the waters under the earth. Neither will any body adore or worship them, except the <HI>Indians</HI> should have a sight of 'em, who they tell us, worship certain Pagods or Idols purely for their Ugliness.</P>
<P>I am very much recreated and refreshed with the News of the Advancement of the <HI>Fan,</HI> which I doubt not will delight the Eye and Sense of the Fair, as long as that agreeable Machine shall play in the Hands of Posterity. I am glad your <HI>Fan</HI> is mount∣ed so soon, but I wou'd have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure, and polish the Sticks as much as you can. You may then cause it to be born in the Lands of both Sexes, no less in <HI>Britain,</HI> than it is in <HI>China;</HI> where it is ordinary for a <HI>Mandarine</HI> to fan himself cool after a Debate, and a States∣man to hide his face with it when he tells a grave Lye.</P>

<P>SINCE by your letter we find you can be content to breath in smoak, to walk in crouds, and divert your self with noise, nay and to make fine Pictures of this way of life, we shou'd give you up as one aban∣doned to a wrong choice of pleasures.

As we rise in our speculations daily, we are grown so grave, that we have not con∣descended to laugh at any of the idle things about us this week: I have contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation on high subjects, equal to the formidable Front of black-brow'd <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and become an awful Nod as well, when I assent to some grave and weighty Proposition of the Do∣ctor, or enforce a Criticism of my own.

This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month. But they had reasons too themselves to al∣ledge in your excuse, as men who really value one another will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy. The late universal Concern in publick af∣fairs, threw us all into a hurry of Spirits; even I who am more a Philosopher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was born away with the current, and full of the expectation of the Successor: During your Journeys I knew not whither to aim

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM extremely glad to find by a Let∣ter of yours to Mr. <HI>Fortescue,</HI> that you have receiv'd one from me; and I beg you to keep, as the greatest of Curiosities, that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and I never writ.</P>
<P>But the Truth is, that we were made here to expect you in a short time, that I was upon the Ramble most part of the Summer, and have concluded the Season in Grief, for the death of my poor fa∣ther.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="208"/>
I shall not enter into a detail of my Concerns and Troubles, for two reasons; because I am really afflicted and need no Airs of grief, and because they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my self. But I think you (without too great a com∣pliment) enough my friend, to be pleas'd to know he died easily, without a groan, or the sickness of two minutes; in a word, as silently and peacefully as he lived.<Q><L>Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori!</L></Q></P>
<P>I am not in the humour to say gay things, nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I can't pretend to entertain either Mr. <HI>Pulte∣ney</HI> or you, as you have done both my Lord <HI>Burlington</HI> and me, by your letter to Mr. <HI>Lowndes.</HI> I am only sorry you have no greater quarrel to Mr. <HI>Lowndes,</HI> and wish you paid some hundreds a year to the Land∣tax. That Gentleman is lately become an inoffensive person to me too; so that we may join heartily in our addresses to him, and (like true Patriots) rejoice in all that Good done to the Nation and Govern∣ment, to which we contribute nothing our selves.</P>
<P>I should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from <HI>Aix;</HI> you told me then that writing was not good with the Waters,
<PB N="132" REF="209"/>
and I find since you are of my opinion, that 'tis as bad without the Waters. But I fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that is so bad with the Waters; and then you might write without any manner of pre∣judice, if you writ like our Brother-poets of these days.</P>
<P>I have no story to tell that is worth your hearing; you know I am no man of Intrigue; but the Duchess of <HI>Hamilton</HI> has one which she says is worth my hearing, that relates to Mr. <HI>Pulteney</HI> and your self; and which she promises, if you won't tell me, she will. Her Grace has won in a Raffle a very fine Tweezercase; at the sight of which, my Tweezercase, and all other Tweezercases on the globe, <HI>Hide their di∣minish'd Heads.</HI></P>
<P>That Dutchess, Lord <HI>Warwick,</HI> Lord <HI>Stan∣hope,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Bellenden,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Lepell,</HI> and I can't tell who else, had your letters: Dr. <HI>Ar∣buthnot</HI> and I expect to be treated like Friends. I would send my services to Mr. <HI>Pulteney,</HI> but that he is out of favour at Court; and make some compliment to Mrs. <HI>Pulteney,</HI> if she were not a Whig. My Lord <HI>Burlington</HI> tells me she has as much out∣shin'd all the <HI>French</HI> Ladies, as she did the <HI>English</HI> before: I am sorry for it, because it will be detrimental to our holy Religion, if heretical Women should eclypse those

Pray tell her she has forgot the first Commis∣sion I ever troubled her with, and therefore it shall be the last (the very thing I fear she desires.) Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot</HI> is a strange creature; he goes out of town, and leaves his Bastards at other folks doors.

To be serious, you, and Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI> (nay and the Doctor if he has not dined) will be sensible of my concern and surprize at the commitment of that Gentleman, whose welfare is as much my concern as any Friend's I have.

<P>I Faithfully assure you, in the midst of that melancholy with which I have been so long encompassed, in an hourly Ex∣pectation almost of my Mother's death; there was no circumstance that render'd it more insupportable to me, than that I could not leave her to see you. Your own pre∣sent Escape from so imminent danger, I pray God may prove less precarious than my poor Mother's can be; whose Life at her age can at best be but a short Reprieve, or a longer Dying. But I fear, even that is more than God will please to grant me; for, these two days past, her most dangerous Symptoms are returned upon her; and unless there be a sudden change, I must in a few days, if not in a few Hours, be de∣priv'd of her. In the afflicting Prospect be∣fore me, I know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the View now given me (Heaven grant it may encrease) of your recovery. In the sincerity of my heart, I am excessively concern'd, not to be able to pay you, dear <HI>Gay,</HI> any part of the debt I very gratefully remember I owe you, on a like sad occasion, when you was here com∣forting me in her last great Illness.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MAY with great Truth return your Speech, that I think of you daily; oftner indeed than is consistent with the character of a reasonable man; who is rather to make himself easy with the things and men that are about him, than
<PB N="151" REF="228"/>
uneasy with those which are not. And you, whose Absence is in a manner perpe∣tual to me, ought rather to be remembred as a good man gone, than breathed after as one living. You are taken from us here, to be laid up in a more blessed state with Spirits of a higher kind: such I reckon his Grace and her Grace, since their Ba∣nishment from an earthly Court to an hea∣venly one, in each other and their friends; for I conclude none but true Friends will consort or associate with them afterwards. I can't but look upon myself (so unwor∣thy as a man of <HI>Twitnam</HI> seems, to be rank'd with such rectify'd and sublimated Beings as you) as a separated Spirit too from Courts and Courtly Fopperies. But I own, not altogether so divested of terrene Matter, nor altogether so spiritualized, as to be worthy admission to your Depths of Retirement and Contentment. I am tugg'd back to the world and its regards too often; and no wonder, when my re∣treat is but ten miles from the Capital. I am within Ear-shot of Reports, within the Vortex of Lyes and Censures. I hear sometimes of the Lampooners of Beau∣ty, the Calumniators of Virtue, the Jokers at Reason and Religion. I presume these are creatures and things as unknown to you, as we of this dirty Orb are to the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="152" REF="229"/>
of the Planet <HI>Jupiter:</HI> Except a few fervent prayers reach you on the wings of the post, from two or three of your zea∣lous Votaries at this distance; as one Mrs. <HI>Howard,</HI> who lifts up her heart now and then to you, from the midst of the <HI>Collu∣vies</HI> and Sink of Human Greatness at <HI>W<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>r:</HI> One Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> that fancies you may remem∣ber her while you liv'd in your mortal and too transitory State at <HI>Petersham:</HI> One Lord <HI>B.</HI> who admir'd the Duchess before she grew quite a Goddess; and a few others.</P>
<P>To descend now to tell you what are our Wants, our Complaints, and our Mi∣series here; I must seriously say, the Loss of any one Good woman is too great to be born easily: and poor Mrs. <HI>Rollinson,</HI> tho' a private woman, was such. Her Husband is gone into <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> very melancholy, and thence to the <HI>Bath,</HI> to <HI>live on,</HI> for such is our Fate, and Duty. Adieu.

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM something like the Sun at this Sea∣son, withdrawing from the World, but meaning it mighty well, and resolving to shine whenever I can again. But I fear the Clouds of a long Winter will over∣come me to such a degree, that any body will take a farthing candle for a better Guide, and more serviceable companion. My Friends may remember my brighter days, but will think (like the <HI>Irishman)</HI> that the <HI>Moon</HI> is a better thing when once I am gone. I don't say this with any allusion to my Poetical capacity as a Son of <HI>Apollo,</HI> but in my Companionable one, (if you'll suffer me to use a phrase of the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s) For I shall see or be seen of few of you, this Winter. I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea∣sure. I not only, as <HI>Dryden</HI> fairly says, <HI>Feel my notes decay</HI> as a Poet, but feel my Spirits flag as a Companion, and shall re∣turn again to where I first began, my Books. I have been putting my Library in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my Mind and Body (if I can) to some Life. A Friend,
<PB N="154" REF="231"/>
(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years, advised me to pass more time in my studies: I reflected, she must have found some Reason for this admoni∣tion, and concluded she wou'd compleat all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the Employment I am fittest for; Con∣versation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your life with my stupid state. For as to my living at <HI>Windsor</HI> with Ladies, &amp;c. it is all a dream; I was there but two nights, and all the day out of that company. I shall certainly make as little Court to others, as they do to me; and that will be none at all. My Fair-Weather-Friends of the Sum∣mer are going away for <HI>London,</HI> and I shall see Them and the Butterflies together, if I live till next year; which I would not desire to do, if it were only for their sakes. But we that are Writers, ought to love Po∣sterity, that Posterity may love us; and I would willingly live to see the Children of the present Race, meerly in hope they may be a little wiser than their Parents.</P>

<P>I Am astonished at the Complaints occa∣sion'd by a late <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Burlington;</HI> and I should be afflicted were there the least just Ground for 'em. Had the Writer attack'd <HI>Vice,</HI> at a Time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant, and so far from being conceal'd as a <HI>De∣fect,</HI> that it is proclaimed with Ostenta∣tion as a <HI>Merit;</HI> I should have been ap∣prehensive of the Consequence: Had he satirized Gamesters of a hundred thou∣and pounds Fortune, acquired by such Me∣thods as are in daily practice, and almost universally encouraged: Had he overwarm∣ly defended the <HI>Religion of his Country,</HI> a∣gainst such Books as come from every Press, are publickly vended in every Shop, and greedily bought by almost every Rank of Men; or had he called our excellent <HI>Weekly Writers</HI> by the same Names which they o∣penly bestow on the greatest Men <HI>in</HI> the Mi∣nistry, and <HI>out</HI> of the Ministry, for which they are all unpunished, and most rewarded:
<PB N="156" REF="233"/>
In any of these Cases, indeed, I might have judged him too presumptuous, and perhaps have trembled for his Rashness.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this small and modest Epistle, which attacks <HI>no one Vice</HI> whatsoever; which deals only in <HI>Folly,</HI> and not Folly in general, but a single Spe∣cies of it; that only Branch, for the oppo∣site Excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written must necessarily be cele∣brated. I fancied it might escape Censure, especially seeing how tenderly these Follies are treated, and really less accused, than Apologized for.<Q><L>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</L>
<L>Health to himself, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q> Is this such a <HI>Crime,</HI> that to impute it to a Man must be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an <HI>Innocent Folly,</HI> and much more <HI>Beneficent</HI> than the Want of it; for <HI>Ill Taste</HI> employs more hands, and diffuses Expence more than a <HI>Good</HI> one. Is it a <HI>Moral</HI> Defect? No, it is but a <HI>Natural</HI> one; a <HI>Want of Taste.</HI> It is what the best good Man living may be liable to: The worthiest Peer may live ex∣emplarily in an ill-favour'd House, and the best reputed Citizen be pleased with a vile Garden. I thought (I say) the Author had
<PB N="157" REF="234"/>
the common Liberty to observe a Defect, and to compliment a Friend for a Quality that distinguishes him: which I know not how any Quality should do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But they say the Satire is <HI>Personal.</HI> I thought it could not be so, because all its Reflexions are on <HI>Things.</HI> His Reflexions are not on the <HI>Man,</HI> but his House, Garden, &amp;c. Nay, he respects (as one may say) the <HI>Persons</HI> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the Nile, and the Triton: He is only sorry to see them (as he might be to see any of his <HI>Friends)</HI> ridiculous, by being in the wrong Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy, that to say a Thing is <HI>Personal,</HI> is the same as to say it is <HI>Injust,</HI> not considering, that no∣thing can be <HI>Just</HI> that is not <HI>Personal.</HI> I am afraid that <Q REND="inline">"all such Writings and Discourses as <HI>touch no Man,</HI> will <HI>mend no Man.</HI>"</Q> The Good Natured, indeed, are apt to be alarm∣ed at any thing like Satire; and the <HI>Guilty</HI> readily concur with the <HI>Weak</HI> for a plain Reason, because the Vicious look upon Fol∣ly as their <HI>Frontier:</HI>
<Q><L>—J am proximus ar det</L>
<L>Ucalegon—</L></Q>
No wonder those who know Ridicule be∣longs to them, find an inward Consolation
<PB N="158" REF="235"/>
in removing it from themselves as far as they can; and it is never so far, as when they can get it fixed on the <HI>best Characters.</HI> No wonder those who are Food for Satirists should rail at them as Creatures of Prey; every Beast born for our Use would be ready to call a Man so.</P>
<P>I know no Remedy, unless people in our Age would as little frequent the Theatres, as they begin to do the Churches; unless Co∣medy were forsaken, Satire silent, and every man left to do what seems good in his own Eyes, as if there were no King, no Priest, no Poet, in <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>But I find myself obliged to touch a Point, on which I must be more serious; it well deserves I should: I mean the malicious Ap∣plication of the Character of <HI>Timon,</HI> which I will boldly say, they would impute to the Person the most different in the World from a <HI>Man-hater,</HI> and the Person whose <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Wit</HI> have often been shewn in the <HI>rightest Place.</HI> The Author of that Epistle must certainly think so, if he has the same Opinion of his own Merit as Authors generally have; for he has been favoured by this very Person.</P>
<P>Why, in God's Name, must a <HI>Portrait,</HI> apparently collected from twenty different Men, be apply'd to one only? Has it his <HI>Eye?</HI> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <HI>Nose</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="236"/>
or <HI>Mouth?</HI> No, they are totally differing. What then, I beseech you? Why, it has the <HI>Mole on his Chin.</HI> Very well; but must the Picture therefore be his, and has no other man that Blemish?</P>
<P>Could there be a more melancholy In∣stance how much the Taste of the Publick is vitiated, and turns the most salutary and sea∣sonable Physick into Poison, than if amidst the Blaze of a thousand bright Qualities in a Great Man, they should only remark there is a <HI>Shadow</HI> about him, as what Eminence is without? I am confident the Author was incapable of imputing any such to One, whose whole Life (to use his own Expression in Print of him) is <HI>a continued Series</HI> of good and generous Actions.</P>
<P>I know no man who would be more con∣cerned, if he gave the least Pain or Offence to any innocent person; and none who would be less concerned, if the Satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare engage he will own it, with all the Freedom of one whose <HI>Censures</HI> are <HI>just,</HI> and who sets his <HI>Name</HI> to them.</P>

<SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Clamour rais'd about my Epistle to you, could not give me so much pain, as I receiv'd pleasure in seeing the general Zeal of the world in the cause of a great Man who is Beneficent, and the particular Warmth of your Lordship in that of a private Man who is innocent.</P>
<P>It was not the <HI>Poem</HI> that deserv'd this from you; for as I had the Honour to be your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like a Poet: but sure the <HI>Writer</HI> deserv'd more Candor, even from those who knew him not, than to promote a Report, which in re∣gard to that Noble Person was <HI>Impertinent;</HI> in regard to me, <HI>Villainous.</HI> Yet I had no great cause to wonder, that a Character be∣longing to <HI>twenty</HI> shou'd be applied to <HI>one;</HI> since, by that means, <HI>nineteen</HI> wou'd escape the Ridicule.</P>
<P>I was too well content with my Know∣ledge of that Noble Person's Opinion in this Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But
<PB N="161" REF="238"/>
since Malice and Mistake are so long a dy∣ing, I have taken the opportunity of a third Edition to declare <HI>His Belief,</HI> not only of <HI>My Innocence,</HI> but of <HI>Their Malignity,</HI> of the for∣mer of which my own Heart is as consci∣ous, as I fear some of theirs must be of the latter. His Humanity feels a Concern for the Injury done to <HI>Me,</HI> while His Greatness of Mind can bear with Indifference the In∣sult offer'd to <HI>Himself.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alludes to the Letter the Duke of <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/></HI> wrote to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> on this occasion, a Copy of which, together with Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s to his Grace, we hope to procure for the next Vo∣lume.</NOTE></P>
<P>However, my Lord, I own, that Critics of <HI>this Sort</HI> can intimidate me, nay half incline me to write no more: That wou'd be making the Town a Compliment which I think it deserves; and which some, I am sure, wou'd take very kindly. This way of Satire is dan∣gerous, as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of the lowest Rank can find any countenance from those of a Higher. Even from the Conduct shewn on this occasion, I have learnt there are some who wou'd rather be <HI>wicked</HI> than <HI>ridiculous;</HI> and therefore it may be safer to attack <HI>Vices</HI> than <HI>Follies.</HI> I will there∣fore leave my Betters in the quiet Possession of their <HI>Idols,</HI> their <HI>Groves,</HI> and their <HI>High-Places;</HI> and change my Subject from their

<HI>Pride</HI> to their <HI>Meanness,</HI> from their <HI>Vanities</HI> to their <HI>Miseries:</HI> And as the only certain way to avoid Misconstructions, to lessen Of∣fence, and not to multiply illnatur'd Appli∣cations, I may probably, in my next, make use of <HI>Real</HI> Names and not of Fictitious Ones.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This he did in his next Piece, which was the Epistle to the Lord <HI>Bathurst</HI> of the use of Riches.</NOTE></P>

<P>I Little doubt of your kind Concern for me, nor of that of the Lady you men∣tion. I have nothing to repay my Friends with at present, but prayers and good wishes. I have the satisfaction to find that I am as officiously serv'd by my Friends, as he that has thousands to leave in Legacies; besides the Assurance of their Sincerity.

God Almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be: I have found some relief, at least sometimes, from the Air of this Place. My Nights are bad, but many poor Creatures have worse.</P>
<P>As for you, my good Friend, I think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little Suspicions or Jealousies that often affect the sincerest Friendships; I am sure not on my side. I must be so sincere as to own, that tho' I could not help valuing you for those Talents which the World prizes, yet they were not the Foun∣dation of my Friendship: They were quite of another sort; nor shall I at present offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Last Request, that you continue that no∣ble <HI>Disdain</HI> and <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of Vice, which you seem naturally endu'd with, but still with a due regard to your own Safety; and stu∣dy more to reform than chastise, tho' the one often cannot be effected without the other.</P>

at my house it will be transmitted safe to me.</P>
