<HEAD TYPE="sub">Some of Emily's unfashionable Accomplish∣ments.
A female Polemic of the last
Century.</HEAD>
<P>IN the house of Miss Million, the cha∣racter
of Emily had opportunities of
unfolding itself not hitherto presented.
Rarely had she quitted the side of a blind
parent to enter into a contracted circle;
and if this circumstance had been detri∣mental
to her sagacity in human nature,
it proved not unfavourable to the high
culture of her elegant accomplishments.
In the enthusiasm of solitude fine talents
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
are pursued with an intensity not expe∣rienced
by those whose active circle, di∣versified
by the festivities of dissipation,
or the bustle of business, can only enable
them to become lovers of art, and not
artists. Solitude, which so frequently
excites the querulousness of genius, is a
severe mother who forms a lovely pro∣geny;
what in the great world had only
been a momentary amusement, there be∣comes
a permanent occupation. Sweet
is the uninterrupted industry of genius,
magical it's contracted day, and delicious
that inebriation of taste which becomes
an absorbing passion. In solitude alone
can now be acquired that difficult faci∣lity,
which, though it performs its mira∣cles
of art instantaneously, has been the
slow and painful acquisition of great prac∣tice
and greater meditation. Emily rose
with the fun; her prayer was a silent ori∣son
of aweful pleasure; her crayon was in
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
her hand during her morning walks, and if
she brought home some romantic figure,
some tenderer tint, from the aspect of
nature, it was a new enjoyment. The
clock told the hour of midnight, when,
with regret, she relinquished her volume,
and dissolved the enchantment of her
fancy. Often, as she sat by her father,
her busy spirits were so diffused in her
little employments, that Balsour could
only hear her gentlest suspirations; and
would say afterwards, I could almost <HI>see</HI>
you Emily very busy.</P>
<P>Emily, when she now compared her
talents with those of the favourites of fa∣shion,
including some professional artists,
felt a new confidence in her powers: but
she was silent, as well as modest; for she
found that she was inferior to all, if that
inferiority is to be allowed because she
was inexpert in the dull and formal rou∣tine
of life. A person of true genius is
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
soon placed beneath the level of equality
among the frivolous, because talents give
no real superiority among such associates;
they are applauded rapidly from an old
custom; but having been applauded with∣out
feeling, are as rapidly forgotten. The
permanent interests of such a society, con∣sist
in every thing that is the reverse of
genius; so that a certain mark of medi∣ocrity
of talent, is the pleasure which
such a circle affords. To Emily their
conversation was a language, of which the
rudiments were unknown; their amuse∣ments
passed away, too numerous and
too rapid to leave any delight; and their
most important concerns seemed the bur∣lesque
of human life, while what occa∣sioned
the most voluble lamentations, ex∣cited
her interior smile. Her beauty was
likely to occasion some trouble from the
men; but her extreme docility, and unpre∣suming
manners, rendered her at first sup∣portable
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
to the women. She conciliated
their favour by her willingness to be con∣sidered
as an inoffensive cypher, which of
itself was of no value, unless placed by
those who made a figure in the present
circle.</P>
<P>It is but performing an act of justice
to Miss Million to declare, that she was
infinitely delighted by the varied powers
of her new companion; she told all the
world so; and evinced as much pleasure
in exhibiting the performances of Emily,
as if they had been her own. Emily could
not but feel a warm gratitude for such
incessant partiality; but it often cost her
the pang of a deep blush, and the disgust
of an amplification, of which herself was
at once the divinity worshipped and the
victim immolated. There was such a
roughness in the gentleness of Miss Mil∣lion;
of her incense she was prodigal;
but in her zeal, she ever threw censer
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
and incense together in the face of her di∣vinity.
In vain Emily entreated the favour
of being placed in the shade, Miss Million
felt too much not to exhale her admira∣tion
in panegyrics. This amiable lady,
it must be acknowledged, lost nothing by
this excess of kindness; the higher the
praise she bestowed on Emily, the stronger
it's dazzling reflection fell on her own
cherished person. Was it not evident,
that the more she talked of "the old
blind lieutenant's daughter," her be∣nevolence
was amply displayed? The
more she was enraptured by the brilliant
finger of Emily on her harp, it was clear
the nerves of her intendered soul caught
the melodious vibrations; and no one
could say, when she overflowed in rap∣tures
concerning light and shade, as she
pointed to her paintings, but that Miss
Million must have a very sensible taste
for the magic of her canvas. Emily,
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
however, received the approbation and
esteem of Lady Belfield, whose favour
she felt an ambition to enjoy; for Lady
Belfield was herself a woman of talents,
and might have been a woman of genius,
and therefore knew the real value of her
varied and felicitous accomplishments.</P>
<P>Miss Million's circle was by no means
confined; she was proud of the acquaint∣ance
of every person of fashion; and be∣sides
her passion for masquerades and bo∣tany,
she was a distinguished patroness of
literary merit; her name was enrolled
among the earliest subscriptions; she had
received the honour of a dedication of a
novel, which was decorated not only by
her name, but by the splendour of her
engraved arms; and besides these literary
distinctions, it was rumoured, that she
herself had written one sonnet, yet pre∣served
in the virgin modesty of a manu∣script.
She was indeed declared to be
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
a prodigy of genius by several of her
friends, but particularly by three or four
great critics (one of whom it was univer∣sally
whispered wrote in one Review, if
not in all of them) and who did her the
honour of dining with her regularly three
days in the week.</P>
<P>An important person in the house of
Million, was Mrs. Bully the house∣keeper.
She was a colossus of vulgarity,
a daemon of religion, and a dragon of
virtue. On one occasion "her stars" had
doomed her to make a slight slip; but
religion had now so completely varnished
over this ancient piece of English china,
that it was a secret flaw, rather than a vi∣sible
crack. Nature had been kind to
her fellow-creatures, in exhibiting her
character in her appearance, but its glar∣ing
grossness was frequently subdued by
her ingenuity. Philosophy exults in
teaching men to conceal or ameliorate
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
their defects, and shrewd vulgarity is not
inferior to philosophy. The tones of a
voice, gross as the furred porch from which
they issued, she could render not displeasing
to some by adulation; arms, that might
have wielded the spear of Goliah, were
rendered not repulsive by officiousness;
and the heavy circumference of her body,
could on occasion roll with celerity to
the service of her patrons. She was in∣deed
a mansion-house of mortality; and
to look on her was to admire the solidity
of those materials, which Nature can form
when she simply works with mere flesh
and blood. Nature, indeed, had com∣mitted
no error in the formation of Mrs.
Bully; every <HI>part</HI> was uniformly gross;
but Nature's blunder consisted in the
<HI>whole.</HI> A being so nervous and athletic,
should never have been a woman.</P>
<P>Nor was her mind of an inferior size to
her body. Since her slippery adventure,
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
above hinted, she had held a most pious
abstinence from human flesh; her consti∣tutional
ideas, however, occasionally flamed
in her expressions, but were smothered in
her actions; of the latter she was fastidi∣ously
nice, so as to be enabled to discover,
in those of other people, a hundred little
peccancies against chastity, which escaped
their consciousness; for it is observable,
that persons who are themselves not of
the cleanest part of the human species,
are wonderfully alert in discerning the
slightest atoms of dirt on a very clean
person. Her mind was as active as it was
robust; and her strong passions, not hav∣ing
any more an opportunity of venting
themselves in the mollifications of love,
made most terrible explosions in obsolete
theology and politics. She read few
books published within this century. The
period of her researches was those days of
fanatical controversy, which so long dis∣graced
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
unenlightened England, when,
neither stationary in her religion or her
politics, every feverish reformer promul∣gated
a system of his own. The national
genius, therefore, had no system at all,
and branched out into reciprocal perse∣cutions.
What then was occasioned by
the energy of religion and politics, may,
perhaps, be renewed in this age, on an
inverse ratio, because we have no religion
and no politics.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bully had, therefore, high-church
arbitrary notions, and jacobite <HI>jure divino</HI>
principles. Some of her favourite au∣thors
were Prynne, and Sir Roger L'Es∣trange.
Filmer, on the divine right of
kings, gave her political creed; she stu∣died
the orthodoxy of that holy buffoon,
South; and was recreated by the merry
jests of Timothy and Philalethes. The
wickedness of the age she derived from
Socinianism; it's spirit of sedition from
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
the usurpation of the Calvinistic William;
and every loss of the English, and their
allies, she attributed to a judgment of
heaven, for that cool and tolerant spirit
of religion, which, much to her sorrow,
she now saw prevailing in the kitchen
as well as in the drawing-room.</P>
<P>When Emily made her appearance in
this family, she gave rise to numerous
speculations among the domestics. As
they could not possibly conceive how
Miss Million could want a companion,
who lived in one continued series of
company, some supposed, that the life of
Emily was as precious to Mr. Million
as that of his over-gorged Bob. Mrs.
Betty, the confidential maid of Miss Mil∣lion,
being the mere looking-glass of her
mistress, reflected her panegyrics. But
Mrs. Bully, their president in high coun∣cil,
observing that Emily went rarely to
church, posed Mrs. Betty, and alarmed
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
some in the council, by enquiring which
was her religion? This question, per∣haps,
is one of the most difficult enquiries
that can be made in the present day.
Mrs. Bully had formed dreadful suspi∣cions
of Emily's orthodoxy, because of
her irregular church attendance; and yet
to dislike a church, does not indicate any
irreverence for religion; for since the
church is personated by the parson, we
conceive it is no impiety to forsake any
house of God, when we find that the
fashionable clerical seems more inclined
to pay his respects to his parishioners
than his reverence to his God.</P>
<P>She one day bounced into her apart∣ment,
and seating herself, began her in∣quisitorial
examination. She opened by
an high eulogium of reading, which she
compared to cookery. "I love (said she)
the old firloin, and plain round of beef,
where 'tis cut and come again; none of
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
your flimflams and French dishes. Your
modern books are like enough proper for
their authors' wits, being very small and
thin. I like your books big as Bibles; ay,
and the Bible is the best book. Novels are
the reading of your fine ladies; but if we
like love-stories, there's a mort of um in
the Bible."</P>
<P>"I think, Mrs. Bully, (replied Emily)
most of them had better have been
omitted."</P>
<P>"The Lord preserve your soul! not
a tittle must be done away. Every word
there is God's word. Read St. Austin's
City of God; and the church has de∣cided.
Let me tell you, Miss, that the
church of England is without spot or
wrinkle; mark that! and cursed are all
dissenters."</P>
<P>"I am no dissenter, Mrs. Bully; but
these are matters for different heads than
mine."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>
"What is your eternal salvation to be
obtained by others, as the cursed papists
say? Mayharp, Miss, you don't believe
in the Athanasian creed?"</P>
<P>"I do not understand it."</P>
<P>"That's an old vile excuse for not
believing. Now a syllable can be done
away. Does'n't it tell you, that you
must be damned if you don't believe in
it? Take my word for it, that Saint
Athanasius knew more about his own
creed than that fiend Arius. And what
think you of Constantine the Great?"—</P>
<P>"Some say he was a felon."</P>
<P>"I tell you, Miss, he was a saint,
Don't you know, Miss, the distinctions
and the differences between Trinunities,
Coessentialities, Modalities, eternal Ge∣nerations,
eternal Processions, Incarna∣tions,
and Hypostatical Unions?"—</P>
<P>"What is all this, Mrs. Bully? Are
such terms, points of faith? They seem
fitter for a Conjurer than a Christian."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="19"/>
"Oh! that I had lived in those bliss∣ful
days of controversy, where the con∣cerns
of a whole city consisted in disputes
about the Consubstantiality; when, in
quitting the shop of a trader, one not
only got by one's divinity a great bar∣gain,
but also the man to change his re∣ligion;
when the dear boys in the street
would fight one another for Arius and
Athanasius! To be sure Arius had the
best of it while he lived; and Constantine
wrote to them, that they were both fools
for disputing about what no one could
understand: but didn't Arius die, like the
Empress of Russia? Foul heretics should
die in foul places; dark holes for poi∣soned
rats. And pray, Miss, what do
you think of Tim and Phil?"</P>
<P>"I am not acquainted with the names
of all the servants in the house."</P>
<P>"Servants! I am so used to them,
that I always call them by these familiar
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
names. I mean the dialogues of Timothy
and Philalethes. There your Tom Paines,
and all such Sadducees, are answered.
Have you got, Miss, all Sir Roger's
works, and a good number of the pam∣phlets
of Cromwell's times? I collect and
read all;—small type, large paper, and
thick volume. I love tugging at a book,
not skimming like a mealy butterfly."</P>
<P>"Really, Mrs. Bully, all your authors
are not even known to me by name.
I have only two books, I think printed
by one of Cromwell's party, and those
are the Paradises of Milton."</P>
<P>"Abominable! I marvel, Miss, how
you can bear a page of such "a blind
guide," as Sir Roger wittily called him.
His eyes shewed a judgment of heaven.
No wonder he drew the devil so well,
for he was only describing his protector
Oliver. He'll protect him finely in the
eternity of hell torments; secretary now
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
to Lucifer! And pray, Miss, how do
you like South for his joking sermons;
and the elegant Stanhope on the epistles,
who observes, that an unbeliever, if he
were in heaven, would find no more
pleasure there, than a pig in a drawing-room;
and Scott, and Archbishop Laud,
and Bishop Blackhall, whose works are in
three folios, heavier than I can hold in
my hands, and which I bought the other
day for three-pence each? A curse on
this Arian age! All weighty books now
are selling by weight!"</P>
<P>"My favourite sermons are those of
Blair."</P>
<P>"Abominable! why they contain no∣thing
but morality! not a word on the
contested points of faith, the incarnation,
the consubstantiality, grace, and justifi∣cation;
little asthmatic periods, as if he
wanted sense to carry him through a dozen
words. You have a great deal to learn,
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
Miss, on the score of religion and politics.
You think I don't read novels; but I
like much those in folio. I am now read∣ing
the great Cassandra, and the no∣ble
Oroondates. That Oroondates was a
brave fellow; he killed above fifty he∣roes,
almost as brave as himself; and his
speeches are ten honest pages in length;
none of your squeaking heroes, who are
afraid to speak out like men; but I
know the reason, for their authors have
nothing for them to say."</P>
<P>"I could never read (said Emily) those
voluminous romances. Their heroes and
heroines are a distinct order of beings
from ourselves; and I have my suspicions,
whether they ever existed but in the
prurient fancies of their authors. Their
descriptions are never local, one place is
depicted like another; their style is in∣sufferably
languid; their incidents, with∣out
being romantic, violate the known
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
customs of every age; and their authors
seem to have merely despoiled Homer of
his true heroes, to transform them into
the disgusting petit-maitres of Paris. A
race that, when they existed, were only
ridiculed, and that now are quite obso∣lete.
Such are their protracted conclu∣sions,
that we cannot but quite forget
what we had read, should we ever arrive
at the close of the twelfth volume."</P>
<P>"Abominable! I forget nothing.
Since, Miss, you don't like bulky books,
mayhap you have never read the Bible
through?"</P>
<P>"Many parts I have never finished.
I would neither corrupt my imagination
with impurity, nor steel my heart by bar∣barous
narratives and sanguinary perse∣cutions."</P>
<P>"Then the Lord preserve you from
damnation! Samuel hewed Agag alive,
and he did well; he was an Arian of his
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
day. And the Philistines, the Canaanites,
the Hittites, and the Jebusites!—(she rose
from her chair gradually) noble work in
those days! Oh! that I could send this
arm, like another Samson, among your
Arian dogs, your Socinian wolves, and
your roaring lions of Priestleyites! I tell
you the church of England is without
spot or wrinkle; and James the III. not
William the III. was our king. Why
does the French rebellion prosper, but
because people don't go to church on
Sundays? No wonder that the wind
blew so boisterously last night, that three
trees have been blown down in the park,
and their majesties were obliged to rise
from bed.—We are all a-going! The
earth reels like a drunkard! as nobly
saith Isaiah. Manifold are our sins! as
Moore says in his last year's almanack.
We are an abomination before the Lord!
Oh! that I could eschew this Babylon!
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
I tell you, Miss, the church of England
is without spot or wrinkle."</P>
<P>So saying, she hurried out of the room,
and, flinging the door, hastened to com∣municate
her intelligence to the kitchen;
horror for Emily's Arianism, and contempt
for her taste for novels in folio, spread
from her through all the lower part of
the house.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Emily meets Charles and Vaurien. The
Dissentions of two great Critics, shewing
the Utility of Christian Names.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Belfield contracted with
Emily a more passionate degree of
friendship than a lady of her high rank,
in general, is capable of experiencing;
but her Ladyship is one of those not very
rare instances, we imagine, where we ob∣serve
an amiable and ingenious female
studiously annihilating her virtues and
her talents in the giddy, and often cri∣minal,
vortex of dissipation. Nature will
sometimes prevail over Fashion.</P>
<P>One morning, when these two la∣dies
were conversing with Miss Million,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
Charles and Vaurien were announced.
When they entered, their eyes were at
once directed on Emily; she recognised
Vaurien, and deeply blushed; her con∣fusion
was fortunately concealed, while
Miss Million introduced these gentle∣men.
Lady Belfield said, "Dear Miss
Emily, allow me to speak a word for
one of these men; for that great child is
as silent as a Turkish mute, (looking on
Charles); and half a word for the other,
who, I am sensible, wants no aid of mine
to engage the attentions of an accom∣plished
girl." Vaurien made a very ele∣gant
compliment, and Charles a very
silent bow. Neither of the two ladies
suspected that they had ever met before;
and they themselves did not chuse to
notice their former rencounter at Mrs.
Wilson's; for which, no doubt, each had
some peculiar reason, and which to dis∣cover
may serve, if the reader thinks
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
proper, to exercise his thinking powers,
as well as his eyes, although the latter
are generally considered as the only re∣quisites
for novel reading.</P>
<P>Vaurien was the soul of the conversa∣tion.
He flew from topic to topic, and
poured out to Miss Million all the little
news that he had collected in the course
of that morning's perambulation. He
hinted at a marriage, narrated a duel,
discovered an intrigue, and informed
them, that last night Lady Bab lost ten
thousand pounds at one sitting, and was
obliged to retire for the unexpected de∣livery
of a son and heir. He was a vo∣lume
of secret memoirs; and every trifle
was embellished by the graces of his
manner. To Emily he directed a richer
vein of conversation: he listened to the
copious catalogue of her talents, as given
by Miss Million; and when one of her
paintings was pointed out to his obser∣vation,
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
he gazed on it for some time,
commended it in a few energetic ex∣pressions,
and, at the same time, exhi∣bited
his accuracy of taste by some slight
corrections, and his picturesque fancy,
by describing how, from that subject,
another might be formed more romantic
to the imagination. Emily was more
gratified by this discriminating criticism
than the general applause of others, and
formed a high conception of that opu∣lence
of fancy, which seemed always to
enrich what it found. Lady Belfield in∣treated
her to touch her harp; she played
with her accustomed ease; and while she
was receiving the thanks of her fair
friends, Vaurien swept his hand carelesly
over the instrument, and called forth the
tenderest air. Solicited to proceed, he
said: "Ah, no! I venture not above
a prelude, after harmonies like those
which have now charmed. All my skill
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
is only an effusion of the heart, and all
my airs are only a few associations of the
memory, when I wandered in the viny
vales of Languedoc." Emily, it must be
confessed, was delighted by the singular
versatility of his powers. Lady Belfield
rallied Vaurien upon this discovery of his
harp music: "What a dangerous man
are you, Vaurien, when you can conceal
even little accomplishments, that they
may be reserved to surprise and delight
on the most impressive occasion. It is to
Miss Emily we owe your performance on
the harp. But you, Charles, neither say,
nor do any thing."</P>
<P>"Your Ladyship knows (replied
Charles) that some are born to embel∣lish
life by all that it has of the agree∣able,
while others must restrict themselves
to admire and love that merit they dare
not rival."</P>
<P>Emily liked Charles for this liberal
commendation of a person who was evi∣dently
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
his rival; that is a merit (she
thought) superior to the merit itself.</P>
<P>Vaurien had now come down to the
very last morning anecdote; and he knew
that there was a certain point in conver∣sation,
when an able and sagacious talker
takes his departure. It is that point, at
which what we have said leaves a lively
impression on our friends; a quarter of
an hour more would weary, or less would
not satisfy. It exacts no ordinary judg∣ment
to know when to quit a chair.
The exhausted Frenchman was now rising,
when the two great critics, Mr. Acrid
and Mr. Antique, were announced. With
indecent haste Antique rushed in, breath∣less.
"I have," cried he "got near a whole
page traced accurately on oiled paper.
I tell you, Mr. Acrid, 'tis an original.
We have had a secret committee; but
no one can read it except Ireland; he is
inspired; he reads it just as if it were his
own writing!"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="32"/>
"And have you a page of Shakspeare
never read before?" said Miss Million.</P>
<P>Antique. "I heard Dr. Parr say, that
he must express his <HI>conviction</HI> in periods
more <HI>dignified</HI> than Ireland could roll. I
saw Boswell fall on his knees, raise his
hands, and thank God!"</P>
<P>"Mere antiquaries are ever to be
duped," replied Mr. Acrid with a dic∣tatorial
tone. "Without taste to dis∣cern,
penetration to decide, or that illu∣minating
sagacity that combines it's un∣erring
calculations; with a brainless head
and sightless eyes, you pore on inscrip∣tions,
sepulchral monuments, and manu∣scripts
that would never have been such,
had they merited literary honours. You
only read the dullness of other times, and
call this erudition; the gross jests of our
gross forefathers, and you conceive you
are men of wit. You discover some
clumsy utensil, and you engrave it as a
model for modern elegance. The dullest
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
writer of a dull age, becomes to the mere
antiquary the most precious of his own
times; and yet such bear no other re∣semblance
to Midas than by his exterior
sign, their touch cannot turn lead into
gold. You have already stifled poor
Shakspeare by your commentaries, the
text cannot breathe freely amidst your
incumbrances. Here is a man who
writes with an orthography of his own
invention, and in a style that has no in∣vention
at all; and every fool of learning
is summoned to admire a modern skeleton
in an ancient leaden coffin. But did not
my friend George take the true dimen∣sions
of the intellects of the director of
your worshipful society? A curved cor∣ner
of an old chimney-piece, duly steeped
in what shall be nameless, till it became
variegated with the dark rainbow hues
of antiquity, and, tasted by his sagacious
finger, smelt of other times, was engraved
with some Saxon characters, and the name
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
of Hardycknute; at length, being pro∣perly
vinegared and verdigreased, it ex∣cited
his antiquarian curiosity; he doats
on it to madness, makes syllables of let∣ters
and words of syllables, and enriches
the archives of your society with a most
learned dissertation on the drinking-horn
of Hardy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>knute! Lay your Ireland's
Shakspeare on this curved corner of an
old chimney-piece."</P>
<P>The laugh went against Mr. Antique,
who sat down much cooler than he came
in, muttering vengeance. A circum∣stance
occurred to these two great cri∣tics,
which may serve as an exemplary
lesson to some greater ones, to under∣stand
each other when their disputes run
loud and swelling as a rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ing torrent,
or quick and fiery as kindled straw. Mr.
Antique was a virtuoso and a collector,
more famous for his library than his
learning; wealthy in medals, profound in
title-pages, an ogler of statues, and a
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
great admirer of the works of nature
when they appeared in the forms of but∣terflies,
pebbles, and conchae veneris; he
therefore was tolerably read in authors
who had written on <HI>curious</HI> subjects; but
Mr. Acrid held such authors in sovereign
contempt, and vociferated his raptures
for writers of taste. In point of under∣standing,
or intellectual power, he was
much on an equality with his brother
critic, whom he so much contemned.
Not but that his criticisms were ex∣tremely
just, which they could not fail
to be, as they were, with little variation,
the sentiments of the noblest critics; and
yet we are informed, that his entire li∣brary
consisted of only two biographical
dictionaries, so that he travelled on the
high roads of literature merely at the
public expence; and when it happened
that he was stopped at a turnpike-gate,
he only discovered his extreme poverty.
The following dialogue now ensued:—</P>
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
<P>Antique. "You will find a very mi∣nute
detail of that picture in Richard∣son."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Richardson detail a picture!
Not he. He was no petty virtuoso."</P>
<P>Antique. "Mr. Richardson no vir∣tuoso!
Give me leave to affirm, that he
is at the head of our virtuosos. He was
both a curious collector and a very mi∣nute
describer."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Richardson a puny col∣lector!
Sir, it is false, very false. That
he was a minute describer I agree."</P>
<P>Antique. "I repeat he was a curious
collector. I retort your charge. I know
he prolonged his tour, and remained
above a year at Rome. It took him
three months only to describe one of
Poussin's pictures."</P>
<P>Acrid. "He never was out of Eng∣land.
His imagination was a true Bri∣tish
sea-coal fire, and borrowed not a
spark from a foreign rival."</P>
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<P>Antique. "Not out of England! I
shall grow mad! 'Tis a calumny which
only an insidious enemy could propa∣gate.
His very minute descriptions tes∣tify
his ocular examination. His works
give us the very attitudes."</P>
<P>Acrid. "So, Sir, you think that a
man must travel out of England to catch
those correct resemblances which true
taste admires. Truly your taste is sin∣gular;
but his works are immortal."</P>
<P>Antique. "Immortal! Why no man of
any taste would give them house-room."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Not Richardson's works
house-room! (he lifted his hands higher
than his head)</P>
<P>"O! for shame, Mr. Antique," said
Miss Million. "No one can agree with
you there."</P>
<P>Antique. "Why they are all daubs;
mere garret furniture."</P>
<P>Acrid. "I lose my patience—I am
nearly suffocated with rage. Do you
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
mean, Mr. Antique, to insult me by
insulting Richardson?"</P>
<P>Antique. "Mr. Acrid, do you mean
to reflect on my connoisseurship, by sup∣posing
that I could approve of his wretched
works? Where are they now to be found?
All gone and forgotten!"</P>
<P>Here Mr. Acrid rose in great passion,
looked with a distortion of countenance
on Mr. Antique, a mixture of fierceness
and contempt; then smoothing his face
into a sardonic smile, that is, with a
gay countenance and an aching heart, he
turned to the ladies, and appealed to
them, if Richardson's works were not in
every body's hands, and in every col∣lection
of taste?</P>
<P>Antique. "In every body's hands, and
in every collection of taste! Was ever man
so provoked and insulted as I am?"</P>
<P>Acrid. "His fable is protracted, but
his lively and delicate strokes place every
object before the eye."</P>
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
<P>Antique. "What do you mean by
his fable? But I confess his minuteness
is admirable."</P>
<P>Acrid. "Every character is so pro∣minent,
it is as in the great original of
nature."</P>
<P>Antique. "Agreed, as to the great
original; but nature is quite a superflu∣ous
term.</P>
<P>Acrid. "The artless sentiments of
Pamela, the refined delicacy of Clarissa,
the elevation of Sir Charles Grandison."</P>
<P>Antique. "What connexion have
these novels with the works of Richard∣son?
I could never read them. No
facts, all imagination.</P>
<P>Acrid. "With this avowal, you yet
presume to appreciate the merits of Ri∣chardson;
you aspire to dictate as an ar∣biter
of taste!"</P>
<P>Miss Million. "Dear Mr. Antique,
is this possible? never read Richard∣son!"</P>
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
<P>Antique. "Have you all conspired
together to make me crazy? I shake
with indignation. Do you suppose that
I, who attend every picture sale in town,
can read such enormous novels? I have
enough to do to read through all the sale
catalogues of books and pictures; and I
have an entire collection, with their prices
marked, for these twenty years past; an
invaluable library of catalogues. If Jo∣nathan
Richardson the father, not Jona∣than
Richardson the silly son, the first of
whom I have been talking of, had seen
them, what volumes of criticism had come
out!"</P>
<P>Acrid. "<HI>Jonathan</HI> Richardson! why,
man, we have been talking of <HI>Samuel</HI>
Richardson! I know nothing of your
pair of <HI>Jonathans!</HI>"</P>
<P>Antique. "Then, positively, my dear
Acrid, we are all in a mistake! I mean
Richardson the painter, and you Richard∣son
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
the novelist! You know the first
has published some very curious disserta∣tions
on his art; a great critic in paint∣ing,
but the worst of painters! I praised
his fine descriptions of pictures, but could
never agree that his own works had any
merit. How the deuce has all this hap∣pened?
As for the <HI>other</HI> Richardson, I
know nothing about him; a collector
never values <HI>such writers.</HI></P>
<P>Acrid (with an air of triumph). "There,
ladies, Mr. Antique has confessed he has
never read the great Richardson, the
Shakspeare of novelists; and yet he will
assert and assure you, that he can decide
on Shakspeare in manuscript."</P>
<P>Antique. "That, my dear friend,
entirely consists in the foxiness of the ink,
and the dingy fine yellow brown of the pa∣per,
with the water-mark of the jug; all
worthy of the divine man! Let us not part
in anger. Critics should be more cautious
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
in their controversies, and christian names
are full as useful as surnames."</P>
<P>Through the intercession of Miss Mil∣lion,
peace was established between this
couple of critics; but a latent revenge
rankled in the breast of Antique, for
Acrid's contempt of him, and Ireland's
Shakspeare; and when Miss Million en∣quired
the literary news of the day, he took
an opportunity to distil his gall on Acrid's
discernment. We shall therefore resume
our dialogue.</P>
<P>Antique. "We have some important
intelligence in the republic of letters; you
have not then heard concerning Eliza?"</P>
<P>"All that we understand (said Miss
Million) is that the amatory effusions of
Eliza are only known for their delicacy,
their harmony, and their poetic beauty,
so often admired by Mr. Acrid. The
fair still is in the shade."</P>
<P>Acrid here made a very curtailed bow,
and quickly retired.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
<P>Antique. "Ay! Ay! let him go!
let him go! to insult me with my defec∣tive
taste for Shakspeare! Now, ladies,
judge what kind of discernment Mr. Acrid
is blest with. Eliza! Ha! ha! ha!"</P>
<P>"Eliza" exclaimed Miss Million "is
certainly a delightful poetess! she has
two great merits; she not only writes
finely, but copiously and incessantly.
Her last sweet pastoral of 500 lines, is
excellent; but I wish she had divided it
into five pastorals. But these lines are
fanciful beyond poetical fancy; they are
quite fashionable poetry: observe the bril∣liant
<HI>concetto</HI> of the close!<Q><L>The <HI>muslin'd</HI> MOON mid STARS of <HI>tissue</HI> hung,</L>
<L>The <HI>gauzy</HI> AIRS a <HI>silky</HI> softness FLUNG;</L>
<L>Bright rose the MASQUERADE of Fancy's <HI>dream</HI>;</L>
<L>A CONCERT, seemed the SOLO of the <HI>stream.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Antique. "You don't know the
news, I see. You will agree with me,
that they must be execrable. Why they are
Dick Distich's!"</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44"/>
Miss Million. "O shocking! what is
Eliza, Dick Distich?"</P>
<P>Antique. "Hear the anecdote! Dick
Distich, you know, wrote verses in all
measures; but, in quantity, they were
without measure. As he was so kind as
to reverse his name at the close of his
poems, it was of use to the incautious.
Ridiculed, but not so fortunate as to be
neglected, he retreated to the country in
a nervous fever. His name he knew would
damn his works; so calling himself Eliza,
and getting a female friend to transcribe
his poems, he sent them to the famous
paper. All the old Cruscans rose to a
man! Odes, elegies, and sonnets, were
poured on Eliza, enough to have made
a fine snow-shower at Drury Lane.
Eliza was rather broad and warm in her
diction. She was a Sappho, a tenth muse,
and a fourth grace. Our poets were ena∣moured
of this most sensitive Eliza.
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
Acrid was as clamorous in his raptures,
as fifty amorous cats on the pantiles.
He imagined her to be the old Laura;
so he addressed her with this tender billet:
"Amiable Eliza! I love you; can you
pardon the avowal? But I have made it;
and I know not to repeat of it. My
passion is like your genius; it terrifies or
soothes; hope and despair prey on my
soul. Hope! alas! I do not hope, and
yet I love." The answer of Eliza to this
amatory note, was the most consolatory,
and bid him hope for every favour; but
she added, "What if you knew me?
would your classical eye approve of my
person? Alas! I am short and brown;
but so was Sappho; my nose is snubbed;
but so was the beautiful Poppaea's; I
have a singular custom when I kiss to
bite; but such were the marks of fondness
which Flora left on her Pompey. If my
personal defects can thus be forgiven, as so
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
many classical imitations are in my verses;
then will Sappho receive you as her
Phaon; but, I fear, faithless and accom∣plished
as that boy." An appointment
was made. Dick invited several friends
to witness the lover's first interview. We
stood behind a screen; the great critic
arrived; when lo! to the credit of his
critical talents, his Eliza stood before
him, in the contemned person of poor
Dick Distich. What's the consequence?
The critic's reputation has received the
<HI>coup de grace,</HI> while Eliza's verses are now
all condemned in one mass. What was
sweet fancy in Eliza, is rank dulness in
Dick Distich. The poetical hermaphro∣dite
has gained nothing; and the sex are
but ill complimented; for when Dick was
supposed to be a woman, those verses
were applauded, which are now con∣demned
because he is a man. So, ladies,
I recommend the poor devil to your pro∣tection."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
"Lord! I wish I had known all this
before," cried Miss Million. "Here is a
confusion in the realms of taste! We have
been applauding the narcotic infusions of
Dick Distich, while we thought them
the dissolving effusions of a Sappho. How
can one judge of people's poetry, if they
deceive us with names?"</P>
<P>"In these cases" observed Charles, "we
can never fail, if we read poems without
regarding names. Should the reader
then blunder, he must not blame the
author. You may now exclaim with
Juliet, <Q>What's in a name?—</Q> and then, <Q>O Distich, Distich, wherefore art thou Distich?</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XIX.</HEAD>

Voluptuary.</HEAD>
<P>VAURIEN had become the <HI>friend</HI>
of Lady Belfield; and this word,
even in the dictionary of fashionable lan∣guage,
has not degenerated into a non-entity;
but the adroitness of vice, knows
to disguise it's impurities, by adorning
them with the holy titles that are sacred
to virtue; it is thus that it's grossness is con∣cealed,
it's deformity invites, and it's horrors
are crowned with delights that are not it's
own. We think, at first, that we enjoy
love, when we grasp at lust; that we are
soothed by friendship, when we listen to sy∣cophancy;
and that we pursue amusement
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
when we are heavily dragged through dis∣sipation.
To the clear eye of reason, the
pleasures of vice pay an involuntary tri∣bute
of honour to virtue, by assuming it's
name; and it is at least a consolation to
some, and a conviction to many, that
vice would lose half of its seduction, did
it not at first appear in the disguise of
some virtue.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield, enamoured of the gay
and accomplished. Frenchman, was for
some time occupied in his enjoyment;
but it was no soothing alliance of the
heart; no imperishable union of two
kindred virtues; it was merely an inflam∣mation
of the senses; a flame that raged
at intervals, and often sunk in the dying
embers of passion, and left behind them
the disgusts of criminal pleasure, the cold
ashes of satiety. The modest and re∣served
Charles, still agitated her soul with
those delicate impressions, by which the
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
blushing form of unpolluted man touches
and irritates even the bosom of cor∣ruption.
His modesty but inflamed de∣sire,
and his apathy was a mystery
she could not penetrate. In vain she
planned occasions to surprize him into
seduction; his principles were firm; and
could they ever have yielded, another
passion at this time came to his aid, and
his heart was filled with the image of
Emily.</P>
<P>Charles had frequently entered into con∣versations
with this amiable girl, and she
had discovered in him a secret value which
was more delightful to her feelings when
absent, than the recollection of Vaurien's
more applauded and dazzling qualities.
Vaurien fascinated in her presence; Charles
enchanted in his absence; one was to be
looked at, and the other was remembered.
The one was all that imagination could
form of the agreeable, and the other all
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
that sentiment could form of the tender.
The voice of Vaurien was music that re∣galed
the ear, but the voice of Charles
penetrated the abstract ear of memory.
Vaurien exhibited the most agile graces
of form, the most delightful amenity of
manners; and, never uniform, varied a
thousand shapes, and charmed in all.
Charles had nothing of this versatility;
he mused, and was rarely gay; but there
was a sweetness in his seriousness, and a
dignity in his comportment, which, by
it's very uniformity, impressed a heart sus∣ceptible
of reflection and sentiment, with
features more prominent and energetic,
than the softer lineaments of Vaurien.
Vaurien never gained on reflection, all
was seen at once; nothing was concealed
for the private eye; he seduced the pub∣lic
applause, but could not fix the
individual affection. Charles exhibited
a latent merit. His commonest action
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
proceeded from a superior impulse. In
the silence of meditation, in that secret
hour when absent from our friends, we
try, without passion, their merits, their
follies, and their weaknesses, Vaurien
appeared a common man, who seemed to
perform uncommon actions; and Charles
an uncommon man, whose actions were
set off neither by ostentation nor singula∣rity.
Vaurien possessed the mind of Emily,
but Charles was the inmate of her heart.</P>
<P>Emily and Charles, amidst their bril∣liant
circles, seemed only to taste of a
fugitive happiness, when they could con∣trive
to sit together, and indulge their
sympathy of sentiment. In the eyes of
Emily might be read her soul; she look∣ed
her thoughts; she had none to dis∣guise;
but some perplexities, some
blushes, some tremors, she experienced in
these short interviews with Charles. He
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
read to her, one day, the close of the
Spring of Thomson, where, with peculiar
sensibility, that poet of lovers raises a lit∣tle
fairy existence of conjugal felicity; a
fading dream, that claims a tear from the
eye it has solaced; a heaven of love, that
charms and pains it's trembling, it's suf∣fering,
it's doubtful martyr. As he pro∣ceeded,
his eyes wandered from the book
to Emily; he pronounced words while
attention wandered; he stopped sud∣denly;
Emily leant on his shoulder, to
look at the verse; she saw a tear glis∣ten
on the page. "You have missed whole
lines, Sir," said she. "I will recom∣mence
the passage, Miss Emily; I was
thinking that the tender Thomson loved
and was beloved, yet knew not the only
felicity of Love. I proceed—
<Q><L>What is the world to them!</L>
<L>Who in each other clasp, whatever fair</L>

<L><PB N="51" REF="54"/>High fancy forms and lavish hearts can wish,</L>
<L>Something than beauty dearer, should they look</L>
<L>Or on the mind, or mind-illumin'd face—</L></Q>
Charles raised his eye from the volume;
the face of Emily was covered with
blushes; she gazed on him, and seemed
to withdraw her eye with timidity, re∣luctance,
and alarm. When he came to
these lines,
<Q><L>An elegant sufficiency, content,</L>
<L>Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books,</L>
<L>Ease and alternate labour, useful life,</L>
<L>Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven.</L></Q>
Charles uttered an audible sigh. Emily,
smiling, said, "Sure that sigh was not
for Thomson!"—"Ah! no, Miss Emily,
I wonder why I sigh; what lines can have
a less-adorned simplicity? and yet they
penetrate my heart. I fear that sigh was
nothing but vanity and selfishness; it
was for myself."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="55"/>
It is evident, that when Thomson is
read by two young persons of either sex,
with this taste and sensibility, the Sea∣sons
threaten to disturb the repose of
friendship by the intrusion of love; and
when love is conducted by poetry, his
armed hand is wrapt beneath a gay man∣tle,
and strikes more deeply a perfidious
blow.</P>
<P>Emily's quiet was attempted to be
disturbed by others. The Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion enlisted among her
admirers. He was a boyish divine, a
cassocked huntsman, and a clerical buck.
His visits to Miss Million were not so
uninterrupted as he desired, owing to his
father, an opulent Rector residing in
the vicinity of Salisbury, and also to the
Bishop of that diocese, who, as he ob∣served,
was "a blockhead of the old
school." Indeed, this Bishop was by no
means a man of fashion; he bore a most
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
religious antipathy towards all those young
clergymen who were in full possession of a
plurality of livings, and who escaped from
them all to reside in the metropolis, and
to dress their hair as they thought proper.
Ephraim was the hope of his family, be∣cause
he was the eldest son; he had there∣fore
been his father's favourite in his cra∣dle;
in which place the sacerdotal infant
may be said to have felt a simoniacal
propensity, for indeed simony was a <HI>con∣stitutional</HI>
vice in that family. There, by
some ingenuity of his pious father the
Rector, he was inducted into two good
advowsons, so that ere the young gentle∣man
issued from his pupillage, he <HI>pre∣sented
himself</HI> to his own livings, and pi∣ously
undertook the cure of the souls of
several parishes. He was a young man
of modest dispositions, and held in vene∣ration
the holy profession; and as he at
once was a Nimrod in the field, and a
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
Narcissus within doors, he decently pro∣cured
two persons to perform his own du∣ties.
For this purpose he found two fa∣thers
of large families, at the market-price
then of forty pounds a year. He
was also a rigid observer of the utmost so∣lemnity
in the performance of all church
services, and testified an uncommon zeal
for ecclesiastical rights; the former con∣sisted
in the personal appearance of his
curates; and whenever he heard the
slightest complaint of a nasal twang, or a
guttural digestion of words, or of a brown∣ish
black coat, such a curate was dis∣charged
at a week's notice; and his zeal
for ecclesiastical rights was evidently ex∣hibited
in his seizure of all bands, black
gloves, white favours, funeral scarfs, and
the christening or marriage guinea. On
the whole, he was a most orthodox sup∣porter
of the <HI>church</HI>; understanding by
this word a certain ancient building, en∣circled
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
by a burying-ground, and the in∣terior
furnished with a certain water-ba∣son,
vulgarly denominated the baptismal
fount; burials and christenings, therefore,
producing no inconsiderable income, he
most zealously supported the aforesaid
<HI>church.</HI></P>
<P>But although a sturdy advocate for
church subordination, he could not con∣sent
to grant this to his Bishop. Too
active in field sports during the summer,
and quite exhausted in town dissipa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions
during the winter, he most justly com∣plained
of the incessant and personal at∣tacks
of his said Bishop; who, particu∣larly
at one of his annual dinners given
to his assembled brethren, did most inde∣licately
reprimand our fashionable Rector;
Vicar, and Prebendary, for all these ho∣nours
and their appurtenances were united
in young Ephraim. He resolved now
to throw off the yoke of ecclesiastical ju∣risdiction;
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
and, to the great comfort of
our sacerdotal bucks, they may enjoy the
revenues of an ecclesiastic, without the
<HI>borish</HI> performance of the functions.
Ephraim had great interest with the
Prince, for two reasons: In a drunken
frolic at Brighton, he had received the
honour of being thrown into a gravel∣pit,
by which means he broke his leg;
but as his neck was entire, he did not
much lament the fracture, since it was
a kind of claim on princely patronage;
and the other reason was, that the Re∣verend
Ephraim Dandelion was a person
of inimitable talent, in imitating the bray
of an ass and the whine of a pig. The
ass and the pig, with the above-men∣tioned
dash into the gravel-pit, procured
him an honorary place in the Prince's
army of Chaplains. This honour brings
with it the useful privilege of enabling
the possessor to hold as many livings as
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
he can get, while it comfortably relieves
him of the tedious duty of residence; so
the happy Ephraim, aspiring now to a
Bishoprick, never more entered the pa∣lace
of his Bishop.</P>
<P>Although we know of no facts (for of
facts should all true histories like the
present consist) that might tend to ac∣cuse
him of any venial liberalities to his
miserable curates, yet he was well ena∣bled
to commit such follies; for he now
held, in livings and <HI>ceteras,</HI> above two
thousand a year, according to his own
frequent avowal, and little less he ex∣pected
from the worthy Rector his fa∣ther,
who was of a most plethoric habit,
was a Gargantua in point of stomach,
one of the most orthodox venison eaters
in his county, and had been twice touched
by an apoplexy.</P>
<P>A character more singular and inte∣resting
was the voluptuous Sedley. A
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
passion for self-enjoyment was the source
of his actions; his life was a system of
refined Epicurism; his study was an art
to irritate desire, and to protract enjoy∣ment;
to throw over the nudities of
imagination a thin and brilliant veil,
woven by the Graces. He was born with
a sensitive heart and a romantic fancy,
but his natural benevolence was fre∣quently
sacrificed to his artificial grati∣fications;
yet of his dangerous talent,
his numerous victims rather murmured
than complained; their ruin seemed a∣dorned;
despair was half soothed by the
memory of it's past enjoyments; and,
at least, the sincerity of their master was
evinced in his having become his own
victim. His fortune and his felicity were
alike exhausted in the fatal ravages of
his passions; a dark vacuity in his heart
terrified his solitude; with all the fer∣vour
of affection he found he could not▪
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
love; with all the curious felicity of en∣joyment
he found he had never enjoyed;
enervated by the anguish of disappoint∣ment,
yet stimulated by the fever of hope,
he wandered in a tumultuous pursuit of
that pleasure, which, if fugitive, torment∣ed
with desire; and, if embraced, sickened
with satiety.</P>
<P>There was something grand and ro∣mantic
in his entire establishment. All
the luxuries of Europe were his domestic
enjoyments; every sense was flattered,
and the imagination itself was attempt∣ed,
to be satisfied. He held a corre∣spondence
with foreign parts, to import
every novelty of refined sensuality; and
the same ship often conveyed to him,
a picture of Raphael, a hogshead of
Montepulciano, and a female selected for
some peculiarity of seature. His houses
resounded with music; and all the arts
of amenity crouded to the opulent idler.
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
The heats of summer were cooled by the
ices of winter; and his winter garden was
prodigal of the roses of summer. Every
day he religiously gratified his five senses.
It was this Englishman of whom Mercier
relates, that he boasted of having ac∣quired
a sixth sense. It consisted in the
singular fancy of assembling females, who
resembled by their features the beauties
of other times. He dispersed through∣out
Europe portraits of his ancient fa∣vourites;
and sometimes prolonged his
mornings with the Scottish Mary and
Anne Bullen, and sometimes was seated
at supper between Cleopatra and Poppaea.
The illusion was still further promoted by
preserving their <HI>costume,</HI> and dressing every
beauty according to the country and the
age she personified.</P>
<P>In his country retreat he was charmed
by an Arcadian taste, and realized the
romance of the golden age. There he
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
would habit himself as a shepherd, and
walking by the side of a stage-dancer, his
favourite sultana, while she played on a
little harp, he held a crook in his hand,
a basket at his side, and wore a straw hat
wreathed with roses. In the semblance
of peace and enjoyment, he wandered
through the winding alleys of spring, and
disported in the rich shrubberies of his
ground. His companions at distance war∣bled
their tenderest airs, and the sympho∣nies
of musical instruments responded to
the harp of his shepherdess. Nightingales,
trained for this purpose, issued from their
nests, and settling, some near the fantasti∣cal
Arcadian, and some on the harp of
his mistress, rivalled her provoking me∣lodies,
fluttered, fainted, and fell at her
feet.</P>
<P>To such puerilities can descend the in∣ordinate
indulgence of an ungoverned
fancy; and in vain will the incredulous,
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
in his circumscribed experience, censure
these instances, as the ideal pictures of an
author's heated fancy, since these are facts
sanctioned by their truth; and others, not
of an inferior extravagance, not long ago
amused the tedium of the existence of a
noble Lord.</P>
<P>But in Sedley, his puerilities were not
unaccompanied with taste, nor was his
voluptuousness inhuman and void of ele∣vation.
Voluptuousness had made him no
otherwise to be condemned, than in those
seducing powers, and those brilliant illu∣sions,
which betrayed the sensibility of the
feminine heart. The voluptuousness of a
woman can never be pardoned; chastity
is like a seal to a rich casket, which, while
preserved entire, we know can never have
been pillaged of it's gems. Sensuality is
masculine, for it is gross; let the crime
and the punishment be reserved for man.
Sedley was, otherwise, the friend of hu∣man
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
nature, and loved the enjoyments of
others, because to him it was an enjoyment.
But when, at certain intervals, his senses
were exhausted, recollection obtruded it∣self
on his startled mind; it came in the
wan form of satiety, that spectre of de∣parted
pleasure! The images of those he
had rendered miserable, of some the sui∣cides,
and of others the lives, gave to his
repentant heart the pains themselves had
experienced. The gay Sedley shed the
bitterest tears in silence; and he mourned
at once the unhappiness of his compa∣nions
and his own. "I am a wretch,"
he would say, "but not from the malice
of my heart, but from it's pervading soft∣ness;
I perish with those that I have lost,
and I have not inflicted one pang on
others, which I would not bear myself—Not I! but Nature is inhuman; I listen
to her voice, the wanderings of my heart
are her inspirations, and if she betrays
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
those whom she conducts, who can wres∣tle
with the divinity of Nature? She has
given too few senses, and too numerous
desires; and nature forms herself the tor∣turing
scourge, that affrights and afflicts
the gentlest of the human race!" Such
was the character, and such the reflec∣tions
of Sedley.</P>
<P>At a morning visit to Miss Million,
Emily, not being present, became the sub∣ject
of their animadversions.</P>
<P>"She is certainly a d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/> fine girl,
only too modest," said the Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion.</P>
<P>"O!" exclaimed Miss Million, "you
can't conceive what vast pleasure it has
given me, to have found out the old blind
Lieutenant's daughter. When I saw her
at Exmouth, I repeatedly pressed her
with invitations to Portman-square, but
never expected to see the poor thing.
There she was quite solitary and timid.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="68"/>
"We shall then beat her hollow,"
cried Dandelion, "for a hare is soli∣tary
and timid, but yields as fine sport
as a fox."</P>
<P>"She is a delicious creature!" cried
Sedley.</P>
<P>"The most amiable and accomplished!"
said Lady Belfield.</P>
<P>"The most fascinating!" said Vaurien.</P>
<P>"I think" gravely observed Charles, "she will be in some danger among
us all."</P>
<P>"What danger, Sir?" sharply repri∣manded
Lady Belfield. "I will answer
for you positively. A young woman is
never in danger in the great world, among
the most polished part of society. We
do not blazon forth every casual indis∣cretion;
an honourable silence protects a
woman; while in your plebeian circles,
the slightest gallantries are construed into
unpardonable levities; the most agreeable
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
fleurettes are supposed to be declarations
of love; and if an assignation should be
discovered, the whole family, venerable
papa, the little sister, and the tall brother,
and the whole generation take the alarm.
A duel and a divorce complete the vulgar
farce; nothing less will do than an abso∣lute
Lucretia! whose history no one cre∣dits
more than Curtius leaping into the
great gulf."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Lady Belfield," replied Miss
Million, "I had forgot to mention to you,
that half of Mr. Charles' merits are lost in
his morality. What is meant by this same
morality? I am sure it gives no know∣ledge
of the world; for Lord Chester∣field's
divine works they say are immoral,
and the insupportable Rambler they say
is a very moral work. But, Lord! don't
let us talk of morality! it always brings
on my nervous complaint. I do not know
what to do with myself this whole day.
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
(the yawned) I wish I had some new
place to go to."</P>
<P>"Just now," said Vaurien, "the Lord
Mayor's show is setting off from the Man∣sion-house.
What do you think of a ride
to the city?"</P>
<P>"O, vulgar!" cried Miss Million, "I
never drive into the city but on Sundays;
the streets are so narrow, and the carts are
so broad! But what does your Ladyship
think of this show?"</P>
<P>"I am quite disengaged, Miss Million,"
said Lady Belfield.</P>
<P>"Why then we'll set off directly. Well,
but my dear Vaurien, what shall we do
after the show?"</P>
<P>"Trust to good fortune! There is the
wax-work in Fleet-street."</P>
<P>"Absolutely childish! What thinks
your Ladyship?"</P>
<P>"It would be so great a novelty to me,
that I am sure I should be pleased."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71"/>
"Well, then we'll go to the wax-work
in Fleet-street" said Miss Million. "I
dare say it will be in all the papers to∣morrow.
Then where can we pass two
hours more? I can't think of coming
home to dress till five. Then, from five
to seven are my two regular desperate
hours; 'tis a melancholy interval of time,
when one is quite dress'd for dinner, and
wishes for it, without appetite, merely to
see company. All the nobility are mise∣rable
from five to seven."</P>
<P>"I have many!" cried Vaurien, "The
ventriloquist, and the stone-eater; the
Corsican fairy, and the Polish dwarf.
There's a collection of Chinese curiosities;
three monsters, with throats as large as
their bodies; a full-grown elephant; and
a lap-dog, which may be put in a snuff∣box,
going to be shipped off for the Dutch
governor of Batavia; and, above all, there
is a <HI>poupée</HI> of Madame Tallien, who now
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
reigns like the Queen of France, and
which is just brought over by a French
milliner, as a model of the present Parisian
fashion; not three persons in town have
seen it! the dress is richly fanciful, and
perfectly in the old Roman style; the
breasts uncovered, one side of the robe
drawn up, which delightfully exhibits
the whole leg, and a little higher; it
is the most voluptuous and most brilliant
dress."</P>
<P>"Delightful!" exclaimed Miss Million,
"let us set off."</P>
<P>"My dear friend," said Sedley, "pray
give me the address, that I may have
a copy of the poupee of Madame Tal∣lien."</P>
<P>Emily now entering, was invited by
Miss Million to the whole circle of these
morning amusements; but she pleaded
indisposition, and the company retired.
Sedley, however, gave up the poupee of
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
Madame Tallien, for the present moment,
and returning into the breakfast-room,
found himself alone with Emily. It was
a moment he had long desired, but which
had hitherto eluded his attempts. What
passed between our amiable heroine and
our refined voluptuary, is, perhaps, enti∣tled
to the honours of a separate chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Conversation with a philosophical
Voluptuary.</HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE brought," said Sedley, as
he returned, "a version of my fa∣vourite
poet; here it is, Miss Emily,
for you was it composed; but even you
have failed to inspire me with the deli∣cacy
and amenity of the voluptuous Ana∣creon
of France. <HI>L'Art d'Aimer</HI> of Ber∣nard
cannot be translated, at least permit
me thus to console my own inability.
Could you but catch the seductive graces
of the original, I should trace, in the
touching languor of your eye, the en∣chantment
of your heart. He is the Al∣bano
of poetry. In his amiable minia∣tures
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
he paints the playful triumphs or
the children of love; fervid, yet chaste;
true, yet flattering. It is only nature
embellished.</P>
<P>"Bernard was my friend, as well as mas∣ter;
he was the most amiable man at the
most amiable court. An arbiter elegan∣tiarum
in the most refined circles at Pa∣ris;
the art of pleasing in conversation was
still more sensibly felt than the art of de∣lighting
by his graceful and dissolving
verse. Voltaire considered him as a pro∣digy
of elegant voluptuousness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In noticing Saint Bernard, and another Bernard celebrated for his wealth, he adds,
<Q><L>Le troisieme est l'enfant de Phébus,</L>
<L><HI>Gentil Bernard,</HI> dont la Muse feconde,</L>
<L>Doit saire encore les delices du monde,</L>
<L>Quand des premiers on ne parlera plus.</L><BIBL>VOLTAIRE</BIBL></Q></P></NOTE>. His
verses respire a continued softness, are
gay with a thousand pictures, and are the
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
enamellings of poetry. In his manners,
what easy, yet resistless grace! No man
had so much of that light flower of taste
which blooms but for a rapid moment,
those brilliant colours that fade while we
gaze on them. Ah! that any thing of
Bernard should be perishable!"</P>
<P>"Mr. Sedley," interrupted Emily, "I
love all kinds of enthusiam; but in this
case, as you labour with great perplexity
to describe your master, tell me at once
he was an effeminate, refined, and lively
Frenchman."</P>
<P>"For your sex his passion was excessive;
but he was inconstant; and yet, Miss Emi∣ly,
he was beloved. Not a Parisian beau∣ty
complained of his infidelities; for the
charms of his genius they pardoned the
wanderings of his heart; and he censures
his own inconstancies with such gaiety, that
they seem to be only so many triumphs.</P>
<P>"I know not how it happened, but poor
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
Bernard survived himself. In my last re∣sidence
at Paris, I found the voluptuous
poet a mere shadow of existence; and he
who had charmed by the lightness and
the tenderness of his effusions, was then a
mute idiot. I have been at the opera
with him when they performed his own
admirable Castor and Pollux. He gazed
with a vacant eye, and we could draw no
other conversation from him than inces∣sant
enquiries if his Majesty was satis∣fied?
If Madame de Pompadour was
pleased? Courtier to the last, the royal
favour was the solitary sentiment that oc∣cupied
the insensate idiot. Ah! Miss
Emily, it was an humiliation for the man
of pleasure and the man of wit, to view
their gay and amiable chief with eyes
that distilled unmeaning tears, an exani∣mate
frame that sat motionless, and whose
voice could not utter an expression but
which confirmed his idiotism."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78"/>
"The title of his poem," observed
Emily, "is to me a condemning criti∣cism.
I should be very sorry, I assure
you, to be <HI>taught</HI> an "Art of Love." I
fear it is a misfortune for most in these
times to be in love without art. But by
your account of Bernard I am much gra∣tified;
you know I am delighted by a
moral tale, and I think your's is ex∣tremely
moral; it is a true and melan∣choly
picture of those foolish wits, who,
abandoned to the fury of their passions,
are not less pernicious to themselves than
to their neighbours. Since you have
printed this dangerous poem, have the
candour to give this last anecdote of Ber∣nard's
life, as a preface or a postscript.
Mr. Sedley will believe me, when I say I
am not fastidiously moral; I do not con∣sider
every deviation from our own ac∣customed
habits to be turpitude, or even
error. I have seen prudes grow outrage∣ous
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
at freedoms with their persons, which
I should consider as very inoffensive. If
I were in France, where, I am told, the
ladies indulge in many familiarities, more
harmless than they seem, I think I should
only consider them as local customs. But
libertinism, Mr. Sedley, in whatever form
it comes, whether it be gay with the spi∣rits
of youth, or vapid with the tremors
of age, adorned by the charms of verse, or
systematized by the philosophy of prose, is
irreconcilable to my feelings. I will not
look for the reasons that may have ex∣cited
its abhorrence; it is enough for me,
that it's inspection raises a disgust so na∣tural
and energetic, that I lose my pa∣tience
when I seek for reasons. I do
not know that I could give any satisfac∣tory
reason why I prefer perfumes to
ordures, but that my organs are so framed
as to be attracted by the one, and to be
repulsed by the other. In these cases,
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
the best reason will be, in not attempting
to reason; as, to return to your poem, all
my art of love will, I hope, be, to have
no art at all."</P>
<P>"A slight misconception, not a differ∣ence
in opinion, amiable Miss Emily!
has afforded you this vindictive exulta∣tion.
How justly you observe, that there
are rapid sensations which are so natural
as not to exact the frigid and impotent
efforts of an inactive reason. Do not
form such serious, such gloomy notions
of love; look not on it's innocent plea∣sures
with the melancholy eye of reason.
You have been told, that the desires of
love are crimes, but they are only amuse∣ments;
you consider him as a tyrant or a
traitor, but he is only an amiable boy;
he exacts but one gentle concession, so
well expressed by Thomson, when he
says—
<Q><PB N="78" REF="81"/>
<L>Thought meeting thought, and will prevent∣ting
will,</L>
<L>With boundless confidence—</L></Q>
It is this submissive sentiment, tender and
ingenuous; prompt, yet durable; ar∣dent,
yet continued that diffuses the
soul in the senses; and, fertile and eager
in desire, lives and increases on the o'er∣flowing
lap of pleasure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Sedley is repeating in prose what his friend Ber∣nard
has sung in verse:—
<Q><L>Ce sentiment soumis, tendre, ingénu,</L>
<L>Prompt, mais durable; ardent, mais soutenu—</L>
<L>Ce trait de feu gui des yeux passe à l'ame,</L>
<L>De l'ame aux sens; qui fecond en desirs,</L>
<L>Dure, et s'augmente, au comble des plaisirs.</L></Q></P></NOTE>. Who more
modest and retired than a sensitive lover?
In shade and in silence are all the surtive
caresses of love received. Love is a se∣cret
enjoyment, it admits of no partici∣pation;
it is for the applause of his mis∣tress,
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
and not for that of the world, a lover
pants.</P>
<P>"Lament then with me, my dear Miss
Emily, the prejudices of our age and our
country; how rarely does love unite two
hearts in the sanctioned pleasures of ma∣trimony!
The conjugal couch we con∣sider
as polluted, when two congenial
spirits meet—but meet too late; and
should they love as nature dictates to the
heart, we reproach them, we disgrace
them, we harass them with the iron ma∣nacles
of law. Unnatural laws, but most
natural loves! How often have I wished
to have been an inmate of those countries
which we call barbarous, but which I ad∣mire,
as the only regions where nature is
not offended by the haughty temerity of
man! O! happy people, where the lover
composes his fragrant letter with the
freshest flowers; where the yellow jonquil
tells his despair; the crimson rose, the
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
consenting blushes of his beloved; and
the chaste lily, the consummation of his
amatory hopes. Nor do the Canadians,
with a concise rudeness, experience per∣haps
inferior delight, when they send a
lighted match to their mistress, and if
she blows it, they are happy. But pre∣cipitated
love loses half it's pleasures.
Sweet and romantic is the varied interval
between desire and enjoyment. The de∣light
of the chace is not in it's game, but
it's pursuit. Let a bashful mistress be
capricious, be cruel, be every thing; but
let her at length be kind. We claim but
the reward of industry, a holiday in the
toiling year of slavery</P>
<P>"If we listen to Nature, can we err?
"To enjoy is to obey," declares your
own poet of reason. And what is the
arid uniformity of life, but a dull and
unmeaning passage, unless some transient
roses are scattered at our feet? Our ex∣istence
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
is derived from our senses; corpo∣real
sensibility is the source of our pas∣sions,
the motive of our thought, the
magnet of our sociability; and, in one
word, it is our misery or our enjoyment.
Nature never relinquishes our heart; it's
emotions custom may pervert, and rea∣son
may condemn. But to the tremb∣lingly
alive how tedious is custom! how
dismal is reason! Ah! reason, Miss
Emily, what is reason? nothing but a
prevailing system of opinions, which in
time are mutilated and reversed, and
which, directed merely by accidental cus∣toms,
is various in every people. Rea∣son
is compelled to elaborate with ter∣rible
pangs, system upon system, and de∣stroys
itself, in it's attempts of self-pre∣servation;
and when a man is devoid of
sensibility, he is considered to be the
ablest dialectician. Now, if sensibility is
but the soft workings of nature, mark
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
how unnatural is reason! But pleasure,
that is, sensibility gratified, is the sponta∣neous
effusion of nature; it's language is
universal, it's actions are uniform; the
same at the burning line as on the icy
Alps. Our senses are the porches of na∣ture,
ever open to all our pleasures; rea∣son
magisterially would close them; but
these veins are the canals of delight, and
would you freeze them? Reason may
make a conquest, but Pleasure alone can
be loved, for she is the enchanting and
the native sovereign of the heart."</P>
<P>To this subtile and tedious philoso∣phy
Emily patiently listened, and then
replied. "Alas! Sir, why do you em∣ploy
your talents in a cause so feeble,
and yet so dangerous? All that you have
beautifully said cannot conceal the dis∣gusting
reality; it is only spreading the
variegated hues of the rainbow on the
filthy webs of spiders. I answer you,
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
however, that reason, melancholy as you
term it, is my pleasure. I therefore agree
with you, that I should loath existence,
did not indulge my pleasure. Reason
is immutable, for it is truth. I acknow∣ledge
that there exists a false, as well as
a true reason; as there is a pleasure that
is true, and another which is false. It is
therefore not difficult to describe the one,
while we are only alluding to the other;
and, perhaps, had I not been rather sin∣gular
in my habits of life, and my taste
for reading, I might have been deluded
in listening to you; I might have mistak∣en
a false and spurious pleasure, for that
which alone is true and durable. Consider,
therefore, the wickedness of propagating
maxims which all may listen to with
pleasure, while few can discriminate with
judgment."</P>
<P>"Dear Miss Emily, it is you who
form sophisms. Why will you call rea∣son
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
pleasure, and it's variance, immuta∣bility?
Is that pleasure, that commands
an abstinence from enjoyment, and which
is frequently known to communicate an
antipathy of existence? No, not all the
propositions of Locke can change one
organ that inebriates the heart. And is
this reason immutable, which is variable
as the heavens, and as changeable in a
people as in an individual? When rea∣son
flies to the cloister, does pleasure fol∣low?
When the anchorite shuts up the
human heart, what remains but the wan∣ing
spectre of man? Pure and trace∣less
is the pliability of pleasure, pure and
traceless as this kiss!" He took her hand,
and raised it to his inclining lips. It was
done with such modesty and gentleness,
that Emily could not be angry; she was
only confused.</P>
<P>"Mr. Sedley," she said, "I know
these freedoms are considered rather as
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
favours done to us; but allow me to in∣dulge
my own sensations. I have lived
in retirement; I cannot grant such in∣sidious
liberties. You would not, I am
sure, be satisfied with that poor gratifica∣tion
of seizing from an unprotected fe∣male
that which she must not refuse, and
will not grant."</P>
<P>"Heaven forbid, my charming Miss
Emily, angel as you are, in mind as in
form! Pleasure is no solitary gratifica∣tion,
it is a dividual enjoyment; if you
are miserable, I therefore cannot be
happy. Alas! you persist in refusing
the supreme felicity of a chaste voluptu∣ousness;
in preferring the spiritless re∣pose
of life, to that enchantment which
gives to one day the existence of an
age, the deliciousness of mutual posses∣sion.
But recollect, that with the indul∣gence
of this chaste voluptuousness, no
virtue refuses to be united; and such
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
amiable women have adorned society,
and cherished the duties of humanity.
I must not quit you without repeating
Saint Evremond's charming and philo∣sophical
inscription for Ninon de L'En∣clos;
I can give it you almost lite∣rally:—<Q><L>Nature with sage indulgence formed</L>
<L>NINON'S enchanting soul, and gazed!</L>
<L>With EPICURUS' softness warmed,</L>
<L>And with a CATO'S virtue raised<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The original is thus:—
<Q><L>L'indulgente et sage Nature,</L>
<L>A formé l'ame de NINON,</L>
<L>De la volupté d'EPICURE,</L>
<L>Et de la vertu de CATON.</L></Q></P></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>When the philosophic voluptuary quit∣ted
Emily, he placed his poem in a book
she had been reading, unperceived by
her, and she now retired to dress. Mrs.
Bully soon afterwards entered, and her
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
curious and inquisitorial eye, always ex∣ercised
on the appearance of a volume,
unfortunately discovered in Emily's this
"Art of Love." "A pretty title in∣deed,"
she exclaimed, "for a modest
young lady! Yet Miss Emily can't
read the Bible because of some amorous
histories, which "she began, but would
never finish." A curse on such Socinian∣ism!"
Here she turned over the leaves,
and then cried out, "Lord save us!
here's a description of two newly-mar∣ried
lovers on the morning couch of Hy∣men,
which I suppose only means a bed.
What's this?—<Q><L>Thou sleep'st, Zelida, I enjoy alone!</L>
<L>Soft o'er thy form one living blush is thrown.</L>
<L>Awake to pleasure with the morning beam!</L>
<L>Ah! while I view thee, thou but view'st some
dream!</L>
<L>He sighed—Zelida hears! her eyes expand!</L>
<L>Tremulous she sighs, and lifts her timid hand;</L>
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
<L>Nor dares withdraw it! Hylas gently guides,</L>
<L>In each warm vein the tenderest tremor glides.</L>
<L>They joined their lips of flame with fainting bliss;</L>
<L>Their souls divided in the ethereal kiss!</L></Q></P>
<P>"Abominable! 'tis n't fit to be read
by a Christian! Very well, Miss Emily!
Not fit to be read!" So saying, she
snatched the poem, hurried to her cham∣ber,
sat down, and having quite read it
through, locked it up in one of her se∣cret
drawers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Loving by Anticipation. A Year of
Patronage.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE, in it's earliest stage, has a
variety of ways of exhibiting itself.
There is love at first sight, which we ob∣serve
to be a very fashionable and expe∣ditious
manner with some of our living
novelists; yet I cannot applaud them for
any invention in this respect. To detect
the finest foldings of the human heart, is
the pleasing skill of us domestic biogra∣phers.
Then, there is love without love,
by which we understand the Platonic af∣fection;
but what a ridiculous figure
would the amiable boy make, if he were
to hold in his hand an useless torch with∣out
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
a flame, which, we are inclined to
think, is the chimerical flambeau which
every Platonist waves. But the most re∣markable,
and, we conceive, the most in∣genious
kind of love, is when we are per∣fectly
enamoured of a person, whom we
have never seen, and of whom we have
never heard. It is a kind of love to
which we are extremely partial, having
ourselves formed a hundred delightful
miseries of such deliciousness; pleasures
of which, assuredly, only exquisite ge∣nius,
or exquisite madness, has ever felt
the inebriation. A Spanish hero, in one
of the plays of Calderon, to apologize for
his most fervent, but most sudden passion,
observes, that he loved his mistress before
he knew her, because he was fated to
love her. Others, the very Caesars of love,
may exclaim, I saw, I loved, I conquered!
but then such a happy victory will more
depend on the heroine than the hero; unless
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
the latter should possess a brilliant enqui∣page,
a noble mansion, and a noble income;
and in that predicament, the hero may
justly attribute his triumph entirely to
himself. But of the kind of love which
we form for a person quite unknown to
us, the most pleasing instance is that of
the once famous Zayde, who by the
means of an unknown portrait, hung in
her father's gallery, felt a most vehe∣ment
passion for her lover, about twenty
years before ever she saw him; so that,
without any violation of decency, she
might have thrown herself into his arms
at the very first moment they met; but,
unfortunately, when she met the man she
so ardently loved, she passed several years
in his society, which a resolution not to
love him, because she loved his picture,
which it is evident was not necessary for
her to know was his picture, till the last
page of that romance.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95"/>
Among this class of lovers by anticipa∣tion,
we must place our good Charles;
for he was fond of Emily, and his heart
palpitated warmly at the sound of her
name, long before their first accidental
interview at Mrs. Wilson's; he loved
without having seen her; for he loved
her most affectionately for her filial piety,
and her patient sufferings; but when he
saw her, to love is but a poverty of con∣ception,
to designate with precision the
tumult that rushed on his heart, that
made him inactive in the day, and restless
in the night. With Emily, the grand
affair of love was far different; as she had
not any equal impulses to love Charles
before she saw him, when she did see him
the passion grew by slow gradations; she
was averse to indulge the susceptibility
of her heart; she had a latent propen∣sity
to a dangerous infection, rather than
that she felt the immedicable disorder.
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
To gain the full possession of her virtuous
heart, it was necessary to merit it; and
as such opportunities do not easily occur,
(at least in true histories like the present)
it was long before she perceived the just
claim of Charles to that valued gift.
And when she began to love, most unfor∣tunately
it occurred, that she was obliged
to dread, and to hate, as we purpose
shortly to detail.</P>
<P>Emily entered the parlour one day,
followed by the Reverend Ephraim Dan∣delion.
She flung open the door with a
hasty violence, unusual with her mild
manners; her face was one blush; her
whole frame one disorder. "Heavens!
what is the matter, child?" enquired
Miss Million. "Nothing, Madam;" re∣plied
the confused Emily, "but Mr.
Dandelion, I presume, will be taught to
respect himself, or me, for the future. As
it assuredly will not be repeated, it would
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
be giving it too much importance to re∣member
it."</P>
<P>"Well, but what was it Emily? I
dare say some country joke of our young
bishop."</P>
<P>Dandelion replied: "Miss Emily is so
touchy, that she takes fire as easily as the
wadding of my gun, or as a little field
of furze. What the deuce can a man do
with his hands more inoffensively, than to
arrange the tucker of a charming girl?
True, my hand slipped; and Miss Emily
was in such an agitation, that, d<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e,
she frightened me."</P>
<P>The eyes of Charles darted fire; they
were fixed on Dandelion. The Reverend
Ephraim most probably caught them, for
he bent his head, and employed himself
in pulling the straps of his boots. Emily
marked the full direction of Charles's fer∣vid
eyes; she felt an emotion of gratitude
and alarm.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98"/>
"Indeed, is that all?" said Miss Mil∣lion,
bridling, with a look which she di∣vided
between the plaintiff and the de∣fendant,
but which might be discrimi∣nated,
by an analyzer of a look, into an
insulting sneer for Emily, and a jealous
reproach for Ephraim. "I advise you,
child, that if such harmless freedoms are
to occasion such violent resentments, to
hide yourself from the figure of a man.
But you have seen so little of the great
world, that such <HI>gaucheté</HI> of manners
must be the consequence. But I do not
see, Mr. Dandelion, what you have to do
with Miss Emily!"</P>
<P>"Mr. Dandelion," observed Vaurien,
"would do well, when he thrusts his
hands into a rose-bush, to take care of
not scratching himself with the briers.
I wish, my good friend, the tucker had
been well armed at all points. You have
had but a bloodless victory, and have
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
taken the outworks without even the apo∣logy
of a siege."</P>
<P>"You country gentlemen," said Sedley,
"are most robust in your refinements;
you crush in your embrace, and your rap∣tures
annihilate delicate nerves. 'Tis all
bussing at a gossip's christening. I think
you are the only respectable part of the com∣munity
who perpetuate the venerable kissing
of Queen Besse's days, or her good father,
whose kisses, I think, generally concluded
with blows. I believe a woman conceives
a kiss from a country gentleman full as
dreadful as a tug or a shake. You are all
for overflowing bumpers; no matter what
wine! You have done, in the turning of
a lock, what a sensitive man would have
taken three years about."</P>
<P>"D<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="_+"/>e," said Dandelion, "you all
set me, like a pack in full cry. I am sure
I am sorry to have offended Miss Emily;
but I never yet offended by a little play."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="100"/>
"Play, Sir," continued Sedley, "why
it is coming to blows! I fear Miss Emily
has received some marks from your cud∣gelling
arms. I know a friend, Mr. Dan∣delion,
who is a man of sensibility and re∣finement,
and who has now paid his de∣voirs,
to an amiable woman, these twelve
years; he never passed an evening with her
but in the company of a third person; he
admires her musick, she admires his verses.
He was seven years before he kissed her
hand; but to have touched her tucker—Sir, as soon would he;—but I'll say no
more."</P>
<P>When the company broke up, Charles
took Dandelion aside, and said: "Miss
Emily Balfour I am sorry to see in this
house, without a protector. Such, I ima∣gine,
she cannot want long; but, till
she has a protector, we should all of us
consider it as our indispensable duty to
perform that office. You, however, do not.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="101"/>
If you would consult your own ease, I
must insist that you never offer to give
pain to that Lady, by a single word, or a
single action."</P>
<P>"So ho, young squire!" whistled
Dandelion, "<HI>you</HI> are the protector of
Miss Emily! Who gave you this
right?"</P>
<P>"My humanity. I do not mean to in∣terchange
any conversation. To a person
of your character conviction must be
brought by other means. Mr. Dandelion,
my father was a clergyman; it is an awful
profession; and he who seems ashamed of
it, has attained a degree of depravity
which I think is quite of a recent date."
So saying, he gave a violent shake to his
cropt hair and braided tail; for when
our young parson was in town, his cle∣rical
encircling curl was twisted into an
elegant tail, sustained by a tortoiseshell
comb.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102"/>
"And pray, Sir," calmly demanded
Dandelion, "what can you mean by
this?"</P>
<P>"Perhaps you may understand me bet∣ter
now," said Charles, repeating the ac∣tion,
to the utter discomfiture of his
fashionable crop, while the braided tail
hung dishevelled on his back.</P>
<P>"I believe you mean to insult me!"</P>
<P>"Precisely so. I have now only in∣sulted
you; but, mean as you are, the
next time you do not escape correction."</P>
<P>While this short dialogue was passing
between Charles and Ephraim, the door
had been left a-jar, and the maid of Emi∣ly,
in passing, had been attracted by the
firm tones of Charles. The whole scene
was revealed. Through the magnifying
glass of her eye she examined every mo∣tion,
and, in a very poetical amplification
of our hero's concise prose, she detailed
the whole to Emily; who, when the ter∣rible
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
description was closed, rejoiced to
find that the duel was a bloodless en∣counter.
Charmed by the modest, the
sensible, and concealed manner, which
Charles had chosen to protect her, this
action was repaid, by her little heart, with
more than gratitude.</P>
<P>In this manner Emily passed six months
in the house of Miss Million, much to
her dissatisfaction. The refinement of
Sedley was insidious; the brutality of
Dandelion disgusted; the interest she
took in Vaurien was censurable; and the
growing affection she felt for Charles was
imprudent. Miss Million had now heard
her so frequently applauded by every one,
and particularly since the attack of the
Reverend Ephraim on the fair bosom of
our heroine, that she began to feel weary
of a girl who carried the whole weight of
attention to her side. Her displeasure
gleamed through several obscure hints
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
dropped to Mrs. Betty her waiting-maid,
who blew the gleams into a kitchen flame.
They met a most terrible bellows in the
mouth of Mrs. Bully, who, besides accu∣sations
of Socinianism, whispered in close
secrets, and talked in imperfect surmises,
that she had made a most important de∣tection
of the loose morals of Miss Emily.
This part of her accusation agitated the cu∣riosity
of the lower part of the house; and
a most unfortunate circumstance, which
then happened, confirmed all the foul ac∣cusations
of the orthodox and benevolent
Mrs. Bully.</P>
<P>Emily now viewed the altered features
of patronage; she saw herself the de∣pendant
of a mean, an unfeeling, and an
uneducated woman of fashion. To her
sensations every look was reproach, every
expression contempt, and every civility
insult. Not that Miss Million uttered
her vulgar sentiments in their clear and
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
appropriate language; but, to the lumi∣nous
sensibility of Emily, the sordid heart
of Miss Million lay open; and her sensi∣tive
soul now shivered, in all the varying
seasons of a year of patronage. It was
now she perceived that she had not re∣garded
the counsel of her father, in seek∣ing
her independence from herself; she
saw her existence in sorrow or in pleasure,
as the face of her patroness chose. Com∣pletely
miserable, and humiliated in her
own mind, she felt herself unprotected,
and knew not wher to find a refuge.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Vaurien's Friendships.</HEAD>
<P>THE friendship of Charles for Vau∣rien
had become indissoluble. Some
opinions, which the Gaul had at first
thrown out, alarmed him; but he consi∣dered
them only as those dangerous para∣doxes,
peculiar to the intemperate philo∣sophers
of his country; nor was Charles
a little delighted, by perceiving the energy
of his own eloquence, operating on the
superior intellect of Vaurien, who had
gradually relinquished his own notions,
one by one, and, at present, seemed only
a mere reflection of the pure and honest
Charles. He reposed on the bosom of this
cherished friend; his virtues daily excited
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
admiration; and none so much as his ex∣traordinary
liberalities, since his late remit∣tances
from France, which, as he informed
his friends, he had been so fortunate as to
receive. To Vaurien, Charles poured his se∣cret
sorrows; he touched mournfully on the
dissipations of Lady Belfield, and lamented
the contempt he hourly received from his
former gentle patroness. "As for my Lord,
you acknowledge," said he, "that he is ob∣stinately
lost to reason, and an enemy to
that constitution which protects his person
and his property; which must be slowly
reformed, not rapidly destroyed; united
closer, not disorganised. In vain I wil∣lingly
yield some principles, which I deem
political superstitions; but, in return, he
yields me not one opinion, however fan∣tastic,
however destructive. He and his
party would innovate all things; but my
Lord does not agree with Mr. Subtile,
Mr. Subtile with Mr. Dragon, nor Mr.
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
Sympathy with Dr. Bounce. Philosophy
has it's prejudices, not less pernicious, not
less inhuman, than the popular prejudices
of the most intolerant people. And at
what aims this philosophy? In forming a
man without a heart! It is of no conse∣quence
to me, whether a persecuting re∣ligion
burns me in an auto-da-fe, or whe∣ther
a persecuting philosophy conducts
me to the guillotine; it is always the
same thing for my neck."</P>
<P>To similar conversations Vaurien had
not only given his approbation, but ex∣pressed
his surprise that a free Briton,
like Charles, should violate his dignity by
the dependence of patronage. "Grati∣tude,"
said he, "for the reception ac∣corded
to a foreign wanderer, still kept
him in the house of Belfield, but his day
of enfranchisement should not be far;
and he should rejoice to observe Charles
spurn his splendid, but ignoble chains;"
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
and for this purpose offered a liberal sup∣ply
of money. Charles felt grateful, and
only refused the offer through delicacy,
observing, "that whenever his patrons
should hint at a dismission, he would re∣joice
to accept it." "Tres bien," said
Vaurien, musing.</P>
<P>Lady Belfield was exasperated by the
insensibility of Charles; she had exhaust∣ed
her whole artillery, and she in vain
essayed to soften the human statue into
animation. She now suspected that his
heart was occupied by some rival. To her
confidential Vaurien she opened her sur∣mises;
their mutual passion had greatly
subsided, and, it it's height, it was a love
that knows no jealousy. Her Ladyship
and Vaurien would have mutually assisted
each other in procuring themselves new
lovers.</P>
<P>"Indeed," replied Vaurien to the en∣quiry,
"it is an insult to your Ladyship.
<PB N="107" REF="110"/>
Shall I dare to say, you have a rival, in
an abject being?"</P>
<P>"I desire, Vaurien," said her Ladyship,
reddening, "that you will inform me."</P>
<P>"I cannot; my indignation would pre∣serve
silence."</P>
<P>"Sensitive Vaurien! You anticipate
my feelings. I insist on knowing."</P>
<P>"He is my friend; you must grant
me the most inviolable secresy. Charles
is unworthy of your regard. Your ri∣val,"
added Vaurien, with a sneer half∣suppressed,
"is a low woman, picked
from the streets, and whom he has placed
in a petty shop." He gave the address of
Mrs. Wilson.</P>
<P>The face of Lady Belfield burned;
her eyes caught fire; and she said, scarce
audibly: "Is the wretch so low? How
humiliating the villain! His presence is
a reproach. Vaurien, he shall not remain
here."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111"/>
"At this house," continued Vaurien,
"Miss Balfour accidentally hired lodg∣ings.
He has taken me frequently to
this woman's; but the sweet Emily, for
whom you know I feel a passion, a pas∣sion
as yet ungratified, knows nothing of
her character."</P>
<P>"I have told you, Vaurien," replied
her Ladyship, "that I have already se∣cured
that dear girl to reside with us
some time. Receive that innocence with
gentleness; smile at least on the victim
of my friendship and your love. When
she bleeds, let me not hear her cries."</P>
<P>From this conversation Vaurien has∣tened
to his Lordship. With Belfield
he had for some time past engaged in
complicate conspiracies. "This morn∣ing,
my Lord," he said, "a trusty cou∣rier
has brought me letters from Brest.
Rowan O'Connor has secured Connaught.
We have a garrison of Defenders in all
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
the remote towns of Ireland. Surely po∣tatoes
are inflammable, the Irish are so
hot. Our party gains at Paris; the Ja∣cobins
are playing gently now with the
Moderés, but, rely on it, 'tis the young
tyger with his keeper, who attempted to
domesticate the animal, but when the
tyger knew his strength, he tossed about
the head of his keeper for his amusement.
An embarkation for England is prepar∣ing,
the coasts are lined with men; the
invasion is at no great distance; but your
Lordship wants patriotism, and this is the
only moment when all the Thames should
roll, like another Pactolus, on sands of
gold. Money is wanted in Ireland. Dra∣gon
holds a correspondence with almost
every town in England; we have all the
idle, the discontented, the bankrupts, and
the hot-brained youth of every town;
you see our party is formidable. Rant
has become an itinerant orator, and his
sixpenny eloquence scatters more sedi∣tion
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
among the lower classes than all the
money of your Lordship; he is quite
intelligible to them; ranting, roaring,
raving; he draws his metaphors from
the very gutters of the people; and so
far, like Virgil, as your Addison says,
the fellow tosses his dung about him
with some effect."</P>
<P>His Lordship listened with intense de∣light
to this rapid sketch of the Gaul.
What he barely touched on, his fertile
imagination expanded by anticipation.
Already, on the ruins of London, a com∣mittee
of public safety seemed to arise.
"Take all, my dear Vaurien, all I have
to give; but the dilatoriness of all those
projects, which you describe so rapidly,
has left me a ruined man. Mortgage
I cannot more, and for swindling I have
not sufficient credit. If this invasion of
England fails, where shall I fly?"</P>
<P>"France," replied Vaurien, "will be
proud to enrol the name of Belfield
<PB N="111" REF="114"/>
among it's English citizens; we have al∣ready
some British worthies of a kindred
merit. But I can proceed no further if
Charles remains in your house. I suspect
he is a ministerial spy."</P>
<P>"He shall have his dismission," said
his Lordship.</P>
<P>Such were the friendships of Vaurien;
yet at the very instant he evinced a sud∣den
ebullition of sympathy, which virtue
would have been proud to own. Pas∣sing
the hall, he observed a servant lad,
who had retired into a dark corner, and
seated on a bench, was weeping and sob∣bing.
"What has happened, William?"
enquired Vaurien.—"I have just re∣ceived
a letter, Sir, from my poor mo∣ther,
who tells me my father is dead.
He has been bed-ridden these ten years.
His death might have been borne, for
my poor mother could hardly support
herself and a helpless old man. But we
are both now in such despair, I cannot
<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
sleep at the thoughts; my father will
not have Christian burial; the creditors
insist first on being paid; the body is
detained, and heaven only knows where
my father's soul rests; it can never rest
surely if not buried in Christian ground.
Ah! Sir, I remember, that when the
great Methodist Surgeon of our village
anatomized the strong man that was
hanged for continually breaking out of
prison, he felt a qualm of conscience,
and employed me in the night to dig
a grave in the church-yard, that the
bones might be buried in holy ground;
for he, no doubt, could not answer to his
conscience if they had remained unburied.
If people are not buried in church ground,
what will become of their souls? My
mother is distracted, and I am afraid to
walk in the night." Vaurien smiled at
the artless tremors of the lad and his
mother, and quieted their holy horror
by his liberal assistance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Declaration of Love, not known to the
Lover.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE Emily's residence in Portman∣square,
although so long a time had
elapsed, Mrs. Wilson had not yet paid
her a visit. This separation had been
occasioned by misfortune, and not by
neglect. There are some beings who
seem selected by "outrageous Fortune,"
not only to receive the full weight of
her fatal "sling," but to be stuck round
by her harassing and petty "arrows."
Mrs. Wilson, in issuing one day for this
very purpose, either that really she had
been so closely confined at her industrious
counter, that she was quite a novice in
the art of walking the crouded streets,
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
or that, accustomed to indulge many
profound reveries of sorrow, she was ra∣ther
seen, than that she herself saw, she
had hardly cleared the view of her house,
when she encountered a porter, who▪ with
the full weight and the broad expansion
of a chest of tea, was equally oppressed as
blinded, yet unfortunately determined, at
the same time, to be rapid in his motions;
so that the exertion of sight entirely rested
on the passengers, and not on the porter.
The latter indeed proceeded rapidly, but
securely, for he was in no danger of be∣ing
reversed; but rushing round the cor∣ner
of a street where Mrs. Wilson had
arrived, at that very nicety of point of
turning when the two future contenders
are perfectly unperceived by each other—in not half a second of time—the por∣ter
rounded, and Mrs. Wilson fell! It
proved no trifling fracture, and she had
<PB N="115" REF="118"/>
hitherto been confined to her house.
Emily had more than once called on her,
had sympathized, and found her more
estimable at every interview; yet her fa∣ther's
suspicions had made in indelible
impression on her mind; and prompt as
she was at the tender call of friendship,
suspicion made her rather tremble than
enjoy.</P>
<P>When this poor woman found herself
in a state of convalescence, she came im∣mediately
to her young friend. "I hope,
Miss Emily," she said, "your situation
is agreeable."</P>
<P>"Alas! Mrs. Wilson," Emily replied,
"if it is not, I must attribute it to my
present state of feeling. Every scene
takes much, and sometimes all it's effect,
from our existing ideas. I feel, that if
I were in an Elysium it would appear
gloomy. In the image of my father,
there is yet too much life for me quietly
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
to remember that it has ceased to exist,
his minutest habits, and his accustomed
phrases, still engage my affections; and
I gaze, on what I cannot view, and I
listen, to what I cannot hear. To me he
is not dead! and I seem to live in the
cruel torments of an absence I never yet
knew, and cannot teach myself to suffer.
Consider, then, my present situation;
here is nothing but mirth and splendour,
and my heart is agitated by a perpetual
conflict of interiour misery, and exterior
gaiety. But with me the heart will ever
prevail over all it's constraints; it will
colour the scene I view, will prompt in my
sorrows the languor of my conversation,
and must ill fit me to be the companion of
Miss Million. Every day I feel I am an
intruder in this great house; and yet I
consider myself as it's humblest servant.
I sold my freedom when I united myself
to it's generous owner. Gratitude takes
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
from me the power of choice; otherwise,
much could I wish, my dear Mrs. Wil∣son,
that I still occupied the small room
of your small house; there I think I
could feel quietness, and to me quietness
seems an enjoyment; I almost think it
felicity. My independence would then
arise from myself; temperance would be
my gratification; useful, yet not un∣pleasing
occupations all my wealth, and
your conversation would constitute all
that I wish to hear of the world. When
I entered this superb mansion, I unthink∣ingly
violated the solemn injunction of my
dear father, who, as if he had been aware
of this splendid slavery, this silken chain,
told me only to derive my subsistence
from myself. Ah! if I were but once
more in your little room!—but what do
I say? There my father would sit before
me; every thing in your house would
remind me of his presence. The arm
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
chair would tell me where he twice
swooned, and the bed would for ever
revive his last, his affectionate, yet dig∣nified
hour! But these are foolish tears;
the unavailing tears of memory; yet is
their sweet sadness endeared to the liv∣ing;
they ever relieve me; and when I
have wiped my eyes, my heart feels the
energy of fortitude, and I then say, I live
as Heaven chuses."</P>
<P>"If you would live with me," replied
Mrs. Wilson, "I will change my house.
On industry alone depends all my bu∣siness,
and industry will make business
in one street as well as in another. I
have heard some of my neighbours, who
have quitted their first shops to get into
larger ones, complain, that their present
street is not half so <HI>lucky</HI> as their former
one. I have attempted, out of mere be∣nevolence,
and not of mere pride, to play
the philosopher. I have shewn them,
<PB N="119" REF="122"/>
that in their first shops, with much less
business, they were much more industri∣ous;
and that when some people get rich,
it is a chance, that they become again
poor; and really, without suspecting it,
I have pursued a certain notion of Ari∣stotle's,
which I met the other evening,
that there is no good or ill fortune, but
what arises from our own ill or good
conduct; and that to say a man is very
unfortunate, is to say, that he wants ca∣pacity,
or wants industry. However, I
have made no converts of my good neigh∣bours;
and one particularly, who, I fear,
by his expensive mode of living, and by
the affected education of his daughters,
who, when their father's man is weighing
cheese, are employed at delighting his
ears by jarring with a concerto of Haydn,
and who have hung round their shop,
among Cheshire and Wiltshire cheeses,
some select views of ancient Greece, I say
<PB N="120" REF="123"/>
this poor man, who made a respectable
fortune in his first shop by his own in∣dustry,
is now convinced, that Great
Russel-street is one of the unluckiest
streets in town. But I am flying off in
a tangent when I have something to
communicate, of a serious and interesting
nature.</P>
<P>"What I now impart must, my dear
Miss Emily, be confided to your secret ear.
It is not only your delicacy which I fear
to irritate, but the kindness of the hu∣manest
man, which I tremble to offend.
A devoted friendship for two persons,
whose happiness is dear to me as the ex∣istence
of my children, will, if it is re∣turned
but in the smallest portion, re∣ceive
with affection, or pardon with fa∣cility,
what my heart has prompted me
to disclose."</P>
<P>"Why this embarrassment, Mrs. Wil∣son?
What secret can you have to pre∣face
<PB N="121" REF="124"/>
thus solemnly? Can you fear to
unfold, or I to hear, what you say in∣terests
me? The innocent have no se∣crets.
I assure you I never had a secret
in my life. I have indeed been made ac∣quainted
with that kind of intelligence,
but I generally found that a secret was
only malice in disguise. I must freely
say, that extorted silence I can violate
without any conscientious yearnings.
Have you a secret which you would not
tell me as frankly as any other friend?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I cannot agree. Yes, I must
say that innocence may have it's secrets,
which it would expire before it would
reveal. Ah! there are some delicate situ∣ations,
which, if not fearfully and cau∣tiously
concealed, might wear the most
criminal aspect." Mrs. Wilson here gave
a sigh much more profound than au∣dible.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="125"/>
"Well, my dear Mrs. Wilson," re∣plied
Emily, "you must know more of
human nature than myself. I never could
enter into any man's character but my
father's. All men assuredly are not pur∣sued
by the same ill fortune; and all,
therefore, may not be as self-severe. Of∣ten
has he told me, that he never con∣ceived
a thought that he was not prompt
to express. Excellent man! There was
a holiness in his mind. And respecting
those critical situations to which you al∣lude,
where innocence takes a criminal
aspect, he used to say, sincerity is wis∣dom.
What to-day we conceal may ap∣pear
to-morrow; and the explanation we
avoided will then come too late. We
have got into our usual moralizing strain,
my dear Mrs. Wilson; but I am now
quite prepared for your secret."</P>
<P>While Emily was pronouncing her
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
father's apophthegm on sincerity, Mrs.
Wilson reddened, changed her posture,
and drew out her handkerchief to place
before her eyes. Emily was intent on
her netting. The pointed address she had
made, her innocent heart never suspected.
When Mrs. Wilson recovered from cer∣tain
uncomfortable sensations, she pro∣ceeded
thus: "You know, Miss Emily,
that to the singular benevolence of Mr.
Charles Hamilton I and my children are
indebted for our daily bread. We should
now be worse than mendicants; for men∣dicity
has it's friendships; alone in this
metropolis, God denied me one. I con∣sidered
myself as an outcast; no relative
to aid me with an assuasive word of con∣solation;
poverty was combined with
despair. My soul sickened, my existence
was poignant; more than once my armed
hand was raised to my breast; but when
my eye has sought to take a final fare∣well
<PB N="124" REF="127"/>
of my children, the weapon fell, and
the mother lived!" Here Mrs. Wilson
burst into tears, and her thick sobbings
impeded her voice.</P>
<P>"Dear Mrs. Wilson," said Emily in
emotion, "I believe your situation was
as singular as the benevolence of Mr.
Charles. His modesty studiously con∣ceals
his merits; but no man who is uni∣formly
benevolent can so far indulge his
natural dispositions; the voice of grati∣tude
will utter the secrets of modest
philanthropy. He has felt for me here;
I too am his debtor, but it is unknown
to him; he has seen me embarrassed, and
has delicately extricated; he has seen me
insulted, and has silently protected. It
would have been generous to have pro∣tected
a female, but to have done this
unknown to all but to her offender has
in it something of the delicacy of those
sensitive beings who, in an age of roman∣tic
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
generosity, were only alive to the im∣pulse
of heroism."</P>
<P>Mrs. Wilson was now more composed;
and this voluntary applause bestowed on
her friend cheered and animated; a soft
smile brightened her tears, like a sun∣beam
gilding a watery cloud. She said,
"perhaps, Miss Emily, you have ob∣served
Mr. Charles of late. How exa∣nimate,
how pallid, how melancholy!"</P>
<P>"He has told me," said Emily, "he
is unwell."</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied Mrs. Wilson, "he
thinks he never can be well. Sleepless
nights and feverish days, if they can∣not
rapidly annihilate the source of life,
press down it's elasticity, and wear away
slowly but surely it's springs. Never ex∣pect
more to see him other than he is;
his malady is in his silence, and he will
prefer that silence to his health; he pe∣rishes
without the little consolation of
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
saying, I perish; enamoured of his ma∣lady,
he smiles in his sufferings."</P>
<P>"Explain yourself," exclaimed Emily,
earnestly and tremblingly.</P>
<P>"I must first," continued Mrs. Wil∣son,
"assure you, that Mr. Charles some∣times,
in the native simplicity of his heart,
confides circumstances which he would not
expressly mention. If my gratitude had
not taught me to study him minutely, to
catch every variation of his tones, every
expression of his gestures, every distant
combination of a casual word, I had to
this moment, like others, only perceived
that his health decayed, while the cause
would have been mantled over in the
most resolute concealment. Like you,
Miss Emily, in his residence he is unfor∣tunate.
You alike feel the tortures of
a splendid dependence. Similar in your
sentiments, you are similar in your suffer∣ings.
If you mutually look into your
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
own hearts, you will see that of the
other."</P>
<P>A quick blush covered the face of
Emily, warm as the first suffusion of an
early passion.</P>
<P>"And now, Miss Balfour, when I ven∣ture
to say, that with diffidence, but with
ardour, he loves you, must I be censured
for unburthening a truth that has long
oppressed my heart? Who in this world
are dear to me but my children, and
yourself, and Mr. Charles? Rest only
assured, that he knows not of my coming
here, and suspects not that I have disco∣vered
the concealed source of his infeli∣city.
Did I not know him the noblest
of men, I should not have addressed my∣self
now to the most amiable of women.
Gratitude would not have exacted my
disturbance of your repose. Pardon me
then, if I have acted erroneously; it is
the error of respectful affection."</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="131"/>
Emily paused, was distressed, and ra∣veled
her net-work. "I know not how
to reply," she said, "my dear Mrs. Wil∣son.
I have the highest regard for Mr.
Charles. Not to value him would shew
myself worthless. I owe him much. He
is the only friend I have of his sex. But
when I assure you, that I never felt more
than respect for the masculine character,
I speak with my wonted sincerity. The
passion of love has never molested my
quiet; I never could love any man but
my father. I loved him because he was
great and unfortunate. But the friend∣ships
of my own sex form the only so∣cial
pleasures I can receive from another.
There is no delicacy, none of the tender
and melting features of nature in man.
If my father had not been my father, even
him I should have thought severe. As
for myself, I have found some relief; La∣dy
Belfield has given me an invitation to
<PB N="129" REF="132"/>
reside with her during an absence of Miss
Million's from town. Believe me when
I say, that the friendship of her Lady∣ship,
an amiable and accomplished wo∣man,
yields a careless, untempered joy,
a fearless happiness, which the severity
of man can never communicate."</P>
<P>"Name not Lady Belfield!" cried
Mrs. Wilson with energy and emotion.
"I must not further prolong my visit;
but, dear Miss Emily, remember that
Charles Hamilton will be silent but must
love. I conjure you not to notice to
him, that I have mentioned his name to
you on this delicate discovery. Never,
perhaps, would he pardon, and his dis∣pleasure
would render the life I owe him
loathsome."</P>
<P>She quitted the fair Emily, and left
her absorbed in those tender trepida∣tions
of the mind, when with half-reluctant
half-assenting emotions the
earliest flame of passion breaks from
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
the heart, where it lay concealed and un∣felt,
to diffuse itself over the form, to
sparkle in the eye, to bloom in the fea∣ture,
to melodize the voice, and to po∣lish
the air; while nature, seconding the
innocent embarrassment, bewitches the
lover by calling forth those new-born
charms, more fatal to his repose than
those he traced ere his mistress knew her
first amorous thought.</P>
<P>But the severe fortune of Charles
doomed that this first amorous thought
was never known to him, and, instead
of charming, it terrified. The cradle
of Love is wreathed by the Graces, and
the music of Hope pours its fascinating
sound; but to our hero, Love was nursed
by the Furies, and the melodies of Hope
were exchanged for the mysterious re∣proaches
and the averted face of his
Emily.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Punishment continued when the Crime
has ceased.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Wilson had quitted the
faire Emily, and was passing through
the hall, one of the footmen familiarly ad∣dressed
her, and was on the point of forc∣ing
her to an embrace, when violently
bursting from his arms, in an agony of
horror she exclaimed: "And has it come
to this?"—She rushed from the door.</P>
<P>"Body o'me!" cried the footman,
"why the old dame thinks I don't know
her again. She has gone off for all the
world like a modest woman! So the Hol∣born-hill
madam is Miss Emily's good
friend! Birds of a feather, I warrant;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are intelligence for Mrs. Bully!"</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135"/>
Let us follow the miserable and humi∣liated
Wilson! She reached home with∣out
a perception of having issued from the
house of Miss Million. The hall and the
footman were fixed in her imagination;
a repeated gesture seemed as if she was
continually shrinking from his touch;
she writhed in tortures; her face was now
reddened by the deepest shame, and soon
succeeded an ashy horror over every fea∣ture.
As soon as she had reached her
house she hurried to her chamber, threw
herself on the bed, and spoke incohe∣rently
in an agony of spirits: "Father
of Mercies, is mercy alone denied to me?
Is not an error washed away by tears like
mine? No! I had not endured thy final
punishment; I see there was a degree of
misery yet reserved for me, sharper than
the secret sting that lay in my heart.
When I was a prostitute, my shame was
reserved for myself; there was no friend
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
to reproach; no perdition to the cherished
feelings of social affection; no one marked
me; I sinned, no, I only erred, in peace.
Children, children! what have ye not cost
me! what now will ye cost me! Shall I
curse ye? shall I abandon ye? Have ye
not extended your mother on the slowest
rack of agony?—Poor children, ye are
innocent, I alone am guilty. Heaven de∣crees
that the punishment shall endure
when the crime has past. Shall I mur∣mur
to taste the bitterness my own hands
have prepared? Now, wherever I wander,
wherever I fix, 'the finger of scorn' will
point at me, a low, a miserable prostitute!
A fever shakes my frame. Cruel retro∣spection!
I thought myself reinstated in
virtue and comfort—one stroke of acci∣dent
destroys my eternal peace! This
footman—The idea is insupportable!—my shame is promulgated—Miss Emily
must at length know me the wretch I am
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
Wise was her father's counsel, that sin∣cerity
is wisdom; what we conceal to-day
may appear to-morrow. Explanation has
come too late! For the blush it would
have cost me, I now must give the pang
that shall endure with life. She surely
addressed herself to me, to claim the elu∣cidation
of my mysterious history. O tor∣ture!
I will fly into the country; I will
seek some chance servitude; I will perish,
and no one shall know where the wretched
Wilson dies.—This then is the suspended
punishment of heaven! I tasted bitter∣ness;
I feed on gall. My children, my
children, if ye perish, ye cannot reproach
your delirious mother—it is your country,
your God decrees it."</P>
<P>Leaving this victim of her own error
and of public prejudice we return to the
house of Million. As soon as the foot∣man,
who had more than once known her
in her degrading character, entered the
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
servants' hall, he informed the coachman,
that the dame of Holborn-hill had just
passed from the apartment of Emily, and
that she flung out as proud as if she had
been a modest woman. The coachman
related the circumstance to his very good
friend the cook, without "extenuating
or setting down aught in malice." In
these cases the imaginations of men are
not apt to prove so fertile as those of the
women, for reasons known assuredly to
an observer of human nature. The cook
embellished it, the chamber-maid refined
it, while Mrs. Bully gave it the beginning,
the middle, and the end, so severely ex∣acted
by the great Aristotle in the com∣position
of an epic. And here we must
observe, that <HI>lying</HI> is the <HI>eloquence</HI> of the
vulgar. To affect and persuade the hu∣man
passions requires a forcible emotion
of the soul; for a gentle emotion, like the
flat uniformity of a sleeping sea, cannot
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
please long. We must storm the mind.
Poets and orators will therefore best suc∣ceed
in taking possession of the attention
of their readers and auditors, because they
alike are skilful in <HI>amplification,</HI> which, in
truth, is nothing but <HI>lying.</HI> An <HI>exact</HI> re∣presentation
would not affect; we should
not long read a poem, or listen to an ora∣tion,
which had nothing but the simpli∣city
of truth. Of this the vulgar are sen∣sible,
although the cause is concealed.
There are no greater liars than the vulgar,
for experience has taught them the uti∣lity
of lying; they employ augmentatives
or diminutives, as they desire to excite
a correspondent feeling; and the vulgar
are, without knowing it, great poets and
orators.</P>
<P>The cook mentioned, that a vile strum∣pet,
known to John and Miss Emily, had
just gone out; the chamber-maid, that
Miss Emily and John were acquainted
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
with all the strumpets in town; and Mrs.
Bully hurried to Mr. Million, to assure
him, that it was now high time to speak
out; that Miss Emily was only fit com∣pany
for women of the town, and was
concerned with John; that she herself
had seen in her possession an abominable
book, and was besides a professed Arian.</P>
<P>"Well, well, 'tis just what I thought!"
exclaimed Mr. Million. "Taking the
Lord knows who into the house of a bank
director, because she was an old blind
lieutenant's daughter. I shall have all
the daughters of the old knights of Wind∣sor.
Curse her harp, twanging in my ears,
that makes me as melancholy sometimes
as a fall of stocks." He hastened to
Miss Million, who certainly was singularly
shocked with the intelligence, considering
that she already had heard it from Betty
two hours before, and was then quietly
dosing over the last new novel.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141"/>
"My dear father," cried Miss Million,
"I am all of a tremor; my poor nerves!
'tis shameful! not fit to be told! Pray
call in John, accuse him before me, let
me hear all that has past. It will be in
the papers to-morrow; if Mr. Libel should
hear it, Million-house will be scandalized.
A footman!"</P>
<P>John being summoned, related his sim∣ple
story; and reduced the epical lye of
Mrs. Bully to a mere assurance, that
the person who had issued from Miss
Emily's apartment was a common pros∣titute.</P>
<P>Miss Million being now alone, sent in
for Emily, and began thus: "Miss, when
I suffered you to make Portman-square
your asylum, it was from my benevolence."
Emily trembled. "But you have abused
my goodness, and instead of the girl you
was at Exmouth, I find you are the asso∣ciate
of a low prostitute."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142"/>
Emily, pale and alarmed, cried, "Hea∣vens!
what do you mean? Tell me, I be∣seech
you, quickly!"</P>
<P>"Your alarm and your tremor are ex∣tremely
adroit. Performed to admiration!
Why, one would think, to look at you,
you really trembled! But 'tis the pro∣fession
of your friend. One might ima∣gine
that you did not know who was
the person who called on you this morn∣ing."</P>
<P>"Her name is Wilson; she let lodgings
to my father."</P>
<P>"I dare say she lets lodgings. She is
well known in this family; a very <HI>chere
amie</HI> of John's. You will have the kind∣ness
to quit Million-house as early as you
can. I need not recommend you a lodg∣ing."
So saying, she hummed a tender
opera air, and left Emily in the parlour,
motionless and silent.</P>
<P>At length sensation revived to con∣sciousness.
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
She now relieved her op∣pressed
heart in one of those little mo∣nologues
her innocence had rendered ha∣bitual.</P>
<P>"Then are my father's suspicions veri∣fied!
All that he said, how severe! how
true! What confidence can we bestow on
our associates! Friendship, how thy name
is abused! Simplicity, how thy air is mi∣micked!
This wicked woman—Charles
too—They must be united! She is em∣ployed
by him for the purpose of seduc∣ing
me! Every mystery is now revealed.
He was frequently quoting Thomson's
"boundless confidence of soul;"—so too
did the licentious Sedley! She was un∣willing
to part with me at first; she now
offers me a refuge in her house; she would
even change her residence to receive me!
This day she told me that Charles loved
me!—Hypocrite, how have I escaped your
toils? And Charles too, refined dissem∣bler!
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
Does he deceive me, whose image
my fancy cherished next to my father's?
He protected me from Dandelion—I
thought it generous; I find it mean—He would reserve me for his prey! Oh
Emily, poor deserted girl! I feel now as
if the whole earth had conspired against
me. Where shall I fly?"</P>
<P>"To these arms!" exclaimed Vaurien,
as he entered the parlour, throwing him∣self
at her feet. "Your face, Miss Emily,
is covered with tears. Refuse me not the
consolation of uniting mine. Not a tear
on your face but melts on my heart.
Tell me your distresses, accept my little
aid. I have heard some abrupt effusions
of sorrow; I cannot live and forget them."</P>
<P>Emily, confused, hesitating, and deeply
sobbing, had lost her voice. Her fine
auburn tresses fell in disorder on her face
and her neck; she raised two dewy eyes to
heaven; the tears fell, and glittered on her
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
hair; she looked a Magdalen of Guido.
Vaurien, with gentleness placed her in a
chair; he knelt, took her hand, imprinted
a fervid kiss; she had not even the pre∣sence
of mind to resist, or to perceive his
improper attitude. The image of her fa∣ther
was before her; she gazed in a silent
agony of imagination; her tears were re∣newed;
Vaurien was emboldened by her
insensibility.—At this instant Charles
slung open the door—He uttered an au∣dible
ejaculation. Emily started. "Where
am I?" she cried. "Is it you, Sir?"
and she darted a glance of anger and
horror.</P>
<P>"Think 'tis no one!" replied Charles
quickly, and hurried from the room.</P>
<P>"Deceiver!" murmured Emily. She
covered her face with her hands, and sat
absorbed in grief. Vaurien composed his
attitude, and stood near her chair. Such
was the confusion of Emily's mind, that
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
few traces of what had occurred left their
impressions on her recollection. The en∣trance
of Charles had revived her anger
and her fear. When she turned her eyes
on Vaurien, she looked with kindness; she
considered that his presence had proved
her protection.</P>
<P>Vaurien caught the instant change.
"Do me the honour, Miss Balfour, of suf∣fering
my assistance. What occasions this
great distress?"</P>
<P>"You see before you the most mise∣rable
of her sex. A woman without a
friend."</P>
<P>"Say not so, adorable Miss Emily;
whoever knows you must be your friend;
and if a softer name would not offend,
there is who would only live to pre∣serve
it."</P>
<P>"Alas! Sir, you mean not to irritate
a spirit already wounded. I have hung
ever the verge of destruction, blindly,
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
feebly, yet boldly. O were my father liv∣ing!
Angel in heaven! art thou insensible
to the voice of thy daughter? On earth
thou didst open to her the volume of
her fate; and now can thy paternal ten∣derness
not reach thy miserable wan∣derer?"</P>
<P>"Dear Miss Emily, your imagination
is disturbed. Calm the vehemence of feel∣ing;
inform, but do not agitate me."</P>
<P>"Mr. Vaurien, you perhaps can inform
me. You know where I lodged with my
father. The woman says, it is to you and
Mr. Charles she owes her existence."</P>
<P>"Ah! Miss Emily," replied Vaurien,
turning aside his head, "'tis a delicate
subject; let your silence spare my feel∣ings."</P>
<P>"Nay, dear Sir, I must say more, much
more. You must tell me all if you would
be my friend. Miss Million has this mo∣ment
told me, that that woman—"</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148"/>
"Is a low prostitute."—Vaurien spared
her the words.</P>
<P>"And you, Sir, have protected her?"
said Emily, quickly.</P>
<P>"She is the friend of Charles," conti∣nued
Vaurien; "I knew nothing of her.
Common charity makes no distinctions
among it's first claimants; I prefer assist∣ing
the worthless, rather than to chill the
warmth of my heart by enquiries, which
may delay too late the succour due to the
worthy."</P>
<P>"Generous man! And is it then true?
I know nothing of human nature. I
thought her a suffering angel."</P>
<P>"Native goodness! I repeat, she is an
infamous woman. Charles is her friend.
I will never more enter that house: but
surely they have not molested your tran∣quillity?"</P>
<P>"O much, much!" cried Emily. "O
delusion of the heart! Heaven and my
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
father surely protected me. This woman
had such facile tears on her face, such
unobtrusive goodness, such concealed me∣rits.
There is a refinement in depravity.
I thought, till now, that the wicked af∣fected
an ostentatious virtue."</P>
<P>"Trust me!"said Vaurien, "Lady
Belfield has a just esteem for your cha∣racter;
her house is open to you."</P>

<P>VAURIEN, when he met Charles
on his return, rallied him for his
abrupt departure from Emily. "She is
a finished coquette," said he, "when
you are present, but alone she is one of
those dangerous girls, with overflowing
hearts, who are apt to throw us off our
guard. You witnessed her charming dis∣order.
'Twas lucky you entered! A
glance invites her, a word possesses her.
She is now coming to Lady Belfield; a
chaste pair of doves to be yoked to the
car of Venus! Could you imagine that
the female character is so deceptive?
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
But deception is their occupation and their
amusement, their <HI>utile</HI> and their <HI>dulce.</HI>"</P>
<P>Charles listened with horror, and shud∣dered
with reflection. Vaurien dropt se∣veral
obscure hints of former interviews
with Emily, and exhibited such con∣firmed
familiarity, and offered to share
her favours with such friendly confidence,
that Charles, recollecting the visible de∣light
which Emily took in all the con∣versations
of Vaurien, and that disdainful
glance with which she harrowed his soul
when he broke in while Vaurien was at
her feet, blamed his precipitation of pas∣sion
and contracted discernment, con∣cluded
the Gaul to be the favoured lover,
and suspected the purity of Emily.</P>
<P>"Ah! my friend," he cried, "would
I were but banished from this house!
Patiently I cannot suffer one whom I re∣vered
as an angel to become before my
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
eyes an associate for Lady Belfield. To
view her will be hourly to revive regrets,
which, suppressed by absence, may slowly
die away. Existence becomes a torture
in her presence."</P>
<P>"<HI>Tres bien!</HI>" said Vaurien, musing.</P>
<P>In the mean while Lady Belfield had
made exact enquiries relative to Mrs.
Wilson; nor did Johnson, the old friend
of Charles, hesitate to give into her Lady∣ship's
idea of the entire transaction, so
prone are the best men to decide by ap∣pearances.
His Lordship had been al∣ready
prepared to unite with Lady Bel∣field's
measures; and a few days after
the above conversation with Vaurien,
Charles found on his table a note from
her Ladyship, in her own hand-writing,
containing a final dismission. Her Lady∣ship
laid considerable stress on his offen∣sive
and degrading connections.—"Mrs.
Wilson," cried Charles, "will herself
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
vindicate this undeserved obloquy."—At
this moment the following letter was
brought from this unfortunate wo∣man:—</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Scarcely can my scattered thoughts
collect to address you. I have settled
my affairs. The sum you so benevolently
assisted me with will accompany this.
I have taken my departure. I fly I
know not whither.</P>
<P>I forget to acquaint you with the
distressing circumstance that involves my
ruin. The hateful character in which
once I rather erred than sinned, carries
it's punishment when the crime has long
ceased. No human benevolence can
now efface from my heart the indelible
degradation. I have mentioned to you,
that to Miss Emily I revealed all my
history, excepting that humiliating pe∣riod
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
when your hand, prompted alone
by charity, snatched me from so many
nightly horrors. Yes, I concealed this
hideous feature of my life. Could Miss
Emily have embraced a prostitute? And
yet from this small failure of sincerity
I derive this agony of mind, which at∣taches
the misery of turpitude and shame
while I can think.</P>
<P>I waited on her (will you forgive
me?) to reveal your state of mind, which
you do not even suspect I know; but
could I see you perish in silence? Yes,
Sir, the eye of gratitude secretly studied
your every gesture, your every inter∣rupted
idea, your every evanescent aspi∣ration;
gratitude watched and divined
your heart. Emily has traced you in
some concealed offices of kindness; her
voice told her gratitude, her blushes her
love.</P>
<P>* * * * * * * * *</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="155"/>
It is at intervals I write—I was re∣cognized
by a servant—My face glows,
my hand trembles, my tongue is parched,
a fever preys on my vitals. Others will
tell you of my shame. Heaven has set it's
mark on my face, and I wander a female
Cain. A terrible thought flies and returns
to my imagination—Shall a mother be a
murderer? An instant would make my
children angels. Yes, fearlessly could I
raise to the Father of all Mercies an arm
of blood; the blood of my children would
to my God tell not of the cruelty, but
of the chastisement and the contrition of
their mother!</P>
<P>* * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>It was but phrensy! the agony of
thought which o'erleaps all bounds. When
the heart is exhausted, the feelings are
quiet. I have just pressed the dear chil∣dren
to my bosom; heaven surely directed
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
every intendering look, every winding
embrace. The eye of infancy, the kiss
of childhood, can compose the perturbed
heart of maternal despair. How won∣drous
and how secret are the impulses of
nature! In the existence I loath, I feel an
enjoyment in when I seem to live for them.
My heart, worn with age and sorrow, beats
then warm with youth and pleasure.—I fly from London—Ah! should I be
found perishing, think of the survivors!
With their mother's crimes they stand
unconnected; they are the children of
virtuous parents; for I was a virtuous
wife, although a criminal mother. Fare∣well,
generous youth! Ever shall I be as
grateful as I must be miserable,</P>

<P>"Most unfortunate of her sex!" cried
Charles, "her life points a moral. It is
a lesson for the times. A dereliction from
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
chastity is punished with excessive seve∣rity,
and unjust punishments produce real
crimes. Woman must resist the combined
attacks of love; that passion, which our
modes of education and our manners
have taught her to think is the important
occupation of life; but the negligence of
a parent, an accidental occurrence, an
unsuspicious moment, a wandering of
sensibility, a refined intrigue, the certi∣tude
of confidence, and the fondness of
affection, overpower or inveigle that mo∣ral
sentiment, which otherwise would have
persevered in it's habitual duties. Woman
requires, therefore, a more energetic for∣titude
than even man; but fortitude is
masculine; and a female stands unpro∣tected
amidst the illusions of her heart.
But when the hateful life of prostitution
is derived merely from the indigence and
despair of virtue, it is still chastised with
the same torture; the domestic porch of
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
Peace is for ever closed. Such unhappy
wanderers are inured to viciousness by our
barbarous and unrelenting accusations.
A wise and philosophical regulation of the
illustrious Frederick prohibited, under se∣vere
penalties, the aspersion of that female
who had returned to the arms of her
friends, and to the renewal of those do∣mestic
virtues which she had suspended
rather than deserted. How long will phi∣lanthropy
tranquilly gaze on a vast multi∣tude
of females perishing in youth!</P>
<P>"Poor Wilson, thou art no criminal!—and yet thou wert a prostitute. Child
of sensibility! thy heart would burst at
the accusation; thou didst rush in the
darkness of the night to feed thy perishing
children—Thou could'st not have been
a prostitute in the blaze of day! And I,
who would not suffer a widow and her
children to perish in the streets, am now
involved in her apparent criminality.
<PB N="156" REF="159"/>
Johnson censured me for having formed
disgraceful connections; and to her Lady∣ship
I can now no more refer this unhappy
fugitive. He who aids unfortunate vir∣tue
(for this woman is most virtuous) po∣pular

<P>"And Emily then knows my passion;
and has so long deceived Mrs. Wilson?—The flower that is covered with the vir∣gin
dews of innocence can then conceal a
young and foul serpent! Yes, her I have
seen; Vaurien, I have heard; her infu∣riate
glance shivered my frame. Yet can
I never forget her. I loved her when I
thought her virtuous; and I now must
mourn her, as if a sudden death had
deprived me of her whom I loved.
The pleasures of life are not for me;
I will sit by the side of their tomb,
and think of the departed happiness it
holds."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160"/>
He now framed a respectful reply to
Lady Belfield, related the nature of his
connection with Mrs. Wilson, and lament∣ed
that her abrupt flight must render his
conduct mysterious. When he quitted
the house, Vaurien conversed with him
in a tenderness of tone, that seemed as
if he were shedding tears, and he insisted
on his accepting a liberal loan to assist
him in his pursuits.</P>
<P>Old friendships, that have been inter∣rupted
rather through inattention than
pride, are in adversity viewed by an eye
that, clouded with a tear, gives a peculiar
tenderness to the object on which it re∣verts.
Charles flew to Johnson, and
poured in his honest ear the change of
his fortunes. Johnson repeated his old
observation on the danger of bad con∣nections:
"However," he continued,
"trust me, that Lady Belfield has some
concealed reason for this dismission; she
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
cannot conscientiously object to any form
of intrigue. I respect your silence; but
it instructs me. And what now think you
of your friend Vaurien?"</P>
<P>Charles replied, "He is the most en∣gaging
of men, and the most tender of
friends. My honourable connections would
have set me afloat on the wide sea of life
without mast or rudder. The prompt
kindness of Vaurien supplies the ungen∣tleness
of Fortune; he has voluntarily
lent me a considerable sum of money,
which I refused but for his acceptance of
my bond."</P>
<P>"So then," observed Johnson, "after
instilling in you an abhorrence for your
dependance on Lord Belfield, the adroit
Gaul has induced you to depend solely
on his generosity."</P>
<P>Charles with warmth replied: "You
ever condemn in Vaurien those actions
which you would praise in another."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162"/>
"Yes, I have learnt, young friend,
that virtue is not always implied by
actions of virtue. Does that sound para∣doxical?
I must even say, that the cri∣minal
is often virtuous; for as a vicious
character may think proper to perform the
duties of virtue, so may the virtuous cha∣racter
be pressed into the commission of
crimes it abhors, but it cannot shun."</P>
<P>"And there," exclaimed Charles, "you
have described Mrs. Wilson."</P>
<P>Charles now communicated his dispo∣sitions
to adopt some literary avocation;
and soliciting Johnson's opinion, he re∣plied
as follows:</P>
<P>"If you desire to be distinguished as
a genius of the first class, in some ho∣nourable
province of literature, whatever
may be your parts and abilities, you are
too poor, at least by several hundreds
a year. A finished genius, in this age,
is the labour of half a century; a writer
<PB N="160" REF="163"/>
now blooms at forty, and flowers at sixty.
We require, in this age of taste, such
hewings, and such polishings, so much of
the axe, and so much of the file, and so
much fillagree work, that I consider no
writer out of leading strings before thirty,
supposing that then he has been care∣fully
swaddled, nurtured with the most
delicate pap, and eternally humoured in
what relates to place, connections, do∣mestic
habits, coincidences, accidents, and
a crowd of ceteras, which you will find
numbered, one by one, in Helvetius.
I see clearly now, that we shall have no
more any men of genius; for after all
these pains, in which I am sure no mortal
must expect to be successful, the most
inconsiderable accident or omission may
spoil the whole man of genius, as poor
Tristram was ruined by the want only of
a window-pulley.</P>
<P>"Our great authors write little, and
write rarely, and exhibit nothing of ge∣nius
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
but in their compositions. I have
been in company with two of our finest
poets, four of our great historians, a dozen
of our fanciful novelists, and they were as
solemn and as dull as a court of aldermen
when there is no business to transact.
The fire of genius has become quite of a
culinary nature; an immense fire, raised
for the moment, for the preparation of
some delicious repast, but when that is
performed, the saving housewife screws
up the sides, takes out the coals, and
leaves it in an ordinary dimension.</P>
<P>"You may acquire, however, a sub∣sistence
in literature if you are tolerably
ingenious. I confide a secret; the man
you see before you has obtained money
by his literary performances, as if he were
the first genius of the age."</P>
<P>"You surprise. I only knew the name
of one Johnson on the roll of modern
same."</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="165"/>
"It shall not be my fault," replied
Johnson, "if you ever see another. Se∣veral
literary men of the day have sold
their works by a mistake of the public
concerning <HI>names.</HI> But I have some ho∣nesty,
and more delicacy. I am a name∣less
writer, but my productions have
names. My occupation is to adjust, to
arrange, to rescind, and to ramify. Some∣body
brings me a solid glutinous drop,
and my pen becomes diluent. I am fur∣nished
with the raw materials, and then
I weave silk, cotton, or worsted, at the
order of my employer. I lardoon mea∣gerness.
Sir, I am the writer (which you
see is no synonime of author) of a li∣brary.
I have written Travels into Russia,
Tours into Scotland, Embassies to China,
an Earl's Philosophical Essays, a Baronet's
Economical Researches, a Doctor's His∣tory,
and a Counsellor's Reports. I am
the venerable parent of a dozen as chop∣ping
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
literary boys as walk this town. You
know this is an age of authors, and you
perceive one of the reasons. 'Tis just my
employers, whose heads may be as bald as
Caesar's, should wear their laurels or their
literary false hair; for as the epigram says,
'they swear it is their own hair';—and
so it is, for I know where they bought it.
You were surprised the other evening,
that Sir Alexander appeared to forget in
conversation the principles of his own
book; but I assure you, Sir Alexander
never read his own book. The origin of
this occupation (not so singular as it
seems) was owing to this circumstance;
I was a writer in a Review, and whenever
I examined a work, composed by a <HI>gentle∣man,</HI>
I made most alarming strictures on
the necessity of a knowledge of philosophi∣cal
grammar, which no <HI>gentleman</HI> can be
supposed to know, and I recommended an
application to some man of letters, who
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
might be no gentleman, yet a philosophi∣cal
grammarian. No one comprehended
what I meant by the words philosophical
grammar; but they were formidable, con∣fusing,
and alarming. Every month I re∣peated
the urgent necessity of philosophi∣cal
grammar; gentlemen were frightened,
applied to the printer, who gave my ad∣dress,
and since that time I have been a
philosophical grammarian, and having suf∣ficient
employment, not a word now ap∣pears
concerning the necessity of philoso∣phical
grammar."</P>
<P>Charles now placed himself under the
eye of this secret artisan of literary works,
and perceived, that where invention and
imagination are not required, an author
writes on in sunshine and in rain, in gaiety
and in sadness, and with a mechanical pen
forms a mechanical book.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Platonist.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the characters selected by
Vaurien, as persons whose talents
and dispositions seemed adapted to co∣alesce
with his general views, by some
peculiar bias of their own, was an ori∣ginal
enthusiast, who in this history we
shall denominate the Platonist.</P>
<P>He resided in a romantic part of Scot∣land,
and had now arrived in town to
attend the progress of a great work on
polytheism. He accounted it as a fa∣vour
of the gods to have been enabled
to subsist in that cheap country. There
he found a picturesque landscape, sur∣rounding
a cottage retaining an antique
aspect. It was indeed formed from the
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
small remains of an abbey; and what is
supposed to have been a watch-tower,
still stands at the extremity of his gar∣den,
and there he placed his library.
There, abstracted from all things and all
men, he reads Plato and Homer, and
views nothing but the skies.</P>
<P>His cottage is at the entrance of a
deep forest, and the windows command
a view of the high road, a circumstance
that occasions him much anxiety; and
he wishes that the cottage could only
have been viewed by the gods. His life
is solitary, but most poetical; yet we
can hardly deem that a solitude which is
graced by the society of a beauty, ro∣mantic,
sensitive, and happy. He has a
set of very singular companions; a great
variety of animals and birds. His morn∣ings
are consecrated in the watch-tower
to Homer and Plato; the afternoons he
gives to what he calls a conversation with
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
his mute friends; in the evening he wan∣ders
in the forest, explaining Plato to
his lovely companion, and concludes the
night with a hearty supper, and with
the undisturbed rapture that flows from
a heart that beats in unison with his
own.</P>
<P>At school he formed this devotion for
Homer, and a pedant inspired a poet.
It was owing to the accidental literary
bigotry of his master, and his incessant
reverence of that poet, which was not
prompted by the ardour of taste, but
by the frenzy of verbal criticism. The
bust of Homer was placed over his chim∣ney-piece,
the head of Homer was en∣graven
on his seal, and in his hours of
sadness he consoled himself with an Ho∣merical
verse, and in his hours of mer∣riment
he toasted the old Meonian, by
pouring a generous libation to his me∣mory.
The infatuation of the master
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
was communicated to the scholar; but
the impressions were of a more delicate
and sublime nature. In one it was the
impotent extravagance of a frigid verbal∣ist;
but in the other it became a de∣bauchery
of sensibility, breaking from a
most inflammable and abstruse imagina∣tion.
He had unfortunately plunged
deeply into the commentaries of certain
Platonists, who explain Homer into alle∣gories,
discover celestial systems, and con∣vert
the Iliad into a Greek Bible of the
arcana of nature.</P>
<P>When he quitted the school, his mind
was deeply tinctured by all the colori∣fications
of the Platonic prism. He
mused on the bewitching notion of uni∣versal
beauty, which pervades that enthu∣siastic
philosophy; but when at length
he obtained a complete copy of Plato's
works, the intellectual malady diffused
itself in every nerve of his mind; and
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
such was the conflict of his animal spi∣rits,
that he could never read Plato with∣out
violent palpitations of the heart, and
more than once such has been the agony
of his sensibility, that he fainted over the
volume as he held it with a kind of religi∣ous
tremor. These indeed are the peculiar
features of enthusiasm, that abstraction of
the imagination which roves amidst un∣known
scenes, and gazes on poetical chi∣meras.
It is felt by poets in the fury of
their orgasm, by philosophers in the ideal
fabrication of their systems, and by mys∣tics
in their attempts to abstract them∣selves
from earth to heaven.</P>
<P>When we read the discoveries of ano∣ther,
we acquire a spirit of discovery.
The imitative genius of man becomes
every thing to which it is accustomed.
He read of a thousand fine meanings in
Plato and Homer, which he could never
have imagined, but having once ima∣gined
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
them, he added a thousand more of
his own. A mind like his only requires
the scattering of a small handful of seed to
cover it's extensive and fertile soil with a
vast efflorescence; and like that happy
climate that feels not the rigour of a
changing season, his mind was a year of
one continued summer. Every day brought
it's new discovery, and every day was a
day of triumph.</P>
<P>Like other inspired persons (for he
considered his delight as inspiration) he
now conceived it a duty to enlighten a
dark and erring world. "All Europe,"
he cried "is surrounded by a dismal
night; hence men are continually mo∣lesting
each other, and one man only im∣pedes
another while he himself is im∣peded."
He observed old religions de∣caying,
while modern sects were filthily
spawned forth, and lamely crawled from
each antiquated and expiring monster.
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
He first communicated his notions to a
private circle; some considered them as
the curiosities of a student of great learn∣ing,
some as the philosophical amusements
and paradoxical vanities of a man of ge∣nius,
but few discerned that they were
the delusions of a literary lunacy. Their
doubts soon ceased, when, to the astonish∣ment
even of the learned world in this
close of the eighteenth century, were
published two quarto volumes, in which
he avowed himself a Platonist in it's
most religious sense, and in which he af∣fected
to prove, that the Christian reli∣gion
was merely a bastardized and bar∣barized
Platonism. The divinities of
Plato were the divinities to be adored;
and he affirmed, that no people could be
virtuous and happy if they were not
taught to call God, Jupiter; the Virgin,
Venus; and Christ, Cupid.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="175"/>
It was now in vain to dissemble. His
friends attempted to reason; but logic
reforms no enthusiast. An enthusiast
cannot fail to gain his cause, because he
alone can be his own judge. In vain the
world opposed, and worse than opposed,
neglected. He was an Atals for himself;
the solitary supporter of a system even
too unreasonable to be adopted by phi∣losophical
reasoners, and even too delu∣sive
to delight philosophical fanciers.
He knew, he said, he was the Gemis∣tus
Pletho of the age, and he was con∣tent.
To the opposing world he there∣fore
opposed Plato and Homer; and he
looked not in this barbarous age to be re∣warded
with a garland in the school of
philosophy.</P>
<P>He saw himself deserted, but forgave
the unkindness of men, because he found
himself consoled, and indeed fully occu∣pied,
<PB N="173" REF="176"/>
by the humanity which he had dis∣covered
in other animals. Even this was
mysterious, for he darkly hinted that he
was not a little versed in the language of
beasts. He lodged in his house a most
numerous society; on the stairs, in his
study, from the garrets to the cellars, and
even to the very roofs, were assembled a
numerous retinue of the mute citizens of
the world, and he was observed to pass
entire days in a very large aviary of
birds.</P>
<P>The Platonic system had obtained him
some admirers among the fair sex. It
was not ill adapted to their capacity;
for being incomprehensible, it's mysteri∣ousness
irritated female curiosity, and it
was at least more sublime than disclosing
an enigma, or unfolding a charade. It
was pregnant with the dissolving ener∣gies
of a delicious sentiment; for what
the Platonist terms "the science of uni∣versals,"
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
is made to consist in "UNI∣VERSAL
BEAUTY." It was a homage
to the sex. He used sometimes to break
out in expressions like these: "Beauty
walks silently on the extremities of it's
feet, alluring, ravishing, and raising all
things by it's power; it swims above the
light of forms; it covers the occult union
of the gods!" The entire system was
elegant and brilliant; it exhibited only
forms of symmetry and grace; and the
female attention, that was once allured
by the ideal perfection of an eternal
beauty (the image existing in the mind
of the divine architect) and became ini∣tiated
into the Platonic doctrine of ideas,
was soon entangled in a tissued net of
silk and silver, that adorned rather than
perplexed the lovely captive. Where
she sought a master, she found a lover;
and, entranced, listened to the eloquence
of diction, the dazzling of metaphors,
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
the inexhaustible poetry, and the infec∣tious
enthusiasm of a man who came
recommended by many accomplishments
of personal figure, and by many grace∣ful
acquirements. The Platonist is a
masterly musician, a sublime poet, and,
when warmed, his voice is melodious,
his eye is illuminated by quick intel∣ligence,
his face takes all the changes of
his soul, every gesture is adapted to every
sentiment, and, like the Cumean Sybil,
he looks the image of inspiration. His
usual style on these subjects shews all
the art of poetry without it's labour;
he pours forth an opulence of diction,
and his copious periods roll with mag∣nificence,
as if he were reading an Eng∣lish
imitation of Cicero's manner; with
felicitous expression he intenders by pa∣thetic
sentiment, and charms by the
gaiety of exuberant imagery. Even his
mystic unintelligibility becomes a grace;
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
it serves as a resting-place to repose the
mind that has followed him in his ele∣vations;
and they who are not void of
imagination lament when the Platonist
closes his voluble and enchanting elo∣cution.</P>
<P>He had long sighed to unite himself
to a beautiful female, on whose bosom
he might meditate in rapture and re∣verie.
Solitude, deprived of such a com∣panion,
presented nothing to his sensi∣tive
soul but a desolation of the pas∣sions.
The beasts and birds, with all his
vaunted knowledge of their language, he
confessed were not equivalent to the ab∣sence
of this inestimable associate. Among
men he could find no companions; for
such was the extreme irritation of his
sensations, that his mind had refined it∣self
to a feminine delicacy; it was ap∣palled
by serious expostulation, and
shrunk in horror from coarse merriment.
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
In explaining the principle of beauty he
found consolers and admirers among the
women; but he discovered no female
whom he could select from all the world;
for to a congenial disposition and a singu∣lar
beauty of person he required what is
still more rare, an intimate knowledge of
Greek.</P>
<P>Except a total ignorance of Greek,
Charlotte Fenton was the nymph of his
soul. Nature had cast them in the same
mould; but a diversity of education had
provided different materials to store their
imagination. From childhood she had
lived in a rural solitude, studious of works
of the most extravagant fancy; and all
the day and part of the night were con∣sumed
in a little circle of magic, from
which she never issued. She walked
fearless on the utmost verge of romantic
fiction. With all works of reasoning she
<PB N="178" REF="181"/>
was disgusted; her logic consisted in sen∣timent,
and from the impoverished nar∣ratives
of history, where all men to her
eye seemed dwarfs, she roved to the gi∣gantic
heaven of Homer, who, though
somewhat disguised in the versions of
Pope, were to her still heroes. She read
with avidity the ancient romances of
"Amadis de Gaul," and feasted on the
six folios of "Perce Forest;" the Ara∣bian
Tales were not disapproved; and
Spenser was the most modern poet she
read; but when our Platonist opened
the vast scene of his philosophical fancy,
her curiosity flew with a hundred wings;
she gazed in mute astonishment, and sat
hours in silent meditation.</P>
<P>But the divine Greek was the only
language by which he could communi∣cate
his sensations. She entreated his
instruction, and they had scarcely ad∣vanced
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
to the third book of the Iliad,
when the delighted Platonist thus pro∣posed
a new system of life:—</P>
<P>"The ancient philosophers," he said,
"when they felt the impulse of divine
energies, quitted the tumultuous habi∣tations
of men. We must frustrate the
magic of Circe, and bid adieu to the
detaining arms of Calypso. For many
years must we be exercised in the ca∣thartic
virtues, for the purpose of se∣parating
as much as possible the soul
from the dark folds of the body, and
then at length, when we have destroyed
the tyranny of the passions, those baneful
suitors which had so basely revelled in the
palace of the soul, we shall enjoy the de∣lightful
beams of science and wisdom,
till becoming established, like Ulysses, in
our paternal port, like him we shall be
united with our father, from whose em∣braces
we have been so long unhappily
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
torn away. We shall find the lyre of
true philosophy on the banks of Lethe;
there let us pass away our lives in blissful
contemplations, and in listening to di∣vine
harmony, secluded from the base
multitude of mankind."</P>
<P>"And this, my lovely Charlotte, has
been the only resource of the enlightened
and pious ancients. Either we must tra∣vel
or retreat; for the delusions of mo∣dern
religions are an impiety to the gods.
Pythagoras and Plato, the interpreters of
nature, considered it as necessary, for the
acquirement of knowledge, to traverse
many seas, and inhabit many countries;
but for travelling we have no money.
Euripides composed his tragedies in a
cave, Democritus his philosophy in a se∣questered
spot, Demosthenes became an
orator by the shores of the sea, and
Numa consulted the nymph Egeria in
silence and in solitude. Even the imi∣tators
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
of these great men, Moses, Jesus,
and Mahomet, alike retired at stated
intervals to arrange their systems, athe∣istical
as they are! The presence of the
gods is only visible in solitude. Archi∣medes
heard not the falling walls of his
city; Carneades, at his meals, forgot to
eat, so that he had nearly been famished
in his own house; and what think you of
that philosopher who deprived himself of
his sight, that he might not be disturbed
in his sublime contemplations by inter∣vening
objects; and that other, who, lest
he might be tempted to issue from his
studious retreat, shaved half of his head,
that it might hinder him from appearing
in the world; for in that Platonic age no
wigs were worn.</P>
<P>"I languish for retirement, that I may
compose a life of Homer, of whom no∣thing
is known, and finish my Platonic
commentary on our divine poet. I have
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
calculated the verses, arranged the mate∣rials,
and the daily labour of three years
will establish a system which shall endure
with the elements it describes. Does
Venus inspire my Charlotte to relinquish
the atheists of an unplatonic world, and
to soar to the mysteries of the divine
geometrician?"</P>
<P>Such was the conversation of the Pla∣tonist,
who discovered that Venus had
inspired. They sought the romantic spot
we have described, and the time now
arrived, when they were sent back to the
world, enriched by the life of Homer,
and the copious discoveries of our Pla∣tonist,
to renovate the age of Astraea, when
polytheism was to form an universal re∣ligion.</P>

<P>HOWEVER visionary to some may
appear the reveries of the Platonist,
so unsettled are the opinions of most phi∣losophical
men on the interesting topic of
religion, for every popular creed has been
examined with severity or ridicule, that,
sensible of the beneficial influence of some
prevalent system, they have long sought,
and are still seeking, for some new reli∣gion,
which, founded on the invariable
principles of nature, shall offer to all peo∣ple

<P>Polytheism, as explained by the re∣searches
of the learned, and by the fancies
of the visionary, is allegorised till it becomes
a system of natural philosophy. The gods
are but the elements, and they therefore still
exist visible and palpable. Campanella was
of opinion, that the world and the elements
had sensation, because that which is com∣posed
of them has sensation, and nothing can
be in the effect which is not in the cause<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bayle, article Campanella.</NOTE>.
It is also <HI>now</HI> considered by some, that a
revival of the notion of the demi-gods or
hero-worship, would serve as a noble en∣gine

passionate devotion of elevated minds.

The erection of a PANTHEON<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The following extracts from the Monthly Re∣views, on this novel extravagance of Platonism, I transcribe, being doubtful whether, otherwise, the greater part of what is here written on the subject will not appear incredible.—"There are some who aim to place the heathenism of Greece, as interpreted by the Platonists, among the religions publicly taught in temples, and professed in society. We fear it is not to be ranked among the harmless dreams of lite∣rary caprice. We have heard reports of some per∣sons being willing to incur expence for opening a pantheon, in honour of the benefactors and instruc∣tors of society." M. R. vol. xvii. 149. new series.—"This is the right age for making such Platonical impressions. There is a debility of intellect, which succeeds to excessive inquiry, whose morbid craving the Platonic opinions are admirably calculated to gratify. After the age of reason was past, they found savour with the mind-sick inhabitants of Athens and Alexandria, of Rome and Constantinople, and are <HI>likely</HI> once more to accompany the progress of European declension." vol. xiv. 248.—"In modern Italy, many persons have given into these chimae∣ras, and the theurgists have been excited the jea∣lousy of ecclesiastical authority." vol. xvii. 154.</NOTE> in this
metropolis is, in some circles, a favourite
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
object. The Platonist terms this edifice
"a place for commemorating the ascent
of excellent daemons." To worship such
men would be only adoring some parti∣cular
virtue, and perpetuating by our
piety the virtue we adore. Every human
virtue forms an attribute of the divinity,
and the Creator would be reverenced,
while we felt and confessed his attribute
in his creature.</P>
<P>The age seems propitious to every spe∣cies
of fanaticism. Scepticism spreads ra∣pidly,
and superstition gathers new energy
to oppose scepticism. Established opinions
are too moderate for either; hence religion
breaks into sectarism, and philosophy di∣vides
into systems. Extravagance wrestles
with extravagance; the imagination wan∣ders
astonished and half-delighted, but
calm sense looks around, and retires in
horror. Religion and philosophy have
become two gladiators; one departs not
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
without destroying the other; yet who
shall be certain that one alone will tri∣umph?
Two gladiators have sometimes
perished together by their mutual aim.</P>
<P>One of the favourite projects of Vau∣rien
was an antichristian hope to over∣throw
the religion of Jesus. He therefore
associated with all those, whose talents or
power would co-operate with this inten∣tion.
He desired to overturn Christia∣nity,
not because it was a system of re∣ligion,
but a system of opulence; he was
no enemy to the New Testament, but to
the bench of Bishops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vaurien had also another reason for his hatred of Christianity; it's principles were too peaceful, too self-mortifying, and too enervating. But the present times are as sanguinary as those of any for∣mer period; and we do not see why some should so much dislike Christianity for these causes, since <HI>Christians</HI> are now as ferocious <HI>cut-throats</HI> as those of ancient times. Be it as it may, Vaurien's idea of Christianity appears in the following <HI>pensée</HI> of Beaumelle, p. 177: "Paganism, accustoming men to ferocity by sanguinary sacrifices, in deifying great generals and courageous citizens, their wise legislators inspired a love of liberty. Christianity, in only shew∣ing sacrifices without blood, in putting softness in the human character, canonising obscure persons detached from worldly interests, gives them a spirit of obedience. Christianity talks too much of heaven, to induce much attachment to the objects of the earth, and by inculcating submission to monar∣chy, is an enemy to all reasoning."</NOTE>. He had formed
a strict intimacy with the Platonist, and

in the promulgation of polytheistical pub∣lications,</P>
<P>When he arrived at his house, the love∣ly
Charlotte informed him, that the Pla∣tonist
was then occupied at his prayers,
in chaunting a noon-day hymn to Apollo.
"You then," said Vaurien, "do not unite
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
in his prayers?" Charlotte replied, "I
hold Apollo in no esteem, because of his
ill usage of Daphne. We women are wil∣ling
to be won, but not to be forced.
It is cruel to persecute what we cannot
subdue. Venus is my protector."—Vau∣rien
looked languishingly on Charlotte,
and exclaimed, "Venus likewise is the
goddess of young men; I worshipped her
in the remains of her temple in Greece."
"Good Gods!" cried the romantic Char∣lotte,
"thou then art my amiable bro∣ther;
the first I have met who has paid
due reverence to my divinity. The Pla∣tonist
is mindless of her daily orisons.
Were we but in her temple to perform
her rites, as Herodotus describes!"—"All
heaven, all earth, is her temple!" ex∣claimed
Vaurien; "and sure the blushes
that breathe like roses on that cheek, the
liquid brilliancy of those eyes, the soft
heavings of that bosom, proclaim the
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
presence of the divinity."—"Ah!" said
Charlotte, "you are the first man who
ever joined me in a votive testimony to
Venus."</P>
<P>By this time the Platonist had con∣cluded
his long hymn to Apollo. Vau∣rien
now ascended with difficulty. At the
bottom of the stairs was a large kennel
of dogs of various nations, who lived in
a good understanding with each other,
excepting when a bone was thrown among
them, for then the dogs behaved like men,
that is, they mangled and tore each other
to pieces with sagacity and without re∣morse.
Monkeys and apes were chained
on the banisters. A little republic of cats
was peaceably established on the first land∣ing
place. He passed through one room
which was an aviary, and another which
was an apiary.</P>
<P>From the cieling of the study of the
Platonist depended a polished globe of
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
plated glass, which strongly reflected the
beams of the sun. Amidst this aching
splendor sat the Platonist, changing his
seat with the motions of his god, so that
in the course of the day he and the sun
went regularly round the apartment. He
was occupied in constructing a magic
lanthorn, which puerile amusement ex∣cited
the surprise of Vaurien.</P>
<P>The Platonist accounted for it. "My
dissertation on the Eleusinian mysteries is
not all understood. The whole machinery,
reflected on a white sheet, will be more
intelligible than any I could give on a
sheet of paper. In the presence of the
gods, in the most holy of the mysteries,
daemons appeared with the heads of dogs;
Pletho says this, who lived a thousand
years after the mysteries. Then I have
'omniform and terrific monsters;' then
the demiurgus, the progress of purgation,
inspection, crowning, torch-bearing, and,
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>
finally, friendship with the gods. But
here is the great difficulty. How shall I
represent 'the intolerable effulgence of the
divine light?' Much it grieves me, that
for this sublime purpose a candle and a
piece of coloured tin are all I can get into
the lanthorn. The gods are not always fa∣vourable
to my attempts. After long expe∣riments,
I conceived I had discovered the
perpetual sepulchral lamp of the ancients.
Last week I invited my friends to a phi∣losophical
lecture on my perpetual lamp;
I triumphed in my discovery; but ere
my lecture closed my lamp was suddenly
extinguished. Good Gods!"</P>
<P>Vaurien condoling with him on the
imperfection of all human representations
of the divinity, and the extinction of a
perpetual lamp, enquired the reason for
his singular attachment to the mute crea∣tion?
Here the Platonist assumed a dig∣nified
air, threw himself back in his chair,
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
to receive the full beams of the sun, then
musing, raised his kindled eyes on Vau∣rien,
and addressed him:—"To you,
whom I respect as the great reformer of
the age, who feel a piety for the gods,
and aid their solitary adorer, I will un∣fold
the inspirations of wisdom."</P>
<P>"Know then, that all men are brutes,
and all brutes are men. At first their figu∣ration
appears materially different, but
it is not so in reality. Many brutes ap∣proach
closely to the human form; and
among men, many approach closely to
the brutal form. We have monkey
faces, bull heads, asinine countenances,
spider legs, and porpoise obesity; and
among females we have the face of a
tygress, cat-like claws, owl-like screech∣ings,
and serpentine involutions. That
they are not more minutely exact, has
absolutely arisen from the chance or∣ganization
<PB N="194" REF="197"/>
of nature; but their passions,
their gestures, and their propensities are
the same.</P>
<P>"You will object, that the brute crea∣tion
has not made an equal progress in
art and science with the human species:
but this I deny; the brute creation are
wiser than we; they only cultivate those
science which are of real utility to them:
take for instance the ape, he is a perfect
similitude of man; the paws of an ape
are much like our own; why then, you
would say, have apes not made an equal
progress with man? Because (and I speak
from having lived among apes more than
twenty years) apes are not so susceptible of
listlessness or ennui as ourselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Les singes ne sont pas susceptibles de L'ENNUI, qu'ôn doit regarder aninsi que je le prouverai dans le troisieme discours, comme un des principes de la perfectibilité de l'esprit humain.—Helvetius L'Esprit, vol. I. IV.—Gentile reader, we do beseech thee to observe, that "the perfectibility of the hu∣man mind," this fashionable phrase of our <HI>London</HI> philosophers, is merely an obsolete fancy imported from France.</NOTE>; an ape
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
is never idle and always happy. And
justly has Helvetius observed on this
very topic, that it is to this desire of ac∣tivity
we owe all the great actions of great
men. Most men are despicable animals
when by themselves; a brute never. All
generals, all poets, all historians, have be∣come
so through rank idleness; a listless
existence tortures; so, having nothing
better to do, the general sacks or mas∣sacres
a town, the poet writes his com∣memorating
ode, and the historian shall a
thousand years afterwards write you every
particular, and very often in the present
tense!</P>
<P>"And this I affirm, that in those arts
and sciences which are of real utility to
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
animals and birds, they excel all man∣kind.
Can the weaver's loom spread the
fineness of the spider's web? Can the
architect build like the beaver? Sails
the mariner like the nautilus? And in
domestic life, can we skin fish like the
cat? Clamber like the monkey? and
scent like the dog? Ask the Swiss pea∣sant,
Who climbs and hangs securer on
the sharp points of precipices, himself or
his chamois? They have, therefore, in
far greater perfection than ourselves, that
peculiar art or science they desire. To
excel in any, we advise a man of genius
to apply only to a single pursuit. 'Tis
precisely what does every brute, and
therefore I aver, that every brute is a
man of genius."</P>
<P>Here the Platonist paused, and desired
to exchange seats with Vaurien, as the
sun had got round to him; then, with
a collected air, he resumed his discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="200"/>
"To you, the confident of my heart,
I reveal it's wondrous secret. Know then,
I have obtained the various languages of
brutes, with whom I converse by the
hour. I can convert my person into all
forms, my voice into all intonations."</P>
<P>"Their language is precisely the same
which men would employ in a similar
predicament. Imagine to yourself a
company of dumb men; how would
they converse? evidently by gestures.
Such is the language of animals. Ges∣ture
is a vocal silence, an incorporated
voice. They too have their tones, but
their gestures are exercised with incon∣ceivable
perfection; and by these they
preserve a communication with their bro∣ther
brutes; I mean men. They have
few ideas, but many sentiments; are not
logicians, but passionate beings; they feel
exquisitely, and yet they express all they
feel.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201"/>
"The emotions of GESTURE constitute
a language far superior to that of
vocal enunciation. It is the spontaneous
and universal language of nature. Our
method of communicating our ideas is
tedious, imperfect, and deceptive. By
gesture alone we can discover the invo∣luntary
feelings of the heart. Say, do
not the quick and flashing eye; the
cheek, whose tints are fugitive; the half∣averted
mien; the frown, that breaks,
that passes, but is not forgotten; the
look that refuses while the hand presents,
exhibit the personal dispositions? The
perturbed eye, the walk now quick now
slow of Cataline, shewed in his distracted
form the soul of conspiracy. The unal∣tered
mien, the changeless peace of every
motion of Socrates, who, at home or
abroad, Xantippe confessed, never shewed
one ruffled feature; did these not testify
the regular current of his constant mind?
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
And the wretch with pliant features,
whom Titus observed to turn aside the
half-stifled laugh at the misfortunes of
innocence, while he gave abundantly
causeless sighs and tears, these indicated
to Titus the concealed villain. In that
young man, said Sylla, speaking of Cae∣sar,
who walks so unmannerly along the
streets, I see several Mariuses. Cicero
relates of Anthony, that he frequently
struck the ground with his knees, by the
vehemence with which he pleaded. Yes,
my friend, as the bent bow is compressed
with a double force, the arrow is more
impetuously darted; 'tis an arrow driven
by the storm of heaven, that pierces where
it touches. Who knew better of nature
than Cicero, when he advised his brother,
that to be affable in his government, he
must do something more than invite to
feasts. <HI>Nil interest habere otium apertum,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
<HI>vultum clausum</HI>; little it signifies to set
your doors open if your face is closed. We
Platonists have long known that gesture
is the only language of the passions; and
that brutes possessing this in greater per∣fection
than men, employ a purer and
more energetic language.</P>
<P>"And indeed the great Campanella
affirmed, that beasts spoke to each other,
because they certainly understand each
other; for which simple observation the
Inquisition singed his beard and threat∣ened
to burn his body. Such was his di∣vine
knowledge of gesture, that during
his imprisonment of many years, he tells
us, that he knew all the sentiments of
his absent friends or enemies by mimick∣ing
all their gestures, and taking all their
postures. Some have had the temerity
to affirm, that he was a melancholy hypo∣chondriac:
but Burke tells you he has
<PB N="201" REF="204"/>
tried the experiment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I have often observed, that in mimicking the looks and gestures of angry or placid, or frighted, or daring men, I have involuntarily found my mind turned to that passion whose appearance I endeavoured to imitate. Our minds and bo∣dies are so closely and intimately connected, that one is incapable of pain or pleasure without the other." Burke on the Sublime and Beautiful, p. 250.</NOTE>, and Lavater cites
it as an indubitable fact; and are Burke
and Lavater lunatics?</P>
<P>"And therefore on this curious topic,
how admirable is an observation of Rous∣seau,
who seems to me to have been a
true Platonist. "In neglecting," says he,
"the language of signs, which speak to
the imagination, we have lost the most
energetic of languages. The impression
of words is always feeble, and we speak
to the heart much more forcibly by the
eye than by the ear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Emile, lib. IV. p. 179.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="205"/>
"I am charmed," said Vaurien, "by
this account of the language of beasts;
and assuredly you have made many cu∣rious
observations on their national cha∣racter
and domestic manners."</P>
<P>"I have indeed long been a citizen of
the vast republic of brutes, and they have
consoled me for the ingratitude of my own
species. How I lose my patience, when
I hear your great philosopher acknow∣ledge
the feelings of brutes to be more
exquisite than those of men; and then
pronounce, that their principle of mo∣tion,
though it seems determined by mo∣tives,
is merely mechanical, and depends
absolutely on their organization<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon's Natural History, vol. III. p. 224. Smellie's translation.</NOTE>: but
Buffon, I am told, only <HI>wrote</HI> on animals,
which is quite a different thing from con∣versing
with them. His sublime narra∣tive
of the camel's journey through the
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
desarts, is unrivalled by modern elo∣quence;
but he himself never travelled
through a desart, and he is therefore a
greater poet than a natural historian.</P>
<P>"Ah, my friend, how enchanting is the
simplicity of the domestic habits of brutes!
When I become a match-maker between
a dog and his female, how I envy the
short term of their courtship! He is no
coxcomb, and she is no coquette. He
lingers not with cold compliments on the
beauty of her colours, her birth, or her
age. He feels but one desire; the multi∣plication
of his species. But then what
sincerity in every gesture, what vivacity
in his eyes, and with what tenderness his
tongue caresses his beloved. Men are such
eternal bablers in love or in rage; but an
animal simply evinces his passion by a
single act. Is he revengeful? he honestly
bites. Is he affectionate? he fervently
licks. He is never an assassin, or an adu∣lator.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207"/>
"How have I admired the cool saga∣city
and magisterial air of a venerable
furred long-whiskered Tom, sitting state∣ly,
stretched voluptuously, or quietly
dosing by my winter fire. Sometimes he
goes a hunting, for a little recreation;
but his velvet sides are stuffed with that
equability of humour, which shews, that
his existence is his enjoyment. Nothing
but a female cat can discompose his se∣rene
philosophy.</P>
<P>"Mules, because they will not submit
to be tutored by us, who are not equal to
them in point of their ability, after hav∣ing
carried the traveller on the slippery
edge of precipices, picking their way, step
by step, and stopping when near danger,
when they arrive at home are beat and
abused for, their stubborness. What wis∣dom
in the mules! what idiocy in the
men! Some mules, having been chased
from a paddock, never offered to return;
yet it was perceived that the grass had
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
been eaten. They watched, and observed,
every night, that they leapt over the
fences, and, after their stolen feast, re∣turned
to their adjoining field before the
morning. Erasmus tells us, he saw a dog
that had been taught to convey meat, in
a basket, from the shambles: attacked by
other dogs, he would defend his master's
property; but when he saw his assailants
too numerous, he would then snatch a
piece of the meat, lest he should get no∣thing
but blows and honour in the ruin∣ous
war.</P>
<P>"Does not history present us with more
numerous instances of the fidelity of dogs
than of men? Like men of strong sen∣sations,
their resentment is proportioned to
their gratitude. When I was at Mount-Edgecumbe
I saw a monument, on which
I gazed with awe: it is raised to the
memory of a huntsman, who neglecting to
feed his dogs for three days, as soon as he
entered was torn to pieces; a dreadful
<PB N="206" REF="209"/>
howling spread through the whole society;
and feeling more sensibly the passion of
vengeance than that of hunger, they long
left their victuals untouched. When a
dog-butcher at Canton enters a street, all
the dogs pursue him in full cry. When a
Kamtscadale loses his stick, by which he
drives the dogs of his sledge, they in∣stantly
perceive it, and run off as fast as
possible, to overturn him in the snow.
Ill treat a dog, he will long remember it;
and, when you seek his reconciliation, will
preserve his dignity, and make no ad∣vances
while he knows the hand that now
caresses once struck. And shall we now
say with Buffon, that these are only pieces
of mechanism, who merely derive their
motion from their organization? I con∣fess
it requires a patience, which looks
like sublimity, to acquire a knowledge of
their habits and language. Swammerdam
passed ten long years, extended on his
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
belly, to characterise the national genius
of ants. Reaumur must have devoted as
many, to discover the various nidifications
of birds; and he indeed cleanly traced the
manner in which they digested their food.
I myself have patiently watched, through
forty days and forty nights, the nuptials
of a frog.</P>
<P>"To touch but rapidly (for I see the
sun is declining) on birds. Thomson has
described 'The Passion of the Groves'
in mellifluous numbers, worthy of Plato,
and with a knowledge of their language
as marvellous as his numbers.</P>
<P>"The language of birds is elliptical,
resembling the periods of Tacitus; little
said, much understood. Every species
has a different intonation, as every native
of a large kingdom has his provincial dia∣lect.
The voice of the raven is solemn;
of the dove mournful; of the rook gay,
but aukward; while the merry wood∣pecker
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
loudly laughs; and the fern-owl
serenades his mate at the moonlight oak.</P>
<P>"I could give you instances of a sub∣lime
maternal affection, a rapid yet in∣tricate
invention, a vigilant artifice in
concealing some cherished abode, heroic
acts of sexual attachment, and a spirit of
sociality, that, if interrupted, has an in∣fluence
on the health, the passions, and
the enjoyments of the friendly brute.</P>
<P>"Delicate birds have their vanities as
well as delicate people. A goldfinch be∣fore
a mirror is a perfect coquette; she
smooths her plumes as she sits on her
perch, and gazes with delight; and if she
is provided with a little bucket and chain,
she will draw it up, and then look around
that her ingenuity may not pass unob∣served.
Delicate birds have also an ex∣quisite
delicacy of passion. The wild ca∣nary
sooths with his song the dear con∣nubial
nest. In the annals of my aviary
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
shall it be recorded, that one, as he was
singing, suddenly dropt. The unfinished
song alarmed the female; she slew from
her breeding nest, and sought her silent
consort. She pecked at her friend; he
was no more! She stood beside him, re∣fused
nourishment, and gazed in silence
till she died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious fact is noticed by Kaimes, and is by no means improbable. These exquisitely sensi∣ble birds appear to die frequently of sudden frights. Of three canaries, I have known two found dead in their cage, although apparently left well.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>"Such are the domestic manners, and
such the various conversations of these ci∣tizens
of the world! Join to this the Py∣thagorean
system of Metempsichosis, esta∣blished
among the wise ancients, and then
judge of the awe and veneration I feel
for this neglected portion of our fellows.
Much it afflicts me, when I hear the
experimental philosophers consider them∣selves
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
scientific, when their ingenuity has
invented the most exquisite tortures. Here
one famishes a vulture, to see how long it
can exist without food; a locust has it's
intestines pulled out and filled with cot∣ton,
then transfixed with a pin, remains
five months moving it's legs and it's an∣tennae,
to the great satisfaction of the phi∣losopher;
canine mothers, big with their
infants, are anatomised alive, to rip out
the young, who are born like so many
Macduffs; aqua-fortis is dropt on a living
animal, to trace the entire progress of
singeing, blackening, and burning the liv∣ing
flesh; and two sparrows are starved
to death, to verify whether bruised seed,
or minced meat, is best adapted to re∣cover
their almost extinct life. Good
Gods!"</P>
<P>Vaurien having felicitated the Platonist
on the new world he had opened to
himself, said, "propose to overturn
<PB N="211" REF="214"/>
Christianity by the publications of the
Platonists, and to erect a Pantheon, that
the Gods may be honourably reverenced."</P>
<P>"That is my important pursuit; I have
already prepared the soaring and ecstatic
Olympiodorus, the noble and obscure
Heraclius; I join the Asiatic luxuriancy
of Proclus, divinely explained by Jam∣blichus,
and profoundly delivered by Plo∣tinus.
Plotinus, who was surnamed 'In∣tellect'
by his contemporaries, such was
the fervour of his mind, that he was ac∣customed
to write without attending to
the orthography or the revision of his
works, which perhaps occasions their di∣vine
unintelligibility; for the celestial vi∣gour
rendered him incapable of trifling
concerns, and he therefore committed
them, as fast as he wrote, to Porphyry,
who, perhaps, labouring under the same
divine influence, was equally incapable
of orthography or sense."—The Platonist
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>

the Jews, tending to prove that they
should not be burnt.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER favourite project of Vau∣rien,
was that of assembling the dis∣persed
Hebrews. This impious project
(as a good Catholic terms it) was not pe∣culiar
to the political imagination of this
Gaul; since, among others, two of his
compatriots meditated the same design.
The Marquis of Langalerie, at the com∣mencement
of this century, disappointed
at every court to which he resorted, pre∣pared
to collect these fugitive Asiatics in
the isles of the Archipelago. A genius
of a sublimer character, the famous Mare∣chal
Saxe, having merely missed possessing
<PB N="215" REF="218"/>
the empire of Russia by his inconstancy
in love, solaced his ambition by a fanciful
sovereignty over the wanderers of Israel.
This project is of that inviting and plau∣sible
kind, that it will never be extinct
in the romantic and chimerical heads of
some fervid adventurers; but there exist
opposing reasons in the character of this
people, which, depending on principles
in nature, are irreversible. The children
of Jacob are composed of all nations, and
cannot blend alike with the people among
whom they reside; as there are metals in
nature, which no chymical process can
amalgamate with others.</P>
<P>Vaurien had made acquaintance with
a Jewish philosopher, and called on him
for the same purpose he had visited the
Platonist. He found the Jew at dinner,
eating pork-chops; and at the side of his
plate lie open the Jewish Mendelsohn's
Phaedon, a sublime imitation of Plato on
<PB N="216" REF="219"/>
the immortality of the soul. The Jew
desired to conclude his meal quietly, and
proceeded in employing at once his teeth
and his eyes; but the head digests not
like the mouth; and the Jew had now so
violently abstracted his imagination, that
Vaurien rose with impatience. The phi∣losopher
then started from his reverie, and
lamenting that the sublimest conceptions
were the obscurest, closed his Plato, and
listened to the Gallic Christian.</P>
<P>"How long shall philosophy," ex∣claimed
Vaurien, "mourn over the de∣gradation
of the human species? Our
great revolution ferments the spirits of
all our European youth, and of every
friend to the rights of man. France has
emancipated the negroes, France would
emancipate the Jews. Whenever the le∣gislator
violates the equality of nature,
the state appears to retain slaves; but, in
reality, it loses so many patriots. I was
<PB N="217" REF="220"/>
present at one of the late earthquakes in
Italy. The multitude were gazing on the
ruins of a town; the nobles sighed at the
vestiges of their grandeur; the opulent
citizens mourned their buried fortunes.
A voice from the multitude broke the
melancholy silence, exclaiming, 'Now WE
ARE ALL EQUAL.' A sublime and ter∣rible
truth! Unhappy is that country,
whatever be it's grandeur, in which a
great portion of it's citizens would con∣sider
exile as no punishment, and an
earthquake would communicate the sen∣sation
of delighted vengeance. And this
must be the feeling of every Indian Ne∣gro
and every European Jew. Every
where found, and no where respected,
wherever ye wander ye drag along the
same ignominious chain."</P>
<P>"You deliver yourself," replied the Jew,
"with the voluble eloquence of your na∣tion.
In this temperate climate we fear
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>
no earthquakes, and we are no friends to
such frantic revolutions. As a philoso∣pher,
I conceive it my duty, as it is my
pleasure, to correct popular errors by sim∣ple
truths. A philosophical history of the
Jews would be a history of human na∣ture;
no nation has assumed such a va∣riety
of aspects; their government was
theocratical, aristocratical, republican, and
monarchical; now tributary, and now ex∣acting
tributes; fugitive and stationary,
impoverished and opulent, superstitious
and enlightened; a people, now the most
ignorant in Europe, introduced those sci∣ences
which are cultivated by all men
but themselves.</P>
<P>"But a conversation must not be a dis∣sertion.
It is difficult to say little on
what we could say much. I shall confine
myself to some of the most prominent
popular prejudices.</P>
<P>"What has been the origin, between
the Christian and the Jew, of this impla∣cable
<PB N="219" REF="222"/>
hatred? Rivality. The principles
of Christianity are inimical to the princi∣ples

afterwards Christianity was enabled to

<P>"Not among the least of Hebrew grie∣vances
has been that of the Christians
having written their history. The Jews
are chiefly known by accounts drawn up
by their enemies, who have vilified with
monkish rancour, and perpetuated the
calumny of the day. Reflect on the ig∣norance
of the Christian ages; not that
Christianity necessarily includes ignorance,
but ignorance may include Christianity.

history a feeble voice, that, with a cautious
generosity, seems to whisper something for
the sufferers of Israel. Silent tears were
shed from the eye of philosophy. We now
live in an age when a man may tell his
fellow citizens, firmly and audibly, the
cause of his tears. Yet even in this age,
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
when this people attracted their attention,
have philosophers ceased to be philoso∣phers
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Voltaire, but neither Rousseau nor Mirabeau, was their enemy. Lately, when the learned Dohm, of Berlin, published his treatise, 'Sur la Reforme Po∣litique des Juiss,' Mr. Hartmann opposed that work of humanity. Sheridan has pourtrayed them in the old style. Voltaire, Hartmann, and Sheridan, Chris∣tian libertines, had been duped by some Jewish usurers. Mr. Hourwitz, a literary Jew of Poland, has composed the Apology of his nation with the energy of an Israelite roused into action, who, feel∣ing deeply, writes forcibly. He tells us, that he knows many young men have conceived a hatred against Jews, because several have supplied them with money, by which means they lost their health and their fortune. He knew a German magistrate, who persecuted all Jews, because, when young, by their money he had contracted a shameful disorder.—Such cases only shew that the prudent Jew knows the value of money, and the imprudent Christian is an abject slave of his unsubdued passions.</P>
<P>In our country I have seen with indignation Mr. Burke compose a <HI>diatribe</HI> against all Israelites, as money-lenders, clippers, and coiners, and what∣ever crimes his black imagination could create. His style is too beautiful to lose itself on such offensive subjects; it is a gilding sunshine that exhaust, it's splendour on a dunghill. Dr. Moore, in his Travels, benevolently abuses them. The pleasant Doctor, perhaps, envies some rich Jews he may happen to have met in the course of his peregrinations. Phi∣losophers write sometimes more than they think, and are therefore very liable to take <HI>effects</HI> for <HI>causes.</HI> The Jews may be all what they tell us they are; we enquire in our turn <HI>why</HI> they are so? are men born money-lenders? And <HI>why</HI> are those Christians, who are in the same predicament as the Jews, Jews in every thing but in the exterior?</P>
<P>To Mr. Cumberland the Israelites ought to be grateful: but they are too ignorant to be grateful. His comedy, performed in provincial towns, has loosned a little some cruel prejudices; but this wri∣ter's humanity is eccentric:<Q><L>A flattering painter, who made it his care</L>

adust, their nose aquiline, and their eyes
full and black; their cast of features is
frequently noble and expressive. The
more polished Jews, residing in England,
are the descendants of those emigrants

that it is a punishment for their

willing to accept this as an existing mi∣racle;
and Jews are willing to be con∣sidered

A philosopher, feeling none of these inte∣rests,
modestly pursues truth, and boldly
espouses her. All national effects are to
be traced to natural causes; every other

An artifice, for such it was, if not

a power durable as the universe.
Longinus termed Moses a genius of no
common magnitude.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire, Bolingbroke, and their school of phi∣losophy, have laboured diligently to persuade their readers, that Moses had never any other existence than that of some ancient heroes of romance; a Prince Arthur, whose <HI>name</HI> was a subject for ro∣mantic biographers. M. Pastoret, in his 'Moise consideré comme Legislateur et Moraliste,' p. 7. has proved that Moses is mentioned by a pagan writers; by Strabo, Justin, Menethon, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, and Apuleius; but their notices are equally romantic and uncertain.—In this work the reader will find a good analysis of the Mosaic legislation. It is learned, pious, and heavy. That philosophy is very narrow that gives, for the cause of the Jewish isolation, the strict inhibition of Moses against ido∣latrous practises. Idolatry has ceased, but they are still isolated.</NOTE>. Extending his
views with a vastness that ennobles but
not exceeds human sagacity, by rigid and
numerous customs which he consecrated
by their holiness, he has produced, from
<PB N="227" REF="230"/>
generation to generation, an inheritance
of manners; has rendered the domestic
life of a modern European the same as
an ancient Asiatic; and by his genius,
through this awful interval of time, still
influences the fugitives he headed, and iso∣lates
them among the most populous na∣tions.
What at first in his code seems mi∣nute,
frivolous, and absurd, is sublimely
political. The simple rite of circucision
he so sagaciously adopted as an indis∣pensable
duty, still further explains the
magnificent conception of Moses; per∣ceiving
that, mingled with other nations,
they might assimilate to their customs,
like small streams mingling with rivers,
he commanded an operation, which, per∣formed
in the infant state, compelled
every man to bear in his body the Juda∣ism
his heart had renounced.</P>
<P>"Another cause produced an universal
dispersion of Jews. Their commercial

character. Wherever a ship sailed, a
Jew voyaged; wherever a great town
was established, a Jew was it's inhabi∣tant.
It was necessary for them to se∣parate
that they might flourish. We
trace this fact in what relates to their
English history; they were numerous,
but not congregated. He who could
find no employment at York succeeded
at Norwich, or was enriched at Lincoln<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus we find them distinguished by their resi∣dence: Jocenus, the Jew of York; Jacob, of Nor∣wich; Sarah, the Jewess of Malmesbury, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
Their law not admitting of the military
profession, and animating them to con∣jugal
embraces, by considering sterility as
a malediction, their populousness became
remarkable; they lost not by the casu∣alties
of other nations, and accumulated
men as they did money, by regular arith∣metic.
If they had not suffered such ef∣fectual
<PB N="229" REF="232"/>
massacres, Europe might have ex∣hibited
the New Jerusalem.</P>
<P>"The origin of their proverbial wealth
is equally simple as the causes already as∣signed.
When Christianity was esta∣blished,
it degraded beneath the rank of
men the children of Jacob. Not merely
vassals, they were frequently bond-men.
With the other cattle the circumcised
slaves were transferred from proprietor to
proprietor. Earl Richard purchased of
his brother Henry III. his Jews, for a
lease, that (to employ the forcible ex∣pression
of Prynne) "those whom the
king had <HI>excoriated,</HI> he might <HI>eviscerate.</HI>"
A more remarkable instance is that of this
king, who, when he suspected the disaffec∣tion
of prince Edward, to confirm his
loyalty, made over the Jews to him;
and the following year prince Edward,
being as deeply indebted as his father,
transferred them, by a new assignment,

<P>"In this singular state industry was a
source of prosperity. Christians were
then most religious, little wise, and less
industrious. Jewish wealth increased,
and wealth produces privileges; they
were proud in a mock parliament, in a
chief justice, and an exchequer of their
own. Opulent, they still preserved the
closest frugality; abjectly penurious and
grossly sordid<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>A sketch of their domestic life is given by the quaint and witty Fuller, in his Church History, b. III. par. 37. "For first of their fare; it was coarse in the quality, and yet slender in the quan∣tity thereof; insomuch that they would in a man∣ner make pottage of a flint. Swiue's flesh, indeed, they would not eat, but dog's meat they would; I mean beef and mutton, so poor and lean that the refuse of all Christians was the Jews portion in the shambles. Their cloaths were so poor and patched, beggars would not take them up to have them. At∣tendants they kept none, every one waiting on himself. No wonder then if easily they did <HI>over∣grow</HI> others in wealth, who basely did <HI>underlive</HI> themselves in all convenient accommodations." And at par. 40. "Endless it were to reckon up the indig∣nities offered unto these Jews. Apprentices now-a-days do not throw sticks at cocks on Shrove Tues∣day so commonly as on that day they used clubs on the Jews, when they appeared out of their houses; a people equally unhappy at feasts or frays; for whenever the Christians at any revels made great entertainments, the Jews were made to pay the reckoning; and wheresoever any brawl be∣gan in London, it ended always in the Old Jewry, with the pillaging of the people therein."</P>
<P>Such is the jocular humanity of this honest Ecclesiastic! A similar character distinguishes the labours of the antiquary Tovey. Both these English writers of Jewish history felt as men, but some∣times reasoned as Christians.</P></NOTE>. Even to apologize for
these offensive manners, causes are not

difficult to be assigned. Their domestic

has accidentally preserved some interest∣ing
narratives of their patient sufferings,
their fervid affections, and their heroic
resistance.</P>
<P>"Where wealth is concentered among
the few, it finds persecutors among the

and miserable calculators. The
estates of the idle Christian were ingulphed
by the mortgages of the industrious Jew,
The sovereign with their opulence filled
his exhausted treasury, and the baron se∣curely
committed his rapine. Christian
injustice produced Jewish usury. The
price of money ever becomes propor∣tioned

Despair with the Jews was the parent of invention, and bills of exchange were imagined by them. At the moment, there was something sublime in the conception, to transfer, by a species of magic, to the most distant parts of the world, estates that could only have a local value, and wealth, enormous to the eye, readered in∣visible, yet real.</NOTE>, and then it was appa∣rent

<P>"At these periods calumnies were
propagated, sometimes absurd and some∣times
terrible, and indeed have been
continued to this enlightened period of
time. I could shew volumes of compiled
calumnies; I will confine myself to two.
They have been frequently accused of
crucifying children, and the chief narra∣tive
of this kind is even supported by
ten historians. This fact is instructive.
The agreement of several authors con∣cerning
some extraordinary circumstance
does not amount to it's proof; so many
say a thing because others have said it. To
<PB N="235" REF="238"/>
such writers we may apply the simile of
Dante:—<Q><L>Come le pecorelle escon dal chiuso,</L>
<L>* * * * * * * * * *</L>
<L>E cio che fa la prima l'altre fanno,</L>
<L>Addossandosi a lei s'ella s'arresta,</L>
<L>Semplici e chete, e lo imperché non sanno.</L></Q></P>
<P>"It is thus all history is composed:
nine of these historians copied from their
predecessors; and the original narrator
gives it as a rumour, and describes it as
a romance. I know not of any Jew who
was hanged for crucifying a child; but
I know, that when these accusations were
formed the king was very poor, and the
fines were very heavy. The Jews have
never used and <HI>wood</HI> for the purpose of
<HI>crucifying</HI> Christians, but the Christians
have employed a great deal for <HI>burning</HI>
Jews<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circumstance of the crucified child is even revived in the "Adventures of a Guinea," and so∣lemnly given as an example of Jewish hatred. Ano∣ther novel, "The Adventures of John Buncle," says, that "even the gay Jews have in contempt and abhorrence a country dance called, The little Jesus;" and the author adds, "They hate our holy religion beyond every thing."

The truth is, no rich Jew would become a
convert to christianity; the converts were
therefore picked out of the filth of the
streets; sordid in their manners as in their
occupations; but when baptized, they
passed through proper ablutions, were
perfumed, and dressed; the virtue of the
holy water had therefore nothing extra∣ordinary.</P>

<P>"Such has been the ancient state of
these men. A chronologer tells us, when
he arrives at a particular date, on this

York; and in the succeeding article, that
the king was crowned with great splendor
and rejoicing. I confess I cannot so calmly
pass over from massacre to revelry, nor
account murder, less murder, because it is
given in a collective manner. Some, I
believe, do not feel their heart more agi∣tated

There are Jewish poets and Jewish artists of eminence; and which, perhaps, exist no where but in Berlin, a Jewish academy of sciences, and a Jewish literary journal, composed in Hebrew. All these great men, during their youth, had to struggle with their poverty and their Talmud; but the ex∣ample of Moses Mendelsohn animated his people and his associates; his fellow citizen he instructed as a father, and his rival he cherished as a brother. Literary Jews must always be rare; no students are liable to such numerous obstacles; their most malig∣nant and powerful enemies will be found among their domestic associates. If a literary Christian is ma∣tured at thirty, a literary Jew can scarcely be ma∣tured at forty. They have therefore addicted them∣selves to those studies which are pursued without much connection with the manners of men. They have had severe metaphysicians and industrious na∣turalists, and have excelled in the profession and the science of medicine. Voltaire has addressed to Isaac Silva a poetical epistle, which gives immorta∣lity to the Jewish physician. In polite letters they have had no literary character of eminence; nor now does their stony soil put forth a solitary bloom of future genius.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="253"/>
Here the Jewish philosopher at length
ceased, and Vaurien departed, consider∣ing
that the Jew was by no means so
agreeable as the Platonist; that he shewed
more erudition than he wished to hear,
and was as little adapted for his politics
as for his amusement.</P>

<P>BESIDES the revolutionary assembly
at Lord Belfield's, unknown to his
Lordship a secret committee met at the
house of Mr. Reverberator. They now
joined, and Vaurien addressed them:—</P>
<P>"In England you have adopted two
modes of getting rid of your kings; the
reigns of Charles I. and James II. have
produced to your nation more real uti∣lity
than if they had been the most ex∣emplary
princes. They have taught all
sovereigns, that there are different man∣ners
of regal punishment; by death or
expulsion. Let every citizen give his
<PB N="252" REF="255"/>
opinion respecting the present monarch,
whom we have agreed to dethrone."</P>
<P>"Expel with a pension," said Sub∣tile.</P>
<P>"Expel with a pension," echoed Re∣verberator.</P>
<P>"Expel without a pension," cried Dr.
Bounce. "He never gave me a living."</P>
<P>"Behead him," said Rant.</P>
<P>"Assassinate him," exclaimed Dra∣gon.</P>
<P>"This last mode," observed Vaurien,
"combines expedition, safety, and tran∣quillity.
But this king, through a long
reign, has not <HI>rebelled</HI> against his people,
nor will his people easily rebel against a
sovereign, who, without imbecillity is
affectionate, without effeminacy is do∣mestic,
without tyranny is firm; a mo∣narch,
who, like another Augustus, suf∣fered
without a murmur, although it cost
a tear, the horrid calumnies of an eternal
<PB N="253" REF="256"/>
Aretine; yes, the father of his country suf∣fered
himself what he could not permit the
obscurest individual to suffer; he trusted
to the purity of his life, and to the voice
of his subjects; a sovereign, whose confi∣dence
in their affections <HI>was</HI> such, that
he would have reclined his head and slept
on the bosom of his meanest subject:
but kings must fall if we would rise."</P>
<P>"There is a vile rheumatic wind from
that door," exclaimed Subtile; "close it,
Reverberator."</P>
<P>Reverberator, after some ineffectual at∣tempts,
cried, "Curse the door, it will
neither open nor shut; the hinges are
dropt."</P>
<P>Vaurien smiled, observing, "the mo∣narchy
of that state then is dissolved. A
door must have it's hinges."</P>
<P>"But it does not follow," cried Dra∣gon,
with a frown, "that a state must
have it's king. You Gauls catch at
<PB N="254" REF="257"/>
every remote allusion, burlesque the so∣lemnity
of your councils, and ruin your
cause by your eloquence. Speak less,
think more, and let your arm be your
voice."</P>
<P>"A simile is harmless," replied Vau∣rien;
"but to proceed: May not the
assassin be assassinated? The king is
loved."</P>
<P>"A poisoned arrow blown through a
tube; it strikes like the lightning; the
invisible is alone traced in it's effect,"
cried Dragon.</P>
<P>"Well thought," observed Vaurien;
"kings to respect the people must fear
them; therefore they must be beheaded
or expelled."</P>
<P>"You observe," said Subtile, turning to
Reverberator, "how exact are my com∣putations!
This morning I calculated
all our opinions, and casting up all the
probabilities and the possibilities, I com∣puted
<PB N="255" REF="258"/>
a certitude, that this evening we
should determine on assassination. But I
have prepared another calculation. You
propose, Dragon, that it should take place
when the King goes to Parliament. The
chances are against you; for the wind
may blow against the arrow, or the arrow
may, for aught I know, be inhaled into
your own throat. Then, there are the
horses, who, added together with his Ma∣jesty,
make so many to one you miss.
We should never stir a foot without cal∣culation.
When Johnson entered a room
he used to number and to measure his
steps; it is thought to have been super∣stition;
I believe it was done metaphysi∣cally;
for it astonishes me, that not more
legs are broken daily, since few calculate
their steps, and a single one, too long, or
too short, may overset a man."</P>
<P>"Nature," said Vaurien, "effects her
facile operations without the intervention
<PB N="256" REF="259"/>
of metaphysics. We calculate nature, but
are only amused by our figures. A new
fact overturns an old system. Reflect,
my friends, on the necessity of dispatch.
What has been done at the Tower?"</P>
<P>Dragon replied, "This morning, for
two hours, the tri-coloured flag was hung
out, to the amazement and terror of the
town. I got a boy to do this, merely by
half an hour's conversation on liberty.
Boys form the best citizens; every argu∣ment
to them is new and incontrovertible.
I dare say, Citizen Rant, you find this at
your lectures."</P>
<P>To which Rant answered: "Citizens,
my lungs, my arms, my feet, this cadave∣rous
face, and these ferocious locks, flying
like the serpent hair of furies, perform
miracles among apprentices. I have learnt
the French language since the revolution.
I talk of Constantinople, while every one
knows I mean London; of Mahomet,
<PB N="257" REF="260"/>
when I strike at Jesus; and of a conspiracy
of the seven kings against the liberties of
infant Rome, when I clearly describe the
allied powers. It is thus I defy all law.
Helvetius did the same. Is not this ge∣nius
in <HI>me?</HI> All comes from Helvetius;
he is the <HI>ova</HI> of human nature. The
learned London Corresponding Society,
our respectable booksellers of 'Pig's-meat,'
and our political missionaries, deserve well
of the republic; but they persist all in
<HI>printing</HI> what they have to say. I have
<HI>printed</HI> in every class of literature; but
whatever is most energetic from my tri∣bune
makes no impression in <HI>print.</HI> My
works are like the acidity of lemon
squeezed on salts of wormwood; if the
instant froth is not caught 'tis vapidness!
My satire is termed outrageous ribaldry;
my eloquence, inflated gaudiness; my
thoughts, tedious common place; 'tis said,
I have neither simplicity nor dignity, nei∣ther
<PB N="258" REF="261"/>
nature nor rhetoric. But approach
my tribune, hear my screams of indigna∣tion,
my whispers of discovery, the foam∣ing
vengeance of my mouth, the thun∣dering
resolution of my arm, and the au∣dible
contempt of my foot. I assure you,
citizens, a living line of animation runs
along the room; I have seen the very
benches tremble with rapture, while the
opposite echo of my voice seems like that
of some divinity, heard, but not seen.
My butchers are resolute as the gladia∣tors
of Rome; my tailors are heroes to a
man; and my shoemakers are so many
Solons. The canaille are the nobility of
human nature."</P>
<P>"True," replied Vaurien; "and I have
always been surprised at your English ari∣stocratic
custom of decanting Port; you
carefully reject the dregs; but the dregs
are at once victual and drink, and con∣tain
more true spirit than the thin upper
<PB N="259" REF="262"/>
liquor. Our French wine has no dregs,
for it has no body; it is all alike, lively
and sparkling, but it will not keep; so we
drink it off all at once. Time only slat∣tens
and sours. Let us now understand
from citizen Dragon the conduct of his
proposed massacre."</P>
<P>Dragon now pushed on to the edge
of his chair, raised two blood-shot eyes
and a haggard countenance, then drawing
up part of his coat-sleeve till half his arm
was bared, addressed the committee:</P>
<P>"Exactly a month from this night, or about
one in the morning, I have prepared my
friends. We divide in three bodies. The
first assemble at Charing-cross under the
statue of the tyrant; the second collect
at the Tower; the third penetrate the
Bank. The Charing-cross party will de∣capitate
by torch-light; the Tower will
provde us with arms; but I fear we may
be disappointed at the Bank for money.
<PB N="260" REF="263"/>
However an active night does much;
when the sun rises we shall give up the
city to pillage; that will be a kind of
current coin for the people.</P>
<P>"When I was at Paris, I studied 'the
magnificent virtues of Robespierre, and
the energetic heroism of Danton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These are the <HI>express words</HI> to be found in Thelwall's <HI>sober</HI> reflections. And God forgive his <HI>sobriety!</HI></P>
<P>To some English readers Robespierre appeared a Cicero; but the genius of his oratory consisted in having retained some of the declamatory <HI>verbiage</HI> of the French writers. He was not known for any work, or other evidence of genius, before the vast concussion that threw such unworthy beings upper∣most. Danton was singularly illiterate, in disposi∣tion a ruffian, in heart a coward, but in person a giant. Barrere was, or is, <HI>un poete de province assez mince,</HI> a magazine contributor; Collot d'Herbois, an opera garetteer, <HI>un faiseur de petits vers.</HI> Such are the men, who had never been inscribed on the list of fame in France, and whose names had pe∣rished, had not something more monstrous than villainy urged them to become the Dracos of a great people. <HI>Great and virtuous republicans</HI> have bled on the guillotine; the names of Lavoisier, Bailly, and others, were known; but these obscure and vulgar villains, like so many Phaetons, incapable of con∣ducting the singular power to which they aspired, have themselves perished, after spreading a confla∣gration throughout the world.</P></NOTE>.' I
<PB N="261" REF="264"/>
consulted with the animated Barrere and
the calm and persevering Collot d'Her∣bois.
They conducted their massacres on
a new plan. They first set fire to part of
Lyons, without permitting a single mas∣sacre
to be performed in the burning
quarter, trusting to the justice of gun∣powder.
In the opposite quarters the
patriots were marshalled, and while they
performed their duties quietly on the in∣habitants,
the fugitives who escaped from
the flames were compelled to throw them∣selves
on their swords. This ingenious
contrivance succeeded tolerably; not so
much as they desired; and they afterwards
<PB N="262" REF="265"/>
very patriotically voted, when they per∣ceived
that they had only effected half a
massacre, to raze the magnificent city of
Lyons. Here you have 'hearts no bigger
than pins heads;' you would have hesi∣tated
at this sublime massacre."</P>
<P>"And do you mean," enquired Dr.
Bounce, "to destroy London in your
fury? Do you mean to burn my meeting
in the Old Jewry?"</P>
<P>"Do not disturb my reverie," conti∣nued
Dragon, darting a fiery glance on
Bounce. "That night the two Houses
shall be the lamps of liberty to illu∣minate
the metropolis. Those haughty
phantoms of state shall vanish. We shall
walk in blood; we shall see by flames.
At noon London will be half in ruins,
and half it's citizens be piled on each
other. Happy and fraternised people!
Liberty shall be the benign sunshine to
gild these horrors, and you shall be free
when you exult over your ruins."</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="266"/>
"How many can you assemble?" de∣manded
Vaurien.</P>
<P>"Three hundred," replied Dragon,
nodding earnestly.</P>
<P>"Calculate, calculate!" cried Subtile,
exultingly. "Not a probability; not a
possibility!"</P>
<P>"You have deceived us," cried Vau∣rien;
"I considered half of London was
at your devotion."</P>
<P>"Why, shall we not all unite?" conti∣nued
Dragon. "Rant has his appren∣tices.
Do you account liberated Newgate
as nothing? Is the King's Bench unfur∣nished
with true republicans? Is Bride∣well
destitute of patriots? Will not half
the young men of the day assemble when
we once begin?"</P>
<P>"Calculate, calculate!" repeated Sub∣tile.</P>
<P>"The Old Jewry is safe," said Dr.
Bounce, rubbing his hands.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="267"/>
"<HI>C'est un jeu perdu,</HI>" said Vaurien
"We must give up the massacre."</P>
<P>"Give up the massacre!" cried Dragon,
starting from his chair, and extending his
bared arm; "I will first massacre myself.
Rant, you are silent."</P>
<P>"I never open my mouth," replied the
Lecturer, "unless I can collect an au∣dience
of more than three hundred."</P>
<P>"None of you," cried Dragon, "have
made any progress in the philosophy of po∣litics.
How few assassinated Caesar! How
instantly did Massaniello effect his revo∣lution!
One night completed the con∣spiracy
of Fiesco; and Marius and Sylla
are immortal. Let us imitate the vast
designs and splendid deeds of great men.
In a cause like this the coward only is
avaricious of blood, and the fool only is
prodigal of words. A massacre in politics
is an electric shock; it calls forth a flame
from the coldest bodies. I have joined
<PB N="265" REF="268"/>
in glorious massacres. You must want a
feeble conception of the scene:—In the
silence and shade of night, when the still
air is almost heard, then like a summer
thunder suddenly bursting from all parts,
shouts and groans, the shrieks of women,
the clash of swords, the firing of pistols,
the lurid skies now dark with smoke now
red with flame, some fugitive and others
pursuing, the people now precipitating
and now precipitated, the streets kennel∣led
with blood, the passage obstructed by
corses, and the exulting eye of a true
patriot glutted and tranquil amid bound∣less
carnage: at such a moment, my
friends, every conspirator is ardent with
triumph, while every citizen is frozen
with terror. I entered a church at Paris
with but a few friends; above five hun∣dred
priests had sought an asylum; they
were chaunting Te Deum; when we en∣tered
all their voices were united, but
<PB N="266" REF="269"/>
not one resisted our daggers; we gradually
heard voice by voice decline, till only a so∣litary
accent sounded in the hollow arches
of the church; we left him to his fate,
protected by the corses of five hundred of
his slaughtered companions. Believe me,
the arm of an active patriot does not tire.
Let men be assembled, and I ask not a
minute to a man. You have heard of the
assassin of the Princess of Lamballe; I had
him over, but he has been shipped off;
he was a master. The rich cannot fight,
and the poor will. Place a well-fed spi∣der
with one who has been fasting for ten
months; the meagre one attacks, massa∣cres,
and gorges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious fact (verifying the singular absti∣nence of spiders) has been lately given by Mr. Vail∣lant, in his travels. He confined a spider in a glass bottle during the space of ten months; it lived, but it's belly was diminished to a point: he then in∣troduced a spider in vigour and condition. The spider, which had undergone such a Turkish rama∣zan, gazed on the stranger some time, and at length, alarm ceasing with familiarity, he fraternized with him with all his claws, and the rich and corpulent spider was soon pulled to pieces by the meagre and fa∣mished fellow citizen.</NOTE>. Men are spiders in
<PB N="267" REF="270"/>
this respect. Not a town in England but
will rise. Will not the French fleets be
safe in our ports?"</P>
<P>"Consider the winds, the winds," cried
Vaurien. "You are as sanguine as you
are sanguinary. You surely are diseased
with a calenture, and imagine the seas to
be green fields."</P>
<P>"Damn the winds!" retorted Dragon.
"Did not Monsieur Volney tell us, he
would manage them by this time? Are
we then to postpone a salutary massacre
for a N.W. or a N.E.? You then have
deceived me. I depended on the winds!"</P>
<P>"We cannot calculate the winds yet,"
observed Subtile; "but there is an ex∣isting
possibility of this next year."</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="271"/>
"Assuredly, or in ten thousand years
hence," said Reverberator.</P>
<P>"Damn your gigantic system!" ex∣claimed
Dragon; "you talk of ten thou∣sand
years, and suffer the existing hour
to pass away unnoticed, unknown, and
unused. Your whole life is reduced to
childhood."</P>
<P>"Nothing can be done with the Qua∣kers,"
said Vaurien. "My project of an
universal peace charmed, but my mode
terrified. My system is, however, well
calculated. France, by it's extent and
it's populousness, can hold out a war
longer than any neighbouring country;
so that when other nations are half de∣stroyed,
it will retain a respectable and
select number of republicans. In our cal∣culations
we look rather at the expence
of powder and ball than of men; we have
too many men, but are often in want of
ammunition. The genius of our new
<PB N="269" REF="272"/>
tactics is to fight incessantly by land,
and at sea to board the enemy, that we
may relieve ourselves from the superfluity
of our men. To destroy or be destroyed
is the only secret of our art. A diurnal
war of twenty years is therefore desirable.
I flatter myself two millions of our ene∣mies
might be annually got rid of. At
the close of the twenty years we should be
able to establish, what hitherto has been
the closet dream of the philosopher,—an
universal peace."</P>
<P>"Your calculation is commendable,"
replied Subtile; "but this general peace
greatly resembles the peace of a church∣yard.
It is a kind of peace which may
be already enjoyed in a desert. My pro∣ject
is evidently superior. I would not
slaughter, but <HI>reason</HI> with men. What are
the causes or motives of war? Many in∣deed
have been assigned, yet they are all
resolvable into one; the proposed ad∣vantage
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>
obtainable by a war. Now, of
advantages or disadvantages, no cri∣terion
exists but our conviction; it is,
therefore, a matter for argument. Na∣tions
at present make war before they
negotiate; they should negotiate before
they make war. A war rarely produces
any real benefit to either party, but is
attended with inevitable evil to both.
At a peace the contending nations rejoice;
rather should they mourn; then only they
perceive themselves placed amidst ruins
and desolations. A war has been often
kindled by a misterm in a treaty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This observation is verified by a recent fact. Thomas Paine complains of a verbal inaccuracy of the American treaty with England, which might serve for a substantial cause of a war. The treaty makes a concession to England to seize provisions and <HI>other articles</HI> in American ships. The term <HI>other articles,</HI> Thomas Paine affirms, includes <HI>all other ar∣ticles whatever.</HI> He conceives the detection of as much importance as our philosopher Subtile.</NOTE>: and
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>
thus also in law, which is another kind
of war. I was saved at the Old Bailey,
because the Attorney-general had mispelt
my name <HI>Subtile,</HI> by <HI>Subtle.</HI> A letter more
or less, a comma or a full stop, have fre∣quently
disturbed the peace of Europe.
I am of opinion that it is necessary to
convince the world, that instead of armies
composed of soldiers, it should only form
them of correct grammarians and expert
logicians. Nations quarrel because they
do not understand each other. Reason is
immutable; every obstacle is removed
by a lucid explanation. A treaty of war
would be more desirable than a battle of
war. Who could resist arguments strong∣ly
deduced, and grammar nicely correct?
There would be no misunderstandings,
for there would be no misterms."</P>
<P>"Grammer and reason!" exclaimed
Rant. "I give my vote of dissent in toto!
What would become of me and my works
<PB N="272" REF="275"/>
if grammer or reason were to be their cri∣terions?
Cannon and gunpowder are as
necessary as pen and ink."</P>
<P>"I am no great admirer, I confess, of
grammer and reason," said Reverberator.
"I have a natural antipathy to them;
for when I was an ostler at Newmarket,
I ever observed that certain anomalies in
the English language had the greatest ef∣fect
on my horses and my associates.
Some of our most energetic expressions
are both unreasonable and ungramma∣tical."</P>
<P>"Mr. Subtile is, however, just in what
he says respecting grammar and reason,"
said Dr. Bounce; "for had the writer of
the first chapter of Genesis but known
either, he would not have used the word
<HI>Elohim,</HI> which plural word, Gods, has
given to some a strong proof of the exist∣ence
of the Trinity, by which so many
honest men like myself are kept out of
the hierarchy."</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="276"/>
"I should fear," said Vaurien, turning
to Subtile, "that your treaties of war,
to be conducted by logic, would be as
deceptive as our present treaties of peace;
for it seems you can reason with equal
force on both sides. You can, Mr. Re∣verberator
informs me, prove that man is
a stone, and then, that a stone is not a
man."</P>
<P>"I can," replied Subtile, with an ex∣ulting
tone. "It is the easiest operation of
my logic; for it is performed by the mode
of the ancient syllogism. In my great
work you will find many propositions more
curious and extraordinary. To our pre∣sent
business. I do it thus: A stone is a
body; an animal is a body; man is an
animal; ergo, man is a stone. Again:
No stone is an animal; man is an animal;
ergo, man is not a stone. Let beings, I
repeat, rational and intelligent, act with
rationality and intelligence, and I confi∣dently
<PB N="274" REF="277"/>
affirm, that a sound logic would
conduct the affairs of the world more
forcibly than an iron world of soldiers."</P>
<P>"Most powerfully put!" replied Vau∣rien,
with a smile. "I am glad, however,
that you have extricated me from the
horror of petrifaction. Yet if I read your
great work, I become a petrifaction again.
Subtile, you merit the praise of our comic
poet: <Q><L>Raisonner est I'emploi de toute ma maison;</L>

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A final Project of the Gaul. A Character
of the French Nation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Vaurien reflected on the in∣determinations
of his secret com∣mittees,
the imbecillity of his coadjutors,
and the evident smallness of the number
of true republicans in this country, he
perceived that it was necessary to congre∣gate
men by other means than the pro∣jects
hitherto pursued. After profound
meditation, he sketched several plans
equally ingenious, and at length selected
one which appeared to promise an univer∣sal
confusion; to delight the young en∣thusiast
in his closet, the enlightened by
<PB N="276" REF="279"/>
honours rendered to science, the popu∣lace
by the astonishment of a new and
universal sensation, and the true republi∣can
by enabling such to meet for mutual
support, and, like David, to "number
his people."</P>
<P>He now sat down to compose this
great work. He entitled it, "A Procla∣mation,
in the name and authority of all
Nations," and he called himself, "Agent
General of all the Arts and Sciences."</P>
<P>It's design was an exhortation addres∣sed
to all the English, the Scotch, and the
Irish, to commemorate the birth, the
works, and the name of Newton. He
proposed that an act of parliament should
immediately decree a national edition of
his works; that his majesty should an∣nually
go in state to Newton's printing
press, and pay due homage to the art of
printing, as the emperor of China, to
reverence the art of agriculture, annually
<PB N="277" REF="280"/>
conducts the plough. That columns
sacred to Newton be erected in every
great town throughout the three sister
kingdoms; that the name of Newton be
inscribed among the princes of the royal
blood; that a new order of knighthood
be formed, called the Newtonian; that
his majesty should bestow on "the agent
for all the arts and sciences," the title of
"Sir Newton Vaurien;" that a Newtonian
fleet be prepared for new discoveries in
every quarter of the world; and finally,
that the house of the arch-philosopher,
which, we do not blush to relate, is at
present converted into an eating-house,
and eating is full as useful as philosophy,
should be raised into a magnificent tem∣ple,
his discoveries to be set to Handel's
music, and philosophical hymns to be
daily chanted to his memory throughout
these three kingdoms!</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281"/>
To defray the charges of this sublime
project, he proposed that two guinea
subscriptions be deposited at his banker's,
and that any surplus of money, after the
chop-house had been raised into a tem∣ple,
be applied to the relief of the poor,
in the manner so humanely recommended
by Dean Swift<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be necessary to inform most of my readers, that this entire project has been published in London, last year. See "De par toutes les Nations," a book to be purchased at Elmsley's. The author is Monsieur De la Blancherie, who Madame Roland mentions among her numerous train of lovers; this circumstance is creditable to his taste; whether it is to his politics I determine not. Monsieur De la Blancherie's intentions may be very innocent; all that I am informed is, that his zeal for the present project occasioned him to be threatened with the <HI>Alien Bill</HI>; but if he now resides in this country, it is an evidence of the justice of our government, and the simplicity of his heart. I will venture to assure this gentleman, that Newton is reverenced by Englishmen, not like <HI>true republicans,</HI> but <HI>honest men</HI>; not like <HI>boys,</HI> but <HI>students:</HI> they read his works with the same calm and slow sagacity by which the Briton formed them. A great man requires no other monument than his works; their energy re∣produces itself in a few kindred minds, and he is immortal because he lives in others.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282"/>
Such is the literal analysis of this ec∣centric
project! a cool and rational Bri∣ton
will instantly pronounce it the con∣ception
of infanity, and that no political
mischief could attend any similar publi∣cation;
as if great madmen were not to
the full as dangerous as great villains. If
Vaurien were mad, there was certainly
"a method in his madness;" but Vaurien
was in good health, although not in high
spirits, when he composed this great work.
It was a final project. Every exertion of
despair, if unsuccessful, is considered as
an act of lunacy, but attended with suc∣cess,
we then acknowledge it the sub∣lime
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>
invention of no ordinary genius.
This project ceases to be an absurdity
when confronted with some of a kindred
character realised in France. The re∣moval
of the bones of Voltaire and Rous∣seau,
carried with an idolatrous pomp to
the deification of a Pantheon, the na∣tional
commemoration of a ferocious li∣berty
by the exhibition of an allegorical
pantomime, and the national dresses,
motley and fantastical, in all forms and
all colours, were assuredly not extrava∣gancies
of lunatics, but puerilites of de∣signing
men; puerile only in their ap∣pearance,
invented to captivate the eye;
to please the fancies of women, to awe
youth into respect, and to divert the
passions of the multitude into any chan∣nel
of observation and converse, rather
than suffer them to roll their turbid
waves amidst the secreted fountain of
power. The <HI>infantes barbati,</HI> bearded in∣fants,
<PB N="281" REF="284"/>
are to be used as other boys, and
they give them harmless mockeries, that
they may not entertain themselves by
seising on the dangerous instruments of
men; but they will not permit the
children of nature to amuse themselves
with any other toys than those manufac∣tured
<HI>à la mode Parisienne.</HI></P>
<P>There was sagacity in this last attempt
of Vaurien. He had hitherto promised
to his patron rapid wonders, which should
be followed by each other with undeviat∣ing
and miraculous power. The Cardinal
De Rohan did not more revere the bust
of Cagliostro, whom he considered as the
great <HI>illuminé</HI> of the age, than Lord Bel∣field
confided in the head of Vaurien;
but the Gaul in every event had proved
the dupe of his own impetuous imagina∣tion.
The fleets of France were dispersed,
were taken, and were burnt. The Irish
were loyal, and felt a British indignation
<PB N="282" REF="285"/>
at a Gallic gasconade. The true repub∣licans
in London were too few to enu∣merate,
and too contemptible to listen
to. Bold, firm, and discontented men
he found, but their audible discontent
proved the freedom of our country. He
saw that our government felt all the in∣firmities
of long administrations; no go∣vernment
can reach a stationary perfec∣tion;
all were formed by human pas∣sions,
and all are carried on by contend∣ing
interests; every government is good
which is supportable. Vaurien saw that
ours could not be as pure and vigorous
as in it's youth of 1688; it's sound con∣stitution
is rather debilitated by luxu∣rious
ease, than imbecile by a pithless
and frigid age. He saw our press was
free, our juries were holy, our judges
honest; a minister may be censured and
impeached, and the voice of the people
can reach the throne; and the purity of
<PB N="283" REF="286"/>
our constitution had been tried in it's
fountain head. Vaurien had seen with
surprise, that a member, who professed
himself independent, could expel, when
he elevated his voice, a member who had
been spawned forth from the filth of
commercial corruption.</P>
<P>He perceived the imbecility of the
chiefs of his party, who assumed the
sovereignty of human opinion, and one
of whom only had a just claim to genius.
In vain the unfeeling, the sophistical, and
the metaphysical Subtile had chosen to
characterise free men, like herds of Yahoos;
in vain he had, with minute malice, and
hyperbolical calumny, artistly painted a
sombrous and terrific picture, which he
chose to term the English constitution;
in vain he had created a being with a
petrifaction for it's heart, ice-water for
it's blood, and clock-work for it's mo∣tion,
which he chose to term a man.
<PB N="284" REF="287"/>
Still more in vain was Reverberator, the
noon-tide shadow of this metaphysical
giant; his ten thousand years could only
occasion the laugh, forgotten with the
moment. When Vaurien heard him af∣firm
the wonderful influence of mind
over the exterior organization, and that
life might be prolonged at will, and
looked on this philosopher of eternity, he
smiled to view a diminutive frame, a
shrunken countenance, a man broken
down in the maturity of life, whose volu∣bility
was interrupted by an asthma,
whose vigour marched with tottering legs,
and whose boldness trembled with shat∣tered
nerves. This Reverberator, who,
conceiving that all things were acquirable
by the perserverance of habit, attempt∣ed
in his walk to take large strides, that
he might gradually make a gigantic step;
to diminish his food by slow gradations,
that in time he might exist with the
<PB N="285" REF="288"/>
least, or possibly without any food; and
on the same principle, straining and ema∣ciating
his mind with his body, attempt∣ed
to become a man of genius, by writ∣ing
comedies without taste, poetry with∣out
imagination, and politics in a rage.
From Sympathy he could expect little,
since although he was willing to overturn
all religion, he still retained so much of
the priest as to insist on becoming an
archbishop of Canterbury. For the rest
of the society, peace be to their manes!</P>
<P>Situated thus, desolate in hope, and
active in despair, he published this eccen∣tric
proclamation, and resigned it to the
influence of chance; chance, to which so
many great characters have had recourse,
and which he knew, in the most complicated
and ruinous game, sometimes turns up
the dice which decides our fortune.</P>
<P>Vaurien had ill calculated the genius
of our nation. He had committed the
<PB N="286" REF="289"/>
error of his Parisian friends; they think
we resemble them; that is, they consider
us as men much worse than we are.
They have examined some loose rotten
bricks which have fallen from the British
edifice, and decide on the wondrous
piles by some natural casualties. In vain
we are told, that all men are the same
men. National characters are opposite.
To moral, and not to physical causes, can
be ascribed that hostility of opinions,
which has, from age to age, removed, at
so vast an interval, the genius of these
neighbouring nations. The same winter
and summer refrigerate and heat Paris and
London, but not the same well-poised
government and the same domestic vir∣tues.
Taste, is a criterion of national cha∣racter.
Voltaire never comprehended the
genius of Shakespeare; Johnson never
tasted the ingenuity of Voltaire. An
English and French student peruse the
<PB N="287" REF="290"/>
same authors, but do not write the same
sentiments. Even the severity of meta∣physics
in France has been rendered a
vehicle of entertainment for women<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Helvetius, the fashionable French metaphysi∣cian, is tolerably characterised by Whitehead, who wrote this at the time his works first appeared.<Q><L>Is't not enough Helvetius <HI>schentes</HI></L>

but when Subtile followed with mea∣sured
steps the paths of these airy Gauls,
he could not soften his austerity with
their superficial gaiety. We cannot ac∣quire
the volatilised delicacy, the lighter
graces, and the susceptible and feminine
imagination of the French.</P>
<P>Redoubtable they are in politics, for
they execute rapidly what they project
incessantly; insidious in their profes∣sions,
<PB N="288" REF="291"/>
subtile in their hypocrisy, and san∣guinary
in their power. In France they
feel to inexpressible delicacy, or to incon∣ceivable
horror; their individual mur∣ders
have ever been characterised by pe∣culiar
and complex barbarity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long ere their national genius broke out in recent massacres, it was to be traced in their <HI>private murders,</HI> which were conducted by singular intri∣cacy, and perpetrated with singular horror. A lady of rank, to revenge her lover confined in the Bastile, poisoned her father, her brother, and others of the family. A female rival visiting her friend when she lay-in, put arsenick in the broth. A Frenchman invited a country family, consisting of four persons, to his house, and by a most inventive plan separated them, murdered every individual, and took possession of their estate; another in England, after having murdered his landlady, during a whole week was employed in calmly dividing the corse in small portions. A number of similar authentic facts might be given. They have ever exhibited a most inventive method in their cruelties, and the revo∣lution has only shewn the world that national cha∣racter which has long been known to the philoso∣pher.</NOTE>; impe∣tuous
<PB N="289" REF="292"/>
feelings are fugitive, and take
an opposite direction; they commit
murders, and then inscribe "ICI L'ON
DANSE." Women in all things, they
are women in vengeance. Impatient of
restraint, in war, a siege discourages and
repels them; in peace, an orderly consti∣tution
could neither excite their love
nor their reverence. Terrible in assault,
contemptible in slight; vast in their
projects, imbecile in their pursuits; capa∣ble
of imagining all things, incapable of
performing any. They triumph for a
moment, and despair through a century.
Of all nations, they alone have felt that
calenture of political imagination, which
has aspired to an universal monarchy or
an universal republic; but they have
never known that British vigour of judg∣ment,
which could form for Englishmen
the most perfect constitution humanity
can suffer. When the French were <HI>slaves,</HI>
us they reverenced; when <HI>free,</HI> us they
<PB N="290" REF="293"/>
imitated; now <HI>licentious,</HI> they envy and
they hate. Europe they may afflict with
continued revolutions; yet may their
designs be frustrated; ONE revolution
was sufficient for the English. Danger∣ous
rivals, for they address themselves to
the imagination; they seduce the eye
and inflame the heart; they mingle pro∣minent
virtues, which conceal their radi∣cal
viciousness; incapable of persever∣ance,
but they will perish in their cause
if destruction comes rapidly; they will
declaim on freedom, when they exercise
tyranny; revere the humanity of peace,
while their hand is armed with death;
they will reform prejudices, while they
introduce prejudices still more calamitous;
they term themselves citizens of the world,
while they sly from place to place, and
only leave in their career the memory
of their desolations. They come to de∣stroy
or be destroyed; to fraternize with
them were to embrace and to perish.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="294"/>
The French resemble water-melons, of
which, proverbially, not one in a thousand
tastes with perfection; their liquor is
aqueous, and rarely delicious; while the
English, like the cocoa-nut, bear a rough
and hard incrustation, which protects the
milk of human kindness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this work has assumed in it's progress a deeper political cast than the author at first proposed, he conceives it necessary here to add, that he loves the cause of free∣dom above all other human interests. He rejoiced at the French revolution, and exulted to view that to <HI>English principles</HI> was that great nation indebted for it's libera∣tion. It's fatal progress has only shewn, what some sus∣pected, that <HI>slaves</HI> are not immediately prepared to be∣come <HI>freemen.</HI> It is now fashionable to lay the disastrous events of this barbarous war entirely to the misconduct of ministers. The writer professes neither admiration nor esteem for a financial administration, disgraceful to England, and the avowed enemies of letters and philoso∣phy: but thus much he will urge for any minister, that when some part must be adopted, if this part prove unfortunate, there immediately arises an opposite faction, who, with affected fagacity, trace the beneficial effects of a <HI>contre</HI> operation. It is evident that this sagacity is very easily acquired; and when it is noisy or clo∣quent, influences the unthinking mob.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">More of Vaurien's Loves and Friendships.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now time to imitate the manner
of Rapin in his history, who, when he
has finished a certain portion of the af∣fairs
of the state, as we have done, re∣turns
to wind up those of the church,
and then on to the state, and then back∣wards
to the church; a comfortable and
unfatiguing regularity we much envy.
We novelists are classed beneath our
brothers who profess <HI>authentic</HI> history, and
yet we have to feed the fire of our imagi∣nation
with the most costly aromatics;
but the fire of an historian is extremely
small, and kept up by mere wood and
coal. But as the eyes of most people are
more perfect than the delicacy of their
<PB N="293" REF="296"/>
olfactory nerves, it has happened that
historians are considered as sublime per∣sonages,
and we as nugatory trislers. As
for <HI>our</HI> church affairs, they are much ea∣sier
to narrate than those of the other
historians, a church being the very <HI>last</HI>
object of a novelist's attention. It is
with us as with many other men; to go to
church for marriage is an act of despair;
and when we discover that we are in an
exhausted state, to save our reputation
we have recourse to the parson.</P>
<P>Emily with secret pleasure now gazed
on Vaurien. She felt the same degree
of fascinated affection as Charles experi∣enced.
Placed in a similar situation,
they mutually loved and hated. When
Emily listened to Lady Belfield, she con∣ceived
ideas of contempt; and to Vau∣rien,
of confirmed horror relative to
Charles. Of the character of Mrs. Wil∣son
she had received indubitable evi∣dence.
<PB N="294" REF="297"/>
She and Charles felt alike; for
the innocence and purity of both were
the marked victims of the disappointed
passion of her Ladyship, and the cruel
malice of the Gaul. Yet it is worthy
of observation, that all these compli∣cated
mischiefs were originally derived
from a young man's charity for a misera∣ble
prostitute!</P>
<P>Emily had scarcely resided a month with
Lady Belfield when she found her depen∣dent
life even more wretched than with
the daughter of the loan-contractor. The
beauty and dissipation of Miss Million by
no means rivalled those of her Ladyship;
and having been born in Pudding-lane,
she was not so expert and creative in her
derelictions from decency and virtue as
her rival, who had been born in Grosve∣nor-square;
and yet we shall not have
recourse to <HI>climate</HI> to solve this problem,
<PB N="295" REF="298"/>
as many other philosophers would. She
had not yet seized on the natural genius
of dissipation; for it is by no means a
facile labour to become the most aban∣doned
and the most amiable of women;
an experienced taste is required even in
the selection of impurities.</P>
<P>The domestic manners of her Lady∣ship
were viewed with a sensation of horror.
A stranger to her Lord, yet residing un∣der
the same roof; when describing
the embarrassments of their fortune, her
high play she termed a national debt;
an avowed and criminal intercourse with
her favourites was called a <HI>fleurette,</HI>
and with her claimants a stamped re∣ceipt.
Her private conversations alarmed
her hourly; for her Ladyship, to give an
evidence of her friendship, threw off her
reserve, and, like the Duessa of Spenser,
discovered under the gay and brilliant
<PB N="296" REF="299"/>
dress by which she enchanted the public
eye, a form of demoniac ugliness and vi∣cious
distortion.</P>
<P>In Vaurien Emily perceived nothing
but humanity and accomplishment. He
too wore a beautiful mask; but art had
so emulated nature, that if the innocent
Emily mistook a mask for a face, others
of more experienced sagacity had been
alike deceived.</P>
<P>Sometimes when she sat alone her
thoughts wandered to Charles; his image
had been placed on the altar of her heart,
and we do not readily break the idols which
we once have worshipped. Yet on Vau∣rien
she looked as on her protector, and fa∣cilitated,
by the desolation of her hopes
and the urgency of her wants, the de∣signs
he meditated.</P>
<P>In the mean while Vaurien perceived
the growing passion of his rival, who, in
the confidence of his friendship, con∣fessed
<PB N="297" REF="300"/>
the restless emotions of his bosom.
"To love her," said Charles, "who me∣rits
not love, is a fascination. It is in
vain I combat and I resolve; when her
image comes before me, every thought
turns to her; eternally I gaze on that in∣tellectual
phantom which takes the pure
form without the impure mind of this
girl." Vaurien was alike convinced of
Emily's predilection for Charles; because
not only he had caught her abrupt mo∣nologue,
which we have given, at the
moment she had discovered the character
of Mrs. Wilson, but also because she made
frequent enquiries concerning Charles,
and mourned over his character less with
the regret of displeasure, than with the
grief of passion.</P>
<P>Charles, although he would not enter
the house of Belfield, was induced, by his
restless anxiety, to enquire concerning
Emily of her maid. By her he disco∣vered
that she was far from being of con∣genial
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>
dispositions with her Ladyship,
with whom she did not appear on the
easiest terms; that she was melancholy,
and often had been observed in tears.
The maid, however, confessed that Emily
seemed much delighted by the society of
Vaurien, that she often played to him on
her harp, that they passed hours in con∣versation,
and that she consulted with
him on every pressing occasion. The in∣terrupted
connection between her Lady∣ship
and Emily he attributed to the spi∣rit
of rivalry, while the latter part of the
information amply confirmed her charac∣ter,
according to the descriptions of his
friend Vaurien.</P>
<P>His agitated spirits preyed on his
frame, and his health visibly declined.
In his literary pursuits he gave marks of
the distraction of his mind; and some
singular blunders he had committed con∣vinced
Johnson that he concealed some
powerful emotion, too apparent in it's
<PB N="299" REF="302"/>
effects. He said to him one day, "My
good friend, I did not know you was the
absent man; but you will ruin me. You
inserted, I find, in Mr. Snowden's Tra∣vels
to Russia, Mr. Fervid's description
of his newly-discovered island under the
Line; and you have sent to the printer
of the British Critic, the article on the
abolishment of episcopacy, which was
meant for the Critical Review, while
this month the Critical contains that
orthodox dissertation to prove the nature
of the Trinity on the principles of com∣mon
sense. The literary world is in con∣fusion.
The Rivingtons menace with
the pillory; the Robinsons (who <HI>yet</HI> do
not command the pillory) threaten to
starve me out of employment. You
know that all the arts and sciences, all
the wit and genius of the age, are ab∣solutely
under controul of the Rivingtons
and the Robinsons, brothers and book∣sellers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The former, publishers of the 'British Critic,' and the latter, of the 'Critical Review.' It is sup∣posed that Messrs. Rivingtons occasionally write some of the Greek articles in the 'British Critic,' and that Messrs. Robinsons write what articles they chuse. I have no objection to <HI>their</HI> writing, and return thanks for many kind notices respecting my∣self, which I will labour to merit; but I consider them as the Anthonies and Octavius's of the repub∣lic of letters, and hope they will not treat me in the present instance as the great Cicero was treated, that is, after having been massacred and mutilated, frag∣ments of his corse were hung up in terrorem to the public eye. I desire therefore they would be careful of the <HI>extracts</HI> they make, which form the fragments of an author's dead body.</NOTE>." <PB N="300" REF="303"/>
Charles desired to relinquish
his pursuits, acknowledged himself ab∣sorbed
in a passion fatal to his repose,
that he loved an object who merited
not love, and now related the history of
Emily, which he had hitherto concealed.</P>
<P>Johnson instantly insinuated an idea,
<PB N="301" REF="304"/>
that Vaurien had been deceiving him re∣specting
the character of Emily.</P>
<P>"Impossible!" replied Charles. "Would
the man who with one hand has given me
the means of subsistence snatch from me
with the other it's only enjoyment?"</P>
<P>Johnson having received his promise
that he would never more touch another
manuscript, assured him that he would
soon give him more certain evidence of
the artifice of the Gaul.</P>
<P>He seized on the earliest opportunity
of conferring with Emily, and delighted
her, when she was assured that Charles
was virtuous and impassioned.</P>
<P>"And whence," she enquired, "his
shameless connection with an abject be∣ing?"</P>
<P>"Eccentric humanity! That being is
a virtuous woman. We must learn to
correct our prejudices if we would not
<PB N="302" REF="305"/>
too frequently pierce with an added sting
the bleeding bosom of virtuous misfor∣tune.
What she related is true; but she
could not relate all. Her modesty con∣cealed
her incontinence." Johnson related
her interesting connection with Charles.
When he had finished, Emily raised her
eyes to heaven, exclaiming, "My father,
once have you erred! Virtue, then, may
assume a criminal appearance. Sister of
affliction! where does she now wander?
Victim of prejudice and delicacy! I could
now embrace her with the confidence of
virtue. I could press this woman, who
was a prostitute, to my artless bosom, as
an image of maternal affection. Tell Mr.
Charles he is an excellent young man; if
I ceased to esteem him, the cause of that
cessation will convince him that I now
must esteem him but the more."</P>
<P>"If you esteem him," said Johnson,
then have I an accusation against you.
<PB N="303" REF="306"/>
Charles knows that you are attached to
Vaurien, and take a visible delight in his
society."</P>
<P>"I am only born," replied Emily, "to
be deceived. Yes, Vaurien's accomplish∣ments
were eloquent, and his virtues were
splendid. His character now becomes un∣intelligible.
Is he then a villain?—Ah,
my father! are you again right? My
father, Sir, at his death, exhorted me to
'fly the agreeable.'—I should not then
have incurred this just imputation."</P>
<P>"Your father," observed Johnson,
counselled you wisely; the agreeable ever
make an easy conquest of your sex."</P>
<P>When these mysteries were elucidated,
Vaurien discovered them in Emily's coun∣tenance
and conversation. She at length
accused him of his ungenerous treatment
of Charles.</P>
<P>Vaurien paused some minutes, then
raising his hands, exclaimed with energy,
<PB N="304" REF="307"/>
—"I appeal to heaven that I am not
ungenerous! This man, and no doubt
this woman, even at this moment, exist
on my bounty! Since he provokes the
discovery I have concealed, blame me not
for the confidence I have held religiously
inviolate. I will shew you his bond. All
this can be but a collusion of the wretch∣ed
parties. As for this Charles he is no
where to be found; he has suddenly dis∣appeared."</P>
<P>He now shewed Emily the bond, which
was for five hundred pounds; as she
looked on it, mingled sensations agitated;
the generous concealment of Vaurien
waked a beaming pleasure in her eyes;
the silence, the connections, and the flight
of Charles gave a poignant reproach to
her heart; her face burned with indigna∣tion;
her eye softened with delight; the
amiable character of Vaurien rose to her
mind;—and when she turned towards Vau∣rien,
<PB N="305" REF="308"/>
she gazed on an animated Adonis,
listened to tones that melodised her soul,
and was dazzled by eyes that melted with
their tenderest fires. He threw himself
at her feet, confessed himself her adorer,
and moaned in such despair at the treach∣ery
and envy of Charles, that Emily, in
piteously listening, shed tears with the
tears of Vaurien.</P>
<P>This was one of those moments of
activity with the Gaul, in which his
genius instantaneously performed what
the slow conceptions of vulgar villains
could not have atchieved by repeated
deliberations. When he could force him∣self
to resist the overflowing sympathy of
the artless Emily, he had Charles imme∣diately
arrested, and by a weighty bribe
gained over his keeper to deliver to him
any letters he might write. This done, he
forged a letter to Johnson, in Charles's
hand-writing. Vaurien was expert in coun∣terfeiting
hand, and at Naples his inge∣nuity
<PB N="306" REF="309"/>
had once nearly been rewarded by
having his hand severed; but he had
timely decamped, preserving, with the in∣strument
of his art all it's former skill.
In this letter to Johnson Charles was made
to inform him, that he was compelled
to quit the kingdom in haste and trepi∣dation;
that hitherto he had played the
hypocrite; that his attachment to Mrs.
Wilson had been of a very ancient stand∣ing,
and had proved ruinous; and finally,
he desired Johnson would call on Vaurien,
to thank him for the considerable sum he
owed him, but which he could never
repay.</P>
<P>Johnson read the letter with silent asto∣nishment.
He examined and re-exa∣mined.
Charles did not appear, and every
letter was evidently of his writing. He
hastened to Vaurien and Emily; each
shared in the same astonishment. John∣son,
whose suspicion had not entirely de∣serted
<PB N="307" REF="310"/>
him, scrupulously examined the
countenance of Vaurien; never man ap∣peared
more poignantly afflicted. He ex∣pressed
little, and scarcely were his words
audible; a tear trickled on his cheek;
he wrung his hands; he looked sometimes
on Emily, and sometimes on Johnson,
shook his head, and groaned.</P>
<P>When Johnson was quitting the house,
he heard of so many of Vaurien's liberali∣ties
to the domestics, that his spontane∣ous
loan to Charles ceased to be extraor∣dinary.
William told him, that had it
not been for Vaurien he should not have
known what had become of his father's
soul, since without his generosity it had
never rested in church ground. A collec∣tion
of mendicants was waiting at the
door to receive Vaurien's weekly stipend.
This man, thought Johnson, must be
what he seems, and my national preju∣dices
have injured him.</P>

<P>THUS were affairs situated at the time
Vaurien's Newtonian system was pub∣lished.
Charles in prison was as melan∣choly
as Jeremiah, forming lamentations
on modern friendships; and this Pythias
conceived himself betrayed by one Da∣mon,
and deserted by another. Vaurien
perceived that the compass of his fate
was closing the circle it described, and
that the commemoration of Newton's
same seemed to be left entirely to the
planetary system he had formed, and that
he, who had inscribed his works on the
face of heaven must regard with a smile
the earthly celebrations of mortality.
<PB N="309" REF="312"/>
Some friends of Lord Belfield had in∣formed
his Lordship, that he had en∣tertained
a dangerous adventurer; that
among the privileges of nobility was not
accounted that of an exemption from
impeachment; and, besides, they assured
his Lordship, that his physicians were of
opinion that a change of climate was
absolutely necessary for his health. His
Lordship, indeed, was of the same opi∣nion,
not in respect to his health, which
he affirmed was vigorous, but to his af∣fairs,
which he acknowledged were disor∣dered;
and the voice of a creditor is as awe∣ful
as that of a physician; they both con∣vince
the patient that he can expect no
quiet unless he slies from their regular
attendance.</P>
<P>Vaurien had now fixed the bias in the
sensitive heart of Emily, and he was anti∣cipating
the moment of her fall. He had
consulted with Lady Belfield, and the
<PB N="310" REF="313"/>
boudoir of her ladyship had been selcted
as the altar on which the virgin victim
was to bleed.</P>
<P>The great events of great men are go∣verned
by the same capricious influence
which directs the little events of little
men. The web of fate is woven by the
hand of fortune, and she, industrious
yet indiscriminate spinster, takes the ca∣sual
ball from her basket, and careless
works, now with threads of gold, and now
with damaged yarn. She weaves on our
fate, but makes no distinction of per∣sonages.
The hero frequently envies the
bandit; for often the latter has found his
existence to be a triumph over innocence,
while the former has perished in the act
of his injustice. Every thing in this
world seems good or ill fortune, and the
events of fortune are suspended on the
slightest accidents; a plank immerges the
<PB N="311" REF="314"/>
conspirator into seas, stormy and profound
as his designs, in the hour of exultation,
and a pebble is slung into the head of
the giant in the hour of confidence.</P>
<P>Lord Belfield was bitterly reproaching
Vaurien for his abortive and vast designs.
He had at length discovered that he was
a fertile tree, luxuriant in leaves, but void
of fruit; and complained much in the
style which a ruined lover of alchymy
would formerly have employed to some
beggarly gold-maker, who had promised
to roof and floor his apartments in the
Mexican fashion, before the Spaniards ar∣rived;
but after the multifarious indus∣try
of years, lo! a furnace had burst with
a terrible explosion, or at the very crisis,
the <HI>aurum potabile</HI> in the crucible was
whisked down by a cat's tail. Great or
little causes, Vaurien averred, had hi∣therto
frustrated his comprehensive sys∣tem.
While they were computing, like
<PB N="312" REF="315"/>
two Subtiles, what is evidence and what
is only equivalent to evidence, intelligence
was brought, that Messrs. Dragon and
Rant were arrested for high-treason; a
quarter of an hour afterwards Monsieur
Vaurien received a note of epigrammatic
conciseness from Mr. Dundas, without a
scotticism or a vulgarism. It there ap∣peared,
that this hospitable country dis∣missed
the Gaul, and in twenty-four hours
were the seas to receive Vaurien. A
breathless friend rushed in, to intreat his
Lordship to set off instantly on his tour
through Europe. "Your government
(observed Vaurien) are adopting Subtile's
system of punishment; it makes us all
travellers. I have long been one. To
me the chances and the changes of for∣tune
have by custom an uniformity in
their varieties. My chimerical head has
considered Europe as the inheritance of
every sublime politician in these periods
<PB N="313" REF="316"/>
of revolution; but I fear that my shadow
will ever be reflected on the earth of my
neighbours, and never on my own."</P>
<P>Vaurien was collected and intrepid,
and he would have been equally so had
the letter of Dundas been his Majesty's
order, signed for his execution. Mithri∣dates
and Hannibal carried about them
an antidote against poison; and had Vau∣rien
been now in modern Italy, he would
have continued the precaution which these
great men used in ancient Italy; but in
these northern climates he knew we only
poisoned rats. What communicated this
intrepidity to the Gaul, was a persuasion
that he was born to suffer a public death.
What is inevitable, to a superior mind
conveys no terror. Whether the philoso∣pher
was to be hanged, guillotined, be∣headed,
broken on the wheel, or empaled,
he knew not, the mode entirely depend∣ing
<PB N="314" REF="317"/>
on the customs of that country where
he was to make his final exit.</P>
<P>"<HI>Eh, bien!</HI> (thought Vaurien, as he
was filling his portmanteau) the liberty
of these Britons is like a bottle of their
Port, locked in a glass beaufet; they see
it, and there it is—but only taste it at
the option of their master, who keeps the
key at his own disposal. Their liberty
will not intoxicate their heads. Here
the people submit to the laws—damned fools!—the laws must be sub∣mitted
to the people—there should be NO
LAWS at all, as Subtile says, and then, if
there were no laws, every thing would be
lawful.</P>
<P>"<HI>Diable!</HI> (he exclaimed, as he lifted
his portmanteau) I carry nothing away
from this opulent country. I play my
cards ill. After all my shooting parties
with that school-boy of Naples, he would
<PB N="315" REF="318"/>
have spoiled my hand-writing for the for∣gery
on the Treasury. Spain I lost by
those garlick-digesting grandees, because
I desired to curtail their names. I mis∣took
the real number of my confederates
when I looked over my papers; as they
appeared in writing, I imagined every
single man to be at least six. I thought
I had an entire family when I discovered
I had only a hot-brained boy. The Prussian
idiot I had persuaded, for I knew it would
win him, that he was an <HI>invisible,</HI> an <HI>illu∣miné</HI>;
I used to tread on his feet, and then
entreat his pardon for my not being able to
see him. All my party did the same; his
Majesty was buffetted about the whole
day, which quite flattered his powers of
<HI>invisibility.</HI> The court of Berlin had been
our's, but for the minister, who, while he
received English money, persisted in as∣suring
his Majesty that we were im∣postors,
and that his palpable obesity was
<PB N="316" REF="319"/>
not of so spiritual a kind, as ever to es∣cape
the eye. Rome had been mine,
but for those Cardinals who call them∣selves
<HI>nephews</HI> of the Pope; but I found
that they were more accurate in calling
him their holy <HI>father.</HI> The Ottoman and
the Russian empires are fair and open
fields; but they are too distant for the
moment. In America I have friends at
work, who will burn the place if they do
not succeed. There is no room for me.
I do not chuse to be a hermit amid a
hundred thousand acres. The Dutch are
near—sanguinary and unfeeling I knew
the boors were; but little imagined that
those unwieldly porpoises, sleeping in stag∣nated
water, should ever leap out to frolic
with uncouth airiness to the national tune
of the Marseillois hymn.</P>
<P>"But, the possession of Emily I have
missed for a single day! A kingdom I
can always discover, but a child of love
<PB N="317" REF="320"/>
and nature kingdoms may not present.
Charles remains in prison. From either
I derive no further benefit, and I wish no
being unhappy who impedes not my
political views."—He now took his
pen, and addressed the following letter to
Emily.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Admirable Emily!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When you receive this letter, Vau∣rien
is on the seas. Here my projects
are concluded, and the sole passion that
now occupies my thoughts is my bene∣volence.</P>
<P>You have escaped, sweet bird of
love! but in the depths of night the
lights were placed, and the net Lady
Belfield and myself have long woven
was at this moment to have closed on
you. Child of nature, and woman of
beauty! your unsuspicious innocence was
the magic that attracted, and the magic
<PB N="318" REF="321"/>
that would have precipitated your ruin.
I have already proved seductive to your
mind; and the mind of an accomplished
woman (a mere creature made up of ima∣gination
and sensibility) when once pos∣sessed,
is securing a party in the fortress,
who will soon be too strong for any oppo∣sition
at the outworks.</P>
<P>Nature has been prodigal to me,
but art has even exceeded her liberalities.
Had I lived in England, I had rendered
you the most miserable of your sex; but
since I am banished from it, I will render
you the most happy.</P>
<P>All that I have insinuated relative to
Charles and Mrs. Wilson is a foul inven∣tion
of too common a kind to have cost
me any difficulty. Domestic treasons are
beneath me; it is only national treasons
which I feel as my genius, and consider
as my glory. My dear girl, in this head
of mine revolve all the cabinet secrets of
<PB N="319" REF="322"/>
Europe; Monarchs I have deceived,
Dukes I have ruined, and Ministers I
have embarrassed. You now perceive
I claim no merit in having deluded a
country lad and lass.</P>
<P>Are you not surprised at my <HI>gaieté de
coeur?</HI> What, you conceive me at this
moment, immersed in thought, and con∣founded
by disappointment! It is pre∣cisely
at moments like this, when I am
engaged in no particular project, that,
free from politics, I feel myself, and act
the man. With you I have ever been
serious and sentimental; yet, could you
have <HI>then</HI> listened to my conversations
with her Ladyship, if your eyes had had
intelligence, I assure you our faces were too
frequently most impolitical; but I trusted
in your boundless simplicity, as you confi∣ded
in my boundless art. You have there∣fore
no conception of my character. You
have often said, we feel more than we
express; but I express more than I feel.
<PB N="320" REF="323"/>
That is all art! <HI>Il faut toujours peindre
en beau,</HI> whether in love or in politics.
The humane, the sensitive, the sublime
Vaurien (with such glorious titles have
you proudly decorated my name) if he
has any superior talent, it lies towards the
sarcastic, the caustic, and the malicious.</P>
<P>You now imagine me to be a villain—I am so; and with my national vanity,
I think I am a GREAT villain—I abhor
vulgarity, even in villainy.</P>
<P>But do not here tear this letter with
indignation. You must know all of
Vaurien ere you execrate him—and then
I dare you to hate him.</P>
<P>The moment I discovered that John∣son
was ruining all my schemes, I resolved
to deceive that stern and suspicious An∣glican.
Some little merit was in that de∣ception,
for it required my boldest ex∣ertion.
When I quitted you I arrested
Charles; I had lent him the money that
<PB N="321" REF="324"/>
I might command him at all times, well
knowing he could never repay me. I forged
the letter which Johnson received. All
Charles's letters were delivered to me.
The simple youth is at this moment moan∣ing
over the perfidy of modern friend∣ships,
and the coquetry of modern
loves.</P>
<P>I am not now rich, yet I can be ge∣nerous.
There are human sharks, or Lon∣don
cannibals, who would give money
for any legal instrument. A bond, you
may tell Charles, is no trifle; he signed
it as carelessly as if it had been a private
memorandum; it is a public one. With
this you receive it; take it yourself to
him in the Fleet. Let him receive his
freedom and his fortune from the hand
he adores. I wish it had been more, for
it was not money of mine. Let him pos∣sess
his Emily; yet I write the words with
a pang in my heart. Shew him this
<PB N="322" REF="325"/>
letter, and let it's secrets perish between
you. There assure him that his Emily is
a precious casket, whose gems have been
unrifled, although a robber had already
possessed a false key. Hundreds like
yourselves I have injured; many an honest
Charles I have met, but never in so soft
a form, a soul more chaste, and a mind
more exquisite.—Adorable Emily! you
are something more than woman, and yet
are all woman; something that the ima∣gination
gazes on with delight, yet awe;
taste is silent when it would describe you,
and in memory only you are viewed with
your singular excellence.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Will either of you forget VAURIEN?</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having sealed this letter, the Gaul took
his departure in a neutral vessel for Hol∣land,
and ere he reached it's shores al∣ready
meditated a new government for
<PB N="323" REF="326"/>
that ruined people; his speculations re∣ceived
considerable enlargement from se∣veral
patriots, and two or three philoso∣phers,
his <HI>compagnons de voiage,</HI> who with
him were taking the benefit of the Alien
Bill; patriots and philosophers, whom the
o'erpressed stomach of England had dis∣gorged
with a violent, but a salutary
effort.</P>
