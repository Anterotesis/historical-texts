<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<L>TOO long has Farce, neglecting Nature's Laws,</L>
<L>Debas'd the Stage, and wrong'd the Comic Cause:</L>
<L>To raise a Laugh has been her sole Pretence,</L>
<L>Tho' dearly purchas'd at the Price of Sense;</L>
<L>This Child of Folly gain'd Increase with Time;</L>
<L>Fit for the Place, succeeded <HI>Pantomime;</HI></L>
<L>Reviv'd her Honours, join'd her motley Band,</L>
<L>And Song, and low Conceit, o'er-ran the Land.</L>
<L>More gen'rous Views inform our Author's Breast,</L>
<L>From real Life his Characters are drest;</L>
<L>He seeks to trace the Passions of Mankind,</L>
<L>And while he spares the Person, paints the Mind.</L>
<L>In pleasing Contrast he attempts to show</L>
<L>The vap'ring Bully, and the frib'ling Beau,</L>
<L>Cowards alike, That full of Martial Airs,</L>
<L>And This as tender as the Silk he wears.</L>
<L>Proud to divert, not anxious for Renown,</L>
<L>Oft has the Bard essay'd to please the Town,</L>
<L>Your full Applause out-paid his little Art,</L>
<L>He boasts no Merit, but a grateful Heart;</L>
<L>Pronounce your Doom, he'll patiently submit,</L>
<L>Ye sovereign Judges of all Works of Wit!</L>
<L>To you the Ore is brought, a lifeless Mass,</L>
<L>You give the Stamp, and then the Coin may pass.</L>
<L>Now whether Judgment prompt you to forgive,</L>
<L>Whether you bid this trifling Offspring live,</L>
<L>Or with a Frown should send the sickly Thing,</L>
<L>To sleep whole Ages under Dulness' Wing;</L>
<L>To your known Candour we will always trust,</L>
<L>You never were, nor can you be unjust.</L>

<STAGE>SCENE, A STREET.</STAGE>
<STAGE>Enter Captain <HI>LOVEIT</HI> and <HI>PUFF.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS is the Place we were directed to; and now,
<HI>Puff,</HI> if I can get no Intelligence of her, what will
become of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And me too, Sir.—You must consider I am
a marry'd Man, and can't bear Fatigue as I have done.—But pray, Sir, why did you leave the Army so abruptly,
and not give me Time to fill my Knapsack with common
Necessaries? Half a Dozen Shirts, and your Regimentals,
are my whole Cargo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was wild to get away, and as soon as I obtain'd
my Leave of Absence, I thought every Moment an Age
till I return'd to the Place where I first saw this young-charming,
innocent, bewitching Creature—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>With fifteen thousand Pounds for her Fortune—Strong Motives, I must confess.—And now, Sir, as
you are pleas'd to say you must depend upon my Care and
Abilities in this Affair, I think I have a just Right to be
acquainted with the Particulars of your Passion, that I may
be the better enabled to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have 'em.—When I left the Uni∣versity,
which is now seven Months since, my Father, who
loves his Money better than his Son, and would not settle
a Farthing upon me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine did so by me, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Purchas'd me a Pair of Colours at my own Re∣quest;
but before I join'd the Regiment, which was going
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
abroad, I took a Ramble into the Country with a Fellow-C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>legian,
to see a Relation of his who liv'd in <HI>Berkshire.</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>—A Party of Pleasure, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>During a short Stay there, I came acquainted with
this young Creature; she was just come from the Boarding-School,
and tho' she had all the Simplicity of her Age and
the Country, yet it was mix'd with such sensible Vivacity,
that I took Fire at once—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was Tinder myself at your Age. But pray, Sir,
did you take Fire before you knew of her Fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before, upon my Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Folly and Constitution—But on, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was introduced to the Family by the Name of
<HI>Rhodophil,</HI> (for so my Companion and I had settled it;) at
the End of three Weeks I was oblig'd to attend the Call of
Honour in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Parting, to be sure, was Heart-breaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel it at this Instant.—We vow'd eternal Con∣stancy,
and I promis'd to take the first Opportunity of re∣turning
to her: I did so, but we found the House shut up,
and all the Information, you know, that we could get from
the neighbouring Cottage was, that Miss and her Aunt were
remov'd to Town, and liv'd somewhere near this Part of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now we are got to the Place of Action, pro∣pose
your Plan of Operation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father lives but in the next Street, so I must
decamp immediately for fear of Discoveries; you are not
known to be my Servant, so make what Enquiries you can
in the Neighbourhood, and I shall wait at the Inn for your
Intelligence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll patrol hercabouts, and examine all that pass;
but I've forgot the Word, Sir—Miss <HI>Biddy</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bellair—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young Lady of Wit, Beauty, and Fifteen thou∣sand
Pounds Fortune—but, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, <HI>Puff?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Honour pleases to consider that I had a
Wife in Town whom I left somewhat abruptly half a Year
ago, you'll think it, I believe, but decent, to make some
Enquiry after her first; to be sure it would be some small
Consolation to me to know whether the poor Woman is li∣ving,
or has made away with herself, or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythec don't distract me; a Moment's Delay is
of the utmost Consequence; I must insist upon an imme∣diate
Compliance with my Commands.</P>
<STAGE>(Exit <HI>Captain.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil's in these fiery young Fellows! they
think of no body's Wants but their own. He does not
consider that I am Flesh and Blood as well as himself. How∣ever
I may kill two Birds at once; for I shan't be surpriz'd
if I meet my Lady walking the Streets—But who have
we here? Sure I should know that Face.</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Jasper</HI> from a House.</STAGE>
<P>Who's that? my old Acquaintance, <HI>Jasper!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, <HI>Puff!</HI> are you here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Friend! <STAGE>[Kisses him.]</STAGE> Well, and how
<HI>Jasper,</HI> still easy and happy! <HI>Toujours le meme!</HI>—What
Intrigues now? What Girls have you ruin'd, and what
Cuckolds made, since you and I us'd to beat up together, Eh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Business has been very brisk during the
War; Men are scarce, you know; not that I can say I
ever wanted Amusement in the worst of Times.—But
harkye. <HI>Puff</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a Word aloud, I am <HI>incognito.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Faith, I should not have known you, if
you had not spoke first; you seem to be a little <HI>dishabille</HI>
too, as well as <HI>incognito.</HI> Whom do you honour with your
Service now? Are you from the Wars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Piping hot, I assure you; Fire and Smoke will tar∣nish;
a Man that will go into such Service as I have been
in, will find his Clothes the worse for wear, take my Word
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
for it: But how is it with you, Friend <HI>Jasper</HI>? What,
you still serve, I see? You live at that House, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't absolutely live, but I am most of my
Time there; I have within these two Months enter'd into
the Service of an old Gentleman, who hired a reputable
Servant, and dress'd him as you see, because he has taken
it into his Head to fall in Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>False Appetite and second Childhood! But pr'y∣thee,
what's the Object of his Passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>No less than a Virgin of Sixteen, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the toothless old Dotard!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he mumbles and plays with her till his
Mouth waters; then he chuckles till he cries, and calls it
his <HI>Bid,</HI> and his <HI>Bidsy,</HI> and is so foolishly fond—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Bidsy!</HI> What's that?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Her Name is <HI>Biddy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Biddy!</HI> What, Miss <HI>Biddy Bellair</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>—The same—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no Luck, to be sure. <STAGE>[Aside.]</STAGE>—Oh!
I have heard of her; she's of a pretty good Family, and
has some Fortune, I know. But are things settled? Is the
Marriage fixed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not absolutely; the Girl, I believe, detests
him; but her Aunt, a very good prudent old Lady, has
given her Consent, if he can gain her Niece's; how it will
end I can't tell—but I am hot upon't myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>—The Devil! not Marriage, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not yet determined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is the Lady, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Maid in the same Family, a Woman of Ho∣nour,
I assure you; She has one Husband already, a scoun∣drel
sort of a Fellow that has run away from her, and list∣ed
for a Soldier; so, towards the End of the Campaign, she
hopes to have a Certificate he's knock'd o' th' Head; if not,
I suppose, we shall settle Matters another way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, speed the Plough.—But harkye, consum∣mate
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
without the Certificate if you can—keep your
Neck out of the Collar—do—I have wore it these two
Years, and damnably gall'd I am.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take your Advice; but I must run away to
my Master, who will be impatient for an Answer to his
Message which I have just deliver'd to the young Lady; so,
dear Mr. <HI>Puff,</HI> I am your most obedient humble Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I must to our Agent's for my Arrears: If
you have an Hour to spare, you'll hear of me at <HI>George</HI>'s
or the <HI>Tilt-Yard</HI>—<HI>Au Revoir,</HI> as we say abroad.
<STAGE>[Exit <HI>Jasper.</HI>]</STAGE> Thus we are as civil and as false as our Bet∣ters;
<HI>Jasper</HI> and I were always the <HI>Beau Monde</HI> exactly;
we ever hated one another heartily, yet always kiss, and
shake Hands—But now to my Master, with a Head full
of News, and a Heart full of Joy!</P>
<STAGE>[Going starts.</STAGE>
<L>Angels, and Ministers of Grace, defend me!</L>
<P>It can't be! by Heavens, it is, that fretful Porcupine, my
Wife! I can't stand it; what shall I do? I'll try to avoid
her.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Tag.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be he! I'll swear to the Rogue at a Mile's
distance; he either has not seen me, or wont know me;
if I can keep my Temper I'll try him farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sweat—I tremble—She comes upon me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, good Sir, If I may be so bold—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing for you, good Woman, don't
trouble me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Honour pleases to look this way—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Kingdom is over-run with Beggars; I suppose
the last I gave to has sent this: but I have no more loose
Silver about me; so pr'ythee, Woman, don't disturb me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can hold no longer; oh you Villain, you! Where
have you been, Scoundrel! Do you know me now Varlet?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazement! what, my own dear <HI>Tag!</HI> Come
to my Arms, and let me press you to my Heart, that pants
for thee, and only thee, my true and lawful Wife.—Now
my Stars have over-paid me for the Fatigue and Dangers of
the Field; I have wander'd about like <HI>Achilles</HI> in search of
faithful <HI>Penelope,</HI> and the Gods have brought me to this
happy Spot.</P>
<STAGE>[Embraces her.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Fellow's crack'd for certain! Leave your bom∣bastick
Stuff, and tell me, Rascal, why you left me, and
where you have been these six Months, heh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll reserve my Adventures for our happy Win∣ter
Evenings—I shall only tell you now, that my Heart
beats so strong in my Country's Cause, and being instigated
either by Honour or the Devil, (I cannot tell which) I set
out for <HI>Flanders,</HI> to gather Lawrels, and lay 'em at thy Feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>You left me to starve, Villain, and beg my Bread,
you did so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Puff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left you too hastily I must confess, and often has
my Conscience flung me for it.—I am got into an Offi∣cer's
Service, have been in several Actions, gain'd some
Credit by my Behaviour, and am now return'd with my
Master, to indulge the gender Passions.</P>
</SP>

<P>Don't think to fob me off with this nonsensical

for an Inundation of Joy! My Master is in
love with your Miss <HI>Biddy</HI> over Head and Ears, and she
with him: I know she is courted by some old Fumbler,
and her Aunt is not against the Match; but now we are
come the Town will be reliev'd, and the Governor brought
over; in plain <HI>English,</HI> our Fortune is made; my Master

<P>Say no more, the Dice are thrown, Doublets for

tell her <HI>Rhodophil! Rhodophil!</HI> will be with her immediate∣ly;
then if her Blood does not mount to her Face like
Quicksilver in a Weather-glass, and point to extreme hot,
believe the whole a Lye, and your Husband no Politician.</P>

<P>This is news, indeed! I have had the Place but

<P>Innocent! ne'er trust to that, Madam; I was in∣nocent
myself once, but <HI>Live and Learn</HI> is an old Saying,
and a true one:—I believe, Madam, no Body is more
innocent than yourself, and a good Maid you are to be sure

<HI>fancy it</HI> I warrant you.</P>

<P>I should prefer a large Jointure to a small one,

turn'd of Sixteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a ticklish Age, Madam! I have observ'd
she does not eat, nor she does not sleep; she sighs, and she
cries, and she loves Moon-light; these, I take it, are very
strong Symptoms.</P>

<P>Chastity! Never trust to that, Madam; get her a
Husband that's fit for her, and I'll be bound for her Virtue;

for my own.</P>

<P>Well, <HI>Tag,</HI> the Child shall never have reason to

the best Millener, where they sell the best Tea, and which

<P>Every thing goes on to our Wish, Sir; I just
now had a second Conference with my old Lady, and
she was so convinced by my Arguments, that she return'd
instantly to the Lawyer to forbid the drawing out of a∣ny
Writings at all, and she is determin'd never to
thwart Miss's Inclinations, and left it to us to give the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy,</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very much alarm'd for fear my two Gal∣lants
should come in upon us unawares; we should have
had sad work if they had: I find I love <HI>Rhodophil</HI> vast∣ly,
for tho' my other Sparks flatter me more, I can't a∣bide
the thoughts of 'em now—I have Business upon
my Hands enough to turn my little Head, but egad my
Heart's good, and a Fig for Dangers—let me see,
what shall I do with my two Gallants? I must, at least,
part with 'em decently; suppose I set 'em together by
the Ears?—The luckiest thought in the World! For if
if they won't quarrel (as I believe they won't) I can
break with them for Cowards, and very justly dismiss
'em my Service; and if they will fight, and one of 'em
should be kill'd, the other will certainly be hang'd, or
run away, and so I shall very handsomely get rid of both.—I
am glad I have settled it so purely.</P>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>Tag.</HI></STAGE>
<P>Well, <HI>Tag,</HI> are they safe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I think so, the Door's double lock'd, and I
have the Key in my Pocket.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's pure; but have you given 'em any thing
to divert 'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have given the Captain one of your old Gloves
to mumble, but my <HI>Strephon</HI> is diverting himself with
the more substantial Comforts of a cold Ven'son Pasty.</P>

</SP>

<P>If Mr. <HI>Fribble</HI> comes first, I'll clap him up into

of making some critical Remarks upon our Pastry
and Sweet-meats.</P>
</SP>

<P>When one of 'em comes, do you go and watch
for the other, and as soon as you see him, run in to
us, and pretend it is my Aunt, and so we shall have an
Excuse to lock him up till we want him.</P>

<P>Miss <HI>Biddy</HI> your Slave—I hope I have not
come upon you abruptly; I should have waited upon

Roses, and Lilly of the Valley Water.</P>

<P>I thank you, Sir, but my Lips are generally
red, and, when they an't, I bite 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bite my own, sometimes, to pout 'em a little,
but this will give them a Softness, Colour, and an agree∣able
<HI>Moister.</HI>—Thus let me make an humble Offering
at that Shrine, where I have already sacrific'd my Heart.</P>
<STAGE>[Kneels and gives the Pot.</STAGE>

<P>But to return to my Accident, and the Reason
why my Hand is in this Condition—I beg you'll excuse

mere Necessity could have forc'd me to appear thus

<P>You are vastly good indeed,—thus it was.—Hem!—You must know, Miss, there is not
an Animal in the Creation I have so great an Aversion
to, as those Hackney-coach Fellows—As I was
coming out of my Lodgings,—Says one of 'em
to me, <HI>Would your Honour heve a Coach</HI>?—No, Man,
said I, not now (with all the Civility imaginable)—<HI>I'll carry you and your Doll too,</HI> (says he) <HI>Miss</HI> Margery
<HI>for the same Price.</HI>—Upon which the masculine
Beasts about us fell a laughing; then I turn'd round in
a great Passion, curse me, (says I) Fellow, but I'll
trounce thee.—And, as I was holding out my Hand in
a threatning <HI>Poster,</HI>—thus;—he makes a Cut at
me with his Whip, and striking me over the Nail of my
little Finger, it gave me such exquisite <HI>Torter</HI> that I
fainted away; and, while I was in this Condition, the
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
Mob pick'd my Pocket of my Purse, my Scissars, my
<HI>Mocoa</HI> Smelling-Bottle, and my Huswife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall laugh in his Face. <STAGE>(Aside.) </STAGE> I am afraid
you are in great Pain; pray sit down, Mr. <HI>Fribble,</HI> but
I hope your Hand is in no Danger.</P>
<STAGE>[They sit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least, Maam; pray don't be appre∣hensive—A
Milk-poultice, and a gentle Sweat to
Night, with a little Manna in the Morning, I am confi∣dent
will relieve me entirely.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Mr. <HI>Fribble,</HI> do you make use of a
Huswife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't do without it, Maam; there is a Club
of us, all young Batchelors, the sweetest Society in the
World; and we meet three times a Week at each o∣thers
Lodgings, where we drink Tea, hear the Chat of
the Day, invent Fashions for the Ladies, make Models
of 'em, and cut out Patterns in Paper. We were the
first Inventors of Knotting, and this Fringe is the origi∣nal
Produce and joint Labour of our little Community.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who are your pretty Set, pray?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a sweet Collection of happy Creatures!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed and so we are, Miss,—But a pro∣digious
<HI>Fracas</HI> disconcerted us some time ago at <HI>Billy
Dimple</HI>'s—three drunken naughty Women of the
Town burst into our Club-room, curst us all, threw
down the China, broke six Looking-glasses, scalded us
with the Slop-Bason, and <HI>scrat</HI> poor <HI>Phil Whiffle</HI>'s
Cheek in such a manner, that he has kept his Bed these
three Weeks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Mr. <HI>Fribble,</HI> I think all our Sex have
great Reason to be angry; for if you are so happy now
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
you are Batchelors, the Ladies may wish and sigh to
very little purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Mr. <HI>Fribble,</HI> now you have gone so far,
don't think me impudent if I long to know how you
intend to use the Lady who shall be honour'd with
your Affections?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not as most other Wives are us'd, I assure you;

<P>My Affection to this Lady.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Affection, Puppy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Love, Sir, has been long and mutual; what
Accidents have happen'd since my going abroad, and her
leaving the Country, and how I have most unaccountably
met you here, I am a Stranger to; but whatever Appear∣ances
may be, I still am, and ever was, your dutiful Son.</P>

<P>Dutiful, Sirrah! Have you not rival'd your
Father?</P>

<P>No, Sir, you have rival'd me; my Claim must
be prior to yours.</P>

<P>Indeed, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> he can shew the best Title to
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jasper.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, Sir, the young Gentleman speaks well, and
as the Fortune will not go out of the Family, I would ad∣vise
you to drop your Resentment, be reconcil'd to your
Son, and relinquish the Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, with all my Heart—Look ye, Son,
I give you up the Girl, she's too much for me, I confess;—And
take my Word, <HI>Bob,</HI> you'll catch a <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Biddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> I'm not the Person you
take me for; if I have us'd you any ways ill, 'twas for
your Son's sake, who had my Promise and Inclinations be∣fore
you; and tho' I believe I should have made you a most
uncomfortable Wife, I'll be the best Daughter to you in
the World; and if you stand in need of a Lady, my Aunt
is disengag'd, and is the best Nurse—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I thank you, Child; you have so
turn'd my Stomach to Marriage, I have no Appetite left.—<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
But where is this Aunt? Won't she stop your Proceedings,
think you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tag.</SPEAKER>
<P>She's now at her Lawyer's, Sir, and if you please
to go with the young Couple, and give your Approbation,
I'll answer for my old Lady's Consent.</P>

<P>Come, come, <HI>Bob,</HI> you are but an Ensign, don't
impose on the Girl neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had the good Fortune, Sir, to please my Royal
General by my Behaviour in a small Action with the Ene∣my,
and he gave me a Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Bob,</HI> I wish you Joy! This is News indeed!
And when we celebrate your Wedding, Son, I'll drink a
half Pint Bumper myself to your Benefactor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he deserves it, Sir; such a General, by his
Example and Justice, animates us to Deeds of Glory, and
