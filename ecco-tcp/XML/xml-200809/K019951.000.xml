<P>QUEEN MARY TO KING WILLIAM, DURING HIS CAMPAIGN IN IRELAND, 1690.</P>
<P>A POETICAL EPISTLE.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<PB REF="16"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following Poem was written several years ago, and arose from the recent publication of the Queen's original and most interesing letters, which Sir John Dalrymple inserted in the Appendix to his Memoirs of Great Britain. The number of these letters amounts to thirty-seven; they exhibit the character of this admirable woman in the most affecting point of view, and fully justify all the praise that has been given to the tenderness of her heart and the dignity of her mind. The Poem, which is but a kind of echo to her genuine sen∣timents, had been thrown aside, with many other verses which the author has kept in privacy, from the fear of trespassing too frequently on the indulgence of the public; but he has been induced to print it with the preceding Stanzas, from the idea that it may find favour in the sight of those who love to dwell, at this particular season, on the great characters which it attempts to delineate.</P>

<HEAD>QUEEN MARY TO KING WILLIAM.</HEAD>
<L>Once more reliev'd, by midnight's welcome hour,</L>
<L>From all the busy train of anxious power,</L>
<L>My soul, O WILLIAM! from their bondage free,</L>
<L>Joys in that freedom, and is flown to thee;</L>
<L>Like the poor Martyr in religion's cause,</L>
<L>Who, if the hand of Persecution pause,</L>
<L>With Love devout, with warmth of Prayer intense,</L>
<L>Strains every thought, and each recovering sense,</L>
<L>Humbly to ask new spirit from his God,</L>
<L>To bear each future pang of torture's rod:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="18"/>To thee I bend, my succour and my pride,</L>
<L>Whose love sustains me, and whose counsels guide.</L>
<L>While War, that turns from hence his tide of blood,</L>
<L>Bears thy great spirit on his swelling flood,</L>
<L>Eager to end, regardless of thy life,</L>
<L>The wasting storm of sanguinary strife;</L>
<L>While compass'd round with growing fears I stand,</L>
<L>The trembling Guardian of this troubled land;</L>
<L>While robb'd of thee, whose animating sight</L>
<L>Turns doubt to joy, and terror to delight,</L>
<L>I feel, instead of thy protecting care,</L>
<L>Fear for thy life—the worst of fears to bear—</L>
<L>O! may thy letters, Ministers of Peace,</L>
<L>Bid my vain terror for thy safety cease;</L>
<L>O! let them frequent, fraught with love, impart</L>
<L>Thy noble spirit to this weaker heart,</L>
<L>Which yet, too conscious of its failing power,</L>
<L>Strains every nerve, in each oppressive hour,</L>
<L>To keep thy precious estimation still;</L>
<L>Eager to find and happy to fulfil,</L>
<L>(Since from that source alone my pleasures spring)</L>
<L>The dearest wishes of my distant King.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="19"/>In these hard scenes, O! give me to rejoice</L>
<L>In the kind sanction of thy partial voice;</L>
<L>O! grant my soul its honest pride to raise,</L>
<L>On the strong basis of my WILLIAM's praise:</L>
<L>From that alone my little strength I draw,</L>
<L>Thy smile my glory, and thy will my law.</L>
<L>Think how this bosom at thy signet glows,</L>
<L>Which I in agony of haste unclose!</L>
<L>How to thy letter my fond eyes I glue,</L>
<L>Till tears of transport intercept their view!</L>
<L>Then to my heart those vital lines are prest,</L>

<L>When the sky darkens, when the storm descends;</L>
<L>When each great effort of the crew is crost,</L>

<L>Yet, yet, I mount these cruel waves above,</L>
<L>Buoy'd up by duty and superior love;</L>
<L>Tho' icy terror freeze my female heart,</L>
<L>Thy Consort yet sustains her trying part;</L>
<L>Her features yet her Country's fears beguile,</L>
<L>Cast o'er their doubts a confidential smile,</L>

<L>Dear, native Britain, noble, generous Land,</L>
<L>Proud of that rescue which thy virtue plann'd;</L>
<L>As yet but half redeem'd, I mourn thy doom,</L>
<L>To see thy glories shaken in their bloom;</L>
<L>To see proud France with fatal power suspend</L>
<L>Thy great redemption and its peaceful end;</L>
<L>While He, whose saving hand thy laws proclaim,</L>
<L>(Whose sight is safety, whose protection fame)</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21"/>By distant slaughter from thy shores debarr'd,</L>
<L>Must leave thy honour to so weak a guard;</L>

<L>And break his baleful spells by naming Thee:</L>
<L>Those scenes, more dreadful, I recall to view</L>
<L>In which my Hero's infant glory grew,</L>
<L>When trembling Holland first with transport saw</L>
<L>The stern atchievments of her young NASSAU:</L>
<L>I see the moment when her prostrate shore</L>
<L>Heard, all in vain, her guardian waters roar,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22"/>Above those bulwarks saw her fate advance,</L>
<L>Her shame, her ruin, in the host of France;</L>
<L>When all her sons would o'er th' Atlantic fly,</L>
<L>And bear their Freedom to a brighter sky,</L>
<L>Leaving those seats, their fathers form'd of yore,</L>
<L>In ocean buried, and their name no more:</L>
<L>When thus of every human aid bereft,</L>
<L>E'en then thy Valour said—it still was left,</L>
<L>To bid despotic Desolation strike,</L>
<L>And fall with Freedom on her latest dyke!</L>
<L>E'en then I see Thee, undismay'd, oppose</L>
<L>The rising deluge of thy Country's foes,</L>
<L>Oppression's torrent stem with nobler force,</L>
<L>And bid her flood roll backward to its source;</L>
<L>See rescued millions on thy triumph wait,</L>
<L>And hail thee Saviour of a sinking state!</L>
<L>While this bright image of thy rising fame</L>
<L>Warms my fond heart, and animates my frame,</L>
<L>My melting soul thus pours, with warmth like thine,</L>
<L>Its adorations to the Throne Divine:—</L>
<L>Thou God of Justice, whose sustaining power</L>

<L>Unhappy England! who hast mourn'd in vain,</L>
<L>Thy coast dishonour'd by this naval stain;</L>
<L>May thy white cliffs, that tinge the silv'ry flood,</L>
<L>Behold the stain effac'd in Gallic blood!</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="25"/>And thou, proud vessel of stupendous mould,</L>
<L>Emblazing ocean with thy breadth of gold,</L>
<L>Thou France's naval pride, Imperial Sun,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of Tourville's ship, at that time the finest in the world.</NOTE></L>
<L>Swift o'er thy shrouds may flames of vengeance run!</L>
<L>Thy boasted bulk may English thunders rend,</L>
<L>And thy pale streamers to the deep descend!</L>
<L>May Britons see, while shouts of joy they raise,</L>
<L>Thy gorgeous fabric in their lightnings blaze;</L>
<L>And, blazing, shed on their illumin'd shore,</L>
<L>Glories more bright than it eclips'd before!</L>
<L>My bosom thus with love of England fraught,</L>
<L>My spirits mount in that ennobling thought;</L>
<L>Tho' a just God may check our erring pride,</L>
<L>I still, O WILLIAM! in his care confide:</L>
<L>Life, safety, peace, from this idea springs,</L>
<L>That thou art Soldier to the King of Kings;</L>
<L>That thy great actions make his mercies known,</L>
<L>Thy fame his glory, and thy cause his own!—</L>
<L>But should that God, a guilty world to awe,</L>
<L>His chosen Warrior from its aid withdraw;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="26"/>Should He—But hence, distracting image! hence,</L>
<L>Nor shed thy poison on my wounded sense.</L>
<L>Yet in these minutes, that so slowly roll,</L>
<L>When expectation fills the busy soul,</L>
<L>And thinks each moment, with our King, to share</L>
<L>Conquest or ruin, triumph or despair,</L>
<L>Impatient Doubt, with stronger Fear combin'd,</L>
<L>Strikes from its center the unbalanc'd mind;</L>
<L>Yet e'en these hours I labour to beguile,</L>
<L>To make Suspence's frozen features smile,</L>
<L>And from disquietude my heart to free,</L>
<L>By thus unfolding all that heart to thee.</L>
<L>He comes! thy Courier!—on affection's wing</L>
<L>I fly to catch the tidings of my King!—</L>
<L>O joy! O bounteous Heaven! O blessed hour!</L>
<L>Delight that drowns expression's feeble power!—</L>
<L>Great God of Battles! whose high will has shed</L>
<L>This signal glory round my Hero's head,</L>
<L>O! while thy praise, in hymns of triumph sung,</L>
<L>Fills the glad earth, forgive my faltering tongue,</L>
<L>Survey my soul, accept its silent prayer,</L>
<L>And see thy mercies all engraven there!—</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="27"/>And thou, my Lord, my Life, dear Victor, say,</L>
<L>What words my transport can to thee convey:</L>
<L>I write, but tears th' imperfect line destroy,</L>
<L>And every thought dissolves in floods of joy!</L>
<L>What aweful scenes, what images arise,</L>
<L>In swift succession to my wond'ring eyes!</L>
<L>Thy wound now shakes my shudd'ring heart with fear,</L>
<L>Thy shouts of victory now strike my ear;</L>
<L>I see afflicted Angels staunch thy blood,</L>
<L>I see thee plunge in Boyne's immortal flood,</L>
<L>I see thee lift thy leading sword on high,</L>
<L>The cruel sons of persecution fly;</L>
<L>I see the rout;—but, in that flying band,</L>
<L>One sacred head—O! stretch thy saving hand!</L>
<L>O! for thy MARY's sake, in mercy spare!—</L>
<L>Forgive this vain unnecessary prayer,</L>
<L>The weakness of that heart with pity see,</L>
<L>Which recommends Humanity to thee:</L>
<L>As well might Man, proud offspring of the dust,</L>
<L>Enjoin the God of Justice to be just;</L>
<L>For O! my WILLIAM! in thy godlike breast</L>
<L>Celestial Mercy is a constant guest:</L>
<L><PB N="26" REF="28"/>No vain, ambitious, fanguinary pride,</L>
<L>No bigot fury is thy frantic guide;</L>
<L>Heaven's purest law, and Man's most sacred right,</L>
<L>Lead thy mild spirit to the wasting fight:</L>
<L>Like some pure Seraph, who, by Heaven enjoin'd</L>
<L>To search, to punish, to correct mankind,</L>
<L>With sweet reluctance wields his flaming blade,</L>
<L>With pity views the waste by Justice made;</L>
<L>And, pleas'd the voice of Penitence to hear,</L>
<L>Drops on each wound a salutary tear:</L>
<L>Such, in the storm of war, thy virtues shine;</L>
<L>The welfare of the world thy great design.</L>
<L>While Mercy bids admiring nations own,</L>
<L>Thy sword her weapon, and thy heart her throne,</L>
<L>My love need only to thy thought commend</L>
<L>One dearer life, which, mighty God! defend;</L>
<L>For, of the many lives that ask my prayer,</L>
<L>None but thy own will want thy constant care:</L>
<L>Learn from thy wound—Alas! its terrors still</L>
<L>Thro' Triumph's glowing bosom strike their chill.</L>
<L>From thee, protecting Heaven! this boon I crave—</L>
<L>From one, the worst of woes, thy servant save;</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="29"/>Ne'er let me see, condemn'd to lose my all,</L>
<L>The Pillar of the Public Safety fall;</L>
<L>Condemn'd to weep my guardian spirit flown,</L>
<L>And wander thro' an empty world alone.</L>
<L>Sooner, much sooner, let some kind disease</L>
<L>This yielding frame with baleful fury seize;</L>
<L>These terms will reconcile my struggling breath</L>
<L>To the dread summons of impending death:</L>
<L>Perchance, when all my latest pangs have ceas'd,</L>
<L>When this soft spirit is from earth releas'd,</L>
<L>Perchance thy Guardian Angel may resign</L>
<L>The life of WILLIAM to a love like mine;</L>
<L>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kindly deign so dear a charge to share,</L>
<L>And own I watch thee with a fonder care.</L>
<L>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shou'd th' all-wise, all-gracious God decree</L>
<L>To rend, by early death, this frame from thee,</L>
<L>To early death this consolation give,</L>
<L>Say that I still shall in thy memory live;</L>
<L>Nor there, O WILLIAM! not e'en there alone,</L>
<L>O! bid my fondness, like thy fame, be known;</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="30"/>Let distant ages—(if not sunk in shame,</L>
<L>Ages most distant must revere thy name)—</L>
<L>Let distant ages, by thy virtue free,</L>
<L>My love engrafted on thy glory see,</L>
<L>Preserv'd from Time and Envy's hostile shock,</L>
<L>To bloom immortal on that sacred stock.</L>
<L>But Heaven yet seems indulgent to bestow</L>
<L>A lasting union on our loves below;</L>
<L>Our promis'd meeting of dear-bought delight</L>
<L>Fills my fond soul, and dawns upon my sight;</L>
<L>Thy foes dispers'd, thy fainting friends reliev'd,</L>
<L>All the great duties of thy sword atchiev'd,</L>
<L>Thou hast no cause in distant realms to stay,</L>
<L>And wound expecting fondness by delay:</L>
<L>Come then, blest Victor! come, our dear Defence!</L>
<L>While strong impatience strains our aching sense,</L>
<L>Soon let me clasp, in thy embraces blest,</L>
<L>My glorious Warrior to my glowing breast!</L>
<L>Hang on thy lips, and with delight explore</L>
<L>Thy great atchievments on Ierne's shore!</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="31"/>Come, thou prime care of the propitious Sky!</L>
<L>Hither on Victory's rapid pinions fly!</L>
<L>Fly to these arms! and, while from them disjoin'd,</L>
<L>Still let this truth be present to thy mind—</L>
<L>Th' all-searching Spirit in no heart can see,</L>
<L>A love surpassing what I bear to thee.</L>
