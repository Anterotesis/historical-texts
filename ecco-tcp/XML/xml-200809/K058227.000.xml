<P>THE Author thinks he should be deficient in duty, if he did not thus warmly express his gratitude to his friends for their kind patronage, and to the public, for the very favourable recep∣tion the piece met with in representation. Relying upon a continuation of their good-nature, he now ventures to submit it to their perusal; humbly hoping they will consider it as the <HI>first</HI> essay of one whose utmost ambition was to amuse without of∣fending.</P>

<L>DON'T be alarm'd my friend! you need not be in fear,</L>
<L>None but good-natur'd folks I'm positive are here.</L>
<STAGE>[Coming forward to the audience.]</STAGE>
<L>To plead a brother's cause, who trembling stands behind,</L>
<L>A volunteer I come—and beg you will be kind</L>
<L>To this his first begotten—shew your fost'ring care,</L>
<L>And let his tender bantling in your favours share.</L>
<L>"In art's perfection is the growth of years,</L>
<L>"The bud must open, ere the flower appears."</L>
<L>Each litele fault or blemish pass regardless by,</L>
<L>But mark each glimpse of merit with approving eye.</L>
<L>Tho' yet a raw unpractis'd novice he appear,</L>
<L>Let but your gen'rous plaudits dissipate his fear,</L>
<L>To bolder heigths hereafter he may wing his flight,</L>
<L>And give you then much greater pleasure and delight:</L>
<L>For applause you all know's the life of endeavour,</L>
<L>Without it in vain is our study and labour.</L>
<L>To each critic I sue—on each fair one rely,</L>
<L>Many looks of indulgence methinks I espy.</L>
<L>As a sketch of his plan—his attempt is to shew</L>
<L>The nice Fop of the age, and the Libertine too,</L>
<L>Their vices and follies hold up to derision,</L>
<L>That feeling its force they may shew their contrition.</L>
<L>Virtue and beauty's charms he likewise sets to view,</L>
<L>All-powerful charms, such as shou'd ev'ry heart subdue.</L>
<L>From nature's wide and ample field his plan he draws,</L>
<L>And hopes to please you all by her unerring laws.</L>
<L>Then with candour attend—let no prejudice rise,</L>
<L>But shew yourselves pleas'd both with hands and with eyes,</L>

<L>WHEN Folly, with dame Fashion's forces join'd,</L>

<L>Oft has <HI>Thalia,</HI> fir'd with generous rage,</L>
<L>Lash'd the proud tyrants on th' instructive Stage,</L>
<L>Unmask'd their every art, then headlong hurl'd</L>
<L>From their high thrones those sovereigns of our world;</L>
<L>Bid injur'd Reason her lost rights again</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Come, what's the real occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>To display my taste and elegance, and I think this will give a convincing proof of both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Upon my soul you make such large advances to the feminine gender, that in a little time 'twill be difficult to tell to which sex you belong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wou'd have it so—I do it to be distin∣guished from the Tramontane—but I want to know where you have been?—I have hunted all the public places in London for you, without success; and I thought, if alive, I must have met you at one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You find you are mistaken then—I can readily live without a continual round of dissipation, though to you it may be impossible—Your existence depends upon dress and fashion—I despise both—Even my pleasures are different from yours—I am wholly devoted to the charms of beauty, you, to those hourly discovered by your looking-glass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, which are most harmless to man∣kind? I who am amused by dress, and a passion for myself, or you, who, for a trifling gratification,
<PB N="4" REF="19"/>are continually studying the ruin of every girl hand∣some enough to attract your Notice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Jack, you have not spirit enough to make an attack upon any female, either in an ho∣nourable, or any other manner—Now, the warmth of my constitution hurries me on to pleasures which you, tasteless mortals, never dream of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And often exposes you to very disagreeable consequences—Witness Miss Standfield.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, it sometimes happens so—but then I have courage to support myself under those diffi∣culties—And now you mention her, I own she was a girl I lov'd more than I thought the levity of my na∣ture cou'd admit of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you gave a conspicuous proof of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did—Her father, Major Standfield, was my particular friend; a man I had an un∣common regard for—therefore I avoided meeting him afterwards, lest some unlucky chance shou'd lodge my sword in his bosom—That you'll allow was honourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! humane and honourable to the highest degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, after the many proofs of my skill in the sword, I could have no reason to doubt its success with an old man, so, to be entirely out of harm's way, I took that opportunity of gratifying my desire in visiting the principal courts of Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>To which accident I was indebted for the pleasure of your company home from Naples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You was—During near five years resi∣dence abroad, I have never even heard from the poor girl, though, upon my soul, I have often severe∣ly felt for the unhappy situation I left her in—which plainly proves that I am not destitute of com∣passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a miracle of tenderness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>In foreign climes, as well as at home, I was confirm'd in my favourite principle, that
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>Women, if rightly attack'd, are sure to yield—I found you indeed an altered fellow, without either life or soul, nor cou'd my utmost endeavours arouse you—I wanted you to be a man of spirit; your ambition was to appear a first-rate Macaroni; you are returned fully qualified, and determined, I see, to shew the world what a contemptible creature an Englishman dwindles into, when he adopts the follies and vices of other nations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike me speechless, George! if you are not devilish severe—but, <HI>par late liber amente</HI>—I can't take any thing ill you say—May ill-breeding be my portion, if I don't pity your want of taste!—Let me tell you, my Lord, 'tis we who enjoy all the real plea∣sures of life, without any of its inconveniences—Love, I grant you, is not admitted into our system. We look upon it, at best, as a passion attended with so many disagreeable sensations, that it is not worth the pursuit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a fellow, for a girl of my sister's sense, to be united to!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true we do amuse ourselves sometimes with the ladies—imitate their manners—but care∣fully avoid all serious connection with them—Oh. Lord! what a horrid thing love must be!—To take off all attention from ourselves, and study to be what you call manly, brave, noble, and generous, in order to appear amiable in the eyes of the fair—Ha! ha! ha!—No, no, by all that's ridiculous, it will never do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then has a pretty girl no influence on thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in the least—May the sun freckle me if she has! but as she regards my dress and conver∣sation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No you do not wish to make a conquest of one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, by all that's fashionable! Hearkee, Promise, do you think if I loved a girl, that I cou'd
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>devote the time I do to the more essential business of decorating my person?—Look at me well, and an∣swer truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—that wou'd then be one of your least cares.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, may my cloaths mis-fit me! if I wou'd forego that happiness to possess all the graces the poets ever assembled in women!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll except my sister—How do you in∣tend to manage in that affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you puzzle me—but, when I know myself, I'll tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you seen her since you came home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I design it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take care, or you'll lose her—She's followed now by a brisker lover—But that I find wou'd be no misfortune to you—Don't you think our old dads were rather foolish when they signed that con∣tract, which obliges you to marry each other, or for∣feit thirty thousand pounds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid I shall suffer by their folly—But who is the happy man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tom Clement, a worthy young fellow of family and fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose not—Come, I'll introduce you to two of the loveliest angelic creatures the sun ever shone upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can convince me the sun shines up∣on any one I love better than myself, you may; if not, excuse me—Pray, who are these lovely ange∣lic creatures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are two of the fairest of Eve's daughters, whom I have just decoyed up to town, upon the old scheme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I may conclude it was about them you were so busily employ'd during your late invi∣sibility?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right—Not having visited my father's eslate in the wilds of Yorkshire since my return from travel, I resolv'd upon an excursion thither—The romantic beauty of the country pleased me much, presenting an agreeable contrast to the place I had just left—On Sunday, knowing the church to be the only spot where I might pick and chuse the rustics to advantage, I resolved not to miss the op∣portunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, my Lord, have you so little re∣ligion in you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much the same as yourself in that re∣spect, my boy—There is only this difference, you cannot think, I will not—But how shall I express the astonishment which seized me upon beholding, amongst many of homely garb and feature, two of the sweetest girls nature ever formed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, so!—Fresh Game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>On enquiry, I found they were daughters to an old gentleman, whom a variety of misfortunes had drove to this part of the world as an asylum—The eldest was handsome enough to justify the dis∣guises of Jove had he been on earth—But never was modesty, beauty, and native elegance so happily united as in the youngest—I am not adamant at any time, here I took fire in an instant—As soon as ser∣vice was over, which I thought the longest ever per∣formed, I introduced myself to the father and his two sylvan deities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a laconic method, by all that's mo∣dest!—Well, what success?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you need not ask that at any time—I seldom fail, even when circumstances are against me, much less when considered as the only son of the Earl of Witton, and heir to the estate many miles round about me—The father received me with the greatest respect; the daughters with a bewitching innocent diffidence, which gave fresh lustre to their encreasing charms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet those very charms you are labouring to destroy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't interrupt me—I soon found that nothing was to be done amongst those peaceful wilds—London was the only place where I cou'd manage them to my wish—They never had been there, and I gloried in being their introducer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shou'd have thought it a hard matter to have enticed them hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, quite easy to me—A few days ingra∣tiated me into the old gentleman's favour—Replete with every virtue which can warm the human heart, his honest unsuspecting mind has not an idea of de∣ceit—Indeed, if he had, my plan was laid so well, he cou'd hardly have suspected it—Many years had he pass'd in this unfrequented vale, where he intomb'd one of the best of wives—Since her decease, his chief care has been the education of these two darling daughters—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which for the future you are willing to ease him the trouble of—Very charitable, upon my word, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>To own a truth to you, Epicene, I often know I am acting wrong, tho' I have not courage enough to set myself right—Even in this case—Such is Mr. Lambton's character, so revered his good∣ness, that I will freely confess, I never undertook any project of the like nature with half the remorse or compunction I did this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are an original, by all that's whimsi∣cal!—How can you be so deliberately wicked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not—Youth and the impetuous dic∣tates of nature impel me—I dread to look back—Yet, cou'd I find but one of the sex above temptation, perhaps, I might be reclaim'd—But, no more, I want your immediate assistance in this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yours—don't be amaz'd—That was my errand hither.</P>

<P>The deuce it was!—to what end?</P>

<P>Why, as you are a particular friend, I'll spare you one of the girls.</P>

<P>I am much obliged to you, George, but I beg to be excused.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ha! ha! ha!—Are you afraid of ventu∣ring yourself with her? This is my business—Your House is very large, commodious, and retired.</P>

<P>As this is a particular case, I cou'd not so well manage every thing at one of those common receptacles—Besides, if there shou'd be any noise, it cannot so easily be heard there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, let's hear your scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I found that my father knew Mr. Lamb∣ton, and intended, had he not been called abroad so suddenly, to have drawn him from obscurity; I, like a dutiful son, was resolved to fulfil his desires, there∣fore counterfeiced a letter from him, inviting Mr. Lambton up to town, promising to provide hand∣somely for him—Full of primitive simplicity, he im∣mediately swallowed the bait, the family are just ar∣rived in London, and I am about to consummate my project.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>A hopeful one, I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only to separate the daughters from the father, and, under pretence of visiting my sister, bring them hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>How will you manage for a lady to represent her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I dress you up? They are igno∣rant of the world, and the deceit will easily pass up∣on them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that I think would be carrying the joke too far—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did but jest, I have already provided one for the character—You'll have no objection tho', I hope, to lend me a helping hand upon the occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you'll free me from any danger which may ensue on a discovery, I confess I shou'd like the frolic well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear—Yours will be an agreeable task, to entertain the eldest—She's wild and flighty, owing to the solitude she was educated in, yet fraught with such Innocence and simplicity, that had I not beheld her sister, every wish wou'd have been gratified in her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you want me to amuse her, while you be∣siege your favourite object?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do; who in such a situation, I think, cannot fail to surrender.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What do you imagine the father will be do∣ing in the mean time?</P>
</SP>

<P>I have taken care the shall not interrupt me, and now that matters are settled with you, I'll step and see how they do after their journey.</P>

<P>Do you hear, George, come back directly that I may know how to proceed.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lambton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank heaven! we are safe ar∣rived—'Twas a fatiguing journey for one of my years, and nothing could have induced me to revisit the world, but the hopes of you, my children, reap∣ing some future advantage from it—As for myself,
<PB N="11" REF="24"/>declined in the vale of life, I was content with my situation—I thankfully enjoyed the blessings of pro∣vidence, nor envied the ideal happiness of those above me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, papa, I think you were much in the right—For my part, I prefer a cottage with vir∣tue, to a palace with guilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lambton.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I, yet I think it possible to gain the palace without partaking of the guilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid you'll find yourself mistaken, sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not—Every Thing at present seems fair for it—Under the protection of so great a man as the Earl of Witton, what have we to fear?—Are not we to be introduced to Lord Promise's sister?—What may not she do for us?—I'm sure if I enjoy'd her fortune my heart would delight in find∣ing out proper objects to make happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, child, it shou'd be the province of those whom providence hath thus distinguished, and I acknowledge I've heard the best of characters of both—I am not apt lightly to distrust, yet when I reflect on our situation, it makes me dread a disap∣pointment—Above two hundred miles from home—Our money almost exhausted in coming hither—Not even an acquaintance in London to apply to—And two daughters, in some degree objects of temptation, exposed to the snares of such a town as this, with on∣ly an aged father to protect them—In such—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can assure you, papa, you torment yourself with groundless chimeras—Could any one behave more politely than Lord Promise?—Did not he say you might depend upon his father's friendship for you—Is not his letter the greatest security—Sure∣ly then you cannot hesitate a moment, in preferring affluence, to the indigence we have just quitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter, he that possesses content is richer than a scepter'd monarch—What cares had I to disturb me at Monktown?—My honest friends and neighbours, during the many years I passed
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>amongst them, regarded me as a father, friend, and Instructor. Poor people! my heart is with you still—But I must now go see that Ralph has got our little baggage sage, we need not expect to meet here with that fidelity and simplicity which characterizes our untaught villagers.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still, sister, I find you have not a ve∣ry favourable opinion of the cause which brought us hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I have not—Ever since leaving our peaceful dwelling, I know not why, but an unusual sadness has taken possession of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's easily accounted for—It is because you left that dear, sweet, sighing swain of yours, Mr. Wilville, behind—Tho' Sir Harry Tem∣ple was with him, yet I was not sad—Our journey, to me, seem'd enchantingly pleasant—Oh, Lud!—The swiftness of our expedition—the variety of ob∣jects—the uncommon politeness we were treated with on the road—the amazing noise, hurry, and bustle we saw in coming hither, has filled my mind with images I never had the least Idea of before—Oh! happy, happy creatures, who continually enjoy such blessings without interruption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, not so happy as you imagine, sis∣ter—There may be real enjoyments here as well as in retirement, but I am apt to think true content is easier to be found in the moss-grown cot, than the cloud-aspiring dome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>There again we differ—I am heartily weary of solitude, and leave to you the undisturbed enjoyment of going to rest with the sun, that, like him, you may be the harbinger of morn—treading the cowslip bending green, to visit your lowing herds, who constantly welcome and reward you with over∣flowing bowls of nectar—at noon, feasting on pa∣triarchal luxuries—towards eve—but let that suffice. Contrast it with what Lord Promise told us of a sine lady's life—Rising at noon—paying morning visits—
<PB N="13" REF="26"/>dining at six—dressing—then whirling away to routs, balls, assemblies, masquerades, where brilliant com∣pany, music, dancing, and card parties make the time glide insensibly away, till blushing morn un∣folds the fringed curtains of the gilded east, and tears them unwillingly from their half enjoyed pleasures—If such a description be true, who, in their senses, wou'd have a doubt which to prefer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, we had better not entirely depend up∣on all Lord Promise told us—A little time, I am afraid, will dispel the mist which overshadows your reason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then if it be a mist, sister, I never desire it to be removed—Adieu, I hope for ever, to those purling rills, deep embower'd shades, and fleecy nibblers of the plain, that hitherto have been our companions; a brighter scene now opens to my view, and if Sir Harry Temple knew but where to trace us, my joys then wou'd be compleat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flatter not yourself so much, Charlotte, as to imagine we have such power over them—To ac∣cident only are we indebted for their acquaintance—nor have we a right to expect it to continue—'Tis true, they did us a signal piece of service in res∣cuing us from such a crew of gypsies, who, meet∣ing us where they did, wou'd probably have robb'd, perhaps murder'd us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall ever remember their heroic be∣haviour—How soon they dispersed and put to flight those dastardly wretches—Your fright gave you ad∣ditional charms, and, notwithstanding your timidity and delicacy, you gave sufficient testimonies that your deliverer was not indifferent to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much otherwise, I fear, for my future peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb,</SPEAKER>
<P>The adventure was so much to my taste, that I enjoyed it—My champion, I thought, received my acknowledgments with surprize—Per∣haps,
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>he did not expect such language from the rus∣ticity of our appearance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, really, it was something uncommon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have often seen them since, and they as often offered up their vows—Our father seem'd pleas'd with their visits, knows both their families, and acknowledges them accomplish'd gen∣tlemen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, he does, but appearances are oft deceitful—I confess Wilville raised emotions in my breast, I had till then been a stranger to—The confusion I was in, the danger he rescued me from, attended with such a tender, respectful behaviour, beyond what I had ever seen or imagined, made too deep an impression on me ever to be erased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall keep you in countenance, for my heart, I believe, is in pretty near the same condi∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I left the country with regret, as I had not an opportunity of acquainting him with our sudden departure—I wish, yet fear, to see him again—Pray heaven he be sincere in his professions! for I find the future happiness of my life depends upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you need not have the least doubt of—I dare say they were distracted on missing us, and have dispatch'd emissaries around the country in quest of us.</P>

<P>Not in the least—Ladies, I am happy in seeing you look so well after your journey—I thought it impossible your charms could have received addi∣tion, yet I find change of air, and extraordinary ex∣ercise, have given encreasing lustre to the vermeil tincture of your cheeks.</P>

<P>There is no occasion for that, Sir, they were sufficiently captivating before—I rode post to town, Mr. Lambton, to apprise my father of your coming, but unluckily found him laid up in a fit of the gout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so am I, especially as it deprives him of the pleasure of welcoming you as he intend∣ed—But, I hope, a few days will set him on his legs again, and then—not that he hath been idle, there is something in view, which, in all probability, will, in a very short time, make you ample amends for the injuries of fortune.</P>

<P>Yes, Lady Fanny, the worst of villany—The wretch who wantonly deprives the credulous virgin of her innocence and peace of mind, deserves an epithet much worse than that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has my brother been such a wretch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has, Madam—Pardon my thus disturb∣ing you with a repetition of my wrongs, I thought to have conceal'd them 'till I had found their author—But griefs like mine will force their way—After six-and-twenty years spent in the service of my country, I vainly hoped to pass my latter days in ease and tranquillity, blest, as I thought myself, in a daughter, where grace and modesty united to adorn the curious workmanship of heaven.</P>

<P>Lord Promise, Madam, whom unsuspecting∣ly I admitted to my inmost friendship, in an evil hour, gain'd on the fond affection of an artless girl, and, for a few moments unworthy gratification, plunged a dagger in a father's breast, and entailed eternal infamy, shame, and sorrow on the very crea∣ture, whom honour should have obliged him to pro∣tect</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful powers!—Can I be related to fuch a monster—Now do I readily account for the fettled melancholy which preyed upon the lovely girl before she quitted London, and which I in vain urged her to disclose—But why did you not inform me of this before?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>An indignant shame tied up my tongue—My hand, tho' old, I hoped was not quite unnerved, on that alone I relied for satisfaction—Yet there I was disappointed, to avoid my resentment he quitted the kingdom—Defeated of my revenge, I retired to a little retreat in the farthest part of Devonshire, ta∣king with me the tear-concealing, yet almost grief-consumed object of his loose desires.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Eugenia!—Little did I suspect the cause of your retreat, if I had, you shou'd not have gone without a partner in your sorrows.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can souls so nearly allied by nature, dif∣fer so much in sentiment!—There, a few months af∣ter, I was presented with a grandson—An event which almost deprived the wretched mother of life, in giving birth to the innocent fruit of their guilty commerce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an affecting story!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have lived ever since in the utmost pri∣vacy, waiting an opportunity for revenge or justice. Last week I received intelligence from a friend, whom I entrusted with the secret, that he was re∣turned; this hastened me up to town with my little family—Hitherto he hath evaded my search—This
<PB N="23" REF="36"/>house I thought the most likely place to find him, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Major, I am happy in meeting with you—For the love of mercy suspend your anger—Perhaps I may procure you reparation, at least, as far as 'tis in his power to make it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Madam, I had much rather have redress from equity than the sword—else shou'd I now have conceal'd my purpose—But, if the first fail, I am determined to have recourse to the lat∣ter—If I fall, my sorrows fall with me, and he will have the glory of compleatly finishing the misfortunes of an unhappy family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there will be no fear of that—Pray is Miss Standfield still in town?</P>

<P>She is, Madam.</P>

<P>Might I hope for the pleasure of seeing her here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, my Lady, that will be impossi∣ble—There is a conscious inferiority attending fallen innocence, which dreads to look up at the unble∣mished front of virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me, that should not be—From our earliest acquaintance I always esteem'd her as a friend, but now, I love her as a sister—Let me en∣treat you to conduct her hither.</P>

<P>I will try, Madam, if I can persuade her to it.</P>

<P>I own you have not all the ease and elegance I cou'd wish, but it can't be helped, and you must do your best</P>

<P>And bad enough, I am afraid, that will be—You wou'd make me be thrust up in this manner—I'm sure I was easier and better in my own shapes—Now, pray may I ask, what is all this mighty rout about?</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Because I am sure I shall be dashed—For tho' I am reckon'd as tight a lad, and as feat a dancer as any at our maying, yet, if you'll believe me, I can scarce pull up courage enough to shew my shapes amongst the lasses, and you know we have some prime ones.</P>

<P>Yes, I always was said to have grace—Master himself often told me that I was a gracious lad.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I mean that you are genteel.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh—Why, for certain, all the lasses used to prefer me for my gentility.</P>

<P>Very well then—be ruled by me, Ralph, and I don't doubt but every thing will suc∣ceed to my wish.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, may I be shot if I don't, as well as if you were my own sister—Nay, why shou'dn't I?—I must be very ungrateful indeed, if I did not—I'm sure master has been more than a father to me.</P>

<P>I am sorry I shou'd make you wait—Pray, Sir, what are your commands with me?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Promise, I presume, hired these lodgings for us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Lordship informed me you was a parti∣cular friend of his, and requested, as a favour, that I wou'd accommodate you, to prevent the inconveni∣ences attending common lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Lordship was very good—I ima∣gine, Sir, you are well acquainted with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had the honour of knowing his Lord∣ship these several years past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon, Sir, for being so inquisitive—My reason was, an ambiguous note his Lordship put into my hand at leaving this, which you are to explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was it, pray, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>A draft for an hundred pounds, with these words—<Q>I hope Mr. Lambton will accept of this triste as an earnest of my wishes to serve him. I dare not be more explicit at present, but Mr. Varnish can fully inform him of particulars. PROMISE</Q></P>

<P>True, Sir, his Lordship has repos'd that con∣fidence in me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I shall take it as a favour if you'll explain his meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, Sir—Lord Promise is a Nobleman of the strictest honour and greatest gene∣rosity.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't doubt it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you his generosity is unbounded—I have seen such instances of it as wou'd amaze you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I have, since my short know∣ledge of him, experienced many proofs of his bene∣volence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear Sir, nothing to his desires or inten∣tions—The moment he saw you and your family, he was resolv'd to serve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How few Noblemen have such great∣ness of soul!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very few indeed, Sir—He observed, with concern, that you had lived many years in the world to little purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir? I hope not—I endeavour∣ed to fulsil the will of him who placed me in such a situation, and that I thought the principal end of my creation—If I have erred, I trust he will forgive me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, you mistake my meaning—He found you grown grey in obscurity, without the least reward for such merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I've had the greatest reward that cou'd possibly have been bestow'd upon me here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir!—What was it, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>The testimony of a good conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find it so, Sir—tho' 'tis more than I can say for myself <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—But Lord Promise wishes to reward such goodness in this world—He has many relations of great dignity in the world—They have heard your character from the Earl, and you may depend upon being speedily provided for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall I acknowledge so many un∣merited obligations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very easily—I hope, Mr. Lambton, your long retirement from the world has not contracted your notions of life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not, Sir—On the contrary, the long heart-felt serenity I've enjoy'd, has expand∣ed every grateful and noble thought within me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I shou'd not wonder at it—Persons long buried in solitude, are apt to look with a gloomy aspect on the harmless amusements of the world—And those things, in their nature perfectly innocent, they, with a cynic severity, condemn as absolutely criminal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far otherwise with me, I assure you, Sir—I look on all mankind as my brethren, as such I love, and wou'd, if possible, serve them—For sure∣ly that wretch must be dead to all feelings, whose bosom admits not that heav'n-born child of mercy, sweet charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad, Sir, to find you have such enlarged notions—Can you then be so chimerical as to prefer an empty name, a few imaginary virtues, to solid substantial happiness?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't comprehend you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Believe me, Temple, I have as much courage as you, tho' not of that flaming kind—I wish for an opportunity of rescuing these victims from his infer∣nal clutches, not of signalizing my valour—He has too much spirit for so bad a heart—What wou'd be the consequence of such a meeting?

<P>Good heav'ns! am I betray'd then?</P>

<P>Betray'd, my charmer! no, far from it—Can you call it betraying to live in endless felicity with him who adores you?—To be sole disposer of my life, my fortune, my happiness?—Come, thou tempting love-inviting fair one, let us not waste the precious moments which may be better spent in dis∣solving transports!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me a proof of it, my Lord, by resto∣ring me to my liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="50"/>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Demand any other proof but that, and I will satisfy you—Make me happy, and possess every thing I can bestow—'Tis not in my power to marry you or I would, but I can make you an offering of what few wives enjoy, an undivided heart—Your father shall be made easy for life—Your sister shall partake of our felicity—All will owe their happiness to you, and my behaviour must oblige you to confess that my love and generosity shall deserve the sur∣render you make—The devil's in't if this won't do—I'm sure l've almost talk'd myself into a behef of the truth of it—</P>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think it possible, my Lord, that all the riches of the East cou'd tempt me a moment to deviate from the paths of virtue?—No, destitute as I am at this instant of a friend, except in heaven—conscious of being entirely in your power, without the least human means to escape—yet, such is my reliance on providence, that I am regardless of the consequences—You may kill me, if you please, but you cannot triumph over my innocence—and I have this consolation in the midst of my distress, that there is a being will amply revenge my cause, and reward my trivial sufferings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the devil's the matter with me, that I am affected thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You hesitate, my Lord—If your breast be susceptible of pity or manly sentiment, do not take an ungenerous advantage of the helpless condition you have reduced me to, nor give me cause to look upon you as the destroyer of my peace and tranquil∣lity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely persuasive force dwells on her hea∣venly accents!—There must be some magic power in virtue, when it can charm even such a son of vice as I am!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mighty conquest you have gain'd, indeed, my Lord!—Deceiv'd a poor old man, who near had reach'd his journey's end, without this fatal stroke to
<PB N="38" REF="51"/>help it, and thus betray'd to ruin his two unsuspect∣ing daughters!—Oh, my father! little did your fond honest heart imagine the reward preparing for your toilsome journey hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly I have been long deceived!—Virtue is more than a name, or I could never feel these heart-rending compunctions—I must retire, or she'll make a compleat proseylite of me—</P>
<STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a sister, my Lord, whom you dearly love, an honour'd parent, whose life, per∣haps, depends on her prosperity, what must you think of that man who wantonly endeavours to de∣stroy so fair a prospect?—How much nobler he, who, commanding his passions, gives proof of his great∣ness of soul, by acknowledging his errors and ma∣king every atonement in his power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus agitated, Maria?—By heav'n you've no cause—I love you to distraction, and can∣not live without you—Yet I will not force your incli∣nations—I am not that monster neither—My tender∣ness, my generosity, my respect shall rather gain you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, if you have the least tenderness, the least humanity in your nature, restore me to those, I am united to by duty and inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And lose my hopes for ever—it cannot be, 'tis too great a sacrifice.</P>

<P>Will you endeavour it?</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How like a scoundrel I look now, defeated of my purpose! <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE> Be compos'd, Madam, I leave you in perfect security, and hope my excess of pas∣sion will, in some measure, plead my excuse for what is past.</P>

<P>I am, however, glad, Charlotte, that your eyes are at last opened to see the fallacy of your wild ideas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say no more, sister, I am heartily asham'd and mortified already—I begin to see things in a new light, but my experience had like to have cost me dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, my dear, to be sensible of having acted wrong, is pain sufficient to the ingenious mind, therefore I have done—What do you think of our

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse us, Madam; in the present pertur∣bation of our minds, refreshment is not worth a thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible, ladies, the part I have acted in this affair must make me appear odious in your eyes, as it has contemptible in my own, yet, if you will but hear me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too much have we heard already, to be any longer impos'd upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, I do not mean it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, vice! what power has thou attain'd, when thou wear'st the semblance that virtue us'd to pride in!—A form like yours, surely, never was de∣sign'd to be an instrument in a scheme so detestable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Abhorr'd be the hour I ever was!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I can read aright, you are not one of those who are harden'd in the ways of guilt—Your appear∣ance speaks you sprung from parents who wou'd hide their heads in shame at your unhappy conduct—Have you unwarily deviated from the paths of virtue? add not to your crimes by endeavouring to make others equally wretched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall I say to gain belief?—Ap∣pearances, I own, are strong against me—but black as I may seem, hear but my melancholy story, and then refuse me pity if you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed, and be assured we wish to find it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold before you the only, and once prided daughter, of an ancient happy couple, as Love and Hymen ever yet united—to myself alone I owe my ruin—unmindful of their precepts, and trusting in the force of my imaginary charms, I fell unthinkingly in the fatal snare laid by the most art∣ful
<PB N="56" REF="69"/>of men—Lord Promise triumph'd over my inno∣cence—To conceal my shame, I left my tender pa∣rents, and ventur'd into the world destitute of for∣tune, friends, or virtue!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unhappy consequences of one false step!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fatally so, indeed!—Deserted, despis'd, and hateful to myself, I cou'd only have recourse to the author of my ruin—for a while he behav'd with tenderness, cool indifference succeeded, and I was soon oblig'd to give place to newer objects—What cou'd I do? my dependance was solely upon him—I bore my fate with resignation, conscious of having deserv'd it, but when he oblig'd me to act a part in your deception, my remorse grew too violent to be stifled—Thank heav'n he has hitherto fail'd in his de∣signs—and I am now come with a determin'd reso∣lution either to effect your deliverance, or share your fate while you remain here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we have still some hopes, and provi∣dence has not yet deserted us!—But what's to be done? how get from these unhallow'd walls?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be a difficult task▪ I am afraid, guarded as you are by his watchful emissaries.</P>

<P>Nay, if you did, 'twou'd be to no purpose, they, alas! are many miles from hence—all hopes of relief from them are vain—But do you know Lord Promise's Sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have slight knowledge of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe she will be the only probable means of our delivery—Suppose you throw yourself upon her generosity—confess your whole affecting story, and relate our cruel detention—I think, if her breast be not totally void of every feminine virtue, she will pity you, and protect us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="70"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, Madam, Iscarce can gather cou∣rage to approach her; yet to release you, and in some measure atone for past offences, I wou'd submit to any thing, however humiliating.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me persuade you to go thither.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Spen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I will.</P>

<P>But this instant—consider our situation—a moment's delay may put it out of her power to re∣lieve us.</P>

<P>I'll go directly—in the mean time pray take a dish of tea, and recruit your exhausted spirits.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My poor girls!—they have indeed seen very little of the world, nor have they any thing to recommend them to the company they are in, except it be their innocence and virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Mr. Lambton, you have reason to be proud of them—they charm every one with their behaviour—Lady Fanny loves them already like sisters, nay, she says it will be their own faults, if
<PB N="58" REF="71"/>they do not always rank so in her esteem, as her hap∣piness is wound up in theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her goodness is too much, too much for such unworthy objects—for how is it possible they can contribute to her happiness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you, Sir, how violently fond my Lord is of Miss Maria—every minute encreases his passion, and it is now arriv'd at such a pitch, that he cannot live an hour without her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Live an hour without her!—You can∣not mean it, sure?</P>

<P>Oh, wou'd to heav'n I cou'd!—For goodness sake, Sir, explain your dark ambiguous meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am come, Sir, to congratulate you on the happy change of your affairs—Lord Promise has al∣ready obtain'd a vacant place of two hundred pounds a year for you; Miss Maria has five hundred pounds yearly settled upon her during life, besides house, equipage, servants, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!—hold, for the love of charity! On what conditions were all these things obtain'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conditions! none, Sir—Lord Promise is too generous to exact any—all he desires in return, is to be assur'd of Miss Maria's unalterable love and con∣stancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful powers! how is my old ago∣nizing heart torn by a thousand different emotions! If you have any humanity in you, answer me truly—Are my Lord's designs upon my daughter honour∣able, or not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely, Sir, upon my credit.</P>

<P>I wish I may find them so.</P>

<P>'Tis true, it is not in his power to marry her; what of that, you cannot surely be so weak and blind

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Var.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what end, Sir, shou'd I now impose on you?—Your daughter has accepted of my Lord's love and tenderness—she now has sent me to request you'd make yourself easy at what has happen'd, and, as soon as your first emotions are over, will be glad to see you; in the mean time, if you will write her word that you are satisfied with her conduct, and happy, she will be compleatly so.</P>

<P>Tantalize not such a wretch as me with the name of happiness!—Oh, cruel, cruel girl, thus to pierce the bosom of a tender, doting father!

<P>Compassion, said'st thou?—if thou hast the least tincture of it in thy composition, have pity on a wretched father, born down with age and sor∣rows—torture me not in this manner, 'tis too much for my feeble nature long to support—let me but see my children, and I shall be easier.</P>

<HI>Enter Major</HI> STANDFIELD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Major Standfield!—'tis too much!—I cannot, dare not stand his presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can, and must, brother—he is not come to hurt your mind with keen reproaches, but rather to pour the healing balm of peace into the corroding wounds of vice, which long have rankled in your breast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it cannot be—I do not hope for∣giveness—Major, I bare my breast—there is no way but this to expiate guilt like mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is, my Lord, a nobler way—a way which earth and heav'n must both approve—prepare yourself for more wonder.</P>
<STAGE>[Goes out, and returns with his daughter leading her little boy]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, all ye powers! what is it I behold?—Can it be real, or is it the phantom of my Eugenia, risen from the dead, to set my crimes in full array be∣fore me?—I must, I will embrace it!—Ha! it sinks!—help to support her—look down ye bright celestial inhabitants of glory, and restore this injur'd saint to life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Miss Stand.—(recovering)</HI>—</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, my Lord, these wild effusions of a heart overpower'd with love and tenderness speak well the unrestrain'd dictates of its owner—but I must curb its transports—Look here, another object demands your fondest care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can it be possible such happiness is in store for me! am I father too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maj.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are, my Lord, if you'll own the obliga∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Own it! ay, prouder of that title than to be hail'd an Indian monarch!—My cherub! my lit∣tle cherub! receive a father's first embraces!—Now, my Eugenia, we are met, never to be separated more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, my Lord—That I have lov'd you, nay, that I shall continue to do so while life keeps her seat, is the only excuse I can offer for my frailty—I have hitherto obey'd my father's will, per∣mit
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>me now to follow the dictates of my own—Had I my innocence, and was mistress of the untold trea∣sures of the east—all that the sun surveys in his di∣urnal round, you shou'd be master of it—but cover'd with infamy as I am, tho' you cou'd raise me to the utmost pinnacle where star-crown'd virtue ought to sit—a conscious pride wou'd forbid the exaltation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Epi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! a charming girl! what a pity 'tis she shou'd be lost to the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Pro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is then my dream of bliss destroy'd?—my new-found blessing, turn that way, and intercede with your inexorable mother—tell her my peace here and hereafter depends upon her receiving my peni∣tential vows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Stand.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, the honey-dropping tongue of seraphic eloquence cannot move me to change my purpose—I have now attain'd my utmost wishes, to see you thoroughly sensible of your failings, and wou'd fain retire to that peaceful cottage which this event has drawn me from, there, with my little rose∣lipp'd comforter, pass my future hours in undisturbed solitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Fan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Press her no farther, brother—leave it to time—when she is sufficiently assured of your steady perseverance in the paths of rectitude, the love she acknowledges for you may probably induce her at last to reward your constancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Lady Fanny, with your leave, we'll retire and celebrate the surprizing events of this happy day, events which must fully manifest to every boholder, that however virtue may for a time be opprest and held in durance, yet is it always the pe∣culiar, and never-deserted favourite, of rewarding Providence.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by a FRIEND,</BYLINE>
<STAGE>And spoke by Mr. CRESSWICK, in the Character of the MACARONI.</STAGE>
<SP>
<L>It matters not, good solks, say what you will,</L>
<L>Approve, or disapprove our author's skill,</L>
<L>'Tis sure there must be <HI>Macaronies</HI> still.</L>
<L>For phantom-fashion leads us by the nose,</L>
<L>And makes us die for every whim she shews.</L>
<L>A coat, a club, a feather, will engage</L>
<L>A genius of the <HI>Bon Ton</HI> for an age;</L>
<L>Like <HI>Newton's</HI> system, bear th' inventor's name,</L>
<L>And rank him higher in the lists of fame.</L>
<L>In <HI>English</HI> garb, we know, plain common-sense</L>
<L>To modish understanding gives offence;</L>
<L>And modest merit, if perchance one meets,</L>
<L>How awkward creeps the stranger thro', the streets!</L>
<L>Whilst fan-tail'd folly, with <HI>Parisian</HI> air,</L>
<L>Commands that homage sense alone shou'd share,</L>
<L>The world's so <HI>macaronied</HI> grown of late,</L>
<L>That common mortals now are out of date;</L>
<L>No single class of men this merit claim,</L>
<L>Or high, or low, in faith 'tis all the same;</L>
<L>For see the Doctor, who, with sapient, wig,</L>
<L>Gold cane, grave phiz, ere while look'd more than big,</L>
<L>With <HI>France</HI>'s foretop decorates his face,</L>
<L>Prescribes and dresses with <HI>macaronied</HI> grace;</L>
<L>Then swears he hates all formal stuff,</L>
<L>For gravity in practice is a puff.</L>
<L>The Soldier, once that hardy son of arms,</L>
<L>Whose soul was rouz'd, was fir'd with war's alarms,</L>
<L>Forgets the eminence on which he stood,</L>
<L>Whene'er his country call'd, how boil'd his blood!</L>
<L>Resigns the glory his forefathers won,</L>
<L>And lives <HI>Britannia</HI>'s alienated son.</L>
<L><PB REF="92"/>
Still lower let us fall for once, and pop</L>
<L>Our heads into a moders Barber's shop;</L>
<L>What the result? or what behold we there?</L>
<L>A set of <HI>Macaronies</HI> weaving hair.</L>
<L>Such gen'ral folly your attention claims,</L>
<L>And satire here at reformation aims;</L>
<L>On me this night exerts its utmost sskill,</L>
<L>Corrects, reforms, and moulds me to its will.</L>
<L>Ye gentle fair, wou'd but such triflers view</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> pretty s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves, much more in you;</L>
<L>Wou'd they to sense and virtue bend the knee,</L>
<L>Leave to its native soil all foppery,</L>
<L>Nature wou'd cease to weep—The godlike plan</L>
<L>Wou'd elevate, in time, un-monkey man,</L>
<L>With hospitable smiles old british truth</L>
<L>Wou'd warm your beauty, and adorn our youth.</L>
