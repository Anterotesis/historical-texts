<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY A FRIEND;</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY Mr. WADDY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>I COME not to announce a bashful maid</L>
<L>Who ne'er has try'd the drama's doubtful trade,</L>
<L>Who sees with flutt'ring hope the curtain rise,</L>
<L>And scans with timid glance your critic eyes;</L>
<L>My client is a more experienc'd dame,</L>
<L>Tho' not a Veteran, not unknown to Fame,</L>
<L>Who think your favours are an honest boast,</L>
<L>Yet fears to forfeit what she values most;</L>
<L>Who has, she trusts, some character to lose,</L>
<L>E'en tho' the woman did not aid the Muse;</L>
<L>Who courts with modest aim the public smile,</L>
<L>That stamp of merit, and that meed of toil.</L>
<L>At Athens once (our author has been told)</L>
<L>The Comic Muse, irregularly bold,</L>
<L>With living calumny profan'd her stage,</L>
<L>And forg'd the frailties of the faultless sage.</L>
<L>Such daring ribaldry you need not fear,</L>
<L>We have no Socrates to libel here.</L>
<L>Ours are the follies of an humbler flight,</L>
<L>Offspring of manners volatile and light;</L>
<L>Our gen'ral satire keeps more knaves in awe,</L>
<L>Our court of conscience comes in aid of law.</L>
<L>Here scourg'd by wit, and pilloried by fun,</L>
<L><HI>Ten thousand</HI> coxcombs blush instead of <HI>one.</HI></L>
<L>If scenes like these could make the guilty shrink,</L>
<L>Could teach unfeeling Folly how to think,</L>
<L>Check Affectation's voluble career,</L>
<L>And from cold Fashion force the struggling tear,</L>
<L>Our author would our loudest praise forego,</L>
<L>Content to feel within "what passes show,"</L>
<L>"But since" (she says) "such hopes cannot be mine,</L>
<L>"Such bold pretensions I must needs resign,</L>
<L>"Tell these great judges, of dramatic laws,</L>
<L>"Their reformation were my best applause;</L>
<L>"Yet if the heart my proud appeal withstands,</L>
<L>"I ask the humbler suffrage of their hands."</L>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE I.</HI> An Apartment at Mr. <HI>NORBERRY's</HI></HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter Sir</HI> WILLIAM DORRILLON, <HI>and Mr.</HI> NOR∣BERRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> NORBERRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY blame me?—Why blame me?—My sister had the sole management of your daughter by your own authority; from the age of six years, till within eight months of the present time, when, in consequence of my sister's death, she was trans∣ferred to my protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your sister, Mr. Norberry, was a pru∣dent, good woman—she never could instruct her in all this vice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, my dear friend, that Miss Dorrillon, your daughter, came to my house just the same heedless woman of fashion you now see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>impatiently.</STAGE> Very well—'Tis very well.—But, when I think on my disappointment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing which may not be repaired. Maria, with you for a guide—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! She turns me into ridicule—laughs at me! This morning, as she was enumerating some of her frivolous expences, she observed me lift up my hands and sigh; on which she named fifty other extravagances she had no occasion to men∣tion, merely to enjoy the pang which every solly of her sends to my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do not charge this conduct of your daughter to the want of filial love:—did she know you were sir William Dorrillon, did she know you were her father, every word you uttered, every look you glanced, would be received with gentle∣ness and submission:—but your present rebukes from Mr. Mandred (as you are called), from a perfect stranger, as she supposes, she considers as an imper∣tinence which she has a right to resent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I had continued abroad. And yet, the hope of beholding her, and of bestowing upon her the riches I acquired, was my sole support through all the toils by which I gained them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, considering her present course of life, your riches could not come more opportunely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She shall never have a farthing of them. Do you think I have encountered the perils of almost every climate, to squander my hard-earned fortune upon the paltry vicious pleasures in which she de∣lights? No.—I have been now in your house ex∣actly a month—I will stay but one day longer—and then, without telling her who I am, I will leave the kingdom and her for ever—Nor shall she know that this insignificant merchant whom she despises, was her father, till he is gone, never to be recalled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are offended with some justice, but, as I have often told you, your excessive delica∣cy and respect for the conduct of the other sex, de∣generate into rigour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—for what I see so near perfection as woman, I want to see perfect. <HI>We,</HI> Mr. Norber∣ry, can never be perfect; but surely women, wo∣men, might easily be made angels!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if they were, we should soon be glad to make them into women again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir William</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>inattentive to Mr. Norberry.</STAGE>
<P>—She sets the example. <HI>She</HI> gives the fashion!—and now your Whole house, and all your visitors, in imitation of <HI>her,</HI> treat me with levity, or with contempt.—But I'll go away to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you desert your child in the mo∣ment she wants your protection? That exquisite beauty just now become mature—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's my difficulty!—There's my struggle!—If she were not so like her mother, I could leave her without a pang—cast hey off, and think no more of her.—But that shape! that face! those speaking looks! Yet, how reversed!—Where is the diffidence, the humility—where is the simpli∣city of my beloved wife? Buried in her grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, in all this great town, you may never see even its apparition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rejoice, however, at the stratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart: de∣prived by the means of searching it in her early years, had I at present come as her father, she might have deceived me with counterfeit manners, till time dis∣closed the imposition.—Now at least, I am not imposed upon.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Servant.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Priory. <STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Priory!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old acquaintance of mine, though we seldom meet. He has some singularities; and yet, perhaps—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Lord Priory.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lord, I am glad to see you. Mr. Mandred <STAGE>introducing Sir Willian.</STAGE> My Lord, I hope I see you in perfect health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my house, after going through only a slight repair, so damp, that I dare not sleep in it: and so I am now sending and going all over the town to seek for lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then seek no farther, but take up your lodgings here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would ask me; for I am so delicately scrupulous in respect to lady Priory, that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray return home, and bring her hither immediately, with all your luggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am most extremely obliged to you <STAGE>very fervently</STAGE>; for into no one house belonging to any of my acquaintance would I take my wife, so soon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a visit, so as to domesticate, in the house of a married man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I enquire the reason of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is because I am married myself; and having always treated my wife according to the anci∣ent mode of treating wives, I would rather she should never be an eye-witness to the modern house∣hold management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ancients, I believe, were very affec∣tionate to their wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they had reason to be so; for their wives obeyed them. The ancients seldom gave them the liberty to do wrong: but modern wives do as they like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you suffer Lady Priory to do as she likes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when it is what I like too. But never, never else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not this draw upon you the cha∣racter of an unkind husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am proud of. Did you never observe, that seldom a breach of fidelity in a wise is exposed where the unfortunate husband is not said to be "the best creature in the world! Poor man, so good-natured!—Doatingly fond of his wife!—Indulged her in every thing!—How cruel in her to serve him so!" Now, if I am served <HI>so,</HI> it shall not be for my good-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you equally disapprove of every severity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>rapidly.</STAGE> What do you mean by seve∣rity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know you used to be rather vio∣lent in your temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I am still—apt to be hasty and passi∣onate
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
—but that is rather of advantage to me as a husband—it causes me to be obeyed without hesi∣tation—no liberty for contention, tears, or repin∣ing. I insure conjugal sunshine, by now and then introducing a storm; while some husbands never see any thing but a cloudy sky, and all for the want of a little domestic thunder to clear away the vapours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have long conceived indulgenee to be the bane of female happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is.—I know several wo∣men of fashion who will visit six place of different amusement on the same night, have company at home besides, and yet, for want of something more, they'll be out of spirits: my wife never goes to a public place, has scarce ever company at home, and yet is always in spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never visits operas, or balls, or routs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>How should she? She goes to bed every night exactly at ten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the name of wonder, how have you been able to bring her to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>By making her rise every morning at five.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so she becomes tired before night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tired to death. Or, if I see her eyes completely open at bed-time, and she asks me to play one game more at piquet, the next morning I jog her elbow at half after four.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose she does not reply to the signal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I turn the key of the door when I leave the chamber; and there I find her when I come home in the evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And without her having seen a creature all day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is in my favour; for not having seen a single soul, she is rejoiced even to see <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will she speak to you after such usage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you only considered how much a woman longs to speak after being kept a whole day silent, you would not ask that question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! this is the most surprising me∣thod!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. In ancient days, when man∣ners were simple and pure, did not wives wait at the table of their husbands? and did not angels witness the subordination? I have taught Lady Priory to practise the same humble docile obedience—to pay respect to her husband in every shape and every form, no careless inattention to <HI>me</HI>—no smiling politeness to others in preference to <HI>me</HI>——no putting <HI>me</HI> up in a corner—in all assemblies, she considers her husband as the first person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am impatient to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't expect a fine lady with high feathers; and the <HI>et caetera</HI> of an Eastern concubine; you will see a modest plain English woman, with a cap on her head, a handkerchief on her neck, and a gown of our own manufacture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Norberry, what a contrast must there be between Lady Priory and the ladies in this house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>starting.</STAGE> Have you ladies in this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarmed; they are both sin∣gle, and can give Lady Priory no ideas concerning the marriage state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure of that? Some single women are more informed than their friends believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>For these ladies, notwithstanding a few (what <HI>you</HI> would call) excesses, I will answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, I and my wife will be with you about nine in the evening; you know we go to-bed at ten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But remember you bring your own ser∣vants to wait on you at five in the morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall bring but one—my old servant Oliver, who knows all my customs so well, that I never go any where without him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that old servant your valet still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he is now a kind of gentleman in waiting. I have had no employment for a valet
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
since I married:—my wife, for want of dissipati∣on, has not only time to attend upon herself, but upon me. Do you think I could suffer a clumsy man to tie on my neckcloth, or comb out my hair, when the soft, delicate, and tender hands of my wife are at my command?<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>After this amiable description of a woman, how can I endure to see her, whom reasons bids me detest; but whom nature still—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here she comes; and her companion in folly along with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's another woman! that Lady Mary Raffle? How can you suffer such people in your house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is only on a visit for a few months—she comes every winter, as her family and mine have long been intimately connected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us go. Let us go. I can't bear the sight of them. <STAGE>Going.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, and for <HI>once</HI> behave with polite∣ness and good humour to your daughter—do—and I dare venture my life, she will neither insult nor treat you with disrespect. You know you al∣ways begin first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not I a right to begin first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is a right of which she is ig∣norant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And deserves to be so, and ever shall be so. <Q><HI>I</HI> stay and treat her with politeness and good hu∣mour?</Q> No—rather let her kneel and implore my pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Nor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suffer me to reveal who you are, and so she will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have now lost all my money, and all my jewels, at play; it is almost two years since I have received a single remittance from my father; and Mr. Norberry refuses to advance me a shilling more.—What I shall do to discharge a debt which must be paid either to-day or to-morrow, heaven knows!—Dear Lady Mary, you could lend me a small sum, could you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who? I! <STAGE>with surprise</STAGE>—My dear creature, it was the very thing I was going to ask of you: for when you have money, I know no one so willing to disperse it among her friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am not I?—I protest I love to part with my money; for I know with what pleasure I receive it myself, and I like to see that joy sparkle in another's eye, which has so often brightened my own. But last night ruined me—I must have mo∣ney somewhere—As you can't assist me, I must ask Mr. Norberry for his carriage, and immediately go in search of some friend that can lend me four, or five, or six, or seven hundred pounds. But the worst is, I have lost my credit—Is not that dread∣ful?</P>

<P>If you have not now, you once had; for I am sure Bronzely once paid his addresses to you.</P>

<P>Fool! And yet am I nearly as weak as he is? Else why do I linger in this house? Why feed my hopes with some propitious moment to wak∣en her to repentance?

<P>My dear Sir, will you do me the greatest fa∣vour in the world?—you must do it in an instant too.

<P>Consider, my dear Sir, how much less the fault is, if perpetrated by you, than by me! This is the first offence of the kind which, I dare say, you have committed this many a year; and it will be overlooked in <HI>you.</HI> But I have been suspected of two or three things of the same sort within a very short time; and I should never be forgiven.</P>

<P>Nor ought you to be forgiven—It would be scandalous in me to connive—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your impertinence to me, but more your offence to a woman of virtue, deserves punishment.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Mandred, I believe I have set∣tled it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Settled what <STAGE>anxiously.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least I have done all in my power to serve you: perhaps you don't know that Mr. Oliver divulged the whole affair. But I have waited on my Lady Priory, and I do believe I have settled it with her, to manage it so with my Lord, that every thing shall be hushed up. You may expect a few jests among your female acquaintance, and a few epigrams in the news-papers; but I verily believe every thing material is safe.—Is there any farther satisfaction which you demand from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at present—a man is easily satisfied who possesses both courage and strength to do him∣self right, whenever he feels his wrongs oppressive. I have as yet found but little inconvenience from the liberties you have taken with me; and what, just at this time far more engages my attention than revenge, is, an application to you for intelligence. Without farther preface, do you pay your addresses to the young lady who lives in this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I do, Sir—I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, I suppose, which of the two ladies I mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which ever you mean, Sir, 'tis all the same, for I pay my addresses to them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir W.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>starting.</STAGE> To them both!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, which of them do you love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Both, Sir——upon my word, both—I as∣sure you, both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you don't intend to marry both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't intend to marry either: and indeed, the woman whom I love best in the world, has a husband already. Do you suppose I could confine my affections to Lady Mary or Miss Dorrillon, af∣ter Lady Priory appeared? do you suppose I did not know who it was I met last night in the dark? wherever I visit, Mr. Mandred, I always make love
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
to every woman in the house: and I assure you they all expect it—I assure you, Sir, they all expect it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Sir</HI> William <HI>walks about in anger.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any further commands for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, one word more.—And you really have no regard for this girl who parted from you as I came in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, pardon me—I admire, I adore, I love her to distraction: and if I had not been so long acquainted with my Lady Mary, nor had seen my Lady Priory last night, I should certainly call Sir George Evelyn to an account for being so per∣petually with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>anxiously.</STAGE> Do you think he loves her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I dare say, as well as I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think she likes him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think she likes <HI>me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, with your method of affection, she may like him too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>She may, she may.—In short, there is no answering for what <HI>she</HI> likes—all whim and fligh∣tiness—acquainted with every body—coquetting with every body—and in debt with every body. Her mind distracted between the claims of lovers, and the claims of creditors,—the anger of Mr. Norberry, and the want of intelligence from he father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is in a hopeful way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it would be impossible to think of marrying her in her present state—for my part, I can't—and I question whether Sir George would.—But if her father comes home, and gives her the fortune that was once expected, why then I may possibly marry her myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>firmly.</STAGE> She will never have any for∣tune—I come from India lately, you know; and you may take my word her father is not coming over, nor will he ever come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then keep it a secret—don't tell her so
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
—poor thing! it would break her heart. She is doatingly fond of her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! how!—oh no, she can have no remembrance of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not of his person, perhaps: but he has constantly corresponded with her; sent her presents, and affectionate letters—and you know a wo∣man's heart is easily impressed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard her mention her father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to you—but to us who are kind to her, she talks of him continually. She cried bit∣terly the other day when the last ship came in, and there was no account of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did she? did she? <STAGE>eagerly.</STAGE> Aye, I suppose she is alarmed lest he should be dead, and all his fortune lost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe her affection for <HI>him</HI> is to∣tally unconnected with any interested views. I have watched her upon that head, and I believe she loves her father sincerely.</P>

<P>I thought so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you may be satisfied of that. Yes, she even quarrelled with me the other day for speak∣ing in your favour: you had put her in a passion, and she said <Q>no one that loved her, ought to have any respect for you.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much obliged to her—very much obliged to her. Did she say nothing more?</P>
</SP>

<P>Were they not unjust?—Is it a reproach, that, enveloped in the maze of fashionable life, she has yet preserved her virtue unsuspected? That, en∣cumbered with the expences consequent to her con∣nections, she has proudly disdained even from me the honourable offer of pecuniary aid? that her fond hope still fixes on the return of an absent pa∣rent, whose blessing she impatiently expects? and that I should have watched her whole conduct with an eye of scrutinizing jealousy, and yet have only beheld that which makes me aspire, as the summit of earthly happiness to become her husband?</P>

<P>Young man, I admire your warmth <STAGE>with great fervour and affection</STAGE> There is much compassion, and benevolence, and charity, in some∣times mistaking the vicious for the virtuous; and if in the heat of contention I have said a word reflect∣ing on your character, I am ready to avow my error, and before this company to beg your pardon.</P>

<P>And upon what pretence did you suppose I would be indulgent to you, move than to her?</P>

<P>By the good humour you appear in, my Lord, I venture to mention to you my distresses. I know the virtues of Lady Priory make my failings conspicuous; but then consider the different modes to which we have been habituated—she excluded from temptation—</P>

<P>I can't say I would have done so rash an action, had I been married to some women—to you, for instance—but I have not a doubt of Lady Pri∣ory's safety: her mind, I know, is secure; and I have servants in the house to protect her from per∣sonal outrage.

<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some friend of <HI>mine,</HI> I dare say, by mistake—Well, if it is so, she is extremely welcome to the good fortune which was designed for <HI>me.</HI> For my part, I could not submit to an obligation from every one—scarcely from any one—and from no one with so little regret as I submit to it from Sir George Evelyn. <STAGE>Exit, curtsying.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a situation is mine! I cannot bear solitude, and am ashamed to see company! I cannot bear to think on the ungrateful woman, and yet I can think of nothing else! It was her conduct which I imagined had alone charmed me; but I per∣ceive her power over my heart, though that conduct is changed!</P>

Dorrillon, a lover of yours has done the civilest thing by me!—As I live, here he is. How do you do, Sir George? I suppose you have all heard the news of Bronzely running away with—</P>

<P>I <HI>am</HI> humble, Lady Mary, and own I have had a better opinion of your sex than I ought to have had.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said she'd preserve her fidelity! Did not I always say so? Have I wavered once? Did I not always tell you all that she was only making game of Bronzely? Did I not tell you all so?</P>

<P>Then, indeed, my Lord, you said truly; for I return the arrantest blockhead—</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always said you would! But how is it? Where have you been? What occasion for a post-chaise? Instantly explain, or I shall forfeit that dignity of a husband to which, in those degenerate times, I have almost an exclusive right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>To reinstate you, my Lord, in those ho∣nours, I accompany Lady Priory; and beg public pardon for the opinion I once publicly professed, of your want of influence over her affections.</P>

<P>Taking advantage of your permission to call on her, by stratagem I induced her to quit your house, lest restraint might there act as my enemy.—But your authority, your prerogative, your honour

attached to her under my roof. She has held those rights sacred, and compelled even <HI>me</HI> to revere them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you all hear? I was sure it would turn out so!</P>

<P>This is the first time I ever knew the gallant's word taken for a woman's honour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will take her own word—the tongue which for eleven years has never in the slightest in∣stance deceived me, I will believe upon all occasions. My dear wife, boldly pronounce before this company that you return to me with the same affection and respect, and the self-same contempt for this man— <STAGE><HI>to</HI> Bronzely</STAGE>—you ever had. <STAGE>A short pause.</STAGE></P>

<P>How! Don't you fear me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>She speaks plainly to that question.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know I love truth—speak plainly to all their curiosity requires.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you command it then, my Lord—I confess that Mr, Bronzely's conduct towards me has caused a kind of sentiment in my heart——</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! What!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must believe her—"she has told you truth for eleven years."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sensation which—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop—any truth but this I could have borne.—Reflect on what you are saying—Consider what you are doing—Are these your primitive manners?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have continued those manners, had I known none but primitive men. But to pre∣serve ancient austerity, while by my husband's consent, I am assailed by modern gallantry, would be the task of a Stoic, and not of his female slave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear? Do you all hear? My Lord, do <HI>you</HI> hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do—I do—and though the sound distracts me, I cannot doubt her word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>It gives me excessive joy to hear you say so, because you will not then doubt me when I add that gratitude, for his restoring me so soon to you, is the only sentiment he has inspired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then my management of a wise is right after all!</P>
</SP>

<P>Mr. Bronzely, as your present behavi∣our has in great measure atoned for your former ac∣tions, I will introduce to your acquaintance my friend Sir William Dorrillon.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mandred, Sir William Dorrillon!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And considering, Sir, that upon one or two occasions I have been honoured with your confi∣dence—you will not be surprised, if the first com∣mand I lay upon my daughter, is—to take refuge from your pursuits, in the protection of Sir George Evelyn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may I hope, Maria?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—I will instantly put an end to all your hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>By raising you to the summit of your wishes, Alarmed at my severity, she has owned her readiness to become the subject of a milder govern∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P>She shall never repine at the election she has made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Pri.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir George, if you are a prudent man, you will fix your eyes on my little domestic state, and guard against a rebellion.</P>
</SP>

<P>Not the rigour of its laws has ever in∣duced me to wish them abolished.</P>

<P><STAGE>to Lady Pri.</STAGE> Dear Lady, you have made me think with reverence on the matrimonial compact—and I demand of you, Lady Mary—if, in con∣sequence of former overtures, I should establish a le∣gal authority over you, and become your chief ma∣gistrate—would you submit to the same controul to which Lady Priory submits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any controul, rather than have no chief magistrate at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Geo.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>to Miss Dor.</STAGE> And what do you say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Dor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Simply one sentence—A maid of the present day shall become a wife like those—of for∣mer times.</P>

<L>WELL, female critics, what's the sentence, say—</L>
<L>Can you with kindness treat this saucy play,</L>
<L>That gives to ancient dames the wreath of praise</L>

<L>Bring up good husbands first, and, on my life,</L>
<L>For every one we'll shew as good a wife.</L>
<L>Whate'er the errors in the nuptial state,</L>
