<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE any just Observations can be made upon the two Heads which we are now to consider, it is absolutely necessary to let the Reader a little in∣to the general Knowledge of the State of the Commerce between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as it now stands; and this cannot be done so as to give him a clear Understanding in the reading either the Treaty it self, or these Considerations, without letting him know what the Meaning of the Tariff of 1664, and the Tariff of 1699, so often now to be made mention of is, and as far as will consist with the Brevity of this Tract, to give an Abridgement of those Tariffs, as they concern the present Treaty of Commerce. The Necessity of understanding these Things per∣fectly before we can make any Judgment of the Matter in hand, is such, that it seems the most natural Introduction that could possibly be made to the Work, and without which, however the Book is written in <HI>English,</HI> it would be an un∣known Tongue to most of the Readers, and might as well have been written in <HI>Arabick,</HI> or any other Language or Character which no body could understand.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
A <HI>TARIFF in the French,</HI> as it may best be expounded to us in a Trading-Dialect, is no more or less than <HI>a Book of Rates,</HI> establishing the Duties and Customs of Goods exported and imported from and to the Kingdom of <HI>France:</HI> It is true, if you speak literally, it is the Acts of publick Authority, from whence the Books of Rates are collected, as our <HI>Books of Rates</HI> are, so many Abstracts of the Acts of Parliament, by which those Rates are establishe'd; and therefore, as our Laws of Customs are called Acts of Par∣liament, so those in <HI>France</HI> are called <HI>Edits du Roy, Declaration du Roy, Ordonnance du Roy, Ar∣rest du Conseild' Etat du Roy,</HI> and the like; and the Collection of them into a Body is call'd in <HI>French Recueil des Tarifs,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Table de Tarifs Arrests &amp; Reglemens des Droits de Entree &amp; Sortie,</HI> &amp;c. that is in <HI>English a Book of Rates,</HI> and nothing else.</P>
<P>It is therefore a Vulgar Error to think these Tariffs are Treaties between <HI>France</HI> and other Nations, and to say the Tariff between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> or between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. is to talk Nousense, or which is much the same thing, to say nothing to the Purpose, with this Exception only, That in several Treaties of Com∣merce there have been Agreements made, and Articles enter'd into, especially between <HI>France</HI> and the States-General, by which the Duties of Merchandises have been adjusted respectively; and in these Treaties the Tariffs in <HI>France,</HI> for∣merly made, have been made the Foundation, with such particular Additions, respecting the Duties of such or such Goods, about which they
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
have then treated and made any Alteration. Of this we have an Example; after the Treaty of <HI>Reswick,</HI> when, by a separate Treaty of Trade, tho' in former Cases the Duties in general were adjusted, yet new Agreements were made for sun∣dry things, the rest being refer'd to the Tariffs of other Years, and this was called indeed <HI>Tarif Ar∣reste Entre la France &amp; la Hollande:</HI> This was the 8th of <HI>December</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>It is necessary farther, as an Introduction to this Discourse, to observe that the general Tariffs, or Book of Rates, which have been made and are refer'd to in the present Treaties stand thus: That of 1664 was the most general, in which the <HI>English</HI> Merchandises and Manufactures paid, upon their Importation into <HI>France,</HI> very moderate Duties; and particularly of our Woollen Manifactures: Thus, <TABLE>

</TABLE></P>
<P>And the like of other Merchandises. These Duties were enlarg'd in the Year 1699, and by an <HI>Arrest du Conseil de Estat,</HI> 6. <HI>Sept.</HI> 1701, an en∣tire Prohibition of our Woollen Manufactures was publish'd, and new extravagant Duties laid upon those which were allow'd to be enter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
These Things being necessary to premise by way of Introduction on the Side of the <HI>French,</HI> it may suffice on the other Part to observe, that by sundry Acts of Parliament made on several Occa∣sions, and with various Prospects in <HI>England,</HI> seve∣ral additional Duties, and some Prohibitions have been laid upon and against the Goods and Mer∣chandises of the Growth of <HI>France,</HI> besides the general Prohibition, or final Stop, of Intercourse, or Commerce between the two Nations, occa∣sion'd by the Accident of the War.</P>
<P>As to particular Prohibitions, the chief are those first against Alamodes and Lustrings, in fa∣vour of the Company, who have erected the Ma∣nufactures of that kind here, and who, if those Prohibitions had not been made could not have succeeded.</P>
<P>Also, that for a Prohibition of all wrought Silks, for the Encouragement of the Broad-Wea∣vers in <HI>England,</HI> and without which they must have been reduc'd, if not quite ruin'd.</P>
<P>The high additional Duties were such as prin∣cipally respect the Wines and Brandies imported hither from <HI>France,</HI> which by the several Acts of Parliament establishing those Duties amount at this time as follows:<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>Wine <HI>per</HI> Ton</CELL>

</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>Brandy <HI>per</HI> Gallon</CELL>
<CELL>6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>These Duties being so great as to be equal al∣most to a Prohibition, stand as an Equivalent to the Impositions which the <HI>French</HI> have laid upon ours, and is the Foundation of the present De∣bate.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Thus much seems sufficient by way of Intro∣duction.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS ON THE Articles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As our Considerations extend to no other Part of the Treaty than what relates to Trade, and to the Duties and Impositions upon Merchandise, so we shall confine it according to the Title to the two particular Articles which have made so much Noise in the Town, <HI>viz.</HI> the Eighth and Ninth Articles.</P>
<P>The Eighth Article runs thus:<Q>Furthermore it is agreed and concluded as a ge∣neral Rule, That all and singular the Subjects of the most Serene Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of the most Serene the most Christian King, in all Countries and Places subject to their Power on each Side, as to all Duties, Impositions, or Customs whatsoever, concerning Persons, Goods and Merchandizes, Ships, Freights, Seamen, Navigation and Commerce, shall use and enjoy the same Privileges, and Immunities at least, and have the like favour in all Things, as well in the Courts of Justice, as in all such things as relate either to Commerce, or to any other Right whatever, which any Foreign Nation, the most fa∣voured,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
has, uses, and enjoys, or may hereafter have, use, and enjoy.</Q></P>
<P>This Article proposes an Equality in the gene∣ral Circumstances of Trade for the Subjects of the two Nations, in their respective Dominions, with the Subjects of other Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>France</HI> shall not demand any Toll, Duty, Custom, Impost, Port-Charges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants, in any Ports or places of her Dominions, more than the Subjects of all other Nations pay in the same Ports, and <HI>Vice Versa England</HI> shall do the same.</P>
<P>I know it is objected here that this Article di∣rectly contravenes the Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> and some People lay a great Stress upon that Treaty, in which we are oblig'd to admit the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines at a certain Rate or Duty lower than the <HI>French.</HI> Whether the Parliament will think that Treaty relates to a farther Term than the Expi∣ration of the War, I shall not determine; and this is named because some insist upon it, that that Treaty was made for Considerations which wholly related to the War, and which Con∣siderations, or Conditions, on the behalf of <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> as has been mention'd in Parliament, were not honourably and punctually perform'd. <HI>Vide the Votes of the House of Commons,</HI> and Represen∣tation and Address last Session. Now, how far the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will think Her self bound by that Treaty, which, on the other hand, they say, was never perform'd, is the Question these People offer in this Case: But this I shall not take upon me to determine of here, but leave it to the Casuists in those Cases, whose Judgments
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
are founded on the Laws of Nations, and the Nature of Treaties.</P>
<P>But the Considerations of Trade are of a dif∣fering Nature; and tho' there were much more to be said for the Interest of the Kingdom, re∣specting Peace and War, than we think can be said here, yet those things weight not in Argu∣ments of Commerce: The present Enquiry is, Whether the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> Trades are of most Advantage to <HI>England?</HI> Many Arguments offer themselves to our View upon this Head, but I believe no Man will pretend to say, but that as Things stand now, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade is much more to the general Profit than the <HI>French,</HI> be∣cause, <HI>besides many other Reasons,</HI> we make ef∣fectual Exportation of our Woollen Manufa∣ctures for all the Wines, Oyles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we receive from <HI>Portugal;</HI> whereas the Obstructions in <HI>France</HI> to our Woollen Goods by the War, and the Improvements made in <HI>France,</HI> not only in our Woollen Manufactures, but in many other things, makes that Trade run in a different Chan∣nel, and the Ballance, at least, before our Stop to their Wine, Brandy, and wrought Silks, by the high Duties and Prohibitions now in force were against <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument brought against these things by those who think the Equality of Duties rea∣sonable; at least, the Argument which is most Cogent is this. It may be true, that while our Trade to <HI>France</HI> lies under the Discouragements and Disadvantages of their Tariffs of 1699, and 1701; the Loss is Ours, because we export but few of our Woollen Manufactures thither. But
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
the Question is not yet thought of, How great a Trade we may have to <HI>France,</HI> a Kingdom of so large Extent, so populous, and so wanting Ma∣nufactures of Wooll, when those high Duties are taken off, and the Tariff of 1664 restor'd, as by the Ninth Article is propos'd?</P>
<P>I shall, however, state this as impartially be∣tween both as possible. We are sure that now the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> is not only a great, but a gainful Trade, and we know it is an encreased and an encreasing Trade, also it is a Trade, <HI>as is mention'd above,</HI> especially advantageous to <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> in that our whole Import from thence is ballanc'd by our Woollen Manufacture, and great Sums brought hither, in Specie of Gold, every Year. This, as it is said, we are sure of, and it can be no Offence to any to say, we hope that when Commissioners shall meet as is provided by the Ninth Article to remove the Difficulties, and to regulate mutually the Duties and Circum∣stances of Trade, they will be very careful to prevent breaking in too far upon so beneficial a Trade as that to <HI>Portugal,</HI> before they have a clear View of making, at least an equal Advan∣tage to <HI>Britain</HI> in the Trade to <HI>France;</HI> and this may suffice to say at present upon the Affair of general Equallities in Commerce, which is the Sustance of the Eighth Article.</P>
<P>The Ninth Article requires a farther Discus∣sion, and may be particularly divided into three Periods or Heads.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The proposal of repealing the Laws on ei∣ther hand, which relate to additional Impost, and Duties on Merchandizes in both Kingdoms,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
and all the Prohibitions of Importation also, from the Year 1664.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The settling the Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Goods imported into <HI>England</HI> upon the same Foot, and at the same Rates upon which Goods of the like Nature are imported from other Parts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The appointing Commissioners not only to adjust the Exceptions and separate Proposals which are not yet settled, but to regulate the Me∣thods of future Commerce between the Nations, in such a manner as may be for mutual Advan∣tage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The two first of these are contain'd in the first Part of the Ninth Article of the Treaty, in these Words:<Q>It is further agreed, That within the space of two Months after a Law shall be made in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> whereby it shall be sufficiently provided that no more Customs or Duties be paid for Goods and Merchandizes brought from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than what are payable for Goods and Mer∣chandizes of the like Nature, Imported into <HI>Great Britain</HI> from any other Country in <HI>Europe;</HI> and that all Laws made in <HI>Great Britain</HI> since the Year 1664, for Prohibiting the Importation of any Goods and Merchandizes coming from <HI>France,</HI> which were not prohibited before that time, be repealed, the ge∣neral Tariff made in <HI>France</HI> the 18th Day of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> in the Year 1664. shall take place there again, and the Duties payable in <HI>France</HI> by the Sub∣jects of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> for Goods Imported and Exported, shall be paid according to the Tenour of the Tariff abovementioned, and shall not exceed the Rule therein settled, in the Provinces whereof men∣tion
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
is there made, and in the other Provinces the Duty shall not be payable, otherwise than according to the Rule at that time prescribed; And all Pro∣hibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees made in <HI>France</HI> since the said Tariff of the Year 1664, and contrary thereunto, in respect to the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great Britain</HI> shall be Repealed.</Q></P>
<P>To consider this with all possible Impartiali∣ty. It must be allow'd, that the <HI>French</HI> binding themselves to Repeal all their Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations or Decrees, made in <HI>France,</HI> back to the Year 1664, entitled them very justly to insist upon the same Thing with us; and were we sure that Repealing those Tariffs would open the Door to a Free Trade for our Manufacturers into <HI>France,</HI> that Demand would meet with the less Difficulties here, and the Alternative be the more just. Of which we shall say more when we come to enquire into the Excepted Articles.</P>
<P>But altho' this may seem very Just for the <HI>French</HI> to demand, yet it will require some Retrospect upon our own Circumstances, to consider whether it consists with our Trading Interest to come into this Mutual Repealing of Duties and Prohibitions; and indeed whether it be consistent with the very Nature and Being of our Trade: As particularly, the taking off the Prohibition of <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> which we call <HI>Broad Silks,</HI> and that severe Prohibition of <HI>Ala∣modes</HI> and <HI>Lustrings.</HI></P>
<P>It might require here some very mature Thoughts to reflect upon the State of our own Trade; <HI>for Example,</HI> The Encouragement given to the Making <HI>Lustrings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
and upon which the Subscribers to the <HI>Lustring-Company</HI> embark'd their Stocks was, without question, the Prohibition of the <HI>French Silks</HI> of that Kind, and the Confidence they had, that if at any time that Prohibition expired, they should obtain that Encouragement which is generally granted to all New Undertakings of that Nature, and without which they are sup∣posed not to be able to promote or set up such Works, or at least with any Success; this En∣couragement is generally the laying large Im∣positions, or actual Prohibitions, upon Goods of the same Nature made in other Countries: But if on the contrary the Impositions and Pro∣hibitions aforesaid are actually taken off, and the Trade laid open, so that the like Goods may be admitted upon low Terms from Abroad, those Undertakings are Ruin'd of meer Conse∣quence. This I take to be the Case of the <HI>Lu∣string-Company</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and I believe the Master or Members of that Company will be free to own that they can make but small Pre∣tence to the carrying on their said Trade, if the Prohibition and Duty upon the <HI>French Lustrings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes</HI> should be taken off by this Trea∣ty. What Weight the Interest of the Company shall bear in the Consideration of this Great Affair, when either the Parliament in general, or the Commissioners when nominated to enquire into it in particular, shall come to debate it, I will not undertake to determine.</P>
<P>The Case of our <HI>Broad Weavers</HI> may come next to be mention'd, in Favour of whom, and in Consideration of the Numbers of Families
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
maintain'd by the Manufacture of <HI>Silk</HI> in this Nation, the General Prohibition of <HI>French Wrought Silks</HI> first, and afterwards of <HI>East-India Wrought Silks</HI> was made. What other Conside∣rations moved the House to those Prohibitions, and how importunate the <HI>Weavers</HI> and Importers of <HI>Silk</HI> were to obtain those Prohibitions, is too fresh in the Memories of all Men who think of these Things, that I need not repeat any thing of it here: What a Hurt it will be to the <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> I rather leave to the People concern'd to talk of, who are apt to be loud enough, than to pretend to meddle with it here.</P>
<P>It is argued here, that the Encrease of the Exportation of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> will follow, by taking off the high Duties in <HI>France,</HI> by which that whole Nation will be open to our Sale, and we shall Export vast Quantities thi∣ther Yearly; I say, if this be urged as a thing of such Weight, to which the Loss in the <HI>Silk Manufactures, &amp;c.</HI> is not to be compared, <HI>I rea∣dily yield to it,</HI> only with this Proviso, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that we are certain that Exportation shall so increase. I shall allow my self to hope it will do so, at least if the Commissioners, who are to meet, can bring the <HI>French</HI> to consent that the <HI>English Woollen Manufactures</HI> be comprised in the Treaty, and the Duties upon them be re∣duced to the Tariff of 1664. Nor will I allow that to be a Question in the Case, since the known Interest of their Country so much re∣quires it, and the Ruin or Damage to other parts of our Trade will be so just an Equiva∣lent.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
But as that Notion of the Increase of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> is an Answer to the Na∣tion in general, so here may be an Answer sug∣gested to the <HI>Broad Silk Weavers</HI> and <HI>Lustring-Company</HI> in particular, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That altho' the Prohibitions be taken off, yet still there seems to be a liberty left to <HI>Britain,</HI> by this <HI>Ninth Article,</HI> to continue or lay any higher Duty on such Foreign <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> as the Government shall think needful, to encourage our <HI>Silk Ma∣nufactures,</HI> and yet the <HI>French</HI> be obliged to Re∣peal their high Duties at the same time. This, I say, seems plain at least to our common view, who can judge of these Things but without doors, from these two Circumstances.</P>
<P>1. From the Demand the <HI>French</HI> make of keeping four Species of Goods up to the Rule of the Tariff of 1699, which if they insist upon, there seems to be a Parity of Reason that our Commissioners may insist upon the like advance of a Duty on the <HI>Wrought Silks</HI> made in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> (1.) Because the Reason of the <HI>French</HI> for holding up their Duties on our <HI>Woollen Ma∣nufactures</HI> to the Tariff of 1699, is the very same which we would give for Laying a Duty on their <HI>Silks; (viz.)</HI> the giving the Manufa∣ctures at Home the Advantage against those which are Imported from Abroad, and encou∣raging the proper Subjects of each Kingdom. (2.) Because it does not contradict the Letter of the Treaty to Lay any new or high Duties or Customs upon the Goods and Merchandizes of any Kind Imported from <HI>France,</HI> provided it is no more than is paid upon Goods of the
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
like Nature Imported from other Parts; and I must grant, that if this Construction of the Ar∣ticle will hold, as I hope and believe it will, the Prohibitions may be all Taken off of the <HI>Broad Silks, Lustrings, Alamodes,</HI> &amp;c. without such Ruin and Destruction to the <HI>Broad Silk Weaving</HI> and <HI>Lustring Trade</HI> as has been appre∣hended. But as the Ministry on both sides must be allowed the Construction of their own Terms, and to explain their own Thoughts to one ano∣ther, so it may not be proper to anticipate all the Thoughts our Commissioners may have, least it prepare the Enemy to oppose them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are no more to be look'd upon in Trade as they formerly were, <HI>(viz)</HI> as an Improving and Encroaching People in respect to the General Commerce of <HI>Europe,</HI> but as a Nation arriv'd to such an Improvement, that they are really our Rivals in the best and great∣est Part of our Trade in particular, I mean the <HI>Woollen Manufacture.</HI> Indeed we have the good Fortune to be on the better side of the Hedge with them, and they have the Difficulty of the Want of Materials to struggle with, <HI>(viz.) the WOOLL.</HI> But then against that, by their Art, dexterous Management, Money, and other Helps, joined to the Baseness and Treachery of our own People, who for Private Gain will set their Hands to the Ruin of their Country, They have found the way, in spight of severe Laws, strict Guards, and the utmost Vigilance of Officers, to get so great Quantities of our <HI>Wooll</HI> conveyed over to <HI>France,</HI> as sufficiently enables them, in Conjunction with <HI>Spanish Wooll</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>Wooll</HI> from <HI>Barbary,</HI> to make a very great Quan∣tity of <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> and thereby do us an Inestimable Damage in our Trade; and which is yet more, as the People are Poor, Industrious, and work very low; where they are able to make the Goods at all, they are sure to underwork and undersell us.</P>
<P>For this Reason it must be allow'd, that if the <HI>French</HI> can be brought to open a Door for a free Trade, that is, for an Importation of our <HI>Wool∣len Manufactures</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> with moderate Du∣ties, the Value and Gooodness of our <HI>Manu∣factures</HI> would force their own way so far, at least, that the Advance they make upon us in those things would not be so great, or encrease so fast: In order then to come to such a free Trade, many things may be thought on, and it may be counted rational, that <HI>England</HI> should grant all they can be suppos'd to grant, and take every Step that can conduce to that main End and Design, which they can take and grant without Prejudice to their own Nation, and to the main Trade thereof, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> in some other Branch; for to do thus, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to yeild what would be fatal to it in another Part, would be to build with one Hand, and pull down with another.</P>
<P>This brings us then to the second Head, men∣tion'd above.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The settling the Duties upon</HI> French <HI>Goods, upon an Equality with the Duties on Goods of the like Nature imported from foreign Coun∣tries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
This, <HI>as is noted above,</HI> signifies not at all, <HI>as I can understand it,</HI> an entire Reduction of our Impost and Customs upon <HI>French</HI> Goods, or as the Article at first View seem'd to suggest, and as many still understand it to take off all our new Impositions since the Year 1664, but rather an Agreement with <HI>France,</HI> that as Peace is restor'd between the two Nations, and they stand to one another upon an Equality of general Interest, in the same relation <HI>of Neighbourhood</HI> one to ano∣ther, so they should <HI>of Trade</HI> also; and the Equa∣lity of Duties upon Goods of like Sort, I laid down as the Foundation of this Equality. Those who are of Opinion that an Equality of all Na∣tions in Trade is requisite, must produce other Arguments to back that Opinion than I'have seen yet, unless by Equalities they will make suitable Allowances for tie different Scituations of Coun∣tries, Quality of Goods, and Circumstances of Trade.</P>
<P>Now let others put what Construction they will upon the Ninth Article, and upon the Meaning of those Words, <HI>the same Duties,</HI> and <HI>Goods of like nature,</HI> I must be allow'd to think that it is implied that Allowances and Regulations must be made, in order to bring the Nature of Things <HI>to be like,</HI> and the Duties to <HI>be the same;</HI> Things may be said to <HI>be the same,</HI> when by just Allow∣ances and Proportions they are regulated and ad∣justed, and brought to an Equality; on the con∣trary, tho' the Sum paid upon any Goods <HI>be the same,</HI> yet it may give one Side a great Inequality and Advantage over the other; and that which is the same thing in the Letter, is not the same in the Consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
These are things cannot be reason'd upon so well before hand, as they will be debated and cal∣culated upon a Personal Treaty with Commis∣sioners, and therefore, I say, no Judgment can be made at present by a common Eye: But that every Body may judge a little what may be the State of our Trade, when this Door of Inter∣course and Commerce is open'd, it may not be improper to look back, and see what the Trade was formerly, and to know thereby what we are like to expect, when the high Duties are taken off from the <HI>French</HI> Goods here.</P>
<P>It is true, that Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> in his Report, from the Books of the <HI>Custom-House</HI> to the Com∣missioners, named in the Act for taking, exa∣mining, and stating the Publick Accounts, ob∣serves, that in the Four Years Interval of Peace, at the latter End of King <HI>William,</HI> we exported to <HI>France</HI> only thus, <HI>that is to say,</HI> in our <HI>Wool∣len Manufactures</HI> only.</P>

small, if the Doctor's Valuation of those Goods are right.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, in a Representation of Trade and Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> made to the late King, by his Majesty's Especial Com∣mand, Dated <HI>December</HI> 23. 1697, by the Com∣missioners of Trade, as I have been inform'd there was given in the following terrible Abstract of the <HI>French</HI> Trade with <HI>England, viz.:</HI><LIST>

To descend to farther Particulars: They say that in the Year 1685, there was Twenty Thou∣sand Tons of <HI>Wine,</HI> and Six Thousand Tons of <HI>Brandy,</HI> Imported into <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> and more especially, that from . . . . . <HI>Anno</HI> 1688, to . . . . 1689, there was upwards of the said Quantity of Twenty Thousand Tons of <HI>Wine,</HI> and Six Thousand Tons of <HI>Brandy,</HI> Im∣ported.</P>
<P>It would be Unjust, at this time of day, to let such Accounts as these lye open for every one to pass their Judgments of, without giving the Opinion of him that publishes them, be∣cause the Reason and Design of the making them publick will very much lye in the giving, or not giving, that Opinion; and therefore I think my self bound to own, that I do not look on the said Account to have any Foundation in the Matter of Fact, or in the Nature of the Thing: And therefore as it does not Comport with the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Books of those Years, so neither does it to me appear Reasonable. Howbeit being given in to the late King by such Persons so qualified to know, and who were under such Obligations to do it exactly, I shall say no more to it but this, That no Man need go any farther for a Reason why the late King appear'd very backward, after the Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> to enter upon any Treaty of Com∣merce with <HI>France,</HI> or to open the same by Tak∣ing off the said high Duties, which at that time and 'till now have been as a Prohibition on both sides.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
And I cannot wonder, why any Man who may have drawn his Calculate of Things from these Estimates, should be of the same mind now; for certain it is, that no Export which we can hope for of our Woollen Manufactures to <HI>France,</HI> can ever come up to Balance such an Account as this, nay, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> were willing to Take off and Revoke all his Ta∣riffs to 1664, and the Tariff of 1664 too.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the <HI>Custom-House</HI> Books make it appear, as is also to be seen in the said Report of Dr. <HI>Davenant,</HI> that the whole Im∣port of <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> in the Year from <HI>Mi∣chaelmass</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelmass</HI> 1669, came out thus;<TABLE>

</TABLE> Which it seems was plac'd to the Balance of Trade, just as the Inclination of the People pleased to lead them: Some reckoned it at the Rate, or Price, which the <HI>Wine</HI> Cost in <HI>France,</HI> which I must acknowledge is the true way to state the Balance between the Trade of the Two Kingdoms; because in Estimating our Exports to <HI>France,</HI> we always reckon the Value of those Exports, being of our own Goods, at the Worth here, and can do no otherwise: But others willing to make the Sum appear big, Ra∣ted or Valued them at the Price <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> was Sold for by the Retailer in <HI>England.</HI> In which Valuations the Difference was as follows: The first Rated the <HI>Wine</HI> at 8<HI>l. per</HI> Ton, and

the <HI>Brandy</HI> at 9<HI>l. per</HI> Ton; the other at 36<HI>l.</HI> and 45<HI>l.</HI> By the first the Rate was thus: <TABLE>

<P>This makes a manifest Difference, and shews that we ought, upon very good Examination, to take the Calculations of other People in these Cases, who always speak as their Party Opinions guide them: However, take it which way we will, it is apparent, that after this the Quantity of <HI>Wine</HI> in general Imported from all <HI>France,</HI> and from other Countries too, in∣creased prodigiously; for whereas during the Years 1668 and 1669, as abovesaid, when we Imported Six Thousand Tons of <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> there was then no Impor∣tation at all of <HI>Wine</HI> from <HI>Portugal;</HI> or if there was, the <HI>Custom-House</HI> knew it by no other Name than of <HI>Spanish Wines,</HI> which might in∣deed be the Case; and those <HI>Spanish Wines</HI> a∣mounted the same Year to 6343 Tons: So that
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
the general Import of <HI>Wine</HI> in <HI>England, Anno</HI> 1669, was 12069 Tons; the same General Ac∣count about the Year 1699 or 1700, was one Year with another near 19000 Tons. In Par∣ticular thus Entred: <TABLE>

<P>How much of this Wine shall in a future Trade be imported from <HI>France,</HI> is hard to determine; some alledge the whole Draught of Red Wines will come from thence; but this is running too far and too fast, for even before the War, tho' the Duties of <HI>French</HI> Wines were much lower than the Duties of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Wines, yet there were always great Quantities of <HI>Alicant, Florence, Bar a Bar,</HI> and <HI>Oporto</HI> Wines brought in, which, by reason of the deepness and bright∣ness, of the Colour or Face of the Wines, were always found useful by the <HI>Vintners</HI> to draw with their thin meaner <HI>French</HI> Wines, and sold at a much greater Price; and if, as sometimes it hap∣pen'd, the Vintage in <HI>France</HI> fail'd, or the Wines prov'd small and ill colour'd, the Quantity and Price of the Wines from <HI>Lisbon, Oporto, Alicant, &amp;c.</HI> always encreas'd in Proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
If this was the Case then, when the Duties of those other Wines were about 7<HI>l. per</HI> Ton grea∣ter than the Duties of the <HI>French,</HI> we may rea∣sonably hope it will be still so, and with more Ad∣vantage to the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines, when the Duties of the <HI>French</HI> Wines shall be made Equal.</P>
<P>But here comes in an Objection, which was hinted at before, upon the Subject of what you will call Equality, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Alicant, Florence,</HI> and <HI>Lisbon</HI> Wines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> come in here at a grea∣ter Expence, both in their first Cost, as also in their Freight, Cask, length of the Voyage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than the <HI>French;</HI> and thus, therefore, if the <HI>French</HI> Wines pay but an equal Duty, yet the Trade is not thereby put upon an Equality, but the Ad∣vantage given to the <HI>French,</HI> and that a Propor∣tion ought to be stated here, to bring this Matter to an Equality.</P>
<P>This may have some Weight in it, and as I can do no more than mention it here, so I cannot prevail upon my self to doubt but the Govern∣ment will take Care to have the Disproportion consider'd in the further Debates they are to have of that Affair.</P>
<P>As to the Treaties with <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the Conditions to be perform'd in that part of the Case with the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> they are not for a Subject to dispute, but must be left to the Consideration of Parliament, to whom it be∣longs, and who no doubt will do what is requi∣site in that Case.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine a little into that part of the Ninth Article which speaks of the
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
excepted Species of Goods, and of appointing Commissaries to regulate the Duties and Diffe∣rences of those Species, according to the Tenor of the other part of the Agreement: This is contained in the following words of the Article it self, (viz.) <Q>But whereas it is urged on the Part of <HI>France,</HI> that certain Merchandizes, that is to say, Manufactures of Wooll, Sugar, Salted Fish, and the Product of Whales be excepted out of the Rule of the above-mentioned Tariff, and likewise other Heads of Matters belonging to this Treaty remain, which having been proposed on the part of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have not yet been mutually adjust∣ed, a Specification of all which is contained in a separate Instrument Subscribed by the Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries on both sides; It is hereby Provided and Agreed, that within two Months from the Exchange of the Ratifications of this Treaty, Commissaries on both sides shall meet at <HI>London,</HI> to consider of, and remove the Diffi∣culties concerning the Merchandizes to be excepted out of the Tariff of the Year 1664, and concern∣ing the other Heads, which, as is abovesaid, are not yet wholly adjusted. And at the same time the said Commissaries shall likewise endeavour, (which seems to be very much for the Interest of both Nations) to have the Methods of Commerce on one part, and of the other, more thoroughly ex∣amined, and to find out and establish just and be∣neficial means on both sides for removing the Diffi∣culties in this matter, and for regulating the Du∣ties mutually. But it is always understood and provided, that all and singular the Articles of this Treaty, do in the mean while remain in their full
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
force, and especially that nothing be deemed, under any Pretence whatsoever, to hinder the benefit of the General Tariff of the Year 1664, from being granted to the Subjects of Her Royal Majesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the said <HI>British</HI> Subjects from having and enjoying the same, without any Delay or Tergiversation, within the space of two Months after a Law is made in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as above∣said, in as ample manner and form as the Subjects of any Nation, the most favoured, might have and enjoy the benefit of the aforesaid Tariff, any thing to be done, or discussed by the said Commis∣saries, to the contrary in any wise notwithstand∣ing.</Q></P>
<P>It seems here that the four Species of Goods mentioned, <HI>(viz.) Fish,</HI> produce of <HI>Whale,</HI> that is, <HI>Whale Fins</HI> and <HI>Oyl, Sugar</HI> Refin'd, and <HI>Woollen Maenufactures,</HI> shall be excepted out of this Ar∣ticle; that is to say, out of the Tariff of 1664: But what then, say we, signify all the rest, for our Woollen Manufacture is the main thing which we have to insist upon, if this should not be adjusted then the whole Trade is gone? It is to be hoped, that the Wisdom of our Parlia∣ment will provide, That unless such a Method may be found out that our Manufactures may be admitted into <HI>France</HI> upon such Terms as will make them Vendible there, and that they may not only come to Market, but may have a Market to come to where they will be Sold, they will be very Cautious how they make a Law to Take off our high Duties and Prohibi∣tions upon the <HI>French</HI> Goods; for this would
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
be to Ruin us effectually, by admitting <HI>French</HI> Goods of all kinds into <HI>England,</HI> and having our Woollen Manufactures, in effect, prohi∣bited.</P>
<P>The great Question then is, What is the Tariff of 1699, which the Articles make men∣tion of, and what is the Difference between that and 1664? And to Answer this directly it is to be understood, that there is no such thing in <HI>France</HI> as a Tariff of 1699, that respects <HI>English</HI> Goods, other than that mentioned before made with <HI>Holland,</HI> by which the <HI>English</HI> Fine Broad Cloth is Taxed at 20 Livres for 25 Ells <HI>French, (viz.)</HI> for about 30 to 31 Yards more than they were Charged before, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by the Tariff of 1664, and Serges, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in proportion. This Addition is the Thing upon which it seems turns the Question between a Trade and no Trade with <HI>France.</HI> If this Addition will effect a Prohibition, the King of <HI>France</HI> cannot insist upon it when he proposes a Treaty of Trade; for that would be to have us open our Trade to him, and shut up his Trade from us: But if the <HI>French</HI> King is in Earnest to seek a Treaty of Commerce with us, then the Difference be∣tween the Tariff of 1664 and 1699 is so little, that he cannot scruple to give it up: Besides, as by the Eighth Article, <Q>the Subjects of <HI>Britain</HI> are to enjoy all those Privileges, Liberties and Immu∣nities, and have the like favour in all things as to all Duties, Impositions or Customs whatsoever, con∣cerning Persons, Goods and Merchandizes, which any Foreign Nation, the most favour'd, enjoys, or may hereafter have, use and enjoy.</Q> If this, I say,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
be agreed, then it will remain to enquire, How the Treaties of Commerce with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and other Nations have settled this Affair, as to Salted Fish and Woollen Manufactures; for as to the Produce of Whales it concerns us little, who have no Whale Fishing; and as to Fish, the <HI>Dutch</HI> also are the main Parties concern'd: But as to the Woollen Manufacture, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> have yielded that Point, then we seem to be stop'd by the Eighth Article from asking any more; and how far that may consist with the Sale of our Manufactures in <HI>France</HI> remains to be Examined, and we may hope will be effe∣ctually Debated before it be yielded to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Debate which the respective Commissa∣ries to be appointed are to have, as the Article says <HI>for the Interest of both Nations,</HI> will no question be very agreeable to all Honest Men, if it may be so adjusted as that our Woollen Manufactures may meet with no Interruption in their Exportation to <HI>France.</HI> No question, there may be such Regulations of Commerce made as may be for the Interest of both Na∣tions, but all must be with a supposition of ad∣mitting our Manufactures into <HI>France</HI> upon Equal and Reasonable Terms; which if it be not done, our Trade is rather prohibited than extended, rather shut up than opened; so that upon this one Article all the rest depends, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Trade be open'd for our Woollen Goods in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>How else shall we make our selves amends for the Loss of our Trade in <HI>Portugal?</HI> I shall say nothing here to the Obligation upon Her Ma∣jesty
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
to the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> the Government will no doubt concern themselves to preserve the Conditions of every Agreement with the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> from any Clashing Incon∣sistencies one with another: No more will I un∣dertake to say the <HI>Portugueze</HI> wait to prohibit our Manufactures as soon as they shall hear this Transaction is settled; I do not believe the <HI>Portugueze</HI> so weak neither: We are told, this will be most certain, that whatever amends we may make our selves by the <HI>French</HI> Trade, we shall certainly lessen our Wine Trade from <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> and to also from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and other parts, to whom we at the same time send very large Quantities of our Manufactures; and therefore if the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> do not make up the Diminution of those Trades, it will not then be an Equivalent to us for the Exchange. But we hope the Commissioners, who are to meet upon this Subject, will concern themselves to weigh this part also, and so to admit the <HI>French</HI> Trade, that the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> may not be in a worse Case than it was before the War. Indeed it must be Own'd, it would be hard to suggest that the Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> can be in a worse state than it was before the War; when it is known that before the War, the whole Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Wines were not more than 8<HI>l.</HI> or thereabout <HI>per Ton;</HI> and at the same time the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines paid above 16<HI>l.</HI> 8<HI>s.</HI> Duty: And beyond the Years 1664, we do not find any Wines import∣ed from <HI>Portugal</HI> at all, but under the Title of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wines; which may be noted, not that there came no Wines from <HI>Portugal</HI> at all; but
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
that <HI>Portugal</HI> was then under the Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> 'till the Revolt of the Duke of <HI>Braganza,</HI> the Grandfather of the Present King: I say then it can hardly be rational to think the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade will be quite sunk, or that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> will prohibit Trade with us; but that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines paying the same Dutys, the first will gain the pre∣ference at Market, no body will question; and therefore it had been to be wished, there had been some little reserv'd advantage to the Trade of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine: But since it is otherwise deter∣min'd, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade must take its Fate; and all that remains seems to be the taking a due Care, that the Trade to <HI>France</HI> for our Ma∣nufactures may be so enlarged, as may be a Recompence for what may happen on the other side; and if this may but appear, we shall have reason to be the better satisfy'd with the Trea∣ty of Commerce; and we shall all be glad to find it so, that the Complaints of those, who pretend to fear, nay to know (as they say) the contrary, may appear to have been without ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> is next to be considered; the <HI>Lustring Company</HI> is now near expiring, and their Charter, which was granted for <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Years, is almost run out; whether they will obtain a New Charter or no is not for us to enquire, whatever we may suppose; but whe∣ther they shall or not, it may be the same thing; the Prohibition, or Duty equal to a Prohibition, upon <HI>Lustrings</HI> and <HI>Alamodes,</HI> if it is to remain, as by the Equality with other Nations mentioned
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
in the Treaty, it may, makes a very great Dif∣ference in the Manufacture at home, and the Importation from abroad; whether the <HI>Lustring-Company</HI> can go on or no, is for them to deter∣mine: But it must be own'd, that if the Dutys on Foreign <HI>Lustrings</HI> are held up at about 35<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> more than the Manufactures of <HI>Lu∣strings</HI> at home are valued at, and the <HI>Lustring-Company</HI> cannot go on, but the Foreign will out∣sell them, the making them at home must sink under the Imperfections of the Performance, rather than under the mistake of the Treaty of Commerce.</P>
<P>It is true, a Man, who has any Value for the Trade of his Native Country, cannot but regret the misfortune of the Humour of our People in <HI>Britain,</HI> who are so far from Encouraging the Manufactures of their own Country, that they will upon all Occasions, and almost in all Cases, choose any thing to wear that comes from abroad, and advance in price for such Goods, without regard to the real Goodness or Worth of the thing they buy, meerly upon its being Foreign. This puts all Manufacturing, at least of Silks, under very great Discouragements, and fre∣quently has defeated the End and Design of ma∣ny wholesome and good Laws, which have been made for the Encouragement of our own People; and it is feared, this will still be a help to the <HI>French</HI> Interest in Trade, when our Duties on their Goods shall be reduced to an Equality with the Goods and Merchandises of other Countries; It is true, that this is a Mischief that ought, if it were possible, rather to be punished than
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
Encouraged; but still while this is our Misfor∣tune, and we cannot help it, the Government may provide as well against it in Treaties and Capitulations, as the Nature of such things will admit.</P>
<P>How far it can be expected, that the Ministers of State should in Treaties of Peace and Com∣merce allow for these National Follies, I will not meddle with here; it is most certain, that if this Humour of our People prevails after the present Treaty, they may defeat the best Designs of the Government in the Treaty, and make that mischievous, which otherwise would not be so: We had an Eminent Example of this Hu∣mour of the People, in the Extravagance of their Fancy after the <HI>Painted Callicoes</HI> and <HI>Fine Chints</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which run on to so ridicu∣lous an Extreme, that on a sudden you saw all the Ladies of Quality, and wealthy Citizens Wives, dress'd up in a Tawdry piece of <HI>Callicoe,</HI> which but a few Years before, their Chamber-Maids would have thought beneath them to be seen in: Nor was this all, but immediately by the same Rule our Velvet and Damask-beds, fine Window-curtains, nay the very Hangings of Rooms, were all turn'd into <HI>Painted Callicoes</HI> and <HI>Meslepatan Chints,</HI> to the entire Destruction, if it had gone on, of the <HI>Silk Manufacture,</HI> and the exceeding Damage of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> also: There was no Remedy for this Distemper, <HI>(for no doubt it was a Distemper in our People)</HI> but to quash it at once by an immediate Prohibition of all <HI>East-India Silks</HI> and <HI>Painted Callicoes,</HI> and forbidding the wearing and making them up,
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
upon the severest Penalties that could be though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of.</P>
<P>I should have observed, that as the Humou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for <HI>East-India</HI> Goods began at the <HI>Chints</HI> and <HI>Painted Callicoes,</HI> so as they began to grow fami¦liar, the Ladies went on to the <HI>Wrought Silks</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> and to wear fine <HI>Atlasses,</HI> Rich <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver Stuffs,</HI> and fine <HI>Damasks;</HI> and this to that degree, that the <HI>Company</HI> Imported Nine Thousand Pieces of Rich <HI>Damasks</HI> in one Ship: Nay even in furnishing our Houses, the <HI>Indian</HI> Pictures, in themselves simple, ordinary and ridiculous, became more valuable than the Finest Paintings of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>These Things are mentioned here for this rea∣son, to note, that since our Fancies are thus de∣bauch'd; if possible then, whatever Treaties of Commerce are made, as much Provision ought also to be made, as the Nature of the Thing will permit, to prevent the ill Consequences of it in our Trade.</P>
<P>It is very well known, that the like Excess in the Humour and Temper of our People has for many Years past appear'd in their Extravagant Passion for every thing that is <HI>French,</HI> as well in Wearing Apparel, <HI>Silks,</HI> &amp;c. as in <HI>Wines;</HI> and if the Extravagance should now return to possess our Fancy, when the <HI>French</HI> Trade opens by this New Treaty, we may ruin our own Trade in spight of the best Conditions and Articles in the World. As an Exhortation against this Humour in the People would be of greater Use in the main, than all possible Exclamation can be against the Treaty, so it cannot be offensive to any one
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
to say, that this will necessarily move the Go∣vernment, when they shall treat by the New Commissioners, which the Treaty allows, that such Dutys may be kept up upon Foreign <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> or added if need be, as will give our <HI>En∣glish Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Silk</HI> a sufficient preference, and cause those People, who will still be for <HI>French</HI> Goods, to see the Madness and Distracti∣on of their Fancy, and how dear they must pay or worse Goods than they may have at home.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but such Measures would in Time give a shock to the Mischief, and perhaps in Time take off our People from the Extrava∣vagance and Folly, which has formerly done them so much Harm in Trade, and is still so dangerous in the Case before us.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are an Industrious People; they work cheap, and work well; their Fancy in contriving Fashions, Figures and Fancies in their Work, is very bright and quick, and these Things recommend their Goods to us; the Vanity and Levity of their Nation prompts them to apply to all the Novelties and Niceties of Dress; they gratify the Beaus and the Ladies, and this leads us insensibly into the Error, and makes our Peo∣ple infinitely fond of their Trade. If then the Commissaries, who are to meet and regulate the Trade, do not state the Duties on <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> &amp;c. so as to give a very great Difference to the <HI>English Wrought Silk,</HI> so as that they may not be discouraged in their Work, and the Humour for every thing that is <HI>French</HI> again prevail, our Home-Trade will be ruin'd of Course, and by its own Friends, even the very People who ought to support and carry it on.</P>

<P>These Dutys the <HI>French</HI> may still be obliged to pay, because all other Nations pay the same: Nay, if our Articles are rightly managed, and the Parliament thinks fit to lay any other and higher Dutys on the said Species of <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> so be it, that other Nations pay the same Dutys upon Goods of the like Nature.</P>
<P>It is humbly recommended then to those, in whose Hands Power is or shall be lodg'd to do these Things, that they would consider the many Thousand Families of our Poor, as well <HI>Weavers</HI> as others, who depend upon the <HI>Silk Manufac∣tures</HI> in this Nation; as also the Great and truly Beneficial Trade to <HI>Turkey</HI> and the <HI>Levant,</HI> from whence our <HI>Silk</HI> is chiefly Imported, and to pur∣chase which, our <HI>Broad Cloth</HI> is sent in such great Quantities, as to make a very considerable Figure also in the Employment of our People in the Country; all which must sink in a very great Degree, if some immediate Care is not taken, and Means used to keep up the Value of our own <HI>Broad Silks,</HI> and keep down and discourage, as much as may be, the Importation of <HI>French Silks,</HI> upon this New Opening of the Trade.</P>
<P>This is the rather urged now, because it is evident that there is room very happily made in
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
the Treaty for it, and that at the same time that we apprehend the Danger, we yet can with Satisfaction so far Compliment the Makers of this Treaty, in that they have left room for so advantageous a Step to be taken in favour of the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and <HI>Workers</HI> of <HI>Silk;</HI> and that by the Treaty it may be done, since, as above, the <HI>French</HI> scruple not our high Duties at all, only desire that they may pay no more than other Nations, which if it be Granted them can do us no Harm, provided that both they and all other Nations may but be obliged to pay so much, that we may be able to go on with our Trade at Home.</P>
<P>This is not said by way of Complaint against any thing agreed on in the Treaty: The Danger does not seem to be in what is done, and Agreed on by the Treaty, but from what may yet be done in Consequence of the Treaty; and there∣fore it is, that this Case is insisted on.</P>
<P>We have seen very large Accounts Published of the Importations of <HI>Foreign Silks</HI> from <HI>France:</HI> Dr. <HI>Davenant</HI> in his Report to the Commissioners of Accounts says, that the Commissioners of Trade in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time gave his Majesty an Account, that the Importations from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>England</HI> only, amounted in Value in this one Article of <HI>Wrought Silks</HI> to <HI>l.</HI>300,000 <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>By a Scheme of the Trade to <HI>France</HI> now Printed and handed about, the same is Calculated for the Year 1674,<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>At 150,000 lb. weight of <HI>Wrought Silk,</HI></CELL>

<CELL><HI>l.</HI> 300,000</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
It is noted in the same Scheme, that there was recieved at the Port of <HI>Dover</HI> that Year <HI>l.</HI>15000 for the Dutys on <HI>French Wrought Silks,</HI> besides what may be supposed to be run there that Year.</P>
<P>It is not material for us to examine into the Truth of these Accounts: Nay, tho' they should be allowed to be Fictitious and False, as I believe they are.—But it will be allowed that the Quan∣tity was very great; and it is Humbly Offered to the Consideration of those whom it concerns to weigh from hence, How great a Consumption of the <HI>Silk Manufacture</HI> this Nation makes, and consequently how well worthy their Concern it is, that as much of this as is possible, might be manufactur'd by our own Hands, and the Trade be kept among our selves.</P>
<P>It is true, as the Dutys are now, <HI>(viz.)</HI> 12<HI>l.</HI> for every 20<HI>l.</HI> or 12<HI>s. per</HI> Pound Duty on the said <HI>Wrought Silks,</HI> it is a very great Difference; but as this comes to be reckoned upon the Mea∣sure, it does not, especially in midling slight <HI>Silks,</HI> amount to much by the Yard; and suppose it was one Shilling, or Two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Yard, it is too well known that the Humour of our La∣dies, when they are buying Fine Cloths, and are wheedled with the Opinion of the Fineness and Goodness of <HI>French Silks,</HI> is not to be restrain'd by a Shilling, Two or Three in a Yard.</P>
<P>If then the Duties were enlarged upon the sine Wrought <HI>Silks</HI> to such a Degree, that the Weav∣ing of <HI>Broad Silks</HI> and Rich <HI>Brocaded Silks</HI> in <HI>Britain</HI> may not be discouraged, such a Treaty of Commerce will be a happy means to prevent
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
the Ruin of our Trade, the starving many Thou∣sands of Poor Familys, and the <HI>French</HI> Trade may not be so prejudicial to us in that particular Trade, as otherwise there is reason to fear. It might be offered at to set down what Addition of Duty would be sufficient to preserve our Trade in this Case; but I rather choose to omit that, than prescribe to our Legislature: The <HI>Weavers</HI> are of Age; ask them, they are the best Judges.</P>
<P>The like Argument, and with the same Force, will hold good in the <HI>Linnen Manufacture,</HI> espe∣cially since two great Events, both which have happened since the Commencement of the late War.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Scotland.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Prohibiting the Exportation of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> and the encouraging the making of <HI>Linnen</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Both these Countrys are now employed, at least very considerably, in <HI>Linnen Manufactures,</HI> and it is not to be doubted, but that we are and ought to be very justly concern'd for the Encou∣ragement of them both. Now if the aforesaid Printed Accounts of Importations from <HI>France</HI> are true for the Year 1674, which however I must own I do not Credit, yet thus far they serve to argue in this Case, that the <HI>Linnen Manufacture</HI> of <HI>France</HI> is very considerable.</P>
<P>That Account stands thus; <TABLE>

<P>It is without any Question, that the <HI>Canvas,</HI> the <HI>Dowlas</HI> and the <HI>Diaper</HI> may in a little Time come to be all made in <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> the <HI>Diaper</HI> is already improved to such a Degree, as nothing can be better: And it is Humbly ho∣ped, that the Dutys which may be still added upon the <HI>French Linnen</HI> will be such, as shall prevent the Discouragement upon these <HI>Manu∣factures.</HI></P>
<P>This, we think, is the only way to make the Articles of Commerce effectual to the Advantage of <HI>Britain,</HI> and to enable us to Trade with <HI>France</HI> for the Future, upon as good Terms as we do with other Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
