<HEAD>LINES WRITTEN IN THE <HI>ALBUM,</HI> at COSSEY-HALL, NORFOLK.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>THOU, to whose sacred page the parting guest</L>
<L>Confides the workings of his grateful breast,</L>
<L>With awful pleasure o'er thy form I bend</L>
<L>My gift to bring—as brother, guest, and friend.</L>
<L>Farewell, ye shades! (ah! not to fame unknown)</L>
<L>Where Elegance has rear'd her attic throne:</L>
<L>Whose beauties, to the pure of taste address'd,</L>
<L>In Nature's charms munificently dress'd;</L>
<L>Whose soft amenity, with grace combin'd,</L>
<L>Display the emblem of the master's mind:</L>
<L>Farewell!—Say, shall I not regret the bow'r</L>
<L>Where social intercourse endear'd the hour;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4"/>
Where she, whose footsteps bless this sylvan seat,</L>
<L>The pride and mistress of this calm retreat,</L>
<L>Her soul illum'd with Wisdom's piercing beam,</L>
<L>Sheds o'er the converse her enlight'ning gleam?</L>
<L>By native Taste, that sure directress, led,</L>
<L>She stores her talents at the fountain-head.</L>
<L>So the bright Sun-flow'r, on the cultur'd plain,</L>
<L>Aspires impatient o'er her sister train,</L>
<L>Unfolds her bosom at the dawn of day</L>
<L>To catch the radiance of the solar ray.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Ye scenes o'er which I cast a ling'ring view,</L>
<L>O'er which affection breathes a warm adieu,</L>
<L>That hour I now recall with pleasing pain,</L>
<L>Which gave your beauties to my wish again:</L>
<L>Yet then, as I approach'd your smiling shore,</L>
<L>Prompt expectation gladly flew before:</L>
<L>Wing'd with gay hope, as nearer still I drew,</L>
<L>Hills, plains, and woods assum'd a brighter hue:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5"/>
Soft-wreath'd in lilac vestment, laughing May</L>
<L>With hailing aspect met me on the way:</L>
<L>The various vale with eager steps I press'd,</L>
<L>Praise on my tongue, and transport in my breast:</L>
<L>O'er each lov'd spot I sent a fond survey,</L>
<L>Where in the morn of life I wont to stray;</L>
<L>The winding walks by memory endear'd,</L>
<L>Where with the growing plants my youth was rear'd,</L>
<L>Embow'ring shades, in whos deep gloom immers'd</L>
<L>Reflection fed me, and the muses nurs'd,</L>
<L>And, screening from my view ambition's sky,</L>
<L>Pour'd other visions on my raptur'd eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Yet, Album, ere the willing task I leave,</L>
<L>Warm from the heart these closing lines receive.</L>
<L>'Twas at the hour to contemplation due,</L>
<L>When evening meekly from the world withdrew,</L>
<L>Beneath an aged oak, in pensive mood,</L>
<L>I Sorrow's solitary captive stood;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6"/>
When, from the rifted trunk's obscure recess,</L>
<L>A voice breath'd forth in accents of distress;</L>
<L>"Where! where is she of mild and rev'rend mien,</L>
<L>"Once the lov'd mistress of this sylvan scene?"—</L>
<L>"Fall'n—fall'n—fall'n—fall'n"—a distant voice replied:</L>
<L>The branches shook, as if to sense allied;</L>
<L>Wild Terror flung his strong enchantment round,</L>
<L>And evening hurried into night profound!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now fond remembrance turns a willing sight,</L>
<L>To dwell on gayer scenes of past delight,</L>
<L>Pleas'd to behold her, midst the polish'd train,</L>
<L>With grace, with dignity, her part sustain.</L>
<L>To mild festivity by nature prone,</L>
<L>With inbred with peculiarly her own,</L>
<L>Prompt ev'ry sportive incident to seize,</L>
<L>Diffusing pleasure with a careless ease;</L>
<L>Of pow'r to charm invincibly possess'd,</L>
<L>Unfelt she glided into every breast.</L>
<L>There are, who, fram'd with an enlighten'd taste,</L>
<L>High on the critic form by judgment plac'd,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
Who (marking well her sense with strength combin'd,</L>
<L>The scintillations of her playful mind,</L>
<L>An aptitude that never lost its aim)</L>
<L>With brilliant Sevigné inwreathe her name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To discontent, the vice of age, unknown,</L>
<L>Her chearfulness maintain'd its envied throne:</L>
<L>The gay, the old, the learned, and the young,</L>
<L>And they whose heart pure elegance had strung,</L>
<L>By the soft pow'r of her enchantment won,</L>
<L>Would oft the glare of throng'd assemblies shun,</L>
<L>To court her ready wit's enliv'ning beam,</L>
<L>And bask beneath its undulating gleam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet oft from these unnotic'd would she steal,</L>
<L>To soothe the bed-rid stretch'd on Torture's wheel,</L>
<L>To smoothe the furrow on Misfortune's brow,</L>
<L>To warm the timid and exalt the low,</L>
<L>With lenient hand administer relief,</L>
<L>And close the bleeding artery of grief,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<L>Ah, ever dear! ah, venerable shade!</L>
<L>Indulge this honor by Affection paid.</L>
<L>Enthron'd in bliss, ah! yet forbear to shun</L>
<L>This holy tribute from a zealous son.</L>
<L>'Twas mine, attendant on thy evening ray,</L>
<L>To watch the sun-set of thy blameless day;</L>
<L>To see thee, weary of th' unequal strise,</L>
<L>Shed the faint glimm'rings of exhausted life,</L>
<L>And (heavenly moralist, sublimely great!)</L>
<L>At the dread opening of thy future state,</L>
<L>Teach by example, to thy latest breath,</L>
<L>Meekness in pain, and fortitude in death.</L>
