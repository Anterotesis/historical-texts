<HEAD>THE CARPENTER; Or, the DANGER of EVIL COMPANY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a young West-country man,</L>
<L>A Carpenter by trade;</L>
<L>A skilful wheelwright too was he,</L>
<L>And few such Waggons made.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No Man a tighter Barn cou'd build,</L>
<L>Throughout his native town,</L>
<L>Thro' many a village round was he,</L>
<L>The best of workmen known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His father left him what he had,</L>
<L>In sooth it was enough;</L>
<L>His shining pewter, pots of brass,</L>
<L>And all his household stuff.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A little cottage too he had,</L>
<L>For ease and comfort plann'd,</L>
<L>And that he might not lack for ought,</L>
<L>An acre of good land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A pleasant orchard too there was,</L>
<L>Before his cottage door;</L>
<L>Of cider and of corn likewise,</L>
<L>He had a little store.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Active and healthy, stout and young,</L>
<L>No business wanted he;</L>
<L>Now tell me reader if you can,</L>
<L>What man more blest cou'd be?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To make his comfort quite compleat,</L>
<L>He had a faithful Wife;</L>
<L>Frugal and neat and good was she,</L>
<L>The blessing of his life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where is the Lord, or where the Squire.</L>
<L>Had greater cause to praise,</L>
<L>The goodness of that bounteous hand,</L>
<L>Which blest his prosp'rous days?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each night when he return'd from work,</L>
<L>His wife so meek and mild,</L>
<L>His little supper gladly dress'd,</L>
<L>While he caress'd his child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One blooming babe was all he had,</L>
<L>His only darling dear,</L>
<L>The object of their equal love,</L>
<L>The solace of their care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O what cou'd ruin such a life,</L>
<L>And spoil so fair a lot?</L>
<L>O what cou'd change so kind a heart,</L>
<L>All goodness quite forgot?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With grief the cause I must relate,</L>
<L>The dismal cause reveal,</L>
<L>'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK,</L>
<L>The source of every ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Cooper came to live hard by,</L>
<L>Who did his fancy please;</L>
<L>An idle rambling Man was he,</L>
<L>Who oft had cross'd the seas.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This Man could tell a merry tale,</L>
<L>And sing a merry song;</L>
<L>And those who heard him sing or talk,</L>
<L>Ne'er thought the ev'ning long.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>But vain and vicious was the song,</L>
<L>And wicked was the tale;</L>
<L>And every pause he always fill'd,</L>
<L>With cider, gin, or ale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Carpenter delighted much,</L>
<L>To hear the Cooper talk;</L>
<L>And with him to the Ale-house oft,</L>
<L>Wou'd take his evening walk.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At first he did not care for drink,</L>
<L>But only lik'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un;</L>
<L>But soon he from the Cooper learnt,</L>
<L>The same sad course to run.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said the Cooper's company,</L>
<L>Was all for which he car'd;</L>
<L>But soon he drank as much as he,</L>
<L>To swear like him soon dar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His hammer now neglected lay,</L>
<L>For work he little car'd;</L>
<L>Half finish'd wheels, and broken tools,</L>
<L>Were strew'd about his yard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To get him to attend his work,</L>
<L>No prayers cou'd now prevail:</L>
<L>His hatchet and his plane forgot,</L>
<L>He never drove a Nail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His chearful ev'nings now no more,</L>
<L>With peace and plenty smil'd;</L>
<L>No more he sought his pleasing Wife,</L>
<L>Nor hugg'd his smiling child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For not his drunken nights alone,</L>
<L>Were with the Cooper past;</L>
<L>His days were at the Angel spent,</L>
<L>And still he stay'd the last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No handsome Sunday suit was left,</L>
<L>Nor decent holland shirt;</L>
<L>No nosegay mark'd the Sabbath day,</L>
<L>But all was rags and dirt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more his Church he did frequent,</L>
<L>A symptom ever sad;</L>
<L>Where once the Sunday is mispent,</L>
<L>The week days must be bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The cottage mortgag'd for its worth,</L>
<L>The favourite orchard sold;</L>
<L>He soon began to feel th'effects</L>
<L>Of hunger and of cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pewter dishes one by one,</L>
<L>Were pawn'd, till none was left;</L>
<L>And wife and babe at home remain'd</L>
<L>Of every help bereft.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By chance he call'd at home one nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>And in a surly mood,</L>
<L>He bade his weeping wife to get</L>
<L>Immediately some food.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His empty cupboard well he knew</L>
<L>Must needs be bare of bread;</L>
<L>No rasher on the rack he saw,</L>
<L>Whence cou'd he then be fed?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rquin's Gardener.</NOTE> a piteous sigh did heave,</L>
<L>And then before him laid</L>
<L>A basket cover'd with a cloth</L>
<L>But not a word she said.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to her husband gave a knife</L>
<L>With many a silent tear;</L>
<L>In haste he tore the cover off,</L>
<L>And saw his child lay there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"There lies thy babe, the mother said,</L>
<L>"Oppress'd with famine sore;</L>
<L>"O kill us both—'twere kinder far,</L>
<L>We cou'd not suffer more."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Carpenter, struck to the heart,</L>
<L>Fell on his knees straitway;</L>
<L>He wrung his hands—confess'd his sins,</L>
<L>And did both weep and pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From that same hour the Cooper more,</L>
<L>He never wou'd behold;</L>
<L>Nor wou'd he to the Ale-house go,</L>
<L>Had it been pav'd with gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Wife forgave him all the past,</L>
<L>And sooth'd his sorrowing mind,</L>
<L>And much he griev'd that e'er he wrong'd</L>
<L>The worthiest of her kind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By lab'ring hard, and working late,</L>
<L>By industry and pains,</L>
<L>His Cottage was at length redeem'd,</L>
<L>And sav'd were all his gains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Sundays now at Church were spent,</L>
<L>His home was his delight.</L>
<L>The following verse himself he made,</L>
<L>And read it every night:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Drunkard Murders Child and Wife,</L>
<L>Nor matters it a pin,</L>
<L>Whether he stabs them with his knife,</L>
<L>Or starves them by his gin.</L>
