<HEAD>AN ELEGY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHERE sighs the Zephyr to yon lonely Tree,</L>
<L>A solemn Grove its leafy Mantle spread:</L>
<L>Where bend yon mould'ring Turrets o'er the Sea,</L>
<L>A venerable Dome once rear'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The solemn Grove, the venerable Dome,</L>
<L>Were erst frequented by a num'rous Train,</L>
<L>Ev'n chaste as they who Dian's Mountain roam,</L>
<L>But not subjected to her gentle Reign:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>Far other Goddess did this Train obey,</L>
<L>Far other Temples, other Altars rais'd,</L>
<L>Far other Meaning breath'd their Choral Lay,</L>
<L>Far other Incense on their Altars blaz'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Veil'd Superstition wak'd her magic Sound,</L>
<L>Bad Albion's Sons forsake the splendid Court,</L>
<L>Forsake Amusement's variegated Round,</L>
<L>And to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able Standard here resort:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! obsequious to her stern Command,</L>
<L>A sullen-pensive Brotherhood they came,</L>
<L>Refus'd to trace the Paths by Nature plan'd,</L>
<L>And raz'd from Glory's Page their ancient Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Nor these alone were found incloister'd here,</L>
<L>Here also dwelt the simple-minded Swain,</L>
<L>Who wrapt in Sloth dream'd out the lazy Year,</L>
<L>'While Industry sat weeping on the Plain.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The many Temples rising fair to view,</L>
<L>Which tow'ring Superstition call'd her own,</L>
<L>With Hand unerring radiant Truth o'erthrew,</L>
<L>And snatch'd th' Impostor from her tinsel'd Throne:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On yon Dust-level'd Spire the crafty Maid,</L>
<L>With Indignation brooding in her Breast</L>
<L>Sits gloomily—Her Vot'ries all are fled,</L>
<L>Her Lamps extinguish'd, and her Rites suppress'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>Within her Hand a vacant String she holds</L>
<L>That one connected many a hallow'd Bead:</L>
<L>The blotted Scroll the other Hand unfolds,</L>
<L>Contains the Maxims of her slighted Creed:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Couch'd at her Feet, behold a mould'ring Shrine</L>
<L>(Of various Relics once the dread Abode)</L>
<L>Where runs the Spider o'er his treach'rous Line,</L>
<L>Where lurks the Beetle, and the loathsome Toad:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On Darkness' wing now sails the midnight Hour,</L>
<L>When for the grateful Sound of choral Pray'r,</L>
<L>The shrieking Owl from yon disparted Tow'r,</L>
<L>With Notes of Horror wakes her trembling Ear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<L>Of human Grandeur mark the fleeting Day,</L>
<L>How frail each Purpose, and each Wish how vain!</L>
<L>The strong-built Domes, the cloister'd Fanes decay,</L>
<L>And Ruin hovers round the desert Scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Path that leads to yonder shatter'd Pile</L>
<L>Is now perplex'd with many a sordid Brier:</L>
<L>No Crowd is seen within the sacred Isle,</L>
<L>The Sabbath mourns its long-deserted Quire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The golden Crozier blended with the Dust</L>
<L>In horrid Folds the Serpent clasps around:</L>
<L>The pow'rful Image, and the sainted Bust,</L>
<L>Defam'd, unhallow'd, press the weedy Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<L>Not distant far, her gold-encircled Tow'r</L>
<L><HI>Th' inviolable Dome</HI> majestic rear'd,</L>
<L>On whose dread Altar breath'd some hidden Pow'r,</L>
<L>By Terror guarded, and by Kings rever'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To which Asylum ev'n th' Assassin came,</L>
<L>(His Hand audacious still imbrued with Gore)</L>
<L>The Boon of full Impunity to claim,</L>
<L>While feeble Justice wept her baffled Lore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So Truth at length dissolv'd the mental Chain,</L>
<L>And banish'd Error from th' enlighten'd Shore:</L>
<L>So clos'd at length the busy-acted Scene,</L>
<L>The Curtain drop'd, and Folly's Mask was o'er.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>Then gladsome <HI>Ceres</HI> rais'd her drooping Head,</L>
<L>(While yellow Harvests gilt the smiling Plain)</L>
<L>Beheld a youthful Band around her spread,</L>
<L>With Sickles arm'd to reap the bearded Grain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Warrior then beneath the trailing Vest,</L>
<L>The peaceful Cassock, or the drowsy Cowl,</L>
<L>No longer quench'd the Flame within his Breast,</L>
<L>Or lull'd the Purpose of his daring Soul:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But rush'd undaunted to the doubtful War,</L>
<L>Pursued where Glory led the radiant Way,</L>
<L>Till Neptune rising on his coral Car,</L>
<L>Resign'd his wat'ry World to <HI>Britain's</HI> Sway.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>The Virgin Fair by venal Guardians doom'd,</L>
<L>By Error prompted, or subdued by Force,</L>
<L>No more in Cloisters drear their Days consum'd:</L>
<L>Like Flow'rets strew'd around the senseless Corse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Triumphant <HI>Hymen</HI> hail'd the blissful Hour,</L>
<L>And saw a white-rob'd social Train approach,</L>
<L>For whom the Pleasures dress'd the happy Bow'r,</L>
<L>And scatter'd Roses o'er the destin'd Couch.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Still other Blessings from this Change appear'd,</L>
<L>No injur'd Family did then behold</L>
<L>On loit'ring Monks its native Wealth confer'd,</L>
<L>Nor spacious Altars cover'd with its Gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>Full many trod that crooked Path to Fame,</L>
<L>Yet from her Hand receiv'd no lasting Meed,</L>
<L>She from her Annals rends their fading Name,</L>
<L>And gives to Infamy the worthless Deed:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Vengeance some pursued with dire Disgrace,</L>
<L>Pursued beyond the Circle of its Sphere,</L>
<L>Ev'n to the Cemetery's dark Recess,</L>
<L>Nor spar'd them sleeping on the peaceful Bier:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beside the spreading of that sombrous Yew,</L>
<L>Where yawns with hideous Chasm the vaulted Cave,</L>
<L>Presenting to the fix'd astonish'd View,</L>
<L>The Profanation of a rifled Grave:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>The large-endowing <HI>Rufus</HI> lay inurn'd</L>
<L>With many a sculptur'd Image on his Shrine,</L>
<L>That smit with Sorrow o'er his Ashes mourn'd,</L>
<L>The Sister-Graces and the tuneful Nine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imprinted on Tradition's storied Leaf</L>
<L>Is found (to this sepulchral Spot confin'd)</L>
<L>A Terror-breathing Tale that wins Belief,</L>
<L>And oft repeated by the neighb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From where yon Mountain shades the dreary Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>Attracted by the Scent of human Blood,</L>
<L>A Troop of Wolves voracious scour'd amain,</L>
<L>And at this Charnel Vault requir'd their Food:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<L>When, horrid to relate! they burst the Tomb,</L>
<L>And swift descending to the deepest Shade,</L>
<L>Up-tore the shrouded Tenant from its Womb,</L>
<L>And o'er the mangled Corse relentless prey'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The paly Stars with dim reluctant Light,</L>
<L>Like Tapers glimmer'd on their Orgies foul,</L>
<L>While gliding Spectres scream'd with wild Affright,</L>
<L>Re-echo'd loud by their tremendous Howl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! what avail'd the solemn-moving Herse?</L>
<L>The sabled-mantled Cars, the Fun'ral Throng?</L>
<L>Grav'd on his Monument the soothing Verse?</L>
<L>The Priests, the Torches, and the choral Song?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<L>Misjudging Wretch! while thou with Hand profuse,</L>
<L>Thy Treasures on this Mansion didst entail,</L>
<L>And pour down Riches on the vow'd Recluse,</L>
<L>Thine Orphan Babes partook a scanty Meal:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy widow'd Fair, her Cheek bedew'd with Tears,</L>
<L>Approach'd with suppliant Knee the Cloister-Gate,</L>
<L>There oft disclos'd in vain, her poignant Cares,</L>
<L>Returning still to weep her haploso Fate.</L>
