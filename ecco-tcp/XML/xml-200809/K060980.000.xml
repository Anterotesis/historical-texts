<HEAD>AN Explanatory Preface.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not that I see any Reason to alter my Opinion in any thing I have Writ, which occasions this Epi∣stle; but I find it necessary for the satisfaction of some Persons of Honour, as well as Wit, to pass a short Explication upon it, and tell the World what I mean, or rather, what I do not mean, in some things wherein I find I am liable to be mis-understood.</P>
<P>I confess my self something surpriz'd to hear that I am tax'd with Bewraying my Own Nest, and Abusing our Nation, by Discovering the Meanness of our Original, in order to make the <HI>English</HI> contemptible abroad and at home; in which, I think, they are mistaken: For why should not our Neighbours be as good as We to Derive from? And I must add, That had we been an Unmix'd Nation, I am of Opinion it had been to our Disadvantage: For to go on far∣ther, we have three Nations about us as clear from Mix∣tures of Blood as any in the World, and I know not which of them I could wish our selves to be like; I mean the <HI>Scots,</HI> the <HI>Welsh</HI> and <HI>Irish;</HI> and if I were to write a Re∣verse to the <HI>Satyr,</HI> I would examine all the Nations of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and prove, That those Nations which are most mix∣ed, are the best, and have least of Barbarism and Brutality among them; and abundance of Reasons might be given for it, too long to bring into a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>But I give this Hint, to let the World know, that I am far from thinking, 'tis a <HI>Satyr,</HI> upon the <HI>English</HI> Nation, to tell them, They are Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heaven; that is, <HI>from several Nations</HI> Nor is it meant to undervalue the Original of the <HI>English,</HI> for we see no Reason to like them the worse, being the Relicks of <HI>Romans, Danes, Saxons</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> than we shoul'd ha' done, if they had remain'd <HI>Britains,</HI> that is, <HI>than if they had been all</HI> Welshmen.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
But the Intent of the <HI>Satyr</HI> is pointed at the Vanity of those who talk of their Antiquity, and value themselves up∣on their Pedigree, their Ancient Families, and being <HI>True Born;</HI> whereas 'tis impossible we shou'd be <HI>True Born;</HI> and if we could, shou'd have lost by the Bargain.</P>
<P>These sort of People, who Call themselves <HI>True Born,</HI> and tell long Stories of their Families, and like a Nobleman of <HI>Venice, Think a Foreigner ought not to walk on the same side of the Street with them,</HI> are own'd to be meant in this <HI>Satyr.</HI> What they would infer from their own Original, I know not, nor is it easie to make out whe∣ther they are the better, or the worse for their Ancestors: Our <HI>English</HI> Nation may Value themselves for their <HI>Wit, Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Courage,</HI> and I believe few will dispute it with them; but for long Originals, and Ancient <HI>True Born</HI> Fa∣milies of <HI>English,</HI> I wou'd advise them to wave the Dis∣course. A <HI>True English</HI> Man is one that deserves a Cha∣racter, and I have no where lessened him, that I know of; but as for a <HI>True Born</HI> English Man, I confess I do not understand him.</P>
<P>From hence I only infer, That an <HI>English</HI> Man, of all Men ought not to despise Foreigners <HI>as such,</HI> and I think the Inference is just, since <HI>what they are to day, we were yesterday, and to morrow they will be like us.</HI> If Foreigners misbehave in their several Stations and Employ∣ments, <HI>I have nothing to do with that;</HI> the Laws are open to Punish them equally with Natives, and let them have no Favour.</P>
<P>But when I see the Town full of Lampoons and Inve∣ctives against <HI>Dutchmen, only because they are Foreign∣ers,</HI> and the King Reproached and Insulted by Insolent Pe∣dants, and Ballad-making Poets, for employing Foreigners; and for being a Foreigner himself, I confess my self mov'd by it to remind our Nation of their own Original, thereby to let them see what a Banter is put upon our selves in it; since speaking of <HI>Englishmen ab Origine,</HI> we are really Foreigners our selves.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
I could go on to prove 'tis also Impolitick in us to dis∣courage Foreigners; since 'tis easie to make it appear that the multitudes of Foreign Nations who have took Sanctuary here, have been the greatest Additions to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation; the great Essential whereof is the Number of its Inhabitants: Nor would this Nation have ever arriv'd to the Degree of Wealth and Glory, it now boasts of, if the addition of Foreign Nations, both as to Ma∣nufactures and Arms, had not been helpful to it. This is so plain, that he who is ignorant of it, is too dull to be talk∣ed with.</P>
<P>The <HI>Satyr</HI> therefore I must allow to be just, till I am o∣therwise convinc'd; because nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear our People boast of that Antiquity, which if it had been true, would have left us in so much worse a Con∣dition than we are in now: Whereas we ought rather to boast among our Neighbours, that we are a part of them∣selves, or the same Original as they, but better'd by our Cli∣mate, and like our Language and Manufactures, deriv'd from them, and improv'd by us to a Perfection greater than they can pretend to.</P>
<P>This we might have valued our selves upon without Va∣nity: But to disown our Descent from them, talking big of our Ancient Families, and long Originals, and stand at a distance, from Foreigners, like the <HI>Enthusiast</HI> in Religion, with a <HI>Stand off, I am more holy than thou:</HI> This is a thing so ridiculous, in a Nation deriv'd from Foreigners, as we are, that I could not but attack them as I have done.</P>
<P>And whereas I am threaten'd to be call'd to a Publick Account for this Freedom; and the Publisher of this has been <HI>New-Paper'd</HI> in Goal already for it; tho' I see no∣thing in it for which the Government can be displeased; yet, if at the same time those People who with an Unlimited Ar∣rogance in Print, every day <HI>Affront the King, Prescribe the Parliament, and Lampoon the Government,</HI> may be either Punished or Restrained, I am content to stand and fall by the Publick Justice of my Native Countrey, which I am not sensible I have any where injur'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
Nor would I be mis-understood concerning the Clergy; with whom if I have taken any License more than becomes a <HI>Satyr,</HI> I question not but those Gentlemen, who are Men of Letters, are also Men of so much Candor, as to allow me a Loose at the Crimes of the Guilty, without thinking the whole Profession Lash'd, who are Innocent. I profess to have very mean Thoughts of those Gentlemen who have deserted their own Principles, and expos'd even their Morals as well as Loyalty; but not at all to think it affects any but such as are concern'd in the Fact.</P>
<P>Nor wou'd I be mis-represented as to the Ingratitude of the <HI>English</HI> to the King and his Friends; as if I meant the <HI>English as a Nation,</HI> are so. The contrary is so apparent, That I wou'd hope it shou'd not be Suggested of me: And therefore when I have brought in <HI>Britannia</HI> Speaking of the King, I suppose Her to be the Representative, or Mouth of the Nation, as a Body. But if I say we are full of such who daily affront the King, and abuse his Friends; who Print Scurrilous Pamphlets, Virulent Lampoons, and reproachful Publick Banters, against both the King's Person and Go∣vernment; I say nothing but what is too true: And that the <HI>Satyr</HI> is directed at such, I freely own; and cannot say, but I shou'd think it very hard to be Censur'd for this <HI>Satyr,</HI> while such remain Ʋnquestion'd, and tacitly approv'd. That I can mean none but such, is plain ftom these few Lines.
<Q><L>Ye Heavens regard! Almighty <HI>Jove,</HI> look down,</L>
<L>And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne.</L>
<L>On their Ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take,</L>
<L>Who sought his Aid, and then his Part forsake.</L></Q></P>
<P>If I have fallen upon our Vices, I hope none but the Vi∣cious will be Angery. As for Writing for Interest, I dis∣own it; I have neither <HI>Place,</HI> nor <HI>Pension,</HI> nor <HI>Prospect;</HI> nor <HI>seek none,</HI> nor will <HI>have none:</HI> If matter of Fact justi∣fies the Truth of the Crimes, the <HI>Satyr</HI> is Just. As to the Poetick Liberties, I hope the Crime is Pardonable: I am
<PB REF="6"/>
content to be Ston'd, provided none will Attack me but the Innocent.</P>
<P>If my Country-Men wou'd take the Hint, and grow bet∣ter-Natur'd from my <HI>ill-Natur'd Poem,</HI> as some call it; I would say this of it, that tho' 'tis far from the best <HI>Satyr</HI> that ever was Wrote, 'twould do the most Good that ever <HI>Satyr</HI> did.</P>
<P>And yet I am ready to ask Pardon of some Gentlemen too; who tho' they are <HI>English-men,</HI> have good Nature enough to see themselves Reprov'd, and can bear it. These are Gentlemen in a true Sence, that can bear to be told of their <HI>Faux Pas,</HI> and not abuse the Reprover. To such I must say, this is no <HI>Satyr;</HI> they are Exceptions to the Ge∣neral Rule; and I value my Performance from their Ge∣nerous Approbation, more than I can from any Opinion I have of its Worth.</P>
<P>The hasty Errors of my Verse I made my Excuse for, before; and since the time I have been upon it has been but little, and my Leisure less, I have all along strove rather to make the Thoughts Explicite, than the Poem Correct. However, I have mended some Faults in this Edition, <HI>and the rest must be plac'd to my Account.</HI></P>
<P>As to Answers, Banters, <HI>True English Billinsgate,</HI> I expect them till no Body will buy, and then the Shop will be shut. Had I wrote it for the Gain of the Press, I should have been concern'd at its being Printed again and again, by <HI>Pyrates,</HI> as they call them, and <HI>Paragraph-Men:</HI> But would They but do it Justice, and Print it True, according to the Copy, they are welcome to Sell it for a Penny, if they Please.</P>
<P>The Pence indeed is the End of their Works. I'll engage, if no body will Buy, no body will Write: And not a Patriot-Poet of them all, now will in Defence of his Native Coun∣try, <HI>which I have abus'd, they say,</HI> Print an <HI>Answer</HI> to it, and give it about for <HI>Gods-sake.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE End of Satyr is Reformation: And the Au∣thor, tho' he doubts the Work of Conversion is at a General Stop, has put his Hand to the Plow.</P>
<P>I expect a Storm of Ill-Language from the Fury of the Town, and especially from those whose <HI>English</HI> Talent it is to Rail: And without being taken for a Conjurer, I may venture to foretell, That I shall be Cavil'd at about my <HI>Mean Stile, Rough Verse,</HI> and <HI>In∣correct Language;</HI> things I might indeed have taken more Care in; But the Book is Printed; and tho' I see some Faults, 'tis too late to mend them: And this is all I think needful to say to them.</P>
<P>Possibly some body may take me for a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> in which they are mistaken: But I am one that would be glad to see <HI>Englishmen</HI> behave themselves better to Strangers, and to Governours also; that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries for belonging to a <HI>Nation that wants Manners.</HI></P>
<P>I assure you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Strangers use us better Abroad; and we can give no reason but our Ill-Na∣ture for the contrary here.</P>
<P>Methinks an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who is so Proud of being call'd <HI>A Goodfellow,</HI> shou'd be Civil: And it cannot be deny'd but we are in many Cases, and particularly to Strangers, the Churlishest People alive.</P>
<P>As to Vices, who can dispute our <HI>Intemperance,</HI> while an <HI>Honest</HI> Drunken Fellow is a Character in a
<PB REF="8"/>
Mans Praise? All our Reformations are Banters, and will be so, till our Magistrates and Gentry Reform themselves by way of Example; then, and not till then, they may be expected to Punish others without Blushing.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> I desire to be understood of that particular People, who pretending to be Prote∣stants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Li∣berties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <HI>James</HI> and his Popish Powers: Together, with such who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the present Government, and yet abuse and affront the King, who procur'd it, and openly profess their Un∣easiness under him: These, by whatsoever Names or Titles they are dignified, or distinguish'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I disown, but that it is so much the Temper of an <HI>Englishman</HI> to abuse his Bene∣factor, that I could be glad to see it rectified.</P>
<P>They who think I have been Guilty of any Error, in exposing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themselves, may among many honest Instances of the like Nature, find the same thing in Mr. <HI>Cowely,</HI> in his Imitation of the second Olympick Ode of <HI>Pindar:</HI> His Words are these,<Q><L>But in this Thankless World, the Givers</L>
<L>Are Envy'd even by th' Receivers:</L>
<L>'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fashion,</L>
<L>Rather to hide than pay an Obligation.</L>
<L>Nay, 'tis much worse than so;</L>
<L>It now an <HI>Artifice</HI> doth grow,</L>
<L><HI>Wrongs</HI> and <HI>Outrages</HI> to do,</L>
<L>Lest Men should think we <HI>Owe.</HI></L></Q></P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SPeak, <HI>Satyr;</HI> for there's none can tell like thee,</L>
<L>Whether 'tis Folly, Pride, or Knavery,</L>
<L>That makes this Discontented Land appear</L>
<L>Less Happy now in Times of Peace, than War?</L>
<L>Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more</L>
<L>Than all our Bloody Wars have done before?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fools out of Favour Grudge at Knaves in Place,</L>
<L><HI>And Men are always Honest in Disgrace:</HI></L>
<L>The Court Preferments make Men Knaves in course:</L>
<L>But they which wou'd be in them, wou'd be worse.</L>
<L>'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine,</L>
<L>Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign:</L>
<L>The Grand Contention's plainly to be seen,</L>
<L>To get some Men put out, and some put in.</L>
<L>For this our S—rs make long Harangues,</L>
<L>And florid M—rs whet their polish'd Tongues.</L>
<L><HI>Statesmen are always sick of one Disease;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And a good Pension gives them present Ease.</HI></L>
<L>That's the Specifick makes them all Content</L>
<L>With any King, and any Government.</L>
<L>Good Patriots at Court-Abuses rail;</L>
<L>And all the Nation's Grievances bewail:</L>
<L>But when the <HI>Sov'reign Balsam</HI>'s once apply'd,</L>
<L>The Zealot never fails to change his Side.</L>
<L>And when he must the <HI>Golden Key</HI> resign,</L>
<L>The <HI>Railing Spirit</HI> comes about again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse,</HI></L>
<L>While they their own Felicities refuse?</L>
<L>Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother,</L>
<L>And now are falling out with one another:</L>
<L>With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill,</L>
<L><HI>And always have been sav'd against their Will:</HI></L>
<L>Who Fifty Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> have disburs'd,</L>
<L>To be with Peace and too much Plenty Curs'd.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo,</L>
<L>And yet uneasily Obey the New.</L>
<L>Search, <HI>Satyr,</HI> search; a deep Incision make;</L>
<L>The Poyson's strong, the Antidote's too weak.</L>
<L>'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute,</L>
<L>And down-right English, <HI>Englishmen</HI> Confute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride;</L>
<L>And with keen Phrase repel the Vicious Tide.</L>
<L>To <HI>Englishmen</HI> their own beginnings show,</L>
<L><HI>And ask them why they slight their Neighbours so.</HI></L>
<L>Go back to elder Times, and Ages past,</L>
<L>And Nations into long Oblivion cast;</L>
<L>To old <HI>Britannia</HI>'s Youthful Days retire,</L>
<L>And there for <HI>True-Born Englishmen</HI> enquire.</L>
<L><HI>Britannia</HI> freely will disown the Name,</L>
<L>And hardly knows, her self, from whence they came:</L>
<L>Wonders that They of all Men shou'd pretend</L>
<L>To <HI>Birth</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and for a Name contend.</L>
<L>Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell,</L>
<L>And fetch the dark Original from Hell:</L>
<L>Speak, <HI>Satyr,</HI> for there's none like thee can tell.</L>

So jealous of the Power their Kings possess'd,</L>

<L><HI>A Ruling Priest-hood, as a Priest-rid King.</HI></L>
<L>And of all Plagues with which Mankind are Curst,</L>
<L><HI>Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the Worst.</HI></L>

<LG>
<L>When Kings, the Sword of Justice first lay down,</L>
<L>They are no Kings, tho' they posses the Crown:</L>

<L>But if the <HI>Mutual Contract</HI> was dissolv'd,</L>
<L>The Doubt's explain'd, the difficultys 'solv'd:</L>
<L><HI>That Kings when they Descend to Tyranny,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Dissolve the Bond, and leave the Subject free.</HI></L>

<L>And Constitutions are non-Entities.</L>

A Chaos free to chuse for their own share,</L>
<L>What Case of Government they please to wear:</L>

<L>To <HI>Postulata's</HI> of the Government;</L>
<L>Which if he breaks, he cuts off the Entail,</L>
<L>And Power retreats to its Original.</L>

<P>YOUR Majesty has so often declar'd Your just Con∣cern for the Nations Loss, and Your Value for the Memory of the late King: You have so publickly approv'd his Conduct, so visibly mov'd in the same Steps, and pursu'd the wise Measures of this <HI>Your Glorious An∣cestor,</HI> that it cannot be thought displeasing to Your Ma∣jesty, to reprehend those who make a Mock at the Sorrow of Your Majesty and Three Nations.</P>
<P>Your Majesty was the first who told us <HI>he cou'd not be sufficiently Lamented.</HI> May those who are not of the same Mind find no Favour with Your Majesty, nor ther Maker, till they repent that Sin against his Merit, and the Voice of their Native Country.</P>
<P>Here are no Reflections upon Your Majesties <HI>Houshold,</HI> or <HI>Council,</HI> or <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> or <HI>either House of Parliament,</HI> and consequently no Offence against Your Royal

Proclamation. 'Twou'd be an Affront to Your Majesty to imagine there were any, under all those Heads of Your Go∣vernment, cou'd deserve the Reproof of the following <HI>Satyr.</HI></P>
<P>Your Majesty has an entire Possession of the Hearts of Your People, but their Affection is still the deeper rooted by that generous Sorrow you have express'd for the Loss of Him, to whom they owe the full Possession of their Liberty under Your Government.</P>
<P>How they can be faithful Subjects to Your Majesty that were not true Friends to such a King, is a Mystery out of bumane Understanding, since the Happiness we enjoy by Your Government proceeds from his defending us against those <HI>who wou'd not have had Your Majesty to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>'Twou'd be a Crime against Your Majesty, which deserv'd no Pardon, to suggest You shou'd be offended at that part of the <HI>Satyr</HI> which points at our Immoralities: Your Majesties Example, as well as Command, has encourag'd us all to <HI>declare War</HI> against Vice, and there we are sure of Your Royal Protection.</P>
<P>For the rest, if an extraordinary Concern for the Glori∣ous Memory of the late King has led the Author into any Excesses, he begs Your Majesty would place it to the Ac∣count of that <HI>just Passion</HI> every honest Man retains for his extraordinary Merit; believing that no Man can have an Indifferency for the Memory of King William, and at the same time have any Desire for the Welfare of his Na∣tive Country.</P>
<P>While Your Majesty pursues the true Interest of <HI>England,</HI> the Protestant Religion, and the Welfare of <HI>Europe,</HI> as He did, You will have the same Enemies that he had; the same to oppose You Abroad, and reproach You at Home; but You will thereby engage all Your Honest Subjects to ad∣here the firmer to their Duty, all Your Protestant Neigh∣bours to depend upon Your Protection, and God shall Crown Your Majesty and these Nations with His Special Favour and Benediction.</P>

<HEAD>REFORMATION OF MANNERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults, but he that has none of his own, <HI>say some People, who are loth to be told of their Errours;</HI> and 'tis on this Account only, that the World has the Trouble of a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>If that be true, the Author freely acknowledges he is the most unqualified Man in the World to reprove.</P>
<P>That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes, who allows himself in the Practice of the same, is very rea∣dily granted, and is the very Substance and Foundation of the following <HI>Satyr:</HI> And on that score, the Author has as good a Title to Animadversion as another, since no Man can charge him with the Vices he has reproved.</P>
<P>But instead of Self-defence, he is rather willing to look back on the best Actions of his Life, with the Temper of a Penitent, and he wishes all Men wou'd do the like; 'tis the only way to make the <HI>Satyr</HI> Impertinent.<Q><L>For Penitence would all his Verse disarm,</L>
<L>The <HI>Satyr</HI>'s answer'd if the Men reform.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the Fact is not true neither: 'Tis a very pretty way for Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition. If
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
none but faultless Men must reprove others, the Lord ha' Mercy upon all our Magistrates; and all our Clergy are undignified and suspended at a Blow.</P>
<P>Nor does the <HI>Satyr</HI> assault private Infirmity, or pursue Personal Vices; but is bent at those, who pretending to suppress Vice, or being vested with Authority for that pur∣pose, yet make themselves the Shame of their Country, en∣couraging Wickedness by that very Authority they have to suppress it.</P>
<P>He professes himself sorry, either that Freedom of Speech is so dangerous in this Age, or that he is too much a Cow∣ard; otherwise, some had heard of their Crimes who think themselves above the Power of Punishment.</P>
<P>'Tis hard that Vice should have so much shelter from Civil Power, that Reproof shou'd lead the Party to suppress the Poet rather than the Crime.</P>
<P>And yet his Friends give him over for lost: An Ac∣count of what he has ventur'd to say, to whose Importunity he thinks himself oblig'd to answer with <HI>Juvenal,</HI><Q><L>Difficile est Satyram non scribere. Nam quis Iniquae</L><L>Tam Patiens Urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se?</L></Q></P>
<P>If any Man is injur'd by the Characters, he is content they should carry their Resentment to what Extremity they please; but if Truth may be on his side, the only way to make him do them Justice is to reform: And he promises to give Testimony to their Repentance, <HI>as an Amand Honourable,</HI> in a manner as publick as possible.</P>

<L>HOW long may Heav'n be banter'd by a Nation,</L>
<L>With broken Vows, &amp; Shams of Reformation,</L>
<L>And yet forbear to show its Indignation?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell me ye Sages, who the Conscience guide,</L>
<L>And Ecclesiastick Oracles divide,</L>
<L>Where do the Bounds of Sovereign Patience end,</L>
<L>How long may People undestroy'd offend?</L>
<L>What Limits has Almighty Power prepar'd,</L>
<L>When Mercy shall be deaf and Justice heard?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If there's a Being Immortal and Immense,</L>
<L>Who does Rewards and Punishments dispence,</L>
<L>Why is he Passive when his Power's defy'd,</L>
<L>And his Eternal Government's deny'd?</L>

<L>Unreins no Vengeance, lets no Thunders fly,</L>
<L>When Villains prosper, and successful Vice,</L>
<L>Shall humane Power controul and Heavenly Power despise?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If 'tis because the Sins of such a Nation,</L>
<L>Are yet too small to conquer his Compassion,</L>
<L>Then tell us to what height Mankind may sin,</L>
<L>Before Celestial Fury must begin?</L>
<L>How their extended Crimes may reach so high,</L>
<L>Vengeance must follow and of course destroy;</L>
<L>And by the common Chain of Providence,</L>
<L>Destruction come like Cause and Consequence.</L>

<L>No Plague, no sulphurous Shower her <HI>exit</HI> makes,</L>

No more the sacred Place commands our Awe,</L>

<L>The Reverend Pile can scarce its Ruins show,</L>

</LG>

<L>Yet <HI>Ostia</HI> stands, her impious Towers defie</L>
<L>The threatning Comets of the blazing Sky,</L>
<L>Foreboding Signs of Ruine she despises,</L>

<L>Fraternities of Villains he maintains,</L>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>REformation of Manners is a Work so Honourable, and at this Time so absolutely necessary, that like the Reform of our Money it can be no longer delay'd.</P>
<P>The Ways by which the present Torrent of Vice has been let in upon the Nation, and by which it maintains the Ty∣ranny it has usurp'd on the Lives of the Inhabitants, are too plain to be hid. The following Sheets aim at the Work, by leading to the most direct means, <HI>Viz.</HI> Reformation by Ex∣ample. Laws are, <HI>in Terrorem</HI> Punishments, and Ma∣gistrates Compel and put a Force upon Mens Minds; but Example is Perswasive and Gentle, and draws by a Secret, Invisible, and almost Involuntary Power.</P>
<P>If there can be any Remedies proposed more proper to bring it to pass, they that know them would do well to bring them forth. In the mean time the Author thinks Conscience in the Minds of Men Impartially Consulted, will give a <HI>Pro∣batum est</HI> to the following Proposal; and to that Judgment be refers all those who Object against it.</P>

<HEAD>THE The Poor Man's PLEA.</HEAD>
<P>IN searching for a proper Cure of an Epidemick Distemper, Physicians do tell us 'tis first necessa∣ry to know the Cause of that Distemper, from what Part of the Body, and from what ill Habit it proceeds; and when the Cause is discover'd, it is to be removed, that the Effect may cease of its self; but if removing the Cause will not work the Cure, then in∣deed they proceed to apply proper Remedies to the Disease it self, and the particular Part afflicted.</P>
<P>Immorality is without doubt the present reigning Distemper of the Nation: And the King and Parli∣ament, who are indeed the proper Physicians, seem nobly inclin'd to undertake the Cure. 'Tis a Great Work, well worthy their utmost Pains: The Honour of it, were it once perfected, would add more Tro∣phies to the <HI>Crown,</HI> than all the Victories of <HI>this Bloody War,</HI> or the Glories of <HI>this Honourable Peace.</HI></P>
<P>But as a Person under the Violence of a Disease sends in vain for a Physician, unless he resolves to make use of his Prescription; so in vain does the King attempt to reform a Nation, unless they are willing to reform themselves, and to submit to his Prescriptions.</P>
<P>Wickedness is an Ancient Inhabitant in this Coun∣try, and 'tis very hard to give its Original.</P>
<P>But however difficult that may be, 'tis easy to look back to a time when we were not so generally infect∣ed with Vice as we are now; and 'twill seem suffici∣ent to enquire into the Causes of our present Defecti∣on.</P>
<P>The Protestant Religion seems to have an unquesti∣oned <HI>Title</HI> to the first introducing a strict Morality
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
mong us; and 'tis but just to give the Honour of it, where 'tis so eminently due. Reformation of Man∣ners has something of a Natural Consequence in it from Reformation in Religion For since the prin∣ciples of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion disown the Indulgen∣cies of the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, by which a thousand Sins are, <HI>as Venial Crimes,</HI> bought off, and the Priest, to <HI>save God Almighty the trouble,</HI> can blot them out of the Account before it comes to his hand; common Vices lost their Charter, and men could not sin at so cheap a Rate as before. The Protestant Religion has in it self a Natural Tendency to Virtue, as a standing Te∣stimony of its own Divine Original, and accordingly it has suppress'd Vice and Immorality in all the Coun∣tries where it has had a Footing: It has civiliz'd Nati∣ons, and reform'd the very <HI>Tempers</HI> of its Professors: Christianity and Humanity has gone hand in hand in the World; and there is so visible a difference between the other Civiliz'd Governments in the World, and those who now are under the Protestant Powers, that it carries its Evidence in it self.</P>
<P>The Reformation, begun in <HI>England</HI> in the days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and afterwards gloriously fi∣nished by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> brought the <HI>English</HI> Nati∣on to such a degree of Humanity, and Sobriety of Conversation, as we have reason to doubt will hard∣ly be seen again in our Age.</P>
<P>In King <HI>James</HI> the First's time, the Court affect∣ing something more of Gallantry and Gaiety, Luxury got footing; and twenty Years Peace, together with no extraordinary Examples from the Court, gave too great Encouragement to Licentiousness.</P>
<P>If it took footing in King <HI>James</HI> the First's time, it took a deep Root in the Reign of his Son; and the Liberty given the Soldiery in the Civil War, dis∣pers'd all manner of Prophanness throughout the Kingdom. That Prince, tho' very Pious in his own
<PB N="117" REF="114"/>
Person and Practice and had the Misfortune to be the first King of <HI>England,</HI> and perhaps in the World, that ever establish'd Wickedness by a Law: By what un∣happy Council, or secret ill Fate he was guided to it, is hard to determine; but the <HI>Book of Sports,</HI> as it was called, that Book to tolerate the Exercise of all Sports and Pastimes on the Lord's-Day, tended more to the vitiating the Practice of this Kingdom, <HI>as to keeping that Day,</HI> than all the Acts of Parliament, Proclama∣tions and Endeavours of future Princes has done, or ever will do, to reform it.</P>
<P>And yet the People of <HI>England</HI> express'd a general sort of an Aversion to that Liberty; <HI>and some,</HI> as if glutted with too much Freedom, when the Reins of Law were taken off, refused that Practice they allow'd themselves in before.</P>
<P>In the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, Lewdness and all manner of Debauchcry arriv'd to its Meridian: The Encouragement it had from the Practice and Al∣lowance of the Court, is an invincible Demonstration how far the Influence of our Government extends in the Practice of the People.</P>
<P>The present King and his late Queen, whose Glo∣rious Memory will be dear to the Nation as long as the World stands, have had all this wicked Knot to unravel. This was the first thing the Queen set up∣on while the King was engaged in his Wars abroad: She first gave all sorts of Vice a general Discourage∣ment; and on the contrary, rais'd the value of Vir∣tue and Sobriety by her Royal Example. The King having brought the War to a Glorious Conclusion, and settled an Honourable Peace, in his very first Speech to his <HI>Parliament</HI> proclaims a New War against <HI>Prophaneness</HI> and <HI>Immorality,</HI> and goes on also to dis∣courage the practice of it by his Royal Example.</P>
<P>Thus the Work is begun nobly and regularly; and the <HI>Parliament,</HI> the General Representative of the Na∣tion,
<PB N="118" REF="115"/>
follows this Royal Example, in enacting Laws to suppress all manner of Prophaneness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These are Great Things, and, well-improv'd, would give an undoubted Overthrow to to the Tyranny of Vice, and the Dominion <HI>Prophaneness</HI> has usurp'd in the hearts of Men.</P>
<P>But we of the <HI>Plebeii</HI> find our selves justly aggrie∣ved in all this Work of Reformation; and this Re∣forming Rigor makes the real Work impossible: Wherefore we find our selves forced to seek Redress of our Grievances in the old honest way of Petition∣ing Heaven to relieve us: And in the mean time, we solemnly Enter our <HI>Protestation</HI> against the Vicious part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation; as follows:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We Protest, That we do not find, impartial∣ly enquiring into the matter, speaking of Moral Good∣ness, that you are not one jot better than we are, <HI>your Dignities, Estates, and Quality excepted.</HI> 'Tis true, we are all bad enough, and we are willing in good Manners to agree, that we are as wicked as you; but we cannot find, on the exactest Scrutiny, but that in the Commonwealth of Vice, the Devil has taken care to level Poor and Rich into one Class, and is fair∣ly going on to make us all Graduates in the last De∣gree of Immorality.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We do not find that all the Proclama∣tions, Declarations, and Acts of Parliament yet made, have any <HI>effective Power</HI> to punish <HI>you</HI> for your Immo∣ralities, as it does <HI>us.</HI> Now while <HI>you</HI> make Laws to punish <HI>us,</HI> and let <HI>your selves</HI> go free, tho' guilty of the same Vices and Immoralities, those Laws are unjust and unequal in themselves.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Laws do not express a Liberty to <HI>you,</HI> and a Punishment to <HI>us;</HI> and therefore the King and Parliament are free, as King and Parliament, from this our Appeal; but the Gentry and Magistrates of the
<PB N="119" REF="116"/>
Kingdom, while they execute those Laws upon us the poor Commons, and themselves practising the same Crimes, in defiance of the Laws both of God and Man, go unpunish'd; <HI>This</HI> is the Grievance we protest a∣gainst, as unjust and unequal.</P>
<P>Wherefore, till the Nobility, Gentry, Justices of the Peace, and Clergy, will be pleased either to Re∣form their own Manners, and suppress their own Im∣moralities, or find out some method and Power im∣partially to punish themselves when guilty, we Hum∣bly crave Leave to Object against setting any Poor Man in the Stocks, or sending them to the House of Correction for Immoralities, as the most unequal and unjust way of proceeding in the World.</P>
<P><HI>And now Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>That this Protestation may not seem a little too Rude, and a Breach of Good Manners to our Superi∣ours, ws crave Leave to subjoin our Humble Appeal to your selves; and will for once, knowing you as <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen to be Men of Honour, <HI>make you Judges in your own Case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Gentlemen, We appeal to your selves, whe∣ther ever it be likely to perfect the Reformation of Manners in this Kingdom, without you; Whether Laws to punish us, without your Example also to influ∣ence us, will ever bring the Work to pass.</P>
<P>The first Step from a loose vicious Practice in this Nation was begun by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, backt by a Reform'd Clergy, and a Sober Nobility: Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> carried it on: 'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which first again Degenerated from that strict Observation of Moral Virtues, and from thence carried Vice on to that degree it now appears in. From the Court Vice took its <HI>Progress</HI> into the Coun∣try; and in the Families of the Gentry and Nobility it harbour'd, till it took heart under their <HI>Protection,</HI> and made a general Salley into the Nation; and We

the poor Commons, who have been always easy to be guided by the Example of our Landlords and Gentle∣men, have really been debauch'd into Vice by their Examples: And it must be the <HI>Example of you the No∣bility and Gentry of the Kingdom,</HI> that must put a Stop to the Flood of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Prophaneness</HI> which is broken in upon the Country, or it will never be done.</P>
<P>Our Laws against all manner of Vicious <HI>Practices</HI> are already very severe: But Laws are useless insig∣nificant things, if the Executive <HI>Power</HI> which lies in the Magistrate be not exerted. The Justices of the <HI>Peace</HI> have the power to punish, but if they do not put forth that power, 'tis all one as if they had none at all: Some have possibly exerted this power; but where∣ever it has been so put forth, it has fallen upon us the poor Commons: These are all Cobweb Laws, in which the small Flies are catch'd, and great ones break thro'. My Lord Mayor has whipt about the poor Beggars, and a few scandalous Whores have been sent to the House of Correction; some Alehouse-keepers and Vint∣ners have been fin'd for drawing Drink on the Sab∣bath day; but all this falls upon us of the Mob, the poor <HI>Plebeii,</HI> as if all the Vice lay among us; for we do not find the Rich Drunkard carri'd before my Lord Mayor, nor a Swearing Lewd <HI>Merchant. The man with a Gold Ring and Gay Cloaths,</HI> may Swear before the Justice, or at the Justice; may reel home through the open Streets, and no man take any notice of it; but if a poor man get drunk, or swears an Oath, he must to the Stocks without Remedy.</P>
<P>In the second place, We appeal to your selves, whe∣ther Laws or <HI>Proclamations</HI> are capable of having any Effect towards a Reformation of <HI>Manners,</HI> while the Benches of our Justices are infected with the scanda∣lous Vices of Swearing and Drunkenness; while our Justices themselves shall punish a man for Drunken∣ness, with a <HI>God damn him, set him in the Stocks:</HI> And
<PB N="121" REF="118"/>
if Laws and Proclamations are useless in the Case, then they are good for nothing, and had as good be let alone as publish'd.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, to be punish'd for a Crime, by a man as guilty as our selves; and that the Fi∣gure a man makes in the World, must be the reason why he shall not be liable to the Law: This is really punishing men for being poor, which is no Crime at all; as a Thief may be said to said to be hang'd, not for the Fact, but for being taken.</P>
<P>We further appeal to your selves, Gentlemen, to inform us, whether there be any particular reason why you should be allow'd the full Career of your cor∣rupt Appetites, without the Restraint of Laws, while you your selves agree that such Offences shall be pun∣ished in us, and do really execute the Law upon the Poor People, when brought before you for the same things.</P>
<P>Wherefore that the Work of Reformation of Man∣ners may go on, and be brought to Perfection, to the Glory of God, and the great Honour of the King and Parliament: That Debauchery and Prophaness, Drun∣kenness, Whoring, and all sorts of Immoralities may be suppress'd, we humbly propose the Method which may effectually accomplish so great a Work.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the Gentry and Clergy, who are the Leaders of us poor ignorant people, and our Lights erected on high places to Guide and Govern us, would in the first place put a voluntary Force upon them∣selves, and effectually reform their own Lives, their way of conversing, and their common Behaviour a∣mong their Servants and Neighbours.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gentry. They are the Original of the Modes, and Customs, and Manners of their Neigh∣bours; and their examples in <HI>the Countries especially</HI> are very moving. There are three several Vices, which have the principal Mannagement of the great∣est
<PB N="122" REF="119"/>
part of Mankind, <HI>viz.</HI> Drunkenness, Swearing, and Whoring; all of them very ill becoming a Gen∣tleman, however Custom may have made them Mo∣dish: Where none of these Three are in a House, there is certainly something of a Plantation of God in the Family; for they are such Epidemic Distempers, that hardly Humane Nature is entirely free from them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Drunkenness that Brutish Vice; a Sin so sor∣did, and so much a Force upon Nature, that had God Almighty enjoyn'd it as a Duty, I believe many a Man would have ventur'd the loss of Heaven, rather than have have perform'd it. The <HI>Pleasure</HI> of it seems to be so secretly hid, that wild Heathen Nations know nothing of the matter; 'tis only discover'd, by the wise people of these <HI>Northern</HI> Countries, who are <HI>Proficients</HI> in Vice, <HI>Philosophers</HI> in Wickedness, who can extract a Pleasure to themselves in losing their Understanding, and make themselves Sick at Heart for their Diversion.</P>
<P>If the History of this well bred Vice was to be writ∣ten, 'twould plainly appear that it begun among the Gentry, and from them was handed down to the poo∣rer sort, who still love to be like their Betters. Af∣ter the Restitution of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when drinking the King's Health became the distinction between a <HI>Cavalier</HI> and a <HI>Roundhead,</HI> Drunkenness <HI>be∣gan its Reign,</HI> and it has Reign'd almost Forty Years: The Gentry caress'd this Beastly Vice at such a Rate, that no Companion, no Servant was thought proper unless he could bear a Quantity of Wine: and to this Day 'tis added to the Character of a Man, as an addi∣tional Title, when you would speak well of him, <HI>He is an Honest Drunken Fellow;</HI> as if his Drunkenness was a Recommendation of his Honesty. From the practice of this nasty Faculty, our Gentlemen have
<PB N="123" REF="120"/>
arriv'd to the teaching of it; and that it might be effectually preserv'd to the next Age, have very early instructed the Youth in it. Nay, so far has Custom prevail'd, that the Top of a Gentleman's Entertain∣ment has been to make his Friend Drunk; and the Friend is so much reconcil'd to it, that he takes that for the effect of his Kindness, which he ought as much to be affronted at, as if he had kick'd him down Stairs: Thus 'tis become a Science: and but that the Instruction proves so easie, and the Youth too apt to learn, possibly we might have had a Colledge erected for it before now. The further Perfection of this Vice among the Gentry, will appear in two things; that 'tis become the Subject of their Glory, and the way of expressing their Joy for any publick Blessing. <HI>Jack,</HI> said a Gentleman of very high Quality, when after the Debate in the House of Lords, K. <HI>William</HI> was Voted into the Vacant Throne; <HI>Jack</HI> (says he) <HI>God damn ye,</HI> Jack, <HI>go home to your Lady, and tell her we have got a Protestant King and Queen; and go make a Bonfire as big as a House, and bid the Butler make ye all Drunk, ye Dog:</HI> Here was sacrificing to the Devil, for a Thanksgiving to God. Other Vices are committed as Vices, and Men act them in private, and are willing to hide them; but Drunkenness they are so fond of, that they will glory in it, boast of it, and endeavour to promote it as much as possible in others: 'Tis a Triumph to a Champion of the Bottle, to repeat how many Quarts of Wine he has Drank at a sitting, and how he made such and such Honest Fellows Drunk. Men <HI>Lye</HI> and <HI>Forswear,</HI> and <HI>hide it,</HI> and are <HI>asham'd of it,</HI> as indeed they have reason to do: But Drunkenness and Who∣ring are Accomplishments Men begin to value them∣selves upon, repeat them with Pleasure, and affect a sort of Vanity in the History; are content all the world should be Witnesses of their Intemperance, and have
<PB N="124" REF="121"/>
made the Crime a Badge of Honour to their Breeding and introduce the practice as a Fashion. And who∣ever gives himself the Trouble to Reflect on the Cu∣stom of our Gentlemen in their Families, encourage∣ing and promoting this Vice of Drunkenness, among the poor Commons, will not think it a Scandal upon the Geutry of <HI>England,</HI> if we say, That the Mode of Drinking, as 'tis now practised, had its Original from the Practice of the Country-Gentlemen, and they again from the Court.</P>
<P>It may be objected, and God forbid it should not, That there are a great many of our Nobility and Gen∣tlemen, who are Men of Honour and Men of Morals, and therefore this Charge is not universal. To which we answer, Tis universal for all that; because those very Gentlemen, tho' they are negatively clear as to the Commission of the Crimes we speak of, yet are positively guilty, in not executing that Power the Law has put into their hands, with an Impartial Vigour. For where was that Gentleman or Justice of the Peace ever yet found, who executed the Terms of the Law upon a Drunken, Swearing, Lewd Gentleman, his Neighbour, but the Quality of the Person has been a License to the open Exercise of the worst Crimes; as if there were any Baronets, Knights, or Squires in the next World; who because of those little steps Cust∣om had raised them on, higher than their Neighbours, should be exempted from the Divine Judicature; or that, as Captain <HI>Vratz</HI> said, who was Hang'd for Mur∣th'ring Esquire <HI>Thynn, God would show them some re∣spect as they were Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>If there were any reason why a Rich Man should be permitted in the publick Exercise of Open Immo∣ralities, and not the poor Man, something might be said: But if there be any difference it lies the other way; for the Vices of a poor Man affect only himself; but the Rich Man's Wickedness affects all the Neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="125" REF="122"/>
gives offence to the Sober, and encourages and hardens the Lewd, and quite overthrows the weak Resolutions of such as are but indifferently fix∣ed in their Virtue and Morality. If my own Watch goes false, it deceives me and none else; but if the Town Clock goes false, it deceives the whole Parish. The Gentry are the Leaders of the Mob; if they are Lewd and Drunken, the others strive to imitate 'em; if they Discourage Vice and Intemperance, the other will not be so forward in it, nor so fond of it.</P>
<P>To think then to effect a Reformation by punish∣ing the Poor, while the Rich seem to Enjoy a Charter for Wickedness, is like <HI>taking away the Effect, that the Cause may cease.</HI></P>
<P>We find some People very fond of Monopolizing a Vice, they would have all of it to themselves; they must, as my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> said of himself, <HI>Sin like a Lord;</HI> little sneaking Sins won't serve turn; but they must be Lewd at a rate above the Common Size, to let the World see they are capable of it.</P>
<P>Our Laws seem to take no Cognizance of such, per∣haps for the same reason that <HI>Lycurgus</HI> made no Law against <HI>Parricide,</HI> because he would not have the Sin named among his Citizens.</P>
<P>Now the poor Man sees no such Dignity in Vice, as to study Degrees; we are down-right in Wickedness, as we are in our Dealings; if we are Drunk, 'tis plain Drunkenness; Swearing, and Whoring, is all Blunderbus with us; we don't affect such Niceties in our Conversation; and the Justices use us accordingly; nothing but the Stocks, or the House of Correction is the Case, when we are brought before them; but when our Masters the Gentlemen come to their Refi∣ned Practice, and Sin by the Rules of Quality, we do not find any thing come of it but false Heraldry, the Vice is punish'd by the Vice, and the Punishment re∣news the Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="123"/>
The Case in short is this; the Lewdness, Prophane∣ness, and Immorality of the Gentry, which is the main Cause of the General Debauchery of the Kingdom is not at all toucht by our Laws, as they are now Executed; and while it remains so, the Reformation of Manners can never be brought to pass, nor Prophaneness and Immorality Suppress'd; and therefore the punishing the Poor distinctly, is a Mock upon the good Designs of the King and Parliament; an Act of Injustice up∣on them to punish them, and let others as guilty go free; and a sort of Cruelty too, in taking the advan∣tage of their Poverty to make them suffer, because they want Estates to purchase their Exemption.</P>
<P>We have some weak Excuses for this Matters, which must be considered: As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Justice of the Peace is a <HI>Passive Magist∣rate,</HI> till an Information be brought before him, and is not to take notice of any thing, but as it is laid in Fact, and brought to an Affidavit. Now if an Affida∣vit be made before a Justice, that such or such a man Swore, or was Drunk, he must, or cannot avoid Fin∣ding him; the Law obliges him to it, let his Quality be what it will; so that the Defect is not in the Law, nor in the Justice, but in the want of Information.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Name of an Evidence or Informer is so scandalous, that to attempt to inform against a Man for the most open Breach of the Laws of Morality, is enough to denominate a man unfit for Society; a Rogue and an Informer are Synonimous in the Vulgar Acceptation; so much is the real Detection of the o∣penest Crimes against God, and Civil Government, Discouraged and Avoided.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Impossibility of the Cure is such, and the Habit has so obtain'd upon all Mankind, that it seems twisted with Human Nature, as an Appendix to Natural Frailty, which it is impossible to separate from it:</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="124"/>
<HI>For Answer:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis true, the Justice of the Peace is in some respect a <HI>Passive Magistrate,</HI> and does not act but by Information, but such Information would be brought if it were encouraged; if Justices of of the Peace did acquaint themselves with their Neigh∣bourhood, they would soon hear of the Immoralities of the Parish; and if they did impartially Execute the Law on such as offended, without respect of Persons they would soon have an Account of the Persons and Circumstances. Besides, 'tis not want of Informati∣on, but want of punishing what they have Informati∣on of. A Poor Man informs against a Great Man, the Witness is discouraged, the Man goes unpunish'd, and the Poor Man gets the Scandal of an Informer; and then 'tis but too often that our Justices are not Men of extraordinary Morals themselves; and who shall Inform a Justice of the Peace that such a Man Swore, when he may be heard to Swear himself as fast as another? Or who shall bring a Man before a Ju∣stice for being Drunk, when the Justice is so Drunk himself, he cannot order him to be set in the Stocks?</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Besides, the Justice has a Power to punish any Fact he himself sees committed, and to enquire into any he hears of casually: and if he will stand still and see those Acts of Immorality committed before his Face, who shall bring a Poor Man before him to be punished? Thus I have heard a Thousand horrid Oaths Sworn on a Bowling-Green, in the presence of a Justice of the Peace, and he take no Notice of it, and go home the next hour, and set a Man in the Stocks for being Drunk.</P>
<P>As to the Scandal of Informing, <HI>'tis an Error in Custom,</HI> and a great Sin against Justice; 'tis necessary indeed that all Judgment should be according to Evidence, and to di∣scourage Evidence is to discourage Justice; but that a Man in Trial of the Morality of his Neighbour, should be
<PB N="128" REF="125"/>
shamed to appear, must have some particular cause.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) It proceeds from the Modishness of the Vice; it has so obtain'd upon some Men Mens Practices, that to appear against what almost all Men approve, seems malicious, and has a certain prospect either of Revenge or of a Mercenary Wretch, that Informs meerly to get a Reward. 'Tis true, if no Reward be plac'd upon an Information, no Man will take the trouble; and again, if too great a Reward, Men of Honour shun the thing, because they scorn the Fee, and to inform meerly for the Fee has something of a Rascal in it too; and from these reasons arises the Backwardness of the People.</P>
<P>The very same Rich Men we speak of are the per∣sons who discourage the Discovery of Vice by scandalizing the Informer; a Man that is any thing of a Gentleman scorns it, and the Poor still Mi∣mick the Humour of the Rich, and hate an Informer as they do the Devil, 'Tis strange the Gentlemen should be asham'd to detect the Breach of those Laws, which they were not asham'd to make; but the very Name of an Informer has gain'd so black an Idea in the minds People, because some have made a Trade of inform∣ing against People for Religion, have misbehaved themselves, that truly 'twill be hard to bring any Man either of Credit or Quality to attempt it.</P>
<P>But the main thing which makes our Gentlemen backward in the prosecution of Vice, is their practi∣cing the same Crimes themselves, and they have so much wicked Modesty and Generosity in them, being really no Enemies to the thing it self, that they cannot with any sort of Freedom punish in others what they practice themselves.</P>
<P>In the Times of Executing the Laws against Dis∣senters, we found a great many Gentlemen very Vi∣gorous in Prosecuting their Neighbours; they did not stick to appear in Person to disturb <HI>Meetings,</HI> and
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
demolish the <HI>Meeting-Houses,</HI> and rather than fail, would be Informers themselves; the reason was be∣cause they had also a dislike to the thing; but we never found a Dissenting Gentleman, or Justice of the Peace forward to do thus, because they approved of it. Now were our Gentlemen and Magistrates real Enemies to the Immoralities of this Age, did they really hate Drunkenness as a Vice, they would be for∣ward and zealous to root the practice of it out of the Neighbourhood, they would not be backward or a∣sham'd to detect Vice, to disturb Drunken Assemblies, to disperse those Plantations of Leachery, the Publick Bawdy Houses, which are almost as openly allowed as the <HI>Burdelloes</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> They would be willing to have all sorts of Vices Suppress'd, and glory in put∣ting their hands to the Work; they would not be a∣sham'd to appear in the detecting Debauchery, or a∣fraid to embroil themselves with their Rich Neigh∣bours. 'Tis Guilt of the same Fact which makes Con∣nivance, and till that guilt be removed, the Gentle∣men of <HI>England</HI> neither will or can indeed with any kind of Honour put their hands to the Reforming it in their Neighbours.</P>
<P>But I think 'tis easie to make it appear that this dif∣ficulty of Informing may be removed, and there need not be much occasion for that Scandalous Employment.</P>
<P>'Tis in the power of the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> to re∣form the whole Kingdom without either Laws, Pro∣clamations, or Informers; and without their Concur∣rence, all the Laws, Proclamations, and Declarations in the World will have no Effect; the Vigour of the Laws consists in their Executive Power: Ten thousand Acts of Parliament signifie no more than One single Proclama∣tion, unless the Gentlemen in whose hands the Execu∣tion of those Laws is placed, take care to see them du∣ly made use of; and how can Laws be duly Executed-but by an impartial Distribution of equal Rewards,
<PB N="130" REF="127"/>
and Punishments, without Regard to the Quality and Degree of the Persons? The Laws push on the Ju∣stices now, and they take care to go no faster than they are driven; but would the Justices push on the Laws, Vice would fly before them, as Dust in the Wind, and Immoralities would be soon suppress'd; but it can never be expected that the Magistrates should push on the Laws to a free Suppression of Im∣moralities, till they Reform themselves, and their Great Neighbours Reform themselves, that there may be none to Punish, who are too big for the Magistrate to venture upon,</P>
<P>Would the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> decry the Modish∣ness of Vice by their own Practice; would they but dash it ouf of Countenance by disowning it; that Drunkenness and Oaths might once come into <HI>dife∣steem,</HI> and be out of Fashion, and a Man be valued the less for them; that he that will Swear, and be Drunk, shall be counted a Rake, and not fit for a Gentleman's Company. This would do more to Reforming the rest of Mankind than all the Punishments the Law can inflict; the Evil encreased by Example, and must be Suppress'd the the same way. If the Gentry were thus Reform'd, their Families would be so too: No Servant would be Entertain'd, no Workman Employ∣ed, no Shopkeeper would be Traded with by a Gen∣tleman, but such as like themselves, were sober and honest; a Lewd Vicious Drunken Footman must Re∣form or Starve, he would get no Service; a Servant once turn'd away for his Intemperance would be En∣tertain'd by no Body else; a Swearing Debauch'd Labourer or Workman must Reform, or no Body would Employ him; the Drunken Whoring Shop∣keeper must grow Sober, or lose all his Customers, and be undone. Interest and Good Manners will re∣form us of the poorer sort, there would be no need of the Stocks or Houses of Correction; we should be
<PB N="131" REF="128"/>
Sober of Course, because we should be all Beggars else; and he that loved the Vice so dearly as to pur∣chase it with the loss of his Trade and Employment, would soon grow too Poor for his Vice, and be forc'd to leave it by his own Necessities; there would be no need of Informers, a Vicious Fellow would be pre∣sently Notorious, he would be the Talk of the Town, every one wou'd slight and shun him for fear of be∣ing thought like him, by being seen in his Company: he would Expose himself, and would be Punish'd as unpitied as a Thief.</P>
<P>So that in short, the whole Weight of this Blessed Work of Reformation, lies on the Shoulders of the Gentry; they are the cause of our Defection, which being taken away, the Effect would cease of Course, Vice would grow Scandalous, and all Mankind would be asham'd of it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Clergy also ought not to count them∣selves exempted in this matter, whose Lives have been, and in some places still are so vicious and so loose, that 'tis well for <HI>England</HI> we are not subject to be much <HI>Priest-riddden.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a strange thing how it should be otherwise than it is with us the poor Commonalty, when the Gentry our Pattern, and the Clergy our Teachers are as Immoral as we. And then to consider the Cohe∣rence of the thing; <HI>the Parson preaches a thundering Ser∣mon against Drunkenness, and the Justice of Peace sets my poor Neighbour in the Stocks, and I am like to be much the better for either, when I know perhaps that this same Parson and this same Justice were both Drunk together the Night before.</HI></P>
<P>It may be true, for ought we know, that a Wick∣ed Parson may make a good Sermon; and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Proverb may be true of the Soul as well as the Body, <HI>If the Cure be but wrought, let the Devil be the Doctor;</HI> but this does not take with the down-right ignorant
<PB N="130" REF="129"/>
People in the Country; a poor Man gets Drunk in a Country Ale House, <HI>Why, are you not asham'd to be such a Beast, says a good honest Neighbour to him the next day?</HI> Asham'd, says the Fellow! Why should I be asham'd? Why, there was Sir <HI>John —</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert —</HI> and the Parson, and they were all as Drunk as I. And why a Beast, Pray? I heard Sir <HI>Robert —</HI> say, That
<Q><L>He that Drinks least,</L>
<L>Drinks most like a Beast.</L></Q></P>
<P>A Vicious Parson that preaches well, but lives ill, may be like an unskilful Horseman, who opens a Gate on the wrong side, and lets other Folks through, but shuts himself out. This may be possible, but it seems most reasonable to think they are a means by that sort of living, to hinder both themselves and others; and would the Gentry and Clergy of <HI>England</HI> but look back on the Guilt that really lies on them, as Gentle∣men by whose Example so great a part of Mankind has been led into, and encouraged in the Progress of Vice, they would find Matter of very serious reflecti∣on.</P>
<P>This Article of the Clergy may seem to lie in the Power of their Superiors to rectify, and therefore may be something more feasible than the other; But the Gentry are <HI>Sui juris,</HI> can no way be reduced but by their own voluntary practice. We are in <HI>England</HI> exceedingly govern'd by Modes and Customs. The Gentry may effectually Suppress Vice, would they but put it out of Fashion; but to Suppress it by Force seems impossible.</P>
<P>The Application of this rough Doctrine is in short both to the Gentry and Clergy, <HI>Physicians Heal your selves;</HI> if you leave off your Drunkenness and Lewd∣ness first, if we do not follow you, then set us in the Stocks, and send us to the House of Correction, and
<PB N="133" REF="130"/>
punish us as you please; if you will leave off Whor∣ing first, then Brand us in the Foreheads, or Trans∣port or Hang us for Fornication or Adultery, and you are welcome; but to preach against Drunkenness immediately after an Evening's Debauch; to Correct a poor Fellow for Swearing with the very Vice in your Mouths; these are the unjustest ways in the World, and have in themselves no manner of tendency to∣wards the Reformation of Manners, which is the true Design of the Law.</P>
<P>'Tis acknowledg'd there are in <HI>England</HI> a great many Sober, Pious, Religious Persons both among the Gentry and Clergy, and 'tis hoped such cannot think themselves Libell'd or Injur'd in this <HI>Plea;</HI> if there were not, Laws would never have been made against those Vices, for no men make Laws to punish them∣selves; 'tis design'd to reflect upon none but such as are Guilty, and on them no farther than to put them in mind how much the Nation owes its present Dege∣neracy to their folly, and how much it is in their <HI>Po∣wer</HI> to Reform it again by their Example; that the King may not publish <HI>Proclamations,</HI> nor the <HI>Parliament</HI> make Laws to no purpose; but that we might live in <HI>England</HI> once more like Christians, and like Gen∣tlemen, to the Glory of God, and the Honour of the present King and Parliament, who so publickly have attemped the Great Work of Reformation among us, tho' hitherto to so little purpose.</P>

<HEAD>Preface to Mr. <HI>HOW.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THese Sheets are address'd to you, because the Au∣thor, with Submission, thinks they something more nearly concern you, than ordinary:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As you are, not unjustly, esteemed one of the most Learned and Judicious of the Dissenting Ministry. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As you have more immediate Relation to our present Lord-Mayor, who is or has been a Member of the Church of Christ under your Charge.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Author has carefully avoided Personal Reflections, and hopes he has no where exceeded the Rules of Charity or Good Manners.</P>
<P>The Treatise is individually the same which the Author publish'd in the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>Humphry Edwin;</HI> the Address by way of Preface, being only left out.</P>
<P>The Debate was then young, and the Practice of this Scandalous Conformity was new: Sir <HI>John Shorter</HI> being the first Instance of it. But it is now growing a received

Custom, to the great Scandal of the Dissenters in general, the Offence of such whose Consciences forbid them the same Latitude, and the Stumbling of those who being before weak and irresolute, are Led aside by the Eminency and Fre∣quency of Examples.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> If you knew the Author, you would easily be satis∣fied that the Reason of this Preface, is not that he covets to engage in Controversy with a Person of your Capacity and Learning, being altogether unfit for such a Task, and no way a Match to your Talent that way.</P>
<P>But he desires, in the Name of himself, and a great ma∣ny honest good Christians, who would be glad to see this Case decided, That you will by your self, or some other Hand, as you please, declare to the World, Whether this Practice of Alternate Communion be allowed, either by your Congrega∣tion in particular, on the Dissenters in general.</P>
<P>And if not so allow'd, then he conjures you by the Hon∣our you owe to your Profession, and the Tenderness you have for the Weakness of others; by the regard you have to God's Honour, and the Church you serve, That such Proceedings may receive their due Censure, tho the Persons wear the Gay Cloaths and the Gold Ring; that the Sincerity and Purity of Dissenting Protestants may be vindicated to the World both in their Discipline as well as Doctrine; and that without Respect of Persons.</P>
<P>If on the other hand it be allow'd, 'tis desired it may be defended by such Arguments as you think convenient; which the Author promises, if desir'd, never to reply to; or if you give him that Liberty, shall do it so, as you shall easily see is in order only to be inform'd, and always suita∣ble to the Respect which is due to your Person; for whom none has a greater Esteem.</P>
<P>If none of these Requests shall be granted, the World must believe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>That Dissenters do Allow themselves to Practice what they cannot Defend.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE UPON Occasional Conformity.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I review the Past Times, and look back upon the various Scenes which they present us, as to Ecclesiastical Transacti∣ons within this Kingdom, there seems nothing more strange than the Turns we have had from Popish to Re∣gal Supremacy, from the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion to Reform'd, from Reform'd back again to <HI>Romish,</HI> and then to Refor∣med again, and so on thro' several Degrees of Refor∣mation, and back again from those Degrees to the first Steps of Reformation, and then forward again.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, a Prince of a haughty Spirit, disdaining the Insolence with which his Predecessors were treated by the Popes, gave the first Shock to the <HI>Roman</HI> Power in these Kingdoms. I won't say he acted from any principles of Conscience, whatever his Ambition and Interest led him to pretend; but <HI>that</HI> was the Gloss, as it is in most Cases of Publick Revolutions. <HI>However it was,</HI> having satisfi'd his Pride by subduing the Suppremacy of the Pope, and establishing his own; his Interest next guided him to the Suppression of Abbies and Monastries. The hor∣rible Vices which were protected, as well as practiced in those Nests of Superstition, giving his pretence of Piety the larger Scope; and I'll for once be so free with the Character of that Prince, as to suppose what to me seems plain, that <HI>neither This Religion, or That, were of</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="134"/>
<HI>much Moment in his Thoughts, but his Interest,</HI> as the Sequel made plain, by the Seizure he made of the Re∣venues of the Church.</P>
<P>And yet the Justice of Providence seems very con∣spicuous in that point, That those Houses, who under the specious pretences of Religion and extraordinary Devotion, had amassed to themselves vast Revenues to the Impoverishing many Families, and in the mean time secretly practiced most unheard of Wickedness, should under the same pretence of Zeal and Piety be suppres∣sed and impoverished by a Person, who meerly to serve his own Glory, triumph'd over them, pretending, <HI>Jehu</HI> like, <HI>to shew his Zeal for the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Some do assure us, That the Eyes of this Pince were really open'd as to the Point of Religion; and that had he liv'd longer, he would most effectually have e∣stablish'd the Reformation in his time; but God who gave him that light, <HI>if he had it,</HI> however he might ac∣cept his Intention, as he did that of <HI>David</HI>'s Building his House, yet he reserv'd the Glory of the performance to his Son.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th, of whom wondrous things are spoken in all our <HI>English</HI> Writers, and more than we need suppose should be literally true; yet was without doubt, a Prince of the strictest Piety, not only that ever reign'd, but that ever liv'd, perhaps, since the Days of <HI>Josidh,</HI> whose Parallel our Writers say he was.</P>
<P>The Reformation began in his hand; not but that the Protestant Religion had been received in <HI>England</HI> many years before, by the preaching of <HI>John Wickliff, William Tindall,</HI> and others, and had many professors, and those such who gallantly offered their Lives in de∣fence of the Truth.</P>
<P>But it got but little ground, for Religion has but few Votaries, while all its professors must also be Con∣fessors, and while Exile or Martyrdom is all the pros∣pect of Advantage to be got by it.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="135"/>
None will dare to be Dissenters in times of Danger, but such whose Consciences are so awaken'd that they dare not be otherwise.</P>
<P>But in the hands of this young Prince, the great work was begun, and in a shorter time than could be ima∣gin'd, was finish'd and establish'd; the <HI>Romanists</HI> fled or conformed; for we find but very few had an Inclina∣tion to Martyrdom if it had been put upon them. Some indeed to show the Nature of their Religion, <HI>Pleaded for</HI> Baal, <HI>and Rebell'd,</HI> stirring up the Ignorant People to Murther their <HI>Gideon</HI> for throwing down the <HI>Altars of</HI> Baal, but like the <HI>Ephramites</HI> of old, their <HI>Shiboleth</HI> was their undoing.</P>
<P>God, who thought fit to discover the Levity of those who had only Conform'd, and not Reform'd, who, <HI>in exemplum Regis,</HI> had took up this as they would have done any Religion, and also for the Tryal and Glo∣ry of his Church, suffer'd all this great Fabrick, <HI>how∣ever of his own Working,</HI> to be overthrown at the Death this good King, and a Deluge of Cruelty and Popery overwhelm'd the People in the Reign of the Queen, his Sister.</P>
<P>But <HI>Popery</HI> found more Dissenters than the Reforma∣tion had done; and the Impression Religion had made on the minds of those who had sincerely Embrac'd it, was not so easily Defac'd as the pretended Reformati∣on of others; For the Glosses Men had put on their Actions, only as a cover from common Observation, was soon Discover'd, when the Safety of owning their Old principles render'd those Outsides no longer need∣ful, but where the True Religion had got footing in the Mind, it was still the same, whatever alterations of Times might meke it Dangerous, <HI>and yet all People did not Burn;</HI> but some being persecuted in one City, fled to another, and <HI>Germany</HI> especially was a Sanctuary for the Distressed <HI>English</HI> Protestants, that Country having been before hand with us in the Reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="136"/>
'Twas here that our Exil'd Clergy having convers'd with the Learned Reformers abroad, and particularly with <HI>John Calvin,</HI> found, that tho' they were reform'd indeed from the Gross Errors of Popery and Supersti∣tion, there was yet several things which might be fur∣ther and further Reform'd; and being willing to arrive to the greatest Perfection they were capable of in Religion, (that as near as possible they might pur∣sue the great Example of Christ Jesus, whose Name they profess'd, and for whom they cou'd most gloriously die,) they Corrected in themselves those things which they saw needful, and by Letters to their Brethren in <HI>En∣gland</HI> communicated their Opinions, with their Reasons, exhorting them to go on unto perfection as they had begun</P>
<P>Some of the most Zealous for Piety and Holiness of Life, rejected this Motion; and Others as Zealous and Pious, clos'd with it; and the Disputes were carried so far sometimes, as to Invade the Charity of one another, an humble Acknowledgment of which you have in a most Christian Reconciling Letter from Bishop <HI>Ridley</HI> to Bishop <HI>Hooper,</HI> two of the most Glorious Triumphant Martyrs that ever confest the truth of Christ at the Stake.</P>
<P>For the present, the Fire of the Persecution (as the Greater Light obscures the Less, extinguish'd that of Dissention. But when Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> rescu'd the Pro∣testant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the first Establishment of King <HI>Edward</HI> obtain'd so on the Minds of Men, that the further Reformation was rejected. The other Party being not at all convinc'd, tho' over-rul'd, submitted their Persons to the Laws, but not their Opi∣nion; affirming, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That 'twas the Duty of every Chri∣stian, to endeavour to serve God with the grea∣test Purity of Worship as was possible; and that this was the purest Worship which came nearest to the Divine Institution, which they believ'd the esta∣blish'd Liturgy did not, and therefore in Conscience they must be Dissenters.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="137"/>
It must be own'd, That the Original Authors of these Disputes were Learned, Devout, and singularly Pious, strict in Conversation to excess, <HI>if that be pos∣sible,</HI> and from thence in a sort of happy Derision, were call'd <HI>Puritans;</HI> of whom I shall say nothing, but leave for a Record the last Speech of a Famous Fo∣reigner, who had seen the way of living among those Dissenters, and speaking of the Words of <HI>Balaam, Let me Die the Death of the Righteous, and let my latter end be like his,</HI> cry'd Out,<Q>Sit Anima Mea cum Puritanis <HI>Anglicanis.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I shall not take upon me to observe the Difference between these Primitive Dissenters and Our Present, which is too plain; nor to dispute the Substance of the Point in Debate between them and the Establisht National Church.</P>
<P>I shall only observe, That the Reasons for the pre∣sent Dissenters Separation from the Establisht Church, are said to be exactly the same they were then; and the present Dissenters are the Successors of those first, as the present Conformists are the Successors of the first Reformers under King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, and Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>I must acknowledge that it fares with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and with the Dissenters both, as it has always far'd with Christ's Church in the whole World; That while Supprest and Persecuted, their Professors were few, and their Profession more severe; but when a Religion comes to be the Mode of the Country, so many painted Hypocrites get into the Church who are not by their Voices to be distinguish'd, that Guile is not to be seen, till it arrive to Apostacy. The whole Ecclesiastical History, from the first Cen∣tury of the Christian Church, is full of Instances to confirm this, That the Prosperity of the Church of
<PB N="141" REF="138"/>
Christ has been more fatal to it, than all the Pesecuti∣on of its Enemies.</P>
<P>I am now brought down to the present Time, when the <HI>Dissenting Protestant</HI> is sheltered by the Laws and protected from the Violence which he suffered in the Late Reigns, under the Arbitrary Commands of such State Ministers, who strove to dash the whole Prote∣stant Interest to pieces by its own weight; and no∣thing is more apparent to those who are any thing acquainted with the late Management of Affairs in this Land, than that the Court used both Parties alter∣nately, as Policy and Occasion directed, to Suppress and Destroy one another; that the whole House, <HI>which being so divided, cou'd not stand,</HI> might at last fall of it self.</P>
<P>But our Eyes are at last opened, the Name of Pro∣testant is now the common Title of an <HI>Englishman,</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> extends her Protection to the tender Consciences of her Weaker Brethren, know∣ing that all may be Christians, tho' not alike inform'd, and the Dissenter extends his Charity to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> believing that in his due time, <HI>God shall reveal even this unto them.</HI> If this is not, I wish this were the Temper of both Parties; and I am sure it is already the Temper of some of each Side, which few are of the Wisest, most Pious, and most Ju∣dicious.</P>
<P>But while Frailty and Infirmity are Essential to Humanity, and Pride and Hypocrisy are the two Regnant Vices of the Church, this good Spirit cannot be Universal, and we do not expect it.</P>
<P>But there is a sort of Truth, which all Men owe to the Principles they profess, and generally speaking, all Men pay it; a <HI>Turk</HI> is a <HI>Turk</HI> zealously and entire∣ly; an <HI>Idolater</HI> is an <HI>Idolater,</HI> and will <HI>serve the Devil to a tittle:</HI> None but Protestants halt between <HI>God and Baal;</HI> Christians of an Amphibious Nature, who
<PB N="142" REF="139"/>
have such preposterous Consciences, as can believe one Way of Worship to be right, and yet serve God another way themselves; <HI>This is a strange thing in Israel!</HI> All the Histories of Religion in the World do not shew such a Case: 'Tis like a Ship with her Sails hal'd some back and some full: 'Tis like a Workman that Builds with one Hand, and pulls down with t'other: 'Tis like a Fisherman, who catches Fish with one Hand, and throws them into the Sea with another: 'Tis like every thing which signifies nothing. To say a Man can be of two Religions, is a Contra∣diction, unless there be two Gods to Worship, or he has two Souls to saue.</P>
<P>Religion is the sacred Profession of the Name of God; <HI>serving him, believing in him, expecting from him;</HI> and like the God it refers to, 'tis in one and the same Ob∣ject, one and the same thing perfectly indivisible and inseparable there is in it no Neuter Gender, no Am∣biguous Article, <HI>God or Baal;</HI> Mediums are impossible.</P>
<P>As to the different Modes and Ways, which are the Circumstantials of this Sacred Thing I call Reli∣gion; I won't say, but that as Ships take different Courses at Sea, yet to the best of their Skill, keeping to the direct Rules of Navigating by the Compass, they may arrive at the same Port; so Christians ta∣king different Methods in the serving this God, yet going to the best of their Judgments by the direct Rules of the Scripture, may arrive at the same Hea∣ven; <HI>but this is nothing at all to the Case;</HI> for no Ship would arrive at any Port that sailed two ways toge∣ther, <HI>if that were possible;</HI> nor no man can serve One God, and at the same time hold two Opinions. There is but one Best, and he that gives God <HI>two Bests,</HI> gives him the Best and the Worst, and one Spoils t'other, till both are good for nothing.</P>
<P>I have said already, that both the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and the Dissenter, suffer in their Reputation
<PB N="143" REF="140"/>
for the mixt Multitudes of their Members, which is occasion'd by their present Prosperity: If a Third Party were to tyrannize over them both, we should see then who were <HI>Professors,</HI> and who were <HI>Confessors;</HI> but now it cannot be: Wherefore, I think 'twere well to put both Sides in mind of one thing, which they are bound mutually to observe; and that is, That <HI>the Per∣sonal Miscarriages of any particular Person or Member, is not really any Reflection upon the Religion they profess,</HI> nor ought not to be so accounted, unless it be where such Miscarriages are the direct Dictates of the Do∣ctrines they teach; and thus I would be understood in the present Case. Wherefore I shall give my Essay as to what I understand a Real Dissenting <HI>Protestant</HI> is, or ought to be.</P>
<P><HI>He who Dissents from an Establish'd Church on any ac∣count, but from a real Principle of Conscience, is a Politick, not a Religious Dissenter.</HI> To explain my self; He who Dissents from any other Reasons, but such as these, That he firmly believes the said Established Church is not of the purest Institution, but that he can real∣ly serve God more agreeable to his Will, and that ac∣cordingly 'tis his Duty to do it so, <HI>and no otherwise.</HI> Nay, he that cannot Dye, or at least desire to do so, rather than Conform, <HI>ought to Conform. Schism</HI> from the Church of Christ is, doubtless, a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it, but if not, the Cause of that Sin carries the Guilt with it.</P>
<P>But if I shall thus Dissent, and yet at the same time Conform; by Conforming I deny my Dissent being lawful, or by my Dissenting I damn my Conforming as sinful.</P>
<P>Nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the same time; if it be not lawful for me to Dissent, I ought to Conform; but if it be unlawful for me to Conform, I must Dissent; several Opinions may at the same
<PB N="144" REF="141"/>
time consist in a Country, in a City, in a Family, but not in one entire Person, <HI>that is impossible.</HI></P>
<P>To come to the point; there are Dissenters who are separated from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and join'd in Communion with Dissenting Churches or Congre∣gations. They have appear'd Zealous, Conscienti∣ous, and Constant; have born the Reproaches and Inconveniences of their Party, nay, suffer'd Persecu∣tion, and Loss of Estates and Liberty for the Cause: And who could have so little Charity as to doubt the Sincerity of their Profession? And yet these Persecu∣ted, Suffering Dissenters, to make themselves room in the Publick Advancements, and Glittering Gaw∣dy Honours of the Age, shall Conform to that which they refus'd under all those Disadvantages to do be∣fore. And which is worse than all this; hear O Hea∣vens! as soon as the present Honour is attain'd, the present Advantage made, they return to the former Circumstances again, and are freely receiv'd, <HI>a double Crime,</HI> as having done no Evil.</P>
<P>I know not, I profess, what these Persons can say for themselves, and therefore cannot pretend to An∣swer their Objections; but I cannot omit one Answer which some People give for them, <HI>viz. That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion, but done as a Civil Action,</HI> in Obedience to the Laws of the Land, which have made it a necessary Characteristick Quality, for ad∣mittance into publick Employments, which they think it their Duty to accept in order to serve their Coun∣try, which they doubly perform by Executing those Offices to the publick Interest, and by excluding those who would otherwise get into those places, and be∣tray their Country and their Liberties.</P>
<P>I have never met with any considerable Excuse made for this fast and loose Game of Religion, but this, and this I desire to consider a little particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion, but done</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="142"/>
<HI>as a Civil Action.</HI> How this can be possible remains to be determined. 'Tis true, the Morality of an Action consists in its End; but I cannot conceive that an Action purely and originally Religious, such as the Solemn Ordinances of God's Worship, can be made Civil Actions by any End, Design, Will, or In∣tention of Man whatsoever. 'Tis true, an Oath, which is a calling God to witness, is an Action both Civil and Religious, but still that was appointed and instituted to that end, as is expresly noted, <HI>Heb. Naaman</HI>'s bowing in the House of <HI>Rimmon;</HI> to which the Prophet answered, <HI>Go in Peace,</HI> which is under∣stood as a permission, is a thing still different; for <HI>Naaman</HI> only bowed for the Conveniency or State of the King, at the same time publickly disowning the Worship, as <HI>Interpreters are of Opinion;</HI> besides, bow∣ing the Head, tho' it may be a customary Act of Wor∣ship at that place, yet is no Act confin'd to Worship only, and instituted and directed so by the God who is Worshipped, but is an Act us'd in Common Salu∣tations. Thus we kneel to God, and to the King; but Sacraments are things appropriated by the Divine Institution of God himself, as things which have no other Signification or Import but what is Divine: Had <HI>Naaman</HI> desir'd to be excused in offering Sacri∣fices to the Idol <HI>Rimmon,</HI> the Prophet would hardly have bid him go in peace. Some Actions are not Ci∣vil or Religious, as they are Civilly or Religiously perform'd, but as they are Civil or Religious in them∣selves; for some Religious Actions are so entirely such, that they cannot without a horrid invasion of the Soveraignty of the Institutor be appropriated to any other use; and such are in especial manner, the Two Sacraments instituted by Christ, such was, be∣fore Christ, the Sacrifices by Fire; And the Judg∣ments of God on <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Ahihu,</HI> for attempting to offer Sacrifice with strange Fire, stands as a terrible
<PB N="146" REF="143"/>
Instance of what we ought to think is the Will of God in this matter.</P>
<P>Further, speaking directly of the Sacraments, Are they not the same thing, tho' differently Administred in the establish'd Church, or in a dissenting Church? and how can you take it as a Civil Act in one place, and a Religious Act in another? This is <HI>playing-Bopeep</HI> with God Almighty, and no Man can tell of them when they are about a Civil Action, and when about a Religious. But to answer this pretence at once, Sacraments as Sacraments are Religious Acts, and can be no other, if you do not take it as a Sacrament the Case differs, but how can you say you do not take it as a Sacrament? An Oath is to be taken in the Sense of the Imposer, and a Sacrament, which is a Recogni∣tion of the most Sacred of Oaths, must be also taken in the Sense of the Imposer. If the Person Admini∣string declar'd at the Administration, <HI>He did not give it as a Sacrament, but only give you a bit of Bread and Draught of Wine as a Friend,</HI> or the like, this was something; but can a Minister deliver the Bread to you, and say, <HI>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> &amp;c. and you Kneeling with Reverence take it as such, and repeat the Responses at the Communion, and say <HI>A∣men</HI> to the Prayer, and say 'tis a Civil Action. This is such Bantering with Religion, as no Modest Chri∣stian can think of without Horror.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another part of the Apology is, That without it they cannot be admitted into Publick places of Trust; and if they were not admitted, such will get in as will betray their Country and Liberties, and they do it purely to secure their Country, which they think their Duty.</P>
<P><HI>These are Patriots indeed, that</HI> will <HI>damn their Souls to save their Countrey;</HI> a sort of a Publick Spirit hardly to be found in the World, and indeed a Non-entity in it self, for 'tis a Mistake; the Gentlemen who make
<PB N="147" REF="144"/>
this Answer, put the case wrong. For I would de∣sire such to Answer a few Questions. ear</P>
<P>If the Service of their Country be so d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e to them, pray why should they not chuse to expo their Bo∣dies and Estates for that Service, rather than their Souls?</P>
<P>The Penalty of the Law in accepting the Publick Employments is wholly Pecuniary; the difference lies here, <HI>they chuse the Trespassing on their Consciences, before the hazard of their Estates,</HI> as the least Evil; for 'tis plain, any Man who will suffer the Penalty, or run the Risque of it, which is all one, may excuse the con∣formity; for the Lord does not say, you shall so and so Conform, but if you do not Conform, you shall in∣cur such and such Penalties; any Man that will incur the Penalty, may commit the Trespass.</P>
<P>So that all this Compliance is not, To be admitted to Places, that they may be able to serve their Coun∣try, but to save the Five hundred pounds and other Penalties of that Act.</P>
<P N="2">2. Why, if we believe the Power of God to be Omnipotent, should we imagine that he is not able to protect our Country and Liberties, without our perpetrating so wicked an Act to secure them, <HI>as do∣ing Evil that Good may come,</HI> which is expresly for∣bidden.</P>
<P>But we are told again, This is in it self no Sinful Act, and therefore it is not doing Evil. This is ta∣citly answered before; tho' 'tis not a Sinful Act in it self, <HI>Yet 'tis either a Sinful Act in a Dissenter, or else his Dissenting before was a Sinful Act.</HI> For if he is satis∣fied he does well in Conforming now, why did he not before? There is but one Answer for that, which is, He is otherwise convinced; to which I reply, If that were true, he would then as a Convert continue in this New Communion; but 'tis evident the same Per∣sons return immediately to the former Profession as
<PB N="148" REF="145"/>
Dissenters, and they can have no such Excuse unless it be, that they were convinc'd and reconvinc'd, and then convinc'd again.</P>
<P>Some have the Folly to argue against the Law it self, as a most Notorious Imposition upon the Consci∣ences of Man, by making the Sacred Institutions of Christ a Drudge to Secular <HI>Interest,</HI> and a Cause of mens Sins, by leading them into Tempation; I could say enough to vindicate that part, tho I am no more reconcil'd to that Law, than other Men, but 'tis remote to our Argumnet: 'Tis an Act of Parliament, and what is so, is of every Man's own doing, and there∣fore 'tis just every one shou'd comply with the Terms, or suffer the Penalty; but here is no <HI>Penalty,</HI> if no Crime; <HI>if no Preferments are sought, no Honours accepted, there is no Crime;</HI> if Self denial was as practicable as Self advancement, here is no need of the <HI>Crime.</HI> So that they who do this, <HI>seek the Crime, that is the first Sin; then Morgage their Consciences to avoid the Penalty,</HI> and so add one Sin to another. But we are told by some, 'tis not against their <HI>Consciences,</HI> they hope both <HI>Par∣ties</HI> are Good <HI>Christians,</HI> there are differences between them which they don't understand nor meddle with, and their Consciences are very well satisfied to Com∣municate with either.</P>
<P>I would ask such, if their Consciences would serve to Communicate with the Church, why did they Sepa∣rate? For Communicating with the <HI>Dissenter,</HI> is not an Occasional or Casual thing, but an open declar'd breaking off from the <HI>Church</HI> Establisht. Now no Man can be said to separate from, and joyn to a thing at the same time; if your <HI>Conscience</HI> is satis∣fied in Joyning, it cannot be satisfied in Separating, unless you can suppose your Conscience to be satisfied and dissatisfied both together. If you have a Consci∣ence of any Religion at all, it must be of some Reli∣gion or other; if of this, it cannot be of that, if of
<PB N="149" REF="146"/>
sent and Approve, are different Acts, and can never be fixt upon the same Object at the same time; as for a Man, Passively Religious, that can Communicate any where, that Man may from the same Principle, and with far less Guilt Communicate no where, for such a Man, in down-right <HI>English,</HI> has Prostituted the lit∣tle Religion he had, <HI>if ever he had any,</HI> to his Interest, and may be <HI>Turk, Jew, Papist,</HI> or any thing.</P>
<P>The latter part of the Charge leads me to consider another Point, which relates to the Assemblies of the Dissenters, who admit, and by consequence approve this way of proceeding. I do not pretend to examine by what Methods such particular Churches do procced. And I would be as tender as possible in making Re∣flections. I wish they would be as Charitable in cen∣suring this Reproof.</P>
<P>I do think, with Submission, 'tis impossible to prove that any Person, whose Case the foregoing Paragraph reaches, can be receiv'd again into Church-Communi∣on in a Dissenting Assembly upon any other Terms, <HI>than as a Penitent.</HI> I have heard of some, who have been said to have leave from their Ministers for this Matter; <HI>if so,</HI> they have assum'd some <HI>Dispensing Au∣thority,</HI> which I believe does not appertain to the Mi∣nisterial Function, nor is not contain'd in the Mission of our Saviour. But I do not affirm, That any such thing has been really allow'd.</P>
<P>As to the Relation of Churches, and the Members thereof, one to another, as the Dissenters now Esta∣blish'd them; I am sure, the allowance of any Member in a Promiscuous Communion with the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and the Dissenter at the same time, is not pre∣tended to be allow'd, nor is it consistent with it self. 'Tis Preposterous, and Excentrick, and is Destructive of the very Foundation of the Dissenters Principles, as is already noted, concerning Schisms in the Church. In this Case, Charity can heal nothing, nor help no∣thing;
<PB N="150" REF="147"/>
'tis of absolute necessity that one Man be but of one side, at one and the same time. Either the Con∣formist will mar the Dissenter, or the Dissenter will mar the Conformist. For if I shall be admitted into the Communion of the Dissenter, and of the Church together; then the Dissenter must have some other Reason for being a Dissenter, than Purity of Worship.</P>
<P>Methinks Men should seem what they are; if a Man Dissent from the Church, let him do so; and his Principle being well grounded for such Dissent, let him hold it; if not well-grounded, let him leave it; if he cannot suffer one way, let him suffer another; and why should we not be as honest to God as our Coun∣try.</P>
<P>The Motives to serve our Country are strong, but there are ways to do it without such a Violation of all our Principles and Profession; if not, trust God's Providence with the Issue, who never wants Agents to preserve and deliver his People when his time is at hand; and you can have small hope to expect that the Office and Trust you shall Execute, shall receive any Assistance from his Providence, when the first Step into it, is made by offering the greatest Affront to his Honour, and committing the vilest Act of Per∣fidy in the World.</P>
<P>But if the gay Prospect of a great Place, tempt any Person beyond the Power that God's Grace is pleas'd to assist them with, <HI>in that way let him abide,</HI> and not be re-admitted, because of his Gold Ring, and Fine Apparel, without a Penitent Acknowledgement. The Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> can never pretend to be Dis∣senters upon the mere Principle of Purity of Worship, as I have related in the beginning of this Discourse, if such shall be receiv'd as blameless into their Com∣munion, who have deserted them upon the occasion of Preferment, and have made the Sacred Institutions of Christ Jesus, become Pimps to their Secular Interest,
<PB N="151" REF="148"/>
and then wipe their Mouths, and sit down in the Church, and say, <HI>They have done no Evil.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis also an Intolerable Affront to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> reflecting upon its Doctrine as well as Pra∣ctice; to make use of the Church for a <HI>Cover</HI> to fence them against the Laws, at the same time continuing to disown its Communion, as a thing not fit to be con∣tinued in.</P>
<P>And yet the Church of <HI>England</HI> is in the right to receive such of the Dissenters as shall come to them without the Ceremony of Recognition, because it is agreeable to the Notion of a National Church, which they profess to be. But Dissenters are bound to justi∣fie their Separation from them, or else their whole Constitution falls to the Ground. Now, how a Se∣paration and a Conformity are Consistent, is to me an Inexplicable Riddle.</P>
<P>I question not here the Lawfulness of the Dissen∣ters Separation; it is not the business of this Discourse to define it; and I am as careful as I can in making Reflections upon either; but I am bold to affirm, That no Dissenting Church can with lawful Cause Separate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> Establish Private Chur∣ches or Communions, and at the same times allow the Members to Conform to the Establish'd Church too: This is incongruous, and one must destroy the other. From whence I think it becomes the Dissenters, if they would maintain the Doctrine they teach; if they would have us believe they Dissent purely on the honest Principles of Conscience, and Purity of Worship, with such a one, <HI>No, not to Eat.</HI> And it is not sufficient that the Offender a Lord Mayor, or any greater Person; unless he would be Lord Mayor without a Breach of the Sacred Relation he had entred into, he should be dealt with in that Case, as the meanest Member of such a Society.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if a Man be call'd upon to be a
<PB N="152" REF="149"/>
Magistrate, and has Courage enough to follow the Impartial Dictates of his Conscience, a Query lies be∣fore him, What shall he do?</P>
<P>The Case is plain; <HI>Either refuse the Honour, or run the Risque.</HI> The first indeed is the plainest and easiest Way, and the Ground of it is good, for he whose Con∣cience Dictates to him that the Terms are Sinful, may refuse the Call; for Preferments and Honours are a Bait that some have refused on meer Points of Specu∣lative Philosophy; and 'tis hard, Christianity shou'd not carry a Man as far. Well, but <HI>perhaps a Man has a mind to be a Sheriff or a Lord Mayor,</HI> and is a Dissen∣ter; or perhaps he really thinks 'tis his Indispensable Duty to serve his Country, if he is call'd to that, or the like Office; or perhaps he thinks 'tis a Duty he owes his Family, to advance his Children, and the like, and he is a Profest Dissenter: What shall he do? Let him boldly run the Risque, or openly and honestly Conform to the Church, and neither be asham'd of his Honour, nor of his Profession; such a Man all Men will Value, and God will own: He need not fear car∣ying the Sword to a Conventicle, or bringing the Conventicle to his own House. But to make the mat∣ter a Game, to dodge Religions, and go in the Morn∣ing to Church, and in the Afternoon to the Meeting; to Communicate in private with the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to save a Penalty, and then go back to the Dis∣senters and Communicate again there: This is such a Retrograde Devotion, that I can see no colour of pre∣tence for in all the Sacred Book.</P>
<P>I have heard, indeed, that some, who are Ministers of Dissenting Churches do, or did at the same time Communicate with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I do not dispute how far a Minister may Conform as a Lay∣man, tho' he cannot as a Clergy-man; but how any Dissenting Minister can Conform as a Lay-man, and at the same time execute a Pastoral Charge over a
<PB N="153" REF="150"/>
Congregation, whom he teaches to Separate from the Church in a Lay-Communion, I cannot imagine.</P>
<P>'Tis not as I have already noted, Conformity or Nonconformity at the same time, in one and the same Person, <HI>that is the Point;</HI> and doing this for a Secular End, to save a Penalty, and privately; and then, as being asham'd of it, to go back and sit down as not having done it at all; and a Church-Society admitting this without taking notice of it; these are the Con∣tradictions I must upon, and rather wish, than expect to see rectified.</P>

<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO Occasional Conformity. Shewing that the DISSENTERS Are no Way Concern'd in it.</HEAD>
<P>HE that Opposes his own Judgment against the Current of the Times, ought to be back'd with unanswerable Truths; and he that has that Truth on his Side, is a Fool, as well as a Coward, if he is afraid to own it because of the Currency or Multitude of other Mens Opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="151"/>
'Tis hard for a Man to say, all the World is mista∣ken but himself; but if it be so who can help it?</P>
<P>But since 'tis not likely a Single Vote shou'd pre∣vail upon Espous'd Errors, in an Age when every one is so fond of themselves, he that starts Truth by him∣self must expect the World will stand still and look on till they see the Issue.</P>
<P>The Act depending in the House of Commons about Occasional Conformity has set abundance of Heads to Work in the World; and be the House in the Right, or in the Wrong, I know my own Business, and their Temper too well to meddle with it: But I pretend to say, that all Men I have met with, who have med∣dled with the Argument, either in Print or otherwise, are manifestly Mistaken.</P>
<P>With more Humility therefore than I owe to any Man, I ask leave not to be Censur'd till I am Heard; and those who call me Arrogant before, reprove me with more Arrogance than is their share among their Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>But since I, <HI>who was altogether Born in Sin,</HI> have un∣dertaken to teach my Superiors, I desire to explain my self before they cast me out of the Synagogue.</P>
<P>For as that Blind Man thought 'twas a Marvellous thing they should not know whence he came that had opened his Eyes.</P>
<P>So to me 'tis every jot as wonderful to find no Bo∣dy of my Mind, and yet be Positively assured that I am in the Right.</P>
<P>The Subject I am upon needs no Introduction, the History is in every Mans Knowledge; the Parliament are upon a Bill to prevent Occasional Conformity, and about that Bill the Press swarms with Pamphlets; the Pulpit sounds with Exaltations on one Hand, and Deprecations on the other; every one speak their O∣pinions, some their Hopes, some their Fears, and so it shou'd have been to the end of the Chapter, if I cou'd
<PB N="155" REF="152"/>
have found but one middle Sort, that, free from Pre∣judice of Parties, cou'd have discern'd the Native State of the Case as it really is, discover'd from the Passions and Follies of Men.</P>
<P>About their Act of Parliament I affirm most of the People I have met with are Mistaken; and that I may be as Explicit as I can, I shall enquire more particular∣ly who are mistaken, how, and then I doubt not the Sequel of this Paper shall make it appear that the Fact is true.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> All those People who design'd the Act as a Blow to the Dissenting Interest in <HI>England;</HI> are mi∣staken.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All those who take it as a Prelude or In∣troduction to the further Suppressing of the Dissen∣ters, and a Step to Repealing the Toleration, or intend it as such, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> All those who think the Dissenters at all concern'd in it, or have design'd to Mortifie them by it, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> All those Hot-Spurs of Divinity who Pro∣phesie Destruction from the Pulpit, and from this Step pretend to foretel that the time of Plund'ring their Brethren is at Hand, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> All those Flegmatick Dissenters who fancy themselves undone, and that Persecution and Desola∣tion is at the Door again, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> All those Dissenters, who are really at all Disturb'd at it, either as an Advantage gain'd by their Enemies, or as a real Disaster upon themselves, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> All those Dissenters who Deprecate it as a Judgment, or wou'd Vote against it, if it were in their Power, are Mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> That all those who begun or promoted this Bill with a Design to Ruin, Weaken and Destroy the Interest or Body of the Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> are Mistaken.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="153"/>
Not that I hereby suppose the Parliament or the Persons Originally concern'd in moving this Bill, did it in meer Kindness to the Dissenters, in order to Re∣fine and Purge them from the Scandals, which some People had brought upon them, that 'twas an Action of Christian Charity to the Dissenters, to Prevent and Detect Frauds and Hypocrisie in Religion, and to clear their Reputation.</P>
<P>I never yet saw or read of a Division of Parties in any Nation, but the Hot Heads of both Parties were always for Enflaming the Reckoning; if the Hot Men of the Dissenters have done any Mischief, I am sorry for it; but let us Examine a little what other Hot Men wou'd be now a doing.</P>
<P>No sooner was Queen <HI>Ann</HI> settl'd upon the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> and had declar'd that the Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> shou'd be the Men of Her Favour, as being the Church She had been Educated in, and ever constant to, but these Hot Men fly out upon their Brethren with all the Excesses of their furious Temper.</P>
<P>Nothing wou'd serve them, but this Queen and Parliament must, Root and Branch, blast the Dissen∣ters with their Breath, blow up their Interest in the Nation, and we shou'd be all one Church and one Peo∣ple, of a sudden; 'twas to be done with a Blow all at once, and so certainly, that no possible Doubt could be made of it.</P>
<P>But Her Majesty was pleas'd to let these People know from Her own Mouth, that for as much as con∣cerned Her, they were Mistaken; in that, upon the Address of the Dissenters to Her, She gave them Her Royal Word for Her Protection, and whenever She breaks it, we shall all be Mistaken.</P>
<P>Upon this the Pulpit, that Drum Ecclesiastick be∣gan the War, and Mr. <HI>Sachavrell,</HI> in his Sermon at <HI>Oxford,</HI> Dooms all the Dissenters to Destruction, with∣out either Bell, Book, or Candle; not regarding com∣mon
<PB N="157" REF="154"/>
Decency, not respecting his good Manners to the Queen, nor his Deference to the Parliament; but tells them 'tis their Duty, if they will be true Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to lift up a Standard against the Phanaticks, and the like; as much as to say, <HI>Ma∣dam, whatever your Majesty has promis'd, You must break Your Word;</HI> and <HI>Gentlemen of the House of Commons, we will have you do it.</HI></P>
<P>Now all these Gentlemen have liv'd to see them∣selves Mistaken; and if they retain any Expectations of seeing it fulfill'd, they must exercise their Faith upon it, as a thing <HI>in Futuro,</HI> and believe that some time or other Her Majesty will break her Word; but as yet there is no great Probability, for hitherto we have seen we are all mistaken.</P>
<P>But to revive their Expectations, comes a Bill into the House for preventing Occasional Conformity, this has been matter of great Triumph to some Gentle∣men, who upon this Act revive their common Dis∣course, and are pleas'd to treat the Dissenters in this manner: <HI>Well, Gentlemen, now down you go, the Parlia∣ment are a beginning with you, and they don't use to do Bu∣siness by halves, they have taken the Insulted Church into Consideration, they will reduce you, and this is the first Step, you shall soon see some more on't: We have got a Church Parliament now, and down ye go, this Bill will effectually Ruin your Interest, and bring all your Great Men off from you.</HI></P>
<P>This brings us close to the Point; and 'tis no small matter for any one to show these Gentlemen how they are mistaken.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> 'Tis time for these Gentlemen to tell us what the Parliament will do when they either know it, or the House has declar'd their Intentions; and till they have, 'tis a Presumption some Houses would have ta∣ken Notice of, for any People to pretend to lead them to their Business; and therefore when they tell us this
<PB N="158" REF="155"/>
is a Taste of the rest they are preparing for us, I must say, either they are too well acquainted with the Mind of the House, or they are all Mistaken; and as to the Blow this Bill is to the Dissenters Interest in <HI>England,</HI></P>
<P>As far as I may be allow'd to give my Judgement, and as the Nature of the Thing seems to speak its self; 'tis plain this Bill is no Damage at all to the Dis∣senters in <HI>England,</HI> and we hope the House did not intend it as such.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine that so great a Spirit of Enmity and contempt can be entertain'd in the Breast of a Nation against their Neighbours, their Brethren, Peo∣ple Born in the same Climate, submitting to the same Government, professing the same God, and in most Fundamental Points of Religion agreeing, People link'd together in the same common Interest, by in∣termarriages continually mixt in Relation, concern'd in the same Trade, making War with the same Ene∣mies, and Allied with the same Friends; were it not that these People, call'd Dissenters, are represented to them under some strange and untrue Character, or that under the Name of Dissenter, some ill Persons are shrowded and disguis'd, who deserve to be thus Treated.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in order to set the Dissenters Right in the Eyes of their Brethren, and that they may have com∣mon Justice at least, if they can have nothing of Cour∣tesie, that Peace may be where there is no Occasion for War, and Quietness, and good Manners preser∣ved, 'twill be needful to set the Matter in a true Light, and examine who this Dissenter is, what the People Dissenters are, and what they have done, for which they are Treated after so infamous a Manner by Scurrilous Preachers, and Scandalous Pamphleteers, and other ignorant People, not a few.</P>
<P>The Dissenter is an <HI>Englishman,</HI> that being some∣thing
<PB N="159" REF="156"/>
desirous of going to Heaven, having heard his Church of <HI>England</HI> Father, and School-master, and the Minister of the Parish, talk much of it, begins se∣riously to enquire about the Way thither, and to that Purpose consulting his Bible and his Conscience, he finds that in his Opinion there are some Things in the Establish'd Way of Worship, which do not seem to correspond with the Rule he has found out in the Scripture.</P>
<P>Now I shall not examine here whether the Man thus scrupulous be in the Right, or whether the Church be in the Right, it does not at all belong to the Case in Hand.</P>
<P>But the Man being fully convinc'd that he ought to Worship God in that Way, exclusive of all others, which is most agreeable to the Will of God reveal'd in the Scripture; and being on mature Consideration also, and after sincere Endeavours to be otherwise sa∣tisfied, fully convinc'd that this Establish'd Way is not so near to that Rule as it ought to be, ventures the Displeasure of the Civil Magistrate in Dissenting, in pure Obedience to the Commands of his Conscience, and of that Rule which bids him obey God rather than Man; firmly believing that 'tis his Duty so to do; and that the Compass and Extent of Humane Laws do not reach to bind him in Matters of Conscience; at the same time living in Charity with all the rest of the World whose Consciences do not require the same Restriction, and Peaceably submitting to the Laws and Government he lives under, as far as either his Right, as an <HI>Englishman,</HI> or his Duty as a Christian, can require.</P>
<P>This is the <HI>English</HI> Protestant Dissenter which I have been speaking of, and concerning whom I have ven∣tur'd to say, so many Men, <HI>so much Wiser than I,</HI> are Mistaken.</P>
<P>If there are crept into his Company State Dissen∣ters,
<PB N="160" REF="157"/>
Politick Dissenters, or any that give no Reason or other, or less Reasons, for their Dissenting than these, they are not of them, and we wish they would go out from them.</P>
<P>I see no Act of Parliament a making to the Preju∣dice of this Dissenter; and let Hot Men, Preach, Print, and Say, what they please, it is impossible it shou'd ever enter into the Breast of an <HI>English</HI> Protestant Par∣liament, or an <HI>English</HI> Protestant Queen, either to Op∣press or Suppress such a Dissenter.</P>
<P>'Tis for the Protection of this Honest, Well-mea∣ning Dissenter, that in the late Reign the King and Parliament finding their Number Great, thought it was Meet for the Quiet of the Nation, and as an Ac∣knowledgement of the Superiority of Conscience to all Humane Laws, to Settle their Liberty in an Act of Parliament; the same undisputed Authority on which all our Civil, as well as Religious, Rights are Esta∣blished.</P>
<P>This is the Dissenter to which Her Majesty has promised Her Protection, and this Act of Parliament is the Toleration to Tender Consciences, for which Her Majesty openly declar'd Her Self, even to the Ha∣zard of Her Royal Person.</P>
<P>These are the Dissenters who never gave Her Ma∣jesty any Reason to believe they did not Merit Her Protection, and I firmly believe never will.</P>
<P>From these the Church of <HI>England</HI> has nothing to fear, unless their Exemplary Lives, and Unquestion'd Piety, shou'd prevail to weaken Her Numbers, and we heartily wish all the Strife were reduc'd to this, <HI>viz.</HI> who shou'd Live best, and who shou'd Preach best.</P>
<P>If there are among them Vicious Youths, or Grown Hypocrites; if there are crept in Errors, Heresies and Enthusiasts; are not the same among the Church? If there are among these Dissenters, <HI>Quakers, Antinomi∣ans, Sweet-Singers, Muggletonians,</HI> and the like; the
<PB N="161" REF="158"/>
Church has also Her <HI>Socinians, Deists, Anti-Trinitari∣ans, Scepticks, Asgilites,</HI> and the like; there can be no Advantage pleaded against Heresie, and Damnable Heterodox Opinions, from one side more than another.</P>
<P>If we regard the Matters of State, the Dissenters, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have small Advantage of the Argument one against another; and I may with∣out Arrogance Challenge the Hot Church-Men, who can Treat them with nothing but the Odious Name of Disturbers of the Peace, Enemies of Monarchy, and Authors of Confusion, to bring the Loyalty of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> so much boasted of in the World, to the Test, with the Loyalty of the Dissenter; <NOTE PLACE="marg">New Test of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty. <HI>P.</HI></NOTE> and as it has lately been done to my Hand, it is easie to prove that the Dissenter has been equally Loyal to Princes, equally True to the Government and Constituti∣on of <HI>England,</HI> as the Church; and the Church has been equally Disloyal, and has as often Re∣sisted, and took Arms against the Lawful Establish'd Power and Prince, as the Dissenter; and let them en∣ter into this Dispute whenever they please.</P>
<P>But what is all this to the present Case? What we do as <HI>Englishmen</HI> is one thing, and what we do as Chri∣stians, and Dissenters, is another.</P>
<P>'Tis also Foreign to our Purpose to Examine or Re∣ply to Dr. <HI>Stubbs,</HI> or the Multitude of Pamphleteers, who place themselves at the forelorn Hope of the Church, and begin the War in hopes of drawing on that whole Body to an Engagement; when they can make it out, that the Dissenter and the Church are as far asunder in Religion as God and <HI>Baal,</HI> I may possib∣ly think they Merit what they so much Covet, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Reply'd to.</P>
<P>Whole Reams of Paper are spoil'd since that to prove that this Act of Parliament is needful, because 'tis fit the Church should be Establish'd; to which I
<PB N="162" REF="159"/>
Answer with a Question ask'd once with much less Reason in another Case, <HI>What need all this Waste?</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen, Establish your Church with all the Pre∣caution you can, Build a Fence of Impregnable Laws about it, you are welcome; we never did, nor we do not now, Disturb you; leave but us, your Poor Bre∣thren, Liberty to serve God according to our Con∣sciences; don't bind us to do as you can do, whether we can or no; take your Places, and Pensions, and Profits, and deserve them of the Nation, if you can, we ask nothing but our Right, and what is now be∣come so by Law; if you claim the Civil Power as yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> own, you consequently take us into your Protection▪ and let us see how Generous you'll be.</P>
<P>As to those among us who can conform to yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> Church for a Place, for a Salary, you are also Wel∣come to take them among you, and let them be a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of your selves; all the Converts you can make by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mammon of Unrighteousness are your own; all yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can Buy off, or Bribe off, or Fright off, <HI>let 'em go;</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> readily Grant, that whoever among us can, with Sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣faction to his Conscience Conform, ought to Confor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and we heartily Wish you would make some smal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Steps by way of Condescention to your Brethre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such as might open a Door for us all to Conform t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you, and then you shou'd Dissent from Principles o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Obstinacy and Ill-Nature, or from a meer Necessity of Conscience you should then see whether the Dissen∣ters in <HI>England</HI> were Schismaticks by Nature, and He∣terdox by Inclination; or whether their Objectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> are grounded upon Scripture, and their Dissenting from you an Act of an enlightned Conscience; yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wou'd then try the Spirits whether they be of God.</P>
<P>But since you are of the Opinion that you are capa∣ble of no Amendment, that you cannot Reform far∣ther, and therefore will not Condescend one Step, tho' 'twould bring over Half a Million of Souls to you▪
<PB N="163" REF="160"/>
<HI>an Eminent Instance of the Charity of your Church,</HI> all we have to say in the Case is, let us have the Protection of the Government, and the Liberty the Laws allow us, and we are Content.</P>
<P>Upon this Score 'tis that we say the Act against Oc∣casional Conformity does not concern us; they who can Conform for One Reason, may conform without Two, and ought to Conform; and we are therefore content to be distinguish'd who cannot Conform at all; and if we might offer so boldly to you, who have any Interest in the <HI>House of Commons,</HI> we would humbly propose to have the Title of the Act alter'd, and to have it Entituled, <HI>An Act for the better Ʋniting the Pro∣testant Dissenters, by preventing Occasional Conformity to the Church of</HI> England; and when that is done, let it pass with all our Hearts; and tho' we can easily see what the Design is, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Dissenter shall be employ'd in Place of Trust or Profit in the Govern∣ment, yet since it must be so, <HI>We hope, Gentlemen, you will be content to take all the Miscarriages of the Govern∣ment on you too;</HI> we shall acquiesce, let us alone in our Religion, let us Worship God as we believe he has directed us, and all the rest is your own.</P>
<P>But before we part let us have leave to remind you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat although you are willing to quit all our Civil Right to the Honours, as well as the Advantages, of serving our Country, when we are chosen to it by a fair Majority, rather than not enjoy our Religion, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Profession we make, with Peace and Liberty, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is no less an Oppression upon us, and the Hardships <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re such as can never be defended by Reason or Equi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</P>
<P>We would be glad we had no Cause to think our selves Injur'd; and to such of the Church of <HI>England</HI> who can judge without Prejudice, we would Appeal whether it is not very Hard.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Dissenter shall be excluded from all
<PB N="164" REF="161"/>
Places of Profit, Trust and Honour, and at the same time shall not be excused from those which are attend∣ed with Charge, Trouble, and Loss of his Time?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That a Dissenter shall be Press'd as a Sai∣lor to Fight at Sea, Listed as a Soldier to Fight on Shore, and let his Merit be never so much above his Fellows, shall never be capable of Preferment; no, not a Lieutenant at Sea, or so much as a Halbert in the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That we must maintain our own Clergy, and your Clergy; our own Poor, and your Poor; pay equal Taxes, and equal Duties; and not be thought worthy to be Trusted to set a Drunkard in the Stocks.</P>
<P>We wonder, Gentlemen, you will accept our Mo∣ney on your Deficient Funds, our Stocks to help car∣ry on your Wars, our Loans and Credits to your Victualling Office, and Navy Office.</P>
<P>If you would go on to distinguish us, get a Law made we shall Buy no Lands, that we may not be Free∣holders; and see if you could find Money to Buy us out.</P>
<P>Transplant us into Towns and Bodies, and let us Trade by our selves; let us Card, Spin, Knit, and Work, with and for one another, and see how you will maintain your own Poor without us.</P>
<P>Let us Fraight our Ships apart, keep our Money out of your Bank, accept none of our Bills, and sepe∣rate your selves as absolutely from us in Civil Matters, as we do from you in Religious, and see how you can go on without us.</P>
<P>If you are not willing to do this, but we must live among you, Trade, Work, Receive and Pay, together, why may we not do it in Peace, with Love and Uni∣ty, without daily Reproach? If we have any Knaves among us, take them, if we have any Hypocrites, any who can Conform, and do not, we are free to part with them, that the Remainder may be all such as
<PB REF="162"/>
agree with the Character here given; and when you have Garbl'd us to your Hearts desire, and ours, you need never fear your Church, as to her Politick Inte∣rest in the World; Pray then let us be quiet.</P>
<P>What have we to do with your Distinctions of Whig and Tory? No farther that I know of than this, that when, distinct from our Religious Concerns, we come to talk of our Liberties, Properties, and <HI>English</HI> Pri∣viledges, we are not for having them destroy'd by Ab∣solute Authority, Dispensing Power, and the like; and if this be to be Whigs, ye are Whigs.</P>
<P>As to Kings and Rulers, we are of the Opinion, that when they Degenerate into Tyrants, Oppress their People, Destroy the Laws, with all the <HI>et caetera</HI>'s of Arbitrary Power, 'tis Lawful for the Injur'd People to Reduce them to Reason, and to seek Protection, and Powerful Help, from any Body, to Assist them to Recover their Undoubted Rights and Liberties; if this be to be Traitors, why then, Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> hold up your Hands; how say you? Are you Guilty, or not Guilty?</P>
<P>As to Oaths, <HI>with which, Gentlemen, ye were the Men that loaded your Allegiance farther than you had any Occa∣sion,</HI> we are of the Opinion, that they can bind the Sub∣ject no longer than the Soveraign continues the Pro∣tection of the Executive Power; and that the late King by his Deserting the Throne, Absolv'd all his Subjects from the Bond of their Allegiance; and on this Foot we made no Scruple to Swear to the Government, as it now stands on the Foot of the late Revolution; and if you have Sworn with us, and yet do not believe so, you may get off of the Perjury if you can.</P>
<P>And what need is there now of running down the Dissenters with a full Cry, as if this Act a coming out was a Machine to blow them all up; we see no Harm in it at all, other than the Hardships we mention'd be∣fore, most of which we suffer'd before, and are like
<PB N="166" REF="163"/>
only to have them the faster entail'd on our Po∣sterity.</P>
<P>All those Gentlemen therefore who think this Act will weaken the Dissenters, or wish it would, are ma∣nifestly Mistaken; it may distinguish them better, and I am perswaded will fortifie them in their Honest Pro∣fession; 'twill teach them, that if they will hold fast the Truth, they must learn to live like People under the Power of those who hate them, and despitefully use them.</P>
<P>The Dissenters too are strangely Mistaken in their Apprehensions of the Ill Consequences of this Act.</P>
<P>To such I wou'd say, I cannot imagine what they have to fear from it, or why they shou'd be uneasie with the Honour they are also rid of, the Encumbrance of being Mayors, Aldermen, Jurats, and Sheriffs of the Towns and Corporations; and let them but reflect what was the Gain that all the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> have made by Places and Pensions from the Govern∣ment since the late Revolution, I am perswaded 'twill not all amount to the Sum that one Churchman will be found to have Cheated the Nation of.</P>
<P>The Church are willing to engross all the Knaves to themselves, and let them do it, and welcome, tho' they get all the Money into the Bargain; if they would but come to a fair Account with us now, and repay all the Dissenters Money the Nation has been Cheated of by Church Knaves, I dare undertake the Dissenters shall repay all that can be charg'd on their Knaves out of the Ballance.</P>
<P>The Foundation of the Dissenters Safety is lodg'd, by God's Especial Providence, in the Queen's Veraci∣ty; while Her Majesty esteems Her Word Sacred, as She has assur'd us She will, we have no Occasion to be concern'd at all.</P>
<P>The Safety of the Dissenters consist in their own Honesty and Integrity; while they do nothing to of∣fend
<PB N="167" REF="164"/>
either Her Majesty, or the Laws, if it were pos∣sible to have a Parliament of Church Bigots, or of Pulpit <HI>Sachaverells,</HI> there will be no Fear of their Li∣berty.</P>
<P>As to the present Act, I doubt not but they will live to see Cause to be thankful for the making it, when the Miscarriages of all People in Publick Offices and Employments are so eminently fix'd upon a Party, and so openly and fairly taken off from them.</P>
<P>They are Mistaken too in the Sence of the Present Parliament; and they may be assur'd, had not their Enemies seen that an <HI>English</HI> Protestant Parliament, as this is, is not to be prevail'd upon to Overthrow so Substantial a Part of the Nations Liberty as is setled in the Act of Toleration, they had not rested so long, but before now had attempted it.</P>
<P>They have try'd it in the Pulpit, scatter'd it in Scandalous Pamphlets from the Press, affirmed that Toleration is Destructive of the Churches, as well as the Nations Safety; they have endeavour'd, by Ca∣lumny and Reproach to blacken the Dissenters with Crimes never committed; and which they wou'd ne∣ver own before, are at last come to represent them as a formidable Party.</P>
<P>And yet all this cou'd never bring so much as One Member of the House to be so blind to his Countries Interest, as to make a Motion against the Act of Toleration.</P>
<P>Being thus disappointed, and willing to play at small Game rather than stand out, they fly to the Sanctuary of this Bill, and feign themselves gratify'd by it more than ever the Bill, or the House it self, intended; for in all their Arguments for the Bill, 'tis suppos'd to be a Means to Reduce, Humble, and Mortifie the Dis∣senters; <HI>Ridiculus Mus!</HI> Is this all? Why really, Gen∣tlemen, had it been in our Power, you should have had all this without an Act of Parliament; this will
<PB N="168" REF="165"/>
Strengthen, not Reduce, us; 'twill please, not Mor∣tifie or Humble, us; and thus you find your selves all Mistaken, Mistaken in the House of Commons them∣selves, in thinking the Representatives of a Protestant Nation will Repeal the Act of Toleration, upon which the Tranquility of their Native Country so much depends, but above all Mistaken in their Ex∣pectation of the Queen, to whom their Behaviour is Preposterous and Unmannerly.</P>
<P>'Twas preposterous for People to expect, that be∣cause the Queen was a Friend to the Church, a con∣stant Member, and always Espoused the Interest of the Church, that therefore when She came to the Crown, She must come up to all their extravagant Heights.</P>
<P>When Her Majesty was Princess, and a Subject, she constantly adher'd to the Interest of the Church; but at the same time declar'd Her Opinion for tolerating the Dissenters in their Liberty of Protestant Worship, while they behaved themselves quietly and obediently under the Government.</P>
<P>When Her Majesty came to the Crown, She became the general Mother, the Guardian, the Refuge of all Her Subjects; She places the Church first in Her Fa∣vour, promises them Her special and particular care, as those who by Judgment and Inclination She stands engaged with; but as She finds a great Number of Her People unhappily divided in Opinion, yet in all other Respects Her good Subjects, what can She do less than give them Her Protection? This She has readily promis'd them, and on this they thankfully depend,</P>
<P>But here comes the Gentlemen of the Long Gown, and they tell her in so many Words, She cannot, She must not keep her Word with us; They tell us She will halt between God and <HI>Baal,</HI> if She does not so De∣clare for the Church, as to her Best to Suppress and destroy all Separate Worships, and have all the Priests
<PB N="169" REF="166"/>
of <HI>Baal,</HI> the best Terms they can bestow on the Dis∣senting Ministers, hew'd to Pieces before the Lord.</P>
<P>'Tis Unmannerly that the Church of <HI>England-</HI>men shou'd expect the Queen to break Her word with some of Her Subjects to oblige others; and that whereas She has promis'd them Her Special Favour, they shou'd not be content with that, unless She will at the same time Oppress Two Millions of her Faithful People to oblige them.</P>
<P>Let them go on, but let them be assur'd the Dissen∣ters shall enjoy their Liberty of Conscience, till they can prevail with Her Majesty to lay aside her Veraci∣ty, and forget Her Royal Word, and refuse us Her Protection, which we are resolved never to give Her any Reason for.</P>
<P>As to the Bill against Occasional Conformity, it baulks their Design on the Dissenters, for 'tis for their Advantage; they always dislik'd the Practice; it has more than once been Protested against, and Exploded, and I dare undertake not one Dissenter offers to present a Petition to the House against its passing.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that Occasional Communion is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a Dissenter; who, if he can Conform, ought to Conform; and if he can for a Place of Preferment, ought to do it without that Preferment.</P>
<P>'Tis plain, that whatever, by the Connivance of Remiss Ministers, and with too much Regard to Par∣ties, may have been slightly pass'd over, yet by the ve∣ry Constitution and Foundation of a collected, separate Church or Congregation, no Man can go back to the Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and be recei∣ved again upon any other Condition but as a Penitent; 'tis an Act Destructive of all possible Pretence for Dis∣senting and never was, nor never can, be defended by any Dissenter, without over-throwing all the Reasons they cou'd ever give for Dissenting.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="167"/>
How then can this Bill be aim'd at the Dissenters? either they who think 'tis aim'd at them, are Mista∣ken; or they that point it at them, are Mistaken, for Suppressing an Error crept in among them, contrary to their Constitution, against their Judgment, decla∣red by them to be a Grievance, can never be their In∣jury, nor ought to be their Trouble.</P>
<P>Let them Name us the Dissenter that ever vindica∣ted this Practice, one passionate Author excepted; let them tell us the Time when any Congregation recei∣ved such conforming Nonconformatists without dissa∣tisfactions and Discontents; let them tell us a Time whenever the thing was practic'd till the Reign of King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a Novelty, an Abuse crept in among us, and we are glad to have it Condemn'd by Authority; at the same Time not at all thinking our selves oblig'd to the Authors for their Good Will.</P>
<P>'Twill be objected, this is a Feint, to close with a thing when you cannot help it.</P>
<P>No, Gentlemen, we don't tell you we like that part of the Bill which Excludes us from the Native Honours and Preferments of our Country, which are our Due, our Birthright, equally with our Neighbours, and to which we should be call'd by the Suffrage of the People; and we cannot but think it a Hardship beyond the Power of Reason to justifie; but since this Right must be clogg'd with so many Inconveniencies, that we must Mortgage our Consciences to enjoy them, no Man can have any Charity left for us, but must presently conclude we shall freely forego such Trifles for our Consciences, or else that we may have no Consciences at all.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>'tis no Feint;</HI> we are so content with the Suppressing the Grievance of this Scandalous <HI>Am∣bo-dexter Conformity,</HI> that we think the Hardships put upon us with it not worth naming; we doubt not
<PB N="171" REF="168"/>
the Parliament will one time or other see Cause to do us Justice, and to restore to us the Priviledges of our Ancestors, and which we have done nothing to for∣feit.</P>
<P>But all the Parliaments that ever were, or will be, can never Suppress any thing among us so Scandalous to our Reputation, and to that Candour with which we desire to Guide our Actions, nor so Contrary to, and Destructive of, the very Nature of our separating from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Constitution of all our Collected Congregations.</P>
<P>We acknowledge, that if this was an allow'd Pra∣ctice among us, we cou'd not pretend the Character of a Dissenter I have here given to be Just; but with∣out Question it is a most Just Character of all those Dissenters who are Consciencious and Honest; 'tis the Original, the Nature, of a Dissenter; what is crept in more is a Corruption, and we wish it Extin∣guished; and since none has said any thing of this Nature but what has been said before, and no Church of <HI>England-</HI>Man can think or speak worse of it than the truly Religious Dissenters have done, we freely dismiss all those who can thus Build with one Hand, and Pull Down with another, to a Liberty of declar∣ing for the future who they are for.</P>
<P>Only pursuant to what has all along been acknow∣ledg'd, so far as we handl'd this Argument, if they wou'd accept of the Friendly Advice of their Bre∣thren, it should be, that they would for the future Conform to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For 'tis plain, he that can Conform to the Church to qualifie himself for Preferment, for Employment, or any such Reason, can Conform; if not, he must be arrived to a Degree of Mastership over his Conscience so as to subject it to his Interest, and act against light; and he that can do that, may do any thing, and 'tis no matter what Church he communicates with; of such
<PB N="172" REF="169"/>
a Man I think I Trespass not upon Charity to say, he has all his Work of Religion to do over again, and he also may Conform till God shall give his Consci∣ence Light enough to chuse by, and him Grace to be Obedient to the Convictions of his own Heart, and whether that be to Conform or Dissent, let him judge</P>
<P>But if any Man who has profest himself a Religious Dissenter, shall, upon the passing this Act, declare him∣self Resolv'd to turn to the Dissenters, I think no Con∣gregation of Dissenters, according to the Nature of Religious Communion, can receive him upon any o∣ther Terms than as a <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If he has not Sinn'd, why shou'd he Repent?</HI> Says a Lear∣ned Author in this very Case.</P>
<P>I answer, he either has Sinn'd in Conforming, or he Sinn'd in Dissenting before, or he Sins in coming off; for if he did not Sin in Conforming, he ought to have continued there, and his coming off is a plain Schism; but if he did Sin, he ought to acknowledge the Sin, which is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent.</P>
<P>I am told after all this, but upon what Authority do you write thus? You take upon you to write in the Name of the Dissenters, what Commission have you to write in the Plural? And how do we know that the Dissenters disown this Occasional Commu∣nion.</P>
<P>I answer, Publication is an Appeal to the World; if I have wrote what is not true, or affirm'd that in the Name of the Dissenters which is not their Opi∣nion, I am liable to an easie Confutation; but as I have never yet had my Argument refuted, so tho' I have not received a Formal Commission, Truth is a General Commission, and any Man may write it.</P>
<P>And yet I am not without a general Concurrence of all the Dissenters I ever converst with: and he that can answer the Argument is welcome to Make his Ne∣gative as Publick as this, and let the World judge who is in the Right.</P>

<HEAD>A NEW TEST OF THE Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty: OR, WHIGGISH LOYALTY AND CHURCH LOYALTY COMPAR'D</HEAD>
<P>IN all the unhappy Contentions among Parties and Factions in this brangling Nation, the Champions of the Church of <HI>England, as they wou'd have them∣selves call'd,</HI> have laid it down as the distinguishing Mark of their Hierarchy, that it is her Practice, and has been deriv'd from her very Constitution, as well as Doctrine, to fix in all her Members Principles of unshaken Loyalty to her Prince, entire and undispu∣ted Obedience to all her Commands, and an Abhor∣rence of the very Thoughts of those Hellish Principles, <HI>That it can be lawful on any Account whatsoever to resist the establish'd Power of their Kings.</HI></P>
<P>'Twou'd be endless to quote the the Reverend Dr. <HI>B—ge,</HI> who from the Text in the 13th of <HI>Romans,</HI> v. 1, 2. <HI>Resist not the Powers,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for whatsoever Powers are, he ordained of God; whosoever therefore resisteth the</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="171"/>
<HI>Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God;</HI> tells us, <HI>That if the King shou'd by his Royal Command execute the great∣est Violence upon either our Person or Estate, our Duty was to submit by Prayers and Tears first to God Almighty, to turn the Wrath of his Vicegerent from his Servant, and by bumble Entreaty to beg his Majesties Grace and Pardon; but</HI> to lift up the Hand against the Lord's Anointed, or resist the Evil of punishment he thought fit to inflict <HI>this were a Crime unpardonable either before God or Man, and a Crime, (says the Reverend Dr.) which we bless God the very Principles of our</HI> Ever Loyal Mother, <HI>the Church of</HI> England, <HI>abhors and detests.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let Incendiaries, Phanaticks, and Bloody Peace-break∣ing Wbigs (says another Learned Divine) nourish the Vip'rous Principles of Treason and Rebellion, and let them meet their due Reward of their Factious Doings in the Resentments of a Righteous, but Provok'd Nation: But God be praised, our Mother, the Church of</HI> England, <HI>has always brought up her Sons in an unspotted Loyalty and Obedience; none have been found lifting up their Hands against their Soveraign, or possessing the Rights of the Anointed of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>The very Being and Life, the Original and Principles of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>(says another</HI> 30th <HI>of</HI> January <HI>Sermon) is Loyalty and Fidelity to God, as the Immediate Supream, and to the King as the lively Image of Divine Authority, whose Power is immediately deriv'd from, holds of, and is accountable to none but to God Himself.</HI></P>
<P>To avoid Prolixity of Quotation, the Reader is de∣sired to accept of these as sufficient Proofs of what I lay down <HI>upon this Condition; nevertheless,</HI> that besides the general Appeal which I make to the Memory of most Men, I oblige my self upon Demand to produce Ten Thousand fair Quotations of Non-resistance of Princes, Passive-Obedience, and Divine Authority of the Kingly Power, is own'd and declar'd to be an Essential Part of the Profession and Practice of the
<PB N="175" REF="172"/>
Church of <HI>England;</HI> and upon this Foot, which I hold to be sufficient, I think I cannot be censured if I take it for Granted.</P>
<P>Now as this too much divided Nation has always been compos'd of two contending Parties, those Par∣ties have been distinguish'd, <HI>as in like Cases,</HI> by Names of Contempt; and tho' they have often chang'd them on either side, as Cavalier and Roundhead, Royalists and Rebels, Malignants and Phanaticks, Tories and Whigs, yet the Division has always been barely <HI>the Church and the Dissenter,</HI> and there it continues to this Day.</P>
<P>As the Church of <HI>England</HI> Party have boasted of their own Loyalty, so they have branded the Dissen∣ter with Rebellion and Faction, not only in their Na∣ture, but in their very Principles; they have laid it down in their Writings and Sermons, and Multitudes of their ignorant Hearers believe it, that <HI>the very Doctrine of the Dissenter is made up of Principles in their own Nature tending to Confusion and Rebellion;</HI> they wo'n't be content that we shou'd own there may be Men among all Parties of bad Designs, and who wou'd on all Occasions embroil their Native Country; but it must be woven with the very Articles of Faith; and that 'tis the Religion of a Dissenter to disturb Go∣vernment, kill Kings, and oppose Laws.</P>
<P><HI>The Phanatical Enemies of our King and Church,</HI> says the Learned Dr. <HI>P—n, drink in Rebellion as Water; 'tis the very Substance of their Schismatical Doctrine to o∣verwhelm and destory; and Commonwealths and Confusi∣ons are the Doctrines they preach.</HI></P>
<P>He that lays out one Groat with a Dissenter (says the worthy Sir <HI>Roger</HI> in one of his Famous <HI>Observators)</HI> contributes so much as the Profits of that Groat a∣mounts to in Trade, towards the Subversion of the Monarchy, and Erecting a Common-wealth, for the very Nature and Tendency of their Profession is de∣structive
<PB N="176" REF="173"/>
of Kingly Power, and the Government of the Nation.</P>
<P>This has been the Opinion of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> both of themselves on one Hand, and of the Dis∣senters on the other Hand. I shou'd be glad if I cou'd only say, <HI>It has been,</HI> for we find 'tis still too much their Opinion.</P>
<P>Let no Man say that the Author of these Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation; for if I can make it appear that there is really no Occasion of such unnatural Divisions; and that neither the extraordinary Opinion of themselves, nor the Contempt of their Neighbours, as to the mat∣ter of Loyalty, is a becoming Principle; no, nor a ra∣tional one neither: For that as to Loyalty, Passive-Obedience, Non-Resistance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is really no great Difference between one side or other; I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man; for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both Sides, than to prove that neither Side has any just Cause to contend.</P>
<P>To examine the Matter on both Sides, seems very useful at this time, in order to reconcile Parties, and to settle the Universal Character of the Nation.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>England,</HI> is a limited Monar∣chy, composed of King, Lords, and Commons; each have their several, their separate, and their conjunctive Powers; which acting in Concert, make the Harmo∣ny of the Constitution. I shall not invade the Pro∣vince of those learned Gentlemen, who have underta∣ken to set forth the Branches of the Constitution in all their Powers, Limitations and Prerogatives: 'Tis enough to say the Constitution is known, the Govern∣ment is confin'd by Laws, the Crown limited by Sta∣tutes, and the Peoples Rights confirm'd by the Concessi∣on of Ages.</P>
<P>To this Government, all Distinction of Names set
<PB N="177" REF="174"/>
apart, I am of the Opinion all Parties have in their Turns been equally Loyal; I was going to say, equal∣ly Disloyal: And if I were to use the Language of late Times, it wou'd be a very proper way of speak∣ing.</P>
<P>Affirming without demonstrating is an absurd way of arguing, and therefore it will be needful to come to Particulars, and to examine the several Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has shock'd or clash'd with the People.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis needful co examine the Date of the Difference, and so enter a little into History.</P>
<P>Our first Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. I call it the first, because 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Go∣vernment embrac'd the Protestant Reform'd Religion; this Protestant Religion was establish'd by <HI>that Zea∣lous King,</HI> and by his Parliament, back'd with the force of Laws, and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Autho∣rity it was capable of, and here it began to be call'd the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Some enquiring Christians were for making farther Steps, and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree; and if that good reforming King had liu'd, his Zeal and Integrity was such, that there was no doubt he wou'd have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun, as new Light or more Knowledge had encreased; but the Return of Popery under Queen <HI>Mary</HI> put a Stop to the Work in general, and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> restor'd it again; but as she was a Zealous Protestant Queen, yet she was not for sub∣jecting the Reformation to any Amendment. Not that she believ'd it perfect; but she was a Politick Princess, surrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with; and she was loth to suppose such De∣fects
<PB N="178" REF="175"/>
in the Reformation as were alledg'd, because 'twas to lessen the Reputation of it, and consequently her Interest in the World.</P>
<P>Those who insisted upon the further Reformation were then call'd <HI>Puritans,</HI> because they set up for a greater Purity of Worship; and they separated them∣selves from the establish'd Church, because, as they said, their Consciences inform'd them they cou'd serve God more agreeable to his Will.</P>
<P>I shall not meddle with the Arguments made use of on both Sides, either to defend or expose this Prin∣ciple; 'tis sufficient to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Dissenters: We are now to examine a little further back. Before this Refor∣mation there was no such thing as Church of <HI>England,</HI> it was then the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> that was the esta∣blish'd National Church.</P>
<P>The Protestants under the Titles of <HI>Lollards, Wick∣liffians, Hussites,</HI> &amp;c. what did they do? Did they, <HI>as our Modern People say every Body shou'd,</HI> conform to what the Government commanded? No, the present Church of <HI>England</HI> Party were the Dissenters, the Schismaticks and Phanaticks, in the Days of King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> VIII. were persecuted for not coming to Church, many of them put to Death, and always treated with Scorn and Contempt, as Enemies to the Government, Broachers of new Opinions, and Contemners of Au∣thority, as in the Case of that Famous Proto-Martyr of Christ's Church, <HI>John Lambert,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>In the next Ages these come to have the Power in their Hands, and forgetting that they had found it <HI>Righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man,</HI> they treat those whose Consciences oblige them to dis∣sent from them with the same Contempt which them∣selves had receiv'd from the <HI>Roman</HI> Government.</P>
<P>Thus far they are upon even Terms, as to Obedi∣ence to their Superiors.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="176"/>
The Dissenters have the first Occasion after this to show their Submission under extraordinary Pressures. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> discountenanc'd them continually, and as good a Queen as she was, put some of them to Death. King <HI>James</HI> I. hunted them quite out of the Kingdom, made Thousands of them fly into <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Germa∣ny,</HI> and at last to <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>During the long Reign of these Two Princes we find no charge of Treason or Rebellion upon them; they bore the Displeasure of their Princes with Pati∣ence and Passive Obedience, <HI>if I may be allow'd that Ri∣diculous Phrase;</HI> being persecuted in one City, they fled to another; they bore illegal Prosecutions, and things contrary to their Right, as <HI>English</HI> Men, but never took up Arms against their Prince.</P>
<P>Under the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. the Case alter'd, the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Ci∣vil Right, and Invasion of the Liberty and Properties of the People, the <HI>Puritans</HI> or Dissenters, call them what we please, fell in unanimously with the Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>And here 'tis worthy Remark, that the first Diffe∣rence between the King and the <HI>English</HI> Parliament did not Respect Religion but Civil Property; nor were the Majority of the House <HI>Puritans,</HI> but true Church Protestants, and <HI>English</HI> Men, who stood up∣on the Rights of the People, as <HI>English</HI> Men; and none were more Zealous in the first Disputes than the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Wentworth,</HI> and such as were after∣wards deep Sufferers for the King.</P>
<P>But the Parliament finding the <HI>Puritan</HI> Party stuck close to their Cause, they also came over them when Things came to a Rupture, and so the War begun on the Score of Right, Invasion of Liberty, Breach of the Laws, Private Leagues, and Male-Administration, a Game we have seen play'd over again by the very same Church of <HI>England</HI> that have exclaim'd so much against
<PB N="180" REF="177"/>
it, so damn'd it, and so damn'd themselves, by Oaths, Declarations, Tests, and God knows what against it.</P>
<P>'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loy∣alty, and his former Obedience, and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded. Well, the War ended to his Advantage, he subdued his Soveraign, and brought him to the Block, to the Astonishment of the whole World.</P>
<P>I won't dispute here which or which Party did or did not do it; but to give the Enemy all just Advan∣tage, I am willing to grant it in the largest Sence that the Dissenters, or Phanaticks, or Whigs, call them as you please, did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed, put to Death that Blessed Martyr, King <HI>Charles</HI> the I. whom the Learned Divine, in a Sermon on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> before the Parliament, compares both in the manner of his Sufferings, and the People by whom, to our Saviour and the Jews, and boldly runs on in the Blasphemous Parallel, to shew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King <HI>Charles</HI> ex∣ceed those of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>I think I have granted as largely as a fair Adver∣sary can desire, for I have yielded, for Peace-sake, to several Things which I cou'd fairly disprove.</P>
<P>Nor shall I return to a Repetition of the ill Usage the Dissenters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Account for above 30 Years; the constant Re∣proaches they and their Children after them have met with from those Gentlemen, who on all Occasions have (as I hinted before) particularly taken care to extol their own unshaken Fidelity to their Prince, till at last an Occasion presents to touch them in the same most sensible Part, <HI>their Right and Property;</HI> and <HI>alas!</HI> Their Loyalty, what became of it? Truly the <HI>Faith∣ful, Passively Obedient, Ʋnshakenly Loyal,</HI> Church, re∣turn'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours, and did the same thing exactly which the Whigs, <HI>the Factious Rebellious Whigs,</HI> had done before.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="178"/>
<HI>No, that's false,</HI> (says a Disciple of Dr. <HI>Sherlock</HI>'s) <HI>we did not Kill our King, we did not dip our Hands in Royal Blood, nor hurt the Lords Anointed.</HI></P>
<P>No, that's true, but the Lords Anointed may thank himself for that; for my part I think the Difference only lyes here; the Whigs in 41, to 48, took up Arms against their King, and having Conquer'd him, and ta∣ken him Prisoner, and having taken him Prisoner, cut off his Head, <HI>because they had begun:</HI> The Church of <HI>England</HI> took Arms against their King in 88, and did not cut off his Head, <HI>because they had him not.</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> lost his Life, <HI>because he did not run away;</HI> and his Son, King <HI>James,</HI> sav'd his Life, <HI>because he did run away.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis such a Jest, such a Banter, to say, We did take up Arms, but we did not kill him: <HI>Bless us, Kill our King, we wou'd not have hurt a Hair of his Head!</HI> Why, every Bullet shot at the Battel of the <HI>Boyne</HI> was a kil∣ling the King; for if you did not, 'twas because you cou'd not hit him.</P>
<P>If a Highway-man Fires at you upon the Road, when he is taken, and brought upon his Trial, our Learned Recorder, before he pronounces Sentence of Death, Harangues him in this manner: <HI>And besides all this, Sir, you are plainly guilty of Murther; for you not only assaulted this Honest Man in order to take away his Money, but you endeavoured to Murther him; for you shot at him in order to kill him; and the Intention of Murther is equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it self.</HI></P>
<P>Now who did we shoot at at the <HI>Boyne? 'Tis true, King</HI> James <HI>generally stood out of the way:</HI> But who did we Shoot at? What! Was our Orders to <HI>fight against both small and great, and not against the King of</HI> Israel? Had your Bullets Commission to shew their Loyalty, and not to touch the Lords Anointed? If he had charg'd in the first Squadrons of his Horse
<PB N="182" REF="179"/>
had you not kill'd him if you cou'd? I think this needs no further Proof.</P>
<P>Nay, if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both sides, the Whigs have been the ho∣nester of the two, for they never profest any such blind, absolute and undisputed Obedience to Princes, as the others have done.</P>
<P>It has always been their Opinion, That Govern∣ment was Originally contrived by the Consent, and for the mutual Benefit of the Parties Govern'd, that the People have an Original Native Right to their Property, the Liberty of their Persons and Possessi∣ons, <HI>unless forefaulted to the Laws;</HI> that they cannot be divested of their Right but by their own Consent; and that all Invasion of this Right is destructive of the Constitution, and dissolves the Compact of Govern∣ment and Obedience.</P>
<P>They have always declar'd, That they understand their Allegiance to their Governors to be, <HI>supposing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land;</HI> and that if Princes break this Bond of Government, the Nature of it is inverted, and the Constitution ceases of course.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> in <HI>Scotland, Algernoon Sidney</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> have set their Names, and the latter his Blood, to this Doctrine; and the Author of the <HI>True-born Englishman</HI> is worth quoting in this Case.<Q><L>The Government's ungirt when Justice dies,</L>

<P>This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Dissen∣ters, and is indeed the true Sense of the Constitution it self; pursuant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppose Violence with Force; believ∣ing that when Kings break Coronation Oaths, the Solemn Compact with their People, and encroach up∣on their Civil Rights, contrary to the Laws of the Land, by which they are Sworn to Rule, they cease to be the Lord's Anointed any longer; the Sanction of their Office is vanish'd, and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Mankind, and may be treated accordingly.</P>
<P>Now 'tis no wonder to find People of these Prin∣ciples vigorously withstanding their Governors when they tread upon the tender sore Places of the Consti∣tution, 'tis nothing but what they all along pretended to, and declar'd to be their Opinion.</P>
<P>But to find the Church of <HI>England-</HI>Men, whose Loyalty has been the Subject of a thousand Learned Authors, and numberless Sermons, whose Character and Mark of Distinction has been chosen more for her steady Adherence and Fidelity to her Prince than to God Almighty, whose Obedience to her Monarch has been declar'd to be Inviolate and Immovable, and who pretends to be Famous through the whole World for her Faithfulness to Kings, <HI>for her,</HI> as soon as ever the King did but, as it were, seem to aim at crushing her Authority, as soon as he did but begin to call her Clergy to an Account, and clap her <HI>Golden Condlesticks</HI> for Disobedience, <HI>for her</HI> to winch and kick

<P>Where's the Worthy Dr. <HI>B—ge</HI>'s Loyal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> now, his Immovable Loyalty? That after all his Ab∣solute Submission, is so far from being a Martyr to his own Doctrine, that he could not lose a small Benefice for it?</P>
<P>Where is the famous Dr. <HI>S—k?</HI> Who having stood out long in his old Antiquated Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and confirm'd the Faith of his Suff'ring Brethren, by strong and wonderful Argu∣ments, at last, at the powerful Instigation of a Wife, and a good Salary, <HI>has Sold all his Loyalty for a Mess of Pottage,</HI> solving his Honesty with the wretched Distinction of a Power <HI>De Facto,</HI> and a Power <HI>De Jure;</HI> as if the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Credit cou'd be sav'd by such an impotent Shift, or as if he cou'd make Amends to the Prebendary for his helping him to Sacriflce his Brethren, to Father his Conversion on reading honest Dr. <HI>Overall,</HI> whose Doctrine, 'tis well known, the Doctor knew before; but that he was loth Dr. <HI>South</HI> shou'd have the Honour of bringing him over to such Old Phanatick Principles?</P>
<P>Behold the Loyalty of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> now let's examine their Conscience, as to taking Oaths; and if I do not bring them to be all Whigs, and <HI>For∣ty-One-Men,</HI> or else prove them all Perjur'd, then I do nothing.</P>
<P>The Clergy, all the Magistrates and Officers of the Houshold, of the Civil or Military Government, were Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> otherwise they cou'd not be employ'd; the Sacramental Test has done the Dissenters this Kindness, that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the Kingdom were Disciples of the Church; and as an additional Circumstance, the Oath of Allegiance which they took, and which
<PB N="185" REF="182"/>
was (God be praised) of their own making, bound them to that same Absolute Blind Obedience which they profest, and confin'd it to the King, his Heirs and Successors.</P>
<P>If this Oath be consider'd literally, I am content to be silenc'd when one fair Argument can be brought to evade it; the Declaration follow'd it, wherein they detest and abhor that devilish Doctrine, that 'tis law∣ful <HI>on any Pretence whatsoever, (Mark the Emphasis)</HI> to take up Arms against the King; this <HI>(equal to an Oath)</HI> declar'd in the Presence of God, and the Particulars being material to our Purpose, are as follows:
<Q>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do Declare and Believe that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever to take up Arms against the King, and that I do abhor that Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against those that are com∣missioned by him.<P>So help me God.</P></Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, you have taken up Arms a∣gainst, deposed, and as far as you were able, put to Death your lawful King, the very King you swore Al∣legiance to.</P>
<P>Now <HI>pray Gentlemen give Commission to some worthy Champion of your Church's Loyalty to bring you sairly off of your Oath and Declaration if you can;</HI> and till you do, be not angry with us for making one of these Con∣clusions from the Premises, and you shall chuse for your selves.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That this Doctrine of Absolute, Passive and Non-resistant Obedience, is an Absurdity in it self, contradictory to the Nature of Government and Al∣legiance, and politically introduc'd by State Engines into the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to abuse her, and betray her Members into unforeseen Mischiefs and Inconve∣niences.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="183"/>
Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are all Apostates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church, Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man, Notorious Hypocrites, and Decei∣vers; who having sworn Obedience without Reserve to their Prince, are become Traitors, Rebels, and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed, and their Law∣ful Soveraign; and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, have depos'd and traiterously dethron'd their Rightful King, God Almighty's Vicegerent, ac∣countable to no Earthly Power, Supream under God, Absolute, and, from Divine Institution, Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country.</P>
<P>Or, <HI>Lastly,</HI> That they only are the true Church of <HI>England,</HI> who according to their avow'd Profession, have firmly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude, have never blacken'd their Consciences, nor gone back from their Obedience, forgotten their Oaths, nor sullied their Reputation with the horrid Crimes of Treason and Rebellion, as they think it to be.</P>
<P>Now, as a fair Disputant, I am willing the Respon∣dent shall chuse which of these three Consequences he will stand by in Behalf of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s Loyalty; but if they wou'd take the Advice of <HI>a Friend to the Honest Part of them,</HI> I wou'd recommend the first Conclusion to be fittest for them for the fol∣lowing Reasons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because since Humane Infallibility is <HI>(and with good Reason)</HI> disown'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both for her self and every Body else, it can be no Dimi∣nution to her Reputation, when she has found her self mistaken, and impos'd upon, to acknowledge her Er∣ror; <HI>a wise Man will always own, rather than defend a Mistake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up against any other Pretence, Evasion, or
<PB N="187" REF="184"/>
Reservation, and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can say for them, and must remain so, till I find something else said that is more to the Purpose.</P>
<P>But the Mischief of all is, that if this be honestly acknowledg'd <HI>(as is doubtless most true)</HI> that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was mistaken, and impos'd upon, to espouse a Sensless Absurd Principle, contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> why then they come over to this Consequence;</P>
<P>That Government and Allegiance are both Condi∣tional, and Oaths of Subjects are always to be consi∣der'd in a Constructive Sence, with Conditions of Pro∣tection, and the like; a thing which is without question the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance; other∣wise Subjects may be put under an Absolute Necessity of Perjury, or State Martyrdom, by often Swearing what may be impossible for them to perform.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Aeth</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> has been about Six Times, and the Town of <HI>Rhinebergh</HI> in <HI>Gueldre</HI> about Twelve Times, Taken and Retaken; and as often as new Masters had Possession of the Place, so often the poor Inhabitants have sworn to their new Lords: What can the Meaning of such an Oath be, but that they will be faithful to them so long as they keep Pos∣session of the Place? 'Twou'd be ridiculous to imagine the Imposers of the Oath requir'd any more.</P>
<P>If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contra∣ry to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance, let them answer for it who first made it, then took it, then broke it: But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Suggestion that I know of.</P>
<P>Till then some further Argument is produc'd, it must rest here, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> was Mi∣staken, Imposed upon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that she finds when the Laws are Broken, the Right of the People Invaded, the Root of the Government Struck at, Church and State Undermin'd, and Despotick Tyranny at the
<PB N="188" REF="185"/>
Door, the Native Right of the People is Superior, and they may assume a Power to Right themselves.</P>
<P><HI>And so we are brought back to Whiggism and Forty. One; and Gentlemen, there is no Remedy for it, help it if ye can.</HI></P>
<P>Where now is the Difference between Church Loy∣alty, and Whiggish Loyalty, Roundhead or Cavalier, Churchman or Dissenter, Whig or Troy? All are alike; they are pleas'd, when legally Govern'd, Quar∣relsome and Unruly, if Opprest; and will Defend themselves, if Assaulted, tho' it be by their Kings, or any Body else.</P>
<P>Why then is the Difference kept up? Methinks they might all be Friends together, for they are all alike; the Dissenters have been in their times as Loyal, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> in their time as Disloyal, one as another. <HI>Vice versa;</HI> the Dissenters have been as Disloyal, and the Churchmen as Loyal, as one another upon the same Occasion; they have been both Suf∣ferers, and have submitted to the Government; ay, and to the Oppressions and Persecutions of their Su∣periors and Soveraigns; and again, upon the like Oc∣casions, they have both of them been Rebels. <HI>if their own Language may be so far used;</HI> they have both of them, in their Turn, taken Arms against, and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings.</P>
<P>So that in my Opinion, <HI>with a Latitude to all that think otherwise, to think as they please,</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and their Neighbours the Dissenters, have nothing to quarrel with one another about, as to Loy∣alty; as to other Matters I have nothing to say to them, nor shall not mingle it with this Discourse.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr against the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor is it at all intended to be so; and to stop all Pretences that way, I take the Free∣dom to say, here has been no Crime, the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been in the right of it; not in taking Arms, but the Error was in Espousing, Crying up, and
<PB N="189" REF="186"/>
Pretending to a Blind Absolute Obedience to Princes, be their Commands never so Absolute, Tyrannical or Illegal; this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> nor of any Church or People in the Christian World, ever pretended to; and there∣fore the Fanlt lay in those People, who being them∣selves Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> suffer'd themselves to be deluded by State Ministers, to foster a Tenent upon the Church, which her Original Con∣stitution never pretended to, and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The first beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in <HI>Manwaring</HI>'s and <HI>Sibthorp</HI>'s Libels, in the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. cajoling the King; and then to please him, endeavouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Govern∣ment; and affirming, that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Administration of the Government.</P>
<P>Upon this preposterons Foundation they built the Illegitimate Structure of Absolute Undisputed Obedi∣ence; for if Kingly Power were once prov'd to be im∣mediately deriv'd from Divine Authority, Absolute Obedience wou'd be a Consequence no Body cou'd dispute, since the same Obedience without Reserve wou'd be due to the Delegated Power, as to the Power Delegating.</P>
<P>And tho' this is a Point easily enough confuted, yet being willing to keep the present Dispute within as small a Compass we can, I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it.</P>
<P>Whether Government be of Divine Original or not, seems not the Question here; for if it be not so, then, as before, the Church of <HI>England</HI> have been Mistaken, and Imposed upon; and if it be so, then the Church of <HI>England</HI> has trampled under Foot their own Doctrine, turn'd Rebels to God, and Apostates from the Faith they have profest, have Sacrilegiously and Traiterously
<PB N="190" REF="187"/>
taken up Arms against their Prince, assaulted the Lords Anointed, <HI>resisted the Powers, which are the Ordi∣nance of God,</HI> deposed their Lawful Soveraign, broken their Allegiance, and consequently <HI>are a Parcel of Per∣jur'd Rebels;</HI> every Jot as bad as the worst Roundhead Regicide, and Rebel of the Year Forty-One.</P>
<P>What more or less can be said I profess I know not, and am in great Expectation of something new in the Matter; for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with, any thing to contradict it.</P>
<P>The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circumstances of mutual Compact between King and People, seems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles; the Na∣ture of Government has made it the necessary Conse∣quence of all Argument relating to Power; and I cou'd give Instances in all the Nations in the World, that some time or other, even the Right of Succession to Government, <HI>which must be as Sacred as the Power,</HI> has been Interrupted and Limited by the People, in case of Tyranny and Illegal Governing; and every Nati∣on, <HI>and this among the rest,</HI> has oftentimes Depos'd their Princes for the Preservation of the State, when either Incapacity for Government, Tyrannical Usur∣pation, or other Male-Administration, has been the Case.</P>
<P>But this I think also needless here; every one that is vers'd in History can read the numerous Examples in the <HI>Roman, Grecian</HI> and <HI>Persian</HI> Histories, <HI>even Sacred Histories, where Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where,</HI> are full of them; the Histories of <HI>Spain, Portugal, France, Lombardy,</HI> the Empires of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> and <HI>Muscovy,</HI> even the Papal Chair, have suffer'd Convulsions and Revolutions, the Deposing and Dis∣placing their Soveraigns, when the Peoples Good, <HI>which is, and ever was, the Soul, the Center, the End, and the Cause of all Government,</HI> came to be in the Dispute.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="188"/>
But to return to the Principles of the Two Parties we are now discoursing of; the Whigs, as before, have always asserted this to be their Notion of Government and Governors; and the Church of <HI>England, however some among them have topt an empty Notion upon them,</HI> have all along, and <HI>now at last once for all,</HI> own'd it by their Practice.<Q><L>That Kings when they descend to Tyranny,</L>
<L>Dissolve the Bond, and leave the Subject free.</L>
<BIBL>True-born Eng. Man, <HI>P.</HI> 47.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The Act for the further Limitation of the Crown past in the last Parliament, and the Right of the People therein Declar'd and Recogniz'd, I wou'd ask my Op∣ponent whose Act and Deed it was? Will they say it was a Whiggish Act, made by a Phanatical House of Commons? <HI>I dare say there was not Ten Dissenters in the House;</HI> let them descend with us into Particulars, let them draw out a <HI>Black List</HI> of Members, who in that Loyal Honest <HI>English</HI> Parliament gave their Hands to the last Settlement and Declaration of Right, and let us <HI>tell Noses,</HI> and put a Brand upon the <HI>Phanaticks</HI> a∣mong them.</P>
<P>Will they tell us it was a <HI>Phanatical Parliament</HI> that set the Crown upon the Queens Head? I hope they will own Her Majesty, and their Lordships the Bishops, are part of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> for if the Head and the principal Members are not, we know not who are.</P>
<P>Will they tell us that Sir <HI>E. S.</HI> Sir <HI>B. S.</HI> Sir <HI>J. B.</HI> Mr, <HI>H—y,</HI> Sir <HI>C—r M—ve,</HI> and a Hundred more of that Side, were Whigs and Common∣wealth-Men?</P>
<P>How comes it to pass in <HI>England,</HI> that no <HI>Papist</HI> can inherit? <HI>Divine Right</HI> ought to supercede all Precau∣tions, and <HI>the Young Prince of</HI> Savoy, not the <HI>House of Hannover</HI> ought to Reign with a <HI>Non Obstante</HI> to all
<PB N="192" REF="189"/>
Humane Limitation, if all was from Heaven? Where are our Right Line-Men now! Why, truly the Rea∣son is plain, the <HI>Church of England, People of England, a Church of England, Parliament of England,</HI> have thought fit to Declare, that for the Good of the People <HI>to which all Right of Succession to Power must give way, because from them all Power it self does derive,</HI> and by the Voice of that people (in which Authority sufficient is Legally Grounded) it is Unanimously agreed, that <HI>we will not have a Papist to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>All this is too plain to admit of a Dispute; and now to me it seems Preposterous why any Men shou'd keep up the Distinction between Parties as to Loyalty, when indeed there is no manner of Difference in the Case.</P>
<P>I have talk'd several times of Bearing, Suffering, being Persecuted and Oppress'd, as the Dissenters in their time have been more than enough, and again in their Turn the Church of <HI>England</HI> have been Per∣secuted too; for as I noted before, they were once the <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> the <HI>Whigs,</HI> and the <HI>Dissenters.</HI> Now I think 'tis not very foreign to my Argument to exa∣mine whether of the Two behav'd themselves under their Sufferings with the greatest Submission, who show'd most Absolute Obedience to their Superiors, and who <HI>first, or oftenest, rebell'd</HI> against their Lawful Soveraign.</P>
<P>The Protestants under <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. were the first Dissenters; they were kept Under, Persecuted, and put to Death as Rebels and Schismaticks. Now up∣on due Search it will be fouhd, that under the Pro∣tection of Two Protestant Queens, Wives of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. they had more than once form'd such In∣terest at Court, and in the Kingdom, as to begin to be formidable to the Popish Powers then reigning; and the Fall of the Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> was thought a ne∣cessary Policy in King <HI>Henry,</HI> to prevent the Plots of the <HI>Phanatical Church of</HI> England <HI>Hereticks;</HI> a long Ac∣count
<PB N="193" REF="190"/>
of which may be read in the Life of that Prince.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. a Zealous and pious Prince, made no Scruple for the <HI>Propagation</HI> of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> of which he was the Glorious Founder, to set Aside the Lawful and Undisputed Suc∣cession of his own Sisters, to Establish the Crown in the Lady <HI>Jane Grey,</HI> who he knew wou'd carry on the Work of Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>There's an Instance of the Zeal for Succession in the Right Line in the First Protestant Head that ever the Church of</HI> England <HI>had.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Gospellers, <HI>that is, the Church of</HI> England <HI>Protestants of</HI> Suffolk, having some Sense of Injury done to the <HI>Princess Mary,</HI> and willing to have the Succession go on in the Right Line, provided they cou'd both preserve their Religion and Loyalty too; Capitulate with her, and promise to stand by her, pro∣vided she wou'd promise to preserve, and make no Alteration, in their Establish'd Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men own'd the Liber∣ty of their Religion to be Superior to their Loyalty to her; and that they had a Right to Submit, or not to Submit, as their Liberty was, or was not, Secure: and accordingly Condition'd with her before they wou'd Acknowledge her to be their Queen.</P>
<P>And we see how Heaven punish'd them for venturing on the Word of a <HI>Prince</HI> when their Religion and Li∣berty was at Stake.</P>
<P>In this Queen's Time the Church having been again Suppress'd, and Popery Erected, Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat,</HI> an honest Church of <HI>England</HI> Protestant, with a very good Body of Men, took up Arms against their Lawful Princess for breaking her Word, in Defence of their <HI>Dear Religion Establish'd by Blessed King</HI> Edward, which were the very Words of the Manifesto they Publish'd: The Londoners, with 800 Men sent by the Queen a∣gainst
<PB N="194" REF="191"/>
gainst them, thought it no Treachery to Desert their Lawful Popish Queen, and go over to their Protestant Church of <HI>England</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P>We have nothing to do with the Justification of this Fact, 'tis sufficient that so it was, and that these were Protestants of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the first and purest part of their Principles, and let them justifie the Fact if they please.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Succeeds, and then the Church of <HI>England</HI> shone in its Meridian Glory; and then grew up some, who aiming, <HI>as I said before,</HI> at a further Reformation, and the Church refusing to hearken to it, form'd a new Party of Dissenters, and these were call'd <HI>Puritans,</HI> and since that <HI>Phanaticks.</HI></P>
<P>Now I Challenge the Defender of this Cause to tell me one Disloyal Act, one Plot against the Govern∣ment, one Disturbance of the Civil Peace, among these Dissenters, from the beginning of this Queen, which was their own beginning, to the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. which was a continued Term of 80 Years; and yet, during this time, they suffer'd all manner of Indignities, Reproaches, Fining, Impri∣sonings, Banishment, Confiscations, and Corporal Punishments.</P>
<P>So that hitherto the Passive Obedience of the Dis∣senters hath far exceeded that of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> These had but Five Years Oppression under Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and in that Five Years they once Capi∣tulated with their Soveraign to make her Queen upon Conditions, and once took Arms against her after she was Queen; and <HI>by that</HI> I must always understand, that if they did not Depose and Destroy her, it was because they cou'd not; <HI>and if they had done it, no doubt they had Cause sufficient to Justifie them before God and Man.</HI> The <HI>Puritans</HI> after this suffered all that their <HI>too cruel Brethren</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> laid upon them during Three tedious Reigns, before
<PB N="195" REF="192"/>
they so much as made the least offer at doing them∣selves Justice; and for 80 Years together exercis'd that <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> which they never pretended to.</P>
<P>At last they took Arms, and when they did, they did it to purpose, carried all before them, subdued Monar∣chy, cut off their Kings Head, and <HI>all that.</HI></P>
<P>After the Restoration Things began to return to their old Channel, and 30 Years more the Dissenters endur'd another <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Servitude, were <HI>Persecu∣ted, Plunder'd, Indicted, Imprison'd, Plagu'd</HI> with Im∣positions, Stigmatiz'd with a Thousand Reproaches, their Meeting-Houses Demolish'd, their Estates Con∣fiscated, their Persons Excommunicated, and Anathe∣matiz'd, Sworn into <HI>Plots</HI> they never Heard of, and in∣to Crimes they never Commltted, Dragg'd to Goals, Gibbets and Scaffolds, and the like; <HI>all this while Passive-Obedence, if there were any such thing,</HI> was found among them more than any where else; for here was no Rebellion, no Insurrection, nor breaking of the <HI>Peace</HI> by the Dissenters, notwithstanding all those Op∣positions.</P>
<P>After this comes King <HI>James</HI> the Second to the Crown, and he turn'd the Scale, and, together with Invasion of Liberty, falls upon the Church, begins to Rifle her of her Trophies, <HI>for no Essentials had been touch'd,</HI> and how long did she bear it? Not 80 Years, not 30 Years, no, not so many Months.</P>
<P>What did she do? Truly nothing but what she ought to have done; Defend her Liberty and Religi∣on by Force, against Unjust Invasion and Tyranny: nothing but what all the Nations in the World have done, and wou'd do again if they cou'd.</P>
<P>The only Error we Charge upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was setting up pretences of what they really wou'd not practice; crying up themselves for Fools, when we knew they were Wiser Men, calling them∣selves
<PB N="196" REF="193"/>
humble Slaves, but when the Trial came, pro∣ving Stubborn, Refractory, <HI>Liberty Mongers,</HI> even as bad as the worst Whig or Phanatick of them all.</P>
<P>For the future then, if a Humble Mediator might be permitted to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> it shou'd be in these short and friendly Terms.</P>
<P>Pray Gentlemen never be Imposed upon, to pre∣tend to more Loyalty, and more slavish Principles than you intend to practice.</P>
<P>Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sove∣reign requires. Our Late King, who I am not asham'd to show as a Pattern for future Ages, requir'd; and Her present Majesty, <HI>without Affront to Her Majesty's Authority it may be said,</HI> requires no further Obedi∣ence from the People of <HI>England</HI> than the Laws of <HI>England</HI> require.</P>
<P>To Govern according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the People; and to obey according to Law, is a full Satisfaction to the Soveraign. The Laws are the Test both of the Royal Authority, and of the Subjects Obedience; and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires, is abusing your Prince, and abu∣sing your Selves.</P>
<P>Never be ashamed to own, with <HI>your Brethren the Whigs,</HI> that you are willing to Submit to Authority but that you expect to be govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm,</P>
<P>Let the Scoth Motto be set upon your Liberties; and according to your constant Practice, <HI>as well as theirs;</HI> let all Men know you design to make it Good, <HI>Nemo me Impune Lacessit.</HI></P>
<P>And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of <HI>England, nor were a Hundredth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it;</HI> so for the Fu∣ture 'tis hoped you will not suffer such to Mingle themselves among you, or to Act in the Name of
<PB N="197" REF="194"/>
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who pretend to a Blind Ab∣solute Obedience to Princes.</P>
<P>And <HI>Lastly,</HI> Gentlemen, a little more Modesty to your Humble Servants, your Protestant Brethren the Dissenters, or Whigs, I mean as to Matter of Loyalty: For in Truth, Gentlemen, we do not see any Reason you have to Reproach us in that Matter, you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours.</P>

<P><HI>No, Gentlemen,</HI> the Time of Mercy is past, your <HI>Day of Grace is over;</HI> you shou'd have practic'd Peace, and Moderation, and Charity, if you expected any your selves.</P>
<P>We have heard none of this Lesson for Fourteen Years past: We have been huff'd and bully'd with
<PB N="199" REF="196"/>
your Act of Toleration; you have told us that you are the <HI>Church establish'd by Law,</HI> as well as others; have set up your <HI>Canting-Synagogues</HI> at our Church-Doors, and the Church and Members have been load∣ed with Reproaches, with Oaths, Associations, Abju∣rations, and what not; where has been the Mercy, the forbearance, the Charity, you have shewn to <HI>ten∣der Consciences of the Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that cou'd not take Oaths <HI>as fast you made 'em;</HI> that having sworn Allegiance to their lawful and rightful King, cou'd not dlspence with that Oath, <HI>their King being still alive,</HI> and swear to your new <HI>Hodge-podge of a Dutch Govern∣ment?</HI> These ha' been turn'd out of their Livings, and they and their Families left to starve; their Estates double Tax'd, to carry on a War they had <HI>no Hand in,</HI> and you <HI>got nothing by:</HI> What Account can you give of the Multitudes you have forc'd to comply, against their Consciences, with your new <HI>sophistical Politicks,</HI> who like new Converts in <HI>France,</HI> Sin because they can't Starve. And now the Tables are turn'd upon you, you <HI>must not be Persecuted, 'tis not a Christian Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>You have <HI>Butcher'd</HI> one King <HI>Depos'd</HI> another King, and made a <HI>mock King</HI> of a Third; and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and trusted by the Fourth; any Body that did not know the Temper of your Party, wou'd stand amaz'd at the Impudence, as well as Fully, to think of it.</P>
<P>Your Management of your <HI>Dutch Monarch,</HI> whom you reduc'd to a meer <HI>King of Cl—s,</HI> is enough to give any future Princes such an Idea of your Principles, as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your Clutches; and God be thank'd, the Queen is out of your Hands, knows you, and will have a care of you.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but the supream Authority of a Nation has in its self a <HI>Power, and a Right to that Pow∣er,</HI> to execute the Laws upon any part of that Nation it governs. The execution of the known Laws of the
<PB N="200" REF="197"/>
Land, and that with a weak and gentle Hand neither was all this phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Persecution; this they have magnified to a Height, that the Sufferings of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France</HI> were not to be compar'd with—Now to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon those who trans∣gress them, after voluntarily consenting to the mak∣ing those Laws, can never be call'd Persecution, but Justice. But Justice is always Violence to the Party offending, for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes. The first execution of the Laws against Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> was in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> the First; and what did it amount to, truly, the worst they suf∣fer'd, was at their own request, to let them go to <HI>New-England,</HI> and erect a new Collony, and give them great Priviledges, Grants, and suitable Powers, keep them under Protection, and defend them against all Invaders, and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them. This was the cruelty of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> fatal Lenity! 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince, King <HI>Charles</HI> the First. Had King <HI>James</HI> sent all the Puri∣tans in <HI>England</HI> away to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> we had been a national, unmix'd, Church; the Church of <HI>England</HI> had been kept undivided and entire.</P>
<P>To requite the Lenity of the Father, they take up Arms against the Son; Conquer, Pursue, Take, Im∣prison, and at last put to Death, the Anointed of God, and Destroy the very Being and Nature of Govern∣ment, setting up a fordid Impostor, who had neither Title to Govern, nor Understanding to Manage, but supplied that want with Power, bloody and desperate Councils and Craft, without Conscience.</P>
<P>Had not King <HI>James</HI> the First withheld the full ex∣ecution of the Laws; had he given them strict Justice he had clear'd the Nation of them, and the Consequen∣ces had been plain; his <HI>Son had never been Murther'd by them,</HI> nor the Monarchy overwhelm'd; 'twas <HI>too</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="198"/>
<HI>much Mercy</HI> shewn them was the ruin of his Posterity, and the ruin of the Nations Peace. One would think the Dissenters should not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Tolera∣tion, when they know that they have once requited us with a civil War, and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Persecution for our former Civility.</P>
<P>Nay to encourage us to be easie with them, 'tls ap∣parent that they never had the Upper-hand of the Church, but they treated Her with all the Severity; with all the Reproach and Contempt as was possible: What Peace, and what Mercy did they shew the Loy∣al Gentry of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the Time of their Triumphant Commonwealth? How did they put all the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> to Ransom, whether they were Actually in Arms for the King or not, ma∣king People compound for their Estates, and starve their Families? How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> sequester'd the Ministers, de∣vour'd the Patrimony of the Church, and divided the Spoil, by sharing the Church-Lands among their Sol∣diers, and turning her Clergy out to starve? just such Measure as they have meted, shou'd be measur'd them again.</P>
<P>Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and 'tis plain She has put it in Practice towards the Dissenters, even beyond what they ought, till She has been wanting to Her Self, and in effect, unkind to own Sons; particularly, in the too much Lenity of King <HI>James</HI> the First, mention∣ed before; had he so Rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land, which he had an Opportunity early to ha' done, they had not had the Power to vex the Church, as since they have done.</P>
<P>IN the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, how did the Church reward their Bloody Doings with Lenity and Mercy, <HI>except the Barbarous Regicides of the preten∣ded</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="199"/>
<HI>Court of Justice:</HI> not a Soul suffer'd for all the Blood in an Unnatural War: King <HI>Charles</HI> came in all Mercy and Love, cherish'd them, prefer'd them, employ'd them, withheld the Rigour of the Law, and oftentimes, even against the Advice of his Par∣liament, gave them Liberty of Conscience; and how did they requite him wich the villainous Contrivance to Depose and Murther him and his Successor at the <HI>Rye-Plot.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>James,</HI> as if Mercy was the inherent Quality of the Family, began his Reign with unusual Favour to them: Nor could their joining with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> against him move him to do himself Ju∣stice upon them; but that mistaken Prince thought to win them by Gentleness and Love, Poclaim'd an Uni∣versal Liberty to them, and rather discountenanc'd the Church of <HI>England</HI> than them; how they requited him all the World knows.</P>
<P>THE late Reign is too fresh in the Memory of all the World to need a Comment; how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redressing some Grie∣vances, they pusht Things to that Extremity, in Con∣junction wirh some mistaken Gentlemen, as to De∣pose the late King, as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not have been redress'd but by the absolute Ruin of the Prince: Here's an instance of their Temper, their Peace, and Charity. To what height they car∣ried themselves during the Reign of a King of their own; how they crope into all Places of Trust and Profit; how they Insinuated into the Favour of the King, and were at first prefer'd to the highest Places in the Nation; how they engross'd the Ministry, and <HI>above all, how pitifully they Manag'd,</HI> is too plain to need any Remarks.</P>
<P>BUT particularly their Mercy and Charity, the Spirit of Union, they tell us so much of, has been re∣markable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if any Man wou'd see the Spirit
<PB N="203" REF="200"/>
of a Dissenter, let him look into <HI>Scotland:</HI> there they made entire Conquest of the Church, trampled down the Sacred Orders, and supprest the Episcopal Go∣vernment, with an absolute, and as they suppose ir∣retrievable Victory, tho' 'tis possible, <HI>they may find themselves Mistaken:</HI> Now 'twou'd be a very proper Question to ask their <HI>Impudent Advocate, the Observa∣tor,</HI> Pray how much Mercy and Favour did the Mem∣bers of the Episcopal Church find in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the <HI>Scotch</HI> Presbyterian Government; and I shall un∣dertake for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Dissenters shall still receive as much here, tho' they deserve but little.</P>
<P>In a small Treatise of the Sufferings of the Episco∣pal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'twill appear what Usage they met with, how they not only lost their Living, but in several Places, were plunder'd and abus'd in their Per∣sons; the Ministers that cou'd not Conform, turn'd out with numerous Families, and no Maintenance, and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of Bread; and the Cruelties of the Parties are innu∣merable, and not to be attempted in this short Piece.</P>
<P>And now to prevent the distant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from <HI>England;</HI> with a true <HI>Presbyterian Policy,</HI> they put in for <HI>a Ʋnion of Nations,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> might unite their Church with the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Presbyterian Mem∣bers sit in our House of Commons, and their Assem∣bly of <HI>Scotch</HI> canting Long Cloaks in our Convocati∣on, what might have been if our Phanatick, Whiggish States-men continu'd, God only knows, but we hope we are out of fear of that now.</P>
<P>'Tis alled'd by some of the Faction, and they began to Bully us with it; that if we won't Unite with them, they will not settle the Crown with us again, but when Her Majesty Dies, will chuse a King for them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="201"/>
If they won't, we must make them, and 'tis not the first time we have let them know that we are able. The Crowns of these Kingdoms have not so far dis∣owned the Right of Succession, but they may retrieve it again, and if <HI>Scotland</HI> thinks to come off from a Suc∣cessive to an Elective State of Government, <HI>England</HI> has not promised not to assist the Right Heir, and put them into Possession, without any regard to their ri∣diculous Settlements.</P>
<P>THESE are the Gentlemen, these their ways of treating the Church, both at home and abroad. Now let us examine the Reasons they pretend to give, why we shou'd be favourable to them, why we should con∣tinue and tolerate them among us.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THEY are very Numerous, they say, They are a great Part of the Nation, and we cannot Suppress them.</P>
<P>To this may be answer'd, 1. THEY are not so Numerous as the Protestants in <HI>France,</HI> and yet the <HI>French</HI> King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once, and we don't find he Misses them at Home.</P>
<P>But I am not of the Opinion they are so Numerous as is pretended, their Party is more Numerous than their Persons, and those mistaken People of the Church who are misled and deluded by their wheedling Ar∣tifices, to join with them, make their Party the great∣ter; but those will open their Eyes, when the Govern∣ment shall set heartily about the Work, and come off from them, as some Animals, which they say, always desert a House when 'tis likely to fall.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> The more Numerous, the more Dangerous and therefore the more Need to Suppress them; and God has suffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our Sides, for not utterly extinguishing them long ago.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> If we are to allow them, only because we
<PB N="205" REF="202"/>
cannot Suppress them, then it ought to be try'd whe∣ther we can or no; and I am of Opinion 'tis easie to be done, and cou'd prescribe Ways and Means, if it were proper, but I doubt not the Government will find effectual Methods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument they use, which is this, That 'tis a Time of War, and we have need to Unite against the common Enemy.</P>
<P>WE answer, This common Enemy had been no E∣nemy, if they had not made him so; he was quiet, in peace, and no way disturb'd, or encroach'd upon us, and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him.</P>
<P>But further, We make no question but we are able to deal with this common Enemy without their help; but why must we unite with them, because of the E∣nemy? Will they go over to the Enemy, if we do not prevent it by a Union with them?—We are ve∣ry well contented they shou'd, and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and the common Enemy too, and better without them than with them.</P>
<P>Besides, if we have a common Enemy, there is the more need to be secure against our private Enemies; if there is one common Enemy, we have the less need to have an Enemy in our Bowels.</P>
<P>'Twas a great Argument some People used against Suppressing the Old Money, that 'twas a Time of War, and 'twas too great a Risque for the Nation to run, if we shou'd not master it, we shou'd be undone: and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not so great, but it might be master'd, and the Success was answer∣able. The Suppressing the Dissenters is not a harder Work, nor a Work of less Necessity to the Publick: we can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whig∣gisme, Faction, and Schism is melted down like the Old-Money.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="203"/>
To talk of the Difficulty, is to Frighten our selves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Powerful Party, which are indeed a Party without Power; Difficulties often appear greater at a distance, than when they are search'd into with Judgment, and distinguish'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them.</P>
<P>We are not to be frightned with it; this Age is wiser than that, by all our own Experience, <HI>and theirs too;</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, had early supprest this Party, if he had took more deliberate Measures. In short, 'tis not worth arguing, to talk of their Arms, their <HI>Monmouths,</HI> and <HI>Shafts<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urys,</HI> and <HI>Argiles</HI> are gone, their <HI>Dutch-Sanctuary</HI> is at an end, Heaven has made way for their Destruction, and if we do not close with the Divine occasion, we are to blame our selves, and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by extirpating her im∣placable Enemies, and having let slip the Minute that Heaven presented, may experimentally Complain, <HI>Post est Occasio Calva.</HI></P>
<P>Here are some popular Objections in the way.</P>
<P>As <HI>First,</HI> THE Queen has promis'd them, to continue them in their Tolerated Liberty; and has told us She will be a Religious Observer of Her Word.</P>
<P>WHAT Her Majesty will do we cannot help, but what, as the Head of the Church, She ought to do, is another Case: Her Majesty has promised to Protect and Defend the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and if She cannot effectually do that without the Destruction of the Dissenters, She must of course dispence with one Pro∣mise to comply with another. But to answer <HI>this Cavil more effectually:</HI> Her Majesty did never promise to Maintain the Toleration, to the Destruction of the Church; but it is upon supposition that it may be com∣patible
<PB N="207" REF="204"/>
with the well being and safety of the Church ch which She had declar'd She would take especial Care of: Now if these two Interests clash, 'tis plain Her Majesties Intentions are to Upholds, Protect, De∣fend, and Establish the Church, and this we conceive is impossible.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be said, THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Dissenters, and therefore 'tis time enough: But this is a weak Answer.</P>
<P>For first, IF a Danger be real, the Distance of it is no Argument against, but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention, lest it be too late hereafter.</P>
<P>And 2dly, Here is the Opportunity, and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to secure her self, and destroy her Enemies.</P>
<P>The Representatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity, the Time is come which all good Men ha' wish'd for, that the Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> may serve the Church of <HI>England;</HI> now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of <HI>England</HI> Queen.</P>
<P><HI>What will ye do for your Sister in the Day that She shall be spoken for?</HI></P>
<P>If ever you will establish the best Christian Church in the World.</P>
<P>If ever you will suppress the Spirit of Enthusiosm.</P>
<P>If ever you will free the Nation from the viperous Brood that have so long suck'd the Blood of their Mother.</P>
<P>If ever you will leave your Posterity free from Faction and Rebellion, this is the time.</P>
<P>This is the time to pull up this Heretical Weed of Sedition, that has so long disturb'd the Peace of our Church, and poisoned the good Corn.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="205"/>
BUT, says another Hot and Cold Objector, this is re∣newing Fire and Faggot, reviving the Act <HI>De Heret. Comburendo:</HI> This will be Cruelty in its Nature, and Barbarous to all the World.</P>
<P>I answer, 'TIS Cruelty to kill a Snake or a Toad in cold Blood, but the Poyson of their Nature makes it a Charity to our Neighbours, to destroy those Creatures, not for any personal Injury receiv'd, but for prevention; not for the Evil they have done, but the Evil they may do.</P>
<P>Serpents, Toads, Vipers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are noxious to the Bo∣dy, and poison the sensative Life; these poyson the Soul, corrupt our Posterity, ensnare our Children, destroy the Vitals of our Happiness, our future Filicity, and contaminate the whole Mass.</P>
<P>Shall any Law be given to such wild Creatures? Some Beasts are for Sport, and the Huntsmen give them advantages of Ground; but some are knock'd on the Head by all possible ways of Violence and Sur∣prize.</P>
<P>I do not prescribe Fire and Faggot, but as <HI>Scipio</HI> said of <HI>Carthage, Delenda est Carthago,</HI> They are to be Rooted out of this Nation, is ever we will Live in Peace, serve God, or enjoy our own: As for the Man∣ner, I leave it to those Hands who have a Right to execute God's Justice on the Nations and the Church's Enemies,</P>
<P>BUT if we must be frighted from this Justice un∣der the specious Pretences, and odious Sense of Cru∣elty, nothing will be effected: 'Twill be more Bar∣barous to our own Children, and dear Posterity, when they shall reproach their Fathers, as we do ours, and tell us, <Q REND="inline">'<HI>You had an Opportunity to Root out this Cur∣sed Race from the World, under the Favour and Protection of a true</HI> English <HI>Queen; and out of your foolish Pity you spared them, because, forsooth, you would not be Cruel,</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="206"/>
<HI>and now our Church is Supprest and Persecuted, our Reli∣gion trampl'd under Foot, our Estates Plunder'd, our Per∣sons Imprisoned, and dragg'd to Jails, Gibbets and Scaf∣folds; your sparing this</HI> Amalekite <HI>Race is our Destructi∣on, your Mercy to them proves Cruelty to your poor Po∣sterity.</HI></Q></P>
<P>HOW just will such Reflections be, when our Po∣sterity shall fall under the merciless Clntches of this uncharitable Generation, when our Church shall be swallow'd up in Schism, Faction, Enthusiasm, and Con∣fusion; when our Government shall be devolv'd up∣on Foreigners, and our Monarchy dwindled into a Republick.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be more rational for us, if we must spare this Generation, to summon our own to a general Massacre, and as we have brought them into the World Free, send them out so, and not betray them to Destruction by our supine Negligence, and then cry <HI>it is Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moses</HI> was a Merciful Meek Man, and yet with what Fury did he run thro' the Camp, and cut the Camp, and cut the Throats of Three and thirty thou∣sand of his dear <HI>Israelites,</HI> that were fallen into Idola∣try; what was the reason? 'Twas Mercy to the rest, to make these Examples, to prevent the Destructi∣on of the whole Army.</P>
<P>How many Millions of future Souls we save from Infection and Delusion, if the present Race of poison'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land.</P>
<P>'TIS vain to trifle in this matter, the light foolish handling of them by Mulcts, Fines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis their Glo∣ry and their Advantage, if the Gallows instead of the Counter, and the Gallies instead of the Fines, were the Reward of going to a Conventicle, to preach or hear, there wou'd not be so many Sufferers, the Spi∣rit of Martyrdom is over; they that will go to Church
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
to be chosen Sheriffs and Mayors, would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd.</P>
<P>If one severe Law were made, and punctually ex∣ecuted, that who ever was found at a Conventicle, shou'd be Banish'd the Nation, and the Preacher be Hang'd, we shou'd soon see an end of the Tale, they wou'd all come to Church; and one Age wou'd make us all One again.</P>
<P>TO talk of 5<HI>s.</HI> a Month for not coming to the Sa∣crament, and 1<HI>s. per</HI> Week for not coming to Church this is such a way of converting People as never was known, this is selling them a Liberty to transgress for so much Money: If it be not a Crime, why don't we give them full Licence? And if it be, no Price ought to compound for the committing it, for that is selling a Liberty to People to sin against God and the Government.</P>
<P>If it be a Crime of the highest Consequence both a∣gainst the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, the Glo∣ry of God, the Good of the Church, and the Happi∣ness of the Soul, let us rank it among capital Offences, and let it receive a Punishment in proportion to it.</P>
<P>We Hang Men for Trifles, and Banish them for things not worth naming, but an Offence against God and the Church, against the Welfare of the World, and the Dignity of Religion, shall be bought off for 5<HI>s.</HI> this is such a shame to a Christian Government, that 'tis with regret I transmit it to Posterity.</P>
<P>IF Men sin against God, affront his Ordinances, re∣bel against his Church, and disobey the Precepts of their Superiors, let them suffer as such capital <HI>Crimes</HI> deserve, so will Religion flourish, and this divided Nation be once again united.</P>
<P>And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will soon be taken off from this Law too. I am not supposing that all the Dissenters in <HI>England</HI> shou'd be Hang'd or Banish'd, but as in cases of Rebellions and Insurrecti∣ons,
<PB N="211" REF="208"/>
if a few of the Ring-leaders suffer, the Multitude are dismist, so a few obstinate People being made Ex∣amples, there's no doubt but the Severity of the Law would find a stop in the Compliance of the Multitude.</P>
<P>To make the reasonableness of this matter out of question, and more unanswerably plain, let us exa∣mine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions, and let us see how they can justi∣fie a Separation, or we of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can justifie our bearing the Insults and Inconveniencies of the Party.</P>
<P>ONE of their leading Pastors, and a Man of as much Learning as most among them in his An∣swer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>An Enquiry into the Oc∣casional Conformity,</HI> hath these Words, P. 27. <HI>Do the Religion of the Church and the Meeting-bouses make two Religions? Wherein do they differ? The Substance of the same Religion is common to them both; and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ</HI> P. 28. <HI>Thirty nine Articles are given us for the summary of our Religion, Thirty six contain the Substance of it, wherein we agree; Three the additional Appendices, about which we have some differences.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if as by their own acknowledgment, the Church of <HI>England</HI> is a true Church, and the Diffe∣rence between them is only in a few Modes and Acci∣dents, why should we expect that they will suffer Gal∣lies, corporeal Punishment and Banishment for these Trifles; There is no question but they will be wiser, even their own Principles won't bear them out in it, they will certainly comply with the Laws, and with Reason, and tho' at the first, Severity may seem hard, the next Age will feel nothing of it, the Contagion will be rooted out, the Disease being cur'd, there will be no need of the Operation, but if they should ven∣ture to transgress, and fall into the Pit, all the World must condemn their Obstinacy, as being without ground from their own Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="209"/>
Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off, and the Party actually supprest, and the Disquiets they have so often brought upon the Nation, prevented.</P>
<P>THEIR Numbers, and their Wealth, makes them Haughty, and that 'tis so far from being an Argument to perswade us to forbear them, that 'tis a Warning to us, without any more delay, to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church, or remove them from us.</P>
<P>AT present, Heaven be prais'd, they are not so Formidable as they have been, and 'tis our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so; Providence, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> seems to join in this particular, that now the Destroyers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd, and to this end the present Opportu∣nity seems to be put into our Hands.</P>
<P>To this end Her present Majesty seems reserv'd to enjoy the Crown, that the Ecclesiastick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be restor'd by her Hand.</P>
<P>To this end the Face of Affairs have receiv'd such a Turn in the process of a few Months, as never has been before; the leading Men of the Nation, the u∣niversal cry of the People, the unanimous Request of the Clergy, agree in this, that the Deliverance of our Church is at Hand.</P>
<P>For this end has Providence given us such a Parlia∣ment, such a Convocation, such a Gentry, and such a Queen as we never had before.</P>
<P>AND what may be the <HI>Consequences</HI> of a Neglect of such Opportunities? The Succession of the <HI>Crown</HI> has but a dark Prospect, another <HI>Dutch</HI> Turn may make the Hopes of it ridiculous, and the Practice im∣possible: Be the House of our future Princes never so well inclin'd, they will be Foreigners; and many Years will be spent in suiting the Genius of Strang∣ers to this <HI>Crown,</HI> and the Interests of the Nation; and how many Ages it may be before the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="210"/>
Throne be fill'd with so much Zeal and <HI>Candour,</HI> so much Tenderness, and hearty Affection to the Church, as we see it now cover'd with, who can imagine.</P>
<P>'Tis high time then for the Friends of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to think of Building up, and Establishing her, in such a manner, that She may be no more Inva∣ded by Foreigners, nor Divided by Factions, Schisms, and Error.</P>
<P>IF this cou'd be done by gentle and easie Methods, I shou'd be glad, but the Wound is corroded, the Vitals begin to mortifie, and nothing but Amputation of Members can compleat the Cure; all the ways of Tenderness and Compassion, all perswasive Argu∣ments have been made use of in vain.</P>
<P>THE Humour of the Dissenters has so encreas'd a∣mong the People, that they hold the Church in Defi∣ance, and the House of God is an Abomination among them: Nay, they have brought up their Posterity in such prepossest Aversions to our Holy Religion, that the ignorant Mob think we are all Idolaters, and Wor∣shippers of <HI>Baal;</HI> and account it a Sin to come with∣in the Walls of our Churches.</P>
<P>The primitive Christians were not more shie of a Heathen-Temple, or of Meat offer'd to Idols, nor the <HI>Jews</HI> of Swine's Flesh, than some of our Dissenters are of the Church, and the Divine Service solemnized therein.</P>
<P>THIS Obstinacy must be rooted out with the Pro∣fession of it, while the Generation are left at liberty daily to affront God Almighty, and dishonour his Ho∣ly Worship, we are wanting in our Duty to God, and our Mother the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>How can we answer it to God, to the Church, and to our Posterity, to leave them entangled with Fana∣ticism, Error, and Obstinacy, in the Bowels of the Na∣tion; to leave them an Enemy in their Streets, that in time may involve them in the same Crimes, and en∣danger
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
the utter Extirpation of Religion in the Nation.</P>
<P>WHAT's the Difference betwixt this, and being subjected to the Power of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence we have reform'd? If one be an extream on one Hand, and one on another, 'tis equally Destructive to the Truth, to have Errors settled among us, let them be of what Nature they will.</P>
<P>Both are Enemies of our Church, and of our Peace, and why shou'd it not be as Criminal to admit an En∣thusiast as a Jesuit? Why shou'd the <HI>Papist</HI> with his Seven Sacraments be worse than the <HI>Quaker</HI> with no Sacraments at all? Why should Religious-houses be more intollerable than Meeting-houses—<HI>Alas the Church of England?</HI> What with Popery on one Hand, and Schismaticks on the other; how has She been Crucified between two Thieves.</P>
<P>Now <HI>let us Crucifie the Thieves.</HI> Let her Foundati∣ons be Establish'd upon the Destruction of Her Ene∣mies: The Doors of Mercy being always open to the returning Part of the deluded People: Let the Ob∣stinate be rul'd with the Rod of Iron.</P>
<P>Let all true Sons of so Holy and Oppressed a Mother, exasperated by her Afflictions, harden their Hearts against those who have Oppress'd Her.</P>
<P>And may God Almighty put it into the Hearts of all the Friends of Truth, to lift up a Standard against Pride and Antichrist, that the Posterity of the Sons of Error may be rooted out from the Face of this Land for ever—.</P>

<PB N="215" REF="212"/>
<HEAD>A brief Explanation of a late Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>The Shortest Way with the <HI>Dissenters.</HI></HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Author professes he thought, when he wrote the Book, he shou'd never need to come to an Explication, and wonders to find there should be any reason for it.</P>
<P>If any Man take the Pains seriously to reflect upon the Contents, the Nature of the Thing, and the Man∣ner of the Stile, it seems Impossible to imagine it should pass for any thing but an Irony.</P>
<P>That it is free from any Seditious design, either of stirring up the Dissenters to any Evil Practice by way of prevention; much less of animating others to their Destruction, will be plain, I think, to any Man that understands the present Constitution of <HI>England,</HI> and the Nature of our Government.</P>
<P>But since Ignorance, or Prejudice has led most Men to a hasty Censure of the Book, and several poor Peo∣ple are like to come under the Displeasure of the Go∣vernment for it, in Justice to those who are in danger to suffer for it; in Humble submission to the Parlia∣ment and Council, who may be offended at it; and in Courtesie to all mistaken People, who it seems have not Penetrated into the real design: The Author presents the World with the Native Genuine Meaning and De∣sign of the Paper, which he hopes may allay the An∣ger of the Government, or at least satisfie the minds of such as imagine a design to Enflame and Divide us.</P>
<P>The Paper, without the least retrospect to, or con∣cern in the Publick Bills in Parliament, now depen∣ding; or any other Proceedings of either House, or of the Government relating to the Dissenters, whose
<PB N="216" REF="213"/>
Occasional Conformity the Author has constantly op∣posed, has its immediate Original from the Virulent Spirits of some Men who have thought fit to express themselves to the same Effect, in their Printed Books, <HI>tho' not in Words so plain, and at length,</HI> and by an <HI>Irony not Unusual;</HI> stands as a fair answer to several Books Published <HI>in this Liberty of the Press;</HI> which, if they had been handed to the Government with the same temper as this has, wou'd no question ha' found the same Treatment.</P>
<P>The Sermon Preach'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the <HI>New Association,</HI> the <HI>Poetical Observator,</HI> with numberless others; have said the same thing, in terms very little darker, and this Book stands fair to let those Gentlemen know that what they design can no farther take with Mankind than as their real meaning stands disguis'd by Artifice of words; but that when the Persecution and De∣struction of the <HI>Dissenters, the very thing they drive at,</HI> is put into plain <HI>English,</HI> the whole Nation will start at the Notion, and Condemn the Author to be Hang'd for his Impudence.</P>
<P>The Author humbly hopes he shall find no harder Treatment for plain <HI>English without Design,</HI> than those Gentlemen for their Plain Design in Duller and Darker <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Any Gentlemen who have Patience to peruse the Author of the <HI>New Association,</HI> will find Gallows, Galleys, Persecution and Destruction of the Dissenters are directly pointed at, as fairly intended, and de∣sign'd as in this shortest way, as, <HI>had it been real,</HI> can be pretended; there is as much Virulence against a Union with <HI>Scotland,</HI> against King <HI>WILLIAM</HI>'s Government, and against the Line of <HI>Hannover</HI> there is as much Noise and Pains taken in Mr. <HI>S—s</HI> Sermon to blacken the Dissenters, and thereby to qualifie them for the Abhorrence of all Mankind, as is possible.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="214"/>
The meaning then of this Paper is in short to tell these Gentlemen,</P>
<P N="1">1. That 'tis Nonsence to go round about, and tell us of the Crimes of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> to prepare the World to believe they are not fit to Live in a Humane Society, that they are Enemies to the Government, and Law, to the QUEEN, and the Publick Peace, and the like; <HI>the shortest way,</HI> and the soonest, wou'd be to tell us plainly that they wou'd have them all hang'd, Banish'd and Destroyed.</P>
<P N="2">2. But withal to acquaint those Gentlemen who fancy the time is come to bring it to pass, that they are mistaken, for that when the thing they mean, is put into plain <HI>English,</HI> the whole Nation replies with the <HI>Assyrian</HI> Captain, <HI>Is thy Servant a Dog, that he shou'd do these things?</HI> The Gentlemen are mistaken in every partlcular, it will not go down, the QUEEN, the Council, the Parliament are all Offended, to have it so much as suggested, that such a thing was possible to come into their Minds; and not a Man, but a Learn∣ed <HI>Mercer,</HI> not far from the Corner of <HI>Fanchurch-street,</HI> has been found to approve it.</P>
<P>Thus a poor Author has ventur'd to have all Man∣kind call him Villain and Traytor to his Country and Friends, for making other Peoples thoughts speak in his Words.</P>
<P>From this Declaration of his real design, he humbly hopes the Lords of Her Majesties Council, or the House of Parliament, will be no longer offended, and that the poor People in trouble on this Account shall be Pardoned or Excused.</P>
<P>He also desires that all men who have taken Offence at the Book, mistaking the Authors design; will suf∣fer themselves to think again, and withhold their Censure till they find themselves qualified to make a Venture like this for the good of their Native Coun∣trey.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="215"/>
As to Expressions which seem to reflect upon Per∣sons or Nations; he declares them to be only <HI>the Cant of the Nonjuring Party Expos'd,</HI> and thinks it very ne∣cessary to let the World know that 'tis their usual Language with which they Treat the <HI>Late KING,</HI> the <HI>Scotch Ʋnion,</HI> and the <HI>Line of Hannover.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis hard, after all, that this should not be percei∣ved by all the Town, that not one man can see it, ei∣ther Churchman or Dissenter.</P>
<P>That not the Dissenters themselves can see that this was the only way to satisfy them, that whatever the Parliament might think fit to do to restrain Occasion∣al Communion, Persecution and Destruction was ne∣ver in their intention, and that therefore they ha' no∣thing to do but to be quiet and easie.</P>
<P>For any thing in the manner of the Paper which may offend either the Government, Parliament, or private Persons, the Author humbly begs their Par∣don, and <HI>protesting the Honesty of his intention,</HI> resolves, if the poor People now in Trouble may be excused, to throw himself upon the Favour of the Government rather than others shall be ruin'd for his mistakes.</P>

<P>Suppose it Sir, what then?</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, don't be Angry, are you the reputed Author? <HI>A.</HI> Come off <HI>you Taught me in one of your Pa∣pers about</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I wanted a little Discourse with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be Civil, as you say, you are Welcome, but you begin odly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Questions may be Blunt, but you are not bound to Answer them, but let that be as you like 'em.</P>
<P>First, Pray who do you reckon is the Author of this Devilish Book, call'd, <HI>The Shortest Way?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall Answer most of your Questions with a Question, I believe, and begin with you here.</P>
<P>Do you think my Name is Mr. <HI>Bellamy,</HI> that you take me for <HI>an Informer?</HI> Read the <HI>Gazette,</HI> there you have the Man with the <HI>Sharp Chin,</HI> and a <HI>Dutch Nose.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but Sir, we begin to doubt that is not the true Author, that he has been only made the Tool of
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
some other Party, who now they find the World Ex∣asperated at it, have slipt out of the Noose, and left him it; we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality, and there is such a design on foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Answer, like Parson <HI>Jacobs</HI> Text, ought to be taken a pieces and Explain'd.</P>
<P N="1">1, If you are not sure he is the Author, you <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI> have done him a great deal of wrong, for you have rail'd at him more than all the rest of the World, and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well possible for one Man to be Guilty of.</P>
<P N="2">2. And yet by supposing him not to be the Author, yon suppose him to be very Honest to his Friends, that he bears all this without discovering them</P>
<P N="3">3. As for your fears of a real design, to put the <HI>Shortest way</HI> in practice upon you, no Question there are abundance of People in the World, who would be glad there was not one of you left; I believe no Body doubts it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Pray who do you think they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Sir your humble Servant; no <HI>Bellamy,</HI> I tell you not I Sir: If I were in a Plot with the Devil, I le never Evidence, besides Sir, I have no mind to have my Nose and Chin describ'd, but if you please I'll answer you Negatively, who I believe is not concern'd in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be some Satisfaction, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the Queen Sir, not the Parliament, not the Council, not the Army, not the Ministers of State, not the Government.</P>

<P>Thou art a safe Man, thou'lt never go to <HI>New∣gate</HI> for Negatives.</P>
</SP>

<P>No Sir, nor for Positives neither if I can help it; but you have had your Will at Catechising, and I ought to have my turn, let me ask you a few Questions too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray why are you Dissenters Angry at the Book call'd, <HI>The Shortest Way;</HI> 'Tis a little Mysterious, Sir,
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
that tho the <HI>Church Men</HI> are Affronted, because 'twas Written against them, and the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are Affron∣ted, because 'tis Wrote against them too, I don't well understand it, one sort must be Fools, that's certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care whether I understand it or no, he is a <HI>Rogue,</HI> a <HI>Villain,</HI> and I wish the Government had him, if I knew where he was, I'd deliver him up, and <HI>abate them the</HI> 501.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spoken like a <HI>Dissenter</HI> truly, so that I find you are Angry at him, because you don't understand him and the Government because they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are so sharp upon me, I do understand a little too, I understand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with, and he is a Man they say who has been the occasion of all this Persecution which is com∣ing upon us, by railing at <HI>Occasional Conformity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he expos'd you for <HI>Occasional Conformity,</HI> 'tis what you ought to have Rectify'd your selves, that you need not have been expos'd for it; and in that he was your Friend, for had you took the hint, and exploded the Practice, there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what had he to do with that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, what had Mr. <HI>How</HI> to do to meddle with it afterward, I'll assure you his Name is down in my Pocket-Book, and when any Man in <HI>England</HI> defends a Cause worse, I'll put his name out, and put t'others Name in: But pray Sir, why do you call this bringing Persecution upon you; do you suppose the <HI>Occasional</HI> Bill will be a Persecution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt it will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>What sort of Persecution can you call it? it can't be a Persecution for Conscience sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why pray Sir, suppose one of your Brethren <HI>Dissenters,</HI> who can go to the <HI>Meeting</HI> to Day, and to the <HI>Church</HI> to Morrow; take the Sacrament to Day
<PB N="222" REF="219"/>
fitting, and to Morrow to get a good place, go to <HI>Church</HI> and take it kneeling; wipe his Mouth and go home to Dinner, and so to Meeting again; suppose this Gen∣tleman should be put up for <HI>Sherriff,</HI> or <HI>Lord Mayor,</HI> can this Man pretend Conscience not to Conform? I tell you Sir, Mr. <HI>How</HI> must make a better Answer to the matter before I can be convinc'd, you may call it Persecution but it can never be for Conscience sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Persecution is Persecution, let it be for what sake it will, every man ought to be at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that is true, I am for Liberty for every man to serve God as is most agreeable to his Consci∣ence: But this is not serving God at all: besides Sir, I could easily make it appear, this Act is for your Ad∣vantage, if you were a sort of People to be convinc'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, how Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, it will purge you of all your half in half Professors. That's one thing; then it will put all those Gentlemen into a capacity of being in pla∣ces and Parliaments, who tho' by this Act they are se∣parated from you, and rejoin'd to the Church because they can conform, will still be friends to your Interest in all Publick Concerns; and therefore had I been to word the Bill so as to have done most harm, it shou'd have excluded all that ever were Dissenters, and have forc'd you to continue so, and not have ac∣cepted your return to the Church without a public Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you may perswade us 'tis for our advantage, but we don't like it, and therefore we hate him for medling with it; for what had he to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>About as much as you and I have to do with him, if a man meddles with what does not concern him, that's his Fault, and if we who really have no∣thing to do with him, meddle with him, that is our Fault, let the Government alone with him, have you nothing else to talk no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="223" REF="220"/>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why all the Town has talkt of him as well as we.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and reckon'd up all his Faults, all the sins that ever he committed in his Life, and abundance more; be the man who he will, and what he will, I don't see but the best of us would be loth all the Faults we have should be reckon'd up and writ in our Fore∣heads, as his are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he has been a most wicked Wretch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>You force a man to be an Advocate for One he has no kindness for; a wicked wretch you say; why has he been a Thief, a Murderer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No no, I don't mean that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has he been Clipper or Coyner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No no, nor that neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has he been a Whoremaster or a Drunkard, or a Swearer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't say so neither, but he broke and can't pay his Debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had said he had broke and won't pay his Debts, you had said more to the purpose.</P>
<P>But I must do one piece of Justice to the man, tho' I love him no better than you do, that is this: That meeting a Gentleman in a <HI>Coffee-House,</HI> where I and every body else was railing at him, the Gentleman took us up with this short Speech.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, said, he, I know this D' <HI>Foe</HI> as well as any of you, and I was one of his Creditors, and I Compounded with him, and discharg'd him fully; and several Years afterward he sent for me, and tho' he was clearly discharg'd he paid me all the Remainder of his Debt Voluntarily, and of his own accord: And he told me, that as fast as God should enable him, he Intended to do so with every Body; when he had done, he desired me to set my Hand to a Paper to ac∣knowledge it, which I readily did, and found a great many Names to the Paper, before me, and I think my
<PB N="224" REF="221"/>
self bound to own it, tho' I am no Friend to the Book he has wrote, no more than you. What do you think of this Story?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think of it, I don't belive it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help that, nor I care not whether you do or no, but I assure you after I heard it, I never rail'd at him any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I'll rail at him for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>You Dissenters are in something like Case with the <HI>Pharisees;</HI> when the Question was put to them by our Saviour about <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism; whether it was from Heaven or of Men. If a Man should ask you of the <HI>Shortest Way,</HI> was it wrote for you or against you? If you should say for us, you would be askt why then are you so mad with the Author? And if you should say against you, the People would laugh at you; for all Men but you see into it, and that a Dissenter wrote it; you must say therefore, we cannot tell, and con∣sequently, that you rail at the Author for you can't tell what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we don't count him a Dissenter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has all the Marks of a Dissenter upon him, but <HI>want of Brains.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are we so empty of Brains pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is reason for it, God has given you <HI>Equi∣valents.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a further Testimony of your being a Dissenter; why if you will have it, take it, I say, <HI>God Almighty would have seem'd unkind to you, if he had not given you a great deal of Grace? For he has given you but little Wit.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>I hope they'll take him still,</HI> I should be glad to see him hang'd for it, I am sure he deserves it, I heard one met him a little while ago, wou'd I had been there.</P>

<P>Any how, so I could but have taken him.</P>
</SP>

<P>Ay, and they say 'twas one of your own Party too, and one that wou'd fain have got the 50<HI>l.</HI> but that he drew upon him, Frighted him out of his Wits and made him down of his Knees and Swear that if ever he met him again, he should shut his eyes till he was half a mile off him.</P>

<P>No not I.</P>

<P>So I thought by your Charity and good Nature; I know him not neither, but the man has the Govern∣ment upon his Back already, and if they take him they'l avenge your Quarrel for you. Let him alone, 'tis In∣generous, as I said before in print, to triumph over a Man in his Affliction: 'Twas but a little while ago he wrote a Book that pleas'd you, and then you cry'd him up as much as now you cry him down.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this 'tis to oblige a <HI>Dissenter,</HI> if you serve them a hundred times 'tis well, but once get your Head in the Pillory for them, and they'l be the first to palt you with rotten Eggs; what can't you set down one good thing and one bad, and ballance with him: You under∣stand Accompts well enough; but you <HI>Dissenters,</HI> are like a Shop-keeper I knew, who having Traded 20 Year with a Gentleman, and serv'd all his Family and gotten a great deal of Money by him, at last the poor

<P>No indeed, shou'd I not?</P>

<P>Well, But you see he denies it, and challenges you to prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, deny it, I told you he was no Fool, indeed I am not glad I Printed it, for tho' it is charged upon him by common Fame, I am not for hanging Men upon suppositions as you do.</P>

<P>And when I am gone, you'll call me as many Rogues as you do him, won't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it may be I shan't, but I can tell you of some that do already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all one to me, common Fame like a com∣mon Strumpet, jilts every Body, but methinks Slander and Reproach, out of the Mouth of a Dissenter comes with some more than common ill savour.</P>

<P>They think they have good reason for it upon you.</P>

<P>And I think not, pray what are their good Reasons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>For abusing your Friends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Friends, prithee who are they? I know but very few I have, and I am very sure I never abus'd them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>They all agree you would not be permitted to write so long, but the Party would have ruffled you before now, only you court them and please them by a Side-Wind, with your railing at King <HI>William</HI>'s Friends sometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>King <HI>William</HI>'s Enemies you mean; look, Sir, I have as much Veneration for the Memory of King <HI>William</HI> as any of you, and do but once prove them to be King <HI>William</HI>'s Friends, and I'll own all you say, and recant all I have wrote.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's easie to prove they were his Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Sir, don't you Tax me with abusing King <HI>William,</HI> and abuse him your self, I have prov'd suffici∣ently they were the Nations Enemies: Now if you can prove the Nations Enemies were K. <HI>William</HI>'s Friends, you'll make a fine spot of Work on't indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Nations Enemies! That is, because being in great places, they got as much Money as they could, and so would you do, and so have all the Favourites that ever were or will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>When ever Favourites did, do or shall get Mo∣ney by rapine or injustice, and oppression of the Sub∣ject, they were and will be the Nations Enemies and their Soveraigns too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what have you to do with it? 'Tis none of your Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis every Mans business to discover mischief, fraud and ill design, as much as every Man who first spies Fire, has a duty upon him to raise the Neigh∣bours: I am a Subject, and am Cheated among the rest.</P>

<P>You Cheated, why what have you to lose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="228" REF="225"/>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Liberty, which you said but now, every Man had a Right to, and my Money when I have it; what's that to you, how little, or much I have, and how do you know how much I may have hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they say you get Money by Railing, and so you may soon be Rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I Rail for something, and you get none, and yet you Rail; Pray who has the best Excuse for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that has the best Reason for it, not he that gets the most Money by it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe if you could get Money by Railing, you would count it the best Reason in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because you are so willing to Rail at any Body, when you know not for what, nor why, and charge People with Crimes they never Committed; of all your Christian Duties, you make the least use of your Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, since you put so hard, I can tell the time when you abus'd King <HI>William</HI> himself, as openly as you durst speak it, or any body dare Print, particu∣larly in a Poem of yours, call'd the <HI>Foreigners.</HI></P>

<P>I tell you, there's no People in the World so forward to Condemn a Man upon hear say, as the <HI>Dis∣senters,</HI> when they have a Mind to slander a Man, they take every thing upon trust, 'tis their <HI>Shortest Way.</HI></P>

<P>These Scribling People are always medling with things they have nothing to do with; what have you to do with Kings and Favourites, or that t'other Fellow with the <HI>Shortest Way:</HI> You Pamphleteers are always Quacking with the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come let's turn the Tables, now it's my Play, what have you to do with Acts of Parliaments; you
<PB N="229" REF="226"/>
Dissenters are always thrusting in your Oar too; what have you to do to talk of Persecution and Acts against <HI>Occasional Conformity,</HI> you are Mountebanking with the State too in every Coffee-House, Pray med∣dle with your own Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall have to do with it, when we feel it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perswaded if you were put to it severely, few of you would stay to feel it, at least few of your Wealthy Members, few of Mr. <HI>Hows</HI> Mind, few of such Dissenters as go from <HI>Meeting</HI> to <HI>Church,</HI> and can back-stroke and fore-stroke, Communicate on both sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they may not, but we are afraid 'twill not only be a Persecution, but a very long one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you are beholding to the Author we talkt of, for you see he is for putting you out of your Pain, but I am of a different Opinion from you in se∣veral of your darkest thoughts about Persecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is your Opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P N="1">1. I am of Opinion that if your Enemies were true Masters of Politicks, they would not Persecute you at all, I take you to be a declining Party, Tolera∣tion will be your Ruin; and if God in Mercy to you don't send a Persecution among you, you are lost, you will all dwindle back into the <HI>Church</HI> again; your old stock of Ministers dye off, your <HI>Owens, Mantons, Char∣nocks, Clarksons, Baxters,</HI> and <HI>Bates</HI>'s are gone; and Pray what can you name out of the new Generation of your <HI>Leyden</HI> Doctors fit to succeed them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Occasional Bill at once carries off your Wealthy Members, who are the support of your Cler∣gy, and as Mr. <HI>William</HI>'s very well observed at <HI>Salters-Hall, If the Rich ones forsake you, the Party will be weaken'd so as to make you fear the Dissolution of the whole.</HI> Indeed the Gentleman was in the right, if the Wealthy Mem∣bers quit the Congregations, 'twill make poor work for the Ministers, and they like other People Gene∣rally do their Work best where they have best Wages.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you had Lov'd the <HI>Dissenters</HI> better than to abuse them at this rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't abuse them, I wish them clear of all their Hypocrites, and that there were none among them but what were <HI>Dissenters</HI> for meer Conscience: If that were so, 'twould make their Enemies at Peace with them, they'd never be Persecuted; the Govern∣ment would Cherish them, and be as tender of them as they would desire. But to be plain with you, 'tis your own Pride, and Pushing at great things has made you Obnoxious, and withall your discovering by an Alter∣nate double fac'd Conscience, that while you pretend to Dissent, and to have tender Consciences, you can nevertheless Conform, if you please; this makes your Enemies suspect your Honesty, and apprehend more trick and design in you, than I hope they need. Nay, this gives your Enemies such advantage against you, as you can never Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think any Man ought to be confin'd by Laws and Acts of Parliaments about his Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be I think so too; but Men ought to be Honest to their own Principles, whether there were Laws or no; and if I see a Man pretend he can't Con∣form, and upon occasion I find he can, it makes me sus∣pect his Honesty, and if I once think a Man a Knave, I am not to blame to fence my self against him by Laws: I tell you an Act of Parliament to keep you Honest, can never be call'd Persecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, if there was no more in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>If there be any more in it, I wish there was not, I'm sure I know not what is in it, and I believe you don't neither; Pray have you seen the Bill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No not I, but I hear 'tis a very Terrible Bill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>True to the old way still, <HI>always to Judge before you Hear.</HI> Indeed I forgot to ask you, but on my Conscience I don't believe you ever read the Book of the <HI>Shortest way;</HI> Come, be Honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Read it, why the very Out-side of that is enough for any Man to read; I thank God I spend my time better.</P>

<P>I think you ought to spend your time better too, than to give your Verdict upon any thing before you read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a strange Man, why every body says 'tis a horrible Book, and not fit to be read, but what's that to this Act of Parliament?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus much 'tis, that you cry out Persecu∣tion from this Act of Parliament, and there's not a word of Persecution in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think 'tis Persecution, if I must not be at Li∣berty to Worship God as I think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still you are without Book, why you may be a Dissenter all the days of your Life, and go to Meet∣ings as long as you live, and never be troubled by this Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't imagine what you mean, why I must Pay, God knows what, if I am seen at a Meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, that's after you have strain'd your Conscience from the Meeting to the Church; after you have bob'd your Religion to be Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> or the like; and then want to go back again; but if you, to keep your Conscience, can be content to be without these gay things call'd Places, you may be a Dissenter to the end of the Chapter: So that this will only be a Persecution for Honour sake, not for Con∣science sake, and never fall upon you neither, till you bring it upon your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I hope it won't pass for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope so too, but if it don't, it must be <HI>the Lords doing, and it will be marvellous in our Eyes.</HI></P>

<P>The House of Lords you mean, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must mean as you will have me, let it be how it will, but if I hope it will not pass, it's from diffe∣rent reasons with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="232" REF="229"/>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, your reasons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am against (and ever shall be) Im∣posing any Religious Ordinance or part of Worship as a Qualification for any Temporal Employment. Let the Princes be at full liberty to employ who, or what sort of their Subjects they see Cause. 2. Such impositions are a Bait to People to Banter their Consciences, and to comply with that for a Preferment, which otherwise they wou'd not, and so seem to lead them into Temptation: But I don't know the Contents of the Bill, therefore I'll say no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I wou'd not have it pass, because I take it to be a Foundation of Persecution; 'tis but pulling down the Toleration next, and then we are all undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You Faithless and Perverse Generation!</HI> Has not the QUEEN promis'd to maintain your To∣leration? Besides, what's that to the Bill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why shou'd not we be afraid of it, as well as some of the Church-Party have the confidence to <HI>hope</HI> it? Nay, to condemn the Toleration as Anti∣christian, and threaten us with the having it over∣thrown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why these are for <HI>the Shortest way;</HI> you ought to rail at them as much as you do at the Man with the <HI>hook Nose,</HI> and <HI>sharp Chin,</HI> and more too; and no doubt but if you would turn Informer, you might hook their Noses into the <HI>Gazett</HI> too, to be sure the Government would not allow of it; they would ne∣ver suffer the QUEEN to be so affronted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know how 'tis, such things are suf∣fer'd daily. I heard our Parson t'other day say at a Publick Dinner 'twou'd never be well with <HI>England</HI> till some Course was taken to reconcile all Dissen∣ters to the Church, <HI>Longest way,</HI> or <HI>Sherrest,</HI> 'twas all one to him; he said he hop'd to see the Church
<PB N="233" REF="230"/>
flourish without them; and a great deal more, and worse than this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a topping high-flying Gentleman indeed, and why did you not acquaint the Govern∣ment with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think I am an Informer? My Name is not <HI>Bellamy</HI> any more than yours, but pray why do you make so strange of it? Don't we hear daily People expressing their high flying hopes that a Par∣liament in <HI>Scotland</HI> will restore Episcopacy there, and yet has not the Queen given Her word, and publish∣ed it in our <HI>Gazett,</HI> that she will maintain the Pres∣byterian Government there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she so? Then tho' they have the impu∣dence to hope, you ought not to have the ignorance to fear it. The QUEEN gave her Word to maintain it! <HI>be not slow of Heart to believe.</HI> She has taken up the famous Motto of Q. <HI>Elizabeth, Semper Eadem,</HI> and can you so much as doubt she will deface it, for a few <HI>Scotch</HI> Bishops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for my fears, I beg Her Majesties Pardon, there are so many Turns and Windings in Law and State matters, that we know not what to say to things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say! Why a promise is a promise, and you may depend upon it, she has never broke her Word with us yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but what if the Parliament should do it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if the Parliament does it, we do it our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good, so that we may be undone, and the Toleration Bill taken away; and yet the QUEEN be as good as Her Word still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, so you may, whenever an Act of Par∣liament
<PB N="234" REF="231"/>
becomes so without the Royal Assent, and when do you think that can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then these High-Flying Church-Men are very impudent Fellows, to suggest such things of the QUEEN, and to bully us with overturning the Toleration, and put us in such fears of what they will do to us, when it can never be done without the QEEN's acting so directly against Her Royal-Promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I think they ought to be us'd as they us'd the Author of the <HI>Shortest Way,</HI> Gazetted and a Reward for the Discoverer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or as you have us'd him rather, <HI>viz. Rail at them, for being of your own side:</HI> you Dissenters are rare Fellows for Punishments, if God should have no more Mercy on you, than you shew to all Men that offend you, we should have <HI>Plagues, Pestilence,</HI> and <HI>Famine</HI> every Year upon us; so now you are come about again, these High-Flying <HI>Churchmen</HI> have Bul∣ly'd you with the fears of losing your Toleration, come confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And made you distrrst the QUEEN's Ve∣racity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Diss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, GOD and the QUEEN forgive us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have Terrifi'd you with what things they'll do when they have pull'd down your Antichri∣stian Toleration, have they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you thought the <HI>Shortest Way</HI> was Wrote to make a beginning with you, and to set the <HI>Dragoons of the Church</HI> upon your Backs; did you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>And continued of the same mind like an <HI>Ig∣noramus,</HI> tho' you heard 'twas Wrote by one of your own Party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="235" REF="232"/>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now pray, after so much patience as I have had with you, have a little with me; and if I can, I'le set you right in your Thoughts of these things.</P>
<P>There are a sort of People among the <HI>Dissenters</HI> who can either Dissent or Conform, as they find their Inclinations or Interest rather directs them, these by their Wealth and Interest have always put themselves into good places, and qualifi'd themselves for that purpose, by taking the Sacrament: Of these People, even the most moderate <HI>Church Men</HI> have an ill Opi∣nion, and truly so have Two Thirds of your own Friends, for it looks as if they were Men of no Prin∣ciples at all.</P>
<P>Against these Men the Act against <HI>Occasional Confor∣mity</HI> is principally design'd, and if there was nothing else in the Bill, I believe no good Man would be a∣gainst it.</P>
<P>Concerning these things, Two sorts of People have been very grosly mistaken, and upon their Mistakes have proceeded to Act very Foolishly.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The high Flying <HI>Church Party</HI> begun to think, all was a going their own way, and that the Govern∣ment would fall in with them, and do your business for you, and away they run with the Notion, and Preach you down, and Print you down, and Talk you down like Mad Men; there is Sermon upon Sermon, Pamphlet upon Pamphlet: One says you are all Rogues and Hypocrites, another says you are Enemies to the Government, one Flies at the Toleration, and tells the World 'tis Destructive to the Nations Happiness, and the Politicians must pull it down; another says 'tis Antichristian, and we cannot be true Sons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if we don't pull it down; others like hare-brain'd Huntsmen that over run the Hounds roar you down with full Cry, till they run themselves out of Breath; others are for having you depriv'd of
<PB N="236" REF="233"/>
Voices in Elections of Parliaments, in hopes of Ar∣riving to that Blessed Day, when they shall have a Parliament of their own Mind; and thus they Run before they are Sent, and without Reflecting upon their ill grounded Zeal, without examining any Au∣thorities, other than their Passions, without regard to good manners, taking no Notice of the Preamble of the Act of Parliament, which Declares against Perse∣cution, or the Honour and Sacred Promise of Her MAJESTY, given to make Her Subjects easie, they blow up the Fire of Persecution and Destruction, whe∣ther the Government will or no.</P>
<P>You are the next sort of People, who are mistaken, for being Naturally a little Hypish, as the Beaus call it, troubled with the Spleen, and Hypocondriack Va∣pours, this Cloud of Raillery so darken'd your Un∣derstanding, that you presently take these People and the QUEEN, these People and the Government, these People and the Parliament, to be all of a mind; and the QUEEN having displac't all your Friends, as 'tis but just, <HI>That all Princes should employ who they please:</HI> And the Parliament falling on your <HI>Occasional Conformers,</HI> and this Book of <HI>the Shortest way</HI> coming out altogether, the high Church Party Thundred at you from the Press and the Pulpit: Away you run with the Notion that you are all to be blown up, that all these Things aim'd at your Destruction, and that Fire and Faggot was at the Door.</P>
<P>But the Government is steady, and the QUEEN still has maintained her Motto, the Parliament steers in the middle way, going about to restrain, but not to destroy you; and taking no notice either of the heat of one party, or Folly of the other, they hold the Ballance of your Liberty between your exorbitant License, and the other party's unchristian Fury; and in my opinion, thus far are you safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then why has not the Government thought
<PB N="237" REF="234"/>
fit to disown the Zeal of these High-flyers, by punish∣ment, and make Examples of some of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, the Dissenters were all for Punish∣ments and Examples, for the same reason that they have not punished you for supecting the QUEEN's Honesty to her word, charging the Parliament with going about to persecute you, and the like; for this reason, because they are more merciful than both par∣ties deserve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twould have convinc'd us very plainly of two very significant Things. <HI>First,</HI> That there is such a Design, and then that the Authors of it receiv'd no Countenance from Court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Manners and Common Justice ought to have convinc'd you of the last, and your Author of <HI>the Shortest way,</HI> to his Cost, open'd your Eyes in the first, if you had not wilfully shut them against the Light.</P>
<P N="1">1. Good Manners would inform you, not to doubt the Word of your Prince, 'till you had some reason from Her MAJESTY her self.</P>
<P N="2">2. Common Justice commands us to suppose every Person just and honest, till something appears to the contrary; and it is a very unchristian, uncharitable way of teaching the QUEEN, That because some of the high Church-men have had the Indiscretion, with∣out her Authority, to swagger you out of your Sen∣ses; therefore you must suppose her Promise broken, and her Word of no value.</P>
<P>The Author of <HI>the Shortest way</HI> comes with a Lan∣thorn for you, and he sums up all the black Things this high Party had publish'd, into one General, and if you had any Eyes, you might learn two Things from <HI>which he is like to pay dear enough for teaching you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> From the general abhorrence Mankind shew∣ed of the Book, you might learn that the destruction of our Party is a Cruelty not to be found in the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="235"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> From the Out-cry made against it by that Party in particular, you might learn who they were that were toucht in the Book, and where the design against them lay.</P>
<P>As to the Quarrel you Dissenters have at the Book, <HI>That's a Mystery no Man can Unriddle but your selves.</HI> 'Tis like Mr. <HI>Mead</HI>'s Wheel within a Wheel, and a further Testimony to the World that you are a most unaccountable People, whose ways are past finding out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you would go about to perswade me the Book was writ of our side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Sir, 'tis hard to know what side you are of, and</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Sir, I know you too well to go about to perswade you to any thing, whose peculiar Talent is to be unperswadeable; but if you will please to answer me a few Questions you may perhaps perswade your self of something or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Questions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are the high Church-men angry with him, while at the same time they openly declare 'tis the only way to deal with you, and what they would feign be at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truely you puzzle me a little there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Obs.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are angry, because they take the Book as the Author meant it, and you, because you take it as he wrote it, they as he meant, <HI>viz. to expose them,</HI> and tho' they are heartily willing to do you a Kindness that way, and have shewn their good Will by their words, yet knowing they wanted Power to Execute it, and being conscious to themselves that the Government was not of their Opinion; they are enrag'd to have all their designs laid open in Minature, and an Abridg∣ment communicated to the World in <HI>true Billingsgate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dis.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be some truth in this, but Pray why then is the Government so angry with him? I believe I have puzzled you now.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LEX TALIONIS.</HI> OR, AN ENQUIRY INTO The most Proper Ways to Prevent THE PERSECUTION OF THE Protestants in <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>EƲROPE</HI> has now for nine Years past been afflicted with a Bloody, a Cruel, and a Destru∣ctive War, carried on with a vast Effusion of Blood and Treasure; and in all Parts of it manag'd with more Eagerness and Fury, than any War among
<PB N="243" REF="240"/>
the <HI>European</HI> Princes ever was in the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> who are Masters of Address, used all the Skill and Cunning with the Roman Catholick <HI>Princes,</HI> especially those of <HI>Italy,</HI> to have made it pass for a <HI>War of Religion,</HI> thinking by that fineness to have drawn them off from the Confederacy. But <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. who, 'twas likely, knew as much of Religi∣on, and the Interest of the Church, as the States∣men of <HI>France,</HI> saw through that Artifice, and readily agreed with the Emperour, and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> That the Growing Greatness of <HI>France,</HI> and the Mea∣sures laid for the Subjecting <HI>Europe</HI> to her Govern∣ment were really more dangerous things, and of more immediate Consequence to the Publick Liberty, than the Matter of Religion could be: And therefore, tho' the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> made some seeming Difficulties at first; yet the <HI>French</HI> having thrown off the Mask, and fallen upon his Catholick Confederate the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the most Bigotted Romanist made no scruple to entertain the Heretick Soldiers, to recall the ban∣ish'd <HI>Vaudois,</HI> to fight under the Command of <HI>Prote∣stant</HI> Generals, to accept of the Subsidial Supplies of <HI>Protestant</HI> Money, and the protection of <HI>Protestant</HI> Armies; thereby evidently declaring to the World, that this was a War of State, not of Religion; and that the real Interest of <HI>Princes,</HI> is to preserve them∣selves, and their Subjects, against a too powerful <HI>In∣vader,</HI> by Leagues and Assistances, let their Religious Interests be what they will.</P>
<P>Nor have the <HI>Protestant Princes</HI> tho' their Forces in this Confederacy have been much Superior, been back∣ward to push on the Common Interest with their utmost Vigour, but have with extraordinary chear∣fulness assisted the Roman Catholick Confederates with their Armies, Fleets, and Moneys; witness the Subsidies paid to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> by the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="241"/>
and <HI>Dutch;</HI> the Army maintain'd, under the Com∣mand of Duke <HI>Schombergh</HI> in <HI>English</HI> pay in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the Forces Ship'd from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to aid the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which sav'd the City of <HI>Barcelona</HI> a whole Year; Witness also the <HI>English</HI> Fleet Wintering at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> under Admiral <HI>Russel;</HI> the Squadron sent to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to Relieve <HI>Carthagena:</HI> And indeed the whole Series of the War has been one continual Instance of the Safety and Protection the Roman Ca∣tholick Countries have enjoy'd by the Sword and Power of the Protestant Interest.</P>
<P>So that it has been apparent beyond the power of Contradiction, that this has been a War of State, not a War of Religion: Nor can I imagine, generally speak∣ing, that it can ever be the Interest of the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> take them together, to Commence a War of Religion: For tho' 'tis true, That the <HI>Pope</HI> always Exalted both his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Credit,</HI> in the blind Ages of bigotted Devotion, by his Crusadoes and Holy Ex∣peditions; yet since, the World has more Years over its Head, and the Cheat has been discovered, <HI>Int'rest</HI> has prevail'd too much upon Devotion to be deceiv'd any more at that rate: And the Reformed Kingdoms of <HI>Europe,</HI> are too potent to be us'd so any more.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion has lost Ground in <HI>France;</HI> and that Kingdom where once the <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> were Strong enough to Contend with their Go∣vernours for their Liberty, is now wholly <HI>Roman,</HI> at least seems to be so. But notwithstanding that, I be∣lieve the Protestant Interest in <HI>Europe,</HI> very well able to stand a shock with the Popish, when ever the Pope thinks fit to publish another <HI>Bloody Jubilee,</HI> and <HI>display</HI> the Standard of St. <HI>Peter</HI> against St. <HI>Paul.</HI> And not to descend to particulars, I shall only Draw up the several Kingdoms, on each Side, who would form this Great Division in Case of such a War.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="242"/><HI>On the Roman Catholick Side,</HI></P>
<P>There would be the Emperor, the Pope, the King of <HI>France,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> Five Electoral Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Catholick Cantons of <HI>Swisserland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the Protestant Side,</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>England,</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Czar of <HI>Moscovy,</HI> States of <HI>Holland,</HI> Three Electoral Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> but those by far the Strongest; the Protestant Cantons of <HI>Swisserland,</HI> the <HI>Grisons, Hungarians, Transilvanians,</HI> and <HI>Moldaviaens.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place, I think it wou'd easily be granted, That the <HI>English, Dutch, Dane,</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI> United; wou'd be able to Maintain so absolute a Dominion of the Seas, as would entirely Ruin the Negotiation of the Catholick Party, Beggar their Merchants, Starve their Islands, and Destroy all their Trade: They should never be able to Build a Ship without Leave; their Ports should be Bombarded and Destroy'd, their Open Country be Ruin'd by Descents, and all their Coasts continually Harrass'd and Alarm'd by Fleets, and Volant Parties.</P>
<P>What the Armies at Land could do, I referr to the History of the Present War, and of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> who, barely on a War of Religion, and with only his Own single Force, and the Prote∣stant Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> who were then much Wea∣ker than they are now, in Two Years and a half pass'd the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Danube,</HI> and shook the Imperial Crown on the Head of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>It would take up too much room in this short Trea∣tise, to Consider the Proportion of the Force of these
<PB N="246" REF="243"/>
Nations in general; 'tis true that the weight of the Force of the Catholick Party, lies in the Power of the <HI>French;</HI> who must, in such a Case, be the Bulwark and Support of their Cause.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he wou'd as he has in all Cases have Work enough to <HI>Secure his Own;</HI> the Empires se∣parated from the Protestant Party, with the <HI>Swede, Dane, Brandenburghers, Saxons,</HI> and all the Prince of the <HI>Augustane</HI> Confession on its Front, with the Pro∣testants of <HI>Ʋpper Hungaria</HI> and <HI>Transilvania</HI> in the Rear, with the <HI>Switz</HI> and <HI>Grisons</HI> in the Flank, wou'd be very hard bestead, having no Power but the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and the small Electorates of <HI>Ments, Triers</HI> and <HI>Cologne,</HI> which are of no Consideration to uphold it. Some Support might be drawn from <HI>Italy</HI> indeed; but the <HI>French</HI> must give a powerful Assistance, or the Emperor would be Devoured in two Campaigns, the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Eastern Germans,</HI> as the <HI>Lunenburghers</HI> of <HI>Hannover</HI> and <HI>Brunswick,</HI> would be the Opposites to the <HI>French</HI> on this side, and there the Contention would be strongest.</P>
<P>I believe no Wise Man wishes for so Universal a Distraction as such a War would make in <HI>Europe,</HI> but 'tis needful to suppose such a Thing, in order to Exa∣mine whether we ought to apprehend any Danger from it, in case such an Attempt shou'd ever be made in <HI>Europe;</HI> for 'tis apparent, some Princes of the Ro∣man Catholick Party, have Will enough to such an Enterprize, and the Pope would be forward enough to set it on Foot, if he were but sure of the Success.</P>
<P>The glorious Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> in which all the World must acknowledge the <HI>French</HI> have been very much reduc'd, has but One Clause that any way Eclip∣ses the Honour of its Conclusion on the Protestant side, and that is, that it left the Poor Protestant Sub∣jects of the King of <HI>France,</HI> without any shelter from the Violences of their Persecutors; as if the
<PB N="247" REF="244"/>
Protestant Princes had so much excluded the Int'rests of Religion from the Articles, that they had not one Compassionate Thought for their Distressed persecu∣ted Brethren. 'Tis true, the War was wholly <HI>a War of State,</HI> as is before noted, and the Invasion of Pro∣perty was the Occasion of it; and therefore the Sur∣render of <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who is a Roman Catholick, nay, a few Villages in the <HI>Chattelany</HI> of <HI>Aeth,</HI> made more Bustle in the Treaty, than the Restoration of Three Hundred Thousand banish'd Christians to their Country and Estates.</P>
<P>Some have presum'd to say, That had the Restora∣tion of the Edict of <HI>Nants</HI> been insisted on with the same Vigour as the Dutchy of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> it wou'd as easi∣ly have been obtain'd; and these People, among whom some of the <HI>French</HI> Refugees are of that Mind, think the Protestant Int'rest was not so much Considered in that Treaty as it ought to have been. I cou'd easily Answer such Objectors, by telling them, That the Ground of this War being only Matter of Right, to reduce the Power of <HI>France</HI> to a Balance, and to oblige her to restore what she had by Force and Injustice ta∣ken from her Neighbours; this being obtain'd, the End was answer'd, and the Confederate Princes had no farther Pretence for a War: As to the Protestant Refugees, they were the Subjects of the King of <HI>France,</HI> and strictly speaking with respect of Princes, no body had any thing to do with it, let him use them how he would.</P>
<P>Besides, to have made it an Article of the Peace, it could not be expected that the Catholick Branches of the Confederacy would have insisted on it, or, indeed, have desired it, and the Treaty being Manag'd in one Body, by the Resolutions and Measures of several Princes and States in Congress, the Catholick Princes would have immediately protested against it, and the Union must have been Dissolved.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="245"/>
So that there was no room to Espouse the Interests of the Protestant Subjects of <HI>France</HI> in the General Treaty, any other Way than by Intercession with their King to use them Mercifully: And this has been done by all Parties, tho' hitherto without Success.</P>
<P>It remains now to examine what Methods are fur∣ther to be used, in order to oblige the King of <HI>France</HI> to use his Protestant Subjects with more Humanity, and if possible, either to preserve them that Peace and Enjoyment of their Properties and Estates, which is their Natural Right; or to procure them some other Equivalent which may give them some kind of Satis∣faction and Repose.</P>
<P>To Commence a War against the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the Prosecution of His Protestant Subjects, seems to be very Unjust; because Speaking of Right and Wrong, we are not Interested in the Quarrel. I make no Question but the Protestants of <HI>France</HI> themselves have, by the Laws of Nature and Reason, a right to Defend their own Possessions and Inheritances, and to Maintain themselves in them by Force, if they had a Power; and by the same Rule might by Strength of Hand recover and take Possession of their own Rights, be they never so Just. Only thus far 'tis plain, That by the particular Article of the Peace of <HI>Reswick,</HI> re∣specting the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France; England</HI> is fore-closed from such an Attempt, both Sides having expresly Stipulated not to Assist the Subjects of either against their Soveraign. The Fourth Article of the said Treaty, ptoviding as follows, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P><HI>And since the most Christian King was never more desi∣rous of any thing, than that the Peace be Firm and Inviola∣ble, the said King Promises and Agrees for Himself and His Successors, That he will on no Account whatsoever di∣sturb the said King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>in the free Possession of the Kingdoms, Countries, Lands or Dominions which He now Enjoys, and therefore Engages His Honour, upon</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="246"/>
<HI>the Faith, and Word of a King, that He will not give or Afford any Assistance, directly or indirectly, to any Ene∣my or Enemies of the said King of</HI> Great Britain; <HI>and that He will in no manner whatsoever favour the Conspi∣racies or Plots which any Rebels, or ill-disposed Persons, may in any Place Excite or Contrive against the said King; and for that End Promises and Engages, That He will not Assist with Arms, Ammunition, Provisions, Ships, or Money, or in any other way, by Sea or Land, any Person or Persons, who shall hereafter, under any Pretence what∣soever, Disturb or Molest the said King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>in the free and full Possession of His Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions. The King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>like∣wise Promises and Engages for Himself and Successors, Kings of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>That He will Inviolably Do and Perform the same towards the said most Christian King, His Kingdoms, Countries, Lands and Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>There seems to be but one way left, either to make any amends to these poor desolate People, or to bring to pass their Re-admission; I do not say, that the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> will find it their Interest to put it in practice any more than I believe it is really the In∣t'rest of the King of <HI>France,</HI> to Ruine so many Thou∣sand Families of his Peaceable Subjects; I mean, <HI>the Old Standard Law of Retaliation.</HI> But if it might be a Means to re-establish those poor People in Peace and Liberty, the Sacrificing Ten Thousand Families of o∣ther Persons, as Innocent as them, seems to be a Justice their present Case calls for.</P>
<P><HI>Lex Talionis</HI> seems to me to be the Foundation-Law of Right and Wrong; the Scripture is full of Instan∣ces of this Nature: <HI>Adoni-bezek, Agag,</HI> declare it to be agreeable to the Divine Method of Executive Justice; the reason of Rewards and Punishments, seems to be wholly measured by it; and if exactly administred, it carries so convictive a Force, that no Person who ever fell under the severest part of it, could object against
<PB N="250" REF="247"/>
the Execution of it. <HI>Adoni-bezek,</HI> above-mentioned, made a Confession of the Justice of his Punishment, when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off, as a Retaliation of his Barbarities. <HI>Judg.</HI> 1. 7. And <HI>Sa∣muels</HI> Return upon <HI>Agag,</HI> That <HI>as his Sword had made Women Childless, so should his Mother be Childless among Women;</HI> declares both the Reason and the Justice of Gods Decree against him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xv. 33.</P>
<P>'Tis true, this Retaliation is strictly Personal; and all Retaliation ought to be so, if possible: But in some Cases it differs; and where a Personal Retaliation is not practicable, then People are considered in Colle∣ctive Bodies, Nations, Families, and States. Thus, in a War, the Subjects of either Party account is very ju∣stifiable, to make themselves satisfaction for Injuries received, on any of the Subjects of the contrary Party, tho' the Wrong particularly suffered, is not chargeable on those particular Persons who suffer for it.</P>
<P>By the same Rule, it seems justifiable, if we cast the whole Body of <HI>Europe</HI> into Two sorts, <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Pro∣testant,</HI> that while the one part commit Hostilities and Depredations on the other, the injur'd Party should have a Right of Retaliation on any Member of the same Body, of what Nation or Government soever they shall be, where the Power is properly put into their Hands: for Power, in such a case, may pass for a sufficient Right of Directing the said punishment, since nothing but want of <HI>Power</HI> interrupts its being <HI>Per∣sonal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King has given a Challenge to all the <HI>Protestant Princes</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> in his present Usage of the Reformed Churches of <HI>France:</HI> He has carry'd on, tho' not with much Success, a War for above Eight Years, against the whole United power of <HI>Europe;</HI> at last he has made a <HI>Peace,</HI> not at all to his Advantage, nor much for his Honour: And now the War of State is at an end, he seems to be beginning a War of Religi∣on,
<PB N="251" REF="248"/>
and that he may lay the Foundation of it safely, he has began it upon his own Subjects.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine why all the <HI>Protestant Princes</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI> should not think themselves concern'd in this Invasion of their Religion, since nothing is more cer∣tain than that they are all strook at, tho' more remote¦ly: And by all the Rules of Human Policy, prevention ought to extend as far as the Evil is design'd.</P>
<P>If the weakening the <HI>Protestant Interest</HI> in general, were only the Design; the strengthening that Interest ought to be the care of the other: Besides, the <HI>Papists</HI> are the Aggressors, as they always have been, and the Injustice of their Cause so great, that they have hardly ever attempted to make any other pretences for all their Barbarities, than the Absolute <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Pleasure</HI> of their <HI>Omnipotent Monarch,</HI> who <HI>will have but one Reli∣gion within his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>I confess, to me it seems very proper, for the Ease of all <HI>Parties,</HI> That Religion should really divide the whole Body of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that all the Roman Catho∣licks, and all the <HI>Protestants,</HI> if they could but agree it among themselves, should live by themselves: That if the <HI>French</HI> King will have no <HI>Protestants</HI> in his Domi∣nion, the <HI>Protestants</HI> should suffer no Roman Catholicks in theirs; and when all <HI>Parties</HI> are withdrawn to their own sort, and the Division compleated, let the Ro∣man Catholicks begin a War of Religion as soon as they please.</P>
<P>It is, in my Opinion, the unjustest thing in the World, that since the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> suffer no <HI>Protestants</HI> to live amongst them, but the Bloody <HI>In∣quisition</HI> destroys them, and the <HI>French</HI> have Dragoon'd Three Hundred Thousand of their <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects to <HI>Mass,</HI> and hurry'd Three Hundred Thousand more out of their Country, to seek Comfort from the Cha∣rity of Neighbour States. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> has Exil'd all his <HI>Protestant Vaudois:</HI> And hardly any <HI>Po∣pish</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="249"/>
Country admit the <HI>Protestants</HI> among them, some few parts of <HI>Germany</HI> excepted, yet the Protestant-Governments, at the same time, suffer Three Milli∣ons of Papists to live among them, and enjoy their Li∣berties and Estates unmolested.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, the Protestants of <HI>France, Savoy,</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> have been persecuted, under the Assurances of the most solemn Treaties, the most sacred Edicts, and the firmest Peace that could be made; they have never (their Enemies themselves being Judges) been guilty of the Breach of their Faith or Loyalty. <HI>Henry</HI> III. of <HI>France,</HI> acknowledged it, when he had recourse to them for Protection against his own mutinous Ca∣tholick Subjects. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> acknowledged it, in his Speech to those <HI>Vaudois</HI> whom he had Relea∣sed out of the Citadel of <HI>Turin.</HI> We never read of any War begun by the Protestants, they were always Defendants: We have not one Instance of a Massacre committed, or a King Assassinated, or of Nobles Un∣dermined, in order to be blown up by them; they have always been Men of Peace, till Self-Defence has oblig'd them to be Men of War. On the contrary, the Roman-Catholicks have been always uneasie to the Governments they have lived under. Our Histories are full of their Treasons. <HI>Ireland</HI> has twice been Delu∣ged in Blood by their Rebellions and Cruelties. Two Kings of <HI>France</HI> have been Murthered by their Assassi∣nations, and innumerable Protestants Massacred and Butcher'd in cold Blood, under the pretences of Friend∣ship, and assurance of a Treaty.</P>
<P>The Reigns of all our Kings and Queens in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> since <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. have been strangely disturb'd by the Plots, the Treasons and Rebellions of the Pa∣pists; they have often forfeited their Estates and Li∣berties to the Publick Justice of the Nation, had they been dealt with by the Rules of strict Retaliation.
<PB N="253" REF="250"/>
<HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> have such Reasons for Entire removing them out of their Dominions, as no Nation in the World can have greater; and yet here they live in Peace, under the protection of those ve∣ry Princes they refuse to swear Allegiance to, and un∣der the shelter of those Laws they refuse to be bound by. 'Tis no Plea in Bar of any Right, that the <HI>Plain∣tiff</HI> is a <HI>Papist;</HI> our Courts of Justice are as open to them, as to any of the Kings most faithful Subjects: Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Protestants of <HI>France,</HI> tho charg'd with no Disloyalty, nor guilty of no Crimes are Dispossess'd of their Estates, Banish'd their Native Country, Dragoon'd, Shipt to the Gallies, and many of them Hang'd, their Children torn from them by Violence, and buried alive in Monasteries and Nun∣neries, and all the Cruelties an unbridled Soldiery can inflict, acted upon them, without any manner of Crime alledg'd but their Religion, and this when that very Religion was secur'd to them by the solemnest Leagues and Treaties in the World, Declared in the famous Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> Entred, Receiv'd and Registred in all the Parliaments of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> in persecuting his <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects, acts not only the part of a Tyrant over them, as they are his Subjects, but is guilty of the Breach of the Faith and Honour of a King, oppressing those <HI>Peo∣ple</HI> who had their Religion tolerated and allow'd to them by his Ancestors, in the most sacred manner possible; and he is also guilty of the greatest Unkind∣ness to those very <HI>People</HI> who were the Instruments and Agents of the Glory of his Family, and of his Person.</P>
<P>To make good which Reflection, that I may not seem to be guilty of Disrespect to the Majesty of the King of <HI>France,</HI> 'tis needful to examine a little the
<PB N="254" REF="251"/>
Ground on which the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest in <HI>France</HI> stood for the last Century of Years, and the History of the present Royal Family of <HI>France,</HI> and how they came to the Crown.</P>
<P>In the Year 1571. on the 24th. Day of <HI>August, Charles</HI> IX. being King of <HI>France,</HI> the Third War with the <HI>Hugonots</HI> having been lately ended, and a Peace made with the Protestants, the Cities of <HI>Rochel, Montauban, Coignac,</HI> and <HI>la Charitie,</HI> being put into their Hands for Security, and the Chief of the Protestants wholly resting on the Faith and Honour of the King, in full Satisfaction of his sincere Intenti∣ons, being come to Court, was acted the Massacre of <HI>Paris;</HI> at which, in the space of Five Days, above Thirty Thousand Protestants were barbarously Sur∣prized and Butcher'd in Cold Blood.</P>
<P>Upon which follow'd the Fourth and Fifth Civil War; during which, King <HI>Charles</HI> IX. died; and the Crown fell to <HI>Henry</HI> III. the last of the House of <HI>Valois,</HI> and then newly Elected King of <HI>Poland.</HI> The Beginning of his Reign being entangled with Civil Broils, the <HI>Protestant</HI> Interest grew very strong; and tho' the League forced the King to make Three se∣veral Wars with them, yet they still maintain'd their Liberty and Religion.</P>
<P>At length the Faction of the <HI>Guises,</HI> known by the Name of the <HI>Catholick League,</HI> Declar'd themselves so absolutely against the King, and grew so powerful, es∣pecially after the Death of the Duke and Cardinal of <HI>Guise,</HI> whom the King had caused to be kill'd, that they had almost driven him out of the Kingdom. In this Exigence, the <HI>Protestants,</HI> against whom they had carry'd on Four Persecutions and Wars, and therein destroyed many thousands of their Brethren, under∣took his Defence, and joining all their Forces, in or∣der to Restore him, marched with him to the very Gates of <HI>Paris;</HI> where, while he was preparing for a
<PB N="255" REF="252"/>
general Attack of the City, he was barbarously Assas∣sinated by <HI>Jacques Clement,</HI> a <HI>Jacobin</HI> Monk, sent out of the City on purpose, being stabb'd in the Belly with a Poynard, of which he died the Day after.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> IV. the present King's Grand-father, was then King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> and a <HI>Protestant;</HI> and being Lawful Heir to the Crown, as also recommended to the Nobility by the deceased King, at his death, took upon him the Stile and Title of <HI>King of France.</HI> The <HI>League,</HI> back'd by the Power of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> op∣pos'd him with all the vigour imaginable; and many of the Catholick Nobility deserted him, on the Ac∣count of his being an Heretick.</P>
<P>The <HI>Protestants</HI> serv'd him with all the Glory and Loyalty that ever was shown, perhaps, in any War in the World; and, as is computed, during the Years War he maintain'd against the <HI>League,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> Power, above an Hundred and Sixty Thousand Protestant Soldiers lost their Lives in his Service. At length, to put an end to the War, and assure himself of the Kingdom, he deserted his Religion, and turn'd Roman-Catholick; by which means he obtain'd a full Possession of the Crown, ruin'd the League, the Chief Heads of it making their Peace with him, one by one; and at last concluded the War with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> at the Peace of <HI>Vervin.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Protestants,</HI> however, never withdrew their Loyalty nor their Services from him: The famous Mareschal <HI>de Biron,</HI> the Dukes <HI>de Bouillon, du Plessis,</HI> and <HI>de la Tremouille,</HI> continuing to do him the most faithful and important Services against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the last.</P>
<P>Having settled himself in the Kingdom, and made peace with all the World, the <HI>Protestants,</HI> who had serv'd him so faithfully, and who expected no other Reward than the Security of their Religion and Estates, ob∣tain'd from him the famous Edict of <HI>Nantes;</HI> in which
<PB N="256" REF="253"/>
is particularly stated and stipulated, the Terms of their Liberty, in what places they should erect their Tem∣ples, how they should hold their Synods and Assem∣blies: Money was allotted out of the publick Reve∣nues, to maintain their Ministers; Cities were allot∣ted to them, for their Security, the Garrisons where∣of were to be paid by the King: And the Edict was made perpetual and Irrevocable, by being Entred and Registred in the <HI>Parliaments,</HI> and Courts of Justice all over the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But all the Services of the Protestants to this Great King, by which he was brought to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> nor the solemn Engagement of this Edict, could not preserve them, but that in the Ministry of Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> under the very next Reign, they were again attack'd, and driven to the necessity of taking Arms in their own Defence: Which Cardinal, after three times making Peace, and breaking it again at his plea∣sure, compleated the Conquest of them, in the Taking of <HI>Rochelle;</HI> the Protestants being miserably deserted by the <HI>English,</HI> and Thirteen Thousand People Starv'd to Death in the Town.</P>
<P>Since this, in the Infancy of the present King, while the Contests between the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> and the Queen-Mother were so hot as to break out into a War, the Protestants, as Subjects only, were not a little in∣strumental to the maintaining him in that very Power, which now he makes use of to their Destruction.</P>
<P>I think this History fully makes good the Assertion that the present Usage of the Protestants is both Per∣fidious and Ungrateful. Perfidious, as being acted while under the Protection of a Sacred League and Solemn Treaty, and Ungrateful as it is exercised on those very People, who with their Lives and Estates, raised the present Fortune of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> to the Greatness it now enjoys.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this Account, be∣cause
<PB N="257" REF="254"/>
from hence it will appear that the Protestants of <HI>France</HI> stand on a different foot from other Subjects of that Monarchy, and that his right of Dealing with them, differs from his Power over the rest of his Sub∣jects, for they are his Subjects by express Stipulations and Agreements, whose Obedience to him has been al∣ways allow'd to be Conditional; they have made Peace and War with their Kings, not as Rebels, but as Persons having a Lawful Right to Plead and to De∣fend, their Kings have given them Cautionary Towns for the Performance of the Treaties made with them; a Thing which in its own Nature implies that they might hold those Towns against him, if he did not perform the Postulata of those Treaties, without the Scandal of Rebellion.</P>
<P>So that their Right to the Liberty of their Religion, had an Authority sufficient to justifie them in taking Arms; nor does any of the <HI>French</HI> Histories, that ever I saw, tho' wrote with the greatest Partiality, ever call it a Rebellion, but a War with the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> and the Conclusions were always call'd, <HI>A Peace with the</HI> Hugo∣nots, as is Evident thro' <HI>D' Avila</HI>'s whole History of the Civil Wars of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The History of the Protestants of the <HI>Ʋpper Hungary</HI> and of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> might in many respects bear a parallel with this, the Persecutions and ill-Usage of them, ha∣ving been after the solemnest Agreement and Treaties with them that could be made; insomuch as that poor Unhappy People being so absolutely separated from any Relief of their Brethren of <HI>Germany,</HI> have been forced to fly for Protection to the Enemies of Christi∣anity, the <HI>Turk,</HI> with whom however they have this Satisfaction, that whatever Bargain they make for their Religion, they are sure they will keep it. And I re∣member very well a Banished <HI>Hungarian</HI> Minister told me, Discoursing of this very Case, <HI>he was sorry to say it, That the Turks, tho' they made them pay Dear for it,</HI>
<PB N="258" REF="255"/>
<HI>were Juster and Truer to their Leagues and Treaties than the Imperialists, who call'd themselves Christians.</HI></P>
<P>It may possibly be objected here, That while we Ex∣claim against the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> for their Vio∣lence to their Subjects, if we should do the same thing to the Papists, it would be Practising what we Condemn and doing Evil that Good may come.</P>
<P>The Answer to this is included in what goes before, <HI>viz.</HI> taking the whole Roman Catholick and Prote∣stant Party in <HI>Europe</HI> asunder, and considering them as two Collective Bodies divided in Interest and Religi∣on, it seems to me to be just that a Retaliation of the Injuries done upon the Members of one Party in one place, may be made upon the Members of the same Party in another place, by the same Rule that De∣predations of the Subjects of one Prince in War, may be paid by Reprizal upon sny of the Subjects of the same Prince.</P>
<P>But this may be more fully answer'd thus, That if the Popish Subjects of some Protestant Governments have so behaved themselves to their Governors, as to make their Extirpation just, that Justice however sus∣pended in Mercy to them hitherto, will absolutely ju∣stifie removing them from those Governments, and by that means <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> be Executed by the Hands of Publick Justice, and one Banishment be at the same time both a Punishment of their several Crimes, and a Retaliation of the Oppressions of their Party. This is a Method God Almighty often takes himself, while he suffers a Punishment for a publick Crime of less Guilt to be the Executor of his Vengeance for some Crime of a higher Nature not known.</P>
<P>To go no farther than <HI>Ireland</HI> for an Instance of this, the present Inhabitants, I mean the Popish <HI>Irish</HI> by a Bloody Massacre of Two Hundred Thousand <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> in 1641. by little less intended, and as much as they were able, executed this late War, have deserved no doubt to have been used at the Discretion of the
<PB N="259" REF="256"/>
<HI>English;</HI> and <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> was more than once con∣sulting to Transplant the whole Nation from that Island. If he had done it, or if it had now been done, I am of the Opinion, no Nation in the World wou'd have Tax'd us with Injustice, and I do verily think <HI>Oliver</HI> Acted with more Generosity than Discretion in omitting it; for this is certain, that if he had done it, this last War and the Expence of so much Treasure as it cost this Nation, and the Ruine of so many Thou∣sand <HI>Protestant</HI> Families, who were driven from thence by King <HI>James,</HI> all the Destruction at <HI>London-Derry,</HI> the Sickness at <HI>Dundalk,</HI> and the Blood of 150000 people, who at least one way or other, on both sides, perish'd in it, had been prevented.</P>
<P>It may be enquired whithere <HI>Oliver</HI> design'd to Transplant them, I could answer directly to that also; but 'tis sufficient to my purpose to say, had he clear'd the Island of them, it had been no matter at all to us whither they had gone, and the King of <HI>France</HI> has set a Rule for such as Banish their Subjects to let them go where they please, and then they certainly separate; whereas had he sent the <HI>Protestants</HI> to any particular place, they wou'd have been so many and so United, they might possibly have come back again with Swords in their Hands, and ha' bidden fair for another <HI>Hugo∣not</HI> War,</P>
<P>I have also seen among the Letters of State written by Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> who was his Secretary for the Foreign Dispatches, a Letter written to the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> wherein by way of Argument to prevail for some Ease to the <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> he proposes a Confe∣deracy with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and all their Reform'd Friends, to reduce the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to a Necessity of giving better Conditions to the <HI>Vaudois;</HI> and seems to Threat∣en to Expel all the Roman Catholicks in <HI>Engiand, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> out of his Dominions. I remem∣ber upon Discoursing of this passage in some Company
<PB N="260" REF="257"/>
one asked, <HI>What if he had?</HI> and another by way of Re∣partee, made Answer, <HI>Then there wou'd have been none left.</HI> I repeat it not for any great Wit in the Answer but to Introduce the Question,</P>
<P>What if he had?</P>
<P N="1">1. If he had, possibly we had not been troubled with any <HI>Popish Plot</HI> in 1678. nor none of the Bloody Consequences of it; we had had no <HI>Sham-Plot</HI> upon that, no <HI>Russel, Sidney,</HI> nor <HI>Armstrong</HI> Murthered; no Blood lost in an Invasion by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> nor Cruel Executions in the West; we had had no <HI>Po∣pish</HI> Successor, no Standing Army, no Bishops sent to the <HI>Tower,</HI> no Invasion of Charters nor Priviledge of Universities; no Ecclesiastical Commission, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We had had no Nuncio from <HI>Rome,</HI> to take his Progress over the Kingdom, no Fire-Works for a Sham-Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> nor no Mass Sung in <HI>Windsor</HI> Chappel, no Seminaries or Priests, nor Nunneries of Whores, at <HI>Chelsea, Lincoln-Inn Fields,</HI> or <HI>Hammer∣smith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In short, we had had no War of Nine Years to restore a Popish King, the Nation had not spent 60 Millions Sterling, nor lost 200000 of the Stoutest of her Inhabitants to Maintain her Liberty; King <HI>William</HI> had been King in Right of his Wife, and a Peaceable Admission had been given him.</P>
<P>In all probability this had been the Consequence, if <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> had sent them all out of the King∣dom. <HI>I beshrew his Heart he did not.</HI></P>
<P>I do not pretend to lead my Reader to any Politi∣cal Reasons why this shou'd be done now; our Go∣vernours are best Judges of the publick Interest. But thus far, I think, may be assumed without danger of Religion.</P>
<P>If the Nation shou'd think fit in Compassion to the Miseries of our poor Distressed Brethren of <HI>France</HI> to Retaliate their Usage upon the Roman Catholicks of
<PB N="261" REF="258"/>
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the following Consequences would in all probability ensue, which whether it wou'd be just in the whole, or Beneficial to <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> in particular, I leave to the Judgment of Impartial Rea∣ders to Consider.</P>
<P N="1">1. It might be a means, by the Intercession of Par∣ties, to procure some reasonable Conditions for the poor <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> as the Stopping the Mares∣chal <HI>Boufflers</HI> at the Surrender of <HI>Namure</HI> procur'd Justice to the Imprisoned Garrisons of <HI>Deinse</HI> and <HI>Dix∣mude.</HI> This is a Practice too well known in the War to need any Contention, where the putting a Prisoner of War to Death, or any other Breach of Articles has been requited buy putting some other Prisoner of War to Death on the contrary Side; and tho' the latter be an innocent Person, <HI>Lex Talionis</HI> is the Word, the Justice of it is not disputed.</P>
<P N="2">2. It wou'd put these Kingdoms in a Condition to Entertain and Relieve that great Multitude of Distres∣sed Christians, with the very Substance of their Ad∣versaries, and the King of <HI>France</HI> might, if he pleas'd, make the Roman Catholicks Amends, by giving them the Estates of the <HI>Hugonots,</HI> or what other Way he thought fit.</P>
<P>This is most certain, that the Roman Catholicks of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd not have half the Reason to Complain of hard Usage that the <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have, they have no Leagues or Capitulations to show for their Permission; the Laws of the Kingdom are expresly against them, and they have in all Reigns for 150 Years past, been the Disturbers of the Peace of it; they re∣fuse now to Swear Allegiance to the Government, and if they do not Disturb it, it is Owing to their want of Power, not their want of Will.</P>
<P>But if they had all those Defences to make, which have been hinted, on behalf of the <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> they wou'd have no body to thank for such Usage, but
<PB N="262" REF="259"/>
their own Friends. And the Pope, if he ow'd them so much Care, might use his Interest with the King of <HI>France,</HI> to let the <HI>Protestants</HI> enjoy their Liberty, in or∣der to save them from the same Fate.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, object against the receiving such vast Numbers of Foreigners among us, as Prejudicial to the Interest of Trade, and to our own Manufacturers and Inhabitants, by Eating the Bread out of our Months, and Starving our own Poor.</P>
<P>This is an Argument would require a little Volume to Answer; but in General, I presume to Affirm, That no Number of Foreigners can be Prejudicial to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> let it be never so great. Number of Inhabitants, is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom; and if we had a Million of People in <HI>England,</HI> more than we have, let them be of what Nation they would, it would be far from being a Damage to us.</P>
<P>'Tis true, if these Million of People were all Arti∣sans, Manufacturers, it would be some detriment to our Poor who are employ'd in those particular Manufa∣ctures: But allow one third to be Artisans, one third Labourers, Husbandmen or Sailors, and one third Merchants, Shop-keepers or Gentlemen; and if the greatest Number that can be supposed came to settle in <HI>England,</HI> it could be no Injury, but a vast Advantage to the Kingdom in general: And it will appear by this One particular, well examin'd.</P>
<P>An Addition of a Million of People, suppose that were the Number, would devour a proportion'd quan∣tity of Corn and Flesh for Food and Drink, and a pro∣portioned quantity of Manufactures for Cloth and Housholdstuff; the one employs more Land, and the other more People? Now 'tis apparent, we have in <HI>England</HI> more Land lies unimprov'd, common, and waste, than would feed a vast many People more than we have; and we have a Staple of Wooll, never to be exhausted. In Manufactures, the more Lands we im∣prove,
<PB N="263" REF="260"/>
the greater the Rents will be, and the greater the general Stock of the Nation will be; and the more Manufactures are made, the better the Poor are em∣ploy'd, and the Richer the Manufacturer is made.</P>
<P>Many other Arguments might be used, to prove, That the coming Over of Foreigners can be no general prejudice to the Nation, as to Trade. But that is not the main thing here. If the Roman Catholick Princes pursue their <HI>Protestant</HI> Subjects with such Cruelty, and drive them into Banishment and Exile, to seek Relief in Foreign Countries the Case seems to speak for it self, the <HI>Protestants</HI> can have no readier way, either to prevent the Miserics of those poor persecuted People, or to relieve them in their Exile, than by dealing with the <HI>Papists</HI> in their Dominions in the same manner, and Inviting the said persecuted <HI>French</HI> to come and live in the Estates and in the Places of their Adversa∣ries. This is <HI>Lex Talionis:</HI> And this is a way that would soon tire the <HI>Papists</HI> out. For I think I may be allowed to suppose there are much the greater number of <HI>Papists</HI> among the <HI>Protestants,</HI> than there are of <HI>Pro∣testants</HI> among the <HI>Papists;</HI> and the Exile of the Par∣ties would also dister, as to Place. For, generally speaking, the <HI>Protestant</HI> Countries are the best for Strangers to live in, the <HI>Protestant</HI> People are the Tra∣ding People of the World; therefore the Exile of the <HI>Protestants</HI> of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> would be less to their disadvantage, than the <HI>Papists</HI> of <HI>England, Ireland</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> who must apply themselves to Countries where there are few Manufactures, small Trade, and but very indifferent Means for a Stranger to Live. So that the <HI>Popish</HI> Exiles would be in much the worse Circumstances: And there is no question, but when∣ever the <HI>Protestant</HI> Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> shall find it need∣ful to use this Remedy, the Roman-Catholick Powers will find it for their Interest to make some Cartel, or Condition, upon which all their Subjects, tho' they
<PB N="264" REF="261"/>
are <HI>Protestants,</HI> may enjoy some sort of Liberty in their own Native Countries; and so Persecution, as well as War, might end in an an Universal Happy Peace to <HI>Europe,</HI> both in Matters of Religion, as well as Civil Affairs, which has so often been attempted by other Methods, to so little purpose.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>A LETTER to Mr. <HI>HOW,</HI> By Way of REPLY TO HIS CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PREFACE TO AN Enquiry into the Occasional Conformity of DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER such an Account as you have given of your self in the Five first Pages of your Book, with the Aversion you have to any thing which shou'd interrupt you in your more <HI>Recluse</HI> Studies; I presume no Man cou'd imagin you would break tho∣rough your own Measures to attack a <HI>poor Prefacer,</HI> as
<PB N="265" REF="262"/>
you call me, and wholly quitting the Argument, amuse the World, and content your self to Lash the Author with the Severity of your Wit.</P>
<P>Herein, Sir, I must own, that not only your Oppo∣nent, but all the Town seem Disappointed exceeding∣ly, that Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who thinks the Subject not worth Answering, shou'd trouble his Head, or spend his Time about the Impertinence of a <HI>sorry Prefacer.</HI></P>
<P>When I Address'd the Preface to you, I thought I had so carefully Revis'd both it and the Book, that, as I mention'd to you, I cou'd no-where be Tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and Good Manners.</P>
<P>And tho' I wou'd always make them both my Rule, yet I thought my self oblig'd to it more now than or∣dinarily, by how much the person to whom, and the persons of whom I wrote, were equally known and very much valued by me; and I did not question but I shou'd either not be Reply'd to at all, or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a <HI>Christian,</HI> the Civility of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and the Force and Vigour of a <HI>Scholar.</HI></P>
<P>But since it seems good to you, Sir, to descend so far below your self as to quit the Dispute offer'd, and fall upon me personally, and to mix Raillery and Reproach with your Argument, <HI>which, I am sure, you know too well to think betters the Cause:</HI> You must blame your self, Sir, for Obliging me in my own Defence to be a little freer with you than otherwise I shou'd have thought had become me.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, shou'd I have engag'd with you, even in my own Defence, knowing I am to struggle with so unequal a Match both as to your Learning and Repu∣tation, had I not seen your Book differ so much from your constant Character; and pardon me, Sir, for the Word, <HI>in many Places from the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>And since I am oblig'd thus publickly to Animad∣vert upon my Superiors, for such I own you to be both in Learning and Office,</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="263"/>
I shall ask your Leave to lay down several Mistakes upon which I must be allow'd to suppose you have gone in the Censures which you have made; which Suppositions I draw from the whole Tenour of your Writing.</P>
<P>I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken in these Four Points, in the <HI>Person, Temper, Profession,</HI> and <HI>Intention</HI> of the Author,</P>
<P>Which Mistakes, I shall venture to suppose, are the Reasons which moved you to treat your Adversary with so much indecent Contempt.</P>
<P>As to my <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Temper:</HI> 'Tis true, Sir, I have chosen to conceal my Name; and tho' bating Humane Frailty, Sins and Misfortunes, I know no Reason why the Argument should be asham'd of the Author, or the Author of the Argument: Yet when I consider'd how constant a practice it is in the World to Answer an Argument with Recriminations instead of Reasonings, I thought it best to continue retir'd, that the Case I had enter'd upon might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of the Meanness and Imperfections of the Author.</P>
<P>I need not go back to the Instance of our Saviour, whose Arguments were Confronted with the Con∣tempt of that Question, <HI>Is not this the Carpenter's Son?</HI> For I find that even Mr. <HI>How</HI> himself wou'd have search'd my Character to have compleated his Remarks with Personal Reflections.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my Name has to the Argument; it cou'd be only useful to furnish you with something in my Character to Reproach me with; which, <HI>God knows you might have found enough of.</HI></P>
<P>But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand? The Occasional Conformity of Dissenters is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either side, but by Truth, Scripture, and Reason.</P>
<P><HI>Thou was't altogether born in Sin,</HI> says the High-Priest,
<PB N="267" REF="264"/>
and the Elders of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to the Poor Man whom Christ had healed; <HI>and doest thou Teach us?</HI> And yet the poor Man was in the Right; and if I am so, tho' I was the meanest and most scandalous of Scrib∣lers, is my Argument the worse?</P>
<P>But, Sir, to Answer all those Particulars, and let you know that I am not altogether so shy of my Name as you imagine, I shall give you a Genuine honest Ac∣count of my self, and then my Name is at your Service.</P>
<P>First, Sir, I am to tell you, that I am, and acknow∣ledge my self to be, possess'd with a strong Aversion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of Religion; and do think that the Case in hand is be allow'd no less: And therefore wrote the Enquiry with Two very honest Designs, <HI>viz,</HI> To see if by Strength of Argu∣ment I cou'd receive Satisfaction; and to Explode, and, as far as in me lies, to Oppose the Practice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Had your Book given me, or any Body else that I can meet with, <HI>whose Judgment is to be valu∣ed,</HI> the Satisfaction I desir'd; I assure you, I am so little fond of an Opinion, because it is mine, that I shou'd not have been asham'd to have own'd my self mistaken; and possibly have shown as much Humility in Acknowledging it, as you think I have Pride in Opposing.</P>
<P>As to Personal Miscarriages and Misfortunes, of which no Man has more, and which, perhaps may weaken the Reputation of the Author, but I am sure ought not of my Argument: To them I shall only say, God <HI>in his Merciful Providence has heal'd the Last, and, I hope, has Pardon'd the First:</HI> And if so, I am upon even Terms in point of Reasoning.</P>
<P>By this you may see I am sensible of the Beam in my own Eye, and have for some years taken up the part of a Penitent on that very account; but did never un∣derstand that thereby I was barr'd from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to the Profession of a
<PB N="268" REF="265"/>
Party in General, of whom, <HI>though unworthy, I</HI> was a Member.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, am I any-where guilty of Judging another, where the Case is not so plain, as that it really seems to speak it self: For I must remember also, that we are no more to call Good, Evil, or Evil, Good, than we are to Judge one another.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I am gone over my own Character; and shall only demand this from you of Right, That, so far as Truth and Honesty is on my side, it may not, nor ought not to be despis'd for being usher'd in by an un∣worthy instrument.</P>
<P>And 'tis strange, Sir, that you who Animadvert upon me for Judging, should so severely judge me, and that wrongfully too, as shall appear in the Particu∣lars of this short Discourse.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be satisfi'd to say less to this point on these Accounts, because I must put in a <HI>Caveat</HI> against Personal Reflections as unfair in the Dispute: He that pleases first to Confute the Argument, is welcome to show his Wit in Satyrizing upon the Follies and Af∣flictions of the Author: And there I leave it, and proceed to what I conceive is your third Mistake about me.</P>
<P><HI>Viz.</HI> My profession. And this you seem to make plain, while from the 13th, to the 24th page, you treat me as an Independent, and spend your time to Reply to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticular Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in dispute between You and Them: which, with Submission, I conceive to be no∣thing at all to the purpose.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>P</HI> 30, 31, 32, I am talk'd with as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> and <HI>Leveller;</HI> what of these <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI> any where appears in the Enquiry, I confess I am at a loss to know; nor, Sir, have you been so kind to lay it down.</P>
<P>Indeed I own my self somewhat surpriz'd to see you run on in Answering the scrupulous Indepen∣dent
<PB N="269" REF="266"/>
about <HI>Kneeling at the Sacrament,</HI> and the Extra∣vagant <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> about seizing the Proper∣ties of Mankind for the Use of the Saints; and such things as these, by way of Reply to an <HI>Enquiry about Occasional promiscuous Conformity:</HI> and am still at a Loss to find an Antecedent to this Relative.</P>
<P>I assure you I am no <HI>Independent,</HI> nor <HI>Fifth-Monar∣chy-man,</HI> nor <HI>Leveller.</HI> You have shown your Lear∣ning, Sir, and Confuted an Error inconsistent with Civil Society: Very well; but this had been better done by it self; it had no more relation to the Case in hand, than a Lecture against the <HI>Alchoran;</HI> and you may as well conjecture me to be a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> from any thing in the Book that looks like either. But, Sir, since I am led by you to give an account of my profession, which, I hope I shall always be ready to do; I shall do it in few words: That I am of the same Class, and in the same Denomination of a Dissenter with your self, your Of∣fice excepted, and am willing to be guided by, and to practice the Great Rule of Christian Charity in all the proper and legal Extents of it: Indeed I have more need to practice it than you, because I stand more in need of it from others, with respect to the Causes al∣ready nam'd. And however, by wresting Words, and mistaking my Intentions, you are pleased to see nothing of it; I am not yet convinc'd that I have broken that Great Christian Rule of Charity, in any thing I have written.</P>
<P>I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you are mistaken, which is in my <HI>Intentions;</HI> in which you rashly, and, I assure you, wrongfully judge me, how∣ever cautious you wou'd have me be of judging others: But, Sir, <HI>Humanum est Errare;</HI> you are no more In∣fallible, I see, than I, and are fallen into the same rash Error you Reprove me for with so much Severity; by judging, that the principal Design of this Book
<PB N="270" REF="267"/>
was to reflect upon a Worthy Gentlemen, who is nam'd in the <HI>Preface:</HI> And in one place you are plea∣sed to join me with the Party who Oppos'd him, and bring me in making my Court to them.</P>
<P>All these, Sir, I shall make appear to be not only Mistakes, but groundless Mistakes; such as nothing but the same Thoughts which put you out of Tem∣per, cou'd lead you into: And I can solemnly Ap∣peal in the Form you have set down, that you have wrong'd me in your Censure.</P>
<P>First, Sir, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> was publish'd Three years ago, and therefore cou'd not be design'd as a Person∣al Invective against the Gentleman you speak of: All that can be said, is, That the Cause being again given, the Re-printing it was design'd as a Reproof to the Practice: and so much I own. As for <HI>Persons</HI> I am indifferent; <HI>if the Coat fits any Body, let them wear it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, I declare my self, if of any Party, I am, and ever was for the <HI>English</HI> Liberty, and for the putting such Men into Magistracy, who, in Con∣currence with the King, our Supream Magistrate, wou'd protect and preserve that Liberty. And, as a Person every way qualified to execute a Trust of so much Honour, whether profitable or not, I won't examine, I gave my Vote for Sir <HI>Thomas Abney,</HI> and shou'd ha' done so, If I had the power of Ten Thou∣sand Voices; and no Man has more Respect for, or Opinion of his Honesty and Ability than my self: Nor have I, God be thank'd, any Occasion to say this to flatter him; <HI>for I neither want his Favour, nor fear his Anger.</HI></P>
<P>Herein therefore I presume to say you have been entirely mistaken; and these Errors have led you to waste your Time, and the Reader's too, in making needless Remarks, and Answering those People who never Oppos'd you.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="268"/>
I come now to that part of your Book which re∣spects the Case in hand; which, as it is the least part, and indeed seems to agree with the Title, that it is only a <HI>Consideration</HI> of the Preface; <HI>for really with sub∣mission, there is very little Answer to the Fact:</HI> So it re∣quires not that I shou'd Reply to the Argument; for I see none, but that drawing back the Curtain which you have spread over the Subject, I shou'd set it in a True Light, that all Men may judge by their own Consciences, and the Scripture-Rule, and take care they be not distinguish'd out of their Reason and Religion by the Cunning and Artifice of Words.</P>
<P>Please therefore, Sir, to admit me to run over your Book with as modest Animadversions as my just De∣fence will allow; and I am content to stand Correct∣ed, where I fail in point of Decency.</P>
<P>First, You quarrel with me for a <HI>Breach of Kindness and Equity, in hiding my own Name and Revealing yours. Designing my self to fight in the Dark, and expecting you to do it in open Light.</HI> And you give us Five whole Pages, including the Quotation of your self in your Preface to the Inhabitants of <HI>Torrington,</HI> to show your indifferency in Controverted Disputes, and consequent∣ly your Unwillingness to engage in this.</P>
<P>Truly, Sir, as to the First, I thought a publick Ap∣peal to you, who are a publick Person, had been no Sin apainst Kindness or Equity; if it be, I ask your Pardon.</P>
<P>As to my Concealing my Name, I have given you my Reasons already; and as to my Exposing yours, had you thought fit to have Replied to the Book which lay Three years unanswer'd, without being address'd to any person in particular, you had been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as the Author.</P>
<P>But the Enquiry being unanswer'd, gave some peo∣ple more prejudice against the Integrity of Dissen∣ters in general, than I cou'd wish to have found; up∣on
<PB N="272" REF="269"/>
which I thought it necessary to have the Matter discuss'd, if possible; and knew no Man more concern∣ed to do it, <HI>nor more capable than your self.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is your Answering me such a Disappointment as you are pleas'd to mention; but that you shou'd attempt it, and do it to no more purpose, is, I con∣fess, more Disappointment to me than any thing I cou'd ha' met with.</P>
<P>Whether, Sir, the Indifferency you are so pleas'd with in your Temper, be Congruous to your Profes∣sion as a <HI>Gospel Minister, I</HI> shall not examine: Whe∣ther you that are Pastor of a Dissenting Church, and Administer the Ordinances of Christ to a Select Peo∣ple, in a way Dissenting from the Establish'd Church, and thereby maintain a Schism in the said Establish'd Church, ought to be so indifferent as to boast that you never perswaded any Man to Conform, or not to Conform, I leave it to your self to consider; I am sure, if I was arriv'd to that Coldness in the matter my self, I wou'd Conform immediately; for I think what I affirm'd in the <HI>Enquiry</HI> Page remains a Truth unanswer'd by you: <HI>That Schism from a True Establish'd Church of Christ, is a great Sin; and if I can Conform, I ought to Conform.</HI></P>
<P>From this Declaration of your own indifferency to meddle in Matters of Controversie, with your Reasons for it, which I suppose you wou'd have taken as Intro∣ductory to what follows, you are pleas'd to proceed <HI>very angrily</HI> to examine why I engage you in this Quar∣rel: I have given you an Account of it already with all the Honesty and Plainness I can, and I thought a Person in your Place wou'd never have Resented the being put upon the Defence of his Profession, or being Civilly ask'd a Question about it; and I cannot but observe how carefully you avoid being engag'd in the present Dispute.</P>
<P>I ought to have been well assur'd, you say, (1.)
<PB N="273" REF="270"/>
<HI>That you did advise one way or the other;</HI> Or, (2.) <HI>That you ought to have done so.</HI></P>
<P>Really, Sir, I think it immaterial whether you <HI>were,</HI> or on; or, whether you <HI>ought,</HI> or no; for I never Charg'd you with the first, or affirm'd the last; but only ask'd this fair Question:</P>
<P>Whether it was allow'd by Dissenters in general, or by your Congregation in particular? To which Question you give no Answer.</P>
<P>But I shall answer you honestly and directly: I am assur'd, as far as Rationally I can be, by consequences of things, <HI>that you have not advised one way or other?</HI> Nor do I affirm you ought to have done so, unless the Person concern'd, applied to you for Advice in Point of Conscience on the Case; if he did, I do not see how you could decline it. So that to me, it seems, you either were oblig'd, or not oblig'd, as the Application of the Person concern'd might alter the Case: I do not say you were oblig'd officiously to tender your Advice in the Case: <HI>If I am wrong here, I shall acknowledge my Er∣ror when I am better inform'd.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing will come close to the Point, Whe∣ther it be a <HI>Fault,</HI> an <HI>unlawful Action,</HI> or no, for a Dissenter, <HI>as such,</HI> to hold Occasional Communion with the Establish'd Church, and, at the same time continue in, or return to his Relative conjunction with a Sepa∣rate Church?</P>
<P>That it is not a sinful Act simply to have Commu∣nion with the Establish'd Church, I willingly agree. But since on this Point depends the Weight of our pre∣sent Dispute, I must conclude, That I think 'tis a sin∣ful Act circumstantially and conjunctively.</P>
<P>And because I wou'd be rightly understood, I shall endeavour to be Explicit, tho' I run the hazard of being counted impertinent.</P>
<P>I have laid down the Case, I thought, fairly, and of which you are pleas'd to take no Notice, in the <HI>En∣quiry,</HI> Page 12.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="271"/>
<HI>He who Dissents from an Establish'd Church from any other Reasons but such as these; That he really believes the said Establish'd Church is not of the purest Institution, but that be can serve God in a Form more agreeable to his Will; and that accordingly 'tis his Duty to do it so, and no otherwise: Such a one ought to Conform, because to make a Wilful Schism in the Church, is doubtless a great Sin, and if I can avoid it, I ought to avoid it.</HI></P>
<P>If then I am guided by this real Principle of Con∣science to Dissent, how can I Conform without Sin∣ning against that Conscience, by which only my Dis∣senting is made Lawful?</P>
<P>And thus, Sir, I am brought to my Argument again: Of which I shall give you this short Abstract; and you or any body else, are welcome to be angry with me, if you will be pleas'd first to Answer it:</P>
<P><HI>That he who Dissents from the Establish'd Church, ex∣cept from a true Principle of Conscience, is guilty of a great Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who Conforms to the Establish'd Church against his Conscience, is guilty of a great Sin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who both Dissents and Conforms at the same time and in the same Point of Religion, must be guilty of one of these great Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he who has committed either of these Sins, ought not to be receiv'd again on either side on any other Terms than as a Penitent.</HI></P>
<P>I do not examine, as I hinted then, whether the Gentleman you would embroil me with, be thus guil∣ty; <HI>be that to himself.</HI></P>
<P>But I must now come to your Distinctions: Indeed Sir, I believe as you say, that taking which side you will, you may puzzle the most of plain people, who are but of ordinary Understandings in the Contro∣versy about Ceremonies: And give me leave to add, That such is the Subtilty and Nicety of Sophistical Reasonings, that Men may almost Distinguish them∣selves
<PB N="275" REF="272"/>
into, and out of any Opinion; and some Peo∣ple, who are Masters of the Art of Nice Arguing, too often lose both Themselves and their Religion in the Labyrinchs of Words: <HI>School Divinity and Practical Christianity are Two things,</HI> and seldom understood by the same Heads.</P>
<P>But, Sir, with the greatest Respect, and some Concern, let me tell you, I did not think to find all the Difference between the Dissenters and the Church of <HI>England</HI> dwindl'd into <HI>Three additional Appendices, in which we have some Difference, and so:</HI> and this from Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who is Pastor of a Separate Church.</P>
<P>If we differ from them in Trifles, or have but a Trifling Difference, I think we can never justify ma∣king so large a Chasm in the Church; we have much to answer for, without question, in the too fatal Di∣visions of this Nation, if it has all been occasion'd by a few small Appendices.</P>
<P>If our Differences are not Matters of Conscience I have no more to say; if they are, 'tis a Mystery yet hidden from the Common Understandings, how they can be first insisted on from a Principle of Conscience, and then wav'd without acting against that Consci∣ence, which only could justify the first insisting on them: If you can Distinguish us into this, I am mis∣taken.</P>
<P>I allow your Distinctions of Sins, which are Consi∣stent or Inconsistent with the Christian State to be Orthodox and Right.</P>
<P>I allow your Distinctions of Negative and Affirma∣tive Precepts, and, according to my weak Talent, a∣gree with you in them.</P>
<P>But the Consequence you draw, with submission, does not reach the Case; which is, That scrupulous Persons ought to be fully perswaded in their own Minds; and Fellow-Christians were not to Judge, but to Receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="273"/>
This you have answer'd your self, <HI>P.</HI> 13. to be meant in dubious and small Matters: And if we must stick here, we are next to Examine, Whether the Differ∣ence between Us and the Establish'd Church be on∣ly in dubious and small Matters; if it be, I know not how we shall Ward off the Below of being guilty of Schism; the Sin of which I suppose you will not dispute. Wherefore to descend to some Particulars—If I know why we Dissent from the Establish'd Church, 'tis principally on such Accounts as these.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. On account of the Episco∣pal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarkson</HI>'s No Scripture-Evidence for Diocesan Bishops.</NOTE>Hierarchy, Prelatical Or∣dination and Super-intendency.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. On account of their imposing things own'd to be indifferent, as Terms of Communion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. On account of their imposing things own'd to be otherwise indifferent, as made necessary by the Command of the Civil Magistrate.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to Partial Conformity, Dissent in some things, and Conforming in others, which you mention <HI>Page.</HI> <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="oxf"/>. it does not seem to concern this Case. No Man among the Dissenters, I believe, pretended to Dissent in every thing; but we are speaking of Conforming in those very Points in which we Dissent, and that no less than the <HI>Article of Communion.</HI></P>
<P>If these are your small things, I am content to stand by it, and ready to prove, as I said in the <HI>Enquiry:</HI></P>
<P>That whoever Separates from this Church, and at the same time Conforms to it; by Conforming, denies his Dissent being Lawful; or, by his Dissenting, Damns his Conforming as Sinful.</P>
<P>All this, Sir, you have not thought fit to touch upon, for Reasons which you know best; and I really won∣der you shou'd take so much pains to Cavil at me and a simple Preface, which really was not worth your while; and when you have led your self into the Ar∣gument, take no notice of the thing it self, as it is Ob∣jected,
<PB N="277" REF="274"/>
but Distinguish so nicely about the smaller mat∣ters, and omit the greater.</P>
<P>If we differ from the Establish'd Church in small things only, we are to blame to make the Breach so wide. Was it for small and dubious Things only that we suffer'd Process of the Law, Excommunications, Seizures of our Estates, and Imprisonment of our Persons? And since you are pleas'd to bring in that Honourable Gentleman, speaking in the first Person to the Point, as an Inference drawn from your Distincti∣ons, and your self telling us what he may perhaps do;</P>
<P>Give me leave to go through those Supposititions Cases with you, Sir. <HI>As to the particular Person, you concern him in it, not I.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. You say, <HI>He may have Arguments so specious, that supposing he Err, may Impose upon the Judgment, and thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent, Discern∣ing; and Ʋpright-hearted Man, so as to make him think that which is perhaps an Error, his present Duty, and so not offer Violence to his Conscience.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer: Admit he does so; yet while you at the same time allow <HI>he Errs,</HI> that is, Sins; why ought not he to be admonished to Repent of that Sin, before he be receiv'd again into Communion? This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent: You grant (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) a Man is to do the part of a Penitent for a Fault; and this Error is a Fault, though it were an Error of Ig∣norance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then you say, <HI>P.</HI> 18. <HI>As judging such a Church true as to Essentials, he may think (Occasion inviting) he hath greater Reason, though it be Defective in Accidents, to Communicate with it sometimes, than to shun its Commu∣nion always.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, I must say this seems a Sophism in Religion; for allow he may think so, you must allow he ought not to think so. And why <HI>Occasion inviting?</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="275"/>
Why not <HI>Occasion compelling?</HI> 'Tis manifest, For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> cou'd not <HI>compel,</HI> why shou'd <HI>Occasion invite?</HI></P>
<P>I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman; but of Others I can prove, That Force cou'd not <HI>compel</HI> them, but Occasion, that is, Honour and Preferment cou'd <HI>invite</HI> them. Now if you please to Reconcile this for me, I shall be gotten over one Point; Whe∣ther a Man can justify suffering to the Ruin, perhaps of his Family, rather than comply with that which he may do without imposing upon his Conscience, and which, Occasion inviting, he may judge lawful?</P>
<P>You have another Distinction which, I confess, hardly think to be Rational, that is, Unprofitable Pre∣ferment, <HI>Page.</HI> First, I neither understand that the Instance you are upon is Unprofitable, nor believe it; nor that the Epithite can be proper to the word, for that which is unprofitable, cannot be a Preferment.</P>
<P>I must also observe here, Sir, that the Conformity exacted in the late Reigns, was not so large as what these Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with volunta∣rily. Now as to the Ceremonies you insist on, and which indeed I do not, as the way of Administration Kneeling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was allow'd to be so indifferent than, that many receiv'd in the Church Standing. But when these <HI>Unprofitable Preferments,</HI> as you please to call them, invite, they seek of themselves what before they cou'd not be forc'd to.</P>
<P N="3">3. You ask us another Question: <HI>What if some have thought</HI> that <HI>alone a sufficient Reason for their Occasional Communion with a Church, with whom they have not a constant Communion, That they may testify to the World they Decline it not as no Church, but so far practically own it as the Reason of the thing requires; may not be supposed to do this, as thinking it a good Reason, whether it be so or no, without going against Conscience herein?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, Sir, I must suppose these <HI>It may be's,</HI> and <HI>Why may not's,</HI> are put in to make out what you said <HI>Page.</HI> that you cou'd puzzle a mean Understand∣ing
<PB N="279" REF="276"/>
both ways; and, I thank God, you are driven to the Necessity of these Arts. But to let you see these Suppositions may be replied to;</P>
<P N="1">1. Sir, the Church of <HI>England</HI> however, must own Her self very much oblig'd to such Gentlemen who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputation.</P>
<P N="2">2. They may be supposed to do thus, but they can∣not be supposed to do so without a manifest gross ig∣norance, and taking that for a good Reason which is none at all: For if, Sir, you will admit that a Man is in the Right as to himself, while he thinks he is so, then you open the way to the fatal Latitude of all man∣ner of Error; for no Man is guilty of an Error, as an Error, but as his Judgment may be perverted to be∣lieve himself right, when he is wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 19. you are pleas'd to Object for me: <HI>Since, Sir, you think it not unlawful to Communicate with such a Church sometimes, why shou'd you not (for Common Or∣der sake) do it always?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, if you please to give me leave to ask Questi∣ons for my self, I wou'd state it something more fair∣ly to the Case in hand, thus: <HI>Since, Sir, you think it not Unlawful to Communicate with such a Church some∣times, why shou'd you not, to avoid the just Imputation of Schism, which is a great Sin, have done it always?</HI> And why never do it, but when upon an Occasion of Pre∣ferment inviting, you find it necessary to protect you from the penalty of the Law?</P>
<P>I shou'd ha' been very glad you had stated this Question fully, and suppose what Answer you please; for <HI>upon my word,</HI> I <HI>can suppose none,</HI> unless I wou'd bring him in, owning the Crime, and repenting of it; which I shou'd be glad to hear of.</P>
<P>What you say, I shall stare at, Page 20. I <HI>willingly admit, that what is simply best, may not be best for Practice in present Circumstances.</HI> And I must likewise remind you, Sir, That what may be simply Lawful, may be
<PB N="280" REF="277"/>
unlawful <HI>Circumstantially:</HI> And so I affirm this to be and dare undertake to prove it so, without coming in the Number of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fools, with whom you have rank'd me for <HI>proposing hastily beyond Seven Men that can render a Reason.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, <HI>viz.</HI> at your 20th Page, I must leave you to combat with the <HI>Independents</HI> and let them an∣swer for themselves; I am not at all concern'd in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>And you spend three or four <HI>Pages</HI> as an Advocate for the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> concerning Modes and Gestures; in which, I am sure, I am far from placing the least Weight, where serious <HI>Christianity</HI> is to be found; and God forbid either you or I, Sir, shou'd be found making a Rent in the <HI>Christian</HI> Union of this <HI>Church</HI> and Nation, if their Kneeling at the Sa∣crament, or the Use of a Liturgy, were all the Dis∣pute; 'tis you have led me into saying any thing of the Difference between the National <HI>Church</HI> and the Dissenters.</P>
<P>I know that the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Primitive Church included the Forms of their Administrations and Pub∣lick Services; and need not recite my Authorities for it to you, who know it better than <HI>I;</HI> nor that they are found in the Time of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and long before him. But I know also, and the contrary has never been prov'd, that those Forms were not impos'd as Terms of Communion, and under the Penalty of Laws, at least till the Divisions of the Church between the <HI>Arrians</HI> and the Orthodox, when Error and Persecuti∣on got into the Church, and the Evil Spirit Reign'd, to the Destruction of both sides.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I find you no more talking to me till you come to <HI>Page</HI> 25, where you are pleased to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I believe my self capable to Defend my Book against all that the Power of Cavil and Sophi∣stry
<PB N="281" REF="278"/>
can suggest; and therefore I am not sollcitous for my Preface and Title-Page.</P>
<P>But that I may satisfy your Request: and telling you first, that you oblige me to it: I shall be plain.</P>
<P><HI>You desire me to examine my own Heart, what I meant by that Suggestion? in Cases of Preferment, mentioned in the Title; was it not to insinuate, that Preferment was the inducement to that Worthy Person to act against his Conscience?</HI></P>
<P>Sir, Will you be pleased to <HI>Examine your own Rea∣son,</HI> how that can be, when the Words were printed Three Years before the Fact; and I Appeal to God and the World, whether you have not wrongfully Judg'd me then. But to make it more plain:</P>
<P>I do not say he, or any Body else does it for Prefer∣ment; <HI>you are pleas'd strangely to mistake me:</HI> I say they may have the Preferment without it.</P>
<P>'Tis done to save their Money, to save the Five hun∣dred Pounds, which is the Penalty of the Act: I am sorry you have not Read the Book before you ventur'd to make so severe a Remark. For your better Infor∣mation, therefore, Sir, I refer you to <HI>p.</HI> 19. in the <HI>En∣quiry,</HI> where my Words are plain.</P>
<P>As to the Worthy Gentleman, <HI>whose Cause you would have this to be;</HI> you say this has been his known Judg∣ment and Practice several Years.</P>
<P>Tho' it were true, yet, Sir, this is no Argument to prove the thing lawful, or to prove that it is not pra∣ctised, even in every part that I have laid down, by others before him, and like to be so after him; it only quits him of doing it against his Conscience, to q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ellsie himself for the unprofitable Preferment you mention: <HI>and this I never Charg'd him with.</HI></P>
<P>That he had done the Fact, no Body Disputes, but that he did it against his Conscience, I never alledg'd; <HI>you put that upon me, Sir, unjustly:</HI> Be his Conscience to God and himself, I know better than to judge him,
<PB N="282" REF="279"/>
nor can you without a Breach of Charity suggest it of me.</P>
<P>Nor do I any-where say that others have acted a∣gainst their Consciences that do so; possibly they may by the help of <HI>nice Distinguishing,</HI> Reason themselves into a Belief of their being in the Right.</P>
<P>But the Point in Debate is, Whether <HI>whatever their Opinions may be in the Case,</HI> the Act it self be not, as I have said, Circumstantially sinful: For I hope you will grant me they are never the more in the Right for its being their Opinion: Truth is always unmov'd, sullen, and the same, whatever Gloss our Fancy or In∣terest puts upon it.</P>
<P>But since you will have it be this Gentlemans pra∣ctice, which I think no Reputation to him, nor De∣fence of the Practice: Nor do I think you or he can justifie your Dissenting from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and that Practice together: Since, I say, you will have it be that Gentleman's practice; all you gain by that in point of Argument, is, That he did not do it a∣gainst his Conscience, nor to serve the present Turn. And what then? I affirm to you, I neither meant him nor any Man else, but him that is Guilty; and I meant him, and every Body else, if they are guilty. And what is all this to the purpose? The Question is not here, Who is, or is not guilty of it; but whether the thing in its own Nature, aggravated with the Circum∣stances of Turn and Return, timed for Preferment, with all the black <HI>Et cetera</HI>'s of it, as 'tis lately pra∣ctic'd, and as I have laid it down, be a Crime, or no?</P>
<P>If this Gentleman you <HI>would Embroil me with,</HI> did formerly live in a general, or ordinary Communion, both with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and a private Con∣gregation, before eit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> the Preferments, I mention, invited, or the Penalty of the Law forced him to it; Then he stands clear of this part of the Charge, that he did it for the protection of his Interest; but still the Matter of Fact is true.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="280"/>
Thus, Sir, I have said what I thought my self ob∣lig'd to by way of Reply to your Considerations: And as to your Censures, tho' I have a great Opinion of your Charity, however you seem to be out of Tem∣per in this Case; yet I appeal from your Judgment, to the Judgment of Truth; and waving all your puzzling Distinctions, which my Respect for your Person and Character, will not permit me to Descant upon; give me leave to make this short Conclusion.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Christian; the Native Lustre of an honest Heart is impossible to be hid; 'twill shine through all his Life in one Action or ano∣ther in spite of Scandal; and it wants no Artifice to set it out.</P>
<P>If the Practice we Discourse of be to be Defended, <HI>let it be a Practice;</HI> I mean, let it be Voluntary, let it be Free and Spontaneous; and if Gentlemen, who have such a Latitude in their Opinions, wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by their <HI>Interests,</HI> let them practice it openly, and not Time it so to the very <HI>Eve</HI> of an Election, as to have it speak of it self, and, as it were, force Men to believe it done on pur∣pose; nay, let them not put such a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies, as to have it spoken in Con∣tempt, with <HI>Circumstances</HI> that stop the Mouths of Ar∣gument, and are as <HI>Convincing</HI> as Demonstration.</P>
<P>You have given your Blessing to them at the <HI>Conclu∣sion</HI> of your Book, with a <HI>Let them go on and prosper.</HI> I wish you have not spoken Peace where there is no Peace: As to its being a <HI>Secret between God and Them;</HI> I shall only say, <HI>Enter not into their Secret, O my Soul!</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Arcana</HI> that is hidden from my Eyes, and I doubt very much how it can consist with consulting the Rule with the serious Diligence you recommend: For cer∣tainly were the great <HI>Christian</HI> Rule consulted, it wou'd instruct them, that the Profession of the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> Religion is not a thing, the Forms whereof are
<PB N="284" REF="281"/>
of such indifference, as you seem to make it; that 'tis not a light thing to shift and change <HI>Communion</HI> with an Establish'd, and with a Separate <HI>Church,</HI> as often as Convenience, or Reason of State, or Interest invite.</P>
<P>And whether I set my Name to this, or no? Whe∣ther I am an <HI>Independent? I hope they are Christians too as well as other folks.</HI> Whether I am a <HI>Fifth-Monar∣chy-man?</HI> Whether the Book was design'd against my Lord Mayor, <HI>tho' 'twas wrote Three Years before he was Chosen?</HI> Or, whether any thing else you Censoriously charge me with be true, or no, seems to me not worth your while to Examine? Since if I shou'd grant them all, the Argument of Occasional Conformity remains untouch'd.</P>
<P>If the Truth be made the worse for my Temper, I am sorry for it: But this is another of Mr. <HI>How</HI>'s Paradoxes, <HI>and something like your Ʋnprofitable Prefer∣ment,</HI> that Truth, tho' it be mix'd with the worst Temper in the World, shou'd thereby be so debased as to become worse than Error.</P>
<P>Sir, I had ended here, but for a Clause you force me to Reply to, concerning the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> who you tax me with abusing: Indeed 'twas as remote from my Thoughts, as 'twas, that ever it was possible you cou'd treat an Adversary with such Language.</P>
<P>And, but that I shall not suffer my self to be trans∣ported beyond the Bounds of Civility, and so fall into your Error, I cou'd allow my self to be very much mov'd, That such a Man as you should venture to Charge me with what is neither true in Fact, nor can be suggested by Consequence from any thing I have wrote: And, Sir, you must give me leave to say, I am sorry you shou'd lay your self so open, and force me to so severe a Remark.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to affirm, That I industriously re∣present the Primitive <HI>English</HI> Puritans, as if they were generally of my <HI>stingy, narrow</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="282"/>
And here you run upon me with ill Language, <HI>How I could think to Impose upon the World in a matter of so re∣cent Memory;</HI> and, <HI>How I could have the Confidence,</HI> &amp;c. This is really a new sort of Stile from Mr. <HI>How.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, I have industriously examin'd the Book I wrote; and, as I am sure I never entertain'd a Thought in prejudice of the best Character that can be given those Primitive Reformers; so I cannot find one Word in the whole Book which can, no, not with the help of an <HI>Innuendo,</HI> be so much as pretended to look that way.</P>
<P>Wherefore Sir, unless you can make it out, or, by the help of some of your Distinctions, come off from it; I hope you will do me so much Justice, as you are a Man of Truth and Honesty, to recant the Scandal, and acknowledge your self mistaken.</P>
<P>And that I may leave it to every body to Judge, whether I have not just Ground for what I say; I shall quote here all that I have said relating to the <HI>Puritans,</HI> and impartially lay down the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>After I had given a short Abridgment of our Re∣formation, and recited the Controversie between Bi∣shop <HI>Ridley</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hooper,</HI> I proceeded thus, Page the 6th. <HI>When Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>Restored the Protestant Religion, and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the first Establishment of King</HI> Edward, <HI>ob∣tained so on the Minds of Men, that the farther Reformation was rejected: The other Party being not at all Convinc'd, tho' Over-rul'd, submitted their Persons to the Laws, but not their Opinions; affirming, That it was the Duty of every Christian to endeavour to serve God with the greatest Purity of Worship as was possible; and that this was the purest Worship which came nearest the Divine Institution, which they believed the Establish'd Liturgy did not; and therefore in Conscience they must be Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>Having made this Quotation, which I have suffici∣ent Authority to prove genuine, from a Manuscript of a famous Man in those days, which I have seen, and
<PB N="286" REF="283"/>
on occasion am ready to produce: I go on thus:</P>
<P><HI>It must be own'd, that the Original Authors of these Disputes were Learned, Devout, and Singularly Pious, strict in Conversation to Excess,</HI> if that were possible; <HI>and from thence in a sort of happy Derision, were call'd</HI> Puritans: <HI>Of whom I shall say nothing, but leave for a Record the last Speech of a famous Foreigner;</HI><Q>Sit anima mea cum Puritanis Anglicanis.</Q></P>
<P>This is all the Words that have the least Retrospect on the <HI>Puritans,</HI> unless you will pretend that a few words, <HI>Page</HI> 24. is meant of them, which no Man can have any Colour of Reason for: But lest that shou'd be pretended, I shall quote them also, <HI>Page</HI> 24.</P>
<P><HI>The Dissenters can never pretend to be Dissenters upon the meer Principle of Purity of Worship, as I have related in the beginning of this Discourse, if such shall be receiv'd as blameless into their Communion, who have Deserted them upon occasion of Preferment.</HI></P>
<P>This refers back to <HI>Page</HI> 12. where, I say, I shall give my Essay as to what I understand a real Dissenting Protestant is, nor can it refer to any other place: But <HI>if you shou'd still say</HI> it looks back to the <HI>Puritans,</HI> 'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine to find out a Reflecti∣on on them in it.</P>
<P>But this is not the only thing in which you are plea∣sed to injure both me and the Truth: For, <HI>Page</HI> 28. you tell me with some Heat too, <HI>That throughout my Book, such as are so stingily</HI> (your Favourite word, Sir) <HI>bigotted to a Party,</HI> as I, are treated with this sort of Charity, to be stil'd <HI>Painted Hypocrites, such as play Bo∣peep with God Almighty, That if such an Occasion offer it self to any of them to serve God and their Country in a publick Station, do what the Law requires, and which they may sin∣lesly do in order to it, do trespass upon their Consciences, and D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> their Souls to save their Countries.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="284"/>
Sir, <HI>for God-sake,</HI> how came you to let your Passion thus out-run your Memory?</P>
<P>There is not one word of all this true: <HI>Pardon me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to say so: I</HI> refer you to the Criginal to convince your self of it, and I'll take the pains to go along with you in the Examination.</P>
<P>First, As to <HI>Painted Hypocrites,</HI> 'tis spoken of the whole Body of Protestants in <HI>England, in haec Verba.</HI></P>
<P>P. 8. <HI>I must acknowledge it fares with the Chsrch of</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>and with Dissenters both, as it has always far'd with Christs Church in the whole World; that while suppress'd and persecuted, their Professors were few, and their Profession more severe: But when Religion comes to be the Mode of a Country,</HI> so many Painted Hypocrites, there's the Word, <HI>get into the Church, that Guile is not to be seen till it arrive to Apostacy.</HI></P>
<P>Pray, Sir, who can these <HI>Painted Hypocrites</HI> refer to, that you should say, <HI>Innuendo, All those that are not of my Party, or that are not so stingy as I?</HI></P>
<P>These painted Hypocrites must belong to that Re∣ligion which is the Mode of the Country: which must rather mean the Church of <HI>England</HI> than the Dissen∣ters: and yet if I meant either of them, it cannot be made a Reflection, because 'tis confin'd only to such as are Apostates from Religion, not such as continue to Conform to both or either of them.</P>
<P>This is Judging me indeed neither with <HI>Charity</HI> nor Truth: The next Words are, <HI>Such as play Bo-peep with God Almighty.</HI> Pray, good Sir, reflect on <HI>Solomon,</HI> and what is said of such as judge of a Matter before they hear it: I am perswaded you did not read the Clause; which is thus:</P>
<P>I had been Examining the Woful Excuse of some people, and <HI>too many such we had,</HI> who wou'd take the Sacrament at the Church, and pretend 'twas done on∣ly as a Civil Action; on which I made such Remarks as, I think, so prophane a Practice deserv'd; and at
<PB N="288" REF="285"/>
last added, <HI>This is playing Bo-peep with God Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>And, pray Sir, if I may be so free with you, do but examine the Circumstance as I have laid it down, and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul, if <HI>you are not of the same Mind.</HI></P>
<P>The other Reflection is on such, who, tho' it be a∣gainst their Consciences, pretend 'tis to serve their Country: Of these, I say, <HI>They are Patriots indeed, who will Damn their Souls to save their Country:</HI> Not that thereby I imply, that to take the Sacrament with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd Damn any Mans Soul, if he communicated with a right Principle; but to do it to serve a Turn, which is the Question in hand, I won't answer for, tho' it were inverted from the Church to a Dissenting Congregation.</P>
<P>All these Instances, Sir, and more which I could reck∣on up, serve to make me admire wherein I have so provok'd you, as to remove you from your wonted Candor: And since my Writing on a Cause, which I expected fairer Quarter in, so exceedingly moves you, I shall chuse rather to lay down the Controversy, than to engage with a Person, who I shou'd be very much concern'd to see exceed the Rules which he has with so much Success, and so much Applause prescrib'd to others.</P>
<P>I always thought Men might Dispute without Rail∣ing, and Differ without Quarrelling; and that Opi∣nions need not affect our Tempers: But since it is not to be found, I leave it to those who have a better Talent that way than I.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>POSTCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>Besides your Book, Sir, which I think treats me <HI>Coursly enough;</HI> I am since threatned to be worse us'd by a Gentleman, who thinks himself concern'd in my affronting you, as he calls it.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="286"/>
I assure you, Sir, I do not charge you with any part of it; I believe you to be more a of a <HI>Christian,</HI> and more of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> nor am I sensible I gave you any affront, <HI>I am sure I intended you none.</HI></P>
<P>But because that Gentleman, I understand, expects some Answer this way, I have this to say to him;</P>
<P><HI>That if he thinks himself capable to give me Personal Correction, he knows me well enough, and need never want an opportunity to be Welcome.</HI></P>
