<P>WITH the greatest respect, I beg leave to lay the following scenes at your feet—My <HI>sole</HI> aim in writing them, was to blend In∣struction with Amusement.</P>
<P>TRULY sensible that Example operates much more powerfully than Precept, forgive my va∣nity in pointing out so perfect a character as <HI>your</HI>'s for imitation.</P>

<P>THE moment that a Reader takes up a Book with a Design to peruse it, he na∣turally wishes for all the Information possible, relative to the Writer and Writing of it—</P>
<P>WILLING, in every <HI>reasonable</HI> Degree, to sa∣tisfy the Curiosity of my good Friends and Purchasers, I shall candidly answer their fol∣lowing Questions:</P>
<P>Pray, who is the Author of this Comedy?</P>
<P><HI>A man in Obscurity, unnoticed, and content to re∣main so.</HI></P>
<P>Has it ever been performed in London?</P>
<P><HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>Was it ever offered to the Managers of either Theatre there?</P>
<P><HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>For what reason?</P>
<P><HI>Because the Author was truly sensible that it had not Merit sufficient to recommend it to their Notice.</HI></P>
<P>What are his Motives for publishing it now?</P>
<P><HI>Necessity, not Inclination.</HI></P>
<P>Is it worth purchasing?</P>
<P><HI>An odd Question—He is afraid not—But, good bye, Read on and judge for yourself.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO, Sedley, you really have been three weeks without seeing Miss Bloomer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, I assure you, Woodford, and intend, if my resolution holds, never to see her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I understood every thing was settled between you both, and that nothing remain'd but to name the happy day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, Woodford, no more.—It adds to my uneasiness to hear her mention'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I find, this too susceptible heart of mine cannot so readily erase the impressions her youth, beauty, and innocence have made upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! But what reason can you have for wishing it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greatest in the world, Woodford.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think so,—explain, or I shall certainly imagine you whimsical and capricious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I first paid my addresses to Miss Bloomer, such were the beauties of her mind as well
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>as person, that I fancied I had found one, all per∣fect as the first, before she fell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then were you in an Adamitical paradise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fool's one, rather,—she received me with such a flattering distinction that I thought myself the happiest of mortals, when unluckily, her guar∣dian's dying put her into the immediate possession of a large fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I should have thought that the luc∣kiest circumstance that cou'd have happen'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary,—thus freed from re∣straint, at the age of eighteen, she emerged into all the fashionable follies of the great world, without a real friend to advise, or direct her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did not you undertake that office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, but soon found it was an ungrateful one—so fine a girl, independent of interested mo∣tives, cou'd not fail of attracting a crowd of ad∣mirers; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, naturally grew jealous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous! My heart was torn in pieces.—'Twas then I discover'd a levity of temper, a thought∣lessness, a love of pleasure, that destroy'd my hopes.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but in time they threaten a total eclipse.—No character, however contemptible, but was en∣couraged as a lover.—No scene of gaiety, however censurable, but was pursued with avidity.—A thou∣sand instances did I patiently bear with, in hopes of amendment.—Oft in the gentlest terms, did I con∣vey advice, and represent the hazards she ran; as oft was I forbad her presence.</P>

<P>Hearky', Sedley, do you build anything upon this fellow's intelligence?—A wretch! that's an outcast, and disgrace to his nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet this very outcast, as he really is, does she treat in the most encouraging manner; and, without the least enquiry into his fortune or charac∣ter, admit amongst the number of her admirers.—But let us change the subject.—So then it seems your Uncle has civilly dismiss'd you his house?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so civilly, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think you deserved it? Captain Helm, you know, has spent the greater part of his life in ploughing the tempestuous ocean, and tho' possest of an excellent heart, has not the least idea of the refined sentiments inspired by a liberal education.—You were certain that your whole dependance was upon him, yet refus'd flattering the harmless foibles which peculiarly mark his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me, Sedley, I often did, till this last affair.—But, when he commenc'd my rival, my happiness was too much concern'd to trifle any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and has he declar'd his passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but as a preparatory step, he has given Lady Younglove (who is just return'd to town with her daughter) to understand, that for the fu∣ture, she must not encourage my pretensions, as I have nothing to expect from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! your hopes are all over in that quarter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely! I called yesterday, to welcome my dear girl, my beauteous Flora, to London, and was refused admittance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, and I am now reduced to such dis∣tress, that, unless you can assist me with your ad∣vice, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's my hand,—Depend upon my utmost, I feel too much myself, tho' from a different cause, not to compassionate you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expected no less from your generous friendship, but how shall we act?—What can I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, I don't know.—I own yours is a critical case.—But, we must not despair,—I be∣lieve as matters stand, we had best work by stratagem. Luckily, I stand high in the estimation of your Uncle, as well as Lady Younglove.</P>

<P>I wish you may not be mistaken in the pre∣sent case.</P>

<P>Never fear.—Let me see, <STAGE>(Panses)</STAGE> No, that won't do.—Stay, I believe I have it.—Suppose, I attack Lady Younglove myself, and persuade her, that I am dying for love of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, that's impossible,—'twould be too ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! I'll lay my life there's nothing easier.—Attack Widows by storm, and they can't resist you.—Besides, her time grows short, and as she was in such a violent hurry to get a second hus∣band, there's all the reason in the world to imagine her still more impatient for a third.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what end do you propose by this scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To serve you, but in what manner I have not yet determined.—Come, let's home to my house and consider farther.—Nay, nay, no excuses.—I see you are unfit to be left to yourself.—And the heart which does not feel the distress of a friend, is not worthy of existence.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Belgrove, you are come most opportunely—Do you know, that since I saw you last, I have made a fresh conquest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't find any thing so surprizing in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no, that's true, but I have now rose a step higher, and captivated a Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, or commoner, I suppose he'll share the same fate with the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my dear, you would not have me be unjust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really, I would not, therefore en∣tirely disapprove of your making such fools of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake, child, the generality of them were fools ready made to my hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of them might be so, but I don't find you are in the least more favourable to men of sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I hate your sensible men, and take a particular pleasure in tormenting them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very extraordinary.—But why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it adds more to my reputation, to lead in chains one of those wise Lords of the crea∣tion, who has sense enough to know I use him ill, yet not power sufficient to break his fetters, than a thousand of those mincing, whiffling, trifling, good-for-no∣thing, pretty, Master Jessamys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! tho' I shall never approve of your scheme, I almost wish for your spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirits, my dear!—Lord, what should put me out of spirits?—Time enough for me to pine and languish, when the Hey-day of my charms are over—Mine, I'm afraid, will be but a short reign, so am determin'd to make the most of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I find you do intend to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, some time or other.—. It wou'd mortify me prodigiously, to die an old maid.—No, no, I assure you, I have not the least ambi∣tion to lead apes, no more than I have at present to be led by one myself.—I wou'd only play with the male creatures, as a skilful angler does with his fish.—Amuse myself the sportive summer's day, bait my hook well for gudgeons, see the pretty innocents, nibble, nibble, nibble, as fast as I could cast in—Draw them out when I pleased—Stroke the delicate things, and then throw them in again—till evening sun having disagreeably lengthen'd my shadow, pick out the hero of the stream, and retire to my rustic cottage, content with the pleasures of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray, in the midst of this round of amusements, do you never feel a pang for the loss of Sedley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I really thought I had lost him for ever, I should be heartily mortified.</P>
</SP>

<P>Don't you think it begins to look like it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am a little alarmed,—for to confess the truth sincerely, which in those cases I very seldom do—Of all the men that ever address'd me, he is the only one who has made an imprestion on my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did not you use him better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not in my nature to be serious long together, therefore why should he expect it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider the many obligations you are under to him.—The many dangers he rescued you from, which your innocent levity exposed you to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but then he should not have taken so ungenerous an advantage of them, as to tell me, that I did wrong, and prescribe rules for my future conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were not those rules for your good?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but we are not always dispos'd to relish advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really think, if you lose him, you'll never meet with such another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am disappointed of him, I shall never have any other, that's past a doubt—And as a proof, were he now to return, I would frankly own, that, though I am innocent, even in intention of acting wrong, yet, my thoughtlessness, many times, leads me into great errors, which nothing but the sincerity of my heart can excuse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis great pity you did not make this declaration before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! he must take me, as he finds me.—Can he be so unconscionable as to expect, that I should draw up my head, hold down my eyes, put my hands together, drop him a low curtesy, and say,—I have been a naughty girl to be sure, but, pray forgive me this time, and indeed, and double deed, I'll do so no more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but he might reasonably expect, that you'd dismiss your numerous train of followers;
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>—and, as you have often sacrificed men of worth at the shrine of folly, so in return, to make a gene∣ral oblation—Offer up a hecatomb of fools, at the altar of discretion.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I bid the creatures follow me?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor don't you encourage them, when they do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Bloom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is, because I hate ill-nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are not you afraid your reputation should suffer?</P>

<P>You see I am laid upon the stocks a little, but no matter for that—Tho' my out-works are something damaged, yet my inside is heart of oak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it—Presuming, Captain, on the regard you always profest for me, I am now come to intercede in behalf of your nephew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Avast, avast, tack about, and pay away no more of that cable—My nephew, d'ye see, is a lazy land-lubber—If he had taken my advice, I would have made a man of him, and taught him to hand, reef, and steer, with e'er a seaman in the navy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are accomplishments, Captain, not suitable to every man's taste and genius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then their taste is not worth a rope's end—I myself, tho' a younger brother, made my own for∣tune while his father was squandering away his—I was twice round the globe, before I was forty—In every birth, from cabbin-boy, up to Captain of the Terrible—And now, having sufficient to lie by, I am resolved to enjoy it, and ride in a smooth har∣bour all the rest of my days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Captain, tho' you was so fond of the ocean, and had such success, your nephew may not have the same inclinations, and you should make some allowance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's not my way—So, if he has a mind to gain the wind of my affection, he must sheer off from the little frigate he has so long kept in chace, and let me fit him out for a vovage in the Tempest, which sails in a few weeks for the East-Indies.</P>
</SP>

<P>And in his absence, I suppose, you intend attacking Miss Flora yourself.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, I have some thoughts of bearing down that way.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, Captain, don't the great disparity of years between you and her, deter you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the more danger, the more honour—Mayhap, you may think it strange, that after steer∣ing so long clear of a wife, I should, all of a sudden, veer about, and clap the matrimonial tack aboard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that's long at sea, will find the wind blow from every point of the compass—I have sel∣dom been six months a-shore at one time, since I was a boy, so never had opportunity of coming a-long-side any but such as your Portsmouth or Plymouth fire∣ships, who damage every vessel they grapple with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And them, I suppose, you avoided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ay—So, d'ye see, being lately wea∣ther-bound in a trip I made to take observation of some land that lay a-head of Lady Younglove's, I was forced to put into port at her house.</P>

<P>Have you communicated your sentiments to the mother?</P>

<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the old hulk?—Ah, my boy, I'm afraid you are out of your reckoning there—You don't know the trim of her—She'll not be brought to obey either the helm, or the sheet, and if you'll take my advice, you'll e'en let her drop to pieces where she lies at anchor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll venture, however—The more danger, the more honour, as you say; and if you'll assist me, I don't doubt of succeeding.</P>

<P>Well, well, since the current of your incli∣nation sets that way, I shan't attempt to stem it—thof, let me tell you, she saw her two former con∣sorts go to the bottom, and if you don't take care, you'll share the same fate.</P>

<P>I confess, I have a terrible prospect, but nothing shall deter me—If you'll suspend your visit, I'll return as soon as our interview is over, and in form you of my success.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I shall lie by 'till then—But, hark∣ye, Sedley! may I never strike an enemy's flag a∣gain, if I would not rather be rak'd fore and aft by a whole French squadron, than stand one broad∣side from such a Turkish pirate.</P>

<P>I am transported to hear it—After his death, respect still sealed up my lips, 'till I found—for love, Madam, is Argus-eyed—that Mr. Wood∣ford frequented this house, and was, without doubt, a favour'd lover—This made me resolve to discover my hopeless passion, wait his arrival here, and thro' a happy rival's bosom, force my way to that heart which kings might be proud to call their own!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Own to you, Miss Belgrove, that, so far from being indifferent about Miss Bloomer, my heart never was more devoted to her, than at present—In vain, my reason shews the folly of my conduct, love has got possession of my soul with such absolute dominion, that every other passion bows to its resistless sway.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, you Lovers, are the most in∣consistent set of beings in the world—Absolute con∣tradictions—You love and hate, swear and forswear, whine and rage;—Resolve one moment, and break it the next—Tear the false image from your hearts this hour, and worship it with the grossest adulation the following one.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it, Madam, yet in me you'll not behold such a Proteus—I can love, without being blind.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible, for all lovers are blind, at least to the faults of their mistresses—But, no more of this—Take my word for it, Miss Bloomer is deser∣ving of your best wishes, and, tho' I cannot entirely defend the sprightly, tho' sometimes, imprudent sal∣lies of my fair friend; yet, I think them so venially agreeable, that they almost carry their excuse in the commission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, yet, in the present case, 'tis certain she encourages the addresses of some designing rascal, who, probably wants to make a prey of her person and fortune.</P>

<SPEAKER>Miss Belg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own it looks like it—When I saw her this morning, she hinted a new conquest of a Lord, and by the circumstances, I suspect Mrs. Fashion of being the contriver of the whole design.</P>

<P>Have you seen Miss Bloomer since you left Mrs. Fashion's?</P>

<P>UPON my word, Miss, this is the most oddest affair I was ever extricated in during the whole current of my life—After getting so artificially off as you did, for Mr. Sedley to dissuade your lovyer to return you to your mamma again, instead of flou∣rishing away to Scotland without redemption—Well!

<P>Ay, my dear, so it is—And, pray, what end did he impose by this wise scheme?</P>

<P>Why, as by such a precipitate step we should entirely forfeit the favour of his uncle, and my mamma, without the least chance of recovery, he persuaded Woodford to wait the issue of a scheme which he is going to execute immediately—For my part, if it does succeed, I shall lose half the plea∣sure I expected in being married in Scotland.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Frip.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, Miss, and speak the sensa∣tions of most of the girls who go there—Why, I might have been married three years ago to Mr. Scraper, Lord Supple's footman, but that we could not raise

<P>Confusion! are all my ravishing dreams of happiness come to this!—Oh, the incon∣stancy of mankind! there's neither love, faith, truth, or honour amongst them.</P>

<P>But, I hope, no bad consquences will follow your disappointment—No hanging, or drowning—O lud! I positively will give up all thoughts of him, sooner than be the death of any person.</P>

<P>Come, my Lady, forgive this innocent ar∣tifice, and look upon me as your best friend—You might have fallen a dupe to some designing villain—who, taking advantage of your weakness, would have ruined your family, and entailed perpetual misery on yourself.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! we are all run on a lee shore, here!—Why, widow, you have kept a devilish bad reckon∣ing—But I thought how it would be—As for your generosity, Mr. Sedley, in favour of my little cock∣boat, why, I heartily thank you—And, as soon as the parson can tip us a cocket, we'll steer away for matrimony harbour, directly.</P>

<P>And now, Woodford, thanks to Mr. Sed∣ley's
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>generosity, I have it in my power to manifest my love—Here, take my hand, my fortune's more than sufficient to enable us to live happily, though not splendidly—But, were it not, be assured, I would chearfully prefer poverty and a cottage, with the ob∣ject of my choice, before riches and the most splen∣did palace with the man I dislike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Madam, the temple of Hymen was reared by virtue, and only occasionally embel∣lished by Plutus.—Captain, I am sure, if you seri∣ously consider every thing, you will soon be of the young Lady's mind.</P>

<P>And, you young dog, do you recollect what a cruel constraint you are putting upon mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, Captain, you are a noble-spirited, worthy-hearted Briton—Only reflect, with such a great disparity of years and temper, what a ridicu∣lous figure you must make united to so blooming a girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, for all the world, like David and Abishag, in our old tapestry hangings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, be generous, and act like yourself—Fill up the marriage settlements with your nephew's name, instead of your own, and receive the thanks, nay, the blessings of the young couple, for so lau∣dable an act.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Swab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, an please your honour, I do think your works are too much damaged, to venture out to sea again—You'd certainly founder in the first storm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so, Swab?—Then let us tack about, and alter our course—Come hither, nephew, I forgive you what's past—You shall go master in my stead, and here are bills of freight and lading for the voyage—But, harkee, as you are a young sea∣man, take my advice—Don't crowd too much sail, or you'll be apt to overset.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodf.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, uncle, I'll steer by your di∣rection—your goodness to me on this occasion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No fair-weather speeches, but mind your business—And, d'ye hear, boy, by way of encou∣ragement to serve his Majesty, you shall have a thou∣sand pounds bounty money for every young volun∣teer you produce, as soon as ever they are able to cry, Huzza! King George and his navy for ever—Ay, damme! tho' you should have above the royal dozen!</P>

<P>Do the same, Captain?—I did not rightly understand you—You have not, surely, any notion of paying your addresses to me?</P>
<STAGE>(Crosses over to him)</STAGE>

<P>But, hearkee, have you hail'd her yet, to know whether she'd chuse to take you on board?</P>

<P>Why, no, your honour; I'm too good a seaman to launch out on so long a cruize without my commander's leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, then, Swab, if that's the case, after her directly, and bring her too as soon as possible.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sedley.</SPEAKER>
<P>We accept your offer, Captain, happy in having our adventures brought to so agreeable a con∣clusion—I only beg leave to remark—That though our follies and vices justly deserve the comic lash—Yet, when, instead of persevering, we nobly ac∣knowledge our errors, and amend—Satire then loses her sting, our foibles turn to virtues, and, the most permanent felicity arises from THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART.</P>
