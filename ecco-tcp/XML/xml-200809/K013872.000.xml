<P>THE SPANISH LADY, A MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT, IN TWO ACTS; Founded on the PLAN of the OLD BALLAD.</P>
<P>As performed at the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Will you hear of a SPANISH Lady,</L>
<L>How she woo'd an ENGLISH Man?</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Author of this little Piece having already thought it incumbent on him, to explain, in the public Paper, his Motives for writ∣ing it, and the Reasons, why it did not make it's Ap∣pearance on the Stage at that time, he presumes a Repetition of those will be the most proper Preface to it here.</P>
<P>The elegant Simplicity of the Old Ballad (which has been justly remarked by many writers of allowed Taste) had often induced me to wish to see it modelled into a Petite-piece. The Advice of a singular Conquest, ob∣tained over Spain, in the Year 1762, influenced me to attempt it. I thought the Scene might, not im∣probably, be laid there; and that some few Hints, tending to illustrate, and (as far as so small a Produc∣tion might be able) to perpetuate that glorious Ex∣ploit,
<PB REF="3"/>
would, while popular Praise and Admiration was alive and warm, attone for what Deficiences might be found in the Conduct and Diction, such a kind of Undertaking being really new to me.</P>
<P>With this View, the Piece was received, licensed, and rehearsed at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> the Winter before last—but the Disturbances, which then happened at both Theatres, obstructed the intended Performance.</P>
<P>If now stands as a simple Fable, and may be con∣sidered merely as the Story of the SPANISH LADY brought forward into View. If, in the principal Scene between the English Officer, and the Lady, I have not wholly destroyed the pathetic Simplicity of my Original, I should hope, with the Assistance of the Music, (which has been selected under the Inspection of an eminent Composer) that the Piece may not be found un-enter∣taining to a delicate, and a feeling Mind. Wherever I could, I have used the very Words of the Ballad, which, for the Satisfaction of a curious Eye, I have hereunto annexed.</P>
<P>In this plain Dress, my Production now appeals to the Candour of an English Audience,</P>
<P>And is,</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>IEUTENANT, good Morrow. You're not blown away then! Prythee how did your Ves∣sel weather out that dreadful Hurricane last Night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LIEUTENANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why tolerably well, at last. And yet I thought, some∣times, we shou'd never have crack'd Biscuit again. In all the Voyages I have made, (and I have rode out many a hard Gale) I never was so near going to the Bottom. You Landmen, now, lie safe enough.</P>

<SPEAKER>ENSIGN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what you mean by safe; the Devil cou'd not have slept in such a Storm! I'll swear, the Fort shook about our Ears with ten Times the Vio∣lence it did, when the Mine was sprung, and I was more alarm'd. Yet, Lieutenant, that was no trifling Work.</P>

<SPEAKER>LIEUTENANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trifling! No, faith; for that resolute Dog, the Go∣vernor, laid about him, like a Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. SOLDIER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Fellow! It so griev'd the Heart of me, to see him, when the cowardly Rascals had all left him, oblig'd to give up his Sword, that I cou'd have cry'd for him, if I had not thought it a Shame for a Soldier in Action.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. SOLDIER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but, Ben, shall you ever forget our Commander's Usage of him, upon that Occasion? I cod! 'tis my O∣pinion, the Governor was not very sorry to lose his Friends, when he found so good an Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LIEUTENANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ensign, can you tell me where your good Commander, <HI>Worthy,</HI> is? I have a Message to him from our Admiral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENSIGN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect him here every Moment. He went to the Go∣vernor's just now, and said, he wou'd return soon. I am waiting fresh Orders.</P>

<P>He may depend on their being on Board by Noon;—If at Leisure, I shou'd be glad to see him, in the Even∣ing, at my Quarters.</P>

<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ensign, a Word. Have you seen the poor Widow, and her Children to Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>ENSIGN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir,—The Children are all purely, except the Eldest, who seems chain'd to her Mother's Chair; 'Tis hard to say, which of the two has cry'd most. When I gave her the Purse, she wou'd have express'd her thanks, but her Amazement, a while, prevented her. At last she had just sighed out your Name, when I produced her poor dead Husband's Watch, which I discover'd, last Night, at George Ravage's; the very sight of it threw her into such an A∣gony, that I was oblig'd to leave it in her Lap, and run off. It was too much for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You give me Pleasure to hear you say so. Good Mor∣row, good Ensign. When you repeat your Visit, only caution them never to discover my Name; and let it, on your part, be kept equally Secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ENSIGN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll be sure to observe you with Care, Sir; you have no farther Commands, at present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, but to desire you will be early enough with me in the Morning, that we may have sufficient Time for the charitable Duties we are engag'd in.</P>

<P>You may depend upon me, Sir, I receive your Orders with Pleasure. Good Morrow, Sir, <STAGE>[Exit. with Soldiers.]</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ensign, your Servant! I like this young Fellow. The Readiness and Satisfaction, with which he undertakes a good Action, are singularly agreeable. Such a Disposi∣tion reflects Pleasure on itself, and doubles every Favour to the Object it obliges.—How truly valuable in a Soldier, when Success has crown'd his Arms!</P>
<LG>

<L>A Triumph, that never can fade,</L>
<L>In the Conqueror's Bosom must spring,</L>
<L>When conscious he duly has paid,</L>
<L>His Debt to his Country and King;</L>
<L>But a Pleasure, surpassing it far,</L>

<P>So, Major, you have finish'd your Visit. Well, will you return, and dine with this good Family? I have pro∣mis'd myself to them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>HEARTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to Day, Sir; I have some Engagements, which, I think, will not release me Time enough; beside, I have no great Pleasure in seeing the poor Girl dine upon looking at you.</P>

<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again! You will still persist in that Mistake!</P>

<P>No Mistake, indeed, Sir, Her Confusion when you enter the Room, unceasing Sighs during your Stay, At∣tention when you speak.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>All easily to be accounted for. Her obsequious Re∣gard to one, whom she cannot look on, yet, but in the Light of her Conqueror; her hourly Anxiety for her Fa∣ther's Situation, his Wounds not promising so favourably, as might be wish'd.—A thousand Interpretations may be made of her Behaviour.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>All, surely, conducing to prove the Truth of what I say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me it does not appear so; nor can I yet, with all you can say, give into the idle Vanity, of indulging such Notions, as would be inconsistent with my Principles and Situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HEARTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Principles, indeed, I am no Stranger to; nor am I wishing you should break thro' them; all I presume to urge is, that, if you were inclin'd so to do, here is a fair Occasion offer'd you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>WORTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis an Experiment, I shall not be induc'd to make; yet, were I ever so strongly inclin'd to it, it must be Length of Time, and very plain Circumstances, alone could con∣vince me of the Fairness of such an Occasion. I cannot bear that cruel Misinterpretation of a Woman's Behaviour, which supposes her Good-humour, and Affability, can have no End but Love.</P>

Even to his Foes he shews so lovely, that his Beneficence, and humane Care of all around him, make him appear rather a Father, than a Conqueror.

SPANIARDS fraught with Jealousy</L>

<L>Leave me not unto a SPANIARD,</L>
<L>Thou alone enjoy'st my Heart;</L>
<L>I am loving, young, and tender,</L>
<L>Love is likewise my Desert.</L>
<L>Still to serve thee Day and Night,</L>
<L>My Mind is prest;</L>
<L>The Wife of every Englishman</L>
<L>Is surely blest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It would be a Shame, fair Lady,</L>
<L>For to bear a Woman hence:</L>
<L>English Soldiers never carry</L>
<L>Any such without Offence.</L>
<L>I will quickly change myself,</L>
<L>If it be so,</L>
<L>And like a Page will follow thee,</L>
<L>Wheree'er you go.</L>

<L>Extremity;</L>

<L>My Life for thee.</L>

<L>Courteous Lady, leave this Fancy,</L>
<L>Here comes all that breeds this Strise,</L>
<L>I in ENGLAND have already</L>
<L>A sweet Woman to my Wife.</L>
<L>I will not falsify my Vow</L>
<L>For Gold nor Gain,</L>
<L>Nor yet for all the fairest Dames</L>
<L>Which are in SPAIN.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! how happy is that Woman,</L>
<L>Who enjoys so true a Friend!</L>
<L>Many Days I pray God send her,</L>
<L>Thus of my Suit I make an End:</L>

<L>Love, and all his Laws defy:</L>
<L>In a Nunn'ry, I will shrowd me</L>
<L>Far from any Company.</L>
<L>But ere my Prayers have an End,</L>
<L>Be sure of this,</L>

<L>Farewell to my Heart's Content.</L>
<L>Count not Spanish Ladies wanton,</L>
<L>Tho' to thee my Heart was bent.</L>
<L>All Joy and true Prosperity</L>
