<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE youth I sing, who, to himself unknown,</L>
<L>Lost to the world and CALEDONIA's throne,</L>
<L>Sprung o'er his mountains to the arms of Fame,</L>
<L>And, wing'd by Fate, his sire's avenger, came;</L>
<L>That knowledge learn'd, so long deny'd by fate,</L>
<L>And found that blood, as merit, made him great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The aged chieftain on the bier is laid,</L>
<L>And grac'd with all the honours of the dead;</L>
<L>The youthful warriors, as the corse they bear,</L>
<L>Droop the sad head, and shed the gen'rous tear.</L>
<L>For Abria's shore, Tay's winding banks they leave,</L>
<L>And bring the Hero to his father's grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>His filial tears the godlike ALPIN sheds,</L>
<L>And tow'rds the foe his gallant warriors leads.</L>
<L>The chief along his silent journey wound,</L>
<L>And fix'd his rainy eyes upon the ground;</L>
<L>Behind advanc'd his followers sad and slow,</L>
<L>In all the dark solemnity of woe.</L>
<L>Mean time fierce SCANDINAVIA's hostile pow'r,</L>
<L>Its squadrons spread along the murm'ring shore;</L>
<L>Prepar'd, at once, the city to invade,</L>
<L>And conquer CALEDONIA in her head.</L>
<L>His camp, for night, the royal SUENO forms,</L>
<L>Resolv'd with morn to use his Danish arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now in the ocean sunk the flaming day,</L>
<L>And streak'd the ruddy west with setting ray;</L>
<L>Around great INDULPH, in the senate sat</L>
<L>The noble Chiefs of CALEDONIA's, state.</L>
<L>In mental scales they either forces weigh,</L>
<L>And act, before, the labours of the day;</L>
<L>Arrange in thought their CALEDONIA's might,</L>
<L>And bend their little army to the fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus they consult. Brave ALPIN's martial gait,</L>
<L>Approach'd the portals of the dome of state;</L>
<L>Resolv'd to offer to his king and lord,</L>
<L>The gen'rous service of his trusty sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Th' unusual sight the gallant chief admires,</L>
<L>The bending arches and the lofty spires.</L>
<L>On either side the gate, in order stand</L>
<L>The antient Kings of CALEDONIA's land.</L>
<L>The marble lives, they breathe within the stone,</L>
<L>And still, as once, the royal warriors frown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The FERGUS's are seen above the gate;</L>
<L>This first created, that restor'd the state.</L>
<L>In warlike pomp, the awful forms appear,</L>
<L>And, bending, threaten from the stone the spear;</L>
<L>While to their side young ALEION seems to rise,</L>
<L>And on her fathers turns her smiling eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And next appears GREGORIUS' awful name,</L>
<L>HIBERNIA's conqu'ror for a gen'rous fame.</L>
<L>Incass'd in arms, the royal Hero stands,</L>
<L>And gives his captive all his conquer'd lands.</L>
<L>The filial heart of hapless ALPIN's son,</L>
<L>In marble melts and beats within the stone.</L>
<L>Revenge still sparkles in the Hero's eye;</L>
<L>Around the PICTS, a nameless slaughter, lye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youthful warrior thus reviews, with joy,</L>
<L>The godlike series of his ancestry.</L>
<L>The godlike forms the drooping HERO cheer,</L>
<L>And keen ambition half believes the seer:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Eager he shoots into the spacious gate;</L>
<L>His eye commands, without his followers wait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No frowning spear-man guards the awful door;</L>
<L>No borrow'd terror arms the hand of pow'r:</L>
<L>No cringing bands of sycophants appear,</L>
<L>To send false echoes to the monarch's ear.</L>
<L>Merit's sost voice, oppression's mournful groan,</L>
<L>Advanc'd, unstiffl'd, to th' attentive throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero, ent'ring, took his solemn stand</L>
<L>Among the gallant warriors of the land.</L>
<L>His manly port, the staring chiefs admire;</L>
<L>And half-heard whispers blow the soldier's fire.</L>
<L>A while his form engag'd the monarch's eyes,</L>
<L>At length he raised the music of his voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Whence is the youth? I see fierce DENMARK warms</L>
<L>Each gen'rous breast, and fires 'em into arms.</L>
<L>A face once known is in that youth exprest,</L>
<L>And mends a dying image in my breast."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said: And thus the Youth; "'midst rocks afar,</L>
<L>I heard of DENMARK, and of SUENO's war.</L>
<L>My country's safety in my bosom rose;</L>
<L>For CALEDONIA's sons should meet her foes.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
We ought not meanly wait the storm at home,</L>
<L>But rush afar, and break it 'ere it come.</L>
<L>Few are my foll'wers, but these few are true;</L>
<L>We come to serve our country, fame, and you!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said: The king retorts; "thy form, thy mind,</L>
<L>Declare the scion of a gen'rous kind;</L>
<L>With SCOTIA's foes maintain the stern debate,</L>
<L>And spring from valour to the arms of state.</L>
<L>Whoe'er would raise his house in ALBION, shou'd</L>
<L>Lay the foundation in her en'mies' blood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then to the Chiefs: "Supporters of my throne,</L>
<L>Your sires brought oft the Roman Eagles down.</L>
<L>Yourselves, my lords, have caus'd the haughty DANE,</L>
<L>To curse the land, he try'd so oft in vain.</L>
<L>Norvegian firs oft brought them o'er the waves,</L>
<L>For ALBION's crown; but ALBION gave'em graves.</L>
<L>Be still the same, exert yourselves like men,</L>
<L>And of th' invaders wash our rocks again.</L>
<L>Tho' few our numbers, these, in arms grown old,</L>
<L>In ALBION's and in INDULPH's cause are bold.</L>
<L>The brave man looks not, when the clarion sounds,</L>
<L>To hostile numbers, but his country's wounds;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Bold to the last and dauntless he'll go on,</L>
<L>At once his country's soldier and her son."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The monarch thus his royal mind exprest;</L>
<L>The patriot kindling in each gen'rous breast.</L>
<L>Each chieftain's mind with pleasure goes before,</L>
<L>Already mingling with the battle's roar.</L>
<L>In thought each Hero sweeps the bloody plain,</L>
<L>And deals, in fancy, death upon the DANE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DUMBAR arose, the brave remains of wars,</L>
<L>Silver'd with years, o'er-run with honest scars;</L>
<L>Great in the senate, in the field renown'd;</L>
<L>The senior stood: attention hung arround.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thus: "Fierce DENMARK all the North commands,</L>
<L>And belches numbers on our neighb'ring lands,</L>
<L>England's subdu'd, the Saxons are o'ercome,</L>
<L>And meanly own a Danish lord at home.</L>
<L>Scarce now a blast from SCANDINAVIA roars,</L>
<L>But wafts a hostile squadron to our shores.</L>
<L>One fleet destroy'd, another crowns the waves,</L>
<L>The sons seem anxious for their father's graves:</L>
<L>Thus war returns in an eternal round,</L>
<L>Battles on baules press, and wound on wound.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Our numbers thinn'd, our godlike warriors dead,</L>
<L>Pale CALEDONIA hangs her sickly head;</L>
<L>We must be wise, be frugal of our store,</L>
<L>Add art to arms, and caution to our pow'r.</L>
<L>Beneath the sable mantle of the night,</L>
<L>Rush on the foe, and, latent, urge the fight.</L>
<L>Conduct with few may foil this mighty pow'r,</L>
<L>And DENMARK shun th' inhospitable shore."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The senior spoke: a gen'ral voice approves;</L>
<L>To arm his kindred-bands each chief removes.</L>
<L>Night from the east the drousy world invades,</L>
<L>And clothes the warriors in her dusky shades:</L>
<L>The vassal-throng advance, a manly cloud,</L>
<L>And with their sable ranks the chieftains shroud.</L>
<L>Each chief, now here, now there, in armour shines,</L>
<L>Waves thro' the ranks, and draws the lengthen'd lines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, on a night when rattling tempests war,</L>
<L>Thro' broken clouds appears a blazing star;</L>
<L>Now veils its head, now rushes on the sight,</L>
<L>And shoots a livid horror thro' the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The full form'd columns, in the midnight hour,</L>
<L>Begin their silent journey tow'rds the shore:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Thro' ev'ry rank the chiefs inciting roam,</L>
<L>And rouzing whispers hiss along the gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A rising hill, whose night-invelop'd brow</L>
<L>Hung o'er th' incamped squadrons of the foe,</L>
<L>Shoots to the deep its ooze immantled arm,</L>
<L>And, steadfast, struggles with the raging storm;</L>
<L>Here ends the moving host its winding road:</L>
<L>And here condenses, like a sable cloud,</L>
<L>Which long was gath'ring-on the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>Then broke in thunder on the vales below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again the chiefs, in midnight council met,</L>
<L>Before the king maintain the calm debate:</L>
<L>This waits the equal contest of the day,</L>
<L>That rushes, headlong, to the nightly fray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length young ALPIN stood, and thus begun,</L>
<L>"Great king, supporter of our antient throne!</L>
<L>Brought up in mountains, and from councils far,</L>
<L>I am a novice in the art of war;</L>
<L>Yet hear this thought.—Within the womb of night,</L>
<L>Confirm the troops, and arm the youth for fight;</L>
<L>While softly-treading to yon' camp I go,</L>
<L>And mark the disposition of the foe:</L>
<L>Or, wakeful, arm they for the dismal fight,</L>
<L>Or, wrapt within the lethargy of night,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Are left abandon'd to our SCOTTISH sword,</L>
<L>By sleep's soft hand, in fatal chains secur'd.</L>
<L>If DENMARK sleeps in night's infolding arms,</L>
<L>Expect your spy to point out latent storms;</L>
<L>But, they in arms, too long delay'd my speed,</L>
<L>Then place the faithful scout among the dead."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A gen'ral voice th' exploring thought approves,</L>
<L>And ev'ry wish with youthful ALPIN moves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Hero slides along the gloom of night,</L>
<L>The camp-fires send afar their gleaming light;</L>
<L>Athwart his side the trusty sabre flies,</L>
<L>The various plaid hangs, plaited, down his thighs:</L>
<L>The crested helm waves, awful, on his head;</L>
<L>His manly trunk the mail and corslet shade:</L>
<L>The pond'rous spear supports his dusky way;</L>
<L>The waving steel reflects the stellar way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Arriv'd, the dauntless youth solemnly slow,</L>
<L>Observant, mov'd along the silent foe.</L>
<L>Some 'brac'd in arms the midnight vigil keep,</L>
<L>Some o'er the livid camp-fires nod to sleep:</L>
<L>The feeding courser to the stake is bound,</L>
<L>The prostrate horseman stretch'd along the ground:</L>
<L>Extended here the brawny footman lay,</L>
<L>And, dosing, wore the lazy night away.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
The watchman there, by sleep's soft hand o'er∣power'd,</L>
<L>Starts at the blast, and half unsheaths his sword.</L>
<L>Th' exploring youth, thro' night's involving cloud,</L>
<L>Circling the foe, their disposition view'd.</L>
<L>At length the Hero's dusky journey ends,</L>
<L>Where HACO feasted with his Danish friends;</L>
<L>HACO, by more than SUENO's blood, was great;</L>
<L>The promis'd monarch of the triple state.</L>
<L>The Scandinavian camp the youth secur'd</L>
<L>With watchful troops, and not unfaithful sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two oaks, from earth by headlong tempests torn,</L>
<L>Supply the fire, and in the circle burn;</L>
<L>Around with social talk the feast they share,</L>
<L>And drown in bowls the CALEDONIAN war:</L>
<L>O'erpower'd, at length, by slumber's silken hand,</L>
<L>They press the beach, and cow'r upon the strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A gallant deed the Mountain-youth design'd,</L>
<L>And nurs'd a growing action in his mind.</L>
<L>Awful the chief advanc'd: his armour bright</L>
<L>Reflects the fire and shines along the night.</L>
<L>Hov'ring he stood above the sleeping-band,</L>
<L>And shone, an awful column, o'er the strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<L>Thus, osten to the midnight traveller,</L>
<L>The stalking figures of the dead appear:</L>
<L>Silent the spectre tow'rs before the sight,</L>
<L>And shines, an awful image, thro' the night.</L>
<L>At length the giant phantom hovers o'er</L>
<L>Some grave unhallow'd, stain'd with murder'd gore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus ALPIN stood: He exiles to the dead</L>
<L>Six-warrior-youths; the trembling remnant fled;</L>
<L>Young HACO starts, unsheaths his shining sword,</L>
<L>And views his friends in iron-chains secur'd.</L>
<L>He rushes, headlong, on the daring foe;</L>
<L>The godlike ALPIN renders blow for blow.</L>
<L>Their clatt'ring swords on either armour fell;</L>
<L>Fire flashes round, as steel contends with steel.</L>
<L>Young ALPIN's sword on HACO's helmet broke,</L>
<L>And to the ground the stagg'ring warrior took.</L>
<L>Leaning on his broad shield the hero bends;</L>
<L>ALPIN, aloft in air, his sword suspends:</L>
<L>His arm up-rais'd, he downward bends his brow,</L>
<L>But scorn'd to take advantage of the-foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young HACO from his hand the weapon threw,</L>
<L>And from his flaming breast these accents drew.</L>
<L>"Bravest of men! who cou'd thro' night come on,</L>
<L>Who durst attack, and foil an host alone.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
I see the man high on the warrior plac'd,</L>
<L>Both mend each other in your noble breast.</L>
<L>Accept, brave man, the friendship of a Dane,</L>
<L>Who hates the Scot, but yet can love the man."</L>
<L>He said: while thus the Scot; "with joy, I find</L>
<L>The man so pow'rful in an en'my's mind;</L>
<L>Your forces fled, amidst night's dark alarms,</L>
<L>You both cou'd stand, and use your gallant arms:</L>
<L>Such valiant deeds thy dauntless soul confess,</L>
<L>That I the warrior, tho' the Dane, embrace."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His brawny arms he round the Hero flung;</L>
<L>As they embrace the clashing corslets rung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Dane resumes: "With the sun's rising beam,</L>
<L>We may, in fields of death, contend for fame;</L>
<L>Receive this shield, that, midst to-morrow's storms,</L>
<L>HACO may, grateful, shun his well-known arms."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and gave the gold-enamel'd round;</L>
<L>While, as he reach'd, the studded thongs resound.</L>
<L>The amicable colloquy they end,</L>
<L>And each a foe, clasp'd in his arms a friend.</L>
<L>This to the camp his dusky journey bends;</L>
<L>While that to ALBION's chiefs the hill ascends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' exploring journey, all, with pleasure, hear,</L>
<L>And own the valiant scout their noble care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<L>Dissolv'd the council, the attack declin'd,</L>
<L>Each with the gift of sleep indulg'd his mind;</L>
<L>And 'midst his kindred-bands, supinely laid,</L>
<L>Each softly slumber'd on a mossy bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His mind to soft repose young ALPIN bends,</L>
<L>And seeks the humble circle of his friends:</L>
<L>Reelining on a rock the Hero lies,</L>
<L>And gradual slumbers steal upon his eyes.</L>
<L>Still to his mind the DANISH camp arose,</L>
<L>Hung on his dreams, and hagg'd his calm repose;</L>
<L>Once more he mix'd with HACO in the sight</L>
<L>And urg'd, impending, on the DANISH flight</L>

<L>HEav'n's op'ning portals shot the beam of day;</L>
<L>Earth chang'd her sable robe to sprightly grey:</L>
<L>To West's dark goal the humid night is fled,</L>
<L>The sun, o'er ocean, rears his beamy head:</L>
<L>The splendid gleam from Scottish steel returns,</L>
<L>And all the light reflexive mountains burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Deep-sounding bag-pipes, gaining on the air,</L>

<L>The gallant chiefs, along the mountain's brow,</L>

<L>The martial sound foments their kindling rage;</L>
<L>Onward they rush, and in a shout engage.</L>
<L>The swords thro' air their gleaming journeys fly,</L>
<L>Crash on the helms and tremble in the sky.</L>
<L>Groan follows groan, and wound succeeds on wound,</L>
<L>While dying bodies quiver on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when devouring hatchet-men invade,</L>
<L>With sounding steel, the forest's leavy head,</L>
<L>The mountains ring with their repeated strokes;</L>
<L>The tap'ring firs, the elms, the aged oaks,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Quake at each gash; then nod the head and yield;</L>
<L>Groan as they fall, and tremble on the field.</L>
<L>Thus fell the men; blood forms a lake around,</L>
<L>While groans and spears hoarse harmony resound.</L>
<L>The mountains hear, and thunder back the noise,</L>
<L>And eccho stammers with unequal voice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As yet the battle hung in doubtful scales;</L>
<L>Each bravely fought, in death or only fails.</L>
<L>All, all are bent on death or victory,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to conquer, or with glory die.</L>
<L>Fierce DENMARK's honour kindles fire in these;</L>
<L>On these pale ALBION bends her parent-eyes.</L>
<L>This sternly says, "shall DENMARK's children fly?"</L>
<L>But that, "or save, or with your country die."</L>
<L>The SCOTS, a Stream, wou'd sweep the DANES away,</L>
<L>The DANES, a Rock, repell'd the SCOTS array.</L>
<L>They fight alternate, and alternate fly,</L>
<L>Both wound, both conquer, both with glory die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice HACO strove to break DUMBAR's array,</L>
<L>And thrice DUMBAR impell'd him to the sea.</L>
<L>The fiery MAGNUS, foaming on the right,</L>
<L>Pours on the Mountain-chiefs his warrior-might.</L>
<L>The Mountain-youths the furious chief restrain,</L>

<L>The ranks of SUENO stand in firm array,</L>
<L>As hoary rocks repel the raging sea.</L>
<L>The HERO to the phalanx crouds his might,</L>
<L>And calmly manages the standing fight;</L>
<L>Not idly madd'ning in the bloody fray,</L>
<L>He wears delib'rately the foe away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Straight on his spear the godlike ALPIN stood,</L>
<L>His flaming armour 'smear'd with Danish blood:</L>
<L>He casts behind an awe-commanding look,</L>
<L>And to his few, but valiant, followers spoke.</L>
<L>"The cautious DANES, O friends, in firm array,</L>
<L>With perseverance may secure the day;</L>
<L>Our people fall.—Let us their force divide;</L>
<L>Invade with flame their transports on the tide.</L>
<L>They will defend, the SCOTS restore the day;</L>
<L>Follow, my friends, your ALPIN leads the way."</L>
<L>He said, and rush'd upon the phalanx'd DANE,</L>
<L>The bending ranks beneath his sword complain.</L>
<L>Arms, groans of men, beat time to ev'ry wound,</L>
<L>Nod at each blow, and thunder on the ground.</L>
<L>Behind his friends advance with martial care,</L>
<L>Move step for step, and spread the lane of war.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus valiant ALPIN hews his bloody way,</L>
<L>And thus his friends force thro' their firm array;</L>
<L>With great effort he seizes on the strand,</L>
<L>Turns to his friends, and issues his command.</L>

<L>"Thicken your lines, the battle's shock sustain,</L>

<L>He added not.—The valiant youths obey:</L>
<L>The HERO shap'd along his rapid way;</L>
<L>Rush'd to the camp, and seiz'd a flaming brand,</L>
<L>Then took his lofty seat upon the strand.</L>
<L>Swift, from his arm, the crackling ember flies,</L>
<L>Whizzes along, and kindles in the skies:</L>
<L>The pitchy hull receives the sparkling fire;</L>
<L>The kindling ship the fanning winds inspire.</L>
<L>Black smoke ascends: at length the flames arise,</L>

<L>The riding fleet is all in darkness lost,</L>

Red embers, falling from the burning shroud,</L>

<L>Great SUENO turns, and sees the flame behind</L>

<L>Then thus to ERIC—"Urge your speedy flight,</L>
<L>Recal the fiery MAGNUS from the right:</L>
<L>Quick let him come! th' endanger'd transports save,</L>
<L>And dash against the burning ship the wave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth obeys, and, flying o'er the sand,</L>
<L>Repeats in MAGNUS' ear the king's command.</L>
<L>The warrior starts, rage sparkling in his eyes,</L>
<L>He tow'rs along resounding as he flies:</L>
<L>He comes.—From SUENO's army squadrons fall</L>
<L>Around the chief, and rear the manly wall;</L>
<L>Till in their front the stately chief appears,</L>
<L>They wave, behind, an iron wood of spears;</L>

<L>Bent to support the flame, his thin array</L>
<L>Young ALPIN draws along the murm'ring sea,</L>
<L>He holds the massy spear in act to throw,</L>

<L>Advanc'd.—with awful din the fight began;</L>

<L>Fierce MAGNUS, here, wou'd rush into the main:</L>
<L>Young ALPIN, there, wou'd keep at bay the DANE.</L>
<L>One pushes the swift boat into the sea;</L>

<L>Another dashes to the ship the wave,</L>

<L>Great MAGNUS, burning at the dismal sight,</L>

<L>"Degen'rate DANES"—The raging warrior cries,</L>

<L>The men advance.—proceeds their haughty lord,</L>

He said.—The Mountain-warrior turns his eyes,</L>

<L>Great MAGNUS falling on young ALPIN's shield,</L>

<L>Revengful ALPIN, with descending blade,</L>
<L>Crashes the shining thunder on his head.</L>
<L>They aim, defend; their swords, at every stroke,</L>
<L>Talk on the way, and gleam along the smoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length on MAGNUS Fate deals home a wound,</L>
<L>He nods to death, and thunders on the ground.</L>
<L>Starting from the wide wound the bubbling blood,</L>
<L>Sinks thro' the sand, and rolls a smoaking flood.</L>

<L>The DANES beholding their commander die,</L>

<L>While thus the en'my's front the chieftains wore,</L>

<L>By slow degrees their force declines away,</L>

"Hear me, ye chiefs," the mournful monarch cries,</L>
<L>"We fall to day, our state, our country dies.</L>
<L>Let us acquit ourselves of ALBION's death,</L>

<L>Ready to fight the royal warriors stood,</L>

<L>The CALEDONIAN chiefs, to shun the storm,</L>

<L>The battle frowns as yet upon their brow.</L>
<L>The monarch rose, and leaning on the oak,</L>
<L>Stretch'd out his hand, and to the nobles spoke.</L>
<L>"My lords! the DANES, for so just heav'n decreed,</L>

<L>"To save our king, our country's antient throne,</L>

<L>And swept our mountains with his pilf'ring band;</L>
<L>All day they drove our cattle to the sea,</L>

<LG>
<L>The warrior-band move on in firm array,</L>
<L>He tow'rs before along the sounding sea.</L>
<L>Thro' their tall spears the singing tempest raves,</L>
<L>And, falling headlong on the spumy waves,</L>
<L>Pursues the ridgy sea with awful roar,</L>

<L>Along the walls of uncemented stone.</L>
<L>Here all the noble warriors crown the bowl,</L>
<L>And with the gen'rous nectar warm the soul;</L>
<L>With social talk steal lazy time away,</L>
<L>Recounting all the dangers of the day:</L>
<L>They turn to ALPIN, and the gloomy fight,</L>
<L>And tost the gallant warrior of the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time young ALPIN 'girts the fatal wood,</L>
<L>And longs to mix again with DANISH blood.</L>
<L>Already HACO had, with martial care,</L>
<L>With walls of oak embrac'd an ample square:</L>
<L><PB REF="38"/>
Himself beneath a tree, the storm defends,</L>
<L>And keeps in arms, around, his watchful friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fair Aurelia by the hero's side,</L>
<L>An awful warrior, and a blooming bride,</L>
<L>Who plac'd in martial deeds her virgin-care,</L>
<L>Wields in her snowy hand the ashen spear.</L>
<L>A silver mail hung round her slender waist,</L>
<L>The corslet rises on her heaving breast.</L>
<L>On her white arm the brazen buckler shows,</L>
<L>The shining helm embrac'd her marble brows;</L>
<L>Her twining ringlets, flowing down behind,</L>
<L>Sung grateful music to the nightly wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fate was unkind; just as the lovers wed,</L>
<L>Nor yet had tasted of the nuptial bed;</L>
<L>Great SUENO's trumpet call'd the youth to war,</L>
<L>He sigh'd, embrac'd, and left the weeping fair.</L>
<L>With love embolden'd, up the virgin rose,</L>
<L>From her soft breast the native woman throws;</L>
<L>And with the gallant warrior clothes the wife,</L>
<L>Following her HACO to the bloody strife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She sought her love thro' war's destructive path,</L>
<L>And often turn'd from him the hand of death.</L>
<L>The chief, attentive, all the youth survey'd,</L>
<L>And in the warrior found the lovely maid.</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="39"/>
She leans, inclining, on her martial spear,</L>
<L>And only for the youth employs her fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The valiant SCOT assails the oaken wall:</L>
<L>The bulwark groans, the brave defenders fall.</L>
<L>With sounding steel the firm barrier he ply'd,</L>
<L>And pour'd his warriors in on ev'ry side.</L>
<L>The godlike HACO rushing thro' the night,</L>
<L>Now here, now there oppos'd th' invaders might,</L>
<L>To ev'ry corner gave divided aid,</L>
<L>Still, still supported by the martial maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when the ocean, swelling o'er the strand,</L>
<L>Invades with billowy troops the subject land;</L>
<L>The sed'lous swains the earthen weight oppose,</L>
<L>And fill the fissures where the tempest flows.</L>
<L>So valiant HACO flew to ev'ry side,</L>
<L>And stemm'd with pointed steel the manly tide;</L>
<L>With great effort preserv'd the narrow field,</L>
<L>And 'twixt the fair and danger kept the shield.</L>
<L>She, only she, employs the Hero's care;</L>
<L>HACO forgot, he only thinks on her.</L>
<L>He longs to sink with glory to the dead,</L>
<L>But can he leave in grief the captive maid?</L>
<L>Her dying image hags his fancy's eyes,</L>
<L>What shou'd he do, if fair AUSELIA dies?</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="40"/>
Love, mighty love, arrested all his pow'r;</L>
<L>He wish'd for flight who never fled before.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as the lioness, to save her young,</L>
<L>Despises death, and meets the hunter-throng;</L>
<L>So, starting from the sable maze of care,</L>
<L>He faces death, and shields the lovely fair.</L>
<L>The martial maid with equal love possest</L>
<L>Wou'd dart 'twixt danger and her HACO's breast;</L>
<L>Oppose her buckler to the listed spear,</L>
<L>And turn from him the iron hand of war.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now godlike AIPIN hew'd his bloody path</L>
<L>Thro' DANISH ranks, and mark'd his steps with death.</L>
<L>Th' inclosed square with desp'rate hand he shears,</L>
<L>And reaps a bloody field of men and spears.</L>
<L>Groans, crashing steel, and clangour of the fight,</L>
<L>Increase the stormy chorus of the night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The DANES, diminish'd, meet th' unequal war,</L>
<L>Where two fall'n oaks confine an inner square:</L>
<L>Join their broad shields, the close-wedg'd column rear,</L>
<L>And on the SCOTTISH battle turn the spear.</L>
<L>On ev'ry side the CALEDONIANS close,</L>
<L>Hemming the desp'rate phalanx of the foes,</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="41"/>
To give the final stroke to battle, croud:</L>
<L>While HACO thus bespoke the DANES aloud;</L>
<L>"Ye sons of North, unfortunate, tho' brave!</L>
<L>Here fate has marked out our common grave;</L>
<L>Has doom'd our bodies to enrich these plains:</L>
<L>Then die reveng'd—like warriors and like DANES!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spoke, and turning to the martial maid,</L>
<L>Embrac'd her softly, and thus, sighing, said;</L>
<L>"Shall then my spouse, my love, my only joy,</L>
<L>Shall fair AURELIA with her HACO die!</L>
<L>Thy death afflicts me.—I in vain complain;</L>
<L>I'll save AURELLA, or expire—a DANE!"</L>
<L>He said, and gath'ring up his spacious shield</L>
<L>Prepar'd to meet the battle in the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young ALPIN heard.—It touch'd his feeling breast,</L>
<L>He stopt the war, and thus the DANE addrest.</L>
<L>"Our CALEDONIA, now reliev'd of fear,</L>
<L>Feels pity rising in the place of care;</L>
<L>Disdains to tyrannize o'er vanquish'd foes,</L>

<L>I now disiniss brave HACO from the field,</L>

<L><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
He said:—his thanks returns the royal DANE,</L>
<L>Himself escorts them to the sounding main.</L>

<L>A ship escap'd the flame, within a bay,</L>

<HEAD>CANTO IV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE sprightly morn with early blushes spread,</L>
<L>Rears o'er the eastern hills her rosy head;</L>
<L>The storm subsides, the breezes as they pass</L>
<L>Sigh on their way along the pearly grass.</L>
<L>Sweet carol all the songsters of the spray,</L>
<L>Calm and serene comes on the gentle day,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amidst attendant fair CULENA moves,</L>
<L>CULENA, fruit of INDULPH's nuptial loves!</L>
<L>Too soon to fate the beauteous queen resign'd,</L>
<L>But left the image of herself behind.</L>
<L>To the calm main the lovely nymphs repair,</L>
<L>To breathe along the strand the morning air;</L>
<L>They brush with easy steps the dewy grass</L>
<L>Observing beauteous nature as they pass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' imperial maid moves with superior grace,</L>
<L>Awe mix'd with mildness sat upon her face;</L>
<L>High inbred virtue all her bosom warms,</L>
<L>In beauty rises, and improves her charms.</L>
<L>Silent and slow she moves along the main,</L>
<L>Behind, her maids attend, a modest train!</L>
<L>Observe her as she moves with native state,</L>
<L>And gather all their motions from her gait.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
<L>Thus thro' IDALIA's balm-distilling grove,</L>
<L>Majestic moves the smiling Queen of Love:</L>
<L>Her hair flows down her snowy neck behind,</L>
<L>Her purple mantle floats upon the wind;</L>
<L>The Graces move along, a blooming train!</L>
<L>And borrow all the gestures of their queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus steal the lovely maids their tardy way</L>
<L>Along the silent border of the sea.</L>
<L>Slow-curling waves advance upon the main,</L>
<L>And often threat the shore, and oft abstain.</L>
<L>A woody mound, which rear'd aloft its head,</L>
<L>Threw trembling shadows o'er a narrow mead:</L>
<L>From a black rock crystalline waters leap,</L>
<L>Arch as they fall, and thro' the valley creep,</L>
<L>Chide with the murm'ring pebbles as they pass,</L>
<L>Or hum their purling journey thro' the grass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pleas'd with the scene the wand'ring virgins stood;</L>
<L>The main below, above the lofty wood.</L>
<L>Their eyes they sate with the transporting scene,</L>
<L>And, sitting, press the fair-enamel'd green;</L>
<L>Enjoy with innocence the growing day,</L>
<L>And steal with harmless talk the time away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mean time fierce CORBRED, who preferr'd in vain</L>
<L>His suit to AGNES, fairest of the train;</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
Who fled from TWEED to shun his hated arms,</L>
<L>Intrusting fair CULENA with her charms;</L>
<L>Saw the disdainful nymph remote from aid,</L>
<L>And bent his lustful eyes upon the maid.</L>
<L>He rush'd with headlong russians from the wood,</L>
<L>And seiz'd the fair: the virgins shriek aloud.</L>
<L>For help, for help! the struggling virgin cries,</L>
<L>And as she shrieks, aloud the wood replies.</L>
<L>ALPIN along,—his men were sent before,</L>
<L>Stalk'd on his thoughtful way along the shore.</L>
<L>The distant plaint assail'd the Hero's ear,</L>
<L>He drew his sword and rush'd to save the fair.</L>
<L>Before the chief the dastard CORBRED fled,</L>
<L>And to her brave preserver left the maid.</L>
<L>Prostrate on earth the lovely virgin lay,</L>
<L>Her roses fade, and all her charms decay:</L>
<L>In humid rest her bending eye-lids close;</L>
<L>With slow returns her bosom fell and rose:</L>
<L>At length returning life her bosom warms,</L>
<L>Glows in her cheeks, and lights up all her charms,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when invading clouds the moon assail,</L>
<L>The landskip fails, and fades the shining vale;</L>
<L>But soon as CYNTHIA rushes on the sight,</L>
<L>Reviving fields are silver'd o'er with light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
<L>Th' affrighted fair the gallant warrior leads</L>
<L>To join, upon the sand, the flying maids.</L>
<L>They croud their cautious steps along the sea,</L>
<L>Quake at each breath, and tremble on their way;</L>
<L>Their tim'rous breasts unsettl'd from surprize,</L>
<L>To ev'ry side they dart their careful eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus on the heathy wild the hunted deer</L>
<L>Start at each blast, together croud thro' fear;</L>
<L>Tremble and look about, before, behind,</L>
<L>Then stretch along, and leave the mountain-wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The gallant youth presents the rescu'd fair,</L>
<L>Confirms their trembling breasts, removes their care;</L>
<L>The gen'rous story from herself they hear,</L>
<L>And drink his praises with a greedy ear;</L>
<L>Steal on the youth their eyes as AGNES spoke,</L>
<L>And pour their flutt'ring souls at ev'ry look.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But fair CULENA feels a keener dart,</L>
<L>It pierc'd her breast and sunk into her heart;</L>
<L>She hears attentive, views, admires and loves,</L>
<L>Her eye o'er all the man with pleasure roves.</L>
<L>With painsul joy she feels the flame increase,</L>
<L>Her pride denies it, but her eyes confess:</L>
<L>She starts, and blushing turns her eye aside,</L>
<L>But love steps in, and steals a look from pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="48" REF="47"/>
<L>Thus fair CULENA struggles up the stream,</L>
<L>And 'tempts in vain to quench the rising flame.</L>
<L>At length, with blushing cheek and bending look,</L>
<L>Th' imperial maid the warrior thus bespoke.</L>
<L>"O gen'rous chief! for thus your deeds wou'd say,</L>
<L>How shall our gratitude thy kindness pay?</L>
<L>INDULPH shall hear, and INDULPH shall reward;</L>
<L>Such gen'rous actions claim a king's regard."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She said: and thus the chief;—"Imperial maid,</L>
<L>More than the debt thy approbation paid.</L>
<L>In this I did not strive with gallant men,</L>
<L>Or drive disorder'd squadrons from the plain;</L>
<L>But frighted from his prey a sensual slave,</L>
<L>The gloomy sons of guilt are never brave.</L>
<L>Whoe'er wou'd seize on a defenceless fair,</L>
<L>Wou'd shun the sword and fly amain from war."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and stalk'd away with manly state,</L>
<L>Grandeur, with awe commix'd, inform'd his gait,</L>
<L>His pond'rous mail reflects the trembling day,</L>
<L>And all his armour rings along the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The royal maid observes him as he flies,</L>
<L>In silence stands, and from her bosom sighs,</L>
<L>Slowly moves on before the silent fair,</L>
<L>And in the palace shuts her secret care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="49" REF="48"/>
<L>Mean time young Alpin seeks the king and peers;</L>
<L>But fair Culena in his bosom bears.</L>
<L>In vain against the rising flame he strove,</L>
<L>For all the man dissolv'd at once to love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Within the high-arch'd hall the nobles sat,</L>
<L>And form'd in council the reviving state;</L>
<L>For instant peace solicitous prepare,</L>
<L>And raise a bulwark 'gainst the future war.</L>
<L>No high-flown zeal the patriot hurl'd along,</L>
<L>No secret gold engag'd the speaker's tongue,</L>
<L>No jarring seeds are by a tyrant sown,</L>
<L>Nor cunning senate undermines the throne.</L>
<L>To public good their public thoughts repair,</L>
<L>And CALEDONIA is the gen'ral care.</L>
<L>No orator in pompous phrases shines,</L>
<L>Or veils with public weal his base designs.</L>
<L>Truth stood conspicuous, undisguis'd by art,</L>
<L>They spoke the homely language of the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Arriv'd the gallant warrior of the night;</L>
<L>They hear with eager joy the gloomy fight.</L>
<L>His conduct, courage, and compassion raise,</L>
<L>And ev'ry voice is forward in his praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The great DUMBAR his awsul stature rears,</L>
<L>His temples whiten'd with the snow of years.</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="49"/>
On the brave youth he bends his solemn look,</L>
<L>Then, turning round, thus to the nobles spoke.</L>
<L>"Beneath the royal banner, SCOTS asar</L>
<L>Had urg'd on Humber's banks the foreign war;</L>
<L>My father dead, tho' young I took the shield,</L>
<L>And led my kindred-warriors to the field.</L>
<L>The noble CALEDONIAN camp was laid</L>
<L>Within the bosom of a spacious mead.</L>
<L>Green-rising hills encompass'd it around,</L>
<L>And these king Malcolm with his archers crown'd;</L>
<L>Full on the right a spacious wood arose,</L>
<L>And thither night convey'd a band of foes.</L>
<L>The king-commands a chief to clear the wood,</L>
<L>And I the dang'rous service claim aloud.</L>
<L>I went, expell'd the foes, and kill'd their lord,</L>
<L>And ever since have worn his shining sword.</L>
<L>I now retire from war, in age to rest;</L>
<L>Take it brave youth; for you can wield it best."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and reach'd the sword.—The youth reply'd,</L>
<L>Shooting the heavy blade athwart his side,</L>
<L>"My lord with gratitude this sword I take,</L>
<L>Esteem the present for the giver's sake.</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="50"/>
It still may find the way it oft explor'd,</L>
<L>And glut with hostile blood its second lord;</L>
<L>To bloody honour hew its wasteful path,</L>
<L>A faithful sickle in the fields of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thus.—With placid mein great INDULPH rose,</L>
<L>And spoke; "Thus always meet our Albion's foes;</L>
<L>With foreign blood your native arms adorn,</L>
<L>And boldly fight for ages yet unborn.</L>
<L>For us, my lords, fought all our godlike sires;</L>
<L>The debt we owe to them, our race requires:</L>
<L>Tho' future arms our country should enslave,</L>
<L>She shall acquit our ashes in the grave;</L>
<L>Posterity degen'rate, as they groan,</L>
<L>Shall bless their sires, and call their woes their own.</L>
<L>Let us, my lords, each virt'ous spark inspire,</L>
<L>And where we find it, blow it to a fire.</L>
<L>Thy service, gallant ALPIN, in this war,</L>
<L>Shall both be INDULPH's and the senate's care,</L>
<L>Mean time, with manly sports and exercise</L>
<L>Let us from bus'ness turn the mental eyes:</L>
<L>The mind relax'd acquires a double force,</L>
<L>And with new vigour finishes the course."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He added not: the godlike chiefs obey;</L>
<L>All rise at once; great INDULPH leads the way.</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="51"/>
The palace here, and there a virid mound,</L>
<L>Confine a flow'ry spot of grassy ground.</L>
<L>The under-rock, emerging thro' the green,</L>
<L>Chequers with hoary knobs the various scene.</L>
<L>Thither repair the chiefs and scepter'd king,</L>
<L>And bend upon the plain the hollow ring.</L>
<L>Obedient servants from the palace bear</L>
<L>The horny bow, the helm, the shining spear,</L>
<L>The mail, the corslet, and the brazen shield;</L>
<L>And throw the ringing weight upon the field.</L>
<L>Imperial INDULPH, tow'ring o'er the plain,</L>
<L>With placid words address'd the warrior-train:</L>
<L>"Let those who bend the stubborn bow arise,</L>
<L>And with the feather'd shast dispute this prize;</L>
<L>An antique bow a BALEARIAN wore,</L>
<L>When Romans thunder'd on our ALBION's shore.</L>
<L>The skilful archer, dealing death afar,</L>
<L>Threw on our Scottish host the distant war;</L>
<L>Great FERGUS springs, a king devoid of fear,</L>
<L>And thro' his body shoots the reeking spear;</L>
<L>The bloody spoil thro' striving cohorts brings,</L>
<L>And sends this relique down to after kings."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, grasping the long bow, the monarch said:</L>
<L>Rose valiant Grahame and youthful SOMERLED.</L>
<L><PB N="53" REF="52"/>
Next GOWAL in the strife demands a part,</L>
<L>Fam'd on his native hills to wing the dart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Full on the mound a helm, their aim, was plac'd;</L>
<L>And GOWAL drew the nerve, first, to his breast;</L>
<L>The bow reluctant yields, then backward springs;</L>
<L>The nerve resounds, thro' air the arrow sings.</L>
<L>Close to the aim, the earth the arrow meets,</L>
<L>And as it vibrates the bright helmet beats.</L>
<L>Applause ensues.—The shaft was sent by Grahame,</L>
<L>And cut its brazen journey thro' the aim.</L>
<L>The prize on him the murm'ring chiefs bestow,</L>
<L>Till SOMERLED assumes the antient bow.</L>
<L>The dancing chord the leaping arrow left,</L>
<L>And, rushing, took on end Grahame's birchen shalt;</L>
<L>Tore on its way, around the shivers fly,</L>
<L>And SOMERLED brings off the prize with joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Who," cries the king, "this shield his prize shall bear,</L>
<L>And fling with skilful hand the martial spear?</L>
<L>Behind this buckler mighty KENNETH stood,</L>
<L>When Tay, impurpled, ran with Pictish blood."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said, and plac'd a mark, the knobby round,</L>
<L>And measur'd back with equal steps the ground.</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="53"/>
The valiant Grahame, the Mountain-youth arose;</L>
<L>Gowal again his martial stature shows;</L>
<L>Bent on the knobby splendour of the prize,</L>
<L>First from his hand the singing weapon flies.</L>
<L>The steel-head mark'd a circle as it run,</L>
<L>Flam'd with the splendour of the setting sun.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when the night the weeping sky o'er-veils,</L>
<L>Athwart the gloom the streaming meteor sails,</L>
<L>Kindles a livid circle as it flies,</L>
<L>And with its glory dazzles human eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus flew the spear, and, sinking in the mound,</L>
<L>With quick vibrations beat the air around;</L>
<L>But miss'd the shield.—Grahame's not unpractis'd art</L>
<L>Dismisses thro' the air the murm'ring dart:</L>
<L>Full on the middle boss it takes the shield;</L>
<L>The fighting metals clatter o'er the field:</L>
<L>From the firm knob the point obliquely flies,</L>
<L>And on the field the trembling weapon lies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next valiant ALPIN takes the pond'rous spear,</L>
<L>And, bending back, dismisses it thro' air:</L>
<L>The long, quick weapon, flying o'er the field,</L>
<L>Falls on the boss, and perforates the shield;</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="54"/>
The waving shaft is planted on the mound;</L>
<L>And with applause the neighb'ring rocks resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young SOMERLED wrench'd from the rock a quoit,</L>
<L>A huge, enormous, sharp, unwieldy weight;</L>
<L>Such now-a-days as many panting swains</L>
<L>A witness rear on long-contested plains:</L>
<L>Slow-bending down, at length the hero springs;</L>
<L>The rolling rock along the heavens sings;</L>
<L>Falling, it shakes at once the neighb'ring ground,</L>
<L>And on the face of earth indents a wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus when strong winds the aged tow'r invade,</L>
<L>And throw the shapeless ruin from its head;</L>
<L>It falls and cleaves its bed into the ground;</L>
<L>The valley shakes, and rocks complain around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All try the mark to reach, but try in vain;</L>
<L>All, falling short, unequal wound the plain.</L>
<L>ALPIN with diffidence assumes the stone,</L>
<L>For such a space had SOMERLED o'er thrown:</L>
<L>Th' unwieldy rock a while he weighs with care,</L>
<L>Then, springing, sends it whizzing thro' the air;</L>
<L>The wond'ring warriors view it as it rolls;</L>
<L>Far o'er the distant mark the discus falls:</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="55"/>
It shakes the plain and deals a gaping wound;</L>
<L>Such as when headlong torrents tear the ground.</L>

<L>CULENA, leaning on her snowy arms</L>

<L>The veil of night had now inwrapt the pole;</L>

<L>Great INDULPH rose with favour-speaking mein;</L>

<L>To reap this harvest of unrivall'd fame?</L>
<L>Nobler the youth, who, tho' before unknown,</L>
<L>From merit mounts to virtue and renown,</L>

<LG>
<L>THE Hero, rising from his lofty seat,</L>
<L>Thus unpresumptuously accosts the great:</L>
<L>"The fame of DENMARK pass'd our mountains o'er,</L>
<L>And fill'd our ears on ABRIA's distant shore:</L>
<L>Brave RYNOLD starts:—the aged chief alarms,</L>
<L>And kindles all his family to arms.</L>
<L>A hundred youths, who, from the sounding wood,</L>
<L>Or tow'ring mountain brought their living food,</L>
<L>Obey the bag-pipe's voice; for all, in view</L>
<L>Of RYNOLD's seat, the friendly Canton grew.</L>
<L>The hoary warrior leads the onward path,</L>
<L>No stranger to the road which led to death.</L>
<L>Behind advancing, I, with martial care,</L>
<L>Lead on the youthful thunder-bolts of war;</L>
<L>With arms anticipate the kindling fire,</L>
<L>And move to ev'ry motion of my sire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"On GRAMPUS, night her mantle round us throws;</L>
<L>We slept in heath—the dappled morn arose:</L>
<L>Descending thence pursue our headlong way,</L>
<L>And cross the silver errors of the TAY.</L>
<L>Groans, feeble shrieks, ascending from the vale,</L>
<L>Speak on the pinions of the southern gale.</L>
<L><PB N="58" REF="57"/>
A dismal scene breaks on our distant eyes;</L>
<L>Here one pursues, and there another flies.</L>
<L>This breathes his life thro' the impurpled wound,</L>
<L>While his proud villa smokes along the ground.</L>
<L>That with the foe maintains unequal strife,</L>
<L>While his dear offspring fly, and dearer wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The senior saw it with indignant eyes,</L>
<L>And bid, at once, his kindred-ranks arise.</L>
<L>With hasty steps we seize a virid brow,</L>
<L>And form a sable cloud above the foe.</L>
<L>Thus on the mountain's brow, I oft have seen</L>
<L>The must'ring clouds brew torrents for the plain;</L>
<L>At length the blust'ring south begins to roar,</L>
<L>And heav'n descends impetuous in a show'r;</L>
<L>The bubbling floods foam down the hill, and spread</L>
<L>A swimming deluge on the subject mead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thus RYNOLD formed on the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>And headlong rush'd into the vale below.</L>
<L>While on the banks of TAY terrific shine</L>
<L>The steel-clad foe, and stretch the hostile line.</L>
<L>They form a wall along the flowing flood,</L>
<L>And awful gleam their arms, an iron wood.</L>
<L>We shout, and rush upon the hostile throng:</L>
<L>The echoing fields with iron clangour rung.</L>
<L><PB N="59" REF="58"/>
Firm stood the foe, nor made they flight their care,</L>
<L>But hand to hand return'd the equal war:</L>
<L>Man close to man, and shield conjoin'd to shield,</L>
<L>They with the stable phalanx keep the field.</L>
<L>With pointed spear I mark'd the stoutest foe,</L>
<L>And heav'n directed home the happy blow:</L>
<L>He tumbles backward to the groaning flood:</L>
<L>TAY circles round, and mingles with his blood.</L>
<L>My kindred-youth their useful weapons wield,</L>
<L>Fomenting the confusion of the field.</L>
<L>DANE fell on DANE, and man transfix'd his man,</L>
<L>Till bloody torrents smoak'd along the plain.</L>
<L>At length they fly along the banks of TAY;</L>
<L>Their guilty leader points th' inglorious way.</L>
<L>Eager we follow:—still the foe with art</L>
<L>Wound as they fly, and shoot th' inverted dart.</L>
<L>RYNOLD is wounded.—Still he urg'd the foe;</L>
<L>While down his limbs the crimson torrents flow:</L>
<L>With eager voice he still foments the strife,</L>
<L>Preferring ALBION's liberty to life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"An antient pile uprear'd its rev'rent head,</L>
<L>And from its lofty seat survey'd a mead:</L>
<L>The mould'ring walls confess'd their beauty past;</L>
<L>A fragment falls with each invading blast.</L>
<L><PB N="60" REF="59"/>
Old arms above the gate time's empire own;</L>
<L>The rampant lion moulders in the stone:</L>
<L>Tall elms around, an old and shatter'd band,</L>
<L>Their naked arms erect, like centries stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Within the ruin'd walls their fear inclose</L>
<L>The desp'rate squadrons of the flying foes.</L>
<L>An ancient plane, whose leaf-dismantled weight</L>
<L>Rude winds o'erturn'd, secures the shapeless gate.</L>
<L>On ev'ry side my quick array I form,</L>
<L>Prepar'd at once the muniment to storm.</L>
<L>Missing my sire, I fly to find the chief,</L>
<L>And give the wounded all a son's relief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Far on the plain the wounded warrior creeps,</L>
<L>And scarcely moves along his tott'ring steps;</L>
<L>But still, far as his feeble voice cou'd bear,</L>
<L>He kindles with his words the distant war.</L>
<L>Quick I approach'd:—He first the silence broke;</L>
<L>And leaning on his launce, the warrior spoke."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Say, why returns young ALPIN from the fight?</L>
<L>Pursue the foe, and urge the DANISH flight.</L>
<L>I sink, my son, I sink into the grave;</L>
<L>You cannot me, your country, ALPIN, save."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more he said.—I, mournful, thus reply,</L>
<L>Compassion melting in my filial eye,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="60"/>
O sire, the DANES, within yon walls secur'd,</L>
<L>Will share our pity, or must feel our sword:</L>
<L>Of filial duty what his wants require,</L>
<L>I come to offer for a dying sire."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"He thus returns: still good, still gen'rous mind!</L>
<L>My wants are, ALPIN, of no earthly kind:</L>
<L>The world, the fading world, retires from view;</L>
<L>Earth cloys me now, and all it has, but you.</L>
<L>Go, ALPIN, go; within that lofty wood</L>
<L>A hermit lives, a holy man and good!</L>
<L>Relieve, my son, relieve me of my cares,</L>
<L>And for the dying RYNOLD raise his pray'rs."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thus said;—himself the wounded warrior laid,</L>
<L>Within the coolness of a birchen shade:</L>
<L>Some youths around employ their friendly care,</L>
<L>And o'er the dying shed the mournful tear.</L>
<L>Around the antient fastness guards I sent;</L>
<L>And to the lofty wood my journey bent.</L>
<L>Two rising hills, whose brows tall pop'lars grace,</L>
<L>With stretching arms a woody plain embrace;</L>
<L>Along the tree-set vale a riv'let flow'd,</L>
<L>And murmur'd softly thro' the under-wood:</L>
<L>Along the purling stream my steps I bear,</L>
<L>And seek the lonely mansions of the seer.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="61"/>
Irreg'lar files of tow'ring elms embrace,</L>
<L>In their calm bosom, an enamel'd space.</L>
<L>Full at the end a rock with sable arms,</L>
<L>Stretch'd o'er a moss-grown cave, a grotto forms.</L>
<L>A silver stream, clear-issuing from the stones,</L>
<L>In winding mazes thro' the meadow runs;</L>
<L>Depending flow'rs their vary'd colours bind,</L>
<L>Hang o'er the entrance, and defend the wind.</L>
<L>On a green bank the holy seer is laid,</L>
<L>Where weaving branches cloud the chequer'd shade;</L>
<L>In solemn thought his hoary head's inclin'd,</L>
<L>And his white locks wave in the fanning wind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"With rev'rent steps approaching, I began.</L>
<L>"O blest with all that dignifies the man!</L>
<L>Who far from life, and all its noisy care,</L>
<L>Enjoy'st the aim of all that wander there:</L>
<L>Let, holy father, thy propitious aid</L>
<L>Guide dying RYNOLD thro' the deathful shade."</L>
<L>I said:—the prophet heav'n-ward lifts his eyes,</L>
<L>Long fix'd in solemn thought, and thus replies;</L>
<L>"Vain mortals! worms of earth! How can ye dare</L>
<L>To deem your deeds not providence's care?</L>
<L>Heav'n looks on all below with equal eye:</L>
<L>They long escape, but yet the wicked die.</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="62"/>
With distant time, O youth! my soul's imprest;</L>
<L>Futurity is lab'ring in my breast:</L>
<L>Thy blood, which rolling down from FERGUS came,</L>
<L>Passes thro' time, a pure untained stream.</L>
<L>ALBION shall in her pristine glory shine,</L>
<L>And, blest herself, bless the FERGUSIAN line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But ah! I see grim treason rear its head,</L>
<L>Pale ALBION trembling, and her monarch dead;</L>
<L>The tyrant wield his scepter 'smear'd with blood;</L>
<L>O base return! but still great heav'n is good:</L>
<L>He falls, he falls: see how the tyrant lies!</L>
<L>And SCOTLAND brightens up her weeping eyes:</L>
<L>The banish'd race, again, resume their own;</L>
<L>Nor SYRIA boasts her royal saint alone.</L>
<L>Its gloomy front the low'ring season clears,</L>
<L>And gently rolls a happy round of years.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Again I see contending chiefs come on,</L>
<L>And, as they strive to mount, they tear the throne;</L>
<L>To civil arms the horrid trumpet calls,</L>
<L>And CALEDONIA by her children falls.</L>
<L>The storm subsides to the calm flood of peace;</L>
<L>The throne returns to FERGUS' antient race.</L>
<L>Glad CALEDONIA owns their lawful sway;</L>
<L>Happy in them, in her unhappy they!</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="63"/>
See each inwrapt untimely in his shroud,</L>
<L>For ever sleeping in his gen'rous blood!</L>
<L>Who on thy mournful tomb refrains the tear?</L>
<L>O regal charms, unfortunately fair!</L>
<L>Dark FACTION grasps her in his sable arms,</L>
<L>And crushes down to death her struggling charms;</L>
<L>The rose, in all its gaudy liv'ry drest,</L>
<L>Thus faintly struggles with the blust'ring west.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Why mention him in whom th' eternal fates</L>
<L>Shall bind in peace the long-discording states?</L>
<L>See SCOT and SAXON coalesc'd in one,</L>
<L>Support the glory of the common crown.</L>
<L>BRITAIN no more shall shake with native storms,</L>
<L>But o'er the trembling nations lift her arms."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He spoke, and in the cave inclos'd his age:</L>
<L>In wonder lost I leave the hermitage;</L>
<L>Measure with thoughtful steps my backward way,</L>
<L>While to the womb of night retires the day.</L>
<L>Pale doubtful twilight broods along the ground:</L>
<L>The forest nods its sleeping head around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before my eyes a ghastly vision stood;</L>
<L>A mangled man, his bosom stain'd with blood!</L>
<L>Silent and sad the phantom stood confest,</L>
<L>And shew'd the streaming flood-gates of his breast.</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="64"/>
Then pointing to the Dome his tardy hand,</L>
<L>Thither his eyes my silent way command.</L>
<L>He hands my sword, emits a feeble groan,</L>
<L>And weakly says, "revenge me, O my son!"</L>
<L>I to reply—he hiss'd his way along,</L>
<L>As breezes sing thro' reeds their shrilly song.</L>
<L>I stood aghast, then wing'd me to obey;</L>
<L>Across the field I sweep my hasty way.</L>
<L>The men I arm;—the firm barrier we ply;</L>
<L>And those who dare dispute the passage die.</L>
<L>With dying groans the lonely walls resound:</L>
<L>I on the guilty leader deal a wound;</L>
<L>Thro' his bright helm the sword its journey takes;</L>
<L>He falls, and thus with dying accents speaks:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Just heav'n! in vain the wicked shun thy pow'r;</L>
<L>Tho' late thy vengeance, yet the blow is sure.</L>
<L>This earth receiv'd the blood from off my hands;</L>
<L>A just return, my own, my own demands!</L>
<L>In night's dead hour, when all, but treason, slept,</L>
<L>With ruffian bands, a bloody train, I crept.</L>
<L>'Twas here, 'twas here, oh! long-deserved death!</L>
<L>'Twas here the godlike man resign'd his breath:</L>
<L>The sleeping fam'ly we with blood surprize,</L>
<L>And send the palace flaming to the skies.</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="65"/>
I fled, but fled, alas! pursued by fate;</L>
<L>'Tis now I find that I have sinn'd too late.</L>
<L>O MALCOLM! O my king! before my eyes</L>
<L>He stands confest;—accurst DOVALUS dies."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His guilty soul in these dire accents fled,</L>
<L>I left with hasty steps the silent dead.</L>
<L>Beneath the birch my aged sire I found;</L>
<L>His life was ebbing thro' the purple wound.</L>
<L>On me the aged senior lifts his eyes,</L>
<L>And mixes feeble accents with his sighs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"ALPIN, the commerce of this world I leave,</L>
<L>Convey my reliques to my father's grave.</L>
<L>Ten friendly youths the homely rites shall pay;</L>
<L>Lead thou the rest, my ALPIN, to the fray:</L>
<L>DENMARK invades:—this was a pilf'ring band,</L>
<L>Who spread divided terror o'er the land."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said: a qualm succeeds; tears fill my eyes,</L>
<L>And woe, securely, shuts the gates of voice;</L>
<L>Silent and sad I hang the dying o'er,</L>
<L>And with warm tears intenerate his gore."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The chief resumes:—"my brave, my only son!</L>
<L>Yes, ALPIN, I may call thee all my own;</L>
<L>I shall not veil a secret in my death;</L>
<L>Take then this story of my latest breath:</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="66"/>
The twentieth season liv'ries o'er the year,</L>
<L>Since on the SEVERN's banks I met the war;</L>
<L>In private feud, against a SAXON lord,</L>
<L>The great DUMBAR had rais'd his kindred-sword:</L>
<L>I on the foe my bow auxiliar bend,</L>
<L>And join afar our fam'ly's antient friend:</L>
<L>Returning thence I next the TAY divide,</L>
<L>That very night the great King MALCOLM dy'd.</L>
<L>My clan in arms might then preserve their king;</L>
<L>But Fate withstood;—along in arms we ring.</L>
<L>An infant's cries, at distance, took my ear,</L>
<L>I went, found thee, a helpless orphan there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The king, who long infix'd in dumb surprize,</L>
<L>Run o'er the speaking youth with searching eyes,</L>
<L>Here stopt him short, his arms around him flung,</L>
<L>And silent on th' astonish'd warrior hung;</L>
<L>My son, my son! at last, perplex'd, he cries,</L>
<L>My DUFFUS!—tears hung in his joyful eyes:</L>
<L>The crouding tide of joy his words suppress'd;</L>
<L>He clasps the youth, in silence, to his breast.</L>
<L>Th' astonish'd chiefs, congeal'd in dumb amaze,</L>
<L>Stiffen'd to silence, on each other gaze.</L>
<L>Sudden their cheeks are vary'd with surprize,</L>
<L>And glad disorder darted from their eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
<L>As when before the swains, with instant sound,</L>
<L>The forky bolt descending tears the ground;</L>
<L>They stand; with stupid gaze each other eye:</L>
<L>So stood the chiefs oppress'd with sudden joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, relax'd from fetters of surprize,</L>
<L>"Welcome, brave youth!" the scepter'd senior cries,</L>
<L>"Welcome to honours justly thine alone,</L>
<L>Triumphant mount, tho' late, thy father's throne</L>
<L>To thee with joy the scepter I resign,</L>
<L>And waft the kingdom to the coming line."</L>
<L>He said: and thus the youth; "I only know</L>
<L>To shoot the spear, and bend the stubborn bow;</L>
<L>Unskill'd to stretch o'er nations my command,</L>
<L>Or in the scales of judgment poise a land.</L>
<L>Wield still the scepter which with grace you wear,</L>
<L>And guide with steadier hand the regal car;</L>
<L>While, looking up to thee with humble eye,</L>
<L>I first transcribe my future rules of sway;</L>
<L>Till late enjoy the throne which you bequeath,</L>
<L>And only date dominion from thy death."</L>
<L>Resolv'd he spoke:—bursts of applause around</L>
<L>Break on the chief:—with joy the halls resound.</L>
<L>As when some valiant youth returns from far,</L>
<L>And leaves the fields of death, and finish'd war;</L>
<L><PB N="69" REF="68"/>
Whom time and honest scars another made,</L>
<L>And friendly hope long plac'd among the dead;</L>
<L>At first his sire looks with indifference on,</L>
<L>But soon he knows, and hangs upon his son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So all the chiefs the royal youth embrace;</L>
<L>While joys, tumultuous, rend the lofty place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thus the king, and noble chiefs rejoice,</L>
<L>Harmonious bards exalt the tuneful voice:</L>
<L>A select band by INDULPH's bounty fed,</L>
<L>To keep in song the mem'ry of the dead!</L>
<L>They handed down the ancient rounds of time,</L>
<L>In oral story and recorded rhyme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The vocal quire in tuneful concert sings</L>
<L>Exploits of heroes, and of antient kings:</L>
<L>How first in FERGUS CALEDONIA rose;</L>
<L>What hosts she conquer'd, and repell'd what foes.</L>
<L>Thro' time in reg'lar series they decline,</L>
<L>And touch each name of the FERGUSIAN line;</L>
<L>Great CARACTACUS, FERGUS' awful sword;</L>
<L>That bravely lost his country, this restor'd:</L>
<L>HIBERNIA's spoils, GREGORIUS' martial fire;</L>
<L>The stern avenger of his murder'd sire:</L>
<L>Beneath his sword, as yet, whole armies groan,</L>
<L>And a whole nation paid the blood of ONE.</L>
<L><PB N="70" REF="69"/>
At length descend the rough impetuous strains</L>
<L>To valiant DUFFUS, and the slaughter'd DANES:</L>
<L>The battle lives in verse; in song they wound;</L>
<L>And falling squadrons thunder on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, in the strain, the bards impetuous roll,</L>
<L>And quaff the gen'rous spirit of the bowl;</L>
<L>At length from the elab'rate song respire;</L>
<L>The chiefs remove, and all to rest retire.</L>

<HEAD>CANTO VI.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>NOW, in the blushing east, the morn arose;</L>
<L>Its lofty head, in grey, the palace shows.</L>
<L>Within, the king and valiant chiefs prepare</L>
<L>To urge the chace, and wage the mountain-war.</L>
<L>The busy menials thro' the palace go;</L>
<L>Some whet the shaft, and others try the bow;</L>
<L>This view'd the toils; that taught the horn to sound;</L>
<L>Another animates the sprightly hound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For the fleet chace the fair CULENA arms,</L>
<L>And from the gloom of sorrow'wakes her charms:</L>
<L>The Hero's royal birth had reach'd her ear,</L>
<L>And sprightly hope assum'd the throne of care:</L>
<L>Around her slender waist the cincture slides;</L>
<L>Her mantle flows behind in crimson tides.</L>
<L>Bright rings of gold her braided ringlets bind;</L>
<L>The rattling quiver, laden, hangs behind.</L>
<L>She seiz'd, with snowy hand, the polish'd bow,</L>
<L>And mov'd before, majestically slow.</L>
<L>The chiefs behind advance their sable forms;</L>
<L>And with dark contrast heighten all her charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, on expanded plains of heavenly blue,</L>
<L>Thick-gather'd clouds the queen of night pursue;</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="71"/>
And as they croud behind their sable lines,</L>
<L>The virgin-light with double lustre shines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The maid her glowing charms thus onward bears;</L>
<L>His manly height, aside, young DUFFUS rears.</L>
<L>Her beauty he, his manhood she admires;</L>
<L>Both mov'd along, and fed their silent fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The HUNTERS to the lofty mountains came:</L>
<L>Their eager breasts anticipate the game:</L>
<L>The forest they divide, and sound the horn;</L>
<L>The gen'rous hounds within their bondage burn:</L>
<L>Struggle for freedom, long to stretch away,</L>
<L>And in the wind already scent the prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At the approaching noise the starting deer</L>
<L>Croud on the heath, and stretch away in fear;</L>
<L>Wave, as they spring, their branchy heads on high,</L>
<L>Skim o'er the wild, and leave the aching eye.</L>
<L>The eager hounds, unchain'd, devour the heath;</L>
<L>They shoot along, and pant a living death:</L>
<L>Gaining upon their journey, as they dart,</L>
<L>Each from the herd selects a flying hart.</L>
<L>Some urg'd the bounding stag a different way,</L>
<L>And hung with open mouth upon the prey:</L>
<L>Now they traverse the heath, and now assail</L>
<L>The rising hill, now skim along the vale:</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="72"/>
Now they appear, now leave the aching eyes,</L>
<L>The master follows with exulting cries;</L>
<L>Fits, as he flies, the arrow to the string;</L>
<L>The rest within the rattling quiver ring:</L>
<L>He, as they shoot the lofty mountains o'er,</L>
<L>Pursues in thought, and sends his soul before.</L>
<L>Thus they with supple joints the chace pursue,</L>
<L>Rise on the hills, and vanish on the brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On the blue heav'ns arose a night of clouds;</L>
<L>The radiant lord of day his glory shrouds:</L>
<L>The rushing whirlwind speaks with growling breath,</L>
<L>Roars thro' the hill, and scours along the heath:</L>
<L>Deep rolling thunder, rumbling from afar,</L>
<L>Proclaims with murm'ring voice th' aerial war:</L>
<L>Fleet light'nings flash in lawful streams of light,</L>
<L>Dart thro' the gloom, and vanish from the sight:</L>
<L>The blust'ring winds thro' heav'ns black concave sound,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rain batters earth, and smokes along the ground.</L>
<L>Down the steep hill the rushing torrents run,</L>
<L>And cleave with headlong rage their journey on;</L>
<L>The lofty mountains echo to the fall;</L>
<L>A muddy deluge stagnates on the vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
<L>CULENA mov'd a long the level ground;</L>
<L>A hart descends before the op'ning hound:</L>
<L>From the recoiling chord she twang'd the dart,</L>
<L>And pierc'd the living vigour of the hart:</L>
<L>He starts, he springs; but falling as he flies,</L>
<L>Pours out his tim'rous soul with weeping eyes.</L>
<L>As o'er the dying prey the huntress sigh'd,</L>
<L>Before the wind heav'n pours a sable tide,</L>
<L>And lowring threats a storm: A rocky cave,</L>
<L>Where monks successive hew'd their house and grave,</L>
<L>Invites into its calm recess the fair:</L>
<L>The rev'rend father breath'd abroad his pray'r.</L>
<L>The valiant DUFFUS comes with panting breath,</L>
<L>Faces the storm, and stalks across the heath.</L>
<L>His sleeky hounds, a faithful tribe, before,</L>
<L>Are bath'd with blood, and vary'd o'er with gore.</L>
<L>Drench'd with the rain, the noble youth descends,</L>
<L>And, in the cave, the growling storm defends.</L>
<L>Amaz'd, astonish'd, fix'd in dumb surprize,</L>
<L>The lovers stood, but spoke with silent eyes:</L>
<L>At length the distant colloquy they rear,</L>
<L>Run o'er the chace, the mountain, and the deer.</L>
<L><PB N="75" REF="74"/>
Far from the soul th' evasive tongue departs,</L>
<L>Their eyes are only faithful to their hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The winding volumes of discourse return,</L>
<L>To hostile fields by gallant DUFFUS shorn.</L>
<L>Th'imperial maid must hear it o'er again,</L>
<L>How fell DOVALUS was by DUFFUS slain:</L>
<L>How, by the son, the father's murd'rer fell.</L>
<L>The kindling virgin flames along the tale.</L>
<L>She turns, she quakes, and from her bosom sighs,</L>
<L>And all her soul comes melting in her eyes.</L>
<L>Flames, not unequal, all the youth possess,</L>
<L>He, for the first, hears willingly his praise.</L>
<L>Praise, harshly heard from warriors, kings and lords,</L>
<L>Came down in balm on fair CULENA's words.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The royal pair thus fed the mutual fire,</L>
<L>Now speak, now pause, when both alike admire.</L>
<L>He longs to vent the passion of his soul,</L>
<L>And she the tempests in her bosom roll.</L>
<L>Now he begun; but shame his voice opprest;</L>
<L>Loth to offend, his eyes must tell the rest.</L>
<L>At length, upon the headlong passion born,</L>
<L>He spoke his love, and had a kind return;</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="75"/>
She sigh'd, she own'd, and bent her modest eyes,</L>
<L>While blushing roses on her cheeks arise.</L>
<L>Thus, on the vale, the poppy's blushing head,</L>
<L>Brimful of summer-show'rs to earth is weigh'd,</L>
<L>Fann'd with the rising breeze it slow inclines,</L>
<L>While o'er the mead the rosy lustre shines.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>INDULPH into his cave the hermit led,</L>
<L>Found erring thro' the mountains stormy head.</L>
<L>CULENA, starting as the king appears,</L>
<L>Looks ev'ry way, and trembles as she fears:</L>
<L>On her mild face the modest blushes rise,</L>
<L>And fair disorder darted from her eyes.</L>
<L>The parent-king observ'd the virgin whole,</L>
<L>And read the harmless secret in her soul.</L>
<L>A while the maze of calm discourse they wind;</L>
<L>At length the king unveils his royal mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Warded from ALBION's head the storm is o'er;</L>
<L>Her prince is found, her foes are now no more:</L>
<L>Thro' time 'tis ours her happiness to trace;</L>
<L>'Tis ours to bind the future bands of peace.</L>
<L>Posterity for ALBION's crown may fight,</L>
<L>And couch ambition in the name of right;</L>
<L>With specious titles urge the civil war,</L>
<L>And to a crown their guilty journey tear:</L>
<L><PB N="77" REF="76"/>
I end these fears:—the streams shall run in one;</L>
<L>Nor struggling kindred strive to mount the throne.</L>
<L>I shield my daughter with young DUFFUS' arms,</L>
<L>And bless the warrior with CULENA's charms."</L>
<L>Thus said the king. Their willing hands they join:</L>
<L>The rev'rent priest runs o'er the rites divine.</L>
<L>The solemn ceremony clos'd with pray'r;</L>
<L>And DUFFUS call'd his own the royal fair.</L>
<L>The storm is ceas'd: the clouds together fly,</L>
<L>And clear, at once, the azure fields of sky:</L>
<L>The mid-day sun pours down his sultry slame,</L>
<L>And the wet heath waves glist'ring in the bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hunter chiefs appear upon the brow,</L>
<L>Fall down the hill, and join the king below:</L>
<L>Slow, thro' the narrow vale, their steps they bear;</L>
<L>Behind advance the spoils of Sylvan war.</L>
<L>Far on a head-land point condens'd they stood,</L>
<L>And threw their eyes o'er ocean's sable flood;</L>
<L>Tall ships advance afar: their canvas-sails</L>
<L>In their swoln bosom gather all the gales;</L>
<L>Floating along the sable back of sea,</L>
<L>Before the wind they cut their spumy way;</L>
<L>Bend in their course, majestically slow,</L>
<L>And to the land their lazy journey plow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
<L>Thus spungy clouds on heav'n's blue vault arise,</L>
<L>And float, before the wind, along the skies;</L>
<L>Their wings oppos'd to the illustrious sun,</L>
<L>Shine, as they move, majestically on.</L>
<L>Thus godlike HAROLD brought his sloating aid,</L>
<L>Unknowing SUENO's number'd with the dead.</L>
<L>From ANGLIA's coasts he call'd his troops afar,</L>
<L>To aid his brother in the foreign war.</L>
<L>Arriv'd, he in the wave the anchor throws,</L>
<L>Attempts to land, and ALEION's chiefs oppose;</L>
<L>Wave on the fatal shore the pointed spear,</L>
<L>And send the arrow whizzing thro' the air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The DANES return the flying death afar,</L>
<L>And, as they croud away, maintain the war.</L>
<L>An arrow tore thro' air its murm'ring path,</L>
<L>Fell on the king, and weigh'd him down to death:</L>
<L>Quick, from the wound, the blood tumult'ous sprung,</L>
<L>And o'er the sand the recking weapon flung:</L>
<L>Prone on the strand, an awful trunk he lies,</L>
<L>While sleep eternal steals upon his eyes.</L>
<L>The mournful chiefs around the dying stood,</L>
<L>Some raise the body, others stem the blood:</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="78"/>
In vain their care;—the soul for ever fled,</L>
<L>And fate had number'd INDULPH with the dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>CULENA, whom young DUFFUS set apart,</L>
<L>With a green bank secur'd the hostile dart.</L>
<L>Her father's fate assail'd her tender ear,</L>
<L>She beat her snowy breast, and tore her hair:</L>
<L>Frantic along the sand she run, she flew,</L>
<L>And on the corse distressful beauty threw:</L>
<L>She call'd her father's shade with filial cries,</L>
<L>And all the daughter streaming from her eyes.</L>
<L>Bent on revenge the furious DUFFUS strode,</L>
<L>And ey'd, with angry look, the sable flood.</L>
<L>A ship, which near had took its nodding stand,</L>
<L>Fix'd with the pitchy haulser to the strand,</L>
<L>Remains of SUENO's fleet, the Hero view'd,</L>
<L>And to the mournful warriors spoke aloud:</L>
<L>"Let these whose actions are enchain'd by years</L>
<L>Honour the mighty dead with friendly tears;</L>
<L>While we of youth, descending to the main,</L>
<L>Exact severe atonement of the DANE."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thus: and rushing thro' the billowy roars,</L>
<L>With brawny arms his rapid journey oars</L>
<L>Divides with rolling chest the ridgy sea,</L>
<L>Lashing the bubbling liquid in his way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
<L>The boat he seiz'd, and, meas'ring back the deep,</L>
<L>Wafted his brave companions to the ship;</L>
<L>The haulser broke, unfurl'd the swelling sail,</L>
<L>And caught the vig'rous spirit of the gale:</L>
<L>Before the sable prow the ocean parts,</L>
<L>And groans beneath the vessel as it darts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now on the foe the SCOTTISH warriors gain;</L>
<L>Swells on the approaching eye the floating DANE,</L>
<L>Fierce ULRIC's skill brought up the lazy rear,</L>
<L>Fam'd in the fields of main to urge the war.</L>
<L>Twice seven years, in base pursuit of gain;</L>
<L>He plow'd the waves, the common foe of men;</L>
<L>At last to HAROLD aiding arms he join'd;</L>
<L>Grasping the spoil with avaricious mind.</L>
<L>At first he shoots the leaping shaft afar,</L>
<L>And manages with skill the distant war.</L>
<L>The chiefs of ALBION with collected might,</L>
<L>Bear on the foe, and close the naval fight,</L>
<L>Deck join'd to deck, and man engag'd with man,</L>
<L>Sword spoke with sword, and SCOT transfix'd his DANE.</L>
<L>The smoaking oak is cover'd o'er with gore,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If the whole pyrate-crew are now no more.</L>
<L><PB N="81" REF="80"/>
The empty hull from wave to wave is tost,</L>
<L>Nods as it floats, the sport of ev'ry blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The CALEDONIAN chiefs again pursue:</L>
<L>The SCANDINAVIAN fleet o'er ocean flew.</L>
<L>T'elude the foe the DANES fly diff'rent ways;</L>
<L>And cut with sep'rate prows the hoary seas.</L>
<L>Some bear to sea, some rush upon the land,</L>
<L>And fly amain on earth, a trembling band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As, in pursuit of doves, on rapid wings</L>
<L>The darting hawk thro' air his journey sings;</L>
<L>But when the parting flock divides the sky,</L>
<L>Hovers, in doubt this way or that to fly.</L>
<L>So undetermin'd long young DUFFUS stood;</L>
<L>At length he sigh'd, and thus begun aloud:</L>
<L>"While thus, O chiefs, we urge the flying DINE</L>
<L>Unmourn'd, unhonour'd lies the mighty slain;</L>

Forsake with lazy steps the sounding main,</L>
<L>And move a sad and lamentable train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behind the dead the tuneful bards appear,</L>
<L>And mingle with their elegies the tear:</L>
<L>From their sad hearts the mournful numbers flow,</L>
<L>In all the tuneful melody of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In grief's solemnity CULENA leads</L>
<L>A mournful train of tear-distilling maids:</L>
<L>Above the rest, the beauteous queen appears.</L>
<L>And hightens all her beauties with her tears.</L>
