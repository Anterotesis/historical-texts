<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Plot of this Comedy, as far as regards Rivers's visits to Modish and Mrs. Ormond, was taken from the Novel of Sidney Biddulph; Mr. Sheridan had already borrowed the same incident from the same source, and employed it (though in a different manner) in the "School for Scandal."</P>
<P>The "East Indian" was admirably well acted from beginning to end, particularly the part of Rivers by Mr. Kemble: nothing was overchar∣ged, nothing under-acted. Indeed, to call his per∣formance <HI>acting,</HI> is doing it injustice: It was nature throughout.</P>
<P>This Comedy was written before I was sixteen. It was performed last season for the benefits of Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Powell, and, in consequence of the approbation with which it was received, was brought forward again in last December. It was again received with applause, for which I thank the Public: the succeeding representations did not prove attractive, for which I here make my ac∣knowledgments to Mr. Sheridan, who blocked up
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
my road, mounted on his great tragic war-horse Pizarro, and trampled my humble pad-nag of a Comedy under foot without the least compunction. My Readers must decide, whether my Play merit∣ed so transient an existence; it is unnecessary to say, that <HI>I</HI> am quite of the contrary opinion.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Author.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MR. C. KEMBLE.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>IN life's gay spring, while yet the careless hours</L>
<L>Dance light on blooming beds of early flowers,</L>
<L>Ere knowledge of the world has taught the mind</L>
<L>To sorrow for itself and shun mankind,</L>
<L>In sweet vain dreams still Fancy bids the boy</L>
<L>Doat on fair prospects of ideal joy:</L>
<L>Life's choicest fruits then court his eager hand;</L>
<L>Each eye is gentle, and each voice is bland;</L>
<L>False friendship prompts no sigh, and draws no tear,</L>
<L>And love seems scarce more beauteous, than sincere!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ere sixteen years had wing'd their wanton flight,</L>
<L>While yet his head was young, and heart was light,</L>
<L>Our author plann'd these scenes; and while he drew,</L>
<L>How bright each colour seem'd, each line how true.</L>
<L>Gods! with what rapture every speech he spoke!</L>
<L>Gods! how he chuckled as he penn'd each joke!</L>
<L>And when at length his ravish'd eyes survey</L>
<L>That wondrous work complete—a Five Act Play,</L>
<L>His youthful heart how self applauses swell!</L>
<L>—"It isn't perfect, but its vastly well!"—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since then, with many a pang, our Bard has bought</L>
<L>More just decision, and less partial thought:</L>
<L>Kind vanity no longer blinds his sight,</L>
<L>His fillet falls, and lets in odious light.</L>
<L>Time bids the darling work its leaves expand,</L>
<L>Each flower Parnassian withers in his hand;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Stern judgement every latent fault detects,</L>
<L>And all its fancied beauties prove defects.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, for she thinks some scenes possess an art</L>
<L>To please the fancy, and to melt the heart,</L>
<L>Thalia bids his play to-night appear,</L>
<L>Thalia call'd in heaven, but Jordan here<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Comedy was first performed for the Benefit of Mrs. Jordan.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>So frail his hope, so weak he thinks his cause,</L>
<L>Our author says he dares not ask applause;</L>
<L>He only begs, that with indulgence new,</L>
<L>You'll hear him patiently, and hear him through:</L>
<L>Then, if his piece proves worthless, never sham it;</L>
<L>But damn it, gentle friends—Oh! damn it! damn it!</L>

<P>Show him up—
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Robert.]</STAGE>
—I'm glad that he's returned to England; for, though a young man, and a gay man, Beauchamp is among the few whom I esteem.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> BEAUCHAMP.</STAGE>
<P>My dear Ned!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Walsingham!—This pleasure is quite unexpected; but where have you been con∣cealed these hundred years? I was afraid, that Cynthia wearied of her Endymion had pitched upon <HI>you</HI> for his successor, and believed you at this mo∣ment an inhabitant of the moon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my young friend; the goddess has too much taste to select such an old weather-beaten fellow for a Cecisbeo. But if you seriously ask, what I've been doing for these last three years, you must know, I've been fool-hunting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fool-hunting?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Being of an adust cynical consti∣tution, infinite laughter is absolutely necessary for my health: for this purpose my physician pre∣scribed me a course of fools, and truly I've reaped great benefit from his advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then leave Great Britain? Hea∣ven knows, a scarcity of fools is not one of our wants!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but the growth of English ab∣surdity for the year 95 not being to my taste, I de∣termined to change my fools, as other invalids change the air; but after all I must give the pre∣ference to the folly of my own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your own country is very much ob∣liged to you; but since this is your taste, I've a superb feast for you in Lord Listless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, your uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; to my sorrow he sleeps with his fore-fathers, while my noble cousin possesses his title and estate, and, what is worst, has me entirely in his power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a tedious story; but the short of it is, that when I married, my generous uncle dis∣charged my debts to the tune of 3OOOl.: un∣luckily he neglected to destroy my acknowledg∣ment, which falling into his son's hands, the pre∣sent Earl wisely keeps it, and calls himself my sole creditor. Discharge it for some time I can∣not;
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
but, however, unless we disagree, he will not press me for immediate payment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, and even if he should, we'll find means to satisfy him; and so away with that gloomy face, dear Ned! As soon as I saw you, I guessed that something was wrong; but I'm glad, 'twas nothing more than a pecuniary difficulty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would to heaven, it were!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey? Why what other cause—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Mr. Walsingham, how shall I tell you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out with it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I have been—That I still am—a villain!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe one word of it: he, who dares own that he has been a villain, must needs already have ceased to be one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me then, and judge for yourself—You knew well the character of the woman, to whose fate, while I was still a stripling, accident not affection united mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and a miserable life she led you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous without love, profuse without generosity, negligent in her dress, violent in her temper, coarse in her manners, with no virtue but that one which she owed to constitution, not to principle, during three years she rendered my home an hell. My patience was at length ex∣hausted; I made over to her the remnants of an estate which her extravagance had ruined, bade this domestic fiend an eternal farewell, and sailed, under the assumed name of Dorimant, to India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see no harm as yet. Lived with her three years? I wouldn't have lived with her three days—No! not to have buried her on the fourth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soon after my arrival, it was my chance to save the life of the famous Mortimer, who—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Nabob, whose immense wealth—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. This procured me admis∣sion to his house, where I saw his daughter: She was lovely, and grateful to me for the preservation of her father's life; opportunities of seeing each other were frequent, and in an unguarded moment—yet heaven can witness to my intentions!—in an unguarded moment I—I was a villain!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>[shaking his head]</STAGE>—Little better, I must say!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Her</HI> weakness and <HI>my</HI> per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dy were soon discovered. Marry her, I could not; her father's wrath was dreadful; she sought a refuge from it in <HI>my</HI> arms, and fled with me from India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>From India, and from her father? Young man! Young man! And what says your wife to all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Soon after our separation, I find that she went abroad, nor has she been heard of for near two years either by her banker, or her friends. Report says, that she is dead: If so, my hand is Zorayda's; and in the mean while she resides with my cousin, Lady Clara Modish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lady Clara? And how the devil came <HI>she</HI> to receive her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil made her, the great Devil of all! Money, man, darling money! Her Lady∣ship had been extravagant, and so I paid a gaming debt or two for her: besides this, the appearance of protecting a friendless orphan flatters that often∣tatious sensibility, which it is her passion to display on every occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does she know the history of her protegée?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was compelled to trust her with it un∣der a promise of profound secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how has she kept her promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really extremely well, considering she's a woman of fashion. She only confided it to her most intimate friends, who told it again to all their particular acquaintance, who repeated it to every creature they knew; and now the whole Town is informed of the whole transaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you really have the heart to present this poor young creature to the world in a light so despicable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare your reproaches, my dear sir; they have already been made by a very able advo∣cate. You remember Modish's sister, Emily?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Young Ormond's widow?—A charm∣ing creature!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is interested about Zorayda, and has frequently written to me on this subject. Her remonstrances have carried with them conviction, and I am resolved to wait on her this morning to entreat her protection for Zorayda; and, should she grant it, to engage, cruel as it will be to the feelings of us both, no more to visit my love, till I can offer her my hand and fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very good resolution too: I long to see your goddess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then to Lady Clara's, and behold the fictitious charms of modish beauty effaced by the native graces, the enchanting simplicity of my artless, my bewitching Zorayda! But as this is but weak attraction for a satirist, if you still exclaim, "Thou, Folly, art my goddess!" I can promise
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
you some diversion in your own way; for Lady Clara's table is seldom unsupplied with a plentiful banquet of fools.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WAL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every table in town may be supplied with that article at a very small expence, I doubt not; for, after all my peregrinations in quest of folly, I am decided, that no country abounds more with that luxury than little, England; where ab∣surdities spring as kindly as mushrooms upon dunghills, and you can't turn a corner without starting a fool!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this shall be done, though not exactly by me; situated as I am with Lady Clara, I cannot go myself to her house uninvited; but I think Mr. Rivers may without impropriety, under the pretext of returning to her this now unneces∣sary present.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>BEAU.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unnecessary! Have his wants then been already relieved?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>They needed no relief; Rivers is wealthy, and the object of his visit to Lady Clara's this morning was to make an experiment on her heart, not her purse. Zorayda's gift, therefore, being now superfluous, I will persuade Rivers to return it to her himself; and while expressing his gratitude for her well-intended benevolence, he may take an opportunity of convincing her that your absence is necessary, that Lady Clara's is by no means a proper abode for her, and he shall press her, 'till the result of your inquiries shall have de∣termined her future conduct, to accept an asylum in my house.</P>

<P>Emily, it was my misfortune to have a daughter on whom my soul doated. Her mother died while my child was yet an infant, and my child was the image of that mother, was the de∣light of my eye, was the comfort of my heart, was the solitary blessing of my existence; and while that one blessing was mine, I thought I possessed every other! This daughter, this very idolized daughter, sacrificed to passion <HI>her</HI> honour and <HI>my</HI> love, abandoned me for a villain, and her father became childless!</P>

Fudge!—And now Emily, what dismal tale have you to relate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. ORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>One, my dear sir, which interests me nearly. Soon after your leaving me this morn∣ing, I owed my rescue from the grossest imperti∣nence to an officer, who unluckily was indebted for a large sum to the coxcomb by whom I was insulted. This note informs me, that, in conse∣quence of having afforded me his protection, he has been arrested, and is now confined at the suit of Lord Listless.</P>

<P>Confined? He shall not be so long. Eng∣land needs such men, nor shall she be deprived of them, while <HI>I</HI> can help it.—What does your friend owe?—</P>

<P>Not less than 3000l.</P>

Beauchamp!—</P>

<SP>

<P>Even he; and his conduct to me this morning must convince you, that, if he has faults, he is not without virtues—but I hasten with these good tidings to Miss Mandeville.—Oh Mr. Rivers! believe me I feel well, how trifling a gift is the wealth which you heap upon me, com∣pared

My embarrassments increase every hour—Why, why must Beauchamp have faults to none but me?—What course shall I pur∣sue?—Suppose—Yes!

<L>"Is play'd a <HI>Comédie</HI> that's <HI>toute nouvelle</HI>"—</L>
<STAGE>[His majesty speaks French extremely well]</STAGE>
<L>"I to this piece your new existence tie,</L>
<L>"And, as it lives or dies, you live or die.</L>
<L>"Should the dread ordeal with success be pass'd,</L>
<L>"Your second life shall for the season last;</L>
<L>"But, should it fail, instant (I'd have you know it)</L>
<L>"Here you return, and with you....bring the poet."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I took his offer, pack'd up hoods and ruffs,</L>
<L>Strait bodice, farthingales, and little muffs;</L>
<L>And least old Dis should take his promise back,</L>
<L>Through yon trap-door reach'd Drury in a crack.</L>
<L>Now then I come before the Public's throne,</L>
<L>To plead the author's cause, and eke my own.</L>
<L>Think with what terrors must my bosom tremble,</L>
<L>Since that the piece is bad I can't dissemble:</L>
<L>Yet, weary with my journey, faint with fright;</L>
<L>Pray don't oblige me to set out to-night;</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="93"/>Rather with kind applause prolong my stay,</L>
<L>And for a few short nights support the play.</L>
<L>But, should my prayers prove vain, should the piece fail,</L>
<L>The plot thought dull,—the humour coarse and stale,</L>
<L>Bess out of sorts, and Poet out of feather,</L>
<L>Are damn'd alike, and jog down stairs together.</L>
