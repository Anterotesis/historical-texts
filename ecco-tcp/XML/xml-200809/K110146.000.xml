<L>Had triumph'd long o'er many a Swain,</L>
<L>And oft' been woo'd, but woo'd in vain;</L>
<L>Not so <HI>Amanda,</HI> blooming Youth,</L>
<L>Soft Innocence, and artless Truth,</L>
<L>Were all the Beauties she cou'd boast,</L>
<L>Not form'd by Nature for a Toast;</L>
<L>Yet some there were, who in her Mind</L>
<L>A thousand nameless Charms cou'd find:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="13"/>She lov'd not Visits, Park, or Play,</L>
<L>But mop'd, and read her Time away;</L>
<L>Insensible to a Degree,</L>
<L>Her Heart was all her own, and free;</L>
<L>Yet oft of Love's soft pleasing Pains,</L>
<L>The Nymph wou'd write in melting Strains.</L>
<L>The lambent Flame that warm'd her Breast,</L>
<L>Each tender flowing Line confess'd;</L>
<L><HI>Moneses,</HI> whose enchanting Form</L>
<L>Was one continu'd endless Charm:</L>
<L>To whom indulgent Heav'n had join'd,</L>
<L>All that cou'd beautify a Mind;</L>
<L>Had often own'd bright Beauty's Power,</L>
<L>Had sigh'd and lov'd — for half an Hour.</L>
<L>But yet the lovely Youth confess'd,</L>
<L>Whoe'er could wound his destin'd Breast,</L>
<L>Her Charms must over Time prevail,</L>
<L>Her Wit must please when Beauty fail'd;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="14"/>Yet since he cou'd not hope to find,</L>
<L>One blest with all those Charms of Mind;</L>
<L>He thought <HI>Clarissa</HI> worth his Care,</L>

<L>Soft Vows, and tender speaking Eyes,</L>
<L>Pleading Looks, and melting Sighs;</L>
<L>Make the believing Maid approve</L>
<L>His false, but well dissembled Love.</L>
<L>But while <HI>Clarissa</HI>'s Charms he own'd,</L>

<L><HI>Amanda</HI> found the Way to win</L>
<L>His Heart, and let her Image in;</L>
<L>His Pain the lovely Youth conceals,</L>
<L>All but what his Eyes reveals:</L>
<L>His Eyes, that all his Passion tell,</L>
<L>And speak the Love he felt so well.</L>

<L><HI>Clarissa</HI> still exults, and cries,</L>
<L>He's yet a Victim to my Eyes;</L>

<L>Ah! cease to claim my charming Prize;</L>
<L><HI>Amanda,</HI> to the Fair replies,</L>
<L>Cou'd I, <HI>Clarissa,</HI> cou'd I boast,</L>
<L>The Hearts that to thy Charms are lost,</L>
<L>With Joy I wou'd them all resign,</L>
<L>To keep my lov'd <HI>Moneses</HI> mine.</L>

<L>In vain the Nymph declares her Flame,</L>

<L>Fit Scenes of hopeless Love, and black Despair.</L>
<L>But now, oh—<HI>Hilpah</HI> Paradise appears,</L>
<L>And a new <HI>Eden</HI> rises 'midst my Tears.</L>
<L>Here opening Flowers the ravish'd Sense invade,</L>
<L>There spreading Cedars form a grateful Shade.</L>
<L>Soft gliding Streams, which murmur as they flow,</L>
<L>And Gales that all <HI>Arabia</HI>'s Odours blow.</L>
<L>Come up then, my Belov'd! Oh come and grace</L>
<L>This Spot of Earth, with a young lovely Race.</L>
<L>Let a fair num'rous Offspring fill each Shade,</L>
<L>And a-new-peopled World by thee be made.</L>
<L>Remember, fair One, that the Age of Man</L>
<L>Is but a thousand Years, and quickly gone:</L>
<L>Beauty, tho' much admir'd, yet soon is past,</L>
<L>Its transient Glories but some Centuries last:</L>
<L><PB N="88" REF="93"/>Like a tall Oak, which long on <HI>Tirzah</HI>'s Height</L>
<L>Display'd its growing Branches to the Sight;</L>
<L>Now worn with Age it falls, nor thought of more,</L>
<L>Unless some Root its Memory restore:</L>
<L>Which with increasing Verdure still may rise,</L>
<L>And like its Parent-Tree invade the Skies,</L>
<L>Think well on this, then haste to make me blest;</L>
<L>Be happy now, and leave to Fate the rest.</L>
