<LG>
<L>PROLOGUES, with caustic touch, have often tried</L>
<L>To probe your spleen, prove knaves and fools allied;</L>
<L>Have twisted words and wit ten thousand ways,</L>
<L>To shew that these are most degenerate days!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A different task be ours.—We'll prove that you</L>
<L>Are wise and happy. Nay! tho' strange, 'tis true!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First on your <HI>safety</HI> think! now belles appear</L>
<L>By ample bulwarks guarded, front and rear!</L>
<L>Now male and female amble, side by side,</L>
<L>Exempt from harm, by breast-works fortify'd!</L>
<L>Here polygons defend Miss Molly's breast!</L>
<L>There horn-works hush the husband's fears to rest!</L>
<L>By ramparts, daily rais'd, he's freed from cares;</L>
<L>If he'll but grant sufficient for repairs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our strength thus prov'd, proceed we to disclose</L>
<L>How new-made wealth thro' new-made channels flows!</L>
<L>How rich we are, in medal-rust and rare things!</L>
<L>In copper coins, gilt pence and—Queen-Anne-farthings!</L>
<L>How shells, stuff'd monkies, and Cremonas old,</L>
<L>In hand of Auctioneer, are current gold!</L>
<L>He "Going! going!" cries. "The hammer's up!</L>
<L>"This fine antique! this Roman—<HI>caudle-cup!"</HI></L>
<L>A gem so rare makes connoisseurs turn pale,</L>
<L>Fearful, alike, to purchase or to fail!</L>
<L>Hope trembles, starts, from lip to lip rebounds,</L>
<L>Till down she's knock'd by—Ah!—one thousand pounds!</L>
<L>The envied purchaser, with joy e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate,</L>
<L>Pays for his prize by—felling his estate!</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes! sure you're happy! and should rest content,</L>
<L>Now landscapes are reduced fifteen per cent:</L>
<L>And Claude's and Titian's new-found wonders may</L>
<L>By new-made Peers be bought—if new-made Peers to pay.</L>

</LG>
<STAGE>Returning to his former chearful tone.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>All things considered, now, while safety smiles,</L>
<L>And wealth inundates thus our Queen of isles;</L>
<L>While Vickery head defects so soon repairs,</L>
<L>And half unpeoples Greenland of her bears;</L>
<L>While exhibitions, galas and reviews,</L>
<L>Lisle-street, Vauxhall, the Abbey, Handel, Hughes,</L>
<L>Flutes, fiddles, trombos, double-drums, bassoons,</L>
<L>Mara, the speaking-figure, fish-balloons,</L>
<L>Earth-baths, live-eagles, such as never flew,</L>
<L><HI>L' Hercule du Roy!</HI> and General Jackoo!</L>
<L>While these create a round of such delight,</L>
<L>Sure, we may hope, you will not frown to-night!</L>
<L>While farces numerous as these go down,</L>
<L>Our farce may in its turn amuse the town;</L>
<L>And, smiling thus on Folly's vast career,</L>
<L>Sure not on us, alone, you'll be severe!</L>
