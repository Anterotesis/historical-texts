<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you have done me the honour to make me the subject of your dramatic satire; in doing which, you have flown off in a direct tangent from the circle of science; you will excuse me, if, in returning the compliment, I have at any time, ap∣parently deviated from the line of mathematical truth, in modelling the figures of poetical fiction. The force of me∣taphorical expressions is not to be estimated so precisely as the momentum of mechanic powers; and yet there may be as much veracity couched under the moral of an allegory as in the most demonstrable proposition of Euclid. Of this, at least, I am certain that my characters are as justly drawn and my allusions as apt and applicable as yours: Save and except,
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
indeed, your incomparable parallels, which, at the same time as they preserve their parallelism, diverge, with a true poetical licence, like rays from a common centre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Spleen, or Islington Spa.

We, who know theatrical managers much better, know their manoeuvres are not always di∣rected by such motives of duty and loyalty. We ourselves have attended both Mr. G. and Mr. C. behind the scenes, for popular paragraphs, in ridicule of their royal master; written immediately after their having obsequiously lighted him out of the theatre.<BIBL>THE DOERS OF THE NEWS-PAPERS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></L>
