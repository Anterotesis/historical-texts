<HEAD>AN EPISTLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH Falsehood lurking in thy sordid Breast,</L>
<L>And Perj'ry's Seal upon thy Heart imprest,</L>
<L>Dar'st Thou, Oh Christian, brave the sounding Waves,</L>
<L>The treach'rous Whirlwinds, and wide-yawning Graves?</L>
<L>Regardless of my Woes securely go,</L>
<L>No curse-fraught Accents from these Lips shall flow;</L>
<L>My fondest Wish shall catch thy flying Sail,</L>
<L>Attend thy Course, and urge the fav'ring Gale:</L>
<L>May ev'ry Bliss thy God confers be thine,</L>
<L>And all thy Share of Woe compris'd in mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<L>One humble Boon is all I now implore,</L>
<L>Allow these Feet to print their kindred Shore:</L>
<L>Give me, Oh Albion's Son, again to roam</L>
<L>For Thee deserted my delightful Home:</L>
<L>To view the Groves that deck my native Scene,</L>
<L>The limpid Stream, that graceful glides between:</L>
<L>Retrieve the Fame I spurn'd at Love's Decree,</L>
<L>Ascend the Throne which I forsook for Thee:</L>
<L>Approach the Bow'r—(why starts th' unbidden Tear?)</L>
<L>Where once thy YARICO to Thee was dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Scenes the Hand of Time has thrown behind</L>
<L>Return impetuous to my busy Mind:</L>
<L>'What hostile Vessel quits the roaring Tide</L>
<L>'To harbour here its tempest-beaten Side?</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>'Behold the Beach receives the ship-wreck'd Crew:</L>
<L>'Oh mark their strange Attire and pallid Hue!</L>
<L>'Are these the Christians, restless Sons of Pride,</L>
<L>'By Av'rice nurtur'd, to Deceit allied?</L>
<L>'Who tread with cunning Step the Maze of Art,</L>
<L>'And mask with placid Looks a canker'd Heart?</L>
<L>'Yet note, superior to the num'rous Throng,</L>
<L>'(Ev'n as the Citron humbler Plants among)</L>
<L>'That Youth!—Lo! Beauty on his graceful Brow</L>
<L>'With nameless Charms bids ev'ry Feature glow.</L>
<L>'Ah! leave, fair Stranger, this unsocial Ground,</L>
<L>'Where Danger broods, and Fury stalks around:</L>
<L>'Behold thy Foes advance—my Steps pursue</L>
<L>'To where I'll screen Thee from their fatal View:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>'He comes, he comes! th' ambrosial Feast prepare,</L>
<L>'The Fig, the Palm-juice, nor th' Anâna spare:</L>
<L>'In spacious Canisters nor fail to bring</L>
<L>'The scented Foliage of the blushing Spring:</L>
<L>'Ye graceful Handmaids, dress the roseate Bow'r,</L>
<L>'And hail with Music this auspicious Hour;</L>
<L>'Ah no! forbear—be ev'ry Lyre unstrung,</L>
<L>'More pleasing Music warbles from his Tongue;</L>
<L>'Yet, utter not to me the Lover's Vow,</L>
<L>'All, all is thine that Friendship can bestow:</L>
<L>'Our Laws, my Station, check the guilty Flame,</L>
<L>'Why was I born, ye Powers, a Nubian Dame?</L>
<L>'Yet see around at Love's enchanting Call,</L>
<L>'Stern Laws submit, and vain Distinctions fall:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>'And Mortals then enjoy Life's transient Day,</L>
<L>'When smit with Passion they indulge the Sway:</L>
<L>'Yes! crown'd with Bliss we'll roam the conscious Grove,</L>
<L>'And drink long Draughts of unexhausted Love:</L>
<L>'Nor Joys alone, thy Dangers too I'll share,</L>
<L>'With Thee the Menace of the Waves I'll dare:</L>
<L>'In vain—for smiles his Brow deep Frowns involve,</L>
<L>'The sacred Ties of Gratitude dissolve,</L>
<L>'See Faith distracted rends her comely Hair,</L>
<L>'His fading Vows while tainted Zephyrs bear!'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh Thou, before whose seraph-guarded Throne</L>
<L>The Christians bow and other Gods disown,</L>
<L>If wrapt in Darkness thou deny'st thy Ray,</L>
<L>And shroud'st from Nubia thy celestial Day!</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>Indulge this fervent Pray'r to Thee address'd,</L>
<L>Indulge, tho' utter'd from a sable Breast:</L>
<L>May gath'ring Storms eclipse the chearful Skies,</L>
<L>And mad'ning Furies from thy Hell arise:</L>
<L>With glaring Torches meet his impious Brow,</L>
<L>And drag him howling to the Gulf below!</L>
<L>Ah no!—May Heav'n's bright Messengers descend,</L>
<L>Obey his Call, his every Wish attend!</L>
<L>Still o'er his Form their hov'ring Wings display!</L>
<L>If he be blest, these Pangs admit Allay:</L>
<L>Me still her Mark let angry Fortune deem,</L>
<L>So thou may'st walk beneath her cloudless Beam.</L>
<L>Yet oft to my wrapt Ear didst Thou repeat,</L>
<L>That I suffic'd to frame thy Bliss compleat:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>For Love's pure Flame I took thy transient Fires:</L>
<L>We fondly credit what the Heart desires.</L>
<L>I hop'd, alas! to breathe thy native Air,</L>
<L>And vie in Splendor with the British Fair:</L>
<L>Ascend the speedy Car enchas'd with Gold,</L>
<L>With Robes of Silk this pearl-deck'd Form infold:</L>
<L>Bid on this jetty Hand the Diamond glow,</L>
<L>And chosen Rubies sparkle from my Brow.</L>
<L>Deluded Sex! the Dupes of Man decreed,</L>
<L>We, splendid Victims, at his Altar bleed.</L>
<L>The grateful Accents of thy candy'd Tongue,</L>
<L>Where artful Flatt'ry too persuasive hung,</L>
<L>Like Flow'rs adorn'd the Path to my Disgrace,</L>
<L>And bade Destruction wear a smiling Face.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>Yet form'd by Nature in her choicest Mould,</L>
<L>While on thy Cheek her blushing Charms unfold,</L>
<L>Who could oppose to Thee stern Virtue's Shield?</L>
<L>What tender Virgin would not wish to yield?</L>
<L>But Pleasure on the Wings of Time was born,</L>
<L>And I expos'd a Prey to grinning Scorn.</L>
<L>Of low-born Traders—mark the Hand of Fate!</L>
<L>Is YARICO reduc'd to grace the State,</L>
<L>Whose impious Parents, an advent'rous Band,</L>
<L>Imbrued with guiltless Blood my native Land:</L>
<L>Ev'n snatch'd my Father from his regal Seat,</L>
<L>And stretch'd him breathless at their hostile Feet?</L>
<L>Ill-fated Prince! The Christians sought thy Shore,</L>
<L>Unsheath'd the Sword, and Mercy was no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<L>But Thou, fair Stranger, cam'st with gentler Mind</L>
<L>To shun the Perils of the wrecking Wind.</L>
<L>Amidst thy Foes thy Safety still I plan'd,</L>
<L>And reach'd for galling Chains the Myrtle Band:</L>
<L>Nor then unconscious of the secret Fire</L>
<L>Each Heart voluptuous throb'd with soft Desire:</L>
<L>Ah pleasing Youth, kind Object of my Care,</L>
<L>Companion, Friend, and ev'ry Name that's dear!</L>
<L>Say, from thy Mind canst thou so soon remove</L>
<L>The Records pencil'd by the Hand of Love?</L>
<L>How as we wanton'd on the flow'ry Ground</L>
<L>The loose-rob'd Pleasures danc'd unblam'd around:</L>
<L>Till to the Sight the growing Burden proy'd,</L>
<L>How Thou o'ercam'st—and how, alas! I lov'd!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
Too fatal Proof! since Thou, with Av'rice fraught,</L>
<L>Didst basely urge (ah, shun the wounding Thought!)</L>
<L>That tender Circumstance—reveal it not,</L>
<L>Lest torn with Rage I curse my fated Lot:</L>
<L>Lest startled Reason abdicate her Reign,</L>
<L>And Madness revel in this heated Brain:</L>
<L>That tender Circumstance—inhuman Part—</L>
<L>I will not weep, tho' Serpents gnaw this Heart:</L>
<L>Frail, frail Resolve! while gushing from mine Eye</L>
<L>The pearly Drops these boastful Words belie.</L>
<L>Alas! can Sorrow in this Bosom sleep,</L>
<L>Where strikes Ingratitude her Talons deep?</L>
<L>When he I still adore, to Nature dead,</L>
<L>For Roses plants with Thorns the nuptial Bed?</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>Bids from the widow'd Couch kind Peace remove,</L>
<L>And cold Indiff'rence blast the Bow'r of Love?</L>
<L>What Time his Guardian Pow'r I most requir'd,</L>
<L>Against my Fame and Happiness conspir'd!</L>
<L>And (do I live to breathe the barb'rous Tale?)</L>
<L>His faithful YARICO expos'd to Sale!</L>
<L>Yes, basely urg'd (regardless of my Pray'rs,</L>
<L>Ev'n while I bath'd his venal Hand with Tears)</L>
<L>What most for Pity call'd—I can no more—</L>
<L>My future Child—to swell his impious Store:</L>
<L>All, all Mankind for this will rise thy Foe,</L>
<L>But I, alas! alone endure the Woe:</L>
<L>Alone endure the fest'ring Hand of Care,</L>
<L>The bleeding Soul, and Swoonings of Despair.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>Was it for this I left my native Plain,</L>
<L>And dar'd the Tempest brooding on the Main?</L>
<L>For this unlock'd (seduc'd by Christian Art)</L>
<L>The chaste Affections of my Virgin Heart?</L>
<L>Within this Bosom fan'd the, constant Flame,</L>
<L>And fondly languish'd for a Mother's Name?</L>
<L>Lo! every Hope is poison'd in its Bloom,</L>
<L>And Horrors watch around this guilty Womb.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Blood illustrious circling thro' these Veins,</L>
<L>Which ne'er was chequer'd with Plebeian Stains,</L>
<L>Thro' Ancestry's long Line ennobled Springs,</L>
<L>From fame-crown'd Warriors and exalted Kings:</L>
<L>Must I the Shafts of Infamy sustain?</L>
<L>To Slav'ry's purposes my Infant Train?</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>To catch the Glances of his haughty Lord?</L>
<L>Attend obedient at the festive Board?</L>
<L>From Hands unscepter'd take the scornful Blow?</L>
<L>Uproot the Thoughts of Glory as they grow?</L>
<L>Let this pervade at length thy Heart of Steel;</L>
<L>Yet, yet return, nor blush, Oh Man, to feel:</L>
<L>Ah! guide thy Steps from yon expecting Fleet,</L>
<L>Thine injur'd YARICO relenting meet:</L>
<L>Bid her recline woe-stricken on thy Breast,</L>
<L>And hush her raging Sorrows into Rest:</L>
<L>Ah! let the Youth that sent the cruel Dart,</L>
<L>Extract the Point invenom'd from her Heart:</L>
<L>The Peace he banish'd from this Mind recall,</L>
<L>And bid the Tears he prompted cease to fall.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>Then while the Stream of Life is giv'n to flow,</L>
<L>And sable Hue o'erspread this youthful Brow;</L>
<L>Or curl untaught by Art this woolly Hair,</L>
<L>So long, so long to me shalt Thou be dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, lovely Youth, flow all my Words in vain,</L>
<L>Like Seeds that strew the rude ungrateful Plain?</L>
<L>Say, shall I ne'er regain thy wonted Grace?</L>
<L>Ne'er stretch these Arms to catch the wish'd Embrace?</L>
<L>Enough—with new-awak'd Resentment fraught</L>
<L>Assist me, Heav'n! to tear him from my Thought;</L>
<L>No longer vainly suppliant will I bow,</L>
<L>And give to Love what I to Hatred owe;</L>
<L>Forgetful of the Race from whence I came,</L>
<L>With Woe acquainted, but unknown to Shame.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>Hence, vile Dejection, with thy plaintive Pray'r,</L>
<L>Thy bended Knee, and still descending Tear:</L>
<L>Rejoin, rejoin the pale-complexion'd Train—</L>
<L>The Conflict's past—and I'm myself again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou Parent Sun! if e'er with pious Lay</L>
<L>I usher'd in thy world-reviving Ray!</L>
<L>Or as thy fainter Beams illum'd the West,</L>
<L>With grateful Voice I hymn'd Thee to thy Rest</L>
<L>Beheld with wond'ring Eye thy radiant Seat,</L>
<L>Or sought thy sacred Dome with unclad Feet!</L>
<L>If near to thy bright Altars as I drew,</L>
<L>My votive Lamb, thy holy Flamen, slew!</L>
<L>Forgive! That I, irrev'rent of thy Name,</L>
<L>Dar'd for thy Foe indulge th' unhallow'd Flame:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>Ev'n on a Christian lavish'd my Esteem,</L>
<L>And scorn'd the sable Children of thy Beam.</L>
<L>This Poniard by my daring Hand imprest</L>
<L>Shall drin? the ruddy Drops that warm my Breast:</L>
<L>Nor I alone, by this immortal Deed</L>
<L>From Slav'ry's Laws my Infant shall be freed.</L>
<L>And Thou, whose Ear is deaf to Pity's Call,</L>
<L>Behold at length thy destin'd Victim' fall;</L>
<L>Behold thy once-lov'd Nubian stain'd with Gore,</L>
<L>Unwept, extended on the crimson Floor:</L>
<L>These Temples clouded with the Shades of Death,</L>
<L>These Lips unconscious of the ling'ring Breath:</L>
<L>These Eyes uprais'd (ere clos'd by Fate's Decree)</L>
<L>To catch expiring one faint Glimpse of Thee.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18"/>Ah! then thy YARICO forbear to dread,</L>
<L>My fault'ring Voice no longer will upbraid,</L>
<L>Demand due Vengeance of the Pow'rs above,</L>
<L>Or, more offensive still, implore thy Love.</L>
