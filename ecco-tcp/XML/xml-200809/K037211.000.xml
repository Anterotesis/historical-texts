<P>THE success, which a juvenile sketch of this Play hath met with in publication, having induced the Author to bring it on the stage; he flatters himself the alterations, which were thought necessary to accommodate it to a theatrical audience, will not give less satisfaction to the reader than such scenes as he was obliged on that account to reject.</P>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. DODD, in the Character of MERCURY.</BYLINE>

<L>A LA MERCURE, <HI>equipp'd from top to toe,</HI></L>
<L>My godship's name and quality you know.</L>
<L>Commission'd from Apollo, I come down</L>
<L>T'attend this bench of justices, the town.</L>
<L>Assembled here; all members of the quorum:</L>
<L>To lay a matter of complaint before 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The errand's not in character, 'tis true;</L>
<L>But what our betters bid us, we must do.</L>
<L>Therefore, t'appear with decency at session,</L>
<L>I've stole, you see, the garb of the profession.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This gown and band belong to serjeant Prig—</L>
<L>And this—our brother Puzzle's learned wig.—</L>
<STAGE>[Putting on the gown, &amp;c.</STAGE>

<L>So—now to business—Hem!—<HI>si vestris placet</HI>—</L>
<L>May't please your worships—Forgery, which is grown</L>
<L>To such a height as ne'er before was known—</L>
<L>I say, a forgery hath been committed,</L>
<L>By which king Pluto's mirmidons, outwitted,</L>
<L>Certain choice spirits, in theatric shape,</L>
<L>Have suffer'd from Elisium to escape;</L>
<L>Of Shakespeare's offspring and ideal train,</L>
<L>Sprung, Pallas like, from an immortal brain!</L>
<L>Their names—I have 'em down—but, to be brief,</L>
<L>Shall only just enumerate the chief.</L>
<L>Imprimis, with Madeira swell'd, and sack,</L>
<L>There's Sir John Falstaff, alias call'd Plump Jack;</L>
<L>Next, captain Pistol, a notorious bully;</L>
<L>And Miss Dol Tearsheet, fam'd for jilting cully;</L>
<L>The widow Quickly, vintner, bawd and whore.</L>
<L>With Bardolph, Peto, Nym and—several more;</L>
<L>Link'd in a gang, each cut-purse with his crony,</L>
<L>All arrant thieves and <HI>Dramatis Personae</HI>;</L>
<L>Bent, as suppos'd, to prostitute to shame</L>
<L>Th' aforesaid Shakespeare's honour, name and fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I shall not trespass on your worship's time,</L>
<L>T' explain at full the nature of this crime:</L>
<L>But, Poets having an exclusive right</L>
<L>To bring their mental progeny to light,</L>
<L>This right's invaded by the party 'peach'd;</L>
<L>Who, <HI>vi et armis,</HI> hath th' old bard o'er-reach'd.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>By counterfeiting of his hand, do ye see,</L>
<L>Feloniously to set these vagrants free;</L>
<L>With base design t'adopt them for his own,</L>
<L>Tho' Shakespeare's property, and his alone.</L>
<L>Such is the fact.—A critic were an ass,</L>
<L>No doubt, to let such imposition pass;</L>
<L>Nor could a cheat so palpable succeed,</L>
<L>But that the captain of the guard cou'dn't read—</L>
<L>No, not for laughing, tho' to've sav'd his soul;</L>
<L>The scene and circumstances were so d roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pistol, with yellow night-cap patch'd with red,</L>
<L>With Mother Quickly was retir'd to bed;</L>
<L>And, waking, swore, by Styx, he would not come,</L>
<L>Sans preparation, pike and beat of drum.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of <HI>aqua-vitae</HI> having stole a flaggon,</L>
<L>Bardolph and Nym were playing at snap-dragon;</L>
<L>Sometimes proceeding from hard words to blows,</L>
<L>As by mistake Nym seiz'd on Bardolph's nose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With Falstaff sat Dol Tearsheet, cheek by joll,</L>
<L>And while she buss'd his chin and scratch'd his poll,</L>
<L>Slipp'd from his thumb his grandfire's copper ring,</L>
<L>For love, not for the value, of the thing:</L>
<L>Then stole his empty purse; but no abuse;</L>
<L>'T was only done to keep her hand in use:</L>
<L>He swearing, he'd be damn'd as soon as trust his</L>
<L>Round belly more with Hall, or his chief-justice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But this is wandering from the point.—They're here,</L>
<L>And on your summons ready to appear:</L>
<L>Please to proceed then to examination;</L>
<L>And be attentive to their information.</L>
<L>If, as your judgment cannot be erroneous,</L>
<L>You take this forgery to be felonious,</L>
<L>The author meaning fraud, I need not mention</L>
<L>Your issuing warrants for his apprehension;</L>
<L>And when you've caught and into pieces tore him,</L>
<L>Hang up his mangled carcase <HI>in terrorem</HI>;</L>
<L>In flagrant crimes the process should be short;</L>
<L>The law is clear—I leave it with the court.</L>

<P>O, Sir John, I'm glad I have found ye. I was in the fearfullest quandary for you in the world. I hope your honour has got no hurt.</P>

<P>Not its death's wound, I hope; though Hal, in∣deed, look'd somewhat cold upon me.</P>

<P>Hold thy ill-omen'd croaking. If faithful ser∣vices are thus requited, I will turn cordwainer; yea, cob∣ler, and heel piece old shoes, ere I have to do with blood-royal again. Ingratitude! I hate it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, Sir John, what you say is right; for, as the song says, ingratitude is worse than the sin of witch∣craft. But I hop'd your honour got no personable harm in the mob: you was carried off the terras, for all the world, like a danghil from Mill-bank by a spring-tide.</P>

<SP>
<P>I would I were in East-cheap. Mine hostess hath a most excellent cordial; and I never stood in more need of it than now. The gross indignity Hal hath put on me, sticks in my throat; and, in the end, may go near to choak me. I shall never gulp it down: that's flat: unless, indeed, a full cup of sherris help to clear the way. And then, how I shall stomach it; how I shall digest it, heaven knows! At present, both my person and knighthood are in jeopardy; my Lord-chief-justice, to whose care I am commended, holding me not altogether in good liking. But no matter—if I am to be provided for, what avails it who is my caterer? I could wish, nevertheless, old white wine stood higher in his Lordship's favour; that I may not be stinted at table, or in my by-drinkings. I like notsuch splenetic temperaments; such phlegmatic con∣stitutions; grey-beards, that never make allowances for the continual waste of radical moisture.—'Sblood,

I am as foundered and as sore as a blind horse in a mill.—Bardolph! where a plague art thou gotten to, caterwauling?</P>

<P>O, sweet Sir John!</P>

<P>How! mine hostess, and my good vestal Mrs. Tearsheet! save ye gentlewomen both, good-morrow.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Host.</SPEAKER>
<P>Godild ye, Sir John—well I vow and protest an I didn't say he would take as civil notice of his old acquaintance: nay, tho'f he was created by my lord-mayor of London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doll.</SPEAKER>
<P>What talk ye of lord-mayors and fusty citizens, gossip Quickly? Sir John is a courtier, and to be sure we must gratulate him now as one of the greatest knights in the nation.—O sweet Sir John!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truce with your formalities, Mrs. Dorothy. Pray, have you seen none of our followers by the way? Pistol, nor Peto!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>No verily, Sir John, not one.—We have seen nothing of any of them to day. They are all gone to the coronation, I warrant; and indeed we should have been there too, hadn't it been for that wicked villain, con∣stable Fang, that, by a mistake of the beadle of our ward, would have carried us to Bridewel this morning.</P>

<P>That thou hast, hostess; of the male half, I'll be sworn for thee.</P>
</SP>

<P>Besides, says I, do you know Sir John Falstaff! says I.—Touch a hair of Mrs. Dorothy's head, says I, and Sir John will make you smart for it, says I, ev'ry bone in your skin, says I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what said the rascal to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Said, Sir John! he stood mumchance, and spoke never a living syllable, but set his vinegar-visag'd catch∣poles upon us; who fastened their claws into Mrs. Tear∣sheet's best kirtle, and tore it into as many rents and tat∣ters, as there were in the old tapestry hangings I pawn'd to fit your honour out for the last expedition.</P>

<P>Pshaw!</P>

<P>Yes indeed, Sir John, made a mere tatterdemal∣lion of me. But we did so tongue the leather-ear'd vul∣tures—</P>

<P>That they were glad to loose their gripe to get rid of you, I suppose.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir John, I was obliged to perduce an angel to convince them we were not the parties indicted.</P>

<P>Infidel rogues! would nothing less than the testi∣mony of an angel convince them?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, sirrah! what call'st thou a bawdy-house
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
I sent thee to look out for a house of civil entertainment, where I might repose myself after my fatigue? Why, what, you rogue, would you make of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry come up indeed! a bawdy-house tru∣ly! but as to a house of civil entertainment, Sir John; here is one hard by, where the knights and lords, and all the great gentlemen of the court, are entertained, both by night and by day, as civilly as at their own homes; and by gentlewomen as kind to them, I warrant ye, as their own ladies themselves.—A house of civil entertain∣ment, a bawdy-house! Why, I keep a house of civi∣lity myself, and I would have you to know Mr. Bar∣dolph—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, 'tis all one: what Sir John pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, by my truly, and so I think it ought, for if Sir John recommends you to the king—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, were I Sir John, I'm sure I would never promote such a clown as Bardolph at court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Dol, Dol, I am afraid our promotion will be at the gallows. If Sir John has any interest with the hang∣man, he may get me preferr'd, perhaps, to the top of the ladder.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is this, good Bardolph?</P>
</SP>

<P>Fanatick! the king a fanatick!</P>

<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't take your meaning, Sir John.</P>

<P>You must know then, Dol, that after having, in pure love and affection, ridden post day and night four∣score and odd miles, to congratulate him on his accession, and condole with him on his father's death; instead of bidding me welcome to court, he preached me my own funeral sermon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>A funeral sermon!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, hostess: for at the end of his discourse he order'd me to be buried alive, at ten miles distance from the court. And, to make this unnatural interment the surer, he has appointed my Lord-chief-justice his under∣taker, to see to the disposal of my corpse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Buried alive, quoth he! what, what is in all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>In plain terms, dame Quickly, your gracious king hath banished me the presence; and, till he grows a graceless prince again, I am forbidden to approach his person, within ten miles, on penalty of being hang'd, Take ye me now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Jesu! is it possitable?</P>

<P>Well, as I am an honest woman, who would have thought it? it is a world to see!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, Sir John is in disgrace; still plain Jack Falstaff and one of us! ha! ha! ha! poor blown Jack!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sad disappointment, indeed, Sir John! but, in good faith, things fall out so odd, and the world goes so wrong, and the times are so hard; that here, there, why, no longer ago now than yesterday, was I obliged to pay the lord-knows-what-all away for one thing or other: and then my misfortune to day; an angel to the constables; and besides this comes the day after to morrow, when I must make up a sum for the wine-merchant: wherefore if your honour would but discharge your score in East-cheap; because, as why, your honour knows—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>How's this, dame Quickly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, I say, as why, your honour knows, seventy odd pound is a great deal of money for a poor widow woman to lose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What talk you of losing, hostess?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir John, as you say, to be sure, I shall not be willing to lose it: for the law is open, and I know which way to get my money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad thou dost, hostess: as in that case I need not give myself the trouble to pay thee. The law is open, say'st thou? Ay, like a mouse-trap, on the catch for nib∣bling clients. Enter thy action, and I will hold thee a gallon of sack, thy departed husband will get out of pur∣gatory ere thou out of the hands of thy lawyer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir John, you need not twit me upon that. You need not fling my poor husband's soul in my teeth. He has not been gone so long; tho' for the matter of that he might have been in heav'n before now, hadn't I lent you the money Mr. Dumb should have had to say masses for him. Yes, Sir John, you have put into that great belly of yours what should have got my poor husband out of purgatory, and now you reproach me for it. Had he been still alive you would not have us'd his disconsolate widow thus. You wouldn't, Sir John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I'll be sworn I should not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, Sir John, out of charity, if it were nothing else, you ought to repay the money. Nay, if you don't, I'll pray night and day that you may be haunted by his ghost. Heav'n rest his soul. I would he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever sleep quietly in his grave, till he has made you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay me.</P>

<P>Why, Sir John, to be sure, no-body would scruple to conside in your honour's honour: but then you know Sir John (no-body better) what honour is. It will buy neither coals nor candles; nor will my landlord take it for rent, nor the merchant for sack or sherry. But would you give me only the half in money, and leave the rest to honour; so that a body might keep open house, Sir John. That would be doing something.</P>

<P>Well then. I will tell ye now. Give me first a glass of sherris. (<HI>Drinks</HI>) You must know that, after the king (hang him for a sheep-stealing cur) gave me that rebuff I told you of; he stalk'd majestically away, and left me to the mercy of the multitude: when, as I stood parleying with mine antient; mine arms a kembo thus; a knot of elbowing carls bore me down before them, with the im∣petuosity of a torrent. Lo! there was I, jamm'd fast in the midst of a vile groupe of mechanics, as if we had grown together in a body corporate: and in this jeopardy was I carried along; sometimes bolster'd up on all sides, at the confluence of several turnings, like a May-pole; and at others, wire-drawn between two stone walls, as if they meant to make chitterlings of me: now this fair round beliy taking the form of a Christmas pye, and by and by press'd as slat as a pancake.

<P>Yes, in good sooth, poor woman is made to bear ev'ry thing. She must suffer all a man's ill humours; let 'em lie never so heavy upon her: and, by my truly, some men are nothing else. But, to be sure, Sir John, you was most unhumanly used. Would no body take pity upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pity! the most remorseless rascals! they made no more of me than if I had been a lump of dough, they were kneading to make dumplings of: and to expostu∣late with the villains, would have been preaching to the winds.</P>

<P>Why did not you exert your courage, Sir John? draw upon them?</P>

<P>Draw, sayst thou? I could not come at my rapier, to be master of a kingdom. And as for good words, in return for the few I gave them, they let fly their jests so thick at me, and pepper'd me so plaguly with small wit, that I was dumbfounded.</P>

<P>I thought you could never have been overmatch'd that way, Sir John.</P>
</SP>

I wiil give you a spice of their farcasms; a sample of the gibing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellets they threw at me.

in his glass-case, offered to tap me for the dropsy; and to make us all elbow-room by letting out a puncheon of canary, at my girdle. Right, cries a third, at the word canary, <Q>I'll be hang'd if any thing be in the doublet of that fat rogue but a hog's-skin of Spanish wine;</Q> and incontinently they roar'd out, on all sides, <Q>Tap him, there,—tap him, master surgeon.</Q>—'Sblood; I was forc'd to draw in my horns, and be silent; lest the villains, being thirsty, should force the shaver to operation. The knave, indeed, was five weavers off, and so could not well come at me; I might otherwise have been drunk up alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray how cam'st thou off at last, Sir John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>By mere providence: for, after the barbarous ras∣cals had squeez'd the breath out of my body, they buf∣fetted me because I could not roar out, God save the king. At length, I know not how, they threw me down in the cloisters, where, falling cross-wise and the way being nar∣row, I fairly block'd up the passage: upon which (for they could not straddle over me) they took, another way (a plague go with them!) for fear of losing the show. And thus was I left to take in wind, and gather myself up at leisure.</P>

<P>So the world goes Bardolph. Up and down! But is it not hard now? I that have—but that's nothing. I hate boasting. It is, however, well known what pains I have taken to make a man of that Hal. Nay, you your∣self are privy to many the good offices I have done him. Before the younker knew me, he could not drink sack; made conscience of going to church on holidays; and blush'd like a scarlet cloak, at entering a bawdy-house. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstructed him in all the manly exercises. I was content to win his money, to teach him gaming: to get drunk myself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o try to make him so. Nay, setting rotten limbs and dig∣nity aside, have I not even pimp'd for the bashful rogue?
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
Such a prince of Wales! by my troth, I was asham'd of him. Had it not been for me, the milk-sop might have been crown'd before he had lost his maiden-head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that would have been a pity, Sir John, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was I first taught him to way-lay the true-man; for I knew him when he durst not cry <HI>stand</HI> to a turkey-cock; nay, a gander, of the ordinary size of a green∣goose, had it met him on a common, would have made him run for it. I went farther yet; and not only em∣bolden'd his actions, but taught him the manly arts of conversation. In the stile military, for instance, or swear∣ing.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir John, I believe, there you forget yourself; the prince wanted no assistance of you in that; for when he was a little crack, he would swear ye as well as a man six foot high.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Bardolph, you are right. I remember me; swearing indeed he knew: for, tho' but a king's son, he would, as thou say'st, rap out an oath like an emperor. But then for the quintessence of all elocution, the use of the hyperbole, vulgarly call'd lying; there I am a master, yet what a deal of pains it hath cost me to teach Hal to lie▪ and all thrown away upon him. He would never do it roundly. He had no genius that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir John, the prince never could away with lying. He us'd to say 'twas beneath a gentleman and a soldier.</P>

<P>Well, well, he will never shine in the recital of his own exploits as Xenophon, Caesar, and I, have done.</P>

<P>Why, Sir John, to be sure, you have done some∣thing.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Something! the services I have done him and his father are out of number. Methinks my behaviour, in the ever memorable action at Shrewsbury, should make him blush at his ingratitude. Who kill'd Hotspur? Did not I give him his death's wound in the thigh? Was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not I who took prisoner that fiery dragon Coleville? and that even alive! And am I thus requited? Is this the

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, Sir John, they were tall fellows: they were sadly us'd indeed: I have heard of them. But that was in king John's time, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were the Falstaffs of antiquity, Bardolph.</P>
</SP>

<P>Like enough, Sir John: they were before my time, to be sure; though Pistol told me, t'other day, that gene∣ral Bellisarius was his god father.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir John, I meant no harm. I do think you deserve to be made a lord of indeed.</P>

<P>And instead of that to be banish'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not if I heard the word banish. I was for∣bidden indeed to come near the king's person by ten miles; but I was not at that distance when those injunctions were laid on me. Quere now (it might pose a casuist, let me tell ye) whether I am thereby injoin'd to march right out, ten miles an end; whether the negative, <HI>not come,</HI> amounts to the positive, <HI>go.</HI>—I will not understand it so; and, if that be my lord ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef justice's construction, by the Lord, I will put him to the trouble of carrying of me: I will be la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up with the gout ere I budge a foot.</P>

<P>Admit it: unless he means to reside for ever in a place, and be in his own proper person as immoveable as a church, I hold my life on a damn'd precarious tenure. He must give me timely notice of his motions, that I may re∣gulate mine accordingly; otherwise, if he be travelling my way, we may happen to encounter, and I get myself hang'd through inadvertency.

<P>What! how! that my money's gone?</P>
</SP>

<P>Nay, I know not that. I say, I am of opinion you should have taken a bond, or obligation, at the time of lending it, friend Shallow.

<P>A thousand pound. I know it is, master Plead∣well, I know it well. But pray now, is there no method in the law to recover it? He cannot have spent it yet: cannot we compel him to restitution? Arrest him—arrest him, Mr. Pleadwell.</P>

<P>Nay, cousin Shallow, not so neither. I'll be sworn he borrow'd it upon his oath. He swore upon the honour of a true knight, to give him a thousand pound again; and besides that, the comings-in of a better thing, in his majesty's court at London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Law.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Master Slender, these knights have just honour enough to swear by; but, for any thing further, I am apprehensive we shall find him one of those honourable knights, whose word is as good as their oath.

And dost thou think me so unpractis'd a courtier as to return the perquisites of my calling, because I am turn'd out; or to restore the purchase of my good-will, because I am not likely to get in.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not indeed on parchment, <HI>signatum &amp; sigillatum,</HI> Mr. Pleadwell. A courtier's promise is not, indeed, very good in law. But I can tell ye the posts I should have procur'd for these noble 'squires: and by'r lady, thou wilt say they would have been well occupied. Having a little pique or so at my Lord-chief-justice, and Mr. Shallow, here, thinking himself qualified, I promis'd him my in∣terest for his worship's removal from the quorum to his lordship's place on the bench.

<P>Good day to you, master doctor apothecary. And yet I know not whether I ought to wish that neither; for a good day to him must be a bad one to some-body. A man of any conscience, or humanity, knows not how to salute fellows of such an occupation: for who would wish the rest of mankind lame and blind, sick and sorry, to find them employment, forsooth?—Poor Peto! I would not lose him, methinks; for, tho' he be a worthless knave, he is an old acquaintance; and I never could find in my heart to part with my old acquaintance merely because they were good for nothing. King Hal is another sort of a man to what I am, to abandon his old friends in his prosperity thus. Poor Peto!</P>

<P>Thou! tell me the moon is a Suffolk cheese, or a Windser pear. Thou! have I not seen thee clear the ring without a staff, at a bear-baiting? Thou might'st make thy way through a legion, nay the millions of a croi∣sade: why, who would come within a fathom of that fire∣brand, thy nose? It is a flaming two-edged sword. Wouldst thou make me believe the villains would come near thee, to burn their holiday cloaths? Thou wouldst have set them a-blaz'ng like stubble, and have consumed the whole procession of heralds, like men of straw. A plague upon them, it was by their avoiding thee, I sup∣pose, that I had like to have died a martyr to corpu∣lency.</P>

<P>Do with it! If there were water enough in the Thames, I would have thee quench it. But water, I fear, can do nothing for thee; since I remember, when we rode last from Canterbury, when the rain beating full in our faces, thou cam'st into the Borough with thy nose and cheeks glowing red-hot, although they had been hissing all the way like a tailor's goose. God forgive me—but when thou runn'st behind the hedge, in fear of the officer; I could not help comparing him and thee to Moses and the burning-bush. But thou wilt in time be consumed: thy fire must out.</P>

<P>Cold, sayst thou! thy face would condemn thee for an incendiary before any bench of judicature in the kingdom! thou wouldst carry apparent combustibles into court with thee. Tell not me of cold.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by the lord, I heard nothing on't. She sent me a letter, indeed, into Gloucestershire; but I was over a bottle, and would not interrupt the glass to read it. I knew it was hers by the superscription, which by the way, how∣ever, was as unintelligible as the hand-writing on the wall. It had never reached me had not the bearer been a decy∣pherer.

I have, it is true, small hopes from Hal; and shall grow old some time or other. These aches in my limbs forebode it. I cannot hold out for ever; that's certain.

<P>Marry, Bardolph, and I am half resolved to do so. Yea, by the Lord, and I will too. She has besides two thousand pounds in money, I will courageously make the attack and mount the breach of matrimony. If I sall into the hands of Philistines; why, good night. It is but going into purgatory a few years before my time, Bardolph, get me pen and ink, in the cupid.

<P>It is that melancholy, and the cause of it, Sir John, I would remove.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>By inducing thee to repent, and be restor'd to the favour of the King of kings; which thou hast forfeited by a dissolute and abandoned life. Dost thou not think thou art in a state of reprobation?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy ill-manners, Sir John, would be inexcusable, were it not to be supposed the consequence of an habitual antipathy to every thing that is good. But, I will not lay claim to greater merit than is my due. I am come by order of my Lord-chief-justice; who is so much your friend as to interest himself in your reformation.</P>

<P>My Lord-chief-justice! that's another matter. I cry thee mercy, reverend father. I find thou'rt not the man I took thee for. Your reverence does me honour; and I profess I am much indebted to his lordship's kind love and regard to my soul's health.</P>

<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
of life. I am heartily tir'd of it. Indeed, I am, good fa∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to find thee in such promising disposi∣tions, and think thou couldst not do better than to betake thyself, agreeable to his lordship's intentions, to some mo∣nastery, where thou wilt be secluded from temptations, and have all spiritual assistance to encourage thee to mortify the desires of the flesh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold thee there, good father. Let me under∣stand thee. What! would his lordship make a monk of me? I must there beg his pardon. A monk; and to mortify the flesh! For heav'ns sake, good father, consider what a mortification indeed that must be to me, who have fix times the quantity of any other man. If I must be in∣cluded within the pale of the church, why not make a canon of me (not indeed a minor canon) but a prebendary, or a bishop, now. Something might be said for either of these. But for a monk! I know not any thing I am less fit for; unless indeed his lordship had meant to make a running footman of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir John, his lordship will not use compul∣sion in this. He will not so far lay a restraint on your in∣clinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, if I ever find myself that way inclin'd; his lordship may depend on it I shall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations. But the lesson of lean and sallow abstinence is very long and hard, good father; I am not gotten half-way through the first chapter yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some steps, however, Sir John, you must take, toward a more reputable way of life; and that speedily too: otherwise you will be stript of the honours of knight∣hood; and the king's sentence of banishment will be strictly put into execution against you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the matter of knighthood; once a knight and always a knight, you know. The king may make as many knights as he pleases; but he will not so easily unmake them again. My title will not depend on the king's courtesy, but on that of my followers. I am, not∣withstanding, very desirous to give his lordship satis∣faction:
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
and do assure thee, on the honour of a soldier, of the sincerity of my repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet this may be only a transitory fit of penitence, owing to your late disappointment. What reason canst thou give me to hope this state of mind will continue?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, father, what I am shortly going to do is an act, that has confin'd many a man to a state of repentance, which hath continued to the last hour of his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir John, is saying something. Pray what are you going to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken a resolution, father, to—What dost thou think now it is I have resolv'd upon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some commendable act of penance, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it may well be call'd so, I believe. I am determin'd, good father, to marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call you that an act of penance, Sir John? Is mar∣riage a state of mortification?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I may not find it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir John, marriage is a holy state; and in some degree I approve your resolution; but, in the estimation of the church, it is also an holy act, and ought not to be enter'd into unadvisedly. Your repentance should precede your receiving the benefit of that sacra∣ment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, doubt not but I shall repent me sufficiently afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! Sir John, Sir John, I fear me you are no true penitent: but, however, it may be lawful to salve what cannot be effectually cur'd. I did not expect to make a convert at the first interview. If thou takest any measures that tend toward reformation, thou shalt have my prayers and best assistance therein. Another time I will hold farther conversation with thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, good father, let me stand fair in your report to my Lord-chief-justice and his majesty.</P>

<P>Pistol, how now? wherefore hast doff'd thy mask? Art thou the master of this feast? or am I thine?</P>

<SPEAKER>Pistol.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is as fortune bids, and time shall shew,</L>

<L>Sir knight, no more your ancient and base tyke,</L>

<P>Pistol, thou art always in the clouds. Art thou drunk? or hast thou got a commission?</P>

<P>Marry, Sir John, that's the short of it: and I myself was just now married to Mrs. Bridget her woman.</P>

<P>How now, you bare-fac'd strumpets! what do you mean? This is no brothel: play no gambols here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry come up, Sir John; you will not hinder my going to my husband. Mr. Shallow will protect me; my dear Mr. Shallow.</P>

<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>O ho! do you so? What, Sir John hath blown us; hath he? But no matter; he cannot unmarry us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly, that he can't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor would I: for since whores and rogues have conforted, I have never seen four better matched.</P>

<P>And hostess, truly! do you take that Mrs. Shallow?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Away—ye termagant jades: or I will demolish your frippery.—There are your cuckolds. Pistol, Nym, why stand ye there like mutes? Are you fascinated at the success of your mummery? Or are you ruminating on the comforts of cuckoldom by anticipation.—Take hence your crooked ribs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quick.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, has there been a trick, then, played on us in these disguises? Was I married to you, Pistol?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pistol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dame Quickly, thou art mine. The fates have cross'd us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I'll be sworn they have joined you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was I married to you, Nym?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nym.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so, Dol. I am heartily sorry for it; but luck hath turn'd tail upon us, that's the trick on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very scurvy trick, indeed, but I had so many
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
husbands before, that one more or less breaks no squares with Dol. Come, Mrs. Quickly, be of good chear: Pistol is better than nobody: he will protect thee, by out∣swaggering the swaggerers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pistol.</SPEAKER>
<L>Contented I, since so the fates decree,</L>
<L>Soldier no more, a victualler I'll be;</L>
<L>The martial sword exchange for carving knife,</L>
<L>And cut out viands for the means of life.</L>
<L>No more in anger fight, but joyous dine,</L>
<L>And 'stead of drawing blood, draw sparkling wine;</L>
<L>Nay, should Sir John himself my service lack,</L>
<L>At the boar's head, he'll find a glass of sack.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>But wilt thou put no lime in it, Pistol?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pistol,</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by Falernian Bacchus, for my knight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then will I be thy guest. Nay, by'r Lady, thou shalt for once, be mine too. I will not break off the thread of our quondam familiarity with so little grace as Majesty hath done. I do invite ye all, therefore, to supper with me. And if you cannot laugh over the success of your own contrivances, be merry on the consummation of my nuptials.</P>
<L>Come, spouse, tho' long indeed hath been our courting,</L>
<L>We're not quite past the days of love and sporting;</L>
<L>'Tis true, a younger bridegroom had you sped,</L>
<L>He might have been less prone to sleep in bed;</L>
<L>Yet, ev'n in autumn, some spring flowers may grow,</L>
<L>As there are lillies in September blow:</L>
<L>Youth's wild oats sown, 'tis ne'er too late to mend;</L>
<L>The worst once past, the better is the end.</L>

<STAGE>Enters reading a Card.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>THE muse of Shakespeare's compliments!—A card</L>
<L>T'excuse this evening's enterprizing Bard!</L>
<L>Great his presumption, to confess the truth:</L>
<L>But, as he pleads the passion of his youth,</L>
<L>Together with the magick of her charms,</L>
<L>Attracting him resistless to her arms;</L>
<L>Tho' somewhat by surprize, she owns, she suffer'd,</L>
<L>Yet, as no actual violence was offer'd,</L>
<L>She's willing, if the audience should agree,</L>
<L>For this one time to set th'offender free.</L>
<L>We women soon forgive, if not forget,</L>
<L>The crimes our beauties make the men commit,</L>
<L>Especially when once we're past our prime,</L>
<L>And Shakespeare's muse, like me,'s the worse for time.</L>
<L>For, tho' she charm with fancy ever young,</L>
<L>Tho' heav'nly musick dwell upon her tongue,</L>
<L>Lost many an artless smile and dimple sleek,</L>
<L>Which sat alluring on her virgin cheek;</L>
<L>Beauties, that faded on the gazer's eye,</L>
<L>And no cold-cream of comment can supply.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As for what Merc'ry in the Prologue told ye;</L>
<L>Pray, let not that from clemency with-hold ye.</L>
<L>That Hermes was of old a lying blade,</L>
<L>And practic'd in imposture, as his trade;</L>
<L>The patron he, or classic lore deceives,</L>
<L>Of cheats, forestallers, higglers, hucksters, thieves.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Besides,—to tell you a stage-trick of ours—</L>
<L>But you'll not spread the secret out of doors,—</L>
<L>The man was no more Mercury, than I am</L>
<L>Queen Hecuba, the wife of Trojan Priam.</L>
<L>A messenger from Phoebus! He a god!</L>
<L>I can assure you all, 'twas Mr. Dodd;</L>
<L>His dropping from the clouds, was all a sham;</L>
<L>And his pretended errand but a flam.</L>
<L>We've heathen gods of paste-board, made to fly</L>
<L>On hempen cords across the painted sky;</L>
<L><PB REF="75"/>Those canvass clouds, that dangle there above,</L>
<L>Inveloping the throne itself of love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His tale fictitious too, tho' told so glib;</L>
<L>For take it on my word, 'twas all a fib.</L>
<L>Old Falstaff in Elysium!—To my thinking,</L>
<L>So great his natural tendency to sinking,</L>
<L>That to the shades if he had once descended,</L>
<L>To bring him back, not Atlas had pretended.</L>
<L>Dramatic sprites (at least they tell me so)</L>
<L>Dwell not with saints above, nor devils below:</L>
<L>But, form'd th' imagination to engage,</L>
<L>During their short-liv'd passage o'er the stage,</L>
<L>As mere ideal characters exist,</L>
<L>And stand as cyphers mark'd on Nature's list;</L>
<L>To genius giv'n a delegated power</L>
<L>To form these transient beings of an hour,</L>
<L>Which, from this mimic world whene'er they go,</L>
<L>Are free to range in fancy's pimlico,</L>
<L>A limbo large and broad; which in the schools</L>
<L>Is call'd by some the Paradise of Fools.</L>
<L><HI>Feroe naturoe</HI> THERE, their preservation</L>
<L>Is purchas'd by no game association:</L>
<L>The poaching plagiary alone denied</L>
<L>A priviege, granted to each bard beside;</L>
<L>Who, tho' a cottager, to try his skill,</L>
<L>May shoot, or course, or hunt them down at will;</L>
<L>In his own paddock may the strays receive,</L>
<L>And scorn to ask a lordly owner's leave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not but that <HI>bere,</HI> the Author of the play,</L>
<L>By me begs leave submissively to say,</L>
<L>"None more than he reveres great Shakespear's name,</L>
<L>"Or glows with zeal to vindicate his same."</L>
