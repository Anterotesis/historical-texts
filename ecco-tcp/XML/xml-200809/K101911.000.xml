<P>THIS Poem is justly ranked with the most celebrated Com∣positions of Doctor Swift, Pope, Major Pack, Cowley, Prior, Mrs. Pilkington, Parnel, Addison, and Henry Jones, whose Works may be had, bound or in Sheets, at my Shop in Parliament-street. I have undertaken, at the Request of my Friends to add Annotations, Re∣marks, Strictures, and observati∣ons, explanatory, critical, and hi∣storical, for the Benefit of Strang∣ers, who might otherwise be igno∣rant of many Persons, Things, and Circumstances, alluded to in the Composition, after the Manner and Form of my Notes on Dr. Jona∣than Swift, D. S. P. D. that have not a little contributed to improve, and likewise make his Works be understood.</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO <HI>Gorges Edmond Howard</HI> Esq. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epistle to G. E. H.</HI>]—He hath amassed a considerable fortune by yarious means, and lived in tolerable repute, as a practising attorney, till he quarrelled with the author hereof; who has since exposed him in sundry witty paragraphs, pointed epigrams, stinging repartees, face∣tious verses, biting epistles, humorous acrostics, sharp railleries, keen retorts, brilliant quibbles, and anonymous stanzas.</NOTE></HEAD>

<L>LET F—k—r boast <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Let Faulkner boast, &amp;c.</HI>]—George Faulkner, printer, bookseller, and author of the Dublin Journal. He hath lived with the first wits of the present age in great credit, and upon a footing of much intima∣cy and kindness. He is well known to have been the particular friend of the Dean of St. Patrick's, and at this moment corresponds with the Earl of Chesterfield, whose letters will be published by him immediate∣ly after the demise of said Earl. He was sent to Newgate by the House of Commons in the year 1738, for his steadiness in prevarica∣ting in the cause of liberty; and sworn an alderman of Dublin in the year 1770: fined for not ferving the office of sheriff in the year 1768. His Journal (to which he hath lately added a fourth column) is circu∣lated all over Europe, and taken in at the coffee-houses in Constantino∣ple, besides Bath, Bristol, Boston, Tunbridge Wells, Brighthelmstone, Virginia, and Eyre-Connaught. In his paragraphs he hath always stu∣died the prosperity and honour of his native country, by strenuosly decrying of whiskey, projecting cellars, holes made by digging for gra∣vel in the high roads, voiding of excrements in the public streets, throwing of squibs, crackers, sky-rockets, and bonfires; by which ma∣ny lives are lost, men, women, and children maimed; sick persons di∣sturbed out of their sleep; eyes burned out, and horses startled; re∣commeding it to Archbishops, Dukes, Lords, Privy Counsellors, Gene∣rals, Colonels, Field Officers, and Captains, to fall down precipices, tumble into cellars, be overturned by rubbish thrown in the streets, in order to remove nuisances; dissuading all bloods, bucks, smarts, rappa∣rees, and other such infernal night-walkers, from committing man∣slaughter upon pigs, hackney horses, watchmen's lanterns, and other enormities; prophane cursing and swearing, and breaking the Sabbath, and the commandments; exclaiming against the importation of potatoes, and advising to grow more corn; inciting to virue by characters in his Journal, and calling upon the magistrates to do their duty.—The Earl of Chesterfield compareth him unto Atticus a Roman Baronet, and sun∣dry other compliments.—<HI>N. B.</HI> His nephew Todd, continueth to make the best brawn, and hath lately imported a large quantity of James's Powders.</NOTE> of rhymes and letters,</L>

<P><HI>To a certain nobleman, on being told he had wished for the picture of a celebrated beauty.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Fond swain, I hear your wish is such,</L>
<L>Some painter shou'd on canvass touch,</L>
<L>The beauties of Monroe;</L>
<L>But where's the adventurer will dare,</L>

<L>Let me some hints supply:</L>
<L>To Nature's stores then straight resort,</L>
<L>Cull ev'ry tint, the goddess court,</L>
<L>This pice to dignity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—First, let the cheek with blushes glow,</L>
<L>Just as when damask roses blow,</L>
<L>Glist'ning with morning dew;</L>
<L>Contrasted with the virgin white,</L>
<L>With which the lily glads the sight,</L>

<L>Her lips you may in sort depaint,</L>
<L>By cherries ripe, yet ah 'twere faint,</L>

<L>Next, let two eyes with lustre gleam,</L>
<L>Even as the sun's reflected beam,</L>
<L>Upon the glassy lake;</L>
<L>Tinge it with dye of brilliant jet,</L>
<L>Let it in milk be sweetly set,</L>
<L>Each wand'ring heart to take.</L>

<LG>
<L>Let the transparent web of lawn,</L>
<L>Be o'er the virgin bosom drawn,</L>
<L>As fair—yet cold as snow;</L>
<L>That love may thro' the veil espy,</L>
<L>What else were more than mortal eye,</L>
<L>Cou'd view and safety know.</L>

<L>But O to trace th' internal grace,</L>
<L>That beams divinely in her face,</L>
<L>How vain the muse wou'd soar:</L>

<P><HI>On the absence and return of</HI> THE THREE FAVOURITE SISTERS.</P>
<LG>
<L>Of late Love's Queen all in despair,</L>
<L>Fled through each region of the air,</L>
<L>Her graces were astray:</L>
<L>To seek them, Maia's winged son,</L>

<L>Flew for the nymphs, whom, when they brought,</L>
<L>Alack! 'twas found the urchins caught,</L>
<L>The three Montgomeries.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as their charms shone full to view,</L>
<L>The Paphian Goddess jealous grew,</L>
<L>She fear'd her future reign:</L>

<L>His sire, his fortune to improve,</L>

He wrote several books of Metamorphosis, or the changing of one thing into another, Love Epi∣stles, and Fast Days: he was not called to the bar, nor ever practised as an attorney. For further particulars see his works, <HI>In Usum Delphi∣ni,</HI> printed and sold by me in Parliament-street.</NOTE></L>

I have consulted sundry of the best critics, judges, and geniuses; Mr. Dexter, who keepeth the Four-Courts Marshalsea; Mr. Kavenagh, attorney at law; Mr. Croker, Ald. Emerson, at the Spinning-wheel, Castle-street, and others; who all assure me they don't think How∣ard's Ode superior to Dryden's. In my own opinion, Dryden's is preferable.</NOTE></L>

They were opened in the year 1757, and an hospital erected for lying-in-women.

He was born of a gentle∣man's family in Northamptonshire. In order to give his countrymen of Ireland some more intimate knowledge of him, (no author's works hav∣ing a better sale at my shop in Parliament-street) I undertook a journey to London, to collect materials for his life; but after remaining there 3 months for this purpose, I could only learn that he was accustomed to sit in a big chair among the wits at Button's; and this my friends telling me not being sufficient for a life of said poet, I acordingly discontinued it.</NOTE></L>

He exposed Alderman Faulkner, under the character of Peter Paragraph, in one of his pieces, acted upon Smock-alley stage in Dublin. He was pro∣secuted for said offence by Mr. Faulkner, and tried before Mr. Justice Robinson, who inveighed very eloquently against stage-players, and said he might be considered as rubbish or a dunghill, and brought under the head of nuisances.—The learned council for the prosecutor, also compared him unto Aristophanes, and the alderman unto Socrates; adding also, that Socrates was not the worse for the comparison. The play-house would have run with blood on this occasion, and many swords would have been drawn, had not Mr. Faulkner prevailed on his friends (who were present every night of the representation) to hear the piece out, and let him take his remedy by law; to which they ve∣ry obligingly consented.—<HI>N. B.</HI> Said Foote hath with impunity ex∣posed upon the stage, some of the greatest men, and greatest wits now living; such as the late Duke of Newcastse, Mr. Glover, the late Al∣derman Beckford, Mr. Langford the auctioneer, Mr. Peter Taylor, and the rev. Mr. Whitfield. He lost his leg by a providential fall from his horse, in company with his late royal highness the Duke of York, at the seat of the Earl of Mexborough. He was taken up much bruised, and the amputation was performed by Surgeon Bromfield.</NOTE></L>

<L>Tho' wisely ev'ry sweet you cull,</L>

But I am informed that the Lord Bacon, Baron Ve∣rulam, Viscount St. Albins, and Plutarch, have been more industriou∣in this way than any of their contemporaries, the moderns. Howard, in imitation of these supernatural wits, is also the author of a compi∣lation of an octavo volume, under the title of Howard's Apothegms, collected from Bacon, Plutarch, Sir John Fielding, Julius Caesar, The Wit's Vade Mecum, Solon, a Christmas Box for Young Ladies, Tay∣lor's Holy Living and Dying, and the Buck's Companion.</NOTE></L>

I built my own house myself, Howard having nothing to say to it, nor shall ever come within my doors, unless it be to pay for advertisements in my Jonrnal, or to buy medicines of my nephew Todd.—It may be worth while to mention a very enter∣taining anecdote (for the satisfaction of the curious) relating thereunto: When my house was building I happened to be out of the way one morning, penning an advertisement for an agreeable companion to pay half the expence of a post chaise, to see that stupendous curiosity of nature, the Giant's Causeway, about which 'tis still a doubt amongst the learned, whether it be done in the common way by giants, or whe∣ther it be an effort of spontaneous nature, and my house was erected without any stair-case; whereby the upper stories were rendered use∣less, unless by the communication of a ladder placed in the street. But upon considering my misfortune in wanting my member, and the carelesness of hackney coachmen, who drive furiously through the streets at all hours, in a state of drunkenness from spirituous liquors, whereby the ladder might be shook or thrown down when I was ascend∣ing it, I thought it better to re-build my house, and it has at present a stair-case, by which there is a convenient and elegant communication between all parts of said tenement.—It is somewhat remarkable that my house in Essex-street had no stair-case, whereby nature seemeth to point out, that having but one leg, I ought not to attempt climbing, and should always remain on the ground floor.</NOTE></L>

I could not fight myself, because I am pledged to the public for my Journal, three times a week, and have the care of the city upon me in my capacity of an alderman.

<DATELINE><HI>Killarney</HI><DATE><HI>Sept. 26th,</HI> 1771.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I have at length seen what I have long wisted to see, this wonderous lake; to attempt to describe it would require the ablest pen of the an∣tient poets, or, of modern poets, the famous painter of said lake, wherefore, I shall never attempt it:—yet, notwithstanding all the beau∣ties of the lake, I cannot think it, as a curiosity, equal to the Giant's Causeway; I have seen both, I never saw any thing LIKE the first, nor any thing EQUAL to the latter; this distinction is agreed to by all I have mentioned it to. But alas! this lake has been the death of a man, for whom the whole province here is in tears, the late bishop of Lime∣rick, Dr. Averel, our countryman:—To sum up all shortly as I can, I heard the people of Limerick, (where I was shortly after his death) say, that there has not been such a bishop since the time of the apo∣ftles; that the Romish clergy said, they should not wonder, had he lived any time, if they had lost many of their flocks.—What obligations then are due to our Lord Lieutenant, for having appointed such a man their pastor, for though Heaven has pleased to take him away, his successor will hear so much of him, that he cannot but endeavour to imitate him? I heard this acknowledged by several, as also for his concurrence in appointing that well known friend to his country, and their city, especially, speaker: from these and many other like instances of his impartial conduct, it is wished that we may never lose him;—and eve∣ry day the advantage of a resident Vice-Roy becomes more and more manifest; that from this new mods of government, there is far more likelihood that merit will be rewarded, proper persons appointed to of∣fices, and the laws supported and executed. A gentleman of your city happening to be at Limerick, shortly after the interment of the bishop, and hearing the prodigious great character of him from all persons, wrote the following lines, extempore, as an inscription for a monument.</P>

He hath for some time retired to his country seat in the Bog of Allen, where he is carrying on great im∣provements, in laying the country under water, and searching for hid∣den treasures in the bottom of lakes, ponds, marshes, sloughs, and other navigable rivers. He published a famous Novel, called, The Fool of Quality, which is sold in separate volumes, or together, at my shop in Parliament-street. There is so much variety in this piece, that the best judges agree, 'tis indifferent at what part you begin to read it, be∣ing beautifully interspersed with stories of beggars, trouts, foreign birds, and Indian' princesses. The Earl of Chesterfield, as a proof of his esteem for his fine talents, made him a barrack-master. He is a true friend to the religion of his country, and hath written many excellent tracts in defence of Popery, and the Protestant persuasion. He wrote a ballad opera, called, Jack the Giant Queller, being a satire upon the Lords Justices of Ireland, which was accordingly forbid to be repre∣sented. The excellent tragedy of Gustavus was also stopped for the same reason, by the Lord Chamberlain, being a noble incitement to sedition, in the cause of liberty. He was at first the conductor of the Free-Press, which trust he executed with great integrity, taking divers sums of money from several public officers, to prevent their being sa∣tirized in said Journal; which he did with great integrity. This Jour∣nal is not so universally circulated and admired as mine, because it containeth not such a variety of interesting particulars, intelligence from foreign courts, the Transit of Venus, high water at Dublin-bar, assize of bread, sailing and return of packets, births, deaths, and mar∣riages; not to mention curious queries, and ingenious paragraphs.</NOTE> whose novels please,</L>
