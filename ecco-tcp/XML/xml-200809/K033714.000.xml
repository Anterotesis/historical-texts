<BYLINE>Written by EDMOND MALONE, Esq.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. KEMBLE.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>FROM Thespis' days to this enlighten'd hour,</L>
<L>The stage has shewn the dire abuse of power;</L>
<L>What mighty mischief from ambition springs;</L>
<L>The fate of heroes, and the fall of kings.</L>
<L>But these high themes, howe'er adorn'd by art,</L>
<L>Have seldom gain'd the passes of the heart:</L>
<L>Calm we behold the pompous mimick woe,</L>
<L>Unmov'd by sorrows we can never know.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar other feelings in the soul arise,</L>
<L>When private griefs arrest our ears and eyes;</L>
<L>When the false friend, and blameless, suffering wife,</L>
<L>Reflect the image of domestick life:</L>
<L>And still more wide the sympathy, more keen,</L>
<L>When to each breast responsive is the scene;</L>
<L>And the sine cords that <HI>every</HI> heart intwine,</L>
<L>Dilated, vibrate with the glowing line.—</L>
<L>Such is the theme, that now demands your ear,</L>
<L>And claims the silent plaudit of a tear.</L>
<L>One tyrant passion all mankind must prove;</L>
<L>The balm or poison of our lives—is <HI>love.</HI></L>
<L>Love's sovereign sway extends o'er every clime,</L>
<L>Nor owns a limit or of space or time.</L>
<L>For love, the generous fair one hath sustain'd</L>
<L>More poignant ilis than ever poet feign'd.</L>
<L>For love, the maid partakes her lover's tomb,</L>
<L>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pines long life out in sad foothless gloom.</L>

<L>Who gave her own, to save a husband's life.</L>
<L>With her contending, see our Edward's bride,</L>
<L>Imbibing poison from his mangled side.</L>
<L>Nor less, though proud of intellectual sway,</L>
<L>Does haughty man the tyrant power obey:</L>
<L>From youth to age by love's wild tempest tost,</L>
<L>For love, even mighty kingdoms has he lost.</L>
<L>Vain—wealth, and fame, and Fortune's fost'ring care<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Thou art slave, whom Fortune's tender arm</L><L>With favour never clasp'd.</L><BIBL><HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or of Athen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>,</L>
<L>If no fond breast the splendid blessings share;</L>
<L>And, each day's bustling pageantry once past,</L>
<L><HI>There, only</HI> there, his bliss is found at last.</L>
<L>For woes fictitious oft your tears have flow'd;</L>
<L>Your cheek for wrongs imaginary glow'd.</L>
<L>To-night our poet means not to assail</L>
<L>Your throbbing bosoms with a fancy'd tale.</L>
<L>Scarce sixty suns their annual course have roll'd,</L>
<L>Since all was real that our scenes unfold.</L>
<L>To touch your breasts with no unpleasing pain,</L>
<L>The Muse's magick bids it live again:</L>
<L>Bids mingled character, as once in life,</L>
<L>Resume their functions, and renew their strife;</L>
<L>While pride, revenge, and jealousy's wild rage,</L>
<L>Rouse all the genius of the impassion'd stage.</L>

<L>Ancona was her port; the hurricane</L>

<L>(Just as your ship made good her anchorage,)</L>

<L>I am by birth of Syria; but here sojourn'd</L>

<L>This state, for its late levies 'gainst the Turk,</L>
<L>Call'd on all traffickers for sums of gold;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="10"/>Our tribe, at my persuasion, furnish'd them,</L>
<L>On rates so easy to the borrowers,</L>
<L>The native merchants' offers were refus'd,</L>

<L>Thence grew their hate. Of black and monstrous crimes,</L>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>MANOA.</SPEAKER>
<L>To prevent</L>
<L>A hot pursuit, the Hebrews here in Genoa</L>
<L>By common concert spread abroad that rumour.</L>
<L>The death they feign'd, this morning, but for thee,</L>

<L>We heard you had escap'd with some slight hurts</L>

<L>I would not rush at once into her presence,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thought like a son. But O, his vanish'd form,</L>
<L>Again presented in your living likeness,</L>
<L>Will with the strong extreme convulse her soul,</L>

</SP>
<SP>

<L>'Twas what I fear'd, Camillo. I must try then</L>
<L>To fix her fond attention on myself,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Direful indeed!</L>
<L>(How my heart shrinks even now think of it!)</L>
<L>'Tis ever present to her tortur'd fancy:</L>
<L>And we who daily see her, have observ'd,</L>
<L>Our care to give the current of her thoughts</L>
<L>A different course, but swells up her impatience.</L>
<L>You know the lady Fulvia's ardent temper,</L>
<L>How sudden, yet how strong in every feeling.</L>

<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our burning mountains, when their fires burst forth,</L>

<P>What have you heard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCELLUS.</SPEAKER>
<L>But thus much, and no more:</L>
<L>Two days ere that for his intended marriage</L>
<L>With good Durazzo's daughter, lovely Julia,</L>
<L>Was Claudio missing; two days more were pass'd</L>
<L>In fruitless search, and sad anxiety:</L>
<L>When on the fifth, some weary mariners,</L>
<L>Flying for shelter from a furious storm,</L>
<L>Midst the white caverns on the western shore,</L>
<L>A mile from Genoa, found his lifeless body:</L>
<L>In his clench'd hand was his own blood-stain'd sword,</L>
<L>And in his manly breast a mortal wound.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>And there ends all our knowledge. Proclamation</L>
<L>Of vast rewards to find his murderer,</L>
<L>Is still abroad through all the Italian states.</L>

<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Impossible: A thought so black and sullen</L>

<L>The joy he long had sigh'd for in his reach,</L>
<L>Possess'd of all that gilds the morn of life,</L>
<L>And each fair prospect bright'ning to his hopes;</L>

<L>They crush that black conclusion: nay, the skilful,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE;</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by JOHN COURTENAY, Esq.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<L>THOUGH tender sighs breathe in the tragick page,</L>
<L>What lover now complains—but on the stage?</L>
<L>No suitor now attempts his rival's life,</L>
<L>But lets him take that cordial balm—a wife:</L>
<L>And yet, to prove his pure and constant flame,</L>
<L>Still loves his mistress in the wedded dame;</L>
<L>Still courts his friend, and still devoutly bows</L>
<L>At the fair shrine where first he breath'd his vows.</L>
<L>For love, she knows some gratitude is due,</L>
<L>Searches her heart, and finds there's room for two;</L>
<L>And often sees, her coy reluctance o'er,</L>
<L>Good cause to prize her <HI>caro sposo</HI> more.</L>
<L>Thus modish wives, with sentimental spirit,</L>
<L>May go astray, to prove their husbands' merit,—</L>
<L>Or ope the door, in this commodious age,</L>
<L>Without death's aid, to 'scape from wedlock's cage.—</L>
<L>Abjuring rules, that soon will seem romance,</L>
<L>Love's gayer system we import from France;</L>
<L>Rescind politely our old English <HI>duty,</HI></L>
<L>And take off all restraints from wine and beauty;</L>
<L>While lighter manners cheer our native gloom,</L>
<L>As Spanish wool refines the British loom.</L>
<L>Had fashion's law of old such influence shed,</L>
<L>The raptur'd Claudio ne'er had timeless bled:</L>
<L>His bliss with joy Mentevole had seen,</L>
<L>And Julia's favourite Cicishe' had been.</L>
<L>The assiduous lover, and the husband bland,</L>
<L>Like Brentford's kings, had still walk'd hand in hand;</L>
<L>Together still had shone at Park, and play,</L>
<L>Quaffing the fragrance of the same bouquet.</L>
<L><PB REF="98" MS="y"/>Our varlet poet, with licentious speech,</L>
<L>Thus far our injur'd sex has dar'd <HI>impeach.</HI></L>
<L>The female character thus rudely slurr'd,</L>
<L>'Tis fit, at last, that <HI>I</HI> should have a word.—</L>
<L>First then, without rejoinder or dispute,</L>
<L>This <HI>virtuous</HI> circle might each <HI>charge</HI> refute.</L>
<L>That 'tis a <HI>nuptial age,</HI> I sure may say,</L>
<L>With their own wives when husbands run away.—</L>
<L>But truce with jest. Howe'er the wits may rail,</L>
<L>The cause of truth and virtue must prevail.</L>
<L>Of former times whatever may be told,</L>
<L>We are just as good as e'er they were of old.</L>
<L>Connubial Love here long has fix'd his throne,</L>
<L>And bliss is ours, to foreign climes unknown.</L>
<L>If <HI>now and then</HI> a tripping fair is sound,</L>
<L>On Scandal's wings the buzzing tale flies round:</L>
<L>While blameless <HI>thousands,</HI> in sequester'd life,</L>
<L>Adorn each state, of parent, friend, and wife;</L>
<L>From private cares ne'er wish abroad to roam,</L>
<L>And bless, each day, the sunshine of their home;</L>
<L>Unnoticed keep their noiseless happy course,</L>
<L>Nor dream of second wedlock or divorce.—</L>
<L>I see the verdict's ours; you smile applause;</L>
<L>So, with your leave, again I'll plead our cause;</L>
<L>New triumphs nightly o'er this railer gain,</L>
<L>And to the last our female rights maintain.</L>
