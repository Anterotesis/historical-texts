<HEAD>CHAP. I. Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s Vindication of the indispensable Duty of Cuckol∣dom, incumbent upon Wives, in case of the Tyranny, Infidelity, or Insufficiency of Husbands: Being a full Answer to the Doctor's Sermon against <HI>Adultery.</HI></HEAD>
<P>JOHN found daily fresh Proofs of the Infidelity and bad Designs of his deceas'd Wife; amongst other Things, one Day looking over his Ca∣binet, he found the following Paper.</P>
<Q><P>IT is evident that Matrimony is founded upon an original Contract, whereby the Wife makes over the Right she has by the Law of Nature to the <HI>Con∣cubitus vagus,</HI> in favour of the Husband, by which he acquires the Property of all her Posterity; but then the Obligation is mutual: And where the Con∣tract is broken on one side, it ceases to bind on the other; where there is a Right, there must be a Power to maintain it, and to punish the offending Party. This Power I affirm to be that Original Right, or rather that indispensable Duty of Cuckoldom, lodg'd in all Wives, in the Cases above-mention'd. No Wife is bound by any Law to which she her self has not consented: All Oeconomical Government is lodg'd originally in the Husband and Wife, the executive part being in the Husband, both have their Privi∣leges secur'd to them by Law and Reason; but will any Man infer from the Husband's being invested with the executive Power, that the Wife is depriv'd
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
of her Share, and that which is the principal Branch of it, the original Right of Cuckoldom? and that she has no remedy left but <HI>Preces &amp; Lacrymae,</HI> or an Appeal to a supreme Court of Judicature? No less frivolous are the Arguments that are drawn, from the general Appellations and Terms of Husband and Wife; a Husband denotes several different sorts of Magistra∣cy, according to the Usages and Customs of different Climates and Countries; in some Eastern Nations it signifies a Tyrant, with the absolute Power of Life and Death. In <HI>Turkey</HI> it denotes an Arbitrary Go∣vernor, with power of perpetual Imprisonment; in <HI>Italy</HI> it gives the Husband the power of Poison and Padlocks; in the Countries of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> it has quite a different Meaning, implying a free and equal Government, securing to the Wife, in certain Cases, the liberty of Cuckoldom, and the property of Pin-money and separate Maintenance; so that the Arguments drawn from the terms of Hus∣band and Wife are fallacious, and by no means fit to support a tyrannical Doctrine, as that of absolute un∣limited Chastity, and conjugal Fidelity.</P>
<P>The general Exhortations to Chastity in Wives, are meant only for Rules in ordinary Cases, but they naturally suppose the three Conditions of Ability, Justice and Fidelity, in the Husband; such an unli∣mited, uncondition'd Fidelity in the Wife could ne∣ver be supposed by reasonable Men; it seems a re∣flexion upon the Ch—ch, to charge her with Doctrines that countenance Oppression.</P>
<P>This Doctrine of the original Right of Cuckoldom is congruous to the Law of Nature, which is superior to all human Laws, and for that I dare appeal to all Wives: It is much to the Honour of our <HI>English</HI> Wives, that they have never given up that <HI>fundamental Point;</HI> and that tho' in former Ages they were muffled up in Darkness and Superstition, yet that Notion seem'd engraven on their Minds, and the Impression so strong, that nothing could impair it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
To assert the Illegality of Cuckoldom, upon any Pretence whatsoever, were to cast odious Colours upon the married State, to blacken the necessary Means of perpetuating Families: Such Laws can ne∣ver be suppos'd to have been design'd to defeat the very end of Matrimony, the Propagation of Mankind. I call them necessary Means, for in many Cases what other Means are left? Such a Doctrine wounds the Honour of Families, unsettles the Titles to King∣doms, Honours and Estates; for if the Actions from which such Settlements spring were illegal, all that is built upon them must be so too; but the last is ab∣surd, therefore the first must be so likewise. What is the Cause that <HI>Europe</HI> groans, at present, under the heavy Load of a cruel and expensive War, but the tyrannical Custom of a certain Nation, and the scrupulous Nicety of a silly Quean, in not exercising this indispensable Duty of Cuckoldom, whereby the Kingdom might have had an Heir, and a controverted Succession might have been avoided? These are the Effects of the narrow Maxims of your Clergy, <HI>That one must not do Evil, that Good may come of it.</HI></P>
<P>The Assertors of this indefeasible Right, and <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of Matrimony, do all in their Hearts favour Gallants, and the Pretenders to married Women; for if the true legal Foundation of the married State be once sap'd, and instead thereof tyrannical Ma∣xims introduc'd, what must follow but Elopements. instead of secret and peaceable Cuckoldom?</P>
<P>From all that has been said, one may clearly per¦ceive the Absurdity of the Doctrine of this seditious discontented, hot-headed, ungifted, unedifying Preacher, asserting, <HI>That the grand Security of the ma¦trimonial State, and the Pillar upon which it stands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> founded upon the Wife's belief of an absolute uncondition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fidelity to the Husband's Bed:</HI> By which bold Asse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tion he strikes at the Root, digs the Foundation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> removes the Basis upon which the Happiness of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
married State is built. As for his personal Reflexi∣ons, I would gladly know who are those <HI>Wanton Wives</HI> he speaks of? who are those Ladies of high Stations, that he so boldly traduces in his Sermon? It is pretty plain who these Aspersions are aim'd at, for which he deserves the Pillory, or something worse.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this Doctrine of the indispen∣sable Duty of Cuckoldom, I could deduce the Ex∣ample of the wisest Wives in all Ages, who by these means have preserv'd their Husband's Families from Ruin and Oblivion, by want of Posterity; but what has been said, is a sufficient Ground for punishing this pragmatical Parson.</P></Q>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. The two great Parties of Wives, the <HI>Devoto's</HI> and the <HI>Hitts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Doctrine of unlimited Chastity and Fide∣lity in Wives, was universally espous'd by all Husbands, who went about the Country, and made the Wives sign Papers, signifying their utter Dete∣station and Abhorrence of Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s wicked Doctrine of the indispensable Duty of Cuckoldom. Some yielded, others refused to part with their native Li∣berty; which gave rise to two great Parties amongst the Wives, the <HI>Devoto's</HI> and the <HI>Hitts.</HI> Tho' it must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e own'd, the distinction was more nominal than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal; for the <HI>Devoto's</HI> would abuse Freedoms some∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes; and those who were distinguish'd by the Name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Hitts,</HI> were often very honest. At the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>me there was an ingenious Treatise came out, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e Title of <HI>Good Advice to Husbands;</HI> in which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> counsell'd not to trust too much to their Wives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ning the Doctrine of unlimited conjugal Fidelity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>d so to neglect Family Duty, and a due watchful∣ness
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
over the Manners of their Wives; that the greatest Security to Husbands was a vigorous Con∣stitution, good Usage of their Wives, and keeping them from Temptation; many Husbands having been Sufferers by their trusting too much to general Professions, as was exemplified in the Case of a foolish and negligent Husband, who trusting to the Efficacy of this Principle, was undone by his Wife's Elope∣ment from him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. An Account of the Conference between Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Don Diego Dismallo.</HI></HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS it possible, Cousin <HI>Bull,</HI> that you can forget the honourable Maxims of the Family you are come of, and break your word with three of the honestest best meaning Persons in the World, Esquire <HI>South, Frog</HI> and <HI>Hocus,</HI> that have sacrific'd their Interest to yours? It is base to take Advantage of their Simplicity and Credulity, and leave them in the lurch at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure they have left my Family in a bad Condition, we have hardly Money to go to Mar∣ket, and no Body will take our Words for Six Pence. A very fine Spark this Esquire <HI>South!</HI> My Husband took him in, a dirty, snotty-nos'd Boy, it was the Business of half the Servants to attend him, the Rogue did bawl and make such a noise: Sometimes he fell in the Fire and burnt his Face, sometimes broke his Shins clambering over the Benches, often piss'd a-Bed, and always came in so dirty, as if he had been dragg'd thro' the Kennel at a Boarding-School. He lost his Money at Chuck-Farthing, Shuffle-Cap, and All-Fours; sold his Books, pawn'd his Linnen, which we were always forc'd to redeem. Then the whole Generation of him are so in love with Bagpipes and
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Poppet Shows; I wish you knew what my Husband has paid at the Pastry Cooks and Confectioners, for <HI>Naples</HI> Biscuit, Tarts, Custards, and Sweet-Meats. All this while my Husband consider'd him as a Gen∣tleman of a good Family that had fallen into Decay, gave him good Education, and has settled him in a good Credible way of Living, having procur'd him, by his Interest, one of the best Places of the Country; and what return, think you, does this fine Gentle∣man make us? he will hardly give me or my Hus∣band a good Word, or a civil Expression: Instead of plain Sir and Madam (which, tho' I say it, is our doe) he calls us <HI>Goody</HI> and <HI>Gaffer</HI> such a one, that he did us a great deal Honour to Board with us; huffs and dings at such a rate, because we will not spend the little we have left to get him the Title and Estate of Lord <HI>Strutt;</HI> and then, forsooth, we shall have the Honour to be his Woollen-drapers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would you lose the Honour of so noble and generous an Undertaking? would you rather accept the scandalous Composition, and trust that old Rogue, <HI>Lewis Baboon?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Friend <HI>Diego,</HI> if we Law it on till <HI>Lewis</HI> turns honest, I am afraid our Credit will run low at <HI>Blackwell-Hall;</HI> I wish every Man had his own; but I still say, that Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Money shines as bright, and chinks as well as Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s. I don't know any other Hold that we Tradesmen have of these great Folks, but their Interest; buy dear, and sell cheap, and I'll warrant ye you will keep your Customer. The worst is, that Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s Servants have got such a haunt about that old Rogue's Shop, that it will cost us many a Firkin of strong Beer to bring them back again, and the longer they are in a bad Road, the harder it will be to get them out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>But poor <HI>Frog,</HI> what has he done! On my Conscience, if there be an honest, sincere Man in the World, it is that <HI>Frog.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I need not tell you how much <HI>Frog</HI> has been oblig'd to our Family from his Child∣hood; he carries his Head high now, but he had never been the Man he is, without our Help. Ever since the Commencement of this Law-Suit it has been the Business of <HI>Hocus,</HI> in sharing our Ex∣pences, to plead for <HI>Frog. Poor</HI> Frog, (says he) <HI>is in hard Circumstances, he has a numerous Family, and lives from Hand to Mouth; his Children don't eat a bit of good Victuals from one Year's end to the other, but live upon Salt Herring, sowr Crud, and Bore-cole; he does his utmost, poor Fellow, to keep things even in the World, and has exerted himself beyond his Ability in this Law-Suit, but he really has not where-withal to go on. What signifies this Hundred Pounds, place it upon your side of the Account; it is a great deal to poor</HI> Frog, <HI>and a Trifle to you.</HI> This has been <HI>Hocus</HI>'s constant Lan∣guage, and I am sure he has had Obligations enough to us to have acted another Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt <HI>Hocus</HI> meant all this for the best, but he is a tender-hearted charitable Men; <HI>Frog</HI> is indeed in hard Circumstances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hard Circumstances! I swear this is provoking to the last degree. All the time of the Law-Suit, as fast as I have Mortgaged, <HI>Frog</HI> has pur∣chas'd: From a plain Tradesman, with a Shop, Warehouse, and a Country-Hutt, with a dirty Fish-Pond at the end of it, he is now grown a very rich Country Gentleman, with a noble-landed Estate, noble Palaces, Manors, Parks, Gardens and Farms, finer than any we were ever Master of. Is it not strange, when my Husband disburs'd great Sums every Term, <HI>Frog</HI> should be purchasing some new Farm or Manor? So that if this Law-Suit lasts, he will be far the richest Man in his Country. What is worse than all this, he steals away my Customers every Day; I have Twelve of the richest, and the best, that have left my Shop by his Perswasion, and
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
whom, to my certain Knowledge, he has under Bonds never to return again: Judge you if this be neigh∣bourly Dealing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. Diego.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Frog</HI> is indeed pretty close in his Deal∣ings, but very honest: You are so touchy, and take things so hotly, I am sure there must be some Mistake in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plaguy one indeed! You know, and have often told me of it, how <HI>Hocus</HI> and those Rogues kept my Husband, <HI>John Bull,</HI> drunk for five Years together, with Punch and Strong Waters; I am sure he never went one Night sober to Bed, till they got him to sign the strangest Deed that ever you saw in your Life. The Methods they took to manage him I'll tell you another time, at present I'll only read the Writing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. How the Guardians of the deceas'd Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI>'s three Daughters came to <HI>John,</HI> and what Advice they gave him; wherein is briefly treated the Characters of the three Daughters: Also <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Answer to the three Guardians.</HEAD>
<P>I Told you in my first Part, that Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> before she departed this Life, had bless'd <HI>John</HI> with three Daughters; I need not here repeat their Names, nei∣ther
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
would I willingly use any scandalous Reflections upon young Ladies, whose Reputations ought to be very tenderly handled; but the Characters of these were so well known in the Neighbourhood, that it is doing them no Injury to make a short Description of them.</P>
<P>The Eldest was a termagant, imperious, prodigal. lewd, profligate Wench, as ever breath'd; she used to Rantipole about the House, pinch the Children, kick the Servants, and torture the Cats and the Dogs; she would rob her Father's strong Box, for Money to give the young Fellows that she was fond of: She had a noble Air, and something great in her Mein, but such a noisome infectious Breath, as threw all the Servants that dress'd her into Consumptions; if she smelt to the freshest Nosegay, it would shrivel and wither as it had been blighted: She us'd to come home in her Cups, and break the <HI>China,</HI> and the Looking-glasses, and was of such an irregular Tem∣per, and so entirely given up to her Passion, that you might argue as well with the Northwind, as with her Ladyship; so Expensive, that the Income of three Dukedoms was not enough to supply her Extrava∣gance. <HI>Hocus</HI> lov'd her best, believing her to be his own, got upon the Body of Mrs. <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P>The second Daughter, born a Year after her Sister, was a peevish, froward, ill-condition'd Creature as ever was born, ugly as the Devil, lean, haggard, pale, with saucer Eyes, a sharp Nose and hunch-back'd, but active, sprightly and diligent about her Affairs. Her Ill-Complexion was occasion'd by her bad Diet, which was Coffee, Morning, Noon and Night. She never rested quietly a Bed, but used to disturb the whole Family with shrieking out in her Dreams, and plague them next Day with interpreting them, for she took them all for Gospel. She would cry out Murder, and disturb the whole Neighbourhood; and when <HI>John</HI> came running down Stairs to enquire
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
what the Matter was, nothing forsooth, only her Maid had stuck a Pin wrong in her Gown. She turn'd away one Servant for putting too much Oil in her Sallad, and another for putting too little Salt in her Water-Cruel. But such as by Flattery had procur'd her Esteem, she would indulge in the greatest Crimes. Her Father had two Coachmen, when one was in the Coach-box, if the Coach swung but the least to one side, she used to shriek so loud, that all the Street concluded she was overturn'd; but tho' the other was eternally Drunk, and had overturn'd the whole Family, she was very angry with her Father for turning him away. Then she used to carry Tales and Stories from one to another, till she had set the whole Neighbourhood together by the Ears; and this was the only Diversion she took pleasure in. She never went abroad, but she brought home such a bun∣dle of monstrous Lyes as would have amaz'd any Mortal, but such as knew her: Of a Whale that had swallow'd a Fleet of Ships; of the Lyons being let out of the <HI>Tower,</HI> to destroy the Protestant Religion; of the Pope's being seen in a Brandy Shop at <HI>Wap∣ping,</HI> and a prodigious strong Man that was going to shove down the <HI>Cupola</HI> of <HI>Paul's;</HI> of Three millions of Five Pound Pieces that Esquire <HI>South</HI> had found under an old Wall; of Blazing-Stars, Flying Dra∣gons, and abundance of such Stuff. All the Ser∣vants in the Family made high Court to her, for she Domineer'd there, and turn'd out and in whom she pleas'd; only there was an old Grudge between her and Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> whom she mortally hated, and used to hire Fellows to squirt Kennel Water upon him as he pass'd along the Streets, so that he was forc'd con∣stantly to wear a Surtout of oil'd Cloath, by which means he came home pretty clean, except where the Surtout was a little scanty.</P>
<P>As for the Third, she was a Thief, and a com∣mon mercenary Prostitute, and that without any
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Solicitation from Nature, for she own'd she had no Enjoyment. She had no Respect of Persons, a Prince or a Porter was all one, according as they paid; yea she would leave the finest Gentleman in the World to go to an ugly pocky Fellow, for Six Pence more. In the practice of her Profession she had amass'd vast Magazines of all sorts of Things; she had above Five hundred Suits of fine Clothes, and yet went abroad like a Cynder-Wench: She robb'd and starv'd all the Servants, so that no Body could live near her.</P>
<P>So much for <HI>John</HI>'s three Daughters, which you will say were Rarities to be fond of. Yet Nature will show it self; no Body could blame their Rela∣tions for taking care of them, and therefore it was that <HI>Hocus,</HI> with two other of the Guardians, thought it their Duty to take care of the Interest of the three Girls, and give <HI>John</HI> their best Advice, before he Compounded the Law-Suit.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hocus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you so shy of late, my good Friend? There's no Body loves you better than I, nor has taken more pains in your Affairs: As I hop'd to be sav'd I would do any thing to serve you, I would crawl upon all Four to serve you; I have spent my Health, and paternal Estate in your Ser∣vice; I have, indeed, a small Pittance left, with which I might retire, and with as good a Consci∣ence as any Man. But the thoughts of this disgrace∣ful Composition so touches me to the Quick, that I cannot sleep: After I had brought the Cause to the last Stroke, that one Verdict more had quite ruin'd old <HI>Lewis</HI> and Lord <HI>Strutt,</HI> and put you in the quiet Possession of every thing; then to Compound, I can∣not bear it. This Cause was my Favourite, I had set my Heart upon it; it is like an only Child, I cannot endure it should miscarry: For God sake consider only to what a dismal Condition old <HI>Lewis</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
is brought: He is at an end of all his Cash, his At∣torneys have hardly one Trick left, they are at an end of all their <HI>Chicane;</HI> besides, he has both his Law and his daily Bread now upon Trust: Hold out only one Term longer, and, I'll warrant you, before the next, we shall have him in the <HI>Fleet.</HI> I'll bring him to the Pillory, his Ears shall pay for his Per∣juries; for the Love of God don't Compound, let me be Damn'd if you have a Friend in the World that loves you better than I; there is no Body can say I am Covetous, or that I have any Interest to pursue but yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>2</HI>d Guardian.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing so plain, than that this <HI>Lewis</HI> has a design to Ruin all his neighbouring Tradesmen, and at this time he has such a prodi∣gious Income, by his Trade of all kinds, that if there is not some stop put to his Exorbitant Riches, he will Monopolize every thing, and no Body will be able to sell a Yard of Drapery or Mercery Ware but himself. I therefore hold it advisable, that you continue the Law-Suit, and burst him at once. My Concern for the three poor Motherless Children ob∣liges me to give you this Advice, for their Estates, poor Girls, depend upon the Success of this Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>3</HI>d Guardian.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own this Writ of Ejectment has cost dear, but then consider it is a Jewel well worth the Purchasing, at the Price of all you have. None but Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>'s declar'd Enemies can say he has any other Security for his Cloathing Trade, but the Ejectment of Lord <HI>Strutt.</HI> The only Question then that remains to be decided, is, Who shall stand the: Expences of the Suit? To which the Answer is as plain, Who but he that is to have the Advantage of the Sentence? When Esquire <HI>South</HI> has got Posses∣sion of his Title and Honour, is not <HI>John Bull</HI> to be his Clothier? Who then but <HI>John</HI> ought to put him in Possession? Ask but any indifferent Gentleman
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
who ought to bear his Charges at Law? and he will readily answer, his Tradesmen. I do therefore affirm, and I will go to Death with it, that, being his Clothier, you ought to put him in quiet Possession of his Estate, and with the same generous Spirit you have begun it, compleat the good Work. If you persist in the bad Measures you are now in, what must be∣come of the three poor Orphans? My Heart bleeds for the poor Girls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are all very eloquent Persons, but give me leave to tell you, that you express a great deal of more Concern for the three Girls than for me; I think my Interest ought to be consider'd in the first place. As for you, <HI>Hocus,</HI> I can't but say you have managed my Law-Suit with great Address, and much to my Honour; and, tho' I say it, you have been well paid for it; never was Attornies Bill more Extravagant, and, give me leave to say, there are many Articles which the most griping of your Pro∣fession never demanded. I have trusted you with the disbursing great Sums of Money, and you have constantly sunk some into your own Pocket. I tell you I don't like that Sinking. Why must the Bur∣then be taken off <HI>Frog</HI>'s Back, and laid upon my Shoulders? He can drive about his own Parks and Fields in his gilt Chariot, when I have been forc'd to Mortgage my Estate! his Note will go farther than my Bond! Is it not Matter of Fact, that from the richest Tradesman in all the Country, I am re∣duced to beg and borrow from Scriveners and Usu∣rers, that suck the Heart, Blood and Guts out of me, and what was all this for? Did you like <HI>Frog</HI>'s Countenance better than mine? Was not I your old Friend and Relation? Have I not Presented you nobly? Have I not clad your whole Family? Have you not had an Hundred Yards at a time, of the finest Cloath in my Shop? Why must the rest
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
of the Tradesmen be not only indemnified from Charges, but forbid to go on with their own Busi∣ness; and what is more their Concern than mine? As to holding out this Term, I Appeal to your own Conscience, has not that been your constant Dis∣course these Six Years, one <HI>Term more, and old</HI> Lewis <HI>goes to Pot;</HI> if thou art so fond of my Cause, be ge∣nerous for once, and lend me a brace of Thousands. Ah <HI>Hocus! Hocus!</HI> I know thee, not a Sous to save me from Goal, I trow. Look ye, Gentlemen, I have liv'd with Credit in the World, and it grieves my Heart, never to stir out of my Doors, but to be pull'd by the Sleeve by some Rascally Dun, or another: <HI>Sir, Remember my Bill: There's a small Con∣cern of a Thousand Pounds, I hope you think on't, Sir.</HI> And to have these Usurers transact my Debts at Coffee-Houses and Ale-Houses, as if I were going to break-up Shop. Lord! That ever the Rich, the Generous <HI>John Bull,</HI> Clothier, the Envy of all his Neighbours, should be brought to Compound his Debts for Five Shillings in the Pound; and to have his Name in an Advertisement, for a Statute of Bankrupt. The Thoughts of it makes me Mad. I have read some-where in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> That one should not <HI>consult with a Woman touching her, of whom she is Jealous; nor with a Merchant, concerning Ex∣change, nor with a Buyer, of Selling; nor with an unmer∣ciful Man of Kindness,</HI> &amp;c. I could have added one thing more; <HI>Nor with an Attorney, about Compounding a Law-Suit.</HI> This Ejectment of Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> will ne∣ver do. The Evidence is Crimp; the Witnesses swear backwards and forwards, and Contradict them∣selves, and his Tenants stick by him. If it were pra∣cticable, is it reasonable, that when Esquire <HI>South</HI> is losing his Money to Sharpers and Pick-Pockets, going about the Country with Fidlers and Buffoons, and squandring his Income with Hawks and Dogs,
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
I should lay out the Fruits of my honest Industry in a Law-Suit for him, only upon the hopes of be∣ing his Clothier? and when the Cause is over, I shall not have the Benefit of my Project, for want of Money to go to Market. Look ye, Gentlemen, <HI>John Bull</HI> is but a plain Man; but <HI>John Bull</HI> knows when he is ill used. I know the Infirmity of our Family; we are apt to play the Boon-Companion, and throw away our Money in our Cups: But it was an unfair thing in you, Gentlemen, to take Advantage of my Weakness, to keep a parcel of roaring Bulleys about me, Day and Night, with Huzza's, and Hunting-Horns, and Ringing the Changes on Butchers Cleavers; never to let me cool, and make me set my Hands to Papers, when I could hardly hold my Pen. There will come a Day of Reckoning for all that Proceeding. In the mean time, Gentlemen, I beg you will let me into my Affairs a little, and that you would not grudge me very small Remainder of a very great Estate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s Message and Letter to Mrs. <HI>Bull.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Arguments us'd by <HI>Hocus,</HI> and the rest of the Guardians, had hitherto prov'd insuffi∣cient. <HI>John</HI> and his Wife could not be perswaded to bear the Expence of Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s Law-Suit. They thought it reasonable, that since he was to have the Honour and Advantage, he would bear the greatest Share of the Charges; and retrench what he lost to Sharpers, and spent upon Country-Dances, and Puppet-Plays, to apply it to that use. This was not very grateful to the Esquire: Therefore, as the last Experiment, he was resolved to send Sig∣nior
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
<HI>Benenato,</HI> Master of his Fox-Hounds, to Mrs. <HI>Bull,</HI> to try what good he could do with her. This Signior <HI>Benenato</HI> had all the Qualities of a fine Gen∣tleman, that were fit to Charm a Lady's Heart; and if any Person in the World could have perswa∣ded her, it was he: But such was her unshaken Fi∣delity to her Husband, and the constant Purpose of her Mind to pursue his Interest, that the most re∣fined Arts of Gallantry, that were practis'd, could not seduce her Loyal Heart. The Necklaces, Dia∣mond Crosses, and rich Bracelets that were offer'd, she rejected with the utmost Scorn and Disdain. The Musick and Serenades that were given her, sounded more ungratefully in her Ears, than the Noise of a Screech Owl; however she receiv'd Esquire <HI>South</HI>'s Letter, by the Hands of Signior <HI>Be∣nenato,</HI> with that Respect which became his Quality. The Copy of the Letter is as follows; in which you will observe he Changes, a little, his usual Stile.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Writ of Ejectment against <HI>Philip Baboon,</HI> pretended Lord <HI>Strutt,</HI> is just ready to pass; there wants but a few necessary Forms, and a Verdict or two more, to put me in the quiet Possession of my Honour and Estate: I question not, but that, according to your wont∣ed Generosity and Goodness, you will give it the finishing Stroke; an Honour that I would grudge any Body, but your self. In order to ease you of some part of the Charges, I promise to furnish Pen, Ink and Paper, provided you pay for the Stamps. Besides, I have order'd my Steward to pay, out of the readiest and best of my Rents, Five Pounds ten Shillings a Year, 'till my Suit is finished. I wish you Health and Happiness, being, with due Respect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your assured Friend, SOUTH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23"/>
What Answer Mrs. <HI>Bull</HI> return'd to this Letter, you shall know in my Third Part, only they were at a pretty good distance in their Proposals; for as Esquire <HI>South</HI> only offer'd to be at the Charges of Pen, Ink and Paper, Mrs <HI>Bull</HI> refus'd any more than to lend her Barge, to carry his Counsel to <HI>West∣minster-Hall.</HI></P>
