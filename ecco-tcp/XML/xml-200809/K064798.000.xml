<HEAD>A LETTER TO Mr. DAVID HUME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING for a long time conceived the highest esteem for the variety of your literary merit, a recommenda∣tion from you was almost a sanction to pre-engage my implicit approba∣tion. How high were my expectations raised by your dedicatory commendation of <HI>the tragedy of Douglas</HI>; but, alas! how fallen, from seeing its representation: nor has a perusal since won me over as an admirer of it.</P>
<P>Had the tragedy of <HI>Douglas</HI> been ushered into the world as the promise of a dramatic genius, as such it ought to have been received with ap∣plause; but its having been forced upon us au∣thoritatively, in competition with all antiquity and the moderns, two obvious effects were pro∣duced in the minds of men; to wit, curiosity was excited in some, jealousy provoked in others. I am sorry to inform you, Sir, that in conse∣quence, your <HI>national</HI> judgment has been great∣ly
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>run upon here, and your critical stocks re∣duced almost to bankruptcy.</P>
<P>For my part, when I first read your panegy∣rical paragraph, I for some time hesitated as to the sincerity of it, and could not help reflect∣ing on the passage in <HI>The Art of Sinking in Poetry,</HI> written by your truly ingenious countryman Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot.</HI></P>
<Q>Take all the best qualities you can find in the most celebrated heroes; if they will not be reduced to a consistency, lay them <HI>all in a heap</HI> upon him. But be sure they are qua∣lities which your <HI>patron</HI> would be <HI>thought to have</HI>; and to prevent any mistake which the world may be subject to, select from the al∣phabet those capital letters that compose his name, and set them at the head of a dedica∣tion.</Q>
<P>But, on a second reading of it, I changed opi∣nion, and have moreover been assured, that what is written you meant, to which, in amaze, I used the famous reply of "<HI>Est il possible,</HI>" is it possible?</P>
<P>The four great and revered names, <HI>Maffei, Voltaire, Olway, Shakespear,</HI> which you have em∣ployed as supporters of <HI>Douglas,</HI> put me in mind of the statue of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. in <HI>Paris,</HI> where the four nations, <HI>Germany, Spain, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> are chained round him as vanquished, and lavishly accompanied with all the tokens of sub∣jection. However this may please the national vanity of the <HI>French,</HI> all foreigners with reason laugh at the folly of the design, and unpardon∣able foppery of the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>I respect you too much, Sir, to make any unmannered or indelicate application: such as "All fools admire, but men of sense approve;" and shall impeach you by an evidence whom I dare say will not be objected to, yourself—and from the standard of taste.</P>
<Q><P>Strong sense united to delicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by compari∣son, and cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and the joint verdict of such, whenever they are to be found, is <HI>the true standard of taste and beauty.</HI></P>
<P>Just expressions of passion and nature are sure, after a little time, to gain public vogue, which they maintain for ever.</P></Q>
<P>According to this just and admirable doctrine, what is likely to be the fate of <HI>the tragedy of Dou∣glas?</HI> Neglect and oblivion: however illumined for the present by the flambeau, you (forgive the expression,) too partially, or in the mildest terms, too sanguinely, hold before it.</P>
<P>Not satisfied to have preluded to the assured triumph of this tragedy in your dedication, an un∣provoked and congenial enforcer of the extrava∣gance of its merit, has been artfully diffused thro' the public under the title of <HI>The Tragedy of Dou∣glas analysed,</HI> a seeming attack, which the disap∣pointed reader finds to be the second part of the same tune you had begun in your dedication, and which is there quoted, in order to be illus∣trated true in every article; therefore, to join issue the sooner, we shall follow the method there∣in observed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>From page seventh to twelfth is a tedious his∣torical account of the fable, quite too long for the proposed limits of this letter, to be quoted, and therefore I refer to it.</P>
<P>The next heads proceeded to, are the charac∣ters, manners, and diction. Having nothing to object against what the analyser says relative to the two former, the following citations will suf∣ficiently shew that our disapprobation arises not from caprice, but very justifiable motives.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,</L>
<L>Who from the <HI>chiding</HI> stream, or <HI>groaning</HI> oak,</L>
<L>Still <HI>hears,</HI> and <HI>answers</HI> to MATILDA's moan.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Wherefore <HI>chiding, groaning, hears, answers?</HI> This may be founded on some tradition, or po∣pular error of <HI>Scotland</HI>; but to <HI>English</HI> under∣standings, if not altogether nonsensical, is at least chimerical.</P>
<Q><L>Thou do'st not think so: <HI>woeful</HI> as I am.—</L></Q>
<P>Woeful indeed!</P>
<Q><L>But whether goest thou now?</L></Q>
<P>Is a question in the low familiar.</P>
<P>The misplaced and <HI>Hors d'Oeuvre</HI> compliment to the union—
<Q><L>A river here, there an ideal line, &amp;c.</L></Q>
is tedious and insipid; the line it closes with flat.</P>
<Q><L>The youthful warriour, is a <HI>clod</HI> of <HI>clay.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Clod</HI> and <HI>clay</HI> are not only mean words, but al∣so cacophonous to the ear.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>To dry</L>
<L>These piteous tears, I'd <HI>throw</HI> my life <HI>away.</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>For but a confident, there is a quality-ease in this offer to oblige a friend. But she soon re∣lapses into a diction more apposite to her condi∣tion;
<Q><L>I-will-speak-so-no-more,</L></Q>
and presents us at the same time with a nasty image.</P>
<Q><L>But silent mix</L>
<L>My tears with hers.</L></Q>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Can thy feeble pity</L>
<L><HI>Roll</HI> back the <HI>flood</HI> of never <HI>ebbing</HI> time?</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Is this strictly correct, <HI>ebb</HI> and <HI>flood</HI> being op∣posites? <HI>Roll</HI> is inadequate here.</P>
<Q><L>And with him,</L>
<L>In spite of all my tears did MALCOLM go.</L></Q>
<P>That tears should have been shed rather to detain her but three weeks married husband <HI>Douglas,</HI> than an unsubstitutive brother, will be assented to by all young married ladies who are so unfashionable as to love their husbands.</P>
<Q><L>Fault'ring I took</L>
<L>An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would</L>
<L>Wed one of <HI>Douglas</HI>' name.</L></Q>
<P>This is a pretty jesuitical device, she having been married to one already.</P>
<Q><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Never did I hear</L>
<L>A tale so sad as this.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Nor any body else.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>The good priest</L>
<L>Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutor,</L>
<L>With his lov'd <HI>Malcolm</HI> in the battle fell,</L>
<L>They <HI>two, alone,</HI> were privy to the marriage.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The poet is hard run here, in order to distress his <HI>heroine.</HI> Why kill the priest in battle? Per∣haps this action happened in the days of the <HI>Church militant!</HI></P>
<Q><L>Across the <HI>Carron</HI> lay</L>
<L>The <HI>destin'd</HI> road.</L></Q>
<P>This name of a river in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from its like∣ness in sound to our <HI>English</HI> word <HI>carrion,</HI> is grating to the ears of a <HI>London</HI> audience. Why <HI>destin'd</HI> road?</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The hand that spins th' uneven thread of life.</L>
<L>May smooth the length that's yet to come of yours.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This may appear a pretty figure to those ac∣quainted with the art of spinning, tho' it does not to me. The last line is monosyllabically harsh, a fault our author is often guilty of.— To <HI>Anna</HI> replies
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not in this world.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>I should be glad to know in what other.</P>
<Q><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<L>Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill</L>
<L>As in GLENALVON'S unrelenting mind.</L></Q>
<P>On the contrary, I think never better, if he played his varied parts with that subtlety and <HI>Protean</HI> art she ascribes to him.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Blush not, <HI>flower</HI> of <HI>modesty,</HI></L>
</SP></Q>
<P>Is an odd expression from one man to another, and would be better addressed to one of the gentle sex.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will be sworn thou wilt not.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is inelegant, and not suited to the rank of the speaker.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes shall see</L>
<L>The chosen warriours of thy native land,</L>
<L>Who languish for the fight, and beat the air</L>
<L>With brandish'd swords.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>I dislike this picture of <HI>Scotch</HI> warriours <HI>beat∣ing the air</HI>; the renowned Don <HI>Quixote</HI> indeed encountered wind-mills.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>GLENALVON.</SPEAKER>
<L>And <HI>waves</HI> the <HI>flag</HI> of her displeasure o'er me.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This would not be improper from a sea-officer.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Persistive</HI> wisdom is the <HI>fate</HI> of man.</L></Q>
<P>I do not understand this line; and confess my ignorance of what <HI>persistive</HI> means.</P>
<Q><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<L>We found him lurking in the hollow <HI>glynn.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Glynn</HI> is a word used in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> but not in the meridional parts of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>NORVAL.</SPEAKER>
<L><HI>Red</HI> came the river down, and loud and oft</L>
<L>The angry spirit of the water shriek'd.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>The meaning of <HI>red</HI> here, and the <HI>angry spirit of the water shrieking,</HI> are unknown to us <HI>South Britons.</HI></P>
<Q><L>By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,</L>
<L>A basket: soon I drew it to the bank,</L>
<L>And nestled curious there an infant lay.</L></Q>
<P>Quite the contrary, and all drenched in wa∣ter, is most likely, unless the basket had been purposely caulked, from a fore-knowledge of the event.</P>
<Q><L>Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the <HI>flower.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Our author seems fond of the word <HI>flower,</HI> to mark male eminence; wherefore, pursuant to the baptismal vows you have made for him as his sponsor, (not at all alluding to the song) let him be called the <HI>flower</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>'s tragic writers; for, on this side of the <HI>Tweed,</HI> nothing more will, or ought to be allowed him.</P>
<P>The panegyrical analyser <NOTE>place="foot" N="*" A pamphlet in favours of this play, entituled, <HI>Douglas Analysed,</HI> was lately published at London, where a great number of passages are quoted, as the most exalted sentiment, as well as poetical fancy, that has appeared in our day</NOTE>, who has quoted many indifferent, has, in my sense, omitted se∣veral
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>of the most beautiful passages, which, as they occur, I shall insert in this letter; for in∣stance.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>What does my ANNA think</L>
<L>Of the young eaglet of a valiant nest?</L>
<L>How soon he gaz'd on bright and burning arms,</L>
<L>Spurn'd the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him</L>
<L>And tower'd up to the region of his fire!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANNA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mysterious nature, with the unseen cord</L>
<L>Of powerful instinct, drew you to your own.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>A <HI>cord</HI> is a visible substance; besides, this is too gross and material an image of the power of in∣stinct.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>GLENALVON.</SPEAKER>
<L>The field</L>
<L>Must man to man, and foot to foot, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This rather excites an idea of two armies wrestl∣ing, than fighting with offensive weapons.</P>
<P>Here follow other unpardonable omissions by the analyser.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>An army knit like ours would pierce it thro':</L>
<L>Brothers, that shrink not from each other's side,</L>
<L>And fond companions, fill our warlike files:</L>
<L>For his dear offspring, and the wife he loves,</L>
<L>The husband, and the fearless father arm.</L>
<L>In vulgar breasts heroic ardour burns,</L>
<L>And the poor peasant mates his darling lord.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>The cross of Christ.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P><HI>Christian cross</HI> would sound less harsh to the ear; what follows is a fine picture of decayed beauty, and some judicious sentiments.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>Arise, my son! in me thou dost behold</L>
<L>The poor remains of beauty once admir'd:</L>
<L>The autumn of my days is come already;</L>
<L>For sorrow made my summer haste away.</L>
<L>Yet in my prime I equall'd not thy father;</L>
<L>His eyes were like the eagle's, yet sometimes</L>
<L>Liker the dove's; and, as he pleas'd, he won</L>
<L>All hearts with softness, or with spirit aw'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou dost not know what perils and injustice</L>
<L>Await the poor man's valour. O! my son!</L>
<L>The noblest blood in all the land's abash'd,</L>
<L>Having no lacquey but pale poverty.</L>
</LG>
<L>There burst the smother'd flame!</L>
<LG>
<L>How do bad women find</L>
<L>Unchanging aspects to conceal their guilt?</L>
<L>When I by reason, and by instinct urg'd,</L>
<L>Full hardly can dissemble with these men</L>
<L>In nature's pious cause.</L>
</LG>
</SP></Q>
<P>The following remark deserves the attention of all men ambitious of the matrimonial state:</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let no man, after me, a woman wed,</L>
<L>Whose heart he knows he has not; tho' she brings</L>
<L>A mine of gold, a kingdom for her dowry.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>GLENALVON.</SPEAKER>
<L>She too that seem'd</L>
<L><HI>Pure</HI> as the <HI>winter stream</HI> when <HI>ice emboss'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whitens</HI> its course.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>This is strained, quaint, and affected; and what follows sheer bombast.</P>
<Q><L>He's in a proper mood</L>
<L>To chide the thunder if <HI>it at him roar'd.</HI></L></Q>
<P><HI>Glenalvon</HI> is answered with a sensible, and manly ingenuity by <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Sir, I have been accustomed all my days</L>
<L>To hear and speak the plain and simple truth:</L>
<L>And tho' I have been told that there are men</L>
<L>Who borrow friendship's tongue to speak their scorn,</L>
<L>Yet, in such language I am little skill'd.</L>
<L>Therefore I thank <HI>Glenalvon</HI> for his counsel,</L>
<L>Tho' it sounded harshly.</L></Q>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>GLENALVON.</SPEAKER>
<L>What will become of you?</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>is an unheroic interrogation.</P>
<Q><L>Thy truth! thou'rt all a lye.</L></Q>
<P>This brutality does not meet with an instan∣taneous and proper retort from one of young <HI>Douglas</HI>'s supposed feeling, which, by the fol∣lowing sentiments, is farther manifested.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<LG>
<L>To the liege lord of my dear native land</L>
<L>I owe a subject's homage: but, ev'n him,</L>
<L>And his high arbitration I'd reject.</L>
<L>Within my bosom reigns another lord;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>Honour, sole judge and umpire of itself.</L>
<L>If my free speech offend you, noble <HI>Randolph,</HI></L>
<L>Revoke your favour, and let <HI>Norval</HI> go</L>
<L>Hence as he came, alone, but not dishonour'd.</L>
</LG>
<L>Imposes silence with a <HI>stilly</HI> sound.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>What means <HI>stilly</HI> here? is it tantamount to <HI>stilling?</HI> I know the word is in <HI>Shakespear,</HI> but do not understand it, in the place he uses it.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>NORVAL.</SPEAKER>
<L>And <HI>ever</HI> and <HI>anon</HI> they vow'd revenge.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P><HI>Ever</HI> and <HI>anon,</HI> are no doubt, supposed defen∣sible, because in a shepherd's mouth, and in imi∣tation of <HI>Homer</HI>'s practice, are in p. 60, faithful∣ly repeated by <HI>Douglas</HI> to his mother.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<L>May heav'n inspire some fierce gigantic <HI>Dane</HI></L>
<L>To give a bold defiance to our host!</L>
<L>Before he speaks it out, I will accept!</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>How accept it before he speaks it out? Does not this at least border on a blunder?</P>
<Q><L>Sad <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI> still divide</L>
<L>The empire of my breast with <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>joy.</HI></L></Q>
<P>This, Sir, is an abridgment of your Disserta∣tion on the Passions.</P>
<Q><SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RANDOLPH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too well I see</L>
<L>Which way the current of thy temper <HI>sets</HI>;</L>
</SP></Q>
<P><HI>Drives</HI> would perhaps be more explicit.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14"/>The sentiments of dying <HI>Douglas</HI> are not amiss; nor is the mother's affliction ill drawn; nay, somewhat affecting. But why she should plunge from a precipice head-foremost into the sea, I cannot see any reason, nor for her, or her son's deaths. He might have killed <HI>Glenalvon,</HI> tho' previously wounded by him in the back, but, not mortally; and lord <HI>Randolph,</HI> in expiation of his groundless jealousy and rash attempt resign to victorious <HI>Douglas</HI> his rightful inheritance.</P>
<P>The prologue, a learned allusion to the old song of <HI>Chevy-Chase,</HI> is of the true <HI>poetical profound.</HI></P>
<Q><L>In <HI>ancient times</HI> when <HI>Britain's trade</HI> was arms,</L></Q>
<P>Why not <HI>pride</HI> instead of <HI>trade</HI>; but the <HI>Scotch</HI> have always sneered at the <HI>English</HI> as a trading nation.</P>
<Q><L>And the lov'd music of her youth alarms.</L></Q>
<P>The sense of this line, not intelligible to us, alludes rather to the musical alarms of <HI>Highlan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> bagpipes.</P>
<P>It would be too much to take in the whole <HI>prologue</HI> here; to read it is enough; where it emerges from confusion and obscurity, it gently subsides in kindred lines to this,
<Q><L>They knock'd alternate at each other's gate!</L></Q></P>
<P>It concludes with an humble petition in be∣half of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>epilogue</HI> is a priggish affectation; and I hope will never be relished by a genuine <HI>British</HI> audi∣ence.
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>The far-fetched comparison of the <HI>Nile</HI> is stolen. I object to the epithet of <HI>celestial</HI> join∣ed to <HI>melancholy</HI> in the last line. Heaven, by all information I have ever had of it, is the king∣dom of joy, it is therefore a <HI>dissenting</HI> opinion to make it the abode of <HI>melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>Why has the panegyrist taken notice but of three performers, and natives of <HI>Ireland?</HI> shame∣ful partiality! This appears a flagrant combina∣tion of the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> against the true sons of old <HI>English</HI> roast-beef, as if, forsooth, the for∣mer are only qualified to write tragedy, and the latter to perform. But, to thy teeth, partial Analyst, I will do my country-folks the justice they deserve.</P>
<P>He who figured in the character of <HI>Glenalvon</HI> manifested a projectile spiritedness of person, and strictly adherent to <HI>Horace</HI>'s rule, <HI>Semper sibi con∣stans,</HI> without any variation throughout: now, this is what may be called, supporting a charac∣ter.</P>
<P>The actor of lord <HI>Randolph</HI> was self-collected, having the curb of his passions in hand. He ex∣hibited a commanding calmness of deportment, and a level, stomach-fetched, dignity of voice.</P>
<P>The liquid toned actress of <HI>Anna</HI> irradiated sorrow with her smiles; how sweetly did she speak?</P>
<Q><L>Thy vassal's grief great nature's order break,</L>
<L>And change the noon-tide to the midnight hour.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>I should not have been surprised if the supe∣rior beings descended from heaven to her pretty manner of uttering this invitation.</P>
<Q><L>Ye ministers</L>
<L>Of gracious heav'n who love the human race,</L>
<L>Angels and seraphs who delight in goodness!</L>
<L>Forsake your skies, and to her couch descend!</L>
<L>There from her fancy chase those dismal forms</L>
<L>That haunt her waking; her sad spirit charm</L>
<L>With images celestial, such as please</L>
<L>The bless'd above upon their <HI>golden beds.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I owed this to my country; so now my mind is at ease. <HI>Golden beds</HI> savours of <HI>Epicurism.</HI></P>
<P>The ground-work of the play is an absolute absurdity, for either the lady <HI>Randolph</HI> must have been very artful, who had a chopping boy 18 years before, to pass on her husband for a maid; or he, lord <HI>Randolph,</HI> must have been very unac∣quainted with the affairs of women. I fear the latter case; and from ineffectual nights sprung the daily cause of her tears; and certainly a very material one. <HI>Penelope,</HI> it is true, mourned twenty years for <HI>Ulysses</HI>; but then she did not admit an <HI>apathic</HI> lover to tantalize her in bed.</P>
<P>The shepherd, the jewels, and recognition of this doleful piece, are worn-out devices of the stage, and expletive pegs of the human in∣vention.</P>
<P>The protracted monotony of lady <HI>Randolph</HI>'s grief is irksome. One character often exhibit∣ed in the same piece, must be agitated by va∣riety
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>of passions, otherwise we grow tired of the sameness.</P>
<P>After the discovery of <HI>Douglas,</HI> he is not thrown into any interesting situation, nor is there any dramatic anxiety throughout, arising from the intricacy of the plot; for from the beginning to the end, it is an uninterrupted downhill green∣sword course, entirely against the revolutionary spirit of the scenic laws, which perhaps, (nay by your miscalled dissertation, or rather disser¦tatiuncle on tragedy, it appears) you are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquainted with. We had, however, a righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to expect at least, unexceptionable correctness of stile, in a work by you so immoderately prais¦ed, not to say, profanely.</P>
<P>I now take leave of <HI>Douglas,</HI> this <HI>aurora bore¦alis</HI> of tragedy, that had so long corruscated ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us from the North, to execute the last part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my task, to wit, to defend Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> by dis¦culpating him from a heavy charge, disseminated every where from the drawing-room in <HI>St. James!</HI> to the night-cellars; which is, that he had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impudence to refuse <HI>The Tragedy of Douglas,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> best play ever acted, not only on the <HI>English</HI> stage, but on any other, ancient or modern.</P>
<P>The author not only absolves, but apologis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> by his motto.</P>
<Q>Non ego sum vates, sed prisci conscius avi.</Q>
<Q>"I am not a poet; but well read in old ballads."</Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> acquiesced to the former part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his confession; and told him that but poor mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rials for the stage could be derived from the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ter. This is the upshot of his crime. Has h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>then deserved all the foul-mouthed abuse that has been lavished on him? I think not, who am not partial to him.</P>
<P>The pulpit and clergy of <HI>Scotland</HI> are irreve∣rently treated in the <HI>analysis,</HI> which ends with a bullying line, that might waggishly be retorted, to wit,
<Q><L>The blood of <HI>Douglas</HI> will <HI>defend</HI> itself,</L></Q></P>
<P>That is, people will keep aloof from it; because,
<Q><HI>Nemo impune lacessit.</HI></Q>
<Q>No body rubs to it with impunity.</Q></P>
<P>The drift of the whole being now seen thro'; with a dislike to your partiality, but esteem and veneration for your <HI>genius</HI> and erudition.</P>
