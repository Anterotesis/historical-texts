<PB REF="4"/>
<P>INTRODUCTORY LETTER TO <HI>MR. FLAXMAN.</HI></P>
<P>RECEIVE, my dear friend, with your usual kindness, the long-suspended Work, of which I had the pleasure of re∣peating to you a few verses (as a joyous salute) on your safe arrival from Rome in the year 1794. I then hoped to render it a more early and a more chearful tribute to your improved talents, and to our long friendship. My production is not such as I intended; yet I trust, in its present state, it is not utterly unworthy of your accept∣ance, or of that favour which every warm heart must be inclined to hope its endeavours to celebrate the genius of a friend may receive from the public.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>You know but too well what impediments of anxiety and affliction have thwarted, for years, the progress of a performance that the honest pride of friendship would have zealously laboured to make more worthy of the artist to whom it is inscribed. I am yet willing to think that affliction (so often useful in life) may have had some sort of beneficial influence on this composition:
<Q>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt.</Q></P>
<P>As much as my Work has lost, in knowledge and re∣finement, by the severe trouble, that interrupted and changed its course, it may have gained, perhaps, in nature and pathos. I could hardly convert the sufferings of your dear disciple to a use more noble, than that of making them instrumental, in any degree, to the reputa∣tion of such an instructor.</P>
<P>When I began the Poem, I intended that it should comprize a sketch of modern as well as ancient art: but
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
my attention has been turned from Donatello, Ghiberti, and their successors, to the dearer juvenile artist who, after the fairest promise of future excellence, under your tender and animating care, has been destined to lose the uncommon advantages he possessed, and valued, by a length of sickness and complicated sufferings.</P>
<P>I have now watched, you know, considerably more than two years over this interesting invalide: I have seen him enduring a horrible series and variety of increasing tortures; yet in this very long trial of a martyr's con∣stancy and courage I have never heard a single murmur escape from his lips; but have beheld him triumph over the severest unmerited corporeal torments by the serenity, fortitude, and sweetness of a spirit truly angelic. In a part of this long and distressing period I have resumed, at his affectionate request, my suspended Work, and ad∣vanced in it, by such troubled industry, as those only can perfectly conceive, who have forced the mind to labour
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
with motives of similar affection, and with similar dis∣quietude.</P>
<P>Under such circumstances, you will not blame me for allowing my just admiration of your affectionate and mag∣nanimous, though disabled disciple, to alter the intended current of my verse. Writing, as I have ever done, from the heart, I have followed its imperious suggestions; and your sympathy, my dear friend, which I am confident I shall obtain, in this part of my subject, will form, at once, my justification and my reward.</P>
<P>For your credit I ought, perhaps, to apprize my reader, that whatever defects he may discover in my Book, they are to be ascribed solely to myself. As my sequestered life has not allowed me to derive from several distant friends (of intelligence far superior to mine on the subject which I presume to treat) that light which might otherwise have embellished my composition, I ought not to expose them to a suspicion of having suggested, or countenanced any
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
erroneous ideas, that a production of retired, yet often in∣terrupted study, may happen to contain.</P>
<P>To guard myself also from a charge of presumption, it may be proper to declare that, in venturing to write upon Sculpture, I pretend not to instruct the accom∣plished artist, or the real connoisseur; (two classes of men whom I ought rather to consult for information, and from whom I must ever have much to learn!) but I had persuaded myself, that, by an extensive Poem on this un∣tried subject, I might be so fortunate as to promote the celebrity of a friend, in whose talents I delight; and afford some kind of assistance to all the admirers of Sculpture, in their various endeavours to naturalize a deserving Art, which may still be considered as little more than an alien in our country, if we compare the portion of public notice and favour, which it has hitherto obtained among us, to the honour and influence it enjoyed in the ancient world.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9"/>To encourage a general delight in the ingenious Arts, and to extend the reputation of their successful professors, has ever appeared to me one of the most desirable purposes that Poetry can pursue; and particularly when that pur∣pose is happily blended with the interest and the honour of friendship.</P>
<P>Should the wishes of those whom I regard induce me, in a season of more tranquillity and leisure, to delineate the rise and progress of modern Art, in another Poem, for which I have abundant materials, I shall probably in∣troduce that new subject by a sketch of the injuries that Sculpture sustained from the sect of Iconoclasts, or Image-breakers, and the animation it might acquire from the discovery of Herculaneum, and a more spirited research in the subterranean cities.</P>
<P>I intimate these topics, to obviate any surprise that my reader might feel on not finding them mentioned in the present Work. They appeared to me as more suited to
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
form the line of connexion between the two distinct pro∣vinces of ancient and modern Sculpture.</P>
<P>But whatever fortune may attend me as the admirer and the eulogist of your noble art, that you, my excellent friend, may long cultivate and improve it, and that uni∣versal applause and increasing felicity may be justly and graciously bestowed by earth and Heaven on your labours and your life, is the cordial wish of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your very sincere and fervent, Though deeply-afflicted friend, W. H.</SIGNED>

<LG>
<L>INFURIATE WAR! whose gory flags unfurl'd,</L>
<L>Waft dire contagion round the madd'ning world,</L>
<L>Spare, in thy rage, or in thy pride defend,</L>
<L>Art's hallow'd pilgrim, Virtue's gifted friend,</L>
<L>The travell'd Sculptor, after years of toil,</L>
<L>Nobly pursu'd on many a foreign soil,</L>
<L>Hast'ning, with deep-stor'd mind and practis'd hand,</L>
<L>To prize and decorate his native land!</L>
<L>Fierce as thou art, those shadowy forms revere,</L>
<L N="10">By Science hoarded, and to Fancy dear;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="14"/>Which in the plastic soul of Genius rest,</L>
<L>Folded, like future gems, in Nature's breast!</L>
<L>To peaceful Sculpture's unarm'd son accord</L>
<L>Safety and honour for no mean reward:</L>
<L>He can requite thy favour—he can give</L>
<L>Thy dear lost heroes yet again to live;</L>
<L>And faithful still to thee, with martial fire</L>
<L>To speak in marble, e'en till War expire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, ardent Flaxman! while you now review</L>
<L N="20">Rome's sculptur'd glories in a fond adieu,</L>
<L>Now haste, admonish'd by instructive Time,</L>
<L>With filial pride to England's rougher clime.</L>
<L>The studious hermit, who, in that dear isle,</L>
<L>You left depriv'd of Health's inspiring smile,</L>
<L>To prosper your return, with votive lays</L>
<L>Resumes the lyre of friendship and of praise.</L>
<L>Dear Student! active as the Greeks of old,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In toil as steady, as in fancy bold;</L>
<L>Blending of discipline each separate part,</L>
<L N="30">Diffusive knowledge with concenter'd art;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="15"/>And adding, as you climb Discovery's hill,</L>
<L>The scholar's learning to the sculptor's skill;</L>
<L>Those years that roll'd o'er thee with lustre kind,</L>
<L>Rip'ning thy labours much, and more thy mind,</L>
<L>Those years, that gave thy faculties to shine,</L>
<L>In mists of malady enshrouded mine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think with what grief the spirit of thy friend,</L>
<L>Anxious as thine, but anxious to no end,</L>
<L>Year after year, of feverish sloth the prey,</L>
<L N="40">Has seen each project of his mind decay,</L>
<L>And drop, like buds that, (when the parent rose,</L>
<L>Sick'ning in drought where no kind current flows,</L>
<L>Feels parching heat its genial powers enthrall,)</L>
<L>Unblown, unscented, and discolour'd, fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Disease, dread fiend! whatever name thou bear,</L>
<L>I most abhor thee as the child of Care;</L>
<L>Nor fix'd of feature, nor of station sure,</L>
<L>Thy power as noxious as thy shape obscure;</L>
<L>While thy cold vapours, with a baleful gloom,</L>
<L N="50">Blight intellectual fruits howe'er they bloom:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="16"/>Yet e'en o'er thee, in thy despotic hours,</L>
<L>When thou hast chain'd the mind's excursive powers,</L>
<L>Though to thy gloomy keep by pain betray'd,</L>
<L>That mind can triumph by celestial aid:</L>
<L>From thee, dull monitor! e'en then can learn</L>
<L>A mental lesson of most high concern—</L>
<L>To know the suffering spirit's sure resource,</L>
<L>And hail the hallow'd fount of human force.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God of those grateful hearts that own thy sway,</L>
<L N="60">Howe'er their fibres flourish or decay,</L>
<L>Safe in thy goodness, with no will but thine,</L>
<L>Thy dearest gifts I cherish or resign!</L>
<L>Yet, if by storms of many a season tried,</L>
<L>And toss'd, not sunk, by life's uncertain tide,</L>
<L>I yet may view, benevolently gay,</L>
<L>A brighter evening to my darken'd day:</L>
<L>Grace it, blest Power! whate'er its date may be,</L>
<L>With lustre worthy of a gift from thee!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poets, dear Sculptor! who to fame aspire,</L>
<L N="70">Fearless pretend to inspiration's fire.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="17"/>We boast of Muses, who, without reward,</L>
<L>Furnish the favour'd harp with golden chord:</L>
<L>Yet, to be frank, though pensive from my youth,</L>
<L>I play'd with Fiction as a child of Truth.</L>
<L>When my free mind in health's light vest was clad,</L>
<L>A feeling heart was all the lyre I had:</L>
<L>But quick as Memnon's statue felt the day,</L>
<L>And spoke responsive to the rising ray;</L>
<L>So quick the fibres of that heart I deem,</L>
<L N="80">Of excellence, new risen, to feel the beam;</L>
<L>Feel the pure light a vocal transport raise,</L>
<L>And fondly hail it with melodious praise.</L>
<L>But Pain, dear Flaxman! the dull tyrant Pain,</L>
<L>A new Cambyses, broke this lyre in twain:</L>
<L>Still, like the statue sever'd on the ground,</L>
<L>Though weaker, still its wonted voice is found:</L>
<L>Warm'd by that light they love, the very fragments sound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE I.</NOTE>.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18"/>O could the texture of this suffering brain</L>
<L>The pleasing toil of patient thought sustain,</L>
<L N="90">Unwearied now, as when in Granta's shade</L>
<L>Friendship endear'd the rites to Learning paid;</L>
<L>When keen for action, whether weak or strong,</L>
<L>My mind-disdain'd repose; and to prolong</L>
<L>The literary day's too brief delight,</L>
<L>Assign'd to social study half the night!</L>
<L>With ardour then, proportion'd to thy own,</L>
<L>My verse, dear Flaxman! in a louder tone</L>
<L>Should lead thy country, with a parent's hope,</L>
<L>To give thy talents animating scope;</L>
<L N="100">Pleas'd, ere thy genius its best record frame,</L>
<L>To sound a prelude to thy future fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But worn with anguish, may thy bard command</L>
<L>Such notes as flow'd spontaneous from his hand</L>
<L>In that blest hour, when his applauded Muse,</L>
<L>Fond of no theme but what his heart might choose,</L>
<L>Appear'd that heart's ambitious hope to crown,</L>
<L>The happy herald of a friend's renown;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="19"/>When Truth re-echoed her ingenuous praise,</L>
<L>And our lov'd Romney triumph'd in her lays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="110">The Arts and Friendship are angelic powers,</L>
<L>Worshipp'd by me through all my chequer'd hours;</L>
<L>My early offerings at their feet I cast:</L>
<L>Be theirs my present song, and theirs my last!</L>
<L>If Health to him, who oft, with fruitless sighs,</L>
<L>Watches the glance of her averted eyes,</L>
<L>Those eyes, whose light can wither'd minds renew,</L>
<L>Those stars, that shed an intellectual dew—</L>
<L>If Health will yet her inspiration give,</L>
<L>Call into life my verse, and bid it live!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="120">Years that, like visions, vanish all by stealth,</L>
<L>When Time is dancing to the harp of Health—</L>
<L>But long, long links of an oppressive chain,</L>
<L>When his dull steps are told by lassitude and pain—</L>
<L>Years have elaps'd since, full of hope for thee,</L>
<L>Thy bard, though wreck'd on Study's restless sea,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="20"/>Yet aim'd to give, by friendship's kind controul,</L>
<L>Miltonic <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE II.</NOTE> temper to thy fervent soul;</L>
<L>And well hast thou, to make those years conduce</L>
<L>To future honour and immediate use,</L>
<L N="130">Assign'd of early life thy studious prime</L>
<L>To bright Italia's art-enlighten'd clime;</L>
<L>That clime, where Milton, at an age like thine,</L>
<L>Imbib'd the fervour of sublime design,</L>
<L>As emulation wing'd his soul with fire,</L>
<L>In song to triumph o'er the Tuscan quire;</L>
<L>And Tasso's Muse, with epic glory bright,</L>
<L>Impell'd his fancy to a nobler flight:</L>
<L>So may the modern lord of Sculpture's sphere,</L>
<L>Whose mighty hand to many an art was dear—</L>
<L N="140">May lofty Angelo thy mind inflame,</L>
<L>As happily to vie with Tuscan fame!</L>
<L>Then shall thy country, while thy works display</L>
<L>Force, feeling, truth, and beauty's moral sway,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="21"/>Radiant, at last, with sculptural renown,</L>
<L>(A gem long wanting in her lucid crown,)</L>
<L>Feel new distinction animate her heart,</L>
<L>And high precedence hold in every art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pass not this presage in Detraction's eyes</L>
<L>For partial friendship's weak or vain surmise;</L>
<L N="150">'Tis hope well grounded, such as heaven inspires</L>
<L>When man submits to heaven his proud desires.</L>
<L>May'st thou, my friend! whose well-instructed youth</L>
<L>Grav'd on thy heart this animating truth,</L>
<L>"Talents are power which men from God deduce,</L>
<L>"And best acknowledge by benignant use;"—</L>
<L>May'st thou, by years of prosperous study, reach</L>
<L>Remote Perfection, that no precepts teach!</L>
<L>May'st thou, like Angelo and Milton, close</L>
<L>A life of labour in divine repose,</L>
<L N="160">In that calm vale of years, by Science blest,</L>
<L>Where well-earn'd honour warms the veteran's breast,</L>
<L>Acknowledg'd (to reward his mental strife)</L>
<L>A sovereign of the art to which he gave his life!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="22"/>Enough for me, whose thrilling nerves confess</L>
<L>Sincerest transport in a friend's success—</L>
<L>For me, who hold, in life's autumnal days,</L>
<L>Private esteem more dear than public praise—</L>
<L>If I may pour, benevolently clear,</L>
<L>Incentive notes in Friendship's partial ear;</L>
<L N="170">By zealous verse uninjur'd minds inflame</L>
<L>To toils of highest hope and hardest aim,</L>
<L>Urge those I love in lovely arts to shine,</L>
<L>And make their triumphs by affection mine.</L>
<L>As when, through hazards on a sea untried,</L>
<L>Philanthropy and Fame the vessel guide,</L>
<L>A crippled boatswain, for Old England's sake,</L>
<L>By his shrill note may abler seamen wake</L>
<L>To happier service than himself could yield,</L>
<L>If yet unshatter'd on the watery field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="180">O generous passion, under just command,</L>
<L>Enlighten'd fondness for our native land!</L>
<L>Thy potent fire the Grecian arts refin'd,</L>
<L>And made them idols of the cultur'd mind:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="23"/>From thee the hero, as the artist, caught</L>
<L>Vigour of nerve and dignity of thought.</L>
<L>Great were thy wonders in the world of old,</L>
<L>When glory triumph'd o'er inferior gold.</L>
<L>But sceptics say that, in the modern breast,</L>
<L>The patriot passion is a sordid jest;</L>
<L N="190">The knavish politician's pompous mask,</L>
<L>That to the wise betrays his secret task</L>
<L>To cheat a nation with fictitious zeal,</L>
<L>And ape the noble warmth he ne'er can feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O, blind to Nature the false sage, who thinks</L>
<L>That by the touch of Time her treasure sinks!</L>
<L>The mighty Parent draws from heaven the power</L>
<L>Freely to lavish her exhaustless dower;</L>
<L>That useful pride which, under many a name</L>
<L>The spring of action in the human frame,</L>
<L N="200">Gives, at all periods, through her wide domain,</L>
<L>Force to the heart, and fancy to the brain —</L>
<L>The fruit may fail, as time and chance decree,</L>
<L>But every age and soil produce the tree—</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="24"/>That pride, the generous root of Grecian praise,</L>
<L>Lives yet, unweaken'd lives in modern days;</L>
<L>And oft it shoots, as many bards attest,</L>
<L>With attic vigour in an English breast!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, fervent Flaxman! when, with new delight,</L>
<L>Thy travels led thee first to feast thy sight</L>
<L N="210">Where Sculpture reigns, and holds her triumph still,</L>
<L>With hoarded miracles of ancient skill;</L>
<L>When first thine eyes those darling forms survey'd</L>
<L>That make the colours of description fade,</L>
<L>Feeling their potent charms in every vein,</L>
<L>Till admiration rose almost to pain—</L>
<L>Prov'd not thy swelling heart a proud desire</L>
<L>That, if pure Health will guard thy mental fire,</L>
<L>Thou, by impassion'd Toil's repeated touch,</L>
<L>For thy dear England may'st achieve as much</L>
<L N="220">As ever Grecian hand for Greece achiev'd,</L>
<L>When hands gave life to all the soul conceiv'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Feelings like these the fervent Milton found,</L>
<L>Roving, in studious youth, o'er Tuscan ground;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="25"/>Such, of refin'd ambition justly proud,</L>
<L>His candid spirit to the world avow'd,</L>
<L>When of his lot he spoke his early sense,</L>

<L>Let pert Conceit, whom lighter fancies guide,</L>
<L>The aid of Toil and Piety deride;</L>

<L>That might forbid his active wing to rise,</L>
<L>And with a swallow's flight to dart at gilded flies;</L>
<L>Pure minds, to whom the highest powers are given,</L>
<L>Own what they owe to industry and heaven.</L>
<L>Milton by ceaseless toil to glory climb'd,</L>
<L>And strong devotion's fire his soul sublim'd;</L>
<L>Meek Newton thus his modest wisdom taught,</L>
<L>"All that I've done is due to patient thought<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE IV.</NOTE>."</L>

<L>Hard is their fate, most pitiably hard,</L>
<L N="240">Who feel the shatter'd mind from toil debarr'd;</L>
<L>Whom, on exploits of intellect intent,</L>
<L>Distemper holds in Sloth's dark prison pent,</L>

<L>For strength, through Roman fanes with thee to rove;</L>
<L N="250">And pausing near the Capitolian Jove,</L>
<L>In scenes with solemn inspiration fraught,</L>
<L>Catch the strong impulse of inspiring thought!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While thou, in mental luxury refin'd,</L>
<L>Hast nobly banqueted thy thirsty mind</L>
<L>With all that art could yield, or taste require,</L>
<L>As purest aliment to Fancy's fire—</L>

<HEAD>NOTES ON THE <HI>FIRST EPISTLE.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="note">
<HEAD><HI>NOTE I. Ver. 87.</HI> WARM'D by the light they love, the very fragments sound.</HEAD>
<P>An allusion to the frequently-cited verse of Juvenal:
<Q>Dimidio magicae resonant ubi Memnone chordae.</Q></P>
<P>There is hardly any work of antiquity more celebrated than this mysterious image; a favourite object of ancient and of modern curiosity! Considering the attention paid to it in different ages, it is singular that the mutilated statue should still retain a name which, according to an ancient tradition, was assigned to it improperly.</P>
<P>This miraculous colossal figure is commonly called the Statue of Memnon, and supposed to represent an Aethiopian prince of that name, the son of Tithonus and Aurora: but Pausanias, from whom we de∣rive one of the early accounts of it, expressly says, the inhabitants of the city where it was placed (the Thebans of Aegypt) asserted that it was
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
not a representation of Memnon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>PAUSANIAS, p. 101. edit. Kuhnii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, but of Phamenophis, a native of their country; "and I have heard persons affirm," continues Pausa∣nias, <Q>that it is the statue of Sesostris which Cambyses broke asunder; and now as much of it as extends from the head to the middle of the body is thrown down: the remainder is still sitting, and sounds every day at the rising of the sun. Its sound is most like the bursting of a string on the harp or lyre.</Q></P>
<P>The intelligent and accurate Strabo has recorded his own visit (in a more early age) to this statue, in company with his friend Aelius Gallus, and a military train. He declares that he heard the miraculous sound, but intimates a doubt whether it really proceeded from the base, from the fragment of the figure, or from the artifice of persons who formed a busy circle round it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>STRABO, Lib. xvii. p. 1171. edit. 1707.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. Strabo does not assign any name to the statue in question; but calls the scene where it was placed the Memnonium. "Here," he says, <Q>are two colossal figures, each of a single stone, and near to each other. One is preserved; the upper part of the other has fallen, and, as they say, by an earthquake.</Q></P>
<P>The sagacious geographer expresses, in very strong terms, his un∣willingness to believe that the surprising sound he heard could be the spontaneous production of the stone itself<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A respectable traveller of our own country, the learned, faithful, and elaborate Pococke, has laboured to gratify curiosity concerning this
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
this celebrated image, by a very minute description, illustrated by en∣gravings: yet with every advantage that erudition and a survey of the fragment could afford him, he is obliged to leave the subject still in∣volved in considerable darkness; for among the various statues that he examined in this interesting scene, (the ruins of Thebes,) he found that two of them had pretensions to be regarded as the miraculous image<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. de Caylus has distinguished the statue of remote antiquity from that of a later time in the following remark on Aegyptian antiquities:</P><Q>Il ne faut pas confondre la statue de Memnon, dont parle Pline, avec celle qui subsiste, et qui a inspiré une si grande curiosité aux voyageurs anciens et modernes; non seulement cette dernière est colossale, mais elle est de granite. D'ailleurs elle étoit antique à l'egard de Pline, puisqu' elle étoit placée de son tems dans l'endroit qu'elle occupe aujourdhui, c'est-à- dire, hors de la ville de Thèbes, assez près des tombeaux des anciens rois d' Aegypte, et qu'elle avoit été élevée avant la conquête, que les Perses firent de ce pays; tandis que la statue de <HI>basalte</HI> que Pline presente comme un objet beaucoup moins considérable, étoit consacrée dans un temple de Sérapis, dont le culte n'a été introduit en Aegypte que sous les Pto∣lémées. <BIBL>Antiquités de M. de CAYLUS, tom. v. p. 13.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and of these he has given the following circumstantial account:</P>
<Q><P>In the second court (of the temple) are remains of two statues of black granite. That to the west, which is sitting, measured, from the hand to the elbow, five feet; thence to the shoulder four. The head is three feet and a half long, and the ear is one foot in length. The statue to the east is three feet five inches long in the foot. At a distance from it is the head with the cap. It is three feet six inches long, and behind it is the ornament of the dome-leaf. Some persons have thought that one of these is the statue of Memnon. From the temple I went to the statues, which I shall call the colossal statues of Memnon. They are towards Medinet-Habou. I spent above half a day at these statues. They are of a very particular sort of porous, hard granite, such as I never saw before. It most resembles the eagle-stone.</P>
<P>The statues look to the south-south-east, and are on a pedestal or plinth, entirely plain. That to the north is thirty feet long and
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
seventeen broad. The pedestal of the other is thirty-three feet long and nineteen wide, and they are about thirty feet apart. That to the south is of one stone. The statue to the north has been broken off at the middle, above the arms, that lie on the hams, and it has been built up with five tiers of stones—one to the top of the clinch of the elbow, another almost half way up the arm, one to the arm-pits, the fourth to the neck, and the fifth, the head and neck of one stone. The other tiers have two stones in front, except that the middle tier has three; and there are two stones in the thickness of the statue. The feet are broken a quarter off from the toes: but as I did not take a particular draught of the parts of the statue that are maimed, I thought it better to give it entire from the drawing and observations I did make. I found the height, from the bottom of the foot to the top of the knee, to be about nineteen feet; from the bottom of the foot to the ankle, two feet six inches; to the top of the instep, four feet; the foot is five feet broad, and the leg is four feet deep. The ornament behind the head seemed to be the dome-leaf, as I have it on a statue of Harpocrates. At the side of the legs are two reliefs, and one between the legs, of the natural height, but much defaced. Between the former and the great statue are hieroglyphics. The pe∣destal of the imperfect statue is cracked across, at the distance of about ten feet from the back part. There are also some flaws and cracks in the other statue; but it is of one stone, which I dare posi∣tively affirm, and in which I could not be mistaken, having been twice at the statues. I spent half a day there, and took down in my notes an account of every stone of which the upper part of the other is built. On the pedestal of the imperfect statue is a Greek epigram; and on the insteps and legs, for about eight feet high, are several in∣scriptions in Greek and Latin; some being epigrams in honour of Memnon; others, the greater part, testimonies of those who heard
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
the sound; and some also in unknown characters. All the inscrip∣tions are ill cut, and in bad language, both on account of the hard∣ness of the stone, and the ignorance of the people, who probably made money by cutting these inscriptions for those that came to hear the sound. I copied them with all the exactness I could; though many of them were very difficult to be understood, and I was not en∣tirely undisturbed while I was doing it.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far I have transcribed the industrious and accurate Pococke, be∣cause his mensuration affords a satisfactory idea of Aegyptian sculpture. I omit his discussion of the arguments concerning the point, which of the two statues he has mentioned is the real Memnon, because some ideas suggested by a later and more lively traveller of France have led me to believe that the report of Pausanias was perfectly true, and that the marvellous statue was never intended to represent the prince of Aethiopia. How it acquired the name of Memnon we shall gradually discover.</P>
<P>M. Savary, in his elegant, amusing Letters on Aegypt, has compared such reliques of Thebes as he could investigate himself, with the descrip∣tions of this magnificent scenery that are to be found in ancient authors, particularly Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, by whose assistance he en∣deavours to throw new light on this miraculous image. He falls, how∣ever, into an evident mistake, in saying that Strabo calls it the Statue of Memnon. That illustrious and accurate geographer only says, after naming a place, which he calls <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a word that may signify the Temple, or perhaps merely the monuments of Memnon, that it contained two colossal statues, which he proceeds to describe in the manner I have already mentioned. But the ingenious French traveller, borrowing, perhaps, a hint from Strabo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>STRABO, p. 1167.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, though he does not intimate
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
that he did, has ventured to bestow on the broken Colossus, commonly called the statue of Memnon, the name of Osymanduas; as he con∣ceives that the dimensions of the figure, and the scene around it, suf∣ficiently answer to the magnificent description by which Diodorus has commemorated the tomb of that Aegyptian monarch, whose title Pococke bestows on another colossal figure. M. Savary goes still far∣ther in his probable conjecture, and imagines that Cambyses was tempted to break the stupendous image by the inscription which it bore, accord∣ing to the narrative of the Greek historian; which inscription the French traveller translates in the following words: <Q>Je suis Osiman∣duè, roi des rois. Si l'on veut savoir combien je suis grand, et où je repose, que l'on detruise quelqu'un de ces ouvrages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>DIODORUS SICULUS.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</Q>— <Q>I am Osymanduas, the king of kings. If any one wishes to know how great I am, and where I repose, let him <HI>conquer</HI> some of my works.</Q> The word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (literally, "let him <HI>conquer,</HI>") is rendered by the English traveller, "let him <HI>surpass</HI>;" by the French traveller, <Q>let him <HI>destroy.</HI></Q> The latter, in his interpretation of this superb inscrip∣tion, seems to reduce it to a level with the pleasant, mysterious epitaph in Gil Bias: "A qui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcias;" and to suppose that it was designed to lead some ingenious interpreter to the happy discovery of a latent treasure. Though I presume to rally the accomplished traveller of France for his subtle construction, I am still particularly inclined to credit the conjecture of M. Savary concerning the proper title of this celebrated colossal figure, because it tends to con∣firm another conjecture by which I would account for the manner in which it acquired the very different name of Memnon. Diodorus Si∣culus, in describing the tomb of Osymanduas, and the colossal statues with which it was adorned, declares that these statues were the work of
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
Memnon Sycnites. This sculptor must have been an artist of the highest celebrity in his time; hence perhaps his most remarkable statue assumed the name of its maker, in preference to that of the monarch whom it was designed to represent; and hence, as the name of this marvellous sculptor happened to be also the name by which an heroic prince of Aethiopia was distinguished, who is supposed to have founded the city of Abydus in Aegypt, many fabulous stories seem to have been invented to account for what in all probability never existed; I mean, a sculptural representation of the Aethiopian hero (the ally of Priam, and the unsuccessful antagonist of Achilles) among the colossal statues of Thebes.</P>
<P>Having expatiated so far on the name of this interesting image, I will add but a few remarks on its miraculous sound. Strabo and Savary seem to have agreed in the idea, that the wonder was rather to be slighted as the mysterious device of priestcraft, than to be regarded as a genuine miracle of Nature. Yet the eminent philosophical poet of Derbyshire, who has introduced this fascinating statue into his delightful Botanic Garden, appears, in a note to that poem, to think that philosophy might very honestly contrive to produce a similar effect.</P>
<P>It may be well worth the attention, both of artists and philosophers, to consider how far it may be possible and proper to engage the sense of hearing as an assistant to enhance the pleasure of sight, when that plea∣sure arises from any grand work of Art. Antiquity has proved that the picture of a battle may be exhibited to advantage with an accom∣paniment of martial music; and perhaps in a great naval monument, it would be easy to introduce, and conceal such works of musical me∣chanism as might occasionally increase, in a most powerful degree, the delight arising from such a spectacle.</P>
<P>I cannot quit the statue of Memnon without mentioning the most il∣lustrious of his ancient visitors. These were the emperor Hadrian with
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
his empress Sabina, and a prince perhaps not less accomplished, and certainly more amiable than Hadrian, that deserving idol of the Roman people, Germanicus! The historian Tacitus, who has recorded the visit of the latter to this attractive statue, says not a syllable expressive of his own opinion concerning the miraculous sound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ceterum Germanicus aliis quoque miraculis intendit animum; quorum praecipua fuere Memnonis sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea effigies, ubi radiis solis icta est vocalem sonum reddens.</Q> TACITUS.</NOTE>. I confess myself in∣clined to imagine that the marvel originated in the avaricious ingenuity of those who were engaged in shewing this celebrated spectacle: but a different opinion was entertained by a modern writer on statues, whose authority is so respectable, that I shall submit to the reader his more candid ideas on this interesting image. The Abbé Comte de Guasco, whose learned and elegant historical essay, "De l'Usage des Statues," I shall have very frequent occasion to cite and to applaud, speaks of this figure in his chapter on the prodigies and miracles attributed to statues. He describes it as a statue raised to Memnon by Amenophis the Second, on the banks of the Nile; and after noticing the incredulity of Strabo, he says in a note, which I shall transcribe, that modern travellers had assured him they had been witnesses of the phenomenon, which, in his opinion, may be fairly and naturally explained by atmospherical in∣fluence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Des voyageurs modernes m'ont assuré avoir été temoins de ce phénomene. Il n'est pas étonnant que dans des siècles où la croyance en la divinité du soleil étoit dominante, il fût regardé comme surnaturel, et que ce bruit fût trouvé harmonieux. Mais dans un tems où la physique est mieux connue, il s'expliquera naturellement. La raréfaction de l'atmosphere et la dilatation des solides causée par la chaleur des rayons du soleil, peuvent fournir d'autres examples de cette nature, et ils ne seront point embellis par la prevention que fait naitre la superstition.</Q> De l'Usage des Statues, p. 174.</NOTE>.</P>

Few literary inva∣lids can fail to feel themselves soothed, and encouraged to struggle with calamity, by the touching description which Zimmerman has given to the world of his own sufferings, and those of his learned and accom∣plished friends, Garve and Mendelsohn, in his beneficent Essay on Soli∣tude. Some readers, indeed, are so fastidious as to think that infirmity and affliction should on no occasion obtrude their private grievances (past or present) on the eye of the public: but every writer who records, with the eloquence of real sensibility, calamities that he has encountered with any degree of success, is certainly a friend to suffering humanity; as his record may furnish present or future fellow-sufferers with a fresh incentive to fortitude or exertion; and the general sympathy of Nature will probably make him ample amends for any accidental censure that he may happen to incur from unfeeling individuals.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE I. Ver. 42.</HI> THE fav'rite idol of benighted zeal.</HEAD>
<P>An ingenious foreigner, who has added extensive learning to a lively imagination, and who published, in our country, a work of consider∣able magnitude on the origin and progress of the Arts, indulges a con∣jecture that the head of the Urus, or savage bull, was the earliest work of sculpture. This idea struck him so forcibly, that he has endeavoured to display and confirm a conjecture, not very probable, in the two fol∣lowing passages of his elaborate and amusing researches:</P>
<Q>Ces observations nous decouvrent la marche de la sculpture, et celle de la théologie des anciens. Cette théologie admettant d'abord un Etre Suprême, qu'elle regarda comme la pere invisible de toutes choses, le représenta par l'emblême du boeuf sauvage. Le terme Tho, ou Théo, exprimant cet animal produisit le mot Théos, d'où vint celui
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
de Deus, qui signifia Dieu; parceque son emblême fût primitivement représenté sous la forme de l'individu dont ce mot étoit le nom. La sculpture en imitant la figure de cet animal, rendit l'idée de la thé∣ologie. Cette idée préscrivit l'objet qui fit peut-être decouvrir cet art ingenieux, ou du moins qui encouragea ces premiers essais.—<BIBL><HI>Recherches sur l'Origine, l'Esprit, et les Progres des Arts, tom</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 145.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The author says, in the same volume, where he labours to strengthen his conjecture by the authority of very early medals,</P>
<Q>Ces médailles, frappées dans l'orient par un peuple Scythe, nous représentent la figure du boeuf à tête humaine, telle qu'on l'avoit dans un pais très voisin de celui dont elle vint, et chez les descendans d'un peuple qui le premier employa cette emblême. Il passa delà dans la Grece, dans la Sicile, et dans l'Italie, ou on le voit si frequemment représenté sur les médailles de Gela, d'Agrigente, de Naples, et de tant d'autres villes, repandues dans toutes les parties de la Grece. S'il est vrai, comme je le crois, que cette figure fût le principe de celles des autres dieux, représentés sous la forme humaine, elle doit être regardée comme le germe et le premier pasde la sculpture.—<BIBL>P. 177.</BIBL></Q>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE II. Ver. 48.</HI> The new attraction of a modell'd face.</HEAD>
<P>Two respectable writers of antiquity, the philosopher Athenagoras, and the naturalist Pliny, agree in deriving the art of modelling from the celebrated though anonymous Maid of Corinth, whose father Dibu∣tades, a potter, was so pleased with the ingenuity of his daughter, in drawing the shade of her sleeping lover, by lamp-light, on a wall, that he is said to have filled her outline with clay, and, hardening it with
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
the rest of his earthen-ware, to have thus produced a bust, or a me∣dallion, (for it might be either,) which was preserved at Corinth as a curious rudiment of art, till that city was destroyed by Mummius, according to a tradition mentioned by Pliny<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Fingere ex argilla similitudines, Dibutades Sicyonius Figulus primus invenit Corinthi filiae operâ; quae capta amore juvenis, illo abeunte peregre, umbram ex facie ejus ad lu∣cernam in pariete lineis circumscripsit: quibus pater ejus impressa argilla typum fecit, &amp; cum caeteris fictilibus induratum igni proposuit; eumque servatum in Nymphaeo donec Co∣rinthum Mummius everteret tradunt. <BIBL>PLIN. lib. 35. cap. 12.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

<P>From the energy of those inventive passions, love and grief, we might be induced to suppose that the earliest efforts of rude sculpture would be such as they suggested for the purpose of obtaining a resem∣blance, however imperfect, of some mortal infinitely beloved or re∣gretted: but history proves that superstitious fear is a passion still more creative; and in Greece, which may be considered as the home, though not the native climate of Sculpture, it is evident that endeavours to represent different divinities by the rudest symbols preceded every at∣tempt to express human features by any kind of model. Stocks and stones were confessedly worshipped as celestial powers, in that land of ingenuity, before any thing like a statue, bust, or medallion appeared. The trunk of an old tree was solemnly preserved by the Thespians, and idolized as their Juno<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clemens Alexandrinus, who gives a similar account of several ancient idols, informs us that these rude symbols were gradually exchanged for statues of the human form, which ac∣quired the appellation <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. But stones, of a cubic form, were their more general symbols; and Pausanias mentions a collection of these at Pharae in Achaia, in number about thirty, and each distinguished by the name of a particular divinity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>PAUSANIAS, p. 579.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. They stood near a statue of Mercury, and were probably regarded, in the age of Pausanias, as curious reliques of that ancient mode of worship which, according to his account, had been prevalent among all the Greeks.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="192"/>At Orchomenos, the favourite seat of the Graces, so happily cele∣brated by Pindar, those interesting divinities were originally represented by three white stones. When a rude symbol was exchanged, in pro∣cess of time, for a more refined image, the Greeks were solicitous to preserve some idea of the original type; a practice well illustrated by D'Hancarville, in his remark on these memorable symbols that first re∣presented the Graces. He imagines that the union of the symbols gave rise to the attitude which these patronesses of Grecian art assumed in their subsequent form:</P>
<Q>L'union des trois pierres blanches, qui indiquoient les Graces à Orchomene, fut conservée lorsque la sculpture convertit ces pierres en statues, le point par où elles se touchoient devint la main par laquelle chacune d'elles se reposa sur les bras de l'autre, tandis que de celle qu'elles avoient libre, elles tinrent les attributs qui les distinguoient. Cette attitude charmante continua d'indiquer l'avantage qu'elles se pretent l'une à l'autre, l'harmonie qui les rend inseparables, et le plaisir qu'elles procurent par leur union. Telles on les voit sur les médailles, sur beaucoup de pierres gravées, dans un petit groupe qui appartient à la maison de Borghèse, mais particulierement dans les an∣tiquites d'Herculaneum.

In contemplating the great contrast be∣tween such objects of popular veneration and the works of Phidias and Praxiteles, the mind takes a generous delight in the progressive powers of human ingenuity. The pleasure we naturally feel in such a contrast has induced many writers to investigate, with great labour, the ob∣scure origin of different arts. M. D'Hancarville, in the ingenious dis∣sertations

prefixed to his Etruscan Antiquities, has endeavoured to trace the rise and early progress of sculpture through many centuries of dark∣ness prior to the age of Daedalus; a period with which the active en∣thusiasm of Winkelman had seemed to satisfy itself, in his elaborate and animated History of Ancient Art.</P>
<P>If the conjectures of a writer may be trusted, who ventures to deli∣neate a period so very distant and dark, the origin of Grecian sculpture may be assigned to the reign of Apis, the successor of Phoroneus, about 1778 years before the Christian aera<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ainsi l'invention de la statuaire remonte jusqu'au tems de cet Apis qui finit vers l'an 3932 de la période Julienne, a-peu-près mil sept cent soixante dix huit ans avant la nais∣sance de Jesus Christ. <BIBL>D'HANCARVILLE, Antiq. Etrus. tom. iii. p. 21.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and according to a very reasonable supposition of M. D'Hancarville, this delightful and difficult art was more than a thousand years in proceeding, by insensible degrees, from a state of rude barbarity to its period of exquisite perfection. Of its most remarkable steps, and of many memorable artists who particu∣larly contributed to its advancement, I shall speak in subsequent notes. I return to the immediate subject of this,—the disposition to fond idola∣try in an afflicted parent. Two striking, though very different charac∣ters of the ancient world are remarkable examples of this disposition— Nimrod and Cicero. The strong feelings of nature, on the loss of a beloved child, produced the same wildness of affectionate fancy in the imperial hunter and in the republican philosopher. Those who recol∣lect the infinite tenderness with which the great Roman orator speaks, in his Letters, of his darling Tullia, will forgive and pity the unhappy father, whose excess of affliction led him so far to forget his own philo∣sophical principles as to think very seriously of building, not a tomb, but a temple, to his departed child, as a proper object of worship. The Abbé Mongault has clearly ascertained this intention of Cicero, in his interesting remarks on the Fanum Tulliae, in the Memoirs of the French Academy.</P>

The respectable Lactantius, in particular, allows him his existence and his ingenuity, but describes him as employing his rare powers to the basest of purposes, to promote the preposterous ambition of his relation Jupiter; and as contriving, by his sculptural art, to convert the tyrant into a god<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Stultus igitur et amens, qui adorat quod ipse fabricavit, cujus artificii detestabilis et in∣epti auctor fuit Prometheus, patruo Jovis Japeto natus.

<P>Of an interesting character, so long the sport and victim of fancy, fable, and conjecture, it is natural to desire, but very difficult to obtain, a simple, rational history. Who shall solve the doubt whether Pro∣metheus really existed or not? He has been called a Cretan, an Aegyptian, a Scythian; and Olaus Rudbecke, in that marvellous work of extensive erudition and fanciful ingenuity, his Atlantica, seems inclined to make him a Swede, and claim him for a countryman with the rest of the Titans. Of our own modern writers, Lord Bacon and Mr. Bryant (two respectable names) agree with the emperor Julian in their inclina∣tion to melt this primaeval artist into a mere allegory. I confess myself rather inclined to the opinion of the learned and intelligent Brucker, who, in his elaborate and candid History of Philosophy, has very mo∣destly stated such conjectures of his own, concerning this celebrated personage, as account, in a very probable manner, for all his fabu∣lous adventures. This author imagines that Prometheus was a servant, high in the confidence of Osiris, an Aegyptian monarch, who ventur∣ing, without the permission of his sovereign, to communicate the arts of Aegypt to the ruder Greeks, was imprisoned for that offence, and tormented, till the Aegyptian officer who guarded him was slain by Her∣cules,
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
and the prisoner set free<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Dicemus tamen, quod nobis hac de re in mentem venerit.

<P>Before I dismiss Prometheus, let me observe, that if we believe him to have existed, we may still acquit him of the offence that Lactantius imputes to him. He was certainly not the first mortal who induced his fellow-creatures to worship an idol of the human shape. Cedrenus as∣serts that Serug and Terah, the progenitors of Abraham, were both makers of images; and adds, that Abraham burnt the idols of Terah his father<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>.

<P>The following works of public magnificence are ascribed to Semi∣ramis:</P>
<Q>She built likewise two palaces at each end of the bridge upon the bank of the river (Euphrates). That on the west had an high and stately wall, made of a round circumference, upon which were pour∣trayed in the bricks, before they were burnt, all sorts of living crea∣tures, as if it were to the life, laid with great art, in curious colours. This wall was in circuit forty furlongs, three hundred bricks thick, and in height (as Ctesias says) a hundred yards, upon which were turrets a hundred and forty yards high. The third and most in∣ward wall immediately surrounded the palace thirty furlongs in com∣pass, and far surmounted the middle wall both in height and thick∣ness; and on this wall and the towers were represented the shapes of all sorts of living creatures, artificially expressed in most lively co∣lours. Especially was represented a general hunting of all sorts of wild beasts, each four cubits high and upwards. Amongst these was to be seen Semiramis on horseback, striking a leopard through with a dart; and next to her, her husband Ninus in close fight with a lion, piercing him with his lance. This palace far excelled that on the other side of the river, both in greatness and adornments; for the outmost wall of that (made of well-burnt brick) was but thirty furlongs in compass. Instead of the curious portraiture of beasts, there were the brazen statues of Ninus and Semiramis, the great officers, and of Jupiter, whom the Babylonians call Belus, and likewise armies drawn up in battalia; and divers sorts of hunting were there represented, to
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
the great diversion and pleasure of the beholders. In the middle of the city she built a temple to Jupiter, whom the Babylonians call Belus. Upon the top she placed three statues, of beaten gold, of Jupiter, Juno, and Rhea. That of Jupiter stood upright, in the posture as if he were walking. He was forty feet in height, and weighed a thousand Babylonish talents. The statue of Rhea was of the same weight, sitting on a golden throne, having two lions standing on either side, one at her knees, and near to them two exceeding great serpents of silver, weighing thirty talents apiece. Here likewise the image of Juno stood upright, and weighed eight hundred talents, grasping a serpent by the head in her right hand, and holding a sceptre, adorned with precious stones, in her left.

<P>Such are the wonders of early art which Diodorus has recorded as the works of Semiramis, on the authority of Ctesias, a native of Cnidos, who became the favourite physician of a Persian monarch, Artaxerxes Mnemon, and in that situation had better opportunities of acquiring historical information concerning the antiquities of Asia, than his coun∣trymen in general possessed. Of Ctesias's extensive writings only a few fragments remain, which are printed as a supplement to Herodotus, in the best editions of that historian. The credit of Ctesias has been se∣verely attacked, both by ancient and modern writers; but M. Freret vindicates his veracity in several particulars, like a very able advocate, in more than one of his elaborate dissertations on points of ancient history, inserted in the Memoirs of the French Academy. The kind of credit that we may rationally give to the curious description that I have cited, seems to be very candidly ascertained by the Abbé Guasco, who thinks that although works of such magnificence were hardly executed at a period so early as that assigned to Semiramis, yet it is probable that such actually appeared in Babylon in later ages, but before art had made
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
any considerable progress in Greece or in Aegypt. <Q>Quelque exagerée qu'on a raison de croire la description que fait Ctesias des monumens de l'art statuaire qui ornoient les palais et le temple, pretendus bâtis par l'ancienne Semiramis, quelqu' anachronisme que l'on suppose à juste titre, dans les époques données par cet auteur fabuleux à ces monumens: il n'en resulte pas moins que cet art avoit déjà fait de grands progrès en Asie durant les anciennes monarchies de Ninive, et de Babylone; car aucun art ne produit de grands monumens tout-à-coup, et ce n'est que successivement qu'il atteint certains degrès de perfection. Donc quoique les statues de Belus, de Semiramis, de Ninus, avec tout le brillant cortege et appareil, qui les accompa∣gnoient, ne fussent pas des productions d'une époque si reculée, mais des monumens posterieurs, executés sous quelqu'un de leurs suc∣cesseurs du même nom, qui voulut immortaliser par là les fondateurs de leurs monarchies, il n'est pas moins constant, que ces monumens surpassoient en elegance et peut-être en antiquité, les premiers que l'on connoisse dans la Greee, et peut-être même ceux d'Aegypte: ils sont tout au moins des indicés que l'on s'étoit déjà exercé depuis long∣tems dans ces sortes d'ouvrages.</Q></P>
<P>The same respectable author observes that Josephus and Herodotus attribute, with more reason, these embellishments of Babylon to Nebu∣chodonosor, and Nitocris his wife; and that their account is confirmed by what the prophet Daniel has said concerning the statues of gold and silver which adorned the temples of that city. He adds, that Assyria had more than one Semiramis: <Q>Parceque ce nom n'étant qu'une ex∣pression generique composée de plusieurs titres de dignité selon le genre et la tournure ordinaire de la langue orientale, il fût commun à plusieurs reines d'Assyrie.—<BIBL><HI>De l'Usage des Statues,</HI> p. 87.</BIBL></Q></P>

pointing to the mansion of the divinity, as if to acknowledge her own past offence in having arrogated to herself the honours due only to Juno. Valerius Maximus has described another, not less remarkable, in which the Assyrian queen was represented with her tresses in a state of disorder, and thus signifying the rapidity with which she is said to have hurried from her toilet to suppress a revolt in Babylon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Semiramis Assyriorum regina, cum ei circa cultum capitis sui occupatae nuntiatum esset Babylonem defecisse, altera parte crinium adhuc soluta, protinus ad eam expugnandam cu∣currit; nec prius decorem capillorum in ordinem, quam tantam urbem in potestatem suam redegit.

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XI. Ver. 270.</HI> And bless'd a bold progenitor in thee.</HEAD>
<P>Daedalus was universally revered by antiquity as the father of Grecian sculpture: but in proportion as his genius became an object of public veneration, his personal history was so involved in the decorations or disguises of fable, that (to the regret of those who love to investigate the lives of meritorious men) it is hardly possible to obtain a satisfactory account of this celebrated sculptor, architect, and mechanist, whose early and successful ingenuity has so justly endeared his name to every lover of art.</P>
<P>The learned Junius has assigned a very copious article to Daedalus, in his catalogue of antient artists; and the Abbé Gedoyn (the respect∣able translator of Quintilian and Pausanias) has introduced a history of Daedalus into the Memoirs of the French Academy. These two elabo∣rate writers have collected all that antiquity could furnish to elucidate his life; but they both seem to admit, as an established fact, one most dishonourable circumstance in the history of their hero, which I am inclined to consider as not more entitled to serious credit than the most fabulous portion of his adventures; I mean, the horrid supposition that he enviously murdered his nephew and his disciple, for possessing inge∣nuity superior to his own.</P>
<P>Of this I shall speak in its place: let me first relate the more early particulars that ancient writers have recorded concerning this celebrated sculptor. He was by birth an Athenian; and though authors differ on the name of his father, they agree in representing him as the grand∣son
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
or great-grandson of Erectheus, the sixth sovereign of Athens; and Pausanias asserts that he lived in the period when Oedipus reigned in Thebes; that is, about half a century before the siege of Troy. Dio∣dorus Siculus, who may be called the earliest biographer of Daedalus that we possess, describes him as having greatly improved the rude sculpture of his age, and excited the admiration of his contemporaries, before the charge of having destroyed his disciple reduced him to the necessity of flying from his country.</P>
<P>In the account that Diodorus has given of this very improbable crime, there is one particular that seems to mark the whole story as a fabulous invention. It is said that this ingenious disciple, the son of his sister, was led to invent a saw by the accident of finding the jaw of a serpent, and by observing the use to which its teeth might be success∣fully applied. It is also said that Daedalus, being surprised and ques∣tioned in the act of burying the murdered youth, answered, that he was consigning a serpent to the earth.</P>
<P>The historian mentions it as a wonder (and it seems one of those specious wonders, which the Greeks were so fond of inventing) that the same animal (the serpent) should prove both the source of a most useful invention, and the means of detecting an execrable crime. The sup∣posed criminal is said to have been condemned by that solemn tribunal the Areopagus: but the mode in which the royal sculptor is imagined to have accomplished the destruction of his disciple is such, that it could hardly admit any legal proof of a murderous intention. Ovid has briefly and forcibly stated the circumstance to which I allude:
<Q><L>Daedalus invidit, sacraque ex arce Minervae</L>
<L>Praecipitem misit, lapsum mentitus.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="209"/>The poet adds, that the falling youth was metamorphosed into a par∣tridge by the pity of Minerva; and I confess that I consider the meta∣morphosis and the murder as equally fabulous.</P>
<P>Every good mind that reflects on the subject will esteem it hardly pos∣sible that a man in an elevated rank of life, and blest himself with a variety of talents, could be induced to murder a promising youth whom he had engaged to instruct, and the child of his own sister, for display∣ing such ingenuity as a master and a relation would be naturally dis∣posed to admire and encourage. A fact of this complexion ought, for the honour of human nature, never to be admitted, except in cases where the evidence that supports it is irresistible.</P>
<P>For the glory of Daedalus we may affirm, that the improbable atro∣city imputed to him is so far from being proved by any testimony, that it rests only on dark tradition; and the whole story has so much the air of a fable, that it ought long ago to have been discountenanced and dis∣carded by every serious biographer of this illustrious artist. Yet writers are so apt to transcribe the wonderful tales of their predecessors without examination, or to credit enormities ascribed to men of talents and dis∣tinction, that this barbarous story has been credulously repeated from age to age. The modern and enlightened authors who have recently discussed the history of Daedalus do not scruple to paint him as an as∣saisin. The Abbé Gedoyn endeavours to varnish his own cruel credu∣lity on this subject by the following remark: <Q>De tout tems une basse jalousie a été le vice des artisans, même de ceux qui font profession des arts les plus nobles; j'en pourrois citer plusieurs exemples en France, comme ailleurs.</Q></P>
<P>An Italian writer of our own time, (Francesco Milisia,) who has pub∣lished an entertaining and successful History of Architects, ancient and modern, speaks of Daedalus in his architectural character, and re∣peats,

in brief but energetic terms, his visionary crime<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Fra' suoi allievi si contraddistinse un suo nipote da alcuni detto calo, da altri attalo, il quale invento tra le altre cose la sega e'l compasso; ma Dedalo ne concepi si nera gelosia, che l'uccise.—<BIBL><HI>Memorie degli Architetti Antichi e Moderni, tomo</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 13. <HI>Parma,</HI> 1781.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. As I am in∣clined to believe that the artists of England may be less acquainted with these feelings of <HI>nera gelosia</HI> (to use the words of the Italian whom I have quoted) than the more impassioned natives of France and Italy, I hope they will approve my endeavour to vindicate from the horrible impu∣tation of an envious murder their ancient brother of Athens. At all events I have a pleasure in persuading myself that he was as clearly in∣nocent as he was confessedly ingenious. When he removed from At∣tica, whatever the cause of that removal might be, he is said to have obtained the friendship of Minos, the second of that name, who reigned in Crete; and to have executed, in wood, two statues of Phae∣dra and Ariadne, the celebrated daughters of the Cretan monarch. In Crete he is reported to have built a labyrinth of marvellous intricacy, and copied, on a smaller scale, from a portentous edifice of Aegypt. He must have studied, therefore, the works of Aegyptian art in their own country, before his visit to Crete. The Cretans were ever re∣markable for their gross deviation from truth; and the narrative of some sculptural works ascribed to Daedalus, in their island, contains the most filthy and disgusting fable that ever sullied the pages of fiction. The reader acquainted with mythology will immediately perceive that I allude to the fable of Pasiphae, the most cruelly calumniated queen that ever suffered from the licentiousness of fancy. Some decent in∣terpreters of her story have supposed that she was enamoured of a Cretan officer who bore the name of Taurus, and that Daedalus was employed in assisting their illicit attachment: but Lucian, with an ad∣mirable mixture of wit and good-nature, imagines the Taurus of Pasi∣phae's
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
affection to have been merely the sign of the zodiac distinguished by that appellation; and Deadalus is very happily metamorphosed, by this supposition, from the culpable confident of a dishonourable intrigue, into an innocent master of astronomy. But however blameless the intercourse might be between the slandered Pasiphae and the inge∣nious Athenian, Daedalus appears to have incurred the resentment of the Cretan monarch, and to have been under the necessity of escaping from his dominion with secret rapidity. Hence arose the fable of his inventing wings for himself and his son Icarus; a fable so captivating to the fancy of the Latin poets, that Ovid has related it twice at con∣siderable length<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Metamorph. lib. viii. Artis Amatoriae, lib.ii.</NOTE>. Virgil has embellished it in a few verses of singular delicacy and pathos. Horace, Silius Italicus, and Ausonius have all mentioned it occasionally. The ancient and sensible interpreter of in∣credible fictions, Palaephatus, has turned the fabulous wings of Daeda∣lus and his son into sails. He asserts, that being imprisoned by Minos, they escaped from a window of their prison, and embarked in a skiff: but being pursued by the vessels of Minos, in tempestuous weather, the father only got safe to land and completed his escape. Apollodorus relates that Hercules found the body of Icarus cast ashore upon an island, to which he gave the name of Icaria, in honour of the youth, whom he buried. The same author adds, that Daedalus rewarded his illustri∣ous friend for this humanity shewn to his unfortunate child, by exe∣cuting a statue of Hercules, which that hero mistaking in the night, for a living figure, is said to have struck with a stone. Pausanias men∣tions this statue as preserved by the Thebans in a temple of Hercules, and gives a similar account of its origin as a tribute of gratitude from the afflicted father, whose escape from Crete he also ascribes, like Pa∣laephatus, to the use of sails. Though Virgil and Silius Italicus repre∣sent Daedalus as building the temple of the Cumaean Apollo, immedi∣ately

after his escape from the tyranny of Minos, the Greek historian of his adventures supposes him to have proceeded from Crete to Sicily, and to have ingratiated himself so successfully with Cocalus, a prince of that country, that when Minos, with a naval force, pursued and de∣manded the fugitive, his generous protector, instead of betraying his ingenious guest, from whose architectural talents he is said to have de∣rived great advantage, endeavoured to negotiate with Minos in his fa∣vour. The Cretan monarch accepted the invitation of the Sicilian prince, and, according to the accounts of more than one ancient Greek author, the daughters of Cocalus contrived, from their partiality to the Athenian artist, to destroy his formidable enemy; which they are said to have accomplished by the means of a hot bath, in such a manner, that the Cretans who attended their king supposed his death to be natural, and departed in peace with his remains—a tale that has much the ap∣pearance of fiction.</P>
<P>Daedalus is reported to have expressed his gratitude towards his Si∣cilian protector by executing many ingenious works in his country. Diodorus relates that he built an impregnable palace for his royal friend; that he fortified and adorned the temple of Venus Erycina; and that he constructed a vapour-bath, in which the sick were plea∣santly cured of their infirmities, without suffering from its heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>DIODORUS SICULUS, lib. 4.</BIBL></Q> <P>A curious proof of the antiquity and excellence of vapour-baths!</P></NOTE>. Concerning the latter days and death of Daedalus antiquity furnishes no anecdotes: but the learned Abbé Gedoyn imagines, with great pro∣bability, that from Italy he passed again into Aegypt, and ended his life in that country—an idea that he rests on the authority of the Aegyptian priests, who reported, according to the narrative of Diodo∣rus Siculus, that Daedalus constructed a most beautiful vestibule to the
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
temple of Vulcan at Memphis, and was held in such veneration by the Aegyptians, that they placed in that temple a statue which he had carved in wood of himself, and raised, in one of the adjacent islands, a temple to the artist, in which his memory was religiously worshipped by the natives of that country.</P>
<P>Thus incomplete are the best accounts that ancient and modern au∣thors afford of this extraordinary and interesting personage, whose ex∣istence, like that of Prometheus and Semiramis, has been questioned by the scrutinizing spirit of modern refinement. A very ingenious and learned French commentator on Pliny, who seems actuated, like Mr. Bryant, by a passion for etymological chemistry, would reduce the active Athenian artist into a mere Syrian symbol<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Daedale est un nom Syrien, dont les racines se retrouvent dans les deux mots Hebreux <HI>dai</HI> (preposition qui de même que <HI>da,</HI> en Grec, augmente le seus du mot qu'elle précede) et <HI>dal,</HI> pauvre.

Of these, the most striking are two statues of himself and his son Icarus; the one formed of tin, the other of brass, and said to have been sta∣tioned in those islands of the Adriatic gulf that were called Elec∣trides<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>STEPHANUS BYZANTINUS, De Ur∣bibus, edit. 1694, p. 379.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="214"/>Aristotle, from whom Stephanus of Byzantium borrowed his account of these questionable statues, has mentioned Daedalus as a maker of puppets that moved by an infusion of quicksilver; an idea that D'Han∣carville has ridiculed with contemptuous pleasantry:</P>
<Q>Sur le temoignage d'un certain Philippe, Aristote, plus de neuf cents ans après Dedale, assuroit qu'au moyen du vif argent, il fit une statue qui marchoit effectivement. Beaucoup d'auteurs, mal∣heureusement très-graves, Dion Chrysostome entr'autres, copierent cette fable, et suivant l'usage l'appuyèrent de leur autorité; je les croirois plus volontiers s'ils eussent écrit que Dedale fit des automates philosophes, capables d'écrire seriusement de tels contes; ils servi∣roient eux-mêmes de justification à ma croyance.</Q>
<P>Pausanias records, with particular care, the more authentic works of Daedalus that remained in his time: his statue of Hercules, at Thebes; of Trophonius, among the Lebadenses in Boeotia: those of Britomar∣tis and of Minerva, in Crete; with the dance of Ariadne, mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, and wrought on white marble; among the Delians, a Venus in wood, with her right hand perishing by Time, and raised on a square basis instead of feet, "I am persuaded," says Pausanias, <Q>that Ariadne received this image from Daedalus, and car∣ried it with her, when she attended Theseus. The Delians affirm that Theseus himself devoted it to their Apollo, that it might not, on his return to his own country, awaken in his mind a painful and passionate recollection of Ariadne. Besides these,</Q> concludes Pau∣sanias, <Q>I know not any works of Daedalus remaining; for as to those which the Argives had consecrated in their temple of Juno, and those removed to Gela in Sicily from Omphace, they have disappeared by the influence of Time.</Q></P>
<P>Pausanias, in a former part of his description, had mentioned ano∣ther statue of Hercules by the same artist, executed also in wood, and
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
placed near a temple of Minerva, in the territory of Corinth. This statue, described as naked, may be therefore considered as the source of the fashion that prevailed in the heroic images of Greece; and Pausa∣nias, in his account of it, delivers his opinion on the works of Daedalus in general. They did not satisfy the sight, (accustomed to the pro∣ductions of improved art,) yet they had in them an air of inspiration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>PAUSANIAS, p. 121.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this candid account, a modern reader may easily conceive the kind of deficiency, and the degree of animation, that were visible in the statues of this early artist. His extraordinary skill as a sculptor seems to rest on his marble bas-relief, representing the Dance of Ari∣adne; I shall therefore close this long, yet imperfect note, on the father of Grecian art, by transcribing the description which Homer has given of his most memorable work, with the lively remarks of D'Han∣carville on this ancient and interesting sculpture.</P>

<Q><P>Cet ouvrage de sculpture, executé près de cinq cents ans après l'in∣vention de la statuaire, decrit environ trois siècles après Dedale par Homere, qui l'avoit assurement vu, puisque Pausanias, plus de mille ans depuis, reconnoit que c'est le même dont il est parlé dans l'Iliade, à laquelle, curieux observateur et savant comme il étoit, il n'avoit sans doubte pas manqué de le comparer; car il l'avoit si bien exa∣miné qu'il specifie même la matière dont il étoit fait; un tel monu∣ment
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
dis-je, détaillé par un homme tel qu' Homère, dont on connoit l'exactitude dans les moindres details où il entre sur les arts, est sans doubte la preuve la plus authentique qui puisse jamais exister des grands progrès faits par la sculpture au moins cent ans avant la prise de Troye, et de l'erreur dans laquelle le peu de critique des anciens, mais sur-tout de Pline, a jetté les modernes au sujet de l'ancienneté des arts.....Ce bas rélief représentant deux tems d'une même action, étoit nécessairement divisé en deux parties, ou par une vase on par une colonne, comme on en a plusieurs exemples dans les monumens an∣tiques. Le premier de ces tableaux représentoit le commencement de la danse, qui se mouvoit en cercle comme pour s'essayer; le Co∣ryphée avec sa compagne entonnoit la chanson qui en étoit le motif, et que le reste des danseurs répétoit. Par les plis et replis de la figure qu'ils formoient, ils marquoient dans le second tableau les tours et les détours du labyrinthe d'ou Thésée sortit au moyen du fil dont Ariane l'avoit pourvu. Dédale, au rapport de Lucien, l'avoit in∣struite de cette danse; et, suivant Homère, il en étoit l'inventeur. C'est le plus ancien ballet figuré dont il foit parlé dans les anciens auteurs; il fût le modèle de tous ceux qui représenterent depuis les actions et les moeurs des hommes: cet art, si l'on en croit Plutarque fût porté si loin qu'il approchoit plus de la poesie, que la peinture même.</P>
<P>Il paroit que les draperies des figures de ce bas-relief colorées sur le bouclier d'Achille, à l'aide des differens métaux qu'on y suppose em∣ployés, l'étoient auffi sur le marbre: dela vient cette expression <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> pour marquer un choeur de diverses couleurs. Nous avons déjà parlé des statues de bois peintes et dorées faites avant Dédale: mais les anciens colorerent aussi et dorérent le marbre, comme on le peut voir par la petite Isis trouvée à Pompeia, par la Diane conservée à Portici, par les cheveux de la belle Vénus de Medicis, et le diademe
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
de l'autre Vénus, conservée avec la première, dans la tribune de la galerie de Florence. Je crois donc que les robes de lin et de laine, que portoient les danseuses et les danseurs de ce bas-relief, étoient peintes, que les ceinturons de ces derniers étoient argentés, et que leurs epées étoient dorées.</P>
<P>Si l'on compare ce que dit Homère de ce monument, avec ce que Pausanias et Platon ont écrit des autres ouvrages de Dédale, on verra que la composition de cette danse ne pouvoit être mieux entendue ni plus riche ou plus agréable qu'elle l'étoit: elle semble avoir donné l'idée des heures, que l'on voit à la vigne Borghèse, et de celles dont le Guide a entouré le char de l'Aurore qu'il a peinte dans le palais Rospigliozi à Rome. Cependant on n'exécute jamais tout ce que l'on concoit, parceque l'habilité de la main, la connoissance des vrais principes de l'art et des moyens qu'il peut employer, ne répondent pas toujours à la grandeur du génie et des idées de celui qui com∣pose: si l'on s'en rapporte au jugement de Pausanias sur le caractère des statues de Dédale; on trouvera que l'exécution de ce bas-relief a dû être inférieure à sa composition; que le style, quoique fort et vi∣goreux en dévoit être austère et privé de grace; si toutefois l'on s'en rapporte à Platon, il foudra croire que les figures employées à rendre ces belles idées, manquoient encore par l'exactitude du dessin, et sans doubte par la justesse des proportions: mais il est assuré que l'on y voyoit les semences de tout ce que la sculpture fit de mieux dans les tems postérieurs. Homère, qui s'il se fût adonné à la sculpture ou à la peinture, eût assurement été aussi habile sculpteur ou peintre qu'il étoit grand poete, nous a dessiné plutôt que décrit ce bas-relief, avec route la vérité et la simplicité qu'eût jamais pu y mettre le plus savant artiste, en le rendant sur le toile ou sur le marbre. On croit le voir en lisant la copie qu'il en a faite; la matière seule en est dé∣truite, mais il nous en a conservé la partie la plus precieuse: ses vers,
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
comme autant de pinceaux donnent à la nature ce coloris et cette fraicheur qui la rendent si aimable. Il faut donc que malgré les reproches faits à Dédale, Homère ait trouvé dans son ouvrage ce gout et ce sentiment, qui seuls sont capables d'echauffer l'imagination, parcequ'ils touchent le coeur, peuvent inspirer des idées riantes à l'esprit par le souvenir des choses agréables qu'ils lui rappellent, et fournir à tous deux les images charmantes dont il a fait usage.</P>

<P>I have transcribed these copious remarks, because they seem to place in a very fair and judicious point of view the merits of the early sculp∣tor, whose obscure history I have wished to illustrate. With such a desire, I have particularly to regret one of the lost comedies ascribed to Aristophanes, which bore the name of Daedalus: yet it is possible that such a composition might not have afforded that clear light concerning the life and character of the artist, which we might eagerly expect from its title. As it was the favourite amusement of Aristophanes to ridicule the tragic poets of his country, perhaps his Daedalus con∣tained little more than a ludicrous parody on the Prometheus of Aeschylus. However this might be, the name of Daedalus appears to have been generally honoured by the poets of Greece; and I hasten to conclude this attempt to elucidate and confirm his reputation with the words of a Greek epigram, that represent him as a paragon of ex∣cellence:

<P>Although the Lacedaemonians were so little attached to the pacific and elegant pursuits of life, that, according to a bold expression of Isocrates concerning them, they were hardly acquainted with their letters, yet they seem to have paid particular regard to the art of sculp∣ture. Pausanias, with his usual accuracy, has recorded that this early and accomplished artist, Gitiadas, whom he celebrates for the variety of his talents, was a native of Sparta<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>PAUSANIAS, p, 250.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.

describer of his sculptural works speaks highly of the figures that he executed in brass, particularly those of Neptune and Amphitrite. That the Lacedemonians had a strong passion for sculpture seems evi∣dent, from the magnificence of their Amyclaean Apollo, whose throne was decorated by Bathycles, an artist of Magnesia, and comprised, as M. de Caylus has justly observed, an epitome of ancient mythology. Winkelman supposes Bathycles to have lived in the age of Solon. One singular advantage which the Spartans expected to derive from the possession of fine statues was to improve the beauty of their offspring; a source of their partiality both to sculpture and to painting which Junius has explained in the following passage: <Q>Lacedaemonii quondam in re∣liquis horridiores, pulcherrimas quasque picturas in summo semper habuerunt pretio; dicuntur enim de liberorum suorum pulchritudine tantopere solliciti fuisse, ut formosissimorum adolescentium Nirei, Nar∣cissi, Hiacinthi, Castoris et Pollucis, deorumque speciosissimorum Apollinis nempe ac Bacchi effigies gravidis uxoribus repraesentarent. <BIBL>JUNIUS, <HI>de Pictura Veterum,</HI> p. 71.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>On the works of Gitiadas, which consisted of brazen bas-reliefs, in the temple of the Spartan Minerva, D'Hancarville has made the fol∣lowing judicious remark:</P>
<Q>La sculpture dans les ouvrages de Gitiadas étoit aussi avancée, que l'étoit la peinture dans ceux d'Helotas, faits peu avant lui, suivant le rapport de Pline: cet art étoit par consequent arrivé en Grèce au point où il parvint en Italie, quand Laurent Ghiberti fit en bronze les admirables bas-reliefs des portes du baptistaire de Florence, et par une singularité remarquable les arts firent dans ces deux pays les mêmes progrés en des tems à-peu-près egaux.</Q>

<P>Dipaenus and Scyllis are usually mentioned together as brothers and associates in their art, which they learnt from Daedalus. Some authors (according to Pausanias) supposed them to be his sons. The most striking part of their history is contained in the following passage of Pliny:</P>
<Q>Marmore scalpendo primi omnium inclaruerunt Dipaenus et Scyllis, geniti in Creta insula, etiamnum Medis imperantibus, priusque quam Cyrus in Persis regnare inciperet: hoc est Olympiade circiter L. Ii Sicyonem se contulere, quae diu fuit officinarum omnium metallorum patria. Deorum quorundam simulacra publice locaverant Sicyonii: quae priusquam absolverentur, artifices injuriam questi abierunt in Aetolos. Protinus Sicyonios infanda invasit sterilitas, moerorque di∣rus.

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XIV. Ver. 316.</HI> And blam'd the mean abuse of mental power.</HEAD>
<P>Anthermus, a sculptor in the island of Chios, had two sons of his own profession, Bupalus and Athenis. The brothers became famous by works of considerable merit in their art; and still more so by their degrading it into an instrument of malevolence against the poet Hippo∣nax. This animated but ill-favoured bard, distinguished by mental ta∣lents and personal deformity, is supposed to have been in love with the daughter of Bupalus, who, to prevent a connexion that he disliked, is said to have exhibited a caricatura of the formidable lover. The exas∣perated poet retaliated by a satire of such severity against the offending sculptors, that, according to tradition, it made them frantic, and im∣pelled them to suicide—a story which, as Pliny justly observes upon it, was sufficiently refuted by their subsequent productions.</P>
<P>Their caricature of Hipponax (perhaps the first caricature upon re∣cord) is supposed by D'Hancarville to have suggested to Thespis, their contemporary, the idea of furnishing his actors with a mask, instead of colouring their faces with vermilion. The satire of the vindictive poet, though we may hope it did not produce the horrible effect ascribed to it, appears to have given celebrity to its indignant author. The Greek Anthologia contains no less than four inscriptions on this powerful sa∣tirist. I have selected the two best of them, for the amusement of my reader:</P>

<P>Hipponax was a native of Ephesus, and he is celebrated by Athenaeus as the inventor of parody: but his title to that invention is in some mea∣sure controverted by the Abbé Sallier, in his Dissertation on the Origin and Character of Parody, in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Bayle has an article on Hipponax, in which he has collected many curious examples of persons who have suffered from the dangerous se∣verity of literary vengeance. The enmity between the sculptor of Chios and the Ephesian satirist will probably recall to the recollection of
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
an English reader the similar enmity between those bitter and powerful antagonists, Hogarth and Churchill.</P>
<P>From the slight fragments that remain of Hipponax, I am inclined to believe that his Satires, celebrated as they have been, were inferior in genius, and perhaps in acrimony, to the vindictive performance of the English poet, which contains so many beautiful passages, (beautiful both in sentiment and expression,) that although good-nature must wish the quarrel which produced it had never existed, the poem is still admi∣rable as a masterpiece of poetical indignation.</P>

<P>The passion of the Greeks for liberty was at once proclaimed and nourished by the various honours which they paid to the memory of Harmodius and Aristogiton.</P>
<P>These celebrated young friends had perished in their perilous exploit of delivering Athens from the tyranny of Hipparchus: but the grate∣ful Athenians revered them as the restorers of freedom; and according to the animated expressions of Demosthenes in their praise, the venera∣tion which they received from public gratitude was equal to that of he∣roes and of gods. The four statuaries, Antenor, Critias, Antigonus, and Praxiteles, had distinguished themselves, at different periods, in executing the statues of these favourite public characters. Pliny relates that this work of Praxiteles was carried off by Xerxes, in the plunder of Athens, and restored to that city by Alexander the Great, after his conquest of Persia. Arrian appears so much pleased with this munificence of his
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
hero to Athens, that he has mentioned the restitution of these interest∣ing statues in two different passages of his History; and exultingly says, in his account of them, "they are now in the Ceramicus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—<BIBL>ARRIAN, de Expedit. Alexandri. lib. iii.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>!" Pausa∣nias asserts that the statues were restored to Athens by Antiochus; and Valerius Maximus ascribes the honour of their restitution to Seleucus. These contradictory accounts may be reconciled, if we recollect that many statues were executed of these idolized martyrs to freedom; and as it is probable that several of these were carried out of their coun∣try by the Persian plunderers, the honour of their restitution might of course be truly ascribed to more than one victorious friend to the arts and monuments of Greece. Sculpture and Poetry seem to have vied with each other in their endeavours to immortalize these young ty∣rannicides. The Athenian song of Harmodius is proverbially fa∣mous; and its potent enthusiasm is thus forcibly described by our learned and eloquent Lowth, in his admirable Praelectiones:</P>

<P>Among the infinite number of interesting personal anecdotes which the history of ancient sculpture displays, there are hardly any more pleasing to the fancy, or more calculated to exhibit the Grecian character in a favourable point of view, than the anecdotes preserved by Pausanias, concerning the Athenian women and their children, who having found a friendly refuge in the walls of Traezene, when the Persian invasion reduced them to the necessity of flying from their native city, had their statues erected in a portico of the Traeze∣nian Forum. I presume that these statues were a present from the people of Athens. They were such memorials as every patriot of Greece must have contemplated with peculiar delight: they were graceful monuments of Grecian courage, benevolence, and gratitude,

<P>I follow the authority of Cicero, Vitruvius, and Quintilian in nam∣ing Myron as the earliest of the more accomplished Grecian sculptors, who acquired infinite celebrity by making near approaches to perfection in their art. Pausanias speaks of Myron as an Athenian: but Pliny affirms that he was born at Eleutherae, (a city of Baeotia,) and a dis∣ciple of Agelades, an artist of Argos. The Bacchus of Myron is said by Pausanias to have excelled all his other productions, except his statue of Erectheus at Athens: but this very diligent artist appears to have ex∣ecuted many works of considerable excellence, and to have been most commended for what he probably regarded as a trifling performance. I allude to his famous heifer of brass, celebrated by no less than thirty-six epigrams in the Greek Anthologia; upon which the French sculptor
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
Falconet says, with some pleasantry and some justice, <Q>Les Atheniens étoient les François de la Grèce, et devoient faire autant de jolis vers sur un vache que nous en avons faits sur la chatte en sculpture de Madame de Lesdiguières<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Traduction des 34, 35, et 36 Livres de Pline, avec des Notes par Etienne Falconet, tom. i. p. 85.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I ought, however, to observe, for the credit of Athens, that these epigrams are far from having been all produced by her citizens. They form, altogether, such a heap of insipid compliments as would not, I think, have appeared very flattering to an artist of Attic genius. The following, I believe, is one of the best of them:</P>

This remark cannot be ex∣tended to Pliny, who has described the works of Myron as rather defi∣cient in expression; an opinion which Falconet pronounces to be an egregious mistake, if the antique head of Jupiter, that was stationed in the garden of Versailles, and ascribed to Myron, is in truth a perform∣ance of this celebrated artist. Though I am generally disposed to take the part of Pliny against the pert malevolence with which the lively and keen Falconet has attacked and derided his opinions, I must confess that I think the respectable connoisseur of ancient Rome mistaken in the present point; and his mistake appears sufficiently proved by the fol∣lowing animated Greek verses on the Ladas of Myron, a statue which, if the poet who describes it may be trusted, was surely a masterpiece of <HI>expression:</HI></P>

<P>As to the general merit of Polycletus, the words of the intelligent Strabo give a very high idea of it, where he says that the statues of this artist were in technical excellence most beautiful; but, in high finishing and magnificence, inferior to those of Phidias<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>STRABO, p. 571.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cicero has also mentioned the works of Polycletus as examples of perfection: <Q>Nondum Myronis satis ad veritatem adducta, jam tamen quae non dubites pulchra dicere. Pulchriora etiam Polycleti, et jam plane perfecta, ut mihi quidem videri solet.</Q></P>
<P>In his orations against Verres, the Roman orator expatiates on the extreme beauty of two bronze figures, the celebrated Canephorae of Polycletus; and Winkelman, in his Monumenti inediti, (No. 182.) has engraved, from a bas-relief in terra-cotta, two Athenian virgins that he supposes to have been copied from these favourite statues.</P>
<P>But the most considerable performance of Polycletus was his Juno of Argos, or rather of Mycenae, according to the local description which Strabo has given of her temple. This admired statue is described by

<P>The reputation of Polycletus seems to have been much extended by a Treatise on Proportion, illustrated by a statue, regarded as a model of perfect symmetry, and said to have been studied as such, in a later period, by Lysippus. Many writers have mentioned this remarkable
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
statue, but the most satisfactory account of it is contained in a passage of Galen, quoted by Junius, which expressly says that it was designed to confirm those principles of art which the sculptor taught in writing upon symmetry; and that both his treatise and his statue were distin∣guished by a common name, "The canon of Polycletus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>GALENUS apud Junium, in Catalogo Artificum, p. 168.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>." D'Han∣carville, in the following passage, points out a mode of recovering the lost theory of the Grecian artist:</P>
<Q>Ces Commentaires de Polyclete, malheureusement perdus aujourd∣hui, ayant été regardés autrefois comme la regle constamment suivie depuis son tems jusqu'à celui des Antonins, Menechme, Xenocrates, Apelles, qui vécurent dans cet intervalle, ayant composé différens ouvrages sur les raisons de l'art, on ne peut douter qu'il n'aient con∣tenu les principes de Polyclete sur les symmétries, et nous les y retrouverions si le tems n'eût pas détruit ces écrits. Mais comme à son imitation les plus habiles artistes de l'antiquité firent leurs statues d'après les regles établies dans ses livres nous pouvons retrouver dans les plus belles statues antiques les proportions qu'il enseignoit devoir y entrer, et juger, d'après ces proportions, sur quoi se fondoit la thé∣orie des principes renfermés dans les ouvrages des anciens sur les <HI>sym∣metries</HI> et la <HI>beauté idèale.</HI></Q>
<P>The author pursues his idea in discussing proportions relating to the face, collected by Mengs, and cited by Winkelman, from the finest specimens of ancient sculpture. Into the minutiae of such a discussion the intent of this work does not lead me to enter. He draws an in∣ference from these researches which I confess myself unwilling to allow; for he says:</P>
<Q><PB N="233" REF="239"/>Quand les anciens arrivèrent à la decouverte des proportions con∣venables à la <HI>beauté ideale,</HI> leur analogie avec les proportions <HI>har∣moniques</HI> servit à prouver qu'ils avoient incontestablement atteint au but de l'art, et l'impossibilité de trouver une beauté supérieure à celle qui résulta de ses proportions, elle nous sert maintenant à demontrer que l'art des Grecs ne peut eh aucun tems, ni en aucun lieu, ni par aucun moyen, être surpassé<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Antiquités Etrusques, Grecques, et Romaines, tom. iv. p. 137.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P>With an enthusiastic esteem and admiration for the excellence of the Greeks in art and in literature, the moderns ought to cherish a per∣suasion that even that excellence, great as it is, may possibly be sur∣passed. Such an idea may be censured as presumptuous: but in every arduous pursuit a degree of presumption is the very source of success. Reason and fancy may unite in refusing to believe that, in cultivating the fine arts, any nation, or any individual has yet arrived at the utmost limits of attainable perfection. In sculpture, indeed, it is not very probable that any modern artist, in any part of the globe, may possess all the advantages to lead him to excellence which the sculptors of an∣tiquity possessed; yet the modern may avail himself of some advan∣tages to which the ancient was a stranger. But I forbear to enter on a topic which may be more properly discussed when modern art is the im∣mediate subject before us.—I return to Polycletus.</P>
<P>Winkelman has styled him a sublime poet in his art; and he seems, indeed, to have enjoyed that rare mixture of industry, confidence, and imagination which is so favourable to felicity in the works of his pro∣fession.</P>
<P>Aelian has related the following anecdote, to shew how successfully he corrected the temerity of popular criticism:</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240"/>Polycletus executed two statues at the same time; gratifying, in the one, the caprice of the crowd; in the other, adhering to the rules of art. He gratified the multitude in this manner: According to the sug∣gestion of all his visitors, he retouched and altered something in con∣formity to the opinion of each. At last he produced his two figures; the one was universally admired; the other derided. "Yet this," said Polycletus, "which you condemn, is your own work; and the other, which you admire, is mine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <BIBL>AELIAN.

<P>It is recorded of this excellent sculptor, that he excelled also as an architect; and Pausanias extols the temple of Aesculapius, which he built for the Epidaurians, as surpassing, in harmonious beauty, all the magnificent structures of the Romans.

<P>The talents and reputation of Phidias were so great, that they are allowed to form the most honourable aera in the history of art. The Abbé Gedoyn has added to his history of Daedalus an account of this his most illustrious successor, for the sake of displaying at once, in the lives of these two memorable men, the commencement and the per∣fection of sculpture.

He studied under two masters of no great celebrity, Agelas and Hippias: but he had the advantage of having two brothers distinguish∣ed by their talents as painters, and the still greater advantage of having cultivated and brought to maturity his own genius, at that fortunate period when the triumphant state of his country, and the magnificent spirit of Pericles, afforded him a most favourable field for its exertion. With what patriotic pride and delight must an Attic sculptor have ex∣erted his powers in converting that very marble, which the Persian in∣vaders had brought with them to form a trophy of their conquest, into a memorial of their defeat! I allude to the Nemesis of Phidias, a statue executed under these animating circumstances, according to Pausanias, and stationed in a temple at Rhamnus, at the distance of sixty stadia from Marathon—a statue, celebrated in the following epigram:</P>

<P>Phidias is said to have distinguished himself by his general knowledge, and a perfect acquaintance with the laws of proportion, and the princi∣ples of optics.</P>
<P>That singular metrical compiler of anecdotes, Tzetzes, has related, in his <HI>Versus Politici,</HI> a professional contest between Phidias and Alca∣menes, in which (if credit may be given to such an historian) this ad∣mired

<P>The rival artists contended in forming a Minerva of bronze for the city. The most beautiful figure was to be chosen, and stationed on a lofty column. The two statues were produced. That of Alcamenes was immediately admired for its delicacy; and the work of Phidias ap∣peared so disgusting to the people, from its open lips and distended nostrils, that its author was in some danger of being stoned to death by popular indignation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,</L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L><BIBL>TZETZES, chil. 8.193.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>: but when the rival goddesses were raised to their intended height, Alcamenes became the jest, and Phidias the fa∣vourite of the people.</P>
<P>Such is the amusing story of Tzetzes. What degree of serious credit it may deserve I leave to the judgment of my reader, and hasten to no∣tice the two most celebrated works of Phidias; his more magnificent Minerva, stationed as the patroness of Athens in her temple called Parthenon; and the statue extolled as the masterpiece of antiquity, his Olympian Jupiter at Elis.</P>
<P>Pausanias describes this Minerva as an upright figure, with a garment descending to her feet. He does not mention her height; but M. de Caylus, from the expression of Pliny, (cubitorum viginti sex,) estimates it at thirty-nine feet, of the French measure. <Q>The costly splendor of the statue,</Q> says Winkelman, <Q>may be conceived from the quan∣tity of gold employed in its decoration. This, as we learn from a
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
speech of Pericles preserved in Thucydides, amounted to forty ta∣lents; the drapery was of gold, and the uncovered parts of the figure formed of ivory.</Q> The latter material was also employed in the head of Medusa that appeared on the breast of the goddess, according to the description of Pausanias; and perhaps gold and ivory were united in the image of Victory of four cubits, that was placed in one of her hands; though its position is not ascertained by Pausanias, who only says that in her hand she held a spear. But the smaller figure of Vic∣tory that was frequently added as a decoration to a colossal statue, and displayed in the extended hand of the triumphant divinity, was some∣times of solid gold, as we may conjecture from the profane jest of Dio∣nysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, who, in stealing such figures, said it would be folly not to take from the gods what they appeared to offer.— But to return to the Minerva of Phidias. Pliny says that on the promi∣nent side of her shield the battle of the Amazons was represented; and in the concave part, the conflict between the giants and the gods. Nay, even her sandals were decorated, according to his account, with the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithae.</P>
<P>M. de Caylus has ventured to criticise, with a becoming spirit, these minute decorations:</P>
<Q><P>Après avoir remercié Pline de nous avoir conservé ces details, qui ne se trouvent dans aucun autre auteur, on' me trouvëra sans doute hardi, et peut-être temeraire, d'oser desapprouver ces petits ouvrages en eux-mêmes.

Mais quoique le bouclier pût avoir dix pieds de diametre, on ne pouvoit examiner ses ornemens assez
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
près, en quelque endroit qu'il ait été placé pour en juger sainement sur une figure d'environ quarante pieds de proportion, d'autant qu'elle étoit placée sur un piédestal qui l'élevoit encore tout au moins de dix ou de quinze. Cette figure, pour être aussi belle que toute l'antiquité l'a declarée, devoit être entendue et formée par de grandes masses, et ces masses devoient nécessairement absorber un aussi grand nombre de petits details. Il faut convenir que les anciens paroissent les avoir aimés .... Cependant pour faire mieux entendre mon espèce de critique, je comparerai ces petits travaux à ceux d'un peintre, qui faisant le portrait d'une femme aussi grand que la nature, auroit grand soin de peindre en miniature un autre portrait qu'elle auroit au bras. Je demande si le travail et la disposition du grand portrait ne feroient pas absolument évanouir le mérite et l'ouvrage du brasselet. Cepen∣dant il s'en faut beaucoup que la comparison soit en proportion avec le point duquel je suis parti.</P>

<P>The sculptor Falconet, who attacks, without mercy, the inaccu∣racies of Pliny, and is sometimes rather petulantly severe on the re∣spectable connoisseur of his own country whom I have just quoted, yet highly commends these remarks on the Minerva of Phidias. At the same time he makes a lively, but a rash attempt, to vindicate the Athe∣nian artist in the following conjecture:</P>
<Q><P>Mais si Phidias n'a point fait ces petits ornemens; s'ils n'ont été ajoutés à sa Minerve d'or et d'yvoire que plusieurs années après la mort de l'auteur, que deviendra l'exactitude de Pline et de ceux qui le copient sans regarder ailleurs?</P>

Cette statue est si haute, que l'aigrette du casque et la pointe de la pique peuvent étre aperçues de Sunium.' C'est-à-dire de cinque lieues d'Athènes.</P>
<P>Le minutieux Pausanias, qui ne fait grace de rien à son lecteur, parle ailleurs de la Minerve du Parthénon, qui étoit, comme on fait, dans la citadelle d'Athènes, et ne dit pas un mot de toute cette cise∣lure, gravure, &amp;c. dont Pline fait mention; details qu'il ne manque cependant jamais d'écrire, quand il en a l'occasion. Ne se pourroit-il pas que les deux Minerves de Phidias eussent été confondües dans la tête de l'ecrivain Latin, et qu'il eut attribué à l'une ce qui apartenoit à l'autre?

<P>This animated artist, who is often very acrimonious in censuring the inaccuracy of respectable writers on subjects relating to his own pro∣fession, has fallen himself into considerable inaccuracies, in speaking of this celebrated Minerva. I shall not enter into a minute discussion of these, but merely observe, that his conjecture concerning the figures on
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
the shield of the goddess is entirely overthrown by many passages from ancient authors collected by Junius to illustrate this statue.</P>
<P>It was alleged as a crime against Phidias that he had introduced his own portrait and that of Pericles in the battle of the Amazons, which formed the most striking ornament of the shield in question; and Ju∣nius has cited a passage from Aristotle particularly remarkable, as it dis∣plays the ingenious solicitude of the sculptor to preserve his own figure from the malignity of any one who might wish to strike it out of the group<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <Q>Phidiam illum, quem fictorem pro∣bum fuisse tradit memoria, vidi ipse in clypeo Minervae, quae arcibus Atheniensibus praesi∣det, oris sui similitudinem ita colligasse, ut si quis artificis voluisset inde imaginem separare, soluta compage, simulac totius incolumitas interiret.—Sic Apulcius transtulit hunc locum de∣sumtum ex Aristotele de Mundo.—<BIBL>JUNIUS, Catal.

<P>Plutarch considers the base attempt to ruin Phidias in the esteem of the Athenians as a political manoeuvre to try the public influence of his patron Pericles. We owe to that invaluable biographer the anec∣dote to which I have alluded in the Poem: I mean the friendly pre∣caution of Pericles, by which he protected the sculptor from the slan∣derous accusation of having embezzled a part of the gold consigned to him for the decoration of Minerva. By the advice of his illustrious friend, the artist is said to have contrived the golden habiliments of the goddess in such a manner that they might be easily removed, and his probity ascertained by the infallible test of the scales.</P>
<P>The vindication of his innocence in this important article did not secure Phidias from the insidious rancour of his enemies. He was ac∣cused of alluring the chaste matrons of Athens to his house, under the pretence of shewing his statues, for the dishonourable purpose of grati∣fying the licentious passions of his patron. It has been said that he
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
perised in prison, under the popular indignation which this calumny excited: but the indefatigable Meursius has proved, by the authority of an old scholiast on Aristophanes, that the persecuted artist escaped to Elis, and ended his days with honour in a scene which he is supposed to have adorned, in gratitude for the protection it afforded him, with the sublimest work of sculpture that was ever produced, even by Grecian talents—his Olympian Jupiter; an image which he conceived, accord∣ing to his own ingenuous account, from Homer's description of the god<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Phidias Homeri versibus egregio dicto allusit; simulacro enim Jovis Olympii perfecto, quo nullum praestantius aut admirabilius humanae fabricae manus fecit, interrogatus ab amico, quonam mentem suam dirigens vultum Jovis propemodum ex ipso coelo petitum, eboris lineamentis esset amplexus, illis se versibus quasi magistris usum respondit: <Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</L></Q> <BIBL>VALERIUS MAXIMUS, l. iii. c. 7.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>

Falconet supposes that the temple and the statue were wretchedly disproportioned to each other:

but the general voice of antiquity, in praise of the very sublime effect which this spectacle altogether produced, is sufficient to refute his sup∣position.

<P>How deplorable was the fate of Athens, repeatedly the captive of two, the most artful, sanguinary, and impious wretches that dishonoured the list of ancient heroes—Lysander and Sylla! Both these barbarous conquerors had a passion for sculpture; so great was the influence of that powerful art over the sternest spirits of antiquity! Plutarch informs us, that after Lysander had taken Athens, he devoted a part of his spoil to the expence of raising his own statue, and those of his officers, at Delphi. Yet so truly savage was this detestable victor, that Plutarch rather seems to believe the report he mentions of Lysander's having proposed, in the council of the allies, to reduce the Athenians to slavery. A Theban officer, according to the same authority, proposed the utter demolition of the city; and Athens is said to have been saved by the happy voice of a Phocensian, who sung to the conquerors, at a banquet, a few verses from a tragedy of Euripides, which awakened their humanity, and made them shrink from their horrible purpose of annihilating a city so admirable, and the parent of men so illustrious.</P>

<P>Sculpture is assuredly one of the most difficult of the fine arts; yet it is a striking truth that Greece produced several sculptors of the first rate, though she could only boast a single Homer. It is also remark∣able, that the Grecian sculptors were more numerous than the painters of their country. That intelligent and contemplative observer of an∣tiquity, M. de Caylus, has had the curiosity to compare their respective numbers, as far as the narratives of Pausanias and Pliny enabled him to make the comparison. Of the former he says: <Q>Il ne fait mention que de quinze peintres, tandis qu'il distingue de la manière la plus claire cent soixante et neuf sculpteurs. Il faut cependant convenir que Pline fait mention de cent trente-trois peintres Grecs, bons ou médi∣ocres..... On pourroic repondre pour concilier les deux auteurs, que Pline a parlé de tous les peintres de la Grèce, de l'Asie Mineure, de la Sicile, et de ce que l'on appelloit la grande Grèce, &amp;c. et que Pausanias n'a pas même visité toute la Grèce proprement dite, qu'il n'écrivoit point l'histoire des artistes, et qu'il parloit seulement de ceux dont il avoit vû les ouvrages; ouvrages dont le nombre étoit encore diminué, par l'avidité des Romains, qui dévastoient ce pays depuis environs quatre-vingt ans; à compter le tems qui s'étoit écoulé depuis Pline jusqu'à lui.</Q></P>

<P>Of all the arts in which they excelled, sculpture seems, indeed, to have been the prime favourite of the Greeks; and to the national en∣thusiasm

in its favour the Grecian statues are principally indebted for their exquisite perfection.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Ver. 206.</BIBL> Records her sorrow, and preserves her fame.</Q>
<P>Scopas, a native of Paros, is mentioned by Pliny as a contemporary with Myron and Polycletus, in the 87th Olympiad. He is represented also, by the same author, and by Vitruvius, as one of the eminent artists employed by the magnificent Artemisia in decorating the monu∣ment of her husband Mausolus.</P>
<P>But as a sculptor, who lived so early, could hardly have been living at the time when that sumptuous monument was raised, Winkelman conjectures that more than one artist was distinguished by the name of Scopas. It seems rather more probable that Pliny was mistaken in the period he assigned to this admirable sculptor; and indeed the chronology of almost all the ancient artists, and their most memorable works, is so full of perplexities and contradiction, that mistakes of this kind are almost unavoidable in a cursory view of their productions.</P>
<P>The works of Scopas seem to have been full of fancy and feeling; yet it is not easy to form an exact idea of his three statues, representing the variations of Love, as they are briefly described by Pausanias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The commentator on Pausanias, to elucidate these three Greek titles of Cupid, refers his reader to the Grecian Phurnutus "De Natura Deorum:" but on consulting Phurnutus, I find no light, but rather the "darkness visible" of ridiculous etymologies.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>M. de Caylus imagines that these Nereids, riding on their sea-horses, were executed in bas-relief. Falconet is of a different opinion. It is, however, probable that they were so, and that they are still preserved.</P>
<P>I have seen admirable sketches of such Nereids as answer to Pliny's description, executed at Rome by Mr. Howard, an English artist, who has the rare talent of drawing from sculpture with such precision and delicacy, that England may soon surpass other countries in a just and graceful representation of those ancient statues which her men of for∣tune and taste have collected; especially as the Dilettanti Society have judiciously confided to this artist the conduct of such a work, peculiarly calculated to display his abilities, and to reflect an honour on their own institution. It is much to be lamented, that almost all the prints, de∣signed to illustrate the many voluminous and costly books upon sculpture, are rather caricatures of ancient art, than a faithful copy of its per∣fections.</P>
<P>But to return to the ancient artist whose works are the immediate sub∣ject of this note.—Pliny has very highly praised a Venus by Scopas, and is supposed to have said that it excelled the Gnidian Venus of Praxiteles, which he had just celebrated as the most beautiful statue to be found on earth. Falconet, with his usual petulance, derides Pliny for so gross a contradiction; and even his liberal friend and admirer, M. de Caylus, laments this striking inconsistency. Let me hazard
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
what appears to me a probable conjecture, to save the credit of an author to whom the lovers of art have infinite obligation. I am per∣suaded that all the blame which Pliny has incurred for this supposed contradiction arose solely from a slip of the pen in the original manu∣script: but to elucidate the point, I must transcribe the passage as it stands, and add the new reading I wish to introduce: <Q>Praeterea Ve∣nus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidiam antecedens, et quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</Q>—According to the present reading, there is not only a contradiction of what he had just asserted concerning the pre-eminence of the Gnidian statue, but the latter part of the sentence has little or no meaning. By the following slight change in the orthography the absurd contradiction will be utterly re∣moved, and a significant spirit will appear in the close of the sentence: <Q>Praeterea Venus in eodem loco nuda Praxitelicam illam Gnidi <HI>non</HI> antecedens, <HI>at</HI> quemcunque alium locum nobilitatura.</Q>—<Q>A naked Venus, not surpassing, indeed, that of Praxiteles at Gnidos, but such as would ennoble any other place.</Q></P>
<P>Pliny mentions it as a doubt, in his age, whether the Niobe at Rome is the work of Praxiteles or of Scopas. M. de Caylus makes a pleasant remark on the modesty of the Roman author, and recommends it as a lesson to modern connoisseurs:</P>
<Q>On doit lui savoir gré de l'aveu de son ignorance sur le nom des auteurs des ouvrages, qui decoroient la ville de Rome. Il donne en ce cas une leçon à tous les curieux presens et à venir, dont la décision est pour l'ordinaire imperieuse et sans appel.—<BIBL><HI>Mem. de l'Academie,</HI> tom. xxv. p. 322.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Among the impassioned works of Scopas, his Bacchanal was parti∣cularly admired. Junius, in his account of this artist, has inserted two Greek epigrams from the Anthologia, in praise of the figure to which I allude: but there is a third epigram, by Paulus Silentiarius,
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
(one of the best among the late writers in that motley collection!) which was probably composed on the same statue, and which I prefer to the two epigrams cited by Junius. It runs thus:

<Q><L>This Bacchanal grew wild by art alone,</L>
<L>Art, that infus'd delirium in the stone!</L></Q></P>
<P>There is a very pompous eulogy on the Bacchanal of Scopas in that singular little work, Descriptions of Fourteen Ancient Statues, in Greek prose, by Callistratus. It is surprising that two such scholars as Meur∣sius and Olearius could suppose these descriptions to be written by the very Callistratus whom Demosthenes attended, with delight, as his master in eloquence. They rather seem the production of some trifling and declamatory sophist, of a much later period. The description of the Bacchanal closes, however, with a high compliment to the genius of Scopas; as it asserts that his sculpture displayed that sort of energy and spirit which characterised the orations of Demosthenes. Olearius, who published Callistratus in his excellent edition of the two Philostrati, supposes this comparison of the sculptor with the orator to have been added to the original description by some later hand. As it is peculi∣arly

<P>This eminent artist, like his predecessor Phidias, and many of the Greeks, was doubly distinguished as an architect and a sculptor. Per∣haps he was employed in both capacities on the magnificent tomb of Mausolus, a work celebrated by many writers of antiquity as one of the seven wonders of the world, and ingeniously illustrated by M. de Caylus, in a dissertation on its form and dimensions, which the curious reader may find in the Memoirs of the French Academy. Five artists of distinction were engaged in this stupendous structure, which rose to the height of an hundred and forty feet, including what crowned the summit—a triumphal chariot of marble! The columns that surrounded the lower part of the fabric amounted to thirty-six, comprising its four fronts. Those to the south and north were more extensive than the other two. The eastern aspect was assigned to the conduct of Scopas. The monument is doubly remarkable as a work of magnificent expense and of genuine affection. The fair sovereign of Caria was so sincere a mourner, that she is said to have died literally of grief for the lost Mausolus before his sumptuous monument could be completed. She had, however, sufficient energy of character to act as a heroine after his de∣cease; and Vitruvius records an anecdote of her prowess which I am induced to mention, as it shews, in a very forcible light, the veneration paid by the ancients to the statues erected under the auspices of Victory.</P>
<P>The Rhodians, who were subject to Mausolus, rebelled against his widow Artemisia. The indignant queen, by a very bold stratagem, took possession of their city, and raised in it, as a trophy of her con∣quest,
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
two statues of brass; her own figure, and another representing Rhodes submitting to her authority. "The Rhodians," says Vitruvius, <Q>were prevented, by their religion, from removing those statues: but they built around them, to conceal from the view of the public me∣morials of their disgrace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Tunc Arthemisia Rhodo capta, principibus occisis, trophaeum in urbe Rhodo suae vic∣toriae constituit, Aeneasque duas statuas fecit, unam Rhodiorum civitatis, alteram suae imaginis et istam figuravit Rhodiorum civitati stigmata imponentem.

<P>Praxiteles, who is mentioned by Pliny as flourishing with his brother artist Euphranor, in the 104th Olympiad, arose to the highest distinction for the impassioned delicacy of his works, both in brass and marble, but particularly in marble. The rank he held in the public esteem is evi∣dent from the petty anecdote recorded in Phaedrus, that those who had delicate pieces of sculpture to sell, enhanced the price of them by erasing

Pliny, who has enumerated many productions of Praxiteles, celebrates his Gnidian Venus as the most perfect image of beauty that sculpture ever produced; and relates some amusing incidents in proof of its per∣fection, particularly an offer made to the inhabitants of Gnidos, by the king Nicomedes, who was desirous of purchasing this admired statue on the liberal terms of paying the heavy public debt of their island. They chose rather to struggle with any difficulties than to relinquish a work of art with which Praxiteles had ennobled their country. The statue was stationed in a small open temple, that the form of the goddess might be visible in every direction; and it was esteemed ad∣mirable in every point of view <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>Praxitelis aetatem inter statuarios diximus, qui marmoris gloria superavit etiam semet.

<P>The glory that Praxiteles acquired from the excellence of his Venus was increased by the felicity with which he executed more than one statue of Cupid. The orations of Cicero against Verres have given ce∣lebrity to the marble Cupid, which the orator represents as a rival to one still more famous, by the same artist, that formed the pride and the wealth of the Thespians—a statue spared by Mummius, when he plun∣dered the cities of Greece. The rapacious Verres had robbed an in∣genious and friendly Sicilian of a similar exquisite and invaluable work of art, which Cicero describes as the production of Praxiteles. It is remarkable that the Roman orator speaks with singular modesty, on this occasion, of his own knowledge as a connoisseur: <Q>Marmoreum Praxitelis, (nimirum didici etiam, dum in istum inquiro, artificum nomina.</Q>) The rapacity of the infamous governor had indeed amassed such a collection of sculpture, that an examination of his plunder was almost sufficient to form a Roman connoisseur. The curious reader may find this collection agreeably illustrated in a Dissertation by the Abbé Fraguier, inserted in the Memoires of the French Academy, and intitled "The Gallery of Verres."</P>
<P>The happiest of Cicero's repartees alluded to a statue of this collection, a very valuable sphinx of bronze, which formed a part of the power∣ful
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
extortioner's Sicilian plunder. Verres had bestowed it, as a retain∣ing fee, on his advocate, the celebrated orator Hortensius, who had a strong passion for works of art. In the course of the pleadings, Hor∣tensius happened to say to his antagonist, <Q>I do not understand these riddles!</Q>—"But you ought," replied Cicero; <Q>for you have the sphinx at home<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Both Pliny and Quintilian have recorded this bon mot. The latter cites it as a model of oratorical urbanity: <Q>Ex historia etiam ducere urbanitatem, eruditum: ut Cicero fecit, cum ei testem in judicio verris roganti dixisset Hortensius: 'Non intelligo haec aenigmata.'

<P>To return to the Cupid of Praxiteles.—The sculptor Falconet has cen∣sured his countryman, M. de Jaucourt, for inserting in the French En∣cyclopedia an anecdote relating to this celebrated statue, told on the au∣thority of the president de Thou. The story says that the March∣ioness of Mantua possessed, in the year 1573, the Cupid of Praxiteles, and the sleeping Cupid of Michael Angelo; and that de Thou, with other guests of the Marchioness, were charmed with the work of the modern artist, till they compared it with a superior work of antiquity that seemed to annihilate its merit. The story is certainly improbable in many points of view; and Falconet exults in producing what he considers as a proof that the fact was impossible: I mean, the testimony of Pausanias, declaring that the famous Cupid of Praxiteles, a statue of marble, and the idol of the Thespians, perished (after a variety of ad∣ventures) in a fire at Rome. The evidence of Pausanias sufficiently proves, indeed, the fate of the Thespian statue, but it does not amount to a proof that it was impossible for the Marchioness of Mantua to possess a Cupid executed by Praxiteles; because we have already seen that there existed two marble Cupids of acknowledged beauty, by this illustrious sculptor; and among the statues described by Callistratus, two Cupids, by the same artist, in bronze, are celebrated as works of ex∣quisite
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
perfection. On one of these, perhaps, the following epigram was written; though Junius imagined that it was composed on the Thespian Cupid, and that the poet had taken the liberty to turn the marble into brass:</P>

<P>This highly-admired sculptor had the happiness of training his son Cephissodorus to considerable excellence in his own profession. That pleasing and accurate writer, the Abbé Guasco, has fallen, I think, into a little mistake concerning this son of Praxiteles, whom he represents as pursuing the art of his father, without inheriting his talents. The words of Pliny, who mentions several statues executed by this eminent son, of a father still more eminent, may rather lead us to think that the genius as well as the property of his parent descended to the filial artist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Praxitelis filius Cephissodorus rei et artis haeres suit.

Propertius has simply and happily expressed his peculiar merit and his great celebrity in a single verse:
<Q>Gloria Lysippo est animosa effingere signa.</Q></P>
<P>His works were particularly admired for truth and energy of charac∣ter; and the period in which he flourished (the 114th Olympiad) afforded him a most favourable field for the utmost exertion of his ta∣lents. The number of his works is a noble proof of his indefatigable

application. They amounted to six hundred and ten, according to the most moderate of the two accounts that different copies of Pliny ex∣hibit. Even this number has rather a marvellous sound: but the fol∣lowing intelligent remarks of M. de Caylus, on this subject, are suffi∣cient to satisfy readers, not familiar with the process of this admirable art, that the multitude of bronzes ascribed to Lysippus is far from ex∣ceeding the limits of credibility; though Pliny has mentioned them in such terms as might produce, without the explanation of experience, only incredulous astonishment.</P>
<Q><P>Le nombre des ouvrages des fondeurs en particulier, selon Pline, est inconcevable. On assure que le seul Lysippe en fit six cens dix morceaux, qui tous auroient rendu célèbre celui qui n'en auroit fait qu'un-seul. Il fût aisé de savoir leur nombre, car il avoit coûtume de mettre à part un denier d'or quand il en avoit produit un nouveau, et son heritier en fit le calcul après sa mort.</P>
<P>Pline ne pouvoit rien dire de plus fort que d'ajoûter, sur le detail de ces morceaux, 'Tantae omnia artis, ut claritatem possent dare vel singula.'</P>
<P>C'est presenter, ce me semble, avec trop d'apparat la chose la plus simple, et dont le détail méritoit le moins d'être rélevé heureuse∣ment la seule pratique de l'art peut nous en donner l'intelligence, et même sans faire tort au mérite de Lysippe, en faveur de qui tout le monde est prévenu, par les eloges de l'antiquité, et par l'approbation et le choix d'Alexandre le Grand, dont il étoit contemporain. Ce∣pendant l'explication de ce passage me paroit nécessaire pour con∣cilier toutes les idées; d'autant que ceux qui voudroient s'en tenir au texte simple croiroient ne devoir en rien rabattre, puisque les preuves de fait sont jointes à une description qui tient non seulement du merveilleux, mais qui répond aux grandes idées que l'on a des an∣ciens; personne ne les admet plus que moi, mais elles demandent

des distinctions. D'un autre côté les artistes et les amateurs des arts commenceroient par réjeter fort loin le fait, et ils le regarderoient comme impossible; car il faut convenir que Pline paroit, au premier abord, s'être mis ici dans le danger de ceux qui veulent trop prouver.</P>
<P>S'il étoit question, dans ce calcul, des ouvrages de Lysippe des statues de marbre, et même de figures de bronze de grandeur natu∣relle, ou faites chacune sur différens modèles (quoiqu'il en ait produit plusieurs de ce genre) le nombre de six cens dix morceaux de la main d'un seul artiste, ne seroit ni possible, ni vrai-semblable; la connoissance des arts, et leur marche dans l'exécution, vont heureuse∣ment servir à lever tous nos doutes.</P>
<P>Quand la pratique de la fonte est familière à un artist, et qu'il a sous ses ordres des gens capables de l'aider, les ouvrages se multiplient en peu de tems: l'artiste n'a proprement besoin que de faire des mo∣dèles en terre ou en cire, manoeuvre que l'on sait être aussi prompte que facile. Le moule, la fonte et le soin de réparer, sont des opera∣tions qui ne demandent point la main du maître; et cependant la figure n'est pas moins regardée comme son ouvrage. Ajoûtons à ces facilités que l'on peut jeter un très-grande nombre de figures dans le même moule, et sans doute que toutes les fois qu'il en sortoit une de son fourneau, Lysippe s'étoit imposé la loi de mettre à part un denier d'or, dont le nombre accumulé servit après sa mort à supputer la quantité de figures fondues dans son attelier. Il n'eût pas été dif∣ficile à Jean de Boulogne d'en faire autant de nos jours; et peut-être que si l'on comptoit le nombre de petites figures qu'il a produites de cette façon, on n'en trouveroit guère moins de six cens dix, indé∣pendamment des grandes figures équestres, et des autres statues ou bas-réliefs dont il a fait les modèles, et à la fonte desquels il a présidé.</P>

I shall soon introduce to my reader a Roman poet's description of the most memorable image of this kind, executed by Lysippus: but I will first notice a few of his most remarkable productions, on a larger scale.</P>
<P>The city of Tarentum was decorated with two colossal divinities by Lysippus,—a Jupiter and a Hercules. When Fabius Maximus made himself master of the place, he said, (according to Plutarch,) "Let us leave to the Tarentines their angry gods;" and he left them their lofty Jupiter; influenced, most probably, more by the difficulty of removing a statue, whose height exceeded forty cubits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>— Lysippi Jupiter ista,</L><L>Transivit quadraginta cubita altus Tarento.</L> <BIBL>LUCILLIUS Sat. lib. xvi. apud Ronium.</BIBL></Q> <P>Strabo speaks of this Jupiter as the second of colossal figures, in magnitude inferior only to the Colossus of Rhodes.</P></NOTE>, than by his devotional ideas; for he carried off the Hercules, a Colossus of in∣ferior bulk, to place it in the Capitol; and Plutarch censures this wary Roman for being more rapacious in Tarentum than Marcellus was in Syracuse.</P>
<P>Rome possessed another work of Lysippus particularly memorable, as it discovers the lively interest which the Roman people took in these Grecian ornaments of their city. The statue I allude to represented a man rubbing himself after the use of the bath. It had been stationed, with the usual solemnities, before the baths of Agrippa: but as it hap∣pened to delight the fancy of Tiberius, that subtle and cautious em∣peror was rash enough to remove it to his own chamber. The people demanded, by loud clamours in the theatre, that the statue should be restored to its proper place; and the sovereign submitted to its resto∣ration<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plin. lib. xxxiv. c. 8.</NOTE>.

<P>But to return to Lysippus. The work which was probably his own favourite performance, I mean his equestrian statues of Alexander and the guardian attendants of that idolized monarch, were transported to Rome after the Roman conquest of Macedonia, and adorned the Por∣tico of Metellus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Hic est Metellus Macedonicus: qui porticus, quae fuere circumdatae duabus aedibus sine inscriptione positis, quae nunc Octaviae porticibus ambiuntur, fecerat: quique hanc turmam statuarum equestrium, quae frontem aedium spectant, hodieque maximum ornamentum ejus loci, ex Macedonia detulit. Cujus turmae hanc causam referunt: Magnum Alexandrum impetrasse a Lysippo, singulari talium auctore operum, ut eorum equitum, qui ex ipsius turma apud Granicum stumen ceciderant, expressa similitudine figurarum, faceret statuas et ipsius quoque iis interponeret.—<BIBL>VELLEIUS PATERCULUS, lib. i.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Plutarch, in one of his Moral Treatises, has cited, with some ap∣plause, the two last lines of this epigram; and a very elegant, accom∣plished writer of our own country, Mr. Webb, has inserted a transla∣tion of them in his 7th Dialogue on the Beauties of Painting: but I think he has made the supposed speech of the hero rather more dis∣respectful to Jupiter than the Greek poet intended. I will give my reader an immediate opportunity of correcting me, if I am wrong in this supposition, by transcribing the couplet to which I allude:

<P><PB N="269" REF="275"/>We are indebted to Plutarch for the interesting anecdote concerning the just reproof of Lysippus to his brother artist Apelles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—PLUTARCHUS, de Iside et Osiride, p. 60. edit. Cantab. 1744.</NOTE>. The cha∣racter of this great statuary appears to have been so noble, that his life was probably as worthy of being recorded for its virtues, as his pro∣ductions were for their fidelity to truth and nature: yet, to our regret, we can know but very little of his personal history, and of his nu∣merous invaluable works. The two eminent antiquarians, Winkelman and Caylus, have supposed that not a single fragment remains. D'Han∣carville is inclined to believe that a bust of Bacchus, preserved at Por∣tici, is a real work of this exquisite artist; and his reasons for think∣ing so may serve to illustrate the peculiar excellencies of Lysippus.</P>
<Q>Le beau buste Bacchus en bronze, conservé à Portici, étant un chef-d'oeuvre de l'art, il fût nécessairement exécuté avant la perte des anciennes méthodes; et comme la tête de ce buste, comparée au col, seroit petite par rapport au reste du corps, comme le cheveux en sont admirablement bien travaillés, et comme on y remarque d'ailleurs la plus grande élégance dans les moindres parties, cela m'a faite dire ci-dessus que je croyois reconnoitre la main de Lysippe dans ce rare morceau, car ce sont les caractères que Pline donne expressé∣ment à ses ouvrages, lib. xxxiv. 'Statuariae arti plurimum traditur contulisse, capillum exprimendo, capita minora faciendo quam antiqui .....Propriae hujus videntur esse argutiae operum, custoditae in mini∣mis quoque rebus.</Q>
<P>In speaking of Lysippus, I musst not fail to observe that his brother Lysistratus was also an eminent statuary, and particularly distinguished as the first who executed portraits with the utmost exactness, by the in∣genious device of taking a cast in plaister from the face.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="276"/>In citing the words of Pliny, which celebrate Lysistratus for this in∣vention, I will venture to suggest a new reading in the passage, which may vindicate (as I imagine) this interesting author from the charge of having expressed himself rather absurdly on this subject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Hominis autem imaginem gypso e facie ipsâ primus omnium expressit, cerâque in eam formam gypsi infusâ emendare instituit Lysistratus Sicyonius frater Lysippi, de quo diximus. Sic et similitudinem reddere instituit: ante eum quam pulcherrimas facere studebant. Idem et de signis effigiem exprimere invenit. Crevitque res in tantum utnulla signa <HI>statuae∣ve sine argilla</HI> fierent.</Q> Quo apparet antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam quam fundendi aeris. Lib. xxxv. c. 12.—So stood the passage till the Paris editor of Pliny in twelve quartos made the following alteration: "ut nulla signa suâ sine argillâ fierent." By changing the super∣fluous word <HI>statuaeve</HI> into <HI>suâ,</HI> he hoped to rectify the weakness of the passage: but I appre∣hend another very slight alteration may improve it much more. Instead of <HI>sine agilla,</HI> I would read <HI>sine arte illâ</HI> considering those words as expressing the invention of Lysistratus, and giving a little better sense to the close of the passage, <Q>antiquiorem hanc fuisse scientiam, quam fun∣dendi aeris;</Q> which may then signify that this practice of casting the real features in plaister was prior to the formation of perfect portraits in bronze.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have seen it somewhere observed, that a statue, resembling the di∣minutive Hercules of Lysippus, was formerly in the possession of the celebrated Pithou, who has been called the Varro of France: but I apprehend that interesting work of ancient art has long ceased to exist; and as the animated poem, in which Statius has described the statue and its most amiable possessor, has not appeared (to my recollection) in our language, I shall conclude this note with an entire version of the Latin epistle I allude to, as the most pleasing tribute that antiquity has paid to the talents of Lysippus.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE IX. Ver. 399.</HI> And Grief's convulsion shakes the sphere of Art.</HEAD>
<P>M. de Caylus closes one of his Discourses on the Sculpture of the Ancients, in the Memoirs of the French Academy, with a circumstantial account of the Rhodian Colossus, collected from the authors of remote and recent times who have occasionally mentioned this most magnificent of all colossal figures, the memorable production of a little island once ennobled by the united influence of liberty, art, and naval power! Yet, after the researches of an accomplished writer, on a sub∣ject so attractive to his fancy, we must still remain in ignorance of some particulars relating to this interesting image, that a lover of the arts would be glad to ascertain. Much, however, is known. Pliny has described the fragments of this Colossus in clear and animated lan∣guage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ante onines autem in admiratione suit Solis Colossus Rhodi, quem fecerat Chares Lin∣dins, Lysippi supra dicti discipulus. Septuaginta cubitorum altitudinis fuit. Hoc simula∣crum post quinquagesimum sextum annum terrae motu prostratum, sed jacens quoque mira∣culo est. Pauci pollicem ejus amplectuntur. Majores sunt digiti quam pleraeque statuae. Vasti specus hiant defractis membris, spectantur intus magnae molis saxa, quorum pondere stabiliverat constituens. Duodecim annis tradunt effectum CCC talentis, quae contulerant ex apparatu regis Demetrii relicto, morae taedio. Sunt alii minores hoc in eadem urbe co∣lossi centum numero; sed ubicunque singuli fuissent nobilitaturi locum,—<BIBL>PLIN. lib. xxxiv.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>. The Greek epigram, containing its dimensions, varies (ac∣cording to different readings) from seventy to eighty cubits. M. de Caylus, forming his calculation from the expression of Pliny, that few men could embrace the thumb, concludes that the height of the per∣fect statue was about an hundred and five feet.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="287"/>We learn from Strabo that it was broken asunder at the knees, and that the Rhodians considered themselves as prohibited by an oracle from replacing it. They probably guarded the fragments with a religious veneration. I know not otherwise how to account for a very surprising fact, which my deceased friend Gibbon has recorded with his usual elegance and energy of expression. He observes, that <Q>after standing fifty-six years, the Colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake: but the massy trunk and huge fragments lay scat∣tered eight centuries on the ground.</Q> I cannot transcribe the words of an accomplished author, whose memory is so justly dear to me, with∣out reflecting, with poignant regret, what infinite advantages, for the improvement of my present work, I might have derived from his taste, knowledge, and kindness, had his life been extended according to my wishes. Gibbon, though he was not a collector of statues or pictures, had a lively esteem for all the fine arts.</P>
<P>I return to the Rhodian Apollo.—If we may trust the Byzantine writers, Theophanes and Constantine, the brass of this Colossus was gilt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—CONSTANT. de Adminis. Imp. edit. 1640, p. 45.</NOTE>. The Saracen chief, who invaded Rhodes in the year 672, seized and transported this ponderous plunder into Syria, where it was publicly sold to a Jew of Edessa. The story of loading nine hundred camels with the weight of these stupendous relies has the air of an Arabian tale. M. de Caylus imagines that modern writers have fallen into a great mistake concerning the attitude and the station of the standing Colossus, by representing it as a striding figure at the entrance of the port, as the reader may have seen it in ordinary prints, with ves∣sels failing between its legs. This intelligent writer rather supposes it to have been placed on the shore, upon a single triangular basis of white marble. He says that no ancient author, no ancient monument, is
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
found to countenance the modern supposition of a striding attitude: yet I apprehend the following epigram in the Anthologia, according to one mode of construction, amounts almost to a proof that the statue had a double basis; part on the land, and part in the water:</P>

<P>Winkelmann, who justly estimated the influence of freedom upon art, has observed, that after Greece was reduced to the condition of a Roman province, history mentions no Greek artist of any note till the period of the Roman triumvirate. "The liberty of the Greeks," says that animated author, <Q>was buried in the ruins of Corinth.

<P>The learned and enthusiastic historian of ancient art, in noticing its migration from the desolated cities of Greece into Syria and Aegypt, remarks, that being employed to serve the pomp and pageantry of courts, it lost an infinite portion of its grandeur and genius under the Seleucides and the Ptolemies. Yet he asserts, that under Ptolemy Phi∣ladelphus, "Alexandria became almost what Athens had been."</P>
<P>Is not this paying rather too high a compliment to the Egyptian mo∣narch? He was, however, a patron of art, and a lover of magnifi∣cence. His regard for a Grecian city, distinguished by talents, appears conspicuous, from a circumstance recorded by Athenaeus, in the de∣scription of a splendid festival with which Ptolemy amused himself and the people of Alexandria. In this gorgeous scene an immense multi∣tude of statues were carried in procession; and near to that of Ptolemy himself (who was attended by three oddly-grouped companions, Alex∣ander, Virtue, and Priapus) was the image of Corinth, adorned with a diadem of gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.—<BIBL>ATHENAEUS, p. 201.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Winkelmann imagines, from the profusion of statues which appeared in this sumptuous pageant, that a great number of Grecian statuaries found, at this peirod, an asylum in Alexandria. If they did, it is but too probable that their talents were enfeebled by their change of situa∣tion; since Winkelmann himself has observed, that of the artists who
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
then flourished in Egypt, we know only the name of a single sculptor, Satyreius, who formed, of chrystal, a portrait of Arsinoe the wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus; a performance celebrated in the following Greek epigram from the Fourth Book of the Anthologia:</P>

<P><PB N="286" REF="292"/>Winkelmann considers this representation of Arsinoe as an engraved gem: but I have seen a small bust of chrystal and porphyry united, which may possibly be the very portrait described by Diodorus.</P>
<P>Ptolemy was so fond of the arts and of his queen, that he is said to have projected a temple to her memory, so vaulted with loadstone, as to keep a metallic statue of Arsinoe suspended in the air; a project which the death of his famous architect Dimocrates is supposed to have defeated! Arsinoe happened to suffer, in a singular manner, in conse∣quence of her husband's passion for sculpture. In marrying his daughter to Antiochus king of Syria, Ptolemy had affectionately conducted the bride to Seleucia; and being charmed by a magnificent statue of Diana, he received it as a present from his son-in-law, and transported it to Alexandria: but Arsinoe falling sick on its arrival, saw, in her troubled dreams, the offended goddess, who complained of being removed from her Syrian temple. Ptolemy had tenderness sufficient to calm the dis∣turbed fancy of his queen, by sending back the favourite statue, but had not the reward he deserved for his humanity—the delight of re∣storing the health of his Arsinoe.</P>
<P>Winkelmann, in speaking of the arts at the court of Seleucia, asserts that the Grecian sculptors who migrated into Asia surpassed, in their works, such of their brethren as remained in their own country; and he quotes the last character of Theophrastus in proof of this assertion. In consulting the character referred to, I find nothing that can relate to works of art: but in a character very near the last, (the 23d, on Ostentation,) I find a passage which, if it proves any thing, may be thought rather to prove the reverse of what the learned historian of art has, in this instance, advanced with an inaccuracy very pardonable in an animated writer, whose researches were so extensive, and whose general merits are so great. Theophrastus makes his man of ostentation, who boasts of his campaigns with Alexander, contend that the artists in
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
Asia are superior to those in Europe; whence we may reasonably infer not that they really were so, but that Theophrastus rather thought the contrary.

<P>Whether we contemplate the excellence or the number of ancient statues that have been wonderfully recovered in the three last centuries, our obligations to Time, as a preserver, are such as may justly excite astonishment and gratitude. Had he restored only the Laocoon, the Apollo of the Belvedere, and the Medicaean Venus, a lover of the arts might consider his kindness in the department of sculpture, as equivalent to his literary beneficence in preserving the compositions of Demosthenes, Plato, and Homer. The liberality of Time, as a restorer, will appear in the strongest point of view, if we contrast what Poggio said of the statues in Rome, in the fifteenth century, and what the Abbé Guasco
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
wrote to his brother, on the same subject, about fifty years ago. I will transcribe the two passages I allude to; observing that the testimony of Poggio is the more to be depended on, as he was particularly fond of ancient sculpture. His delight in collecting fragments of antiquity is recorded by the accomplished historian of Lorenzo de Medici.—Ros∣coe, vol. ii. p. 196.</P>

<P>It is a supposition of Winkelmann, that the Rhodian sculptor Agesan∣der executed himself the figure of Laocoon, and Agesander's two sons, Athenodorus and Polydorus, the two younger figures of the group: an idea so pleasing, that the fancy and the heart are both willing to embrace it.</P>
<P>Felix de Fredis, a Roman citizen, had the good fortune to discover the Laocoon, and to receive from pope Julius the Second an ecclesiasti∣cal pension for his discovery. Leo the Tenth exonerated the revenues of the church from this pension, and gave to Fredis in exchange the post of apostolical secretary, in the year 1517. The raising of this, glo∣rious work of art from its grave might form, perhaps, a very interest∣ing historical picture; as some eminent personages might be introduced as spectators of the scene. The following Latin verses were written on the statue, soon after its revival, by the celebrated Cardinal Sadolet:</P>

On this occasion it is jus∣tice to exclaim with Cicero, "Odi falsas inscriptiones statuarum aliena∣rum."</P>
<P>The learned Figrelius, who has written at length on the statues of the Romans, relates some curious examples of this sculptural forgery. It appears, from the authority of Dio Chrysostom, that Alcibiades was turned into Aenobarbus; and according to Zonaras, even Constantine the Great did not scruple to put his own name on a statue of Apollo: but if he did so, we may hope it was rather to annihilate the worship he condemned, than to impose the figure of a Pagan divinity on the people as the real representative of a Christian emperor.</P>
<P>In justice to the Romans it is proper to remark, that they might pos∣sibly learn from the Greeks themselves the disingenuous practice of falsi∣fying the statues of ancient worthies. We know that Rhodes (one of the most magnificent marts of sculpture in the Pagan world!) incurred considerable disgrace by this species of falsehood, for which Dio Chrysos∣tom reproves the Rhodians in a very copious, animated, and beautiful
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
oration, which contains some interesting anecdotes of sculpture, and an eloquent description of its influence on the spirit of antiquity:</P>

<P>The learned and judicious Casaubon joins with Photius in pro∣nouncing this the best of all Dio's orations, and gives the following just account of the orator's intentions:</P>
<Q>Tam prolixa oratione hoc unum agit; ut Rhodiorum senatui ac populo morem dissuadeat, qui apud eos obtinuerat, statuas veteres transferendi ad aliorum honorem titulis mutatis, surdo figurarum discrimine. Non apud Rhodios solum haec consuetudo invaluerat: verum etiam apud Graecos alios et Romanos quoque..... sed nullus fuit populus qui rem risu dignam adeo usu frequentavit atque iste: cujus gloriae cum faveret Dio,....ob tam absurdum institutum acerrime eum objurgavit.</Q>
<P>There is another oration of Dio relating to sculpture, and particu∣larly entertaining. The orator with great dexterity expresses his sur∣prise, to the inhabitants of Corinth, that a brazen statue of himself, with which they had honoured him on his former visit, (about eleven years before,) had vanished from their city—a subject of great delicacy, and very gracefully treated, particularly in the close of the oration.</P>

<P>Marcellus, the plunderer of Syracuse, was perhaps the mildest of Roman ravagers. He is said to have dropped a tear of compassion on his conquest of that beautiful city. Mr. Pinkerton mentions an exqui∣site medallion, supposed to be struck by Syracuse in honour of this compassionate victor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on Medals, vol. i. p. 221.</NOTE>; who, tender as he was, did not fail to play the Roman, in carrying off the rich and tempting spoils in his power. The nature of those spoils, and the future consequences of such conduct, are finely described in the following words of Livy:</P>
<Q>Marcellus, captis Syracusis, quum caetera in Sicilia tanta fide atque integritate composuisset, ut non modo suam gloriam, sed etiam ma∣jestatem populi Romani, augeret; ornamenta urbis, signa, tabulasque, quibus abundabant Syracusae, Romam devexit. Hostium quidem illa spolia, et parta belli jure: caeterum inde primum initium mirandi Graecarum artium opera, licentiaeque huic sacra profanaque omnia vulgo spoliandi factum est; quae postremo in Romanos deos, templum id ipsum primum, quod a Marcello eximie ornatum est, vertit.

<P>The triumphant splendor of ancient Rome seems to have dazzled even the philosophical spirits of antiquity, and to have struck them blind to the predominant vices of her national character. These were arrogance and rapacity; vices generally stigmatized when they appear in an individual, and certainly not deserving a censure less severe when
<PB N="305" REF="310"/>
they form the characteristics of a nation. Yet so fascinating is the pride of successful valour, that the nation of antiquity most injurious in its conduct towards the rest of the world is often commended as an object for modern emulation. The most flagrant enormities of which the go∣vernors of France (both regal and republican) have been guilty, seem to have been greatly owing to an indiscriminate and fantastic imitation of Roman spirit; with a preposterous passion, sometimes concealed, and sometimes avowed, for universal dominion. The French appear to believe the Romans to have been what they supposed themselves to be— a divine race of men, destined by superior virtue to subdue the other nations of the earth; or, to use the words of their elegant but servile flatterer Virgil:
<Q><L>— progeniem virtute futuram</L>

<BIBL><HI>Aeneid,</HI> lib. vii.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>A Latin author, of an age not so polished, the Christian philosopher Arnobius, who wrote with the indignant warmth of an African, has drawn, in the opposite point of view, a forcible and faithful picture of the Romans, in the questions with which he concludes his animated in∣vective, "Adversus Gentes."</P>
<Q>Generis earn fuisse divini quisquamne hominum credat, aut ha∣buisse aequitatem diis dignam, quae humanis sese discordiis inserens aliorum opes fregit, aliis se praebuit exhibuitque fautricem: liberta∣tem his abstulit, alios ad columen dominationis erexit: quae ut una civitas emineret, in humani generis perniciem nata, orbem subjugavit innoxium.</Q>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XI. Ver. 168.</HI> And shar'd the immortality they gave.</HEAD>
<P>The Abbé Guasco has well described the deep and lively interest that the Grecians took in the perfection of art, and in the honour of its professors:</P>
<Q><P>L'autorité publique prenoit un intérêt très serieux à la perfection de l'art. A'Thebes ainsi qu'à Athenes il y avoit des loix tendant à proteger, et encourager les professeurs, et des loix pénales et pecu∣niaires pour ceux qui faisoient de mauvais ouvrages; elles défendoient même de s'occuper d'objets difformes ou communs.</P>
<P>La consideration et les distinctions qu'on accordoit aux artistes dans la Grèce, étoient très-propres à les encourager; loin d'être regardés comme des mercénaires à gage et des simples ouvriers, on les con∣sidéroit comme des hommes distingués, comme des esprits sublimes donés d'un génie divin, enrichis per l'étude, et polis par l'usage du monde, ils étoient mis au niveau des philosophes et des premiers per∣sonages de l'état, parvenant à ses premiers emplois, et partageant dans les fastes de la patrie l'immortalité qu'ils donnoient aux hommes illustres; il n'étoit pas extraordinaire de voir leur statues à côtè de celles des heros et des rois.—</P><BIBL><HI>De l'Usage des Statues,</HI> p. 421.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The Greeks indeed in general paid such honours very justly to their sublime artists: but the Grecian philosophers seem to have looked upon them with a very jealous (not to say an evil) eye. Even Plato and Plutarch have occasionally spoken of artists with a sort of envious disrespect that is particularly unbecoming in men of such cultivated minds. These two enlightened and benevolent philosophers might have reflected that an accomplished sculptor, whose art is properly di∣rected,
<PB N="310" REF="315"/>
may be considered like themselves as the true servant of moral philosophy.</P>
<P>A nation can hardly honour too highly the successful professors of any refined and arduous art, whose productions have an evident and graceful tendency to give elevation and dignity to national character: since, as Cicero says, very nobly in his Oration pro Muraena, <Q>Omnes enim artes quae nobis populi studia conciliant, et admirabilem dignitatem, et pergratam utilitatem debent habere. Summa dignitas est in iis qui militari laude antecellunt: omnia enim quae sunt in imperio, et in statu civitatis ab iis defendi et firmari putantur; summa etiam utili∣tus: siquidem eorum consilio et periculo, cum republica, tum etiam nostris rebus perfrui possumus.</Q></P>
<P>The true interest, honour, and lasting prosperity of a state seems to depend, in great measure, on preserving a due balance and reciprocal respect between arts and arms; for wherever too strong a predilection for either prevails, that very predilection (though it produces a blaze of success in a single path of celebrity) becomes a certain, yet unsuspected source of future destruction. Carthage was ruined by her passion for com∣merce, and Rome by her fiercer passion for war.</P>

towards the end of this Treatise, which paints the Romans, in very just and strong colours, as the plunderers of the world:</P>

<P>Herodes Atticus, the munificent citizen of Athens, was the accom∣plished son of a most fortunate father;—a father, who had not only the rare good fortune to discover, and obtain permission from the empe∣ror Nerva to appropriate to his own family a concealed and inexhaustible treasure, but the higher good fortune to find, and successfully cultivate, in his child, those talents and virtues which, instead of being corrupted by unbounded opulence, rather appeared to derive from it new energy and lustre. Herodes Atticus became not only the richest subject in the Roman empire, but he was at the same time one of the most studious, the most eloquent, and liberal of men. It was his noble maxim, that the wealthy ought to employ their riches, not only in relieving the necessities of the poor, but in saving those of narrow circumstances from sinking into poverty. Pausanias, who lived at the same period, has spoken with pleasure of the magnificent gifts bestowed by this generous Athenian on different parts of Greece. The most remarkable were, the Stadium that he formed at Athens, of the finest marble, extending six hundred feet; and statues of singular beauty and splendor, with which he decorated the temple of Neptune, on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Abbé Guasco, without mentioning his authority, asserts that this accomplished Athenian practised the art of sculpture himself:</P>
<Q>Le celèbre Hérode, surnomme l'Attique, ne crut pas se degrader en maniant lui-même le ciseau; et la Venus armée, dont il fut l'au∣teur, fait connoitre qu'il honoroit autant la sculpture par le bon gout de ses productions, que par la dignité de sa personne.</Q>
<P><PB N="322" REF="327"/>In consulting various ancient authors who have spoken of this inte∣resting character, and a modern Life of him by Mr. Burigny, in the Memoires of the French Academy, I cannot find any farther proof of his having added a talent for sculpture to his other accomplishments; and am therefore inclined to suppose that the Venus in question was a donation only, and not a work of Herodes. Its merit as a statue may be conceived from the following words of Damascius, preserved in Photius:</P>

<P>I cannot quit this memorable personage without observing, with pleasure, that after having obtained consular distinction at Rome, and enjoyed the friendship of a virtuous Roman emperor, he ended his days, in a good old age, (seventy-six,) at his favourite villa, the il∣lustrious spot of Marathon, where he meant to be privately buried: but the affection of the Athenians, who regarded him as a father, took the body from his domestics, and conveyed it, with the most honourable solemnity, to one of the public structures with which his munificence had decorated their city.</P>

<Q>Parmile grand nombre des monumens qu' Adrien fit éléver, le plus considerable étoit sans contredit l'immense edifice qu'il batit au pied de Tivoli, connu sous le nom de Villa Adriana, maison d'Adrien, dont les debris embrassent un circuit de près de dix miles d'Italie. Pour se former une idée de l'immensité de cette construction, il faut se repré∣senter qu'elle renfermoit presque toute une ville, des temples, des pa∣lestres, et une infinité d'autres édifices, entre autres deux théatres, dont l'un peut nous donner la meilleure notion de tous les edifices de ce genre. C'est le théatre le plus entier qui nous soit resté des anciens: on y voit encore le portique, les salles des acteurs, les escaliers par où l'on montoit au théatre, la porte de la scene, les portiques latéraux de l'avant scene, l'orchestre et la place des instrumens. Ce prince avoit imité dans ce palais tout ce que l'antiquité avoit en de plus celebre: le Lycée, l'Académie, le Prytanée, le Portique, le Temple de Thessa∣lie, et le Pécile d'Athene, il y avoit même fait représenter les Champs Elysées, et le royaume de Pluton.....Les statues qu'on a tirées des fo∣uilles de cette maison depuis deux cent cinquante ans, ont enrichi tous les cabinets de l'Europe, et il y reste encore des decouvertes à faire pour nos derniers neveux.</Q>
<P>It is thus that Winkelmann (in the Translation of Huber) speaks of this imperial villa, that seems to have surpassed the splendor of Asiatic magnificence. The liberality of Hadrian to the reviving cities of Greece, and particularly to Athens, is recorded by Pausanias, and forcibly ex∣pressed in the two following verses that were engraved in the Acropolis:

<P>The magnificent public works, and the motley character of this extra∣ordinary emperor, are singularly calculated to excite the opposite emo∣tions of admiration and disgust. His preposterous idea of deifying An∣tinous is sufficiently explained in the following words of the learned Spanheim:</P>
<Q>Le mignon d'Hadrien n'est que trop connu de l'historien de la vie de cet empereur; des passages de quelques anciens peres de l'Eglise, qui en font mention, et entre autres d'Origéne en plusieurs endroits de son excellent livre centre Celsus; et enfin par les temples, les au∣tels, les sacrificateurs, les jeux, les statues qu' Hadrien lui fit consa∣crer après sa mort; le tout selon Dion, pour s'être immolé volon∣tairement aux superstitions de son maitre. Ajoutez l'opinion qu'avoit ce même Hadrien, on faisoit semblant d'avoir que l'ame de cet in∣digne favori reçeue dans le ciel y tenoit la place d'un astre brillant, sur lequel il attachoit souvent la vue. C'est dequoy Julien aussi le raille, et en même tems raille en genéral les Grecs, qui par une hon∣teuse flatterie, avoient donné place à cet Antinous entre leurs astres, comme dans le globe de la lune, selon la rémarque de Tatianus, et qu'il se prouve encore aujourdhuy par leurs medailles.—<BIBL>SPANHEIM, <HI>Note sur les Cesars de l'Empereur Julien.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>The praise bestowed by history on Hadrian, in his character of a sculptor, "proxime Polycletos et Euphranoras," reminds me of the fol∣lowing anecdote in the imperial historian Vopiscus, concerning himself and his brother historians.</P>

<P>A temple (perhaps rather an altar) in Athens, dedicated to Mercy by the descendants of Hercules, is said to have been the first Asylum. To this the poet Claudian alludes:
<Q><L>— Flentibus aram,</L>
<L>Et proprium miseris numen statuistis Athenae.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Asylum that Romulus established in his new city is described in the Second Book of Dionysius Halicarnassensis. Ovid thus speaks of it in his Fasti:

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XI. Ver. 248.</HI> Rever'd his glory as a public trust.</HEAD>
<P>Diogenes Laertius asserts, in his Life of Socrates, that the Athenians immediately repented their conduct towards the philosopher, and ho∣noured his memory by a public statue of brass, the work of Lysippus! It is remarkable that two men, one esteemed the wisest, and the other the wittiest of the Greeks, Socrates and Lucian, were bred to the pro∣fession of sculpture. The vivacity of Lucian, and his antipathy to a se∣vere relation, his master, probably precluded that comic genius from making any considerable advances in an art which requires the steadiest union of industry and talent. But Socrates is known to have executed some works, as a statuary, that were objects of public regard. Pau∣sanias has noticed the Graces, in the Acropolis of Athens, as the work of the philosopher; and in observing that these and the elder Golden Graces of Bupalus were not destitute of drapery, he professes himself unable to discover what artist introduced the custom, prevalent in his time, of representing the Graces naked. Falconet imagines that statues executed by Socrates could have but a trifling degree of merit as works of art, from the philosopher's having quitted the profession very early in life: but the more candid Greeks seem inclined to applaud the laudable endeavours of juvenile talent; and a Greek epigram on a very young sculptor, Eutychides, speaks of him as equal to Praxiteles, though cala∣mitously hurried out of life at the age of sixteen:

En effet, s'il arrive que s'élevant au-dessus de sa foiblesse naturelle, une femme donne des exemples d'une vertu superieure, pourquoi la priveroit-on des honneurs patriotiques, pourquoi ôteroit-on de devant les yeux des monumens capables d'encourager son sexe à se vouer an bien public?

Perhaps the spirit of that indefatigable and illustrious Roman, if we could question him on the subject, would equally smile at the bitter de∣traction and the exaggerated praise, confessing ingenuously that he really deserved neither the one nor the other. In his great and unfi∣nished work it is certainly not difficult to find some considerable imper∣fections; yet taken altogether it is a most valuable and glorious monument of industry, intelligence, and good-nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XXIV. Ver. 460.</HI> And moral beauty decorates the whole.</HEAD>
<P>The Latin folio of Francis Junius De Pictura Veterum is a work of extensive erudition, and equal philanthropy. The very studious and amiable author was born in the Palatinate, 1599: he first embraced the profession of arms, but soon quitted it on the establishment of peace; and after travelling to France, he visited England, and resided for thirty years in the family of that illustrious lover of art, the celebrated earl of Arundel; a circumstance peculiarly favourable to his elaborate produc∣tion. The first edition of it was printed in Holland; but the second, with many additions, and a life of the author by Graevius, was published in London, 1694.</P>
<P>A letter from Grotius, dated Paris, 1638, in returning thanks to Junius for a copy of his book, contains the following judicious and ele∣gant description of its merit:</P>
<Q><PB N="346" REF="350"/>Miror diffusam lectionem, judicium, ordinem, &amp; quae ex cunctis artibus ad hanc artem ornandam attulisti.

Delectat varietas, multoque magis ex ista varietate consurgens pulchra species. Rogo te ut multa des nobis similia.</Q>
<P>Junius died at Windsor, in the house of his nephew Vossius: and the university of Oxford, to whom this most mild and laborious scholar bequeathed his books, has honoured his memory with an epitaph that contains the following very pleasing eulogy:

<P>The abbée Guasco had the misfortune to have his studies for a long time suspended, and at last terminated by a calamity peculiarly severe to a man of letters,—the failure of his sight. He modestly closes his learned and interesting work upon Statues with the following pathetic apology:</P>
<Q>Forcé par la perte de ma vue de quitter la plume, je vais vivre dans un repos auquel les lettres ne perdront rien. Je crains même que cet ouvrage ne soit une preuve que j'aurois du m'y livrer plutôt, d'autant plus que mon état ne me permet point de revoir &amp; corriger ce que

<P>The preface to the book I have just cited contains some pleasing let∣ters between the author and his brother, an officer of distinction, whom he had the misfortune to survive. The abbé was an honorary member of the French Academy; and he lived on terms of great intimacy with Montesquieu, as I discover from a little volume of letters that he pub∣lished soon after the decease, and with the name of his illustrious friend.</P>

<P>Though the eager enthusiastic spirit of Winkelman exposed him oc∣casionally to delusion and to ridicule, there is such a portion of solid and of splendid merit in his great work, the History of Art, as can hardly fail to confer upon its author an honourable immortality. The excel∣lencies and the failings of this animated writer are candidly displayed in the eulogy inscribed to him by his accomplished friend Heyne, the professor of Gottingen. In the copious tide of translations from the German which has recently enriched the literature of our country, it is matter of surprise and regret to those who delight in the arts, that the works of Winkelman have not yet made their appearance. He has found creditable translators both in France and Italy. Time will pro∣bably produce a collection of all his different works on design, in a becoming English dress, with a suitable account of a writer whose pro∣ductions
<PB N="348" REF="352"/>
are replete with learning, taste, and genius; and whose per∣sonal history is particularly interesting.</P>
<P>What an incentive to studious youth in the humble classes of life, to trace the son of a German cobler overcoming the perplexities of in∣digent obscurity, and qualifying himself to instruct the connoisseurs of Italy, and to preside over the antiquities of Rome. He was born at Stendal in Brandenburgh, 1717; and stabbed at Trieste by an itinerant Italian, who vainly hoped to rob him of some valuable metals that he had received as a present on his visit to the court of Vienna.</P>
<P>Winkelman, notwithstanding the many wounds he received, lived long enough to forgive his assassin, and to bequeath his property to his illustrious friend and patron cardinal Alexander Albani.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE XXVII. Ver. 520.</HI> And charm'd thy spirit thro' the shades of death.</HEAD>
<P>The delight and advantages arising from a lively and liberal passion for the fine arts were never more forcibly exemplified than in the youthful, and in the declining days, of that accomplished nobleman the Comte de Caylus. Born of a very illustrious family in 1692, he began his career of public life as a soldier; but on the peace of Rastadt, he amused his active spirit by travelling to Italy. In the course of his ex∣cursion, he made a frank offer of his sword in defence of Malta, then threatened by the Turks: the alarm of that island passed away, and the count returned to Paris. The love of travelling, and a passionate at∣tachment to the study of antiquities, now induced him to relinquish his military profession. He wished to visit the scenes of ancient art, and
<PB N="349" REF="353"/>
seized the opportunity of embarking for the east with a new embassador from his country to Constantinople. As they stopt at Smyrna, he was eager to survey the ruins of Ephesus; their distance from Smyrna was only the journey of a day. His friends endeavoured to dissuade him from attempting it, by displaying the danger he must incur, as the country was infested by a merciless banditti, under a formidable chief, Caracayali.</P>
<P>But in the Comte de Caylus (says his Eulogist) fear was always sub∣ordinate to desire. He accomplished his wishes by an adventurous de∣vice: clothing himself in a simple linen dress, and taking with him no∣thing that could tempt rapacity, he set forth with two of the banditti, who were suffered, from motives of public apprehension, to visit Smyrna occasionally. He had made a bargain with these men, on a promise of paying them liberally on his safe return. They conducted him, with an interpreter, to their captain. Caracayali, pleased with his animated visitor, took a pleasure in gratifying his curiosity. He told him there were ruins still nearer, that deserved his attention; and to convey him thither with the utmost celerity, he supplied him with two of the finest Arabian coursers. The Comte seemed to be transported by magic to the interesting spot: it presented to him the ruins of Colopton. After enjoying that unexpected and delightful scene, he returned to pass the night in a fort that formed the residence of Caracayali; and the next day he devoted to the ruins of Ephesus. Of the state in which he found the famous temple of Diana, he has left a memoir: but the nature of my present work does not allow me to dwell on the extended life and numerous productions of this engaging character: I hasten to speak of his latter days. After returning to France, and visiting Lon∣don more than once; after passing many years in active, though seden∣tary life, in various compositions, particularly his Academical Memoirs on different Branches of Painting and Sculpture, and his very compre∣hensive
<PB N="350" REF="354" MS="y"/>
Collection of Antiquities, this amiable practical student, and mu∣nificent patron of art, began in 1764 to shew that his robust frame was tending to dissolution. He triumphed for some time over the corporeal miseries of decaying nature, by the exertions of an active, enlightened, and affectionate spirit:—"Il visita," (says his eloquent eulogist M. le Beau, from whom I have drawn this brief account of his interesting hero,) <Q>il visita ses amis, les sçavans, les artistes, dont il alloit animer les travaux, tandis qu'il mouroit lui-même..... Tout étoit mort en lui, mais l'amour des lettres respiroit encore.—Il expira 1765.

<P>The incident which gave rise to the closing verses of this epistle is mentioned by M. de Caylus himself: in his Antiquities he expresses his gratitude to an unknown English gentleman, who had surprised him with an unexpected present of several valuable works of art, as a tribute of respect to his beneficent character, taking at the same time the greatest precautions that his own beneficence might remain anonymous.</P>
<P>This English gentleman was, I believe, the late Mr. Hollis, whose life was uncommonly devoted to the continual exercise of refined libe∣rality.</P>
<P>Many readers will smile at the romantic spirit of the wish which concludes this Epistle, and which, however suggested by considerate hu∣manity

and genuine patriotism, the temper of the times is so likely to realize.</P>
<P>Yet war is one of those universally afflicting and universally exe∣crated evils, to which both the spirit and the letter of Christianity seem to promise a perfect antidote:—its efficacy as such is certainly not vi∣sible at present; but it is still a comfort to a humane and contemplative mind to reflect, that its operation, however slow, must be ultimately successful.</P>

<P>The character of the British seaman is perhaps the most perfect and pre-eminent of all professional characters; or, in other words, the cha∣racter possesses, in the highest degree, the peculiar and varied excellencies which the profession requires: yet, though it is universally allowed that no class of men have been more zealous or successful in the pursuit of glory, perhaps none have been so scantily requited with those memorials of merit, which are necessary to make glory what Thucydides very hap∣pily called it—a possession for ever. May the justice and spirit of the nation be animated to such a completion of the projected naval monument, as may most gratify our present heroes, and most happily produce to our country, in a future age, a similar succession of defenders!</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOTE II. Ver. 74.</HI> Which even agony has smil'd to hear.</HEAD>
<P>The praise, so singularly deserved, and so tenderly bestowed, was excited by a few remarkable productions; the more remarkable, as the dear sufferer was, at the time, reduced to such decrepitude, that he was obliged to endure a great increase of pain whenever he indulged his fancy in a brief, constrained, and hasty use of the pencil! Yet under these severe disadvantages he executed some original designs that are thought, by less partial judges, to promise great future excellence, if Heaven graciously restores him from a state of the most calamitous and complicated sufferings, which he has now supported, for more
<PB N="355" REF="358"/>
than two years, with the mildest magnanimity. My reader has an op∣portunity of judging if I speak too partially of the designs executed by this dear invalid, as the Death of Demosthenes (which he drew, re∣clining himself on the couch of pain, for the affectionate purpose of decorating this Poem) is one of those I allude to. He will at the same time have the candour to recollect that this design is literally the pro∣duction of a youth severely obstructed in the exercise of early talent; and that <Q>the sculptor's art (by which is not meant merely finishing his compositions in marble, but forming, with correctness, figures in any material) demands infinite labour and patience (and maturity of life) to carry it to perfection.</Q></P>
<P>I borrow the words of an admirable little Treatise, intitled "Thoughts on Outline, Sculpture, &amp;c." by Mr. George Cumberland, an author who can employ, with alternate and masterly command, both the pen and the pencil.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="note">
<HEAD><HI>NOTE III. Ver. 144.</HI> And sighing, bids the imperfect paean close.</HEAD>
<P>I could wish (yet I must not expect such a wish can be realized) that all readers who may be subject to affliction like that which has made the close of this Poem so different from what the author meant it to be when the Work was begun, might find, in the perusal of it, a lenient relief similar to what I have found, when I could force myself to pursue a composition frequently interrupted by paternal anxiety, and frequently resumed from the influence of the same powerful affec∣tion, to gratify an intelligent and generous invalid. He often re∣quested me to pursue my Work at a little distance from him, that it might save me from sympathising too intensely in pangs that I could
<PB N="356" REF="359"/>
not relieve. Sometimes I could obey his tender injunctions; and some∣times I have been almost on the point of exclaiming, in the pathetic words of Virgil,
<Q>—— Bis patriae cecidere manus.</Q>
But at last, through a long vicissitude of hopes and fears for health in∣finitely dearer to me than my own, I am arrived at the close of the Work which this beloved promoter of my suspended studies has so kindly wished me to complete. I deliver it to the candour of the Public; not insensible of its imperfections, yet with feelings of grati∣tude to the great Giver of all gifts, that, under the bitterest disquietude and distress of heart, he has still granted me such powers of application, as have enabled me to sooth the corporeal anguish of a most meri∣torious and long-suffering child, and to beguile many, many hours of paternal affection.</P>

<P>WHEN the tide of affliction begins to flow, how dark and deep is the current!</P>
<P>In a few days after I had dispatched to the press the MS. of the introductory letter prefixed to this Poem, I received the affecting in∣telligence that my enchanting and inestimable friend Cowper had ex∣pired; and your beloved disciple followed, within a week, that dear departed genius, who had honoured his childhood with the tenderest regard.</P>
<P>I have now to thank you, my excellent compassionate friend, for a very hasty, but a very kind visit to the dear deceased object of our well-deserved affection and regret.</P>
<P>I am not afraid of your thinking that I exaggerate his merit, and speak too long or too loudly on a most dutiful child and a most dili∣gent disciple: to us, indeed, his juvenile talents and virtues had en∣deared him to such a degree, that our hearts, I believe, are perfectly in unison, while they re-echo his praise.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="361"/>If the mournful delight that I take in commemorating his excellence has tempted me to obtrude too much of his commendation on the eye of the Public, I trust that the benevolent spirit of my country will in∣dulgently accept the following apology:</P>
