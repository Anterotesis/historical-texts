<LG>
<L>YE to whose soul kind nature's hand imparts</L>
<L>The glowing passion for the liberal arts:</L>
<L>Ye great dispenfers of the magic strain,</L>
<L>Whose harmony delights almost to pain:</L>
<L>Ye to whose touch (with DAMER'S skill) is known</L>
<L>To charm to life, and wake the sleeping stone:</L>
<L>Ye rare PROMETHEI, to whose hand is giv'n</L>
<L>To snatch the flame that warms the breast of heav'n:</L>
<L>Ye too, ye Bards, illustrious heirs of fame,</L>
<L>Who from the sun your mental lineage claim:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4"/>
Approach and see a dear and kindred art</L>
<L>Unhallow'd maxims to her sons impart;</L>
<L>See her (become wild Faction's ready tool)</L>
<L>Insult the Father of the modern school.</L>
<L>Yet he first enter'd on the barren land,</L>
<L>And rais'd on high ARMIDA's pow'rful wand:</L>
<L>From him the Academics boast a name,</L>
<L>He led the way, he smooth'd their path to fame:</L>
<L>From him th' instructive lore the pupils claim'd,</L>
<L>His doctrine nurtur'd, and his voice inflam'd!</L>
<L>Oh, and is all forgot?—The sons rebel,</L>
<L>And, REGAN-like, their hallow'd sire expel.</L>
<L>Cou'd not his faculties, so meekly borne,</L>
<L>Arrest the hand that fix'd the rankling thorn?</L>
<L>Cou'd not the twilight of approaching age,</L>
<L>The silver hairs that crown th' indulgent sage,</L>
<L>Domestic virtues, his time-honour'd name,</L>
<L>His radiant works that crowd the dome of fame,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="5"/>
Say cou'd not these suppress th' opprobrious scene,</L>
<L>And charm to slumber academic spleen?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mark, mark the period, when the Children stung</L>
<L>The Parent's feelings with their serpent tongue;</L>
<L>It was while dimness veil'd the pow'rs of sight,</L>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The calamity here alluded to came suddenly upon Sir JOSHUA while he was painting.</NOTE> And ting'd all nature with the gloom of night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>(Not many days remov'd) the Master came</L>
<L>With wonted zeal to touch the swelling theme!</L>
<L>The pregnant canvass his creation caught,</L>
<L>And drank his rich exuberance of thought:</L>
<L>Deck'd with the beams of Inspiration's sky,</L>
<L>Glanc'd o'er the work his finely-frensy'd eye.</L>
<L>—Malignant Fate approach'd—the scenes decay,</L>
<L>To him the new creation fades away;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="6"/>
Thick night abruptly shades the mimic sky,</L>
<L>And clouds eternal quench the frensy'd eye!</L>
<L>Invention shudder'd—Taste stood weeping near—</L>
<L>From Fancy's eyelid gush'd the glitt'ring tear—</L>
<L>Genius exclaim'd, My matchless loss deplore,</L>
<L>The hand of REYNOLDS falls to rise no more!</L>
