<HEAD>ODE TO DRAGON, Mr. GARRICK's House-dog, AT HAMPTON.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>DRAGON! since lyrics are the mode,</L>
<L>To thee I dedicate my Ode,</L>
<L>And reason good I plead:</L>
<L>Are those who cannot write, to blame</L>
<L>To dedicate their hopes of fame,</L>
<L>To those who cannot read?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>O cou'd I, like that nameless wight <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the admirable Epistle to Sir WILLIAM CHAMBERS.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Find the choice minute when to write,</L>
<L>The <HI>mollia tempora fandi!</HI></L>
<L>Like his, my muse should learn to whistle</L>
<L>A true <HI>Heroical Epistle,</HI></L>
<L>In strains which never can die.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Father of lyrics, tuneful HORACE!</L>
<L>Can thy great shade do nothing for us</L>
<L>To mend the British lyre?</L>
<L>One luckless bard has broke the strings,</L>
<L>Seiz'd the scar'd muses, pluck'd their wings,</L>
<L>And put out all their fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>DRAGON, thou tyrant of the yard,</L>
<L>Great namesake of that furious guard</L>
<L>That watch'd the fruits Hesperian!</L>
<L>Thy choicer treasures safely keep,</L>
<L>Nor snatch one moment's guilty sleep,</L>
<L>Fidelity's criterion.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>O DRAGON! change with me thy fate,</L>
<L>To me give up thy place and state,</L>
<L>And I will give thee mine:</L>
<L>I, left to think, and thou to feed!</L>
<L>My mind enlarg'd, thy body freed,</L>
<L>How blest <HI>my</HI> lot and <HI>thine!</HI></L>
</LG>

<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Then shalt thou scent the rich regale</L>
<L>Of Turtle and diluting Ale</L>
<L>Nay, share the sav'ry bit;</L>
<L>And see, what thou hast never seen,</L>
<L>For thou hast but at HAMPTON been,</L>
<L>A feast devoid of wit.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Oft shalt thou snuff the smoaking venison,</L>
<L>Devour'd, <HI>alone,</HI> by gorging denizen,</L>
<L>So fresh, thou'lt long to tear it;</L>
<L>Tho' FLACCUS <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rancidum aprum antiqui laudabant: non quia nasus Illis nullus erat, sed, credo, hac mente, quòd hospes Tardiùs adveniens, vitiatum commodiùs, quam Integrum edax dominus consumeret.

<L>Of social souls who chose it stale,</L>
<L>Because their <HI>friends</HI> shou'd share it.</L>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>And then on me what joys wou'd wait,</L>
<L>Were I the guardian of thy gate,</L>
<L>How useless bolt and latch!</L>
<L>How vain were locks, and bars how vain,</L>
<L>To shield from harm the household train</L>
<L>Whom I, from love, wou'd watch!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Not that 'twou'd crown with joy my life,</L>
<L>That BOWDEN, or that BOWDEN's wife,</L>
<L>Brought me my daily pickings:</L>
<L>Tho' she suspends the scales of Fate,</L>
<L>And deals the scanty mortal date</L>
<L>To turkeys and to chickens!</L>

<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' fir'd with innocent ambition</L>
<L>BOWDEN <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. GARRICK's gardener.</NOTE>, great Nature's rhetorician,</L>
<L>More flow'rs than BURKE produces;</L>
<L>And tho' he's skill'd more roots to find,</L>
<L>Than ever fill'd an Hebrew's mind,</L>
<L>And better knows their uses,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>I'd get my master's ways by rote,</L>
<L>Ne'er wou'd I bark at ragged coat,</L>
<L>Nor tear the tatter'd sinner;</L>
<L>Like him, I'd love the Dog of merit,</L>
<L>Caress the cur of broken spirit,</L>
<L>And give them all a dinner.</L>

<LG N="12">
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>I'd copy too his blue-ey'd Wife,</L>
<L>A very Pallas on my life,</L>
<L>Yet I've a doubt just started—</L>
<L>For what shou'd Pallas have to do</L>
<L>With Venus, and her Cestus too?</L>
<L>Indeed they shou'd be parted.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Whene'er I heard the ratt'ling coach</L>
<L>Proclaim their long-desir'd approach,</L>
<L>How wou'd I haste to greet 'em!</L>
<L>Nor ever feel I wore a chain,</L>
<L>Till, starting, I perceiv'd with pain,</L>
<L>I cou'd not fly to meet 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>The master loves his sylvan shades,</L>
<L>Here, with the nine melodious maids,</L>
<L>His choicest hours are spent:</L>
<L>Yet I shall hear some witling cry,</L>
<L>(Such witling from my presence fly!)</L>
<L>"GARRICK will soon repent:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>"Again you'll see him, never fear;</L>
<L>"Some half a dozen times a year</L>
<L>"He still will charm the age;</L>
<L>"Accustom'd long to be admir'd,</L>
<L>"Of shades and streams he'll soon be tir'd,</L>
<L>"And languish for the stage."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>Peace!—To his solitude he bears</L>
<L>The full-blown same of thirty years;</L>
<L>He bears a nation's praise:</L>
<L>He bears his lib'ral, polish'd mind,</L>
<L>His worth, his wit, his sense refin'd;</L>
<L>He bears his grove of Bays.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>When others drop the heart-felt tear,</L>
<L>Because this Sun has left his sphere,</L>
<L>And set at highest noon;</L>
<L>I'll drop a tear as warm, as true,</L>
<L>I lov'd his beams as well as you,</L>
<L>And mourn they're set so soon.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>But all in vain his orb he quits,</L>
<L>Still there, in Memory's eye, he sits,</L>
<L>And will, till Time be done:</L>
<L>For he shall shine while Taste survives,</L>
<L>And he shall shine while Genius lives,</L>
<L>A never-setting Sun.</L>
