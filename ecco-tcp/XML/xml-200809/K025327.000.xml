<LG>
<L>THE law of custom is the law of fools—</L>
<L>And yet the wise are govern'd by her rules.</L>
<L>Why should <HI>Men</HI> only prologue all our plays,</L>
<L>Gentlemen-Ushers to each modern Bayes?</L>
<L>Why are the Fair to Epilogues confin'd,</L>
<L>Whose tongues are loud, and gen'ral as the wind?</L>
<L>Mark how in real life each sex is class'd!</L>
<L>Woman has <HI>there</HI> the <HI>first</HI> word and the <HI>last.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Boast not your gallant deeds, romantic men!</L>
<L>To-night a Female Quixote draws the pen.</L>
<L>Arm'd by the Comic Muse, these lists she enters,</L>
<L>And sallies forth—in quest of strange adventures!</L>
<L>War, open war, 'gainst recreant knights declares,</L>
<L>Nor Giant-Vice nor Windmill-Folly spares:</L>
<L>Side-saddles Pegasus, and courts Apollo,</L>
<L>While I, (you see!) her female Sancho, follow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye that in this enchanted castle sit,</L>
<L>Dames, squires, and dark magicians of the pit,</L>
<L>Smile on our fair knight-errantry to-day,</L>
<L>And raise no spells to blast a female play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft has our Author, upon other ground,</L>
<L>Courted your smiles, and oft indulgence found.</L>
<L>Read in the closet, you approv'd her page;</L>
<L>Yet still she dreads the perils of the stage.</L>
<L>Reader with Writer due proportion keeps,</L>
<L>And if the Poet nods, the Critic sleeps!</L>
<L>If lethargied by dullness here you sit,</L>
<L>Sonorous catcalls rouse the sleeping pit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Plac'd at the threshold of the weather-house,</L>
<L>There stands a pasteboard husband and his spouse,</L>
<L>Each doom'd to mark the changes of the weather,</L>
<L>But still—true man and wife!—ne'er seen together.</L>
<L>When low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing clouds the face of heav'n deform,</L>
<L>The muffled husband stands and braves the storm;</L>
<L>But when the fury of the tempest's done,</L>
<L>Break out at once the Lady and the Sun.</L>
<L>Thus oft has man, in custom's beaten track,</L>
<L>Come forth, as doleful Prologue, all in black!</L>
<L>Gloomy prognostick of the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a's disgrace,</L>
<L>With omens of foul weather in his face.</L>
<L>Trick'd out in silk and smiles let me appear,</L>
<L>And six, as sign of peace, the rainbow here;</L>
<L>Raise your compassion and your mirth together,</L>
<L>And prove to-day an emblem of fair weather!</L>

<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I THOUGHT I should find you here, my Lord: this new taste for solitude is a mortal symptom in your distemper. A lover seldom desires better company than his own thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been glad of your company, how∣ever. Why did you not join me sooner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I come now to bring you unwelcome news—the Earl of Belmont is in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father in town!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will, whom I sent to London upon some parti∣cular business, is just now returned, and tells me my Lord came from his country-seat two days ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Courteney, I shall never be able to look my father in the face.—To return to England without his orders—to be three weeks here under a borrowed name—If he has been informed of this, how can I excuse my conduct?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—That his Lordship, in his last letter to you at Paris, proposed a match to you; your impatience to see the lady made you anticipate his orders for your return; you left Paris <HI>incognito,</HI> saw the lady at Ranelagh, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are ready to obey him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! why will you trifle? You know I can∣not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cannot! my Lord—
<STAGE>gravely.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: Lady Ann does not please me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because Miss D'Arcy pleases you too well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, do not torment me, Courteney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, his Lordship will excuse the violence of a passion, which keeps you here at Windsor,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
under a fictitious name, sighing at the feet of a young divinity, that has visited this sublunary world in the shape of an humble dependant upon a haughty lady of quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a blunder has Fortune committed, to place her in that state!—Courteney, she is an angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An angel! Lovers have a fine creative fancy! It costs them little to make angels, goddesses, nymphs—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you apprehensive, then, that my passion for Miss D'Arcy may lead me too far?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, my Lord, there seems to be some reason for my apprehension.—However this may be, some particular business obliges me to leave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Particular business! Is this affair to be a secret to your friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no secrets that I would hide from you, my Lord. My sister, whom you have often heard me mention with tenderness, though I have not seen her since she was a child, has privately with∣drawn herself from an aunt, with whom she has resided since the death of her parents; and it is conjectured she is gone to Paris to meet me, my last letter to her being dated from thence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her aunt had made some <HI>prudent</HI> choice of a husband for her, perhaps—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—the old lady is a bigoted Roman Catho∣lick—and, having a large fortune to bestow, at∣tempted to make a proselyte of the poor girl, pro∣mising her, in that case, to settle her estate upon her. This failing, she laid a scheme for entrapping her into a convent; which my sister being informed of, fled to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who gave you this intelligence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A friend of my father's, whom I accidentally met with upon the terrace, who had seen me at Leyden, while I was at the university there, and knew me immediately. We cannot hope, you see, to be longer concealed; therefore it is absolutely necessary, my Lord, that you should present your∣self as soon as possible to your father.—What do you resolve to do, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me a day or two to consider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, in the mean time, my sister—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True—You ought to fly immediately to her assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And leave you here, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Do you doubt my prudence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship's in love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you think me weak enough to form a rash engagement with a young woman, to whose birth and circumstances I am wholly a stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in love, my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are determined, then, to acquaint my father with my being here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, unless you resolve to present yourself to him immediately. My friendship for you, my Lord, has already carried me farther than it ought: I have indulged you, in coming over privately, that you might gratify your curiosity with a sight of the lady your father designs for you; this done, you promised to go back with me to Paris, there to wait his express orders for your return; but you have not kept your word. You still linger here— my remonstrances have hitherto been fruitless.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since it must be so, I will go back with you to Paris.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were it not better to wait upon your father, who is perhaps, by this time, informed of your re∣turn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see my father; I cannot resolve to marry the lady he has chosen for me. Kind and indulgent as he has ever been, I have not fortitude enough to meet his frown — I will write to him when we get to Paris, and we will set out to-mor∣row. Now are you satisfied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, my Lord, your servant; I will go home, and give the necessary orders for our journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, pr'ythee, take a turn with me, dear Courte∣ney; my heart is oppressed, and I have a thousand things to say to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Lordship must excuse me; we have not a moment to spare.</P>

<P>If your Lordship is only for a short walk, I think I will accompany you.</P>

<STAGE>(laughs).</STAGE>
<P>So, you have a moment to spare then; confess honestly, that the sight of Miss Autumn has brought you back.</P>

<P>Miss Autumn! sure, my Lord, you do not imagine that I would neglect any serious busi∣ness for the conversation of such a vain coquet?</P>

<P>Not unless you were in love, Courteney.</P>

simplicity, has had art enough to ensnare your af∣fections.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Miss</HI> Autumn <HI>and Miss</HI> Courteney.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, my dear, when I told you this morning, that you would make but an awkward fine lady, you surveyed yourself in my glass with a certain consciousness
<STAGE>(<HI>mimicking her</HI>):</STAGE>
well, I will allow that you are tolerably handsome; but half that bloom which you brought from the country might be spared, provided you knew what to do with the remainder—indeed, Harriet, I am almost ashamed of your simplicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear whimsical friend, what faults have I committed lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faults! you never do one earthly thing that is right—all my documents are thrown away upon you—you blush, truly, when a sop looks atten∣tively on you—you cannot meet the steady gaze with the confident stare. You speak without lisping; walk without tottering, and courtesy without tossing back your head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is gross affectation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Harriet, you are a silly girl, with all your knowledge—you have spent eighteen years of your life in cultivating your understanding, without reflecting that it is by your beauty only you can hope to make your fortune; cease to be wise, child, and grow prudent; do not study the belle lettres, but the belle air—reason less with your tongue, and more with your eyes—why, really now, I believe you imagine nature gave you those two sparkling orbs for no other purpose but to see with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You railly your sex's follies so agreeably, my dear, that one would conclude you despised them, were you not too often seen practising them your∣self—your eyes serve you for many other purposes besides seeing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>My eyes, child, are well-disciplined troops; they know how to attack, conquer, pursue, retreat, beg quarter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beg quarter! I am sure they will never give any, if they can possibly help it—what an obstinate siege have they laid to the heart of poor Freeman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and they have carried the place at last, you find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what do you intend to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do with it—? why, throw a garrison into it, and march off to new conquests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt the place is not tenable, my dear; two enemies to your power, pride and resentment, have got admittance, and it is more than probable will expell your garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, would be a great disgrace upon my generalship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Freeman is a man of sense: he has per∣ceived that your design was only to torment him. You are too much and too little of a coquet, my fair friend; and have not artifice enough to dis∣semble the want of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prodigious! What, the sage Harriet taking upon her to give me lessons in coquetry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might profit by your faults, were I disposed to commence coquet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, since I find you have some skill, I may venture to consult you sometimes upon my opera∣tions; tell me truly then, do you think Freeman will escape me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he has already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>This would mortify me extremely, if I did not despise the rebel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I think him despicable, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, really! why, is he not handsome? has he not wit, learning, elegance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! and yet you despise him, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Despise him—why yes—and yet I do not despise him neither. — I only mean that I do not like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should you not like him? is he not hand∣some? has he not wit, learning, elegance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! to convince you that I do not like him, observe how ill I will treat him the next time we meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be the way to convince me that you do like him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strange indeed! you could not say more were I to treat him well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I should say as much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a mind to maintain paradoxes, I per∣ceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are mistaken, I have no mind to be ridiculous; the glitter of false wit, like the shine of false jewels, serve at once to shew the poverty and vanity of the possessor. What I mean, my dear, is, that if you are indeed—indifferent towards Mr. Freeman, you will treat him with that general po∣liteness, which a man of real merit is sure to meet with from a woman of sense: too much or too lit∣tle attention to such a man, is alike liable to be construed into a secret attachment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to this rule, my dear Harriet, you have certainly a secret attachment for his friend Mr. Belmour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(confused.)</STAGE>
<P>I, a secret attachment! why, is it possible you can have discovered—that is, that you suspect—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! no, my dear, your extreme reserve made me first suspect, and afterwards discover—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have you discovered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you love Mr. Belmour—aye, you may blush.—This was a secret that required all my sa∣gacity to discover; but as for his passion for you — any ideot might have found that out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet does not reserve become one in my circum∣stances? An unhappy orphan, compelled by my ill fate, to become a fugitive from the friend to whom I owed my past, and from whom I expected my future support; thus distrest — perhaps censured—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not hear you talk so, censured you cannot be; you have acted upon motives too justifiable; and I hope my fortune is sufficient to keep distress far from us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous Charlotte! yet if Lady Autumn should discover me, she will think it her duty to force me back to my aunt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly; what favour can youth and beauty expect from a coquet of fifty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, you make too free with the foibles of your father's widow; but you ought to remember, that, if she loves admiration at fifty, it is because she was a coquet at fifteen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; — I protest I tremble at the idea, of being one day, what my step-mother is at present. Oh heavens! in the midst of wrinkles and grey hairs, to dream of gentle languishments, vows, ardors!—but there is some comfort yet, fifty and I are at an immense distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not cheat yourself, my dear, with that thought; young though you are, you will be old: whatever advances with such rapidity, cannot be accounted far distant—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am determined to grow grave in time: dear Harriet, give me a lesson every day till you have compleated my reformation:—but is not that Freeman and Belmour yonder? They are certainly come in search of us; —come hither, Harriet—you

who pronounced the rebel had escaped me—mark that pensive air, those folded arms.—Well, my sage monitress of eighteen, will you pretend to assert that he is not thinking on me? Now can I not for my life resist my inclination to teaze him a little.—Do, dear girl, indulge me this once; I promise you, I will not be very cruel.—Nay, you shall prescribe the utmost limits of my triumph; and when you think I am carrying it too far,— only pull me by the sleeve, and I will instantly re∣collect myself.</P>

<P>That is your melancholy, is it not so, Mr. Freeman?

<P>To be sure, it is a sad thing, Madam; and I am very sorry for it.</P>

<P>No, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One morning, when I was sauntering in the forest, habited in a loose white sack, with my walking-crook in my hand—poor Lord Autumn used to say I looked like a nymph in this dress—I found myself fatigued, and was obliged to rest under a tree.—Here I sat, or rather reclined, in a pensive attitude, when I was roused by the sight of a monstrous snake, that had fastened on my arm—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMPLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord bless me! Madam, what did you do?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do!—I screamed so loud, that two young gen∣tlemen, who were walking at a little distance, came running to me:—both were eager to assist me;— but Mr. Freeman's assiduity was so animated, so languishing—so—so—in short, the blow was struck; I perceived immediately that I had made a violent impression.</P>

<SPEAKER>SIMPLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Madam, if I may be so bold, how did your Ladyship get rid of the snake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The snake!—O, I was mistaken: it was only a caterpillar, which my fears had magnified into a snake. Mr. Freeman then offered me his hand, to lead me home; but it was with such a timid aspect!—Since that day, his friend Belmour and he have been constant visitors at my house; and al∣though his passion has been continually increasing, yet he has concealed it so carefully, that no person in the family has discovered it but myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIMPLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll answer for it, Madam, nobody dreams of any such thing.—But I wonder the gentleman has not broke his mind to your Ladyship!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he has ever been silent, awfully silent, as to that point—such is his extreme timidity!— Timidity, Simple, ever accompanies a violent pas∣sion; for flames, as the poet says, burn highest, when they tremble most.</P>
</SP>

<P>I vow, Madam, here is Mr. Freeman coming, all alone. — Sure he intends to break his mind now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is he, indeed!—This can never be chance: he has certainly followed me hither. His passion has at length got the better of his timidity, and he is resolved to declare himself. — I must not be too re∣served—I must not kill his hope.—Simple, observe his looks when he accosts me.</P>

<P>Indeed, Madam, I must: there is an absolute necessity for it.</P>

to my care by my benefactor and my friend; and, should I encourage his passion for you, it would be such a scandalous breach of trust as would sink me below the meanest of mankind.

<P>O, dear Ma'am, you are quite mistaken; Miss D'Arcy has other thoughts in her head.</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, pray, say something. What have you seen? and what have you heard?</P>

<P>For that matter, Ma'am, nobody knows how to keep a secret better than I do.</P>

<P>Oh! if you have been trusted with a secret—I shall not tempt you to betray it, I assure you.—Go, and tell Miss D'Arcy, that I wish to speak with her here—</P>

<P>Depend upon it, Ma'am, Miss D'Arcy will con∣fess nothing; she has carried this matter too closely.</P>

<P>Nay, Ma'am, since you will have it—though, I am sure, I never thought to have told—</P>

<P>Be gone, impertinent; I will not hear you.</P>

<P>I would have told you before, Ma'am; but you were so nice about betraying a secret—you would not hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true;—but this is a secret which ought not to be concealed. You know, Miss D'Arcy is my friend—she may be taking some rash step.—It is fit I should enquire into this matter.—So, Mr. Freeman is <HI>her</HI> lover, then?
<STAGE>sighs.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BETTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am, I am sure he is; for you must know, Ma'am, that they met here, in this very room, to-day: I saw them with my own eyes;—I was passing by the door when they were in earnest discourse.—Now, I abhor listening, Ma'am—I am above it:—so I stood still, and shut the door half∣way, that they might not see me; but I could scarcely hear a word they said—they talked so low. —At last, I saw Miss D'Arcy burst into tears; and presently afterwards, Mr. Freeman threw his arms about her neck, and kissed her.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kissed her! and did she suffer that?</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS AUTUMN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that?</P>

<P>What is that to the purpose? Go on—</P>

<P>Absurd creature! What then?</P>

Perfidious Courtney! it is too plain he has supplanted me, basely supplanted me; and the story he has told me of his sister was in∣vented to excuse his sudden absence. Is this the friend who possessed more than a brother's part of my affections? I have been his dupe, his bubble: I will find him instantly, acquaint him with my detection of his perfidy, and demand satisfaction.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, my dear sister, I agree with you that Lord Clairville has acted with great delicacy; and this frank offer of his hand is a proof that his esteem of you is equal to his love—but do not carry your gratitude too far; do not encourage sentiments that must be suppressed: the Earl of Belmont will ne∣ver consent to your marriage—I am bound by ho∣nour to prevent it—endeavour then to banish him from your thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>To banish him from my thoughts, is—perhaps— not in my power; but never to be his without your approbation, I can, and do promise, because I am convinced you ought to act as you do.</P>

<P>And you hold to your resolution of going to∣morrow?</P>

<SP>

<P>I do.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does this generous self-denial endear you to me! Believe me, my dear Harriet, it wrings my soul to be obliged thus to oppose your happiness— were any thing less than my honour at stake— but you are just enough to perceive the reasonable∣ness of my conduct.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whom do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Autumn—my sudden resolution to leave her to-morrow, without being able to give her a satisfactory reason for it; and your design of con∣ducting me yourself, having by some means or other come to her knowledge, she suspects you are my lover, and her resentment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resentment! does the suspicion of my being your lover give her any concern?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But tell me, dear Harriet, is it possible that Miss Autumn can be jealous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous! what an inference has your vanity drawn! Miss Courteney thinks I have entered into some engagements with you, and considers my not having communicated them to her, as a breach of our friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(confused).</STAGE>
<P>Yes, to be sure—that is very natural—then she is angry—but, as you say, she considers it as a breach of friendship—that indeed accounts for her

<P>Perhaps I may not tell you that; but I will tell you whose heart she has touched.</P>

<P>No—now laugh if you will—but do not tell your friend; I would not swell her triumph, and be numbered in the list of her discarded admirers—</P>

<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no danger of that, I believe.</P>

<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a good sign, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And me she has ceased to love; now that she suspects me to be her rival. I can perceive her heart is torn with jealousy, yet she affects her usual gaiety and unconcern—but indifference is of all

<P>This must be owing to some <HI>imprudence</HI>—I doubt—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your relation to me being a secret, this has raised a suspicion of my having entered into a clan∣destine engagement with you: on this account, Miss Autumn has withdrawn her friendship from me, Lord Clairville despises me, and you are be∣come the object of his resentment. All these in∣conveniences might have been prevented, had you declared yourself my brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not.—Obliged as I am in honour to oppose Lord Clairville's passion for you, had I ac∣knowledged you to be my sister, I should have ex∣posed myself to importunities, which it would have been difficult to have rejected; and, after all, my conduct might have had the appearance of arti∣fice.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, Madam; he left Paris with his governor some weeks ago, without acquainting me with their intention; and, as I am informed, have passed the greatest part of their time here.—Are there not two young gentlemen, who visit your Ladyship under the names of Belmour and Free∣man?</P>

<P>Pray, my Lord, which of them is your son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He who calls himself Belmour; the other is his governor, a young man of a good family, but low fortunes, whose father was my friend; and upon that account, as well as for the good qualities I observed in him, I determined to take care of his fortune; I placed him at the university of Leyden, and, when he had finished his studies, sent him to travel with my son, to whose care I confided him—young as he is, his merit justified my choice of him for this trust.</P>

<P>No doubt of it, my Lord;—all the world must approve of your choice; Mr. Freeman's merit— but Freeman is not his name, your Lordship says?</P>

<P>No, Madam; Courteney is his real name.</P>

<P>Courteney!—your Lordship had reason to say he is of a good family!—Courteney is a name that any person might be proud to own.</P>

<P>I see, Madam, you are prejudiced in his favour; I am not surprised at it—Courteney has many good qualities; but to me he has shewn himself ungrateful.

<P>I brought my young Lord his pistols, as he com∣manded me; and, to be sure, I believe some mischief is going forwards; for I know my Lord and his governor have quarrelled: I overheard them in the garden; I was behind an hedge—a challenge passed between them; and my young Lord, meeting me, sent me to bring his case of pistols. I fol∣lowed my Lord unobserved, and saw which way he went; and some time afterwards I saw Mr. Courte∣ney taking the same path.</P>

<P>Be calm, and hear the event; he brought pistols, and insisted upon my taking one; he then bid me fire: I refused, saying, that, as I was resolved he should in every point be the aggressor, he should fire first; he did, and missed me, and on my soul I believe designedly; for by the changes in his coun∣tenance, I could perceive that grief, and not anger, was then the predominant passion in his mind—my turn was next; I fired my pistol in the air, then calmly told him, that his father was here, and that I would explain myself in his presence; he spoke not a word, but bowed and left me, and we took differ∣ent paths to the house—but tell me, dear Harriet, does Miss Autumn seem to know her mother's fa∣vourable intentions? has she acknowledged any thing to you?</P>

<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rise, Clairville; you have been to blame, but so have I; your fault has been the consequence of my imprudent choice of a governor for you. You have forgot your duty, but he was your seducer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord; whatever reason I may have to complain of Mr. Courteney in one particular in∣stance in which I only am concerned, yet let me justify to yourself your choice: he has in every re∣spect fulfilled your intentions, and faithfully dis∣charged the trust which you reposed in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faithfully discharged his trust! he who could engage in licentious brawls with his pupil, and at∣tempt the life of one committed to his care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be silent, you can say nothing that can exte∣nuate guilt like this. Mr. Courteney, after what has happened, you must not reckon upon my friend∣ship—the salary I allowed you while travelling with my son, is yours for life—but we must meet no more; if you consider the loss of my protection
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
as a misfortune, remember you have yourself only to blame for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is but one real misfortune, my Lord, which a man can suffer; and that is, when he is conscious of a crime, and has any thing to re∣proach himself with. The salary your Lordship offers me I will not accept; judging of me as you do, you cannot mean it as a reward; and, low as my fortunes are, I will not be indebted to compas∣sion, for that which your esteem only ought to be∣stow upon me. Lord Clairville, I promised you an explanation before your father; and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Sir; it is but just that I should first clear you of an imputation which cannot wound you, more than it has me.—My Lord, you have re∣proached Mr. Courteney without cause; he sought not my life, but gave it me when in his power: I urged him with the most opprobrious terms to ac∣cept my challenge; and when my rashness had given him an advantage, he forbore to take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this be true, I have wronged him, greatly wronged him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Courteney, a treacherous rival and a gene∣rous enemy! how can you reconcile this contra∣diction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never was your rival, my Lord; it is my sister whom you have all this time addressed under the name of D'Arcy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss D'Arcy your sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither she nor I knew this circumstance till to∣day, when an accident which I shall ever remem∣ber discovered us to each other. I opposed your passion for her at first through prudence; but, when I knew her to be my sister, my honour was more immediately concerned, to prevent the continuance of an attachment which could never have the sanc∣tion of your father's consent; my sister, with a spi∣rit becoming her birth, adopted my sentiments; she refused your offered hand, and consented that I should conduct her where you could not have ac∣cess to her; hence rose your jealousy, and the con∣sequences that followed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Courteney, you have acted nobly in this affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done my duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what brought your sister hither? and why did she conceal her name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She took refuge with Miss Autumn from the bigotry of her aunt, who, not having been able to pervert her to the Roman Catholick religion by the offer of settling her whole fortune upon her, was laying schemes to entrap her into a convent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LORD BELMONT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Something of this I heard before, and had determined to enquire into it.—Is Miss Courteney still here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURTENEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is, my Lord; but to-morrow I shall take her into the country; Lord Clairville will then, I hope, forget a slight impression, which he will have no oppurtunity of increasing.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER>CLAIRVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! my Lord, were it possible for me to cease to love Miss Courteney, your commands were suf∣ficient.—In this, and only in this one point, I can∣not obey you.</P>

<SP>
<L>WHAT! five long acts—and all to make us wiser!</L>
<L>Our authoress sure has wanted an adviser.</L>
<L>Had she consulted <HI>me,</HI> she should have made</L>
<L>Her moral play a speaking masquerade.</L>
<L>Warm'd up each bustling scene, and in her rage</L>
<L>Have emptied all the Green-room on the stage.</L>
<L>My life on't, this had kept her play from sinking,</L>
<L>Have pleas'd our eyes, and sav'd the pain of thinking.</L>
<L>Well, since she thus has shewn her want of skill,</L>
<L>What if I give a masquerade? I will.</L>
<L>But how! ay, there's the rub!
<STAGE>(pausing)</STAGE>
I've got my cue:</L>
<L>The world's a masquerade! the masquers, you, you, you.</L>
<STAGE>To Boxes, Pit, Gall.</STAGE>
<L>Lud! what a groupe the motley scene discloses!</L>
<L>False wits, false wives, false virgins, and false spouses:</L>
<L>Statesmen with bridles on; and, close beside 'em,</L>
<L>Patriots, in party colour'd suits, that ride 'em.</L>
<L>There Hebes, turn'd of fifty, try once more,</L>
<L>To raise a flame in Cupids of threescore.</L>
<L>These, in their turn, with appetites as keen,</L>
<L>Deserting fifty, fasten on fifteen.</L>
<L>Miss, not yet full fifteen, with fire uncommon,</L>
<L>Flings down her sampler, and takes up the woman:</L>
<L>The little urchin smiles, and spreads her lure,</L>
<L>And tries to kill ere she's got power to cure.</L>
<L>Thus 'tis with all—Their chief and constant care</L>
<L>Is to seem every thing—but what they are.</L>
<L>Yon broad, bold, angry, spark, I fix my eye on,</L>
<L>Who seems t' have robb'd his vizor from the lion,</L>
<L>Who frowns, and talks, and swears, with round parade.</L>
<L>Looking, as who should say, <HI>Damme! who's afraid!</HI>
<STAGE>mimicking.</STAGE></L>
<L>Strip but his vizor off, and sure I am,</L>
<L>You'll find his lionship a very lamb.</L>
<L>Yon politician, famous in debate,</L>
<L>Perhaps to vulgar eyes bestrides the state;</L>
<L>Yet, when he deigns his real shape t' assume,</L>
<L>He turns old woman, and bestrides a broom.</L>
<L>Yon patriot too, who presses on your sight,</L>
<L>And seems to every gazer all in white;</L>
<L>If with a bribe his candour you attack,</L>
<L>He bows, turns round, and whip—the man's a black!</L>
<L>Yon critic too—but whither do I run?</L>
<L>If I proceed, our bard will be undone!</L>
<L>Well then, a truce, since she requests it too;</L>
<L>Do you spare her, and I'll for once spare you.</L>
