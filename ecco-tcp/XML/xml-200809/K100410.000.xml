<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HILE, own'd by You, with Smiles the Muse surveys,</L>
<L>Th' expected Triumph of her sweetest Lays:</L>
<L>While, stretch'd at Ease, she boasts your Guardian Aid,</L>
<L>Secure, and happy in her sylvan Shade:</L>
<L>Excuse her Fears, who scarce a Verse bestows,</L>
<L>In just Remembrance of the Debt she owes;</L>
<L>With conscious Awe she hears the Critic's Fame,</L>
<L>And blushing hides her Wreath at <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Long slighted <HI>Fancy,</HI> with a Mother's Care,</L>
<L>Wept o'er his Works, and felt the last Despair.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Torn from her Head, she saw the Roses fall,</L>
<L>By all deserted, tho' admir'd by all.</L>
<L>" And oh! she cry'd, shall Science still resign</L>
<L>" Whate'er is Nature's, and whate'er is mine?</L>
<L>" Shall <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Art,</HI> but shew a cold Regard,</L>
<L>" And scornful Pride reject th' unletter'd Bard?</L>
<L>" Ye myrtled Nymphs, who own my gentle Reign,</L>
<L>" Tune the sweet Lyre, and grace my airy Train!</L>
<L>" If, where ye rove, your searching Eyes have known</L>
<L>" One perfect Mind, which Judgment calls its own:</L>
<L>" There ev'ry Breast its fondest Hopes must bond,</L>
<L>" And ev'ry Muse with Tears await her Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then fair <HI>Isis</HI> from her Stream arose,</L>
<L>In kind Compassion of her Sister's Woes.</L>
<L>'Twas then she promis'd to the mourning Maid</L>
<L>Th' immortal Honours, which thy Hands have paid:</L>
<L>" My best-lov'd Son (she said) shall yet restore</L>
<L>" Thy ruin'd Sweets, and Fancy weep no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>Each rising Art by slow Gradation moves,</L>
<L>Toil builds on Toil, and Age on Age improves.</L>
<L>The Muse alone unequal dealt her Rage,</L>
<L>And grac'd with noblest Pomp her earliest Stage.</L>
<L>Preserv'd thro' Time, the speaking Scenes impart</L>
<L>Each changeful Wish of <HI>Phaedra</HI>'s tortur'd Heart:</L>
<L>Or paint the Curse, that mark'd the <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Oedipus</HI> of <HI>Sophocles.</HI></NOTE><HI>Theban</HI>'s Reign,</L>
<L>A Bed incestuous, and a Father slain.</L>
<L>Line after Line, our pitying Eyes o'erflow,</L>
<L>Trace the sad Tale, and own another's Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To <HI>Rome</HI> remov'd, with equal Pow'r to please,</L>
<L>The <HI>Comic</HI> Sisters kept their native Ease.</L>
<L>With jealous Fear declining <HI>Greece</HI> beheld</L>
<L>Her own <HI>Menander</HI>'s Art almost excell'd!</L>
<L>But ev'ry Muse essay'd to raise in vain.</L>
<L>Some labour'd Rival of her <HI>Tragic</HI> Strain;</L>
<L><HI>Ilissus'</HI> Laurels, tho' transferr'd with Toil,</L>
<L>Droop'd their fair Leaves, nor knew th' unfriendly Soil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<L>When <HI>Rome</HI> herself, her envy'd Glories dead,</L>
<L>No more Imperial, stoop'd her conquer'd Head:</L>
<L>Luxuriant <HI>Florence</HI> chose a softer Theme,</L>
<L>While all was Peace, by <HI>Arno</HI>'s silver Stream.</L>
<L>With sweeter Notes th' <HI>Etrurian</HI> Vales complain'd,</L>
<L>And Arts reviving told—a <HI>Cosmo</HI> reign'd.</L>
<L>Their wanton Lyres the Bards of <HI>Provence</HI> strung,</L>
<L>Sweet flow'd the Lays, but Love was all they sung.</L>
<L>The gay Description could not fail to move,</L>
<L>For, led by Nature, all are Friends to Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But Heav'n, still rising in its Works, decreed</L>
<L>The perfect Boast of Time should last succeed.</L>
<L>The beauteous Union must appear at length,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Tuscan</HI> Fancy, and <HI>Athenian</HI> Strength:</L>
<L>One greater Muse <HI>Eliza</HI>'s Reign adorn,</L>
<L>And ev'n a <HI>Shakespear</HI> to her Fame be born!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet ah! so bright her Morning's op'ning Ray,</L>
<L>In vain our <HI>Britain</HI> hop'd an equal Day!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
No second Growth the Western Isle could bear,</L>
<L>At once exhausted with too rich a Year.</L>
<L>Too nicely <HI>Johnson</HI> knew the Critic's Part;</L>
<L>Nature in him was almost lost in Art.</L>
<L>Of softer Mold the gentle <HI>Fletcher</HI> came,</L>
<L>The next in Order, as the next in Name.</L>
<L>With pleas'd Attention 'midst his Scenes we find</L>
<L>Each glowing Thought, that warms the Female Mind;</L>
<L>Each melting Sigh, and ev'ry tender Tear,</L>
<L>The Lover's Wishes and the Virgin's Fear.</L>
<L>His <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Their Characters are thus distinguish'd by Mr. <HI>Dryden.</HI></NOTE> ev'ry Strain the Loves and Graces own;</L>
<L>But stronger <HI>Shakespear</HI> felt for <HI>Man</HI> alone:</L>
<L>Drawn by his Pen, our ruder Passions stand</L>
<L>Th' unrivall'd Picture of his early Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With gradual Steps, and slow, exacter <HI>France</HI></L>
<L>Saw Art's fair Empire o'er her Shores advance:</L>
<L>By length of Toil, a bright Perfection knew,</L>
<L>Correctly bold, and just in all she drew.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Till late <HI>Corneille</HI> from Epick <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The favourite Author of the Elder <HI>Corneille.</HI></NOTE><HI>Lucan</HI> brought</L>
<L>The full Expression, and the <HI>Roman</HI> Thought;</L>
<L>And classic Judgment gain'd to sweet <HI>Racine</HI></L>
<L>The temp'rate Strength of <HI>Maro's</HI> chaster Line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But wilder far the <HI>British</HI> Laurel spread,</L>
<L>And Wreaths less artful crown our Poet's Head.</L>
<L>Yet He alone to ev'ry Scene could give</L>
<L>Th' Historian's Truth, and bid the Manners live.</L>
<L>Wak'd at his Call I view, with glad Surprize,</L>
<L>Majestic Forms of mighty Monarchs rise.</L>
<L>There <HI>Henry</HI>'s Trumpets spread their loud Alarms,</L>
<L>And laurel'd Conquest waits her Hero's Arms.</L>
<L>Here gentler <HI>Edward</HI> claims a pitying Sigh,</L>
<L>Scarce born to Honours, and so soon to die!</L>
<L>Yet shall thy Throne, unhappy Infant, bring</L>
<L>No Beam of Comfort to the guilty King?</L>
<L>The <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tempus erit Turno, magno cum optaverit emptum Intactum Pallanta, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Time shall come, when <HI>Glo'ster</HI>'s Heart shall bleed</L>
<L>In Life's last Hours, with Horror of the Deed:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8"/>
When dreary Visions shall at last present</L>
<L>Thy vengeful Image, in the midnight Tent:</L>
<L>Thy Hand unseen the secret Death shall bear,</L>
<L>Blunt the weak Sword, and break th' oppressive Spear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where'er we turn, by Fancy charm'd, we find</L>
<L>Some sweet Illusion of the cheated Mind.</L>
<L>Oft, wild of Wing, she calls the Soul to rove</L>
<L>With humbler Nature, in the rural Grove;</L>
<L>Where Swains contented own the quiet Scene,</L>
<L>And twilight Fairies tread the circled Green:</L>
<L>Drest by her Hand, the Woods and Vallies smile,</L>
<L>And Spring diffusive decks th' <HI>enchanted Isle.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O blest in all that Genius gives to charm,</L>
<L>Whose Morals mend us, and whose Passions warm!</L>
<L>Oft let my Youth attend thy various Page,</L>
<L>Where rich Invention rules th' unbounded Stage.</L>
<L>There ev'ry Scene the Poet's Warmth may raise,</L>
<L>And melting Music find the softest Lays.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
O might the Muse with equal Ease persuade,</L>
<L>Expressive Picture, to adopt thine Aid!</L>
<L>Some pow'rful <HI>Raphael</HI> shou'd again appear,</L>
<L>And Arts consenting fix their Empire here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methinks ev'n now I view some fair Design,</L>
<L>Where breathing Nature lives in ev'ry Line:</L>
<L>Chaste, and subdu'd, the modest Colours lie,</L>
<L>In fair Proportion to th' approving Eye—</L>
<L>And see, where <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Tragedy of <HI>Julius Caesar.</HI></NOTE><HI>Antony</HI> lamenting stands</L>
<L>In fixt Distress, and spreads his pleading Hands!</L>
<L>O'er the pale Corse the Warrior seems to bend,</L>
<L>Deep sunk in Grief, and mourns his murther'd Friend!</L>
<L>Still as they press, he calls on all around,</L>
<L>Lifts the torn Robe, and points the bleeding Wound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coriolanus.</HI> See Mr. <HI>Spence</HI>'s Dialogues on the <HI>Odyssey.</HI></NOTE> who is he, whose Brows exalted bear</L>
<L>A Rage impatient, and a fiercer Air?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Ev'n now, his Thoughts with eager Vengeance doom</L>
<L>The last sad Ruin of ungrateful <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Till, slow-advancing o'er the tented Plain,</L>
<L>In sable Weeds, appear the Kindred-train:</L>
<L>The frantic Mother leads their wild Despair,</L>
<L>Beats her swoln Breast, and rends her silver Hair.</L>
<L>And see he yields!—the Tears unbidden start,</L>
<L>And conscious Nature claims th' unwilling Heart!</L>
<L>O'er all the Man conflicting Passions rise,</L>
<L><HI>Rage</HI> grasps the Sword, while <HI>Pity</HI> melts the Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, gen'rous Critic, as thy Bard inspires,</L>
<L>The Sister Arts shall nurse their drooping Fires;</L>
<L>Each from his Scenes her Stores alternate bring,</L>
<L>Spread the fair Tints, or wake the vocal String:</L>
<L>Those <HI>Sibyl-</HI>Leaves, the Sport of ev'ry Wind,</L>
<L>(For Poets ever were a careless Kind)</L>
<L>By thee dispos'd, no farther Toil demand,</L>
<L>But, just to Nature, own thy forming Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
<L>So spread o'er <HI>Greece,</HI> th' harmonious Whole un∣known,</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Homer</HI>'s Numbers charm'd by Parts alone.</L>
<L>Their own <HI>Ulysses</HI> scarce had wander'd more,</L>
<L>By Winds and Waters cast on ev'ry Shore:</L>
<L>When, rais'd by Fate, some former <HI>Hanmer</HI> join'd</L>
<L>Each beauteous Image of the tuneful Mind:</L>
<L>And bad, like Thee, his <HI>Athens</HI> ever claim,</L>
<L>A fond Alliance, with the Poet's Name.</L>
