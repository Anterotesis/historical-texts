<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHEERLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>LAURA has not appeared at the window yes∣terday or to-day, and my word is passed not to call at the house till she sends to me—yet I cannot get under weigh till she bids me farewell. Oh, confound it! here's Captain Vain. What damn'd shift of wind made him bring up on this coast? Now will this conceited fellow bother me for an hour or two about himself.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Going.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> VAIN.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> see you, Cheerly. You can't hide your∣self from <HI>me.</HI> I'm one who see every thing in a
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>moment. You have heard what has happened to <HI>me</HI> since <HI>I</HI> went?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, I have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most extraordinary thing. Always something surprizing wherever <HI>I</HI> go. For my part <HI>I</HI> really think as to <HI>myself,</HI> that—But what are you at, Cheerly? What! attempting to spy into your neighbour's cabin! Just like <HI>me,</HI> egad! I've done that often in my time, tho' it's hardly fair play, between you and <HI>I.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vain, you know a seaman cannot act unfairly; here is a little frigate in this harbour, of which I wou'd fain take the command honor∣ably; but her old uncle thinks me too poor to hold the commission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly <HI>me</HI> again. Egad! I had best give a little thought to your case <HI>myself.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have told you where my anchor lies. Can you lend me a hand to purchase it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can I? I don't like to praise myself; but I am such a devilish clever fellow; it is quite astonishing—I never turn my head to a project but it succeeds—Any thing, every thing—never miss—I'am so clever. <HI>I'll</HI> tell you—What will you give me for releasing this tender, consenting girl from old Brummagem's clutches, and throw∣ing her into your arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; what premium will you allow me on her fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not a seaman's language—I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, Cheerly, I love adven∣tures—I have a genius for them, and such a head at them, it's astonishing. But as this is a time of the world when a man is counted an ass if he be not paid for every thing he does, I undertake them no longer as an amateur—I have done with that—but demand my fee regularly as a professor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have adventured myself, in the service of others, into easy circumstances and genteel ac∣quaintance: and if you will give me a hundred pounds, of which I happen to be just now damna∣bly in want—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Vain—That's not quite so clever,—is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but that's so common a case with a genius—In short, if you are inclined to pay, <HI>I'll</HI> put you in possession of your Dulcinea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh, but how? How will you carry your warps out, Master Vain?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not ask that.—There lies my genius—I must manage it all myself—a genius must not be meddled with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but do you know old Brumma∣gem?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know him! a fellow full of lies and igno∣rance, who values you only for the number of quarters in your scutcheon, tells you long stories of
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>tables and chairs having been in his family for a hundred years, which, in reality, he bought second∣hand yesterday. It will be an absolute charity in you to deliver a poor girl from such a curmudgeon. And since you have engaged me in your service, you have nothing to fear. I'm sure to succeed. I wont praise myself,—but I'm so astonishingly clever—</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cheerly.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must at all events rescue this lovely girl. To lend a helping hand to those who are distress, is the character of our country, and British seamen have ever set the example.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, you are like the rest. Women are always making a dust in one part of the house or the other—Get out. <STAGE>(<HI>drives them off.</HI>)</STAGE> My master is a sad old hunks, to be sure. He hates the plain truth as I do physic, while he will swallow, chew, and digest a parcel of bouncing fibs by the hundred, as a man wou'd count walnuts. His house is like the fine speeches of fine gentry, all conterfeit; and the furniture in it would serve for the scenery of a harlequin farce; it tumbles to pieces the mo∣ment it is touched. But then these women prate so—Now they've hatched up a story about an iron cage—Shut up his niece indeed! What do they take him for? I do so hate women—I hate them all except my young mistress, because we were fostered together—I can't be expected to hate her—But I hate Selina, and I hate Dolly, tho' I never saw her before; and I hate—No, I don't hate
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Fanny—I wish I could—Well I think she'll have me: and when we're married, I dare say I shall hate her; for I know she will use me like a dog; but I cannot hate her for all that. Oh, Lord! here she comes! but I won't speak to her.</P>

<P>Psha! do not be nonsensical. Don't you see what an excellent match Captain Cheerly

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am thinking—that, if you and I should be married for love, we might chance to fight for victuals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but we'll be married for all that.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ralph. (discomposed, and turning his chair about)</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall we?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and you shall be so smart, you shall look like a captain. You know, as my young mistress's husband is an officer in the navy, when you and I marry, you may wear a cockade in your hat as well as any captain of them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wear a cockade! I am thinking, if you and I marry, <STAGE>(<HI>puts his hand to his forehead</HI>)</STAGE> if I shall be able to wear a hat. No, I'll never marry, I'm determin'd. I'll leave service rather than be made a fool of by the women.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum. (puts on his spectacles)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! let me hear all that sir Andrew says—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph. (reads)</SPEAKER>
<P>"A young man of this place"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is it dated? From Barcelona, Eh? <STAGE>(<HI>peering over letter</HI>).</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph. (aside)</SPEAKER>
<P>It is lucky that I happen to know that—Oh, from Barcelona, certainly.—But why need I read? I'll tell it you—A young man was desperate∣ly in love with a girl of good fortune; and the father denied his consent, and wanted to marry her against her inclinations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>More fool he. Well!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wherefore they laid a scheme to join the young people's hands, under the father's nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! and how did they manage it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>One day the old man comes home as usual, with a hat as large <STAGE>(<HI>takes Brum.'s hat from his head</HI>)</STAGE> aye, larger than yours, <STAGE>(<HI>puts the hat on the table, making signs occasionally as to some one without</HI>)</STAGE> and
<PB N="44" REF="42"/>seeing some strangers coming about the house, takes up his cane, that he always carried as you do, <STAGE>(<HI>takes cane from Brummagem's hand</HI>)</STAGE> This is a gold head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the purest gold of Spain. It was given to my grandfather, by the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, no matter: I thought as much. Well, he takes his cane, and runs to his coffers where he kept his money; for sir Andrew says he did not suspect the design on his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! a simpleton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite a fool! Now his money was all fast secured under two stout keys such as these; <STAGE>(<HI>takes the keys from Brummagem's girdle, dangles'em about, and lays them on the table</HI>)</STAGE> and forth he sets to beat the rogues from his coffers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, while he was busy at his coffers, a maid servant, coming behind his back, <STAGE>(<HI>Fanny enters unobserved by Brummagem—takes the keys off table, opens the door, which she leaves unlockt, lays the keys down again on the table.</HI>)</STAGE> takes the keys, goes to her young mistress's door, opens it, lets the young lady know that her lover was waiting in the next room with a clergyman to marry them before they left the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there was some decency in the young folks at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! sir Andrew says he was a most ex∣cellent young man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose, now, the father had happened to meet the maid on this errand <STAGE>(<HI>turning, sees Fanny,
<PB N="45" REF="43"/>who had just replaced the keys</HI>)</STAGE>—what do you want here, hussey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fanny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came to see if you would have the cho∣colate-cup taken away, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well—Ay, by all means. This is some of the finest china that— <STAGE>(Fanny carries out the cups)</STAGE> But I say, my dear friend, <STAGE>(<HI>replaces the keys in his girdle</HI>)</STAGE>suppose he had met the maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that would have been unlucky, to be sure—But, as it happen'd, he never suspected her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and so—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>The young lady was all in readiness to sly to her lover, but so overcome with fear, that she durst not venture to leave the room; upon which, her lover—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Cheerly, conducted by Fanny, crosses the stage unobserv'd by Brummagem, and both go into Laura's room)</STAGE>
<P>goes to her room to encourage— <STAGE>(<HI>aside</HI>)</STAGE> So far all is safe.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, oh, my dear friend, but what!—All this happen before the father's face!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Brummy: you misunderstand me. They went behind the father's back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, it is lucky the old gentleman didn't turn his head round. What a pretty kettle of fish there wou'd have been!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but then—Aye, very true—I had forgot to tell you one circumstance. This scheme was managed by a rogue of a servant who played the old fool the most ludicrous trick—I cannot help laughing when I think of it— <STAGE>(<HI>Brum. affects to laugh</HI>)</STAGE>
<PB N="46" REF="44"/>I'll shew you how they contriv'd it.</P>
<STAGE>(they turn to∣wards each other).</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means. It's a good story, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent! I'll shew you. Well, now, you shall suppose I am this rogue of a servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that you are the fool of a father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I take your large hat—such a one, we'll suppose, as this <STAGE>(<HI>takes Brum.'s hat from table</HI>)</STAGE> or larger, and I clap it entirely over your face. <STAGE>(<HI>ties a handkerchief over the hat</HI>)</STAGE> Now turn your head about, first on one side, then on the other side. What do you see?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, while I keep this hat close over your eyes, forth comes the whole procession—first the maid servant with a bundle of her mistress's cloaths;</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>Fanny comes out of Laura's room with a bun∣dle of cloaths, and exit. Cheerly and Laura following her</HI>).</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum. (trying to lift up the hat, or peep from it)</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the lover, supporting the poor frighten'd damsel;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>And lastly she herself, as anxious to escape as a prisoner for life from his prison, but trembling with fear lest her father should hear her; for if he had, you know— <STAGE>(<HI>Cheerly and Laura go off</HI>)</STAGE> Ha, ha, ha! You know—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha! <STAGE>(<HI>looking from behind the hat</HI>)</STAGE> Very true; I comprehend you—How their hearts must have leapt when they got clear off!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—and when their hands were in∣stantly joined by the clergyman in the next room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>A rare story indeed! And very rarely contrived! Not like poor captain Vain's, with his fool's coat, and his thousand years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; 'twas managed by a much cleverer fellow. You may take off the hat—the story's over.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>takes off the hat</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where did this happen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Devonshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brum.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Devonshire! Why, you said it was in Spain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ralph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, Devonshire in Spain.</P>

<P>Nay, you said yourself it was a good story; and I am sure it has answered a very good purpose—Ha, ha, ha!—</P>
