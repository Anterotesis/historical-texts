<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD VISCOUNT CHARLEMONT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is generally expected that there should be some rela∣tion between the character of the patron and the nature of the work, for which protection is solicited.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>BUT this law, like many others, is broken when it op∣poses the gratification of pas∣sions too strong for the re∣straints of regularity. Ambi∣tion, which often overpowers the judgment in questions of more importance, has made me forget the disproportion be∣tween Your Lordship's name, and a Dramatic Pastoral; and I have ventured to lay before You a composition of little dignity in the design, and per∣haps of little elegance in the execution.</P>
<P>YET for whatever we re∣solve, we labour to find reasons,
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
till in time we forget its impro∣priety; I begin to hope, that by offering to Your Lordship a performance of an airy and luxuriant kind, which can at best hope only for excuse, I expose myself less to the im∣putation of arrogance, than if I had prefixed Your name to a piece more grave and oftenta∣tious, which might have been suspected of pretending to ap∣probation.</P>
<P>I am, my Lord, far from imagining that any of my ideas can be new to Your extensive knowledge, or that I have at∣tained any beauties of style or
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
sentiment adequate to Your delicacy of taste. The merit of this Poem is but small in my own opinion, and yet, of the lit∣tle praise which it may receive, I must resign a part, by confes∣sing that the first hint was taken from the PASTOR FIDO, and that the two songs marked with asterisks <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See page 11, and 24.</NOTE>, were written by another hand.</P>
<P>WHATEVER praise this con∣fession may detract from my abilities, it will add to my sin∣cerity; and I should discover little knowledge of Your Lord∣ship, if I should endeavour to
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
recommend myself, rather by elevation of genius than by pu∣rity of manners.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, with great respect, MY LORD, Your Lordship's Most obliged Humble servant, CHARLOTTE LENNOX.</SIGNED>
