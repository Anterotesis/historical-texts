<HEAD>THE HACKNEY COACHMAN; OR, The Way to get a good Fare.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>I AM a bold Coachman and drive a good Hack,</L>
<L>With a coat of five capes that quite covers my back;</L>
<L>And my wife keeps a sausage-shop not many miles</L>
<L>From the narrowest alley in all Broad St. Giles.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Tho' poor we are honest and very content,</L>
<L>We pay as we go for meat, drink, and for rent;</L>
<L>To work all the week I am able and willing,</L>
<L>I never get drunk, and I waste not a shilling.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>What tho' at a tavern my gentleman tarries,</L>
<L>Why the coachman grows richer than he whom he carries;</L>
<L>And I'd rather (say I) since it saves me from sin,</L>
<L>Be the Driver without than the Toper within.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>For the dram-shop I hate and the dram-drinking friend,</L>
<L>Yet I'm not quite so good but I wish I may mend;</L>
<L>I repent of my sins since we all are deprav'd,</L>
<L>For a Coachman, I hold, has a soul to be sav'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>When a riotous multitude fills up a street,</L>
<L>And the greater part know not, boys, wherefore they meet;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
If I see there is mischief I never go there,</L>
<L>Let others get tipsy, so I get my fare.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Now to church if I take some good lady to pray,</L>
<L>It grieves me full sore to be kept quite away;</L>
<L>So I step thro' the door-way, for here 'tis the sin,</L>
<L>To loiter without when one might enter in.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Then my glasses are whole, and my coach is so neat,</L>
<L>I am always the first to be call'd in the street;</L>
<L>And I'm known by the name ('tis a name rather rare)</L>
<L>Of the Coachman that never asks more than his fare.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' my beasts should be dull yet I don't use them ill;</L>
<L>Tho' they stumble I swear not, nor cut them up hill;</L>
<L>For I firmly believe there's no charm in an oath</L>
<L>That can make a Nag trot when to walk he is loth.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>And tho' I'm a Coachman, I'll freely confess,</L>
<L>I beg of my Maker my labors to bless;</L>
<L>I praise him each morning, and pray every night,</L>
<L>And 'tis this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>When I drive to a Fun'ral I care not for drink,</L>
<L>That is not the moment to guzzle, but think;</L>
<L>And I wish I cou'd add both of Coachman and Master,</L>
<L>That both of us strove to amend a bit faster.</L>
