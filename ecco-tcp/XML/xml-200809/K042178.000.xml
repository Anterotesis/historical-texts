<HEAD>THE PASQUINADE. BOOK the FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>Pasquinade.</HI>] As it is highly necessary that every writer, who publishes his works for the instruction and emolument of the publick, should write in such a manner as to be understood by those of a common capacity, as well as by those, who, as the poet says, <Q><L>— Peruse a work of wit</L><L>With the same spirit that its author writ;</L></Q> Or, if he does not, as it is highly becoming the scholiast to make them familiar to such readers, I should think myself very unworthy to illustrate the following poem, did I pass over the <HI>name</HI> itself; which, tho' some Critics may understand, I am persuaded many do not.—Know then, that <HI>Pasquin</HI> was <HI>Cobler,</HI> who work'd in his stall at <HI>Rome,</HI> about the beginning of the fifteenth Century; and, being a fellow of ready wit and a satyrical disposition, the people flock'd about him to hear him rally and talk politics, at which he was very expert. After his decease, the statue of a Gladiator being dug up near his stall, it was set up and call'd <HI>Pasquin</HI>; the <HI>wits,</HI> his pupils, taking it in their heads, in ho∣nour to their <HI>dead</HI> master, to stick their lampoons, satires and libels thereon; all which were termed <HI>Pasquinades.</HI> If thou doubtest, reader, whether this poem was ever hung on the said statue, if thou take a walk to a certain corner of the palace of <HI>Ursines</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> thou may'st enquire further concerning it.</NOTE>O Chief in verse! O ev'ry Muses' care!<NOTE PLACE="foot">Line 1. <HI>O chief in verse.</HI>] The great personage here addressed, from what we may gather from the following lines, can be no other than Dr. <HI>John Hill, Acad. Rege Scient. Burd.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Soc.</HI> and <HI>Inspector General</HI> of Great Britain.</NOTE></L>

<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>Whether enraptur'd with <HI>Urania</HI>'s charms,<NOTE PLACE="foot">Lines 3, 4. <HI>Whether enraptur'd, &amp;c.</HI>] These lines seem to hint at the amours of Mr. <HI>Inspector,</HI> who has so often celebrated, in his works, his <HI>Chloes, Daphnes,</HI> and <HI>Amandas,</HI> all Ladies of quality, whose favours, some have been bold enough to say, have been of the same nature with those he received from the Muses; purely imaginary; but we pre∣sume not to assert this opinion, 'till we have some authority to suppose those Ladies as chaste as the Sisters of <HI>Parnassus.</HI></NOTE></L>

<L>Or, in Philosophy profoundly wise,</L>
<L>You pore intent with microscopic eyes,<MILESTONE N="10"/><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 10. <HI>You pore intent with microscopic eyes.</HI>] From the contradiction this passage seems to imply to that of another great author and philosopher, who says, <Q>Why has not Man a microscopic Eye?</Q></P><P>It might possibly be concluded that some mistake had happened, either in transcribing or printing this line; and that our author intended it, <HI>thro' microscopic eyes,</HI> meaning the eyes, or the glasses of his Microscope: But, if any credit may be given to this Gentle∣man's discoveries in natural philosophy, we must conclude he himself is possess'd of eyes infinitely more discerning than the rest of the Virtuosi; having found out such animal∣culae, and their method of existence, as no other Philosopher ever did, or ever will, tho' assisted by all the helps of the most improved Microscope, unless possess'd of the same kind of eyes: The visual rays to which are so ductile, that they not only are directed from real objects, but from <HI>no</HI> objects at all, —which accomplishment alone should suffi∣ciently establish this great man as the prince of Philosophers, and empower him to correct and censure the researches of others: As we must own the eye that can <HI>see</HI> what is <HI>in∣visible,</HI> is certainly more able to explore the secrets of nature than that which can see only <HI>what is to be seen.</HI> —I find no reason therefore to vary the reading in the text.</P></NOTE></L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>New worlds discover in a <HI>Catharine pear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 11. <HI>New worlds discover in a Catharine pear.</HI>] Among the philosophic researches hinted in the preceding annotation, take the following, made by this Gentleman on a rotten pear.—</P><Q>It was but a very small portion of the covered furface of the pear that could be brought within the area of the Microscope, but this appeared, under its influence, a wide extent of territory; varied with hills and lawns, with winding hollows, open plains, and shadowy thickets. <BIBL>INSPECTOR.</BIBL></Q><P>A very material objection indeed arises against our author, in respect that he calls it a <HI>Catharine Pear</HI>; as this philosopher in his preamble to the experiment, expressly says, it was a <HI>French</HI> Pear, in which we cannot think him mistaken, as he took such particu∣lar notice of the said pear; for, says he, it was cut by a person very fond of Pears, who out of that excessive fondness eat a thin slice, and reserved the rest to another op∣portunity: That he cried <HI>Pah!</HI> at seeing it again when rotten, and that it was cut at the largest end.—<HI>Vide Inspector</HI> 332. So that from these circumstances we must re∣mark this as an error in our author.</P></NOTE></L>
<L>Or monsters animate in sour small beer,</L>
<L>Serenely trace their <HI>fundamental breath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 13. <HI>Fundamental breath.</HI>] Alluding to an animal, which this profound enquirer into nature discover'd, whose organs of respiration are situated in its fundament; and which continually swims with its head under water, and its tail above, for fear of be∣ing drown'd. A very singular kind of creature it must be own'd; and it is presum'd a very clean one: As to no other part of its body are assign'd the offices which we should readily suppose were those of the part mentioned. <HI>Vide Inspector,</HI> 393.</P><P>In this passage our author, like other great writers, it must be confess'd, doth not pay the strictest regard to historical truth: As the monster, here spoken of, is not said to be engender'd in <HI>small beer</HI>; but was the polite inhabitant of <HI>Kensington.</HI></P></NOTE></L>
<L>Whilst thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death:<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 14. <HI>Whilst thy grim Lion grinds thy foes to death.</HI>] Our author seems here to have an eye to a very curious piece of history, in the <HI>London Daily Advertiser,</HI> of <HI>Ja∣nuary</HI> 8, 1752, which runs thus:</P><Q>We hear from the <HI>Bedford Coffee-House</HI> in <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> that an unhappy Gen∣tleman of that neighbourhood, having yesterday morning in wantonness, thrust his head into the mouth of the Lion that resides there, felt the jaws unexpectedly close up∣on him: On this, enquiring with a hollow voice, whether he shook his tail, and being answered in the affirmative, he begged the by-standers to pray for him. A ter∣rible crash was immediately after heard, and notwithstanding the uncommon resis∣stance of the skull, it is credibly reported, that the teeth met through it. He was im∣mediately after conveyed home, but his Surgeons are afraid the wounds will prove mortal. <BIBL>Dr. HILL.</BIBL></Q><P>It is not material to consider how much <HI>wit</HI> or <HI>truth</HI> is in this paragraph, if it serves to give the public a great idea of the said Lion.</P></NOTE></L>

<L>Blest in thy own <HI>inspectatorial</HI> stile,<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 17. <HI>Inspectatorial stile.</HI>] A manner of writing peculiar to this great man, which has so often been imitated by the superficial writers of the present age; and which our author seems to speak of as inimitable. The reader, if any such there be, who is unacquainted with this stile, will conceive some idea of it from the following specimens. —Speaking of a little rivulet or ditch, he says;</P><Q>The translucent waves coursed one another down the light declivity, with an inexpressibly pleasing variety of form, and a confused but very soft noise of bubbling, lashing, and murmuring, <HI>among, against,</HI> and <HI>along</HI> the inequalities and meanders of its rough sides, and various hollows.</Q><P>Of a pond, he says,—<Q>The surface of the bason was a polished plane, unfurrow∣ed by the least motion, unruffled by the gentlest breeze; the setting sun threw a glow of pale splendor over one half of it, the rest was silent shade</Q>.</P><P>On weeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> gather'd to one corner of a ditch. — <Q>The fresh breeze had blown together into this part of the watery expanse, whatever floated <HI>on or near</HI> its surface</Q>. — How philosophically exact <HI>among, against,</HI> and <HI>along.—on or near.</HI> At the same time how poetical and florid! <HI>Translucent waves, Meanders, gentlest breeze, the glow of splendor</HI> and <HI>expanse.</HI> Hence reader, if thou hast perchance seen only the faint imi∣tations of this beautiful stile, thou may'st conceive a more correct idea of what our au∣thor here so pathetically laments the want of. Vide <HI>Inspectors</HI> 311, 393, 429.</P></NOTE></L>

This expression being evidently taken from the motto on the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>'s Coach. <HI>Pennâ metuente solvi. Vide</HI> State Coach of Sir <HI>Crisp Gascoine:</HI> Also <HI>Horace</HI>'s Ode to <HI>Crisp. Sallust.</HI></NOTE></L>

<L>Of Bards that live, and Bards that write for life;<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 38. <HI>Of Bards that live and Bards that write for life.</HI>] I am appriz'd that this line may be taken in a varied sense. —Some may imagine, that by a man's <HI>writing for life</HI> is intended his writing for a <HI>livelihood</HI>; and that by Bards that <HI>live</HI> are meant those who live <HI>independent</HI> of writing; as it is expressed by this line.</P><Q>These live to write, and those must write to live.</Q><P>A kind of distinction which seems to have been handed down from that immortal Philosopher, Lord Chancellor <HI>Bacon</HI>; who is said to have complained to King <HI>James</HI> the First, lest he should be reduced to <HI>study</HI> to <HI>live,</HI> rather than <HI>live</HI> to <HI>study.</HI> I cannot however think this our author's drift; but that by <HI>writing for life,</HI> he meant, <HI>writing as hard as one can drive,</HI> and that he had in his eye, that part of the old ballad of the <HI>Wife of Bath,</HI> <Q><L>When <HI>Adam</HI> heard her say these words,</L><L>He ran away for Life.</L></Q> In which case, as <HI>Adam,</HI> according to the tradition, is in Paradise, or Heaven, he could not be supposed to run to preserve his life; so that it is clear our author intended only to convey the eagerness of the pursuit of those Bards, who, had the measure allow'd, he might have said, <Q>Write <HI>AWAY</HI> for Life.</Q></P></NOTE></L>

<L>Physicians, Parsons, Fools, and dancing Bears.<MILESTONE N="40"/><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Line 40. <HI>Dancing Bears.</HI>] The reader is not to take this expression literally, or think the poet celebrates real, <HI>four legg'd Bears</HI>; or that he had any view to the famous <HI>Ursi domestici mirabili,</HI> that yielded the <HI>Inspector</HI> an opportunity of being so very witty last summer, or to those gentle Bruins that now expose themselves by dancing horn∣pipes in the streets. It is plain he intends no more by the word <HI>Bear,</HI> than as Sir ALEXANDER DRAWCANSIR has defin'd that appellation, in his compleat Modern Glossary.</P><Q>Bear,—a Country Gentleman, or any creature on <HI>TWO</HI> legs that does not make a good bow. <BIBL><HI>COVENT-GARDEN JOURNAL, No. 4.</HI></BIBL></Q><P>Neither doth our author proceed only on <HI>precedent,</HI> having also philosophical au∣thority.

He establishes in that work one of his Genera, under the name of <HI>Anthropomorphae,</HI> that is, creatures having the hu∣man form, and comprehends under it the <HI>Bear,</HI> the <HI>Man,</HI> and the <HI>Monkey.</HI> <BIBL>HILL.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></L>
