<P>FALDONI AND TERESA.</P>

<Q>IS IT IN HEAV'N A CRIME TO LOVE TOO WELL?

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following poem is founded on a very singular Event that happened near Lyons in the month of June 1770—Two Lovers (FALDONI and TERESA MEUNIER) meeting with an invincible obstacle to their union, determined to put an end to their existence with pistols. The place they chose for the execution of their terrible project was a chapel that stood at a little distance from the house. They even decorated the altar for the occasion: they also paid a particular attention to their own dress: TERESA was dressed in white, with rose-coloured Ribbands: The same coloured Ribbands were tied to the pistols. Each held the Ribband that was fastened to the other's trigger, which they drew at a signal agreed upon.</P>
<Q>Arria and Paetus (says Monsieur de Voltaire) set the example, but then it must be considered they were condemned to death by a tyrant, whereas love was the only inventor and perpetrator of the deed we have recorded—See <HI>Questions sur L'Encyclopedie, Articles De caton et de suicide</HI>—See also a book entitled <HI>Les Tableaux</HI> by the Marquis de Pezai.</Q>

<HEAD>FALDONI AND TERESA,</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TO you, ye sons of France, the Muse appeals,</L>
<L>To vouch the truth of what she now reveals:</L>
<L>Say, have ye not beheld what love can dare,</L>
<L>When torn with grief, and prompted by despair.</L>
<L>Still urg'd by pity ye bewail their doom,<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>Still to the traveller ye mark the tomb,</L>
<L>Where sleep, from tyrant laws, and sorrows free,</L>
<L>The youthful victims of their own decree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All-ruling Love, the God of Youth, possess'd</L>
<L>Entire dominion of FALDONI's breast:<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>An equal flame did sympathy impart,</L>
<L>(A flame destructive) to TERESA's heart:</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>As on one stem two opening flowers respire,</L>
<L>So grew their life (entwin'd) on one desire:</L>
<L>Yet lest their hopes parental power should blast,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Still o'er their love her veil Concealment cast:</L>
<L>Near to the mansion, on a secret spot,</L>
<L>(Meet haunt for lovers) rose a sylvan grot:</L>
<L>True to the stated moment still they came,</L>
<L>Here breath'd the vow, here fed the mutual flame; <MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Here form'd to list'ning Heaven the firm resolve,</L>
<L>Which power, nor fate averse, shou'd e'er dissolve:</L>
<L>This grot the confident of ev'ry fear,</L>
<L>This kind recess that bosom'd ev'ry tear,</L>
<L>Where oft the impassion'd soul they did assuage,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Urg'd by a warmth congenial to their age,</L>
<L>Still they devoted to the pow'r above,</L>
<L>And fondly call'd the Temple of their Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once as they hasten'd to this still retreat,</L>
<L>The mutual object of their wish to meet,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>FALDONI saw the beauteous maid distress'd,</L>
<L>Her cheek with terror and alarm imprest:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Saw rais'd to Heav'n her supplicating eyes,</L>
<L>As if to deprecate the vengeful skies:</L>
<L>'Ah speak (he cried) with anxious wonder fraught,<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>'What undivided care employs thy thought?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In accents suited to the strain of woe,</L>
<L>TERESA thus indulg'd her thoughts to flow:</L>
<L>'The cloud, which long has threaten'd to destroy,</L>
<L>'With rage redoubled bursts upon our joy:<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>'Ev'n thro' the friendly veil Concealment wove,</L>
<L>'There are who mark'd the progress of our love:</L>
<L>'To pity dead, and Nature's stronger claim,</L>
<L>'A father—Whence does he usurp that name?</L>
<L>'Ah had thine eyes beheld the cruel scene,<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>'As with indignant and tremendous mien,</L>
<L>'While to his mercy kneeling I applied,</L>
<L>'With barb'rous hand he flung me from his side,</L>
<L>'And bad me—Oh insensible of heart!</L>
<L>'Far from his angry presence to depart,<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>'Unless—Can I pronounce his dread demand?</L>
<L>'I wou'd from thee withdraw this plighted hand:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>'Behold me banish'd from my native home,</L>
<L>'To thee a hapless fugitive I come,</L>
<L>'Bent to the ground beneath Misfortune's show'r,<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>'Affliction's bride, a father's curse my dow'r:</L>
<L>'Yet why complain! still happy in thy love,</L>
<L>'What more can earth bestow, or Heaven above?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'For this are daughters born, (FALDONI cried)</L>
<L>'To fall the victims of parental pride!<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>'When nature, youth, and sympathy unite,</L>
<L>'Say, shall a father's voice forbid the rite?</L>
<L>'Shall he, with cruel and relentless hands,</L>
<L>'O'erthrow the altar? tear the nuptial bands?</L>
<L>'But thou with love and virtue shall combine,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>'To break the law that bids thee not be mine:</L>
<L>'Still shall the lov'd TERESA be my bride:</L>
<L>'Not Fortune's gifts to which thou art allied,</L>
<L>'In my attachment claim'd their venal part,</L>
<L>'I fought what love requires, a tender heart:<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>'Tho' wreck'd, despoil'd, of Fortune's golden store,</L>
<L>'Rich only in thy heart, I prize thee more.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>'With me ascend yon Alpinean height,</L>

<L>'In some kind breast compassion may prevail!</L>
<L>'In vain—for busy apprehension still</L>
<L>'Alarms my love, and traverses my will:</L>
<L>'Worn with the labours of the length'ning way,</L>
<L>'Should'st thou sink down to weariness a prey:<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L>'If in that moment, by thy father led,</L>

<L>'If, as the coward numbers shou'd prevail,</L>
<L>'(Thou most ador'd, thou blest with every charm)<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>'They still shou'd tear thee from this vanquish'd arm,</L>
<L>'Not all their cruelty (the fair rejoin'd)</L>
<L>'Shall ever boast a conquest o'er my mind,</L>
<L>'Ne'er shall they wrest this heart, still uncontrol'd,</L>
<L>'From Constancy's embrace, and Passion's hold:<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>'If to the law that bids me not be thine,</L>

<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>'To rescue still my soul from that distress,</L>

<L>'Be bolder still, and let my voice decide:</L>

<L>'Ah rather meet inevitable fate!</L>
<L>'Let us, since life, with foul and haggard mien,</L>
<L>'Holds to our wishes but a desert scene,</L>
<L>'To Death's dread region urge our daring way,</L>
<L>'And quit the aspect of the living day.<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'I give (she cry'd) this breast, 'tis thine, to bleed,</L>
<L>'Ah more than give, I glory in the deed:</L>
<L>'Unfold the means—the instruments prepare—</L>
<L>'All, all that daring Love can do, I dare.</L>

<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
<L>The youth rejoin'd: 'When o'er the silent world <MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>'The hand of Darkness has her veil unfurl'd:</L>
<L>'When thro' her mid career the Night has run,</L>
<L>'Shall, warranted by Love, a deed be done,</L>

<L>'Thro' the long page of love-created woe:<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>'The sacred wall of this sequester'd spot,</L>

<L>Prepar'd to act the counsel of despair.</L>
<L>With eager arms he strain'd her to his breast,</L>

<L>'See rear'd by me yon sacred altar stands,</L>
<L>'Adorn'd with lights, and dress'd with flow'ry bands:<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>'See near the cross (in silken chains array'd)</L>
<L>'The ready instruments of Death display'd:</L>
<L>'Nor pale regret, nor doubt, the coward's train,</L>

<L><PB N="12" REF="14"/>'The darken'd air sent forth a voice unknown,</L>

<L>'From whence they sprung, these spectres of the mind:</L>

<L>'And beautify the purpose of our soul:</L>

<L>He spoke—when guided by a rage divine,</L>
<L>Th'enthusiast led her to the sacred shrine:<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="15"/>Then, as their bended knee the ground impress'd,</L>
<L>He thus aloud the throne of grace address'd:</L>
<L>'Thou who did'st form our mutual hearts to glow,</L>
<L>'With all the feelings that the tender know,</L>
<L>'Behold us by a parent's voice with-held,<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>'From rites connubial, and from joy expell'd:</L>

<LG>
<L>Now, on the fair, FALDONI cast his eye,</L>
<L>While half-suppress'd arose compassion's sigh:</L>

<L>'And shun the fate that iron-hearts impose:</L>
<L>'Yet, when I think, if stern parental pow'r <MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>'Had to our wishes giv'n the nuptial hour,</L>
<L>'Life might have wing'd its way supremely blest,</L>
