<L>IF in these days of luxury and case,</L>
<L>A tale from Sparta's rigid state can please;</L>
<L>If patriot plans a British breast can warm;</L>
<L>If Kings asserting liberty can charm;</L>
<L>If Virtue still a grateful aspect wear;</L>
<L>Check not at Agis' fall the gen'rous tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He view'd his subjects with a parent's love;</L>
<L>With zeal to save a sinking people strove;</L>
<L>Strove their chang'd hearts with glory to inflame;</L>
<L>To mend their Morals; and restore their name:</L>
<L>Till Faction rose with Murder at her side;</L>
<L>Then mourn'd his country; persever'd; and died.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That country once for virtue was rever'd;</L>
<L>Admir'd by Greece; by haughty Asia fear'd.</L>
<L>Then Citizens and Soldiers were the same;</L>
<L>And soldiers heroes; for their wealth was fame.</L>
<L>Then for the Brave the Fair reserv'd her charms;</L>
<L>And scorn'd to clasp a toward in her arms.</L>
<L>The trumpet call'd; she seiz'd the sword and shield;</L>
<L>Array'd in haste her husband for the field;</L>
<L>And sighing whisper'd in a fond embrace,</L>
<L>"Remember!—death is better than disgrace.</L>
<L>The widow'd Mother shew'd her parting son</L>
<L>The race of glory which his sire had run.</L>
<L>"My son, thy fight alone I shall deplore.</L>
<L>"Return victorious!—or return no more!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While Beauty thus with patriot zeal combin'd,</L>
<L>And round the laurel'd head her myrtle twin'd;</L>
<L>Whilst all confest the Virtuous were the Great;</L>
<L>Fame, Valor, Conquest, grac'd the Spartan state.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>
Her Pow'r congenial with her Virtue grew,</L>
<L>And freedom's Banner o'er her Phalanx flew;</L>
<L>But soon as Virtue dropt her sick'ning head,</L>
<L>Fame, Valor, Conquest, Pow'r and Freedom fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May this sad scene improve each Briton's heart!</L>
<L>Rouse him with warmth to act a Briton's part!</L>
<L>Prompt him with Sparta's noblest sons to vie;</L>
<L>To live in glory; and in freedom die!</L>

<L>The adverse fortune of an exil'd king</L>
<L>Pursues my lord. Achaia's generous aid</L>
<L>Sustains his cause in vain. Why risk a battle,</L>
<L>When the continuance of defensive war</L>
<L>Secur'd success and victory in Sparta?</L>
<L>Would I had never left thy splendid court,</L>
<L>Delightful Sardis! to be Sparta's queen.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> AMPHARES.</STAGE>
<L>Welcome, AMPHARES! Have the armies met?</L>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>They have. This morning, at the break of day,</L>
<L>The Spartan army charged Achaia's host.</L>
<L>This and no more is known. Suspense and fear</L>
<L>Possess the people; to the gates they run,</L>
<L>Then to their houses: the still whisper spreads</L>
<L>Thro' justling multitudes the dread alarm.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas! revenge and empire now depend</L>
<L>On the wild issue of unruly war.</L>
<L>What if the arms of AGIS should prevail?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Although he should, the toils of fate surround him.</L>
<L>Dauntless and firm our brave associates stand,</L>
<L>And with impatience wait the destin'd hour</L>
<L>To rush on AGIS. This unlook'd-for battle</L>
<L>Is but a solemn prelude to the act,</L>
<L>Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.</L>
<L>This day shall terminate the reign of AGIS,</L>
<L>And make, O Queen! all power in Sparta thine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I see that danger only whets the brave.</L>
<L>But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanquish'd,</L>
<L>Will not the conquering army awe the city?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>AGIS shall be the surety of our cause,</L>
<L>And hostage for our safety, till we wrest</L>
<L>The sword from proud LYSANDER, if he conquers;</L>
<L>But that I fear not much. New to command</L>
<L>From idle Athens the mock hero comes,</L>
<L>Starts up a soldier, and a statesman too;</L>
<L>Each palm he claims: All honours must adorn</L>
<L>The chosen friend of visionary AGIS.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>May Mars direct him so to guide the war,</L>
<L>As AGIS rules the state: And mutiny</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>This factious state must change its feeble form,</L>
<L>Waver no more beneath a double reign</L>
<L>Of limited, contending, useless kings.</L>
<L>Henceforth our monarch shall in Sparta rule,</L>
<L>As Jove alone in high Olympus reigns.</L>

<SPEAKER>SANDANE.</SPEAKER>

<L>And such imperial power, I thought, belong'd</L>
<L>To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.</L>
<L>Young, and deceiv'd, I left my father's court</L>
<L>For Lacedaemon's miserable sceptre.</L>
<L>I did endeavour to extend its sway,</L>
<L>And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.</L>
<L>But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,</L>
<L>Unprincely AGIS, marr'd the brave design.</L>
<L>Chief of the multitude, idol and slave</L>
<L>Of the base populace, he led the herd,</L>
<L>He urged their brutal fury on the king.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>And now their fury on himself recoils.</L>
<L>Like the unruly elephant, they turn,</L>
<L>And trample down the ranks in which they fought.</L>

<SPEAKER>SANDANE.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is their Liberty.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let us employ,</L>
<L>And then suppress, such formidable licence.</L>
<L>My magistracy now is near expir'd;</L>
<L>A king's resentment and a rival's hate</L>
<L>Have long hung over my devoted head:</L>
<L>Farewel to place, to dignity, and power,</L>
<L>Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne.</L>
<L>I will not live obscure in Lacedaemon,</L>
<L>Nor roam thro' Grecian states a banish'd man.</L>

<L>I know thy merits, and I will reward them.</L>
<L>Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,</L>
<L>Prime mover and inflamer of sedition?</L>
<L>Hast thou not bent the power of thy high office</L>
<L>To the subversion of the state thou serv'st?</L>

<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>What has dishonour'd thee?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou and thy practices, they have compell'd me</L>
<L>To leave the noblest station of a prince.</L>
<L>In time of war where should a king be found</L>
<L>But at his army's head? There AGIS stood,</L>
<L>When you and your presumptuous Ephori</L>
<L>Required my presence here. Ungrateful Spartans!</L>
<L>Had you allow'd me but one other day,</L>
<L>Then had I fought this battle for my country,</L>
<L>And died or conquer'd with her bravest sons.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGESISTRATA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Peril, my son! dwells not in camps alone:</L>
<L>In cities, palaces, and courts of justice,</L>
<L>With treachery and treason she inhabits.</L>
<L>Peril attended thus thou must encounter,</L>
<L>More hideous sure than in the ranks of war.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know my actions have incens'd the king</L>
<L>But I imagin'd not that such suspicions</L>
<L>Found entertainment in your royal breasts?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hast thou not join'd the enemies of AGIS?</L>
<L>Thou who wast once his friend, inconstant man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe,</L>
<L>Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou hast oppos'd LYCURGUS and the laws,</L>
<L>Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the skies.</L>
<L>The Delphic God inspir'd the deep design:</L>
<L>For more than human was that power of thought</L>
<L>Which join'd the public to the private good,</L>
<L>With such perfection, that each selfish passion</L>
<L>Flow'd in the channel of the common welfare,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="10"/>
And, like one family of sons and sires,</L>
<L>And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.</L>
<L>In peace they liv'd without or strife or scorn,</L>
<L>In war they fought to conquer, or to die.</L>
<L>Equal and free, our happy fathers knew</L>
<L>No interest but the interest of the state;</L>
<L>No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore</L>
<L>That palm aloft, and shar'd the high respect,</L>
<L>The admiration, which consenting Greece</L>
<L>Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Revolving time that system overthrew,</L>
<L>And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>The laws have been neglected, not annull'd,</L>
<L>And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners.</L>
<L>Authority will soon revive the laws,</L>
<L>And great example yet restore the manners,</L>
<L>In spite of those who have oppress'd their country,</L>
<L>Depriv'd the people of their antient rights,</L>
<L>And while the nation sunk beneath their sway,</L>
<L>Still strove for power in a declining kingdom,</L>
<L>Still sought for wealth in an impoverish'd land.</L>
<L>Even at this hour rapacious they persist,</L>
<L>And, like some wretches in a stranded vessel,</L>
<L>Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mov'd by the present perils of the state,</L>
<L>This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet</L>
<L>The fortune of the field, to change my conduct,</L>
<L>And make an offer of my aid to AGIS.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>If I should judge the future by the past,</L>
<L>Thou must forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.</L>

<L>He who assistance offers is a friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>This hour may yet deceive their country's foes.</L>
<L>I know the base foundation of that hope</L>
<L>Which makes my baffled enemies presume.</L>
<L>LYSANDER's army in its ranks contains</L>
<L>The best and bravest of Laconia's sons;</L>
<L>The faction wish and hope defeat to them,</L>
<L>That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return</L>
<L>To guard that freedom which has made them brave.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove</L>
<L>In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGESISTRATA.</SPEAKER>
<L>AMPHARES, say, what is their utmost aim?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AMPHARES.</SPEAKER>
<L>The old dependants of the exil'd king,</L>
<L>And all the venal members of the state,</L>
<L>Won by SANDANE's arts and foreign gold,</L>
<L>Aim to restore LEONIDAS, who comes</L>
<L>With hostile armies to enslave his country:</L>
<L>Therefore SANDANE's proffers I rejected,</L>
<L>Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd him too;</L>
<L>But since resentment and distrust prevent me,</L>
<L>Neutral I stand, and will not seek that welcome</L>
<L>Which his more artful enemies would give.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AGIS.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou speak'st more boldly than becomes AMPHARES.</L>
<L>Add that to the offences I forgive.</L>
<L>It is the sacred maxim of my reign,</L>
<L>That in a prince's consecrated breast</L>
<L>Revenge and anger should not long remain.</L>
<L>These passions in a king afflict the state,</L>
<L>By driving rash offenders to despair.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. PRITCHARD.</BYLINE>
<L>A King in bloom of youth, for freedom die!</L>
<L>Our bard, tho' bold, durst not have soar'd so high.</L>
<L>This is no credulous admiring age;</L>
<L>But sacred sure the faith of Plutarch's page.</L>
<L>In simple stile that antient sage relates</L>
<L>The tale of Sparta, chief of Grecian states:</L>
<L>Eight hundred years it flourish'd, great in arms,</L>
<L>On dangers rose, and grow amidst alarms.</L>
<L>Of Sparta's triumph you have heard the cause,</L>
<L>More strong, more noble than Lycurgus' laws:</L>
<L>How Spartan Dames, by glory's charms inspir'd,</L>
<L>The son, the lover, and the husband fir'd.</L>
<L>Ye Fair of Britain's isle, which justly claims</L>
<L>The Grecian title, land of lovely dames,</L>
<L>In Britain's cause exert your matchless charms,</L>
<L>And rouse your lovers to the love of arms.</L>
<L>Hid, not extinct, the spark of valour lies;</L>
<L>Your breath shall raise it f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aming to the skies.</L>
<L>Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in air,</L>
<L>And bids Britannia's s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns for war prepare.</L>
<L>Let each lov'd maid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach mother bring the shield,</L>
<L>And arm their country's champions for the field.</L>
<L>Arm'd and inflam'd each British breast shall burn,</L>
<L>No youth unlaurel'd shall to you return.</L>
<L>Then shall we cease t'exult at trophies won,</L>
<L>In glory's field, by Heroes—not our own.</L>
<L>France yet shall tremble at the British sword,</L>
<L>And dread the Vengeance of her antient Lord.</L>
