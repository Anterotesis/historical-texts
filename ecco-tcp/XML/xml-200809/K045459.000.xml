<SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received both your favours—The Muse alone must tell my joy.</P>
<L>O'ER WHELM'D with pleasure at the joyful news,</L>
<L>I strung the chorded shell, and woke the Muse.</L>
<L>Begin, O Servant of the Sacred Nine!</L>
<L>And echo joy through ev'ry nervous line:</L>
<L>Bring down th' etherial Choir to aid the Song;</L>
<L>Let boundless raptures smoothly glide along.</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="7"/>
My Baker's well!—Oh words of sweet delight!</L>
<L>Now! now! my Muse, soar up th' Olympic height.</L>
<L>What wond'rous numbers can the Goddess find,</L>
<L>To paint th' extatic raptures of my mind?</L>
<L>I leave it to a Goddess more divine,</L>
<L>The beauteous H—l—d shall employ my line.</L>

<HEAD>TO THE BEAUTEOUS MISS H—L—D.</HEAD>
<L>FAR distant from Brittannia's lofty Isle,</L>
<L>What shall I find to make the Genius smile?</L>
<L>The bubbling fountains lose the power to please,</L>
<L>The rocky cataracts, the shady trees,</L>
<L>The juicy fruitage of enchanting hue,</L>
<L>Whose luscious virtues England never knew;</L>
<L>The variegated Daughters of the Land,</L>
<L>Whose numbers Flora strows with bounteous hand;</L>
<L>The verdant vesture of the smiling fields,</L>
<L>All the rich pleasures Nature's store-house yields,</L>
<L>Have all their powers to wake the chorded string:</L>
<L>But still they're subjects that the Muse can sing.</L>
<L>H—l—d more beauteous than the God of Day,</L>
<L>Her name can quicken and awake the Lay;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="9"/>
Rouse the soft Muse, from indolence and ease;</L>
<L>To live, to love, and rouse her powers to please.</L>
<L>In vain would Phoebus, did not H—l—d rise:</L>
<L>'Tis her bright eyes that gilds the Eastern skies;</L>
<L>'Tis she alone deprives us of the light;</L>
<L>And when she slumbers, then indeed 'tis night.</L>
<L>To tell the sep'rate beauties of her 'face</L>
<L>Would stretch Eternity's remotest space,</L>
<L>And want a more than man, to pen the line;</L>
<L>I rest; let this suffice, dear H—l—d's all divine.</L>

<L>AMIDST the wild and dreary dells,</L>
<L>The distant echo-giving bells,</L>
<L>The bending mountains head;</L>
<L>Whilst Ev'ning, moving thro' the sky,</L>
<L>Over the object and the eye,</L>
<L>Her pitchy robes doth spread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There gently moving thro' the vale,</L>
<L>Bending before the blust'ring gale,</L>
<L>Fell apparitions glide;</L>
<L>Whilst roaring rivers echo round,</L>
<L>The drear reverberating sound</L>
<L>Runs thro' the mountain side:</L>

<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<L>Then steal I softly to the grove,</L>
<L>And singing of the Nymph I love,</L>
<L>Sigh out my sad complaint;</L>
<L>To paint the tortures of my mind,</L>
<L>Where can the Muses numbers find?</L>
<L>Ah! numbers are too faint!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah! H—l—d, Empress of my heart,</L>
<L>When will thy breast admit the dart,</L>
<L>And own a mutual flame?</L>
<L>When, wand'ring in the myrtle groves,</L>
<L>Shall mutual pleasures seal our loves;</L>
<L>Pleasures without a name?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou greatest beauty of the sex,</L>
<L>When will the little God perplex</L>
<L>The mansions of thy breast?</L>
<L>When wilt thou own a flame as pure,</L>
<L>As that seraphic souls endure,</L>
<L>And make thy Baker blest?</L>

<L>O! haste to give my passion ease,</L>

<L>ENCHANTING is the mighty power of Love;</L>
<L>Life stript of amorous joys would irksome prove;</L>
<L>Ev'n Heaven's great Thund'rer woreth' easy chain,</L>
<L>And over all the world, Love keeps his reign;</L>
<L>No human heart can bear the piercing blade,</L>
<L>Or I than others, am more tender made.</L>
<L>Right thro' my heart a burning arrow drove,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hoyland's bright eyes, were made the bows of Love.</L>
<L>Oh! torture, inexpressibly severe!</L>
<L>You are the pleasing Author of my care;</L>
<L>Look down, fair Angel, on a Swain distrest,</L>
<L>A gracious smile from you would make me blest.</L>
<L>Nothing but that blest favour stills my grief,</L>
<L>Death, that denied, will quickly give relief.</L>

<L>SERAPHIC Virgins of the tuneful Choir,</L>
<L>Assist me to prepare the sounding lyre!</L>
<L>Like her I sing, soft, sensible, and fair,</L>
<L>Let the smooth numbers warble in the air;</L>
<L>Ye Prudes, Coquets, and all the misled throng,</L>
<L>Can Beauty, Virtue, Sense, demand the Song;</L>
<L>Look then on Clarke, and see them all unite;</L>
<L>A beauteous pattern, to the always-right.</L>
<L>Rest here, my Muse, not soar above thy sphere,</L>
<L>Kings might pay adoration to the fair,</L>
<L>Enchanting, full of joy, peerless in face and air.</L>

<L>ONCE more the Muse to beauteous H—l—d sings;</L>
<L>Her grateful tribute of harsh numbers brings</L>
<L>To H—l—d! Nature's richest, sweetest store,</L>
<L>She made an H—l—d, and can make no more.</L>
<L>Nor all the beauties of the world's vast round</L>
<L>United, will as sweet as her be found.</L>
<L>Description sickens to rehearfe her praise.</L>
<L>Her worth alone will deify my days.</L>
<L>Enchanting creature! Charms so great as thine</L>
<L>May all the beauties of the day outshine.</L>
<L>Thy eyes to ev'ry gazer send a dart,</L>
<L>Thy taking graces captivate the heart.</L>
<L>O for a Muse that shall ascend the skies,</L>
<L>And like the subject of the Epode rise;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="16"/>
To sing the sparkling eye, the portly grace,</L>
<L>The thousand beauties that adorn the face</L>
<L>Of my seraphic Maid; whose beauteous charms</L>
<L>Might court the world to rush at once to arms.</L>
<L>Whilst the fair Goddess, native of the skies,</L>
<L>Shall sit above, and be the Victor's prize.</L>
<L>O now, whil'st yet I sound the tuneful lyre,</L>
<L>I feel the thrilling joy her hands inspire;</L>
<L>When the soft tender touch awakes my blood,</L>
<L>And rolls my passions with the purple flood.</L>
<L>My pulse beat high: my throbbing breast's on fire</L>
<L>In sad variety of wild desire.</L>
<L>O H—l—d! Heav'nly Goddess! Angel, Saint,</L>
<L>Words are too weak thy mighty worth to paint;</L>
<L>Thou best, compleatest work that Nature made,</L>
<L>Thou art my substance, and I am thy shade.</L>
<L>Possess'd of thee, I joyfully would go</L>
<L>Thro' the loud tempest, and the depth of woe.</L>
<L>From thee alone my being I derive,</L>
<L>One beauteous smile from thee, makes all my hopes alive.</L>

<L>SINCE short the busy scene of life will prove,</L>
<L>Let us my H—l—d learn to live and love;</L>
<L>To love, with passions pure as morning light,</L>
<L>Whose saffron beams unsullied by the night</L>
<L>With rosy mantles do the Heavens streak,</L>
<L>Faint imitators of my H—l—d's cheek.</L>
<L>The joys of Nature in her ruin'd state</L>
<L>Have little pleasure, tho' the pains are great.</L>
<L>Virtue and Love, when sacred bands unite,</L>
<L>'Tis then that Nature leads to true delight.</L>
<L>Oft as I wander thro' the myrtle grove,</L>
<L>Bearing the beauteous burden of my love,</L>
<L>A secret terror, lest I should offend</L>
<L>The charming Maid on whom my joys depend,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="18"/>
Informs my soul, that virtuous minds alone</L>
<L>Can give a pleasure, to the vile unknown.</L>
<L>But when the body charming, and the mind,</L>
<L>To ev'ry virtuous christian act inclin'd,</L>
<L>Meet in one person, Maid and Angel join;</L>
<L>Who must it be, but H—l—d the divine?</L>
<L>What worth intrinsic will that man possess,</L>
<L>Whom the dear charmer condescends to bless?</L>
<L>Swift will the minutes roll, the flying hours,</L>
<L>And blessings overtake the pair by showers.</L>
<L>Each moment will improve upon the past,</L>
<L>And every day be better than the last.</L>
<L>Love, means an unadulterated flame,</L>
<L>Tho' lust too oft usurps the sacred name;</L>
<L>Such passion as in H—l—d's breast can move,</L>
<L>'Tis that alone deserves the name of Love.</L>
<L>Oh was my merit great enough to find</L>
<L>A favour'd station in my H—l—d's mind;</L>
<L>Then would my happiness be quite compleat,</L>
<L>And all revolving joys as in a center meet.</L>

<LG>
<L>WHAT strange infatuations rule mankind!</L>
<L>How narrow are our prospects, how confin'd!</L>
<L>With universal vanity possest,</L>
<L>We fondly think our own ideas best:</L>
<L>Our tott'ring arguments are ever strong;</L>
<L>We're always self-sufficient in the wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What philosophic Sage of pride austere</L>
<L>Can lend conviction an attentive ear?</L>
<L>What pattern of humility and truth</L>
<L>Can bear the jeering ridicule of youth?</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="25"/>
What blushing Author ever rank'd his Muse</L>
<L>With Fowler's Poet-Laureat of the Stews?</L>
<L>Dull Penny, nodding o'er his wooden lyre,</L>
<L>Conceits the vapours of Geneva fire.</L>
<L>All in the language of Apostles cry,</L>
<L>If Angels contradict me, Angels lie?</L>
<L>As all have intervals of ease and pain,</L>
<L>So all have intervals of being vain;</L>
<L>But some of folly never shift the scene,</L>
<L>Or let one lucid moment intervene;</L>
<L>Dull single acts of many-footed Prose</L>
<L>Their tragi-comedys of life compose;</L>
<L>Incessant madding for a system toy</L>
<L>The greatest of Creations blessings cloy;</L>
<L>Their senses dosing a continual dream,</L>
<L>They hang enraptured o'er the hideous scheme:</L>
<L>So virgins tott'ring into ripe three score,</L>
<L>Their greatest likeness in baboons adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When you advance new systems, first unfold</L>
<L>The various imperfections of the old;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="26"/>
Prove Nature hitherto a gloomy night,</L>
<L>You the first focus of primaeval light.</L>
<L>'Tis not enough you think your system true,</L>
<L>The busy world wou'd have you prove it too:</L>
<L>Then, rising on the ruins of the rest,</L>
<L>Plainly demonstrate your ideas best.</L>
<L>Many are best; one only can be right</L>
<L>Tho' all had inspiration to indite.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some this unwelcome truth perhaps would tell,</L>
<L>Where Clogher stumbled, Catcott fairly fell.</L>
<L>Writers on Rolls of Science long renown'd</L>
<L>In one fell page are tumbled to the ground.</L>
<L>We see their systems unconfuted still;</L>
<L>But Catcott can confute them—if he will.</L>
<L>Would you the honour of a Priest mistrust</L>
<L>An excommunication proves him just.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Could Catcott from his better sense be drawn</L>
<L>To bow the knee to Baal's sacred lawn?</L>
<L>A mitred Rascal to his long-ear'd flocks</L>
<L>Gives ill example, to his wh—s, the p-x</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="27"/>
Yet we must reverence sacerdotal black,</L>
<L>And saddle all his faults on Nature's back.</L>
<L>But hold, there's solid reason to revere;</L>
<L>His Lordship has six thousand pounds a year;</L>
<L>In gaming solitude he spends the nights,</L>
<L>He fasts at Arthur's and he prays at White's;</L>
<L>Rolls o'er the pavement with his Swiss-tail'd six,</L>
<L>At White's the Athanasian Creed for Tricks.</L>
<L>Whil'st the poor Curate in his rusty gown</L>
<L>Trudges unnotic'd thro' the dirty town.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If God made order, order never made</L>
<L>These nice distinctions in the preaching trade.</L>
<L>The servants of the Devil are rever'd,</L>
<L>And Bishops pull the Fathers by the beard.</L>
<L>Yet in these horrid forms Salvation lives,</L>
<L>These are Religions representatives;</L>
<L>Yet to these idols must we bow the knee—</L>
<L>Excuse me, Broughton, when I bow to thee.</L>
<L>But sure Religion can produce at least,</L>
<L>One Minister of God—one honest Priest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
<L>Search Nature o'er, procure me, if you can,</L>
<L>The fancy'd character, an honest Man</L>
<L>(A man of sense, not honest by constraint</L>
<L>For fools are canvass, living but in paint)</L>
<L>To Mammon, or to Superstition slaves,</L>
<L>All orders of mankind are fools, or knaves:</L>
<L>In the first attribute by none surpast,</L>
<L>Taylor endeavours to obtain the last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Imagination may be too confin'd;</L>
<L>Few see too far; how many are half blind?</L>
<L>How are your feeble arguments perplext</L>
<L>To find out meaning in a senseless text?</L>
<L>You rack each metaphor upon the wheel,</L>
<L>And words can philosophic truths conceal.</L>
<L>What Paracelsus humor'd as a jest,</L>
<L>You realize to prove your system best.</L>
<L>Might we not, Catcott, then infer from hence,</L>
<L>Your zeal for Scripture hath devour'd your sense?</L>
<L>Apply the glass of reason to your sight,</L>
<L>See Nature marshal oozy atoms right.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="29"/>
Think for yourself, for all mankind are free;</L>
<L>We need not Inspiration how to see.</L>
<L>If Scripture contradictory you find,</L>
<L>Be Orthodox, and own your senses blind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How blinded are their optics, who aver,</L>
<L>What Inspiration dictates cannot err.</L>
<L>Whence is this boasted Inspiration sent,</L>
<L>Which makes us utter truths, we never meant?</L>
<L>Which couches systems in a single word,</L>
<L>At once deprav'd, abstruse, sublime, absurd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Moses tells us might perhaps be true,</L>
<L>As he was learn'd in all the Egyptians knew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to assert that Inspiration's giv'n,</L>
<L>The Copy of Philosophy in Heav'n,</L>
<L>Strikes at Religions root, and fairly fells</L>
<L>The awful terrors of ten thousand Hells.</L>
<L>Attentive search the Scriptures and you'll find</L>
<L>What vulgar errors are with truths combin'd.</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="30"/>
Your tortur'd truths, which Moses seem'd to know,</L>
<L>He could not unto Inspiration owe;</L>
<L>For if from God one error you admit,</L>
<L>How dubious is the rest of Holy Writ?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What knotty difficultys fancy solves?</L>
<L>The Heav'ns irradiate, and the Earth revolves;</L>
<L>But here Imagination is allow'd</L>
<L>To clear this voucher from its mantling cloud:</L>
<L>From the same word we different meanings quote,</L>
<L>As David wears a many colour'd coat.</L>
</LG>

This Poem is an innocent effort of poetical Ven∣geance, as Mr. Catcott has done me the honour to criticise my Trifles. I have taken great poeti∣cal liberties and what I dislike in Verse possibly deserves my approbation in the plain Prose of Truth—The many Admirers of Mr. Catcott may on perusal of this rank me as an Enemy: But I am indifferent in all things, I value neither the praise or censure of the Multitude.</P>

<L>Their bows were broken at the roaring stream:</L>
<L>Heccar the Chief of Jarra's fruitful Hill,</L>

<L>Dreadful his voice, his eyes a glowing flame;</L>

<L>The dusky midnight hung the skies in grey;</L>
<L>Impell'd by Love, I wing'd the airy way;</L>
<L>In the deep valley and the mossy plain,</L>

The pallid shadows of the azure waves</L>

<P>THIS is the last Will and Testament of me Thomas Chatterton of the City of Bristol; being sound in body, or it is the fault of my last Sur∣geon; the soundness of my mind, the Coroner and Jury are to be judges of, desiring them to take notice, that the most perfect Masters of Human Nature in Bristol distinguish me by the title of the Mad Genius; therefore, if I do a mad action, it is conformable to every action of my life, which savour'd of insanity.</P>
<P>Item. If after my death which will happen to-morrow night before eight o'clock, being the Feast of the Resurrection, the Coroner and Jury bring it in Lunacy, I will and direct, that Paul Farr, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. John Flower, at their joint expence, cause my body to be interred in the Tomb of my Fathers, and raise the Monument over my body to the height of four feet five inches, placing the present flat stone on the top, and adding 6 Tablets.</P>

Item. From the same charitable motive, I give and bequeath unto the Reverend Mr. C—n senior all my humility.

I leave all my debts the whole not Five Pounds to the payment of the cha∣ritable and generous Chamber of Bristol, on penalty if refused, to hinder every Member from a good dinner by appearing in the form of a Bailiff. If in defiance of this terrible spectre, they obstinately persist in refusing to discharge my debts, let my two Creditors apply to the Supporters of the Bill of Rights.—Item.
