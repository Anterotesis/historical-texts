<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR;

<SP>
<LG>
<L>WHILE fears and hopes alternate thoughts suggest,</L>
<L>And now disturb, now soothe the Author's breast;</L>
<L>While expectation breathes an awful pause,</L>
<L>Ere yet the ready hand the curtain draws,</L>
<L>Ere yet the action glows—I come a spy,</L>
<L>To cast around a reconnoit'ring eye.</L>
<L>Yet then, as I this fearful Pit explore,</L>
<L>Where Authors sometimes fall to rise no more,</L>
<L>Here when th' Adventurer dares you to the field,</L>
<L>If his fond efforts some small merit yield,</L>
<L>I've seen your gen'rous arm forbear the blow,</L>
<L>And raise to life and fame the grateful foe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For you, the boist'rous inmates of the sky!</L>
<L>Bold is the man who dares your pow'r defy;</L>
<L>With you confusion her loud compact forms,</L>
<L>You ride the clouds, and are yourselves the storms.</L>
<L>Yet have I seen you mitigate your rage,</L>
<L>And spare the Adventurer struggling on the Stage;</L>
<L><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>If in some scenes (the rest tho' feebly done)</L>
<L>Unerring Nature own'd her genuine Son,</L>
<L>Your glowing soul has grasp'd the Author's cause,</L>
<L>And hurl'd around the thunder of applause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For you, ye glittering Amazonian train,</L>
<L>Whose power is dreaded on the critic plain!</L>
<L>Tho' marshal'd to the war by taste severe,</L>
<L>Yet meek indulgence follows in the rear:</L>
<L>And oft on beauty's cheek I've lov'd to trace,</L>
<L>Soft stealing down, the holy tear of grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rais'd by the thoughts these soothing hopes create,</L>
<L>I'll bid the Bard come forth, and meet his fate,</L>
<L>The tyrant Terror from his breast erase,</L>
<L>Rush on the scene, and combat for your praise.</L>

<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>IT is not action only that adorns</L>
<L>The soldier's character, it is patience,</L>
<L>Calm and induring in the rugged hour</L>
<L>Of want, that forms the nobler part of duty:</L>
<L>You, my lov'd sons, and all your fellow-sufferers,</L>
<L>Have well that rigorous iron task perform'd.</L>
<L>But now a smoother train of hours advances;</L>
<L>The truce, which at to-morrow's dawn takes place,</L>
<L>Will enable me from out the northern gate</L>
<L>To dismiss the women, the aged and the infirm,</L>
<L>Then disencumber'd of its useless numbers</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>This foe-encircled town shall raise its head;</L>
<L>The hand of scarceness shall no more dispense</L>
<L>Her meagre morsel to th' exhausted soldier,</L>
<L>But cheering competency shall provide</L>
<L>The meal.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis well! yet then inform me, Sir,</L>
<L>How you'll employ th' invaluable hours</L>
<L>That still precede the truce?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Our gallant men</L>
<L>Have been severely tried, and worn with toil.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their toil-enfeebled bodies still enclose</L>
<L>The mounting spirit of unwearied vigor.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Prompt as the hawk to dart upon his prey.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>The foe since yesterday appears to have lost</L>
<L>Half of his wonted intrepidity.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>That show'r of arrows we pour'd down at eve</L>
<L>Hath somewhat quench'd their ardor!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be it so;</L>
<L>But tell me what is now your present purpose:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>Methinks that swelling to some bold design</L>
<L>Your bosom labours.—Speak, my Valentine.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Command my elder brother, Sir, to speak.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Unfold then, Archibald, this mysterious something,</L>
<L>This painful secret that disturbs you both.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Last night, as we reclin'd upon our couch,</L>
<L>Still talking o'er (as is our wonted manner)</L>
<L>The various hazard of the busy day,</L>
<L>We wish'd, we fondly wish'd, that ere the truce</L>
<L>Should intervene, some daring enterprize</L>
<L>Might be attempted under our direction:</L>
<L>Thus we convers'd in sacred confidence</L>
<L>Till as our weak'ning voices died away</L>
<L>We wearied into rest—'twas then an image—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Mark, Sir, what now my brother will unfold.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas then an image rush'd upon my sight,</L>
<L>It shew'd as one of the angelic train,</L>
<L>A circling glory glitter'd o'er his head,</L>
<L>A smile benignant beautified his lip,</L>
<L>And thus he spoke—'Sons of the valiant Seaton,</L>
<L>Arise and hasten to the southern gate,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="12"/>Thence dart upon the foe.'—The vision ceas'd</L>
<L>And vanish'd into air! while a rude noise</L>
<L>Like the fierce struggle of contending spears</L>
<L>Suddenly waked us! Starting from my couch,</L>
<L>And ere I cou'd communicate my dream,</L>
<L>Valentine with impatient voice disclos'd</L>
<L>The mutual vision.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas as he relates;</L>
<L>By honor's winnow'd purity I swear</L>
<L>The nightly visitation also came</L>
<L>To me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hazard no impeachment of</L>
<L>Your truth; yet then, endearing children, tell me</L>
<L>How can a prudent tender parent send</L>
<L>His valiant sons to danger's precipice</L>
<L>At the fantastic impulse of a dream?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>In the old time we read that dreams have often</L>
<L>Been the prophetic leaders to success.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh do not, Sir, with caution's chill restraint</L>
<L>O'ershade the splendid purpose of our soul.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Let the bright vision be forgot, if that</L>
<L>Offend you, and attend to reason's voice:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>Does not the weary foe anticipate</L>
<L>Th' approaching truce, and guard neglectingly</L>
<L>The southern gate?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis a mask'd neglect,</L>
<L>It is the couchant lion prompt to seize</L>
<L>Th' unwary prey—ah! trust not to his stern</L>
<L>Repose.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>If danger still must check the current</L>
<L>Of enterprize, tell, tell me, Father, wherefore</L>
<L>You rear'd us in the hardy school of war?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>The road to martial glory well thou know'st</L>
<L>Is not gay-sprinkled o'er with flowers, but broken</L>
<L>Helmets, shiver'd spears, and blood-stain'd arrows</L>
<L>Choak up th' aspiring path of fame's ascent.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>To be restrain'd when proud occasion calls,</L>
<L>'Twere better thou hadst led me to some cloister,</L>
<L>Where holy peace resides, o'er-canopied</L>
<L>By antient roofs, that ever shade her from</L>
<L>The madd'ning sun-beams of ambition's sky.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Forbear to torture thus a parent's feelings.</L>

<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Indulgent Father, rest assur'd we both</L>
<L>Pay homage to the thought that now disturbs you;</L>
<L>But with th' experienced Melvil we have just</L>
<L>Conferr'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>And he undoubtedly contemn'd</L>
<L>Your gaudy dream, that meteor of the brain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twas not the meteor of a heated brain,</L>
<L>It was a sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beam of revealing Heaven,</L>
<L>It was the sympathetic glow of two</L>
<L>According minds.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Of this enough—What said</L>
<L>Th' experienc'd Melvil?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>After due attention</L>
<L>To our proposal, he first stamp'd it with</L>
<L>The seal of his applause, and then added</L>
<L>Arguments that embodied as it were</L>
<L>Our enterprize, and brighten'd it with the</L>
<L>Calm colouring of reason.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will myself</L>
<L>Confer with Melvil; and if he has words</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="15"/>To smooth the rugged doubts that vex my mind,</L>
<L>Think not, my valiant sons, I shall withhold</L>
<L>You from the object of your bold request</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>To keep unsullied the bright martial name</L>
<L>Of Seaton, is indeed my proudest wish.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>And if thy Valentine might add his mite</L>
<L>To the rich treasury of his Father's fame,</L>
<L>He would be happy.</L>

<SPEAKER>SIR ALEXANDER.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wait till I return.</L>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Excellent man! his ardour to promote</L>
<L>Our cause, and his solicitude about</L>
<L>Our safety, combat and distract his will.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>More active, warm, and forcible affection</L>
<L>Was ne'er embosom'd in a father's soul;</L>
<L>And therefore much I fear that Melvil can't</L>
<L>Subdue his scruples.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oft have I observ'd</L>
<L>That Melvil's clear illumin'd manly judgment</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="16"/>Possesses something like magnetic power,</L>
<L>Which still attracts opinion to his side.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>May that attractive power be at this moment</L>
<L>Endued with double influence, that my Father</L>
<L>Withholding his restraint, I might unbounded</L>
<L>Spring against the foe!—This common praise</L>
<L>That's claim'd by every soldier, ill supplies</L>
<L>My starv'd and craving appetite of fame.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Endearing Valentine, think not that I</L>
<L>Reprove these flashes of an ardent mind;</L>
<L>But should your mounting wishes meet controul,</L>
<L>Wound not a Father's tender caution with</L>
<L>Reproach.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VALENTINE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Sooner than wound his feeling mind</L>
<L>With sullen, splenetic, unduteous carriage,</L>
<L>I wou'd, like the Spartan boy (who silently</L>
<L>Endur'd the gnawing fox) conceal my sorrow,</L>
<L>Though, like the savage animal, it should</L>
<L>Prey upon my vitals.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARCHIBALD.</SPEAKER>
<L>Consider also</L>
<L>This warlike age will gratify your wishes</L>

<L>Speak not of danger,</L>

<L>Had England's warlike king suppress'd his son's</L>
