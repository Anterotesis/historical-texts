<P>WHEN I inscribe this Tragedy to you, I mean to pay myself a very high compliment; the utmost I could possibly say of you, would by no means extend your Reputation; but it will do me much honour to declare, that so celebrated a writer has distinguished CLEMENTINA with the most essential attention; and that so valuable a man has given me leave to sign myself, what I truly am,</P>

<L>IN these, our moral and religious days,</L>
<L>Men dread the crying sin of writing Plays;</L>
<L>While some, whose wicked wit incurs the blame,</L>
<L>Howe'er they love the trespass, fly the shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If, a new holy war with Vice to wage,</L>
<L>Some preacher quits the pulpit for the stage,</L>

<L>Attempts to give his Evening-Lecture here.</L>
<L>The work engender'd, to the world must rise;</L>
<L>But yet the father may elude our eyes.</L>
<L>The parish on this trick of youth might frown,</L>
<L>And thus, unown'd, 'tis thrown upon the Town.</L>
<L>At our Director's door he lays the sin,</L>
<L>Who sees the Babe, relents, and takes it in;</L>
<L>To swathe and dress it first unstrings his purse,</L>
<L>Then kindly puts it out to You—to nurse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Should some young Counsel, thro' his luckless star,</L>
<L>By writing Plays turn truant to the Bar.</L>
<L>Call'd up by you to this High Court of Wit,</L>
<L>With non <HI>inventus</HI> we return the writ.</L>
<L>No <HI>latitat</HI> can force him to appear,</L>
<L>Whose failure and success cause equal fear,</L>
<L>Whatever fees his clients here bestow,</L>
<L>He loses double in the Courts below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Grave solemn Doctors, whose prescribing pen</L>
<L>Has in the trade of Death kill'd many men,</L>
<L><PB N="x" REF="6"/>With vent'rous quill here tremblingly engage</L>

<L>Some Demireps in wit, of doubtful fame,</L>
<L>Tho' known to all the town, withhold their name.</L>
<L>Thus each by turns ungratefully refuse</L>
<L>To own the favours of their Lady-Muse;</L>
<L>Woo'd by the Court, the College, Bar and Church,</L>
<L>Court, Bar, Church, College, leave her in the lurch.</L>

<L>Cast me a houseless wand'rer on the world,</L>
<L>Yet shall my soul with unabating firmness</L>
<L>Deny her sanction to Palermo's claim.</L>
<L>O Elizara, you who know the cause,</L>
<L>The endless cause of Clementina's tears,</L>
<L>Who saw the awful, tho' the secret rite</L>
<L>That gave this hand, now widow'd, to Rinaldo;</L>
<L>Is there, in all the various rounds of woe,</L>
<L>A curse so great, a pang so exquisite,</L>

<SPEAKER>CLEMENTINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh memory! ev'n madness cannot lose it!</L>
<L>Mangled with wounds, amidst unnumber'd foes;</L>
<L>My hapless husband for his country fell!</L>
<L>Yet, the sad story of our loves conceal'd,</L>
<L>I was allow'd no privilege of tears,</L>
<L>But doom'd to hide the anguish of my heart.—</L>
<L>And now, in all the fulness of despair,</L>
<L>To have another forc'd upon me! horror!</L>
<L>It is not to be borne!—But I'm resolv'd,</L>
<L>And will devote the remnant of my life</L>
<L>To lost Rinaldo's memory, or die</L>
<L>Some little hour before my griefs would end me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alas, I feel the sorrows of your bosom,</L>
<L>With all the ardent sympathy of friendship;</L>
<L>And know how souls so delicate as yours,</L>
<L>Must spurn th' idea of a second lord.</L>
<L>Yet blame no more the sternness of Anselmo;</L>

<L>Between your angry father and Rinaldo's,</L>
<L>First urg'd the measure of a private union.</L>
<L>A stranger therefore to your grief, Anselmo</L>
<L>Claims but the right which custom, and which nature,</L>
<L>Have long giv'n parents o'er their children's hearts.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLEMENTINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What claim, what right, misjudging Elizara,</L>
<L>Can tyrant custom plead, or nature urge</L>
<L>To force the free election of the soul?</L>
<L>Say, should affection light the nuptial torch,</L>
<L>Or should the rash decision of a father</L>
<L>Doom his sad race to wretchedness for ever?</L>
<L>No, Elizara; custom has no force,</L>
<L>Nature no right, to sanctify oppression;</L>
<L>And parents vainly tell us of indulgence,</L>
<L>When they give all but happiness to children.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>True—yet a cruel crisis in your fate,</L>
<L>Has much to offer for the good Anselmo.</L>
<L>He fondly thinks his daughter disengag'd;</L>
<L>Believes too, fondly, that Palermo's merit</L>
<L>Must touch the gentle bosom of my friend:</L>
<L>If then determin'd to reject his choice,</L>
<L>At once throw off constraint—at once be open,</L>
<L>And seal his lips for ever on the subject,</L>
<L>By a frank mention of your fatal story.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLEMENTINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>What! and expose my dear Rinaldo's kindred</L>
<L>To all the fury of enrag'd Anselmo,</L>
<L>The now acknowledg'd ruler of the state;</L>
<L>Who, tho' renown'd for wisdom and for justice.</L>
<L>Yet in the points, the cruel points of honour,</L>
<L>Is rigid, stern, and fatally severe?</L>
<L>No, Elizara; tho' these fading eyes</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>No more must hope to gaze upon Rinaldo,</L>
<L>Tho' the soul-swelling language of my woes,</L>
<L>Falls unregarded on the silent tomb,</L>

<L>From the dark, dreary mansions of the dead;</L>
<L>Still let me guard whatever he held dear,</L>
<L>Nor pluck down added ruin on his house!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Anselmo's justice will o'ercome his hatred—</L>
<L>Were he inclin'd to make his will his law,</L>
<L>Or wish'd for means to gratify resentment,</L>
<L>He has the pow'r already; but his mind,</L>
<L>Superior ever to the thought of wrong,</L>
<L>Can feel no passion to disgrace his virtue.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLEMENTINA.</SPEAKER>
<L>The best may err, nor will I tempt his rage;</L>
<L>The mighty measure of my woe is full—</L>
<L>Why then, when fate's unmerciful decree</L>
<L>Has curs'd me up to such a height of ill,</L>
<L>Why should I shudder at the gathering storm,</L>
<L>Or seek for shelter in another's sorrow?</L>
<L>I now have no asylum but the grave:</L>
<L>Tho' did peace court me from the bow'rs of bliss,</L>
<L>My soul would scorn to hear the charmer's voice,</L>
<L>If she requir'd me to perform a deed,</L>
<L>That either shock'd my justice, or my honour.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ELIZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then summon all your firmness, Clementina!</L>
<L>For here Anselmo comes, and brings Palermo;</L>
<L>O that your terrors for Rinaldo's kindred,</L>
<L>May stiil subside, and hear the voice of reason!</L>
<L>Your soul is ill adapted to disguise;</L>
<L>And without cause to disappoint his views,</L>

<SPEAKER>PALERMO.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis just, my lord—But still however lovely,</L>
<L>The soft emotion of these gentle terrors,</L>
<L>Spreads in the blooming daughters of perfection,</L>
<L>Still Clementina might have kindly giv'n</L>

<L>And nobly told him that his ruin'd fortunes</L>
<L>Were ev'n deem'd merit with Anselmo's daughter.</L>

<L>Think not, Palermo, of your ruin'd fortunes;</L>

<SPEAKER>PALERMO.</SPEAKER>
<L>When sharp adversity has stung the mind,</L>
<L>It makes us doubly conscious of neglect:</L>

<L>A home to rest in from the weight of chains—</L>
<L>Our French ally, the nobly-minded Lewis,</L>

<L>Yes, my Elizara;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fell indeed amidst the gen'ral carnage,</L>
<L>And lay some hours among the honour'd dead;</L>
<L>For whom the vanquish'd, France's gen'rous sons</L>
<L>Made one bold effort to obtain a grave:</L>
<L>Here a brave youth of that exalted nation,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="21"/>Close by whose side with emulative fire</L>
<L>I sought for Venice on that hapless day;</L>
<L>Beheld the man he deign'd to call his friend,</L>
<L>And by a kind of miracle restor'd me.—</L>
<L>Then to the king in terms of warmest weight,</L>
<L>Proclaim'd my fancied merits.—Royal Lewis</L>
<L>Received the story with a gracious ear,</L>

<SPEAKER>ELIZARA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why then, O why, distinguish'd thus, thus honour'd,</L>
<L>Did not Rinaldo sooth his sorrowing friends,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>O Elizara! how my soul has felt</L>
<L>For all the anguish she was doom'd to suffer,</L>
<L>That heaven, which knows the greatness of my love,</L>
<L>Alone can witness.—But the conquering arms</L>
<L>Of widely wasting Ferdinand, cut off</L>
<L>Our commerce with the world—and had not fate,</L>
<L>In two late fields propitious smil'd upon us,</L>
<L>Rinaldo yet, distracted and forlorn,</L>
<L>Had drag'd a chain of miserab'le being;</L>
<L>Nor known, as now he shall, th' extatic bliss</L>

<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>For ends of moment.—If the charge I bear</L>
<L>Meets, as I hope, and as I think it ought,</L>

<L>I come determin'd to avow my marriage;</L>

<L>You talk, Rinaldo, with an air of triumph;</L>
<L>Think you the first of our Venetian daughters,</L>

<L>Borne from her palace compass'd round with guards,</L>
<L>Surrounding virgins, and a watchful father?</L>

<L>Has reach'd no ear of Venice but your own,</L>
<L>Can there exist a doubt of my success?</L>
<L>Unknown—unnotic'd—unsuspected quite,</L>
<L>A trusty friend shall lead her to the beach,</L>

<L>Rinaldo shou'd pursue a diff'rent course,</L>

<L>Well, Sir, the views of Lewis are at length</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, sage Anselmo, this offended brow?</L>
<L>I trust my master's offers have deserv'd</L>
<L>Your highest approbation; for they breathe</L>
<L>Nought but attachment, and regard for Venice.</L>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>ANSELMO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is this the basis of his love for Venice?</L>
<L>Has he stood forth a champion for our freedom,</L>
<L>Merely himself to tread us into slaves?</L>
<L>And sav'd us from the arm of haughty Spain,</L>
<L>To make us bear his own oppressive yoke?</L>
<L>Go tell your king, and tell him from Anselmo,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="24"/>That France and Venice can be friends no more;</L>
<L>Tell him, to us, all tyrants are the same;</L>
<L>Or if in bonds the never-conquer'd soul</L>
<L>Can feel a pang more keen than slav'ry's self,</L>
<L>'Tis when the chains, that crush us into dust,</L>
<L>Are forg'd by hands from which we hop'd for freedom.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what idea does my business raise,</L>
<L>Of slaves or tyrants, servitude or chains?</L>
<L>'Tis true, the gracious Lewis has propos'd</L>
<L>To take the state of Venice to his care,</L>
<L>If sage Anselmo, her illustrious leader,</L>
<L>Approves the scheme of well-concerted empire—</L>
<L>He sees with deep, with nobly-minded sorrow,</L>
<L>How, still expos'd to ev'ry pow'rful neighbour,</L>
<L>You fall a victim to alternate spoilers;</L>
<L>Hence, with paternal tenderness, he wishes</L>
<L>T' enroll your sons among the sons of France,</L>
<L>And make the subjects of his diff'rent realms,</L>
<L>One equal, common, and united people.</L>
<L>If this be slav'ry—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ANSELMO.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis the worst of slav'ry,</L>
<L>Tamely to bend Our necks beneath the yoke,</L>
<L>And suffer fraud, to talk us out of freedom.—</L>
<L>If we must yield before superior force,</L>
<L>Let us at least deserve the name of men;</L>
<L>Let us fall nobly, if we are to fall,</L>
<L>And give the world in characters of blood,</L>
<L>Eternal causes to lament our fate,</L>
<L>But never one occasion to despise us!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GRANVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<L>Far from my bosom be the abject thought!</L>
<L>To stoop the servile minister of greatness,</L>

<L>Venice <HI>is grown samiliar to our stage.</HI></L>
<L>Here the <HI>Rialto</HI> often has display'd</L>
<L>At once a bridge, a street, and mart of trade;</L>

<L>Mask'd and disguis'd the ladies meet their sparks,</L>
<L>While <HI>Venus</HI> bails the mummers of <HI>St. Mark's.</HI></L>
<L>There holy friars turn gallants, and there too</L>
<L>Nuns yield to all the frailties—"Flesh is heir to."</L>
<L>There dear Ridottos constantly delight,</L>
<L>And sweet Harmonic Meetings ev'ry night!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once in each year the <HI>Doge</HI> ascends his barge,</L>
<L>Fine as a <HI>London</HI> Mayor's, and thrice as large;</L>
<L>Throws a huge ring of gold into the sea,</L>
<L>And cries—"Thus We, thy Sov'reign, marry thee.</L>
<L>Oh may'st thou ne'er, like many a mortal spouse,</L>
<L>Prove full of storms, and faitbless to thy vows!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One word of politics—and then Pve done—</L>
<L>The state of <HI>Venice</HI> Nobles rule alone.</L>
<L>Thrice happy <HI>Britain,</HI> where with equal band</L>
<L>Three well pois'd states unite to rule the land!</L>
<L>Thus in the theatre, as well as state.</L>
<L>Three ranks must join to make us bless'd and great.</L>
<L>King, Lords, and Commons, o'er the nation sit;</L>
<L>Pit, Box, and Gallery, rule the realms of wit.</L>
