<HEAD>THE HISTORY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OU desire me to give you some Account of the Death of the <HI>Widow</HI> at the <HI>CROWN-INN</HI> in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of this Country; and how Affairs have gone since you left the Place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow,</HI> you know, was a good sort of a Woman; she was Pious and Charitable, and did a great deal of Good among her poor Neighbours: Went constantly to the Parish-Church on <HI>Sundays,</HI> and in general had the Character of a conscientious motherly Wo∣man.</P>
<P>Her Husband, whilst he lived, was one of the honestest Men breathing: 'Tis true he would take his Glass in Company, as all his Countrymen will do: But he was a downright honest Fellow, and lov'd the Town; and we shall never forget how tightly he stood by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> our High Sheriff, would have infring'd on our <HI>Right of Commoning.</HI> Poor Man! he kept her from ill Advice whilst
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
he lived, and the whole Country was heartily sorry for his Death, having not left an ho∣nester Man behind him in the <HI>Parish.</HI></P>
<P>But what need I tell you things which you are as well acquainted with as my self, only to refresh your Memory in some <HI>Passages</HI> previous to your Request? You desire to know the Disposition of the Estate, and how the <HI>Three Farms</HI> stand affected at this Day.</P>
<P>You remember at her first coming to the House, she found the Debts of an old <HI>Law-Suit</HI> to be paid, which had lasted long, and a new one just ready to begin, which no body could guess the Event of. Money there was little or none in the House; and only a few <HI>Exchequer</HI> Notes, which no body but the Ex∣ciseman would take for Ready Money.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Customers</HI> were very un∣willing to see her ruined; and as she had treated them very handsomly at her <HI>House∣warming,</HI> they swore they would stand by her against all Opposers. By Opposers you know who they meant: For it was by this time certainly known, that old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage,</HI> the Ex∣tortioner, had set up a <HI>Competitor</HI> against her, <HI>Pretending</HI> he was a real <HI>Branch</HI> of the anti∣ent Family of the <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s, formerly Lords of the <HI>MANOR,</HI> and brought a Writ of E∣jectment in his Name, and fee'd Council a∣gainst the Widow. This <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI> is one who has always made it his business to entertain Renegadoes and Impostors; and by forged Deeds and Wills to take Possession of Estates,
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
and then maintain them by trouble some Law Suits; till at last he has shared a handsome Composition for himself. You cannot chuse too but know, that both by <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Deed</HI> of <HI>Gift,</HI> the House it self as well as the <HI>Three Farms</HI> had been settled on her near <HI>Kinsman</HI> Mr. WRIGHT, (a Man whom all the honest <HI>Tenants</HI> wished to succeed her) as well in her Life, as in the time of her <HI>Predecessor.</HI></P>
<P>To be short (as you must needs know) a hazardous <HI>Suit</HI> commenced; and because it should not lye too hard upon the Widow, ma∣ny of her Friends became Parties to it. Ho∣nest <HI>John Trusty,</HI> by general Consent was made chief Agent in the <HI>Cause,</HI> who the first <HI>Term</HI> put the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Affairs in a good Po∣sture; and for several <HI>Terms</HI> following was continually gaining one Advantage or other over her Adversaries; so that they began now to sue for <HI>Composition,</HI> and a Meeting was appointed on both sides, but refusing to allow sufficient Costs and Damages, the <HI>Law</HI> went on.</P>
<P>In this promising State stood Affairs, when that furious <HI>Pulpiteer,</HI> the <HI>Curate</HI> of <HI>High-Ham,</HI> came to preach at <HI>Hockley,</HI> where ha∣ving pack'd up a Sermon for the purpose, he infus'd Sedition among the <HI>Widow</HI>'s <HI>Tenants</HI> and <HI>Customers,</HI> insinuating that she began to sell in <HI>short Measure,</HI> Brew'd with <HI>Home-made Malt,</HI> and let her <HI>Lawyers, Book-keepers, Ost∣lers, Chamberlain, Tapster, &amp;c.</HI> run away with what should pay the <HI>Excise.</HI> He in∣veighed
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
vehemently against the <HI>Parson of the Parish,</HI> and other <HI>Heads</HI> of tke Town, for not repairing the CHURCH, one part of which he said was <HI>damaged</HI> and ready to <HI>fall;</HI> whilst the <HI>Conventicle</HI> was upheld by some about her, and a Parcel of <HI>GYPSIES</HI> kept privately in the <HI>Barn</HI> to eat her out of House and Home.</P>
<P>The Fellow had a good Talent at Railing, and could run on with as much Impudence as a Mountebank exhibits his Pacquet: In short the Poison worked so subtly, that the whole Country was put in a Ferment. The Curate was taken up, and brought before the <HI>Bench of Justices;</HI> where tho' he was repri∣manded, and ordered to find Sureties for his <HI>Good Behaviour</HI> for 3 Years, yet it did not quiet the People, who cry'd out, <HI>The Church, the Church!</HI> and ran up and down in Tu∣mults, as tho' it had been falling on their Heads; whilst to strengthen the matter, the <HI>Curate</HI> took a <HI>Journey</HI> round the Country, possessing the People that the <HI>House</HI> was haunted, and bid them take care how they came near it any more, directing them to the <HI REND="blackletterType">Pope</HI>'s <HI REND="blackletterType">Head</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">Dagger,</HI> near the <HI REND="blackletterType">Cross.</HI></P>
<P>At this time one <HI>Robin Sly-boots,</HI> a <HI>Welch Button-maker,</HI> a notorious cunning Fellow, and fam'd for a <HI>Conjurer,</HI> who had formerly belonged to the Family, but was turned out, for making too bold with the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Secrets. This Fellow took his Opportunity to cor∣rupt one of the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Maids, by pretending
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
to tell her her Fortune, which such gigling Wenches are generally fond of; so that taking her one Day, as she was sweeping the Rooms, and making the Beds, he began in this manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Nab,</HI> says he, I have often taken notice that thou art a Pains-taking, industrious Girl, and hast lived a great while in thy Service without coming to any Advance∣ment. 'Tis true, you sweep the Rooms, make the Beds, and get a little sorry Vails of the <HI>Guests,</HI> but 'tis Mrs. <HI>Sarah</HI> runs away with all the Profit, and keeps her whole Family at your Mistresses charge. But tho' she now flouts the <HI>Widow,</HI> and flies and bounces like bottled Ale, thou shalt one day, if thou tak'st my Advice, come to be as high as she: Remember it, <HI>Nab,</HI> I say, thou shalt come to be a Lady."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bless me, says <HI>Nab,</HI> (with a simpering Countenance, knowing he had long had the Reputation of a Conjurer) is it possible that I should come to such Preferment as you say? That you may believe me, says <HI>Robin,</HI> go presently, and look on the Bed in the <HI>Green Room,</HI> there lies a <HI>Calicoe Gown</HI> and <HI>Peticoat,</HI> lin'd thro' with the same; ask your Mistress for it, and she will give it you. As you find this true, believe me in the rest."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nab,</HI> no longer able to contain her self flung down her Besom, and ran to the place, where finding it as he had said, she returned overjoyed.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, Mr: <HI>Slyboots,</HI> says <HI>Nab,</HI> how is this thing to be effected? I'll tell you, says <HI>Robin,</HI>—At Midnight, when all things are quiet, you shall plant me in some Cor∣ner; and for the greater Solemnity I will have my <HI>Conjurers Gown</HI> on. You must on your part infuse strange things into her Head, and tell her as many <HI>Tales</HI> as you can of the Servants. Then bring in some talk of the <HI>Curate;</HI> tell her what a good Man he is, and that he had always a great Respect for her; insinuate that the Design of bring∣ing him before the <HI>Bench of Justices</HI> was to disgrace the <HI>Church;</HI> and that those who were his Friends, she may assure her self are hers; and whilst she is musing on these things, for I know it will work on her Re∣ligious Spirit, I will appear, and then leave the rest to me."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nab,</HI> in the mean time, had got the <HI>Gown</HI> and <HI>Peticoat</HI> which <HI>Robin</HI> spoke of, and was pretty sure the rest of his <HI>Predictions</HI> would follow. In fine, the <HI>Widow</HI> was so possessed and deluded by <HI>Nab</HI>'s whining, and this <HI>Con∣juring</HI> Rascal's Cant, that, tho' otherwise a Woman of Sense, she grew perfectly en∣flam'd, so that without examining farther in∣to the matter, giving Ear to <HI>Nab</HI>'s Tales, she presently began to Reform her Family; and a great many of the honestest <HI>Tenants</HI> had warning given them against the next Quar∣ter-day. However the <HI>Law-Suit</HI> continuing, they did not yet think fit to turn out honest
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>John</HI> the <HI>Agent,</HI> because the taking the <HI>Papers</HI> out of his Hands might be dangerous to the <HI>CAUSE.</HI></P>
<P>Among the rest, to make room for <HI>Robin, Ralph</HI> the <HI>Cash-keeper</HI> was dismissed, a down∣right honest Fellow, and had held his Place long with great Integrity, tho' many of her best <HI>Customers</HI> told her they would leave the House, and stand by her no longer, if she took these Courses. But all did not avail; every thing went as <HI>Robin</HI> advised; in fine, she turn'd away all her old honest Servants, dis∣solved the <HI>Club</HI> that was kept at her House, and none were held in favour, but such as had appeared to be Friends to the <HI>Curate,</HI> or were <HI>Robin</HI>'s Creatures. <HI>Robin</HI> was first made <HI>Book-keeper</HI> and <HI>Under-Cash-keeper,</HI> and after <HI>Head-Cash-keeper,</HI> which was what he all along aim∣ed at. He grew angry now at being called plain <HI>Robin,</HI> and nothing would go down but Mr. <HI>Slyboots</HI> at every word. He changed his Sign, which was before the <HI>Three Button-moles,</HI> and hung up in the room of it the <HI>Star</HI> and <HI>Garter</HI> finely painted, and had Vanity and Im∣pudence enough to take the two <HI>Angels</HI> for <HI>Supporters</HI> to his <HI>Sign-Post.</HI> All that he said or did, if it may bear an old Pun, was <HI>Bob as a Robin;</HI> he brought in all his Friends, Fel∣lows as poor as <HI>Howlets,</HI> to rule the Roast, and fill their hungry Bellies at the Widow's Table; such an avaritious Crew as were hard∣ly worth hanging; a Medley of <HI>Welch Crate-Carriers, Pedlars,</HI> Retalers of <HI>Hob-nails, Brick∣dust,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
&amp;c. and among the rest advanced <HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> the Brazier, an audacious, lewd young Fellow, to be one of the <HI>Clerks of the Brew-house.</HI> This was a docible young Dog for <HI>Robin</HI>'s Purpose, and by a pert way of speaking in the <HI>Club,</HI> dexterously advanc'd the Reputation of <HI>Robin</HI>'s Proceedings. In short, all went swimmingly in the <HI>INN</HI> for a Year or two, and the Rogues with thriving Faces, caressed one another in their Iniquity.</P>
<P>But they found the <HI>Law-Suit</HI> began to hang heavy on their Hands; they had not the same Credit that the former Servants had to borrow Money, and they had none of their own to lend: The <HI>Rino</HI> was wanted to pay Fees, and the <HI>Tenants</HI> were very backward to advance more; so that finding they were like to bring an old House upon their Heads if they went on, they were resolved at any rate to come to an Accommodation; and <HI>Harry Aucumy</HI> was sent privately to old <HI REND="blackletterType">Sa∣vage</HI>'s House to treat about it, tho' they had still told the <HI>Tenants</HI> it should be push'd on <HI>vigorously</HI> next <HI>Term,</HI> and constantly got Money out of them for that purpose.</P>
<P>Thinking their Business was now done, they put honest <HI>John Trusty</HI> out of the Agency, and like a Parcel of ungrateful Curs, set their Black Guard to pelt him; but the honest Peo∣ple of the Town could not forbear expressing their Love in respect to his upright and judici∣ous Dealing, by welcoming him Home with loud Acclamations, which fretted the Rogues
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
to the Plucks to see him so caressed, by whose good <HI>Management</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> had been brought to that Issue, that <HI>Judgment</HI> was order'd to be enter'd up, and <HI>Execution</HI> would certain∣ly have follow'd the very next <HI>Term.</HI> It will be tedious to relate all the intricate Passages of the Law, and how the Widow's Friends resolv'd to carry the Cause on without her, but that <HI>Robin</HI> had ordered the new <HI>Agent Jacob Rush</HI> to stifle many of the chief Wit∣nesses, by which the Adversary's Attorney found means to stop Judgment.</P>
<P>To amuse the <HI>Tenants,</HI> who they knew would be alarm'd at this Proceeding, it was given out, that the <HI>Widow</HI>'s <HI>Friends</HI> had not paid their share of the <HI>Law-Charges,</HI> but that all the <HI>Burden</HI> had lain upon her, which had run her grievously in Debt, and that she was in a manner forc'd to a Composition, and had Offers now of a very good one, much to the Advantage of her self and her <HI>Friends.</HI> This took with the silly People, and in spight of all the Intreaties of her honest <HI>Tenants,</HI> an Agreement soon followed, which however had taken up more Time and Money to effect, than would have decided it at <HI>Common-Law.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true we burnt our Faggot-stacks, set the Bells a ringing, and illumined our Win∣dows, but we soon experienc'd, that Humilia∣tion would have become us better. The House lost its Trade, and no body in Town almost had any thing to do. People began to see into this, when it was too late, and no Remedy
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
could be found to help them. Our <HI>old Friends</HI> exclaimed against us, as a treacherous and base sort of People, and shun'd the Town, and our new ones apparently slighted us, tho' we had done them such signal Service: Nor could we so much as obtain to have the <HI>Quarter-Sessions</HI> kept here, tho' our Credit before used to draw every Body to us.</P>
<P>They began to cavil now at the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Will in favour of Mr. WRIGHT, and tho' they durst not openly declare themselves, yet 'tis known they were endeavouring to invei∣gle the People into an Opinion of young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s Title, and dispers'd <HI>Papers</HI> to prove it; nor did they use Mr. WRIGHT as tho' they ever expected he would come to the Estate. All we could do was to wish them hang'd be∣fore they should bring it to pass; for you must know we hate the young Fellow hear∣tily: His Father, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> (if he was ho∣nestly begot) used us horribly, quarter'd Soldiers upon us, threaten'd our <HI>Charter,</HI> and play'd the Devil for God's sake thro' the whole Country till we were fain to send him packing; and 'tis very well known the young Rogue will never forgive us for't.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow</HI> being to send one to old <HI REND="blackletterType">Sa∣vage</HI>'s to adjust Accounts on the Accommoda∣tion, who should these <HI>Achitophels</HI> advise her to but <HI>Jacob Booty,</HI> a notorious Friend to the Fa∣mily of the <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI>'s. This put us in such a Fright that we were ready to offer a Leg or Arm, out of every Family for Indemnity: For
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
we supposed he could have no other <HI>Business</HI> but to strike up a Bargain at old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI>'s; but as it happened we had the good Fortune to see him die in a Ditch before he set out, and save the H—n a labour, whose Occupati∣on, 'tis said, he had merited a few Years before by endeavouring to give the <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> Possession of the <HI>North</HI> Farm, with design to burn and plunder it, if he could not hold it by Law.</P>
<P>In short, every Day produced fresh Instances of our Misfortunes, and of the Villanies of those who had betray'd us: Old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage,</HI> who be∣fore we had reduced to be as poor as a <HI>Church Mouse,</HI> so that he lay even at our Mercy, be∣gan to bully us again, reserving many of the Conditions of the Agreement unexecuted. He demolished a <HI>Turn-pike</HI> upon the <HI>River,</HI> which had been a great Annoyance to our <HI>Trade,</HI> but fallaciously erected another a lit∣tle nearer home, and eluded the chief Article of the <HI>Accommodation;</HI> he promised to dismiss young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI> out of his Family, and with a mental Reservation only sent him to board with one of his Tenants at next Door. More∣over he engaged to use his Interest with young <HI>Savage</HI> his Grandson in behalf of some <HI>Poor People</HI> that lay at his Mercy on account of serving the <HI>Widow,</HI> who appear'd under a great concern for them, instead of which like an accomplish'd <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> he sent his <HI>Mirmi∣dons</HI> and <HI>Bayliffs</HI> to haul them to <HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Every thing was acted with the same Can∣dour, and seem'd to be pulling on our Ruin, whilst our <HI>Agents</HI> at home, out of the poor∣ness of Spirit, durst not wag a Tongue, or a Finger against him, they lay so open and so exposed by the Rogueries he was privy to. Ah poor <HI>Country!</HI> What could relieve thee but a Miracle? Or what animate thy Hopes, but the Interposition of <HI>Providence,</HI> that dear, that eternal Providence, which had rescu'd thee in the like Cases of imminent Danger? Would you believe it, Sir, that these <HI>Despe∣rados</HI> having no other way to shelter them∣selves, were just entering into a Conspiracy to undermine Mr. WRIGHT's Interest, and carry the Trade to the <HI REND="blackletterType">Pope</HI>'s-<HI REND="blackletterType">Head.</HI></P>
<P>It could not be expected that Men associated in Mischief should long agree among them∣selves, which Maxim 'tis very probable pro∣duced the old Proverb; <HI>When</HI> R—s <HI>and</HI> W—s <HI>fall out honest Men come by their Goods.</HI> You may apply it as you please; the use I shall make of it is only to tell you that the House began to be divided against itself, and so could not stand long; <HI>Robin</HI> had now brought up a Bird to pick out his Eyes; his <HI>Pupil Harry</HI> had got the Start of him, and jock∣eyed him out of the <HI>Widow</HI>'s Favour. <HI>Harry</HI> took up a Resolution to spur at all, <HI>aut Caesar aut nullus;</HI> but <HI>Robin,</HI> who had always a great Veneration for his Neck, was willing to jog on soberly; <HI>Harry,</HI> out of the Vivacity of his Temper, told him, he was a Fellow of no Spi∣rit,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
and that his Cowardice quite baulk'd the Cause: Yes, says <HI>Robin,</HI> (very dryly) but it may be a means of saving your Neck, if you take Example by it, and act with a little more Deliberation and Gravity. This in the end came to an open Rupture, so that one Day a∣bove the rest they fell to it Pel mel before the <HI>Widow. Robin</HI> among other things charged him with Ingratitude, and told him, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He took him up an idle, loose, young Fellow, stragling about the Town, when he had hardly nine Pence in his Pocket to go to a Whore withal; that he brought him ac∣quainted at the Widow's, and put him into Business he might live handsomely upon, if he had the Grace to follow it; but that it was plain he was as loose as ever, and his Management would be the Ruin of his Mi∣stress, if he went on as he begun."</Q> <HI>Harry</HI> justly fired at this Language, call'd him <HI>muddy-headed Fellow,</HI> and said, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If it had not been for him, his <HI>Mistress</HI> might have made a more advantageous <HI>Composition.</HI>"</Q><HI> Robin,</HI> in return to that, upbraided him with his hair∣brain'd Negotiations, and that he suffer'd him∣self to be made drunk, and over-reach'd at old <HI REND="blackletterType">Savage</HI>'s, where, says he, unless your <HI>Inter∣view</HI> with young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute</HI> (for which I hope to see you hang'd,) a few fine Congees, and two or three lewd <HI>Intrigues,</HI> the rest was owing to your Companion <HI>Matt.</HI> the <HI>Tavern Boy,</HI> who was fain to carry Brains for his Master. <HI>Harry</HI> could hardly contain him∣self,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
but with a very cloudy Brow told him, he had neither Brains nor any other Merit to raise him above the Character of a <HI>Trickster:</HI> We know now, says he, why none but <HI>Cou∣sin Tom</HI> could be trusted at Mr. WRIGHT's; but thou wast ever a trimming, equivocal Rascal, and woo't so continue.</P>
<P><HI>Sim</HI> the <HI>Scrivener</HI> put in a word on the same side, whom <HI>Robin</HI> took up very smartly. As for your part, says <HI>Robin,</HI> did I not raise you from a <HI>Petifogger</HI> to be <HI>what you are, took you from writing hackney up and down, lent you Mo∣ney to pay your Debts, and help'd you to live like a Man, and you to conspire against me too: But by</HI> Jove, rapping his Knuckles upon the Ta∣ble, <HI>I'll make you all as poor and beggarly as I found you!</HI> Thou wert always a Trickster, reply'd <HI>Sim. I hated you before, but now I de∣spise you. Nab.</HI> too open'd her Quail pipe at <HI>Robin,</HI> but what she said is not recorded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widow</HI> heard all this with a Mixture of Grief and Surprize; but above all she won∣dered to hear them talk of a better <HI>Compositi∣on,</HI> when she had all along been told, <HI>it was a very good one;</HI> she plainly perceived now she had been trick'd, especially by <HI>Robin,</HI> who she declar'd, <HI>had not told her one word of truth from the beginning;</HI> so that <HI>Harry</HI> for the present seem'd to carry his <HI>Point. Robin</HI> was order'd to deliver up his Books, which were soon after given to the <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> one of the honestest Servants in the Family, which partly shew'd the Widow's good Disposition;
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
for as he was known to be very well affected to Mr. WRIGHT's Title, it shewed her own Inclination thereto, by pitching on a Person so very acceptable. This rejoic'd People strangely, and the more, because there had passed a current Rumour for some time, that they had been tampering with her to transfer the Estate to young <HI REND="blackletterType">Shute,</HI> after her Decease, contrary to Law. How true it is, God knows; but it seems they were disappointed. And I can assure you she told some of her Friends, that she had often repented the dismissing her old Ser∣vants, who had served her faithfully, and given Content to her Customers; and if it pleased God to grant her Life and Health, she would make a very great <HI>Alteration</HI> in Affairs.</P>
<P>But in short, what thro' the Grief and Fright she had conceiv'd at their unmannerly Behaviour before her, and the Anguish of a former Distemper, it threw the Pain into her Head with such Violence, that it soon put an end to her Life, for which the whole Town shew'd a general Concern, and la∣mented her as a pious, good, and charitable Woman, whom it may be truly said, <HI>they brought with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after she expir'd, the <HI>Tru∣stees</HI> took Possession of the <HI>Premises</HI> in Mr. WRIGHT's Name. I cannot describe the infinite Joy on this Occasion, and that won∣derful Satisfaction that appear'd in People's
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Countenances: All was acted with that Calmness and Unanimity, that Cheerful∣ness and Alacrity, as seemed plainly to prog∣nosticate our future Good: No one was wanting to do his part; nay, even the <HI>Par∣son of the Parish,</HI> tho' crazy with Age and Infirmities, yet appear'd abroad that Day to countenance Mr. WRIGHT's Title, being one of the <HI>Feofees</HI> in <HI>Trust</HI> for him.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Harry Aucumy,</HI> indeed, appear'd un∣der a very deep Pressure of Mind; not so much for the Loss of the <HI>Widow,</HI> as the sole Power and Grandeur he conceiv'd himself fallen from, and the Inconveniences his past Conduct might bring him into; for he knew in his Conscience he should find it a difficult Matter to acquit himself honestly to Mr. WRIGHT. This occasion'd a visible Alte∣ration in his Countenance, and poor <HI>Harry</HI> looked as queer and dejected as one of the Vulgar. He put himself in close <HI>Mourning,</HI> and exploded all Lewdness for nine Days, which you know is the ultimate Date of all Wonders, especially with <HI>Harry. John Squeamish,</HI> the Head-Tapster, a queer insig∣nificant Fellow of <HI>Bob</HI>'s preferring; <HI>Sam. Pe∣ticoat,</HI> the Warehouse keeper; <HI>Will. Wildfire, Harry</HI>'s Intimate; <HI>Dick,</HI> the Powder-Mon∣key, and <HI>Nab,</HI> his Sister, with some others, seem to lament with the same Humiliation and Concern the great Vicissitude of For∣tune.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
We expect our new <HI>Landlord</HI> with the ut∣most Impatience; and then you shall have a farther Account of what happens; assuring you, that this leaves us under the most pro∣mising Aspect of having our Affairs retriev'd again from the languishing Condition the last three Years had thrown them into; and perhaps you never saw a more visible Spirit of Joy than appears at present.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c.</SIGNED>

<P><LABEL>P.S.</LABEL> As I divined, poor <HI>Harry</HI> is dismiss'd from his <HI>Clerkship,</HI> by order of Mr. WRIGHT, and a Padlock clapp'd on the <HI>Counting-house:</HI> Just now I learn from a Friend, that his Ac∣counts are very confused, and occasion di∣vers Speculations.
