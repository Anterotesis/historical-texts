<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem does not pass any judgment upon the Pictures that are now exhibited in the Gallery; but attempts to point out new subjects for future Ex∣hibitions: And, in the delineation of new subjects, attention is paid to the principle laid down by our late great Painter, (in his notes to the translation of Fresnoy by Mr. MASON) <Q>That palpable situation is preferable to curious sentiment, as the Painter speaks to the eye.</Q></P>

<L>As mus'd the Prophet near mild CHEBAR's stream <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">EZEKIEL, Chap. 8th.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>And pray'd his God to dart th' enlight'ning gleam,</L>
<L>Abrupt-descending from his airy height,</L>
<L>A form angelic rufh's upon his sight!</L>
<L>With smiling lip he cheer'd the hallow'd Sire,</L>
<L>And bad his soul to Heav'n's best gift aspire:</L>
<L>Then, with strong hand, he grasp'd his silver hair,</L>
<L>And swift convey'd him thro' the yielding air,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7"/>Along the unknown region of the sky,</L>
<L>The dread, mysterious, deep abyss on high.</L>
<L>There Inspiration her bright cloud withdrew,</L>
<L>And pour'd her visions on his daring view:</L>
<L>Then on his rapture-kindled eye arose</L>
<L>Those forms of splendor, those terrific shows,</L>
<L>With which be peopled his celestial dream,</L>
<L>And swell'd his proud magnificence of theme.</L>
<L>To ENGLAND's Leading Bard thus Genius came,</L>
<L>Envelop'd in a robe of holy flame,</L>
<L>And bore him, with a whirlwind's rapid force,</L>
<L>Beyond the solar road, and starry course;</L>
<L>From which far tow'ring and tremendous height</L>
<L>(While now he hovers with suspended flight)</L>
<L>The Poet view'd, as on a spacious plain,</L>
<L>Of human passions the long shadowy train:</L>
<L>'Twas then the favor'd Bard receiv'd the lore,</L>
<L>(Whose mystic veil was ne'er remov'd before)</L>
<L>That revelation to his instinct giv'n,</L>
<L>That ray from GOD, the energy of Heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
<L>To his illumin'd sight was then consign'd</L>
<L>The deep recesses of the Human Mind;</L>
<L>The ever-varying path of tortuous Art,</L>
<L>And the dark passage to the Tyrant's heart;</L>
<L>Th'umbrageous winding of the thorny road,</L>
<L>That leads to quick-ey'd Jealousy's abode;</L>
<L>The gath'ring storms that o'er Resentment roll;</L>
<L>The swelling waves that toss the fearsul soul;</L>
<L>The calm that breathes around the Infant's rest,</L>
<L>The rugged cavern of the Murd'rer's breast;</L>
<L>The dread materials by the Furies brought,</L>
<L>With which are forg'd Despair's tempestuous thought;</L>
<L>The shaft, that, mingling pleasure with the pain,</L>
<L>Bathes in the blood that warms the Lover's vein.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh Thou! th' IMPERIAL GENIUS of our land!</L>
<L>Take a fresh garland from thy country's hand;</L>
<L>Triumphs unknown she hastens to proclaim,</L>
<L>And stamp a new-born era on thy fame!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9"/>Too long, as with the iron power of Fate,</L>
<L>Hath Custom bolted the Historic Gate;</L>
<L>Enlighten'd BOYDELL bursts th' opposing bar,</L>
<L>On their rude hinge the pond'rous portals jar;</L>
<L>While the rapt Arts salute, with loud acclaim,</L>
<L>This rich accession to their rising name.</L>
<L>Genius of PAINTING! thy bright car ascend,</L>
<L>Bid glowing Energy thy steps attend,</L>
<L>Triumphant ride thro' the unrifled land,</L>
<L>And seize thy plunder with victorious hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft have we heard the pure of taste complain,</L>
<L>Of mawkish Portraiture's eternal reign;</L>
<L>Of exhibitions which the art disgrace,</L>
<L>And pall the eye with many a vacant face.</L>
<L>Let Miniature erect her fairy school,</L>
<L>And'mid her gewgaws unmolested rule;</L>
<L>Let her bright dome each pleas'd Narcissus seek,</L>
<L>To her let Beauty hold her summer cheek!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="10"/>Let her delineate, on her iv'ry plane,</L>
<L>The nuptial simper of the happy swain!</L>
<L>From these we turn to scenes of higher aim,</L>
<L>Where Eagle-Genius soars to nobler game;</L>
<L>Where Fancy, Reason, Taste, in one conjoin'd,</L>
<L>Unfold the workings of th' impassion'd mind.</L>
<L>Now to the laurell'd, academic band.</L>
<L>To ev'ry Artist's emulative hand,</L>
<L>Munificence upholds her sacred prize,</L>
<L>And bids the daring reach it from the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While Expectation lifts the thought on high,</L>
<L>Methinks I view, with a prophetic eye,</L>
<L>In solemn state ascend that splendid Dome,</L>
<L>Where the proud Arts shall find an equal home;</L>
<L>Where, at the opening of some glorious day,</L>
<L>The English mind its treasures shall display;</L>
<L>While they, whose taste is sway'd by Rigor's rule,</L>
<L>Shall mark the wonders of the Albion School.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Another gallery is to be erected, for the purpose of receiving the whole collection, when complete.</NOTE></L>

<L>If time shou'd e'er obliterate the gold</L>
<L>Of SHAKSPEAR'S language, cast in Vigor's moul</L>
<L>Here shall, invested in their various guise,</L>
<L>The throng of his departed Forms arise!</L>
<L>The splendid forms his mind luxuriant drew,</L>
<L>The bold creations he held forth to view,</L>
<L>As from their grave shall burst the num'rous host,</L>
<L>And on these walls a new existence boast.</L>
<L>Here shall be seen, in all her charms array'd,</L>
<L>Th'impressive figure of VERONA'S Maid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JULIET.</NOTE>:</L>
<L>Clos'd in the dreary vault where sleep the dead,</L>
<L>Wrapp'd in the night-dress of the fun'ral bed,</L>
<L>She breaks abruptly from her iron trance,</L>
<L>And sends around a terror-rolling glance:</L>
<L>A mournful, solitary lamp shall throw</L>
<L>A sickly glimm'ring o'er the house of woe,</L>
<L>And shall the wretched PARIS give to view,</L>
<L>Stretch'd on the ground, with mien of ghastly hue:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12"/>Then shall a deeper spectacle display,</L>
<L>And hang o'er ROMEO with reluctant ray,</L>
<L>Disclosing his wan lips, devoid of breath,</L>
<L>And faint-ros'd cheek, still beautiful in death:</L>
<L>Then shall the beam, with weaken'd effort, shed</L>
<L>A fading glory on the FRIAR'S head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She too shall ornament the pictur'd scene,</L>
<L>The destin'd victim of ITALIAN spleen:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IMOGEN.</NOTE></L>
<L>See the base wretch perform his treach'rous part,</L>
<L>With all the subtlety of finish'd art!</L>
<L>Behold him bending o'er the sleeping Maid,</L>
<L>Her holy form to his research betray'd!</L>
<L>Eager some secret notice to retail,</L>
<L>With rav'nous aim he lifts the slender veil,</L>
<L>And leering marks, by Nature's hand imprest,</L>
<L>The mole cinque-spotted on her snowy breast;</L>
<L>Whose scatter'd drops to the rapt eye excel</L>
<L>The crimson spots within the cowslip's bell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
<L>Here too, as patient as the meek-ey'd dove,</L>
<L>Shall stand the Maid who "never told her love <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">VIOLA.</NOTE>"</L>
<L>Who, to her coy and fearful bosom true,</L>
<L>(As th' unseen worm, that pales the blossom's hue)</L>
<L>Still let concealment on her beauty prey,</L>
<L>Like snow dissolving silently away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, at the magic Painter's wild command,</L>
<L>Girt with the sea, ascends th' Enchanted Land!</L>
<L>There stands Simplicity's endearing Child <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">MIRANDA.</NOTE></L>
<L>That artless Maid! the flow'ret of the wild!</L>
<L>Beside the margin of the wave-vex'd shore,</L>
<L>While all around conflicting thunders roar,</L>
<L>With unbound tresses, flutt'ring to the wind,</L>
<L>Her eye expressive of her tortur'd mind,</L>
<L>She views the vessel, by the surges tost,</L>
<L>Now seen—now lost—now found—now once more lost:</L>
<L>Till, madly rushing on the pointed rock,</L>
<L>Its bosom riven with the forceful shock,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="14"/>Beyond the stretch of naval art to save,</L>
<L>Down, down, it hurries to the watery grave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now PROSPERO comes, with magic arts endu'd,</L>
<L>His sable garb with hieroglyphics strew'd;</L>
<L>Long care, long study, solitude profound,</L>
<L>Has deepen'd on his brow reflection's wound;</L>
<L>His low-descending hair, o'erblanch'd with age,</L>
<L>Becomes the Sorc'rer, and adorns the Sage:</L>
<L>Ah! view him at that dread, momentous hour,</L>
<L>While he abjures his necromantic pow'r!</L>
<L>Within the ring of Incantation's ground,</L>
<L>Elves, Fairies, Spirits, Demons, flock around:</L>
<L>Beneath his foot behold the potent wand,</L>
<L>Doom'd ne'er again to grace his lifted hand!</L>
<L>Behold the volume, which (with myst'ry fraught)</L>
<L>Predestination's darkling edicts taught,</L>
<L>And breath'd its solemn whispers on the mind,</L>
<L>With dust o'erspread, and to neglect consign'd!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="15"/>Yet then the distant scenery imparts</L>
<L>A dire remembrance of his former arts:</L>
<L>The bright sun fading in his full career,</L>
<L>The wild stars madly starting from their sphere,</L>
<L>The storm-encumber'd sky, the swelling main,</L>
<L>Th' uprooted cedars stretching o'er the plain,</L>
<L>The mountain loosen'd by convulsive throe,</L>
<L>With ruin rushing to the vale below,</L>
<L>And the pale wretch, reversing Nature's doom,</L>
<L>Abruptly rising from the risted tomb!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What glowing Artist with bold hand shall claim</L>
<L>To draw, Oh ARIEL! thy resplendent frame?</L>
<L>Thou tricksy Spirit with benignant smile,</L>
<L>Thou playful meteor of th' Enchanted Isle!</L>
<L>Not like a sea-nymph, rob'd in sickly green,</L>
<L>With dappled wings, as on the Stage thou'rt seen,</L>
<L>A gay transparency shalt thou appear,</L>
<L>Thy form celestial melting into air,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="16"/>With foot light-touching some fantastic height,</L>
<L>Prompt to depart, and stretching to thy flight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, ere we sail from this Enchanted Isle,</L>
<L>Let other scenes our ling'ring steps beguile:</L>
<L>There stands ANTHONIO, the suggesting fiend,</L>
<L>And half reveals his purpose to his friend;</L>
<L>His bosom swells, his madd'ning eye-balls roll,</L>
<L>And shew the workings of his inmost soul.</L>
<L>All that his lawless, wild conceptions dare,</L>
<L>In various forms hang hov'ring in the air:</L>
<L>A sword fresh-tainted with ALONZO'S blood,</L>
<L>A sceptre swimming in a cimson flood,</L>
<L>A crown with dazzling ornaments o'erspread,</L>
<L>And lightly floating o'er SEBASTIAN'S head;</L>
<L>While, in the distance, rising o'er the bay,</L>
<L>Imperial Naples shall her tow'rs display.</L>

<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<L>Lo! now, advancing on the mimic scene,</L>
<L>Comes forth to view the fam'd Egyptian Queen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ANTHONY AND CLEOPATRA, Act ist, Scence 3d, at the end.</NOTE>;</L>
<L>While anxious doubts her Soldier's mind perplex,</L>
<L>Behold her rise instructive to her sex!</L>
<L>Ah, not superior! for the female heart</L>
<L>Endures with fortitude the suff'ring part.</L>
<L>Tow'ring beyond the flight of tim'rous love,</L>
<L>She bids her Warrior from her sight remove;</L>
<L>She points her finger to the martial plain,</L>
<L>Points to the active and the daring train:</L>
<L>The threat'ning axes which the Fasces bear;</L>
<L>The gorgeous streamers swelling to the air;</L>
<L>Of busy legions the thick murm'ring swarms;</L>
<L>The thronging shields, and high emblazon'd arms;</L>
<L>Th' encumbering elephant, the rapid steed,</L>
<L>And spoils of former conquest, Glory's meed;</L>
<L>Flush'd Conquest, riding in his trophied car,</L>
<L>And all the dread magnificence of war.</L>

<L>(Such the hot chaos of his mental state)</L>
<L>The air-born dagger, and display to view</L>
<L>The point obscene, distain'd with crimson hue.</L>

<L>Still, as we gaze, shall new creations rise,</L>

<HEAD>THE RISE AND FALL OF THE <HI>NORTHERN POETRY:</HI> A POEM, IN TWO PARTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="dedication">
<PB REF="41"/>
<HEAD>TO THE EARL of ORFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ambitious of inscribing this Poem to you, as a small return for the warm commendation you be∣stoed upon it, when the Poem was first published. This also gives me an opportunity, which I readily embrace, of paying a public testimony to the exalted regard with which I remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your faithful humble servant, <HI>EDWARD JERNINGHAM.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE materials that form the First Part of the following Poem are taken from the Scandinavian poetics, The EDDA! In the remarks on the third fable of the Edda, are these words, <Q>A powerful Being had with his breath animated the drops out of which the first giant was formed. This Being, whom the Edda affects not to name, was entirely distinct from Odin, who had his birth long after the formation of the giant Ymir.</Q>—This first agent, or Genius, whom the Edda affects not to name, is supposed, in the following Poem, to create, from his own immediate power, the system of the Scaldic mythology. As it would have been impossible to introduce the whole system without running into a te∣dious enumeration, the principal features of it are only re∣tained, sufficient (it is presumed) to give some idea of the character of the northern poetry. Among other omissions, the reader will find that no mention is made of <HI>Gimlé,</HI> the mansion of bliss, that was appropriated to the reception of the virtuous, nor of <HI>Nastrande,</HI> the abode of the impious; these places not being supposed to exist in their full extent till the general destruction of the world; whereas the hall of Odin, and the caves of Hela, were peculiarly the Elysium and the Tartarus of the Runic poetry: they are perpetually referred to in the ancient songs of the Scalds, and the wild system of these contrasted abodes seems well calculated to encourage
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>that spirit of war and enterprize which runs through the whole Scandinavian minstrelsy.</P>
<P>Some expressions taken from the Edda may appear obscure without an explanation.—In the language of the Scalds, the world is stiled the great vessel that floats on the ages.—The rainbow, the bridge of the gods.—To drink the blood of friendship, alludes to a ceremony performed by two warriors when they enter into an alliance of friendship; they made in∣cisions in their arms or breast, and tasting each other's blood, they mutually swore, that the death of the first of them who fell in battle should not pass unrevenged.</P>
<P>To celebrate the mass of weapons, was to fight against the Christians, whose religious sentiments the Scandavians held in contempt, as thinking them adverse to the spirit of war.</P>
<P>The Valkeries are a female troop, whom Odin sends to the field of battle upon invisible steeds; their function is to choose such as are destined to slaughter, and conduct their spirits to the Paradise of the Brave.</P>
<P>Fenris is a large wolf, who is to break his chains at the general conflagration, and to swallow the sun.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN urg'd by Destiny th' eventful year</L>
<L>Sail'd thro' the portal of the northern sphere,</L>
<L>Of SCANDINAVIA the rude Genius rose,</L>
<L>His breast deep-lab'ring with creation's throes:</L>
<L>Thrice o'er his head a pow'rful wand he whirl'd,</L>
<L>Then call'd to life a new Poetic world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First thro' the yawning waves that roar'd around,</L>
<L>Uprising slow from out the gulph profound,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="45"/>Amidst the fury of the beating storm</L>
<L>The giant YMIR heav'd his horrid form.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now on the stormy cloud the rainbow glows,</L>
<L>Where gay Diversity her colouring throws.</L>
<L>Beyond the sun the Pow'r now cast his eyes,</L>
<L>And bade the splendid city ASGARD ise;</L>
<L>Obedient to the loud creative call</L>
<L>She rises, circled with a crystal wall,</L>
<L>Her sapphire mansions crown'd with opal tow'rs,</L>
<L>O'er which the Pow'r a flood of radiance show'rs.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now a more daring task the Genius plann'd,</L>
<L>He seiz'd the rapid lightning in his hand,</L>
<L>And as around the broken rays he flung,</L>
<L>From the fall'n spires the gods of ASGARD sprung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See the dread Ash exalt its lofty head,</L>
<L>And o'er a wide extent its umbrage shed:</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="46"/>There twelve of ASGARD's gods in close divan</L>
<L>Sit in strict judgment on the deeds of man:</L>
<L>Amidst the waving boughs enthron'd on high</L>
<L>An eagle sends around his watchful eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three virgin forms, in snowy vests array'd,</L>
<L>Stand in the deep recesses of the shade,</L>
<L>The rich endowments of whose radiant mind</L>
<L>Are by the Pow'r to different acts consign'd.</L>
<L>He gives to thee, sage URDA, to restore</L>
<L>The splendid deeds of times that are no more,</L>
<L>And (faithful as the echo to the sound)</L>
<L>Repeat transactions that were once renown'd.</L>
<L>Clear to thy view, VERNANDI, are unfurl'd</L>
<L>The various scenes that fill the extensive world.</L>
<L>To thee, O SKULDA, the dread pow'r is giv'n,</L>
<L>To read the counsels in the breast of heav'n;</L>
<L>With daring forecast pierce th' abyss of time,</L>
<L>And (utt'ring first some strange mysterious rhyme)</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="47"/>Proclaim which babe, when rear'd to warlike form,</L>
<L>Shall o'er his country roll deftruction's storm;</L>
<L>And which, directed to a better fate,</L>
<L>Shall rise the pride and pillar of the state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, at the awful Pow'r's commanding call,</L>
<L>Arose to view great ODIN'S festive hall!</L>
<L>Engrav'd with sun-beams on the crystal gate</L>
<L>Appear'd—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>—<HI>Here they refude in splendid state,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who, as they slept in death, reclin'd their head</HI></L>
<L><HI>On valour's bier, the battle's rugged bed,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who to the bliss th' intrepid claim aspir'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who welcom'd pain, and with a smile expir'd.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now as the Genius waves his hallow'd hand</L>
<L>The Valkeries appear, a female band,</L>
<L>Prompt to the storm of lances to repair,</L>
<L>On viewless steeds to scour the fields of air,</L>
<L><PB N="47" REF="48"/>Mark as they hover o'er the crowded plain</L>
<L>The chosen chiefs, the death-devoted train.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Pow'r now form'd the coward's dwelling-place,</L>
<L>The seat of pain, and mansion of disgrace:</L>
<L>Deep under earth he fix'd the drear abode,</L>
<L>Thro' which the rueful stream of anguish flow'd;</L>
<L>Loud roar the surges thro' the gulph profound,</L>
<L>While cavern'd echoes murmur back the sound.</L>
<L>Close at the gate sat Death's terrific Maid,</L>
<L>Her meagre form in sable weeds array'd;</L>
<L>Awreath of living snakes entwine her head,</L>
<L>And thus with shrilling voice the spectre said:</L>
<L>'Haste to my caves, ye impotent of heart,</L>
<L>'Who meanly shrink from valour's daring part,</L>
<L>'Ye too, who ling'ring on with feeble breath,</L>
<L>'Crept thro' the languor of old age to death.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See on the horrid battle's bleeding plain</L>
<L>The raven-brood rejoicing o'er the slain!</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="49"/>Yet then in vain they gorge the grateful food,</L>
<L>Death smites them at the dire repast of blood;</L>
<L>When lo! their pinions to the wond'ring view</L>
<L>Combining, into one vast texture grew;</L>
<L>The gory heads conjoin'd in one dread fold,</L>
<L>Around the frame a grisly margin roll'd:</L>
<L>Now self-upborne the sable banner flings</L>
<L>Bold to the wind its wide-expanding wings;</L>
<L>'Exalt', the Genius cries, 'thy plumes on high,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from a rock on which the Genius stood,</L>
<L>He mark'd below a slowly-waving wood,</L>
<L>Then rais'd his awful voice—'Hail, hallow'd gloom,</L>
<L>'(Where Thought is rear'd, and Fancy decks her plume)</L>

<L>'Twas then the Pow'r resum'd—'Ye chosen band,</L>

<P>The temple of UPSAL was destroyed by INGO, 1075—a Christian cathedral was erected on its ruins fourscore years after. At the introduction of Christianity, the interposition of angels and the appearance of ghosts grew familiar to the SCANDINAVIAN poetry, which was afterwards enriched by allegories, and by the accession of new images, which flowed to it through various channels, particularly from the East.—<HI>See</HI> RICHARDSON's <HI>Differtation.</HI></P>
<P>When colleges were founded, and the general attention was directed to classical learning, the wild conceptions of the Scaldic minstrels gradually fell into disuse.—This short Analysis contains the subject of the following pages.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="note">
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Monastery of CLUNI, from whence ABELARD is supposed to write the following Epistle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Mascon, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was dis∣tinguished for his learning and humanity. History elevates him above the vulgar herd of monks, by the appellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the censure of the court of Rome.</P>
<P>SAINT BERNARD also is connected with the story of Pa∣raclete. This great man stands eminently forward in the pic∣ture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations, he rushed into the tumult of active life, and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that pe∣riod. With an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his cha∣racter, he precipitated his country into that ruinous measure, the second crusade. Behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all EUROPE in suspence, which ex∣hibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpowered the pre∣tensions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was seated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot ne∣ver impeached his moral character; but it must be allowal
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions, he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel.</P>
<P>ABELARD in the following Epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest cala∣mity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, suspend∣ed their endearing offices, and withdrew from the degraded offender.</P>
<P>THE following Poem has been distinguished by a beautiful sonnet, inserted in a volume of Poems that does honour to mo∣dera poetry, by Mr. Taylor, a gentleman whose commenda∣tion is a passport to Fame, except where it is directed (as in the present intlance) by the amiable bias of friendship.</P>

<P>In endeavouring to display the good and bad effects occasioned by Enthusiasm, I might have drawn many signal instances from that inexhaustible mine, the Greek and Roman story; but it appeared to me more eli∣gible to work upon materials hewn from the modern quarry only: the subject, thus treated, I conceived would come more home to the feelings of the reader.

<P>The following Lines were addressed to the late Lady HERVEY, mother of the Earl of BRISTOL, a lady dis∣tinguished for her erudition and refined taste. Her house was the receptacle of elegance and celebrity, and was a kind of passport to fame. Our Author was fortunate in an early introduction to a Lady, on whose list of ac∣quaintance were found the names of LYTTLETON, CHESTERFIELD, MELCOMBE, MARCHMONT, MANS∣FIELD, BOLINGBROKE, HUME, GARRICK, &amp;c. And he has mentioned to us, with a recollective complacency, his having basked (to use his own expression) in the sun-set of those eminent personages.—<HI>Note of the Editor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ARGARET OF ANJOU, AN HISTORICAL INTERLUDE.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Historical Interlude is formed upon the plan that ROUSSEAU composed his PYGMALION, which is a new spe∣cies of Dramatic Entertainment, consisting chiefly of a mono∣logue, that is often suspended by the interposition of music.</P>
<P>The following little Drama was written for (that ornament of the Stage) Mrs. POPE, who performed it on the night of her benefit. This Interlude has also been performed at BRAN∣DENBURGH House: the part of MARGARET received from the theatrical abilities of her Serene Highness the Margravine the richest colouring and the most impressive truth of ex∣pression.</P>
<P>The subject is taken from a remarkable incident in the life of MARGARET.—That unfortunate Queen, flying with her Son into a forest after the battle of HEXHAM, saw a Robber approach with his naked sword; and finding that she had no means of escaping, she suddenly embraced the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his generosity. The man,
<PB N="141" REF="139"/>whose humanity and generous spirit had been obscured, not entirely lost, by his vicious course of life, was struck with the singularity of the event, and charmed with the confidence re∣posed in him; and he vowed not only to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stain from all injury against the Queen, <Q>but to devote himself entirely to her safety and protection. <BIBL>HUME.</BIBL></Q></P>
