<HEAD>THE Roguish MILLER;
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
OR, Nothing got by Cheating.
A TRUE BALLAD.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>A Miller there was, and he liv'd at his Mill,</L>
<L>Which was built on a stream at the foot of a hill.</L>
<L>He cheated all day and he drank all the night,</L>
<L>For cheating and drinking was all his delight;</L>
<L>While his moments in tippling unheeded did roll,</L>
<L>This still was his saying—be sure to take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whoever sent corn to be ground at his Mill,</L>
<L>He spoilt it, he chang'd it, he pilfer'd it still;</L>
<L>In villainy thus a long course he did run,</L>
<L>For he fancy'd that cheating was very good fun.</L>
<L>He car'd not what came of his body or soul,</L>
<L>While this was his saying—I'll always take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you sent a full Sack of good corn to his Mill,</L>
<L>A Sack of bad flour he sent you back still,</L>
<L>For he fancy'd that when he the wheat had once ground,</L>
<L>The difference wou'd not be easily found:</L>
<L>Now to change good for bad was as if he had stole,</L>
<L>And he not only chang'd it—but always took toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Neighbours oft sent him their Money to pay,</L>
<L>But he always refus'd it and sent it away;</L>
<L>Had he taken the Money he'd have got but his due,</L>
<L>But the payment that's lawful for him wou'd not do;</L>
<L>What was honestly his he despis'd on the whole,</L>
<L>Because he got more from—the taking of toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One day when a Farmer had sent a good sack</L>
<L>Of his Corn to be ground, and then sent for it back;</L>
<L>He call'd to his Man and demanded straitway,</L>
<L>If for this he had taken the toll on that day.</L>
<L>The Man strait declar'd, that tho' nought he had stole,</L>
<L>Yet that he had taken—the full of the toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He then call'd his maid, and he ask'd her good lack</L>
<L>If toll she had taken from that very sack;</L>
<L>She declar'd that she had, but he fond of pelf,</L>
<L>Said, for fear that you shou'd not, I'll take it myself;</L>
<L>So rashly he ventur'd the loss of his Soul,</L>
<L>And mended his practice—by thrice taking toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length he grew bolder and bolder in sin,</L>
<L>And cheating he deeper and deeper got in;</L>
<L>Of Satan, alas! he was quite at the beck,</L>
<L>Where he first took a pound he at length took a peck,</L>
<L>No church he frequented to pray for his Soul,</L>
<L>Who wou'd might go thither—so he could take toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Farmer, the Squire, the Parson likewise</L>
<L>Agreed to observe him with still keener Eyes;</L>
<L>But the Justice he cheated to such a degree,</L>
<L>That no longer with patience his frauds cou'd he see;</L>
<L>So he sent him to jail by the LAW's just controul,</L>
<L>And a MITTIMUS paid him—for taking of toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come all honest Millers whoever you be,</L>
<L>And listen to counsel that's given by me;</L>
<L>Be content, like fair tradesmen with moderate gains,</L>
<L>And look for a lawful reward of your pains;</L>
<L>If 'tis paid you in money be pleas'd on the whole</L>
<L>And if you take any—take moderate toll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! seek not each way to defraud that you can,</L>
<L>Nor cheat in the flour, nor cheat in the bran;</L>
<L>Be honest and all Men will flock to your Mill,</L>
<L>And tho' others want custom, yours ne'er will stand still.</L>
<L>And when to your MAKER you give up your soul,</L>
<L>You'll rejoice that you always—took moderate toll.</L>
