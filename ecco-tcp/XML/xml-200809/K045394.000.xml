<HEAD>A DIALOGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES STOCK and his journeyman Will Simp∣son, as I informed my Readers in the Second Part of the Two Shoemakers, had resolved to work together one hour every evening in order to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for Tommy Williams's schooling. This circum∣stance brought them to be a good deal together when the rest of the men were gone home. Now it happened that Mr. Stock had a mighty way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> endeavouring to turn all common events to some use; and he thought it right on the present occa¦sion to make the only return in his power to Will Simpson for his great kindness. "For," said he "if Will gives up so much of his time to hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to provide for this poor boy, it is the least can do to try to turn part of that time to the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pose of promoting Will's spiritual good." No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as the bent of Stock's own mind was religious, was easy to him to lead their talk to somethin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> profitable. He always took especial care how¦ever, that the subject should be introduced pro¦perly, cheerfully, and without constraint. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>well knew that great good may be sometimes done by a prudent attention in seizing proper opportu∣nities, so he knew that the cause of piety had been sometimes hurt by forcing serious subjects where here was clearly no disposition to receive them. say he had found out that two things were neces∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary to the promoting of Religion among his friends; warm zeal to be always on the watch for occa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions, and a cool judgment to distinguish which vas the right time and place to make use of them. To know <HI>how</HI> to do good is a great matter, but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>now <HI>when</HI> to do it is no small one.</P>
<P>Simpson was an honest good-natured fellow; he was now become sober, and rather religiously dis∣posed. But he was ignorant, he did not know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch of the grounds of Religion, or of the cor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uption of his own nature; he was regular at Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut was first drawn thither rather by his skill in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>salm-singing than by any great devotion. He had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eft off going to the Greyhound, and often read the Bible or some other good book on the Sunday <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vening. This he thought was quite enough; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought the Bible was the prettiest history book in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he world, and that Religion was a very good thing or Sundays. But he did not much understand what business people had with it on working days. He had left off drinking because it had brought Williams to the grave, and his wise to dirt and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ags; but not because he himself had seen the evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f sin. He now considered swearing and Sabbath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaking as scandalous and indecent, but he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot found out that both were to be left off because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are highly offensive to GOD, and grieve his Holy Spirit. As Simpson was less self-conceited
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>than most ignorant people are, Stock had alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good hope that when he should come to be be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ter acquainted with the word of GOD, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the evil of his own heart, he would become o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> day a good Christian. The great hindrance w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that he fancied himself so already.</P>
<P>One evening Simpson had been calling to Stock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mind how disorderly the house and shop, when they were now sitting quietly at work, had for∣merly been, and he went on thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comfortably we live now master to what we used to do in Williams's time! I used then never to be happy but when we were keep¦ing it up all night, but now I am as merry as the day is long. I find I am twice as happy since I am grown good and sober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you are happy, Will, and I re∣joice that you are sober; but I would not have yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take too much pride in your own goodness for fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it should become a sin, almost as great as some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those you have left off. Besides, I would not have you make quite so sure that you <HI>are</HI> good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not good master! why don't you find me regular and orderly at work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much so, and accordingly I have a great respect for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pay every one his own, seldom miss Church, have not been drunk since Williams died have handsome cloaths for Sundays, and save <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trifle every week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true. And to all this you may add that you very generously work an hour, for poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tommy's education, every evening without fee o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well master, what can a man do more▪
<PB N="5" REF="5"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all this is not being good, I don't know what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>All these things are very right as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey go, and you could not well be a Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout doing them. But I shall make you stare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps when I tell you, you may do all these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings and many more, and yet be no Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Christian! surely master I do hope that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter all I have done, you will not be so unkind as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say I am no Christian?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOD forbid that I should say so Will. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope better things of you. But come now, what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o you think it is to be a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! why to be christened when one is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hild, to learn the Catechism when one can read, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be confirmed when one is a youth, and to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church when one is a man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are all very proper things, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite necessary. They make a part of a Christian's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se. But for all that, a man may be exact in them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and yet not be a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not be a Christian! ha! ha! ha! you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery comical master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, I am very serious, Will. At is rate it would be a very easy thing to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hristian, and every man who went through certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms would be a good man; and one man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oserved these forms would be as good as another. Whereas, if we come to examine ourselves by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord of GOD, I am afraid there are but few com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ratively whom our Saviour would allow to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Christians. What is your notion of a Chris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an's practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he must not rob nor murder, nor
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>get drunk. He must avoid scandalous things, and do as other decent orderly people do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is easy enough to be what the world calls a Christian, but not to be what the Bible calls so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, master, we working men are not ex∣pected to be saints, and martyrs, and apostles, and ministers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not. And yet Will, there ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not two sorts of Christianity; we are called to prac¦tise the same Religion which they practised, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> something of the same spirit is expected in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which we reverence in them. It was not sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and martyrs only to whom our Saviour said tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they must "crucify the world with it's affection and lusts." We are called to "be holy" in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> measure and degree, "as he who hath called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is holy." It was not only saints and martyrs w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> were told that they must be "like-minded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ"—That "they must do all to the glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God"—That they must renounce the spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world, and deny themselves." It was not to apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> only that Christ said "they must have their co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦versation in Heaven." It was not to a few ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> men set apart for the altar that he said "they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set their affections on things above"—That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> "must not be conformed to the world."—"No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was to Fishermen, to Publicans, to Farmers, to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> labourers, to poor Tradesmen that he spoke wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he told them they must love not the world nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things of the world"—"That they must renou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the hidden things of dishonesty, grow in grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up for themselves treasures in Heaven."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this might be very proper for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be taught, because they had not been bred
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>Christians, but Heathens or Jews: and Christ wanted to make them his followers, that is, Chris∣tians. But thank God we do not want to be taught <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll this, for we <HI>are</HI> Christians, born in a Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountry, of Christian parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose then you fancy that Christianity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omes to people in a Christian country by nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it comes by a good education or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good example. When a fellow who has got any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense sees a man cut off in his prime by drinking, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think he will begin to leave it off. When he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees another man respected, like you master, for ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty and sobriety, and going to Church, why he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill grow honest and sober and go to Church; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he will see it is his advantage to be a Chris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will, What you say is the truth, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not the whole truth. You are right as far as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, but you do not go far enough. The worldly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvantages of piety, are as you suppose, in gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l great. Credit, prosperity, and health, almost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aturally attend on a religious life, both because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> religious life supposes a sober and industrious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe; and because a man who lives in a course of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aty puts himself in the way of God's blessing. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a true Christian has a still higher aim in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew, and will follow Religion even under cir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mstances, when it may hurt his credit and ruin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s prosperity, if it should ever happen to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of God that he should be brought into such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, master, to speak the truth, if I go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church on Sundays, and follow my work in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e week, I must say I think that is being good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, that he who does both
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>gives the best outward signs that he is good. But our going to Church, and even reading the Bible, are no proofs that we are as good as we need be, but rather that we do both these in order to make us better than we are. We do both on Sundays, as means by God's blessing to make us better all the week. We are to bring the fruits of that Chapter or of that Sermon into our daily life, and try to get our inmost heart and secret thoughts, as well as our daily conduct, amended by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sure master, you won't be so un∣reasonable as to want a body to be religious always? I can't do that neither. I'm not such a hypocrite as to pretend to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you can in every action of your life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What master, always to be thinking about Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, far from it Will; much less to be always talking about it. But you must be always acting under it's power and spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely 'tis pretty well if I do this when I go to Church; or while I am saying my prayers. Even you master, as strict as you are, would not have me always on my knees, nor always at Church I suppose: for then how would your work be carried on, and how would our town be supplied with shoes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Will. 'Twould be no proof of our Religion to let our customers go barefoot; but 'twould be a proof of our laziness, and we should starve as we ought to do. The business of the world must not only be carried on, but carried on with spirit and activity. We have the same authority for not being "slothful in business as we have for being fervent in spirit." Religion has
<PB N="9" REF="9"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Godliness and laziness as wide asunder as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wo things in the world; and what God has sepa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated, let no man pretend to join. Indeed, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirit of religion can have no fellowship with sloth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dolence, and self-indulgence. But still, a Chris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an does not carry on his common trade quite like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nother man neither. For something of the spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich he labours to attain at Church, he carries <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith him into his worldly concerns. While there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re some who set up for Sunday Christians, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave no notion that they are bound to be Week∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay Christians too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, master, I do think, if God Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contented with one day in seven, he won't thank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou for throwing him the other six into the bargain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought he gave us them for our own use; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m sure nobody works harder all the week than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>God, it is true, sets apart one day in even for actual rest from labour, and for more im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ediate devotion to his service. But shew me that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext, wherein he says, thou shalt love the Lord thy God on <HI>Sundays</HI>—Thou shalt keep my command∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents on the <HI>Sabbath Day</HI>—To be carnally minded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Sundays, is death</HI>—Cease to do evil, and learn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o do well <HI>one day in seven</HI>—Grow in grace on the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>—Is there any such text?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure there is not; for that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e encouraging sin in all the other days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, just as you do when you make Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gion a thing for the Church and not for the world. There is no one lawful calling in pursuing which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay not serve GOD acceptably. You and I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve him while we are stitching this pair of Boots. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armer Furrow, while he is plowing yonder field.
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>Betsy West, over the way, whilst she is nursing her sick mother. Neighbour Incle, in measuring out him tapes and ribbons. I say, all these may serve God just as acceptably in those employments as at Church, I had almost said more so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, indeed—how can that be? Now you're too much on t'other side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because a man's trials in trade being often greater, they give him fresh means of glorifying God, and proving the sincerity of his religion. A man, who mixes in business, is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties. These will lead him, if he be a good man, to look more to GOD, than he perhaps would otherwise do. He sees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are snares all around him, this makes him watchful; he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him, this makes him humble himself; while a sense of his own difficulties make him tender to the failings of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you would make one believe, after all, that trade and business must be sinful in itself since it brings a man into all these snares and scrapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Will; trade and business don't create evil passions—they were in the heart before —Only now and then they seem to lie snug a little∣our concerns with the world bring them out into ac∣tion a little more, and thus shew both others and ourselves what we really are. But then, as the world offers more trials on the one hand, so on the other it holds out more duties. If we are called to battle oftener, we have more opportunities o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> victory. Every temptation resisted, is an enemy subdued; and he that ruleth his own spirit, is better than he that taketh a city.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't quite understand you, master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try to explain myself. There is no assion more called out by the transactions of trade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an covetousness. Now, 'tis impossible to with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and such a master sin as that, without carrying a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood deal of the spirit of religion into one's trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own I don't yet see how I am to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e religious when I'm hard at work, or busy settling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n account. I can't do two things at once; 'tis as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f I were to pretend to make a shoe and cut out a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot at the same moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you both must subsist together. Nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he one must be the motive to the other. GOD commands us to be industrious, and if we love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, the desire of pleasing him should be the main <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring of our industry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't see how I can always be thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout pleasing GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose, now, a man had a wife and chil∣dren whom he loved, and wished to serve, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot he be often thinking about them while he was at work? and though he would not be <HI>always</HI> think∣ing about them, yet would not the very love he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bore them be a constant spur to his industry? He would always be pursuing the same course from the same motive, though his words and even his thoughts must often be taken up in the common transactions of life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I say first one, then the other; now for labour, now for religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will shew that both must go together. I will suppose you were going to buy so many skins of our currier—that is quite a worldly transaction —you can't see what a spirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves' skins. Now, I tell you
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>it has a great deal to do with it. Covetousness, a desire to make a good bargain, may rise up in your heart. Selfishness, a spirit of monopoly, a wish to get all, in order to distress others; these are evil desires, and must be subdued. Some opportunity of unfair gain offers, in which there may be much sin, and yet little scandal. Here a Christian will stop short; he will recollect, that "he who maketh haste to be rich shall hardly be innocent." Per∣haps the sin may be on the side of your dealer—<HI>be</HI> may want to overreach <HI>you</HI>—this is provoking—you are tempted to violent anger, perhaps to swear— Here is a fresh demand on you for a spirit of pa∣tience and moderation, as there was before for a spirit of justice and self-denial. If, by God's grace, you get the victory over these temptations, you are the better man for having been called out to them. Always provided, that the temptation be not of your own seeking. If you give way, and sink un∣der these temptations, don't go and say that trade and business have made you covetous, passionate, and prosane. No, no; depend upon it, you were so before; you would have had all these evil seeds lurking in your heart, if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing, with the addi∣tional sin of idleness into the bargain. When you are busy, the devil often tempts you; when you are idle, you tempt the devil. If business and the world call these evil tempers into action, business and the world call that Religion into action too which teaches us to resist them. And in this you see the Week-day fruit of the Sunday's piety. 'Tis trade and business in the Week which call us to put our Sunday readings, praying, and Church, going into practice.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Master, you have a comical way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome how, of coming over one. I never should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave thought there would have been any religion vanted in buying and selling a few calves' skins. But, I begin to see there is a good deal in what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou say.—And, whenever I am doing a common ac∣tion, I will try to remember that it must be done 'after a Godly sort."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear the clock strike nine—let us leave off our work. I will only observe farther, that one good end of our bringing Religion into our busi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess is, to put us in mind not to undertake more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usiness than we can carry on consistently with our Religion. I shall never commend that man's dili∣gence, though it is often commended by the world, who is not diligent about the salvation of his soul. We are as much forbidden to be overcharged with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>cares</HI> of life as with it's <HI>pleasures.</HI> I only wish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prove to you, that a discreet Christian may be wise for both worlds; that he may employ his hands without entangling his soul, and labour for the heat that perisheth without neglecting that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndureth unto eternal life; that he may be prudent or time, while he is wise for eternity.</P>
