<HEAD>TO DAVID GARRICK, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is scarcely possible that any one should entertain a more humble opinion of the following little Production, than she who presents it to you. It is a trifle which, she confesses, has but a very slender claim to your protection; but she considers that your Name will be an ornament to her Book, as your Friendship has been an ho∣nour to its Author.</P>
<P>Where merit is incontestible, and cha∣racters are decided by the concurring suf∣frage of mankind, praise becomes almost impertinent. It is absurd to be industrious in proving truths so self-evident, that no one ever thought of controverting them.</P>
<P>I may be accused of advancing a start∣ling proposition, when I declare that you are an enemy to the Muses; but if it be allowed that description and invention are
<PB REF="3"/>
the very soul of Poetry, I shall be justified by the world in general, who constantly behold you displaying talents which cannot be described, and exhibiting excellencies which leave nothing to be imagined.</P>
<P>Whatever reason I may find to regret my having ventured these little Poems in∣to the world, I shall at least have no com∣mon pleasure in recollecting one circum∣stance attending them, since they furnish me with an occasion of assuring you with what esteem and admiration I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most obedient, and very humble Servant, HANNAH MORE.</SIGNED>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>There was a young, and valiant Knight,</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED was his name,</L>
<L>And never did a worthier wight</L>
<L>The rank of knighthood claim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where gliding <HI>Tay</HI> her stream sends forth,</L>
<L>To crown the neighbouring wood,</L>
<L>The antient glory of the North,</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED's castle stood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The youth was rich as youth might be</L>
<L>In patrimonial dower;</L>
<L>And many a noble feat had he</L>
<L>Atchiev'd, in hall, and bower.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He did not think, as some have thought,</L>
<L>Whom honour never crown'd,</L>
<L>The fame a father dearly bought,</L>
<L>Cou'd make the son renown'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>He better thought, a noble sire,</L>
<L>Who gallant deeds had done,</L>
<L>To deeds of hardihood shou'd fire</L>
<L>A brave and gallant son.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The fairest ancestry on earth</L>
<L>Without desert is poor;</L>
<L>And every deed of lofty worth</L>
<L>Is but a tax for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIR ELDRED's heart was good and kind,</L>
<L>Alive to Pity's call;</L>
<L>A croud of virtues grac'd his mind,</L>
<L>He lov'd, and felt for all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>merit</HI> rais'd the sufrerer's name,</L>
<L>He <HI>doubly</HI> serv'd him <HI>then;</HI></L>
<L>And those who cou'd not prove that claim,</L>
<L>He thought they still were <HI>men.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But sacred truth the Muse compels</L>
<L>His errors to impart;</L>
<L>And yet the Muse, reluctant, tells</L>
<L>The fault of ELDRED's heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' kind and gentle as the dove,</L>
<L>As free from guile and art,</L>
<L>And mild, and soft as infant love</L>
<L>The feelings of his heart;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if distrust his thoughts engage,</L>
<L>Or jealousy inspires,</L>
<L>His bosom wild and boundless rage</L>
<L>Inflames with all its fires:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not Thule's waves so wildly break</L>
<L>To drown the northern shore;</L>
<L>Not Etna's entrails fiercer shake,</L>
<L>Or Scythia's tempests roar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<L>As when in summer's sweetest day,</L>
<L>To fan the fragrant morn,</L>
<L>The sighing breezes softly stray</L>
<L>O'er fields of ripen'd corn;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sudden the lightning's blast descends,</L>
<L>Deforms the ravag'd fields;</L>
<L>At once the various ruin blends,</L>
<L>And all resistless yields.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when, to clear his stormy breast,</L>
<L>The sun of reason shone,</L>
<L>And ebbing passions sunk to rest,</L>
<L>And shew'd what rage had done:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O then what anguish he betray'd!</L>
<L>His shame how deep, how true!</L>
<L>He view'd the waste his rage had made,</L>
<L>And shudder'd at the view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The meek-ey'd dawn, in saffron robe,</L>
<L>Proclaimed the opening day;</L>
<L>Up rose the sun to gild the globe,</L>
<L>And hail the new-born May;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The birds their amorous notes repeat,</L>
<L>And glad the vernal grove,</L>
<L>Their feather'd partners fondly greet</L>
<L>With many a song of love;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When pious ELDRED walk'd abroad</L>
<L>His morning vows to pay,</L>
<L>And hail the universal Lord</L>
<L>Who gave the goodly day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That done—he left his woodland glade,</L>
<L>And journey'd far away;</L>
<L>He lov'd to court the stranger shade,</L>
<L>And thro' the lone vale stray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<L>Within the bosom of a wood,</L>
<L>By circling hills embrac'd,</L>
<L>A little, modest mansion stood,</L>
<L>Built by the hand of Taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While many a prouder castle fell,</L>
<L>This safely did endure;</L>
<L>The house where guardian virtues dwell</L>
<L>Is sacred, and secure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of Eglantine an humble fence</L>
<L>Around the mansion stood,</L>
<L>Which charm'd at once the ravish'd sense,</L>
<L>And screen'd an infant wood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wood receiv'd an added grace,</L>
<L>As pleas'd it bent to look,</L>
<L>And view'd its ever verdant face</L>
<L>Reflected in a brook.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The smallness of the stream did well</L>
<L>The master's fortunes shew;</L>
<L>But little streams may serve to tell</L>
<L>From what a source they flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This mansion own'd an aged Knight,</L>
<L>And such a man was he,</L>
<L>As Heaven just shews to human sight,</L>
<L>To tell what man shou'd be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His youth in many a well-fought field</L>
<L>Was train'd betimes to war;</L>
<L>His bosom, like a well-worn shield,</L>
<L>Was grac'd with many a scar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The vigour of a green old age</L>
<L>His reverend form did bear;</L>
<L>And yet, alas! the warrior-sage</L>
<L>Had drain'd the dregs of care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>And sorrow more than age can break,</L>
<L>And wound its hapless prey;</L>
<L>'Twas sorrow surrow'd his firm cheek,</L>
<L>And turn'd his bright locks grey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One darling daughter sooth'd his cares,</L>
<L>A young and beauteous dame;</L>
<L>Sole comfort of his failing years,</L>
<L>And BIRTHA was her name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her heart a little sacred shrine,</L>
<L>Where all the Virtues meet;</L>
<L>And holy Hope, and Faith divine,</L>
<L>Had claim'd it for their seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She rear'd a fair and fragrant bower</L>
<L>Of wild and rustic taste,</L>
<L>And there she screen'd each fav'rite flower</L>
<L>From every ruder blast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And not a shrub or plant was there</L>
<L>But did some moral yield;</L>
<L>For wisdom, with a father's care,</L>
<L>Was found in every field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The trees, whose foliage fell away,</L>
<L>And with the summer died,</L>
<L>He thought an image of decay</L>
<L>Might lecture human pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While fair, perennial greens that stood,</L>
<L>And brav'd the wintry blast,</L>
<L>As types of the fair mind he view'd</L>
<L>Which shall for ever last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He taught her that the gaudiest: flowers</L>
<L>Were seldom fragrant found,</L>
<L>But wasted soon their little powers,</L>
<L>Lay useless on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="l2" REF="10"/>
<L>While the sweet pink, and scented rose,</L>
<L>In precious odours last;</L>
<L>And when no more the colour glows,</L>
<L>The sweetness is not past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And here the Virgin lov'd to lead</L>
<L>Her inoffensive day,</L>
<L>And here she oft retir'd to read,</L>
<L>And oft retir'd to pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Embower'd she grac'd the woodland shades,</L>
<L>From courts and cities far,</L>
<L>The pride of Caledonian maids,</L>
<L>The peerless northern star.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As shines that bright and blazing star,</L>
<L>The glory of the night,</L>
<L>When sailing thro' the liquid air,</L>
<L>It pours its lambent light:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such BIRTHA shone!—But when she spoke</L>
<L>The Muse herself was heard,</L>
<L>As on the ravish'd air she broke,</L>
<L>And thus her prayer preferr'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O bless thy BIRTHA, Power Supreme,</L>
<L>"In whom I live and move,</L>
<L>"And bless me most by blessing him</L>
<L>"Whom more than life I love."—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She starts to hear a stranger voice,</L>
<L>And with a modest grace</L>
<L>She lifts her meek eye in surprize,</L>
<L>And sees a stranger face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The stranger lost in transport stood,</L>
<L>Bereft of voice and power,</L>
<L>While she with equal wonder view'd</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED OF THE BOWER.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<L>The mountain breeze which paints her cheek</L>
<L>With Nature's purest dye,</L>
<L>And all the dazzling fires which break</L>
<L>Illustrious from her eye:—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He view'd them all, and as he view'd</L>
<L>Drank deeply of delight;</L>
<L>And still his ravish'd eye pursued,</L>
<L>And feasted on the sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With silent wonder long they gaz'd,</L>
<L>And neither silence broke;</L>
<L>At length the smother'd passion blaz'd,</L>
<L>Enamour'd ELDRED spoke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O sacred Virtue, heav'nly power!</L>
<L>Thy wondrous force I feel;</L>
<L>"I gaze, I tremble, I adore,</L>
<L>Yet die my love to tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Beauty</HI> with coldness I've beheld,</L>
<L>"And 'scap'd the shaft divine;</L>
<L>But what my guardless heart can shield</L>
<L>From <HI>piety</HI> like thine?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She cast her mild eyes on the ground,</L>
<L>And rais'd their beams as fast;</L>
<L>And close her Father dear she found,</L>
<L>Who haply that way past.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good ARDOLPH's eye his BIRTHA meets</L>
<L>With glances of delight;</L>
<L>And thus with courteous speech he greets</L>
<L>The young and graceful Knight:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O gallant Youth, whoe'er thou art,</L>
<L>Thou art welcome to this place;</L>
<L>"There's something rises at my heart</L>
<L>Which says I've seen that face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<L>"Thou generous Knight!" the Youth rejoin'd,</L>
<L>Tho' little known to same,</L>
<L>"I trust I bear a grateful mind—</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED is my name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIR ELDRED?"—ARDOLPH loud exclaim'd,</L>
<L>"Renown'd for worth and power?</L>
<L>For valour and for virtue fam'd,</L>
<L>"SIR ELDRED OF THE BOWER?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Now make me grateful, righteous Heaven,</L>
<L>As thou art good to me,</L>
<L>Since to my aged eyes 'tis given</L>
<L>SIR ELDRED's son to see!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then ARDOLPH caught him by the hand,</L>
<L>And gaz'd upon his face,</L>
<L>And to his aged bosom strain'd,</L>
<L>With many a kind embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Again he view'd him o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>And doubted still the truth,</L>
<L>And ask'd what he had ask'd before,</L>
<L>Then thus addrest the Youth:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Come now beneath my roof, I pray,</L>
<L>Some needful rest to take,</L>
<L>"And with us many a cheerful day</L>
<L>Thy friendly sojourn make."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He enter'd at the gate straightway</L>
<L>Some needful rest to take;</L>
<L>And with them many a cheerful day</L>
<L>Did friendly sojourn make.</L>

<LG>
<L>ONCE—'twas upon a summer's walk,</L>
<L>The gaudy day was fled;</L>
<L>They cheated Time with cheerful talk,</L>
<L>When thus Sir ARDOLPH said:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thy father was the firmest friend</L>
<L>"That e'er my being blest;</L>
<L>"And every virtue Heaven could send,</L>
<L>"Fast bound him to my breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Together did we learn to bear</L>
<L>"The targe and ample shield;</L>
<L>"Together learn'd in many a war,</L>
<L>"The deathful spear to wield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"To make our union still more dear,</L>
<L>"We both were doom'd to prove</L>
<L>"What is most sweet and most severe</L>
<L>"In heart-dissolving love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"The daughter of a neighbouring Knight</L>
<L>"Did <HI>my</HI> fond heart engage;</L>
<L>"And ne'er did Heav'n the virtues write</L>
<L>"Upon a fairer page.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"<HI>His</HI> bosom felt an equal wound,</L>
<L>"Nor sigh'd we long in vain;</L>
<L>"One summer's sun beheld us bound</L>
<L>"In Hymen's holy chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thou wast SIR ELDRED's only child,</L>
<L>"Thy father's darling joy;</L>
<L>"On me a lovely daughter smil'd,</L>
<L>"On me a blooming boy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<L>"But man has woes, has clouds of care,</L>
<L>"That dim his star of life—</L>
<L>"My arms receiv'd the little pair,</L>
<L>"The earth's cold breast, my wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Forgive, thou gentle Knight, forgive,</L>
<L>"Fond foolish tears will flow;</L>
<L>"One day like mine thy heart may heave,</L>
<L>"And mourn its lot of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"But grant, kind Heaven! thou ne'er may'st know</L>
<L>"The pangs I now impart;</L>
<L>"Nor ever feel the deadly blow</L>
<L>"That rives a husband's heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Beside the blooming banks of <HI>Tay,</HI></L>
<L>"My angel's ashes sleep;</L>
<L>"And wherefore should her ARDOLPH stay,</L>
<L>"Except to watch and weep?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I bore my beauteous babes away</L>
<L>"With many a gushing tear,</L>
<L>"I left the blooming banks of <HI>Tay,</HI></L>
<L>"And brought my darlings here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"I watch'd my little household cares,</L>
<L>"And form'd their growing youth;</L>
<L>"And fondly train'd their infant years</L>
<L>"To love and cherish truth."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Thy blooming BIRTHA here I see,"</L>
<L>Sir. ELDRED straight rejoin'd;</L>
<L>"But why thy son is not with thee,</L>
<L>"Resolve my doubting; mind."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When BIRTHA did the question hear,</L>
<L>She sigh'd, but could not speak;</L>
<L>And many a soft and silent tear</L>
<L>Stray'd down her damask check.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
<L>Then pass'd o'er good Sir ARDOLPH's face,</L>
<L>A cast of deadly pale;</L>
<L>But soon compos'd, with manly grace</L>
<L>He thus renew'd his tale:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For him my heart too much has bled,</L>
<L>"For him, my darling son,</L>
<L>"Has sorrow prest my hoary head;</L>
<L>"But—Heav'n's high will be done!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Scarce eighteen winters had revolv'd,</L>
<L>"To crown the circling year,</L>
<L>"Before my valiant boy resolv'd</L>
<L>"The warrior's lance to bear,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Too high I priz'd my native land,</L>
<L>"Too dear his fame I held,</L>
<L>"T' oppose a parent's stern command,</L>
<L>"And keep him from the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"He left me—left his sister too,</L>
<L>"Yet tears bedew'd his face—</L>
<L>"What could a feeble old man do?—</L>
<L>"He burst from my embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"O thirst of glory, fatal flame!</L>
<L>"O laurels dearly bought!</L>
<L>"Yet sweet is death when earn'd with fame—</L>
<L>"So virtuous EDWY thought.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Full manfully the brave boy strove,</L>
<L>"Tho' pressing ranks oppose;</L>
<L>"But weak the strongest arm must prove</L>
<L>"Against an host of foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"A deadly wound my son receives,</L>

<L>"His long—lov'd Mother died again</L>

<LG>
<L>"I would have died—I sought to die;</L>

THE BLEEDING ROCK: A LEGENDARY TALE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHERE beauteous <HI>Belmont</HI> rears its modest brow</L>
<L>To view <HI>Sabrina</HI>'s silver waves below,</L>
<L>Liv'd LINDAMIRA; fair as Beauty's Queen,</L>
<L>The same sweet form, the same enchanting mien;</L>
<L>With all the softer elegance of mind</L>
<L>By genius helghten'd, and by taste refin'd.</L>
<L>Yet early was she doom'd the child of care,</L>
<L>For love, ill-fated love subdued the fair.</L>
<L>Ah! what avails each captivating grace,</L>
<L>The form enchanting, or the finish'd face?</L>
<L>Or what, each beauty of the heav'n born mind,</L>
<L>The soul superior, or the taste refin'd?</L>
<L><HI>Beauty</HI> but serves destruction to insure,</L>
<L>And <HI>sense,</HI> to feel the pang it cannot cure;</L>
<L>Each neighb'ring Youth aspir'd to gain her hand,</L>
<L>And many a suitor came from many a land.</L>
<L>But all in vain each neighb'ring Youth inspir'd,</L>
<L>And distant suitors all in vain admir'd,</L>
<L>Averse to hear, yet fearful to offend,</L>
<L>The lover she refus'd she made a friend:</L>
<L>Her meek rejection wore so mild a face,</L>
<L>More like acceptance seem'd it, than disgrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="28" REF="25"/>
<L>Young POLYDORE, the pride of rural swains,</L>
<L>Was wont to visit <HI>Belmont</HI>'s blooming plains.</L>
<L>Who has not heard how POLYDORE cou'd throw</L>
<L>Th' unerring dart to wound the flying doe?</L>
<L>How leave the swiftest at the race behind,</L>
<L>How mount the courser, and outstrip the wind?</L>
<L>With melting sweetness, or with magic fire,</L>
<L>Breathe the soft flute, or strike the louder lyre?</L>
<L>From that fam'd lyre no vulgar music sprung,</L>
<L>The Graces tun'd it, and Apollo strung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Apollo too was once a shepherd swain,</L>
<L>And fed the flock, and grac'd the rustic plain.</L>
<L>He taught what charms to rural life belong,</L>
<L>The social sweetness, and the sylvan song;</L>
<L>He taught, fair Wisdom in her grove to woo,</L>
<L>Her joys how precious, and her wants how few!</L>
<L>The savage herds in mute attention stood,</L>
<L>And ravish'd <HI>Echo</HI> fill'd the vocal wood;</L>
<L>The sacred Sisters, stooping from their sphere,</L>
<L>Forgot their golden Harps, intent to hear.</L>
<L>Till Heav'n the scene survey'd with jealous eyes,</L>
<L>And Jove, in envy, call'd him to the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young POLYDORE was rich in large domains.</L>
<L>In smiling pastures and in flowery plains:</L>
<L>With these, he boasted each exterior charm,</L>
<L>To win the prudent, and the cold to warm;</L>
<L>To act the tenderness he never felt,</L>
<L>In sorrow soften, and in anguish melt,</L>
<L>The sigh elaborate, the fraudful tear,</L>
<L>The joy dissembled, and the well feign'd fear,</L>
<L>All these were his; and his the treach'rous art</L>
<L>That steals the guileless and unpractis'd heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too soon he heard of LINDAMIRA's fame,</L>
<L>'Twas each enamour'd Shepherd's fav'rite theme;</L>
<L>Return'd the rising, and the setting sun,</L>
<L>The shepherd's fav'rite theme was never done.</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="26"/>They prais'd her wit, her worth, her shape, her air!</L>
<L>And even inferior beauties thought her fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such sweet perfection all his wonder mov'd;</L>
<L>He saw, admir'd, nay, fancied that he lov'd:</L>
<L>But POLYDORE no real passion knew,</L>
<L>Lost to all truth in feigning to be true.</L>
<L>No sense of tenderness could warm a heart</L>
<L>Too proud to feel, too selfish to impart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cold as the snows of <HI>Rhodope</HI> descend,</L>
<L>And with the chilling waves of <HI>Hebrus</HI> blend;</L>
<L>So cold the breast where <HI>Vanity</HI> presides,</L>
<L>And mean Self-love the bosom-feelings guides.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too well, he knew to make his conquest sure,</L>
<L>Win her soft heart, yet keep his own secure.</L>
<L>So oft he told the well imagin'd tale,</L>
<L>So oft he swore, —how shou'd he <HI>not</HI> prevail?</L>
<L>Too unsuspecting not to be deceiv'd,</L>
<L>The well imagin'd tale the nymph believ'd:</L>
<L>She lov'd the youth, she thought herself belov'd,</L>
<L>Nor blush'd to praise whom every maid approv'd,</L>
<L>Alas! that youth, from LINDAMIRA far,</L>
<L>For newer conquests wages cruel war;</L>
<L>With other nymphs on other plains he roams,</L>
<L>Where injur'd LINDAMIRA never comes;</L>
<L>Laughs at her easy faith, insults her woe,</L>
<L>Nor pities tears himself had taught to flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now her eyes soft radiance seem'd to fail,</L>
<L>And now the crimson of her cheek grew pale;</L>
<L>The lily there, in faded beauty, shews</L>
<L>Its sickly empire o'er the vanquish'd rose,</L>
<L>Devouring Sorrow marks her for his prey,</L>
<L>And slow and certain mines his silent way,</L>
<L>Yet, as apace her ebbing life declin'd,</L>
<L>Increasing strength sustain'd her woman's mind.</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="27"/>O had my heart been hard as his,"she cried,</L>
<L>An hapless victim thus I had not died:</L>
<L>If there be gods, and gods there surely are,</L>
<L>lnsulted virtue doubtless is their care.</L>
<L>Then hasten, righteous Heaven ! my tedious fate,</L>
<L>Shorten my woes, and end my mortal date:</L>
<L>Quick let your power transform this failing frame,</L>
<L>Let me be any thing but what I am !</L>
<L>And since the cruel woes I'm doom'd to feel,</L>
<L>Proceed, alas ! from having lov'd too well;</L>
<L>Grant me some form where love can have no part,</L>
<L>Nor human weakness reach my guarded heart:</L>
<L>If pity has not left your blest abodes,</L>
<L>Change me to flinty adamant, ye Gods;</L>
<L>To hardest rock, or monumental stone,</L>
<L>Rather than let me know the pangs I've known:</L>
<L>So shall I thus no farther torments prove,</L>
<L>Nor taunting rivals say, ' she died for love.</L>
<L>For sure if aught can aggravate our fate,</L>
<L>'Tis scorn, or pity from the breast we hate."</L>
<L>She said, —the Gods accord the sad request;</L>
<L>For when were pious pray'rs in vain addrest?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, strange to tell! if rural folks say true,</L>
<L>To harden'd Rock the stiffening damsel grew;</L>
<L>No more her shapeless features can be known,</L>
<L>Stone is her body, and her limbs are stone;</L>
<L>The growing Rock invades her beauteous face,</L>
<L>And quickly petrifies each living grace;</L>
<L>The stone her stature nor her shape retains,</L>
<L>The nymph is vanish'd, but the Rock remains;</L>
<L>Yet wou'd her heart its vital spirits keep,</L>
<L>And scom'd to mingle with the marble heap.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When babbling Fame the fatal tidings bore,</L>
<L>Grief seized the soul of perjur'd POLYDORE;</L>
<L>Despair and horror robb'd his soul of rest,</L>
<L>And deep compunction wrung his tortur'd breast.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="28"/>Then to the fatal spot in haste he hied,</L>
<L>And plung'd a deadly poniard in his side;</L>
<L>He bent his dying eyes upon the stone,</L>
<L>And, "Take, sweet maid,"he cried, "my parting groan."</L>
<L>Fainting, the steel he grasp'd, and as he fell,</L>
<L>The weapon pierc'd the Rock he lov'd so well;</L>
<L>The guiltless steel assail'd the mortal part,</L>
<L>And stabb'd the vital, vulnerable heart.</L>
<L>The life-blood issuing from the wounded stone,</L>
<L>Blends with the crimson current of his own.</L>
<L>And tho' revolving ages since have past,</L>
<L>The meeting torrents undiminish'd last;</L>
<L>Still gushes out the sanguine stream amain,</L>
<L>The standing wonder of the stranger swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now once a year, so rustic records tell,</L>
<L>When o'er the heath resounds the midnight bell;</L>
<L>On eve of Midsummer, that foe to sleep,</L>
<L>What time young maids their annual vigils keep,</L>
<L>The <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Midsummer-men, consulted as oracular by village maids.</NOTE> tell-tale shrub fresh gather'd to declare</L>
<L>The swains who false, from those who constant are;</L>

<L>And to the wondering ear of Fancy talk:</L>
<L>When the scar'd maid steals trembling thro' the grove,</L>
<L>To kiss the tomb of him who died for love:</L>
<L>When, with long watchings, <HI>Care,</HI> at length opprest,</L>
<L>Steals broken pauses of uncertain rest;</L>
<L>Nay, <HI>Grief</HI> short snatches of repose can take,</L>
<L>And nothing but <HI>Despair</HI> is quite awake:</L>
<L>Then, at that hour, so still, so full of fear,</L>
<L>When all things horrible to thought appear,</L>
<L>Is perjur'd POLYDORE observ'd to rove</L>
<L>A ghastly spectre thro' the gloomy grove;</L>
<L>Then to the Rock, the <HI>Bleeding Rock</HI> repair,</L>
<L>Where, sadly sighing, it dissolves to air.</L>
<L>Still when the hours of solemn rites return,</L>
<L>The village train in sad procession mourn;</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="29"/>Pluck every weed which might the spot disgrace,</L>
<L>And plant the fairest field-flow'rs in their place.</L>
