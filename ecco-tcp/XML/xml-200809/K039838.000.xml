<HEAD>THE NATIONAL ADVOCATES.</HEAD>
<L>Spirits divine! who, pleas'd at Nature's birth,</L>
<L>Took your kind station round the recent earth</L>
<L>To watch the world, in viewless state sublime,</L>
<L>A guardian each of each allotted clime—</L>
<L>Ye, who with pity have had cause to melt,</L>
<L>And anguish, such as angels feel, have felt,</L>
<L>To witness evils that ye most abhor,</L>
<L>The fiend-like phrensy of insatiate war,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="3"/>Leagues without justice, without glory strife,</L>
<L>And mad profusion of envenom'd life;</L>
<L>Though crimes, from which your hallow'd optics shrink,</L>
<L>Hurry the vex'd globe to perdition's brink,</L>
<L>Ye will not yet your guilty charge abjure,</L>
<L>And fly from evils that ye fail to cure—</L>
<L>No, Ye have heard from Britain's favour'd isle,</L>
<L>Sounds to excite a troubled Seraph's smile,</L>
<L>And draw to earth, on just protection's plan,</L>
<L>Pure spirits, friendly to the weal of man.</L>
<L>The sound of joy that town to town repeats,</L>
<L>Circling from London and her crowded streets,</L>
<L>As Echo guides it, with exulting hand,</L>
<L>To every confine of th' enfranchis'd land,—</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>That sound of joy was not the frantic roar</L>
<L>Of martial triumph pamper'd high with gore,</L>
<L>That giving murder a gigantic frame,</L>
<L>Rears the grim idol deck'd with Glory's name,</L>
<L>When sanguinary man, with impious pride,</L>
<L>In false devotion real guilt to hide,</L>
<L>With inconsistence not to Pagans known,</L>
<L>Presents preposterous thanks to Mercy's throne,</L>
<L>For having tainted both the earth and air,</L>
<L>With blood that Heaven commanded him to spare.—</L>
<L>The sound of joy, this sympathetic song</L>
<L>Would with fond zeal to distant time prolong,</L>
<L>Spoke not of war, but peace's nobler palm;</L>
<L>In civic tempests it announc'd a calm;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>Assuring Britain, in her worst alarm,</L>
<L>That Law's bright aegis blazes on her arm;</L>
<L>That round her sons the snares of legal death</L>
<L>Burst at the hallow'd touch of Virtue's breath.</L>
<L>Ye nameless powers, who Reason's voice inspire,</L>
<L>Who give to Eloquence her patriot fire;</L>
<L>Ye, who when man, in fields of spotless fame,</L>
<L>Strains noble faculties with noblest aim,</L>
<L>Haste to refresh him at true honour's goal</L>
<L>With eulogy, the music of the soul;</L>
<L>Grant in this verse such lucid praise to live,</L>
<L>As only Truth, fair child of Light, can give,</L>
<L>They only merit, who, of spirit clear,</L>
<L>And, deaf to int'rest, as exempt from fear,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="6"/>Exert, while Power's presumptuous claims they scan,</L>
<L>Celestial gifts in aid of suffering man;</L>
<L>Shew splendid talents sanctified by worth,</L>
<L>And made a blessing to th' admiring earth:—</L>
<L>To you, entitled to the world's applause,</L>
<L>Fraternal advocates in Freedom's cause:—</L>
<L>To you, whom Friendship with fond pride unites,</L>
<L>With all the lustre of her ancient rites,</L>
<L>Of equal probity and varied powers,</L>
<L>In arduous duty's spirit-trying hours,</L>
<L>Each to the other a benignant star,</L>
<L>The Scipio and the Laelius of the bar:—</L>
<L>To you, illustrious friends, whose legal fame</L>
<L>Shall last, while Law herself, a sacred name,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Holds her primaeval right, her blest employ,</L>
<L>Parent of peace, and cherisher of joy:—</L>
<L>To you I offer, nor will you refuse,</L>
<L>You, who as Freedom's child caress the Muse,</L>
<L>Tribute, no power commands, no treasures buy,</L>
<L>Pure as the tear of joy in true Love's eye;</L>
<L>Verse undebas'd by adulation's art,</L>
<L>Fresh from the fountain of a feeling heart,</L>
<L>That scorns all Party rage of either side,</L>
<L>Faction's fierce spleen, and Pow'r's suspicious pride,</L>
<L>And, loving England, that her laws display</L>
<L>The blest beneficence of temperate sway,</L>
<L>Honours her advocates, whose truth and zeal</L>
<L>Stand the firm pillars of the public weal:—</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="8"/>Yes, ye brave pleaders in a cause, whose weight</L>
<L>Press'd on the vitals of a panting State,</L>
<L>'Twas not alone the being of a few</L>
<L>Black with false guilt, in dim suspicion's view,</L>
<L>Whose lives, in deference to minds so rare,</L>
<L>Justice consign'd to your defensive care:</L>
<L>'Twas Britain's honour, 'twas her noblest wealth,</L>
<L>The very essence of the public health,</L>
<L>For which your patriot eloquence display'd</L>
<L>Those matchless powers, that bold yet temperate aid,</L>
<L>Which Themis sanctioned with a sacred smile,</L>
<L>And rightful joy convuls'd her rescued isle.</L>
<L>Whence is the gen'rous pride, a test of worth,</L>
<L>That makes a Briton glory in his birth?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>Not that his country, Nature's favour'd isle,</L>
<L>Is fenc'd by commerce with a golden pile;</L>
<L>And can impel, with rich temptation's flood,</L>
<L>Poor continental kings to trade in blood,</L>
<L>Though reaping, as their fruit of martial care,</L>
<L>Discomfiture, disgrace, dismay, despair:</L>
<L>No: he exults that in his native land,</L>
<L>Hearts by the warmth of Liberty expand;</L>
<L>And Intellect, a tree that loves the light,</L>
<L>Shoots like a cedar of imperial height;</L>
<L>While fearless Freedom, with an eagle's ken,</L>
<L>Searching the soul of measures and of men,</L>
<L>Alike contemns, in their unmasking hour,</L>
<L>The dupe of Party, and the slave of Power;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>And celebrates, what here she still can find,</L>
<L>True public virtue in a potent mind.</L>
<L>When a sick nation, like a feverish child,</L>
<L>Sinks in a panick, wayward, dark, and wild;</L>
<L>From fear to fear in blind confusion runs,</L>
<L>Mistakes for foreign imps her genuine sons;</L>
<L>Calls Loyalty a Traitor, Truth a Liar,</L>
<L>And Freedom's vital warmth Sedition's fire:</L>
<L>When rampant Power, beyond Ixion proud,</L>
<L>Impregnates with chimeras every cloud,</L>
<L>Blest be the minds, whose virtuous labours serve</L>
<L>To save their darkling country's visual nerve;</L>
<L>While fancied plots and shadowy perils fly</L>
<L>Distemper's film, that dimm'd the nation's eye,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>Who, with recover'd sight, exults to see</L>
<L>It is not treason, still to wish her free.</L>
<L>Reason may smile, if sophistry would show</L>
<L>A faithful subject is a treacherous foe;</L>
<L>And those, who strike at vices in the State,</L>
<L>Must mean a Monarch's fall, and seek his fate;</L>
<L>As if corruption were the vital spring</L>
<L>Of that effulgent mortal styl'd a King.</L>
<L>Unguarded Poet, in this troubled time,</L>
<L>Beware, cries Caution, how you rant in rhime,</L>
<L>Lest you should find there's treason in the metre,</L>
<L>That deems a Monarch a mere earthly creature.</L>
<L>With rational respect, not stupid awe,</L>
<L>As the just offspring and the guard of law,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>The voice of England, her creative voice,</L>
<L>Hails in a King the ruler of her choice.</L>
<L>And Nature here, as if inclin'd to claim</L>
<L>Immortal rev'rence for the regal name,</L>
<L>Bade Alfred's virtues to the world evince</L>
<L>How rightfully we prize a Patriot Prince:</L>
<L>Model of Kings! in a benighted age,</L>
<L>All that adorns the Hero and the Sage;</L>
<L>Lycurgus, Caesar, Antonine in one,</L>
<L>With all their talents, of their errors none:</L>
<L>Thou, whose pure spirit to thy subjects taught,</L>
<L>The sons of England should be free as thought:</L>
<L>Thy arm preserv'd, and thy more potent mind,</L>
<L>With sapient aid, establish'd or refin'd,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>For scenes more perilous than martial strife,</L>
<L>Our guardian Juries, as the friends of life!</L>
<L>With fond delight, and with parental love,</L>
<L>Thy people's Father! from the realms above,</L>
<L>Thy sainted spirit may exult to see,</L>
<L>That people guarding what they owe to thee:</L>
<L>Law's soundest buckler, Freedom's brightest dower,</L>
<L>Shielding bold Truth from irritable Power.</L>
<L>Ye Great, whose souls to genuine glory spring,</L>
<L>With such ambition as becomes a king,</L>
<L>Mark how true greatness may in ev'ry clime</L>
<L>Command unceasing life thro' distant time!</L>
<L>Gifts, that Beneficence, on Wisdom's plan,</L>
<L>Confers to meliorate the lot of man,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>Live unimpair'd, unconscious of decay,</L>
<L>While Pride's ignoble pageants pass away.</L>
<L>The heart of Alfred still our love excites,</L>
<L>He lives, he breathes in ev'ry Jury's rights!</L>
<L>Though of his line no Prince upholds the name,</L>
<L>He still exists the favourite of Fame!</L>
<L>Though following kings, of ampler pomp and power,</L>
<L>Finish'd in fume their transitory hour:</L>
<L>Tudors of hot, and Stuarts of cold blood,</L>
<L>Have sunk like wrecks in a tempestuous flood:</L>
<L>For, at the will of Heaven's Almighty Sire,</L>
<L>Palaces fall, and dynasties expire.—</L>
<L>The noble Line, that, with Religion's smile,</L>
<L>Freedom invited to this far-fam'd Isle;</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="15"/>Whom Honour wafted on his golden wings</L>
<L>To this his fav'rite throne, and cried: "Be Kings!</L>
<L>Rule with mild sway whom Force shall ne'er enslave,</L>
<L>And long may Virtue guard what Freedom gave!"—</L>
<L>This Line, that boasts the purest claim to power,</L>
<L>May fail—Avert, just Heav'n! their final hour;</L>
<L>And keep them as they keep their regal vow!—</L>
<L>Yet they may fail, and mortals know not how:</L>
<L>But if—in times no living eye can see,</L>
<L>Distant, far distant may that period be!</L>
<L>If England must perceive with fond regret</L>
<L>The star of Brunswick is for ever set;</L>
<L>A George with Alfred may this glory share,</L>
<L>That Law's pure current was his sov'reign care:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="16"/>If from great Alfred's reign free Juries flow,</L>
<L>The independent Judge to George we owe.</L>
<L>Mild Sov'reign! doom'd, in life's tumultuous dream,</L>
<L>To feel of bliss and woe each wide extreme,</L>
<L>Justice could well thy youthful care engage,</L>
<L>May Heaven make Peace an idol of thy age!</L>
<L>O bid this wheel of War revolve no more,</L>
<L>This frantic lottery of guilt and gore!</L>
<L>Where, when Truth weighs the profit and the pain,</L>
<L>None but the Fiends of desolation gain.</L>
<L>Let not false policy, to Nature blind,</L>
<L>And deaf to Reason pleading for mankind,</L>
<L>Precipitately urge a barb'rous war,</L>
<L>That Equity and Truth alike abhor,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="17"/>As weak in conduct, as devoid of right,</L>
<L>And boding certain ill in ev'ry light:</L>
<L>Speed as it may, each opposite event</L>
<L>Freedom must fear, Humanity lament.</L>
<L>No, cry the advocates for lasting strife,</L>
<L>Let us be prodigal of wealth and life;</L>
<L>Let Britain's treasure round the globe be hurl'd,</L>
<L>Long let her subsidise the regal world;</L>
<L>Rather than see the Gallic rage advance,</L>
<L>And madd'ning Europe ape the crimes of France!</L>
<L>England, brave nation, of an honest mind,</L>
<L>Yet often dup'd as credulously blind;</L>
<L>Too apt, when artifice obstructs thy view,</L>
<L>To shrink from fancied ills, and scorn the true;</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="18"/>Learn, when thy neighbour of superb pretence,</L>
<L>Whose feelings are too quick for sober sense;</L>
<L>Learn, when assuming France, by Folly led,</L>
<L>Might best awaken thy judicious dread:</L>
<L>Not in the hour when, spurning base controul,</L>
<L>She pluck'd the iron from her wounded soul;</L>
<L>Not in the hour when Indignation's arm</L>
<L>O'erthrew her proud Bastile, as with a charm,</L>
<L>And gave to festive Joy the vacant space,</L>
<L>Nobly disburthen'd of Earth's dark disgrace:</L>
<L>No—in her ancient calm, her nerveless hour</L>
<L>Of tame submission to despotic power,</L>
<L>France might excite more reasonable fear,</L>
<L>Than all her armies in their first career;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="19"/>For, when in Tyranny's cold grasp she lay,</L>
<L>And strove to smile her sense of wrongs away,</L>
<L>On her soft breast a specious Fiend she nurs'd,</L>
<L>Of all insinuating fiends the worst:</L>
<L>Pleas'd to empoison nations with her breath,</L>
<L>And sow the viewless seeds of public death;</L>
<L>To deaden virtue, to dispirit joy,</L>
<L>And all the energies of life destroy.</L>
<L>For in the minds that, fearsul of deceit,</L>
<L>Slowly embrace this fascinating cheat,</L>
<L>Reason, self-puzzled, loses all its skill,</L>
<L>To mark th' eternal bounds of good and ill;</L>
<L>To them Religion's sweet seraphic face</L>
<L>Appears the sickly mask of sour grimace:</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="20"/>Man, her dear charge, they deem a moving clod,</L>
<L>And, deaf to the paternal voice of God,</L>
<L>Despise the gift his gracious power bestow'd,</L>
<L>Feeling existence a lethargic load.</L>
<L>Whence sprung the fiend, whose tyrannous controul</L>
<L>Thus robs of every joy the palsied soul?</L>
<L>Born to avenge what Greece endur'd from Rome,</L>
<L>Amidst an attic garden's baneful bloom</L>
<L>Rose the fair pest, in beauty and in power</L>

<L><PB N="20" REF="21"/>Two kindred forms, where'er she moves, are seen,</L>
<L>The sure attendants of their potent Queen:</L>
<L>First, bloated Indolence, whose cheeks disclose</L>
<L>The sickly colours of the wither'd rose;</L>
<L>Whose languid arm scarce bears the light employ,</L>
<L>To lift the bubbling cup of mimic joy;</L>
<L>Whose lips deride, with a contemptuous sneer,</L>
<L>Firm Virtue struggling in Contention's sphere.</L>
<L>Behind her, Apathy, whose half-glaz'd eyes</L>
<L>Ne'er melt with love, or sparkle with surprise;</L>
<L>Whose touch, more cold than Terror's icy breath,</L>
<L>Shoots through the wither'd heart petrific Death.</L>
<L>With these, her ministers, to Rome she fled,</L>
<L>And struck the nerve of Roman vigour dead;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="22"/>The tow'ring Eagle fell her palsied prey,</L>
<L>And dying Freedom curs'd her baleful sway.</L>
<L>Awhile she sat with Triumph's flag unfurl'd,</L>
<L>The laughing Vict'ress of the Roman world;</L>
<L>In pomp Circean, there she joy'd to shine,</L>
<L>Her cave the palace, Emperors her swine!</L>
<L>But soon her nerveless slaves, unfit for war,</L>
<L>Sunk into dust before the sons of Thor;</L>
<L>The Sorceress fell, with all her feeble charms,</L>
<L>Crush'd by the brave barbarians' massive arms.</L>
<L>Through many an age she lay in lifeless trance,</L>
<L>But wak'd to wider ill in servile France;</L>
<L>Gallia's proud Genius, who by force in vain</L>
<L>Had toil'd to forge an universal chain,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="23"/>Tried o'er the earth his empire to extend,</L>
<L>By the smooth arts of this insidious friend;</L>
<L>Snare Virtue's sons by Pleasure's syren form,</L>
<L>And sap those bulwarks that he fail'd to storm.</L>
<L>Brave generous Britons, who have less to fear</L>
<L>From open enmity's uplifted spear,</L>
<L>Beware this smiling pestilence, and know</L>
<L>In French Philosophy your deadliest foe!</L>
<L>O for that warning lyre, whose solemn swell</L>
<L>Loudly proclaim'd th' advancing Lord of Hell,</L>
<L>When first that prime Artificer of Ill</L>
<L>Leap'd with light bound o'er Eden's highest hill!—</L>
<L>For not more hostile to those happy bowers,</L>
<L>Came the fierce Chief of Falsehood's treach'rous Powers,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="24"/>Than the gay Syren, fraught with impious guile,</L>
<L>To the frank virtues of this fearless Isle.</L>
<L>Yet vain such warning!—As a welcome guest,</L>
<L>Deluded Britain met the smiling pest;</L>
<L>And oh how wide new scenes of woe extend,</L>
<L>Since the base stranger grew her bosom friend!</L>
<L>Vain Dissipation, in her wild abyss,</L>
<L>O'erwhelms the temp'rate guards of genuine bliss:</L>
<L>No more Fidelity, with Seraph's power,</L>
<L>Spreads her firm wing around the nuptial bower,</L>
<L>That heirs of Truth, of Virtue, Health, and Grace</L>
<L>May spring to life from Passion's pure embrace;</L>
<L>Prepar'd to cherish with affection fond</L>
<L>Each private duty, and each public bond:</L>

<L>And make Humility more strong than Pride:</L>
<L>To French Philosophy these fall a prey,</L>
<L>And Life's prime blessings are all laugh'd away:—</L>
<L>Nay, Life itself! For, when the Sophist tribes</L>
<L>With the keen stroke of their sarcastic gibes</L>

<L>By which the anchor'd spirit rests on Heaven—</L>
<L>What gulphs the vessel of the Mind o'erwhelm,</L>
<L>When spleenful Phrensy has usurp'd the helm!</L>
<L>Have we not seen a France-taught Sophist here</L>
<L>To impious Suicide a refuge rear,</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="26"/>And give, with argument's delusive air,</L>
<L>A treach'rous sanction to her mad despair?</L>

<L>'Tis fervent gratitude, and fond esteem</L>
<L>For names still bright with Public Virtue's beam;</L>
<L>'Tis gen'rous pride, of reason the result,</L>

<L>That, while o'er other realms in Slavery's chain,</L>

<L>When Tully, destin'd to the Grecian's doom,</L>
<L>Pour'd forth philippics to applauding Rome;</L>
<L>Personal hate, with patriot virtue warm,</L>
<L>Gave force and fury to his verbal storm.</L>
<L>These heroes of the hot forensic scene</L>
<L>Blended with public zeal their private spleen:—</L>
<L>Not so the Pleaders who this verse inspire,</L>
<L>Who merit paeans, from a nobler lyre:</L>
<L>As free from virulence, as void of fear,</L>
<L>In conduct graceful, as in motive clear.</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="32"/>They paid just homage to presiding Law,</L>
<L>With manly deference, and decent awe.</L>
<L>No selfish pride, in which light minds rejoice,</L>
<L>Rais'd to victorious sway their temp'rate voice:</L>
<L>But England's welfare, on their heart imprest,</L>
<L>Pure public virtue, glowing in their breast,</L>
<L>Arm'd their just souls with intellectual force,</L>
<L>To check Authority's vindictive course,</L>
<L>And turn Delusion's tide in Danger's hour,</L>
<L>Reckless of frowns from Prejudice and Power.</L>
<L>ERSKINE and GIBBS! whose names, to Nature dear,</L>
<L>Ages unborn may gratesully revere;</L>
<L>While this memorial of your worth I raise,</L>
<L>And firmly credit what I fondly praise;</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="33"/>One hateful truth shall Mem'ry dare suggest,</L>
<L>Grav'd on the deep recesses of her breast:</L>
<L>Rudely she teaches, from her ample range,</L>
<L>That Public Virtue is most apt to change.</L>
<L>The faithful hand, that these frank lines supplied,</L>
<L>Ne'er lavish'd incense by the heart belied;</L>
<L>But, with fond zeal to court in joyous youth</L>
<L>A public idol of imagin'd truth,</L>
<L>Has oft discarded an unfinish'd task,</L>
<L>Finding Apostacy in Virtue's mask;</L>
<L>For ere my fingers could the garland weave,</L>
<L>Like that our hapless Father twin'd for Eve,</L>
<L>It dropp'd, and all its faded roses shed,</L>
<L>Scorning to garnish an Apostate's head.</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="34"/>But may this civic wreath, in eager haste</L>
<L>Form'd of wild flowers, by Merit's smile be grac'd!</L>
<L>For lives preserv'd unquestionably due,</L>
<L>(The nameless donor proves the tribute true;)</L>
<L>Bays from Sincerity's obscure retreat</L>
<L>May cherish Virtue in Contention's heat.</L>
<L>Ye, to whom England owes a pleasing debt,</L>
<L>That English gratitude should ne'er forget;</L>
<L>Thus Freedom prays, to recompense your care,</L>
<L>Deign, righteous Heav'n! to ratify the pray'r:</L>
<L>"Live my firm aids to life's serenest end,</L>
<L>Friends to each other, each the people's friend;</L>
<L>Live beyond life of Briton's glory part,</L>
<L>Enshrin'd for ever in the public heart!"</L>
