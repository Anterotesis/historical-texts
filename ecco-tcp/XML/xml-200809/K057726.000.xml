<P>ROBIN HOOD; OR, SHERWOOD FOREST: A COMIC OPERA.</P>
<P>AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL, IN COVENT-GARDEN.</P>

<HEAD>To Mr. WM. SHIELD, Composer to the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GIL BLAS advised a friend who had written for the stage with success, to publish his works, observing that as he had imposed upon the public by the representation of bad pieces, he ought to open their eyes in gratitude for the reception they had met. This Opera, I fear, like the works of the Spanish dramatist, tho' applauded on the stage, may fall under censure in the closet, where it must appear divested of that aid it received from your excellent musical compositions, and the incom∣parable acting with which the characters were supported. The three principal ideas which combine the subject are not original, but bor∣rowed from the ballads of <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> the <HI>Nut∣brown Maid,</HI> and the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Hermit of the Dale</HI> is taken from a ballad called, the <HI>Friar of orders Grey,</HI> which is taken from an old ballad called the <HI>Herdsman.</HI></NOTE><HI>Hermit of the Dale</HI>: I adopted them as being popular. It was my first intention to have taken all the songs from old ballads; those I have selected are, I trust, not ill chosen, or unapplicable to the piece. ROBIN HOOD and his merry Archers have often been upon the Stage. The <HI>Biographia Dramatica</HI> gives an account of six pieces in which this celebrated outlaw was the hero, exclusive of the <HI>Sad Shepherd</HI> by Ben Johnson; but it does not appear that any of them met with success. I address these observations to you, as a tribute to your merit; happy in having an opportunity of publicly assuring you, that no man stands higher in my esteem. Your friend,</P>

<P>Why are we called out-laws, John?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. Laws were made to punish rogues; but we being honest fellows, are put out of the law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then honesty and law are not found together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; and therefore being honest we live against the law; and yet, with due deference to the learned profession, we live honestly as those who live by the law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark—We kill the King's deer, and are called thieves; but who are the greatest thieves, we who feed on royal venison, or those who prey upon his majesty's liege subjects? Stand close and attend to me lads—our captain, the brave Earl of Huntingdon, has a call upon our service, there∣fore every man must look to his arms; let your quivers be well stocked with arrows, and see that your bow-strings are all sound. This night we sally forth on an expedition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our captain you all know was betrothed to the fair Clorinda, niece to Baron Fitz Herbert. You also know, that on the very eve of marriage he was ordered from court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now this was all owing to the bishop of Hereford, who maliciously poisoned the royal ear, and the instant the noble Huntingdon became an object of the King's displeasure, the whole court tribe, even the very caterpillars who fed upon his bounty avoided him as if he was contagious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we, John, stuck to him, and will while we have life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand—a man never truly knows his friends till misfortune overtakes him. But mark—Our leader's heart is fixed upon the lady Clorinda, and she loves him with equal ar∣dour; but the proud Baron, her uncle, keeps her locked up, and prevents all intercourse between them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bowman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not attack the Baron's castle and carry her off by force—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the business you are to be employed on—we will execute it this very night; but not a word to Robin, voluntary service is most valuable, and to-morrow, I trust, we shall be able to present his mistress to him—

<P>Well distinguished; for though all knaves are fools, all fools are not knaves. Where do you reside, tinker?</P>

<P>Where I stand. I carry my shop on my back, as the snail carries his house; am always at home, yet am a traveller.</P>

<P>A fool a traveller! but that is no new case, many of our travellers having proved them∣selves fools. Let the tinker be free. But say, lads, what plunder have you brought in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scarlet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much. We met a monk, who de∣nied having cash, but Robin forced him to pray to his titular saint for some, and after five minutes devo∣tion, on searching his reverence, we found twenty broad pieces in his hood; but the money did not remain long with us: falling with one of the bishop of Hereford's tenants, who was flying from his ha∣bitation, being unable to pay his rent, Robin, with his accustomed humanity, made him a pre∣sent of the Friar's tribute.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, in manners, he is a vain fop; and, in his heart, a cunning deceiver. Like an over-ripe pear, fair without, but bad within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stella.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, brother, he is a fop; for when he brings home posies from the meadows, he always culls the sweetest and prettiest to orna∣ment himself; and he is a deceiver, as poor Martha knows to her cost. Oh! poor Martha! she was once the very life of the Forest.</P>

<P>But what think you of Little John?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think him a russetan, a goodly apple, with a plain outside, but sound core.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stella.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think so too; for he strews thyme under my window, when he thinks I do not see him; and when he gathers wild strawberries, or filberts, or finds honeycombs in the woods, he al∣ways presents them to me untouched.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is as much difference between John and Scarlet, as between an honest man and a knave. I know they are both your admirers, but be cautious in bestowing your affection; you are very young, Stella; and love, my girl, has its bitters as well as sweets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stella.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would tell you a secret—but you must hear me without censure; or if you reprove, re∣member, the lessons of affection make the deepest impressions when breathed in gentleness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak with freedom. Something I fear has hurt you.</P>

<P>Yes, I am hurt, yet I cannot tell where, I am pleased too, yet I cannot tell why. I sigh when I wish to smile. Nay more, I am warm in the cool shade, and freeze even in the sun. Heigh ho!</P>

<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how long have you had this com∣plaint?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How long! It has been coming on me by degrees at least these long, long two months.
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
Let me whisper you a question; nay, turn your head, I cannot speak while you look in my face. You must know, Little John this day gave me some wild plumbs—La, I cannot say a word more!</P>

<SPEAKER>Allen.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth is you love John.</P>
</SP>

<P>Listen to reason! No, sirrah, not on the part of the prisoner: I sit here as a judge of law, not of reason; besides, I have four reasons for hanging you. First, you must be hanged, because I am not to sit here for nothing: secondly, you must be hanged, because you have nobody to stand up for you: thirdly, you must be hanged, because you appear in <HI>forma pauperis</HI> without mo∣ney; and, fourthly, you must be hanged, because you have a damned hanging look.
