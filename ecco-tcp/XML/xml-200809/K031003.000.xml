<L>EACH young Apprentice, when he's bound to Trade,</L>
<L>This solemn vow to GOD and Man has made.</L>
<L>To do with joy his Master's just commands,</L>
<L>Nor trust his secrets into other hands.</L>
<L>He must no damage to his substance do,</L>
<L>And see that others do not wrong him too.</L>
<L>His Master's goods he shall not waste nor lend,</L>
<L>But all his property with care defend.</L>
<L>He shall not buy nor sell without his leave,</L>
<L>Nor lie, nor injure, nor at all deceive.</L>
<L>Taverns and ALE-HOUSES he shall not haunt,</L>
<L>Those snares to Youth, those scenes of vice and want.</L>
<L>At CARDS and DICE he shall not dare to play,</L>
<L>But fly from such temptations far away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Youth! remember thou to this art BOUND,</L>
<L>See that no breach of this in thee be found.</L>
