<HEAD TYPE="sub">The seventh Battle, for the Body of <HI>Patroclus:</HI> The Acts of <HI>Menelaus.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MEnelaus,</HI> upon the Death of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> defends his Bo∣dy from the Enemy: <HI>Euphorbus</HI> who attempts it, is slain. <HI>Hector</HI> advancing, <HI>Menelaus</HI> retires, but soon returns with <HI>Ajax,</HI> and drives him off. This <HI>Glaucus</HI> ob∣jects to <HI>Hector</HI> as a Flight, who thereupon puts on the Armour he had won from <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and renews the Battel. The <HI>Greeks</HI> give Way, till <HI>Ajax</HI> rallies them: Aeneas sustains the <HI>Trojans. Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Hector</HI> attempt the Chariot of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which is borne off by <HI>Automedon.</HI> The Horses of <HI>Achilles</HI> deplore the Loss of <HI>Patroclus:</HI> Jupiter covers his Body with a thick Dark∣ness: The noble Prayer of <HI>Ajax</HI> on that Occasion. <HI>Menelaus</HI> sends <HI>Antilochus</HI> to <HI>Achilles,</HI> with the News of <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Death: Then returns to the Fight, where, tho' attack'd with the utmost Fury, he, and <HI>Meriones</HI> assisted by the <HI>Ajaxes,</HI> bear off the Body to the Ships.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the only Book of the Iliad which is a continued Description of a Battel, without any Digression or Episode, that serves for an Inter∣val to refresh the Reader. The heav'nly Ma∣chines too are fewer than in any other. <HI>Homer</HI> seems to have trusted wholly to the Force of his own Genius, as suffici∣ent to support him, whatsoever lengths he was carried by it. But that Spirit which animates the Original, is what I am sensible evaporates so much in my Hands; that, tho' I can't think my Author tedious, I should have made him seem so, if I had not translated this Book with all possible Conciseness. I hope there is nothing material omitted, tho' the Version consists but of sixty five Lines more than the Original.</P>
<P>However, one may observe there are more Turns of Fortune, more Defeats, more Rallyings, more Accidents, in this Battel, than in any other; because it was to be the last wherein the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans</HI> were upon equal Terms, before the Return of <HI>Achilles:</HI> And besides, all this serves to introduce the chief Hero with the greater Pomp and Dignity.</P>

He is represented as the foremost who appears in his Defence, not only as one of a like Disposition of Mind with <HI>Patroclus,</HI> a kind and generous Friend; but as being more immediately concern'd in Honour to protect from Injuries the Body of a Hero that fell in his Cause. <HI>Eustathius.</HI> See the 29<SUP>th</SUP> Note on the 3<SUP>d</SUP> Book.</P>

He must have little Sense or Knowledge in Poetry, who thinks that it ought to be suppress'd. It is true, we shou'd not ues it now-a-days, by reason of the low Ideas we have of the Animals from which it is derived; but those not being the Ideas of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Time, they could not hinder him from making a proper Use of such a Comparison. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE <HI>id. Thus round her new fal'n Young,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> It seems to me remarkable, that the several Comparisons to illustrate the Concern for <HI>Patroclus,</HI> are taken from the most tender
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
Sentiments of Nature. <HI>Achilles</HI> in the Beginning of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> Book, considers him as a Child, and himself as his Mother. The Sorrow of <HI>Menelaus</HI> is here described as that of a Heifer for her young one. Perhaps these are design'd to intimate the excellent Temper and Goodness of <HI>Patro∣clus,</HI> which is express'd in that fine Elogy of him in this Book, ℣. 671. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>He knew how to be good-natur'd to all Men.</HI> This gave all Mankind these Sentiments for him, and no doubt the same is strongly point∣ed at by the uncommon Concern of the whole Army to rescue his Body.</P>
<P>The Dissimilitude of Manners between these two Friends, <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Patroclus,</HI> is very observable: Such Friendships are not uncommon, and I have often assign'd this Reason for them, that it is natural for Men to seek the Assistance of those Qualities in others, which they want themselves. That is still better if apply'd to Providence, that associates Men of different and contrary Qualities, in order to make a more perfect System. But, whatever is customary in Na∣ture, <HI>Homer</HI> had a good poetical Reason for it; for it af∣fords many Incidents to illustrate the Manners of them both more strongly; and is what they call a Contrast in Painting.</P>

Otherwise it might be urg'd, that <HI>Achilles</HI> cou'd not have kill'd <HI>Hector</HI> without the Advantage of having his Armous made by the Hand of a God, whereas <HI>Hector</HI>'s was only of the Hand of a Mortal; but since both were clad in Armour made by <HI>Vulcan, Achilles</HI>'s Victory will be compleat, and in its full Lustre.

<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
<HI>Hector</HI> sent these Arms to <HI>Troy?</HI> Why did not he take them at first? There are three Answers, which I think are all plausible. The first, that <HI>Hector</HI> having kill'd <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and seeing the Day very far advanced, had no mind to take those Arms for a Fight almost at an end. The second, that he was impatient to shew to <HI>Priam</HI> and <HI>Andromache</HI> those glorious Spoils. Thirdly, he perhaps at first intended to hang them up in some Temple: <HI>Glaucus</HI>'s Speech makes him change his Resolution, he runs after those Arms to fight against <HI>Ajax,</HI> and to win <HI>Patroclus</HI>'s Body from him. <HI>Dacier.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> (says <HI>Eustathius</HI>) does not suffer the Arms to be carry'd into <HI>Troy</HI> for these Reasons. That <HI>Hector</HI> by wear∣ing them might the more encourage the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and be the more formidable to the <HI>Greeks:</HI> That <HI>Achilles</HI> may re∣cover them again when he kills <HI>Hector:</HI> And that he may conquer him, even when he is strengthened with that di∣vine Armour.</P>

Therefore <HI>Jupiter</HI> expresses his Sorrow at the ap∣proaching Fate of this unfortunate Prince, promises to repay his Loss of Life with Glory, and nods to give a certain Con∣firmation to his Words.

[<HI>Ethic. ad Nicom.</HI> l. 2. c. 9. and l. 3. c. 11.] And thus <HI>Cicero</HI> ascribed to <HI>Agamemnon</HI> a long Discourse of <HI>Ulysses</HI> in the second Iliad; [<HI>De divinatione</HI> l. 2.] and cited as <HI>Ajax</HI>'s, the Speech of <HI>Hector</HI> in the seventh. [See <HI>Aul. Gellius</HI> l. 15. c. 6.] One has no cause to wonder at this, since the Ancients having <HI>Homer</HI> almost by heart, were for that very Reason the more subject to mistake in citing him by Memory.</P>
<P>To this I think one may answer, that granting it was partly the Occasion of <HI>Ajax</HI>'s Prayer to obtain Light, in order to send to <HI>Achilles</HI> (which he afterwards does) yet the Thought which <HI>Longinus</HI> attributes to him, is very consistent with it; and the last Line expresses nothing else but an

heroic Desire rather to die in the Light, than escape with Safety in the Darkness.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q> But indeed the whole Speech is only meant to paint the Con∣cern and Distress of a brave General: The Thought of send∣ing a Messenger is only a Result from that Concern and Distress, and so but a small Circumstance; which cannot be said to occasion the Pray'r.</P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Boileau</HI> has translated this Passage in two Lines.<Q><L>Grand Dieu! chasse la nuit qui nous couvre les yeux,</L>
<L>Et combats contre nous a la clarté des Cieux.</L></Q> And Mr. <HI>la Motte</HI> yet better in one.<Q><L>Grand Dieu! rends nous le jour, &amp; combats contre nous!</L></Q> But both these (as <HI>Dacier</HI> very justly observes) are contrary to <HI>Homer</HI>'s Sense. He is far from representing <HI>Ajax</HI> of such a daring Impiety, as to bid <HI>Jupiter</HI> combate against him; but only makes him ask for Light, that if it be his Will the <HI>Greeks</HI> shall perish, they may perish in open Day. <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—(says he) that is, abandon us, withdraw from us your Assi∣stance; for those who are deserted by <HI>Jove</HI> must perish infalli∣bly: This Decorum of <HI>Homer</HI> ought to have been preserv'd.</P>

It was not possible that <HI>Aeneas</HI> could be so deeply interested for any Man, as <HI>Achilles</HI> was interested for <HI>Pa∣troclus:</HI> For <HI>Virgil</HI> had no Colour to kill <HI>Ascanius,</HI> who was little more than a Child; besides, that his Hero's In∣terest in the War of <HI>Italy</HI> was great enough of itself, not to need to be animated by so touching a Concern as the fear of losing his Son.

<HI>Troy</HI> (as he had told <HI>Agamemnon</HI> in the beginning of the Poem) and knowing, besides, that he was to perish there, required some very pressing Motive to engage him to per∣sist in it, after such Disgusts and Insults as he had received. It was this which made it necessary for these two great Poets to treat a Subject so much in their own Nature alike, in a manner so different.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 100, 125. <HI>The two Speeches of</HI> Achilles <HI>to</HI> Thetis.]</Q> It is not possible to imagine more lively and beautiful Strokes of Nature and Passion, than those which our Author ascribes to <HI>Achilles</HI> throughout these admirable Speeches. They contain all, that the truest Friend, the most tender Son, and the most generous Hero, could think or express in this delicate and affecting Circumstance. He shews his Ex∣cess of Love to his Mother, by wishing he had never been born or known to the World, rather than she should have endur'd so many Sufferings on his account: He shews no less Love for his Friend, in resolving to revenge his Death upon <HI>Hector,</HI> tho' his own would immediately follow. We see him here ready to meet his Fate for the sake of his Friend, and in the <HI>Odysseis</HI> we find him wishing to live again only to maintain his Father's Honour against his Enemies: Thus he values neither Life nor Death, but as they conduce to the Good of his Friend and Parents, or the Encrease of his Glory.</P>
<P>After having calmly consider'd the present State of his Life, he deliberately embraces his approaching Fate; and comforts himself under it, by a Reflection on those great Men, whom neither their illustrious Actions, nor their Af∣finity to Heaven, could save from the general Doom. A Thought very natural to him, whose Business it was in Peace to sing their Praises, and in War to imitate their Acti∣ons. <HI>Achilles,</HI> like a Man passionate of Glory, takes none but the finest Models; he thinks of <HI>Hercules,</HI> who was the
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
Son of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and who had fill'd the Universe with the Noise of his immortal Actions: These are the Sentiments of a real Hero. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Achilles</HI> could not be ignorant that he was superior to others in Battel; and it was therefore no Fault in him to say so.

<Q><L>Exoritur clamorque virûm clangorque tubarum.</L></Q>
And celebrates <HI>Misenus</HI> as the Trumpeter of <HI>Aeneas.</HI> But as <HI>Virgil</HI> wrote at a time more remote from those heroic Ages, perhaps this Liberty may be excused. But a Poet had better confine himself to Customs and Manners, like a Painter; and it is equally a Fault in either of them to ascribe to Times and Nations any thing with which they were unacquainted.</P>
<P>One may add an Oservation to this Note of M. <HI>Dacier,</HI> that the Trumpet's not being in use at that time, makes very much for <HI>Homer</HI>'s Purpose in this Place.

<P>The Allegory of <HI>Vulcan,</HI> or Fire (according to <HI>Heraclides</HI>) is this.

which they imagined to be shadowed under these Descri∣ptions, especially <HI>Damo</HI> (suppos'd the Daughter of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>) whose Explication is as follows. <HI>Thetis,</HI> who receives the Arms, means the apt Order and Disposition of all things in the Crea∣tion.

<P><HI>Heraclides Ponticus</HI> thus pursues the Allegory. <HI>Homer</HI> (says he) makes the working of his Shield, that is the World, to be begun by <HI>Night,</HI> as indeed all Matter lay undistinguish'd in an original and universal <HI>Night;</HI> which is called <HI>Chaos</HI> by the Poets.</P>
<P>To bring the matter of the Shield to Separation and Form, <HI>Vulcan</HI> presides over the Work, or as we may say, an <HI>essential Warmth: All things,</HI> says <HI>Heraclitus, being made by the Operation of Fire.</HI></P>

Thus in the Beginning of the World, he first lays the Earth as the Foundation of a Building, whose Vacancies are fill'd up with the Flowings of the Sea.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHIELD of <HI>ACHILLES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Poet intending to shew in its full Lustre, his Ge∣nius for Description, makes choice of this Interval from Action and the Leisure of the Night, to display that Talent at large in the famous Buckler of <HI>Achilles.</HI> His Intention was no less, than to draw the Picture of the whole World in the Compass of this Shield. We first see the Uni∣verse in general; the Heavens are spread, the Stars are hung up, the Earth is stretched forth, the Seas are pour'd round: We next see the World in a nearer and more particular view; the Cities, delightful in Peace, or formidable in War; the La∣bours of the Countrey, and the Fruit of those Labours, in the Harvests and the Vintages; the Pastoral Life in its Pleasures and its Dangers: In a word, all the Occupations, all the Am∣bitions, and all the Diversions of Mankind. This noble and comprehensive Design he has executed in a manner that chal∣leng'd the Admiration of all the Ancients: And how right an Idea they had of this grand Design, may be judg'd from that Verse of <HI>Ovid, Met.</HI> 13. where he calls it
<Q><L>—Clypeus <HI>vasti</HI> coelatus imagine <HI>mundi.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
It is indeed astonishing how after this the Arrogance of some Moderns could unfortunately chuse the noblest Part of the noblest Poet for the Object of their blind Criticisms.</P>
<P>I design to give the Reader the Sum of what has been said on this Subject. First, a Reply to the loose and scatter'd Objections of the Criticks, by M. <HI>Dacier:</HI> Then the regu∣lar Plan and Distribution of the Shield, by Mons. <HI>Boivin:</HI> And lastly, I shall attempt what has not yet been done, to consider it as a Work of <HI>Painting,</HI> and prove it in all re∣spects conformable to the most just Ideas and establish'd Rules of that Art.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>It is the Fate (says M. <HI>Dacier</HI>) of these Arms of <HI>Achilles,</HI> to be still the Occasion of Quarrels and Disputes. <HI>Julius Scaliger</HI> was the first who appear'd against this Part, and was follow'd by a whole Herd. These object in the first place, that 'tis impossible to represent the Movement of the Figures; and in condemning the manner, they take the Li∣berty to condemn also the Subject, which they say is trivial, and not well understood. 'Tis certain that <HI>Homer</HI> speaks of the Figures on this Buckler, as if they were alive: And some of the Ancients taking his Expressions to the Strictness of the Letter, did really believe that they had all sorts of Motion. <HI>Eustathius</HI> shewed the Absurdity of that Sentiment by a Passage of <HI>Homer</HI> himself, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Poet, says he, to shew that his Figures are not animated, as some have pre∣tended by an excessive Affection for the Prodigious, took care to say that they <HI>moved and fought,</HI> as if <HI>they were li∣ving Men.</HI>"</Q> The Ancients certainly founded this ridi∣culous Opinion on a Rule of <HI>Aristotle:</HI> For they thought the Poet could not make his Description more <HI>admirable</HI> and <HI>marvellous,</HI> than in making his Figures animated, since (as <HI>Aristotle</HI> says) the <HI>Original should always excel the Copy.</HI> That Shield is the Work of a God: 'Tis the Original, of which the Engraving and Painting of Men is but an imper∣fect Copy; and there is nothing impossible to the Gods. But they did not perceive, that by this <HI>Homer</HI> would have
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
fallen into an extravagant Admirable which would not have been probable. Therefore, 'tis without any Necessity <HI>Eu∣stathius</HI> adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That 'tis possible all those Figures did not stick close to the Shield, but that they were detach'd from it, and mov'd by Springs, in such a manner that they appear'd to have Motion; as <HI>Aeschylus</HI> has feign'd something like it, in his <HI>seven Captains against</HI> Thebes."</Q> But without having recourse to that C0onjecture, we can shew that there is nothing more simple and natural than the De∣scription of that Shield, and there is not one Word which <HI>Homer</HI> might not have said of it, if it had been the Work of a Man; for there is a great deal of difference between the Work itself, and the Description of it.</P>
<P>Let us examine the Particulars for which they blame <HI>Homer.</HI> They say he describes two Towns on his Shield which <HI>speak different Languages.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Latin</HI> Translati∣on, and not <HI>Homer,</HI> that says so; the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is a common Epithet of Men, and which signifies only, that they have <HI>an articulate Voice.</HI> These Towns could not speak different Languages, since, as the Ancients have re∣marked, they were <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Eleusina,</HI> both which spake the same Language. But tho' that Epithet should signify, <HI>which spake different Languages,</HI> there would be nothing very surprizing; for <HI>Virgil</HI> said what <HI>Homer</HI> it seems must not:<Q><L>Victae longo ordine gentes,</L>
<L>Quam variae linguis.—</L>
<BIBL>Aen. 8.</BIBL></Q> If a Painter should put into a Picture one Town of <HI>France</HI> and another of <HI>Flanders,</HI> might not one say they were two Towns which spake different Languages?</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> (they tell us) says in another place; that <HI>we hear the Harangues of two Pleaders.</HI> This is an unfair Exaggera∣tion: He only says, <HI>Two Men pleaded,</HI> that is, were represent∣ed pleading. Was not the same said by <HI>Pliny</HI> of <HI>Nicomachus,</HI> that he had painted two <HI>Greeks,</HI> which spake one after another? Can we express ourselves otherwise of these two Arts, which tho' they are mute, yet have a Language?
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
Or in explaining a Painting of <HI>Raphael</HI> or <HI>Poussin,</HI> can we prevent animating the Figures, in making them speak con∣formably to the Design of the Painter? But how could the Engraver represent those young Shepherds and Virgins that dance first in a Ring, and then in Setts? Or those Troops which were in Ambuscade? This would be difficult indeed if the Workman had not the Liberty to make his Persons appear in different Circumstances. All the Ob∣jections against the young Man who sings at the same time that he plays on the Harp, the Bull that roars whilst he is devoured by a Lion, and against the musical Consorts, are childish; for we can never speak of Painting if we banish those Expressions. <HI>Pliny</HI> says of <HI>Apelles,</HI> that he paint∣ed <HI>Clytus</HI> on Horseback going to Battel, and demanding his Helmet of his Squire: Of <HI>Aristides,</HI> that he drew a Beg∣gar whom we could almost understand, <HI>pene cum voce:</HI> Of <HI>Ctesilochus,</HI> that he had painted <HI>Jupiter</HI> bringing forth <HI>Bac∣chus,</HI> and crying out like a Woman, <HI>&amp; muliebriter ingemis∣centem:</HI> And of <HI>Nicearchus,</HI> that he had drawn a Piece, in which <HI>Hercules</HI> was seen very melancholy for having been a Fool, <HI>Herculem tristem, Insaniae poenitentiâ.</HI> No one sure will condemn those ways of Expression which are so common. The same Author has said much more of <HI>Apelles,</HI> he tells us, he painted those things which could not be painted, as Thunder; <HI>Pinxit quae pingi non possunt:</HI> And of <HI>Ti∣manthus,</HI> that in all his Works there was something more understood than was seen; and tho' there was all the Art imaginable, yet there was still more Ingenuity than Art: <HI>Atque in omnibus ejus operibus, intelligitur plus semper quàm pingitur; &amp; cùm Ars summa sit, Ingenium tamen ultra Ar∣tem est.</HI> If we take the pains to compare these Expressions with those of <HI>Homer,</HI> we shall find him altogether excusa∣ble in his <HI>Manner</HI> of describing the Buckler.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Matter.</HI> If this Shield (says a mo∣dern Critick) had been made in a wiser Age, it would have been more correct and less charg'd with Objects. There are two things which cause the Censurers to fall into this false Criticism: The first is, that they think the Shield was no broader than the brims of a Hat, whereas it was large enough
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
to cover a whole Man. The other is, that they did not know the Design of the Poet, and imagined this De∣scription was only the Whimsy of an irregular Wit, who did it by chance, and not following Nature; for they ne∣ver so much as enter'd into the Intention of the Poet, nor knew the Shield was design'd as a Representation of the Universe.</P>
<P>'Tis happy that <HI>Virgil</HI> has made a Buckler for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as well as <HI>Homer</HI> for <HI>Achilles.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Poet, who imitated the <HI>Greek</HI> one, always took care to accommodate those things which Time had chang'd, so as to render them agreeable to the Palate of his Readers; yet he hath not only charg'd his Shield with a great deal more Work, since he paints all the Actions of the <HI>Romans</HI> from <HI>Ascanius</HI> to <HI>Augustus;</HI> but has not avoided any of those manners of Expression which offend the Criticks. We see there the Wolf of <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus,</HI> who gives them her Dugs <HI>one after another, Mulcere alternos, &amp; Corpora fingere Linguâ:</HI> The Rape of the <HI>Sa∣bines</HI> and the War which follow'd it, <HI>subitoque novum con∣surgere Bellum: Metius</HI> torn by four Horses, and <HI>Tullus</HI> who draws his Entrails thro' the Forest: <HI>Porsenna</HI> com∣manding the <HI>Romans</HI> to receive <HI>Tarquin,</HI> and besieging <HI>Rome:</HI> The Geese flying to the Porches of the Capitol, and giving notice by their <HI>Cries</HI> of the Attack of the <HI>Gauls.</HI><Q><L>At{que} hic auratis volitans argenteus Anser,</L>
<L>Porticibus, Gallos in Limine adesse <HI>canebat.</HI></L></Q> We see the <HI>Salian</HI> Dance, Hell, and the Pains of the Damn'd; and farther off, the Place of the Blessed, where <HI>Cato</HI> pre∣sides: We see the famous Battel of <HI>Actium,</HI> where we may distinguish the Captains: <HI>Agrippa</HI> with the Gods, and the Winds favourable; and <HI>Anthony</HI> leading on all the Forces of the <HI>East, Egypt,</HI> and the <HI>Bactrians:</HI> The Fight begins, The Sea is red with Blood, <HI>Cleopatra</HI> gives the Signal for a Retreat, and calls her Troops with a <HI>Systrum. Patrio vocat agmina Systro.</HI> The Gods, or rather the Monsters of <HI>Egypt,</HI> fight against <HI>Neptune, Venus, Minerva, Mars</HI> and <HI>Apollo:</HI> We see <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Fleet beaten, and the <HI>Nile</HI> sorrowfully open∣ing
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
his Bosom to receive the Conquer'd: <HI>Cleopatra</HI> looks pale and almost dead at the Thought of that Death she had already determined; nay we see the very Wind <HI>Iapis,</HI> which hastens her Flight: We see the three Triumphs of <HI>Augustus;</HI> that Prince consecrates three hundred Temples, the Altars are fill'd with Ladies offering up Sacrifices, <HI>Au∣gustus</HI> sitting at the Entrance of <HI>Apollo</HI>'s Temple, receives Presents, and hangs them on the Pillars of the Temple; while all the conquer'd Nations pass by, who <HI>speak different Languages,</HI> and are differently equipp'd and arm'd.<Q><L>—Incedunt victae longo ordine Gentes,</L>
<L>Quam variae Linguis, habitu tum vestis &amp; armis.</L></Q> Nothing can better justify <HI>Homer,</HI> or shew the Wisdom and Judgment of <HI>Virgil:</HI> He was charm'd with <HI>Achilles</HI>'s Shield, and therefore would give the same Ornament to his Poem. But as <HI>Homer</HI> had painted the Universe, he was sensible that nothing remain'd for him to do; he had no other way to take than that of Prophecy, and shew what the Descendant of his Hero should perform; and he was not afraid to go beyond <HI>Homer,</HI> because there is nothing improbable in the Hands of a God. If the Criticks say, that this is ju∣stifying one Fault by another; I desire they would agree among themselves; for <HI>Scaliger,</HI> who was the first that con∣demn'd <HI>Homer</HI>'s Shield, admires <HI>Virgil</HI>'s; but suppose they should agree, 'twould be foolish to endeavour to persuade us, that what <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have done by the Appro∣bation of all Ages, is not good; and to make us think that their particular Taste should prevail over that of all other Men. Nothing is more ridiculous than to trouble one's self to an∣swer Men, who shew so little Reason in their Criticisms, that we can do them no greater Favour, than to ascribe it to their Ignorance.</P>
<P>Thus far the Objections are answer'd by Mons. <HI>Dacier.</HI> Since when, some others have been started, as that the Objects represented on the Buckler have no reference to the Poem, no Agreement with <HI>Thetis</HI> who procur'd it, <HI>Vul∣oan</HI> who made it, or <HI>Achilles</HI> for whom it was made.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
To this it is reply'd, that the Representation of the Sea was agreeable enough to <HI>Thetis;</HI> that the Spheres and celestial Fires were so to <HI>Vulcan;</HI> (tho' the truth is, any piece of Workmanship was equally fit to come from the Hands of this God) and that the Images of a Town besieg'd, a Bat∣tel, and an Ambuscade, were Objects sufficiently proper for <HI>Achilles.</HI> But after all, where was the Necessity that they should be so? They had at least been as fit for one Hero as for another; and <HI>Aeneas,</HI> as <HI>Virgil</HI> tells us, knew not what to make of the Figures on his Shield.<Q><L>Rerumque Ignarus, imagine gaudet.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>But still the main Objection, and that in which the Va∣nity of the Moderns has triumph'd the most, is, that the Shield is crowded with such a Multiplicity of Figures, as could not possibly be represented in the Compass of it. The late Dissertation of Mons. <HI>Boivin</HI> has put an end to this Cavil, and the Reader will have the Pleasure to be con∣vinced of it by ocular Demonstration, in the Print annexed.</P>
<P>This Author supposes the Buckler to have been perfectly round: He divides the convex Surface into four concentrick Circles.</P>
<P>The Circle next the Center contains the Globe of the Earth and the Sea, in miniature; He gives this Circle the Dimension of three Inches.</P>
<P>The second Circle is allotted for the Heavens and the Stars: He allows the Space of ten Inches between this, and the former Circle.</P>
<P>The third shall be eight Inches distant from the second. The Space between these two Circles shall be divided into twelve Compartiments, each of which makes a Picture of ten or eleven Inches deep.</P>
<P>The fourth Circle makes the Margin of the Buckler: And the Interval between this and the former, being of three Inches, is sufficient to represent the Waves and Currents of the Ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
All these together make but four Foot in the whole in Diameter. The Print of these Circles and Divisions will serve to prove, that the Figures will neither be crowded nor confused, if disposed in the proper Place and Order.</P>
<P>As to the Size and Figure of the Shield, it is evident from the Poets, that in the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War there were Shields of an extraordinary Magnitude. The Buckler of <HI>Ajax</HI> is often compar'd by <HI>Homer</HI> to a Tower, and in the sixth Iliad that of <HI>Hector</HI> is described to cover him from the Shoulders to the Ankles.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<BIBL>℣. 117.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>In the second Verse of the Description of this Buckler of <HI>Achilles,</HI> it is said that <HI>Vulcan</HI> cast round it a radiant Circle.<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L>
<BIBL>℣. 479.</BIBL></Q> Which proves the Figure to have been round. But if it be alledg'd that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as well signifies <HI>oval</HI> as <HI>circular,</HI> it may be answer'd, that the circular Figure better agrees to the Spheres represented in the Center, and to the Course of the Ocean at the Circumference.</P>
<P>We may very well allow four Foot Diameter to this Buck∣ler: As one may suppose a larger Size would have been too unwieldy, so a less would not have been sufficient to cover the Breast and Arm of a Man of a Stature so large as <HI>A∣chilles.</HI></P>
<P>In allowing four Foot Diameter to the whole each of the twelve Compartiments may be of ten or eleven Inches in Depth, which will be enough to contain, without any Confusion, all the Objects which <HI>Homer</HI> mentions. In∣deed in this Print, each Compartiment being but of one Inch, the principal Figures only are represented; but the Reader may easily imagine the Advantage of nine or ten Inches more. However, if the Criticks are not yet satisfy'd there is room enough, it is but taking in the literal Sense the Words <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, with which <HI>Homer</HI> begins his

<P>IT having been now shewn, that the Shield of <HI>Homer</HI> is blameless as to its Design and Disposition, and that the Subject (so extensive as it is) may be contracted within the due Limits; not being one vast unproportion'd Heap of Figures, but divided into twelve regular Compartiments.

<P>There is reason to believe that <HI>Homer</HI> did in this, as he has done in other Arts, (even in Mechanicks) that is, comprehend whatever was known of it in his Time; if not (as is highly probable) from thence extend his Ideas yet farther, and give a more enlarged Notion of it. Accordingly it is very ob∣servable, that there is scarce a Species or Branch of this Art which is not here to be found, whether History, Battel-Paint∣ing, Landskip, Architecture, Fruits, Flowers, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I think it possible that Painting was arrived to a greater Degree of Perfection, even at that early Period, than is ge∣nerally supposed by those who have written upon it. <HI>Pliny</HI> expresly says, that it was not known in the time of the <HI>Tro∣jan</HI> War. The same Author, and others, represent it in a very imperfect State in <HI>Greece,</HI> in, or near the Days of <HI>Ho∣mer.</HI> They tell us of one Painter, that he was the first who begun to shadow; and of another, that he fill'd his Outlines only with a single Colour, and that laid on every where alike: But we may have a higher Notion of the Art, from those Descriptions of Statues, Carvings, Tapestrys, Sculptures up∣on Armour, and Ornaments of all kinds, which every where occur in our Author; as well as from what he says of their Beauty, the Relievo, and their Emulation of Life itself. If we consider how much it is his constant Practice to confine himself to the Custom of the Times whereof he writ, it will be hard to doubt but that Painting and Sculpture must have been then in great Practice and Repute.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="140"/>
The Shield is not only describ'd as a Piece of Sculpture but of Painting; the Outlines may be suppos'd engraved, and the rest enamel'd, or inlaid with various-colour'd Metals. The Va∣riety of Colours is plainly distinguish'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> where he speaks of the <HI>Blackness</HI> of the new-open'd Earth, of the <HI>se∣veral Colours</HI> of the Grapes and Vines; and in other Places. The different Metals that <HI>Vulcan</HI> is feign'd to cast into the Furnace, were sufficient to afford all the necessary Colours: But if to those which are natural to the Metals, we add also those which they are capable of receiving from the Operation of Fire, we shall find, that <HI>Vulcan</HI> had as great a Variety of Colours to make use of as any modern Paint∣er. That Enamelling, or fixing Colours by Fire, was pra∣ctised very anciently, may be conjectur'd from what <HI>Dio∣dorus</HI> reports of one of the Walls of <HI>Babylon,</HI> built by <HI>Semi∣ramis,</HI> that <HI>the Bricks of it were painted before they were burn'd, so as to represent all sorts of Animals.</HI> lib. 2. chap. 4. Now it is but natural to infer, that Men had made use of ordinary Colours for the Representation of Objects, before they learnt to represent them by such as are given by the O∣peration of Fire; one being much more easy and obvious than the other, and that sort of Painting by means of Fire being but an Imitation of the Painting with a Pencil and Colours. The same Inference will be farther enforc'd from the Works of Tapestry, which the Women of those Times interweaved with many Colours; as appears from the De∣scription of that Veil which <HI>Hecuba</HI> offers to <HI>Minerva</HI> in the sixth Iliad, and from a Passage in the twenty second where <HI>Andromache</HI> is represented working Flowers in a Piece of this kind. They must certainly have known the Use of the Colours themselves for Painting, before they could think of dying Threads with those Colours, and weaving those Threads close to one another, in order only to a more la∣borious Imitation of a thing so much more easily perform'd by a Pencil. This Observation I owe to the <HI>Abbè Fraguier.</HI></P>
<P>It may indeed be thought, that a Genius so vast and com∣prehensive as that of <HI>Homer</HI> might carry his Views beyond the rest of Mankind, and that in this Buckler of <HI>Achilles</HI> he rather design'd to give a Scheme of what might be per∣form'd,
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
than a Description of what really was so: And since he made a God the Artist, he might excuse himself from a strict Confinement to what was known and practised in the Time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. Let this be as it will, it is certain that he had, whether by Learning, or by Strength of Genius, (tho' the latter be more glorious for <HI>Homer</HI>) a full and exact Idea of Painting in all its Parts; that is to say, in the <HI>Invention,</HI> the <HI>Composition,</HI> the <HI>Expression,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>Invention</HI> is shewn in finding and introducing, in every Subject, the <HI>greatest,</HI> the most <HI>significant,</HI> and most <HI>suitable</HI> Objects. Accordingly in every single Picture of the Shield, <HI>Homer</HI> constantly finds out either those Objects which are naturally the Principal, those which most conduce to shew the Subject, or those which set it in the liveliest and most agreeable Light: These he never fails to dispose in the most advantagious Manners, Situations, and Opposi∣tions.</P>
<P>Next, we find all his Figures differently <HI>characterized,</HI> in their Expressions and Attitudes, according to their several Natures: The Gods (for instance) are distinguish'd in Air, Habit, and Proportion, from Men, in the fourth Picture; Masters from Servants, in the eighth; and so of the rest.</P>
<P>Nothing is more wonderful than his exact Observation of the <HI>Contrast,</HI> not only between Figure and Figure, but between Subject and Subject. The City in Peace is a Con∣trast to the City in War: Between the Siege in the fourth Picture, and the Battel in the sixth, a piece of Paisage is introduced, and rural Scenes follow after. The Country too is represented in War in the fifth, as well as in Peace in the seventh, eighth, and ninth. The very Animals are shewn in these two different States, in the tenth and the eleventh. Where the Subjects appear the same, he contrastes them some other way: Thus the first Picture of the Town in Peace having a predominant Air of Gaiety, in the Dances and Pomps of the Marriage; the second has a Character of Earnestness and Sollicitude, in the Dispute and Pleadings. In the Pieces of rural Life, that of the Plowing is of a different Character from the Harvest, and that of the Harvest from the Vin∣tage. In each of these there is a Contrast of the <HI>Labour</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
and <HI>Mirth</HI> of the country People: In the first, some are plowing, others taking a Cup of good Liquor; in the next, we see the Reapers working in one part, and the Banquet prepar'd in another; in the last, the Labour of the Vine∣yard is reliev'd with Musick and a Dance. The Persons are no less varied, Old and Young, Men and Women: There being Women in two Pictures together, namely the eighth and ninth, it is remarkable that those in the latter are of a different Character from the former; they who dress the Sup∣per being ordinary Women, the others who carry Baskets in the Vineyard, young and beautiful Virgins: And these again are of an inferior Character to those in the twelfth Piece, who are distinguish'd as People of Condition by a more elegant Dress. There are three Dances in the Buckler; and these too are varied: That at the Wedding is in a circular Fi∣gure, that of the Vineyard in a Row, that in the last Picture, a mingled one. Lastly, there is a manifest Contrast in the Colours; nay, ev'n in the Back-Grounds of the several Pieces: For Example, that of the Plowing is of a dark Tinct, that of the Harvest yellow, that of the Pasture green, and the rest in like manner.</P>
<P>That he was not a Stranger to Aerial <HI>Perspective,</HI> appears in his expresly marking the Distance of Object from Object: He tells us, for instance, that the two Spies lay a little re∣mote from the other Figures; and that the Oak under which was spread the Banquet of the Reapers, stood apart. What he says of the Valley sprinkled all over with Cottages and Flocks, appears to be a Description of a large Country in Perspective. And indeed a general Argument for this may be drawn from the Number of Figures on the Shield; which could not be all express'd in their full Magnitude: And this is therefore a sort of Proof that the Art of lessening them according to Perspective was known at that Time.</P>
<P>What the Criticks call the <HI>three Unities,</HI> ought in reason as much to be observed in a Picture as in a Play; each should have only <HI>one principal Action,</HI> one <HI>Instant of Time,</HI> and one <HI>Point of View.</HI> In this Method of Examination also, the Shield of <HI>Homer</HI> will bear the Test: He has been more exact than the greatest Painters, who have often deviated from one or
<PB N="142" REF="143"/>
other of these Rules; whereas (when we examine the detail of each Compartiment) it will appear,</P>
<P>First, that there is but one principal Action in each Pi∣cture, and that no supernumerary Figures or Actions are in∣troduced. This will answer all that has been said of the Con∣fusion and Crowd of Figures on the Shield, by those who never comprehended the Plan of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, that no Action is represented in one Peice, which could not happen in the same Instant of Time. This will overthrow the Objection against so many different Acti∣ons appearing in one Shield; which, in this Case, is much as absurd as to object against so many of <HI>Raphael</HI>'s Cartons ap∣pearing in one Gallery.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It will be manifest that there are no Objects in any one Picture which could not be seen in one Point of View. Hereby the <HI>Abbè Terasson</HI>'s whole Criticism will fall to the Ground, which amounts but to this, that the gene∣ral Objects of the Heavens, Stars and Sea, with the parti∣cular Prospects of Towns, Fields, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> could never be seen all at once. <HI>Homer</HI> was incapable of so absurd a Thought, nor could these heavenly Bodies (had he intended them for a Picture) have ever been seen together from one Point; for the Constellations and the Full Moon, for example, could ne∣ver be seen at once with the Sun. But the celestial Bodies were placed on the Boss, as the Ocean at the Margin of the Shield: These were no Parts of the Painting, but the former was only an Ornament to the Projection in the middle, and the latter a Frame round about it: In the same manner as the Divisions, Projections, or Angles of a Roof are left to be ornamented at the Discretion of the Painter, with Fo∣liage, Architecture, Grotesque, or what he pleases: How∣ever his Judgment will be still more commendable, if he contrives to make even these extrinsical Parts, to bear some Allusion to the main Design: It is this which <HI>Homer</HI> has done, in placing a sort of Sphere in the middle, and the Ocean at the Border, of a Work, which was expressly intend∣ed to represent the Universe.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="144"/>
I proceed now to the Detail of the Shield; in which the Words of <HI>Homer</HI> being first translated, an Attempt will be made to shew with what exact Order all that he describes may enter into the Composition, according to the Rules of Painting.</P>

Their Wives, Children, and old Men were posted to defend the Walls: The Warriors march'd from the Town with</HI> Pallas <HI>and</HI> Mars <HI>at their Head: The Deities were of Gold, and had golden Armours, by the Glory of which they were distinguish'd above the Men, as well as by their superior Stature, and more elegant Proportions.</HI></P>
<P>This Subject may be thus disposed: The Town pretty near the Eye, a-cross the whole Picture, with the old Men on the Walls: The Chiefs of each Army on the Fore∣ground: Their different Opinions for putting the Town to the Sword, or sparing it on account of the Booty, may be express'd by some having their Hands on their Swords, and looking up to the City, others stopping them, or in an Acti∣on of persuading against it. Behind, in Prospect, the Towns∣men may be seen going out from the back Gates, with the two Deities at their Head.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> here gives a clear Instance of what the Ancients always practised; the distinguishing the Gods and Goddesses by Characters of Majesty or Beauty somewhat superior to Nature; we constantly find this in their Statues, and to this the modern Masters owe the grand Taste in the Perfection of their Figures.</P>

<P><HI>THETIS</HI> brings to her Son the Armour made by <HI>Vulcan.</HI> She preserves the Body of his Friend from Corrupti∣on, and commands him to assemble the Army, to de∣clare his Resentment at an end. <HI>Agamemnon</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> are solemnly reconcil'd: The Speeches, Presents, and Ceremo∣nies on that Occasion. <HI>Achilles</HI> is with great Difficulty per∣suaded to refrain from the Battel till the Troops have refresh'd themselves, by the Advice of <HI>Ulysses.</HI> The Presents are con∣vey'd to the Tent of <HI>Achilles;</HI> where <HI>Briseis</HI> laments over the Body of <HI>Patroclus.</HI> The Hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to Lamentations for his Friend. <HI>Minerva</HI> descends to strengthen him, by the Order of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> He arms for the Fight; his Appearance described. He addresses him∣self to his Horses, and reproaches them with the Death of <HI>Patroclus.</HI> One of them is miraculously endued with Voice, and inspir'd to prophecy his Fate; but the Hero, not astonish'd by that Prodigy, rushes with Fury to the Combate.</P>

But that Office was regarded by <HI>Homer,</HI> and by all the <HI>Greeks</HI> of his time, as a pious Duty consecrated by Custom and Religion; which obliged the Kindred and Friends of the
<PB N="180" REF="179"/>
Deceas'd to watch his Corps, and prevent any Corruption before the solemn Day of his Funerals. It is plain this De∣voir was thought an indispensable one, since <HI>Achilles</HI> could not discharge himself of it but by imposing it upon his Mo∣ther. It is also clear, that in those times the Preservation of a dead Body was accounted a very important Matter, since the Goddesses themselves, nay the most delicate of the God∣desses, made it the Subject of their utmost Attention. As <HI>Thetis</HI> preserves the Body of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and chases from it those In∣sects that breed in the Wounds and cause Putrefaction, so <HI>Venus</HI> is employ'd Day and Night about that of <HI>Hector,</HI> in driving away the Dogs to which <HI>Achilles</HI> had expos'd it. <HI>Apollo,</HI> on his part, covers it with a thick Cloud, and pre∣serves its Freshness amidst the greatest Heats of the Sun: And this Care of the Deities over the Dead was look'd upon by Men as a Fruit of their Piety.</P>
<P>There is an excellent Remark upon this Passage in <HI>Bossu</HI>'s admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem, lib. 3. c. 10. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To speak (says this Author) of the Arts and Sciences as a Poet ought, we should veil them under Names and Actions of Persons fictitious and allegorical. <HI>Homer</HI> will not plainly say that Salt has the Virtue to preserve dead Bodies, and prevent the Flies from engendering Worms in them; he will not say, that the Sea presented <HI>Achilles</HI> a Remedy to pre∣serve <HI>Patroclus</HI> from Putrefaction; but he will make the Sea a Goddess, and tell us, that <HI>Thetis</HI> to comfort <HI>Achil∣les,</HI> engaged to perfume the Body with an Ambrosia which shou'd keep it a whole Year from Corruption: It is thus <HI>Homer</HI> teaches the Poets to speak of Arts and Scien∣ces. This Example shews the Nature of the things, that Flies cause Putrefaction, that Salt preserves Bodies from it; but all this is told us poetically, the whole is reduced into Action, the Sea is made a Person who speaks and acts, and this <HI>Prosopopoeia</HI> is accompanied with Passion, Tenderness and Affection; in a word, there is nothing which is not (according to <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Precept) endued with Manners.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 197. <HI>The stern</HI> Aeacides <HI>replies.</HI>]</Q> The <HI>Greek</HI> Verse is
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q>
Which is repeated very frequently throughout the Iliad. It is a very just Remark of a <HI>French</HI> Critick, that what makes it so much taken notice of, is the rumbling Sound and Length of the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: This is so true, that if in a Poem or Romance of the same Length as the Iliad, we should re∣peat <HI>The Hero answer'd,</HI> full as often, we should never be sen∣sible of that Repetition. And if we are not shock'd at the like Frequency of those Expressions in the Aeneid, <HI>sic ore re∣fert, talia voce resert, talia dicta dabat, vix ea fatus erat,</HI> &amp;c. it is only because the Sound of the <HI>Latin</HI> Words does not fill the Ear like that of the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>The Discourse of the same Critick upon these sort of Re∣petitions in general, deserves to be transcribed. That useless Nicety (says he) of avoiding every Repetition which the Delicacy of later Times has introduced, was not known to the first Ages of Antiquity: The Books of <HI>Moses</HI> abound with them. Far from condemning their frequent Use in the most ancient of all the Poets, we should look upon them as the certain Character of the Age in which he liv'd: They spoke so in his Time, and to have spoken otherwise had been a Fault. And indeed nothing is in itself so contrary to the true Sublime, as that painful and frivolous Exactness, with which we avoid to make use of a proper Word because it was us'd before. It is certain that the <HI>Romans</HI> were less scrupulous as to this point: You have often in a single Page of <HI>Tully,</HI> the same Word five or six times over. If it were really a Fault, it is not to be conceiv'd how an Author who so little wanted Variety of Expressions as <HI>Homer,</HI> could be so very negligent herein? On the contrary, he seems to have affected to repeat the same Things in the same Words, on many Occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="183"/>
It was from two Principles equally true, that among seve∣ral People, and in several Ages, two Practices entirely diffe∣rent took their Rise. <HI>Moses, Homer,</HI> and the Writers of the first Times, had found that Repetitions of the same Words recall'd the Ideas of Things, imprinted them much more strongly, and render'd the Discourse more intelligible. Upon this Principle, the Custom of repeating Words, Phrases, and even entire Speeches, insensibly establish'd itself both in Prose and in Poetry, especially in Narrations.</P>
<P>The Writers who succeeded them observ'd, even from <HI>Ho∣mer</HI> himself, that the greatest Beauty of Style consisted in Variety. This they made their Principle: They therefore avoided Repetitions of Words, and still more of whole Sen∣tences; they endeavour'd to vary their Transitions; and found out new Turns and Manners of expressing the same Things.</P>
<P>Either of these Practices is good, but the Excess of either vicious: We should neither on the one hand, thro' a Love of Simplicity and Clearness, continually repeat the same Words, Phrases, or Discourses; nor on the other, for the Pleasure of Variety, fall into a childish Affectation of expressing every thing twenty different Ways, tho' it be never so natu∣ral and common.</P>
<P>Nothing so much cools the Warmth of a Piece or puts out the Fire of Poetry, as that perpetual Care to vary in∣cessantly even in the smallest Circumstances. In this, as in many other Points, <HI>Homer</HI> has despis'd the ungrateful Labour of too scrupulous a Nicety. He has done like a great Painter, who does not think himself oblig'd to vary all his Pieces to that degree, as not one of 'em shall have the least Resemblance to another: If the principal Figures are entirely different, we easily excuse a Resemblance in the Landscapes, the Skies, or the Draperies. Suppose a Gallery full of Pictures, each of which represents a particular Subject: In one I see <HI>Achilles</HI> in Fury, menacing <HI>Agamemnon;</HI> in another the same Hero with regret delivers up <HI>Briseis</HI> to the Heralds; in a third 'tis still <HI>Achilles,</HI> but <HI>Achilles</HI> overcome with Grief, and lament∣ing to his Mother. If the Air, the Gesture, the Counte∣nance, the Character of <HI>Achilles,</HI> are the same in each of
<PB N="185" REF="184"/>
these three Pieces; if the Ground of one of these be the same with that of the others in the Composition and general De∣sign, whether it be Landscape, or Architecture; then indeed one should have reason to blame the Painter for the Uni∣formity of his Figures and Grounds. But if there be no Same∣ness but in the Folds of a few Draperies, in the Structure of some part of a Building, or in the Figure of some Tree, Mountain, or Cloud, it is what no one would regard as a Fault. The Application is obvious: <HI>Homer</HI> repeats, but they are not the great Strokes which he repeats, not those which strike and fix our Attention: They are only the little Parts, the Transitions, the general Circumstances, or familiar Images, which recur naturally, and upon which the Reader but casts his Eye carelesly: Such as the Descriptions of Sacrifices, Re∣pasts, or Embarquements; such in short, as are in their own Nature much the same, which it is sufficient just to shew, and which are in a manner incapable of different Orna∣ments.</P>

This forces <HI>Ulysses</HI> to repeat that Advice, and insist upon it so much: Which these Criticks did not see into, who thro' a false De∣licacy are shock'd at his insisting so warmly on Eating and Drinking.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 5. <HI>Then</HI> Jove <HI>to</HI> Themis <HI>gives Command,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> The Poet is now to bring his Hero again into Action, and he introduces him with the utmost Pomp and Grandeur: The Gods are assembled only upon this account, and <HI>Jupiter</HI> permits several Deities to join with the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and hinder <HI>Achilles</HI> from over-ruling Destiny itself.</P>
<P>The Circumstance of sending <HI>Themis</HI> to assemble the Gods is very beautiful; she is the Goddess of Justice; the <HI>Trojans</HI> by the Rape of <HI>Helen,</HI> and by repeated Perjuries having bro∣ken her Laws, she is the properest Messenger to summon a Synod to bring them to punishment. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Proclus</HI> has given a farther Explanation of this. <HI>Themis</HI> or <HI>Justice</HI> (says he) is made to assemble the Gods round <HI>Ju∣piter,</HI> because it is from him that all the Powers of Nature take their Virtue, and receive their Orders; and <HI>Jupiter</HI> sends them to the Relief of both Parties, to shew that no∣thing

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 15. <HI>All but old Ocean.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Eustathius</HI> gives two Reasons why <HI>Oceanus</HI> was absent from this Assembly: The one is be∣cause he is fabled to be the Original of all the Gods, and it would have been a peice of Indecency for him to see the Deities, who were all his Descendents, war upon one another by join∣ing adverse Parties: The other Reason he draws from the Allegory of <HI>Oceanus,</HI> which signifies the Element of Water, and consequently the whole Element could not ascend into the Aether; But whereas <HI>Neptune,</HI> the Rivers, and the Fountains are said to have been present, this is no way im∣possible, if we consider it in an allegorical Sense, which im∣plies, that the Rivers, Seas, and Fountains supply the Air with Vapours, and by that means ascend into the Aether.</P>

Those who condemned <HI>Homer,</HI> said <HI>Jupiter</HI> was for the <HI>Trojans;</HI> he saw the <HI>Greeks</HI> were the strongest, so permitted the Gods to declare themselves and go to the Battel. But therein that God is deceived, and does not gain his Point; for the Gods who favour the <HI>Greeks</HI> being stronger than those who favour the <HI>Trojans,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> will still have the same Advantage. I do not know what Answer the Par∣tisans of <HI>Homer</HI> made, but for my part, I think this Obje∣ction is more ingenious than solid. <HI>Jupiter</HI> does not pre∣tend
<PB N="227" REF="224"/>
that the <HI>Trojans</HI> shou'd be stronger than the <HI>Greeks,</HI> he has only a mind that the Decree of Destiny should be exe∣cuted. Destiny had refused to <HI>Achilles</HI> the Glory of taking <HI>Troy,</HI> but if <HI>Achilles</HI> fights singly against the <HI>Trojans,</HI> he is capable of forcing Destiny; as <HI>Homer</HI> has already elsewhere said, that there had been brave Men who had done so. Whereas if the Gods took part, tho those who followed the <HI>Grecians</HI> were stronger than those who were for the <HI>Trojans,</HI> the latter wou'd however be strong enough to sup∣port Destiny, and to hinder <HI>Achilles</HI> from making himself Master of <HI>Troy:</HI> This was <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s sole View.

Mons. <HI>de la Motte</HI> criticizes on this Passage, as thinking it absurd and contradictory to <HI>Homer</HI>'s own System, to imagine, that what Fate had ordained should not come to pass. <HI>Ju∣piter</HI> here seems to fear that <HI>Troy</HI> will be taken this very Day in spite of Destiny, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. M. <HI>Boivin</HI> answers, that the Explication hereof depends wholly upon the Principles of the ancient Pagan Theology and their Doctrine concern∣ing Fate. It is certain, according to <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> that which Destiny had decreed did not constantly happen in the precise Time mark'd by Destiny, the fatal Moment was not to be retarded, but might be hastened: For example, that of the Death of <HI>Dido</HI> was advanced by the Blow she gave herself; her Hour was not then come.<Q><L>—Nec fato, merita nec morte peribat,</L>

it. And the same might be said of any Misfortunes which Men drew upon themselves by their own ill Conduct. (See the 37<SUP>th</SUP> Note on lib. 16.) In a word, it must be al∣lowed that it was not easy, in the Pagan Religion, to form the juses Ideas upon a Doctrine so difficult to be clear'd; and upon which it is no great wonder if a Poet should not always be perfectly consistent with himself, when it has puzzel'd such a Number of Divines and Philosophers.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 174. <HI>Advanc'd upon the Field there stood a Mound,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> It may not be unnecessary to explain this Passage to make it un∣derstood by the Reader: The Poet is very short in the De∣scription, as supposing the Fact already known, and hastens to the Combat between <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>Aeneas.</HI> This is very judicious in <HI>Homer</HI> not to dwell on a piece of History that had no relation to his Action, when he has rais'd the Rea∣der's Expectation by so pompous an Introduction, and made the Gods themselves his Spectators.</P>
<P>The Story is as follows. <HI>Laomedon</HI> having defrauded <HI>Neptune</HI> of the Reward he promis'd him for the building the Walls of <HI>Troy, Neptune</HI> sent a monstrous Whale, to which <HI>Laomedon</HI> exposed his Daughter <HI>Hesione:</HI> But <HI>Hercules</HI> having undertaken to destroy the Monster, the <HI>Trojans</HI> rais'd an Intrenchment to defend <HI>Hercules</HI> from his Pursuit: This being a remarkable piece of Conduct in the <HI>Trojans,</HI> it gave occasion to the Poet to adorn a plain Narration with Ficti∣on by ascribing the Work to <HI>Pallas</HI> the Goddess of Wisdom. <HI>Eustathius.</HI></P>

themselves Spectators? I conceive the reason of this Conduct in the Poet to be, that <HI>Achilles</HI> has been inactive during the greatest part of the Poem; and as he is the Hero of it, ought to be the chief Character in it: The Poet there∣fore withdraws the Gods from the Field that <HI>Achilles</HI> may have the whole Honour of the Day, and not act in subor∣dination to the Deities: Besides, the Poem now draws to a Conclusion, and it is necessary for <HI>Homer</HI> to enlarge upon the Exploits of <HI>Achilles,</HI> that he may leave a noble Idea of his Valour upon the Mind of the Reader.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 214, &amp;c. <HI>The Conversation of</HI> Achilles <HI>and</HI> Aeneas.]</Q> I shall lay before the Reader the Words of <HI>Eustathius</HI> in de∣fence of this Passage, which I confess seems to me to be faulty in the Poet. The Reader (says he) would naturally expect some great and terrible Atchievements should ensue from <HI>Achilles</HI> upon his first entrance upon Action. The Poet seems to prepare us for it, by his magnificent Introduction of him into the Field: But instead of a Storm, we have a Calm; he follows the same Method in this Book as he did in the third, where when both Armies were ready to en∣gage in a general Conflict, he ends the Day in a single Com∣bate between two Heroes: Thus he always agreeably sur∣prizes his Readers. Besides the Admirers of <HI>Homer</HI> reap a farther Advantage from this Conversation of the Heroes: There is a Chain of ancient History as well as a Series of poetical Beauties.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>Dacier</HI>'s Excuse is very little better: And to shew that this is really a Fault in the Poet, I believe I may appeal to the Taste of every Reader who certainly finds himself dis∣appointed: Our Expectation is rais'd to see Gods and Heroes engage, when suddenly it all sinks into such a Combat in which neither Party receive a Wound; and (what is more ex∣traordinary) the Gods are made the Spectators of so small an Action! What occasion was there for Thunder, Earthquakes, and descending Deities, to introduce a Matter of so little Im∣portance?
<PB N="233" REF="230"/>
Neither is it any Excuse to say he has given us a peice of ancient History; We expected to read a Poet, not an Historian. In short, after the greatest Preparation for Action imaginable, he suspends the whole Narration, and from the Heat of a Poet, cools at once into the Simplicity of an Historian.</P>

This Testimony of <HI>Homer</HI> ought to be look'd upon as an authentick Act, the Fidelity and Verity whereof cannot be questioned. <HI>Neptune,</HI> as much an Enemy as he is to the <HI>Trojans,</HI> declares that <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and after him his Posterity, shall reign over the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Wou'd <HI>Homer</HI> have put this Prophecy in <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Mouth, if he had not known that <HI>Aeneas</HI> did not leave <HI>Troy,</HI> that he reigned therein, and if he had not seen in his Time the Descendants of that Prince reign there likewise? That Poet wrote 260 Years, or there∣abouts, after the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> and what is very remar∣kable he wrote in some of the Towns of <HI>Ionia,</HI> that is to say, in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Phrygia,</HI> so that the Time and Place give such a Weight to his Deposition that nothing can invalidate it. All that the Historians have written concern∣ing <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Voyage into <HI>Italy,</HI> ought to be consider'd as a Romance, made on purpose to destroy all historical Truth, for the most ancient is posterior to <HI>Homer</HI> by many Ages. Before <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus,</HI> some Writers being sen∣sible of the Strength of this Passage of <HI>Homer,</HI> undertook to explain it so as to reconcile it with this Fable, and they said that <HI>Aeneas,</HI> after having been in <HI>Italy,</HI> return'd to <HI>Troy,</HI> and left his Son <HI>Ascanius</HI> there. <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Halicarnassus,</HI> little satisfy'd with this Solution, which did not seem to him to be probable, has taken another Method: He would have it that by these Words, <Q REND="inline">"He shall reign over the <HI>Trojans,</HI></Q> <HI>Homer</HI> meant, he shall reign over the <HI>Trojans</HI> whom he shall carry with him into <HI>Italy.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it not possible, says he, that <HI>Aeneas</HI> should reign over the <HI>Trojans,</HI> whom he had taken with him, though settled elsewhere?</Q></P>
<P>That Historian, who wrote in <HI>Rome</HI> itself, and in the very Reign of <HI>Augustus,</HI> was willing to make his Court to that Prince, by explaining this Passage of <HI>Homer</HI> so as to favour the Chimaera he was possess'd with. And this is a Reproach that may with some Justice be cast on him; for Poets may by their Fictions flatter Princes and welcome: Tis their Trade. But for Historians to corrupt the Gravity and Se∣verity of History, to substitute Fable in the place of Truth, is what ought not to be pardon'd. <HI>Strabo</HI> was much more religious, for though he wrote his Books of Geography to∣wards

<L>Then rising in his Rage above the Shores,</L>
<L>From all his Deeps the bellowing River roars,</L>
<L N="260">Huge Heaps of Slain disgorges on the Coast,</L>

<L>The God pursues, a huger Billow throws,</L>

<L>The Man whose Fury is the Fate of <HI>Troy.</HI></L>

<L>And winds his Course before the following Tide;</L>
<L>The Waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,</L>
<L>And gather fast, and murmur at his Heels.</L>
<L N="290">So when a Peasant to his Garden brings</L>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Book is entirely different from all the fore∣going: Tho' it be a Battel, it is entirely of a new and surprizing kind, diversify'd with a vast Variety of Imagery and Description. The Scene is totally chang'd, he paints the Combate of his Hero with the Rivers, and describes a Battel amidst an Inundation. It is observable that tho' the whole War of the Iliad was upon the Banks of these Rivers, <HI>Homer</HI> has artfully left out the Machinery of River-Gods in all the other Battels, to aggran∣dize this of his Hero. There is no Book of the Poem that has more force of Imagination, or in which the great and inexhausted Invention of our Author is more powerfully exerted. After this Description of an Inundation, there fol∣lows a very beautiful Contrast in that of the Drought: The Part of <HI>Achilles</HI> is admirably sustain'd, and the new Strokes which <HI>Homer</HI> gives to his Picture are such as are deriv'd from the very source of his Character, and finish the entire Draught of this Hero.</P>
<P>How far all that appears wonderful or extravagant in this Episode, may be reconcil'd to Probability, Truth, and na∣tural
<PB N="282" REF="277"/>
Reason, will be consider'd in a distinct Note on that Head: The Reader may find it on ℣. 447.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 14. <HI>As the scorch'd Locusts,</HI> &amp;c.]</Q> <HI>Eustathius</HI> ob∣serves that several Countries have been much infested with Armies of Locusts; and that, to prevent their destroying the Fruits of the Earth, the Countrymen by kindling large Fires drove them from their Fields; the Locusts to avoid the in∣tense Heat were forc'd to cast themselves into the Water. From this Observation the Poet draws his Allusion which is very much to the Honour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> since it represents the <HI>Trojans</HI> with respect to him as no more than so many Insects.</P>
<P>The same Commentator takes notice, that because the Island of <HI>Cyprus</HI> in particular was us'd to practise this Method with the Locusts, some Authors have conjectur'd that <HI>Homer</HI> was of that Country; but if this were a sufficient Reason for such a Supposition, he might be said to be born in almost all the Countries of the World, since he draws his Observations from the Customs of them all.</P>
<P>We may hence account for the innumerable Armies of these Locusts, mention'd among the Plagues of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> without having recourse to an immediate Creation, as some good Men have imagin'd, whereas the Miracle indeed con∣sists in the wonderful manner of bringing them upon the <HI>Aegy∣ptians:</HI> I have often observ'd with Pleasure the Similitude which many of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Expressions bear with the holy Scri∣ptures, and that the oldest Writer in the World except <HI>Moses</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="278"/>
often speaks in the Idiom of <HI>Moses:</HI> Thus as the Locusts in <HI>Exodus</HI> are said to be driven into <HI>the Seas,</HI> so in <HI>Homer</HI> they are forc'd into <HI>a River.</HI></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 34. <HI>Now tir'd with Slaughter.</HI>]</Q> This is admirably well suited to the Character of <HI>Achilles,</HI> his Rage bears him headlong on the Enemy, he kills all that oppose him, and stops not till Nature itself could not keep pace with his An∣ger; he had determin'd to reserve twelve noble Youths to sacrifice them to the <HI>Manes</HI> of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> but his Resentment gives him no time to think of them, till the hurry of his Passion abates, and he is tir'd with Slaughter: Without this Circumstance, I think an Objection might naturally be rais'd, that in the time of a Pursuit <HI>Achilles</HI> gave the Enemy too much Leisure to escape, while he busy'd himself with tying these Prisoners: Tho' it is not absolutely necessary to suppose he did this with his own Hands.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 35. <HI>Twelve chosen Youths.</HI>]</Q> This piece of Cruelty in <HI>Achilles</HI> has appear'd shocking to many, and indeed is what I think can only be excus'd by considering the ferocious and vindictive Spirit of this Hero. 'Tis however certain that the
<PB N="284" REF="279"/>
Cruelties exercis'd on Enemies in War were authoriz'd by the military Laws of those Times; nay Religion itself be∣came a Sanction to them. It is not only the fierce <HI>Achilles,</HI> but the pious and religious <HI>Aeneas,</HI> whose very Character is Virtue and Compassion, that reserves several young unfortunate Captives taken in Battel, to sacrifice them to the <HI>Manes</HI> of his favourite Hero. <HI>Aen.</HI> 10. ℣. 517.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 41. <HI>The young</HI> Lycaon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>]</Q> <HI>Homer</HI> has a won∣derful Art and Judgment in contriving such Incidents as set the characteristick Qualities of his Heroes in the highest point of Light. There is hardly any in the whole Iliad more pro∣per to move Pity than this Circumstance of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> or to raise Terror, than this View of <HI>Achilles.</HI> It is also the finest Picture of them both imaginable: We see the different Atti∣tude of their Persons, and the different Passions which ap∣pear'd in their Countenances: At first <HI>Achilles</HI> stands erect, with Surprize in his Looks, at the Sight of one whom he thought it impossible to find there; while <HI>Lycaon</HI> is in the Posture of a Suppliant, with Looks that plead for Compassi∣on;
<PB N="285" REF="280"/>
with one Hand holding the Hero's Lance, and his Knee with theother: Afterwards, when at his Death he lets go the Spear and places himself on his Knees, with his Arms ex∣tended, to receive the mortal Wound; how lively and how strongly is this painted? I believe every one perceives the Beauty of this Passage, and allows that Poetry (at least in <HI>Homer</HI>) is truly a speaking Picture.</P>

<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 84, <HI>&amp;c. The Speeches of</HI> Lycaon <HI>and</HI> Achilles.]</Q> It is impossible for any thing to be better imagin'd than these two Speeches; that of <HI>Lycaon</HI> is moving and compassionate, that of <HI>Achilles</HI> haughty and dreadful; the one pleads with the utmost Tenderness, the other denies with the utmost Stern∣ness: One would think it impossible to amass so many moving Arguments in so few Words as those of <HI>Lycaon:</HI> He forgets no Circumstance to soften his Enemy's Anger, he flatters the Memory of <HI>Patroclus,</HI> is afraid of being thought too nearly related to <HI>Hector,</HI> and would willingly put himself upon him as a Suppliant, and consequently as an inviolable person: But <HI>Achilles</HI> is immoveable, his Resentment makes him deaf to Entreaties, and it must be remember'd that Anger, not Mercy, is his Character.</P>
<P>I must confess I could have wish'd <HI>Achilles</HI> had spared him: There are so many Circumstances that speak in his Favour, that he deserv'd his Life, had he not ask'd it in Terms a lit∣tle too abject.</P>
<P>There is an Air of Greatness in the Conclusion of the Speech of <HI>Achilles,</HI> which strikes me very much: He speaks very unconcernedly of his own Death, and upbraids his Enemy for asking Life so earnestly, a Life that was of so much less Importance than his own.</P>

Nothing can give a better Idea of <HI>Homer</HI>'s manner of en∣livening his inanimate Machines, and of making the plainest and simplest Incidents noble and poetical, than to consider the whole Passage in the common historical Sense, which I suppose to be no more than this. There happen'd a great Overflow of the River <HI>Xanthus</HI> during the Seige, which very much in∣commoded the Assailants: This gave occasion for the Fiction of an Engagement between <HI>Achilles</HI> and the River-God: <HI>Xanthus</HI> calling <HI>Simois</HI> to assist him, implies that these two neighbouring Rivers join'd in the Inundation: <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>Neptune</HI> relieve <HI>Achilles;</HI> that is, <HI>Pallas,</HI> or the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>Achilles,</HI> found some means to divert the Waters, and turn them into the <HI>Sea;</HI> wherefore <HI>Neptune,</HI> the God of it, is feign'd to assist him. <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> (by which are un∣derstood the aerial Regions) consent to aid <HI>Achilles;</HI> this may signify, that after this great Flood their happen'd a warm, dry, windy Season, which asswaged the Waters, and dried the Ground: And what makes this in a manner plain, is, that <HI>Juno</HI> (which signifies the <HI>Air</HI>) promises to send the
<PB N="292" REF="287"/>
<HI>North</HI> and <HI>West Winds</HI> to distress the River. <HI>Xanthus</HI> being consum'd by <HI>Vulcan,</HI> that is dried up with Heat, prays to <HI>Juno</HI> to relieve him: What is this, but that the Drought having almost drunk up his Streams, he has recourse to the <HI>Air</HI> for Rains to resupply his Current? Or perhaps the whole may signify no more, than that <HI>Achilles</HI> being on the farther side of the River, plung'd himself in to pursue the Enemy; that in this Adventure he run the risk of being drown'd; that to save himself he laid hold on a fallen Tree, which serv'd to keep him afloat; that he was still carried down the Stream to the Place where was the Confluence of the two Rivers, which is express'd by the one calling the other to his Aid; and that when he came nearer the Sea [<HI>Neptune</HI>] he found means by his Prudence <HI>(Pallas)</HI> to save himself from his Danger.</P>
<P>If the Reader still should think the Fiction of Rivers speak∣ing and fighting is too bold, the Objection will vanish by considering how much the Heathen Mythology authorizes the Representation of Rivers as Persons: Nay even in old Histo∣rians nothing is more common than Stories of Rapes com∣mitted by River-Gods: And the Fiction was no way unpre∣sidented, after one of the same nature so well known, as the Engagement between <HI>Hercules</HI> and the River <HI>Achelous.</HI></P>

<P>The Poet has describ'd many of his Heroes in former parts of his Poem, as throwing Stones of enormous Bulk and Weight; but here he rises in his Image: He is describing a Goddess, and has found a way to make that Action excel all human Strength, and be equal to a Deity.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> has imitated this Passage in his twelfth Book, and apply'd it to <HI>Turnus;</HI> but I can't help thinking that the acti∣on in a Mortal is somewhat extravagantly imagined: What principally renders it so, is an Addition of two Lines to this Simile which he borrows from another part of <HI>Homer,</HI> only with this difference, that whereas <HI>Homer</HI> says no two Men could raise such a Stone, <HI>Virgil</HI> extends it to twelve.

<P><Q REND="inline">VERSE 508. <HI>The God of Ocean, and the God of Light.</HI>]</Q> The Interview between <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> is very judiciously in this place enlarged upon by our Author. The Poem now draws to a Conclusion, the <HI>Trojans</HI> are to be punish'd for their Perjury and Violence: <HI>Homer</HI> accordingly with a poe∣tical Justice sums up the Evidence against them, and repre∣sents the very Founder of <HI>Troy</HI> as an injurious person. There have been several References to this Story since the Begin∣ning of the Poem, but he forbore to give it at large till near the end of it; that it might be fresh upon the Memory, and shew, the <HI>Trojans</HI> deserve the Punishment they are about to suffer.</P>
<P><HI>Eustathius</HI> gives the reason why <HI>Apollo</HI> assists the <HI>Trojans,</HI> tho' he had been equally with <HI>Neptune</HI> affronted by <HI>Laome∣don:</HI> This proceeded from the Honours which <HI>Apollo</HI> re∣ceiv'd from the Posterity of <HI>Laomedon; Troy</HI> paid him no less Worship than <HI>Cilla,</HI> or <HI>Tenedos;</HI> and by these means won him over to a Forgiveness: But <HI>Neptune</HI> still was slighted, and consequently continued an Enemy to the whole Race.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="290"/>
The same Author gives us various Opinions why <HI>Neptune</HI> is said to have built the <HI>Trojan</HI> Wall, and to have been de∣frauded of his Wages: Some say that <HI>Laomedon</HI> sacrilegiously took away the Treasures out of the Temples of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Neptune,</HI> to carry on the Fortifications: From whence it was fabled that <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> built the Walls. Others will have it, that two of the Workmen dedicated their Wages to <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Neptune;</HI> and that <HI>Laomedon</HI> detained them: So that he might in some sense be said to defraud the Deities themselves, by with-holding what was dedicated to their Temples.</P>
<P>The reason why <HI>Apollo</HI> is said to have kept the Herds of <HI>Laomedon</HI> is not so clear: <HI>Eustathius</HI> observes that all Plagues first seize upon the four-footed Creation, and are suppos'd to arise from this Deity: Thus <HI>Apollo</HI> in the first Book sends the Plague into the <HI>Grecian</HI> Army: The Ancients therefore made him to preside over Cattel, that by preserving them from the Plague, Mankind might be safe from infectious Diseases. Others tell us, that this Employment is ascrib'd to <HI>Apollo,</HI> because he signifies the Sun: Now the Sun cloaths the Pastures with Grass and Herbs: So that <HI>Apollo</HI> may be said himself to feed the Cattel, by supplying them with Food. Upon either of these accounts <HI>Laomedon</HI> may be said to be ungrateful to that Deity, for raising no Temple to his Honour.</P>
<P>It is observable that <HI>Homer</HI> in this Story ascribes the build∣ing of the Wall to <HI>Neptune</HI> only: I should conjecture the reason might be, that <HI>Troy</HI> being a Sea-port Town, the chief Strength of it depended upon its Situation, so that the Sea was in a manner a Wall to it: Upon this account <HI>Neptune</HI> may not improbably be said to have built the Wall.</P>

<P>Yet I think it but reasonable to conclude, from the very Absurdity of all this, supposing it had no hidden Meaning or Allegory, that there must therefore certainly be some. Nor do I think it any Inference to the contrary, that it is too ob∣scure for us to find out: The Remoteness of our Times must necessarily darken yet more and more such Things as were My∣steries at first.

<P>Here again there was need of another <HI>Machine</HI> to hinder him from entring the City; for <HI>Achilles</HI> being vastly speedier than those he pursued, he must necessarily overtake some of them, and the narrow Gates could not let in a body of Troops without his mingling with the hindmost.
