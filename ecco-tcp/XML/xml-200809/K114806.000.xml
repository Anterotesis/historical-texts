<HEAD>JOHN the SHOPKEEPER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LONG has the Muse her tale delay'd,</L>
<L>Has stopt to talk of Johnny's trade;</L>
<L>Wife, daughter, mother too, of John,</L>
<L>And quite forgot to travel on.</L>
<L>Long has the Muse with trembling fear,</L>
<L>View'd the sad scene that now is near;</L>
<L>Hung back indeed from very fright,</L>
<L>And shrunk and started at the sight.</L>
<L>As the tall steed, if he should spy</L>
<L>Some unknown form of danger nigh,</L>
<L>Starts from his path, his eye-balls glare,</L>
<L>His feet fly prancing in the air,</L>
<L>Round on the spot and round he wheels,</L>
<L>Upright upon his meer hind heels;</L>
<L>So have we started at the view</L>
<L>Of what our John is now to do,</L>
<L>Have gaily frisk'd it round and round,</L>
<L>Nor gain'd as you an inch of ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, gentle Muse, the tale declare,</L>
<L>Sing how this bold advent'rous pair,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
With mother brave and willing daughter,</L>
<L>March'd to the borders of the water.</L>
<L>Sing how they trod the beech so steep,</L>
<L>Gaz'd at the wonders of the deep,</L>
<L>And stopt to view, as in a trance,</L>
<L>The awful ocean's vast expanse,</L>
<L>Then gaz'd at ev'ry passing boat,</L>
<L>Till they quite long'd to get on float.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>The Boatmen, as they cross the Strand,</L>
<L>Spring from an alehouse just at hand,</L>
<L>All on the party down they burst,</L>
<L>And each is sure that he was first.</L>
<L>Oh! how they press and fill the ground,</L>
<L>And push and elbow all around!</L>
<L>Each to a Lady makes his suit,</L>
<L>Till Nancy starts as at a brute:</L>
<L>While prudent Johnny marching down,</L>
<L>Hires a snug boat for half a crown,</L>
<L>Of smaller size, but stiff and tight;</L>
<L>And having seen that all is right,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Rallies his daughter, claims his wife,</L>
<L>Bursts thro' the crowd and ends the strife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now with self-complacent grin,</L>
<L>The favor'd Boatman hands them in;</L>
<L>But first he plants, as is his rule,</L>
<L>On the wave's edge his little stool,</L>
<L>And while he begs them to take care,</L>
<L>Presents his elbow high in air.</L>
</LG>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<LG>
<L>All in they stept, all down they sat;</L>
<L>All safe, all even, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat:</L>
<L>The Boatman pushes off the boat;</L>
<L>Was e'er such treasure all afloat!</L>
<L>And now amid the sun's bright gleam,</L>
<L>See how they cut the silver stream!</L>
<L>See how the breeze begins to play!</L>
<L>See how it wafts them far away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had the party left the shore,</L>
<L>When Ruffman longs to spare his oar,</L>
<L>Points to the bench where lies a sail,</L>
<L>And begs to profit by the gale.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
At first the Boatman's words appal,</L>
<L>And all the female faces fall;</L>
<L>And Madam bets ten thousand pound,</L>
<L>"This instant we shall be drown'd."</L>
<L>Mean time old Ruffman, with a sneer,</L>
<L>Forbids each vain and silly fear;</L>
<L>Talks of the seas that he hath cross'd,</L>
<L>Beaten, and blown, and tempest tost;</L>
<L>Tells of his dangers, now no more,</L>
<L>While a green youth in days of yore,</L>
<L>Of feats perform'd by way of fun,</L>
<L>And boasts of matches he has won:</L>
<L>Then drops his tone, and quite allays</L>
<L>All the new fears he seem'd to raise;</L>
<L>Pleads his great care, asserts his skill,</L>
<L>Begs each dear Lady'll dread no ill;</L>
<L>For if he keeps the rope in hand,</L>
<L>The water's just as safe as land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all objections down he beat,</L>
<L>And now the awful sail is set;</L>
<L>Ah, how they plough the whit'ning seas,</L>
<L>So fine so glorious is the breeze;</L>
<L>How fresh and cooling too the air,</L>
<L>While the sail shades them from the glare;</L>
<L>The Boatman, who a while before</L>
<L>Sat coatless heated at the oar,</L>
<L>Now lolls his ease, observes the wind,</L>
<L>Steers with one careful hand behind;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
While his right fist holds hard the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>Resists or humours well the gale;</L>
<L>Then half-appearing to turn back,</L>
<L>At once he stops and makes a tack;</L>
<L>Points at the distant and once more,</L>
<L>And seems to run you right ashore;</L>
<L>But ere he lets you quite touch ground,</L>
<L>Again he spins his vessel round,</L>
<L>And shifts across, with skill so nice,</L>
<L>The flutt'ring canvas in a trice;</L>
<L>Scuds o'er the spacious seas again;</L>
<L>Again he plows the mighty main;</L>
<L>Again the less'ning shore retires,</L>
<L>Woods, hills depart, and distant spires;</L>
<L>While the bright sun, yon clouds between,</L>
<L>Shines forth and gilds the glorious scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The party, eas'd of all their fright,</L>
<L>Gaze round and round with sweet delight;</L>
<L>Praise with one voice both land and seas,</L>
<L>And now they languish for a breeze;</L>
<L>Dread lest the slack'ning wind should fail,</L>
<L>And welcome every growing gale:</L>
<L>Swift o'er the swelling waves they fly,</L>
<L>And pleasure beams in ev'ry eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, ah! how oft with genial fun,</L>
<L>While the gay course of life we run,</L>
<L>And fancy as we taste the treat,</L>
<L>Our human bliss is now compleat;—</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
How oft in that same favor'd hour,</L>
<L>Does the whole sky begin to lour!</L>
<L>The cheering sun-shine's pass'd away,</L>
<L>There comes a dreary doleful day:</L>
<L>Afflictions gather like a cloud;</L>
<L>The swelling tempest roars aloud;</L>
<L>While from yon threat'ning heav'ns so dark,</L>
<L>It thunders round our little bark:</L>
<L>Unskill'd to struggle thro' the breeze,</L>
<L>We toss in new and troubled seas,</L>
<L>And life's gay morning all so bright,</L>
<L>Ends in some woeful tale at night,</L>
