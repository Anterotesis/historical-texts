<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT OF THE EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE two Volumes we now offer to the Public contain what was comprised in the former edition of three Volumes.—The ad∣ditional lines and alterations will be noticed in their proper place. In the first edition of these Poems, the Author concludes his Preface with these words,—<HI>It is with great diffidence that I add my literary Mite to the Treasury of English Poetry.</HI>—In analogy to this humble metaphor, we will venture to
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>assert, that the Mite is no counterseit coin; that it is not debased by an admixture of any improper alloy; and that it came from the Poetic Mint impressed with the Image of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE MAGDALEN Charity was established in the year 1758. A commodious habitation was engaged, in PRESCOT STREET, by the promoters of this be∣nevolent institution, and the house was opened on the tenth of August, when eight unhappy objects were admitted.</P>
<P>In the year 1772, the Charity was removed to a more spacious building in ST. GEORGE'S FIELDS.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAGDALENS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEE to yon fane the suppliant Nymphs repair,</L>
<L>At Virtue's shrine to breathe Contrition's sigh:</L>
<L>Their youthful cheek is pal'd with early care,</L>
<L>And sorrow dwells in their dejected eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! they awake a solemn plaintive lay,</L>
<L>Where Grief with Harmony delights to meet:</L>
<L>Not Philomela from her lonely spray,</L>
<L>Trills her clear note more querulously sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<L>Are these the fair (late Pleasure's Festive quire)</L>
<L>Who wont the dome of Luxury to tread?</L>
<L>Who deck'd in varying fashion's new attire,</L>
<L>Still vied in splendor with the high-born Maid?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For sober weeds they change their flowing train,</L>
<L>Of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm,</L>
<L>Conceal the breast that glow'd in ev'ry vein,</L>
<L>And madden'd into joy at Love's alarm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah now no more the diamond's dazzling ray</L>
<L>Darts from the artful mazes of the hair;</L>
<L>No more those tresses garishly display</L>
<L>The idle plumes that sportive mock'd the air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet Beauty lingers on their mournful brow,</L>
<L>As loth to leave the cheek suffus'd with tears,</L>
<L>Which scarcely blushing with a languid glow,</L>
<L>Like Morn's faint beam thro' gath'ring mist appears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<L>No more compare them to the gaudy flow'r,</L>
<L>Whose painted foliage wantons in the gale:</L>
<L>They look the lily drooping from the show'r,</L>
<L>Or the pale violet sick'ning in the vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If fond of empire and of conquest vain,</L>
<L>They frequent vot'ries to their altars drew,</L>
<L>Yet blaz'd those dazz'ling altars to their bane,</L>
<L>The idol they, and they the victim too!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once destitute of counsel, aid, or food,</L>
<L>Some helpless orphans in this dome reside,</L>
<L>Who (like the wand'ring children in the wood)</L>
<L>Trod the rude paths of life without a guide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some who encircled by the great and rich</L>
<L>Were won by wiles and deep-designing art,</L>
<L>By splendid bribes, and soft persuasive speech,</L>
<L>Of pow'r to cheat the young unguarded heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<L>Some on whom Beauty breath'd her radiant bloom,</L>
<L>While adverse stars all other gifts remov'd;</L>
<L>Who hurried from the dungeon's living tomb,</L>
<L>To scenes their inborn virtue disapprov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tho' their youth imbib'd an early stain,</L>
<L>A second innocence is now their claim;</L>
<L>While in the precincts of this blesss'd domain,</L>
<L>They bask beneath the rays of rising Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So the young myrtles in Misfortune's day,</L>
<L>Nipt by the blast that swept their vernal bed,</L>
<L>In shelt'ring walls their tender leaves display,</L>
<L>And wak'ning into life new fragrance shed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' white-wing'd Peace protect this calm abode,</L>
<L>Tho' each tumultuous passion be suppress'd,</L>
<L>Still Recollection wears a sting to goad,</L>
<L>Still Conscience wakes to rob their soul of rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
<L>See one the tort'ring hour of mem'ry prove,</L>
<L>Who wrapt in pensive secrecy forlorn,</L>
<L>Sits musing on the pledges of her love,</L>
<L>Who fell the victims of paternal scorn:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgot, deserted in th' extremeft need,</L>
<L>By him who shou'd have rear'd their tender age:</L>
<L>'Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd meed?'</L>
<L>She cries—then finks beneath Affliction's rage:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her busy mind recalls the fatal plain,</L>
<L>Which with slow lab'ring steps she journey'd o'er,</L>
<L>Half-yielding to the fierce impetuous rain,</L>
<L>While in her arms two helpless babes she bore:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her mind recalls how at that awful hour</L>
<L>The dismal Owlet scream'd her shiv'ring note,</L>
<L>How shriek'd the Spirit from the haunted tow'r,</L>
<L>While other sounds of woe were heard remote:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
<L>How to the covert of a tott'ring shed,</L>
<L>As Night advanc'd, she fearfully retir'd;</L>
<L>And as around the dark'ning horror spread,</L>
<L>Her famish'd infants on her breast expir'd:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How keenest Anguish bade her bosom bleed,</L>
<L>As there she brooded o'er her hapless state:</L>
<L>'Was this, Seducer, this the promis'd meed?'</L>
<L>She cries—then sinks beneath Affliction's weight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another mourns her fall with grief sincere.</L>
<L>Whom tranquil Reason tells she's shun'd, disdain's</L>
<L>Repuls'd as vile, by those who held her dear,</L>
<L>Who call'd her once Companion, Sister, Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That recollects the day when lost to shame,</L>
<L>She fondly sacrific'd her vestal charms,</L>
<L>Resign'd the virgin's for an harlot's name</L>
<L>And left a parent's for a spoiler's arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
<L>Imagination pictures to her mind</L>
<L>The father's rage, the mother's softer woe:</L>
<L>Unhappy pair! to that distress consign'd,</L>
<L>A child can give, a parent only know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this deep scene, by Fancy drawn, imprefs'd,</L>
<L>The filial passions in her heart revive:</L>
<L>Reproach vindictive, rushes on her breast,</L>
<L>To Nature's pangs too feelingly alive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If this, or similar tormenting thought,</L>
<L>Cling to their soul, when pensively alone,</L>
<L>For youth's offence, for Love's alluring fault,</L>
<L>Say, do they not sufficiently atone?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem me one of Melancholy's train,</L>
<L>If anxious for the sorrow-wedded Fair,</L>
<L>Tho' little skilful of that heav'nly strain,</L>
<L>Whose melting numbers to the heart repair:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<L>I steal impatient from the idle throng,</L>
<L>The roving gay companions of my age,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This poem was first published in 1763.</NOTE></L>
<L>To temper with their praise my artless song,</L>
<L>And soft-ey'd Pity in their cause engage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis Virtue's task to soothe Affliction's smart,</L>

<P>INKLE is preparing to set out for England, after hav∣ing sold YARICO to a merchant at Barbadoes, 'not∣withstanding 'that the poor Girl, (says the Spec∣tator) 'to incline him to commiserate her condition, 'told him that she was with child by him: but he 'only made use of that information, to rise in his 'demands upon the purchaser.'</P>

<HEAD>YARICO to INKLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WITH falsehood lurking in thy sordid breast,</L>
<L>And perj'ry's seal upon thy heart imprest,</L>
<L>Dar'st thou, Oh Christian! brave the sounding waves,</L>
<L>The treach'rous whirlwinds, and untrophied graves?</L>
<L>Regardless of my woes, securely go,</L>
<L>No curse-sraught accents from these lips shall flow:</L>
<L>My fondest wish shall catch thy flying sail,</L>
<L>Attend thy course, and urge the fav'ring gale:</L>
<L>May ev'ry bliss thy God confers be thine,</L>
<L>And all thy share of woe compris'd in mine.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="20"/>One humble boon is all I now implore,</L>
<L>Allow these feet to print their kindred shore:</L>
<L>Give me, Oh Albion's son! again to roam,</L>
<L>For thee deserted, my delightful home:</L>
<L>To view the groves that deck my native scene,</L>

<L>Ascend the throne which I forsook for thee:</L>

<L>The scenes the hand of Time has thrown behind,</L>

<L>'What hostile vessel quits the roaring tide</L>
<L>'To harbour here its tempest-beaten side?</L>
<L>'Behold the beach receives the shipwreck'd crew:</L>
<L>'Oh mark their strange attire and pallid hue!</L>
<L>'Are these the Christians, restless sons of pride,</L>
<L>'By avarice nurtur'd, to deceit allied?</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="21"/>'Who tread with cunning step the maze of art,</L>
<L>'And mask with placid looks a canker'd heart?</L>
<L>'Yet note, superior to the num'rous throng,</L>

<L>'That Youth!—Lo! beauty on his graceful brow,</L>
<L>'With nameless charms bids ev'ry feature glow:</L>
<L>'Ah! leave, fair stranger, this unsocial ground,</L>

<L>'He comes! he comes! th' ambrosial feast prepare,</L>
<L>The fig, the palm-juice, nor th' anana spare:</L>

<L>The scented foliage of the blushing spring:</L>
<L>Ye graceful handmaids, dress the roseat bow'r,</L>
<L>And hail with music this auspicious hour—</L>
<L>Ah no! forbear—be ev'ry lyre unstrung,</L>

<L>'And mortals then enjoy life's transient day,</L>
<L>'When smit with passion they indulge the sway;</L>
<L>'Yes! crown'd with bliss, we'll roam the conscious grove,</L>
<L>'And drink long draughts of unexhausted love:</L>
<L>'Nor joys alone, thy dangers too I'll share,</L>
<L>'With thee the menace of the waves I'll dare:</L>
<L>'In vain—for smiles his brow deep frowns involve,</L>

<L>'His fading vow's while tainted zephyrs bear!'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh thou, before whose seraph-guarded throne</L>
<L>The Christians, bow, and other Gods disown,</L>
<L>If, wrapt in darkness, thou deny'st thy ray,</L>
<L>And shround'st from NUBIA thy celestial day!</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="23"/>Indulge this fervent pray'r, to thee address'd,</L>

<L>The grateful accents of thy praiseful tongue,</L>

<P>CHRISTIERN the Second, king of Denmark, offered to appear in person at Stockholm, to frame a treaty of peace, provided GUSTAVUS VASA remained a hostage on board the Danish fleet. The king having by this stratagem secured the illustrious Swede, forcibly carried him away to Denmark, where he was impri∣soned for a considerable time. GUSTAVUS at length found means of escaping from his confinement; and travelling through Sweden in disguise, was received by SUVERDSIO, a poor country curate, who, at the ha∣zard of his life, concealed him in the parish church, and informed him of every thing that had happened in Sweden during his absence, particularly of the mas∣sacre of the senate at Stockholm, in which the father of GUSTAVUS was included.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>ARABERT, a young ecclesiastic, retired to the convent of LA TRAPPE, in obedience to a vow he had taken during a fit of illness: LEONORA, with whom he had lived in the strictest intimacy, followed her lover, and by the means of a disguise, obtained admission into the monastery, where a few days after she assisted at her lo∣ver's Funeral.</P>

<HEAD>THE FUNERAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAIR LEONORA, by Affliction led,</L>
<L>Sought the dread dome where sleep the hallow'd dead:</L>
<L>The solemn edifice was wrapt around</L>
<L>In midnight darkness, and in peace profound:</L>
<L>A solitary lamp, with languid light,</L>
<L>Serv'd not to chase, but to disclose the night;</L>
<L>Serv'd to disclose (the source of all her pains)</L>
<L>The tomb that gap'd for ARABERT'S remains:</L>
<L>To this, she sent the deep, the frequent sigh,</L>
<L>And spoke—the warm tear rushing from her eye.</L>
</LG>

<L>'Doom'd to receive all that my soul holds dear,</L>
<L>'Give him that rest his heart refus'd him here:</L>

<L>'The train of sorrows that from passion flow!</L>

<L>As thus she mourn'd, an aged priest drew near,</L>
<L>(Whose pure life glided as the riv'let clear)</L>
<L>The virtuous ANSELM.—Tho' in cloisters bred,</L>
<L>Still bright-ey'd Wisdom to his cell he led:</L>
<L>From paths of sophistry he lov'd to stray,</L>
<L>To tread the walk where Nature led the way.</L>
<L>The Prior's rank he long had held approv'd,</L>
<L>Esteem'd, rever'd, and as a parent lov'd:</L>
<L>Unskilful in the jargon of the schools,</L>
<L>He knew Humanity's diviner rules;</L>
<L>To others gentle, to himself severe,</L>
<L>On Sorrow's wound he dropt the healing tear.</L>
<L>In all the negligence of grief, he found</L>
<L>The fair extended on the naked ground.</L>
<L><PB N="87" REF="92"/>Touch'd at her woe, the sacred Father said,</L>

<L>'Some much-lov'd friend in him you must deplore,</L>

<L>'Say, cannot Death my daring crime atone?</L>
<L>'Ah, let Compassion now your hearts inspire,</L>

<P>The Wake is of very great antiquity in this country. It was held on the day of the Dedication, that is, on the day of the saint to whom the village church was dedicated. Booths were erected in the church-yard and on the adjacent plain, and after divine service the rest of the time was devoted to the occupations of the fair, to merriment and festivity.</P>
<P>See BOURNE's Antiquities of the Common People, with Observations by Mr. BRAND.</P>

<L>HARK! how the merry, merry bells resound,</L>
<L>To summon to the Wake the hamlets round:</L>
<L>The villagers, in all their best array,</L>
<L>Go forth to celebrate the festive day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now from the moat-encircled castle came</L>
<L>An aged Chief, who grac'd the roll of Fame:</L>
<L>Who knows not,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A celebrated character in the reign of HENRY the Third.</NOTE> CHESTER'S Earl, to worth ally'd,</L>
<L>The boast of chivalry, and valour's pride?</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="155"/>From courts and busy camps at length retir'd,</L>
<L>To deeds of Fame no longer he aspir'd:</L>
<L>Pleas'd, far sequester'd from the voice of praise,</L>
<L>To give to peace his last remaining days,</L>
<L>And while life's hour-glass near its period stands,</L>
<L>To watch and pray beside the closing sands.</L>
<L>But, 'mid the stillness of retirement's shade,</L>
<L>Domestic sorrow on his bosom prey'd:</L>
<L>A Daughter, fram'd his favor to engage,</L>
<L>Pride of his house, and soother of his age,</L>
<L>Her native mansion had abruptly fled—</L>
<L>The veil of darkness o'er the rest was spread.</L>
<L>Oft of his child some welcome news to gain</L>
<L>The tortur'd Father sought, but sought in vain.</L>
<L>He strives (this day) his sorrows to beguile,</L>
<L>And hide his anguish with a sickly smile.</L>

<L>The hoary Pastor, near the village-fane,</L>
<L>Receiv'd the honour'd Chief and all his train:</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="156"/>This holy, meek, disinterested man</L>

<L>But to the humble cot's neglected door</L>
<L>The sacred man the balm of comfort bore:</L>
<L>Still would he listen to the injur'd swain,</L>
<L>For he who listens mitigates the pain:</L>
<L>There was he seen reclining o'er the bed,</L>
<L>Where the pale maiden bow'd her anguish'd head;</L>
<L>Where, reft of hope, the yielding victim lay,</L>
<L>And like a wreath of snow dissolv'd away:</L>

<L>Where the meek train of silent grief retir'd,</L>

<L>'YE hallow'd bells, whose voices thro' the air</L>
<L>'The awful summons of affliction bear:</L>
<L>'Ye slowly-waving banners of the dead,</L>
<L>'That o'er yon altar your dark horrors spread:</L>
<L>'Ye curtain'd lamps, whose mitigated ray</L>
<L>'Casts round the fane a pale, reluctant day:</L>
<L>'Ye walls, ye shrines, by Melancholy drest,</L>
<L>'Well do ye suit the fashion of my breast!</L>
<L>'Have I not lost what language can't unfold,</L>
<L>'The form of Valour, cast in Beauty's mould?</L>
<L>'Th' intrepid Youth the path of battle tried,</L>
<L>'And foremost in the hour of peril died.</L>

<L>'But other duties, other cares impend,</L>
<L>'Cares that beyond the mournful grave extend:</L>
<L>'Now, now I view conven'd the pious train,</L>
<L>'Whose bosom sorrows at another's pain,</L>
<L>'While recollection, pleasingly severe,</L>
<L>'Wakes for the awful dead the silent tear,</L>
<L>'And pictures (as to each her sway extends)</L>
<L>'The sacred forms of lovers, parents, friends.</L>
<L>'Now Charity a fiery seraph stands</L>
<L>'Beside yon altar with uplifted hands.</L>
