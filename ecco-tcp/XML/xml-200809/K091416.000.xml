<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. FAWCET.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Enter, driving a boy across the stage.</STAGE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>AWAY! 'Sblood! Run for the Author! We can do nothing till he appears.</L>
<L>Tell him in less than five minutes we shall have the house about our ears!</L>
</LG>
<STAGE>[To the audience.]</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>Oh sirs! The prompter has mislaid the prologue, and we are all a mort,</L>
<L>I suppose our friends above yonder will soon be making pretty sport;</L>
<L>For pity's sake, suffer us to go on without it—Good, dear sirs, do!</L>
<L>'Twas most abominably dull—Zounds! There stands the writer. Well, It's very true.</L>
<L>One of our te tum ti heroes was to have spoken it, who measure nonsense out by the yard;</L>
<L>And our chief hope was you'd make too much noise for it to be heard.</L>
<L>The author had mounted on the stilts of oratory and elocution:</L>
<L>Not but he had a smart touch or two, about Poland, France, and the—the revolution;</L>
<L>Telling us that Frenchman, and Polishman, and every man is our brother▪</L>
<L>And that all men, ay, even poor negro men, have a right to be free one as well as another!</L>
<L>Freedom at length, said he, like a torrent is spreading and swelling,</L>
<L>To sweep away pride and reach the most miserable dwelling:</L>
<L>To ease happiness, art, science, wit, and genius to give birth▪</L>
<L>Ay, to fertilize a world, and renovate old earth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus he went on, not mentioning a word about the play:</L>
<L>For he says prologues are blots, which ought to be wiped away:</L>
<L>A gothic practice, and in spite of precedent, not the better for being old,</L>
<L>For, if we tell any part of the plot, it then becomes a tale twice told,</L>
<L>And such twice telling can rarely once excite our wonder:</L>
<L>Ergo, he that says nothing is least likely to blunder.</L>
<L>Since therefore prologues are bad things at best, pray, my good friends,</L>
<L>Never mind the want of one, but live in hopes the play will make amends.</L>

<P>Very well, sir.</P>

<P>But it's over! His name has this very day been struck out of the firm! Let his drafts be returned. It's all ended! <STAGE>[Passionately]</STAGE> And observe, not a guinea!

<P>Sir!—Certainly not▪ except in obedience to your orders!</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha! What the widow Warren?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil,</SPEAKER>
<P>She seems to think and even reports you are to marry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry? Her? A coquette of forty, who ridicu∣lously apes all the airs of a girl! Fantastic, selfish and a fool! And marry? Disgusting idea! Thou wert philo∣sophising as we drove on the condition of a post-horse—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>

<P>I would rather be a post-horse, nay the rascal that drives a post-horse, than the base thing thou hast imagined!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then why are you so often there?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har</SPEAKER>
<P>What a question! Am I not a profligate, and in all probability ruined?—Not even my father can over∣look this last affair—No,—Heigho;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The loss of my father's will, and the mystery made of its contents by those who witnessed it, are strange circumstances!</P>

<P>In which the widow triumphs. And you being a bastard, and left by law to starve, she willingly pays obedience to laws so wise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>She refuses even to pay my debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har</SPEAKER>
<P>And the worthy alderman, your father, being overtaken by death in the south of France, carefully makes a will, and then as carefully hides it where it is not to be found; or commits it to the custody of some mercenary knave, who has made his market of it to the widow—So! here comes the supposed executor of this supposed will.</P>

<P>Nay now, Mr Dornton, that is not right of you! I am never offended with any body, and I am sure I should not be offended with you! my grandma' always said I was the best tempered girl in the world—What is it?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Because—Because I am but a girl—my grandma' has told me a hundred times, it's a sin for any body to be in love before they be a woman grown, full one-and twenty; and I am not eighteen!</P>

<P>Nah—, I can't say but I did think—! in Glou∣cestershire, if any young man happen to have a liking for a young woman, she is sure to hear of it on Valen∣tine day. But perhaps Valentine day does not fall so soon here as it does in the country;</P>

<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay now, but don't you go to think that I am asking for one; for that would be very wrong of me, and I know better—my grandma' told me I must never mention nor think of such things till I am a woman, full one-and-twenty grown; and that if I were to find such a thing at my window, or under my pillow or con∣cealed in a plumcake—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plum-cake?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Soph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: I assure you I have heard of a valentine sent baked in a plum-cake—And so <Q>if I had one that I must shew it to her. But you know she is in Glou∣cestershire; And I am sure I would not shew it to ma' for though she is all out and above forty, she would be as jealous as the vengeance! And indeed</Q> I would not receive such a thing for the world, no not from the finest man on earth, if I did not think him to be a true and faithful, true, true lover,</P>
</SP>

<P>But how must he prove his faith and truth?</P>

<P>His darling madam!—With your permission, I will just read a single clause in which his darling is men∣tioned! Look, madam; it is thealderman's hand! <STAGE>[Reads]</STAGE> <Q>But as I have sometimes painfully suspected the exces∣sive affection which my said wife, Winifred Warren, professed for me during my decline, and that the so∣lemn protestations she made never to marry again▪ should she survive me, were both done with sinister views, it is my will that, should she marry, or give a legal promise of marriage, written or verbal, that she shall be cut off with an annuity of six hundred a year; and the residue of my effects in that case to be equally divided between my natural son, John Milford, and my wife's daughter, Sophia Freelove.</Q></P>

<P>Six hundred a year! An old dotard! <Q>To ima∣gine that a woman of my elegant ideas could exist on six hundred a year!</Q> Brute! Monster! I hate him now as heartily as when he was alive: But pray, sir, how came you by this will?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sil.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gentleman that delivered it only made a mis∣take of a letter, and give it to Mr. Silky instead of to Mr. Sulky!</P>

<P>You are a very shocking old miser▪ Mr Silky! A very repulsive sort of a person! What heart you had is turned to stone! You are insensible of the power of a pair of fine eyes! But I have made a conquest that places me beyond your reach—I mean to marry Mr Dornton!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha▪ ha, ha! Young Mr Dornton!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you may take your will and light your fires with it! You will not make a penny of it in any other way. Mr. Sulky, the executor is Mr. Dornton's partner, and when I marry Mr Dornton he will never inflict the absurd penalty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! No, madam! When you marry Mr Dornton, that he certainly never will! But if any acci∣dent should happen to prevent the match, you will then let me here from you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord▪ good man! Don't mention the horrid idea? Do leave me to my delightful meditations! I would indulge in soft sensibility and dreams of bliss; and not be disturbed by dead men's wills, or the sordid extorti∣ons of an avaricious old rogue!</P>

<P>Your son, sir, made me what I am; redeemed me and my family from ruin; and it would be an ill re∣quital of his goodness to come here, like a dun, at such a time as this; when I would rather, if that could help him, give him every shilling I have in the world,</P>

<P>What can be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must hide ourselves somewhere, and spring upon them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hate hiding! It's deceit, and deceit is the re∣source of a rascal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mil.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is no avoiding it! We cannot get legal assistance in time! Here are two closets! Do you go into one, and I'll shut myself up in the other. We shall hear what they are about, and can burst upon them at the proper moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it must be so—But it's a vile, paltry refuge!</P>

<P>Well, well, I'm ready—I'll not long interrupt your amorous haste. I am a man of business! I expected how it would be, and have a legal instrument here, ready drawn up by my own hand; which, when it is signed and sealed, will make all safe!</P>

<P>Old one! You're done up!</P>

<P>Harry—Give me your hand—You have a gene∣rous and a noble nature! But your generosity would have proved more pernicious than even your dissipation. No misfortunes, no not the beggary and ruin of a father, could justify so unpricipled a marriage!</P>
