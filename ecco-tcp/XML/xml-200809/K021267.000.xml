<L>TRITE seems our Author's Task, when all Creation</L>
<L>Obey the Maxims of <HI>Retaliation.</HI></L>
<L>The old, the young, the rich, poor, great, and small,</L>
<L>Are governe'd by <HI>retorting</HI> one and all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord Dangle would intrigue to cut a Figure,</L>
<L>For Treach'ry makes your Folks of Rank look bigger—</L>
<L>My Lady's stung, and so, 'twixt Vice and Whim</L>
<L>Intrigues—and thus <HI>retaliates</HI> on him.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Jane, was a Draper's Wife, and Jane within her</L>
<L>Felt strong Temptation to become a Sinner;</L>
<L>Not from Caprice nor Whim—but mark—th' Event is</L>
<L>She lik'd, and scarce knew why—the elder 'Prentice—</L>
<L>The Husband hears, and cursing at the Slur,</L>
<L>Resolves to break his vow as well as her—</L>
<L>So lifts his Maid to fill his Spouse's Station,</L>
<L>A blessed Instance of <HI>Retaliation.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor yet to private Life confine this Notion,</L>
<L>It spreads expansive as the boundless Ocean:</L>
<L><HI>Retaliate,</HI> speaks the hostile Cannon's roar—</L>
<L><HI>Retaliate</HI> echo's from the British Shore—</L>
<L>The Genius of the Isle is now awake,</L>
<L>Speaks like brave Russel, frowns like noble Blake;</L>
<L>Calls forth such Spirits, as of <HI>old</HI> were known,</L>
<L>When <HI>England's King</HI> was crown'd on <HI>Gallia</HI>'s Throne—</L>
<L>When Holland pray'd to succour her, distrest,</L>
<L>And Spanish Pride had struck her lofty Crest.</L>
<L>"Vict'ry" she says "shall smile, fell Discord cease,</L>
<L>"And War produce the Olive Branch of <HI>Peace.</HI></L>
<L>"Britain secure from all <HI>intestine</HI> Harms,</L>
<L>"Is confident against the <HI>World</HI> in Arms.</L>
<L>"<HI>Now, British Minds,</HI> with <HI>British Hearts</HI> unite,</L>
<L>"Mature the Council, and direct the Fight:</L>
<L>"<HI>Again</HI> shall Britain mighty Deeds perform,</L>
<L>"Ride on the Whirlwind, and direct the Storm;</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
"Serenely brave, smile while the Thunder's hurl'd,</L>
<L>"And <HI>undivided,</HI> face the threat'ning World."</L>

<L>To Strains so hold our Author <HI>dare</HI> not rise—</L>
<L>He views <HI>that Ardor</HI> glowing in <HI>your</HI> Eyes.</L>
<L>There needs no "Muse of Fire" to rouse the Nation,</L>
<L>You're all united for <HI>Retaliation.</HI></L>

<L>His ardent Wish is—that you like his Ware—</L>

<P>Speak for yourself, Frank, heigho!— I am neither ruined nor undone.</P>

<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a paragraph confirms all
<STAGE>(<HI>reads</HI>)</STAGE>
"We hear that a great house not one hundred miles from Leadenhall-street, stopped payment yesterday for a considerable sum."—It must be our house!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it must be our house;—but pray, Frank, who is this <HI>we,</HI> who pretends to know so much about master's affairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is <HI>we?</HI>—Why in truth, Lucy, I don't rightly know who <HI>we</HI> is; but <HI>we</HI> is somebody
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
who knows, or pretends to know, every body, and every thing—<HI>we</HI> used to abuse opposition—<HI>we</HI> now are come over with ministry—<HI>we</HI> writes against men on one side, and <HI>we</HI> writes against measures on the other—<HI>we</HI> attacks majority in one paper, and <HI>we</HI> cuts up minority in another—<HI>we</HI> puffs admirals and demireps—<HI>we</HI> ridicules generals and women of character—<HI>we</HI> is an critic who tears authors to pieces—it is <HI>we</HI> who strives to write players out of their bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then is <HI>we</HI> an ill-natured, crabbed, un∣conscionable fellow—I love play actors in my heart—they say so many good things I can't think they do any thing bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I live here comes Mr. Trueman—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your hand, honest Frank—the West-India fleet's arrived!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the homeward-bound East-Indiamen are all safe in port.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravissimo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Mr. Fairport has traced the report of our house's failure up to old Rebate, the money∣lender.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>What motive could have urged his malice to such premeditated villainy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>The worst of motives, madam, resentment and avarice—your uncle rescued a distressed young gentleman from his usurious demands, and is indebted to him eleven thousand pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ame.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what brings him here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your uncle being denied to him in town, he left a memorandum that he should come here
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>
to seek him; and I am commissioned to give the rascal an answer to one of the most impudent proposals that ever insolence dictated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ame.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what is it, Mr. Trueman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! dear sir, what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>No less than a written proposal of mar∣riage, between his son and your cousin Augusta</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(to Amelia.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Mercy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accompanied with a threat to lay on an execution immediately, in case of a refusal; and a discharge in full of all demands, as a bribe, in case of compliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know Praecipe his son well, sir—he's as precious a twig of the law as ever switched a client through Westminster hall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ame.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old man knows, I suppose, that my cousin's fortune is independent of her father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for Heaven's sake, sir, how did my young lady receive the proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Laughed at it—she is a generous-hearted girl, and offered the whole of her fortune to sup∣port her father's credit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ame.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is city sentiment—the uncourtly citizens, not only speak as they think, but act as they speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I wish, madam, every other class of men, would make their public actions the criterion of their public professions.—Take care Lucy, old Rebate's a terrible fellow, tormented with as insa∣tiable an appetite for young girls as for money —the monster would devour a virgin every morn∣ing for breakfast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember when he was partner in a re∣gister-office, for the purpose of ruining young creatures out of place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>And though he'd impose upon his nearest friend to obtain money, he'd lavish the earnings of his avarice with prodigality to destroy inno∣cence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ame.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shan't we be reveng'd on him?— Suppose I was to throw myself in his way, and se∣duce him into an intrigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tru.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do, I'll take a part in the farce, and we'll retaliate on him with a vengeance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And leave the young lawyer to me—ne∣ver fear, I'll bring him to the stool of repen∣tance
<STAGE>(knocking without.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps here they come.</P>

<P>Then, I'll let them in, and give the anti∣quated Adonis a most encouraging reception— Come, Mr. Trueman.

<P>I attend you, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strike him at once, madam, with a lan∣guishing look.
<STAGE>(Exeunt Amelia and Trueman)</STAGE>
La, Frank, there's a scheme in my head—but I'm ashamed to tell you—Well, I'll hide my face
<STAGE>(throws her apron over her face)</STAGE>
Suppose you were to introduce me to the young attorney as my lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>An excellent thought, my sprightly girl! —run and communicate it to Mr. Trueman and Miss Amelia—But I must have a kiss.

<STAGE>(Exit. Lucy, Rebate viewing her through a glass)</STAGE>
Neat limbed—slender waisted—elastic in her feet, with a noble protuberance in front, and a most entic∣ing rotunda in the rear; no cork or whalebone in her composition, I warrant.—Your servant, young

man, your servant—Pray who is the elegant young lady who gave me admittance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose it was Miss Amelia, sir, my master's niece—I thought you knew her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I'm unacquainted with the females of your family. She is really a charming girl, with a pair of as piercing, sparkling rogueish eyes, as ever sported in amorous glance—A good fortune, I sup∣pose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a shilling, sir; Miss Amelia is de∣pendent on my master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Reb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor girl—a delicious morsel! but must now seek for a new protector.—Your mas∣ter's broke, young man—Have you seen the pub∣lic prints?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>The public prints, sir—there's no believ∣ing the public prints! It was but the other day the General Advertiser made the combined fleets sixty-six sail of the line—the Courant encreased them to eighty sail—the Post anchored them <HI>in Nu∣bibus</HI>—the Herald wind-bound them in Brest har∣bour—the Gazetteer lost them in a fog—the Pub∣lic Advertiser brought them into Plymouth Sound —the Chronicle sent them to the Land's-end, and the Ledger assured us they were not ships, but sixty whales, which had made the coast, and that the express had been brought up to London-Bridge by Lieutenant Grampus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! ha! ha! ha! You're a wag—but there's no joke in the loss of the East and West-India ships—You're master's ruined by it, and I have his bond for eleven thousand.</P>

<P>Actionable words—let me see—to call a lawyer ambodexter, or double handed, is—</P>

<P>Mr. Trueman, my business is with your master, not with his clerk; and in his present in∣digent circumstances, it was his duty to have at∣tended me—but I'll follow you.
<STAGE>(Exit servant.)</STAGE>
You live in splendor here, young man,

<P>In a funny stile, as a body may say— Poll lodges at Islington, so I travel down to her every Saturday afternoon—take tea with Poll, spend my evening at the Angel—Next morning rise from Poll, swallow rum and milk at the Angel—breakfast with Poll, take my whet and jill at the Angel—Dine with Poll, spend my after∣noon at the Angel—Take tea with Poll, spend my evening at the Angel—Sup with Poll, take my Punch at the Angel—So on Monday morning, leave Poll betimes, take the stage at the Angel, and am at chambers by eight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, between Miss Poll and the Angel, you lead a devilish angelic life—But I fear, Mr. Praecipe, there is a fatal objection to your marrying Miss Fairport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean my connection with Poll; but I can soon get rid of her, and provide for her into the bargain—Mark a writ against her, move her by <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> into the King's Bench, and there, though wives are not permitted to live with their husbands, a demirep may make a fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake my young lady's objection —she has vowed never to marry a lawyer.</P>

<P>True indeed—But if you're not afraid of a frolic, I'll put you in a way of carrying her.</P>

<P>Afraid! Never fear me, I love a frolic in my heart; nevertheless, and always providing, that the said frolic is not contrary to law—<HI>Caveat actor,</HI> do you understand me, is my maxim.</P>

<P>Then your father must not know a word of the business.</P>

and possession, as the saying is, is the eleventh point of the law—The devil a shilling shall my honest father ever touch of these bills—And the devil a shilling shall his honest correspondent. Tribulation, ever touch of the produce of these diamonds.
<STAGE>(looks at them)</STAGE>
He, he, he, egad, there's more argument in the brilli∣ancy of their sparkle, than in the tongues of the whole bar, and they shall be my counsel with Miss Fairport—This letter will keep my father si∣lent—high treason to correspond with the enemy— but this is losing time, and I long to be up to the elbows in the venison-pasty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, this young lady, this Miss Amelia, Mr Fairport's niece, is entirely depen∣dant on his bounty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, poor lady; her father, on his re∣turn from India, died at Amsterdam; he had con∣verted his effects into diamonds, but it could never be discovered what became of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir—But there is a strong suspi∣cion that they were stolen by a Quaker, at whose house he lodged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye—These diamonds must be the very same of which Primitive Tribulation has advised me

<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if not, you are ready to seize upon his effects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready to secure my property, young man—will he accede to my proposal, he can have no doubt upon my sufficiency, he knows me to be a <HI>good</HI> man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good man, Sir—Yes, you are a good man, Sir, and I wish many whom I know to be good men, in money transactions, were good men in the discharge of every other moral obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't comprehend you, young man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll be explicit, old gentleman— What good does your boasted goodness arise from —Is it from transacting business with the necessi∣tous,
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
upon such terms of hardship, as cramp every effort of industry? Is it from advancing money on the jointures of distressed widows—the com∣missions of reduced officers—and the livings of poor clergymen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Eh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you consider yourself a good man, because you can make good bargains? or is it be∣cause you can laugh with good humour at every man's distress? I have known the enormous wealth of such good men, who while living never did a generous action, bequeathed at the hour of death to build an hospital, wherein the poor have languished for want of common necessaries, while the stewards and domestics have feasted and fat∣tened upon the revenues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you forget I have your master's bond for eleven thousand, and could overwhelm him with ruin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Sir, Mr. Fairport rejects your proposal with contempt—What would the world say, should a British merchant act with such dishonor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dishonor! Why, man, there is no such thing as dishonor in a transaction of traffic; this is the golden age, in which every thing is bought and sold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>But conscience, Mr. Rebate—consci∣ence the estimate of justice—she is a judge whose admonitions are not to be silenced, and rectitude alone can save us from the poignancy of her stings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conscience may be a judge for aught I know; but eleven thousand pounds would effectu∣ally silence her accusations—many a judge has held his tongue for half the money—But I shall
<PB N="23" REF="20"/>
wait to see your master, young man, so will take a turn in the garden, and, no doubt, will find the elegance of his improvements equal to the mag∣nificence of his mansion.</P>

What an impudent moralizing rascal—this fellow is not one of your cloven-tongued gentry, with one tongue for his public, and another tongue for his private principles—he should have been bred to the church—But how am I to act? interest and passion possess me—This Amelia mo∣nopolizes my mind—Let me consider; her father died at Amsterdam in the house of a Quaker—aye, it's plain my correspondent, Tribulation, was the plunderer of his diamonds, and these diamonds he was to consign to me for sale—the uncle's ruined, and could I persuade the niece to come under my protection, this would turn out an Argonaut ex∣pedition, and I should have the sheering of a golden fleece—Let me see—

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to be sure, Sir, as she is foolish and maddish, if she was to marry an old gentleman, now suppose such a healthy old gentleman as you, Sir, he might lock her up, you know, to preserve her from young gallants.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad you're a wit, my girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who I? No, indeed, your honor—I am but young, foolish, and flighty myself; yet I think if a husband was to lock me up, to preserve my virtue, I'd be tempted to turn so troublesome a companion out of my company.—But as I was going to say, I do think Miss Amelia has as deli∣cate a shape as any lady in England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she has, so she has, you baggage, and as inticing a look.—Could you now contrive to introduce me to this foolish, half-mad Amelia? Eh.—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>La, Sir, if I was found out in such a business, it would for ever ruin my reputation.</P>

<P>But it would get you money, hussey— and those who have money are above reputation, or what would become of parties in <HI>crim. con.?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, your honor, my conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Conscience! Why conscience, child, is expelled from both ends of the town, or we should not get an enemy's ship insured for love or money; the whole system of stock-jobbing would be over∣turned; the lottery offices might put out their lamps, and the deluded people would no longer be led to destruction by authorized jack-a-lanterns.</P>

<P>Honesty! Honesty, my lamb, is a ma∣terial drawback on pleasure and profit. Those who never deviate from the paths of honesty, move like snails through the world; they leave a shining track behind, but make a very slow progress in the road to preferment.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, step into the parlour on the left side of the hall, I'll attend you immediately, and will render you every service in my power

<P>Lord! Lord! Ma'am, can you look in his face and say so? are not his eyes twinkling out this very instant, will you marry me, will you mar∣ry me? Take her hand, Mr. Trueman; she told me this very day you had her heart.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>The old gentleman has swallowed every thing I've told him, and believes you, Ma'am, to be a half witted kind of a flighty hair-brained gen∣tlewoman—his passion has made a fool of him, and as this is a trial of skill between Frank and me, I'll try if I can't get him to take up a new charac∣ter, as well as his son.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, it is true; she loves the army above all things, and will sometimes speak for an hour together, particularly in the full of the moon, Sir, about battles, and soldiers, and cutting of throats.

You are equally deserving; for I know of none who merit severer punishment than those who assume his majesty's livery, and put on the insignia of a soldier, without possessing that dignity, honor and courage, which are essential to a military cha∣racter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And heaven knows, Sir, there are plenty of such uncommissioned coxcombs about town. But pray rise, your honor,
<STAGE>(<HI>to Rebate</HI>)</STAGE>
this is ho∣nest Mr. Rebate, equipt in your 'sociation uni∣form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Caught with the <HI>maner</HI>—that is to say, with the property upon you
<STAGE>(<HI>to his father.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>But see, I have done my business without your assistance. I have married Miss Fairport
<STAGE>(<HI>puts his hand under Lucy's arm</HI>)</STAGE>
here she stands; her for∣tune's mine, I am her <HI>baron,</HI> she's my <HI>feme,</HI> and under my coverture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, Sir, I am your daughter, but not Miss Fairport; and as to fortune, mine lies in a deal-box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>So—I have stultified myself in open court—But father I'm not an old fool—and we have money enough, and diamonds too—and give me your hand, bone of my bone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(to Praecipe)</STAGE>
<P>In marriage you know a captain's an attorney, and an attorney's a captain— So by the same rule a gentlewoman's a waiting maid, and a waiting maid a gentlewoman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>A clear case, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> with a <HI>quo ad hoc.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mr. Trueman, read this letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which I received from my spouse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is evidence of the blackest crime can be committed by a subject against his king and country—giving succour to their enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>High-treason! as I always told you father when you quoted the Dutch as a precedent for having, when at war, sold powder and ball to the enemy to pepper their own carcases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Rebate—This letter is directed to you, Sir, and from its contents, I have reason to conclude, that the diamonds you have received from Amsterdam, are the property of this lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Diamonds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Sir, diamonds—This letter is cer∣tainly written by the Quaker, at whose house my father lodged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Looking at the letter)</STAGE>
<P>O! I shall run mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here are the diamonds, Madam
<STAGE>(deliver∣ing the case)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you, idiot, give a receipt for those monies and diamonds in my name?
<STAGE>(to Prae∣cipe)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am an Englishman, and not bound to answer personal interrogatories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll hang you for the forgery, you dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>I defy your indictment—I acted as your lawful attorney; or if I had not, a Quaker is your only witness; and your Quakers are so conscientious, they would let the worst of rogues escape, sooner than take an oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you rascal—Peter the Great was right, when having but two lawyers in his domi∣nions, he hung one as an example to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="44"/>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may abuse the law, father; but we should not have imposing lawyers, if there were not litigious clients.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>Standing on his left hand.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>Remember your advice to me,
<Q>be ashamed of nothing, Lucy, but being poor—the rich are above shame.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amelia.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>Standing on his right hand.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>And re∣member, that the credit of a merchant, like the virtue of a woman, or the courage of a soldier, is his point of honor; and that as no recompense can satisfy the loss of credit, no punishment is too se∣vere for the villain who dares to traduce it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rebate.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll stay no longer—I'll convert all my effects into cash, and fly to Holland, where every man who has money may be sure of protection.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Praecipe.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wait for your cloaths, father—my wife shall recover your suit—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>What we have experienced will, I hope, teach us this moral—that while virtue guides our passions, happiness is the certain consequence, and that misery is ever the result of submitting to vicious habits. May every Briton bring these pre∣cepts into practice—and may every Briton also re∣member, that as the credit, the wealth, the strength, the dignity of the British empire flow from com∣merce, to support and extend commerce is the in∣dispensible duty of every British subject.
