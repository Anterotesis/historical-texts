<P>YOU are to consider this Dedication as a grateful return to the warmth of your friendship, a just tribute to the integrity of your heart.—Seven years intimacy have con∣vinced me of both—</P>
<P>Exclusive of these motives, I have another—</P>
<P>The author of Sir CALLAGHAN O'BRAL∣LAGHAN, merits respect from every Irishman. —That character has been of national ser∣vice, by being a means of removing, in a great measure, illiberal prejudices which had too long promoted enmity between sister-king∣doms, but are now happily diminished.</P>

<P>THIS <HI>Bagatelle</HI> appeared originally in the PUBLIC LEDGER, in detached pieces, most of which were copied from that paper into the MORNING HERALD.—And they having received the approbation of the Public, the writer was induced to collect them into a volume; and as he will pursue the subject in the <HI>Ledger,</HI> should this volume have success, he will shortly publish another.</P>

<HEAD>SENTIMENTAL EXCURSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>I Read and read, but could not retain a word of what I read.—So many friends flowed in upon me daily to breakfast, and so many friends to carry me out to dine, that to understand the doctrine of <HI>descents,</HI> the point I was studying, was impossible. I must cut off, said I, the <HI>entail</HI> of these engagements, and become master of my own time.</P>
<P>Returning from the <HI>Grecian</HI> at one in the morning, I ordered my servants to pack up my cloaths, with a few books; and at six, he, with my portmanteau on his shoulders, and I, with <HI>Lord Coke</HI> under one arm, (with whom I in∣tended to comment upon <HI>old</HI> law) and Sir James Burrow (from whom I expected in∣struction

in <HI>new</HI> law) under the other <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">I do not understand what our journalist here means by his distinction between <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new</HI> law; the efficient principles of law are <HI>immutable,</HI> the <HI>co∣incidents</HI> are the same; therefore modern deter∣minations should <HI>coincide</HI> with ancient adjudications; otherwise, notwithstanding the <HI>co-existence</HI> of legal principles which I have proved, <HI>somewhere,</HI> to be at least <HI>coequal</HI> with nature itself, judgments upon the same principles would be deficient in <HI>co-operation.</HI> Lord Coke's Reports are called the <HI>gospel</HI> of the law. —Sir James Burrow's Reports may be stiled the <HI>Apocalypse</HI> of the law, and as for my reports, I am determined to have them called the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> Of the law.—<BIBL>C.

<P>The coach was empty, so ordering my man to mount the outside, and going inside my∣self, after musing a few minutes on the great progress I should make in the <HI>art</HI> and science of jurisprudence, during the vacation, be∣tween <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Trinity term,</HI> I folded my arms within each other, having first wrapped myself in a large cloak, threw myself along the seat, and wishing farewel to London, to all the pleasures of London and to all its temp∣tations, fell into a profound slumber.</P>

<HEAD>THE HIGHWAYMAN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was in the merry month of May, when the whole animal creation, from the minutest insect the microscope discovers upon the leaf, to the largest beast which grazes in the field, or preys in the forest; when the fowls of the air, from the diminutive hum∣ming bird to the eagle of the sun; when the fishes of the sea, from the little sprat to the un∣wieldy leviathan, pay implicit obedience to that divine ordinance of heaven, <HI>increase and multi∣ply.</HI> I say, it was in the month of May, so justly stiled "the mother of love," when na∣ture wears an universal smile, when every plant and tree sprouts forth in bud and blossom, and the whole earth is cloathed in variegated green: being fast asleep in a stage-coach on the road to Windsor, and my imagination having taken an excursion in a dream to visit,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
to converse with, and to embrace, some dear friends in Ireland, I was disturbed from my sweet vision about five miles from London, by a tremendous voice, from the side of the road, which with reiterated vociferation, roar∣ed out, Stop! stop!</P>
<P>My hands instinctively slipped into my breeches pocket, and with a motion equally involuntary, drew forth a small purse, con∣taining the small sum of one guinea and a few shillings, to give the highwayman. The coachman at the same instant drew up his horses.</P>
<P>If any hero wishes to be informed why I did not rather apply to my pistols—I had none with me, or if I had, I should not have applied to them.</P>
<P>Indeed, instead of charging my pistols, which I left hanging up in my chambers, where may they long hang for ornaments, I had prepared the small sum I have before men∣tioned, and put it into the little purse afore∣said, in case of being stopped; for it has long been my opinion, that if a man considers his
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
own interest, in which undoubtedly his <HI>peace of mind</HI> has an intimate and large share—to part with what he can spare from his absolute necessities, will appear preferable to risquing rise for a trifle. It requires no great portion of humanity to conclude, that to deprive a fellow-creature of life, and dispatch his soul in the very act of sin, to
<Q>that country from whose bourne no traveller re∣turns,</Q>
though compatible with earthly <HI>justice,</HI> must be offensive to eternal <HI>mercy.</HI> If this assertion be erroneous, how comes it that the act of sacrificing a wretch's life in de∣fence of a paltry sum, always impresses upon the mind of the avenger, a horror which amounts to punishment?</P>
<P>As the coach-door opened I put out my hand—here, my honest friend, said I, ad∣dressing myself to the highwayman, here, take my money.</P>
<P>I received a shot in return for my cour∣tesy—</P>
<P>I say a shot—but not a shot from a pistol, nor a shot from a blunderbuss—it was a chain-shot,
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
or a double-headed shot, which you please, discharged from a pair of as bright eyes as ever wounded the heart of an unwary traveller.</P>
<P>The lady mistaking the offer of my hand, which intended to convey my purse to the supposed highwayman, for an offer to assist her into the carriage, seized it with the most good humoured familiarity, and fixing her right foot firm upon the coach-step, raised her body up with a spring of agility, which clear∣ly proved, elasticity was not the least property in her composition.</P>
<P>Thus she stood in equilibrium, nodding and smiling a farewel over her left shoulder, to a male friend, the person who had ordered the coach to stop: and taking her seat exactly opposite to me, she waved her hand out of the coach window, to her parting companion —the coachman, with a <HI>hoi, hoi,</HI> and a crack of his whip, informed his horses of their duty, the horses obeyed, and we drove on.</P>

<HEAD>THE POCKET HOOP.</HEAD>
<P>IT is astonishing, that women will encum∣ber their persons so as to alter the elegant symmetry of the human frame!—The person of a fine woman is the most beautiful edifice in nature!—True beauty consists in simplicity, and the figure of a well-made female always shews to the best advantage when its orna∣ments are simple—it should never be embel∣lished in the <HI>composite</HI> order.—From the days of <HI>fig-leaves,</HI> to the present time, <HI>art</HI> has only laboured to disguise nature.—</P>
<P>History informs us, that Queen Elizabeth was remarkable for the protuberance of <HI>the rotunda</HI>; and this, say the antiquarians in dress, first introduced the fashion of hoops. But whether this <HI>rotunda</HI> was a <HI>permanent rotunda behind,</HI> natural to the make of her Majesty, or a <HI>temporary</HI> rotunda <HI>before,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
arising from a <HI>natural cause,</HI> authors are silent <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>Hoops are of much greater antiquity than our author seems to have a knowledge of.—They were worn by the Greeks and Romans. Queen Elizabeth's hoop was called a <HI>farthingal,</HI> it gave rise to <HI>scandal,</HI> but to keep her Majesty in countenance, the whole court assumed <HI>big bellies,</HI> which soon became the gene∣ral pink of the mode. This courtly condescension to the Virgin Queen, has nothing particular in it.— When Queen Anne had a lame leg, the women of fashion carried crutch-sticks; and not many years past, the late French King being forced to cut off the fore-top of his hair, on account of a <HI>scald-head,</HI> not only the nobility and gentry of France, but the nobility and gentry of Great-Britain and Ire∣land, cropped their upper locks close to the scull. When Henry VIII. in 1521, cut his hair short, all England followed his example. <HI>Camer. Oper. Sub∣cisio Cent.</HI> 358.—C. C—TT—R—L.</P>
<P>The divine writer, Isaiah, describes the Jewish la∣dies of his time, in an attire so exactly similar to that which distinguishes the modern English ladies of the <HI>ton,</HI> that one would imagine he was prophesying of their dress. He mentions their stomachers and their towering heads, their curls, their flowing garments, and their crisping-pins. Solomon too, who having the experience of five hundred wives, and fifteen hundred concubines, and of course must have been well acquainted with the influence of the female over the male sex, in his admonitions to youth, cautions them to beware of the rustling of silks, and the creek∣ing of heels, for it leads to—it led Solomon, the wisest of mankind, from the worship of the Almighty God to the sacrifice of idols.—<BIBL>MADAN, D. D.</BIBL></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="12"/>A hoop, says an old writer, is an airy cool dress.—That may be, answers a modern wri∣ter, arguing upon the same subject—but how comes it to pass that Queen Elizabeth, who was a <HI>virgin</HI> Queen, and her <HI>maids</HI> of <HI>honour,</HI> who were <HI>virgins</HI> by <HI>virtue</HI> of their office, should require more cooling than their grand∣mothers? Now the question is very easily an∣swered—Queen Elizabeth and her <HI>maids</HI> of honour were <HI>virgins</HI>—their grandmothers cer∣tainly were not.</P>
<P>I suppose, Sir, said my fellow-traveller, we shall breakfast here, as the coach stopped at the <HI>Star and Garter</HI> at Kew-bridge.—I leap∣ed out, and gave the lady my hand:—she sprung forward, but the treacherous hoop crossing the door of the coach, gave so sud∣den a jerk to the lady, that as she sprung she fell, and as she fell, of course the hoop became inversed, as you may have seen an umbrella, or <HI>parasol,</HI> on a windy day—she slipped from under her garments.—Heaven preserve us!</P>
<P>I fixed my eyes upon the <HI>sign.</HI>—It is the <HI>Star and Garter,</HI> said I to myself, in an un∣der
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
voice, and in the same tone I read the motto—</P>
<Q>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.</Q>
<P>I kept my eyes fixed upon the <HI>sign,</HI> without once attempting to extricate the lady. Had it been the sign of the <HI>Gorgon</HI>'s head, I could not have been more <HI>petrified</HI>;—but my man, who had now descended from the roof of the coach, having more presence of mind, en∣tered the coach at the opposite door, and tak∣ing the lady by the shoulders, gently pulled her backwards, while I smoothed her cloaths, and brought the villainous hoop to its primi∣tive situation.</P>
<P>The lady, having adjusted her drapery, came out sideways—</P>
<P>I led her into the house, and being shewn into a room—she cursed her hoop in a tone of bitterness infinitely more vindictive than the curse itself—but how could I say <HI>Amen?</HI>— I considered myself under some obligations to
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
the object of her curses, "so <HI>amen</HI> stuck in my throat <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>—Seraglios—Spanish protections. I tell you they are nothing to the English hoop. Confinement stimulates a woman to do that which otherwise would never enter her head—and pray Sir, did you ever hear that a <HI>padlock</HI> could protect a <HI>leathern</HI> portmanteau from the plundering hand of a robber? I tell you no woman has her chastity so well forti∣fied, as an English woman of the present day. Who the devil can approach her? In the rear she carries <HI>bastions</HI> of cork—in front she has <HI>crown-works</HI> of whalebone—on the right and left <HI>flanks</HI> and <HI>gorgeats,</HI> nothing is wanting to compleat the strength of the place but a <HI>tenaille</HI> in the <HI>ditch.</HI>—But if the fashion continues, Sir, we shall never be able to carry a point by <HI>storm.</HI>—True, and therein lies the safety of fe∣male chastity, for all approaches must now be car∣ried on by <HI>sap,</HI> whenever a lady commits <HI>faux pas</HI> in the day-time—do you mind, in the day-time— she must never more blame her stars, or attempt to excuse the transgression by the suddenness of the attack, as so many preparatory <HI>manoeuvres</HI> are ne∣cessary to the <HI>dismantling</HI> of the place.</P>
<P>Now, the daughter of the old General who was making these wise remarks upon the utility of hoops, was preparing for bed in an adjacent room, and by clapping a hand to each hip, and drawing a slip-knot, overturned every thing her father said—for down came the <HI>fortification,</HI> with the <HI>bastions</HI> and the <HI>crown-works</HI> flap upon the floor. I wish, said the young lady, slipping under the bed-cloaths, my fa∣ther's wish would succeed.—I wish it was the fashion for every woman to have a <HI>tenaille</HI> in the ditch.— <BIBL>TOBY.</BIBL></P></NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>It was all my own fault, said the lady;— I should have come out sideways at first.—But the way you attempted to come, Madam, said I, was the most <HI>natural.</HI>—True, she replied but not the most <HI>fortunate</HI>; our <HI>natural</HI> move∣ments seldom are, said I—till this instant I considered <HI>hoops</HI> as protections from such ac∣cidents, replied the lady, but I now perceive they render one's <HI>motions</HI> very <HI>unnatural</HI>—so saying, she retired. Breakfast was served in: —the lady returned, divested of her hoop— her dimity jacket fitted her shape exactly— her petticoat hung in folds—an elegant <HI>negle∣gee</HI> appearance marked her person—the con∣scious tint upon her cheek indexed the con∣tinuance of her confusion.—We breakfasted, and having ascended the carriage with cau∣tion, and taken our seats, without further accident, pursued our journey.</P>
<P>Though the air in the month of May is more congenial to the blood, and more in∣vigorating to the constitution of all animals, than the air of any other month in the year;
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
yet man, or woman, after long residence in the metropolis, the pores being open, and the mus∣cles being relaxed, by the heat of full theatres, balls, routs, masquerades, ridottos, close rooms, and sea-coal fires, will find the morn∣ing breeze of the country too sharp for their unbraced nerves and debilitated joints.</P>
<P>This was my case—I perceived my fair companion also shrunk from the acuteness of the biting air, and sought comfortable warmth in closely wrapping round her a pale pink sat∣tin cloak, lined with sable fur.</P>
<P>I don't know a more pleasing <HI>contrast</HI> than <HI>pink</HI> faced with <HI>black</HI>—and the lining of the lady's cloak formed such a contrast, the <HI>black fur</HI> with which it was lined, turning over the edge of the <HI>pink sattin</HI> like a <HI>facing</HI> or la∣pel <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Scarlet, faced with black, has been the uni∣form of the bravest troops; it was worn by <HI>Ligonier</HI>'s horse, who fought with such amazing courage at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and is now worn by— <HI>the London Military Association.</HI>—<BIBL>ANONYMOUS.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="17"/>Perceiving, then, that the lady not only in∣dicated an aguish tremor, but that sleep had shed his drowsy influence upon her lids, which repeatedly dropped their "fringed curtains" over her eyes;—I proposed drawing up the coach-blinds — the lady complied.—</P>
<P>We both benefited by the precaution.—</P>
<P>The lady soon involuntarily resigned herself to the soft folding arms of sleep, who fixed his leaden seal upon her eyes.—I exercised my mind in meditation.</P>
<P>It has been said, that sleep is the emblem of death. The object I looked upon, so far from raising this gloomy idea in me, produced a quite contrary effect.—I thought of nothing but <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>prolongation of life</HI>—my thoughts arose from my <HI>feelings,</HI> my feelings from what I saw—but my feelings were not merely <HI>lo∣cal</HI>—life trembled through the current of my blood—dilated my heart — inspired my soul— expanded my thoughts—warmed my imagi∣nation to extasy—and, I answer for it, spoke at my eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="18"/>How easy would it have been at that in∣stant to have <HI>tickled</HI> me to death—I should have shrunk from the touch like a sensitive plant.—</P>
<P>The lady slept on—</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>A MEDITATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE scene at the inn-door, when I inno∣cently gazed up on the <HI>Star and Garter,</HI> was fresh in my memory. Not an astronomer of them all, from Ptolemy the Egyptian, down to Copernicus the German, and from Co∣pernicus the German, down to Newton the Englishman, had ever so strong a conception of the <HI>hirsute</HI> constellation, called by <HI>star-gaz∣ers Berenice</HI>'s <HI>locks,</HI> as I had of the <HI>sign</HI> at Kew-bridge.—Every object was painted upon my imagination in the most lively colours.</P>
<P>I recollected the lady's confusion on the un∣fortunate event of her <HI>pocket-hoop</HI>—and this recollection produced in my mind an investi∣gation of <HI>modesty.</HI>—When an Indian was ask∣ed how he could go naked, and expose his body to the cold air, he answered,
<Q>because I am all <HI>face.</HI></Q>
Now the same answer would
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
have been as pertinent had it related to <HI>mo∣desty,</HI> instead of <HI>feeling</HI>; for in those coun∣tries, where the inhabitants go perfectly na∣ked, they look upon each other as undisturb∣ed, with as chaste an eye, and unflushed coun∣tenance, as if they were <HI>all face.</HI> With them every part is equally indifferent as to sight: the less <HI>modesty</HI> the less <HI>feeling</HI>;—the less <HI>feel∣ing,</HI> the less <HI>incontinence,</HI> in thought, in word, and in deed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> were remarkable for <HI>vir∣tue,</HI> yet possessed very little <HI>modesty</HI>; and when we compare their customs with the customs of the chearful, happy inhabitants of the <HI>south∣ern isles,</HI> discovered by Captain Cooke, it ap∣pears the Lacedaemonians were perfect <HI>masters,</HI> and <HI>mistresses</HI> too, of the celebrated <HI>Timiradi dance,</HI> practised by the people of both sexes in <HI>Otaheite</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>Plato, after the example of several well insti∣tuted republicks, ordained, that the men and women of all ages should divest themselves of their cloath∣ing, and appear perfectly naked; you will see the reason of it in his <HI>Gymnastick.</HI> The women of <HI>Pegu</HI> wear no covering below the waist, but a cloath slit up before.—The Lacedaemonian women saw daily the Spartan youth perform their exercises naked, and wore such slight garments themselves, that as they walked discovered their thighs, they being, as Plato says, sufficiently covered with their virtue.— MONTAIGNE.</P>
<P>This might perhaps cool the sense of <HI>seeing</HI>—but how did it affect <HI>feeling.—Seeing's</HI> believing, but <HI>feeling</HI> has no <HI>fellow.</HI>—<BIBL>RAY'S PROVERB.</BIBL></P></NOTE>. It must be left to the judgment
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
of the ladies, whether the daughter of <HI>Cato</HI> was right in her opinion, that women should <HI>take off</HI> and <HI>reassume</HI> their <HI>modesty</HI> with their <HI>garments.</HI> It is certain the Roman matron was a <HI>patriot,</HI> not however of that class of <HI>pa∣triots</HI> who ornament the <HI>present times</HI>; she was not influenced by <HI>self</HI>—but from a regard to <HI>posterity.</HI>—And where is the woman who has not a regard to <HI>posterity?</HI> I answer—the wo∣man who is not solely attached to <HI>one</HI> man, has neither regard for <HI>posterity</HI> nor for <HI>herself,</HI> and cannot be a patriot.</P>
<P>Thus did I mentally philosophize, till after long meditation, I concluded with a modern voyager <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Forster, who attended Captain Cooke on his second voyage.</NOTE>, who from the contemplation of unpolished people, has drawn this opinion,
<Q><PB N="19" REF="22"/>that <HI>modesty</HI> and <HI>chastity,</HI> which have long been supposed to be inherent in the human mind, are local ideas, unknown in the state of nature, and modified according to the various degrees of civilization.</Q></P>
<P>Yet when <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had eaten of the <HI>forbidden fruit,</HI> plucked from the <HI>tree of know∣ledge,</HI> they saw they were naked, and were ashamed.</P>
<P>Oh chastity! thou art a great and shining virtue in civilized states! Thy utility is suf∣ficiently known—but to govern and prevail with thee according to <HI>nature,</HI> is as difficult as it is easy to do it according to <HI>custom.</HI> Thou hast nothing, let me tell thee, pure and fair maid, to support thy precepts, but the hoary head, and shrivelled face, of ancient <HI>use.</HI></P>
<P>And what is to be deduced from this? Why that the fair fabrick of <HI>chastity,</HI> was erected upon the <HI>ruins</HI> of the <HI>bowers of paradise.</HI> But is not <HI>chastity</HI> in women the same as <HI>courage</HI> is in men? Is not <HI>chastity</HI> the very <HI>centre</HI> of a <HI>woman's</HI> point of honour? Is not female chastity a <HI>castle</HI> defended by religion, mora∣lity,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
reason, custom, pride, apprehension, and shame? True, but when <HI>nature</HI> mutinies <HI>within,</HI> and love attacks the <HI>out-works,</HI> this well-defended <HI>castle,</HI> is no more than—<HI>a castle in the air.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE EXAMINATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE lady slept on.—</P>
<P>I could not get a wink of sleep.—</P>
<P>The devil take that <HI>sign,</HI> said I to myself, cursing the <HI>Star and Garter</HI> at Kew-bridge. Yet why should I curse the <HI>Star and Garter!</HI> Is it not an <HI>insignia,</HI> which our most gracious sovereign respects—which the first of our no∣bility are continually in pursuit of.—And has not the learned Pettingall, who was a master of arts, thus delivered his opinion, after quot∣ing some hundred authorities, in all languages, that the <HI>Star and Garter</HI> are <HI>amulets</HI> or <HI>charms,</HI> allegorical symbols of <HI>unity</HI>; or as Camden and Heylin have it,
<Q>a bond of the most <HI>in∣ward society,</HI> and a <HI>badge</HI> of <HI>unity</HI> and <HI>con∣cord,</HI> to inspire <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>vigour</HI> in men;</Q>
—and does he not say, what every <HI>true man</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
will join with him in saying, <HI>honi soit qui mal y pense,</HI> should be rendered,
<Q>shame and con∣fusion to him that designs any evil against the wearer, (that is the wearer of the <HI>Star and Garter</HI>) may all his designs be retorted on the author.</Q>
But why are the Bench of Bishops excluded from wearing this <HI>amu∣let?</HI> Because they have <HI>mitres</HI> annexed to their <HI>Bishopricks,</HI> and that amounts to the same <HI>thing</HI> —and as to the lawyers, why, they have their <HI>black</HI> patches upon their <HI>wigs</HI>—and their <HI>scar∣let</HI> patches upon their <HI>doctors</HI> gowns—and their <HI>furs</HI> for their judges robes, delectable to the <HI>touch.</HI></P>
<P>To banish the idea of the <HI>sign</HI> at <HI>Kew-bridge,</HI> I examined the lady's face.—Her eyes were shut—here could I ramble through half a dozen pages, expatiating on the beauty of the <HI>eye</HI>—whether black, hazel, grey, or blue —whether open or closed, whether shaded by a full grown <HI>dark brow,</HI> or arched over with the smoothness of a <HI>mouse-skin.</HI>—I never gave a determined preference to any particular co∣lour, only let it not be a jaundiced eye—nor
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
a basilisk's eye—I hate both—but I have long thought, that the eye of a woman looks best when on the <HI>twinkle</HI>; that is, when it is nei∣ther open, nor shut, but like the setting sun skirted by a shading cloud, emanates a lam∣bient fire, through the medium of bordering fringe, with which nature has wisely provided it, for the purposes of ornament and pro∣tection.—</P>
<P>Give me an eye with quivering beams, dancing with irregularity like the reflection of the moon upon agitated water <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Mr. DE LOUTHERBOURG is under the necessity of acquainting the public, as a duty he owes them, as well as himself, that he has not given his assent to the insertion of the above idea, which is undoubtedly stolen from the moonlight scene in his EIDOPHUSI∣KON, and is therefore an imposition on the public, and an invasion of his property.—<HI>Lisle-street, Lei∣cester-square, April</HI> 26, 1781.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>I was eighteen years of age, when I first dis∣covered, that the perfection of beauty in the eye, or rather the perfect force of the opera∣tions of the eye upon the <HI>heart,</HI> is not to be found, either when the eye is open, or when
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
the eye is shut, but when the eye is upon the <HI>twinkle.</HI>—The impression I then received was deep, and I shall die in the opinion which was the result of it.</P>

<P>THE lady slept on—smiled as she slept, and as she smiled <HI>she</HI> sighed—</P>
<P>Health sported upon her cheek, while love, with a most inticing grace, diffused a non-re∣sisting, if not inviting complacency over every feature, and wantoned on her neck.—Her lips smooth, and red as coral, pouted with ful∣ness, and with a glowing ripeness equal to the blush of the wild strawberry, smooth as the sattin'd softness of the nectarine's coat, di∣vided to give emission to her breath, discover∣ing a set of teeth vying with orient pearl.—</P>
<P>Her breath!—</P>
<P>I sat opposite to her—Her breath fanned me with a fragrance, infinitely more inspiring, not less odoriferous, than the evening zephyr of June, agitating a rose-thicket, stealing its
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
sweets <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="marg">If Mrs. DAWSON looks in her glass she will see an original resembling this picture.—</NOTE>.—The effect, however, was dif∣ferent; the fanning zephyr would have cool∣ed, but the southern blast that gathers con∣suming heat from the burning desert of Ara∣bia, could not scorch with more violence than the breath of my fellow-traveller.—</P>
<P>All appeared quiet within the peaceful ha∣bitation of her bosom, which, gently heav∣ing, preserved uninterrupted calmness, ex∣cept when a half-suppressed sigh, or short breathing, broke in upon the regular serenity of its motion.</P>
<P>She sighed!—but her sighs were not the sighs of sorrow—neither were they the sighs of pain—they were the sighs of sensibility—and I discovered the nature of her sighs, by the gentle agitations of pleasure, which ever pre∣ceded their risings, as tender harbingers, or fol∣lowed them as affectionate attendants.—</P>
<P>It is probable the lady was in a dream, if she was, it was a dream of such sensibility,
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
she might be said to wake sleeping <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>Critics may object to this expression, but it is certainly allowable at this time, when the greatest men <HI>sleep</HI> waking.—</P>
<P>I do believe it to be true, that dreams are certain interpreters of our inclinations.—I dream but sel∣dom, and my dreams are generally produced by plea∣sant thoughts.—MONTAIGNE.</P>
<P>It is no wonder if those <HI>things,</HI> which men think on, have an affection for, and practise when waking, should agitate their minds when they are asleep.— CICERO.</P>

<HEAD>An Expostulation with <HI>SLEEP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Why dost thou detain me so long from my friends? —Shall I never get free from the cells of delusive imaginations?—Shall I be for another hour dead to sentiment, to the world, and to myself? When am I to walk out of thy yawning palace, and be alive to action and joy once more?—I will be revenged on thee, for I will abhor the name of every thing that sooths and fawns upon me to become thy captive: —detested be the poppy and laudanum; detested be the sparkling liquor that enervates the powers; and thrice detested be the downy bed!—Never more may I become thy prey.—The days of my life are but short, and let them be spent in the improvements of <HI>action,</HI> and in the service of my country and my friends!—Vain hope! for I feel that I can no longer resist thy soporisic vengeance.</P>

<HEAD>THE WAGGON RUT.</HEAD>
<P>THE road was smooth—the coach rolled on—the lady slept—but as she slept, she slipt.—</P>
<P>The cushion on which she sat gently gave way—perceiving her in danger of falling, and anxious to prevent it, I placed my feet close to her's.—This precaution immediately trans∣ferred the point of gravity from the feet to the knee, and the coach continuing to com∣municate its motion to the lady, no sooner were her feet stopped, than her knees natu∣rally bent forward.—</P>
<P>Determined to support her, I gently slipt forward till our knees met.—</P>
<P>For above a mile we rolled along the road foot to foot, knee to knee—the coach conti∣nuing to communicate motion to the lady, the lady communicating motion to me—till,
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
unfortunately, the road growing rough, the motion increased, and became irregular—I lost my situation—the lady lost her situation of consequence.</P>
<P>Still the lady slept—and smiled—and sigh∣ed—and slipped, unconscious of her danger; but the coach-wheel slipping into a <HI>waggon-rut,</HI> I slipt forward, the lady slipt downward, and my <HI>Lord Coke,</HI> who had lain unnoticed upon the seat, ever since I came into the coach in the morning, slipt down at the same in∣stant with the lady; but luckily reaching the bottom of the carriage first, his lordship broke her fall.</P>
<P>I did all in my power to support her, but in vain—though the lady did every thing she could to support herself, and my <HI>Lord Coke</HI> lent his assistance.—</P>
<P>The accident appeared beyond remedy,— So being on my knees, I offered up a hasty, yet warm, sincere ejaculation to the great God of Love, who lending an ear auspicious to my prayer, in about two minutes I was extricated from—no—not extricated from my confusion,
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
but extricated from my aukward position, and found myself able to replace the lady in her seat—</P>
<P>Having settled the lady, I took up my <HI>Lord Coke,</HI> and placed his lordship close by her.</P>

<HEAD>A REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING got out of the <HI>rut,</HI> and having passed the <HI>rough road,</HI> which caused the foregoing accident, the coach rolled on smoothly again.—</P>
<P>Now there are many travellers who would rail for an hour without intermission against these <HI>rough spots,</HI> which every man must some∣times meet upon his journey, let him travel what road he will.—Some men meet them on <HI>high roads,</HI> some men meet them on <HI>bye roads.</HI>—Some men meet them on mountains. —Some men meet them in <HI>vallies.</HI>—They in∣terrupt the rich man in his chariot, and the poor man on the humble foot-path way. —Philosophers have met these <HI>rough spots</HI> upon the summit of the Alps, the <HI>virtuosi</HI> have met them in the streets of Rome.—Nay, it has been said, that very wise and grave philo∣sophers have met them on the very carpets of
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
their libraries. For my part, I meet them here and there, and every where, and where∣ever I meet them, whether on high road, or on bye road, on mountain, on valley, or on plain, I make the most of them. Wherever I travel, or in whatever manner I travel, whe∣ther I travel in a carriage, on horse-back, or on foot, I never abuse them.—</P>
<P>Thank Heaven! there is a complacency in my disposition, which bids defiance to trifling casualties; and whether the road be <HI>rough,</HI> or whether the road be <HI>smooth,</HI> my temper is still the same, and I never quarrel with the road, nor with myself, nor with any thing I meet, but go whistling on—I only wish I may never meet these rough spots on Mount Aetna, on Mount Vesuvius, or on any other <HI>burn∣ing</HI> mount.—I care not how <HI>warm</HI> the climate is—but Heaven preserve me from <HI>volcanos!</HI> —I have an implacable aversion to <HI>fire!</HI>—</P>
<P>A road may be considered as an emblem of life, and much instruction may be picked up in very few miles travelling; yet some there are, and men of great name, who have tra∣velled
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
to Egypt, and have attained nothing but the height of the Pyramids, or a sketch of the Sphynx, though they have written whole volumes upon what they <HI>have seen,</HI> and have not <HI>seen</HI>;—while others have been able to dis∣cover a thousand objects, in a space not lon∣ger than from London to Highgate, upon which they have exercised all the benignity of philanthrophy.—</P>
<P>A road, I say, may be considered as an em∣blem of life.—How various the prospect on the right and on the left!—Sometimes a se∣rene, sometimes a cloudy sky.—How diffe∣rent are the passengers in their size, in their complexion, and in the manner of pursuing their journey?—What innumerable stops from turnpikes!—What a number of cross roads! —How many arrests from accidents!—And how few make for the same resting-place, or pursue one certain constant gait.</P>
<P>This now is philosophizing—that is, if to philosophize, be, as has been defined by some philosophers, according to Montaigne, to write at random, and play the fool, as the es∣sayist
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
did, and which I shall never blush at doing, let my subject be what it may, pro∣viding only, that when I do write at random, or play the fool, my writing and my folly may be marked with some of his features.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONFUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE sun had now risen considerably above the horizon—the kine had returned to their pastures, having paid their milky tribute to the dairy—and the honest hind, whose la∣bour enables the luxuriant and the lazy, to indulge in pleasures, in sensuality and sloth, while he experienced the effects of the first judgment, announced by the divine wisdom against our primitive parents, by earning his bread with the sweat of his brow, softened its rigour with a chearful song, expressive of content.</P>
<P>Every object looked sprightly—every ob∣ject appeared gay—every object wore the ju∣venile dress of summer—every object, ani∣mate and inanimate, contributed a share of chearfulness to the scene.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="39"/>The situation in which the lady had disco∣vered herself on waking, had overwhelmed her with confusion. A blush of the deep∣est dye, far beyond the boasted Tyrian, diffused its colour through her veins, sometimes de∣scending, it spread over her fair bosom, and then, as if exhaled by the fire of her bright eyes, rose to her face, and revelled in a rubid glow.</P>
<P>The deep colour did not continue long— it faded by degrees to a rosy tint, but not to a fixed complexion—it sported during the course of our journey, in delicate shades. It was not difficult to discover what the lady felt —it was evident, from the revulsion of her blood, that the soul laboured, and the body languished.</P>
<P>If my confusion was not equal to the lady's, nor lasting as the confusion which distressed her, I felt an equal share of irrita∣tion. It was my ardent wish to relieve her, if possible, though I stood in need of relief myself. I would have roused my spirits, but they had been so lately dispersed, it was im∣possible
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
to recruit them suddenly—I did all I could to rally them, but in vain. I looked to the lady for assistance—the lady looked from me, as demanding assistance for herself —our nerves thrilled in unison—the vibra∣tion was sympathetic—the tremor was reci∣procal—so had been the cause.</P>
<P>I looked again towards the lady, taking her at the same instant by the hand—the vital spirits began to revive from the lethargy they had lately sunk into—the lady's hand lay in mine, a gentle mutual compressure gave my spirits the first alarm.</P>
<P>As I looked towards the lady, she turned her head round towards me, just so much as to give the profile of her face. A gentle sigh, with a soliciting cast of the eye informed me, she expected relief at my hands. My heart felt the full force and propriety of the ex∣pectation—it almost amounted to reproach. But how should I relieve her? My ideas were astray, my tongue was tied, and could as well have answered calmly from the rack, to the interrogatories of a persecuting Spanish in∣quisitor,
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
as commence a conversation with my fair companion.</P>
<P>Neither of us could articulate a word— yet though silent, we conversed—for the lady by degrees looking full in my face, our eyes spoke, and we perfectly understood each other —it was the language of <HI>nature,</HI> whose de∣clarations were sincere, <HI>her</HI> thoughts are un∣disguised, and scorn the deformities of du∣plicity.</P>
<P>You should speak to me, said the lady, from <HI>charity</HI>—</P>
<P>Something for the sake of <HI>charity,</HI> said a young seaman, who had lost an arm and a leg privateering, something for charity, said the seaman, as the coachman pulled up to the door of a small public house to take a dram <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">It is very common for stage-coachmen and post-boys to stop, for the purpose of drinking <HI>drams,</HI> both in England and Ireland.—<BIBL>TWISS's <HI>Travels.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>, and receive some parcels.</P>
<P>A moment before I would most willingly have purchased this interruption at any ex∣pence,
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
being now relieved from embarrass∣ment by the lady's having opened the con∣versation, I wished the seaman had lost his head instead of his arm—just as my peevish temper suggested the inhuman thought, the poor fellow, addressing himself to the lady, and turning from me, said, Madam, I have lost my arm in the service of my country— and he held up his stump.</P>
<P>This man, who had faced the horrors of war undaunted, this man who had faced death in a thousand different shapes undismayed, was scared by the inhospitable, the ungracious and forbidding look, vexation had thrown into my countenance.</P>
<P>I was preparing to recompense the injury I intended him, by my wish, which was now retorted with full force upon myself, by giving him the silver I had put into the purse I had prepared for the highwayman—but as I drew the purse from my pocket, AVARICE whispered in my ear, he has <HI>Greenwich</HI> to support him, or if not, he has his parish to maintain him. <HI>Burrow</HI>'s Settlement Cases
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
lay upon the seat opposite to me, close to <HI>Lord Coke.</HI>—The <HI>law</HI> has made a provision for him, said <HI>Sir James Burrow.</HI></P>
<P>CHARITY whispered in the opposite ear to that which AVARICE had applied her mouth to—this was the <HI>further</HI> ear from the poor sailor—but her words sunk deep into my soul.</P>
<P>It is certainly an <HI>honour</HI> to the <HI>law,</HI> whis∣pered <HI>Charity,</HI> that it makes a provision for the poor, but it is no great honour to <HI>human nature,</HI> that the law has <HI>need</HI> to make such provision</P>
<P>The <HI>intention</HI> of the <HI>law</HI> is good, said <HI>Sir James Burrow</HI>—but the hundreds of decisions upon <HI>Charity</HI> cases which I have collected, have swallowed up more of the <HI>provision</HI> allotted the poor, than even the <HI>overseers</HI> have swallow∣ed up—the poor are starved between the ex∣penditures of <HI>litigation</HI> and <HI>gormandizing</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>It was the opinion of the Court of King's Bench, upon an application to <HI>increase</HI> the overseers of the poor in a certain parish, that the <HI>distresses</HI> of the poor bore a <HI>proportion</HI> to the number of <HI>overseers</HI> appointed to take care of them.—J.

<P><PB N="41" REF="44"/>I had the purse half up, when VANITY stepping in with her advice, and aiding the solicitations of CHARITY, induced me to draw it to the very edge of my pocket.— A few acts of generosity, said VANITY, prudently managed, will give you as much reputation for goodness as most men desire.</P>
<P>Shall I, said I to myself—shall I restrain the stream of charity that overflows my heart? Shall I retain, for the purpose of some selfish gratification, this trash, taking the few shil∣lings out of the purse; this trash, which di∣vine bounty designed for the common benefit of all mankind.—The opportunities and in∣ducements we have to alleviate the miseries, and promote the happiness of our fellow-crea∣tures, are innumerable.

<P>A fat prebendary, well-mounted, and at∣tended by two servants in livery, came ambling up, all in fine order—no determining which
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
was best fed, the fat prebendary, the fat pre∣bendary's servants, or the fat prebendary's horses—sleek and fat—fat and sleek—nothing of a curate, or a curate's man, or a curate's horse, about them—lean and pale—pale and lean.—God bless your Reverence! said the maimed seaman, holding out his hat with his left hand, at the same time shewing the stump of his right arm to the fat prebendary.</P>
<P>The fat prebendary returned the blessing with the voice of meekness—God bless you! said the fat prebendary—joining his hands to∣gether, with his eyes elevated religiously to∣wards heaven, God bless you, said his reve∣rence, turning down his eyes, and looking on the seaman's stump, the prebendary gently spurred his horse and rode on—</P>
<P>Your <HI>honours</HI> will remember me, said the <HI>seaman,</HI> addressing himself to the prebendary's <HI>servants.</HI>—The prebendary's servants looked as if they said <HI>Amen</HI> to their master's prayers. —The horses neighed—but they were brutes.—What was the fat prebendary!—
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
What were the fat prebendary's servants!— Christians! Christians!</P>
<P>A serjeant of the guards, with his knapsack flung at his shoulders, holding a child by the one hand, and his wife following, carrying another child, succeeded.</P>
<P>Brother soldier, can you spare a trifle to a poor seaman? said the mutilated tar.</P>
<P><HI>D—n your eyes,</HI> answered the serjeant, here's all I can spare; and he threw six-pence into the seaman's hat.—The wife followed the example of her husband—she dropped her <HI>mite,</HI> and passed on; O may that <HI>mite</HI> be layed up in Heaven! and may the scanty pit∣tance in the corner of your husband's knap∣sack, increase like the widow's cruse!—</P>
<P>The serjeant's curse cut me to the heart— I reproached myself, blessed him, and curs∣ing the fat prebendary, the fat prebendary's fat servants, and the fat prebendary's fat horses (though sure I wronged the beasts) slipped the shillings I had held <HI>clinched</HI> in my hand, into the hand of the seaman—I slipped them into his hand, unknown to any one—
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
almost unknown to myself—in truth, VA∣NITY had nothing to say to the gift, it was the gift of an impulse, involuntarily spring∣ing from the noble motive of compassion, which the example set me by the serjeant, had instantaneously kindled in my breast.—</P>
<P>The lady also felt the force of the serjeant's <HI>damn,</HI> and contributed under its impulse to the seaman's wants.</P>
<P>I insert this <HI>damn</HI> of the serjeant, as a pre∣cept for the edification of a certain bench, and all those who derive authority under them —but they want not <HI>precept</HI>—it is in <HI>prac∣tice</HI> they are deficient.—<HI>Do</HI> as I <HI>say,</HI> is the great foundation of their preaching.—Why can they not preach, do as I <HI>do?</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PROPOSAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE human mind should ever be employed, mental exercise and industry being as es∣sential to the health of the <HI>soul,</HI> as corporeal exercise and labour is to the health of the body. Idleness in the mind produces <HI>vice,</HI> idleness in the body produces disease. The vacant hours of dulness are the most dangerous hours of life, for when ever the <HI>tempter</HI> of mankind, who is always on the watch, finds the mind out of employment, he never fails to step in, with one or other vicious incite∣ment to seduce the soul from virtue.</P>
<P>For this reason I have established as a rule in the mental code by which I govern myself, that when ever I find my mind inadequate to the exercises of study or rational contempla∣tion, which is too often the case, to seek im∣mediate employment for my ideas in some innocent amusement.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="50"/>It is certainly the most probable way of avoiding the <HI>devil</HI> and all his <HI>works.</HI></P>
<P>I never <HI>stood</HI> in greater necessity for the ap∣plication of my <HI>rule</HI> than at the present in∣stant.—Was my life to pay the forfeit, I could not enter into a serious conversation with the lady, or a proper conversation with myself; so finding it impossible to <HI>speak,</HI> and dreading the <HI>consequence</HI> of <HI>thinking,</HI> I resolved to dis∣appoint <HI>Old Nick</HI> by proposing an <HI>amusement.</HI></P>
<P>I asked the lady to play <HI>travelling piquet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TRAVELLING PICQUET.</HEAD>
<P>THE lady declared she was totally ignorant of the game.—</P>
<P>I once played the game, said I, when For∣tune being in a good-natured mood, as she was this day, introduced me to a <HI>tete à tete</HI> party with a young widow whom I met at <HI>Holy-head,</HI> and travelled with in a post coach to <HI>Chester.</HI>—</P>
<P>Then, said the lady, you are but a <HI>novice</HI> at the <HI>game</HI> yourself?</P>
<P>No, Madam, answered I, the young widow was <HI>experienced</HI> in it, and by her instructions, and playing it repeatedly since, I am now a perfect <HI>adept</HI> at the <HI>game,</HI>—and if you give permission, will instruct you.—</P>
<P>The lady, bowing, smiled assent to play, and I commenced my lesson.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="49" REF="52"/>
<HEAD>THE LESSON.</HEAD>
<P>SUPPOSE, Madam, said I, addressing myself to the lady, suppose, Madam, you and I,—or suppose, Madam, you and any other companion, were travelling in a coach, post-chaise, or <HI>vis à vis.</HI>—A <HI>vis à vis!</HI> ex∣claimed the lady, to ride in a <HI>vis à vis,</HI> is the height of my ambition.—</P>
<P>A <HI>vis à vis,</HI> Madam said I, is the most convenient carriage for playing <HI>travelling picquet</HI> in, twenty to one.—I proceeded in my instructions.</P>
<P>Suppose, Madam, you and I travel together in a carriage.—We <HI>are</HI> travelling together, observed the lady.—Well, Madam, you and I travelling together in a carriage, I reckon two for every gate <HI>I</HI> see on the <HI>right</HI> hand side of the road, you reckon two for every gate <HI>you</HI> see on the <HI>left</HI> hand side of the road, and
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
so according to agreement, a certain number is reckoned for every object seen by <HI>you,</HI> on your side of the road, or seen by me, on my side of the road, whether man or woman, horse or mare, bull or cow, ram or ewe, cock or hen, &amp;c.—</P>
<P>You understand me, Madam? said I,—</P>
<P>Perfectly, answered the lady.—</P>
<P>But observe, Madam—A man and woman —a horse and mare—a bull and cow—a ram and ewe—a cock and hen,—<HI>Et caetera,</HI> said the lady, interrupting my recapitulation—I went on—A man and woman, <HI>&amp; caetera,</HI> Madam, may chance to present themselves on your side of the road, or on my side of the road, so as to entitle you, Madam, or to entitle me, Madam, to a <HI>repique.</HI></P>
<P>You must explain that, said the lady—</P>
<P>Remember, Madam, said I—I don't say man <HI>or</HI> woman, horse <HI>or</HI> mare, &amp;c.—but man <HI>and</HI> woman, horse <HI>and</HI> mare, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Your reason, Sir, for the distinction? said the lady—</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54"/>Doctor <HI>Lowth,</HI> Madam, now bishop of London, and all learned Grammarians, in∣form us, that <HI>or</HI> is a conjunction disjunctive—</P>

<P>No, Sir—</P>
<P>Well, Madam, they have all laid it down that AND is a <HI>conjunctive-copulative.</HI>—</P>
<P>The lady hummed a tune.</P>
<P>You now understand the game, Madam? The lady hummed on.—</P>
<P>If you don't understand it, Madam, the fault is not with you, nor with me, nor with the bishop of London, nor with the other
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
learned grammarians; and I swear by <HI>Moses</HI>' rod, which rod was greater than all the rods of all the Egyptian Magi, or by the scepter with which the great Mogul <HI>attempts</HI> to rule the beauties in his seraglio, the fault should not be imputed to <HI>nature</HI>—she has given us un∣derstanding sufficient to understand all <HI>things</HI> that should be understood.</P>

<P>We will find out the place presently, Madam.</P>

<HEAD>THE REPIQUE.</HEAD>
<P>THE prospect on my side being beautiful, naturally drew the lady's eyes that way to view it. We were admiring the landscape, when a country lad and lass, who appeared fatigued with the labour of the morning, for the lass walked leaning upon the lad's arm, having arrived at the shady side of a hillock, sat down—</P>
<P>I reckoned four to my game.—</P>
<P>The lad gave the lass a <HI>kiss</HI>—by the rule of the game I was entitled to reckon two more.—</P>
<P>He kissed her again—again—and again— I foresaw the game would be my own—<HI>En∣core,</HI> said I—</P>

<P>It will be said I have imitated STERNE. I have heard of an author who wrote a play in imitation of Shakespear, the play was a good play enough, and had one line strongly
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
imitative of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s manner, which line was "good morrow, good master lieutenant." —It will be said I imitate STERNE—It is true like STERNE, my pen guides me, I don't guide my pen. I write my thoughts liberally, unstudied, and unarranged, as they spontane∣ously arise to my imagination, without culti∣vation or pruning,—of consequence they will be deficient in <HI>ornament,</HI> in <HI>profit,</HI> and in <HI>strength</HI>—but if they are <HI>natural</HI> I am satisfied.</P>
<P>I have always read STERNE with delight, and never read him but I felt him in my heart more than in my head; yet I hope his precepts have improved my understanding in the same proportion they have expanded my humanity. His precepts affect me like <HI>wine,</HI> they make my heart glad,—they affect me like <HI>love,</HI> or rather they affect me like a <HI>conjunction</HI> of <HI>love and wine,</HI> for they make me generous and gay. Imbibing his opinions has sweetened whatever portion of acidity, Nature, Mis∣fortune, and Disappointment have mixed in my composition; and having grafted them upon my heart, it is probable their emana∣tions

<P>If I should exhibit any feature bearing likeness to STERNE, I shall be proud of the similarity; but for this happiness I can scarcely hope.

<HEAD>THE CRITIQUE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>If STERNE was ever <HI>rivalled</HI> in the descriptive, the narrative, in language, or in the sentimental, it is by <HI>Mr. M'Dermott,</HI> in his new publication of the FEMALE MONITOR; the history of <HI>Ara∣bella</HI> is one of the most masterly drawings of the <HI>human pen.—Locke, Hume,</HI> and many other ce∣lebrated authors have favoured us with essays on education, but <HI>in</HI> Arabella <HI>they live,</HI> and theory rendered practicable by sweet and easy admonition; the strictures of the Female Monitor, with the author's own digressions, are admirably interwoven in the piece, and <HI>forms</HI> a most instructive and agree∣able dialogue: the letters from Mr. Worthy to his son Charles, at Oxford, are <HI>sterling,</HI> and <HI>abounds</HI> with honourable precepts and information; the description of the old half-pay officer, given by Charles, is one of those most affecting, a <HI>senti∣mental situation</HI> that demands the <HI>tear of admi∣ration,</HI> and plucks the <HI>laurel</HI> from the <HI>Monk of Calis.</HI>—Lady Gay's <HI>career</HI> through life is <HI>dramati∣cally conceived,</HI> and gives <HI>precept</HI> a <HI>risible</HI> cast judiciously introduced to close the scene.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>name</HI> of the author of the FEMALE MONI∣TOR, as well as the <HI>modesty</HI> which marks this <HI>critique,</HI> clearly points out the country which had the honour of giving him birth, a circumstance which in <HI>my</HI> opinion, must recommend him to all <HI>mammas,</HI> all <HI>mams</HI> of boarding schools, and <HI>private governesses</HI> of young ladies, particularly as the <HI>critique</HI> declares the work to be the most masterly drawing of the <HI>human pen</HI>; which shews that the work, like many other works, does not carry the <HI>traits</HI> of the <HI>goose-quill:</HI> indeed it goes a great way to prove, the certainty of an old opinion, that <HI>Irishmen</HI> have <HI>wings,</HI> and out of some of their pinions perhaps, Mr. M'Dermott's <HI>human pen</HI> was plucked. But I find it impossible to <HI>conceive</HI> (though I have called in my husband's aid to my as∣sistance) the following assertion.—"<HI>Locke, Hume,</HI> and <HI>many other</HI> celebrated authors have favoured us with essays on education, but <HI>in</HI> ARABELLA <HI>they</HI> live;" now as <HI>Locke</HI> and <HI>Hume</HI> are indubitably <HI>dead,</HI> and we have not heard of their <HI>resurrection,</HI> how comes it that <HI>they</HI> live in <HI>Arabella</HI>; indeed were they <HI>alive,</HI> it is out of nature to suppose they should <HI>live</HI> so long <HI>in Arabella</HI>; for though <HI>Jonas</HI> lived a consi∣derable time in the <HI>whale's belly,</HI> his life was pre∣served by miracle, and he was but <HI>one</HI> person; whereas it appears, that <HI>Arabella</HI> is <HI>ensient,</HI> that is, big with <HI>Locke, Hume,</HI> and several <HI>other</HI> authors. It is true, a certain dutchess of <HI>Heidleberg</HI> had three hundred and sixty-five <HI>children</HI> at a birth; and the font in which they were christened, is still shewn in the great church of the town; but then these were children, not men. But perhaps the critique upon Mr. M'Der∣mott's work does not mean that the <HI>philosophers</HI> and authors are <HI>in</HI> poor <HI>Arabella</HI> in a state of <HI>tran∣substantiation,</HI> but only in <HI>Spirit,</HI> which the author of the <HI>Female Monitor</HI> might believe, if he admits the doctrine of <HI>Metempsychosis,</HI> or transmigration of <HI>souls</HI>; for though a woman could not rightly enter∣tain so many <HI>men</HI> in <HI>ventra semere,</HI> corporally, yet she might entertain them <HI>spiritually,</HI> as may be proved from the number of <HI>devils,</HI> sometimes a whole <HI>legion</HI> together, which have <HI>possessed</HI> persons in former times.—CATHARINE MAC. GRA—M.</P>
<P>The FEMALE MONITOR certainly demands the <HI>tear</HI> of <HI>admiration,</HI> whenever admiration <HI>weeps</HI>; but I cannot think there was much sentiment in the author's plucking the <HI>laurel</HI> from the <HI>Monk of Calais,</HI> by which I suppose he must mean "<HI>the few scattered white hairs upon his temples.</HI>"—</P>

—This comedy wants <HI>novelty,</HI> it being acted every hour, in every great house, in every great square, and every great street in this great metropolis; and therefore as human nature is invariable, the merit of the author of the MAN OF THE WORLD, consists in nothing more, than exhibiting in dramatic form and dialogue, the customs and habits, which have unavoidably taken place, and characterize the history of the day.</P>
<P>Having touched a little upon <HI>imitation</HI> and literary thieving, I will now state a few un∣arranged thoughts on <HI>similarity</HI> of thinking.—</P>
<P>The <HI>variety</HI> we see in the persons, in the faces, and in the modes of thinking, which distinguish the individuals who compose the human animal, are astonishing! But <HI>variety</HI> and <HI>contrast</HI> in the appearance and manners of man, are necessary to the purposes of his be∣ing, and shew the infinite wisdom and infinite power of his Creator.</P>
<P>From variety and contrast of person we judge of proportion, and the elegance of symmetry.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/>From variety and contrast of face, we judge of beauty and of ornament.</P>
<P>And from variety and contrast of thinking, we judge of intellectual capacity, as it ope∣rates in the progress of its study upon sciences, and its invention and improvement in the arts.</P>
<P>So that it may be said, that the knowledge of all arts, and the knowledge of all sciences, which include the knowledge of all things, is the consequence of variety in our modes of thinking, and contrast in our opinions; which variety and contrast, stimulate us to controversy and experiment. And as <HI>virtue</HI> would not have been known but for the con∣trast of <HI>vice,</HI> nor <HI>colours</HI> but for the <HI>variety</HI> of their <HI>shades,</HI> neither would arts nor sciences have been known, had the organs of mankind been so formed that <HI>every</HI> individual should think alike.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding the versatile sportings of nature in forming her creatures, we often find a strong similitude of person, a strong similitude of face, and a strong similitude in
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>

<HEAD>WINDSOR. THE INN.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING arrived at WINDSOR, and handed the lady out of the coach into the inn, we were shewed into a parlour by the landlord, in his proper person. Here a very serious difficulty started, which never occurred, at least to me, during the whole course of the journey.—How am I to part with my fellow-traveller, thought I—Ay, "there is the rub," and a severe rub it was —I was totally ignorant of the lady's name —the lady was totally ignorant of my name. —It is true, I knew <HI>something</HI> about her, but a motive, in which curiosity had the smallest share, made me wish most ardently to know <HI>every thing</HI> about her.—No sooner had I per∣ceived
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
this inclination, for gaining an <HI>inti∣mate knowledge</HI> of the <HI>lady,</HI> and the <HI>lady</HI>'s <HI>af∣fairs,</HI> than I flattered myself, that the lady felt as ardent an inclination, to be intimately acquainted with <HI>me,</HI> with <HI>every thing</HI> about me, and with <HI>my affairs.</HI>—I not only wished to know her, but to know all her connec∣tions.—I asked myself a thousand questions about her, without putting one question to her.—</P>
<Q><P>Who is she?</P>
<P>Whence came she?</P>
<P>Who is her father?</P>
<P>Who is her mother?</P>
<P>Who are her brothers?</P>
<P>Who are her sisters?</P>
<P>Has she any brothers and sisters, un∣cles, aunts, or cousins?</P></Q>
<P>These questions I put deliberately to my∣self, stringing them together in succession, as the facetious <HI>Sancho Panza,</HI> the laugh-and-be-fat-sub-hero of <HI>Don Quixote</HI>'s adventures, strung his proverbs.— But no sooner had I finished my interrogatories upon her relations,
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
than a multitude of other interrogatories rushed in upon my mind impetuously—</P>
<Q>Is she a maid?</Q>
<P><HI>Find that out,</HI> would have been the proper answer.—</P>
<Q><P>Is she a wife?</P>
<P>Is she a widow?</P></Q>
<P>Is she neither maid, wife, nor widow?—</P>
<Q><P>Is she a mistress?</P>
<P>Is she rich?</P></Q>
<P>That is no business of mine.—</P>
<Q>Is she poor?</Q>
<P>Not in <HI>spirit,</HI> for to me she has been most liberal; and if she wants assistance, to reple∣nish her purse, or to right her wrongs, by Heaven my purse, (I was master of forty-eight guineas, which was within two guineas of my quarter's allowance) and my sword, (which, though of old mourning-mounting, had an excellent blade, of genuine Toledo temper) are both at her service.—</P>

<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>WE stood in a parlour of the inn, our hands locked within each other.—It would be hard, Madam, said I, sighing, after the pleasant journey we have experienced, to part as ignorant of each other as we met.— It shall not be my fault, said the lady, if we are not longer acquainted; I am come to spend a few weeks at Windsor, and if you wish to continue an intimacy, which <HI>acci∣dent</HI> produced, and, added I, interrupting her, which <HI>love</HI> assisted.—Love! alas, said the lady, shaking her head, there was no <HI>love</HI> in the case, our meeting, and every thing that has happened since we met, were the effects of <HI>accident</HI>—assisted by <HI>nature</HI>; then, Madam, said I, bowing, and laying my hand upon my heart—and what is <HI>love,</HI> but <HI>nature?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="87"/>Thelady blushed, but silently assented to my opinion, which she illustrated by a sentimental gentle squeeze of the hand —I thanked her for the compliment, by returning the squeeze in the same sentimental gentle manner I had received it; and raising her hand to my lips, "she nothing loath," kissed it with the ge∣nuine fervour of affection and sincerity.— The lady recovered her spirits, and the whole force of those spirits starting into her eyes, her bosom heaving with a heart-easing sigh; alas! said she, with an amiable frankness, I must acknowledge the propriety of your ob∣servation.—LOVE IS THE CHILD OF NA∣TURE! But I must sincerely regret, that mere <HI>accident</HI> has convinced me of this truth. —How happy should I have been, if a long acquaintance, matured into friendship and a series of reciprocal obligations, had been the means of my conviction—how happy should I have been, if it had been my fortune to have <HI>loved</HI> from the result of <HI>judgment,</HI> not from the effect of <HI>contingency,</HI> and she wept.—</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88"/>Now the lady's tears were <HI>natural,</HI> but it was unnatural to suppose, that <HI>love</HI> could re∣sult from <HI>judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I acknowledge, continued the lady, wip∣ing her eyes, I acknowledge we are some∣times excuseable for yielding to the simple authority of <HI>nature:</HI> but what have I done? I have suffered myself to be hurried away, to be transported by her tyrannical dictates; whereas reason alone, should have authority over the conduct of our inclinations,—She wept again.—I felt the full force of her tears —they were a dew, which nourished my in∣fant passion.—</P>
<P>Falling upon one knee, with faultering speech, I swore never to part from her. —Her countenance brightened, on hearing my vow—she appeared happy—her looks touched my very soul, our happiness was mu∣tual—and surely the pleasure which the be∣nevolent mind feels in the happiness of others, is one of the most delightful sensations with which the human soul is blest.</P>

<HEAD>A QUESTION ANSWERED.</HEAD>
<P>QUESTION—What is LOVE?—</P>
<P>ANSWER.—Love is a desire of con∣tracting friendship, of uniting with, and com∣municating happiness to a beautiful object; every eye making its own beauty.—Love is active, eager, sharp, precipitate.—Love is fickle, moving, and inconstant; love is a fe∣ver, subject to intermissions and paroxysms— But give me that love, which when the pa∣roxysms have subsided, retains an universal fire <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Those who intend to try my <HI>celestial</HI> beds, may be assured, that the consequence will be, that after experiencing the paroxysms of pleasure, they will also experience an <HI>universal fire,</HI> electrifying their whole frame, as an emblem of which, I have placed <HI>Mercury</HI> over my temple.—<BIBL>GRAHAM, D.

<P><PB N="87" REF="90"/>Yet love is a tyrant!—All passions are ty∣rants, but love is the greatest tyrant of all the passions; for love holds all the other passions under arbitrary subjection—love leads every man by the <HI>nose</HI> <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">The word NOSE , as it <HI>stands</HI> here, should not have been <HI>italicked,</HI> but should have been written in the old ROMAN or old IRISH characters.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
<HEAD>A REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>I Directly returned to the inn—and going into the parlour, looked out of the window towards the royal palace—this is WINDSOR, said I to myself, Windsor, so renowned in an∣cient story! —Windsor, so celebrated in an∣cient song.</P>
<P>And here our Edward's and our Henry's have resided, have sported in the chace, and exercised at the tournament.—</P>
<P>This is Windsor, rendered immortal by immortal Pope, and now the residence of the most numerous progeny, that ever royalty produced.—Priam, it is true, had sixty sons, but how many <HI>wives</HI> had Priam?—</P>
<P>The prospect, I was informed, from the castle-terrace, was truly beautiful, but the town is cursed straggling, and cursed incon∣venient.—I took out my watch to see the
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
hour—mercy preserve me! exclaimed I, it is but a few hours since I left London, and what a number of incidents have marked that short space of time.—Every circumstance rushed upon my memory—I found myself un∣easy—something was wanting—I sighed, and my sighing told me it was my fair companion —but she was gone.—</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
<HEAD>THE OVERSIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>WAS there ever such an oversight!— was there ever such a fool as I have been, to let her depart without enquiring her name—perhaps I may never see—perhaps I may never hear of her more—prudence, on reflection, may induce her to conceal her∣self.—</P>
<P>I rung for my servant, asked him the lady's name, but to enquire the lady's name had ne∣ver entered into his head, no more than it had entered into mine.—I eased my chagrin, by severely reproving his negligence, though my uneasiness was the result of my own stu∣pidity.—</P>
<P>My servant had spirit, and I had always indulged him in a free exercise of it—he re∣taliated my reproof, by telling me he had no orders to enquire after the name of the lady;
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
but, said he, with an arch significant smile, I know the name of the country girl, who rode with me upon the outside of the coach. —I felt the sarcasm, I saw the fellow triumph, and could have knocked him down.</P>
<P>Raging with vexation and disappointment, I had the coachman called—the coachman knew nothing about her—I had the waiters called, —the waiters knew nothing about her—I al∣most stormed, and snatching up my hat, was proceeding to sally out upon an expedition of reconoitering and enquiry, when my servant gave a half smack with his mouth, and in∣formed me I had not ordered any thing for dinner.—</P>
<P>I left him to indulge his own palate in the orders, but meeting the landlord in the entry, he presented a long bill of fare—you may have, Sir, said the landlord, and he run thro' his bill of fare, throwing his eyes up for my command as he repeated each article—you may have venison, fowls, ducks, roast leg of lamb, pigeon-pie, mackarel, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Do you take me, said I, for an overseer of the
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
poor, or the bencher of an inn of court? Let me have a beef-steak—and I passed by the landlord.—</P>
<P>Getting into the street, I was as much at a loss as ever, to find out the lady, so enquir∣ing my way to the castle, I soon found my∣self upon the terrace.—</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
<HEAD>THE TERRACE.</HEAD>
<P>LOOKING round me, as I stood upon the terrace, I was astonished at the beauty of the prospect. The air was serene, the landscape inchanting, the sky clear, except a few clouds towards the horizon, which set off the brilliancy of its azure, as moles do the fairness of the human skin.—Some villas lay open to the view, others were in part con∣cealed, and the sun darted his mid-day beams to gild the various turrets and spires, which glistened through the scene.</P>
<P>The Thames rolled his silvered flood in silent majesty towards the sea, enriching his bordering banks with verdure and the bright∣est tints, and woods and forests, some planted by nature, time immemorial, others raised by the assisting hand of industry, waved their graceful pliant branches, and shook their leafy
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
honours—obedient to every gale. Between these woods, meadows, pastures, and gardens, at different distances, opening interminable, gave a luxuriant diversity to the whole.</P>
<P>Here gurgling brooks, gently meandering along their pebbly channels, pour their tribu∣tary urns into the sovereign river—and there a rich profusion of hillocks, tufted with va∣rious trees, among which groups of animals grazed, slept or play'd in peace and happiness, though different in their kinds.</P>
<P>The whole closed with an extended ho∣rizon, and charmed the soul with delightful grandeur—</P>
<P>Alas, said I, looking round, my soul elevated to enthusiasm—it was here our greatest English bards invoked and received the inspi∣ration of their muse.—</P>
<P>So taking out my pencil, I wrote in my pocket-book—the first lines of poetry I ever attempted.—</P>

<HEAD>DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<P>MY landlord being seated, and I having described my fellow-traveller to him as minutely as possible, expatiating upon her perfections as I touched upon them, that is, such of her <HI>perfections</HI> as <HI>distinguished</HI> her from the rest of her sex, for there are <HI>perfections common</HI> to them all—I say, having minutely described my fellow-traveller to my landlord, he run over a catalogue of the beauties of Windsor and the adjacent country; which he had at his tongue's end, with a most sur∣prizing flow of volubility, accuracy of de∣scription, point of sarcasm, and now and then, the sweetness of eulogium.—</P>
<P>If it was not for her black hair, said my landlord, I should be positive she was Miss A—.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136"/>Miss B— is too proud to travel in a stage-coach—therefore it cannot be Miss B—.</P>
<P>The widow C—has not been in London since her husband's death, he was buried on Monday; besides, I know she had a private card-party last night, so it is impossible, your honour, that this lady should be the widow C—</P>
<P>There is a young lady in the neighbour∣hood who answers your description, but she is continually practising smiles before the glass, to insnare the prince—no—no—it is not Miss D—.</P>
<P>You say, Sir, the lady is well-shaped and witty—now, if her back was broke, from her wit, I should really think she was Mrs. E—.</P>
<P>Miss F—has a roguish eye—but your lady's eyes are <HI>blue,</HI> and Miss F.'s are <HI>black</HI>; and she squints with her left eye, and is ever speaking scandal, so it cannot be Miss F—.</P>

<P>I Suppose, said I, pointing to the Ledger, which I had thrown aside, when dinner was served in, I suppose, my friend, that since the court has honoured Windsor with the light of its countenance, the inhabitants have become profound politicians?</P>
<P>I am of no party, answered my landlord— though to be sure, what with excise, and what with quartering of soldiers, a publican can scarce live—</P>
<P>But as taxes rise, you charge in propor∣tion, said I—</P>
<P>True, Sir, replied my landlord, we charge in proportion, but then our guests eat and drink in proportion; they order as <HI>little</HI> as possible, and eat as <HI>much</HI> as possible; that is, when they are charged for each article—but, Sir—if they dine at the ordinary, or agree
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
for so much a head, they eat as if it was the last meal they had to devour, and scarcely drink sufficient to wash the food down their throats.—Alas, Sir, I have had very few good companies in the drinking way, since the last general election; and those who drank then, drank at the expence of the candidates—</P>
<P>And what was your opinion, on that elec∣tion, said I—</P>
<P>Opinion—O, your honour, I never form∣ed any opinion on it—a man who depends upon the custom of the public, should ne∣ver have an opinion of his own.—I am not one of those public-spirited publicans who neglect their own business, to look after the affairs of the state—it is true, I hear a great deal of talk among my guests about the <HI>king's friends</HI> and <HI>opposition</HI>—now your <HI>king's friends,</HI> I take to be those who are friends to themselves—<HI>with</HI> success—and <HI>op∣position,</HI> I take to be those who have been friends to themselves—<HI>without</HI> success—there ever was, and there ever will be <HI>parties,</HI> your honour—

<HEAD>THE MESSAGE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD scarcely laid down the LEDGER, when my servant entered the room—his mouth extended to the dimension of a coun∣tertenor choirister's mouth, when vociferating "O thou that bringeth glad tidings to Sion." —He bounced in <HI>sans</HI> ceremony, and rubbing the palms of his hand together with a quick∣ness and zeal that intimated good news and satisfaction, told me he had found the Lady.—</P>
<P>And where is she, and what is her name? said I, leaping from my chair with the utmost eagerness.—I cannot say, Sir, answered my ser∣vant, where the Lady is, or who the Lady is, but a boy waits to deliver a letter to the Gen∣tleman who came down in the stage, he says it is from a Lady—and as I came down an <HI>outside</HI> passenger, it cannot be for me—and as
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
you, Sir, were the only gentlemen, <HI>inside</HI> passenger, I conclude it must be for you.—</P>
<P>I ordered the boy to be called in.—</P>
<P>He was a lad about fourteen, in a neat frock livery.—I have a letter, Sir, said the boy, without a direction, but my Mistress has ordered me to deliver it to the Gentleman who came to Windsor this day in the stage.— I held out my hand for the letter, tore it open, and read—</P>
<P><Q>I impute your omitting to enquire after my name, to emotions similar to those which agitated my bosom at the minute of our departure, and I suppose you have been travelling over the whole town to find me out.</Q>
—It is what I should have been doing, said I, stamping and cursing my remissness and stupidity—
<Q>if a more serious engagement does not call for your at∣tendance, I shall hope for your company as soon after you receive this as conveni∣ent; and you must conduct yourself before those you will see with me, as an old ac∣quaintance.</Q>
—MARIA.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159"/>My respects, said I, to your Mistress, slipping a trifle into the boy's hand—I shall wait upon her immediately.—The boy re∣tired.</P>
<P>In about ten minutes I was dressed.— These ten minutes appeared an hour.—In twenty minutes was at the house.—Never did <HI>necessitous</HI> tradesman, going humbly to petition a privileged <HI>great</HI> man, to pay a <HI>small</HI> debt of <HI>long</HI> standing, feel a more general agitation of nerves, or knock with a more trembling hand, than I felt, and than I knocked with, at the door of <HI>Maria</HI>'s lodg∣ings.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>TURNING my head aside accidentally, as I knocked at the door, I saw <HI>Maria</HI> peep over the window-blind; but when shewed into, the parlour, I found her sitting with her back turned towards the door, a book in her hand, supporting herself by her elbow, which rested on the arm of the chair. She was seemingly so lost in meditation, that had I not seen her peep over the parlour-blind, I should have thought she had neither heard me coming in, nor had seen me when I was in.—I gave a loud hem—the boy an∣nounced my entrance—"the Gentleman, Madam," and he withdrew.—</P>
<P><HI>Maria</HI> started from her seat as roused from a reverie.—I should have suspected her of duplicity, but the crimson glow that flushed in her cheek, convinced me that the pre∣tended
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
reverie was not a manoeuvre of ex∣perience or practised art, but an immediate consequence of amiable confusion.—</P>
<P>The moment our eyes met, I perceived and felt for <HI>Maria</HI>'s situation.—Suspicion fled, and the ardour of passion which suc∣ceeded, was instantly checked by the inter∣position of sentiment.—My eyes bent down∣wards —the confusion which revelled in her cheek had raised a tumult within her bosom. —Our feelings were mutual—our hands, guided by instinctive attraction, joined im∣perceptibly, till a reciprocal gentle pressure convinced us of their junction.—Passion stepped in again, but sentiment still kept her post—we sighed at one instant, as with one breath—at one instant we received relief—yet to speak was impossible—though <HI>Maria</HI>'s eyes expressed unutterable things—mine per∣haps were not without expression—at least <HI>Maria</HI> has since told me so.—</P>
<P>I had always an aversion to <HI>punctilio</HI>—no man in the world understands less, or pays less attention to those who practise <HI>ettiquette</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
than I do—but ceremony in the present in∣stance was out of the question. <HI>Nature</HI> pre∣dominated, and under her sweet influence I led the Lady to her chair, placed her on it, and placing myself upon another chair close by her, without uttering a single compli∣ment, or a single bow or courtsey being passed on my part or her's.—</P>
<P>I led her to her chair, "Grace was in all her steps." Grace, which the VESTRIS could never teach, nor nobility could never learn— for it is neither to be taught nor learned—it was the <HI>grace</HI> of Nature <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">If you were to see my little memorandum book, you would acknowledge, notwithstanding the above insinuation, that I taught several <HI>ladies</HI> the true <HI>natural grace,</HI> and have received large emolu∣ments for teaching the same; but the contents of this little book I shall keep <HI>secret,</HI> till safe upon the continent, when I shall <HI>publish</HI> it, as a grateful return for all <HI>favours</HI> received from the <HI>ladies</HI> of Great-Britain; and that my gratitude may not hereafter be called in question, I have added to my catalogue many <HI>favours</HI> which I <HI>never</HI> received, but which shall also be published.—<BIBL>THE VESTRIS.</BIBL></NOTE>.—It was such <HI>grace</HI> as her <HI>Grace</HI> the Dutchess of D— nor her <HI>Grace</HI> the Dutchess of R—never

<P>Two minuets passed without a word being uttered—they were golden minuets, worth a whole iron age.—</P>

<HEAD>TRISTRAM SHANDY.</HEAD>
<P>HAD <HI>Sterne,</HI> Madam, said I, as I opened the book—Had <HI>Sterne</HI> experienced such a tender meeting as the present, he could have written a whole volume upon the text.—</P>
<P>I was considering, answered <HI>Maria,</HI> when you came in, what a pity it was that <HI>Sterne</HI> lest the description of the <HI>Widow Wadman</HI>'s person and beauty to the imagination of his reader, and had not drawn the Lady's picture himself.—Alas! Madam, said I, had <HI>Sterne</HI> drawn the widow's picture, it would only have increased his enemies, and heaven knows, the benignity of his heart and sim∣plicity of his manners, had raised enough of them.—His description, Madam, would have pleased few but himself; the critics would have fallen foul upon it, would have dissected it to a hair, have tortured it limb by limb,
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
bedaubed it and besmutted it, for in the arti∣cle of beauty, we seldom find two men who think alike; some admire slender, some ad∣mire full waists <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">One of the first personages in this country in∣dulging with me in the amorous dalliance of a re∣tired <HI>tete à tete,</HI> gave me his opinion upon this sub∣ject; he declared his dislike to the antiquated figures of former days, described by <HI>Pope,</HI> "small by de∣grees, and beautifully less;" exclaiming at the same time in rapture—give me <HI>quantity</HI>—I despise <HI>quali∣ty!</HI> give me <HI>latitude</HI> and <HI>longitude</HI> in <HI>love!</HI>— <BIBL>ARMSTEAD, <HI>spinster.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>; a tint in the com∣plexion, or a shade in the colour of the eye, settles the admiration, and gives birth to passion.</P>
<P>It is the same with women, answered <HI>Maria,</HI> they are equally capricious in their likings and affections.—Some women like <HI>tall</HI> men—others like <HI>middle-sized,</HI> and some like <HI>short</HI> men.—</P>
<P>Being <HI>short</HI> myself, I made a low bow—</P>
<P>Your observation, Madam, said I, is just, an inch this way —or an inch that way)— may gain or lose the affections of a woman— and as to the affections of men, they are not

confined to beauty, to figure, or mental ac∣plishments; I have often remarked old men fond of green girls, and young fellows giving preference to full-blown beauty—but these are false appetites.—</P>
<P>False appetites? exclaimed <HI>Maria,</HI> start∣ing and looking towards heaven.—Alas! Sir, it is too true, that the devastation in the gar∣dens of beauty and innocence, are generally made by old wretches.—Her bosom heaved as if bursting—her whole frame was in agitation— I finished the sentence for her—old wretches who lay <HI>waste,</HI> but cannot <HI>enjoy</HI> the soil <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">We have remarked two old fellows of this diabolical cast, who constantly take their evening amusement, during the summer season, in Vauxhall gardens; and who in winter have old <HI>haradans</HI> in constant pay, priestesses to Satan, at whose shrine they nightly offer up human sacrifices.—<BIBL>F—L—H and H—S—G.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>A SHANDEAN CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>PERCEIVING the distress of my fair friend, though unable to account for the cause <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">The history of <HI>Maria</HI> shall be given in the course of this work, if the REVIEWERS will but as∣sist the sale of the first volume, by <HI>abusing</HI> it—<BIBL>THE AUTHOR.</BIBL></NOTE>, I changed the subject, by taking up <HI>Tristram Shandy,</HI> which I had laid upon the parlour-window, and accidentally open∣ing the page where the author promises a chapter upon <HI>button-holes</HI>; it is a pity, said I, turning to <HI>Maria,</HI> and affecting a sprightli∣ness to relieve her spirits—it is a pity, said I, that <HI>Tristram</HI> never filled this chapter—do you mean the <HI>black</HI> leaf, said <HI>Maria?</HI></P>
<P>I answered, no—</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="168"/>I could never penetrate into the moral of that dark page, said <HI>Maria</HI>—</P>
<P>I do believe, said I, it is an emblem of the black ingratitude of the world.</P>
<P>Then continued Maria, since you do not mean the black, you must mean the marble page; and that page is to me as inexplicable as the other—</P>
<P>I do not think, answered I, that there is any great difficulty to unravel the truths which lie mystically hid under the veil of the marble page—I consider it as a true picture of the <HI>hard</HI> marble <HI>heads</HI> and <HI>hard</HI> marble <HI>hearts</HI> of those envious dull ones, who persecuted him while living; and pray add, said <HI>Maria,</HI> of those unfeeling dull ones who could not understand or benefit by reading the dictates of his philanthropy—</P>
<P>I resumed the subject of the <HI>button-hole</HI>—</P>
<P>Had he filled his chapter upon button-holes, said I, it would have been delec∣table!—</P>
<P>He would have <HI>filled</HI> it in all probability, observed <HI>Maria,</HI> but poor fellow, you should
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
recollect his misfortune—you should recol∣lect he was grievously afflicted with a con∣suming <HI>asthma,</HI> the whole time he was com∣posing his works—</P>
<P>I see the force of your observation, said I, a man debilitated as he must have been, with death pursuing him at every step, and shak∣ing his dart at him upon every turn, had something more material to employ his <HI>mind,</HI> and of course employ his <HI>pen,</HI> than such trif∣ling subjects as <HI>button-holes.</HI></P>
<P>True, said <HI>Maria,</HI> but come, you appear in perfect health and spirits, so let me see what you can say upon the subject—here— is a blank page, continued <HI>Maria,</HI> taking Tristram Shandy out of my hand—here is a white blank page, turning over to chapter XXXVIII. in the IVth VOLUME; come, I will have an immediate proof of your literary abilities—</P>

<P>WHAT could <HI>Sterne</HI> possibly have said upon a <HI>button-hole?</HI></P>
<P>Would he have <HI>entered</HI> into its <HI>origin?</HI></P>
<P>Would he have described it with all its appendages and ornaments?</P>
<P>Would he have explained its uses, its shape, and its component parts?</P>
<P>Would he have given us all those ideas, which must consequently have arisen before his mind's eye in the course of considering and discussing the subject?</P>
<P>Heaven only knows whether he would have done <HI>all</HI> which these interrogatories enquire, but clear I am, that had he once taken the subject in hand, he would have done his <HI>best,</HI>

<P>But as I am not endowed with powers na∣tural nor acquired, corporeal nor intellectual, sufficient to support me, should I rashly at∣tempt to <HI>enter</HI> into so <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>profound</HI> a sub∣ject, a subject which would baffle the <HI>pens</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> or <HI>Sorbonne</HI>—a subject, which has exhausted whole folios of learning, and employed the leisure hours of the most learn∣ed men.—I will not presume, Madam, to in∣form you what a <HI>button-hole</HI> is, though hav∣ing <HI>seen</HI> many, and <HI>felt</HI> more, I will venture to tell you what a <HI>button-hole</HI> is <HI>like.</HI>—</P>
<P>The <HI>button-hole</HI> of a <HI>pocket</HI> being <HI>vertical,</HI> is like a <HI>parenthesis</HI> closed thus—☞()—</P>
<P>The <HI>button-hole</HI> of the <HI>breast</HI> being <HI>hori∣zontal,</HI> is also like a <HI>parenthesis,</HI> but inversed thus—☞ <FIGURE REND="inline">

<P>The <HI>second</HI> syllable will be <HI>thesis</HI>; now the <HI>button-hole</HI> is a <HI>thesis,</HI> which has produced much dispute in the world, <HI>nam fuit ante He∣lenam —cunnus causa deterrima bellis</HI>; for my part, I know nothing of the <HI>theory,</HI> but be∣ing naturally of an aguish constitution, am liable to <HI>hot-fits</HI> and <HI>cold-fits,</HI> which cause me to <HI>button</HI> or <HI>unbutton,</HI> as I am <HI>hot</HI> or <HI>cold</HI>; I have had my share of <HI>button-hole-practics</HI>—</P>

<P>With submission to their <HI>reverences,</HI> who are bound <HI>ex officio,</HI> to understand these things

better than laymen, I suppose that the but∣ton and <HI>button-hole,</HI> is as ancient as <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> and were first used by them in joining their <HI>fig-leaves together</HI>; for as our first pa∣rents had neither <HI>needle</HI> nor <HI>thread,</HI> is it possible the use of something like a <HI>button</HI> and <HI>button-hole</HI> was discovered by them—</P>
<P>And why not a <HI>needle</HI> and <HI>thread,</HI> Sir? Might not <HI>Adam</HI> procure a <HI>thorn</HI> for <HI>Eve,</HI> to serve as a <HI>needle,</HI> and might not <HI>Eve</HI> give a <HI>lock</HI> of her <HI>hair,</HI> to serve as a <HI>thread</HI>; and this <HI>needle</HI> and <HI>thread</HI> being thus procured, it is not possible, or at least probable, that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve stitched</HI> their <HI>fig-leaves together?</HI></P>
<P>Whether they <HI>buttoned</HI> or <HI>stitched</HI> their <HI>fig-leaves</HI> together, in my opinion does not signify a farthing—but the learned Hebraists think otherwise <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Several men of extensive learning, have written whole volumes in controverting such <HI>essential</HI> points of scripture, and frequently preach upon them to the great <HI>entertainment</HI> of <HI>themselves</HI> and <HI>pu∣nishment</HI> of their <HI>auditors</HI>—P—R—Y, D.

<HEAD>TWO CHARACTERS.</HEAD>
<P>MARIA returned just as I had closed the book, and desired me to follow her, re∣peating her caution, that I should conduct myself as an old acquaintance—she ushered me into a drawing-room, neatly furnished in the old stile, the chair-bottoms, the curtains, and even the pictures, were of needle-work.</P>
<P>The floor, which was of old oak, glistered with a burnished lustre, and every article of the furniture had, from frequent friction, ac∣quired a shining polish. In one corner stood a tambour-frame, in another corner an apa∣ratus for painting—a grey parrot occupied a window on the right, a breeding-cage of Ca∣nary-birds occupied a window on the left, and on a large marble slab-table, which stood under a long old-fashioned pier-glass, two turtles billed and cooed in amorous dalliance—</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176"/>There were also two tabby-cats, their fur unsullied as ermine, purring by the sire-side; and a little French lap-dog, with his compa∣nion, big with pup, slumbered upon a cushion.</P>
<P>The lady of the mansion exhibited as evi∣dent marks of female industry as her furni∣ture. Every article of her dress, at least every thing that appeared, was ornamented with needle-work, and though in <HI>dishabille,</HI> all was neat, and pinned on with a systematic accuracy—</P>
<P>This lady was tall and slender, her waist scarce a span, her face forming an accute angle at the chin, her nose prominent, and her skin tight to her cheek-bones, as if braced out of those wrinkles, which a few trea∣cherous gray hairs peeping from under a black wig, informed the beholder it was intitled to—she had but <HI>one</HI> eye, but then that eye projected so far from out its socket, and had such a convenient power of turning on its swivel <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot"><P>Though there is no name mentioned here, yet we are clearly of opinion, that an information will lie <HI>in Banco Regis,</HI> provided any lady living in Windsor will swear she believes herself to be the person al∣luded to—WALL—S, <HI>Att.

<P>Some time ago, the above learned gentlemen, in argument at the bar, maintained, that <HI>swivels</HI> and <HI>guns</HI> were entirely different things.

<P>Having sketched out this virgin's person, (for she was unmarried, had preserved an un∣tainted fame, and was not one of those hypo∣crites who have no pretence to chastity them∣selves, but by their severity to the impure)— I must say something of her mind, with which I soon became intimately acquainted. She was a wit, a satyrist, a critic, and a writer,
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
with a tongue ever pretending service to her neighbours, but in its qualities contrary to that of the fox, which heals; whereas the tongue of Miss <HI>Verjuce</HI> operated upon a cha∣racter, as the medicine of a pretending quack, operates upon the body; and never parted it, till, as the devil left Job, the tor∣tured character became a sore all over—</P>
<P>With this damsel sat a military gentleman, not less than sixty, whose regimentals of scar∣let, faced with green velvet, exhibited the fashionable cut of twenty years past—His stature was tall, his shoulders broad, his ap∣pearance dignified, his eye penetrating, and his face, though furrowed by time, wore a smile of pleasantry, that shewed he had grown old with good humour, and could support age with a good grace. A verna∣cular broad pronunciation declared him an Irishman, and his attentive politeness soon convinced me he had held a commission of rank in a foreign service. He bore a deep scar upon his forehead, in testimony of his cou∣rage, and the <HI>croix de St. Louis</HI> pending
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
from his button-hole by a ribband, evinced his having received, at least, an honorary re∣ward from the prince under whose standard he had fought—</P>
<P>On this object the eye of Miss <HI>Verjuce</HI> kept continual play, which was returned by an assiduous attention to please on the part of the man of war.—She was his admirer, he pre∣tended to be her's, and she believed him, from the favourable opinion she entertained of her merits—O <HI>Vanity!</HI> thou art a fault of the first magnitude in woman!—the cause of her greatest misfortunes—even <HI>Poverty</HI> is not a greater enemy to her honour—and never had woman a greater share of vanity than the woman I have described—she was vain of her understanding, but that was excusable, her glass could not shew its deformity—she was vain of her person, that was astonishing, for the sight of it must have reproved and humbled her, every time she sat at her toilet</P>

could acquire <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>reputation</HI> under the government of my own country, I returned to her bosom; returned with as ardent affec∣tion, heaven knows! as ever lover returned with to the bosom of his mistress!—Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> for an instant <HI>relaxed</HI> her muscles— But while government precluded me from go∣ing to heaven by the road which the souls of my ancestors had travelled, I could not fight for that government with zeal, even if she had accepted my service.—Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> again <HI>braced</HI> up her muscles—and you thought purgatory, said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> the high road to heaven, and gave up your <HI>estate</HI> in <HI>this</HI> world, sooner than you would subscribe to the <HI>geography</HI> of the <HI>other</HI> world, as laid down by the law.—Do you not think it strange, Sir, continued this amiable virgin, turning her <HI>eye</HI> upon me, that a man bred to the <HI>sword,</HI> and who has been spreading <HI>desolation</HI> over the face of the earth, should have so <HI>tender</HI> a <HI>conscience?</HI>—</P>
<P>I would have answered the lady—but there was no stopping the tide of the Captain's
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
volubility; his face glowed scarlet—his eyes darted lightning—he rose from his chair, and throwing himself into the attitude of a <HI>Cicero,</HI> addressed Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI>—You are a woman, Madam—and do not understand the duty of a soldier, nor the honourable purposes of war. —The duty of a soldier, Madam, is to sup∣port justice, and do injury to no man—to maintain truth, and aid virtue—and let me tell you, Madam, that to repress the wild fury of lawless invaders, and by force to extirpate wickedness and oppression from the face of the earth, has never been account∣ed violence or spreading desolation in any country or language—Robbers may be sub∣dued by force or death, if other means fail. Those who invade private property, may be compelled to restitution at the bar of justice. But if independant states have injured us, to what bar shall we cite them? who shall con∣strain them to appear at our summons? or if they should appear, who shall oblige them to abide by our sentence—open force then must be the dernier resort; and who will be
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
base, or mean enough to say, that under such circumstances war is not just.</P>
<P>You are so eloquent and energetic in your eloquence, Captain, said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> that it is really a pity you are not in the house, to aid the phalanx of <HI>speaking</HI> admirals and ge∣nerals—</P>
<P>The Captain had spent many years in France, he took the compliment <HI>literally,</HI> bowed in return, and laying his hand upon his heart, swore he would prefer serving his country in the field—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> would have replied, but the Captain had not exhausted his oratory—</P>
<P>The enemies of Great-Britain and Ireland, vociferated the Captain, have in the present war acted with treachery, and should be pu∣nished —let every soldier, raising his hand as if to stimulate the ranks—let every soldier raise in himself a noble manly enthusiasm— <HI>you</HI> fight in the cause of virtue, justice, and freedom; no one is going to fight, said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> but the Captain was not to be in∣terrupted —he galloped on—animated by this
<PB N="182" REF="185"/>
divine principle, what wonders have not Bri∣tons performed, how have they risen terrors of the earth, the protectors of the oppressed, the avengers of justice, and scourge of ty∣rants —how have the sons of rapine sunk be∣fore them, confounded and overthrown— Witness ye <HI>Danube</HI> and <HI>Sombre,</HI> crimsoned with blood—let France, let Spain, Germany, and both the Indies bear witness.—What was it fired British kings and generals—Alfred— William—Henry—George —Marlborough Granby—Cumberland—Wolfe, and Ligo∣nier? —I will tell you, said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> it was the justice of their cause, and an un∣conquerable passion for liberty!—</P>
<P>This unexpected stroke of anticipation <HI>cut down</HI> the Captain—he suddenly fell back in his chair—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> could not bear to lose the ad∣vantage of her <HI>cut</HI>—she followed her blow— there was a loud <HI>explosion</HI> in your fire, Cap∣tain, said Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI>—but the charge was <HI>government powder</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="186"/>I felt for the Captain, so changed the sub∣ject —There are but few of our countrymen now, said I, in foreign service—I know but of two, answered the Captain—<HI>O'Ricly,</HI> who is in the service of <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> who is in the service of <HI>France</HI>—</P>
<P>Do you mean the Sieur <HI>O'Ricly,</HI> said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> who went ambassador from <HI>Madrid</HI> to <HI>Paris?</HI>—I do, Madam, answered the Cap∣tain; and Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> who was dispatch∣ed from <HI>Paris,</HI> to negociate with the Queen of <HI>Portugal</HI> on the armed neutrality—</P>
<P>There were accounts of those negotiations, I believe, said <HI>Maria,</HI> published in the prints —True, Madam, said the Captain, I was present at <HI>O'Riely</HI>'s interview with the French king, and went with <HI>O'Dunn</HI> into Portugal, from whence I came to London.—It was I wrote and sent the accounts to the <HI>Public Ledger,</HI> under the head, <HI>Extract of a Letter from Paris</HI>: I have both <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">It is very probable, this extract of a letter from Paris, is as authentic as most extracts from fo∣reign letters are—the majority of which are written in London.</NOTE> about me,

<HEAD>THE SIEUR O'RIELY'S NEGOTIATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE most <HI>extraordinary</HI> intelligence that ever was published within the walls of Paris, or ever set the spirits of Frenchmen upon the wing, has been published within these few days.</P>
<P>The victories of Edward and Henry of England, did not astonish the French nation so much, nor did the conquests of Lewis the XIVth, give the French people half the satisfaction, as they received from the cap∣ture of the English merchant-men. It was as novel as it was unexpected.</P>
<P>Half the people in France will be ruined by the expence of rejoicings—every house was
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
open, all the bells were ringing—men, women, and children, of all denominations, trades, and professions, danc'd, caper'd, jigg'd it, and skip'd about with the agility of Benivento's devils. —What with fire-works and illuminations, bon-fires and transparent paintings, rockets, squibs, and crackers, discharges from the artillery, <HI>feus de joye</HI> from the small arms, and huzzaing from the mob, not only the city of Paris, but the whole country round, looked and sounded like hell itself.—All was fire and clatter—<HI>te Deums</HI> in every church!—</P>
<P>The court was met upon the occasion of the glad tidings, when a <HI>Grandee of Spain,</HI> whiskered up to the eye-brows—gloved up to the elbows—cuffed up to the arms, booted up to the hips, with a coat which fell short of his hams, a waistcoat that reached to his knees, and spurred upon each heel like a game-cock, arrived express from Madrid, with a letter congratulatory from his most <HI>Catholic</HI> Majesty.—</P>
<P>The Grandee wore a thundering black perriwig, bushy at the sides, with a ramillie
<PB N="187" REF="190"/>
tail down to his crupper, and had belted round his waist a basket toledo, in the hilt of which was deposited his handkerchief.—</P>
<P>The Grandee of Spain was announced to the court, by the Gentleman Usher, as the <HI>Sieur O'Riely.</HI>—The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> entered the instant his name was announced, the most <HI>Christian</HI> King having just time to take his throne—the Queen seating herself by him.— The most Christian King arose to receive the <HI>Sieur</HI>—the Queen turned to her favourite maid of honour <HI>Lucetta.</HI>—</P>
<P>This Grandee must be <HI>Irish,</HI> observed the Queen, by the great O' he carries before his name. It is true, said <HI>Lucetta,</HI> for your Majesty may remember most of the brigade officers who are returned to <HI>Ireland,</HI> had great O' before their names <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Since the laws against papists have been relaxed in Ireland, several gentlemen who were in foreign services, have returned to their native country.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I remember it well, answered the Queen, blushing.—</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="191"/>Her Majesty laying the back of her right hand convexed into the palm of her left, which she had concaved for the purpose, and resting her elbows upon her hips, with great ease dropped both hands upon—the Queen's hands fell just over that spot, where, in the picture of Venus, the golden clasp unites the argent zone of the Goddess.—The Queen courtesying to the ground, with the most amiable humility, while her eyes darted beams more penetrating than the rays of Apollo— her hands still keeping their position—said to the Sieur <HI>O'Riely—"Noble Sir, your are welcome to these parts."</HI>—</P>
<P>The whole court was astonished at her Majesty's condescension.—</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> was overwhelmed with her goodness, even to confusion.—</P>
<P>Bowing to the ground with profound re∣spect, and drawing back his right leg, he thurst his spur into that part of the Gentle∣man-usher's ancle where the articulation unites the leg to the foot.—The electrified Gentleman-usher sprung from the ground
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
with a <HI>sacra Dieu!</HI> and forgetting the presence he was in, laid his hand upon his sword. The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> turning round his head, looked the Gentleman-usher full in the face, and curling up his mustachios over his nos∣trils, muttered something in a language nei∣ther English, Irish, French, nor Spanish— it partook of each language—"he grinned horribly a ghastly smile."—The Gentleman-usher felt the full force of the Gorgon grin, he stood petrified—The whole court laughed. —The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> took a pinch of snuff— he took it from his coat-pocket, where he always kept it loose.</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> falling upon his left knee, rivetted his eyes upon the eyes of the Queen of France.—I have got it here, said <HI>O'Riely,</HI> thursting his hand into his breeches pockets—I have got that here, to present to your Majesty, the like of which was never seen in France, in Spain, nor in any other country on the continent.—The Queen of France, <HI>Lucetta</HI> her favourite, the maids of honour, and all the other ladies of the court,
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
smiled, while their eyes followed the hand of the <HI>Sieur</HI> into his breeches-pocket—a thou∣sand ideas struck their imagination.—</P>
<P>I have it here, exclaimed the <HI>Sieur,</HI> with an exulting voice, as he drew from his breeches pocket <HI>a long roll.</HI>—It was a roll of parchment, on which was written "a list of the <HI>English merchantmen</HI> taken by the fleets of France and Spain."</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> was right—France nor Spain, nor no country in the universe ever before saw such a sight.</P>
<P>The French King had read about one quarter of the list, when a nobleman rushed in, out of breath—Eagerness and astonish∣ment were in his countenance.—The <HI>Belle Poule,</HI> said the nobleman, is taken!—Eng∣land must become bankrupt! exclaimed the French King.—The captain, officers, and one half of the seamen, said the nobleman, are killed.—Lord have mercy on their souls! ejaculated the French King—but <HI>we have taken the English convoy.</HI>—Amen, added a bishop, nodding half a sleep in a chair—<HI>we
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
have taken the English convoy.</HI>—Let masses be said for the killed, said the Queen—<HI>we have taken the English convoy</HI>—not till thanksgiving is sung for the victory, said Monsieur <HI>Sartine —we have taken the English convoy.—</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Belle Poule,</HI> the captain, the officers, and the seamen, were immediately forgotten by the court of France—<HI>they had taken the English convoy.</HI></P>
<P>The French King had read through half the list, when another nobleman came in.— The Duke <HI>d'Artois</HI> is gone, said the noble∣man, with a melancholy voice.—Then we have lost the patron of fashion, said the Gen∣tlemen-usher, looking down upon his enor∣mous buckles, with a sigh.—You must con∣ceal the Duke's death, said the French King, till the rejoicings are over—<HI>we have taken the English convoy.</HI>—If half the princes of the blood were dead, I would not mourn, nor wear mourning, this month—<HI>for we have taken the English convoy.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Vive le Roi!</HI> exclaimed the nobleman, but alas! letting his voice fall into a sorrowful
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>
<HI>piano,</HI> it is the <HI>Artois ship of war,</HI> carrying sixty-four guns and seven hundred men, that is gone.—Good heaven, said the Queen, the <HI>Artois</HI> was commanded by an <HI>Irishman!</HI> and was taken by an <HI>Irishman,</HI> an't please your Majesty, answered the nobleman <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">The Artois was commanded by the Count <HI>d'Clonard,</HI> and taken by Captain <HI>Mac Bride.</HI></NOTE>—When <HI>Greek</HI> meets <HI>Greek,</HI> then comes the tug of war! said <HI>O'Riely.</HI></P>
<P>These Irishmen, <HI>Lucetta,</HI> whispered the Queen of France, are always <HI>standing</HI> in our way—that is our own fault, an't please your Majesty, answered <HI>Lucetta.</HI></P>
<P>Was their force equal? interrogated the French King.—Pretty equal, answered the nobleman.—By no means, said <HI>O'Riely,</HI> turning to an Irish officer who stood behind him—<HI>Clonard</HI> fought against his king and country—disloyalty weighed him down, and the reproach of being a parracide, weakened his heart.—Merciful heaven! that zeal should so long have blinded England and my

<P>Big tears stood in the eye of the Sieur <HI>O'Riely,</HI> for an instant—they rolled down the surrows of his sun-burnt cheek—he took his handkerchief, from the hilt of his sword, to wipe those tears away, which his country∣man perceiving, he clasped the veteran in his arms, and received the tears upon his faith∣ful bosom.—</P>
<P>Here ended the Letter from Paris.—<HI>Maria</HI> had dropped a sympathetic tear with <HI>O'Riely</HI>— Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> had swelled, but the fountain of humanity was dried within—not a tear fell.—You have taken no small pains, Cap∣tain, said Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> to blazon the virtue and courage of your own countrymen, attend to the next letter, said the Captain, and you shall acknowledge I have not been partial.— So saying, the Captain put another paper in my hand, and I read—</P>

<HEAD>O'RIELY AND SARTINE.</HEAD>
<P>THE court having broken up, Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI> conducted the Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> from the royal palace to his own house.—</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, and the attendants ordered to retire, <HI>Sartine</HI> filled a rummer glass with Burgundy, and taking the <HI>Sieur</HI> by the hand—you Islanders, said <HI>Sartine,</HI> drink deep—come, you must fill to my toast—I am going to give <HI>the land we live in.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sieur</HI> seizing the decanter in his right hand, and a rummer glass in his left, turned up his eyes to heaven, with a look of ardent zeal, approaching devotion—he heaved a heavy sigh from the bottom of his deep chest, expressive of his feeling, and pouring the libation of Burgundy into his rummer, till it overflowed the brim, and rising from his chair, his eye still turned up to heaven, he
<PB N="195" REF="198"/>
articulated in an expression of grief, mingled with pleasure—<HI>The British dominions.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>Sartine</HI> smiled, at what he supposed a mis∣take of his guest.—</P>
<P>You are an <HI>Irishman,</HI> said <HI>Sartine,</HI> and have privilege to fall into errors without giv∣ing offence.—I excuse you, my friend, but I meant by my toast, the dominions of the <HI>grand monarque.</HI></P>
<P>Then, answered <HI>O'Riely,</HI> you should have said—the land we <HI>breathe</HI> in—there is no <HI>living</HI> any where, but under a free government.— I have considered myself as dying of a con∣sumption ever since I left my native climate, so <HI>here she goes!</HI> and pouring more wine upon the liquor which already overflowed his rum∣mer —<HI>here she goes!</HI> repeated <HI>O'Riely,</HI> with an <HI>oath.</HI>—</P>
<P>It is a <HI>bumper toast,</HI> said <HI>Sartine,</HI> and should have preceded all others, filling at the same time the rummer he had emptied, to the dominions of the <HI>grand monarque.</HI>—It is a bumper toast, by heaven! said <HI>O'Riely,</HI> and the world must give way to her—only <HI>half</HI> of
<PB N="196" REF="199"/>
the world, said <HI>Sartine.</HI>—She is the mother of the islands, continued <HI>O'Riely</HI>—she is the sovereign mistress of the sea.—I love her as I love the blood of my heart—my toast is <HI>Old England.</HI>—</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI> was struck dumb—he sipped part of his Burgundy.—</P>
<P>This <HI>victory</HI> of ours, said <HI>Sartine,</HI> recover∣ing from his surprize, as <HI>O'Riely</HI> recovered from his agitation, this victory of ours is glorious! What victory, enquired his guest? Have we not taken the <HI>English convoy?</HI> said <HI>Sartine.</HI>—We may say with <HI>Caesar, Veni! vidi! vici!</HI> Yes, you may say that, said <HI>O'Riely,</HI> you came! you saw! you conquer'd! but I cannot see much honour in the affair, nor much courage, nor any great national ad∣vantage. —The devil a sword was drawn— nor the devil a gun was fired; and when the cargoes are divided between France and Spain, where will be the advantage?—</P>
<P>Let me tell you, Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> this glorious victory, gained without fighting or bloodshed, will cost France and Spain more

ships, more men, more money, and more re∣putation, than a thousand times the value of the ships they have taken.—</P>
<P>Englishmen are as delicate of the character of their <HI>courage,</HI> as English women are of the reputation of their <HI>chastity.</HI>—</P>
<P>Take my word for it, Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> a short time will shew you same of those laconic English Gazette-epistles, that say, "the enemies ships are all taken, sunk, burned, and destroyed, as per margin."—</P>
<P>The times are altered, said <HI>Sartine.</HI>—I grant such accounts have formerly appeared, but in our late engagements with the English, we have fought like devils incarnate.</P>
<P>You have done wonders no doubt, an∣swered the <HI>Hibernian</HI>; but if your men have fought like <HI>devils,</HI> how must these men have fought, who cut your devils to pieces—they must have fought like <HI>angels</HI> at least.—The courage of the <HI>English</HI> is natural, it is in∣herent to the soil—their dogs, their horses, their game cocks, are constitutionally brave;

<HEAD>O'RIELY AT THE DRAWING-ROOM. THE RUMP OF BEEF.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>O'Riely</HI> arrived at the drawing-room, he was joined by his country∣man in the French service—description is in∣adequate, said <HI>O'Riely</HI>'s countryman, the tongue of man cannot communicate a proper idea of the vanity, the pride, the presumption of this volatile nation—from the meanest pea∣sant up to the grand <HI>monarque,</HI> they are jig∣ging it over the whole country—</P>
<P>The court is in an uproar—all the foreign ministers, all the nobles, and all the wives, sons and daughters of the nobles and foreign ministers, have been invited to partake of the English and Irish beef taken on board the Quebec fleet—a large <HI>rump</HI> has been sent to
<PB N="200" REF="203"/>
Paris as a specimen; this <HI>rump</HI> was intended for the king's table, but not a pot in his majesty's kitchen was large enough to boil it —The chief cook has made his fortune by shewing it at a <HI>dernier</HI> per head. There ne∣ver was such a <HI>rump</HI> seen in France—</P>
<P>The magnitude of this <HI>rump</HI> had set all the court ladies of France calculating—they thought of nothing but the <HI>rump</HI>—the <HI>rump</HI> was still uppermost in their thoughts, and at their tongues ends.—The queen of France intending to enquire after the king's <HI>health,</HI> enquired after his majesty's <HI>rump—Lucetta</HI> missed her little lap-dog—has any one seen it, said <HI>Lucetta,</HI> there never was so pretty a thing—seen what? asked Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> my little <HI>rump</HI> answered <HI>Lucetta</HI>—a bee stung one of the maids of honour on the <HI>cheek</HI>— I am stung!—I am stung!—roared the maid of honour—where!—where? enquired the king's physician—here, here, here on my <HI>rump,</HI> said the maid of honour—then I cannot extract the sting in this place, replied the physician—</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204"/>The magnitude of this <HI>rump</HI> had set all the court ladies of France calculating—the height of the great statue of Jupiter, was calculated from his thumb, as bearing a proportion to its other parts. The stature of the antidelu∣vian giants was calculated from their hip-bones found in Sicily, and the size of the deer, formerly in Ireland, has been calcu∣lated from the dimensions of their horns found in the bogs—The French ladies had better materials for calculating, than a <HI>thumb,</HI> a <HI>hip-bone,</HI> or a deer's <HI>antler</HI>—They calcu∣lated from the <HI>rump</HI>—</P>
<P>An English ox, said <HI>Lucetta,</HI> has, I suppose, a <HI>rump</HI> as large again as an Englishman—and so by a simple rule of division, she measured the limbs of the English prisoners expected at Paris—<HI>Lucetta</HI> first measured their <HI>rumps</HI> in her imagination, and thereby <HI>hangs a tail</HI>— <HI>Lucetta</HI> whispered in the Queen's ear when she had formed her calulation—you are right, said the Queen to <HI>Lucetta,</HI> that must be the <HI>length,</HI> for that is just <HI>half</HI> the length of an English <HI>oxe's horn</HI>—we have no such <HI>horns</HI> in

<P>NEVER was drawing-room in Paris so crowded as this drawing-room—all or∣ders of people were admitted, tag, rag, and bob-tail, poured in; and as they poured in, they poured out their congratulations to the French King on capturing the Quebec fleet —<HI>Vive le Roi!</HI> was the general cry—</P>
<P>There was not half so much rejoicing in England last war, when not only Quebec itself, but all Canada was taken from France by the British arms—</P>
<P>I always give my opinion openly, when it is demanded, said the Sieur <HI>O'Riely,</HI> bowing
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>
respectfully, and answering the King—I was born in a land of liberty, and sucked in free∣dom with the first respirations of life. Your majesty commands my opinion, you shall have an honest one—</P>
<P>The English have lost their Quebec fleet, a heavy loss to them no doubt, but no ac∣quisition of glory to France or to Spain, they had no convoy to fight for them—not a gun fired—not a sword drawn—</P>
<P>Should the grand fleets of each nation meet, then there will be fighting worth speaking of. These English are a people who will march up as cool to the mouth of a charged canon, as they march up to their bed—</P>
<P>To their bed, said <HI>Lucetta</HI> to herself— march up <HI>coolly</HI> to their bed!—the Sieur must be speaking of <HI>batchelors,</HI> I suppose, whisper∣ed <HI>Lucetta</HI> to the Queen—Heaven preserve me from a husband who would march <HI>coolly</HI> to bed—</P>
<P>How did they behave against Caesar, against the Danes—How at Cressy—at

<P>And I swear by my <HI>bishoprick,</HI> continued the reverend father—and there is not a better bishoprick in France, had but one company of <HI>Amazons</HI> been in the pay of France that day, the <HI>unbreeched</HI> English would never have carried a <HI>standard</HI> from the field—</P>
<P>It was a <HI>dirty</HI> affair, said the King—to <HI>France,</HI> said <HI>O'Riely</HI>—but why did you not open the <HI>nunneries,</HI> the <HI>nuns</HI> would have done the business as effectually as the Amazons; confinement gives ferocity to passion—the

<P>You are mistaken, replied the bishop, the holy mother-church takes special care, that all women under tuition of its <HI>members</HI> shall be properly <HI>disciplined.</HI> Though nunneries are <HI>hot-beds,</HI> yet the <HI>nuns</HI> who may be said to <HI>vegetate</HI> in these beds, are <HI>cool</HI> as <HI>cucum∣bers</HI>—</P>
<P>As I am a Christian, ruminated <HI>Lucetta</HI> to herself—had I known that <HI>nuns</HI> led such chaste and holy lives—I should have taken the veil long since—I should have flourished in one of these <HI>hot-beds</HI> like a <HI>sensitive plant</HI>—</P>
<P>The Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI> went on—</P>
<P>Let us, continued the Sieur, look to more modern times. The astonishing victories of Marlborough, which exceed any victories an∣tiquity can boast—to these succeed Dettin∣gen —Minden—hold said Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> interrupting the <HI>Sieur,</HI> you have forgotten or
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
slipped over Fountenoy, where the English run—</P>
<P>Not so, by heaven! said <HI>O'Riely,</HI> stretch∣ing forth his hand, and rolling an enthu∣siastic eye, I have not forgotten Fountenoy— nor the famous battle of the <HI>Spurs,</HI> where the French cavalry galloped off in whole squadrons—the English run at Fountenoy! yes, they run up to the muzzles of your mus∣quets, while you were intrenched chin-deep in earth, and mowing down whole columns from your masked batteries—but notwith∣standing the whole power of France, your <HI>gen d'arms,</HI> and your select infantry, the Eng∣lish would never have stopped running, till they had run into your trenches, and forced you to run out, but for your auxiliaries— they never stood till the Irish brigades ap∣peared before them, and then they stood; shocked to see the subjects of their own cli∣mate, the children of their own constitution standing armed, to oppose them in the field— the brigades changed the face of the battle, they fought for a point of honour, and would
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
not flinch. The English had the same point of honour to maintain, and each fought, with∣out losing an inch of ground, till the slaughter on both sides made it necessary for each side to retreat—the French looking on—</P>
<P>After this, good Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> con∣tinued <HI>O'Riely,</HI> will you pretend to say, that at Fountenoy, even England retreated before France —</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI> stood dumb—</P>
<P>This too was the day when the late glorious immortal Cumberland, rebellion's curse and freedom's friend, exclaimed against the wretch∣ed policy of his country, which forced so many of her subjects to fight against her, for the wretched pay, and precarious sustenance of France—</P>
<P>O! may the hero ever live the blessing and the honour of his country!—</P>
<P>The whole court laughed at the Sieur <HI>O'Riley</HI>'s blunder—they took it for an error of his <HI>head,</HI> whereas it was an overflowing of his <HI>heart</HI>—he was grateful to Cumberland for his
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
opinion <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">When the Duke of Cumberland saw the stand made by the Irish brigades, he cursed with great bitterness the policy which had forced them into a foreign service. There was a regiment of Irish horse in the service of England that day, commanded by Lord Ligonier, which stood till almost cut to pieces—</NOTE>—the bishop took him up upon it —the Duke of Cumberland, said the bishop, has been dead some years—we have not heard of his resurrection—</P>
<P><HI>O'Riely</HI> gave a heavy sigh, and with a smile of ineffable contempt, retorted upon the holy father—not one of all the saints, said <HI>O'Riley,</HI> that ever Monkish superstition ca∣nonized in your rubrick, lives in such glory as the hero—Cumberland the brave, the ge∣nerous and good, <HI>lives</HI> in the hearts of a free people, and will live in their hearts, till me∣mory is no more—and history is obliterated —which of the commanders, of your army of martyrs, can you say so much—</P>
<P>The French King, mortified at the spirit and manner in which the brave old Hibernian had delivered his sentiments, left the draw∣ing-room
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
in disgust—the bishop followed his majesty, gnawing his under lip, he felt for the army of martyrs—and Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI> skipped after with remarkable agility, Mon∣sieur <HI>Sartine</HI> felt for himself—</P>
<P>The Queen remained behind, which <HI>O'Riely</HI> perceiving, stepped in between her majesty and the gentleman usher, who instantly step∣ped aside, and offering his hand, with an ob∣sequious bow, her majesty accepted it with an ineffable smile of good humour and conde∣scension —Every courtier's heart grew black with envy—</P>
<P><HI>Lucetta</HI> and the maids of honour brought up the rear, with their eyes fixed upon <HI>O'Riely</HI>'s back, he is at least half the size of an ox, said <HI>Lucetta</HI>—what a <HI>rump,</HI> said the maids of honour—and what a <HI>Ramillie-tail,</HI> said <HI>Lu∣cetta</HI> —the maids of honour repeated the ob∣servation, it flew into the anti-chamber, where it was echoed by the court ladies—the other attendants re-echoed it in the upper stories—it got down stairs, and returned up
<PB N="211" REF="214"/>
stairs verberated and re-verberated, from room to room, from the garret to the coal-hole.</P>
<P>Having finished the Sieur <HI>O'Riely</HI>'s inter∣view with their French majesties, and return∣ed the paper to the Captain, Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> opened her mouth, a mouth which never opened, but like Pandora's-box, it emitted a collection of evils—Happily for the Captain in the very instant she was going to give a full discharge of acrimonious sarcasm, the servant brought in a note, which she inform∣ed us, required her immediate attendance on a neighbouring lady who was seized with labour—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> though a <HI>virgin,</HI> had the ex∣perience of an <HI>acoucheur</HI>; she had read anatomy, and was often called in to assist, being re∣markable for her <HI>philosophical</HI> conduct, which enabled her to stand <HI>unmoved,</HI> when even the midwife has been found so <HI>weak-hearted,</HI> as to leave her patient to nature—But if Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> did not possess humanity, she pos∣sessed the affectation of humanity in the fullest extent; for as her virtue consisted in her se∣verity
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
upon the vicious, so her humanity consisted in a severe abuse upon the unchari∣table —She was a theorist in both, but had never entered into the practice of either— Not but Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> had passions—but she had never been led into temptation—</P>
<P>Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> was punctual to every call of every sick or unfortunate acquaintance, who stood in need of <HI>no</HI> pecuniary assistance, no lady could mourn with a more deplorable countenance, or sought the house of sorrow with more sedulity than Miss <HI>Verjuice,</HI> if verbal consolation only was required—yet such was the tenderness of her feelings, that if <HI>want</HI> attended sickness or misfortune, she could not bear to look upon accumulated distress, and therefore the poor man's door she was never known to enter—</P>
<P>Punctual in attending church, and regu∣lar in paying the poor-rates, it might be said that she was religious and bountiful <HI>according to law.</HI> She practised all the externals of morality, without morals, and
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
performed the rituals of devotions, without piety <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">I have been particular in describing this <HI>virgin</HI> and her attributes, as she will hereafter cut a very conspicuous figure in these excursions.

<P>Miss Verjuice, notwithstanding an affec∣tation of hurry, entered into a dissertation upon the necessity of assisting our fellow-creature in distress; but <HI>Maria</HI> observing, that perhaps her friend might be impatient to see her—she made an apology, I returned to the parlour with <HI>Maria,</HI> attended by the Captain, and soon after saw Miss <HI>Verjuice</HI> sally forth, equipt in her night-dress—</P>
<P>The Captain proposed a walk, to which proposal Maria and I acquiescing, we pro∣ceeded to the bank of the Thames, and find∣ing

<HEAD>THE BIRD'S NEST.</HEAD>
<P>A THRUSH sat perched upon the spray of an old thorn, he kept turning and look∣ing to every quarter, with evident anxious expectation; but being soon joined by his mate, who bore food in her mouth, his joy became conspicuous as his anxiety had been, and he expressed it to his companion in a thousand endearing salutations and offices of love—the hen popped into the thicket to feed her young, while the cock turning up his head towards heaven, in grateful thanks to his Creator, for the providential sustenance of his little family, poured forth the joyful thanks of his heart in melodious song—</P>
<P>But happiness is not the lot of mortal be∣ings, from the most insignificant insect up to the great lord of the creation, man, every animal has its misfortunes—its miseries—all are the sports of contingencies—</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="219"/>Two boys stole along the thicket—the poor thrush upon the spray, instantly stopt his me∣lody —he boys had discovered his nest, and before I could prevent the depredation, for I arose for the purpose, had torn it from the thicket with its infant inhabitants. The hen had escaped, and joined the mate—the boys carried off their prey, the old birds call∣ing in notes of distress—the boys disappeared, hope disappeared with them—the unhappy pa∣rents sat silent close to each other for a few mi∣nutes, when, as if urged by a mutual despair, they took wing together, and flew from the scene of their wretchedness—</P>
<P>There is something, said the Captain, truly distressing, in the exhibition of domestic woe, just presented to us—and should I detect a son of mine in the commission of such a rob∣bery, as the two little rascals have committed, I would punish them as severely as for rob∣bing the church—</P>
<P>Why, in truth, said Maria, it is a species of sacrilege—children should be taught to abhor it, to impress the precepts of humanity
<PB N="217" REF="220"/>
upon the minds of infants is the first, the most essential duty of parents—it prepares the heart for all the tender offices of life, and opens the soul to receive the lights of mora∣lity and religion—</P>
<P>I must pay this tribute to your sentiment, said the Captain, seizing <HI>Maria</HI>'s hand—pres∣sing it to his breast—he raised it to his lips, and kissed it—but with such chastity of de∣votion, as the professed religious kiss the shrines of their patron saints.—A tear had fallen from his eye upon <HI>Maria</HI>'s hand, she would have wiped it away with her handker∣chief, but while viewing it with admiration, her heart bleeding with sympathy, a beam darted from the evening-sun, and exhaled the tear to the upper heaven, where it is now preserved upon the altar of <HI>grace,</HI> an evidence of human benignity.</P>
<P>It is our duty, said the Captain, to use all animals with mercy—they have life, they have sense, they have gratitude—those of a domestic nature, are most of them endowed with affection and tenderness to their protec∣tors,
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>
while others possess properties, which make us the most beneficial returns—we owe justice to men, but grace and goodness to brutes—</P>
<P>But, said I, adverting to the plunder of the poor thrush, there is a happiness peculiar to subordinate animals of every species, their parental tenderness is but temporary, and their grief on losing their offspring, though it may be severe while it lasts, lasts but a short time; whereas with the human species, such misfortunes produce permanent grief—often terminate in death—</P>

<HEAD>SLAVE TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>MERCIFUL heaven! exclaimed the Captain—when we reflect upon the plunder of the human species, carried on by nations calling themselves christian, profes∣sing the divine maxim "do as you would be done by," boasting the benign principles of humanity, and enlightened by the sublime rays of holy revelation, it sinks us, in my opinion, infinitely below the most ferocious beasts of prey, for none of these live by the slaughter and calamities of their own kind.—</P>
<P>I perceive, said I, you are execrating the conduct of Europeans to the unhappy chil∣dren of Africa.—I have often reflected upon our cruelty to those people; first, in carrying them from their native country, and then exercising upon them every cruelty that can
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>
debase human nature, or render life misera∣ble.—</P>
<P>There is but one way of accounting for this cruelty, said Maria, and <HI>Sterne</HI> has hit upon it, "the poor <HI>Negroes</HI> have no one to stand up for them."—</P>
<P>They are sacrifices to COMMERCE, said I—</P>
<P>You mean to AVARICE, said the Captain— COMMERCE is a mild deity, and never re∣quires human victims to bleed upon her altar.</P>
<P>—The fruits of industry and the fruits of the earth are her offerings. Commerce is a cure for the most destructive prejudices; where we find agreeable manners, there com∣merce flourishes; and wherever there is com∣merce, there we meet agreeable manners.— So says Montesquieu.—</P>
<P>Commercical laws, said I, arguing from the same author, improve manners, but they improve manners from the same reason they destroy them—they corrupt the purest morals, polish and refine the most barbarous. The spirit of trade produces in the mind of man a certain sense of exact justice, but does it
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
not produce sanguinary laws and rage of avarice, that overleaps all bound of justice, and tramples upon humanity. The total de∣privation of trade produces robbery—but is not hospitality most rare in trading countries, and is it not found in perfection among nations of vagabonds? Among the ancient Germans, to shut a door against a stranger, would be considered as sacrilege.—</P>
<P>I shall not take upon me, said Maria, to determine how far such nations may merit the opprobrious term you have given them, but I should rather live and die among such a people, than among the most refined; and I think this hospitality, which must neces∣sarily include in it an assiduity to please, is a convincing proof of the excellency of the human heart in a simple state.—What have we got by our boasted improvements and frivilous politeness, but the loss of manly firmness and independence <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">I could write a very long note upon this.—<BIBL>ED. O—S—W.</BIBL></NOTE>.—</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="225"/>The Captain looked at Maria with astonish∣ment, and seizing her hand with a degree of rapture, exclaimed, you are right—you are right, my girl! Avarice, sensuality, and every species of meanness, have succeeded to gene∣rosity and honour; and faction and servitude, with bellowing on one side, and adulation on the other, are storming and undermining the asylum of liberty—almost every man wears the mask of hypocrisy—the noble frankness which marked the character of Englishmen, has dwindled into an affectation of sentiment; and in assuming susceptibility of too refined feelings, from feeling like men, we have adopted the manners of women.—Even phi∣losophy participates the refinement of mo∣dern manners; she forgets her chaste and simple character—she forgets that she once inhabited the lonely cot of Socrates, and shared the frugal fare of Epaminondas.— Then your legislators and generals—Shew me a modern senator or commander, who will descend from the seat of magistracy or
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>
car of triumph, and cultivate the land which his voice enacted laws to rule, or which he defended with his blood—</P>
<P>But to advert to the subject we were on, continued the Captain, every man who pos∣sesses humanity, can vindicate the rights of humanity in his own breast; but few men, who feel the force of these rights, have abi∣lity to defend them.—When a benevolent mind contemplates the ravages, with which avarice has depopulated whole regions of the earth, the soul shudders with horror—But when we see the unhappy NEGRO, seduced by the wiles of European dissimulation, or dragged by trea∣chery and force, from his native liberty, re∣lations, friends—perhaps the partner of his heart, and pledges of his love—then indeed the soul revolts and execrates the <HI>villain,</HI> and the infamous <HI>policy</HI> which <HI>protects</HI> the vil∣lain, who, to indulge his <HI>avarice,</HI> by pro∣viding for the sensuality of others, tramples upon natural rights, and forces into the vile
<PB N="224" REF="227"/>
regions of servitude, men born free as him∣self <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">It is really astonishing, that in the dependencies of Great-Britain, <HI>slavery</HI> should be permitted. The court of <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> in the celebrated <HI>negro cause,</HI> laid it down, as a <HI>principle</HI> of the English constitution, that slavery could not exist in this coun∣try, and that the instant a <HI>negro</HI> set his foot on shore, he was free. Surely the <HI>principles</HI> of the consti∣tution are immutable, and rule in all the dependen∣cies of Great-Britain, though the <HI>local</HI> laws do not, and therefore <HI>slavery</HI> cannot constitutionally exist in the dependencies.<BIBL>—F—H—R—VE.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have served in South America, continued the Captain—I have conversed with the slaves, and have sound among them men as capable of generous sentiment, and of as noble soul, as ever distinguished the character of a white —Good heavens! my heart sinks, when re∣collection presents to my imagination, the misery of these unfortunate fellow-creatures, to whom death alone can give enfranchise∣ment!—</P>
<P>Here the Captain stopped—he was too full to proceed—</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="228"/>As we are convinced, said <HI>Maria,</HI> from our own feelings, that our hearts naturally in∣cline us to relieve misery, and our reason approves it as right—when we consider that providence has infused humanity into our breasts, and has taught us to look to him as an example of mercy; it is astonishing, that pity, and the divine pleasure which re∣sults from doing good, should be so far exter∣minated from mankind.</P>
<P>Cruelties, said the Captain, which no tongue can describe, which no heart can conceive, but from the evidence of the eyes, are inflicted upon <HI>negroes.</HI> The American and West-Indian news∣papers, may give a slight idea of the deplor∣able situation of these unhappy creatures. In these papers, they are advertised as <HI>negro fel∣lows,</HI> or <HI>negro wenches</HI>—often described as bearing their tyrannic master's <HI>brand</HI> upon their <HI>cheek</HI>—having a <HI>padlocked yoke</HI> about their <HI>neck,</HI> or carrying the marks of merciless <HI>stripes</HI> upon their <HI>skin</HI>—I have seen them roused by the <HI>lash</HI> to their labour—drove into stalls in herds like brutes, and fed worse than those

<P>Pray, said <HI>Maria,</HI> addressing the Captain, are there any <HI>clergymen</HI> in those countries—</P>
<P>Every parish has its <HI>pastor,</HI> answered the Captain, and every <HI>pastor</HI> is a <HI>planter,</HI> and keeps unbaptized slaves—</P>
<P>Lord have mercy upon their souls! said Maria—</P>
<P>On whose souls? asked the Captain—</P>

<P><PB N="227" REF="234"/>The Captain would have proceeded, but perceiving Maria was in tears, he immediately stopt <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">He would have added, no doubt, that at the death of a planter the <HI>negroes</HI> are sold by auction, fathers separated from their children and their wives —that a <HI>white man</HI> may beat a <HI>black man</HI> with im∣punity, or debauch his wife or daughter—that he may <HI>murder</HI> him, upon paying his <HI>value, and</HI> that it is <HI>death</HI> for a black to strike a <HI>white</HI>—and so it should be—<BIBL>A PLANTER.</BIBL></NOTE>—He had a soul, brave as Achilles —had a heart melting as infant tenderness—</P>

<P>IF her majesty of Portugal could be pre∣vailed upon to join the armed neutrality, said the grand monarque, England must sub∣mit —her flag would no longer proudly fly, with usurped authority upon the narrow seas —the thunder of her cannon would no longer, with sovereign arrogance, command the ships of other independent states to lower their top-sails —What is to be done, <HI>Sartine?</HI>—</P>
<P>Nothing can be done, answered Monsieur <HI>Sartine,</HI> our most able and subtil negotiators have failed in their negotiations with the Queen of Portugal—</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="236"/>Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> who had been employed last war, as plenipotentiary to the court of Lisbon, was standing at the French King's elbow.</P>
<P>Our most able and subtle negotiators have failed, repeated Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI>—</P>
<P>They were Frenchmen, said Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> to himself—</P>
<P>The Queen of Portugal is as impenetrable as flint, said Monsieur <HI>Sartine</HI>—</P>
<P>To French negotiators, said Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> to himself—</P>
<P>You have been in Portugal, <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> said the French King—with a wink, which im∣plied, "you have seen <HI>Pharsalia</HI>;" but <HI>mum</HI>—what think you of the Queen, is she that soul of marble, <HI>Sartine</HI> represents her? —Is there no getting at her heart?</P>
<P>She is a woman, may it please your ma∣jesty, answered <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> and I know but of one way by which her heart can be approach∣ed—</P>
<P>The Count has been a man of gallantry in his time, observed the French Queen—no

<HEAD>O'DUNN'S ARRIVAL AT LISBON.</HEAD>
<P>SOON as the Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> arrived at Lisbon, he dispatched his secretary to court—the Lady in waiting informed the Queen of Portugal—the Count was desired to attend in the anti-chamber—he was an∣nounced —he appeared, and the instant he appeared, every woman in the room ejacu∣lated the first letter of his name with a note of admiration annexed—O! O! O! O! O! went round the room—O! was the only sound for two minutes—</P>
<P>The Ladies of the court dissected Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> as Ladies of the court always dis∣sect strangers on their first appearance—one praised his legs, another praised his shoulders —a third praised his eyes—but the old Dut∣chess
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
of B—was actually smitten with him on account of his <HI>forefinger</HI>—</P>
<P>As the Count had crossed one of the private court-yards, unfortunate for the old Dutchess of B— he had occasion to draw—off his <HI>glove</HI>—the old Dutchess of B—was at that instant peeping at the Count through a lattice with her <HI>magnifying</HI> glass, and the <HI>forefinger</HI> of the Count hit exactly upon her grace's <HI>focus.</HI></P>
<P>Her grace could not avoid gazing on the Count's <HI>forefinger</HI>—</P>
<P>The Count wore <HI>two brilliants</HI> on his <HI>fore∣finger</HI> —they were <HI>family jewels,</HI> the Count's <HI>father</HI> had given them to his <HI>mother,</HI> his <HI>mo∣ther</HI> had given them to him—they rivetted the eyes of the old Dutchess of B—with as fascinating a power, as if she had gazed upon a <HI>rattle-snake</HI>—</P>
<P>The old Dutchess was experienced in the value of <HI>brilliants,</HI> and the instant she per∣ceived those on the Count's <HI>forefinger,</HI> her grace exclaimed, never did I see such a <HI>finger!</HI>
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
never did I see such <HI>brilliants!</HI>—they are only fit for a Queen!—</P>
<P>The Dutchess of B— was avaricious, therefore the instant the idea of the Queen came across her grace, she concluded, that if these <HI>brilliants,</HI> which garnished Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI>'s forefinger, could be procured for her Majesty of Portugal—her own fortune was made—</P>
<P>Little did the Dutchess of B— think, that by this determination she would serve not only the Queen of Portugal, but the armed neutrality of Europe.</P>
<P>Some say that the Count having perceived the old Dutchess of B—speculating through the lattice, and knowing her to be in the Queen's confidence, he drew off his glove on purpose; but whether he did or did not, whe∣ther the action was <HI>accidental</HI> or <HI>manoeuvre,</HI> it is certain, that the Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> got <HI>into</HI> the Queen's <HI>confidence</HI> by it—</P>
<P>When the old Dutchess of B— inform∣ed the Queen of Portugal of what she had seen, her Portuguese Majesty smiled—you
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
must be mistaken, my dear Dutchess, said the Queen, I never heard of so white, so taper a <HI>forefinger,</HI> nor of such <HI>brilliants</HI> as you have described—if they are so large, they must be equal in value to the famous diamond worn by the Great Mogul, and exceed that in the hat of the French King—you have been de∣ceived by a false appearance—consider, my dear, dear Dutchess, you were looking thro' a <HI>magnifying</HI> glass—</P>
<P>The Queen was right, and the Queen was wrong—the Dutchess of B— was right— and the Dutchess of B— was wrong—the old Dutchess was deceived, not in the <HI>mag∣nitude,</HI> but in the quality of what she supposed to be <HI>brilliants</HI>—they were nothing better than common <HI>Irish diamonds,</HI> which are plenty in London and Paris—</P>
<P>In Lisbon, they had <HI>novelty</HI> to recommend them—</P>
<P>We must keep up decorum, said the Queen of Portugal to the Dutchess of B— before we admit Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> to our presence; you must enquire into the nature of his bu∣siness

<P>Then you will not <HI>trust</HI> me? said the old Dutchess—</P>
<P>By heaven, I will not <HI>trust</HI> you, my Lady Dutchess, nor any other Lady in the court— the court Ladies hung down their heads—</P>
<P>I am keeper of the Queen's <HI>secrets</HI>—said the old Dutchess of B—</P>
<P>But you are not keeper of my <HI>secrets,</HI> an∣swered Count <HI>O'Dunn.</HI></P>
<P>The old Dutchess fixing her eye upon the Count's <HI>forefinger,</HI> took him by the hand, and led him to the Queen's apartment—</P>

<HEAD>THE HEM-SIGNAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dutchess had much at <HI>stake,</HI> she had drawn a picture for the Queen, and she knew the consequence, if the original should fall <HI>short</HI> of the copy. She had some doubts from what the Queen had started, that her <HI>magnifying</HI> glass might have deceived her <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">I was once very much deceived in a scene of my own writing, which depended upon the doctrine of <HI>proportions.</HI> The figure of an <HI>Hercules</HI> cloathed was to have been exhibited in my comedy of the WORLD AS IT GOES, <HI>alias,</HI> SECOND THOUGHTS ARE BEST, but the villainous property-man, had the fellow who represented the demi-god, put upon the pedestal as <HI>naked.</HI> I intended the figure should have been <HI>fully proportioned</HI> in all its <HI>parts</HI>; whereas a <HI>narrow-shouldered</HI> man was chosen—so that when the <HI>female-virtuoso,</HI> who was to have been rendered ridiculous, by applying <HI>disproportions</HI> to a <HI>propor∣tioned</HI> figure, came to give her judgment, the <HI>satire</HI> was <HI>lost,</HI> the fellow who <HI>played</HI> the <HI>statue</HI> being ac∣tually, in appearance,
<Q>too <HI>narrow</HI> in the <HI>thorax</HI> to hold the <HI>vital parts,</HI> and horridly <HI>disproporti∣oned</HI> in the <HI>fore-shortening</HI> of <HI>one</HI> of his <HI>members.</HI></Q>

<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
Her fears, however, subsided, upon her in∣terview with the Count. She viewed him without her glass, and joy flushed her cheeks. She measured him with her eyes, as a female virtuoso measures the beautiful representa∣tions of <HI>nature</HI> in the galleries of Italy—</P>
<P>The Dutchess of B—had been a wo∣man of remarkable <HI>sensibility. Sympathy</HI> was her <HI>weakness.</HI> In her youth she had found the highest satisfaction in <HI>communicating</HI> pleasure to others, and her greatest pleasure now was in <HI>procuring</HI> it. Yet no woman had ever given more <HI>pain</HI> than the Dutchess of B— but then no woman had ever gone further than the Dutchess of B— to <HI>alleviate</HI> the pain she had given. <HI>Man</HI> never <HI>kneeled</HI> to her <HI>grace</HI> in vain, nor petitioned her <HI>grace</HI> without relief <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">An old lady of <HI>my</HI> acquaintance is just such another merciful character.<BIBL>—H—RR—N, <HI>Dowg.</HI></BIBL></NOTE>—</P>
<P>The Dutchess of B— having approached the door of the royal closet, gave a loud <HI>hem.</HI> —This hem informed the Queen of Portugal that Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> was near—</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="245"/>Her majesty of Portugal was at that instant standing before a great glass, wrapped up in admiration of herself. All Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal, but no subject in Portugal admired the Queen of Portugal more, than the Queen of Portugal admired herself—</P>
<P>Yet the Queen was not vain—she knew the power of her charms, from their <HI>effects</HI> upon mankind, and the subject of her consideration now was, to muster and draw out in amorous array, their full force armed at all points against Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI>—</P>
<P>But the whole system of the Queen of Portugal's intended operations against the Count, was overturned by the <HI>hem-signal</HI> of the Dutchess of B—. Every glance, every leer, every smile, every giggle, which <HI>art</HI> had armed for her assistance and long experience had exercised into discipline, fled at the in∣stant the <HI>hem-signal</HI> was given; nor could the Queen, with all her generalship, rally them into order—nature had taken possession of their post, and defied the powers of <HI>art</HI> to dislodge her.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTERVIEW.</HEAD>
<P>THE Queen of Portugal, as many able commanders have done, threw herself upon <HI>chance</HI>—she sat upon a sopha—the <HI>door</HI> of the closet <HI>opened</HI>—the <HI>eyes</HI> of the Queen <HI>shut</HI>—</P>
<P>The complexion of the Queen of Portugal was a bright olive—Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> never considered colours—he admired the whole sex —every colour had its attraction for him— he loved <HI>woman,</HI> because she was <HI>woman</HI>; and to this generous affection he bore to <HI>woman</HI> kind, may be imputed a passion, the most ge∣nerous and disinterested, which from his youth he had entertained for an individual.</P>
<P>The Count made his obeisance—the Queen opened her eyes—the Count dropped the cur∣tains of his eyes—a dead silence ensued—</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="247"/>The Dutchess of B—broke silence— she introduced the Count in form, as pleni-potentiary from the court of France, and re∣collecting his declaration, in refusing to com∣municate his business to any person but the Queen in <HI>private,</HI> she retired, as a woman of discretion should—shut the door—fell upon her knees—and applied her eye, close to the <HI>key-hole</HI>—</P>
<P>Had Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> been before all the male crowned heads in Europe, he would not have evinced diffidence—had Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> been marching up against a battery, he would not have betrayed fear—yet the Count was silent, and trembled before the Queen of Portugal.</P>
<P>Pray, Captain, said Maria, perceiving I rested at the conclusion of the last sentence, what made Count <HI>O'Dunn</HI> tremble?</P>
<P>If you do not know, Madam, you must ask the naturalists—answered the Captain.</P>
<P><HI>Maria</HI> had a quick conception—she found it dangerous to require a more minute ex∣planation —so requested I would proceed—</P>

<HEAD>O'DUNN'S NEGOTIATION.</HEAD>
<P>HER majesty of Portugal began the ne∣gotiation, whereas it was the duty of the Count to have began—but in truth he had forgot the interest of the <HI>neutral</HI> powers —there was nothing neutral about him—</P>
<P>Your prudence, Sir, said the Queen, in not communicating your business to any of my ministers, proves you worthy of your em∣ployment —the business of politicks should never be carried on through a <HI>medium</HI>—</P>
<P>It is quite contrary in affairs of love, please your Majesty, answered the Count—</P>
<P>You are certainly right, replied the Queen, giving up all thoughts of <HI>politicks,</HI> a <HI>medium</HI> in love is to be preferred—and the man who would reach a woman's heart, must first dis∣cover the proper <HI>medium.</HI>—The cool lover is despicable—an over-warm passion is seldom
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
lasting—but I should wish to hear your opinion upon the <HI>subject</HI>—</P>
<P>It is too difficult a subject for me, said the Count, I have attempted to discuss it a thou∣sand and a thousand times, but could never reach the <HI>end</HI>—love is a subject which defies the power of logick, of philosophy, of ma∣thematicks. —I have tried love <HI>every way,</HI> said Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> and I have been told, that those who have tried it scientifically and systematically, have found themselves little better than <HI>fools</HI> upon the <HI>subject</HI>—</P>
<P>I knew a <HI>fool,</HI> said the old Dutchess of B— taking her eye from the key-hole— who could handle the subject better than the wisest of them all—</P>
<P>Bless me, exclaimed the Queen, throwing her eye upon the Count's <HI>forefinger,</HI> how re∣miss have I been in keeping you <HI>standing</HI> so long—</P>
<P>It is my duty, answered the Count, to <HI>stand</HI> in your Majesty's presence—</P>
<P>But as you are the representative of a King, replied the Queen, I insist upon your sitting—</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="250"/>The Count being seated upon a sopha with the Queen, proceeded upon the business of the neutral powers—he presented his <HI>creden∣tials</HI> —the Queen of Portugal <HI>examined</HI> them —she spoke of her obligations to England— the Count withdrew his <HI>credentials</HI> from her hand—the Queen drew them back—examin∣ed them again—the Count <HI>pushed</HI> the point <HI>closer</HI>—still the Queen objected, but <HI>faintly.</HI> The Count maintained his <HI>point</HI>—</P>
<P>Your Majesty may perceive, said the Count, turning up his <HI>credentials</HI> towards the Queen, so as to shew the two <HI>brilliants</HI> the Dutchess of B—had mentioned, your Majesty may perceive, said he, it is a plain proposition—</P>
<P>The Queen of Portugal <HI>answered</HI>—</P>
<P>The Count <HI>O'Dunn replied</HI>—</P>
<P>The Queen of Portugal <HI>rebutted</HI>—</P>
<P>The Count <HI>O'Dunn surrebutted.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>submit,</HI> said the Queen—you have <HI>pre∣vailed</HI> —I give England—I give up every thing —I give up the world to your argument, Count <HI>O!</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="251"/>Before the Queen could fully pronounce the Count's name, <HI>O'Dunn</HI> had put the pen in her hand, and her Majesty subscribed to the neutral confederacy—</P>
<P>Oh! ejaculated the Queen of Portugal—</P>
<P>Ah! ejaculated the old Dutchess of B— and she fell upon the floor—such is the power of sympathy, it flew through the key-hole, and hit the old Dutchess full on the brain—</P>
<P>France has carried the day, said the old Dutchess of B—opening the door, and entering the room—</P>
<P>Upon my soul, but you are out now, an∣swered Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> as he put up his <HI>credentials</HI>—it was Ireland that carried the day—so making a bow, he retired, to dispatch a courier to Paris—</P>
<P>Now the Dutchess of B—having writ∣ten an account of <HI>O'Dunn</HI>'s negotiation with the Queen of Portugal, to Madam <HI>D'C</HI>— Lady of the French Queen's Bed-chamber, the French Queen insisted, that the French King should recall Count <HI>O'Dunn,</HI> from an apprehension, that he might be assassinated—</P>

<HEAD>UN PETIT SOUPER.</HEAD>
<P>THE evening-dew beginning to fall heavy, <HI>Maria</HI> proposed returning home. When we arrived at the town the Captain took his leave, having previously insisted, that I should accompany him the next morning at six, to see a royal chace.</P>
<P><HI>Maria,</HI> as we walked towards her lodgings, corroborated my suspicion, that the Captain was a dying swain to virgin <HI>Verjuice</HI>; and as∣sured me of much entertainment from the history of his amours, the Captain having, for a series of years, been a constant dangler af∣ter rich old maids, and endowed widows of various descriptions—</P>
<P>We found the cloth laid, and supper was served in, almost immediately after we enter∣ed the parlour—two plates upon the table in∣formed me, that my company was expected,
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
and having no inclination to retreat suddenly, I sat down to table with as easy familiarity, as if I had been one of the family—I saw <HI>Maria</HI> was pleased at the frankness of my conduct—and what can be more pleasing than an unceremonious chearful acquiescence in partaking of the hospitable preparations of a friend.—The supper would have lost half its relish by a formal invitation—</P>
<P>You must help yourself, said <HI>Maria,</HI> lay∣ing the wing of a duck upon her plate, I fol∣lowed her example—</P>
<P>Here is wine, said <HI>Maria</HI>—</P>
<P>A dumb-waiter, which stood at my right∣hand, answered all the purposes of ostentatious attendance—we sat in the full enjoyment of liberty and social festivity—eat, talked, and laughed, without restraint—</P>
<P>I must fill to the brim, said I, taking up a decanter of Madeira—<HI>Maria</HI> smiled consent —it is to the continuance of our love, my dear <HI>Maria—Maria</HI> blushed—she hung her head, but as she hung her head, she turned up her eye—</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="254"/>Let it overflow, said <HI>Maria,</HI> and she sighed —let it overflow—I will pledge you with all my soul—</P>
<P>And I am all impatience, added I—my heart is thirsty for the toast—</P>
<P>We sipped from our brimmers—touched glasses, and changed glasses—I tasted the nec∣tar of <HI>Maria</HI>'s lip upon her glass—the touch had raised the sparkle of the wine, and the wine had given her eyes additional lustre— their power was irresistible—I must quench this flame, thought I, as I swallowed my wine —but wine is oil to the lamp of love—the flame from my heart increased—</P>
<P>I got close to <HI>Maria</HI>'s side, and pressed her hand—we drank again, touched glasses, and touched cheeks—I had thrown my arm neg∣ligently across the back of her chair—my head reclined upon her bosom—<HI>Maria</HI> rung a bell that lay upon the table, the servant appeared, she ordered him to remove the supper-table—</P>

<HEAD>AN ILLUSTRATION, OR THE EXTINGUISHER.</HEAD>
<P>DO you know, said <HI>Maria,</HI> sighing, as the servant left the room, that I have been thinking continually upon the cruelties, which the Captain told us were inflicted upon the poor <HI>negroes,</HI> by their merciless task-masters— he says there are noble souls among these people—</P>
<P>Shakespeare was of the same opinion, said I, when he drew the character of <HI>Othello</HI>—</P>
<P>Your speaking of <HI>Othello,</HI> said <HI>Maria,</HI> re∣minds me of a passage in the play, which I could never understand—I mean that line where <HI>Othello</HI> says—
<Q>Put out the light, and then put out the light.</Q>
—I could never re∣ceive any satisfaction from the commentators.</P>
<P>There lay upon a couch, close to <HI>Maria,</HI> a silver chamber-candlestick and <HI>extinguisher</HI>—</P>
