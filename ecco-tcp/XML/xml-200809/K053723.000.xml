<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Opera was written upon the spur of the occasion; a circumstance which may palliate, though not excuse its faults. The subject of the fable remains as in the original; but a few alterations have been made in its construction; and the writer has attempted to heighten the characters by a colouring of humour.</P>
<P>FEW pieces have experienced a more extra∣ordinary persecution. Previous to its ap∣pearance, the Manager and Writer were pestered with anonymous letters, threaten∣ing its destruction, by the force of party, for their daring to attempt an emulous op∣position to the Romance under the same title then preparing at <HI>Drury Lane:</HI> and, after it appeared, several of the prints teemed with severe animadversions and abuse.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6"/>ONE critic displayed his judgment with great ingenuity and candour: he opened his old school satchell, and quoted both Greek and Latin, to point out passages analogous to classic ideas; every literal error of the press was produced and animadverted on with astonishing ability; he found prosaic lines in the poetry, and poetic thoughts in the prose; but, above all, he made this great discovery, that the sentiments of <HI>loyalty</HI> breathed through the dialogue, were inimi∣cal to the British constitution.</P>
<P>As men of sensibility <HI>feel</HI> when their ge∣nerosity is brought forward, this critic shall not be put to the blush, but be permitted to indulge in the secret satisfaction arising from his friendly exertions.</P>
