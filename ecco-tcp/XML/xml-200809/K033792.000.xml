KING DIONYSIUS AND SQUIRE DAMOCLES; A New Song on an Old Story. Proper to be sung at all Feasts and Merry-makings.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was a heathen man, sir,</L>
<L>Belonging to a King;</L>
<L>And still it was his plan, sir,</L>
<L>To covet every thing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And if you don't believe me,</L>
<L>I'll name him if you please,</L>
<L>For let me not deceive ye,</L>
<L>'Twas one Squire Damocles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He thought that jolly living</L>
<L>Must every joy afford,</L>
<L>And knew of no misgiving,</L>
<L>While round the festive board.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He wanted to be great, sir,</L>
<L>And fed on fare delicious,</L>
<L>And have his feasts in state, sir,</L>
<L>Just like King Dionysius.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The King, to cure his longing,</L>
<L>Prepar'd a feast so fine,</L>
<L>That all the Court were thronging</L>
<L>To see the Courtier dine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And there to tempt his eye, sir,</L>
<L>Was fish, and flesh, and fowl,</L>
<L>And when he was a-dry, sir,</L>
<L>He had a brimming bowl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor did the King forbid him</L>
<L>From drinking all he could;</L>
<L>The Monarch never chid him,</L>
<L>But fill'd him with his food.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O then, to see the pleasure</L>
<L>Squire Damocles exprest!</L>
<L>'Twas joy beyond all measure;</L>
<L>Was ever man so blest?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With greedy eyes the Squire</L>
<L>Devour'd each costly dainty;</L>
<L>You'd think he did aspire</L>
<L>To eat as much as twenty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But just as he prepar'd, sir,</L>
<L>Of bliss to take his swing;</L>
<L>O, how the man was scar'd, sir!</L>
<L>By this so cruel King!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When he to eat intended,</L>
<L>Lo! just above his head,</L>
<L>He spied a sword suspended</L>
<L>All by a single thread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How did it change the feasting</L>
<L>To wormwood and to gall,</L>
<L>To think, while he was tasting,</L>
<L>The pointed sword might fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then in a moment's time, sir,</L>
<L>He loath'd the luscious feast;</L>
<L>And dreaded, as a crime, sir,</L>
<L>The brimming bowl to taste.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, if you're for applying</L>
<L>The story I have told,</L>
<L>I think there's no denying</L>
<L>'Tis worth its weight in gold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye gay, who view this stranger,</L>
<L>And pity his sad case;</L>
<L>And think there was great danger</L>
<L>In Damocles's case;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come let this aweful truth</L>
<L>In all your minds be stor'd;</L>
<L>That DEATH o'er every youth</L>
<L>Hangs like a pointed sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And tho' you see no reason,</L>
<L>To check your mirth at all;</L>
<L>In some sad drunken season</L>
<L>The sword on you may fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So learn, while at your ease</L>
<L>You drink down draughts delicious,</L>
<L>To think of Damocles,</L>
<L>And old King Dionysius.</L>
