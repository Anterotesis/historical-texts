<P>DR. Melbank acquaints me you have hurt your wrist, and that it gives you great pain: I feel a sincere affliction upon two accounts arising from this accident; first, be∣cause it occasions uneasiness to you, and, secondly, because it prevents your making use of the pen. How∣ever,
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
I charge you not to venture too soon to exert it. Rather let me be two or three days <HI>without</HI> your agree∣able favours, than <HI>with</HI> them at the cost of your inconvenience: I will endeavour to support the loss of your correspondence, in the hope that your health may be the sooner restored: and as I myself get better every hour, I will do my best to entertain you with a double portion of packets.</P>
<P>Am I not grown a great philoso∣pher? do I not at last acquiesce in your own system? do I not obey your inhibitions with even a scru∣pulous ceremony? and am I not a mere correspondent? am I not the cold creature you wish me?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>Yes Charlotte, I will yield to your punctilious principles. I will not murmur, nor will attempt again to invade your repose by desiring a personal interview, till the way to it is smoothed by providence. That this will be the case, I am certain. In the mean time I will endeavour to be contented with this remote, yet en∣dearing intercourse, though Melbank has been labouring to persuade me it would be more for the health of my mind and body that I dropt the plea∣sures of the pen. Of this he can never convince me; though I have received from him the tenderest treatment, and find him to be an able surgeon, and an amiable man.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>I this morning had a penny post letter from him, which, that I may do <HI>him</HI> justice, and give <HI>your</HI> gentle heart satisfaction, I inclose.</P>

This, Sir, is the state of the case between you and I. I am almost ready to confess myself in∣debted to the accident that brought us together. The wounds, in which I have been an happy instrument of cure, have been, the means of mak∣ing known to me a man of eminent abilities, and excellent qualities. In the midst of torture and cross circum∣stances, how have I been entertained

<P>MR. Templeton has transmitted to me a little rural poem, written by a literary friend of his: there is a novelty in the story, and

a simplicity in the sentiment, that par∣ticularly recommends it to persons of feeling. For this reason I am going to transcribe it for your perusal.</P>
<P>I am always happier while I am employed either in thinking of you, or in any degree contributing to your entertainment. Were it not for bend∣ing my mind assiduously to these little epistolary engagements, and by these means soothing my hopes, and lulling my cares, I should not, I fear, be able to keep my promise, or withstand the impulses of my heart, which would carry me perforce into the apartment of Charlotte. I hope by to-morrow you will be able to take up the pen, and give me your

<P>I FEEL myself to blame. I have interdicted a correspondence, that gives both you and Charles pleasure, and I am much afraid the health of my patient was not the only motive that led me to this. The <HI>real</HI> motive I dare not discover. Be it some atonement, that I acquaint you Charles's health is not likely to be hurt, or his cure retarded, by the letters of Charlotte.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER LXIX.</HI> From the same to <HI>HAMLET TEMPLETON,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WHAT must I do, Mr. Tem∣pleton? I am under an em∣barrassment, from the pains of which I can by no means disengage myself? Will <HI>you,</HI> who are in some degree a party concerned, give me your advice. To cut short the idle formalities of ceremonious introduction, I must open to you the nature of my dilemma at once. Would you believe it, Mr. Templeton; while I have been attempting to cure Charles,
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
I have been myself wounded by Char∣lotte: yes, Sir, widower as I am, again am I caught in the nets of beauty and merit, and am vainly trying every possible effort to forget the form that undid my repose." I have already been led into meanesses by this clan∣destine passion: it has urged me to desire Charlotte to forbear writing, under pretence of its interfering with my endeavours to restore Charles's health. I have visited this lovely wo∣man several times, and have had the mortification to hear her heave a thou∣sand sighs, and to see her shed a thou∣sand tears; although she still remains sixt in her resolution of never again uniting herself to him, I have not had the courage to hint at my parti∣ality;
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
and to tell you the truth, Sir, I am witheld from such declarations from various motives. I have con∣ceived a tender esteem for Charles, and I am unwilling to give him pain. I consider myself as standing in a very delicate light, and I know not how I can reconcile the different cha∣racters of a surgeon, a friend, and a lover. I fairly confess to you, I never saw any woman so formed to please, as Charlotte: as to her having been connected with another, were not that other Charles, I should make that no objection to offer her at once my heart, hand, and for∣tune. My profession is merely an object of my choice, not of neces∣sity, and I have an income that could
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
support the woman of my affections affluently. Were it not for the ap∣pearance of duplicity, which I can∣not bear, I should certainly make such overtures to Charlotte, as might put both my love and my principles out of dispute. Such a woman, Sir, would grace the arms, and bless the heart, of a monarch; and I should rejoice to lead her by the hand into the embraces of all my family, and all my friends.</P>
<P>At the same time, what can I do? would not such advances, coming thus suddenly from me, look like taking advantages of sickness, and separation? Charles's tenderness is too palpable! Charlotte's love is by
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
no means worn off. I see them both every day, and I every day find in both fresh excellencies which it would be inhuman to injure. Who knows what may happen! Cleora may die; many events, may, under the direc∣tion of an indulgent god, auspiciously concur to bring Charles and Charlotte once more into the arms of each other. I may be looked upon as an usurper, as a supplanter of affection: and what makes the matter still worse, is, that I have very lately done myself the pleasure of accommodating Charles with what the world considers an im∣portant favour. I have lent him money; it is therefore the worst time in the world to make proposals. The poor lad's nerves too, are at present all
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
on the tremble; his strength is but just returning; his heart is greatly agitated; he cannot get out of his chamber—what, can be done Mr. Templeton? as a friend to all par∣ties, tell me—I am truly wretched myself, and yet I should be ashamed, if I wanted fortitude to prevent the wretchedness of others; particularly those, whom I have had the honour to oblige.</P>

alarming; you may, for aught I know, be at this moment on the bed of sickness—you may be in the agonies of a sore distemper—you may have broken a limb.

He stammers; he offers me a feeble excuse; he equivocates; and he ab∣ruptly goes away blushing, because he cannot disguise the truth, in the veil of a better apology. My imagi∣nation represents you in a condition, at which my heart achs; perhaps you are fainting, and I am not by to catch you in my arms: you are perhaps sick, and I am not present to administer the cordials of recovery—
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
you are weeping, and I am too distant to kiss away the tear—the point is plain; and this is the truth of the whole matter; if you do not, with your own hand, answer this hasty letter, which I dispatch by a porter, I shall draw the natural conclusions— I shall judge the horrors of your situation, and, weak as I am, venture abroad to offer my assistance.</P>

<P>IT is with a sincere pleasure I find myself again able to address my valuable correspondent; and I use this first moment of resuming the pen to thank him for his letters, and the poem: all which, I read with great satisfaction. It is very true that I have been some time in your debt, but you wall now receive a receipt in full; for this epistle will certainly compensate for all that is due, and make the balances even. Since the correspondence on my side
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
has been necessarily suspended, Dr. Melbank has favoured me with a friendly call or two, and, in his last visit finding me much dispirited, he entertained me by reciting the prin∣cipal passages in his own life. I was saying how hard it was to <HI>lose a friend,</HI> at the time one is most thoroughly sensible of his merit: upon this he sighed—pressed his hand upon his heart, and wiping a tear from his eyes, said, it was <HI>indeed hard;</HI> "I have experienced it most severely, Madam, said he, and, notwithstand∣ing my present flow of fortune, and fulness of practice, I dare say I have undergone more than you would wish an <HI>enemy</HI> to suffer.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIV. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>"MY adventures, Madam," said Dr. Melbank, "shall be re∣lated as briefly as the intricacy and variety of them will admit—I was born under all the smiles of fortune, having a man of sense and property for my father, a woman of beauty and honour for my mother, and no other relations whatever alive, that were likely to dispute with me, the right of succession. But alas! Madam, from my first birth-day to the seventh year of my age, it seemed to be the
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
contrivance of fortune to enrich me: for m father engaged in a business that ruined his constitution and estate in the same instant. He extended his trade till he became involved in a thousand hopeless calamities — He carried his ambitious schemes of mer∣chandise, till he rashly run into all the extravagance of giving credit: he trusted to an agent, who, as is common enough, turned out a rascal, and being at last obliged to attend vigilantly to his own affairs, he em∣barked for the east, where he had considerable dealings, to gather in desperate debts to a great amount— there he caught a fever in the pas∣sage — lingered for some days—wrote a letter to my mother during his
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
sickness, and absolutely died at last, a martyr to that ambition, which in∣duces a man to give up, according to the common phrase—a certainty for an uncertainty. True it is, that I was his only heir; but had there been fifty competitors, not one would have long felt the spirit of litigation rising within them: for, when mat∣ters came to be examined, the poor man's ambition for becoming the man of business, had buried his real estate in the ruins of an imaginary property: and all that he left behind him descended into the hands of a merciless crew of creditors, who veri∣fied at least, one passage of scripture, by taking care, in all such cases,
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
that the sins of the father shall be visited on the children."</P>
<P>"My mother, Madam, loved her husband so much better than her own life, that in the phrenzy of af∣fection, she was frequently prevented from making a sacrifice to his ashes, of that beautiful form on which he had doated: time, however, brought her usual lenitive, and the widow began at length to think it her duty to share the poverty and misfortunes that was by this event, entailed upon her child. Her constitution was always delicate, and this sore stroke gave additional force to a disorder which was hereditary to the female side of our family. She had the
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
asthma in all its violence, and, in a few months, it reduced her to a shadow. As this excellent woman had been too affectionate to secure to herself an original marriage-set∣tlement, and the claimants were therefore generous enough to allow a few suits of half-worn apparel, which properly belonged to her own person; and after this, it was not easy to find a poorer pair than now exhibited themselves in Mrs. Mel∣bank, and her fatherless son."</P>
<P>"Maternal love, nevertheless, in∣creased, in proportion to the neces∣sity there was to exert it. For some little time she tried the feelings of those who had been the companions
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
of her prosperity, but that soon failing, she applied to a resource, which may generally be depended on; <HI>i. e.</HI> pro∣vided the application be earnest: in a word, Madam, she withdrew from the smiling apologies, and civil evasions of friendship, to her own in∣dustry. Being educated in all the accomplishments of her sex, and particularly skilful at her needle, she chearfully undertook to assist ladies in those very decorations which she was a short time before entitled to wear herself—Nay—such. was her humility, she condescended to manage the work of those very women, whom in the life-time of her late husband, she visited upon terms of equality and intimacy; but fortune,
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
you know, Madam, elevates and de∣grades, sometimes in the same hour."</P>
<P>"From these efforts, I mean out of her work, she not only accommo∣dated me with food, but instruction, paying regularly for my schooling, and providing for me every comfort of mind and body."</P>
<P>"In this manner, with very few helps, were, we subsisted for several years, till at length her disorder grew, so bad, that she was totally unable to proceed in the business— a business, Madam, which want had urged her to undertake. As I was de∣ficient neither in gratitude, nor filial feelings, and was by this time ar∣rived
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
at the age of distinguishing, judge the state of my mind, at per∣ceiving the dear person to whom I had been so long indebted, declin∣ing away in silent and wasting agony, under my eye: her physician recommended change of air; and I therefore removed her a few miles distant, to a little village contiguous to the Thames. Still, Madam, the cruel distemper gained upon all our endeavours, and neither sunshine, ver∣dure, nor rural breezes, could restore her. Sixteen days did she lay pant∣ing in the extremity, at the end of which time, we had exhausted all the little savings that the exactest oeconomy had hoarded up against a rainy day, after the necessary ex∣pences
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
of our subsistance were an∣swered."</P>
<P>"For my own part, bred as I was to no employment, and but just raw from school, I knew neither the value of talents, nor the means of getting money, by art, or by dili∣gence; but our affairs were now come to the crisis. My poor mother lay speechless: the woman with whom we lodged, pitied her extremely, and, as an instance of it, began to tell us how inconvenient it was for folks like she and her husband, who had a small house, to let lodgings. The husband spoke first obliquely, and then directly, of a cousin, that was upon the road, to stay with them
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
during the fair time; and, in the progress of their observations, they made very pertinent comments on those excellent places of resource for poor wretches—the public hos∣pitals—Assylums, said they, where those who want diet and doctors, and yet have no method to procure either, may get both for nothing — In this exigence, Madam, upon the edge of every thing dreadful, famine on the one hand, and despair on the other, I sallied out of the house, re∣solved not to come back with an empty pocket—Accordingly, in the distraction of my mind, and in the simplicity of my head, I opened my case to the very first person I saw. The first person I saw, happened to
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
be such a one, as, I fear, "take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again." He was on horseback, not resident in the town, but merely passing through it. With∣out scarce knowing what I was about, I told him the incoherent story, but told it to the heart—and never —no, Madam—by my soul, never shall I forget the anxious air, and melting tone with which he said—Talk no more, poor youth, talk no more, but quickly lead me to your mother. What a tear did he shed on my hand as he dismounted from his horse—O God! Madam, my only surviving parent was breath∣ing her last as we entered. She had not strength to speak—she could resist
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
the attacks of her fate, but faintly— it was just allowed her to say, fault∣eringly—kiss me, my son; and even as I was stooping to obey her, the lip quivered in death—in the next moment she was an angel."</P>
<P>"This worthy stranger buried my mother with all the attention, and sacred decency, due to a parent of his own; and, for a long time after∣wards, he supplied me with every thing that cou'd sooth the mind, or comfort the body. But, alas! this refuge was soon taken from me; the gentleman died suddenly, and I was once more left upon the wide world, an orphan, without a friend. I was now reduced to seek for subsistence
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
in the capacity of a servant, and had the good fortune to be taken in by a nneighbouring apothecary for the me∣nial purpose of carrying out his drugs. It was at <HI>his</HI> house, Madam, that I first saw the exact resemblance of yourself—similar in sense—similar in beauty. I shall not, however, trouble you with the annals of my courtship: the apothecary took a particular lik∣ing to me, and after I had been his servant two years, exalted me to the dignity of being his <HI>son,</HI> destitute as I was, and gave me his only daughter, intending, that I should continue with him, and learn his business. He died, however, in less than six weeks, and continued his partiality, by bequeath∣ing to me and his beloved Maria

—so was my wife called—his whole fortune, amounting to near three hun∣dred pounds a year in landed pro∣perty, besides a good house: as an honest man, I must tell you, Madam, that the apothecary had a nephew, which, having disobliged him, he never had seen for many years, and though he was once to have been the chief heir, was not so much as men∣tioned in his last sentiments."</P>
<P>"Of this, indeed, I did not hear, till I had spent the whole fortune; for Maria had never seen the young man, and his uncle never spoke of him to her. Since I have known the fact, I have vainly endeavoured to find the youth, that I might make
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
him amends; but my researches have not been yet rewarded, and the apo∣thecary's old friends tell me they be∣lieve he is dead."</P>
<P>"A foolish ambition is, I believe, hereditary to my family. I had no sooner got a competence, than I left the country—sold my house there; and, thinking that my observation had qualified me for the apothecary business, I opened, in an absurd hurry, a shop of my own. I laid out a large sum, to the worst advan∣tage, with a druggist, and finding myself without connections, I <HI>adver∣tised</HI> for custom. During this period I was surely possessed, for, contrary to the intreaties of my wife, whom I
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
adored, even while I contradicted, I resolved to go on: nay, not to have any reserve with you, I was so plung'd in this medical madness, that I pur∣chased all the pompous <HI>parapherna∣lia</HI> of the doctor, and, in the shop of an apothecary, had all the tremendous apparatus of a surgeon. I give you leave to laugh at me, when I tell you, that I cropt close to my ears, a fine flowing head of hair, to surround my lunatic pate by a set of enormous curls, rising, in formidable exact∣ness, tier above tier, in all the ma∣jesty of a physician. I became per∣fect in the pat on the snuff-box, the management of the graver muscles, and the swing of the cane: I knew the several uses of the watch. I af∣fected
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
to abridge my Latin, and to sign the initials of my name as <HI>unin∣telligibly</HI> and obliquely as possible; and, to sum up the whole, I should certainly have ventured upon an equi∣page—that most necessary of all pom∣pous appendages—had not my poor girl, with streaming eyes told me, (what really was but too probable) that all those accomplishments would be of no sort of service, and that she verily feared, neither chariots, nor chirurgical instruments, nor drugs, nor gallipots, would be of any conse∣quence, till I could prove to the fa∣culty, and to my friends, that I un∣derstood something of the profession, beyond its <HI>pomps and vanities.</HI> I began to think there was some truth
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
in my wife's remark, for I could nei∣ther get any mortal to tell me he was <HI>sick;</HI> nor any man that wished me well, who did not tell me that he was <HI>sorry.</HI> One day, however, fortune was determined to throw a job in my way. It happened that a man was thrown from a ladder as he was re∣pairing a house, and, in his fall, broke his leg, at the threshold of my door—God forgive me, Madam, but judging it to be a simple fracture, I blessed heaven for the accident. I first scribbled a prescription, in the capacity of a <HI>physician,</HI> then made it as an <HI>apothecary,</HI> and lastly, I began to feel the part, as a <HI>surgeon.</HI> I began at last to bandage the leg, and to bleed the arm: but the agitation I was in,
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
put me into such a trembling, that, (as I held the lancet unsteadily) I rambled from the vein, and fairly cut a slice from the brawny part of the arm: the patient, who was a stout fellow, started up enraged, and, swear∣ing that I knew no more how to bleed a man than his trowel, hopp'd out of the shop in search of an abler operator—notwithstanding these igno∣minious testimonies of my ignorance, I was obstinate enough to persist, till partly by pomp, and partly by va∣nity, I exhausted poor Maria's whole fortune: from this time I involved my dear contented girl in the effects of my folly, and we were both, for a long time, the dupes of caprice, and the slaves of apology. Reflec∣tion,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
and the remorse attending it, threw me upon the bed of sickness, and <HI>then</HI> it was that Maria hired a nurse to wait upon me, while <HI>she</HI> made application, and wrote circular appeals to the most opulent of her ac∣quaintance. She undertook this most irksome of all human engagements unknown to me; and it was not till after I got much better in my health, that she informed me of her miscar∣riage. Though I should have thought it impossible to turn the deaf ear to such a creature's request, yet she succeeded, as people of both sexes ge∣nerally do upon the like occasions. Curious, although common, were the evasions made use of: <HI>one,</HI> had un∣luckily just parted from all his money
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
—a second, had taken an oath that he never would lend a farthing more to his own brother; and the reason was, he had already suffered by his good-nature — a third, was exces∣sively-<HI>grieved</HI> for <HI>me</HI>—a fourth, was excessively grieved for <HI>Maria</HI>—a fifth, was excessively glad to see folly, ex∣travagance, and vanity, rewarded in this world—a sixth, told my wife that he made it a maxim never to give money, but that, as one good turn deserved another, he was ready to be even-handed with her, and give favour for favour—a seventh, said he had a sum to make up—and, in short, Madam, every one had an excuse; so that poor Maria returned convinced, that indigence <HI>professed,</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
is the only state that must find de∣sertion and deafness attend its peti∣tions."</P>
<P>"By this time I felt my folly in all the bitterness of consciousness; and in the midst of all these calamities my wife was far advanced in her pregnancy, when she fell down stairs, hurried on a premature labour, and died in my arms in the evening of the ninth day—I was many times tempted to deeds of impiety and despair; and, having my affairs in the utmost disorder, I went on board a tender, and, with very little money in my pocket more than would pay my passage (and even that obtained by the sale of my drugs—for alas!
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
my estate was long since gone)—I landed in Jamaica."</P>
<P>"As if fortune was once more re∣solved to befriend me, I was in the very ship with, a man of the first eminence as a surgeon, and of very considerable property, who had been to England to take <HI>possession</HI> of that property. His humanity was equal to his ingenuity: my history endeared me to him: he offered me his pity; and before we had arrived at the island, an accident happened that changed that pity into the tenderest friendship."</P>
<P>"He was one evening walking by moon-light upon the quarter deck,
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
when, by a sudden swell of the sea, (it being then a calm) he was thrown from his center, and fell overboard. As our ship was rolling, on he was soon at the stern, and I, who was the only person that saw his misfor∣tune, ran to the boatswain, alarmed the company, and ordered out a boat with all dispatch: mean-time I threw a large rope from the poop, and he had the good luck to swim near enough to reach it—By some means or other the boat was en∣tangled, and could not be easily ex∣tricated—I drew the gentleman by the rope to the ship's side—the calm was now quick dead, and little or no swell. I brought him within half a yard of the gunnel, and then,
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
stooping till I was even with the water, I dipt in my arms, while another man had girt a rope round my middle, and by clasping the poor exhausted surgeon in my arms with all my violence, the man above, fast∣ened the rope to a pully, and, at the risque of almost cutting me in two, for I was resolved not to let go my hold, drew us both up together.— From henceforward this gentleman and I were as brothers: for near five years, and a half he in every respect treated me as such: I studied with the utmost diligence under his tuition in the art of anatomy—I at∣tended him over all the islands in every case, and to every patient, and in the end I became a tolerable pro∣ficient.
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
In the mean time an opportunity of marrying to the utmost advantage, offered itself.— The idea of Maria prevented all such connections. Never was applica∣tion more intense, nor perhaps better rewarded—and I owed every thing to my friend whose name was William∣son. Had Maria lived to see this reverse of fortune, what could have been added unto me — At length, however, Dr. Williamson (who had not a relation alive that was known to him) died of a fever, then epide∣mical, in Jamaica — He made his will in my favour, and left me every thing he could call his own upon earth, except the portrait of a lady that hung round his neck, and which,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
in the same condition, was buried with him. The doctor's fortune was large, and it hath given me affluence, but not joy, for I had much rather my friend, and my wife had lived to share them.—"</P>
<P>"Here, Charles, the doctor ended, and giving a heavy sigh, took me kindly by the hand, and wished me a good night. What a multitude of revolutions, croud into the petty span of human existence!"</P>

<P>I HAVE a strange piece of news to communicate to my dear Charles: an old friend of mine has just written to me on a curious sub∣ject. He has, it seems, lately seen Charlotte, and is over head and ears in love with her: he has a large fortune, and is smitten so smartly, that he writes me word he intends to make serious proposals of marriage; and only wants me to assure him the connection betwixt you and her is actually dissolved. I really believe
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
he is in earnest, and he is a man of good sense, great connections, and splendid circumstances, besides being in one of the genteelest professions. What the deuce am I to say to him on this point? He presses for an answer, and I am utterly unprepared for it. For your part, I suppose you would not give your consent to her being the wife of an emperor; and yet, if this spark should make honourable advances, and offer such terms as are extremely flattering and advantageous, how would you act in that case? would you <HI>oppose,</HI> or would you <HI>promote,</HI> or would you stand <HI>neuter</HI> upon the occasion? shall I not do right, if I tell my friend the subject is too nice to be

<HEAD>LETTER LXXIX. CHARLES to H. T. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>I WRITE this letter to you in a place of confinement, to which I was carried, just as I was preparing to walk abroad for the first time since my illness. The shock has returned upon me a violent fever; by some means or other I fainted away in the coach, from surprize and weakness; and, I now find the dres∣sing has left my wound, and I am in a great deal of misery. This is the more unfortunate, as I am re∣solved not to let either Melbank or
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
Charlotte know a syllable about my situation: I have been already too much obliged by the one, and I cannot bear to be for ever racking the generosity of the other. How any of my creditors could possibly de∣tect my retreat, sequester'd as it was, and apart from all my former con∣nections, I cannot guess: evident enough it is, I <HI>am</HI> in prison, and for a debt of all others the least re∣collected, because I do not now suffer for myself, but for having made myself foolishly answerable for the extravagance of another: yet the creditor is a very humane man, and some cruel tamperings must have been used with him, before he could be brought to this measure. To en∣quire,
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
however, into these points is absurd. I am a most unfortunate man, and the hand of adversity is eternally upon me.</P>
<P>Since I came hither, I read your letter upon the subject of Charlotte's marriage. Ah! Mr. Templeton, how does <HI>self-love</HI> stand arm'd against the welfare of <HI>social?</HI> But sickness, and acute distress, hath, perhaps, mended both my heart and my ideas. I can now cooly consider myself as I really am; a man mark'd out from com∣munity to be eminently miserable: a young creature, whose own family have long confederated against him, even till the wishes, which could only be satisfied with his destruction, are
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
compleated. Yes, dear Templeton, I now behold myself with an impar∣tial eye—as a triumph to my ene∣mies, as an anguish to my friends— as a distress to those who have ever connected themselves with me. I blush to examine this picture of the truth, and the only atonement I can make, is to make a decent retreat from conscious error at once. In the first place, Templeton, let me endeavour, though very late, to do justice to Charlotte. A friend of yours, with all the advantages of birth, fortune, virtues, and a genteel profession, will marry her—will lead her by the hand, you say, and offer her terms of tenderness and honour. It is enough Templeton. I see
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
plainly my duty, and I am inspired by the prospect of it. Fully con∣vinced as you are of the gentleman's merit and circumstances, I shall rely upon your judgment, and enquire no more—Pray present my compli∣ments to him, and after you have read, and put a wafer under the inclosed letter, deliver it to him from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXX. CHARLES to Dr. MELBANK.</HEAD>
<P>FINDING myself perfectly stout, and my wound free from any pain, I have been bold enough to make an excursion into the country, just within reach of the penny-post, through whose medium I send this, and <HI>shall</HI> send my fu∣ture letters to you, and to Charlotte. I hope, by this time, your good sense and good nature have recom∣mended you to that lady's attention: I even wish your sentiments may have <HI>weight</HI> with her, because, in that

case, you may be of service in a matter wherein her fortunes are nearly concerned. To speak plain, Dr. Melbank, an opportunity invites, which should not be neglected: a gentleman of great property, and many amiable qualities, is struck, I find (as indeed he well might be) with the beautiful form of Charlotte. His views are noble: he is well ac∣quainted with her late connection, and yet his ambition is to make her his lawful wife. Judge how thorough∣ly I must be convinced of the im∣portance of her inclining to this offer, when I can bring myself to desire you will deliver a letter to her upon the subject; a letter, Mr. Melbank, urging her by all the
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
arguments that arise out of the case, fully contemplated, to accept the hand of another admirer: nay, more; I enjoin you, sir, as you value the the character of this charming, but injured woman, to second my elo∣quence by yours, and to suggest every thing that may incline her to a measure so auspicious to her, in every respect.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO CHARLOTTE. <HI>(Inclosed.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE lessons of Charlotte, have at length brought Charles to a real sense of right and wrong: he has deliberated upon his duty several solitary hours, and the result of the whole is a plain conviction, that his continuing to correspond with her, is highly culpable. His weakness is constantly urging him to mix with his sentiments, the expressions of love, all which serve to fan a fire, that might otherwise be consumed. Charles is at last certain, that he is doing his fair friend an injury by this
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
conduct. He is persuading her to cherish a hopless passion, and must consequently make her very unhappy. Were she left to the drift of her own prudence and wisdom, they would soon conquer a fatal flame, which is perhaps acquiring fresh force from being thus indirectly cherished. She is by these means also, kept out of those elegant circles which are so innocent, so advantageous, and so agreeable to female youth. Perhaps, if she were to go more into the world, she might meet the man whom she might yet like—whom she might honour with the name and privileges of a husband. The curse that attends Charles, may not attend another, and the advantages
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
of marriage, though, in real fact, they may not, in particular cases, contribute much to purity of <HI>heart,</HI> contribute infinitely to worldly re∣putation. Charles is become sensible of what Charlotte ought to do, should she receive advances of this honour∣able nature. As it is impossible she should act unkindly to any man, so, if any man of fortune, good temper, and good sense, should address her, it is the most serious advice of Charles, that she could indulge him with encouragement. Blinded no longer by the mists of passion, he can now see the train of desireable consequences attendant upon such a step. He sees the amiable Charlotte
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
caressed by those who before had the insolence to sneer.</P>
<P>He observes the beautiful martyr embraced by those who lately kept aloof: the very virtue and excellence, over which affected state and haughty chastity before triumphed, is now congratulated, complimented, and applauded.</P>
<P>She will, therefore, weigh these important articles, and whenever they present themselves to her ac∣ceptance, it is the hope of Charles, that she will not refuse them. That she may be tortured with no more improper sentiments, but lay such as
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
these to her heart — is the last in∣truding prayer of</P>

<P>SINCE the most fortunate circum∣stance that ever befel you, next to the <HI>marriage</HI> with my father, ('twere necessary to say that I mean his <HI>death</HI>) I have been sitting down many times, to write to you; some∣times in the ardour of an honest re∣sentment, and sometimes, as a plead∣ing, neglected child: but I have re∣mained silent, even yet, an left you uncontrouled to the luxury of your

good success, and of my anxieties. But your conscience now seems quite brought over to your side, and I can no longer suffer you to triumph, ei∣ther in the benefit of my inheritance, or in the warm and wicked comforts of a wealthy widowhood—(oh! what a robe of mourning has yours been madam) without trying upon you, the force of truth, and remonstrance: — without exerting one desperate experiment upon a heart, which ha∣bit and nature seem impregnantly to have fortified (as if it were the citadel of cruelty) against all the artillery of the parent, and of the woman!</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>The artifice and complottings, by which my destruction has been effected, are not unknown to me— How is it, Mrs. P. that you are able to reconcile to yourself, at the fore∣boding age of sixty-three, actions, of a colour so atrocious, that the penitence of your youth upwards were scarce sufficient to wipe away? by what casuistry have you pacified every private monition; and how skilful must have been that sophistry, by the magic of which, you are ca∣pable of sitting composed, at the head of a table, which you have <HI>stolen</HI> from your child? but why do I interrogate? 'tis a maxim in mo∣rality, that a bad woman has no <HI>limit</HI> to her crimes. You are gone
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
too far to recede; and I have no hope that you will mend in the progres∣sion, but expect that you must ga∣ther guilt, as you go onward to the grave, till it shall be the pleasure of providence (in mercy to <HI>me</HI> and <HI>mankind</HI>) to confine you there.</P>
<P>You accuse me to your acquaint∣ance, of wildness, and profusion! 'Tis the wretched, pitiful, pretence of guilt, of <HI>private</HI> guilt, labouring for a <HI>public apology!</HI> To lay some error to my charge, was necessary to save you from the assaults of your <HI>sex;</HI> to palliate a conduct like your's, it was <HI>indespensible,</HI> to alledge some∣thing against me; since, to have tormented a child in such a manner,
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
without some <HI>shadow</HI> of occasion, would have argued a temper too monstrous to have been ranked among women; and the very boys would, in mere vengeance, have stoned the <HI>inhuman mother.</HI> But de∣pend upon it, the sick pillow, will be to you a pillow of plagues: your bed, a bed of torture; and every feather there, will prove a thorn to torment you! Is this the language of lunacy? is it the violence of phrenzy? No, madam: faithful to the injuries of its master, this vin∣dictive hand has hitherto confined itself to sentiments of the most <HI>frigid moderation.</HI> From this moment, I cut you away from the insulted sen∣sibilities of affection: when nature dis∣cards
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
you, what claim can you have upon the heart of a son? and yet, do not think, I mean to forget you so far as to leave you to yourself. Believe me, madam, the day of such voluptuousness is past; and although you have robbed me of every right which should at least have divided with you the comforts of the world, I will henceforward take care, that you shall no more enjoy them, with∣out the heaviest tax of indignant re∣probation.</P>
<P>Your argument with my poor father was always in the same style: "I should spend his fortune." With what parental piety have you pro∣vided against this! but even grant∣ing
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
it <HI>had</HI> been so: had I not on my side the claims of nature and of blood? and what were <HI>your</HI> claims, madam? The claims of a gay, needy woman, who after having been long setting in <HI>vain,</HI> the matrimonial trap, caught in it, at last, a gentleman of property: and, by these ingenious measures, rose from the indigence of your widowhood, to the dignity of a wife, and, by surviving the second husband—en∣joyed widowhood again with all its most favourable perquisites. Con∣sider your shattered fortunes, at the time of your matriculation into my father's family.

How well you can support poverty with a full

Oh! force of feminine fraud! execrable, execrable delusion! where, where, madam, must I look for a parallel to you? not in man, surely; not in any one of your own sex, I hope, to heaven! for the Countess of Macclesfield herself, whose in∣famy, you know, is published, was merciful and maternal to you. I fear we must quit the bounds of <HI>this world,</HI> in search of the simile, and, descending into another, find your resemblance, in the father of <HI>finesse.</HI> It is recorded, you know, madam, of him, and of him <HI>only,</HI>

that he could for his purposes, as∣sume all shapes and characters; "make the worse, appear the bet∣ter cause," and sometimes rose even a minister of light to determine pre∣cisely, whether he was in reality, an angel, or a fiend. There is, however, a uniformity in your cha∣racter, not unworthy of you: to be complete in crime, is at least, more ingenious, than a half-witted, bungling villainy. You are above being content with your mere vic∣tory, in the Court of Chancery; and as the magistrate did not take care to <HI>compel</HI> you to preserve, my poor pittance in reversion, after you are gone to <HI>account,</HI> you seem resolved to delay the sale of the

But you are determined, I find, to be con∣sistent; and are, therefore, taking the only measures, which will en∣able your barbarity to survive the grave.</P>
<P>My exhausted paper warns me to quit you for the <HI>present;</HI> and I shall leave you, madam, to sup "with what appetite you may," though I am confident your relish to it would be keener, were you to

know that <HI>I</HI> have no supper to enjoy. In this important particular, how∣ever, I must disappoint you. My senses are still sufficient to the pur∣poses of common life, even though liberty is taken from me. I have frequently heard you wish, that I could neither read nor write. Pre∣resolved as you were, to drive me to a dependance on the efforts of writ∣ing and reading, I see nothing pre∣posterous in the wish. I sup∣pose then, it would give the total finish to your exultation, if it should please the omnipotent to touch the brain. The loss of my senses would, indeed, be joy to you; and I know not whether your heart would not open wide enough to purchase for

me the bells, the whip, and strait waistcoat, could you at the same time purchase the delirium, which would make such dreadful furniture necessary. But, perhaps, this may never be crouded into the catologue of my calamities: he, who feedeth the ravens, rewards, at least with bread, the efforts of an injured child. Providence will protect those, whom the parent has neglected: when the thoughtless ostrich leaves her egg under the sand, it is rescued from the violence of the wave, and is called into being, by the sun beam.

<P>OH! God of heaven, Mr. Tem∣pleton, what am I to do now? All that I felt before, was lenity to the misery in which I am at this minute involved. Poor Charles is in a prison, without money, without health, without a friend!

It was from Cleora, that I

I have not seen Dr. Melbank since I received this killing intelligence; and when I <HI>do</HI> see him, there is a certain circumstance which makes it highly improper, that I should apply to <HI>him,</HI> of all the men in the world, for relief. How, Mr. Templeton, how dreadfully is this excellent youth reduced? what a soul must he possess to write such generous letters at a crisis so de∣plorable? Perhaps he has had a re∣turn of his fever—perhaps—indeed, sir, I am almost distracted. I dare not go to him, nor can I stay away from him. Oh! these cruel debts,

<P>TO what accumulated indigni∣ties, does the want of a for∣tune expose me? Soon after I had sealed my last letter to you, I hurried on my things, and walked out into the Park, to meditate on the steps I should take in this dilemma. I had not gone more than half the length
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
of the place, before a gentleman ac∣costed me by my name, and enquired into the cause of that uneasiness, which was but too apparent. In the disorder of my heart, I told him the whole story: I soon recollected in this gentleman, one of the many who caressed Charles for his brilliant sense; and, as he had lately come to ample fortunes, I began to hope I had met the person who would assist in the necessary business. The debt, said I, is but an hundred gui∣neas: what say you? will you conde∣cend to serve a good man, whom you admire? will you <HI>exalt</HI> yourself by en∣tering a place of confinement? if so, go to him: conceal from him by what means you heard of his mis∣fortune,
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
and may the power that <HI>sees</HI> the generosity, <HI>reward</HI> it.</P>
<P>He pencil'd down my address, in order, as he said, to acquaint me what he had done, took me kindly by the hand, and bidding me be more chearful, left me. How happy was I, to see him walk briskly down the park! and, when out of sight, I was ready to drop upon my knee in gratitude to the God, who raised up to my poor Charles, so able and so amiable a protector.</P>
<P>I chearfully went home; where I had not arrived half an hour, before a servant, in a livery I recollected, brought me the following card. Oh!

<P>YES, Mr. Templeton, I will go through what I have begun, or perish in the attempt.—I am not, however, boaster enough, to pretend that my heart is serene. Oh, Sir, it is torn almost to pieces. I feel my affection for Charlotte, and my admi∣ration for Charles, increase upon me every hour. I have seen them both together, in the same room, and the struggles they had, to conceal their agitation from a third person, broke
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
through all disguises.—Never did I be∣hold such a scene—I could not support it, but withdrew, and left the lovers to themselves. Wretched as I am, I deplore the misfortune that keeps them asunder, and, though it may sound like romance, I would do much to promote their happiness. Nay, I <HI>will</HI> do every thing within my power. 'Tis, in my opinion, a base action to divide them—should Charlotte even yield to my proposals, upon a re-appli∣cation of them, what would be the con∣sequence? I should possess a woman's hand without all her heart. I should greatly add to the miseries of a man, already too much opressed.—I cannot bear the thought—I shudder at it, Mr. Templeton. No, Sir,—let me not

take an undue advantage of the cala∣mity that called me into the fa∣mily. — It cannot be —I foresee the horrors it will heap upon two pre-possessed hearts.—They labour at in∣difference, and they discover attach∣ment.—I will avoid both.—Some would smile at a man, on the wrong side of thirty, being thus conquered, by a tenderness, they would pardon only in eighteen.

<HEAD>LETTER CXV. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>MELBANK, is like one of those glorious phoenomena which awes <HI>us</HI> weaker, and more imperfect mortals, into silence. He reaches the resolution of Charlotte, and throws out of sight the fortitude and dignity of Charles. As the poet therefore says of the deity, I say of Dr. Melbank.
<Q>I lose 
<L>Myself, in him!</L>
<L>Come then, expressive <HI>silence! muse</HI> his praise.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>He is too great to talk about; let us content ourselves with <HI>thinking</HI> of him.</P>
<P>I find Charlotte, we must not in∣dulge ourselves in any more inter∣views—they are treacherous—they betray us. Let us endeavour to be contented with our usual pleasures of corresponding: let us follow strictly the advice of our friend. I am weak enough to confess to you, that I am more rejoiced at Dr. M—'s noble conquest over himself, than at any thing I ever felt since my existence. Had he married you—had he doubled my obstacles—had he taken you for ever from me—or had the cruel cer∣tainty
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
of your being wife to another attended me—God knows, how I should have supported it.</P>
<P>All his generosity—even though he had thrown his whole fortune into my lap—would have shrunk before me; and such is the inconsistence of a tender heart —although I was my∣self the proposer and promoter of the union, had it been carried into exe∣cution, I believe I should have hated him, and hang'd myself. But as it is, I could build churches, and erect monuments to his memory: he has saved me from desperation: he has made me able to bear Charlotte's ab∣sence. While I know that she is not connected with another, I can bear to
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
live without her society. I am happy to hear constantly that she is well, that she attends to her intellectual im∣provements—that she will often read my letters, and employ herself in the innocent task of writing answers. All these things were, I own, very lately, considered as too little—but adversity brings us to a proper sense of rational blessings; and the prospect of ever∣lastingly losing the tenderness of Char∣lotte, has made me satisfied with <HI>that,</HI> which at present <HI>ought</HI> to satisfy me. My situation indeed, appears, upon reflection, to be much more support∣able, than I at first imagined! how much severer might it have been rendered, by either your marriage or your death! let me endeavour to
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
procure comfort from comparison. We are both happier than thousands —I have at this minute an instance in my eye to justify this, and, as I am sure it will serve to make us both more reconciled, I will, in my next letter, communicate it to you,</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXVI.</HI> From the same to the same.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was at the house of the sheriffs officer, Charlotte, an adventure struck me so forcibly that it would be barbarous to refuse
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
(to so tender a heart as your's) the recital of it; especially as it will shew you, that there are agonies in life, compared to which, <HI>ours</HI> are transient and trifling. In mourning our own calamities and disappoint∣ments, let us not too selfishly forget the calamity of <HI>others;</HI> but where (as in the <HI>following</HI> case) we see wretched∣ness <HI>exceeding</HI> our own, let us re∣member, that, not to be the <HI>most</HI> miserable, is at least one source of contentment; and instead of mur∣muring, we ought to sympathize.</P>
<P>Soon after I was arrested by Mr. Trap, and conveyed to his house, I beheld a young man sitting in a very pensive posture, resting his cheek up∣on
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
one hand, and holding a pen in the other. He was not at all dis∣concerted at my being brought in, but smothered the sighs as well as he was able, and began to write. "There's more stuff in the office, master, said a fellow that now en∣tered the room—there's two or three more of the <HI>roe</HI> and <HI>doe</HI> family come to visit you—it is a sad thing to be sure, but, <HI>howsomdever,</HI> you shall not go over the water to-night; you are every inch a <HI>Gemmun,</HI> I will say that, and you spend your money like a prince. No, no, God forbid I should carry any <HI>Gemmun</HI> out of my house while he behaves as such; so sit still, for you shan't go to jail till to-morrow."</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158"/>Upon this Charlotte, the poor young man looked up, discovered his eyes swimming in tears, drew a handkerchief out of his pocket, and put it over his face.</P>
<P>Having a little recovered himself, he took up the pen again, and just as he was applying it to the paper, his features assumed something of consolation: but this again, was pre∣sently dashed by the appearance of the bailiff's wife, although, to do her justice, she was a very obliging woman.</P>
<P>There are some messages, you know, so displeasing in their own nature, or at least rendered
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
so by the peculiar circumstances which introduce them, that they would seem disgusting, though they were to be delivered by the lips of the graces.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trap therefore, was as gra∣cious as it is possible for any one to be, who presents a <HI>bill</HI> that requires to be discharged on the spot. Her harangue was to the following ef∣fect.</P>
<P>She was very sorry to trouble him, but it was a <HI>rule.</HI> It made all things, on all sides easy:—scores, were scores; short reckonings made long friend∣ships—gentlemen were here to-day, and gone to-morrow; and therefore
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
she hoped he would not be offended at the customs of the house.</P>
<P>Here, Charlotte, the prisoner took his hand from his pocket, from whence flew one solitary guinea, and he protested to God, that if the fifti∣eth part of that sum <HI>more,</HI> would purchase him a passport to paradise, he could not raise it.</P>
<P>I was, soon after this declaration, left alone with my fellow prisoner, who, still preserving an air of dejec∣tion, addressed me, as you will find it recited in my next letter.</P>

<P>WHY should you despair, sir, said I? because, replied Mr. Reynolds, my condition is on all sides desperate: besides that I have no money, I have no friends to procure it, nor any means or health to ac∣quire it by: <HI>you,</HI> sir, are, no doubt, brought here by some misfortune, but God forbid you should match in misery the most unhappy man that is now speaking.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162"/>Poor as I was Charlotte, and des∣titute both of fortune and happiness, I put my hand into my purse, which being perceived by Reynolds, he waved his hand in token of disappro∣bation, and, with swimming eyes, ex∣claimed, pray take your hand from your purse, sir—I beseech you to take it away—I am resign'd—I bow me to the burden of my fortunes—money cannot, you know, Sir, medicine to a mind diseased—not the fortune of the East collected, could restore me to my tranquility.</P>
<P>I beg, Mr. Reynolds, said I, that we may pass the remainder of our
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
evening together without interrup∣tion: as we are united by a similar misfortune let us make it a social one. My fate, like yours, is not to be al∣leviated by money, yet let us, for this one night, live in the hope that the morning may bring comfort on her wings.</P>
<P>You are very polite, and propose what would be extremely agreeable, Sir, said Mr. Reynolds—but really— really—I—I—I—.</P>
<P>Here Charlotte, he began to re∣examine, and shake his pockets.</P>
<P>Oh fie, fie Sir, said I.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="164"/>I went out, and ordered (agree∣ble to the slender state of my finan∣ces, and with a prudent recollection of the charges of the house) a com∣fortable supper. At my return, poor Mr. Reynolds was weeping over a letter, that, by the evidence of seve∣ral places much worn, and a variety of foldings, appeared to have been the frequent subject of dear and soli∣tary meditation. After he had read it, he pressed it to his heart, and kissed it; he looked steadily at me, and, think∣ing the sentiments would speak best for themselves, put it into my hand, without uttering a syllable.</P>
<P>As I know, my lovely correspond∣ent Charlotte, does not possess a heart
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
like that invulnerable piece of rock which lies putrifying in the bosom of Mr. Timothy Trap; as I know, on the contrary, she can pity the sor∣rows that even surpass her own, I will oblige her with a transcript of of the contents of the letter, which the prisoner trusted to my perusal.</P>

that interval, as well as I am able, in imparting to you some senti∣ments that you ought to know.</P>
<P>Your late miseries, oh my dear James, went too near my heart, and the day that your furniture and even our bed was last seized, I had the rashness to take poison—a poison my husband, which, though very slow, is certain in its operations.

<P>How, James, can I sustain the sense of my guilt? instead of dying, I should have lived, on purpose to

</LETTER>
<P>I shed, my Charlotte, over this epistle, the tears of sensibility: it was written in a faint hand, the words scarce legible, and every syllable spoke the disorder of the unfortunate writer. When I returned it to Mr. Reynolds he kissed it as before, fold∣ed it up as a miser would have folded a bank bill of a thousand pounds, surveyed it on all sides with the great∣est
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
tenderness, and then deposited it in a little box of ebony.</P>
<P>So heaven befriend me Sir, said he, as he put up the box, I would not part with this to be restored to all the fortune I had a right to inherit. No barbarous mother! no, inhuman parent, <HI>this</HI> you cannot take from me: of this inestimable relique you cannot rob me: this is a treasure your child can call his own, in defiance of all your artifices. I thank the great and good God, for the blessing—oh that I could find an honest man who would lay it upon my bosom when I enter the grave, for which I have long most pathetically petitioned.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169"/>Mr. Reynolds, said I, you see that friend now before, you, should I survive, and if not, I would recom∣mend that office to a dear and faith∣ful woman who would not neglect it.</P>
<P>I had scarce finished this promise, before Reynolds was upon his knees, and gave me, as he rose, with his hands clasping mine, such a look of acknowledgment, that I felt enter into my heart.</P>
<P>And is there then, said I, is there another Mrs. P.—and was there ever another Charlotte? did Mr. Reynolds call the one his wife, and and the other his mother? if so— you have still reason to be contented
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
Mr. Reynolds: the blessed society of such a wife, is more than a balance for the curses, keen as they are, of such a mother.</P>
<P>Blessed society, returned Mr. Rey∣nolds, yes, Sir, <HI>her's was</HI> a blessed society: horrible as was the death she died, the life she lived might atone even for the crime of self destruction. She was eleven years Sir by my side, during which time we were never in prosperity, and yet—such was the charm that mutually bound us—we threw adversity into despair—she <HI>was</HI> my wife upon earth—she <HI>is</HI> an angel in heaven. If you Sir have got the counterpart of her, do not talk of pains, or prisons, or penalties—if
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
there is not something wrong in your heart—it must be happy.</P>
<P>Upon this, Charlotte, I ran over the heads of my history, at which even with the softness of a Desdemona, he wept particularly at such parts as re∣lated to my mother's barbarity, and my Charlotte's kindness—(I did not men∣tion Cleora by name) and, after I
<Q>He gave me for my pains a world of sighs</Q>
had ended, he promised to reward me with a scene or two from his own disasterous volume.</P>

<P>Mr. Reynold's sat down, and be∣gan. The continuation of his nar∣rative ran thus.</P>
<P>I shall begin this part of my his∣tory at the day I obtained, after vari∣ous delightful difficulties, the hand of my beloved Lucia, who, being only a farmer's daughter, was con∣sidered by my mother (who can match your's for cruelty) as an intruder in the family, and therefore took every opportunity to insult her. This contemptuous treatment made us resolve to leave her house, and ra∣ther
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
earn our bread by daily labour, than be indebted for it to one who was constantly upbraiding us for the bounty. As I was not bred to any business, I was obliged to seek for such an employment, as depended rather on the application and ver∣satility of genius, than any thing else. Having a well grounded classical education, and a sprightly vein for undetached compositions, I was ad∣vised, by a young friend who knew the town, to apply to the booksellers, and endeavour to get a livelihood from the pursuits of the press; while my poor Lucia was to throw in her mite, by attending to the needle. With these views, and only three guineas and a half in our pockets, we

left this cruel mother's house one evening pretty late, (taking advant∣age of her absence from home) and set out to a neighbouring town, from whence we embarked in a waggon for London. Upon our arrival there, we called on our young metropolitan friend, who agreed the next morning to attend me to a printer of his ac∣quaintance: we soon, through his assistance, produced a lodging, and, for the sake of literary convenience, it was in a small court, that led into Paternoster-row.</P>
<P>Upon going into the printer's shop the master surveyed me critically, and without any previous, or delicate ce∣remony, asked (as soon as he under∣stood
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
my business—) what I could <HI>do?</HI> whether I had any <HI>specimens</HI> about me? whether I was a <HI>verse-man,</HI> or a <HI>prose-man?</HI> whether I had ever dab∣bled, in those doings, or was only go∣ing to throw my ink about the world?</P>
<P>My friend answered for me, that, I was a young man of genius who could turn my hand to any thing, that I would enter into immediate employ; and that my diligence might be de∣pended on.</P>
<P>As authorship was thus early the necessary means of eating and drink∣ing, it was not to be supposed I had much time to bestow upon the elegancies of composition; upon po∣lishing
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
my periods, arranging my arguments, or decorating my senti∣ments: good, or good for nothing, so many pages were to produce so many pence, and therefore the main point was, to have the pen almost always in my hand, and scribble away, for the <HI>supplies of the day.</HI> Ge∣nerally speaking, however, my task-masters, the booksellers, cut out my business, and told me <HI>what,</HI> and <HI>how much</HI> would be wanting that night.</P>
<P>If, as it is asserted, there be uni∣versal charms in variety; never ought man to be more contented, or think himself more entertained than myself; for I have often wrote round the whole circle of the sciences in twenty
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
four hours.—I purchased my break∣fast by a page of politics—my din∣ner by a sheet of biography—my tea by history—my supper by a poem on the pleasures of the spring, and my lodging (which I shifted nearly as often as my subjects, and much oftner than my linen) by divinity. The next day came into play for the morning, a slice of mathematics—for noon, a plate of translation, and for the even∣ing, a dish of indexes. My employ∣ers, sir, notwithstanding this labour of Hercules, made woeful complaints that my works did not sell, that they did not pay for paper and print—that <HI>I was not known:</HI> that unless I could get a popular writer to lend me his
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
<HI>name,</HI> they must decrease the copy-money.</P>
<P>About this time poor Lucia's wardrobe began to decline, though her lovely face was ever dressed in smiles of congratulation, or in tears of sympathy—my own apparel began to be truly literary, and I recollected to have often seen one of my book∣sellers, whose name was Meadowes, slide about his shop in the mornings, till after hair dressing time, in a green frock. We were both of a size, and I made formal proposals—this very frock Sir cost me a whole octavo vo∣lume of sermons, which were printed the following month▪ under the tak∣ing title of sermons, by a late right
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
reverend prelate, warranted originals, and to be seen by the curious in his lordship's own hand writing. While I was labouring for the coat, I had no other wages till I had earned that, than what I could get by working after stated hours: and yet it was ab∣solutely necessary for me and my wife to subsist in the interim: accord∣ingly I sat up for two nights together, and wrote a large poem of the 1s. 6d. size, on conjugal tenderness, entitled the <HI>faithful pair.</HI> I hurried away with this the next morning to a new purchaser, who said if I would leave it ten days or a fortnight, he would give me his answer. This proposal, not suiting the situation of affairs at home, I went to a second dealer in
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
these wares, who having looked at the title said, he had made an oath never to burn his fingers against the blaze of <HI>poetry</HI> any more; a third observed, that he would sell me a parcel of poems by the pound—and a fourth hinted, that if I would take the opposite side of the subject, and write in support of conjugal infidelity, he would treat with me.</P>
<P>Chagrined, wounded, desolate, and disgusted, I went into a pawnbroker's shop, and pledged a pocket-piece of silver, upon which—the value being four shillings—they lent me two and twenty pence; with this modicum I bought a few necessaries, and ran to offer them to the half-starved, but
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
still uncomplaining Lucia. In her dear company I forgot every indig∣nity, and every care, and we passed the whole evening over a mutton chop, and a pot of porter, with joy, content, and tenderness inexpres∣sible.</P>
<P>The next morning, an hour before the time of going to work, I thought something agreeable might happen from trying the heart of Mr. Mea∣dows; and setting myself seriously down to the task, while Lucia was asleep, I thus addressed the feel∣ings of a Bookseller.</P>

<P>Upon the receipt of this audacious letter, I thought my reason would have left me. I threatened venge∣ance
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
on the barbarous writer. Oh Sir, hear the circumstances that at∣tended it. I had many misfortunes, and many debts upon me. I dared not venture abroad till the shades of the night befriended me. I sold the la∣bours of my pen to this fellow, on his own terms, and I had entrusted him with the knowledge of my abode that I might correct what are called the proof sheets, as they come from the press: the wretch knew at what an advantage he took me, and that he might say almost any thing with impunity. But, oh Sir, what villany could exceed his insult at such a time —by a fellow too with whom I had scrupulously fulfilled every engage∣ment, and who knew not a syllable
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
of me or of my affairs, but from the vague breath of partial or vulgar re∣port.</P>
<P>I did not however, answer his im∣pudent letter, but crushed it in my hand, and to prevent its being seen by the too cruel and sympathizing Lucia, threw it into the fire.</P>
<P>Disdaining to work any more in the service of Meadows, I sought out a new talk-master; I left the manage∣ment of the remainder of the two and twenty pence to Lucia, and began my search. I at length made myself known to one, little celebrated, but very busy, and was directly to begin a new <HI>family bible,</HI> by a certain Dean
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
and a society of clergymen—my new master had just dined, and as the cloth was removing, I suppose he saw me look somewhat wishingly. He was very much addicted to wit, and thus facetiously began to interrogate.</P>
<P>"What, I warrant me now, you <HI>eat</HI> as well as I—that is, begging your pardon, you would if you could! ten to one but you <HI>drink</HI> too—eh? what a pity it is you <HI>scribere-cum-dasho</HI> gen∣try should be pestered with those plaguy passions, and hankerings after meat, drink and cloathing.

Damme master author, I am better than a father to you, even before you have written a single syllable.</P>
<P>Better than a <HI>mother</HI> Sir, said I, you assuredly are; and then the tears
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
sprang into my foolish eyes, as I com∣pared the delicate dinner that I sup∣posed she then might be eating, to the bare bones, stale pudding, coppery broth, and broken bread, that Susan was now going to place before me. However, as I was never quite so hungry since I was born, and as I knew my ever dear Lucia had suffi∣cient for a frugal meal, I never eat a more hearty meal, or blessed heaven with more sincerity, that a meal (though coarse) was bestowed at all.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXI. <HI>From the same to the same.</HI> The history of Mr. Reynolds con∣cluded.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN supper was over, and I had persuaded Mr. Rey∣nolds to drink a glass of wine, he proceeded in this manner.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198"/>In the midst of this literary labour and indigence, a relation of Lucia's died, and bequeathed her the sum of two hundred pounds. This was a delicious windfall, and I received it in bank bills a month after the per∣sons decease: violent, and immediate transitions however, are undesirable and dangerous: the leap, from po∣verty to plenty is truly alarming, and many a man's head turns giddy in making it. Such was the present case. I had no sooner got this pre∣cious treasure in my hands, than I gave a loose to imagination. As it was Lucia's money, I could not bear the idea of using it for <HI>my</HI> purposes. I considered the poor hut in which that excellent creature resided, as un∣worthy
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
such an inhabitant, and there∣fore, immediately, and unknown to her, I took two little neat apartments, and furnished them to—what I knew to be her taste—I reflected upon the forlorn state of her wardrobe, and I repaired it by silks, laces, linens, &amp;c. to the amount of almost one of the hundred pounds — with these pur∣chases, which I made from time to time in the course of the first week, I, at a proper period, made Lucia ac∣quainted, and the dear creature Sir was almost ready to faint at the tid∣ings. She saw the conjugal delicacy and disinterestedness of my intentions, but she saw also the imprudence of laying out all our little property, in finery, that was wholly inconsistent
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
with our embarrassed state, and our future expectation. Luckily, how∣ever, my furniture was second hand, and I had eighteen guineas still in my possession: we therefore agreed to manage this with the utmost frugality, till I could supply myself by writing some work, that, by tak∣ing time and pains with it, might be likely to establish my reputation as an author; after which, according to the trite expression, a man may lie a bed. In pursuance of these oeconomi∣cal resolutions, I had fixed upon my subject, sketched out the plan of my design, entered upon the introduc∣tory parts, and began to kindle in the progress; when, lo! I had not, with all my foresight, provided against
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
certain demands which various trades-people had on their books against me, for former necessaries.</P>
<P>One evening, after I had laid aside the pen, in order to enjoy the sweets of a conversation never tedious, and always tender; just as Lucia began to entertain me with a favourite song, a man came into our apartment and presented a bill for thirty-seven pounds, which had been owing him, and collecting to that size, for up∣wards of two years. Startled as I was, I hardly knew, how to stammer forth an apology, and the creditor perceiving my confusion took it as a token of my distress, and was <HI>therefore</HI> resolved to have his money on the spot. I equi∣vocated.
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
He left me abruptly, and, with the authority of a creditor, slapt to my dining-room door with a shew of indignation. Our song, and all our harmony, you may be sure, was now broken, and we were left to many sorrowful reflections.</P>
<P>Our affection, however Sir, was of so delicate a nature, that all the ar∣dours of romance were realized in my conduct, and even pastoral senti∣ments scarce did justice, to the ten∣derness of my passion.</P>
<P>Nature had formed her for emi∣nence, and such was her mind, that she bore with me the burden of anxi∣ety, and doubled the sense of better
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
fortune, at the time that she shared it. But the great charm which en∣deared and distinguished her, was, that fervid fortitude, that gave her strength (even after the bed was torn from under her) to go through the most piercing inconvenience, and the hardest trials. The insults <HI>I</HI> sustained however, were too much for her, and she grew quite melancholy, and would sometimes pass whole days without being able to utter a word— at last the hour approached when all the miseries of my existence were to be collected to a point—when for∣tune, piqued at my former defiance of her, by one decisive blow—the moment at last came—which—which —you know the rest, Sir —spare—

<P>NOW Sir, indeed, my misery is compleated—I have had ano∣ther interview with Charlotte, in the presence of Charles—a stranger was there—oh, Mr. Templeton, <HI>such</HI> a stranger: upon his coming into the
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
room, I was greatly struck with the resemblance of features which I shall never forget. At dinner, Charles drank to his health, under the name of Mr. Reynolds—I no sooner heard the sound, than my heart ceased to beat — I felt a mixture of inex∣pressible misery, and fell back in my chair. They officiously recovered me to greater misery — whom do you think sat opposite to me, Sir?—the only man in the world that I had in∣jured—the nephew of that very Mr. Reynolds, who was the father of my Maria, and who, but for some petty offence—some partial misrepresenta∣tions, was to have heired the for∣tunes that were given to me. Rey∣nolds, Sir, said I—are those features,
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
the exact image of Mr. Stokes, the property of Mr. Reynolds—of the very person who is now before me? Mr. Stokes, Sir, replied he, was my uncle, the brother of my mother— but I was, when very young, most falsely painted to him, and never saw him afterwards: he had a daughter then at a boarding school.</P>
<P>He <HI>had</HI> so, Sir, said I, almost sob∣bing, and that daughter's name was—</P>
<P>Maria Stokes, said he—</P>
<P>And that Maria Stokes, rejoined I, was <HI>my wife</HI>—and she is—</P>
<P>Where said Mr. Reynolds?</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="213"/>With the God that made her— but is it possible, resumed I, that <HI>you</HI> should be this very Mr. Reynolds, —where have you been: by what means have you eluded my most in∣dustrious enquiries—I have been bu∣ried, Sir, he returned, amongst the booksellers—I have been condemned under fifty names, to conceal from the gripe of the creditor a wretched body not worth the fatigue of a single search —I have never shewn my face—or applied by letters to those who basely deserted me—I have hid myself in the thickness of a thousand disguises —and, in short Sir, my kind bene∣factor who sits next to me will explain the rest.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214"/>Upon this Mr. Templeton, Charles withdrew a moment with Charlotte, and on their return, put a packet of letters into my hand, containing— what do you think Sir?—nothing less than the <HI>history of Mr. Reynold's.</HI>— I have borrowed these letters, Sir, and now send them in franks for your reading—look into them Sir with an eye of compassion.—</P>
<P>When I had finished this perusal of them, I made use of the little strength I had left, to fall upon my knee—I took Mr. Reynolds's hand; and so Sir, said I—I have at last found out the unhappy gentleman, whose natural expectations I have despoiled—why did you not leave
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
some clue to your residence, before the death of your uncle, — I was only a servant in his family—I did not even know, at that time, that he had a nephew in being—I —I—in a word Sir, as this lady has furnished me with your narrative—she will be so kind to give you a sketch of mine— in the mean while let me retire into another room—I cannot support it any longer without relief.</P>

<P>"We have both had our misfor∣tunes, Sir, said he—but I can see no trace of guilt in your conduct. As to my uncle, I had long buried my

<P>I Have at length brought myself to be really sorry, you and Charles, cannot be properly re-united. As I now see that the circumstances which happened <HI>prior</HI> to, and <HI>since</HI> our se∣paration, would render a re-union intolerably <HI>imperfect;</HI> and as <HI>you</HI> are evidently the woman of his choice, I am willing to enter into articles of mutual release, and try how far it is possible for your return to Charles to

<P>In regard to any difference in our tempers, and disagreement in <HI>other</HI> respects, we have both smarted for <HI>them</HI> sufficiently, without dragging in∣to the account the most barbarous report that ever was invented to de∣stroy the fame of a woman.

<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
as much the advances to so unprofit∣able a reconciliation as himself—<HI>we were never comfortable</HI>—at least we were never fond after the first month —I was dupe enough to listen to a love-tale made by a man upon the bachelor's ramble, under a fictitious name—every step we both took was romantic; and had I not been as much besotted with a wild, mad-headed scheme as himself, I might have seen <HI>prudence,</HI> without going to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles and Cleora were married in that King∣dom</NOTE> Scotland for <HI>repentance.</HI> But the deed is done, and I wish with all my heart it were <HI>undone.</HI> How <HI>can</HI> you madam, believe Charles a <HI>constant</HI> man?—can it be possible he should

You say, he will, after he has come to some terms with his creditors, contribute to my genteeler support. He writes me word he will also assist me in a proper provision for the child.—</P>
<P>If he fulfills these promises, hea∣ven knows, I never desire a closer intercourse with him, and I have resolved in my mind to mark this as the last letter he shall ever see, or Charlotte ever receive on the subject: for, to tell you the truth I do not

<HEAD>LETTER CXXIII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>ALAS Charlotte, I have been witness to another scene more tender, even than the first: Rey∣nolds and Melbank were an hour together, without the intrusions of a third person; and when I joined
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
them, they were tenderly locked in embraces: the poor doctor is ex∣ceedingly ill, and we both sat by his bed-side all night. About twelve o'clock this morning he fell into a short slumber, and Reynolds went to bed. I begin, indeed, now Char∣lotte, to consider <HI>our</HI> pangs of sepa∣ration as trifling, in opposition to what I have lately heard, and lately seen. Dr. M—mentioned <HI>you</HI> several times in the course of the night with the greatest marks of re∣spect—kissed the picture of the de∣ceased Maria—wept again over the fate of Lucia—pitied Charles—and bathed the hands of Mr. Reynolds in tears.—I shall return to him again, as soon as I have put a wafer under
<PB N="228" REF="230"/>
<HI>this,</HI> for the satisfaction of the sympa∣thizing Charlotte.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXIV. Dr. MELBANK to H. T. ESQ;</HEAD>
<P>I Am held up in my bed—and I have past the night in a fever— do not think me superstitious if I say —if I prophecy—that this will be the last time you will receive a letter from me. Poor Reynolds's situation teras me one way, and my affection

for Charlotte another—I love her yet Sir—yes Mr. Templeton, guilty as I know myself—God knows I love her yet—I have the killing cir∣cumstances too, of having Charles constantly before me, and exerting himself more indefatigably than my nurse—his hand is often in mine— he smoothes my bed-cloaths—he of∣fers me medicines—he keeps a death-like silence in the room—he most tenderly avoids speaking of Charlotte —I am afraid he still suspects my lurking passion. What can possibly have made me thus weak! I am a child—I am a child Mr. Templeton —may God bless you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXXV. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE. <HI>Twelve o'Clock at Night.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE doctor is quite delirious, Charlotte—he cries out by fits —and enquires for Mr. Reynolds— Mr. Reynolds appears, and he bids him avoid his presence. Before his fever had reduced him to this state, he sat up in his night gown, and or∣dered the lawyer to come to his bed-side—he waved us out of the room smilingly—the servants were called as witnesses—a will was made—we
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
re-entered, and he placed us both on different sides of his bed. "I am afraid, dear friends, said he, I have suffered from visiting lately a poor woman in the Fleet prison—I have reason to think the fever she has since idied of is of the contagious kind— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll as I was, I visited her on the very evening after I had found the long lost Mr. Reynolds—my spirits were then very bad.—"</P>
<P>"I desire you will take the bare pos∣sibility of it for granted—I must not suffer you to enter my chamber again my friends, till I am better—when I am certain as to the nature of my dis∣order, you shall be again with joy ad∣mitted: till then—farewell—farewell."</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="234"/>The doctor pressed our hands very softly—desired us to wash the fingers in hungary water—and then threw the sheet over his face. Touched at the solemnly affecting manner, in which he spoke, Reynolds and I withdrew, and have not dared to enter against his express inhibitions since.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY excellent master is amongst the angels: he departed this life in the forest miseries of a putrid fever, this morning a little after day break. He was sensible to every thing, and knew every body about him, about two hours before he left the world. The names of Charles, Mr. Reynolds, and one or two more, were several times repeated: he clasped his hands together, and em∣ployed his last breath in blessing you
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
all. After this he turned upon his pillow, and (though he exhibited the greatest signs of pain) remained speechless till he expired.</P>
<P>I was with him all the time—I am not afraid of catching any bad sick∣ness in performing my duty to the best man, and the best master that ever lived—God Almighty knows best, in such cases what to <HI>do:</HI> but I am sure he could not be pleased if I like the rest of the servants, had ne∣glected so worthy a gentleman in such a situation; and I shall ever honour you Sir, for the courage your friendship gave you to come and look at the good doctor, when other peo∣ple run away from him. I have
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
been nineteen years his servant, Sir, on and off, and he has many times saved my life—I certainly shall not now leave him, while he is upon the earth; and yet the physician says he must be put into the ground di∣rectly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER CXXX. CHARLES</HI> to <HI>H. T. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>THE large packet of letters that I send you, will at once apologize and account for my long silence. Neither, Charlotte, Mr. Rey∣nolds, or your friend, have of late been able to take up the pen. It was this day month, that the body of our most worthy benefactor was committed to the earth—I do most truly assure you, that the affluence in which his unequalled generosity has left me, by no means compensate
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
the pleasure I had in his society, and the satisfaction I received from his life.</P>
<P>He has divided the bulk of his fortunes amongst three persons, my Templeton, who certainly could form no possible expectation of his bounty. Here follows a faithful extract from his will.</P>
<P>—"<HI>Item,</HI> To my beloved friend Charles, I bequeath my dwel∣ling-house in St. James's-street, with all its furniture, plate, &amp;c. &amp;c."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to Charlotte, in testimony of my esteem for her vir∣tue, and reverence for her misfor∣tunes,
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds, to be paid imme∣diately on my decease, or as soon afterwards as the said sum can be conveniently drawn from the funds, where lie certain monies mentioned in other parts of this my last testi∣ment."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath, to my servant James Spedman one hundred pounds sterling."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> To Charles, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> I be∣queath one thousand pounds, for the use of Cleora, to be paid out of my cash, now lying, and being in the funds."</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247"/>"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to the said Charles, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> my Sussex estate, sub∣jected to the yearly rent of two hun-pounds, to be paid into the hands of J. Reynolds, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which is a debt due to the said J. Reynolds, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for many years."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> To the aforesaid J. Rey∣nolds, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in consideration of in∣terest on the said debt, my houses, lands, and properties, whatsoever, and wheresoever, lying and being in the island of Jamaica."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I bequeath to Charlotte all my pictures in my library, with all my books, paintings, and the miniature of my dear wife Maria,
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
hanging over the library chimney piece."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I charge the said Sussex estate, given to Charles, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with the annual deduction of one hundred pounds, to be paid to Charlotte during her natural life, on every eighteenth day of August, being the anniversary of that lady's birth."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath to H. Templeton, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one hundred gui∣neas for a mourning ring, and any other testimonies of friendship that he may choose to employ it in."</P>
<P>"<HI>Item,</HI> I give and bequeath, to Charlotte, the watch, and some
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
trinkets lying in a little gold box in my front parlour drawers, also my old and favourite dog Pompey, with an annuity of five pounds during his natural life, to be paid out of the Sussex estate, over and above the annuity of one hundred pounds."</P>
<P>Can any words, oh my dear Tem∣pleton, be adequate to such circum∣stances—and yet there is not a single person concerned who would not ra∣ther enjoy the dear company of the testator, than the splendid evidences of his tenderness and attention.</P>
<P>And then to die, as he did, in the meridian of life—in a situation so pathetic, at a time so delicately criti∣cal!
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
Blessed, for ever blessed be his memory upon earth — Rich and abundant be his rewards in Heaven. Never did I see such genuine, un∣affected grief and gratitude that mix themselves in the sympathy of Char∣lotte and Mr. Reynolds.—</P>
<P>Cleora's letter also upon the sub∣ject, does her honour.—</P>
<P>Reynolds and I, live at present in the good doctor's house; and we are so often reminded of his image, and his goodness, in every thing about us, that it is not in the power of gold to charm our grief—</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="251"/>That I have still a sigh for Char∣lotte, is but too certain, and I would most willingly reject all that I am now worth, and, after all deductions, that will, I find, be a considerable fortune—Yes, Templeton, I would yield up every shilling—be again in∣volved —again a prisoner — again liable to all the insults of an unfor∣tunate man—and depend for the re∣mainder of my days upon the pre∣carious efforts of my own hands— had I this minute the privilege of of leading her by the hand to the foot of the altar—</P>
<P>I conjure you to come to town, and let us, in the first place do justice to
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
our benefactor, by erecting to his memory a suitable monument; and let us inscribe on it such sentiments, as express our grief and our grati∣tude in the most lively manner.</P>
