<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the following Tragedy, has, in his former attempts of the same kind, avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface. His chief reason for declining this common mode of appearing before the public, was the necessity, which it would lay him under, of speaking concerning himself and his works. The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan; and to break that silence, which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even ungrateful, to those, from whom he in a great measure derives his success.</P>
<P>He embraces with pleasure, this occasion, to acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of the theatre, whose friendly, anxious, and active zeal he hath so often experienced: TO THE PER∣FORMERS, who have so strenuously contended with each other, in their very generous endeavours to embellish the representation of the piece: To MRS. BARRY—but the public voice has exalted HER above his praise: Yet he claims the merit of
<PB REF="4"/>having, before others, observed her now allowed and unrivalled excellency. From the colour of the dawn, he foretold the brightness of the day.</P>
<P>For MRS. BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi∣sinda, and the most flattering circumstance to him, in the success of his play, is the universal opinion, (vouched, not only by the loudest applause that ever shook the stage, but by the greatest effusion of tears) that the ACTRESS so much exalted THE CHARACTER, that she exceeded all imagination, and reached the summit of perfection.</P>

<L>The Prompter gives the Sign, and down they go;</L>
<L>Alive descending to the Shades below.</L>
<L>To you whose Empire still may Heav'n maintain,</L>
<L>Who here by antient Right and Custom reign,</L>
<L>Our Lions couch, our Dragons prostrate fall,</L>
<L>Witches and Ghosts obey your potent Call.</L>

<L>Against the sallies of a rash despair,</L>
<L>Against the weakness which attends surprise,</L>
<L>I have forecast whatever may befall,</L>
<L>And fram'd to the event my firm resolve.</L>
<L>This is the day appointed for the combat,</L>

<L>Antient times,</L>

<L>I am the victor's prize—whoe'er prevails</L>
<L>He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.</L>
<L>Such is the solemn treaty, sworn, confirm'd,</L>
<L>By every rite, which either nation owns.</L>
<L>Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife—</L>
<L>I am a mother—by the false Alonzo,</L>
<L>Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,</L>
<L>Which he alone can save. No other arm</L>
<L>Can match Mirmallon's force. Proud of his strength</L>
<L>Already in the lists the Moor exults,</L>
<L>Secure of victory. The setting sun</L>
<L>Concludes the dreadful period of suspence,</L>

<SPEAKER>ORMISINDA.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have no hope!</L>
<L>Review the story of my life, Teresa,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="11"/>And by the past conjecture of the future.</L>
<L>First my lamented brother, blindly led</L>
<L>By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,</L>
<L>Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell.</L>
<L>For that offence to banishment condemn'd,</L>
<L>Alonzo won me to accept his hand</L>
<L>Before he left this kingdom. Since that time,</L>
<L>What I have suffer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell.</L>
<L>It was the fifth, a memorable day,</L>
<L>After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,</L>
<L>At the appointed place to meet his bride.</L>
<L>Then' midst my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,</L>
<L>For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,</L>
<L>Could keep him from my arms, amaz'd I heard</L>
<L>That he was gone for Asia. To this hour,</L>
<L>Ev'n to this present hour, no cause assign'd</L>
<L>But these distracted lines long after sent:</L>
<L>"Thou never shalt behold Alonzo more;</L>
<L>"The foul, foul cause thy guilty conscience knows."</L>
<L>My conscience knows no cause, so help me Heav'n!</L>
<L>Now, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,</L>
<L>When I must struggle with despair and Death,</L>
<L>To keep myself a chaste, a blameless wife,</L>
<L>And to my silent grave the secret bear,</L>
<L>That my dear son and his may live to wield</L>

<L>His ears, his eyes are shut. Oft' have I sent</L>

<SPEAKER>TERESA.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Tis very strange,</L>
<L>And much unlike the way of other men.</L>
<L>For tho' they are inconstant in their love,</L>
<L>There is a course and process in the change.</L>
<L>Ardent at first, their ardor lasts not long.</L>
<L>With easy, full, secure possession cloy'd,</L>
<L>Their passion palls, and cold indifference comes,</L>
<L>As chilly autumn steals on summer's prime,</L>
<L>Making the green leaf yellow. Then it is</L>
<L>That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,</L>
<L>And fires their fancy with untasted charms.</L>
<L>But in a moment, from excess of love,</L>
<L>To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd</L>
<L>Without a cause. Nor did another come</L>
<L>Between thee and the current of his love.</L>
<L>'Tis moon-struck madness, or the dire effect</L>
<L>Of incantation, charm, compulsive spell,</L>
<L>By magie fasten'd on his wretched soul.</L>
<L>It can be nothing else.</L>

<L>Whate'er it is,</L>
<L>He shuns all woman-kind. His life is spent</L>
<L>In war and in devotion. When the field</L>
<L>Is won, the warrior lays aside his spear,</L>
<L>Takes up the pilgrim's staff, and all alone,</L>
<L>Obscur'd in homely weeds, he bends his course</L>
<L>To some remote, religious, holy place,</L>
<L>Where he exceeds the strictest penitent,</L>
<L>In penances severe and sad austerity.</L>
<L>Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt</L>
<L>He loaths the sight of man, and to the cliffs</L>
<L>Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies,</L>
<L>Where all the dreary winterhe remains,</L>
<L>And, desolate, delights in desolation.</L>
<L>My faithful fervant Juan saw him once</L>
<L>Upon the ledge of Atlas; on a rock</L>
<L>Beside the empty channel of a brook,</L>
<L>He stood and gaz'd intent a cataract</L>
<L>Which, as it tumbled from a cliff, the blast</L>
<L>Had caught mid-way, and froze before it fell.</L>
<L>Juan drew near and call'd. He turn'd about,</L>
<L>Look'd at him for a space, then wav'd him back,</L>
<L>And mounting swiftly sunk behind the hill.</L>
<L>Wan was his face, and like a statue pale!</L>

<L>Acquaints me that a champion is at hand,</L>

<L>Called the Catholic, who reign'd in Spain</L>
<L>Before the first invasion of the Moors.</L>
<L>Lost in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid</L>

<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>HAMET, impartial justice shall be done,</L>

<L>Thou art the friend of peace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAMET.</SPEAKER>
<L>Therefore I sought</L>
<L>This office; for in yonder camp, O! King,</L>
<L>Some counsellors there are who urg'd the Caliph</L>
<L>To take advantage of this fair occasion</L>
<L>And hold the treaty void.</L>
</SP>

<L>That I believe,</L>

<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ha! by Heaven, he's but a youth,</L>

<L>He moves my pity much. Unhappy youth!</L>
<STAGE>[To the prisoner.]</STAGE>
<L>Art thou the chief of that unruly band,</L>
<L>Who broke the treaty and assail'd the Moors?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUTH.</SPEAKER>
<L>No chief, no leader of a band am I.</L>
<L>The leader of a band insulted me,</L>
<L>And those he led basely assail'd my life</L>
<L>With bad success indeed. If self-defence</L>
<L>Be criminal, O King! I have offended.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING. [<HI>To Hamet.</HI>]</SPEAKER>
<L>With what a noble confidence he speaks!</L>

<SPEAKER>HAMET.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am fix'd upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Didst thou alone engage a band of Moors</L>
<L>And make such havoc? Sure it cannot be.</L>
<L>Recall thy-scattered thoughts. Nothing advance</L>
<L>Which proof may overthrow.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>YOUTH.</SPEAKER>
<L>What I have said</L>
<L>No proof can overthrow. Where is the man,</L>
<L>Who speaking from himself, not from reports</L>
<L>And rumors idle, will stand forth and say</L>
<L>I was not single when the Moors attack'd me?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAMET.</SPEAKER>
<L>I will not be that man, tho' I confess,</L>
<L>That I came hither to accuse thee, Youth!</L>

<P>The tale was false.</P>

<L>For none but cowards lie.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thy story tell,</L>
<L>With every circumstance which may explain</L>
<L>The seeming wonder; how a single man</L>
<L>In such a strife could stand?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUTH.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twill cease to be</L>
<L>A wonder, when thou hear'st the story told.</L>
<L>This morning on my road to Oviedo</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="25"/>A while I halted near a Moorish post.</L>
<L>Of the commander I enquir'd my way,</L>
<L>And told my purpose, that I came to see</L>
<L>The famous combat. With a scornful smile,</L>
<L>With taunting words and gestures he replied,</L>
<L>Mocking my youth. Advis'd me to return</L>
<L>Back to my father's house, and in the ring</L>
<L>To dance with boys and girls. He added too</L>
<L>That I should see no combat. That no knight</L>
<L>Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moors.</L>
<L>Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn.</L>
<L>The quarrel grew apace, and I defied him,</L>
<L>To a green hill, which rose amidst the plain,</L>
<L>An arrow's flight or farther from his post.</L>
<L>Alone we sped: at once we drew, we fought.</L>
<L>The Moorish captain fell. Enrag'd his men</L>
<L>Flew to revenge his death. Secure they came</L>
<L>Each with his utmost speed. Those who came first</L>
<L>Single I met and slew. More wary grown</L>
<L>The rest together join'd, and all at once</L>
<L>Assail'd me. Then I had no hopes of life.</L>
<L>But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came</L>
<L>And charg'd my foes, who did not long sustain</L>
<L>The shock, but fled, and carried to their camp</L>
<L>That false report which thou, O King! hast heard.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now by my sceptre, and my sword, I swear,</L>
<L>Thou art a noble youth. An angel's voice</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="26"/>Could not command a more implicit faith</L>
<L>Than thou from me hast gain'd. What think'st thou, Hamet?</L>
<L>Is he not greatly wrong'd?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HAMET.</SPEAKER>
<L>By Allah! yes.</L>
<L>The voice of truth and innocence is bold,</L>
<L>And never yet could guilt that tone assume.</L>
<L>I take my leave impatient to return,</L>
<L>And satisfy my friends that this brave youth</L>
<L>Was not th' aggressor.</L>

<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Tell me, wondrous Youth!</L>
<L>For much I long to know; what is thy name?</L>
<L>Who are thy parents? Since the Moor prevail'd.</L>
<L>Thecottage and the cave have oft' conceal'd</L>
<L>From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain:</L>
<L>Thy spirit speaks for thee. Thou art a shoot</L>
<L>Of some illustrious stock, some noble house</L>
<L>Whose fortunes with their falling country fell.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUTH.</SPEAKER>
<L>Alberto is my name. I draw my birth</L>
<L>From Catalonia; in the mountains there</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="27"/>My father dwells, and for his own domains</L>
<L>Pays tribute to the Moor. He was a soldier:</L>
<L>Oft' I have heard him of your battles speak,</L>
<L>Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field.</L>
<L>But ever since I can remember ought,</L>
<L>His chief employment and delight have been</L>
<L>To train me to the use and love of arms;</L>
<L>In martial exercise we past the day;</L>
<L>Morning and evening, still the theme was war.</L>
<L>He bred me to endure the summer's heat,</L>
<L>And brave the winter's cold: To swim across</L>
<L>The headlong torrent, when the shoals of ice</L>
<L>Drove down the stream. To rule the fiercest steed</L>
<L>That on our mountains run. No savage beast</L>
<L>The forest yields that I have not encounter'd.</L>
<L>Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game;</L>
<L>I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain,</L>
<L>Oft I implor'd my father to permit me,</L>
<L>Before the truce was made, to join the host.</L>
<L>He said it must not be, I was too young</L>
<L>For the rude fervice of these trying times.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he permit you now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>A strange adventure</L>
<L>Forc'd me from home. Not many days ago,</L>
<L>When hunting in the woods, I heard a voice,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="28"/>A woman's voice, calling aloud for help.</L>
<L>I rush'd into the thicket; there I saw</L>
<L>A moorish Lord, for brutal licence fam'd,</L>
<L>Who shamefully abus'd a rural maid</L>
<L>Of Spanish race. I free'd her from his arms.</L>
<L>The moor spake not a word, but mad with rage</L>
<L>Snatch'd up his lance, which stood against a tree,</L>
<L>And at me flew. I turn'd his point aside,</L>
<L>And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart.</L>
<L>I hasten'd home, but did not find my father;</L>
<L>Nor was it sase to wait for his return.</L>
<L>I took the fairest armour in the hall,</L>
<L>And hither bent my course. The rest thou know'st.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou art a prodigy, and fill'ft my mind</L>
<L>With thoughts profound and expectation high.</L>
<L>When in a nation, humbled by the will</L>
<L>Of Providence, beneath an haughty foe,</L>
<L>A person rises up, by nature rear'd,</L>
<L>Sublime, above the level of mankind;</L>
<L>Like that bright bow, the hand of the most High</L>
<L>Bends in the wat'ry cloud: He is the sign</L>
<L>Of prosp'rous change and interposing Heav'n:</L>
<L>And thou, if right I read—</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<L>The champion, Sir,</L>
<L>Who comes to fight for Spain, is near at hand:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="29"/>One of our scouts has seen him and his trian,</L>
<L>But brings a strange report, which damps the heart</L>
<L>Of every Spaniard. It is not Alonzo.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>What say'st thou? God of heaven! Not Alonzo!</L>
<L>Who is he then?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MESSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<L>That is not fully known.</L>
<L>Clad in the flowing vesture of the east,</L>
<L>A Persian turban on his head he wears,</L>
<L>Yet he's a christian knight. To mark his falth,</L>
<L>Holy, and adverse to Mohammed's law,</L>
<L>Before his steps a silken banner borne</L>
<L>Streams in the wind, and shews a golden cross,</L>
</SP>

<L>And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes</L>
<L>Are vanish'd like a dream.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>I grieve to see</L>
<L>The king afflicted.</L>
</SP>

<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah! Thou dost not know</L>
<L>How deep these tidings strike.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is not the king</L>
<L>Free to accept or to refuse the aid</L>
<L>This stranger offers?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Be not offended, Sir, at my presumption,</L>
<L>For from my heart I speak, a loyal heart,</L>
<L>True to my sov'reign and my native land.</L>
<L>If this is not Alonzo, why should he,</L>
<L>Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain?</L>
<L>Are there not warriors born of Spanish race,</L>
<L>Who court the combat?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>To my words attend.</L>
<L>The Moorish champion is of great renown;</L>
<L>In stature like the giant race of old,</L>
<L>Like Anak's true, or Titan's fabled sons.</L>
<L>Against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts,</L>
<L>But in his might secure, a mace he wields,</L>
<L>Whose sway resistless breaks both shield and arm,</L>
<L>And crushes head and helmet. Thus he fights</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="31"/>Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale</L>
<L>Of three successive battles. He is deem'd</L>
<L>Invincible but by Alonzo's arm:</L>
<L>Therefore our warriors, tho' they know no fear,</L>
<L>No fear of ought that can themselves befal,</L>
<L>Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,</L>
<L>And on his valour rest.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oft' have I heard</L>
<L>My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds;</L>
<L>What can with-hold him when his country calls?</L>
<L>Perhaps the last of combats he has fought,</L>
<L>And in the silent tomb the hero rests.</L>
<L>But, since he's absent, from whatever cause,</L>
<L>O! let no stranger knight his place assume,</L>
<L>To bring dishonour on the Spanish name.</L>
<L>If this gigantic champion of the Moors,</L>
<L>Clad in the glory of his battles won,</L>
<L>Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour,</L>
<L>Let me, tho' young in arms, the combat claim,</L>
<L>On me his fame has no impression made.</L>
<L>I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart.</L>
<L>It beats for battle now. Oft have I kill'd</L>
<L>The wolf, the boar, and the wild mountain bull,</L>
<L>For sport and pastime. Shall this Moorish dog</L>
<L>Resist me fighting in my country's cause?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>By heaven and earth, thou mov'st me much! thy words</L>
<L>Have stirr'd the embers of my youthful fire.</L>
<L>Thou mak'st me wish I could recal those days,</L>
<L>When of an age like thine, and not unlike</L>
<L>To thee in face and form, I rais'd the spear</L>
<L>Against the Moor, in Cava's bloody field.</L>
<L>Then by my hand the great Alchammon fell,</L>
<L>The strength and pillar of the Caliph's host.</L>
<L>Then I was sit to meet Mirmallon's arm.</L>
<L>But now, my hairs are grey, my steps are slow,</L>
<L>My sword descending breaks the shield no more:</L>
<L>Our foes have known it long.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALBERTO.</SPEAKER>
<L>O! King, thou art</L>
<L>Thy country's great deliv'rer, and the sole</L>
<L>Restorer of the state. Pelagio's fame</L>
<L>Shall never die: But let thy counsel now</L>
<L>(As oft thy valour) save this land from shame.</L>
<L>Let not a foreign warrior take the field,</L>
<L>And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<L>My voice alone cannot determine that.</L>
<L>The council sit assembled near the lists,</L>
<L>To them I will present thee. If this knight</L>
<L>Unknown, who from that distant egion comes,</L>
<L>Where the bright sun lights up his golden lamp,</L>
<L>Bears not some high pre-eminence about him,</L>

<L>Not to be told in parcels and by starts,</L>

<L>Not to resist her father, nor advance</L>
<L>My better title to the crown of Spain,</L>
<L>As I had once resolv'd. My rage she sooth'd,</L>
<L>Pride, anger, int'rest, yielded all to love.</L>
<L>With her I made a merit of obedience,</L>
<L>And pleaded so effectually my cause,</L>
<L>That she consented to a private marriage,</L>
<L>Before I left the kingdon. We were married,</L>
<L>And met together, four successive nights,</L>
<L>In the sequestered cottage of the wood,</L>
<L>Behind the palace garden. O! I thought</L>
<L>Myself the happiest and the most belov'd</L>
<L>Of all mankind. She mock'd me all the while;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="48"/>Meant me the cover of her loose amours.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>VELASCO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your eyes beheld!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABDALLAH.</SPEAKER>
<L>By Heav'n and Hell—they did.</L>
<L>The night preceding the appointed day</L>
<L>Of my departure, from the realm of Spain,</L>
<L>I slew impatient to the place of meeting,</L>
<L>Before the hour was come: To wear away</L>
<L>The tedious time, for ev'ry minute seem'd</L>
<L>An age to me, I struck into the wood</L>
<L>And wander'd there, still steering to the gate</L>
<L>By which she was to enter. Tho' the trees</L>
<L>The moon full orb'd in all her glory shone.</L>
<L>My am'rous mind a sportful purpose form'd,</L>
<L>Unseen to watch the coming of my bride,</L>
<L>And wantonly surprize her. Near the gate</L>
<L>There stood an aged tree. It was a beech,</L>
<L>Which far and wide stretch'd forth its level arms</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="49"/>Low, near the ground, and form'd a gloomy shade.</L>
<L>Behind its trunk I took my secret stand;</L>
<L>The gate was full in view, and the green path</L>
<L>On which it open'd. There I stood awhile,</L>
<L>And soon I heard the turning of the key.</L>
<L>My heart beat thick with joy—and forth she came:—</L>
<L>Not as I wish'd: She had a minion with her;</L>
<L>A handsome youth was tripping by her side,</L>
<L>Girt with a sword, and dress'd in gay attire.</L>
<L>He seem'd to court her, as they pass'd along,</L>
<L>Coy, but not angry, for I heard her laugh.</L>
<L>She flung away. He follow'd, soon o'erttok her,</L>
<L>Embrac'd her—</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VELASCO.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! The Princess Ormisinda!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ABDALLAH.</SPEAKER>
<L>I drew my sword, that I remember well,</L>
<L>And then an interval like death ensued.</L>
<L>When consciousness return'd, I found myself</L>
<L>Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground</L>
<L>Under the tree: My sword lay by my side.</L>
<L>The sudden shock, the transport of my rage,</L>
<L>And grief, had stopt the current of my blood,</L>
<L>And made a pause of life.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>VELASCO.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>ABDALLAH.</SPEAKER>
<L>With life and sense,</L>

<L>But whether they had heard my heavy fall,</L>
<L>Or that my death-like swoon had lasted long,</L>
<L>I know not, but I never saw them more.</L>
<L>I search'd till morning; then away I went,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to scorn the strumpet, and forget her.</L>
<L>But I have not been able to forget</L>
<L>Nor to despise her; tho' I hate her more</L>
<L>Than e'er I lov'd her, still her image haunts me</L>
<L>Where'er I go. I think of nothing else</L>
<L>When I'm awake, and never shut my eyes</L>
<L>But she's the certain vision of my dream.</L>
<L>Sometimes, in all her loveliness she comes</L>
<L>Without her crimes: In extasy I wake,</L>
<L>And wish the vision had endur'd for ever.</L>

<L>Which since I have so happily discharg'd,</L>
<L>The Princess sent and call'd me to her presence.</L>
<L><PB N="45" REF="52"/>The treaty with the Moor engross'd her thoughts.</L>
<L>That sad and pensive air she always wears</L>
<L>Was settled to a thicker gloom of grief.</L>
<L>Her voice was low and languid. Few her words,</L>
<L>And the short periods ended with a sigh.</L>
<L>But when I gave her hopes of thy return,</L>
<L>A sudden gleam of joy spread o'er her face,</L>
<L>Like morning breaking in a cloudy sky.</L>
<L>With earnest voice, still rising as she spoke,</L>
<L>She urg'd dispatch, exhorted me to zeal</L>
<L>And perseverance, Never to desist</L>
<L>Till I had found thee: For her fate, she said,</L>
<L>The fate of Spain, depended on Alonzo.</L>

<L>He did not deign to look upon the present,</L>

<L>Like a blind man, and would have stood so still,</L>
<L>Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls.</L>
<L>And all the while he star'd me in the face,</L>

<L>The modest mind. Would'st thou believe, Sebastian,</L>
<L>She talk'd to me, I cannot tell how long,</L>
<L>Before thou cam'st, and question'd me minutely</L>
<L>How I had liv'd, how past my youthful days?</L>
<L>I fear I was too copious in my answers.</L>
<L>What signifies my rural life to her?</L>
<L>And yet she seem'd to listen with delight,</L>

<L>Safe and without a wound,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEBASTIAN.</SPEAKER>
<L>The hills, of various slope</L>
<L>And shape, which circle round the spacious plain,</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="63"/>Were cover'd with a multitude immense</L>
<L>Of either sex, of every age and rank,</L>
<L>Christian and Moor; whose faces and attire</L>
<L>Strangely diversified the living scene.</L>
<L>Within the lists a gallery was rais'd</L>
<L>In which thy father and the Moorish prince</L>
<L>Sate with their peers, the judges of the field.</L>
<L>To them the knights with slow and stately pace</L>
<L>Approach'd; and bound by sacred oaths declar'd</L>
<L>That they no charm nor incantation us'd,</L>
<L>But trusted in their valour and their arms.</L>
<L>With low obeisance then they both fell back;</L>
<L>And first the Moor (for he the challenge gave)</L>
<L>March'd to the middle of the listed field;</L>
<L>There seiz'd his ponderous mace, beneath whose weight,</L>
<L>The brawny bearer bow'd; and round his head,</L>
<L>Like a light foil, he flourish'd it in air.</L>
<L>On him with diff'rent thoughts the nations gaz'd.</L>
<L>But suddenly a flash of light and flame</L>
<L>Struck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's shield,</L>
<L>Cover'd till then. 'Twas made of polish'd steel,</L>
<L>Which shone like adamant; and to a point</L>
<L>Rose in the centre, stanting on each side.</L>
<L>This shield the Persian Prince advancing bore</L>
<L>On his left arm outstretch'd, and in his right,</L>
<L>Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed sword.</L>
<L>Erect and high the bold Mirmallon stood,</L>
<L>And sternly ey'd his near-approaching oe.</L>
<L>Then forward sprung, and on the flaming shield</L>
<L>Discharg'd a mighty blow, enough to crush</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="64"/>A wall, or split a rock. The Spaniards gave</L>
<L>A general groan.</L>

<L>Glancing from the shield,</L>

<L>Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapon rear'd.</L>
<L>In stept the Prince, and raising high his shield,</L>
<L>Midway he met the blow; and with the strength</L>
<L>And vigour of his arm, obliquely down</L>
<L>The pond'rous mace he drove. Then quick as thought,</L>
<L>His better hand and foot at once advancing,</L>
<L>Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade.</L>
<L>The giant stagger'd for a little space;</L>
<L>Then falling, shook the earth. The Christians rais'd</L>
<L>A shout that rent the air. Away I came,</L>

<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. BARRY.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>THO' lately dead, a Princess, and of Spain,</L>
<L>I am no Ghost, but Flesh and Blood again!</L>
<L>No time to change this Dress, it is expedient,</L>
<L>I pass for British, and your most obedient.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How happy, Ladies, for us all—That we,</L>
<L>Born in this Isle, by Magna Charta free,</L>
<L>Are not like Spanish Wives, kept under Lock and Key.</L>
<L>The <HI>Spaniard now,</HI> is not like him of Yore,</L>
<L>Who in his whisker'd face, his Titles bore!</L>
<L>Nor Joy, nor Vengeance made him smile or grin,</L>
<L>Fix'd were his features, tho' the Devil within!</L>
<L>He, when once jealous, to wash out the Stain,</L>
<L>Stalk'd home, stabb'd Madam, and stalk'd out again.</L>
<L>Thanks to the times, this Dagger-drawing passion,</L>
<L>Thro' polish'd Europe, is quite out of Fashion.</L>
<L><HI>Signor Th' Italian,</HI> quick of sight and hearing,</L>
<L>Once ever lisf'ning, and for ever leering,</L>
<L>To <HI>Cara Sposa,</HI> now politely kind,</L>
<L>He, best of Husbands, is both deaf and blind.</L>
<L><HI>Mynheer the Dutchman,</HI> with his sober pace,</L>
<L>Whene'er be finds his Rib has wanted Grace,</L>
<L>He feels no Branches sprouting from his Brain,</L>
<L>But Calculation makes of Loss and Gain,</L>
<L>And when to part with her, occasion's ripe,</L>
<L>Mynheer turns out mine Frow, an smokes his pipe.</L>
<L>When a brisk <HI>Frenchman's</HI> Wife is giv'n to prancing,</L>
<L>It never spoils his Singing or his Dancing:</L>
<L><PB REF="95"/>
Madams, you false—de tout mon Coeur—Adieu;</L>
<L>Begar you Cocu me, I Cocu you.—</L>
<L>He, torjours gai, dispels each jealous Vapour,</L>
<L>Takes Snusf, sings Vive l'amour, and cuts a Caper.</L>
<L>As for <HI>John Bull</HI>—not he in upper Life,</L>
<L>But the plain Englishman, who loves his Wife;</L>
<L>When honest John, I say, has got his doubts,</L>
<L>He sullen grows, scratches his head, and pouts.</L>
<L><HI>What is the Matter with you, Love?</HI> Cries She;</L>
<L><HI>Are you not well, my Dearest?</HI> Humph! Cries He:</L>
<L><HI>You're such a Brute!—But, Mr. Bull, I've done:</HI></L>
<L>And if I am a Brute—Who made me one?</L>
<L><HI>You know my tenderness—My heart's too full,</HI></L>
<L>And so's my head—I thank you Mrs. Bull.</L>
<L><HI>O you base Man!</HI>—Zounds, Madam, there's no bearing,</L>
<L>She falls a weeping, and he falls a swearing:</L>
<L>With Tears and Oaths, the Storm domestick ends.</L>
<L>The Thunder dies away, the rain descends,</L>
<L>She sabs, he melts, and then they kiss and Friends.</L>
<L>Whatever case these modern Modes may bring,</L>
<L>A little Jealousy is no bad thing:</L>
<L>To me, who speak from Nature unrefin'd,</L>
<L>Jealousy is the Bellows of the Mind.</L>
<L>Touch it but gently, and it warms desire,</L>
<L>If handled roughly, you are all on Fire!</L>
<L>If it stands still, Affection must expire!</L>
<L>This Truth, no true Philosopher can doubt.</L>
<L>Whate'er you do—let not the Flame go out.</L>
