<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry, to raise, if possible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Composition, and the charac∣ter of modern Times will allow: The ages, in∣deed, are past, in which the song of the Poet was idolized for its <HI>miraculous effects</HI>; yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may still, perhaps, be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to socie∣ty in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober Reason, it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions, in which a poetical Enthusiast may be safely indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>The following production owes its existence to an incident in real life, very similar to the principal action of the last Canto; but in form∣ing the general plan of the work, it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwithstand∣ing the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope. I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture; and, to avoid the servility of imitation, I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass: Happy, indeed, if the judgment of the Public may enable me to ex∣claim, with the honest vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine pro∣ductions of Raphael,
<Q>E son Pittore anch' Io!</Q></P>
<P>The celebrated Alessandro Tassoni, who is generally considered as the inventor of the mo∣dern
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
Heroi-comic Poety, was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition, that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS. copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inscription, in which he styled it a new species of Poetry, in∣vented by himself.</P>
<P>A few partial friends have asserted, that the present performance has some degree of similar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it pos∣sesses, may rather require an apology, than en∣title its Author to challenge commendation, I shall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing, and slightly mention the poe∣tical effects, which such a variation appeared likely to produce.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the favourite Poems, which blend the serious and the comic, repre∣sent
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
their principal characters in a satirical point of view: It was the intention of Tassoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to satirize a particular Italian Nobleman, who happened to be the object of his resent∣ment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Ec∣clesiastics in his Lutrin; Garth, our English Physicians, in his Dispensary; and the Rape of the Lock itself, that most excellent and enchant∣ing Poem, which I never contemplate but with new idolatry, is denominated <HI>the best Satire extant,</HI> by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very elegant and ingenious, but severe Essay on Pope: A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself, in his letter to Mrs. Fer∣mor, where he says, <Q>The character of Belinda, as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but in beauty.</Q> Though I think, that no composition can surpass, or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius, as a sportive
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
Satire, I imagined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the most de∣licate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not also aspire to deline∣ate the more engaging features of Female Excel∣lence. The idea appeared to me worth the ex∣periment; for, if it succeeded, it seemed to promise a double advantage; first, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, secondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more interesting to the heart. On these principles, I have endeavoured to paint SERENA as a most lovely, engaging, and ac∣complished character; yet I hope the colour∣ing is so faithfully copied from <HI>general Nature,</HI> that every man, who reads the Poem, may be
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
happy enough to know many Fair ones, who resemble my Heroine.</P>
<P>There is another point, in which I have al∣so attempted to give this Poem an air of no∣velty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes, which compose it; by shifting these in alternate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a strong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an ap∣pearance particularly diversified. I wished, in∣deed (but I fear most ineffectually) for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto, and the more serious sublime painting of Dante, with some portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagination, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if possible, with∣out violating those rules of propriety, which Mr. Cambridge has illustrated, by example as well as precept, in The Scribleriad, and in
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
his sensible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem.</P>
<P>I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the <HI>extent,</HI> or rather of the <HI>extravagance</HI> of my desire; for I will not give it the serious name of <HI>design</HI>: They, whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea, will not only be the first to discern, but the most ready to pardon those errors, into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public, by a Dissertation of considerable length on this species of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such prelimi∣nary remarks, as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce, from the reflection, that, how∣ever ingeniously written, they add little or no∣thing to the success of a good Poem, and are
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</P>
<P>In dismissing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their perusal, I shall only recommend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni—
<Q><L>Vaglia il buon voler, s' altro non lice,</L>
<L>E chi la leggera, viva felice!</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>THE TRIUMPHS OF TEMPER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="canto">
<HEAD>CANTO I.</HEAD>
<L>THE Mind's soft Guardian, who, tho' yet unsung,</L>
<L>Inspires with harmony the female tongue,</L>
<L>And gives, improving every tender grace,</L>
<L>The smile of angels to a mortal face;</L>
<L N="5">Her powers I sing; and scenes of mental strife,</L>
<L>Which form the maiden for th' accomplish'd wife;</L>
<L>Where the sweet victress sees, with sparkling eyes,</L>
<L>Love her reward, and Happiness her prize.</L>
<L>Daughters of Beauty, who the song inspire,</L>
<L N="10">To your enchanting notes attune my lyre!</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="13"/>And O! if haply your soft hearts may gain</L>
<L>Or use, or pleasure from the motley strain,</L>
<L>Tho' formal critics, with a surly frown,</L>
<L>Deny your artless Bard the laurel crown,</L>
<L N="15">He still shall triumph, if ye deign to spread</L>
<L>Your sweeter myrtle round his honour'd head.</L>
<L>In your bright circle young SERENA grew;</L>
<L>A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew;</L>
<L>For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien,</L>
<L N="20">And Heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen.</L>
<L>She seem'd a rose-bud, when it first receives</L>
<L>The genial sun in its expanding leaves:</L>
<L>For now she enter'd those important years,</L>
<L>When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears;</L>
<L N="25">When conscious Nature prompts the secret sigh,</L>
<L>And sheds sweet languor o'er the melting eye;</L>
<L>When nobler toys the female heart trepan,</L>
<L>And Dolls rejected, yield their place to Man.</L>
<L>Beneath a Father's care SERENA grew;</L>
<L N="30">The good Sir Gilbert, to his country true,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="14"/>A faithful Whig, who, zealous for the state,</L>
<L>In Freedom's service led the loud debate;</L>
<L>Yet every day, by transmutation rare,</L>
<L>Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow chair,</L>
<L N="35">And made his daughter pay, howe'er absurd,</L>
<L>Passive obedience to his sovereign word.</L>
<L>In his domestic sway he borrow'd aid</L>
<L>From prim PENELOPE, an ancient maid,</L>
<L>His upright sister, conscious of her worth,</L>
<L N="40">Who valued still her beauty, and her birth;</L>
<L>Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd,</L>
<L>And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd;</L>
<L>A restless ghost! that with remembrance keen</L>
<L>Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been;</L>
<L N="45">Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt,</L>
<L>To watch the tender nymph, and warm gallant;</L>
<L>And, with an eye that petrified pursuit,</L>
<L>Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit.</L>
<L>Tho' strictly guarded by this jealous power,</L>
<L N="50">The mild SERENA no restraint could sour:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="15"/>Pure was her bosom, as the silver lake,</L>
<L>Ere rising winds the ruffled water shake,</L>
<L>When the bright pageants of the morning sky</L>
<L>Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly,</L>
<L N="55">By vernal gales in gay succession driven,</L>
<L>While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven.</L>
<L>In gay content a sportive life she led,</L>
<L>The child of Modesty, by Virtue bred:</L>
<L>Her light companions Innocence and Ease:</L>
<L N="60">Her hope was Pleasure, and her wish to please:</L>
<L>For this to Fashion early rites she paid:</L>
<L>For this to Venus secret vows she made;</L>
<L>Nor held it sin to cast a private glance</L>
<L>O'er the dear pages of a new romance,</L>
<L N="65">Eager in Fiction's touching scenes to find</L>
<L>A field, to exercise her youthful mind:</L>
<L>The touching scenes new energy imprest</L>
<L>On all the virtues of her feeling breast.</L>
<L>Sweet Evelina's fascinating power</L>
<L N="70">Had first beguil'd of sleep her midnight hour:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="16"/>Possest by Sympathy's enchanting sway,</L>
<L>She read, unconscious of the dawning day.</L>
<L>The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd</L>
<L>Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid.</L>
<L N="75">The nymph, attentive as the brooding dove,</L>
<L>Pored o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love:</L>
<L>The sinking taper now grew weak and pale;</L>
<L>SERENA sigh'd, and dropt th' unfinish'd tale;</L>
<L>But, as warm clouds in vernal aether roll,</L>
<L N="80">The soft ideas floated in her soul:</L>
<L>Free from ambitious pride, and envious care,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd, was all her prayer:</L>
<L>While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd,</L>
<L>Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast.</L>
<L N="85">Scarce had her radiant eyes began to close,</L>
<L>When to her view a friendly vision rose:</L>
<L>A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight,</L>
<L>Light as the gossamer, as aether bright;</L>
<L>Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form,</L>
<L N="90">When the sage Goddess stills the martial storm.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="17"/>Her casque was amber, richly grac'd above</L>
<L>With down, collected from the callow dove:</L>
<L>Her burnish'd breast-plate, of a deeper dye,</L>
<L>Was once the armour of a golden fly:</L>
<L N="95">A lynx's eye her little aegis shone,</L>
<L>By fairy spells converted into stone,</L>
<L>And worn of old, as elfin poets sing,</L>
<L>By Aegypt's lovely queen, a favourite ring:</L>
<L>Mysterious power was in the magic toy,</L>
<L N="100">To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy.</L>
<L>Her tiny lance, whose radiance stream'd afar,</L>
<L>Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star.</L>
<L>A filmy mantle round her figure play'd,</L>
<L>Fine as the texture, by Arachne laid</L>
<L N="105">O'er some young plant, when glittering to the view</L>
<L>With many an orient pearl of morning dew.</L>
<L>The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair</L>
<L>With such a lively smile of tender care,</L>
<L>As on her elfin lord Titania cast,</L>
<L N="110">When first she found his angry spell was past.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="18"/>Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie</L>
<L>An ample ribband of caerulean dye:</L>
<L>High o'er her forehead rose the graceful bow,</L>
<L>Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below:</L>
<L N="115">The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot,</L>
<L>And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot;</L>
<L>As the fair flutterer, of Psyche's race,</L>
<L>Is seen to terminate her airy chace,</L>
<L>When, pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close,</L>
<L N="120">Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose.</L>
<L>Now in soft notes, more musically clear</L>
<L>Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal ear,</L>
<L>These words the visionary voice convey'd</L>
<L>To the charm'd spirit of the sleeping maid:</L>
<L N="125">"Thou darling of my care! whose ripen'd worth</L>
<L>Shall spread my empire o'er the smiling earth;</L>
<L>Whom Nature blest, forbidding modish Art</L>
<L>To cramp thy spirit, or contract thy heart;</L>
<L>Screen'd from thy thought, nor in thy visions felt,</L>
<L N="130">Long on thy opening mind I've fondly dwelt;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="19"/>In childhood's sorrows brought thee quick relief,</L>
<L>And dry'd thy April showers of infant grief;</L>
<L>Taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy,</L>
<L>Who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy,</L>
<L N="135">To bear what ills the little Female haunt,</L>
<L>The testy Nurse, the imperious Governante,</L>
<L>And that tyrannic pest, the prying maiden Aunt.</L>
<L>Now ripening years a nobler scene supply;</L>
<L>For life now opens on thy sparkling eye:</L>
<L N="140">Thy rising bosom swells with just desire</L>
<L>Rapture to feel, and rapture to inspire:</L>
<L>Not the vain bliss, the transitory joys,</L>
<L>That childish Woman feels in radiant toys;</L>
<L>The costly Diamond, or the lighter Pearl,</L>
<L N="145">The massive Nabob, or the tinsel Earl.</L>
<L>Thy heart demands, each meaner aim above,</L>
<L>Th' imperishable wealth of sterling love;</L>
<L>Thy wish, to please by ev'ry softer grace</L>
<L>Of elegance and ease, of form and face!</L>
<L N="150"><PB N="9" REF="20"/>By lively fancy and by sense refin'd,</L>
<L>The stronger magic of the cultur'd mind!</L>
<L>Thy pure ambition, and thy virtuous plan,</L>
<L>To fix the variable heart of Man!</L>
<L>Short is the worship paid at Beauty's shrine;</L>
<L N="155">But lasting Love and Happiness are mine:</L>
<L>Mine, tho' the earth's mistaken, blinded race</L>
<L>Despise my influence, and my name debase;</L>
<L>Nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend,</L>
<L>On whom the colours of their life depend.</L>
<L N="160">But to thy innocence I'll now display</L>
<L>The mystic marvels of my secret sway;</L>
<L>And tell, in this thy fate-deciding hour,</L>
<L>My race, my name, my office, and my power.</L>
<L>First, hear what wonders human forms contain!</L>
<L N="165">And learn the texture of the Female brain!</L>
<L>By Nature's care in curious order spread,</L>
<L>This living net is fram'd of tender thread;</L>
<L>Fine, as thy hand, some favour'd youth to grace,</L>
<L>Knits with nice art to form the mimic lace.</L>
<L N="170"><PB N="10" REF="21"/>Within the center of this fretted dome,</L>
<L>Her secret tower, her heaven-constructed home,</L>
<L>Soft Sensibility, sweet Beauty's soul!</L>
<L>Keeps her coy state, and animates the whole,</L>
<L>Invisible as Harmony, who springs,</L>
<L N="175">Wak'd by young Zephyr, from Aeolian strings:</L>
<L>Her subtle power, more delicately fine,</L>
<L>Dwells in each thread, and lives in every line,</L>
<L>Whose quick vibrations, without end, impart</L>
<L>Pleasure and pain to the responsive heart.</L>
<L N="180">As Zephyr's breath the willing chord inspires,</L>
<L>Whispering soft music to the trembling wires,</L>
<L>So with fond care I regulate, unseen,</L>
<L>The softer movements of this nice machine;</L>
<L>TEMPER my earthly name, the nurse of Love!</L>
<L N="185">But call'd SOPHROSYNE in realms above!</L>
<L>When lovely Woman, perfect at her birth,</L>
<L>Blest with her early charms the wond'ring earth,</L>
<L>Her soul, in sweet simplicity array'd,</L>
<L>Nor shar'd my guidance, nor requir'd my aid.</L>
<L N="190"><PB N="11" REF="22"/>Her tender frame, nor confident nor coy,</L>
<L>Had every fibre tun'd to gentle joy:</L>
<L>No vain caprices swell'd her pouting lip;</L>
<L>No gold produc'd a mercenary trip;</L>
<L>Soft innocence inspir'd her willing kiss,</L>
<L N="195">Her love was nature, and her life was bliss.</L>
<L>Guide of his reason, not his passion's prey,</L>
<L>She tamed the savage, Man, who bless'd her sway.</L>
<L>No jarring wishes fill'd the world with woes,</L>
<L>But youth was ecstacy, and age repose.</L>
<L N="200">The Powers of Mischief met, in dark Divan,</L>
<L>To blast these mighty joys of envied Man:</L>
<L>The Fiends, at their infernal Leader's call,</L>
<L>Fram'd their base wiles in Demogorgon's hall.</L>
<L>In the deep center of that dreadful dome,</L>
<L N="205">An hellish cauldron boil'd with fiery foam:</L>
<L>In this wide urn the circling spirits threw</L>
<L>Ingredients harsh, and hideous to the view;</L>
<L>While the terrific master of the spell</L>
<L>With adjurations shook the depths of hell,</L>

<L>Bade the dire offspring of his art appear.</L>
<L>Forth from the vase, with sullen murmurs, broke</L>
<L>A towering mass of pestilential smoke:</L>
<L>Emerging from this fog of thickest night,</L>
<L N="215">A Phantom swells, by slow degrees, to sight;</L>
<L>But ere the view can seize the forming shape,</L>
<L>From the mock'd eye its lineaments escape:</L>
<L>It seem'd all passions melted into one,</L>
<L>Assum'd the face of all, and yet was none:</L>
<L N="220">Hell stood aghast at its portentous mien,</L>
<L>And shuddering Demons call'd the spectre Spleen.</L>
<L>Hie thee to earth! its mighty master cried,</L>
<L>O'er the vex'd globe in heavy vapours ride!</L>
<L>Within its center fix thy shadowy throne!</L>
<L N="225">With shades thy subjects, and that hell thy own!</L>
<L>Reign there unseen! but let thy strong controul</L>
<L>Be hourly felt in Woman's wayward soul!</L>
<L>With darkest poisons from our deep abyss,</L>
<L>Taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss!</L>
<L N="230"><PB N="13" REF="26"/>Th' enormous Phantom, at this potent sound,</L>
<L>Roll'd forth obedient from the vast profound:</L>
<L>The quaking Fiends recover'd from their dread,</L>
<L>And Hell grew lighter, as the monster fled.</L>
<L>But now round earth the gliding vapours run,</L>
<L N="235">Blot the rich aether, and eclipse the sun;</L>
<L>All Nature sickens; and her fairest flower,</L>
<L>Enchanting Woman, feels the baneful power:</L>
<L>As in her soul the clouds of Spleen arise,</L>
<L>The sprightly essence of her beauty flies:</L>
<L N="240">In youth's gay prime, in hours with rapture warm,</L>
<L>Love looks astonish'd on her altering form:</L>
<L>To pleasing frolics, and enchanting wiles,</L>
<L>Life-darting looks, and soul-subduing smiles,</L>
<L>Dark whims succeed: thick-cov'ring fancies fret;</L>
<L N="245">The sullen passion, and the hasty pet;</L>
<L>The swelling lip, the tear-distended eye,</L>
<L>The peevish question, the perverse reply;</L>
<L>The moody humour, that, like rain and fire,</L>
<L>Blends cold disgust with unsubdu'd desire,</L>
<L N="250"><PB N="14" REF="27"/>Flies what it loves, and, petulantly coy,</L>
<L>Feigns proud abhorrence of the proffer'd joy:</L>
<L>For Nature's artless aim, the wish to please</L>
<L>By genuine modesty, and simple ease,</L>
<L>Fashion's pert tricks the crowded brain oppress</L>
<L N="255">With all the poor parade of tawdry dress:</L>
<L>The sickly bosom pants for noise and shew,</L>
<L>For every bauble, and for every beau;</L>
<L>The voice, that Health made harmony, disowns</L>
<L>That native charm for Languor's mimic tones;</L>
<L N="260">And feigns disease, till, feeling what it feigns,</L>
<L>Its fancied maladies are real pains.</L>
<L>Such, and a thousand still superior woes,</L>
<L>From Spleen's new empire o'er the earth arose:</L>
<L>Each simple dictate of the soul forgot,</L>
<L N="265">Then first was form'd the mercenary plot;</L>
<L>And Beauty practis'd that pernicious art,</L>
<L>The art of angling for an old man's heart;</L>
<L>Tho' crawling to his bride with tottering knees,</L>

<L>But one loud jangle of incessant strife.</L>
<L>The gentle Sprite, who, on his radiant car,</L>
<L N="275">Shines the mild regent of the evening-star,</L>
<L>And joys from thence those genial rays to shed,</L>
<L>That lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed,</L>
<L>While earth's new ills his friendly soul absorb,</L>
<L>From Cynthia call'd me to his kindred orb;</L>
<L N="280">And, eager to redress the woes of Man,</L>
<L>The brilliant Son of Vesper thus began:</L>
<L>"Thou softest Being of the aetherial kind,</L>
<L>Be thy benignant cares no more confin'd</L>
<L>To smooth the ruffled plume of Zephyr's wing,</L>
<L N="285">To guard from cruel frost the infant spring,</L>
<L>To drive gross atoms from the rays of noon,</L>
<L>Or chase the halo from the vapourish moon!</L>
<L>Thy friendly nature will not now deny</L>
<L>To quit for nobler toils thy native sky;</L>
<L N="290"><PB N="16" REF="29"/>Thou seest how Spleen's infernal vapours roll</L>
<L>Across the sweet serene of Woman's soul;</L>
<L>And earth, which darkens as her beauties fade,</L>
<L>Must grow a second hell without thy aid:</L>
<L>Take then thy station! fix thy nobler reign</L>
<L N="295">O'er those fine chords, that form the Female brain,</L>
<L>That us'd, ere injur'd by the rust of Spleen,</L>
<L>To fill with harmony the human scene!</L>
<L>Go! lest her touch their tender tones destroy,</L>
<L>Teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy!</L>
<L N="300">Go! and restore, by stilling mental strife,</L>
<L>Health to faint Love, and happiness to Life!"</L>
<L>So spake that friend of Man, who lights above</L>
<L>His heavenly lamp of Hymenaeal love:</L>
<L>In his just aim my kindred spirit join'd,</L>
<L N="305">And flew obedient to the charge assign'd.</L>
<L>Hence, as the biass sways the unconscious bowl,</L>
<L>I long unseen have sway'd the careless soul;</L>
<L>Tho' oft I feel my power by Spleen subdu'd,</L>
<L>In the shrill Vixen, and the sullen Prude,</L>
<L N="310"><PB N="17" REF="30"/>In some fair forms my soft dominion grows,</L>

<L>Which heavenly Powers united to infold</L>
<L N="315">In perfect Woman's new-created mould;</L>
<L>When Nature, in her infant beauty blest,</L>

<L>TEMPER shall singly gain the splendid prize:</L>
<L N="350"><PB N="19" REF="32"/>The sudden conquest shall be mine alone,</L>

<L>Such are my hopes; but I with pain relate</L>
<L>What hard conditions are annex'd by Fate:</L>

<L N="355">Draw the rich perfume from the Persian rose,</L>

<L>Her inky Demons, who delight to print</L>
<L>Her base suggestion, and her envious hint:—</L>

<L>Whether these kindred Fiends, or one or all,</L>

<L>With this, my Caestus, thy soft bosom arm!</L>

<L>To hide the mystic band from mortal eyes!</L>
<L>When Spleen's dark Powers would teach that breast to swell,</L>
<L N="401">This guardian cincture shall those Powers repel:</L>

<L>The guardian cincture to her snowy breast,</L>
<L>More lovely far than Juno, when she strove</L>

<L>Her dazzling Caestus could alone inspire</L>
<L N="30">The sudden impulse of short-liv'd desire:</L>
<L>These finer threads with lasting charms are fraught,</L>

<L>Silence, that wins, where eloquence is vain,</L>

<L>But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace</L>
<L>His modern stature, and his modish face!</L>

<L>As the neat Daisy to the Sun's broad flower,</L>
<L N="130">As the French Boudoir to the Gothic Tower,</L>
<L>Such is the Peer, whom Fashion much admires,</L>
<L>Compar'd in person to his ancient sires:</L>

<L>Their coarse, loud language, and their coarser laugh,</L>
<L N="135">His finer form, more elegantly slim,</L>
<L>Displays the fashionable length of limb:</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="43"/>With foreign shrugs his country he regards,</L>

<L>As the nice workman in the wooden trade,</L>

<L>Thus our young Lord, with Fashion's phrase refin'd,</L>
<L>Fineer'd the mean interior of his mind:</L>

<L>The Vision's promise to her thought recurr'd.</L>

<L>"Of all my household, thou hast plagu'd me most:</L>

<L>"Thy midnight dream, thy morning thought, is Man.</L>
<L N="281">"Wert thou less closely to my blood allied,</L>

<L>"Be sent to sigh alone o'er purling brooks,</L>
<L>"Scold village maids, and croak to croaking rooks."</L>
<L N="285">He spoke indignant: the sly Fiend withdrew,</L>
<L>Nor inly griev'd; for well her force she knew.</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="51"/>As Indian females, in a jealous hour,</L>

<L>Thus the departing Fury left behind</L>
<L>Her venom, latent in Sir GILBERT's mind.</L>
<L>The hidden mischief tho' no eye observes,</L>
<L>He feels it fretting on his alter'd nerves;</L>
<L N="295">But the kind habit of his healthy soul</L>
<L>Still struggled hard against its base controul.</L>
<L>Now Spleen's dark vapours, in his bosom hid,</L>

<L>Now Love's soft pleadings that dire thought destroy,</L>

<L>At length the day, th' important day, arrives,</L>
<L N="305">Which in his breast must end the close debate,</L>
<L>And fix the colour of SERENA's sate.</L>
<L><PB N="39" REF="52"/>Now comes the hour, when the convivial Knight</L>
<L>Waits to begin the dinner's chearful rite:</L>
<L>His fond heart ever, with a Father's pride,</L>
<L N="310">Joys to behold his darling at his side;</L>
<L>But most the absence of her smile he feels</L>
<L>In the gay season of his social meals:</L>
<L>Hence, while for her the rich repast attends,</L>
<L>His hasty summons to the Nymph he sends:</L>
<L N="315">The happy Nymph superior cares induce</L>
<L>To risk his anger by a rash excuse:</L>

<L>She still is busy on her magic vest;</L>
<L>To range her diamonds in a sparkling zone,</L>
<L N="320">She begs to snatch her scanty meal alone.</L>
<L>The Knight in sullen state begins to dine:</L>
<L>Spleen, like a Harpy, flutters o'er his wine:</L>
<L>Invisible she poisons every dish,</L>
<L>Tinging with gall his mutton, fowl, and fish.</L>
<L N="325">The more he eats, the more perverse he grows;</L>
<L>For as his hunger sunk, his choler rose.</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="53"/>The cloth remov'd, he cries, with vapours sick,</L>
<L>The Pears are mellow, and the Port is thick;</L>
<L>Tho' nicer fruit Pomona never knew,</L>
<L N="330">And his rich wine surpass'd the ruby's hue!</L>
<L>A thousand times his dizzy brain revolves</L>
<L>A stern command: now doubts, and now resolves</L>
<L>To bid the Nymph descend, and, disarray'd,</L>
<L>Quit her dear project of the Masquerade:</L>
<L N="335">As oft kind Nature to his heart recurr'd,</L>
<L>And Love parental stopt the cruel word.</L>
<L>Mean time, unconscious of the brooding storm,</L>
<L>The Nymph exults in her improving form:</L>
<L>Gay is her smile, as those the Queen of Love</L>
<L N="340">Darts on the Graces in her court above,</L>
<L>While they contrive, with love-inspiring cares,</L>
<L>New modes of beauty for the robe she wears.</L>
<L>At length, each duty of the toilet past,</L>
<L>The glance of triumph on the mirror cast,</L>
<L N="345">Now the light wand our finish'd Ariel arms;</L>
<L>Glad Jenny glories in her Lady's charms;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="54"/>And gives full utterance, as she smooths her vest,</L>

<L N="350">Which trembling points to Pleasure's distant pole;</L>
<L>Which with fond trust on flattering Hope relies,</L>
<L>O'erleaps each peril, that in prospect lies,</L>
<L>And, springing to the goal, anticipates the prize!</L>
<L>Such was SERENA's fear-discarding state;</L>
<L N="355">Her eye beheld not the dark frowns of Fate:</L>
<L>She only saw, the combat all forgot,</L>
<L>The triumph promis'd as her glorious lot.</L>
<L>Now, eager to display her light attire,</L>
<L>The sprightly Damsel seeks her sullen Sire;</L>
<L N="360">His gloomy brow with sportive air she kist:</L>
<L>Ah! how could Spleen that magic lip resist?</L>
<L>That voice, whose melting music might assuage</L>
<L>The scorpion Anger's self-tormenting rage?</L>
<L>For ne'er did Nature to a Sire's embrace</L>

<L><PB N="42" REF="55"/>Or Fancy view a shape of lovelier kind</L>

<L>"I will not hear of Masquerades to-night:</L>

<L N="390">First her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline,</L>
<L>And deem the harsh command no fix'd design,</L>
<L>But the quick sally of a peevish word,</L>
<L>That Love revokes, the moment it is heard:</L>
<L>Or haply mirth, in mimic wrath exprest,</L>
<L N="395">A feign'd forbiddance utter'd but in jest:</L>
<L>To this short hope her sinking spirit clung,</L>
<L>To see his softening eyes refute his tongue.</L>
<L>Ah fruitless hope! for there she cannot find</L>
<L>The well-known signals of the friendly mind.</L>
<L N="400">Stern Contradiction, with the frown of Fate,</L>

<L>Hence the warm bosom of the lively Fair</L>
<L N="405">Now shivers with the chill of blank despair:</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="57"/>Now Disappointment's thick'ning shadows roll</L>
<L>A cloud of horror o'er the darken'd soul;</L>

<L>Much he inclines his mandate to recall,</L>

<L>But stubborn Pride forbids him to revoke</L>
<L>The solemn sentence, which Ill-humour spoke.</L>

<L>When, darting from her star-encircled throne,</L>
<L>Her Poet's eye commanded worlds unknown;</L>
<L N="5">When, by her fiat made a mimic God,</L>
<L>He saw Existence waiting on his nod,</L>
<L>And at his pleasure into being brought</L>
<L>New shadowy hosts, the vassals of his thought,</L>

<L N="10">Darker than night, and brighter than the day;</L>
<L>Who, at his bidding, thro' the wilds of air,</L>
<L>Rais'd willing mortals far from earthly care,</L>
<L>And led them wondering thro' his wide domain,</L>
<L>Beyond the bounds of Nature's narrow reign;</L>

<L>That Fairy shape no more she deigns to wear,</L>

<L>Jove's favourite daughter, arm'd in all his powers,</L>

<L N="55">When, on the golden car of Juno rais'd,</L>

<L><PB N="108" REF="121"/>With all her lustre, but without the dread</L>
<L>Which from her arm the frowning Gorgon shed,</L>
<L>SOPHROSYNE descends, with guardian Love,</L>
<L N="60">To waft her gentle Ward to worlds above.</L>
<L>From her fair brow a radiant diadem</L>
<L>Rose in twelve stars, and every separate gem</L>
<L>Shot magic rays, of virtue to controul</L>
<L>Some passion hostile to the human soul.</L>
<L N="65">Round her sweet form a robe of aether flow'd,</L>
<L>And in a wonderous car the smiling Spirit rode;</L>
<L>Firm as pure ivory, it charm'd the sight</L>
<L>With finer polish and a softer white.</L>
<L>The hand of Beauty, with an easy swell,</L>
<L N="70">Scoop'd the free concave like a bending shell;</L>
<L>And on its rich exterior, Art display'd</L>
<L>The triumphs of the Power the car convey'd.</L>
<L>Here, in celestial tints, surpassing life,</L>
<L>Sate lovely Gentleness, disarming Strife;</L>
<L N="75">There, young Affection, born of tender Thought,</L>
<L>In rosy chains the fiercer Passions caught;</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="122"/>Ambition, with his sceptre snapt in twain,</L>
<L>And Avarice, scorning what his chests contain.</L>
<L>Round the tame Vulture flies the fearless Dove;</L>
<L N="80">Soft Innocence embraces playful Love;</L>
<L>And laughing Sport, the frolic Child of Air,</L>

<L>These figures, pencil'd with a touch so light,</L>
<L>That every image seem'd an heavenly Sprite,</L>
<L N="85">Breathe on the car; whose sight-enchanting frame</L>
<L>Four wheels sustain, of pale and purple flame;</L>
<L>For no fleet animals, to earth unknown,</L>
<L>Bear thro' aetherial fields this flying throne.</L>
<L>As by the subtle electrician's skill,</L>
<L N="90">Globes seem to fly, obedient to his will;</L>
<L>So these four circles of instinctive fire</L>
<L>Move by the impulse of their Queen's desire,</L>
<L>Mount or descend by her directing care,</L>
<L>Or rest, supported by the buoyant air.</L>
<L N="95">Now, springing from her car, that hovering staid</L>
<L>High in the chamber of the sleeping Maid,</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="123"/>The Goddess, with a voice divinely clear,</L>
<L>Breath'd these kind accents in her Votary's ear:—</L>
<L>"Come, my fair Champion, who so well hast fought</L>
<L N="100">"The useful battles of contentious Thought;</L>

<L>"The dark devices of the Fiend elude;</L>
<L>"By one blest effort seal thy triumphs past,</L>
<L>"And gain thy promis'd guerdon in the last."</L>
<L>As thus she spake, her heavenly arms embrac'd,</L>
<L N="110">And in the car the conscious Maiden plac'd.</L>
<L>Quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend,</L>
<L>No clouds impede them, wheresoe'er they bend.</L>
<L>As thro' the empire of the winds they rush'd,</L>
<L>The winds were all in mute submission hush'd;</L>
<L N="115">And now SERENA, from th' exalted car,</L>
<L>Look'd down, astonish'd, on each sinking star;</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="124"/>Flying o'er lucid orbs, whose distant light</L>
<L>Yet has not reach'd the scope of human sight:</L>
<L>And now, not distant from the bounds of Space,</L>
<L N="120">The guardian Sprite suspends their rapid race;</L>
<L>And, while in deep amaze the Nymph admires</L>
<L>The circling meteors' inoffensive fires,</L>
<L>Pleas'd at her wonder, the mild Power addrest,</L>
<L>With kind intelligence, her earthly guest:—</L>
<L N="125">"Of those three Orbs, that in yon chrystal sphere</L>
<L>"A separate system in themselves appear,</L>
<L>"The last, whose luminous and steady form</L>

<L>"Contains my palace, and the gentle train</L>
<L N="120">"Whom I have wafted to this pure domain.</L>
<L>"At equal distance my dominions lie</L>
<L>"From these two larger worlds, more near thine eye:</L>
<L>"Observe their difference as our wheels advance,</L>
<L>"And passing, take of each a transient glance."</L>
<L N="135">So speaking, to the grosser globe she sprung,</L>
<L>Her car suspended o'er its surface hung,</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="125"/>In heavy air; for round this orb was roll'd</L>
<L>A circling vapour, dull, and damp, and cold.</L>
<L>"Here," says SOPHROSYNE, "those Beings dwell,</L>
<L N="140">"Who wanted soul to act or ill or well;</L>
<L>"Who saunter'd thoughtless thro' their mortal time,</L>
<L>"Without a Care, a Virtue, or a Crime:</L>
<L>"Here still they saunter, in this languid scene;</L>
<L>"But pass the dozing crowd, and mark their Queen."</L>
<L N="145">And now, slow riding on a Tortoise' back,</L>
<L>Her features lifeless, and each fibre slack,</L>
<L>Full in their view the Nymph Indifference came;</L>
<L>The quick SERENA soon perceiv'd her name;</L>
<L>For, as in solemn creeping state she rode,</L>
<L N="150">In her lax hand she held fair GREVILLE's Ode.</L>
<L>Ne'er did the Muse from her sweet treasure cull</L>
<L>Incense so precious for a Power so dull.</L>
<L>Still, as she mov'd along her even way,</L>
<L>The heavy Goddess try'd to read the lay;</L>
<L N="155">But at each pause her inattentive eye</L>
<L>Stray'd from the paper, which she held awry;</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="126"/>Nor could her lips a single line repeat,</L>
<L>Tho' the soft Verse, most ravishingly sweet,</L>
<L>Thro' Time's dull ear will lasting pleasure spread,</L>
<L N="160">And charm the poppy from Oblivion's head.</L>
<L>Thus like a City Mayor, whose heavy barge</L>
<L>Steers its dull progress at the public charge,</L>
<L>This Power, so cumber'd by her empire's weight,</L>
<L>Makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state.</L>
<L N="165">Around her, tribes of rambling Sceptics crawl,</L>
<L>Tho' moving, dubious if they move at all.</L>
<L>Before her, languid Pomp, her Marshal, creeps,</L>
<L>Whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps:</L>
<L>Its quaint device her dull dominion spoke—</L>
<L N="170">An Eagle, numb'd by the Torpedo's stroke.</L>
<L>"Enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul,"</L>
<L>SOPHROSYNE exclaim'd; "from this dark goal</L>
<L>"Pass we to regions opposite to this."</L>
<L>She spoke; and, darting o'er the wide abyss,</L>
<L N="175">Her car, like lightning in soft flashes hurl'd,</L>
<L>Shot to the confines of a clearer world.</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="127"/>Now lovelier views the Virgin's mind absorb;</L>
<L>For now they hover'd o'er a lucid orb.</L>
<L>Here the soft air, luxuriantly warm,</L>
<L N="180">Imparts new lustre to SERENA's form:</L>
<L>Her eyes with more expressive radiance speak,</L>
<L>And richer roses open on her cheek.</L>
<L>Here, as she gaz'd, she felt in every vein</L>
<L>A blended thrill of pleasure and of pain;</L>
<L N="185">Yet every object opening to her view,</L>
<L>Her quick regard with soft attraction drew.</L>
<L>SOPHROSYNE, who saw the gentle Fair</L>
<L>Lean o'er these confines with peculiar care,</L>
<L>Smil'd at the tender interest she display'd,</L>
<L N="190">And spoke regardful of the pensive Maid:</L>
<L>"Well may'st thou bend o'er this congenial sphere;</L>
<L>"For Sensibility is Sovereign here.</L>
<L>"Thou seest her train of sprightly damsels sport,</L>
<L>"Where the soft Spirit holds her rural court:</L>
<L N="195">"But fix thine eye attentive to the plain,</L>
<L>"And mark the varying wonders of her reign."</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="128"/>As thus she spoke, she pois'd her airy seat</L>
<L>High o'er a plain exhaling every sweet;</L>
<L>For round its precincts all the flowers that bloom</L>
<L N="200">Fill'd the delicious air with rich perfume;</L>
<L>And in the midst a verdant throne appear'd,</L>
<L>In simplest form by graceful Fancy rear'd,</L>
<L>And deck'd with flowers, not such whose flaunting dyes</L>
<L>Strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes;</L>
<L N="205">But those wild herbs that tenderest fibres bear,</L>
<L>And shun th' approaches of a damper air.</L>
<L>Here stood the lovely Ruler of the scene,</L>
<L>And Beauty, more than Pomp, announc'd the Queen.</L>
<L>The bending Snow-drop, and the Briar-rose,</L>
<L N="210">The simple circle of her crown compose;</L>
<L>Roses of every hue her robe adorn,</L>
<L>Except th' insipid Rose without a thorn.</L>
<L>Thro' her thin vest her heighten'd beauties shine;</L>
<L>For earthly gauze was never half so fine.</L>
<L N="215">Of that enchanting age her figure seems,</L>
<L>When smiling Nature with the vital beams</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="129"/>Of vivid Youth, and Pleasure's purple flame,</L>
<L>Gilds her accomplish'd work, the Female frame,</L>
<L>With rich luxuriance tender, sweetly wild,</L>
<L N="220">And just between the Woman and the Child.</L>
<L>Her fair left arm around a vase she flings,</L>
<L>From which the tender plant Mimosa springs:</L>
<L>Towards its leaves, o'er which she fondly bends,</L>
<L>The youthful Fair her vacant hand extends</L>
<L N="225">With gentle motion, anxious to survey</L>
<L>How far the feeling fibres own her sway:</L>
<L>The leaves, as conscious of their Queen's command,</L>
<L>Successive fall at her approaching hand;</L>
<L>While her soft breast with pity seems to pant,</L>
<L N="230">And shrinks at every shrinking of the plant.</L>
<L>Around their Sovereign, on the verdant ground,</L>
<L>Sweet airy Forms in mystic measures bound.</L>
<L>The mighty master of the revel, Love,</L>
<L>In notes more soothing than his mother's Dove,</L>
<L N="235">Prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing,</L>
<L>Or sportive trips around the frolic ring,</L>
<L><PB N="117" REF="130"/>Coupling, with radiant wreaths of lambent fire,</L>
<L>Fair fluttering Hope and rapturous Desire.</L>
<L>Unnumber'd damsels different charms display,</L>
<L N="240">Pensive with bliss, or in their pleasures gay;</L>
<L>And the wide prospect yields one touching sight</L>
<L>Of tender, yet diversified delight.</L>
<L>But, the bright triumphs of their joy to check,</L>
<L>In the clear air there hangs a dusky speck;</L>
<L N="245">It swells—it spreads—and rapid, as it grows,</L>
<L>O'er the gay scene a chilling shadow throws.</L>
<L>The soft SERENA, who beheld its flight,</L>
<L>Suspects no evil from a cloud so light;</L>
<L>For harmless round her the thin vapours wreath,</L>
<L N="250">Not hiding from her view the scene beneath;</L>
<L>But ah! too soon, with Pity's tender pain,</L>
<L>She saw its dire effect o'er all the plain:</L>
<L>Sudden from thence the sounds of Anguish flow,</L>
<L>And Joy's sweet carols end in shrieks of woe:</L>
<L N="255">The wither'd flowers are fall'n, that bloom'd so fair,</L>
<L>And poison all the pestilential air.</L>
<L><PB N="118" REF="131"/>From the rent earth dark Demons force their way,</L>
<L>And make the sportive revellers their prey.</L>
<L>Here gloomy Terror, with a shadowy rope,</L>
<L N="260">Seems, like a Turkish Mute, to strangle Hope;</L>
<L>There jealous Fury drowns in blood the fire</L>
<L>That sparkled in the eye of young Desire;</L>
<L>And lifeless Love lets merciless Despair</L>
<L>From his crush'd frame his bleeding pinions tear.</L>
<L N="265">But pangs more cruel, more intensely keen,</L>
<L>Wound and distract their sympathetic Queen:</L>
<L>With fruitless tears she o'er their misery bends;</L>
<L>From her sweet brow the thorny Rose she rends,</L>
<L>And, bow'd by Grief's insufferable weight,</L>
<L N="270">Frantic she curses her immortal state:</L>
<L>The soft SERENA, as this curse she hears,</L>
<L>Feels her bright eye suffus'd with kindred tears;</L>
<L>And her kind breast, where quick compassion swell'd,</L>
<L>Shar'd in each bitter suffering she beheld.</L>
<L N="275">The guardian Power survey'd her lovely grief,</L>
<L>And spoke in gentle terms of mild relief:</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="132"/>"For this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss,</L>
<L>"And know their pains are transient as their bliss:</L>

<L>"Both interwoven with so nice an art,</L>
<L>"No power can tear the twisted threads apart:</L>

<L>"Than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere,</L>
<L N="285">"Where her warm wishes, and affections kind,</L>
<L>"Lose their bright current in the stagnant mind.</L>
<L>"Here grief and joy so suddenly unite,</L>
<L>"That anguish serves to sublimate delight."</L>
<L>She spoke; and, ere SERENA could reply,</L>
<L N="290">The vapour vanish'd from the lucid sky;</L>
<L>The Nymphs revive, the shadowy Fiends are fled,</L>
<L>The new-born flowers a richer fragrance shed;</L>
<L>The gentle Ruler of the changeful land,</L>

<L>While, on the lovely Queen's enchanting face,</L>

<L>Now, laughing Sport, from the enlighten'd plain,</L>

<L>Fondly she gaz'd, till the inchanting sound</L>

<L>While her instinctive car's obedient frame</L>

<L N="175"><PB N="148" REF="161"/>If he, with grief, has seen the faithless heat</L>
<L>Marr the rich labour it should make compleat,</L>
<L>When next his hands, with trembling care, confide</L>

<L>Watches unceasing the pernicious flame,</L>
<L N="180">Terror and Hope contending in his frame,</L>
<L>While his fair work the dangerous fire sustains,</L>
<L>Feels it in all his sympathetic veins,</L>
<L>And at each trivial sound that Chance may cause,</L>
<L>Hears the Gem crack, and sees its cruel flaws:</L>
<L N="185">With such solicitude the panting Maid</L>
<L>Past the long street, of every noise afraid.</L>
<L>Now, while around her rival flambeaus flare,</L>
<L>And the coach rattles thro' the crowded square,</L>
<L>She fears some dire mischance must yet befall,</L>
<L N="190">Some Demon snatch her from the promis'd Ball;</L>

<L N="195"><PB N="149" REF="162"/>But, whirl'd at length within the Porter's gate,</L>
<L>She thinks what perils at the Ball may wait;</L>
<L>And, as she now alights, the fluttering Fair</L>
<L>Invokes her Guardian to protect her there,</L>

<L N="200">Before the magic blaze that meets her eye.</L>
<L>Th' advancing Nymph, at every step she takes,</L>
<L>Pants with amazement, doubtful if she wakes;</L>
<L>Far as her eyes the glittering scene command,</L>
<L>'Tis all enchantment, all a Fairy land;</L>
<L N="205">No vestiges of modern pomp appear,</L>
<L>No modern melody salutes her ear:</L>

<L>And its transmuted form to Fancy brings</L>
<L>The rich <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Views of this Palace in Swinburn's Travels.</NOTE> Alhambra of the Moorish kings.</L>
<L N="210">The Peer, who keenly thirsts for Fashion's praise,</L>
<L>To gild his revel with no common rays,</L>
<L>Summon'd his modish Architect, whose skill</L>
<L>Can all the wishes of Caprice fulfil.</L>
<L><PB N="150" REF="163"/>His genius, equal to the wildest task,</L>
<L N="215">Gave to the house itself a Gothic mask.</L>
<L>The Chaplain, that no guest might feel neglect,</L>
<L>As a Magician of the Arab sect,</L>
<L>Wav'd a presiding wand throughout the Ball,</L>
<L>And well provided for the wants of all.</L>
<L N="220">The Peer himself, his prowess to evince,</L>
<L>Shines in the semblance of a Moorish Prince;</L>
<L>And round the brilliant mimic Hero wait</L>
<L>All pomp and circumstance of Moorish state:</L>
<L>Thro' all his splendid dome no eye could find</L>
<L N="225">Aught unembellish'd, save the Master's mind.</L>
<L>There, tho' represt by Courtesy's controul,</L>
<L>Lurks the low rover of the little soul,</L>
<L>Mean Vanity; whose slave can never prove</L>
<L>The heart-refining flame of genuine love.</L>
<L N="230">While her cold joys his abject mind amuse,</L>
<L>His thoughts are busied on connubial views.</L>
<L>His house compleat, its decorations plac'd</L>
<L>By the sure hand of fashionable Taste,</L>
<L><PB N="151" REF="164"/>He only wants, to crown his modish life,</L>
<L N="235">That last and finest moveable—a Wife.</L>
<L>She too must prove, to fix his coy desire,</L>
<L>Such as the eye of Fashion will admire.</L>
<L>His Ball is but a jury, to decide</L>
<L>Upon the merit of his fancied Bride.</L>
<L N="240">If sweet SERENA, on this signal night,</L>
<L>Shines the first idol of the public sight;</L>
<L>If Gallantry's fixt eyes pronounce her fair,</L>
<L>By the sure sign of one unceasing stare;</L>
<L>And if, prophetic of her nobler doom,</L>
<L N="245">Each rival Beauty shudders at her bloom;</L>
<L>The die is cast—he weds—the point is clear;</L>
<L>She cannot slight the vows of such a Peer.</L>
<L>Thus argued in his mind the festive Earl,</L>
<L>And, lest he lightly chuse an awkward Girl,</L>
<L N="250">Wisely conven'd, on this important case,</L>
<L>Each fashionable judge of Female grace.</L>
<L>Here Beaux Esprits in various figures lurk,</L>
<L>Of Jew and Gentile, Bramin, Tartar, Turk;</L>
<L><PB N="152" REF="165"/>But of the manly Masks, a youthful Bard</L>
<L N="255">Seem'd most to challenge Beauty's soft regard:</L>
<L>Adorn'd with native elegance, he wore,</L>
<L>In simplest form, the minstrel dress of yore:</L>
<L>They call him EDWIN, who around him throng,</L>
<L>EDWIN, immortaliz'd in BEATTIE's song;</L>
<L N="260">And, sooth to say, within a comely frame,</L>
<L>He bore a heart that answer'd to the name;</L>
<L>For this neat habit deck'd a generous Youth,</L>
<L>Of gentlest manners, and sincerest truth.</L>
<L>Tho' on his birth propitious Fortune smil'd,</L>
<L N="265">No proud parental folly spoil'd the Child;</L>
<L>And Genius, more beneficently kind,</L>
<L>Blest with superior wealth his manly mind.</L>
<L>Of years he barely counted twenty-one;</L>
<L>But, like a brilliant morn, his opening life begun.</L>
<L N="270">Fain would the Muse on this her votary dwell,</L>
<L>And fully paint the Youth she loves so well;</L>
<L>His figure's charms, the music of his tongue,</L>
<L>What Nymphs his lays allur'd, what lays he sung:</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="166"/>But higher cares her rambling song controul;</L>
<L N="275">SERENA's perils summon all her soul;</L>
<L>For Spleen, ambitious to exert her force,</L>
<L>Conscious this trial is her last resource,</L>
<L>Most keenly bent on her pernicious task,</L>
<L>Has shifted round the Ball from mask to mask,</L>
<L N="280">Watching the moment, with infernal care,</L>
<L>To form with deepest art her final snare,</L>
<L>And manacle the mind of the unguarded Fair.</L>
<L>It comes, the moment that must fix her lot,</L>
<L>By her, ah thoughtless Maid! by her forgot;</L>
<L N="285">Tho' the light Hours, e'en in their frolic ring,</L>
<L>Trembling perceive the fearful chance they bring,</L>
<L>And, shuddering at the Nymph's terrific state,</L>
<L>Seem anxious to suspend her doubtful fate.</L>
<L>Now social Ease the place of Sport supplied,</L>
<L N="290">The hot oppressive mask was thrown aside,</L>
<L>And Beauty shone reveal'd in all her blushing pride.</L>
<L>Superior still in features as in form,</L>
<L>With admiration flush'd, with pleasure warm,</L>
<L><PB N="154" REF="167"/>The gay SERENA every eye allur'd;</L>
<L N="295">The hearts her figure won her face secur'd:</L>
<L>A tender sweetness still the Nymph maintain'd,</L>
<L>And Modesty o'er all her graces reign'd.</L>
<L>Well might her soul to brilliant hopes incline,</L>
<L>A thousand Youths had call'd her charms divine;</L>
<L N="300">A thousand friends had whisper'd in her ear,</L>
<L>That Fate had mark'd her for the festive Peer.</L>
<L>Her youthful fancy, tho' by pomp amus'd,</L>
<L>Wish'd not those offers, which her heart refus'd:</L>
<L>That tender heart, by no vain pride possest,</L>
<L N="305">With indecisive trembling shook her breast,</L>
<L>Like a young bird, that, fluttering in the air,</L>
<L>Wishes to build her nest, yet knows not where.</L>
<L>The busy Earl, his puny love to raise,</L>
<L>Hunted the circling whisper of her praise;</L>
<L N="310">Heard Envy own her lovely charms, tho' loth,</L>
<L>Heard Taste attest them with a modish oath;</L>
<L>And, nuptial projects thickening in his mind,</L>
<L>Now his fair partner in the dance rejoin'd.</L>
<L><PB N="155" REF="168"/>As now the sprightly music paus'd, my Lord</L>
<L N="315">Eager resolv'd to touch a softer chord;</L>
<L>Secure of all repulse, he vainly meant</L>
<L>Half to display, half hide his fond intent,</L>
<L>And, in dissembled Passion's flowery tropes,</L>
<L>To sport at leisure with the Virgin's hopes:</L>
<L N="320">For this he fram'd a motley speech, replete</L>
<L>With amorous compliment and vain conceit.</L>
<L>The labour'd nothing with complacent pride</L>
<L>He spoke; but to his speech no Nymph replied:</L>
<L>For in the moment, the lost Fair devotes</L>
<L N="325">Her willing ear to more attractive notes.</L>
<L>The Minstrel happen'd near the Nymph to walk,</L>
<L>Rapt with a bosom-friend in secret talk,</L>
<L>And, at the instant when the Earl began</L>
<L>Half to unfold his matrimonial plan,</L>
<L N="330">EDWIN, in whispers, from the crowd retir'd,</L>
<L>Chanc'd to repeat the Sonnet she inspir'd:</L>
<L>The sounds, tho' faint, her recollection caught,</L>
<L>Drew her quick eye, and fixt her wondering thought.</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="169"/>Lost in this sweet surprize, she could not hear</L>
<L N="335">A single accent of the amorous Peer.</L>
<L>Spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain,</L>
<L>And perch'd triumphant on the Noble's brain.</L>
<L>With jealous Envy stung, and baffled Pride,</L>
<L>"Contemptuous Girl!" with sudden rage he cried,</L>
<L N="340">"If here to happier Youths thy views incline,</L>
<L>"I want not fairer Nymphs who challenge mine.</L>
<L>"Thy breast in vain with penitence may burn;</L>
<L>"But, once neglected, I no more return."</L>
<L>Thus loudly speaking, with distemper'd heat,</L>
<L N="345">Rudely he turn'd, with rancorous scorn replete.</L>
<L>SERENA, startled at th' injurious sound,</L>
<L>Survey'd th' insulting Peer, who sternly frown'd;</L>
<L>Shame and resentment thro' her bosom rush,</L>
<L>Swell every vein, and raise the burning blush.</L>
<L N="350">Love, new-born Love, but in its birth conceal'd,</L>
<L>Nor to the Nymph herself as yet reveal'd,</L>
<L>And just Disdain, and Anger's honest flame,</L>
<L>With complicated power convulse her frame:</L>
<L><PB N="157" REF="170"/>Contending passions every thought confound,</L>
<L N="355">And in tumultuous doubt her soul is drown'd.</L>
<L>Now treacherous Pride, who tempts her tongue to trip,</L>
<L>Forms to a keen reply her quivering lip:</L>
<L>Insidious Spleen now hovers o'er the Fair,</L>
<L>Deems her half lock'd within her hateful snare;</L>
<L N="360">In her new slave preparing to rejoice,</L>
<L>To taint her spirit, and untune her voice.</L>
<L>Hapless SERENA! what can save thee now?</L>
<L>The Fiend's dark signet stamps thy clouded brow,</L>
<L>In thy swoln eye I see the starting drop;</L>
<L N="365">This fatal shower, aetherial Guardian! stop:</L>
<L>Haste to thy votary, haste, her soul sustain,</L>
<L>Nor let the trials she has past be vain.</L>
<L>Ah me! while yet I speak, with shuddering dread</L>
<L>I hear the magic Girdle's bursting thread.</L>
<L N="370">This horrid omen, ye kind Powers! avert:</L>
<L>Nor thou, bright Zone! thy brighter Charge desert.</L>
<L>Ah, fruitless prayer! her panting breast behold!</L>
<L>See! the gauze shakes in many a ruffled fold!</L>
<L><PB N="158" REF="171"/>Forc'd from their station by her heaving heart,</L>
<L N="375">From the strain'd Girdle thrice three spangles start:</L>
<L>Thro' her disorder'd dress a pass they've found,</L>
<L>And fallen, see, they glitter on the ground!</L>
<L>O blessed chance! with life-recalling light</L>
<L>The glittering monitors attract her sight!</L>
<L N="380">Like stars emerging from the darken'd pole,</L>
<L>They sparkle safety to her harrass'd soul.</L>
<L>See! from her brow the clouds of trouble fly,</L>
<L>Vexation's tear is vanish'd from her eye!</L>
<L>Her rosy cheeks with Joy's soft radiance burn,</L>
<L N="385">Like Nature smiling at the Sun's return;</L>
<L>The Nymph, no more with mental darkness blind,</L>
<L>Shines the sweet Ruler of her rescu'd mind.</L>
<L>Hence, hateful Spleen! thy fancied prize resign,</L>
<L>Renounce for ever what shall ne'er be thine;</L>
<L N="390">For, conscious of her airy Guardian's aid,</L>
<L>She feels new spirit thro' her heart convey'd,</L>
<L>And, inly blessing this victorious hour,</L>
<L>Her soul exults in its recover'd power.</L>
<L><PB N="159" REF="172"/>In such mild terms she hails th' insulting Peer,</L>
<L N="395">As Spleen, if mortal, must expire to hear;</L>
<L>But, driven for ever from the lovely Girl,</L>
<L>The foul Fiend riots in the captive Earl.</L>
<L>He answers not; but, with a sullen air,</L>
<L>On happier EDWIN, who approach'd the Fair,</L>
<L N="400">Darts such a glance of rage and envious hate,</L>
<L>As Satan cast on Eden's blissful state,</L>
<L>When on our Parents first he fixt his sight,</L>
<L>And undelighted gaz'd on all delight:</L>
<L>So doom'd to look, and doom'd such pangs to feel,</L>
<L N="405">Scornful he turn'd on his elastic heel.</L>
<L>"O lovely Mildness! oh angelic Maid!</L>
<L>"Deserving homage, tho' to scorn betray'd;</L>
<L>"Rise still, sweet Spirit, rise these wrongs above,</L>
<L>"Turn from injurious Pride to faithful Love;</L>
<L N="410">"Tho' on my brow no Coronet may shine,</L>
<L>"Wealth I can offer at thy beauty's shrine,</L>
<L>"And, worthier thee, a heart that worships thine."</L>
<L><PB N="160" REF="173"/>Thus, with new-kindled Love's aspiring flame,</L>
<L>Spoke the fond Youth conceal'd by EDWIN's name,</L>
<L N="415">The gallant FALKLAND, rich in inborn worth,</L>
<L>By Fortune blest, and not of abject birth.</L>
<L>Warmly he spoke, with that indignant heat</L>
<L>With which the generous heart ne'er fails to beat,</L>
<L>When Worth insulted wakens virtuous ire,</L>
<L N="420">And injur'd Beauty sets the soul on fire.</L>
<L>Quick to his voice the startled Virgin turn'd,</L>
<L>With wonder, hope, and joy, her bosom burn'd;</L>
<L>With sweet confusion, flurried and amaz'd,</L>
<L>On his attractive form she wildly gaz'd.</L>
<L N="425">Full on her thought the friendly visions rush'd;</L>
<L>Blushing she view'd him, view'd him still and blush'd;</L>
<L>And, soft Affection quickening at the sight,</L>
<L>Perchance had swoon'd with fullness of delight,</L>
<L>But that her Father's voice, with quick controul,</L>
<L N="430">Recall'd the functions of her fainting soul,</L>
<L>When on the distant seat, where, fondly fixt,</L>
<L>He view'd the Nymph as in the dance she mixt,</L>
<L><PB N="161" REF="174"/>He indistinctly heard, with wounded ear,</L>
<L>The spleenful outrage of the angry Peer.</L>
<L N="435">Swift at th' imperfect sound, with choler wild,</L>
<L>He sprung to succour his insulted Child;</L>
<L>But ere his fury into language broke,</L>
<L>Love calm'd the storm that Arrogance awoke.</L>
<L>The sudden burst of FALKLAND's tender flame,</L>
<L N="440">His winning manners, his distinguish'd name,</L>
<L>His liberal soul, by Fortune's smile carest,</L>
<L>All join'd to harmonize the Father's breast.</L>
<L>His fiery thoughts subside in glad surprize,</L>
<L>And to the generous Youth he warmly cries:</L>
<L N="445">"Ingenuous FALKLAND! by thy frankness won,</L>
<L>"My willing heart would own thee as my Son;</L>
<L>"But on thy hopes SERENA must decide:—</L>
<L>"Haste we together from this house of Pride."</L>
<L>So spoke the Sire; for, to her Votary kind,</L>
<L N="450">SOPHROSYNE inspir'd his soften'd mind,</L>
<L>Speaking, he smil'd, to see that on his word</L>
<L>The Lover hung, and blest the sounds he heard;</L>
<L>That his embarrass'd Child his sentence caught</L>
<L>With each tumultuous sign of tender thought;</L>
<L N="455"><PB N="162" REF="175"/>Whose blushes, springing from the heart, declare</L>
<L>The dawn of fondness in the modest Fair.</L>
<L>Th' enchanted Youth with ecstacy convey'd</L>
<L>Forth from the troubled Feast the trembling Maid.</L>
<L>As the keen Sailor, whom his daring soul</L>
<L N="460">Has drawn, too vent'rous, near the freezing pole;</L>
<L>Who, having slighted Caution's tame advice,</L>
<L>Seems wedg'd within impervious worlds of ice;</L>
<L>If, from each chilling form of peril free,</L>
<L>At length he reach the unincumber'd sea,</L>
<L N="465">With joy superior to his transient pain,</L>
<L>Rushes, exulting, o'er th' expansive main:</L>
<L>Such strong delight SERENA's bosom shar'd,</L>
<L>When sweet Reflection to her heart declar'd,</L>
<L>That all the trials of her Fate were past,</L>
<L N="470">And Love's decisive plaudit seal'd the last.</L>
<L>Her airy Guard prepares the softest down,</L>
<L>From Peace's wing, to line the nuptial crown:</L>
<L>Her smiles accelerate the bridal morn,</L>
<L>And clear her Votary's path from every thorn.</L>
<L N="475">On the quick match the Prude's keen censures fall,</L>
<L>Blind to the heavenly Power who guided all;</L>
<L><PB N="163" REF="176"/>But mild SERENA scorn'd the prudish play,</L>
<L>To wound warm Love with frivolous delay;</L>
<L>Nature's chaste child, not Affectation's slave,</L>
<L N="480">The heart she meant to give, she frankly gave.</L>
<L>Thro' her glad Sire no gouty humours run,</L>
<L>Jocund he glories in his destin'd Son.</L>
<L>PENELOPE herself, no longer seen</L>
<L>In the four semblance of tormenting Spleen,</L>
<L N="485">Buys for her Niece the robes of nuptial state,</L>
<L>Nor scolds the Mercer once thro' all the long debate.</L>
<L>For quick dispatch, the honest Man of law,</L>
<L>Toils half the night the legal ties to draw;</L>
<L>At length th' enraptur'd Youth, all forms compleat,</L>
<L N="490">Bears his sweet Bride to his paternal feat;</L>
<L>On a fair lawn the chearful mansion stood,</L>
<L>And high behind it rose a circling wood.</L>
<L>As the blest Lord of this extensive reign</L>
<L>Led his dear partner thro' her new domain,</L>
<L N="495">With fond surprize, SERENA soon descried</L>
<L>A temple rais'd to her aetherial Guide.</L>
<L>Its ornaments she view'd with tender awe,</L>
<L>Their fashion such as she in vision saw;</L>
<L><PB N="164" REF="177"/>For the kind Youth, her grateful smile to gain,</L>
<L N="500">Had, from her clear description, deck'd the fane.</L>
<L>Joyful he cried, to his angelic Wife,</L>
<L>"Be this kind Power the worship of our life!"</L>
<L>He spoke; and led her to the inmost shrine;</L>
<L>Here, link'd in rosy bands, two Votaries shine;</L>
<L N="505">The pencil had imparted life to each,</L>
<L>With energy that seem'd beyond its reach.</L>
<L>First stood Connubial Love, a manly Youth,</L>
<L>Whose bright eye spoke the ardent vows of truth;</L>
<L>Friendship, sweet smiling, fill'd the second place,</L>
<L N="510">In all the softer charms of Virgin grace.</L>
<L>Their meeting arms a mystic tablet raise,</L>
<L>Deck'd with these lines, the Moral of my Lays:—</L>
<L>"VIRTUE's an ingot of Peruvian gold,</L>
<L>"SENSE the bright ore, Potosi's mines unfold;</L>
<L N="515">"But TEMPER's image must their use create,</L>
<L>"And give these precious metals sterling weight."</L>
