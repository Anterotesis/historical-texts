<HEAD>VERSES TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF <HI>NEWCASTLE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IF yet your throbbing bosom finds relief;</L>
<L>If Reason yet one moment steals from Grief;</L>
<L>Forgive, my Lord, the Muse that late appears,</L>
<L>To join with Britain's sighs,—NEWCASTLE's tears;</L>
<L>The Muse, that joins her well intended strain,</L>
<L>With GEORGE's sacred sighs, but joins in vain.</L>
<L>Not regal sorrows can that life restore,</L>
<L>In vain the kingly fountains rich run o'er;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="020680080000030"/>'Tis hers, to join with all who truly mourn,</L>
<L>Who pour the plaintive note on PELHAM's urn.</L>
<L>Mistaken mortals in this vale below,</L>
<L>Sons of Adversity, and heirs of Woe,</L>
<L>The sad inheritance tenacious keep,</L>
<L>Too soon they triumph, or too late they weep.</L>
<L>The good possess'd, with listless hearts they rate,</L>
<L>Nor prize the bliss enjoy'd, till snatch'd by Fate;</L>
<L>Reflection then, and Gratitude conspire;</L>
<L>Then, every virtue kindles every fire;</L>
<L>The breast humane, with sudden fervour burns;</L>
<L>Then, all the soul alarm'd, regrets and mourns;</L>
<L>This tribute Virtue from the heart demands,</L>
<L>And Nature pays it with obedient hands.</L>
<L>To vice high rais'd, no hallow'd mark remains,</L>
<L>Her springs of pleasures, and her source of pains,</L>
<L>Ambition's frenzy, Lust, and Lucre fly</L>
<L>To black Obscurity; far off they lie</L>
<L><PB REF="020680080000040"/>Sunk in the mass confus'd, Oblivion's lot,</L>
<L>By Time rejected, and by Fame forgot.</L>
<L>The all-revered pile, erect to Fame,</L>
<L>With Virtue's trophies charg'd, with Trajan's name,</L>
<L>O'er vanquish'd Time shall stand, with story'd pride,</L>
<L>With each immortal witness at its side;</L>
<L>The world's applause, by classic pow'r express'd,</L>
<L>Which thunder spar'd to strike; and Goths molest!</L>
<L>O sacred Avarice! O thirst divine!</L>
<L>Th' immortal springs of paradise are thine;</L>
<L>The treasures thine in Time's diminish'd store;</L>
<L>For thou shalt claim, when he can give no more.</L>
<L>Illustrious PELHAM, to thy country dear,</L>
<L>For whom thy prince still sheds the social tear,</L>
<L>Thy honour'd worth, with lasting wreaths shall shine,</L>
<L>And ev'ry British trophy shall be thine;</L>
<L>Not Latian marble nobler praise can give,</L>
<L>In ev'ry patriot heart thy name shall live.</L>
<L><PB REF="020680080000050"/>Nor yet, Britannia, let thy bosom cease,</L>
<L>Thy beating bosom, stranger yet to peace,</L>
<L>The fatal storm that tore thy bulwark wide,</L>
<L>With dread irruption, cannot yet subside;</L>
<L>Thy agitated heart yet feels the blow,</L>
<L>And Justice must approve the grateful woe.</L>
<L>'Tis due to merit in the humblest sphere,</L>
<L>Where private virtue claims the private tear;</L>
<L>A secret transport mingles with such grief,</L>
<L>Such gen'rous sorrow brings the soul relief;</L>
<L>Reason approves, what Passion then bestows,</L>
<L>And Nature pays the debt, that Friendship owes.</L>
<L>Ah! say, what sad memorial can express</L>
<L>A people's anguish, and a king's distress!</L>
<L>Alas! what monumental mark make known</L>
<L>The sighs of millions, griev'd—a monarch's moan!</L>
<L>What equal witness shall invention find,</L>
<L>Worthy the friend of truth,—of human-kind!</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="020680080000060"/>Let Gratitude her sacred source explore,</L>
<L>Let Genius turn her treasur'd talents o'er,</L>
<L>Let Greece, let Rome bestow their rev'rend aid,</L>
<L>And rear the awful pile to PELHAM's shade.</L>
<L>Let Envy come, by factious Malice nurs'd,</L>
<L>With all her black seditious brood accurs'd,</L>
<L>Come forth at once, and witness if she can,</L>
<L>That e'er thy shadow, Fraud, eclips'd the man.</L>
<L>She growls conviction, with reluctant tone,</L>
<L>And grinds the sacred truth, she's forc'd to own.</L>
<L>The vanquish'd pest retreats, that bane of men,</L>
<L>Drove back by Truth she seeks her horrid den.</L>
<L>A statesman die, and not one arrow move!</L>
<L>Has Faction lost her nerve!—can Malice love</L>
<L>Science, Sincerity, or Truth? she can,</L>
<L>The blameless minister, the upright man:</L>
<L>Ev'n in Britannia bless'd, a length of years,</L>
<L>In whose clear conduct not one stain appears.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="020680080000070"/>And will the jarring hydra this proclaim</L>
<L>From all her hostile mouths to PELHAM's fame?</L>
<L>Thrice happy PELHAM! bless'd beyond compare,</L>
<L>Bless'd in thy life, (and what few else could share,</L>
<L>In publick station and exalted trust,)</L>
<L>Bless'd in thy death, and honour'd in the dust.</L>
<L>With WALSINGHAM, with BURLEIGH blend thy rays,</L>
<L>Equal to each in merit, as in praise.</L>
<L>O if exalted to the realms of joy,</L>
<L>Th' immortal mind one moment may employ</L>
<L>On things terrestrial, on th' affairs of men,</L>
<L>Bow down inraptur'd thy celestial ken;</L>
<L>Behold each rank, each faction, all agree,</L>
<L>(The patriot's rich reward reserv'd for thee,)</L>
<L>Alike the prince's and the peasant's tear,</L>
<L>In mingled current flowing o'er thy bier;</L>
<L>Extatic vision to the virtuous given,</L>
<L>Felt with increasing transport, tho' in heav'n.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="020680080000080"/>How wretched now from thy seraphic sphere,</L>
<L>Does Fraud, does Flatt'ry, to thy sight appear!</L>
<L>Ambition's crest how abject does it shew,</L>
<L>With Craft, with Avarice, thy scorn below!</L>
<L>How Pomp, how Pride, how Courts, to atoms shrink</L>
<L>From thy averted view! how sudden sink!</L>
<L>With gold, with grandeur, these misrated things,</L>
<L>These trappings of command, these toys of kings!</L>
<L>Whilst in some lowly cottage, Truth's retreat,</L>
<L>Neglected Virtue to thy eye looks great;</L>
<L>Th' unbody'd mind affection's force retains,</L>
<L>And friendship with the bless'd, new fervour gains,</L>
<L>Exalted fervour, free from earth's cold dross,</L>
<L>And each alloy, that sensual hearts engross;</L>
<L>Still helpful to the good, the virtuous mind,</L>
<L>Still fond, they cast the friendly wish behind.</L>
<L>Fast by the stream of life, that joyful roves</L>
<L>Through labyrinths of bliss, immortal groves,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="020680080000090"/>Thy ardent spirit feels a social care,</L>
<L>And Friendship still imprints its image there.</L>
<L>With each endearing tie through life enjoy'd,</L>
<L>With each fond object, that the heart employ'd,</L>
<L>To Science wedded, in th' abstracted bow'r,</L>
<L>To business sacred, in th' important hour;</L>
<L>When deep Experience pois'd Europa's weal,</L>
<L>When Britain's genius watch'd the varying scale,</L>
<L>And O where heart-felt raptures oft inspir'd</L>
<L>The throb reciprocal by Friendship fir'd,</L>
<L>By Sense, by Truth, by Love, by Honour taught,</L>
<L>By rip'ning Time to rich perfection brought.</L>
<L>Angels themselves might view a scene like this</L>
<L>With longing eyes, and envy human bliss.</L>
<L>Such soul-felt extasy, so deep impress'd,</L>
<L>Retains thy Cath'rine's form among the bless'd,</L>
<L>Takes off thy raptur'd thought, with tender care</L>
<L>Divides perhaps thy wishes even there.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="020680080000100"/>What mortal anguish tore each filial breast,</L>
<L>When dreadful struck, in fix'd amaze!—express'd</L>
<L>By gushing tears, when Nature felt the blow;</L>
<L>And ev'ry voice was lost in whelming woe!</L>
<L>By silent agonizing looks alone,</L>
<L>With heart-expressive force, to words unknown,</L>
<L>Sent from the agitated soul to tell,</L>
<L>That Britain lost a friend, when PELHAM fell!</L>
<L>The parent dear,—but sorrow stopt the rest,</L>
<L>And Nature sunk, beneath the load oppress'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Thou, to whom my numbers would ascend,</L>
<L>The tend'rest brother, and the noblest friend,</L>
<L>NEWCASTLE, PELHAM, patriot, loyal, true,</L>
<L>From thy fraternal eye, still falls the dew</L>
<L>Of genuine sorrow, flowing from the heart</L>
<L>That melting feels—but Britain claims her part</L>
<L>In thee; thy country now demands thy care,</L>
<L>Thy Prince to thee inclines th' attentive ear,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="020680080000110"/>By anxious thoughts and toils of state oppress'd,</L>
<L>He leans for counsel on thy faithful breast;</L>
<L>To thee his bosom's inmost weight makes known,</L>
<L>Thou firm support, thou pillar to his throne!</L>
<L>O long support him, long his cause defend,</L>
<L>Thy Prince's fav'rite and thy country's friend,</L>
<L>Another PELHAM to the grave descend.</L>
