<P>THE veneration I have for your Lady∣ship, flows, from contem∣plating the preserved pu∣rity of your <HI>conjugal</HI> cha∣racter,

encircled by a court, whose general infidelity is sanctified by the licentious taste of the times.</P>
<P>You obstinately persist in the Gothic endearments of Domestic Constancy, though adorned with all those personal graces which provoke the impertinence of the most seducing soli∣citations: and you have fortitude enough to prefer <HI>family felicity</HI> to the <HI>eti∣quette</HI> of an elopement, or the <HI>eclat</HI> of a divorce.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="5"/>After such an acknow∣ledgment, Madam, it sounds inconsistent to shield under your protection, a series of misfortunes, which arise principally from <HI>family differences.</HI> This apparent objection to your Lady∣ship's patronage, is, how∣ever, easily removed. To <HI>whom</HI> can an unfortunate pair so properly apply for sympathy, as to the virtu∣ous and sympathizing? CHARLES and CHARLOTTE are as singularly as pathe∣tically

circumstanced— Their distress is directed closely to the feeling heart — they will meet many a scornful sarcasm from the pride of <HI>pretended</HI> virtue— but from <HI>real</HI> innocence— from the COUNTESS of DERBY, they invite the re∣compence of—a Tear!—</P>

<P>GOD of heaven! Pre-determined never to enter my house again —And did the hitherto kind, gentle, affectionate Charlotte, form such a resolution; and has she had the heart to put it in practice—?

<P>I BEGAN my pursuit at five minutes past eleven in the morn∣ing, and I continued it till within a quarter of twelve at night; the cloth and dinner all that time re∣maining untouched upon the table; for I sent your sister one way, while I went another: but the labour of both hath terminated in disappoint∣ment.</P>
<P>I now catch up the pen invo∣luntarily to write to you, without knowing whither to send my letter:
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
and though convinced of this, I con∣tinue to write on. My heart is full, and I must discharge some part of its load upon paper: surely your re∣sidence will not long be a secret, and then I will send it to you.</P>
<P>Soft a little—'Tis the dead of the night, and the least alarm is heard distinctly. In the moment of ex∣pectation the soul sits in the ear, and listens to the approaches of her object—The sound of a coach wheel rolls remotely. May it bring on∣ward the treasure I have lost!</P>
<P>Flattering, fond imagination! The vehicle has past my door, and 'twas
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
in vain I threw up the sash of the window to wait its stopping.</P>
<P>Why, Charlotte, do you treat me thus? Ungrateful girl, I will retire into my chamber, and think no more about you.</P>

<P>ACCURSED is the gift of sen∣sibility. 'Tis the smart that "agonizes at every pore." Ever wretched shall the lover be, in pro∣portion to the fineness of his feelings.
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
How little to be desired is delicacy of passion! The higher degrees of tenderness are distracting; and, if the agitation I am now in should continue long, with what fervency of supplication should I pray for stoicism or apathy, or any other power that deadens the enervating softness of recollection!</P>
<P>I rise from my bed to pen this ejaculation before the dawn of the day. Ah! barbarous Charlotte, what a night have I laboured through? I had resolved to think of you no more, but my heart, unfaithful to its reso∣lutions, will admit no other ideas but those which are connected with love and Charlotte. Instantly sprang
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
the tear to my eye as I entered the solitary chamber: the late scenes of serenity and interchanged endear∣ment were now altered on the sud∣den to every thing that is dreary, every thing that is desolate: un∣pressed was the pillow, which, but the night before, administered the balm of softness to the cheek of beauty; and I found something to awaken a distressful feeling in every object that the taper exhibited to my view—The toilet was not trusted with its suspended ornaments—the chair was unoccupied which used to sustain your day-dress—but the night robes were hanging idly, and full in view, at the side of the bed: there was nobody to take them
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
down—nobody to wear them. Their mistress had deserted them. I tost about for an hour, and fretted my∣self into fatigue; an unquiet slum∣ber suceeded only to torture fancy by presenting you to me in dreams.</P>
<P>She gave you to me in colours the most glowing, attitudes the most atttacting, and situations impossible to be born. I yielded to the plea∣sures of imagination, caught her dear figure in my arms, and imprinted upon it the visionary kiss. What was my astonishment—what my an∣guish, when I awaked to the decep∣tion—? If the post of the morning does not bring me intelligence, or if affection does not prevail with you

<HEAD>LETTER X. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>I Received your packet, every sen∣tence of which was calculated to afflict me—ah forbear my beloved Charles—forbear to charm me into a relapse! you accuse me of barba∣rity, when you ought to encourage me in virtue. I have made a sacrifice my dear friend—late as it is, I have made a sacrifice to devotion, and to duty. That I may not however suf∣fer any longer the imputation of cru∣elty, I will frankly reveal to you the motive—the only motive that could prevail with me to quit the society of Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="22"/>To tell you the whole matter in a single sentence—I have seen a person who hath a greater right to Charles than Charlotte—I have seen—your wife. Ah, sir, what an interview—? unprepared for the scene, how could I sustain it? I sunk under it; and your lady triumphed in all the dig∣nity of privilege, and advantages of argument.—Surely heaven threw her in my way to shew me in blush∣ing colours to her and to myself.— We had never met before, and as the meeting was delayed for more than four years, it was by so much the more aweful and insupportable. Yet do not blame her Charles. What∣ever may have been your disagree∣ments, and however multiplied the
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
causes that led originally to your disunion, she hath still the right of a married woman, and deserves to be heard. Nor can I complain of her conduct even upon so trying an oc∣casion—she did not insult, she did not execrate: but, pursuing a much nearer way to the heart, she appeal∣ed from my passions to my sense of justice, and from my tenderness, to my truth. Oh! Charles, Charles, her pleadings were too pathetic to be re∣sisted—I took her hand and bathed it with my tears, and she followed the advantage she had gained till she ob∣tained that promise, which I have at length had the fortitude to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="24"/>Severe, I confess to you—severe, even to the verge of distraction, has been the <HI>conflict.</HI> Long I hesitated, long I remained undetermined; and even at last I have been compelled rather to stifle the rising emotions of tenderness precipitately, than act upon the calm principles of delibera∣tion.—Yet I have now been almost a week absent, and am alive: though there is a stand of coaches opposite my window (any one of which would carry me to the only man I love up∣on earth) I have had the courage to see them drive off and return, without filling a place in any one of them myself.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25"/>No longer therefore accuse a be∣haviour that challenges your admira∣tion, even while it afflicts you. My trunk, you may, if you please, for∣ward to my apartment, and my sister (who being ignorant of our real situ∣ation had better be still kept so) I would recommend you to send home to her mother in the country, where the news, neither of our separation nor its motive, may ever arrive. Be this as it may, return to you again I never can; and indeed, to shew you the impossibility of it, I have paid a voluntary visit to Cleora, your law∣ful lady, to assure her we are parted for ever. Nothing therefore remains, but that you endeavour to emulate,

<HEAD>LETTER XII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE. (After receiving the foregoing.)</HEAD>
<P>IN the agony of my heart I have equity enough to praise your he∣roism, though it is dashed with a ro∣mance that ascends to the very summit of enthusiasm. I now see my fate, and the continuance of the misery that at∣tends it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27"/>The claims of the wife, the law∣ful lady and the married woman, are all, I see, dancing their fascinations before thee.</P>
<P>Think not, Charlotte, I laugh at laws, or ridicule institutions held sa∣cred and obligatory. Dear girl, I do not laugh at them, but, in my par∣ticular case, and in others similar to mine, an ample apology is found in the dictates of nature, reason, and common sense. I will not, nor indeed am I yet calm enough, to ramble into the detail of original grievances—those grievances which produced a separation from the wife of the law, who hath now separated the wife of the soul. Suffice it to
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
say, it was a rash marriage, and soon repented on both sides: the bitterness of conjugal repentance is beyond every other poignant, and happy is it if <HI>disunion,</HI> rather than perpetuated <HI>disagreement,</HI> results from it. Is this sophistry? — Is this casuistry? no Charlotte, it is simple, didactic ar∣gument, ratified by unprejudiced rea∣son, and stampt with the sanction of unbigotted sense—I feel as nicely as yourself the force of virtue, and the elegant triumphs of unspotted cha∣racter, but I see no reason why those, who, upon the evidence of more than two years experience, are unsuited to each other, "join'd, not match'd," should live janglingly together, merely to pull the tight cord of a con∣nexion
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
at different ends, and exist miserably under the same roof, for the meagre satisfaction of having it to say, we fight it out friendly, with∣out parting.</P>
<P>Egregious folly! and superstition and slavery in their extremes! you know the whole matter: my situati∣on has been often delineated to you, and I will only desire you to reflect attentively upon it, before I obey your cruel request in relation to your trunk. Ah, Charlotte, how can I bear to see those several ornaments purchased by my own hand in the ostentatious fondness of shewing you to the admiring public as the pro∣perty of your constant protector—
<PB N="24" REF="30"/>
how can I bear to see these depart into any other dressing-room but that which belongs to you, and in which they are now waiting the return of her who honours them in the wear∣ing. My dear, dear companion, it must not be: the laws of love and life, and reciprocated conjunction of hearts and minds forbid it. Think better—oh, think better of it—throw aside the rigour of those resolutions which can produce no good, and ad∣mit those receiv'd ideas which will soften this unnecessary severity, and direct you to the sighing bosom, and open arms of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ASK your pardon for detaining any part of your property after it was so peremptorily demanded. I have however now, though late, made re∣stitution of every thing which either your sister's industry or mine, could find about your apartments—I have seen, madam, the trunk containing your dresses, and decorations carried upon the shoulders of a porter, coffin like; and had it been <HI>indeed</HI> your cof∣fin my despair would have been only one degree superior. Heavy as it is,
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
with what a joy should I have stooped to the burden, and been myself the messenger; while the insensible ath∣letic animal who is now such, will be intent only upon the profits of his message, and view only with a vul∣gar amazement, the form of the fair tyrant who rejects her conquest, and and yet holds in chains her captive.</P>
<P>Your concluding sentiment enters a caveat against further argument, and shortens my letter. It is not, I perceive, the force of virtuous prin∣ciples drives you from me only, but the poison of aversion you have con∣ceived for those open arms to which you were so tenderly, though I confess so officiously invited. Fear not, I
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
beseech you madam, the shortness of your life upon my account; it is in no danger from that quarter, and I do not doubt but your health and spirits will continue to encrease in proportion to the length of your ab∣sence.</P>
<P>The point is plain enough, and I am sorry your delicacy and ingenuity have been put to such a strait for an expedient. How extremely-<HI>á-pro∣pos</HI> was your interview with Cleora! and how sincerely do I congratulate you upon the lucky crisis in which it has united inclination and duty. I perceive they have gone in this affair, like friends, well, but unexpectedly met, hand in hand together. Four
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
years possession, is I must own enough to <HI>poison</HI> any body, and it is only for such constant fools as Charles to in∣crease his passion, by gratifying it. I again beg your pardon, and promise to trespass no more upon that time, which you are no doubt employing in more agreeable engagements than reading the letters of a <HI>cast</HI> lover— perhaps the present hour is enlivened by the charms of a new acquaint∣ance, and it may be, in the delirium of female vivacity upon the dear sub∣ject of liberty restored—that <HI>paradise regained</HI> to the soul of a woman— the name, I say, and infirmity of the neglected Charles may give additional zest to sprightliness, and enhance the
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
entertainment of a delicious <HI>tête-á-tête.</HI></P>
<P>The victor, I must own, hath a right to imitate the barbarism of Achilles, and draw at the tail of his chariot the corpse of conquest. At this I shall not pretend to cavil. 'Tis the prescriptive right of the ty∣rant, and the slave must submit. But if there exists any <HI>man</HI> in the crea∣tion hardy enough to <HI>partake</HI> your conquest, and to express the impu∣dence of exultation over it—if such a one there is madam, let <HI>him</HI> trem∣ble—for nothing but his life shall pa∣cify my heart, or atone for the sport he has made of my weakness, or my sensibility.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, indeed, Sir, you have nobly exerted yourself, and I ought to express to you my thanks for taking the only method that could make me forget you. Were I not inexcusably weak I <HI>should</HI> do this, but I own you have wounded me: I own that your several sar∣casms have gone where you directed them—into the recesses of my heart. Most ungenerous Charles, to inter∣pret that action into the most mer∣cenary meanness, which, I summon the great God that inspired it, to witness, proceeded from principle.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38"/>No, Sir; my spirits and health (if I may judge of the future, by the present) are <HI>not</HI> likely to be re∣stored to me in proportion to the length of my absence: nor was the abruptness of my departure the ef∣fort of so much ingenuity as you may be pleased to imagine.—</P>
<P>If you are yet capable of doing justice, I desire you to reflect on the various struggles I have at different times had since the commencement of our connection, upon the point that now carried me for ever from you! Even before I saw the lawful Cleora I shed many a tear, and heaved many a sigh at the thought of that injury I was every hour
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
committing against her. Nay, did I not twice before, even in the warmest transports of our tenderness, bring myself to the resolution of leaving you? You pursued, persuaded, pre¦vailed, and brought me back to guilty pleasures. Seeing the life of Charles bound up in the society of Charlotte, I endeavoured again to reconcile myself to my situation. I even adopted, in some degree, the sophistry of your own sentiments. I argued, as an apology, the innocence of my intention; the hearty desire I had to serve your family, the gra∣titude I owe to the man, who im∣proved my understanding and a∣dorned my manners: and, in short, I took refuge in a thousand plau∣sibilities,
<PB N="34" REF="40"/>
rather than be torn on the rack of reflection, and leave a so∣ciety so inexpressibly dear to me.</P>
<P>Auspicious to the scheme of for∣getfulness, it was about this time you know, Sir, that we began our ex∣cursions, and took the different tours of England, Ireland, and Scotland. The improvements I made in the course of these journies, the serenity of the seasons in which they were, for the most part, performed, and the attracting benefits of so inge∣nious a companion as Charles, sus∣pended for a while the kneener sense of an illicit connection. Yet, in the very bosom of bliss I was never so dull as not to know that it
<PB N="35" REF="41"/>
<HI>was</HI> an illicit one; and therefore, proper to be broken. To break it, nevertheless, was far beyond the fee∣bleness of my power. The idea of Charles and all his fascinating qua∣lities, mixt with every image, and made the leading feature of every figure that was formed by the soul. In repugnance to the conduct I ought to have pursued, I called to my aid all the seductions of imagination, and, when <HI>they</HI> failed, I derived the comforts of self-delusion, even from the pictures of truth—Is he not, said I, industrious to justify my error, while I soothed my passion; is he not the man, who took me up in a more than orphan state, and proved himself to me a father and a friend?
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
Did he not find me a ruined crea∣ture—a poor unfortunate wanderer, who had been just deserted by the villain lord, who, taking advantage of simplicity had robbed my inno∣cence, and turned me unprovided upon the world—? Ought I not to bless the accident then that threw me in the way of this affectionate protector? From what irremediable misery may he not have saved me? How indefatigable has been his ten∣derness? How assiduous his efforts to support me? How anxious and unre∣mitting his wishes and labours to place me in a way of supporting myself, against that day in which he might want life to exert himself? Was not this my first preceptor?
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
Wanting the attentions of a parent, and an early victim to my credulity, did he not find me stepping into the very border of female violation? Was not our first interview in the very momentous crisis of a woman's fate; and was I not weeping, in the bitter sincerity of my heart, over the prospects of destruction?</P>
<P>Surrounded by calamities like these, did not providence direct Charles to save me, as the guardian angel of an unhappy girl? and has not this very Charles preserved his friendship unbroken, and his fidelity consummate ever since the day of my deliverance?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="44"/>Arguments like these, strongly se∣conded by the feelings of my heart, did I frequently exert, till, co∣operating with the refinements of your conversation, and the charm I never failed to find in your enter∣taining company, I had almost brought myself to believe there was nothing extremely wrong in our in∣tercourse.</P>
<P>Lulled, however, by this pleasing lethargy of the senses, and sung to repose by the syren of tenderness, I argued myself into a transient se∣renity, and indulged the softness which I perceived to be so soothing. We compleated our designs, and returned from our rambles in the
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
English nation and its neighbouring countries, in order to visit together the continent of France. Prepara∣tions you know, Sir, were making for our <HI>route</HI> soon after our arrival in London, and the beginning of the next week was fixed for our departure.</P>
<P>In the interim I met with the in∣jured Cleora, who told me in the most affecting manner, that, though she never wished a re-union with you, it would give that peace to her heart which was long lost, if I would tear myself from your embraces. Agonized by her pleadings, and stung by the sense of having wronged her, I fell upon my knee, and, solemnly in that situa∣tion <HI>engaged</HI> to do what I <HI>have</HI> done.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46"/>I have nothing to do with your family differences Charles, nor shall I listen to the story of either party. Duty and conscience are both con∣cerned in the measure I have taken, and I shall not be made to repent of it, even by the severity of your up∣braidings. It was, nevertheless, too much descending from the native dignity of your disposition—too un∣like the candour of Charles's charac∣ter, to suppose a connection of four years establishment, every day of which produced some evidence of its sincerity, should be sacrificed to the very grossest purposes in the first week's separation. A new acquaint∣ance! What would you insinuate? To what indelicacy do you allude? I
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
have a tear now falling upon that part of your letter, and I wish it had the power to blot both the senti∣ment and the recollection of it out of my memory for ever! With great reluctancy shall I admit any ideas that disgrace the elegance of Charles's sensibility. Though duty commands me to quit his protection, my know∣ledge of his many eminent virtues, incline me to cherish his idea, and still love him for his excellencies. I would most gladly consider him as a friend, a correspondent, and a con∣spicuous character: and, though we shall never meet again, the sense of my obligations to him, and his own merits, might be a constant source of innocent contemplation to me:
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
why, Charles will you rob me of so agreeable a refuge, perhaps the greatest the whole world has now to afford me. Do you think Sir, then that I can so soon make a transfer of my affections? can I, think you, in so very short a space of time, <HI>command</HI> them from Charles to any accidental object? have I so convenient a heart —so obedient a versality? what do you take me for? but indeed I de∣serve it all; she who can bring her∣self to sleep upon an unsanctified pil∣low, four long twelve months, may well be supposed to perpetrate any thing that is wrong; and therefore I forgive you: although, in justice to myself, I must observe how I shudder, and how the blood runs from my
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
heart, at the bare suggestion of such perfidy.</P>
<P>Indeed you wrong me; and I can∣not bear you to entertain such ideas: even though by entertaining them yourself, <HI>my</HI> image would be the sooner obliviated. Though you found me a fallen woman, I am not con∣stitutionally a wretch of purchase, Sir. Your many amiable lessons of mora∣lity have not been so egregiously mis∣employed. The virtue you have in∣culcated, and the volumes you have put into my hand, have produced effects more salutary: nay Charles, it is to your own instructions — to your own cultivation of my head and heart, that I have been induced to
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
undertake the magnanimity of this action. With respect to resources— such I mean as are necessary, merely necessary to the preservation of hu∣man life, it is impossible that I should be destitute of them, while I have health; and the power who encou∣raged me to a good action will not, I trust, suffer the sharpness of pover∣ty to result from it. But even if he should, I shall eat no longer the bit∣ter bread of adultery, and considering that punishment proportioned to the offence, shall kiss the omnipotent rod without complaining, and supplicate the aids of penitence and patience till my sentence is softened, and the punishment remitted.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/>For the support of life, I have no doubt but that industry will enable me to get a sufficiency. You, Charles, have not suffered me to lead a life of idleness: I am skilled in the elegant labours of the needle: I can embroid∣er: I have some little knowledge of those employments which may assist me from applying to the milliners— nay, and—such has been the effect of your instructions—I am not in∣capable of undertaking the elemen∣tary principles of female education. Here, indeed Charles, I feel a severe stroke from reflection. Who will put any children under the care of a free woman? what parent will trust its rising hopes to one who has her∣self failed?—how long, alas! will it
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
be before the world can be con∣vinced of my penitence, or my pro∣priety! let this be as it will, my re∣solution remains firm as at the first, and Charles must be eternally dis∣united from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Too amiable CHARLOTTE.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEREFORE do you thus officiously labour to extort my approbation? and wherefore have you not left it in my power to cen∣sure you? were there any hard part in your character—had you cha∣ritably left me but one single cruelty, on which I might have founded a reasonable complaint, so that I might have ruminated upon it till I had argued myself into aversion, it might
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
have been more tolerable: but you are obstinately bent upon murdering me by your goodness, and every mo∣ment increase the admiration which I ought to feel daily diminishing. The laws of the land and the pre∣scriptions of custom have thrown the arguments so abundantly on your side, that 'tis impossible to baffle them without seeming to sophisticate. Fool and idiot that I was, to run into the shackle that galls for life, and to bind it like a volunteer slave, on my own leg! and yet, Charlotte, you have assisted Cleora in acting contradic∣tions. Does she not by her own confession militate against a re-union? does she not declare the misery, of which she foresees, it would be pro∣ductive?
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
to what end then—to what end, but the most cruel and unneces∣sary one, should she wish to effect a separation between Charles and Char∣lotte? Cleora and Charles entertain not for each other either hatred or love; indifference is the point be∣tween them. And what virtuous purpose is likely to arise from the parting, in which she has been in∣strumental.</P>
<P>But you are, I see, too immersed in established ideas and the customs of a country, to admit a single ex∣ception to a general rule: although a minute's reflection would convince you that <HI>my</HI> case and <HI>yours</HI> are such
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
as should be absolutely set apart from almost every other.</P>
<P>Ah, inflexible Charlotte, where∣fore have you shielded your heart from the dear arrows of love under the bulwark of such venerable max∣ims—maxims, which, be their gene∣ral tenor ever so admirable, must always allow deviation in certain cases. How easy were it to prove that, in strict speaking, it would be absurd and irrational even to unite again with Cleora. Nay, to put our of the question every other plea, and rely only on the energy of a single argument: the argument of our mutual <HI>indifference,</HI> is it not (demon∣strably) ridiculous to live a love∣less
<PB N="51" REF="57"/>
life with any being? Peculiar circumstances, of temporal distress at the first occasioned my leaving Cleora: I left her with a heart ut∣terly at liberty, and in situations in no degree worse than before I hear∣tily invited, and hastily obtained her hand. Chance, or rather surely the contrivance of some pitying deity, soon afterwards presented before my eye the image of Charlotte. Every thing in human nature that corre∣sponds with the pathetic, united to favour our first interview. It was in the still hour of midnight: 'twas in the hour of misfortune. We were both sufferers: I mourned the bar∣barity of a mother, embarrassed af∣fairs, and anxieties at home: you
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
were sinking under the sense of an equal injury. Social sorrows soon suit themselves to the soul, and the impression that is made in such a crisis, is deep and delicate, indeed.</P>
<P>I see, methinks, the first scene; and I feel what language and sen∣timent denies the power to describe. Ah! Charlotte—Think a little up∣on it!—Prepare for a Picture so particularly interesting. Invoke the powers of imagination, fidelity, and fondness to do it justice.—Lay aside every formal, every unnecessary pun∣ctilio, and give, upon so important an occasion, a full scope to the ten∣derness of nature.—That tenderness, my dear, which was bestowed by the
<PB N="53" REF="59"/>
great God of kindness to
<Q>make the nauseous draught of life go down.</Q></P>
<P>I have, in preparing you for such a portrait inspired myself. The sub∣ject is not to be withstood.—I dedi∣cate it Charlotte to your sensibility. —I address it to your Heart. Did I, in the first Scene, insult you? Did I insult you with any offer that could distress or confuse you? No, Charlotte — some secret impulse it was that withheld me from the deed: some god it was, which inclined me to be inquisitively exact in drawing from you the history of your unhappi∣ness. The tale was told with a sim∣plicity and bewitching artlessness, that might have gained credit from
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
infidelity, and attracted attention from frolic. Let the tears that I then shed, let the kindness with which I have since cherished you, witness the truth of my tenderness and pro∣tection. How were we both affec∣ted? how did our sympathy incline us to approach till our cheeks were as the reposing, yet glowing cushions of each other's. Can you forget the trembling throbs that you felt as I pressed your making hand upon my bosom.—I withdrew till you undrest, and I appeal to you, if I did not sit like the nurse of your chamber by the side of your bed till morning. I found it absolutely impracticable to treat your misery in any other man∣ner: even your beauty, dazzling as
<PB N="55" REF="61"/>
it was, and in the most trying of all situations, was not able to betray me: I paid my court to your heart— to your situation—to your pathetic circumstances, and to every thing but your person: the charms of which, resplendent as I acknowledge they were, I had no leisure to reflect upon, till I had in some measure soothed the mighty anguish under which you were struggling.</P>
<P>I proposed a retreat in the re∣cesses of the country. Such a retreat, Charlotte, my vigilant affection, (ever wakeful, ever indefatigable) soon pro∣vided; and when I had smoothed your own situation, and related to you in the undisguise of my soul, the
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
particulars of mine, I then ventured (and not <HI>till</HI> then) to mention the wishes, which, after all the little de∣laying reluctances that endear ulti∣mate consent, were successful.</P>
<P>Tell not me, Charlotte, of the prude's unfeeling formality. Do not suggest to me the sneer which out∣rageous virtue would cast upon such a transaction. Spirits I know there are (terribly holy, and formidably devout—punctilious as to the minutiae of ceremonials, and negligent of es∣sentials) which would ridicule the delaying reluctances of Charlotte, as artful pretences — What—say they, piously violent—shall <HI>she</HI> who ascends the <HI>nuptial</HI> couch to supply unlaw∣fully,
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
the place of the lawful—to fill the arms that are awefully <HI>pre∣occupied</HI>— who hath, moreover, for∣feited her innocence to the seducer, and been reduced to irreputable re∣fuges — shall <HI>she</HI> assume the character of chastity and all its coynesses, or, indeed, any of those marks of amiable∣ness which ought to distinguish only married modesty, and maiden deco∣rum—? Fie upon her!</P>
<P>Ah! hard of heart, and shallow of head! illiberal, contracted women! Is it not possible for virtue to <HI>be</HI> independent of forms? is it not pos∣sible, in a case like Charlotte's, for the most unspotted purity of mind to survive an accidental violation of
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
person?—But then, you reply, she lived, after all, publicly with the husband of another woman. In any other exigence but her's and mine, it might be impossible to offer a plea of palliation:
<Q><L>Let wealth and honour wait the wedded dame;</L>
<L>August her deed, and sacred be her fame.</L></Q>
Far be it from me, far from the most unhappy Charles be it, to blast the laurels, or wither the roses of con∣jugal life. 'Twere impious, 'twere impracticable. I am not audacious enough to say with Eloisa,
<Q><PB N="59" REF="65"/>Curse on all laws but those which love has made.</Q>
Ah gracious, gracious heaven, that it had been permitted to blend in <HI>our</HI> con∣nection the laws of love, and of the land, natural, with moral institutions! —May never any pair, Charlotte, who love as <HI>we</HI> love, be reduced by the tyranny of their situation, to equal measures: may those whose hearts are equally tuned by <HI>nature</HI> into equal sympathy, find a friend in <HI>fortune</HI> to facilitate their union! Happy—emi∣nently happy they, who are thus as∣sisted, and whose joys receive, in conformity to the custom of nations,
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
their imprimatur of tenderness and possession at the <HI>altar.</HI>—</P>
<P>Our fates, Charlotte, were unfor∣tunately peculiar, and our resolution to run them together was natural, and, set off as they were by ten thou∣sand delicacies, irresistable. Let not our conduct be proposed as an exam∣ple to be adopted, where it is even possible for man and wife to live to∣gether: but let not our fidelity, after we <HI>had</HI> united, be censured too vigour∣ously, or too incautiously.</P>
<P>Weigh these facts well, and they will tempt you to seek again your

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>HOW often must I repeat— how often waft it on the wings of the post, that I must never more repose on the bosom of Charles. Cease, cease then, ah, my dear sedu∣cer, for pity's sake. Do not con∣tinue to croud upon me those images which it is pernicious to entertain! Wherefore—oh thou ungenerous— wherefore do you oppose the most omnipotent of all human arguments, wherefore do you oppose <HI>yourself,</HI> betwixt the severely contending pow∣ers
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
of duty and passion—Ah inhu∣man! it is not without exertions the most violent, and pangs the most accumulated, that I am able to sus∣tain the conduct I have for the last four days observed. Conscious as you are of the <HI>propriety</HI> of that con∣duct, forbear, I solemnly conjure you, to address my partiality again upon the only subject which it can∣not safely contemplate!</P>
<P>The sketch you have delineated of our intercourse, in its first dear, but unfortunate beginnings, is too boldly coloured, and bears too visibly the delicate touches of a master, for the eye of one, who can trace so lively a likeness betwixt the copy and the
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
original. If then you have any re∣gard to the peace of my mind—any to my prosperity—never present to my view again, so animated or so dan∣gerous a picture: rather, I beseech you, turn that most powerful pen of yours into a chaster style: in∣dulge it in the display of subjects more suited to our circumstances. Direct your fine, but too persuasive genius into the proper channel, and let the strength and vigour of Charles's understanding, rather prevent than debilitate the infirmity of Charlotte's; and besides this, how unfair is it to avail yourself of that very feeling in your favour, which your reason tells you it is inequitable to in∣dulge.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="71"/>The copious effusion of tender tears that flowed, as I suppose you cruelly intended they should, in obe∣dience to the commanding sentiments of your last, have a little relieved my heart, at the expence of exhausting my spirits.</P>
<P>I have acquired once more suffi∣cient composure to write to the man who seems resolved to keep me in constant agitation.</P>
<P>You <HI>did</HI> save me, Charles, from distress the most agonizing; from a state the most dreadful: you <HI>did</HI> unite in your character, all the relations; as a father instructed—as a mother admonished—as a brother protected
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
—as a sister entertained, and as a hus∣band cherished. Oh Charles, Charles, it is all well, all great, all a noble climax, till we get to the last expres∣sion. It was only <HI>as</HI> a husband: it was <HI>like</HI> one, that you cherished me. 'Twas out of your power—oh, the malice of fortune—to <HI>be</HI> one, and as that was the case, we should not have united. I should have found that generosity in your <HI>friendship,</HI> which you ought to have denied me in your <HI>tenderness.</HI> I might have been the object of your <HI>benevolence,</HI> without— I write the sentence with a blush burning my cheek—without sharing your bed. How would it have re∣dounded to the honour of my Charles, how officiously would the daughters
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
of distress have trusted his fame to the echo of posterity, if his bounty had been totally unaccompanied by guilt: if he had rescued an unhappy girl from misery, without bringing her out of one error to lead her into another.</P>
<P>Methinks I now see how Charles might at once have procured my honour, and my happiness: and I, who know the goodness of his heart, wonder the scheme, or something similar to it, escaped him. Might he not have placed the unhappy fe∣male far from the delusions of the metropolis, in some sheltering part of the country, where the knowledge of her calamity might never arrive?
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
There, might she not, under the protection of some decent matron, have learned all the arts of useful life, even till the often transmitted bounty of her absent friend Charles, might be no longer necessary to her subsistance. What room had here been for probation—what scope for innocence recovered: and what im∣mortality—what undescribeable sen∣sations must have attended an action so disinterested, so unmixt—so ad∣mirable! Instead of which — but I cannot, I ought not to upbraid you. I acknowledge the delicacy of your deportment when it was the most essential, and when very, very few would have therefore bestowed it. But let us drop the subject: assist me
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
not treacherously, to the recollection of scenes, which I wish, and ought to forget. Surely, surely it is not now a time to receive them in the memory. Ah, Charles, why did not heaven allow our first meeting to have preceded your union with Cleora: then, with what a transport, a transport sanctified by religion, should I—but it is unavailing to wish: we are parted eternally: nor can even such an epistle as your last, adorned as it is with all the glowing graces of language, and artfully ad∣dressed to every passion that alarms the sex, make me revolt from that steady principle I have fixt to my∣self, in the deliberation of my soul, as the rule of my future conduct. If
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
therefore you set any price upon the pleasures of our continued corre∣spondence—for I will forfeit even your letters rather than read myself into a relapse—let this ultimate, this repeated assurance, satisfy you once for all. In a word, Charles, let it teach your heart to be contented with a gratification, somewhat less terrible than that which would terminate in the perdition of the afflicted, but, alas! still</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. CHARLES to CHARLOTTE.</HEAD>
<P>INVULNERABLE, and unrelent∣ing as you are, I have the right of a painter to finish my picture. Hard would it indeed be, were I denied so trifling a liberty as that which the pen allows, when I obey your too rigid injunctions in keeping from the apartment which I know to
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
contain my treasure. Think, madam —oh, that cold word—think, Char∣lotte, of the severe restraint I impose upon myself! I know the very house in which you sleep—if you indeed <HI>can</HI> sleep—and yet I desist from going to make enquiries in which I am so much interested.</P>
<P>And are you alarmed by the faintly drawn sketch of our first week's con∣nexion? Alas! how very poor, how very unequal was all which <HI>then</HI> past, when compared to the months, and years that succeeded it! a dew drop to the deep, and main world of wa∣ters! Carry your imagination in re∣trospect to the time when we first yielded to the exigence, and agreed
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
to live in the same house; when, in all tender respects, we agreed to consi∣der ourselves as—united people. Look back to the very night, ever precious to love-sick remembrance, when you first indulged the solicited embrace. Till after the attention of many days, I did not dare to intimate the hopes of a conquered heart, nor even at last, till I had reconciled you to every part of my hapless situation—till we had both lamented the bar that pre∣vented a public sanction. Paint to your fancy the joy that was then realized, when you first permitted me, half consenting, half denying, to draw the curtain betwixt us and every interruption — I can say no more: I refer you to the powers of
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
imagination—It was not the <HI>unsoul'd</HI> debauch of a dissipated pair: it was not the delirium of two young people, sedulous to snatch the hasty revels of a night's voluptuousness! but it was the unaffected transport of sentiment and taste, of body and mind, consolidated: not a vein in our hearts that did not thrill to the emo∣tions of sympathy: animated by the fire of real love, not a pulse about us that did not leap to salute its hindred pulsation. Remember, above all things, our next morning meeting at breakfast: the sighs which we then wafted over the tea-cup: the tears which were scarce contained within their sluices of crystal: the various flushings of the countenance,
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
and our aukward-enough endeavours to conceal the confusion which was thus rendered the more apparent, all gave silent, but delicious testimony, that the mutual approbation was compleat.</P>
<P>Perhaps you will say, that this might be the energy of juvenile desire: the mere enthusiastic riot of the agitated senses—the transient fever of inflamatory spirits. How easy were it, in opposition to this, to prove its origin from a more pure and permanent source. Reflect, I prithee, fair fugitive, on the scenes which succeeded. Consider what diversity of events happened <HI>after,</HI> to cool the blood, and settle the senses. Examine the train of misfortunes
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
which arose rapidly one out of ano∣ther. Did not my whole patrimony, and all my hopes of elevated circum∣stances, sink suddenly before me? did not the hardened creditor then take his advantage of my calamity, and hunt me with a blood-hound industry, from to place? was not my health invaded in consequence of my anxiety, and were we not both reduced to uncertain resources? was not this aggregate of affliction enough to quiet the impetuosity of mere animal inclination? surely it was; but they only rendered <HI>us</HI> still dearer to one another: the burdens were heavy, and each was therefore emu∣lous to carry the greatest load of them: we had even a sort of jea∣lousy
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
lest the one should encroach upon the share of the other. Ten∣derness and transport presided over our very difficulties—Ah! how often in the desolate moment, when the whole hemisphere of hope was cloud∣ed, have we watched the fall of the tear upon the cheek, and kist it away? how frequently have we caught the sigh while parting from the lips? great woes we reconciled into sentiments of moderation; and eve∣ry gale of good fortune, from what∣ever corner of her compass it blew, was swelled by love into enchant∣ment: the beauty of a flower; the paint of a tulip; the fragrance of a rose; the sudden lustre of the sun; an evening walk; or the morning pro∣spect
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
over our breakfast, painted by the gay pencil of imagination, were more than a match for the empty purse, the ill-natured accident, or miseries of the greatest magnitude. And, can those who have gone for the service of each other through the fiery trial, ever forget, ever ulti∣mately separate? Of all paradoxes, it is to me the most irreconcilable.</P>
<P>I conjure you then by the memory of our past misfortunes, than which even the recollection of extacies is not more endearing—I conjure you by the memory of our pleasures, of which we have had our proportion— I conjure you by the wishes you cherish for my health; by the many
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
miseries of a situation that calls aloud for constant attentions; in short, Charlotte, I conjure, implore, and challenge you, by all that you hope, and all which you dread, to suffer me to enforce the pleadings of my heart at <HI>your own lodgings:</HI> I will obey every injunction—ah! thou de∣lightful tyrant—imposed upon me: the click of the clock shall bring me to the moment of your assigna∣tion: I shall enter your apartment with all the tremors of a lover, and yet I will not, till you permit me, speak of love: I will anticipate the commands of your tongue, and watch the time to depart from the waving of your finger, the nod of your head, or the turn of your eye—More than
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
than the power of a sultaness shall attend you in this interview—Only admit me once—to tea, to break∣fast — to dine — to sup — I cannot Charlotte—I swear by the heart you have carried forcibly away from me —I cannot, any longer, support your absence. Do not then hurry me into violence, but indulge, for this once, my passion, and trust to my prudence, and my promises. Farewell, farewell.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>IS this your solemn engagement? pressing for an interview already. To what end do you think I left you Sir? Was it to give myself a few days unnecessary agony, to in∣volve you in needless calamity, and then to repent upon my folly, and re∣turn again to the errors I have left? I am angry that you think me guilty of so much inconsistency. What a child must you believe me? and yet how do you oblige me to be even with you. For shame, Sir, for shame; you want the philosophy of
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
an infant. You have devoted several of the years of your youth to the study of the sciences, you are deeply read in virtuous compositions, and yet you are more feeble than the babe.</P>
<P>To be outdone in a good action by a woman, by the very wo∣man whose undemanding and heart have been, as it were, the work of your own hands: whom you have made what she is —To let <HI>her</HI> sur∣pass you in fortitude! Blush, blush, and rise into the ambition of excel∣ling her.</P>
<P>From the very arguments that you draw as motives of my return,
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
I can extract the most forcible rea∣sons for my desisting from a re∣union, even supposing that there was no personal criminality attending it.</P>
<P>Wherefore should I hang as a clog at the foot of a man already op∣pressed by the heavy hand of cala∣mity? whatever you may think, it is no real testimony of regard to share your miseries without being able to relieve them. To behold you struggling with your fate, with∣out the power to better it, and ra∣ther adding <HI>to,</HI> than taking <HI>from,</HI> your embarrassments. No, Charles; trust me, we can both do more to∣lerably alone, at least for the pre∣sent: in the course of a little time, for∣tune
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
may be generous to one of us, <HI>which,</HI> is a point of no moment: our persons only, and not our purses, are divided: it will be the same thing whether the shower of prosperity falls upon Charles, or Charlotte: I hope neither of us shall at any time be capable of separate interests, and that neither of us shall be too proud to receive assistance at the hand of the other. As to your part, your talents will recommend you, <HI>wheresoever</HI> or <HI>howsoever</HI> you exert them; and you cannot long fail of conquering the inconveniences which at present sur∣round you. Charlotte's society, how∣ever dear, was rather an impedi∣ment than any thing else, to Charles's advancement, and he will now be
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
admitted into connections which were before impenetrable. We may a∣muse ourselves, my dear friend, with the idea of despising the customs of our country, and the forms of our church: nay, we may attempt to soothe ourselves with the opinions of ourselves, and a narrow circle of our private friends, but if the voice of the public, and the established modes of religion are against us, it will be in vain that we receive a <HI>partial</HI> approbation. It is not only politic, but morally just, that the general clamour should be raised against a couple in our situation. The disagreements that pass under a man's own roof, and the quarrels or feuds which divide the husband from
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
the wife, do not authorize an open defiance of either the laws of man, or the commands of God: nor will the world, however proper the se∣paration, ever enter into the intri∣cacies of circumstance, or pathetic of passion that throws the divided husband into the arms of another woman. I am still willing to hope, Charles, that our offence will be mi∣tigated by the God of mercy, upon account of the many peculiar temp∣tations and exigences that belonged to it: in strict speaking, perhaps, there may not be any greater degree of guilt in our late connection, than if it had immediately succeeded a divorce from your Cleora: but when I am appealed to by a pleading wife,
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
who charges me with seducing the the affections of a husband; when I am branded by that wife, as the art∣ful and infamous cause of her child's misery, and her own, amongst all her friends and acquaintances; when I am held up as the terror of mar∣ried women, at the very time that I know I would have at any time yielded the society of Charles to to more lawful claims; how do you think I can bear to live under this load of half-merited ignominy, and half-undeserved reproach? the truth will break, like the sun, through all disguising interceptions: the delicacy of your passion for me, Charles, led you to conceal the fact in regard to my real situation. Wherever you
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
went, the brilliance of your wit and the polish of your genius, together with the public evidences you have given of it, attracted notice, en∣sured popularity, and commanded curiosity—You took me by the hand, and presented me in all our excursions as your <HI>wedded wife:</HI> I did my best to support the character, I would have given worlds to have realized it: but even in my happiest moment, Charles, I felt a pang at my heart, and apprehended a discovery that would have overwhelmed me with the blushes of confusion. In the course of our rambles, your sanction pro∣vided for me several amiable friends. I had too much veneration for the <HI>name</HI> of wife to injure it by any
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
light, or unbecoming behaviour; and I have the felicity to reflect, that my deportment under this assumed character, was in all respects, con∣jugal and exact: well was it for me, nevertheless, dear Charles, that our passion for travel, did not allow us to stay long in a place. Your si∣tuation must soon have been pub∣licly known; even the political <HI>dis∣guise</HI>
of your <HI>real</HI> name must have been seen through; your fatal pre-engagement with Cleora would have been detected, and the endearing coun∣tenance that was before shewn me, while I lay under the shelter of a charming imposition, would be ig∣nominiously withdrawn. That this, in part <HI>has</HI> been the case, you can∣not
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
but remember: I have occasion∣ally been met by an old acquaintance of yours, who hath officiously cir∣culated the secret of our connexion, and my character became in an in∣stant suspected, or at least ambi∣guous.</P>
<P>The industry with which I applied to those accomplishments in which it is the chief glory of women to excel, and the books and masters which you recommended to me for that purpose, soon polished simplicity into a degree of refined knowledge, and made me more deserving my Charles's society. And yet, my friend, the agonies of my heart increased with the instruc∣tions of my head. Objects and ac∣tions
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
soon presented themselves to me in a different light from that in which I had been accustomed to behold them: the days of girlish giddiness were past, and the sedater reflections of the woman succeeded. From a state of rusticity and village igno∣rance, I was able to think profoundly and compare accurately; a nicer sense of right and wrong began to take place; an aweful admiration for il∣lustrious characters, and a more than enthusiastic ambition to reach them, seized upon my senses: proportioned to the augmentation of my intellec∣tual powers, rose into greater lustre the sensibilities of my soul; and, un∣der the influence of these cultivations, all flowing from the generous stream
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
of Charles's fondness, think what I must in the cool hour undergo, at the thought of living in a state so palpably condemned by mandates above and below; and so forcibly reprobated by every law, divine and human.</P>
<P>It was not, Charles, over the exi∣gences of a precarious fortune, it was not for the loss of your estate, nor was it even for the gradual de∣clinings of your health, that half those tears were shed, which in different places, and at different periods, flowed from me. Studious of your serenity, how often have I repress'd the sigh that was half ready to break its way through my bosom: arm in arm as
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
we walked affectionately together, amidst the perfumes of the spring, or the fragrant profusions of the summer; delighted too as I was with the faith∣ful testimonies of the warmest passion that ever nature rendered mutual, even then, in seasons so sacred to composure, the bitter idea would overtake me, and I have been com∣pelled to complain of some transient pain of the person, to hide from my companion the anguish of the heart. Nay, Charles, I have often sought out a hiding-place when my heart was overcharged, to relieve it by tears. That Cleora and you could not live amicably together, that I was the woman of your choice, that incidents perfectly uncommon united us, that
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
we both lived in the strictest fidelity, that our passion was as elevated as ever inhabited the human bosom, and that we were every thing that is pre∣cious to each other, were by no means counterballances to the censure of the world, the violation of moral obligations, the strokes of my own conscience, and the claims of Cleora, which my avow'd residence with you, <HI>seemed</HI> at least to intercept.</P>
<P>Collect yourself sufficiently Charles, to put these several sentiments toge∣ther: consider them one by one, as you arrange them in due order, and form them into a whole. When you have done this, quiet I beseech you the disorders of every rebellious pas∣sion,
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
and let reason, in her robes of sobriety, sit in judgment. The sen∣tence which she passes will command your attention: methinks I see her from her aweful throne, in the center of the human heart preparing to speak —hark, Charles, I hear her voice, and it shall decide between us.— Persevere Charlotte, persevere in these resolutions, she says. "Forbear Charles, forbear to throw thy tempta∣tions again in the path of the peni∣tent."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. CHARLOTTE to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR last short letter was as a cordial to the spirits of a swoon∣ing creature. Noble, noble youth, how agreeably you flatter me! and is it possible that Charles can be a con∣vert to the sentiments of Charlotte? has she been so happy as to vindi∣cate her own conduct, and kindle in his heart the sparks of imitation?— imitation did I say? no; my dear friend has twice the power and ten times the goodness of Charlotte, if he will but exert them. Have I not
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
known him melt and soften into sym∣pathy at the pitiable circumstances of a distressed enemy? have I not seen the tear of gratitude in his eye, and his hands folded together, for pain alleviated, danger escaped, differences accommodated, and comforts multi∣plied? is he not the friend of all that want, of all that wish? hath not nature directed his hand to his purse to divide with the indigent or the soliciting, the last efforts of his liberality? doth not his <HI>own</HI> miseries teach him to feel for <HI>others,</HI> and suggest to him all the finer obliga∣tions of morality?</P>
<P>And can such a character, can such an exalted spirit, long remain insen∣sible
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
to a duty of the greatest magni∣tude? impossible, impossible! 'Tis I, only I, have been to blame, in wind∣ing my fatal image, and destructive affections, round his heart, till it became entangled beyond the power of extrication. Long ago would this excellent young man have recovered the dignity of his duty, had not I prevented it. I should have slown before: since his delicacy was too great to quit <HI>me,</HI> my virtue should sooner have urged me to quit <HI>him.</HI> Perhaps by this time, he might have quite forgotten me, or only at most have recollected me with the indiffer∣ence I deserve.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="107"/>It is, however, some consolation, that I have at last been equal to the impulses of my reason, and I cannot but hope the most salutary effects will arise from them. Already my dearest friend (for as such I shall ever con∣sider him) is open to conviction: to be <HI>so,</HI> is one great step towards every thing laudable and desirable: to see the path of virtue, and to be pleased with it, is a powerful induce∣ment to pursue it without any suture deviations. I rise every morning more reconciled to my separation, and I can command my thoughts from the image of Charles, when I find them wandering that way, with the cost only of a few tears: my slumbers are not indeed sound, nor
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
can I frequently close my eyes; but I can meditate without distraction, and know the direction of the only man upon earth whom I—I—I whom —whom—I—I say I can reflect upon the very spot, where I suppose Charles to be sitting, without passing by his door, or knocking at it for admit∣tance: for <HI>that</HI> admittance, which I now hope, and believe he will, after the lapse of a few months, refuse me, except upon the terms of an ordinary acquaintance. — No Charles, no: not an <HI>ordinary</HI> acquaintance neither. I could not bear to receive from <HI>you</HI> the forms of compliment, or the cold civilities of a mere well-bred deco∣rum. If we ever do again see each other, let it be with kindness, with

attention, with friendship, and with any thing <HI>from</HI> the extremes either of relapsing fondness, or fashionable dis∣regard: it would be extremely auk∣ward—perhaps it would be utterly impossible for Charles and Charlotte ever to meet upon so ceremonious a visit: nor will it, I dare say, be ne∣cessary. The passion will be altered, the sensibilities of love will be ex∣tinguished, but the sentiments of a pure and established friendship, may, and <HI>must</HI> remain.</P>

<P>A WEEK's silence, my dear Charles, must sure have done great things: you certainly find it for your ease to lay down the pen which used so frequently to address Charlotte; and, therefore, I submit to the suspension of your correspond∣ence. Possibly I am by this time an object only of friendly, and un∣disturbed contemplation. I will en∣deavour to rejoice at the supposition: 'tis what I ought to do.—Now then, my friend, summon yourself to the undertaking: I have made the <HI>first</HI>
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
sacrifice to virtue; do you collect all your strength to sustain a <HI>second!</HI></P>
<P>Your wife is now in London, Charles, and the child, which you have so long and anxiously wished to fondle in your arms, is now blooming in beauty, by the side of her. Your barbarous mother (vo∣luptuous in her age, and wicked in her weeds) denies any longer to sup∣port or educate the babe, and the little fortune is at present locked up, and is likely to remain so till the sale of that estate of which you have been iniquitously robbed, is com∣pleated. In the worst dilemma, how∣ever, your talents are always a suf∣ficient resource, for the subsistance of
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
human life. She who indeed loves, will love in all circumstances: she who feels as she <HI>ought</HI> to feel, will follow her object into the worst of all possible situations—What say you to an interview with Cleora? can you not obliterate the idea of the subjects which parted you, and visit each other, without a past unneces∣sary reflection? I have been several hours in her company. There is nothing in her person but what might attract a husband's attention: her understanding is even masculinely strong. She doats upon the child you have presented to her. She denies the infamous charge that either malice, or wantonness brought against her fame: she is young,
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
handsome, accomplished, well born, your real wife, and in distress, oh, hea∣vens! can such a heart as Charles's re∣main hardened, or can he close his eye upon such a picture— a picture, glowing with the two principal portraits of his own family?</P>
<P>Admitting, however, that you can∣not feel upon this occasion all the luxury of a love-match; admitting, that Cleora wants the power to de∣light; ought she not to be received as a married wife? and though you may want ability to be transported, yet cannot you entertain enough of that friendship, which you always allow to our sex, to live within the limits of propriety? in fine, Charles,
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
if you can avoid absolute aversion on the one hand, and altercation (to which I am sure you are not by nature inclined) on the other, it is a plain point of honour and consci∣ence, to invite her again to your arms.</P>
<P>Believe me, my friend, she is the only woman in the creation I could bear to see there: but I have been the <HI>seeming</HI> instrument of keeping you from her—the <HI>real</HI> one I am sure I have not—and therefore it would give me a pleasure inexpressible to bring you together, even before I have totally conquered my own par∣tialities. Do Charles, do endeavour to give my vanity the gratification

If you bear as ill the third elopement of Charlotte, as you did the first and second, I shall dread to see you: sure never did a young man possess so unfashionable a fidelity: and yet I cannot blame you: the value of the object justifies the constancy and vio∣lence of the passion.

The beauties of your Charlotte, both mental and bodily, are indeed too attractingly eminent to be easily worn from the memory of a man, who hath not only possess'd, but so great∣ly contributed to polish them.</P>
<P>I have long known her merit; long paid to it the tribute of my admira∣tion; and as long lamented the bar that prevented the union of which she is so truly deserving. From the ripening refinements of her mind, however, and from the ardent preci∣pitation of her temper, tinctured as it is with a little both of enthusiasm and romance, I apprehended some∣thing of this sort would ensue from
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
the meeting of her and Cleora, should that ever happen.</P>
<P>How unlucky is it that the point is on all sides, too nice and critical to be spoken to. I most heartily wish all wives well, and all lovers happy: above all other things I have <HI>ever</HI> wished it upon solid motives: their hearts were moulded for each other: the joys, sorrows, evil, and good, they have mutually sustained in the course of a long, and faithful interchange, must have bound them in chains of peculiar force. And yet, as the matter <HI>has</HI> fallen out, what has my friend to do, but to exert his phi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>hy, and call all the powers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is assistance.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="125"/>I am heartily glad you are in Lon∣don, where uneasiness of any kind may be whirl'd off, much sooner than in the country. The shades are in∣fectious: rural objects, and especi∣ally to a poetical mind, are absolutely so many distractions. I would not have you by any means venture into those parts of the country where you have of late been used to reside. The idea that should not be indulged, will obtrude itself in a moment: every thing you behold, from the leaves of the tree, to the husbandman at his labour, will revive the treacherous image you should eradicate.</P>
<P>Rather, my good friend, pursue a different course: however reluctantly,
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
rush into mixt and multiplied society. Indulge not the softness of relaxing solitude. Engage for a short time in all the frivolous scenes of busy existence. Let the great soul stoop a little, and condescend to be amused by innocent levities. Superior as you are, I would now advise you to fre∣quent the places of public resort — and, in short, I would advise every thing gay and airy, except down∣right dissipation. Against that I would caution you; for you already know its ineffectuallity. I shall be in town on Thursday, and will de∣dicate my time totally to you. In the mean while, pray think of Char∣lotte only as a departed friend; as one who does, and must ever wish you

I am honestly the friend of Charles and Charlotte: what then is to be said upon this trying crisis? I will only say, that if the smallest degree of either's happiness depended upon me, my power should be ex∣erted before it could be solicited.

I have gone suddenly from the ex∣tremes of melancholy to those of madness. I called upon a vacant acquaintance, who never felt a poig∣nant woe in his life, who laughs at tenderness, and snaps his fingers at love, and, in the very stupor of my soul, strolled with him into a tavern. I am this moment every thing but delirious, and I have compelled my colleague in dissipation, to drink prosperity to every step of Charlotte —at least at every second glass—In this state of <HI>capital</HI> elevation, what will become of me for the rest of the night, heaven knows; but as I am cer∣tain of being both sick and sorry to∣morrow, I am resolv'd not to be either to night.—Heigh—heigh—oh!

Templeton, what machines we are! obedient to the breath of every passion, tost into tempest by every gust of disappointment or desire. What a fever we are in from fifteen to five and twenty; what an ague overtakes us soon after that, till we are frozen to death and good for no∣thing—Oh! these violent transitions —I lay down my pen to pledge you in a bumper of good wishes for the health of Charlotte. I would mur∣der my brother if he refused the toast of my heart—Never was I so strongly inclined to break my pro∣mise, and go abruptly to her apart∣ment. I could now talk to her like an angel: I could charm her with

claret-caught eloquence, were she adamant from top to bottom.</P>
<P>"Hot with the Tuscan grape, and high in blood,"—by my soul, Templeton, I am just at this time a a match for every thing that could happen to me—I could smooth the wrinkles of her dear indignant brow— I could press her beloved hand with a tenderness so gentle—I could ad∣vance to her rosy lip with so pathetic an humility, a countenance so touch∣ing, and a sigh so delicate, that I should certainly conquer all her scru∣ples, and allure her once more to the arms that are ever extending involuntarily, to embrace her. The fellow who has been the companion

of my revels, is both too headless and too heartless to continue any longer — His dull eye twinkles in drowsiness, and he had rather, I per∣ceive, hug his <HI>pillow,</HI> than the god∣dess of beauty—The wretch abso∣lutely yawns. Oh the negative—!

<P>DEAR, and justly offended Charlotte, forgive me! The agonies I have felt, and still feel from your reproaches, are even more insupportable than the absence which made me rush into the behaviour that deserved them.

<P>When the partner of my intoxi∣cation left me, I was in the street; scarce sensible in my head, and unable to keep my heels.

the next morning, to have part that night in your company. The little likelihood of this drove me to despair, and calling a coach, I or∣dered the driver to carry me to your lodgings. About twenty yards from the house I pulled the check-string, and alighted: the moon was in her meridian, and I walked on till I came opposite your window. The shutters were closed; the streets were quiet, and not an object near, except the watchman, whose night-box was sta∣tioned within five paces of your apartment. I twined my arms in a melancholy folding, and directed my eye, as I stood fixed, to that part of the mansion which I knew you occupied. There is a lane which

leads to the back of the house, and I got staggeringly upon the wall that separated the property. Here, Char∣lotte, as I stood upright on the ridge, I commanded the adjacent apart∣ments.—The extreme warmth of the night had induced the inhabitant to suffer the sash about a third part open, and the cooling breezes of midnight rewarded the design. Ah! God! what were my sensations, when, levelling my eye to the casement, I saw, by the assistance of the moon-beams, (at this time uncommonly bright) a dress that I knew! At the edge of the toilet lay that very hus∣sive which I presented to you so very lately, and whose first employment was to contain the needles which as∣sisted
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
in making the ruffles you left unfinished. The spotted handker∣chief, the cap, the hat, and even the garters you yourself knitted, were there. Spread upon a chair, at a small distance, was a packet of pa∣pers, partly unfolded, perhaps the correspondence of Charles—and the curtain on the female side of the bed was undrawn: at the foot it was impenetrably and enviously pinned close together. Imagine, oh! ima∣gine, my situation! for I cannot de∣scribe it. The watchman neglected to inspect the lane, though he sat almost at the beginning of it. Love's auspi∣cious god had surely charmed him to rest, for he did not even call his hour after the clock had struck. I re∣mained
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
still undiscovered, and could not persuade mvself to remove. How shall I paint what followed? ah! beloved woman, pardon and pity me! I brought my ear even with the edge of the window-frame, and listened: what did I hear? even the balmy breath of my Charlotte, heaving somewhat interruptedly in slumber. I opened my lips, if aught of the perfume would reach me, that I might inhale it. Five minutes, or more than five, did I continue in this attitude; and then — mighty love assist me — then did I hear the dearest of women, start∣ing from her sleep, exclaim— "This should be <HI>his</HI> pillow—here should his cheek repose—ah!
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
Charles, Charles, why did we ever meet? this parting will distract me" —My heart at this time prompted me to discover myself, and I trembling∣ly put my hand to the sash, and heaved it higher—I could have step∣ped into Charlotte's bedchamber with ease: another lift would have carried me into her arms; but the pullies rattled, you called loudly to know "who was there," and I was compelled to descend from the walls of paradise.</P>
<P>The abruptness with which I de∣scended, brought me headlong to the ground, I cut myself with pieces of broken glass, and other rubbish that had been thrown into the lane.
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
I had just risen, when I once more looked at the window, where, to compleat my misery, I saw the dis∣robed, lovely, and beautiful Char∣lotte, pulling down the sash.</P>
<P>Agitated as I was, I dared not speak. I kept my promise with you, even in drunkenness, and was silent under all these touching circumstan∣ces. But what did all these efforts of honour cost me? I thought my senses would utterly have left me!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. HAMLET TEMPLETON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>FOR heaven's sake, my dear Charles, be more guarded: you will destroy the happiness both of Charlotte and yourself. She is
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
palpably jealous of you: every syl∣lable in her letter declares it. Her tenderness for you is even greater than ever. I conjure you, therefore, not to injure her: continue still to consider her silently as your sister, and I prophecy that something will happen in the course of a little time, to make her as essentially your wife, by the laws of the land, as she is evidently already by the laws of the tenderest love that can possibly be reciprocated. At least give her the indulgence of a short period. I still expect to see you happy together, and I am persuaded, if you let for∣tune take her own play, without un∣seasonably interrupting her, she will contrive matters in your favour, till
<PB N="144" REF="150"/>
all shall work together for your good. Persecutions and searchings after her at present, will only defeat your purposes. View her, therefore, I again conjure you, as the dearest relation in the world, who cannot possibly live in the same house with you. Surely there is a most delicate consolation in believing yourself most passionately beloved by an <HI>absent</HI> friend. That you <HI>are</HI> passionately beloved, and that you will continue to be so, there is not the smallest doubt: and, give me as a friend, leave to tell you, that, to suppose you are <HI>not,</HI> is a poor compliment to Charlotte: your incredulity, in this case, argues your want of con∣fidence. Depend upon it, if she
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
who has torn herself from you, ever finds it again in her power (I mean in the power of her feelings) to re∣turn, she will not hesitate to crown the warmest wishes of her amiable companion, who, both by habit and inclination, must be too dear to be soon forgotten. Do you think she <HI>has</HI> forgotten you? oh, Charles, you cannot be so ignorant of the work∣ings of nature, nor can you be so insensible to the peculiarly soft heart of her, whose absence you are de∣ploring. Take my word for it, that were you to meet twelve-months hence, your first interview would not be sustained like persons who had buried the remembrance of each other. I judge not romantically,
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
but from a knowledge of you both: I judge from the scenes of lively, and lasting endearment you have both experienced: you can no more for∣get one another, than you can forget yourselves. Many a sad hour does she feel, as well as Charles, and much anguish must she undergo to support and continue these triumphs of her delicacy. Once more, there∣fore, I desire you to let things take their course, and, by some stroke of providence, Charlotte will assur∣edly be restored to you. I am not able to settle my business here so expeditiously as I could, for your sake, wish. But I must insist on your letters giving me all material occurrences, since it is impossible

<P>GOOD God, Charles, what a life do you make me lead! and what real misery hath distin∣guished the night and the day since the arrival of your last! how can you be so ingenious to torture your own heart and mine? Your scene at my window thrills me with horror. What a time to be exposed to the open air: careless and intoxicated too as you were! what wretchedness must attend your prospect! How could the im∣petuosity of your passion suggest such
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
an expedient; dangerous in itself, and painful in its consequences? I hope, however, you have not cut yourself alarmingly: pray get the best advice: glass sometimes sticks within the skin, and gangrenes. Oh! for heaven's sake, take care. Had you staid till the noise brought me to the window, what would have become of us both? to have denied you admittance, would have been, in such a situation, impossible: to have admitted you would have been a fresh gall to those wounds of ho∣nour which I am trying to heal. If you regard either my health, my happiness, or my life, never put me again to such severe trials.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="156"/>If, Charles, the scenes that suc∣ceeded this shocking one at my chamber window are such as an eye, not wholly abandoned, may dare to look upon, you may send it to me. I can, however, too readily guess the scope of it: and yet it was, me∣thinks, a strange heart, that could just quit the most pathetic object in the world, and find a gratification, the next minute, in the grossest.</P>
<P>Write, nevertheless, and faithful∣ly write, the honest truth. Tell me how happy you have been made by the miserable she whom gold allured to the man she possibly never saw before. Oh! Charles, where has been your delicacy! or if your pas∣sions

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. HAMLET TEMPLETON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to CHARLES.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE met an adventure that I think may draw off your mind, in some measure, from its present fatal object of contempla∣tion; and therefore I will describe it as accurately as my memory permits. You cannot too atten∣tively apply yourself to those scenes which amuse the imagination and soothe the fancy.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="160"/>At the house of Mr. — where I now am on a visit (from which I cannot yet politely disengage self) dined the other day, six people of both sexes; amongst them a stripling, who complained bit∣terly that he had been abused by the lady of his heart, who, after a court∣ship (and all its costly consequences) of five years, had left him in the lurch; kept his presents, stolen his affections, and turned him adrift, in favour of a stupid fellow with a smooth face, a laced coat, and a well-turned pair of legs. This poor swain made a fool of himself all din∣ner time, could drink little, eat less, sighed every second, and at last so∣lemnly declared he would renounce
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
the sex, and set out the next week to seek for indifference, in rambling round the habitable globe.</P>
<P>After this declaration, he sat silent and melancholy for a long time, and really infected the whole company: at length an old gentleman that sat next him, tapp'd him softly on the shoulder, and said, "he was in hopes he did not know in what <HI>real</HI> misery consisted; and so, continued he, as we are all mighty <HI>English,</HI> and in∣clined to be pensive, I will tell you the heads of <HI>my</HI> history, from which you will be able, perhaps, to deduce a very useful lesson: namely, that happiness hates to be <HI>hunted,</HI> and is very seldom caught by those, who
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
<HI>violently</HI> pursue her. She detests pressing, and must come a volun∣teer into the service of mortals."</P>
<P>"All our misery, or at least the greatest portions of it, arise from the want of settled and consolidated sentiments—in other words, from submitting to the violence of various passions, without sticking to any one of them upon principle. This has been my misfortune; take care that it is not yours. I am now, you see, in the decline of life, and yet, from the time that I came to years of discretion, as <HI>indiscreet</HI> people too often call them, I have been cha∣cing different shadows; and fluctuat∣ing, tempest-tost, betwixt opposite
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
opinions. At my first coming into the world, a mere noviciate in all respects, (as it were, in the very morning of exigence) fancy, and curiosity threw before my eye a thou∣sand gay and glittering appearances. I could neither engage in a dance, or make one at a dinner, or attend a concert, or visit any place of public diversion, without receiving some un∣lucky impression in favour of objects either recommended by their novel∣ty, or to which I was invited by the ardour of my temper. I, like you, had a free hand, a liberal soul, and a susceptible heart: my spirits were lively, my ideas excursive, and fancy for ever on the wing. The ruling propensities of my nature
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
were social, and, I cultivated with a vigour peculiar to young people, all the friendly and interesting con∣nections."</P>
<P>"To rescue my friend, or to prove my fidelity, to him, I set at nought hazard, embarrassment, and enter∣prize, with all the enthusiastical ve∣hemence of a knight-errant. My ef∣forts were without the least merce∣nary mixture, and my opinions con∣ceived and admitted without any suspicion. Having indulged this luxury of the young man for some time, till certain tokens of insince∣rity somewhat cooled my ardour, I was taught by experience, the neces∣sity of caution, and found it whole∣some
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
to alter a little the system I had adopted: instead, therefore, of falling in love at first sight, of conferring in∣discriminate favours, of fixing pro∣miscuous friendships, or of lavishing offers of service to all men, without caution or distinction, I was tempted to enter into intercourses of a more stationary kind: my appetites were now less refractory: imagination had enjoyed her frolic, and the curiosity of a rambling, romantic heart was satisfied. I now resolved to begin the world on a new principle: I courted a young woman eminently beautiful, and obtained her hand: from this moment I entertained no∣tions, views and wishes, utterly the reverse of my former ones: fortune—
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
interest—children—family and poste∣rity, all crouded upon me: the shil∣ling, which in my late bachelor-state I should have toss'd carelesly away, I turned very deliberately, and placed it as an accumulated twelve-pence in my drawer."</P>
<P>"At the end of a year my wife presented me with a similitude of herself; and the moment it came into the world, I imagined it gave so sacred an addition to my character, that, I remember well, on that very day I bustled into my barber's shop with an unusual strut, and ordered a supernumerary row of curls to my peruke, the better to figure as the father of a family. The succeeding
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
year gave me a son, with whom I was no sooner provided, than I be∣came anxious to provide a fortune to support him. To accomplish this, need I say, that I adopted the most circumspect maxims. I gave no∣thing without knowing to what end. I engaged in a good business, enter∣tained but seldom, threw myself as little as possible in the way of plea∣surable temptation, rose up early in the morning to the account book, and knowing my infirmity (for you must know I always loved <HI>wine</HI>) I kept the bottle out of sight. Yet, in reward of this self-denial, I eat hearty, slept sound, and repaired the constitution, which the career of the former part of my life had deplora∣bly
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
shaken. For several years I ap∣plied myself to the maxims of gain, and, in the end, obtained by such industry a considerable fortune."</P>
<P>"About this period my sentiments underwent <HI>another</HI> total alteration: from the domestic friend and man of business, I shifted to the man of magnificence and parade; and just as I had, by dint of infinite drudgery, obtained a good fortune, I took it into my head to spend it like a fool. As you are in <HI>love,</HI> young Sir, you know something about human in∣consistency, and therefore will not wonder at this apparent lunacy. Well, Sir, I took it into my ridi∣culous head, as I was saying, to pur∣chase
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
a piece of ground on the side of a hill, in the county of Somerset: upon this hill, I had the nonsensical ambition to build a spacious house, and in this house, to my shame be it spoken, I placed pictures and paint∣ings, which, as the learned in those matters <HI>told me,</HI> were extremely fine and valuable. I now no longer listen'd to the chatter upon change, the jargon of Garraway's, nor the stupidity of the stocks. I bustled no more in business, took my cash out of trade, set up a chaise, and commenced the <HI>eminent merchant retired from</HI> ways, <HI>to live upon his</HI> means. I turned a bleak, bare hill behind my villa, into a shrubbery of sirs, and the steep descent from be∣fore my front door, I converted into
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
a garden, in which I placed statues of all the great folks; and, that the matter might be compleat, I ordered a pond to be cut in the centre, that I might have at once wood, water, and fish into the bargain. My wife, however, soon complained that the walls were damp, my children were constantly afflicted with colds: my gardener discovered, that nothing either useful or beautiful would grow, upon account of barren ground; and the neighbouring gentry, after paying a compliment to my taste in building, pitied me on being unfortunate in the <HI>situation.</HI> I made no more ado, Sir, but upon this, I pull'd (like a true baby tired of my plaything) the whole edifice down, even to the corner∣stone;
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
and, in the rage of my heart, hurried with my family again to Lon∣don, where I took lodgings, and, in mere despair and shame, shut myself up for several days."</P>
<P>"My fortune, acquired by the di∣ligence of many years, was too sub∣stantial to be much hurt by a single folly. I had indeed thrown away up∣wards of two thousand pounds, and I had got a pretty deal of experience. Now mark the reverse: from that day to this, I do not believe I have misemployed or misplaced a single penny. You see me now in the last stage of my journey. My wife is in heaven, and my children are in good circumstances: one of my boys has
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
made a very good piece of arable out of that very ground which was repro∣bated by the indolent gardener: I have rebuilt the house, so as to make it fine, and warm enough for a farmer; and my third son has persuaded me to buy a pretty parcel of land contiguous to it. As to myself, after all the fro∣lics and vagaries of youth, I have something to line the easy chair of old age: I have an old woman to rub my ancles when the gout hath wrapt them up in flannels; my bed is the softer for being my own buying, and though I do not bid every puppy put his hand into my purse, yet, if he can prove to me that he is not a rogue, and is guilty only of raggedness, I shall never be churl enough to refuse
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
him a cast coat that hangs idly col∣lecting dust upon a peg, nor will I send him away in the winter, without warming himself against the weather, by a warm seat in the chimney-corner. Thus young, Sir, you see how fatal it is to indulge imagination: I was the sport of it for a long time, and happy was it for me, that I conde∣scended, in the season of the grey hair, to lead the life of reason."</P>
<P>Here, my dear Charles, the old gentleman ended his story, which, though not absolutely in point, was truly entertaining, and enriched by very pertinent and salutary observa∣tions. In all events it will answer a very good purpose, if the recital of it
<PB N="168" REF="174"/>

<P>I HAVE health, or at least strength enough returned to vindicate my∣self to you; for I feel, that I must ever remain additionally uneasy till I stand fair and unsuspected in your thoughts and opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="175"/>True it is, that I wandered into a house of ill reputation, and did it with a view of burying the image which haunted my repose. The utmost, indeed, that could possibly be expec∣ted from such an effort, was not plea∣sure, but alleviation of pain. Heaven knows I did not hope for happiness from the embraces of venal beauty, but merely to deaden for a moment, the sense of intolerable anguish; and even this was attempted in the absence or lethargy of every cool and rational faculty. Shall I confess to you, that I sent a creature of convenience for a wretched female, who depended on her daily violations for subsistence? the messenger delayed, and my spirits sinking in the <HI>interim,</HI> I swallowed a
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
bumper of champaign, and drank to the health of Charlotte, even in my debauch. As I was pouring down the third glass, now almost daylight, I heard the rustle of silks upon the stairs. What a sensation did this trifle produce! but, ah! how unlike <HI>that I</HI> had been us'd to feel, when the step of Charlotte animated my expecta∣tion. A female came; shewy, labo∣riously adorned, and, as she soon told me, just out of bed. I began immediately to make comparisons: they were indeed <HI>odious.</HI> I look'd in the eyes, for Charlotte's love-born languishment, and I found in their stead artful ogles, misusing the lustre of what might once have been innocently bright. I surveyed
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
the face for tender sensibility; the form for engaging deportment, and the dress, for the union of elegance and judgment; instead of which, I beheld confident aukwardness, and a flaunting variety, betraying at once the taste and the trade. The lady, however, to whom long habit had rendered every thing indifferent but finery, called up a look which signi∣fied an entire compliance. I must own to my dear friend, that time, place, and opportunity, all favoured. Ah! madam, there was but one thing wanting to compleat the scene. There was only wanting— <HI>inclina∣tion.</HI> In a word Charlotte, confess yourself deceived in me; confess that I am less infamously unfaithful

I was pleased to see many politely ready to fill his glass of good wishes; but a per∣son at the other end of the table re∣peated her name two or three times sarcastically, and at last, in a kind of half whisper, told his companion that she was to be <HI>had</HI> at—, but that her price was confoundedly high. I desired an explanation of this— smoke the <HI>favourite,</HI> said the gen∣tleman, simpering to his compa∣nion.—The companion called to order, and I sat down: we drank freely, and though my heart lay burning within my bosom, I did not revive the subject, 'till the toast came

round to the person who had insulted me. He proposed a lady: I drank her health, and then apologizing to the master of the treat for being un∣able to stay longer, withdrew.</P>
<P>I retired hastily into a room be∣longing to the same tavern, and soon found from my landlord, the name and quality of the person which at present employed my thoughts: he was an half pay officer of —'s re∣giment. Pen and ink being brought, I wrote as follows:

<HEAD>To Lieutenant A—.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR profession leaves your courage unsuspected. Without commenting, therefore, on wanting the manners of a British soldier, I have only to hint, that you have <HI>in∣sulted</HI> a gentleman, who is waiting for you where the bearer will privately conduct you. I am stepping out to prepare <HI>properly</HI> for your reception, as I presume neither of us are prepared in that way; but I shall return im∣mediately.</P>
<P>After I had folded up, and sent the waiter with this billet, I went to a
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
gunsmith's in the neighbourhood, and soon provided a brace of pistols, with which I returned. The officer sent a verbal message by the servant, that he should not attend to such kind of engagements 'till the company broke up, and perhaps after that he might be in a humour to correct a stripling, who was hot enough to fight for his w—. Stung beyond measure at this, I ran abruptly into the dining-room, and placed myself opposite to the insulter. He was that minute entering into what he was pleased to suppose the history of our former separation, having heard, as it appeared, some absurd story on that subject. He broke off upon my en∣trance, and filled his glass: just as he
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
was lifting it to his lip, I rose, and in a whisper told him my contemptible opinion of a <HI>scoundrel,</HI> especially when he happened to disgrace a cockade. The colour of rage immediately rose over our hero's countenance, and he threw the contents of his glass into my face. All measures being now taken between us, I withdrew a second time, and the lieutenant was held by his companions.</P>

<P>I WENT to a coffee-house, that luckily faced the door of the tavern, so that when the lieutenant came away it would be impossible for him to escape unseen. In about an hour he came out by himself without his hat, as if he had stolen from the company, upon some necessary pre∣tence, and was desirous to find me. I shewed myself.—The lieutenant beckoned to me, and I followed him. With the first opportunity
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
he called a hackney coach, into which we both got, and rode in it sullenly till we came to the apartment of the Lieutenant. Both of us threw down a shilling for the fare, because either disdained the obligation, in such a ease, of being treated. He conducted me into a large well furnished din∣ing-room, where, after having turned the key, he begg'd pardon for not attending me at the first summons, and proposed an immediate accom∣modation of differences.—We fought —he conquered—I fell.—</P>

<P>I am mightily tickled with the compliment you pay my generosity, at the expence of my prudence. As much as if you had said to a lady, madam, I admire your eyes, if they were not in the way of your nose, and I am charmed with your teeth, only it is a pity they overhang your lips. — Between you and I, Sir, it is not

<P>If I will give you an order for this sum, you will live more <HI>oeconomically</HI> —so you <HI>can</HI> live more oeconomically,

can you? why, you are a prodigal by your own confession, and I have a great mind to sink the half of your allowance from this day, till you are pinched into prudence! I can't con∣ceive where the plague you got that cursed talent for lavishing money! none of my family, nor any of your mother's, were ever spendthrifts. We were all upon the saving order. Zounds, sir! I have had three sets of buttons upon one suit of cloaths: but you scorn to set any thing off savingly, and by the way of Cheap∣side, as I used to express myself. I have absolutely heard you laugh at soling a pair of shoes; you never would suffer my taylor to <HI>turn</HI> cloth of eighteen shillings <HI>per</HI> yard;

Zounds, sir! what a low-spirited dog you must be! to run into such a horrid place, with a coat, a shirt, and an old pair of stockings!</P>
<P>To be plain, young man, I do not expect any good from you while you are so consumedly liberal, and ready to give away your money to every coxcomb or impostor that asks for it. But 'tis as I ever said, "lightly come lightly go." Be that as it may: I will not send you a single shilling to

Every fellow that dares to lift up his hand against the life of another, ought to smart for it; and I should be sorry, for any one to escape out of such an infamous en∣counter without the loss of a limb, or a scar at the least. If the truth was known, I don't doubt but your friend fought for a wench, or because he was drunk, or because he wanted better and wiser employment.

writing pathetic letters before the nervous system could bear such alar∣ming concussions, I would not, on any account, have you take any no∣tice of this friendly hint to my pa∣tient. He might misconstrue it. Young men of lively spirits, and animated tempers, are apt to mistake. <HI>You,</HI> however, see my motive, and will take your measures accordingly. I cannot but use this opportunity to applaud the dignity of your reso∣lutions in regard to the separation. 'Tis an effort even superior to the virtue of the Spartan Ladies: 'tis Roman—'tis Christian! How much ought you to be celebrated for so il∣lustrious an action! and how infinite∣ly ought Cleora to sound your praises!
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
at the same time, my good lady, are you not a little too enterprizing to continue the correspondence? was it not a little too much in the novel strain to come in a boy's habit, and display such various beauties to the eye of Charles, in such a situation— softened as he was by sickness, touched as he must be at the discovery? you recollect to what an embarrassment he was reduced: did not he faint? did not he fall lifeless on the pillow? and was it not with great difficulty you yourself could support the con∣flict? suffer me to say, such trials, if frequent, would stagger the firmest philosophy, and I doubt, it is at best rashness to put too much con∣fidence in our own strength when we
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
oppose it to those passions which too often turn strength into weakness. It is certainly your duty to avoid the temptation as much as possible, and this you can do, only by assiduously avoiding every thing that reminds you of the object. Don't you know, my dear Madam, that in epidemic distempers, we are only secure, while we escape the touch of the contagious person? and with respect to wounds of the mind, they are like those of the body; if we venture abroad too soon, or, thinking our∣selves quite cured, if we run hastily into circumstances that hurt us before, we shall, in all human probability, have a return of our complaint; and a
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
relapse, in either case, is often worse than the first attack.</P>
<P>To drop, however, the language of my profession, and speak as a moralist, I must every way, and by every argument, recommend it to you to lay aside the corresponding pen: every line in every letter stirs the embers, which, if not meddled with would go out, till, in the end, the fatal passion which at first kindled the original flame, would be utterly extinguished. But, I beg pardon. I am too hastily assuming the soft authority of friendship. I confess, madam, your merit has greatly in∣terested me in your welfare; and <HI>this,</HI> with the duty I owe to my pa∣tient,

tears of tender congratulation into my eyes. It is the 18th of August! my watch, which hangs at the head of the bed, points betwixt the hours of eight and nine! It is the anni∣versary morning of my Charlotte's birth! it is the returning day of the year, that gave to the world one of the best and loveliest of women! the sun darts chearfully into my chamber: the sky is uncommonly azure! I have opened the casement, and am saluted with a breeze more balmy and serene, than I ever felt in my life. There is a grape-vine run∣ing along the wall, till its tendrils ambitiously twist round my window, and come mantling into my bed∣room. The foliage on the outside is
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
uncommonly luxurious! and since I have been confined, a red-breast has nested amongst the leaves. He is this moment in the sweetest thrillings of his domestic song! Even so near the bustle and buildings of the me∣tropolis, I have all the advantages of rural life! Every thing around me seems to compliment my Charlotte! What then must I feel upon the sub∣ject? how must I be touched—with what an ardent sincerity must I wish this day, and every revolving one— every eighteenth of August—how —how, I say, must I pray—how sup∣plicate the powers of happiness and health that
<Q><PB N="237" REF="243"/>
<L>This day may be always sacred;</L>
<L>No mourning, no misfortune happen on it;</L>
<L>That it be mark't with triumphs and rejoicings;</L>
<L>That happy lovers still may make it holy</L>
<L>And ever choose it to endear remem∣brance!</L></Q>
From the bottom of my heart I hail the return of this delightful morn∣ing. And yet, Charlotte, how cruelly busy is fancy in the breast and brain of a man under certain influences? what a train of objects now use be∣fore me? what a vision is Imagi∣nation drawing? how she swells upon the canvass? what a glow in
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
her colouring? what animation in her touches? there is character in every stroke of her pencil; her figures are from the life. She has a hand that throws Raphael into despair. Her exact similitudes captivate the eye, and her resemblances subdue the heart!</P>
<P>Methinks I now see how Charlotte employs the present day; she invites the numerous circles of those that wish her well: the feast is prepared: the lovely entertainer in the bloom of beauty and youth, sits at the head of the table as goddess of the ban∣quet. She delights more by her senses, her wit, and her politeness, than by the delicacies of her board.

And yet can it ever Charlotte, ah! can it ever be forgotten, in what Charles used to engage upon this day! will not his attention to the very hour, the minute—the second of her birth, be long remembered? With what a more than bridal vigilance did he watch the returns of this auspicious aera! how did he fondly busy himself in birth-day preparations—love con∣stant, exalted love inspired, his con∣duct upon these occasions. It was love that invited the sun to shine on that day with a conspicuous lustre: it was love that provided the orna∣ment, and decorating novelties which were then, for the <HI>first time,</HI> to be worn: it was love that wept over the sparkling glass: love it was which
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
gave the congratulating kiss—and it was love which smiled as the day closed, and as the indulging night advanced, to give you, all accom∣plished, to my embraces.</P>
<P>Surely these recollections will, even in the midst of natal festivity, revive those sentiments in the sympathizing bosom of Charlotte, which will bestow one tender sigh to the memory of affection, and</P>
