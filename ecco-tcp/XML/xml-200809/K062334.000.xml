<HEAD>THE NUNNERY: An ELEGY.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>REtirement's hour proclaims the tolling bell,</L>
<L>In due observance of it's stern decree;</L>
<L>Each sacred virgin seeks her lonely cell,</L>
<L>And leaves the grate to solitude and me.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Now throws the western sun a fainter glare,</L>
<L>And silence sooths the vestal world to rest,</L>
<L>Save where some pale-ey'd novice (wrap'd in pray'r)</L>
<L>Heaves a deep groan, and smites her guiltless breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Save that in artless melancholy strains,</L>
<L>Some Eloisa whom soft passion moves,</L>
<L>Absorpt in sorrow, to the night complains,</L>
<L>For ever bar'd the Abelard she loves.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Within these ancient walls with moss o'erspread,</L>
<L>Where the relenting sinner learns to weep,</L>
<L>Each in her narrow bed 'till midnight laid,</L>
<L>The gentle daughters of devotion sleep.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>Of wantonness the pleasure-breathing lay,</L>
<L>Or laughter beck'ning from his rosy seat,</L>
<L>Or vanity attir'd in colours gay,</L>
<L>Shall ne'er allure them from their lonely state.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>For them no more domestic joys return,</L>
<L>Or tender father plies his wonted care,</L>
<L>The nuptial torch for them must never burn,</L>
<L>Or prattling infants charm the ling'ring year.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Oft do they weave the chaplets pictur'd gay,</L>
<L>To deck their altars and the shrines around;</L>
<L>How fervent do they chant the pious lay?</L>
<L>How thro' the length'ning isle the notes resound?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>Let not the gay coquette with jest profane,</L>
<L>Mock their veil'd life and destiny severe;</L>
<L>Nor worldly beauty with a sneer disdain</L>
<L>The humble duties of the cloister'd fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>The glist'ning eye, the half-seen breast of snow,</L>
<L>The coral lip, the bright vermilion bloom,</L>
<L>Awaits alike th' inexorable foe;</L>
<L>The paths of pleasure lead but to the tomb.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Nor you, ye vain, impute to these the fault,</L>
<L>If flatt'ry to their fame no trophies raise,</L>
<L>Where thro' the dome with grandeur's treasures fraught,</L>
<L>The num'rous fopplings lift the voice of praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Can artful phrases or alluring words,</L>
<L>Bid the pale cheek assume a second prime!</L>
<L>Can ev'n Apollo's sweetly-sounding cords,</L>
<L>Arrest the speedy steps of conq'ring time.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Perhaps in this drear mansion are confin'd,</L>
<L>Some whose accomplish'd beauty can impart,</L>
<L>Each soft emotion to the sternest mind,</L>
<L>And wake to extacy the beating heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>But pleasure flies them a forbidden guest,</L>
<L>Deck'd with the flow'rs in youth's gay path that bloom,</L>
<L>The clay-cold hand of penance chills their breast,</L>
<L>And o'er the rays of fancy throws a gloom.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>Full many a riv'let wand'ring to the main,</L>
<L>Sequester'd pours it's solitary wave;</L>
<L>Full many a flower is rooted from the plain,</L>
<L>To waste it's sweetness on the desert grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>Some veil'd Eliza (like the clouded Sun)</L>
<L>May here reside inglorious and unknown;</L>
<L>Some like Augusta might have rear'd a son</L>
<L>To bless a nation and adorn a throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>From flatt'ry's lip to drink the sweets of praise,</L>
<L>In rival charms with other belles to vie;</L>
<L>In circles to attract the partial gaze,</L>
<L>And view their beauty in th' admirer's eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>Their lot forbids, nor does alone remove</L>
<L>The thirst of praise, but e'en their crimes restrain;</L>
<L>Forbids thro' folly's labyrinth to rove,</L>
<L>And yield to vanity the slacken'd rein:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>To raise 'mid Hymen's joys domestic strife,</L>
<L>Or seek that converse which they ought to shun;</L>
<L>To loose the sacred ties of nuptial life,</L>
<L>And give to many what they vow'd to one.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>Far from the circle of the splendid throng,</L>
<L>They tread obscurity's sequester'd vale;</L>
<L>Their lonely hours unvaried creep along,</L>
<L>Unfan'd by pleasure's ever shifting gale.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>What tho' they're sprinkled with etherial dew!</L>
<L>With blooming wreaths by hands of seraphs crown'd!</L>
<L>Tho' heav'n's unfading splendors burst to view,</L>
<L>And harps celestial to their ear resound.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>Still grateful mem'ry paints the distant friend,</L>
<L>Not ev'n the world to their remembrance dies;</L>
<L>Their midnight orisons to heav'n ascend,</L>
<L>To stay the bolt descending from the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>For who entranc'd in visions from above,</L>
<L>The thought of kindred razes from the mind?</L>
<L>Feels in the soul no warm returning love,</L>
<L>For some endear'd companion left behind?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>Their joy encircled hearth as they forsook,</L>
<L>From some fond breast reluctant they withdrew:</L>
<L>As from the deck they sent a farewell look,</L>
<L>Fair Albion sunk for ever to their view.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<HEAD>XXIV.</HEAD>
<L>For thee who mindful of th' encloister'd train,</L>
<L>Dost in these lines their mournful tale relate;</L>
<L>If by compassion guided to this fane,</L>
<L>Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>'Haply some aged vestal may reply,</L>
<L>'Oft have we heard him 'ere Aurora's ray</L>
<L>'Had painted bright the portal of the sky,</L>
<L>'At yonder altar join the matin lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>'Where hapless Eloisa sought repose,</L>
<L>'Oft at yon grave wou'd he her fate condole,</L>
<L>'And in his breast as scenes of grief arose,</L>
<L>'Sigh the kind requiem to her gentle soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
<HEAD>XXVII.</HEAD>
<L>'One morn I miss'd him at the hour divine,</L>
<L>'Along that Isle and in the sacristy:</L>
<L>'Another came, nor yet beside the shrine,</L>
<L>'Nor at the font, nor in the porch was he.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>XXVIII.</HEAD>
<L>'The next we heard the bell of death intone,</L>
<L>'And in the fearful grave we saw him laid:</L>
<L>'Approach and read on this sepulchral stone,</L>
<L>'The lines engrav'd to sooth his hov'ring shade.</L>

<HEAD>XXIX.</HEAD>
<L>BY Fate's stern hand untimely snatch'd away,</L>
<L>Does this deep vaulted cave a youth unfold:</L>
<L>He gave to solitude the studious day,</L>
<L>And pity fram'd his bosom of her mould.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<HEAD>XXX.</HEAD>
<L>With lyre devoted to companion's ear,</L>

<LG N="1">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>AT yonder hallow'd rail what scenes appear?</L>
<L>A num'rous train of suppliant nymphs I spy!</L>
<L>Their youthful cheek is pal'd with early care,</L>
<L>And sorrow dwells in their dejected eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>Hark! they awake a solemn plaintive lay,</L>
<L>Where grief with harmony delights to meet;</L>
<L>Not Philomela from her lonely spray,</L>
<L>Trills her clear note more querulously sweet.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Are these the fair who wont with conscious grace,</L>
<L>Proud Ranelagh's resplendent round to tread?</L>
<L>Shine in the studied luxury of dress!</L>
<L>And vie in beauty with the high-born maid!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>The smiling scenes of pleasure they forsake,</L>
<L>Obey no more amusement's idle call;</L>
<L>Nor mingling with the sons of mirth partake,</L>
<L>The treat voluptuous, or the festive ball.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>For sober weeds they change their bright attire,</L>
<L>Of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm;</L>
<L>Veil the white breast, that lately sigh'd desire,</L>
<L>And to the wrapt eye heav'd, th' imprison'd charm.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Unbraid the cunning tresses of the hair,</L>
<L>And each well-fancied ornament-remove;</L>
<L>The glowing gem, the glitt'ring solitaire—</L>
<L>The costly spoils of prostituted love!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Yet beauty lingers on their mournful brow,</L>
<L>As loth to leave the cheek bedew'd with tears;</L>
<L>Which scarcely blushing with a languid glow,</L>
<L>Like morn's faint beam thro' drizzling rain appears.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>No more compare them to the stately flow'r,</L>
<L>Whose painted foliage wantons in the gale:</L>
<L>They look the lily drooping from the show'r,</L>
<L>Or the pale vi'let sick'ning in the vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Let not the prude with acrimonious taunt,</L>
<L>Upbraid the humble tenants of this dome;</L>
<L>That pleasure's rosy bow'r they us'd to haunt,</L>
<L>And in the walk of loose-rob'd dalliance roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>If fond of empire and of conquest vain,</L>
<L>They frequent vot'ries to their altars drew;</L>
<L>Yet blaz'd those altars to the fair one's bane,</L>
<L>The idol they, and they the victim too!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>Some in this sacred mansion may reside,</L>
<L>Whose parent's ashes drank their early tears;</L>
<L>And hapless orphans! trod without a guide,</L>
<L>The maze of life perplext with guileful snares.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>Some that encircled by the great and rich,</L>
<L>Were won by wiles, and deep-designing art;</L>
<L>By splendid bribes, and soft persuasive speech,</L>
<L>Of pow'r to cheat the young unguarded heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>Some on whom beauty breath'd her radiant bloom,</L>
<L>Whilst adverse stars all other gifts remov'd;</L>
<L>Who fled from mis'ry and a dungeon's gloom,</L>
<L>To scenes their inborn virtue disapprov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>What tho' their youth imbib'd an early stain,</L>
<L>Now gilded by the rays of new-born fame;</L>
<L>A second innocence they here obtain,</L>
<L>And cloister'd penance heals their wounded name.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>So the young myrtles nipt by treach'rous cold,</L>
<L>(While still the summer yields his golden store)</L>
<L>In shelt'ring walls their tender leaves unfold,</L>
<L>And breathe a sweeter fragrance than before.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">

<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<L>Tho' white-wing'd peace protect this calm abode,</L>
<L>Tho' each illicit passion be suppress'd;</L>
<L>Still recollection wears a sting to goad,</L>
<L>Still fang'd remorse invades their anxious breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>XVII.</HEAD>
<L>The tort'ring hour of mem'ry this may prove,</L>
<L>Who wrapt in pensive secresy forlorn;</L>
<L>Sits musing on the pledges of her love,</L>
<L>Expos'd to chilly want, and grinning scorn:</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>XVIII.</HEAD>
<L>Forgot, deserted in th' extremest need,</L>
<L>By him who ought to shield their tender age:</L>
<L>Was this seducer this the promis'd meed!</L>
<L>She cries, then sinks beneath affliction's rage.</L>

<LG N="19">
<HEAD>XIX.</HEAD>
<L>Another mourns her fall with grief sincere,</L>
<L>Whom tranquil reason tells she's shun'd, disdain'd;</L>
<L>Repuls'd as vile by those who held her dear,</L>
<L>Who call'd her once companion, sister, friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
<HEAD>XX.</HEAD>
<L>That recollects the day when lost to shame,</L>
<L>She fondly sacrific'd her vestal charms:</L>
<L>Resign'd the virgin's, for an harlot's name,</L>
<L>And left a parent's for a spoiler's arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>XXI.</HEAD>
<L>Imagination pencils to her mind</L>
<L>The father's rage, the mother's softer woe:</L>
<L>Unhappy pair! to that distress consign'd,</L>
<L>A child can give, a parent only know.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>XXII.</HEAD>
<L>The tragic picture fixes sorrow's dart,</L>
<L>While filial passions in her breast revive:</L>
<L>She feels beak'd anguish preying at her heart,</L>
<L>To nature's pangs too sensibly alive!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>XXIII.</HEAD>
<L>If this or similar tormenting thought,</L>
<L>Cling to their soul, when pensively alone;</L>
<L>For youth's offence, for Love's alluring fault,</L>

<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>Oh mock not then their penitential woes,</L>

<L>Nor seek with foul derision to expose,</L>
<L>And give to infamy their tainted name.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>XXV.</HEAD>
<L>Nor deem me one of melancholy's train,</L>
<L>If anxious for the sorrow-wedded fair;</L>
<L>(Tho little skilful of poetic strain,</L>
<L>Whose pleasing music takes the tuneful ear.)</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>XXVI.</HEAD>
<L>I steal impatient from the idle throng,</L>
