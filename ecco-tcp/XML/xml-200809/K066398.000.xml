<HEAD>ODE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Away! ye sweet, but trivial Forms,</L>
<L>That from the placid pencil rise,</L>
<L>When playful art the landscape warms</L>
<L>With Italy's unclouded skies!</L>
<L>Stay, vanity! nor yet demand</L>
<L>Thy portrait from the painter's hand!</L>
<L>Nor ask thou, indolence, to aid thy dream,</L>
<L>The soft illusion of the mimic stream,</L>
<L>That twinkles to thy sight with Cynthia's trembling beam!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
<L>Be thine, my friend, a nobler task!</L>
<L>Beside thy vacant easil see</L>
<L>Guests, who, with claims superior, ask</L>
<L>New miracles of art from thee:</L>
<L>Valour, who mocks unequal strife,</L>
<L>And clemency, whose smile is life!</L>
<L>"Wright! let thy skill (this radiant pair exclaim)</L>
<L>"Give to our view our favorite scene of Fame,</L>
<L>"Where Britain's Genius blaz'd in glory's brightest flame."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Celestial ministers! ye speak</L>
<L>To no dull agent sloth-opprest,</L>
<L>Who coldly hears, in spirit weak,</L>
<L>Heroic virtue's high behest:</L>
<L>Behold! tho' envy strives to foil</L>
<L>The Artist bent on public toil,</L>
<L>Behold! his flames terrific lustre shed;</L>
<L>His naval blaze mounts from it's billowy bed;</L>
<L>And Calpe proudly rears her war-illumin'd head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<L>In gorgeous pomp for ever shine</L>
<L>Bright monument of Britain's force!</L>
<L>Tho' doom'd to feel her fame decline</L>
<L>In ill-starr'd war's o'erwhelming course,</L>
<L>Tho' Europe's envirous realms unite</L>
<L>To crush her, in unequal fight,</L>
<L>Her genius, deeply stung with generous shame,</L>
<L>On this exulting rock array'd in flame</L>
<L>Equals her ancient feats, and vindicates her name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How fiercely British valor pours</L>
<L>The deluge of destructive fire,</L>
<L>Which o'er that watery Babel roars,</L>
<L>Bidding the baffled host retire,</L>
<L>And leave their fall'n, to yield their breath</L>
<L>In different pangs of double death!</L>
<L>Ye shall not perish: no! ye hapless brave,</L>
<L>Reckless of peril thro' the fiery wave</L>
<L>See! British mercy steers, each prostrate foe to save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>
<L>Ye gallant chiefs, whose deeds proclaim</L>
<L>The genuine hero's feeling soul,</L>
<L>Elliot, and Curtis, with whose name</L>
<L>Honor enrich'd his radiant roll,</L>
<L>Blest is your fate; nor blest alone,</L>
<L>That rescued foes your virtues own,</L>
<L>That Britain triumphs in your filial worth:</L>
<L>Blest in the period of your glory's birth,</L>
<L>When art can bid it live to decorate the earth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas! what deeds, where virtue reign'd,</L>
<L>Have in oblivious darkness died,</L>
<L>When painting, by the Goths enchain'd,</L>
<L>No life-securing tints supplied!</L>
<L>Of all thy powers, enchanting art,</L>
<L>Thou deemest this the dearest part,</L>
<L>To guard the rights of valour, and afford</L>
<L>Surviving lustre to the hero's sword:</L>
<L>For this, heroic Greece thy martial charms ador'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
<L>Rival of Greece, in arms, in arts,</L>
<L>Tho' deem'd in her declining days,</L>
<L>Britain yet boasts unnumber'd hearts,</L>
<L>Who keenly pant for public praise:</L>
<L>Her battles yet are firmly fought</L>
<L>By Chiefs with Spartan courage fraught:</L>
<L>Her Painters with Athenian zeal unite</L>
<L>To trace the glories of the prosp'rous fight,</L>
<L>And gild th' embattel'd scene with art's immortal light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' many a hand may well portray</L>
<L>The rushing war's infuriate shock,</L>
<L>Proud Calpe bids thee, Wright, display</L>
<L>The terrors of her blazing rock:</L>
<L>The burning bulks of baffled Spain,</L>
<L>From thee she claims, nor claims in vain,</L>
<L>Thou mighty master of the mimic flame,</L>
<L>Whose peerless pencil, with peculiar aim,</L>
<L>Has form'd of lasting fire the basis of thy fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<L>Just in thy praise, thy country's voice</L>
<L>Loudly asserts thy signal power:</L>
<L>In this reward may'st thou rejoice,</L>
<L>In modest labour's silent hour,</L>
<L>Far from those seats, where envious leagues,</L>
<L>And dark cabals, and base intrigues</L>
<L>Exclude meek merit from his proper home;</L>
<L>Where art, whom Royalty forbade to roam,</L>
<L>Against thy talents clos'd her self-dishonor'd dome.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When partial pride, and mean neglect,</L>
<L>The nerves of injur'd genius gall,</L>
<L>What kindly spells of keen effect</L>
<L>His energy of heart recall?</L>
<L>Perchance there is no spell so strong</L>
<L>As friendship's sympathetic song:</L>
<L>By fancy link'd in a fraternal band,</L>
<L>Artist and Bard in sweet alliance stand;</L>
<L>They suffer equal wounds, and mutual aid demand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<L>Go then, to slighted worth devote</L>
<L>Thy willing verse, my fearless muse!</L>
<L>Haply thy free and friendly note</L>
<L>Some joyous ardor may infuse</L>
<L>In fibres, that severely smart</L>
<L>From potent Envy's poison'd dart:</L>
<L>Thro' Wright's warm breast bid tides of vigor roll,</L>
<L>Guard him from meek depression's chill controul,</L>
<L>And rouse him to exert each sinew of his soul!</L>
