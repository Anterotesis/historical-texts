<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the gardens of the palace at Fulham is a dark recess; at the end of this stands a chair which once belonged to bishop Bonner.—A certain bishop of London, more than 200 years after the death of the aforesaid Bonner, just as the clock of the gothic chapel had struck six, undertook to cut with his own hand a narrow walk thro' this thicket, which is since called the <HI>monk's walk.</HI> He had no sooner begun to clear the way than, lo! suddenly up-started from the chair the ghost of bishop Bonner, who in a tone of just and bitter indignation uttered the following verses.</P>

<P>By the lapse of time the three last stanzas are become unintelligible. Old chronicles say, that towards the latter end of the 18th century a bill was brought into the British parliament by an active young reformer for the aboli∣tion of a pretended traffic of the human species. But this only shews how little faith is to be given to the exaggerations of history, for as no vestige of this incredible trade now remains, we look upon the whole story to have been one of those fictions, not uncommon among authors, to blacken the memory of former ages.</P>
