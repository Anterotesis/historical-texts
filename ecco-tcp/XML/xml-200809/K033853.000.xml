<P>I HAVE many reasons to be flattered with the public reception of this Tragedy, yet I confess my solicitude for its reputation extends further.</P>
<P>Your Ladyship's having permitted me the honour of inscribing it to you, will in some measure gratify my ambition by recommend∣ing it to the reader, whose judgment is not influenced by the adventitious assistance of theatrical decorations and the graces of action.</P>
<P>Where your Ladyship's name appears as a patroness, merit will be expected; and where there is a wish to find any, probably none will pass unnoticed.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>Whatever motive may be assigned for this Address, my principal purpose will be fully answered if your Ladyship accepts it, as a testimony of my gratitude for the favours I have received from the Noble Family to which you are so happily united, and of the perfect esteem and respect of</P>

<SP>
<LG>
<L>WHILE in these days of sentiment and grace</L>
<L>Poor comedy in tears resigns her place,</L>
<L>And smit with novels, full of maxims crude,</L>
<L>She, that was frolick once, now turns a prude;</L>
<L>To her great end the tragic muse aspires,</L>
<L>At Athens born, and faithful to her sires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The comic sister in hysteric fit,</L>
<L>You'd swear, has lost all memory of wit.</L>
<L>Folly, for her, may now exult on high;</L>
<L>Feather'd by ridicule no arrows fly;</L>
<L>But if you are distress'd, she's sure to cry.</L>
<L>She that could jig, and nick-name all heav'n's creatures,</L>
<L>With sorrows not her own deforms her features;</L>
<L>With stale reflections keeps a constant pother;</L>
<L>Greece gave her one face, and she makes another;</L>
<L>So very pious, and so full of woe,</L>
<L>You well may bid her "To a nunnery go."</L>
<L>Not so Melpomene; to nature true</L>
<L>She holds her own great principle in view.</L>
<L>She, from the first, when men her pow'r confest,</L>
<L>When grief and terror seiz'd the tortur'd breast,</L>
<L>She made, to strike her moral to the mind,</L>
<L>The stage the great tribunal of mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the worthies of each clime she draws,</L>
<L>Who founded states, or rescued dying laws;</L>
<L>Who, in base times, a life of glory led,</L>
<L>And for their country who have toil'd or bled;</L>
<L>Hither they come, again they breathe, they live,</L>
<L>And virtue's meed through ev'ry age receive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hither the murd'rer comes, with ghastly mien!</L>
<L>And the fiend conscience hunts him o'er the scene.</L>
<L>None are exempted; all must re-appear,</L>
<L>And even kings attend for judgement here;</L>
<L>Here find the day, when they their pow'r abuse,</L>
<L>Is a scene furnish'd to the tragic muse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5"/>
<L>Such is her art, weaken'd perhaps at length,</L>
<L>And, while she aims at beauty, losing strength.</L>
<L>Oh! when resuming all her native rage,</L>
<L>Shall her true energy alarm the stage?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This night a bard—(our hopes may rise too high,</L>
<L>'Tis yours to judge;—'tis yours the cause to try)</L>
<L>This night a bard, as yet unknown to fame,</L>
<L>Once more, we hope, will rouze the genuine flame.</L>
<L>His; no French play;— tame, polish'd, dull by rule!</L>
<L>Vigorous he comes, and warm from Shakespeare's school.</L>
<L>Inspir'd by him, he shews, in glaring light,</L>
<L>A nation struggling with tyrannic might;</L>
<L>Oppression rushing on with giant strides;</L>
<L>A deep conspiracy, which virtue guides;</L>
<L>Heroes, for freedom who dare strike the blow,</L>
<L>A tablature of honour, guilt and woe.</L>
<L>If on his canvass nature's colours shine,</L>
<L>You'll praise the hand that trac'd the just design.</L>

<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>SPOKEN BY MRS. YATES.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<LG>
<L>IS it permitted in this age severe,</L>
<L>For female softness to demand a tear?</L>
<L>Is it allow'd in such censorious days,</L>
<L>For female virtue to solicit praise?</L>
<L>Dares manly sense, beneath a tender form,</L>
<L>Presume to dictate, and aspire to warm?</L>
<L>May so unnatural a being venture</L>
<L>As a true heroine on the stage to enter?</L>
<L>No, says a wit, made up of French grimaces,</L>
<L>Yet self-ordain'd the high-priest of the graces.</L>
<L>Women are play-things for our idle hours,</L>
<L>Their souls unfinish'd, and confin'd their pow'rs;</L>
<L>Loquacious, vain, by slight attentions won,</L>
<L>By flattery gain'd, and by untruths undone.</L>
<L>Or should some grave great plan engage their minds,</L>
<L>The first caprice can give it to the winds;</L>
<L>And the chief stateswoman of all the sex</L>
<L>Grows nervous, if a fop or pimple vex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Injurious slanders!—in Louisa's air</L>
<L>Behold th' exemplar of a perfect fair;</L>
<L>Just, tho' aspiring; merciful, tho' brave;</L>
<L>Sincere, tho' politic; and tho' fond, no slave;</L>
<L>In danger calm, and smiling in success,</L>
<L>But as securing ampler means to bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor think, as Zeuxis, for a faultless piece,</L>
<L>Cull'd various charms from various nymphs of Greece,</L>
<L>Our bard has center'd in one beauteous whole,</L>
<L>The rays that gleam thro' many a separate soul.</L>
<L>On Britain's and Ierne's shores he saw</L>
<L>The models of the fair he dar'd to draw;</L>
<L>True virtue in these isles has fix'd her throne,</L>
<L>And many a bright Louisa is our own.</L>

<L>No wild ambition, like a pamper'd steed,</L>

<L>The whole way</L>

<L>Dome, temple, portico, so closely fill'd,</L>
<L>The gazers made the wonder. Here and there</L>

<L>Pleasure was mingled with anxiety,</L>

<L>Why we meet,</L>
<L>Is not to canvass our opprobrious wrongs,</L>
<L>But to redress them.—Yet as trumpets sound,</L>
<L>To rouse the soldier's ardor,—so the breath</L>
<L>Of our calamities will wake our fires,</L>
<L>And fan them to spread wide the flame of vengeance.</L>
<L>'Tis not my gift to play the orator,</L>
<L>But in plain words to lay our state before you.</L>
<L>—Our tyrant's grandsire, whose ambition claim'd,</L>
<L>And first usurp'd Braganza's royal rights,</L>
<L>My blood establish'd his detested sway.</L>
<L>Old Tagus blush'd with many a crimson tide,</L>
<L>Sluic'd from the noblest veins of Portugal.</L>
<L>The exterminating sword knew no distinction.</L>
<L>Princes, and prelates, venerable age,</L>
<L><PB N="38" REF="45"/>Matrons, and helpless virgins fell together,</L>
<L>'Till cloy'd and sick of slaughter, the tir'd soldier</L>
<L>With grim content flung down his reeking steel,</L>
<L>And glutted rage gave truce to massacre.</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ALMADA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Now mark how happily the time conspires,</L>
<L>To give our great atchievement permanence;</L>
<L>—Spain is not what she was, when Europe bow'd</L>
<L>To the fifth Charles, and his degenerate son.</L>
<L>When, like a torrent swell'd by mountain floods,</L>
<L>She swept the neighbouring nations with her arms,</L>
<L>And threaten'd those remote,—contracted now</L>
<L>Within an humble bed, the thrifty urn,</L>
<L>Of her exhausted greatness, scarce can pour</L>
<L>A lazy tide thro' her own mould'ring states.</L>

<L>Are the slaves of Spain,</L>

<L>On to the wharf with quick impatient step,</L>
<L>I saw Velasquez press, and in his train</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="47"/>These lurking traitors.—Now, even now, they cross</L>
<L>The ebbing Tagus in the tyrant's barge,</L>

<L>And mark us for their prey.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>Nay then, 'tis past.</L>
<L>Malignant fortune, when the cup was rais'd</L>
<L>Close to our lips, has dash'd it to the ground.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RIBIRO.</SPEAKER>
<L>This unexpected bolt strikes flat our hopes,</L>

<L>There's not a pang</L>
<L>That rends the fibres of man's feeling frame,</L>
<L>No vile disgrace, that even in thought o'er-spreads</L>
<L>The cheek with burning crimson, but her hate</L>
<L>Ingenious to devise, and sure to inflict</L>
<L>In keenest agony will make us suffer.</L>

<SPEAKER>ALMADA.</SPEAKER>
<L>Wou'd that were all—Our dismal scene must close;</L>
<L>Nature o'er power'd at length will leave her load,</L>
<L>And baffie persecution.—But O, Portugal!</L>
<L>Alass unhappy country! Where's the bourn</L>
<L>Can mark the extent of thy calamities.</L>
<L>Like winter's icy hand our luckless end</L>
<L>Will freeze the source of future enterprize:</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="48"/>Oppression then o'er the devoted realm</L>
<L>Erect and bold will stalk with tenfold ravage.</L>
<L>There, there alone, this breast is vulnerable;</L>
<L>These are the wheels that wrench, the racks that tear me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>

<L>A greater power than mortals can arraign,</L>

<L>Say, shall we glut the spoiler with our blood,</L>
