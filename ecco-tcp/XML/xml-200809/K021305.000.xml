<LG>
<L>CLIFTON, rich source of <HI>Heliconian</HI> stream!</L>
<L>Thou teeming topic! and thou lofty theme!</L>
<L>Where art, where nature leads the soul along,</L>
<L>And taste and commerce crown the copious song;</L>
<L>Where vast variety the heart expands,</L>
<L>And giving grandeur opens wide her hands;</L>
<L>With nature's noblest gifts regales the soul,</L>
<L>Each part a paradise—a heaven the whole!</L>
<L>Where health, where vigour quaffs the winnow'd air,</L>
<L>And drives far off the ugly fiend, <HI>Despair.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY muse, O CLIFTON! would thy summits climb,</L>
<L>And hand thy beauties down to latest time;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4"/>To ages yet unborn thy charms display,</L>
<L>In numbers lasting as the lamp of day;</L>
<L>Would <HI>Inspiration</HI> prompt my proud desire,</L>
<L>The song and subject should at once expire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How epic wonders here the soul delight!</L>
<L>There, distant beauties strain th' impassion'd sight;</L>
<L>See rocks coeval with the world arise,</L>
<L>Whose cloud-swept groves seem waving in the skies;</L>
<L>By ages furrow'd deep, with time-plow'd mien,</L>
<L>With adverse frowns, with fractur'd foreheads seen,</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Neptune</HI> rolls his rapid tides between.</L>
<L>See <HI>Wealth</HI> quick flying in the freighted gale,</L>
<L>See East, see West expand th' impatient sail;</L>
<L>Here earth, here ocean, mountains, rocks unite,</L>
<L>And in harmonious discord give delight;</L>
<L>There, princely piles in classic taste express'd,</L>
<L>In <HI>Grecian</HI> garb, in <HI>Roman</HI> grandeur dress'd,</L>
<L>A line of palaces o'erlook the town,</L>
<L>That with a jealous pride the prospect crown:</L>
<L>On different heights they stand in stately strife,</L>
<L>Like rank and dignity in moral life:</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5"/>In various climax court th' attracted eyes,</L>
<L>The objects changing as the structures rise:</L>
<L>From pile to pile a prospect new appears,</L>
<L>And now the hills and now the river cheers.</L>
<L>See num'rous ships with sudden glance shoot by,</L>
<L>The sails and streamers only strike the eye:</L>
<L>Between th' embracing banks, for ever green,</L>
<L>They seem to move on land, their bulk unseen;</L>
<L>By glad propitious gales impatient blown,</L>
<L>With rapid speed and motion not their own.</L>
<L>See next a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dundry.</HI></NOTE> steeple on yon hill appear,</L>
<L>Yon distant hill, the <HI>Proteus</HI> of the year;</L>
<L>From whose oft-changing look, the watchful swain</L>
<L>Foretells the weather, and avoids the rain.</L>
<L>The blue aetherial hills see last uprise,</L>
<L>In azure robe to meet the bending skies.</L>
<L>Here pendent gardens with rich fruits appear,</L>
<L>The rip'ning bounty of the lavish year.</L>
<L>The temple rais'd above the group see sway,</L>
<L>And all th' extended various view survey.</L>
<L>Divine ambition in the choice is found,</L>
<L>Nay taste itself mark'd out the sacred ground;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6"/>With holy pride the lofty seat to shew,</L>
<L>And reign exulting o'er the world below;</L>
<L>Where some on others look with scornful phlegm,</L>
<L>Whilst others look with equal scorn on them;</L>
<L>With mole-hill malice dash the cup of life,</L>
<L>An inch in difference makes the mountain strife:</L>
<L>From proud comparison we quaff our all,</L>
<L>That source of human sweets, or human gall:</L>
<L>At which the restless soul impatient pants,</L>
<L>Begets her anguish, and creates her wants.</L>
<L>Oh frantic fallacy! oh brain-sick need!</L>
<L>Shall thy sleek beaver make my bosom bleed?</L>
<L>Thy better buckled belt make me repine,</L>
<L>Or if thy nails be closer cut than mine?</L>
<L>Shall I my lips with inward anguish bite,</L>
<L>If thy black kitten's tail be tipt with white?</L>
<L>Or if thy leeks than mine should greener grow,</L>
<L>And make thy fancied bliss, my REAL woe?</L>
<L>Envy in courts and cottages will dwell,</L>
<L>Nay climb to heaven itself, tho' born in hell:</L>
<L>In every living bosom lurks this pest,</L>
<L>But reigns unrival'd in the human breast;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7"/>On reason's throne usurps a thorny part,</L>
<L>And plants a thousand daggers in the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE moral here and natural world we see,</L>
<L>In wise gradation, and in just degree:</L>
<L>Where all constructed for one system's sake,</L>
<L>A happy, heterogeneous prospect make:</L>
<L>Where reason's scale from class to class can fall,</L>
<L>And measure equal bounty dealt to all;</L>
<L>Each lot can justly prize, in fortune's wheel,</L>
<L>But not from what we have, but what we feel.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FROM moral strains, let my glad numbers soar,</L>
<L>And yon coincidence with speed explore:</L>
<L>Where strong extremes produce a striking taste,</L>
<L>A <HI>Gothic</HI> building by a <HI>Greek</HI> embrac'd:</L>
<L>In contrast kind, the feasted eye to fill,</L>
<L>And mark the summit of the social hill:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Goldney</HI> acts the meek, the moral part,</L>
<L>And daily works new miracles of art.</L>
<L>Where he like <HI>Moses</HI> makes the water flow,</L>
<L>His gold the rock obeys, but not his blow:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8"/>His gold, that conquers nature's hardest laws,</L>
<L>And fountains from the rocky center draws:</L>
<L>His well spent gold a two-fold transport gives,</L>
<L>The garden gladdens, and the labourer lives.</L>
<L>Such toils refresh at once the heart and head,</L>
<L>Give taste a banquet, and the rustic bread:</L>
<L>Make nature wonder at her thin-wove mask,</L>
<L>And truth survey her own transparent task.</L>
<L>The master's pleasure with th' improvement grows,</L>
<L>In all the rapture, that a parent knows:</L>
<L>When wise discretion weighs th' unerring coin,</L>
<L>And makes his pleasure with his prudence join.</L>
<L>Then sweet ambition bids the heart begin,</L>
<L>For genius feels a paradise within:</L>
<L>And tho' at first her task may seem too hard,</L>
<L>The accomplish'd wonder is its own reward.</L>
<L>Then fancy triumphs, when by judgment led,</L>
<L>And wears the well-earn'd wreath around her head:</L>
<L>Without a blush her own bright work surveys,</L>
<L>Improves the rapture, and enjoys the praise:</L>
<L>A new creation lifts the admiring lid,</L>
<L>Here nature looks abroad, here art lies hid:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9"/>O'er the grand form her mantle meek she flings,</L>
<L>But ornaments are arbitrary things:</L>
<L>Yet even there should fancy never stray,</L>
<L>From nature's path, or seek a wiser way;</L>
<L>Art is but nature in her best array.</L>
<L>With simple elegance she smiling stands,</L>
<L>In blameless garb, put on by <HI>Goldney</HI>'s hands:</L>
<L>Him genius taught the tasteful eye to cheer,</L>
<L>With sober judgment whispering in his ear:</L>
<L>As wise discretion rules the realms of wit,</L>
<L>The happy medium here, he happy hit;</L>
<L>Where each bright incident performs its part,</L>
<L>With inward rapture melts the master's heart;</L>
<L>And each congenial guest with joy invades,</L>
<L>The fountains, grottos, and the clear cascades;</L>
<L>The tall parterres that lift the comely face,</L>
<L>And yield at once such majesty and grace,</L>
<L>With ev'ry growing beauty in its place.</L>
<L>A minor <HI>Stow</HI> on <HI>Clifton</HI>'s crown we find,</L>
<L>In <HI>Epic</HI> meekness, like its master's mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE buildings boast a robe, tho' rich yet chaste,</L>
<L>The robe of judgment, and of ripen'd taste:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10"/>Convenience here is mix'd with manly grace,</L>
<L>Yet ornament but holds the second place.</L>
<L>To human frames these structures seem akin,</L>
<L>With aspect fair, while reason rules within.</L>
<L>These domes discretion decks and fancy cheers,</L>
<L><HI>Palladio</HI>'s stile in <HI>Patty</HI>'s plans appears:</L>
<L>Himself a master with the first to stand,</L>
<L>For <HI>Clifton</HI> owes her beauties to his hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HENCE to the vale, by mountain rocks secur'd,</L>
<L>By nature's own immortal hand immur'd,</L>
<L>The vale, where skreen'd <HI>Avona</HI> sinks and swells,</L>
<L>That warping leads me to the hallow'd <HI>Wells,</HI></L>
<L>I wander joyful, with unbounded glee,</L>
<L>From all I raptur'd hear, and raptured see:</L>
<L>To where sweet health her far-sought balm bestows,</L>
<L>And beauty with re-kindled fervor glows.</L>
<L>Above this fountain of supreme delight,</L>
<L>Two ponderous rocks surprize and please the sight:</L>
<L>With bending brows of nearer terms they treat,</L>
<L>Thro' countless ages essay'd oft to meet;</L>
<L>With grey address the tedious courtship con,</L>
<L>And wish the aerial arch would make them one:</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="11"/>The nuptial bridge sublime their brows would join,</L>
<L>Whilst <HI>Europe</HI> wonder'd at the work divine.</L>
<L>Blenheim <HI>should blush, tho' high her concave swells,</HI></L>
<L>Nay <HI>Venice</HI> veil her bonnet to the <HI>Wells</HI>:</L>
<L>Her proud <HI>Rialto</HI> should no more appear,</L>
<L>But <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> come crowding here;</L>
<L>Can then ambition sleep when GLORY calls,</L>
<L>The MUSE herself shall help to raise the walls;</L>
<L>With <HI>Orphean</HI> sounds the work divine advance,</L>
<L>And make the willing stones in order dance;</L>
<L>Expand the joy-touch'd heart, enlarge the mind,</L>

<L>THE walks see full, see health disclose her hive,</L>
<L>Whilst all the neighbouring objects seem alive;</L>
<L>See bounty there her healing store unlocks,</L>

<L>Distill'd by nature in her richest cell,</L>
<L>Where health sits brooding, and her offspring dwell;</L>
<L>With heaven in council deep, for mortal weal,</L>
<L>Where angels blend the balm, and bid it heal;</L>
<L>There love and beauty revel in the tide,</L>
<L>There grace and vigour wanton at their side;</L>
<L>That with more lustre make glad beauty glow,</L>
<L>Than all the diamonds orient realms bestow;</L>
<L>The cheek to vermil, and relume the eye,</L>

<L>From all his windings in the nerves and limbs,</L>
<L>When thro' the laxed tubes he lazy swims,</L>
<L>The sizy, creeping, tardy, torpid flood,</L>

<L>Those radiant bands their breath about can blow,</L>
<L>And puff the bright battalions to and fro,</L>
<L>These atmospherial files they quick can raise,</L>
<L>And fill the welkin with a warlike blaze;</L>
<L><PB N="40" REF="42"/>Round <HI>Saturn</HI>'s ring, in frolic dance they play,</L>
<L>Bestride the comet's tail, and sweep the milky way;</L>
<L>Through yonder vault, the lightnings flash they guide,</L>
<L>Then on the thunder's rapid vollies ride;</L>
<L>They shoot the stars that glance athwart the night,</L>
<L>Sup in the moon, and safe on <HI>Brandon</HI> light.</L>

<L>A THOUSAND rich improvements round me rise,</L>
<L>And <HI>Bristol</HI>'s new-born beauties charm my eyes;</L>
<L>There embryon plans to ripe perfection swell,</L>
<L>Which time shall foster, and which fame shall tell:</L>
<L>How letter'd taste its progress here improves,</L>
<L>Which sense inculcates, and which wisdom loves:</L>
<L>The dawning mind would drink each classic ray,</L>
<L>And pants impatient for a brighter day.</L>
<L>Here science, like the sun, see radiant rise,</L>
<L>With intellectual beam, through mental skies,</L>
<L>To gild, to gladden all th' improving space,</L>
<L>With taste, with candor, learning, sense, and grace;</L>
<L>To light up all the mind's remotest cells,</L>
<L>Where fancy fledges, and where genius dwells;</L>
<L>To bid the soul her own rich funds employ,</L>
<L>Incrodse her treasures, and her wealth enjoy;</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="43"/>On talents and on taste propitious smile,</L>
<L>To the proud muses rear a pompous pile:</L>
<L>A theatre, that erst at <HI>Rome</HI> might rise,</L>
<L>When <HI>Rome</HI> was valiant, and when <HI>Rome</HI> was wise,</L>
<L>Where tragic scenes shall all their pow'r display,</L>
<L>And comedy shall laugh our cares away;</L>
<L>Where wit and beauty shall with rival rays,</L>
<L>Provoke our wonder, and divide our praise:</L>
<L>There <HI>Bristol</HI> proud, her daughters' charms shall see;</L>
<L>Their polish'd charms the muses theme shall be,</L>
<L>Her florid sons shall stand in next degree.</L>
<L>In bright assemblies see them winding move,</L>
<L>In all the measur'd modes of grace and love;</L>
<L>In labyrinths reciprocal they roam,</L>
<L>Whilst breathing beauties deck the beauteous dome;</L>
<L>Th' accomplish'd pile invites with polish'd air,</L>
<L>The well-bred letter'd youth, the lovely fair,</L>
<L>With chaste delight to meet and mingle there;</L>
<L>The youth in every step new talents show,</L>
<L>Whilst beauty brightens as the graces grow.</L>

<L>HERE health and plenty crown th' adjacent plains,</L>
<L>Whilst ev'ry human bliss at <HI>Bristol</HI> reigns:</L>
<L>Here health and plenty in her presence stand,</L>
<L>Here hospitality oft waves the hand,</L>
<L>With social beckon to the genial board,</L>
<L>Where mirth and friendship all their joys afford,</L>
<L>And converse rises o'er the technic kind,</L>
<L>By wit exalted, and by sense resin'd:</L>
<L>Here music, painting, gain alternate ground,</L>
<L>With magic light and shade, with magic sound;</L>
<L>Where manners soften, and where humour glows,</L>
<L>Where virtue kindles, and where friendship grows;</L>
<L>Here wealth and wisdom with each other blend,</L>
<L>And sense and taste in social strife contend:</L>
<L>Here time leads up the rich improving band,</L>
<L>On gradual step to ripe perfection's hand,</L>
<L>Whilst ruddy commerce crowns her fragrant stores,</L>
<L>With spicey treasures from ten thousand shores;</L>
<L>Thy flood-gate's wealth from both the <HI>Indies</HI> flow,</L>
<L>Avona <HI>richer than the</HI> Rhine <HI>or</HI> Po,</L>
<L>The world's vast tribute to thy threshold brings,</L>
<L>On groaning bottoms, and on golden wings;</L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="45"/>Each tide comes pregnant with a precious load,</L>
<L>And wealth at <HI>Bristol</HI> makes its wise abode,</L>
<L>'Till thence sent rushing through <HI>Britannia</HI>'s veins,</L>
<L>She warms <HI>Europa</HI>'s vitals with her gains;</L>
<L>Augusta <HI>shakes with her the trading hand,</HI></L>
<L>They scatter blessings o'er a happy land;</L>
<L>They bid <HI>Britannia</HI> break the tyrant's chain,</L>
<L>Bid freedom flourish through the land and main,</L>
<L>And o'er the earth extend great GEORGE's reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HAIL happy fountains, hail!—oh, rich run o'er,</L>
<L>With wealth and strength, 'till time shall be no more:</L>
<L>Bid <HI>Britain</HI> soar, her matchless trident rear,</L>
<L>Her glory circle with the circling year;</L>
<L>Bid her high flag o'er nations yet unknown</L>
<L>Triumphant wave, and make the globe her own;</L>
<L>Her freedom, laws from pole to pole prevail,</L>
<L>And justice weigh the world in <HI>Britain</HI>'s scale!</L>
<L>Let faction fall, let red-ey'd rancour end,</L>
<L>Let discord to her native hell descend,</L>
<L>And with her drag her black, her bloated train,</L>
<L>Her bosom scorpions, and her inbred bane,</L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="46"/>With all the stings that in the soul abide,</L>
<L>With meek hypocrisy, and holy pride:</L>
<L>Let fell corruption lift no more the head,</L>
<L>But, trampled freedom! at thy feet lie dead:</L>
<L>Let peace, let truth, advancing hand in hand,</L>
<L>Let love, let loyalty o'erspread the land:</L>
<L>The olive high let <HI>England</HI>'s angel bear,</L>
<L>And time bring on her millenary year:</L>
<L>Let seraphs in her councils oft preside,</L>
<L>Her monarch whisper, and her senates guide!</L>
<L>Let Heav'n's own hand be <HI>Britain</HI>'s strong ally;</L>
<L>Let <HI>Europe</HI> tremble when her thunders fly,</L>
<L>'Till nature sink, and time himself shall die!</L>
