<L>Whose sons display no doubtful worth,</L>

<L>Teach me to paint, in deathless song,</L>
<L>Some darling from thy filial throng,</L>
<L>Whose deeds no party-rage inspire,</L>

<L>Ah! whither lead'st thou?—whence that sigh?</L>
<L>What sound of woe my bosom jars?</L>
<L>Why pass, where Misery's hollow eye</L>
<L>Glares wildly thro' those gloomy bars?</L>
<L>Is Virtue sunk in these abodes,</L>
<L>Where keen Remorse the heart corrodes;</L>
<L>Where Guilt's base blood with frenzy boils,</L>
<L>And Blasphemy the mournful scene embroils?—</L>
<L>From this infernal gloom my shudd'ring soul recoils.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But whence those sudden sacred beams?</L>
<L>Oppression drops his iron rod!</L>
<L>And all the bright'ning dungeon seems</L>
<L>To speak the presence of a God.</L>
<L>Philanthropy's descending ray</L>

<L>Loveliest of angels!—at her side</L>
<L>Her favourite votary stands;—her English pride,</L>

<L>Hail! generous HOWARD! tho' thou bear</L>
<L>A name which Glory's hand sublime</L>
<L>Has blazon'd oft, with guardian care,</L>
<L>In characters that fear not Time;</L>
<L>For thee she fondly spreads her wings;</L>
<L>For thee from Paradise she brings,</L>

<L>Such wreaths of sacred Palm, as ne'er till now</L>
<L>The smiling Seraph twin'd around a mortal brow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That Hero's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHARLES HOWARD, Earl of Nottingham.</NOTE> praise shall ever bloom,</L>
<L>Who shielded our insulted coast;</L>
<L>And launch'd his light'ning to consume</L>
<L>The proud Invader's routed host.</L>
<L>Brave perils rais'd his noble name:</L>
<L>But thou deriv'st thy matchless fame</L>
<L>From scenes, where deadlier danger dwells;</L>
<L>Where fierce Contagion, with affright, repels</L>
<L>Valor's advent'rous step from her malignant cells.</L>

<L>Where in the dungeon's loathsome shade,</L>
<L>The speechless Captive clanks his chain,</L>
<L>With heartless hope to raise that aid</L>
<L>His feeble cries have call'd in vain:</L>
<L>Thine eye his dumb complaint explores;</L>
<L>Thy voice his parting breath restores;</L>
<L>Thy cares his ghastly visage clear</L>
<L>From Death's chill dew, with many a clotted tear,</L>
<L>And to his thankful soul returning life endear.</L>

<L>What precious Drug, or stronger Charm,</L>

<L>Nor Charm, nor Drug, dispel thy fears:</L>
<L>Temperance, thy better guard, appears:</L>

<L>I see the hallow'd shade of HALES,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>STEPHEN HALES, minister of Teddington: he died at the age of 84, 1761; and has been justly called <Q>An ornament to his profession, as a clergyman, and to his country, as a philosopher.</Q> I had the happiness of knowing this excellent man, when I was very young; and well remember the warm glow of benevolence which used to animate his countenance, in relating the success of his various projects for the benefit of mankind. I have frequently heard him dwell with great pleasure on the fortunate incident which led him to the discovery of his Ventilator, to which I have alluded.—He had ordered a new floor for one of his rooms; his carpenter not having prepared the work so soon as he expected, he thought the season improper for laying down new boards, when they were brought to his house, and gave orders for their being deposited in his barn;—from their accidental position in that place, he cauglit his first idea of this useful invention.</P></NOTE></L>
<L>Who felt, like thee, for human woe,</L>
<L>And taught the health-diffusing gales</L>
<L>Thro' Horror's murky cells to blow,</L>
<L>As thy protecting angel wait;</L>
<L>To save thee from the snares of Fate,</L>
<L>Commission'd from the Eternal Throne:</L>

<L>The virtues of thy heart, more active than his own.</L>

<L>Thy soul supplies new funds of health</L>
<L>That fail not, in the trying hour,</L>
<L>Above Arabia's spicy wealth</L>
<L>And Pharmacy's reviving power.</L>
<L>The transports of the generous mind,</L>
<L>Feeling its bounty to mankind,</L>
<L>Inspirit every mortal part;</L>
<L>And, far more potent than precarious art,</L>
<L>Give radiance to the eye, and vigor to the heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest HOWARD! who like thee can feel</L>
<L>This vital spring in all its force?</L>
<L>New star of philanthropic zeal;</L>
<L>Enlight'ning nations in thy course!</L>
<L>And shedding Comfort's heavenly dew</L>
<L>On meagre Want's deserted crew!</L>
<L>Friend to the wretch, whom friends disclaim,</L>
<L>Who feels stern Justice, in his famish'd frame,</L>
<L>A persecuting fiend beneath an angel's name.</L>

<L>Authority! unfeeling power,</L>

<L>O might thy terror-striking call,</L>
<L>Profusion's sons alone enthrall!</L>
<L>But thou canst Want with Guilt confound:</L>
<L>Thy bonds the man of virtuous toil surround,</L>
<L>Driven by malicious Fate within thy dreary bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How savage are thy stern decrees?</L>
<L>Thy cruel minister I see</L>
<L>A weak, laborious victim seize,</L>
<L>By worth entitled to be free!</L>
<L>Behold, in the afflicting strife,</L>
<L>The faithful partner of his life,</L>

<L>Whom this terrific form has frighten'd from their sport.</L>

<L>Nor weeps she only from the thought,</L>
<L>Those infants must no longer share</L>
<L>His aid, whose daily labour bought</L>
<L>The pittance of their scanty fare.</L>
<L>The horrors of the loathsome jail</L>
<L>Her inly-bleeding heart assail:</L>
<L>E'en now her fears, from fondness bred,</L>
<L>See the lost partner of her faithful bed</L>
<L>Drop, in that murd'rous scene, his pale, expiring head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take comfort yet in these keen pains,</L>
<L>Fond mourner! check thy gushing tears!</L>
<L>The dungeon now no more contains</L>
<L>Those perils which thy fancy fears:</L>
<L>No more Contagion's baleful breath</L>
<L>Speaks it the hideous cave of Death:</L>
<L>HOWARD has planted safety there;</L>
<L>Pure minister of light! his heavenly care</L>

<L>Ye nations thro' whose fair domain</L>
<L>Our flying sons of joy have past,</L>

<L>Astonish'd that they flew so fast!</L>
<L>How did the heart-improving sight</L>
<L>Awake your wonder and delight,</L>

<L>Internal bid the soul arise</L>
<L>From joys, that only seem to bless,</L>
<L>From low pursuits, which little minds possess,</L>
